ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells in liver cancer are thought to be responsible for tumor
recurrence and metastasis. However, the factors that mediate this mechanism have
yet to be completely elucidated. In this study, we isolated CD13+CD44+ sphere cells
(SCs) derived from liver cancer tissues and SK-Hep-1 cells, which possessed cancer
stem cell-like properties. Through cytokine array analysis, growth differentiation
factor 15 (GDF15) was significantly increased in SCs. Clinical data showed GDF15
was overexpressed in liver cancer tissues and was positively related to pathological
grading. GDF15 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth and metastasis
of SCs through AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway suppression. Moreover, a PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 inhibited AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway activated by GDF15
and attenuated GDF15-induced proliferation, colony formation and invasion of SCs.
Conclusion: Our studies suggest that CD13+CD44+ SCs may represent a subset of
LCSCs. GDF15 promotes the growth and metastasis of SCs by activating AKT/GSK-3β/
β-catenin signaling pathway. Promisingly, GDF15 could be considered as a potential
therapeutic target in liver cancer.

INTRODUCTION

further investigate the molecular mechanisms of HCC
recurrence and metastasis for monitoring the progress
of  liver cancer  therapy and for developing effective
therapeutic strategies.
Various factors such as cancer stem cell (CSC) and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contribute  to
tumor recurrence and metastasis [5, 6]. Recent studies
suggest that a primary cause of HCC relapse and
metastasis is the persistence of liver cancer stem cells
(LCSCs), which are highly tumorigenic, metastatic
and resistant to chemotherapy [7, 8]. Yamashita et al
[9] suggested that HCC growth and invasiveness were
controlled by a subset of EpCAM+ CSCs. Most recently,
the effect of CD90+ CSCs on enhanced cell motility of
EpCAM+ cancer stem cells was mediated, at least in part,
via activation of TGF-β signaling by CD90+ CSCs [10].
Similar evidence demonstrated that liver-specific Notch
signaling activation was associated with tumorigenesis

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common malignancy worldwide, and the third leading
cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. The worldwide
incidence of HCC varies according to the prevalence
of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Chronic HCV infection is the leading cause of HCC
in developed countries whereas HBV infection is the
leading cause in the majority of developing countries.
Other risk factors that are more common in western
countries include obesity, diabetes, cirrhosis related to
heavy alcohol consumption and others [2, 3]. Although
advances in liver cancer  detection and treatment
have increased the possibility of curing the disease
at early stages, unfortunately, the prognosis of most
HCC patients is still poor, due to high rates of tumor
recurrence and metastasis [4]. It is imperative to

SCs display higher chemo-resistance and higher
clonogenicity

and metastasis of LCSCs [11]. All these studies
demonstrate that LCSCs are a pivotal therapeutic target in
the eradication of HCC. While several possible signaling
molecules  related  to growth  and  metastasis  of LCSCs
have been reported, the factors that mediate this role have
not yet been completely elucidated. Further studies are
needed to clarify the molecular mechanism of LCSCs in
promoting metastasis and relapse of HCC.
In the current study, we successfully isolated
and expanded CD13+CD44+ sphere cells (SCs) derived
from clinical HCC samples and SK-Hep-1 cells,
which demonstrated highly tumorigenic, chemoresistant and metastatic potential. Human cytokine
antibody arrays were applied to screen for cytokines
which may mediate the growth  and  metastasis  of
LCSCs. Colony formation and transwell assay were
performed to investigate whether GDF15 is involved
in the proliferation  and  invasion  of LCSCs in vitro.
Subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumor and pulmonary
metastatic animal models of LCSCs were established to
further study the role of GDF15 in tumorigenesis and
metastasis of LCSCs in vivo. Finally, the molecular
mechanisms of GDF15 involved in tumorigenesis and
metastasis of LCSCs were explored.

One of the important properties of CSCs is their
resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Therefore,
we used three conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to
evaluate the chemo-resistance in SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells.
As shown in Figure 2A, the survival rates of sample1SCs, sample2-SCs and SK-SCs were higher under the
treatment of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (DDP) and
adriamycin (ADM), compared with SK-Hep-1 cells.
Meanwhile, classical multidrug resistance is attributed
to an elevated expression of ATP-dependent drug efflux
pumps that belong to ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters such as multidrug resistance gene-1 (MDR1),
multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 (MRP1) and
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [12]. Our
results revealed that the expression of MDR1, MRP1 and
ABCG2 was significantly increased in three groups of SCs
(Supplementary Figure 1). These data suggest that some
ABC transporters involved in multidrug resistance of SCs
lead to higher tolerance to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Stem cells are considered to be slow-cycling cells.
The cell cycle distribution of SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells
is shown in Figure 2B. Compared with SK-Hep-1 cells,
the cell cycles of the sample1-SCs, sample2-SCs and
SK-SCs were altered with marked increase in the G0/
G1 phase and decrease in S and G2/M phase. Cell cycle
analysis demonstrated that SCs grew at slower rates than
SK-Hep-1 cells. However, three groups of SCs showed
remarkably higher colony formation efﬁciency than SKHep-1 cells (Figure 2C). All these results suggest that SCs
are highly resistant to chemotherapy and display extensive
capacities for proliferation and self-renewal as a possible
CSC subset.

RESULTS
Sphere cells derived from human HCC samples
and SK-Hep-1 cells represent a group of
CD13+CD44+ cells, which preferentially express
stem cell-associated genes
Among the 40 HCC samples and four HCC cell
lines (SK-Hep-1, Hep3B, Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721),
SCs were established and cultured successfully in two
liver cancer samples and SK-Hep-1 cells. The majority
of tumor cells cultured in serum-free medium (SFM)
died, with a few floating cells forming spheres of 3 to 5
cells. After 10 to 14 days, large tumor spheres with bright
appearance and sharp edges were found, each composed
of 100 to 200 cells (Figure 1A). During the formation of
primary tumor spheres, cells were collected by gravity and
dissociated enzymatically for amplification. Meanwhile,
we analyzed the expression of several markers proposed
in the literature to identify LCSCs in the three groups of
SCs. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that all three
groups of SCs co-expressed CD13 and CD44 (Figure 1A),
instead of CD133 and EpCAM (Figure 1B). These data
indicate that SCs derived from human HCC samples and
SK-Hep-1 cells may represent a group of CD13+CD44+
cells. To further determine whether SCs possess stem celllike properties, we examined the expression levels of a
few stem cell-associated genes underlying self-renewal
and differentiation of CSCs. We found that the expression
of Oct-4 and Nanog in these SCs was much higher than in
SK-Hep-1 cells (Figure 1C).

SCs exhibit high tumorigenicity and metastatic
potential in vivo
To determine whether SCs possess higher
tumorigenicity than SK-Hep-1 cells in vivo, we conducted
tumor formation experiments using sample1-SCs,
sample2-SCs, SK-SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells. Various
numbers of SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells, ranging from 100
to 10,000, were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID
mice with weekly monitoring for tumor development.
An apparent difference in tumor incidence was observed
between SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells (Table  1). As few
as 100 sample1-SCs, 100 sample2-SCs and 250 SKSCs were sufﬁcient to induce tumor formation in
immunodeﬁcient mice, and 100% tumor development
was observed in 1,000 sample1-SCs, 500 sample2-SCs
and 1,000 SK-SCs, respectively. In contrast, injection of
up to 5,000 SK-Hep-1 cells resulted in tumor formation
at a lower efﬁciency (1 of 4 injected mice) than in SCs.
Furthermore, we investigated the invasive ability of SCs

in vitro using transwell assay. Compared with SK-Hep-1
cells, SCs showed stronger invasive ability (Figure 2D).
To determine the metastatic potential of SCs in vivo, we
transduced three groups of SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells with
luciferase-expressing lentiviral vectors and injected them
into NOD/SCID mice via the tail vein, respectively. The
original transduction efficiency of luciferase-expressing
SCs and SK-Hep-1 cells is similar (Supplementary
Figure 2). The luciferase signals of the three groups of
SCs were significantly higher than that of SK-Hep-1 cells,
especially sample2-SCs (Figure 2E). The number of lung
metastases was markedly increased in SCs (Figure 2F).
Histological analysis further confirmed that mice injected
with SCs manifested more and bigger metastatic tumors
of the lung (Figure 2G). The foregoing results suggest that
three groups of SCs manifest higher tumorigenicity and
pulmonary metastasis.

against GDF15. As shown in Table 2, 22 of 30 (73.3%)
tumor tissues showed GDF15-positive staining, as
compared to five normal liver tissue samples, none of
which stained positive for GDF15. The representative
data are shown in Figure 3C. GDF15 expression was
increased in moderate (HCC-II) or severe (HCC-III) HCC,
but not in mild (HCC-I) HCC and normal liver tissues.
In addition, ten pairs of HCC and paracarcinomatous
liver (PL) tissues were prepared from the same patient
to eliminate the effects of differences in the genetic
background. IHC and western blotting were performed.
GDF15 expression was elevated in 7 of 10 (70%) HCC
samples (Figure 3D and 3E). These results suggest that
GDF15 is overexpressed in a part of HCC tissues.
To explore any correlation between GDF15
expression and clinicopathologic characteristics of HCC,
we detected the expression of GDF15 in HCC samples
using IHC. The elevated GDF15 expression showed
a significant correlation with pathological grading.
However, no correlation between age, gender and TNM
stage was detected (Table 3).

GDF15 is overexpressed in SCs derived from
clinical HCC samples and SK-Hep-1 cells
To identify the cytokines secreted by LCSCs that
drive tumor recurrence and metastasis, the cytokine
profiles of culture medium (CM) containing SK-SCs
and SK-Hep-1 cells were analyzed using RayBio Human
Cytokine Antibody Array. We found that the expression
of GDF15 in SK-SCs was higher than in SK-Hep-1 cells
(Figure 3A). ELISA further confirmed the increased
GDF15 levels in the CM of the three groups of SCs,
especially in the CM of sample1-SCs and sample2-SCs
(Figure 3B).

GDF15 knockdown suppresses the proliferation
and colony formation ability of SCs, but has no
effect on chemo-resistance
To determine the signiﬁcance of GDF15 in SCs,
we suppressed the expression of GDF15 in SCs using
lentiviral GDF15 shRNA. GDF15 expression was inhibited
in cells transfected with GDF15-shRNA (shGDF15)
in contrast to cells transfected with control shRNA
(shcontrol), by ELISA analysis (Figure 4A). To investigate
the effects of GDF15 knockdown on SC proliferation and
colony formation ability, BrdU and colony formation
assays were performed. BrdU assay showed that for
three groups of SCs proliferation ability was significantly
inhibited in the GDF15 knockdown group compared
with the control group (Figure 4B). Consistently with the
BrdU assay results, GDF15 knockdown decreased SCs
colony formation (Figure 4C). Thus, GDF15 knockdown
significantly attenuates SC proliferation and colony
formation ability, but no significant differences were found

GDF15 expression is increased in HCC
and shows a significant correlation with
clinicopathologic characterization
Elevated expression of GDF15 was previously
reported in serum and tumor samples of HCC patients
[11]. To obtain further evidence that GDF15 expression is
increased in HCC, we performed immunohistochemistry
(IHC) on a human HCC tissue assay. HCC tissues and
normal liver tissues were used for IHC with an antibody

investigated the effects of GDF15 on tumor metastasis
in vivo using a mouse model of lung metastasis. Luciferaseexpressing SK-SCs were transfected with shGDF15 and
shcontrol, and injected intravenously into NOD/SCID
mice. As shown in Figure 4F and 4G, GDF15 knockdown
in SK-SCs significantly inhibited lung metastasis.
Furthermore, HE staining of lung tissue confirmed that
mice injected with GDF15 knockdown SK-SCs showed
fewer and smaller pulmonary metastases (Figure 4H).
To confirm these results, we transfected SKSCs with GDF15-overexpressing and control vectors
(Figure  5A). Our studies demonstrated that tumor
volume and weight in the GDF15 overexpression group
were signiﬁcantly higher than that of the control group
(Figure  5B), and GDF15 overexpression significantly
increased the lung metastasis of SK-SCs (Figure 5C–5E).
Overall, these findings suggest that GDF15 promotes
LCSC growth and metastasis.

several intracellular signaling pathways were measured
in GDF15 overexpression or GDF15 knockdown SCs.
As a TGF-β superfamily member, the GDF15 receptor
is still relatively unknown today. Therefore, to confirm
whether it could activate the TGF-β signal pathway, we
detected the expression of Smad1, Smad2 and Smad5 in
GDF15-overexpressing SK-SCs. The results showed that
the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5 and Smad2 were
not altered by GDF15 (Figure 6A). The total protein and
phosphorylated-Smad3 levels were not detectable in SKSCs (data not shown).
However, we found that GDF15 knockdown
significantly decreased the protein levels of p-AKT,
p-GSK-3β and β-catenin in three groups of SCs and
inhibited the expression of downstream molecules,
such as cyclinD1, c-Myc, TCF4, MMP-2, MMP-7 and
MMP-9 (Figure 6B). To further determine nuclear and
cytoplasmic β-catenin levels in GDF15 knockdown
SCs, we performed immunofluorescence (IFC) assay.
The results showed that GDF15 knockdown decreased
β-catenin expression (Figure 6C). These results indicate
that the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway is associated
with inhibition  of SC proliferation and metastasis  by
GDF15 knockdown.

are commonly considered as the LCSC markers4, the
expression of these factors was in a very low level in the
isolated SCs. Based on these results, we speculate that the
CSC phenotype may be different in each HCC subtype,
possibly due to the heterogeneity of activated signaling
pathways in normal stem cells where these cancer stem
cells could originate. The expression patterns of various
CSC markers may represent a subset of LCSCs. Therefore,
our studies demonstrate that CD13+CD44+ SCs may
represent a subset of LCSCs and display the capacity for
promoting tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.
Recent findings suggest that LCSCs initiate
and maintain HCC growth and translocation from the
primary tumor to distant tissues, leading to new tumors
[17]. However, the underlying biological mechanism
of LCSCs in HCC recurrence and metastasis is unclear.
According to the results of cytokine antibody array, we
found that GDF15 expression was significantly increased
in SCs. In addition, GDF15 was overexpressed in a part of
HCC patients and was positively related to pathological
grading of HCC. GDF15 is a member of the TGF-β
superfamily. GDF15 is not only involved in cancer
development, progression, angiogenesis and metastasis,
but also controls embryonic, osteogenic and hematopoietic
development, stress responses, adipose tissue function
and cardiovascular diseases [18]. So  far, few studies
have elucidated the relationship between GDF15 and
hepatocarcinoma. Especially, the biological significance
of GDF15 in LCSC properties and HCC pathogenesis
remains uncertain. Researchers investigated the effect of
GDF15 loss in vivo on hepatocellular carcinogenesis and
found that genetic ablation of GDF15 had no apparent
effect on the tumor formation, growth or invasiveness in
a diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC mouse model [19].
However, our results indicated that GDF15 knockdown
suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of
SCs in vitro and attenuated SCs tumorigenesis in vivo,
suggesting that GDF15 enhanced tumorigenicity in SCs.
Our results also demonstrated that GDF15 knockdown
inhibited the invasive and metastatic properties of SCs,
whereas GDF15 overexpression promoted SC metastatic
capability. These results were consistent with previous
reports which indicated that GDF15 overexpression
enhanced the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cell
line Huh7.5.1 [20] and human breast cancer cell line
SK-BR-3 [21]. These findings suggest that GDF15
contributes to the carcinogenesis of HCC and promotes
the growth and metastasis of LCSCs. Moreover, these
opposite effects of GDF15 on HCC progression may be
dependent on the stage and type of HCC.
The receptor and signaling pathways of GDF15 have
not been unequivocally identified, although several of its
biological functions have already been described. Several
studies have suggested that GDF15 might mediate certain
cellular responses through a Smad-dependent pathway or
a Smad-independent pathway. It had been reported that

DISCUSSION
LCSCs are a small subpopulation in liver cancer,
have been proposed to be cancer-initiating cells, and
have a stronger migration ability and tumorigenicity
that is responsible for chemotherapy resistance, cancer
metastasis and recurrence. These findings indicate that
liver cancer therapies may simply kill a majority of
tumor cells without eradication of LCSCs, and the key
to improving the curative effect of treatments for liver
cancer is the eradication of LCSCs. Therefore, to achieve
better understanding and targeting of LCSCs, we must
further discover LCSC biomarkers and clarify cellular
and signaling functions of LCSCs. In the present study,
we attempted to isolate liver cancer stem-like cells derived
from clinical HCC samples and hepatocarcinoma cell lines
using sphere-forming culture. Cells growing under sphereforming conditions show increased viability, suggesting
stem cell characteristics of CSCs. We successfully
established and cultured three groups of SCs from two
HCC samples and SK-Hep-1 cells. All three groups of SCs
exhibited the CSC-like properties of high tumorigenicity,
high metastasis and strong resistance to chemotherapy.
Although many surface markers have been reported
for LCSCs, such as CD13, CD44, CD133 and EpCAM,
there is still unified standard [13]. LCSC surface markers
need to constantly being discovered, and their sensitivity
and specificity require further study. In the present study,
our results revealed that SCs derived from two human
HCC samples and SK-Hep-1 cells, were characterized by
co-expression of CD13 and CD44. CD13, a membranebound zinc-dependent type II exopeptidase, is highly
expressed in many tumor cells and plays a crucial
role in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis.
Haraguchi et al. [14] indicated that CD13 was a marker
for semiquiescent CSCs in human liver cancer cell lines
and clinical samples and that targeting these cells might
provide a way to treat HCC. Meanwhile, CD44 is also
an important marker in HCC. CD44 and other markers
were reported to more accurately define the phenotype of
LCSCs [15, 16]. In agreement with these previous reports,
our findings suggest that CD13+CD44+ may be a specific
marker of these SCs. Although CD133 and EpCAM

GDF15 stimulated ovarian cancer cell growth and invasion
through AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling [22]. A recent
study indicated that GDF15 promoted EMT and metastasis
in colorectal cancer through binding to the TGF-β receptor
to activate Smad2 and Smad3 pathways [23]. In the
current study, we did not find that Smad signaling was
activated by GDF15 in SK-SCs, suggesting that GDF15mediated growth and metastasis might be TGF-β receptorindependent, at least for SK-SCs.
However, we next identified phosphorylated AKT
as the downstream component of GDF15-mediated
signaling in SCs. The contribution of the AKT pathway to
HCC growth and metastasis has been extensively studied
[24, 25]. Our data indicated that GDF15 induced AKT
phosphorylation in SCs, which was consistent with the
observation from Kim et al [26], who found that GDF15
activated AKT signaling in human breast and gastric
cancer. The aberrant Wnt pathway is critically important
in CSC biology. The interaction between the two pathways
through the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin axis is found to
participate in the maintenance of CSC properties [27, 28].
In the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, GSK3β plays an important role in β-catenin phosphorylation
and degradation. GSK-3β activity can be inhibited by AKT
phosphorylation at Ser9 and β-catenin transfers into the
nucleus to activate the transcription of downstream target
oncogenes such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, MMP-2 and MMP- 7.
In our study, GDF15 knockdown reduced β-catenin levels
through AKT/GSK-3β signaling suppression, and inhibited
the expression of β-catenin-responsive cyclinD1, c-Myc,
TCF4, MMP-2, MMP- 7 and MMP-9 genes, resulting in
the suppression of LCSC properties. Moreover, a PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 significantly inhibited AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling activated by GDF15 and attenuated
GDF15-induced proliferation, colony formation and
invasion of SCs. The current studies suggest that the
molecular mechanism of inducing proliferation and
metastasis by GDF15 may depend on the activation of the
AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.
In conclusion, CD13+CD44+ SCs may represent a
subset of LCSCs, which exhibit a strong CSC-like potential
for tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our studies highlight a
novel mechanism suggesting that GDF15 may promote the
growth and metastasis of SCs by activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. This work is of particular significance
in suggesting that GDF15-AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling
is a novel mechanism driving LCSC growth and metastasis.
GDF15-targeted approaches should be further investigated
as potential therapeutic strategies for HCC.

were trypsinized and cultured in SFM. Morphological
changes in the tumor cells were observed under an inverted
light microscope.

SK-SCs and SK-Hep-1 Cells were seeded in
100 mm culture dishes and incubated for 48 hours. Cell
culture supernatants were analyzed for protein expression
using a RayBio® L-Series Human Antibody Array 1000
Glass Slide Kit (RayBiotech, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The images were captured
using an Axon GenePix laser scanner.

Cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis and
drug sensitivity assay
Cell proliferation was measured by BrdU assay
(Millipore, USA). For cell cycle analysis, after fixation
in 70% ethanol, cells were incubated in PI/RNase (BD
Biosciences, USA), and analyzed using an Accuri C6
flow cytometer and ModFit LT software (BD Biosciences,
USA). For drug sensitivity assay, cells were treated with

ADM (sigma, USA) for 48 hours. MTS reagent (Sigma,
USA) was added to each well following the manufacturer’s
instructions to determine drug sensitivity.

ELISA
Human GDF15 immunoassay (R&D systems, USA)
was conducted according to the manufacture’s directions.
Optical density was determined using a microplate
reader set to 450 nm. The concentrations were calculated
according to the standards.

Plasmids and GDF15 transfection

Colony formation assay

The GDF15 shRNA target sequence was
5ʹ-TCTCAGATGCTCCTGGTGTTG-3ʹ. A lentiviral
pSUPER-GFP vector was purchased from OligoEngine
(USA). Lentiviral helper plasmids (PMDL, VSVG and
RSV-REV) were obtained from Addgene (Biovector Inc,
USA). GDF15-overexpressing lentivirus was obtained
from Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd. Virus supernatant
was incubated on target cells for 12 hours with 5 μg/ml
polybrene, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Infected cells were selected in puromycin, as optimized
for each cell line.

Cells were suspended in an appropriate medium
with 0.3% agarose and plated in 12-well plates covered
with suspension medium supplemented with 0.5%
agarose, at a density of 500 cells per well. After 2 weeks,
colonies were dyed with MTT (Sigma, USA) and counted
under the microscope.

Invasion assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells into
the upper chamber of each insert coated with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, USA). The medium containing 20% FBS was
added to the lower chambers as a chemoattractant. After
incubation for 48 hours, cells invading the lower surface
of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with crystal violet. Cell numbers were counted in
three random fields per filter.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA). Total RNA (2 μg) was used for the
synthesis of first-strand cDNA using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, China). Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed using the SYBR green mix (Applied
Biosystems, USA). The reactions were performed with a
7900 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The data were displayed as 2–ΔCt values and were
representative of at least three independent experiments.
Specific primers for the amplification of target genes and
β-actin, a housekeeping gene, are listed in Supplementary
Table 1.

In vivo tumorigenicity and lung metastasis
Five-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were
purchased from the Animal Institute of Peking Union
Medical College. In vivo tumorigenicity experiments were
conducted by injecting various cells subcutaneously into
NOD/SCID mice. The experiments were terminated when
tumor nodules were identified on the body surface of mice.
In vivo models of lung metastasis were created by injecting
the transducing cells with lentiviral vectors expressing
luciferase into NOD/SCID mice via the tail vein. Lung
metastatic colonization was monitored and quantified at
different weeks with bioluminescence imaging using an
IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA), and validated at the endpoint by
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Procedures in these
experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Tianjin Medical University.
