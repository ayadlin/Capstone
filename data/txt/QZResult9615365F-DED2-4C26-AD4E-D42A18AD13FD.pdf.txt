Abstract

Author Manuscript

Hec1 (Highly Expressed in Cancer 1) or Nek2 (NIMA-related kinase 2) is often overexpressed in
cancers with poor prognosis. Both are critical mitotic regulators and phosphorylation of Hec1
S165 by Nek2 is required for proper chromosome segregation. Therefore, inactivation of Hec1 and
Nek2 by targeting their interaction with small molecules represents an ideal strategy for tackling
these types of cancers. Here, we showed that new derivatives of INH (Inhibitor for Nek2 and Hec1
binding) bind to Hec1 at amino acids 394–408 on W395, L399 and K400 residues, effectively
blocking Hec1 phosphorylation on S165 by Nek2, and killing cancer cells at the nanomolar range.
Mechanistically, the D-box (destruction-box) region of Nek2 specifically binds to Hec1 at amino
acids 408–422, immediately adjacent to the INH binding motif. Subsequent binding of Nek2 to
INH-bound Hec1 triggered proteasome-mediated Nek2 degradation, whereas the Hec1 binding
defective Nek2 mutant, Nek2 R361L, resisted INH-induced Nek2 degradation. This finding
unveils a novel drug-action mechanism where the binding of INHs to Hec1 forms a virtual deathtrap to trigger Nek2 degradation and eventually cell death. Furthermore, analysis of the gene
expression profiles of breast cancer patient samples revealed that co-elevated expressions of Hec1
and Nek2 correlated with the shortest survival. Treatment of mice with this kind of tumor with
INHs significantly suppressed tumor growth without obvious toxicity. Taken together, the new
INH derivatives are suitable for translation into clinical application.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Mitosis is a highly intricate process that depends on the precise coordination of
microtubules, kinesins, and various kinases. Together, these molecules regulate proper
spindle formation and faithful chromosome segregation in actively proliferating cells, and
are often considered promising anticancer therapeutic targets1–4. Microtubule targeting
agents, like taxanes and Vinca alkaloids, are commonly used in wide range of cancers by
inducing cell death through poisoning the spindle apparatus and inhibiting mitotic
progression5, 6. However, since microtubules are also a key component of neurons and
rapidly cycling bone-marrow cells, these spindle poisons inevitably elicit a plethora of
severe pathological side effects that include: peripheral neurotoxicity, neuropathy, and
myelosuppression5, 7. Therefore, there is a strong interest in developing chemical
compounds that selectively inhibit mitotic kinesins (Eg5/KSP and CENP-E) or mitotic
kinases (e.g., Aurora A and B) instead of microtubules. Currently, there are over forty
different anti-mitotic inhibitors in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials4, 8–10,
which indicate that targeting mitotic apparatus is a useful strategy for treating cancer.

Hec1 was originally identified as a Rb-interacting protein11, and later found to be an
essential member of Ndc80 complex along with Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc2512, 13. An early
study using a neutralizing antibody to inactivate Hec1 indicated that Hec1 is critical for
chromosome segregation11. Subsequent investigations using siRNA to deplete Hec1 further
supported the idea that Hec1 plays an important role in mitotic spindle checkpoint
control14–17. Overall, Hec1 acts as a mitotic regulator to modulate several mitotic processes,
including chromosome condensation, migration, and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
signaling1, 11, 14, 17, 18.
Hec1 overexpression has been observed in a variety of human cancers and is associated with
adverse clinical outcomes in primary breast cancers11, 19, 20. In fact, overexpression of Hec1
in a mouse model resulted in spindle checkpoint hyperactivation and tumor formation21. On
the other hand, depletion of Hec1 by virus-mediated RNAi effectively retarded tumor
growth in mouse models22, 23. Taken together, these results suggested that Hec1 is an
important therapeutic target for developing novel anticancer regimen.

Author Manuscript

Since phosphorylation of Hec1 S165 by Nek2, a mitotic regulator, is critical for Hec1
function in modulating chromosome segregation17, 24, the interaction between Hec1 and
Nek2 during mitosis represents an ideal target for developing inhibitors that specifically
disrupt this interaction. We have previously identified compounds that block the Hec1/Nek2
interaction25. In this communication, we showed that the new leading compound, INH154,
is highly potent in treating breast tumors with co-elevated expression of Hec1 and Nek2. We
also demonstrated mechanistically, the binding of INHs to Hec1 forms a virtual death-trap to
trigger Nek2 degradation and eventually cell death.

Results
Generation of new small molecules as potent Hec1 inhibitor

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In previous studies we identified a small molecule, INH1, which directly binds to Hec1 and
inhibits cancer growth with an IC50 within the 15 μM range25. To improve the drug efficacy,
we first built a molecular model of Hec1 coiled-coil region by homology modeling based on
the crystal structure of the coiled-coil protein Tropomyosin and then docked INH1 on this
structure (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1). It was noted that INH1 preferentially
interacts with the first coiled-coil region of Hec1 and the thiazole moiety of INH1 showed a
prominent stacking interaction with the indole moiety of Hec1 W395, which may
significantly contribute to the binding with Hec1. Based on this docking model, an
additional contact site consisting mainly of Hec1 residues, N396, L399, K400, and R403,
was revealed (indicated by an arrow in Figure 1a). To explore the potential chemical
substituents that can geometrically occupy this new site, we designed a structurally focused
chemical library and prepared these compounds following a diversity-oriented synthetic
scheme26. Using this library, we identified INH41 as the lead compound of the second
generation INH, which had IC50 in sub-μM range (Table 1). Third generation of INH
derivatives were generated based on INH41. Among these compounds, INH154 was the
most potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth (Table 1). The IC50 values of INH154 in HeLa
and MDA-MB-468 cancer cells were 0.20 and 0.12 μM, respectively. In addition, both
INH41 and INH154 suppressed the growth of leukemia, osteosarcoma, and glioblastoma
cells, but had no significant growth inhibitory effects on non-tumorigenic fibroblast, HS27
and mammary epithelial cell, MCF10A (Figure 1b). The inactive INH2225 had no growth
inhibition effect on either tumor cells or normal cells (Figure 1b). Colony formation analysis
further confirmed that INH41 and INH154 effectively inhibited cancer cell growth in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1c, 1d).
INH41 and INH154 trigger mitotic catastrophe

Author Manuscript

Since inactivation of Hec1 or Nek2 was reported to trigger mitotic abnormalities, especially
spindle configuration changes and chromosome misalignment14, 15, 17, 27–29, we then tested
whether INH41 or INH154 treatment would elicit a similar cellular phenotype. In contrast to
control DMSO treatment, cells displayed increased chromosomal misalignment after 24 hrs
of treatment with INH41 or INH154 (Figure 2a and 2b). Consistently, multipolar spindle
configurations in the mitotic population were aggravated in a time-dependent manner after
INH41 or INH154 treatment (Figure 2c and 2d). Over time, the accumulation of
chromosomal and spindle abnormalities led to cell death. To determine whether mitotic
abnormalities induced by INH41 or INH154 leads to apoptosis and necrosis30, we performed
flow cytometry with Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide (PI) staining31. The percentages of
apoptotic and necrotic cells were higher in the INH41 or INH154-treated cells (17.4%, 9.5%
and 67.6%, 14.7% respectively), compared to 1.8%, 0.4% in DMSO-treated cells and 1.9%,
1.1% in INH22-treated cells (Figure 2e). Together, these results suggested that INH41 and
INH154 cause mitotic catastrophe leading to cell death.

Determining the INH-binding specificity on Hec1

Author Manuscript

To determine the region of Hec1 that mediates the binding to INH 41 and INH154, we
created a series of deletion mutants in the Hec1 coiled-coil 1 region32 and performed pulldown assays using biotin-conjugated INHs (Figure 3a and 3b). As shown in Figure 3b,
biotin-conjugated INH41 was able to pull down all Hec1 deletion mutants except ΔL394I408, suggesting that INH41 may directly bind to L394-I408 of Hec1. In contrast, biotinconjugated negative compound, INH22, failed to pull down even WT Hec1. Furthermore,
neither Nek2 nor the binding partner of Hec1, Nuf2, was pulled-down with INH41 (Figure
3b), indicating that INH preferentially bound to Hec1 instead of Nek2 or Nuf2.

Author Manuscript

Based on molecular docking, it was noted that INH41 and INH154 formed prominent
contact points with Hec1 W395, L399 and K400 (Figure 3c). To validate the importance of
these residues in determining INH-Hec1 interaction specificity, we conducted a biotin INH
pull-down assay in cells expressing Hec1 W395A or W395A/L399A/K400A (WLK/AAA)
mutants. As shown in Figure 3d, neither biotin-INH41 nor biotin-INH154 were able to bind
either mutants or Nek2 (Figure 3d), indicating that Hec1 W395 is essential for interacting
with INHs.

Author Manuscript

Since both mutants failed to bind INHs, one would expect that the cells expressing these
mutants should acquire resistance to INH treatment. To test this possibility, we established
MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing Hec1 WT, W395A or WLK/AAA (Fig 3e) and then
treated them with INHs. As shown in Figure 3f, cells expressing either Hec1 W395A or
WLK/AAA showed significantly elevated IC50 values for INH41 and INH154. Interestingly,
expression of Hec1 triple mutant, WLK/AAA, resulted in more severe loss of growth
inhibitory effect. To exclude the possibility that drug resistance was caused by inactive Hec1
functions, we measured the mitotic index in the cells overexpressing Hec1 WT, W395A, or
WLK/AAA. Both Hec1 W395A and WLK/AAA had no effect on mitotic index compared to
Hec1 WT, even when endogenous Hec1 was depleted. This suggests that both Hec1 mutants
can maintain, at least in part, normal Hec1 function in mitosis without obvious dominantnegative effect (Supplementary Figure 2). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that
INH-Hec1 binding specificity is primarily mediated by W395, and L399 and K400 also
contribute to the interaction.
INHs promote Nek2 degradation and inhibit Hec1 phosphorylation on S165

Author Manuscript

To delineate the cellular consequences upon INHs treatment, we first examined Hec1 and
Nek2 protein levels in INH41- or INH154- treated cells. In a time course study, Nek2 level
was remarkably reduced by more than 95 % after 18 hrs of treatment with 1 μM INH41 or
INH154, while little change was observed in Hec1 expression (Figure 4a), consistent with
our previous finding25. Moreover, reduction of Nek2 expression was observed in two
additional breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231), but not non-tumorigenic
mammary cell line, MCF-10A, upon INHs treatment, suggesting INHs selectively target
cancer cells and not normal cells (Supplementary Figure 3 and 4). To explore the potential
reasons for Nek2 expression down-regulation post-INH treatment, we performed real-time
PCR analysis and observed no significant change in Nek2 mRNA level during 24 hrs of INH
treatment (Supplementary Figure 5). Since Nek2 is degraded through the proteasome

pathway at prometaphase33, we then co-treated cells with INHs and the proteasome
inhibitor, MG132, and found MG132 treatment prevented the INHs-induced degradation of
Nek2 (Figure 4b and c). However, INH treatment did not affect the stability of other mitotic
molecules including cyclin B and two mitotic kinases, Aurora A and PLK1 (Figure 4d and
Supplementary Figure 3).

Author Manuscript

Since phosphorylation of Hec1 S165 is Nek2 dependent, and has been reported to play an
important role in Hec1 function17, 24, it is likely that INHs treatment would also abolish
Hec1 S165 phosphorylation. As predicted, the phosphorylated Hec1 levels (pS165 Hec1)
were notably reduced in a time-dependent fashion upon treating cells with 1 μM INH41 or
154 for 4 to 24 hrs (Figure 4e). In addition, immunostaining using the same phosphorspecific antibody showed a dramatic diminution in Hec1 phosphorylation signal at
kinetochores after INHs treatment compared to DMSO-treated cells relative to control
antibody against ACA (red) at kinetochores (Figure 4f and 4g). Collectively, these data
suggested that INHs treatment inhibits Hec1 S165 phosphorylation by promoting
proteasome-mediated Nek2 degradation.
Binding of INHs to Hec1 forms a virtual death-trap to trigger Hec1-bound Nek2 degradation

Author Manuscript

Next, we sought to explore how Nek2 degradation is triggered upon INHs treatment. Since
both Hec1 W395A and WLK/AAA mutants exhibited resistance to INHs, it is likely that
INH treatment may not induce Nek2 degradation in cells expressing these mutants. To test
this possibility, we first performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using cells
expressing Hec1 WT, W395A or WLK/AAA, and showed that both Hec1 mutants retained
Nek2 interaction and Hec1 S165 phosphorylation (Figure 5a). Noticeably, upon INH
treatment, cells expressing either Hec1 W395A or WLK/AAA mutant failed to induce Nek2
degradation (Figure 5b and Supplementary Figure 6). These data suggested that Nek2
degradation induced by INH is dependent on INH binding to Hec1.

Author Manuscript

Next, we employed the same Hec1 deletion mutants from Figure 2b to identify which region
of Hec1 mediates the binding for Nek2. As shown in Figure 5c, the co-immunoprecipitation
experiment demonstrated that region 3 (I408-L422) in Hec1 is the major interacting domain
for Nek2, while region 2 (L394-I408) also contributed to the binding, albeit to a lesser
extent. To examine whether Hec1-Nek2 interaction is required for INH-induced Nek2
degradation, we analyzed the change of Nek2 level after INHs treatment with depletion of
endogenous Hec1 and expression of siRNA-resistant Hec1 Δ3 mutant (ΔI408-L422). As
shown in Figure 5d, Nek2 was not susceptible to INHs-induced degradation when
expressing Hec1 Δ3 mutant, suggesting direct interaction between Hec1 and Nek2 is
required for Nek2 degradation upon INH treatment.
To further verify the importance of Hec1-Nek2 interaction on INHs-induced Nek2
degradation, we needed a Nek2 mutant that failed to bind to Hec1. Hot-spot analysis of
protein-protein interaction implicated that the residues within the D-box region of Nek2 may
serve as a primary contact site for Hec1 binding (Supplementary Figure 7 and
Supplementary Table 1). To test this possibility, we generated a D-box deletion mutant of
Nek2A and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Figure 5e, the
Nek2A D-box deletion mutant failed to bind to Hec1, whereas Nek2A WT was able to be

co-immunopreciptiated with Hec1. To further pinpoint which residue within the Nek2A Dbox region was critical for binding to Hec1, we performed Optimal Docking Area (ODA)
analysis and found that Nek2A R361 appeared to be the best candidate according to the
ODA value (Supplementary Table 1). We then generated a Nek2A mutant, R361L, and
showed that it failed to bind to Hec1 by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 5f).
Consistently, similar to Hec1 Δ3 mutant, Nek2A R361L was more resistant to INH154induced degradation than WT Nek2A in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 5g-j).
These results suggested that binding of Nek2 to Hec1 is a prerequisite for INH-induced
Nek2 degradation.

Author Manuscript

Based on the above data, we proposed a potential mechanism to explain this observation. As
described in Figure 5k and l, first, Nek2 normally binds to Hec1 and phosphorylates Hec1
on S165 at M phase in cells (k). Second, since the binding site of INHs to Hec1 is adjacent
to Nek2 binding hot-spot site, it is likely that INH-bound Hec1 alters Hec1-bound Nek2
conformation, leading to proteasome-mediated Nek2 degradation and reduction of Hec1
S165 phosphorylation (l). Although the precise conformational change of this transient state
of Nek2 remains to be established, the explanation described herein represents the most
logical deductions.
Co-elevated expressions of Hec1 and Nek2 are associated with the poorest survival in
breast cancer patients and INHs effectively ablate this kind of tumor progression in a
xenograft model

Author Manuscript

It was reported that up-regulation of Hec1 or Nek2 in breast cancer correlated with tumor
initiation and progression20, 34–36. To investigate whether this up-regulation is associated
with patient prognosis, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of patient samples from
publicly available microarray databases (Supplementary Table 2). The dataset was
assembled using R/Bioconductor37, containing 2851 clinically annotated samples after
outlier and duplicate sample removal. Our analysis showed that the Pearson correlation
coefficient between Hec1 and Nek2 expression levels is 0.67 (p < 0.001) among the 2851
samples, suggesting that Hec1 and Nek2 expression levels are highly associated (Figure 6a).
Using a Kaplan-Meier (KM) Cox model, we analyzed the 10-year censored distant
metastasis free survival (DMFS, n=2435) and relapse free survival (RFS, n=1056)
probabilities of samples with Hec1 and Nek2 expression levels dichotomized at their
respective median values. We found that patients with high levels of both Hec1 and Nek2
have the worst survival probability in both DMFS and RFS (Figure 6b and 6c). These results
conform the concept that targeting both Hec1 and Nek2 by INH offers a useful strategy in
treating human breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

To further address this possibility, we used a serial of human breast cell lines to perform
Western blot analysis and INH sensitivity assay. As Shown in Supplementary Figure 8,
Hec1 and Nek2 expressed higher levels in malignant breast cancer cells than in benign
breast cancer MCF7 cells or non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. As
expected, the cell lines with high expression levels of Hec1 and Nek2 were more sensitized
to INHs treatment. Next, we used human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells,
which expressed high levels of both Hec1 and Nek2, to test the efficacy of tumor growth in

mouse xenograft. While tumor volumes reached ~100mm3, mice were randomly divided
into 5 treatment groups and began to receive thrice-weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of
vehicle control, 10 mg/kg INH41, 50 mg/kg INH41, 5 mg/kg INH154 or 20 mg/kg INH154.
Treatment was continued for 6.5 weeks and the tumor sizes were measured. Tumor growth
rates in mice treated with INH41 or INH154 were evidently slower than those in control
animals in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6d and 6e). Furthermore, one week after the
last injections were administered, mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested for
immunohistochemistry analysis. In agreement with the tumor-growth data, the tumor
proliferation index, determined by measuring BrdU staining, was clearly reduced in residual
tumors treated with INH41 or INH154 in comparison with vehicle alone (Figure 6f). The
expression levels of Nek2 and Hec1 S165 phosphorylation were also substantially reduced
in INH41 or INH154-treated tumors than in vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 6g and 6h).
Together, these results suggest that the new INH derivatives significantly suppress tumor
growth in animals through the down-regulation of Nek2, and abolishment of Hec1 S165
phosphorylation. On the other hand, mice body weights were measured during the 6.5 weeks
treatment period and showed little difference among treated and control groups
(Supplementary Figure 9). In addition, we analyzed the toxicity of INHs by treating normal
BALB/c ByJNarl mice with high dosage of INH41 (50 mg/kg) or INH154 (20 mg/kg) and
showed no significant difference of body weights, blood chemistry, and complete blood
count (CBC) analysis among these groups of animals (Supplementary Table 3). These data
suggested that INHs treatment generates little or no toxicity.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The mitosis-specific roles of Hec1 and Nek2, and the poor clinical association of Hec1/Nek2
overexpression with human breast cancers, make the Hec1 and Nek2 interaction an ideal
target for cancer therapy. In this communication, we demonstrated that the novel INH
derivatives, INH41 and INH154, which directly bind to Hec1, trigger degradation of Hec1bound Nek2 at mitosis, impair Hec1 S165 phosphorylation, and induce mitotic catastrophe
and eventual cell death. Furthermore, we found that co-elevated expression of both Hec1
and Nek2 correlated with the shortest survival in breast cancer patients and treatment with
INHs effectively ablates this kind of tumor growth in a xenograft model with little or no
toxicity. Thus, these compounds are suitable for translation into clinical application.

Author Manuscript

Compared to the first generation compound, INH1, our new lead compounds, INH41 and
INH154, are about 20-fold or 100-fold more potent, respectively. We have previously
demonstrated that the isonicotinoyl and the thiazole moeities are both essential for INH
activity26. The isonicotinoyl moeity is apparently involved in weak to moderate hydrogen
bonds with E388 and Q392 (the distance between the pyridine nitrogen and E388 carboxyl
oxygens is 4.0–4.3 Å; while the distance between the isonicotinoyl oxygen and Q392
nitrogen/oxygen atom is 3.2–4.6 Å. In addition to its hydrophobic nature, the indole side
chain of W395 serves as a versatile π-donor38 to electronically interact with the thiazole ring
of INHs (the distance between the indole and thiazole rings in the INH154-Hec1 docking
models is 3.0-3.7 Å. Guided by the docking model, more interaction points were secured to
successfully increase the potency of this series of INH compounds. Particularly in INH154,
the extended piperidine side chain apparently provides additional hydrophobic interactions

with the side chains of residues L399 and K400. The distances between piperidine nitrogen
of INH154 and the polar atoms of N396/K400/R403 side chains are in the range of 5-7 Å in
a rigid model. Considering possible side chain flexibility, the lone electron pair on this
nitrogen of INH154 may serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor for donors from either one of
the three Hec1 side chains. This is partly supported by the fact that amide analogues
(INH146 and INH160) are generally less potent than amino/ether analogues (INH57,
INH79, INH81, INH130, INH154, INH158, INH212). Further optimization based on the
structure-activity relationship is certainly warranted.

Author Manuscript

Difficulties in defining clear cut protein-protein interacting interface is one of the major
challenges for drug design of this kind39. A successful example is probably p53/MDM2
disruptors, such as nutlins and RITA, following the unveiling of the p53-MDM2 crystal
structures40–42. These compounds structurally mimic protein interfaces to disrupt
MDM2/p53 interaction, which in turn induce accumulation and reactivation of p53 in both
cancer and normal cells. However, since all these compounds act through inhibiting MDM2
to restore p53 functions, they have limitation on cells with mutated or deleted p53. In the
endeavor of seeking specific protein-protein interaction disruptors, we have taken a forward
chemical genetics approaches and identified RAD51 inactivator43 and Hec1/Nek2
disruptors25. Interestingly, disruption of RAD51-BRC interaction and RAD51
multimerization by IBR2 triggers RAD51 degradation in cancer cells through proteasome
pathway.

Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, INHs act through a completely different mechanism compared to either
MDM2/p53 disruptors or IBR2. INHs directly bind Hec1 but induce degradation of Nek2. It
is clear that this degradation is specific to Nek2, as neither Aurora A nor Plk1 was affected
(Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure 3). We have shown previously that depletion of Hec1
by siRNA without drug treatment is not sufficient for Nek2 degradation25, and expressing
INH-binding deficient Hec1 mutant in cells retarded INH-induced Nek2 degradation (Figure
5b and Supplementary Figure 6), suggesting that Nek2 degradation is specific for INHs
treatment. Importantly, the INH-induced Nek2 degradation requires direct interaction
between Hec1 and Nek2. Expressing either Nek2-binding deficient Hec1 mutants or Hec1binding deficient Nek2 mutants renders resistance to Nek2 degradation in cancer cells upon
INHs treatment (Figure 5c-j). The interaction between Hec1 and Nek2 occurs specifically at
G2-M phase24 and INH treatment retarded G2/M progression, induced Nek2 degradation
and activated apoptosis signal in cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 10). However, INH
treatment did not induce Nek2 degradation at G1/S phase (Supplementary Figure 11). These
findings indicate that targeting Hec1/Nek2 interaction by INHs triggered Nek2 degradation
through specific temporal and spatial interaction between Hec1 and Nek2 at M phase.

Author Manuscript

How INHs-Hec1 binding triggers Nek2 degradation is of interest. Since the binding site of
INHs to Hec1 is adjacent to Nek2 binding hot-spot site, it is likely that a distinct
conformational change of Nek2 may take place when it binds to INHs-bound Hec1, and
signal for Nek2 degradation. Thus, INH-bound Hec1 interface may cooperatively serve as a
“death-trap” to entice Nek2 for degradation. Consistent to this notion, Nek2A D-box R361L
mutant failed to bind Hec1 and appeared to be resistant to INHs-induced degradation. The

death-trap created by the interface of INH-bound Hec1 may provide a unique mechanism
rendering the targeted protein for proteasome degradation.
Elevated Hec1 or Nek2 levels have been detected in many types of aggressive
tumors34, 44–46 and correlated with poor prognosis as well as resistance to chemotherapy47.
Consistently, we found that the high expression levels of both Hec1 and Nek2 strongly
correlated with the shortest survivals based on the analysis of clinical breast cancer patient
data (Figure 6a, b and c). Our innovative INH41 and INH154 not only inactivate Hec1, but
also induce degradation of mitotic kinase Nek2, may emerge as powerful cancer therapeutic
for Nek2 and Hec1 overexpressing cancers.

Molecular Docking

Author Manuscript

Receptor structure of Hec1 coiled-coil region was obtained by homology modeling using
ICM Pro (Molsoft L.L.C, San Diego, CA), based on the crystal structure of the coiled-coil
protein Tropomyosin (PDB Accession No: 1C1G, see Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Figure 1). Receptor pocket was identified using the automatic pocket finder
of ICM Pro, and the largest pocket (Residues E375, Q378 - L418, R420, K431, L434, I435;
Volume = 2,492 Å3) was used for docking of small compounds. INHs structures were
generated and optimized using the Molecular Editor in ICM Pro48. Interactive docking was
performed using ICM Pro, with the default setting (thoroughness =1), and the docked
conformations with lowest energy were chosen for further analysis.
Biotin-INHs pull-down assay
Cells expressing GFP-Hec1 were lysed and subjected for sonication in Lysis 125 buffer.
Cell extract was first pre-clarified with neutravidin-resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA), and then incubated with the neutravidin-resin conjugated with compoundbiotin for 3 hrs at 4ºC. The resin was then collected, and washed with 50 resin volumes

washing buffer (Lysis 125 buffer with 0.15% trion-x-100). Finally, the proteins on resin
were eluted with 2x SDS loading buffer by boiling the resin for 10 min at 95°C heat plate.
The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

Over 80% confluent cells in 10 cm Petri dish were lysed in 1 mL Lysis 125 buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 5 mM EGTA,
0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 500 nM
Microcystin-LR, and 1x proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)) and
subjected to three liquid nitrogen freeze–thaw cycles. Lysate was pre-clarified by incubating
with Protein G Sepharose (pre-blocked with 5 % BSA/PBS for 2 hrs) for 1 hr at 4°C.
Clarified lysate was then removed from the beads and incubated with antibodies at 4°C for 2
hrs, followed by incubation of fresh Protein G Sepharose for 1 hr at 4°C.
Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 125
mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM
PMSF). The lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS–PAGE, and subjected
to Western blot analysis.
Xenograft mice studies

Author Manuscript

All mice experiments were performed under the guidelines of the University of California at
Irvine Animal Research Committee. Athymic nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan Sprague-Dawley
Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were maintained in pathogen-free conditions within the University
Laboratory Animal Resources Center at the University of California Irvine according to
approved institutional protocols. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (2 × 106) were injected
into the mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-wk-old nude mice. Once tumors reach ~100mm3, mice
were divided into 5 treatment groups (n=6 per group): vehicle control (5% DMSO, 7.5%
Ethanol, 7.5% Cremophor EL, 20% PEG400, 60% saline), 10 mg/kg INH41, 50 mg/kg
INH41, 5 mg/kg INH154 or 20 mg/kg INH154. Mice were treated with vehicle control or
INHs thrice weekly via i.p. injection. Mice body weights and tumor sizes were measured
twice weekly. Tumor volume was calculated as (length x width2)/2 (in mm), and data were
presented as mean tumor volume ± SEM.
Statistical Analyses
A two-tailed Student's t test was used to tumor growth, immunostaining analysis,
immunohistochemistry for pS165 Hec1, BrdU staining and IC50 for INH41 or INH154 in
MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing GFP-Hec1 mutants. *, ** indicate p < 0.05 and p <
0.01, respectively.

complex induces Nek2 conformational change, promotes proteasome- mediated Nek2
degradation and reduces phosphorylation of Hec1 S165 (l).
