Abstract
Radiolabeled benzamides are attractive candidates for targeted radiotherapy of metastatic melanoma as
they bind melanin and exhibit high tumor uptake and retention. One such benzamide, N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-(4-fluoro-benzamido)-5-iodo-2-methoxy-benzamide (MIP-1145), was evaluated for its ability to
distinguish melanin-expressing from amelanotic human melanoma cells, and to specifically localize to
melanin-containing tumor xenografts. The binding of [131I]MIP-1145 to melanoma cells in vitro was melanin
dependent, increased over time, and insensitive to mild acid treatment, indicating that it was retained within
cells. Cold carrier MIP-1145 did not reduce the binding, consistent with the high capacity of melanin binding of
benzamides. In human melanoma xenografts, [131I]MIP-1145 exhibited diffuse tissue distribution and washout
from all tissues except melanin-expressing tumors. Tumor uptake of 8.82% injected dose per gram (ID/g) was
seen at 4 hours postinjection and remained at 5.91% ID/g at 24 hours, with tumor/blood ratios of 25.2 and 197,
respectively. Single photon emission computed tomography imaging was consistent with tissue distribution
results. The administration of [131I]MIP-1145 at 25 MBq or 2.5 GBq/m2 in single or multiple doses significantly
reduced SK-MEL-3 tumor growth, with multiple doses resulting in tumor regression and a durable response for
over 125 days. To estimate human dosimetry, gamma camera imaging and pharmacokinetic analysis was
performed in cynomolgus monkeys. The melanin-specific binding of [131I]MIP-1145 combined with prolonged
tumor retention, the ability to significantly inhibit tumor growth, and acceptable projected human dosimetry
suggest that it may be effective as a radiotherapeutic pharmaceutical for treating patients with metastatic
malignant melanoma. Cancer Res; 70(10); 4045–53. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster
than that of any other cancer in the United States, and The
Skin Cancer Foundation estimates that ∼60,000 new cases
will be diagnosed this year. Unfortunately, the prognosis for
stage III and IV disease is poor. Currently, there is no effective treatment for melanoma metastases, and patients with
metastatic disease have a life expectancy of 4 to 6 months.
Complete surgical removal of the diseased tissue is commonly used to treat the primary tumor. However, due to
early and widespread occurrence of metastases as small
as 3 mm in diameter, surgery is often not curative, and cheAuthors' Affiliations: 1Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,

motherapeutic options are limited with poor response rates.
Current Food and Drug Administration–approved treatments for stage IV melanoma include dacarbazine, with
an objective response rate of 16% (1), and high-dose bolus
interleukin 2 (IL-2; proleukin), also with an objective response rate of 16% (2). High-dose interferon α-2b (intron
A) is approved for high-risk stage II and III melanoma
and has an objective response rate of 14% in stage IV disease (3). The combination of IL-2 and interferon α-2b occasionally produces relatively long durations of response but
do not benefit enough patients to improve median survival
substantially; in addition, these agents are associated with
significant toxicity (4–7). The poor response rates with
these regimens suggest a large unmet need for effective
treatments for patients with metastatic melanoma.
The vast majority of melanomas contain the pigment melanin (8), which is produced within cells during the metabolism of tyrosine. Melanin is found in all pigmented regions of
the body, including the skin, hair, and eyes, and is also found
in the inner ear and in regions of the brain, specifically within the substantia nigra (9, 10). Melanins are biopolymers
containing indole units with carboxyl functionalities and
phenolic hydroxy groups (11), which seem to have multiple
homeostatic and protective functions. In the skin, melanin

protects against the harmful effects of UV radiation, and melanogenesis is stimulated by DNA damage caused by UV
rays. In addition, melanin plays a role in absorbing heat. Importantly, organic amines, metals, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons are capable of binding melanin in normal
and malignant tissues (12). Drug-melanin associations involve a complex array of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic
and ionic interactions, and both cooperative and anticooperative binding (13, 14). However, those interactions have
not been fully characterized, partly because melanins are
not well-defined chemical entities but are rather mixtures
of polymers with nonhydrolyzable bonds. The physiologic
significance of compound binding to normal melanotic tissue is not clear. Although it may lead to the removal of
harmful substances from the body (15), it could potentially
have detrimental effects as it sequesters toxic or carcinogenic
chemicals (9, 12, 14).
Radiolabeled benzamide derivatives are known to bind
melanin and exhibit high uptake and retention in melanoma cells and in mice bearing melanoma tumors (16–21),
making them potentially effective agents for detecting melanoma in patients and for delivery of therapeutic isotopes.
For the last 20 years, efforts have focused on the development of melanin-localizing benzamides that exhibit rapid
washout from nontarget tissues and prolonged tumor retention for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here, we
describe the preclinical evaluation of N-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)4-(4-fluoro-benzamido)-5-iodo-2-methoxy-benzamide (MIP1145), an 131I-labeled small-molecule benzamide that may
be effective for therapeutic targeting of melanin-positive
melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Radiolabeling of [131I]MIP-1145 and [123I]MIP-1145.
N-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-4-(4-fluoro-benzamido)-2-methoxybenzamide (MIP-1145 precursor, 80 μg) dissolved in acetic
acid was added to thallium trifluoroacetate, Tl(TFA)3, in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in a molar ratio of 1:1.2. The solution
was brought to a final volume of 0.3 mL (50% acetic acid, 50%
TFA). After a 10-minute incubation at room temperature, 2.2
GBq of Na131I [or Na123I for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)] in
10 to 20 μL of 0.1 N NaOH was added and incubated at room
temperature for an additional 5 minutes. The crude reaction
was diluted in formulation buffer [6% PEG-400, 2% ethanol,
6% ascorbic acid, and 3% sodium gentisate (pH 4.4)] then purified/analyzed on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18, 4.6 × 100 mm,
5 μm reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) column. The column was eluted with a gradient of 25% to 60% buffer B over 10 minutes at a flow rate of
2 mL/min using 2.5% ascorbic acid (w/v)/0.5% acetic acid (v/v)
in water (buffer A) and 2.5% ascorbic acid (w/v)/85% ethanol
(v/v) in water (buffer B) as solvents. The product peak was
collected and diluted in formulation buffer to a final concentration of 1.48 MBq/mL. The solution was filtered through
a sterile Millipore Millex GV 33 mm, 0.2 μm syringe filter to

yield the final product with a radiochemical purity of >95%
and a specific activity as high as 55.5 TBq/mmol.
Cell culture. The human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-3
and the human amelanotic melanoma cell line A375 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. A375 cells
were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). SK-MEL-3 cells were maintained in
McCoy's 5a (modified) medium (Invitrogen) containing 15%
FBS. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C/
5% CO2. Cells were passaged by washing in Dulbecco's PBS
(D-PBS; Invitrogen) and incubating at 37°C with 0.25%
trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen).
Binding of [ 131I]MIP-1145 to cells. Cells were plated
in Costar 96-well culture plates (50,000 cells per well for
SK-MEL-3 and 25,000 cells per well for A375) and allowed
to attach overnight. Due to differences in growth rate, plating
cells at these densities resulted in both cell lines reaching
confluence by the following morning, allowing for a straightforward comparison. To examine the time course of [131I]
MIP-1145 uptake, cells were incubated for various times up
to 6 hours with 11.5 nmol/L [131I]MIP-1145 (∼9 × 105 cpm/
well) in DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA).
At the indicated time, the medium was removed and cells
were washed once with DMEM/0.5% BSA. Cells were
then washed with a mild acid buffer [50 mmol/L glycine,
150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 3.0)] at 4°C for 5 minutes. The buffer
was collected and cells were washed once with DMEM/0.5%
BSA. Pooled washes (containing cell surface–bound [131I]
MIP-1145) were counted on a Wallac 1282 automated gamma counter. The culture plate (containing cells with internalized [131I]MIP-1145) was counted on a Wallac 1450 Trilux
Microbeta liquid scintillation counter. Counts on both instruments were calibrated to a standard. For competitive binding
analysis, cells were incubated for 2 hours with 3.6 nmol/L
[131I]MIP-1145 in the presence of 1.6 to 1,600 nmol/L nonradiolabeled MIP-1145. All plates were washed twice with
DMEM/0.5% BSA containing 50 mmol/L HEPES buffer,
150 μL of scintillation fluid was added per well, and plates
were counted on a liquid scintillation counter.
Tissue distribution of [ 131 I]MIP-1145. Male athymic
NCrnu/nu mice (Taconic) were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of 9.5 mg/mouse avertin. SK-MEL-3 and A375 cells
were resuspended at 8 × 106 cells/mL in a 1:1 mixture of
D-PBS containing 1 g/L D-glucose and 36 mg/L L-sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen) and Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Each
mouse was injected in the right hind flank with 0.25 mL
of the cell suspension. Mice were used for tissue distribution studies when the tumors reached 100 to 500 mm3
(∼21 days postinoculation).
A quantitative analysis of the tissue distribution of [131I]
MIP-1145 was done in separate groups of male NCrnu/nu mice
bearing SK-MEL-3 or A375 xenografts. [131I]MIP-1145 was administered through the tail vein as a bolus injection of ∼74
kBq in a constant volume of 0.05 mL. Mice (n = 5/time point)
were euthanized by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide at 1, 4,
and 24 hours postinjection. Tissues [blood, heart, lungs, liver,
spleen, kidneys, stomach (with contents), large and small

SPECT imaging. Athymic nude mice were implanted with
5 × 106 SK-MEL-3 or A375 cells. When the tumors reached 100
to 500 mm3, mice were anesthetized using 1% isoflurane gas in
oxygen flowing at 0.6 L/min before and during radiopharmaceutical injection. Mice were injected through the tail vein with
37 MBq [123I]MIP-1145 and imaged at 1, 4, and 24 hours postinjection with a Gamma Medica X-SPECT scanner equipped
with two medium-energy collimators with a radius-of-rotation
of 9 cm. The tomographic data were acquired in 64 projections
over 360° at 40 seconds per projection. Following tomography,
CT imaging was acquired in 512 projections to allow anatomic coregistration. Data were reconstructed using the twodimensional ordered subsets–expectation maximization
algorithm. Volume rendered images were generated using
Amira 5.2.0 software (Visage Imaging).
Effect of [131I]MIP-1145 on SK-MEL-3 growth. Six-weekold female athymic nude mice (Charles River Laboratories)
were inoculated s.c. with human melanoma SK-MEL-3 cells
(3 × 106) into the right hind flank. When tumors reached an
average volume of ∼100 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (n = 10 mice per
group), which included saline, [131I]MIP-1145 at 25 MBq or
2.5 GBq/m 2 single dose, [ 131 I]MIP-1145 once weekly for
2 weeks, and [131I]MIP-1145 once weekly for 3 weeks. Each
animal was administered the test article i.p. in a volume of
0.1 mL. Tumor dimensions were measured twice weekly with
digital calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated with the
formula (width2 × length)/2. Mice were followed until tumor
volumes in the vehicle group reached the maximum allowed
by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
guidelines (1,500 mm3). To monitor potential toxicity, body
weight was measured daily and animals were scored for signs
of distress using standard guidelines (22).
Dosimetry in cynomolgus monkeys. Four cynomolgus
monkeys (2 females and 2 males) anesthetized with Telazol
received an i.v. dose of 185 MBq [131I]MIP-1145 without thyroid blockade. Serial anterior/posterior imaging was performed on a Siemens dual-head E-cam gamma camera.
The duration of acquisition was adjusted to achieve adequate
organ count density. Blood sampling was performed at 5, 30,
60, 120, and 360 minutes and at 24, 48, and 72 hours postinjection. Urine was collected from all animals through the
72-hour time point at the following collection intervals:
0 to 6, 6 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72 hours postinjection.
The pharmacokinetics of [131I]MIP-1145 was analyzed by
WinNonlin 4.1 (Pharsight). The blood and tissue concentration-time data were computed by a noncompartment
method, and pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum concentration, Cmax; area under curve, AUC; mean residence
time, MRT) were generated. Total clearance (CL) was calculated as CL = dose/AUC, and steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was calculated as Vss = MRT × CL using
model 201. Regions of interest were drawn on the anterior
and posterior images over the animal's total body, lung,

www.aacrjournals.org

kidney, thyroid, and eye regions at each time point (where
these regions were visible). Total organ uptake was normalized to a percentage of the total body dose where the
amount of retention at the first image (before voiding)
was 100%. Time integrals of whole body and target organ
retention were entered into OLINDA/EXM software (23).
The adult male human phantom model was used with a
4.8-hour voiding interval for the urinary bladder. The
OLINDA/EXM unit density sphere model was used to estimate average dose to the eye.

Results
Radiolabeling of [131I]MIP-1145. The structure of MIP1145 is shown in Fig. 1. MIP-1145 was readily radiolabeled
with 131I or 123I through Tl(TFA)3, starting with the precursor,
N-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-4-(4-fluoro-benzamido)-2-methoxybenzamide. The crude reaction solution was purified by
RP-HPLC, and the product was collected in radiolysisstabilizing medium [6% ascorbic acid and 3% sodium
gentisate (pH 4.5)]. Typically, a radiochemical yield of 70%
to 90% with a radiochemical purity of >95% for the final
product was obtained. [131I]MIP-1145 was stable in both
saline and rat plasma (>94%) at 37°C for at least 24 hours.
[131I]MIP-1145 binds specifically to melanotic cells and
is internalized. To examine the binding of [131I]MIP-1145 to
melanotic SK-MEL-3 cells and amelanotic A375 cells, confluent cultures were incubated with [131I]MIP-1145 for various
times up to 6 hours, and washed with either medium or a
mild acid solution to remove the compound that is bound
to the cell surface. Figure 2A depicts the total binding of
[131I]MIP-1145 and the acid-insensitive binding or internalized compound in SK-MEL-3 and A375 cells. Total binding
was approximately twice as great for the SK-MEL-3 cells
compared with the A375 cells. These results show a timedependent, acid-insensitive increase in radioactivity associated
with the cellular pellet of SK-MEL-3, but not with A375 cells.
After 6 hours, approximately 43% of the total MIP-1145
added to the SK-MEL-3 cells were cell associated, whereas
only ∼13% of MIP-1145 were associated with A375 cells, indicating that MIP-1145 is preferentially retained within the
melanin-expressing SK-MEL-3 cells. A competitive binding
assay was performed to evaluate the ability of nonradiolabeled MIP-1145 to compete with [131I]MIP-1145 for binding
to melanin in SK-MEL-3 and A375 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B,

[131I]MIP-1145 bound to a much greater extent to SK-MEL-3
cells compared with A375 cells. Importantly, there was very
little competition by nonradiolabeled MIP-1145 for binding,
up to the maximum concentration tested of 1.6 μmol/L.
These data suggest a high-capacity binding of MIP-1145 to
melanin such that high specific radioactivity is not necessary
for effective melanoma uptake.
[131I]MIP-1145 localizes to melanotic tissues. The tissue
distribution of [131I]MIP-1145 was assessed in NCrnu/nu mice
bearing SK-MEL-3 or A375 xenografts (Table 1). At 1 hour,
[131I]MIP-1145 exhibited diffuse tissue distribution with the
greatest uptake in the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and
liver, demonstrating that [131I]MIP-1145 clears through both
renal and hepatobiliary routes. By 4 hours, all nontarget and
nonexcretory tissues had begun to clear, while uptake in the
SK-MEL-3 tumors, but not the A375 tumors, had increased.
SK-MEL-3 tumor uptake of 8.82% ID/g was detected at
4 hours postinjection and remained at 5.91% ID/g at 24 hours,
with tumor/blood ratios of 25.2 and 197, respectively. Minimal deiodination was observed as the thyroid contained <1%

4048

Cancer Res; 70(10) May 15, 2010

of the total injected dose at all time points. High uptake was
noted in the stomach. Although this is unusual, it has been
observed with compounds of this class (24). Although we
have reported high uptake of [131I]MIP-1145 in the pigmented eyes of C57BL6 mice (>30% ID/g; ref. 25), as expected,
there was very little uptake (<1% ID/g) in the unpigmented
eyes of the albino NCrnu/nu mice.
SPECT/CT imaging with [123I]MIP-1145 was consistent
with the tissue distribution results (Fig. 3). SK-MEL-3 tumors were easily discernible at all time points examined,
whereas A375 tumors were not detected. At 1 hour postinjection, diffuse tissue distribution was observed with the
greatest uptake in the tumor, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract,
and liver. By 24 hours, tumor uptake was still visualized,
along with only remnants of [ 123I]MIP-1145 detected in
the lower gastrointestinal tract.
[131I]MIP-1145 inhibits the growth of melanotic xenograft tumors and prolongs survival. To determine if [131I]
MIP-1145 has the potential to be used as a radiotherapeutic
drug, the effect of [131I]MIP-1145 treatment on tumor growth
was examined (Fig. 4A). Twenty-one days after implantation,
SK-MEL-3 tumors reached a volume of 123 ± 8 mm3, and animals were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment
groups. Saline treatment resulted in a linear growth rate over
the first 60 days of the study. During this time, the tumor size
increased >10-fold for a tumor doubling time of approximately 3 days. Several animals in the saline group either died
with tumor or had to be sacrificed when the tumor reached
the maximum allowed size by IACUC guidelines, 1,500 mm3.
A single dose of [131I]MIP-1145 at 25 MBq or 2.5 GBq/m2
resulted in a marked reduction in the rate of tumor growth.
At 35 days after a single treatment, the average tumor volume was only 2.2 times greater than the starting volume,
resulting in a reduction in tumor volume of approximately
79% compared with saline. Two doses of [131I]MIP-1145 administered 1 week apart resulted in tumor regression of 11%
at 35 days compared with the starting volume. Three doses
of [131I]MIP-1145 administered 1 week apart resulted in a
further tumor reduction at 35 days of 40% compared with
the starting volume. At 120 days after administration of
the first dose of [131I]MIP-1145, inhibition of tumor growth
was still obvious in all treatment groups, with the group that
received three doses of [131I]MIP-1145 exhibiting no significant tumor growth compared with the initial pretreatment
starting volume. [ 131 I]MIP-1145 treatment resulted in a
dose-dependent increase in survival. By day 120, 90% of
the animals in the saline group either died with tumor or
had to be sacrificed (Fig. 4B). In contrast, 60% of the onedose [131I]MIP-1145 group, 90% of the two-dose [131I]MIP1145 group, and 100% of the three-dose [131I]MIP-1145 group
survived the 120-day course of the experiment. No significant
changes in body weight or signs of distress were observed
with [131I]MIP-1145 treatment, indicating minimal toxicity.
Dosimetry of [131I]MIP-1145 suggests potential use as a
therapeutic in humans. To examine dosimetry, gamma
camera imaging and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on cynomolgus monkeys injected with 185 MBq
[131I]MIP-1145. After reaching Cmax at the first time point,

I-Labeled Benzamide for Targeted Melanoma Radiotherapy

the blood concentration slowly declined with a MRT of 47 ±
5 hours. Mean blood clearance was 400 ± 45 mL/h, indicating
that [131I]MIP-1145 was slowly cleared from the vascular
compartment with a Vss of 19 ± 3.1 liters. This value is greater
than the total body water of the cynomolgus monkey, indicating that [131I]MIP-1145 was highly distributed outside the
vascular compartment. Although this study was not designed
to be a mass balance analysis, 28% of the injected dose was
recovered in the urine by 72 hours postinjection. Scintigraphic images showed that [131I]MIP-1145 was slowly cleared predominantly through the hepatobiliary route, as evidenced by
uptake in the gall bladder and gastrointestinal tract. Ocular
retention was observed beginning 24 to 48 hours postinjection. Uptake in the thyroid was also visualized beginning at
24 hours postinjection as expected because thyroid blockade
was not conducted.
Radiation dose estimates of [ 131I]MIP-1145 for human
organs were extrapolated from the cynomolgus monkey scin-

tigraphic distribution data. The results of this analysis
showed the target organs to be the thyroid, large intestine,
and eyes, which received radiation-absorbed doses of
18, 2.8/1.1 (lower/upper), and 1.3 mGy/MBq, respectively.
All other organs were predicted to receive between 0.064
and 1.1 mGy/MBq (Table 2).

Discussion
The value of radiolabeled benzamides for imaging melanoma through affinity for melanin was first realized in
1986 when iodine-labeled compounds under investigation
for brain imaging were shown to localize to the pigmented
eyes of C57BL/6 mice but not the unpigmented eyes of
Wistar albino rats (26). It was later determined that uveal
melanin mediated the uptake (26). Since these initial observations, several 123I-labeled molecules have been examined for
scintigraphic detection of malignant melanoma in patients

through melanin content (16, 17, 27). N-(2-diethylamino-ethyl
4-iodobenzamide; BZA), the first molecule to advance to
clinical trials, showed a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity
of 100% on a lesion site basis in patients with confirmed
melanoma, thereby validating the concept (28).
More recently, several laboratories have focused on the development of benzamide analogues incorporating 131I for radiotherapy (18). Na131I is commonly used to treat thyroid
cancer as it emits a high-energy (606 keV) β particle capable
of ablating the cancer and its metastases. For consideration
for radiotherapy, compounds must exhibit significant uptake
and prolonged tumor retention and rapid washout from nontarget tissues. [131I]MIP-1145 was selected as a lead from a
series of ring-substituted benzamides based on the level of
tumor uptake in vivo, chemical stability, and aqueous solubility (25). MIP-1145 retains a similar pharmacophore to BZA
and other melanin-binding benzamides, but is modified to
include a methoxy group at the 2-position and an iodine at
the 5-position of the central aromatic ring, which was used
here for radiolabeling with 131I and 123I in high radiochemical
yield and purity. In addition, MIP-1145 contains a fluorobenzoate, which could potentially be radiolabeled with 18F
for monitoring the success of radiotherapy by positron emission tomography.
[131I]MIP-1145 exhibited melanin-specific binding, washout from nontarget tissues, and prolonged tumor retention,
making it an ideal candidate for systemic radiotherapy. The
high uptake of [131I]MIP-1145 is in agreement with observa-

tions made using other radiolabeled benzamides (16–21) and
is consistent with the binding properties of the melanin polymer, which, unlike a typical receptor-ligand interaction, involves multiple types of associations resulting in the
sequestration of large amounts of material in essentially a
nonspecific, noncompetitive fashion (19). Similarly, tumor
uptake in mice bearing B16F10 xenografts was unchanged
by lowering the specific activity of the [131I]MIP-1145 by
1,000-fold from 55.5 TBq/mmol to 55.5 GBq/mmol, 10.17 ±
1.81 versus 9.28 ± 2.24% ID/g, respectively (25).
Treatment of mice bearing melanin-containing SK-MEL-3
tumors with a single dose of [131I]MIP-1145 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, with significant tumor regression at multiple doses. These tumor growth inhibition
data with [131I]MIP-1145 are notable as there are presently
very few effective treatment options for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. Future dose optimization
studies in humans are necessary to select a regimen that is
efficacious while delivering the lowest amount of radiation
possible to normal tissues to avoid potential toxicity.
As expected, there was very little uptake of [131I]MIP-1145
in the unpigmented eyes of albino NCrnu/nu mice. However,
we previously reported a high uptake of [131I]MIP-1145 in the
pigmented eyes of C57BL/6 mice (>30% ID/g; ref. 25). Therefore, it was essential to forecast the exposure to the eyes of
melanoma patients. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the
radiation dose estimates to the human eye were obtained
from monkey scintigraphic data for 131I accumulated in three

melanin-containing substructures (ciliary body, retina, and
choroid). The ocular substructure simulation predicted a
radiation-absorbed dose of 0.2 MBq-h/MBq, with the highest
radiation-absorbed dose to the ciliary body (6.8 Gy for a 3.7
GBq therapeutic dose). Using the results from external beam
data, the TD5/5 (5% incidence in 5 years) values for retinopathy and cataract induction are 45 and 10 Gy, respectively
(29). Therefore, an administered activity of 20.8 GBq would
be needed to reach the retina TD5/5 of 45 Gy for retinopathy,
and an administered activity of 7.7 GBq would be needed to
reach the lens TD5/5 of 10 Gy for cataracts. Estimates of the
human radiation dose for [131I]MIP-1145, based on an extrapolation of nonhuman primate scintigraphy and dosimetry
calculations, support the safe administration of therapeutic
doses of up to 16.2 GBq with the anticipated dose-limiting
organ being the lower large intestine. Based on the mouse
xenograft results, the anticipated efficacious human dose will
be 2.5 GBq/m2 or 4.7 GBq/70 kg patient. At this dose, the
radiation-absorbed dose to the lower large intestine will be
13.3 Gy, which is 3.3 times less than the allowable radiation
exposure limit of 45 Gy, whereas the dose to the eye is only
6.1 Gy. Based on this profile, we anticipate a sufficient

therapeutic index to warrant the study of [131I]MIP-1145 in
the treatment of stage III and stage IV melanoma. It may also
be advantageous to combine [131I]MIP-1145 with chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation-sensitizing agents, as has been
done in animal models with [131I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine,
to enhance efficacy at low doses of radiation (30–33).
Although normal melanosomes have a protective function
by virtue of their detoxification of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), these organelles in melanoma cells are deviant inasmuch as they generate free radicals (34, 35). This may be a
result of metal binding to the characteristic pigment structure (36) or a consequence of melanin biosynthesis (37).
Chronic production of oxidative stress could contribute to
the malignant transformation process (38). Conversely, the
melanoma-specific accumulation of ROS may provide a
unique therapeutic target (38), and recent evidence indicates
that the ROS-inducing drug elesclomol potentiates apoptosis
in melanoma cells through the induction of oxidative stress
(39). The sensitivity of melanoma cells to therapeutic
schemes that promote cell death through ROS production

encourages the use of ionizing radiation combined with the
specificity afforded by melanoma-selective targeting using
melanin-avid small molecules.
Radiation therapy has not commonly been used to treat
melanoma because melanoma cells in culture have traditionally been considered radiation resistant (40). Rofstad,
in assessing the effect of radiation on several human melanoma cell lines, concluded that malignant melanoma is
heterogeneous in radioresponsiveness, and therefore malignant melanomas should not be considered radiation resistant in general (41, 42). Recently, several clinical studies
have realized success using external beam radiation as a
means of palliation in patients with metastatic melanoma
(43, 44), dispelling the concept that melanoma is radiation
resistant. Although focused external radiation may be effective for local control, its use to treat widespread disease is
obviously limited. In addition, intense local irradiation can
result in significant undesirable damage to adjacent, normal tissues. Targeted radiotherapy, as exemplified here
with [131I]MIP-1145, offers the advantage of directing the
radioactive payload specifically to tumor cells through
binding to a cancer-associated molecular target, thereby
sparing nontarget tissues. This should be especially beneficial for patients with widespread metastases where conventional radiotherapy is not applicable.
Interestingly, moderate uptake of [131I]MIP-1145 was detected in the mouse brain, reaching approximately 0.6 to
0.8% ID/g, indicating that [131I]MIP-1145 crosses the bloodbrain barrier. Blood-brain barrier permeability is critical for
treating melanoma metastases to the brain. This is particularly encouraging given that the presence of brain metastases
confers a poor prognosis, and two thirds of melanoma patients die with brain metastases (45).
Alternative strategies to exploit melanin, melanogenesis,
and the interaction of benzamides with melanin for the potential treatment of melanoma have met with early, but in
some cases limited, success. In this regard, alkylating benzamides have been shown to promote tumor growth delay

in preclinical models (46), and high tumor uptake has been
observed with radiolabeled acridine-conjugated benzamides
(47). Radiolabeled analogues of α-MSH peptide have also
shown some promise in animal models (48). Furthermore,
radiolabeled antimelanin antibodies for imaging and treatment of melanoma have shown efficacy in preclinical models (49, 50). However, as melanin is intracellular, antibodies
are only expected to bind to necrotic tumor cells. In addition, the long circulating half-life of antibodies results in
enhanced nontarget tissue exposure, often limiting the dose
that can be administered. Thus, small-molecule benzamides, such as [131I]MIP-1145, which freely traverse the cell
membrane to reach the intracellular target and clear rapidly from the circulation and nontarget tissues, offer a more
effective approach.
In summary, described here is a new radiolabeled benzamide analogue, [131I]MIP-1145, which as a result of its localization to melanin-expressing tumors exhibits efficacy in
inhibiting melanoma growth in vivo. In light of the large unmet medical need, these data strongly support the advancement of [131I]MIP-1145 to clinical trials for further evaluation
as a radiotherapeutic pharmaceutical for treating patients
with malignant melanoma.
