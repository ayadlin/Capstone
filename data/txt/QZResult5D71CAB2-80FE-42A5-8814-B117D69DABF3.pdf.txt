ABSTRACT:
Oncogenic fusion proteins, such as EWS-FLI1, are excellent therapeutic targets
as they are only located within the tumor. However, there are currently no
agents targeted toward transcription factors, which are often considered to be
‘undruggable.’ A considerable body of evidence is accruing that refutes this claim
based upon the intrinsic disorder of transcription factors. Our previous studies
show that RNA Helicase A (RHA) enhances the oncogenesis of EWS-FLI1, a putative
intrinsically disordered protein. Interruption of this protein-protein complex by
small molecule inhibitors validates this interaction as a unique therapeutic target.
Single enantiomer activity from a chiral compound has been recognized as strong
evidence for specificity in a small molecule-protein interaction. Our compound,
YK-4-279, has a chiral center and can be separated into two enantiomers by chiral
HPLC. We show that there is a significant difference in activity between the two
enantiomers. (S)-YK-4-279 is able to disrupt binding between EWS-FLI1 and RHA
in an immunoprecipitation assay and blocks the transcriptional activity of EWSFLI1, while (R)-YK-4-279 cannot. Enantiospecific effects are also established in
cytotoxicity assays and caspase assays, where up to a log-fold difference is seen
between (S)-YK-4-279 and the racemic YK-4-279. Our findings indicate that only
one enantiomer of our small molecule is able to specifically target a protein-protein
interaction. This work is significant for its identification of a single enantiomer effect
upon a protein interaction suggesting that small molecule targeting of intrinsically
disordered proteins can be specific. Furthermore, proving YK-4-279 has only one
functional enantiomer will be helpful in moving this compound towards clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

cascades[1]. Many oncogenic transcription factors result
from chromosomal translocations that are unique anticancer targets. ETS family translocations occur in several
cancers, including prostate, malignant melanoma of soft
parts, myxoid liposarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell
tumors, and Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT)

Transcription factors are often considered to be
‘undruggable,’ despite being promising therapeutic
targets. Transcription factors are the driving force in
many cancers and are the “bottleneck” of many signaling

for multiple binding sites to small molecules[6]. IDPs
have already been targeted for drug discovery, such as
the kinase and phosphorylation sites located within areas
of intrinsic disorder[7]. The c-Myc oncoprotein can be
inhibited by small molecules that bind to the disordered
region of c-Myc[8, 9]. EWS-FLI1 requires disorder for
maximal transactivation of transcription[10] and the
disordered nature of the transcription factor facilitates the
protein-protein complexes that lead to oncogenesis[11].
Oncogenesis of EWS-FLI1 requires protein
partnering with RNA Helicase A (RHA), which is
necessary to enhance the transformation of EWSFLI1[12]. The purification of recombinant EWSFLI1[13] allowed for the screening of a library of small
molecules with surface plasmon resonance to identify
compounds with direct binding[14]. The small molecule
lead compound and its derivative, YK-4-279, bind to
EWS-FLI1 and are able to disrupt the EWS-FLI1/RHA
interaction. Treatment with YK-4-279 specifically inhibits
EWS-FLI1 function both in vivo and in vitro. Our small
molecule, YK-4-279, is the first molecule to directly target
EWS-FLI1.
YK-4-279 contains a chiral center. Chiral
discrimination between enantiomers is extremely
important, as stereopure drugs can often reduce the total
dose of drug given and minimize any toxicity resulting
from the inactive enantiomer[15]. Examples of specificity
of enantiomers ranges from harmless, such as estrone with
an inactive (-) form and active (+) form, to penicillamine,
which is extremely toxic when dosed in the L-form[16].
When dosed in the (R)-form, thalidomide acts as a
sedative, but treatment with the (S)-enantiomer is highly
teratogenic[17]. However, chiral inversion of thalidomide
occurs within the body, and both the (S)- and (R)-forms
are interconverted with both oral and intravenous dosing.
In 1992, the FDA revised its policy on the registration of
new drugs, and now requires separate pharmacological,
pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles for each
enantiomer in a racemic mixture[18]. As a result of these
changes requiring additional toxicology studies of racemic
compounds, single enantiomer drugs have since dominated
the pharmaceuticals approved in the United States[19].
In order to evaluate enantiospecific effects of YK4-279, we separated both enantiomers to purity and
tested each in comparison to the racemate. Our results
indicate a significant difference in activity between the
two enantiomers. These experiments clarify the activity of
YK-4-279 based upon its single enantiomer activity and
contribute to the future clinical development of YK-4-279
in an era where novel approaches to cancer therapy are
critical to improving patient care.

[2]. Ninety-five percent of ESFT cases contain a balanced
t(11;22) or t(21;22) rearrangement, combining the aminoterminus of EWS to the carboxyl-terminus of FLI1 or
ERG, both of which contain the highly conserved ets
DNA binding domain[3]. Currently, there are no clinically
available targeted agents that inhibit these unique tumorspecific proteins.
Unlike targeting an enzyme at the ATP binding site,
development of a therapeutic target for a transcription
factor requires very specific disruption of a DNA-protein
or protein-protein interaction[4]. EWS-FLI1 is predicted
to be an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which is
a protein lacking stable secondary or tertiary structures
under physiological conditions[5]. IDPs often have a great
potential for binding to small molecules due to higher
induced-fit sampling properties and have the potential

of each sample were analyzed by chemical and chiral
HPLC and mass spectrometry (MS). The HPLC results
show chemical and chiral purity of both fractions, with
chemical purity and enantiomeric excess values of >99%.
MS analyses of the enantiomers are consistent with the
structure of YK-4-279.
The enantiomers were analyzed for optical rotation
to determine the polarization angle. The first enantiomer
to elute from the column has an optical rotation of -191.9°,
while the second enantiomer rotates the polarized light

The chiral molecule YK-4-279 was resolved into its
individual enantiomers using preparative high pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analytical trace
indicates the presence of two enantiomers (Figure 1A).
The retention time of the first enantiomer is 8.2 minutes,
while the retention of the second enantiomer is 20.0
minutes. Conditions from the batch analysis were scaled

Crystals were obtained from both (+) and (-) enantiomers.
The crystals of both the (+) and (-) enantiomers were
analyzed by x-ray crystallography. The (+) enantiomer
has (R)-configuration while the (-) enantiomer has (S)configuration (Figure 1B). Small molecule circular
dichroism demonstrated the expected mirror image spectra
of the individual enantiomers, while the racemate had zero
net rotation of light, indicating a mixture of two isomers in
equal proportions (Figure 1C).

complexed RHA in the lysates from cells treated with
either YK-4-279 or (S)-YK-4-279 (Figure 2B). The
control IgG lanes do not indicate the pull-down of either
EWS-FLI1 or RHA.
To determine the relative potency of YK-4-279 and
(S)-YK-4-279 to disrupt the binding between EWS-FLI1
and RHA in ESFT cells, we titrated down the amount of
small molecule (range = 0.3 to 10µM). TC32 cells were
treated for 15 hours before immunopreciptation followed
by immunoblotting for RHA complexes (Figure 2C).
Cells treated with vehicle or (R)-YK-4-279 were again
able to pull down RHA, as were cells treated with lower
doses of YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279, but the binding
between EWS-FLI1 and RHA was disrupted in a dosespecific fashion. Treatment did not affect the EWS-FLI1
or RHA levels (Figure 2D). Densitometry of RHA relative
to FLI1 was calculated and shows an IC50 of 4.9 µM for
the racemic and 1.8 µM for the (S)-YK-4-279, with a
significant difference between vehicle and cells treated
with 0.3µM (S)-YK-4-279, but not for cells treated with
the racemic molecule (Figure 2E). The experiment was
repeated three times and a representative blot is shown.

(S)-YK-4-279 disrupts binding of RHA with EWSFLI1
Previous studies from our group indicate the ability
of YK-4-279 to block the binding between EWS-FLI1
and RHA[14]. To determine if enantiospecific blocking of
this protein-protein interaction occurs, binding between
EWS-FLI1 and RHA was measured using ELISA. Wells
coated with EWS-FLI1 were treated with a range from
1µM to 30µM YK-4-279, (S)-YK-4-279, (R)-YK-4-279,
or vehicle. Both the racemate and (S)-YK-4-279 are able
to inhibit the protein-protein interaction with as little as
1µM small molecule, while (R)-YK-4-279 does not inhibit
the binding at 30µM (Figure 2A). Multiple ELISA runs
suggests that (S)-YK-4-279 is only slightly more potent at
disrupting the complex based upon increased dissociation
at 1µM.
Next, ESFT cells were treated with YK-4279, (S)-YK-4-279, and (R)-YK-4-279, followed by
immunoprecipitation of EWS-FLI1. We treated TC32 cells
with 10µM of the racemic or enantiomeric small molecule
for 15 hours, consistent with the KD value of YK-4279[14]. Immunoblotting showed coimmunoprecipitation
of EWS-FLI1 with RHA in the presence of vehicle or
(R)-YK-4-279, but there is a significant reduction in

EWS-FLI1 functional activity is reduced by only
one enantiomer
Since (S)-YK-4-279 is able to block the binding
between EWS-FLI1 and RHA, we next investigated
the ability of the enantiomers to reduce transcriptional
activity. We transfected COS7 cells with EWS-FLI1 and
the NR0B1-luciferase reporter plasmid, which contains
25 EWS-FLI1 DNA-binding sites. YK-4-279 and (S)YK-4-279 were able to inhibit EWS-FLI1 transcriptional
activity in a dose-dependent manner compared to vehicletreated cells (Figure 3A), with an IC50 of 0.96µM for
racemic and 0.75µM for the (S)-enantiomer. At a dose

of 0.3µM, luciferase activity was significantly reduced
from cells treated with (S)-YK-4-279 compared to vehicle
treated (p < 0.05), while treatment with racemic compared
to control was not significant. The (R)-enantiomer did not
show significant reduction from control. Data is averaged
from three experiments, each performed in triplicate.
Expression of EWS-FLI1 into COS7 was similar in each
experiment and a representative Western blot is shown
(Figure 3B).
EWS-FLI1 has been shown to increase Cyclin D1
levels by altering the D1b/D1a mRNA level in ESFT
cells through effects on transcript elongation [20]. Since
racemic YK-4-279 significantly decreases Cyclin D1
levels in TC32 cells[14], we evaluated whether this
effect was enantiospecific. We treated A673i cells with
1µM of YK-4-279 or enantiomer for 8 hours and then
analyzed mRNA for levels of Cyclin D1a and Cyclin
D1b using quantitative RT-PCR. As a positive control,
we reduced EWS-FLI1 protein levels in A673i with an
induced shRNA. With 1µM racemic YK-4-279 treatment,
there is a reduction in the D1b/D1a levels (Figure 3C).
The (S)-YK-4-279 is approximately 35% more potent
at the D1b/D1a reduction than racemic and reduced this
ratio to a level equivalent to the EWS-FLI1 reduction.
Consistent with other experiments, the (R)-YK-4-279
cells maintained a D1b/D1a ratio equivalent to the vehicle
treated cells. There was no decrease in EWS-FLI1 protein
expression in cells treated with small molecule (Figure
3D). Therefore, an enantiospecific effect was seen in a
second EWS-FLI1 activity assay.

MDA-MB-231, PANC1, and ASPC1 (Figure 4C, Table
1). Average IC50 values for the five non-ESFT cell lines
were 8.88µM for YK-4-279, 6.86µM for (S)-YK-4-279,
and >30µM for (R)-YK-4-279. There was no significant
difference between YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279 in any
of the non-ESFT cell lines. Therefore the enantiomeric

After determining that (S)-YK-4-279 is able to block
both the interaction between EWS-FLI1 and RHA as
well as reduce EWS-FLI1 function while (R)-YK-4-279
does not, we tested the small molecules for cytotoxicity
in a panel of ESFT cell lines compared to cell lines that
lack ets rearrangements. TC32, along with six other cell
lines expressing EWS-FLI1, were treated with either a
vehicle or dose of small molecule ranging from 0.1 to
30µM of compound for three days (Figure 4A). Six of
these cell lines demonstrated significant cytotoxicity to
(S)-YK-4-279 compared to racemic (p < 0.05, two-tailed
Student’s t-test) while the (R)-YK-4-279 enantiomer
demonstrated no specific toxicity. Experiments were
repeated three times in triplicate and mean IC50 values
ranged from 0.33µM to 1.83µM for racemic YK-4-279,
0.16µM to 0.87µM for (S)-YK-4-279, and 11.69µM
to 25.98µM for (R)-YK-4-279 (Figure 4B, Table 1),
indicating that (S)-YK-4-279 is the active enantiomer
in cytotoxicity studies. The effects of the enantiomers

enhancement of racemic compound to (S)-YK-4-279
is relatively specific for ESFT cells when compared to
cancer cell lines lacking EWS-FLI1.
A panel of Ewing’s and non-Ewing’s cell lines
were treated with 10µM small molecule for 18 hours
and assayed for caspase activation. Caspase-3 activity
increased from 3-fold to 18-fold upon treatment with
YK-4-279 and approximately 5-fold to 20-fold with
(S)-YK-4-279 in ESFT cells (TC32, RDES, SKES,
A4573, MMH-ES-1, STA-ET 7.2), but showed no more
than a 2-fold increase in apoptosis upon treatment with
racemic or either enantiomer in non-ESFT cells (MCF7,
MDA-MB-231, PANC1) (Figure 4D). To show that (S)YK-4-279 induces more apoptosis than racemic at lower
concentrations, we then treated A4573 ESFT cells with
increasing concentrations of YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279
for 18 hours (Figure 4E). The slope, representing the rate
of caspase activity increase, is greater between 0.3 and
1µM for the (S)-YK-4-279 (m = 7.23 ± 0.32) than the
racemic (m = 4.43 ± 0.66), but the caspase activity begins
to reach saturation by 3µM.

when (R)-enantiomer was given by IV injection. After
gavage administration, there were more pronounced
racemizations with 36.2% of (R)-enantiomer present in
urine when (S)-enantiomer was administered and 35.7%
of (S)-enantiomer when (R)-enantiomer was given. The
A4573 ESFT xenograft model was used to determine if
any racemization occurred in tumors. (S)-YK-4-279 was
administered by intravenous (IV) injections to A4573
tumor-bearing SCID mice. Tumors were resected two
hours following dosing. At that time, there was no (R)YK-4-279 present in tumor tissues after dosing with (S)YK-4-279. This lack of racemization within the tumors
supports development of the (S)-YK-4-279 for clinical
trials rather than the racemic mixture.

DISCUSSION
We recognized that the small molecule YK-4-279 has
a chiral center and can be separated into its enantiomers. In
binding assays and transcriptional assays, (S)-YK-4-279 is
active and titrations indicate more potency when compared
to the racemic, while (R)-YK-4-279 is inactive. The
cellular response to (S)-YK-4-279 demonstrates that it is
the active enantiomer in both apoptosis and growth assays
in EWS-FLI1 containing cells. These data characterize the
enantiospecificty of YK-4-279.
We show that YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279 are
able to block the EWS-FLI1/RHA interaction, but
(R)-YK-4-279 cannot. This clearly demonstrates the
importance of stereochemistry for the targeted disruption
of small molecule modulators of protein-protein
interactions. It further supports the hypothesis that small
molecule interactions with intrinsically disordered proteins
can have significant specificity, despite relatively low
affinity[21]. While the structure of the full-length EWSFLI1 protein still eludes us due to its intrinsic disorder, the
functional difference of the two enantiomers may help us

lack

Since there was such a clear difference in activity
between the two enantiomers, we evaluated the potential
for racemization in whole organisms, including ESFT
xenografts. YK-4-279 in racemic or purified enantiomeric
form was administered by intravenous (IV) injection
or oral gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats (Table 2). As
expected, since the racemic contains a 1:1 mixture of
each enantiomer, rats treated with each enantiomer
individually had 1.8- to 2.3-fold higher concentrations of
the specific enantiomer in plasma than rats treated with
the racemic (data not shown). There was no racemization
indicated in plasma after IV or gavage administration
since (R)-YK-4-279 was not present in the plasma
when (S)-YK-4-279 was administered and vice versa

Figure 4: (S)-YK-4-279 is the active enantiomer in cellular assays. (A) A panel of ESFT and non-ESFT cells were treated
with a dose range of small molecule. Cell viability was measured by WST after 72 hours of treatment. One representative graph from a
cytotoxicity assay is shown. Graphs show IC50 values for (B) ESFT and (C) non-ESFT cells (**, p < 0.05, using a two-tailed Student’s
t-test). (D) ESFT and non-ESFT cells were treated with 10µM small molecule for 18 hours. Graph shows fold caspase-3 activity of treated
cell lysates to control cell lysates. (E) A4573 cells were assayed for caspase-3 activation with increasing concentrations of YK-4-279 and
(S)-YK-4-279 for 18 hours. For all panels, black bars represent YK-4-279, blue bars represent (S)-YK-4-279, and red bars represent (R)YK-4-279.

between EWS-FLI1 and RHA, along with other proteinprotein interactions.
In order to evaluate the potency of the enantiomers
towards cells containing EWS-FLI1, we tested a panel
of cells in cytotoxicity and caspase assays. Our racemic
small molecule consists of equal parts of the (S)- and
(R)-enantiomers; thus one would expect a two-fold
difference in potency between the active enantiomer and
the racemate. Apoptosis was measured by the activation
of caspase-3. Through a dose titration, we do see the
expected two-fold difference in caspase activation between
ESFT cells treated with YK-4-279 and (S)-YK-4-279 for
18 hours, at lower concentrations while this saturates at
the highest concentrations. In each of the ESFT cell lines
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studied for cytotoxicity, (S)-YK-4-279 had a lower IC50
value than YK-4-279. The actual fold-differences between
the racemic and the active enantiomer vary from 1.18-fold
in RDES cells to more than a log-fold difference in TC71
cells. We tested cells containing all three major variant
translocation types of Ewing’s sarcoma and this difference
cannot be attributed to the specific translocation [3]. One
explanation for this is based on the steep nature of the dose
response curve, which causes large changes in IC50 based
on small shifts in viability. Differences in cellular uptake
or metabolism of YK-4-279, independent of translocation
type, may also account for the fold-difference between
racemic and active enantiomer.
The cytotoxicity and caspase results indicate
that (S)-YK-4-279 is the active enantiomer, and that

it retains specificity to ESFT cells containing an ETS
family transcription factor in comparison to non-Ewing’s
cells. Previously, non-transformed cell lines were tested
with racemic YK-4-279 and found to have IC50 values
of >30µM[14]. It is important to note that cell growth
of both MDA-MB-231 and PANC1 cells, breast and
pancreas respectively, were reduced by YK-4-279 and
(S)-YK-4-279. These cell lines were previously reported
to have IC50 values of >20µM; however, we received
these cell lines from a different source than previously
used and the current clones are more sensitive. Despite
the increased sensitivity in cytotoxicity studies, the IC50
values for MDA-MB-231 and PANC1 cells were lower
for the racemic than the active enantiomer and there
was no statistical significance between treatments with
racemic and (S)-YK-4-279. When tested for caspase-3
activation, neither of these cell lines exhibited more than
2-fold caspase-activation, in comparison to the ESFT
cells, which averaged 8.8-fold for YK-4-279 and 10.3fold for (S)-YK-4-279 treatment across the panel of six
cell lines. Although YK-4-279 and the enantiomer may
have increased toxicity in MDA-MB-231 and PANC
cells, the mechanism of action may be different than in
ESFT cell lines. Recent studies have identified caspaseindependent cell death factors induced by anticancer
drugs[22], including apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)[23],
endonuclease G[24], and HtrA2[25], which may explain
the increase in cytotoxicity without caspase activation in
these two non-ESFT cell lines. Further studies focusing
on caspase-independent cell death may explain why
these cells exhibit cytotoxicity toward YK-4-279 but do
not undergo apoptosis and may inform other potential
mechanisms of activity.
In preparation for clinical trials, we evaluated the
potential racemization of YK-4-279. Pharmacokinetic
studies in rats show no conversion between (S)YK-4-279 and (R)-YK-4-279 in the plasma following IV
dosing and very minimal conversion in urine. However,
there is increased racemization in urine, but no sign of
conversion in plasma, after the gavage administration,
which may be attributed to low oral bioavailability (26% for (S)-YK-4-279 and 8-15% for (R)-YK-4-279) and
much slower elimination of YK-4-279 compared to the
IV administration. Importantly, no enantioconversion
was seen in the tumors. Taken together, these results
suggest that the chirality of YK-4-279 does not change
in the plasma or tumor tissues. The conversion in the
urine indicates either a tissue-specific presence of an
enzyme that isomerizes YK-4-279 or a gastric effect
that alters compound structure. Additional experiments
testing biospecificity are necessary to further study the
pharmacokinetics of (S)-YK-4-279 in vivo to advance the
small molecule to clinical trials. Although xenograft mice
treated with YK-4-279 exhibited no toxicity when treated
with 75 mg per kg body weight[14], separating out the
inactive enantiomer may allow for a reduction in dosage

or an increased effect.
ETS rearrangements are present in 40-70% of
all prostate cancers, including those that are the most
clinically aggressive[26-28]. These aggressive prostate
cancers fuse the promoter of TMPRSS2, an androgen
responsive gene, to an ETS family transcription factor,
such as ETV1 or ERG[29], both of which have also been
identified in joining to EWS in ESFT to form an oncogenic
fusion protein[30-32]. Recent experiments from our group
have also indicated that YK-4-279 is able to inhibit ERG
and ETV1 fusion-positive prostate cancer cell lines[33],
and the activity and function of the enantiomers should
be further investigated in prostate cancer. Our data
support the ability to disrupt a critical oncogenic proteinprotein interaction with YK-4-279 and the importance of
enantiospecificity in disrupting EWS-FLI1 from RHA. A
small molecule targeted to the ETS family of transcription
factors with minimal side effects would be an important
development in treatment for patients with ESFT and other
ETS-family oncogenic fusion proteins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Separation of YK-4-279
The chemical and chiral HPLC analyses were
performed using Waters XBridge C18 (250mm x 4.6mm)
and Chiral Technologies Chiralpak AD (250mm x 4.6mm)
columns, respectively. The enantiomers were resolved by
preparative HPLC using a Chiralpak AD column (250mm
x 77mm) packed in-house using a Varian DynamaxTM
Rampak Column Packing Station model 41.4/77. Mobile
phase was 60% 2-propanol in heptane and flow rate was
maintained at 250ml/min. All mobile phase batches were
premixed by volume. Sample solution was prepared
for purification by dissolving the sample in 10:40:50
dichloromethane/reagent alcohol/heptane. The fractions
collected during the purification were transferred to round
bottom flasks and evaporated using mild temperature
conditions (30 – 35°C) until all solvent was removed. The
analytical HPLC system used for method development
and sample analyses was a Waters 2695 Alliance Systems
coupled to a Waters 996 Photo Diode (PDA) detector.
Preparative HPLC separations were performed using a
Waters Delta Prep 2000/4000 equipped with #7 pump
heads coupled to a Waters 484 UV-Vis detector. Optical
rotation analyses were performed using a Perkin-Elmer
Model 343 Polarimeter with c = 10 mg/ml in methanol
and T = 25°C.

Resolution and Crystallography of YK-4-279
Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments
were obtained through slow evaporation of a solution
containing ethyl acetate. The diffraction experiments
were performed at 100K on a Rigaku R-axis Rapid
179

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting

diffactometer, equipped with a Mo Kα radiation source
(60kV, 40mA). HKL-2000 was used for control of the data
collection as well as data reduction[34]. The structure was
solved and refined by the HKL-3000SM system, which
is integrated with SHELXS, SHELXL[35], and 0[36,
37]. Absolute configurations of both compounds were
determined using anomalous dispersion. Both compounds
crystallized in space group P1 with five molecules of
the YK-4-279 and disordered solvent molecules in the
asymmetric unit.

TC32 were grown to ~70% confluency and cells
were treated for 15 hours with small molecule. Nuclear
lysate was collected using the Active Motif Magnetic
Co-IP Kit (Active Motif). Protein concentration was
determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay for
each lysate (Pierce) and lysate was bound to 1µg of
antibody overnight at 4C on a rotating axis with addition
of same concentration of small molecule as used for 15
hour treatment. Magnetic beads (Active Motif) were
added to the lysates and tumbled for 2 hours at 4C.
Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved using 10%
PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in
5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20mM Tris-HCl, 150mM
NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 2 hours. FLI1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies) and RHA (Abcam) antibodies were used
at 1:1000 dilutions in 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 hours.
Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (GE
Healthcare) was added for 1 hour. Detection was carried
out using Millipore Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent
HRP Substrate per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore Corp.). Chemiluminescence was detected
using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system. Densitometry
values were obtained using ImageJ software.

Small Molecule Circular Dichroism
Circular dichroism was studied using 100µM
YK-4-279 and 50µM of each enantiomer in a buffer
containing 1% ethanol, 5mM sodium phosphate, and
50mM potassium fluoride, pH 7.4. Data is averaged from
5 or more independent scans. Scans were performed on a
Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter from 400 – 190 nm with a
bandwidth of 5.0nm, a response of 8 seconds, and a scan
speed of 50 nm/minute.

ELISA
EWS-FLI1 was used to coat the surface of a 96
well plate (MaxiSorb) at a concentration of 150ng/
well in 100µL buffer containing 20mM Tris, 500mM
sodium chloride, and 1M imidazole. Following overnight
incubation, the plate was blocked with 4% BSA in PBS
and washed with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20. Small molecules
were added at concentrations of 1µM, 3µM, 10µM, and
30µM, followed by RHA (300ng/well) and allowed
to incubate overnight. Following washing, incubation
with RHA antibody (Everest) and anti-goat secondary,
protein binding was detected using a TMB Peroxidase
EIA Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad) per the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Reporter Assay
Cells were transiently transfected with the NR0B1
luciferase reporter[20] and full length EWS-FLI1 into
COS7 cells with Fugene-6 (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Two hours after transformation,
cells were treated with 0.3, 1, and 3µM of YK-4-279, (S)YK-4-279, and (R)-YK-4-279. Luciferase activity was
measured 16 hours after treatment. Protein concentration
was normalized by absorbance at 280nm. All luciferase
assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega).

Quantitative RT-PCR

Cellular Proliferation Assays

A673i cells[38] were treated with 1µM small
molecule for 8 hours. Positive control cells were treated
with tetracycline for 72 hours to knock down expression
of EWS-FLI1. Total RNA was extracted using an
RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed
using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Roche) per the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was
performed using an Eppendorf Mastercycler Realplex
with FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master with ROX
(Roche) with primers for 18S, CyclinD1a, and CyclinD1b.
Data were analyzed for expression relative to 18S using
the comparative Ct method. Data from four separate
experiments performed in duplicate were averaged.

TC32, TC71, RDES, MMH-ES-1, STA-ET 7.2,
A4573, and PC3 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% FBS
and 1% HEPES. SKES cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A
medium with 15% FBS. MCF7, MDA-MB-231, PANC1,
and ASPC1 cells were grown in colorless DMEM with
10% FBS. Cells were grown at a plating density of 5,000
– 15,000 cells/well, depending on cell line, in a 96-well
plate. Small molecule or vehicle alone (DMSO) were
added to cells in appropriate growth media the day after
plating. After three days, viable cells were quantified using
WST (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
IC50 values were calculated by sigmoidal dose-response

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
All pharmacokinetic studies were performed
using Sprague-Dawley rats. Nine rats per gender were
assigned to nine dose groups, which received either a
single IV injection of YK-4-279, (S)-YK-4-279, or (R)YK-4-279 at a target dose of 25 mg/kg, or a single gavage
administration of small molecule at a target dose level of
25 or 50 mg/kg. Plasma was obtained from the rats and
samples were processed by liquid extraction followed
by analysis using liquid chromatography with mass
spectrometry (LC/MS). Average urine concentrations were
measured at intervals from 0-4, 4-8, and 8-12 hours after
dosing. 18 Fox Chase SCID Beige mice were injected with
A4573 cells and received six doses of (S)-YK-4-279 at
75 mg/kg to determine concentration of small molecule
in the tumors.
