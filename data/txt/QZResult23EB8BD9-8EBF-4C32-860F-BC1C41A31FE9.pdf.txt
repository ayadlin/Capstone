SUMMARY
Poor penetration of drugs into tumors is a major obstacle in tumor treatment. We describe a strategy
for peptide-mediated delivery of compounds deep into the tumor parenchyma that employs a tumor
homing peptide, iRGD (CRGDK/RGPD/EC). Intravenously injected compounds coupled to iRGD
bound to tumor vessels and spread into the extravascular tumor parenchyma, whereas conventional
RGD peptides only delivered the cargo to the blood vessels. iRGD homes to tumors through a 3-step
process: The RGD motif mediates binding to αv integrins on tumor endothelium, a proteolytic
cleavage then exposes a binding motif for neuropilin-1, which mediates penetration into tissue and
cells. Conjugation to iRGD significantly improved the sensitivity of tumor imaging agents and
enhanced the activity of an anti-tumor drug.

SIGNIFICANCE
Targeted delivery of compounds to tumor vessels and tumor cells can enhance tumor detection
and therapy. Docking-based (synaphic) targeting strategies use peptides, antibodies and other
molecules that bind to tumor vessels and tumor cells to deliver more drug to tumors than to
normal tissues. A major obstacle to applying this principle has been the limited transport of
the targeted payload into tumor parenchyma. The iRGD peptide we describe here overcomes
this limitation and establishes a capability for tissue-penetrating drug delivery.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The vasculature in different tissues expresses distinct biochemical signatures, the “vascular zip
codes” (Ruoslahti, 2002; Ruoslahti and Rajotte, 2000). Vascular zip codes can serve as targets
for docking-based (synaphic) delivery of diagnostics and therapeutics. αv-integrins are highly
expressed in tumor vasculature, where they can be accessed with peptides containing the RGD
integrin recognition motif (Eliceiri and Cheresh, 2001; Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti, 1984;
Ruoslahti, 2002; Ruoslahti, 2003). RGD-based synaphic targeting has been successfully used
to deliver drugs, biologicals (Arap et al., 1998; Curnis et al., 2004), imaging agents (Sipkins
et al., 1998), viruses (Pasqualini et al., 1997; Wickham, 2000), and nanoparticles (Murphy et
al., 2008) to tumor vasculature. However, crossing the vascular wall and penetrating into the
tumor parenchyma against the elevated interstitial pressure in tumors remains a major challenge
in tumor therapy (Heldin et al., 2004; Jain, 1990).
We have recently identified a consensus R/KXXR/K motif as a mediator of cell and tissue
penetration (Teesalu et al., 2009). The receptor for the R/KXXR/K motif was shown to be
neuropilin-1. This motif is not active unless it occupies a C-terminal position in the peptide;
we refer to this position effect as the C-end Rule (CendR).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The interaction between the CendR motif and neuropilin-1 appears to be a key determinant for
penetration of biological barriers. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-165 and certain semaphorins bind to neuropilin-1 through C-terminal CendR motifs
and thereby increase vascular permeability (Acevedo et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2006; Soker et al.,
1998; Teesalu et al., 2009). In addition, many viruses possess CendR motifs within their capsid
proteins, and often require proteolytic cleavage to expose the CendR motif to be infective, a
process that requires penetration of biological barriers (Steinhauer, 1999; Teesalu et al.,
2009). One such virus, HTLV-1, has been shown to utilize its CendR motif (KPXR) to bind
to and internalize into immune cells in a neuropilin-1-dependent fashion to infect the cells
(Lambert et al., 2009).
We hypothesized that the tissue-penetrating properties of the CendR system could be used to
deliver drugs and nanoparticles into tumor parenchyma, beyond the vascular barrier. Here we
report results obtained with a peptide that combines tumor-homing and CendR-dependent
tissue-penetrating properties. We also evaluate the potential of the technology for clinical
applications by performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor treatment studies.

RESULTS
Identification of iRGD

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used a cyclic CX7C (C = cysteine; X = any amino acid) peptide library displayed on T7
phage (diversity approximately 109; Hoffman et al., 2003) to identify peptides that recognize
tumor blood vessels in experimental metastasis mouse models of human prostate cancer (Figure
S1). Three rounds of ex vivo phage display selection with cell suspensions from bone tumors
were followed by one in vivo selection for homing to the bone tumors (Hoffman et al., 2003).
The resulting phage pools bound to tumor-derived cell suspensions 200–400 times more than
the original library, and the binding to the tumor cell suspensions was 5 times higher than to
cell suspensions from normal bone (Figure 1A). Individual phage clones were randomly picked
from the phage pools and sequenced. Phage that contained the RGD motif (Pierschbacher and
Ruoslahti, 1984; Ruoslahti, 2003) within three related sequences, CRGDKGPDC,
CRGDRGPDC, and CRGDKGPEC, dominated in the selected pools (Figure 1B).
CRGDKGPDC, which was most frequent, bound to cultured PPC1 human prostate cancer cells
at 4°C, and appeared to internalize into them at 37°C (Figure 1C), and was named
“iRGD” (internalizing-RGD).

Homing of iRGD to tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We synthesized a fluorescein-labeled iRGD (FAM-iRGD) and intravenously injected the
peptide into tumor-bearing mice. FAM-iRGD accumulated in tumor tissue in every model we
tested; these include orthotopic xenografts of prostate, pancreatic ductal, and breast cancer,
bone and brain xenografts of prostate carcinoma, and genetically engineered models of de novo
pancreatic neuroendocrine (islet), pancreatic ductal, and cervical cancer (summarized in Table
S1). The tumors, but not normal tissues, were strongly fluorescent under UV light (Figure 2A
and Figure S2). Confocal microscopy revealed accumulation of FAM-iRGD peptide in and
around tumor vessels and in tumor parenchyma (Figure 2B), but not in normal tissues (Figure
S3). Remarkably, iRGD phage (diameter about 65 nm; Sokoloff et al., 2000) and a synthetic
iRGD-coated nanoparticle, self-assembling micelles (diameter 15–25 nm; Arleth et al.,
2005;Karmali et al., 2009), also reached extravascular tumor parenchyma (Figures 2B). Two
conventional RGD peptides and their corresponding peptide-displaying phage, CRGDC and
RGD-4C, which both have strong affinities for αv integrins (Koivunen et al., 1993;Koivunen
et al., 1995), also homed to tumors, but accumulated only in and around tumor blood vessels,
and did not disperse throughout the interstitium like iRGD (Figure 2B). Quantification of the
area of peptide homing further demonstrated that iRGD homes to and spreads within the tumor
tissue far more efficiently than CRGDC (Figure 2C). The difference in the distribution of
payloads linked to iRGD and other RGD peptides was even more pronounced when a
genetically engineered model of de novo pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; Hezel et
al., 2006) with an extensive amount of interstitium was used as the target (Figure S4). Whole
body imaging of PDAC mice injected with FAM-iRGD micelles labeled with the near-infrared
dye, Cy7, produced a strong and specific signal in the tumors, illustrating the potential of iRGD
for tumor targeting (Figure S5).
Integrin-dependent binding of iRGD to tumor cells
The in vivo homing of iRGD to tumors is dependent on the RGD motif. Control peptides
including a non-integrin binding variant (Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti, 1984; Ruoslahti,
2003), CRGEKGPDC (iRGE), produced minimal tumor fluorescence (Figure 3A). Coinjecting an excess of unlabeled iRGD peptide reduced the accumulation of FAM-iRGD in
tumors, whereas iRGE peptide did not have such effect (Figure 3B). The in vitro binding of
iRGD to cancer cells also required the RGD motif because the binding of iRGD phage to PPC1
cells at 4°C was inhibited dose dependently by free iRGD peptide, but not by iRGE (Figure
3C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The RGD-directed integrins αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1, are upregulated in angiogenic endothelial
cells and certain tumor cells (Eliceiri and Cheresh, 2001; Ruoslahti, 2002). PPC1 cells express
αvβ5 and α5β1, but not αvβ3 (Figure S6A). An anti-αvβ5 antibody almost completely inhibited
iRGD phage binding to PPC1 cells, whereas inhibitory antibodies against α5β1 and other
integrins had no effect (Figure S6B). M21 human melanoma cells (Cheresh and Spiro, 1987;
Figure S7) expressing both αvβ3 and αvβ5 bound iRGD phage, whereas variants lacking
expression of these integrins did not, confirming the αv integrin dependency of iRGD binding
(Figure 3D). The binding of the iRGD phage was reduced by both anti-αvβ3 or anti-αvβ5
(Figure 3D), indicating that iRGD recognizes both of these integrins.
The binding affinity of synthetic iRGD peptide to purified αvβ3 integrin was Kd = 17.8 ± 8.6
nM, and Kd = 61.7 ± 13.3 nM to αvβ5 integrin (Table S2). The affinities of two previously
identified cyclic RGD peptides, RGD-4C and CRGDC (Koivunen et al., 1993;Koivunen et al.,
1995), for αvβ3 and αvβ5 were also in the same range, as shown by measuring the ability of
each peptide to block iRGD binding (Table S2). Thus, differences in integrin-binding
specificity or affinity do not explain the distinct ability of iRGD from the other two RGD

peptides to penetrate tumor cells and tissue. Rather, the evidence implicates a second motif in
iRGD, dubbed the CendR motif, in this capability.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

iRGD as a CendR peptide
iRGD contains a cryptic CendR motif, RGDK/R, and possesses CendR-like tissue and cell
penetrating activities (Teesalu et al., 2009). However, the CendR motif in iRGD is not Cterminal, which is a prerequisite for CendR activity (Teesalu et al., 2009). Therefore, we
hypothesized that iRGD, having been recruited to cell surfaces through the RGD-integrin
interactions, is proteolytically processed and that the processing generates a C-terminal RGDK/
R sequence capable of binding to neuropilin-1 (schematized in Figure 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate this proteolysis hypothesis, we first examined whether iRGD binds to PPC1
cells in a CendR-dependent manner after being treated by a protease to expose a C-terminal
arginine or lysine; PPC1 cells have substantial levels of neuropilin-1 expression (Teesalu et
al., 2009). Since the protease(s) that we postulate to cleave iRGD is unknown, we chose to use
trypsin for this purpose, as its specificity predicts that it would produce a derivative iRGD
peptide with the requisite C-terminal arginine or lysine. As shown in Figure 5A, trypsin
treatment of iRGD phage enhanced the binding of iRGD phage to PPC1 cells to a level
comparable to a prototypic CendR peptide, RPARPAR (Teesalu et al., 2009). Trypsin had no
effect on phage expressing CRGDC (Figure 5A) or RGD-4C (not shown). The binding at 4°C
of the trypsin-treated iRGD phage was blocked by UV-treated non-infectious phage expressing
RPARPAR, but not by phage displaying a peptide in which the CendR motif was disrupted by
addition of an alanine residue to the C-terminus (RPARPARA; Teesalu et al., 2009). The
binding of intact iRGD phage was not affected by RPARPAR (not shown), supporting our
hypothesis that iRGD does not exhibit CendR features unless its CendR motif is activated by
exposure at the C-terminus.
To determine whether the CendR motif in iRGD is indeed activated by cellular proteases, we
incubated FAM-iRGD that carries the fluorophore at its N-terminus with PPC1 prostate cancer
cells, and isolated intracellular products by affinity chromatography on anti-FITC (FAM)
antibodies. To prevent cytoplasmic proteolysis, while allowing proteolysis at the cell surface,
the incubation was done in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. We detected no intracellular
full-length FAM-iRGD, but recovered the FAM-CRGDK fragment (Figure S8). When iRGD
with FAM on its C-terminus was used, no intracellular iRGD fragment was recovered (not
shown). These results show that CRGDK, the N-terminal half of iRGD with a C-terminal
CendR motif, is the cell-penetrating fragment of iRGD, as postulated in Figure 4.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prompted by the results indicating that proteolytically released CRGDK is the active cell
penetrating component of iRGD, we engineered phage expressing CRGDK, and found that it
bound to and penetrated into PPC1 cells. The binding of the CRGDK phage was inhibited by
CRGDK peptide indicating a specific binding (Figure 5B). The binding process was also
inhibited by the RPARPAR peptide, which has a C-terminal arginine, but not by
RPARPARA (Figure 5B). Antibodies against various integrins, including αv integrins, had no
effect on the CRGDK binding, indicating that the binding is CendR-dependent and does not
involve integrins (not shown). Moreover, an antibody against neuropilin-1, the receptor for
CendR peptides (Teesalu et al., 2009), reduced the binding (Figure 5C). CRGDK phage did
not substantially bind to or penetrate into M21 cells, which express only minimal amounts of
neuropilin-1 (Figure S9). However, forced expression of neuropilin-1 in these cells (Teesalu
et al., 2009) increased the binding (Figure 5D) and penetration (not shown) approximately 3.5
fold. Affinity measurements revealed that the CRGDK peptide binds to neuropilin-1 with a
Kd (1.4 ± 0.6 µM; Table S2) similar to that of RPARPAR (Kd = 1.7 ± 0.2 µM; Teesalu et al.,
2009). These results indicate that CRGDK binds to cells and penetrates into them using the
CendR pathway.

In keeping with the possibility that the RGDK CendR element is the cell-penetrating sequence
in iRGD, both CRGDK and RPARPAR UV-treated phage inhibited iRGD phage penetration
into PPC1 cells at 37°C (Figure 5E). Anti-neuropilin-1 also inhibited the penetration of iRGD
phage (Figure 5F), but had little effect on binding of iRGD phage to PPC1 cells at 4°C (not
shown). We further tested the relative roles of the RGD and RXXK motifs in iRGD by using
the iRGE phage, which does not bind to integrins due to the disrupted RGD motif
(Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti, 1984; Ruoslahti, 2003), but still contains a CendR motif, RXXK.
The iRGE phage did penetrate PPC1 cells at 37°C, and both RPARPAR and CRGDK inhibited
the penetration (Figure 5E), implicating the CendR pathway. The penetration was less effective
than that of iRGD, presumably because iRGE lacks integrin binding that would concentrate
the phage at the cell surface. These results indicate that iRGD penetrates cells through the
CendR pathway utilizing the RXXK sequence, and that the penetration is likely facilitated by
initial binding to integrins through RGD.
Confocal microscopy showed that iRGD phage and neuropilin-1 co-localized in cultured cells
(Figure S10), supporting the involvement of the neuropilin-1-dependent CendR pathway in
the tumor cell penetration by iRGD. Phage displaying an iRGD variant that lacks the CendR
motif (CRGDGGPDC) or the two other conventional RGD peptides, CRGDC and RGD-4C,
did not co-localize with neuropilin-1, nor did they penetrate the cells efficiently.

Neuropilin-1-dependent penetration of iRGD within tumor tissue
We next investigated the neuropilin-1 dependence of in vivo tissue penetration by iRGD into
PDAC. Pre-injection of tumor-bearing mice with a function-blocking anti-neuropilin-1
antibody inhibited the penetration of iRGD phage in tumor tissue. The phage were trapped in
the tumor blood vessels or stayed in close association with the vessels (Figure 6A, right panel).
Pre-injection of control IgG did not affect the spreading of iRGD (Figure 6A, left panel). Phage
expressing the iRGD variant that lacks the CendR motif but retains RGD (CRGDGGPDC)
targeted tumor blood vessels, but did not spread into tumor tissue (not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies on the time dependence of iRGD homing and penetration further supported the
importance of αv integrin and neuropilin-1 expression in this process. FAM-iRGD peptide
injected intravenously into mice bearing PDAC tumors initially co-localized with tumor blood
vessels, which were positive for both αv integrins and neuropilin-1 (Figure 6B, upper panels,
arrows). The peptide subsequently extravasated, presumably because it induces increased
permeability in tumor vessels (Teesalu et al., 2009), and gradually appeared within tumor cells
in ductal structures (Figure 6B, middle panels). Most of the tumor cells were positive for αv
integrins (Figure 6B, left panels). Importantly, tumor cells strongly positive for neuropilin-1
were particularly effective at accumulating and retaining FAM-iRGD (Figure 6B, right panels).
Similar results were obtained in an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft model; the iRGD
peptide also homed to areas that over-express both αv integrins and neuropilin-1 in these
tumors. The human 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells used in the model express αv-integrins and
neuropilin-1 on the cell surface (Figures S11A and S11B).
iRGD in tumor imaging and treatment
To investigate the potential of iRGD for clinical applications, we performed MRI and
therapeutic targeting experiments. For MRI, mice bearing 22Rv1 orthotopic xenografts were
injected intravenously with iRGD peptide-linked superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms
(about 80 nm long and 30 nm thick; Park et al., 2009; Simberg et al., 2007). Iron oxide
nanoparticles are evidenced as hypointensities in T2-weighted MR images (McAteer et al.,
2007). In addition to hypointense vascular signals, the iRGD-nanoworms gave low intensity
regions that spread throughout the tumor, while CRGDC-nanoworms only decreased the
intensity of the tumor vasculature (Figure 7, T2-weighted MR images). Untargeted-nanoworms

produced no detectable signal under identical imaging conditions. Confocal microscopy of the
tumors confirmed the enhanced tissue penetration of the iRGD-nanoworms (Figure 7, right
most panels). Both the MRI results and optical imaging (Figure S5) indicate that iRGD is
capable of delivering diagnostics to tumors, and that tumors are more efficiently visualized
with this peptide than with conventional RGD peptides.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of iRGD to deliver anti-cancer drugs was investigated by treating mice bearing
orthotopic 22Rv1 tumors with iRGD-coated abraxane, a 130 nm nanoparticle consisting of
albumin-embedded paclitaxel (Haley and Frenkel, 2008; Karmali et al., 2009). In vitro, iRGDabraxane inhibited the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells more efficiently than abraxane conjugated
with a cyclic RGD peptide without a CendR motif (CRGDC; Koivunen et al., 1993) or abraxane
alone (Figure S12A). Intravenously injected iRGD-abraxane spread more within tumor tissue
than the other abraxane formulations (Figures S12B). Quantification of the drug showed that
8 fold more abraxane accumulated in the tumors from injections of iRGD-abraxane than of
non-targeted-abraxane (Figure 8A). CRGDC-abraxane concentration was only about 2 fold
higher than that of non-targeted-abraxane in the tumors. In line with these results, iRGDabraxane treatment resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth at a dose at which
untargeted abraxane showed no significant effect (Figure 8B); the slight reduction in tumor
growth in the CRGDC group was not statistically significant. Treatment with the iRGD peptide
alone at a dose equivalent to its molar amount in iRGD-abraxane did not affect tumor growth,
indicating that the effect of iRGD-abraxane was not due to the disruption of the integrin
signaling by the iRGD peptide. An additional treatment study in a subcutaneous 22Rv1 tumor
model with time-dependent tumor volume measurements confirmed the treatment data
obtained with the orthotopic tumors (Figure S13B). A similar biodistribution of the abraxane
formulations was also observed in the subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors (Figure S13A).
We next tested the efficacy of iRGD-abraxane in a tumor model unrelated to 22Rv1. We chose
orthotopic tumors generated with the BT474 human breast cancer cell line, which expresses
both αv integrins and neuropilin-1 at the cell surface (Figure S14). In addition, the BT474 cells
are more resistant to abraxane (paclitaxel) than 22Rv1 as shown in cytotoxicity assays (Figure
S15). When injected intravenously into the tumor mice, the iRGD-abraxane accumulated in
the tumor 11 fold more than non-targeted-abraxane and about 4 fold more than the CRGDCabraxane (Figure 8C). Despite the resistance of the BT474 cells to paclitaxel, the iRGDabraxane significantly inhibited the tumor growth in vivo (Figure 8D). The other abraxane
formulations or iRGD peptide alone did not show significant effects at the same dose. Together,
these results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of iRGD in drug delivery.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our results delineate a technology to deliver diagnostics and therapeutics into the extravascular
tumor parenchyma using a unique tumor-specific homing peptide, iRGD. The iRGD peptide
follows a multi-step tumor targeting mechanism; the intact peptide binds to the surface of cells
expressing αv integrins, where it is proteolytically cleaved to produce the CRGDK fragment.
This fragment then binds to neuropilin-1 and penetrates tumor cells and tissues (schematized
in Figure 4). Several pieces of data support the model. First, the affinity of iRGD for αv integrins
is in the mid to low nanomolar range, similar to that of RGD peptides previously used in tumor
targeting (Koivunen et al., 1993;Koivunen et al., 1995). Significantly, the proteolytically
processed CRGDK fragment we identified within the targeted cells has lost most of its affinity
to the integrins (about 50- to 150-fold reduction in affinity), which is in agreement with the
observation that RGDK peptides lack cell attachment activity (Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti,
1984). Instead, the CRGDK fragment acquires an affinity for neuropilin-1 that is stronger than
its residual affinity for αv integrins. These changes likely facilitate the transfer of CRGDK
from integrins to neuropilin-1, and the resulting penetration activities. Each step in this multi-

step process evidently adds to the tumor specificity of iRGD. The expression of αv integrins
is largely restricted to tumors (and other sites of angiogenesis or tissue repair), and neuropilin-1
is elevated in multiple tumor types (Eliceiri and Cheresh, 2001;Pellet-Many et al.,
2008;Ruoslahti, 2002). The same may be true of the yet unknown processing protease(s). For
example, matriptase, a membrane-bound protease, which preferentially cleaves proteins after
a sequence similar to the R/KXXR/K CendR motif, is over-expressed in a number of tumor
types (Uhland, 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The initial recruitment of iRGD to cell surfaces appears to be crucial for its pronounced tumor
targeting ability, since the related but non-integrin-binding peptide iRGE showed only modest
uptake into cultured cells and was inefficient in targeting tumors in vivo. The presence of the
tumor-specific recruitment element, RGD, distinguishes iRGD from some previously
described tumor-targeting peptides. Jiang et al. (Jiang et al., 2004) have described a design for
tumor-homing peptides, in which a cationic cell-penetrating peptide is tethered to a negatively
charged sequence that blocks the cell penetrating activity. The tether contains a recognition
sequence for a protease known to be elevated in tumors. These authors achieved a 3-fold
increase in tumor homing. The greater homing we achieved with iRGD (12-fold over a control
peptide) is likely due to the RGD-directed specific homing of the intact peptide. In addition,
the recruitment of iRGD to the cell surface through the RGD-integrin interaction is probably
needed for the proteolytic cleavage that triggers the subsequent tumor penetration, as protease
inhibitors are generally inactive on cell surfaces, but block proteolysis elsewhere (Hall et al.,
1991). The unbiased screening we performed in identifying iRGD may also have selected for
a protease that is more readily available to cleave an incoming peptide than the proteases with
known expression but unknown availability in tumors.
Integrins shuttle between the cell surface and intracellular compartments (Pellinen and Ivaska,
2006). Certain viral pathogens take advantage of this mechanism in entering cells (Pellinen
and Ivaska, 2006). However, as shown by our results, the cell penetrating activity of iRGD is
far greater than that of conventional RGD peptides. It far exceeds what can be accomplished
with conventional RGD peptides and their mimics, which only take payloads to tumor vessels
(this study; Murphy et al., 2008; Pasqualini et al., 1997). The strong tumor MRI signals
provided by iRGD-coated iron oxide nanoworms and the enhanced tumor growth suppression
by iRGD-linked abraxane demonstrate the potential of this peptide in tumor targeting.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The molecular mechanism of the rapid tumor tissue penetration of iRGD remains to be
elucidated. However, several lines of evidence suggest that it may involve the so-called
vascular permeabilization in the tumor induced by the CendR property of iRGD. Molecules
such as VEGF-165 and some semaphorins that have exposed CendR motifs increase vascular
permeability (Jia et al., 2006; Acevedo et al., 2008). In addition, we have recently demonstrated
that a prototypic CendR peptide RPARPAR induces vascular permeability (Teesalu et al.,
2009). Some previously described tumor-specific cell-penetrating peptides that contain cryptic
CendR sequences may share the same CendR-dependent tissue penetration mechanism
(Hoffman et al., 2003; Joyce et al., 2003; Laakkonen et al., 2002; Porkka et al., 2002). For
example, LyP-1 (CGNKRTRGC; Laakkonen et al., 2002), a cyclic peptide with a binding site
for a specific receptor (Fogal et al., 2008) contains a cryptic CendR motif, KRTR. Like iRGD
nanoparticles, LyP-1-coated nanoparticles extravasate into tumor tissue within minutes after
an intravenous injection (Karmali et al., 2009; Laakkonen et al., 2002; von Maltzahn et al.,
2008). CendR involvement in the activities of LyP-1 and other tumor-penetrating homing
peptides remains to be studied, but seems likely. iRGD and the CendR system may help bring
the “magic bullet” treatment of cancer closer to reality.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Tumor models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animal experimentation was performed according to procedures approved by the Animal
Research Committees at the University of California, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and San
Francisco, and the Burnham Institute for Medical Research. Xenografts were created by
injecting nude mice with 106 human cancer cells orthotopically, subcutaneously, or into the
tibia and the brain: prostate cancers PC-3 (Yang et al., 1999), PPC1 (Zhang et al., 2006), and
22Rv1 (Drake et al., 2005), pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 (Sugahara et al., 2008), and breast
cancer BT474 (Rusnak et al., 2001). Disseminated prostate tumors were generated by injecting
106 GFP-PC-3 cells (Yang et al., 1999) into the left ventricle of the heart of nude mice. Tumors
were monitored with the X-ray system of the Image Station In Vivo FX (Eastman Kodak

Encinitas, CA). Transgenic mice were maintained as described (Arbeit et al., 1994; Hanahan,
1985; Hezel et al., 2006).
In vivo peptide and phage homing

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 200 µg of FAM-labeled synthetic peptides (Karmali et al., 2009) were
intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice and allowed to circulate for 15 min to 2 hrs.
Tissues were collected and observed under UV light (Illumatool Bright Light System
LT-9900), and processed for immunofluorescence (Karmali et al., 2009) or
immunohistochemistry (Sugahara et al., 2008). To quantify the homing area of peptides within
tumors, cryo-sections immunohistochemically stained with an anti-FITC antibody were
scanned with the Scanscope CM-1 scanner and analyzed with the ImageScope software (Aperio
Technologies, Vista, CA; Fogal et al., 2008). To assess phage homing (Zhang et al., 2006),
109 plaque-forming units (pfu) of T7 phage were intravenously injected into tumor-bearing
mice, and allowed to circulate for 15 min. The mice were perfused through the heart with PBS
containing 1% BSA and tissues were harvested for immunofluorescence. In some experiments,
50 µg of function-blocking anti-neuropilin-1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or
goat IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was intravenously injected into the tumor mice 15 min
prior to the phage injections. The phage were allowed to circulate for 10 min prior to perfusion
and collection of the tumors and other tissues.
Preparation of micelles
Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DSPE-PEG2,000-iRGD(FAM) was prepared by coupling FAM-iRGD peptide bearing a
cysteine on its N-terminus to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-maleimide
(polyethylene glycol)2,000 (DSPE-PEG2,000-maleimide) at 1:1 molar ratio at room temperature
for 4 hrs.
DSPE-PEG2,000-FAM was prepared by coupling 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N-amino(polyethylene glycol)2,000 (DSPE-PEG2,000-amine) with
NHS-Fluorescein (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) at a 1:1 molar ratio for 1 hr at room
temperature. DSPE-PEG2,000-Cy7 was prepared similarly using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N-amino(polyethylene glycol)2,000 and Cy7-NHS ester (GE
Healthcare, UK).
DSPE-PEG2,000-iRGD(FAM), DSPE-PEG2,000-amine, and DSPE-PEG2,000-Cy7 in 3:6.7:0.3
molar ratios were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v). The solvent was evaporated,
and the dried lipid film was kept under vacuum for 8 hrs and allowed to swell in PBS for 2 hrs
at 60°C. The vial was vortexed and sonicated to produce micelles. The micelles were

sequentially filtered through 0.2 µm and 0.1 µm filters, and washed with sterile PBS to remove
unreacted peptides. Control Cy7 micelles were prepared using DSPE-PEG2,000-FAM in place
of DSPE-PEG2,000-iRGD(FAM). The micelles were 15–25 nm in diameter as measured in
deionized water by dynamic laser light scattering (refractive index, 1.59; viscosity, 0.89) on a
Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Malvern, UK).
Optical in vivo imaging of micelle-peptide conjugates
PDAC mice were injected with 100 µl of 1 mM micelles in PBS. After 3 hrs, the mice were
anesthetized, shaved, and subjected to whole body imaging with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
Immunofluorescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissue sections were processed as described (Karmali et al., 2009). Cells were grown on
collagen I-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) overnight, and incubated with
108 pfu/ml of T7 phage for 30 min. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained
with antibodies and DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The primary antibodies were rat
anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and rabbit anti-human αv integrin
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit anti-human neuropilin-1 (Chemicon), mouse anti-human
neuropilin-1 (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), and rabbit anti-T7 phage (Teesalu et al., 2009)
polyclonal antibodies. The secondary antibodies, Alexa594 goat antibodies to mouse, rat, and
rabbit IgG and Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit antibody were from Molecular Probes. Cells and
tissue sections were examined by a Fluoview 500 confocal microscope (Olympus America,
Center Valley, PA).
In vitro phage binding and penetration assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Suspended cells (106 cells in DMEM containing 1% BSA) were incubated with 108 pfu/ml of
T7 phage for 1 hr at 4°C. The cells were washed 4 times with the binding buffer, lysed with
lysogeny broth containing 1% NP-40, and titrated. Phage penetration assays used the same
procedure, except that the cells were incubated with phage at 37°C, and that an acidic buffer
(500 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 M glycine, 1% BSA, pH 2.5) was substituted for the binding
buffer in the second wash to remove the phage that bound to the cell surface. Inhibitors of
binding and penetration were added 20 min prior to incubation with phage. Non-infectious
phage were prepared by treating phage with UV for 8 min in DMEM containing 1% BSA. The
UV-inactivated phage particles expressing about 200 peptides per particle were used as
multivalent inhibitors. Free synthetic peptides, mouse antibodies against human α1, α2, αvβ3,
αvβ5, α5β1, α4, or αv integrins and integrin subunits (Chemicon), goat anti-rat neuropilin-1
(R&D Systems), with mouse and goat IgG isotype controls (Abcam) were also tested. In some
cases, 109 pfu phage were treated with 50 μg/ml of crystalline trypsin for 5 min at 37°C before
use. The proteolytic reaction was terminated with 5 mg/ml of soy-bean inhibitor.
Flow cytometry
The experiments were performed as described (Sugahara et al., 2003) except that 1 mM of
MgSO4, CaCl2, and MnCl2 were added to the buffer containing the integrin antibodies. The
antibodies were the same as in the cell binding assays, and were detected with an Alexa488
goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). The cells were analyzed with
an EasyCyte Plus System (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA).
FAM-iRGD fragment isolation
PPC1 cells (107 cells in DMEM) were treated with 10 µM carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinylleucinal (MG132; EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) for 30 min at 37°C to inhibit proteasomes,
and incubated with 20 µM of iRGD peptide labeled with FAM at the N-terminus or C-terminus.
Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 December 8.

The cells were washed once with acidic buffer and lysed in MPER (Pierce Biotechnology)
containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN) on ice for 30 min. The sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 rpm. The
supernatant was applied onto an anti-FITC affinity column, and after washing, bound peptides
were eluted with glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. The eluate was subjected to mass spectrometry.
Affinity measurements

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Binding affinities of iRGD and CRGDK to αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins (US Biological,
Swampscott, MA) and to neuropilin-1 (R&D Systems) were quantified by an ELISA by
measuring IC50. First, saturation binding assays were performed. Microtiter wells coated with
5 µg/ml of the purified proteins were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with various
concentrations of biotinylated iRGD or CRGDK peptide in a HEPES-based buffer containing
1 mM of MgSO4 and CaCl2 for integrin binding and PBS for neuropilin-1 binding. After
washing with the same buffer added with 0.01% Tween 20, streptavidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added to the wells and
incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Peptide binding was quantified with 2,2-azino-bis
(3-etylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a substrate. In
subsequent competition studies, microtiter wells coated with the proteins were incubated with
various concentrations of non-labeled test peptides and a biotinylated reporter peptide at a
concentration that gave half maximal binding in the saturation binding assay. After 1 hr
incubation at room temperature, the binding of the biotinylated peptide was quantified as above.
Affinities were determined from the inhibition data as described (Müller, 1980).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Nude mice bearing 22Rv1 orthotopic human prostate tumors were injected intravenously with
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoworms (Park et al., 2009) coated with iRGD or CRGDC
peptides, or untargeted-nanoworms at a dose of 5 mg/kg of iron. Each animal received Niliposomes (0.2 µmol of Ni) intravenously 1 hr prior to the nanoworms to increase the half-life
of the nanoworms (Simberg et al., 2007). The mice were repeatedly imaged before and 3 and
7 hrs after injection of the nanoworms. For each scan, the mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane and repositioned into a 30 mm diameter mouse coil. The axial plains were carefully
matched to previous scans by measuring the height of the sections and comparing the vascular
patterns in the images. Iron sensitive MRI scans consisting of T2-weighted fast spin-echo were
acquired using a 3-Tesla MR imager (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). The conditions used
were; repetition time/echo time = 6.4 s/70 ms, echo train length = 32, readout bandwidth = ±
15.6 kHz, in-plane spatial resolution = 220 µm, field of view = (3.5 cm)2, slice thickness = 1
mm, number of excitation = 3. After imaging, tissues of interest were harvested without
perfusion and processed for immunofluorescence.
Tumor treatment studies
Peptide-conjugated abraxanes were prepared and characterized as described (Karmali et al.,
2009). For in vitro cytotoxicity studies, 22Rv1 or BT474 cells were seeded in 96-well culture
plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and incubated overnight. The cells were incubated with various
concentrations of the conjugates for 30 min at room temperature, and washed with fresh culture
media. MTT assays (Invitrogen) to assess cell viability were performed on the cells 48 hrs
later. For in vivo tumor treatment studies, nude mice bearing 2 week-old 22Rv1 orthotopic
xenografts (typically about 250 mm3 in tumor volume) were intravenously injected with the
abraxane conjugates. The conjugates were given every other day for 14 days at a paclitaxel
equivalent of 3 mg/kg/injection. The iRGD peptide control was administered in an equivalent
amount of iRGD in each iRGD-abraxane dose. Mice bearing subcutaneous 22Rv1 tumors were
treated similarly for 12 days, and orthotopic BT474 tumors for 20 days. The experiments were

terminated according to the guidelines by the Animal Research Committee at the University
of California, Santa Barbara. To study the homing pattern of the abraxane conjugates in the
22Rv1 orthotopic tumors, the conjugates were intravenously injected to tumor bearing mice at
a dose of 3 mg/kg, and allowed to circulate for 3 hrs. The mice were perfused through the heart,
and tissues of interest were harvested and processed for immunofluorescence.
Abraxane quantification
Mice bearing 22Rv1 or BT474 tumors were intravenously injected with the abraxane
conjugates at a paclitaxel equivalent of 9 mg/kg/injection. After 3 hours, the mice were perfused
through the heart, and tissues of interest were harvested. The tissues were homogenized in cold
RIPA buffer (Pierce Biotechnology) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTAfree) and kept on ice for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm.
The abraxane concentration in the supernatant was quantified with an ELISA: abraxane was
captured with a taxol antibody (Novus Biologicals, Litleton, CO) coated onto a 96-well plate
and detected with a human albumin antibody labeled with biotin (US Biological).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by suitable post-hoc test. The details are given in Table S3.

Figure 3. iRGD binds to αv integrins

(A) Quantification of the in vivo distribution of iRGD and control peptides. FAM-iRGD; a
non-integrin-binding iRGD mutant, FAM-CRGEKGPDC (FAM-iRGE); and a FAM-labeled
cyclic polyglycine control peptide, FAM-CG7C were injected into PDAC mice as described
in the legend of Figure 2A. Fluorescence in each tissue was quantified with Image J.
(B) Inhibition of the tumor homing of FAM-iRGD with non-labeled iRGD. A 10-fold excess
of unlabeled iRGD peptide or iRGE peptide was injected 30 min before the injection of FAMiRGD in PDAC mice. Fluorescence was quantified as above. FAM-iRGD homing without
injection of unlabeled peptide was considered as 100%.

Figure 4. Multistep binding and penetration mechanism of iRGD

The iRGD peptide accumulates at the surface of αv integrin-expressing endothelial and other
cells in tumors. The RGD motif mediates the integrin binding. The peptide is cleaved by a cell
surface-associated protease(s) to expose the cryptic CendR element, RXXK/R, at the Cterminus (red dotted line). The CendR element then mediates binding to neuropilin-1, with
resulting penetration of cells and tissues. The peptide can penetrate into tumor cells and tissues
with a cargo, such as a simple chemical or a nanoparticle, provided that the cargo is attached
to the N-terminus of the iRGD peptide because the disulfide bond apparently breaks before the
peptide is internalized (black line).

tumor ducts examined were positive for αv integrins. Tumor cells (arrowheads) and tumor
ducts (asterisks) also strongly positive for neuropilin-1 were particularly effective in
internalizing and retaining FAM-iRGD. Representative images from three independently

Figure 7. Tumor imaging with iRGD-coated iron oxide nanoworms

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

T2-weighted MR images of mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors. The mice
were injected intravenously with iron oxide nanoworms coated with iRGD, CRGDC, or no
peptide (5 mg/kg of iron). Shown are axial images through the tumors acquired by repeated
imaging before the nanoworm injection (Pre-injection) and 3 hrs or 7 hrs after the injection.
The orientation of the tumors is slightly different between the time points because the mice
were anesthetized for each scan and reintroduced in the MRI instrument. Gadolinium (Gd) was
used as a reference for T1 and Feridex (Fe) for T2 imaging agents. Note the wide hypointensity
areas indicating the spreading of iRGD-nanoworms in the tumor interstitium. CRGDCnanoworms only decreased the intensity of tumor vessels, and the untargeted-nanoworms gave
no signal in the tumor. Arrows point to the vasculature. T, tumor; B, urinary bladder. The rightmost panels represent the nanoworm distribution in tumor tissue examined by confocal
microscopy. Green, nanoworms; red, CD31; blue, DAPI. Scale bars = 100 µm. The images are
representative of multiple tumor mice; iRGD-nanoworms, n = 5; CRGDC-nanoworms, n = 3;
untargeted-nanoworms, n = 3.

(A and C) Abraxane quantification in orthotopic 22Rv1 (A) and BT474 (C) xenograft models.
Abraxane was intravenously injected into tumor mice 3 hours earlier and captured from tumor
extracts with a taxol antibody, followed by detection with a human albumin antibody. n = 3
for each group.
(B and D) Long-term treatment of tumor mice with targeted abraxane conjugates. Mice bearing
orthotopic 22Rv1 (B) or BT474 (D) xenografts were intravenously injected with peptide-coated
abraxanes every other day at 3 mg paclitaxel/kg/injection. The treatment was continued for 14
days in (B) and 20 days in (D). Panel (B) shows one of three experiments, which all gave similar
results. The total number of mice in (B) was: untargeted abraxane (ABX, n = 18), abraxane
coated with CRGDC (CRGDC-ABX, n = 10) or iRGD (iRGD-ABX, n = 19), iRGD peptide
alone as a control (iRGD peptide, n = 10), or PBS (n = 18). The number of mice per group was
8 in (D).
Statistical analyses were performed with Student’s t-test in panels (A) and (C), and ANOVA
in panels (B) and (D). Error bars, s.e.m.; n.s., not significant; single asterisk, p < 0.05; double
asterisk, p < 0.01; triple asterisk, p < 0.001.
