Abstract
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is an active component of the
spice turmeric and has a diversity of antitumor activities. In
this study, we found that curcumin can inhibit cancer cell
invasion and metastasis through activation of the tumor
suppressor DnaJ-like heat shock protein 40 (HLJ1). Human
lung adenocarcinoma cells (CL1-5) treated with curcumin
(1–20 Mmol/L) showed a concentration-dependent reduction
in cell migration, invasion, and metastatic ability, and this was
associated with increased HLJ1 expression. Knockdown of
HLJ1 expression by siRNA was able to reverse the curcumininduced anti-invasive and antimetastasis effects in vitro and
in vivo. The HLJ1 promoter and enhancer in a luciferase
reporter assay revealed that curcumin transcriptionally upregulates HLJ1 expression through an activator protein
(AP-1) site within the HLJ1 enhancer. JunD, one of the AP-1
components, was significantly up-regulated by curcumin
(1–20 Mmol/L) in a concentration- and time-dependent
manner. Knockdown of JunD expression could partially
reduce the curcumin-induced HLJ1 activation and diminish
the anti-invasive effect of curcumin, indicating that JunD
would seem to be involved in curcumin-induced HLJ1
expression. Curcumin was able to induce c-Jun NH2-kinase
(JNK) phosphorylation, whereas the JNK inhibitor (SP-600125)
could attenuate curcumin-induced JunD and HLJ1 expression.
Activation of HLJ1 by curcumin further leads to up-regulation
of E-cadherin and a suppression of cancer cell invasion. Our
results show that curcumin induces HLJ1, through activation of
the JNK/JunD pathway, and inhibits lung cancer cell invasion
and metastasis by modulating E-cadherin expression. This is a
novel mechanism and supports the application of curcumin in
anti–cancer metastasis therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7428–38]

angiogenesis, and metastasis (1) through a diversity of signaling
pathways involving nuclear factor-nB, InBa kinase, Akt, activator
protein (AP-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase, cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), lipoxygenase, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, urinary
plasminogen activator, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, cell
surface adhesion molecules, cyclin D1, and others (2–5). Human
clinical trials have indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when
curcumin is administered at doses up to 10 g/day and when the
serum concentration of curcumin was 1.77 F 1.87 Amol/L at the
dose of 8 g/day (6). These studies suggest that curcumin may have
enormous potential in cancer therapy. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms of the drug would enhance the
therapeutic potential of curcumin either alone or in combination
with other anticancer therapy. This might be possible by
synergistically modulating several of the properties of cancer such
as proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. To provide a more global
perspective, we examined the anticancer mechanisms of curcumin
using cDNA microarray mRNA analysis of lung cancer cells and
identified a panel of candidate curcumin target genes (7). Some of
these target genes are highly associated with the cancer invasion
and metastasis (8).
Interestingly, one of the target genes is a heat shock protein
(HSP), HLJ1, also known as DNAJB4, which was recently cloned and
classified as a member of the HSP40 family (HSP40/DnaJ; ref. 9).
HSPs are thought to act as molecular chaperones. They can be
powerfully induced by heat shock and other chemical and physical
stresses in a wide range of species (10, 11). Recently, it has been
found that some HSPs are associated with progression in a variety
of human cancers and may modulate cancer cell proliferation,
differentiation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis (12, 13). Some
HSPs have been suggested as able to serve as diagnostic or
prognostic biomarkers and may also be useful as new targets for
anticancer drug development (14).
The novel candidate target of curcumin, HLJ1, belongs to HSP40
family, which occurs throughout the cell and shows a high diversity
in eukaryotic genomes (15). They are at least 44 genes present in
the human genome (16). We have previously reported that HLJ1 as
able to inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenesis, cell motility, invasion, and cell cycle
progression. High expression of HLJI in tumor specimens is
associated with reduced cancer recurrence and longer overall
survival of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (17). The
endogenous control of HLJ1 transcription in cancer cells is
regulated by transcriptional factor YY1 and AP-1 (18). This new
tumor suppressor and invasion suppressor HLJ1 may be a potential
treatment target for anticancer therapy (19).

Curcumin Inhibits Metastasis through HLJ1

Several lines of evidence have shown that curcumin is able to
inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis (3, 7, 20, 21), and our
previous microarray data suggested that not only the metalloproteinase (MMP) could be affected by curcumin, but also the
tumor suppressor and invasion suppressor HLJ1 may be regulated
by curcumin (7). In this study, we identified that the anti-invasive
and antimetastasis effect of curcumin is mediated by up-regulation
of HLJ1 and curcumin is able to transcriptionally regulated HLJ1
expression through the JNK/JunD pathway and inhibit lung cancer
cell invasion and metastasis by modulating E-cadherin expression.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with less invasive (CL1-0) and
highly invasive capacities (CL1-5) were established previously (22). The
human lung carcinoma cell line, A549 [American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC); CCL-185], was obtained from ATCC. The cells were grown in
DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Life Technologies) and each of penicillin and streptomycin (100 mg/mL
each) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 (7).

Migration Assay
Cancer cell migration was assayed by wound-healing assay and transwell
migration assay as described previously with some modification (7, 17).
The wound-healing assay. The cancer cells were cultured in 24-well
plates and grown in medium containing 10% FBS to nearly confluent cell
monolayer, then carefully scratched using a plastic pipette tip to draw a
linear ‘‘wound’’ in the cell monolayer of each well. The monolayer was
washed twice with PBS to remove debris or the detached cells from
the monolayer, and then curcumin was added by different concentrations
(1, 5, 10, and 20 Amol/L); the control well was added with 0.1% of DMSO as
the solvent control. The cultures were incubated at 37jC and photographed
immediately and monitored by time lapse (photographed per 20 min for
12 h) in the Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200M/COOLSANPfx with Bio-station system
(Carl Zeiss). Under the microscope, the number of cells that migrated into
the cell-free zone, base on the zero line of the linear ‘‘wound,’’ was evaluated.
The experiments were performed thrice in triplicate and were counted
double blind by at least two investigators.
The transwell migration assay. The cancer cell transwell migration
assay was performed according to our previous study and partially modified
(7). Briefly, Transwell membrane (8-Am pore size, 6.5-mm diameter; Corning
Costar Corporation) was used. The CL1-5 cells were trypsinized, washed,
and kept suspended in medium without FBS. To the lower wells of the
chambers, migration-inducing medium (with 10% FBS) were added. Upper
wells were filled with serum-free medium with cells (20,000 cells per well),
in some cases, also containing different concentrations of curcumin (1, 5,
10, and 20 Amol/L) or 0.1% of DMSO as the solvent control. Then, the
chamber was placed into a humidified incubator. After 8 h, assays were
stopped by removal of the medium from the upper wells and careful
removal of the filters. Filters were fixed with methanol by brief submersion
and were subsequently wiped on the cells on the upper side using the Q-tip.
Filters were stained with 20% Giemsa solution (Sigma Chemical) for the
light microscope or 4¶-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for the fluorescent
microscopy–based high content screening system (Cellomics). Evaluation
of completed transmigration was performed under the microscope, and
random fields were scanned ( four fields per filter) for the presence of cells
at the lower membrane side only.

Cancer Cell Invasion Assay
The cancer cell invasive ability with or without indicated treatment was
examined by membrane transwell culture system as described previously
(7). Briefly, Transwell membrane (8-Am pore size, 6.5-mm diameter; Corning
Costar Corporation) coated with Matrigel (2.5 mg/mL; BD Biosciences
Discovery Labware) was used for invasion assay. Cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged, and resuspended at 107 cells/mL in DMEM. Cells were seeded

www.aacrjournals.org

onto the upper wells of precoated transwells, 2  104 cells per well. Lower
wells of the transwells contained the same medium with 10% FBS. After
18 h of incubation, the cells on the upper well and the membranes coated
with Matrigel were swabbed with a Q-tip, fixed with methanol, and stained
with 20% Giemsa solution (Sigma Chemical). The cells that were attached
to the lower surface of the polycarbonate filter were counted under a light
microscope (magnification, 200). The experiments were performed thrice
in triplicate.

In vivo Animal Studies
We perform the in vivo metastasis assay in mice according to the
protocols approved by the National Yang-Ming University Animal Care
and Use Committee. The CL1-5 cells were pretreated with scramble or
HLJ1 siRNA for 24 h and recalculate the cell survival and cell number by
trypan blue; finally, 5  105 live CL1-5 cells in 100 AL PBS were injected
into the tail vein of 8-wk-old severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
mice (supplied by the animal center in the College of Medicine, National
Taiwan University). To examine the effects of curcumin on the cancer
colonization in lung, the mice with scramble or HLJ1 siRNA–treated CL1-5
cells were randomly grouped into curcumin-treated or untreated groups.
Curcumin was suspended in the Propylene Glycol (J.T.Baker) for p.o.
administration and dosed p.o. once daily at 1 g/kg for 5 wk of treatment.
After 5 wk, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed for the lung
colonization. The lungs (or other organs) were rinsed with PBS and then
placed in a beaker containing Bouin’s solution. After 24 h, the lungs were
rinsed in water to remove excess Bouin’s solution and the tumor colonies
were counted under a dissecting microscope and double confirmed under
a microscope in histology by H&E staining and human vimentin
immunostaining.

Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR
The expression level of HLJ1 was detected with real-time PCR on ABI
prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The HLJ1
primers are as follows: forward primer QHLJ1-F, 5¶-CCAGCAGACATTGTTTTTATCATT-3¶; and reverse primer QHLJ1-R, 5¶-CCATCCAGTGTTGGTACATTAATT-3¶. TATA-box binding protein (TBP) was used as the internal
control (Genbank X54993). The primers and probe used for quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of TBP mRNA were as described
previously (23, 24). The relative expression level of HLJ1 compared with that
of TBP was defined as DCT = [CTHLJ1 CTTBP]. The HLJ1 mRNA/TBP
mRNA ratio was calculated as 2 DCT ’ K, in which K is a constant.
Experiments were performed thrice in triplicate.

Western Blot, Immunofluorescent Staining, and Flow
Cytometry
Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the
protein expression levels of HLJ1, c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Fra-1, Fra-2, and
E-cadherin before and after curcumin treatment, whereas, the flow
cytometry was used to confirm the E-cadherin expression in curcumintreated cells. The detailed procedures were as described previously (18).
The primary antibodies for c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra1, and Fra2
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., E-cadherin was
purchased from signaling transduction (BD Biosciences), and primary
antibody for HLJ1 was made in house (16). Monoclonal mouse anti–atubulin (1:500; Calbiochem) was used for loading control. The membranes
were then washed thrice with TBST, followed by incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (1:4,000) in
TBST/2% skim milk. Bound antibody was detected using the Enhanced
Chemiluminescence System. Chemiluminescent signals were captured
using the Fujifilm LAS 3000 system (Fujifilm). All experiments were
performed at least thrice in duplicate.
FITC-conjugated second antibody (Biotech, Inc.) was used for immunofluorescent staining. Propidium iodide was used as counter staining for cell
nuclei. The stained cells were then examined by a confocal laser scanning
microscope (C1si; Nikon) at 400 magnifications. The cells stained with
E-cadherin antibody, and FITC-conjugated second antibody were analyzed
by flow cytometry (Beckman-Coulter; EPICS-XL). Experiments were
performed thrice in triplicate.

HLJ1 Promoter and Enhancer and Luciferase Reporter Gene
Constructs
To clone the putative promoter and/or enhancer region of the HLJ1 gene,
a PCR-based method was used and specific primers were designed from the

5¶-end of the known HLJ1 promoter sequence from our previous study
(25) and from the bioinformatic search in Genbank. The amplified DNA
fragment of 2,302 bp was cloned into the promoterless pGL3-Basic vector
(Promega) to construct pGL3-FRER’ as from the previous study (25).

Figure 1. Curcumin inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion in CL1-5 cells. A, the wound-healing assay for evaluating the inhibitory effects of curcumin on
CL1-5 cell migration. Confluent monolayers of CL1-5 cells were scarred, and repair was monitored microscopically after 12 h of treatment with curcumin (5–20 Amol/L).
The cells migrating into the wound area were counted based on the dash line as time zero. The representative photographs showed the same area at time zero and after
12 h of incubation with or without curcumin. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, statistically significantly compared with the vehicle-treated control.
These results are representative of three independent experiments. B, the Transwell migration assay showed the inhibitory effects of curcumin on CL1-5 cell migration.
After 8 h of incubation with or without the indicated concentration of curcumin, cells that migrate to the lower chamber were fixed, stained, and counted using light
microscopy or flurescent microscopy–based high content screening system, as describe in Materials and Methods. Random fields were scanned (four fields per
filter of the well) for the presence of cells on the lower side of the membrane. Columns, mean of the migrated cells from three independent experiments and three wells
per experiment; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, statistically significant. C, the effect of curcumin treatment on cell invasion was determined using the Matrigel Invasion Assay
System. CL1-5 cells in serum-free medium with or without curcumin were seeded into the upper chamber of the system. The bottom well was filled with complete
medium. After 16 h of incubation, the cells that had invaded through the Matrigel membrane were stained with 20% Giemsa solution and counted under a light
microscope (magnification, 200). The experiments were performed thrice in triplicate. Columns, mean of invasive cell number from three independent experiments;
bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, statistically significant.

Curcumin Inhibits Metastasis through HLJ1
According to our previous works, varying lengths of the 5¶-flanking region
of the HLJ1 gene for luciferase assays were generated (17, 25). The pGL3Control, a positive control plasmid, was also obtained from Promega. The
putative enhancer ( 2,125 to 1,039) element and its various deletion
mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGL3-promoter
vector as our previous study described (25). This vector contains the
luciferase gene driven by SV40 promoter. The same cloning strategy was

used to generate the minimal enhancer construct pGL3-p-Emi. For sitedirected mutagenesis assay, the pGL3-p-Emi construct served as a
template for the generation of mutations in the SP1 and AP-1 binding
sites. All mutant constructs were prepared by PCR using appropriate
primers containing the mutations. The composition of all of the
constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and
DNA sequencing.

Figure 2. Curcumin (cur ) induces HLJ1 expression and inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion. A, real-time quantitative RT-PCR reveals that HLJ1 mRNA
expression was induced by curcumin in a concentration-dependent manner (1–20 Amol/L) after 24 h incubation. B, concentration-dependent and time course–
dependent curcumin-induced HLJ1 expression at the protein level were confirmed by Western blotting analysis. The results indicated that the protein level of HLJ1 was
significantly increased after curcumin (10 Amol/L) treatment for 12 to 24 h. The expression levels were qualified by densitometer and calculated relative to the
expression level of a-tubulin (as the internal control) and are shown as the mean expression levels from three independent experiments; columns, mean (n = 3);
bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, statistically significantly compared with vehicle-treated control. C, Western blotting showed the HLJ1 expression levels of HLJ1 siRNA or
scrambled siRNA–transfected (control) CL1-5 cells with or without curcumin treatment. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments with a-tubulin
used as the internal control. HLJ1 protein expression was reduced by HLJ1 siRNA both in the base level and curcumin-treated cells (lane 3 and 4 ), whereas there was
no effect within the scrambled siRNA control group (lane 5 and 6 ). Bottom, the HLJ1 knockdown specifically reduced the anti-invasive activity of curcumin. Cells
transfected with control or HLJ1 siRNA were treated with or without curcumin and then tested in invasion assays across a Transwell membrane coated with Matrigel.
Columns, mean derived from three separate experiments done in quadruplicate; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. D, the tail vein assay of cancer metastasis was used to
examine the role of HLJ1 in the antimetastatic effects of curcumin in vivo . CL1-5 cells transfected with scrambled RNA or HLJ1 siRNA were injected into tail vein
of the SCID mice (5  105 cells per mice, at least 6 mice for each group). The curcumin-treated groups were orally treated with curcumin (1 g/kg/day). Five weeks later,
the numbers of pulmonary tumor nodules were examined by staining with Bouin’s solution. The tissue sections were stained with H&E and immunostaining with human
vimentin. Columns, mean (n > 6); bars, SD. **, P < 0.05, statistically significant compared with vehicle-treated control; *, P < 0.05, statistically significant compared with
the scramble control.

Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays
All transfections were performed in triplicate in 6-well plates, and the
detail protocol was described in previous studies (18, 25). In brief, CL1-5 cells
(f2  105 cells per well) were seeded for 24 h prior to transfection. Plasmids
were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The HLJ1 promoter and
enhancer luciferase reporter constructs (25), along with the control plasmid,
was cotransfected with a h-galactosidase construct, pSV-h-Gal (Promega).
The ratio of the DNA amounts for luciferase reporter constructs versus hgalactosidase construct was 3:1. The cells were incubated in transfection
mixture for 4 h and then harvested after 44 h in culture. An aliquot of cell
lysate (10–25 AL) was used to assay luciferase activity using a luciferase assay
kit (Tropix, Inc.). Another aliquot (10–25 AL) was used to measure hgalactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent assay kit
(Tropix, Inc.). Luminescence was measured with a Victor2 1420 Multilabel
Counter (Wallac). Transfection efficiency was normalized with h-gal activity.
Each experiment was repeated at least thrice.

Actin Staining
Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde-PBS
solution for 10 min at room temperature. After two additional washes with
PBS, cells were permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3
to 5 min and washed again with PBS. Phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine
isothiocyanate (0.2 Ag/mL) and Alexa Fluor 488 DNase I conjugate (9 Ag/mL)
were used to localize filamentous actin (F-actin) and G-actin, respectively, as
described by Cramer and colleagues (26). Fluorescent dyes were diluted on
blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.025% saponin in PBS) and
added to coverslips for 40 min at room temperature. After three washes with
PBS, coverslips were mounted on a microscopy slide with mounting media
(Vector Laboratories). Time of image acquisition and image intensity gain
were optimally adjusted and kept constant for all experiments. F-actin to
G-actin fluorescence ratio was quantified using fields containing >30 cells
imaged with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE2000; Nikon)
and a 12-bit resolution cooled charge-coupled device camera (Orca;
Hamamatsu Photonics) at 10 magnification as previously report (27).
F-actin cytoskeleton imaging was performed with a confocal laser scanning
microscope (C1si; Nikon) at 400 magnifications.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate and analyzed by ANOVA
(Excel; Microsoft) for significant differences. P values of <0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Where appropriate, the data are
presented as the mean F SD.

Results
Curcumin inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion. CL1-5
is a highly invasive cancer cell line both in vitro and in vivo (22).
Due to the fact that curcumin could induce cell apoptosis and
reduce cell viability as the concentrations of curcumin over
20 Amol/L (the IC50 is 33.2 F 3.7 Amol/L in CL1-5 cells; ref. 7), the
effects of curcumin on migration and invasion abilities of CL1-5
cells were performed at the concentration range below 20 Amol/L
and determined by the wound-healing assay, the Transwell
migration model, and the Matrigel-based Transwell invasion assay.
Concentration dependently, curcumin (5–20 Amol/L) was able to
significantly inhibit CL1-5 cancer cell migration, and this effect was
consistent across both the wound-healing and transwell migration
models (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, the Matrigel-based transwell
assay indicated that curcumin was able to inhibit cell invasion
(Fig. 1C). Similar results whereby curcumin inhibited cell migration
and invasion were confirmed for another invasive lung cancer cell
line, A549 (data not shown), indicating that this observation would
seem to be neither cell specific nor a coincidence.
Suppression of cancer cell invasion and metastasis by
curcumin is associated with up-regulation of HLJ1. To elucidate

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

the anti-invasion and antimetastasis mechanisms of curcumin,
curcumin-regulated differentially expressed genes in CL1-5 cells
were profiled in our previous study (7), and some of these genes
are highly correlated with the invasive ability of cancer cells (8).
Herein, one curcumin-regulated tumor suppressor and invasion
suppressor gene HLJ1 (17) is examined. As shown in Fig. 2, we
confirmed that curcumin was able to increase both the mRNA and
protein expression levels of HLJ1 in CL1-5 cells in a concentrationand time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A–B).
To evaluate the importance of HLJ1 in the anti-invasive effect of
curcumin in CL1-5 cells, a specific siRNA for HLJ1 was used to
knockdown HLJ1 expression in curcumin-treated cells. We found
that HLJ1 expression decreased after 24 hours of 20 nmol/L HLJ1
siRNA treatment; furthermore, the effect of curcumin-induced
HLJ1 expression was also reduced by 67% F 7.2% compared with
curcumin-treated group by HLJ1 siRNA (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C). In the
same experiment, the anti-invasive effect of curcumin was reversed
by pretreated with HLJ1 siRNA (Fig. 2C). These results showed that
51.4% F 8.7% of cancer cell invasion could be inhibited by
curcumin and that this effect was reduced to 20.1% F 12.6% if cells
were preincubated with HLJ1 siRNA before curcumin treatment.
On the other hand, the scrambled siRNA control showed no
difference compared with the control group.
To examine the role of HLJ1 in the antimetastatic effects of
curcumin in vivo, the i.v. experimental lung metastasis model in
SCID mice was used. CL1-5 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA
(mock) or HLJ1 siRNA were counted (5  105 cells) and injected into
tail vein of the SCID mice. These mice were then treated with or
without curcumin (p.o., 1 g/kg/day). After 5 weeks, the numbers of
colonized pulmonary tumor nodules were counted. Most of the
pulmonary tumor colonies in the mice were found near or on the
surface of the lungs (Fig. 2D). The data showed that injection with
mock cancer cells could result 21.80 F 13.84 pulmonary colonized
tumor nodule formation per mice. The curcumin-treated group
showed a significantly reduced number of the colonized tumor
nodules in the lungs compared with the mock control group (3.89 F
2.28 nodules per mice; P < 0.05). The knockdown HLJ1 was able to
attenuate the antimetastatic effects of curcumin in vivo as shown by
the fact that the HLJ1 siRNA–transfected plus curcumin-treated
group showed many nodules (11.78 nodules per mice) compared
with the scrambled siRNA plus curcumin-treated group (3.89
nodules per mice). These results indicated that HLJ1 would seem
to play a role in the antimetastasis effects of curcumin.
The AP-1 site within the HLJ1 enhancer and the JNK/JunD
signaling pathway are responsible for HLJ1 up-regulation by
curcumin. We have previously identified that the YY1 and AP-1
binding sites in the HLJ1 promoter and enhancer regions play a
major role in HLJ1 transcriptional regulation (18, 25). To study
whether curcumin could regulate HLJ1 expression through the
promoter and/or enhance regions of HLJ1, several constructs with
deletions or mutations were used and have been previously
described in detail (25). The full length of the HLJ1 promoter with
enhancer construct (PGL3-FRER’) was used to show that curcumin
could concentration-dependently induce luciferase activity (Fig. 3A),
whereas curcumin has less effect on the promoter only construct
(PGL3-F2RER’). Interestingly, curcumin was able to significantly
increase the luciferase activity of the minimum enhancer region
(Emi-F/R; data not shown), which contains the AP-1 and SP-1
binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the AP-1 site
( 1,457 to 1,451) and not the SP-1 site was essential for the
curcumin-regulated HLJ1 enhancer region activity (Fig. 3B). There

are several protein components that make up the AP-1 complex,
including c-Jun, c-Fos, JunD, JunB, Fra-1, and Fra-2. On studying the
effects of curcumin on the AP-1 subunit family, we found that only
JunD was able to be significantly induced by curcumin in CL1-5 cells
(Fig. 3C). In contrast to c-jun, which was shown to be slightly downregulated, JunB shows an ascending trend, whereas Fra-1, Fra-2, and

studies showed that the dynamic effects of curcumin during the
induction of JunD expression occurred after 2 hours of incubation at
the mRNA level and after 4 hours at protein level. This is just a little
earlier than the induction of HLJ1 expression in curcumin-treated
cells (Fig. 3D).
To confirm the role of JunD in curcumin-induced HLJ1
expression, JunD siRNA was applied to curcumin-treated CL1-5
cells to knock down JunD expression. The Fig. 4A showed that

whereas no effect was detected in the scrambled siRNA control groups (lane 5 and 6 ). The sample preparations of the cells transfected with control or HLJ1 siRNA with

pretreatment with JunD siRNA was able to reduce curcumininduced HLJ1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4A). This effect was confirmed
at the protein levels for JunD and HLJ1 by Western blot analysis as
shown in Fig. 4B. In the same preparation, the anti-invasive effect of
curcumin was reduced by pretreatment with JunD siRNA (Fig. 4B).
To further investigate the regulation of curcumin on the JunD upstream modulator, c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) and phosphorylation of
JNK were examined (Fig. 4C). The data showed that two isoforms of
JNK, JNK1, and JNK2 were both expressed in CL1-5 cells and were
not affected by curcumin treatment. The phospho-form of JNK1 and
JNK2, p-JNK1 and p-JNK2, were significantly induced by curcumin

with dynamic changes (Fig. 4C). This contrasts with the effect of the
JNK inhibitor (SP600125), which was able to reduce the effects of
curcumin-induced JunD and HLJ1 expression in CL1-5 cells (Fig.
4D). These results showed that JNK phosphorylation and JunD
would seem to be involved in the curcumin-induced HLJ1 signaling
pathway in CL1-5 cells.
Curcumin up-regulates HLJ1 and E-cadherin expression,
suppresses filopodia formation, and inhibits cancer cell
invasion. The question remains as to how curcumin-induced
HLJ1 expression is able to affect cancer cell invasion. Our previous
study suggested that HLJ1 was able to inhibit cell invasion through

the induction of E-cadherin expression (18), and other evidence has
suggested that these DnaJ-like proteins might interact with actin,
tubulin, or various intermediate filaments to restrict cellular
activity (28). Immunostaining of curcumin-treated CL1-5 cells
showed that there was up-regulation and localization of E-cadherin
into the cell-cell junctions together with a mesenchymal-epithelial
phenotype transition (Fig. 5A). Western blot and flow cytometry
analysis confirmed that the E-cadherin protein levels are upregulated by curcumin in a concentration-dependent manner
(5–20 Amol/L; Fig. 5B and C). HLJ1 siRNA was able to specifically
knockdown HLJ1 protein levels and this significantly diminished
curcumin-induced E-cadherin expression (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D).
Because HLJ1, such as other DnaJ family members, might
modulate cell invasion through regulating the kinetics of actin,
tubulin, or various other intermediate filaments (28), we examined
the effects of curcumin on actin polymerization. As shown in
Fig. 6A, curcumin did not significantly affect the total amount of
actin. However, the F-actin (polymer)/G-actin (monomer) ratio
was significantly decreased by curcumin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Figure 6C shows that
curcumin also decreased cell membrane filopodia protrusions
and induced an abnormal aggregation of actins in cytosol of the
curcumin-treated cells (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Curcumin has long been known to act as a therapeutic or
preventive agent for several major human cancers by regulating a
variety of antitumor signaling pathways (29, 30). In this study, we
have confirmed that curcumin can inhibit the invasion and
metastasis of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that

curcumin can suppress cancer cell invasion and metastasis through
the up-regulation of the tumor suppressor HLJ1. Curcumin is able
to transcriptionally activate HLJ1 expression through the JNK/JunD
pathway. Activation of HLJ1 by curcumin further leads to upregulation of E-cadherin, and this inhibits cancer cell invasion and
metastasis. Our results strengthen the potential of curcumin as a
multitarget drug in anticancer therapy (1, 31, 32).
The emerging concept of integrating gene expression profiles
after small molecule treatment of specific diseases has been
suggested to be an effective strategy for the identification the new
drug development targets (33). We have previously generated two
cDNA microarray data sets: namely the cancer invasion/metastasis
associated gene data set obtained from cell lines with different
invasive abilities (CL1-0 to CL1-5; ref. 8) and the curcuminregulated gene expression signature data set (7). By combining and
sorting the curcumin-regulated genes and the invasion/metastasisassociated genes from these two data sets, the tumor suppressor
HLJ1 was one of the selected candidate targets for control of
metastasis and invasion. This was further confirmed in this study,
which showed that HLJ1 is a potential new treatment target for the
control cancer cell invasion by curcumin. These results are
consistent with our previous study and support the hypothesis
that the tumor suppressor HLJ1 is an important target for antiinvasion, antimetastasis, and antiangiogenesis in cancer therapy
(17, 19). Our findings help to shed some light on the development
of new drugs such as curcumin analogues that may inhibit cancer
invasion and metastasis by targeting HLJ1.
A previous study showed HLJ1 to be regulated by AP-1 through the
enhancer region of HLJ1 (18, 25). The AP-1 transcription factor
complex, composed mainly of Jun-Jun and Jun-Fos protein dimer,

E-cadherin were quantified by densitometer. The bar chart shows relative expression levels of E-cadherin/a-tubulin and HLJ1/a-tubulin with or without curcumin (10 and

is involved in various biological processes, including normal cell
growth and cancer development (34). Curcumin has been suggested
to inhibit tumor growth through an inhibition of AP-1 activation
(35). However, in this study, we found that curcumin significantly
and concentration-dependently induced JunD expression and it
could positively enhance the promoter activity of HLJ1 via AP-1
binding site. JunD is a versatile AP-1 component and is diverse from
other AP-1 components in transcription regulation and cellular

function (36). Previous evidence has shown that AP-1 complexes
enriched with c-Jun and JunB may result in morphologic alterations
and anchorage-independent cell growth, whereas complexes
enriched with JunD had an antiproliferative effect (37). The
induction of JunD by curcumin has also been reported in a previous
study, which showed that curcumin exposure could up-regulate
JunD expression and may lead to an increase in the enzymes
involved in glutathione synthesis in HBE1 cells (38), the other JunD

Curcumin Inhibits Metastasis through HLJ1

downstream gene, ferritin H mRNA expression, can be transcriptionally regulated by curcumin (36, 39). JunB and JunD are able to
bind to the putative AP-1 site in the HLJ1 enhancer and the
expression of HLJ1 is positively correlated with JunB and JunD
expression in a dose-dependent manner (25). Therefore, we suggest
that HLJ1 may be regulated by curcumin through JunD induction
and that this curcumin-induced JunD expression may have the
tumor suppressor–like effects. This hypothesis is further supported
by other recent studies, which have shown that specific AP-1
proteins, such as Fra-1, c-Fos, JunB and JunD, have tumor suppressor
activity and that these effects depend on the antagonistic activities
of the different Jun proteins, the tumor type, the tumor stage, and the
genetic background (25, 34, 40). Previous evidences showed that the
regulation of JunD expression diverges from the well-characterized
growth factor-inducible pattern of the c-jun early response genes
and AP-1 autoregulation (36). Herein, we report that curcumin might
regulate HLJ1 through modulating the JunD composition of the AP-1
transcription factor complex. Indeed, more studies are needed to
clarify the AP-1 dimerization pattern and the activation of specific
tumor suppressors in different cells and tissues.
E-cadherin, as the key component for adherence junctions
between epithelial cells, has been investigated for its roles in
tumorigenesis and as an invasion suppressor molecule in
carcinoma cells (41). E-cadherin has also been suggested to be
involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process associated
with loss of cell-cell adhesion and epithelial polarity during cancer
development and progression (42). Tumor cells with limited
E-cadherin expression are more likely to detach from a tumor
mass, resulting in a poor prognosis. This has been suggested to be
an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC survival (41, 43). Our
previous study indicated that HLJ1 might regulate cell invasion
through E-cadherin (18), and herein, we have confirmed that
curcumin is able to regulate E-cadherin expression in the previous
finding (44); furthermore, we have also identified that this effect
would seem to be at least partly mediated through HLJ1 and results
in an inhibition of cancer cell invasion.
In this study, we found that the curcumin-treated cells showed a
higher level of HLJ1 expression with a decreased F/G actin ratios
and an aggregation of actins. Although, some HSPs have been
suggested to be involved in cytoskeleton arrangement and play
important roles in cell growth and motility regulations. For
example, the major components of the intermediate filaments of
simple epithelia, keratins 8/18, have been reported to directly bind
with Mrj, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein (28). Our previous study
found that the Hsp40-like protein, HLJ1, Hsp27, and Hsp70 were

significantly increased by curcumin (7). These results suggest that
the HSPs may play a role and can explain some pharmacologic
effects of curcumin. Although we did find the actin polymerization
was affected by curcumin, whether this event was HLJ1 dependent
or independent still need to be evaluated.
The key finding of this study is that it provides evidence
supporting the idea that curcumin is able to up-regulate the
expression of the tumor suppressor HLJ1 by transcriptionally
activating its enhancer. This indicates that the anti-invasive and
antimetastasis effects of curcumin are likely to be mediated through
the induction of HLJ1, at least in part. Figure 6D summarizes our
hypothetical signaling pathways for curcumin, its regulation of HLJ1
expression, and its inhibition of cancer cell invasion. Furthermore,
curcumin is able to increase JunD expression, stimulate HLJ1
enhancer activity, and trigger the expression of HLJ1, which would
seem to subsequently reduce filopodia formation and up-regulate Ecadherin expression. These effects ought to restrain cancer cells
from invasion and metastasis.
Based on the molecular heterogeneity and complexity of the
signaling pathways involved in cancer development, multiple
targets therapy may be a winning strategy for anticancer treatment
(19, 29). According to this study and our previous findings,
curcumin could inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion, not
only through the HLJ1/E-cadherin induction, but also involve the
inhibition of MMP14 mRNA and protein expression, as well as the
enzyme activities of MMP2 and MMP9 (7). These evidences
strengthen the possibility for that curcumin may have the potential
as a multitarget drug in anticancer therapy because this drug is able
to target diverse mechanisms involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis,
angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (1, 29–32). This study further
suggests that curcumin may be a template for new antitumor drug
developments that are able to target the tumor suppressor HLJ1.
