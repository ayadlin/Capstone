BACKGROUND: Sunitinib and sorafenib are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with antitumor
activity in advanced renal cell carcinoma. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the response of
renal cell carcinoma to sequential treatment with these two agents. METHODS: Tumor response was evaluated by using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in patients failing first-line
therapy with either sunitinib or sorafenib and subsequently receiving second-line therapy with the other
TKI agent. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients received sorafenib followed by sunitinib (Group A), and 20
patients received sunitinib followed by sorafenib (Group B). TKI drugs were terminated in 6 (12%) patients
in Group A and 4 (8%) in Group B because of toxicity. Median duration of stable disease for Groups A and
B was 20 and 9.5 weeks, respectively. Median time from starting first TKI to disease progression after second TKI (time to progression) in Groups A and B was 78 and 37 weeks, respectively. Multivariate analysis
revealed that Group B had a shorter time to progression than Group A (risk ratio [RR] 3.0; P ¼.016). Median
overall survival was 102 and 45 weeks in Groups A and B, respectively (P ¼.061). CONCLUSIONS: The longer duration of disease control in patients who received sorafenib followed by sunitinib warrants further

Targeted therapies using sorafenib and sunitinib have recently been approved for use as orally administered agents for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Sorafenib is reserved primarily for
patients who are refractory to cytokine therapy,1 whereas sunitinib is used for the treatment of cytokinenaive patients.2 Although sorafenib and sunitinib have significantly improved the treatment of this disease,
the efficacy of sequencing these agents as a treatment for metastatic disease is unknown.
Both sorafenib and sunitinib are multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), although each has distinct affinities for target kinases and distinct pharmacokinetics.3,4 Sorafenib is a potent Raf kinase inhibitor

that directly suppresses tumor cell proliferation; it also
targets vascular growth through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-2 (IC50, 90
nmol/L), VEGFR-3 (IC50, 20 nmol/L) and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-b (IC50, 57
nmol/L).3 Sunitinib is an inhibitor of c-KIT, FLT-3,
PDGF-a (IC50, 69 nmol/L), PDGF-b (IC50, 39 nmol/L),
and VEGFR-2 (IC50, 4 nmol/L).4 Inhibition of VEGF
and PDGF pathways decreases vascularization and endothelial cell proliferation and prevents tumor progression.
Compared with sorafenib, sunitinib has lower IC50s for
kinases involved in angiogenesis.
In clinical practice, sorafenib and sunitinib are both
used as first-line and second-line treatments for renal cell
carcinoma. When patients fail therapy with 1 agent, the
other agent is often used, resulting in de facto sequential
treatment. Scientific data supporting this practice are limited and mainly derive from single-agent studies. Sorafenib has shown efficacy in a phase 3 trial for treatmentrefractory renal cell carcinoma patients, with progression
free survival (PFS) nearly doubling compared with placebo controls (5.5 vs 2.8 months; P < .01).1 Data supporting the use of sorafenib in a first-line setting, however,
are limited. Results of a randomized phase 2 study of sorafenib versus interferon in a first-line setting showed no
differences in PFS or response rate between study arms.5
Sunitinib has been evaluated as a second-line treatment in
a phase 2 trial, and this drug was found to produce a median overall survival (OS) of 16.4 months and a median
PFS of 8.7 months.6 In treatment-naive patients, sunitinib has been compared with interferon-alpha (IFN-a) in a
randomized phase 3 trial in which the median PFS was
reported to be 11 months for sunitinib versus 5 months
for IFN-a (P < .001).2 In patients who failed to respond
to prior antiangiogenic therapy, both sorafenib and sunitinib have been reported to have antitumor activity against
advanced renal cell carcinoma, with an overall median
time to progression of 10.4 months.7 However, little is
known about the optimal sequential treatment strategy.
In the present study, we hypothesized that because
of lower IC50 for the receptor kinases targeted by sunitinib, drug resistance that emerged after initial use of
sorafenib would be overcome by sunitinib, whereas development of resistance to initial sunitinib would not be salvaged by sorafenib. We, therefore, performed a
retrospective chart review to compare the efficacy meas62

ured by time to progression of sequential therapy with sorafenib followed by sunitinib, versus sunitinib followed by
sorafenib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Eligibility
A retrospective analysis was performed on all renal cell
carcinoma patients treated with sunitinib and sorafenib
between March 2004 and October 2007 at the University
of Minnesota Comprehensive Cancer Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at the Department of Clinical Oncology, Central Clinical Hospital Ministry of National
Defense in Warsaw, Poland. The purpose of this analysis
was to evaluate the effectiveness of switching from one
TKI agent to another after disease progression (either after
initial response or outright progression after first 2 cycles)
or toxicity.
At both institutions, all screened patients were at
least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed renal
cell carcinoma. All renal cell carcinoma patients were
screened for inclusion in this analysis when they had experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after
receiving either sorafenib or sunitinib, and then these
patients were subsequently switched to the other TKI
agent. Standard doses of both sorafenib and sunitinib
were used, with a 28-day sorafenib cycle and a 42-day
sunitinib cycle. Clinical response was assessed by using
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
at the first evaluation and then once every 2 cycles. The
chest, abdomen, and pelvis were imaged with a computed
tomography (CT) scan or by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), when appropriate. There was no fixed number of
cycles for each agent. The number of cycles of therapy was
limited only by drug toxicity or disease progression. For
purposes of this chart review, patients who received sorafenib as their initial treatment were identified as Group A,
and patients who received sunitinib as their initial treatment were identified as Group B. The University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board approved the study.

Statistical Methods
Patient characteristics and risk factors were summarized
separately for the 2 sequence groups, Group A and Group
B. A Comparison between treatment groups was performed by using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test for
age. Time to progression was determined for the initial
treatment and also for sequential treatment. Time to progression after initial treatment with either sorafenib or
sunitinib was calculated as the time from the start of treatment until date of progression or toxicity. Time to progression after sequential treatment was calculated as the
time from the start of the first agent to the time that progression, toxicity, or end of follow-up occurred after the
start of the second agent. The median time to progression
for both time periods was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method. Subjects that withdrew from treatment because
of adverse drug reactions or ended the study period without progression were censored.
Univariate analysis included the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time to progressin and the log-rank test
for each variable. The Cox proportional hazards model
was used to evaluate time to progression by using a combination of risk factors present before initial TKI therapy
and resulting in relative risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) that were adjusted for other factors
in the model. The significance of each variable in the
model was evaluated by the Wald chi-square test, and all
significant risk factors in the Cox regression models were
checked for the proportional hazard assumption by using
the interaction between the factor and the log of the event
time.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival were
compared with therapy groups by using the log rank test.
All statistical procedures were performed by SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). P values less than .05 were
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Forty-nine patients were included in this retrospective
chart review (Table 1). Group A (sorafenib followed by
sunitinib) included 29 patients and Group B (sunitinib
followed by sorafenib) included 20 patients. The majority
of patients had clear cell histology (25 in Group A and 16
in Group B). In Group A, there were 2 patients with the
sarcomatoid type and 2 patients with the granular variant
of renal cell carcinoma. In Group B, there were 3 patients
with sarcomatoid and 1 with papillary renal cell carcinoma. All patients had a prior nephrectomy, with the
exception of 1 patient in Group A. The distribution of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic
scores was comparable between groups. Median age was
62 years and 58.5 years for Groups A and B, respectively.
In Group A, 16 patients had prior interferon, interleukin-2, or a combination of both; 1 patient was also
treated with an m-TOR inhibitor. In Group B, 16
patients had been treated earlier with interferon, interleukin-2, or a combination of both. In Group A, there were

10 patients with a history of kidney cancer longer than 12
months in duration from time of diagnosis to start of sorafenib therapy; 9 of these had previously been treated with
interferon, interleukin-2, or a combination of both. In
Group B, there were 15 patients with a history of kidney
cancer longer than 12 months in duration from time of diagnosis to start of sunitinib therapy; all of these had previously been treated with interferon, interleukin-2, or a
combination of both.
Median time between ending first-line therapy and
starting the second agent was 2 days (range, 1 day to 388
days) in Group A and 8 days (range, 1 day to 77 days) in
Group B.
Treatment Toxicities and Response Rates
Patients experienced the expected toxicities associated
with sorafenib and sunitinib treatment. Sorafenib treatment was terminated mainly because of grade 3 skin rash
in 6 (14%) patients, and 3 of these were taken off sorafenib during first-line therapy. Sunitinib treatment was terminated mainly because of grade 3 gastrointestinal
toxicities (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) in 4 (10%)
patients, and 2 of these were taken off sunitinib during
first-line therapy.
Table 2 lists response rates for first and second
agents in both treatment groups. In patients treated first
with sunitinib, there was 1 documented partial response
as defined by RECIST criteria and 13 patients with stable
disease. In patients treated first with sorafenib, there were
2 documented partial responses and 18 patients with stable disease. For sequential treatment, 6 (21%) patients in
Group A had an objective partial response; 11 patients
had stable disease, of which 6 continued to have stable
64

disease at the time of last follow-up. Only 1 (5%) patient
in Group B had an objective partial response after tumor
resection in which sunitinib and sorafenib were given preoperatively, and 5 patients continued to have stable
disease at the time of last follow-up.
Time to Progression After Initial Treatment
Time to progression for patients who were treated with
sunitinib (Group B) as a first agent was 25 weeks. Time to
progression for patients treated with sorafenib (Group A)
as a first agent was 22 weeks. This difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .299). According to univariate
analysis (Table 3), time to progression was not significantly associated with any risk factors, with the exception
of prior cytokine therapy. In multivariate Cox regression
analysis, time to progression after initial treatment with
sunitinib or sorafenib was not associated with any risk factor after adjusting for other factors in the model (Table 4).
Time to Progression and Overall Survival
After Sequential Treatment
Sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by sunitinib
(Group A) resulted in a trend toward improved time to
progression (P ¼ .115) (Fig. 1), suggesting that this drug
administration sequence is associated with better overall
disease control. Group A had a median time to progression of 78 weeks, which is more than twice as long as the
37 weeks seen for Group B (Table 5). Multivariate analysis confirmed this result by revealing that Group B had a
significantly shorter time to progression than Group A
after adjusting for other risk factors, with a risk ratio (RR)
of 3.0 (P ¼ .016) (Table 6). Patients with poor versus

good or intermediate prognostic factors had higher risk of
disease progression (RR, 6.3; P ¼ .008) (Table 6). In
addition, patients who had a partial response or stable disease during initial treatment had a slightly lower risk of
disease progression during sequential therapy (RR, 0.3;
P ¼ .011) (Table 6). None of the significant factors violated the proportional hazard assumption, including the
treatment group. Therefore, the risk associated with the
treatment sequence was consistent over time.
The median time to progression after the second
treatment was 46.9 weeks for those switching to the other
agent because of toxicity of first-line therapy and 67.0
weeks for those switching because of disease progression

DISCUSSION
Herein, we show that responses can be seen in second-line
TKI therapy after first-line TKI failure. In this retrospective analysis of advanced renal cell carcinoma, patients
who received sequential therapy, treatment with sunitinib
after sorafenib failure provided more durable disease control than the reverse order. Indeed, this difference in overall disease control was maintained even after other factors,
including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic grade, were taken into consideration. In addition to
the small sample size of the present retrospective study, we
recognize that the observed differences between the
groups could be due to a higher potency of sunitinib salvage therapy. Moreover, although the 2 drugs have never
directly been compared prospectively in a first-line setting, the level of evidence supporting the use of sunitinib
as frontline therapy is superior to that of sorafenib. Nevertheless, the extent of the differences between these 2
sequences in our study raises important questions related
to the optimal treatment schema for patients with renal
cell carcinoma and the maximization of treatment benefit
when using targeted agents.
66

FIGURE 2. Overall survival is shown.

At present, there are limited data to support specific
guidelines for using targeted agents after disease progression on prior antiangiogenic regimens. Patients who had
failed prior antiangiogenic therapy with thalidomide,
lenalidomide, bevacizumab, volociximab, AG13736, sorafenib, or sunitinib responded to subsequent treatment
with either sorafenib or sunitinib.7 Tamaskar et al7 concluded that response to prior therapy does not appear to
predict subsequent clinical benefit to either sunitinib or
sorafenib. In that study, only 4 patients received the
sequence of sorafenib followed by sunitinib, and only 5
patients received the sequence of sunitinib followed by
sorafenib. In addition, a recent report demonstrated that
sunitinib can be effective in bevacizumab-refractory renal
cell carcinoma patients.9
Differential tumor response to antiangiogenic
agents can possibly be explained by different molecular
targets or differential affinity for target interaction. In the
present study, our data are consistent with the hypothesis
that drug resistance emerging after initial use of sorafenib
would be overcome by sunitinib, whereas development of
resistance to initial sunitinib would not be salvaged by sorafenib. This effect may be related to a lower IC50 for the
angiogenic receptor kinases that sunitinib targets. Minor
differences in molecular targets between sorafenib and
sunitinib could explain responses to sorafenib after sunitinib failure. Sablin et al10 have reported progression-free
survival rates comparable to our study. In their retrospective analysis, 68 patients who received sorafenib followed
by sunitinib had a median progression-free survival of
26.1 weeks, whereas 22 patients who received the reverse
sequence had a median progression-free survival of 22

weeks. There were also patients who responded to secondline agents in both groups. The authors concluded that sequential use of sorafenib and sunitinib was supported by
their data. We realize, however, that both retrospective
analyses only help with hypothesis construction and that
firm conclusions about the superiority of 1 sequence over
the other cannot be drawn.
Resistance to single-agent antiangiogenic therapy
may develop by way of compensatory mechanisms that
are driven by upregulation of plasma VEGF, fibroblast
growth factors, ephrin-A1, or angiopoietin-2, or
through the development of hypoxia-inducible factor
alpha (HIF1a)-independence through activation of
angiogenesis by interleukin-8, cycloxygenase-2, prostaglandin E2, NF-kB, RAS, PI3K/Akt or p38.11 Options
for overcoming acquired resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy may include the novel strategy of decreasing the
transcription of HIF by blocking the mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR).12 This strategy is now being
tested in clinical trials, which are comparing the efficacy
of temsirolimus to salvage therapy with sorafenib
(NCT00474786; temsirolimus vs sorafenib in patients
with advanced renal cell carcinoma who failed first-line
sunitinib). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase
3 study of everolimus versus placebo, an mTOR inhibitor was shown to have a progression-free survival and an
overall survival advantage when used in patients who
had progressed on prior sorafenib, sunitinib, or both.13
Until this novel therapy is proven safe and effective in
this setting, however, clinicians face the decision of
which available antiangiogenic agents to use in firstline, second-line, or third-line settings. To improve progression-free survival and overall survival, it is crucial to
identify the appropriate sequence of treatment. In an era
of multiple therapeutic options for patients with metastatic kidney cancer, prospective clinical trials must
address the crucial question of optimal sequencing of
antiangiogenic agents.
