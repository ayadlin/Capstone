Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Inference of transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiologic or pathologic
cellular states remains a central challenge in systems biology. A mesenchymal phenotype is the
hallmark of tumor aggressiveness in human malignant glioma but the regulatory programs
responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here, we
show that reverse-engineering and unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network
reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant
glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPβ and Stat3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master
regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPβ and Stat3
reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage whereas elimination of the
two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumor
aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPβ and Stat3 correlates with mesenchymal
differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results reveal that activation of a small
regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state
in cancer cells.

High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most common brain tumors in humans and are
essentially incurable1. The defining hallmarks of aggressiveness of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) are local invasion and neo-angiogenesis2, 3. A recently established notion postulates
that neoplastic transformation in the central nervous system (CNS) converts neural cells into
cell types manifesting a mesenchymal phenotype, a state associated with uncontrolled ability
to invade and stimulate angiogenesis4, 5. Gene expression studies have established that overexpression of a “mesenchymal” gene expression signature (MGES) and loss of a proneural
signature (PNGES) co-segregate with the poor prognosis group of glioma patients4. Yet,
differentiation along the mesenchymal lineage is virtually undetectable in normal neural
tissue during development. Thus, it is unclear whether drift toward the mesenchymal lineage
is an aberrant event that occurs during brain tumor progression or whether glioma cells
recapitulate the rare mesenchymal plasticity of neural stem cells (NSCs)4–7. The molecular
events that activate the MGES while suppressing the PNGES signature, thus imparting a
highly aggressive phenotype to glioma cells, remain unknown.

Efforts to identify TFs that are Master Regulators (MRs) of specific cancer signatures, based
on cellular-network models, have yet to produce experimentally validated discoveries, likely
because these networks are still poorly mapped, especially within specific mammalian
cellular contexts8. Notwithstanding, recent developments in genome-wide reverse
engineering were successful in identifying causal, rather than associative interactions9–12,
and showed promise in the identification of dysregulated genes within developmental and
tumor-related pathways13–17. Thus, we reasoned that context-specific regulatory networks,
inferred by unbiased reverse engineering algorithms may provide sufficient accuracy to
allow estimating (a) the activity of TFs from that of their transcriptional targets or regulons
and (b) the identity of TFs that are MRs of specific eukaryotic signatures18, 19 from the
overlap between their regulons and the signatures. We applied the above paradigms to
unravel the MRs causally linked to activation of the MGES in malignant glioma
(Supplementary Fig. 1).

A transcriptional module is linked to the MGES of HGGs
We first asked whether copy number variation may account for the aberrant expression of
MGES genes in HGGs. Integrated analysis of gene expression profiles and array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) of 76 HGGs showed no correlation between
mean expression and DNA copy number of MGES genes in proneural, mesenchymal, and
proliferative tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

We thus used the ARACNe algorithm9 to assemble a genome-wide repertoire of HGGsspecific transcriptional interactions (the HGG-interactome) from 176 gene expression
profiles of grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) and grade IV (GBM) samples previously
classified into three molecular signature groups – proneural, proliferative, and mesenchymal
(Supplementary Table 1a–c)4, 20, 21. ARACNe is an information theoretic approach for the
inference of TF-target interactions from large sets of gene expression profiles9, 16, further
refined to infer directed (i.e. causal) interactions12, 22 (see Methods). ARACNe predicted
92,660 transcriptional interactions, 1,217 of which were between TFs and 102 of 149 MGES
genes4, represented across all the gene expression profile data.

Author Manuscript

Next, we applied a novel Master Regulator Analysis (MRA) algorithm to the HGGinteractome. The algorithm computes the statistical significance of the overlap between the
regulon of each TF (i.e., its ARACNe-inferred targets) and the MGES genes (p-values
computed by Fisher Exact Test, FET). From a list of 928 TFs (Supplementary Table 2),
MRA inferred 53 MGES-specific TFs, at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 5%
(Supplementary Table 3a). These were ranked based on the total number of MGES targets
they regulated. The top six TFs (Stat3, C/EBP, bHLH-B2, Runx1, FosL2, and ZNF238)
collectively controlled >74% of the MGES genes (Fig. 1a). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were
grouped as they form stoichiometric homo and heterodimers with identical DNA binding
specificity and redundant transcriptional activity23. We thus use the term C/EBP to indicate
the TF complex with the union of their targets as the corresponding regulon. Consistent with
their previously reported activity24, 25, Spearman correlation analysis revealed that five of
these TFs are likely activators (Stat3, C/EBP, bHLH-B2, Runx1, and FosL2) and one is
likely a repressor (ZNF238). Overlap between the regulons of these TFs was highly
significant (Supplementary Table 4). MRA analysis of the PNGES and Proliferative
(PROGES) signatures of HGGs detected virtually no overlap among candidate MRs of the
three signatures, with the notable exception of few TFs inversely associated with MGES and
PNGES activation (Supplementary Table 5).

Author Manuscript

Next, we used stepwise linear regression (SLR) to infer simple, quantitative regulation
models for each MGES gene. Specifically, the log-expression of each MGES gene was fitted
by the linear combination of the log-expression of a small number of genes (1 – 5) (see
Methods), selected among 53 ARACNe-inferred and 52 additional TFs, whose DNAbinding signatures were enriched in promoters of MGES genes. Six TFs were in both lists,
for a total of 99 TFs (Supplementary Table 3b). TFs were then ranked based on the fraction
of MGES genes they regulated. Surprisingly, the top six MRA-inferred TFs were also
among the eight controlling the largest number of MGES targets, based on SLR analysis
(Supplementary Table 6). Indeed, the three with the highest linear-regression coefficient

values were C/EBP (α = 0.40), bHLH-B2 (α = 0.41), and Stat3 (α = 0.40), further
establishing them as likely MGES-MR candidates. The next strongest TF, ZNF238, had a
negative coefficient (α = −0.34) confirming its role as a candidate MGES repressor.

Validation of the mesenchymal regulatory module

Author Manuscript

To determine whether these TFs bind the promoter region of their predicted MGES targets,
we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in a human glioma cell line. On
average, TF-specific antibodies but not control antibodies immunoprecipitated 80% of the
tested genomic regions (Fig. 1b–f). Lentivirus-mediated shRNA silencing of C/EBPβ, Stat3,
bHLH-B2, FosL2, and Runx1 in glioma cells, followed by gene expression profiling and
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that, following silencing of each TF,
differentially expressed genes were highly enriched in their ARACNe-inferred targets but
not in those of control TFs with equivalent regulon size (Supplementary Table 7a).
Furthermore, differentially expressed genes were also enriched in MGES genes
(Supplementary Table 7b).

Author Manuscript

Promoter occupancy analysis revealed a hierarchical and highly modular topology, with 8 of
10 possible intra-module interactions implemented (modularity p-value = 1.0×10−8 by FET,
Fig. 2c). Specifically, C/EBPβ and Stat3 occupy their own promoter (Fig. 2a, b); C/EBPβ
occupies the Stat3, FosL2, bHLH-B2, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ promoters (Fig. 2a); Stat3
occupies those of FosL2 and Runx1 (Fig. 2b); FosL2 occupies those of Runx1 and bHLHB2 (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and bHLH-B2 occupies only the promoter of Runx1
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). C/EBP and Stat3 are at the top of this hierarchical regulatory
module. They have autoregulatory loops and form feed-forward loops with a larger fraction
of MGES genes (43%) than any of the other TF-pairs. ShRNA-mediated co-silencing of C/
EBPβ and Stat3 in glioma cells produced >2-fold reduction of the mRNAs coding for the
second layer TFs in the FF loops (bHLH-B2, FosL2, and Runx1, Fig. 2d), supporting their
role as MRs. C/EBPβ and Stat3 bound the promoters of their MGES targets also in primary
human GBM (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).

Author Manuscript

To functionally validate the role of C/EBPβ and Stat3 as MRs of the MGES, we conducted
gain and loss-of-function experiments. We transduced v-myc immortalized mouse NSCs
known as C17.226–28 as well as primary murine NSCs derived from the mouse
telencephalon at embryonic day 13.5 with retroviruses expressing C/EBPβ and a
constitutively active form of Stat3 (Stat3C)29. ShRNA-mediated silencing targeted C/EBPβ
and Stat3 in the human glioma cell line SNB19 and in serum-free cultures of tumor cells
derived from primary GBM that propel the formation of GBM-like tumors after intracranial
transplantation in immunodeficient mice30 (GBM-derived brain tumor initiating cells,
GBM-BTICs, see Fig. 5c–g). We generated a global dataset of 89 individual samples,
including 55 knockdown experiments in human glioma cells and 34 ectopic expression
experiments in mouse NSCs. Of the 149 genes in the MGES, 118 could be mapped to
murine genes represented on the array (Supplementary Table 8). Quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) analysis showed that, following C/EBPβ or Stat3 shRNA silencing in GBMBTICs and SNB19, the corresponding mRNA levels were significantly reduced compared to
non-target control transduced cells (C/EBPβ fold ratio = 0.26, p ≤ 0.00108, Stat3 fold ratio =

0.205, p ≤ 0.00109 by U-test). Reciprocal changes followed ectopic expression of the two
TFs in C17.2 and NSCs (Supplementary Table 9). QRT-PCR values and microarray-based
measurements were highly correlated for Stat3 but not for C/EBPβ mRNA (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Thus, we used the qRT-PCR values for C/EBPβ and Stat3 as more accurate readouts for their mRNA expression. GSEA analysis confirmed that genes co-expressed with the
two TFs were enriched in their respective ARACNe-inferred regulon genes but not in those
of control TFs (Supplementary Table 10). Perturbation of C/EBPβ (Supplementary Fig. 5a,
c) or Stat3 (Supplementary Fig. 5b, d) specifically affected the MGES signature (p =
2.69×10−2 and p = 2.0×10−4, respectively by GSEA). Common targets of C/EBP and Stat3
were 8-fold more enriched in MGES genes than targets controlled individually by each TF
(Fig. 2e, p = 2.25×10−5). To test whether the two TFs may be involved in synergistic MGES
control, we computed a metagene (C/EBPβ×Stat3) with expression proportional to the
product of their mRNAs, such that the metagene should be highly correlated with the
expression profile of any target synergistically regulated by the two TFs, under a
multiplicative model (Fig. 2f). GSEA analysis confirmed that genes ranked by Spearman
correlation to the C/EBPβ×Stat3 metagene were significantly enriched in MGES genes (Fig.
2g), suggesting that at least a subset of the MGES is synergistically regulated by the C/
EBPβ×Stat3 pair.

Author Manuscript

We sought to establish whether (a) MRs inferred by our procedure would also be inferred
when using an independent glioma sample datasets and (b) MRs identified on the basis of
clinical outcome would overlap significantly with those inferred from MGES analysis. The
Atlas-TCGA dataset31 includes 77 and 21 samples associated with worst- and bestprognosis, respectively (92 samples with intermediate prognosis were not considered).
Differential expression analysis identified a TCGA Worst-Prognosis Signature (TWPS),
comprising 884 genes differentially expressed in the worst-prognosis vs. best-prognosis
samples (at p ≤ 0.05 by Student’s t-test, Supplementary Table 11). GSEA analysis
confirmed that MGES genes were markedly enriched in the TWPS signature (p ≤ 1.0×10−4,
Supplementary Fig. 6) indicating that the poor-prognosis group in the Atlas-TCGA dataset
displays marked mesenchymal features. Despite partial overlap between MGES and TWPS
genes (22.8%), 5 of the 6 MRs identified by MRA analysis from the original dataset were
also found among the 10 most significant TFs identified by MRA analysis of the AtlasTCGA dataset using the TWPS signature. C/EBP was the most significant TF, while Stat3
was in 7th position. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ had the first and second best linear-regression
coefficient by SLR analysis, respectively (Supplementary Table 12). These results indicate
significant robustness of the approach both to dataset and signature selection.

Concurrent expression of C/EBPβ and Stat3 reprograms NSCs toward the
mesenchymal lineage
We tested whether combined and/or individual expression of Stat3C and C/EBPβ in NSCs is
sufficient to trigger the mesenchymal phenotype that characterizes HGGs. Introduction of C/
EBPβ and Stat3C in C17.2 NSCs caused loss of neuronal differentiation and manifestation
of a fibroblast-like morphology (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). The morphological changes
were associated with gain of the expression of the mesenchymal marker proteins SMA and

fibronectin (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 7c, d) and induced expression of the mesenchymal
genes Chi3l1/YKL40, Acta2/SMA, CTGF and OSMR (Fig. 3b). The individual expression of
Stat3C or C/EBPβ was generally insufficient to induce either mesenchymal marker proteins
or expression of mesenchymal genes (Fig. 3a, b). Removal of mitogens to Stat3C/C/EBPβexpressing C17.2 cells resulted in further increase of the expression of mesenchymal genes
and complete acquisition of mesenchymal properties such as positive alcian blue staining, a
specific assay for chondrocyte differentiation (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). The
expression of Stat3C and C/EBPβ promoted migration in a wound assay and triggered
invasion through the extracellular matrix in a Matrigel invasion assay in the absence or
presence of PDGF (Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Fig. 7g). The combined but not individual
expression of Stat3C and C/EBPβ efficiently induced mesenchymal marker proteins and
mesenchymal gene expression also in primary NSCs (Fig. 3f–h). Conversely, Stat3C and C/
EBPβ abolished differentiation along the neuronal and glial lineages (Fig. 3i, Supplementary
Fig. 7h). The C/EBPβ/Stat3C–induced mesenchymal transformation of primary NSCs was
associated with withdrawal from cell cycle (data not shown). Thus, the combined
introduction of C/EBPβ and Stat3C in NSCs prevents neural differentiation and triggers
reprogramming toward an aberrant mesenchymal lineage.

C/EBPβ and Stat3 are essential for mesenchymal transformation and
glioma aggressiveness

Transduction of GBM-BTICs cultures derived from two GBM patients (BTSC-20 and
BTSC-3408) with specific shRNA-carrying lentiviruses silenced endogenous C/EBPβ and
Stat3, eliminated expression of mesenchymal genes and depleted the tumor cells of the
mesenchymal marker proteins fibronectin, collagen-5A1 and YKL40. Individual silencing of
C/EBPβ or Stat3 produced variable inhibitory effects with the silencing of C/EBPβ typically
carrying the most severe consequences (Fig. 4a–e, Supplementary Fig. 8a). Combined or
individual silencing of C/EBPβ and Stat3 in the human glioma cell line SNB19 produced
similar effects (Supplementary Fig. 8b–e). Silencing of the two TFs in SNB19 and GBMBTICs reduced by >70% their ability to invade through Matrigel (Fig. 4f–i). Next, we
determined the impact of C/EBPβ and Stat3 knockdown on brain tumorigenesis after
intracranial injection of SNB19 in immunocompromised mice. We observed efficient tumor
formation in all mice injected with shcontrol and shStat3 cells. However, only one of four
mice from the shC/EBPβ and one of five mice from the shC/EBPβ+shStat3 groups
developed tumors after 120 days from the injection (Fig. 5b). The histologic analysis
demonstrated high-grade tumors, which displayed peripheral invasion of the surrounding
brain as single cells and cell clusters in the shRNA control group as shown by anti-human
vimentin staining (Fig. 5a). Staining for the endothelial marker CD31 revealed marked
vascularization in the shRNA control group of tumors. Conversely, the single tumor in the
shC/EBPβ+shStat3 group grew well circumscribed and was less angiogenic. Tumors in the
shStat3 group and the single tumor in the shC/EBPβ group had an intermediate growth
pattern and limited angiogenesis. Staining for fibronectin, collagen-5A1 and YKL40 were
readily detected in the tumors from the control group but absent or barely detectable in the
single tumors from the shC/EBPβ and shC/EBPβ+shStat3 groups (Fig. 5a). Tumors derived
from shStat3 cells displayed an intermediate phenotype with reduced expression of

mesenchymal markers compared with tumors in the shcontrol group but higher than that
observed in the tumors in the shC/EBPβ and shC/EBPβ+shStat3 groups (shcontrol > shStat3
> shC/EBPβ> shC/EBPβ+shStat3). Intracranial transplantation of GBM-BTICs transduced
with shRNA control lentivirus produced extremely invasive tumor cell masses extending
through the corpus callosum to the contralateral brain. Combined knockdown of C/EBPβ
and Stat3 led to significant decrease of the tumor area and tumor cell density as evaluated by
human vimentin staining, markedly reduced the proliferation index (Fig. 5c–e), and
abolished expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and collagen-5A1 (Fig. 5f, g).

Author Manuscript

Finally, we conducted an immunohistochemical analysis for C/EBPβ and active, phosphoStat3 in human tumor specimens, and compared their expression with that of YKL40 (a
well-established mesenchymal protein expressed in primary human GBM)21, 32 and with
patient outcome in a collection of 62 GBMs (Supplementary Fig. 9). Expression of either C/
EBPβ or Stat3 was significantly associated with YKL40 expression (C/EBPβ, p = 4.9×10−5;
Stat3, p = 2.2×10−4), with higher association in double positive tumors (C/EBPβ+/Stat3+, p
= 2.7×10−6) vs. double negative ones (C/EBPβ-/Stat3-, Supplementary Table 13). Double
positive tumors were associated with worse clinical outcome than either single or double
negative tumors (log-rank test, p=0.0002, Fig. 5h). Positivity for either of the two TFs
remained predictive of negative outcome but with lower statistical strength than double
positivity (C/EBPβ, p=0.0022; Stat3, p=0.0017).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We have shown that inference of context-specific regulatory network identifies the
transcriptional module that controls expression of the mesenchymal signature associated
with poor-prognosis in HGGs. In this approach, the traditional paradigm of gene expression
profile based cancer research, yielding long lists of differentially expressed genes (i.e.,
cancer signatures), becomes only a starting point for a cellular-network analysis, where a
causal regulatory model identifies the TFs controlling the signatures and related phenotypes.

Author Manuscript

Recently, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to identify common expression
signatures predictive of the same cellular phenotype33. Our approach produced virtually
identical regulatory MR modules when applied to two completely distinct datasets and
signatures associated with poor-prognosis in HGGs, thus indicating that MRs of mammalian
phenotype signatures may be significantly more conserved than the complement of
differentially expressed genes. Other methods, including differential expression analysis,
DNA-binding-site enrichment analysis8 and relevance network analysis34 could not identify
C/EBPβ and Stat3 as MRs (see Supplementary Note 2). This suggests that enrichment
analysis of ARACNe-inferred TF regulons is specifically useful for the identification of
MRs of cellular phenotypes. Our results do not exclude that other graph-theoretical methods
such as Bayesian Networks might provide further fine-grain regulatory insight once the
number of candidate MRs is reduced to a handful by methods such as those proposed here.
Yet, once a relatively small number of TFs is identified, direct experimental validation is
feasible.

The experimental follow-up established that C/EBPβ and Stat3 are MRs sufficient in NSCs
and necessary in human glioma cells for mesenchymal transformation. Interestingly, C/
EBPβ and Stat3 are expressed in the developing nervous system35–38. However, while Stat3
induces astrocyte differentiation and inhibits neuronal differentiation of neural stem/
progenitor cells, C/EBPβ promotes neurogenesis and opposes gliogenesis39–41. How can the
combined activity of C/EBPβ and Stat3 reprogram NSCs toward an aberrant lineage
(mesenchymal) and oppose the genesis of the normal neural lineages (neuronal and glial)?
We propose that mesenchymal transformation results from concurrent activation of two
conflicting transcriptional regulators normally operating to funnel opposing signals
(neurogenesis vs. gliogenesis). This scenario is intolerable by normal neural stem/progenitor
cells whereas it operates to permanently drive the aberrant mesenchymal phenotype in the
context of the genetic and epigenetic changes that accompany high-grade gliomagenesis
(EGFR amplification, PTEN loss, Akt activation, etc.)4. Since expression of C/EBPβ and
Stat3 in human glioma is essential to maintain the tumor initiating capacity and the ability to
invade the normal brain, the two TFs provide important clues for diagnostic and
pharmacological intervention. Consistent with this, the combined expression of C/EBPβ and
Stat3 is linked to the mesenchymal state of primary GBM and provides an excellent
prognostic biomarker for tumor aggressiveness. Thus, systems biology methods can be
effectively used to infer MRs that choreograph malignant transformation. This paradigm
will be applicable to the dissection of other phenotypic states.

METHODS SUMMARY
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

Primary NSCs were isolated from E13.5 mouse telencephalon and cultured in the presence
of FGF-2 and EGF as described42. Differentiation was induced by culturing NSCs in NSC
medium without EGF and FGF-2. GBM-derived BTICs were grown in Neurobasal media
supplemented with FGF-2 and EGF.
Generation of transcriptional network, microarrays and qRT-PCR
GBM transcriptional network was generated by ARACNe12. Total RNA was reverse
transcribed to complementary DNA and amplified using primers specific for human and
murine transcripts. Expression values were calculated relative to the β-actin gene. RNA was
used for analysis on Illumina HumanHT-12v3 or MouseWG-6 expression BeadChip.
Sample information is in Methods.
Master Regulator Analysis

Author Manuscript

For each TF, the statistical significance of the intersection between the TF-regulon and the
gene expression signature was computed by Fisher Exact Test. Significant genes were
ranked based on the number of overlapping genes.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
The statistical significance of the enrichment of a ranked list of genes in a smaller set of
genes was determined as described43.

Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR)

Author Manuscript

The regulatory model of each gene was determined by identifying the smallest number of
TFs that were informative for the expression of that gene across the dataset. TFs were added
to the model one at the time, until the error reduction produced by adding another TF was no
longer statistically significant. Models had on average 1 to 5 TFs.
Intracranial injection of glioma cells
SNB19 glioma cell line and GBM-derived BTICs were injected into the brain of 6–8 weeks
NOD/SCID 48 h after infection with lentiviruses carrying shRNAs using a stereotaxic
frame. Animals were monitored and euthanized when they presented with signs of tumor.
Mouse research was approved by the Committee for Animal Care, and conducted in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations.

Methods
Array comparative genomic hybridization expression correlation
The correlation between gene expression and DNA copy number for the MGES genes was
determined using data from 76 high-grade gliomas for which both gene expression array and
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) profiling were performed4. Tumors were
grouped based on molecular subtype (mesenchymal, proneural, or proliferative) and the
mean expression for MGES genes were determined in each group. The normalized copy
number of each gene was interpolated based on the copy number of the nearest genomic
clone on the CGH array as determined by comparison of the sequence annotation of both
array platforms, as previously described21.

ARACNe network reconstruction

Author Manuscript

ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks), an
information-theoretic algorithm for inferring transcriptional interactions, was used to
identify a repertoire of candidate transcriptional regulators of the MGES genes. Expression
profiles used in the analysis were previously characterized using Affymetrix HU-133A
microarrays and preprocessed by MAS 5.0 normalization procedure4. First, candidate
interactions between a TF (x) and its potential target (y) are identified by computing
pairwise mutual information, MI[x; y], using a Gaussian kernel estimator12 and by
thresholding the mutual information based on the null-hypothesis of statistical independence
(p < 0.05 Bonferroni corrected for the number of tested pairs). Then, indirect interactions are
removed using the data processing inequality, a well-known property of the mutual
information. For each TF-target pair (x, y) we considered a path through any other TF (z)
and remove any interaction such that MI[x; y] < min( MI[x; z], MI[y; z]).
Transcription Factor classification
To identify human transcription factors (TFs), we selected the human genes annotated as
“transcription factor activity” in Gene Ontology and the list of TFs from TRANSFAC. From
this list, we removed general TFs (e.g. stable complexes like polymerases or TATA-box-

binding proteins), and added some TFs not annotated by GO, producing a final list of 928
TFs that were represented on the HU-133A microarray gene set.
Master Regulator Analysis
The MRA has two steps. First, for each TF its signature-enrichment is computed as the pvalue of the overlap between the TF-regulon and the signature genes (i.e. the MGES genes
in this case), assessed by Fisher Exact Test (FET). Since FET depends on regulon size, it can
be used to assess signature-enriched TFs but not to rank them. TFs are thus ranked based on
the total number of signature genes included in their regulon, under the assumption that TFs
controlling a larger fraction of the signature will be more likely to determine its activity.
Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) Analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A regulatory program for each MGES gene was computed as follows: the log2 expression of
the i-th MGES gene was considered as the response variable and the log2-expression of the
TFs as the explanatory variables in the linear model log xi = ∑ αij log fj + βij 44. Here, fj
represents the expression of the j-th TF in the model and the (αij, βij) are linear coupling
coefficients computed by standard regression analysis. TFs are iteratively added to the
model, by choosing each time the one producing the smallest relative error E = ∑ |xi − xi0|/xi0
between predicted and observed target expression. This is repeated until the decrease in
relative error is no longer statistically significant, based on permutation testing. To avoid
excessive multiple hypothesis testing correction, TFs were chosen only among the
following: (a) the 53 inferred by ARACNe at FDR < 0.05 and (b) TFs whose DNA binding
signature was significantly enriched in the proximal promoter of the MGES genes and that
are expressed in the dataset, based on the coefficient of variation (CV ≥ 0.5). TFs were then
ranked based on the number of MGES target they regulated, with the average LinearRegression coefficient providing additional insight. The log-transformation allows
convenient linear representation of multiplicative interactions between TF activities44, 45.
TFs were individually added to the model, each time selecting the one contributing the most
significant reduction in relative expression error (predicted vs. observed), until errorreduction was no longer significant.
Enrichment analysis
The false discovery rates (FDR) are computed using procedures described by Benjamini and
Hochberg46, where the adjusted p-values, q=p*n/i (p=p-value, n=total number of tests,
i=sorted rank of p-value). It is a less conservative procedure to correct for multiple
comparisons than familywise error rate (FWER), especially when the number of tests is
large.

Cell lines and cell culture conditions
SNB75, SNB19, 293T and Phoenix cell lines were grown in DMEM plus 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS, Gibco/BRL). GBM-derived BTICs were grown as neurospheres in Neurobasal
media (Invitrogen) containing N2 and B27 supplements (Invitrogen), and human
recombinant FGF-2 and EGF (50 ng/ml each; Peprotech,). Murine neural stem cells
(mNSCs) (from an early passage of clone C17.2) (27–29) were cultured in DMEM plus 10%

heat inactivated FBS, (Gibco/BRL), 5% Horse serum (Gibco/BRL) and 1% L-Glutamine
(Gibco/BRL). Neuronal differentiation of mNSCs was induced by growing cells in DMEM
supplemented with 0.5% Horse serum. For chondrocyte differentiation, cells were treated
with STEMPRO chondrogenesis differentiation kit (Gibco/BRL) for 20 days. Primary
mNSCs were isolated from E13.5 mouse telencephalon and cultured in the presence of
FGF-2 and EGF (20 ng/ml each) as described42. Differentiation of NSCs was induced by
culturing neurospheres on laminin-coated dishes in NSC medium in the absence of growth
factors. mNSC expressing Stat3C and C/EBPβ, were generated by retroviral infections using
supernatant from Phoenix ecotropic packaging cells transfected with pBabe-Stat3C-FLAG
and/or pLZRS-T7-His-C/EBPβ-2–IRES-GFP.
Promoter analysis and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

Promoter analysis was performed using the MatInspector software (www.genomatix.de). A
sequence of 2kb upstream and 2kb downstream from the transcription start site was analyzed
for the presence of putative binding sites for each TFs. Primers used to amplify sequences
surroundings the predicted binding sites were designed using the Primer3 software (http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) and are listed in Supplementary Table
14.

ChIP was performed as described in Ref.47. SNB75 cell lysates were precleared with Protein
A/G beads (Santa Cruz) and incubated at 4°C overnight with 1 µg of polyclonal antibody
specific for C/EBPβ (sc-150, Santa Cruz), Stat3 (sc-482, Santa Cruz), FosL2 (Fra2, sc-604,
Santa Cruz), bHLH-B2 (A300–649A, BETHYL Laboratories), or normal rabbit
immunoglobulins (Santa Cruz). DNA was eluted in 200 µl of water and 1 µl was analyzed
by PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). For primary GBM samples, 30 mg of frozen tissue
was transferred in a tube with 1 ml of culture medium, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15
min and stopped with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for
2 min, washed twice and diluted in PBS. Tissues were homogenized using a pestle and
suspended in 3 ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer with protease inhibitors and
sonicated. ChIP was then performed as described above.
QRT-PCR and microarray analysis
RNA was prepared with RiboPure kit (Ambion), and used for first strand cDNA synthesis
using random primers and SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). QRT-PCR was
performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers are
listed in Supplementary Table 15. QRT-PCR results were analyzed by the ΔΔCT method48
using 18S as housekeeping gene.

RNA amplification for Array analysis was performed with Illumina TotalPrep RNA
Amplification Kit (Ambion). 1.5 µg of amplified RNA was hybridized on Illumina
HumanHT-12v3 (including 24,385 human genes) or MouseWG-6 (including 20,311 mouse
genes) expression BeadChip according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridization
data was obtained with an iScan BeadArray scanner (Illumina) and pre-processed by
variance stabilization and robust spline normalization implemented in the lumi package

Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described50. Primary antibodies
and dilutions were: SMA (mouse monoclonal, Sigma, 1:200), Fibronectin (mouse
monoclonal, BD Biosciences, 1:200), Tau (rabbit polyclonal, Dako, 1:400), βIIITubulin
(mouse monoclonal, Promega, 1:1000), CTGF (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz, 1:200),
YKL40 (rabbit polyclonal, Quidel, 1:200) and Col5A1 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz,
1:200). Confocal images acquired with a Zeiss Axioscop2 FS MOT microscope were used
to score positive cells. At least 500 cells were scored for each sample. Quantification of the
fibronectin intensity staining in mNSC was performed using NIH Image J software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, NIH, USA). The histogram of the intensity of fluorescence of each point
of a representative field for each condition was generated. The fluorescence intensity of
three fields from three independent experiments was scored, standardized to the number of
cells in the field and divided by the intensity of the vector. For immunostaining of xenograft
tumors, mice were perfused trans-cardially with 4% PFA, brains were dissected and postfixed for 48h in 4% PFA. Immunostaining was performed as previously described51.
Primary antibodies and dilutions: fibronectin (mouse moclonal, BD Bioscences, 1;100),
Col5A1 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz, 1:100), YKL40 (rabbit polyclonal, Quidel, 1;100),
human vimentin (mouse monoclonal, Sigma, 1:50), Ki67 (rabbit polyclonal, Novocastra
laboratories, 1:1000). Quantification of the tumor area was obtained by measuring the
human vimentin positive area in the section using the NIH Image J software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/, NIH, USA). Five tumors for each group were analyzed. For
quantification of Ki67, the percentage of positive cells was scored in 5 tumors per each
group. In histogram values represents the mean values; error bars are standard deviations.
Statistical significance was determined by t test (with Welch's Correction) using GraphPad
Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). Immunohistochemistry of primary
human GBM was performed as previously described52. The primary antibodies and dilutions
were: anti-YKL40 (rabbit polyclonal, Quidel, 1:750), anti C/EBPβ, (rabbit polyclonal, Santa
Cruz, 1:250) and anti-p-Stat3 (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling, 1;25), Scoring for YKL40
was based on a 3-tiered system, where 0 was <5% of tumor cells positive, 1 was 5–30%
positivity and 2 was >30% of tumor cells positive. Scores of 1 and 2 were later collapsed
into a single value for display purposes on Kaplan-Meier curves. Associations between C/
EBPβ/Stat3 and YKL40 were assessed using the Fisher exact test (FET). Associations
between C/EBPβ/Stat3 and patients survival were assessed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
test of equality of survival distributions.

Migration and invasion assays
For the wound assay testing migration, mNSCs were plated in 60 mm dishes and grown
until 95% confluence. A scratch of approximately 1000 µm was made with a P1000 pipet tip
and images were taken every 24 h with an inverted microscope. For the Matrigel invasion
assay, mNSCs and SNB19 (1×104) were added to the upper compartment of a 24 well
BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Bioscences) in serum free DMEM. The lower
compartment of the chamber was filled with DMEM containing either 0.5% horse serum or

20 µg/ml PDGF-BB (R&D systems) as chemoattractant. After 24 h, invading cells were
fixed, stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions and counted. For GBM-derived
BTICs, 5×104 cells were plated on the upper chamber in the absence of growth factors. In
the lower compartment Neurobasal medium containing B27 and N2 supplements plus 20
µg/ml PDGF-BB (R&D systems) was used as chemoattractant.
Lentivirus infection
Lentiviral expression vectors carrying shRNAs were purchased from Sigma. The sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table 16. To generate lentiviral particles, each shRNA
expression plasmid was co-transfected with pCMV-dR8.91 and pCMV-MD2.G vectors into
human embryonic kidney 293T cells using Fugene 6 (Roche). Lentiviral infections were
performed as described51.

Intracranial Injection
Intracranial injection of SNB19 glioma cell line and GBM-derived BTICs was performed in
6–8 weeks NOD/SCID mice (Charles River laboratories) in accordance with guidelines of
the International Agency for Reserch on Cancer’s Animal Care and Use Committee. Briefly,
48 h after lentiviral infection, 2×105 SNB19 or 3×105 BTICs were injected 2 mm lateral and
0.5 mm anterior to the bregma, 3 mm below the skull. Mice were monitored daily and
sacrificed when neurological symptoms appeared. Kaplan–Meier survival curve of the mice
injected with SNB19 glioma cells was generated using the DNA Statview software package
(AbacusConcepts, Berkeley CA).
