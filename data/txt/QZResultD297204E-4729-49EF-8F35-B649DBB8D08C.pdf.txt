Abstract
The most abundant and biologically active green tea catechin,
( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate or ( )-EGCG, has been shown to
act as a proteasome inhibitor and tumor cell death inducer.
However, ( )-EGCG is unstable under physiologic conditions
and has poor bioavailability. Previously, in an attempt to
increase the stability of ( )-EGCG, we introduced peracetate
protections to its reactive hydroxyl groups and showed that
this peracetate-protected ( )-EGCG [Pro-EGCG (1); formerly
named compound 1] could be converted into ( )-EGCG under
cell-free conditions. In the current study, we provide evidence
that when cultured human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells
were treated with Pro-EGCG (1), ( )-EGCG was not only
converted but also accumulated, accompanied by enhanced
levels of proteasome inhibition, growth suppression, and
apoptosis induction, compared with cells treated with natural
( )-EGCG. To investigate the potential use of Pro-EGCG (1)
as a novel prodrug that converts to a cellular proteasome
inhibitor and anticancer agent in vivo, MDA-MB-231 tumors
were induced in nude mice, followed by treatment with ProEGCG (1) or ( )-EGCG for 31 days. Results of this in vivo study
showed a significant inhibition of breast tumor growth by
Pro-EGCG (1), compared with ( )-EGCG, associated with
increased proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in
tumor tissues. In conclusion, we have shown that Pro-EGCG
(1) increases the bioavailability, stability, and proteasomeinhibitory and anticancer activities of ( )-EGCG in human
breast cancer cells and tumors, suggesting its potential use for
cancer prevention and treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4303–10]

Introduction
Second only to water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage
in the world. Epidemiologic studies indicate that green tea
consumption is associated with cancer-preventative effects (1–3).
Biologically active components of green tea include polyphenolic
catechins, ( )-epicatechin [( )-EC], ( )-epicatechin-3-gallate [( )ECG], ( )-epigallocatechin [( )-EGC], and ( )-epigallocatechin-3gallate [( )-EGCG; ref. 4]. Several studies indicate that ( )-EGCG
is the most abundant and biologically active catechin with respect
to anticancer activity in several human cancers (5–7). Various
potential mechanisms contributing to the anticancer effects of

( )-EGCG have been described, including suppression of Wnt
signaling (8), blockade of methylation (9), and inhibition of matrix
metalloproteinase (10) and the proteasome (11–16).
The eukaryotic proteasome is a large multi-catalytic, multisubunit protease complex possessing at least three distinct
activities, which are associated with three different h subunits:
chymotrypsin-like (with h5 subunit), trypsin-like (with h2 subunit),
and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing–like (PGPH- or caspaselike, with h1 subunit; ref. 17). Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like
but not the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome has been found
to be associated with induction of tumor cell apoptosis (18, 19). By
examining a broad range of cell culture models, it has been found
that proteasome inhibitors rapidly induce tumor cell apoptosis,
selectively activate the cell death program in cancer or oncogenetransformed but not normal or untransformed cells, and are able to
trigger apoptotic death in human cancer cells that are resistant to
various anticancer agents (20–24).
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341; Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research
and Development, L.L.C.) is the first of its class to receive regular
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of cancer. However, some toxicity from bortezomib
treatment was observed (20, 21), suggesting a need to discover new
proteasome inhibitors with no or less toxicity. By reducing or
eliminating noxious substances in the treatment of cancer, the
recovery period could be lessened and the efficacy of the treatment
potentially promoted.
Our previous studies have indicated that the ester bond–
containing green tea polyphenol ( )-EGCG (Fig. 1A) potently
inhibits the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity in vitro and in
cultured tumor cells (15, 16). Proteasome inhibition by natural and
synthetic ( )-EGCG analogues leads to accumulation of proteasome target proteins (such as InBa, Bax, and p27) and subsequent
induction of apoptosis in human cancer cell lines, as measured by
activation of caspases and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; refs. 11–13, 15, 16, 25). However, ( )-EGCG is relatively
unstable under neutral or alkaline conditions and could be rapidly
degraded, involving deprotonation of hydroxyl groups on the
phenol rings (26–29). Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups of ( )EGCG could be modified through biotransformation reactions,
including methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfate formation,
resulting in reduced biological activities in vivo (26–29).
Previously, in an attempt to enhance the stability of ( )-EGCG,
we introduced peracetate-protecting groups to the reactive
hydroxyls of ( )-EGCG [Pro-EGCG (1); Fig. 1A] and found that it
was converted to the parent ( )-EGCG under cell-free conditions
(11). In the current study, we provide additional evidence that in
intact human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, Pro-EGCG (1) is

also converted to its parent compound, ( )-EGCG, and the
converted ( )-EGCG is then accumulated. Consistently, increased
levels of proteasome inhibition, growth suppression, and apoptosis
induction were observed in these breast cancer cells treated with
Pro-EGCG (1), compared with ( )-EGCG. Furthermore, treatment
of breast cancer–bearing nude mice with Pro-EGCG (1) resulted in
tumor growth inhibition and massive apoptosis induction, which
are associated with proteasome inhibition in vivo. The data suggest
that under physiologic conditions, Pro-EGCG (1) acts as a prodrug
of ( )-EGCG, which imparts, after its conversion, more efficient
proteasome inhibition than natural ( )-EGCG, and is indicative of
a great potential for cancer prevention and treatment.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Bisbenzimide Hoechst no. 33258 stain, 3-[4,5-dimethyltiazol2-yl]-2.5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), DMSO, cremophor, and
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. RPMI 1640, penicillin,
and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. The fluorogenic peptide
substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC ( for the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like) was from
Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal antibody against human PARP was
purchased from BIOMOL International LP. Mouse monoclonal antibodies
against Bax (B-9), p27 (F-8), and ubiquitin (P4D1); goat polyclonal
antibodies against actin (C-11) and InB-a (C15); and secondary antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Synthesis of Pro-EGCG (1). Synthesis of Pro-EGCG (1) from ( )-EGCG
was done as described (11, 30).
Cell culture and cell extract preparation. MDA-MB-231 cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37jC in a
humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. A whole-cell extract
was prepared as previously described (31).
High-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Using a solid
phase (Xterra) with unique selectivity properties for polyphenols, gradient
elution conditions were identified that separated highly polar compounds
[( )-EGCG] from nonpolar substances [Pro-EGCG (1)] within 25 min.
Specificity studies using MDA-MB-231 cell extracts that were added to
various concentrations of the various analytes proved that the cell extract
did not contain any endogenous substances that would interfere with peak
identification as low as 50 ng/mL. The cells were extracted in a cold
aqueous formic acid to simultaneously solubilize the cells and stabilize the
polyphenol analytes. A general purpose high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed using a Waters Xterra PR18 5-Am
(3.9  150 mm) reverse-phase column with gradient elution and
acetonitrile/methanol under acidic conditions to stabilize the analytes
against degradation and to readily extract them from cell pellets. Reference
standards used to confirm peak identity and to quantify each analyte in the
particular biomatrix of interest were prepared in methanol. Cells were
washed with medium and used to prepare cell extracts by adding 1 mL
of 0.05% formic acid containing the internal standard to each tube to
10 Ag/mL and vortexing to create a slurry. The cell slurry (250 AL) was
transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 500 AL methanol, vortexed,

sonicated for 15 s, and microfuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the
macromolecules. Finally, 100 AL were transferred and inserted in the HPLC
autosampler and 20 AL were injected for analysis.
Cell proliferation assay. The MTT assay was used to determine the
effects of various compounds on proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate and grown to either 70% to
80% ( for the 24-h time point) or 30% to 40% ( for the 72-h time point)
confluency, followed by addition of 50 Amol/L of each compound and 24 or
72 h of incubation at 37jC, as indicated. Inhibition of cell proliferation was
measured as previously described (32).
Proteasome activity assay. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were
grown to 30% to 40% confluency, treated daily with 50 Amol/L of the
indicated compound for 3 days, harvested, and used for whole-cell extract
preparation. Whole-cell extracts (10 Ag) were incubated with Suc-Leu-LeuVal-Tyr-AMC (40 Amol/L) fluorogenic substrate at 37jC in 100 AL of assay
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 2.5 h. After incubation, production of
hydrolyzed 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) groups was measured using
a Victor3 Multilabel Counter with an excitation filter of 380 nm and an
emission filter of 460 nm (Perkin-Elmer).
Cellular and nuclear morphology analysis. A Zeiss Axiovert 25
microscope was used for all microscopic imaging with either phase contrast
for cellular morphology or fluorescence for nuclear morphology with
Hoechst staining, as previously described (32).
Caspase-3 activity assay. Cells were treated with 50 Amol/L of each
compound, harvested, and lysed as previously described (16). Ac-DEVDAMC (40 Amol/L) was then incubated with the prepared cell lysates for
2.5 h and the caspase-3 activity was measured as previously described (18).
Western blot analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated, harvested,
and lysed. Cell lysates (50 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by visualization using the
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) as previously
described (33).
Human breast tumor xenograft experiments. Female athymic nude
mice, ages 5 weeks, were purchased from Taconic Research Animal Services
and housed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of Wayne State University.
Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (5  106) suspended in 0.1 mL of
serum-free RPMI 1640 were inoculated s.c. in both flanks of each mouse
( four mice per group). When tumors reached a size of f150 mm3, the mice
were randomly grouped and treated by daily s.c. injection with 50 mg/kg of
( )-EGCG, Pro-EGCG (1), or vehicle [20% DMSO and 80% cremophor/
ethanol (3:1)]. Tumor size was measured every other day using calipers and
their volumes were calculated according to a standard formula: width2 
length / 2. Mice were sacrificed after 31 days of treatment when control
tumors reached f1,500 mm3. The tumors were collected and photographed, and the tumor tissues were used for different assays for measuring
proteasome inhibition and cell death.
Terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling,
immunostaining, and H&E assays using tumor tissues. Terminal
nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using
in situ apoptosis detection kit and immunostaining of p27 were done as
previously described (34). H&E staining in tumor tissues was done following
the manufacturer’s protocols. The proteasomal activity assays, caspase-3/
caspase-7 activity assays, and Western blot analyses using animal tumor
samples were done as described above using cultured breast cancer cells.
Statistical analysis. To evaluate the difference between treated and
control animal groups with respect to tumor growth, the Student t test was
applied. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.

ronment, Pro-EGCG (1) could also be converted to ( )-EGCG,
highly metastatic and invasive human breast cancer MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 50 Amol/L of either Pro-EGCG (1) or ( )EGCG every 24 h for 72 h, followed by extraction of intracellular
polyphenols for HPLC analysis.
The HPLC results indicated that in Pro-EGCG (1)–treated MDAMB-231 cells, 1,810 pmol Pro-EGCG (1)/mg protein were recovered
(Table 1). Additionally, 530 pmol ( )-EGCG/mg protein were
recovered in the same cells (Table 1), showing that Pro-EGCG (1)
was absorbed and converted to ( )-EGCG in these cells. In
comparison, in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ( )-EGCG, only 222
pmol of ( )-EGCG/mg protein was recovered, 2.4-fold less than
that recovered from the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated cells (Table 1).
Therefore, Pro-EGCG (1) seems to be better absorbed into the cells,
converted into ( )-EGCG, and accumulated in greater quantity
than natural ( )-EGCG does under the same conditions. This
finding provides further evidence for our previous hypothesis that
Pro-EGCG (1) behaves as a prodrug form of ( )-EGCG (11). It
should be noted that similar levels of ( )-EGCG (50–150 pmol/mg
protein) were also recovered from other cultured cell lines after
( )-EGCG treatment (26–29) and that Pro-EGCG (1) has superior
bioavalability over ( )-EGCG (35).
Pro-EGCG (1) inhibits proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We then investigated the effects of Pro-EGCG (1) and
( )-EGCG on proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. A 24-h treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells with Pro-EGCG (1) or ( )-EGCG at 50 Amol/L
revealed only 25% and 10% inhibition, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Therefore, we lengthened the treatment period by treating these
cells with 50 Amol/L of each compound every 24 h for 72 h,
followed by an MTT assay. At the end of the experiment, Pro-EGCG
(1) inhibited cell proliferation by f55% whereas ( )-EGCG
inhibited only by 16% (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that ProEGCG (1) is f3.5-fold more potent than ( )-EGCG in inhibiting
breast cancer cell proliferation.
Inhibition of the proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity by
Pro-EGCG (1) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that Pro-EGCG (1) could target the tumor cellular proteasome
in MDA-MB-231 cells. To explore whether Pro-EGCG (1) has greater
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like inhibitory activity than ( )-EGCG,
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 50 Amol/L of each compound
for 24 h. After each treatment, proteins were extracted and used
for measuring proteasome inhibition by the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity assay. The 24-h treatment revealed that the
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited by 48%
and 8% in the Pro-EGCG (1)– and ( )-EGCG–treated cells,

Results
HPLC analysis indicates conversion of Pro-EGCG (1) to ( )EGCG in human breast cancer cells. Previously, we showed that
under cell-free conditions, Pro-EGCG (1), the peracetate-protected
form of ( )-EGCG, could be converted into the parent, unprotected
( )-EGCG (11). To determine whether, within the cellular envi-

respectively (Fig. 1C). When the treatment period was lengthened
to every 24 h for 72 h, we found that Pro-EGCG (1) significantly
inhibited the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by 66%
whereas ( )-EGCG was considerably less effective, inducing only
f24% inhibition (Fig. 1C). Therefore, Pro-EGCG (1) treatment
exhibited f3-fold greater inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity
compared with ( )-EGCG treatment.
Inhibition of proteasomal activity should cause accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins and natural proteasome targets (such as
InB-a; refs. 18, 25, 36). Accumulation of InB-a protein prevents
the activation of antiapoptotic nuclear factor nB (37), resulting
in apoptosis. A significant amount of ubiquitinated proteins
were indeed detected in cells treated with Pro-EGCG (1) after
72-h treatment (Fig. 1D). We have reported a ubiquitinated form of
InB-a protein with molecular weight of f56 kDa (33). A similar
p56 band appeared after Pro-EGCG (1) treatment, detectable by the
specific antibody to InB-a (Fig. 1D, arrow). Levels of p27 and Bax,
two well-known target proteins of the proteasome (25, 36), were
also increased in cells treated with Pro-EGCG (1) (2.2- and 2.0-fold,
respectively, compared with the control; Fig. 1D). Comparatively,
( )-EGCG treatment under the same conditions induced limited
proteasome inhibition and accumulation of proteasome target
proteins (Fig. 1C and D).
Induction of apoptosis by Pro-EGCG (1) in MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells. It has been shown that inhibition of the
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like but not trypsin-like activity is
associated with apoptosis induction in cancer cells (18, 19). To
investigate whether the proteasomal inhibition by Pro-EGCG (1)
treatment is associated with apoptosis induction, both morphologic changes and apoptosis-specific PARP cleavage were
investigated in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Pro-EGCG (1) or
( )-EGCG after 72 h. Changes in cell morphology were observed
after 72 h in both Pro-EGCG (1)– and ( )-EGCG–treated cells
(Fig. 2A). However, the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated cells exhibited
the most extreme morphologic changes with cell membranes
that appeared irregular and jagged compared with the control
(Fig. 2A). Morphologies after 24-h treatment were not significantly
changed (data not shown). Consistent with apoptosis induction,
the appearance of punctate, brightly stained apoptotic nuclei was
observed in the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated cells whereas very few
appeared in the ( )-EGCG–treated cells after Hoechst staining
(Fig. 2B). Furthermore, treatment with Pro-EGCG (1) induced
activation of caspase-3/caspase-7 after 24 and 72 h of treatment
(2- and 3-fold, respectively; Fig. 2C). Compared with ( )-EGCG
treatment, Pro-EGCG (1) was 2.1-fold more potent in the
activation of caspase-3/caspase-7 (Fig. 2C) and more effectively
induced cleavage of the intact PARP protein after 72 h of
treatment (Fig. 1D). Although the ( )-EGCG–treated cells also
displayed apoptotic events in these assays, the Pro-EGCG (1)–
treated cells exhibited considerably stronger indices of apoptotic
cell death. These results show that Pro-EGCG (1) treatment
imparts more potent inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like
activity and induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells than ( )-EGCG treatment.
Pro-EGCG (1) inhibits the growth of human breast cancer
xenografts, associated with proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in vivo. Because Pro-EGCG (1) treatment
showed the improved proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities in cultured breast cancer cells compared with ( )EGCG (Figs. 1 and 2), we then investigated whether Pro-EGCG (1)
could do so in vivo and exert improved antitumor activity in a

mouse model. MDA-MB-231 cells (5  106) were implanted s.c. in
5-week-old female athymic nude mice. On reaching a palpable size
(f150 mm3), the mice were treated s.c. daily with either the
vehicle control or 50.0 mg/kg of Pro-EGCG (1) or ( )-EGCG (as a
comparison). Significant inhibition of tumor growth by Pro-EGCG
(1) was observed as early as 5 days after treatment and persisted
after 31 days of treatment, showing that Pro-EGCG (1) has
antitumor activity (Fig. 3A). By comparison, EGCG had very little
effect on tumor growth for the first 21 days relative to control and
showed much weaker inhibition of tumor growth relative to ProEGCG (1) (Fig. 3A). At the end of 31 days, control tumors grew to
an average size of 1,582 F 29 mm3 whereas ( )-EGCG–treated
tumors grew to 1,223 F 21 mm3, and Pro-EGCG (1)–treated tumors
grew to only 723 F 50 mm3 (Fig. 3A). This corresponds to 54%
growth inhibition in the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated tumors (P < 0.01;
Fig. 3A) and 23% growth inhibition in the ( )-EGCG–treated
tumors (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, these findings indicate that
Pro-EGCG (1) was 2.3-fold more effective at growth inhibition
in vivo than ( )-EGCG in this breast tumor model. A similar study
conducted using the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 indicated that
Pro-EGCG (1) was an equally effective growth inhibitor (54%
growth inhibition) whereas ( )-EGCG again exhibited limited
effectiveness (24% growth inhibition; data not shown).

( )-EGCG Prodrug as a Proteasome Inhibitor In vivo

The MDA-MB-231 tumors were then collected and used for
proteasome activity and apoptosis assays. The proteasomal
chymotrypsin-like activity was inhibited by 40% in the tumors
treated with Pro-EGCG (1) compared with control [3.2-fold
greater inhibition than ( )-EGCG treatment; Fig. 3B]. Consistently, Western blot analysis showed that levels of ubiquitinated
proteins and InB-a, p27, and Bax proteins were accumulated in
tumors treated with Pro-EGCG (1) compared with the vehicle
control (Fig. 3C). On average, Pro-EGCG (1)–treated tumors
displayed accumulated InB-a by 2.0-fold, p27 by 1.5-fold, and
Bax by 3.3-fold (Fig. 3C). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the
increased expression of p27 in the tumors treated with ProEGCG (1) (Fig. 4A). In comparison, ( )-EGCG treatment had
much less proteasome-inhibitory effect (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore,
Pro-EGCG (1) treatment inhibited tumor proteasome activity
in vivo with increased potency compared with ( )-EGCG
treatment.
To determine whether apoptosis is responsible for the observed
antitumor activity of Pro-EGCG (1), several assays were done using
tumor tissue samples. Caspase-3 activity was increased in the ProEGCG (1)–treated animal tumors, compared with the control
animals, and was 1.7-fold higher than that of ( )-EGCG–treated
tumors (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, apoptotic cells, as indicated by
TUNEL positivity, and apoptotic nuclei, as shown by nuclear
condensation using H&E staining, were observed in tumors from
animals treated with Pro-EGCG (1) but not with ( )-EGCG (Fig. 4B
and C). Finally, a cell death–associated PARP cleavage fragment
was detected to the greatest extent in extracts of tumors treated
with Pro-EGCG (1) (Fig. 3C). Again, when samples from ( )EGCG–treated tumors were analyzed in these assays, much less
apoptosis was detected (Figs. 3 and 4). During the 31-day period of

Pro-EGCG (1) and ( )-EGCG treatment, no overall gross toxicity
was observed and animals showed no weight loss, decreased
activity, or anorexia.

Discussion
The pervasiveness of drug resistance extends to virtually every
known disseminated cancer and, therefore, pursuing molecular
targets for cancer therapeutics has become increasingly important. Numerous studies indicate that cancer and transformed cells
are significantly more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than
normal, nontransformed cells (12, 13, 20–22, 38), providing
relevance for proteasome inhibitors as potential novel anticancer
drugs. Our previous studies have suggested that polyphenolic
compounds from natural plant sources are innocuous toward
normal cells whereas they could inhibit the proteasome in cancer
cells (15, 16).
We have shown that ( )-EGCG is a natural inhibitor of
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity (15, 16). However, ( )EGCG is unstable under physiologic conditions and could be
rapidly degraded or metabolized through interactions with the
hydroxyl groups on the phenol rings (26–29). Because of these
factors, ( )-EGCG is known to have poor bioavailability, an issue
which has often been overlooked in translating in vitro activities
into in vivo animal and human studies (39).
To improve the bioavailability of ( )-EGCG, we have previously
synthesized Pro-EGCG (1), a protected, seemingly prodrug form of
( )-EGCG, using peracetylation (11). Pro-EGCG (1) most likely
requires the presence of esterases within the cellular milieu for its
conversion to ( )-EGCG and has been shown to have no effect
against a purified 20S proteasome (11). In the current study, we

Pro-EGCG (1) is associated with inhibition

activity and induction of apoptosis in vivo.

show that Pro-EGCG (1) can indeed be converted to the parent
( )-EGCG in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Table 1).
Moreover, the amount of recovered ( )-EGCG from the Pro-EGCG
(1)–treated cells was f2.4-fold greater than the amount of ( )EGCG recovered from the ( )-EGCG–treated cells at 72 h (Table 1).
Furthermore, a considerable amount of Pro-EGCG (1) remained
inside the cells at 72 h (Table 1), indicating the potential for
additional conversion to ( )-EGCG.
Although both enhancing ( )-EGCG entry into cells and
preventing its degradation are important for maintaining effective
cellular ( )-EGCG concentration, we reasoned that preventing
( )-EGCG degradation is technically more difficult than improving ( )-EGCG entry into cells. Our data have clearly indicated
that the peracetate-protected form of ( )-EGCG has improved
ability to enter tumor cells. Furthermore, the conversion of ( )EGCG from Pro-EGCG (1) seems to be stable and accumulation in
the breast cancer cells was observed. We have similarly found
that in human leukemia Jurkat T cells, Pro-EGCG (1) can also be
converted to ( )-EGCG, which was subsequently accumulated.4 A
recent report in which peracetylation increased the bioavailability
of ( )-EGCG in esophageal and colon cancer cells (35)
substantiates our findings.

Treatment with ( )-EGCG has been shown to induce apoptosis
in MDA-MB-231 cells (40) and to accumulate cell cycle regulatory
proteins such as p21 and p27 (41). To test our hypothesis that ProEGCG (1) increases the bioavailability of ( )-EGCG and subsequent
proteasome inhibition over ( )-EGCG alone, MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells were treated daily for 72 h and examined for their
proteasomal activity. After 72 h, Pro-EGCG (1) treatment induced
inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in MDA-MB231 cells, with at least 2-fold greater potency than ( )-EGCG
treatment (Fig. 1C). The observed proteasome inhibition from
Pro-EGCG (1) treatment correlated with the accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins, ubiquitinated InB-a, and other proteasome
target proteins, p27 and Bax (Fig. 1D), and induced a 50% reduction
in cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the 2- to 3-fold more ( )EGCG recovered from the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated cells (Table 1) also
correlates well with the 2- to 3-fold increase in inhibition of
proteasomal activity and proliferation (Fig. 1).
To be sure that this apparent proteasome inhibition by ProEGCG (1) treatment would lead to induction of apoptosis, we
examined morphologic changes (indicative of apoptotic cell
death), the presence of apoptotic nuclei, the event of activated
caspase-3/caspase-7, and, ultimately, production of the cleaved
PARP fragment (Fig. 2). As MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to
Pro-EGCG (1), changes in cell morphology were evident, along
with condensed nuclei representative of apoptosis (Fig. 2A and
B). Confirming these findings, Pro-EGCG (1)–treated cells

displayed caspase-3/caspase-7 activation and cleaved PARP most
noticeably after 72-h treatment (Fig. 2C and D). Again, ( )EGCG was a less potent inducer of apoptosis under the same
conditions (Fig. 2).
Because these in vitro findings were so promising, we chose to
examine the effects of Pro-EGCG (1) versus ( )-EGCG treatment in
a mouse model. Treatment with Pro-EGCG (1) resulted in
significant inhibition of proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity,
accumulation of several proteasome target proteins (i.e., p27), and
induction of apoptosis in tumors (Figs. 3 and 4). Associated with
the observed proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction,
significant tumor growth inhibition (f54%) by Pro-EGCG (1)
was observed in this breast tumor model (Fig. 3A) and in a prostate
tumor system (data not shown). Again, ( )-EGCG treatment
caused much less proteasome inhibition, apoptosis induction, and
tumor growth suppression (Figs. 3 and 4).
It is important to note that the molecular weight of Pro-EGCG
(1) is 1.7-fold greater than ( )-EGCG and, therefore, the amount
used for these in vivo studies was proportionally lower. Given that
54% growth inhibition was observed in the Pro-EGCG (1)–treated
tumor samples, we presume that potentially as much as an
additional 1.7-fold greater growth inhibition may have been
detected had the tumor samples been treated with an equal
number of drug molecules.
The concentrations of ( )-EGCG and Pro-EGCG (1) used to treat
cultured breast cancer cells are higher than those found in the
blood of tea drinkers. However, the dose for either Pro-EGCG (1) or

( )-EGCG treatment in our mouse model seemed to be well
tolerated. During the 31-day treatment, there was no overall gross
toxicity observed. However, more detailed microscopic and
macroscopic pathologic studies are required to definitively
document the lack of toxicity when Pro-EGCG (1) is used at these
concentrations.
The findings reported here indicate that Pro-EGCG (1) seems to
be a promising, novel anticancer prodrug in vitro and in vivo, and
its mechanism of action involves targeting the tumor cellular
proteasome and inhibiting the growth of human tumor cells. Using
an innocuous natural product or its prodrug as a chemosensitizer
may reduce the toxicity and boost the effectiveness of current
chemotherapeutics. Future analysis of Pro-EGCG (1) in a
combinational regimen may elucidate increased effectiveness of
this novel agent in additional cancer models.
