Abstract
Doxorubicin is among the most effective and widely used
anticancer drugs in the clinic. However, cardiotoxicity is one
of the life-threatening side effects of doxorubicin-based
therapy. Dexrazoxane (Zinecard, also known as ICRF-187)
has been used in the clinic as a cardioprotectant against
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The molecular basis for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane, however, is not fully understood. In the present study,
we showed that dexrazoxane specifically abolished the DNA
damage signal ;-H2AX induced by doxorubicin, but not
camptothecin or hydrogen peroxide, in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.
Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage was also specifically
abolished by the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and
MG132 and much reduced in top2B / mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) compared with TOP2B+/+ MEFs, suggesting
the involvement of proteasome and DNA topoisomerase IIB
(Top2B). Furthermore, in addition to antagonizing Top2
cleavage complex formation, dexrazoxane also induced rapid
degradation of Top2B, which paralleled the reduction of
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. Together, our results
suggest that dexrazoxane antagonizes doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage through its interference with Top2B, which could
implicate Top2B in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The specific
involvement of proteasome and Top2B in doxorubicininduced DNA damage is consistent with a model in which
proteasomal processing of doxorubicin-induced Top2B-DNA
covalent complexes exposes the Top2B-concealed DNA doublestrand breaks. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8839–46]

Introduction
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin), a topoisomerase II (Top2)-targeting
drug, is one of the most effective anticancer drugs used in the
clinic. However, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy could result in,
among other toxic side effects, life-threatening cardiotoxicity.
Patients receiving a cumulative doxorubicin dose of z500 mg/m2
have significantly increased risk of developing cardiac toxicity,
including cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (1–4).
Despite the severity of this dose-limiting toxicity, the molecular
mechanism underlying doxorubicin cardiotoxicity remains unclear.

Currently, the free radical hypothesis is most favored due to the
redox cycling ability of doxorubicin (an anthraquinone; refs. 1–4) to
generate highly reactive oxygen free radicals.
The cardioprotectant dexrazoxane (Zinecard, also known as
ICRF-187) is currently in clinical use to protect against doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity (5). The mechanism for the protection has been
primarily attributed to iron chelation by the EDTA-like hydrolysis
product of dexrazoxane (4), which could decrease the level of
hydroxyl free radicals through its chelation of iron (6, 7). However,
cardioprotection through iron chelation is still controversial, as the
iron chelator ICL670A (deferasirox) shows no protection against
doxorubicin despite its efficient iron chelating capability and rapid
intracellular distribution (8). Several other free radical scavengers
also fail to rescue doxorubicin cardiotoxicity (1).
Dexrazoxane belongs to a class of molecules, bis(2,6-dioxopiperazines), which are known to function as Top2 catalytic inhibitors
(9). These compounds are known to antagonize the formation of
Top2-DNA covalent (cleavage) complexes through its stabilization
of the ATP-bound closed-clamp conformation of Top2 that is
unable to access chromosomal DNA (10). In addition, a bis(2,6dioxopiperazines) derivative, ICRF-193, has been shown to induce
degradation of Top2h through a proteasome-dependent pathway
(11). It is currently unclear whether the cardioprotective effect of
dexrazoxane may involve Top2.
It is well established that the antitumor activity of doxorubicin is
due to the formation of a Top2-doxorubicin-DNA ternary complex
(the cleavable or cleavage complex; refs. 12–14). There are two Top2
isozymes, Top2a and Top2h, in mammalian cells (15). Doxorubicin,
as well as other Top2-directed anticancer drugs such as etoposide
(VP-16), amsacrine, and mitoxantrone, targets both isozymes
(16, 17). However, the two Top2 isozymes are regulated very
differently (18–21). Top2a, which is only expressed in proliferating
and tumor cells, plays important roles in cell cycle events, such as
DNA replication, chromosome condensation/decondensation, and
sister chromatid segregation (15). The high efficacy of doxorubicin
chemotherapy is thought to be due to the highly elevated
expression of Top2a in cancer cells. By contrast, Top2h is present
in all cells, including postmitotic cells (18, 20, 22, 23). Recent
studies have suggested that Top2h may play a role in transcription
(24, 25). Furthermore, VP-16 has been shown to induce preferential
degradation of the Top2h isozyme through a proteasome pathway,
which presumably is responsible for the exposure of Top2hconcealed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 26). Indeed, recent
studies have suggested that the Top2h isozyme is predominantly
responsible for the carcinogenic side effect associated with VP-16
chemotherapy (27). However, the role of Top2h in doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity is not known. It is noteworthy, however, that Top2h,
but not Top2a, is expressed in adult heart (18).

In the present study, we show that dexrazoxane antagonizes
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through its interference with
Top2h, which could implicate Top2h in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. TOP2h+/+ and top2h / primary mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated from E13.5 mouse embryos following
standard protocols (28). MEFs and H9C2 cardiomyocytes were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FetalPlex animal serum complex (Gemini
Bio-Products), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), penicillin (100 units/mL), and
streptomycin (100 Ag/mL) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37jC. To assay
doxorubicin cytotoxicity in MEFs, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was done. MEFs (1.1  104) were seeded
in 96-well plates for 48 h. Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (solvent
control) or 200 Amol/L dexrazoxane for 5 h followed by coincubation with
doxorubicin for 1 day or VP-16 for 2 days. MTT (0.1 mg) was then added to
each well and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37jC. After
removal of medium, DMSO was added and absorbance at 570 nm
was measured using the Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). Average IC50 values
(mean F SE) were determined in triplicate or quadruplicate.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in 3 SDS sample buffer [175 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 15% glycerol, 5% SDS, 300 mmol/L DTT, 0.006%
bromphenol blue] followed by boiling for 10 min. Cell lysates were then
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was done using anti–g-H2AX
(JBW301, Upstate) and anti–a-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank) antibodies followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Pierce). Chemiluminescence signals were then captured using
X-ray films or the Kodak Image Station 2000R ( for quantification).
Neutral comet assay. Primary MEFs were treated with DMSO or
doxorubicin for 1.5 h in a CO2 incubator at 37jC followed by additional
30-min incubation in fresh medium to reverse Top2 cleavage complexes.
H9C2 cells were treated with DMSO or dexrazoxane (100 Amol/L) for 3 h,
washed, and replenished with fresh medium. Cells were then treated with
DMSO or doxorubicin for 1.5 h followed by additional 30-min incubation in
fresh medium to reverse Top2 cleavage complexes. Cells were then washed
and trypsinized using 0.005% trypsin and resuspended in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FetalPlex animal serum complex (10,000/mL). Cell
suspension (50 AL) was then mixed with 500 AL 0.5% low-melting point
agarose at 37jC. Cell/agarose mixture (75 AL) was transferred onto glass
slides. Slides were then immersed in prechilled lysis buffer [2.5 mol/L NaCl,
100 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 10.0), 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO]
for 1 h followed by equilibration in 1 Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer for 30
min. Slides were electrophoresed in 1 TBE at 1.0 V/cm for 10 min and
stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences). Images were visualized
under a fluorescence microscope and captured with a charge-coupled
device camera. The average comet tail moment was determined from
measuring at least 100 cells for each treatment group as described
previously (26). Statistical analysis of the mean comet tail moments was
done using Student’s t test.
Band depletion assay. H9C2 cells (1.2  105) were treated with
250 Amol/L VP-16 in the presence or absence of dexrazoxane (150 Amol/L)
for 15 min. Cells were either lysed immediately or incubated in drug-free
medium for another 30 min at 37jC (to reverse Top2 cleavage complexes)
before lysis. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the antiTop2a/Top2h (obtained from Dr. Jaulang Hwang, Institute of Molecular
Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) and anti–a-tubulin antibody. The
amount of Top2 cleavage complexes can be estimated from the difference
between the amount of free Top2 after reversal and the amount of free Top2
without reversal.
Homology modeling of the NH2-terminal ATPase domain of human
Top2A and Top2B in complex with dexrazoxane. The Modeller (8v2)
program was used for construction of the homology models based on the
crystal structure of the yeast Top2 ATPase domain in complex with
dexrazoxane (ICRF-187; refs. 29–31). The template structure (1QZR.PDB)
used to build the model has missing residues and side chains (10). The

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

missing side chains and residues in this structure were replaced and refined
using the profix program from the Jackal suite of programs (32–34). The
positions of dexrazoxane, ADPNP, and magnesium ions were taken from the
yeast crystal structure template (10). The variables for dexrazoxane and the
cofactor, ADPNP, were derived from the Amber 9 Antechamber program
(35). Partial atomic charges were computed using the AM1-BCC method
(36). Each structure model was coarsely refined using the Amber ff03 (37)
and general Amber force field with the following energy minimization
protocol: 500 steps steepest descents followed by 1,500 steps of conjugate
gradient (38, 39).

Results
Dexrazoxane abolishes doxorubicin-induced DNA damage
in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin is known to have two
major activities, poisoning of Top2 and induction of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) through redox cycling, both of which are
known to cause DNA damage. In the current study, we tested
whether dexrazoxane could prevent doxorubicin-induced DNA
damage in H9C2 cardiomyocytes and determined the molecular
mechanism for this effect. As shown in Fig. 1A, doxorubicin
induced the DNA damage signal g-H2AX (Ser139-phosphorylated
H2AX, a key DNA damage signal induced by DNA DSBs) in H9C2
cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX was concentration
dependent up to 1 Amol/L. At higher concentrations of doxorubicin

A, 1.5  105 H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and
10 Amol/L of doxorubicin (Doxo ) in the presence (+dexrazoxane ) or absence
( dexrazoxane) of dexrazoxane (200 Amol/L) for 1 h. Cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blotting using anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin antibody
(for assessing protein loading). B, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with
0.1% DMSO (C ; for solvent control), 0.1 or 1 Amol/L doxorubicin, 5 Amol/L VP-16
(VP ), 10 Amol/L camptothecin (CPT), or 100 Amol/L H2O2 in the presence
or absence of dexrazoxane (200 Amol/L) for 1 h. Cells were then lysed and
analyzed by Western blotting using anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin antibody.
C, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.1% DMSO (for solvent control),
0.5 Amol/L doxorubicin, or 10 Amol/L VP-16 in the presence (+ICRF-193 ) or
absence ( ICRF-193) of ICRF-193 (50 Amol/L) for 1 h. Cells were then lysed
and analyzed by Western blotting using anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin antibody.

Figure 2. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is proteasome dependent. A, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.1% DMSO (for solvent control), 0.5 Amol/L
doxorubicin, or 10 Amol/L VP-16 for 1 h in the presence or absence of 100 Ag/mL vitamin C (top ) or 100 Ag/mL N -acetylcysteine (NAC ; bottom ). Vitamin C and
N-acetylcysteine were added 30 min before doxorubicin. Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin antibody. B, H9C2
cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.1% DMSO (solvent control), 0.5 Amol/L doxorubicin, or 10 Amol/L VP-16 for 1 h in the presence or absence of either 1 Amol/L
bortezomib or 4 Amol/L MG132. Bortezomib and MG132 were added 30 min before doxorubicin or VP-16. Cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting (top )
using anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin antibody. Bottom, quantification of g-H2AX signals. C, H9C2 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO, 1 Amol/L bortezomib, or
4 Amol/L MG132 for 30 min followed by cotreatment with either 0.1% DMSO (control ) or 0.5 Amol/L doxorubicin for 1.5 h. Neutral comet assay was then done as
described in Materials and Methods. The average comet tail moments were plotted as histograms. Columns, mean; bars, SE. *, P < 0.001, t test.

(5 and 10 Amol/L), the g-H2AX signal was dramatically reduced.
This pattern of concentration-dependent inhibition is reminiscent
of dose-dependent inhibition of doxorubicin-induced Top2 cleavable/cleavage complexes (12). In the presence of dexrazoxane
(200 Amol/L), the doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX signal was
completely blocked. This blocking effect seemed to be specific
to Top2-directed drugs, such as doxorubicin and VP-16 (Fig. 1B).
g-H2AX induced by camptothecin (a topoisomerase I poison) and
H2O2 in H9C2 cardiomyocytes could not be blocked by cotreatment
with dexrazoxane (Fig. 1B).
To test whether the blocking effect of dexrazoxane was due to
inhibition of Top2, another well-characterized Top2 catalytic
inhibitor, ICRF-193, was also tested. As shown in Fig. 1C, both
the doxorubicin-induced (0.5 Amol/L) and the VP-16–induced
(10 Amol/L) DNA damage signal, g-H2AX, was indeed abolished
by cotreatment with ICRF-193 (Fig. 1C).
Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is blocked by proteasome
inhibitors. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage could be due to
either Top2-DNA covalent (cleavable/cleavage) complexes or ROS.
As shown in Fig. 2A, doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX was unaffected
by the known ROS scavengers, vitamin C (100 Ag/mL) and
N-acetylcysteine (100 Ag/mL). By contrast, as shown in Fig. 2B,
the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (1 Amol/L) and MG132
(4 Amol/L) significantly reduced (>50% reduction, see Fig. 2B,
bottom for quantification) the g-H2AX signal induced by doxorubicin and VP-16. Recent studies have suggested that proteasomal
processing of VP-16–induced Top2-DNA covalent complexes results
in the exposure of Top2-concealed DSBs (26). Thus, the involvement of proteasome in doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX could implicate
the involvement of Top2 in doxorubicin-induced DNA damage.
To test whether DSBs were indeed induced by doxorubicin and
prevented by proteasome inhibitors, a neutral comet assay was
done. As shown in Fig. 2C, doxorubicin-induced comet tail
moment, which reflects the amount of chromosomal DNA DSBs,
was significantly reduced by cotreatment with either bortezomib
(P < 0.001, t test) or MG132 (P < 0.001, t test). These results further

suggest that, similar to VP-16–induced DSBs, doxorubicin-induced
DSBs are also Top2 mediated and proteasome dependent.
Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is Top2B mediated. The
Top2h, but not the Top2a, isozyme is expressed in adult heart
(18). To test whether Top2h is involved in doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage, doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX was measured in
primary MEFs isolated from TOP2h+/+ (wild-type) and top2h /
(top2h knockout) embryos. As shown in Fig. 3A, doxorubicininduced g-H2AX was greatly reduced in top2h / MEFs compared
with TOP2h+/+ MEFs. Similarly, g-H2AX induced by VP-16 was also
greatly reduced in top2h / MEFs (Fig. 3B). By contrast, g-H2AX
was induced by H2O2 and camptothecin to a similar extent in
top2h / and TOP2h+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that
the doxorubicin-induced DNA damage signal g-H2AX is primarily
Top2h mediated in MEFs.
We have also investigated the role of Top2h in doxorubicininduced chromosomal DNA DSBs using the neutral comet assay.
Primary TOP2h+/+ and top2h / MEFs were treated with doxorubicin for 1.5 h followed by incubation in drug-free medium for
30 min to reverse doxorubicin-trapped Top2 cleavage complexes.
Neutral comet assay was then done to analyze the formation of
DSBs. As shown in Fig. 3C, doxorubicin (0.5 and 1 Amol/L)
treatment led to a 2-fold increase in comet tail moment compared
with control treatment (0.1% DMSO) in TOP2h+/+ MEFs (P < 0.001,
t test; white columns), whereas no significant increase (P > 0.2,
t test) in comet tail moment was observed in doxorubicin-treated
top2h / MEFs (black columns). These results suggest that
doxorubicin-induced DSBs are primarily Top2h mediated in MEFs.
In addition to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, we also
investigated the role of Top2h and the effect of dexrazoxane on
doxorubicin cytotoxicity using MTT assay in confluent (to reduce
the contribution from Top2a) primary MEFs. top2h / MEFs were
shown to be more resistant to doxorubicin than TOP2h+/+ MEFs.
The IC50 of doxorubicin in top2h / MEFs (2.85 F 0.10 Amol/L)
was significantly higher compared with that in TOP2h+/+ MEFs
(0.95 F 0.06 Amol/L; P < 0.05, t test), suggesting a major role of

drug-induced protein-DNA cross-links as well as DNA single-strand
breaks as monitored by alkaline elution assay (40). Indeed, as
shown in Fig. 4A, VP-16 trapped both Top2a (f70% depleted in
free Top2a) and Top2h (f70% depleted in free Top2h) into Top2DNA covalent complexes to a similar extent (compare lanes 2 and
3) as evidenced by a band depletion assay. On the other hand, the

in primary MEFs. A, 2  105 primary top2 h / and TOP2h+/+ MEFs were
treated with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 Amol/L of doxorubicin for 1 h. Cells were lysed
and analyzed by Western blotting using either anti–g-H2AX or anti–a-tubulin
antibody. B, primary top2 h / and TOP2 h+/+ MEFs were either untreated (for
control) or treated with H2O2 (30 or 150 Amol/L), camptothecin (1 or 10 Amol/L), or
VP-16 (100 Amol/L) for 1 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as
described in (A). C, primary top2 h / and TOP2 h+/+ MEFs were treated with
0 (control ; 0.1% DMSO was added as solvent control), 0.5, or 1 Amol/L of
doxorubicin for 1.5 h and neutral comet assay was then done as described in
Materials and Methods. Average comet tail moments were plotted as histograms.

Top2h in doxorubicin cytotoxicity in primary MEFs. Consistent
with this interpretation, top2h / MEFs were also shown to be
significantly more resistant to VP-16 (another Top2 poison; IC50 =
47.3 F 4.3 Amol/L) compared with TOP2h+/+ MEFs (IC50 = 28.3 F
1.0 Amol/L; P < 0.05, t test). As a control, the growth-inhibitory
activity of H2O2 was also determined and shown to be the same in
top2h / MEFs and TOP2h+/+ MEFs (IC50 = 0.2 mmol/L). In
addition, dexrazoxane (200 Amol/L) also significantly increased
(2- to 3-fold) the IC50 of doxorubicin (2.18 F 0.16 Amol/L) and
VP-16 (95.8 F 1.9 Amol/L) in TOP2h+/+ MEFs (P < 0.05, t test). By
contrast, dexrazoxane had no effect on the growth-inhibitory activity
of H2O2 in TOP2h+/+ MEFs (IC50 = 0.2 mmol/L). These results suggest
that doxorubicin cytotoxicity is Top2h dependent and dexrazoxane
can protect doxorubicin cytotoxicity in primary MEFs.
Dexrazoxane induces proteasomal degradation of Top2B in
cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that Top2h plays an
important role in doxorubicin cytotoxicity and doxorubicininduced DNA damage in primary MEFs. However, it is unclear
how dexrazoxane antagonizes doxorubicin cytotoxicity and doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. One possibility is that dexrazoxane
antagonizes the formation of doxorubicin-induced Top2 cleavage
complexes because dexrazoxane has been shown to reduce Top2

in the presence or absence of dexrazoxane (150 Amol/L) for 15 min. The amount
of Top2 cleavage complexes was measured by a band depletion assay as
described in Materials and Methods. Cells were lysed either immediately or
after reversal of the Top2 cleavage complexes (R +250 ). Cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Top2a/Top2h or anti–a-tubulin antibody.
B, 1.2  105 H9C2 cells were treated with 100 Amol/L dexrazoxane for indicated
times (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h). Cells were then lysed and protein levels of Top2a
and Top2h isozymes were determined by Western blotting. C, H9C2 cells were
treated with 0.1% DMSO (for solvent control), dexrazoxane (100 Amol/L), or
ICRF-193 (50 Amol/L) for 2 or 4 h in the presence or absence of the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib (1 Amol/L). Cell lysates were immunoblotted using
anti-Top2h antibody. D, H9C2 cells were treated with ICRF187 (100 Amol/L) for

dexrazoxane (yellow ).

amount of VP-16–trapped Top2a (f10% depleted) and Top2h
(f10% depleted) covalent complexes (compare lanes 5 and 6) was
much reduced in the presence of dexrazoxane. These results
suggest that dexrazoxane can effectively antagonize the formation
of VP-16–induced Top2a-DNA and Top2h-DNA covalent (cleavage)
complexes in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.
However, recent studies have also shown that a related
compound, ICRF-193, can efficiently induce proteasome-mediated
degradation of Top2h (11). Degradation of Top2h is also expected
to reduce doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and doxorubicin
cytotoxicity in H9C2 cells. We therefore tested the effect of
dexrazoxane on the protein level of Top2h in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment of H9C2 cells with 100 Amol/L
dexrazoxane induced a time-dependent disappearance of the
Top2h isozyme, whereas no significant effect on the level of the
Top2a isozyme was observed. Similar to ICRF-193–induced
degradation of Top2h, dexrazoxane-induced degradation of Top2h
is proteasome mediated. As shown in Fig. 4C, cotreatment of H9C2
cardiomyocytes with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib abolished dexrazoxane-induced degradation of Top2h. These results
suggest that dexrazoxane induces efficient proteasomal degradation of Top2h in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.
To test whether dexrazoxane-induced Top2h degradation could
contribute to the protective effect of dexrazoxane on doxorubicininduced DNA damage, H9C2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with

dexrazoxane for 4 h to induce Top2h degradation and doxorubicininduced chromosomal DNA DSBs were then measured by the
neutral comet assay in the absence of dexrazoxane. As shown in
Fig. 4D, dexrazoxane pretreatment effectively reduced doxorubicininduced comet tail moment (P < 0.001, t test). Together, these
results suggest that dexrazoxane could protect doxorubicininduced DNA damage at least in part through proteasomal
degradation of Top2h.
Dexrazoxane targets mammalian Top2A and Top2B isozymes. Our current studies have shown that dexrazoxane can
antagonize the formation of both Top2a and Top2h cleavage
complexes, suggesting the binding of dexrazoxane to both Top2
isozymes. On the other hand, our current studies have also shown
that dexrazoxane induces specific degradation of the Top2h, but
not the Top2a, isozyme, which could suggest specific binding of
dexrazoxane to Top2h isozyme. To clarify this issue, we did
homology modeling studies of hTop2a and hTop2h in complex
with dexrazoxane based on the structure of the cocrystal of
dexrazoxane and the ATPase domain of yeast Top2 (see Materials
and Methods; ref. 10).
As shown in Fig. 5, dexrazoxane was shown to form a tight
complex with the ATPase domain of human Top2h at the dimer
interface. The overall structure of the human Top2h-dexrazoxane
complex is very similar to that of the yeast Top2-dexrazoxane
complex (10). In addition, dexrazoxane forms various interactions

the complex is very similar to that of the human Top2hdexrazoxane complex. Most strikingly, the various interactions
between dexrazoxane and the amino acid side chains at the
binding sites of the two human isozymes are identical (Fig. 5,
middle and bottom ). These modeling studies suggest that
dexrazoxane can form a tight complex with both human Top2
isozymes.

Discussion

Figure 6. Two proposed mechanisms for the antagonistic effect of dexrazoxane
on doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. In this model, only the role of the
Top2h isozyme is considered, which would mimic the situation in adult heart
where Top2h, but not Top2a, is expressed. Top2h is shown to exist in two
states, free Top2h (mechanism I) and DNA-bound Top2h (mechanism II), at
equilibrium. Dexrazoxane can bind to Top2h in either state. For mechanism I,
binding of dexrazoxane to free Top2h stabilizes the closed-clamp conformation
of ATP-bound Top2h and thus prevents binding of Top2h (closed clamp)
to chromosomal DNA. Consequently, doxorubicin is unable to trap Top2h into
cleavage complexes. For mechanism II, dexrazoxane binds to DNA-bound
Top2h and stabilizes the closed-clamp conformation of ATP-bound Top2h,
which triggers proteasomal degradation of Top2h (Top2h down-regulation).
Top2h down-regulation results in depletion of Top2h and thus fewer doxorubicintrapped Top2h cleavage complexes. The formation of doxorubicin-trapped
Top2h cleavage complexes leads to DNA DSBs through proteasome-mediated
processing, which, if not repaired, could contribute to cell death and possible
tissue toxicity (e.g., cardiotoxicity).

with the same conserved amino acid side chains (see amino acids
at the binding sites in Fig. 5, middle) at the binding site of human
Top2h ATPase domain as those of the yeast Top2 ATPase domain.
We have also done homology modeling of the human Top2a
(ATPase domain)-dexrazoxane complex. The overall structure of

Doxorubicin is one of the most effective and widely used
anticancer agents in the clinic. Being an anthraquinone and a
strong DNA intercalator, doxorubicin has complex biological
activities (41–43). The anticancer activity of doxorubicin has been
attributed to its targeting of DNA Top2 by stabilizing a Top2doxorubicin-DNA covalent complex, referred to as cleavable or
cleavage complex (12). This anticancer activity is believed to be
related to the ability of doxorubicin to intercalate DNA and hence
poisoning of Top2. However, the life-threatening cardiotoxicity
associated with the use of doxorubicin is believed to result from
the redox cycling activity of doxorubicin due to its quinone moiety
(1–4). Both the redox cycling activity, which generates ROS, and
the Top2-targeting activity, which generates Top2-DNA covalent
complexes, are expected to induce DNA damage. In the current
study, we have determined the contribution of these two activities
to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage.
We show that doxorubicin induces g-H2AX, a key DNA damage
signal reflecting primarily DNA DSBs, in H9C2 cardiomyocytes.
Using this system, we have shown that the doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage signal is unlikely to be the result of ROS-mediated
DNA damage because vitamin C and N-acetylcysteine cannot
attenuate this signal. Instead, several pieces of evidence suggest
that the doxorubicin-induced DNA damage signal is primarily due
to the formation of Top2-DNA covalent complexes. First,
doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX was shown to be specifically
abolished by proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib. This
result is suggestive of an involvement of Top2 because Top2-DNA
covalent (cleavage) complexes, unlike other DNA damages (e.g.,
H2O2-mediated DNA damage), are known to require proteasome
for their processing into DNA damage (DSBs; ref. 26). Indeed,
doxorubicin is shown to induce chromosomal DNA DSBs in a
proteasome-dependent manner (Fig. 2C and see the lower half of
the diagram in Fig. 6 for the model). Second, doxorubicin-induced
g-H2AX is much attenuated in top2h / MEFs compared with that
in TOP2h+/+ MEFs, suggesting the involvement of Top2h. Together,
these results suggest the involvement of both Top2-DNA covalent
complexes and proteasome in doxorubicin-induced DNA damage,
which is consistent with the model that proteasome-mediated
degradation of Top2-DNA covalent complexes exposes Top2concealed DSBs (26).
We have also shown that dexrazoxane specifically abolished
doxorubicin-induced and VP-16–induced, but not camptothecinand H2O2-induced, g-H2AX in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Because both
doxorubicin and VP-16, but not camptothecin and H2O2, are Top2
poisons, this result supports the conclusion that dexrazoxane
antagonizes doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through its specific
interference with Top2. Additional support for this conclusion
comes from the use of ICRF-193 (structurally related to dexrazoxane, ICRF-187), which is a well-characterized Top2 catalytic activity
inhibitor (9). ICRF-193, which is more potent than dexrazoxane in
inhibiting Top2, is shown to be highly effective in antagonizing

doxorubicin-induced g-H2AX in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The fact
that both dexrazoxane and ICRF-193 antagonize the doxorubicininduced DNA damage signal suggests not only the involvement of
Top2 but also a potential mechanism for their antagonism. Bis(2,6dioxopiperazines), such as ICRF-193 and ICRF-159, are known
to stabilize the closed-clamp conformation of ATP-bound Top2
(44, 45). It has been well documented that the closed-clamp
conformation of Top2 interferes with the formation of Top2
cleavage complexes induced by Top2-directed drugs possibly due to
the inability of the closed-clamp form of Top2 to access
chromosomal DNA (46, 47). Consequently, dexrazoxane may
antagonize doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through preventing
the formation of Top2 cleavage complexes on chromosomal DNA
[due to dexrazoxane stabilization of the closed-clamp conformation of Top2 (10), which is unable to access chromosomal DNA].
The identification of Top2h as the major target of doxorubicin to
induce DNA damage has suggested a possible new mechanism for
the antagonistic effect of dexrazoxane on doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage. ICRF-193 is known to induce preferential degradation of the Top2h isozyme through a proteasome pathway, referred
to as Top2h down-regulation (11). The reduced Top2h level in
ICRF-193–treated cells is expected to decrease the amount of
doxorubicin-induced Top2h cleavage complexes and hence reduce
DNA damage. Indeed, we have shown that dexrazoxane, like ICRF193, is highly effective in reducing the level of Top2h (but not
Top2a) in H9C2 cardiomyocytes through the activation of a
proteasome pathway (Fig. 4). Consequently, dexrazoxane is likely to
antagonize doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through two mechanisms: (a) direct interference with the formation of Top2 cleavage
complexes and (b) Top2h down-regulation.
At present, it is not clear whether the antagonistic effect of
dexrazoxane on doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in H9C2
cardiomyocytes observed in the current study is relevant to the
protective effect of dexrazoxane against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity
in patients. However, it has been shown that the heart is one of the
tissues that prominently express the TOP2h mRNA in adult mice
(18). Interestingly, the TOP2a mRNA is completely absent in the
heart but still detectable in some other adult tissues, such as the
spleen and intestine (18). These findings indicate that Top2h is
the only Top2 isozyme that is present in the adult heart and
suggest that Top2h targeting by doxorubicin could contribute to its
toxic side effects (i.e., cardiotoxicity). In addition, it is known that
Top2h can be detected in mitochondria (48) and doxorubicin can
accumulate in mitochondria that are abundant in the heart (49).
These results suggest that Top2h targeting by doxorubicin in both
nuclei and mitochondria of cardiomyocytes could contribute to
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. However, we cannot rule out the
involvement of Top2h-independent mechanism(s) (50) for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, especially at higher doses of doxorubicin,

because the DNA damage signal g-H2AX is significantly reduced at
higher concentrations of doxorubicin (Figs. 1A and 3A).
Our current studies, therefore, may have relevance to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The two proposed mechanisms (see Fig. 6) for
the antagonistic effect of dexrazoxane on doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage may have interesting clinical implications. In
mechanism I, dexrazoxane stabilizes the closed-clamp form of
Top2 and thus prevents access of Top2 to chromosomal DNA.
Consequently, doxorubicin is unable to trap Top2 on chromosomal
DNA to form Top2-DNA covalent (cleavage) complexes. This
mechanism is not Top2 isozyme specific because dexrazoxane can
stabilize the closed-clamp forms of both Top2a and Top2h. In fact,
our homology modeling studies of the human Top2a and Top2h in
complex with dexrazoxane have indicated that the dexrazoxane
binding sites are the same for the two isozymes, with identical
interactions between dexrazoxane and the various amino acid side
chains. There are increasing evidence that the antitumor activity of
Top2-targeting drugs is primarily due to Top2a targeting in part
due to the overexpression of Top2a in tumor cells. Consequently,
dexrazoxane is expected to reduce the antitumor activity of
doxorubicin through mechanism I.
By contrast, dexrazoxane can down-regulate the Top2h isozyme
specifically through mechanism II (Fig. 6). Through this mechanism, dexrazoxane is expected not to have a major effect on the
Top2a isozyme level and hence the antitumor activity of
doxorubicin (and other Top2-targeting drugs). If indeed, dexrazoxane, used under the current clinical protocol, prevents doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity through both mechanisms, strategies should be
developed to prevent mechanism I and favor mechanism II. For
example, proper timing of dexrazoxane pretreatment during
doxorubicin-based chemotherapy may change the contribution
through these two mechanisms.
The idea that Top2 targeting is involved in doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity has significant clinical implications. It provides the
rationale for developing Top2a-specific anticancer drugs to prevent
tissue toxicities (i.e., cardiotoxicity) in patients receiving Top2based chemotherapy. It is also noteworthy that the involvement of
proteasome in Top2h-mediated DNA damage could suggest a novel
approach for preventing doxorubicin cardiotoxicity through the
combined use of bortezomib (or other proteasome inhibitor) and
doxorubicin.
