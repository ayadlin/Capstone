ABSTRACT:
The pathogenesis of BCC is associated with sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling.
Vismodegib, a smoothened inhibitor that targets this pathway, is now in clinical use
for advanced BCC patients, but its efficacy is limited. Therefore, new therapeutic
options for this cancer are required. We studied gene expression profiling of BCC
tumour tissues coupled with laser capture microdissection to identify tumour specific
receptor tyrosine kinase expression that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors.
We found a >250 fold increase (FDR<10-4) of the oncogene, anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) as well as its ligands, pleiotrophin and midkine in BCC compared to
microdissected normal epidermis. qRT-PCR confirmed increased expression of ALK
(p<0.05). Stronger expression of phosphorylated ALK in BCC tumour nests than
normal skin was observed by immunohistochemistry. Crizotinib, an FDA-approved
ALK inhibitor, reduced keratinocyte proliferation in culture, whereas a c-Met inhibitor
did not. Crizotinib significantly reduced the expression of GLI1 and CCND2 (members
of SHH-pathway) mRNA by approximately 60% and 20%, respectively (p<0.01). Our
data suggest that ALK may increase GLI1 expression in parallel with the conventional
SHH-pathway and promote keratinocyte proliferation. Hence, an ALK inhibitor alone or
in combination with targeting SHH-pathway molecules may be a potential treatment
for BCC patients.

INTRODUCTION

The sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is associated
with BCC development [3]. This pathway is highly
conserved across species, and it is responsible for
controlling embryonic development and adult tissue
homeostasis [4]. SHH binds to protein patched homolog
1 (PTCH1) and prevents PTCH1 from inhibiting
smoothened (SMO). PTCH1 inhibits SMO from
translocating to the cell membrane, thereby enhancing
degradation of SMO. In the absence of PTCH1, the GLIfamily proteins, key transcription factors downstream of
SMO, thereby turn on SHH-responsive genes, including

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common
human cancer with an estimate of well over one million
new cases diagnosed in the United States every year [1].
There are two main types of BCC: the less-aggressive
(nodular and superficial) and the aggressive (infiltrative/
morphea-like types). The morbidity from local invasion
and destruction of the surrounding tissue can cause severe
functional deficit and cosmetic disfigurement. However,
it rarely metastasizes or causes death [2].

many prosurvival and other transcription factors that are
essential for tumour growth and survival [5].
Mutations in PTCH1 can cause the development
of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also
known as Gorlin syndrome [6]. NBCCS is a predisposition
to large numbers of BCCs. NBCCS patients have an
inherited mutations at least one allele of the PTCH1
gene [6]. In sporadic BCC patients, it is also estimated
that loss of function mutations in PTCH1 occur in 3040%, while gain of function mutations in SMO are found
in approximately 10% [7, 8]. Both mutations result in
constitutive activation of SMO.
Treatment for BCC is largely achieved by surgical
excision or destruction, but there are select cases of locally
aggressive BCC where surgery may be complicated by
severe functional compromise. Other therapeutic options
include vismodegib, a recently FDA-approved SMO
inhibitor for treating advanced BCC patients, or immune
activation with imiquimod. These options, however, are
not effective for all BCC patients. Imiquimod can only
be used in superficial BCC [9]. It is also discouraging
that objective responses of vismodegib were only seen
in 30% of patients with metastatic BCC [10] and 43%
[10] or 58% [11] of patients with locally advanced BCC.
Therefore, further research in molecular mechanisms of
BCC development are needed, in order to develop better
therapies.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin
receptor superfamily [12]. It plays an important role in
brain and neuronal development during embryogenesis.
The expression of ALK is diminished in the adult;
however, it is still found in specific tissues of neuronal
origin. ALK is activated by its ligands, midkine
(MDK) and pleiotrophin (PTN), both of which serve
as mitogenic and angiogenic factors in cancer [13, 14].
ALK was initially identified as an oncogenic driver in
anaplastic large cell lymphoma [15, 16]. Chromosomal
translocations, resulting in fusion oncogene of ALK have
also been described in multiple cancers such as non-small
cell lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours,
and others [17-20]. Furthermore, a number of gain of
function point mutations in ALK have been identified
in neuroblastoma [21], pointing to the important role of
ALK in driving tumour development. An ALK inhibitor,
crizotinib, has been recently FDA approved as a therapy
for late stage non-small cell lung cancer with little side
effects [22, 23]. This makes ALK an intriguing target as a
therapy for many other cancers.
In this study, laser capture microdissection (LCM)
was performed in combination with cDNA microarray
analysis in order to discover molecular pathways that
distinguish BCC from normal epidermal keratinocytes.
We found that ALK was up-regulated by >250 fold in
BCC nodules and cognate activation of PTN and MDK
ligands also occurred. ALK was phosphorylated in BCC

tumour nests. Crizotinib reduced keratinocyte proliferation
in culture in part by suppressing the expression of SHH
signaling genes GLI1 and CCND2. Our data suggest that
ALK activates GLI1 in parallel with the conventional
SHH-pathway. Furthermore, ALK inhibitor alone or in
combination with targeting the SHH-pathway molecules
may be applicable for treating BCC patients.

RESULTS
Laser capture microdissection confirms previously
identified genes using bulk tissue extracts from
BCC tissue
Laser capture microdissection was performed
on both localized and infiltrative BCC (Figure 1A-F),
followed by RNA extraction, target amplification and
labeling, and hybridization onto Affymetrix HGU133A2.0
chips. In humans, BCC arises from the interfollicular
epidermis; hence gene expression profiles of both BCC
types were compared to those of microdissected epidermis
from healthy volunteers. Table 1 shows selected up- and
down-regulated genes among differentially expressed
genes (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.05, fold change
[FCH]>3.0). Many up-regulated genes in this short list
confirm the results from previous microarray studies of
BCC. Many keratinocyte differentiation marker genes
(KRT2, FLG, LOR, LCE2B, and CDSN) were found to
be down-regulated, but they were not detected in previous
gene expression studies [24-26]. This may be explained
by contamination of the normal epidermis within bulk
tissue, thus showing the specificity of our LCM method
to detect cancer cell specific gene expression changes. Six
up- and down-regulated genes (genes with an asterisk in
Table 1) were further tested for their mRNA expression
changes by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). All genes
were confirmed to be differentially expressed (p< 0.05,
Figure 1G-H), except for KLK11 expression in localized
BCC, which failed to reach statistical significance.
These findings showed a high correlation between
FCH estimated by both methods (Pearson’s r=0.96 and
Spearman’s ρ=0.86, p<0.0001 for both, Figure 1I). These
data support the consistency of our LCM derived gene sets
with previous studies using bulk tissue extracts, and the
accuracy of our gene sets.

ALK is overexpressed and phosphorylated in
BCC tissue
ALK was found to be among the top 3 up-regulated
genes for both types of BCCs with an approximately 250FCH in localized BCC, and an approximately 1000-FCH
in infiltrative BCC compared to microdissected normal

of ALK in microdissected BCC tissue was confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Figure 1G). In order to obtain a broad view
of the expression of ALK in skin diseases, qRT-PCR
using total RNA extracted from bulk tissues was carried
out. ALK expression was compared between different
hyperproliferative skin diseases, such as psoriasis
vulgaris and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There was a

to normal skin, psoriasis, and SCC (p<0.05, Figure 2A).
The phosphorylation status of ALK was evaluated in BCC,
as well as in SCC and normal skin. Positive cytoplasmic
staining of phosphorylated ALK (pALK) in all tumour
nests in BCC was found (Figure 2B). It was noted that it
also stained the basal layer of keratinocytes in normal skin

for the expression of PTN were then examined by double
immunofluorescence (IF), showing colocalized CD68
and PTN staining; this demonstrates that CD68 positive
myeloid lineage cells are producing PTN in BCC (Figure

ALK ligands, MDK and PTN, are up-regulated
in BCC
MDK and PTN, the two known ligands that bind
to ALK, were significantly up-regulated in BCC on our
gene list (FCH>20 and FCH>35, respectively, Table
1A). MDK and PTN were stained in BCC tissues by
immunohistochemistry (IHC). MDK was found in cells
within the tumour nests (Figure 2E), but there was no
staining in normal skin (Figure 2F). PTN was present in
cells at the periphery of the tumour nests (Figure 2G-H),
confirming the presence of both ligands within the BCC

proliferative nature of this cancer (Figure 3A). Double IF
staining using antibodies for pALK and Ki67 on human
BCC tissues was carried out. There was positive nuclear
staining of Ki67 and cytoplasmic staining of ALK within
the same tumour nests (Figure 3B). This suggests a
function of ALK in tumour proliferation in human BCC.
Giuriato et al. [27] have developed mice transduced
with NPM-ALK or TPM3-ALK fusion genes. These mice
develop skin tumours as well as lymphoma. The skin
tumours show follicular differentiation as evidenced by
the lack of granular layer, the existence of clear cells, and
architectural similarities of tumour compartments to the
hair shaft (Figure 3C). These mouse tumours are highly
proliferative as evidenced by PCNA staining (Figure
3D). As expected, ALK was positive in these tumours
(Figure 3E-F). GLI1 expression was also examined as

the SHH-pathway is known to be involved in hair follicle
morphogenesis. As shown in Figure 3G, GLI1 expression
at the peripheral area of the tumour nests was increased
compared to normal epidermis (Figure 3H). Overall, these
results associate the expression of ALK and GLI1 with
keratinocyte proliferation.

Crizotinib (PF-2341066, an ALK-inhibitor) is
an FDA-approved drug for treating non-small cell lung
cancer patients with a mutation in ALK. Since there are
no commercially available BCC cell lines to date, the

crizotinib was evaluated using cultured normal human
epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). The phosphorylation
status of ALK in cultured keratinocytes was first evaluated
by using flow cytometry analysis. ALK was consistently
phosphorylated in all three NHEKs tested (Figure 4A).
The mean of the median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was 1089, which was higher compared to the isotype
control antibody with a mean MFI of 284. Cells were then
cultured with or without crizotinib or a c-Met inhibitor
(PF-04217403) in media with full supplements. The
c-Met inhibitor at different doses was also included, as
it is known that crizotinib can also inhibit c-Met activity.
The number of keratinocytes in culture treated with
crizotinib for 5 days was significantly lower than control

(full media). A greater than 90% inhibition was observed
after treatment with crizotinib at both doses (Figure
4B, p<0.01). The c-Met inhibitor alone did not affect
keratinocyte growth (Figure 4B and 4C-G). This further
supports the role of ALK in regulating proliferation of
keratinocytes.

DISCUSSION

crizotinib (an ALK inhibitor), mRNA expression of the
SHH-pathway genes was evaluated after 24 and 48 hour
treatment with indicated inhibitors and PBS as a control.
The expression of each gene for each condition was
normalized to that of control (PBS alone). The expression
of GLI1 was significantly down-regulated in the cells
after 24 hour treatment with 1000ng/ml of crizotinib
(p<0.05, Figure 5A) and it was further suppressed after
48 hours with 500 ng/ml and 1000ng/ml of crizotinib
(p<0.0001, Figure 5B). This suppression after 48 hour
treatment with 1000ng/ml of crizotinib was obvious with
an approximately 60% reduction compared to PBS. The
expression of PTCH1 did not change after 24 hour culture
with any treatment tested, whereas it was reduced after 48
hour culture with 500ng/ml and 1000ng/ml of crizotinib
(p<0.01, Figure 5C-D). The expression of CCND2 was
significantly down-regulated by 1000ng/ml of crizotinib
after 48 hours (p<0.01, Figure 5F). This was also observed
even in the cells after 24 hour culture with 500ng/ml and
1000ng/ml of crizotinib (p<0.01, Figure 5E). There was
a dose dependent manner of the effect of the crizotinib to
reduce each gene expression.

There is an increasing trend to treat specific cancers
with cell-specific or pathway-specific antagonists [2932]. In BCC, vismodegib has been recently approved by
FDA for metastatic and locally advanced disease. This
drug blocks the signaling from SMO to GLI1, resulting
in the down-regulation of the SHH-pathway. It is well
documented that the constitutive activation of the SHHpathway, mainly due to loss of function mutations in
PTCH1 or gain of function mutations in SMO, is present
in the majority of NBCCS and sporadic BCC cases.
However, results from first clinical trial of vismodegib
were somewhat discouraging with a 30% response rate for
metastatic and a 43% response rate for locally advanced
BCC [10], followed by a report with a 58% response rate
for locally advanced BCC [11]. In addition, drug resistance
has been recently reported in 6 out of 20 locally advanced
BCC patients during vismodegib treatment [33]. These
data suggest that there may be alternative mechanisms
that activate GLI1 in BCC. Another concern regarding
the use of vismodegib is the fact that about 50% patients
discontinued the drug due to its severe adverse effects [10,
34]. Thus, finding new therapeutic options for this cancer
is essential.
In this study, we identified a new function of ALK
in keratinocyte proliferation, as well as in activation of
GLI1 signaling. The activation of GLI1 transcription
factor by ALK was reported in a lymphoma cell line
and was ascribed to signaling through PI3/Akt [28]. The
function of ALK in keratinocytes has not been determined
to date. This coordinate regulation of GLI1 expression by
the conventional SHH-pathway and ALK is particularly
interesting when put into the context of BCC biology. In
fact, we found the overexpression of ALK mRNA in all
22 BCC cases studied. In a mouse model of BCC, it was
suggested that the degree of expression of GLI1 or GLI2

The SHH-pathway genes are up-regulated in BCC
tissue
Finally, the expression of the SHH-pathway, known
to be associated with BCC development, was evaluated
in our nodular and infiltrative BCC transcriptomes.
PTCH1, PTCH2, SMO, and key transcription factors of
this pathway GLI1 and GLI2 were all up-regulated (Figure
6A). Up-regulation of four of these genes was further
confirmed by qRT-PCR using the same LCM-derived
RNA that we used for microarray analysis. SMO, PTCH1,
GLI1, and GLI2 were all elevated in BCC compared to
LCM normal epidermis (Figure 6B).

has a critical impact on the development of BCC tumours
[35]. In this regard, our data suggest that ALK may have a
function in enhancing GLI1 expression in BCC in parallel
to signaling through SMO activation. A proposed role of
ALK in BCC is summarized in Figure 7.
The feasibility of the use of ALK inhibitor in
treating BCC is also supported by mouse models. There
are mice transduced with NPM-ALK or TPM3-ALK
fusion genes [27]. These mutations are known to lead to
constitutive activation of ALK and are found in anaplastic
lymphoma patients in humans [15, 16]. Thus, these mice
were established as models of anaplastic lymphoma.
Unexpectedly, these mice established keratinocytic
tumours on their skin as well. While analyzing these
skin lesions by H&E, we noticed the trichilemmal
keratinization and strong expression of ALK and GLI1
within the tumours. These features in part overlap with
BCC, which is often considered as a tumour with features
of hair follicle differentiation [36]. Most importantly,
these tumours were completely diminished when these
mice were treated with crizotinib [27]. Taken together,

our observations in both human BCC and mice suggest
that ALK plays an important role in BCC growth, and
therefore holds great potential as a therapeutic target for
BCC.
The limitation of this study is a lack of direct
evidence of the effect of ALK inhibitor on human BCC
cells. However, it should be noted that there are no well
established and fully characterized human BCC cell
lines. Mouse models of BCC do not properly recapitulate
human BCC. For example, some mice BCC model harbor
mutations in GLI2 [37], which is very rarely seen in
humans. The structure of mouse skin features follicular
differentiation of keratinocytes; hence skin tumour
pathology of the ALK transgene is a reflection of this
differentiation bias in mouse skin.
In summary, an oncogene ALK was highly upregulated in BCC. Our data suggest that ALK activates
GLI1 in parallel with the conventional SHH-pathway
and thus these distant surface molecules may cooperate
or synergize in signal transduction. Given the fact that
crizotinib is an already FDA approved drug, we believe

Figure 7: ALK may activate GLI1 in a coordinate fashion with the conventional SHH-pathway in BCC. This scheme

demonstrates our model of activation of GLI1 in BCC. It is known that nevoid basal carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) patients and up to 50%
of sporadic BCC patients harbor either loss of function mutations in PTCH1 or gain of function mutations in SMO, resulting in constitutive
activation of the SHH-pathway. Our data presented here showed that all (n=22) cases of BCC overexpressed ALK at a genomic level with
a FCH>250. Known ALK ligands MDK and PTN exist in the BCC microenvironment at a protein level, thus ligands-receptor binding
may occur. Indeed, phosphorylation of ALK in BCC tumour nests was confirmed by IHC with specific antibody against phosphorylated
ALK. The effect of ALK in the regulation of GLI1 mRNA expression as well as its downstream molecule CCND2 was confirmed in
normal human epidermal keratinocytes in culture with crizotinib, an FDA approved ALK inhibitor. Overall, these data suggest that GLI1
expression in BCC may be regulated by signaling through phospshorylation of ALK in parallel with the conventional SHH-pathway. This
may in part explain the relatively limited response rate of vismodegib, an FDA approved SMO inhibitor, against BCC. Targeting ALK with
ALK inhibitor alone or in combination with other therapies such as vismodegib may provide new therapeutic options for treating BCC
patients.

that clinical trials using crizotinib alone or in combination
with other therapies such as vismodegib are indicated.

NHEKs were purchased from PromoCell and
cultured in the appropriate media. An ALK inhibitor
(crizotinib, PF-2341066) and a c-Met inhibitor (PF04217403) were purchased from Selleck.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The detailed protocols and statistical analysis are
described in the supplemental materials and methods.

Flow cytometry

Patients and Samples

Suspensions of cultured NHEKs were stained
according to standard procedures with anti-phospho ALK
antibody or appropriate isotype control (Epitomics).
Samples were acquired using the LSR II flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed with Flowjo software
(TreeStar Inc).

Institutional review board approval(Rockefeller
University and Weill Cornell Medical University) and
written informed consent were obtained before enrolling
patients to participate in this study. The study was
performed in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki
Principals. A total of 10 BCC samples were obtained
during Mohs micrographic surgery.

Statistical analysis

LCM

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit
(QIAGEN).

Microarray data was analyzed using R/Bioconductor
packages. The Harshlight package [39] was used to scan
Affymetrix chips for spatial artifacts. Expression values
were obtained using the GCRMA-algorithm. Expression
values were modeled using the mixed-effect framework
of Bioconductor’s limma package. Genes with FDR<0.05
and FCH>3.0 were considered as differentially expressed
genes. Repeating measures ANOVA with adjusting p
values using Dunnet’s method was used to evaluate the
results from RT-PCR. P<0.05 was considered significant.

cDNA microarray analysis

FUNDING

LCM was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol for the CellCut system (Molecular
Machines and Industries).

RNA extraction

This study was supported by the Milstein Medical
Program and in part by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) grant 8 KL2 TR000151 to HM, CQW, MS-F, KRS,
CI, and JGK; the NIH grant 8 UL1b TR000043 from
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences to
JG; the Frederick J. and Theresa Dow Wallace Fund of
the New York Community Trust to JC and DF; and the
Dana Foundation Human Immunology Consortium Grant
to JAC.

Target amplification and labeling was performed
as reported previously [38]. Affymetrix HGU133A2.0
arrays were used. The data has been deposited at the Gene
Expression Omnibus repository (GSE42109).

qRT-PCR
Standard TaqMan RT-PCR and pre-amplification
RT-PCR methods (Applied Biosystems) were performed.
All data were normalized to RPLP0/hARP. All primers
and probes used in this study are listed in Table S1.
