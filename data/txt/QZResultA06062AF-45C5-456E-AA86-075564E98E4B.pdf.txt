ABSTRACT
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a differentiating agent for the treatment of
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, the therapeutic efficacy of ATRA has
limitations. Tetrandrine is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb extract with antitumor
effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of tetrandrine on human PML-RARαpositive acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Tetrandrine inhibited tumors in vivo. It
induced autophagy and differentiation by triggering ROS generation and activating
Notch1 signaling. Tetrandrine induced autophagy and differentiation in M5 type
patient primary leukemia cells. The in vivo results indicated that low concentrations
of tetrandrine inhibited leukemia cells proliferation and induced autophagy and
then facilitated their differentiation, by activating ROS and Notch1 signaling. We
suggest that tetrandrine is a potential agent for the treatment of APL by inducing
differentiation of leukemia cells.

INTRODUCTION

agent [4, 5]. Differentiation agents are involved in the
reprogramming of cancer cells, which results in repressing
their proliferation and inducing the terminal maturation of
cells, even inducing apoptosis and, ultimately, cell death
[6-8]. Differentiation therapy is less toxic than classical
chemotherapy, which not only kills cancer cells but also
has side effects on normal cells. Clinically, all-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) alone or in combination with arsenic
trioxide (ATO) treatment targets the RARα and induces
terminal differentiation of APL blasts [9-12]. Although the
rate of remission for APL patients after ATRA treatment
is high, the therapeutic efficacy of ATRA still has some
challenges, including liver toxicity, secondary resistance
and some cases of ATRA-resistant APL patients [13-15].
The gradually revealed limitations of ATRA treatment for
APL patients indicates that it is necessary to find more
useful therapeutic agents that have the capacity to increase
the level of ATRA sensitivity of leukemic cells or have the
ability to “cure” APL on their own [16].
Autophagy is a ubiquitous and dynamic cellular
process that involves the rearrangement of subcellular

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous
clonal disorder of hemopoietic progenitor cells. The clonal
disorder is resulting from the accumulation of clonal
myeloid progenitor cells that are unable to differentiate
normally. AML is the most common malignant myeloid
disorder in adults [1]. Acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL) is a distinct subtype of AML that is characterized
by a specific chromosome translocation, which results in
the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and
the retinoic acid receptor α gene (RARα) [2]. The aberrant
oncogenic protein (PML-RARα) blocks further myeloid
differentiation at the promyelocyte stage [3]. Currently,
NB4 cell line is a good model to study APL, as it is a
human PML–RAR α-positive APL cell line.
Differentiation therapy focuses on forcing cancer
cells to restore their differentiation capacity and achieve
terminal differentiation, which has successfully been
applied in APL. Initially, APL became the first model
of a malignant disease responding to a differentiation

components and organelles in cytoplasm for delivery to
the lysosome or vacuoles where the sequestered cargo,
such as proteins and lipids, are degraded and recycled
[17, 18]. Autophagy is a double-edged sword in the
modulation of cancer; experimental evidence supports
a role for autophagy in both cancer development and
suppression [19]. Increasing evidence proved that
activation of autophagy by multiple signaling pathways
is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer [20-22]. It
been demonstrated that autophagy regulates myeloid cell
differentiation by p62/SQSTM1-mediated degradation
of the PML-RARα oncoprotein [23, 24]. Specific roles
for autophagy have also been identified in lymphocytes,
plasma and monocyte–macrophage cell differentiation
[25-28]. Therefore, enhancing autophagy may be a
promising therapeutic treatment for facilitating cellular
differentiation in resistant APL.
Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, is
a key ingredient isolated from the roots of broadly used
traditional Chinese medicinal herb Stephaniae tetrandrae
[29-31], which exhibits potent antitumor effects. We
previously reported that high concentrations of tetrandrine
effectively induce apoptosis, and low doses of tetrandrine
induce cellular autophagy in liver cancer cells and show
good synergistic antitumor effects in combination with
other chemotherapeutic agents [32-34]. Interestingly,
we also found that tetrandrine is a potent agonist for cell
autophagy in many types of cancer cells and even exhibits
a much stronger activity than rapamycin for inducing
autophagy [35].
In the present study, we investigated the efficacy
of tetrandrine on NB4 cells in vivo and in vitro. The
results revealed that tetrandrine has the capacity to induce
differentiation accompanied by autophagy and inhibit
proliferation in NB4 cells. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) accumulation and Notch1 signaling activation
were involved in the tetrandrine-induced autophagy
and differentiation. Moreover, tetrandrine also induced
autophagy and differentiation in M5 type patient
primary leukemia cells. These findings provide a novel
chemotherapeutic strategy for APL, even in AML patients,
with the development of tetrandrine as a differentiationinducing agent.

intragastrically treated with vehicle or tetrandrine (25
mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) once daily for 20 days. Mouse body
weight and tumor size were measured daily. As shown as
Fig. 1A, tetrandrine inhibited tumor growth. Consistent
with the tumor volume results, tetrandrine treatment also
led to a slowed the increase in tumor weight (Fig. 1B).
Notably, we found no additional weight loss or other signs
of toxicity, even in mice treated with 50 mg/kg tetrandrine
for 3 weeks (Fig. 1C). Additionally, Western blot analysis
of tumor tissue samples found that tetrandrine increased
LC3-II protein levels and activated the Notch1 signaling
pathway (Fig. 1D). Moreover, tetrandrine also upregulated
CD14 expression on the NB4 cell surface in vivo (Fig.
1E). Additionally, the level of the lipid peroxidation
product MDA, used as a presumptive measure of ROS,
was increased in tumor tissues upon tetrandrine treatment
(Fig. 1F). These observations suggest that tetrandrine
exhibited good anti-tumor activity in vivo, and the
potential mechanism was associated with the induction
of tumor cell autophagy and differentiation by triggering
ROS generation and activation of Notch1 signaling.

Tetrandrine-induced
autophagy
and
differentiation in M5 type patient primary
leukemia cells
M5 leukemia, or acute monocytic leukemia, is one
of the most common subtypes of AML. To assess the
effects of tetrandrine on human primary leukemia cells,
we treated primary leukemia cells obtained from M5 type
patients who had not previously received chemotherapy.
The results showed that tetrandrine treatment dramatically
promoted LC3 protein expression as well as an increased
accumulation of acidic autophagolysosome vacuoles
(Fig. 2A and B). In addition, tetrandrine treatment also
facilitated the expression of CD11b and CD14 on the
surface of M5 type patient cells (Fig. 2C). These results
revealed that tetrandrine exhibited considerable effects on
the differentiation of M5 type patient primary leukemia
cells.

leukemia cell line

RESULTS

We have previously reported that tetrandrine exhibits
potent antitumor effects in solid cancer. To determine the
effects of tetrandrine on acute promyelocytic leukemia,
NB4 cells were treated with 0 (DMSO), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,
or 3 μM tetrandrine for 24, 48 or 72 hours. The results
showed that tetrandrine inhibited cell proliferation at 0.52 μM (Fig. 3A). To exclude the possibility that cell death
reduced the number of cells, cell viability was assayed and
the result showed that tetrandrine hardly kill NB4 cells at
concentrations of 0-2 μM (Fig. 3B). Thus, we concluded

Tetrandrine induces NB4 cell autophagy and
differentiation and represses tumor growth in vivo
To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of tetrandrine in
vivo, we established NB4 subcutaneous tumor xenograft
models with athymic nude mice. Nude mice bearing NB4
tumors (approximate volume 50 mm3) were randomly
divided into three groups (8 mice/group) and were

that tetrandrine primarily inhibited NB4 cell proliferation
at a 2 μM concentration. However, 3 μM tetrandrine
significantly induced apoptosis in NB4 cells (Fig. 3C).
Further cell cycle analysis indicated that 2 μM tetrandrine
treatment for 48 hours resulted in a G0/G1 phase arrest
of NB4 cells (Fig. 3D). Western blots demonstrated that
tetrandrine dramatically promoted the expression of the
cyclin-dependent-kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27kip1 and the
p21 protein (Fig. 3E and F) but did not affect cyclinD,
cyclinE and CDKs protein levels (data not shown).
Therefore, we speculated that tetrandrine inhibits NB4 cell
proliferation by regulating p27kip1 and p21 expression to
cause cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.

cell autophagy. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, tetrandrine
markedly increased the levels of LC3-II and p62, which
are established markers of cell autophagy, in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. However, poly (ADP)-ribose
polymerase (PARP), the marker for apoptosis, was not
increased with 2 μM tetrandrine treatment. To further
confirm this observation, we stained NB4 cells with
acridine orange and detected the formation of numerous
acidic autophagolysosome vacuoles (AVOs) with multiple
test methods. The data showed that 2 μM tetrandrine
resulted in a considerable accumulation of intracellular
autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 4C, D and E). The above results
findings indicate that 2 μM tetrandrine led to NB4 cell
autophagy.

maturation by observing the cellular morphology with
Wright-Giemsa staining. As shown in Fig. 5A, NB4 cells
treated with tetrandrine had the typical characteristic
morphology of differentiated cells, such as an irregular
nucleus, the presence of vacuoles and a large nuclear/
cytoplasm ratio. Next, we further predicted NB4 cell
differentiation by analyzing the expression of the cell
surface differentiation-related antigens, CD14 and
CD11b. The results revealed that 2 μM tetrandrine
enhanced CD14 and CD11b expression on the NB4 cell
surface, either alone or in combination, as shown by
immunofluorescence labeling of these two proteins. In
contrast, 1 μM tetrandrine did not significantly induce
NB4 cell differentiation (Fig. 5B, C and D). The NBT
reduction assay, which is a classic experiment to detect
cellular differentiation, also found that NBT reduction
activity increased remarkably with tetrandrine treatment
and reached a peak value at 48 hours (Fig. 5E). MMP9
levels can be used as an additional NB4 cell differentiation

marker. Here, we also observed that tetrandrine treatment
promoted a significant increase of MMP9 mRNA levels
(Fig. 5F). Thus, these results suggest that 2 μM tetrandrine
promoted NB4 cell differentiation.

Early stage autophagy is related to tetrandrineinduced differentiation
Recent reports show that autophagy is a potentially
important regulator of differentiation in anti-leukemic
strategies. Therefore, we next investigated whether
tetrandrine-induced differentiation is related to autophagy.
3-methyladenine (3-MA), a common specific inhibitor
of early stage autophagy through the blockade of
autophagosome maturation, was used to block tetrandrineinduced autophagy. The results showed that 3-MA not
only significantly prevented the formation of the AVO
fluorescent orange puncta and the LC3-II protein level

The activation of Notch1 signaling is involved
in tetrandrine-induced NB4 cell autophagy and
differentiation

(Fig. 6A and B) but also inhibited tetrandrine-induced
differentiation (Fig. 6C). To examine the relationship of
late-stage autophagy and cell differentiation, we treated
NB4 cells with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) to
inhibit late autophagy/lysosomal protein degradation and
break the autophagic flux. As shown as Fig. 6D and E,
while CQ blocked late-stage autophagic flux, it showed
a synergistic induction of differentiation in combination
with tetrandrine. These findings suggest that tetrandrineinduced NB4 cell differentiation is associated with early
stage but not late-stage autophagy.

Notch is a critical signaling intermediate that
regulates hematopoietic cell differentiation through
downstream signal transduction cascades. To determine
the role of Notch1 signaling activity in tetrandrineinduced cell autophagy and differentiation, we evaluated
the mRNA levels of HES1, HES5 and Notch1. As
shown in Fig. 7A, tetrandrine treatment dramatically
up-regulated HES1 mRNA levels. Western blots also
showed that tetrandrine treatment increased the levels of
the NICD and HES1 proteins (Fig. 7B), which suggests
that tetrandrine activates Notch1 signaling. Interestingly,
pretreatment with DAPT, an established Notch signaling

of the LC3-II protein and the numbers of AVO fluorescent
orange puncta (Fig. 7C and D) and down-regulated the
levels of CD14 expression on the surface of NB4 cells

regulates cell proliferation, survival and differentiation.
Therefore, we next investigated whether ROS activation
played an essential role in tetrandrine-induced NB4
cell autophagy and differentiation. Using H2DCFDAbased detection by flow cytometry, dose-dependent ROS
accumulation was observed after tetrandrine treatment
of NB4 cells (Fig. 8A). The free radical scavenger NAC
and Tiron markedly abrogated tetrandrine-induced ROS
generation (Fig. 8B). Importantly, pretreatment with NAC
and Tiron markedly blocked tetrandrine-induced cell
autophagy by decreasing AVO fluorescent orange puncta
and the levels of the LC3-II protein and prevented cell
differentiation by down-regulating the expression of CD14

NAC notably recovered the tetrandrine-induced increase
in NICD and HES1 protein levels (Fig. 8D). Taken
together, these results demonstrated that activation of

autophagy and differentiation and that ROS act upstream

efficiency in APL patients is achieved by a combination
of ATRA with arsenic trioxide (ATO) [12, 36, 37], the
development of chemotherapeutic differentiation therapies
is still limited. Hence, developing specific agents that can
trigger differentiation of leukemic cells along normal
hematopoietic lineages has become necessary. Tetrandrine
was suggested to be an autophagy agonist for solid tumors
in our previous studies. Here, we demonstrated that
tetrandrine had notable effects on NB4 tumor growth
repression, including the induction of cell cycle arrest,
autophagy, differentiation, ROS accumulation, and
Notch1 signaling activation, not only in vitro but also in
vivo. Some other reports indicated that the ROS scavenger
NAC can inhibits mTOR [38], but it proved in our system

that accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) involved in tetrandrine induced autophagy and
NAC can block this autophagy induction without inducing
significant autophagy itself, and whether NAC can activate
autophagy by inhibiting mTOR needs futher exploration.
As tetrandrine comes from natural plant product, it
has multiple bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory,
anti-allergic, anti-fibrogenic, and antitumor activities.
Anticancer activity is most hot area among the masses
of pharmacological effects displayed by tetrandrine. It
may have multi-targets of treating cancer and the cells
are undergoing various forms of dynamic process after
drug treatment. Differentiation is one of the main points
in tetrandrine treated NB4 cells, as well as proliferation
inhibition and autophagy induction, but other targets may
still exist and will be functional. Tetrandrine displays these
effects through selective modulation of multiple signaling
pathways. Anti-tumor is the sum of a variety of effects.
Since most tumorigenesis involved complicated process,

targeting drug may not enough to approach effective
therapeutic effect, multiple bioactivities attributed to drugs
such as tetrandrine actually make tetrandrine become a
potent candidate in therapeutics. Therefore, our findings
indicated that in addition to solid cancer, tetrandrine also
exhibits potent antitumor effects on acute promyelocytic
leukemia and may provide a novel chemotherapeutic
strategy for APL patients.
Because APL pathogenesis includes blocking the
myeloid differentiation program and enhancing the selfrenewal of leukemic cells, targeting differentiation is an
effective therapy for APL. To evaluate the potential of
tetrandrine to induce NB4 leukemia cell differentiation,
we examined CD14 and CD11b expression on the cell
surface. Although a slight change of CD11b was observed
after tetrandrine treatment, the membrane antigen density
of CD14 was markedly increased, which suggested that
NB4 cells differentiated into mature monocytes and
macrophages. In contrast, ATRA effectively facilitated the

differentiation of APL cells into mature granulocytes, as
assessed by CD11b surface expression. Previous reports
showed that ATRA induced APL cell differentiation by
activation of RARα and induced the degradation of PMLRARα by changing epigenetic modifiers from co-repressor
complexes to co-activator complexes on target genes.
Here, we demonstrated that tetrandrine promoted NB4
cell differentiation primarily through triggering ROS and
Notch1 signaling pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized
that tetrandrine had different molecular mechanisms of
inducing leukemia cell differentiation compared with
ATRA. More interestingly, tetrandrine-induced leukemia
cell differentiation is very likely autophagy-dependent.
Autophagy is one of several proteolytic mechanisms
and is an efficient way to promote the degradation of
the redundant abnormal oncogenic fusion protein that
promotes the further differentiation of abnormal cells. The
elimination of the special PML-RARα oncogenic fusion
protein is critical to obtain complete and sustained APL
remission [20, 39]. P62/SQSTM1 is an ubiquitin-binding
adaptor protein that binds ubiquitin and regulates signaling
cascades through ubiquitination. P62 connects the
ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways
to mediate degradation of intracellular proteins. In our
study, after tetrandrine-induced autophagy was blocked
by 3-MA (a common specific inhibitor of autophagy
at early stage) pretreatment in the autophagosome
formation stage, tetrandrine-induced differentiation also
decreased, which indicated that tetrandrine-induced
autophagy contributes to the differentiation of leukemia
cells. However, CQ treatment to inhibit autophagylysosome protein degradation showed that tetrandrine
and CQ were synergistic for inducing differentiation. This
may be explained because the CQ autophagy inhibitor
increased the accumulation of some proteins that are
dependent on the inhibition of autophagosome maturation
and degradation, which benefits cell differentiation
by potentiating drug-induced growth arrest and the
differentiation of leukemic cells [4, 40]. Thus, it is possible
that autophagy is involved in the breakdown of aggregates
of oncogenic fusion proteins, such as PML–RAR α, and
also takes part in other pathways that have effects on cell
differentiation.
Notch signaling is a highly evolutionarily conserved
pathway that is involved in stem cell maintenance and
developmental processes by regulating cell fate decisions
[41]. Although Notch signaling has been shown to play
both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in cancer,
depending on the cell type, increasing evidence has
demonstrated the importance of Notch1 signaling in
hematopoietic development and leukemia therapy
[42], especially in AML and T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL) [43, 44]. Moreover, Notch1 agonists
have been reported as a potential therapeutic approach in
AML [45, 46]. In our studies, we found that tetrandrine
induced NB4 differentiation by activating Notch1

signaling, which confirmed that Notch1 signaling may
be an APL suppressor pathway. Though the detailed
molecular mechanisms need to be further explored, the
present results are sufficient to suggest that tetrandrine or
other Notch signaling inducers possess good therapeutic
prospects for leukemia patients in clinical treatment.
In conclusion, following our previous report on the
role of tetrandrine in human hepatocellular carcinoma, we
show here that tetrandrine is a promising chemotherapeutic
agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia. Tetrandrine
can inhibit NB4 cell growth and induces autophagyassociated differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. The
potential molecular mechanisms of tetrandrine involve
ROS accumulation and Notch1 signaling activation, which
acted as an essential initial signal to facilitate tetrandrineinduced NB4 cell autophagy and differentiation.
Therefore, our data broaden the application of tetrandrine
in clinical therapies and provide the rationale for the
therapeutic regimens for leukemia patients as well.

and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with TBST,
the immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence
using a HRP substrate (Millipore). GAPDH was probed to
ensure equal protein loading.

Cell proliferation was measured by counting the
total number of cells. Cell viability was observed by the
trypan blue dye-exclusion assay. Cells were plated on
96-well plates and incubated with various concentrations
of tetrandrine for the indicated times. A 10μl aliquot of
cell suspension was incubated with 10μl 0.4% trypan
blue solution for 5 minutes at room temperature. Viable
and nonviable cells based on absence and presence of
intracellular trypan blue dye, respectively. Percentages
were counted by hemacytometer .

Acridine orange staining assays
Acridine orange staining for detecting and
quantifying autophagy was measured by fluorescence
microscopy and flow cytometry. Autophagy is
characterized by the formation of acidic vesicular
organelles (AVO), such as autophagosomes and
autolysosomes. The intensity of the red fluorescence is
proportional to the degree of acidity. Cells were collected
and the cell suspension was stained with AO (100 μg/mL)
for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS, resuspended
in 0.4 mL PBS and quantified by flow cytometry (Guava
technologies). The AO fluorescence was also viewed under
a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH).
AVOs were accumulated in acidic spaces and exhibited
bright red punctuate fluorescence in the cytoplasm.

Cell apoptosis assay
For the apoptosis assay, cells were washed with
PBS, resuspended in binding buffer from BD Biosciences
and stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide
(PI) for 15 min. Annexin V fluorescence was measured
with a flow cytometer, and the membrane integrity of the
cells was simultaneously assessed by the PI exclusion
method.

Measurement of ROS accumulation

Cell cycle analysis

Intracellular ROS levels were detected by flow
cytometry using the DCFH-DA probe (Sigma). Briefly,
with the cells were treated with tetrandrine for the
indicated time intervals, harvested and washed twice with
PBS before being incubated with DCFH-DA (1 μM) in
serum-free RPMI 1640 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for
20 minutes. Next, the cells were washed twice with PBS
and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were processed
using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA,
USA).

The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry
(Guava Technologies, Inc.). After treatment, cells were
harvested, washed with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 ×
g at 25 °C for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the
cells were washed with PBS. Then, the cells were stained
with 4 μl of 10 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 10 μl of
1 mg/ml RNase in 400 μl PBS, followed by incubation in
the dark for 30 min prior to measurement of the stained
cells on a flow cytometer (Beckman, Indianapolis, CA,
USA). The results were analyzed using FlowJo software
(Tree Star, San Carlos, USA).

Observation of morphological changes

Western blot analysis

The cellular morphology of NB4 cells was observed
by Wright–Giemsa staining. Cells were fixed with absolute
methanol for 30 min, stained with Wright–Giemsa solution
(Wako) and observed under a light microscope. ATRA
treatment (1 μM) was used as a positive control.

The cells were harvested and lysed in 1% SDS on
ice. Then, the cell lysates were heated at 95 °C for 1520 minutes and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10
minutes. The supernatant was collected, and the protein
concentration was determined by the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Equivalent amounts of
protein (20 μg) from each sample were loaded and run
on SDS-PAGE gels (Amresco) and transferred to PVDF
membranes (Millipore). After blocking the membranes
with 5% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) in
Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at room
temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated
with specific primary antibodies at 4 ºC overnight,
washed with TBST three times (10 minutes per wash),

Differentiation marker analysis
The expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens on the
surface of NB4 cells was measured by flow cytometry.
Cells were treated for 4 days, and after washing with PBS,
1.0 × 105 cells were labeled with CD14 (CD14-FITC)
and CD11b (CD11b-PE) antibodies for 30 min on ice
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells
were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and finally
resuspended in 500 μL PBS for measurement. CD14

and CD11b expression levels were measured using flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). FACS data
were analyzed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star, San
Carlos, USA). ATRA treatment (1 μM) was used as a
positive control.

week-old male athymic nude mice (BALB/c, nu/nu)
were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center
(Changsha, China). All experiments were conducted under
approved procedures. All qualified mice were injected in
the right flank with 1x107 NB4 cells suspended in 0.2
ml of PBS. Tumor growth and the body weight of the
mice were monitored every day. Fourteen days later,
tumor lumps had reached approximately 50 mm, and
tumor-bearing mice were randomly grouped into three
experimental categories: vehicle (1% methylcellulose)
or one of two concentrations of tetrandrine, 25 or 50
mg/kg body weight tetrandrine. Each group of mice was
administered the respective treatment for 3 weeks. Mouse
weights and tumor volumes were measured and recorded
daily. Tumor volumes were calculated as length*width2/2.

NBT reduction assay
For the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction
measurements, cells were treated with tetrandrine
for several days in 12-well plates as indicated. After
incubation, each cell suspension was mixed with an
equal volume of RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml NBT
(Sigma) and 20ng/ml TPA for 20 min at 37 °C. The
cells were washed in PBS and suspended in 100 μl PBS
before evaluation using multimode microplate readers
(SpectraMax M5) at 570 nm.

Tissue protein isolation and malondialdehyde
(MDA) assay

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Mice were sacrificed after 20 days of treatment,
and tumor tissues were extracted, washed in PBS and
then stored at -80 °C. For the Western blot assay, the
tumor tissue was lysed in RIPA buffer on ice and was
sonicated to destroy large particles. The cytosol from the
tissues was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C to
harvest the supernatant, and the proteins were subjected
to Western blot analysis, as described previously. For the
MDA assay, tissue proteins were prepared according to
the manufacturer’s instructions for the Lipid Peroxidation
MDA assay kit (Beyotime). The MDA concentration of
each sample was evaluated by multimode microplate
readers (SpectraMax M5) at 532 nm using 490 nm as a
control.

For quantitative analysis of gene expression,
total RNA was isolated using a TRIzol kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Complementary DNA was synthesized
using a complementary DNA synthesis kit (Thermo
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In each reaction, the GAPDH was used as an internal
control. The primers used for PCR were as follows:
MMP9,
5’-GTCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCAG-3’
(forward) and 5’-CTTATGTGTAGGAGAGGATAAG-3’
(reverse);
HES1,
5’-TGGAAATGACAGTGAAGCACCT-3’ (forward) and
5’-GTTCATGCACTCGCTGAAGC-3’ (reverse); HES5,
5’-GGAAGCCGGTGGTGGAGAAGAT-3’ (forward)
and 5’-TCCTGCAGGCACCACGAGTAGC-3’ (reverse);
NOTCH1,
5’-GCTGCCTCTTTGATGGCTTCGA-3’
(forward) and 5’-CACATTCGGCACTGTTACAGCC-3’
(reverse)
and
GAPDH,
5’-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3’
(forward)
and
5’-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3’
(reverse).
Relative quantities of mRNA were measured using
Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(PerkinElmer , Torrance , CA ) and double-stranded DNA
dye SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Roche Life Science,
US). Amplification was performed with 40 cycles at 95 °
C for 15 seconds and at 60° C for 30 seconds. Data were
analyzed using 7500 system SDS software and the data
normalized to GAPDH gene expression.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on
paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections.
Tumor samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
solution and tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut
at 5 μm. After deparaffinization and appropriate epitope
retrieval, the sections were incubated with rabbit antiNotch1 and rabbit anti-CD14 antibodies. The sections
were further incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
antibodies. The specific signals were then detected with
streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and with
the use of diaminobenzidine as the chromogen.

Statistical analysis

Tumor xenograft assay

The results are expressed as the means ± standard
deviation (SD), and all statistical analyses were performed
using Student’s t-test (two-tailed, unpaired). A P-value of
0.05 or less was considered significant.

Animal experiments were conducted according
to the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Center of
the Wuhan University College of Life Sciences. Fivewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
