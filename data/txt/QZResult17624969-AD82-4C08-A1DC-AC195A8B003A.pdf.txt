ABSTRACT
EBV infection causes mononucleosis and is associated with specific subsets of
B cell lymphomas. Immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant recipients
are particularly susceptible to EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease (LPD),
which can be fatal. Leflunomide (a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis) and
its active metabolite teriflunomide (used to treat multiple sclerosis) inhibit de
novo pyrimidine synthesis by targeting the cellular dihydroorotate dehydrogenase,
thereby decreasing T cell proliferation. Leflunomide also inhibits the replication of
cytomegalovirus and BK virus via both “on target” and “off target” mechanisms and
is increasingly used to treat these viruses in organ transplant recipients. However,
whether leflunomide/teriflunomide block EBV replication or inhibit EBV-mediated
B cell transformation is currently unknown. We show that teriflunomide inhibits
cellular proliferation, and promotes apoptosis, in EBV-transformed B cells in vitro
at a clinically relevant dose. In addition, teriflunomide prevents the development
of EBV-induced lymphomas in both a humanized mouse model and a xenograft
model. Furthermore, teriflunomide inhibits lytic EBV infection in vitro both by
preventing the initial steps of lytic viral reactivation, and by blocking lytic viral
DNA replication. Leflunomide/teriflunomide might therefore be clinically useful
for preventing EBV-induced LPD in patients who have high EBV loads yet require
continued immunosuppression.

INTRODUCTION

for their proliferation [17], and the major “on target”
immunosuppressive effect of leflunomide/teriflunomide is
thought to be due to decreased T cell proliferation. In addition
to decreasing the amount of pyrimidine-based nucleotides
available for DNA/RNA synthesis, drugs that inhibit
DHODH activity globally decrease the level of O-linked
GlcNAcylate-modified proteins through an “on-target” effect
[18]. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines and
primary DLBCL tumor cells have higher levels of nuclear
O-GlcNAcylate-modified proteins than do normal B-cells,
and the levels of these proteins correlate with DLBCL cell
growth and survival [19].
Higher doses of leflunomide (still easily achieved in
patients) have been proposed to have numerous additional
“off-target” effects in vitro [12, 20–23]. Inhibition of HCMV
lytic replication by leflunomide is likely mediated through
an “off target” effect, since it is not reversed by uridine
supplementation, although the exact mechanism(s) by
which the drug acts on HCMV replication are not clear [22,
24, 25]. Higher dose leflunomide has also been shown to
inhibit the proliferation and survival of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) cells in vitro through “off-target” effects on
signaling pathways such as NF-kappa B and STAT3 [23].
However, whether leflunomide or teriflunomide can
be used to inhibit lytic viral replication in EBV-infected
B cells (similar to its effect on HCMV), or to prevent
proliferation and/or survival of latently infected B cells
(similar to its effect on CLL cells), is not known.Here we
have investigated whether therapeutically relevant levels of
teriflunomide inhibit the lytic form of EBV replication and/
or block proliferation of latently-infected B cells in vitro. In
addition, we have used two different mouse models to ask if
these drugs inhibit the growth of EBV-induced lymphomas
in vivo at non-toxic doses. We show that teriflunomide not
only blocks the lytic form of EBV infection (and hence
could be used to prevent transmission of the virus from cell
to cell), but also greatly decreases the growth of latently
infected, EBV-induced lymphomas in vivo. These results
suggest that leflunomide/teriflunomide may be useful for
preventing (and potentially treating) EBV-induced LPD in
immunosuppressed patients with high EBV loads.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus
that infects the majority of the world’s population
and causes infectious mononucleosis [1]. Like all
herpesviruses, EBV infects cells in both latent and lytic
forms. EBV-infected humans sustain life-long latent
viral infection within the memory B cell compartment,
and periodically shed infectious viral particles into the
saliva [2]. Once recovered from their initial infection,
immunocompetent hosts only rarely develop symptomatic
illness related to EBV. Nevertheless, EBV efficiently
transforms primary B cells in vitro, and is associated
with a variety of different types of B-cell lymphomas and
EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) in
humans, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [3].
Latent EBV infection is sufficient to transform
B cells in vitro in the absence of any lytic viral gene
expression [4], and the major EBV transforming proteins
(EBNA2 and LMP1) are expressed during latent
infection [3]. Nevertheless, both uncontrolled latent and
lytic infection likely contribute to the development of
EBV-LPD in immunosuppressed patients. Patients who
require pharmacologic immunosuppression, such as bone
marrow and solid organ transplant patients, have a high
risk of developing EBV-LPD, particularly when they
have high EBV loads in the blood [5]. High EBV loads
in immunosuppressed patients are usually caused by a
greatly increased number of latently-infected B cells; in
some cases an increased number of lytically-infected cells
also contribute to high viral load [6]. Drugs that can either
prevent the proliferation of latently-infected B cells, and/
or the production of infectious EBV particles, may help to
prevent the development of EBV-LPD in immunosuppressed
patients with high EBV loads. Valacyclovir, which inhibits
viral replication when metabolized to acyclovir, has been
shown to reduce the number of EBV-infected cells in
healthy volunteers [7]. However, it remains controversial
whether drugs that specifically inhibit lytic (but not latent)
EBV infection effectively prevent and/or treat EBV-LPD in
immunosuppressed patients [8–11].
Leflunomide, an immunosuppressive drug approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis since 1998, is
increasingly also used to treat human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) and BK virus infection in transplant patients
[12–14]. Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide,
is approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis [15]. The “on
target” effect of leflunomide and teriflunomide, which occurs
at low doses, is mediated through inhibition of the cellular
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme [16].
DHODH is required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis (but not
for pyrimidine synthesis mediated by the salvage pathway),
and “on target” effects of the leflunomide/teriflunomideare
reversed in vitro by supplementing the media with uridine,
which restores de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Lymphocytes
are particularly dependent upon de novo pyrimidine synthesis

RESULTS
Teriflunomide inhibits proliferation of EBVtransformed B cells in vitro
Leflunomide/teriflunomide inhibit the proliferation
of T lymphocytes and can interfere with the replication of
some viruses. We therefore examined whether the active
leflunomide metabolite, teriflunomide (A771726), affects
proliferation of EBV-transformed human B cells in vitro.
As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, teriflunomide prevented
proliferation of the EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell
line (LCL), D4, in vitro; similar results were obtained
with a second independently derived lymphoblastoid

cell line, M81-Luc (data not shown). The addition of
uridine to the media in cells treated with a very low dose
of teriflunomide (10 μg/ml, which is well below the target
plasma concentration of 40–80 μg/ml for treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis patients) partially reversed this antiproliferative effect (Figure 1B). At higher doses of drug
(40  and 70  μg/ml) the anti-proliferative effect was not
reversed by uridine. These results indicate that teriflunomide
prevents proliferation of EBV-transformed human B cells
through both “on target” and “off target” mechanisms.
Importantly, since patients can tolerate a teriflunomide
level as high as 100 μg/ml [26], high-dose leflunomide/
teriflunomide could potentially be used to inhibit the
proliferation of latently EBV-infected B cells in humans,
thereby taking advantage of both the “on-target” and “offtarget” effects of the drug.

significantly higher in teriflunomide-treated versus
untreated cells, and this effect was reversed by uridine
treatment (Figure 2B). Interestingly, although low level
LMP1 expression is required for proliferation and survival
of EBV-transformed LCLs, higher level LMP1 expression
(as little as twice that of normal level expression) inhibits
B cell proliferation [29]. Taken together, these results
suggest that excessive production of LMP1 may contribute
to the anti-proliferative effect of teriflunomide in EBVtransformed LCLs.

Teriflunomide induces p53 expression and
apoptosis in LCLs in vitro
We next determined whether teriflunomide’s effect
on LCL growth is associated with increased apoptosis.
The tumor suppressor protein, p53, plays a critical role
in promoting both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and
teriflunomide has been shown to increase p53 levels
by blocking pyrimidine biosynthesis [30]. As shown in
Figure 3A, teriflunomide treatment of LCLs increased p53
expression. Furthermore, teriflunomide treatment increased
the level of cleaved PARP (a marker for apoptosis) [31],
and the amount of activated caspases 3 and 7 (Figure 3B),
and these effects were reversed by uridine supplementation.
Thus, teriflunomide induces apoptosis of EBV-transformed
B cells through its on-target mechanism, and this effect is
likely at least partially mediated by increased p53 expression.

Teriflunomide alters EBV latency protein
expression in EBV-transformed B cells in vitro
To explore potential mechanisms(s) by which
teriflunomide halts proliferation of EBV-transformed
LCLs, we examined whether the drug alters expression
of EBV latency proteins known to be required for LCL
survival and proliferation in vitro. As shown in Figure 2A,
teriflunomide treatment increased expression of two
different EBV transforming proteins, EBNA2 (which
mimics the effects of Notch signaling) [27] and LMP1
(which mimics the effects of CD40 signaling) [28],
while not significantly affecting the expression of two
other essential EBV transforming proteins (EBNA3A
and EBNA3C). Furthermore, the ability of teriflunomide
to increase EBNA2 and LMP1 expression was observed
using a low dose (20 μg/ml) of drug and was reversed
by uridine treatment, suggesting that it is due to an “on
target” effect. The level of LMP1 transcript was also

Teriflunomide does not inhibit canonical or noncanonical NF-kB signaling in EBV-transformed
LCLs, and has little effect on c-Myc and cyclin E
expression
Teriflunomide has been reported to induce killing
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells in vitro

through off-target effects including suppression of the
canonical NF-kB cell survival pathway [23]. Since EBVtransformed LCLs require LMP1-induced NF-kB for
their survival [28], we examined whether teriflunomide
inhibits the canonical or non-canonical NF-kB pathways

in LCLs. As shown in Figure 3C, teriflunomide treatment
did not reduce the level of phosphorylated p65 (a marker
of canonical NF-kB signaling), or the amount of p52
produced by cleavage of p100 (a marker of the noncanonical NF-kB pathway; reviewed in [32]). Indeed,

duplicate.

the levels of these factors increased somewhat, likely
reflecting the ability of increased LMP1 to induce both
types of NF-kB pathways [28].
In addition, since EBNA2-induced c-Myc expression
is required for LCL proliferation [33], we examined
whether teriflunomide treatment reduces expression of
either c-Myc, or its target gene, cyclin E [34], in LCLs.
As shown in Figure 3C, there was no significant change
in c-Myc or cyclin E levels in teriflunomide-treated cells.
These results suggest that teriflunomide does not globally
inhibit NF-kB survival pathways, or c-Myc-mediated
transcription, in EBV-transformed B cells.

immediate-early lytic protein, BZLF1, and the early lytic
protein, BMRF1, in LCLs (Figure 4A). In spite of this
activation of early lytic EBV proteins, the late viral capsid
antigen, p18, was not expressed in teriflunomide-treated
LCLs (Figure 4B). This result suggests that fully lytic
EBV infection (required to transmit the virus from cell to
cell) may be blocked by teriflunomide treatment.
We next examined the effect of teriflunomide
treatment on lytic EBV protein expression and viral
DNA replication in TGF beta-treated Burkitt lymphoma
cells (Figure 4C). As previously described [36], TGF
beta treatment of EBV-infected Burkitt cells activated
expression of the EBV BZLF1 and BMRF1 immediateearly/early lytic proteins, as well as the EBV late lytic
protein, p18. While low dose (20 μg/ml) teriflunomide
treatment did not prevent TGF beta-mediated activation
of early lytic EBV proteins, it blocked induction of the late
EBV protein, p18 (Figure 4C), and this effect was largely
reversed by uridine supplementation.
Since late EBV gene expression (but not early lytic
gene expression) requires the lytic form of EBV DNA
replication [37], we next asked whether teriflunomide
decreases the amount of intracellular EBV DNA

Teriflunomide inhibits lytic EBV replication in
B cells
Given the ability of leflunomide to inhibit lytic
HCMV replication [22, 24], we determined whether
teriflunomide alters the amount of lytic EBV replication
in EBV-infected B cell lines. Consistent with its ability to
increase p53 expression, which has previously been shown
to promote enhanced early lytic EBV protein expression
[35, 36], teriflunomide increased levels of both the EBV

Figure 4: Teriflunomide inhibits lytic EBV replication in B cells. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect the immediate

early lytic protein BZLF1, the early lytic protein BMRF1, or the late lytic protein p18 in control or teriflunomide-treated cells, with or
without uridine supplementation. β-actin or GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A, B) D4 LCLs were treated with teriflunomide or with
DMSO control, each given alone or with 150 μM uridine, for 7 days. The same extracts were used in panels A and B. Control HONE-Akata
cells were treated for 3 days with 20 ng/ml TPA and 3 mM sodium butyrate, which are known to induce the late lytic EBV protein p18
in these cells. (C) Mutu I Burkitt cells were treated with teriflunomide or with DMSO control, given alone or with 150 uM uridine, for 3
days. TGFβ was given as indicated on day 0 to induce lytic activation. (D) DNA was extracted from untreated or TGFβ-treated Mutu I cells
(treated with or without teriflunomide as indicated), and quantitative PCR was used to determine the amount of EBV DNA, normalized to
the amount of β-globin DNA.

replication in TGFβ-treated Mutu I cells. As shown in
Figure 4D, TGFβ treatment increased the amount of EBV
DNA in Mutu I cells, and teriflunomide (even at the low
dose, 20 μg/ml) prevented this. Together, these results
reveal that teriflunomide inhibits the lytic form of EBV
DNA replication in B cells at doses easily achieved in
humans, and that this effect is at least partially mediated
by its effect on de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

Low-dose teriflunomide also dramatically blocked BZLF1
and BMRF1 lytic protein expression in EBV-infected
Burkitt cells treated with the combination of a phorbol
ester (TPA) and an HDAC inhibitor (sodium butyrate;
Figure 5C). Since the BMRF1 protein acts as the EBV
DNA polymerase processivity factor, and is required for
the lytic form of EBV DNA replication [38–40], no lytic
EBV replication can occur in the absence of BMRF1
expression. Interestingly, teriflunomide blockade of
early lytic EBV protein expression in response to TPA/
sodium butyrate treatment and BCR stimulation was not
reversed by uridine supplementation (Figure 5C and data
not shown), although it occurred at low doses of the drug.
Together, these results indicate the low dose teriflunamide
inhibits the ability of EBV to lytically replicate its genome
by multiple different mechanisms, some of which involve
on-target effects, and others which are mediated through
off-target effects.

Teriflunomide inhibits the earliest step of lytic
EBV reactivation in response to B-cell receptor
ligation, or phorbol ester treatment
In the course of the TGFβ treatment studies, we
discovered that teriflunomide prevents the ability of
some lytic-inducing stimuli to activate a much earlier
stage of lytic EBV reactivation (i.e., immediate-early
BZLF1 protein expression). In particular, teriflunomide
reduced immediate-early lytic protein BZLF1 and early
lytic protein BMRF1 expression in response to B-cell
receptor (BCR) ligation in both an EBV-transformed
LCL line (Figure 5A) and an EBV-infected Burkitt line
(Figure 5B). BCR stimulation by antigen is thought to
be a biologically relevant mechanism by which the virus
undergoes lytic reactivation in humans (reviewed in [35]).

Teriflunomide inhibits the growth of EBVtransformed LCLs in a xenograft mouse model
Given the ability of teriflunomide to inhibit
proliferation of LCLs in vitro, we next asked whether
teriflunomide treatment in vivo inhibits the growth

Figure 5: Teriflunomide inhibits the earliest step of lytic EBV reactivation in response to B-cell receptor ligation or

lytic induction of control or teriflunomide-treated cells, with or without uridine supplementation. β-actin was used as a loading control. (A)

of M81-Luc LCLs in a xenograft mouse model. For
these experiments, we used an LCL transformed with
an EBV virus (M81 strain) that contains a luciferase
gene inserted into the viral genome under the control
of the constitutively active HCMV IE gene promoter,
such that optical scans could be used to measure tumor
sizes at different time points. NSG mice were injected
subcutaneously in each flank with 5 million M81-Luc
LCL cells (mixed with matrigel), and then treated with
teriflunomide (20 mg/ kg ip, three times a week), starting
at day 8 after injection of the cells. The experiment was
ended when untreated tumors reached the maximum
allowable size for xenografts.
The amount of luciferase activity at each cell
injection site was measured at several time points. As
shown in Figure 6A and 6B, teriflunomide treatment
dramatically reduced luciferase activity (a measurement
of tumor size) relative to saline-treated animals, and did
not cause any obvious toxicity in animals.

B cell lymphomas in this system, even though most
animals eventually die from such lymphomas [42]. If
the ability of leflunomide/teriflunomide to prevent T cell
proliferation is greater than its effect on EBV-induced
lymphoma formation, then leflunomide could potentially
promote lymphomas in this model via its on-target
immunosuppressive effects on T cells.
In two independent experiments, mice treated with
teriflunomide failed to develop lymphomas (Figure 7A).
In the first experiment, teriflunomide treatment (20 mg/ kg
ip, three times a week, starting at day 4 after injection
of EBV-infected cord blood cells) prevented the
development of EBV-induced lesions of any kind in
the cord-blood humanized mouse model. Histological
and immunohistochemical analysis of the lesions that
developed in teriflunomide-treated animals in the
second experiment revealed only non-invasive lymphoid
aggregates (Figure 7B). The top panels of Figure 7B
show a typical large lymphoma (invading the pancreas)
from an untreated control animal; the bottom panels
show the most advanced lesion we detected (an EBVinfected non-invasive lymphoid aggregate) among the
teriflunomide-treated animals. As is typical of the EBVinduced large lymphomas that have overwhelmed the T
cell immune response in this humanized mouse model, the
untreated tumor was highly invasive and consisted almost
exclusively of B cells (which express the CD20 antigen),
and a small minority of T cells (which express the CD3
antigen; Figure 7C). Significantly, teriflunomide did not
prevent T cells from interacting with the small cluster of
EBV-infected B cells (Figure 7C). The B cells in both the
teriflunomide-treated and untreated lesions were largely
infected with EBV, as revealed by the presence of EBVencoded small RNAs (EBERs) and expression of EBNA2
(Figure 7D). Furthermore, the dose of teriflunomide used
(which resulted in a blood level of 40 μg/ml) did not

To further explore the potential utility of
leflunomide/teriflunomide treatment for preventing
EBV-induced

in
immunocompromised patients, we examined its effect
in a recently developed cord-blood humanized mouse
model. In this model, CD34-depeleted cord blood cells
are infected with EBV particles for 1 hour in vitro, and
then cord blood cells are injected intraperitoneally into
NSG mice. As previously described by our group [41],
both EBV-infected B cells and human T cells engraft
into the spleen and lymph nodes in this model. Human
T cells initially act to inhibit the growth of EBV-induced

per week starting on day 8, and euthanized on day 21. (A) On days 8, 15, and 21, mice were given 150 mg/kg luciferin intraperitoneally and

prevent engraftment of human T cells into the spleen of
mice in this model (Figure 7E). These results indicate that
teriflunomide treatment prevents EBV-infected B  cells
from forming invasive lymphomas in a humanized mouse
model, where functional T cells have been shown to be
required for control of EBV-induced lymphomas in the
absence of teriflunomide treatment [42]. Thus, the T cell
immunosuppressive effect of teriflunomide is counteracted by its growth inhibitory effect on EBV-infected
B cells in this model.

Somewhat unexpectedly, we also discovered that
teriflunomide greatly increases the amount of LMP1
expression in LCLs treated for one week. Importantly,
although low level LMP1 expression is essential for
proliferation and survival of established LCLs, higher
level LMP1 expression, as found in teriflunomide treated
LCLs, halts cell growth [45]. In addition, LMP1 overexpression in vivo may have an even more detrimental
effect on LPD growth, as LMP1 increases T-cell mediated
killing of EBV-infected B cells by enhancing MHC
class I expression [46]. LMP1 expression is intricately
regulated by the virus in LCLs through multiple different
mechanisms. We found that teriflunomide increases both
LMP1 RNA and protein levels. EBNA2, which we found
at higher levels in teriflunomide-treated cells, as well as
NFkB, which we also found to be elevated, are among
the viral and cellular transcription factors that activate
LMP1 transcription [47–49]. LMP1 is also regulated posttranscriptionally at the level of translation and autophagymediated degradation to ensure that levels of LMP1 are
adequate to promote survival but not so high as to stop
cell growth [29, 50, 51]. Although the exact mechanisms
by which teriflunomide regulates LMP1 expression
are not yet unraveled, the observed increase in LMP1
reflects an on-target effect (since it is reversible by uridine
supplementation) and occurs at low doses of drug.
At higher doses in vitro (still clinically achievable
in patients), we found that teriflunomide treatment
produces an even more profound decrease in proliferation
of EBV-transformed B cells, which is no longer reversed
by uridine treatment. Thus these drugs also inhibit the
proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells through “offtarget” mechanisms. Although the precise mechanism(s)
for these off-target effects on EBV-transformed B cells
remain to be determined, they likely reflect the previously
described ability of higher dose leflunomide/teriflunomide
treatment to inhibit multiple different cellular tyrosine
kinases, as well as AKT, S6 Kinase, NF-KB and STAT3
signaling [16, 23, 52]. Interestingly, however, we found
increased, rather than decreased, NF-kappa B signaling
in teriflunomide treated LCLs, presumably due to the
increased expression of LMP1.
In addition, we show here for the first time that
teriflunomide treatment blocks lytic EBV DNA replication
in response to a variety of different lytic-inducing stimuli.
While leflunomide has been previously reported to inhibit
HCMV replication in vitro, the mechanism(s) by which it
does so are not clear, and apparently occur downstream of
intracellular viral DNA replication [22, 24]. Leflunomide/
teriflunomide treatment also inhibits BK virus replication
in newly infected cells; in this case, the drugs inhibit
expression of the viral T antigen protein, which is required
for viral replication [53]. A recent high-throughput screen
for inhibitors of influenza virus replication identified a de
novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, A3, with effects on
replication that were reversible by uridine [54]. A3 also

DISCUSSION
Iatrogenic immunosuppression of transplant
patients confers a greatly increased risk for EBV-induced
LPD, which can be fatal. Development of LPD generally
correlates with the overall degree of immunosuppression
[43]. While reduction of immunosuppression can reverse
EBV-induced LPD in many cases, it is not always feasible
to reverse immunosuppression in patients who are also at
high risk for organ rejection. Here we have investigated
whether the immunosuppressive drug teriflunomide, a
metabolite of leflunomide, prevents proliferation of EBVtransformed B cells in vitro and inhibits EBV-induced
LPD in two different mouse models in vivo. We find
that teriflunomide is surprisingly effective for inhibiting
the growth of EBV-transformed B cells in vitro and
treating EBV-induced lymphomas in vivo. In addition,
we demonstrate that this drug prevents lytic EBV DNA
replication in B cells both by blocking the ability of
certain lytic inducing agents to activate expression of
early lytic viral proteins, and by inhibiting lytic viral
DNA replication. These results suggest that leflunomide/
teriflunomide treatment of transplant recipients that
have high EBV loads might reduce their risk of
developing EBV-LPD. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that an immunosuppressive drug in clinical
use can suppress EBV-LPD in vivo [43].
The inhibitory effect of teriflunomide on the
proliferation and survival of EBV-infected LCLs in vitro
appears to be multifactorial. At low doses, the effect is
partially reversible by uridine supplementation and thus
likely is due to the loss of activity of the major target
of these drugs (cellular DHODH), and the resultant
decrease in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Previous
studies have shown that rapid proliferation of activated
lymphocytes in response to antigen stimulation requires
de novo pyrimidine synthesis [17], and EBV-infected B
cells hijack many of the same signaling pathways used
by antigen-stimulated germinal center B cells to ensure
their proliferation and survival [44]. In addition, consistent
with a previous report showing that teriflunomide induces
p53 activation [30], we found that low dose teriflunomide
treatment of EBV-transformed LCLs increases p53
expression and apoptosis through an “on-target”
mechanism.

inhibited the replication of a number of other RNA and
DNA viruses [54]. These results suggest that leflunomide/
teriflunomide might have broad anti-viral activity by
inhibiting viral replication through its effects on de novo
pyrimidine synthesis.

Interestingly, in the case of EBV, we found that
teriflunomide can inhibit lytic EBV DNA replication
through more than one mechanism, and through on-target
and off-target effects. Teriflunomide blocks the ability
of B-cell receptor stimulation, as well as TPA/sodium

Figure 7: Teriflunomide prevents the development of EBV-induced lymphomas in a cord blood-humanized mouse
model. In two independent experiments, NSG mice were injected with human cord blood infected with 2000 infectious units of the

M81 EBV strain. Teriflunomide-treated animals received 20 mg/kg teriflunomide 3 times per week, starting on day 4. (A) Animals were
euthanized after 28 days (first experiment; N = 4, each group) or 35 days (second experiment; N = 7, each group). Visible lesions were
collected and analyzed histochemically. Lymphoma incidences for the two experiments were averaged. The significance of the difference
in incidence between treated and untreated animals was calculated for each experiment; p values were then combined. (B–E) Histological

butyrate treatment, to induce even the very earliest step of
lytic EBV reactivation (expression of the viral immediateearly lytic protein, BZLF1). While this effect occurs at low
doses, it is apparently due to an “off-target” effect since it
cannot be reversed by uridine.
In contrast, teriflunomide treatment does not
prevent the ability of TGFβ to activate expression of the
EBV immediate-early lytic protein, BZLF1, or the early
lytic EBV protein, BMRF1, but prevents its ability to
activate expression of a late structural protein (viral capsid
antigen p18). Furthermore, consistent with the known
inability of herpesvirus genes of the “late” class to be
transcribed in the absence of lytic viral DNA replication
[37], we found that the ability of TGF beta treatment to
induce intracellular EBV DNA replication is prevented
by teriflunomide. This latter effect appears to be at least
partially due to an on-target effect of the drug, since late
viral protein expression is partially rescued by uridine.
Perhaps the most striking finding in this study
is our demonstration that clinically relevant doses of
teriflunomide are quite effective for inhibiting the growth
of EBV-transformed B cells in two different mouse models
for EBV-LPD. In a cord-blood humanized mouse model
where EBV-infected B cells and human T cells are coengrafted, teriflunomide treatment (starting 4 days after
injection of cells) did not prevent the engraftment of
EBV-infected B cells or human T cells, but did block the
ability of the EBV-infected B cells to form large invasive
lymphomas. This result is particularly notable, since we
have previously shown that human T cells inhibit the
growth of the EBV-infected B cells in this model. Thus,
the ability of teriflunomide to promote EBV-induced
lymphomas via its T cell immunosuppressive effect is
clearly outweighed by its ability to inhibit the proliferation
and/or survival of EBV-infected B cells.
In addition, in a xenograft model for EBV-LPD,
even when teriflunomide therapy was delayed until
8 days after LCL injection into mice (at which point small
tumors were already palpable, and could also be visualized
by luciferin scanning; Figure 6), the drug still greatly
inhibited the growth of the LCL-induced lymphomas. In
this xenograft model, only the ability of teriflunomide to
inhibit proliferation of latently-infected EBV-positive B
cells contributes to its anti-tumor effect, since EBV cannot
infect mouse cells, and all injected LCLs at the start of the
experiment were already EBV-infected.
In summary, our investigations here, using both in
vitro as well as in vivo systems to model the effects of
the FDA-approved leflunomide metabolite teriflunomide
on latent and lytic EBV B-cell infection, suggest that
these drugs may be surprisingly effective for treating
both latent and lytic EBV infection in humans. The most
obvious potential clinical use of leflunomide/teriflunomide
for control of EBV infection in humans would be in the
transplant recipient population, since such patients require
immunosuppression in any event, and are at high risk for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

developing EBV-driven LPD. Nevertheless, these drugs
might also be useful in rare cases of fulminant infectious
mononucleosis, in which the clinical symptoms are due
not only to uncontrolled proliferation of virally-infected
B cells, but excessive T cell activation in response to
the EBV-infected B cells. In such cases, short term
leflunomide/teriflunomide therapy might not only reduce
clinical symptoms by inhibiting T cell proliferation, but
could also prevent the expansion of EBV-infected B cells.
A strength of our work is its demonstration that
teriflunomide inhibits spontaneous lymphomagenesis in
a human cord blood model of LPD. Limitations of our
studies include the examination of only one cell line
in xenografts, and the relatively short duration of the
teriflunomide treatment in both mouse models. Longterm studies of the effect of leflunomide treatment on
LCL growth in our animal models would help determine
whether lymphomas become resistant to treatment. Finally,
clinical trials will be required to determine if leflunomide/
teriflunomide treatment is safe and effective, alone or in
combination with other immunosuppressive drugs, before
recommending such therapy for selected EBV-associated
diseases in humans.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
Mutu I (a gift from Alan Rickinson) and Kem I
(a gift from Jeffrey Sample) are EBV-positive Burkitt
lymphoma cell lines and were cultured in RPMI (GIBCO)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. D4 LCL is an EBV-transformed (B95.8)
B cell lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) derived from
the peripheral blood leukocytes of anonymous donors,
obtained from the American Red Cross [55]. M81-Luc
LCLs were obtained by infecting CD34-depleted human
cord blood (AllCells) with M81-Luc virus, described
below, and selecting immortalized cells. HONE-Akata (a
gift from Lawrence Young, University of Birmingham)
is an EBV-superinfected (Akata strain) epithelial cell
carcinoma cell line. These cells were grown in DMEM
(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO).

Construction of an M81 recombinant virus that
constitutively expresses the luciferase gene
We constructed a recombinant M81 strain with
constitutive luciferase activity (B1129) by introducing a
luciferase gene (pGL4.5, Promega) into the M81 BAC
[56] via homologous recombination [57] at the SmaI
restriction site of the BXLF1 coding region (coordinate
131,127 on the M81 genome, GenBank accession number
KF373730.1). The expression of the luciferase gene on
this virus is driven by a CMV early enhancer/chicken beta

actin (CAG) promoter. The disruption of BXLF1 gene has
previously been confirmed not to interfere with the growth
of LCLs [58]. Infectious virions were harvested from 293
cells (ATCC) stably infected with M81-Luc virus.

Cell lysates were harvested in Sumo lysis buffer
including protease inhibitors (Roche) as described
previously [59], except cells were washed only once
with PBS (DPBS, GIBCO) prior to resuspension. Protein
concentration was determined using the Sumo protein
assay (Biorad), and proteins were separated in SDS10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto a
nitro-cellulose membrane (0.22 μm, used only for p18,
Maine manufacturing; or 0.45 μm, GVS North America).
Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Roundy’s), and 0.1% Tween 20 (SigmaAldrich). Membranes were then incubated in PBS/5%
Bovine Serum Albumin (Research Products International;
for Exalpha antibodies), PBS/5%BSA/0.1%Tween
20 (Cell Signaling antibodies) or PBS/5% milk/0.1%
Tween 20 (all other antibodies). The following primary
anti-human antibodies were used: anti-EBNA2 (mouse,
#90543, clone PE2, Abcam, 1:500); anti-LMP1 (mouse,
#78113, clones CS1-4, Abcam, 1:500); anti-EBNA3A
(sheep polyclonal, Abcam, 1:2000); anti-EBNA3c (sheep
polyclonal, Exalpha Pharmaceuticals, 1:2000); anti-βactin (mouse, A5441, clone AC-15, Sigma, 1:5,000); antiNFkB2p100/p52 (rabbit, #3017, Cell Signaling, 1:1000);
anti-phosphoNFkBp65 (ser536, rabbit, #3303, clone 93H1,
Cell Signaling 1:1000); anti-cMYC (rabbit, #32072, clone
Y69, Abcam, 1:10,000); anti-Cyclin E (mouse, #sc-247,
clone HE12, Santa Cruz, 1:250); anti-PARP (rabbit, #9542,
Cell Signaling, 1:1000); anti-p53 (mouse, clone DO-1,
Santa Cruz, 1:1000); anti-BZLF1 (mouse, sc-53904, BZ1,
Santa Cruz, 1:500); anti-BMRF1 (mouse, MAB8186,
clone R3, Millipore, 1:3,000); anti- EBV p18 protein (goat
polyclonal; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:2000); and antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (A00192;
Genscript; 1:4,000). The secondary antibodies used were
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse
antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:5,000), goat antirabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher scientific, 1:5,000); rabbit
anti-sheep antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:5000); and donkey
anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:5000). Blots were
developed with the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In vitro drug treatment studies
Growth assays
D4 LCLs were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml on day 0
and harvested on day 7. One hour after plating, cells were
treated with dimethyl sulfoxide control (DMSO; SigmaAldrich); or with 2.5 to 70 μg/ml teriflunomide (A771726;
CalBiochem in Figure 1A; ENZO Life Sciences in
all others) dissolved in DMSO. The final DMSO
concentration in control and treatment groups was 0.1%.
Uridine-treated cells were given 150 μM uridine one hour
prior to teriflunomide or DMSO treatment. Growing cells
were expanded into fresh medium containing DMSO or
teriflunomide, with or without 150 μM uridine (SigmaAldrich), as needed. Cells treated with teriflunomide in
Figure 1A were given fresh drug every 24 hours. Cells
were counted using trypan blue exclusion (Figure 1A) or
relative cell titers were determined using Cell Titer Glo
as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega; Figure 1B).
Drug response studies
D4 LCLs were treated for 7 days with 6.5 to 70 μg/
ml of teriflunomide, added one hour after cells were plated
with or without uridine at 3 × 105 cells/ml. Growing D4
LCLs were expanded into fresh medium supplemented
with drugs as needed. All D4 LCLs were given fresh
teriflunomide on day 3, day 5 (Figure 3C only), and day
6.5. M81-Luc LCLs, Mutu I, and Kem I cells at 2–5 × 105
cells/ml were treated for 3 days with 6.5 to 50 μg/ml
teriflunomide, 150 μM uridine, or 0.1% DMSO control,
on day 0 only, and were not expanded. The following
reagents were added one hour after teriflunomide
treatment to induce lytic EBV reactivation: phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA; 20 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich),
sodium butyrate (3 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-human IgG
(10 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-human IgM (6.8 μg/ml;
Southern Biotech), or TGFβ (5 ng/ml; R&D Systems).
HONE-Akata cells were treated with TPA and sodium
butyrate as above on day 0 and were collected on day 3.

Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) analysis

Cell death assay
Cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/ml on day 0 and
treated with teriflunomide or control DMSO. DMSOtreated wells required expansion on day 2. All cells
received fresh drug/DMSO and medium on day 3. On
day 5, cells were collected, washed twice with PBS,
resuspended in fresh medium without drugs or DMSO,
and plated at 3 × 105 cells/ml. Caspase 3/7 activity was
measured on day 6 using 25 μl sample and 25 μl Caspase
Glo 3/7 (Promega).

Total RNA was extracted using the RNA-Bee reagent
(Tel-Test Inc., catalog # Cs-104B) from D4 LCLs treated
with 20 μg/ml teriflunomide or DMSO control for 7 days.
The extracted RNA was then DNAse treated, followed by
reverse transcription using random primers and GoScript
Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, catalog # A5000). Realtime PCR was performed on the reverse transcribed cDNA
using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad, catalog

as a housekeeping gene, and transcripts were quantified
using the delta-delta Cq methods for each time point.

on day 4, three times a week. Mice were euthanized on
day 35 (Experiment 1) or 28 (Experiment 2). Tumor size
was quantitated by dissecting and weighing grossly visible
tumor tissue.

Tissue Analysis
Following euthanasia of EBV-infected humanized
mice, multiple different organs (including the lungs,
spleen, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, and mesenteric fat)
were formalin fixed. Paraffin-embedded sections were
then analyzed using a variety of techniques to determine if
animals had persistent EBV infection and/or EBV-positive
lymphomas, and to assess the viral protein expression
pattern. Sections were stained with hematoxylin (Shandon
Instant Hematoxylin, Shandon Lipshaw) and eosin (Eosin
Y, Sigma-Aldrich), hybridized in situ with probes for EBV
EBER RNAs (PNA ISH Detection Kit; DakoCytomation),
or analyzed immunohistochemically using the following
anti-human antibodies: anti-CD20 (mouse, clone H1(FB1),
BD Pharmingen), anti-CD3 (mouse, clone F7.2.3; Dako),
and anti-EBNA2 (mouse, Abcam) as previously described
[62]. Images were taken with 2× and 10× objectives (20×
and 100× magnification, respectively) using an Olympus
BX53 microscope.

Viral DNA replication quantitative PCR assay
Intracellular DNA from 106 treated Mutu I cells
(treatments as indicated in the Figure legend) was
harvested, purified, and quantified as described [60].

Mouse studies
All animal experiments were approved by the
University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted in
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals [61]. Immunodeficient NSG (NOD/
LtSz-scid/IL2Rgnull) mice were bred at UW-Madison from
stocks purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

Statistics

Xenograft studies

Mstat Software (http://mcardle.wisc.edu/mstat/
download/index.html) was used to statistically analyze the
data. For tumor formation comparison, the p value was
calculated using a two-tailed Fisher exact test.

NSG mice were injected subcutaneously in
the flanks with 5 × 106 M81-Luciferase (M81-Luc)
lymphoblastoid cells. Mice were treated with 20 mg/
kg teriflunomide intraperitoneally three times a week,
beginning on day 8 and sacrificed on day 21 post-infection
(a total of six injections). To determine tumor size,
mice were injected intraperitoneally with the luciferase
substrate luciferin (150 mg/kg; Gold Biotechnology) and
scanned using an IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging system.
The light produced by the luciferase was quantified using
Living Image software (PerkinElmer).

Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’ institutional
review board (UW SMPH ACUC protocol #5197).
