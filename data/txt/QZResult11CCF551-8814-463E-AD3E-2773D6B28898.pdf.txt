Abstract

TP53 , a well-known tumour suppressor gene, is frequently inactivated by mutation or deletion in
a majority of human tumours1,2. A tremendous effort has been made to restore p53 activity in
cancer therapies3–7. However, no effective p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into

clinical cancer treatment due to the complexity of p53 signalling. Here, we demonstrate that
genomic deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses neighbouring essential genes, rendering cancer
cells with hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of such genes. POLR2A is
identified as such a gene that is almost always co-deleted with TP53 in human cancers. It encodes
the largest and catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II complex, which is specifically inhibited by
α-Amanitin8,9. Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopaedia (CCLE) databases reveals that POLR2A expression levels are tightly correlated
with its gene copy numbers in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Suppression of POLR2A with αAmanitin or small interfering RNAs, selectively inhibits proliferation, survival and tumorigenic
potential of CRC cells with hemizygous TP53 loss in a p53-independent manner. Previous clinical
applications of α-Amanitin have been limited due to its liver toxicity10. However, we found that
α-Amanitin-based antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly effective therapeutic agents with
reduced toxicity11. Here, we show that low doses of α-Amanitin-conjugated anti-EpCAM
(Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule) antibody lead to complete tumour regression in murine
models of human CRC with hemizygous deletion of POLR2A. We anticipate that inhibiting
POLR2A will be a novel therapeutic approach for human cancers harbouring such common
genomic alterations.

Genomic deletion of a tumour suppressor gene often encompasses multiple neighbouring
genes that may not contribute to cancer development, but are essential for cell proliferation
and survival12. This partial loss of essential genes has been postulated to render cancer cells
highly vulnerable to further inhibition of those genes13,14. Analysis of TCGA revealed that
hemizygous deletion of the TP53 gene occurs frequently in human cancers (Fig. 1a). We
identified POLR2A as an essential gene in the proximity of TP53 (Fig. 1b). Concomitant
deletion of POLR2A occurs in virtually all the human colorectal tumours harbouring
hemizygous deletion of TP53 (Fig. 1c).

Author Manuscript

Among the twelve subunit in human RNA polymerase II complex, POLR2A encodes the
largest subunit that is indispensable for the polymerase activity in mRNA synthesis.
Inhibiting POLR2A with a specific inhibitor, α-Amanitin, causes extensive cell death, and
homozygous deletion of POLR2A is lethal in human cells9,15. We found that 104 (53%) out
of 195 CRC cases bear hemizygous loss of the 17p13 region, resulting in concomitant
deletion of TP53 and POLR2A (Fig. 1c). However, no homozygous deletion of POLR2A
was observed, consistent with the notion that POLR2A is essential for cell survival. Analysis
of TCGA and CCLE databases revealed that expression of POLR2A is tightly correlated
with its gene copy number (Fig. 1d). This positive correlation was also validated in twenty
pairs of matched normal and CRC tissue samples and human CRC tissue microarray (Fig. 1e
and Extended Data Fig. 1). POLR2Aloss (hemizygous loss) cell lines expressed POLR2A
proteins at significantly lower levels than POLR2Aneutral cell lines (Fig. 1f–h). Unlike
POLR2A, p53 levels are determined by post-transcriptional and post-translational events16.
Despite a correlation between TP53 copy number and mRNA expression, p53 protein levels
are not associated with its gene copy numbers in human CRC (Extended Data Fig. 2 and
Fig. 1h).

To assess the sensitivity of cells to POLR2A inhibition, a panel of POLR2Aneutral (HCT116,
SW480) and POLR2Aloss (SW837, SNU283) cells were treated with α-Amanitin. Treatment
of α-Amanitin at high concentrations (≥ 1μg ml−1) caused complete cell death in all four cell
lines. However, at concentrations from 0 to 1.0 μg ml−1, α-Amanitin inhibition had
significantly higher levels of cell-killing effect on the POLR2Aloss cells than on the
POLR2Aneutral cells (Fig. 2a, b). The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) was
~1.0 μg ml−1 for the POLR2Aneutral cells, which was ~10-fold greater than that of the
POLR2Aloss cells. By contrast, the POLR2Aloss cells did not show any greater sensitivity to
the treatment of actinomycin D, a nonspecific transcription inhibitor (Extended Data Fig.
3a). In direct competition assays, the POLR2Aneutral cells (HCT116, SW480) stably
expressing POLR2A shRNAs only had modestly reduced proliferation, in comparison with
that of the corresponding cells expressing control shRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 3b, c).
However, silencing POLR2A in the POLR2Aloss cells (SNU283, SW837) led to markedly
reduced proliferation. We generated HCT116 and SNU283 cell lines stably expressing
doxycycline (Dox)-inducible POLR2A shRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Despite significant
knockdown of POLR2A, HCT116 cells continued to proliferate, whereas SNU283 cells
exhibited severe G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Fig. 2c, d and Extended Data Fig. 3e–g).
Approximately 50% of decrease in POLR2A expression (30–100 ng ml−1 of Dox)
remarkably reduced the proliferation of SNU283 cells, but only had a modest effect on
HCT116 cells (Fig. 2d). Results of rescue experiments demonstrated that gradual reexpression of exogenous POLR2A in SNU283 and SW837 cells restored their resistance to
α-Amanitin up to a level comparable to that of the POLR2Aneutral cells (Fig. 2e, f and
Extended Data Fig. 4).

To exclude genetic difference across cell lines, we employed CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9 system to generate an isogenic HCT116 cell line
with hemizygous loss of POLR2A17,18 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). POLR2A expression was
significantly reduced in the POLR2Aloss HCT116 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d). The
POLR2Aloss and parental HCT116 cells exhibited similar proliferation rates (Extended Data
Fig. 5e), indicating that one allele of POLR2A is sufficient to maintain cell proliferation.
However, hemizygous deletion of POLR2A dramatically sensitized HCT116 cells to αAmanitin treatment with an IC50 of ~ 0.1 μg ml−1, which is 8-fold lower than that of
parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 2g, h). As a control, no substantial difference on their
sensitivity to actinomycin D was observed (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Knockdown of
POLR2A resulted in profoundly reduced proliferation in the POLR2Aloss cells, but not in
the isogenic POLR2Aneutral cells (Extended Data Fig. 5g). In the isogenic pair of HCT116
cell lines expressing Dox-inducible POLR2A shRNAs, a low-dose of Dox (100 ng ml−1)
was sufficient to remarkably kill the POLR2Aloss cells, while high doses of Dox only had
minimal effects on the POLR2Aneutral cells (Fig. 2i, j and Extended Data Fig. 5h).
Blockage of RNA polymerase may lead to p53 accumulation and activation19. To examine
the effects of p53, we recapitulated the concomitant deletion of TP53 and POLR2A in
HCT116 and xhCRC cell lines (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). The xhCRC cell line
(TP53+/+;POLR2A+/+), established from a freshly isolated xenografted human colon
tumour, demonstrated enhanced tumourigenicity in vivo20. Except for slightly increased cell

proliferation, no significant changes in their sensitivity to α-Amanitin were observed in
either xhCRC or HCT116 cells with hemizygous deletion of TP53. By contrast, hemizygous
loss of POLR2A markedly sensitized these cells to α-Amanitin treatment regardless of their
TP53 status (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6d–g). The mRNA synthesis activity of the
RNA polymerase II is essential to any type of cells including therapy-resistant tumour cells.
We examined the drug sensitivity of POLR2Aneutral and POLR2Aloss cells to three major
chemotherapy drugs for CRC: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and SN-38. Inhibition of
POLR2A by α-Amanitin significantly enhanced cell-killing effects of all three drugs in the
POLR2Aloss xhCRC cells, but had no notable effects on the POLR2Aneutral cells (Fig. 3c),
suggesting therapeutic vulnerability of POLR2Aloss colorectal tumours. Free α-Amanitin is
toxic to liver due to its interaction with OATP1B3, a transporter exclusively expressed on
the membrane of hepatocytes10. However, α-Amanitin, when conjugated with specific
antibodies, is no longer a substrate for OATP1B310,11,21. This strategy overcomes the
toxicity of α-Amanitin for clinical applications. We used α-Amanitin conjugated to a
monoclonal antibody (HEA125) against EpCAM, a cancer antigen overexpressed in
adenocarcinomas11,22. The Ama-HEA125 conjugate selectively killed the POLR2Aloss
xhCRC and HCT116 cancer cells in a p53-independent manner and reduced the effective
doses of α-Amanitin by at least 10,000-fold (IC50 ~ 0.01 ng ml−1) in vitro (Fig. 3d and
Extended Data Fig. 6h).

To test the anti-tumour effect of POLR2A inhibition in vivo, HCT116 and SNU283 cells
expressing Dox-inducible POLR2A shRNA were injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID
mice. Following initial tumour establishment, administration of Dox (1.0 μg ml−1) in
drinking water suppressed POLR2A expression and consequently inhibited the growth of
SNU283-derived tumours (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). However, no substantial
differences were observed between control and POLR2A-knockdown HCT116-derived
tumours. Histopathologic analyses demonstrated that POLR2A-knockdown SNU283
tumours had significantly reduced cell proliferation, but more apoptotic cells, as compared
with the corresponding control tumours (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c). By contrast, no
significant changes were observed in the control or POLR2A-knockdown HCT116 tumours.
However, hemizygous deletion of POLR2A sensitized HCT116-derived tumours to Dox
treatment (Extended Data Figure 7d, e). Next, we employed an orthotopic tumour model by
injecting POLR2Aneutral and POLR2Aloss HCT116 cells into the cecal wall of NOD/SCID
mice. In-vivo tumour imaging demonstrated that Dox-induced POLR2A inhibition led to a
significant decrease in tumour growth kinetics in the POLR2Aloss tumours, but not in the
control POLR2Aneutral tumours (Fig. 4c–e, and Extended Data Fig. 7f). To further test the
efficacy of POLR2A silencing in vivo, we used a nanoliposomal delivery platform, DOPC
(1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine), for systemic delivery of POLR2A
siRNAs23 (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Following four weeks of systemic therapy, compared
with control siRNA-DOPC treatment, mice in the 125 μg kg−1 of POLR2A siRNA-DOPC
treatment groups had pronounced growth reduction of POLR2Aloss tumors, while
POLR2Aneutral tumors only had significant growth inhibition even at the dose of 1,000 μg
kg−1 (Extended Data Fig. 8c–h).

Next, we investigated the anti-tumour activity of Ama-HEA125 in orthotopic tumour
models established by isogenic pairs of xhCRC and HCT116 cells (TP53/POLR2Aneutral and
TP53/POLR2Aloss) (Fig. 4f–i and Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). In a dose escalation
experiment, Ama-HEA125 was administered to the tumour-bearing mice as dual
intraperitoneal injections at the dose of 3, 10, 30, or 90 μg with respect to α-Amanitin per kg
of mouse body weight. In the mice bearing POLR2Aloss tumours, control HEA125-treated
mice showed continuous tumour growth within 25 days after antibody injection. The
treatment of Ama-HEA125 showed strong inhibition on tumour growth even at the lowest
dose of 3 μg kg−1. All the POLR2Aloss tumours responded to Ama-HEA125 treatment, and
tumour volume regressed dramatically (Fig. 4f–i). Complete tumour regression was
observed in 10 of 10 (90 μg kg−1), 8 of 10 (30 μg kg−1), and 6 of 10 (10 μg kg−1) mice
bearing POLR2Aloss HCT116 tumours 25 days after the first administration of AmaHEA125 (Fig. 4f, g). By contrast, significant tumour inhibition was observed in the mice
bearing POLR2Aneutral tumours only at the highest dose of 90 μg kg−1, but not at the doses
of 3–30 μg kg−1. Similar results were observed in the mice bearing xhCRC-derived tumours
(Fig. 4h, i). Consistent with our previous study11, treatment of Ama-HEA125 at the tested
doses had no notable toxicity in vivo. Analysis of body weights and blood liver enzymes did
not reveal any substantial differences between the Ama-HEA125-treated group and control
HEA125-treated group (Extended Data Fig. 9d, e), suggesting negligible systemic toxicity
of the Ama-HEA125 conjugate. In addition, we also tested the anti-tumour activity of AmaHEA125 in orthotopic tumours derived from the POLR2Aneutral SW480 cells and the
POLR2Aloss SW837 cells (Extended Data Fig. 10). Treatment of Ama-HEA125 at the dose
of 10 μg kg−1 was sufficient to inhibit tumour growth in all the POLR2Aloss tumours, while
POLR2Aneutral (SW480) or POLR2A-restored (SW837 expressing exogenous POLR2A)
tumours were only significantly inhibited by Ama-HEA125 at the dose of 90 μg kg−1.

Much effort has been directed towards restoring p53 activity in human cancer cells3,4,7,24.
Instead of pharmacologic intervention of p53 signalling, the principle of collateral
vulnerability to POLR2A inhibition provides a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Our
preclinical studies with α-Amanitin demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of the strategy for
treating CRC. Given that hemizygous loss of TP53 is a frequent genomic event in many
human cancers, the therapeutic strategy described herein may have broad applications.
While clinical applications of α-Amanitin are limited by its liver toxicity, conjugation of αAmanitin to antibodies against tumour-specific biomarkers minimizes its systemic toxicity
and moreover, increases the efficacy of treatment. The identification of new pharmacologic
agents that target POLR2A should significantly impact personalized cancer therapies.

METHODS
Cell culture, antibodies and Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

HCT116, SW480, SW837, HT29, DLD1, and HT29 cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured under standard conditions specified by the
manufacturer. SNU283 and SNU1197 cell lines were obtained from the Korean Cell Line
Bank and cultured in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mmol L−1 LGlutamine. Isolation, culture and maintenance of xenografted human primary CRC (xhCRC)
cells were performed as previously described20. Briefly, patient-derived xenografts were
harvested under sterile conditions and mechanically dissociated, followed by 30 min of
incubation in collagenase II at 37°C. The specimen was filtered through a sterile 100-μm
strainer. Red blood cells were eliminated with a hypo-osmotic red blood cell lysis buffer
(eBioscience). Mouse cells in xenografted human CRC specimens were removed by
negative selection using a mouse MHC class I molecule H-2K antibody followed by use of a
magnetic bead purification kit (Miltenyi). Fibroblasts were removed by negative selection
using a MACS magnetic bead separation kit (Miltenyi). The freshly isolated xhCRC cells
were maintained on collagen-1-coated culture plates (BD Biosciences) and cultured in MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, vitamins (1×), nonessential amino acids (1×), Pen-Strep (1×),
sodium pyruvate (1×), and L-glutamine (1×). All medium supplements were purchased from
Sigma.

Anti-POLR2A antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (#sc-47701) and Abcam
(#ab140509). Anti-Ki67 antibody (#D3B5) and anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175, #5A1E)
antibody were obtained from Cell Signalling. Anti-p53 (#sc-126), anti-β-actin (#sc-1616),
HRP-anti-goat IgG (#sc-2020), HRP-anti-rabbit IgG (#sc-2054), and HRP-anti-mouse IgG
(#sc-2055) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Cell lysate preparation, SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting were performed as previously described25.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and then reversetranscribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting cDNA was used for
qPCR using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) with gene-specific primers
and the results were normalized to β-actin control. In RT-PCR assays, the primer sequences
for TP53 are: 5′-GAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACC-3′ and 5′TCCGTCCCAGTAGATTACCAC-3′, and for POLR2A are: 5′TTGTATCCGTACCCACAGCA-3′and 5′-CATGATCAGCTCCCCATTCT-3′.

shRNA-mediated knockdown of POLR2A
POLR2A-specific shRNA clones were obtained from the MD Anderson shRNA and
ORFeome Core Facility (originally from Open Biosystems). Twelve shRNAs targeting
POLR2A were screened, of which two shRNAs knocked down protein levels by at least
50% in all four colorectal cancer cell lines tested. Their clone identification numbers and
shRNA sequences are V3LHS_645674 (5′-TTAGCTTTGTTCTTCCCGA-3′) and
V3LHS_64029 (5′-TGTTGTCCATCTCCTCCCC-3′). The hairpin sequences in the GIPZ
vector were cloned into the TRIPZ vector (Dharmacon) using a protocol provided by the

reporter.
Generation of cells stably expressing Dox-inducible shRNAs

Author Manuscript

Recombinant lentiviral particles were produced from 293T cells. Briefly, 72 μg of shRNAencoding vector DNA, 54 μg of Delta 8.9 vector DNA and 18 μg of VSVG-encoding vector
DNA were transfected into 293T cells (plated in the 245-mm2 dish) using X-tremeGENE
(Roche). Supernatant containing virus particles was collected and filtered 72 h after
transfection, concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 90,000g, and resuspended in cell growth
medium. To generate stable Dox-inducible cells, HCT116 and SNU283 cells were infected
with shRNA-expressing viral particles at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Viral
solutions were added to cell culture medium containing 4 μg ml−1 polybrene. Cells were
selected 48 h after infection by 2 μg ml−1 puromycin. Single colonies were cultured and
propagated, and colonies bearing a single copy of lentiviral DNA insert were identified and
analysed for knockdown efficiency.
Direct competition assay using POLR2A shRNA

Author Manuscript

A single lentiviral copy expressing either shRNA-1 or shRNA-2 was sufficient to suppress
POLR2A expression levels in all the four colorectal cell lines tested (Extended Data Fig.
3b). Cancer cells were infected with control or POLR2A shRNA-expressing lentiviruses
(pGIPZ backbone expressing GFP) at the MOI of 2. Two days after infection, GFP-positive
cells were sorted using a BD FACSJazz™ cell sorter (BD Biosciences) at the MD Anderson
Flow Cytometry and Cellular Imaging Core. Next, GFP-positive cells were mixed with noninfected and GFP-negative cells at the ratio of 1:1 and cultured for six passages. The
numbers of GFP-positive and total cells at each passage were analysed and quantified by
flow cytometry and the percentages of GFP-positive cells were calculated.
Generation of sgRNA-expressing vectors and Suveryor assay

Author Manuscript

Bicistronic expression vector expressing Cas9 and sgRNA was digested with BbsI and
treated with alkaline phosphatase, and then the linearized vector was gel purified for cloning
sgRNA-encoding DNA26. The pair of oligo DNA for each sgRNA targeting TP53 or
POLR2A was annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated to the linearized vector. The sequences
of oligo DNA are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Suveryor assay was performed to test the
genome editing efficacy as previously described27,28. Briefly, cells were seeded into sixwell plates at a density of 2×105 cells per well. One day after initial seeding, cells were
transfected with 2 μg of Cas9/sgRNA-expressing vector DNA and harvested 48 h after
transfection. Genomic DNA was isolated and a 1kb DNA fragment containing the sgRNAtargeting site was amplified by high-fidelity PCR and digested by T7 endonuclease I.
Genomic DNA isolated from HCT116 cells transfected with control vector DNA was used
as control. To allow complementary but mismatched strands to anneal, PCR products were
incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C to 85 °C at the rate of −2 °C s−1 and 85 °C to 25 °C at
the rate of −0.1 °C s−1. T7 endonuclease I was added and samples were incubated at 37 °C
for 60 min to digest the annealed PCR products at the mismatch sites. T7 endonuclease Idigested PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide

sequences used for PCR amplification are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The PCR
products from positive clones were ligated to pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and further
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Cell proliferation and survival assay
Equal numbers of cells were plated in 12-well plates in triplicate. Cells were fixed with 10%
methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (dissolved in 10% methanol) at indicated
times. After staining, wells were washed three times with PBS and destained with acetic
acid. The absorbance of the crystal violet solution was measured at 590 nm. For cell survival
assay, cells were seeded at a concentration of 1,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and
treated with indicated concentrations of α-Amanitin or actinomycin D 24 hours later. Cell
viability was quantified using WST-1 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
The HCT116 and SNU283 cell lines were treated with or without α-Amanitin for 2d or
doxycycline for 4d at indicated concentrations and stained with annexin V-PE and 7-AAD
(Biovision). Apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry using a Guava EasyCyte Flow
Cytometer (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Both pre-apoptotic
(annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative) and apoptotic (annexin V-positive and 7-AADpositive) cells were included in the analyses. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 75%
ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The cells were washed with cold PBS, treated with 100 μg of
RNase A (Qiagen), and stained with 50 μg of propidium iodide (Roche). Cell cycle profiles
were analysed by flow cytometry using the Guava EasyCyte Flow Cytometer (Millipore).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
FISH analysis was performed using Fluorescein-labelled POLR2A (red) and control
centromere (Chr 17, green) probes from Empire Genomics. Hybridization and detection
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The slides were counterstained
with DAPI, and the images were captured using a Nikon E800 microscope equipped with a
cooled-charge coupled device (CCD) camera. To determine hemizygous loss of the
POLR2A gene, 100 individual nuclei were analysed for each case. The interphase nuclei
were captured and processed using the Quantitative Image Processing System (Applied
Imaging).
Patient samples

Author Manuscript

Matched normal and colorectal tumour tissue samples from patients were obtained from the
MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) through appropriate informed consents after
approval by the institutional review board (IRB# PA11-0767). To determine the expression
levels of POLR2A protein, tissue samples (20–40 mg) were placed in tubes containing
ceramic beads and were homogenized using a Precellys 24 homogenizer device (Bertin
Technologies). The lysates were spun-down twice (15 min, 16,000 g) and the supernatant
was collected.

Genomic DNA isolation and copy number validation

Author Manuscript

Total genomic DNA was extracted from human tissue specimens and cell lines using
DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s purification
instructions. All the DNA samples were stored at −20°C. The copy number variations for
POLR2A were determined using TaqMan probes (Hs02023849_cn and Hs01252684_cn) and
standard TaqMan PCR kit on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System.
And the reference gene TERT was simultaneously quantified in the same reaction for each
DNA sample.
Conjugation of α-Amanitin to anti-EpCAM antibody (HEA125)

Author Manuscript

Antibody-drug conjugate ama-HEA125 was constructed by coupling of α-Amanitin to
lysine residues of HEA125 antibody by a stable linker structure. HEA125 binds to EpCAMexpressing cells with high affinity (Kd ~ 2.2 × 10−9 mol L−1) and high specificity. HEA125
was purified by affinity chromatography using a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (GE
Healthcare). α-Amanitin was attached to immunoglobulin molecules by a plasma stable urea
linkage intended to release free α-Amanitin inside the tumour cell after lysosomal
degradation of the antibody moiety. The drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of the α-Amanitin:IgG
molecule was 4:1. Biochemical characteristics of ama-HEA125 were evaluated by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a PlatinBlue HPLC system (Knauer). In
addition, HEA125 and ama-HEA125 were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie
staining according to common procedures. Verification of drug-loading was done by antiamanitin immunoblotting analysis of 30 ng HEA125 and ama-HEA125 using standard
techniques.

siRNAs for in vivo delivery were encapsulated into DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphatidylcholine). DOPC and siRNA were mixed in the presence of excess tertiary
butanol at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) siRNA/DOPC. Tween 20 was added to the mixture in a ratio
of 1:19 Tween 20:siRNA/DOPC. The mixture was vortexed, frozen in an acetone/dry ice
bath, and lyophilized. Prior to in vivo administration, this preparation was hydrated with
PBS at room temperature at a concentration of 150–1,000 μg siRNA/kg per injection (each
mouse received 200 μL of DOPC:siRNA:PBS solution by the intraperitoneal route).
Xenograft tumour studies

Author Manuscript

Four- to six-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories
and housed under pathogen-free conditions. All studies were approved and supervised by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center. When used
in a power calculation, our sample size predetermination experiments indicated that 5 mice
per group can identify the expected effect of POLR2A on tumour size and weight (p < 0.05)
with 90% power. Animals were randomly divided to different groups. Dox-inducible
HCT116 (1 × 106) and SNU283 (2 × 106) cells in 50 μl growth medium (mixed with
Matrigel at 1:1) were injected subcutaneously into the flank using a 100-μl Hamilton
microliter syringe. Tumour size was measured every five days using a calliper, and tumour
volume was calculated using the standard formula: 0.5 × L × W2, where L is the longest

diameter and W is the shortest diameter. For orthotopic mouse model, the NOD/SCID mice
were anaesthetized and the skin was incised to expose cecum. Dox-inducible HCT116 cells
(1 × 106) expressing luciferase were injected into the cecal wall using a 100-μl Hamilton
microliter syringe, and then the incision was closed using wound clips. Tumours were
monitored by the IVIS system after luciferin injection for 15 min. After initial establishment
of tumour (100 mm3 for subcutaneous implants and 2 × 108 photons/second, total flux for
orthotopic implants), mice were treated with 1μg ml−1 doxycycline in drinking water for 3 to
4 weeks. The doxycycline water was changed every other day.

For xenograft tumour studies using DOPC-encapsulated siRNAs, isogenic pairs of HCT116
(1 × 106) cells were transplanted into the cecal wall using a 100-μl Hamilton microliter
syringe. Ten days following cell injection, mice were randomly divided and assigned to
receive either control siRNA-DOPC or POLR2A siRNA-DOPC. The siRNA sequences are
as follows: control siRNA (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ and 5′ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA-3′); POL2 siRNA-1 (5′CCAACAUGCUGACAGAUAU-3′ and 5′-AUAUCUGUCAGCAUGUUGG-3′); POL2
siRNA-2 (5′-CCAAGAAGCGGCUCACACA-3′ and 5′UGUGUGAGCCGCUUCUUGG-3′). A dose of 150 to 1,000 μg siRNA/kg mouse was
administrated intraperitoneally at twice weekly intervals. This range of concentrations was
determined by the Center for RNA Interference and Noncoding RNAs at MD Anderson
Cancer Center, which ensures efficient delivery and knockdown of target genes as
previously described23.

For xenograft tumour studies using α-Amanitin-HEA125 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),
isogenic pairs of HCT116 (1 × 106), xhCRC (0.5 × 106), SW480 (1 × 106) or SW837 (2 ×
106) cells were transplanted into the cecal wall using a 100-μl Hamilton microliter syringe.
Mice bearing 10-day-old tumors were randomized to five groups (n = 10 mice/group) and
received two intraperitoneal doses (at 10 d and 17 d, 1 week apart) of the following: 1)
control unconjugated HEA125 mAb at a dose of 3.6 mg kg−1 of body weight; 2) AmaHEA125 at a dose of 90 μg kg−1 in terms of α-Amanitin (corresponding to 3.6 mg kg−1 of
IgG); 3) Ama-HEA125, 30 μg kg−1 in terms of α-Amanitin (corresponding to 1.2 mg kg−1
of IgG); 4) Ama-HE125, 10 μg kg−1 in terms of α-Amanitin (corresponding to 0.4 mg kg−1
of IgG); and 5) Ama-HEA125, 3 μg kg−1 in terms of α-Amanitin (corresponding to 0.12 mg
kg−1 of IgG). Tumours were monitored by the IVIS live imaging system twice a week after
luciferin injection for 15 min. Body weights were recorded every four days. Blood was
obtained by retro-orbital bleeding after anaesthesia on day 21 and levels of blood liver
enzymes (AST: aspartate amino transferase, ALT: amino alanine transferase and alkaline
phosphatase) were determined at the Clinical Pathology, Veterinary Medicine and Surgery
Core of MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Mice were euthanized when they met the institutional euthanasia criteria for tumour size and
overall health condition. Tumours were removed, photographed and weighed. The freshly
dissected tumour tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight, washed with PBS,
transferred to 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin
and eosin. The investigators were blinded to the group allocation during the experiment and
when assessing the outcome.

Immunohistochemistry and human colon tissue microarray

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Colon cancer tissue microarray (BC051110a) was purchased from Biomax, including 110
colon tumour samples and 10 nomral colon tissue samples. Samples were deparaffinized and
rehydrated. Antigen was retrieved using 0.01 M sodium-citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at a subboiling temperature for 10 min after boiling in a microwave oven. To block endogenous
peroxidase activity, the sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.
After 1 h of pre-incubation in 5% normal goat serum to prevent nonspecific staining, the
samples were incubated with antibody against POLR2A (#sc-47701, Santa Cruz), Ki67,
(#D3B5, Cell Signaling), or cleaved Caspase-3 (#5A1E, Cell Signaling) at 4 °C overnight.
The sections were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (4Plus Biotinylated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, BioCARE) and then incubated with avidin–biotin peroxidase
complex solution and developed using a DAB (diaminobenzidine) Substrate Kit (#550880,
BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Counterstaining colour was
carried out using Harris modified haematoxylin. All immunostained slides were scanned on
the Automate Cellular Image System III (ACIS III) for quantification by digital image
analysis.
Bioinformatic analysis

Author Manuscript

We analysed the correlation between gene copy number and the corresponding gene
expression using data obtained from CCLE (www.broadinstitute.org/ccle) and TCGA
(http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) as previously described13. Enrichment of Pearson
correlation coefficients was determined by permuting gene names. To determine whether a
deleted gene functions as a housekeeping gene, we first analysed its expression profiles in
tumour and normal tissues as well as its general functions from literature. Second, we
checked gene conservation across species and lethality of the gene knockout by searching
available databases of model organisms (Saccharomyces Genome Database, WormBase,
FlyBase, and Mouse Genome Informatics). Third, we checked the proximity of the potential
target gene to the TP53 gene and analysed its co-deletion with TP53 in human cancers.
Finally, we searched for available cancer cell lines with the deletion of TP53 and the target
gene to test our hypothesis.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Each experiment was repeated three times or more. Unless otherwise noted, data are
presented as mean and s.d. or s.e.m., and Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used to
compare two groups of independent samples. In an unpaired t-test, we assumed equal
variance and no samples were excluded from the analysis. Statistical methods used for
TCGA data analysis are described above. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
