ABSTRACT
Gliomas are primary brain tumors for which surgical resection and radiotherapy
is difficult because of the diffuse infiltrative growth of the tumor into the brain
parenchyma. For development of alternative, drug-based, therapies more insight in
the molecular processes that steer this typical growth and morphodynamic behavior
of glioma cells is needed. Protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRZ-B is a transmembrane
signaling molecule that is found to be strongly up-regulated in glioma specimens.
We assessed the contribution of PTPRZ-B protein domains to tumor cell growth and
migration, via lentiviral knock-down and over-expression using clinically relevant
glioma xenografts and their derived cell models. PTPRZ-B knock-down resulted in
reduced migration and proliferation of glioma cells in vitro and also inhibited tumor
growth in vivo. Interestingly, expression of only the PTPRZ-B extracellular segment
was sufficient to rescue the in vitro migratory phenotype that resulted from PTPRZ-B
knock-down. In contrast, PTPRZ-B knock-down effects on proliferation could be
reverted only after re-expression of PTPRZ-B variants that contained its C-terminal
PDZ binding domain. Thus, distinct domains of PTPRZ-B are differentially required for
migration and proliferation of glioma cells, respectively. PTPRZ-B signaling pathways
therefore represent attractive therapeutic entry points to combat these tumors.

INTRODUCTION

occurrence of angiogenesis. This angiogenesis has been
combated using specific inhibitors in phase III trials, but
thus far therapeutic survival benefit is lacking because
the approach leaves the diffuse infiltrative component
unaffected or even increases diffuse growth [4-6].
Additional treatment modalities aiming at diffuse tumor
cells that escape surgery and radio-chemotherapy, hence
knowledge about the molecular mechanisms that underpin
glioma cell migration and proliferation in the brain
parenchyma, are therefore urgently needed.
Aberrant phosphotyrosine-based signaling is

Diffuse gliomas comprise a heterogeneous group
of glial brain tumors that share high migratory potential,
as evidenced by diffuse infiltration in the surrounding
brain parenchyma along white matter tracts and blood
vessels [1]. This phenotype severely reduces efficacy
of conventional therapeutic strategies, i.e. surgery and
radiotherapy [2]. A hallmark of the highly malignant

of less than 15 months [3], is the additional local

a hallmark of cancer, and gliomas are no exception;
tyrosine kinase membrane receptors like EGFR, ERBB2,
PDGFRA, MET and VEGFR2 have been implicated
in glioma growth, angiogenesis and cell motility [7]. A
role for the counter-acting protein tyrosine phosphatase
(PTP) enzyme family [8, 9] is much less studied. There
is compelling evidence that PTPs influence cell migration
[10], especially during neuronal development [8, 9].
Several PTPs have been linked to carcinoma development
[11, 12] and their involvement in glioma biology is
gradually being uncovered [13]. PTEN, for example, is
inactivated or absent in one-third of high-grade gliomas,
resulting in increased PI3K-mediated cell proliferation
and survival [7, 14]. For multiple additional PTPs the
contribution to glioma etiology, especially the diffuse
infiltration in the neuropil, requires further study.
Within the receptor-type PTP (RPTP) subfamily
there is a number of transmembrane enzymes that
resemble cell adhesion molecules, having extracellular
domains that might engage in interactions with
neighboring cells or extracellular matrix components [810]. These characteristics make RPTP genes, including
PTPRZ1, potentially important regulators of cell motility
and growth. PTPRZ1 encodes three isoforms (PTPRZ-A,
PTPRZ-B and phosphacan) that share a carbonic
anhydrase-like (CAH) and a fibronectin type III (FNIII)
domain at the protein’s N-terminus [15]. Furthermore, a
spacer with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan attachment
sites is present in isoforms PTPRZ-A and phosphacan.
PTPRZ-B lacks most of this spacer, resulting in a smaller
extracellular part. PTPRZ-A and PTPRZ-B have identical
intracellular parts consisting of a catalytically active
membrane-proximal and an inactive membrane-distal PTP
domain. The phosphacan isoform lacks these PTP domains
and represents a secreted protein [15]. Several PTPRZinteracting proteins have been identified. For instance, the
extracellular ligand pleotrophin binds to and inactivates
PTPRZ, thereby increasing the phosphorylation of
intracellular substrates β-catenin [16], Fyn [17], β-adducin
[18] and Alk [19]. Additional interaction partners include
contactin-1, which binds to the CAH domain [20], and
tenascin-C and -R that bind to the FNIII domain [21]. It
is thought that these proteins form complexes with the
extracellular matrix [22] to induce and facilitate migration.
PTPRZ expression, in particular PTPRZ-B [23],
is up-regulated in glioma tumor specimens [24-26].
PTPRZ1 knock-down in glioblastoma cell lines reduced
cell migration [25] and tumor growth [27], and PTPRZ
overexpression enhanced cell migration [24]. However,
these cell models produce circumscribed tumors that lack
the highly invasive phenotype when grown orthotopically
[28]. Furthermore, PTPRZ protein domains that steer
glioma cell behavior still need to be uncovered. Here we
investigated the role of PTPRZ and its protein domains,
exploiting glioma models that faithfully recapitulate
diffuse infiltrative growth in vivo [28-30]. Lentiviruswww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mediated knock-down and subsequent rescue experiments
revealed that PTPRZ-mediated effects on migration rely
exclusively on its extracellular domain, whereas impact
on proliferation depends on the intracellular carboxylterminal PDZ domain binding site. These findings
identify PTPRZ as a dual entry point for glioma therapy
development.

RESULTS
Modulation of PTPRZ-B expression levels in
glioblastoma cells
In line with previous reports [24-26], high PTPRZ1
expression levels are detectable in glioma tumors (data
not shown) and in human xenograft-derived cells in
culture (Fig. 1). The two well-characterized glioma
xenograft lines E98 and E434 [28] differ in their in vitro
culture regimen; anaplastic oligodendroglioma-derived
E434 cells only propagate under neurosphere growth
conditions, using serum-free neurobasal medium [31],
whereas glioblastoma-derived E98 cells additionally grow
in standard DMEM/10%FCS as an adherent monolayer
(Fig 1A). To assess PTPRZ influence on glioma growth
and migration, lentiviral vectors for PTPRZ-B expression
and PTPRZ1 shRNA-mediated knock-down (targeting all
three isoforms) were generated (supplementary Fig. S1).
We introduced a silent mutation in the PTPRZ-B open
reading frame to create an shRNA-insensitive lentiviral
PTPRZ-B expression construct and used this throughout
for validation and rescue purposes. Following lentiviral
transduction of E98 and E434 cells with PTPRZ1 shRNA,
a five- to twenty-fold reduction of PTPRZ1 transcript
levels (Fig. 1B,C) and a five- to ten-fold drop in PTPRZ-B
protein content (Fig. 1D,E) was obtained. As for C6
glioma cells [23], it is the short transmembrane variant
PTPRZ-B that was detected in E98 and E434 lysates (Fig.
1D,E). Use of the lentiviral PTPRZ-B expression vector
resulted in PTPRZ-B protein levels that were one to three
times that of the endogenous protein, also in presence of
PTPRZ1 shRNA (Fig. 1D).

PTPRZ-B stimulates glioma cell growth in vitro
PTPRZ-B over-expression and knock-down effects
on E98 and E434 cell proliferation was assessed via direct
measurement of cell content and via BrdU incorporation.
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) proliferation assays revealed
that PTPRZ1 knock-down significantly inhibited growth
of adherent E98 cells, as illustrated by an increased cell
doubling time (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, BrdU pulse-labeling
showed a significant reduction of the percentage of
S-phase cells in shPTPRZ1-transduced samples (p<0.05).
PTPRZ-B over-expression did not significantly affect E98

Knock-down of PTPRZ1 also resulted in
significantly delayed growth in E434 cells. Since these
cells can only be propagated as spheroids, we measured
proliferation capacity by means of the spheroid diameter
(Fig 2D-E). Fluorescent protein signals in the lentivirally
transduced cells were used to image spheroid size over
time. Whereas shSCR-transduced E434 spheroids showed
clear signs of growth, shPTPRZ1-transduced spheroids
only increased a little in size.

proliferation, in agreement with the modest increase in
PTPRZ-B levels on immunoblot. Nevertheless, PTPRZ1
knock-down effects were fully rescued by PTPRZ-B reexpression (Fig. 2B).
To investigate whether observed PTPRZ1 knockdown effects are on the level of cell viability, apoptosis
or cell cycle progression, BrdU pulse-labeled cells were
immunostained for BrdU, for the G1-S-G2-M marker Ki67 and for cleaved Caspase-3. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was less than 1% for all conditions (data not shown)
and, with the exception of PTPRZ1 knock-down cells,
approximately 20% of cells ended up BrdU-positive.
Intriguingly, always half of the cells stained positive for
Ki-67, even among shPTPRZ1-transduced cells of which
10% is in S-phase (Fig. 2B-C). This suggests that the
growth impairment upon PTPRZ1 knock-down reflects
increased duration of cell cycle time.

PTPRZ-B facilitates migration of E98 and E434
glioma cells
We next investigated whether PTPRZ1 influence
on cell migration [24, 25] is represented in our glioma
models. Following PTPRZ1 knock-down, migration of

individual E98 cells in a 3D Matrigel/agarose environment
was significantly reduced (p<0.001), an effect that was
rescued by expression of the shRNA-insensitive PTPRZ-B
transcript in knock-down cells (Fig. 3A-B). To confirm
this in a different setting, we generated transduced E98
spheroids using the hanging-drop method. Resulting
homogeneously sized E98 spheroids were subsequently
placed on a thin Matrigel layer for 24 hours and migratory
performance of outgrowing cells, expressed as distance
travelled from the edge of the spheroid [32], was
calculated semi-automatically. Again, PTPRZ1 knockdown cells migrated significantly less (p<0.05) than
scrambled controls, and restoration of PTPRZ-B levels
rescued this phenotype (Fig. 3C-D). Of note, PTPRZ-B
over-expression by itself did not alter E98 motility. In a
similar fashion, outgrowth of lentivirally transduced E434

spheroids was inhibited by PTPRZ knock-down (p<0.05;
Figure 3E-F). Interestingly, whereas outgrowing E98 cells
presented as scattered, amoeboid-like migrating cells, the
migrating E434 cells largely remained interconnected,
suggestive of collective migration [33]. Taken together,
the reduced migration in vitro due to PTPRZ1 knockdown, which was rescued following PTPRZ-B reexpression, corroborates a facilitating role for PTPRZ-B
in cell motility.

tumors was similar in compact and diffuse infiltrative areas

spheroids they display diffuse infiltrative properties (our
unpublished results). Stably transduced E98 cells were

expression construct (Figs. 2-3), we tested the contribution

of the individual PTPRZ-B protein domains using this
assay. Three different shRNA-resistant PTPRZ-B cDNA
versions were generated (Fig. 5A). In PTPRZ-B ecto-VSV
the transmembrane and intracellular PTPRZ-B segments
were replaced by a VSV-G epitope tag, effectively leading
to the secretion of a C-terminally tagged PTPRZ-B
extracellular domain (Fig. 5B). PTPRZ-B C/S represents

demonstrate a dual oncogenic role for PTPRZ1 in glioma
cells. The PTPRZ-B intracellular PDZ domain binding site
is required to orchestrate a submembranous complex that
boosts cell proliferation, while the extracellular portion
binds receptors and adhesion molecules on nearby cells
and stimulates migration.

a cysteine-to-serine catalytically inactive mutant, and in
PTPRZ-B-VSV the ‘SLVCOOH’ PDZ domain target site is
blocked by a C-terminal VSV-G tag. Expression of all
constructs was readily detected in E98-shPTPRZ1 cells
(Fig 5B-C).
BrdU pulse-labeling experiments revealed that
reduction in percentage of cells in S-phase, due to knockdown of endogenous PTPRZ, was fully rescued by fulllength PTPRZ-B and the inactive PTPRZ-B C/S mutant.
Expression of PTPRZ-B ecto-VSV or PTPRZ-B-VSV
did not rescue the knock-down phenotype (Fig. 5DE). Thus, PTPRZ-B impacts on cell cycle progression
through mechanisms that are independent of PTPRZ-B
phosphatase activity and require interactions with the
PTPRZ PDZ domain target site.

DISCUSSION
Effective treatment of glioma patients requires that
also tumor cells that diffusely spread out into the brain
parenchyma are therapeutically addressed. In the current
study we assessed the contributions of different PTPRZ-B
domains to glioma cell migration and proliferation using
models that faithfully recapitulate infiltrative tumor
growth. We show that PTPRZ1 knock-down in E98
glioblastoma and E434 oligodendroglioma cells results
in impaired growth and motility in vitro and reduced
tumor growth in vivo, also in diffuse infiltrative tumor
areas. Furthermore, our rescue experiments disclose
a dyad functionality for this RPTP. The intracellular
PTPRZ-B C-terminal PDZ domain binding site, and not its
enzymatic PTP activity, turned out essential for effects on
cell proliferation. Conversely, the PTPRZ-B extracellular
moiety, which in part resembles the naturally occurring
phosphacan isoform, impacted on cell migration.
PTPRZ1 is upregulated in gliomas, which likely
contributes to enhanced tumor cell migration [2426]. A role for PTPRZ in proliferation was less clear.
Reduction of tumor growth as well as absence of
growth effects have been reported for PTPRZ1 knockdown experiments [25, 27]. Administration of soluble
PTPRZ ectodomain is known to inhibit proliferation of
oligodendroglial precursor cells [36]. In our study, the
PTPRZ-B ectodomain did not affect the reduction of
E98 cells in S-phase that resulted from PTPRZ1 knockdown. Addition of wild-type or enzymatically inactive
PTPRZ-B did suffice to rescue proliferation impairment,
but a C-terminally tagged version did not. If PTPRZ
phosphatase activity would have been crucial for glioma
cell proliferation, expression of an inactive ‘substrate
protection’ mutant in PTPRZ1 knock-down cells might act
dominant-negative and worsen the effect. On the contrary,
proliferation rescue by the catalytically dead PTPRZ-B
mutant and not by the C-terminally tagged version rather
implicates PTPRZ-B’s C-terminal protein interaction
potential as important for signaling complexes that steer
glioma proliferation. As yet we cannot rule out that also
protein interactions mediated by PTPRZ-B domains other
than its C-terminal PDZ domain binding motif contribute
to its proliferation signaling mode.
Multiple PDZ-containing proteins have been
reported to bind to the PTPRZ C-terminus; PSD95 [37],
MAGI-3 [38], MAGI-1, GOPC, Mupp1, Synj2bp, Snta1,
Sntb1 and Veli-3 [39]. This opens up several mechanisms
by which PTPRZ may influence proliferation. For instance,

Extracellular PTPRZ-B interactions impact on
glioma cell migration
Rescuing abilities of PTPRZ-B variants were also
assessed in the spheroid migration assay. Migratory
impairment due to PTPRZ1 knock-down in E98shPTPRZ1 cells was effectively rescued upon reexpression of full-length PTPRZ-B, PTPRZ-B C/S and,
importantly, also by PTPRZ-B ecto-VSV (Fig. 6A-B).
Moreover, purified VSV-tagged PTPRZ-B ectodomains,
isolated from conditioned medium of transfected HEK293FT cells, also rescued the PTPRZ knock-down effect
on E98 cell migration (Fig. 6C). Contactin-1 has been put
forward as a membrane-anchored PTPRZ ligand, binding
to the CAH domain and impacting on cell migration [22].
In line with this, endogenous contactin-1 from E98 cells
indeed bound to PTPRZ-B ecto-VSV that was preloaded
onto anti-VSV antibody-coupled beads (Fig. 6D),
underscoring PTPRZ-B – contactin-1 interplay in E98
glioma cells.
Our results did not disclose PTPRZ phosphatase
activity as a regulator of glioma cell migration and
proliferation. It is reasonable to assume, however, that the
phosphotyrosine-controlled activity of cellular kinases is
affected following PTPRZ1 knockdown in E98 cells. A
comparison of E98-SCR and E98-shPTPRZ1 cell extracts
in a tyrosine kinase microarray activity assay [35] revealed
that PTPRZ1 knock-down cells displayed reduced
activity, most notably towards PDGFRB- and METderived peptides (Supplementary Fig. S2). We previously
reported on the importance of MET for E98 cell migration
[32]. Immunoblot analyses confirmed that in shPTPRZ1expressing E98 cell lysates MET tyrosine phosphorylation
was reduced four-fold (Fig. 6E). Additionally, PTPRZ1
knock-down also resulted in lower MET protein levels,
suggesting that PTPRZ-B regulates MET transcription,
synthesis or degradation. Interestingly, PTPRZ1 knockdown effects on MET are partly alleviated by PTPRZ-B
ecto-VSV expression (Fig. 6F). Taken together, results

tyrosine kinase ErbB4 auto-activation is suppressed
by PSD95 through PDZ domain-mediated interactions
with both the enzyme PTPRZ and the substrate ErbB4
[40]. Likewise, PTPRZ and its substrate β-catenin form
a complex through MAGI-1 [39, 41]. However, current
findings argue against an enzymatic role for PTPRZ
in such PDZ-based complexes and rather point to a
scaffolding role. By clustering proteins submembranously
in glioma cells, PTPRZ might contribute to efficient
funneling of growth stimulatory signals towards the cell’s
interior.
In both our glioblastoma and anaplastic
oligodendroglioma model, the PTPRZ ectodomain did
not impinge on proliferation but rather was instrumental
for migration. Also in U87-MG glioblastoma cells, PTPRZ
positively influenced adherence and migration [24] and an
antibody targeting the PTPRZ extracellular region delayed
U87-MG compact tumor formation in vivo [42]. PTPRZ
ectodomain binding partners include extracellular matrix
components like pleiotrophin, tenascin-C and tenascin-R,
and cell surface molecules [36] like contactin-1 [20,
21]. Extracellular binding of PTPRZ and contactin-1
is hypothesized to recruit additional proteins, such as
tenascins, to the complex [22]. In oligodendroglial
precursors this inhibits proliferation and triggers
differentiation towards myelinating cells. In our glioma
models, PTPRZ-contactin-1 interactions apparently lead
to migratory responses. This difference may result from
separate PTPRZ-mediated interactions in either system or,
alternatively, by absence or presence of facilitator proteins
involved. Contactin-1, tenascin-C and tenascin-R have
adhesion and migration effects in glioma cells [21, 24, 25,
42, 43].
Recently we showed that MET inhibition by
cabozantinib effectively stops E98 cell migration [32].
Here, migration impairment in E98-shPTPRZ1 cells
co-incided with reduced MET activity. For a candidate
substrate, rather increased phosphorylation levels are
expected upon knock-down of PTPRZ, and thus far MET
does not meet PTPRZ substrate criteria [44]. Together
with ErbB and PDGFR family members, MET represents
one of the oncogenic drivers in glioma tumor biology
[7]. Whereas E98 cells displayed a scattered, single-cell
migration pattern in spheroid outgrowth experiments,
E434 cells showed a more collective migratory behavior.
This may reflect MET signaling differences in the two
models, bearing in mind ‘scatter factor receptor’ as
alternative name for MET. In our in vivo experiments
we were unable to assess PTPRZ-B’s migratory role
on tumor formation because this was blurred by effects
on cell proliferation. Current findings now provide a
basis to experimentally separate both type of effects
through independent targeting of PTPRZ-B intracellular
and extracellular binding potential. Further knowledge
on PTPRZ intracellular and extracellular signaling
involvement will strengthen its candidacy as a therapeutic

target in gliomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental details on cell lines and antibodies
used, plasmid construction, lentiviral transduction,
immuno-blotting, -precipitation and –histochemical
procedures, peptide microarray analysis, and statistical
analyses are provided as supplementary material.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
E98 cells were grown on collagen I-coated (10
µg/cm2; Invitrogen) coverslips to 60-80% confluency,
and incubated for 1hr with culture medium containing
BrdU (50 μM; Life Technologies, #B23151). Cells
were then washed three times with PBS and fixated
in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (PB: 46 mM NaH2 PO4; 354 mM Na2HPO4, pH
7.4). Subsequently, coverslips were washed with PBS
and quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS. Cells were
blocked and permeabilized for 1hr in blocking buffer
(5% Normal Goat Serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS)
and then incubated for 2.5hrs with anti-BrdU, anti-Ki67
or anti-cleaved Caspase 3 antibodies in blocking buffer
with added DNAseI (100 ng/mL; Roche) and MgCl2 (2.5
mM) at 37 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with goatanti-mouse Alexa 488 and goat-anti-rabbit Alexa 647
secondary antibodies in PBS. Coverslips were mounted
on microscope slides in DAPI-containing Mowiol (SigmaAldrich) and images were collected on a Leica DMRA
Fluorescence microscope, equipped with a DFC340 FX
CCD camera, using 40x and 63x objectives. DAPI- and
BrdU-positive nuclei and cleaved Caspase 3-positive cells
were counted using FIJI software [45].
For proliferation assays, stably transduced E98
cells were seeded in triplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate
(10,000 cells/well), and cultured in 10% FCS-containing
DMEM. At various time points, cells were washed with
PBS and fixed using 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1hr at
4 °C, washed with water and afterwards frozen until all
time points were collected. Cells were then stained with
1% Sulforhodamine B (SRB; Sigma-Aldrich) in 1% acetic
acid for 20 minutes. Plates were subsequently washed with
1% acetic acid and dried at 60 °C for 3 hrs. Protein-bound
SRB was then dissolved in 10 mM Tris (pH 10.5) and
absorption was measured at 510 nm using a micro-plate
reader (Bio-Rad).
Lentivirally transduced E434 spheroids were seeded
in a 96-well imaging plate (BD Biosciences, #353219)
and allowed to settle overnight. The next day, images
were taken using a BD Pathway 855 high-content bioimager (BD Biosciences). Fluorescent images (TagRFP
or EGFP-based) were taken longitudinally at days 4,
6 and 8 and the average increase in spheroid area was

had been taken on the fourth day, half of the medium was
replenished and spheroid growth was continued.

spheroids in supplemented neurobasal medium for at least
two weeks prior to orthotopic injection [29]. A 20 μL cell
suspension (107 cells/mL in PBS) containing a mixture
of shSCR/GFP and shPTPRZ1/TagRFP labeled cells was
injected per animal (n=5 and 4 for E98 and E434 cells,
respectively). Prior to injection, the ratio of GFP- and
TagRFP-positive cells was determined using an EVOS
fluorescence imaging system (AMG) and FIJI Software.
Animals were closely monitored and sacrificed when signs
of tumor burden (especially weight loss and neurological
dysfunction) were observed. Brains were harvested, and
parts were either formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for
(immuno)histochemical analysis.

2D and 3D migration assays
E98 spheroids were generated by the hanging-drop
method. In brief, 0.7 mL methylcellulose (12 mg/mL;
Sigma, M6385) was added to 4.3 mL E98 cell suspension
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (500,000 cells
total) and 25 µL drops were seeded in a dry culture dish.
The dish was then inverted and incubated overnight at 37
°C in the presence of 5% CO2. The next day, individual
spheroids were seeded in a 96-well imaging culture dish
(BD Falcon, #353219) coated with Matrigel (30 μg/mL
PBS; BD Biosciences, #356237) and further incubated in
DMEM with 10% FCS, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For E434,
cultured spheroids were directly plated onto Matrigelcoated wells containing B27-supplemented neurobasal
medium. After 24 hrs, wells were washed with PBS and
cells were fixed with 2% PFA in 0.1 M PB, followed by
DAPI staining. Fluorescent images were collected on a
high-content microscope (Leica DMI6000B) extended
with a motorized x-y scanning stage (Leica EL6000
illumination source), and FIJI software [45] was used
to automatically quantify spheroid outgrowth. Briefly,
cells which migrated from the spheroids were selected,
coordinates of each individual cell were determined, and
distance from the spheroid border was calculated using
the coordinates and radius of the spheroid. For each
experiment the average cell migration distance across all
spheroids (n>31) was calculated.
Cell cultures in solidified Matrigel/Agarose matrices
were prepared as follows. 10 μL Matrigel and 5 μL 2%
agarose (Seaplaque Agarose; Lonza #50101 in PBS) were
mixed with 35 μL 10% FCS-containing DMEM and 50 µL
of Matrigel/agarose mix was added to the wells of a 96well microtiter plate which was placed on ice. One minute
later, 50 µL cell suspension (50,000 cells) was mixed
resulting in a 3D environment containing cells. Cells were
imaged overnight with 10-min intervals on a time lapse
system (Nikon Diaphot 300 with Hamamatsu C8484-05G
CCD Camera, Okolab 4 well CO2 stage incubator and
Okolab 2D time lapse software) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with
a 10x objective. Cells were manually tracked for at least 2
hrs using the FIJI plug-in [45].
