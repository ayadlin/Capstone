Abstract
Prostate cancer progression can be associated with androgen receptor (AR) mutations acquired following
treatment with castration and/or an antiandrogen. Abiraterone, a rationally designed inhibitor of CYP17A1
recently approved for the treatment of docetaxel-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is often
effective, but requires coadministration with glucocorticoids to curtail side effects. Here, we hypothesized that
progressive disease on abiraterone may occur secondary to glucocorticoid-induced activation of mutated AR. We
found that prednisolone plasma levels in patients with CRPC were sufÔ¨Åciently high to activate mutant AR.
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone and eplerenone that are used to treat side effects
related to mineralocorticoid excess, can also bind to and activate signaling through wild-type or mutant AR.
Abiraterone inhibited in vitro proliferation and AR-regulated gene expression of AR-positive prostate cancer cells,
which could be explained by AR antagonism in addition to inhibition of steroidogenesis. In fact, activation of
mutant AR by eplerenone was inhibited by MDV3100, bicalutamide, or greater concentrations of abiraterone.
Therefore, an increase in abiraterone exposure could reverse resistance secondary to activation of AR by residual
ligands or coadministered drugs. Together, our Ô¨Åndings provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of
combined CYP17A1 inhibition and AR antagonism. Cancer Res; 72(9); 2176‚Äì82. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The small-molecule CYP17A1 inhibitor, abiraterone acetate
(Zytiga, Janssen), was recently approved for the treatment of
men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy. Despite a signiÔ¨Åcant survival advantage with 1,000 mg abiraterone daily and objective
tumor responses in up to 60% of patients with CRPC, progressive disease on treatment invariably develops (1, 2). MDV3100
is a novel antiandrogen (3, 4) that has also recently been

reported to confer a survival advantage in patients with CRPC
progressing after docetaxel (5). As prostate-speciÔ¨Åc antigen
(PSA) level often increases at progression on both these agents,
we have hypothesized that resistance occurs secondary to
reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Inhibition
of CYP17A1 results in signiÔ¨Åcant suppression of androgens and
estrogens but also of cortisol that is associated with a compensatory increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone level (2).
Abiraterone acetate has therefore been developed in combination with exogenous glucocorticoids. However, up to 40% of
patients on prednisone/prednisolone alone and 55% of
patients on abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone
develop a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess
characterized by hypokalemia, hypertension, and Ô¨Çuid overload that can be controlled by increasing the dose of prednisone or adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)
such as eplerenone (1). Eplerenone is currently recommended
in preference to spironolactone as previous studies showed
that eplerenone did not bind and activate wild-type (WT)-AR
(2, 6). However, as eplerenone is not invariably available,
spironolactone is also being used.
Point mutations of the AR, which appear to cluster in the
ligand-binding domain, are rare in therapy naive patients but
occur in 15% to 45% of castration-resistant disease and can
increase AR afÔ¨Ånity for a wide range of steroids (7, 8). Over 100

Interaction of AR with Abiraterone and Eplerenone

mutations have been described and many have been shown to
give a functional advantage to maintain AR signaling. We
hypothesized that progressive disease on abiraterone acetate
could occur secondary to activation of mutated "promiscuous"
AR by steroidal agents administered to patients to prevent or
treat side effects of mineralocorticoid excess.

Materials and Methods
Materials
FBS and charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) were purchased
from Gibco. Bicalutamide, dexamethasone, prednisone, and
dihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma-Aldrich), titrated [3H]R1881 (Perkin-Elmer), R1881 (Steraloids), eplerenone and spironolactone (Tocris-Bioscience) were obtained from commercial sources. Abiraterone and MDV3100 were synthesized using
the publicly available chemical structures and checked by mass
spectrometry. Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and then diluted to a maximum DMSO concentration
of 0.2%. LNCaP, VCaP, PC-3, DU145, and COS-7 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; LGC
Standards), grown according to ATCC recommendations, used
less than 6 months from receipt and freeze down and conÔ¨Årmed mycoplasma free.
Luciferase reporter assays
We constructed a PSA-ARE3-luc luciferase reporter plasmid
that was cotransfected with a human AR expression plasmid,
F527-AR [wild-type or mutant as stated; mutations conÔ¨Årmed
by sequencing (Beckman Coulter Genomics)] into PC-3 cells.
These were seeded in white opaque 384-well plates and grown
in 10% CSS-supplemented phenol red‚Äìfree RPMI-1640 for 30
hours. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentration of compound and R1881 for 16 hours. Luciferase activity
was determined by adding ONE Glo (Promega) and measuring
luminescence on a TopCount plate reader (Perkin-Elmer).
Transfection efÔ¨Åciency and protein expression are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1.
Cell viability
LNCaP and VCaP cells were seeded in 96-well plates and
grown in CSS-supplemented phenol red‚Äìfree or FBS-supplemented media for 7 days. Cells were treated with compound at
24 and 96 hours after plating and cell viability was determined
on day 7 by adding CellTiter Glo (Promega) and measuring
luminescence.
Ligand-binding assay
PC-3 cells transfected with wild-type or T877A mutant AR or
LNCaP cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown in CSSsupplemented phenol red‚Äìfree media for 24 hours. To determine the kinetics of [3H]-R1881 binding to the wild-type and
T877A AR, cells were treated with 0.25 to 25 nmol/L [3H]-R1881
for 2 hours, then washed, lysed, and radioactivity was measured
(1900CA analyzer, Perkin-Elmer). The Kd and Bmax were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software. When the concentration of [3H]-R1881 required to
almost saturate AR in both wild-type and T877A AR mutant

www.aacrjournals.org

transfections was established (5 nmol/l), displacement of [3H]R1881 by test compound was determined. The concentration
at which 50% of [3H]-R1881 was displaced (EC50) was established using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism).
Quantitative real time-PCR
LNCaP and VCaP cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
grown in CSS-supplemented phenol red‚Äìfree media for 24
hours and then treated for 5 hours as indicated. Following
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was carried out on the Mx3000P QPCR System
(Agilent) using the RT2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix
(SABiosciences). Every sample was run in duplicate and each
reaction contained 50 ng of cDNA in a total volume of 20 mL.
DCt for each gene was determined after normalization to
actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), and DDCt was calculated relative to the designated reference sample. Gene expression values were set equal
to 2 DDCt (Applied Biosystems). Primers were purchased
from SABiosciences.
Measurement of plasma prednisolone
Plasma was collected from patients with CRPC after 48 days
of continuous daily abiraterone acetate and prednisolone. All
patients provided written, informed consent to blood withdrawal for research purposes, and this study was approved by
the Royal Marsden Hospital ethics review committees. Prednisolone was quantiÔ¨Åed by comparison to a calibration series
ranging from 5 to 500 ng/mL prepared in 50:50 methanol:water.
A Waters Xevo mass spectrometer with Acquity uPLC system
was used, Ô¨Åtted with a HSS T3, 1.8 mm, 1.2  50 mm2 column
(Waters). The column temperature was maintained at 60 C
and the settings used were an electrospray source in positive
ionization mode; capillary voltage 4.0 kV; source temperature,
150 C; and desolvation temperature, 500 C.

Results
The selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist,
eplerenone, activates mutant AR
We Ô¨Årst cotransfected PC-3 AR-negative prostate cancer
cells with PSA-ARE2-luc and either wild-type (WT)-AR or 3
mutations previously described in CRPC (T877A-AR, D879GAR, and W741C-AR). The T877A mutation has been identiÔ¨Åed
in several studies in patients treated with Ô¨Çutamide (8, 9) and
has been extensively studied as it is found in the LNCaP
prostate cancer cell line (Supplementary Table S1). D879G
and W741C mutations have been identiÔ¨Åed in patients previously treated with bicalutamide (8, 9). We then compared
activation of wild-type or mutant AR by synthetic androgen
(R1881) to activation by the MRAs, eplerenone, and spironolactone. In keeping with previous reports, spironolactone
activates WT-AR (7) and also T877A-AR, D879G-AR, and
W741C-AR only 2-log less potently than R1881 does (Fig. 1A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S2). Eplerenone does not
activate WT-AR, D879G-AR, or W741C-AR but importantly
can activate T877A-AR with a dose-proportional response
and an EC50 value of 5.2 mmol/L [95% conÔ¨Ådence interval (CI),

Figure 1. Eplerenone activates T877A-AR and spironolactone activates both T877A-AR and wild-type (WT)-AR. Sigmoidal dose‚Äìresponse curves show

change from the DMSO control was plotted and EC50 values calculated using nonlinear regression (GraphPad). EC50 values and 95% CIs are given. C, LNCaP
and VCaP prostate cancer cells in CSS were treated with eplerenone or spironolactone alone or in combination with 0.1, 1, or 5 mmol/L abiraterone, 10 mmol/L
bicalutamide, or 10 mmol/L MDV3100 for 7 days and then analyzed for cell viability. Fold change from the DMSO control was then calculated and plotted.

Pharmacokinetic studies with eplerenone report a Cmax of 1.72
 0.28 mg/mL (equivalent to 4.2  0.7 mmol/L) and a half-life of
3 hours with 100 mg eplerenone (6); doses of eplerenone
between 50 and 200 mg are used to treat toxicities secondary
to mineralocorticoid excess from abiraterone in patients with
CRPC (Supplementary Table S2). We proceeded to conÔ¨Årm
that both spironolactone and eplerenone (1 and 10 mmol/L)
increased proliferation of hormone-stripped LNCaP (T877AAR) but only spironolactone increased the proliferation of
VCaP (WT-AR; Fig. 1C). The increase in proliferation was
inhibited by AR antagonism, suggesting this effect was secondary to binding to and activation of the AR (Fig. 1C).
Similarly, eplerenone signiÔ¨Åcantly increased expression of the
androgen-regulated and clinically important genes PSA and
TMPRSS2 in LNCaP but not in VCaP (Fig. 1D).

Exogenous glucocorticoids can activate mutant AR at
clinically relevant doses observed in CRPC patients
treated with abiraterone acetate
Prednisolone or its precursor prednisone are commonly
administered in combination with abiraterone acetate
although 2 phase II studies combined abiraterone acetate with
dexamethasone (2, 10). Prednisone and dexamethasone do not
activate WT-AR but activate T877A-AR with EC50 values of 25.1
mmol/L (95% CI, 12.64‚Äì36.83 mmol/L) and 21.6 mmol/L (95% CI,
12.53‚Äì50.26 mmol/L), respectively (Fig. 1A and B). Previous
reports have shown that other AR mutations such as T877A in
combination with L701H are highly sensitive to glucocorticoids
with activation by concentrations as low as 10 nmol/L (11). We
therefore proceeded to measure plasma levels of prednisolone
in 15 patients with CRPC on continuous daily treatment with
1,000 mg abiraterone acetate and 10 mg prednisolone.

Interaction of AR with Abiraterone and Eplerenone

to conÔ¨Årm downregulation by qPCR of PSA and TMPRSS2 in
LNCaP cells treated with abiraterone (Fig. 3D).

Figure 2. Plasma concentrations (nmol/L) of prednisolone in 15 patients
with CRPC treated with abiraterone acetate measured with liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The median concentration
of 152 nmol/L (SD, 100 nmol/L) is marked by the solid line. The 10 nmol/L
limit above which activation of T877A-L701H-AR has been previously
reported to occur is shown by the dashed line.

Prednisolone levels were less than 4 nmol/L in 2 patients but
more than 30 nmol/L in the other 13 patients. The median
concentration was 153 nmol/L (range, <4‚Äì305 nmol/L; Fig. 2
and Supplementary Table S2).
Abiraterone binds and inhibits wild-type and mutant AR
Following the observation of activation of T877A-AR
by eplerenone, we proceeded to evaluate the effect of abiraterone on wild-type and mutant AR (T877A, D879G, R629Q,
W741C, and M749L). We did not observe an increase in
reporter luciferase activity with doses of abiraterone up to
25 mmol/L with WT-AR or any mutation tested (Supplementary Fig. S3) but observed dose-proportional inhibition of
stimulated wild-type and mutant AR activity (Fig. 3A) with
signiÔ¨Åcant inhibition observed at doses 10 mmol/L. Inhibition was however not as potent as for same concentrations of
MDV3100. We then proceeded to conÔ¨Årm our Ô¨Åndings by
comparing inhibition of AR activation using abiraterone or
MDV3100 in a different model system (COS-7 cells cotransfected with AR and a GRE2-TATA-luc reporter gene and
activated by 10 nmol/L DHT for 24 hours). Similarly we
observed dose-proportional inhibition of WT-AR, T877A-AR,
G142V-AR, P533S-AR, T575A-AR, and H874Y-AR by abiraterone (Fig. 3B). Higher concentrations of abiraterone were
required for inhibition of R629Q-AR in this system than was
observed in PC-3 cells transfected with an ARE3-luc assay (Fig.
3A). We also conÔ¨Årmed signiÔ¨Åcant inhibition of proliferation of
the AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and VCaP
with doses of abiraterone 1 mmol/L (Fig. 3C). No inhibitory
effect was observed with the AR-negative prostate cancer cell
lines, PC-3, and DU145 (Supplementary Fig. S4). We proceeded

Binding of abiraterone or eplerenone to the AR is
conÔ¨Årmed by competitive displacement of [3H]-R1881
To conÔ¨Årm that AR antagonism by abiraterone and agonism by eplerenone (both previously undescribed) occurred
secondary to binding to the AR ligand‚Äìbinding domain, we
used a competitive radiolabeled assay to show displacement
of R1881 from PC-3 cells transfected with either WT-AR or
T877A-AR. The EC50 value of eplerenone for WT-AR was
6-fold higher than T877A-AR (EC50, 2.4 mmol/l; 95% CI, 2.0‚Äì
2.9 mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B). In keeping with the inhibitory
activity of abiraterone observed in our reporter luciferase
studies, abiraterone displaced ligand from both WT-AR
(EC50, 13.4 mmol/L; 95% CI, 10.3‚Äì17.4 mmol/L) and T877A
(EC50, 7.9 mmol/L; 95% CI, 6.7‚Äì9.3 mmol/L; Fig. 4A and B). We
also conÔ¨Årmed displacement of radiolabeled R1881 from
LNCaP with abiraterone (EC50, 2.6 mmol/L; 95% CI, 1.0‚Äì6.8
mmol/L) and eplerenone (EC50, 4.3 mmol/L; 95% CI, 2.4‚Äì7.8
mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S5).
Mutant AR activation by eplerenone can be inhibited by
abiraterone or bicalutamide but most effectively by
MDV3100
We observed dose-proportional growth inhibition with
abiraterone of LNCaP cells stimulated by eplerenone and of
LNCaP and VCaP cells stimulated by spironolactone (Fig. 1C).
Similar levels of inhibition were observed with bicalutamide,
with more profound inhibition by MDV3100 (Fig. 1C). Abiraterone, MDV3100, and bicalutamide achieved similar levels
of inhibition of upregulation of PSA by eplerenone but
MDV3100 inhibited induction of TMPRSS2 expression more
signiÔ¨Åcantly than bicalutamide or abiraterone (Fig. 3D). Similarly, MDV3100 showed more signiÔ¨Åcant inhibition of spironolactone-stimulated PSA and TMPRSS2 expressions than
abiraterone or bicalutamide (Supplementary Fig. S6). Also,
abiraterone (5 mmol/L) signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited activation of
T877A-AR (in transfected PC-3) by 1 mmol/L eplerenone but
not by 10 mmol/L eplerenone; stimulation by 10 mmol/L
eplerenone was signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibited by both bicalutamide
and MDV3100 (Fig. 4C).
Increased hormone levels reduce AR inhibition by
MDV3100
Recent studies have suggested that intratumoral testosterone levels increase in patients treated with MDV3100 (12). We
found that 1mmol/L and 10 mmol/L MDV3100 signiÔ¨Åcantly
inhibited WT-AR luciferase activity stimulated by 0.1 nmol/L
R1881 or 1 nmol/L DHT, respectively, but 50mmol/L
MDV3100 was required to signiÔ¨Åcantly inhibit AR stimulated
by 1 nmol/L R1881 (Fig. 4D) or 10 nmol/L DHT (Supplementary
Fig. S7).

Discussion
Abiraterone was developed as a speciÔ¨Åc CYP17A1 inhibitor (13). Previous studies have failed to identify binding of

calculated and then percentage change relative to the R1881-stimulated DMSO control was determined. Data shown are representative of 3 independent
experiments and represent mean and SEM of 8 replicates. B, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with GRE2-TATA-luc and the wild-type or mutant human
expression plasmid pSVARo (T877A, G142V, P533S, T575A, H874Y, R629Q). Cells were treated with 0.1 to 5 mmol/L abiraterone or MDV3100 in CSS medium
containing 10 nmol/L DHT for 24 hours. The luciferase activities were assayed in duplicate and normalized for the amounts of expressed AR determined
immunologically by dot blot analysis and normalized for protein concentration. The change in normalized luciferase activity relative to cells incubated
without any compound for each AR variant was determined. Data shown represent 2 or 3 independent experiments carried out in quadruplicate.

for cell viability. Fold change from the DMSO control was then calculated and plotted. Data shown are the mean (error bars, SEM) of 3 independent experiments

abiraterone to the AR (14). However, in this study we used
both reporter luciferase and competitive radiolabeled assays
to show that abiraterone binds and inhibits WT-AR. Another
study published while our article was under review reported
supporting evidence that abiraterone binds the AR and
produces a dose-dependent decrease in AR levels (15). This
study failed to identify the EC50 value with wild-type
or mutant AR but predicted it as over 3 mmol/L. We
also tested 8 AR mutations selected from a screen of 42
mutations for causing a differential response to various
hormones. We included mutations in the amino terminal
(G142V, P533S), DNA-binding (T575A), and ligand-binding
(W741C, M749L, T877A, D879G, and H874Y) domains and

the hinge region (R629Q; Supplementary Table S1). As
previously described, bicalutamide activated W741C
(4, 16) but no agonistic activity was observed with any
mutation and abiraterone. Similarly MDV3100 potently
inhibited WT-AR and all mutant AR tested. However, these
mutations were mostly identiÔ¨Åed in patients progressing on
bicalutamide or Ô¨Çutamide and different, new mutations may
develop in patients progressing on abiraterone or MDV3100.
Abiraterone is an active treatment for CRPC due to CYP17A1
inhibition and signiÔ¨Åcant suppression of hormones (2). However, we observed up to 32% AR inhibition with 1 mmol/L
abiraterone, with signiÔ¨Åcantly greater inhibition at 5 and 10
mmol/L. Pharmacokinetic studies have reported maximum

hormone levels reduce AR inhibition by MDV3100. PC-3 cells were cotransfected with ARE3-luc and WT-AR. Cells were treated with R1881 in combination
with DMSO or MDV3100 at the concentrations indicated for 16 hours and then analyzed for luciferase activity. Fold change from the DMSO control
was calculated. Data shown are from 3 independent experiments and represent mean and SEM of 24 replicates.   , P < 0.01 relative to R1881
or DHT control with DMSO (one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction).

plasma levels after a single 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate
in fasting patients of 1.2 to 5 mmol/L, conÔ¨Årming AR antagonism could occur at clinically achievable doses (Supplementary Table S2; refs. 2, 17). Higher doses of abiraterone up to at
least 2,000 mg daily are safely tolerated (2) and greater activity
could be observed with increased drug exposure despite
complete CYP17A1 inhibition at lower doses. This could be
achieved by administration with food (2, 17). Moreover, several
studies of abiraterone have now reported preclinical in vitro
and in vivo antitumor activity and inhibition of AR nuclear
localization and AR-regulated transcription that was attributed entirely to inhibition of steroidogenesis (18, 19) but could in
fact be partly explained by AR antagonism. Similarly, in vitro
inhibition of LNCaP and VCaP cells in our study could also be
explained by abiraterone's effect on steroidogenesis.
SigniÔ¨Åcant activation of both wild-type and mutant AR is
observed with spironolactone that should be avoided in all
patients with CRPC. We also show activation of T877A-AR by

eplerenone that was developed as a novel, non‚ÄìAR-binding
MRA (6). This could underlie clinical resistance in a proportion
of patients. Similarly, exogenous glucocorticoids that are
currently administered in combination with abiraterone
reach levels in patients that have been previously shown to
activate mutant L701H T877A AR (11). Activation of "promiscuous" AR by coadministered drugs or residual hormones (as
we reported recently ref. 20) could be inhibited by increasing
the dose of abiraterone or possibly more effectively, combining
with a potent antiandrogen such as MDV3100. Because of
toxicity the dose of MDV3100 selected for phase III development was 160 mg daily that achieves median plasma concentrations up to approximately 35 mmol/L (3, 4). AR inhibition at
these concentrations could be overcome by an increase in
hormones that would be prevented by combination with
abiraterone acetate. Overall these observations provide a
strong rationale for clinical evaluation of combined CYP17A1
inhibition and AR antagonism.
