ABSTRACT
In the present study, we provide a comparative phenotypic and genotypic
analysis of azacitidine-sensitive and resistant SKM-1 cell lines. Morphologically,
SKM1-R exhibited increase in cell size that accounts for by enhanced ploidy in a
majority of cells as shown by cell cycle and karyotype analysis. No specific Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) alteration was found in SKM1-R cells compared
to their SKM1-S counterpart. Comparative pangenomic profiling revealed the upregulation of a panel of genes involved in cellular movement, cell death and survival
and down-regulation of genes required for cell to cell signaling and free radical
scavenging in SKM1-R cells. We also searched for mutations frequently associated
with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and found that both cell lines harbored
mutations in TET2, ASLX1 and TP53. Collectively, our data show that despite their
different morphological and phenotypic features, SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells exhibited
similar genotypic characteristics. Finally, pangenomic profiling identifies new potential
pathways to be targeted to circumvent AZA-resistance. In conclusion, SKM1-R cells
represent a valuable tool for the validation of new therapeutic intervention in MDS.

INTRODUCTION

[5]. Main prognostic factors of MDS, for progression to
AML and survival, include the number and importance of
the cytopenia, the percentage of marrow blasts and finally
bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities [6]. Those factors
are combined in an International Prognostic Scoring
System that distinguishes 4 subgroups with different risk
of progression to AML and survival (low, intermediate 1
(int-1), intermediate 2 (int-2) and high). Low and int-1
subgroups are often considered together as favorable or
low risk MDS, int-2 and high subgroups are classified as

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal
hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by
ineffective hematopoiesis leading to blood cytopenias,
especially anemia, and often evolving to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) [1]. MDS largely predominate in the
elderly [2-4]. They are classified based on morphology
and blast cell percentage in the blood and the bone marrow

unfavorable or high risk MDS (HR-MDS). IPSS scoring
has been recently revised allowing better stratification of
MDS patients [7].
Aracytine-based chemotherapy yields complete
remission (CR) rates of 50 % in HR-MDS [8], but is
limited to a minority of MDS patients, whose age and
general condition do not preclude such treatment. In
addition, duration of CR is generally short (about 1 year)
and most patients relapse. Lower intensity chemotherapy
regimens, mainly low dose aracytine have been largely
used in elderly MDS patients, with CR and partial
remission (PR) rates of only 20% [9-11]. In addition, these
chemotherapy regimens have poor efficacy in patients
with an unfavourable karyotype [12].
Several consistent studies demonstrated that
increased and aberrant gene hyper-methylation occur
during progression from low to high-risk MDS [13].

Based on the hypothesis that hyper-methylation might
favour leukemogenesis by silencing tumor suppressor
genes, demethylating agents including AZA have been
introduced for the treatment of MDS with the aim to
antagonize this process [14, 15]. Two phase-III studies
demonstrated a survival benefit of AZA over conventional
care regimen [16, 17]. Nevertheless, only 50 to 60% of the
patients respond to AZA and most of responders relapse
within 12 to 15 months. In relapse or refractory patients,
median survival is around 6 months [18]. Therefore new
treatments are urgently needed for these patients. In this
line, several drugs have been tested in those patients, with
so far no demonstrated effect on survival.
To get insight into the mechanisms of AZA
resistance, we generated AZA-resistant SKM-1 cells from
the parental SKM-1 MDS/AML cell line, initially isolated
from a patient with a refractory anemia with an excess

of blasts (RAEB-2) in transformation [19]. We described
herein, the phenotypic and genotypic features of both
SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells. We found that SKM1-R cells
exhibit different morphological and phenotypic features
as compared to SKM1-S cells, with no global genotypic
alterations. Finally, pangenomic profiling of both cell lines
shows preferential modulation of genes involved in cell
migration, death and survival.

exhibited micronuclei, with some cells containing up to
eight of these structures (arrows). Finally, quantitative
flow cytometry analysis of DNA content indicated that less
than 5% of SKM1-S cells were tetraploïd whereas up to
40% of SKM1-R cells exhibited tetraploidy. Importantly,
around 20% of SKM1-R cells had an 8N DNA content
and 8% had a 16N DNA content (Figure 1F). The same
distribution of DNA content was maintained during 96h
of culture. In conclusion, SKM1-R cells were found
to be near tetraploid as compared to their SKM1-S
counterpart, that were hyperdiploid. Besides ploidy, the
global caryotype assessed by conventional cytogenetic
(Figures 2A and 2B) or SNP array analysis of both cell
clones (Figures 2C and 2D) was strictly identical between
SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells. Indeed, no evidence of
cytogenetic abnormalities and no SNP alterations were
found in SKM1-R cells compared to their SKM1-S
counterpart. Most of the time, tetraploidy results from the
endoduplication of an previously haploid karyotype. This
could be indeed the case here, since no other chromosomal
abnormalities arose in the SKM1-S versus SKM1-R

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Phase contrast images of SKM1-S and SKM1-R cell
lines revealed that conversely to SKM1-S cells that grew
individually, SKM1-R cells formed clones containing
several tens of cells (Figures 1A and B). Fluorescence
microscopy experiments confirmed increased size and
ploidy in SKM1-R cells stained with both DAPI (blue)
and phalloïdine to visualize the actin network (red)
(Figure 1E). Electron microscope images also showed
that SKM1-R cells exhibited increased size and ploïdy

clone. The reasons underlying tetraploidy in SKM1-R
cell is currently unknown. We have shown previously that
foretinib, a Polo Like Kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitor induced
polyploidy in an imatinib-resistant K562 cell line via a
caspase-2-dependent mechanism [20]. However, PLK1
was found to be expressed at identical levels in SKM1-S
and SKM1-R cell lines (results not shown). Although
SKM1-R cells have been described previously to exhibit
impaired mitochondrial apoptosis in response to AZA[21],
caspase-2 expression and activity were not affected in
these cells (data not shown). It would be of interest to
determine whether AZA triggers caspase-2 activation in
SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells and whether foretinib is able
to restore cell death in SKM1-R cells.
In addition, long-term incubation of SKM1-S cells

with different concentrations of AZA (up to 96h) failed
to reproduce tetraploidy suggesting that polyploidy
is a feature of AZA-resistant cells but is not a direct
consequence of AZA treatment. Interestingly, increased
ploidy has been already reported in a multiple myeloma
cell line resistant to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
[22]. In this line, the observation that the SKM1-R cell
line is nearly tetraploid could be physiologically relevant.
Indeed, it has been reported earlier that the plasma cells
of patients who developed bortezomib resistance evolved
from hyperdiploidy to tetraploidy [23]. The relationship
between tetraploidy and AZA resistance is not clear
at present but one could speculate that modulation of
gene expression in SKM1-R cells, such as increased
cyclin D1 expression that normally lead to mitotic arrest

and apoptosis in SKM1-S could be overcome in some
SKM1-R cells leading to impaired apoptosis, survival,
amplification and abnormal cytokinesis. It has been
also reported that tetraploidy is a rare event and a poor
pronostic factor in MDS [24]. In line with these findings,
it would be interesting to compare if tetraploidy is more
frequently observed in primary bone marrow cells from
AZA-resistant MDS and AML patients.
A significant advance in the pathogenesis of myeloid
malignancies is the recent discovery of mutations in
gene encoding enzymes involved in the regulation of
DNA conformation [25-27]. We thus sequenced the 14
most frequently mutated genes in MDS to characterize
molecularly our cell lines and to investigate whether
long-term treatment of SKM1-R cells with AZA may
impact on the frequency of such mutations (for the primer
sequences, please refer to sup Table 1). As shown on Table
1, mutations in TP53, TET2 and ASLX1 were detected in
both SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells, whereas expression of

the other genes tested was not affected. We concluded that
AZA does not modify the status of mutations of SKM1
cells. Interestingly, mutations of both TET2 and ASLX1
were found in SKM1 cells, as it is the case in a significant
proportion of MDS and AML patients. Therefore our
SKM1-R cell line represents an excellent cell line model,
to investigate the mechanisms of AZA resistance but to
decipher the functional roles of TET2 and ASXL1 in the
context of MDS.
Finally, to identify genes potentially involved in
the resistance of SKM1-R cells to AZA, we performed
microarray analysis of both SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells
(Figure 3A). Pangenomic profiling revealed up-regulation
of a panel of genes involved in cellular movement, cell
death and survival, cellular compromise, cellular growth
and proliferation (Figure 3B). Our micro-array analysis
also evidenced down-regulation of genes required for cell
to cell signaling and interaction, free radical scavenging
and cellular development in SKM1-R cells (Figure 3C).

genes discriminating the SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells. RNA samples from SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells (in basal condition) were

harvested and expression profiles were determined using pangenomic arrays. Gene expression patterns were determined by the 2-way
hierarchical clustering method using the 422 genes selected for discriminating the SKM1-S and SKM1-R cells. Each square represents the
expression level of a given gene and sample, colors vary from green to red for the lowest to the highest gene expression levels, respectively.
The distance corresponds to a Manhattan distance. Panel B shows the 10 most affected molecular functions in SKM1-R cell. Panel C

Finally, supplemental Table 2 shows the list of the best
89 genes discriminating WT from AZA-resistant SKM1
cells. Among them, 80% were down regulated and 20%
up regulated. This different pattern of gene expression
could be useful to identify and characterize new potential
targetable pathways in MDS and to validate new
therapeutic strategies for myeloid malignancies.

half an hour. After incubation in hypotonic solution for
30 min (0.075 MKCL), cells were fixed with Carnoby’s
solution (3 parts methanol to 1 part glacial acetic acid).
After G-banding, karyotypes were interpreted according
to the 2009 International System for Human Cytogenetic
Nomenclature.

SNP array

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, in 0.1M
Na cacodylate, pH 7.4 for 1 h at 41°C. The pellets were
rinsed in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1
h, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and embedded in
epoxy resin. Oriented 1mm sections were obtained with
diamond knives and multiple areas were thin sectioned,
mounted on copper mesh grids, and stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate. Ultrathin sections were examined
on a Jeol 1200 XII electron microscope.

We performed genome wide single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) analysis using SNP 6.0 arrays
(Affymetrix, High Wycombe, U.K) on SKM1-S and
SKM1-R cell lines. DNA was prepared for hybridization
according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Affymetrix CEL files for each sample were analyzed using
the Genotyping Console software (v3.0.2). Genotyping
was performed using Birdseed V2 algorithm. Unpaired
Copy Number and LOH analysis was performed with
Regional GC correction. Copy number and UPD were also
analyzed using the Copy Number Analyzer for GeneChip
(CNAG version 3.3.0.1) algorithm (http://www.genome.
umin.jp/CNAGtop2.html) [28].

Confocal microscopy

Gene expression analyses

The cells prepared for fluorescence staining were
grown on glass coverslips. They were washed with icecold PBS and were successively fixed and permeabilized
with 1% PFA and PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100,
respectively. Then, the cells were incubated for 1 h with
phalloidin. Finally, the cells were incubated with 1 mg/
ml DAPI, mounted on glass slides in Fluoromount-G
(Southern Biotechnology Associates, 0100-01) and
photographed with a confocal laser microscope (Carl
Zeiss, LSM-510-Meta).

Microarray analyses were performed on the
GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA 95051, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Microarray data are archived in GEO,
and on the MEDIANTE database developed by the
laboratory (Lebrigand and Barbry, bioinformatics 2011).
Normalization was performed using RMA and log2 ratio
was calculated for 1 different contrast: WT NT versus
AZA-R NT. The best discriminating genes were selected
using the following threshold: log2 (intensity) >7 in at
least one experimental condition and log2 (ratio) >2 for at
least one contrast. Hierarchical clustering was done with
the Multi-Experiment Viewer (MeV) program, using a
Manhattan distance metric and average linkage. Biological
theme analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis software™ (IPA™).

Electronic microscopy

Ploidy and cell cycle analysis
After treatment, the cells were washed, fixed in
ethanol 70% and, finally, left overnight at -20°C. Cells
were next incubated in PBS, 3 μg/ml RNase A and 40
μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min at 4°C. Cell
distribution across the different phases of the cell cycle
or DNA content was analyzed with a Miltenyi cytometer
[20].

Gene mutations analysis
TP53 mutation screening was performed using
Sanger sequencing. Exons 5 to 8 of TP53 were amplified
from genomic DNA using the intronic primers indicated
in Supplemental Table 1. The purified PCR products
were sequenced in both directions using the BigDye®
Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Bio-systems,
Foster City, CA) and analyzed on the Applied Biosystems
3730xl Genetic Analyzer. The Seqscape software version
2.7 (Applied Biosystems) was used to detect sequence
variations. Mutations in ASXL1 (exon 12), CBL (exons

Conventional cytogenetic
Cytogenetic analyses were performed on metaphase
cells derived from 24-h unstimulated SKM1-S and
SKM1-R cell lines. Complete karyotyping was done with
a minimum of 20 metaphases analyzed. Briefly, the cells
were synchronized using fluorodeoxyuridine, uridine and
thymidine. Colcemid was added to culture (0.05 g/ml) for
