Abstract
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and CDK6 are frequently
overexpressed or hyperactivated in human cancers. Targeting
CDK4/CDK6 in combination with cytotoxic killing therefore
represents a rational approach to cancer therapy. By selective
inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 with PD 0332991, which leads to early
G1 arrest and synchronous S-phase entry upon release of the G1
block, we have developed a novel strategy to prime acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) cells for cytotoxic killing by cytarabine (Ara-C).
This sensitization is achieved in part through enrichment of
S-phase cells, which maximizes the AML populations for Ara-C
incorporation into replicating DNA to elicit DNA damage.
Moreover, PD 0332991 triggered apoptosis of AML cells through

inhibition of the homeobox (HOX)A9 oncogene expression,
reducing the transcription of its target PIM1. Reduced PIM1
synthesis attenuates PIM1-mediated phosphorylation of the proapoptotic BAD and activates BAD-dependent apoptosis. In vivo,
timely inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 by PD 0332991 and release
profoundly suppresses tumor growth in response to reduced
doses of Ara-C in a xenograft AML model. Collectively, these data
suggest selective and reversible inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 as an
effective means to enhance Ara-C killing of AML cells at reduced
doses, which has implications for the treatment of elderly AML
patients who are unable to tolerate high-dose Ara-C therapy.

Introduction

potent inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 (IC5010 nmol/L for
recombinant proteins; ref. 8). Unlike other CDK inhibitors, at
concentrations speciﬁc for inhibition of CDK4/CDK6, PD
0332991 has little or no activity against at least 38 additional
kinases, including CDK2, due to steric hindrance (8). Providing
the ﬁrst evidence for PD 03329910 s bioactivity in primary cancer
cells, we showed that PD 0332991 inhibited CDK4/CDK6 in
primary human multiple myeloma cells (IC50, 60 nmol/L) in the
presence of bone marrow stromal cells, leading to early G1 arrest
(9). PD 0332991 was similarly effective in inhibiting CDK4/
CDK6 in AML, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), glioblastoma, and
many other cancer types ex vivo (10–12), and suppressed tumor
growth in myeloma, MCL and AML tumor xenografts (8, 9, 11),
and in an immunocompetent mouse myeloma model (13).
Induction of early G1 arrest by PD 0332991 requires retinoblastoma (Rb), the substrate of CDK4 and CDK6, but not p53,
and this is reversible in vitro and in vivo (14). In the ﬁrst-in-human
single-agent phase I clinical trial, PD 0332991 effectively inhibited CDK4/6 and induced early G1 arrest within tolerable doses,
resulting in a favorable clinical response in relapse/refractory MCL
patients (15). When used in combination with letrozole, PD
0332991 more than tripled the progression-free survival of metastatic breast cancer patients treated with letrozole alone in a
phase II clinical trial (16). The selectivity and reversibility of cellcycle inhibition by PD 0332991 and its clinical efﬁcacy suggest a
unique opportunity to target speciﬁc phases of the cell cycle in
cancer.
To advance mechanism-based targeting of CDK4/CDK6 in
AML, we now show that induction of early G1 arrest by PD
0332991 inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 resulted in efﬁcient synchronization of AML cells. After release of PD 0332991-induced early
G1 arrest, AML cells progress synchronously into S-phase, thereby

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute
leukemia in adults, with the median age of 69 years (1). Among
genes that are implicated in the leukemogenesis of AML, high
HOX gene expression has been associated with unfavorable
prognosis, and lower HOXA9 expression correlates with a more
favorable progression-free survival and response to therapy (2–4).
However, despite intensive investigation of the etiology of AML
and recent advances in targeted therapy, the nucleoside analog
cytarabine (Ara-C) remains the ﬁrst-line chemotherapy drug for
AML for the last 40 years. Unfortunately, older patients are
generally intolerant to high-dose Ara-C due to high toxicity and
have few alternative treatment options, thus resulting in dismal
prognosis (5).
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and CDK6 are rarely mutated
but frequently overexpressed or hyperactivated in human cancers
(6, 7). PD 0332991 (palbociclib), a cell permeable pyridopyrimidine with oral bioavailability, is an exceptionally selective and

PD 0332991 Potentiates Ara-C–Mediated AML Therapy

creating a deﬁned time window, during which AML cells are
poised for incorporation of Ara-C. Moreover, sequential PD
0332991 þ Ara-C treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in
cytotoxic killing of AML cells in vivo. At the molecular level,
induction of early G1 arrest by PD 0332991 led to reduced
expression of HOXA9 and the HOXA9-target gene Pim1. This
resulted in a loss of inhibitory phosphorylation of BAD, and
subsequent activation of BAD-mediated apoptosis in response to
Ara-C. Our results suggest that the antitumor activity of PD
0332991 stems from both reversible G1 arrest that sensitizes AML
cells to Ara-C–based therapy, and effective downregulation of
HOXA9 expression that leads to the derepression of a proapoptotic response.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The human AML cell line HL-60 and the U937 histiocytic
lymphoma with monocytic features were obtained from the
ATCC. The cell lines were maintained in RPMI1640 medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 U/mL streptomycin. The human primary CD34þ AML
cells were puriﬁed using MACS CD34 MicroBeads (Miltenyl
Biotec), and cocultured with mitomycin-treated HS-5 human
stromal cells (17). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
isolated using Ficoll Density Centrifugation (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences). Cytarabine (Ara-C) was purchased from Sigma. PD
0332991 was obtained from Pﬁzer.
Cell-cycle analysis
HL-60 cells were incubated with PD 0332991, or PBS (vehicle
control) for the indicated periods of time. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 5 mg/mL; Sigma) was added to AML cells for 30
minutes and centrifuged. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS
and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol. BrdUrd uptake was measured by ﬂow
cytometry as described (17, 18), using a FITC-anti-BrdUrd (Roche
Diagnostics) monoclonal antibody. Subsequently, cells were
stained with 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) and
0.1% RNase (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at room temperature,
and subjected to analysis by ﬂow cytometry.
Western blot analysis
HL-60 cells (1.0  106) were lysed in 0.5 mL of modiﬁed
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1
mmol/L Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)]. The lysates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and
resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane, blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween
20, and 5% BSA, and probed with a primary antibody overnight at
4 C. Subsequently, the blot was washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween
20, and speciﬁc antibody binding was detected with a horseradish
peroxidase–coupled secondary antibody, followed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) and exposure to ﬁlm.
For immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used:
b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RB, phospho-RB (Ser 807/
811), BAD, HOXA9 (Cell Signaling Technology).
Cell apoptosis and viability
Apoptotic and dead cells were analyzed by staining the cells
with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (33 nmol/L; Invitrogen) to detect

mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Live cells were
determined by Trypan blue exclusion in triplicate.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
The ﬁrst-strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total
RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
cDNA products were quantitated using the SYBR green ﬂuorescence reagent on the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection
System. Cycle threshold results were normalized to b-actin gene
expression.
Establishment of myeloid leukemia xenografts and therapy
A total of 500 HL-60 cells stably expressing the HSV-TK-eGFPluciferase fusion protein were injected via the lateral tail vein into
NOD/SCI/IL-2Rg mice. The tumor distribution was followed by
serial whole-body noninvasive imaging of visible light emitted by
luciferase-expressing HL-60 cells upon injection of mice with
luciferin. Seven days after tumor injection, the NOD/SCID/IL2Rg
mice with established myeloid leukemia were divided into four
groups. PD 0332991 was dissolved in vehicle (50 mmol/L sodium
lactate, pH 4.0) and was given daily by gavage at 150 mg/kg for
days indicated. Ara-C (1.6 or 10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally as indicated. The control mice received the vehicle
through the same route and on the same schedule. Survival times
were compared with Kaplan–Meier survival analysis.
Ectopic expression of human HOXA9
To express human HOXA9, the HOXA9 retroviruses were
produced by cotransfecting 293T cells with the PINCO-HOXA9
plasmid and the pAmpho and pQE plasmids (19). The PINCO
retroviral vector was used as the control retrovirus. HL-60 cells
were spin-infected with viral supernatants at 2,000 rpm for 2
hours at room temperature.
shRNA knockdown
To knockdown BAD, the pKLO.1 vector carrying BAD or the
GFP control shRNA (Sigma) was cotransfected with pVSVG and
Delta-8.9 plasmids into 293T cells to generate the desired shRNA
lentivirus (17). Knockdown of each target was validated by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting at
72 hours after transduction.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis of the in vitro data, the Student t test was
used. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine the effect of
treatment on the survival of the mice.

Results
Cell-cycle synchronization of AML cells by PD 0332991
Ara-C is a deoxynucleoside analog that is incorporated into
replicating DNA only during the S-phase of the cell cycle. We posit
that strategies to enrich asynchronously growing AML cells in Sphase will maximize the AML population poised for Ara-C incorporation, thereby increasing the efﬁciency of cytotoxic killing at a
reduced Ara-C dose. To this end, PD 0332991 has been shown to
be a selective and potent inhibitor for CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and
in vivo in animal models, and in a clinical trial of recurrent MCL
(9–13, 15). We ﬁrst assessed the impact of PD 0332991-dependent cell-cycle inhibition on enhancement of Ara-C cytotoxicity in

fresh primary AML patient cells. These fresh CD34þ AML cells
were still engaging in active cell cycle, as determined by BrdUrd
uptake by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1). These patient
CD34þ AML cells were ﬁrst treated with 0.5 mmol/L or 1 mmol/L
PD 0332991 for 24 hours, followed by wash off and culturing for
24 hours to allow synchronized S-phase entry. A total of 5 mmol/L
Ara-C was administered and cell viability was determined by
Trypan blue staining 24 hours post-Ara-C. As shown in Fig. 1A,
pretreatment with PD 0332991 for 24 hours resulted in induction
of cell death in approximately 50% of primary AML cells after AraC administration. In comparison, only 17% AML cells lost viability without cell-cycle synchronization when PD 0332991 and
Ara-C were simultaneous administrated (Fig. 1A, left).
On this basis, we investigated the mechanisms by which
sequential PD 0332991 and Ara-C administration enhances cytotoxic killing of AML cells using AML cell lines that are more readily
available and amenable to genetic interrogations. We posit that
induction of early G1 arrest by PD 0332991 followed by synchronous S-phase entry upon release of the G1 block would allow
more AML cells to incorporate Ara-C than those of asynchronously growing cells, thereby enhancing the efﬁciency of cytotoxic
killing (Fig. 1B). The human HL-60 AML cells were cultured in the
presence of 0.5 mmol/L PD 0332991 or the DMSO vehicle. PD
0332991 completely inhibited CDK4/CDK6 within 24 hours, as
indicated by the loss of CDK4/CDK6-speciﬁc phosphorylation of
Rb on serine807–811 (pRb), arrested the cell cycle in G1, and
marked reduction of DNA replication as measured by BrdUrd
pulse labeling (Fig. 1C and E). After washout of PD 0332991 from
the medium, HL-60 cells began to enter S-phase by 4 hours, with
concomitant increase in pRb. By 8 hours, the majority of HL-60
cells were progressing into S-phase (Fig. 1C and E). Similar results
were obtained in the U937 histiocytic lymphoma with acute
monocytic leukemia morphology in response to PD 0332991
treatment and release (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, PD
0332991 effectively arrested AML cells in early G1, and synchronized them in S-phase after PD 0332991 withdrawal.

Cell-cycle synchronization by PD 0332991 enhances Ara-C
killing of AML cells
Ara-C is converted to cytosine arabinoside triphosphate by
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and to a lesser extent, by deoxyguanosine kinase, which elicits cytotoxicity when incorporated into
replicating DNA in S-phase through termination of DNA strand
elongation (20, 21). To determine whether S-phase synchronization sensitizes AML cells to Ara-C, HL-60 cells were arrested in
G1 by PD 0332991, and then released to fresh medium to allow
synchronized entry into S-phase. Ara-C was administered at 8
hours after removal of PD 0332991 when maximal S-phase
enrichment was achieved, and induction of apoptotic cell death
was determined by the MitoTracker assay that measures the

807/811 (pRb) as an indication of induction of early G1 arrest 24 hours post-PD
0332991. Release of PD 0332991 arrest and S-phase entry was marked by
rephosphorylation Rb. pRb and overall Rb levels were detected by
immunoblotting at the indicated time points by the anti-phospho-Rb and
anti-Rb antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). b-Actin was also measured as
the loading control. F, HL-60 cells were arrested in early G1 by PD 0332991 for
24 hours and released synchronously into S-phase for 8 hours. Ara-C was
added at the indicated doses for 48 hours, and cell viability was determined
by Trypan blue staining. These data are representative of three independent
experiments; error bars, SD.  , P < 0.05.

permeabilization of mitochondrial outer membrane. The asynchronously growing HL-60 cells were similarly treated with Ara-C
as a control. By 4 hours of Ara-C treatment, 22.3% of S-phase–
synchronized HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis—a 3.5-fold
increase in apoptotic cells was determined over the asynchronous
cells (6.4%; Fig. 1D). Similar enhancement of apoptosis upon PD
0332991 synchronization was observed in U937 cells in response
to Ara-C (Supplementary Fig. S2). This led to a further 20%
reduction of viability in the S-phase–synchronized HL60 cells
compared with that of the asynchronous HL60 cells at low dose
(10 nmol/L) Ara-C treatment (Fig. 1F). Together, these data
indicate that S-phase synchronization upon PD 0332991 arrest
and release markedly enhances Ara-C–mediated cytotoxic killing
of AML cells.
Reversible CDK4/CDK6 inhibition by PD 0332991 enhanced
tumor suppression by Ara-C
We next evaluated the antitumor effect of sequential PD
0332991 and Ara-C administration in disseminated AML xenografts in NOD/SCID/IL2Rg (NSG) mice. Previously, we have
shown that cell-cycle synchronization in vivo can be achieved by
timely administration of PD 0332991 that induced G1 arrest,
followed by discontinuation of PD 0332991 to allow S-phase
entry (14).
In this AML xenograft model, a total of 500 HL-60 cells stably
expressing the HSV-TK-eGFP-luciferase transgenes (HL-60LUCþ) were injected via tail vein into NSG mice (5 groups,
5 mice per group) for induction of disseminated tumors, which
were monitored by serial noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI). PD 0332991 (150 mg/kg) was administered daily by
gavage on days 6 to 4 after tumor induction to arrest cell
cycle in G1. After 4 days of PD 0332991 withdrawal, which we
previously determined to achieve maximal S-phase entry (14),
Ara-C was administered intraperitoneally at low dose (1.6 mg/
kg) or high dose (10 mg/kg) daily for 3 consecutive days.
Tumor load was measured by BLI weekly between day 2 and
day 23 (Fig. 2A). As a control, NSG mice with HL-60-LUCþ
xenografts were treated with either PD 0332991 or Ara-C alone
at low or high dose in parallel. Disseminated tumors developed
by 14 days following the injection of HL-60-LUCþ cells (Fig. 2B
and C).
A single regimen of Ara-C at a low or high dose had little or only
marginal effect on the tumor load, whereas PD 0332991 alone
initially suppressed the tumor growth (day 9), but was unable to
sustain the inhibitory effect (days 16–23). Strikingly, the sequential PD 0332991-Ara-C treatment marked reduced tumor load at
all time points compared with the control groups (Fig. 2B).
Notably, inhibition of tumor development by Ara-C at low dose
(1.6 mg/kg) in PD 0332991-synchronized HL-60-LUCþ xenografts was 9 times greater on day 9 and 16 times greater on day 16
than in asynchronous HL-60-LUCþ xenografts (Fig. 2B and C).
Although the PD 0332991-high Ara-C dose regimen decreased the
tumor load further (Fig. 2B, compare the 3rd and 6th groups
and Fig. 2C), mortality occurred, as did the single high-dose Ara-C
treatment (Fig. 2D). In comparison, none of the mice treated with
the combined PD 0332991–low-dose Ara-C regimen succumbed
to death while on therapy, demonstrating improved survival over
other treatment groups (Fig. 2B–D). Together, these results indicate that PD 0332991 synchronization markedly enhances the
killing of AML cells at a signiﬁcantly reduced Ara-C dose that was
otherwise ineffective.

Cell-cycle–coupled regulation of HOXA9 expression mediates
Ara-C killing
Dysregulation of the leukemogenic HOXA9 oncoprotein is
frequently observed in AML and is associated with poor prognosis
and therapy response (2–4). To elucidate the mechanisms that
underlie cell-cycle enhancement of Ara-C killing, we investigated
the PD 0332991 response of HOXA9. In prolonged early G1 arrest
induced by 24 hours of PD 0332991 treatment, there was a sharp
decline of both the mRNA and protein levels of HOXA9 (Fig. 3A
and B), which coincided with dephosphorylation of RB (Fig. 1E).
The HOXA9 mRNA levels began to recover at 8 hours after the
release of the G1 block when the majority of HL-60 cells were

entering S-phase, peaked at 12 hours (S–G2), and declined as cells
entered the next G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3A, compare
with Fig. 1A; Fig. 1E). The HOXA9 protein levels also began to
recover at 8–12 hours after PD 0332991 removal in middle-late Sphase, which paralleled that of HOXA9 mRNA (Fig. 3B). However, even with the HOXA9 mRNA levels declining sharply
between 12 and 24 hours, the HOXA9 protein continued to
increase in G2–M, reaching the pretreatment level as cells entered
the next G1 phase of cell cycle (Fig. 3B and 1A). These data
indicated that the expression of HOXA9 mRNA, but not protein,
is coupled to the cell cycle: low in G1 and G1–S transition, elevated
in S-phase, and declined as the cells entered G2–M. The basis for
the uncoupling of HOXA9 mRNA and protein expressed is currently unknown, but induction of prolonged early G1 arrest likely
led to perturbation of translational, posttranslational modiﬁcation, or degradation pathways that governs the steady state levels
of HOXA9 protein.
This led us to investigate whether the PD 0332991-mediated
uncoupling of HOXA9 protein expression in S-phase contributes to
enhanced Ara-C killing. HL-60 cells were infected with a recombinant PINCO-HOXA9 retrovirus to establish stable cell lines in
which ectopic expression of HOXA9 did not ﬂuctuate during the
cell cycle (Fig. 3C). Despite the striking cell-cycle dependence of
endogenous HOXA9 mRNA expression, and the ability of HOXA9

1842 Cancer Res; 75(9) May 1, 2015

to stimulate proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells (22–
24), enforced expression of HOXA9 did not affect the kinetics of PD
0332991-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest or the subsequent S-phase
entry upon release of PD 0332991 (Fig. 3D).
HOXA9 is also known to have antiapoptotic activity (25). We
therefore posit that the reduction of HOXA9 protein levels by prior
PD 0332991-induced G1 arrest may inﬂuence the survival of
synchronized HL-60 cells in response to Ara-C. Indeed, enforced
expression of HOXA9 dramatically inhibited Ara-C–induced apoptosis, as determined by the reduction of mitochondrial permeabilization in Ara-C–treated HL-60 cells, more pronounced in PD
0332991 synchronized cells than in the absence of PD 0332991
synchronization (Fig. 3E). These results are consistent with an
antiapoptotic role of HOXA9 (25). Importantly, they revealed that
PD 0332991 synchronization not only ampliﬁes the DNA damage
by maximizing Ara-C incorporation into replicating DNA, but also
compromises the antiapoptotic capacity of HOXA9 by delaying the
restoration of HOXA9 protein expression during S-phase.

PD 0332991 Potentiates Ara-C–Mediated AML Therapy

contributes to the sensitization of AML
cells to apoptotic induction and Ara-C

turn, Pim1 phosphorylates the proapoptotic protein BAD on
Serine112, which inactivates BAD and attenuation BAD-mediated
apoptosis (25). The PIM1 mRNA was reduced approximately
60%, in parallel with the reduction of HOXA9 mRNA and protein
expression following prolonged early G1 arrest induced by PD
0332991 treatment for 24 hours (Fig. 4A). Ectopic expression of
HOXA9 in HL-60 cells effectively prevented the reduction of PIM1
mRNA in PD 0332991-induced G1-arrested cells, consistant with
PIM1 being a direct transcriptional target of HOXA9 (Fig. 4A;
ref. 25). Knocking down BAD expression by shRNA, markedly
increased the resistance of HL-60 cells to apoptosis induced by the
PD 0332991–Ara-C combination therapy (Fig. 4B–E). Notably,
the shGFP-expressing HL60 cells exhibited high basal level rates of
apoptosis (15%) compared with the native HL60 cells (5%) under
normal growth conditions (compare Figs. 4D and 1D), and the
fold-increase of Ara-C–induced apoptosis was less pronounced
upon exposure to Ara-C. Nevertheless, the survival of these PD
0332991-synchronized shGFP-HL60 cells was markedly reduced
after Ara-C treatment. Together, these results provide compelling
evidence that PD 0332991-induced sensitization of AML cells to
Ara-C cytotoxicity is mediated, at least in part, by the reduction of
HOXA9 and its transcriptional target PIM1, thereby enhancing the
proapoptotic effect of BAD.

Discussion
The CDK4/CDK6-speciﬁc inhibitor PD 0332991 (palbociclib)
is under intense investigation for its clinical efﬁcacy in cell-cycle
control and enhancing tumoricidal activity in combination therapy (9, 12, 14, 15, 26, 27). This study took advantage of the
reversibility of PD 0332991 inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 to
synchronize AML cells in S-phase to maximize the percentage of
AML cells poised for incorporating Ara-C into replicating DNA at a
deﬁned time point, thereby potentiating the tumoricidal activity
of Ara-C. It is noteworthy that high-dose Ara-C in combination
with anthracyclines remains the major induction chemotherapy
for AML patients below 60 years of age (5). However, the median
ages of the majority of AML patients at the time of diagnosis are
typically between 65 and 70 years when they are less tolerant of
the toxic effect of the intensive Ara-C regimen. As such, there is an
urgent unmet need to develop novel therapies that effectively
manage the leukemic disease for elderly AML patients.
Our studies demonstrated that PD 0332991-mediated enrichment of AML cells at the S-phase markedly enhances cytotoxic
killing of AML cells at much reduced doses of Ara-C (Fig. 5). PD
0332991-synchronized HL-60 xenograft mice responded favorably to low dose Ara-C (1.6 mg/kg) in reducing tumor load and

displayed overall improved survival (Fig. 2). The increased mortality in mice treated with high dose Ara-C (10 mg/kg), with or
without PD 0332991 synchronization, further highlights the
beneﬁt of cell-cycle synchronization by PD 0332991 that markedly enhanced the tumoricidal effect of Ara-C at signiﬁcantly
reduced doses. These ﬁndings implicate that cell-cycle sensitization with PD 0332991 in combination with reduced dose of Ara-C
may improve the treatment outcomes of AML patients who are
otherwise ineligible to the current high-dose Ara-C regimen.
Sensitization of AML cells to Ara-C by PD 0332991 treatment
likely results from alterations of multiple cellular signaling pathways, such as the DNA damage response and survival pathways that
are secondary to induction of prolonged early G1 arrest. First,
induction of prolonged early G1 arrest and sensitization of cancer
cells to cytotoxic killing by PD 0332991 is due to inhibition of
CDK4/CDK6 as it absolutely requires Rb, the substrate of CDK4 and
CDK6, and was recapitulated by silencing both CDK4 and CDK6
(14, 27). Second, induction of prolonged early G1 by PD 0332991
sensitizes cancer cells to cytotoxic killing by a partner agent by
forcing an imbalance in genes expression. In prolonged early G1
arrest that exceeds the early G1 transit time by PD 0332991 inhibition of CDK4/CDK6, only genes programmed for early G1, and
not other cell-cycle phase are expressed, and the cell-cycle–coupled
gene expression is incompletely restored upon release from the G1
block (14). Consistent with reprogramming of cancer cells for
cytotoxic killing by induction of prolonged early G1 arrest, PD
0332991 treatment alone (for 21 days) resulted in tumor regression
and durable complete and partial responses in some recurrent MCL
patients in the ﬁrst single-agent phase I clinical trial (15).
At the mechanistic level, we observed a striking downregulation
of the leukemogenic HOXA9 oncogene as one such response of
AML cells to PD 0332991 treatment. Our studies established
HOXA9 as a cell-cycle–coupled gene, with increased mRNA
expression in S-phase over other cell-cycle phases. Surprisingly,
while the HOXA9 protein level paralleled that of the mRNA level
in G1 and S-phase albeit with a delay, it did not follow the
reduction of mRNA as cells exit S-phase. It is possible that the
prolonged early G1 arrest induced by PD 0332991 altered the
translational efﬁciency of HOXA9 or the posttranslational modiﬁcation pathways that rendered HOXA9 refractory to degrada-

tion post-S-phase. Future studies will be required to determine the
basis for the delay in restoration of HOXA9 protein in S-phase
synchronization following prolonged early G1 arrest. However,
the delay in HOXA9 expression apparently contributes to cellcycle sensitization to Ara-C killing.
Suppression of HOXA9 expression led to concomitant reduction
of expression of the HOXA9-target Pim1 gene, and the subsequent
derepression of phosphorylation of BAD, resulting in promotion of
apoptosis. Indeed, enforced expression of HOXA9 restored Pim1
expression and attenuated the Ara-C–induced death of AML cells.
Brumatti and colleagues recently reported that HOXA9 is also
required to maintain the expression of BCL2, which is critical for
the leukemogenic activity of HOXA9 in myeloid progenitors (28),
although it is yet unclear whether HOXA9 acts directly on the
transcription of BCL2, as seen with Pim1. HOXA9 appears essential
for survival of HL60 cells, as silencing of HOXA9 by lentiviral shRNA
led to massive cell death (Chen and Zhou, unpublished data). This
precludes a direct assessment of how reduced HOXA9 expression
may affect Ara-C–induced cell death. It is noteworthy that HL-60
cells with enforced expression of HOXA9 were not fully refractory to
Ara-C, and prolonged treatment of Ara-C resulted in loss of viability,
suggesting that the combined PD 0332991–Ara-C therapy disabled
other survival mechanisms required for drug resistance. Future
genome-wide interrogations of cellular pathways such as RNAi
knockdown or enforced expression of cDNA libraries in AML cells
will likely discover these new cellular pathways and targets that aid
the design of more effective therapeutic strategies for AML.
