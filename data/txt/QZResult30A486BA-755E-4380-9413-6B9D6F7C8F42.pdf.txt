Abstract
Recurrent glioblastomas (rGBM) invariably relapse after initial response to anti-VEGF therapy. There are 2
prevailing hypotheses on how these tumors escape antiangiogenic therapy: switch to VEGF-independent
angiogenic pathways and vessel co-option. However, direct evidence in rGBM patients is lacking. Thus, we
compared molecular, cellular, and vascular parameters in autopsy tissues from 5 rGBM patients who had been
treated with the pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor cediranib versus 7 patients who received no
therapy or chemoradiation but no antiangiogenic agents. After cediranib treatment, endothelial proliferation
and glomeruloid vessels were decreased, and vessel diameters and perimeters were reduced to levels comparable
to the unaffected contralateral brain hemisphere. In addition, tumor endothelial cells expressed molecular
markers specific to the blood–brain barrier, indicative of a lack of revascularization despite the discontinuation
of therapy. Surprisingly, in cediranib-treated GBM, cellular density in the central area of the tumor was lower
than in control cases and gradually decreased toward the infiltrating edge, indicative of a change in growth
pattern of rGBMs after cediranib treatment, unlike that after chemoradiation. Finally, cediranib-treated GBMs
showed high levels of PDGF-C (platelet-derived growth factor C) and c-Met expression and infiltration by
myeloid cells, which may potentially contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. In summary, we show that
rGBMs switch their growth pattern after anti-VEGF therapy—characterized by lower tumor cellularity in the
central area, decreased pseudopalisading necrosis, and blood vessels with normal molecular expression and
morphology—without a second wave of angiogenesis. Cancer Res; 71(1); 19–28. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Abundant angiogenesis with microvascular proliferation
and tumor necrosis caused by severe hypoxia are diagnostic
criteria for glioblastoma (GBM; refs. 1–4). GBM vessels are
glomeruloid, dilated, and tortuous, with abnormalities in
pericyte coverage and basement membrane, which leads to
abnormal vascular function (e.g., increased permeability; refs.

2, 5–7). GBM angiogenesis is driven mainly by VEGF-A
(referred to as VEGF here onward) signaling via its tyrosine
kinase receptor VEGFR2/KDR (8–10). Blockade of VEGF with
bevacizumab (a VEGF-specific antibody; Genentech) or of
VEGF receptors with the pan-VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
cediranib (AstraZeneca) was associated with rates of objective
radiographic responses in phase II trials in patients with
recurrent GBM (rGBM; refs. 11, 12).
In both preclinical and clinical settings, the benefits of
cediranib monotherapy for gliomas are typically transient
and followed by an apparent increase in tumor burden (11,
13). In addition, imaging studies suggest that GBM progression may not be visible on contrast-enhanced MRI (14, 15).
Moreover, preclinical studies suggest a "wave" of tumor
revascularization after discontinuation of anti-VEGF therapy,
which might accelerate tumor relapse (16, 17).
To gain insight into the changes that occur in rGBMs after
anti-VEGF therapy, we analyzed brain tissues obtained at
autopsy. We studied the central area versus the infiltrating edge
of rGBM tissues from patients treated with cediranib at recurrence after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. As a control,
we studied in a similar manner the autopsy tissues from a group
of rGBM patients who received either no treatment or surgery
and/or chemo- and radiotherapy. In addition, we explored the

changes in molecular, cellular, morphologic profiles, and microenvironmental factors that might be responsible for diffuse
infiltrating behavior and resistance to cediranib therapy.

Materials and Methods
Tissue specimens
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 5
patients with rGBM—enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of
cediranib (11, 13)—underwent postmortem examination.
These samples were compared with (i) the initial diagnostic
paraffin blocks (available from 4/5 rGBM patients) prior to
cediranib therapy and (ii) 7 autopsy samples from GBM
patients who had received either no treatment (n ¼ 1) or
chemo- and radiation therapy (n ¼ 6). All samples were
obtained from the Neuropathology Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital after obtaining informed consent and
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.
Histologic analysis
For all analyses, tissues were selected to contain macroscopically identifiable rGBM and its infiltrative edge in the
same block. These FFPE samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In this study, the end of the block
(section) that contains tumor with no recognizable normal
intervening brain structure is referred to as the "central area"
and the "infiltrative area" is the opposite end of the block and
includes identifiable brain structures and infiltrating glioma.
Each autopsy (average 20 blocks per case) was reviewed by 2
neuropathologists (M.S., P.K.A.) to ensure that blocks selected
for the study are morphologically representative of the entire
tumor. Samples were stained with standard H&E. The entire
H&E slide was scanned using a Scanscope scanner (Aperio
Technologies). Regions of interest were selected at the interface of tumor center and infiltrative edge. Cellular density was
estimated as the fraction of surface area occupied by tumor
nuclei (highlighted by hematoxylin) in the central and the
infiltrative regions using an in-house threshold-based segmentation of the nuclei in H&E images using Matlab software (The
MathWorks). Foci of pseudopalisading necrosis, that is, dense
accumulation of tumor nuclei surrounding foci of necrosis
and used as diagnostic criteria of glioblastoma by WHO
classification (18) were counted in 30 high-power fields
(400 magnification) in the central area of the tumor.
Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, and FISH
analyses
Five micrometer thick FFPE sections were immunostained
following manufacturers’ recommendations and standard
protocols with antibodies against the following antigens:
CD31, Ki67 (both prediluted), collagen IV (1:300), and transferrin receptor (CD71, 1:100; all Dako); aSMA (1:100; Sigma);
VEGFR2 (1:250), platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) a (1:100), and PDGFRb (1:100; all Cell Signaling);
CD68 (1:100; Thermo Fischer Scientific); nestin (Abcam;
1:500), SDF1a (1:40; Biovision); CXCR4 (1:200) and PDGF-C
(1:100; R&D Systems); and MDR1 (1:40; Abcam). For detection
of apoptosis, we used the ApopTag kit (Millipore) following

20

manufacturer's instructions. Double immunofluorescence (IF)
staining was performed for nestin with CD34 (Abcam; EP373Y;
dilution 1:100) and for PDGFRb (Cell Signaling; 3169; dilution
1:100) with CD34 (Becton Dickinson; clone MY10; dilution
1:50). Following secondary antibodies were used: Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse [Invitrogen; Alexa Fluor 647 (AF-647);
dilution 1:50] for nestin, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Vector FI-1000; dilution 1:50) for
CD34, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Vector FI-1000; dilution 1:50) for PDGFRb and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse
(AF-647; dilution 1:50) for CD34. Slides were hybridized with
EGFR probe according to a standard FISH protocol.
Semiquantitative analysis of all immunohistochemical
stains was performed by 2 investigators (E.d.T. and M.S.)
who independently scored the intensity of staining of all
proteins in tumor cells and endothelial cells using a scale
from 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining). Microvessel density,
diameter, perimeter, and the surface covered by the vascular
space was estimated in at least 5 random fields of central or
infiltrative area or normal tissue on CD31-stained sections
using a customized analysis software tool compatible with
ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/; 100 vessels at 200 magnification per section). PDGFRb expression in endothelial cells
was evaluated to detect the "ectopic" expression of this marker
in endothelial cells of GBM or other cancers (13, 19). Collagen
IV labeling was used to quantify the basement membrane
thickness (which is abnormally thick in GBMs; ref. 6) using a
segmentation algorithm (Matlab). The profile around the
vessels was fit to an exponential decay function (1):
F ¼ A½e  ðx=LÞ þ C

ðAÞ

where F is the fraction of collagen IV positive area at x distance
(1–10 mm) from the vessels; L is the characteristic length that
correlates with basement membrane thickness. A total of
1,000 cells counted in the areas of the highest Ki-67 expression
or apoptosis; and indices were calculated as a percentage of
positive cells.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SEM. The principal statistical
test was the t test (2-tailed with unequal variance). We
considered a value of P < 0.05 to be statistically significant.

Results
Patient characteristics and response to cediranib
treatment
All 5 rGBM patients studied received cediranib (starting
dose of 45 mg/kg/d) for at least 2 cycles (range: 56–232 days).
Cediranib showed some radiographic activity in all of these
patients: 4 showed partial response (P1, P2, P4, and P5) and 1 a
stable disease (P3) based on MRI performed at 28 days (Table 1
and Supplementary Fig. S1). At the "end-of-study" MRI scan
when compared with day 28 MRI, 2 patients showed stable
disease by imaging but were progressing clinically (P1 and P4),
2 patients (P2 and P5) showed increased tumor volume by T1
post–contrast MRI, and 3 patients (P1, P2, and P4) showed
significantly increased FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion

Supplementary Fig. S1). Four of the 5 patients received no
other treatment after cediranib discontinuation. One patient
(P2) received further anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab
(3 cycles) and CPT-11 (irinotecan; 1 cycle). Examination of the
specimen from this patient showed a similar pattern to the
other 4, thus data from all 5 patients are presented. The 5
rGBM patients had a total survival of 161, 259, 175, 186, and
226 days, respectively, measured from the time of the first
cediranib dose. Of interest, the median overall survival (OS) for
the 31 patients enrolled in the phase 2 study was 227 days
(177–293 days; ref. 11). Clinicopathologic data of control cases
are summarized in Table 2.
Cediranib-treated rGBMs contain structurally normal
brain vessels
The analysis of rGBM autopsy specimens offered several
lines of evidence that rGBM vessels in cediranib-treated
patients resembled the normal brain vessels. First, microvascular proliferation and glomeruloid vessels, which are

diagnostic features of GBM, were virtually undetectable in
autopsy tissues from the patients treated with cediranib
(Figs. 1 and 2). As expected, these features were abundantly
present in all initial biopsies prior to cediranib therapy in
study subjects as well as in control autopsies. Second,
the diameter and perimeter of the rGBM vessels in central
areas of the tumors were significantly lower in cediranibtreated autopsy specimens compared with control specimens (P < 0.05; Fig. 1) as well as those from the patient's
initial diagnostic GBM biopsy sample (data not shown). The
diameter and perimeter of the vessels in the infiltrative edge
of GBMs were comparable between the 2 groups and close to
those of vessels of the normal uninvolved brain (Fig. 1).
Third, the thickness of basement membrane components—
as defined by collagen IV immunostaining—was also significantly reduced in the central areas of the cediranib
treated compared with control patients (P < 0.05; Fig. 1).
Overall, central areas of control cases show broad variability
of vascular parameters. In contrast, tumor vascular parameters in cediranib-treated patients are relatively uniform.

quantification of vessel perimeters
and diameters in central and
infiltrative areas of tumor as well
as normal brain tissue in control
patients or after cediranib by
CD31 immunohistochemistry
shows broad variability in central
areas of control cases and a
narrower spectrum after cediranib
treatment. Cediranib-treated
tumor vessels have a significantly
smaller average perimeter and
diameter in the central area (P ¼
0.02), very close to that of normal
brain capillaries. Quantification of
microvascular density shows that
cediranib-treated tumors have a
similar microvascular density in
the central and infiltrating areas
and that these are similar to the
microvascular density of
uninvolved brain. Microvascular
density of control cases has a
broader variation in the central and

(endothelium unstained, red

Collectively, these morphometric analyses indicate that
vessels within cediranib-treated tumors lack characteristics
of abnormal GBM vasculature despite cessation of the antiangiogenic treatment.

Cediranib treatment decreases cellular density of rGBM
The rGBMs of patients who had not undergone antiangiogenic therapy showed marked variability in nuclear density
within the central area ranging between 2 and 12  103 nuclei/
mm2. The cellular density in the central area of GBMs in
cediranib-treated patients was lower and ranged between 2
and 5  103 cells/mm2; however, this did not reach statistical
significance. In the control cases, the density decreased sharply
with transition into the infiltrative area that showed narrower
range of cell density. In contrast, the cediranib-treated patients
showed cellular densities in the infiltrative edge that were
relatively similar to those in the central area (Fig. 2). Within
1 mm around the tumor edge (0.5 mm), mean nuclear density
in control cases rapidly dropped from 5,301  979 to 2,838 
404 nuclei/mm2 whereas mean nuclear density of cediranibtreated cases was 3,202  302 nuclei/mm2 in the central area
compared with 2,326  271 nuclei/mm2 in the infiltrating edge
(Fig. 2). Interestingly, one patient with the longest interval
between the last dose of cediranib and death (P5; 105 days) has
the cellular density curve pattern similar to the control cases
whereas patients with shorter interval between the last dose of
cediranib and death (P1, P3, and P4; 27, 16, and 42 days,
respectively) and the patient who received bevacizumab until
his death (P2) showed relatively flat curves.
There was no difference in proliferation or apoptosis both
in the central area and infiltrating edge between cediranibtreated and control GBMs (Fig. 2). Control cases showed
significantly higher number of foci with classical pseudopalisading necrosis than cediranib-treated cases (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2). Therefore, anti-VEGF therapy seems to decrease
cellular density in the central area but not the infiltrative
edge. Because the proliferation and apoptosis rates and
necrosis are not increased after cediranib therapy, this indicates either increased infiltration into the normal brain or that
cediranib had direct antitumor effect leading to decrease of
cellular density, which was not restored after discontinuation
of the treatment.
Molecular changes in endothelial cells in cediranibtreated rGBM
In 4 of 5 cediranib-treated autopsy specimens, PDGFRa and
PDGFRb became undetectable in endothelial cells and in 1
case, PDGFRb expression was detectable only in a fraction of
endothelial cells in the central area (Fig. 1D). Specificity of
PDGFRb expression by endothelial cells was confirmed by
double immunohistochemical staining and double immunofluorescent staining using the endothelial markers CD31 and
CD34, respectively, and FISH for EGFR in GBM cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, VEGFR2 immunoreactivity
decreased from a staining intensity of the 3þ (scored in the
original biopsies) to an intensity of 1þ (data not shown). All
control specimens displayed a strong expression of all 3 receptors. Of particular interest, these changes in endothelial phenotype were accompanied by CD71 expression [transferrin
receptor, a marker of a functional blood–brain barrier (BBB)]
supporting the decreased permeability detected by functional
MRI. As expected in the control specimens, CD71 was greatly
reduced in the central area of the tumor. Vessel maturation

24

markers—angiopoietin 2 and Tie2—were quantified and found
to be generally expressed by the endothelial cells in vessels in
central and infiltrative areas and to a lesser extent in the normal
brain tissue in both cediranib-treated and control specimen.
Expression of MDR, a marker of multidrug resistance, was not
changed after cediranib therapy (Supplementary Table S1).
Cediranib-treated GBMs show high levels of PDGF-C,
c-Met, and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells
Although the number of CD68þ tumor-infiltrating myeloid
cells in the infiltrating edge was comparable between control
and cediraninb-treated rGBMs, 2 of 5 cediranib-treated
patients showed high numbers of CD68þ cells in the central
area of the tumor (P1 and P3; Fig. 3A and B). The rGBMs of
these 2 patients progressed rapidly and led to rapid death.
Cediranib-treated and control tumor cells showed no difference in expression of SDF1a or CXCR4 in the central or
infiltrating areas (Fig. 3C). However, in cediranib-treated
tumors, CXCR4 strongly positive myeloid cells were distributed in the similar pattern as CD68þ cells (Fig. 3D).
In addition, in the rGBMs from cediranib-treated patients,
PDGF-C was expressed at variable levels in all cases examined,
both in initial biopsy and autopsy samples. PDGF-C was
focally expressed also in control cases without cediranib
therapy. Finally, c-Met expression was detectable in all the
rGBM specimens examined. Both tumor cells in the central
area of cediranib-treated patients as well as infiltrating cells
showed expression of c-Met (Fig. 4A). A trend toward higher
level of expression of c-Met and higher number of positive
cells was observed for the cediranib-treated specimens when
compared with the control specimens, consistent with the
potential role of the HGF/c-Met pathway in glioma progression (20). Finally, we measured the expression of the developmental intermediate filament, nestin. Tumor cells and
endothelial cells in the central areas were similarly positive
for nestin in cediranib-treated and untreated tumors. Interestingly, endothelial cells in the contralateral, uninvolved part
of the brain were strongly positive for nestin in cediranibtreated patients but not in control brain tissues (Fig. 4B).
Expression of nestin by endothelial cells was confirmed by
double immunohistochemical staining and double immunofluorescent staining with the endothelial markers CD31 and
CD34, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Discussion
Proinfiltrating consequences of antiangiogenic therapy have
been suggested in a number of preclinical studies of GBM (21,
22). Rubenstein et al. showed in animal models that blocking
VEGF signaling by an antibody increases co-option and growth
of satellite tumors (21) and Du et al. showed that ablation of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) signaling leads to cooption and deep invasion of gliomas in mice (23). Casanovas
et al. have shown revascularization and increased invasiveness
after anti-VEGFR2 antibody therapy (24). Recently, Paez-Ribes
et al. have demonstrated that orthotopically implanted GBM
cells under a VEGFR-selective kinase inhibitor treatment as
well as VEGF/ GBM cells show significantly increased inva-

sion (25). Although our results are consistent with the "switch"
to a more invasive growth of human rGBMs after VEGF blockade, we found no evidence for a "rebound" revascularization.
Although MRI findings in patients have suggested increased
invasion as an adaptive response to bevacizumab (15, 26–28)
and cediranib (13, 14), the effects of antiangiogenic monotherapy on rGBM vasculature in patients remain largely unknown.
de Groot et al. showed in biopsies of patients with rGBM after
bevacizumab therapy that abnormal FLAIR areas contained
glioma cells diffusely infiltrating with a lack of glomeruloid
vascular proliferation (15). Our data did not show evidence of a
switch into alternative proangiogenic pathway as an escape
mechanism of recurrence under antiangiogenic therapy and
despite the significant time interval between the last dose of
cediranib and death, vascular morphology within the central
tumor was comparable with those of a normal brain in terms of
vascular density, diameter, basement membrane thickness,
and expression of PDGFRa, PDGFRb, CD71, VEGFR-2, and
Tie2. Furthermore, we observed decrease of cell density in the
central area of the tumor, despite proliferation and apoptotic
rates being similar to the tumors without antiangiogenic
therapy. The striking decrease of pseudopalisading necrosis
after cediranib therapy might be explained by vascular normal-

nestin in cediranib-treated rGBM.
A, diffuse c-Met expression was
seen in several tumor cells as well
as blood vessels (arrow) within the
tumor areas after cediranib
treatment. The blood vessels in
the contralateral brain tissue (not
involved by the tumor) of
cediranib-treated patients also
expressed c-Met (right, arrow)
whereas this was not seen in
control autopsy cases (inset),
where vessels in the brain tissue

ization after initial treatment diminishing hypoxic events
leading to this characteristic type of GBM necrosis (13).
The molecular pathways that drive GBM progression through
anti-VEGF therapy in patients remain largely unknown. We
detected PDGF-C and c-Met as 2 possible candidates. We also
detected nestin expression in endothelial cells in both tumor and
contralateral brain vessels in patients treated with cediranib.
Nestin is a marker of undifferentiated cells. This novel finding
could imply that sustained interruption of the VEGF signaling
might globally change the phenotype of all endothelial cells.
Further studies need to be undertaken in order to explore this
potential relationship between VEGF signaling and developmental cytoskeletal proteins. Resistance to anti-VEGF therapy
has also been linked to myeloid cell infiltration in preclinical
models of solid tumors (23, 29) and in lymphomas in patients
(30). Our data suggest that CXCR4þ tumor-associated macrophages infiltrate the tumor, possibly in response to transient
increase in SDF1a that correlated with rGBM progression during
cediranib therapy (13). However, our analyses did not show a
significant difference in tissue SDF1a expression between cediranib-treated and control GBMs at the time of autopsy. Despite
providing direct evidence for significant structural changes in
rGBMs after antiangiogenic therapy, this study has certain

Figure 5. Model of changes in infiltrating behavior of recurrent GBM induced by cediranib: the central area of a viable rGBM has high cell density with numerous

limitations. The small number of autopsy samples and the
natural heterogeneity of the disease warrants further studies
to confirm these findings. Our study also emphasizes the importance of autopsy evaluation and brain banking as the ultimate
clinicopathologic correlation of a drug effect as well as a crucial
step in connecting the clinical and preclinical studies.
In summary, our study provides first in-human morphologic evidence that anti-VEGF treatment changes the growth
pattern of rGBMs in patients with decreased microvascular
proliferation, loss of pseudopalisading necrosis and diffuse
spread into the adjacent normal brain (Fig. 5). Our results
show that instead of switching to alternative angiogenesis
pathways, rGBMs exhibit a more infiltrative phenotype after
antiangiogenic therapy.

tion and form a substantial proportion of the new vessels in gliomas (see
Ricci-Vitiani et al., Nature 468, 824–8 2010; and Wang et al., Nature 468,
829–33, 2010). These findings describe a new mechanism for tumor vasculogenesis, which is not blocked by VEGF inhibitors or VEGFR2 silencing.
These stem cells are nestin-positive, consistent with our evidence for nestin
expression in glioblastoma- and normal brain-associated endothelial cells in
glioblastoma patients previously treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition,
another report of a clinical trial of bevacizumab with chemoradiation showed
no apparent improvement in overall survival compared to chemoradiation
alone (Lai et al., J Clin Oncol, published online on Dec 6, 2010; doi: 10.1200/
JCO.2010.30.2729), which is consistent with the restoration of a blood-brain
barrier phenotype in glioblastoma vessels after anti-VEGF therapy described
in our report.
