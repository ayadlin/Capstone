Abstract
Tamoxifen, a small-molecule antagonist of the transcription
factor estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) used to treat breast
cancer, increases risks of endometrial cancer. However, no
parallels of ERa transcriptional action in breast and endometrial tumors have been found that might explain this effect. In
this study, we addressed this issue with a genome-wide assessment of ERa-chromatin interactions in surgical specimens
obtained from patients with tamoxifen-associated endometrial
cancer. ERa was found at active enhancers in endometrial
cancer cells as marked by the presence of RNA polymerase II
and the histone marker H3K27Ac. These ERa binding sites
were highly conserved between breast and endometrial cancer
and enriched in binding motifs for the transcription factor
FOXA1, which displayed substantial overlap with ERa binding
sites proximal to genes involved in classical ERa target genes.

Multifactorial ChIP-seq data integration from the endometrial
cancer cell line Ishikawa illustrated a functional genomic
network involving ERa and FOXA1 together with the enhancerenriched transcriptional regulators p300, FOXM1, TEAD4,
FNFIC, CEBP8, and TCF12. Immunohistochemical analysis of
230 primary endometrial tumor specimens showed that lack of
FOXA1 and ERa expression was associated with a longer
interval between breast cancer and the emergence of endometrial cancer, exclusively in tamoxifen-treated patients. Our
results deﬁne conserved sites for a genomic interplay between
FOXA1 and ERa in breast cancer and tamoxifen-associated
endometrial cancer. In addition, FOXA1 and ERa are associated
with the interval time between breast cancer and endometrial
cancer only in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Cancer

Introduction

lates ERa in certain other tissues, including the endometrium,
speciﬁcally in a low estrogen environment, i.e., postmenopausal
women (2–6).
Due to tissue-selective action of tamoxifen, postmenopausal
breast cancer patients on this drug have an increased risk of
endometrial cancer development by 2- to 7-fold, depending on
the duration of use (4, 5, 7, 8). This increased ERa activity
was linked with an altered expression level of coactivator SRC1
(9) and PAX2 (10) in endometrial cancer cells. However, manipulating expression levels of either SRC1 or PAX2 in breast cancer
cell line models did not support these ﬁndings (11, 12), implying
that these proteins are not the sole drivers of agonistic features of
tamoxifen observed in endometrial tissue. In addition, ERa
transcriptional regulation in endometrial cancer has exclusively
been studied using cell lines (13) while ERa genomic behavior in
primary human endometrial tumors remains unexplored.
For ERa to bind the chromatin in breast cancer cells, it
requires FOXA1 (14–16). FOXA1 is a pioneer factor, regulating
chromatin accessibility and thereby enables ERa-dependent
gene activation and proliferation of breast cancer cells (14).
FOXA1 was previously identiﬁed as one of the luminal breast
cancer–deﬁning transcription factors (17, 18), and its expression correlates with a favorable outcome in breast cancer
(19–21). In ERa-negative breast cancer cells, exogenous introduction of ERa and FOXA1 along with GATA3 was sufﬁcient to
reprogram these cells toward hormone responsiveness (22).

Of all breast tumors, roughly 75% depend on ERa for cell
proliferation and tumor progression. Consequently, most breast
cancer treatment modalities are aimed to inhibit ERa activity.
Tamoxifen is the most widely applied hormonal therapy, which
acts through competitive inhibition of ERa's natural ligand estrogen (1). Although tamoxifen inhibits ERa in breast cells, it stimu1

Cumulatively, these reports position FOXA1 as a crucial player
in ERa functionality in breast cancer. In endometrial cancer, the
pioneer factor for ERa is unknown, and the mechanisms that
dictate ERa action in this tissue remain elusive.
To study the genomic features of ERa in endometrial tumors,
we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) in surgical samples from ﬁve endometrial tumors
of patients who were previously treated with tamoxifen. ERa
binding sites in endometrial tumors were enriched for RNA
polymerase II as well as for H3K27Ac, the posttranslational
histone modiﬁcation that marks both active promoters and
active enhancers. Overlap of ERa chromatin binding sites was
observed between breast tumors and endometrial cancers. In
addition, we identiﬁed a genomic functional network in the
endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa, implicating FOXA1 and
ERa as part of a large multiprotein transcriptional network that
enrolls FOXM1, TEAD4, and TCF12. The direct clinical implications of this coordinated action between ERa and FOXA1 in
endometrial carcinogenesis was assessed for 230 endometrial
cancer patients who were previously treated for breast cancer. In
contrast to ERa, FOXA1 expression did not correlate with
endometrial cancer patient survival. Interestingly, both ERa and
FOXA1 expression did associate with short interval between
breast cancer treatment and endometrial cancer diagnosis, exclusively for the patients who received tamoxifen.
With this, we present a genomic conservation of ERa action
between breast and endometrial tumor specimens that highlights
FOXA1 as a common player of hormonal response in both tissues.

Materials and Methods
Patient series
Endometrial tumor tissue from 230 patients of the Tamoxifen
Associated Malignancies: Aspects of RISK (TAMARISK) study was
analyzed as described before (5, 7, 23). Clinicopathologic parameters from endometrial cancers can be found in Supplementary
Table S1. Tumor samples were analyzed anonymously, with
coded leftover material that cannot be traced back to the patients
that these materials originated from. This study was performed in
accordance with the Code of Conduct of the Federation of
Medical Scientiﬁc Societies in the Netherlands (http://www.
fmwv.nl). The study has been approved by the local medical
ethics committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
ChIPs and analyses
ChIPs were performed as described previously (24, 25) on
endometrioid andenocarcinoma tumors that are part of the
TAMARISK study (5, 7, 23). These endometrial tumors were
collected from patients who were still on tamoxifen on the day
of surgery or had stopped 1 to 2 months prior to surgery.
Clinicopathologic parameters can be found in Supplementary
Table S2. Tumor samples were cryosectioned, ﬁxed in 1% formaldehyde for 20 minutes, and processed for sonication. For each
ChIP, 10 mg of antibody, and 100 mL of Protein A (for ERa and
H3K27ac) and Protein G (for FOXA1 and RNA polymerase II)
magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were used. Antibodies raised to
detect ERa (SC-543; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RNA polymerase
II (ab5408; Abcam), H3K27ac (39133; Active Motif), and FOXA1/
2 (SC-6554; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The speciﬁcity
of SC-6554 antibody to detect FOXA1 was veriﬁed using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot using speciﬁc antibo-

dies (Seven Hills, WMAB-2F83 and WRAB-1200; Supplementary
Fig. S1). Primer sequences used for ChIP-qPCR are listed
in Supplementary Table S3. All Ishikawa ChIP-seq and RNA-seq
datasets were generated by the ENCODE consortium, and Supplementary Table S4 shows all accession numbers of the used
datasets that also includes breast cancer ERa ChIP-seq data from
Jansen and colleagues (25). Patient characteristics of breast cancer
tumors can be found in Supplementary Table S5.
Illumina sequencing and enrichment analysis
ChIP DNA was ampliﬁed as described (26). Sequences were
generated by the Illumina Hiseq 2000 genome analyzer (using
50-bp reads) and aligned to the Human Reference Genome (assembly hg19, February 2009). Reads were ﬁltered based on MAPQ
quality (reads with MAPQ>20) to eliminate reads from repetitive
elements. Peak calling was performed over input, using Dﬁlter (27)
and MACS peak caller version 1.4 (28). Only peaks identiﬁed using
both algorithms were considered. MACS was run with the default
parameters, except P ¼ 107. DFilter was run using settings bs ¼ 50,
ks ¼ 30, reﬁne, nonzero. Details on the number of reads obtained
and the percentage of reads aligned, and number of peaks called can
be found in Supplementary Table S6. Details on bioinformatics
analyses can be found in the Supplementary Methods.
RNA isolation and mRNA expression
RNA from tumors was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/
miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), using random hexamer
primers. RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (GC Biotech) on
a Roche Lightcycler, using 50 cycles of ampliﬁcation for all genes
tested. RT-PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S7.
Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray analyses
For immunohistochemical analysis, an antibody for FOXA1
was applied (2F83, Seven Hills Bioreagents). This antibody was
previously reported to be highly speciﬁc for FOXA1 (29). Antibody speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by Western blot (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Immunohistochemistry on the TAMARISK tissue microarray (TMA) was performed using a Ventana Benchmark Ultra
system, applying standard protocols. A kappa of 0.78 was calculated from scoring of two independent observers. ERa staining
was previously performed as described (7). Patients were categorized based on ERa and FOXA1 expression levels (at 10%
cutoff) and stratiﬁed over tamoxifen use. The mean time interval
between breast and endometrial cancer diagnosis was compared
between the groups and signiﬁcance of the differences was
assessed using the t-test. For survival analysis, Kaplan–Meier
survival plots were generated categorizing for ERa and FOXA1
expression levels and stratifying over tamoxifen use.
Data access
All sequencing data can be found at GEO (GSE81213).

ERa/FOXA1 Cross-talk in Endometrial Cancer

investigate tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer (5), ﬁve
endometrial tumors were analyzed from postmenopausal
patients who received tamoxifen to treat breast cancer (Fig.
1; Supplementary Table S2 for patient details). Endometrioid
adenocarcinomas were selected because these are generally
ERa-positive, irrespective of whether the endometrial tumor
was spontaneous or tamoxifen associated (7). For all ﬁve
tumors, ChIP-seq was performed for ERa as well as RNA
polymerase II and H3K27Ac, which marks histones both at
active promoters and active enhancers (Fig. 1A). Only for tumor
D, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq data were absent. Consistently between
all tumors, ERa sites were co-occupied by H3K27Ac and RNA
polymerase II (exempliﬁed in Fig. 1B, shown genome-wide
in Fig. 1C and quantiﬁed in Fig. 1D). For tumors C and E,
RNA polymerase II signal was relatively low at ERa sites
(Fig. 1B), but still quantiﬁably detected and enriched over
background (Fig. 1C and D). ChIP-seq peaks were successfully
validated by ChIP-qPCR for all three factors (Supplementary
Figs. S2A–S2C). Experiments were technically reproducible,
with considerable overlap between replicates for the same
tumor (ERa: Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.68; H3K27Ac:
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.88; see Supplementary Figs.
S3A–S3C). Between two sections from the same tumor, RNA
polymerase II ChIP-seq was more variable (Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient ¼ 0.41), suggesting intratumor heterogeneity of this
factor. Analogous to what was previously reported in breast
cancer specimens (25, 30), endometrial ERa is rarely found at
promoters and mainly binds distal intergenic regions and
introns (Fig. 1E). Cumulatively, these data illustrate that ERa
in tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumor specimens shows
the same pattern as previously identiﬁed in breast cancer,
mainly occupying active enhancer regions, positive for both
H3K27Ac and RNA polymerase II (Fig. 1F).
Conservation of ERa/chromatin binding between surgical
specimens of breast and endometrial cancer patients
ERa binds active enhancer regions in endometrial tumors,
analogous to what was found in breast cancer. To assess any
potential overlap in the chromatin binding distributions of
ERa between both tumor types, ChIP-seq data from the ﬁve
endometrial cancers (Fig. 1) were compared with publicly
available ERa ChIP-seq datasets we previously generated from
ﬁve breast tumors (Fig. 2A; ref. 25). As exempliﬁed, robust ERa
ChIP-seq signal was detected for both tumor types in all 10
tumors (Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous reports in breast
cancer (25, 30), a number of ERa binding sites greatly deviated
between tumor samples, as we now also show in endometrial
tumors (Fig. 2C). In total, 9,507 ERa interaction sites were
found in at least 2 out of 5 breast cancers, while 12,771 ERa
sites were found shared in at least 2 out of 5 endometrial
cancers. Between the two tumor types, 3,074 ERa sites were

shared (Fig. 2C). ERa sites shared between breast cancer and
endometrial cancer were robust as illustrated in a heatmap
(Fig. 2D, for quantiﬁcation see Supplementary Fig. S4). To
identify any potential transcriptional regulators that interact
with ERa at these sites, conserved chromatin binding events
between endometrial and breast tumors were mined for
enriched motifs (Fig. 2E). As expected, ERa binding sites in
both endometrial and breast tumors were strongly enriched for
ESR1 motifs (log10P ¼ 690.776). Interestingly, FOXA1 motifs
were also found highly enriched at ERa binding sites in both
tumor types (log10P ¼ 342.067). FOXA1 is classically known
to facilitate ERa/chromatin interactions in breast cancer
(15, 16), but our ﬁndings suggest that FOXA1 may play a
role for ERa functioning in tamoxifen-associated endometrial
cancer as well.
Genomic interactions of FOXA1 and ERa in endometrial
tumor specimens
FOXA1 motifs were enriched at ERa binding sites present in
both breast and endometrial cancer samples. Immunohistochemistry analysis validated ERa and FOXA1 expression in
both tumor types (Fig. 3A). This was previously reported by
others for breast cancer (30, 31) as well as endometrial cancer
(32–34). Next, we performed ChIP-seq for FOXA1 in the ﬁve
endometrioid adenocarcinoma specimens that were previously
used to ChIP ERa, RNA polymerase II, and H3K27ac. We
directly compared these FOXA1 binding patterns with ERa
proﬁles within the same tumor (Fig. 3B). For tumor D, FOXA1
ChIP-seq signal was not observed (tested in two biologic replicates), nor did we detect its mRNA expression (Supplementary
Fig. S5). FOXA1 binding sites as identiﬁed by ChIP-seq could
successfully be validated by ChIP-qPCR (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). Furthermore, FOXA1 ChIP-seq was technically robust
(Pearson correlation coefﬁcient ¼ 0.67; Supplementary Fig.
S3D). ERa and FOXA1 were found at overlapping genomic
locations in all tested tamoxifen-associated endometrioid adenocarcinomas, which were also shared with the endometrioid
adenocarcinoma cancer cell line Ishikawa (Fig. 3B and C,
quantiﬁed in D). For FOXA1, 549 sites were shared between
two out of four endometrial tumors. For ERa, 4,623 sites were
shared in at least three out of ﬁve tumors (Fig. 3C and D).
However, raw data analyses illustrated that at ERa binding sites,
FOXA1 signal was generally observed at the same genomic
regions. This suggests that false negativity was observed due to
the peak-calling threshold. Analogous to these ﬁndings, FOXA1
sites were commonly positive for ERa (Fig. 3C and quantiﬁed
in Fig. 3D). Next, potential interacting transcriptional regulators
were identiﬁed by motif enrichment analysis. As expected, forkhead motifs and ESR motifs were found for regions bound by
ERa as well as FOXA1 (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, additional motifs
were identiﬁed for transcription factors previously described to

ERa/FOXA1 Cross-talk in Endometrial Cancer

be involved in endometrial cancer, including androgen receptor
(35), progesterone receptor (36), RORB (37), as well as SOX
proteins (38). Cumulatively, these data implicate that FOXA1
binds to ERa sites in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer
that are potentially co-occupied by other transcription factors.
Endometrial FOXA1/ERa sites mark a regulatory transcription
factor hub at enhancers
Endometrial tumors express ERa as well as FOXA1, which
share substantial overlap in binding sites. Importantly, ERa and
FOXA1 chromatin binding proﬁles of Ishikawa cells are shared
with primary endometrial tumor tissue samples, suggesting
applicability of this cell line model to analyze the correlation
between FOXA1 and ERa binding sites and to identify transcriptomic regulation at these sites (Fig. 3). In Ishikawa,
approximately 20% of FOXA1 binding sites overlap with ERa
binding sites (Fig. 4A), yielding a concise list of 599 shared
ERa/FOXA1 binding sites in this cell line. Compared to ERa
unique binding sites and sites shared between ERa and FOXA1,
the genomic regions uniquely bound by FOXA1 were markedly
higher enriched at promoter regions (Fig. 4B). Next, we analyzed DNA motifs in genomic regions bound exclusively by
ERa, FOXA1, or shared by both transcription factors (Fig. 4C).
Sites shared by ERa and FOXA1 showed enrichment for ESR1
motifs as well as Forkhead transcription factors. As expected,
ERa unique binding sites were devoid of Forkhead motifs,
while FOXA1 unique sites lacked ESR1 motifs, suggesting no
false negativity for the unique binding site subsets. Apart from
ERa and FOXA1 motifs, other transcription factors were found
selectively enriched between the peak subsets. Substantial
overlap was found between these motifs and those found in
tumors (Fig. 3E). Out of 106 motifs, 85 transcription factors
were expressed in Ishikawa cells, based on publicly available
RNA-seq data, which was generated as part of the ENCODE
consortium (for accession numbers of used datasets see Supplementary Table S4). To provide experimental validation of
the identiﬁed motifs, publicly available ChIP-seq datasets
where used from Ishikawa cells (for GEO accession numbers
see Supplementary Table S4). In accordance with the motif
analyses, CTCF chromatin binding was found at FOXA1 sites,
but not at ERa sites. Most other transcriptional regulators
(TEAD4, EP300, FOXM1, MAX, NFIC, RAD21, SRF, TCF12,
USF1) showed signal for unique regions of ERa and FOXA1,
but was strongest at regions co-occupied by both FOXA1 and
ERa (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S6 for quantiﬁcations).
Furthermore, these transcription factors were tested for expression analysis in tamoxifen-associated cancers and Ishikawa
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). All tested transcription factors

were expressed in at least 3 out of 4 tumors and found expressed in Ishikawa cells. Genes that correspond to genomic regions
bound by ERa and FOXA1 were identiﬁed (<20 kb upstream of
transcriptional start site or within gene body; see Materials and
Methods) and used for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to reveal
the network in which these proteins operate. As expected, ESR1
(P ¼ 8.71E08) was identiﬁed as a top upstream regulator.
Accordingly, the top enriched network was centered around
ESR1 (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Table S8). All genes in this
pathway were under control of ERa signaling, as identiﬁed by
RNA-seq data integration from Ishikawa cells, treated for 4
hours with estradiol or vehicle control (Fig. 4E; Supplementary
Table S4).
To investigate the transcription factor context in which ERa
and FOXA1 operate, we performed unsupervised hierarchical
clustering based on the identiﬁed binding patterns for all
analyzed transcriptional regulators, which resulted in the identiﬁcation of distinct functional genomic clusters (Fig. 4F).
Cluster 1 was enriched for transcriptional regulators found at
promoter regions (Fig. 4G), such as RNA polymerase II, TAF1,
YY1, MAX, EGR1, ZBTB7A, USF1, SRF, and CREB1 (Fig. 4F).
Cluster 2, which contained ERa and FOXA1 binding regions,
was enhancer enriched (Fig. 4G) and showed clustering among
p300, FOXM1, NR3C1 (Glucocorticoid Receptor), TEAD4,
NFIC, TCF12, and CEBPB. These cell line data are in agreement
with primary tumor data where ERa was found to bind active
enhancers (Fig. 1). Cumulatively, these data implicate genomic
locations shared by ERa and FOXA1 as central genomic hubs
for enhancer action, where multiple transcriptional regulators
bind proximal to genes involved in classical estrogen-regulated
processes.
Interplay of FOXA1 and ERa in tamoxifen-associated
endometrial cancer
ERa's functional activity is linked with FOXA1 in tamoxifenassociated endometrial cancer. We next determined the potential
clinical implications of the interplay of FOXA1 and ERa in this
context (Fig. 5), using TMAs from the TAMARISK study (7). The
TAMARISK study involves samples from 230 endometrial tumors
that were collected from patients who were previously diagnosed
with breast cancer, half of whom received tamoxifen (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Table S1). We assessed the interval time between
breast cancer diagnosis and endometrial cancer diagnosis as well
as endometrial cancer-related survival. These clinical variables
were tested for association with ERa and FOXA1 levels, as determined by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5B for example staining).
Scatter plot visualizations illustrated that FOXA1 and ERa positive cells in endometrial tumor specimens do not associate

ERa/FOXA1 Cross-talk in Endometrial Cancer

(Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting that ERa and FOXA1 expression levels may identify different patient groups. Therefore,
tumors were categorized in groups that express only ERa, only
FOXA1, both ERa and FOXA1, or neither. Most endometrial
tumors are positive for both ERa and FOXA1, irrespective of
treatment (Fig. 5C). FOXA1þ/ERa tumors were enriched among
tamoxifen-treated patients at the expense of the tumors that are
positive for both ERa and FOXA1 (Fisher exact test: P ¼ 0.018).

patient survival, in agreement with previous immunohistochemical reports (39, 40). In contrast to previous reports (33, 34),
FOXA1 expression did not associate with survival of endometrial
cancer patients, irrespective whether they did (Fig. 5D) or did not
receive tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S8). Interestingly, tamoxifen-treated patients who developed an endometrial tumor had a
shorter interval time between breast cancer and endometrial
cancer when their endometrial tumor expressed ERa and/or
FOXA1 (ERa: P ¼ 0.02, FOXA1: P ¼ 0.02; ERa/FOXA1: P <
0.001; Fig. 5E). For patients who did not receive tamoxifen
treatment for breast cancer, no signiﬁcant differences in interval
time between breast cancer and endometrial cancer diagnosis
were found, based on ERa and FOXA1 levels in the endometrial
tumor (Supplementary Fig. S9). Our data implicate a coordinated
action between ERa and FOXA1, associated with a short interval
time between breast cancer and endometrial cancer development
in the tamoxifen-treated cases, without affecting endometrial
cancer-related survival.

Discussion
Tamoxifen is a highly successful drug in the treatment of breast
cancer. However, tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial
cancer. This direct link between breast cancer treatment and endometrial cancer development suggests a crucial role for ERa in both
tumor types. Tamoxifen has been reported in endometrial cells to
stimulate the recruitment of coactivators to a subset of genes,
similar to estrogen (9). Between a breast cancer cell line and an
endometrial cancer cell line, limited overlap of ERa sites was
observed (13), giving rise to differential gene expression between
those cell lines following ligand treatment. More recently, the same
lab reported shared ERa sites between these cell lines to be
associated with strong EREs, inaccessible chromatin regions and
lack of DNA methylation (29). In contrast, non–ERE-mediated
ERa action was found dominant in tissue-type speciﬁc interactions,
which co-occurred with other transcription factors and cell-type
speciﬁc chromatin accessibility (29). This previous report was

based on a single endometrial cancer cell line, while our study is
the ﬁrst to assess genomic behavior of ERa in several surgical
specimens of endometrial cancer patients. We show a signiﬁcant
level of ERa overlap between breast cancer samples and endometrial cancer samples, being enriched for ESR1 and FOXA1 motifs.
With this, our data illustrate that functional characterization of ERa
genomic action can be accelerated by a joined analysis on cell line
studied in conjunction with primary human tissue specimens.
Analogous to previous observations in breast cancer, endometrial ERa preferably binds enhancers, which were marked by
H3K27ac and RNA polymerase II, suggesting that these enhancers are active. Furthermore, ERa binding events in endometrial
tumor specimens are enriched for motifs of well-established
transcriptional regulators in the ﬁeld of breast cancer, including
FOXA1 (15). FOXA1 was previously reported to be expressed in
endometrial tissue, and downregulated in poorly differentiated
endometrial cancer (32) where low FOXA1 is associated with
poor outcome (33, 34). In line with these previous reports, we
show that endometrial tumor cells express FOXA1, even though
we do not observe an association of FOXA1 with clinical
outcome in endometrial cancer in our cohort. Because patients
in our cohort developed both breast cancer as well as endometrial cancer (7), we may have enriched for patients with a
genetic predisposition to developing both tumors types. Therefore, our study population may be intrinsically different from
sporadic cases that only developed endometrial cancer (33).
Here, we illustrate that FOXA1 chromatin binding sites are
shared with ERa in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer.
These sites are not exclusively bound by ERa or FOXA1, but are
in fact regulated through a large multiprotein transcriptional
network, jointly mediating ERa-driven gene proﬁles in endometrial cancer.
Multiple other proteins found to associate with breast cancer
outcome have been implicated in endometrial cancer development, including PAX2 (10, 12) and SRC1 (9, 41). Here, we show
that FOXA1 can be added to this list, exposing a bivalent role in
response to tamoxifen treatment, dependent on tissue type; while
high FOXA1 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in breast
cancer (21), its expression levels associate with short interval time
between breast cancer diagnosis and tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer development without affecting outcome in this
cohort. This closely follows parallel observations made for PAX2,
and validates inverse relations of transcriptional regulators
between breast and endometrial cancer with respect to tumorigenesis and response to endocrine agents.

ERa/FOXA1 Cross-talk in Endometrial Cancer

To conclude, we show that endometrial tumor cells express
FOXA1, serving the classical ERa-pioneer factor role as was
originally identiﬁed in breast cancer (15).
Yet, instead of facilitating the inhibitory potential of tamoxifen on ERa activity, FOXA1 may enable receptor activation
through tamoxifen in endometrial tissue in postmenopausal women. This function of FOXA1 has far-reaching consequences, where it may dictate the stimulatory effects of
tamoxifen treatment on endometrial cancer development.
