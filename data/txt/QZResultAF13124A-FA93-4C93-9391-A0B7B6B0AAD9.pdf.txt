BACKGROUND. Substantial variation in adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy dosThe purpose of this study was to investigate variations in dose determinations in
clinical trial protocols and publications over the last 3 decades as potential

METHODS. The National Cancer Institute database was used to identify protocols
of breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy conducted by cooperative groups
between 1970–2000, and these protocols were then obtained directly from the cooperative groups. Dose determinations were categorized in each protocol and in
published reports from each clinical trial. Fisher exact tests were used to compare the proportions of protocols that used full weight-based doses over time.
RESULTS. Protocol-specified chemotherapy dosing was obtained for all of 44 eligible trials. A significant increase was identified in the use of full weight-based
doses in the later time period compared with the earlier (P 5 .004; 2-sided Fisher
exact test). A notable exception was 1 cooperative group that continues to require
dose limitations for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in patients with a body
surface area of more than 2.0 m2. Regardless of publication date, published
reports of clinical trials rarely provide information on use of full or limited

weight-based doses.
CONCLUSIONS. Variations in dose determinations among clinical trial protocols
and lack of information on use of full weight-based doses in most publications
are 2 likely sources of variation in chemotherapy dosing in obese women. Developing consensus and disseminating information on optimal chemotherapy dosing will likely reduce such variation and may improve survival among obese
patients with breast cancer. Cancer 2008;112:2159–65.  2008 American Cancer

hemotherapy doses in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer
are generally normalized to body by size using the patient’s
body surface area (BSA). The BSA is, in turn, calculated by using
height and weight according to one of several methods.1 Although
the majority of overweight and obese women are treated with full
weight-based chemotherapy doses, the practice of administering
reduced doses (compared with those doses that would be expected
if actual weight were used to calculate chemotherapy) to heavy
women is common.2–5 For example, in a national study of patients
treated in 901 practices with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer between 2002 and 2005, 13.8% of overweight patients, 17.7% of

obese patients, and 26.6% of severely obese women
received initial dose reductions of greater than 15%
when compared with doses that would have been
given had full weight-based dosing been used.
Reduced doses were not explained by age, comorbidity, or other clinical factors.6 The use of reduced
doses varies according to treating physician2 and
even according to geographic region.6 Such practice
variation suggests that there is uncertainty about the
optimal dosing of chemotherapy, including perhaps
the safety and necessity of using actual body weight
when calculating chemotherapy doses. Uncertainty
clearly persists despite compelling evidence that full
weight-based doses are not only safe but also necessary if the full benefit of chemotherapy is to be
achieved.7–9
The purpose of the current study was to answer
the following questions: 1) How have cooperative
groups specified that chemotherapy doses be determined in obese patients? That is, do protocols specify the use of full weight-based doses or a dosing
limit? 2) Is there variation among cooperative groups
in how chemotherapy doses are determined? 3) How
much information is available on chemotherapy dose
determinations in published articles from cooperative group trials?
The premise of this study is that clinical trial
protocols provide a standard of care for prescribing
physicians with respect to such issues as dose determinations in studies of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy. A second premise is that physicians use
published medical literature to inform their chemotherapy-prescribing decisions and that lack of information on dosing contributes to uncertainty about
best chemotherapy dosing practices in the treatment
of obese women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dose determinations in cooperative group clinical
trials are not compiled in a central source, and publications rarely provide information on dosing limits
(see below). Primary data collection thus involved
the retrieval of study protocols from cooperative
groups in the United States and in Europe. We used
the Physician Data Query (PDQ) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to identify all registered and completed cooperative group, nonmyeloablative, breast
cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy clinical trials. The
search, which was conducted in August 2005 and
repeated in April 2007, was limited to closed protocols that enrolled female patients with stage I, II, or
III breast cancer and that used chemotherapy. We
did not limit by geographic location or trial activa-

tion date. Each trial in the generated set of trials was
individually examined and required to meet the following criteria. We included only adjuvant, nonmyeloablative, chemotherapy trials that were authored by
1 or more cooperative groups. Myeloablative regimens that required stem-cell support or bone-marrow support were excluded because the doses of
chemotherapy used in myeloablative regimens are
generally several-fold higher than those used in
standard adjuvant regimens, and there is little information on safety of full weight-based doses in this
setting. The only remaining inclusion criterion for
each trial was the publication of an article or articles
that reported patient survival by using data from no
more than 2 clinical trials. Written protocols were
requested from each cooperative group.
Dosing instructions were categorized into 1 of 3
categories: 1) full weight-based dosing, 2) dose
adjustment or maximum limit in heavy patients
(ideal or corrected body weight used to calculate BSA
or a maximum BSA ‘‘cap’’), or 3) no specific instructions.
We searched PubMed, Ovid, the NCI database,
the cooperative group websites, and the Dana Farber
Cancer Institute database to identify for each trial a
published article that focused on outcomes. In cases
where more than 1 article reported on outcomes, 1
article was selected at random. For each article, dose
determinations in obese patients were categorized
into 1 of the 3 categories described above.
Fisher exact test was used to compare the proportion of trials that specified use of full weightbased dosing (no dose limits) during the study time
period and the proportion of published studies that
provided information on the use of full doses versus
limited doses.
Permission was obtained from either the cooperative group chairperson or disease-site chairperson
of the cooperative group to allow us to publish information on protocol-specified details of dose determinations and limits.

RESULTS
Clinical Trial Protocols
Search criteria generated 44 eligible clinical trials
from the NCI database spanning the years 1970
through 2000. Dosing instructions were successfully
obtained for all. The included protocols are listed in
Table 1.
Eleven (25%) of the protocols used actual body
weight in dose determinations. Nineteen (43%) specified some form of dose limits, whether through use
of ideal body weight, the lesser of actual or ideal

body weight, adjusted ideal body weight, or a BSA
limit of 2.0 m2. Dose determinations changed over
time (Fig. 1) and were more likely to be specified in
later protocols. Of the 22 protocols initiated through
December 1984, 21 (95%) either did not directly
address dose determinations in heavy patients
(n 5 9) or specified dose reduction (n 5 12) in heavy
patients. One trial specified use of actual body
weight in dose determinations. Of the 22 protocols
initiated after 1984, 10 (45%) specified full weight-

2161

based dosing, 7 (32%) specified dose limits, and 5
(23%) provided no specific information on chemotherapy dosing in heavy patients. The difference in
the use of full weight-based doses in the 2 time periods was significant (P 5 .004; 2-sided Fisher exact
test). All protocols that required dose limits were
authored by 1 cooperative group and specified dose
limits only for cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin;
no dose limitations were specified for taxanes. The 4
remaining US cooperative groups required full
weight-based doses in protocols initiated after 1984.

Clinical Trial Publications
Information on chemotherapy dose determinations
in published clinical trial reports corresponding to
cooperative group protocols is shown in Figure 2. Of
the 43 published articles (1 article reported on findings from 2 trials; see Table 2), information on dose
determination in heavy patients was included in only
10 (23%). Dosing information was provided in 8
(42%) of the 19 publications from studies that specified dose limits compared with only 2 (18%) of the
11 that used actual weight-based doses, but this difference was not statistically significant (P 5 .25; 2sided Fisher exact test).

DISCUSSION
Early cooperative group protocols included in the
Physician Data Query of the National Cancer Institute used dose limits or did not address dosing practices in obese patients. Over the last 2 decades, all
but 1 of the United States cooperative groups and 1
of the 2 European cooperative groups have specified
use of actual body weight with no dose limitations in
trial participants. Information on dosing practices is
generally lacking in published reports of these clinical trials.
A substantial body of research supports the use
of full weight-based doses in heavy patients who are
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.7–14
There is no evidence that use of actual body weight
to determine chemotherapy doses is associated with
greater myeloid or nonmyeloid toxicity.2,7–12 Moreover, receipt of full weight-based doses appears to be
required for patients, particularly for those with
estrogen receptor-negative tumors, to achieve the full
benefit of chemotherapy.7,9 For example, in 1 clinical
trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil, obese patients
who had a 5% or greater reduction in chemotherapy
doses below those expected if actual body weight
were used had inferior failure-free survival.7 Likewise,

in a pooled analysis of 4 adjuvant chemotherapy
trials, obese patients with hormone receptor-negative
breast cancer who received less than 85% of full
weight-based doses had inferior disease-free and
overall survival.9 On the basis of available evidence,
the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) generated
a written policy in 2001 (Siu-Fun Wong, PhD, personal communication) that actual body weight should
always be used in calculating treatment doses in
patients who are participating in clinical trials. The
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) considers
failure to use actual body weight in the calculation
of drug doses to be a major protocol deviation.

Despite evidence against dose limits in heavy
patients who are receiving adjuvant breast cancer
chemotherapy, many obese and overweight patients
receive reduced chemotherapy doses as described
above.2–5 The present-day practice of limiting adjuvant chemotherapy doses in heavy patients and the
finding that use of reduced chemotherapy doses varies according to provider suggests that there is persistent uncertainty about best practices for this patient
population. The finding that the protocols of 1 of the
largest cooperative groups specify dose limits of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin suggests that
uncertainty may also exist among clinical trialists.

Dose determinations specified within clinical
trial protocols may serve as a form of guideline for
chemotherapy dosing in heavy patients, even in
patients being treated ‘‘off protocol.’’ The lack of information on chemotherapy dosing in most of the
corresponding published articles further indicates
that physicians may not have sufficient information
on standard practices in the dosing of obese patients.
Without specific information to the contrary, a physician may elect to fall back on older practices of limiting doses in the heavy patient.
Our study is restricted to published cooperative
group trials registered in the Physician Data Query.
The findings of this survey thus cannot be generalized to all published clinical trials of adjuvant breast

cancer chemotherapy. Nonetheless, cooperative group
trials are highly influential, and their publications are
widely cited.
We contend that present-day variations in chemotherapy dosing in heavy patients represent unwarranted variation.15 Developing and disseminating
standards for dose determinations in heavy patients
is critical to decreasing variation in dosing practices
and may improve outcomes among obese women.
As the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity
increases,16 we suggest that cooperative groups come
to consensus on dose determinations in obese
patients on the basis of existing evidence and further
suggest that guideline-development groups and biomedical journals provide specific information on the

Clinical Trial Adjuvant Dosing of Obese Patients/Greenman et al.

standard of care for dosing obese patients who are
receiving adjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy.17
