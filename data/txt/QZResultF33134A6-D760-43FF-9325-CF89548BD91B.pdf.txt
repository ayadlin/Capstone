ROS and CHOP Are Critical for Dibenzylideneacetone to
Sensitize Tumor Cells to TRAIL through Induction of Death
Receptors and Downregulation of Cell Survival Proteins
Sahdeo Prasad, Vivek R. Yadav, Jayaraj Ravindran, and Bharat B. Aggarwal

Abstract
Because tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) selectively kills tumor cells, it
is being tested in cancer patients. Unfortunately, patients develop resistance to the cytokine, therefore, agents
that can sensitize cells to TRAIL are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated whether dibenzylideneacetone (DBA) can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL and potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As indicated by
accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine, DNA breaks, intracellular esterase activity,
and activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3, we concluded that DBA potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon
cancer cells. DBA also converted TRAIL resistant-cells to TRAIL-sensitive. When examined for the mechanism,
we found that DBA decreased the expression of antiapoptotic proteins and decoy recptor-2 and increased
proapoptotic proteins. DBA also induced both death receptor (DR)-5 and DR4. Knockdown of DR5 and DR4 by
small interfering RNA (SiRNA) reduced the sensitizing effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition,
DBA increased the expression of CHOP proteins. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA decreased the induction of
DBA-induced DR5 expression and apoptosis. Induction of receptors by DBA, however, was p53-independent, as
deletion of p53 had no effect on receptor induction. We observed that DBA-induced induction of DR5 and DR4
was mediated through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as N-acetylcysteine blocked the induction of
death receptors and suppression of cell survival proteins by DBA. Overall, our results show that DBA potentiates
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through downregulation of cell survival proteins and upregulation of death receptors
via activation of ROS and CHOP mediated pathways. Cancer Res; 71(2); 538–49. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is a major public health problem in the United
States and many other parts of the world. In 2009 in the United
States, a total of 1,479,350 new cancer cases and 562,340
deaths from cancer are projected to occur (1). Also the
incidence of prostate, lung, breast, and colon cancer are higher
in Western countries than in Eastern countries (2). Surgical
excision and/or radiotherapy typically are the first-line of
treatments, but many cancers recur in spite of these. Furthermore, although recurrent cancers may respond to chemotherapeutic, cytotoxic, and immunomodulating agents but also
may develop resistance to this.

The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) emerges as one of the mostpromising experimental cancer therapeutic drug, which is
currently being tested in clinical trials (3–5). TRAIL induces
apoptosis on binding to its specific receptors called death
receptors. To date, 5 TRAIL receptors have been reported:
death receptor (DR) 5, also called TRAIL-R2, TRICK2 or (6–10),
DR4, decoy receptor (DcR) 1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin (11).
Only DR4 and DR5 can mediate TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The
other receptors play a dominant negative role by competing
with DR4 and DR5 for interaction with TRAIL. Some studies
showed that repeated administration of soluble TRAIL was
not toxic to normal tissues in mice (12) and in non-human
primates (13), however, other data suggest that cultured
human hepatocytes may be sensitive to the soluble forms
of TRAIL (14, 15).
Because many human tumor cells are found to develop
resistance to TRAIL (16, 17), investigators are examining
TRAIL pathways for ways to overcome this resistance. The
resistance could be due to overexpression of cell survival
proteins, such as bcl-2, bcl-xl, XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and cFLIP
or to overexpression of decoy receptors or to limited expression of cell signaling death receptors on the cell surface (18–
20). Therefore, agents are needed that can sensitize the cancer
cells to TRAIL.

Dibenzylideneacetone (DBA, Fig. 1A) is one such agent
that has been shown to induce apoptosis in colon cancer
cells through a p53- independent mechanism via inhibition
of isopeptidase (21). It inhibits the growth of melanoma in
vitro and in vivo through inhibition of N-myristoyltransferase-1, abrogation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, suppression of Akt, downregulation of STAT-3, and inhibition of
S6 kinase activation (22). Whether DBA can sensitize tumor
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is not known. Our investigation of this question is detailed in the this report. The
results are described to show that DBA can potentiate
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through downregulation of cell
survival proteins, upregulation of death receptors via

antibody was obtained from Aldrich-Sigma. Antibodies
against bcl-xL, bcl-2, bax, cFLIP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-1, CHOP, phospho-Akt1/2,
and annexin V staining kit were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.
Cell lines
HCT116 (human colon adenocarcinoma), HT29 (human
colon adenocarcinoma), A293 (human embryonic kidney
carcinoma), PC3 and DU145 (human prostate cancer cells),
MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cells), SCC4 (human
squamous cell carcinoma), Caco2 (human colon cancer
cells), U266 (human multiple myeloma), and KBM-5 (human
chronic leukemic cells) were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. HCT116 variants with deletion of p53
and bax were kindly supplied by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) were cultured in
McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen). HCT116, A293, MDAMB-231, and SCC4 were cultured in DMEM, Caco2, PC3,
DU145, U266, and HT29 cell lines were cultured in
RPMI1640. KBM-5 cells were cultured in IMDM. All the
media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
except IMDM contains 15%. The above-mentioned cell lines
were procured more than 6 months ago and have not been
tested recently for authentication in our laboratory.
Live/dead assay
To measure apoptosis, we used Live/Dead assay kit (Invitrogen). We stained the cells according to the manufacturer's
instructions. In principle, calcein-AM, a nonfluorescent polyanionic dye, is retained by live cells, in which it produces
intense green fluorescence through enzymatic (esterase) conversion. In addition, the ethidium homodimer enters cells with
damaged membranes and binds to nucleic acids, thereby
producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells. Cells were
analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2;
Nikon).
Cytotoxicity assay
The effects of DBA on TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity were
determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) uptake method (23).
Annexin V/PI assay
The early indicator of apoptosis was detected by using
annexin V/PI binding kit (Santacruz) and then analyzed with
a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometry for cell-cycle distribution
To determine the effect of DBA on the cell cycle, treated and
untreated cells were stained with PI as mentioned earlier (24).
Analysis of cell surface expression of DR4 and DR5
Treated and untreated cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human DR5 or DR4
(R&D Systems) for 45 minutes at 4 C according to the
manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry

with phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG2B as an isotype
control.
Western blot analysis
To determine the levels of protein expression, whole-cell
extracts were prepared in lysis buffer as described earlier (23).
Transfection with siRNA
HCT116 cells were plated in each well of 6-well plates and
allowed to adhere for 24 hours. On the day of transfection, 12
mL Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was added to 50
nmol/L siRNA in a final volume of 100 mL culture medium.
After 48 hours of transfection, cells were treated with DBA for
12 hours and then exposed to TRAIL for 24 hours.
Measurement of ROS
Intracellular ROS of cells were detected as described elsewhere (23).
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean  SE of 3 independent
experiments. Statistical significance was determined using
unpaired Student's t-test and a P value of less than 0.001
was considered statistically significant.

Results
The objective of this study was to determine whether DBA
can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The mechanisms
by which DBA might enhance the effect of this cytokine, was
also investigated in detail. For most experiments, we
employed human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116; however, our results were not restricted to this tumor cell line.
We also used various other cell lines. HT29 colon cancer
cells, which are known to be resistant to TRAIL, are also used
to determine whether DBA can also sensitize these cells to
TRAIL.
DBA potentiates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in colon
cancer cells
Whether DBA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell
death was investigated by the MTT method. The HCT116
cells were moderately sensitive to either DBA or TRAIL alone.
However, pretreatment with DBA significantly (P < 0.001)
enhanced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 1B, left).
To confirm the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
we measured apoptosis by Live/Dead assay. We found that
DBA induced up to 18% cell death whereas TRAIL alone
showed 10% apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, the
combination treatment with DBA and TRAIL enhanced apoptosis up to 62% apoptosis (Fig. 1B, right).
Next, we examined the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in HCT116 cells by phosphatidylserine externalization using the annexin V/PI assay. The results shown in Figure
1C (top) indicate that DBA and TRAIL-induced apoptosis
(including early, late, and necrosis) about 29% and 23%,
respectively; and the combination increased the apoptosis
to 81%.

DBA Potentiates TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

To further determine the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced
cytotoxicity, we also investigated the distribution of cells by PI
staining. We found that treatment of DBA or TRAIL alone
showed moderate apoptosis, whereas treatment of both
showed enhanced cell death (Fig. 1C, bottom).
In addition, we examined the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced
activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and on cleavage of PARP. We
found that DBA enhanced TRAIL-induced activation of all 3
caspases, thus leading to enhanced PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, these results suggest that DBA enhanced
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
DBA downregulates the expression of cell survival
proteins
We next examined the mechanism underlying DBA's
enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Because various
antiapoptotic proteins are known to regulate TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, we investigated whether DBA potentiates TRAILinduced apoptosis through regulation of these proteins. DBA
inhibited expression of XIAP, survivin, bcl-2, and both the
short and long forms of cFLIP but had no effect on expression
of bcl-xL (Fig. 2A). Thus our results suggest that downregulation of cell survival proteins is one of the mechanisms by
which DBA potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
DBA upregulates the expression of proapoptotic
proteins
In our next set of experiments, we found that DBA cleaved
the proapoptotic protein bid and induced the expression of
proapoptotic bax (Fig. 2B). These 2 effects are additional ways
DBA could enhance the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. However,
DBA did not induce DR5 in bax knockout HCT116 cells
indicating induction of DR5 by DBA is not dependent on
bax (Supplementary Fig. 1).
DBA regulates activation of GSK-3b
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta has been linked with
resistance of cells to TRAIL (25, 26). Whether DBA affects
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through inhibition of GSK-3b, was
examined. We found that DBA downregulated the phosphorylation of GSK-3b (Fig. 2C), thus suggesting that inhibition of
activation of this kinase may also contribute to its ability to
increase sensitivity of tumor cells to TRAIL.
DBA upregulates expression of death receptor TRAILR1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5
Because TRAIL mediates its activity through the receptors
DR4 and DR5; therefore, we investigated whether DBA potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis is through modulation of DR5
and DR4 expression. Treatment of HCT116 cells with various
concentrations of DBA for 24 hours resulted in an increased
expression of TRAIL-R2/DR5 and TRAIL-R1/DR4 in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A, left). The effect on DR5 was more
pronounced than on DR4. We also examined whether induction of the TRAIL receptor is time-dependent. For this, cells
were treated with DBA (15 mmol/L) for different times and
then examined for expression of DR5 and DR4 protein. DBA
induced both DR5 and DR4 in a time-dependent manner

proteins, and GSK-3b (C). The same blots were stripped and reprobed with
b-actin antibody to verify equal protein loading.

(Fig. 3A, right). These data suggest that upregulation of death
receptors DR4 and/or DR5 by DBA may be another mechanism by which the agent enhances the proapoptotic effects of
TRAIL in colon cancer cells.
Whether DBA enhances the expression of DRs on cell
surface was also examined. We found that DBA increased
cell surface levels of DR5 and DR4 (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these
results indicate that DBA upregulated the expression of both
DRs on the cell surface.
DBA downregulates decoy receptor
Decoy molecules compete with the death receptors for
ligand binding and thereby inhibit ligand-induced apoptosis

(27, 28), so we determined whether DBA modulates DcR
expression. We found that indeed DBA decreased the expression of DcR2, but it did not influence the level of DcR1
(Fig. 3C). Therefore inhibition of DcR2 by DBA may potentiate
TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
DBA-induced upregulation of death receptors is not
cell-type specific
Whether upregulation of TRAIL receptors by DBA was
specific to HCT116 was investigated. We exposed the following cells to 15 mmol/L DBA: KBM-5, U266, MDA-MB-231, PC3,
DU145, Caco2, A293 cells, and SCC4 cells for 24 hours. DBA
induced the expression of both DR5 and DR4 in almost all of
these cell lines (Fig. 3D). Besides HCT116 cells, DR5 and DR4
were also induced in KBM5, U266, SCC4, A293, DU145, and

TRAIL receptors by DBA was not cell-type specific.
DBA-induced death receptors are needed for TRAILinduced apoptosis
The importance of death receptors to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was investigated using siRNA specific to DR5 and DR4.
Transfection of cells with siRNA for DR5 but not with the
control siRNA reduced DBA-induced DR5 expression (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, transfection of cells with siRNA for DR4 reduced the
DBA-induced DR4 expression but not DR5 (Fig. 4A).
We next examined whether the suppression of DR5 or DR4
by siRNA could abrogate the sensitizing effects of DBA on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis using Live/Dead Assay. The results
reveal that the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was

effectively abolished in cells transfected with either DR5 or
DR4 siRNA (Fig. 4B), whereas treatment with control siRNA
had no effect. Silencing of DR5 had a more dramatic effect on
DBA's ability to potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis than
DR4, thus suggesting that both DR5 and DR4 play a major
role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
DBA-induced upregulation of TRAIL receptors is p53
independent
There are numerous reports that suggest p53 can induce
death receptors (10, 29). Whether DBA-induced induction of
TRAIL receptors is mediated through p53 was examined using
HCT116 cell lines that lack p53. DBA induced DR5 and DR4 in
p53 parental as well as p53 knockout HCT116 cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5A, left). These results indicate
that induction of TRAIL receptors was independent of p53
expression.

Whether DBA affects the expression of p53, was also
examined. Interestingly, we found that DBA downregulated
p53 at higher doses (Fig. 5A, right) further suggesting that
induction of DR4/5 is p53-independent.
DBA inhibited activation of Akt
It has been reported that inhibition of Akt1/2 activation are
needed to cause TRAIL-induced apoptosis (19, 30). Therefore,
we determined whether DBA suppressed activation of Akt1/2.
We found that DBA suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt1/2,
at even its lower dose 10mmol/L (Fig 5B, left).
DBA-induced upregulation of TRAIL receptors is not
mediated through MAPK
Several reports suggest that JNK and ERK could mediate
induction of TRAIL receptors (31). To determine whether DBA
can activate ERK and JNK, cells were pretreated with DBA and

DBA Potentiates TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

then examined for the phosphorylated ERK and JNK (Fig. 5B,
left). No activation of either kinase was found. Thus induction
of TRAIL receptors by DBA did not require either of the
kinases.
DBA regulates activation of PPARg
There are numerous reports that induction of DR5 is
regulated by PPARg ligands (32, 33), so we examined whether
DBA affects the expression of PPARg. We found that DBA
upregulated the PPARg in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B,
right).
DBA-induced upregulation of TRAIL receptors is
mediated through activation of CHOP
It has been shown that the induction of DR by various
agents including PPARg agonists is mediated through activation of CHOP (32, 34–36). To determine whether DBA can
induce the expression CHOP, we pretreated cells with different concentration of DBA and assayed CHOP expression.
We found that DBA increased the expression of CHOP
(Fig. 5C).
To determine whether induction of CHOP affects the
upregulation of DR, we used siRNA specific to CHOP. The
results showed that the upregulation of DR5 but not DR4 by
DBA was effectively abolished in cells transfected with CHOP
siRNA (Fig. 5D, left), whereas treatment with control siRNA
had no effect. Thus induction of TRAIL receptors by DBA was
correlated with the expression of CHOP.
Next we determined whether suppression of CHOP by
siRNA abrogates DBA-induced apoptosis. We found that
the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was abolished
in cells transfected with CHOP siRNA (Fig. 5D, right), whereas
treatment with control siRNA had no effect. This result
suggests that CHOP, in part, play a role in TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.

DBA potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through ROS
generation
Whether ROS is needed for potentiation of TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by DBA was examined. As shown in Figure 6C,
pretreatment of cells with NAC markedly inhibited DBAinduced apoptosis enhancement, from 71% to 33%. We also
found that NAC reversed the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced
cleavage of procaspases and PARP (Fig. 6D), again suggesting
the critical role of ROS in DBA's effects on TRAIL.
DBA sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL
We also investigated whether DBA sensitizes TRAIL-resistant HT29 cancer cells to TRAIL. HT29 cells were exposed to
DBA, treated with TRAIL, and assayed for cell membrane
permeability by Live/Dead assay. We found that DBA and
TRAIL treatment alone induced 12% and 5% apoptosis,
respectively, compared with 3% in control, in HT29 cells.
Pretreatment with DBA and TRAIL in combination dramatically enhanced apoptosis, to 44% (Fig. 7A).
FACS analysis revealed that the combination of DBA and
TRAIL enhanced apoptosis 21.2% compared with 7.2% and
2.2% by DBA and TRAIL alone, respectively (Fig. 7B, left).
Next we studied cell cytotoxicity by MTT assay. We found
that HT29 cells were moderately sensitive to DBA but
resistant to TRAIL alone. However, pretreatment with
DBA significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced TRAIL-induced
cytotoxicity (Fig. 7B, right).
To determine how DBA sensitizes HT29 to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, we investigated its effect on TRAIL receptors (DR4
and DR5). HT29 cells were treated with DBA and TRAIL
separately for 24 hours. We found that DBA induced upregulation of DR5 and DR4 but TRAIL failed to (Fig. 7C), suggesting
that DBA and TRAIL in combination induced apoptosis of
HT29 cells through induction of the DR pathway.

Discussion
DBA induces TRAIL receptors through ROS-dependent
mechanism
Whether DBA has ability to generate ROS was examined by
treating HCT116 cells with DBA. The level of ROS inside the
cells were measured by FACS and found that DBA induced
ROS with increasing dose (Fig. 6A, left).
Whether DBA-induced induction of TRAIL receptors is also
regulated by ROS was examined. As shown in the Figure 6B,
pretreatment of HCT116 cells with the ROS scavenger Nacetylcysteine (NAC) reduced the DBA-induced upregulation
of DR5 and DR4 expression in a dose-dependent manner. This
suggests of ROS plays a critical role in the induction of TRAIL
receptors by DBA (Fig. 6A, right).
NAC abrogates the effect of DBA in suppression of
antiapoptotic proteins
Next we examined whether NAC abrogates DBA-induced
inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins. The results revealed that
pretreatment of NAC effectively abolished the affect of DBA in
suppression of XIAP, survivin, cFLIP, and bcl-2 (Fig. 6B). The
effect of NAC in inhibiting DBA's effect in XIAP is more
prominent than others.

In this report we describe a novel compound, DBA, that has
been shown to induce apoptosis in different tumor cells
through novel mechanisms (21, 22). We show that DBA
enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells
through a variety of mechanisms that include downregulation
of survivin, cFLIP, XIAP, and bcl-2; suppression of expression
of decoy receptor-2; induction of bax; and upregulation of
death receptors through regulation of ROS-CHOP mediated
pathway.
We found that the expression of several antiapoptotic
proteins was downregulated by DBA. Numerous studies have
shown that cFLIP overexpression confers resistance to death
receptor-mediated apoptosis (19, 20). In our study, we showed
that DBA decreased the level of cFLIP, which led to association
of death inducing complex and apoptosis. How DBA downregulates these proteins, is unclear at present but several
possible mechanisms could account for this. Various PPARg agonists such as 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J (2)
have been shown to regulate antiapoptotic proteins including
survivin (37) and cFLIP (38). They all contain a,
bunsaturated dienone and inhibit ubiquitin isopeptidase

Figure 6. DBA induces generation of ROS and DBA-induced upregulation of DR5 and DR4 was mediated by ROS. A, HCT116 (1106 cells) cells were
labeled with DCF-DA, treated with indicated concentration of DBA for 1 hour and examined for ROS production by flow cytometer (left). HCT116 cells
(1106 cells) were pretreated with various concentrations of NAC for 1 hour and then the cells were treated with 15 mmol/L DBA for 24 hours.
Whole-cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting (right). B, NAC reverses the DBA-induced inhibition of antiapoptotic proteins. HCT116
cells were pretreated with NAC for 1 hour and then treated with 15 mmol/L DBA for 24 hours. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to
Western blotting. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with b-actin antibody to verify equal protein loading. C,NAC reverses cell death induced by
combination of DBA and TRAIL. HCT116 cells were pretreated with NAC (10 mmol/L) for 1 hour and then treated with 15 mmol/L DBA for 12 hours.
After washing with PBS cells were treated with TRAIL (25 ng/mL) for 24 hours. Cell death was determined by the Live/Dead assay. Percent dead cells are
mentioned below the photo. D, NAC inhibited caspase activation and PARP cleavage induced by combination of TRAIL and DBA. HCT116 cells were
treated with NAC, DBA, and TRAIL as indicated above. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using the relevant antibodies.

dependent on the PPAR-g (39). We did find indeed that DBA
induced PPAR-g.
Our results also show that another potential mechanism
by which DBA could enhance the effects of TRAIL is through
induction of death receptors. The effect of DBA was more
pronounced on DR5 than on DR4. We found silencing the
gene of these 2 receptors abolished the effect of DBA on

TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting that induction of these
receptors is a critical event in the sensitization of cells to the
cytokine. We found that the silencing of DR5 had more
pronounced effect on apoptosis than silencing of DR4. These
results are consistent to that reported previously (24, 40).
That DR4 and DR5 can regulate TRAIL-induced apoptosis
differentially, has been reported (41–43). How DBA induces
these receptors was also investigated in detail. Although
several reports suggest that induction of death receptors is
mediated through expression of p53 (10, 29, 44), we found, by
treating p53-knock-out cells with DBA that these receptors are
induced through a p53-independent mechanism. In addition,
DBA did not upregulate but only slightly downregulated the
expression of p53 at 20 mmol/L. These results are in agreement
with those reported previously (23). Although some have found
that induction of JNK or ERK is needed for induction of death
receptors(45); however, we found that DBA had no effect on
either of the kinases at 20 mmol/L.
When examined for the role of CHOP/GADD153 in induction of death receptors, we found that CHOP plays a critical
role in the expression of death receptors induced by DBA.
First, we showed that DBA induced the expression of CHOP.
Second, silencing of the gene for CHOP abolished the effect of

www.aacrjournals.org

DBA on induction of death receptors. Third, silencing of CHOP
also abolished the effect of DBA on apoptosis by TRAIL. Taken
together, this evidence indicates that CHOP plays an essential
role in the action of DBA. Like DBA, other a, bunsaturated
dienones such as PGJ2(32) and Curcumin (46) induce death
receptors through activation of CHOP. In addition induction
of TRAIL receptors by endoplasmic reticulum stress (36);
rottlerin (35), and WIN (39) is also mediated through CHOP
expression.
We also found that induction of ROS is critical for the
sensitization of cells to TRAIL by DBA. Our results show that
first, DBA induced ROS in a dose-dependent manner; second,
quenching of ROS by NAC abolished the DBA-induced expression of death receptors; third, quenching of ROS also abrogated the effect of DBA on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus all
these evidence suggest the role of ROS in action of DBA. These
results are in agreement with those reported previously on
induction of death receptors by Curcumin (46), PGJ2(32),
proteasome inhibitors (47), withaferin (34), and zerumbone
(24).
It is known that many tumor cell types including HT29 are
completely resistant to TRAIL -induced apoptosis (48). Our
results revealed that DBA sensitized the TRAIL-resistant HT29

cancer cells and this was accompanied by induction of the
TRAIL receptors. Thus DBA has potential to enhance the
effects of TRAIL in both TRAIL-resistant and—sensitive tumor
cells. We also found that DBA inhibits the activity of GSK3beta and this could also lead to sensitization of tumors to
TRAIL as reported previously (25, 26). Liao et al. (25) reported
that resistance of prostate cancer cells to TRAIL was abolished
by inhibition of GSK-3beta. Akt1/2 also play important role in
developing resistance to TRAIL (30). In our study, inhibition of
activated Akt1/2 by DBA could sensitize TRAIL-resistant cells
and induce apoptosis. Overall, our study shows that DBA
could potentiate the apoptotic effects of TRAIL through
activation of multiple mechanisms. Although, animal study
have shown that DBA at a dose of 40 mg/kg/d (i.p.) significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma in mice (22); therefore, furthermore animal studies are warranted in
combination of DBA with TRAIL and agonistic antibody to
TRAIL receptor. Whether DBA induces TRAIL receptors
through the upregulation of ROS and CHOP, as shown here,
in the animals models will be determined in the future.
