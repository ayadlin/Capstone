Abstract
There is little information on early molecular events in the
development of N -nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)–
induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis and of the effects of
chemopreventive agents on these events. In this study, we
identified genes in rat esophagus that were differentially
expressed in response to short-term NMBA treatment and
modulated by cotreatment with phenylethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC). Rats were fed AIN-76A diet or AIN-76A diet
containing PEITC for 3 weeks. During the 3rd week of dietary
treatment, they were administered three s.c. doses of NMBA
(0.5 mg/kg body weight). Rats were sacrificed 24 h after the
last treatment; esophagi were excised and processed for
histologic grading, microarray and real-time PCR analysis.
Histopathologic analysis showed that treatment of rats with
PEITC had a protective effect on NMBA-induced preneoplastic
lesions in the rat esophagus. We identified 2,261 genes that
were differentially expressed in the NMBA-treated versus
control esophagi and 1,936 genes in the PEITC + NMBA versus
NMBA-treated esophagi. The intersection of these two sets
resulted in the identification of 1,323 genes in NMBA-treated
esophagus, the vast majority of which were modulated by
PEITC to near-normal levels of expression. Measured changes
in the expression levels of eight selected genes were validated
using real-time PCR. Results from 12 microarrays indicated
that PEITC treatment had a genome-wide modulating effect
on NMBA-induced gene expression. Samples obtained from
animals treated with PEITC alone or cotreated with PEITC +
NMBA were more similar to controls than to samples treated
with NMBA alone. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6484–92]

Introduction
Esophageal cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal
malignancy and the sixth most frequent cause of cancer death in
the world (1). Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant
histologic subtype worldwide, and this disease has a high mortality
rate (2, 3). Statistics indicate the insidious nature of this
malignancy and support the need to develop improved treatment
and preventive strategies. Chemoprevention can play an integral
role in the overall strategy toward reducing the incidence of cancer,

and is a potentially viable approach to reduce the risk of
esophageal cancer in high-risk individuals (3).
Recent studies provide evidence that many daily consumed
dietary compounds possess cancer-preventative properties (4, 5).
These properties include the induction of cellular detoxifying and
antioxidant enzymes, which protect against cellular damage,
caused by carcinogens and endogenously generated reactive
oxygen species. These compounds can also affect cell death
signaling pathways, resulting in reduced proliferation of tumor
cells. Because the process of cancer development comprises three
different stages (i.e., initiation, promotion, and progression), many
potential chemopreventive agents can be categorized broadly as
blocking agents, which impede the initiation stage, or suppressing
agents, which arrest or reverse the promotion and progression
stages, presumably by affecting crucial factors that control cell
proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and/or apoptosis (4).
Numerous cancer cell lines and animal tumor models have been
used to evaluate the chemopreventive effects and elucidate the
mechanisms of cancer prevention by various phytochemicals, such
as flavonoids from soybeans, isothiocyanates from cruciferous
vegetables, resveratrol from grapes, curcumin from tumeric
powder, and polyphenols from green and black tea (5, 6).
Isothiocyanates are potent inhibitors of carcinogenesis in
rodents induced by a number of chemical carcinogens, including
the esophageal carcinogen, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA;
ref. 7). These compounds, including phenylethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC), are found at high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as
watercress, garden cress, cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli (8).
Inhibition of P450 enzymes and induction of phase II enzymes,
among other effects, have been implicated in the chemopreventive
action of isothiocyanates (9, 10). The chemopreventive properties
of PEITC in animal models have been extensively studied (7).
PEITC is a potent inhibitor of lung tumor formation by 4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone in mice and rats,
esophageal tumor formation in rats treated with NMBA, and liver
tumors in rats treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine (11–13).
Several investigations suggest that certain nitrosamine carcinogens present in tobacco smoke and in the diet are causative
agents for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in humans and in
rodents (14–17). The sequence of histopathologic changes in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma development typically
involves hyperplasia, mild to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ,
and, finally, invasive carcinoma. Genetic events that accompany
such changes frequently include disruption of cell cycle control in
the G1 phase, activation of oncogenes, and inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes (18). The rat esophagus, in which tumors can be
induced by multiple nitrosamine carcinogens such as NMBA, has
been used extensively for studies of the molecular mechanism(s)

involved in the development of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma as well as for identification of chemopreventive agents
for this disease (13, 19–21). NMBA requires cytochrome P450
enzyme (CYP)–dependent activation to induce tumors in the rat
esophagus (15, 22–24).
In a typical F-344 rat esophagus bioassay, NMBA (0.25–0.5 mg/kg
body weight) is administered s.c. either thrice a week for 5 weeks or
once per week for 15 weeks (25). This treatment results in a 100%
tumor incidence within 20 weeks after the first injection of NMBA.
Most tumors at this point are classified histopathologically as
papillomas. Several preneoplastic esophageal lesions, including
simple hyperplasia, leukoplakia, and dysplasia, are also observed
at 20 weeks. These lesions, which can be quantitated by routine
histopathology, closely mimic lesions observed in the human
esophagus; however, only dysplastic lesions are known to progress
into carcinoma (26). We have reported that the conversion of
preneoplastic lesions to papillomas in this model is accompanied
by multiple molecular changes in oncogenes, suppressor genes,
growth factors, growth factor receptors, cyclins, cell adhesion
molecules, and cell signaling molecules (25). To date, however,
there is little information on early molecular events that occur
during treatment of the rat esophagus with NMBA, and whether
these events can be modulated with chemopreventive agents. In
the present study, DNA microarray analysis was used to identify
genes in the rat esophagus that are differentially expressed in
response to short-term NMBA treatment, and whether the
expression of these genes can be modulated by PEITC. Our results
suggest that PEITC treatment has a genome-wide modulating
effect on NMBA-induced gene expression in the esophagus.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. NMBA was purchased from Ash Stevens, Inc., and PEITC was
from Aldrich Chemical Company.
Animals and diet. All experimental protocols were in accordance with
NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of The Ohio State University. The animals were housed and
maintained as described before (23).
Experimental procedure. Rats were randomized into four experimental
groups of nine animals each. Rats in groups 1 and 3 were placed on control
AIN-76A diet and those in groups 2 and 4 were given AIN-76A diet plus
5 Amol PEITC. During the 3rd week of dietary treatment, group 1 (vehicle
control) and group 2 (PEITC control) rats each received three s.c. injections
of 20% DMSO in water (the vehicle for NMBA). During the same week,
group 3 (NMBA control) and group 4 (PEITC + NMBA) rats were given three
s.c. injections of NMBA (0.5 mg/kg body weight). All rats were sacrificed
24 h after the last NMBA treatment, and their esophagi were excised,
opened longitudinally, and sectioned into two parts. One part was fixed for
at least 24 h in buffered formalin and then placed in PBS for histopathologic
studies. The other part was stripped of the submucosal and muscularis
layers, added to 1 mL of TRIzol solution, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at 80jC until extraction of RNA. Food intake and body weights
were recorded weekly.
Histologic grading of NMBA-induced preneoplastic lesions. One-half
of each formalin-fixed esophagus from six rats per group was cut into thirds
and embedded in paraffin with the epithelium uppermost. Serial 4-Am
sections were cut and mounted on Superfrost plus slides (Histotechniques
Laboratories). An H&E-stained slide was made from each esophagus of
animals in all groups and scanned at 100 magnification. Each viewing
field was categorized into one of three histologic categories: normal
epithelium, epithelial hyperplasia, and low-grade dysplasia (12, 13).
RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and cleaned using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The integrity of

www.aacrjournals.org

the RNA samples was checked by resolving the total RNA on an agarose gel
and visualizing the 18S and 28S ribosomal bands after staining the gel with
ethidium bromide. Samples were aliquoted and frozen at 80jC.
Microarray analysis. Further quality control checks of total RNA from
each biological sample was made using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the
6000 Nano Assay kit (Agilent Technologies), and analyzed for purity using a
spectrophotometer; a 260/280 ratio in the range of 1.9 to 2.2 was considered
acceptable. Samples having apparent degradation were excluded from the
study. To account for biological variation, we used a pooling strategy to
enable the inclusion of samples from numerous animals. Three replicate
microarrays were completed for each of the four treatments (control,
PEITC, NMBA, and PEITC + NMBA) for a total of 12 microarrays. Each
microarray was hybridized using a pooled RNA sample, and each pool was
created from equal amounts of total RNA from two or three independent
RNA samples, representing individual animals. Each of these samples was
obtained from a different animal, and no sample was included in more than
one pool. This approach provides appropriate biological replication within
the constraints of a limiting number of microarrays (27). In total, samples
from nine animals per group were pooled for control, NMBA, PEITC, and
PEITC + NMBA microarrays. To facilitate comparisons of gene expression
across all treatments, we used a reference design in which each microarray
was cohybridized with a common reference sample labeled with Cy3, and
RNA from the treatment pool was labeled with Cy5. Stratagene’s Universal
Rat reference RNA was used as the common reference in all microarrays.
The microarrays used were Agilent Rat Whole-Genome oligonucleotide
arrays (Agilent Technologies). Each array included 60-mer oligonucleotide
probes for over 41,000 genes and transcripts.
Labeling and hybridization. An aliquot of 500 ng of total RNA from
each pool was labeled using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear
Amplification Kit per the vendor’s protocol. Labeled cRNA was purified
using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For each hybridization reaction,
0.75 Ag of Cyanine3-labeled cRNA and 0.75 Ag of Cyanine5-labeled cRNA
were mixed together and allowed to cohybridize on the array for 17 h at
60jC. After hybridization, the microarrays were washed in SSC, 0.005%
Triton X-102 for 10 min at room temperature, then washed in 0.1 SSC,
0.005% Triton X-102 for 5 min on ice and dried according to Agilent’s
protocol. Slides were immediately scanned with an Agilent G2565AA
dual-laser scanner. Photomultiplier tube settings were at 100% for both
channels. Tiff images were analyzed using Agilent feature extraction
software (version 7.5) to obtain fluorescent intensities for each spot on the
arrays. Local background subtraction was done for each feature (spot) on
the arrays, and Linear&Lowess normalization was done on the backgroundsubtracted intensity values (28). Features flagged as population outliers or
saturated in both channels were excluded from further analysis. Log10 ratios
representing gene expression relative to the common reference were
derived for each probe on the array. All microarray data are available from
the Gene Expression Omnibus database using series accession number
GSE6917.3
Data analysis. Normalized data for each microarray was imported into
Rosetta Resolver for analysis (version 5.1.0.1.23, Rosetta Biosoftware).
ANOVA was done on log ratios using the Rosetta Resolver error model
and weighting, as described by Weng et al. (29). One-way ANOVA was used
to identify genes with a significant treatment effect. A P value cutoff of
0.001 was used to determine statistical significance in each treatment
comparison, providing a false-discovery rate below 5% for each test.
Statistically significant genes were further filtered to identify those with a
minimum 1.5-fold change. Clustering and principal components analysis
was done using GeneSpring GX version 7.2 (Agilent Technologies). Gene
ontology and pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes were done
using the Gene Ontology Consortium designations and DAVID (30, 31).4
Real-time PCR. Microarray results were confirmed by comparison with
mRNA levels obtained by quantitative reverse transcription PCR using

was used for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Comparative
RT-PCR for Gst1a2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) and
mitogen activated protein kinase 6 (Mapk6) was done using SYBR green
(Applied Biosystems). Primers for Gst1a2 ( forward 5¶-CAGGAGTGGAGTTTGATGAG-3¶, reverse 5¶-GCGATGTAGTTGAGAATGG-3¶) and Pcna ( forward
5¶-GGACCTTAGCCATATTGGAG-3¶, reverse 5¶-TCTATGGACACAGCTTCCT-3¶)
were designed using PerlPrimer software and obtained on request
(Integrated DNA Technologies). Mapk6 primers were obtained from
SuperArray Bioscience Corp. Each sample was assayed in triplicate for
each gene. Reverse transcription was carried out using 2 Ag of total RNA
following the protocol for the Taqman Reverse Transcription Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 100 ng of RNA converted into cDNA of each
sample was used. Primer optimization was done to determine the minimum
primer concentration giving the minimum threshold cycle (C t). Primer
optimization was accomplished using varying concentrations of forward
and reverse primers and 100 ng of cDNA of Universal Rat Reference Sample
(Stratagene), and 1 Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). One
hundred nanograms of cDNA of each sample, 1 Sybr Green PCR Master
Mix, and primers in optimal concentrations were then used for the RT-PCR
in a total reaction mixture of 25 AL. Assays were completed using the ABI
Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Initial setup

for the thermal cycler conditions were 2 min at 50jC followed by 10 min at
95jC. After initial setup, 40 cycles were run with 15 s at 95jC followed by
1 min at 60jC. The expressions of genes of interest were normalized against
internal control gene Rps11 (ABI Taqman).
Relative expression was calculated as 2 DDC t, where DC t was determined
by subtracting the average normalization C t from the average target C t
value. The DDC t was then obtained by the difference in DC t values for the
control group versus treated group.

Results
Effect of PEITC on preneoplastic lesions in NMBA-treated
rat esophagus. To determine the effects of dietary PEITC on
microscopic NMBA-induced preneoplastic lesions, we used a
histologic grading scheme as described (Fig. 1A; refs. 12, 13).
The effects of vehicle, PEITC and NMBA alone, and PEITC in
combination with NMBA, on the development of preneoplastic
lesions were evaluated. Microscopic lesion data were compared
using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test
(P < 0.01). The percentages of each viewing field exhibiting either
normal epithelium, epithelial hyperplasia, or low-grade dysplasia in

esophagi from vehicle control rats were 81%, 19%, and 0%, respectively; in the NMBA-treated group, 19%, 72%, and 9%, respectively;
and in the PEITC + NMBA–treated group, 76%, 24%, and 0%,
respectively. Esophagi treated with PEITC alone were histologically
similar to vehicle controls. Combined treatment with PEITC +
NMBA reduced the formation of NMBA-induced preneoplastic
lesions (P < 0.01), suggesting a protective effect of dietary PEITC
(Fig. 1B).
Genes differentially expressed in response to dietary PEITC
or NMBA and modulated by cotreatment with PEITC + NMBA.
The effect of vehicle, PEITC, NMBA alone, and PEITC + NMBA on
changes in gene expression in the esophagus were evaluated.
Initially, we sought to identify genes that were differentially
expressed in response to dietary PEITC alone. ANOVA was used
to identify genes that were differentially expressed in PEITCtreated animals versus vehicle controls. Using replicate microarray
data and a P value cutoff of 0.001, 832 genes were found to be
differentially expressed in PEITC-treated esophagus ( false discovery rate 4.9%). To reduce the false positives, we filtered this set of
genes by selecting those that had a minimum 1.5-fold change. This
resulted in the identification of 251 genes that were differentially
expressed by dietary PEITC (Supplementary Table S1). To identify
biological processes and molecular functions associated with this
set of genes, we analyzed the set with DAVID and the lists were
sorted by the DAVID P value (data not shown). In the list, the
expression levels of three genes, all thioredoxin-related and
associated with oxidative reductase activity, were markedly upregulated in PEITC-treated esophagus (Table 1). This category of
genes had a DAVID P value of 0.005, and their up-regulation may

provide an elevated capability of the esophagus to respond to
oxidative stress. Another gene category that was affected was
‘‘protein metabolism’’ (Table 1). This category included 17 genes,
most of which were down-regulated. In contrast, protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type E (PTPRE) was induced 8-fold. PTPRE
inhibits events downstream of extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK), including transcriptional activation mediated by
c-Jun (32). The list of 251 genes also contains numerous
uncharacterized genes and expressed sequence tags (Supplementary Table S1).
Next, we applied ANOVA to identify genes that were differentially
expressed in response to NMBA treatment only. Using replicate
microarray data and a P value cutoff of 0.001, we identified 3,752
genes that were differentially expressed in response to NMBA. To
further reduce false positives, we filtered this set of genes by
selecting those that had a minimum 1.5-fold change. This resulted
in 2,261 genes that were differentially expressed by NMBA
treatment (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S2).
The same approach was used to identify esophageal genes that
were differentially expressed when comparing NMBA-treated
samples to those treated with PEITC + NMBA. Using ANOVA with
a P value V0.001, 3,615 genes were found to be differentially
expressed in these two sets. Using a 1.5-fold change cutoff resulted
in 1,936 genes that were differentially expressed (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Table S3). To identify genes that were differentially
expressed in response to NMBA treatment and modulated by
cotreatment with PEITC, we determined the intersection of the
2,261 genes found in the NMBA versus control comparison and
the 1,936 genes from the PEITC + NMBA versus NMBA set. The

NMBA treatment and also differentially expressed comparing NMBA to PEITC + NMBA treatment. B, data points reflect the mean value for three replicate arrays.
Y axis, normalized gene expression levels in which the expression value for each treatment of a gene was divided by the average of all treatments for that gene.
C, to provide a comparison of genome-wide expression changes for different treatments, we applied principal components analysis to all of the 12 microarrays used in
the study. Each of the 12 microarrays used were clustered with the axes representing the first three principal components of gene expression, based on the
expression of all 41,070 probes on the arrays. NMBA-treated samples ( ) are distinct in global gene expression whereas those samples treated with PEITC alone ( ) or
cotreated with PEITC + NMBA ( ) are clustered near the vehicle controls ( ).

intersection of these two sets resulted in 1,323 genes (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Table S4). Figure 2B shows the gene expression
profiles for the 1,323 genes when viewed across the four treatments,
including controls, using averaged data for treatment replicates.
The Y axis represents normalized gene expression levels in which
the expression value for each treatment of a gene was divided
by the average of all treatments for that gene. The profiles revealed
that NMBA treatment alone results in multiple large changes in
gene expression, and that the vast majority of these genes are
returned to near-normal expression levels in the animals treated
with both PEITC and NMBA.
Because PEITC is known to influence the metabolism of NMBA,
we attempted to identify the genes for phase I (CYPs) and phase II
detoxifying enzymes that might be influenced by PEITC in NMBAtreated rat esophagus. Genes encoding for CYP2A2 and CYP3A13
were up-regulated 2-fold in esophagi treated with NMBA alone
and down-regulated by treatment with PEITC (Table 2). Their
expression in the esophagus of animals cotreated with PEITC +
NMBA was comparable with vehicle. However, CYP2A2 and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

CYP3A13 have not been shown to be involved in NMBA metabolism
in any tissue. We also noticed that the probe for Cyp2a2 was
misannotated by the array manufacturer as it targets a region
upstream of the coding sequence; thus, Cyp2a2 requires further
validation. The expression of Cyp2a3, which has been reported to
be involved in NMBA metabolism in rat esophagus, was not altered
by treatment with NMBA. Several genes associated with glutathione
S-transferase (GST) activities were down-regulated by NMBA treatment. Dietary PEITC up-regulated the expression of these genes,
and cotreatment with PEITC + NMBA led to expression levels that
were comparable with vehicle control (Table 2). PEITC treatment,
therefore, restored normal levels of expression of these genes in
NMBA-treated rat esophagus.

PEITC alone did not influence the expression of these genes, and
treatment with PEITC returned the expression levels of these genes
to near normal in NMBA-treated esophagus.
Principal components analysis has been widely used in the
analysis of microarray data (33). Principal components analysis is a
dimensional reduction technique allowing samples to be compared
and clustered within a three-dimensional space in which each axis
represents a linear combination of genes that best account for the
variance among the treated samples. The distance between
esophagus samples plotted in this space represents the difference
in overall gene expression between the samples. To provide a
comparison of genome-wide expression changes for the different
treatments, we applied principal components analysis to all 12
microarrays in the study, using the expression values for all 41,070
genes on the array (Fig. 2C). The first three principal components
were selected to enable visualization of the array data in three
dimensions. Each point represents one microarray and the data are

color coded to reflect treatment type. The axes in Fig. 2C represent
the first three principal components of gene expression plotted on
the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. The variance accounted for by
each axis is 30.71%, 17.08%, and 13.03%, respectively for X, Y, and Z.
The data reveal that the esophagi from PEITC-treated animals were
most similar to vehicle control esophagi in terms of global gene
expression. NMBA-treated esophagi are well separated from all
other samples indicating distinct differences in global gene
expression. Importantly, the esophagus samples obtained from
animals cotreated with PEITC and NMBA are more similar to
vehicle controls than they are to NMBA treatment alone. This
suggests that PEITC treatment has a genome-wide modulating
effect on NMBA-induced gene expression in the rat esophagus.
Ontology and pathway analysis. Biological processes and
pathways perturbed by NMBA treatment and modulated by PEITC
in NMBA-treated rats were identified using ontology analysis of the
set of 1,323 genes obtained from the intersection of ANOVA sets
(Fig. 2A). Analysis of the Gene Ontology Consortium designation of

involved in signal transduction and apoptosis pathways, such as
Mapk6, Junb, Casp3; and genes associated with early events in
tumor development, such as Ccnd1 and Pcna. These genes were
chosen because they are known to play an important role in
NMBA-induced carcinogenesis and in chemoprevention by PEITC.
However, in the interest of space, we provide data from three of
the eight genes analyzed (i.e., Gst1a2, Pcna, and Mapk6; Fig. 3).
Data from these genes were chosen because their expression as
determined by microarray was perturbed by NMBA treatment and
modulated by PEITC + NMBA cotreatment (P V 0.05), and are
also known to play an important role either in NMBA-induced
carcinogenesis or in chemoprevention by PEITC. The expressions
of these genes were normalized against expression of the
endogenous gene, Rps11, because microarray analysis revealed
that expression of Rps11 remained unchanged with all treatments
when compared with other housekeeping genes such as Hprt, ActB,
or Gapdh. A comparison of the fold changes measured by the
microarray and RT-PCR assays is shown in Fig. 3. For each gene
tested, the RT-PCR results confirmed gene expression changes that
were observed by microarray. RT-PCR assays showed that NMBA
treatment up-regulated the expressions of Pcna and Mapk6 by
3.6- and 9-fold, respectively, whereas Gst1a2 was down-regulated
by 5.9-fold. In contrast, dietary-PEITC up-regulated expression of

provided a list of statistically significant processes (P V 0.05)
represented in the set of 1,323 genes (33). Table 3 lists the
categories ordered by P value. The most significant categories are
cell cycle (30 genes), cell proliferation (36 genes), and cell death
(22 genes). Gene expression data for the genes in each of these
categories and fold changes in NMBA-, PEITC-, and PEITC +
NMBA–treated esophagi relative to vehicle controls are shown in
Supplementary Tables S5 to S7. In some cases, there are multiple
probes for a given gene. In these cases, the redundant probes
typically report very consistent fold changes. For example, in
Table S4, there are four probes listed for Hspa8 (i.e., heat shock
70 kDa protein 8). Each of these probes had statistically significant
changes in expression, and the four probes each show an
approximate 2-fold induction of the gene in esophagi with NMBA
alone and a return to near-normal levels in esophagi treated with
PEITC + NMBA.
In general, the data reveal that esophageal gene expression levels
for the biological processes identified by Gene Ontology are greatly
perturbed in response to NMBA treatment but are near-normal
when cotreated with PEITC.

PEITC Protects NMBA-Induced Cytotoxicity in Rat Esophagus

Gst1a2 and down-regulated Mapk6 by 2-fold. Cotreatment with
PEITC + NMBA reduced the expressions of Pcna and Mapk6, and
up-regulated the expression of GSTs.
These results suggest that PEITC may abrogate NMBA-induced
changes by (a) inhibiting NMBA metabolism through CYPs, (b)
enhancing detoxification by induction of GST activity, and/or
(c) by interfering in signal transduction cascades involved in
carcinogenesis.

Discussion
The major goal of this study was to assess early changes in genes
involved in NMBA-induced cytotoxic/carcinogenic events in rat
esophagus and the effects of the chemopreventive agent, PEITC, on
these events. Histopathologic data showed that treatment of rats
with PEITC alone led to very few, if any, changes in the esophagus
relative to rats treated with vehicle only. In contrast, treatment
with NMBA led to basal cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, apoptosis,
and inflammatory changes in the esophagus. The histologic
appearance of the esophagus in rats treated with PEITC + NMBA
was more normal than in esophagus treated with NMBA only.
Microarray analyses identified multiple genes that were differentially expressed by short-term treatment of the esophagus with
NMBA, and many of these were modulated by cotreatment with
dietary PEITC. There was a strong correlation between the ability
of PEITC to prevent NMBA-induced morphologic changes in the
esophagus and its effects on overall gene expression.
NMBA is bioactivated by CYPs into metabolites that elicit DNA
damage through the formation of O 6-methylguanine adducts
(22, 24). The specific CYP(s) responsible for NMBA metabolism in
the rat have not been fully identified; however, two candidate
enzymes are CYP2A3, present in the esophagus, lung, and nasal
mucosa, and CYP2E1, found primarily in liver (34, 35). Earlier, we
showed that PEITC markedly reduces the levels of O 6-methylguanine from NMBA in rat esophagus (36). Because PEITC is a known
inhibitor of CYP activity, we thought that the use of DNA array
analysis would assist in the further identification of specific P450s
involved in NMBA metabolism in the rat esophagus. We found, for
the first time, that the expression levels of CYP2a2 and CYP3a9
were up-regulated by NMBA treatment of rat esophagus, and that
cotreatment with PEITC lowered the expression of these genes to
control levels. Differential expression of Cyp2a2 in the esophagus
was confirmed by RT-PCR. These data suggest that Cyp2a2 and
Cyp3a9 may be important for NMBA metabolism in rat esophagus,
and they may be targets for PEITC inhibition. These observations
require confirmation in further studies, however, because both
genes have been reported to be expressed predominately in the
liver (37, 38). Interestingly, as reported earlier by our laboratory,
treatment with NMBA did not result in significant changes in the
expression of the Cyp2a3 gene in the rat esophagus, suggesting
that Cyp2a3 is either noninducible or its constitutive levels are
sufficient for metabolism of NMBA in the esophagus.
Phase II enzymes are important for detoxifying carcinogens
through conjugation with acceptor molecules such as cellular
glutathione, glucuronic acid, and sulfates (39, 40). Although the role
of phase II enzymes in the metabolism of NMBA in the rat
esophagus has not been fully elucidated, there is evidence of the
formation of glucuronide conjugates of NMBA-derived metabolites
in rodent tissues (41). In the present study, NMBA treatment of
rat esophagus led to reduced expression levels of several GSTs,
including Gsta1, Gsta2, and Gstt2 (Table 2). In contrast, the

www.aacrjournals.org

expression of these genes was significantly up-regulated by dietary
PEITC alone. Importantly, PEITC modulated the expression levels
of these GSTs in NMBA-treated esophagus to levels equal to or
greater than seen in vehicle controls. These results indicate the
important role of PEITC in restoring the activities of detoxifying
enzymes in the esophagus. We also showed recently that PEITC
induces GST activity in the rat liver (23).
A portion of the chemopreventive effects of PEITC against
NMBA-induced toxicity in the rat esophagus appears to be
associated with blocking the metabolic activation of NMBA by
CYPs (phase I inhibition) coupled with induction of the phase II
detoxifying GSTs and UDP-glucuronic acid transferases. Because
NMBA is administered s.c., much of the compound likely
encounters hepatic cells before reaching the esophagus. Recently,
we showed the ability of PEITC to induce GST activity in the rat
liver, which may also be an important mechanism for reducing its
carcinogenic effect in the esophagus (23). Interestingly, we also
found that NMBA is metabolically activated in rat liver, but this
activation was not affected by dietary PEITC.
Cellular functions in the rat esophagus that were perturbed by
NMBA and also modulated by cotreatment with PEITC included
genes associated with cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death
(Table 2). Some of the genes induced in the esophagus by shortterm NMBA treatment were Ran (member of Ras oncogene family),
Mapk6, Jun b, fos11, cyclins (cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and
cyclin G1), Cdkn1a, Pcna, interleukins (Il18 and Il1b), Tieg, T-cell
associated gene (Tdag ), Casp3, and Bcl-2 binding component 3
(Bbc3; see Supplementary Tables S5–S7). Dietary PEITC reduced
the differential expression of these genes in NMBA-treated
esophagus to levels comparable with control esophagus. Because
the principal regulatory events leading to mammalian cell
proliferation and differentiation occur in the transition from G0
to G1 and/or at the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, the deregulated
expression of G1 or G1-S phase cyclins or their related cyclindependent kinases (CDK) could cause loss of cell cycle control and
thus enhance carcinogenesis. Amplification and overexpression of
cyclin D1 has been reported in several human tumors including
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (42).
Our laboratory reported overexpression of cyclins D1 and E as well
as PCNA in NMBA-treated rat esophagus, and we suggested that
overexpression of these genes are relatively early events in tumor
development (43–45). Results in the present study confirm these
observations in that NMBA activation of cyclins and their related
CDKs, as well as PCNA, occurred after only 1 week of NMBA
treatment. Interestingly, dietary PEITC completely reduced the
overexpression of these genes to control levels in NMBA-treated
esophagus.
Apoptosis of preinitiated and/or neoplastic cells represents a
protective mechanism against neoplastic transformation. In the
present study, the expression of the proapoptotic gene Casp3 was
up-regulated by NMBA treatment consistent with our observation
of an apparent increase in the apoptotic rate in NMBA-treated rat
esophagus. This increase may have been due to the observed
cellular toxicity associated with carcinogen treatment. Dietary
PEITC down-regulated Casp3 in NMBA-treated rat esophagus,
whereas it up-regulated GST gene expression. This might be
protective because it would enhance the detoxification of the
carcinogen and lead to a reduced rate of NMBA-induced
cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Numerous studies have shown,
however, that PEITC enhances Casp3 expression and apoptosis
in human cancer cell lines and in transgenic animal tumor models

(5, 46, 47). This is the opposite of what would be expected from our
results. However, the effects of PEITC in tumor cell cultures and in
transgenic animals may be different because in these systems, cell
cycle events and rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis are
markedly deregulated, and the induction of Casp3 and apoptosis by
PEITC would be protective.
Considerable evidence suggests that the chemopreventive effects
of a single compound are optimal when the compound is capable
of modulating multiple cellular events involved in the carcinogenesis processes (48). In this regard, isothiocyanates, including
PEITC, modulate carcinogen metabolism and inhibit tumor
progression by causing cell cycle arrest, inhibiting cell growth,
and stimulating apoptosis. Our studies suggest that short-term
treatment with NMBA induces early changes in molecular events

that likely play a crucial role in cellular cytotoxicity and, possibly,
the initial development of esophageal tumorigenesis. Dietary
PEITC almost completely blocked many of these NMBA-induced
events, which is consistent with its remarkable inhibitory effect on
NMBA-esophageal tumorigenesis (36, 49).
