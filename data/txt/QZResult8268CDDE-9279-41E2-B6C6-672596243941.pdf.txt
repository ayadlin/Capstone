BACKGROUND: Randomized trials report equivalent efficacy among various combinations of platinum-based regimens in advanced
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Their relative effectiveness and comparability based on squamous versus nonsquamous histology is uncertain. METHODS: The authors used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data to identify first-line chemotherapy agents administered to Medicare beneficiaries with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC diagnosed from 2000 to 2007.
Overall survival was compared between patients who received the 3 most common regimens: carboplatin-paclitaxel, carboplatingemcitabine, and carboplatin-docetaxel. Stratified analyses distinguished between the outcomes of patients with squamous versus
nonsquamous cell histology. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score analyses facilitated adjustment for
imbalance in measurable patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 15,318 patients who received first-line chemotherapy, 43.1% received
carboplatin-paclitaxel, 14.3% received carboplatin-gemcitabine, 8.5% received carboplatin-docetaxel, and 34.1% received other regimens. The median survival was 8.0 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5-17.4 months) for carboplatin-paclitaxel, 7.3 months (IQR,
3.4-15.2 months) for carboplatin-gemcitabine, and 7.5 months (IQR, 3.2-16.0 months) for carboplatin-docetaxel. Both multivariable
and propensity score-adjusted Cox models demonstrated a slight inferiority associated with carboplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatindocetaxel versus carboplatin-paclitaxel, with a hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.15) and 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.16), respectively, in propensity score-stratified models. Among the subgroup of 2063 patients with squamous carcinoma,
propensity score-stratified analyses had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.35) associated with
carboplatin-gemcitabine versus carboplatin-paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin-paclitaxel was associated with slightly better survival compared with carboplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatin-docetaxel within the Medicare population with advanced NSCLC, and

INTRODUCTION
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage (IIIB or IV), when a cure is rarely attainable.1 A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that chemotherapy increases overall survival without detriment to quality of life in patients with advanced NSCLC.2 In addition, chemotherapy is an effective treatment
option for elderly patients with NSCLC who have a good performance status.3-5 Single-agent chemotherapy offers a significant survival and quality-of-life advantage over best supportive care,4 and the survival benefit of platinum-based doublets is greater than singlet chemotherapy.3,5
During the early 1990s, several third-generation cytotoxics with novel mechanisms and significant activity against
NSCLC, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and irinotecan, became available.6,7 The initial platinum-based doublet with 1 of these agents to be widely adopted was carboplatin-paclitaxel,8 which has demonstrated safety
in elderly patients9 and provides efficacy similar to that of the other regimens.10 Therefore, carboplatin-paclitaxel has
become the most widely used regimen for elderly patients with NSCLC. Other platinum-based, third-generation doublets

also have been adopted.7,11 Randomized trials comparing
these doublets have reported similar efficacy, with a median survival of 8 to 10 months, and 1-year and 2-year
survival rates of 30% to 43% and 10% to 18%, respectively, in clinical trial populations that are younger and
more fit than the general population of patients who
develop advanced NSCLC.10,12-17 However, there have
been few head-to-head comparisons between carboplatinpaclitaxel and other commonly used carboplatin-based,
third-generation doublets, and information on the more
elderly patients are lacking. Only 1 randomized trial was
designed to compare carboplatin-gemcitabine with carboplatin-paclitaxel among a group of 722 patients with
advanced NSCLC, and similar overall survival was
reported.15
We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare data to compare overall survival
associated with carboplatin-paclitaxel with each of the 2
most common alternative, first-line, carboplatin-based
doublets—carboplatin-gemcitabine and carboplatindocetaxel18—in older patients with advanced NSCLC. In
the same data set, we previously examined whether adding
bevacizumab to carboplatin-paclitaxel was associated with
improved survival, and we observed similar survival outcomes between carboplatin-paclitaxel with and without
bevacizumab in older patients with advanced NSCLC.19
Therefore, we did not include carboplatin-paclitaxelbevacizumab in our current survival analysis. On the basis
of recent trials suggesting that some chemotherapy agents
(eg, pemetrexed) are associated with better survival for
patients with nonsquamous versus squamous cell
NSCLC,20-24 we examined survival by histologic subtype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data

Cohorts were assembled from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER registry linked to Medicare claims. The
SEER database includes 17 cancer registries and captures
cancer incidence for approximately 28% of the US population.25 SEER collects data on patient demographics,
cancer site, histology, stage, grade, and dates of diagnosis
and death.26 Medicare Part A and Part B claims contain
extensive service-level data for hospital inpatient and outpatient care, skilled nursing facilities, physician services,
durable medical equipment, home health agencies, and
hospice.27 SEER data for patients diagnosed from January
1, 2000 through December 31, 2007 were matched to
Medicare claims from January 1, 1999 through December
31, 2009. This study was approved by the Institutional
Cancer

Review Board at the Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer
Center.
Study Population

The study cohort included patients aged 65 years with
pathologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 who received first-line
chemotherapy. Patients who had other primary cancers
diagnosed either before or after NSCLC or who died
within 30 days of NSCLC diagnosis were excluded. To
ensure completeness of Medicare claims, patients who
were not continuously eligible for Medicare Parts A and B
or who were enrolled in a health maintenance organization at any point from diagnosis to death or at 6-month
follow-up also were excluded. Staging information was
available in SEER and was defined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual (sixth
edition).28 The cohort assembly strategy is detailed in
Figure 1.
Identification of First-Line Chemotherapy
Agents

First-line chemotherapy was defined as chemotherapy
delivered within 4 months of the NSCLC diagnosis. Specific agents were identified from Medicare outpatient,
physician, or durable medical equipment claims by using
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes
and National Drug codes. We did not include oral chemotherapy agents in our study, because Medicare Part D
was not available at the time of our analysis. The date of
the first chemotherapy claim was considered the start date
of chemotherapy. Additional agents received within 8
days of the first drug were considered as components of
the same regimen. To create a more homogenous cohort
of individuals who were likely receiving treatment with
palliative intent, we excluded any patients whose initial
chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy, defined as start dates within 8 days of each other.
Prior studies suggest that Medicare claims have high
sensitivity and specificity for identifying chemotherapy
agents.29,30
To examine patterns of care in the Medicare population, we listed all chemotherapy regimens received by at
least 20 patients with advanced NSCLC diagnosed from
2000 to 2007. The number and percentage of patients
treated with each of these regimens are presented as a pie
chart in Figure 2. Regimens received by <20 patients
were grouped into the ‘‘other’’ category.

carboplatin-paclitaxel as the treatment reference group
and compared the effectiveness of this regimen with that
of carboplatin-gemcitabine and carboplatin-docetaxel.
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, which we
measured as the number of months a patient survived
from the first date of chemotherapy to the date of either
death or the end of the observation period. The date
of death was identified from Medicare enrollment
records, which captured deaths through December 31,
2009. Patients who remained alive at the end of follow-up
2050

were censored. In addition, we examined hospitalizations
within 30 days and 60 days from the first date of chemotherapy across the 3 treatment groups.
Baseline Characteristics

Demographic and clinical data included age, sex, race/
ethnicity, marital status, geographic region, urban

before chemotherapy, and year of diagnosis according to
the categories listed in Table 1. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
other (eg, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native). Race in SEER is identified from
patients’ medical records and registration information,
and Hispanic ethnicity in SEER is determined through a
Hispanic-surname algorithm that has better sensitivity
than that recorded in Medicare data.31 Histology is well
characterized in SEER as adenocarcinoma, large cell,
squamous cell, and other histologies based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (third edition).32 We used World Health Organization criteria33 to
classify patients with squamous or nonsquamous cell carcinoma, and the latter category included adenocarcinoma,
large cell carcinoma, and other histologies. To measure
the burden of comorbidities, we applied the Deyo et al.
adaptation34 of the Charlson comorbidity index,35 modified to exclude cancer diagnoses, to Medicare inpatient,
outpatient, and physician claims during the 12-month
period extending from 13 months to 1 month before
NSCLC diagnosis using lung cancer-specific weights, as
suggested by Klabunde et al.36,37 We then classified the
comorbidity into 4 groups with scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics between the
carboplatin-paclitaxel group and each of the carboplatinCancer

gemcitabine and carboplatin-docetaxel groups using the
chi-square test. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to
estimate median survival and tested for crude differences
among the 3 groups using the log-rank test. We conducted unadjusted and multivariable Cox proportional
hazards models controlling for demographic and clinical
characteristics to examine the effect of treatment regimens
(carboplatin-gemcitabine and carboplatin-docetaxel vs
carboplatin-paclitaxel) on overall survival and to test for a
treatment-by-histology interaction. The interaction
hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the treatment effect for
patients with nonsquamous histology divided by the effect
for patients with squamous histology.21,24 In addition, we
performed subgroup analyses on patients with nonsquamous carcinoma, those with squamous cell carcinoma,
and those with stage IV disease, which was less prevalent
in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group.
We used propensity score-based approaches38 to
balance observed confounders between the carboplatinpaclitaxel and carboplatin-gemcitabine groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to generate propensity
scores, which were the predicted probabilities of receiving
carboplatin-gemcitabine versus carboplatin-paclitaxel
adjusting for measurable baseline demographic and clinical variables.39,40 Next, we divided the cohort into 5 strata
defined by quintiles of estimated propensity scores,41 and
we used P values calculated with chi-square tests to assess
whether baseline characteristics were balanced across the 2

groups within each stratum. Finally, 5 HRs were created
by applying Cox proportional hazards models within each
stratum and were combined into an overall HR for the
whole cohort.42 Cox models also were constructed that
included the propensity score as a linear predictor in the
model and used the score to create stabilized weights,
defined as the stabilized inverse probability of treatment
weighting.43,44 These analyses were repeated for the carboplatin-docetaxel group and the carboplatin-paclitaxel
group and according to histology (ie, squamous vs
nonsquamous).
Finally, we compared hospitalization rates within 30
days and 60 days of chemotherapy between patients who
received carboplatin-paclitaxel and those who received
either carboplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatin-docetaxel
using the chi-square test for the whole cohort and according to histology. The SAS statistical software package (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all
analyses. Statistical significance was set at P < .05, and all
tests were 2-tailed.
RESULTS
Description of Cohort and Pattern of Treatment

From an initial sample of 99,449 patients diagnosed
with advanced NSCLC between 2000 and 2007, 44,985
patients met the study eligibility criteria, and 15,318
received identifiable first-line chemotherapy agents (Fig.
1). The most frequently received chemotherapy regimen
was carboplatin-paclitaxel (6597 of 15,318 patients;
43.1%), followed by carboplatin-gemcitabine (2190
patients; 14.3%), and carboplatin-docetaxel (1301
patients; 8.5%) (Fig. 2). In contrast, only a small percentage of patients (690 patients; 4.5%) received cisplatin-based doublets. Even fewer patients received newer
chemotherapeutics and targeted agents, such as bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and cetuximab. The 10,064 patients
who received carboplatin-paclitaxel, carboplatin-gemcitabine, and carboplatin-docetaxel who had complete
data on patient characteristics comprised the study
cohort (Fig. 1).
Patient Characteristics

The carboplatin-gemcitabine group included a higher
proportion of patients aged 75 years (38.4% vs 34.3%;
P ¼ .002), more minorities other than black (10.7% vs
8.0%; P < .001), and more individuals who resided in
Midwest or West SEER regions (61.2% vs 53.3%;
P < .001). In addition, patients who received carboplatingemcitabine were more likely to have at least 1 comorbidity (43.4% vs 39.9%; P ¼ .02), stage IV disease (75.0% vs
Cancer

June 1, 2013

66.6%; P < .001), and nonsquamous cell histology
(82.4% vs 78.6%; P < .001), but they were less likely to
have been hospitalized within 30 days before chemotherapy (29.1% vs 33.4%; P < .001) compared with patients
in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (Table 1).
Compared with patients who received carboplatinpaclitaxel, those who received carboplatin-docetaxel were
more likely to have a lower median census tract income
(46.7% vs 39.8% in the first 2 quantiles; P < .001), to live
in the South SEER region (25.4% vs 22.3%; P < .001) or
in a rural area (11.5% vs 8.6%; P ¼ .001), to have at least
1 comorbidity (44.2% vs 39.9%; P ¼ .01), and to have
stage IV disease (70.4% vs 66.6%; P ¼ .009) (Table 1).
After adjusting for stratification of propensity scores, the
balance of observed baseline characteristics between the
carboplatin-paclitaxel group and the carboplatin-gemcitabine group or the carboplatin-docetaxel group improved.
Survival Outcomes

Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the whole cohort are
provided in Figure 3a. The median survival was 8.0
months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5-17.4 months) in
the carboplatin-paclitaxel group compared with 7.3
months (IQR, 3.4-15.2 months) in the carboplatin-gemcitabine group and 7.5 months (IQR, 3.2-16.0 months)
in the carboplatin-docetaxel group (Table 2). Although
the pattern of survival curves (Fig. 3b) and median survival (Table 2) in the nonsquamous cell subgroup was
similar to that in the whole cohort, patients with squamous cell histology who received carboplatin-gemcitabine
had inferior survival (Fig. 3c) compared with those who
received either carboplatin-paclitaxel or carboplatin-docetaxel. In the subgroup of 2063 patients who had squamous cell histology, median survival was 6.7 months
(IQR, 3.7-13.3 months) for 384 patients who received
carboplatin-gemcitabine, 8.4 months (IQR, 3.8-17.8
months) for 1406 patients who received carboplatinpaclitaxel, and 8.3 months (IQR, 3.2-16.1 months)
for 273 patients who received carboplatin-docetaxel
(Table 2).
In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models
adjusting for baseline characteristics, both carboplatingemcitabine (HR, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.05-1.16) and carboplatin-docetaxel (HR, 1.09; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.16) were associated with a slightly higher risk
of death compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel (Table 2).
All propensity score-adjusted models also demonstrated
slight superiority associated with carboplatin-paclitaxel
versus carboplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatin-docetaxel.

Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate the survival of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with advanced non–small cell lung cancer according to first-line chemotherapy regimen for (a) all patients, (b) patients with nonsquamous cell histology, (c) patients
with squamous cell histology, and (d) patients with stage IV disease.

carboplatin-docetaxel, compared with HRs for carboplatin-paclitaxel, were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.15) and 1.09
(95% CI, 1.02-1.16), respectively, in propensity scorestratified models (Table 3). Subgroup analyses of patients
who had stage IV disease did not change our essential
finding of a slight survival advantage associated with
carboplatin-paclitaxel over carboplatin-gemcitabine or
carboplatin-docetaxel (Table 3). In multivariable Cox
models that included treatment-by-histology interaction
terms, a significant interaction effect was identified (HR,
0.87; P ¼ .03) when comparing carboplatin-paclitaxel
with carboplatin-gemcitabine.
The findings from subgroup Cox analyses and propensity score-adjusted analyses of patients with nonsquamous cell histology were similar to findings from the full
cohort. In the squamous cell subgroup, carboplatin-gemcitabine was associated with higher mortality (eg, HR,
1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.35 in the propensity score-stratified
model) compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel. There were
no significant differences in overall survival between
patients with squamous cell histology who received carbo2054

platin-docetaxel and those who received carboplatinpaclitaxel (Table 3).
Compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel, carboplatindocetaxel was associated with higher 30-day or 60-day
post-treatment hospitalization rates in the whole cohort
and in the nonsquamous cell subgroup and with higher
60-day post-treatment hospitalization rates in the squamous cell subgroup (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Our patterns-of-care findings in the NSCLC Medicare
population reveal that carboplatin-based doublets were
the most popular treatment regimens between 2000 and
2007. Carboplatin is received more commonly by elderly
patients instead of cisplatin: it has less nonhematologic
toxicity and is easier to administer in the outpatient
setting, because it does not require vigorous hydration
regimens. In addition, several meta-analyses of clinical trials have suggested that there are no differences or only
marginal differences in overall survival between these 2
regimens.45,46

The modified Charlson comorbidity score was constructed by applying the adaptation reported by Deyo et al.34 of the Charlson comorbidity index35 (modified to exclude cancer diagnoses) to Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims during the 12-month period extending from 13 months to 1 month
before NSCLC diagnosis using lung cancer-specific weights as described by Klabunde et al.36,37
e
Nonsquamous cell carcinoma includes adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and other histologies other than squamous carcinoma.

In terms of effectiveness, we observed that the median survival was 7.3 months for carboplatin-gemcitabine
and 8.0 months for carboplatin-paclitaxel. This small
difference in median survival resembles results from a
722-patient randomized trial, which reported a statistically insignificant 0.8-month difference in median survival between carboplatin-gemcitabine (median survival,
7.9 months) and carboplatin-paclitaxel (median survival,
8.7 months).15 The magnitude of the differences is nearly
identical between the randomized efficacy study and our
observational effectiveness cohort.
Several phase 3 studies were conducted to compare
the efficacy of carboplatin-paclitaxel between different
schedules, but the results were mixed.47,48 For example,
Belani and colleagues observed that weekly paclitaxel with
carboplatin administered every 4 weeks had efficacy similar
to that of the standard regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks.47 However, a more
recent study reported a significantly higher overall response
rate with weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel
plus carboplatin administered every 3 weeks versus the
standard schedule of carboplatin-paclitaxel; in addition,
this advantage was especially remarkable among patients
who had squamous cell histology.48 The impact of different carboplatin-paclitaxel schedules on overall survival in
the Medicare NSCLC population and according to histology was beyond the scope of the current study, but this is a
critical area for future inquiry.
In phase 3 trials, carboplatin-docetaxel achieved a
median survival of 8.2 to 9.5 months,13,49,50 which was
0.7 to 2.0 months longer than what we observed in our
Medicare cohort. This may be because Medicare beneficiaries with NSCLC who received treatment outside of a
2056

clinical trial context were all aged 65 years and did not
have to meet eligibility criteria, such as adequate pulmonary and renal function and good performance status.
The most intriguing finding from the current analysis
was that the association between treatment regimen and
survival varied by histology. We observed that the survival
advantage associated with carboplatin-paclitaxel versus carboplatin-gemcitabine was significantly greater in patients
with squamous cell histology than in those with nonsquamous cell histology. The HR for carboplatin-gemcitabine
versus carboplatin-paclitaxel was higher in the squamous
cell subgroup than in the nonsquamous cell subgroup in all
multivariable and propensity score-adjusted models. These
findings are consistent with a retrospective analysis of a
clinical trial that reported a significant treatment-by-histology interaction effect of carboplatin-gemcitabine versus
carboplatin-paclitaxel.23 In that study, the median survival
of patients with squamous cell histology was 6.6 months
for carboplatin-gemcitabine and 10.3 months for carboplatin-paclitaxel (difference, 3.7 months)23; and, in our study,
it was 6.7 months and 8.4 months, respectively (difference,
1.7 months). In contrast, the difference in median survival
for patients with nonsquamous cell histology between
carboplatin-gemcitabine and carboplatin-paclitaxel was
0.5 months (7.5 months for carboplatin-gemcitabine and
8.0 months for carboplatin-paclitaxel) in our study and
0.1 months (8.2 months for carboplatin-gemcitabine and
8.3 months for carboplatin-paclitaxel) in the earlier trial.23
Our findings, however, are not consistent with an
earlier evaluation of SEER-Medicare data among patients
who had NSCLC diagnosed between 1997 and 2002 that
did not identify a significant treatment-by-histology interaction.51 The insignificant finding may be attributed to the

small sample size (eg, only 84 patients with squamous cell
histology received carboplatin-gemcitabine or cisplatingemcitabine) and the combination of carboplatin-gemcitabine and cisplatin-gemcitabine into a single group. Nevertheless, a combined analysis of the patient-level data from
3 phase 3 randomized controlled trials identified a survival
advantage of 0.8 months for cisplatin-gemcitabine in treating patients with squamous cell histology (10.8 months)
relative to those with nonsquamous cell histology (10.0
months).52 In contrast, the same study demonstrated a
1.7-month survival inferiority with carboplatin-gemcitabine
in treating patients with squamous cell histology (6.6
months) versus those with nonsquamous cell histology (8.3
months).52 The reason why carboplatin-gemcitabine was
associated with inferior treatment outcomes for patients
with squamous cell histology is not clear. Molecular subCancer

typing of NSCLC53 in addition to SEER registry data may
enable the future evaluation of effectiveness based on
molecularly defined subtypes but is not yet possible.
Our study has several limitations. First, the study was
limited to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were
aged 65 years and living in a SEER region at diagnosis.
Although this cohort may not be representative of all
patients with NSCLC in the United States,26 it is likely to
inform the clinical treatment of patients who are older and
more infirm than clinical trial participants, because it draws
from a wider group of patients. Second, SEER-Medicare
data lack essential clinical details, such as the presence of
molecular biomarkers and performance status, which may

population. Because patients with lung cancer have median
age of 70 years at diagnosis,54 the impact on this population is germane. Most important, although we used statistical techniques to mitigate the bias caused by measured
confounders, the potential for bias caused by unmeasured
factors that predisposed patients to be selected for a particular treatment group cannot be excluded. The lack of
randomization prevents us from making direct causal inferences about effectiveness.
In conclusion, our analyses suggest that carboplatinpaclitaxel is associated with a slight survival advantage
over carboplatin-gemcitabine or carboplatin-docetaxel
within the Medicare population with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Because the survival difference is marginal, our effectiveness analysis substantiates clinical trial
data suggesting that the choice of regimen may be tailored
to patient characteristics, patient preference, and other
factors, such as toxicity profiles, convenience, and cost.
Carboplatin with paclitaxel or docetaxel may be preferred
over carboplatin-gemcitabine for elderly patients who
have NSCLC with squamous cell histology.
