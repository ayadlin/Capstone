Beneﬁts of Vascular Normalization Are Dose and Time Dependent—Letter
Yuhui Huang, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Dan G. Duda, Dai Fukumura, and Rakesh K. Jain

Arjaans and colleagues reported that treatment with the
anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab hampers antibody uptake
in an ectopic xenograft model of human ovarian cancer in
mice (1). They found that bevacizumab decreased vessel
number and increased pericyte coverage and concluded
that treatment-induced normalization is detrimental for
antibody delivery. This conclusion is not supported by
their data and is in disagreement with the existing literature
(2–4).
Vascular normalization after antiangiogenic therapy could
explain the seemingly paradoxical synergism between antiangiogenic agents and concurrent systemic anticancer therapies (2). The vascular normalization paradigm was originally
described to have four key elements: structural normalization, functional normalization, the transient nature of
the effects, and the dose dependence (Fig. 1), with functional
normalization being the most important element (2).
Arjaans and colleagues used a relatively high dose of
bevacizumab and detected structural changes consistent
with structural vascular normalization. However, they present no evidence that bevacizumab functionally normalized
tumor blood vessels, nor do they mention when antibody
treatment was delivered with respect to the vascular
normalization time window. These deﬁciencies notwithstanding, the study raises an important question: Could
antiangiogenic therapy impair the delivery of antibodies?
The answer is likely yes, as the normalization time window
may narrow or even disappear when antiangiogenic agents
are dosed to potentiate antivascular effects. Antivascular
effects could lead to a transient delay in tumor growth. The
remaining vessels may be pericyte-covered, but because
these treatments greatly reduce the number of functional
vessels, they could potentially hinder the delivery of drugs at
that time—a status referred to as "inadequate" rather than
"normalized" vasculature (2, 5). This scenario is more consistent with the report by Arjaans and colleagues (1), that is,
a predominant antivascular rather than vascular normalizing effect of bevacizumab in their experimental setting. The
potential of antiangiogenics to produce both vascular normalizing and antivascular effects is of great clinical relevance for how these drugs should be combined with other
therapeutics. Indeed, clinical studies have shown that the

addition of high-dose bevacizumab does not improve overall
survival when combined with chemotherapeutics in some
cancers, such as ovarian or breast cancers. Therefore, it
is high time we design better ways for using antiangiogenic
therapy in the clinic. Our recent work suggests that
anti-VEGFR2 antibody (DC101) treatment can normalize
orthotopic tumor vasculature and enhance the delivery of
anticancer agents in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2; refs. 3, 4). It also shows that these beneﬁts may be lost
when using high-dose antiangiogenic therapy due to pronounced antivascular effects. Thus, optimizing combinations of antiangiogenic agents with anticancer treatments
will require imaging and/or circulating biomarkers based on
an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of the tumor
vascular response, in particular the balance between vascular normalizing and antivascular effects.

Normalization window is
dose and time dependent

Figure 1. Vascular normalization hypothesis. Because of imbalance
between pro- and antiangiogenic signaling, tumor vessels are highly
abnormal both structurally and functionally. This creates a hostile
microenvironment in tumors—characterized by hypoxia, low pH, and
elevated ﬂuid pressure—which fuels tumor progression via genetic
instability, angiogenesis, endothelial–mesenchymal transition,
immunosuppression, inﬂammation, resistance to apoptosis/autophagy,
etc. Anti-VEGF treatment, using a judicious dose of bevacizumab (or
another antiangiogenic agent), can prune some abnormal vessels and
remodel the rest, resulting in a "normalized vasculature." In turn, this
can reduce tumor hypoxia, acidity, and ﬂuid pressure, improving the
outcome of chemo-, radio-, and immunotherapy. If the antiangiogenic
agent is too potent or the dose is too high, the balance can tip in the other
direction, resulting in the pruning of an excessive number of vessels,
leading to a shorter window of normalization or "inadequate vasculature"
and reduced delivery of oxygen and concurrently administered
therapeutics. Higher doses can also lead to adverse effects in normal
tissues. Reproduced from the work of Jain (2). Reprinted with permission.

Figure 2. Dose and time dependence of vascular normalization in solid tumors. A and B, dose-dependent effects of antiangiogenic treatment on vascular
morphology and function in orthotopic breast tumors. When MCaP0008 tumors reached 4 to 5 mm in diameter, mice were treated with DC101 (10, 20,
or 40 mg/kg body weight) or rat IgG as control (40 mg/kg body weight), 4 doses, every 3 days starting on day 0. Mice were injected with 200 mg Hoechst
33342 i.v. before tumor harvest on day 11. Whole-tumor tissue perfusion images were taken by multispectral confocal microscopy. A, representative

Measurements in orthotopic E0771 mammary tumors over an 8-day course of treatment with either 5 mg/kg DC101 or nonspeciﬁc rat IgG every 3 days
starting on day 0. C, treatment with DC101 reduced vascular diameter on days 2 and 5, with no difference on day 8. D, treatment with DC101 enhanced
effective vascular permeability (transvascular ﬂux) on days 2 (P ¼ 0.049; Student t test) and 5 (P ¼ 0.017; Student t test), with no difference in the
treatment groups by day 8. Animal number n ¼ 4–5 for all groups. E, size-dependent effects of vascular normalization on nanoparticle delivery in
tumors. Effective permeability for nanoparticles in orthotopic E0771 mammary tumors in mice treated with 5 mg/kg DC101. Normalization improved the
permeability of 12-nm particles (which is in the size range of an antibody) on day 2 by a factor of 2.7 in E0771 (P ¼ 0.049; Student t test) while not improving
delivery for larger nanoparticles (60 and 125 nm). Animal number n ¼ 5 for all groups. C–E were adapted from Chauhan and colleagues (4).
