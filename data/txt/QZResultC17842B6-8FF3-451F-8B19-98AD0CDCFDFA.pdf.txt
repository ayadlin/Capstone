Abstract
As a conserved protein interaction module that recognizes and binds to acetylated
lysine, bromodomain (BRD) contains a deep, largely hydrophobic acetyl lysine binding
site. Proteins that share the feature of containing two BRDs and an extra-terminal
domain belong to BET family, including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT. BET family
proteins perform transcription regulatory function under normal conditions, while in
cancer, they regulate transcription of several oncogenes, such as c-Myc and Bcl-2.
Thus, targeting BET proteins may be a promising strategy, and intense interest of BET
proteins has fueled the development of structure-based bromodomain inhibitors in
cancer. In this review, we focus on summarizing several small-molecule BET inhibitors
and their relevant anti-tumor mechanisms, which would provide a clue for exploiting
new targeted BET inhibitors in the future cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

binding domains, belong to a family of evolutionarily
conserved protein modules originally found in proteins
associated with chromatin and in nearly all nuclear HATs
[10]. BRDs may contribute to highly specific histone
acetylation by tethering transcriptional HATs to specific
chromosomal sites, or to the activity of multi-protein
complexes in chromatin remodeling [11]. Thus, BRDs
modulate enzyme activities, protein assembly and proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) via lysine acetylation, revealing
broad implications for the mechanisms underlying a wide
variety of cellular events, such as transcriptional activation
and chromatin remodeling [12].
Human genome encodes 61 BRDs in 46 different
proteins, in which legend specificity is imparted in
the amino acid residue differences around the acetyllysine binding site [13]. BRD proteins mostly contain
one or two bromodomains, while some proteins, such
as nuclear scaffolding proteins (PB1), contain more
than two BRDs [14]. Bromodomain and extra-terminal

Acetylation of lysine residues is a widespread
protein post-translational modification (PTM), and
extensively relevant to modulation of cellular processes,
including protein conformation and interaction [1].
Histone lysine acetylation was historically proposed to
be a hallmark of transcriptionally active genes [2], and
hitherto, deregulation of histone acetylation patterns
often drives the aberrant expression of oncogenes
resulting in proliferation and tumorigenesis [3]. Three
types of proteins have been identified to regulate lysine
acetylation: bromodomain (BRD) proteins [4, 5],
histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and sirtuins (SIRTs) [6-9]. BRD proteins bind
to acetylated lysine (Kac) and thus acting as readers of
lysine acetylation state; HATs effect lysine acetylation
acting as writers; HDACs and SIRTs remove acetyl groups
as erasers [9]. Bromodomains, functioning as acetyl-lysine

(BET), which taxonomically belongs to human BRD
proteins family, shares a common domain architecture
comprising two N-terminal bromodomains and an extra-C
terminal domain. BET family consists of four mammalian
members, including BRD containing 2 (BRD2), BRD3,
BRD4 and BRDT, which both exhibit high levels of
sequence conservation and a more divergent C-terminal
recruitment [14]. Additionally, BET family proteins have
been identified in oncogenic rearrangements, leading to
highly oncogenic fusion proteins, and thus play key roles
in development of several types of cancer. However, it is
still unclear why only a subset of cells from diverse types
of cancer responds to BET inhibitors [15].
Currently, there have been five registered active
clinical trials investigating the targeting of BET family
proteins, such as RVX-208, I-BET 762, OTX 015, CPI0610 and TEN-010, in which OTX 015 has reported
encouraging results in treating hematologic malignancies
[16-19]. Meanwhile, multiple small-molecule inhibitors
of BETs have also been developed and revealed great
potential for clinical application, for instance, JQ1 and
I-BET both exert the ability to interact with NF-κB and
induce apoptosis in drug-resistant leukemia [20]. Hitherto,
a number of landmark reports have revealed that the
“reader” bromodomains are promising therapeutic targets
in cancer. In this review, we summarize a series of smallmolecule BET inhibitors and their molecular mechanisms
in cancer, which may shed light on exploiting more novel
BET inhibitors for future drug discovery.

sequence Φ1X1X2(X3)Φ2X3X4X5(X6)Φ3, as Φi representing
hydrophobic residues, N-terminal domain of BET family
members specifically presents insertions at X3 [22]. At
one end, the N and C termini come together, emphasizing
the modular architecture of this domain and underscoring
the idea that the BRD could act as a functional unit for
PPIs. At the opposite end, the ZA loop packs against the
BC loop, forming a central deep hydrophobic cavity that
recognized as acetyl-lysine epitopes [24]. High-resolution
co‑crystal structures have shown that the first acetylated
lysine mark of histone H4 docks directly onto the
conserved asparagine. Conserved residue phenylalanine of
BRDs deeply buried in helix αC stabilizes the C-terminus
helical segment, while three conserved proline residues
that ZA loop harbors may closely pack to hydrophobic
residues in a C stabilizing the loop conformation.
Simultaneously, similar as most BRD proteins, X-ray
crystallography verifies BD1 of BRD2, 3 and 4 have an
isoleucine at the position analogous to residue 162 in
BRD2. This ‘gatekeeper’ residue, which varies in size
across the BRD family, controls access to a lipophilic
region comprising a tryptophan-proline-phenylalanine
sequence (WPF shelf) which is present in a number of
BRDs [25]. In BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, affinity between
H4 tail and different BRDs varied, for instance, BRD4 (1)
seemed to specifically recognize multiple marks found on
the H4 tail, while BRD4 (2) interacts with combinations
of two and three acetylated lysines. However, studies
indicate that BRDT requires two Kac residues for high–
affinity binding. The importance of this shelf was also
highlighted in BRDT, in which a diacetylated histone
H4 tail to BRDT-BD1 and second AcK at position 8 lies
across the WPF shelf leading to increased binding affinity
[25]. BRDs distinguish different protein binding partners
since they hold the sequence diversity in ZA and BC loop
regions, binding to residues neighboring Kac in the target
protein or peptide [26] (Figure 1).

STRUCTURE CHARACTERISTICS OF BET
PROTEINS
BET family proteins all localize in the nucleus,
and contain two tandems N-terminal BRDs, an extraterminal (ET) domain and a more divergent C-terminal
recruitment domain, all of which exhibit high levels of
sequence conservation. Spanning 61 human BRDs,
eight major BRD families are clustered by the derived
phylogram analysis, in which BET family belongs to the
sub-family II [21]. BRDs’ structural analysis of histones
lysine-acetylated peptides recognition provides deep
insights into characteristics and differences of biological
ligand binding selectivity. Not only in BET family, but in
all BRDs, it is likely that a hydrogen bond anchor Kac
by a conserved asparagine residue their primary role is
binding to Kac residues [22]. Besides, the conserved BRD
fold contains a deep and largely hydrophobic acetyl lysine
binding site, comprised of approximately 110 amino acids.
BRDs contain 4 helices αZ, αA, αB, and αC, which form
a characteristic antiparallel four-helix bundle, linked by
two diverse loop regions, ZA and BC loops [23]. Helix
αZ is flanked by a diverse sequence region, whose
inserts are typically followed by a short helical segment
in the ZA loop. The conserved motif follows the generic

BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF BET FAMILY
BET proteins are protein scaffolds, mitotic bookmarks
and cell cycle regulators
Except BRDT specially locating in testis, BET
proteins are widely distributed, and exert function to
regulate an array of cellular processes. Firstly detected
as protein scaffolds, BET family proteins recruit variety
proteins to chromatin and transcription sites. During
interphase, BRD4 recruits positive transcriptional
elongation factor complex (PTEFb) to sites of active
transcription, while another pool of BRD4 may be
recruited by transcription mediator complexes independent
of PTEFb [27]. In addition, the ET domain of BRD4
independently recruits transcription-modifying factors,
including glioma tumor suppressor candidate region
gene 1 (GLTSCR1); NSD3, a SET domain-containing

of immature unspliced transcripts to high levels of
active mature mRNA. BRD4 is part of the transcription
pre-initiation complex and remains associated with
the RNAP II transcription complex until productive
elongation, and it directly phosphorylates Ser2 while
PTEFb only phosphorylates Ser2 if Ser5 has not been
previously phosphorylated [25, 31]. Conversely, BRD4 is
phosphorylated and activated by PTEFb. In addition, the
same as TFIIH and PTEFb, BRD4 can directly interact
with TAF7, a general transcription factor that regulates
all three CTD kinases [36] (Figure 2C). BRD2 regulates
transcription through E2F-RB pathway, while HDAC
can phosphorylate RB to arrest the transcription process
[37]. The involvement of BRD3 in cancer showed its
role in the certain NMC translocations, and BRD3 can
potentially associated with MLL fusion oncoproteins
in leukemogenesis [38].Transcriptional inhibition is
correlated with the prevention of signal-induced BRD-2,
-3 and -4 protein recruitment to affected gene promoters.
The inhibitor of BET selectively attenuated the induction
of secondary response genes characterized by low CpG
content, low basal H3 and H4 acetylation levels, low
H3K4me3 methylation and low RNA polymerase II
occupancy, suggesting BET proteins are involved in the
recognition of gene promoters containing a combination
of post-translational histone marks characteristic of
poised but inactive secondary response genes [39].
BRD4 regulates NF-κB -dependent genes by binding
acetylated RelA subunit of NF-kB [40]. The only specially
expressed protein, BRDT, named as bromodomain testisspecific protein, has been reported in several stages of
spermatogenesis. BRDT directly regulates activation of
transcriptional repressors and activators in spermatocytes,
and interacts with hyper-acetylated histone H4 tails to
induce condensation of acetylated chromatin of haploid
spermatids. In addition, it possesses similar functions
of BRD4 in the recruitment of PTEFb to form PTEFb
complex [38,100]. Rapid development of both biological
function and structural basis of BET protein has made it a
newly emerging agent for therapeutic strategy of cancer.
Development of small-molecule compounds targeting
BET bromodomains has won increasingly attentions by
biomedical researchers into this field.

histone methyltransferase; JMJD6, a histone arginine
demethylase; and CHD4, a catalytic component of the
NuRD nucleosome remodeling complex [28]. (Figure
2A) Different from BRD4, BRD2 binds to ε-aminoacetyl
groups of nucleosomal histone lysines in a PTEFbindependent manner, and with related bromodomain
proteins it provides a scaffold on chromatin to recruit E2F
proteins , histone deacetylases (HDACs) , histone H4specific acetyltransferase (HAT) and proteins involved
in chromatin remodeling, thereby coupling histone
acetylation to transcription [29] (Figure 2B). Similar
with BRD2, BRD3 may regulate cell processes through
E2F-RB pathway, moreover, it can directly recognized
acetylated transcription factor, GATA1, which is essential
for the targeting of GATA1 to chromatin [30](Figure 2C).
BET family may also function as mitotic bookmark,
identifying actively transcribed genes during mitosis by
remaining associated chromatin when all the other factors
dissociate. BRD4 remains associated with H4K5ac
histones on chromatin during mitosis, leading to rapid
de-compaction of the surrounding chromatin and to
transcription post-mitotically [31]. BRD4 marks the start
sites of many M/G1 genes, and accelerates expression
of G1 genes and promotes cell cycle progression to S
phase [32] BRD4 seems to be required for the G2 to M
phase transition of the cell cycle because microinjection
of BRD4-specific antibodies leads to cell cycle arrest
[33] Then, BET family proteins function as cell cycle
regulators, as mentioned before, that key transcriptional
regulators genes of S phase, E2F1 and E2F2, are associated
with BRD2 multi-protein complexes [33]. BRD3dependent functional relationships with the cell cycle
control machinery in normal cells are poorly understood,
although forced expression of BRD3 down-regulates the
RB–E2F pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells [33].
BET proteins function as transcription regulators
BET family has a pivotal role in regulating the
transcription of growth-promoting genes [34], for instance,
BRD4 and BRD2 are key mediators of transcriptional
elongation by recruiting the PTEFb, which is composed
of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and its activator
cyclin T. Productive transcription depends on the
phosphorylation of the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD)
of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and phosphorylation of
the CTD residues Serine 5 (Ser5) and Serine 2 (Ser2) is
necessary for the recruitment of RNA capping and splicing
factors [35]. CTD Ser5 residues are phosphorylated
primarily by the CDK7 kinase component of TFIIH,
while subsequent Ser2 phosphorylation release RNAP II
from an early elongation block and are necessary during
productive elongation [36]. During elongation, Ser2 is
phosphorylated by PTEFb, which depends on BRD4 for
its nuclear localization and activation of its CDK9 kinase
subunit [36]. BRD4 acts by affecting an acetylation
and PTEFb dependent switch from basal transcription

BET proteins function in cancer
Histone acetylation levels have been associated
with an open chromatin architecture and transcriptional
activation, but specific marks have been linked to
chromatin condensation [41], regulation of metabolism
[42] and DNA repair [43]. Therefore, inappropriate
acetylation levels have been associated with an aberrant
transcription of disease-promoting genes, including
cancer-related genes [44]. BET family proteins have been
reported to be involved in a variety of malignant tumors,
between which NUT-NMC have been reported to closely
related to BRD proteins, in which the BRD-NUT blocks

cellular differentiation, and depletion of this oncogene
in squamous differentiation and cell cycle arrest. NUT
midline carcinoma (NMC), an aggressive squamous cell
carcinoma, is accordance with acquired chromosomal
rearrangements involving NUT, creating chimeric genes
that encode fusion proteins. Usually BRD4-NUT fusion
genes are been detected, and less commonly NUT-variant
fusion genes involving BRD3 also exists, leading to the
expression of BRD-NUT fusion proteins [45].
BET family proteins have reported to able to
promote aberrant gene expression in leukemia. MYCfamily transcription factors are key regulators of cell
growth and survival, whose gene amplification is a
common copy-number alteration in cancer, while overexpression or translocation of the MYC locus contributes
to Myc activity deregulation. In hematologic cancer
models, such as MLL-fusion leukemia [46], acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) [47], Burkitt’s lymphoma [48], multiple
myeloma [49], and B-cell acute lymphoblastic (BLL)
leukemia [50], amplification of onco-protein Myc drives
distinct transcription programs, and leads to a consequence
of cell proliferation. BET family directly regulate the
expression of MYC genes, and directly silencing MYC
gene expression via disruption of BET protein binding at
the MYC locus may largely reduce cell proliferation [51].
Amplification or over-expression of MYC is frequently
observed in lung cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer
[52]. By recruiting a histone H3K36 methytransferase,
WHSC1, BET protein BRD3/4 plays a key role in
tamoxifen resistance to the ESR1 gene. WHSC1 is critical
for maintaining estrogen signaling in ER-positive cells via
forming a positive feedback regulatory loop with ERα,
which is overexpressed in breast cancer. BRD3/4 interacts
with WHSC1 in BRD regions, recognizes acetylated
lysines on histone tails of the ESR1 promoter and recruits
WHSC1, promoting ESR1 transcription [53]. Recent
studies have unraveled a possible mechanism about how
BRD4 proteins are involved in the transcription of active
genes in cancers, especially associated with a subset of
these genes. As previous mentioned, BRD4 and Mediator
form a complex in transcription process, this complex may
related to super-enhancers, which are span large genomic
regions and contain exceptional amounts of Mediator
and BRD4. In addition, important tumor genes are also
associated with super-enhancers, so far has been identified
in myeloma, small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma.
Therefore, BRD4 may regulate ongenetic drivers, such
as MYC, through occupying super-enhancers, while
inhibition of BRD4 also leads to preferential disruption of
super-enhancers and selective loss of oncogene expression
[70].
Cancers of neural origin may be related to the distinct
expression of BET proteins including glioblastoma,
medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma. For instance,
neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor associated with
a high frequency of MYCN amplifications, and inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of BET proteins in neuroblastoma leads to cell arrest
[54]. BET proteins are also required for glioblastoma cell
proliferation, mRNA of BRD2 and BRD4 are significantly
overexpressed in glioblastoma, while disruption of BRD4
expression reduced glioblastoma cell cycle progression
[55]. In melanoma, tumor progression may contribute to
epigenetic changes, thus epigenetic and/or transcriptional
regulation of certain target genes may support melanoma
tumor-genesis. NF-κB regulates cytokine and chemokine
production in melanoma, and is believed to contribute
to progression of the disease by up-regulation of cell
cycle and anti-apoptotic genes [56]. BRD2 and BRD4
are overexpressed in human primary and metastatic
melanomas, whose inhibition resulted in down-regulating
production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 [57].
The largely hydrophobic nature of the central
acetylated lysine binding pocket and special extra-terminal
domain of BET are necessary to accommodate the chargeneutralized acetylated lysine and recruits related proteins,
making these modules particularly attractive for the
development of inhibitors. Many proteins that use BRDs
for their recruitment to specific regulatory complexes
have been implicated in the development of cancer
[58, 45]. The key principle that identification of smallmolecule inhibitors with micromolar affinities has been
identified, and recently two selective nanomolar inhibitors
of BET proteins, JQ1 and I-BET, have been reported
[59, 60]. Increased studies have focus on exploring new
small-molecule compounds to selectively inhibit BET
bromodomains for cancer therapy, and to date, several
compounds have been found to exert their remarkable
anti-cancer capacities (Table 1).

SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF BET
BROMODOMAINS IN CANCER
BRD2/4 Inhibitors
The close similarity, about 80% at the amino acid
level in human, between the bromodomains of BRD2
and BRD4 implies that two proteins may share a highly
substantial functional similarity. Identified functional
studies have verified that both BRD2 and BRD4 play
crucial roles in transcription regulation, chromatin
remodeling and recruiting related-protein, although the
specific proteins may vary. (Figure 3)
Due to the special structure interface of BRD4
protein, targeting bromodomain of BRD4 to inhibit the
activity of BRD4-NUT fused protein become an attractive
therapeutic strategy. With extensive researches, a small
molecular compound, JQ1, exerts both strong inhibition
efficiency and highly absorption rate towards NMC. JQ1 is
a novel thieno-triazolo-1, 4-diazepine, whose competitive
binding to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs enables it a
successful anti-proliferative agent in BRD4 dependent
cell lines. The bulky t-butyl ester functional group at

C6 also allows it additional pendant group diversity
and less binding to the central benazodiaepine receptor
[59]. Additionally, results of screen of diverse inhibitors
of BRD4-NUT and laboratory experiments confirmed
JQ1 may process a better efficiency, comparing to the
counterpart of other clinic drugs, suggesting its potential
in future preclinical studies [61].
Since the crucial role BET proteins plays in
leukemia, JQ1 also possesses significant anti-proliferative
effect in leukemia, such as AML, T-cell ALL. In addition,
JQ1 can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of human
AML cells, including those expressing FLT3-ITD(FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3- internal tandem duplication),a
mutation of proto-oncogene. Recent studies also shows
that co-treatment of JQ1 and FLT3-inhibitor, FLT3-TKI,
can greatly attenuate the expression of c-MYC, BCL2,
and CDK4/6, meanwhile synergistically induce apoptosis
of cultured and primary CD34(+) human AML blast
progenitor cells (BPC) expressing [62]. Activation of
caspase 3/7, but not caspase 8, is found in JQ1-mediated
apoptosis, indicating that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
is involved [63].
In other hematologic malignancies, JQ1 may exert
anti-tumor ability through targeting BRD2, as BRD2
is the critical mediator for STAT5 activity. STAT5, a
transcription factor signal, is constitutively activated and
drives the expression of genes necessary for proliferation,
survival, and self-renewal in leukemia. In experimental
models of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, JQ1
decreases STAT5-dependent (but not STAT3-dependent)
transcription of both heterologous reporter genes and
endogenous STAT5 target genes, and shows strong
synergy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in inducing
apoptosis in leukemia cells [64].
BET family proteins may participate in the
malignant brain tumor gene regulation, for instance, highlevel BRD4 expression was detected in 99 of 115 pediatric
primary medulloblastomas (75%) while it was only
marginally (22%) expressed in normal cerebellar tissue.
One significant clinical challenge for medulloblastoma
in pediatric oncology stands that the overall survival
currently remains under 70%, and patients with tumors
overexpressing MYC or harboring MYC oncogene
amplification have an extremely poor prognosis [65].
JQ1 treatment can significantly reduce cell proliferation
and induce apoptosis and senescence in different human
medulloblastoma cells. Those MYC-amplified cell lines,
HD-MB3, ONS-76 and D-341, produced the strongest
apoptotic response, while the expression of MYCassociated proteins, such as Cyclin D1 and E2F1, were
reduced as well, suggesting JQ1 may exert its anti-tumor
ability by targeting BRD4-Myc pathway [66]. Similarly
in human neuroblastoma, JQ1 targeted BRD4 to regulate
MYCN expression, and induced cell death [67]. In
addition, JQ1 inhibited expression of BRD3 and BRD4,
and suppressed the classic estrogen receptor-α signaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathway, resulting in the growth suppression of Tamoxifen
resistant breast cancer cells in culture [53].
Particularly in virus-induced tumors, inhibition of
host-encoded BET regulates both transcriptional activation
and transcriptional repression of virus promoters, making
JQ1 a promising therapeutic agent as well. In etiology
study of human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1)mediated adult T cell leukemia, JQ1 suppressed the
proliferation of Tax-expressing rat fibroblasts, and
inhibited transformation and tumor-genesis of Tax-positive
HTLV-1-infected cells and Tax-mediated cell. Considering
Tax can induce the acetylation of lysine 310 of RelA and
promote BRD4 binding acetylated RelA, inhibition of
BRD4 by JQ1 may suppress Tax-mediated transcriptional
activation of NF-κB [68]. JQ1 treatment can reduce
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) promoter in lymphomas. EBV
is the causative agent of lympho-proliferative diseases,
whose nuclear antigen (EBNA) proteins providing a
functional analogue of LANA1 (Latency-associated
nuclear antigen). During the transcription elongation
of EBV, inhibition of host-encoded BRD4 can suppress
recruiting of PTEFb to viral C promoter, therefore
negatively controlling the replication of EBV [69]. JQ1
treatment reduces BRD4 association with the promoter,
providing a promising future of drug development in
the treatment of latent virus infections by disrupting
transcriptional co-regulator.
BET inhibitor, OTX 015, shows the clinically
meaningful activity at nontoxic doses, in which inter
results of an ongoing phase I trial in hematologic
malignances are inspiring. Besides regulating the
BRD4, OTX 015 can inhibit the growth of hematologic
malignances through directly regulating MYC expression
and activity [16]. Besides that, currently, OTX015 has
been reported to exert anti-proliferative activity in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). OTX 015 is highly
sensitive to majority (9 of 13) of DLBCL cell lines, and
suppression of MYC caused by OTX015 is reversible in
DLBCL [71].
GSK525762A (I-BET762) is a specific and
potent inhibitor of BET protein binding to acetylated
bromodomains, and GSK has embarked it on Phase
I clinical trial of NMC. It is derived from medicinal
chemistry optimization of a hit derived from a phenotypic
screen to identify small molecules able to enhance
ApoA1 expression [72] The fusion between BRD4 (and
to a lesser extent BRD3) with NUT gene leads to NMC
[73], and this fusion is oncogenic due to the inability to
sequester important regulatory molecules such as CBP/
p300 into BRD4-NUT nuclear foci, which are formed in
a bromodomain-dependent manner, and knockdown of
BRD4-NUT with anti-NUT siRNAs has been shown to
lead to cell differentiation and apoptosis [74]. Treatment
of patient-derived samples with I-BET762 has been shown
to lead to terminal differentiation and growth arrest of
the malignant cells [74]. In addition, I-BET762 potently

reduced MYC expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cell
lines and a patient-derived tumor model with subsequent
inhibition of cell growth and reduction of tumor burden
in vivo [75]. In neuroblastoma tumor models, I-BET 762
can trigger apoptosis through BET inhibition of N-Mycdriven pathways, including the direct suppression of Bcl-2
and MYCN. And conversely, reversal of MYCN or BCL2
suppression reduces the potency of I-BET726-induced
cytotoxicity in a cell line-specific manner [76]. Further,
I-BET762 can influence myeloma cell proliferation,
resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma
xenograft model [77].
Similar with JQ1, non-benzodiazepine I-BET151
is a pan-BET inhibitor, which can exhibit significant
anti-tumor activity in murine models of NUT midline
carcinoma, multiple myeloma, MLL and ALL, lung
cancer, and malignant brain tumor. In cellular studies of
myelo-proliferative neoplasms driven by mutant JAK2
(JAK2V617F), I-BET151 possessed growth inhibitory
activity with concomitant down-regulation of LMO2,
an important oncogenic regulator of hematopoietic stem
cell development [78]. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
with mutations of the nucleophosmin gene (NPM1),
I-BET 151 treatment may down-regulate the core
transcriptional program, which is HOX gene independent
underlies sensitivity to I-BET treatment [79]. Similar
with I-BET762, I-BET151 also inhibits myeloma cell
proliferation through inducing apoptosis and exerting
strong anti-proliferative effect in vitro and in vivo through
transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent
programs by abrogating recruitment to transcriptional
activator PTEFb [77]. BRD2 is the main BET protein
involved in regulation of NF-kB and that I-BET151
caused transcriptional downregulation of the NF-kB
subunit p105/p50 [80].
CPI203, a BET bromodomain inhibitor, can
affect the lymphoma cell growth. The development of

activity. An increased tumorigenicity of bortezomibresistant MCL cells, which is associated with plasmacytic

differentiation features, like interferon regulatory factor
4 (IRF4) and Blimp-1 up-regulation. Repression of the
IRF4 target gene MYC in bortezomib-resistant cells by
gene knockdown or treatment with CPI203 synergistically
induced cell death when combined with lenalidomide
[81]. In mice, addition of CPI203 to lenalidomide therapy
further decreased tumor burden, involving simultaneous
MYC and IRF4 down-regulation and apoptosis induction
[81]. RVX2135, a novel and orally bioavailable selective
pan-BET inhibitor, presented anti-proliferative ability in
Myc-induced lymphoma. What’s more, RVX2135 was
reported that broad transcriptional changes are mediated,
while these are genetically and functionally linked to
histone deacetylase inhibitors [82].
PFI-1, a novel dihydroquinazolinone reported
as a BET chemical probe, binds to BET bromodomain
chemically distinct from previously reported BET
inhibitors. Exposure of leukemia cells to PFI-1 results in
induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis, differentiation
and in down-regulation of the Aurora B kinase. Aurora
kinases are highly expressed in diverse cancer types and
are also frequently up-regulated in leukemia [83]. In
the BET inhibitor sensitive cell line MV4, researchers
observed strong induction of PARP1 and pro-caspase
7 cleavage after 24 h exposure with PFI-1 [84]. PFI-1
and JQ1 dissociate BRD4 from HOXA9 and promotes
differentiation, as a marker of poor prognosis in patients
with acute myeloid leukemia [85] and overexpression of
HOXA9 leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in
bone marrow cells and development of leukemia in mice
[84, 85].
Further, more efficient dual kinase-bromodomain
inhibitors have been developed for rationally designed
polypharmacology. For instance, two nanomolar activities
on BRD4 inhibitors, BI-2536 and TG-101348, have been
identified to inhibit bromodomains with therapeutically
relevant potencies, particularly noteworthy as shedding
light on independent oncogenic pathways [99].

BRD3 Inhibitors

BD1 [91], suggesting the selective inhibition of RVX208 may cause drugs nullity. Considering the important
role ApoA1 played in hepatocellular carcinoma, and
chemical inhibition of BDs has been associated with
ApoA1 up-regulation, RVX-208 can be used as drugs of
hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, other potent BET
inhibitor, JQ1 has strongly stimulated ApoA-I production
in Hep-G2 cells in a post-translational regulation manner
[92], making it appealing of developing multi-target
inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma (Figure 4A).

Diverse from BRD2-dependent roles in
regulating differentiation of adipose tissue and neurons,
BRD3 mainly functions in recruitment of GATA1 in
hematopoietic cells through regulating maturation of
erythroid, megakaryocyte, and mast cell lineages [86, 87].
Inhibitors of BRD3 are less studied than their counterparts
in BRD2 and BRD4, due to the lacking of specific
mechanism of BRD3. However, pan-BET inhibitors, like
JQ1 and I-BET-151, have been found to target BRD3 in
NMC and leukemia [88], and inhibition with an I-BET762
analogue led to disruption of normal erythroid maturation.
Currently, a disappointing result of negative clinical
finding of RVX-208 has been reported, which is acting as
an ApoA1 modulator in phase I/II clinical trials for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases [89] The quinazolone
RVX-208, a derivative of the plant polyphenol resveratrol,
acts as interaction partner of ApoA1 and performs a
preferentially binding ability to the BD2 of BRD3,
exhibiting selectivity over BD1 of up to 23-fold [90].
However, previous studies of BRD3 that showed that its
recruitment to acetylated sites on GATA1 is mediated by

BRDT Inhibitors
BRDT, as a tesis-specific BET family member, have
been observed the selective function of its two BDs, in
which deletion of BD1 in BRDT may result in abnormal
spermatids and sterility [93]. Furthermore, altered
histone modifications in mice have been observed in the
BRDT promoter region of sub-fertile patients. A potent
inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Dinaciclib
can interact with BRDT and bind in the ZA channel of
BRD [94], and reporting the potential of Dinaciclib to
act as protein-protein inhibitors of bromodomains, and
considering Dinaciclib has advanced to Phase III clinical

BRD3-NUT fusion proteins in NMC, which is similar with BRD4. Specifically inhibiting BRD3-NUT fusion protein can block BRD3NUT gene transcription, and inhibit NMC cell growth. (B) Pan-inhibitors I-BET762 and JQ1 inhibits BRD3. (C) As the only member

isoforms haven’t been fully studied. Therefore, further
development of domain and isoform specific inhibitors
need to be necessary for unravelling the exact roles of BET
bromodomains in gene transcription. And, the alternative
expression levels of BET proteins in various cancers still
need to be further discovered. However, BET proteins
mediated PPI network have not been fully unraveled;
therefore, development of mechanism towards PPI of BET
may be a promising studying flied, which may also benefit
the drug development to BET inhibitors.
In conclusion, rapid success has been achieved with
the BET family of bromodomains, and numbers of potent
small-molecule inhibitors have been reported. Inspiring
findings that various inhibitors bear their own anti-tumor
abilities have been enlightening us for further designing
and discovering more new potential BET inhibitors.
Moreover, clinical studies and mechanism elucidation
of such inhibitors have made it clear that they would
be invaluable tools for dissecting the biological roles of
bromodomains and being potentially of great value as
therapeutic leads.

trials for the treatment of leukemia [91], the new findings
may provide a new structural framework for the design
of next-generation bromodomain inhibitors using the vast
chemical space (Figure 4B).

CONCLUSIONS
Bromodomain, as acetyl-lysine (Kac) “reader”
domain, is part of the write−read−erase concept that has
been linked with the transfer of epigenetic information.
As part of the bromodomain-containing proteins,
conserved BET family proteins processed dual-BD and
an ET domain, suggesting a better structure feature for
drug development. BET proteins mediate PPI network
between diverse arrays of partners, and function as mitosis
bookmark, protein scaffold and chromatin regulator in
cellular processes. The information mentioned above has
provided unique amino-acid BRDs signature and ability
to regulating crucial cancer-regulation genes, revealing
good potentials for drug targets in all subfamilies,
thereby indicating that potent inhibitors targeting BET
bromodomains would be developed.
Extensive studies have explored small-molecule
inhibitors of BET family proteins for cancer therapy. Five
small-molecule inhibitors have been used in clinical trials,
such as I-BET762 in NMC and OTX-015 in hematologic
cancers, inspiring researchers for further studies of
BET inhibitors. Some hotspot inhibitors like JQ1 and
I-BET151, I-BET 762 have been reported, which promote
the clinical trial of these potential drugs, as well as gain
more detailed information of the function and regulation
activity of BET family. The experimental validation of
pan-BET inhibitors have been further explored in different
cancers, such as JQ1 and I-BET151, and experiments
have validated that combination use of BET inhibitor and
other drugs may reduce the drug resistance and raise the
sensitivity towards other therapy. As a trend of current
pharmaceutical design, developing multi-target inhibitors
of BET family and combination use of BET inhibitors
with other drugs would largely reduce the possibility of
drugs resistance.
Hitherto, the limitation of BET proteins inhibitors
also emerged, the negative finding of RVX-208 is
disappointing for the potency and selectivity of this
agent have not been disclosed in previous literatures. The
selective inhibition of RVX-208 towards BD2 rather than
BD1 in BRD3 suggests that specific targeting may be
able to perturb and modulate BET function in a contextdependent manner. And notably, little study has been
conducted about the diverse function of two BDs in one
BET protein, except in BRDT that researchers confirmed
that deletion of the first bromodomain in BRDT in mice is
sufficient to confer sterility by blocking BRDT-dependent
sperm maturation. Due to the alternative splicing,
every BET family protein processes different isoforms,
but the exact function and expression reason of these
