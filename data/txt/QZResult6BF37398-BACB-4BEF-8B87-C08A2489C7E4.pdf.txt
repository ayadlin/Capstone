Abstract
A functional genomic approach integrating microarray and
proteomic analyses done in our laboratory has identified 14-33Z as a putative oncogene whose activation was common and
driven by its genomic amplification in lung adenocarcinomas.
14-3-3Z is believed to function in cell signaling, cycle control,
and apoptotic death. Following our initial finding, here, we
analyzed its expression in lung tumor tissues obtained from
205 patients with various histologic and stage non–small
cell lung cancers (NSCLC) using immunohistochemistry and
then explored the effects of specific suppression of the gene
in vitro and in a xenograft model using small interfering RNA.
The increased 14-3-3Z expression was positively correlated
with a more advanced pathologic stage and grade of NSCLCs
(P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively) and was associated
with overall and cancer-specific survival rates of the patients
(P = 0.022 and P = 0.018, respectively). Down-regulation of
14-3-3Z in lung cancer cells led to a dose-dependent increased
sensitivity to cisplatin-induced cell death, which was associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and increased
G2-M arrest and apoptosis. The result was further confirmed
in the animal model, which showed that the A549 lung cancer
cells with reduced 14-3-3Z grew significantly slower than the
wild-type A549 cells after cisplatin treatment (P = 0.008). Our
results suggest that 14-3-3Z is a potential target for developing
a prognostic biomarker and therapeutics that can enhance
the antitumor activity of cisplatin for NSCLC. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of
cancer death in the United States. NSCLC consists of adenocarcinoma (ACC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and large cell
carcinoma (LC; refs. 1, 2). Identification of precise prognostic
marker and effective therapeutic target for NSCLC is pivotal in the
management of the deadliest form of cancer. Using a functional
genomic approach that simultaneously integrated genomic and
transcript microarrays, proteomics, and tissue microarray analyses
(TMA), we have found that the genomic amplification and
increased transcript level of 14-3-3f were associated with its high
protein expression in stage I lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting

that 14-3-3f activation might be involved in the development of
lung cancer (3).
14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved cellular proteins
and play an important role in a wide variety of cellular processes
(4). These include signal transduction, cell cycle regulation,
apoptosis, genotoxic stress response, cellular metabolism, cytoskeleton organization and malignant transformation. Recent
studies have shown that 14-3-3~ interacted with other key cellular
proteins involved in the tumor development and progression (4).
For example, 14-3-3~ is one of the major transforming growth
factor-h–induced proteins, which can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells in cancer cell transformation
(5). Furthermore, 14-3-3~ can regulate raf-1 activity by interacting
with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain to cause subsequent events
necessary for the full activation of Raf-1 in tumorigenesis (6). In
addition, 14-3-3~ can interact with the tumor suppressor tuberin to
negatively regulate phosphoinositide-3¶-kinase signaling downstream of Akt (7). Moreover, 14-3-3~ could bind to Cdc25C in
irradiated A549 cancer cells, and suppression of 14-3-3~ resulted in
a decrease in Cdc25C localization in cytoplasm and Cdc2
phosphorylation, thus sensitizing the cancer cells to ionizing
radiation (8). Most recently, up-regulation of 14-3-3~ was found to
associate with features of biologically aggressive oral carcinoma
(9). These lines of evidence strongly suggest that dysregulation of
14-3-3~ may be specifically activated in tumor and contributes to
cancer cell growth. Therefore, the prognostic value of altered
14-3-3~ expression in NSCLCs and its use as a potential target for
cancer therapy warrants further research.
Here, we found that increased 14-3-3~ protein levels were
positively associated with stage and grading of NSCLC and
inversely related to poor outcomes of the patients. We also found
that down-regulation of 14-3-3~ in NSCLC cells made them more
sensitive to cisplatin in vitro that was associated with the inhibition
of cell proliferation, additive G2-M cell cycle arrest, and increased
apoptosis. The result was confirmed in the animal model, which
showed that the A549 lung cancer cells with reduced 14-3-3~ grew
significantly slower than the wild-type A549 cells after cisplatin
treatment. Our data suggested that 14-3-3~ might be a significant
prognostic factor and an attractive target in sensitizing cancer cells
to cisplatin in treating NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Tissue specimens and immunohistochemical analysis. First, to
determine correlation between 14-3-3~ expression and clinicopathologic
features in NSCLCs, we used lung TMA (Express Biotech) constructed from
lung cancer tissues of 57 NSCLC patients with different stages and
histologies (Table 1). Second, to evaluate the associations between 14-3-3~
expression and the outcomes of NSCLC patients, we used lung TMAs

mutated shRNA that contains the same nucleotides as the shRNA-14-3-3~2,
but in an irregular sequence. Plasmids were transfected into the PT67 cells
by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were then grown in selective media for 2 weeks.
Infectious retroviruses were harvested and filtered through 0.45-Am
cellulose acetate filters.
Transfection of NSCLC cells. NSCLC cell lines, A549, H358, and H460
were transfected with 2 Ag retro-shRNA-14-3-3~s using LipofectAMINE
(Invitrogen) per instructions of the manufacturer. Meanwhile, the cells were
also transfected in parallel with retro-scrambled shRNAs or PBS (mock) to
serve as transfection controls. At 48 h following transfection, cells were
passaged into the medium containing 2 Ag/mL puromycin and allowed to
grow until distinct colonies could be distinguished. Ten single colonies of
14-3-3~, or scrambled-vector cell transfectants, were isolated and expanded.
Assessment of cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Exponentially growing cells were
plated in microtiter plates and incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2. On the
following day, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of
cisplatin (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Am; Sigma). Doses of cisplatin were chosen
based on previous experimental report (11). After 48 h, the number of
viable cells was determined using the dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described in our previous report
(12). Each condition was done in triplicate wells, and each experiment was
repeated at least thrice.
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assays. Cell cycle progression was
investigated using the flow cytometry method, as described in our previous
study (12). Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using an
Annexin V apoptosis kit (Roche) according to instructions outlined by the
manufacturer. The fluorescence emitted by cells was analyzed using a flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Western blot analysis. Western blotting was done as described
previously (3, 12). Antibodies used were obtained as follows: 14-3-3~
(C-16), 14-3-3 h (C-20), 14-3-3g (A-12), and 14-3-3q (T-16), Cdc2, and h-actin
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and caspase-3, Cdc2(06-923), phospho-cdc2
(Thr161) (9114) from Upstate Biotechnology.

consisting of tumor specimens obtained from 148 stage I NSCLC patients,
from whom we had complete medical records and follow-up data (Table 2;
ref. 10). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was done on the TMA
sections using rabbit polyclonal antibody against 14-3-3~ (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and DAKO LSAB+ and 3, 3¶-diaminobenzidine as the
chromogen as described in our previous reports (3, 10). Each batch of slides
contained a positive control and a negative control. The intensity of
reactivity was scored using a four-tier system: 0, indicated no staining; 1,
weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3, strong staining. The cells with
grades 1, 2, and 3 staining intensity were considered as positive cells for
14-3-3~. The immunoreactive score of the sample was determined by the
percentage of positive cells. Measurements were normalized to these
controls (negative control = 0, positive control = 100%). The percentage of
cell expressing 14-3-3~ of all the normal control tissues was V10%.
Therefore, the score of 10% as a cutoff value was chosen for continuing
following analyses and to define higher or lower expression of 14-3-3~ in
tumors.
Cell lines and culture conditions. A549, H358, and H460 lung cancer
cell lines and RetroPack PT67 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM
(Sigma) supplemented with 5% to 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin
(Sigma).
Generation of stable short hairpin small-interfering RNA-14-3-3Z
transfectants. To obtain stable expression of the short hairpin smallinterfering RNA (shRNA) sequences to specifically reduce the expression of
14-3-3~, three oligonucleotide pairs directed against three different regions
(nucleotides 728–746, 502–520, and 177–195) of the human 14-3-3~ mRNA
(NM_003406) were selected for use in the pSilencer 5.1-U6 Retro vector
system (Ambion). They are referred to as shRNA-14-3-3~ 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. Two types of scrambled shRNAs were designed and used to
control for nonspecific silencing events: one is general scrambled shRNA
that had no known homology with any mammalian gene, and the other is a

grades (Table 1). Positive immunohistochemistry staining for
14-3-3~ was found in the cytoplasm and confined almost exclusively to the tumor cells (Fig. 1). Overexpression of 14-3-3~ was
found in 45 of 57 NSCLCs (79%), occurred 23 of 30 adenocarcinoma
(77%) and 20 of 25 SSC (70%), 2 of 2 LC (100%), suggesting that
there was no significant difference of 14-3-3~ overexpression
between different histologic types (P = 0.089). High 14-3-3~
expression was significantly correlated with histologic grade and
clinical stage of those with NSCLC (all P < 0.05). We subsequently
analyzed the relationship between 14-3-3~ expression and outcomes of NSCLC patients in the lung TMAs consisting of stage I
NSCLC tissues (Table 2). The probability of overall survival at
5 years after surgery were 0.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI),
0.54–0.67] for patients whose tumors showed positive 14-3-3~
expression compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63–0.79) for patients
whose tumors showed negative 14-3-3~ expression. The probability
of cancer-specific survival were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.49–0.62) for patients
whose tumors showed positive 14-3-3~ expression compared with
0.95 (95% CI, 0.65–0.84) for patients whose tumors showed negative
14-3-3~ expression. The data suggest that the overall and cancerspecific survival probability were significantly different between the
two groups (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0009, respectively, log-rank test;
Fig. 2). By performing multivariate analysis (age, gender, histologic
type, and smoking status) using the Cox model, we found that the
overexpression of 14-3-3~ was the only independent predictor for

In vivo tumor model. Tumors were induced in athymic Swiss nu/nu/
Ncr nude (nu/nu) mice by inoculating 1 million of A549 lung cancer cells,
A549 cells transfected with scrambled shRNA and A549 cells transfected
with 14-3-3 shRNAs per mouse, respectively. There were 10 mice for each
group. After 17 days, five mice of each group were randomly selected and
received i.p. injection of cisplatin at a dose of 3 mg/kg for 5 consecutive
days. After a 9-day cessation of treatment, a second round of 5-day
treatment was administered followed by another 9-day cessation. Tumor
volumes were determined by direct measurement with calipers and
calculated using the formula: (larger diameter)  (small diameter)2/2.
Statistical analysis. Overall survival time was calculated from the date
of first surgery to the date of death from any cause. Cancer-specific survival
time was calculated from the date of surgery to death from cancer-related
causes. Survival curves were calculated by using the product-limit estimate
(Kaplan-Meier method), and curves were examined by using the log-rank
test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done using the Cox’s
proportional hazards model to determine which independent factors might
have a joint significant influence on survival.

disease-free and cancer-specific survival among the clinical and
histologic parameters tested (P = 0.022 and P = 0.018, respectively,
log-rank test). Collectively, the observation that increased 14-3-3~
expression was significantly correlated with a more advanced
pathologic grade and stage and poor clinical outcome of NSCLCs
implied that 14-3-3~ could play an important role in the
progression of NSCLCs and detection of the protein expression
might be used as prognostic biomarkers for the disease.
Down-regulation of 14-3-3Z sensitizes lung cancer cells to
cisplatin in vitro. NSCLC cells, A549, H460, and H358 cells were
infected with high titers of retroviruses encoding the shRNAs
against 14-3-3~, which were referred to as sh14-3-3~1, sh14-3-3~2,
and sh14-3-3~3. sh14-3-3~2 was the most effective among the three
shRNA constructs because the levels of 14-3-3~ in the cells
transfected with it always dropped by at least 75% (Fig. 3A).
Therefore, the stable cell lines transfected with sh14-3-3~2 were
used in the following experiments. Furthermore, this downregulation was specific because there is no significant change of
14-3-3~ protein in the mock cells and the cells infected with the
two types of scrambled shRNAs (control cells) and no changes in
the expression of the other members of 14-3-3 family in the cells
transfected with shRNA–14-3-3~2. We then assessed the effects of
reduced expression of 14-3-3~ on cell growth by comparing the
14-3-3~ knockdown cells with the control cells for the proliferation
and apoptosis. We did not observe a significant difference in cell
proliferation and apoptosis between the cells transfected with
sh14-3-3~2 and the controls.
Cisplatin has been the standard of care for the treatment of
NSCLCs (13). We therefore evaluated whether the specific 14-3-3~
knockdown could alter the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin.
The stable cell lines with suppression of 14-3-3~ (A549/sh-14-3-3~2,

H358/sh14-3-3~2, and H460/sh14-3-3~2) and their corresponding
control cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of cisplatin
for 48 h, and cell survival was determined by MTT assay. As shown
in Fig. 3B, cisplatin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in proliferative capacity in all cancer cells. However,
inhibition of tumor cell growth by cisplatin was more significantly
enhanced in the cells with specific suppression of 14-3-3~ than the
control cells (all P < 0.05). The data therefore implied that 14-3-3~
knockdown could enhance tumor cell sensitivity to cisplatin in a
dose-dependent manner.
One of the key pathways in cisplatin-mediated tumor killing is by
inducing arrest of cell cycle checkpoints, whereas 14-3-3~ has been
suggested to play an important role in the regulation of cell
division (13, 14). To determine effect of 14-3-3~ suppression on
cisplatin-induced cell cycle arrest, we evaluated the cell cycle status
of the 14-3-3~ knockdown cancer cells when treated with cisplatin.
Cisplatin treatment of all cancer cells led to a dose-dependent
increase in the percentage of cells in G2-M phase. However, as
shown in Fig. 3C, the cancer cells lacking 14-3-3~ expression were
more sensitive to the G2-M arrest induced by cisplatin, with a
dramatic increase in the population of the cells in G2-M, as
compared with the cells without 14-3-3~ knockdown. This
observation suggested that the suppression of 14-3-3~ could
enhance G2-M arrest in the cancer cells induced by cisplatin. To
better understand the mechanism behind the observation, the
status of Cdc2 phosphorylation, a critical biochemical process in
the DNA damage G2-M checkpoint, was examined by Western
blotting using anti-Cdc2 antibody and anti–phospho-Cdc2 antibody (Thr161). Western blotting showed a statistical increase of the
phosphorylated form of Cdc2 rather than Cdc2 in the cells with
reduced 14-3-3~ expression (Fig. 4A), which was concomitant with

Figure 3. Down-regulation of 14-3-3~ in lung

G2-M arrest determined by flow cytometry, suggesting that the
reduction of 14-3-3~ sensitized the cisplatin-induced G2-M arrest
through a mechanism of activation Cdc2 (phosphorylation of
Cdc2).
Another major mechanism of cisplatin to kill tumor cells is by
inducing apoptotic cell death. 14-3-3~ has been suggested to be
implicated in the activation of the apoptosis pathway (15). To
determine whether 14-3-3~ knockdown can affect the cisplatininduced apoptosis of cancer cells, we first evaluated the apoptosis
of the cells with specific suppression of 14-3-3~ when treated with
cisplatin using the annexin V staining assay. Cisplatin treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in both the cells
with reduced level of 14-3-3~2 and control cells. Interestingly, 14-33~ depletion cells were noted in 40% or more increase of cells that
entered apoptosis than that of mock and scrambled shRNA cells at
6 Amol/L or higher cisplatin. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3
was clearly increased in the 14-3-3 suppression cells compared with
controls when treated with 6 Amol/L or higher cisplatin (Fig. 4B).
Therefore, the finding implies that the inhibition of 14-3-3~ can
sensitize lung cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and the
effect might be through a caspase-dependent mechanism.
Knockdown of 14-3-3Z increases sensitivity of cancer cells to
cisplatin in vivo. A549 cancer cells, scrambled shRNA A549 cells,
and A549/sh14-3-3~2 cells were inoculated in nude mice,
respectively. After 17 days, the tumor volume induced by A549
cells, scrambled shRNA A549 cells, and A549/sh14-3-3~2 cells were
169.49 F 20.61, 154.54 F 20.06, and 151.49 F 34.78 mm3,
respectively (P = 0.091). By 28 days after the initiation of cisplatin
treatment, the ratio of tumor growth among A549 and scrambled

www.aacrjournals.org

shRNA A549 tumors was 54% and 50%, respectively, whereas it was
22% for A549/sh14-3-3~2 (P = 0.008; Fig. 4C). The observation
suggests that despite showing a similar growth pattern as did the
tumors induced by controls, the tumors induced by the specific
suppression of 14-3-3~ A549 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin
treatment than the tumors induced by the control cells without
14-3-3~ depletion. These in vivo data are consistent with the
results obtained in vitro and support the suggestion that the
inhibition of expression of 14-3-3~ can sensitize the tumor to
the action of the cisplatin.

Discussion
The ability to identify NSCLC patients at high risk of recurrence
following surgery is important because such a test would identify
patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapies, whereas
sparing patients who are at low risk of recurrence from toxic
treatment. However, the current prognostic assessments of NSCLC
do not allow a precise distinction between the patients who will
benefit from therapy and those who will not (16). In the present
study, the up-regulation of 14-3-3~ was only observed in lung cancer
tissues but absent in the nonmalignant tissues and is positively
correlated with stage and grading of NSCLCs. Furthermore, we
found that the 14-3-3~ expression inversely correlated with survival.
More importantly, 14-3-3~ functions as an independent prognostic
factor for predicting outcome in early-stage patients with lung
cancer in a multivariate analysis. Our clinical evidence clearly
supports the notion that the increased expression of 14-3-3~
contributes to lung cancer development and progression, and the

detection of the 14-3-3~ aberrations might be a useful biomarker to
identify poor prognoses in patients with NSCLC.
Cisplatin is included in most protocols employed to date for the
treatment of NSCLC (13). However, the patient’s response to this
drug is often far from optimum because of the dose-dependent side
effects and the development of resistance to the chemotherapeutic
agent (17). We considered that sensitizing the cancer cells to
cisplatin would be a way of obtaining a better response from the
tumor to the drug and also of combating any resistance by the lung
cancer cells by reducing the dose. In the present study, although all
the NSCLC cell lines tested are sensitive to cisplatin, the sensitivity of
the 14-3-3~ depletion cells to cisplatin significantly increases, as
represented by increased cancer cell growth inhibition in vitro.
Consistently, tumors induced by the cancer cells lacking 14-3-3~
expression in xenograft models showed a significantly slower
kinetics of growth than the ones induced by the cancer cells without
reduced 14-3-3~ when treated by cisplatin. Interestingly, the
enhanced sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin is in a dosedependent manner. Therefore, our study suggests that using RNA
interference to inhibit 14-3-3~ may be beneficial in reducing the
required dose of cisplatin for the same effect, thus reducing the
extensive problems associated with toxicity. This strategy may also
be able to reduce the occurrence of drug resistance. The
investigation of whether 14-3-3~ suppression can also enhance the
anticancer effect of cisplatin analogues is ongoing in the laboratory.
It is accepted that the cytotoxicity of cisplatin is due to DNA
damage through mediating the induction of cell cycle arrest (13).
After DNA damage, the G2-M transition is regulated by maturationpromoting factors, such as Cdc2, which can determine entry into
mitosis. Especially, elevated Cdc2 phosphorylation can arrest cells
in the G2 phase (18). In the present study, the 14-3-3~ knockdown
enhanced cell accumulation at the G2-M phase after cisplatin
treatment; concurrently, Cdc2 (Thr161) phosphorylation was
significantly induced in 14-3-3~ down-regulation cells following
cisplatin treatment. In contrast, the phosphorylated form of Cdc2
in control cells was not induced. The observation is consistent with
the report of others that 14-3-3~ plays an important role in G2-M
phase checkpoints by interacting with cell cycle regulatory

proteins, including Cdc2, especially the phosphorylation of Cdc2
(8). Therefore, the results of our studies indicated that the
sensitization of cancer cells by specific suppression of 14-3-3~ to
cisplatin might be through an increased cell cycle arrest at G2-M
phase mediated by elevated Cdc2 phosphorylation.
It is also believed that cisplatin kills cancer cells through apoptotic
mechanism (15). 14-3-3~ was proposed to be involved in apoptosis
through multiple interactions with proteins of the core mitochondrial machinery, proapoptotic transcription factors, and their
upstream signaling pathways (8, 19–22). In the current study, the
cancer cells, with the inactivation of 14-3-3~, had increased apoptosis
accompanied with higher amount of the cleaved caspase-3 than did
control cells after exposure to cisplatin. Therefore, the results suggest
that the chemosensitization effect of the down-regulation of 14-3-3~
involved the activation of the apoptosis pathway alterations of cell
proliferation in a highly caspase-3–dependent manner. Taken
together, our result might reveal that the suppression of 14-3-3~
mediates sensitivity to chemotherapy by a mechanism of introducing
the arrest of G2-M phase checkpoint and apoptosis. Further
investigations of the relationship between 14-3-3~ and other factors
(e.g., p53) and the biological significance in the DNA damage cell
cycle response and apoptosis are ongoing in the laboratory.
In summary, 14-3-3~ may not only be a useful molecular marker
for selecting patients with poor prognosis to receive more
aggressive preoperative or adjuvant therapy in the setting of a
clinical trial, but may also be an effective therapeutic target for
NSCLC. Nevertheless, a longitudinal study in a large population to
validate its prognostic value and further molecular biological
analysis of the gene to develop a novel strategy for improving
treatment efficiencies of certain anticancer drugs will be needed.
