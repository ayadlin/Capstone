Abstract
In mammalian cells, the level of estrogen receptor A (ERA) is
rapidly decreased upon estrogen treatment, and this regulation involves proteasome degradation. Using different
approaches, we showed that the Mdm2 oncogenic ubiquitinligase directly interacts with ERA in a ternary complex with
p53 and is involved in the regulation of ERA turnover (both
in the absence or presence of estrogens). Several lines of
evidence indicated that this effect of Mdm2 required its
ubiquitin-ligase activity and involved the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Moreover, in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells,
various p53-inducing agents (such as UV irradiation) or
treatment with RITA (which inhibits the interaction of p53
with Mdm2) stabilized ERA and abolished its 17B-estradiol–
dependent turnover. Interestingly, our data indicated that
ligand-dependent receptor turnover was not required for
efficient transactivation. Altogether, our results indicate that
the Mdm2 oncoprotein and stress-inducing agents complexly
and differentially regulate ERA stability and transcriptional
activity in human cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5513–21]

Introduction
Estrogens are key regulators of cell differentiation and
proliferation, and these hormones play important roles in female
reproduction physiology and tissue homeostasis. They exert their
biological action via specific receptors (ERa and ERh), which are
members of a superfamily of hormone nuclear receptors, acting
as gene regulatory transcription factors (1). Upon ligand binding,
ERs regulate gene expression through the binding to their cognate
estrogen response elements (ERE) or via protein-protein interactions with transcription factors such as activator protein-1 or
specificity protein-1. In the presence of hormone, ERs undergo a
major conformational change allowing the recruitment of transcriptional cofactor complexes, which in turn engage the basal
transcription machinery and/or act to locally modify chromatin
structure and subsequently stimulate expression of estrogenresponsive genes.
Liganded nuclear receptors recruit various types of enzymatic
activities that participate in gene expression regulation (2).
Previous studies have suggested that ubiquitin-conjugating

enzymes or ubiquitin-protein ligases, such as UbcH5/UbcH7 (3, 4),
RPF1/RSP5 (5), or E6-AP (6), interact with members of the nuclear
receptor superfamily and modulate their transactivation functions.
Similarly, ATPase subunits of the proteasome complex, such as
TRIP1/SUG1 (7) or TBP1 (8), also bind nuclear receptors and
modulate their functions.
More than 30 years ago, Jensen et al. have shown that 17hestradiol (E2) treatment significantly reduces ERa levels in the
uterus of ovariectomized rats (9). More recently, several studies
have shown that binding of E2 to ERa significantly decreases its
stability. This shorter half-life in the presence of hormone seems
to implicate the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway because ERa has
been shown to be ubiquitinated (10), and the ligand-dependent
down-regulation is blocked by proteasome inhibitors (3, 11, 12).
Interestingly, although partial antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen,
also increase ERa accumulation, pure antihormones, such as the
ICI 182,780 compound, strongly decrease receptor stability (10, 13).
Several reports have suggested that the proteasome may control
not only ERa protein levels but also hormone-dependent transcription (14). This effect is associated with the immobilization of
ERa on the nuclear matrix as determined by fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (15). Although several candidates have been
proposed to account for the E2-dependent regulation of ERa
expression, the exact molecular mechanisms still remain unraveled.
The Mdm2 oncogene is overexpressed in a wide variety of
human cancers (16), and its role in tumorigenesis is linked to its
ability to act as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase (17), which mediates the
ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of several
growth regulatory proteins including p53 (18, 19). Interestingly, it
has been previously suggested that Mdm2 could directly interact
with ERa (20, 21), and a positive effect of Mdm2 overexpression on
ERa activity has also been reported (20).
In the present study, we show that the Mdm2 oncoprotein
is involved in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent
decrease of ERa stability. Our data indicate that Mdm2 regulates
ERa expression as a ternary complex with p53, and in support of
this observation, we show that various stress-inducing agents
(which stabilize p53) block E2-dependent regulation of ERa
stability in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Finally, this study
provides several lines of evidence showing that the E2-dependent
turnover of the receptor is not necessary for ERE-mediated
transactivation.

Moléculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), Montpellier, France]. The pXJ-Mdm2
vector was obtained from B. Wasylyk (IGBMC), and the pcMI-Hdm2
contained the Mdm2 cDNA (BamHI/EcoRI fragment) subcloned into the
pCMI1 vector (26). The pcMI-Hdm2DRING was obtained by inserting into
the pCMI1 vector a PCR-amplified BamHI/EcoRI fragment corresponding
to amino acids 1 to 435. The GST-Mdm2 was constructed by cloning a
XhoI/NotI fragment of the human Mdm2 cDNA into the pGEX4T3 vector
(Amersham Biosciences). The Gal-Mdm2 was generated by introducing a
blunted NcoI/BglII fragment from pXJMdm2 into the SmaI site of the
pSG424 plasmid (27). The RITA compound (NSC652287) was obtained from
Dr. R.J. Schultz (NIH, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Drug Synthesis

Cell culture. Monolayer cell cultures (MCF-7, HeLa, and BG1) were
grown, respectively, in Ham’s F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(1:1, F12/DMEM) or DMEM alone supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen)
and antibiotics. Before hormonal treatments, cells were stripped of endogenous estrogens as previously described (28). When indicated, cells were

irradiated using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (model 1800) from
Stratagene. The MELN cell line derived from MCF-7 cells stably transfected
with the ERE-hGlob-Luc-SVneo plasmid (29). Mouse embryo fibroblasts

G. Lozano (Houston, TX) and cultured in F12/DMEM.
Transient transfection and luciferase assays. Cells were plated in sixwell plates (105 per well) 24 h before DNA transfection (4 Ag of total DNA)

normalized by the h-galactosidase activities as described (28), and all data
were expressed as mean F SD.

lysis buffer (HSB) containing 500 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), 1%
NP40, 1 mmol/L DTT, and proteases inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics).
Proteins were quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories),
and 30 Ag were usually loaded on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were saturated in TBST buffer

Results
ERA is involved in a ternary complex with p53 and Mdm2.
To better characterize protein-protein interactions between Mdm2
and ERa, we first did GST pull-down experiments. As shown in
Fig. 1A (left), we observed a ligand-independent interaction of
in vitro translated ERa with Mdm2 expressed as a fusion protein
with GST, whereas no detectable interaction was obtained with
GST alone. The binding of Mdm2 to ERa was mediated by the
ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the receptor, as shown by the
recruitment of in vitro expressed Mdm2 by the GST-LBD protein,
which was also unaffected by E2 (right). Moreover, the use of a
GST-LBD mutated in the conserved AF2 activation domain
indicated that this interaction did not require an intact AF2
transactivation domain (data not shown). The use of ERa deletion
mutants (shown in Fig. 1B, left) confirmed that both the DBD
(HE11 mutant) and the NH2-terminal region (HE19 mutant) were
not necessary for the binding to Mdm2 (Fig. 1B, right). By contrast,

www.aacrjournals.org

our data confirmed that the COOH-terminal LBD of ERa was
required for the in vitro interaction because the HE15 mutant
poorly associated with GST-Mdm2. Altogether, these results
showed a direct ligand- and AF-2–independent interaction of
ERa with Mdm2.
To confirm that these interactions also occurred in intact cells,
we first set up coimmunoprecipitation experiments. As illustrated
in Fig. 1C, ERa was found associated with immunoprecipitated
Mdm2, as determined by probing the Western blot with a polyclonal antibody specific for the receptor (lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, when the same experiment was carried out in MEFdKO
embryonic fibroblasts (32) derived from p53 / and Mdm2 /
mice (lanes 3 and 4), ERa was not coprecipitated with Mdm2,
suggesting that p53 could be required for the interaction between
ERa and Mdm2. Indeed, the formation of a ternary complex among
ERa, p53, and Mdm2 was further shown by coimmunoprecipitation
of both p53 and Mdm2 with endogenous ERa from MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 1C, right).
Moreover, the fact that ERa could be engaged in a ternary
complex with p53 and Mdm2 was also confirmed using a modified
mammalian two-hybrid system (Fig. 1D). An expression plasmid
coding for Mdm2 fused to the Gal4 DBD (Gal-Mdm2) was
cotransfected in MCF-7 cells together with a Gal4-responsive
reporter plasmid and an expression vector coding for ERa fused to
the VP16 activation domain or for VP16 alone. In our experimental
conditions, a slight but significant increase in luciferase activity
(>2-fold versus 7-fold with Gal-GRIP used as a positive control)
was obtained when ER-VP16 was coexpressed with Gal-Mdm2
(compared with the activity obtained with VP16 alone). Interestingly, when a p53 expression plasmid was cotransfected with
Gal-Mdm2 and ER-VP16, we observed a significant increase in
luciferase activity (>8-fold), suggesting that p53 indeed stabilize
the interaction between ERa and Mdm2. Altogether, these results

suggest that ERa, p53, and Mdm2 coexist within the same protein
complex in intact cells.
p53 and Mdm2 are required for ligand-dependent ERA
turnover. To evaluate the role of Mdm2 and p53 in a liganddependent down-regulation of ERa, we first used the MEFdKO
model (32). As shown in Fig. 2A, in this p53/Mdm2 / background,
estrogen treatment did not decrease ERa accumulation (as
observed in parallel in p53/Mdm2+/+ wild-type MEFs) but instead
slightly increased receptor levels. To show that the expression of
p53 and Mdm2 was required for the E2-dependent inhibition of
ERa accumulation, we transiently transfected the expression
vectors for both p53 and Mdm2 together with the expression
vector for ERa in p53/Mdm2 / MEFs (Fig. 2B). In this condition,
we not only abolished the positive effect of E2 on ERa accumulation that we observed in control p53/Mdm2 / cells, but we
also restored the negative hormonal regulation of ERa expression.
Mdm2 regulates ligand-independent expression of ERA.
Because some of the data shown in Fig. 1 suggested that Mdm2
could also bind ERa in an E2-independent manner, we investigated
the effect of Mdm2 overexpression on ERa accumulation in the
absence of ligand. As shown in Fig. 2C (top), when increasing
amounts of Mdm2 expression vectors were transiently cotransfected with ERa in untreated HeLa cells, the accumulation of
the receptor was significantly decreased. This effect involved the
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway because the Mdm2-dependent
down-regulation of ERa was completely relieved by the proteasome

inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2C, bottom). To emphasize the importance of
Mdm2 in ligand-independent turnover of ERa, we measured the
effect of Mdm2 overexpression on the apparent stability of the ERa
protein by chase experiment in HeLa cells using cycloheximide as
a protein synthesis inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 2D, we noticed a
significant decrease in ERa apparent stability in the presence of
Mdm2. This effect of Mdm2 on ERa stability was also observed in
the presence of E2 (data not shown), thus emphasizing the role of
Mdm2 in the E2-dependent and E2-independent posttranslational
regulation of ERa expression.
Mechanisms involved in Mdm2 regulation of ERA stability.
To further decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in ERa
degradation by Mdm2, we first used a mutant of Mdm2
(Mdm2DRING) deleted in the COOH-terminal part of the protein,
which contains the RING domain required for its ubiquitin-ligase
activity (33). As shown in Fig. 3A, this mutant still interacted with
ERa in GST pull-down experiment. Interestingly, overexpression of
the Mdm2DRING mutant did not decrease ERa accumulation
compared with the effect of its wild-type counterpart (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of Mdm2 is directly
involved in ERa degradation. The implication of the ubiquitin/
proteasome pathway was further shown in ubiquitination assays.
As shown in Fig. 3C, after immunoprecipitation of ERa, slowly
migrating forms of the receptor were detected both using anti-ERa
(bottom) or anti-ubiquitin (top) antibodies, thus confirming that the
level of ERa ubiquitination increased upon Mdm2 overexpression.

Figure 3. Mechanisms of Mdm2-dependent
degradation of ERa. A, a GST pull-down experiment
was done to determine the in vitro interaction between
35
S-labeled Mdm2 or Mdm2DRING (deleted of the
COOH-terminal region) with the GST-AF2 fusion
protein that contains the ligand-binding domain of
ERa. B, HeLa cells were transfected either with the
ERa expression plasmid alone (1.5 Ag) or together
with Mdm2 or Mdm2DRING expression vector
(1.5 Ag). The accumulation of ERa and Mdm2 proteins
(wild type or Mdm2DRING) was analyzed by
Western blot. C, ERa expression vector (1.5 Ag)
was transfected into HeLa cells with or without Mdm2
(1.5 Ag). The ubiquitination status of ERa was then
determined by immunoprecipitation of ERa from
whole-cell extracts (as described in Materials and
Methods) followed by Western blotting using
anti-ubiquitin antibody (top ) or with an ERa antibody
(bottom ). D, HeLa cells were transiently transfected
with ERa expression vector alone (500 ng; lanes 1, 2,
4 , and 5 ) or together with the Mdm2 expression
vector (1 Ag; lanes 3 and 6). Cells were treated with E2
(10 8 mol/L, lanes 2 and 5) or with vehicle alone
(lanes 1, 3, 4 , and 6 ). The expression of ERa and
Mdm2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The same
experiment was done using the wild-type receptor or
the HE11 ERa mutant (deleted of the DBD).

signaling. A, MCF-7 cells were treated for 20 h with
10 7 mol/L E1, E2, E3, or diethylstilbestrol (DES ) in the
absence (control) or presence of MG132 (4 Amol/L).
ERa and p53 protein levels were analyzed by Western
blot. B, MCF-7 cells were cultured with MG132
(MG ; 4 Amol/L), actinomycin D (ActD ; 10 nmol/L), or
exposed to UV (150 J/m2) for 20 h, and apoptosis was
measured by cytoplasmic nucleosomes quantification.
Values were normalized by DNA quantification assay
(measurement of DNA with DABA). C, MCF-7 cells
were irradiated (UV), treated with MG132 (4 Amol/L),
actinomycin D (10 nmol/L), or untreated (control) in
the presence of vehicle or E2 (10 8 mol/L). Extracts
were prepared and Western blotted with antibodies for
ERa and p53. D, MCF-7 cells were irradiated by UV or
not (control) and cultured in the presence of vehicle,
E2 (10 8 mol/L), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (10 8 mol/L),
or ICI 182,780 (ICI ; 10 8 mol/L) for 20 h. ERa and p53
accumulation were analyzed by Western blot.

Finally, in an attempt to compare the E2-dependent turnover of
the receptor with the ligand-independent degradation observed
upon Mdm2 overexpression, we used a mutant of ERa deleted in
the central DNA-binding domain involved in the binding of p53
(see Fig. 1B).4 This ERa-DDBD mutant (HE11) was no longer
degraded upon E2 stimulation (Fig. 3D, lane 5) in support with
the role of this domain in recruiting p53 and consistent with the
formation of a ternary complex among the receptor, p53, and
Mdm2 (Fig. 1). By contrast, the ligand-independent increase in ERa
turnover observed upon Mdm2 overexpression was comparable for
the wild-type protein and the DBD-deleted mutant (Fig. 3D, lane 3
for ERa wild type and lane 6 for HE11). Altogether, these data
support the hypothesis that different mechanisms might be
involved in the regulation of ERa turnover upon E2 treatment or
Mdm2 overexpression.
Stress-inducing agents block ligand-dependent turnover of
ERA. Previous studies reported that in MCF-7 human breast
cancer cells, the E2-dependent decrease of ERa accumulation was
abolished by the MG132 proteasome inhibitor (3, 11, 12). Results
shown in Fig. 4A confirmed that MG132 was able to reverse the
effect of various ligands, such as E2, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), or
diethylstilbestrol, on ERa levels in MCF-7 cells. Interestingly,
proteasome blockade is a cellular stress that increased accumulation of p53 (Fig. 4A, compare right and left) and, consequently,
induced apoptosis, as shown by quantification of cytoplasmic
nucleosomes (Fig. 4B).
Based on our results concerning the role of Mdm2 in the
regulation of ERa turnover, we thought that the effect of MG132

could be linked (at least in part) to its ability to dissociate Mdm2
from p53 and/or ERa. We therefore analyzed the effect of other
stress-inducing agents (genotoxic or non-genotoxic) for their ability
to regulate E2-dependent turnover. As shown in Fig. 4B, both UV
irradiation and inhibition of transcription (actinomycin D treatment) increased significantly programmed cell death in MCF-7
cells. In all conditions, the accumulation of p53 was significantly
increased to levels comparable with those obtained after MG132
treatment and, very interestingly, both treatments that increase
p53 levels concomitantly suppressed the hormone-dependent
down-regulation of ERa (Fig. 4C).
We then characterized the effect of UV irradiation on the
regulation of ERa accumulation. We first showed that the blockade
of E2-dependent turnover after UV exposition was rapid since
observed 4 h after irradiation and still detectable 24 h later (data
not shown). We then investigated the effect of UV irradiation on
the response to antiestrogens, which have also been shown to
regulate ERa expression. Indeed, as previously reported, incubation
with the partial antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen increased the
level of ERa, whereas pure antiestrogens, such as the ICI 182,780
molecule, negatively regulated the accumulation of the receptor
(10). As shown in Fig. 4D, UV irradiation did not affect the
stabilization of ERa upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment. Very
interestingly, it did not antagonize the effect of ICI 182,780, whereas
it completely reversed the agonist-dependent decrease of ERa
levels. This suggested that degradation of ERa by pure antiestrogens involved different mechanisms than those required for
hormone-dependent degradation.
Concomitant stabilization of ERA and p53 by stressinducing agents. To confirm that UV irradiation modulated the
stability of the ERa protein, we did chase experiments with
cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the stability of the

receptor in the absence of de novo protein synthesis decreased
upon E2 treatment, and UV irradiation completely inhibited the
hormone-dependent degradation. As expected, upon UV treatment,
p53 seemed very stable, and its accumulation was strongly
increased (Fig. 5A). Altogether, these data suggest that stressinducing agents induce a co-stabilization of p53 and ERa in MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Our hypothesis was that disruption of the p53/
Mdm2/ERa complex upon cellular stress was at the basis of the
loss of E2-dependent turnover of the receptor.
To further emphasize this point, we used the NSC652287
compound, also known as RITA (which stands for reactivation of

p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis) and recently described
as an inhibitor of the p53/Mdm2 interaction (34). As shown in
Fig. 5C, treatment of MCF-7 cells with RITA at 1 Amol/L significantly abolished the ligand-dependent decrease in ERa accumulation. This effect was detectable 4 h after the beginning of the
treatment and very interestingly, it correlated again with the
increase in p53 accumulation. As a control of UV irradiation and
RITA treatment, we checked by quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR that no up-regulation of the ERa mRNA was associated with
the blockade of the E2-dependent decrease observed at the protein
level (data not shown). Combined, these data therefore suggest that
dissociation of the p53/Mdm2/ERa complex upon cellular stress
leads to a co-stabilization of p53 and ERa proteins.
Dissociation between ligand-dependent ERA expression and
transactivation. Because previous studies proposed that the E2dependent decrease of ERa accumulation was required for transcriptional activity of the receptor (14), we analyzed whether these
two variables were indeed linked in our hands. We first investigated
the ability of transiently transfected ERa to increase the transcription of a reporter gene in MEFs expressing or not p53/Mdm2.
As shown in Fig. 6A, we found that ERa strongly activated transcription in cells where E2 up-regulated its accumulation (Control).
Very interestingly, we found that overexpression of p53/Mdm2
only slightly modify ERa transactivation although it completely
inversed the effect of E2 on its accumulation (see Fig. 2B).
We then analyzed the effect of UV irradiation on endogenous
ERa activity. To this aim, we used MELN cells that are MCF-7 cells
stably transfected with an E2-regulated luciferase reporter gene,
allowing easy monitoring of endogenous ERa activity (24). MELN
cells were treated with E2 4 h after irradiation by UV (i.e., when
E2-dependent turnover of ERa was no longer detectable; see Fig. 4).
As shown in Fig. 6B, the transcriptional activity of ERa was
significantly increased both in the absence of ligand or in the
presence of E2. In all conditions, the induction by E2 was
detectable, confirming that E2-dependent turnover was not a
prerequisite for transactivation even on endogenous ERa. Moreover, the same results were obtained on the endogenous E2regulated pS2 gene (Fig. 6C), thus confirming the dissociation of
stress-inducing agents on the accumulation of ERa and on its
transactivation.
Finally, we screened several ERa-expressing human cancer cell
lines for the negative E2-dependent regulation of ERa accumulation. As shown in Fig. 6D, we found that BG1 ovarian cancer cells
exhibited a strong positive regulation of ERa levels in response to
E2 treatment, contrasting with the negative regulation observed in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (see Figs. 4 and 5). Of interest, when we
analyzed the transactivation properties of ERa in these two cell
lines, we found that at least on the reporter that we used in
transient transfection, the respective endogenous receptors were
able to transactivate to similar extent (Fig. 6D). Altogether, our
results strongly suggest that the effect of E2 on ERa turnover could
be dissociated from its effect on transcriptional activation at least
on some target promoters.

Discussion
Modulation of ERa levels is a critical variable in determining the
hormonal response of breast cancer cell proliferation. The control
of ERa expression is under a complex regulation that takes place
both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Previous
data suggested that ERa was down-regulated in the presence of E2

through a proteasome-dependent mechanism (3, 11, 12). In this
study, we have investigated the mechanisms regulating the
hormone-induced ERa turnover, and several lines of evidence
indicate that Mdm2, an oncogenic ubiquitin-ligase, plays an
important role in the regulation of ERa accumulation by E2.
First, using coimmunoprecipitation and a modified two-hybrid
assay, we show that Mdm2 interacted with ERa in a ternary
complex with p53. The direct in vitro interaction between the
receptor and both Mdm2 and p53 was also shown using GST
pull-down assays. Our data suggested that Mdm2 binding involved
the LBD of ERa but did not require the ligand-dependent AF2
interface. Interestingly, p53 interacted with a different region of
the receptor (i.e., the central region; data not shown), thus supporting the formation of a ternary complex.
The use of p53/Mdm2 / cells showed that the two proteins
were required for the E2-dependent down-regulation of ERa.
Moreover, we showed that the COOH-terminal region of Mdm2,
which encompassed the E3 activity, was required for the
degradation of ERa and that overexpression of Mdm2 increased
ERa ubiquitination. Previous studies highlighted the role of the
Mdm2 ubiquitin-ligase in the degradation of steroid hormone
nuclear receptors. In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),
Sengupta and Wasylyk showed that disruption of the p53/Mdm2
interaction prevented ubiquitination of GR and that the liganddependent trimeric complex between GR, p53 and Mdm2 enhanced
proteasomal degradation of the receptor (35). Moreover, the E3
ligase activity of Mdm2 was also necessary for the ubiquitination
and degradation of the androgen receptor (36).
From the data presented in our study, we propose that p53 and
Mdm2 are involved in the ligand-dependent degradation of ERa.
Interestingly, in support of our data, it has been recently shown, by
chromatin immunoprecipitation, that Mdm2 was recruited on the

www.aacrjournals.org

ERa-regulated pS2 promoter upon E2 stimulation (37, 38).
Moreover, both Mdm2 and p53 expression levels are increased by
E2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (39). This positive regulation could
be of importance in the E2-dependent down-regulation of the
receptor. Obviously, other factors associated with p53 or Mdm2
could be involved in such a degradation complex. A strong
candidate is the coactivator AIB1, which has been shown to
interact with p53 (40) and to be required for the E2-dependent
turnover of ERa (41). The involvement of AIB1 could explain why
the AF2-mutated ERa is no longer degraded upon hormone
stimulation.5 Interestingly, in breast cancer, AIB1 amplification
correlates with that of Mdm2 (42), and AIB1 expression is regulated
by ubiquitination (43).
Our results dealing with the effect of stress-inducing agents on
ERa expression clearly indicated that the increased turnover of
the receptor in the presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780
involves different mechanisms than those implicated in the E2dependent degradation. Indeed, the effect of ICI182,780 on ERa
levels were not abolished in UV-irradiated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4D)
and in MEFdKO (data not shown). Similar dissociation between
the effects of E2 and ICI 182,780 were previously reported (44), and
other pathways involving, for example, the NEDD8 ubiquitin-like
protein (45) or CSN5/Jab1 (46) could account for the degradation in
the presence of pure antihormones.
Previous data have highlighted the existence of a ligandindependent degradation of ERa and showed the role of CHIP
(COOH terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) in the ubiquitination of misfolded ERa (47). More recently, E6-AP has also been

shown to be involved in a calmodulin-dependent degradation
pathway of ERa (48). Our data suggest that, when overexpressed,
Mdm2 is also involved in the ligand-independent turnover of
ERa. In these conditions, several evidences indicate that p53 could
be dispensable for the effect of Mdm2, and this could reflect the
fact that, upon overexpression of Mdm2, the binding equilibrium
between ERa and Mdm2 could be strongly displaced towards
complex formation, thus avoiding the requirement for p53 to
stabilize the interaction. Finally, although we show that Mdm2
increased ERa ubiquitination, further work will be required to
define which particular lysine residues are modified by Mdm2 in
the presence or absence of E2.
The present work also highlights the regulation of ERa
expression by cellular stress. We show that several stress-inducing
agents that stabilize p53 also increase ERa levels and block its
E2-dependent down-regulation. The stabilization of p53 upon
treatment with stress-inducing agents results from its dissociation
from Mdm2 due to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation (49). It is interesting to note that phosphorylation of
nuclear receptors has also been linked to their turnover (36, 50, 51).
Concerning ERa, it has very recently been reported that S118 is an
essential determinant of ERa degradation (38), and a previous
work has shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 7
enhances the destruction of the receptor in a ligand-independent
manner (52). By contrast, another report suggests that in MCF-7
cells, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase results in an
increased degradation of ERa (53). Altogether, these data suggest
that phosphorylation is directly or indirectly involved in ERa
turnover. Interestingly, we found that the degradation observed
upon Mdm2 overexpression was no longer detected when we
tested ERa mutated on the phosphorylated Ser118 residues (data
not shown).
Finally, although it has been suggested that the E2-dependent
turnover of ERa was required for efficient transactivation of the
receptor (14), the data presented herein do not support such a
conclusion. We first show that in p53/Mdm2 / cells where E2
treatment led to an increase in ERa accumulation, a strong
hormone-dependent transactivation was observed. Interestingly,
the same result was obtained with endogenous ERa in BG1 ovarian
cancer cells. In addition, in MCF-7 cells, the blockade of ERa

E2-dependent degradation upon UV irradiation (or MG132; data
not shown) did not abolish the transcriptional response to E2
cells both on a stably transfected ERE-containing reporter gene
and on the well-known pS2 target gene. Altogether, the present
work dissociates the effect of E2 on ERa turnover from the effect
of hormone on transactivation, thus supporting previous studies
done using MG132, which suggested that the two events are not
linked (54).
In conclusion, we propose that within a same protein complex,
ERa and p53 are both targeted by the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase;
consequently, the stability of ERa and p53 is concomitantly
increased in response to stress-inducing agents. This study
therefore emphasizes the relevance of protein-protein interactions
among nuclear receptors, the Mdm2 oncogene, and the p53 tumor
suppressor. Several physiologic and pathologic consequences of
these interactions have been proposed for the glucocorticoid
receptor (55). Our data showing the involvement of the Mdm2
oncoprotein in the regulation of ligand-dependent and ligandindependent ERa expression are in accordance with a recent study
that reported that Mdm2 protein expression is a negative prognostic marker in breast carcinoma whose expression showed a
negative correlation with ERa (56). Such an inverse association
might seem surprising because this receptor is believed to mediate
proliferative signaling of estrogens. However, our laboratory has
shown that in the absence of ligand, ERa also exerts anti-invasive
activity in breast cancer cell lines (57), and this effect could
therefore be lowered in tumor cells overexpressing Mdm2.
Altogether, the present work highlights the role of Mdm2 on
hormone signaling and will be at the basis of future investigations
to decipher its importance in various physiopathologic situations.
