Abstract
The preclinical development of peptidyl drugs for cancer treatment is hampered by their poor pharmacologic
properties and cell penetrative capabilities in vivo. In this study, we report a nanoparticle-based formulation that
overcomes these limitations, illustrating their utility in studies of the anticancer peptide NuBCP-9, which converts
BCL-2 from a cell protector to a cell killer. NuBCP-9 was encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles composed of a
polyethylene glycol (PEG)–modiﬁed polylactic acid (PLA) diblock copolymer (NuBCP-9/PLA-PEG) or PEGpolypropylene glycol-PEG-modiﬁed PLA—tetrablock copolymer (NuBCP-9/PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG). We found that
peptide encapsulation was enhanced by increasing the PEG chain length in the block copolymers. NuBCP-9
release from the nanoparticles was controlled by both PEG chain length and the PLA molecular weight, permitting
time-release over sustained periods. Treatment of human cancer cells with these nanoparticles in vitro triggered
apoptosis by NuBCP-9–mediated mechanism, with a potency similar to NuBCP-9 linked to a cell-penetrating
poly-Arg peptide. Strikingly, in vivo administration of NuBCP-9/nanoparticles triggered complete regressions in
the Ehrlich syngeneic mouse model of solid tumor. Our results illustrate an effective method for sustained delivery
of anticancer peptides, highlighting the superior qualities of the novel PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG tetrablock copolymer
formulation as a tool to target intracellular proteins. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3271–81. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
BCL-2 family proteins are important regulators of the mitochondrial outer membrane potential (MOMP) and thereby the
induction of apoptosis (1, 2). The BCL-2 family is divided into
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members that share BCL-2
homology (BH) domains. The proapoptotic BCL-2 family
members BAX and BAK contain multiple BH domains and
control the MOMP. Other proapoptotic members that possess
only the BH3 domain (BAD, BIM, BID, PUMA, and NOXA)
either directly activate BAX/BAK, or inhibit the antiapoptotic
activity of BCL-2 and BCL-xL to promote BAX/BAK activation.
The antiapoptotic activities of the BCL-2 and BCL-xL proteins
have been targeted with peptides derived from the BH3 domain
and with small molecule inhibitors, such as ABT-737 and

navitoclax, that mimic the BH3 a-helix (3–5). BCL-2 has also
been targeted with a Nur77-derived peptide of 9 amino acids
(NuBCP-9; ref. 6). Nur77 is an orphan nuclear receptor that
interacts with the BCL-2 N-terminal loop region and induces a
BCL-2 conformational change (7). Binding of Nur77 exposes
the BCL-2 BH3 domain and converts BCL-2 from an antiapoptotic protein to an inducer of apoptosis (7). Based on these
ﬁndings, the D-amino acid NuBCP-9 peptide corresponding to
the Nur77 region that interacts with BCL-2 was conjugated to
the cell-penetrating D-Arg octamer (r8). Signiﬁcantly, NuBCP9-r8 was shown to induce apoptosis of cancer, but not normal,
cells by a BCL-2–dependent mechanism (6). As predicted from
Nur77 studies, NuBCP-9 binding was associated with a BCL-2
conformational change and thereby neutralization of BCL-2–
mediated inhibition of BAX (6). NuBCP-9 binding to BCL-2 also
exposes the BCL-2 BH3 domain and inhibits the survival
function of BCL-xL (6). These ﬁndings and the demonstration
that NuBCP-9-r8 induces apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and
in animal models supported the development of NuBCP-9-r8 as
a selective anticancer agent.
Intracellular cancer targets that are devoid of an ATPbinding pocket are often undruggable with small chemical
inhibitors. Cell-penetrating therapeutic peptides have thus
emerged as promising agents because of their potential for
targeting intracellular proteins in cancer cells with high speciﬁcity and limited off-target toxicity (8, 9). However, delivery of
anticancer peptides presents a challenge as a result of the
potential degradation and immunogenicity of these agents. In

addition, small therapeutic peptides generally have short
circulating half-lives and require frequent administration for
sustained inhibition of their target proteins (10). Therapeutic
peptides also frequently require a protein transduction domain
(PTD) for cell membrane penetration and intracellular localization (11–13). Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) that have been
widely used for cargo delivery include, among others, the TAT
peptide, penetratin, and oligoarginines (11). The selection of a
certain CPP is of importance in that the CPP can in a cargodependent manner contribute to decreased serum stability,
inefﬁcient transit from the endosome to the cytosol, and
unanticipated toxicities (14). Indeed, for NuBCP-9, the cellpenetrating r8 used for intracellular delivery acts in synergy
with the N-terminal phenylalanine of NuBCP-9 to cause membrane blebbing and cell necrosis that are independent of BCL-2
expression (15). These ﬁndings have supported the study of
alternative CPPs for NuBCP-9 or other formulations that
preclude the use of a CPP for intracellular delivery.
Nanoparticle delivery systems for anticancer agents, particularly small molecules such as doxorubicin and paclitaxel, have
been developed to improve pharmacokinetic parameters and
therapeutic index (16). In this context, tumor microenvironments that are subject to hypoxia and acidosis can limit the
effectiveness of small molecule anticancer agents (16). By
extension and through what is referred to as the enhanced
permeation retention (EPR) effect, nanoparticle delivery of
anticancer agents can overcome limitations imposed by the
tumor microenvironment and sustain drug exposure (16, 17).
Nanoparticles can also be decorated with ligands to selectively
target the surface of tumor cells (18). Polymeric nanoparticles
represent one class that has been widely studied and shown to
be nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable (19, 20). Speciﬁcally, PLA-PEG block copolymer nanoparticles have been
used as carriers for anticancer drugs in sustained/controlled
release and targeted delivery systems to enhance efﬁcacy and
circumvent drug resistance (19, 20). For example, Genexol-PM
is a paclitaxel-loaded PLA-PEG polymeric nanoparticle that is
approved for use in Korea and is undergoing phase II evaluation in the United States for metastatic cancers (19, 21). BIND
Biosciences also has under development docetaxel-encapsulated PLA-PEG nanoparticles for the treatment of solid tumors
(19). Curiously, polymeric nanoparticles have not been fully
evaluated for the delivery of anticancer peptide drugs.
The present studies have focused on the encapsulation of
NuBCP-9 into PLA-PEG nanoparticles or a novel PLA-PEGPPG-PEG tetrablock nanoparticle system to assess delivery of
this anticancer peptide to malignant cells in vitro and in vivo.
The results obtained provide the experimental basis for the
further development of NuBCP-9/nanoparticles and for the
potential delivery of other anticancer peptide drugs.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis and characterization of PLA-PEG copolymers
PLA-PEG diblock copolymers were synthesized using 72kDa PLA (NatureWorks) or 12-kDa PLA (Purac Chemicals).
PEG was used at 1, 2, or 4 kDa (CDH, India) for coupling to PLA.
PEG-PPG-PEG (12.5 kDa; Poloxamer-F127, Sigma-Aldrich) was
also used for the synthesis of PLA block copolymers. In a

3272

standard experiment, 0.014 mmol PLA and PEG or PEG-PPGPEG were dissolved in 100 mL dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and
stirred at 0 C to 2 C. To these solutions, 5 mL of 1% N,Ndicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC) was added slowly, followed by
the addition of 2 mL of 0.1% 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)
and stirring for 16 hours. The resulting PLA-PEG and PLA-PEGPPG-PEG block copolymers were precipitated with a 1:1 mixture of diethyl ether and methanol to remove unreacted PEG
and PEG-PPG-PEG. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
analysis was performed at room temperature using a Viscoteck
GPC system with tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase. The
synthesized PLA block copolymers were dried under vacuum
and stored at 20 C until use. 1HNMR of PLA-PEG or PLAPEG-PPG-PEG was performed in CDCl3 at 300 Hz (Bruker).
Preparation of rhodamine B- and NuBCP-9–loaded
nanoparticles
Loading of the PLA-PEG and PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles was performed using a double emulsion solvent evaporation
method. PLA-PEG or PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG copolymers (100 mg)
were dissolved in 5 mL acetonitrile. Rhodamine B (1 mg) or Lamino acid NuBCP-9 (10 mg; Bioconcept, India) was added to
the solution with brief sonication. The resulting primary emulsion was then added dropwise into a 20 mL aqueous phase
composed of Poloxamer-F127 (PEG-PPG-PEG) in distilled water
and stirred at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours to facilitate
solvent evaporation and nanoparticle stabilization. Nanoparticles were loaded with NuBCP-9 (FSRSLHSLL) peptide (7) and
ﬁltered through an Amikon 10-kDa ultraﬁlter (Millipore). The
nanoparticles were lyophilized and stored at 20 C until use.
The ﬁltrate was collected and analyzed for free NuBCP-9 peptide
using a Micro-BCA Kit (Pierce Chemicals). Encapsulation efﬁciency of NuBCP-9 peptide was determined using the following

Assessment of NuBCP-9 release from nanoparticles
The in vitro release kinetics of NuBCP-9 from nanoparticles
were determined by the ultraﬁltration method. Brieﬂy, samples
of freeze-dried nanoparticles (10 mg) were suspended in PBS
and incubated at 37 C with gentle shaking at 150 to 160 rpm. At
predetermined time points of up to 60 days, the samples were
removed from the incubator and ultraﬁltered through 10-kDa
Amikon ﬁlters (Millipore). The ﬁltrates were collected for
analysis and fresh buffer was added to the respective tubes.
Peptide concentration in the ﬁltrates was determined by
micro-BCA assay.

Preparation and characterization of NuBCP-9–loaded
polymeric nanoparticles
PLA-PEG nanoparticles have been commonly synthesized
using PLA of 20 kDa or less (19–21). In this work, we studied
the development of polymeric nanoparticles that incorporate
PLA of 72 kDa to regulate the release of peptide drugs. PLAPEG and PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG block copolymers were synthesized by the DCC/DMAP conjugation method. As determined by
GPC, the molecular weight of PLA was 72,487 Da and it increased
directly upon conjugation with increasing block length of PEG
(1, 2, or 4 kDa) or with PEG-PPG-PEG (Table 1). 1HNMR of

Analysis of antitumor activity
Mouse Ehrlich tumor cells were injected subcutaneously
in the hind limb of syngeneic Balb/c mice (17–22 g). Micebearing tumors (400 mm3) were divided into 9 groups
(10 mice/group) and treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intratumorally (i.t.) with different agents using two schedules for 21
days (Supplementary Table S1). Tumor volume was determined by calipers and calculated using the formula (A  B2)
 0.5, where A and B are the longest and shortest tumor
diameters, respectively. From each group, 1 mouse was sacriﬁced on day 7, 14, and 21 for harvesting of tumor for histopathologic examination. Statistical analysis of tumor volumes
was performed by one-way ANOVA and the Dunnett test using
Origin 8.0 (Origin Lab). Survival of the mice was determined by
the Kaplan–Meier method using Prism 4.0 software (Graph
Pad Software). One mouse from each of the control and NuBCP9/nanoparticle-treated (i.p. once/week) groups was sacriﬁced
on day 14 for tumor excision. The tumors were ﬁxed in 10%
formalin/saline and embedded in parafﬁn. Five-micrometer
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

PLA72K-PEG showed peaks at 5.2 ppm [OCH(CH3)C(O)n-O(CH2CH2O)m], 3.7 ppm [OCH(CH3)C(O)n-O-(CH2CH2O)m], and
1.6 ppm [OCH(CH3)C(O)n-O-(CH2CH2O)m]. An additional peak
at 2.1 ppm was observed for PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG because of
the –OCH3 proton of PPG. These results conﬁrmed coupling of
PLA72K with PEG or PEG-PPG-PEG.
The PLA-PEG block copolymer consists of a bilayer structure with the PLA hydrophobic core and the PEG hydrophilic
shell interfacing with the aqueous medium. By contrast, conjugation of PEG-PPG-PEG with PLA results in multilayered
nanoparticles as a result of PPG extending the hydrophobic
structure (22). SEM studies of both the PLA72K-PEG4K and
PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles showed that the particles
are spherical with uniform sizes ranging from 40 to 50 nm in
diameter (Fig. 1A, left and right). The nanoparticles were then
loaded with rhodamine B to assess their uptake in cells.
Incubation of the rhodamine B/PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles
with MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated uptake over 3 to
12 hours (Fig. 1B). The results further showed intracellular
ﬂuorescence of the rhodamine B-nanoparticles diffusely
throughout the cytosol (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained
with the rhodamine B/PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles
(data not shown). Uptake of PLA-based nanoparticles is
through endocytosis and is associated with surface charge
reversal (anionic to cationic) in the acidic pH of the endolysosomes. This charge reversal facilitates interaction of the
nanoparticles with vesicular membranes, leading to transient
and localized membrane destabilization, and thereby escape of
the nanoparticles into the cytosol (23). Alternatively, rhodamine B may have been released from the nanoparticles.
However, extensive washing of the nanoparticles after rhodamine B loading and the short 12-hour duration of the experiment support a mechanism other than release.
Our results further demonstrate that the hydrophilic PEG
segment of the block copolymers facilitated the encapsulation
of the L-amino acid NuBCP-9 peptide into the core of the
PLA72K-PEG and PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles. For

example, when the feeding ratio of NuBCP-9/block copolymers
(w/w) was 1:10, the encapsulation efﬁciency of the different
polymeric nanoparticles ranged from 43% to 66% (Table 1). The
encapsulation efﬁciency of NuBCP-9 in PLA72K-PEG nanoparticles was higher than that obtained with PLA72K nanoparticles
(Table 1). In concert with those ﬁndings, increases in PEG
chain length resulted in improved encapsulation of the hydrophilic NuBCP-9 peptide (Table 1) and maximum encapsulation
was obtained with PLA72K-PEG4K. Moreover, the encapsulation
efﬁciency of the PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles (64%)
was similar to that obtained with the PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles (66%; Table 1). Final loading of NuBCP-9 into these PLAbased nanoparticles was approximately 0.065 mg peptide/mg
polymer and this concentration was used throughout the
following in vitro and in vivo studies.
Nanoparticle tracking analysis measurements of the
nanoparticles documented a hydrodynamic diameter ranging from 114 to 125 nm, which did not change signiﬁcantly
after NuBCP-9 loading (Table 1). In addition, the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was not signiﬁcantly
altered by coupling to the different PEG molecular weights
(1, 2, and 4 kDa), consistent with the greater mass of PLA as
compared with PEG (Table 1). By contrast, the z potential of
the nanoparticles increased with increasing PEG block
length (Table 1), a ﬁnding in concert with the demonstration
that the z potential of nanoparticles approaches neutral with
increases in hydrophilicity because of PEG coupling (24).
Notably, the z potential of the PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles
was similar to that for PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles
before and after NuBCP-9 loading (Table 1). We also found
that NuBCP-9 loading is associated with a marked decrease
in z potential as compared with that obtained with the
unloaded nanoparticles (Table 1). The precise reason for
this decrease in z potential is not clear; however, it is
plausible that because of the interaction of the positively
charged adsorbed peptide with the negatively charged PLA,
the peptide carboxyl groups, which have a negative charge,

are exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles. Studies have
shown that negatively charged nanoparticles are taken up
less efﬁciently by cells in vitro as compared with positively
charged nanoparticles (25). However, negatively charged
nanoparticles are not cleared as rapidly from the circulation
as positively charges nanoparticles (25). Thus, the decrease
in z potential of the NuBCP-9–loaded nanoparticles could
affect their behavior in vitro and in vivo.
Release of NuBCP-9 from nanoparticles in vitro
The release proﬁles (percent cumulative release and percent
release/day) of NuBCP-9 from the nanoparticles was assessed
at pH 7.4 for up to 60 days (Fig. 2A–D and Supplementary Fig.
S1A–S1D). PLA72K and PLA72K-PEG nanoparticles with PEG
chain lengths of 1, 2, and 4 kDa exhibited cumulative releases of
62%, 78%, 85%, and 92%, respectively (Fig. 2A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Maximum NuBCP-9 release
at pH 7.4 was thus observed with the PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles, consistent with an increase in ﬂexibility and hydrophilicity, and thereby hydration of the nanoparticles with
increases in PEG chain length. At pH 5.0, the initial release
of NuBCP-9 from PLA72K-PEG nanoparticles was similar to that
found at pH 7.4 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). However,
NuBCP-9 release at pH 5.0 was slower after day 7 and was only
68% as compared with 92% at pH 7.4 (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2B). At pH 5.0, PLA chains remain in a coiled state and are
thereby less susceptible to hydrolytic degradation (26, 27). By
contrast, at pH 7.4, the PLA chains uncoil because of ionization,
which is associated with an increase in nanoparticle degradation and release of NuBCP-9. The slower release at pH 5.0 could
be a favorable characteristic in that there would be less NuBCP9 release in the lysosome, a compartment with acidic pH, and

thereby less degradation of the peptide. In addition, as compared with PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles, release of NuBCP-9
from PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles was slower at pH 7.4
(Fig. 2A–D), which is likely because of the hydrophobic nature
of the PPG in the PEG-PPG-PEG block. In this regard, the recent
synthesis of PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG copolymers by ring-opening
polymerization of L-lactide has demonstrated that the hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance is not sufﬁcient for the formation
of bilayer vesicles and that the assembly of an onion-like vesicle
is responsible for sustained insulin release (22).
Lower molecular weight PLA (12 kDa) was also used to
synthesize PLA-PEG block copolymers to assess the effect on
NuBCP-9 loading and release. The encapsulation efﬁciency of
NuBCP-9 into PLA12K-PEG-PPG-PEG was similar to that
obtained with PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG (Table 1). However,
release of NuBCP-9 from PLA12K-PEG-PPG-PEG was sustained
for only 10 days as compared with 60 days for PLA72K-PEGPPG-PEG. After 10 days, peptide was no longer detectable in
the ﬁltrate, a ﬁnding probably due in part to the degradation
and bio-solubilization of low molecular weight PLA, which
interferes with peptide detection in the assays (Fig. 2A–D).
Based on these results, the NuBCP-9–encapsulated PLA72K
-PEG4K and PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles were further
studied for biologic activity in vitro and in vivo.
Effects of NuBCP-9–encapsulated nanoparticles on
cancer cell growth and survival in vitro
To assess activity of the NuBCP-9–loaded nanoparticles, we
studied their effects on growth of BCL-2–expressing MCF-7
(28) and HepG2 (29) cells and, as a control, primary HUVEC
cells. Notably, NuBCP-9 is ineffective in inhibiting cancer cell
proliferation in the absence of a CPP, such as r8 (6), and these

observations were conﬁrmed when NuBCP-9 was tested
against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A and B). However, as
expected from previous studies (6), the L-amino acid NuBCP-9R8 (R denotes L-amino acid; r denotes D-amino) completely
blocked growth of these cells after treatment at 15 mmol/L for
48 hours (Fig. 3A and B), conﬁrming that R8 is necessary for cell
penetration and BCL-2 targeting. Notably, the NuBCP-9 that
has been encapsulated in nanoparticles in this studies is devoid
of R8 and therefore would be expected to be inactive unless
effectively delivered by the nanoparticles. Indeed, the NuBCP9–encapsulated nanoparticles were highly effective in inhibit-

ing growth of MCF-7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A and B). By
contrast, empty nanoparticles not encapsulated with NuBCP-9
had little if any effect on growth (data not shown). Other
studies were performed to assess the effects of using different
concentrations of NuBCP-9 nanoparticles on cell viability. As
expected, NuBCP-9-R8 induced death of MCF-7 cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). In addition, the
NuBCP-9 nanoparticles (PLA72K-PEG4K and PLA72K-PEG-PPGPEG) were effective in killing MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C). Similar
results were obtained when HepG2 cells were treated with
different concentrations of PLA-PEG nanoparticles (Fig. 3D).

The IC50 values for the NuBCP-9 nanoparticles ranged from 1.9
to 4.2 mmol/L, as compared with 7.1 to 9.1 mmol/L for NuBCP-9
R8 (Table 2). In addition and in concert with the lack of NuBCP9 activity against normal cells (6), NuBCP-9–encapsulated
nanoparticles had no apparent effect on HUVEC cell growth
(Fig. 3E). These results indicate that NuBCP-9 can be delivered
intracellularly in an active form by polymeric nanoparticles.
NuBCP-9/nanoparticles induce apoptosis of cancer cells
NuBCP-9-r8 is a selective inducer of cancer cell apoptosis by
targeting Bcl-2 (6). To assess the effects of NuBCP-9 nanoparticles on the apoptotic response, MCF-7 cells were treated with
NuBCP-9/PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles and monitored for
externalization of phosphatidylserine at the cell membrane.
Confocal images of MCF-7 cells stained with Annexin V-Alexa
ﬂour 488/PI demonstrated that treatment with NuBCP-9
nanoparticles is associated with the induction of an apoptotic
response (Fig. 4A). By contrast, treatment with empty nanoparticles had no apparent effect (Fig. 4A). Quantitation of
Annexin V and PI staining by Cellometer Vision conﬁrmed
that NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles and NuBCP-9
PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles are as effective as
NuBCP-9-R8 in inducing apoptosis of MCF-7 cells at 48 hours
(Fig. 4B). As controls, empty PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles and
NuBCP-9 devoid of R8 had little, if any effect on MCF-7 cell
apoptosis (Fig. 4B). As reported (28, 29), immunoblot analysis
of MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lysates conﬁrmed the expression of
BCL-2 (Fig. 4C). Moreover and in concert with the effects of
NuBCP-9 on BCL-2 (6), treatment of MCF-7 and HepG2 cells
with NuBCP-9 nanoparticles was associated with activation of
caspase-3 (Fig. 4D). These ﬁndings thus demonstrate that, like
NuBCP-9-R8, encapsulation of NuBCP-9 in nanoparticles
results in the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4D).
NuBCP-9 nanoparticles are effective in inducing
complete tumor regressions
To assess the antitumor effects of NuBCP-9 nanoparticles in
vivo, we treated Balb/c mice bearing established (400 mm3)
subcutaneous BCL-2–positive Ehrlich syngeneic tumors (30).
In this widely used model to assess the effects of anticancer
agents, accurate administration of the viscous suspensions of

www.aacrjournals.org

nanoparticles was problematic in the narrow tail vein. As such,
we used the i.p. route of administration, which allows nanoparticles to enter the systemic circulation through mesenteric
vessels and the portal vein (31). Moreover, these studies were
performed with NuBCP-9 (devoid of R8) because (i) NuBCP-9R8 is active in vivo when administered i.t. (6), and (ii) the
NuBCP-9 should be inactive in the absence of a CPP. Intraperitoneal injection of NuBCP-9 on a twice weekly schedule
for 21 days had no signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth as compared with that obtained with the saline control (PBS; Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Table S1). Signiﬁcantly, i.p. treatment with
NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles at a dose of 20 mg/kg
(NuBCP-9 peptide dose) on the same schedule was associated
with complete and prolonged tumor regressions (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, in contrast to the empty PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles, i.p. injection of NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG4K nanoparticles
on a weekly schedule for 21 days resulted in similar antitumor responses (Fig. 5B). For assessment of direct delivery of
NuBCP-9 nanoparticles into the tumors, we also administered
NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles i.t. on a twice
weekly schedule for 21 days and compared the effects of
intraperitoneal administration of PLA72K-PEG-PPG-PEG on
tumor growth. The results demonstrate that regression of the
tumors was similar when the NuBCP-9 nanoparticles were
delivered i.t. as compared with i.p. (Fig. 5C). However, i.p.
treatment was more effective than i.t. in maintaining these
antitumor responses after completing treatment (Fig. 5C).
Similar results were obtained when NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG4K
nanoparticles were administered i.t. weekly or twice weekly
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Analysis of survival as determined by
Kaplan–Meier plots further demonstrated that mice treated
with NuBCP-9 nanoparticles (PLA72K-PEG4K or PLA72K-PEGPPG-PEG) weekly or twice weekly survived signiﬁcantly longer
than the saline, empty nanoparticles, or NuBCP-9 controls (Fig.
5D and E). Moreover, the NuBCP-9 nanoparticles–treated mice
survived longer when administration was i.p. as compared with
the i.t. route (Fig. 5D and E). Signiﬁcantly, there was no weight
loss or other overt toxicities observed in the NuBCP-9/nanoparticle-treated mice (data not shown). Analysis of tissue
sections demonstrated that tumor cells from the control mice
exhibited mitosis and little, if any, evidence of necrosis (Fig. 5F,
left). By contrast, tumor cells from NuBCP-9 PLA72K-PEG4K
nanoparticles-treated mice had decreased mitotic activity and
considerably larger regions of necrosis (Fig. 5F, right), consistent with the antitumor activity of NuBCP-9.

Discussion
Peptide drugs have considerable potential for targeting
intracellular oncoproteins that lack hydrophobic pockets and
are thereby not eminently druggable with small molecules (32).
In this context, there are increasing reports of peptide drugs
under development that target nonkinase proteins such as
survivin (33), HDM2 (34), NOTCH (35), MUC1 (36), and b-catenin (37), among others. The BCL-2 family proteins have also
been the focus of peptide inhibitor development, speciﬁcally in
one strategy using stabilized a-helices of BCL-2 domains
(SAHB; ref. 38). BCL-2 has also been converted from an antiapoptotic protein to an inducer of cell death by the Nur77-

also effective in inducing apoptosis in vivo when injected
directly into tumors (6). Indeed, a challenge for the development of many peptide drugs, like NuBCP-9, is the potential for
systemic delivery, which can be limited by pharmacologic
parameters, such as short circulating half-lives, that prevent
prolonged drug exposure. For example, systemic delivery of
MUC1-targeted peptides has necessitated frequent daily dosing for effective antitumor activity in xenograft tumor models
(36). The present studies, using NuBCP-9 as a model, were
therefore performed to assess the delivery and release of an
anticancer peptide drug in nanoparticles.
Nanoparticles are being widely used for the effective delivery
of small molecules (19–21). However, the collective experience
with encapsulation of peptides into nanoparticles is limited. A
polycationic peptide targeting BCL-2 has been incorporated
into cationic liposomes as a potential anticancer agent (39, 40).
In addition, the membrane-disrupting cytolytic peptide, melittin, has been incorporated into the outer lipid monolayer of a
perﬂuorocarbon nanoemulsion vehicle to target tumors (41).
Other cytoxic peptides have been developed in cyclodextrin
polymerized nanoparticles, glycolide nanoparticles, and poly
(propylacrylic acid) nanoparticles (42, 43). To our knowledge,
none of these peptide nanoformulations have been further
developed for clinical evaluation. In this context, a signiﬁcant
consideration for the clinical development of nanoparticles is
the concentration of emulsiﬁer, which at high levels can be

www.aacrjournals.org

toxic to kidneys. In this study, the PLA-PEG and PLA-PEG-PPGPEG nanoparticles were prepared using a double emulsion
solvent evaporation method (44). Our results show that an
advantage of using PEG-PPG-PEG as a block copolymer in
preparation of PLA nanoparticles is that emulsiﬁer concentrations can be markedly reduced for PLA nanoparticle stabilization at pH 7.4. Indeed, for PLA-PEG nanoparticles, the ﬁnal
emulsiﬁer concentration was 0.4%, however, we were able to
further reduce that concentration by 5-fold to 0.08% for the
PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles. These ﬁndings are therefore of potential signiﬁcance for the clinical development of
these polymeric nanoparticles.
Based on the results obtained with our double emulsion
method, we studied loading of NuBCP-9 in the PLA-PEG and
PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles. Previous work had demonstrated that increasing PEG chain length from 1 to 4 kDa
signiﬁcantly improves the hydrophilicity and ﬂexibility of block
copolymers (44). Consequently, we analyzed the effects of
different lengths of the PEG block and found that increases
in PEG chain length improves NuBCP-9 loading. Moreover, our
results demonstrate that release of NuBCP-9 over time is
enhanced by increases in PEG chain length, a ﬁnding in concert
with greater ﬂexibility, hydrophilicity and hydration of the
nanoparticle. In turn, the rate of diffusion increases, as does
release of the peptide from the nanoparticle matrix (20, 45–48).
Thus, for NuBCP-9 and potentially other peptide drugs, these

ﬁndings indicate that PEG chain length is of importance for
both loading in and release from polymeric nanoparticles.
Another aspect of our studies worth highlighting is the use
of a high molecular weight PLA (72 kDa) in the NuBCP-9
encapsulated nanoparticles. Previous work on polymeric nanoparticles has generally involved lower molecular weight PLA,
for example, using 20 kDa or less (49, 50). Our results indicate
that in vitro release of NuBCP-9 from our nanoparticles was
sustained to more than 60 days when using 72-kDa PLA as
compared with release of the peptide more than 10 days with
12-kDa PLA. These results can be explained, at least in part,
by the hydrolysis of PLA and thereby NuBCP-9 diffusion. At pH
5.0, PLA remains coiled and is less susceptible to hydrolysis;
whereas at pH 7.4, the PLA chains open with an increased
propensity for hydrolysis. The uncoiling of PLA is thus associated with an increase in its degradation and release of
NuBCP-9 (26, 27). These ﬁndings collectively indicate that
peptide release from polymeric nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the sizes of the PEG and PLA blocks.
NuBCP-9 is a highly promising anticancer peptide that
selectively induces apoptosis of cancer cells by exposing the
BCL-2 BH3 domain and blocking the BCL-xL survival function
(6). NuBCP-9 was linked to the D-Arg octamer r8 for intracellular delivery, a modiﬁcation that has been reported to
decrease selectivity by inducing BCL-2–independent cell killing involving membrane disruption (15). In this work, delivery
of NuBCP-9 into cancer cells by the polymeric nanoparticles
was achieved without the need for the R8 PTD. In addition, the
NuBCP-9–encapsulated nanoparticles were by comparison
more potent in inducing apoptosis than NuBCP-9-R8. The
NuBCP-9/nanoparticles also maintained the reported selectivity of NuBCP-9 for cancer cells as evidenced by their absence
of HUVEC killing (6). Previous studies of the antitumor effects
of NuBCP-9 in vivo were performed by direct injection of
NuBCP-9-r8 into MDA-MB-435 breast cancer xenografts growing in SCID mice (6). Under these experimental conditions,
NuBCP-9-r8 treatment was associated with partial MDA-MB435 tumor regressions (6). In this studies using the subcutaneous Ehrlich tumor model in syngeneic mice, we compared
the effectiveness of NuBCP-9/nanoparticles administered i.p.
and i.t.. Signiﬁcantly, both routes of NuBCP-9/nanoparticle
administration were effective in inducing complete regressions
of the Ehrlich tumors. Moreover and interestingly, i.p. admin-

istration was more effective than i.t. delivery in maintaining
prolonged tumor regressions. The basis for this distinction is
presently not clear, but is likely related to pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of the NuBCP-9/nanoparticles, which
will be the focus of subsequent studies. Of further importance,
administration of the NuBCP-9/nanoparticles was well tolerated with no evidence of weight loss or overt toxicities. These
results thus provide support for the effective delivery of Lamino acid NuBCP-9 by PLA-PEG-PPG-PEG nanoparticles and
may be applicable to other anticancer peptides. In summary,
our ﬁndings describe a novel nanoparticle-based approach for
delivery of L-amino acid peptides without a cell-penetrating
domain that (i) requires reduced levels of emulsiﬁer, (ii)
incorporates higher molecular weights of PLA for sustained
and prolonged peptide release, (iii) induces effective anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, and (iv) requires less frequent
dosing (once/week) compared with the daily injections that
were necessary for partial antitumor activity of the D-amino
acid NuBCP-9-r8 peptide in vivo (6).
