BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors evaluated long-term outcomes, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)-related toxicity,
and prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) among patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) who
received IORT as part of their treatment at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for
194 consecutive patients with unresectable LAPC who were treated with IORT at MGH between 1978 and 2010. OS was calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated at the univariate level by the log-rank test and at the multivariate
level by the Cox proportional hazards model. Rates of disease progression and treatment toxicity were calculated. RESULTS: The 1year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 49%, 16%, and 6%, respectively. Six patients (3%) survived for > 5 years. The median OS
was 12.0 months. Among 183 patients with known post-IORT disease status, the 2-year local progression-free survival and distant
metastasis-free survival rates were 41% and 28%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, an IORT applicator diameter  8 cm (hazards
ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.30-0.84 [P 5.009]), a Charlson age-comorbidity index  3 (HR, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.31-0.73 [P 5.001]), and receipt of chemotherapy (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33-0.66 [P <.001]) predicted improved OS. The median OS for
patients with all 3 positive prognostic factors was 21.2 months. CONCLUSIONS: Well-selected patients with LAPC with small tumors
and low Charlson age-comorbidity indices can achieve good long-term survival outcomes with a treatment regimen that incorporates

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, curable only by surgical
resection.1 Approximately 30% of patients present with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), defined as nonmetastatic
localized cancer that is unresectable due to vascular invasion or occlusion.2 Although current National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines recommend 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy as first-line
treatment for patients with LAPC, to the best of our knowledge the role of localized radiotherapy remains controversial.3
Since 1978, patients with LAPC with good performance status have been considered for consolidative intraoperative
radiotherapy (IORT) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).4 The goal of IORT is to improve local control by
delivering high-dose radiation to the pancreatic bed with the surrounding normal tissue retracted and shielded. In 2005,
Willett et al reported that among the first 150 patients with LAPC to receive IORT at MGH as part of their treatment,
the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 54%, 15%, and 7%, respectively. It is worth noting that 5
patients survived past 5 years, and an increased IORT applicator diameter (a tumor diameter surrogate) was found to be
predictive of decreased OS.5

IORT Outcomes and Prognostics in LAPC/Cai et al

The objective of the current study was to update our
published experience of long-term outcomes to include
194 consecutive patients with LAPC who received IORT
between 1978 and 2010. We also sought prognostic factors to aid in the selection of those patients most likely to
achieve long-term survival with IORT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

The MGH Institutional Review Board approved the current study. We identified 194 consecutive patients with
unresectable, nonmetastatic, histologically confirmed
pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received IORT at MGH
between August 1978 and April 2010. Patient charts were
retrospectively reviewed to collect data regarding baseline
demographics, tumor characteristics, pretreatment
comorbidities, treatment regimens, disease progression,
and IORT-related toxicities. Performance status, serum
tumor marker values, and tumor stage were omitted from
this analysis due to inconsistent reporting.
Initial Treatment
External-Beam Radiotherapy

The median external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) dose
was 49.6 grays (Gy) (range, 0 Gy-59.4 Gy). A total of 188
patients (97%) received pre-IORT EBRT. Before 1990,
68 of 83 patients (82%) received low-dose pre-IORT
EBRT (at a dose of 10 Gy-20 Gy) with additional postIORT EBRT (with or without concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy) to a total EBRT dose of up to
50.4 Gy. Since 1990, the majority of patients have
received high-dose pre-IORT EBRT up to 50.4 Gy
without post-IORT EBRT.
Since 1988, most patients receiving pre-IORT
EBRT have received concurrent radiosensitizing continuous infusion (225 mg=m2 per 24 hours) or bolus injection
(500 mg=m2 for 3 consecutive days during the first and
last weeks of EBRT) chemotherapy with 5-FU. Eleven
patients received both continuous infusion 5-FU and
weekly doses of 200 mg=m2 of radiosensitizing gemcitabine on protocol.

delivered radiation of a given dose (median, 20 Gy; range,
10 Gy-25 Gy) and energy (selected based on tumor depth;
median, 15 megaelectron volts [MeV]; range, 6 MeV-29
MeV) to the tumor and regional lymph nodes. Accompanying procedures were often performed before surgical
closure: gastrojejunostomy or gastroenterostomy (147
patients; 76%); hepaticojejunostomy (19 patients; 10%);
cholecystectomy (38 patients; 20%); and=or choledochojejunostomy, choledochoduodenostomy, or cholecystojejunostomy (28 patients; 14%).
Chemotherapy

Among 166 patients (86%) with documented chemotherapy status (independent of radiosensitizing chemotherapy
given concurrently with EBRT), 57 patients (34%)
received pre-IORT induction and=or post-IORT maintenance chemotherapy, typically 5-FU and leucovorin (5FU at a dose of 500 mg=m2 and leucovorin at a dose of
500 mg=m2 for 3 of every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine (at a
dose of 1000 mg=m2 for 3 of every 4 weeks). Since 2006,
induction gemcitabine chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and IORT has replaced earlier post-IORT
maintenance chemotherapy regimens.
Follow-Up

Patients were seen 6 to 8 weeks after the completion of all
radiotherapy and then at 3-month to 6-month intervals.
Follow-up included physical examination, serum tumor
marker assessment, chest and abdominopelvic computed
tomography imaging, and other procedures as indicated.
At the occurrence of disease progression, patients received
further chemotherapy or best supportive care.
IORT Toxicity

Early radiation-related side effects were graded in accordance with version 4.0 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Late
radiation-related side effects were graded in accordance
with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group=European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late
Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema.
Statistical Analysis

Intraoperative Radiotherapy

The IORT technique at MGH has been previously
described.5 A cylindrical metal applicator with a circular
(189 patients; 97%) or elliptical cross-section was used to
enclose the primary pancreatic tumor, leaving roughly 1
cm on either side of the tumor’s longest dimension
(median applicator diameter, 7 cm; range, 4 cm-12 cm).
After retraction of surrounding organs, a linear accelerator

Our primary endpoint was OS. Dates of death from any
cause were obtained from medical records and the Social
Security Death Index. Secondary endpoints were local
progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival,
and disease-free survival, typically determined by imaging
or biopsy. Local disease progression was defined as an
increase in the primary tumor size and=or regional lymph
nodes. Disease-free survival was defined as survival until

Times were measured relative to treatment initiation dates
and censored at dates of last follow-up when applicable.
Actuarial OS estimates and 95% pointwise confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors for OS were
evaluated at the univariate level by the log-rank test and at
the multivariate level by Cox proportional hazards analysis. The pretreatment Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)
and Charlson age-comorbidity index (CACI) were calculated from patient age and pretreatment comorbidities,
excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers and in situ cervical
carcinoma.6,7 All tests were 2-sided and performed using
SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC). A P value  .05 defined statistical
significance.
RESULTS
Patient, Tumor, and Treatment Characteristics

The median age of the patients was 63.6 years (range, 36
years-80 years). 103 patients (53%) were male and 150
patients (77%) had tumors localized to the head of the
pancreas (Table 1). Among 99 patients with documented
tumor histological grade (51%), 41 (41%) had welldifferentiated or moderately differentiated tumors. The
pretreatment median CCI and CACI were 0 (range, 0-3)
and 2 (range, 0-6), respectively. Table 2 summarizes

OS and Disease Progression

Over a median follow-up period of 11.6 months (range,
1.0 months-126.4 months), actuarial 1-year, 2-year, and 3year OS rates were 49% (95% CI, 41%-55%), 16% (95%
CI, 11%-21%), and 6% (95% CI, 3%-10%), respectively
(Table 3). Six patients lived past 5 years: 4 patients died of
their disease at a median of 7.4 years, 1 patient died of other
causes, and 1 patient was alive at the time of last follow-up.
A total of 187 patients (96%) had died at the time of last
follow-up. The median OS was 12.0 months (95% CI,
10.9 months-13.0 months) (Fig. 1).
Among 183 patients (94%) for whom there was
available post-IORT disease status follow-up documentation, 130 (71%) had documented disease progression
at the time of last follow-up, with 67 patients (37%)

chemotherapy (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.34-0.68 [P < .001])
were found to be predictive of improved OS (Fig. 2). An
IORT applicator diameter  8 cm (HR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.38-1.02 [P 5 .057]) trended toward predicting
improved OS (Fig. 2). Although age-unadjusted CCI  1
also trended toward predicting improved OS (HR, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.45-1.02 [P 5 .058]), only CACI was included
in subsequent multivariate analysis. Age, treatment year,
presence of diabetes, tumor location, tumor grade, IORT
dose, and total IORT plus EBRT dose were not found to
be associated with OS.
On multivariate analysis, a CACI  3 (HR, 0.47;
95% CI, 0.31-0.73 [P 5 .001]), an IORT applicator diameter  8 cm (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.84
[P 5 .009]), and receipt of chemotherapy (HR, 0.46;
95% CI, 0.33-0.66 [P < .001]) were found to be independently predictive of improved OS (Table 5). Among
the 40 patients with all 3 positive prognostic factors
(21%), the median OS was 21.2 months (95% CI, 16.1
months-25.7 months), with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS
rates of 78% (95% CI, 61%-88%), 43% (95% CI, 27%57%), and 20% (95% CI, 9%-33%), respectively and a
2-year local progression-free survival rate of 55% (95%
CI, 34%-71%).

and=or post-IORT maintenance chemotherapy, independent of radiosensitizing chemotherapy given concurrently with EBRT.3 The median OS in this smaller cohort
was 17.6 months (95% CI, 13.0 months-22.1 months).
Actuarial 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were
71% (95% CI, 57%-81%), 33% (95% CI, 21%-46%),
and 15% (95% CI, 7%-26%), respectively. On univariate
analysis, a CACI  3 (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10-0.54
[P 5 .0002]) was predictive of improved OS (Fig. 3),
whereas an IORT applicator diameter  8 cm (HR, 0.46;
95% CI, 0.20-1.05 [P 5 .058]) trended toward predicting improved OS. On multivariate analysis, only a CACI
 3 (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.61 [P 5 .002]) was found
to be predictive of improved OS, with a median OS of
20.8 months (95% CI, 16.0 months-24.7 months) noted
for patients with a CACI  3 (Table 6).
IORT Toxicity

Table 7 summarizes IORT-related toxicities. The acute
postoperative grade 3 complication rate was 21% (41
patients), with the most frequent complication being
delayed gastric emptying (12 patients; 6%). All but 3 of
the patients with gastric emptying had undergone a gastrojejunostomy at the time of IORT. The late complication rate was 14% (27 patients), with the most frequent
complication being gastrointestinal bleeding (23 patients;
12%). None of the 3 acute or late postoperative radiationrelated deaths were reported among patients who were
treated within the last decade.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we updated and expanded our institution’s published experience of long-term outcomes
among patients with unresectable LAPC who were treated
with IORT.5 To the best of our knowledge, our cohort of
194 patients is the largest to date in the IORT literature
for patients with LAPC. Comparable to our institution’s
previously published values, we reported 1-year, 2-year, 3year, and 5-year OS rates of 49%, 16%, 6%, and 3%,
respectively.8,9 In addition, we have shown that patients
with LAPC who receive chemotherapy, have small
tumors, and have low pretreatment CACI scores can

21.2 months and a 3-year OS rate of 20% reported in the
current study cohort.
Our OS and local control rates are comparable to
those of 2 other large retrospective studies of patients with
LAPC who were treated with IORT. In a 2011 multiinstitution analysis of 144 patients with LAPC treated with
IORT with or without EBRT and=or chemotherapy,
Ogawa et al reported a median OS of 10.5 months, a 2year OS rate of 15%, and a 2-year local control rate of

pancreatic cancer.3 Meanwhile, the role of localized radiotherapy has received increasing attention since the results
of the 2009 autopsy analysis by Iacobuzio-Donahue et al
demonstrated that local tumor progression causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with unresectable
and even frankly metastatic pancreatic cancer.10 It is interesting to note that the median OS of 17.6 months noted
among the patients in the current study who received
both IORT and chemotherapy exceeds the 13-month median OS reported by Chauffert et al in their 2008 phase 3
trial demonstrating improved OS among patients with
LAPC who are treated with gemcitabine alone versus
more aggressive chemoradiation.11 Since 2006, MGH has
increasingly adopted the paradigm of using induction
chemotherapy to screen for patients with LAPC who do
not immediately develop metastases and thus are more
likely to benefit from targeted radiotherapy.12,13 Therefore, some patients in the current study cohort who
received chemotherapy were a favorable subgroup.
It is important to mention the results of the LAP 07
study, which to our knowledge is the largest LAPC
randomized trial published to date, and which randomized patients to receive chemoradiation or chemotherapy
after 4 months of gemcitabine with or without erlotinib.14
Results presented at the 2013 annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology demonstrated no
OS benefit with the addition of radiation after induction
chemotherapy; however, we await publication of the finalized data regarding secondary endpoints and quality of
life. In an era of more effective systemic regimens including FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid]
[FOL], 5-FU [F], irinotecan hydrochloride [IRIN], and
oxaliplatin [OX]) and gemcitabine=nab-paclitaxel, local
control may play an increasingly important role in
improving disease outcomes and quality of life.15,16

IORT given at the study institution offers the opportunity for local dose intensification. Several small
single-institution studies have reported encouraging local
control and OS results for patients with LAPC who are
treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy, a noninvasive,
high-dose, targeted radiation modality.17,18 Irreversible
electroporation is a minimally invasive tumor ablation
technique that may also improve outcomes in patients
with pancreatic cancer.19 Larger studies evaluating these
newer targeted local modalities will help to elucidate further the role of high-dose local therapy in patients with
LAPC.
To our knowledge, we are the first to highlight a
prognostic role for the CACI in patients with LAPC.
Although the prognostic value of the age-unadjusted CCI
has been previously demonstrated in patients with head
and neck, breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers
and the age-adjusted CACI has been reported as a prognostic factor in patients with colorectal and bladder cancer, to the best of our knowledge the implications of
pretreatment comorbidity in patients with pancreatic cancer have not been sufficiently studied.20-25 In 2011, Nakai
et al found CCI and performance status, but not age, to
4202

be prognostic factors among 237 patients treated with
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for unresectable
(including metastatic) pancreatic cancer.26 Similar to
theirs, in the current study age was not itself found to be a
prognostic factor for OS, but embedding age within the
CACI yielded stronger prognostic value than the CCI
alone.
Given that the patients in the current study cohort
were preselected to have generally good performance statuses, and given that most patients with pancreatic cancer
die of cancer rather than other causes, the question of how
CACI comorbidities (dominated in our patient cohort by
diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, chronic pulmonary disease,
and a history of myocardial infarction) may modulate outcomes in patients with LAPC merits further investigation.
Nakai et al have suggested that improved comorbidity
may correlate with a higher likelihood of receiving chemotherapy.26 Physiologically, given the potential for using
systemic inflammation indices such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score to predict OS in patients with pancreatic cancer, it is also possible that a lower baseline CACI
correlates with lower levels of cancer-promoting systemic
inflammation and=or better treatment tolerance.27 It is
interesting to note that despite growing interest in the specific comorbidity of diabetes as a potential negative prognostic factor in patients with pancreatic cancer, diabetes
status was not found to be associated with OS in the current study cohort.28
Finally, in comparison with our institution’s previously published experience, although an IORT applicator
diameter  8 cm predicted improved OS in our overall
multivariate model, our subset analysis of patients treated
with chemotherapy, which was most reflective of current
practice patterns, suggested that appropriately timed
chemotherapy coupled with favorable CACI can yield
good survival outcomes even in patients with larger primary tumors.

IORT Outcomes and Prognostics in LAPC/Cai et al

Overall, the patient cohort in the current study confirms that there is significant variability in outcomes
among patients with LAPC, even when they are preselected to have good performance statuses. Greater than
one-half of the patients in this cohort did not survive to 1
year, but a significant percentage survived to 3 years, and
the longest-surviving patient lived over 10 years. In an era
of targeted chemotherapy, genetic profiling is an increasingly sought-after technique for selecting those patients
most likely to respond to particular treatment regimens.
The genetic determinants of heterogeneity in the natural
course of pancreatic cancer have thus far remained elusive,
but the results of the current study suggest that clinical
determinants may still be of some value.
The current analysis has several limitations: it is a
single-institutional retrospective study with significant
treatment heterogeneity; we were unable to assess several
potentially valuable prognostic factors such as performance status; and our patient cohort was fairly homogeneous, with a relatively small number of patients in the
patient groups with poor prognostic factors.25,26 Nevertheless, as what to our knowledge is the largest study in
the literature to date to examine patients with LAPC who
are treated with IORT, the current study offers new
insight into some simple clinical guidelines that may help
to identify those patients with LAPC who are most likely
to achieve long-term survival after a multimodality treatment regimen.
