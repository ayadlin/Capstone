BACKGROUND: The management of relapsed aggressive lymphomas remains problematic. Ixabepilone (BMS-247550, epothilone B
analog), a potent inhibitor of tubulin disassembly, has promising preclinical and early-phase clinical activity in drug-resistant malignancies. METHODS: This multicenter phase 2 clinical trial tested the activity and safety of ixabepilone in relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma patients with either chemosensitive (at least a partial response [PR] to most recent chemotherapy) or chemoresistant
(less than PR to most recent chemotherapy) disease at 20 mg/m2 given intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.
RESULTS: Fifty-one enrolled patients with a median age of 66 years received at least 1 dose of ixabepilone. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 25; 49%), mantle cell lymphoma (n ¼ 16; 31%), and transformed follicular lymphoma (n ¼ 5; 10%) were the most frequent
histologies. Patients were heavily pretreated, with more than one-quarter having received 4 or more prior therapies. The overall
response rate was 27% (14 of 51 patients) with 12% (6 patients) experiencing complete responses and 16% (8 patients) with PRs. All
responses were in patients with chemosensitive disease. The median time to response was 2 cycles with a median duration of
response of 9.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Ixabepilone was well-tolerated, with neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue,
and nausea as the major toxicities. Ixabepilone has modest single-agent activity in patients with recurrent chemosensitive aggressive

INTRODUCTION
Major gains in front-line management of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) have not yet translated to the setting of relapsed disease. Intensive salvage approaches with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant benefit
an increasingly smaller subset of patients, and most patients with relapsed or primary refractory disease continue to have
suboptimal outcomes and limited treatment choices with no established standard of care.1,2 Ixabepilone (BMS-247550;
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) is a unique nontaxane tubulin inhibitor with preclinical activity in drug-resistant
models that could have a role in treatment of lymphomas displaying progressive chemoresistance.
The epothilones are naturally occurring nontaxane tubulin polymerization stabilizers.3,4 Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic derivative of epothilone B that binds to a site on the tubulin protein in close proximity to taxane binding sites, and
has greater potency than taxanes in multiple preclinical models. Ixabepilone has been studied in solid tumors, and is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, either
alone or in combination with capecitabine after failure of taxanes. Taxanes have previously been tested in NHL but have
limited activity.5 Ixabepilone binding stabilizes a- and b-tubulin heterodimers and prevents depolymerization, leading to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vitro ixabepilone is less susceptible to efflux by P-glycoprotein (ie, multidrug resistance-1
[MDR-1] efflux pump), a common mechanism of resistance for taxanes.6 In this regard, there is potential for activity in
settings where other drugs lose their efficacy. Its unique mechanism of action relative to other agents commonly used in
lymphomas makes ixabepilone an attractive agent to test in NHL.

lymphoma, Burkitt-like B-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (CD30þ, T cell, null cell, or Hodgkin-like types). There were 2 cohorts: cohort 1 (‘‘chemosensitive’’) enrolled patients with a complete response (CR) or
partial response (PR) lasting at least 4 weeks to their most
recent therapy; cohort 2 (‘‘chemoresistant’’) enrolled
patients with stable disease (SD) but less than a PR to their
most recent therapy. Patients with progression on their
most recent therapy were excluded. Notably, cohort 2 was
initially defined as patients without a sustained response to
front-line therapy of at least 4 weeks. However, accrual was
severely limited and the above definition was instituted after
discussions with the National Cancer Institute. There was
no limit to the number of prior regimens.
Additional eligibility requirements included: 1)
measurable disease (at least 1 lesion  10 mm in longest
diameter); 2) at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6
weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), radiation, or surgery; 3) age  18 years; 4) life expectancy of greater than 3
months; and 5) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status  2. Laboratory entry criteria included white blood cell count (WBC) > 3000/lL,
an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1200/lL, platelet
count > 100,000/lL, total bilirubin  1.5 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)
 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, and a creatinine of
 1.5 mg/dL, or a creatinine clearance  60 mL/minute.
Pertinent exclusion criteria were the presence of 
grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, pregnancy, known intracranial disease, history of allergic reaction to Cremophor,
known human immunodeficiency virus disease, active
second malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer
or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac
arrhythmia, or unstable angina pectoris. Patients immediately eligible and willing to undergo hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation were excluded. However, those
requiring debulking of disease prior to transplant were
allowed. Usage of St. John’s Wort, a potent inducer of
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), or cimetidine, a potent
inhibitor of CYP3A4, were prohibited during the study.
Informed consent was obtained from all enrolled
participants. This study was approved by the institutional
review boards of all participating centers and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Drug Administration

Ixabepilone was administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of
20 mg/m2 over 1 hour weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28day cycle following premedication with H1 and H2 antago1684

nists. A single dose escalation to 25 mg/m2 was allowed for
patients with < grade 4 leukopenia and neutropenia without
other toxicities  grade 2 in cycle 1. Treatment continued
until progression, intolerance, or physician-patient discretion. Patients could be removed from the study if their
response enabled their eligibility for stem cell transplantation. Supportive care, including the use of colony-stimulating factors, was allowed at the discretion of the treating
physician.
Dose reduction to 15 mg/m2 was required for any
patient with more than a 1-week treatment delay due to
toxicity, grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting despite maximal medical intervention, grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, grade 2
neuropathy (sensory or motor) lasting 7 or more days,
grade 3 neuropathy lasting < 7 days, and for those not
meeting hematologic criteria for retreatment 2 weeks after the last dose. Those requiring further dose reductions
or who developed  grade 3 neuropathy lasting  7 days
were removed from the study. No dose re-escalations
were allowed after dose reductions.
Study Design

The primary endpoint of this multicenter phase 2 study
was overall response rate in chemosensitive and chemoresistant relapsed aggressive lymphomas. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
Separate 2-stage Simon designs were designed for
the 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 (chemosensitive patients),
required at least 7 responses in the first 22 patients (Ho ¼
relative risk [RR]  30% versus H1 ¼ RR  50%; alpha
¼ 0.1; power ¼ 90%) in order to proceed to the second
stage of 24 additional patients. Ixabepilone would be
deemed worthy of further study in this population if  18
responses were seen among the 46 total cohort 1 patients.
Cohort 2 (chemoresistant patients) required at least 1
response in the first 15 enrolled patients (Ho ¼ RR <
10% versus H1 ¼ RR  30%; alpha ¼ 0.1; power ¼
91%) in order to proceed to the second stage of 15 additional patients. The drug would be considered worthy of
further study in this population if 7 or more responses
were seen among the 30 total cohort 2 patients.
Response Evaluations

Any patient exposed to at least 1 dose of ixabepilone was
in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Response assessment was done in both in the ITT population and in
patients completing at least 2 cycles of therapy with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
imaging every 2 cycles or every 8 weeks while on therapy.7
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans were not
required, but results were noted if performed.

Statistical Methods

Response rates are presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the binomial distribution.
Comparisons of responses between cohorts and across histologies were performed using Fisher’s exact test. The PFS
(time to disease progression or death from any cause) and
OS rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier8 estimator. For PFS, patients were censored at the time of last
contact if alive and disease-free; for both PFS and OS, one
patient was censored at the time of stem cell transplant.
The effects of baseline covariates on PFS and OS were
evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.9
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Fifty-two patients were enrolled at 9 centers from April
2003 to October 2009. One patient never received treatment and is excluded from analysis (Table 1). Accrual to
the study was slow, and the study was ultimately halted for
lack of accrual. There were 34 (67%) males and 17 (33%)
females with a median age of 66 years (range, 44-90 years).
Major histologies included: DLBCL (n ¼ 25; 49%), MCL
(n ¼ 16; 31%), and transformed FL (n ¼ 5; 10%). Patients
had a median of 3 prior therapies; more than one-quarter
of patients received 4 or more prior therapies. Forty-five
(88%) patients had prior rituximab-containing regimens.
Cohorts 1 and 2 were generally similar except for a slight
trend toward a poorer performance status and increased
bone marrow involvement in cohort 2 versus cohort 1.
Eleven patients had prior autologous stem cell transplant,
and 1 patient had prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Response

Among 51 patients exposed to at least 1 dose of study
drug (ITT population), the overall response rate (ORR)
was 27% (95% CI ¼ 16%-42%) (Table 2) including 6
(12%) CR/CRu (unconfirmed complete response) and 8
(16%) PR. All responses occurred in cohort 1 (chemosensitive patients). Compared with cohort 2, cohort 1 had a
significantly higher ORR (14 of 39 patients [36%] versus
0 of 12 patients [0%], P ¼ .022). An additional 25% (n ¼
8 in cohort 1 and n ¼ 5 in cohort 2) of patients had disease stabilization. Responses varied by histology: FL grade
3 (3 of 3 [100%]), transformed FL (2 of 5 [40%]), and
DLBCL (7 of 25 [28%]), and MCL (2 of 16 [13%]). No
responses were seen in the 2 patients with large cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) or with Burkittlike features. These differences were statistically significant (P ¼ .021). Among 14 responders, 12 (86%) had
received prior rituximab.

cycles proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant after
2 additional cycles. This patient was censored at the time
of transplant and is alive and free of disease at 35 months
follow-up.
Univariate analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 1.9; P ¼ .050) as the only
significant predictor of PFS, whereas age (HR ¼ 1.60 per
decade increase in age; P ¼ .003), ECOG performance
status (HR ¼ 2.4; P ¼ .01), and LDH (HR ¼ 3.6; P ¼
.001) were statistically significant predictors of OS. In
multivariate analysis, ECOG performance status (HR ¼
2.0; P ¼ .04) and LDH (HR ¼ 3.5; P ¼ .004) remained
significant predictors of OS.
Although not required by the study protocol, 18 of
51 patients had PET scans as part of their response evaluation. Among patients achieving a PR, SD, or PD, 4 of 15
(27%) had evidence of a significant metabolic response on
PET scan, including 1 patient with SD and 2 with a PR
achieving completely negative PET scans.
Study Drug Tolerance

A total of 41 of 51 patients (80%) completed at least 2
cycles of study drug and 17 (33%) received more than 2
cycles. The median cumulative dose administered was
246 mg delivered over a median of 2 cycles. The maximum cumulative dose received by any one patient was
570 mg. By cohort, 32 of 39 (82%) patients in cohort 1
and 9 of 12 (75%) patients in cohort 2 received at least 2
cycles of therapy. Ten patients did not complete 2 cycles

¼ 6; 12%). Sensory neuropathy of any grade occurred in
31 (61%) patients with grade 1 or 2 in 25 (49%) patients
and grade 3 in 6 (12%) patients, respectively. Motor neuropathy of grade 1 or 2 and grade 3 occurred in 4 (8%)

neuropathies observed. One patient with grade 3 sensory
neuropathy opted for study discontinuation despite
achieving a CR.
DISCUSSION
The paucity of effective options for relapsed aggressive
lymphomas makes the continued search for new agents
mandatory. The vast majority of patients with relapsed or
refractory aggressive lymphomas die of their disease, and
the median survival following failure of autologous stem
cell transplant is approximately 6 months. This phase 2
multicenter study sought to determine the overall and
complete response rate to an antitubulin cytotoxic agent,
ixabepilone, in a heavily pretreated group of patients with
either ‘‘chemosensitive’’ or ‘‘chemoresistant’’ relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas as defined above. Given
Cancer

preclinical evidence that ixabepilone is less susceptible to
common mechanisms of drug resistance, this was felt to
be an important question to test in patients.
Fifty-one patients received at least 1 dose of ixabepilone and constitute the ITT population. This was a heavily pretreated group of patients with 22% of patients
having previously undergone an autologous stem cell
transplant, and more than one-quarter of patients having
received at least 4 prior regimens; 88% of patients had
relapsed after prior rituximab-containing regimens. Despite the promising preclinical data showing efficacy in
chemorefractory models, no responses were observed
among patients in the chemoresistant cohort as defined in
this trial. On the other hand, among patients who had
responded to and subsequently relapsed after their most
recent chemotherapy, a response rate of 36% was
observed. One patient with stable disease by CT criteria
had a complete metabolic response by PET, and was successfully bridged to an allogeneic stem cell transplant; he
remains alive and free of disease 3 years later. Of all histologies enrolled, those with either grade 3 FL or transformed FL had the highest response rate (63% ORR).
Interestingly, the only complete responder in the study by
O’Connor et al occurred in a FL patient, and overall
responses were noted in 2 of 6 (33%) FL patients enrolled.
Although it is difficult to make conclusions on the basis of
these few patients, the pooled data from the study by
O’Connor et al and our study suggest a signal in follicle
center cell-derived lymphomas, which may be worth further investigation. Notably, at the time of enrollment of
FL patients on our study, a distinction between grade 3a
and 3b FL was not made; therefore, responses based on
these categories are not available.
Others have evaluated ixabepilone in lymphoid
malignancies. A phase 1 trial of ixabepilone in 61
advanced cancer patients included 15 patients with
relapsed lymphomas.10 Six patients responded, including 2 with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas failing prior
CHOP-based therapy; one of these patients achieved a
complete remission and the other a partial remission.10
These results prompted a multicenter phase 2 study of
ixabepilone in indolent lymphomas.11 O’Connor and
colleagues tested ixabepilone on a weekly schedule (25
mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 consecutive weeks) in 28
patients (22 evaluable) with heavily pretreated indolent
and mantle cell lymphomas. The response rate was
approximately 30%, with activity observed across
different histologies (FL, SLL/CLL, marginal zone
lymphoma, MCL). The duration of response ranged
from 2 to 8 months.

Even in our heavily pretreated population, ixabepilone was overall well tolerated, with the exception of neuropathic toxicity. The most common toxicities seen with
this dose and schedule were hematologic, sensory neuropathy, fatigue, and nausea. Peripheral sensory neuropathy
is a commonly reported toxicity with ixabepilone, with severity varying by dose and schedule. Phase 1/2 studies
mostly done in patients with solid tumors have suggested
that higher doses (ie, 40 mg/m2) given every 3 weeks are
associated with a greater incidence of the characteristic
length-dependent axonal polyneuropathy than with dosing schedules similar to those used in this trial.10 Here, we
observed some degree of sensory neuropathy in 61% of
patients, with grade 3 or 4 in 12% (6 of 51 patients).
Overall, more patients on our trial experienced neuropathy than the 28% reported by O’Connor and colleagues
when treating indolent NHL patients using the same dose
and schedule.11 The reason for this is unclear, because
patients on both studies received a median of 2 cycles of
therapy with only 33% on our study and 21% on the
study by O’Connor et al receiving more than 2 cycles. We
also observed a motor neuropathy in 12% (6 of 51) of
patients, which was not reported in other studies.
There are several limitations to the present study.
First, this trial had a long accrual period, during which
time several aspects of the care and treatment of patients
with aggressive NHL have changed. In particular, rituximab became widely available soon after this study began
and may have contributed to slow accrual. In addition,
this trial used 1999 CT-based criteria,7 which have now
been replaced with metabolic response criteria12 that
incorporate PET scans into response assessments. As
noted above, PET scans may have changed the response
classification of several patients on our trial.
Part of the appeal to testing ixabepilone is that, outside of vinca alkaloids, few other agents commonly used
in lymphomas target the microtubule apparatus. Paclitaxel and docetaxel have been tested in lymphomas, with
limited single-agent activity.13-21 The largest study of 96
lymphoma patients found an overall response rate of
25%, but many other trials have reported response rates
that were significantly lower. Although it is difficult to
compare different phase 2 studies, it seems that the
response rate to ixabepilone is at least similar and possibly
superior to that of the taxanes. In addition, the singleagent response rate of ixabepilone is similar to those
achieved by other agents currently in use. For example,
single-agent gemcitabine obtains only a 20% overall
response rate in aggressive lymphomas, but when combined with other agents, the response rate more than dou1688

bles, and gemcitabine-containing salvage regimens are
now commonplace in relapsed aggressive lymphomas.2224
Similarly, bendamustine has limited single-agent activity with an overall response rate of only 38% in relapsed
aggressive lymphomas, and yet combinations with rituximab are promising with response rates of 55% even in elderly patients and those with refractory disease.25,26 Thus,
ixabepilone may yet have a role in lymphomas, if the right
combination can be developed.
Despite encouraging activity, the further development of ixabepilone for lymphoma faces considerable hurdles because of numerous other candidate drugs under
development. Many of these have more immediate appeal
because of their rational design, targeting B-cell receptor
signaling or lymphoma-specific surface markers. In our
opinion, though, it would be premature to abandon
chemotherapy, because it remains the backbone of treatment, particularly in aggressive lymphomas. If multidrug
combinations can be further improved by incorporating
agents with a better therapeutic ratio, meaningful
improvements in outcome may result. Ixabepilone, with
its unique mechanism of action and limited myelosuppression, may be considered for incorporation in such
multidrug regimens.
