BACKGROUND: The Survivor’s Health and Reaction (SHARE) study examined health-related quality of life
(HRQL) in breast cancer patients who had participated in Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 8541 from
1985 to 1991. METHODS: In total, 245 survivors (78% of eligible patients) who were 9.4 to 16.5 years postdiagnosis (mean, 12.5 years postdiagnosis) completed HRQL surveys relating to 5 domains. Analyses examined HRQL domains according to 3 different chemotherapy dose levels that were administered in the
original treatment trial: low-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) at 300 mg/m2, 30
mg/m2, and 300  2 mg/m2, respectively, over 4 cycles; standard-dose CAF at 400 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2, and
400  2 mg/m2, respectively, over 6 cycles; and high-dose CAF at 600 mg/m2, 60 mg/m2 and 600  2 mg/
m2, respectively, over 4 cycles. RESULTS: In univariate analyses, a statistically significant difference was
observed on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form Physical Role Functioning subscale by treatment group, with lower mean scores in the standard treatment arm (mean, 65.05) compared with mean
scores in the low-dose arm (mean, 74.66) and the high-dose arm (mean, 84.94; P.0001). However, multivariate analysis revealed that treatment arm no longer was statistically significant, whereas the following factors were associated with decreased physical role functioning: age 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.55; P ¼
.006), increased comorbidity interference total score (OR, 1.64; P ¼ .005), lower vitality (OR, 1.05; P ¼
.0002), and increased menopausal symptoms (OR, 1.04 P ¼ .02). CONCLUSIONS: At 9.4-16.5 years after
their original diagnosis, differences in physical role functioning among breast cancer survivors who had
received 3 different dose levels of chemotherapy were explained by clinical and demographic variables,
such as age, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and comorbidities. Prospective studies are needed to further
assess the role of these factors in explaining HRQL and physical role functioning among long-term surviC 2009 American Cancer Society.

FIGURE 1. The quality-of-life (QOL) model was adapted for breast cancer survivors (adapted from Dow et al.5 and Ferrell et al.11)

Advances in early detection and treatment have led
to increased numbers of breast cancer survivors, totaling
approximately 2.4 million in 2007.1,2 This increase in
survivors raises concerns about the long-term effects of
cancer treatment on health-related quality of life
(HRQL).
Several studies have reported good overall HRQL
among long-term survivors but have identified issues,
such as sexual concerns, psychosocial problems, and physical symptoms, including pain and lymphedema.3-7 It has
been demonstrated that the adverse effects of systemic adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy) on global HRQL, physical
functioning, bodily pain, and sexual functioning worsen 5
to 10 years after the initial diagnosis in patients with
breast cancer.3,6
Ahles et al. revealed gaps in knowledge regarding the
effects of cancer treatment in long-term breast cancer survivors, because few studies exist.8 Ganz et al. observed few
differences in the effects of adjuvant treatment on HRQL
and emotional functioning in breast cancer survivors 3
years post-treatment but discovered significant differences
in global HRQL, general health, and physical and social
functioning after 6 years of follow-up.9 Bottomley et al.
reported declines in HRQL 3 months after treatment but
observed that these effects largely had diminished 3 years
post-treatment.10 Ahles et al. also emphasized the impor1110

tance of assessing the impact of chemotherapy on HRQL
to make cancer survivors aware of potentially negative
outcomes of cancer treatment and for the development of
interventions to cope with negative side effects of treatment.8 Thus, past studies have produced inconsistent
results regarding the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on
long-term HRQL. This issue has important implications
for breast cancer survivors and, thus, needs further study.
The theoretical framework for this study was derived
from the quality-of-life model adapted for cancer survivors by Dow et al. and Ferrell et al (Fig. 1).5,11 The model
identifies 4 major areas of HRQL in cancer patients: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well being. It has
been tested in several studies with specific issues identified
within each domain.12,13 In the current study, the social
well being area was subdivided into social and economic
well being. Thus, 5 domains plus medical and demographic variables were assessed.
The primary objective of the current study was to
assess whether adjuvant chemotherapy dose of a commonly used breast cancer treatment regimen (combined
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil [CAF])
was associated with differences in 5 HRQL domains
(physical, psychological, social, spiritual, and economic)
among long-term breast cancer survivors (9-16 years after
their initial diagnosis) who had participated in Cancer

HRQL in Long-Term Breast CA Survivors/Paskett et al

and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Treatment Trial 8541.
Because of conflicting evidence from past studies and
because these women had survived for 9 to 16 years, we
hypothesized that there would be differences among the
treatment arms that could result in higher or lower
HRQL. Our secondary objective was to identify factors
that currently exhibited significant differences by treatment arm, such as comorbidities, treatment variables, and
demographic variables, including age, education, and
socioeconomic status (SES). The identification of these
factors may be useful for interventions to improve HRQL
among long-term survivors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting
The current study (CALGB 79804) examined HRQL in
breast cancer patients who had participated in CALGB
8541 from 1985 to 1991. The objective of CALGB 8541
was to determine whether a dose-dependent relation
existed between disease-free survival, dose, and dose intensity for patients with stage II breast cancer who were
assigned randomly to receive 1 of the following CAF adjuvant therapy regimens for surgically resected breast cancer:
low-dose CAF (cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2, doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 300  2 mg/m2 over 4
cycles), standard-dose CAF (400 mg/m2, 40 mg/m2, and
400  2 mg/m2, respectively, over 6 cycles), and highdose CAF (600 mg/m2, 60 mg/m2, and 600  2 mg/m2,
respectively, over 4 cycles).14,15
The results of the trial indicated that, after a median
follow-up of 3.4 years, women who received high- or
standard-dose/intensity CAF had significantly longer disease-free survival (P < .001) and overall survival (P ¼
.004) than women who received low-dose/intensity CAF
in log-rank comparisons with 3 degrees of freedom.14,15
The difference in survival between the 2 groups that
received standard- and high-dose/intensity was not
significant.
Of 1572 women who were randomized in the
CALGB 8541 trial, approximately 618 women were alive
and cancer-free when the current study began in 1999.
Because accrual for CALGB 8541 occurred from 1985 to
1991, participants in this study were 9.4 to 16.5 years
postdiagnosis (mean, 12.5 years postdiagnosis). The study
Cancer

March 1, 2009

was approved by the institutional review boards of each
participating institution, and all patients provided
informed consent before participating in this study.
Procedures
Details of the study methods have been provided elsewhere.16 In brief, clinical research associates (CRAs) at
CALGB treating institutions were notified of patient eligibility by the CALGB Statistical Center. CRAs confirmed patient disease status (alive and disease-free) and
informed the treating physician of the study. Next, either
the CRA contacted the patient about the study, or an introductory letter was sent from the principal investigator
(E.P.) noting the physician’s permission to contact the
patient. A consent form and questionnaire were sent,
which were completed, signed, and returned by the
women who wished to participate. Nonrespondents were
contacted by telephone to complete the survey (N ¼ 8), if
necessary. When they completed the questionnaire,
patients were registered with the CALGB Statistical
Center.
In total, 618 women from 42 CALGB institutions
were identified by the CALGB Statistical Center for
potential participation in this study. Eligibility criteria
consisted of participation in CALGB 8541, breast cancerfree for 12 months, free of other cancers in the past 5 years
(except basal/squamous skin or in situ cervical cancers),
physician approval to participate, and ability to complete
the English-language questionnaire. Figure 2 shows the
exclusions that were made. Reasons for ineligibility
included death or disease recurrence and lack of physician
approval. Thus, 314 women were eligible to participate,
and 245 women (78%) returned the surveys. Participants
did not differ significantly from nonparticipants (CALGB
8541 survivors who were not eligible to participate in the
follow-up study) by age, treatment arm, number of positive lymph nodes, or age/year of entry in CALGB 8541
(data not shown). However, more white survivors than
nonwhite survivors chose to participate (93% vs 81%;
P < .0001).
Measures
The following questionnaires were used to assess HRQL
domains by treatment arm in this study, and higher scores
represented increased levels of the outcome assessed.

Quality of life
The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form

Overall HRQL was assessed using 8 dimensions on
the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item short form
(SF-36): physical functioning, role limitations, bodily
pain, general health perceptions, vitality (fatigue), social
functioning, emotional well being, and perceived changes
in health status.17,18 Subscales were scored from 0 to 100,
and higher scores indicated better HRQL. Lower vitality
scores indicated greater fatigue.
Psychological well being

ble, affectionate, and positive social interaction.24,25 All
subscale scores and the total score were examined.
Life Events Scale

Stressful life events were assessed with this 11-item
survey, which has been used in past studies.26 Both the
number and frequency of events were examined.
Spiritual well being
System of Beliefs Inventory

Religious/spiritual beliefs were measured with this
15-item scale.27 Two subscales, Spiritual Beliefs Practices
and Community Social Support, and the total score were
examined.
Economic well being
Employment and insurance difficulties

Breast Cancer Anxiety and Screening Behavior
Scale

This modified 21-item scale assessed the emotional
and cognitive aspects of breast cancer20 and demonstrated
high validity with breast cancer worries and generalized
anxiety scales.20-23 All subscales were examined, including
intrusive and avoidant thoughts and total cognitive
distress.
Social well being
Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey

This validated, 20-item survey measured 4 areas of
perceived social support: emotional/informational, tangi1112

The overall impact of breast cancer diagnosis on
employment and insurance was assessed with 2 questions
from this survey,28 which were developed for previous
CALGB survivor studies.7,29
Physical well being
Your Health-short form

This modified version of the validated Older Americans Resources and Services comorbidity scale30 assessed
the following illnesses/comorbidities (no/yes): heart disease, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, circulation problems in arms/legs, stroke, depression, chronic
liver/kidney disease, stomach/intestinal disorders,

osteoporosis, arthritis, glaucoma, and emphysema. An ‘interference score’ (ie, interference with daily activities) was
assessed using a 3-point scale (1, not at all; 2, somewhat;
3, a great deal).30
Pain and Lymphedema Questionnaire

This 12-item module documented the occurrence
and duration of treatment-related swelling and pain in the
arms/hands.31
Menopause and Reproductive Health Questionnaire

This 47-item survey asked participants whether they
had experienced particular physical symptoms (yes/no)
and whether the severity was mild, moderate, or severe. A
total score assessed both frequency and severity.
Medical information/demographics

The medical file in the CALGB 8541 database provided demographics and the following information: date
of study entry, treatment arm, menopausal status (at diagnosis), the number of positive lymph nodes at diagnosis,
tumor size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status,
and performance status (according to the Karnofsky performance scale32). Current demographics, such as age,
education, income, and insurance status, were obtained
from a supplemental demographic survey for the current
study.
Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by statisticians at the
CALGB Statistical Center (J.H. and K.D.). Descriptive
statistics were used to characterize HRQL domains and
clinical characteristics of survivors by treatment arm.
Power analyses for this study revealed 90% power to
detect a clinically significant difference in physical role
functioning, in which 1 group differed from the other
groups by >0.5 standard deviations, assuming a ¼ .05
(2-sided) and sample sizes of 74 patients, 93 patients, and
8 patients for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups,
respectively.33
Because of skewed distributions and a ceiling effect
for many of the survey scores, the nonparametric KruskalWallis test was used to compare survey scores by treatment
arm. All other categorical data were analyzed using the
Fisher exact test. The Jonckhere-Terpstra34 test was used
Cancer

March 1, 2009

to test for a dose-response relation between treatment
dose and survey score. Statistical tests were calculated
using exact methods from Monte Carlo simulations and
were 2-sided, using a ¼ .05. The null hypothesis in these
comparisons was that there were no differences in survey
scores between treatment arms. The alternative hypothesis
was that at least 1 arm had a significantly higher or lower
score compared with the other arms.
The correlation between treatment arm and physical
role functioning was analyzed using logistic regression.
Physical role functioning, which was the outcome for this
analysis because it was the only HRQL variable that demonstrated a statistically significant association with treatment arm (P ¼ .001), was dichotomized (100 vs <100)
because of the discrete nature of the distribution. Higher
SES was defined as having private health insurance, having a household income $20,000, and being a high
school graduate; otherwise, women were classified as having lower SES.35 Other variables in the logistic regression
analysis were age at interview (60 years vs <60 years),
the number of comorbidities (0 vs 1), the type of surgery
(lumpectomy vs mastectomy), ER status (negative vs positive), hormone therapy (no vs yes), radiation therapy (no
vs yes), high blood pressure interfering with daily life (no/
not applicable vs yes), diabetes interfering with daily life
(no/not applicable vs yes), vitality score, menopausal
symptom score, comorbidity interference total score, and
time since diagnosis, which was stratified by its median
(12.3 years). Variables that were significant at the 25%
level based on the Wald chi-square test were included in
the multivariate model using stepwise selection methods.
The selection criterion was based on the score chi-square
statistic, using a ¼ .05. The Wald chi-square statistic was
used to determine whether a factor should remain in the
model (a ¼ .05).

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants by treatment arm.
Seventy-four patients (30%) had received low-dose chemotherapy, 93 patients (38%) had received the standard
dose, and 78 patients (32%) had received the highest
dose. Age and race did not differ significantly between the
3 groups. Differences were evident regarding education

less educated; P ¼ .04). No significant differences were
observed in the distribution of comorbidities that interfered with daily life by treatment group (results not
shown).
Table 2 shows the distribution of MOS SF-36 subscales by treatment arm. The mean scores were highest for
the intensive treatment arm and lowest for the standard
arm for all but the Mental Health subscale, and the only
statistically significant difference was observed in Physical
Role Functioning (P < .0001). Trends toward significance were observed for General Health Perceptions (P ¼
.06), Emotional Role Functioning (P ¼ .07), and Vitality
(P ¼ .09) subscales, with lower scores observed in the
standard treatment arm. There were no significant doseresponse relations by treatment arm (results not shown).
Table 3 displays the HRQL domain items examined
by treatment arm. Overall, approximately 80% of women
indicated having 1 or more comorbidities, and 20% of
women had possible depression (a score 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). They
also had high MOS Social Support scores (mean score,
>78). In examining the Social Support Systems of Belief
subscale, a trend toward significantly higher social support
was observed in the standard treatment arm (P ¼ .07).
There were no significant dose-response relations by treatment arm (results not shown).
The association of demographic and medical characteristics with decreased physical role functioning was analyzed using logistic regression. The univariate results
Cancer

March 1, 2009

(Table 4) showed a highly significant relation between
treatment arm and decreased physical role functioning
(odds ratio [OR], 3.17; P ¼ .0009). Other factors that
were associated with reduced physical role functioning
were lower SES (OR, 2.76; P ¼ .0004), age 60 years
(OR, 1.85; P ¼ .03), 1 comorbid condition(s) (OR,
4.76; P ¼ .0001), lower vitality (OR, 1.06; P < .0001),
increasing menopausal symptom score (OR, 1.07; P <
.0001), higher comorbidity interference total score (OR,
2.81; P < .0001), and positive ER status (OR, 2.17;
P ¼ .009).
Variables that were significant at the 25% level in
the univariate analysis were included in the stepwise
selection process to derive the multivariate model (Table
5). Vitality, menopausal symptoms, age, and comorbidity interference total scores all had significant associations with physical role functioning, but treatment arm
and SES no longer were significant. Older patients (OR,
3.55; P ¼ .006), patients with higher comorbidity total
interference scores (OR, 1.64; P ¼ .005), patients with
higher menopausal symptom scores (OR, 1.04; P ¼
.02), and women with reduced vitality (fatigue; OR,
1.05; P ¼ .0002) were more likely to report decreased

functioning emerged as the only statistically significant
outcome. Trends toward significance were observed for
variables such as general health perceptions, vitality, emotional role functioning, and social functioning. These
results are similar to those reported by Ganz et al., who
observed that 6-year survivors who received adjuvant therapy reported lower levels of physical role functioning as
well as general health, bodily pain, physical functioning,
and social functioning.6,9 Ahles et al. also reported significantly lower scores in social and physical domains among
10-year survivors who received chemotherapy versus local
therapy.8 Others have reported poorer physical role functioning among patients 5 years postchemotherapy compared with patients without cancer36 and patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy.3
Unlike previous studies in which a dose-response
relation was observed, in the current study, we observed
the lowest mean SF-36 subscale scores in the standarddose group followed by the low-dose and high-dose
groups. Survivors in the standard-dose group also had
trends toward significantly higher levels of Systems of

These findings may be because survivors in the standard
group had less education or perhaps were less healthy than
survivors in the other groups. Future studies should examine similar dose-intensities and their effect on HRQL.
In further examining the relation of physical role
functioning by treatment arm, logistic regression analyses
revealed that treatment arm no longer was associated significantly with HRQL after adjusting for factors such as
age, fatigue, menopausal symptoms, and comorbidities
that interfered with daily life. In a recent prospective
study, lower levels of physical role functioning were
observed among women 1 year after they received highdose chemotherapy and remained stable for >4 years but
had small effect sizes that were clinically irrelevant.37 In
that study, when age and menopausal status were assessed
as covariates, postmenopausal women exhibited lower
physical role functioning scores. Other studies also
reported lower levels of HRQL in physical/role functioning domains in patients who received high-dose chemotherapy, but those levels returned to baseline 1 year after
treatment.10,38,39 The current results, however, provide
information regarding which patients may be at risk for
reduced physical role functioning after the receipt of any
dose of this adjuvant therapy regimen.
Age was related significantly to physical role functioning in this study and typically was associated with
lower HRQL in past studies. Older survivors have
reported decreased physical role functioning,40,41 more
physical problems, depressed mood, and days affected by
fatigue.42,43
Comorbidities that interfered with daily life, which
were related significantly to physical role functioning in
this study, consistently affected HRQL. Depression, diabetes, and circulation trouble also were evident in women
with lower education levels. Past studies have
1117

Original Article

demonstrated that poorer HRQL among lower SES
groups may be related to increased comorbidities and
reduced access to care. Patients with lower education levels have reported more physical symptoms, such as tiredness, decreased sexual interest, and painful muscles.37
Fatigue was related significantly to physical role
functioning in this study. Fatigue often is reported as a
long-term side effect of breast cancer treatment that persists years after active treatment.6,7,44,45 Comorbidities,
such as high blood pressure, which were prevalent in this
study, have been related to fatigue in previous studies.45
The presence of joint and muscle pain also has been associated with fatigue.46-48 Patients who most frequently
reported symptoms like such as pain and fatigue 5 years
post-treatment scored significantly lower on HRQL at
baseline compared with other patients.37 Future studies
should assess these domains at baseline and their possible
interactions with other factors, because differences may be
predictive of future outcomes.
Regarding menopausal symptoms, which had a statistically significantly association with physical role functioning, Schultz et al. concluded, that despite ‘complex
interactions’ between HRQL indicators and physiologic
effects of treatment, menopausal symptoms may not be
different for breast cancer survivors and should not be
confused with quality-of-life/psychosocial issues.49
Others have demonstrated that HRQL differences could
not be explained by menopausal symptoms alone and that
more research is needed in this area.36
There were several strengths of this study. First, it
focused on the HRQL domain of physical role functioning and factors that influence this domain that have not
been explored in previous studies. Second, it examined
survivors 9 to 16 years after their primary diagnosis, which
few studies have done. Third, the women were diagnosed
at relatively the same disease stage and received 1 of 3
known chemotherapy regimens within the same clinical
trial, thus reducing variability because of treatment and
stage of diagnosis. Many previous studies have used heterogeneous populations in examining stage and treatment.
Limitations of this study include reliance on selfreported comorbidities, such as lymphedema and osteoporosis. Information on temporal changes in HRQL was
not assessed, because HRQL was examined at only 1 time
point. In addition, a survival bias may have occurred
whereby patients with better HRQL were more likely to
1118

be long-term survivors and, thus, eligible to participate in
the follow-up study. However, analyses demonstrated few
differences between CALGB 8541 survivors who did and
did not participate in this study. These limitations emphasize the need for prospective, long-term studies of HRQL
in breast cancer survivors from treatment through
survivorship.
Although chemotherapy provides a great survival
benefit for cancer patients, it provides potential long-term
side effects that may have great impact on HRQL. The
current study demonstrated that, whereas the adjuvant
chemotherapy dose initially was related to lower HRQL
in physical role functioning, this effect actually was
explained by demographic and clinical factors, which can
be used in targeting HRQL interventions for long-term
survivors. The clinical significance of these factors and
their role as potential areas for interventions in improving
HRQL need to be explored further in prospective studies
of HRQL in long-term breast cancer survivors.
