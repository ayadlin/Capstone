Abstract
Aurora A is a serine/threonine protein kinase essential for
normal mitotic progression. Aberrant increased expression of
Aurora A, which occurs frequently in human cancers, results
in abnormal mitoses leading to chromosome instability and
possibly tumorigenesis. Consequently, Aurora A has received
considerable attention as a potential target for anticancer
therapeutic intervention. Aurora A coordinates several essential mitotic activities through phosphorylation of a variety of
proteins, including TACC3, which modulates microtubule
stabilization of the mitotic spindle. Recent studies identified
a conserved serine in Xenopus (Ser626) and Drosophila (Ser863)
TACC3 orthologues that is phosphorylated by Aurora A. We
show that this conserved serine on human TACC3 (Ser558) is
also phosphorylated by Aurora A. Moreover, phosphorylation
of TACC3 by Aurora A in human cells is essential for its proper
localization to centrosomes and proximal mitotic spindles.
Inhibition of Aurora A with the selective small molecule
inhibitor MLN8054 in cultured human tumor cells resulted in
mislocalization of TACC3 away from mitotic spindles in a
concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, oral administration of MLN8054 to nude mice bearing HCT-116 human
tumor xenografts caused a dose-dependent mislocalization of
TACC3 away from spindle poles that correlated with tumor
growth inhibition. As TACC3 localization to mitotic spindles
depends on Aurora A–mediated phosphorylation, quantifying
TACC3 mislocalization represents a novel pharmacodynamic
approach for measuring Aurora A activity in cancer patients
treated with inhibitors of Aurora A kinase. [Cancer Res
2007;67(11):5362–70]

Introduction
Aurora A belongs to a highly conserved family of serine/
threonine protein kinases that also includes Aurora B and Aurora
C. The Aurora A gene maps to chromosomal region 20q13.2, which
is frequently amplified in a diverse array of human cancers (1–6).
Amplification of the Aurora A gene is implicated in oncogenesis
and tumor progression. For instance, increased Aurora A
expression in experimental rodent models induces centrosome
amplification, chromosome instability, and aneuploidy, resulting in

malignant transformation (6, 7). Moreover, targeted forced
expression of Aurora A in the mouse mammary gland induces
mitotic abnormalities that precede tumor formation (8, 9).
Aurora A localizes to centrosomes and proximal mitotic spindles
where it coordinates essential mitotic activities including centrosome separation, mitotic spindle formation, chromosome alignment, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and cytokinesis (10–15).
These distinct activities are orchestrated by Aurora A through its
interaction with, and phosphorylation of, a variety of mitotic
proteins, including TACC3.
Recent studies identified the conserved residues Ser626 of
Xenopus TACC3 (Maskin) and Ser863 of Drosophila TACC3 (DTACC) as the site phosphorylated by Aurora A (16–18). This site is
conserved in human TACC3 (Ser558). Localization of TACC proteins
to centrosomes was shown to be dependent on phosphorylation by
Aurora A in Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, and Drosophila, and it
was proposed that this phosphorylation is required for regulating
mitotic spindle pole dynamics and organization (16–20). TACC
proteins recruit and form a complex at the centrosomes with the
Minispindles (Msps)/XMAP215/ch-TOG (colon and hepatic tumor
overexpressing gene) family of microtubule-associated proteins
(19, 21–23). In this complex, TACC3 modulates the microtubule
stabilizing activity of Msps/XMAP215/ch-TOG. For example,
mutant D-TACC in Drosophila embryos as well as TACC3-depleted
HeLa cells cannot properly localize Msps/ch-TOG to centrosomes,
resulting in abnormally short and partially destabilized spindle
centrosomal microtubules as well as defects in chromosome
congression (21, 22). These mitotic defects lead to an accumulation
of cells in the G2-M cell cycle phases, phenotypes shared by Aurora
A inhibition (24, 25).
The oncogenic potential and essential role in mitosis of Aurora A
make it an intriguing target for anticancer therapeutic intervention
(26, 27). Knockdown of the protein in human tumor cells by RNA
interference (RNAi) or inactivation of the kinase using antibody
microinjection causes mitotic accumulation and eventual apoptosis (25, 28, 29). MLN8054 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is the
first selective small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A to enter clinical
trials in patients with advanced cancers. MLN8054 inhibits
proliferation of a diverse group of cultured human tumor cell
lines and possesses antitumor activity against human xenografts
grown in nude mice (24).
Until now, there have been no reports of direct pharmacodynamic
markers for measuring Aurora A inhibition in cancer patients.
Although Aurora A inhibition can be monitored through an
increased mitotic index, this approach may have limitations as the
ensuing mitotic arrest is transient. Moreover, antibody reagents
detecting phosphorylated Aurora A substrates may not be sufficiently robust for accurate detection in clinical tumor specimens.

TACC3 Localization: An Aurora A Pharmacodynamic Assay

Here, we examine TACC3 localization to centrosomes and
proximal mitotic spindles as a direct pharmacodynamic measure of
Aurora A activity in tumors. Specifically, we show that human
Aurora A phosphorylates TACC3 on Ser558. Mutation of this site
to an alanine decreases localization of TACC3 to the centrosomes
and proximal mitotic spindles in human colon tumor cells. Using
MLN8054, we show that inhibition of Aurora A activity in cultured
cells prevents proper localization of endogenous TACC3 in a
concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, oral administration of MLN8054 to mice bearing human tumor xenografts also
disrupted TACC3 localization in tumor sections. In summary, this
work introduces a novel pharmacodynamic method for measuring
Aurora A activity by quantifying the loss of TACC3 from
centrosomes and proximal mitotic spindles.

Materials and Methods
Mammalian and bacterial expression vectors. TACC3 (amino acids
331–838) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pDest15
(Invitrogen) containing an NH2-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)
fusion. The product of this construct was expressed in Escherichia coli and
is referred to as GST-DTACC3. Serine to alanine mutations in residues 399,
402, and 558 in various combinations were generated by site-directed
mutagenesis. Full-length TACC3 was cloned into the mammalian retroviral
expression vector pLNCX (BD Biosciences) containing an NH2-terminal
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag (pLNCX/EGFP-WT TACC3).
A serine to alanine mutation in residue 558 of TACC3 was generated by sitedirected mutagenesis (pLNCX/EGFP-MUT TACC3).
In vitro kinase assay. Recombinant Aurora A (100 ng) prepared as
described previously (24) was incubated in kinase buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 Amol/L ATP] and 10 ACi g-[32P]ATP alone or in
the presence of various substrates, including 2 Ag of bacterially expressed
GST-DTACC3 (wild type or Ser399, Ser402, and Ser558 to alanine mutants in
various combinations), GST-cyclin B1, and histone H1 (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the
addition of NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and the proteins were
resolved by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography.
Identification of TACC3 phosphorylated residues. Purified GSTDTACC3 (30 Ag) was incubated in kinase buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 100 Amol/L ATP] alone or in the presence
of recombinant Aurora A (1.5 Ag) for 30 min at room temperature.
The reactions were stopped, and TACC3 phosphorylated residues were
identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) as previously described (30).
EGFP-WT TACC3 and EGFP-MUT TACC3 stable cells. To generate
retrovirus, 1.5  106 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) grown on 10-cm tissue
culture dishes were cotransfected with 2 Ag pLNCX/EGFP-WT TACC3 or
pLNCX/EGFP-MUT TACC3 with 2 Ag pN8q-VSV-G and 2 Ag pN8q-gag-pol.
Preparation of the pN8q-VSV-G and pN8q-gag-pol vectors was previously
described (31). Transfections were done using LipofectAMINE reagent
according to the manufacturer’s recommended methods (Invitrogen). Viral
supernatants were harvested every 24 h for 72 h, passed through a 0.45-Am
filter (Pall Gelman Laboratories), and stored at 80jC. For infection into
HCT-116 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection),
viruses were diluted 1:1 in McCoy’s Modified 5A media (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine
serum (Hyclone), and 8 Ag/mL polybrene (Sigma). Following three
12-h rounds of transduction, stable expressing pools were selected with
500 Ag/mL G418. Wild-type pools are referred to as EGFP-WT TACC3, and
Ser558 to Ala mutant pools are referred to as EGFP-MUT TACC3. Stable
pools (2  105 cells) were grown on glass coverslips (18  18  1.5 mm,
VWR) in six-well tissue culture dishes in McCoy’s Modified 5A media
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum for
38 h. DMSO (0.2%) or MLN8054 (1 Amol/L) were added for 2 h, and cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences)
followed by incubation with Hoechst 33321 (1:5,000; Molecular Probes) in

www.aacrjournals.org

PBS for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and mounted onto glass
slides with Fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Cells were
visualized with a LSM 5 Pascal Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Zeiss),
and images were processed using Metamorph Version 6.3R7 (Molecular
Devices).
Immunoblotting. HCT-116, EGFP-WT TACC3, and EGFP-MUT TACC3
cells were lysed in NP40 buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% NP40] containing phosphatase and
protease inhibitors (5 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail Set; Calbiochem). The lysates were clarified by
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min and denatured by heating to
100jC in NuPAGE SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE,
Western blotted, and detected with the ECL Western Blotting Detection
System (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies used for Western
blotting included anti-TACC3 rabbit antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz, H300)
and anti-h-actin mouse antibody (1:10,000; Abcam). The secondary
antibodies used were sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase–linked
whole antibody (1:2,500; Amersham) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase–linked whole antibody (1:2,500; Amersham).
Immunofluorescence. HCT-116 cells grown on glass coverslips as
described above were treated with DMSO (0.2%) or MLN8054 (1 Amol/L) for
4 h followed by 100 nmol/L bortezomib (VELCADE; Millennium
Pharmaceuticals) for the last 2 h. Bortezomib inhibits the proteosome,
thereby blocking mitotic cells at the metaphase to anaphase transition.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100 in PBS. Blocking Reagent (Roche) was added to cells for 30 min
followed by 1 h of incubation with the primary antibody in Blocking
Reagent. Cells were washed in PBS and in PBS containing 0.05% Tween
followed by addition of the secondary antibody in Blocking Reagent for 1 h.
Cells were washed with PBS and Hoeschst 33321 in PBS (1:10,000; Molecular
Probes) was added for 5 min. Primary antibodies included anti-TACC3
rabbit antibody (1:1,000), anti–Ipl1- and aurora-related kinase 1 (IAK1)
mouse monoclonal antibody (1:75; BD Biosciences PharMingen), anti-NuMA
mouse antibody (1:100; Calbiochem, Ab-2 107-7), anti-a-tubulin (1:500;
Sigma, clone DM1A), and anti–phosphorylated Aurora A Thr288 (Aurora A
pThr288; 1:100, Millennium Pharmaceuticals). Secondary antibodies included
Alexa 488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250; Molecular Probes) and
Alexa 594–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:250; Molecular Probes).
Immunofluorescently labeled cells were visualized, and images were
processed as described above.
TACC3 localization assay. HCT-116 or HT29 cells (obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection) were grown on 96-well tissue culture
dishes (2.5  103 per well) for 40 h in McCoy’s Modified 5A media
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and
10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Compounds were added to cells in 2-fold
serial dilution, and cells were incubated in a 37jC humidified cell culture
chamber for 2.5 h. Compounds at each dilution were added as replicates in
three rows on the dish. Cells treated with DMSO (n = 3 wells per plate;
0.2% final concentration) served as the vehicle control. After treatment,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeated with 0.5% Triton
X-100. The cells were treated with Blocking Reagent (Roche) for 20 min and
were then stained with anti-TACC3 rabbit antibody (1:1,000) and anti-IAK1
mouse monoclonal antibody (1:75) in Blocking Reagent followed by Alexa
488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250), Alexa 594–conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (1:250), and Hoechst 33321 (1:5,000) in Blocking Reagent.
The cells were visualized using a Discovery-1 High Content Imaging System
(Molecular Devices). Images from nine sites per well were collected at 20
magnification. Five Z-sections were acquired at 2-Am increments and were
compressed to single images at each site using Metamorph Version 6.3R7
(Molecular Devices) to ensure that all fluorescent structures throughout
the volume of each cell were captured. TACC3 intensity maps (Fig. 4)
were generated by computing TACC3 fluorescent intensity within the
indicated areas using ProGuru. ProGuru is a software program developed
at Millennium Pharmaceuticals designed for custom quantitative highcontent image analysis and visualization. TACC3 localization to the
centrosomes was determined by measuring TACC3 fluorescent intensity
within IAK1 immunopositive centrosomes using ProGuru software (Fig. 5).

Metamorph version 6.3R7.

Results
TACC3 is phosphorylated on Ser558 by Aurora A in vitro. To
identify residues on human TACC3 phosphorylated by Aurora A,
in vitro kinase assays were done. Aurora A robustly phosphorylated
GST-DTACC3 (TACC3 amino acids 331–838 fused to NH2-terminal
GST; Fig. 1A, autoradiogram). Expression of GST-DTACC3 resulted
in a number of degradation products (Fig. 1A, CBB stain), some
which were phosphorylated by Aurora A in this assay. Low or
undetectable levels of phosphorylation were detected when Aurora
A was incubated with GST alone, histone H1, or GST-fused to cyclin
B1. Aurora A also underwent detectable autophosphorylation
except in the presence of GST-DTACC3, which may have been due
to the reaction stoichiometry favoring TACC3 as a substrate.
Microcapillary LC-MS/MS was used to identify phosphorylated
TACC3 residues from GST-DTACC3 phosphorylated in vitro by
Aurora A. Three phosphorylated residues were identified by this
method: Ser399, Ser402, and Ser558 (Fig. 1B). To confirm that Aurora
A phosphorylated TACC3 on these serines, GST-DTACC3 containing serine to alanine mutations in these residues in various
combinations were used as substrates in an in vitro kinase assay
with Aurora A (Fig. 1C). Radiolabeling of GST-DTACC3 containing
Ser399Ala or Ser402Ala mutations was similar to that of wild-type
GST-DTACC3, indicating that the identification of these residues as
putative Aurora A phosphorylation sites may have been an artifact
of MS analysis. Radiolabeling was not detected in any GST-DTACC3
containing Ser558Ala mutations. Therefore, we conclude that
Aurora A phosphorylated GST-DTACC3 on Ser558. This was
consistent with previous studies showing that Aurora A phosphor-

ylates Drosophila and Xenopus TACC3 on a conserved residue
corresponding to mammalian TACC3 Ser558 (16, 17, 32).
Proper TACC3 localization is dependent on Aurora A–
mediated phosphorylation of Ser558. To determine whether
phosphorylation of Ser558 is required to target human TACC3 to the
mitotic spindle, the localization of exogenously expressed EGFPWT TACC3 (wild-type, full-length TACC3 fused to NH2-terminal
EGFP) and EGFP-MUT TACC3 (Ser558Ala, full-length TACC3 fused
to NH2-terminal EGFP) were compared in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 2A).
Western blots showed that EGFP-WT TACC3 and EGFP-MUT
TACC3 clones expressed equal levels of protein (Fig. 2B). EGFP-WT
TACC3 localized primarily to mitotic spindles in prometaphase/
metaphase cells, whereas EGFP-MUT TACC3 did not fully localize
to apparent mitotic spindles and displayed a diffuse staining
throughout mitotic cells. Aurora A inhibition with the selective
small molecule inhibitor MLN8054 resulted in EGFP-WT TACC3
redistribution away from the mitotic spindle, mirroring the
localization of EGFP-MUT TACC3. Previous studies showed that
Aurora A inhibition with MLN8054 allowed for the formation of a
mitotic spindle, albeit abnormal (24). We infer from these findings
that complete TACC3 localization to the mitotic spindle is
dependent on Ser558 phosphorylation by Aurora A.
Localization of endogenous TACC3 was also evaluated in HCT116 cells treated with 1 Amol/L MLN8054 for 4 h followed by
bortezomib for the last 2 h before fixation to trap mitotic cells
immediately before anaphase onset. This allowed for the observation of MLN8054 treated and untreated cells at a similar stage of
mitosis. Cells were fixed and stained for mitotic spindles,
centrosomes, and spindle poles using antibodies directed against
a-tubulin, Aurora A, and NuMA, respectively (Fig. 3). Similar to the
EGFP-WT TACC3 overexpressing clones, TACC3 did not fully
localize to mitotic spindles in the presence of MLN8054 and
displayed a diffuse staining throughout mitotic cells, even when a
bipolar spindle formed (Fig. 3A). Typically, MLN8054 results in
abnormal mitotic spindle formation accompanied by chromosome
congression defects (24). TACC3 localizes to centrosomes and
proximal mitotic spindles (33); therefore, colocalization with the

was examined (Fig. 3B and C, respectively). Although both Aurora
A and NuMA were properly localized in these cells, there was no
significant colocalization with TACC3 in cells treated with

MLN8054. To ensure that Aurora A activity was inhibited in these
cells, autophosphorylation on Thr288 (pThr288) was assessed
(Fig. 3D). DMSO-treated HCT-116 cells exhibited detectable pThr288,
which colocalized with total Aurora A. In MLN8054-treated cells,

using the same intensity scale.

Aurora A localization) in treated samples relative to the DMSO-treated controls. Points, averages of three replicate samples; bars, SD. Bisecting lines in reflect

numbers represent the average IC50 F SD derived from multiple experiments, indicated by the number in parentheses. D, comparison of IC50s for six inhibitors,
including MLN8054, MLN8054-related compounds sharing the benzezapine core scaffold, VX-680, and ZM447439, generated in the TACC3 localization assay and in
the Aurora A pThr288 autophosphorylation assay. The correlation coefficient (P) is shown.

pThr288 was not detected, although total Aurora A remained,
showing that Aurora A activity was inhibited in these cells. These
results show that proper localization of endogenous TACC3 during
mitosis is dependent on Aurora A activity.
MLN8054 mislocalizes TACC3 away from centrosomes in a
concentration-dependent manner. TACC3 localization was
quantified by measuring TACC3 immunofluorescent intensity in
Aurora A–positive HCT-116 and HT29 mitotic cells treated with
MLN8054 (Fig. 4). In control treated samples, TACC3 robustly
localized to distinct poles in both cell lines as indicated by the
TACC3 intensity maps. However, MLN8054 caused TACC3 to be
diffusely localized throughout mitotic cells. As MLN8054 leads to a
mitotic spindle defects (24), other inhibitors that affect mitotic
spindle formation independent of Aurora A activity were also
examined. These included monastrol and paclitaxel. Although both
inhibitors resulted in spindle defects, TACC3 localization remained
focused within mitotic cells.
A cell-based assay was developed to quantify TACC3 localization
to Aurora A–positive spots within HCT-116 and HT29 mitotic cells
treated with various concentrations of MLN8054, paclitaxel, and
monastrol (Fig. 5). TACC3 immunofluorescent intensity was
measured by automated fluorescent microscopy and was quantified using ProGuru image analysis software. MLN8054 inhibited

TACC3 localization with an IC50 of 0.076 F 0.040 Amol/L in HCT116 cells and 0.137 F 0.020 Amol/L in HT29 cells. Neither paclitaxel
nor monastrol sufficiently inhibited TACC3 localization to achieve
an IC50 value in either cell line. In fact, increasing concentrations of
paclitaxel amplified TACC3 localization to Aurora A–positive spots
in mitotic cells in both cell lines. Monastrol slightly diminished
TACC3 localization to Aurora A–positive spots, although not
sufficiently to generate IC50 values.
To determine how well TACC3 mislocalization predicted Aurora A
activity, IC50 values for six inhibitors generated in the TACC3
localization assay were compared with those generated in the
Aurora A pThr288 autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 5D). This latter
assay quantifies the immunofluorescent intensity of Aurora A
pThr288 as a measure of kinase activity (24). There was a strong
correlation between IC50 values generated between these two assays
for inhibitors of different structural classes. These included
MLN8054; three MLN8054-related molecules sharing the benzazepine core scaffold (24); VX-680, a dual Aurora A and Aurora B
inhibitor (34); and ZM447439, an Aurora B selective inhibitor (35, 36).
Collectively, these experiments suggest that TACC3 localization
can be used to measure Aurora A activity in mitotic cells.

TACC3 from centrosomes presents a potential for use as a
pharmacodynamic marker of Aurora A activity in vivo. To assess
this possibility, nude mice bearing HCT-116 tumor xenografts were
treated with a single oral dose of MLN8054 at 3, 10, 30, or 60 mg/kg,
and tumors were collected 8 h later. Tumor sections were costained
for TACC3, NuMA, and DNA (Fig. 6A). In vehicle-treated samples,
NuMA localized to opposing spindle poles, and TACC3 localized to
the mitotic spindle. A similar localization was found in metaphase
cells from tumors treated with 3 and 10 mg/kg MLN8054. However,
with higher doses of MLN8054 (30 and 60 mg/kg), TACC3 was not
readily apparent in metaphase cells. Localization of TACC3 to

NuMA-positive mitotic cells was quantified in each dose group
(Fig. 6B). MLN8054 at 3 and 10 mg/kg induced a slight decrease in
properly localized TACC3 in NuMA-positive mitotic cells, although
this difference did not achieve statistical significance. However,
MLN8054 at 30 and 60 mg/kg caused a robust decrease in spindlefocused TACC3. The dose-dependent loss of TACC3 at spindle
poles paralleled the loss of Aurora A autophosphorylation on
Thr288, indicating that TACC3 mislocalization directly reflects
decreased Aurora A activity in tumors (Fig. 6C). Moreover, the
dose-dependent loss of TACC3 at spindle poles correlated with
previous observations from a separate efficacy study showing a

partial tumor growth inhibition with 3 or 10 mg/kg once a day oral
dose of MLN8054 for 21 days and a maximal tumor growth
inhibition with a 30 mg/kg oral dose of MLN8054 (24). Collectively,
these results suggest that loss of mitotic spindle-focused TACC3
can be used as a pharmacodynamic measure of Aurora A activity
in vivo.

Discussion
The Aurora-related kinases have generated significant interest
as potential targets for anticancer therapeutic intervention.
Towards this end, Millennium Pharmaceuticals developed a
selective small molecule Aurora A inhibitor (MLN8054) that
entered clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers. In this
work, we propose a novel pharmacodynamic method for measuring Aurora A activity in tumors by quantifying TACC3
localization to mitotic spindles. We show that human Aurora A
phosphorylates TACC3 on Ser558, and that this phosphorylation is
required for TACC3 localization to mitotic spindles. Inactivation of
Aurora A in cells using MLN8054 disrupts TACC3 localization to
centrosomes in a concentration-dependent manner. In human
tumor xenografts, MLN8054 also caused a dose-dependent
mislocalization of TACC3 away from spindle poles. As TACC3
localization to mitotic spindles is strictly dependent on Aurora A
activity, proper TACC3 localization will likely be a useful
pharmacodynamic marker in tumors from cancer patients treated
with inhibitors of Aurora A kinase.
Ser34, Ser552, and Ser558 of human TACC3 loosely fit within the
predicted Aurora A phosphorylation consensus site [KR]X[TS][ILV]
(37). These residues are conserved in the Xenopus TACC3
orthologue Maskin (Ser33, Ser620, and Ser626), whereas only Ser558
is obviously conserved in the Drosophila TACC3 orthologue DTACC (Ser863). Using GST-DTACC3 as a substrate in an in vitro
kinase assay, Ser399, Ser402, and Ser558 were identified as potential
Aurora A phosphorylated residues by LC-MS/MS phosphomapping.
Of these, only Ser558 was confirmed to be phosphorylated using
various combinations of serine to alanine mutations for each of
these residues in GST-DTACC3. The conserved Ser558 sites on
Xenopus Maskin (Ser626) and Drosophila D-TACC (Ser863) were also
previously shown to be phosphorylated by Aurora A (16–18).
However, in Xenopus, Aurora A also phosphorylated Maskin on
Ser33 and Ser620 (17, 18), whereas in our system, Ser552 was not
phosphorylated by Aurora A, and Ser34 was not present on the
GST-DTACC3 substrate.
Localization of TACC proteins to centrosomes has been shown
in several models to be dependent on Aurora A activity (16–20).
For example, knockdown of Aurora A by RNAi or immunodepletion in C. elegans embryos, Xenopus egg extracts, or Drosophila
cultured neuroblasts mislocalized TAC-1, Maskin, and D-TACC,
respectively, away from centrosomes (18–20). Moreover, in
Drosophila embryos, GFP-conjugated wild-type D-TACC localized
to centrosomes more intensely than did a Ser863 to a leucine
mutant protein (16). These results are consistent with our findings
showing that exogenously expressed EGFP-MUT TACC3 did not
fully localize to the mitotic spindle relative to EGFP-WT TACC3.
Interestingly, we found that inhibition of Aurora A with MLN8054
mislocalized EGFP-WT TACC3 away from mitotic spindles to a
degree similar to that of untreated EGFP-MUT TACC3. These
results indicate that Ser558 is likely the predominant site of TACC3
that requires phosphorylation by Aurora A for mitotic spindle
localization in human cells.

To determine if TACC3 mislocalization could be used to measure
inhibition of Aurora A activity, a cell-based TACC3 localization
assay was developed to quantify TACC3 localization to centrosomes. Treatment of two colon tumor cell lines with MLN8054
resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in TACC3 at
centrosomes. Moreover, there was a striking correlation in
calculated IC50s between the TACC3 localization assay and the
Aurora A pThr288 autophosphorylation assay for several classes of
Aurora inhibitors, indicating that proper TACC3 localization can in
fact be used as a measure of Aurora A activity. This effect was not
related to general spindle formation defects resulting from Aurora
A inhibition, as treatment with other microtubule disrupters,
including paclitaxel and monastrol, did not significantly decrease
TACC3 localization to centrosomes.
Similar to what was found in cultured tumor cells, HCT-116 tumor
xenografts in nude mice also showed a dose-dependent decrease in
TACC3 localization to mitotic spindles. This result was similar to
what was observed with Aurora A pThr288 staining in these samples.
However, pThr288 staining is often faint and more subject to
nonspecific staining in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.
Furthermore, Aurora A predominantly localizes to centrosomes, and
these small structures are often absent from the plane of section.
Therefore, we deem TACC3 mislocalization from the mitotic spindle
as a more robust and uniform marker of Aurora A activity in tissues.
Previous studies in HCT-116 xenografts showed that tumor
growth inhibition was maximal in nude mice dosed once a day
with a 30 mg/kg oral dose of MLN8054 after 21 days (24). Partial
tumor growth inhibition was attained with 3 and 10 mg/kg daily
oral dosing of MLN8054. These results are consistent with findings
here showing a partial decrease in the percent of spindle localized
TACC3 8 h after a 3 and 10 mg/kg oral dose of MLN8054 and a
maximal decrease after a 30 mg/kg oral dose. This suggests that the
TACC3 mislocalization has potential in predicting outcome in
cancer patients treated with MLN8054. Further studies are needed
to confirm this hypothesis.
Clinical development of anticancer drugs can be greatly
facilitated by implementation of both pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic methods that accurately predict clinical outcome. Appropriate measures of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship in clinical trials provide several advantages,
including demonstration of target inhibition, selection of optimal
drug dose that maximizes on target efficacy while minimizing off
target toxicities, prediction of clinical outcome, and acceleration of
the approval process, thereby decreasing the overall cost of drug
approval (38). To date, there have been no reports of direct
pharmacodynamic markers for measuring Aurora A inhibition.
In this report, we show that mislocalization of TACC3 away from
mitotic spindles can be used as a robust direct measure of Aurora
A activity in tumors. This method should facilitate the clinical
advancement of MLN8054 and future Aurora A inhibitors that
enter anticancer clinical trials.
