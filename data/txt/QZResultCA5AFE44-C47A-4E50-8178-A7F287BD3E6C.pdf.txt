Abstract
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), strongly associated pathogenic markers of cancer, have undergone
extensive drug development programs. Marimastat, a noncovalent MMP inhibitor, was conjugated with FITC
to label cellular metalloproteinase cancer targets in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. Punctate localization of active
transmembrane MMP14 was observed. For molecular-targeted positron emission tomography imaging of syngeneic 67NR murine mammary carcinoma in vivo, marimastat was 18F-labeled using a shelf-stable arylboronic
ester conjugate as a captor for aqueous [18F]fluoride in a novel, rapid one-step reaction at ambient temperature. [18F]Marimastat-aryltrifluoroborate localized to the tumors, with labeling being blocked in control
animals first loaded with >10-fold excess unlabeled marimastat. The labeled drug cleared primarily via
the hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal tract, with multiple animals imaged in independent experiments,
confirming the ease of this new labeling strategy. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7562–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction

target specificity (1). Hence, cancer-specific small molecule
F-labeled radiotracers are urgently needed.
Rapid on-site production of bioactive specific molecular
imaging agents is hampered by 18F labeling methodologies
that traditionally have relied on C–F bond formation under
conditions that are generally incompatible with biomolecule
stability, such as scrupulously dry organic solvents at 70°C to
140°C. Overcoming these obstacles is plagued by relatively
time-consuming multistep syntheses that are further complicated by side reactions requiring extensive purification. Coupled with the short half-life of 18F (110 min), these problems
reduce specific activity and the imaging time window.
Recently, Ting and colleagues (2) used arylboronate precursors to capture aqueous [18F]fluoride in the form of an aryltrifluoroborate (ArBF3) for 18F-labeling in a rapid, one-step
synthesis under acidic aqueous conditions at room temperature. Indeed, the [18F]aryltrifluoroborate was stable in vivo
because no [18F]fluoride accumulation was detected in bone,
a highly fluorophilic tissue (3). Such chemistries have the
potential to fast-track the introduction of 18F-labeled bioconjugates in “kit” form7 for diagnostic imaging in humans.
To validate this novel labeling method for cancer imaging,
we hypothesized that an optimal target would be highly
expressed in many tumors, show discrimination between different cancer stages, and be targeted by nanomolar inhibitor
drugs with clinically demonstrated safety. These criteria are
met by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that are expressed
18

Positron emission tomography (PET) for molecular
imaging is one of the most powerful noninvasive imaging
technologies for the production of high-resolution, threedimensional images within deep tissue needed for human
clinical application (1). Fluorine-18 (18F) is the optimal PET
radioisotope because of its short half-life leading to favorable
radiometric dosimetry, its high sensitivity, and the ability to
quantify tissue distribution of conjugated compounds. Indeed, [18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is the most widely used
radiotracer for cancer diagnostics despite a relative lack of

and activated in most cancers and their peritumor stroma
(4, 5). With many MMP inhibitor drug candidates reaching
phase III clinical trials, their failure has nevertheless been
disappointing (4, 6). Marimastat, a nanomolar hydroxamate
peptidic broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (7) with activity
against related MMPs, such as the ADAMs and ADAMTSs
that are also often associated with cancer (4, 5), is a noncovalent and thereby reversible inhibitor, and thus has reduced
potential for tissue accumulation and unwanted irreversible
side reactions in short-term imaging applications. In late
phase III clinical trials involving thousands of patients with
advanced cancer, including breast carcinoma trials, marimastat proved to be safe, although some patients reported
musculoskeletal pain (7). Hence, we selected marimastat as
a scaffold onto which a boronic acid could be grafted for
aqueous [18F]fluoride capture so as to develop a noninvasive,
clinically safe radiotracer for the in vivo imaging of cancer
by detection of elevated MMP levels. We present the first
one-step radiolabeling for in vivo application of a moleculartargeted [18F]-PET probe for cancer detection and show high
specificity labeling of mammary carcinomas in mice.

Chemical synthesis
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros
Organics. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Analytic and preparative TLC
were performed using Silica Gel 60 F254 Glass TLC plates from
EMD Chemicals. All 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 or 400 MHz
instrument. Chemical shifts are reported using the δ scale in
ppm and all coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz).
Unless specified, 1H-NMR spectra are referenced to the tetramethylsilane peak (δ = 0.00) and 19 F-NMR spectra are
referenced to NEAT trifluoroacetic acid (δ = 0.00, −78.3 ppm
relative to CFCl3). Due to the presence of 19F contaminations
in the NMR spectrometer probe, baseline corrections for samples <20 mmol/L in 19F concentration had to be adjusted by
multipoint linear baseline correction using MestReC 4.9.9.9.
This correction did not affect the absolute chemical shifts or
integration ratios of 19F signals.
Final synthesis of compounds illustrated in Fig. 2A is
described below. Synthesis of precursor compounds is fully
detailed in Supplementary Materials and Methods (Note:
if not specifically indicated, compound numbers refer to
Supplementary Schemes 1 to 4).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were kindly provided
by Dr. V.C. Jordan (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) in
2002. Stable MMP14 transfectants were established and characterized by us as described previously (8, 9). The murine
breast cancer cell line, 67NR (10), was kindly provided by
Dr. Fred Miller (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI) in
July 2008. The cell line was authenticated for growth in vitro
and in vivo as described by us previously (11).
Syngeneic tumor model
Female BALB/c mice (7–9 weeks old; Taconic Laboratories)
were injected with 1 × 106 viable 67NR/CMV-Luciferase murine mammary cancer cells into the right fourth mammary
gland (50 μL in PBS per mouse; ref. 11).
Microarray analysis
Primary syngeneic 67NR tumor tissues and control mammary glands were dissected by laser capture microdissection
(11). Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen)
and re-extracted and resuspended in 10 μL of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA was quantified and qualified
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA probes were labeled
and hybridized to the CLIP-CHIPTM (12), a dedicated murine
protease and inhibitor DNA microarray. Data were analyzed
using the R Bioconductor package with CARMAweb 1.3
front-end. Spot intensities were background-corrected using
the “normexp” method and data normalized within and
between arrays by applying print-tip loess and quantile
normalization, respectively (12). For statistical analysis, moderated t statistics (Bioconductor “limma” package) were used
and P values calculated using Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing.

Brij 35 using a 320-nm excitation filter and a 405-nm emission
filter in the presence of increasing inhibitor concentrations.
Curve-fitting and IC50 calculations were done using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 Software (GraphPad Software).
Marimastat-FITC as a MMP activity–based probe
Recombinant human MMP2, 8, 9, 13, and 14 (also known
as membrane type 1-MMP) were expressed and purified.
4-Aminophenylmercuric acetate–activated MMPs were
resolved nonreduced on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. SDS was
removed using Triton X-100 washes and renatured proteins
in the gels were incubated overnight with 1 μmol/L of
marimastat-FITC in 100 mmol/L Tris, 30 mmol/L CaCl2
(pH 8), 37°C. After washing three times (10 min) with PBS
and imaging the gels using a 340-nm excitation filter on an
Alpha Imager system (Alpha Innotech), they were stained
with Coomassie brilliant blue R250. For assessing active
MMPs in primary 67NR mammary tumors (11) and control
mammary gland, the tissues were homogenized in 100 mmol/L
of Tris, 30 mmol/L of CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35 (pH 8). Extracts were
clarified (14,000 × g) and 100 μg of total protein in supernatants were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and processed
for marimastat-FITC imaging.
Marimastat-FITC visualization of MMP14 in cell culture
MDA-MB-231 stably transfected with human MMP14 (with
a FLAG-tag in the juxtamembrane stalk) or empty vector (8)
were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum with G418
selection (Geneticin, 1 mg/mL; Life Technologies, Invitrogen
Canada). For MMP14 activity-staining, the cells were grown
on glass chamber slides and incubated with 20 μmol/L of
marimastat-FITC in culture medium for 12 hours. The cells
were then washed twice with PBS, counterstained with
Hoechst (0.1 mg/mL in PBS, 20 min, at 25°C), and fixed for
20 minutes with 4% formalin. The slides were washed two
times with PBS, mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) and imaged using a Leica
DMRA2 fluorescence microscope. Pictures were taken
with a 100× oil immersion objective with the same exposure
time and digital gain for MMP14-transfected and vector
control cells.
PET imaging of tumors in vivo
Day 25 67NR tumors were imaged by in vivo bioluminescence on a cryogenically cooled IVIS system (Xenogen Corporation) using Living Imaging acquisition and Living Image
2.50.1 software analysis (11). One day after IVIS imaging (day
26 or 33) control 67NR tumor mice were injected i.p. with
blocking solution [300 nmol marimastat (1) in PBS], three
times over 60 minutes prior to tracer injection. Pre-blocked
and unblocked mice were then anesthetized with isoflurane
(5% induction, 1.5% maintenance), and injected (tail vein)

with 50 to 100 μCi 18F-labeled marimastat-ArBF3 (5; decaycorrected specific activity of 0.185 Ci/μmol or 0.39 Ci/μmol
at the time of injections) or 440 μCi control-ArBF3 (Supplementary data, 15) prepared as described in Supplementary
data and Li and colleagues.7 Five minutes later, animals underwent an 80-minute dynamic scan followed by a 10-minute
transmission scan using a microPET Focus 120 (CTI Concorde) system. Groups of mice were imaged with 18F-labeled
marimastat-ArBF3 on three separate occasions with or without prior blocking with the underivatized marimastat. PET
data were compiled with Siemens Focus 120 microPET software. PET images and time–activity curves were generated
with Amide version 0.8.19.

Results
MMP expression patterns differed between mammary
control tissues (n = 3) and tumors (n = 3; Fig. 1) where transcripts of MMP7, 13, 14, and 24 were statistically significantly
elevated (P < 0.05), but others were reduced compared with
normal tissue including MMP2, 15, 23, 25, and 27. Hence,
67NR tumor-expressed MMPs were probed with marimastat
conjugates.
Marimastat (1; Fig. 2A) was synthesized as a reference for
inhibitory activity of imaging derivatives. We then synthesized
a highly versatile derivative precursor by the addition of a linker

arm at the P3′ site, which is known not to interfere with potency or specificity (ref. 14; marimastat-linker, 2). This was used as
an attachment point for generating a fluorescent imaging
probe (marimastat-FITC, 3) and a shelf-stable marimastatarylboronic ester conjugate (marimastat-boronate, 4). For
PET imaging, marimastat-boronate(4) is converted in a
single step to marimastat-ArBF3 (5) under aqueous conditions at ambient temperature (18°C) and isolated in radiochemically pure form as described in Li and colleagues.7
With an IC50 of 2.10 nmol/L (Fig. 2B) and in good agreement with original reports (7), marimastat (1), was a

Marimastat-ArBF3 (5) showed the same IC50 (1.67 nmol/L),

(Fig. 2B). Following SDS-PAGE marimastat-FITC (3) specifically labeled activated MMP2, 9, 13, and 14 despite stringent
washes (Fig. 3A and B) alleviating a concern that its dissociation rate might interfere with planned MMP detection in vivo.
Neither the molecular weight markers nor the autolytically
cleaved hemopexin domain of MMP13 showed labeling, confirming active site specificity. Notably, similar analysis of murine tissue lysates with marimastat-FITC (3) revealed MMP
activity in the tumors (n = 2) greatly exceeding that observed
in control mammary gland tissue (n = 2; Fig. 3B).
We next established in vitro imaging efficacy. Human
MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells stably expressing
MMP14, a transmembrane protease highly expressed in
cancer that activates proMMP2, but not vector transfectant
controls were specifically labeled with marimastat-FITC
(3; Fig. 3C). The punctate localization of MMP14 on the plasma membrane correlates with immunofluorescence studies
or when GFP-MMP14 was expressed in the same cells (16).
Primary tumors were imaged over 25 days by luciferase
bioluminescence (Fig. 4A, left). For PET molecular imaging of
MMPs in vivo, separate radiosyntheses of marimastat-ArBF3 (5)
were performed that afforded ∼1 mCi of 5 with respective specific activities of 0.185 Ci/μmol for imaging on day 26 and 0.39
Ci/μmol for imaging on day 33. Sixty minutes after the injection
of tumor-bearing mice with 50 to 100 μCi of marimastat-ArBF3
(5), we observed low but detectable and specific uptake in the
primary tumor, whereas in mice injected with 440 μCi controlArBF3 (Supplementary data, 15) lacking the marimastat moiety
no tumor localization was observed, with clearance only to the
liver, bladder, and submaxillary salivary gland (Fig. 4A). As a
further specificity control, we preblocked tumor-bearing mice
with 300 nmol of unlabeled marimastat (1) prior to the tracer
injection. The preblocked mice had clearly reduced activity in
the same region as the littermates with similarly sized tumors

(Fig. 4B and C). A small amount of bone uptake was seen due to
the presence of ∼3% to 5% free [18F]fluoride that may have coeluted with the sample during the chromatographic separation
and/or possibly solvolyzed on standing. Time–activity curve
analysis revealed that marimastat-ArBF3 (5) accumulated in
the tumor at 60 minutes (Fig. 4D). Overall, the PET imaging
and time–activity curve analyses show specific 18F-labeling of
the tumor as well as of bladder, liver, stomach, and gut to
which the compound cleared (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Discussion
The use of a noncovalent nanomolar protease inhibitor
drug as a model bioconjugate shows the ease and broad
applicability of this novel labeling technique for in vivo cancer imaging. Previously, metalloproteinase activity has been
imaged in mouse models of cancer by fluorescent detection
of cleaved peptides quenched with near-IR fluorochromes,
but this approach suffers from low tissue penetrance and
does not afford deep tissue localization (17).
In contrast, using small molecule drugs offers improved
pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in solid tumors. For
some serine and cysteine proteases, covalent inhibitors for
imaging can be used (18), but for metalloproteinases, only
noncovalent inhibitors are available for in vivo application.
Nonetheless, this approach has advantages including reduced probe accumulation in tissues that can lead to unwanted side reactions. Together with rapid clearance, this
also circumvents the long time intervals needed to reduce
background from unincorporated covalent probes in tissues
before imaging.
Although [11C]methylation represents an attractive onestep labeling method, it can suffer from nonspecific methylation side reactions. Furthermore, the 20-minute half-life for

In vivo PET Imaging of Proteases in Cancer

Figure 4. In vivo PET imaging of MMPs in murine breast carcinomas. A, IVIS image of 67NR/CMV-Luciferase derived primary tumor (left) is from the
same mouse imaged next day by MicroPET with 50 μCi of marimastat-ArBF3 (middle). Control mouse injected with 440 μCi control-ArBF3 (right). Pictures
were reconstructed from a scan taken 50 to 80 min after tracer injection. B, MicroPET images of 67NR breast tumor mice with 100 μCi of marimastat-ArBF3
(5) injected either in an unblocked tumor mouse (left) or in a tumor mouse preblocked with 300 nmol of marimastat (right). C, biological replicate of
B using tumors established on different dates and imaged on different days. D, time–activity curves of the primary tumor of unblocked and preblocked
marimastat-ArBF3 (5) injected 67NR mice, respectively.

C-11 dramatically reduces the imaging time window (19),
therefore reducing image quality compared with ligands labeled with other PET isotopes (20). Our labeling technique
captures the advantages of a single-step labeling in the case
of F-18 to afford ligands with specific activities that are
potentially useful for imaging.7
As this approach is conceptually very different from other
radiolabeling methods, it is essential to briefly address some
of the chemical attributes of an 18F-labeled ArBF3. The first is
the question of chemical purity. Although labeling must proceed through mono- and difluoronated intermediates en
route to the labeled ArBF3, the mono- and difluoroboranes/
boronates are unstable at pH 7 (21), and as such, the ArBF3 is
the only labeled species isolated. The second concern relates
to specific activity. Although high specific activity is always

preferable, there is no universally accepted value as to what
minimal specific activity represents a threshold of utility and
often a value of ∼1 Ci/μmol is sufficient for imaging. Traditionally, radiosyntheses are performed under no carrier–
added conditions to guarantee the highest possible specific
activities. A prevailing misconception in such work is that
no carrier–added fluoride has a specific activity close to that
of carrier-free, that is, 1,720 Ci/μmol; in practice, however,
the specific activity of “no carrier–added” [18F]fluoride generally falls in the range of 3 to 10 Ci/μmol. As such, there is a
significant amount of carrier [19F]fluoride present in all no
carrier–added syntheses. Furthermore, the decay that accompanies multistep radiosyntheses of mid-size molecules
further reduces the final specific activities, which commonly
fall in the range of 1 to 2 Ci/μmol, or less. Because three fluoride ions condense with one arylboronate to give an ArBF3,
the law of mass action ensures that the resulting ArBF3 has a
decay-corrected specific activity that is thrice that of the
source fluoride; therefore, activities as high as 30 Ci/μmol
may be envisaged if no carrier–added fluoride with a specific

activity of 10 Ci/μmol is used. Nevertheless, yields may be low
unless reaction volume is minimized; the use of 500 mCi of no
carrier–added fluoride with a specific activity of 10 Ci/μmol
represents 50 nmol total [18/19F]fluoride, which if contained
in 1 μL, would provide a 50 mmol/L fluoride solution that
is high enough to afford reasonable yields in terms of an
ArBF3. Finally, because of the relatively high presence of carrier [19F]fluoride that are present, even under no carrier–
added conditions, statistically the labeled ArBF3 will contain
only one atom of [18F]fluoride (3, 21).
Despite a relatively low signal to noise ratio, tumor-labeling
was specific as shown from the unlabeled blocking control
studies. Notably, image quality did not improve with higher
specific activity probes; tumor images were similar irrespective of whether the specific activity of marimastat-ArBF3 (5)
was 0.185 Ci/μmol (Fig. 4B) or 0.39 Ci/μmol (Fig. 4C),
corresponding to ∼12 nmol/L or ∼27 nmol/L in vivo. Because
the respective concentrations of 5 were 3.5× and 10× the Kd,
this suggests, but does not prove that even higher specific
activities would not improve imaging quality. Although a
slightly better image was recorded with higher specific activity
(Fig. 4C), this improvement is ascribed to larger tumor size, as
tumors on day 33 (Fig. 4C) were twice as large as those imaged
on day 26 (Fig. 4B).
It has to be noted that previous studies using 18F-conjugated
MMP inhibitors for in vivo imaging also revealed high uptake
of tracer in tissues with known nonpathologic MMP expression such as the liver (22, 23). Blood also contains MMPs. This
is a particular problem for broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors
and leads to poor target/nontarget contrasts when imaging
disease tissues. With more data becoming available on the expression and activity of specific MMPs in particular pathologies, antibodies or small molecule inhibitors with narrow
specificity can be developed and modified for the rapid conversion to 18F-conjugated radiotracers using our novel onestep labeling chemistry. A promising target for this strategy
is MMP13, which is highly expressed in human breast cancer
(24), and for that, specific inhibitors are currently in active
development (25).
Although the metabolic fate of marimastat-ArBF3 (5) is unknown, we measured the inhibitory activity in the urine postmortem; the observed IC 50 value per microcurie was
comparable to that injected suggesting that 5 was not being
metabolized and clears to the urine intact (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Notably, the ArBF3 control that is not appended to
marimastat does not clear to the gut (Fig. 4A). This illustrates
that clearance is at least partially governed by the marimastat moiety and points to potential clinical applications

in the gastrointestinal tract, which experience high drug
exposures.
The in vivo application of [18F]marimastat-aryltrifluoroborate
represents a key development in PET imaging as we have
reduced to practice the production of a shelf-stable bioconjugate that can be rapidly labeled with [18F]fluoride for PET
imaging in a simple one-step aqueous reaction at ambient
temperatures under mild conditions. The key to this advance
in PET imaging is the synthesis of stable [18F]aryltrifluoroborates as viable alternatives to [18F]organofluorides. The
use of a stable arylboronic acid as a captor of aqueous
[18F]fluoride avoids tedious multistep syntheses or harsh
fluorination conditions. These findings should encourage
the widespread development of new molecularly targeted
18
F-labeled peptidic and small molecule drugs for in vivo
imaging. Hence, the first in vivo imaging of tumor metalloproteinases using marimastat as a scaffold indicates that
labeling of other ligands is a facile approach for targeted
PET imaging for human diagnosis as well as drug target
validation, tissue targeting, and compound clearance to aid
drug development.
