BACKGROUND. To the authors’ knowledge, liver damage after liver radioembolization with yttrium90-labeled microspheres has never been studied specifically.

METHODS. Using a complete set of data recorded prospectively among all
patients without previous chronic liver disease treated by radioembolization at
the authors’ institution from September 2003 to July 2006, patterns of liver
damage were identified and possible risk factors were analyzed.

RESULTS. In all, 20% of patients developed a distinct clinical picture that
appeared 4 to 8 weeks after treatment and was characterized by jaundice and ascites. Veno-occlusive disease was the histologic hallmark observed in the most
severe cases. This form of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was not observed
among patients who never received chemotherapy or in those in whom a single
hepatic lobe was treated. Relevant to treatment planning, a possible risk factor
was a higher treatment dose in relation to the targeted liver volume. A transjugu-

adioembolization (RE) is a form of brachytherapy in which
radiation is delivered by radioactive isotopes labeled in microspheres that are injected into the arteries that feed the tumors.1
Liver RE has been shown to produce significant rates of tumor
growth control among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC)2–7 and liver metastases from other tumors, particularly colorectal cancer.8–17 After injection, microspheres are embolized in the
tumor microvasculature in a larger proportion than in the nontumoral parenchyma. Although the clinical impact of damage caused
by yttrium90 (90Y)-microspheres that do not reach the tumors is
purportedly low, to our knowledge the information available in the
literature regarding liver toxicity after RE is obscure and sometimes
confusing. We analyzed liver damage occurring after RE among
patients without previous chronic liver disease using a set of data
recorded prospectively. Herein we describe the incidence, patterns,
outcome, and possible risk factors of a clinical picture that is consistent with the definition of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.18

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From September 2003 to July 2006, 100 patients with
liver tumors were evaluated for RE at our institution.
Treatment was contraindicated in 20 patients and 35
patients were excluded from analysis, 28 because
they had primary liver tumors with concurrent
chronic liver disease (either confirmed histologically,
or suspected because of clinical and imaging data),
and 7 because of deficient follow-up. Therefore, the
occurrence of liver damage was studied in 45
patients without chronic liver disease who underwent liver RE. Clinical and analytical data were
recorded prospectively for all treated patients.

Treatment and Follow-up
Pretreatment evaluation and patient selection
RE was considered for those patients with liver
tumors that could not be treated by surgical or percutaneous ablation, had already received standard
therapy if available, had a good functional status
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score
of 0–2), and had a histologic diagnosis of malignancy.
Although most patients had isolated liver cancer,
some had extrahepatic disease that was considered
either under control or not likely to influence prognosis (eg, abdominal lymph node). The majority of
patients had been previously treated with 2 or 3 lines
of chemotherapy. RE was contraindicated in the presence of severe hypersplenism (neutrophil count <1.5/
pL or platelet count <45/pL), altered liver function
(bilirubin >3 mg/dL, or ascites), altered renal function (creatinine >2 mg/dL), or any contraindication
to angiography.
Our protocol for RE of liver tumors has been
explained in detail elsewhere7 and can be summarized as follows. After signing an informed consent,
patients were studied within the 4-week period
before treatment by means of: 1) an angiogram, to
detect possible variants of arterial liver irrigation,
identify the vessels that provide arterial blood supply
to every liver tumor nodule, and assess portal vein
blood flow; 2) a scintigraphy using macroaggregates
of technetium-99m labeled human serum albumin
(MAA) to measure the degree of shunt to the lung,
predict any possible misplacement of microspheres
in the gastrointestinal tract, and evaluate the relative
distribution of radioactivity between the hepatic
tumors and the nontumoral liver; 3) chest and abdominal dual-phase, spiral computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the volume of the tumor mass to be treated,
and that of the nontumoral liver irrigated by the artery in which the tip of the catheter was to be

1539

placed; and 4) blood tests including complete blood
count, liver function tests, creatinine, albumin, and
prothrombin activity.
During angiography the original vascular anatomy was occasionally altered by occluding either
those vessels with an origin in the hepatic arteries
that supplied extrahepatic organs (to prevent their
irradiation) or those aberrant hepatic vessels originating from nonhepatic arteries (so that flow redistribution might allow targeting all liver nodules from a
single injection of microspheres). Theoretically, this
last procedure may result in an unequal distribution
of the microspheres and an increased risk of liver
toxicity.
Since October 2004, a fusion of the single-photon
emission CT (SPECT) images obtained after MAA
injection and the images of contrast-enhanced MRI
or CT studies was obtained for every patient. Patients
were denied RE whenever the activity uptake
observed in tumor lesions was very poor in comparison with nontumoral areas because we believed this
could reflect an increased risk of liver damage
because of radiation.

Treatment procedure and follow-up
All patients were treated with SIR-Spheres (Sirtex
Medical Europe, Bonn, Germany), an implantable
medical device consisting of resin microspheres labeled with 90Y. Two methods were used to calculate
the activity of 90Y to be administered as explained
elsewhere.7 In the BSA Method, activity depends on
the body surface area (BSA) and the extent of tumor
liver involvement, and in the Partition Model,19 the
maximal activity that remains safe for the lung and
the nontumoral liver is calculated. Although this
model was originally designed for patients with single
or discrete nodules, a modification easily applicable
for those patients with multinodular tumors has been
used as the main method for activity calculation.
On the treatment day the calculated activity of
90Y-microspheres was injected after confirming that
there were no new collateral vessels connecting to the
gastrointestinal tract. Patients then remained in the
hospital overnight and supportive therapy consisted
of a proton pump inhibitor that was prescribed for 4
weeks, and antiemetics and analgesics on demand.
Follow-up schedules after treatment varied
depending on the treatment plan of each patient, but
monthly assessments that included physical examination and blood tests were available. Abdominal
imaging was performed for evaluation of response
with a sequence that differed according to tumor
type and individual treatment plan, although at least
bimonthly assessments are available for all patients.

Selection of Variables and Statistical Analysis
More than 100 pretreatment and posttreatment variables that might have affected the occurrence of liver
damage after RE were analyzed (Table 1). A commercial statistical software package (SPSS for Windows,
version 13.0.1; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) was used for
data analysis. The results are presented as the mean
(standard deviation) for continuous variables with a
normal distribution, and as the median (interquartile
range) for continuous variables with a nonnormal
distribution. To investigate their correlation with the
odds of having liver damage, a univariate analysis
was first performed for all of the aforementioned
variables using a Student t test or Mann-Whitney U
test when testing associations of independent continuous variables, and the chi-square or Fisher exact
test when testing associations of independent categoric variables. Because of the reduced number of
cases, only the most clinically relevant factors among

those statistically significant at the 0.1 level were
then selected for multivariate analysis using multiple
logistic regression. A backward selection procedure,
with a P value < .1 used for retention in the model,
was performed to identify important factors at the
.05 level of statistical significance. The HosmerLemeshow test was used to check the goodness-of-fit
of the model.20 All the tests performed as part of the
univariate and multivariate analysis were 2-sided. A
P value < .5 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

(GBq) but the range varied widely from 0.31 GBq for
a whole-liver treatment in a patient with minimal tumor burden to 3.05 GBq for a right lobe treatment in
a patient with a bulky tumor.

Liver Disease Induced by RE
In the first 60 days after RE, 9 patients developed a
similar clinical picture characterized by jaundice and
ascites in the absence of overt tumor progression or
bile duct dilation. Liver function tests revealed an
increase in total bilirubin >3 mg/dL in all cases, a
more heterogeneous tendency toward rising alkaline
phosphatase and g-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP),
and virtually no changes in transaminases. Among
these patients, baseline and peak values within this
60-day period averaged 1.05 (0.56) mg/dL and 9.85
(9.57) mg/dL, respectively, for total bilirubin, 266.4
(133.4) UI/mL and 527.5 (232.0) UI/mL, respectively,
for alkaline phosphatase, and 187.4 (142.2) UI/mL
and 346.6 (188.6) UI/mL, respectively, for GGTP.
Three patients had a rapid, progressive course, with
bilirubin levels >20 mg/dL and declining liver function. As shown in Figure 1, the liver biopsy of 2 of
these patients showed extensive sinusoidal congestion affecting perivenular areas with focal hepatic atrophy, areas of necrosis around central veins with
fresh thrombosis, and some cholestasis in periportal
areas. These findings were consistent with hepatic
veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and because of the
abating liver function a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) was performed 60 days
and 67 days, respectively, after RE. In both cases,
TIPS placement was followed by an improvement in
liver function. One of the patients had liver metastases from breast cancer and was in radiologic complete response 26 months after RE. The other had
liver metastases from colorectal cancer, and 11 days
after TIPS placement died from sepsis-related multiorgan failure while his liver function was progressively improving. The third patient with intense,
progressive liver dysfunction refused a liver biopsy
and died 75 days after RE. The remaining 6 patients
had a more benign course, as shown in Figure 2. Ascites was easily controlled with diuretics and bilirubin tended to plateau but did not return to normal
values in any case. At the time of last follow-up, all
the patients had died of tumor progression. Two of
them developed hepatic encephalopathy with
increased serum levels of ammonium that responded
to oral lactulose.
Among patients without this distinct picture, a
clinically irrelevant but statistically significant
increase in bilirubin was observed after RE (mean
values: 0.78 mg/dL at baseline and 1.03 mg/dL at

Risk Factors for Liver Disease Induced by RE
When compared with patients who did not, those
who developed RE-induced liver disease (REILD)

were younger (mean age of 45 years vs 56 years;
P < .05), leaner (mean body mass index [BMI] of 23.7
vs 26.0; P < .1), and had received chemotherapy
more frequently (100% vs 66%; P < .05). At the time
of RE they had a lower tumor burden (mean tumor
volume of 190 mL vs 590 mL; P < .1), a higher bilirubin

(mean bilirubin of 1.05 mg/dL vs 0.79 mg/dL;
P < .1), and were more likely to have a flow redistribution procedure performed at angiographic evaluation (44.4% vs 12.5%; P < .05). They did not receive a
higher total activity (mean activity of 1.6 GBq vs 1.76
GBq; P value not significant), but this activity might
have resulted (according to the rough estimation of
the partition model) in a higher dose of radiation
being delivered to the nontumoral liver (mean dose
of 37 grays [Gy] vs 29 Gy; P < .1). Only patients
exposed to chemotherapy developed REILD. As
shown in Table 3, patients who developed REILD
more likely had received oxaliplatin and capecitabine
in the recent past, although none of these differences
were found to be statistically significant. Not surprisingly, all 9 patients with REILD had been treated in a
whole-liver fashion as compared with only 66% of
the patients without liver disease (P < .05). In fact,
on multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, age, bilirubin at baseline, treatment approach (whole-liver
vs lobar), and the amount of activity administered
relative to the total volume treated were found to be
independent risk factors for the development of
REILD. With regard to histology, patients with primary liver cancer did not develop REILD but it
should be noted that virtually none of them had
prior exposure to chemotherapy.
A univariate analysis of the group of patients
undergoing whole-liver RE showed the same risk
profile for developing REILD as in the entire cohort
(Tables 4 and 5). Owing to the low number of cases,
a multivariate analysis was performed after selecting
those variables that were more clinically meaningful
and statistically significant. In the final model, only

FIGURE 3. The intensity of radioembolization-induced liver disease is correlated with the degree of tumor involvement and total liver volume.

Hence, patients in whom the tumor represented
<0.2% of the total liver volume developed a more
severe disease. Second, it was related to the degree of
hepatomegaly. Hence, patients with a total tumor
volume >2 L developed a less severe disease. This
may reflect a limitation of the methods currently used
to calculate the therapeutic activity among the population of patients with very low tumor burden, particularly when affecting a liver that is near normal in size.

DISCUSSION
The low tolerance of the liver to radiation has prevented external irradiation from being used in the
treatment of liver tumors for decades.21 However, an
antitumor effect of liver RE has been clearly shown
in the past few years. Among patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, RE with resin 90Y-

microspheres has been shown to induce tumor
regression in a significant proportion of patients,16
and to improve the results of systemic11,17 and regional9 chemotherapy in small randomized controlled trials. Among patients with HCC, RE with
resin 90Y-microspheres results in significant tumor
growth control,2,7 particularly for highly vascularized
tumors,22 and may be useful in downstaging patients
for surgery.23 However, although RE is generally well
tolerated, it may cause relevant toxic effects including liver injury.
To our knowledge, liver damage after RE has not
been thoroughly studied previously. The majority of
published series, including clinical trials, have used
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov Accessed
June 2007) to evaluate toxicity, but this individual
evaluation of blood tests and symptoms may complicate the detection of a distinct syndrome. In all, 20%
of the patients in the current series developed this
picture of potentially life-threatening liver damage
that we have called REILD. It is characterized by
jaundice and ascites developing 4 to 8 weeks after
treatment, with pathologic changes consistent with
VOD in the most severe cases. REILD should be
placed in the spectrum of the sinusoidal obstruction
syndromes, together with the 2 well-known syndromes of subacute liver damage that appear after
external irradiation24 and also share the pathologic
hallmark of VOD.25 Radiation-induced liver disease
appears after external irradiation of liver tumors and
causes rapid weight gain, ascites, and an elevation in
alkaline phosphatase that is in proportion with that
of other liver enzymes (anicteric ascites). On the contrary, combined modality-induced liver disease
appears after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
(when high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation are used as preparative procedures) and
causes jaundice and weight gain, ascites, and a striking elevation of bilirubin in contrast to mildly elevated
transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. REILD is
much more similar to the latter, and the finding that
REILD was only observed among patients that had
received chemotherapy either before or after RE suggests that both pictures may share a common pathophysiologic pathway. It is interesting to note that the
hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome can also be
caused by chemotherapeutic drugs such as oxaliplatin
without concurrent irradiation.26
We cannot compare the incidence of liver disease in the current series with data from the literature because to our knowledge this clinical entity
after RE has not been specifically described previously. In a retrospective series and in 2 clinical

Radioembolization-Induced Liver Disease/Sangro et al.

trials using resin 90Y-microspheres for the treatment
of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer, 4% to
9%11,13,17 of patients had relevant liver toxicity. However, liver toxicity was reportedly absent in other series.10,15,27 Among patients with mostly HCC treated
with glass 90Y-microspheres, up to 9% may develop
progressive hepatic failure after treatment.3 All in all,
the high incidence of REILD in the current series
might be because of the finding that our patients
with liver metastases had been very heavily pretreated, and in many cases RE was performed immediately after or even during their last course of
chemotherapy.
The amount of activity administered relative to
the liver volume targeted and age were independent
predictors of REILD. However, any conclusion
regarding the usefulness of these variables in defining the prognosis of patients after RE should be tempered because of the reduced sample size. We have
no explanation for the apparently increased susceptibility of younger patients to REILD. VOD is more frequent among very young infants undergoing bone
marrow transplantation but this is a completely different population. Conversely, our results suggest
that activities calculated by current methods are suitable for the majority of patients but may be excessive
for a subset of individuals treated in a whole-liver
fashion. However, only prospective studies can determine whether reducing the activity administered to a
maximum relative to the volume of targeted liver
may result in a reduced incidence of moderate to
severe REILD. When seeking lobar RE, the occurrence
of REILD is not relevant, because by reducing the
targeted liver volume one can even increase the dose
without jeopardizing the outcome in what has been
called ‘‘radiation segmentectomy.’’23,28
In summary, REILD is a complication of liver RE
that can produce significant morbidity, with a potentially life-threatening course in a small proportion of
patients. Clinical features and population analysis
strongly suggest that REILD results from the combined effect of chemotherapy and radiation of the
liver. It may be the result of a particular ‘seed and
soil’ combination, so that only when a sufficient
amount of radiation is delivered to liver tissue primed
by chemotherapy does a hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome appear. However, a merely additive or
synergistic effect of radiation and chemotherapy could
also explain this finding. All patients treated by liver
RE, particularly if a whole-liver approach is indicated,
should be assessed systematically for liver damage
between 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Medical treatment can rely on diuretics and general support in
mild cases, but the use of steroids and defibrotide29,30

warrants investigation for patients with proven VOD
and preventive measures such as low-dose heparin,
ursodeoxicolic acid, and pentoxyfylline should be considered for high-risk patients.18 Although the indication of TIPS in VOD is a matter of debate,31,32 our
results suggest it should be considered for patients
with deteriorating liver function.
