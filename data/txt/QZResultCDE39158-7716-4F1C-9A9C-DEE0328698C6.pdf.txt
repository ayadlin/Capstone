ABSTRACT
Crizotinib has been used to counter MET gene amplification in a number of
different human malignancies. Transient response to crizotinib in MET-amplified
gastric cancer has been reported, but the mechanisms of resistance are not well
studied. Here, we reported a stage IV gastric cancer patient with high levels of
MET amplification. The implementation of crizotinib treatment led to significant
symptomatic improvement in the first 2 months, but was followed by rapid disease
progression. Periodic mutation profiling of patient’s circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
by next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a number of genetic alterations
including re-occurrence of MET amplification, multiple secondary MET mutations,
a dramatic increase of FGFR2 gene relative copy number as well as mutations in
other downstream and bypassing elements, which may collectively related to the
patient’s cancer progression. Our results illustrate the complex and heterogeneous
molecular mechanisms for crizotinib resistance in this patient, and demonstrate the
great potential of ctDNA profiling for treatment decision-making and prognosis in
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

that echoed the mutations found in a contemporaneous
tissue biopsy including MET amplification. Mutation
profiling of serial ctDNA samples throughout the course
of crizotinib treatment uncovered a dramatic change
in the genomic landscape, which could be responsible
for rapid development of drug resistance and disease
progression.

MET amplification is reported to occur in
approximately 5% of gastric cancer patients, and targeted
drug crizotinib is currently undergoing a clinical trial of
advanced MET-positive gastric cancer (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT02435108) [1, 2]. Furthermore,
administration of crizotinib to a small cohort of
esophagogastric cancer patients with MET amplification
resulted in initial tumor shrinkage; however, cancer
progression occurred within months and the mechanisms
for drug resistance were not elucidated [2]. Here, we
conducted targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) on
the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of a stage IV gastric
cancer patient, and identified a reservoir of mutations

RESULTS
Our subject was a 32-year-old female, diagnosed
with stage IV signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach
(Supplementary Figure 1A), a highly malignant gastric
cancer with poor prognosis [3]. At the time of diagnosis,
tumors had metastasized to the bilateral adnexa of uterus

(Supplementary Figure 1B) and possibly lymph nodes in
greater omentum (data not shown). Multiple bone lesions
were also observed by Positron Emmission TomographyComputed Tomography (PET-CT) (Supplementary
Figure 1C). The patient received a surgical resection
to remove the right adnexa of uterus and partial left
ovary, and was subsequently subjected to 8 cycles of
chemotherapeutic treatment and 3 cycles of targeted
radiation treatment (Supplementary Figure 2). However,
no clinical benefits were observed and the patient showed
progressive deterioration with a growing metastatic tumor
size in the left adnexa area, pleural effusion (Figure 1A)
and increasing bone lesions (data not shown).
Targeted NGS of 382 cancer-relevant genes and
16 genes frequently rearranged in solid tumors was
performed on a tissue biopsy from her left adnexa of
uterus and a contemporaneous ctDNA sample from
blood plasma to identify clinically actionable mutation(s)
(Supplementary Table 1). Both samples exhibited similar
mutation spectra, with the most noticeable genomic
alteration being an 18.1- and 17.8-fold relative copy
number gain of the MET gene in the tissue biopsy and
ctDNA, respectively (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Table 2). Other common genomic abnormalities found
were a relative copy number loss of TP53 and APC as

well as a number of inactivating mutations on tumor
suppressors such as APC-R216X, APC-K1444fs,
CDKN1B-P137fs and TP53-L111R (Figure 3 and
Supplementary Table 2). FGFR2 amplification was also
identified in the ctDNA sample (Figure 1B). However,
it was absent in the tissue biopsy suggesting that it may
present in other tumor site(s). A one-year old archived
FFPE tissue sample from this patient’s right adnexa of
uterus were also examined with the majority of these
abnormalities undetectable except for the relative copy
number loss of APC gene (Supplementary Table 2).
The patient commenced a monotherapy with
crizotinib in order to target MET amplification. Serial
ctDNA mutation profiling by targeted NGS was performed
monthly to monitor tumor burden and treatment response
(Supplementary Figure 2). The patient’s condition
improved immensely during the first month of drug
administration, as evident by a marked decrease in
abdominal tumor size and pleural effusion observed at
day 26 post-treatment (Figure 1A). Crizotinib treatment
also decreased the level of several cancer protein
biomarkers, including CA724, CA199 and CA242, plasma
concentration of total cell free DNA (cfDNA) and MET
relative copy number (Figure 1B and 1C). In contrast, the
relative copy number of FGFR2 in ctDNA increased to

In addition, a novel MAP2K1 (MEK1) activating
mutation C121S appeared in ctDNA on day 28, which
functions downstream of both MET and FGFR2 pathways.
Inactivating mutation APC-K1444fs also appeared on
day 28 and its MAF increased along with disease
progression (Figure 3A). Conversely, mutations in APC,
TP53 and CDKN1B (p27) identified in pre-treatment
tumor only showed relatively moderate fluctuations in
their MAFs (Figure 3A and 3B). Figure 3C summarized
the diversity of newly acquired mutations that may be
collectively responsible for crizotinib resistance in this
patient.

46.3-fold on day 28 post-treatment and maintained at such
high level thereafter (Figure 1B). As crizotinib treatment
continued, the concentration of plasma cfDNA and the
relative copy number of MET began to increase, with the
latter reaching 7.5-fold at day 74 (Figure 1B). Clinical
parameters such as CT imaging and cancer biomarker
levels also showed signs of progressive disease, and
confirmed that the patient had developed drug resistance
(Figure 1A and 1C).
Interestingly, de novo MET mutations at D1228/
Y1230 residues were detected in ctDNA as early as
day 28 (Figure 2A and 2B), when CT imaging and protein
biomarker levels were still showing promising response
to crizotinib (Figure 1A and 1C). Sequencing of ctDNA
at later dates revealed a steady rise in the variety and
abundance of MET secondary mutations (Figure 2). A
total of 8 MET mutations were detected on day 105 at
the D1228/Y1230 positions, with D1228N and Y1230H
in dominant (Figure 2A, 2B and 2D). The majority of
these MET secondary mutations have been reported to be
associated with crizotinib resistance in different cancers
[4–6]. MET mutations at other residues in MET kinase
domain were also identified, albeit at lower mutant allele
frequency (MAF) (Figure 2C and 2D). This outbreak
of MET mutations is likely due to reshaping of tumor
subpopulations under the selective pressure exerted by
crizotinib treatment.

DISCUSSION
Crizotinib, as a potent MET inhibitor, has
demonstrated promising effects in treating METamplified esophagogastric cancer [2, 7]. However, tumors
experienced progression shortly after treatment [2] and the
mechanisms of resistance were not clear. Comprehensive
genomic profiling in this study identified MET amplification
in the patient and led to administration of crizotinib. Serial
post-treatment ctDNA monitoring revealed multiple
genetic alterations that might be of value in explaining
tumor recurrence after 2 months of treatment. MET D1228
and Y1230 residing in the activation loop of the kinase
domain are predicted to reduce the binding affinity of

indicating the potential outgrowth of FGFR2-amplified
clones under MET-inhibition selection pressure. FGFR2
amplification has been identified in gastric cancers
and found to be associated with a poor prognosis
[14, 15]. Although several FGFR inhibitors have been
evaluated in clinical trials, none of them have yet been
approved for clinical use [16–18]. In summary, the
rapid progression of this patient might be due to both
acquired resistance mutations and pre-existing molecular
heterogeneity in tumor. The complexity and diversity
of potential drug resistance mechanisms in this case
highlight the importance of comprehensive molecular
analysis for developing therapeutic strategies for this
disease.

crizotinib to MET and also facilitate ligand-independent
activation of MET [8–10]. Mutations at V1092, G1163
and L1195 are located in the inhibitor-binding pocket of
MET with possible effects in interrupting crizotinib binding
[9, 11,  12]. Activation of downstream signal molecule
MEK1 (MAP2K1-C121S) has also been reported and could
bypass MET inhibition leading to drug-resistance [13].
Co-amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases, such
as HER2 or EGFR in MET-amplified esophagogastric
cancer has been reported as another mechanism that
drives resistance to MET inhibitors [7]. In this study,
increase of FGFR2 relative copy number was initially
observed in pre-treatment ctDNA sample at low level,
and then dramatically elevated throughout the treatment,

(C) Signaling pathways that were possibly influenced by mutated elements were summarized. In addition to overexpression of MET and
FGFR2 receptors, and MET activating mutations, gain-of-function of their downstream signaling (MEK1), and loss-of-function of tumor
suppressors (TP53, APC and p27) may also contribute to the drug-resistance and disease progression in this patient.

fragments by Covaris M220 instrument (Covaris).
For cfDNA, 2–100 ng DNA was used for library
preparation without prior fragmentation. Sequencing
libraries were constructed using KAPA Hyper Prep
kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s
protocol. In brief, DNA samples were subjected to endrepairing, A-tailing and ligation of indexed adapters,
and subsequently size selection with Agencourt AMPure
XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Resulted libraries were
subjected to PCR amplification with numbers of PCR
cycles suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol according
to DNA input. Amplified libraries were purified by
Agencourt AMPure XP beads and quantified by Qubit 2.0.

Ethical compliance
Patient information and clinical samples were
obtained from The Comprehensive Cancer Centre of
Drum Tower Hospital. The patient has given written
consent for specimen collection and the following genetic
testing. Sample collection and preparation protocols were
approved by the Drum Tower Hospital Ethics Committee.

Tissue and blood sample collection
A one-year old archived FFPE block of tumor
tissue from the patient’s resected right adnexa of uterus
and a fresh tissue biopsy from the patient’s left adnex
metastatic site were acquired from the pathology
department of Drum Tower Hospital. Serial blood samples
were collected before and during crizotinib treatment for
cfDNA extraction. In brief, 5–10 ml peripheral blood was
collected in an EDTA-coated tube (BD Biosciences), and
plasma was prepared by centrifuging at 1800 × g for 10
minutes at 4 degree within 2 hours of blood withdrawing.
Tissue and blood/plasma samples were sent to the core
facility of Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc. (Nanjing,
China) for DNA extraction and genetic testing.

Library hybridization and sequencing
Libraries with different indexes were pooled
together in optimized ratios to reach up to 2 µg of
total DNA. Human Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies)
and xGen universal blocking oligos (Integrated DNA
Technologies) were added as blocking reagents to reduce
non-specific hybridization. Customized xGen lockdown
probes (Integrated DNA Technologies) targeting 5,804
exons of 382 cancer-relevant genes and 37 introns of
16 fusion genes were used for hybridization enrichment
(Supplementary Table 1). The capture reaction was
performed with NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Hybridization
and Wash Kit (Roche) and Dynabeads M-270 (Life
Technologies) according to manufacturers’ protocols. Postcaptured libraries were PCR amplified with Illumina p5 (5′
AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GA 3′) and p7 primers
(5′ CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT 3′) in
KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems),
followed by purification with Agencourt AMPure XP
beads, and quantified by qPCR method using KAPA
Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems). The size
distribution of the library was analyzed by Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies). Target-enriched libraries
were then sequenced on Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq4000
NGS platforms (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Targeted capture and sequencing performance
of all the samples were summarized in Supplementary
Table 3.

Cancer biomarker testing
Serum levels of CA125, CA199 and CA242 were
measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
kits (Fujirebio Diagnostics), and CA724 level was
measured with electro-chemiluminescence assay kit
(Roche Diagnostics) in Drum Tower Hospital’s pathology
laboratory. Other clinical inspections (e.g. CT, PET-CT
imaging) were carried out in Drum Tower Hospital to
assess the abdominal tumor burden and pleural effusion
for better monitoring disease progression.

DNA extraction and quantification
cfDNA was extracted from 3–5 ml plasma using
NucleoSpin Plasma XS kit (Macherey Nagel) according to
its manufacturer’s protocol. Genomic DNA from the whole
blood sample and fresh tissue biopsy was extracted by
DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). FFPE sections were
de-paraffinized with xylene and subsequently subjected
to DNA extraction with QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit
(Qiagen). Purified DNA was qualified on Nanodrop2000
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and quantified using Qubit 2.0
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Size distribution of cfDNA was
examined by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies).

Sequence data processing
Trimmomatic [19] was used for adapter identification
and quality filtering of FASTQ files. Leading/trailing
low quality (quality reading below 15) or N bases were
removed. Paired-end reads from each sample were mapped
to hg19 (Human Genome version 19) reference genome by
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-mem, v0.7.12) [20] with
parameters (-t 8 -M). Local realignment around indels and
base quality score recalibration was applied with Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK 3.4.0) [21]. SNPs/indels callings
were made by VarScan2 (minimum quality score = 15
and otherwise default parameters) to detect mutations

with MAF < 10% (http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/) and
HaplotypeCaller/UnifiedGenotyper in GATK with default
parameters to detect mutations with MAF > 10%, followed
by filtration against dbSNP (v137) and 1000 Genome data
sets. Germline mutations were identified by comparing to
its matching whole blood DNA samples. Mutations were
called when their MAFs are above 1% with at least 3
high quality non-paired mutant reads (> Q30) on different
strands and manually inspected in Integrative Genomics
Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute). However, when a mutation
was called in any of the ctDNA or tissue samples, the
sequencing reads of other samples were retrospectively
inspected to detect such mutation with MAF < 1%,
but has at least 3 high quality non-paired mutant reads
(> Q30) on different strands, and reported (Supplementary
Table 2). Genomic fusions were identified by FACTERA
with default parameters [22]. Copy number variations
(CNVs) were detected using ADTEx (http://adtex.
sourceforge.net) with default parameters. Proposed discrete
wavelet transform (DWT) was used to reduce intrinsic
noise of the depth of coverage (DOC) ratios. The relative
copy number gain/loss of each targeted region is quantified
by hidden Markov model (HMM). Germline CNVs were
identified by comparing patient’s blood sample to normal
human HapMap DNA sample NA18535 (Coriell Institute)
for each captured region (exonic region). Somatic CNVs
were identified by comparing tumor/ctDNA sample to
blood sample for each exon.
