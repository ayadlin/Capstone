ABSTRACT
Malignant gliomas are difficult to treat in clinical practice. This study was aimed
to investigate the preclinical efficacy of CRLX101, an investigational nanoparticledrug conjugate developed by conjugating camptothecin (CPT) with cyclodextrinpolyethylene glycol, against gliomas. CPT fluorescence was detected across tightjunction barriers and in mouse plasma and brain. Following CRLX101 treatment, CPT
was distributed in the cytoplasm of human U87 MG glioma cells. U87 MG cell viability
was decreased by CRLX101 and CPT. Moreover, CRLX101 induced less cytotoxicity to
human astrocytes compared to CPT. Exposure of U87 MG cells to CRLX101 induced
G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Administration of CRLX101 induced apoptosis in
mice brain tumor tissues and prolonged the survival rate of mice. In addition, CRLX101
inhibited hypoxia and angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of carbonic
anhydrase IX, vascular endothelial growth factor, and CD31 in tumor sections. Taken
together, this preclinical study showed that CRLX101 possesses antitumor abilities
by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioma cells and inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis, thereby prolonging the lifespan of mice bearing intracranial gliomas.
These data support further research of CRLX101 in patients with brain tumors.

cerebral endothelial cells (CECs), astrocytes, and pericytes
[5]. CECs form the tight junctions to limit penetration of
most drugs into brain tumors [6, 7]. Thus, developing
effective chemotherapeutic agents for brain cancer therapy
remains a challenge.
Camptothecin (CPT) is an anticancer drug which
inhibits topoisomerase I (Topo-I) [8]. However, CPT has
therapeutic limitations because of its poor water solubility
and an inactive form of CPT through an E-ring opening
reaction [9]. Although water-soluble analogs of CPT, such
as topotecan and irinotecan, were approved, these drugs
still exhibit sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and have doselimiting toxicities [10]. Recently, CPT-loaded mesoporous

INTRODUCTION
Grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common
primary brain tumor [1]. GBM is highly mobile and
invasive with a poor prognosis and high mortality [2].
Even with combined surgical and medical therapies,
the median survival of GBM patients is only 1 year [3].
Despite advances in aggressive treatment, malignant
gliomas remain a fatal disease. The poor outcomes are
because of uncontrolled tumor proliferation, infiltrative
growth, angiogenesis, and resistance to apoptosis [4].
In addition, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major
limitation for therapy of GBM. The BBB is constructed by

and in an orthotopic intracranial glioma model.

silica nanoparticles and amphophilic cyclodextrin
nanoparticles revealed their significant tumor-suppression
effect in pancreatic cancer xenografts and rat glioma
model, respectively [11, 12]. These studies demonstrate
that nanoparticle-based drug delivery system is beneficial
to enhancing drug efficacy.
CRLX101 (Cerulean Pharma, Cambridge, MA)
is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC), containing
approximately 10 wt% CPT conjugated to a linear,
cyclodextrin-polyethylene glycol (CD-PEG) copolymer
[13, 14]. Thecyclodextrin-containing polymer is
conjugated with CPT by covalent linkage to enhance
its water-solubility, and this physical integrity can selfassemble into a nanoparticle of approximately 20~30 nm
diameter [13]. A rat pharmacokinetic study showed that
the plasma concentrations and the area under the curve
of polymer-conjugated CPT are higher than those of
CPT alone [15]. The intratumoral concentration of CPT
harvested from CRLX101-treated mice was also higher
than that with CPT administration in human LS174T
colorectal cancer xenografts [13, 15]. Therefore, the
enhanced pharmacokinetics and distribution profiles of
CRLX101 augment the efficacy of CPT [16]. CRLX101
exhibited anticancer activity in various cancer xenografts,
such as colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers [9, 16]
and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (NCT02187302) and recurrent
ovarian cancer (NCT01652079) in combination with
bevacizumab, and in phase 1b/2a in combination
with chemoradiation in neoadjuvant rectal cancer
(NCT02010567). However, the effects of CRLX101 on
brain cancer therapy remain unclear.
Hypoxic regions are frequently found in GBM
and linked to cell proliferation, cell death, invasion,
metastasis, and poor prognoses [17]. Carbonic anhydrase
IX (CA IX) is a transmembrane glycoprotein to maintain
the acid-base balance and intercellular communication
[18]. CA IX is considered a marker of hypoxia and is a
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α target gene [19, 20].
Angiogenesis is a key process of forming new blood
vessels during tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis
during hypoxic conditions [21]. Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), a major paracrine mediator in the
pathogenesis of glioblastomas and tumor angiogenesis
[22, 23], is also induced by HIF-1α [24]. VEGF-targeting
agents can inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth in
various cancers [25]. The topoisomerase I inhibitors,
topotecan and CPT analogs, were shown to be HIF-1α
inhibitors that decrease angiogenesis [26]. CRLX101 has
also been shown to inhibit HIF-1α preclinically [27]. A
pilot trial of oral topotecan in patients with advanced solid
tumors showed that it decreased HIF-1α expression [28].
In view of the fact that suppression of angiogenesis and
hypoxia are critical steps in developing curative therapy
for GBM, we investigated the preclinical efficacy of
CRLX101 against GBM. We revealed for the first time

RESULTS
The activity of CPT passing through a tightjunction barrier and the distribution of
CRLX101 in cells
To determine whether CRLX101 treatment results
in measurable CPT concentrations across a tight-junction
barrier, an in vitro BBB model was established. After
constructing a tight-junction barrier, data from the TEER
assay showed the integrity of the tight-junction barrier
(Figure 1A). Addition of CRLX101 for 24 hours did not
affect the permeability or integrity of this barrier (Figure
1A). After CRLX101 was added to the upper layer of
a transwell for 0~24 hours, the concentration of CPT
passing through the tight junction barrier increased in a
time-dependent manner (Figure 1B). In addition, after
intravenous injection of CRLX101 into ICR mice, CPT
fluorescence could be stably detected at 0.5-24 hours
post-administration with concentrations ranging from
3702±378 to 7003±796 ng/ml in plasma (Figure 1C)
and 76±26 to 131±32 ng/g in brain tissues (Figure 1D).
To evaluate whether CRLX101 can enter cells as intact
nanoparticles, U87 MG cells were treated with CPT or
CRLX101 for 6 hours and then stained with Mitotracker
Red to approximately indicate the shape of cells. Although
both fluorescent drugs were located inside the cell
cytoplasm, stronger fluorescence was found in CRLX101treated cells compared to CPT-treated cells (Figure 1E).
Furthermore, following CRLX101 treatment, CPT was
evenly distributed in the entire cell cytoplasm; whereas
following CPT treatment, less CPT was distributed in the
cytoplasm (data not shown).

In vitro cytotoxicity of CRLX101 against glioma
cells and astrocytes
Treatment of U87 MG cells with 25~400 nM
CRLX101 or CPT for 72 hours decreased cell numbers
and caused cell shrinkage (Figure 2A, top and third rows).
CRLX101 only slightly inhibited the growth of normal
HA-h astrocytes (Figure 2A, second row). However,
administration of CPT caused shrinkage and cell numbers
in HA-h astrocytes (Figure 2A, bottom row). Both
CRLX101 and CPT decreased the viability of U87 MG
cells in dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). HA-h cell
viability was sustained at around 87% after treatment
with 25~400 nM CRLX101. However, CPT suppressed
viability of human HA-h cells more significantly compared
to CRLX101 (p<0.05) (Figure 2B). The 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of CRLX101 and CPT on U87 MG
cells were 204 and 142 nM, respectively. Thus, a dose of
200 nM was chosen for use in the following experiments.

To investigate whether the cell cycle was affected
by CRLX101, DNA contents of cells were detected using
flow cytometry with PI staining. Treatment with 200 nM
CRLX101 induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase
from 24 to 72 hours and increased percentage of cells
in the subG1 phase at 48 and 72 hours (Figure 3A). In
parallel, CPT increased percentages of cells in the G2/M

percentage of total apoptosis significantly increased after

we demonstrated that the EGFR (Figure 4A, lower-left

to reveal the efficacy of CRLX101, tumor-bearing mice
were injected with 10 mg/kg CRLX101 or CPT once/week
for 2 weeks 4 days after tumor implantation. The time line

for the administration of CRLX101 or CPT is depicted in
Figure 4B. The survival rate was analyzed after the mice
expired naturally or were euthanized. Median survival times
of mice without treatment and following treatment with
CRLX101 or CPT were 22, 35, and 32 days, respectively.
CRLX101 prolonged the survival rate of mice as assessed
by a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and analyzed using a
log-rank test (Figure 4C). In addition, administration of
CRLX101 or CPT decreased Topo-I expression in tumor
sections (Figure 4D). Compared to the vehicle and the CPT
treatment groups, administration of CRLX101 significantly
increased number of TUNEL-positive glioma cells in brain
tumor tissues (Figure 4E and 4F).

The BBB tight junctions limit the number of
therapeutic drugs entering the brain [27]. A study showed
that, after administration of CRLX101, concentrations of
released CPT in tumor tissues harvested from LS174T
colorectal cancer xenograft mice were higher than in the
other tissues, such as the liver, spleen, lungs, and heart
[8]. In our in vitro BBB model, CPT was detected in the
bottom of the transwells. Moreover, our pharmacokinetic
analyses showed similar and extended time course patterns
for levels of CPT in the plasma and brains of ICR mice
intravenously injected with CRLX101. Schluep et al.
reported a longer mean elimination half-life for polymerconjugated CPT than for CPT injection in multiple cancer
models [9]. However, this study has no evidence showing
penetration of CRLX101 into the BBB. A previous study
demonstrated that intact CRLX101 nanoparticles can
enter PC-3 cells and release CPT intracellularly [28]. In
addition, our data confirmed uniform drug distribution in
the cytoplasm of U87 MG cells treated with CRLX101.
Our results showed that the CPT component of CRLX101
can cross the tight-junction barrier, retain in brain tissues,
and enter glioma cells. Therefore, CRLX101 should be
explored further as a potential agent for brain cancer
therapy.
In this study, CRLX101 suppressed the cell viability
of U87 MG cells in dose- and time-dependent manners.
The IC50 of CRLX101, when treating U87 MG cells, was
204.1 nM, which is reasonable compared to previous
studies with IC50 concentrations for lymphoma cells and
gastric cancer cells [29, 31]. Our results are consistent
with previous studies, reporting lower in vitro potency of
CRLX101 due to slow CPT release from CRLX101 [10,
29]. Importantly, CRLX101 had higher cytotoxicity in
U87 MG cells than in normal HA-h astrocytes. In contrast,
CPT damaged more HA-h astrocytes than CRLX101.
CPT, a Topo-I inhibitor can induce G2/M cell cycle arrest
in human colorectal carcinoma cells, human glioblastoma
cell lines, neuroblastoma cells, and breast cancer cells
[32–35]. Herein, we showed that CRLX101 significantly
induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in U87 MG
cells. Administration of CRLX101 or CPT prolonged the
survival rate of mice with intracranial gliomas. CRLX101
suppressed the expression of Topo-I and increased
apoptosis in tumor tissues compared to the vehicle or
CPT groups. Thus, CRLX101 possesses antitumor effects
against gliomas by inducing apoptotic cell death. Our
results suggest that CRLX101 provides a key advantage
for the development of clinical brain tumor therapy.
Angiogenesis is activated by the HIF-1α/VEGF
pathway in hypoxic tumor microenvironments [36].
Antiangiogenic therapy is often evaluated in combination
with chemotherapy for treating various cancers [25].
However, some patients do not respond to antiangiogenic
therapy or develop resistance due to intratumor hypoxia
caused by antiangiogenic agents. Therefore, combining
antiangiogenic and hypoxia-targeted therapies was

In vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic effects of
CRLX101
The expression of VEGF was examined using
immunoblotting to reveal the effect of CRLX101 on
angiogenesis. Protein levels of VEGF decreased after
U87 MG cells were treated with 25~400 nM CRLX101
(Figure 5A and 5B) or CPT (Figure 5A and 5C) for 72
hours. Exposure of U87 MG cells to 200 nM CRLX101 or
CPT suppressed protein levels of VEGF in time-dependent
manners (Figure 5D-5F). In the in vivo intracranial glioma
model, the expression of CA IX, a marker of hypoxia, was
highest in the vehicle group; administration of CRLX101
decreased CA IX expression more than CPT administration
(Figure 6A). Subsequently, VEGF expression in tumor
region was suppressed by CRLX101 and CPT (Figure 6B).
Both CRLX101 and CPT treatments resulted in decreased
CD31 expression compared to the vehicle group (Figure
6C). In addition, CRLX101 markedly reduced the protein
level of VEGF compared to the vehicle and CPT groups
(Figure 6D and 6E).

DISCUSSION
A preclinical study showed better efficacy with
CRLX101 than CPT-11 in inhibiting DNA Topo-I
catalytic activities and prolonging the survival of
lymphoma xenograft-bearing mice [29]. Emerging
clinical data suggest that CRLX101 is generally well
tolerated in cancer patients across several indications
[16], with early clinical studies showing encouraging
tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy results [30].
Our study is the first report of the preclinical efficacy
of CRLX101 in gliomas using both cell and animal
models. In addition, we have also shown the efficacy
of CRLX101 on killing human U373MG glioma cells
(data not shown). Thus, this study demonstrated that
CRLX101 has preclinical anticancer activities via (1)
induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, (2) inhibition
of angiogenesis in U87 MG glioma cells and in mouse
brain tumor tissues, and (3) increase in survival rate for
mice with intracranial gliomas.

investigated to improve clinical outcomes [37, 38].
A previous report suggested that CRLX101 treatment
inhibited the proliferation and angiogenesis of tumor
from breast cancer patients [39]. Our results demonstrate
that CRLX101 down-regulated expression of VEGF in
vitro and in vivo, and decreased CD31 in tumor sections.
Meanwhile, the expression of CA IX, a biomarker of
hypoxia, also decreased in tumor tissues. Therefore,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

our study suggests a promising effect of CRLX101 in
inhibiting hypoxia and angiogenesis. Moreover, our
in vivo results indicate that CRLX101 was more effective
than CPT in inducing apoptosis and suppressing
angiogenesis due to CRLX101’s improved drug delivery
profile and enhanced permeability and retention effect
[40]. Clinically, the combination of CRLX101 plus the

in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and recurrent ovarian
cancer. Further improvement in efficacy may be possible
by combining CRLX101 with antiangiogenic therapy.
In conclusion, this study showed that the CPT
component from CRLX101 could pass CEC-constructed
tight-junction barriers and BBB in mice, and locate in U87
MG cells. CRLX101 decreased the viability of U87 MG
cells through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, but
not necrosis. In our in vivo brain tumor model, CRLX101
prolonged the survival rate of nude mice with intracranial
gliomas by inducing apoptosis. In addition, CRLX101
had an antiangiogenic effect in vitro and in vivo through
suppressing the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway. Taken together,
our results suggest that CRLX101 may be a promising
novel agent for brain tumor therapy; further research is
warranted. However, there are certain study limitations in
this study, including the penetration of CRLX101 into the
BBB and its effects on tumor growth. We will use mass
spectrophotometers and the Xenogen IVIS-200 System to
determine these two effects in our upcoming study.

Fluorescence readings (excitation at 370 nm and emission
at 440 nm) of the measured CPT were analyzed using a
fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

Measurement of the transendothelial electrical
resistance (TEER)
Permeability of the CEC monolayer was assayed by
determining the TEER using an EVOM resistance meter
(World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) following a
previously described method [42]. The corrected TEER
value was calculated by subtracting the resistance of a
blank filter from the monolayer and is expressed as Ω/cm2.

Animal treatment for drug distribution
All procedures were performed according to the
Guide for the Care and Use of the Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996) and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei
Medical University (Taipei, Taiwan). Male ICR mice
were purchased from the Animal Center of the College of
Medicine, National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan).
Animals were intravenously injected with a single dose
of 10 mg/kg CRLX101 following a previous method [29].
Previous studies have shown the safeties of the empty CDPEG nanoparticles at a dosage up to 240 mg/kg in mice
[43, 44]. Mice were sacrificed and blood was collected
at 0.5, 1, 3, 12, and 24 hours post-dose and plasma was
separated from the blood. Acetonitrile was added to
the plasma, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10000
rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatant. Animals were
sacrificed after perfusion. Brain tissues were homogenized
and extracted with acetonitrile. To determine the CPT
concentration, the fluorescence of CPT in the supernatant
from brain tissues and plasma and standard CRLX101
were measured at 370 nm for excitation and 440 nm for
emission using a fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer).
Concentrations were calculated with a standard curve.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drug treatment
The U87 MG human glioblastoma cell line
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) was maintained in Minimum Essential
Media (MEM; Gibco-BRL Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100
mg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1
mM nonessential amino acids at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human astrocytes (HA-h) from
ScienCell Research Laboratories (San Diego, CA)
were cultured in astrocyte medium (ScienCell Research
Laboratories). Cells were grown to confluence before
drug treatment. CRLX101 was provided by the Cerulean
Pharma (Waltham, MA). The physical characteristics of
CRLX101 and its detailed assembly and disassembly were
described previously [13]. CRLX101 was dissolved in
sterile double-distilled H2O. CPT purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO).

Microscopic analysis of drug distributions
U87 MG cells were seeded on coverslip for 24
hours and treated with CRLX101 or CPT for 6 hours.
Cells were stained with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos dye
(Mitotracker Red, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD)
to label mitochondria in the cytosol. Fluorescence images
of CPT and Mitotracker Red were captured with a widefield DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied
Precision, GE Healthcare Life Science, Pittsburgh PA),
equipped with a 60x/1.42 N.A. oil-immersion objective
lens. Both the microscope and camera were controlled by
SoftWorX application suite software. Stacks of optical
section images, with an image size of 1024 x 1024
pixels, were collected for all fluorochromes. All images

Determination of transport through CEC tight
junctions
Isolation of mouse CECs and construction of
tight junctions were prepared according to a previously
described method [41]. Briefly, 106 CECs were seeded in
Transwell cell culture chamber inserts (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) for 4 days to form tight-junction
barriers. CRLX101 (30 μg/ml) was added to the top
chambers for 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours. After drug treatment,
medium from the bottom chamber was collected.

a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) and a syringe
pump (SINGA Technology, Taipei, Taiwan). Intracranial
glioma-bearing mice were randomly divided into three
groups (n=5/group) 4 days after tumor implantation and
were treated with intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg
CRLX101 or intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg CPT
qw x2 according to a previous study [29]. The survival
analysis considered death as either expired naturally
or euthanized prior to death. A Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis was performed at the end of the experiment.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assayed using 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT). U87 MG cells or HA-h astrocytes were seeded
on a 96-well plate at 104 cells/well for 24 hours, followed
by drug treatment for another 72 hours. Before the end
of treatment, 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well
for 4 hours. The supernatants were carefully aspirated,
and formazan crystals were dissolved using DMSO. The
absorbance was measured at 550 nm with a microplate
reader (Biochrom, Holliston, MA).

Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Mice were sacrificed 20 days after implantation
of glioma cells. Brains were removed and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and
sectioned. Sections for the histological analysis were
deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated with a graded
alcohol series, followed by antigen target retrieval for
20 minutes, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). For IHC, endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched in a 3% H2O2 solution. Slides were incubated
in blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies for the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) (1: 500, GeneTex,
Irvine, CA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(1: 250, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), Topo-I
(1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), CA IX (1:50, R&D
systems, Minneapolis, MN), VEGF (1:200, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and CD31 (1:75, BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were incubated at 4 °C
overnight followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies, for 1 hour at room temperature.
Slides were subsequently detected using a Vectastain ABC
kit (Vector Laboratories). DAB (Vector Laboratories) is
a substrate for peroxidase. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin, followed by dehydration in graded
alcohols and xylene, with the addition of a cover slip.
Photomicrographs were taken at 200x magnification
with a Nikon microscope equipped with a digital camera
(Nikon, Melville, NY).

Detection of apoptosis
Apoptosis was analyzed according to a previous
study [43]. After treatment, whole cells were collected in
HEPES buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 140
mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2. Cells were subsequently
stained with annexin V (2.5 μg/ml) and PI (2 ng/ml) for
20 minutes, followed by analysis on a flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The cytogram of the four
quadrants in the figure was used to distinguish normal
(annexin V-/PI-), early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI-), late
apoptotic (annexin V+/PI+), and necrotic cells (annexin
V-/PI+). The sum of early apoptosis and late apoptosis is
presented as total apoptosis.

Cell cycle analysis
After treatment of U87 MG cells with CRLX101 or
CPT for 24, 48, and 72 hours, whole cells were collected
and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Pellets were
resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Cells were then
washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 0.5
mg/ml RNase A and 40 mg/ml PI at 37 °C for 30 min in
the dark. The cell cycle was analyzed on a flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Results were further
analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 software (http://facs.scripps.
edu/software.html).

In situ detection of apoptosis
DNA fragmentation in brain tumor tissues was
detected using an In Situ Cell Death Detection kit,
Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN), based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) technology
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, brain
tissue sections were deparaffinized and permeabilized
in a permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 and
0.1% sodium citrate). Sections were then incubated with
a TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hour. After incubation,
slides were sealed with mounting medium containing
DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured at

Animal orthotopic brain tumor model and drug
treatment
Six-week-old female nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu,
National Laboratory Animal Center) were housed in a
sterile environment (in a specific pathogen-free room) with
a light/dark cycle of 12/12 h and were allowed free access
to food and water for 1 week. Animals were anesthetized
by inhalation of isoflurane and then were stereotactically
inoculated with 2 x 105 U87 MG cells (in 3 µl PBS) into
the right frontal lobe (2 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior to

Confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). Numbers of TUNEL-positive cells and total cells
were counted using MetaMorph software in more than
10 random microscopic fields. Results are expressed as
a percentage of positive cells to the total number of cells
counted.

Immunoblotting

Author contributions

After treatment, U87 MG cells were washed with
PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES,
1.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate
(SDS), 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM
sodium deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail. Protein concentrations were quantified using
a bicinchonic acid protein assay kit (Thermo, San Jose,
CA). An equal amount of proteins from each group was
separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were incubated with a 5%
skim milk solution (blocking solution) for 1 hour,
and then incubated with anti-VEGF and anti-β-actin
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
at 4 °C for 16 hours. Membranes were probed with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature,
and then imaged using a Syngene G:BOX iChemi camera
(Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and GeneSnap software
(vers. 7.09, Syngene). β-actin was used as an internal
control. The density of bands was determined with GelPro Analyzer densitometry software.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard error
(SE) from three or six (in the case of the MTT assay)
independent experiments. Statistical significance was
examined using Student’s t-test (for two groups) or a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; for three or
more groups). The survival curve of mice was examined
using a log-rank test. A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
