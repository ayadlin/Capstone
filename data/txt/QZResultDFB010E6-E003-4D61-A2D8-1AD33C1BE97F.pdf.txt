BACKGROUND: Polo-like kinases (Plks) control multiple steps during the cell cycle, and Plk1 is overexpressed in urothelial cancer
(UC). Volasertib (BI 6727), a Plk inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in several malignancies, including UC. In this phase
2 trial, the authors investigated volasertib as a second-line treatment in advanced/metastatic UC. METHODS: Patients who progressed within 2 years of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen received 300 mg volasertib on day 1 every 3 weeks. The dose was escalated
to 350 mg in cycle 2 if volasertib was tolerated in cycle 1. The primary endpoint was tumor response, which was assessed every
6 weeks; secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, safety, and pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, and the median patient age was 68.5 years (range, 52-83 years). All patients had received prior platinum, 94% of patients had relapsed 2 years after prior therapy, 36% had liver metastases, and 54% had lung metastases. The median number
of treatment cycles was 2 (range, 1-27 treatment cycles), and 23 patients were dose escalated at cycle 2. Seven patients (14%) had a partial
response, 13 (26%) had stable disease, and 30 (60%) progressed within 6 weeks. The median response duration was 41 weeks (range, 29.1-77.3
weeks). The median progression-free survival was 1.4 months, and the median overall survival was 8.5 months. The most frequent grade 3 and
4 adverse events were neutropenia (28%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and anemia (16%). No cumulative toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Volasertib as second-line treatment for advanced/metastatic UC had an acceptable safety profile but demonstrated insuffiC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Urothelial carcinoma (UC) has an annual worldwide incidence of 382,660 cases with an estimated 150,282 deaths each
year.1 In industrialized countries, UC is the fourth most common cancer (excluding sex-specific malignancies)1; and, in
the United States, there are an estimated 72,570 new cases and 15,210 deaths per year.2 On the basis of data from
randomized clinical trials, the standard first-line treatment for metastatic UC is cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.3-7 In 1 large, prospective phase 3 trial of 2 cisplatin-based combination therapies, gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC)
and methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC), demonstrated similar overall response rates (GC,

49%; MVAC, 46%), including similar complete response
(CR) rates (approximately 12% in both arms)5 and a similar median overall survival (mOS) (GC, 13.8 months;
MVAC, 14.8 months).6 However, long-term follow-up
indicated that only a small proportion achieved long-term
progression-free survival (PFS) (GC, 9.8%; MVAC,
11.3% at 5 years).6
For patients who relapse after first-line chemotherapy, the prognosis is generally poor8; there are no Food
and Drug Administration-approved agents in the United
States for this disease setting. In Europe, vinflunine (Javlor;
Pierre Fabre Limited, Castres, France), a microtubule inhibitor, is approved as a second-line therapy for advanced
UC based on a phase 3 trial of vinflunine plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in cisplatin-refractory
patients.9 Vinflunine led to an improved median PFS
(mPFS) (3.0 months vs 1.5 months; P 5 .001) and an
improved mOS by approximately 2 months compared
with BSC alone (6.9 months vs 4.3 months; P 5 .040) but
did not demonstrate a significant overall survival (OS)
advantage in the intent-to-treat analysis. Consequently,
there is a need to identify novel targets and to develop
more efficacious treatments for patients with UC who fail
or who cannot tolerate first-line cisplatin-based therapy.
Polo-like kinases (Plks), a family of 5 key serine/threonine kinases (Plk1-Plk5) involved in cell division and mitosis, represent a promising target. Plk1 is involved in the
passage of cells through the G2/M checkpoint and mitosis,
and Plk1 overexpression has been reported in a range of
human cancers, including nonsmall cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer,
and UC.10-14 Furthermore, patients with UC whose
tumors overexpressed Plk1 had a higher pathologic tumor
grade (P 5 .0024) and multiple tumors (P 5 .0241) compared with those who did not have Plk1 overexpression,
suggesting that Plk1 promotes tumorigenesis.13
Volasertib (an investigational agent; Boehringer
Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) is a potent and selective
cell cycle kinase inhibitor that induces mitotic arrest and
apoptosis by targeting Plk.15 In preclinical studies, volasertib inhibited the proliferation of multiple UC cell lines
(data on file; Boehringer Ingelheim) and demonstrated the
ability to promote mitotic arrest and apoptosis in UC
cells.16 Two phase 1 trials of volasertib in solid tumors
reported partial responses (PRs) in patients who had heavily pretreated, metastatic UC.17,18 Here, we report the
results of a phase 2 trial investigating the efficacy, safety,
and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of volasertib in the
second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic UC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design

This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 2
study of volasertib as second-line treatment for patients
with locally advanced, metastatic UC after failure of firstline systemic therapy (registered as National Clinical Trial
NCT01023958). The primary endpoint was the objective
tumor response rate, defined as CR or PR according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, duration of response, safety, and PK.
Patient Selection

Patients aged 18 years were eligible for this study if they
had histologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic
or unresectable UC of the bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis
after first-line systemic chemotherapy, or after initial surgery plus adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or after
chemoradiation. Recurrence was defined as relapse within
2 years after cessation of prior chemotherapy and was confirmed by imaging. Inclusion criteria were measurable disease by standard cross-sectional imaging according to
RECIST 1.1, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance score (PS) 2, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria were the
receipt of >1 prior regimen of chemotherapy (including
prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) and the presence
of brain metastases. Patients also were excluded if they
had inadequate organ function (defined as absolute neutrophil count <1500/lL, platelet count <100,000/lL,
hemoglobin <9 g/dL, creatinine >1.5 times the upper
limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL, or
aspartate amino transferase and/or alanine amino transferase level >2.5 times the ULN [>5 times the ULN in case
of known liver metastases]); serious concomitant illnesses
(including QTcF prolongation [eg QTcF >470 msec] or
congenital long QT syndrome); other active malignancy
diagnosed within the past 3 years (except nonmelanoma
skin cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia); or who
had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within the past 4 weeks. The study was conducted
in accordance with the ethical principles originating from
the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization. All participating patients gave written
informed consent.
Treatment

Volasertib was administered by 2-hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 300 mg once daily on day 1 of 21-day

treatment cycles. This dose was defined as the recommended dose for phase 2 trials from a dose-escalation clinical phase 1 trial.17 The maximum tolerated dose of
volasertib in this trial was determined to be 400 mg; however, serious but variable drug-related adverse events
(AEs) were reported at doses of 350 mg or higher. Dose
escalation to 350 mg was allowed at the treating physician’s discretion for cycle 2 and beyond if the disease was
stable and treatment-related AEs were manageable
(defined as the absence of unacceptable AEs: drug-related
nonhematologic AEs grade 3 [except emesis or diarrhea
responding to supportive treatment], drug-related grade 4
neutropenia for 7 days or complicated by infection, or
drug-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia). In the case of
unacceptable AEs, volasertib was omitted until recovery
and was then reduced by 50 mg for the ensuing treatment
cycles. Serial dose reductions were permitted; however, no
dose reductions below 200 mg were allowed. Continuation of treatment with repetitive cycles was allowed in
patients who had clinical benefit until they developed disease progression or unacceptable AEs.

cient increase to qualify for disease progression 6 weeks
of therapy] to progression or death). All AEs, including
unacceptable toxicities that occurred during the course of
the study, were classified according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0. All patients who received at least 1
dose of volasertib were included in the safety analyses.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis

PK analysis was performed to determine the plasma concentrations of volasertib during treatment cycles 1 and 2.
In cycle 1, blood samples were taken before volasertib
administration (0 hours), immediately before the end of
drug infusion (2 hours), and then at 3 hours and 6 hours
postadministration; further samples were taken on days 2,
8, and 15. In cycle 2, samples were taken on day 1 before
administration and at 2 hours postadministration. The
concentration of volasertib was determined using a fully
validated high-performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry technique as described
previously.15

Investigations

Statistical Analysis

At baseline, medical history, physical examination, assessment of ECOG PS, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory assessment of hematology, biochemistry, and
coagulation parameters were performed. Baseline disease
assessments by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, chest, abdomen,
and pelvis were performed within 4 weeks before starting
treatment. Routine CT/MRI scans of the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis were performed at the end of each evennumbered cycle thereafter until progression. If patients
discontinued treatment without documented radiologic
progression, then CT/MRI scans were performed at the
end-of-treatment visit and every 6 weeks thereafter until
progression, start of another anticancer treatment, or loss
to follow-up. After initial screening, a CT/MRI scan of
the brain was performed only upon clinical suspicion of
brain metastasis. After radiologic progression, patients
were followed every 3 months until loss to follow-up or
death.
Tumor response, the primary endpoint, was assessed
according to RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints were PFS
(time from first treatment to progression or death), OS
(time from first treatment to death), duration of overall
response (time from first response [CR or PR] to progression or death), duration of disease control (time from best
overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease [SD; defined
as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor suffi-

This study had a 2-stage design (modified Gehan) with
progression to the second stage dependent on an interim
analysis. The sample size for this trial was based on having
a lower 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 10% if a
RECIST-defined response rate of 20% was observed.
An informal interim analysis was planned once 20 evaluable patients had received 4 courses of volasertib (or had
discontinued because of unacceptable AEs or progressive
disease). If 2 of 20 patients achieved a CR and/or a PR
at any time within the first 4 treatment cycles of volasertib, then the trial could proceed to the second stage. In the
second stage, recruitment would be expanded to a total of
50 patients.

RESULTS
Patient Disposition and Demographics

In total, 62 patients from 20 centers in 2 countries (the
United States and Taiwan) were screened, and 50 patients
were treated. As of the January 17, 2012 clinical cutoff
date, all patients had discontinued treatment. Reasons for
treatment discontinuation were progressive disease
(n 5 48), AE (n 5 1 [grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia]), and refusal to continue study medication
(n 5 1).
The median patient age was 68.5 years (range, 5283 years), and 80% of patients were men (Table 1). The
majority of patients (94%) had a baseline ECOG score

value 10 g/dL. Seventy-two percent of patients had
received prior treatment with cisplatin-based therapy, and
the remaining 28% had received carboplatin-based therapy. The majority of patients (94%) had relapsed within
2 years after prior therapy.
Treatment Exposure

Patients received a median of 2 cycles of volasertib (range,
1-27 cycles). The volasertib dose was escalated to 350 mg
in cycle 2 in 23 patients, and only 3 patients required
subsequent dose reductions (1 patient each in cycles 3, 6,
and 9).
Efficacy

At the preplanned interim efficacy analysis, 2 of the first
20 patients who completed 4 treatment cycles achieved a
PR. Consequently, the study proceeded to the second
stage with a total of 50 patients treated. At the final analysis, the overall response rate was 14% (95% CI, 0.73%0.94%), and 7 patients achieved a PR as their best overall
response with a median response duration of 41.0 weeks.

the mPFS and mOS were 11.1 weeks and 10.6 months,
respectively. PRs were achieved in 7.4% of patients who
did not escalate, and their mPFS and mOS were 6.0 weeks

of volasertib. Similar response rates (14% vs 15%, respectively) were observed in both subgroups; however,

7 patients (14%) overall (Table 3). Cycle 1 AEs that
resulted in a dose reduction from 300 mg to 250 mg in
4 patients were neutropenia (n 5 1), ECG QT prolongation (n 5 1), thrombocytopenia (n 5 1), and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (n 5 1). Overall, 98%
of patients reported at least 1 AE during the study
(Table 4). The most common AEs (all grades) irrespective of their relation to the study drug were fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite,
constipation, and neutropenia. Grade 3 and 4 AEs that
occurred in 10% of the total study population were
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia (Table 4).
Only 1 episode of febrile neutropenia (grade 3) was
reported and was resolved within 13 days without complications. One patient experienced a grade 3 QTc prolongation during the first course of volasertib that
recovered to predose values within 6 hours. The predose
ECG revealed a grade 1 QTcF prolongation and a right
bundle branch block. The patient had a history of
hypertension. No clinically relevant side effect, such as
arrhythmias or cardiac dysfunction, was reported in
relation to volasertib administration. Three patients
died during the study because of disease progression;
none of those deaths were attributed to the study
treatment.
Pharmacokinetics

Volasertib demonstrated multiexponential PK behavior.
Plasma concentrations generally increased until the end of
infusion and then declined rapidly, followed by several
slower elimination phases. The maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of volasertib was 253 ng/mL at a time
(tmax) of approximately 2 hours (range, 1.53-4.17 hours).

The geometric mean volume of distribution (Vss) was
7470 liters, suggesting extensive tissue distribution
(Table 5). The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) averaged
150 hours, with a mean residence time (MRT) of 136
hours. The total plasma clearance was moderate, with a
geometric mean value of 914 mL/minute after infusion
of volasertib 300 mg. The PK profile of volasertib was
not significantly affected by sex, age, weight, body mass
index, or body surface area (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this phase 2, open-label trial, we descriptively evaluated
the activity of single-agent volasertib as a second-line
treatment for advanced/metastatic UC. Volasertib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Antitumor activity
was modest with a response rate of 14% (all PRs), which
did not meet prespecified criteria for sufficient activity to
justify further study as a single agent in this disease. This
modest activity is comparable to that observed in phase 2
trials of other single agents in this setting that reported
response rates ranging from 3% to 44%.8 Similarly, the
mPFS observed with volasertib in the current trial was
only 6.1 weeks (1.4 months); however, 16 patients (32%)
had a PFS >90 days (3 months), and 10 patients (20%)
had a PFS >180 days (6 months), suggesting that there
may be a subgroup of patients who benefited. PK analyses
confirmed that the modest activity of volasertib observed
in this study was not a result of poor tissue distribution or
circulating plasma levels. Volasertib demonstrated multiexponential PK behavior with extensive tissue distribution
and moderate clearance, comparable to that observed in
other studies of volasertib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.17-19
Approximately half of the patients (46%) in this
study were able to escalate to 350 mg, indicating the generally manageable safety profile of volasertib. A higher
response rate (22% vs 7%) and prolonged mPFS (11.1
weeks vs 6 weeks) and mOS (10.6 months vs 5.8 months)
were observed in patients who escalated to 350 mg volasertib. The seemingly better outcome in the higher volasertib dose group is likely attributable to an imbalance of
risk factors at baseline across the 2 dosing groups, with the
higher volasertib dose group having more favorable baseline characteristics compared with those who were not
able to escalate. This hypothesis is consistent with the
findings of a univariate analysis performed to determine
the association of various potential prognostic factors with
PFS (data not shown), which demonstrated that a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, the presence of liver lesions, and
the presence of more than 1 risk factor (defined as an
Cancer

April 1, 2014

ECOG PS >0, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, or the presence of
liver lesions) were associated with a shorter PFS.
Compared with other reports from second-line,
single-agent studies,8 more patients in the current study
presented with 2 or 3 poor prognostic factors at baseline.
Moreover, a relatively large proportion of patients (40%)
had nonbladder primaries, which were associated with
poorer outcomes in a first-line phase 3 trial.20 The
observed mOS for patients who presented with 0
(n 5 17), 1 (n 5 18), and 2 (n 5 13) prognostic factors in
this trial was similar to historic data on mOS (14.3
months, 8.5 months, and 2.9 months compared with 14.2
months, 7.3 months, and 3.8 months, respectively).21
Only 2 patients in the current study presented with 3
prognostic factors, so a similar comparison of mOS in this
subgroup would not be meaningful. Recently, the 3 aforementioned prognostic risk factors (ECOG PS >0, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, and the presence of liver lesions) were
refined further to include an additional factor: time from
prior chemotherapy.22 These factors may need to be considered as stratification factors in future trial designs. Notably, other recently reported, nonrandomized phase 2 trials
evaluating pazopanib and nanoparticle albumin-bound
paclitaxel demonstrated modest activity but also were
plagued by difficulties interpreting the overall results.23,24
Currently, there is no established standard of care
for patients who experience relapse after first-line therapy,
or are refractory to first-line therapy, or are unsuitable for
cisplatin-based therapy.25 The limited antitumor activity
of single-agent volasertib and the relatively short PFS
observed in this trial do not support its continued development as second-line monotherapy in a population of
patients with UC as a single agent. However, the safety
profile was acceptable, with primarily modest and reversible myelosuppression (and only minor nonhematologic
AEs). In addition, preclinical studies have demonstrated
that the combination of a Plk inhibitor and cisplatin
resulted in improved efficacy in both in vitro and murine
xenograft models compared with cisplatin alone.16 Preliminary evidence from a phase 1 trial in patients with solid
tumors demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity and
an acceptable safety profile of volasertib in combination
with cisplatin or carboplatin.19 Thus, further investigation
of volasertib in combination with chemotherapy or biologic agents in advanced UC may be considered.
In summary, although this phase 2 trial demonstrated
an acceptable safety profile for volasertib as a second-line
treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic UC, the
study demonstrated only modest antitumor activity. Compared with historic controls, clinical outcomes in this study

in terms of response rate and PFS were at the low end of
the expected range. A contributing factor may have been
the higher proportion of patients with a comparably worse
prognosis who were treated on this study. Additional biomarker studies would be beneficial to better understand
the role of Plk inhibition in tumor development and anticancer therapy. Before the initiation of further clinical trials
in UC investigating volasertib treatment as single agent or
in combination with other compounds, a better understanding of the mode of action of Plk inhibition and possible patient selection parameters may be warranted.
