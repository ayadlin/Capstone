BACKGROUND: Only 2 prospective studies have previously reported prognostic factors for anal cancer, European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 22861 (EORTC 22861) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 98-11 (RTOG 98-11). Both
of those trials reported that clinically positive lymph nodes and male sex predicted poorer overall survival (OS). The EORTC 22861
trial indicated that the same factors were prognostic for locoregional control. In the current report, the authors investigated potential
prognostic factors from the first United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research Anal Cancer Trial (ACT I), in which
patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy alone or chemoradiation (CRT) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C.
METHODS: In the ACT I trial, associations between several baseline characteristics and 3 endpoints were investigated: locoregional
failure (LRF), anal cancer death (ACD), and OS. The analyses were restricted to 292 patients who received CRT, which subsequently
became standard treatment. A score was derived using multivariable Cox regression to identify the set of factors that, together, had
the best prognostic performance. This score was then validated with a large, independent prospective trial (the ACT II trial).
RESULTS: Palpable, clinically positive lymph nodes were associated with LRF (P ¼ .012), a greater risk of ACD (P ¼ .031), and
decreased OS (P ¼ .006) in multivariable analyses. Men had worse outcomes than women for LRF (P ¼ .036), ACD (P ¼ .039), and
OS (P ¼ .008). On average, a lower hemoglobin level had an adverse effect on ACD (P ¼ .008), and a higher white blood cell count
had an adverse effect on OS (P ¼ .001). However, external validation of the score was poor for LRF (area under the curve [AUC] ¼
54%) but was better for ACD (AUC ¼ 67%) and OS (AUC ¼ 63%). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this analysis of the ACT I trial supported evidence for palpable lymph nodes and male sex as prognostic factors for LRF and OS, and lower hemoglobin levels and a

INTRODUCTION
Epidermoid cancer of the anus (ECA) is uncommon and may demonstrate an indolent natural history with a low rate of
distant metastases.1-4 The first United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) Anal Cancer
Trial (ACT I) compared chemoradiation (CRT) (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] and mitomycin C [MMC] plus and radiotherapy
[RT]) with RT alone in patients with ECA and confirmed the benefit of CRT.4,5 Contemporary trials support this advantage.6,7 Recent trials using cisplatin have failed to improve on this schedule.8-11
The outcome of patients with ECA varies, but several trials have suggested that CRT results in a locoregional recurrence-free survival rate of approximately 60% to 80%4,6-8,10 and an overall survival (OS) rate of 65% to 78%5,7,11 at 3 to
5 years. Prognostic factors represent easily measurable objective characteristics obtained from long-term observations
within a population that can offer information on possible outcome, irrespective of treatment. Knowledge of validated
clinical and molecular prognostic variables in anal cancer can be relevant to the individual patient, can refine and allow
individualization of different treatment strategies, and can direct rational follow-up.
To our knowledge, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 22861 (EORTC 22861)6
and the Radiotherapy Treatment and Oncology Group trial 98-11 (RTOG 98-11)12 are the only 2 randomized studies to
report analyses of prognostic factors. Results from EORTC 22861 indicated that skin ulceration, lymph node

involvement, and male sex were independent variables
associated with locoregional failure (LRF) and OS in multivariate analysis.6 CRT reduced the LRF rate but did not
improve OS.6
The RTOG 98-11 analysis could not establish prognostic factors for LRF but supported 2 of the poor prognostic factors previously reported by the EORTC
(clinically involved lymph nodes and men) and also established a tumor size >5 cm in greatest dimension as an independent variable predicting both poorer disease-free
survival (DFS) and OS.12 These factors have yet to be validated in an additional prospective data set.
The objective of the current article was to define
potentially new prognostic factors from analysis of the
ACT I trial that can be validated on the large ACT II prospective trial (n ¼ 940). Our findings would add to evidence of prognostic factors established by the EORTC
228616 and RTOG 98-1112 studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted an analysis of patients with ECA in the
UKCCCR ACT I trial. Patients were randomized to
receive either RT alone (n ¼ 285) or CRT (n ¼ 292)
combined with 5-FU during the first and final weeks of
radiotherapy and MMC as a single intravenous bolus
injection on day 1 of the first cycle of chemotherapy
between 1987 and 1994. Disease was staged according to
the 1985 International Union Against Cancer (UICC)
classification.13 Full details of the trial design, procedures,
and CRT schedules have been previously published.4
The primary endpoint of the ACT I trial was local
failure, either from disease or from complications of treatment, as indicated by the need for major surgical intervention. Five-year OS was a secondary endpoint. Death
notifications in the United Kingdom were received from
the Office for National Statistics.
In the current analysis, we considered 3 endpoints:
1) LRF at 2 years (because 85% of LRF recorded events
had occurred by then), which was defined as patients with
pelvic, inguinal, or local relapse (unlike the original
report, this did not include patients who underwent colostomy in the absence of recurrent disease); 2) anal cancer
death (ACD) at 5 years (because, by then, 86% of ACD
recorded events had occurred; patients who died of any
other cause were censored at date of death); and 3) OS at
5 years. We did not analyze colostomy, because an evaluation of colostomy has not been performed in the same
manner for the 2 trials—the ACT II evaluation is more
detailed (capturing the date of pretreatment colostomy
and the reason for colostomy formation). For each analyCancer

sis, we investigated the group of patients who had been at
risk for at least 2 or 5 years or who had experienced an
event by that time. For example, for 2-year LRF, we only
considered patients who had been followed for at least 2
years or those who developed LRF within the first 2 years.
Statistical Methods

We investigated several baseline characteristics: sex, age,
tumor site, T-classification, lymph node status, hemoglobin, and platelet and white blood cell (WBC) counts. All
analyses on the ACT I trial were restricted to 292 patients
who received CRT, because this is now standard
treatment.
The prognostic performance of each factor on its own
was determined by examining the true-positive rate (TPR)
(or sensitivity; ie, the proportion of patients who had the
event of interest [eg, LRF at 2 years] who had a certain characteristic or whose blood measurement exceeded a specified
cutoff) and the false-positive rate (FPR) (or a specificity of
1; ie, the proportion of patients without the event of interest who had a certain characteristic or whose blood measurement exceeded a specified cutoff). A factor with good
prognostic performance had a high TPR and a low FPR.
The likelihood ratio was calculated as TPR  FPR; thus,
the higher the likelihood ratio, the stronger the prognostic
factor. The prognostic performance of each baseline variable was examined on its own according to the endpoints
time to LRF, ACD, and OS. All blood values were used as
continuous variables. All variables were simultaneously
included in a Cox proportional hazards model, and backwards elimination was used to produce the final model, in
which the selected variables were associated independently
with outcomes (each had a P value < .05 after adjustment
for the other factors in the model). A prognostic score was
then generated from the linear predictor of the variables
from the final Cox model (using the hazard ratio [HR] estimate for each factor).
The score was validated externally using an independent, large, randomized study: the ACT II trial.14,15
That study was based on 940 patients who were recruited
between 2001 and 2008 and received CRT (radiotherapy
to 50.4 Gray [Gy]; 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 daily as a continuous, 24-hour infusion over 4 days in weeks 1 and 5 with
either MMC 12 mg m2 as an intravenous bolus on day 1
of chemotherapy or cisplatin 60 mg/m2 by as an intravenous infusion on days 1 and 29).10 That trial is currently
in long-term follow-up. The prognostic score was obtained
for each ACT II patient, and the TPR and likelihood ratio
were calculated at fixed FPR values. At the time of the current analyses, the following numbers of events were

reported in the ACT II trial: 130 (2-year LRF), 137 (5year ACD), and 186 (5-year OS).
Prognostic test performance also was examined
using receiver operating curves and area under the curve
(AUC) analysis. In such analyses, the closer the AUC is to
1, the better the prognostic model. Stata version 12.1 statistical software package (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex) was used to analyze the data.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Of the 292 patients who received CRT in the ACT I trial,
9 patients who had metastases at the time of entry were
excluded, leaving 283 patients for the ACD and OS analyses. For the time to LRF, an additional 8 patients who
died or relapsed within 6 weeks of the end of initial treat750

ment who, thus, were considered refractory to treatment
were excluded (n ¼ 275).
Table 1 provides data on the prognostic performance of each baseline characteristic separately. The best
factor for 5-year ACD is palpable, clinically involved inguinal lymph nodes (PCIINs), which had a TPR of 36%,
an FPR of 12%, and a likelihood ratio of 2.94 (among
patients who died of anal cancer within 5 years, the proportion of those with palpable lymph nodes was 2.94
times greater than among those who did not have the
event [ACD]). None of the other factors on their own
were striking; that is, the TPR was not materially higher
than the FPR.
Table 2 provides findings from the Cox regression
models based on all baseline factors (for the 3 endpoints).
Men and PCIINs were independent risk factors for all 3
endpoints (LRF, ACD, and OS).

Each HR was adjusted for all other factors in the same model. The table lists the factors that were selected from backward elimination Cox regression
modeling.

Sex

LRF, ACD, and OS were better for women than for
men. Univariate effects revealed a clear disadvantage for
men (Figs. 1A, 2A, 3A). In multivariable analysis, compared with women, men had an increased risk of LRF by
60% (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.03-2.49; P ¼ .036), an 80%
increased risk of ACD (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.03-3.16; P
¼ .039), and a 56% greater risk of any death (HR, 1.56;
95% CI, 1.12-2.17; P ¼ .008).
Clinical lymph node status

PCIINs were associated with a poorer outcome
compared with impalpable lymph nodes. Univariate
effects indicated an improvement for impalpable lymph
nodes (Figs. 1B, 2B, 3B). The patients who had PCIINs
had a 87% increased risk of LRF (HR, 1.87; 95% CI,
1.15-3.05; P ¼ .012), a 83% greater risk of ACD (HR,
1.83; 95% CI, 1.06-3.18; P ¼ .031), and worse OS (HR,
1.74; 95% CI, 1.17-2.58; P ¼ .006). The proportional
hazards assumption was not violated for any of the 3
endpoints.
Hemoglobin also was associated independently with
ACD. On average, a single-unit (g/dL) increase in hemoglobin was associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of
ACD (P ¼ .008) after adjusting for sex and lymph node
status. For example, comparing a baseline hemoglobin level
of 11 g/dL versus 10 g/dL or 16 g/dL versus 15 g/dL, on average, will suggest a 19% reduction in the risk of ACD.
In addition, the WBC count was identified as an independent risk factor for OS. The adjusted HR indicated
Cancer

February 15, 2013

an average 11% increase in the risk of any death per 1 
109/L increase in the WBC count (HR, 1.11; 95% CI,
1.04-1.18; P ¼ .001). This was irrespective of whether the
baseline WBC count was in the normal range. Unsurprisingly, increased age is also was prognostic for any death
(HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15-1.35; P < .001).
Validation of the Prognostic Score in the
Independent Data Set: ACT II

The prognostic performance using the above factors selected
by Cox regression modeling is provided in Table 3 (also see
Box 1). The likelihood ratio for values of the prognostic
score for 2-year LRF does not suggest a particularly good
performance, because the TPRs are close to the FPRs, and
all likelihood ratio values are <2, which is far below the recommended level of 10 for a strong prognosis16 (AUC, 54%;
95% CI, 48%-60%). The prognostic performance is better,
but only moderate, for 5-year ACD (AUC: 67%; 95% CI,
61%-73%) and OS (AUC: 63%; 95% CI, 58%-68%).
DISCUSSION
The current analyses support previous evidence that
PCIINs and men with ECA are prognostic factors for
LRF and OS in addition to ACD. For the ACT I study,
data on skin ulceration were not available. Presenting hemoglobin level and an increased initial WBC count may
be further useful prognostic factors for ACD and OS,
respectively. Age is prognostic for OS only. Tumor site
(canal vs margin), clinical T-classification, and platelets
were not prognostic for LRF, ACD, or OS.

Lymph node involvement appears to be an important prognostic factor for LRF and OS.7,16,17 In multivariate analyses of retrospective, nonrandomized data sets,
tumor size and lymph node status are the strongest prognostic factors for a poor outcome after CRT.18-20 One retrospective study suggested that tumor site was
important.21 In addition, several factors in retrospective
analyses indicated a higher risk of developing metastatic
disease, ie, increasing T-classification, N-stage, and basaloid histology.18 The American National Cancer Data
Base has identified men, age 65 years, T-classification,
N-stage, distant metastases, or poorly differentiated histology as prognostic factors for survival from almost
20,000 patients who were treated from 1985 to 2000.3

analyses, we used the ACT II data to externally validate

the previously reported EORTC prognostic factors (palpable lymph nodes and men) and established the greatest
tumor dimension as an independent variable predicting
DFS and OS.12 These factors have not been validated by
an additional prospective data set.
Data from the current analysis support findings
from 2 previously reported prognostic factors (lymph
node status and sex) as independent pretreatment variables that predict LRF and OS. Whereas RTOG 98-11
examined DFS, EORTC 22861 and ACT I assessed the
prognostic factors for LRF. OS may be a less useful endpoint in anal cancer than ACD. After 12 years of followCancer

The prognostic score is based on the combination of selected factors
measured at baseline (locoregional failure: sex and lymph node status; anal
cancer death: sex, lymph node status, and hemoglobin level; overall survival: sex, lymph node status, age, and white blood cell count).
b
The FPR indicates the proportion of patients who did not have the outcome of interest (eg, those who did not have locoregional failure at 2 years)
whose prognostic score exceeded the specified cut-off; the TPR indicates
the proportion of patients who did have the outcome of interest (eg, those
who had locoregional failure at 2 years) whose prognostic score exceeded
the specified cut-off; the LR is calculated as TPR  FPR.
c
The prognostic score for locoregional failure is based only on categorical
variables (sex and lymph node status); and, because the score has only 4
values, there is not always an FPR of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 50%.

up in ACT I,5 there was a large treatment difference in
locoregional control favoring CRT, but no statistically
significant treatment effect on OS was reported, although
a 14% reduction in the risk of death was suggested for
CRT. This finding may reflect the possibility of surgical
salvage and more competing risks in the elderly.
One novel finding was the impact of hemoglobin on
ACD, which was documented in previous retrospective
studies.22,23 Anemia may exacerbate tumor hypoxia, leading to radioresistance and promoting aggressive phenotypes, tumor progression, and distant metastases. The
effect of hemoglobin is usually on LRF rather than survival. However, neither the EORTC 22861 trial6 nor the
RTOG 98-11 trial12 examined the pretreatment hemoglobin level as a prognostic variable. The use of hemoglobin as a risk-stratification factor may be useful in future
trials and may provide a method with which to identify

Original Article

Box 1: prognostic score
In determining the prognostic score for locoregional failure (LRF) we first assessed the baseline
factors that are independently associated with the outcome, using Cox regression. In the multivariable model, only sex and nodal status were associated with LRF. The hazard ratio (HR) for
each factor is given in Table 2. A linear predictor (LP) was then generated from the model containing just sex and nodal status:
LP ¼ loge HRsex  sex þ loge HRnodes  nodes
Where loge refers to natural logarithms; HRsex is the adjusted HR for the effect of sex on time
to LRF, comparing males vs. females, and sex is coded as 0 (females) and 1 (males); HRnodes is
the adjusted HR for the effect of nodal status on time to LRF, comparing those with palpable
nodes (1) vs. impalpable nodes (0).
In the case of this model the LP can take just one of four different values:
Female and impalpable nodes: LP ¼ loge (1.60)  0 þ loge (1.87)  0 ¼ 0
Female and palpable nodes: LP ¼ loge (1.60)  0 + loge (1.87)  1 ¼ 0.63
Male and impalpable nodes: LP ¼ loge (1.60)  1 + loge (1.87)  0 ¼ 0.47
Male and palpable nodes: LP ¼ loge (1.60)  1 + loge (1.87)  1 ¼ 1.10
The higher the linear predictor the greater the risk is of failing locoregionally.
This prognostic score based upon the ACT I data was then externally validated using the ACT
II dataset

patients who might benefit from future methods of
hypoxic modification of RT.24
Inflammation plays a role in the progression of cancer. Markers like the absolute WBC count and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio appear to have prognostic
value.25 The current findings are in keeping with a retrospective analysis in squamous cell cancers of the cervix, in
which patients who had a high pretreatment WBC count
(10,000/lL) had a significantly higher treatment failure
rate (P < .0001) and shorter OS (P < .0001) than
patients who had lower levels, suggesting that the WBC
count is an independent prognostic factor.26
There are limitations to this study. The prognostic
model for 2-year LRF was not a good predictor with the
ACT II data set (AUC, 54%) but was better for 5-year
ACD (AUC, 67%). The finding that ACT I data validate
poorly with ACT II data may reflect the finding that the 2
trials were conducted 10 years apart, indicating how
much treatment has changed in terms of imaging (staging
with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography has become more
common and may have led to lead-time bias). Other differences include the avoidance of a gap in ACT II and
more modern techniques of RT and surgical salvage. The
lack of impact of T-classification probably reflects the
finding that the ACT I trial used 1985 UICC staging
754

based on anatomic extent, whereas patients in the ACT II
trial were staged according the 1990 UICC staging system27 based on tumor size. Also, the LRF rate was much
better in the ACT II trial.
In the future, clinical, epigenetic, genetic, and germline variables could be used to develop a model that predicts response to therapy and prognosticates outcome.
The first step in developing such models may be the establishment of reliable prognostic factors and their
interaction.
Approximately 9% of newly diagnosed patients fit
into the worst prognostic category (men/PCIIN). The
current analysis does not provide data to suggest that these
groups should be treated differently. Newer tools, such as
positron emission tomography, could be incorporated
into initial staging and into the early assessment of
response in such a poor prognostic group.
In conclusion, the current analysis of ACT I complements 2 other studies, adding further evidence that palpable inguinal lymph node status and sex are independently
prognostic for OS, LRF, and ACD. In addition, after
adjusting for sex and lymph node status, the presenting
hemoglobin level is a further prognostic factor for ACD.
An increase in the initial WBC count may be prognostic
for worse OS. Neither tumor size nor skin ulceration
could be evaluated in our analysis of prognostic factors.

Prognostic Factors in Anal Cancer/Glynne-Jones et al

The current study provides an appropriate strategy with
which to alter existing risk-stratification systems.
We recommend hemoglobin as a novel additional
candidate biomarker for prospective trials to assess riskadapted therapies. Absolute and cutoff values of hemoglobin could easily and reliably be used between different laboratories to classify high-risk versus low-risk groups,
either to direct novel therapeutic strategies or to increase
the RT dose.
Clinically involved inguinal lymphadenopathy is
also a strong prognostic marker. We do not yet know
whether computed tomography-defined lymphadenopathy provides a similar prognostic value. Hence, stratification of both early stage and more advanced groups may be
possible in future trials according to these factors and may
be used to categorize different risk groups.
