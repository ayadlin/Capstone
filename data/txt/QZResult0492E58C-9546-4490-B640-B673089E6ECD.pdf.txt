DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of
transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells1–3.
Conventional DNase-Seq for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of
millions of cells4,5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called Pico-Seq, for detection of
genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single cell level are highly
reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene
promoters and the enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display
constitutive DHS while chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation
of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene
expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression.
Finally, we apply Pico-Seq to pools of tumor cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides from thyroid cancer patients, and detect
thousands of tumor-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and

enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one
single-nucleotide variant (chr18:52417839 G>C) in the tumor cells of a follicular thyroid
carcinoma patient, which affects the binding of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and correlates
with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, Pico-Seq can reliably detect
DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis for both basic
and translational research and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.

We developed a circular carrier DNA-mediated sequencing method, called Pico-Seq, to
analyze genome-wide DHSs in a few cells or even single cells (Fig. 1a). Application of
Pico-Seq to NIH3T3 cells generated DHS profiles of 10,000, 1000, 100 and even single cells
comparable to that of mouse ENCODE data obtained from 10 to 20 millions of cells (Fig.
1b). On average, about 317K unique Pico-Seq reads and 38K DHSs were detected per single
cell. Although the numbers of mapped reads and DHSs decrease as the cell numbers
decrease, the enrichments of reads in DHS in different single cells were very similar (23–
26% of reads in DHS regions), despite minor differences (Supplementary Table S1–S3).
Scatter plot analysis indicated that the DHSs from 10,000, 1000 and 100 cells are as
reproducible as the ENCODE data (Fig. 1c–d and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). The pooled
DHSs of five single NIH3T3 cells were significantly correlated with that of 1000 cells (Fig.
1e). We also observed high correlation of DHSs between single cells (Fig. 1f, Extended Data
Fig. 1d–l). Venn diagrams showed that ≥90% of DHSs in single cells could be detected in
1000-cells data (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Large fractions (41–82%) of DHSs
were shared between two single-cells (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2e–m). While only
35%–59% of the DHS in 1000-cells data were detected in each single cell (Fig. 1g and
Extended Data Fig. 2a–d), detectability increased to 72% when the 5 single cells were
pooled (Fig. 1i), suggesting single cell specific DHSs contribute to the total number of
DHSs detected in a population of cells.

Author Manuscript

The false discovery rates (FDR) of single cell libraries were 11%–13% (Supplementary
Table S2) when one Pico-Seq tag was detected within a DHS region, suggesting that even
detection of one tag is likely to represent a true DHS. Indeed, TSSs with one tag exhibited
significantly higher expression levels than those without any tag (Fig. 2a and Extended Data
Fig. 3a–d). The tag number at TSSs positively correlated with expression levels when the
number was low (0–3 tags), but expression levels do not significantly change when the
number was high (>3 tags) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d), indicating that the gene
expression is no longer limited by accessibility once the promoter has become accessible. As
expected, the tag density at TSSs in each single cell correlated with gene expression levels
measured in a population of cells (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3e–h), and almost all
promoters of highly expressed genes were accessible in each single cell (Fig. 2c and
Extended Data Fig. 3i–l). Consistent with these observations, the tag densities at
housekeeping genes were higher and variations lower than those at tissue-specific genes

(Fig. 2d). The number of cells where a promoter exhibited DHS correlated with its gene
expression; the genes with DHSs across all the five single cells have the highest expression
level (Fig. 2e). Further analysis showed that the genes with the lowest cell-to-cell variation
at promoters were significantly enriched in basic cell functions such as transcription, cell
cycle and RNA processing (Supplementary Table S4). The genes with the highest cell-tocell variation were significantly enriched in metal ion binding (Supplementary Table S5).
Next we examined the fraction of overlapping open promoters where DHS was detected in
either 1000 cells or one single cell in different expression groups. The analysis revealed that
while only 58–61% of the open promoters overlapped in the silent gene group, 98–99.9% of
the open promoters in intermediately and highly expressed gene groups detected in a single
cell overlapped with those detected in 1000 cells (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4),
indicating that the DHSs of active genes can be consistently detected in single cells.

Compared with promoter/proximal DHSa, distal DHSs showed lower tag density, higher
cell-to-cell variation, and noise (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Nevertheless, distal DHSs in
single cells were clearly enriched in active histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H2A.Z) but not repressive ones (H3K36me3, H3K9me2 and
H3K27me3) (Fig. 2g); which is consistent with the scenario at the population level 6–11 and
validated our single cell assay. Interestingly, DHS detectability in single cells correlated
with the degree of enrichment of the active histone modification (Fig. 2h and Extended Data
Fig. 5e–h), and also correlated with the number of active marks at the DHSs (Fig. 2i and
Extended Data Fig. 5i–l). The vast majority of DHSs were detected across all five single
cells when five active histone modification marks were present, whereas DHSs exhibited in
variable number of cells when only one or two active marks were present (Fig. 2j). These
results indicate that DHS at enhancers are variable between different cells and provide
strong evidence that multiple active histone modifications strongly correlated with
chromatin accessibility across different single cells.

We compared the DHSs detectability in single cell with the tag density of DHSs from 1,000
cells or 20 million cells. The results indicated the detectability of DHSs in single cell
positively correlated with the tag density from library by large number of cells (Fig. 2k,
Extended Data Fig. 5m). We hypothesized that strong DHSs are present in all the cells and
weak DHSs are present in only a fraction of the cells. If this is the case, more strong DHSs
and fewer weak DHSs should be detected within one single cell. Indeed, 80% to 90% of the
strong DHSs were detected whereas only 20% to 30% of weak DHSs were detected in single
cells (Fig. 2k, Extended Data Fig. 5m). Another prediction from this hypothesis is that
relatively fewer strong DHSs and more weak DHSs will be additionally detected as we add
up single cells. Pooling the 5 single cells indeed showed the fraction of detected weak DHSs
was doubled, whereas the fraction of detected strong DHSs only increase by a few
percentages (Fig. 2k, Extended Data Fig. 5m).
The variation of DHSs among single cells within a “homogenous” population is reminiscent
of the well-known phenomenon on variation of gene expression among single cells12. To
determine their relationship, we constructed 14 single embryonic stem cell (ESC) Pico-Seq
libraries (Supplementary Table S6–S8). Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq data13

reveals that tag density and variation at TSS of single cell Pico-Seq indeed correlated with
that of single cell gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, the genes with
DHSs in fewer single cells show high variation of expression and expressed in fewer single
cells (Fig 3a, b). These results further indicate that the cell-to-cell variations of single-cell
DHSs are predictive of gene expression. Consistent with this notion, we found a
significantly higher correlation between the technical repeats compared to that of two nontechnical repeat libraries (Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). The GO terms enriched among genes
with the lowest and the highest cell-to-cell variation in the 14 ES cells are consistent with
that in single 3T3 cells (Supplementary Table S9, S10).

We next identified 1,735 NIH3T3-specific DHSs and 2,180 ESC-specific DHSs based on
the 5 NIH3T3 and 14 ES single cell Pico-Seq libraries. Heatmap showed these cell-specific
DHSs display expected cell specificity in all the libraries (Fig. 3c). The cell-specific DHSs
are highly correlated with cell-specific gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f) and
enriched in distinct biological functions (Extended Data Fig. 6g, h). Super-enhancers play a
key role in regulating expression of critical cell-specific genes14–16. We identified 275
NIH3T3-specific and 231 ESC-specific super-enhancers and compared their single cell
Pico-Seq tag densities. The sub-peaks of 3T3-specific super-enhancers were associated with
substantially higher tag density in single 3T3 cells than that in ESC, and vice versa (Fig. 3d,
e), indicating that single-cell DHSs can help predict super-enhancers.

Chromatin defects underlie various diseases including cancers17. Profiling genome-wide
chromatin accessibility in patient cells, which are often limiting in numbers, would be
clinically invaluable. We applied Pico-Seq to cells dissected from follicular thyroid
carcinoma (FTC) sample fixed on FFPE slides (Fig. 4a). DNase I digestion resulted in
typical periodic cleavage patterns of nucleosome arrays and reads enrichment around TSSs
(Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a, b, c). Likewise, the genome browser displays showed
peaks (Fig. 4c), suggesting the cells recovered from the FFPE slides retains key chromatin
features.

HMGA2 is up-regulated in FTC18,19 and its promoter indeed exhibited higher accessibility
in the tumor than that in adjacent normal cells (Fig. 4d). Overall, 1,342 tumor-specific and
2,812 normal-specific DHSs are identified (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). The genes associated
with the tumor-specific DHSs were significantly enriched in the GO biological process
terms such as regulation of GTPase activity and response to hypoxia, and pathways such as
E-cadherin signaling, RhoA signaling, p53 pathway, RAC1 signaling and MYC
transformation (Extended Data Fig. 8). Among these were several interesting genes, such as
TIAM1 and PIP4K2A (Extended Data Fig 9a, b), involved in tumors20,21. Interestingly,
genes that are characteristic of PAX8-PPARG fusion22 in FTC are enriched in tumorspecific DHSs (Extended Data Fig. 8f and Supplementary Table S11), even though PPARG
gene rearrangement was not detected by FISH analysis of FTC #440 (data not shown). This
suggests that pathways associated with the transcriptional regulation by PAX8-PPARG but
not necessarily the PAX8-PPARG rearrangement itself is important in mediating follicular
thyroid tumorigenesis.

We similarly analyzed samples from two more FTC (#797 and #957) and one papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC #131) samples (Supplementary Table S12). Comparison of the
tumor-specific DHSs identified in the three FTC samples revealed very few shared DHSs
among all three FTC samples (Extended Data Fig. 10a). The HMGA2 promoter exhibited a
strong DHS in the tumor cells but not in their neighboring normal cells in FTC #440, while,
in the other two FTC cases (#957 and #797) the promoter shows strong DHSs in both tumor
and normal cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Instead, an intronic enhancer showed differential
DHSs between the tumor and normal cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b). These results suggest
that the mis-regulation of HMGA2 in the tumor cells may be attributed to different
regulatory elements in different patients. Analysis of PTC #131 also identified numerous
tumor cell-specific and normal-cell specific DHSs, which are enriched in disease ontologies
(Extended Data Fig. 10c). Overall, our results indicate that the vast majority of DHSs are
patient-specific, implying that these tumors may arise or progress via different mechanisms
in different patients.

To gain further mechanistic insight, we searched for genetic lesions within DHSs in
FTC#440 by comparing the DHS sequence between tumor and normal cells. A total of 31
potential single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were identified in the DHS regions, which
included both loss of heterozygosity of known SNPs and de novo mutations (Supplementary
Table S13). We confirmed the de novo mutation (chr18:52417839 G>C) at a DHS
downstream of the Thioredoxin-like 1 gene (TXNL1) (Fig. 4e). TXNL1 encodes a regulatory
subunit of the human 26S proteasome23. Down-regulation of TXNL1 is associated with poor
prognostic outcomes, aneuploidy in colorectal carcinoma24 and is implicated in cispatininduced apoptosis25. Interestingly, the G>C change appears to negatively impact the binding
motif of p53 (Fig. 4f) and correlates with significantly decreased expression of TXNL1 in the
tumor cells (Fig. 4g). p53 binds to this DHS in a human thyroid cell line (Fig. 4h). The G>C
mutation at this site compromises p53 binding (Fig. 4i) and impairs its ability to activate a
reporter promoter (Fig. 4j), suggesting that the G>C change may underlie the decreased
TXNL1 expression in the tumor cells (Fig. 4g). This SNP was not detected in the other 3
patients (#797, #957 and #131). Therefore, our strategy for searching SNVs in relevant DHS
regions seems to be a cost-effective alternative to whole genome sequencing for detecting
functionally important mutations in regulatory regions.

Tn5 transposase-mediated detection of chromatin accessibility (scATAC-Seq)26,27 in a large
number of single cells has been reported recently. However, the reads per cell generated by
scATAC-Seq may be too sparse to examine the cell-to-cell variation at individual regulatory
regions26,27. In comparison, our Pico-Seq detects a much larger number of DHSs per cell,
which provides information on cell-to-cell variations of individual DHSs. Pico-Seq is
expected to find its use in multiple settings, such as the analysis of rare cell populations
during lineage development and the study of clinical samples with extremely small number
of cells such as circulating tumor cells, laser-captured cells, core biopsy or fine needle
aspiration samples. Being able to evaluate of the chromatin states associated with the
specific disease or developmental programs may provide valuable new information for
developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these malignancies.

Methods
Cell culture and Sorting
NIH/3T3 tet-on 3G cells (Clontech cat# 631197) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen cat#
10566-016) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma cat# F4135-500ML) and 100U/ml
Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen cat# 15140-122). Mouse ES cells were cultured as
described28. Single cell suspension after trypsinization was used for DAPI staining
immediately before sorting by flow cytometry. Single live cells were sorted and deposited
directly into each tubes of a PCR strip-tube, which containing 30μl cell lysis buffer (10mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100).
DNase I digestion and Pico-Seq library preparation

Author Manuscript

To prevent loss of the extremely small amount of DNase I hypersensitive DNA (< 0.001pg)
released by DNase I digestion of single cells, we added a large amount of circular plasmid
DNA (30ng; 3×107 times of the DHS DNA) as carrier DNA in the subsequent steps of
library preparation. The circular DNA was not compatible with the adaptor ligation and thus
could minimize the non-specific amplification by the subsequent PCR. The PCR conditions
were optimized to amplify the small fragments (<200 base pairs) derived from DNase I
hypersensitive sites without prior fractionation of these fragments.

Author Manuscript

For DNase I digestion, 0.2 to 1 unit of DNase I (Roche, catalog # 04716728001) was added
to the cells and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μl
of Stop Buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10mM NaCl, 0.15% SDS, 10mM EDTA)
containing 1μl of 20mg/ml Proteinase K and 5μl of 6ng/μl circular carrier DNA. The mixture
was incubated at 55°C for 1 hour and DNA purified by Phenol-chloroform extraction,
followed by precipitation with ethanol in the presence of 20μg glycogen. The library was
prepared using Illumina kits as described29. The libraries were amplified using a two-step
method to preferentially amplify the small DNA fragments derived from the DNA
hypersensitive sites and to reduce non-specific amplification of the carrier DNA. The first
amplification was done with index primers with the PCR condition: 98°C, 10″; 67°C, 30″;
72°C, 30″ for 6 cycles. After isolation of the desired fragments (160 to 300bp) using 2% Egel (Invitrogen), the second amplification was done with the P5 and P7 primers with the
condition: 98°C, 10″; 68°C, 30″; 72°C, 30″ for 22 cycles. The fragments between 160bp to
300bp were isolated on E-gel and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500.
Recovery of cells from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides

The anonymized tumor samples from Ambry Genetics, IRB-approved with informed
consent, were used in this study. Three thyroid cancer cases were diagnosed as follicular
thyroid carcinoma and one case was diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Cells were
manually scraped off from the highlighted area of a paraffin slide using a razor blade and
resuspended in 150μl of deparaffinization solution (Qiagen, Mat. No. 1064343) and
incubated at 56°C for 3 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, 150 μl of lysis buffer
(10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) was added and
incubated at 37°C for two hours. The cells in the lower layer were transferred to a new tube
and digested by DNase I as described above. The formaldehyde cross linking was reversed

using an RNA extraction kit from (Qiagen, Cat #73504), following manufacture’s
instruction. After reverse transcription using an oligo dT primer, the mRNA expression
levels of selected genes were analyzed using the following gene-specific primers and probes
from Applied Biosystems: (HMGA2-Hs00171569_ml, TIAM1-Hs01021959_ml, TXNL1Hs00355488_ml, PIP4K2A-Hs00178197_ml and GADPH-Hs99999905_ml.

Validation of SNVs by Sanger sequencing
The tumor and adjacent normal cells from FFPE slides were recovered and resuspended in
100μl of 1xTE + 0.1% SDS + 0.2mg/ml proteinase K. Following incubation at 65°C for
overnight, the genomic DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol

Data, reads mapping and filtering—In this study, we constructed a total of 38 PicoSeq libraries including 8 NIH3T3 libraries (Supplementary Table S1), 18 ES cell libraries
(Supplementary Table S6) and 12 FFPE patient libraries (Supplementary Table S12).
Among these libraries, there are 5 NIH3T3 single cell Pico-Seq libraries and 14 ESC single
cell Pico-Seq libraries. We also prepared 8 RNA-Seq libraries using cells recovered from the
FFPE tissue section slides of FTC #440 (Supplementary Table S12). In addition to the PicoSeq and RNA-Seq libraries prepared in this study, we integrated the histone modification
ChIP-Seq data of NIH3T3 from our previous study30. We also downloaded the DNase-Seq
data of NIH3T3 cells and embryonic stem cells (ESC) from mouse ENCODE project31.
Reads of DNase-Seq/Pico-Seq/ChIP-Seq were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) or
human genome (hg18) using Bowtie232. Iterative alignment, in which the unmapped reads
were trimmed 5bp and were re-aligned until reads <26bp, were conducted for small cell
number Pico-Seq libraries and single cell Pico-Seq libraries. The reads with MAPQ <=10 or
redundant reads that map to the same location with the same orientation were removed from
further analysis in each library. The mappability of 1000-cell Pico-Seq libraries to the mouse
or human genome was about 40% while that of the single-cell Pico-Seq libraries was about
2% due to non-specific amplification of carrier DNA. The tag density at each bin of 200bp
was calculated by normalizing the number of reads in the bin to the total number of reads in
the library and the bedgraph were uploaded to the UCSC genome browser.

Peak calling for DNase-Seq/Pico-Seq and correlation between different
libraries—The DHS (DNase I Hypersensitive sites) in mouse ENCODE DNase-Seq data
and small cell number Pico-Seq data were identified using MACS33 by setting a p-value to
1e-5. The peaks identified in the ENCODE data were extended ±1Kb from the summit of
the peak if the peak size is <2Kb and overlapping peaks were merged. Then the number of
reads in each DHS for all DNase-Seq libraries and Pico-Seq libraries was counted. The tag
density at each DHS was calculated by normalizing the number of reads in the DHS to the
total number of reads in the library (possibility of a tag located on a base-pair per million
reads). Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) of tag densities at genome-wide
DHS between two libraries was calculated to indicate the correlation between different PicoSeq libraries. For single cell libraries, the reads out of DHS were filtered and the number of
reads in each 1000bp size bin was counted for generating the heatmaps. Any DHS region in
a single cell with a reads located in was treated as open accessibility thus a DHS in this

single cell. For the pooled 5 single cells, any DHS region with ≥2 reads located in was
treated as the DHS in the pooled 5 single cells.
The false discovery rate of the DHS detected in single cells—In a NIH3T3 single
cell Pico-Seq library, the total number of observed DHSs and false positive (type I error)
DHSs were denoted by NDHS and NFP, respectively. On the other hand, any reads that
located out of the DHSs detected in ENCODE data must be caused by noise generated
during library preparation. The noise level (σ) should be the total number of reads that
located out of the DHS in ENCODE data dividing total length of the regions that are not
DHS. The false positive are genome-wide noise level (σ) multiply the total length of the
DHS. Thus, the false discovery rate (FDR) should be the false positive DHSs dividing all the
detected DHS in single cell:

Based on this formula, we calculated the FDR for each NIH3T3 and ESC single cell PicoSeq library (Supplementary Table S2, S7).
Differentially expressed genes and tissue-specific genes—The reads from RNASeq libraries were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9) or human genome (hg18) using
bowtie232. The gene expression level was measured by RPKM (Reads per kilobase per
million mapped reads) and number of reads in each gene. The cell specific genes between
ESC and NIH-3T3 were identified using EdgeR (FDR < 0.05; Fold change > 1.5 or < 2/3)34.

We used tissue specificity index τ35 to measure the tissue specificity of each gene, which is
defined as the heterogeneity of its expression level across all the tissues. Assuming there are
n tissues, the expression level of a gene in the jth tissue is E(j) and the highest expression
level of the gene across all tissues is Emax. Thus τ is calculated by

The values of τ range from 0 to 1, with higher value indicating higher variation of
expression across tissues and thus higher tissue specificity, while the lower value indicated
the lower variation of expression across tissues. The genes with the lowest τ were could be
considered as housekeeping genes. In this study, we calculated the τ based on gene atlas data
from bioGPS. The 2000 genes with the highest τ and the 2000 genes with the lowest τ were
treated as the tissue specific genes and housekeeping genes, respectively.
The histone modification ChIP-seq data and peak calling—Since the peaks of
some histone marks such as H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 are very broad, we identified the
tag-enriched peaks using SICER36, which takes advantage of the enrichment information
from neighboring bins to identify spatial clusters of signals that are unlikely to appear by

chance. We set the window size to 200bp and FDR =0.01 for each histone modification
ChIP-Seq library, while we set the gap to 200bp for H3K4me3, H3K9ac; 400bp for H2A.Z;
and 600bp for the H3K4me1, H3K9me2, H3K27ac and H3K27me3. We calculated the tag
densities of each active histone modification peak and identified whether the peak is a DHS
in each single cell in order to find whether the enrichment of an active histone mark is
correlated with the number of cells with DHS at the same locus. We calculated the tag
densities of each single cell Pico-Seq library at each DHS and examined whether a DHS cooccurs with these active histone modification in order to find whether the chromatin
accessibility in each single cell is correlated with the number of histone modification in the
same locus. Two peaks from different libraries were considered co-occurrence if the
overlapped region accounts for >10% length of a peak.

Reads around promoters and subpeaks of super-enhancers—The RefSeq genes
(mm9 and hg18) were downloaded from the UCSC website. The regions ±1Kb around the
TSS were treated as promoters in this study. The number of Pico-Seq reads located in a
promoter was used to measure the chromatin accessibility of the promoter. We searched the
super-enhancer in NIH3T3 via ROSE15 based on H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data and Pico-Seq
data, respectively. We obtained a total of 275 high-confidence super-enhancers in NIH3T3
by identifying super-enhancers showed in both H3K27ac data and DNase-Seq data. In
addition, the 231 super-enhancers in ESC reported by Whyte et al.15 were used in this study.
Subpeaks in super-enhancers were identified by MACS and average reads densities around
these subpeaks of super-enhancer were calculated.

Single-cell specific DHS and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)—For each
DHS detected in ENCODE data, the number of reads in each NIH3T3 and ES cells were
counted. To examine whether the chromatin accessibility between NIH3T3 and ES cells are
significant different, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed on the number of reads in the
5 the NIH3T3 and 14 ES cells at each DHS. A DHS was active (indicated by 1) in a single
cell if there are ≥1 reads located on the DHS region in the cell, while the alternative is not
active (indicated by 0). The Fisher’s exact test on each locus was performed on the number
of cells with active DHSs and number of cells without active DHSs between the 5 NIH3T3
and 14 ES cells. The DHSs with p value <0.05 by both Wilcoxon test and Fisher’s test were
treated as cell type specific. Finally, we identified 1,735 single-cell NIH3T3-specific DHSs
and 2,180 single-cell ESC-specific DHSs. We employed GSEA37 to determine whether the
priori defined genes in or vicinity of single cell-specific DHSs showed statistically
significant differences between NIH3T3 and ESC based on the gene expression data.

Gene ontology of single-cell NIH3T3-specific and ESC-specific DHSs—In order
to predict the function of single-cell NIH3T3-specific or ESC-specific DHSs, we performed
gene ontology analysis using GREAT38 with the 1,735 NIH3T3-specific and 2,180 ESCspecific DHSs. It is obvious that the single cell ESC-specific DHSs are enriched with stem
cell development and differentiation genes and the single-cell NIH3T3-specific DHSs are
enriched with in genes with different functions (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). These results
indicated that the ESC-specific and NIH3T3-specific DHSs identified in the single-cell PicoSeq libraries predict important enhancers critical for tissue-specific gene expression.

Identifying tumor-specific mutation—We generated Pico-Seq libraries using tumor or
their neighboring cells recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue section
slides. The sequence reads were mapped by bowtie2 to the human reference genome (hg18).
The paired reads with distance <500bp were kept if pair-end sequencing was performed.
Then reads with MPAQ<20 and possible duplication were removed by SAMtools39.
Variation calling on each normal-tumor pair was conducted using SAMtools mpileup, with
diploid model, mapQ>=20 and phred-like score (BAQ)>=30. The variations that only
normal and tumor show different genotypes were kept. Then the low quality variations were
filtered (QUAL <20, MQ<20, FQ<0, VDB<0.01 and minor allele <3). We obtained 31
variation candidates in FTC #440 (Supplementary Table S13) and many of them were
located on the predicted TF binding motifs.

Tumor and normal cell specific DHS—The genome-wide DHSs were obtained by
peak calling of the normal cell Pico-Seq and tumor cell Pico-Seq libraries, respectively. The
DHSs in normal cells and tumor cells were pooled and reads in each library among the
pooled DHS were counted. The normal cell and tumor cell specific DHSs were identified
using EdgeR.

Figure 4. Application of Pico-Seq to FFPE patient tissue sections reveals novel
pathophysiological information on thyroid cancers

Author Manuscript

a. A full view of a Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slide of FTC #440. Cells recovered from
the highlighted areas were subject to Pico-Seq analysis.
b. Typical periodic DNase cleavage patterns of nucleosomes were detected for both the
normal and tumor cells by Pico-Seq.
c. Genome Browser image displaying the Pico-Seq profiles of the normal (blue) and tumor
(red) cells from two thyroid carcinomas #440 and #131.
d. Genome Browser image showing the increased chromatin accessibility of the HMGA2
promoter in the tumor cells of FTC #440 (left panel). qRT-PCR analysis shows the increased
HMGA2 mRNA level in the tumor cells (right panel).
e. A single nucleotide variation (SNV) was identified at a DHS near the 3′ end of the
TXNL1 gene in the tumor cells of FTC #440. The SNV location is indicated by the red
square. The SNV was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (highlighted region).
f. The G to C change in tumor cells negatively impacts p53 target motif. The SNV in the p53
motif logo is indicated by a red arrowhead.
g. The G to C change in the tumor cells is correlated with decreased expression of TXNL1
by qRT-PCR analysis.
h. p53 is bound to the SNV region in a human thyroid cell line by ChIP-qPCR analysis.
i. The G-to-C change decreases p53 binding affinity in vitro by gel shift assay.
j. The G-to-C change reduces the activity of the p53 motif to activate a reporter promoter in
vivo. The p53 motif from the p21 promoter was used as a positive control.
