BACKGROUND. Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) confers a survival advantage for the minority of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who achieve a complete
cytogenetic response. The question of whether IFN-a-responsive patients can experience further improvements with imatinib has not been answered. Imatinib
offers clear quality of life advantages. Furthermore, patients who achieve a major
molecular response (MMR) while receiving imatinib are likely to remain progression free.

METHODS. A total of 23 patients treated for a median of 4.5 years with IFN-a
(range, 1.6–14.3 years) who had achieved a complete (Philadelphia chromosome
[Ph] negative, n 5 15 patients) or near-complete (1–10% Ph, n 5 8 patients) cytogenetic response were studied. The primary objective was to determine whether

ceasing therapy with IFN-a and switching to 12 months of imatinib treatment at
a dose of 400 mg/day could improve the molecular response as assessed by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction of BCR-ABL transcript levels. Safety
was also assessed.

RESULTS. Every patient who had not achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-a
(n 5 16 patients) achieved an MMR after a median of 3 months of imatinib treatment. Significant BCR-ABL reductions (median, 63-fold; range, 18–425-fold) occurred
in 15 of these patients. Every patient who had already achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-a (n 5 7 patients) maintained an MMR while receiving imatinib. No patients
discontinued imatinib due to toxicity, but 1 patient withdrew consent.

CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that switching IFN-a-responsive patients to
imatinib leads to a rapid improvement in achieving an MMR, a response with
established prognostic value, and is well tolerated. The study should help
patients and their physicians make evidence-based decisions regarding the
potential benefits and risks of switching to imatinib. Cancer 2007;110:801–8.

uring the 1990s interferon-a (IFN-a) was the
preferred treatment for patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) who were not eligible for
allogeneic transplantation.1,2 A survival benefit is
conferred for the minority of patients with a complete cytogenetic response (CCR),1,3–6 but the drug
has a significant adverse impact on quality of life.7
The introduction of imatinib mesylate in clinical
trials in 1998 rapidly transformed the management
of patients with CML.8–14 In addition to superior
response, imatinib offered clear quality of life advantages compared with IFN-a treatment as measured
by physical function and well-being.15
Although imatinib has surpassed IFN-a as the
gold standard for the treatment of CML, patients
who have responded well to IFN-a may remain on
this treatment. For those who achieved a CCR, the
10-year survival rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 62–82%), and was found to be correlated
with the risk profile.16 Patients who commenced IFNa with a high risk and achieved a CCR had significantly shorter survival. In contrast, for first-line imatinib-treated patients with CCR there was no
significant difference in the overall survival noted
between the Sokal risk groups after 60 months of
imatinib treatment.14 Moreover, retrospective comparison with historical data has demonstrated an
improved overall survival for patients treated with
imatinib compared with IFN-a.17–20
The important clinical question of whether
patients who are responsive to IFN-a can experience
further improvements with imatinib treatment remains
unanswered. The landmark studies that demonstrated
the efficacy and safety of imatinib did not include
patients who were responsive to IFN-a.8,9,12 Clinicians
and patients need evidence to clarify the benefits and
risks of replacing IFN-a with imatinib in IFN-aresponsive CML patients. Therefore, the purpose of
this study was to investigate the efficacy, as assessed
by an improvement in the molecular response, and
safety of imatinib treatment in patients with chronic
phase CML who have had prolonged exposure to IFNa and achieved a complete (Philadelphia chromosome
[Ph] negative) or near complete (1–10% Ph) cytogenetic response to IFN-a treatment. The molecular
response of patients treated with imatinib is considered to be more significant than the cytogenetic
response and is an important prognostic indicator.14,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty-three patients with chronic phase CML were
included in this prospective, multicenter, phase 2

clinical trial. Patients had a complete (n 5 15
patients) or near-complete (n 5 8 patients), stable
cytogenetic response for at least the previous 6
months while being treated with IFN-a as a single
agent. The median time since the initiation of IFN-a
was 4.5 years (range, 1.6–14.3 years). IFN-a was adequately tolerated in these patients with very little
toxicity observed, and none above grade 1. All subjects provided voluntary, written informed consent
before any trial-specific procedures were performed.
Patients ceased treatment with IFN-a and initiated
imatinib treatment at a dose of 400 mg/day for 12
months. The study was initiated in April 2002 and
completed in December 2004. At the conclusion of
the 12-month assessment, patients were offered continuation of imatinib treatment.

Efficacy Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
Efficacy was measured by molecular and cytogenetic
assessment at the screening visit (scheduled for <1
month before study entry), then every 3 months after
commencing imatinib treatment. Molecular response
was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis of peripheral blood
performed at a single institution in Adelaide, South
Australia.22,23 The response was assessed by: 1) the
first achievement of a BCR-ABL/BCR% level equivalent to a major molecular response (MMR) (BCRABL/BCR% of 0.08% in the Adelaide laboratory), or
the maintenance of MMR after switching to imatinib
treatment; and 2) the fold reduction of BCR-ABL/
BCR% from the screening level to the lowest level
achieved while receiving imatinib treatment. A >10fold reduction of BCR-ABL/BCR% from the screening
level to the lowest level achieved was considered a
significant response for this study. For patients with
BCR-ABL that became undetectable while receiving
imatinib treatment, the fold reduction was calculated
as the minimum according to the sensitivity of analysis. The sensitivity was determined by the control
gene transcript level of each RNA sample.24,25 Loss of
MMR was defined as a >2-fold rise to a level above
BCR-ABL/BCR% of 0.08%.26
Cytogenetic response was determined in at least
20 metaphases by the percentage of Ph-positive cells
in the bone marrow and was categorized as: complete (CCR; 0%), near-complete (1–10%), major (11–
35%), minor (36–65%), minimal (66–95%), or none
(96–100%). Loss of CCR was defined as >0% Ph-positive cells that was confirmed by repeat analysis 1
month later. Loss of a near-complete cytogenetic
response was an increase in Ph-positive cells to
>10% that was confirmed by repeat analysis 1 month
later.

* Loss of MMR was associated with repeated dose interruptions and decrease in the dose of imatinib
to 200 mg.

Safety was assessed by the incidence of serious
adverse events and the incidence of grade 3 and 4
toxicities. Adverse events were graded in accordance
with the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National
Cancer Institute (version 2.0) (NCI CTC). Tolerability
was assessed by the number of patients who withdrew consent or discontinued imatinib due to toxicity. Dosage increases to 600 mg/day were permitted
for loss of cytogenetic response or loss of molecular
response as defined by a >10-fold increase in BCRABL/BCR%. Imatinib treatment was withheld or the
dosage reduced if a patient experienced a hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or 4 that required therapy or
induced clinical signs or symptoms. If a patient
experienced a nonhematologic toxicity of grade 3 or
4 for >2 days, imatinib treatment was withheld until
the toxicity had resolved to less than grade 3. Imatinib treatment was resumed at 50% of the dose taken
when the grade 3 toxicity developed. The dose was
gradually increased if the toxicity remained at
<grade 2 for 4 weeks or longer. For a hematologic
toxicity, if a patient had an absolute neutrophil
count <0.5 3 109 L21 or a platelet count <20 3
109 L21, imatinib treatment was withheld until the
absolute neutrophil count was 1.0 3 109 L21 and
the platelet count was 30 3 109 L21. Imatinib
treatment was then resumed at a daily dose of 400
mg. If cytopenia recurred, imatinib treatment was
withheld until the hematologic toxicity resolved to
grade 2. The dosage schedule was cautiously
designed for these patients who were already doing

RESULTS
Molecular Response
At the screening assessment, 16 of the 23 patients
(70%) did not have an MMR before switching to imatinib. The molecular response of these 16 patients to
imatinib treatment is summarized in Table 1. All 16
patients achieved an MMR at a median time of 3
months (range, 3–12 months) after commencing imatinib (Fig. 1A). One patient withdrew consent at 3
months of imatinib treatment after achieving an
MMR. The remaining 15 patients completed the 12month treatment period and 14 maintained their
MMR. The exception was a patient whose BCR-ABL/
BCR% level returned to the screening value after
repeated dose interruptions (totaling 93 days) due to
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, all 16
patients achieved an MMR after switching to imatinib treatment, and 15 achieved a significant reduction in BCR-ABL/BCR% (median, 63-fold) (Table 1).
In contrast, 7 of the 23 patients had an MMR
before switching to imatinib treatment (Fig. 1B). The
median time since commencing IFN-a in these
patients was 6.7 years (range, 3.0–9.0 years), and the
median BCR-ABL/BCR% of the screening samples
was 0.03% (range, 0.01%–0.06%). The MMR was
maintained in all 7 patients throughout the 12month imatinib treatment period (Fig. 1B). The median BCR-ABL/BCR% value at 12 months was 0.01%
(range, undetectable to 0.07%).
During the 12-month assessment period, the
BCR-ABL transcript level of 10 patients became
undetectable at a sensitivity of at least 4.0 log below
the standardized baseline. However, BCR-ABL was
intermittently detectable for 2 of these patients,
which may reflect the varying sensitivity achieved
with each RNA sample.27 Four of the 7 patients with
an MMR at the start of imatinib therapy were among
the 10 patients whose BCR-ABL became undetectable. At 12 months of imatinib treatment, the overall
median BCR-ABL/BCR% value was 0.01% (range,
undetectable to 0.20%). No patient had an imatinib
dose increase due to loss of molecular response.
The significant, rapid reduction in BCR-ABL/
BCR% associated with imatinib treatment was highlighted by the long-term, serial molecular response

5.8 years (range, 2.0–14.3 years). Compared with the
15 patients with a CCR, the 8 patients with a nearcomplete cytogenetic response had a significantly
(P 5 .016) shorter median time since commencing
IFN-a (3.5 years; range, 1.6–4.6 years). These 8
patients achieved a CCR at a median of 4.5 months
(range, 3–9 months) after switching to imatinib treatment. During the 12-month treatment period, none
of the 23 patients lost their CCR. An additional cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 1 patient. Trisomy 8 was present at 9 months and 12 months of
imatinib treatment in 10% and 15% of Ph-negative
cells, respectively. The Ph chromosome was not
detected in any of the 40 cells examined at each
timepoint. No patient had an imatinib dose increase
due to loss of cytogenetic response.

Adelaide and had frequent molecular assessments for

5 had not achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-a
treatment but all rapidly achieved an MMR after
imatinib commenced (Fig. 2). The remaining patient

The 12-month imatinib treatment period was completed by 22 patients (96%); 1 patient withdrew consent after 3 months of imatinib treatment. All
patients initiated imatinib at a dose of 400 mg and
16 patients (70%) remained on 400 mg throughout
the 12-month treatment period. Six patients had an
interruption to the standard dose. For 3 of these
patients, imatinib was ceased on 1 occasion for 3
days, 4 days, and 34 days, respectively, due to indigestion and diarrhea, the patient running out of imatinib, and aches and increased limb spasms (1
patient each). These patients recommenced imatinib
at 400 mg. One patient ceased imatinib on 2 occasions for febrile neutropenia (13 days) and diarrhea
(31 days) and recommenced on 400 mg and 200 mg
of imatinib, respectively. One patient had repeated
dose interruptions totaling 93 days for neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia and recommenced on 300 mg
or 200 mg of imatinib. One patient reduced their
dose to 100 mg for 8 days due to a rash and then
recommenced on 400 mg.
There were no deaths during the study or in the
follow-up period. One patient experienced a serious

imatinib treatment (febrile neutropenia) but made a
complete recovery. Hematologic toxicities of grade 3
severity were reported for 3 patients (2 patients experienced lymphopenia that was not considered clinically
significant and did not require dose adjustment and 1
patient experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and of grade 4 severity for 1 patient (neutropenia).
None of the patients who experienced hematologic
toxicities discontinued from the study.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of
replacing IFN-a with imatinib to treat patients with
chronic phase CML who have had a complete or
near-complete cytogenetic response to IFN-a. The

results demonstrate that IFN-a-responsive patients
can achieve rapid and significant improvements in
molecular response from switching to imatinib, with
a relatively low incidence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic
toxicities. Long-term follow-up is required to assess
the benefit for progression-free and overall survival.
The achievement of an MMR by imatinib-treated
patients is the only molecular response with defined
prognostic significance.14,21 For patients achieving a
CCR by 12 months of first-line imatinib, the progression-free survival was significantly lower for those
achieving an MMR (89%) compared with those not
achieving an MMR (97%) at 54 months from the
initiation of imatinib treatment (P 5 .017).28 Furthermore, the probability of remaining free of progression to advanced phase at 5 years of imatinib
treatment was significantly inferior for those with a
CCR but no MMR (95%) compared with those with

806

both a CCR and MMR (100%) (P 5 .007).14 Therefore,
the IFN-a-responsive patients in our study were
assessed for the achievement or maintenance of an
MMR after switching to imatinib treatment. All 23
patients enrolled in the study either achieved
(n 5 16 patients) or maintained (n 5 7 patients)
MMR after switching to imatinib. Only 1 patient lost
an MMR, and this patient had repeated dose interruptions and dose reduction. To our knowledge, the
molecular response observed in these IFN-a-responsive patients is the best observed for any cohort after
12 months of imatinib treatment. The median BCRABL/BCR% value of 0.01% in the IFN-a-responsive
patients was considerably lower than was achieved
after 12 months of first-line imatinib treatment in a
subset of IRIS trial patients who were tested at the
Adelaide laboratory (median, 0.075%).29
The enhanced molecular responses to imatinib
treatment that were evident in our cohort of IFN-aresponsive patients are anticipated to translate into
improved progression-free survival. Unfortunately,
even patients with good responses to IFN-a show a
slow rate of recurrence and progression of their disease, despite ongoing IFN-a treatment.16,30 The main
requirement for a prolonged survival while receiving
IFN-a treatment was achieving and maintaining a
CCR.16 In our study, 8 of the 23 patients had not
achieved a CCR at 1.6 to 4.6 years after commencing
IFN-a treatment. After switching to imatinib treatment, these 8 patients achieved a CCR at a rapid
rate, which may translate into a significant survival
advantage. Fifteen of the 23 patients in our study
had already achieved a CCR while receiving IFN-a
treatment and switching to imatinib may have
enhanced their chances of maintaining the response,
because patients achieving a CCR while receiving
IFN-a treatment very often fail to maintain a CCR. A
comprehensive assessment of 317 patients who
achieved CCR while receiving IFN-a treatment found
that the probability of loss of CCR was 42% (95% CI,
35%–49%) by 5 years after achieving CCR.16 Of the
patients who lost their CCR, 30% progressed to accelerated phase or blast crisis, which represents
approximately 13% of all patients.16 In contrast, for
patients treated with first-line imatinib in the IRIS
trial, the probability of progression to accelerated
phase or blast crisis by 4 years after achieving CCR
was 0% and the annual progression rate had declined
every year after the first year.14 Furthermore, loss of
CCR among patients treated with IFN-a correlated
with the level of minimal residual disease as measured at the molecular level.30 In a study of 54 IFN-a-

treated patients with a CCR, 13 of 14 patients with
loss of CCR had persistently high levels of minimal
residual disease.30 The significant reduction in the
BCR-ABL level observed in the majority of patients in
the current study after switching to imatinib treatment may contribute toward the maintenance of
CCR in these patients. Indeed, of the 21 patients who
continued imatinib treatment after the initial 12month assessment period, none had lost their CCR
at a median follow-up of 45 months.
Of the 23 patients in the current study, the 7
who achieved an MMR while receiving IFN-a treatment may already have had a very good chance of
achieving prolonged progression-free survival. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the advantage for these
patients in terms of survival without longer followup. However, BCR-ABL levels in 4 of the 7 patients
became undetectable during imatinib treatment.
Recent reports suggest that patients with undetectable BCR-ABL during imatinib treatment may have a
more stable response.31,32 In a study of 59 imatinibtreated patients with a CCR, none of the 16 with
undetectable BCR-ABL lost their CCR, whereas 13 of
the 43 patients (30%) with detectable BCR-ABL did.31
Long-term IFN-a treatment in our cohort of
patients was adequately tolerated. After switching to
imatinib, there were no unexpected safety concerns or
contraindications related to imatinib treatment in these
patients. Consistent with previously published reports
concerning the safety profile of imatinib, a limited
number of patients experienced cytopenias.8,10,12,33
These adverse events were manageable, and the
patients were able to continue their participation in the
study. The Food and Drug Administration has recently
confirmed that imatinib is generally well tolerated in
patients with CML and adverse events rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment.33 No patients discontinued
imatinib treatment due to toxicity.
The results from the current study suggest that
the use of imatinib as the ‘current standard of
care’11,13 could be extended to another subpopulation of patients with CML, namely, those patients
who have been responsive to IFN-a. Previous studies
have established the favorable benefit risk profile of
imatinib treatment in patients with CML who had
failed treatment with IFN-a9,12 or in patients with
newly diagnosed CML.10,14 Our study suggests that
patients who have achieved a complete or near-complete cytogenetic response to IFN-a can improve
their molecular response by switching to imatinib.
The data should help patients who have responded
to IFN-a and their physicians to make evidence-

based decisions regarding the potential benefits and
risks of switching to imatinib.
