Abstract
In the past few years, much effort has been devoted to show
the single-target specificity of nongenotoxic, p53 reactivating
compounds. However, the divergent biological responses
induced by the different compounds, even in the same tumor
cells, demand additional mechanistic insights, whose knowledge may lead to improved drug design or selection of the
most potent drug combinations. To address the molecular
mechanism underlying induction of mitotic arrest versus
clinically more desirable apoptosis, we took advantage of two
MDM2 antagonists, Nutlin-3 and RITA, which respectively
produce these two outcomes. We show that, along with p53
reactivation, the proapoptotic p53-activator HIPK2 is degraded by MDM2 in Nutlin-3–treated cells, but activated by
transiently reduced MDM2 levels in RITA-treated ones. Gainand loss-of-function experiments revealed the functional
significance of MDM2-mediated HIPK2 regulation in cell
decision between mitotic arrest and apoptosis in both types
of p53 reactivation. These data indicate that strategies of p53
reactivation by MDM2 inhibition should also take into
consideration MDM2 targets other than p53, such as the
apoptosis activator HIPK2. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6241–8]

Introduction
Somatic missense mutations in the TP53 gene are present in
f50% of human cancers (1). However, the observation that p53
function is lost in most wild-type p53 (wtp53)-carrying cancers,
due to amplification or overexpression of its negative regulator
MDM2, has rendered the strategy of releasing p53 from MDM2 an
attractive therapeutic target in oncology (2). Indeed, in the past
decade, induction of p53-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells by
exquisitely selective MDM2 inactivation without stimulation of
genotoxic damage has been one of the leading ideas to avoid
unwanted side effects and limit the induction of secondary
cancers resulting from genomic damage (3, 4). Several approaches
have been developed and tested (5), leading to the discovery of
small molecules that can restore p53 function in tumor cells by
targeting MDM2 through different mechanisms, such as inhibition
of MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation of p53, of p53-MDM2 interaction, or of MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (6). Although each

strategy promoted p53 reactivation in tumor cells carrying
wtp53, as predicted, the biological responses were found to be
significantly different. With the exception of hematologic
malignancies, inherently more prone to apoptosis, cells from
solid tumors undergo mitotic arrest or apoptosis depending on
the p53-reactivating compound used (7, 8), suggesting that in
addition to p53 release from MDM2, other mechanisms might be
engaged.
Recently, it has been shown that MDM2 is not only a p53
inhibitor but contributes to modulate the p53-mediated biological
outcome (i.e., mitotic arrest versus apoptosis) to diverse triggering
signals (9). In particular, we have found that the cytostatic response
to mild, presumably reparable DNA damage implies an active
MDM2-mediated inhibition of the p53 apoptotic pathway. This
event is determined by the MDM2-mediated degradation of the
p53 proapoptotic activator HIPK2. In contrast, cell response to
lethal damage is associated with low levels of MDM2 expression
and HIPK2 activation (10). HIPK2 is a multifunctional kinase
that by virtue of protein/protein interaction with a still growing list
of targets and phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine
residues, regulates gene transcription and the response to DNA
damage (11, 12). HIPK2 is one of the kinases that phosphorylates
p53 at Serine 46 (p53Ser46; refs. 13, 14), a posttranslational
modification triggered by severe, presumably irreparable damage
that would lead to apoptosis (15). In addition, HIPK2 can induce
apoptosis in a p53-independent manner by promoting a
phosphorylation-dependent proteasomal degradation of the
antiapoptotic transcriptional corepressor CtBP (16).
Based on the findings described above, we asked whether the
MDM2-mediated regulation of HIPK2 might be involved in cell
decision between mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced by different
MDM2 antagonists. To address this question, we selected two
compounds, which have been extensively characterized both in
tumor cell culture and in vivo tumor xenografts: Nutlin-3, which
mainly induces mitotic arrest in solid tumor–derived cells, and
Reactivation of p53 and Induction of Tumor-cell Apoptosis (RITA),
which preferentially promotes apoptosis in the same tumor cells
(7, 8). Nutlin-3 is a cis-imidazoline analogue that binds MDM2 in
the p53 pocket and inhibits p53 degradation (17) without causing
major conformational changes in the MDM2 molecule and
preserving its E3-ligase activity (18). RITA is a furanic compound,
identified in a cell-based screen, which binds with high affinity to
the p53 NH2-terminal domain. This binding induces a conformational change in p53 that reduces p53-MDM2 interaction and p53
ubiquitylation, leading to p53 accumulation and induction of the
p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (8). Here, we show that the
biological responses induced by these small compounds, above and
beyond their specific ability of releasing p53 from MDM2, include
effects on others MDM2 targets, such as the apoptosis activator
HIPK2.

Cell lines and drug treatments. U2OS, RKO, MCF-7, HCT116, H1299,
SJSA-1, LNCaP, and SHEP cells were maintained in DMEM or RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human embryo kidney

expression was strongly repressed by Nutlin-3 while increased by
RITA, revealing a differential regulation of this apoptosis activator
by the two compounds. This differential regulation of HIPK2 is
p53-dependent because it was not detected in p53-null cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). When normal cells, such as primary
human embryo kidney cells, were subjected to similar treatments,
no effects were induced by RITA, whereas a mild inhibition of cell
proliferation associated with MDM2 induction and HIPK2 reduction
were observed upon Nutlin-3 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2).
HIPK2 depletion by Nutlin-3 is caused by MDM2
up-regulation and contributes to the mitotic arrest. To identify
the mechanism/s of HIPK2 modulation by Nutlin-3, we analyzed
HIPK2 protein and mRNA levels. Because decreased of HIPK2
protein expression was associated with no mRNA modifications
(Fig. 2A), we assessed protein degradation by adding Nutlin-3 in
the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The
pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD was included in the experiment
because HIPK2 can be activated by caspase cleavage (23). HIPK2
reduction was rescued by MG132, whereas no effect was observed
with z-VAD (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Nutlin-3 represses HIPK2
expression by proteasome-mediated degradation.

degradation. A, U2OS cells were treated with Nutlin-3 or its solvent (DMSO),
and RNAs and TCEs were prepared 48 h after treatment. The HIPK2 mRNA
levels were analyzed by Real-time PCR (top ). TCEs were analyzed by WB for
the expression of the indicated proteins (bottom ). B, U2OS cells were treated
with Nutlin-3 (N ) in the presence or absence of MG132 or its solvent (DMSO)
or z-VAD-fmk or its solvent (Methanol ). TCEs were analyzed for HIPK2
expression by WB. C, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with MDM2specific siRNA (MDM2-i ) or Ctr-i and treated with Nutlin-3 or DMSO 24 h after
transfection. The percentages of apoptotic cells were measured by TUNEL
assay 48 h after treatment. Columns, average of three independent experiments;
bars, SD. TCEs were prepared 24 h after treatment and analyzed by WB. D,
U2OS cells were depleted for MDM2 as in C and 24 h after transfection were
treated with Nutlin-3. TCEs were obtained 24 h after treatment and analyzed by
WB for the indicated proteins.

HIPK2, as a MDM2 target other than p53, we selected a set of
wtp53-carrying cell lines derived from solid tumors. We did not
include in our study hematopoietic tumors to avoid pitfalls due to
high intrinsic sensitivity to apoptosis of hematopoietic cells (21).
Consistent with previous reports (7, 8), cells from the same lines
were cell cycle arrested but alive upon Nutlin-3 treatment, while
undergoing cell death upon RITA (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Fig. 1A).
Next, the effects of Nutlin-3 and RITA on the expression of different
known or putative targets were analyzed by Western blot (WB;
Supplementary Fig. S1B; Fig. 1B). As expected, the cleavage of
PARP was present only in the apoptotic, RITA-treated cells; the cell
cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 was strongly induced only in the arrested,
Nutlin-3–treated cells, whereas its amount was reduced, at least
transiently, in the RITA-treated cells, as recently reported (22).
The amount of p53 protein was increased by both compounds,
although to a different degree, depending on the cell line; in
contrast, the amount of MDM2 was strongly increased by Nutlin-3,
as described (17), but transiently repressed by RITA, although with
different kinetics among the cells. Interestingly, an inverse
correlation with MDM2 expression was observed for HIPK2, whose

In response to mild/reparable genotoxic damage, MDM2mediated degradation of HIPK2 is a critical step for induction of
mitotic arrest and protection from apoptosis (10). Although Nutlin3 activates p53 without evidence of genotoxic stress (17), the
associated strong expression of the MDM2 protein that preserves
its E3-ligase activity (18) might be directly responsible for the
degradation of HIPK2, thus promoting the mitotic arrest induced
by Nutlin-3. To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with Nutlin-3
upon depletion of MDM2 by RNAi (MDM2-i). A significantly milder
reduction of HIPK2 expression and a strong induction of apoptosis
were observed in MDM2-i cells compared with control interfered
(Ctr-i) cells (Fig. 2C). These events were associated with induction
of p53Ser46 phosphorylation (p53Ser46P) and repression of CtBP
expression (Fig. 2D), two markers of HIPK2-induced apoptosis
(13, 16), supporting the hypothesis that down-regulation of HIPK2
upon Nutlin-3 treatment is MDM2-dependent and the mitotic
arrest induced by this compound depends on MDM2-mediated
HIPK2 degradation.
MDM2 promotes the degradation of HIPK2 through its
ubiquitylation at lysine residue 1182, whose substitution with
an arginine produced a HIPK2-K1182R mutant resistant to
MDM2-mediated degradation (10). Thus, we tested the effect of
Nutlin-3 on EGFP-tagged wild-type HIPK2 (EGFP-HIPK2) or the
degradation-resistant HIPK2-K1182R mutant (EGFP-K1182R) ectopically expressed in cells at low level. The low level of
expression was required to avoid massive apoptosis by the HIPK2
expression on its own (10). As shown in Fig. 3A, Nutlin-3
promoted the degradation of the endogenous HIPK2 as well as of
the EGFP-HIPK2, but did not reduce the expression of the
MDM2-resistant EGFP-K1182R mutant. In addition, a strong
induction of apoptosis with p53Ser46P and CtBP repression was
induced by Nutlin-3 upon expression of the HIPK2-K1182R
mutant (Fig. 3A and B).

encoding for MDM2 (M2 ) or with the empty control vector (eV ). After 24 h
from transfection, cells were treated with RITA and harvested 24 h after
treatment for TUNEL assay and WB analysis of the indicated proteins. Values of

Taken together, these results indicate that the depletion of
HIPK2 induced by Nutlin-3 shifts the balance toward induction of
mitotic arrest in solid tumor–derived cells.
HIPK2 induction by RITA is caused by MDM2 downregulation and contributes to the apoptotic response. Next,
we investigated the mechanism of HIPK2 induction by RITA by
analyzing HIPK2 mRNA and protein levels. Increased HIPK2
protein expression was associated with no change in mRNA level
(Fig. 4A), supporting a nontranscriptional type of regulation.
We had previously observed that MDM2 depletion by RNAi is
able to increase HIPK2 expression even in the absence of genotoxic
damage (Fig. 2C; ref. 10), suggesting that MDM2 might contribute
to the maintenance of the steady-state level of HIPK2. Because our
original time course analyses performed upon RITA treatment
showed that HIPK2 induction is preceded by a decrease in MDM2
expression (Fig. 1B), we asked whether a causal role might exist
between the transient MDM2 down-regulation and the induction
of HIPK2 expression. Thus, we evaluated the effect of MDM2
overexpression on HIPK2 levels and apoptosis-induction in
RITA-treated cells. Forced expression of MDM2 impaired HIPK2
expression as well as p53Ser46P and induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that the RITA-induced apoptosis might
depend on the MDM2-mediated activation of HIPK2. However,
MDM2 overexpression may protect cells from apoptosis by other
mechanisms, including, of course, direct inactivation of p53 (24).
Although the concomitant RITA treatment should neutralize this
effect, the contribution of MDM2 is difficult to be determined upon
these conditions. Therefore, we directly assessed the role of HIPK2
in the apoptotic response to RITA. Cells were depleted for HIPK2
expression by transient or stable transfection of different
HIPK2-specific RNA-interfering sequences. Although partial, the
HIPK2 depletion was sufficient to inhibit RITA-induced cell death,
long-term colony formation, and p53Ser46P (Fig. 5A–D). Altogether,
these data show that HIPK2 is an indirect target of RITA and this
compound induces apoptosis in solid tumors because it can
activate HIPK2.
Combined treatment with Nutlin-3 and RITA confirmed the
crucial role of HIPK2 in apoptosis induction. Drug combination
are currently regarded as a most efficient strategy in cancer
therapy. Indeed, combination of Nutlin-3 with conventional
anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin, were shown
to improve their therapeutic effect (18, 25). In principle, it might be
expected that combination of different MDM2 antagonists would
improve their therapeutic efficacy. However, given the opposite
effects exerted by Nutlin-3 and RITA on HIPK2, the combination
of the two drugs would not necessarily increase their therapeutic
efficacy. To get clues on this issue, we first treated cells with Nutlin3 and added RITA when HIPK2 was already repressed by the
Nutlin-3 pretreatment. As shown in Fig. 6A an additive effect was
observed on p53 expression. However, RITA treatment could only
partially down-regulate MDM2 and p21WAF1 expression, whose
absolute levels remained significantly higher than in untreated
cells; HIPK2 expression was not detectably recovered and
p53Ser46P was reduced, as shown by the similar intensity of the
p53Ser46P bands, although the amount of total p53 was higher in the
Nutlin-3)RITA–treated cells than in the RITA alone. Eventually, a
reduced amount of apoptosis, relative to RITA treatment alone was
observed upon Nutlin-3)RITA combination. Next, we treated cells
with RITA and added Nutlin-3 after HIPK2 induction by the RITA
pretreatment. An additive effect on p53 expression was present also
upon this combination. However, Nutlin-3 treatment could only

partially increase MDM2 and p21WAF1 expression and partially
inhibit HIPK2. These events were associated with increased amount
of p53Ser46P and apoptotic rate (Fig. 6B), further supporting the
model in which the MDM2-dependent regulation of HIPK2,
determined by the two different MDM2 antagonists, switches the
cell response induced by their p53 reactivation.

Discussion
Restoration of wtp53 function in human tumors by nongenotoxic target-specific drugs is currently regarded as a promising
strategy to improve cancer therapy (26, 27). Despite the significant
advances achieved in the past decade, two main problems remain
unresolved: induction of permanent tumor suppressive effects
(i.e., apoptosis or replicative senescence of tumor cells rather
than transient mitotic arrest) and a sufficient therapeutic window
(i.e., toxicity for tumors but not for normal tissues). In the
present study, we addressed the molecular mechanism underlying
induction of apoptosis versus growth arrest using as a tool two
p53 reactivating compounds that target p53/MDM2 interaction,

but produce different biological effects. According to the
published data, MDM2 antagonists Nutlin-3 and RITA possess
an opposing ability of inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis in
the same solid tumor–derived cells, providing an excellent tool to
experimentally approach the problem. We have recently shown
that the p53 proapoptotic activator HIPK2 is a critical target of
the p53-MDM2 pathway, contributing to a cell decision between
mitotic arrest and apoptosis upon genotoxic damage (10). Based
on these findings, we asked whether HIPK2 might be involved in
the different biological responses induced by Nutlin-3 and RITA,
respectively. Here, we provide evidence for a strong correlation
and a causal link between Nutlin-3–induced mitotic arrest and
HIPK2 down-regulation as well as between RITA-induced apoptosis and HIPK2 induction. In both cases, these opposing effects on
HIPK2 were mediated by MDM2, which is strongly up-regulated
by Nutlin-3, as already well characterized by others (7, 18, 28),
whereas transiently down-regulated by RITA. Altogether, our data
show that the divergent tumor cell response to p53-reactivation
is due, at least in part, to the MDM2-mediated regulation of HIPK2
(Fig. 6C).

By targeting the physical interaction of p53 and MDM2, Nutlin-3
was previously shown to perform various biochemical functions:
(a) by stabilizing p53, it elevates the cellular level of the p53
transcription target MDM2 (17); (b) by binding MDM2, it prevents

different biological outcomes. A, U2OS cells were treated with Nutlin-3, and after

for the indicated proteins (left), whereas cell viability was measured by trypan
blue exclusion 24 h after treatment (right ). Columns, average of three

after 20 h, Nutlin-3 was added. At the indicated times, TCEs were analyzed

after treatment; columns, average of three independent experiments; bars, SD
(right ). The increased amount of cell death measured upon RITA treatments
(compare right panels in A and B, central columns ) is probably due to an
increase solubility of RITA when DMSO is already present in the medium.
C, model summarizing the role of MDM2-mediated regulation of HIPK2 in
response to p53 reactivation by Nutlin-3 and RITA. Left, binding
of Nutlin-3 to MDM2 displaces it from p53, resulting in up-regulation of p53
and MDM2. Increased levels of MDM2 by degrading HIPK2, inhibits its activation
of p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathways, resulting in
mitotic arrest. Right, binding of RITA to p53 displaces it from MDM2 resulting in
up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of MDM2. Reduced levels of
MDM2, by inducing HIPK2, trigger its p53-dependent and p53-independent
apoptotic pathways, resulting in cell death.

the MDM2 association with other factors, such as the hypoxiainducible factor 1a (29) or E2F1 (25, 30); (c) by preserving the E3
ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, it facilitates the degradation of
the p53 inhibitor/regulator, MDM4 (18). The observation that,
despite all these functions, Nutlin-3 induces mitotic arrest in most
cancer cells with wtp53 but fails to induce effective apoptosis in
many of them (7) has suggested that the cell cycle arrest function of
p53 is well-preserved in human cancer but the apoptotic function
may suffer from abnormalities in the downstream p53 signals
(7, 17). This hypothesis led toward the identification of the cancer
phenotypes susceptible to Nutlin-3–induced apoptosis. For example, MDM2 amplification or MDM4 overexpression were shown to
sensitize a few tumor cells to Nutlin-3–induced apoptosis (31–33),
but their role has been not confirmed in other cells (7, 30, 34).
Based on the strong MDM2-mediated inhibition of HIPK2
expression we observed in all the tumor cells we treated with
Nutlin-3, we propose that Nutlin-3 is intrinsically a cell-cycle
arresting molecule in solid tumor–derived cells and that apoptosis
is the atypical response of particularly sensitive cells. This
hypothesis is supported by the results we obtained with the
Nutlin-3 and RITA combination in successive administrations.
Nutlin-3 pretreatment inhibited HIPK2 expression and reduced
RITA-induced apoptosis, whereas the reverse administration
maintained HIPK2 expression and increased p53Ser46P and RITAinduced apoptosis. These results show that the downstream p53
signals required for apoptosis are present and inducible in these
cells when HIPK2 is not suppressed. Furthermore, by analyzing
SJSA-1 and LNCaP cells, two cell lines that were shown to be
sensitive to Nutlin-3–induced apoptosis but resistant to RITA
(Supplementary Fig. S3A; refs. 7, 17), we detected defects in HIPK2
expression or localization (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). These
defects can explain, on one side, the resistance of these cells to
RITA-induced apoptosis and, on the other side, the intrinsic
sensitivity to Nutlin-3 induced apoptosis through mechanisms that
go beyond the simple p53 reactivation, such as the recently
identified aberrant activation of E2F1 (30).
By binding p53, RITA was previously shown to (a) block the p53MDM2 physical interaction and promote p53 accumulation; (b)
inhibit the interaction of p53 with other negative regulators, such
as iASSP and Parc; and (c) activate the transcription of
proapoptotic p53 target genes (8). Here, we show that RITA
activates HIPK2, which triggers apoptosis by phosphorylating p53
at Ser46 and degrading CtBP. Interestingly, p53Ser46P was shown to
change the p53 affinity for different promoters with a shift from
cell cycle arrest–related genes to apoptosis-related ones, favoring
apoptosis (15, 19, 35). This modification of the transcriptional
program is regulated by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1, which promotes
p53 dissociation from iASPP (36, 37). Taken together, these data
provide a mechanistic explanation to the original observation of
RITA-induced inhibition of p53-iASSP interaction.
What remain unclear is the mechanism through which RITA
transiently reduces the level of MDM2 that contribute to HIPK2
induction. We observed that RITA can repress MDM2 driven by a
heterologous promoter as well as the endogenous MDM2
indicating, at least in part, a nontranscriptional type of regulation
(data not shown). This effect is in apparent contrast with the mild
induction of MDM2 expression recently observed by Enge and
colleagues (22) that, however, analyzed only a few time points. We
could reproducibly detect the transient down-regulation of MDM2
by RITA only by analyzing low-density plated cells and numerous
time points. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1B, different kinetics of

HIPK2 Switches Cell Response to p53 Reactivation

MDM2 reduction were observed in the three analyzed cell lines. In
addition, the temporariness of this event is consistent with the fact
that, in spite of down-regulation, MDM2 is required to promote the
degradation of other targets, such as p21 and hnRNPK (Fig. 1B; ref.
22). Of note, these last two targets, in contrast to HIPK2, are not
degraded by the huge amount of MDM2 reached upon Nutlin-3
(Fig. 1B; ref. 22), suggesting a different target specificity of MDM2
upon RITA and Nutlin-3 treatments. Whether this different target
specificity depends on the levels of MDM2, as it was shown for
the monoubiquitination versus polyubiquitination of p53 (38), or
whether other factors are involved, needs to be clarified.
Interestingly, by a computational ‘‘blind docking’’ approach, it has
been found that RITA should bind not only p53 but also MDM2
(39). Whether this latter binding could be experimentally proved
and whether it is responsible for the different target specificity of
MDM2 has to be assessed.
The complex activities and diverse indirect effects of p53reactivating compounds point out that the direct comparison of
the effect of MDM2 antagonists with MDM2 knockout mouse
models might be inappropriate, as recently acknowledged by van
Amerongen and Berns (40). Indeed, the strong up-regulation of
MDM2 and the following degradation of HIPK2 induced by Nutlin-3
treatment, reported here, cannot be compared, for example, with the
knockout of the mdm2 gene in mice followed by inducible expression of wtp53, which produced severe tissue damage (41). In the
absence of MDM2, HIPK2 should be strongly induced, which will
result in significant apoptosis induction in normal tissues. Furthermore, MDM2 down-regulation by RITA is far from a complete
disappearance of the protein and is also transient, which also makes
the comparison with MDM2 knockout model inadequate.
Another consideration that can be derived from our observations concerns the possibility that drugs such as the inhibitors of

MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity (i.e., HLI98) might be therapeutically interesting because of their off-target activities (42). Besides
the fact that HLI98 should not provoke the MDM2-dependent,
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIPK2, the observation that it
can also inhibit the activity of another RING finger E3, Siah1,
recently shown to be a strong inhibitor of HIPK2 stability (43),
opens the possibility of a further, direct activation of HIPK2 by
inhibition of this E3. It would be interesting to evaluate whether
such events contribute to the apoptotic response induced by this
compound (42).
In summary, our data indicate that the biological responses
induced by the MDM2 antagonists Nutlin-3 and RITA, originally
thought to depend on their specific ability of releasing p53 from
MDM2, rely also on the indirect effects they exert on HIPK2. This
may have important implications for the improvement of drug
design or the selection of most potent drug combinations in
anticancer therapy.
