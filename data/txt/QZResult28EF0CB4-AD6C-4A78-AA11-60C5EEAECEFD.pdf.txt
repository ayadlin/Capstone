ABSTRACT
Using miRNA microarray analysis, we identified 31 miRNAs that were significantly
up-regulated or down-regulated in colon cancer tissues. We chose MIR196B, which
was specifically up-regulated in colon cancer, for further study. We identified 18
putative MIR196B target genes by comparing between the mRNAs down-regulated
in MIR196B-overexpressed cells and the assumed MIR196B target genes predicted
by public bioinformatics tools. The association between MIR196B and FAS was
verified in this study. FAS expression was constitutively elevated in normal human
colorectal tissues. However, its expression was often reduced in human colorectal
cancer. The decrease in FAS expression could be responsible for the reduction of
apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. In colorectal cancer tissue, we showed that
MIR196B up-regulation was mutually followed by down regulation of FAS expression.
We also showed that MIR196B directly repressed FAS expression in colorectal cells.
Furthermore, anti-MIR196B up-regulated FAS expression and increased apoptosis in
colorectal cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of MIR196B
modulates apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells by partially repressing FAS expression
and that anti-MIR196B could be a potential candidate as an anti-cancer drug in
colorectal cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

to colorectal cancer risk. Much evidence suggests that
miRNAs are important regulators of oncogenesis [6, 7].
miRNAs are endogenously synthesized, short,
noncoding RNA molecules of approximately 19-24
nucleotides. miRNAs contribute to the post-transcriptional
regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms
by controlling the stability and translation of target
mRNAs [8]. miRNAs contribute to the regulation of
crucial biological processes, such as cell proliferation,
apoptosis, differentiation, and angiogenesis [9]. They are
also implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases as
tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes [10, 11]. Therefore,
characterization of miRNA expression patterns in cancer
cells may have substantial value for disease diagnosis,
prognosis, and therapy [12-14].

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most
common cancers worldwide [1], and the third leading
cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States [2].
Its etiology is very complex and not fully understood.
Numerous epidemiological and biological studies have
suggested that various risk factors, including nutrition,
physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes, play a critical
role in the etiology of CRC [3, 4]. Most sporadic
colorectal cancers are associated with inflammation and
inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) [5]. Several genetic factors, including
microRNAs (miRNAs), are also thought to contribute

mRNA expression
overexpressing cells

The members of the MIR196 gene family
(MIR196A1, MIR196A2, and MIR196B) are transcribed
from three different genes, which are located in homeobox
(HOX) gene cluster regions in humans [15, 16]. The
MIR196A1 gene is located on Chr. 17q21.32 between
the HOXB9 and HOXB10 genes. The MIR196A2 gene is
located between HOXC10 and HOXC9 on Chr. 12q13.13.
The gene for MIR196B is located in an evolutionarily
conserved region between HOXA9 and HOXA10 on Chr.
7p15.2. The mature nucleotide sequences of MIR196A1
and MIR196A2 are identical, whereas mature MIR196B
differs from MIR196A by one nucleotide [16]. Previous
studies suggests that MIR196 may play critical roles in
normal development and cancer pathogenesis by targeting
specific genes [17].
In this study, we measured miRNA expression in
colon cancer tissues and normal colon tissues by miRNA
microarray analysis. We detected 31 microRNAs that
were specifically up-regulated or down-regulated in
colorectal cancer tissues. Of them, MIR196B was chosen
for detailed analysis and further study. mRNA microarray
expression profiles of MIR196B-overexpressing colorectal
cancer cell lines were generated to identify MIR196B
target molecules. The list of MIR196B target genes
was narrowed down by comparison with a database
of candidate target genes predicted by bioinformatics
programs. We identified FAS cell surface death receptor
(FAS, also called Apo1 or CD95) as a MIR196B target
gene in colorectal cancer and verified their association
between MIR196B and FAS in colorectal cancer cells.

MIR196B-

To determine the levels of endogenous MIR196B
in SW480, Caco2, and HT29 cells, we carried out qRTPCR analysis using the total RNA isolated from the three
different cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1C, the MIR196B
level was lowest in Caco2 cells and highest in HT29
cells (Fig. 1C). To identify genes down-regulated by
MIR196B overexpression, pre-MIR196B was transfected
into SW480 and Caco2 cells. Increased expression
of the miRNA 24 h after transfection in SW480 and
Caco2 cells confirmed the transfection efficiency (Fig.
S1A). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for
mRNA expression profiling analysis with the Illumina
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip. We identified 67
genes whose expression was down-regulated 1.5-fold in
cells overexpressing MIR196B (Table S1).

MIR196B target gene identification
To identify MIR196B target genes, we compared the
67 candidate target genes identified by mRNA microarray
analysis with candidate MIR196B target genes predicted
by the TargetScan and miRWalk algorithms. Of the 67
genes, 18 were identified as putative targets of MIR196B
(Table 2). Among them, we focused on FAS gene. To
determine whether the expression levels of FAS in the
colon cancer cell lines are comparable to the levels of
MIR-196B, we carried out qRT-PCR or western blot
analysis using the total RNAs or proteins isolated from
SW480 and HT29 cells. HT29 cells show low FAS mRNA
(Fig. S1B) and FAS (Fig. S1C) expression level compare
to SW480 cells as MIR196B expression relatively higher
in HT29 than SW480 cells. So, FAS expression might
be depend on endogenous MIR196B expression in colon
cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
miRNA expression profiling in colon cancer tissue
We used miRNA microarray analysis to compare the
expression of miRNA precursors in colon cancer tissue
and normal colon tissue. Total RNA for miRNA chip
analysis was obtained from four different patients with
colon cancer. We initially compared miRNA expression
in normal colon tissues and the matched colon cancer
tissues in two independent experiments. We identified 31
miRNAs that were up-regulated or down-regulated more
than two-fold in both independent experiments (Table 1).
The results from the miRNA chip analysis were validated
by qRT-PCR for 11 miRNAs (Fig. 1A). We selected one,
MIR196B, which was up-regulated in human colorectal
cancer tissue, for further investigation in this study (Fig.
1B).

profiling

FAS is a target of MIR196B
We investigated whether MIR196B regulated FAS
mRNA and protein levels in SW480 cells. The FAS mRNA
level was lower (0.66 fold) in SW480 cells transfected
with pre-MIR196B than in un-transfected control cells
(Fig. 2A). FAS protein expression was also downregulated (0.35 fold) in MIR196B-overexpressing cells
(Fig. 2B).
To demonstrate a direct interaction between the
FAS 3′ UTR region and MIR196B, we cloned the WT
FAS 3′ UTR region predicted to interact with MIR196B
into a luciferase vector (Fig. 2D). Luciferase activity
decreased by ~30% when cells were co-transfected
with pre-MIR196B (Fig. 2E). As a control experiment,
we cloned a mutated FAS 3′ UTR sequence lacking ten

Four colon cancer tissue samples and matched normal colon tissue samples were analyzed twice with miRNA
microarray. All differentially expressed miRNA had a q value < 0.01 (false-positive rate). All, except hsamiR-139 and has-miR-375, were up-regulated in colon cancer tissues.
of the complementary bases. As expected, repression of
luciferase activity was abolished when the interaction
between MIR196B and its target 3′ UTR was disrupted
(Fig. 2E). As additional control experiments, MIR1 instead
of MIR196B was co-transfected with the WT and MT
FAS 3′ UTR constructs. Transfection of pre-MIR1 did not
affect the luciferase activity of either construct (Fig. 2E).
These results suggest that MIR196B directly regulates FAS
expression in colorectal cancer cells.

colon tissues by western blot analysis. FAS expression was
down-regulated in all colon cancer tissues when compared
to expression in normal colon tissues (Fig. 2C).

MIR196B down-regulates FAS-mediated caspases
in SW480 cells
To further define the functional interaction between
MIR196B and FAS in SW480 cells, we investigated the
expression of proteins involved in the FAS-mediated
apoptotic pathway, such as active (cleaved) caspase 8
(CASP8) active (cleaved) caspase 3 (CASP3), as well
as the expression of intrinsic apoptosis molecule active
(cleaved) caspase 9 (CASP9) by western blot analysis.

FAS (0.7 fold), CASP8 (0.69 fold), and CASP3 (0.71
fold) expression was markedly down-regulated by
MIR196B transfection (Fig. 3A). These results indicate
that MIR196B regulates FAS-mediated apoptosis by
directly down-regulating FAS in colorectal cancer cells.
We further investigated the expression of FAS, CASP8,
CASP3, and CASP9 by transfection of anti-MIR196B
into SW480 cells (Fig. 3A). FAS and CASP3 expression
did not change after anti-MIR196B transfection. This was
expected because the level of endogenous MIR196B in
SW480 cells was very low, as shown in Fig. 1C. However,
anti-MIR196B transfection increased CASP8 (1.19 fold)
expression slightly. We also investigated the expression
of FasL (also called FASLG or CD95L) in MIR196B- or

anti-MIR196B-transfected SW480 cells (Fig. 3A). FasL
expression in SW480 cells was markedly down-regulated
(0.7 fold) by MIR196B overexpression. However, there
was no statistically significant change in FasL expression
after anti-MIR196B transfection in SW480 cells.
Interestingly, the FasL expression pattern was similar to
the FAS expression pattern. These results suggest that
MIR196B also regulates FasL expression, although we
did not establish this in the present study.

MIR196B directly regulates FAS expression
To further investigate the down-regulation of FAS
by MIR196B, we assessed the expression of FAS and

FAS-mediated active caspases after FAS monoclonal
antibodie (mAb) treatment in SW480 cells. FAS, CASP8,
and CASP3 expression in SW480 cells was up-regulated
(1.21, 1.72 and 1.39 fold, respectively) by FAS mAb
treatment (Fig. 3B). The up-regulation of these proteins
was significantly attenuated by MIR196B (Fig. 3B).
We also assessed the expression of FasL, NF-κB (p65),
and ERK2 in FAS mAb-treated SW480 cells (Fig. 3C).

Whereas FasL expression was up-regulated (1.23 fold) by
FAS mAb treatment, NF-κB and ERK2 expression was
slightly down-regulated (0.9 and 0.72 fold, respectively)
by FAS mAb treatment (Fig. 3C). The up-regulation of
FasL expression was attenuated by MIR196B transfection.
Interestingly, NF-κB and ERK2 levels were upregulated (1.54 and 1.41 fold, respectively) by MIR196B
transfection (Fig. 3C).

of FasL in HT29 cells. FasL expression was markedly
down-regulated (0.61 fold) by MIR196B in HT29 cells.
However, whereas FAS expression was up-regulated by
anti-MIR196B transfection in HT29 cells, FasL expression
(0.98 fold) did not change (Fig. 4A).

The endogenous MIR196B level in HT29 cells was
higher than that in SW480 cells (Fig. 1C). Our results
suggested that anti-MIR196B transfection would upregulate FAS expression in HT29 cells. We investigated
the expression of FAS and FAS-mediated caspases in
MIR196B- or anti-MIR196B-transfected HT29 cells.
As expected, the expression of FAS (1.3 fold), active
CASP8 (1.08 fold), and active CASP3 (1.56 fold) was
up-regulated by anti-MIR196B transfection (Fig. 4A).
As observed in SW480 cells, FAS, CASP8, and CASP3
levels in HT29 cells were markedly down-regulated (0.57,
0.77 and 0.65 fold, respectively) by MIR196B transfection
(Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the pattern of active CASP9
expression after MIR196B and anti-MIR196B transfection
in HT29 cells differed from the pattern in SW480 cells.
CASP9 expression levels were almost unchanged by
MIR196B or anti-MIR196B transfection in SW480 cells
(Fig. 3A), whereas CASP9 expression was remarkably
up-regulated (1.56 fold) and down-regulated (0.7 fold) in
HT29 cells by anti-MIR196B and MIR196B transfection,
respectively (Fig. 4A). We also determined the expression

Effect of MIRI96B on Caspase 3/7 activities
We profiled and quantified, whether MIR196B can
influence the activation of caspase 3/7 activities in SW480

MIR196B overexpression decreased caspase-3/7 activities
in SW480 cells (0.80 fold change, p<0.01) and HT29
cells (0.89 fold change, p<0.05), compared to the mock
condition, respectively.

of apoptotic cells among anti-MIR196B-transfected
HT29 cells was much higher than among mock-treated
cells. Although the ratio was low, the number of apoptotic
cells decreased (P < 0.05) after MIR196B transfection in
SW480 and HT29 cells (Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C). When FAS
mAb was added to SW480 cells, apoptosis increased (Fig.

not changed by MIR196B or anti-MIR196B transfection
in FAS mAb-treated SW480 cells.

We examined the IC50 values of 5-FU using MTT
assay after the cells were exposed to 5-FU. The IC50 of
5-FU for HT29 was 4±0.02 µM/ml. We investigated
whether anti-MIR196B or MIR196B played a functional
role in 5-FU-induced apoptosis. The apoptosis rate was
significantly increased (P < 0.01) in HT29 cells after 5-FU
treatment compared to untreated control cells (Fig. 4C,

target genes in colorectal cancer.
FAS is a death domain-containing member of the
TNF receptor superfamily [25]. FAS plays a central role in
the physiological regulation of apoptosis, and it has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies
[26]. In human cancer, tumor cells tend to downregulate
FAS expression to avoid FAS-mediated apoptosis
signaling [27, 28], particularly in metastatic human
colorectal cancer [29, 30]. We showed that MIR196B
regulates FAS and the FAS-mediated apoptosis pathway
by directly downregulating FAS expression (Figs. 2-4).
These results suggest that MIR196B is a regulator of FASmediated apoptosis in colorectal cancer.
Apoptosis is a distinct cell death program that is
primarily triggered by the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis
pathway. The intrinsic pathway is activated by cytotoxic
stress and is characterized by the release of cytochrome
c from the mitochondria, resulting in the activation of
downstream CASP9 and CASP3 [31]. The extrinsic
pathway is activated by the binding of FasL to FAS,
leading to CASP8 and CASP3 activation, which initiates

DISCUSSION
miRNAs have been implicated as important
regulators of gene expression in a variety of biological
processes in various diseases, as well as in various
diseases as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes [9-11].
Using colon cancer tissues and normal colon tissues,
we identified 31 colon cancer-associated miRNAs by
miRNA microarray analysis and validated the results by
qRT-PCR (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). We selected MIR196B
for further study. MIR196B was up-regulated in human
colorectal cancer tissue (Fig. 1B). Most functional studies
of MIR196B have reported that the miRNA is deregulated
in various leukemias [18-24]. We used mRNA microarray
analysis and bioinformatics tools to identify MIR196B

multiple pro-apoptotic processes [32]. In this study, we
showed that FAS, CASP8, and CASP3 expression in
SW480 and HT29 cells was markedly down-regulated
by MIR196B overexpression and that anti-MIR196B
overexpression restored their expression (Fig. 3A and
4A). As we expected, the effect of anti-MIR196B was
stronger in HT29 cells than in SW480 cells. The latter
expressed lower levels of MIR196B than HT29 cells (Fig.
1C). Extrinsic pathway molecules were down-regulated by
MIR196B in both cell lines, whereas the intrinsic pathway
molecule CASP9 was regulated in a cell-type specific
manner (Figs. 3A and B and 4A). Many miRNAs partially
regulate target gene expression in specific cells or tissues.
FAS was constitutively expressed at high levels in normal
human colon tissues, but its expression was often reduced
in human colorectal cancer tissues. Our results suggest
that the reduction in FAS level was due to increased
MIR196B expression in colorectal cancer. The reduction
in FAS was not sufficient to induce apoptosis in colorectal
cancer cells.
FAS is a critical component of the FAS-mediated
apoptosis pathway and thus an attractive target in cancer
therapy. FAS mAbs could act as effective anticancer
agents by activating FAS-mediated apoptosis, as shown in
the lower panel of Fig. 4B. However, FAS mAb induces
extensive apoptosis in hepatocytes, resulting in lethal
liver damage [33, 34], thus limiting the clinical use of
FAS mAbs for systemic anticancer chemotherapy. As
shown in Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C, MIR196B overexpression
decreased the apoptotic cell ratio in SW480 and HT29
cells, whereas anti-MIR196B transfection increased
apoptosis. These results indicate that MIR196B regulates
the FAS-mediated apoptosis pathway by modulating
FAS expression. Therefore, our results suggest that antiMIR196B is a candidate material for anticancer therapy in
human colorectal cancer. We also carried out the effect of
MIR196B and anti-MIR196B with an anti-cancer agent
5-FU in HT29 cells (Fig. 4C, lower panel). These results
indicated that anti-MIR196B increased the sensitivity of
5-FU, suggest that MIR196B may contribute to chemoresistance in colon cancer.
FasL expression was only observed in colorectal
carcinomas, but FAS was constitutively expressed at high
levels in normal human colon tissues. However, FAS
expression is often reduced in metastatic human colorectal
carcinoma [29, 35]. FasL expression in tumor cells has
been hypothesized as a “FAS counterattack,” by which
tumor cells evade immune destruction by inducing FasLmediated apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [36].
However, this concept is legitimately debated [37, 38].
Interestingly, our results showed that FasL expression in
SW480 and HT29 cells was markedly down-regulated by
MIR196B overexpression (Fig. 3A and 4A). Furthermore,
the up-regulation of FasL induced by FAS mAb treatment
was attenuated by anti-MIR196B overexpression in
SW480 cells (Fig. 3C). The FasL expression patterns in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to MIR196B and anti-MIR196B overexpression
were similar to the FAS expression patterns (Fig. 3A and
C and Fig. 4A). These results emphasizes that MIR196B
regulates FasL expression by an unknown mechanism,
although we did not establish this in the present study.
We measured NF-κB and ERK2 expression after
MIR196B overexpression (Fig. 3C). Whereas FAS and
FasL expression was down-regulated, NF-κB and ERK2
expression was up-regulated by MIR196B (Fig. 3C).
Consequently, we assessed whether MIR196B regulated
cell viability via the NF-κB or ERK2 pathway in SW480
and HT29 cells (Fig. S2). However, we did not find any
evidence in association between MIR196B expression and
cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells.
In summary, we identified 31 miRNAs that were
significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in colorectal
cancer tissues. We investigated one of them, MIR196B,
and identified 18 putative MIR196B target genes. FAS
was verified as MIR196B targets in this study. MIR196B
expression was up-regulated in colorectal cancer tissue,
whereas FAS expression was down-regulated. MIR196B
directly repressed FAS expression in colorectal cells. In
contrast, anti-MIR196B up-regulated FAS expression and
increased apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines. Our
results suggest that up-regulated MIR196B modulates
apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells by partially repressing
FAS expression and that anti-MIR196B could be useful as
an anti-cancer drug in colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
The tissue samples used in this study were provided
by the Biobank of Wonkwang University Hospital, a
member of the National Biobank of Korea. With approval
from the institutional review board and informed consent,
we obtained colon cancer tissue from 14 colon cancer
patients (7 males and 7 females) and rectal cancer tissue
from 2 rectal cancer patients (2 males). The mean ages of
the colon cancer patients and rectal cancer patients were
65.6 years and 72 years, respectively. Four colon cancer
tissue samples and matched normal colon tissue samples
(2 males and 2 females) were used for miRNA microarray
analysis. Three separate colon cancer tissue samples
and matched normal colon tissue samples (1 male and
2 female) were used to validate the miRNA microarray
results. In addition, one separate colon cancer tissue
sample with matched normal colon tissue sample and two
rectal cancer tissue samples with matched normal rectal
tissue samples were used to assess MIR196B expression.
Six separate colon cancer tissue samples and matched
normal colon tissue samples (4 males and 2 females) were
used to analyze FAS protein expression.

Anti-miR miRNA Inhibitor AM17000, Product ID:
AM12946) were commercially synthesized (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) and transfected at 50 nmol/L using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) or siPORT™
NeoFX™ transfection agent (Ambion) according to the
manufacturers’ recommendations. Cells were harvested
24–48 h (for miRNA and mRNA) or 48–72 h (for protein)
after transfection for functional assays, flow cytometry
assays, or RNA/protein extraction.

The human colorectal cancer cell lines SW480,
HT29, and Caco2 were obtained from Korea Cell Line
Bank. SW480 and HT29 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with
10% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere.
Caco2 cells were cultured in Alpha-MEM (HyClone)
supplemented with 20% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere.

mRNA expression profiling of MIR196B target
genes

miRNA expression profiling

SW480 and Caco2 cells were transfected with
MIR196B or MIR1 as a control. Total RNA was isolated
48 h after transfection, amplified, and purified using the
Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions to yield
biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA). Labeled cRNA
samples (750 ng) were hybridized to a HumanHT-12 v4
Expression BeadChip array (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) for 16–18 h at 58°C. The array signal was
detected using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK),
following the instructions in the BeadChip array manual.
Arrays were scanned with an Illumina BeadArray Reader
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Array data
was exported, processed, and analyzed using Illumina
BeadStudio v3.1.3 (Gene Expression Module v3.3.8).
Array data were filtered for a detection p-value < 0.05
(similar to signal-to-noise) in at least 50% samples.

Total RNA (100 ng) was hybridized to an Agilent
Human microRNA Microarray (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). MicroRNA was labeled,
hybridized, and washed following Agilent’s instructions.
Images of hybridized microarrays were acquired with
a DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies),
and the microarray images were analyzed with Feature
Extraction software (Agilent Technologies). The standard
of statistical significance was the corrected ratio of the
hybridization signal intensity in colon tumor tissue to the
hybridization signal intensity in normal tissue.

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After digestion with DNase and
cleanup, RNA samples were quantified, aliquoted, and
stored at -80°C. Total RNA isolated from tissue samples
and/or cultured cells were used as a template to synthesize
cDNA for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis in
a StepOne Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA).
The differential miRNA expression patterns were
validated with the TaqMan qRT-PCR assay (Applied
Biosystems) or the NCode VILO miRNA cDNA Synthesis
kit for qRT-PCR and EXPRESS SYBR GreenER miRNA
qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR with SYBR Green
dye (Applied Biosystems) was used to assess mRNA
expression. RNU48 (for TaqMan qRT-PCR) or 5.8S (for
SYBR qRT-PCR) and GAPDH were used as endogenous
controls for qRT-PCR of miRNA and mRNA, respectively.
Each sample was run in triplicate.

MIR196B target prediction by bioinformatics
methods
The miRNA targets were predicted using the
computer-aided algorithms TargetScan (http://www.
targetscan.org) and miRWalk (http://www.umm.uniheidelberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/index.html).

Plasmid constructions and luciferase assays
Wild-type or mutant fragments of the 3′ untranslated
region (UTR) of FAS containing the predicted binding site
for MIR196B, were amplified by PCR using the primer
set shown in Table S2. The PCR product was cloned into
the pmirGLO Dual-Luciferase miRNA Target Expression
Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
For reporter assays, cells (5 × 104/well) were
seeded in 24-well plates and co-transfected with wildtype or mutant FAS constructs (500 ng/well) or with
50 nM MIR196B or MIR-1 (negative control) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies)
and siPORT™ NeoFX™ Transfection Agent (Ambion),

respectively, according to manufacturers’ instructions.
Firefly and Renilla luminescence was measured 24 h after
transfection using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Non-transfected cells were used for background
subtraction, and the ratio of firefly reporter luminescence
to Renilla reporter luminescence (control) was calculated.
All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
at least three times.

Detection System (Promega). The data were analyzed with
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,
USA).

Viability (MTT) assay
The effect of MIR196B and antisense MIR196B
(anti-MIR196B) on cell viability was evaluated
with the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) assay (M2128; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). SW480 or HT-29 cells (2
× 104 cells/ well) were transfected with 50 nM MIR196B
or anti-MIR196B in a 96-well plate and grown for 72
h. The medium was carefully removed, and cells were
washed twice with 1× PBS. MTT solution (5 mg/ml),
dissolved in culture medium at a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml, was added to each well. The plates were
wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated for another 3 h
at 37°C. The medium was removed, and 100 μl of DMSO
(Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) was
added to solubilize the MTT tetrazolium crystals. Finally,
the solution was agitated with a pipette until no change
in color was observed, and the optical density was read
at 560 nm (OD560) using a GloMax®-Multi+ Detection
System (Promega). The percentage of viable cells was
estimated by comparison with the untreated controls.
At least three independent experiments were performed.
The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values of 5-FU
(F6627, Sigma-Aldrich Co., Missouri, USA) was assessed
by MTT assay. The molar concentration required for 50%
inhibition of cell viability (IC50) was calculated. In the
following experiments, the concentration of 5-FU used
were equal to the IC50 and duration of 5-FU treatment was
72h in HT29 cells.

Antibodies and western blot analysis
SW480 or HT29 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were
seeded in 6-well plates and incubated for 72 h. Whole
cell lysates were prepared by incubation in RIPA buffer
supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture for 30
min at 4°C. Protein was collected by centrifugation at
12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Equal amounts of protein
(50 μg; determined by the Bradford assay) were boiled in
Laemmli buffer, subjected to 12.0% or 15.0% SDS-PAGE,
and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes
were incubated with blocking buffer [5% BSA in TBS
containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T)] for 2 h at room
temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at
4°C with primary antibodies to FAS (G-9), FasL (C-178),
ERK1/2 (H-72), NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
caspase-9 (human specific; #9502), caspase-8 (1C12;
#9746) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA)
and caspase-3 (Enzo Life Sciences) and washed three
times for 10 min per wash with TBS-T. Membranes
were incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit or mouse
IgG secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing three times for 10 min in TBS-T, protein
was detected with ECL solution (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA) and a FluorChem E System (Cell
Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After protein
detection, some membranes were stripped with stripping
buffer for 1 h at room temperature and re-probed with
antibody to GAPDH (0411; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
used as a loading control. Protein expression was
evaluated using ImageJ software (version 1.44; http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html).

Apoptosis analysis (flow cytometry)
Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with
the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich).
Briefly, SW480 or HT29 cells (1 × 105/well or 3 × 105/
well) were seeded in 6-well plates and collected 72 h
after transfection with MIR196B or anti-MIR196B or
control. SW480 cells (3 × 105/well) were also seeded in
6-well plates, cultured 24 h with FAS mAb (anti-FAS/
CD95 monoclonal antibody; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), and
collected 48 h after transfection with MIR196B, antiMIR196B, or control. 5-FU (4µM/ml) was added 10h
after transfection and the cells were incubated for 72 h.
The cells were trypsinized, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in 100 µl 1× binding buffer. To estimate the
apoptotic cell number, cells were double-stained with
annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) solution, incubated
for 20 min on ice, and resuspended in 1× PBS (300 µl).
Samples were then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton

Caspase 3/7 assay
Caspase 3 and 7 activation assays were performed
using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Kit (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 x 104 cells/well
and transfected with MIR196B or control. After 48h of
transfection, Caspase-Glo 3/7 Reagent (100µl) was added
to each well and mixed gently using a plate shaker at 500
rpm for 30 sec. The plate was then incubated at room
temperature for 2 h in the dark. The luminescence of
each sample was measured by using a GloMax®-Multi+
