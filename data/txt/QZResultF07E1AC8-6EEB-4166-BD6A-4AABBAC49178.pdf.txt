Abstract
Malignant tumors of the rectum are treated by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy.
This involves a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and double stranded DNA-break
(DSB)-inducing radiotherapy. Here we explored how 5-FU cooperates with DSBinduction to achieve sustainable DNA damage in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. After
DSB induction by neocarzinostatin, phosphorylated histone 2AX (γ-H2AX) rapidly
accumulated but then largely vanished within a few hours. In contrast, when CRC cells
were pre-treated with 5-FU, gammaH2AX remained for at least 24 hours. GFP-reporter
assays revealed that 5-FU decreases the efficiency of homologous recombination
(HR) repair. However, 5-FU did not prevent the initial steps of HR repair, such as
the accumulation of RPA and Rad51 at nuclear foci. Thus, we propose that 5-FU
interferes with the continuation of HR repair, e. g. the synthesis of new DNA strands.
Two key mediators of HR, Rad51 and BRCA2, were found upregulated in CRC biopsies
as compared to normal mucosa. Inhibition of HR by targeting Rad51 enhanced DNA
damage upon DSB-inducing treatment, outlining an alternative way of enhancing
therapeutic efficacy. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that interfering
with HR represents a key mechanism to enhance the efficacy when treating CRC with
DNA-damaging therapy.

Introduction

5-FU is a base analogue that has been in use as an
anti-cancer drug for nearly five decades [3]. Apart from
CRC, it is used for treating head and neck cancer and
breast cancers and others [3]. 5-FU is metabolized upon
cellular uptake resulting in (a) misincorporation of FdUTP
into DNA, (b) misincoporation of FUTP into RNA and,
(c) FdUMP mediated inhibition of thymidylate synthetase
(TS).
Endogenous (e. g. reactive oxygen species) and
exogenous (e. g. radiation or chemical mutagens) factors
can cause DNA damage, and timely repair of the damaged

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent
cancer type in the world [1] and fourth leading cause of
cancer related deaths [2] . The cornerstone for the current
treatment of rectal cancer, besides surgery, consists in
radiochemotherapy i.e. combining anti-cancer drugs and
ionizing radiation before and after the surgical removal
of the tumor. Radiochemotherapy of colorectal cancers
generally includes 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination
with γ-radiation.

is occurring and on regulatory factors like 53BP1 and
BRCA1 [17, 18]. The fact that many cancers overexpress
components of the HRR machinery [19-23] raises the
possibility of targeting such components for cancer
therapy.
In this study, we show that 5-FU in combination
with neocarzinostatin (NCS) causes more sustained DNA
damage than the single drugs. The combination also
impaired the proliferation of CRC cells more severely than
either drug alone. Furthermore, 5-FU reduced the repair of
double strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination
repair. The Rad51 inhibitor, B02 enhanced the efficacy of
radiomimetic treatment similar to 5-FU, suggesting Rad51
inhibitors as alternative radiosensitizers.

DNA is necessary to maintain genomic stability. Errors
during DNA replication lead to replication fork stalling
and replicative stress, a condition particularly prevalent in
tumor cells [4, 5]. Overexpression or activation of genes
that enhance proliferation, such as cyclin E and Ras [6,
7], or treatment with nucleoside analogs, hydroxyurea, or
5-FU [8-10] further exacerbate this stress condition [11].
Replicative stress represents a challenge to the stability
of the genome; therefore, the identification and resolution
of the damage in a replicating DNA are mandatory for
cell survival. A cell accomplishes this by a complex and
intricate signaling system known as the DNA damage
response (DDR).
The DDR is a coordinated signaling cascade that
is activated upon DNA damage and invokes a variety of
proteins that help the cell to either repair the damaged
DNA or to undergo apoptosis. Two key protein kinases,
ATM and ATR, modulate the activity of a vast variety
of proteins involved in the DDR. ATM primarily deals
with double stranded DNA breaks, while ATR has
been associated with single stranded DNA breaks and
replicative stress signaling [12]. Around 700 substrates
are believed to be phosphorylated by these two master
regulatory kinases [13]. One of the substrates of ATM
is H2AX, a histone H2A variant that constitutes around
10% of the total H2A in a cell [14]. On formation of
DNA double strand breaks (DSB), it is phosphorylated at
Ser139, and this phosphorylated H2AX is referred to as
γ-H2AX.The phosphorylation of H2AX quickly spreads
on the chromatin and can cover mega bases of DNA
adjacent to the site of DNA damage [14].
Recently, studies have been conducted to elucidate
the 5-FU-induced damage signaling in colorectal cancer
derived cell lines. Treatment of HT-29 cells with 5-FU
causes activation of Chk1 and Chk2 by ATR and ATM,
respectively. HCT 116 cells, irrespective of their TP53
status, showed activation of ATM and Chk2; in HCT15
cells ATM was activated on treatment with high doses
of 5-FU [15]. While these studies identified some of the
5-FU-induced damage signaling components, they do not
clarify whether and how 5-FU is capable of sensitizing
CRC cells towards double strand breaks, as resulting from
ionizing radiation. However, such knowledge would be
required to understand how 5-FU and irradiation cooperate
in the clinical situation of neoadjuvant rectal cancer
therapy.
The DDR often triggers repair mechanisms to
remedy DNA damage. DNA double strand breaks are
recognized by the MRN complex, which promotes the
activation of ATM and the phosphorylation of H2AX
and other signaling intermediates. Phosphorylated H2AX
recruits proteins involved in DNA repair [16]. The DNA
double strand breaks can be repaired either by homologous
recombination repair (HRR) or the non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ). The choice of the repair pathway depends
the phase of the cell cycle in which the repair process

γ-H2AX persists in cells treated with 5-FU and
neocarzinostain
To model neo-adjuvant radiochemotherapy in cell
culture, we treated colorectal cancer cells of the line
SW480 or HeLa cells with a combination of the base
analogue 5-FU and the radiomimetic neocarzinostatin
(NCS). We pretreated the cells with 5 µM 5-FU for 24
h followed by addition of 100 ng/ml NCS for 2, 8 and
24 h and immunoblot analysis (Figure 1A-1C). We found
that the combination of 5-FU and NCS led to prolonged
and persistent γ-H2AX accumulation, even 24 h post
NCS treatment. For cells treated with NCS alone, we
observed a spike in the γ-H2AX levels at the 2 h time
point which diminished over time, suggesting the repair
of the damaged DNA (Figure 1B and 1C). Analogous
results were obtained when using additional colorectal
cancer cell lines, i. e. HCT116, SW837 and SW620
(Supplemental Figure S1, A-E). Next, we treated SW480
cells as above for 24 h and then stained γ-H2AX in fixed
cells by immunofluorescence, followed by quantification
of the staining intensity by automated microscopy and
image analysis (Figure 1D). Here again, we found
persistent γ-H2AX when combining 5-FU and NCS.
A similar cooperation was observed when varying the
concentrations of 5-FU (Figure S2A) and NCS (Figure
S2, B-D). These observations raised the question how
5-FU prolongs the DNA damage induced by NCS; we
suspected that 5-FU might interfere with the repair of
double stranded DNA breaks and thereby increase the
toxicity of DSBs. In order to evaluate the effect of 5-FU
and NCS treatment on long term cell proliferation and
survival, we monitored cell clonogenicity using bright
field microscopy along with automated image analysis. As
shown in Figure 1E, combined treatment with 5-FU and
NCS severely reduced overall cell proliferation. On the
other hand, single treatments with 5-FU and NCS allowed

cells to recover upon removal of the drug. This indicated
that the damage induced by the combination of 5-FU and
NCS is severe and more sustainable than upon single drug
treatment.

5-FU does not impair the recruitment of repair proteins,
like RPA2 and Rad51. This suggests that 5-FU-induced
HRR inhibition does not occur through interference with
the early steps of HRR.

Homologous recombination repair is reduced
upon 5-FU treatment

Reduced homologous recombination is not caused
by loss of cells in S or G2 phases of the cell cycle

NCS, like γ-radiation, primarily induces double
strand DNA breaks. The persistent accumulation of
γ-H2AX suggested that 5-FU might interfere with at least
one of the principal repair mechanisms for DSBs, HRR
or NHEJ. To assess this directly, we carried out plasmid
based reporter assays. These assays are based on the repair
of a GFP-encoding DNA upon transfection of reporter
plasmids [24, 25]. Strikingly, we found that 5-FU reduces
homologous recombination repair (Figure 2A-2B). In
contrast, we did not observe any significant change in
NHEJ efficacy upon treatment with either 5-FU or NCS
(Figure 2C-D). We conclude that 5-FU treatment reduces
the efficiency by that a cell carries out HRR, whereas the
mechanisms of NHEJ remain largely unaffected.

Double strand break repair processes are cell cycle
dependent. Most of the NHEJ is restricted to the G1 phase,
while HRR is active in the S and G2 phases [26]. We
therefore assessed whether the reduction in homologous
recombination was a consequence of a shift in the cell
cycle phase distribution upon treatment with 5-FU. To
this end, we performed propidium iodide staining and
flow cytometry of SW480 cells (Figure 4A) and found
that 5-FU actually increases the proportion of cells in
S phase (Figure 4B). This was further confirmed by the
detection of DNA synthesizing cells through 5-ethynyl2’deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation. Indeed, 5-FU
treatment increased the fraction of EdU positive cells
(Figure 4C) This indicated that the observed reduction
in HRR upon 5-FU treatment did not occur due to arrest
of the cells in an unfavorable cell cycle phase. The
accumulation of cells in S phase upon 5-FU treatment is
compatible with active HRR. Nonetheless, 5-FU leads
to a reduction in this repair process, possibly through
interference with DNA polymerization during HRR.

5-FU treatment does not impair recruitment of
RPA2 or Rad51
In principle, impaired factor recruitment could
represent one reason for reduced HRR. One group of such
factors is represented by the RPA complex. We therefore
assessed the recruitment of RPA2, a subunit of the RPA
complex, to see if 5-FU treatment interferes with early
stages of HRR. 5-FU did not impair the recruitment of
RPA2 to the intranuclear structures, as indicated by the
foci formation of RPA2 detected by immunofluorescence
and digital image analysis (Figure 3A and 3B). On the
contrary, treatment with 5-FU and NCS together led
to an increase in RPA2 foci formation 2 h post NCS
treatment. The more pronounced foci formation 2 h post
NCS treatment is in accordance with the extensive DNA
damage induced by 5-FU in combination with NCS. At
longer times post NCS treatment, i. e. 8 and 24 h, cells that
were pretreated with 5-FU showed even more pronounced
RPA2 foci and more discrete colocalization with γ-H2AX
(Supplemental Figure S3 A-C). It can therefore be
concluded that 5-FU does not impair the recruitment of
RPA2. We next investigated the recruitment of Rad51,
a key component of HRR, in response to treatment with
5-FU and NCS (Figure 3C and 3D, and Supplemental
Figure S4). Treatment with NCS alone led to the formation
of Rad51 foci that mostly colocalized with γ-H2AX foci
at 2 h post treatment and increased further at 8 h post
treatment before being reduced to near-background
levels 24 h post treatment. In contrast, treatment with
a combination of 5-FU and NCS gave rise to sustained
Rad51 foci 24 h post NCS treatment. We conclude that

Antagonizing homologous recombination repair
by a Rad51 inhibitor also leads to persistence of
DNA damage
Among the proteins involved in homologous
recombination repair, Rad51 and BRCA2 represent
is a key modulators. As a first step to assess their
importance in CRC, we determined the RNA levels
corresponding to these genes by microarray hybridization
of 181 CRC biopsy samples in direct comparison with
215 normal mucosa biopsies. And indeed, both Rad51
and BRCA2 expression levels were upregulated in the
tumors to a highly significant extent (Figure 5A-5B;
refer Supplemental Table S1 for raw data and patient
characteristics). No significant relation was observed
between the tumor grade, and expression of Rad51 or
BRCA2 (Supplemental Figure S5). The mRNA expression
levels of Rad51 and BRCA2 were highest in S phase of the
cell cycle (Supplemental Figure S6). Since many tumors
contain a high proportion of dividing cells, S-phaseassociated expression may partially explain why Rad51
and BRCA2 levels are high in tumors. In any case, HR
mediators are enhanced in CRCs and may thus support
CRC progression. This prompted us to test whether direct
HR inhibitors may sensitize CRC cells towards DSBs,
as 5-FU does. To this end, we firstly depleted Rad51, a

generated. (C) NHEJ assay in analogy to A. GFP positive cells were measured using a flow cytometer and normalized to the control. Note

principal mediator of HR, and found that this strongly
augmented the levels of γ-H2AX 24 h after NCS treatment
(Figure 5C). Next, we employed the newly developed
Rad51 inhibitor B02 [27]. We treated CRC cells with B02,
with or without co-treatment with NCS and analyzed the
accumulation of γ-H2AX (Figure 5D). We found that cells
treated with B02 and NCS showed a strong accumulation
of γ-H2AX; however, cells treated with B02 alone did so
too. Since it has been previously reported that apoptosis
can cause accumulation of γ-H2AX, we next determined
the extent of B02- induced apoptosis by detecting cleaved
caspase 3. We found that treatment with B02 alone was
sufficient to induce apoptosis (Figure 5). To distinguish
this caspase-mediated γ-H2AX accumulation from
immediate DDR, we inhibited caspase activity by ZVADFMK. On simultaneous treatment of cells with B02 and
ZVAD-FMK, apoptosis was reduced, as seen by lack of
cleaved caspase 3. We now probed for the accumulation
of γ-H2AX under these new conditions and found that
treatment with B02 alone did not lead to any detectable
γ-H2AX accumulation. Importantly however, treatment
with B02 and NCS caused massive γ-H2AX accumulation
similar to the combination of 5-FU and NCS together,
even when the caspases were blocked (Figure 5D). These
results strongly argue that Rad51 inhibition hinders the
repair of ds DNA breaks. This raises the perspective of
using Rad51 inhibitors to radiosensitize rectal cancer cells,
especially in the context of cancer cell resistance towards
5-FU.

proliferation only mildly (Figure 1E), while a combination
of 5-FU and NCS severely impairs it (Figure 1E). These
results can be viewed as evidence that 5-FU-induced
DNA damage is low and does not challenge the cellular
repair machinery with irreparable DNA damage. On the
other hand, the 5-FU-induced reduction in HRR makes it
impossible for the cell to meet the need of repair when
extensive double strand DNA breaks are induced by NCS;
this then results in prolonged DNA damage (Figure 1B1D), and impaired cell proliferation (Figure 1E). This also
suggests that the transient suppression of HRR by 5-FU is
as such well tolerated by tumor cells, but sensitizes them
towards the additional induction of double strand DNA
breaks. Our results also give credence to the presently used
clinical regimen of combining 5-FU based chemotherapy
with radiation.
These results not only provide an explanation
why combining 5-FU with ionizing irradiation in cancer
treatment. On top of this, the findings reported here
suggest an alternative approach to radiosensitization,
especially when cancer cells are found resistant against
5-FU. Resistance gained to 5-FU can be attributed to
multiple actors like overexpression of thymidylate
synthetase (TS) for overcoming the inhibition by 5-FU,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL [28] protecting cells from 5-FU-induced
apoptosis, or lack of mismatch repair (MMR) factors [29].
In such cases, and according to our results, blocking Rad51
by specific inhibitors appears as a valid alternative to
achieve radiosensitization, at least in case of a successful
clinical development of Rad51 inhibitors. In addition,
however, Chk1/Chk2 inhibitors may also turn out suitable
to interfere with HRR and hence for radiosensitization, as
has been reported previously. AZD7762, a Chk1 inhibitor
prevents the formation of Rad51 foci in pancreatic
carcinoma cells [30] and also leads to persistent γ-H2AX
in response to γ-radiation. Rad51 is phosphorylated at Thr
309 by Chk1 [31], facilitating its recruitment to the sites
of DSBs which may explain why Chk1 inhibition reduces
HRR efficiency. Interfering with DNA repair mechanisms
appears to represent a broadly applicable route to improve
cancer therapy, as has been recently reviewed [32]. Along
this line, 5-FU has previously been found to interfere
with additional repair pathways as well, in particular
base excision repair and mismatch repair [33]. Thus, it is
conceivable that 5-FU exerts at least a proportion of its
cytotoxic effects, alone or in combination with additional
therapeutics, by interfering with multiple DNA repair
pathways.
If interfering with HRR radiosensitizes tumor cells,
this raises the question whether the levels and activity
of HRR mediators might serve as predictive markers for
radio- and chemosensitivity. And indeed, our results show
that colorectal cancers express higher levels of Rad51 and
BRCA2 than normal mucosa (Figure 5). This upregulation
can be understood as a compensatory mechanism, selected
for due to generally enhanced spontaneous DNA damage

Discussion
Our results strongly suggest that 5-FU sensitizes
colorectal cancer cells towards double stranded DNA
breaks (DSBs), by interfering with the repair of such
lesions. This finding provides a rationale for the widely
used radiochemotherapy regimen, including 5-FU and
ionizing irradiation, and applied as a neoadjuvant strategy
to treat rectal cancer. Mechanistically, 5-FU interferes with
homologous recombination repair (HRR) but not nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (Figure 2). Although a
majority of 5-FU-treated cells remains in cell cycle phases
where the HRR machinery would be available to the cell
(Figure 4), this repair pathway still fails to eliminate DNA
damage. Indeed, 5-FU-treated cells, when exposed to a
DSB-inducing agent, accumulate RPA2 at the damaged
site (Figure 3), but nonetheless, the lesions persist. We
therefore propose that 5-FU does not block the assembly
of the HRR machinery but instead interferes with the
subsequent steps of HRR. Namely, the polymerization
of DNA in the course of HRR may be hampered by the
misincorporation of 5-FU metabolites (5F-dUTP), or by
perturbing the balance of nucleotide pools through the
inhibition of thymidylate synthetase [3].
Interestingly, we observed that, although 5-FU
interferes with HRR (Figure 2A), it affects long term cell

in most cancer cells [34]. However, it remains to be
determined whether these expression levels in tumor cells
also correlate with the response to radiochemotherapy.
Rad51 overexpression showed inverse correlation with
survival in patients with colorectal cancer and head and
neck cancer perhaps arguing against a direct role in tumor
cell resistance to therapy [35, 36]. However, higher levels
of Rad51 were found to be associated with enhanced
tumor grading of invasive breast ductal breast cancer
[20]. Recently, overexpression of Rad51 was found as a
negative predictive marker for neoadjuvant therapy using
cisplatin/5-FU to treat esophageal cancers again arguing
that high Rad51 levels may confer tumor cell resistance
towards DNA damaging drugs [37].
Taken together, our results point out that we
are already interfering with DNA repair mechanisms
for cancer therapy when using conventional
chemotherapeutics. Apparently, DNA repair is blocked by
5-FU, and this contributes to the success of radiotherapy.
By adding to our understanding on how DNA repair
modulates radio- and chemosensitivity, the development
of more targeted repair inhibitors may enable greater
efficacy and specificity of sensitization. One example for
such a strategy appears to consist in the direct inhibition of
HRR to improve the neoadjuvant therapy of rectal cancer.

gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. For detection of specific proteins, the
membranes were incubated with antibodies diluted in
tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse anti-γ-H2AX (JBW301,

Expression analysis of Rad51 and BRCA2 repair
genes

Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Images were captured with
a Pathway HT Cell Imaging System using the AttoVision
image acquisition software (Becton Dickinson) and the
fluorescence intensity was quantified per nucleus using
the BD Image Data ExplorerTM software.

To validate the clinical relevance of our genes,
we used an in house generated data set (J. Gaedcke). It
is based on 181 rectal tumor biopsies and 181 biopies
of matched normal mucosa tissues analysed on Whole
Human Genome Microarray 4x44K v2 microarrays. Data
were log2 transformed and normalized using quantile
normalization. The genes relevant for this study were
extracted from the complete microarray data by gene
symbol. In case of multiple probes, expression levels
of probes of the same gene were found to be highly
correlated, and the highest expressed probe was used.
Differential expression was compared on the log2
differences of tumour vs. mucosa from the same patients,
using a one-sample t-test. The data are provided in
Supplementary Table 1.

Rad51 foci staining
Cells grown on cover slips were washed once
with cold PBS and fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde/
PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were permeabilised with
0.2% Triton X-100/PBS on ice for 5 min. The cells
were incubated overnight with primary antibodies:
mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-S139-H2AX antibody
(Millipore) at a dilution of 1:300, mouse monoclonal
anti-RAD51 antibody (Abcam 14B4) at a dilution of
1:1000. After being washed three times with cold PBS,
the cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antimouse Alexa-fluor594 (Invitrogen) at a dilution of
1:500 or anti-rabbit Alexa-fluor488 (Invitrogen) at a
dilution of 1:600. The nuclei were counterstained with
4’-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 10ng/ml). Slides
were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was observed with the
Zeiss AxioObserver.Z1 microscope (objectives: ECPlnN
40x/0.75 DICII, resolution 0.44 μm; Pln Apo 63x/1.4Oil
DICII, resolution 0.24 μm; EC PlnN 100x/1.3 Oil DICII,
resolution0.26 μm and filters: Zeiss 43, Zeiss 38, Zeiss
49). Semi-confocal images were obtained using the Zeiss
Apotome, Zeiss AxioCamMRm and Zeiss AxioVision
Software.

Cell synchronization by double thymidine block
For synchronization of cell cultures, thymidine
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium at
a final concentration of 2 mM for 16 h. Thymidine was
washed away by adding pre-warmed culture medium
to the cells for 5 min five times. Subsequently, the cells
were further incubated for 9 h. A second treatment with
2 mM thymidine for 16 h was performed. After washing
away thymidine as before, the cells were released in fresh
culture medium.

Confocal microscopy (RPA2 staining)

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR

Cells were grown on cover slips in 6 well plates
(Becton Dickinson) for 24 h and then treated with 5
µM 5-FU for 24 h followed by treatment with 100 ng/
ml NCS. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS, permeabilised with 0.5 % Triton-X-100 and stained
with the anti RPA2 antibody from Calbiochem (NA18,
Calbiochem). The primary antibody was detected using
anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to AlexaFluor-488
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Counterstaining of
the nuclei was done using Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/mL,
Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Images were captured
with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 meta confocal microscope
(Germany). The RPA2 foci in the nuclei were counted
using the FociCounter software (developed by Anna
Jucha, University of Wrocław, Poland) http://focicounter.
sourceforge.net/.

For mRNA analysis, RNA was isolated from cells
using TRIzol (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). The isolated
RNA was reverse transcribed using 25U M-Mul V
Reverse Transcriptase and random hexameric and oligodT primers. For analysis of cDNA samples, SYBR Green
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies) was used for quantitative
real-time PCR. The following primers were used:
GAPDH, 5′-GAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG-3′
and
5′-CAGAGATGATGACCCTTTTGGCTC-3′;
Rad51, 5′-CAACCCATTTCACGGTTAGAGC-3′ and
5′-GCTTTGGCTTCACTAATTCCCTT-3′;
BRCA2,
5’-GTTGTGAAAAAAACAGGACTTG-3’
and
5’-CAGTCTTTAGTTGGGGTGGA-3’. Data were
normalized to GAPDH. Relative gene expression was
calculated by using the ΔΔCt method.

Statistical analysis
All data are represented as means plus/minus
standard error. Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for
the calculation of p-values. Asterisks indicate significant
