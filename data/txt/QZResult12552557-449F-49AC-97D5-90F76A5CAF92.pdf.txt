Abstract
The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a key regulatory role
in cellular homeostasis. The inhibition of the 26S proteasome
by Bortezomib leads to the accumulation of misfolded
proteins, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress followed
by a coordinated cellular response called unfolded protein
response (UPR). Endoplasmic reticulum stress is also a potent
inducer of macroautophagy. Bortezomib is a selective and
potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome and is approved
for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical trials with
Bortezomib have shown promising results for some types of
cancers, but not for some others, including those of the breast.
In this study, we show that Bortezomib induces the UPR and
autophagy in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, Bortezomib did not induce phosphorylation of PERK, a key initial
step of the UPR. We show that induction of autophagy by
Bortezomib is dependent on the proteasomal stabilisation
of ATF4 and up-regulation of LC3B by ATF4. We show that
ATF4 and LC3B play a critical role in activating autophagy
and protecting cells from Bortezomib-induced cell death.
Our experiments also reveal that HDAC6 knockdown results
in decreased LC3B protein and reduced autophagy. Our work
shows that the induction of autophagy through ATF4 may be
an important resistance mechanism to Bortezomib treatment
in breast cancer, and targeting autophagy may represent a
novel approach to sensitize breast cancers to Bortezomib.

Introduction
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a key regulatory role in
cellular homeostasis through the degradation of multiple proteins
implicated in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. The 26S
proteasomes are multicatalytic protease complexes consisting of a
20S catalytic core and regulatory 19S subunit, responsible for most
nonlysosomal intracellular degradation (1).
The dipeptide boronic acid Bortezomib is a selective and potent
inhibitor of the 26S proteasome that reversibly inhibits the
proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity (1). Preclinical studies
showed a broad antitumor activity of Bortezomib, and numerous
clinical trials are currently investigating its efficacy as a single
agent and in combination with other active antitumor agents

against a variety of malignancies (2). Although Bortezomib is
now approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, clinical
experience with Bortezomib has shown limited activity against
solid tumors, including those of the breast, when used as a single
agent (3).
The inhibition of the 26S proteasome by Bortezomib may lead
to the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in
the endoplasmic reticulum lumen resulting in activation of the
unfolded protein response (UPR), through the action of three key
endoplasmic reticulum–resident transmembrane proteins, PERK,
IRE1, and ATF6 (4–6). PERK is a member of a family of protein
kinases that phosphorylates the a subunit of the cytosolic
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a, resulting in a reduced
global protein synthesis and in a preferential translation of selected
mRNAs including Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4;
refs. 5, 6). ATF4 orchestrates a gene expression program involved in
oxidative stress, amino acid synthesis, differentiation, metastasis,
and angiogenesis known as integrated stress response (5, 6).
The UPR leads to simultaneous activation of both adaptive and
proapoptotic pathways. One of the best characterized of these
pathways is mediated by cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristineprednisone (CHOP; Oncovin)/GADD153 a transcription factor,
regulated by ATF4, which activates the transcription of GADD34,
which interacts with protein phosphatase I to catalyze eIF2a
dephosphorylation (5).
Previous reports have identified endoplasmic reticulum stress
and the eIF2a/PERK pathway as potent inducers of macroautophagy where it promotes cell survival (7, 8); however, the
molecular mechanism is not yet clear (9, 10). Autophagy is an
evolutionarily conserved caspase-independent process, responsible
for the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and
cytoplasmic-damaged organelles (11). Autophagy begins in the
cytoplasm with formation of double membrane vesicles, known as
autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasmic material, including
organelles and fuse with lysosomes where the contents are
degraded by acidic lysosomal hydrolases. Microtubule-associated
protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) is one of the key factors in
autophagosome formation. During autophagy, LC3-I is cleaved
and conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II,
which is associated with the preautophagosomal structures (12).
Although autophagy occurs at basal levels playing a critical role
in maintaining cellular homeostasis, it is also involved in many
physiologic and pathologic processes (12). Recently, autophagy
emerged as a multifunctional pathway activated in response to
microenvironmental stress, intracellular damage caused by hypoxia, chemotherapeutic agents, virus infections, and toxins. Autophagy may also have a role in cell death and, as cancer cells often
develop mutations that confer resistance to apoptosis, nonapoptotic forms of programmed cell death might be target for
novel approaches (11, 12).

It has been shown that autophagy can act as a compensatory
degradation system when the UPS is impaired by genetic mutations in Drosophila, and that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a
microtubule-associated deacetylase that interacts with polyubiquitinated proteins, is an essential mechanistic link in this compensatory interaction. Inhibition of both the proteasome and
HDAC6 by tubacin induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and toxicity in multiple myeloma cells (13–15).
Here, we have investigated the ability of Bortezomib to induce
the UPR and autophagy and their role in resistance to Bortezomib
in MCF7 breast cancer cells. We have identified autophagy as
an important resistance mechanism to Bortezomib treatment
in breast cancer and shown that ATF4 stabilisation is a key
component of this response. Targeting autophagy may represent
a novel approach to sensitize breast cancers to Bortezomib.

Materials and Methods
Cells. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA MB 231 were
provided by Cancer Research UK. Cells were maintained in DMEM (with
4.5 mg/mL glucose) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS, penicillin
(100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), and 4 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Life Technologies).
Compounds. Bortezomib was a gift from Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. MG115, MG132, Thapsigargin, and Tunicamycin were from Calbiochem.

siRNA treatment of cells and transfection procedures. Transfections
of siRNA duplexes diluted to give a final concentration of 20 nmol/L in
Opti-Mem I (Invitrogen Life Technologies) were performed with cells at
30% to 40% confluency using 24 AL Oligofectamine transfection reagent
(Invitrogen).
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in M-PER buffer (Pierce)
supplemented with Complete mini-protease inhibitor cocktail tablets
(Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase/kinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with the
indicated antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse, goat or mouse secondary antibodies (Dako Irc.) were used with
ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize immunoreactive

were analyzed using Summit Version 4.3 software.

Results
Induction of UPR and autophagy in MCF7 breast cancer
cells. Bortezomib increased the phosphorylation of eIF2a and
induced ATF4 protein levels in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1A) and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Also, mRNA levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers including CHOP, GADD34, and SKIP3
were significantly increased in Bortezomib-treated cells in a dosedependent (Fig. 1C) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D) and
followed induction of ATF4, as measured by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qPCR). For example, after 24 hours of treatment
with Bortezomib at the lowest concentration tested (100 nmol/L),
SKIP3 was induced 9-fold, GADD34 was induced 40-fold, and CHOP
was induced 20-fold (Fig. 1C). Bortezomib treatment also induced
protein levels of HIF1a (Fig. 1A and B); however, mRNA levels of
the HIF1a target gene-BNIP3 were only induced 2- to 3-fold
(Fig. 1C) or <50% (Fig. 1D), consistent with previous reports
(17–19) that the form of HIF1a induced by proteasome inhibition is
nonfunctional.
Previously, we identified LC3B a key component of the
autophagosome, as a protein specifically induced by endoplasmic
reticulum stress in an ATF4-dependent manner under severe
hypoxia. We next investigated changes of LC3B expression in MCF7
cells treated with Bortezomib. During Bortezomib treatment,
LC3B protein and mRNA levels increased significantly in a doseand time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, B, C, and D), and there was
an increase in the processed form of LC3B (LC3II), indicative of
increased autophagy, particularly at 12 and 24 hours. Also,
induction of ATF4 and LC3B in a time-dependent manner was
observed in MDA MB 231 cells (Fig. 1B).
Differential effects on ATF4 induction by drugs inducing
UPR. We next compared the effect of Bortezomib induction of the
UPR, ATF4, and LC3B, to other small-molecule inducers
of endoplasmic reticulum and cellular stress. The compounds
tested included the proteasomal inhibitors MG115, MG132, and
Bortezomib, inhibitor of glycosylation Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of
Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum pump Thapsigargin, the
oxidative stress-inducer Arsenite, the hypoxia mimetic compound
CoCl2, and an iron chelator Desferoxamine. Both of the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers (Tunicamycin and Thapsigargin)
induced ATF4 and LC3B; however, the strongest induction of ATF4
occurred in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitors MG115,
MG132, and Bortezomib (Fig. 2A). Although levels of phosphoPERK and phospho-eIF2a were similar for all UPR stimuli (Fig. 2A),
the greater induction of ATF4 suggested that proteasomal
stabilization was the main mechanism of ATF4 up-regulation.
There was no induction of LC3B or ATF4 in cells treated with
Desferoxamine and CoCl2, showing that HIF1a was not involved in
ATF4 and LC3B induction (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the role

Cellular Stress Response in Resistance to Bortezomib

were treated with 100 nmol/L, 1 Amol/L,
and 5 Amol/L of Bortezomib and incubated
at 37jC 5% CO2 for 24 h. Levels of protein

phospho-PERK(Thr980), phospho-eIF2a
(Ser51), eIF2a ATF4, LC3B, and

of HIF1a on the induction of ATF4 and LC3B, MCF7 cells
transfected with RNAi against HIF1a were treated with 100 nmol/L
of Bortezomib for 24 hours. There was no difference in induction of
ATF4 and LC3B between HIF1a knockdown cells and SCR control
(Fig. 2A).
Induction of ATF4 and LC3B by Bortezomib does not
depend on activation of PERK. To directly determine the role of
ATF4 in the cellular response to Bortezomib treatment, we
compared gene expression in ATF4 siRNA and control (SCR)
siRNA–transfected cells treated with Bortezomib (100 nmol/L) for
24 hours. Transient transfection with siRNA duplexes specific to
ATF4 in Bortezomib-treated cells resulted in significantly reduced
mRNA levels of LC3B (51% reduction; P = 0.02) and ATF4 target
gene CHOP (38% reduction) as measured by qPCR (Fig. 2B). Also,
ATF4 knockdown led to a significant reduction in ATF4 and LC3B
protein levels compared with control siRNA (SCR)–transfected cells
(Fig. 2C).

To determine a role of PERK activation versus ATF4 stabilization
in Bortezomib-induced expression of LC3B, we transiently transfected cells with siRNA duplexes specific for PERK. No significant
difference in ATF4 and LC3B protein levels was observed between
PERK siRNA and control (SCR) siRNA–transfected cells treated
with Bortezomib (100 nmol/L) for 24 hours (Fig. 2D) and
phosphorylation of eIF2a was maintained. mRNA levels of CHOP
and LC3B were also not affected by PERK knockdown in
Bortezomib-treated cells as measured by qPCR (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). In contrast, Tunicamycin-treated PERK knockdown cells
showed reduced phosphorylation of eIF2a and reduced protein
levels of ATF4 compared with the control (SCR) Tunicamycin–
treated cells (Fig. 2D).
Increased autophagy in Bortezomib-treated cells is dependent on up-regulation of LC3B by ATF4. We used synthetic
siRNA duplexes to specifically inhibit LC3B expression in
Bortezomib-treated cells and thus block the up-regulation of

autophagy. MCF7 cells transiently transfected with siRNA duplexes,
specific to LC3B, showed a significant reduction in LC3B protein
levels, whereas induction of ATF4 and phosphorylation of eIF2a by
Bortezomib were not affected (Fig. 3A).
To investigate if Bortezomib-induced protein levels of LC3B
contribute to induction of autophagy, we performed immunostaining using an antibody against LC3B to visualize autophagosomes.
MCF7 cells showed an increase in LC3B-positive foci after 24 hours
of treatment with Bortezomib, the hallmark of autophagy, whereas
ATF4 and LC3B knockdown cells failed to induce significant LC3Bpositive foci (Fig. 3B, C, and D).
Cells treated with Bortezomib for 24 hours also showed a
significant increase in lysosomal mass as determined by Lyso-

live cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover LC3B knockdown cells showed a
decrease in the lysosomal compartment compared with SCR
control cells when treated with Bortezomib (100 nmol/L), as
detected by Lysotracker staining (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
HDAC6 is involved in Bortezomib-induced autophagy. As
HDAC6 has emerged as an important factor required for
autophagic degradation in cells with mutated UPS, we investigated
whether HDAC6 was also important for the induction of autophagy
in cells where the proteasome was inhibited by Bortezomib.
HDAC6 knockdown in Bortezomib-treated cells resulted in reduced
LC3B protein levels (Fig. 4A). There was no significant change in
LC3B mRNA levels, and HDAC6 knockdown did not affect

induction of the UPR as measured by mRNA levels of CHOP
(Fig. 4B). In MCF7 cells transiently transfected with siRNA duplexes
specific for HDAC6 and treated with Bortezomib, autophagy levels
were greatly reduced compared with control siRNA-transfected
cells and visualized by LC3B immunostaining (Fig. 4C).
The role of UPR and autophagy in survival of MCF7 cells
treated with Bortezomib. We analyzed the effects of Bortezomib
on viability of MCF7 cells transfected with RNAi specific to LC3B,
ATF4, PERK, or control SCR. The IC50 values for 72-hour treatment
of Bortezomib, evaluated with a dose response assay (Fig. 5A), were
as follows: SCR, 5.7 F 0.1 nmol/L (n = 2); LC3B, 2.9 F 0.1 nmol/L
(n = 2); ATF4, 0.9 F 0.1 nmol/L (n = 2); and siRNA PERK, 5.3 F 0.1
nmol/L (n = 2), showing an increased sensitivity to Bortezomib in
PERK, LC3B, and ATF4 siRNA–transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Next, we
performed an MTS assay using the concentration of 100 nmol/L
Bortezomib, previously used for the functional studies of ATF4
and other UPR markers. In this assay, we confirmed that ATF4
knockdown cells were more sensitive to Bortezomib treatment
(45% F 7.9%, P < 0.0001, at 48 hours and 26.8% F 3.0%, P < 0.0001,
at 72 hours; n = 6) compared with the viability of control siRNA
SCR cells also treated with Bortezomib. They were also more
sensitive to Bortezomib than LC3B (69.4% F 8.7%, P < 0.0001, at
48 hours and 67.9% F 10.2%, at 72-hour viability of siRNA SCR
cells; n = 6) and PERK siRNA–transfected cells (74.9% F 22.1%,
P = 0.04, at 48 hours and 61.1% F 20.1%, P < 0.0003, at 72-hour
viability of siRNA SCR cells; n = 6; Fig. 5B).

The role of HDAC6 on proliferation in MCF7 cells treated with
Bortezomib was assessed in a MTS assay. Cells lacking HDAC6
were significantly more sensitive at 24 hours (65% F 16% viability
of control siRNA SCR cells, P < 0.0001; n = 6) and at 48 hours
(53% F 16% viability of control siRNA SCR cells, P < 0.0001; n = 6)
of Bortezomib treatment (Fig. 5C). MCF7 cells transfected with
siRNA against ATF4, LC3B, and SCR control were counted after
24 hours, 48 hours without any treatment (Fig. 6A), or after
exposure to Bortezomib (Fig. 6B). Cells lacking either LC3B or
ATF4 were significantly more sensitive (79.5% F 2.6%, P = 0.0006,
and 50% F 4%, P < 0.0001 viability of control siRNA SCR–
transfected cells, respectively; n = 3) at 48 hours of Bortezomib
treatment, with the loss of ATF4 resulting in the greatest sensitivity
to Bortezomib (Fig. 6B). Thus, in all assays, ATF4 knockdown
conferred the greatest sensitivity. We also investigated the effect on
proliferation in MB MDA231 cells. The cells were counted after
24, 48, and 72 hours of treatment with Bortezomib (10 nmol/L).
The loss of ATF4 or LC3B lead to a significant increase in
sensitivity to Bortezomib compared with SCR control cells after
24 hours (65% F 3%, P = 0.04, and 47.5% F 2%, P = 0.0024, viability
of control siRNA SCR–transfected cells, respectively; n = 3),
48 hours (34% F 0.6%, P = 0.003, and 18.5% F 1%, P = 0.0006,
viability of control siRNA SCR–transfected cells, respectively;
n = 3), and 72 hours (29.0% F 4.0%, P = 0.02, and 13% F 1%,
P = 0.0006, viability of control siRNA SCR–transfected cells,
respectively; n = 3; Fig. 6C), consistent with the MCF7 results.

Figure 3. LC3B is a rate-limiting factor for the induction of autophagy in MCF7 cells treated with Bortezomib. A, MCF7 cells transfected with RNAi for LC3B and
control (SCR ) were treated with Bortezomib for 24 h. Two different siRNA duplexes against LC3B were used, 2 and 3. Protein levels were measured by immunoblot
analysis using antibodies against phospho-eIF2a (Ser51), ATF4, LC3B, and h-TUBULIN. B, MCF7 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L of Bortezomib for 24 h and
stained with antibody against LC3B. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear counterstaining and Lysotracker staining are shown. C, MCF7 cells transfected with
RNAi against LC3B and control (SCR) were treated with 100 nmol/L of Bortezomib for 24 h and stained with antibody against LC3B. DAPI nuclear counterstaining
is shown. D, MCF7 cells transfected with RNAi against ATF4 and control (SCR) were treated with 100 nmol/L of Bortezomib for 24 h and stained with antibody against
LC3B. DAPI nuclear counterstaining is shown.

patients with metastatic breast cancer using Bortezomib as single
agent (20, 21).
Here, we investigated mechanisms of resistance to Bortezomib
in MCF7 breast cancer cells, which have been previously described
as cells relatively resistant to Bortezomib, and with high
proteasome activity (22). Proteasome inhibition leads to the
accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress (23). Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates
the UPR, a cellular adaptive response that leads to an inhibition of
protein translation through the phosphorylation of eIF2a. In vivo
studies have shown that PERK-eIF2a-ATF4 pathway plays an
important role in tumor development as xenograft tumors derived
from cells with an inactivated PERK-eIF2a-ATF4 are smaller and
grow more slowly than wild-type cells (24). It has been shown that
Bortezomib treatment induces the UPR in myeloma (25) and
pancreatic cells (4, 26), and here, we show that this pathway was
also activated in MCF7 breast cancer cells with induction of ATF4
and ATF4-related genes. ATF4 is a mediator of the integrated stress
response and it plays a key role in regulating the expression of
many genes encoding chaperones, factors involved in amino acid
metabolism and transport and redox homeostasis (6, 27, 28).
Consequently, cells lacking ATF4 showed increased susceptibility
to endoplasmic reticulum and other stressors, including amino
acid deprivation and oxidative stress (27), so there are several

www.aacrjournals.org

possible mechanisms involved in survival. Although we could
detect phosphorylation of eIF2a and PERK in Bortezomib-treated
cells, and with different endoplasmic reticulum stressors, there
was a much stronger induction of ATF4 in cells treated with
proteasomal inhibitors. Furthermore, knockdown of PERK
inhibited induction of ATF4 by other stimuli but not Bortezomib.
Cumulatively, this novel observation indicates that the main
mechanism through which Bortezomib induces ATF4 is protein
stabilization due to the proteasome inhibition, rather than the
activation of PERK.
It has been reported that in pancreatic cells Bortezomib
treatment did not induce phosphorylation of eIF2a, but two other
studies showed that proteasomal inhibitors treatment lead to
autophosphorylation of PERK in a head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma model and eIF2a phosphorylation in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (29, 30), which shows the heterogeneity and complexity
of the UPR in Bortezomib-treated cells. In our study, eIF2a
phosphorylation was induced by Bortezomib in the PERK siRNA–
treated cells, implying another kinase is activated.
Recent findings now suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum
stress is a potent inducer of autophagy, although the mechanism is
not clear (7, 8). Here, we show that Bortezomib induces LC3B, at
both the protein and mRNA level by a mechanism involving ATF4.
Induction of LC3B by ATF4 in Bortezomib-treated cells was

independent of PERK. We also show a novel role for ATF4 in
regulating protein levels of LC3B, which were rate limiting for the
induction of autophagy in Bortezomib-treated cells, and that
autophagy was impaired in cells lacking ATF4.
The UPR is implicated in both a prosurvival response, to
maintain cellular homeostasis, and in apoptotic cell death when
responses are not sufficient to relieve endoplasmic reticulum stress
(31). The loss of ATF4 and LC3B was associated with an increase in
cell death, suggesting that ATF4 and autophagy play a prosurvival
role under Bortezomib treatment. However, the precise mechanism
of Bortezomib-induced endoplasmic reticulum–dependent cell
death is still unclear and likely to be cell type specific (32). Several
studies support the hypothesis that Bortezomib sensitizes cancer
cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress–mediated apoptosis (4, 29).
However, recent findings suggest that massive induction of
endoplasmic reticulum stress response and autophagy, by the
combination of Bortezomib with other stresses, such as hypoxia,
may drive tumor cells into necrosis (32, 33). Interestingly, it was
previously shown that the UPR is also involved in resistance
mechanisms to a variety of agents, including the topoisomerase
inhibitor etoposide (34). Other evidence showed that ATF4 could
be induced by cisplatin and overexpression of ATF4 conferred
cisplatin resistance in cells (35). Furthermore, the UPR has been
shown to induce the multidrug resistance gene 1 in human cancer
cell lines (36).
In our work, we investigated the role of UPR in resistance of
MCF7 cells to Bortezomib, by the induction of prosurvival
pathways that could help to relieve the protein overload.
Stabilization of the ATF4 protein lead to the induction of LC3B;
therefore, we also investigated a role of autophagy in Bortezomib
resistance. LC3B knockdown cells showed impaired autophagy and
were more sensitive to Bortezomib, suggesting that the induction
of LC3B through ATF4 is an important mechanism of Bortezomib
resistance. Cells lacking ATF4 were more sensitive to Bortezomib
than those lacking PERK or LC3B, suggesting that ATF4 plays a key
role in protecting cells from death under Bortezomib treatment,
through additional autophagy-independent mechanisms.
Recent evidence has shown that a proteasome-independent
pathway eliminates unfolded polyubiquitinated proteins, known

as the aggresome pathway, is linked to autophagy. HDAC6, a
microtubule-associated deacetylase, couples misfolded polyubiquitinated proteins to the dynein motor complex, resulting in the
formation of aggresomes and clearance by autophagy (15). It has
been shown that autophagy can act as a compensatory degradation
system when the UPS is impaired by genetic mutations in
Drosophila, and that HDAC6 is an essential mechanistic link in
this compensatory interaction (37). Inhibition of both the
proteasome and HDAC6 by tubacin induced accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins and enhanced toxicity in multiple myeloma
and ovarian cancer cells, although the mechanism linking the two
was not known (38). We have shown that the loss of HDAC6 is
associated with strong reduction of the LC3B protein but did not
have any effect on mRNA levels of LC3B in Bortezomib-treated
cells. Moreover, we observed that HDAC6 knockdown cells were
more sensitive to Bortezomib treatment. This may be directly
linked with the down-regulation of LC3B in cells lacking HDAC6
but requires further study. From a clinical point of view, it would
be an attractive possibility to target UPR in combination with
Bortezomib to enhance the response of breast cancer to
Bortezomib, and sensitize to environmental stress that normally
occurs in solid tumors. Although currently no specific inhibitors of
UPR are clinically available, we are screening for such compounds.
Thus, autophagy and the HDAC6 pathway are important targets
for synergistic therapy and combinations of drugs blocking these
pathways represents a testable approach to sensitize cancer cells
to Bortezomib.
