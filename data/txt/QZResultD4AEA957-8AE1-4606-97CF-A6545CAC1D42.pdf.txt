SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Poorly immunogenic tumor cells evade host immunity and grow even in the presence of an intact
immune system, but the complex mechanisms regulating tumor immunogenicity have not been
elucidated. Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the Hippo pathway in suppressing antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that, in three different murine syngeneic tumor models (B16,
SCC7, and 4T1), loss of the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1 and 2) in
tumor cells inhibits tumor growth. Tumor regression by LATS1/2 deletion requires adaptive
immune responses, and LATS1/2 deficiency enhances tumor vaccine efficacy. Mechanistically,
LATS1/2-null tumor cells secrete nucleic-acid-rich extracellular vesicles, which induce a type I
interferon response via the Toll-like receptors-MYD88/TRIF pathway. LATS1/2 deletion in tumors
thus improves tumor immunogenicity, leading to tumor destruction by enhancing anti-tumor
immune responses. Our observations uncover a key role of the Hippo pathway in modulating
tumor immunogenicity and demonstrate a proof of concept for targeting LATS1/2 in cancer
immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cellular transformation, tumor growth, and metastasis constitute a multistep process that
requires the continuous rewiring of signaling pathways and alterations of the reciprocal
interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, thereby allowing cells to
acquire features to become fully neoplastic and eventually malignant (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). The Hippo pathway has gained great interest in recent years as being
strongly involved in several of these key hallmarks of cancer progression (Harvey et al.,
2013; Moroishi et al., 2015a) and, in general, serves important regulatory functions in organ
development, regeneration, and stem cell biology (Johnson and Halder, 2014; Yu et al.,
2015). The heart of the mammalian Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade involving
mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1; also known as STK4) and MST2 (also
known as STK3) (homologs of Drosophila Hippo), as well as two groups of MAP4Ks
(mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases)—MAP4K1/2/3/5 (homologs of
Drosophila Happyhour) and MAP4K4/6/7 (homologs of Drosophila Misshapen)—and the
large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) and LATS2 (homologs of Drosophila Warts) (Meng et al.,
2016). When the Hippo pathway is activated, MST1/2 or MAP4Ks phosphorylate and
activate the LATS1/2 kinases, which, in turn, directly phosphorylate and inactivate Yesassociated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ; also
known as WWTR1), the two major downstream effectors that mediate transcriptional output
of the Hippo pathway (Hansen et al., 2015). Activation of LATS1/2 kinases (and inactivation
of YAP/TAZ) represents the major functional output of the Hippo pathway.
Previous studies have convincingly established the Hippo pathway as a suppressor signal for
cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, though other studies revealed its oncogenic
functions in certain contexts (Moroishi et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2014). Deletion of MST1/2
in mouse liver results in tissue overgrowth and tumor development, demonstrating the tumor
suppressor function of these kinases (Zhou et al., 2009). Complementarily, overexpression of

YAP in mouse liver also promotes tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis (Camargo et al.,
2007; Dong et al., 2007). These studies have demonstrated an inhibitory role of the Hippo
pathway in tumor initiation. However, effects of the Hippo pathway in tumor growth,
especially in the context of reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and host anti-tumor
immune responses, remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate the role of
the LATS1/2 kinases in the growth of established tumors in the context of anti-tumor
immunity. Surprisingly, inactivation of the “tumor suppressor” LATS1/2 in tumor cells
strongly suppresses tumor growth in immune-competent, but not immune-compromised,
mice due to the induction of host anti-tumor immune responses. Our data indicate a new
paradigm for how tumor immunogenicity is regulated through the Hippo signaling pathway
in tumor cells and also have implications for targeting LATS1/2 in cancer immunotherapy.

LATS1/2 Deletion Enhances Anchorage-Independent Growth In Vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To elucidate the role of the Hippo pathway in anti-tumor immunity, we took advantage of
murine syngeneic tumor models of three different cancer types in three different host genetic
backgrounds; B16-OVA melanoma (B16F10 melanoma expressing ovalbumin [OVA]) in
C57BL/6 mice, SCC7 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in C3H/HeOu mice, and 4T1
breast cancer in BALB/c mice. These syngeneic allograft models have been well
characterized and extensively used to study reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and
host anti-tumor immune responses (Dranoff, 2011; Lei et al., 2016). We have recently shown
that deletion of LATS1/2 almost completely abolished YAP/TAZ regulation by the Hippo
pathway, while deletion of other components had only a partial or minor effect on YAP/TAZ
activity (Meng et al., 2015). Therefore, we deleted LATS1/2 in B16-OVA melanoma cells
using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 genomeediting technology (Ran et al., 2013). We obtained multiple independent LATS1/2 doubleknockout (dKO) clones verified by the lack of protein expression of both LATS1 and LATS2
(Figure 1A). Two different clones generated by two independent CRISPR guide sequences
were used for this study. Because YAP is a direct substrate of LATS1/2, of which
phosphorylation can be readily detected with a phospho-YAP antibody or by mobility shift
on a phos-tag gel, we use YAP phosphorylation status as an indicator of LATS1/2 activity.
We found that YAP phosphorylation levels were regulated in response to LATS1/2-activating
signals in wild-type (WT) B16-OVA cells; however, loss of LATS1/2 abolished YAP
phosphorylation (Figure 1A). Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ by LATS1/2 is known to
promote YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic localization and inactivation (Zhao et al., 2007). Indeed,
YAP/TAZ localized in the cytoplasm in response to filamentous actin disruption (which
activates LATS1/2) in WT B16-OVA cells, yet YAP/TAZ remains localized in the nucleus in
LATS1/2 dKO cells under the same condition (Figure 1B). LATS1/2 inactivation or
YAP/TAZ hyperactivation is known to promote cell growth (Zhao et al., 2008). Although
LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells showed identical growth on regular cell culture plates
compared with WT cells (Figure S1A), LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells showed a significant
increase in anchorage-independent growth in comparison to WT cells, in terms of both
colony number and colony size (Figure 1C). These observations indicate that the Hippo
pathway is still operational in B16-OVA melanoma cells and, in addition, that LATS1/2

deficiency activates YAP/TAZ and can further potentiate anchorage-independent growth of
B16-OVA cells in vitro.

Author Manuscript

We also deleted LATS1/2 in SCC7 squamous cell carcinoma cells and found that LATS1/2
deficiency almost completely blocked YAP phosphorylation (Figure S1B) and YAP/TAZ
cytoplasmic localization (Figure S1C) in response to LATS1/2-activating signals. Notably,
WT SCC7 cells showed high YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of YAP/
TAZ, even in the absence of LATS1/2-activating signals, suggesting high basal LATS1/2
activity in these cancer cells. Loss of LATS1/2 again increased anchorage-independent
growth of SCC7 cells (Figures 1D and S1D). LATS1/2-dependent regulation of YAP
phosphorylation (Figure S1E), YAP/TAZ subcellular localization (Figure S1F), and
anchorage-independent cell growth (Figures 1E and S1G) were similarly observed in 4T1
breast cancer cells. Together, our data demonstrate that deletion of LATS1/2 in tumor cells
promotes anchorage-independent tumor cell growth in vitro.
Loss of LATS1/2 Inhibits Tumor Growth In Vivo

Author Manuscript

To investigate the role of the Hippo pathway in tumor growth in vivo, we subcutaneously
transplanted equal numbers of WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells into the back flanks of
C57BL/6 mice and monitored their growth. Unexpectedly, deletion of LATS1/2 in B16-OVA
cells strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo (Figures 2A and 2B). All mice died before day
22 in the WT B16-OVA-injected group, whereas injection with LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA
cells resulted in tumor-free survival in more than half of the mice (Figure 2C). We confirmed
the growth-suppressive effect of LATS1/2 deletion with an independent clone of LATS1/2
dKO B16-OVA cells (Figure S2A). Next, we examined tumor growth of LATS1/2 dKO and
WT SCC7 squamous cell carcinoma cells in syngeneic C3H/HeOu mice. All mice injected
with the parental SCC7 cells showed aggressive tumor growth (Figures 2D and S2B), and
100% died before day 21 (Figure 2E). In contrast, none of the mice injected with LATS1/2
dKO SCC7 cells developed tumors, and all survived tumor free. In a 4T1 orthotopic allograft
model, 4T1 breast cancer cells grow into solid tumors and can readily metastasize to the
lung, liver, and brain when transplanted into the mammary fat pads of syngeneic BALB/c
mice. Consistently, the parental 4T1 cells developed tumors and metastasized to the lung in
BALB/c mice (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2C). On the other hand, LATS1/2 dKO 4T1 cells
developed little tumors and had no metastasis when allografted in BALB/c mice. Thus,
collectively, our observations indicate that loss of LATS1/2 in tumor cells dramatically
inhibits tumor growth in vivo in multiple types of cancer in different host backgrounds.
Based on the current dogma, these results are totally unexpected, as LATS1/2 kinases
supposedly function as tumor suppressors.

LATS1/2 Deletion Enhances Immunogenicity of Tumor Cells
Since LATS1/2 deletion exerts completely opposite effects on tumor cell growth in vitro and
in vivo (Figures 1 and 2), we hypothesized that host factors may contribute to the apparent
discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo phenotypes of LATS1/2 dKO tumor cells.
Therefore, we examined the histopathology of tumors from allografted mice. We found
massive infiltration of inflammatory cells in LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA melanomas (Figure
3A), as well as in LATS1/2 dKO 4T1 breast cancers (Figure S3A), which were confirmed by

staining with the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 (Figures 3B and S3B). These observations
prompted us to hypothesize that immune cells infiltrate, and thereby eliminate, LATS1/2
dKO tumor cells. Both innate and adaptive immune responses work together to constitute
host anti-tumor immunity, but the adaptive immune system plays a pivotal role in mediating
robust and highly specific immune responses against tumors (Gajewski et al., 2013).
Therefore, we examined host adaptive immune responses against tumor cells. We chose a
B16-OVA melanoma model to explore this, because B16-OVA melanoma cells express a
non-secreted form of chicken OVA as a surrogate tumor antigen that can be conveniently
used to follow immune responses directed against the OVA antigen. In addition, B16-OVA
has been extensively used to study cancer immunity, and many genetically altered syngeneic
mouse C57BL/6 strains are available.

Although WT and LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells showed identical expression of OVA
(Figure 3C), we detected significantly higher levels of serum anti-OVA antibody in mice
injected with LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells (Figure 3D), suggesting an enhanced tumorspecific humoral immune response in the LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA-injected mice. Next, we
examined cellular immune responses. CD8+ T cells isolated from the spleens of LATS1/2
dKO B16-OVA-injected mice produced multiple effector cytokines (Figures 3E and S3C),
indicative of T cell activation. We observed significantly higher CD8+ T cell cross-priming
when mice were injected with LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells (Figures 3F and S3D), and in
addition, lymph node cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVAinjected mice showed a remarkably higher OVA-specific T cell response than did lymph
node cells isolated from the parental B16-OVA-injected mice, as measured by interferon
(IFN)γ production (Figure 3G). These observations suggest that tumor-specific cellular
immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, are induced in mice injected with
LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells. Indeed, CD8+ T cells in LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA-injected
mice possessed OVA-specific cytotoxic activity ex vivo (Figures 3H and S3E) and infiltrated
tumors in vivo (Figures 3I and S3F). Together, the aforementioned data demonstrate that
LATS1/2 deletion in tumor cells stimulate tumor-specific humoral and cellular immune
responses, leading to the establishment of robust anti-tumor immunity.
LATS1/2 Deficiency Enhances Tumor Vaccine Efficacy via Adaptive Immunity

Author Manuscript

Given that LATS1/2 deletion in tumor cells enhances host anti-tumor immune responses, we
hypothesized that LATS1/2-null tumor cells, by stimulating anti-tumor immunity, may
protect the host from challenge with the corresponding LATS1/2 WT tumor cells. To test
this, we performed two sets of experiments: co-injection of LATS1/2 dKO and WT tumor
cells into each side of the same mouse (Figure 4A) or immunization of mice with LATS1/2
dKO tumor cells prior to LATS1/2 WT tumor cell injection (Figures 4B and 4C). Strikingly,
co-injection of LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells significantly suppressed tumor growth of the
co-injected WT B16-OVA cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, immunization of mice with
irradiated LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells, which were viable but unable to proliferate,
strongly inhibited the corresponding LATS1/2 WT tumor growth, whereas immunization
with irradiated parental B16-OVA cells produced a much weaker effect (Figure 4B).
Notably, in our experimental setting, a single dose of tumor vaccination with irradiated WT
B16-OVA cells was not sufficient to extend survival (Figure 4C). In contrast, a single dose of

tumor vaccination with irradiated LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells showed a significant delay
in tumor growth and prolonged survival. Approximately 25% of the mice immunized with
irradiated LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells were tumor free when challenged with WT B16OVA cells. The aforementioned observations suggest that LATS1/2 deficiency renders B16OVA cells highly immunogenic and improves tumor vaccine efficacy. We further confirmed
enhanced anti-tumor immunity by LATS1/2 deletion with a different syngeneic model. C3H/
HeOu mice having rejected LATS1/2 dKO SCC7 cells were resistant to rechallenge with the
parental SCC7 cells (Figure 4D), indicating that these animals have established
immunological memory against the given tumor cells.

Author Manuscript

Next, we tested whether adaptive immunity is required for tumor suppression by LATS1/2
deletion. We subcutaneously transplanted WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells into RAG-1
(recombination activating gene 1) knockout (KO) mice that are immune-compromised due
to the lack of mature T and B cells. LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA tumor cells grew similarly to
WT cells (Figure 4E) and showed comparable mortality (Figure 4F) in the absence of an
adaptive immune system. Consistently, co-injection of LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells failed
to inhibit the corresponding LATS1/2 WT tumor growth in RAG-1 KO mice (Figure 4G).
Based on the aforementioned data, we conclude that LATS1/2 deletion in tumor cells
enhances immunogenicity and provokes an adaptive immune response to eliminate tumor
cells.
YAP or TAZ Overexpression in Tumor Cells Suppresses Tumor Growth In Vivo

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

YAP and TAZ are the most characterized downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway.
LATS1/2 cells directly phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on multiple serine residues, leading to
cytoplasmic retention, degradation, and thereby inactivation of YAP/TAZ. Because we
observed high YAP/TAZ activation in LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA tumors in vivo (Figures S4A
and S4B), we examined whether YAP/TAZ hyperactivation phenocopies the effect of
LATS1/2 deletion in tumor growth. To this end, we generated B16-OVA cells stably
overexpressing YAP(5SA) or TAZ(4SA). YAP(5SA) and TAZ(4SA) are active mutants of
YAP/TAZ, with the LATS1/2 phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine, thereby unresponsive
to inhibition by LATS1/2. Notably, we observed a mutual inhibition between YAP and TAZ
protein abundance in YAP(5SA)- or TAZ(4SA)-overexpressing B16-OVA cells (Figure
S4C), consistent with the previously described negative-feedback response (Moroishi et al.,
2015b). YAP(5SA)- or TAZ(4SA)-overexpressing B16-OVA cells showed increased
anchorage-independent growth potential in comparison to the control cells in vitro (Figure
S4D), while their tumor growth in vivo was significantly delayed (Figure S4E). We next
investigated whether the effect of YAP(5SA) requires its transcriptional activity. YAP mainly
binds to the TEA domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors (TEAD1–4) to induce gene
expression, and Ser94 in YAP is required for TEAD binding (Zhao et al., 2008). As
expected, mutating Ser94 abolished the ability of YAP(5SA) to induce target gene
transcription (Figures S4F and S4G). Importantly, the TEAD-binding-defective YAP(5SA/
S94A) was unable to suppress B16-OVA tumor growth (Figure S4H), suggesting that tumor
suppression by YAP requires TEAD-dependent transcription. Together, these observations
indicate that hyperactivation of YAP and TAZ significantly, though may not entirely,

contributes to the in vivo tumor growth suppression by LATS1/2 deletion through a
mechanism requiring TEAD-mediated transcription.
Extracellular Vesicles Released from LATS1/2-Null Tumor Cells Stimulate Immune
Responses

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next explored how LATS1/2 deficiency in tumors stimulates host anti-tumor immune
responses. Because we observed a preeminent CD8+ T cell cross-priming in mice injected
with LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells (Figure 3F), we hypothesized that LATS1/2 dKO B16OVA cells stimulate cross-presentation by antigen-presenting cells. To test this, we examined
the effects of LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells on MHC (major histocompatibil ity complex)
class I-restricted cross-presentation using bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) as
antigen-presenting cells. We found that pre-treatment of BMDCs with conditioned medium
from LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells significantly augmented antigen cross-presentation in
comparison to WT conditioned medium (Figure 5A), and consistent with this, LATS1/2
dKO conditioned medium enhanced BMDC activation, as assessed by interleukin (IL)-12
production (Figure 5B). These results imply that factors released from LATS1/2 dKO B16OVA cells activate BMDCs and thereby enhance antigen cross-presentation. Recent studies
have revealed the emerging roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in immune regulation, both
in an immunosuppressive and in an immunostimulatory manner (Robbins and Morelli,
2014). Therefore, we investigated whether EVs secreted from LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells
are capable of stimulating immune responses. We isolated EVs from culture supernatants of
WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA melanoma cells by ultracentrifugation (Figure S5A) and
found that EVs from LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells were more potent than EVs from WT
B16-OVA cells in activating BMDCs, as assessed by IL-12 production in vitro (Figure 5B).
To discriminate EVs from extracellular non-membranous particles that may be enriched by
ultracentrifugation, we treated the culture supernatants with detergent (Triton X-100) prior
to EV purification. The detergent-treated EV pellets failed to activate BMDCs (Figure S5B).
More importantly, LATS1/2 dKO EVs improved the tumor vaccine efficacy of irradiated WT
B16-OVA cells and conferred a strong immunity against tumor challenge in vivo (Figure
5C). Thus, our results show that EVs released from LATS1/2-deficient tumor cells induce
immune responses and are sufficient to render LATS1/2-adequate tumor cells highly
immunogenic.
LATS1/2-Deficient Tumor Cells Secrete Nucleic-Acid-Rich EVs

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the mechanistic basis for immunostimulatory effects of LATS1/2 dKO EVs, we
characterized the nature of EVs released from WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells. We
found that LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells produced slightly more EVs compared with WT
cells, as assessed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (Figures 5D and S6A) as well as by
protein quantification (Figure 5E). We then analyzed the proteome of EVs using quantitative
mass spectrometry. We identified a total of 1,772 proteins in EVs, which showed enrichment
of previously reported exosomal and microvesicle cargo proteins (Figure S6B), supporting
the quality of our EV purification. Most of the protein expression was almost identical
between WT and LATS1/2 dKO EVs, but a subset of proteins were highly elevated in
LATS1/2 dKO EVs (Figure S6C; Table S1). Among the top increased proteins in LATS1/2
dKO EVs were those involved in RNA and nucleic acid binding (Figure S6D). These

observations prompted us to hypothesize that LATS1/2-null tumor EVs contain higher
amounts of nucleic acids, which are previously reported contents of EVs (Yáñez-Mó et al.,
2015) and are also well-known immunostimulators (Junt and Barchet, 2015). Because RNA
is the most abundant nucleic acid in EVs (Robbins and Morelli, 2014), we characterized
total RNA isolated from EVs. We found that RNA contents in LATS1/2 dKO or YAP(5SA)over-expressing EVs were dramatically increased in comparison to WT EVs (Figures 5F and
S6E). The RNAs in EVs were sensitive to single-strand-specific ribonuclease treatment
(Figure S6F). Taken together, our observations suggest a model in which LATS1/2-deficient
tumor cells secrete higher amounts of nucleic-acid-rich EVs that may contribute to the
potent immunostimulatory effects.
EVs from LATS1/2 dKO Tumor Cells Stimulate the Toll-like Receptors-Type I Interferon
Pathway

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To test our hypothesis that nucleic-acid-rich EVs released from LATS1/2-null tumors
stimulate host anti-tumor immunity, we examined whether alterations in the host nucleicacid-sensing pathways impair the tumor-protective effects of LATS1/2 deletion in vivo. Both
microbial (non-self) and self nucleic acids can be recognized by distinct families of pattern
recognition receptors, including endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic nonTLR sensors (Figure S7A). Activation of these pathways results in the production of
inflammatory cytokines as well as type I IFN, which stimulates innate and adaptive
immunity (Junt and Barchet, 2015). We subcutaneously transplanted WT or LATS1/2 dKO
B16-OVA cells into C57BL/6 mice deficient in the following key molecules in the
endogenous nucleic-acid-sensing pathways: MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary
response 88) and TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β, also known
as TICAM1), two adaptor proteins required for TLR signaling; STING (stimulator of
interferon genes, also known as TMEM173), an adaptor protein required for the cGAS
(cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, also known as MB21D1) cytoplasmic DNA-sensing pathway;
and caspase-1 (also known as CASP1), an effector protein involved in IL-1β maturation
under the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) cytoplasmic DNA-sensing pathway. We found that
deletion of MYD88 largely (Figures 6A and S7B), and TRIF deficiency considerably
(Figures 6B and S7C), attenuated the tumor-suppressive effects of LATS1/2 deletion, as
assessed by tumor mortality. In contrast, deletion of STING (Figure 6C) or caspase-1
(Figure 6D) in recipient mice had no effect on tumor protection by LATS1/2 deficiency,
suggesting that the TLRs-MYD88/TRIF nucleic-acid-sensing pathway, not the cytoplasmic
DNA-sensing pathway, is required for immunostimulatory effects of LATS1/2 deletion.

Author Manuscript

Distinct types of TLRs utilize MYD88 or TRIF as adaptor proteins and specifically respond
to a wide range of ligands on the cell surface, as well as in the endosome (Figure S7A). The
endosomal TLRs are intrinsically capable of detecting nucleic acids. We further investigated
which TLR is required for tumor suppression by LATS1/2 loss. Whereas LATS1/2 deletion
in tumors still protected mice from tumor challenge in TLR4 (which senses bacterial
lipopolysaccharides) KO mice (Figure 6E), deletion of TLR7 (which senses single-stranded
RNA) (Figure 6F) or TLR9 (which senses double-stranded DNA) (Figure 6G) in recipient
mice partially, but significantly, impaired tumor protection by LATS1/2 loss. Thus, our data
suggest that multiple TLRs, and probably not a single TLR, cooperatively sense the nucleic-

acid-rich EVs secreted from LATS1/2-null tumors and trigger immune responses through the
MYD88/TRIF signaling pathway.

Author Manuscript

Activation of TLRs-MYD88/TRIF signaling results in pro-inflammatory cytokine
production as well as type I IFN (in particular, IFNα and IFNβ) production, which
stimulates anti-tumor immune responses (Figure S7A). Particularly, type I IFN plays a
central role in anti-tumor immunity by promoting dendritic cell maturation, antigen crosspresentation, and CD8+ T cell clonal expansion (Fuertes et al., 2013). Therefore, we
examined whether host type I IFN signaling is required for establishing host anti-tumor
immunity induced by LATS1/2 dKO tumor cells. To test this, we subcutaneously
transplanted WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells into IFNAR1 (interferon α and β receptor
subunit 1) KO mice that are deficient in a functional type I IFN receptor. We found that loss
of host type I IFN signaling largely obliterated the protective role of LATS1/2 deletion in
tumor growth (Figure 6H) as well as tumor mortality (Figure 6I). Thus, collectively, our data
provide in vivo evidence supporting a model in which EVs secreted from LATS1/2-deficient
tumor cells stimulate the host TLRs-MYD88/TRIF nucleic-acid-sensing pathways to incite
type I IFN signaling and establish robust anti-tumor immunity.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

In this study, we demonstrate that LATS1/2 deletion unmasks a malignant cell’s
immunogenic potential and restrains tumor growth due to the induction of anti-tumor
immune responses. The effects of LATS1/2 deletion on tumor growth are striking insofar as
LATS1/2 dKO completely abolishes the tumor growth potential of SCC7 and dramatically
reduces tumor growth and the metastasis of B16 and 4T1 cells. LATS1/2-null B16
melanomas secrete nucleic-acid-rich EVs that stimulate the host TLRs-MYD88/TRIF-IFN
pathways to induce anti-tumor immunity and the eventual elimination of tumor cells (Figure
7). LATS1/2 deletion similarly stimulates host immune responses in both SCC7 and 4T1
syngeneic models (Figures 4D, S3A, and S3B), though the involvement of EVs has only
been examined in the B16 model in this study.
Dual Functions of LATS1/2 in Cancer

Author Manuscript

It is generally accepted that the Hippo pathway is a tumor suppressor that inhibits
proliferation and survival of normal cells, preventing tumorigenesis (Harvey et al., 2013;
Moroishi et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2014), yet a few studies did suggest an onco-genic role
of the Hippo pathway in certain contexts (Barry et al., 2013; Cottini et al., 2014). We have
analyzed human epidemiological data using the PrognoScan database (Mizuno et al., 2009)
to find any correlation between LATS1/2 mRNA expression levels and patient outcome in
different types of human cancer (Table S2). Among 107 epidemiological datasets available,
26 studies show significant (p < 0.05) correlation between LATS2 mRNA levels and patient
outcome, which includes 17 studies showing better patient survival with low LATS2
expression. Moreover, 12 studies show significant correlation between LATS1 mRNA levels
and patient outcome, which includes 5 studies showing better patient survival with low
LATS1 expression. In addition, low YAP expression predicted worse patient survival in
human colorectal cancer (Barry et al., 2013) and multiple myeloma (Cottini et al., 2014).

Therefore, although YAP/TAZ hyperactivation is frequently observed in human cancers
(Harvey et al., 2013; Moroishi et al., 2015a), the precise role of the Hippo pathway in human
cancer might be context dependent. In this study, we show that deletion of LATS1/2 in tumor
cells strongly suppresses tumor growth in vivo. On the surface, our data cannot be easily
reconciled with the tumor suppressor model of LATS1/2 in the Hippo field.

Author Manuscript

We propose the following model: LATS1/2 suppress tumor initiation as well as inhibit
immunogenicity. These two activities are important for the physiological role of LATS1/2 in
maintaining tissue homeostasis. LATS1/2 normally provide growth-inhibitory signals to the
cells; therefore, they function cell autonomously to limit tissue overgrowth. We also propose
that LATS1/2 suppresses immunogenicity, serving as a built-in mechanism to prevent
overgrowth of undesirable cells at the wrong places in the organism. For example,
inactivation of LATS1/2 is needed to promote cell proliferation during wound healing and
tissue regeneration. However, cells with impaired LATS1/2 activity may over-proliferate and
migrate to the wrong place. Such undesirable cells should be eliminated to maintain tissue
homeostasis and integrity. This can be achieved because inactivation of LATS1/2 in these
cells can induce a strong immune response. Therefore, the immunosuppressive function of
LATS1/2 is consistent with its physiological roles in tissue homeostasis.

In the established tumor cell lines of B16, SCC7, and 4T1, YAP and TAZ are not
constitutively active. In fact, YAP and TAZ are readily regulated (in B16 and 4T1 cells) or
even largely inactive (in SCC7 cells). Therefore, the tumorigenicity of these cancer cell lines
is independent of the Hippo pathway. Nevertheless, deletion of LATS1/2 causes a moderate
increase of anchorage-independent growth of these tumor cells in vitro, consistent with the
growth inhibitory effect of LATS1/2. However, the enhanced immunogenicity unmasked by
the LATS1/2 deletion in these cells can induce strong immune responses and overwhelm any
growth advantage that might be gained due to LATS1/2 deletion, leading to strong inhibition
of tumor growth in the immune-competent mice. The dual functions of LATS1/2 in
suppressing cell growth and immunogenicity can explain previous observations along with
our present data.
Hippo Pathway in Inflammation and Tumor Immunogenicity

Author Manuscript

Our results indicate that inactivation of the Hippo pathway in tumor cells induces host
inflammatory responses. Interestingly, recent studies revealed that the Hippo pathway can
respond to (Nowell et al., 2016; Taniguchi et al., 2015) and mediate (Liu et al., 2016)
inflammatory signals. Our study, together with these recent findings, suggests a reciprocal
interaction between the Hippo pathway and inflammatory responses. LATS1/2-deficient
tumor-derived EVs contain higher amounts of nucleic acids, which stimulate the host TLRsMYD88/TRIF nucleic-acid-sensing pathways, provoking a type I IFN response to establish
robust anti-tumor immunity. Recent studies indicate that tumor cells themselves can produce
type I IFN in response to chemotherapy, thus enhancing anti-tumor immune responses
(Chiappinelli et al., 2015; Sistigu et al., 2014). Because WT and LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA
cells showed similar expression levels of type I IFN genes such as Ifna4 and Ifnb1 (Figure
S7D), it is less likely that type I IFN secreted from LATS1/2-null tumor cells is the main
mechanism conferring the anti-tumor immunity evoked by LATS1/2 deletion. Given that

nucleic-acid-rich EVs from LATS1/2-deficient tumors can stimulate dendritic cells in vitro
(Figure 5B), and that the host TLRs-MYD88/TRIF nucleic-acid-sensing pathways are
required for immunostimulatory effects of LATS1/2 deletion in vivo (Figure 6), we speculate
that host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may be the major source of type I
IFN (Fuertes et al., 2013).

A series of unbiased Hippo pathway interactome studies have linked endosomal
compartments to the Hippo pathway (Moya and Halder, 2014). It is possible that the Hippo
pathway may regulate endocytic trafficking and, therefore, regulate EV biogenesis. Little is
known about the signaling mechanisms involved in EV biogenesis and incorporation of
proteins or nucleic acids into EVs. Given the known effect of YAP on global microRNA
(miRNA) biogenesis (Mori et al., 2014) and the functional importance of miRNA in EVs
(Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015), one may speculate that the effect of YAP/TAZ on miRNA
biogenesis may increase immunogenicity of LATS1/2-null cells. However, we show that
TEAD-mediated transcription is required for tumor suppression by YAP (Figure S4H),
whereas TEAD-dependent transcription is dispensable for YAP-influenced miRNA
biogenesis (Mori et al., 2014). Moreover, LATS1/2 dKO cells do not increase miRNA
contents in EVs (Figure S6E). Therefore, YAP/TAZ hyperactivation suppresses tumor
growth in vivo via a transcription-dependent, but miRNA-biogenesis-independent,
mechanism. The tumor growth suppression by YAP/TAZ overexpression (Figure S4E) is not
as strong as that of LATS1/2 deletion (Figure 2A), suggesting that LATS1/2 may have
additional targets to suppress immune responses. Recent studies revealed new LATS1/2
substrates in spindle orientation (Dewey et al., 2015; Keder et al., 2015). Because
aneuploidy plays a role in tumor immunogenicity (Senovilla et al., 2012), these new
LATS1/2 substrates in spindle regulation could contribute to immunosuppression. Further
investigations delineating the mechanistic link between the Hippo pathway and EV
biogenesis will have important implications in understanding both the basic biology of EVs
and the inflammation provoked by alteration of the Hippo pathway.
Targeting the Hippo Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy

Author Manuscript

Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have provided new therapeutic approaches for
cancer, and several immune checkpoint inhibitors indeed show impressive effects in the
clinic (Sharma and Allison, 2015). However, individual immune response to cancer
immunotherapy often relies on tumor immunogenicity that varies extensively between
different cancer types and different individuals; therefore, immune checkpoint inhibitors
may not work in cases where tumor immunogenicity is intrinsically limited (Pico de Coaña
et al., 2015). Our study revealed that inactivation of LATS1/2 in tumor cells increases tumor
immunogenicity and enhances tumor vaccine efficacy. Therefore, we speculate that
inhibiting LATS1/2 may enhance anti-tumor immune response and, therefore, would be an
attractive approach to treat cancer. Furthermore, LATS1/2 inhibition to improve
immunogenicity of tumor cells may enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. Thus, a
combination of LATS1/2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors would be a novel and
exciting therapeutic approach for poorly immunogenic cancers, especially in cases where
malignancy is driven by oncogenic alterations that leave the Hippo signaling pathway intact.
It is noteworthy that germline or somatic mutations affecting the core components of the

Hippo pathway are uncommon in human cancers (Harvey et al., 2013; Moroishi et al.,
2015a). Therefore, inhibition of LATS1/2 may enhance tumor immunity in most cancer
types. However, the caveat remains that the immune system of mice is considerably different
from that of humans, and whether our findings in mice can directly be translated to humans
remains to be determined. Moreover, the effect of LATS1/2 inhibition as an intervention for
established tumors needs to be explored. Nevertheless, future studies expanding the
therapeutic potentials of the Hippo pathway will have important clinical implications.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Animals—C57BL/6, C3H/HeOu, or BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Myd88, Tlr4, Tlr7, and Tlr9 KO mice were kind gifts
from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Ticam1 (also known as TRIF) KO
mice were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Beutler (University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, TX, USA). Casp1 (also known as Caspase-1) KO mice were kindly provided
by Dr. Richard A. Flavell (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA).
Rag1 KO mice, Tmem173 (also known as STING) KO mice, and OT-I transgenic mice were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Ifnar1 KO mice were purchased from B&K
Universal (East Yorkshire, United Kingdom). These mouse strains were backcrossed for 10
generations onto the C57BL/6 background at the University of California, San Diego.
Mutant mice were bled by the University of California, San Diego Animal Care Program. 7–
12 weeks old mice were used and all animal experiments were approved by the University of
California, San Diego, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
METHOD DETAILS
Cell culture and gene deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 system—All cell lines were
cultured under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. B16-OVA cells (B16F10 cells expressing
ovalbumin) were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, GIBCO), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). SCC7, 4T1, EL4,
bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), mouse primary lymph node cells and CD8+
T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO),
penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml).

LATS1/2-deficient cells were created through the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 system (Ran et al., 2013). We use a transient CRISPR
strategy for the deletion of LATS1/2 to avoid any potential unspecific effects mediated by
stable Cas9/sgRNA genome integration. Cells were transiently transfected with a Cas9 and
single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression plasmid encoding puromycin resistance (PX459;
Addgene plasmid #48139). The CRISPR-transfected cells will thus acquire transient
resistance to puromycin. The guide sequences were designed using the Optimized CRISPR
Design at http://crispr.mit.edu. The guide sequences used are 5′AGACGTTCTGCTCCGAAATC-3′ or 5′-ACGTTTCCATTGGCGAATGA-3′ for mouse
Lats1; 5′-GAGTGTCCAGCTTACAAGCG-3′ or 5′-GCTGGGTGGTGCAAACTACG-3′
for mouse Lats2. Following transfection and transient selection with puromycin for 3 days,
cells were single-cell sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into 96-well plate
without puromycin. Knockout clones were selected by immunoblot analysis for the lack of
LATS1/2 proteins and YAP phosphorylation. We confirmed that LATS1/2 dKO cells were
sensitive to puromycin after expansion, indicating a transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9
system in those cells. Two independent clones were analyzed as indicated and the parental
LATS1/2 WT cells (not transfected with PX459) were used as control.
Retroviral infection—B16-OVA cells stably expressing empty vector, YAP(5SA),
YAP(5SA/S94A), or TAZ(4SA) were generated by retroviral infection. 293 Phoenix
retrovirus packaging cells were transfected with pBABE empty vector, pBABE YAP(5SA),

transfection, retroviral supernatant was supplemented with 5 μg/ml polybrene, filtered
through a 0.45 μm filter, and used for infection. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were
selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin in culture medium.

Immunoblot analysis—Equal amount of protein samples were resolved in SDS-PAGE in
reducing conditions unless otherwise mentioned in the Figure Legends. Antibodies to YAP
(#14074), pYAP (S127 in humans and S112 in mice; #4911), YAP/TAZ (#8418), LATS1
(#3477), CD81 (#10037), and ALIX (#2171) were obtained from Cell Signaling; those to
actin (#ab3280) and ovalbumin (OVA, #ab1221) were from Abcam; those to LATS2
(#A300-479A, also weakly recognize LATS1) were from Bethyl Laboratories; those to
FLOT1 (#610821) and HSP90 (#610418) were from BD Biosciences. The phos-tag
electrophoresis was performed as described previously (Moroishi et al., 2015b). YAP
proteins can be separated into multiple bands in the presence of phos-tag depending on
differential phosphorylation levels, with phosphorylated proteins migrating more slowly.
Where indicated, cells were treated with serum starvation (DMEM or RPMI 1640 without
other supplements), 1 μg/ml Latrunculin B (LatB), or 25 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) for
1 hr before harvest.

Author Manuscript

Immunostaining of cells—Cells were treated with or without 1 μg/ml Latrunculin B
(LatB) for 1 hr before harvest. Cells were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with
4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated
consecutively with primary antibodies to YAP/TAZ (Santa Cruz, #sc-101199) (overnight at
4°C) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat secondary antibodies (for 90 min at room
temperature) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were covered with a
drop of ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) for observation. Cells in five
randomly selected views (~100 cells) were selected for the quantification of YAP/TAZ
localization.

Author Manuscript

Reverse transcription (RT) and real-time PCR analysis—Total RNA (500 ng)
isolated from cells with the use of RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) was reverse-transcribed
to complementary DNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Complementary DNA
was then diluted and used for quantification by real-time PCR, which was performed using
KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and the 7300 real-time PCR system
(Applied Bio-systems). The sequences of the PCR primers (forward and reverse,
respectively) are 5′-GCCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATG-3′ and 5′GAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCG-3′ for mouse Gapdh; 5′AGCTGACCTGGAGGAAAACA-3′ and 5′-GACAGGCTTGGCGATTTTAG-3′ for

were performed concurrently on the same plate as those for the test mRNAs, and results
were normalized by the corresponding amount of Gapdh mRNA.
Soft agar colony formation assay—Each 6-well plate was coated with 1.5 mL of
bottom agar (DMEM or RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 0.5% Difco agar noble). Cells
(5 × 103 cells for B16-OVA and SCC7, 2.5 × 103 cells for 4T1) were suspended in 1.5 mL of
top agar (DMEM or RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 0.35% Difco agar noble) into
each well. Cells were cultured for approximately two weeks and replaced with fresh medium
every three days. Colonies were stained using 0.005% crystal violet in 5% methanol and
quantified using ImageJ software.

Tumor transplantation and immunization—B16-OVA cells (2 × 105) were
subcutaneously transplanted into both back flanks of C57BL/6 mice. Tumor height and
width were measured with a caliper every 2–3 days to calculate tumor volume (= width2 ×
height × 0.523). Mice were sacrificed when tumors reached maximum allowed size (15 mm
in diameter) or when signs of ulceration were evident. Likewise, 1 × 105 of SCC7 cells were
subcutaneously transplanted into both back flanks of C3H/HeOu mice and 2.5 × 105 of 4T1
cells were transplanted into both mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice. For 4T1 lung
metastasis assay, lungs were tracheally injected with India ink 28 days after transplantation,
and then destained in Fekete’s solution to count tumor nodules.

For tumor vaccination experiments, C57BL/6 mice were immunized intradermally at the
base of the tail with irradiated B16-OVA cells (100 Gy, 1 × 106) 12 days prior to challenge
with B16-OVA cells (one time vaccination, without any adjuvant). For immunization with
EVs, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with irradiated B16-OVA cells (100 Gy, 1 × 106) at the
base of the tail and EVs freshly isolated from culture supernatants of B16-OVA cells (6 ×
106) were injected every 3 days (days 0, 3, 6, and 9) into the same place until challenged
with B16-OVA cells at day 12.
Histopathology and immunostaining of tumors—Tumors were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, sectioned with a microtome, and stained
with hematoxylin-eosin according to standard procedures. Immunostaining of tumors was
performed with frozen cryostat sections with PE-conjugated antibodies to CD45
(eBioscience, #12-0451-82).

Measurement of OVA specific antibodies—Serum anti-OVA IgG concentrations were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, half area 96-well plates
(Corning) were coated with 5 μg/ml OVA protein (Worthington Biochemical, #LS003056) in
PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed and then blocked for 3 hr at room temperature
with blocking buffer [1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS], followed by wash and
incubation with serum samples tested at a 1:100 to 1:125,600 dilutions in blocking buffer
overnight at 4°C. Plates were then washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated detecting
antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature for 2 hr. Plates were washed and incubated
with TMB substrate (KPL, #95059-286), and then read at 450 nm and 650 nm after stopping

previously quantified serum to generate a standard curve. Anti-OVA IgG concentrations
were determined from the lowest dilution of serum samples within a standard curve and
reported as U/ml.
Flow cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSRFortessa and results
were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). Cell suspensions were incubated in mouse
Fc block (anti CD16/CD32; BD Biosciences, #553142) prior to staining. Fluorochrome
conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30F-11), CD3e (clone 145-2C11), CD8a (clone 53-6.7),
Granzyme B (clone GB11), and IFNγ (clone XMG1.2) antibodies were used following the
manufacturers protocol. Kb-SIINFEKL-tetramer was used for identifying OVA-specific
CD8+ T cells. Propidium iodide (PI) was used to stain dead cells.

To analyze intracellular cytokine expression, cells were re-stimulated ex vivo with 10 μg/ml
SIINFEKL peptide (AnaSpec, #AS-60193-1) for 5 hr in the presence of protein transport
inhibitor (BD biosciences, #555029) for the last 4 hr. Intracellular cytokine staining was then
performed using Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Biosciences, #554714).

Ex vivo cytotoxicity assay—EL4 cells were pulsed with 8 μg/ml SIINFEKL peptide or
irrelevant peptides for 2 hr at 37°C, and then labeled with 0.25 μM or 2.5 μM CFSE
(carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester; Thermo Fisher Scientific, #C34554) for 10 min at
37°C, respectively. CFSElow (SIINFEKL loaded target) and CSFEhigh (irrelevant peptide
control) EL4 cells were mixed at 1:1 ratio, and then co-cultured with CD8+ T cells isolated
from splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice challenged (or not) with WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA
cells at 8:1 effector to target cell ratio (E:T). CD8+ T cells were isolated using EasySep
Mouse CD8a Positive Selection Kit (STEMCELL, #18753) from pooled splenocytes of 3–4
mice per group for each experiment. The frequencies of CFSElow and CSFEhigh EL4 cells in
CFSE positive fraction were determined by flow cytometric analysis 18 hr after incubation
and the percent of specific killing was calculated. Specific killing (%) = [1−”Sample
ratio”/”Negative control ratio”] × 100; “Sample ratio” = [CFSElow(target)/
CSFEhigh(irrelevant)] value of each samples co-cultured with CD8+ T cells; “Negative
control ratio” = [CFSElow(target)/CSFEhigh(irrelevant)] value of EL4 cells not cultured with
CD8+ T cells.

In vitro cross-presentation assay—For conditioned medium preparation, B16-OVA
cells were seeded on culture plates and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
for 24 hr at 37°C to allow cell attachment. The cells were then washed with PBS, and culture
medium was switched to DMEM without serum. After incubation for 48 hr, conditioned
medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris.
The resulting supernatant was used for the experiment.
Naive CD8+ T cells were isolated from OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic OT-I mice
using EasySep Mouse CD8a Positive Selection Kit (STEMCELL) and labeled with 2 μM
CFSE. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were generated by 6 days of GM-CSF
(20 ng/ml; eBioscience, #14-8331-80) differentiation, and then incubated (or not) for 18 hr
with conditioned medium (10% of the total volume) from WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA

melanoma cells and pulsed with OVA protein (10 μg/ml) for the last 4 hr. The cells were
washed and cultured with CFSE-labeled OT-I CD8+ T cells at 1:1 ratio for 3 days. OT-1 T
cell proliferation was monitored by CFSE dilution using a flow cytometer and a division
index was determined using FlowJo software (Treestar).

Cytokine ELISA—IFNγ or IL-12 levels in culture supernatants were determined by
ELISA. For ex vivo IFNγ production from lymph node cells, draining lymph nodes
(inguinal lymph nodes) were isolated from C57BL/6 mice challenged (or not) with B16OVA cells and cultured with OVA protein (100 μg/ml) for 3 days. For IL-12 production from
BMDCs, BMDCs were generated by 6 days of GM-CSF (20 ng/ml) differentiation and
stimulated (or not) for 18 hr with conditioned medium (10% of the total volume) or EVs
isolated from culture supernatants of equal numbers of WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA cells
(EVs from 2 × 105 cells were used to stimulate 1 × 106 BMDCs). Both cultures were done in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100
mg/ml) under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C, and then aliquots of cell culture
supernatants were used for cytokine ELISA. For cell conditioned medium preparation, B16OVA cells were seeded on culture plates and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS for 24 hr at 37°C to allow cell attachment. The cells were then washed with PBS, and
culture medium was switched to DMEM without serum. After incubation for 48 hr,
conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove
cell debris. The resulting supernatant was used for EV isolation, which is described in the
“EV isolation and analysis” section.

Author Manuscript

IFNγ concentrations were determined using Mouse IFN-gamma DuoSet ELISA (R&D
Systems, #DY485-05) according to a manufacturer’s protocol. For IL-12 ELISA, half area
96-well plates were coated with capture antibody (Purified Rat Anti-Mouse IL-12 p40/p70;
BD Biosciences, #551219) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed and then blocked
for 3 hr at room temperature with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS), followed by wash and
incubation with culture supernatants overnight at 4°C. Plates were then washed and
incubated with biotinylated detection antibody (Biotin Rat Anti-Mouse IL-12 (p40/p70; BD
Biosciences, #554476) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by wash
and incubation with streptavidin–HRP conjugate for 20 min. Plates were washed and
incubated with TMB substrate (KPL, #95059-286), and then read at 450 nm and 650 nm
after stopping the development with 1 M phosphoric acid. Concentrations were determined
by comparison to a standard curve.

EV isolation and analysis—B16-OVA cells were seeded in 150 mm culture plate and
incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 hr at 37°C to allow cell
attachment. The cells were then washed with PBS twice, and culture medium was switched
to 35 mL of DMEM without serum. After incubation for 48 hr, conditioned medium was
collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to thoroughly remove cell debris. The
resulting supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 μm PVDF filter (Millipore,
#SLGV033RB) to remove cell debris and microvesicles (for the detergent treatment
experiment, the resulting flow-through was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4°C
prior to the ultracentrifugation). The flow-through was transferred into ultracentrifuge tubes

(BECKMAN COULTER, #344058) and then ultracentrifuged in a Beckman SW32Ti rotor
at 30,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets were washed with 35 mL of PBS and
then ultracentrifuged again at 30,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C. The resulting EV pellets were
re-suspended in PBS for experimental use. Protein concentrations of EVs were determined
using Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo, #23235). RNA in EVs was isolated using
TRIzol reagents (Thermo, #15596026) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
concentrations were determined using Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies). For
ribonuclease treatment, total RNA isolated from EVs was digested for 30 min at 37°C with
100 μg/ml RNase A (Thermo, #EN0531) in a buffer comprising 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5
mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl. RNA was then resolved in agarose gels in non-denaturing
conditions. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using NanoSight NS300 system
(Malvern Instruments, Ranch Cucamonga, CA, USA) on isolated EVs diluted 5,000-fold
with PBS for analysis.

LC-MS/MS—EV samples were resolved in SDS-PAGE and the gels were cut into three
regions, and then digested with trypsin. Extracted peptides were analyzed using a C18
column and an EASY-nLC-1000 (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a hybrid quadrupoleorbitrap Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A data-dependent, top 50
method was utilized for analysis. The resulting. RAW files were analyzed with Proteome
Discoverer 1.4 and MASCOT. Results were filtered with 1% FDR at the protein level and
exported to our in-house FileMakerPro database iSPEC and analyzed with Align!, which
calculated intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values (Schwanhäusser et al.,
2011) that were used for subsequent analysis. The ratio of the iBAQ values for WT and
LATS1/2 dKO EVs (DKO/WT ratio) in the individual experiments was calculated and
scored according to the following criteria: score 2, > 5-fold; score 1, 5- to 2-fold; score 0, 2to 0.5-fold; score 1, 0.5- to 0.2-fold; and score 2, < 0.2-fold. We then added each scores from
the individual experiments and set the threshold as a score of > 3 for the top 100 most
significantly increased proteins in LATS1/2 dKO EVs. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was
done using the PANTHER program (Mi et al., 2013). Heatmaps were generated using
NetWalker (Komurov et al., 2012).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Figure 5. EVs Released from LATS1/2-Null Tumor Cells Stimulate Host Immune Responses

(A) Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were pretreated with conditioned
medium from WT or LATS1/2 dKO B16-OVA melanoma cells (or control medium) and
pulsed with OVA protein. BMDCs were then subjected to an in vitro cross-presentation
assay using CFSE-labeled CD8+ T cells isolated from OVA-specific T-cell-receptor
transgenic OT-I mice. OT-I CD8+ T cells proliferate when stimulated with OVA antigen via
cross-presentation by BMDCs, resulting in dilution of CFSE content. Representative
histograms of the gated CD8+ T cells are shown in the left panel. The division index was

Figure 7. Proposed Model for the Regulation of Anti-tumor Immunity by the Hippo Pathway in
Tumors

Author Manuscript

Poorly immunogenic tumor cells evade host immune defenses, despite expressing antigenic
neoepitopes. LATS1/2 deletion in tumor cells stimulates nucleic-acid-rich EV secretion,
which induces a type I IFN response via the TLRs-MYD88/TRIF pathway. Type I IFN
stimulates multiple components of host immune responses, including cross-presentation of
tumor-derived antigens by antigen-presenting cells and T cell activation. Activated T cells,
in turn, facilitate tumor-specific responses of cytotoxic T cells and antibody production by B
cells, promoting tumor destruction. Thus, loss of LATS1/2 in tumors leads to the rejection of
both LATS1/2-deficient and LATS1/2-adequate tumor cells by enhancing host anti-tumor
immune responses.
