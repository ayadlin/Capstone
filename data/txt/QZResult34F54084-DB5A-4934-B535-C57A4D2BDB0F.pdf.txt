Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes cancer progression. In addition, Met has been
implicated in resistance of tumors to various targeted therapies such as EGFR inhibitors in lung
cancers, and has been prioritized as a key molecular target for cancer therapy. However, the
underlying mechanism of resistance to Met targeting drugs is poorly understood. Here, we
describe screening of 1310 genes to search for key regulators related to drug resistance to an antiMet therapeutic antibody (SAIT301) by employing a siRNA-based synthetic lethal screening
method. We found that knockdown of 69 genes in Met-amplified MKN45 cells sensitized the antitumor activity of SAIT301. Pathway analysis of these 69 genes implicated FGFR as a key
regulator for anti-proliferative effects of Met targeting drugs. Inhibition of FGFR3 increased target
cell apoptosis through the suppression of Bcl-xL expression, followed by reduced cancer cell
growth in the presence of Met targeting drugs. Treatment of cells with the FGFR inhibitors
substantially restored the efficacy of SAIT301 in SAIT301-resistant cells and enhanced the
efficacy in SAIT301-sensitive cells. In addition to FGFR3, integrin β3 is another potential target
for combination treatment with SAIT301. Suppression of integrin β3 decreased AKT
phosphorylation in SAIT301-resistant cells and restores SAIT301 responsiveness in HCC1954
cells, which are resistant to SAIT301. Gene expression analysis using CCLE database shows
cancer cells with high levels of FGFR and integrin β3 are resistant to crizotinib treatment,

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Met, a typical receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) present on cell surfaces, is overexpressed in
various tumors and may contribute to the poor prognosis of several malignancies1,2. Met
functions to mediate a wide spectrum of signals driven by binding with its ligand hepatocyte
growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and promotes cancer progression, metastasis, cancer
cell migration and angiogenesis3. HGF/SF binding to Met induces Met dimerization
followed by the activation of intracellular signal transduction such as MAPK and AKT
phosphorylation4,5. Among signal cascades induced by Met activation, AKT
phosphorylation is related to cell survival6; treatment of cancer cells with an anti-Met
antibody results in marked antiproliferative effect and a concomitant decrease of AKT
phosphorylation and increase of apoptosis7.
Because of the relevance of Met to cancer biology, it has been a popular target for cancer
drug development8,9. Several Met-targeted drugs such as cabozantinib, onartuzumab and
tivantinib are in phase 3 registration trials. Every Met targeted drug being tested in phase 3
clinical trials targets Met and other targets simultaneously or in combination with another
drug10. Cabozantinib was approved by the United States FDA to treat medullary thyroid
cancer; this drug targets Met and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
simultaneously11. Onartuzumab, an anti-Met monoclonal human antibody, and tivantinib, a
small molecule Met inhibitor, are in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with erlotinib12–14.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Met has been validated as an oncogenic kinase in preclinical models through the use of
selective kinase inhibitors15–17. Although these inhibitors may induce early responses, the
emergence of drug resistance is common and limits their effectiveness18. The Met pathway
was associated with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors in EGFR mutant NSCLCs19. In turn, the activation of the HER family was shown
to be responsible for the resistance of PHA665752, a Met specific inhibitor, in Met-addicted
gastric cancer cells20,21. It was also reported that resistance to Met targeting inhibitors can
occur through MET point mutations, especially at Y123022, MET gene amplification
followed by KRAS over-expression in Met-addicted gastric and lung cancer cells23, and
over-expression of constitutively active SND1-BRAF fusion protein24. In NSCLC, the
mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR/Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor was attributed to
the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the Wnt signaling pathway25.
However, the underlying mechanism of acquired or inherent resistance to Met targeted
antibodies has not been fully elucidated26–28. Although the relationship between Met and

other RTKs in the survival of Met drug resistant cancer cells remains uncertain, it has been
shown that Met inhibitor-driven resistance could be rescued by inactivation of fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) by small molecules29,30. Recently, many approaches have
focused on discovering biomarkers for patient selection and exploring novel combination
therapies31. To systematically identify targets whose inhibition would increase the response
of cancer cells to Met inhibitors, we performed medium-throughput siRNA library synthetic
lethal screening targeting genes associated with systems biology-derived EGFR and Met
signaling pathways32. Here, we show that FGFR could have a role as an alternative driver
kinase for Met because dependence on either FGFR or Met can be compensated by
activation of the other kinase. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of FGFR and Met or
intervention at a common downstream effector such as AKT is required for effective Met
targeted anti-cancer therapeutics.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that integrin β1 mediates EGFR drug resistance and its
association with the Met signaling pathway in NSCLCs33. Integrin β subunits are adhesion
molecules involved in cell survival and cancer resistance to chemotherapy in breast
cancers34,35. Here, we identify significant crosstalk between integrin β3 and Met in
HCC1954 breast cancer cells and investigate the mechanism of Met drug resistance related
to integrin signaling. We also demonstrate that perturbation of integrin β3 and FGFR
signaling significantly inhibits proliferation of SAIT301-resistant MKN45 cells. These data
provide a strong rationale for the use of integrin β3 and FGFR inhibitors in Met-amplified
tumors that have become resistant to selective Met inhibition, or to combined therapy to
prevent these resistance mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate a specific crosstalk of
integrin, FGFR and Met pathways and suggest the partial overlap of downstream signaling
and common cellular effects of each pathway.

Results
Synthetic lethal screening to identify sensitizers of cellular response to a Met inhibitor

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to identify molecular determinants that modulate cellular responses to Met-targeted
therapies we developed a siRNA library and performed synthetic lethal screening using a
Met-specific monoclonal antibody, SAIT3017,36. Previously we reported that SAIT301
promotes Met degradation via a LRIG1-mediated pathway. SAIT301 treatment promoted
the binding of Met with LRIG1, bypassing the Cbl-mediated Met degradation pathway
which requires Met activation. This unique mechanism permits SAIT301 to induce Met
degradation without triggering Met signaling activation, and consequently activate cellular
apoptosis7. The siRNA library used in our studies comprised of siRNAs targeting 1310
genes. We used Met as a seed node to collect data from public archives reporting curated
pathway information, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), association in protein complexes,
and putative genes responsive to Met antibodies (Supplementary Figure S1). The data
mining provided 828 genes in the Met-centered network. As there is good evidence of
crosstalk amongst the Met and EGFR pathways, we included the 638 genes from an EGFRcentered network described by one of us (LMW)32. A total of 1310 genes comprised the
final network, which included 156 genes shared by the two networks (Supplementary Figure
S1).

The MKN45 gastric cancer cell line is dependent on Met signaling for proliferation and
survival. This cell line was screened with the siRNA library targeting 1310 genes in
combination with vehicle or SAIT301 at IC20. Primary hits were identified as genes that,
when knocked down, cause reduction of cell viability by >15% of normalized cell viability
in the presence of SAIT301 compare with vehicle control (False Discovery Rate (FDR) <
20% and Sensitization Index (SI) < 0.85) in three independent experiments.
To further validate the positive hits, MKN45 cells were screened using the deconvoluted
siRNAs that target candidate genes identified in the initial screening studies. Statistical
analysis confirmed that 69 validated genes significantly increased the sensitivity of MKN45
cells to SAIT301 treatment (Table 1). Therefore, the 69 genes were considered to be
potential mediators of resistance to SAIT301. Figure 1a demonstrates that the distribution of
viability and SI of 69 hits was independent of the viability reduction induced by siRNA
knockdown in the absence of antibody treatment. Most of the sensitizing hits were
connected in a physically interacting network (Figure 1b), and the distribution of these hits
was random in the context of the full library.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next assessed the efficacy of these 69 putative sensitizers to SAIT301 treatment in seven
other cell lines – NCI-N87 (gastric cancer), HCC827 (lung cancer), BxPC3 (pancreatic
cancer), H1993 (lung cancer), A549 (lung cancer), RKO (colon cancer) as well as HCC1954
(breast cancer). As shown in Figure 1c, 24 genes sensitized at least three of these cell lines
to the effects of a Met targeting antibody.
Pathway analysis of the targets from the screen implicates the FGFR and integrin
pathways as key regulators of the efficacy of a Met targeting antibody

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To delineate the functional associations and identify potential interacting partners of the 69
validated hits, we evaluated the hit network using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
software (http://www.ingenuity.com/). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that seven
canonical signaling pathways were utilized by the identified 69 hits (P<0.015). The genes
involved in each individual pathway are summarized in Figure 2a. As these pathways were
all statistically significantly enriched by the analysis, we examined the frequency of the
genes shared by different pathways. Genes such as RAF1, AKT2, SOS1, KRAS (shaded in
blue) are heavily shared by 6 out of 7 pathways, indicating that the RAS/RAF/MEK and
PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are common downstream pathways. ITGB3, FGFR3, SGK1
(red, orange shades) are not shared by more than two signaling pathways, therefore
representing the involvement of individual signaling pathways. Subsequent network analysis
corroborated several interacting partners of Met signaling that potentially mediate resistance
to Met inhibitors. Among them, highly ranked partners are cell surface receptors triggering
intracellular signaling system, such as FGFR3, involved in the FGFR signaling pathway,
and ITGB3, triggering the integrin signaling pathway. Depletion of these two genes
significantly reduces cancer cell viability when employed in combination with SAIT301
treatment. IPA analysis of the distribution of connections indicates potential interactions
amongst the FGFR, integrin and Met signaling pathways (Figure 2b), which may serve as
compensatory pathways for escape from Met blockade.

Based on these findings, FGFR3 and ITGB3 were selected for further studies that explore
the potential for SAIT301-based combination therapy.

FGFR3 suppression increases the anti-proliferative effects of SAIT301 by induction of
apoptosis in MKN45 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

FGFR signaling is known to be responsible for acquired resistance to RTK inhibitors, such
as crizotinib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)29 and vemurafenib in melanoma37. In the
synthetic lethal screening studies described here, the growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301
was increased with concomitant knockdown of the FGFR3 gene in MKN45 cells compare
with control siRNA transfected MKN45 cells (Figure 3a). Knockdown of FGFR3 gene also
increased the growth inhibitory effect of other Met inhibitors such as PHA665752 and
XL-184 (Figure 3b and 3c); PHA665752 is a small molecule inhibitor that specifically
targets Met17, and XL-184 is a small molecule inhibitor that targets the Met, VEGFR2, and
Ret kinases38. We then investigated the mechanisms through which FGFR3 knockdown
promotes the anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 in MKN45 cells. FGFR3 knockdown increased
the apoptosis of MKN45 cells compare with treatment with SAIT301 alone (Figure 3d).
Apoptosis induction by FGFR3 suppression was further confirmed by cleavage of PARP
and caspase-3 (Supplementary Figure S2). It is reported that FGFR3 inhibition leads to
apoptosis due to decreased expression of Bcl-239. We therefore examined the expression of
Bcl-xL, which is transcribed by BCL2L1, one of the 69 sensitizers identified by our
synthetic lethal screening. FGFR3 knockdown substantially enhanced reduction of Bcl-xL
protein and SAIT301-induced PARP cleavage (Figure 3e). To determine the underlying
signaling mechanism for the regulation of Bcl-xL expression, we tested the MAPK
inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126) and an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). Interestingly, a p38
inhibitor, SB203580, in the presence of a Met targeting antibody, suppressed Bcl-xL
expression, followed by induction of apoptosis (Figure 3f). Consistent with this finding,
BCL2L1 knockdown also increased the growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301 (Figure 3g).
Additionally, FGFR signaling activation by bFGF treatment restored the growth inhibition
induced by SAIT301 (Supplementary Figure S3), further confirming the role of FGFR
activity in cellular sensitivity to a Met-targeting antibody. These data strongly support that
FGFR signaling has an anti-apoptotic role in MKN45 cells by sustaining Bcl-xL expression,
and FGFR suppression makes these cells susceptible to apoptosis induced by Met-targeting
drugs.
Combinations of selective FGFR inhibitors and Met inhibitors synergistically inhibit cancer
cell growth accompanied by induction of apoptosis
Because genetic knockdown of FGFR3 sensitizes MKN45 cells to SAIT301 treatment, we
assessed whether pharmacological inhibitors of the FGFR family have similar effects. The
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD173074, is a specific and potent inhibitor of the
FGFR family40. PD173074 potently inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR in MKN45
cells and siRNAs directed against other FGFR family members also increased Met targeted
antibody-mediated efficacy (Supplementary Figure S4). MKN45 cell viability was reduced
by Met inhibition using SAIT301 alone, and this inhibition was significantly enhanced by
the addition of PD173074 (combination index [CI] < 1; isobologram analysis; Figure 4a).
PD173074 treatment also promoted the cell growth inhibitory effect of crizotinib, a small

molecule targeting Met as well as ALK16, PHA665752, and XL-184 (Figure 4b, 4c and 4d).
To further confirm this effect, we tested EBC1, a lung cancer cell line that is known to be
addicted to Met signaling for its survival7. Cell growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301 was
increased by the addition of PD173074 in EBC1 cells (combination index [CI] < 1;
isobologram analysis; Figure 4e). Like MKN45 cells, EBC1 cells showed marked reduction
of cell viability when treated with Met targeting inhibitors, PHA665752 and XL-184, in the
presence of PD173074 compare with the treatment with either drug alone (Supplementary
Figure S5a and S5b). We tested another selective FGFR inhibitor, NVP-BGJ398 (hereinafter
referred to as BGJ398) that is currently in phase I clinical trials41. BGJ398 combined with
SAIT301 also has a synergistic effect on growth inhibition of both EBC1 and MKN45 cells
(combination index [CI] < 1; isobologram analysis; Supplementary Figure S6). We then
determined if the effects of combining FGFR inhibitors with SAIT301 were due to induction
of apoptosis. SAIT301-mediated cell apoptosis in EBC1 cells was dramatically enhanced
with the addition of PD173074 or BGJ398 (Figure 4f). Furthermore, as measured by
immunoblot analysis, PD173074 significantly induced PARP cleavage when combined with
SAIT301 (Figure 4g). PD173074 alone had no effect on the protein levels of Bcl-xL, but
exposure to the combination of PD173074 and SAIT301 induced a nearly complete ablation
of Bcl-xL. As BCL2L1 knockdown improved SAIT301 efficacy in MKN45 cells, combined
treatment with SAIT301 and ABT-263, a potent inhibitor of Bcl-xL42, synergistically
inhibited cell growth of EBC1 cells (Figure 4h). Crizotinib also synergized with BGJ398 in
EBC1 cells (Figure 4i and 4j). BGJ398 treatment increased the apoptotic rate induced by
Met inhibitors, PHA665752 or XL-184 (Figure 4k and 4l). These data suggest that FGFR
activation maintains anti-apoptotic regulation in Met-addicted cancer cells. We further
confirmed the combination effect using a nude mouse heterotropic MKN45 xenograft
model. SAIT301 demonstrated an inhibition of tumor growth, resulting in the reduction of
tumor volume by 27.8%. Combination treatment of SAIT301 and BGJ398 resulted in the
reduction of tumor volume by 41.2% (Supplementary Figure S7). These findings further
support the concept that FGFR inhibitors and Met-targeted drugs cooperatively inhibit
cancer cell growth.
MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells display activation of FGFR3, which confers resistance to
Met inhibition through reactivation of AKT signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since acquired resistance is a general phenomenon in targeted therapy, identifying the
relevant resistance mechanisms can improve the clinical benefit of targeted cancer drugs43.
We created SAIT301-resistant clones of MKN45 cells and EBC1 cells that originally were
sensitive to this antibody7. The viability of SAIT301-resistant clones nos. 1 and 24 was not
affected by SAIT301 treatment at up to 2 µg/ml concentrations that induced ~50% growth
inhibition in parental MKN45 cells (Figure 5a). To characterize underlying molecular
mechanisms of resistance in these SAIT301-resistant clones, we investigated the activation
status of several signaling mediators. As shown in Figure 5b, the phosphorylation of FGFR3
and AKT is higher in SAIT301-resistant clones compare with the parental MKN45 cells. To
test if insensitivity of resistant cells to SAIT301 is due to the activation of AKT, we
performed cell viability assays with SAIT301 in the presence of an AKT inhibitor,
MK-220644,45. AKT inhibition using MK-2206 re-sensitized MKN45-SAIT301 resistant
cells to SAIT301 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S8a).

Because AKT is commonly involved in the signaling of several RTKs, FGFR could be an
upstream RTK of activated AKT in SAIT301 resistant clones. As shown in Figure 5d,
SAIT301-mediated inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by cotreatment with PD173074. To investigate the role of FGFR in acquired resistance for
SAIT301, MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clone #24 cells were treated with SAIT301 and
BGJ398. Concomitant inhibition of Met and FGFR signaling using SAIT301 and BGJ398
led to a dose-dependent inhibition of viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells (Figure
5e). Because parental MKN45 cells displayed decreased levels of Bcl-xL following FGFR
inhibition (Figure 3e), we tested whether Met inhibition in combination with ABT-263 could
inhibit the viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells. ABT-263 as well as BGJ398
significantly reduced the cell viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant #1 cells treated with
SAIT301 (Supplementary Figure S8b). To confirm the role of FGFR function in acquired
resistance to Met targeting therapy, we tested EBC1-SAIT301 resistant clones, and found
that AKT phosphorylation was elevated in these cells (Supplementary Figure S9a).
Combined inhibition of Met and FGFR led to a reduction of cell viability in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5f and Supplementary Figure S9b). These data further support
FGFR and its downstream pathway mediated signaling as a potentially important
mechanism of acquired resistance to Met inhibition.
ITGB3 inhibition improves the anti-tumor efficacy of SAIT301 in cancer cells with acquired
and innate resistance to Met inhibition
ITGB3 is another highly ranked hit from our synthetic lethal screening study, and ITGB3 is
known to influence the development and progression of breast cancers46,47. To investigate
the relationship of ITGB3 expression to Met resistance, knockdown assays were conducted
with MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells. As shown in Figure 6a, ITGB3 suppression by siRNA
enhanced the effects of SAIT301 on cell viability. A potent integrin β3 inhibitor,
cilengitide19,48, also enhanced the effects of SAIT301 in MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells
(Figure 6b). Combination treatment of cilengitide further enhanced SAIT301-mediated
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation compared to treatment with SAIT301 alone (Figure 6c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HCC1954 breast cancer cells have high Met protein expression, and were employed to test
the efficacy of Met targeting drugs49. HCC1954 cells did not respond to SAIT301 treatment
and were shown to have very low protein levels of FGFR3 but relatively high levels of
integrin β3 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that a FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, yields no
synergistic inhibition of proliferation with SAIT301 in these cells (data not shown). The
reason might be low levels of FGFR3 phosphorylation compared to MKN45 cells in which
FGFR inhibitors have synergistic effects with SAIT301 (Supplementary Figure S10). To
investigate the role of ITGB3 in innate resistance to SAIT301, the effect of knockdown of
ITGB3 was tested in HCC1954 cells. The combination of SAIT301 treatment and ITGB3
knockdown resulted in greater inhibition of cell growth (Figure 6d) and AKT
phosphorylation (Figure 6e) as compared to SAIT301 treatment alone.
Additionally, to elucidate the potential implication of FGFR and ITGB3 in cancer cell
responses to Met targeting therapy in general, we first analyzed IC50 values for 504 cell
lines following treatment with crizotinib (PF-2341066) from the CCLE database (http://

www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/) and categorized each cell line into three tiers (low, medium
and high) based on the expression levels of FGFR2, FGFR3, and ITGB3, with cutoffs at 33
and 67 percentile values. Cell lines that have “low” expression for all three genes were
assigned to Group A, while Group B consisted of cell lines that have “high” expression for
at least one of the three genes. The median IC50 values for Group A and B are 6.81 and 8.00,
respectively (p=0.045 by Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 6f). These data provide molecular
validation of ITGB3 or FGFR family as being synthetically lethal with a Met inhibitor under
defined conditions.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As it is well known that repeated treatment with targeted cancer drugs eventually leads to
drug resistance18, investigating the mechanism of acquired resistance is important in the
development of cancer drugs. siRNA screening has been demonstrated as an effective
method for identifying the potential mechanisms of acquired or inherent resistance to certain
drugs50,51. We developed a siRNA library centered to Met and EGFR signaling and
performed synthetic lethal screening to search for key regulators related to drug resistance
against an anti-Met therapeutic antibody. The siRNA library used in our studies was
comprised of siRNAs targeting the 1310 Met- and EGFR-centered genes. By focusing on
the statistically significant viability changes and by filtering off-target effects by requiring
two or more siRNAs to replicate the effects, we were able to identify 69 genes connected to
several signaling pathways that likely mediate SAIT301 resistance. By examining the
frequency of the genes shared by these seven putative signaling pathways, we found many
heavily shared hits (RAF1, AKT2, SOS1, KRAS) located at the mediator level of cross-talk
involved in resistance, did not represent any specific pathway. In contrast, canonical
pathway enrichment and network analysis of the 69 gene validated hit set revealed
enrichment of the integrin and FGFR signaling pathways. ITGB3 and FGFR3 regulate the
integrin and FGF signaling pathways, respectively, are well enriched surface molecules and
are easily accessible to targeted therapies. Furthermore, potential interaction indicated
compensatory pathways amongst the FGFR, integrin and Met signaling pathways.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent reports have referred to signaling crosstalk between FGFR and Met. In AML,
FGFR1 is responsible for innate resistance to crizotinib by inducing HGF transcription29. In
turn, HGF secretion compensates for cancer cell growth inhibition by BGJ398, a selective
FGFR inhibitor52. The results from the present study support previous findings, as we show
that suppression of FGFR can significantly improve the anti-proliferative effects of Met
targeting drugs in Met-addicted cell lines such as MKN45 (gastric cancer) and EBC1 (lung
cancer). In MKN45, FGFR signaling has an anti-apoptotic function by retaining Bcl-xL
expression through constitutively active p38, and suppresses the transcription of proapoptotic genes such as TRAIL and BIM (data not shown). Pharmacological inhibitors
targeting FGFR synergize with Met targeting drugs in preventing cancer cell growth in vitro
and in vivo. These data suggest that a Met targeting drug in combination with an FGFR
inhibitor warrants further interrogation in combination therapy.
In the present study, we demonstrated that SAIT301-resistant clones obtained through
prolonged treatment with SAIT301 exhibit enhanced FGFR3 activation and increased AKT

phosphorylation. AKT activation appears to be a key mechanism for resistance to the Mettargeting antibody, and MK-2206, an AKT inhibitor, restores the sensitivity of resistant cells
to SAIT301 (Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S8a). FGFR signaling compensates for
the inhibition of Met in 2 ways, by retaining anti-apoptotic molecules and by activating
PI3K/AKT signaling. These data provide the rationale for further investigation combinations
of Met and FGFR inhibitors to overcome acquired resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also examined integrin signaling, which emerged as another highly ranked resistancepromoting signaling pathway in the analysis of our screening studies. Met binds to integrin
β3 and promotes the migration and invasion of mammary epithelial cells47. Suppression of
ITGB3 improved the efficacy of SAIT301 in vitro, through anti-proliferative effects but not
by facilitating apoptosis in MKN45 cells (data not shown). Cilengitide, an integrin β3
inhibitor, also restored sensitivity to SAIT301 in SAIT301-resistant MKN45 cells. In
addition, integrin signaling may be related to innate resistance to SAIT301. SAIT301 alone
has no anti-proliferative effect on HCC1954, even though this cell line possesses a relatively
high level of Met expression compare with other breast cancer cell lines. However, ITGB3
inhibition combined with SAIT301 had significant anti-tumor effects. Interestingly,
transcript levels of ITGB3 are high in HCC1954 compare with other Met-addicted cell lines,
such as MKN45 and EBC1 (data not shown). These findings imply that ITGB3 can be used
as a putative predictive marker as well as a target for combination therapy employing
SAIT301. Although future studies will be required to confirm the hypothesis that the
expression of FGFR and ITGB3 can both predict the efficacy of SAIT301 and comprise a
new combination treatment strategy, our synthetic lethal screening approach appears to be a
useful way to identify potential candidates for combination with a tumor targeting
monoclonal antibody that perturbs cancer cell signaling.
In summary, we have identified a number of key regulators of resistance to a Met targeting
antibody by synthetic lethal screening. Among them, we have validated that FGFR and
integrin are important components for resistance mechanism toward SAIT301, and possibly
for Met inhibitors in general. Combining Met inhibitors with FGFR or integrin inhibitors
may be useful to mitigate the development of clinical resistance. In addition, both FGFR and
integrin may be useful as predictive markers for clinical response to Met inhibitors.

Materials and methods
siRNA library construction
We have previously reported on an EGFR network targeted library32 using EGFR as the
seed protein. This network was involved in this study based on the evidence of crosstalk
amongst the Met and EGFR pathways. A distinct Met-centered network containing 828
genes was developed using the open source software tool, Cytoscape with Met as the seed
protein. Bioinformatic databases were mined for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), protein
complexes, members of canonical pathways linked with Met and additional genes include

Further testing of identified sensitizing genes in responsive and non-responsive cell lines
We further tested the 69 validated hits for sensitization to SAIT301 in three SAIT301
responsive cell lines (BxPC-3, HCC827, H1993) versus four SAIT301 non-responsive cell
lines (A549, NCI-N87, RKO and HCC1954). Cells were transfected with siRNA pools
comprised of two most effective siRNAs identified during the validation. SI and statistical
significance were calculated as in Supplementary Information. All experiments were
performed at least three times independently.
Network analysis with 69 validated hits

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For canonical pathway enrichment, network analysis and gene interaction networks were
generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity systems, Redwood City, CA,
USA; www.Ingenuity.com). 69 validated hits were uploaded into the application. MiMI
plugin for Cytoscape was used to access the integrated molecular data and to retrieve
interaction map that display protein interactions. All 69 genes were hierarchically clustered
as distance measure with Cluster 3.0, and then visualized using Java TreeView
(version1.1.6r2).
Generation of SAIT301-resistant MKN45 and EBC1 cells in vitro
To generate SAIT301 resistant clones, MKN45 and EBC1 cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations (range 1–10 µg/ml) of SAIT301 over 3 months in vitro. To confirm that these
clones are durably resistant to SAIT301, cell viability tests were performed after the
resistant clones had been cultured in the presence or absence of SAIT301 for 6 weeks.
Cell viability and apoptosis assay
Cell viability test and apoptosis assay were performed as previously reported7,36. Synergism
for drug combination was quantified by the combination index (CI), where CI<1 and CI=0
indicate synergistic and additive effects, respectively. CI was calculated with CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).

inhibitor (BGJ398, 5 µM) for 72 hours. Cell numbers were normalized in parallel wells
using CTG assay. The relative caspase-3/7 activity (%) is represented as a percentage
comparison to the control group (no antibody treatment). (k) The apoptotic rate of EBC1
cells was determined by caspase activation using Caspase 3/7 Glo assay after treating with
20 nM of PHA665752 alone or in combination with the FGFR inhibitor (BGJ398, 5 µM) for
72 hours. Cell numbers were normalized in parallel wells using CTG assay. The relative
caspase-3/7 activity (%) is represented as a percentage comparison to the control group (no
antibody treatment). (l) The apoptotic rate of EBC1 cells was determined by caspase
activation using Caspase 3/7 Glo assay after treating with 1 µM of XL-184 alone or in
combination with the FGFR inhibitor (BGJ398, 5 µM) for 72 hours. Cell numbers were
normalized in parallel wells using CTG assay. The relative caspase-3/7 activity (%) is
represented as a percentage comparison to the control group (no antibody treatment).

(a) The viability of MKN45, MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clones #1 and #24 was measured
by CTG assay after treating with various concentrations (0.016, 0.08, 0.4, and 2 µg/ml) of
SAIT301 for 72 hours. The relative cell viability (%) represents the percent growth as
compared to the control group (no antibody treatment). (b) Phosphorylation of FGFR3 and
AKT was detected by immunoblot assay in MKN45, MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clones #1
and #24. GAPDH was a loading control. (c) The viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant
clone #1 cells was measured by CTG assay after treating with various concentrations (0.016,
0.008, 0.4 and 2 µg/ml) of SAIT301 alone or in combination with the AKT inhibitor
(MK-2206, 5 µM) for 72 hours. The relative cell viability (%) represents percent growth
compared to the control group (no antibody and inhibitor treatment). (d) AKT
phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot assay in MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clone #24
cells. Twenty-four hours after pre-treatment of FGFR inhibitor (PD173074, 10 µM),
MKN45-resistant clone #24 cells were treated with medium or 2 µg/ml of SAIT301 for 1
hour. (e) The viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clone #24 cells was measured by CTG
