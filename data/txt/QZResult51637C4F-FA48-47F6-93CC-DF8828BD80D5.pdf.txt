Navitoclax (ABT-263) Accelerates Apoptosis during DrugInduced Mitotic Arrest by Antagonizing Bcl-xL
Jue Shi1,2, Yuan Zhou1, Hsiao-Chun Huang2, and Timothy J. Mitchison2

Abstract
Combining microtubule-targeting antimitotic drugs with targeted apoptosis potentiators is a promising new
chemotherapeutic strategy to treat cancer. In this study, we investigate the cellular mechanism by which
navitoclax (previously called ABT-263), a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, potentiates apoptosis triggered by paclitaxel and
an inhibitor of kinesin-5 (K5I, also called a KSP inhibitor), across a panel of epithelial cancer lines. By using timelapse microscopy, we showed that navitoclax has little effect on cell death during interphase, but strongly
accelerates apoptosis during mitotic arrest, and greatly increases the fraction of apoptosis-resistant cells that
die. By systematically knocking down individual Bcl-2 proteins, we determined that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are the
primary negative regulators of apoptosis during prolonged mitotic arrest. Mcl-1 levels decrease during mitotic
arrest because of an imbalance between synthesis and turnover, and turnover depends in part on the MULE/
HUWE1 E3 ligase. The combination of Mcl-1 loss with inhibition of Bcl-xL by navitoclax causes rapid apoptosis
in all lines tested. Variation in expression levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL largely determines variation in response to
antimitotics alone, and antimitotics combined with navitoclax, across our panel. We concluded that Bcl-xL is a
critical target of Bcl-2 family inhibitors for enhancing the lethality of antimitotic drugs in epithelial cancers, and
combination treatment with navitoclax and a spindle specific antimitotic, such as a K5I, might be more effective
than paclitaxel alone. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4518–26. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Antimitotic drugs, such as paclitaxel, are important for
treatment of a variety of solid tumors. They induce prolonged
mitotic arrest through activation of the spindle assembly
checkpoint (1). Drug treated cells then either die in mitotic
arrest, or slip out of mitotic arrest into an abnormal G1 state in
which they may die, arrest in a tetraploid G1 state, or continue
to proliferate (2–6). Although antimitotics at sufficiently high
concentration can cause mitotic arrest in all proliferating
cells, sensitivity to induction of cell death during or after this
arrest is highly variable across different cancer cell lines in
syngeneic mouse tumors (7) and cultured human cell lines (8).
This poorly understood variation in cell death sensitivity may
contribute to large variation in patient responses.

Although nonapoptotic death has been reported (9, 10),
most of the available data, including our own, show that
antimitotics induce cell death during mitotic arrest, or after
mitotic slippage, by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, in which
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is
the defining event (11–13). Thus, one way to potentially
enhance antimitotics-induced cell death, and reduce variation
in death sensitivity across cancers, is to combine antimitotics
with drugs that directly stimulate MOMP. ABT-737 and its
orally active analog, navitoclax (formerly ABT-263), are among
the most promising candidates for such drug combinations
(14–16). ABT-737 is a potent inhibitor (Ki <10 nmol/L) of
several Bcl-2 homologs that inhibit MOMP, including Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w (14). These drugs have already been shown
to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel in cell culture,
animal models, and early-stage clinical trials (17, 18). However,
the cellular mechanism by which ABT-737 and navitoclax
enhance paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis, and how this mechanism varies across different cell types, are still poorly understood. For example, it is unclear whether the taxane þ
navitoclax combination kills cells in interphase, during mitotic
arrest, or after slippage from arrest. It is also unclear which of
the various targets of navitoclax are relevant for promoting
cancer cell killing by taxanes, which precludes development of
more selective drugs. Answering these questions might also
provide clues to the still unsolved problem of how antimitotics
trigger MOMP at the molecular level.
Here, we investigate the cellular mechanism by which
navitoclax enhances cancer cell killing by 2 antimitotic drugs,

Navitoclax Antagonizes Bcl-xL in Mitotic Arrest

the microtubule-stabilizing drug, paclitaxel, and an allosteric
inhibitor of motor protein, kinesin-5 (K5I, also called a KSP
inhibitor), both of which promote prolonged mitotic arrest,
but by different mechanisms. We test which Bcl-2 family
members are important for inhibiting and enhancing cell
death during mitotic arrest caused by these drugs in epithelial
cancer cells and thus identify relevant targets of navitoclax
when it is combined with an antimitotic. Our primary technique for measuring apoptosis was time-lapse microscopy,
which allows conceptual synchronization of cell cycle without
the need for additional drugs, and, naturally, accounts for the
very large variation between individual cells in death sensitivity and kinetics (4, 6). Our findings have important implications for how the navitoclax þ taxane combination may work
or fail in the clinic. Moreover, as neither K5Is nor navitoclax
are neurotoxic, our results also suggest that navitoclax, or a
comparable Bcl-xL inhibitor, would strongly potentiate the
clinical response to K5Is, without causing neurotoxicity that is
characteristic of microtubule-targeting antimitotics.

30 ) was synthesized by Dharmacon and used at final concentration of 50 nmol/L. Dharmacon On-Target plus siControl (D001810-01) was used as nontargeting siRNA control. All siRNA
transfections were done by using either DharmaFect 1 (Dharmacon) or HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to manufacturers’
instructions. Experiments were conducted after 48 hours of
gene silencing.

Materials and Methods

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were obtained by using LDS sample buffer
(NuPAGE; Invitrogen). Proteins were resolved on 10% or
12% Tris-glycine gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with commercial
primary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection by using
ECL-plus (Amersham). Antibodies: PARP1 (#9542), Bcl-w
(#2724), Bcl-xL (#2762), Bim (#2933), Bak (#3814), and
Cdc20 (#4823) were purchased from Cell Signaling; Bax
(#sc-493) and Mcl-1 (#sc-819) from Santa Cruz; Bcl-2
(#M088901) from Dako. Anti-actin (#A5316) from Sigma
was used as a loading control.
For Western blot analysis of synchronized mitotic cells, we
grew large volume of cells in 25-cm dishes to 90% confluency,
then treated the cells with 150 nmol/L paclitaxel or 1 mmol/L
K5I to induce mitotic arrest. After 3 hours of drug treatment,
the mitotic fraction of cells was collected by gently shaking
and washing the dish to detach the mitotic cells from the
bottom.

Cell culture
All cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and cultured under 37 C and 5% CO2 in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS),
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. HeLa was
maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium, U2OS was
maintained in McCoy’s, OVCAR-5 was maintained in RPMI,
and A549 was maintained in F-12K.
Chemicals
Paclitaxel was purchased from Sigma. The potent K5I
(EMD534085) was provided by Merck-Serono. Responses to
EMD534085 have been shown to be similar to s-trityl-cysteine,
a commercially available K5I (4). Navitoclax (ABT-263) was
purchased from Selleck.
Time-lapse microscopy
Cells were plated in 35-mm imaging dish (m-dish, ibidi,
Germany) and cultured in phenol red-free CO2-independent
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mL streptomycin. Cell images were acquired
with the Nikon TE2000-PFS inverted microscope enclosed in a
humidified chamber maintained at 37 C. Cells were imaged
every 10 minutes by using a motorized stage and a 20
objective (NA ¼ 0.95). Images were viewed and analyzed by
using the MetaMorph software (Molecular Dynamics).
Gene knockdown by RNA interference
siRNAs for knocking down individual Bcl-2 family proteins
were obtained from the following sources: Bcl-2 (J-003307-16),
Bcl-w (J-004384-07), Bcl-xL (J-003458-11), Bak (J-003305-07),
and Bax (J-003308-12) from Dharmacon; Mcl-1 (s120644) and
Cdc20 (4392420) from Ambion; Bim (#6461) from Cell Signaling. The above siRNAs were used at final concentration of 20
nmol/L for RNA interference (RNAi) in all 4 cell lines. siRNA

Gene expression by transient transfection
To express Mcl-1-GFP or Bak-EGFP, U2OS cells were seeded
in 6-well plate and transiently transfected with the desired
plasmids by using Fugene6 (Roche) according to manufacturer's instruction. Drug treatment experiments of
U2OS cells with Mcl-GFP overexpression as well as time-lapse
imaging experiment of U2OS cells expressing Bak-EGFP were
conducted 48 hours after transient transfection. Both the Mcl1-GFP and Bak-EGFP constructs were generous gift from Dr.
Peter Sorger's lab at the Department of Systems Biology,

Results
Bcl-2 family expression does not obviously predict
apoptosis sensitivity
We previously profiled the sensitivity of a panel of cancerderived, and one noncancer telomerase-immortalized (RPE),
cell lines for sensitivity to apoptosis in response to antimitotic
drugs (8). At drug concentrations that were saturating for
mitotic arrest, the extent and speed of apoptosis varied greatly
across the cell line panel, but correlated strongly for 3 different
antimitotic drugs, suggesting they trigger apoptosis by similar
mechanisms. In every case subsequently studied, cell death
occurred during or after slippage from mitotic arrest, by
MOMP followed by caspase activation (ref. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To probe the mechanistic basis of differential
MOMP sensitivity across the panel, we measured levels of
known MOMP regulators by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Basal
expression of Bax, Bak, Mcl-1, and Bcl-w were relatively similar

Navitoclax accelerates apoptosis during mitotic arrest
All the cell lines expressed antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members. As a first test of their roles in cell death during
or after mitotic arrest, we measured the effect of navitoclax, a
potent small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bcl-xL, but
not Mcl-1, using time-lapse microscopy. We chose HeLa,
U2OS, OVCAR-5, and A549 to cover the spectrum from most
to least death sensitive, and also variation in expression levels
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Navitoclax was used at 1 mmol/L, a
clinically relevant concentration that is probably saturating
for Bcl-2 family binding (14). In navitoclax alone proliferation
continued normally in HeLa, OVCAR-5, and A549 cells, and we
observed less than 5% cell death in these 3 cell lines after 60
hours of drug treatment (gray lines in the top panel of Fig. 2).
In U2OS cells, navitoclax alone was cytotoxic, leading to
approximately 35% cell death after 60 hours of drug treatment.
When navitoclax was combined with an antimitotic drug
(paclitaxel or K5I, used at concentrations that are saturating
for mitotic arrest in all lines), we observed strong enhancement of cell death for all 4 cell lines. MOMP was observed to
precede death in more than 95% of single cell death events,
confirming that antimitotics þ navitoclax trigger cell death
mainly through the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Moreover, in antimitotic alone, or antimitotic þ navitoclax, no apoptosis occurred before cells entered mitotic arrest.

Navitoclax Antagonizes Bcl-xL in Mitotic Arrest

general difficult to interpret, as they require consideration
of drug efflux pump activity, and single cell behaviors at
subsaturating concentrations become very complex. Therefore, we chose to use only one dose and investigate the cellular
kinetics in detail so as to seek mechanistic understanding at
the level of pathways that mediate mitotic arrest and apoptosis. We picked a saturating concentration to maximize the
mechanistic strength of our results and conclusions.

Evidently, navitoclax enhances the proapoptotic signaling that
initiates when cells enter mitotic arrest instead of at time of
drug addition (6, 8). We therefore scored death kinetics by
measuring the time elapsed from the time of entry into mitotic
arrest to the time of morphologic death, that is, cell blebbing
and lysing, and plotted cumulative survival curves that provide a metric for the rate of apoptosis induction during and
after mitotic arrest (Fig. 2).
The top panel of Figure 2 shows kinetics of all cell death,
pooling death during mitotic arrest with death after mitotic
slippage. The bottom panel shows only death during mitotic
arrest. The black and red lines show death in antimitotic
alone. HeLa is the most sensitive, with most cells dying during
mitotic arrest, and A549 the least, with few cells dying. As
reported previously (8), paclitaxel (red lines) is significantly
more cytotoxic than K5I (black lines) in less death-sensitive
lines, even though both drugs cause the same kinetics of
mitotic arrest. Addition of navitoclax strongly accelerated
death during mitotic arrest in U2OS, OVCAR-5, and A549,
and moderately accelerated it in HeLa. This effect was particularly strong for cell line/drug combinations in which relatively little death occurred during mitosis for antimitotic alone
and, in some cases, caused more than 5-fold enhancement of
death (e.g., U2OS/K5I). Even in the most apoptosis-resistant
A549 cells, navitoclax strongly enhanced death during mitotic
arrest for both antimitotics.
Note that we chose to investigate the kinetics of cell
response at saturating drug concentrations of navitoclax
and antimitotics, instead of a dose titration study at fixed
time point. Dose-dependent effects of antimitotics are in

Navitoclax accelerates apoptosis mainly
by inhibiting Bcl-xL
To pinpoint the specific Bcl-2 family target(s) of navitoclax
during mitotic arrest, we used RNAi to knock down individual
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL, and
Mcl-1, and compared death kinetics to drug treatment. The top
panel of Figure 3 and Table 1 compare kinetics of overall cell
death following entry into K5I-induced mitotic arrest, pooling
both death in mitosis and death after slippage, under 7 conditions: control (no siRNA), control siRNA (control for the
proapoptotic effect of transfection), Bcl-2 siRNA, Bcl-w siRNA,
Bcl-xL siRNA, Mcl-1 siRNA, and navitoclax. The bottom panel
of Figure 3 and Table 2 compare kinetics of cell death during
mitotic arrest only. Knockdown efficiencies were generally
more than 80% and are documented in Supplementary Figure
S2. Control siRNA transfection (red lines) slightly sensitized
cells to K5I-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2 knockdown (blue lines)
was similar to control siRNA for all 4 cell lines. Bcl-w knockdown (green lines) also had little effect, except in OVCAR-5
cells, in which it increased the percentage of cell death by
approximately 2-fold, but the median time to death, Td, did not

change substantially (Table 1). Mcl-1 knockdown (magenta
lines) sensitized all lines to apoptosis, especially HeLa, in which
it had the strongest effect. This line has high expression of Mcl1 but little Bcl-xL (Fig. 1). Bcl-xL knockdown (yellow lines) had
overall the strongest effect, dramatically accelerating apoptosis
in the 3 less apoptosis-sensitive lines. In U2OS and OVCAR-5,
the effect of Bcl-xL knockdown was comparable with navitoclax treatment. In A549 it was less effective, but knockdown
was noticeably incomplete in this line (Supplementary Fig. S2).
As we saw previously with navitoclax treatment, Bcl-xL knockdown and, to a lesser extent, Mcl-1 knockdown had the effect of
increasing the fraction of cells that died in the 3 less apoptosissensitive lines, as well as shifting death from postslippage to
inside mitotic arrest. These data suggested that Bcl-xL is the
major target of navitoclax for accelerating MOMP during
mitotic arrest, and thus for potentiating cell death caused
by antimitotic drugs.
Mcl-1 is lost by turnover during mitotic arrest
Mcl-1 expression has been shown to negatively correlate
with ABT-737 sensitivity in some studies (15). All our cell lines

expressed Mcl-1 at significant levels (Fig. 1), so we next asked
why this important antiapoptotitc Bcl-2 family member did
not protect against MOMP during mitotic arrest when Bcl-xL
was inhibited with navitoclax or knockdown by RNAi.
Uniquely among characterized Bcl-2 family proteins, Mcl-1
turns over rapidly in interphase cells, with a typical half-life of
less than 1 hour (19, 20). It is constitutively ubiquitinated by E3
ligases and then degraded by proteasomes (21). Transcription
is silenced during mitotic arrest and translation is inhibited
(22–24), so we suspected Mcl-1 levels might decay during
arrest by a continuation of the interphase turnover mechanism. We first measured time courses of Mcl-1 levels in cells
treated with antimitotic drugs and found that its levels
decrease at the time point where mitotic arrest peaks
(15–30 hours; Fig. 4A). In HeLa, the level subsequently
decreases to zero as all cells die but in the more resistant
line, it recovers as cells slip out of mitotic arrest. To more
accurately measure Mcl-1 levels during mitotic arrest, we
synchronized cells by mitotic shake-off in drug and measured
Mcl-1 levels by immunoblotting. Mcl-1 levels were found to

derive the half-life t. Values of Mcl-1 level were averaged from 3 separate experiments. C, attenuation of Mcl-1 depletion by RNAi of MULE/HUWE1 (50 nmol/L)

approximately 1.6 hours in A549 during mitotic arrest
(Fig. 4B). In A549, Mcl-1 plateaus at approximately 20% of
the initial level. In HeLa, it may continue to drop, and we
suspect complete loss of Mcl-1 may trigger MOMP.
To test whether loss of Mcl-1 during mitotic arrest
contributes to apoptosis induction, we attenuated Mcl-1
depletion by RNAi knockdown of MULE/HUWE1. This is the
first E3 ligase that was shown to play a role in Mcl-1
turnover (21), subsequently others have been implicated
(see below). We used a custom synthesized siRNA used in
previous study (25) and measured the resulting apoptosis
response to antimitotics in HeLa cells by PARP1 cleavage
(Fig. 4C). MULE/HUWE1 knockdown decreased the extent
of Mcl-1 loss and also decreased PARP1 cleavage. These
data confirmed that depletion of Mcl-1 is a proapoptotic
signal that contributes to apoptosis during mitotic arrest.
Because Mcl-1 levels were only partially protected by RNAi
of MULE/HUWE1, we suspected that other turnover
mechanisms were important; anaphase promoting complex
(APC/C; ref. 26), NOXA (27), and another E3 ligase, FBW7
(28, 29) have all been implicated in recent studies. In
Supplementary Figure S3, we compared kinetics of Mcl-1
depletion in mitotic shake-off HeLa cells under 3 conditions:
control, MULE/HUWE1 siRNA, and Cdc20 siRNA (Cdc20
RNAi was used to inhibit APC/C activity). It is evident that
RNAi of both MULE/HUWE1 and Cdc20 delayed and
reduced Mcl-1 depletion during mitotic arrest. However,
neither completely rescued Mcl-1 depletion, pointing to the
existence of multiple degradation factors for Mcl-1 during
mitotic arrest.

Bim does not trigger MOMP during mitotic arrest
The activator BH-3 protein Bim was previously implicated
as the major trigger of cell death in BMK cells treated with
paclitaxel, but where in the cell cycle Bim-dependent apoptosis occurred was not determined (30). To determine
whether Bim is required to activate apoptosis during mitotic
arrest, we knocked it down by using siRNA, and measured
kinetics of cell death in HeLa, which die mainly during
mitotic arrest (Fig. 5). Knockdown was largely complete
by immunoblotting analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). Both
the extent and kinetics of death in mitosis were very similar
under treatments of K5I alone (black line in Fig. 5), K5I plus
control siRNA (red line), and K5I plus Bim siRNA (blue line),
with 80% to 90% cell death occurring during mitotic arrest
and a median time to death of 19 hours. Together with
Western blot analysis that showed no attenuation in PARP1
cleavage under Bim knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S4), we
concluded that Bim is not required to activate cell death
during mitotic arrest in HeLa. Note that Bim is a fast
turnover protein with a half-life of approximately 3 hours
(31). Therefore, on the Western blot levels of Bim exhibited
significant reduction during mitotic arrest because of transcriptional silence (24-hour time point in Supplementary
Fig. S4). In contrast, knockdown of Bax (green line) and Bak
(yellow line) caused substantial protection as expected for a
MOMP-dependent death pathway. Immunoblotting analysis
showed no upregulation of any known sensitizer BH-3 only
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S5), and we previously found
no cleavage of Bid in antimitotic treated cells (8). These data
suggested that activator BH3 proteins or upregulation of

Discussion
We observed strong acceleration of apoptosis during mitotic arrest when navitoclax was combined with antimitotic
drugs, as well as recent data from xenograft cancer models
(32), pointing to exciting potential of this combination for
treatment of common epithelial cancers. Navitoclax has been
known to potentiate paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity since
the first description of ABT-737 (17), but ours is the first study
to pinpoint where in the cell cycle this potentiation occurs,
and to document its kinetics at the single cell level. The major
target of navitoclax in the cells we tested was Bcl-xL, not Bcl-2
or Bcl-w, as evidenced by similar acceleration of apoptosis
during mitotic arrest with drug treatment and RNAi knockdown of Bcl-xL alone. The potent lethality of inhibiting Bcl-xL
during mitotic arrest is because of the fact that another
important and widely expressed antiapoptotic protein, Mcl1, is naturally depleted during mitotic arrest as a result of
imbalance between synthesis and degradation. The pathway
by which Mcl-1 is proteolyzed has been the subject of several
recent studies. MULE/HUWE1 was implicated early as an E3
ligase (21). Our data (Fig. 4C) suggest it indeed plays a role
during mitosis, though it seems not to act alone. APC/C was
recently implicated as an alternative E3 ligase (26). Our data
are consistent for a role of this factor (Supplementary Fig. S3),
though caution is required in interpreting this observation,
because APC/C plays a central role in mitotic regulation, and
its effects on Mcl-1 might be indirect. We have not yet tested
the role of other candidates, including NOXA (27) and FBW7
(28, 29). Whatever the precise mechanism of Mcl-1 proteolysis
during mitosis, the important conclusion from our perspective
is that its loss is strongly synergistic with inhibition of Bcl-xL
by navitoclax, leading to rapid apoptosis during mitotic arrest,

4524

even in lines in which little apoptosis is seen in antimitotic
alone.
The mechanism by which mitotic arrest promotes apoptosis is clarified, but not completely solved, by the finding of ours
and others (25–29) that Mcl-1 is lost during mitotic arrest
because of an imbalance between synthesis and proteolysis.
Conceptually, this finding supports a kinetic model in which
cells that enter mitotic arrest activate 2 independent and
competing pathways, one that leads to MOMP, and the other
to slippage by slow proteolysis of cyclin-B (33, 34). Combination of Mcl-1 loss with inhibition of Bcl-xL by navitoclax or
siRNA knockdown greatly accelerates the death pathway, so it
wins over the slippage pathway in a much larger fraction of
cells. Loss of Mcl-1 is clearly an important component of the
MOMP activation pathway, less clear is whether this is the
only MOMP-activating process during mitotic arrest. It is also
not clear to what extent acceleration of apoptosis activation
matters clinically, that is, if a cell is going to die eventually,
does it matter if it dies within hours following drug addition,
as opposed to days or weeks? We suspect it might, that a rapid
bolus of apoptosis might alter the tumor environment in ways
that a more delayed response does not. The issue of whether
apoptosis kinetics really matters for clinical responses will
have to be addressed in the tumor context.
Our data have shed new light on cell line variation in
antimitotic drug responses. In cells with low levels of BclxL, such as HeLa, loss of Mcl-1 alone is sufficient to release
Bax/Bak from sequestration, which allows their spontaneous
oligomerization, and triggers MOMP. In cells with substantial
levels of Bcl-xL, such as U2OS, OVCAR-5, and A549, loss of Mcl1 alone is insufficient, but combining it with Bcl-xL inhibition
or knockdown is sufficient to trigger Bax/Bak oligomerization.
It is known that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-w, can
directly sequester Bax/Bak, in particular Bak on the mitochondria (35). This might explain why Bcl-2 levels seem less
important than Bcl-xL in determining the response to antimitoics, despite wide variation in Bcl-2 expression between
cells in our panel. Consistent with a role for Bak, we observed
oligomerization of Bak-GFP preceding cell death in response
to antimitotics þ navitoclax by fluorescence microscopy
(Supplementary Fig. S6). We also found that navitoclax
remains highly effective in enhancing and accelerating mitotic
death in cells overexpressing Mcl-1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). Is
loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL activity sufficient to trigger MOMP, or
is another signal required? Depletion of Mcl-1 does not greatly
accelerate apoptosis in response to antimitotics in any line
(Fig. 2), which may indicate the need for an additional signal.
Although our data on Bim (Fig. 5) and tBid (8) suggest that
neither of the known activator BH3 proteins is required for
initiation of apoptosis during mitotic arrest, we cannot rule
out that some other, yet to be identified, Bcl-2 family member
acts as activator. Further study to determine the molecular
model for mitotic death is important for progress on understanding the action of current antimitotics and finding better
targets for future drugs.
Antimitotic drugs that are specific to the mitotic spindle-–
inhibitors of kinesin-5 (KSP), polo kinase-1, and aurora
kinases-–have so far shown somewhat disappointing clinical

results (36). K5Is are less proapoptotic than paclitaxel in cell
culture (e.g., Fig. 2 and ref. 8), which may contribute to this
clinical difference. The reasons are unclear, though the extra
death seen with paclitaxel mostly occurs after slippage. One
possible cause is greater micronucleation; cells that slip out of
paclitaxel-induced arrest always have multiple micronuclei,
whereas cells that slip out of K5I-induced arrest typically have
one large nucleus. Combination with navitoclax changes this
equation, by shifting most death into mitosis, in which the 2
drugs are almost equally proapoptotic. The combination of a
K5I and navitoclax is much more proapoptotic than K5I alone
or paclitaxel alone, and essentially equal to paclitaxel þ
navitoclax (Fig. 2). Thus the K5I þ navitoclax combination
has the promise of efficacy greater than paclitaxel alone,
comparable to paclitaxel þ navitoclax. Neither K5Is nor
navitoclax are neurotoxic, so this combination might realize
the promise of an antimitotic treatment that is efficacious but
lacks neurotoxicity.
