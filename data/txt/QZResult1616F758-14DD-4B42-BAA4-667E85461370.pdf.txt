Abstract
The majority of BRCA1-associated breast cancers are basal
cell–like, which is associated with a poor outcome. Using a
spontaneous mouse mammary tumor model, we show that
platinum compounds, which generate DNA breaks during the
repair process, are more effective than doxorubicin in
Brca1/p53–mutated tumors. At 0.5 mg/kg of daily cisplatin
treatment, 80% primary tumors (n = 8) show complete
pathologic response. At greater dosages, 100% show complete
response (n = 19). However, after 2 to 3 months of complete remission following platinum treatment, tumors relapse
and become refractory to successive rounds of treatment.
Approximately 3.8% to 8.0% (mean, 5.9%) of tumor cells
express the normal mammary stem cell markers, CD29hi24med,
and these cells are tumorigenic, whereas CD29med24 /lo and
CD29med24hi cells have diminished tumorigenicity or are
nontumorigenic, respectively. In partially platinum-responsive
primary transplants, 6.6% to 11.0% (mean, 8.8%) tumor cells
are CD29hi24med; these populations significantly increase to
16.5% to 29.2% (mean, 22.8%; P < 0.05) in platinum-refractory
secondary tumor transplants. Further, refractory tumor cells
have greater colony-forming ability than the primary transplant–derived cells in the presence of cisplatin. Expression
of a normal stem cell marker, Nanog, is decreased in the
CD29hi24med populations in the secondary transplants. Top2A
expression is also down-regulated in secondary drug-resistant
tumor populations and, in one case, was accompanied
by genomic deletion of Top2A . These studies identify
distinct cancer cell populations for therapeutic targeting in
breast cancer and implicate clonal evolution and expansion of
cancer stem-like cells as a potential cause of chemoresistance.

Introduction
Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and
BRCA2 and several other genes encoding BRCA1/2-interacting
proteins are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
syndrome (reviewed in refs. 1, 2). Hereditary breast cancer accounts
for 5% to 10% of all breast cancers, and of these, BRCA1 mutations

account for approximately half of the cases. In sporadic breast
cancer, BRCA1 mutations are rare; however, significant percentages
of sporadic cancers show reduced or absent expression of BRCA1
due to promoter hypermethylation (3). BRCA1 encodes a 220-kDa
nuclear phosphoprotein that contains multiple functional domains
that interact with proteins involved in different cellular processes,
including ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressors, oncoproteins,
DNA damage repair proteins, cell cycle regulators, and transcriptional activators and repressors (reviewed in refs. 4, 5).
In addition to interacting with ubiquitously expressed proteins,
BRCA1 associates and regulates ubiquitination of steroid hormone
receptors, estrogen receptor a and progesterone receptor (reviewed
in ref. 6). Paradoxically, BRCA1-associated breast cancers are
frequently high-grade, estrogen receptor a/progesterone receptor/
Her2 (triple)–negative basal cell–like tumors (7), with frequent
mutations of TP53 and PTEN (8). The triple-negative tumors are
initially responsive to chemotherapy with a high percentage
entering pathologic complete response; however, tumors that recur
or do not enter complete remission progress rapidly, resulting in a
poor outcome.
Roles of BRCA1 in both homologous recombination and
nonhomologous end joining DNA repair have been shown.
Therapeutic strategies that explore the DNA repair defect in BRCA
mutants have been proposed and are showing promise, in
particular with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 inhibitors (9).
BRCA1-mutated cell lines are more sensitive to cisplatin and less
responsive to doxorubicin (10, 11). However, the in vivo response
and long-term effects of platinum-based therapy in BRCA1associated tumors have yet to be established.
Mice carrying somatic mutations of Brca1 and/or p53 alleles in
mammary epithelial cells using the Cre/loxP system develop
mammary tumors with high penetrance (12–15). Tumor latency
in Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpWAPCrec mice, which express exon 11–deleted
Brca1 and exon 5– and exon 6–deleted p53, is slightly shorter than
that of Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpCK14Crec mice, which carry null alleles of
Brca1 and p53 (13, 14). On the other hand, MMTVCrea target a
small number of cells in the mammary gland and has much longer
tumor latency (12). High tumor penetrance and consistent tumor
latency of Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpWAPCrec and p53 fp/fpWAPCrec mice
allow studies of therapeutic response to single chemotherapeutic
agents such as cisplatin [cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum (CDDP)],
carboplatin, and doxorubicin, in vivo. CDDP is a member of
platinum-based compounds that form various intrastrand and
interstrand adducts with DNA (reviewed in ref. 16). Repair of the
platinum adduct is mediated by nucleotide excision repair and
single-strand and double-strand DNA break repair pathways. The
clinical use of this drug is limited due to the emergence of intrinsic
and acquired resistance and severe peripheral neurotoxicity. Other
platinum derivatives, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin, have

different toxicities and are more commonly used in the clinical
setting. Doxorubicin, also known as Adriamycin, is the most widely
used anthracycline antibiotic in the treatment of breast cancer.
It forms a complex with DNA by intercalation between base pairs,
leading to the formation of free radicals and subsequent inhibition
of DNA topoisomerase II catalytic activity (17). In clinically
aggressive breast cancer, doxorubicin is most lethal to cells that
contain high levels of topoisomerase II and are undergoing high
rates of DNA replication. Chemotherapy has improved survival
rates among cancer patients, but chemoresistance, which results in
failure in cancer treatment, remains a major challenge.
There is now much evidence that cancer stem cells, a minority
tumor cell population with stem cell properties, are capable of
maintaining continuous tumor growth (reviewed in ref. 18).
Cancer stem cells were first identified in acute myelogenous
leukemia and have recently been shown to be present in many
solid tumors, including tumors of the breast, central nervous
system, and lung adenocarcinoma (reviewed in ref. 19). In breast
cancers, CD44+CD24 /low putative cancer stem cells were
identified (20). In glioblastoma, a population of CD133+ cancer
stem cells showed significant resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents including temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide (21). In small-cell lung carcinoma, a small population of stemlike cells showing high clonogenic activity and coexpression of
CD44 and multidrug resistance gene, MDR1, showed multidrug
resistance (22).
Despite the clinical importance of chemoresistance, to date there
have been no reports of chemoresistant stem cell populations in
breast cancer. Identification and characterization of such a
subpopulation of cells will help develop strategies to target these
cells. We show here that spontaneous tumors that developed in the
conditional Brca1/p53 knockout mice respond favorably to
platinum treatment, but chemoresistance does occur and often
emerges over time. Expansion of a subpopulation of cancer stem
cells correlates with drug resistance.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpCre mutant mice and spontaneous
mammary tumor formation. Generation of Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpCre and
p53 fp/fpCre mice has previously been described (12, 13). Briefly, Brca1 exon
11–floxed (Brca1 fp/fp ) mice were obtained from Dr. Chu-Xia Deng
(NIH, Bethesda, MD; ref. 15). Brca1 fp/fp mice were bred to p53 exon
5– and exon 6–floxed (p53 fp/fp ) mice to obtain Brca1 fp/+p53 fp/+ mice.
Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpMMTVCrea and Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpWAPCrec mice were generated by crossing the heterozygous floxed mice with MMTVCrea or
WAPrtTACrec transgenic mice followed by crosses of heterozygous mice.
The WAPrtTACrec transgene expression was detected either before puberty
as reported by Lin and colleagues (12) or in doxycycline-treated pregnant
mice. Only the former group of mice were analyzed in the current study.
PCR reaction was done to confirm exon 11 deletion of Brca1 gene and exon
5 and 6 deletions of p53 gene as previously reported (12, 13). The mice were
in a C57BL/6 and 129/Sv mixed background. Mice were monitored for
palpable tumors weekly. All animal experiments were in accordance with
the guidelines of federal law and Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of California, Irvine.
Doxorubicin, cisplatin, and carboplatin treatment. Animals were
treated with doxorubicin, cisplatin, or carboplatin when tumor diameter
reached f0.5 cm. Doxorubicin (Fluka) was prepared at a stock
concentration of 58 mg/mL in DMSO and stored at 4jC. Doxorubicin was
diluted in 40% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400; Sigma) in saline at the time
of treatment. Cisplatin (CDDP; Sigma) was prepared fresh daily in 40%
PEG-400 and saline. Stock solution of carboplatin (Sigma) at 10 mg/mL in
water was stored at 4jC; dilution in 40% PEG-400 and saline was made at

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

the time of treatment. CDDP was administered i.p. every other day at 0.5,
1.5, 3, or 6 mg/kg daily for 7 d. Carboplatin was administered i.p. once every
3 d for 15 d at 32.5 or 60 mg/kg; doxorubicin was administered i.p. weekly at
1.25 or 5 mg/kg for 21 d. Tumor growth was monitored by daily caliper
measurements in two perpendicular dimensions. Tumor volume (mm3) was
calculated according to the formula (d 2  D) / 2, where d and D represent
the shortest and longest diameters, respectively.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice were sacrificed and
tissues collected when tumors reached 0.75 to 1 cm3. The tissue was fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4jC overnight followed by
paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections were stained with H&E and examined
by light microscopy. Immunostaining was done following the protocol
described in the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). To retrieve
the antigen, slides were heated for 20 min in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) in a microwave oven. Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology),
phospho-H3 (Upstate), and Rad51 antibodies were used at 1:200, 1:2,000,
and 1:50 dilutions, respectively.
Tissue disaggregation and cell preparation. Tumor tissues were
processed according to Stingl and colleagues (23) with modifications.
Briefly, tumors were minced into f2-mm3 fragments with sterile scalpels
and enzymatically disaggregated for 8 h at 37jC in EpiCult-B medium
(StemCell Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 300 units/
mL collagenase, and 100 units/mL hyaluronidase. After centrifugation at
450  g for 5 min, RBC were removed by pipetting in 0.64% NH4Cl. Singlecell suspensions were obtained by sequential pipetting for 1 to 2 min in
0.25% trypsin, followed by 2 min in 5 mg/mL dispase II plus 0.1 mg/mL
DNase I (Sigma). The resulting suspension was then filtered through a
40-Am mesh and subjected to removal of lineage positive cells using antiCD45, anti-TER119, and anti-CD31 antibodies to eliminate hematopoietic
and endothelial cells. Magnetic beads were used to enrich mammary
epithelial cells using the Mouse Mammary Stem Cell Enrichment Kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (StemCell Technologies). Following
the enrichment step, the resulting cell suspension was kept on ice until use.
Cell labeling, flow cytometry, and sorting. Antibody staining was done
in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were first
incubated with 1% BSA for 20 min at a cell concentration of 1  106/mL.
Cells were subsequently washed and stained with different conjugated
antibodies for 30 min, at dilutions predetermined by titration experiments.
Antibodies used in this study were antimouse CD24-phycoerythrin (clone
M1/69; BD Biosciences) and antimouse CD29-FITC (clone Ha2/5; BD
Biosciences). Following removal of excess unbound antibodies by washing
twice in PBS, the cells were resuspended in sorting buffer containing 1%
BSA and 1 mmol/L EDTA in PBS. The stained cells were subjected to
filtration through a 40-Am mesh and kept on ice until sorted. Flow
cytometry analysis and sorting was done with the MoFlo flow cytometer
(DakoCytomation). Forward scatter area versus forward scatter width
profiles were used to eliminate dead cells and cell doublets. Sorting was
done to achieve a final average purity of >95%.
Mammary gland transplantation. The no. 4 inguinal mammary gland
outgrowths, between nipple and lymph node, of Rag1 / (The Jackson
Laboratory) recipient mice were removed at 3 wk of age. Sorted cells were
spun down by low-speed centrifugation (850  g for 5 min) and
resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine. In all experiments, cell number and viability were confirmed
with the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Dilutions were done to achieve the
required number of viable cells for appropriate injection doses. Cells were
then mixed with BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a 1:1 ratio and injected
into cleared mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-wk-old Rag1 / recipient mice. To
minimize experimental variability due to potential differences in recipient
mice, control cell populations sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) were injected into the opposite flank of each animal.
In vitro epithelial progenitor assays. The colony-forming ability of
mammary epithelial progenitors was determined as previously described
(23–25). Sorted cells were cultured onto preseeded feeder layers, prepared
from irradiated (5  103 cGy) NIH 3T3 cells, at a clonal density of
f800/cm2, in EpiCult-B medium (StemCell Technologies) supplemented
with 5% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free EpiCult-B

Brca1/p53 and Chemoresistant Cancer Stem Cells
medium. In cases where CDDP was used, a predetermined GI50 value was
added to the culture for 48 h. Five to seven days later, cell colonies were fixed
with acetone/methanol (1:1), stained with Giemsa, and counted. Colonies
were counted from three replicate experiments and tabulated as the average
number of colonies per 100 primary cells.
Embryonic stem cell culture. E14 embryonic stem cell line was
cultured as described (26). Total RNA was prepared for reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and used as a positive control for Oct4
expression.
PCR and RT-PCR. Semiquantitative PCR reactions were done with 100 ng
of genomic DNA as template in a mixture containing 20 pmol of each genespecific primer. The PCR cycling conditions were done with an initial
denaturation step at 95jC for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 40 s at 94jC for
denaturation, 40 s at 60jC for annealing, and 1-min extension at 72jC,
followed by a final extension at 72jC for 7 min. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
analysis of total RNAs was done with the MasterAmp RT-PCR Kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies). Fifty nanograms of total RNA were used as templates for a
first strand synthesis at 60jC for 20 min. This single-tube reaction was then
subjected to 40 cycles of denaturation at 95jC for 40 s, annealing at 60jC for
40 s, and extension at 71jC for 1 min with a final extension of 7 min at 72jC.
Alternatively, 200 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA
using Oligo dT primer and the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting singlestrand cDNAs (1 AL) were either added to 25 AL of PCR reaction or stored at
20jC. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Statistical analysis. Results are presented as the mean F SD for at least
three repeated individual experiments for each group. Analyses were done
with the SPSS software. The percentages tumor-free mice were generated
using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Analyses were done with GraphPad
Prism software, which combines the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and the
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon method.

Results and Discussion
To investigate whether Brca1 mutation alters tumor chemotherapy response in vivo, we established p53- and Brca1/
p53–mutant mammary tumor models, respectively, using the
Cre/loxP system (12, 13). Nulliparous Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpMMTVCrea
females developed mammary tumors with complete penetrance
(11 of 11) between 11.8 and 16.7 months of age, with a median
tumor latency of 14.1 months, as compared with nulliparous
p53 fp/fpMMTVCrea females (n = 18), which developed tumors with
a median tumor latency of 16.9 months (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A).
Expression of MMTVCrea is restricted to a small number of cells in
the mammary gland (12). As previously shown, mammary tumor
latency varied depending partly on the numbers of targeted cells. In
nulliparous Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpWAPCrec mice, mammary tumors
developed between 3.7 and 9.5 months of age, with a median
tumor latency of 6.3 months and complete penetrance (39 of 39
mice), as compared with nulliparous p53 fp/fpWAPCrec mice (n = 18),
which have a median tumor latency of 10.6 months (P < 0.0001;
Fig. 1A). The median tumor latency in Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpK14Crec
mice, described by Liu and colleagues (14), is f7.0 months. Thus,
double knockout mouse strains harboring WAPCrec have a slightly
shorter median tumor latency compared with K14Cre mice. Whether
this is due to the usage of different promoters or the expression of
mutant p53 and BRCA1 proteins in our models is unclear. In
contrast to MMTVCrea , the WAPCrec is expressed in >90% of cells in
the adult mammary gland (12). The greater acceleration of
tumorigenesis by Brca1 mutation in WAPCrec mice when compared
with MMTVCrea is likely due to paracrine actions on cell
proliferation by the larger number of Brca1/p53–mutated cells.
Most mammary tumors that develop in mice with Brca1 and p53
mutations are either adenocarcinomas or spindle cell carcinomas

www.aacrjournals.org

(Supplementary Data), with the vast majority of tumors being
poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, similar to that of human
BRCA1-associated tumors. This observation correlates with the
previously reported Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fpK14Crec mice (14). In p53 fp/
fp
WAPCrec mice, soft tissue sarcomas, skin tumors, and osteosarcomas, in addition to mammary tumors, were detected in a small
number of mice (data not shown). In contrast, all Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fp
WAPCrec mice developed mammary tumors and only one case of
osteosarcoma was found in a cohort of 39 mice. Thus, mutations
of the Brca1 gene greatly shorten tumor latency as well as increase
selectivity of mammary tumor development.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with doxorubicin, CDDP, or
carboplatin. p53 fp/fp mouse mammary tumors were refractory to
doxorubicin or CDDP treatment at all doses tested (Fig. 1B, top).
Conversely, all Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fp mammary tumors (n = 19)
responded to an initial cycle of four injections of 1.5, 3, or 6 mg/
kg CDDP every other day for 7 days (Fig. 1B, bottom). Sensitivity to
CDDP treatment was observed in spontaneous tumors developed
in WAPCrec ; MMTVCrea mice, or in tumor transplants in Rag1 /
mice, indicating that Brca1 mutations render tumor cells sensitive
to platinum compounds regardless of which Cre transgenic
mice are assessed. Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fp mammary tumors were also
sensitive to treatment with 32.5 mg/kg (n = 3) or 60 mg/kg (n = 1)
carboplatin (data not shown). Taken together, a differential
sensitivity of spontaneous Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fp mammary tumors to
platinum over doxorubicin was found in vivo, consistent with the
reported observation in a BRCA1-deficient human breast cancer
cell line (11).
Sensitivity to platinum treatment (24–48 hours posttreatment)
correlated with increased immunostaining of activated caspase-3,
which showed cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization (Fig. 1C).
Phospho-histone 3 expression, marker of the mitotic phase of
the cell cycle, was decreased in CDDP-treated cells (Fig. 1C).
Rad51 foci that formed at DNA double-strand breaks were
detected 48 hours after CDDP treatment in p53 fp/fp tumors
(Fig. 1D). In contrast, no Rad51 foci were detected in Brca1 fp/fp
p53 fp/fp tumors. Thus, lack of homologous recombinational
repair correlates with increased cell death and reduced mitotic
cells in the favorable response to cisplatin. Recent studies showed
that BRCA-deficient cancer cells are profoundly sensitized to
inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in vitro (9). Poly(ADPribose) polymerase 1 binds to ssDNA breaks and may lead to
persistent DNA lesions, preventing repair by homologous
recombination pathways. Indeed, silencing of BRCA1 or BRCA2
network genes in p53-deficient, but not p53-proficient, cells
enhances sensitivity to cisplatin (27). Taken together, BRCA1 and
p53 deficiency leads to selective sensitivity to specific types of
chemotherapeutic drug.
Because with doxorubicin treatment Brca1 fp/fpp53 fp/fp mammary
tumors had only a transient slowing down of tumor growth,
subsequent studies focused on CDDP-treated mice. Using a lower
CDDP dose (0.5 mg/kg; n = 8), 80% of tumors had complete
pathologic response to the initial treatment cycle (Fig. 2A) and 20%
had only partial regression for 11 to 12 days followed by rapid
growth (data not shown), indicating that there is heterogeneity in
the initial cisplatin response at the lower CDDP dosage. Following
the initial tumor shrinkage and complete pathologic response,
tumors relapsed at the same site f2 to 3 months posttreatment.
Relapse also occurred in mice treated with higher dosages of CDDP
(data not shown). To address whether recurrent tumors remain
sensitive to platinum compounds, a second round of cisplatin

treatment was done in three mice (Fig. 2A and data not shown).
Tumor shrinkage was observed initially but tumors recurred with a
more rapid growth rate than the original relapsed tumor following
1 week of complete regression (Fig. 2A). Rapid recurrence and
growth suggest the existence of a subpopulation of cisplatinresistant cells and selection of the resistant cells during successive
platinum treatment.
Previous studies have shown that cancer stem cells contribute to
cancer recurrence and chemoresistance in several tumor types. To
investigate whether cancer stem cells contribute to platinum
resistance, we first tested whether markers for normal mammary
stem cells could be used to enrich mammary cancer stem cells.
CD24, a heat-stable antigen, is expressed in human breast
tumors and neural stem cells. Sleeman and colleagues (28) divided
the CD24-expressing normal mammary cells into three subgroups
(i.e., CD24low, CD24med, and CD24hi) and showed that cells with the
highest repopulation capacity resided in the CD24med population.
CD29 (h1-integrin), a stem cell marker in skin, was found to be

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

expressed at a very high level in normal mouse mammary stem
cells (25). Thus, we characterized the CD29hiCD24med cells that
represented 3.8% to 8.0% (mean, 5.9%) of tumor cell population in
primary tumors that arose following CDDP treatment (Fig. 2B).
Cells analyzed from untreated primary tumors had a mean of 1.5%
CD29hiCD24med cells (data not shown). Injections of 1,000 (5 of 5)
and 500 (4 of 6) CD29hiCD24med cells from the resistant primary
tumors into fat pads of immunodeficient mice gave rise to tumors,
whereas injections of 1,000 CD29med24hi cells (0 of 4) did not
(Fig. 2C). One of five injections of CD29med24 /lo resulted in small
tumors. This is perhaps due to the presence of small numbers of
contaminating cells from the CD29hiCD24med population. Alternatively, the CD29med24 /lo population may contain a small number
of cells with limited proliferative ability. Thus, cancer cells
expressing high level of CD29 and intermediate level of CD24
are more likely to represent the cancer stem cell subpopulation
because they showed a greater repopulation capacity than
CD29med24 /lo or CD29med24hi. In the normal mammary fat pad,

a single CD29hiCD24+ cell is capable of reconstituting a functional
mammary gland (25). Importantly, the CD29hiCD24med cells
give rise to tumors that express a wide range of CD29 and CD24
(Fig. 2D).
To systematically investigate the role of CD29hiCD24med cells in
cisplatin resistance, we investigated whether tumors that
developed in Rag1 / mice, following transplantation of FACSsorted tumor cells, respond to platinum treatment. Treatment of
first-round primary transplants (n = 10) resulted only in partial
regression (Fig. 3A, dotted line). Importantly, secondary tumor
transplants (n = 7) generated from CD29hiCD24med cells were
completely refractory to CDDP treatment (Fig. 3A, solid line),
suggesting an increase in CDDP-resistant cells compared with the
primary transplant tumor. Rottenberg and colleagues (29)
reported that they were unable to identify resistance to CDDP
when they performed transplantations using tumor pieces. They,
however, also failed to eliminate the tumors, suggesting the
potential existence of CDDP-resistant, tumor-initiating cells. In
our study, we showed that these cells are enriched in the
CD29hi24med subpopulation. To test whether there were expansions of these cancer stem cells, we compared profiles of CD29
and CD24 in tumor cells from the primary and secondary tumor
transplants. The frequency of CD29hiCD24med cells ranged from
6.6% to 11.0% (mean, 8.8%; n = 10) in the primary transplants and
from 16.5% to 29.2% (mean, 22.8%, n = 7) in the secondary tumor
transplants (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Thus, there is an f3fold increase in the frequency of CD29hiCD24med cells in the
secondary tumor transplants compared with the primary transplants, suggesting that the expansion of the CD29hiCD24med
population may contribute to platinum resistance. Because
frequencies of CD29hiCD24med cell populations in primary transplants are comparable to those in recurrent and primary tumors,

it is unlikely that expansion of these populations in the secondary
tumor transplants is due to transplantation per se. To confirm this,
we carried out FACS analysis on primary and secondary transplant
tumors that were not treated with CDDP. Results showed that the
percentage of CD29hiCD24med in these tumors remained low, within
the range of 3.5% to 9.8% (mean, 6.6%; n = 5). Importantly, in the
CDDP-treated tumors, the CD29hiCD24med cells gave rise to
heterogeneous cell populations, expressing wide ranges of CD24
and CD29 (Fig. 3B), indicating that the regenerated tumors
contained phenotypically diverse populations of cells, as one would
expect from cancer stem cells.
In addition to assaying the potential of cancer stem cells to
regenerate tumors in vivo, we also carried out in vitro colonyforming assays on CD29hiCD24med cells. Colony formation assay
has previously been used for estimation of progenitor numbers
in a cell population (23–25). CD29hiCD24med cells have f3- and
6-fold higher colony-forming efficiencies on irradiated NIH 3T3
feeder layers than CD29med 24 /lo and CD29med24hi cells,
respectively (Fig. 3C). In a separate experiment, a low colonyforming ability was seen with unsorted cells (Fig. 3D, shaded
column). These independent experiments provided further
evidence that the CD29hiCD24med population contained higher
numbers of mammary progenitor cells. In the unsorted
population, cells harvested from the second transplant were
3-fold enriched for colony formation compared with cells from
the first transplant (Fig. 3D). This observation corroborates the
findings from the FACS analyses where a 3-fold increase in the
CD29hiCD24med subpopulation was observed in the secondary
transplant. These colonies were also larger (Fig. 3D, bottom),
suggesting increased proliferation of cancer stem cells following
secondary transplantation. To explore the possibility that this
population of cells were also CDDP resistant, we added CDDP at

a predetermined GI50 concentration to the culture in the colony
assay. Interestingly, f22% of the colonies from the second
transplant were resistant to CDDP treatment, compared with
<1% from the first transplant (Fig. 3D), strongly suggesting an
expansion of CDDP-resistant progenitor cells in the second
transplant population.
To investigate the involvement of key regulators in self-renewal
and pluripotency in these CD29hiCD24med populations, we carried
out semiquantitative RT-PCR for Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, critical
players for the pluripotent embryonic stem cells (reviewed in ref.
30). Sox2 and Oct4 expression was low in all the samples from
primary as well as secondary tumor transplants, whereas Oct4
expression was readily detectable in the embryonic stem cells
(Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, Nanog was readily detectable in
these cells, particularly in the primary tumor transplant, whereas

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

Nanog expression was reduced in CD29hiCD24med populations of
the secondary tumor transplants. Lin and colleagues (31) showed
that Nanog expression is suppressed by p53, leading to mouse
embryonic stem cell differentiation. In our mouse model,
conditional deletion of p53 may contribute to Nanog upregulation. On the other hand, in contrast to normal stem cells,
Nanog may no longer be subject to Sox2-Oct4 transcriptional
regulation in cancer stem cells.
We also examined MDR1 and Top2A expression in primary and
secondary tumor transplants by semiquantitative RT-PCR. MDR1
expression was low or below detection in all cases (Fig. 4A).
However, whereas high levels of Top2A expression were seen in
primary transplants, expression was greatly reduced in all
secondary transplants examined (Fig. 4A and data not shown).
Genomic deletion of Top2A was seen in one of the secondary

tumors (Fig. 4C). Whereas differential gene expression was
detected in primary and secondary tumor transplants, mechanisms
leading to chemoresistance remain to be addressed. It should be
noted that down-regulation of Top2A has been observed in
postchemotherapy samples compared with the primary tumors
(32), suggesting its possible contribution to chemoresistance.
However, it should also be noted that expression of Top2A has
been associated with both cisplatin resistance and sensitivity in
ovarian cancer in different studies (33, 34). Therefore, the
predictive power of Top2A in BRCA1-associated tumors has yet
to be elucidated.
Taken together, exposure to CDDP may lead to the emergence of
a subpopulation of mouse tumor cells (i.e., CD29hiCD24med) that
become resistant to CDDP (Fig. 4D). Alternatively, a small
population of preexisting cells with inherent CDDP resistance
survives CDDP treatment. Following subsequent exposure to CDDP,

these resistant cells self-renew as well as differentiate into tumor
masses containing cells of various phenotypes. Transplantation of
this subpopulation of cells into immunodeficient mice led to its
further expansion. Up-regulation of c-Myc was detected in the
CD29hiCD24med population in the primary, but not secondary,
tumor transplant. Whether c-myc and Nanog are involved in the
expansion, but not maintenance, of the CD29hiCD24med cancer stem
cell populations remains to be addressed.
Studies by Rottenberg and colleagues (29) used a model with null
alleles of Brca1 and p53, whereas the model described here
expressed exon 11–less isoforms of Brca1. The CDDP treatment
regimen also differs in the two studies. A 20-day recovery preceded
each single injection of CDDP reported by Rottenberg and colleagues
(29). Tumors were not eliminated under the regimen, indicating the
existence of chemoresistant cells. The spontaneous chemoresistant
model described here allows a longitudinal follow-up of putative

Clearly, the platinum-resistant CD29hiCD24med cancer stem cells not
only expanded but presumably also increased their proliferation
rates relative to the total population of tumor cells during the
treatment course.
