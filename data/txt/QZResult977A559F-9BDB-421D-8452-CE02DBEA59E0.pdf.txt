ABSTRACT
Acquired resistance to standard therapies remains a serious challenge, requiring
novel therapeutic approaches that incorporate potential factors involved in tumor
resistance. As cancers including melanoma express inflammatory cyclooxygenases
generating prostaglandins implicated in tumor growth, we investigated mechanism
of anti-inflammatory drug, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) which has been shown to inhibit
various tumor types, however, its effects against highly aggressive melanoma
model are unclear. Given our reports that an activation of platelet-activating factorreceptor (PAF-R) augments the growth and impede efficacies of therapeutic agents
in experimental melanoma, we also sought to determine if PAF-R mediates antimelanoma activity of ASA. The current studies using stably PAF-R-positive (B16PAFR) and negative (B16-MSCV) murine melanoma cells and PAF-R-expressing
and deficient mice, demonstrate that ASA inhibits the in-vitro and in-vivo growth
of highly aggressive B16F10 melanoma via bypassing tumoral or stromal PAF-R
signaling. Similar ASA-induced effects in-vitro were seen in human melanoma and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells positive or negative in PAF-R. Mechanistically, the
ASA-induced decrease in cell survival and increase in apoptosis were significantly
blocked by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2α) agonists. Importantly, PCR array and
qRT-PCR analysis of B16-tumors revealed significant downregulation of sry-related
high-mobility-box-2 (SOX2) oncogene by ASA treatment. Interestingly, modulation
of SOX2 expression by PGF2α agonists and upregulation by fibroblast growth factor 1
(FGF-1) rescued melanoma cells from ASA-induced decreased survival and increased
apoptosis. Moreover, PGF2α-receptor antagonist, AL8810 mimics ASA-induced
decreased melanoma cells survival which was significantly blocked by PGF2α and
FGF-1. These findings indicate that ASA inhibits the growth of aggressive melanoma
via SOX2-dependent-PAF-R-indepedent pathway.

the most promise as the immune responses are critical
for the eradication of melanoma [7–8]. Importantly, most
standard therapies for cancers including melanoma also act
as potent pro-oxidative stressors by which they eradicate
tumor cells as one of the potent mechanisms [9–13].
Our previous studies have shown that an activation
of platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAF-R), a seven
transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor mediates
pro-oxidative stressors-induced acute pro-inflammatory

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive type
of skin cancer that contributes about 80% of skin-cancerrelated deaths leading to over 9000 annual mortality in
the United States [1]. Melanomas are often resistant to
standard therapies including the new targeted therapies,
indicating the need of novel approaches for its intervention
[2–6]. In contrast, immunotherapy strategies have shown

and delayed systemic immunosuppressive responses
[12–23]. The PAF-R is expressed on various immune
and non-immune cells including keratinocytes and
tumor cells [12–23]. Importantly, PAF-R activation by
pro-oxidative stressors including the therapeutic agents,
augment the growth and impede cancer therapy efficacy
in experimental murine melanoma models in a process
blocked by cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors
[16–19]. Cyclooxygenases (COX) enzyme catalyzes the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs)
[24–26].
Most importantly, malignancies including melanoma
express COX-2 and, inhibition of COX-2 or its generated
PGs have been shown to exert promising anti-tumor
effects against melanoma [24–27]. Prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2α) are the major
PGs involved in mediating several behaviors of cancer
cells including the cell proliferation and invasion [26, 45].
Thus, there has been considerable rationale for the use of
anti-cancer drug(s) targeting COX-2 or PGs for cancer
chemoprevention [28–30].
Notably, aspirin, an acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has
classically been used as an anti-inflammatory drug due to
its ability to inhibit COX enzymes resulting in decreased
synthesis of PGs, and thus, possesses chemopreventive
activities against a variety of cancers [30–36]. While
some studies have demonstrated ASA-effects in syngeneic
murine B16F0 or B16F1 melanoma models [37–40], its
role and mechanism in a highly aggressive and syngeneic
B16F10 murine melanoma model that resembles the
aggressive and advanced melanoma in humans are unclear.
Of significance, in clinical studies, where administration of
ASA has been shown to reduce the risk of human cancers
including gastric and colon cancer, there have been mixed
results regarding the use of ASA and melanoma risk [41–
43]. Thus, an investigation of ASA mechanism of action
in a highly aggressive melanoma model is necessary to
further evaluate its efficacy, identify novel target(s) and
define the rationale for its use in combination therapy.
Among various factors involved in inducing tumor
resistance or anti-apoptotic responses to standard therapies
against cancers, sry-related high-mobility box -2 (SOX-2)
gene has emerged as an important oncogene which affects
tumor cell behavior including proliferation, apoptosis and
resistance to standard therapies [44–47]. While SOX2
expression has been identified in cancer models [44–49],
there is only limited information of SOX2 in melanoma.
Moreover, the role of ASA in modulating SOX2
expression in melanoma model has not been studied.
As ASA targets both COX-dependent and
independent pathways [50–51], the current studies sought
to determine the role and mechanism of ASA in B16F10
melanoma model. The present studies describe a novel
mechanism by which ASA suppresses the in-vitro and
in-vivo growth B16F10 melanoma tumors via SOX2dependent-PAF-R-independent pathway.

Aspirin inhibits the survival of murine
melanoma cells via inducing apoptosis
Given our studies demonstrating the role of
PAF-R signaling in melanoma tumor growth [16–20],
we first tested the involvement of PAF-R pathway in
ASA-induced effects. To that end, we utilized stable
PAF-R-positive (B16-PAFR) and negative (B16-MSCV,
for control) cells generated via retroviral-mediated
transduction of parent B16F10 melanoma cells. The
generation and characterization of these cells have been
described by us [17]. As shown in Figure 1A-1C, ASA
treatment (0.1 to 10 mM) suppressed the survival of
these cells at similar rates in a dose and time dependent
manner with an IC50 of 5mM at 72 hours as measured
via a quantitative sulforhodamine (SRB) assay [52]. Our
next studies used the IC50 dose of ASA at 72 hour time
point and demonstrated that ASA-mediated inhibition of
these melanoma cell survival was due to the induction
of apoptosis as measured by immunoblotting for
cleaved caspase 3, luminescence and fluorescence-based
caspase-3/7 activity (Figure 1D-1E and Supplementary
Figure 1). Our next functional studies investigated if
PAF-R activation by known PAF-R agonist, CPAF could
rescue ASA-induced decreased growth and increased
apoptosis of melanoma cells. We observed that while
CPAF-alone treatment increased the proliferation of B16PAFR cells, it did not rescue the cells from ASA-induced
reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis (Figure
2A-2D). Similarly, ASA treatments inhibited the survival
of human PAF-R-negative SK5MEL melanoma and
PAF-R-positive KBP and negative KBM nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells (Supplementary Figure 2A-2F) generated
via retroviral-mediated transduction as reported by us [18–
19, 52]. These findings indicate that ASA-induced effects
bypass cellular-PAF-R signaling in melanoma cells and
these effects are not specific to murine melanoma.

ASA suppresses the in-vivo growth of melanoma
tumors
We have shown that an activation of stromal (host)PAF-R mediates augmentation of melanoma tumor growth
[17]. Our next studies determined effects of ASA on in-vivo
melanoma tumor growth with the focus of investigating the
role of host-PAF-R. To that end, we first performed pilot
studies to determine the optimal dose of ASA that inhibits
melanoma tumor growth. Our pilot studies in WT mice
(n=5/group) demonstrate that supplementation of ASA
(2.8, 5.6 and 11.1 mmol/L in 0.2% DMSO) in drinking
water inhibits B16-MSCV tumor growth compared to
vehicle (0.2% DMSO) in a dose-dependent manner without
exerting deleterious effects (Supplementary Figure 3A-3B).
The greater tumor suppressive effects were seen with

11.1 mmol/L dose of ASA. We next evaluated effects
of 11.1 mmol/L dose of ASA on the growth of B16MSCV and B16-PAFR tumors in WT mice (n=10 mice per
groups) as outlined in Figure 3A. We observed that ASAtreatment significantly suppressed the growth of both B16MSCV and B16-PAFR tumors at similar rates indicating
that ASA-induced effects bypass cellular and host-PAF-R
(Figure 3B-3C). To further confirm the involvement of hostPAF-R signaling, we performed studies in PAF-R deficient
(PAFR-/-) mice (10 mice/group) and observed similar
growth inhibition of B16-MSCV and B16-PAFR tumors
by ASA (Figure 3D-3E). These studies indicate that ASAinduced suppression of in-vivo melanoma tumor growth
bypasses cellular and stromal PAFR signaling.

including cell proliferation and invasion [26, 50]. Our next
studies with an objectives of determining the mechanism
of ASA-induced decreased growth of melanoma cells,
evaluated the roles of PGE2 and PGF2α. Our further in-vitro
studies used B16-MSCV cells with ASA at IC50 dose of
5mM at 72 hour. To that end, we performed initial studies
to test various working doses of PGE2 and PGF2α which
by itself do not affect the cell viability (data not shown)
and chosen 1.0 μg/ml dose. Next, B16-MSCV cells were
cultured with PGE2 and PGF2α at 1.0 μg/ml concentration
and cultured for 24 hour followed by treatment with or
without ASA at 5mM dose and cultured for 72 hour. We
observed that PGF2α but not PGE2 significantly protected
B16-MSCV cells from ASA-induced reduced survival
(Figure 4A-4B). We next tested if PGF2α could rescue
the cells from ASA-induced apoptosis. As shown in
Figure 4C, ASA-induced increase cleavage of caspase-3
was significantly blocked by PGF2α agonist, indicating
its potential role in ASA-induced apoptosis. Our studies
also demonstrate an inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein

PGF2α but not PGE2 protected melanoma cells

Among various PGs, PGE2 and PGF2α are the major
PGs involved in mediating several behaviors of cancer cells

B16F10 cells stably expressing PAF-R (B16-PAFR) or deficient, vector control (B16-MSCV) cells were treated with various doses of ASA
(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 8.0 and 10 mM) and cultured for 24, 48 and 72 hour. Control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO only.
At these time points, cells were fixed and cell survival was assessed via staining with sulforhodamine B (SRB) as described. (D-E) B16MSCV and B16-PAFR cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or 5 mM ASA and cultured for 72 hour followed by the detection of cleaved
caspase-3 for apoptosis induction normalized to β-actin for control by western blotting (the fold change in cleaved caspase 3 between
DMSO and ASA treated cells is shown for quantification) or luminescence-based caspase-3/7 activity normalized to 0.5 mg of total protein
by plate reader as described. Data are the mean ± SD and expressed as % cell survival or caspase 3/7 activity/mg protein over the doses of
ASA from at least three separate experiments. Statistical significant difference (p<0.05) was noted in caspase 3/7 activity between vehicle
and ASA-treated B16-MSCV and B16-PAFR cells (Figure 1E).

indicating its role in protecting melanoma cells from ASAinduced apoptosis (Figure 4D).

unaltered, we observed 10 fold downregulation of sryrelated high-mobility-box-2 (SOX2) oncogene by ASA
treatment compared to control (Figure 5B). We confirmed
this finding by performing separate qRT-PCR studies for
SOX2 gene in individual B16-MSCV tumors from vehicle
and ASA-treated WT mice and observed similar findings
(Figure 5C). These studies indicate that SOX2 mediates
ASA-induced decreased growth of melanoma tumors and
thus, further studies were focused on SOX2.

SOX2 mediates ASA-induced decreased growth
of melanoma tumors in-vivo
As COX-independent mechanisms have also been
proposed for ASA-induced effects [50–51], our next
approach was to identify the target(s) that mediate ASAinduced reduced growth of melanoma tumors. To that
end, we performed PCR array analysis using B16-MSCV
tumors isolated from vehicle and ASA-treated WT mice
(n=10 mice/group) (Figure 5A) as described in the method
section. While the expression of most of the genes were

SOX2 in mediating ASA-induced effects. To that

described. Data are the mean ± SD and expressed as % cell proliferation or caspase 3/7 activity/mg protein in various groups from at least

end, B16-MSCV cells were pretreated PGF2α agonist
(1.0 μg/ml) and left for 24 hour followed by treatment
with 0.1% DMSO or 5mM ASA. After 72 hours, the
analysis of SOX2 gene was performed by qRT-PCR and
western blotting. As shown in Figure 6A-6B, treatment
with ASA decreased the expression and protein levels of
SOX2, further confirming the in-vivo PCR array data with
B16-MSCV tumors (Figure 5B-5C). Importantly, PGF2α
treatment attenuated ASA-induced reduction in SOX2
gene expression (Figure 6A-6B) and apoptosis induction
(Figure 6C).

calvarial osteoblast cells in a time dependent manner with
substantial increase was noted at 24 hour [53]. We first
tested if the same dosing regimen (10ng/ml) of FGF-1
at 24 hour could induce SOX2 in melanoma cells? To
that end, B16-MSCV cells were treated with or without
FGF-1 and after 24 hours, total RNA was extracted and
cDNA samples were analyzed for SOX2 expression
by qRT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH. As shown
in Figure 7A, we observed significant upregulation in
SOX2 gene expression. In next studies, B16-MSCV cells
were pretreated with FGF-1 (10ng/ml) and after 24 hour
treated with 0.1% DMSO or 5mM ASA and cultured for
72 hour followed by assessments of cell survival and
apoptosis by SRB and caspase-3/7 activity assays. Our
studies demonstrate that FGF-1 treatment that upregulates
SOX2, significantly blocked ASA-induced reduction in
cell survival and induction of apoptosis (Figure 7B-7C).
These findings indicate that SOX2 mediates ASA-induced
decreased growth of murine melanoma cells.

SOX-2 upregulation blocks ASA-induced effects
We next investigated if SOX2 upregulation can
rescue melanoma cells from ASA-induced inhibition
of cell survival and induction of apoptosis. Notably,
fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) treatment has been
shown to upregulate SOX2 expression in murine primary

rescue melanoma cells from AL8810-induced inhibition
of survival, and compared the responses with ASA. For
this, B16-MSCV cells were pretreated with PGF2α and
FGF-1 and left for 24 hour followed by the treatments
with 0.1% DMSO, AL8810 (300μM) or ASA (5mM).
After 72 hours, cell survival was assessed by SRB
assay. As shown in Figure 8B, both PGF2α and FGF1 significantly attenuated AL8810-induced reduced
survival of melanoma cells similar to as seen with ASAtreatment. In addition, pretreatment with AL8810 at
lower dose (0.5 μM, denoted by *) that does not affect
the cell viability, significantly attenuated ASA-induced
inhibition of cell survival (Figure 8B) indicating that
blockade of FP receptor abrogates ASA-induced effects
in B16-MSCV cells. These findings suggest that SOX2
signaling pathway mediates ASA-induced decreased
growth of melanoma growth (Figure 8C).

As ASA-induced effects were blocked by
modulation of SOX2 by PGF2α and FGF-1 in melanoma
cells (Figures 6-7), we next investigated if PGF2α-FP
receptor antagonist, AL8810 [54–55] can mimic ASA
effects and if SOX-2 upregulation can abrogate its
effect? To that end, our first studies evaluated effects
of AL8810 on the survival of B16-MSCV cells. For
this, melanoma cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or
various doses of AL8810 (0.5μM to 500μM) and after
72 hour, cell survival was analyzed by SRB assay. As
shown in Figure 8A, AL8810 treatment reduces the
survival of B16-MSCV cells in a dose dependent manner
with an IC50 of 300μM. Our next studies determined if
PGF2α and FGF-1 that modulate SOX2 expression, can

including gastric and colon cancer, mixed responses have
been reported regarding ASA in reducing the risk of
melanoma [41–43]. Thus, an evaluation and identification
of novel target(s) of ASA in highly aggressive syngeneic
melanoma model will result in new therapeutic strategy
for melanoma chemoprevention.
The present studies tested the role and mechanisms
of ASA in highly aggressive and syngeneic B16F10
melanoma model. Notably, where B16F0 and B16F1
murine melanoma cells are non-aggressive, B16F10 cells

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), the common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) household drug
has been used for decades as an anti-inflammatory,
analgesic and anti-pyretic agent [30, 50]. In addition, ASA
effects as an antithrombotic agent have been established
against stroke and cardiovascular diseases [56–57].
Importantly, while clinical studies have demonstrated that
administration of ASA reduces the risk of human cancers

are the highly aggressive murine melanoma model which
resembles the malignant stage of advanced melanoma in
humans. Importantly, published studies have used either
B16F0 or B16F1 melanoma cells in determining ASAinduced effects on in-vitro and/or in-vivo melanoma
growth [37–40]. Our studies using murine B16F10
melanoma cells demonstrated that ASA inhibits the
in-vitro and in-vivo growth of melanoma tumors via
bypassing the PAF-R pathway. These studies are consistent
with our published report demonstrating that augmentation
of murine EL4 lymphoma tumor growth bypasses the
PAF-R signaling [16]. As induction of apoptosis is an
important phenomenon in mediating the chemopreventive
activities of anti-tumor agents [11–12, 50, 52], our studies
demonstrate that ASA-treatment induces apoptosis to
inhibit the survival of melanoma cells. These findings
are consistent with other studies demonstrating that ASA
induced apoptosis to inhibit the growth of cancer cells
[32–33, 35].
Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase or COX
is an enzyme with multiple isoforms (COX-1 and
COX-2) that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
acid to prostaglandins (PGs), one of the major pathways
implicated in mediating inflammatory responses and/
or affecting tumor growth [25–26, 50]. This inhibition
of COX enzymes decreases the catalytic production
of PGs and several studies have shown that COX-2
inhibition by ASA suppresses cancer growth [30, 32].
Among various PGs, PGE2 and PGF2α synthesis play
crucial roles, particularly relevant to several cancer cell
specific processes including proliferation, invasion and

resistance to apoptosis [25, 29–30, 41]. Our studies
demonstrate that pretreatment of PGF2α but not PGE2
significantly protected melanoma cells from ASAinduced decreased cell survival, Bcl-XL and increased
apoptosis. Although significant but an incomplete
rescue of ASA-induced effects on cell survival, Bcl-XL
and apoptosis by PGF2α may suggest the involvement
of other factor(s) in mediating ASA-induced effects
which remains the goal of future studies. These
findings are consistent with the studies of Tsai et al
demonstrating that ASA-treatment decreased PGF2α
production in B16F0 cells which reduced its migration
and invasion via inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-2 activity [38].
Notably, COX-dependent and independent pathways
have been proposed for ASA-induced effects in various
tumor types including B16F0 and B16F1 melanoma
models [30–40, 43, 50]. To identify the target(s) and
mechanism of ASA involved in inhibiting the in-vitro and
in-vivo growth of B16F10 melanoma, we took advantage
of the PCR array analysis. Our studies demonstrate 10
fold downregulation of SOX2 gene by ASA treatment.
Further qRT-PCR analysis of B16-MSCV tumors
confirmed the PCR array data analysis for the expression
of SOX2 gene.
SOX2 gene encodes for a transcription factor
which belong to SOX gene family and functions as
an activator or suppressor of the gene transcription
[44]. Earlier studies have shown that SOX2 plays
crucial role in several processes including stem cell
maintenance and cellular reprograming and its alteration

induces developmental maladies such as anophthalmiaesophageal-genital (AEG) syndrome [44, 53]. In regard
to cancer, recent studies have shown that SOX2 is
amplified in various cancer types that affect cancer
cell physiology including proliferation, apoptosis and
resistance to standard therapies [44–47]. While the role
of SOX2 has been identified in various cancer models
including melanoma [44–49], it is not studied whether
ASA can modulate SOX2 expression in melanoma
model. Our studies demonstrate that ASA treatment
inhibits SOX2 gene expression and modulation of
SOX2 by PGF2α attenuates ASA-induced inhibition of
survival and induction of apoptosis in murine B16F10
melanoma cells. Importantly, SOX2 upregulation
by FGF-1 promoted the survival of melanoma cells
and significantly blocked ASA-induced reduced cell

survival and increased apoptosis. These findings are
in agreement with studies demonstrating that SOX2
promotes tumorigenesis and increases the anti-apoptotic
property of cancer cells and its downregulation inhibits
cancer growth [47–49]. Furthermore, our studies show
that SOX-2 upregulation blocks FP receptor antagonist
effects which mimics ASA-induced effects in inhibiting
the survival of melanoma cells.
In summary, the present studies describe a novel
mechanism by which ASA suppresses the in-vitro and
in-vivo growth of highly aggressive B16F10 melanoma
tumors via SOX2-dependent-PAF-R independent signaling
pathway. Importantly, as SOX2 play crucial roles in tumorresistance or anti-apoptotic responses to standard therapies,
our studies indicate that anti-SOX2 targeting agent(s) could
further be tested for melanoma chemoprevention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

48 hour and 72 hour by sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay, as
described by us previously [52]. In separate experiments,
B16-MSCV and B16-PAFR cells were cultured with or
without PGE2 or PGF2α (1.0 μg/ml) for 24 hour followed
by treatment with or without 5mM ASA and after 72
hour, cell survival was assessed. In addition, B16-MSCV
cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or various doses of
AL8810 (0.5 μM to 500 μM) in serum-free media and after
72 hour cell survival was measured. Next, B16-MSCV
cells were pretreated with PGF2α (1.0 μg/ml) or FGF-1
(10 ng/ml) and left for 24 hour followed by treatments
with 0.1% DMSO or AL8810 (0.5 μM & 300 μM) or ASA
(5 mM) in serum-free media and 72 hour later cell survival
was analyzed by SRB assay [52].

Materials and reagents
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise. The Qiagen
RNA extraction kit and RT2 ProfilerTM PCR array were
purchased from Qiagen Sciences (Germantown, MD).
The cDNA kit and SYBR green qPCR reagent were
purchased from Life technologies (Carlsbad, CA). The
PAF-R, SOX2 and GAPDH primers were obtained from
SABiosciences (Valencia, CA). Caspase-3/7 activity assay
kit was purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison,
WI). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and F2α (PGF2α) were
purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co. (Ann Arbor, MI).
Antibodies against cleaved caspase-3, SOX2, β-actin were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA).

Cell proliferation assay
The B16-MSCV and B16-PAFR cells were
plated in 24-well plates (2x104 cells/well) and treated
with 10 nM 1-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamoy l-3glycerophosphocholine (CPAF) and/or 5mM ASA and
incubated for 72 hour. The control cells received 0.1%
DMSO. After 72 hour, cells were trypsinized, washed
and resuspended in media. The cell proliferation was
assessed by standard trypan blue exclusion method using
a Countess automated cell counter (Life technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) [52].

Cells
Murine parent PAF-R negative B16F10 melanoma
cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) used
to generate stably PAF-R-expressing (B16-PAFR)
and deficient (B16-MSCV) cells as described by us
[17–18]. Similarly, PAF-R-positive and deficient KBP
and KBM cells generated from PAF-R-negative human
nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells were used in these
studies [14–15, 17–19]. In addition, PAF-R-deficient
human melanoma SK5MEL cells obtained from ATCC
were used. These cells were maintained in DMEM
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
100 μg/ml mixture of penicillin and streptomycin as
described by us [14–15, 17–19, 52] and tested during
the course of the study for their authenticity and were
used at 12-32 passage numbers.

Apoptosis assay
The B16-MSCV or B16-PAF-R cells (1×105 cells/
well) were seeded into 6-well plates with or without
PGF2α (1.0 μg/ml) and after 24 hour treated with 0.1%
DMSO or 5 mM ASA in serum-free media. After 72 hour,
cells were homogenized in hypotonic extraction buffer and
0.5 mg of total protein was incubated with caspase-3/7 glo
reagent (Promega, Madison WI) as described by us [52,
59]. The caspase 3/7 activity was measured by Synergy H1
Luminescence microplate reader (BioTek, Winvooski, VT)
at our Proteome Analysis Laboratory (PAL) core facilities.
In addition, we confirmed ASA-induced apoptosis
induction by detecting cleaved caspase-3 by western
blotting and/or used fluorescence-based caspase-3/7
activity assay as markers of apoptosis using Incucyte
instrument (Essen Bioscience) according to the manual’s
protocol. In separate experiments, B16-MSCV cells were
pretreated with FGF-1 (10 ng/ml) and cultured for 24 hour
followed by treatment with 0.1% DMSO or 5 mM ASA.
After 72 hour, caspase-3/7 activity was assessed [52, 59].

Mice
PAF-R expressing C57BL/6 wildtype (WT) and
PAF-R knockout mice (Ptafr-/-) mice (originally obtained
from Dr. Satoshi Ishii, The University of Tokyo [58] on
C57BL/6 background. These mice strains (50% males
and females) at the age of 8-12 weeks were used in these
studies. All mice were housed under specific pathogenfree conditions. All procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright
State University.

Cell survival assay

Western blot analysis

The B16-MSCV and B16-PAFR cells were seeded
into 96-well plates (2x103 cells/well) and cultured
overnight followed by treatment with 0.1% DMSO or
various concentrations of ASA (1-10 mM) in serumfree media, as indicated in respective figures and figure
legends. The cell survival was assessed at 24 hour,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

B16-PAF-R and/or B16-MSCV cells (0.75x106)
were seeded in 100mm disc with or without PGF2α
(1.0 μg/ml) and cultured for 24 hour followed by treatment
with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) or 5mM ASA in serum free
media and left for 72 hours. Whole-cell extracts were

prepared and cell lysates containing 40-60 μg proteins
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF
membrane for western blot analysis as described by us
previously [59] for the analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and
SOX2 and normalized by β-actin. The quantitation of
immunoblots was done using Image lab 5.1 software from
Biorad Chemidoc MP imaging system (Hercules, CA) at
our Proteome Analysis Laboratory (PAL) core facilities.

each tumor sample was pooled separately from each
group. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
using cDNA synthesis kit and blotted separately into RT2
ProfilerTM PCR array plates (PAMM-176Zc-2 for mouse
cancer stem cells) and qPCR and analysis were performed
as per manual’s protocol and software.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)

Statistical analysis was assessed by Graph Pad
Prism 5.0 software. All in-vitro experiments were repeated
independently at least three times and at least five mice/
group were used in murine experiments. Data were
analyzed by Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with post
hoc Bonferroni’s or Newman-Keuls multiple comparison
tests. Statistical significance was set as a p value <0.05.

Statistical analysis

The mRNA expression of Bcl-XL and SOX2 was
analyzed in reverse transcribed cDNA from DNA-digested
total RNA extracted from B16-MSCV cells treated with
0.1% DMSO or 5 mM ASA using qPCR and the data were
normalized with GAPDH as described by us [17, 59–60].
Similarly, B16-MSCV tumors (n=10 mice/group) harvested
from vehicle vs ASA-treated (11.1 mmol/L) WT mice were
analyzed for SOX2 mRNA expression. In separate experiment,
B16-MSCV cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO or FGF-1
(10 ng/ml) and after 24 hour, total RNA was analyzed for
SOX2 expression. The fluorescence was detected using a
Step One plus Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The quantification of each PCR product was
performed by 2−ΔΔCt method [17, 59–60].

In-Vivo tumor growth studies

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To determine effects of tumor versus stromal PAF-R
expression in ASA-mediated modulation of experimental
melanoma tumor growth, we first performed pilot studies
with n=5 syngeneic WT mice and following 0.5 × 106
B16-MSCV melanoma cells implantation, these mice were
treated with varying doses of ASA (2.8, 5.6 and 11.1 mmol/L
dissolved in drinking water with 0.2% DMSO) to determine
the dose of ASA that inhibits melanoma tumor growth. Mice
were monitored for tumor development and mice weights
were recorded. Finally, we choose 11.1 mmol/L (dissolved
in water with 0.2% DMSO). Next, 0.5 × 106 murine B16PAFR and B16-MSCV cells were implanted subcutaneously
(SQ) into the shaved right hind flanks of WT and PAFR-/mice (day 0) followed by treatment with or without ASA
during the entire period of the experiment. Control mice
received 0.2% DMSO in water as vehicle. Tumor growth
(major and minor circumferences) in these studies was
monitored and measured every 3 days with digital calipers
(Mitutoyo Corp., Aurora, IL), and tumor volume was
calculated (major circumference × minor circumference2/2).
Additionally, mice and tumor weights were recorded by
digital balance.
