Abstract
Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) that enable activation by antiandrogens occur in hormone-refractory prostate
cancer, suggesting that mutant ARs are selected by treatment.
To validate this hypothesis, we compared AR variants in metastases obtained by rapid autopsy of patients treated with
flutamide or bicalutamide, or by excision of lymph node metastases from hormone-naı̈ve patients. AR mutations occurred
at low levels in all specimens, reflecting genetic heterogeneity
of prostate cancer. Base changes recurring in multiple samples or multiple times per sample were considered putative
selected mutations. Of 26 recurring missense mutations, most
in the NH2-terminal domain (NTD) occurred in multiple
tumors, whereas those in the ligand binding domain (LBD)
were case specific. Hormone-naı̈ve tumors had few recurring mutations and none in the LBD. Several AR variants
were assessed for mechanisms that might underlie treatment
resistance. Selection was evident for the promiscuous receptor
AR-V716M, which dominated three metastases from one
flutamide-treated patient. For the inactive cytoplasmically
restricted splice variant AR23, coexpression with AR enhanced
ligand response, supporting a decoy function. A novel NTD
mutation, W435L, in a motif involved in intramolecular interaction influenced promoter-selective, cell-dependent transactivation. AR-E255K, mutated in a domain that interacts
with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, led to increased protein stability
and nuclear localization in the absence of ligand. Thus,
treatment with antiandrogens selects for gain-of-function
AR mutations with altered stability, promoter preference,
or ligand specificity. These processes reveal multiple targets
for effective therapies regardless of AR mutation. [Cancer Res
2009;69(10):4434–42]

Introduction
Tumors arise through the accumulation of somatic mutations
that allow uncontrolled growth and lead to general genomic
instability and acquisition of random mutations (1). This creates a
heterogeneous tumor population that is able to adapt to changes
in environment (2). In the case of prostate cancer, this ‘‘mutator

phenotype’’ may contribute to the relatively rapid development of
treatment resistance.
Because prostate cancer is initially androgen responsive,
standard treatment uses combined androgen blockade: reduction
of androgen synthesis and direct antagonism of the androgen
receptor (AR) with antiandrogens (3). Therapy ultimately fails,
indicated by increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and
recurrent tumor growth (4). Despite castrate androgen levels, AR is
still highly expressed and active in hormone-refractory tumors,
implying a switch to alternative mechanisms of activation (5).
Among mechanisms proposed for AR activity at no or low hormone
levels are AR gene amplification, increased coactivator expression,
activation by growth factors, and selection of somatic AR mutations (6). Therapy-specific selection of AR mutants may underlie
antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome in which tumors regress on
treatment cessation (7, 8), and may explain why tumors resistant
to one antagonist may respond favorably to another (9, 10).
Many AR mutations have been reported in prostate cancer, but
their prevalence and influence on disease progression are unclear
due to few comprehensive sequencing studies, variable treatment
regimens, and limited access to high-quality samples. Many
previous studies focused on the ligand binding domain (LBD),
although recent examinations of the entire AR coding region have
identified NH2-terminal domain (NTD) mutations as well (11–13).
Apart from the T878A mutation that is reported in about one third
of hormone-refractory tumors (10, 14), most mutations seem to be
rare (15).
Studies in mouse prostate cancer models, wherein treatment is
experimentally controlled, add compelling evidence for treatment
selection. In the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate
(TRAMP) model, intact versus castrate hormonal status selects
for AR mutations in different domains (16). Our lab recently
identified mutations in tumors from TRAMP mice expressing
a ‘‘humanized’’ AR (17). Mutations in AR were frequent but at
low levels, generally comprising 10% or less of the tumor RNA.
Examination of recurring alterations identified ones distinct between flutamide- and bicalutamide-treated mice, as well as clustered mutations shared among groups. Characterization of select
mutants revealed altered AR function, including differential activation of androgen-responsive promoters.
Here we extend this analysis to a set of high-quality patient samples with detailed treatment records from the University of Michigan
Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Prostate
Cancer. To determine whether antiandrogens impose treatmentspecific selection pressure, AR mutations were compared from flutamide-treated, bicalutamide-treated, and hormone-naı̈ve patients.
Functional analysis of known as well as novel variants provides insight
into alternative mechanisms of antiandrogen resistance.

Treatment-Selected AR Mutations in Prostate Cancer

Materials and Methods
Patient samples. RNAs from metastases of patients treated with
bicalutamide or flutamide were obtained from the University of Michigan
Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Prostate Cancer
rapid autopsy program; tissue was procured as described (18). Biopsies of
treatment-naı̈ve lymph node metastases were obtained from the University
Hospital in Ulm, Germany as part of the UM SPORE-Ulm Cooperative
Collaborative Clinical Case Procurement Program (19).
Mutation identification. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.5 Ag
oligo (dT) in a 20-AL reaction. Two reverse transcription (RT) reactions were
done per sample to control for error. The entire AR coding region was PCR
amplified in five fragments using the primers listed below. Twenty-fivemicroliter reactions contained 2.5 units of Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen), 2 Buffer and 1 GC enhancer (supplied by the manufacturer), 1.5 mmol/L MgSO4, 0.3 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates,
0.5 Amol/L each primer, and 1 to 3 AL of RT reaction. Primer pairs are as
follows. AR1 forward, position 1074: 5¶-CGGGGTAAGGGAAGTAGGTG-3¶;
AR1 reverse, position 1732: 5¶-CTGCCTTCGGATACTGCTTC-3¶; AR2 forward, position 1689: 5¶-CAACTCCTTCAGCAACAG-3¶; AR2 reverse, position
2448: 5¶-CAGTTGTATGGACCGTGT-3¶; AR3 forward, position 2412: 5¶-TCATCCTGGCACACTCTCTTCACA-3¶; AR3 reverse, position 2693: 5¶-GGGGCCCATTTCGCTTTTGACACA-3¶; AR4 forward, position 2639: 5¶-GGTGAGCAGAGTGCCCTATC-3¶; AR4 reverse, position 3399: 5¶-TCCTGGAGTTGACATTGGTG-3¶; AR5 forward, position 3312: 5¶-GACCAGATGGCTGTCATTCA-3¶; AR5 reverse, position 3982: 5¶-GAAATTCCCCAAGGCACTG-3¶.
Products were processed as described (17). Briefly, products were
visualized on 1% agarose gels; bands were excised and purified with the
QiaexII Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). 3¶-A overhangs were added by
incubation with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) at 70jC for 30 min. Products
were ligated into pGEM-T easy (Promega) and transfected into DH5a
chemically competent bacteria (Invitrogen). DNA from 20 clones per sample
(10 clones per RT reaction) was purified with QIAprep Spin Miniprep
columns (Qiagen) and sequenced by the University of Michigan DNA
Sequencing Core.
Sequence was compared with the human AR (GenBank accession no.
NM_000044) using Sequencher software (version 4.1, Gene Codes), and
mutations checked against the Androgen Receptor Gene Mutations
Database7 (15).
Mutant AR plasmids. Mutations E255K and W435L were introduced
into the pCMV5 hAR expression vector using the QuickChange Site Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the primers below. DMSO was added to
the mutant strand synthesis to prevent Q and G tract contraction. Plasmids
were sequenced to verify the mutation and the original number of Q and G
codons. Mutation primers are as folllows: E255K sense, 5¶-GTGTGGAGGCGTTGAAGCATCTGAGTCCAGGG-3¶; E255K antisense, 5¶-CCCTGGACTCAGATGCTTCAACGCCTCCACAC-3¶; W435L sense, 5¶-CGCTTCCTCATCCTTGCACACTCTCTTCACAGC-3¶; W435L antisense, 5¶-GCTGTGAAGAGAGTGTGCAAGGATGAGGAAGCG-3¶. A mutant with the 69-bp DNA binding
domain insertion was constructed by ligating a HindIII/Tth111I fragment
into pCMV5-hAR; insert and junctions were verified by sequencing. To
introduce W435L into the mammalian two-hybrid plasmid VP16-ARTAD
(20), a BstEII/HindIII fragment of wtAR NTD was substituted with the
analogous pCMV5-AR-W435L fragment.
Transfection assays. CV-1 cells were cultured in DMEM and PC-3 cells
in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Glutamax, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. RWPE cells were grown in complete keratinocyteserum-free medium. Cells were seeded at 5  104 (CV-1) or 1  105 (PC-3
and RWPE) in 12-well plates. Four hours before transfection, medium
was replaced with standard DMEM or RPMI + 2.5% charcoal-stripped
NuSerum + 1% Glutamax. Cells were transfected with Fugene 6 reagent
(Roche) at 3 volumes of Fugene/Ag DNA with 4 ng pCMV5-AR (wt or
mutant), 400 ng luciferase (luc) reporter plasmid, and 100 ng promoterless

renilla (Promega) for normalization. PSA-luc includes the distal PSA
enhancer ( 5323 to 4023) and promoter ( 542 to +12; ref. 21). C¶D9,
HRE3, and HRE2 reporters have been described (22). Nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) expression plasmid and pBVIx-luc (6XNF-nB) reporter were from
G. Nunez (Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI;
ref. 23). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were rinsed in
1 PBS and fed phenol red–free medium + 10% charcoal-stripped Nuserum
+/ hormone. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection into 1 Passive
Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a Veritas Microplate
Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Inc.).
Immunoblotting. CV-1 cells were seeded at 4  105 per 60-mm dish and
fed phenol red–free medium +/ 1 nmol/L R1881, 4 h before transfecting as
above with 100 ng receptor (wtAR or mutant) and 1.9 Ag vector (pCMV5).
Twenty-four hours later, cells were rinsed in cold 1 PBS, harvested in
100 AL radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer + protease inhibitors,
lysed at 4jC for 10 min, and centrifuged at 4jC for 10 min. Protein was
quantified by the Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Twenty micrograms of
protein were run on 5% stacking/8% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with antibody to the
AR NH2 terminus (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500) and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated ECL antirabbit IgG (GE Healthcare; 1:5,000)
for 45 min. Bands were detected with ECL Western blotting reagents (Pierce
Biotechnology).
Cycloheximide and lactacystin treatments. CV-1 cells were transfected
with wtAR or AR-E255K as above. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with PBS
and incubated in medium containing 30 Amol/L cycloheximide (Sigma) +/
1 nmol/L R1881 for times indicated, or treated with 10 Amol/L lactacystin
(Cayman Chemical) for 18 h. At indicated times, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer plus inhibitors as above. Immunoblot bands were quantitated by
densitometry using ImageJ (National Center for Biotechnology Information). AR levels were normalized to h-tubulin and percent protein was
determined relative to amount at time 0 (100%).
Immunocytochemistry. PC-3 cells (4  104) were seeded onto fourchamber slides and transfected with 100 ng receptor in phenol red–free
RPMI + 10% charcoal-stripped Nuserum. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
fed fresh medium +/ 10 nmol/L R1881 and incubated for 24 h. Cells were
rinsed in ice-cold PBS, fixed on ice in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min,
permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min, blocked in 5% heatinactivated goat serum (Invitrogen) in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h, and
then incubated in AR N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500) overnight and
with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1,000) for 1 h. Slides were
mounted with Prolong Gold plus 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were captured using an Olympus BX-51 microscope with an
Olympus DP-70 high-resolution digital camera.

Results
Identification of AR mutations in prostate cancer metastases.
To examine directly whether AR mutations differ between treated
and untreated tumors, whether mutation frequency increases
following antiandrogen treatment, and whether different antiandrogens select for distinct mutations, the AR coding region was
sequenced from prostate cancer metastases collected in the
University of Michigan Rapid Autopsy Program (18). Because
secondary hormone therapy is often used after relapse, only 8 of
30 patients met the criterion of treatment with only one
antiandrogen—4 were treated with flutamide and 4 with bicalutamide (Table 1). AR from three hormone-naı̈ve lymph node
metastases from patients at the University of Ulm Hospital (Ulm,
Germany) was sequenced for comparison (19). RNAs from all
samples were reverse transcribed, and the entire AR coding region
amplified, subcloned, and sequenced; mutations were compared
within and between groups.
Sequencing the equivalent of 20 full-length AR mRNAs per metastasis (10 from two independent RT reactions) identified 280 single

nucleotide changes in 191 codons. The average alteration rate
within the population was 4.1 base changes/10,000 bp, comparable to the rate observed in h/mAR-TRAMP tumors using the same
method (17). For that study, baseline error due to sequence
peculiarities [e.g., variability in CAG (Q) and GGN (G) tracts and
high GC content overall] and methods (e.g., RT and subcloning
error) was established by sequencing Ar RNA from mouse testis.
Testis samples carried 2.2 base changes/10,000 bp, indicating that
about half the differences in tumor samples by this approach are
likely somatic mutations. A similar error level was reported in
comparable studies using RT and PCR amplification (24).
Of the total base alterations, 160 were missense, with 10% in the
polyQ and G-tracts, and 69 were silent mutations, 30% of which
were in the polymorphic G-tract. A breakdown of mutation types
per treatment group is available (Supplementary Table). There
were no significant differences between treatment groups in total
number or types of mutations. Mutations in the NTD (amino acids
1–535) were overrepresented relative to AR length, accounting
for 73% of mutations from all groups (excluding the polyamino acid
tracts). Most mutations were present in one or two clones per
sample, or 5% to 10% of the RNA population, similar to mutation
frequencies in mouse (16, 17). Because it is difficult to distinguish
between true mutations that occur in a single clone and methodologic errors, analysis was restricted to mutations that occurred
in multiple clones.
Treatment-specific patterns of recurring mutations. Mutations that provide a growth advantage are likely to be more
common within the tumor. Mutations occurred more than once
in 36 codons, either in multiple cases (24 codons; Fig. 1A) or in
multiple clones within a tumor (17 codons; Fig. 1B). Recurring
missense mutations include those that alter a codon to different
residues (away from wild type, e.g., L194F/R) or to the same new
residue (e.g., Q58L). Both types could be functionally significant.
All but two missense mutations identified in multiple cases were
located in the NTD, with few specific to a single group—half
occurred only with antiandrogen treatment and half were shared

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

by treated and untreated patients (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the 13
missense and 2 nonsense mutations present in multiple clones per
tumor were case specific and not restricted by domain (Fig. 1B).
Ten silent mutations recurred, six of which were in the G-tract.
A silent change at E213 is a known polymorphism (25), occurring
in all 20 clones of three samples, but also in four and seven clones
from two other samples.
Differences between treatments were most apparent for
mutations that occurred multiple times per tumor (Fig. 1B). Only
two of these mutations occurred in hormone-naı̈ve samples,
whereas flutamide- and bicalutamide-treated tumors carried eight
and seven mutations, respectively. Three antiandrogen-treated
tumors carried most of the recurring mutations (Table 1). Length of
treatment did not affect frequency of mutations, although power
was limited by sample size.
All recurring mutations in the LBD were from antiandrogentreated tumors, suggesting selection for altered conformation of,
or ligand contacts within, the binding pocket. Half of the
antiandrogen-treated tumors carried at least one recurring LBD
mutation, but none overlapped between the flutamide and
bicalutamide groups, indicating distinct selection conferred by
each drug. The flutamide-treated group had three missense
mutations in the LBD: V716M, L798P, and L874P (Fig. 1B). V716M,
discussed below, creates a promiscuous receptor (26). L798P is a
novel mutation within an E3 ubiquitin ligase interacting area (27).
L874P, also novel, lies near codons H875 and T878, which, when
mutated, allow flutamide to activate AR (28, 29).
Multiple metastases from one patient express only ARV716M. The mutation V716M was present in all 20 clones
sequenced from the lung metastasis of flutamide-treated patient
28 (Table 1). To rule out a germ-line mutation, 281 bp around
V716M were amplified and sequenced from the patient’s normal
kidney genomic DNA. Only the wild-type G occurred at position
3261, indicating that the mutation was somatic (Fig. 1C). Additional examination of cDNA and/or genomic DNA from two other
metastases from this patient yielded only mutant sequence with no

detectable wild type (Fig. 1C), indicating that a clonal population
carrying AR-V716M accounted for all three metastases. No other
mutations recurred in this sample. Given that AR-V716M is
activated by a wide array of ligands (26), its predominance in this
patient’s cancer supports its role in treatment resistance.
The splice variant AR23 was only in antiandrogen-treated
cases. A variant generated by the use of a cryptic splice site in
intron 2 was identified in one or more clones in five of eight tumors
from treated patients, but in none of the hormone-naı̈ve tumors.
Alternative splicing inserted 69 bp of intron 2 in frame to add 23
amino acids between the zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain.
This variant, AR23, was previously found in androgen insensitivity

syndrome due to a mutation upstream of exon 3 that altered
splicing (30). Recently, AR23 was identified in a prostate metastasis
from a bicalutamide-treated patient (31). AR23 was engineered into
an expression plasmid, and its activity assayed after transfection.
As also shown by Jagla and colleagues (31), AR23 was incapable of
nuclear localization on hormone addition but rather formed
cytoplasmic speckles (Fig. 2A) and failed to activate androgenresponsive reporters (Fig. 2B). Previously, AR23 was shown to
increase endogenous AR-T878A activity when overexpressed in
LNCaP cells (31). In Fig. 2B, AR23 also increased wtAR activation
(2-fold greater PSA-luc activity) following coexpression in PC-3
cells. Moreover, in the presence of AR23, wtAR was less inhibited by

localization and enhances wild-type AR (wtAR ) activity.
A, punctate cytoplasmic localization of AR23. AR23
transfected into PC-3 cells shows diffuse cytoplasmic
localization without ligand (top ) like wtAR (not shown), but
forms cytoplasmic puncta with 10 nmol/L R1881 (middle )
unlike wtAR nuclear localization (bottom ). AR detection

B, transactivation of wtAR, AR23, or 1:1 wtAR/AR23

agonist or antagonist treatment (HOF, hydroxyflutamide;
Bic, bicalutamide), and luciferase activity was assayed.
Average normalized values of three independent trials are

12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA ). WtAR
reduced activation to 20% of vector alone with 10 nmol/L

hydroxyflutamide or bicalutamide. This effect was not specific to
AR because transactivation by NF-nB and activator protein-1 also
increased with AR23 (31), and AR23 reduced glucocorticoid
receptor inhibition by RU-486, which antagonizes both receptors
(Supplementary Data). AR23 could not transrepress activated
NF-nB–induced transcription, unlike wtAR (Fig. 2C; ref. 32). Thus,
cytoplasmic activity of AR23 broadly, but not universally, influences
nuclear activities.
Novel mutations in the AR NTD in conserved functional
motifs. The largely unstructured NTD contains two activation
functions (AF1 and AF5) that bind coactivators and are critical for
AR activity (33). The NTD directs intramolecular amino-carboxy
(N-C) interactions via FxxLF and WxxLF motifs that stabilize
ligand-bound AR. In this study, 14 of 19 mutations in the NTD fell
into four regions: the polymorphic Q-tract, the COOH-terminus of
Hsp70-Interacting Protein (CHIP) interaction domain, the WxxLF
motif, and the end of AF5 involved in coactivator interactions
(Fig. 1; ref. 34). Mutations in the CHIP interacting domain were
previously discovered in TRAMP: AR-E231G causes cancer as a
prostate-specific transgene, highlighting the oncogenic potential of
AR (16, 35). The novel mutations W435L and E255K were
engineered into expression vectors for functional characterization.
W435L alters an AR N-C interaction motif. The mutation
W435L was identified in one clone each of two antiandrogentreated patients. Its position within the WxxLF motif suggests that
this mutation may influence N-C interactions. To determine the
effect on transactivation, AR-W435L was cotransfected into CV-1
fibroblasts, immortalized prostate RWPE cells, and prostate cancer PC-3 cells along with varied reporters. Androgen-responsive

or direct repeats that are weaker but AR selective (e.g., HRE2;
ref. 36). Natural promoters often contain both element types as well
as binding sites for other factors. AR-W435L increased transactivation preferentially for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)
in CV-1 cells and PSA in RWPE, likely due to greater efficacy on ARselective elements (Fig. 3). This promoter-specific effect was also
cell type dependent because there was minimal effect in PC-3 cells.
To probe W435L action further, we used a mammalian two-hybrid
system in which the ability of the AR NTD ( fused to the VP16
activation domain) to bind the LBD ( fused to the Gal4 DNA
binding domain) is assessed by luciferase activity driven by Gal4
DNA elements (20). When W435L was introduced into the NTDVP16 fusion, activity was more than 50% greater than for wtAR,
confirming that this mutation enhances N-C interaction (Fig. 3D).
Mutations in the conserved CHIP interacting domain. Two
mutations from treated patients, A253V and E255K, lie adjacent to
the most highly conserved region of the NTD where interaction
with CHIP, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, promotes AR degradation (37).
To determine whether E255K enhances AR stability, CV-1 cells
transfected with wtAR or AR-E255K were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis; cells were harvested at indicated
times thereafter to detect protein degradation. R1881 greatly
stabilized both mutant and wild-type AR proteins as expected
(Fig. 4A). However, AR-E255K half-life was extended compared with
wtAR, particularly in the absence of ligand (12.5 versus 5.2 hours,
respectively). E255K migrated slower than wtAR, which may be due
to differential protein modification.

Treatment-Selected AR Mutations in Prostate Cancer

To explore whether E255K stabilization was influenced by the
20S proteasome, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor
lactacystin. Without ligand, proteasome inhibition increased wtAR
steady-state levels as expected (38). However, AR-E255K levels were
unaffected, indicating that proteasome activity has little effect on
this mutant (Fig. 4B).
Because both the proteasome and chaperones are implicated in
nuclear transit, AR-E255K localization was examined by immunocytochemistry. Without R1881, wtAR was mostly cytoplasmic as
expected, but AR-E255K showed significant nuclear localization
(Fig. 4C). Tallying the localization in cells showed skewing of ARE255K to the nucleus without ligand compared with wtAR (Fig. 4C).
AR-E255K induced reporter gene expression similarly to wtAR in
CV-1 and PC-3 cells with no increased activity without androgen or
with added coactivators ARA70 and SRC-1 (data not shown).
However, in RWPE cells, AR-E255K increased transactivation of
PSA-luc 2.5-fold relative to wtAR (Fig. 4D). This may be due to host
cofactor differences, as well as somewhat greater activity on
canonical elements like HRE3. Thus, AR-E255K exhibited increased

stability, substantial nuclear localization without ligand, and cell
type–dependent differential promoter activation.

Discussion
This study reveals a low level of mutation throughout the AR
coding region in metastases from antiandrogen-treated as well as
hormone-naı̈ve patients, providing evidence for genetic heterogeneity and a ‘‘mutator phenotype’’ in prostate cancer (1). Very few
mutations in the hormone-naı̈ve samples occur in multiple clones
per case, suggesting that most provide little growth advantage and
may be random ‘‘passenger’’ mutations. However, antiandrogen
treatment leads to more mutations in greater abundance,
suggesting that treatment selects for a subset of AR mutations
within this diverse population.
Examination of recurring mutations within and between samples indicates specific codons that may provide a selective advantage during cancer progression. Remarkably, mutations recurring
in multiple samples are mostly in the NTD and are shared across

Figure 3. Promoter and cell context dependence of AR-W435L. Transactivation of AR-W435L was assessed in CV-1 (A), RWPE (B), and PC-3 (C ) cells, revealing
promoter-specific increases most pronounced in RWPE and absent in PC-3 cells. Cells were transfected with 4 ng of wtAR or AR-W435L and 400 ng of the
indicated reporters. PSA was activated poorly in CV-1 cells and thus MMTV was tested instead. After 24 h, cells were fed with phenol red–free medium +/
1 nmol/L R1881. Average values normalized to renilla for three trials are represented as percent induced wtAR activity. D, AR-W435L increased N-C interaction

Gal4-luc, and 100 ng renilla. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fed +/ R1881 for 24 h. Activity was compared with induced wtAR NTD + LBD (100%).

Figure 4. AR-E255K has increased stability and ligand-independent nuclear localization. A, AR degradation following cycloheximide treatment. wtAR or AR-E255K
plasmid (100 ng) was transfected into CV-1 cells, which were treated after 24 h with 30 Amol/L cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at times indicated, and 20 Ag
of total protein were electrophoresed (left ). AR bands from scanned immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ, and values normalized to the amount of protein
at time 0 (100%). The log10 of the percentage was plotted versus time for wtAR and AR-E255K without hormone (right ). Half-life was calculated as log10 of 50%
based on the linear regression. AR-E255K shows a longer half-life (t 1/2 = 12.5 h) than wtAR (t 1/2 = 5.2 h). Full gels are in Supplementary Data. B, proteasome
inhibition with lactacystin increased unliganded wtAR, but not AR-E255K, levels. CV-1 cells were transfected as above, treated after 24 h with 10 Amol/L lactacystin,
harvested 18 h later, and immunoblotted. C, following transfection into PC-3 cells, wtAR was largely cytoplasmic without hormone (top ) whereas most cells with
AR-E255K showed more nuclear staining (bottom ). Color images and composite are in Supplementary Data. AR was detected as for Fig. 2. Percentages of cells
with cytoplasmic to nuclear AR fluorescence are graphed as follows: C, exclusively cytoplasmic; C > N, cytoplasmic greater than nuclear; C = N, equal cytoplasmic

treatment groups. This emphasizes the broad function of the NTD
in growth factor and coactivator interactions and in receptor
stability, and suggests that some AR variants provide general
growth advantages regardless of treatment. In contrast, all missense mutations in the LBD are case specific and are only found in
antiandrogen-treated patients, evidencing their likely selection by
treatment. Further, the lack of overlap in mutations between bicalutamide and flutamide treatments suggests that these antagonists
select for distinct variants.
Although the patient samples are fewer than the 40 tumors we
examined from h/mAR-TRAMP mice (17) and are metastases rather
than primary tumors, similarities emerge. Overall mutation frequency is comparable, although there are more mutations present in
multiple clones per human sample, likely reflecting the clonal nature
of metastases and extended time with disease. Q58L and DQ86 are
common in both mice and men regardless of treatment. In both
species, there are fewer recurring mutations in hormone-naı̈ve
tumors, substantiating selection pressure of therapy.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

Mutations also occur in similar domains in human and mouse
ARs, particularly following flutamide treatment. Mutations in
flutamide-treated tumors occur in two regions important for ligand
specificity: the highly conserved signature sequence (i.e., mARW719C, hAR-V716M) and the distal region where some mutations
allow promiscuous ligand recognition (i.e., mAR-P893S, hAR-L874P;
refs. 17, 39). Whereas this study did not find the common T878A
variant, L874P may act similarly (40), perhaps displacing the T878
residue that extends into the ligand pocket, thus accommodating
the larger hydroxyflutamide.
The capacity of LBD mutations to affect disease progression is
highlighted by the dominance of AR-V716M in three metastases
examined from one flutamide-treated patient. We infer that V716M
arose either within the primary tumor or early in metastatic invasion. This sample had no other recurring mutations, suggesting
that an effective variant reduces the selective value of other
mutations. Interestingly, this patient survived much longer than the
other cases. In eight patients, this was the only case of fixation of

Treatment-Selected AR Mutations in Prostate Cancer

an AR mutation, indicating that this is a relatively rare event; most
cancers may instead have subsets of cells with different mutations,
each providing a similar growth advantage.
Only one LBD mutation recurred following bicalutamide
treatment, perhaps because a single residue change is unlikely to
be sufficient to accommodate this bulkier antagonist in a manner
compatible with agonism. Only mutation of W742 has been shown
to allow bicalutamide to activate AR (41). The single recurring LBD
mutation in a bicalutamide-treated patient, R761K, is at a residue
commonly mutated in castrated h/mAR-TRAMP mice (17),
implying the mechanism is not partial agonism.
Not only mutants but also splice variants may be subject to
treatment selection, as shown recently for variant ARs that lack
LBDs in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (42). The AR23 splice
variant found in antiandrogen-treated patients here may be present in cells along with wtAR, but has effects on other nuclear
factors as well. Although itself inactive, AR23 increases wtAR
transactivation when coexpressed. Cytoplasmic aggregates of
liganded AR23 may sequester antiandrogens or interacting
partners or participate in intracellular signaling via intact NTD
and LBD domains, allowing wtAR to function (31). Alternatively,
AR23 in an unfolded state, suggested by aggregation, may
compromise the cell chaperone system, allowing AR and other
proteins to evade degradation for generally enhanced activity. This
decoy function may be valuable against treatment because AR23
is absent in untreated patients.
The W435L mutation increases transactivation of AR-selective
promoters in some cells. This contrasts with the h/mAR-TRAMP
mutant AR-R753Q, which functions on canonical but not selective
elements (17). Selection for differential promoter usage may change
over the course of disease and incorporate multiple mechanisms.
The effect of W435L might also vary with disease stage or cell type.
Recently, the WxxLF motif has been implicated in ligandindependent AR activation (43). Mutation to LxxLF could weaken
normal competition with the FxxLF motif, thus increasing liganddependent activity while increasing ligand-independent function
via greater mimicry of coactivator interactions. Alternatively,
W435L may affect AR stability via altered exposure of FQNLF,
which helps target AR to the proteasome (44). Because steady-state
levels of AR-W435L seem to be unaffected, it is more likely that
W435L affects transcription and coactivator interactions, either
directly or via influence on FxxLF function, as supported by greater
N-C interaction shown in the mammalian two-hybrid assay.

Mutation of the highly conserved CHIP interaction domain in
both murine and human tumors underscores the importance of
this region and illustrates the utility of mouse models for obtaining
clinically relevant insights. E255K stabilizes AR and increases
nuclear localization in the absence of hormone. This may have a
similar effect to AR amplification, seen often in metastatic prostate
cancer (45). Increased AR levels may enhance response to low
ligand concentrations, increase ligand-independent activation, or
promote agonism of antiandrogens (46). Although transactivation
by AR-E255K is similar to wild type in transfection, overexpression
may mask relevant differences. The analogous mAR-E231G shows
modest differences in transfection but is oncogenic as a prostatespecific transgene (35).
In summary, this study identified a greater number of recurring
mutations in metastases from treated versus untreated patients.
Furthermore, the variety of mutations identified indicates that
antagonist treatment does not select for a few common mutations
but instead selects for numerous rare mutations, many of which
may affect AR function and might be overlooked using bulk
sequencing methods. Combining the novel mutations identified
here with those from previous studies highlights AR domains
within which mutations share a similar phenotype (47). These
mutations affect diverse AR processes beyond transcriptional
potency, including cell localization, stability, and promoter
selectivity. Better understanding of these processes may present
new targets for therapies that obviate the ability of AR to evade
antiandrogen treatment.
