ABSTRACT
The EGFR/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1/GSK-3 pathway plays prominent roles in
malignant transformation, prevention of apoptosis, drug resistance and metastasis.
The expression of this pathway is frequently altered in breast cancer due to mutations
at or aberrant expression of: HER2, ERalpha, BRCA1, BRCA2, EGFR1, PIK3CA, PTEN,
TP53, RB as well as other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In some breast
cancer cases, mutations at certain components of this pathway (e.g., PIK3CA) are
associated with a better prognosis than breast cancers lacking these mutations. The
expression of this pathway and upstream HER2 has been associated with breast cancer
initiating cells (CICs) and in some cases resistance to treatment. The anti-diabetes
drug metformin can suppress the growth of breast CICs and herceptin-resistant
HER2+ cells. This review will discuss the importance of the EGFR/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC1/GSK-3 pathway primarily in breast cancer but will also include relevant
examples from other cancer types. The targeting of this pathway will be discussed
as well as clinical trials with novel small molecule inhibitors. The targeting of the
hormone receptor, HER2 and EGFR1 in breast cancer will be reviewed in association
with suppression of the EGFR/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1/GSK-3 pathway.

INTRODUCTION

in individuals with certain cancer-associated BRCA1/
BRCA2 alleles is 60-80% for breast cancer and 2040% for ovarian cancer. These individuals also develop
cancer at an earlier age. In addition, other genes involved
in DNA repair and signaling are implicated in breast
cancer including: Fanconi anemia (FA) genes (FANCD2,
FANCA and FANCC), mismatch repair genes (MutL
homolog 1 [MLH1], MutS protein homolog 2 [MSH2],
PMS1 protein homolog 1 [PMS1], mutS homolog 6
[MSH6]), mismatch repair endonuclease PMS2 [PMS2]
and DNA repair genes (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated
[ATM], Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related [ATR]
and serine/threonine-protein kinases Chk/2 (CHK1/2),
and the tumor suppressor genes (TP53, Serine/threonine
kinase 11 [STK11] also known as liver kinase B1[LKB1],
phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN]) and protein
phosphatase 6 (PP6) [32-44].
In an important study with triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) patients, the frequency of BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutations and survival was examined [45].
DNA was isolated from tumor samples as well as normal
tissues from 77 TNBC patients and the genetic sequence
of the BRCA1/2 exons and flanking regions determined.
19.5% of the TNBC patients had BRCA mutations,
15.6% were mutant at BRCA1, and 3.9% were mutant
at BRCA2. It turns out that the patients with BRCA
mutations were younger than the patients with WT
BRCA genes. In this study which followed the patients
for up to 214 months, there were 42.9% recurrences and
45.5% deaths. Interestingly, the five-year recurrencefree survival estimates were associated with the genetic
status of the BRCA genes. As the five-year recurrence-free
survival rates were 51.7% for patients with WT BRCA
genes whereas they were 86.2% for patients with BRCA
mutations.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also mutated in patients
with ovarian cancer [46]. BRCA1/2 mutations are present
in approximately 11 to 15% of unselected ovarian cancer
patients. BRCA1 mutations were positively associated with
TP53 mutations. The presence of BRCA1/2 mutations after
platinum chemotherapy were associated with improved
progression free survival.

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
death in women. This disease is diagnosed in nearly 1.4
million women and is responsible for more than 450,000
death every year [1]. According to the WHO release,
there has been a 20% increase in the number of reported
worldwide breast cancer patients which resulted in
522,000 deaths since 2008. According to the US National
Cancer Institute, approximately 232,000 occur resulting in
about 40,000 deaths in the USA each year. Breast cancer is
not gender specific [2,3]. The frequency of breast cancer
in men is approximately 100-fold lower than in women as
approximately 2,200 males will be diagnosed with breast
cancer each year in the USA.

Breast Cancer Genetics.
A prominent risk factor for the onset of breast
cancer is age; however factors linked to lifestyle and diet
also play important roles in breast cancer. Mutations at
or deregulation of certain genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, HER2,
PIK3CA) and others play important roles in breast cancer
[4-18]. Mutations or aberrant or deregulated expression
of TP53, MDM2 and RB also can play roles in the
therapeutic responses of breast cancer [19-26]. Restoration
of functional TP53 activity can increase the sensitivity of
some TP53 mutant cells to certain anticancer drugs [27].

BRCA Genes and Other Genes Involved in DNA
Repair Are Implicated in Breast Cancer.
Breast cancer occurrence is attributed to both
genetic and environmental factors. Some breast cancers
are due to hereditary mutations, namely those involving
BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 encodes breast cancer type
1 susceptibility protein which is involved in DNA repair
and is considered a caretaker gene. The BRCA1 protein
interacts with RNA polymerase II and also with histone
deacetylase complexes [28]. BRCA1 plays key roles in
transcription, repair of breaks in double stranded DNA as
well as ubiquitination. The BRCA1 protein also combines
with other proteins which detect DNA damage and other
cell signals and forms a multi-subunit protein complex
known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance
complex (BASC) [29]. Components of this complex may
be mutated in certain cancers.
BRCA2 is also involved in the repair of DNA
double strand breaks [30]. BRCA2 binds single stranded
DNA. BRAC2 interacts with the RAD51 recombinase
to stimulate strand invasion which is a critical step in
homologous recombination. For RAD51 to bind the DNA
double-strand breaks, a complex of BRCA1/partner and
localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2)/BRCA2 is required [31].
The risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer

Hereditary and Sporadic Breast and Ovarian
Cancer.
Many spontaneous breast cancers are associated
with environmental exposures to carcinogens [4761]. These include: air pollution [52], exposure to
polychlorinated biphenyl congeners [53]. Pesticides
[54,58], electromagnetic radiation [55], cadmium
and nickel [56], radiation from medical imaging [59],
acrylamide [61] and other toxins.
Deregulation of BRCA1 expression has been
implicated in sporadic breast cancer. The trinucleotide4604

Oncotarget

BRCA1 promoter region were examined in 96 sporadic
invasive breast carcinomas and 43 sporadic ovarian
carcinomas. Methylation of the BRCA promoter region
was detected in 11% and 5% of the breast and ovarian
carcinomas respectively. Methylation of the BRCA1
promoter was linked with lack of ER and PR expression
in these tumors [65].

repeat-containing 9 (TNRC9) gene has been shown to
downregulate BRCA1 expression which results in breast
cancer aggressiveness. TNRC9 is amplified in certain
breast cancer patients and is associated with a poor
prognosis [62]. This group also determined that ectopic
expression of TNRC9 affected breast cancer cell survival.
TNRC9 and BRCA1 protein expression were inversely
correlated in large data sets of breast and ovarian cancer
samples. Interesting this group determined that TNRC9
bound to both the BRCA1 promoter and the cAMPresponsive element-binding protein (CREB) complex.
CREB is a regulator of BRCA1 transcription. Finally
TNRC9 expression suppressed BRCA1 expression by
altering the methylation status of the BRCA1 promoter
region.
BRCA mutations have also been detected in familial
and sporadic ovarian cancer patients. Germline mutations
in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are present in approximately 18%
of hereditary ovarian cancers. These mutations confer
an estimated risk from 15 to 50% in the ovarian cancer
patients [63].
In this study, the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations
in 106 familial Greek ovarian cancer patients who had a
strong family history of ovarian cancer or metachronous
breast cancer. Metachronous breast cancer refers to a
breast cancer patient which has two different breast
cancers which occur at two different times, the two cancers
can occur in the same breast. In addition, the prevalence of
BRCA1 mutations were examined in 592 sporadic Greek
ovarian cancer patients. In Greece, it had been previously
determined that there were 6 types of BRCA1 mutations
that accounted for 63% of all the mutations in the BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes. Deleterious BRCA1 mutations were
observed in 40.6% of familial ovarian cancer cases and
4.6% of sporadic ovarian cases. This study determined
that 71.2% of the BRCA1 carriers presented a high-grade
serous phenotype. These studies document the importance
of identifying BRCA mutations in breast and/or ovarian
cancer families. The authors have stated that all serous
ovarian cancer patients should consider genetic testing.
Hereditary breast cancer often results from
disruption of the normal functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.
In contrast BRCA1/BRCA2 are not necessarily mutated in
sporadic breast cancer, but there may be mutations in TP53
and epigenetic alterations which change the expression
of other genes. These changes result in breast cancer
cells which may be wild WT at BRCA1 and BRCA2 but
have defects in DNA repair. In addition certain sporadic
breast cancers may have hypermethylation of the BRCA1,
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
other genes which prevents or lowers their expression.
These changes may results in the breast cancer cells
having a mutant BRCA phenotype which is referred to as
“BRCAness”. These breast cancers arise at early age and
are aggressive [64].
In one study, the frequencies of methylation in the

Alterations of Genes Involved in DNA Repair in
Breast Cancer.
Sporadic breast cancers accounts for approximately
70% of breast cancers, while familiar breast cancers
account for the remaining 30% which are due to the
present of mutations in breast cancer families (familiar
breast cancers) [66]. Familial breast cancer families have
a higher incidence of breast cancers. There exist different
susceptibility genes which are high-, moderate-, and lowpenetrance susceptibility genes. High-penetrance genes
include: BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN and TP53, which in many
cases are responsible at least in part for the familiar breast
cancer. Other genes have been associated with moderate
penetrance and risk. These include genes involved in DNA
repair, such as CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 (FANCJ), PALB2
(FANCN) and RAD51C (FANCO). In addition, genes
involved in low penetrance and risk are being identified.
The presence of mutations at these different types of breast
cancer susceptibility genes may be examined in breast
cancer screening in the future.
The genetic structures of the TP53, BRCA1, ATM,
and PIK3CA genes were examined in 145 Bulgarian
patients with sporadic breast cancer. The expression of
HER2 was examined by immunohistochemistry and
chromogenic hybridization in situ (CISH) [67]. In this
study, mutations were observed: at TP53 in 22.07% of
the patients, at BRCA1 in 0.69% of the patients, at ATM
in 7.59% of the patients, and in 31.25% of the patients
at PIK3CA. Overexpression of HER2 was observed in
21.21% of the patients. Mutations at TP53 were associated
with both tumor size and grade of malignancy. Mutations
at ATM were associated with grade of malignancy.
Mutations at PIK3CA were associated with PR+ tumors.
HER2 overexpression was correlated with the age of
the patient when diagnosed with breast cancer, tumor
size and ER+. This important study documented that
TP53 mutations were an indicator for poorer outcome.
Importantly, in this study the presence of two genetic
mutations did not correlate with either a more aggressive
carcinoma or a poorer overall survival.
Chk2 is an important kinase which is activated in
response to DNA damage. Chk2 is involved both in TP53
and cell-cycle pathways. In some Li-Fraumeni syndrome
families, which have germline mutations at TP53,
mutations at CHK2 have also be observed. The presence
of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the CHK2 gene was
4605

examined in 139 breast cancer tumors [68]. 139 breast
tumors were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at
chromosome 22q (where the CHK2 gene is located), using
seven microsatellite markers, LOH was detected in 53% of
the breast tumors. Further studies examined the mutational
status of the CHK2 gene and a germ line variant (T59K) in
the first coding exon was detected. Upon screening 1172
cancer patients with different types of cancer for the T59K
sequence variant, it was detected in four breast cancer
patients. This study concluded that CHK2 mutations were
rare in breast cancer but the CHK2 gene product may
perform a tumor suppressor function.

were treated with chemotherapy regmins without an
anthracycline, that had the A2A2 genotype of the PIN3
(+16 bp) polymorphism, had a poorer overall survival than
other genotypes. Although some controversity exists on
use of anthracyclines in breast cancer patients, those with
the A2A2 genotype of PIN3 (+16bp) polymorphism may
benefit. These important studies document the importance
of genetics in personalized medicine.

Effects of c-Myc Overexpression in BRCA1Deficient Breast Cancer Patients.

Methylation of the promoter region of the ER and
other genes has been associated with their decreased
expression. The methylation status of the ER-alpha
promoter region was examined in 138 sporadic breast
cancers. The ER-alpha promoter region was observed to be
methylated in 60.1% (83/138) tumors, including 57 of 69
of the tumors which did not express ER-alpha. This study
determined that the probability of ER-alpha promoter
methylation was increased in those cases that were ERalpha- and PR- [72].
In a study of 100 sporadic primary breast cancers
of which 51 were ER-alpha- and 49 ER-alpha+, ER
methylation was observed in 98% of ER- and 65% of ER+
tumor samples. ER- promoter region methylation was also
associated with lack of PR expression and double receptor
negative expression status of the breast cancer specimens
[73].
The methylation of the ER-beta promoter region
was examined in 178 sporadic breast cancer patients.
ER-beta promoter methylation was observed in 44.9%
of breast tumor samples. In contrast ER-beta promoter
hypermethylation was detected in only 14.3% of patients
with benign breast hyperplasia. 58% of the ER-betatumors exhibited ER-beta promoter region methylation
whereas 36.7% of the ER-beta+-positive cases exhibited
methylation at the ER-beta promoter region. As the
levels of ER-beta promoter methylation increased- the
levels of ER-beta protein detected decreased in the tumor
samples. A strong correlation between ER-alpha promoter
methylation and ER-beta promoter methylation was
observed [74].

Epigenetic Modification of the ER genes in Breast
Cancer.

Elevated c-Myc expression leads to a poor prognosis
in sporadic breast cancer patients that are BRCA1-deficient
[69]. In this important study, the presence of BRCA1 gene
expression was examined in 374 sporadic breast cancer
patients. BRCA1 expression was lacking in 60.4% of the
breast cancer patients. Patients that lost BRCA1 expression
often had more advanced breast cancer and were tumor
node metastasis stage III positive, lymph node positive and
overexpressed c-Myc. The presence of hypermethylation
of the BRCA1 promoter region was examined. BRCA1
promoter hypermethylation was observed in 16.4% of
the breast cancer patients examined and was associated
with BRCA1-, ER- , c-Myc overexpression, and the
triple-negative phenotype. Thus loss of functional BRCA1
expression combined with increased expression of c-Myc
was associated with a poor prognosis.

Alteration of TP53 in Breast Cancer.
Dysregulation of the TP53 gene also occurs in
sporadic breast cancer [70]. The genetic structure of the
TP53 gene was examined in 136 unselected sporadic
breast cancer patients’ tumors. Approximately 40% of the
tumor samples had TP53 mutations. Moreover, this group
postulated that these mutations were due to exposure of the
breast cancer patients to environmental mutagens based on
the frequency of G-T transversions and the incidence of
guanosine mutations on the non-transcribed DNA strand
of the TP53 gene.
Polymorphisms of the TP53 gene have been
observed to have prognostic and predictive values in cancer
therapy. The presence of two TP53 gene polymorphisms,
Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16 bp) was observed in ninety-four
women with sporadic breast cancer who were followed
for a mean of 67.9 months after therapy [71]. This study
determined that the different genotypes of the Arg72Pro
and PIN3 (+16 bp) polymorphisms had no significant
impact on survival in the sporadic breast cancer patients.
However, this study observed that the patients which

Expression of EGFR Family Members in Breast
Cancer Patients.
The EGFR family consists of four members. For
the sake clarity in this review, we will refer to them as
EGFR1 (a.k.a., EGFR, HER1, c-erbB1), HER2 (a.k.a.,
EGFR2, c-erbB2), EGFR3 (a.k.a., c-erbB3, HER3) and
EGFR4 (a.k.a., c-erbB4, HER4). The expression of the
EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3 and EGFR4 were examined by
immunohistochemistry in 220 breast cancer carcinomas
[75]. Increased expression of EGFR1 was detected in
4606

Oncotarget

16.4% of the tumors, increased expression of HER2 was
observed in 22.8% of the tumors, increased expression of
EGFR3 was detected in 17.5% of the tumors, and increased
expression of EGFR4 was observed in 11.9% of tumors.
Breast cancer patients with tumors that overexpressed
EGFR1, HER2 or EGFR3 had reduced survival. In
contrast, those breast cancer patients whose tumors
displayed elevated levels EGFR4 had better survival than
the breast cancer patient that expressed EGFR1, HER2
or EGFR3. Thus overexpression of EGFR1, HER2 and
EGFR3 was association with a poor prognosis in breast
cancer patients. In contrast, overexpression of EGFR4
is associated with a good prognosis. In addition, this
group investigated the association of ER expression with
the different EGFR molecules. Expression of EGFR1,
HER2 and EGFR3 was associated with ER negativity in
the breast cancer patients. Moreover those breast cancer
patients that were ER+ and also EGFR1+, HER2+ or
EGFR3+ had poorer survival than those breast cancer
patients which were either ER+ and HER2+ or EGFR4+.
Additional studies were performed by the same
group on the proliferative potential of the different types
of EGFR-expressing cells [76]. These important studies
suggest that EGFR1, HER2 and EGFR3 are linked with
tumor proliferation, while EGFR4 did not appear to drive
proliferation but may even play protective roles.
In another study, the expression of the EGFR1 and
EGFR3 proteins were examined in 104 primary breast
carcinomas comprising nine comedo ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS), 91 invasive ductal carcinomas and four
invasive lobular carcinoma by histochemistry. Increased
expression of EGFR3 was observed in 67% of comedo
DCIS, 52% of invasive ductal carcinomas, 71% of
carcinomas containing both the in situ and invasive lesions
and 25% of invasive lobular carcinomas [77]. 59% of ERtumors, 63% of lymph node+ tumors and 63% of HER2
tumors were positive for EGFR3 expression. 67% of
EGFR1+, 67% of HER2+ (67%), 75% TP53+ and 60% of
cathepsin-D+ DCIS were positive for EGFR3 expression.
The expression of EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3 and
EGFR4 was examined in 100 breast cancer patients [78].
By using immunohistochemistry techniques, 36% of the
breast cancer samples were positive for EGFR1, 27%, of
the breast cancer samples were positive of HER2, 26%
of the breast cancer samples were positive for EGFR3
and 82% of the breast cancer samples were positive for
EGFR4. The expression of these genes was also examined
by RT-PCR and the similar results were observed. An
association between decreased disease-free survival and
expression of HER2 was observed. Co-expression of
EGFR1 and HER2 was associated with a worse prognosis.
In contrast, expression of EGFR4 was associated with a
better outcome. EGFR4 expression appeared to antagonize
the effects on HER2 on clinical outcome in the breast
cancer patients which expressed both.
The link between ER-alpha and EGFR4 expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was examined in 103 breast cancer samples by both
immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR [79]. In 25% of the
breast cancer samples ER-alpha were not expressed. In
addition, approximately 25% of them did not express
EGFR4. About one-half of the ER-alpha- tumors did
not express EGFR4 at both mRNA and protein levels.
The luminal breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D
cells expressed both ER-alpha and EGFR4. While the
basal breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 and the HER2overexpressing SK-BR-3 line expressed neither. These
results have suggested roles for EGFR4 in ER-alpha
mediated signal transduction in breast cancer.
The expression patterns of EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3
and EGFR4 were examined by real-time RT-PCR in
365 unselected primary breast cancers [80]. EGFR1 and
HER2 were negatively associated with ER+ and PR+
breast cancers. In contrast, EGFR3 and EGFR4 were
positively associated with ER+ and PR+ breast cancers. In
a subsequent study with the ER-alpha+ breast cancer cell
line MCF-7, beta-estradiol down regulated the expression
of all four EGFR family member receptors as determined
by RT-PCR. In contrast, the ER antagonist 4-hydroxy
tamoxifen (4HT) inhibited the downregulation induced by
beta-estradiol [81].

Gatekeeper Mutations in HER2.
The T798M mutation in HER2 is considered a
gatekeeper mutation as it affects the ability of small
molecule inhibitors such as lapatinib to bind the ATPbinding pocket and the mutation confers resistance to
the inhibitor [82]. In studies by a different research
group which were aimed at determining the mechanism
of resistance of breast cancer cells containing the HER2
T798M mutation to lapatinib, it was shown that the cells
overexpressed EGFR ligands [83]. In BT474 and MCF10A
breast cancer cells transfected with the construct encoding
HER2-T798M mutation, elevated HER2 kinase activity
was detected and lapatinib did not block phosphorylation
of HER2, EGFR3 or downstream Akt and ERK1/2.
Increased levels of EGFR2 associated with PI3Kp85 were
detected in the transfected cells and the BT474/HER2T798M cells were also resistant to Herceptin. However
these cells were sensitive to the pan-phosphoinositol-3kinase (PI3K) inhibitors BKM120 and XL147 but not the
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1/2 (MEK1/2)
inhibitor CI-1040. The BT474/HER2-T798M transfected
cells expressed elevated levels of the EGFR ligands EGF,
TGF-alpha, amphiregulin (AR), and heparin binding EGF
(HB-EGF). Thus targeting breast cancers with both HER2
inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors may be an appropriate
technique to treat those breast cancer patients with HER2T798M mutations [84]. Other growth factors also bind the
EGFR family of receptors including: EGF, schwannomaderived growth factor (SDGF), vaccinia growth factor
(VGF), Neu differentiation factor (NDF) or neuregulins,

Cancer.

and heregulin. A diagram of EGFR family members is
presented in Figure 1.

Roles of Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Sensitivity
to Herceptin.

HER2 is amplified in 20-25% of breast cancers.
However, the roles of mutations/amplifications of other
EGFR family members are not so clear. Mutations and
amplifications of EGFR1 have been detected in breast
cancer [86, 87]. In a study consisting of 70 TNBC
patient samples, mutations in the kinase domain were
detected in 11% of the samples. This study amplified the
region spanning exons 18 to 21 of the EGFR1 gene. The
investigators detected deletions in exon 19, which encodes
part of the kinase domain. However, the authors indicated
that these mutations appeared to be independent of the
expression levels of the EGFR1 protein that were detected
by immunohistochemistry. A diagram illustrating some of
the effects of mutations/amplifications in EGFR1/HER2
and other genes in breast and other cancers on signal
transduction pathways is presented in Figure 2.
In addition, amplification of the EGFR1 gene
has been detected in certain breast cancers [88]. The
EGFR1 gene was amplified in approximately 6% of the
breast cancer patients they examined (n =175) and the
samples displayed increased EGFR1 expression. They
also examined patient samples which had amplified the
EGFR1 gene for hot-spot mutations in the EGFR1 gene.
No mutations were detected in exons 19 and 21.
The presence of EGFR1 or HER2 gene amplification
or overexpression was investigated in a series of
metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBC) [89]. MBC are
basal like tumors that account for less than 1% of all
invasive mammary carcinomas. Nineteen of the 25 (76%)
MBC examined overexpressed EGFR1. EGFR1 gene
amplifications were detected in 37% of the tumors which
overexpressed EGFR1. In contrast, only one case exhibited
HER2 overexpression but HER2 gene amplification was
not detected in this study of MBC. The authors pointed out
that some of the tumors that overexpressed EGFR1, but
did not have EGFR1 gene amplification, the expression of
EGFR1 could have resulted from activating mutations in
EGFR1, which resulted in its expression.
In a subsequent study by the same group, the
presence of EGFR1 amplification and activating mutations
was examined in 47 MBC [90]. 32% of the samples
exhibited overexpression of EGFR1. Within the subset
that had EGFR overexpression, 34% had EGFR1 gene
amplification. This group examined these MBC samples
for the presence of activating mutations in exons 18, 19,
20, and 21 of the EGFR1 gene. No activating mutations of
EGFR1 in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 were detected in these
MBC patient samples.
The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
(EGFRvIII) is a genetic truncation of the EGFR1 gene. It
encodes a constitutively-active truncated EGFR1 protein
which has been implication in many types of cancers,
(e.g., brain, breast, prostate and others) [91-103].

The splice variant delete16HER2, which results
from exon 16 skipping, has been shown to increase the
transformation frequency of cancer cells. This missplicing results in resistance to Herceptin. In contrast,
retention of intron 8 of the HER2 gene after mRNA
splicing results in the creation of herstatin which inhibits
tumor cell proliferation. Likewise retention of intron 15
during splicing of HER2 results in the p100 protein which
also suppresses tumor cell proliferation [85].

Introduction of a construct encoding EGFRvIII
into MCF-7 breast cancer cells resulted in HER2
phosphorylation, which the authors suggested occurred
through heterodimerization and cross-talk [91]. The MCF7/EGFRvIII transfectants had approximately a 3-fold
increase in colony formation. MCF-7/EGFRvIII were
more tumorigenic that MCF-7 cells in athymic nude
The EGFRvIII protein is detected in various
human cancers, but not in normal tissues. The presence
of EGFRvIII mRNA was examined in primary invasive
breast cancer by utilizing laser capture microdissection
(LCM)/RT-PCR. A high incidence (67.8%) of EGFRvIII
transcripts was observed in pure breast cancer cells
[92]. Furthermore, 57.1% of the infiltrating breast
carcinomas expressed both EGFR1 WT and EGFRvIII
mRNA in the same tumor. In contrast, no detectable
EGFRvIII mRNA was seen in samples of normal
breast tissue. These expression results were further
confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Thus
there was co-expression of EGFRvIII and EGFR WT
in some human invasive breast cancer tissue but not in
normal breast samples. It must be pointed out that other
studies consisting of 55 breast cancer cell lines and 170
primary breast cancer did not observe similar results and
the authors concluded that expression of EGFRvIII is
extremely rare in breast cancer [93]. However, in a study
by a different research group, the expression of EGFRvIII
mRNA in women with breast cancer was examined by
an RT-nested PCR. EGFRvIII mRNA was detected in
the peripheral blood of 30% of 33 low risk, early stage
patients, in 56% of 18 patients selected for neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, in 63.6% of 11 patients with disseminated
disease but not in any of 40 control women [94].
Interesting in the low risk, early stage patients, EGFRvIII
expression was associated with ER- or HER2+. In another
study of 225 breast cancer patients, the expression of
EGFR1, phosphorylated EGFR1, and EGFRvIII, was
examined by immunohistochemistry and the patient
outcomes were also followed [95]. 48% of the patients
displayed EGFR1, 54% of the patients were positive for
phospho-EGFR, and 4% of the patients were positive for
EGFRvIII. EGFR1 expression correlated with negative
hormone receptor status, worse relapse-free survival and
overall survival than those patients with did not express
detectable EGFR1 [95]. Interestingly there did not appear
to be any association between expression of phosphoEGFR or EGFRvIII expression with clinical outcome.
This study indicated that prognostic value of EGFR1
expression was most important in the HER2+ and the ER-/
PR- subgroups.
EGFRvIII expression may down regulate PR
expression in certain luminal B tumors [96]. These tumors
are ER+ but are characterized as having an aggressive
behavior which is 4HT resistant. This subset of breast
cancers displays increased EGFR1, HER2 and downstream
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway activation [96,97].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EGFRvIII interacts with HER2 [98] and chemokine
(C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) [99,100] to activate
signaling pathways important in migration, invasion and
tumorigenesis. These interactions between EGFRvIII and
HER2 and CXCR4 may be prolonged in comparison to
interactions between EGFR1 and HER2 and CXCR4 as it
is more difficult to down regulate the constitutive nature of
EGFRvIII. CXCR4 is highly expressed in breast cancers
and implicated in metastasis [101] and cancer initiating
cells (CICs) [102].
Recently EGFRvIII has been implicated in primary
breast cancers and breast CICs. Its expression has been
associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and
downstream beta-catenin target gene expression and
the expression of genes associated with self-renewal.
Its expression has been linked with increased in vitro
mammosphere formation and tumor formation [103].
HER2 normally has to heterodimerize with another
EGFR family member for activity. However, if the HER2
gene is amplified, HER2 activity is induced and the
abnormal breast tumor growth is dependent on HER2
activity for growth [104]. An activating mutation has been
detected in HER2+ lung cancer patients in the germline
from a Japanese cancer patient with a familiar history of
lung cancer as well as sporadic cancer patients [105]. The
mutation occurred in the transmembrane region and may
be responsible for increased stability and dimerization.
This mutation activated downstream HER2 signaling
molecules including Akt and p38MAPK.
Somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the
HER2 gene, which result in its activation have been
detected in lung cancer patients [106]. In a study involving
non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), HER2 mutations
were detected in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC cancer
specimens examined but were absent in other types of
cancers. The HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions
in exon 20 corresponding to a similar region as in the
EGFR gene where insertions were detected in NSCLC
patients. Interestingly the HER2 mutations were more
frequent in the lung cancer patients that never smoked.
HER2 mutations were detected more frequently in patients
of Oriental ethnicity than other ethnicities. The mutations
were also more frequently detected in females.
Recently mutations in HER2 have been detected
in breast cancer patient samples which lack HER2
gene amplification. Thirteen HER2 mutations were
characterized from twenty-five patient samples which had
HER2 mutations but lacked HER2 gene amplification.
7 mutations were activating and resulted from point
mutations and in-frame deletions. Some mutations
(L755S) resulted in lapatinib resistance; however this was
not an activating mutation. All of the cells containing the
HER2 mutations were sensitive to the irreversible HER2
kinase inhibitor, neratinib [107].
Loss of HER2 activity also results in loss of
phosphorylated EGFR3. It has been shown that HER2
4609

Oncotarget

can dimerize with EGFR3 to drive breast cancer
proliferation [104]. Loss of EGFR3 activity in HER2+
breast cancer cells inhibited their growth. This growth
inhibition mediated by loss of HER2 or EGFR3 and could
be overcome by introduction of a construct encoding
activated Akt. Importantly this group demonstrated that
a key function of EGFR3 was to couple the response of
HER2 to the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC pathway.
Less is known about the roles of EGFR3 and EGFR4
in breast cancer [108]. EGFR3 is naturally kinase-inactive.
However it interacts with the EGFR family members
and serves to transduce signals to the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway. Since EGFR3 is kinase-inactive, it
will be more difficult to isolate inhibitors specific to it.
However, it is still important and it can serve in pathways
responsible for drug resistance [109].
The functions of EGFR4 in breast and other
cancers have been investigated and recently summarized
[110]. Similar to the EGFR1 gene, EGFR4 encodes a
protein contains an extracellular ligand-binding domain,
a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, an intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain, and carboxyl-terminal tyrosine
residues [110,111]. These carboxyl-terminal tyrosine
residues are phosphorylated after ligand binding and
allows coupling of the receptor with other signaling
molecules [111]. Ligand binding to EGFR4 stimulates
either homodimerization or heterodimerization of EGFR4
with another EGFR family member. Activation of EGFR4
signaling results in cleavage and release of the EGFR4
cytoplasmic domain from the membrane, which then may
traffic to the nucleus and mitochondria to exert additional
biological effects [110,112,113].
The roles of EGFR4 in cancer are complex. In some
cancers (larynx, pancreatic and prostate) EGFR4 may
function as a tumor suppressor [110,114-116]. EGFR4
expression in breast, cervical and ovarian cancers is
associated with a favorable prognosis [110, 113,117,118].
The EGFR4 Q646C mutant results in an EGFR4 protein
which undergoes ligand-independent homodimerization
and tyrosine phosphorylation which interestingly
suppresses colony formation of breast, pancreatic and
prostate cell lines [110, 119-121]. Introduction of the
constitutively active EGFR4 I658Q mutant into breast,
ovarian and prostate cell lines induces apoptosis [122].
However, in some cell types and biological
situations EGFR4 has oncogenic activities [120].
EGFR4 is overexpressed in certain cancers including
ependymomas and medulloblastomas [111,116,123].
Overexpression of EGFR4 in lung carcinomas results
in increased proliferation [116.123]. Furthermore,
overexpression of HER2, EGFR4, and the EGFR4 ligand
NRG1-beta in medulloblastoma results in increased
metastasis [124]. Likewise over-expression of EGFR4
in conjunction with EGFR1 and HER2 results in breast
cancers correlates with poor prognosis [125]. In contrast
overexpression of EGFR4 by itself results in a more
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

favorable outcome.
Silencing endogenous EGFR4 expression in
ER+ MCF7 and T47D breast tumor cell lines reduces
anchorage-independent proliferation stimulated by an
EGFR4 ligand such as neuregulin-2beta [110, 126].
HER2 tyrosine kinase activity, rather than EGFR4
tyrosine kinase activity was required for neuregulin-2beta
to stimulate cell proliferation [110]. Interesting the sites
of EGFR4 tyrosine phosphorylation, but not the sites of
HER2 phosphorylation, were required for neuregulin2beta to regulate cell proliferation [110]. Thus the roles of
EGFR4 in cancer remain complex and are influenced by
the expression of other EGFR family members.

Neurofibromin 1 and GTPase Activating Proteins
(GAP).
Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor
gene. It encodes a GTPase which normally serves to
regulate Ras signaling. It is mutated in neurofibromatosis
patients. These patients have elevated (constitutive) Ras
activation. The tumor suppressor NF1 has been implicated
in sporadic breast cancer. Recent studies have suggested
that NF1 is a breast cancer driver gene. NF1 is deleted
or mutated in 27.7% of all breast carcinomas [127]. In
a study of inbred Chaos3 mice, investigators noted high
levels of genetic instability which can lead to mammary
tumors. The genomically-characterized mammary
adenocarcinomas from these mice displayed deletions of
certain genes, and the NF1 gene was deleted in the vast
majority of the mouse mammary adenocarcinomas. These
mammary adenocarcinomas exhibited constitutive Ras
hyperactivation and sensitivity to Ras pathway inhibitors.
Also alternative mRNA splicing events can give
rise to different NF1 isoforms. NF1 and Ras expression
were examined in 22 sporadic breast cancers, 18 benign
lesions and 6 normal breast tissues by tissue microarrays.
NF1 and CELF3-6 RNA expression was examined by
RT-PCR in the breast samples. NF1 and Ras expression
displayed no difference in expression when examined by
immunohistochemistry assays. In contrast, NF1 isoforms
were determined to shift from the type II mRNA isoform
in normal breast in normal breast cancer to the type I
mRNA isoform in breast carcinoma. The authors did not
detect a shift in CELF mRNA cofactor expression that was
related to the shift in NF1 mRNA isoforms. The authors
suggest that there is a NF1 isoform shift in expression
from type II to type I which could be important in the
development and progression of sporadic breast cancer
[128].
NF1 normally serves to regulate Ras and thus is
implicated in the regulation of both the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTORC1 and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. Successful
targeting of Ras may improve the therapy of patients
with NF1 mutations. Alternatively, these patients may
4610

Oncotarget

be sensitive to combined treatment with MEK and PI3K
pathway inhibitors.
Genes that serve to regulate the Ras gene may be
tumor suppressors as when they are mutated the Ras
pathway is turned on. The RasGAP2 gene (RASAL2) is one
such gene, it is a tumor and metastasis suppressor which
is mutated or suppressed in breast cancer. Inactivation of
RASAL2 was shown to be associated with tumor growth,
progression and metastasis in animal models. In human
RASAL2 loss was associated with metastatic disease and
decreased expression of RASAL2 was associated with the
recurrence of luminal B breast tumors [129].
The methylation state of the Ras association domaincontaining protein 1 (RASSF1A) gene was examined in 36
breast cancer patients in breast cancer tissue as well as their
adjacent normal tissues [130]. RASSF1A may function as a
tumor suppressor gene. Methylation of the RASSF1A gene
was detected in 61.1% of the breast tissues but not in their
normal adjacent tissues. The methylation of the RASSF1A
gene resulted in deceases in mRNA and protein levels of
33.3 and 44.4% respectively. In contrast, the RASSF1A
protein was detected in normal tissues. Methylation of
the RASSF1A gene did not appear to be associated with
clinical parameters, such as age, histological types, TNM
stages and lymph node metastases.

[133]. Gene expression signature analysis has revealed
that Ras pathway dependence can predict the sensitivity to
inhibitors targeting the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTORC1 pathways. The Ras pathway activation
is associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors but
resistance to Akt inhibitors in breast and lung tumors. The
Ras pathway signature is a better indicator of Ras pathway
dependency than mutations at KRAS, as there can be
many genetic mutations which can result in Ras pathway
dependency (e.g., upstream receptors, EGFR1 and others
as well as mutations in BRAF and other downstream
signaling molecules). The Ras pathway signature was
determined to be activated in breast cancers which were
sensitive to MEK inhibitors but resistant to Akt inhibitors.
The Ras pathway signature was shown to be increased
in ER- breast cancers and lung adenocarcinomas. The
Ras pathway signature also predicts resistant to the
EGFR1-targeting agent cetuximab (Erbitux) in metastatic
colorectal cancer [134].
Upon novel global gene expression profiling on
47,293 gene transcripts in 128 invasive breast cancers,
the Ras-like, estrogen-regulated, growth-inhibitor
(RERG) gene was determined to be a key marker of the
luminal BC class and could be used to separate distinct
prognostic subgroups [135]. These observations were
further explored by performing immunohistochemistry
on tissue microarrays containing 1,140 invasive breast
cancers [135]. These results showed that the RERG
gene is one of the highest ranked genes to differentiate
between ER+ luminal and ER- non-luminal cancers.
RERG expression was positively associated with the
following markers of luminal differentiation: ER+, the
cytokeratins (CK7/8, CK18 and CK19) and FOXOA1.
RERG expression was also associated with other markers
of good prognosis namely, small size, lower histologic
grade an d AR, BRCA1, fragile histidine triad protein
(FHIT, Bis(5’-adenosyl)-triphosphatase), and p21Waf-1 and
p27Kip-1 and inversely associated with the proliferation
markers MIB1 (a monoclonal antibody which is directed
to a different epitope on the Ki67 protein than the original
Ki67 antibody) and TP53. Importantly RERG expression
was associated with longer survival.
The Rab-coupling protein RCP (a.k.a RAB11FIP1),
is located at a chromosomal region frequently amplified
in breast cancer. Introduction of constructs encoding RCP
into normal human mammary epithelial cells MCF-10A
cells lead to cells with tumorigenic properties. Likewise
knock-down of RCP in breast cancer cell lines decreased
the tumorigenic properties of the cells. Therefore RCP is a
frequently amplified gene in breast cancer 	 and suggest
roles for the Rab family in carcinogenesis [136].

RAS Gene Family Mutations/Alterations in
Breast Cancer.
In a genetic study examining the mutational status
of the Ras and PI3K pathway genes in 40 breast cancer
cell lines, mutations were detected at approximately
25% in Ras pathway members (KRAS, HRAS, NRAS,
and BRAF) and 54% of PI3K pathway members (PTEN,
PIK3CA). However, unlike the mutational status of these
two families in colo-rectal cancer, this study did not
detect mutation in both pathway family genes in single
cell lines very frequently [131]. In subsequent studies by
the same group with 41 breast cancer cell lines, this group
found 146 mutations among twenty-seven cancer causing
genes, which resulted in an average of 3.6 mutations per
cell line. Mutations in TP53, RB and PI3K pathways
were frequently detected in the breast cancer cell lines.
Importantly these investigators could identify mutational
profiles that were associated with luminal-type and basaltype breast cancer cell lines. The luminal mutational
profile included E-cadherin (CDH1) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4 a.k.a. MEK4) genes
and amplifications of the cyclin D1, (CCND1), HER2 and
mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), while the basal
mutational profile included: BRCA1, RB1, RAS and BRAF
gene mutations and deletions of tumor suppressors p16
(CDKN2A) and p14ARF (CDKN2A a.k.a. INK4A) [132].
Activation of the Ras pathway is often detected in
breast cancer in the absence of mutations of the RAS genes

present may have implications for the selection of PI3Ktargeted therapies in hormone receptor-positive breast
cancer.
In a study which examined the genetic structure of
the PIK3CA gene in 452 breast cancer patients, PIK3CA
mutations were observed in 33.4% of the breast cancer
patients [141]. PIK3CA mutations were more frequently
detected in ERalpha+ and PR+ breast cancers (41.1%),
than in TNBCs (ER-,PR-, HER2-) (12.5%.). Patients
which had PIK3CA mutations had a longer metastasis-free
survival period than the overall population.
The mutational status of the PIK3CA gene was
examined in eighty HER2+ breast cancer patients as
well as clinical outcome of the patients after Herceptin
treatment [142]. The PIK3CA gene was determined to be
mutated in 21.3% of HER2+ breast cancer patients that
had been treated with herceptin for one year. Improved
disease free survival was observed in those patients with
WT PIK3CA as opposed to those patients with mutant
PIK3CA. The PIK3CA gene is also mutated in some
ovarian cancer patients [143].
PI3K-p110 (PIK3CA) protein expression was
examined in 1,394 early stage breast cancer samples.
Elevated PI3K-p110 was associated with the basal-like
breast cancers, HER2+ breast cancer, and triple negative
non-basal breast cancers. In contrast, the luminal class
of breast cancers had reduced levels of PI3K-p110 in
comparison to the other classes. PI3K-p110+ breast
cancer patients had shorter disease free survival. Thus
these studies demonstrated that PI3K-p110 expression is a
biomarker associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer
[144].

The B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus
insertion region-1 (Bmi-1) gene functions in stem cell
maintenance. It is a member of the polycomb group
of transcription repressors. Bmi-1 exerts it effects by
suppression of the p16Ink4A/ARF tumor suppressor.
Increased expression of Bmi-1 is detected in many cancers.
The effects on Bmi-1 overexpression were examined on
MCF-10A cells. While Bmi-1 overexpression by itself did
not result in the oncogenic transformation of MCF-10A
cell, co-expression of activated H-Ras (RasG12) resulted
in the oncogenic transformation of MCF-10A cells. The
Bmi-1/H-Ras transformed cells exhibited properties of
cells that had undergone the epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Bmi-1 inhibited senescence and
allowed the proliferation of cells expressing high levels
of activated H-Ras [137]. Subsequent studies by the same
group have indicated that knock-down of Bmi-1 in breast
cancer cell lines decreased their aggressive nature in vivo
in tumor transplant studies [138].

Mutations in Components of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt
mTOR Pathway in Breast Cancer.
In a study which examined MBC, PIK3CA
mutations were detected in 47.4% of the cancers which
were aggressive and also chemoresistant. In contrast,
PI3KCA mutations were detected in 34.5% of hormone
receptor-positive cancers, 22.7% of 75 HER2-positive
cancers, 8.3% of basal-like cancers and none of claudinlow tumors examined in this study. MBCs and claudin-low
breast cancer subsets displayed enrichment for markers
linked to stem cell function and EMT. It was postulated
that MBCs and claudin-low tumors are enriched with
CICs and may arise from an earlier, more chemoresistant
breast epithelial precursor than either basal-like or luminal
cancers. However in this study, no mutations at PIK3CA
were detected in the claudin-low cancers, so the roles of
PIK3CA mutations in these cancers are not clear [139].
In a study with 547 human breast cancer patient
samples and 41 established cell lines, the mutational
status of PIK3CA, AKT and PTEN were analyzed as well
as the effects of pathway mutations on the sensitivity to
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [140]. PIK3CA mutations were
determined to be more frequent in ER+ (34.5%) and
HER2+ (22.7%) than in basal-like tumors (8.3%). AKT1
(1.4%) and PTEN (2.3%) mutations were determined to
be restricted to ER+ breast cancers. Interestingly cells
with PIK3CA mutations were less sensitive to the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 inhibitor than breast cancer cells
which had loss of PTEN activity. Thus, PI3K pathway
aberrations likely play a distinct role in the pathogenesis
of different breast cancer subtypes. The specific aberration

Interactions between PIK3CA Mutations and
HER2 Amplification in Breast Cancer.
Introduction of genetic constructs containing
PIK3CA mutations E545K and H1047R into MCF-10A
human mammary epithelial cells that also overexpress
HER2 conferred enhanced growth properties to MCF10A/
HER2 cells in comparison to cells which lacked the
introduced mutant PIK3CA gene [145]. Upon introduction
of mutant PIK3CA (H1047) into MCF-10A cells which
overexpress HER2, the expression of EGFR3/EGFR4
ligand heregulin (HRG) was detected. In contrast,
introduction of mutant PIK3CA (E545K) gene into the
MCF-10A cells which overexpressed HER2 did not result
in the expression of HRG. Silencing HRG with siRNA
inhibited the growth of MCF-10A/HER2/PIK3CAH1047R cells but not MCF-10A/HER2/PIK3CA-E545Kexpressing cells. The HRG siRNA synergized with the
HER2 inhibitors herceptin (trastuzumab) and lapatinib.
Treatment of the cells with a PI3K inhibitor (BEZ235)
suppressed HRG and P-AKT levels. When the cells
were cotreated with BEZ235 and lapatinib, a complete
4612

Oncotarget

suppression of growth was observed. These important
result document interactions between HER2 and certain
PIK3CA mutations and point to the possible co-targeting
of HER2 and PI3K in certain breast cancers.
Deregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
pathway by gene mutations has been estimated to occur
in >70% of breast cancers [146]. In ER+ breast cancers,
activation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway
can result in both estrogen-dependent and estrogenindependent ER activity and contribute to estrogenindependence and potentially loss of sensitivity to
hormonal based therapies. Activation of the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTORC1 pathway can also result in resistance to
HER2 inhibitors in HER2+ cells. Inhibition of the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway can overcome resistant
to hormonal and anti-HER2 targeted therapies [146].
Encouraging results have been obtained in breast cancer
clinical trials with combinations of various inhibitors.
These results predict that combinations of HER2, PI3K,
mTORC2 inhibitors and hormonal based therapeutics may
be appropriate for the treatment of certain breast cancer
patients which are resistant to current therapies.
The transforming activity of mutant PI3K has
been linked to its ability to bind phosphorylated YXXM
motifs present in activated receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) or adaptor molecules, potentially in association
with the PI3K-regulatory subunit, p85. EGFR3 is a
potent activator of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
pathway. The requirement for EGFR3 in PI3K-mediated
transformation of mammary epithelium was investigated
[147]. Conditional loss of EGFR3 in mammary epithelium
lead to a delay in PI3K-H1047R-mediated mammary
hyperplasia. However, these studies demonstrated that
tumor latency and PI3K signaling were not perturbed. In
the EGFR3-deficient mammary tumors, the PI3K-H1407R
protein was determined to be associated with several
tyrosyl phosphoproteins. These studies also demonstrated
that inhibition of other EGFR family members with
lapatinib did not inhibit the mutant PI3K-mediated
signaling. However, co-inhibition of PI3K with the PI3Kalpha specific inhibitor BYL719 and EGFR-mediated
signaling with lapatinib was more effective in suppressing
growth than treatment with either the PI3K-alpha
inhibitor or lapatinib alone. Additional studies by this
group determined that co-inhibition of PI3K and EGFR
suppressed growth and PI3K signaling in human breast
cancer cells containing the mutant PIK3CA-H1047R gene.
These studies point to the possibility of co-targeting of
PI3K and EGFR in certain breast cancers.

to herceptin. PTEN was identified as a modulator of
resistance to Herceptin in cell cultures experiments.
Likewise oncogenic PIK3CA mutations would confer
resistance to Herceptin in cell cultures [148]. In a
screening of samples from 55 breast cancer patients,
PIK3CA mutations or low expression of PTEN was
associated with resistance to Herceptin.

Deregulation of PI3K and PTEN in Metastatic
Breast Cancer.
The mutational status of the PIK3CA gene and
expression of PTEN was examined in breast cancer
specimens that differed in the state of malignancy (e.g.,
primary vs. metastatic breast cancer from the same cancer
patient) [149]. The PIK3CA gene was determined to be
mutated in 19 (40%) of primary tumors and 21 (42%) of
metastatic cancers. PTEN expression was examined by
immunohistochemistry and PTEN expression was lost
in 14 (30%) primary tumors and 13 (25%) metastases.
Thus the PI3KCA gene is frequently mutated and PTEN
expression is often lost in breast cancer.

Epigenetic Regulation of Additional and Novel
Genes Associated with Breast Cancer.
Epigenetic profiling has recently resulted in the
identification of genes associated with breast cancer
tumorigenicity that were methylated [150]. This study
identified 264 hypermethylated loci in genomic CpG
islands. Hierarchical clustering in terms of the levels of
methylation at the loci resulted in generation of at least
three distinct groups of breast cancer patients. Namely
the methylation levels were distributed into three
different groups, ER+/PR+ breast cancer patients, time
to tumor relapse and lymph note metastasis. Methylation
of six genes (RECK, SFRP2, UAP1L1, ACADL, ITR,
and UGT3A1) was associated with decreased relapse
free survival. Reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein
with kazal motifs (RECK) is thought to be a metastasissuppressor gene and may interact negatively with matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP9). Secreted frizzled-related
protein 2 (SFRP2) is a soluble modulator of Wnt signaling.
Methylation of this gene has been association with breast
and other cancers [151]. UAP1L1 encodes a UDP-Nacteylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1-like 1 protein.
ACADL is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
family. This is a family of mitochondrial flavoenzymes
involved in fatty acid and branched chain amino-acid
metabolism. The ACADL gene product is associated with
long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase
deficiency. The ITR gene (ITR/GPR180) is a G proteincoupled receptor). The UGT3A1 gene is a member of the
UDP glycosyltransferase 3 family.

breast cancer patients which lack amplification of HER2,
documenting a role for HER2 in the growth of these
normally HER2-negative cancers [181]. These authors
demonstrated that HER2 was expressed in ER+, HER2luminal breast cancers and regulates the self renewal of
the CIC sub-population. HER2 expression was not due
to gene amplification but was determined to result from
receptor activation of NF-kappaB (RANK)-ligand in the
bone microenvironment.

Drug resistance breast cancer cells are enriched
in populations of cells which have characteristics of
cancer stem cells. These cancer cells with stem like
characteristics are referred to cancer initiating cells (CICs)
[152-175]. In the study by Britton and colleagues with
both clinical fine needle aspirates obtained from breast
cancer patients as well as established breast cancer cell
lines, the expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family
G member 2 (ABCG2=BCRP1) was monitored [175].
In the studies with the side populations from MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells, increased ABCG2 was observed in
the side populations as well as elevated resistance to the
chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone. The increase in the
side populations may be due to increased drug transporter
expression in the cells with the CIC phenotype as the
drug transporter would exclude the drugs from the cells.
The presence of the side populations in the fine needle
aspirates was associated with ER-negative breast cancers
and TNBCs which also had elevated ABCG2 protein
expression. Breast CICs can be characterized by increased
expression of CD44 and decreased expression of CD24
(CD44↑/CD24↓) compared to the remaining cancer cells
which are referred to as the bulk cancer cells (BCs). The
CICs and BCs differ in their gene expression patterns
which may have resulted from epigenetic and other
mechanisms [176]. Thus the CICs and BCs will likely
have different signaling pathways activated/suppressed
which will require different therapeutic approaches to
eliminate both populations of cancer cells.

PI3K Pathway in Breast CICs.
The PIK3CA gene may be mutated in some breast
CICs [182]. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC pathway
has been reported to be important in breast CICs. Sidepopulation positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells [MCF-7/
(CIC)] were isolated from parent MCF-7 bulk cancer
[MCF-7/(BC)] [183]. The MCF-7/(CIC) cells displayed
increased drug transporter activity and enhanced colonyformation ability in vitro and greater tumorigenicity in
vivo than the MCF-7/(BC). The expression of critical
pathways were compared between MCF-7/(CIC) and
MCF-7/(BC). The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 and STAT3
pathways were shown to be differentially expressed in the
MCF-7/(CIC) population and responsible in part for their
enhanced survival [183].

Deregulation of Akt in Breast Cancer.
Mutations of Akt are relatively rare in breast
cancer, however, aberrant activation of either upstream
PIK3CA or polymorphism of the PH domain and leucine
rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) gene can
result in Akt expression. In a study which examined
the mutational status and polymorphism of genes in the
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway, DNA was isolated
from fine needle aspirations of 267 stage I-III breast
cancers [184]. In this study, 28 genes were examined for
163 known cancer-related DNA sequence variations by
Sequenom technology. The PI3K pathway was determined
to be frequently altered in breast cancers as at least one
mutation in 38 alleles corresponding to 15 genes in
108 (40%) of the breast cancer samples. The PIK3CA
gene was determined to be the most frequently mutated
(16.1% of all samples), the F-box and WD repeat domain
containing 7, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (FBXW7) gene,
the second (8%), the BRAF gene, the third (3.0%), the
EGFR1 gene, the fourth (2.6%), the AKT1 and CTNNB1
genes (beta-catenin) the fifth and sixth (1.9% each), the
KIT and KRAS genes (1.5% each), and the PDGFRA
gene, the seventh (1.1%). Polymorphism at the PHLPP2
phosphatase which activates Akt was observed in 13.5%
of the patient samples. PIK3CA mutations were observed
more frequently in ER+ cancers compared to TNBC
(19 vs. 8%). Interesting a high frequency of PIK3CA

Involvement of HER2 in Breast CICs.
HER2 is expressed in the CIC population [177,
178]. The expression of HER2 is modulated by the tumor
microenvironment. Targeting of HER2 in these CICs may
be an appropriate therapeutic approach. Interestingly
herceptin suppressed tumor growth of the CIC in mouse
xenograft models but in not established breast tumors
[176].
Initially was thought that herceptin would only be
effective in breast cancer patients which overexpressed
HER2, some clinical studies have shown that herceptin
may target breast cells which did not overexpress HER2
[179]. These results have led to the hypothesis that HER2
is an important molecule expressed on breast CICs and
further studies have suggested that HER2 expression
may be induced by signals in the microenvironment in
breast CICs which lack HER2 gene amplification.The
effectiveness of herceptin is thought to be due to its ability
to target the breast CIC population as well as the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTORC and other signaling pathways [176,
177, 180].
Herceptin may also be effective in the treatment of

progenitor cells both in vitro and in vivo. This increase in
progenitor cells was mediated by increased Akt activation
which resulted in the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta which
in turn led to activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
The increases in progenitor cells could be suppressed by
the Akt inhibitor perifosine [190]. PTEN is also important
in the resistance of breast cancers to herceptin and other
therapeutic approaches [191].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is cytokine which is an
important immune-regulator. IL-6 is also important in
HER2-resistance as it can expand the CIC population
[192-194]. Decreases in PTEN expression has been
implicated in herceptin-resistance. In HER2+ cell lines
generated by knocking down PTEN, which were resistant
to herceptin, the resistance was shown to be due to
activation of an IL-6 inflammatory feed back loop. This
IL-6 inflammatory loop resulted in the expansion of breast
CIC which have an EMT phenotype and secrete 100-fold
more IL-6 than in the parental cells which did not have
PTEN knocked down. The authors of this important study
also determined than treatment with an IL-6R Ab inhibited
this IL-6 regulatory loop and reduced the CIC population
and importantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis
in mouse xenographs. A figure depicting the effects of
PTEN on certain CICs as well as ER-signaling is present
in Figure 3.
The tumor microenvironment is important in CICs.
Interactions between the interleukin-8 receptor (IL-8R)
and HER2 have been determined to be important in
the survival of breast CICs [195]. NF-kappaB has been
shown to be important in breast cancer CIC survival and
HER2-dependent tumorigenesis. NF-kappaB activity can
be regulated by the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway
[193].

mutations (28%) was observed in HER2+ breast tumors.
In TNBC, FBXW7 mutations were significantly more
frequent compared to ER+ tumors (13 vs. 5%). FBXWZ
is a component of ubiquitin ligase (SKP-cullin-F-box)
and may bind cyclin E and target it for ubiquitin-mediated
degradation (Figure 2).
Some investigators have suggested that other
molecules besides Akt are important in breast cancer and
have proposed Akt-independent signaling mechanisms
[185]. This group demonstrated that in some breast tumors
cultured in an anchorage-independent fashion displayed
minimal Akt activation and decreased reliance on Akt for
growth. In contrast, these cells had strong PDK1 activation
and membrane localization and were dependent on the
activated PDK1 substrate serum/glucocorticoid regulated
kinase family, member 3 (SGK3), which is related in
structure to Akt. SGK3 has been shown in additional
studies to be linked with breast cancer and is induced
by estrogen in breast cancer cells and is associated with
ER expression [186]. Like Akt, SGK3 can phosphorylate
GSK-3beta and TSC-2 which results in their inactivation
and activation of mTORC1 and stimulation of protein
translation [187, 188]. Knowledge of the particular kinase
or other type of protein, responsible for the malignant
potential of breast cancer cells could aid therapy by the
use of more effective inhibitors which target the particular
enzyme affected and responsible for the abnormal growth.

Activated Akt as a Marker for Sensitivity to Drug
Therapy.
Phosphorylation (activation) of Akt has been shown
to predict the effectiveness of paclitaxel chemotherapy in
node-positive breast cancer patients [189]. In the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)
B-28 trial, the effectiveness of adding paclitaxel to
doxorubicin (a.k.a Adriamycin) plus cyclophosphamide
(AC) was examined in breast cancer patients (median
follow up 9.1 years). Enhanced effectiveness of adding
paclitaxel to AC was observed in those breast cancer
patients who expressed elevated P-Akt. In contrast,
no enhanced effectiveness of adding paclitaxel to AC
was detected in the breast cancer patients who did not
express activated P-Akt. Thus addition of paclitaxel to
breast cancer patients which are P-Akt- does not appear
to increase the effect of AC therapy, while addition of
paclitaxel to those breast cancer patients which are P-Akt+
does appear to improve therapy.

Targeting PI3K Pathway to Inhibit Breast Cancer
Resistance to Therapy.
Treatment of breast cancer patients with the
aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole has been shown to result
in suppression of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway
[194]. This clinical study examined the expression of PI3K
(p110), P-Akt, and P-mTOR by immunohistochemistry on
breast cancer samples from 113 patients. The patients had
been enrolled in a phase II study of letrozole or letrozole
and cyclphosphamide. Either letrozole or letrozole
plus cyclophosphamide-treated patients displayed a
reduction in PI3K and P-mTOR expression. In contrast,
expression of P-Akt did not change in the letrozoletreated patients whereas it decreased in the letrozole and
cyclophosphamide-treated patients. The reduction of
P-Akt expression was associated with a better response
rate and reduction in Ki67 staining. The reduction in
P-mTOR expression was associated with a longer diseasefree survival. Thus the AI letrozole targets key components

of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway which may be
important in the successful treatment of certain breast
cancers.
This same group developed some letrozoleresistant MCF-7 cells by culturing the cells for prolonged
periods of time in letrozole. The letrozole-resistant cells
displayed elevated expression of key components of the
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. They observed that
suppression of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathways
with PI3K or mTORC1 inhibitors reversed the acquired
letrozole- resistance [195]. A diagram of the effects of
letrozole on ER and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC signaling
and letrozole-resistance is presented in Figure 4.

the combination of ER and PI3K pathway inhibitors.
Inhibition of PTEN activity has been associated with
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, hypersensitivity to
the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin as well as hormonal
based therapies [199,200] Inhibition of PTEN expression
by shRNA resulted in three ERalpha+ breast cancer cell
lines that were able to grow in the absence of hormone.
Furthermore the cells were resistant to 4HT and
fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist that functions
by down regulating the ER. Knock down of PTEN also
increased ERalpha transcriptional activity in MCF-7
cells, but decreased ER protein levels and transcriptional
activity in T47D and MDA-361 cells. Inhibition of PTEN
by shRNA increased basal and ligand-induced activation
of IGF-1R and EGFR-3, documenting the effects that
PTEN can have on the regulation of these upstream
tyrosine kinases. Inhibition of IGF-1R or EGFR-3 restored
hormonal dependency and the effects of hormonal therapy
on the breast cancer cells with PTEN-knocked down.
These studies indicate a possible treatment strategy for
breast cancers which are either PTEN-negative or have
decreased PTEN expression. These results document
the complex interactions between hormonal- and growth
factor-dependent signaling.

Effects of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 Pathway
Activation and ER Expression on Breast Cancer.
PIK3CA mutations in ER+/HER2- luminal
breast cancer actually result in low levels of mTORC1
expression and these breast cancers have some of the
better treatment successes after 4HT therapy [196]. These
PIK3CA mutations are predicted to render these breast
cancers sensitive to targeted therapy. The authors of this
study have devised a PIK3CA gene expression pattern.
This pattern was associated with prognosis in those breast
cancers with PIK3CA mutations that remained ER+/
HER2-, it was not associated with prognosis in breast
cancers which were either HER2+ or ER-.
An inverse relationship between PI3K pathway
activation and ER expression was observed in ER+
breast cancers. When the PI3K pathway was activated,
lower levels of ER were detected, indicating a negative
correlation. Treatment of breast cancer cells with insulin
like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which activated the PI3K
pathway resulted in decreased ER expression. Likewise
treatment of breast cancers with the PI3K inhibitor
BEZ-235 resulted in increased ER activity as well as
ER-regulated gene expression [197]. The PI3K pathway
activity was increased in ER+ tumors and cell lines of the
more aggressive luminal B subtype versus those of the less
aggressive luminal A subtype. The PI3K inhibitor would
increase the effects of 4HT on the more aggressive luminal
B breast cancer, potentially by increasing ER expression
and restoring sensitivity to hormone based therapies.
This study suggests a potential therapeutic approach by
combining PI3K inhibitors and 4HT.
The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway is
also important in the growth of breast cancers which
have become hormone-independent. In four hormoneindependent breast cancer cell lines created after long
term estrogen deprivation, increased phosphorylation of
p70S6K, p85S6K and Akt was observed [198]. Inhibition
of the PI3K pathway in these hormone-independent cells
resulted in apoptosis. These results indicate that some
hormone-independent breast cancers may be sensitive to

Association between PIK3CA Mutations and AR
Expression in Breast Cancer.
An association between AR expression and PIK3CA
mutations was observed in a study which examined AR
and ER expression and PIK3CA mutational status in 347
breast cancer patients [201]. AR expression was higher
in those breast cancers which also expressed ER and PR.
In those samples that expressed AR, mutations in the
PIK3CA kinase domain were more frequently detected
than mutations in the helical domain or those lacking
PIK3CA mutations. High AR expression was linked with
an improved recurrence-free survival in 207 patients with
early-stage ER+/PR+ positive tumors after hormonalbased therapy. Higher AR expression was also associated
with PIK3CA mutations and not with PIK3CA WT or
TNBCs. These studies indicate that AR and PIK3CA (as
well as ER and PR) may be prognostic markers for breast
cancer [201].

Dysregulation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
Pathway in Endometrial Cancer.
Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequent
gynecological malignancies [202]. Many signaling
pathways have been implicated in endometriod cancer
[203-206]. Greater than 90% of endometriod cancers
suffer from some type of mutation in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway. Thus, this pathway is a key therapeutic
target in endometriod cancer [207,208]. Endometrioid

Deregulation of Downstream Components of the
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 Pathway Involved in
the Regulation of mRNA Translation in Breast
Cancer.

endometrial cancers (EEC) frequently have multiple
mutations at PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1 and KRAS. The
effects of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and the
mTORC1 inhibitor temsirolimus were examined on EEC
cells with concurrent PIK3CA and PTEN mutations [209].
ECC with PIK3CA mutations were sensitive to GDC0941, while ECC with PTEN mutations were sensitive to
the mTORC1 blocker. Only 2 of 6 EEC cells with KRAS
mutations were sensitive to MEK inhibitors. The PI3K
p110alpha selective inhibitor A66 was more effective than
the PI3K p110beta inhibitors GSK2636771 and AZD6482
in suppressing the growth of the PTEN-mutant EEC cell
lines.

The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway serves
to regulate the translation of certain mRNAs which are
considered difficult to translate due to their structures.
The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway can regulate the
activity of key components of the translational apparatus
such as eIF4E, eIF4G, 4E-BP1, rpS6, programmed cell
death protein 4 (pdcd4), eEF2 and eEF2K. The expression
of eIF4E, eIF4G, 4E-BP1, p4E-BP1 (T37/46), p4EBP1 (S65), p4E-BP1 (T70), S6, pS6 (S235/236), pS6
(S240/244), pdcd4, eEF2 and eEF2K was examined in
190 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients
[212]. This study followed the course of the breast cancer
patients for 96 months. Elevated eEF2K, rpS6, and
p4E-BP and decreased pdcd4 were associated with poor
prognosis in hormone receptor+ breast cancer. These
molecules may be prognostic markers and therapeutic
targets for certain classes of breast cancer (e.g., hormoneresponsive breast cancers).

Expression of the PI3K-p110 alpha and beta
Subunits in Breast Carcinomas and EEC.
A study was performed on 315 invasive breast
carcinomas to compare the expression of the PI3K-p110
alpha and beta subunits in these breast cancer patients.
Then the expression results were correlated with clinical
outcomes [210]. This immunohistochemistry study
determined that overall the p110 subunits were expressed
in 23.8% of invasive breast carcinomas. PI3K-p110-alpha
was expressed in 11.8% and 15.2% expressed PI3K-p110beta. This study observed that PI3K-p110-alpha expression
was associated with hormone receptor expression but
was not associated with overall survival. PI3K-p110beta expression was linked to HER2 overexpression and
lack of hormone receptor expression. PI3K-p110-beta+
breast cancer patients had lower age of onset, lymph node
involvement and distant metastasis. Those breast cancer
patients that expressed membrane PI3K-p110-beta had
a worse prognosis and overall survival. These important
clinical studies point to the possibility of co-targeting
of HER2 and PI3K-p110-beta in certain breast cancer
patients.
Recently it was determined that the PIK3R1
(p85alpha) and PIK3R2 (p85beta) regulatory subunits are
mutated in EEC [211]. PIK3R1 mutations were reported
to occur at a higher rate in EEC than any other cancer
type. Also this study demonstrated that the PIK3R2 gene
is mutated in EEC, which was previously not thought to be
a cancer gene. Many PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 mutations are
gain of function mutations. Some PIK3R1 mutations bind
and stabilize PTEN. KRAS mutations are also common in
EECs. PI3K pathway mutations can occur in the presence
of WT PTEN and they phenocopy PTEN loss as the
pathway is activated.

Involvement of GSK-3 in Breast Cancer.
Phosphorylation by Akt also inhibits the activity
of many key molecules involved in signaling and
apoptosis. Activated Akt can stimulate carcinogenesis
by inactivating proteins that normally function to limit
cell growth and regulate apoptosis [213]. GSK-3beta
is a down stream target of Akt. Introduction of kinasedead GSK-3beta [GSK-3beta(KD)] into epithelial cells
promoted tumorigenesis of breast and skin tumors [214].
Overexpression of constitutively-active GSK-3beta altered
chemosensitivity, cell cycle arrest and tumorigenicity of
breast cancers [215-218]. Inhibition of GSK-3beta, by
small molecule inhibitors induced epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and invasion in breast cancer [219].
The localization of GSK-3beta was altered in a
study of invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC). A reduction
or loss of cytoplasmic GSK-3beta in was observed in 53%
of IDC examined [220]. Nuclear accumulation of GSK3beta was detected in 35% of the IDC samples examined.
This nuclear accumulation of GSK-3beta was associated
positively with tumor grade [220]. A downstream target of
GSK-3 is p27Kip-1 which is also implicated in breast cancer
[221]. In addition, p70S6K can be regulated by GSK-3
and is involved in breast cancer [222]. Figure 2 depicts
some of the interactions with GSK-3 and these and other
signaling molecules.
GSK-3beta and beta-catenin can regulate
cadherin-11 post-transcriptionally in breast and prostate
cancer cells. Inactivation of GSK-3beta lead to repression
of cadherin-11 mRNA and protein levels [223]. Loss of

cytoplasmic GSK-3beta may promote EMT in breast
cancer [223]. GSK-3 can regulate c-Myb which is
important in EMT in breast cancer [224-227]. A studyl
performed on breast cancer biopsies observed that
inactivation of GSK-3beta was associated with elevated
levels of the prolactin receptor, which is implicated in
tumorigenesis [228]. The breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP) was determined to be downregulated in breast
cancer cells when GSK-3beta was active, documenting
that GSK-3beta can suppress active drug efflux [229].
Suppression of GSK-3beta activity by Akt phosphorylation
enriched for mammary stem cells in both normal and
breast cancer cells through activation of beta-catenin
[230]. Thus at least with regards to mammary epithelial
cells GSK-3beta activity appears to limit proliferation and
suppress the stem-like cell population.
Often GSK-3beta is thought to have roles in tumor
suppression. However, this is not always the case. In
certain cancer types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) GSK-3beta
was shown to participate in pro-inflammatory and antiapoptotic processes by positively regulating NF-kappaB
activity in the nucleus [231-233]. The roles of GSK-3beta
in cancer progression remain controversial and extremely
complex and may depend on the cancer type. The cellular
localization of GSK-3beta is an important factor in
controlling GSK-3beta ability to provide growth-limiting
and survival-promoting activities. Aberrant nuclear
accumulation of GSK-3beta may be important in many
cancers.
The biochemical events leading to loss of functional
GSK-3beta activity may also enrich for a subpopulation of
CICs that demonstrate enhanced motility, clonogenicity,
and drug resistance. However, the production of CICs
may depend on the cancer type as well as stage of
differentiation. Micro RNAs (miRs) also play important
roles in CICs. TNBCs often have a high percentage of
CICs [234]. Different miRs are expressed in TNBC than
other breast cancer. Breast CICs often express high levels
of CD44 and lower levels of CD24 (CD44↑CD24↓) than
the non-CIC population which is referred frequently to as
the bulk cancer. Autophagy is important in the regulation
of the CIC population [235]. GSK-3 plays important
roles in the regulation of autophagy and other age-related
diseases [236]. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 by
small molecule inhibitors or deletion of GSK-3alpha leads
to the prevention of autophagy.
We determined recently that GSK-3beta play
important a role in MCF-7 breast cancer clonogenicity,
drug resistance, and cell signaling [218]. Introduction of
GSK-3beta(KD) into MCF-7 cells resulted in increases
in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent
clonogenicity compared to cells transfected with the GSK3beta(WT) construct. This increase in clonogenicity was
observed when doxorubicin was absent or present. More
colonies were observed in MCF-7/GSK-3beta(KD) cells
than MCF-7/GSK-3beta(WT) or MCF-7/GSK-3beta(A9)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells when the cells were treated with doxorubicin. MCF7/GSK-3beta(A9) cells with constitutive GSK-3beta
kinase activity displayed higher anchorage-dependent,
but not anchorage-independent, clonogenicity than MCF7/GSK-3beta(WT) cells. Anchorage-independent growth
is one measurement of transformed cells. In essence, it
measures the ability of the cells to grow without adherence
to a tissue culture plate surface. Cells which are more
transformed will form more colonies in soft agar than cells
which are either “not”-tranformed or “less”-transformed.
GSK-3beta may play multiple roles by both limiting
proliferation under certain conditions and allowing cell
growth in others. In some cases GSK-3beta functions as a
tumor promoter by phosphorylation of Axin which leads
to beta-catenin stabilization and potentially cancer. In
contrast, other cases GSK-3beta acts as a tumor suppressor
and induces beta-catenin phosphorylation and proteasomal
degradation.
When the cells were plated n doxorubicin, the
anchorage-independent colony forming ability of MCF7/GSK-3beta(KD) cells in doxorubicin was enhanced
five-fold in comparison to MCF-7/GSK-3beta(WT) cells.
Our results indicated that GSK-3beta activity influences
breast cancer proliferation, motility and response to
chemotherapy. Loss of GSK-3beta kinase activity may
confer survival advantages by upregulating factors
involved in cell cycle progression, prevention of apoptosis
and anchorage-independence.
Resistance to doxorubicin and 4HT was increased
in MCF-7/GSK-3beta(KD) cells in comparison to MCF7/GSK-3beta(WT) cells. However, drug resistant MCF-7/
GSK-3beta(KD) cells responded to mTOR inhibition by
treatment with rapamycin. Additionally, a combination
treatment of consisting of a MEK inhibitor and
doxorubicin or 4HT was determined to have a synergistic
effect that eliminated drug resistance in MCF-7/GSK3beta(KD) cells. Targeting signaling molecules involved
with the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 and Raf/MEK/ERK
pathways may be appropriate to overcome resistance to
chemo- and hormonal therapy. Genetic alterations which
result in abnormal GSK-3beta activity should be taken
into considered when designing a course of breast cancer
therapy. Combination drug/inhibitor treatments could
be advantageous by lowering the concentration of the
chemotherapeutic drug and reduce therapy-related side
effects.
There are alternate routes of GSK-3beta activation
that are independent of Akt. To add to the complexity,
GSK-3beta plays roles in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by
being a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex
as well as in the phosphorylation of Axin which results in
the stabilization of Axin. This interaction of GSK-3 with
the Axin protein complex prevents Akt from accessing
and phosphorylating GSK-3beta. There are likely different
cellular pools of GSK-3beta that are under separate
regulation by Wnt and Akt, in which the activation of one
4618

does not affect the other. Simultaneous Akt and GSK-3beta
activity has been observed in pancreatic and colon cancer
cell lines, indicating that increased Akt expression does
not always result with decreased GSK-3beta activity [231].
Since certain pools of GSK-3beta may remain active in
cancer, the precise cellular localization of these pools may
also be an important factor involved in their regulation.
GSK-3beta is thought to be active predominantly in the
cytoplasm, but it can also translocate to the nucleus. The
nuclear activities of GSK-3beta may appear to conflict
with its cytosolic roles. Aberrant nuclear accumulation of
GSK-3beta has been observed in certain cancers [231]. A
nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present in the basic
domain of GSK-3beta [237]. Increased translocation of
GSK-3beta to the nucleus may be involved with cancer
progression.

4E, rpS6 and others. A figure illustrating some of the sites
of targeting these pathways is present in Figure 5. A recent
component which has been shown to be involved in breast
cancer drug resistance is the phosphatase DUSP4 which
removes the phosphate from active ERK1,2. Decreased
expression of DUSP4 is associated with breast cancer
drug resistance and increased expression of active ERK1,2
[241].
Other studies have indicated that increased MAPK
signaling is a predicator of resistance to successful
endocrine therapy of breast cancer patients [242]. This
study included 114 women who were ER-alpha+ that
were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant letrozole or
letrozole plus metronomic cyclophosphamide (frequent
low doses of cyclophosphamide). The expression of
twenty-four proteins involved in apoptosis, cell survival,
hypoxia, angiogenesis and signaling were examined by
immunohistochemistry in pretreatment samples. The
ages, sizes of the tumors, the nodal status of the tumor,
tumor grade, histological type and treatment were also
followed. 81% of the patients had a disease response,
43% achieved a complete clinical response and 19%
did not respond. This study determined that increased
phosphorylated ER-alpha and decreased phosphorylated
ERK1,2 were factors associated with complete response
to therapy. Phosphorylated and activated ER-alpha was
an independent factor for sensitivity to chemoendocrine
therapy. In contrast, HIF-alpha and phosphorylated
ERK1/2 were independent factors associated with
resistance to therapy. These and other results indicating
that targeting ERK (e.g., with MEK inhibitors) may be
effective in reducing the drug resistance of certain breast
cancers.

Involvement of the Wnt Signaling Pathway
in ERalpha+ Breast Cancers with PIK3CA
Mutations.
The PIK3CA gene is mutated in 30-40% of
ERalpha+ breast cancers. Gene expression profiling of
249 ER-alpha+ breast tumors revealed that nineteen genes
were differently expressed in PIK3CA-mutated tumors
in comparison to samples lacking PIK3CA mutations.
Interesting PIK3CA mutations were associated with
over-expression of several genes critical for the Wnt
signaling pathway [WNT5A, transcription factor 7-like
2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box (TCF7L2), msh homeobox
2 (MSX2), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily,
member 11b (TNFRSF11B)], as well as genes important
in the regulation of gene transcription [SEC14-like 2
(SEC14L2), transcription factor AP-2 beta (activating
enhancer binding protein 2 beta) (TFAP2B), nuclear
receptor interacting protein 3 (NRIP3)] and metal ion
binding [cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily Z,
polypeptide 1 (CYP4Z1), cytochrome P450, family 4,
subfamily Z, polypeptide 2, pseudogene (CYP4Z2P),
solute carrier family 40 (iron-regulated transporter),
member 1 (SLC40A1), lactotransferrin (LTF), LIM and
calponin homology domains 1 (LIMCH1) [238]. These
studies suggest that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway
may be an appropriate approach to treat certain ERalpha+
breast cancers containing PIK3CA mutations.

Interactions Between Raf-1 and Aurora Kinase
Signaling in ER+ Breast Cancer.
Recently, it has been shown that there is a Raf-1mediated involvement of Aurora-A kinase signaling which
is important in regulating the balance between EMT
and MET in ER+ breast cancer cells. This interaction
is also important in chemoresistance and regulating the
expression of many genes involved in EMT and MET. The
interactions between Raf-1 and Aurora-1 kinase signaling
altered the metastatic potential of the cells. Constitutive
activation of Raf-1 oncogenic signaling induced HER2 overexpression and resulted in the development of
distant metastases in ERα+ MCF-7/∆Raf-1 breast cancer
xenografts. These distant metastases in xenograft models
were associated with activation of MET as characterized
by reduced expression of EMT-inducer genes (TGFB2,

The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is also important in
breast cancer drug resistance [239,240]. The Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway often interacts with the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway and the two pathways often co regulate
many signaling molecules such as p70S6K, eIF-4B, eIFwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

primary tumors by activating MET [174].
Further studies by this same group demonstrated
that constitutive activation of Raf-1 oncogenic signaling
induced stabilization and accumulation of Aurora-A
mitotic kinase. This promoted EMT and stemness in ER+
MCF-7/∆Raf-1 cells. The EMT transition was associated
by reduced expression of CD24 and ERalpha, while
HER2 and CD44 were upregulated. The upregulation
of the stemness gene SOX2 was linked to acquisition
of multiple stem cell-like properties. Namely the cells
displayed an enhanced ability to form mammospheres
in vitro and self-renewal in vivo. The aberrant Aurora-A
kinase activity induced phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of SMAD5, indicating a novel interplay
between Aurora-A and SMAD5 signaling pathways in
the development of EMT, stemness and ultimately tumor
progression. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of
Aurora-A kinase activity restored the CD24↑ epithelial
phenotype that was coupled with ERalpha expression,
downregulation of HER2, inhibition of EMT and impaired
self-renewal ability and suppression of distant metastases.
These findings demonstrated the importance of Aurora-A
kinase in the activation of EMT pathway responsible for
the development of distant metastases in ERalpha+ breast
cancer cells. This study has translational implications
because it highlighted the mitotic kinase Aurora-A as a
novel, promising therapeutic target to eliminate invasive
breast cancer cells and improve the disease-free and
overall survival of ERalpha+ breast cancer patients
resistant to conventional endocrine therapy [164].
Further studies indicated that cross-talk between
ERalpha+ and Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways is a
key oncogenic axis which is responsible in part for the
development of ER-independent growth of breast cancers
which were initially ERalpha+ and hormone sensitive.
In a metastatic breast cancer xenograft model harboring
constitutive activation of Raf-1, the link between aberrant
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and development of endocrine
resistance through abrogation of the ERα signaling
axis was elucidated. The Aurora-A mitotic kinase was
demonstrated to be important in the development of
endocrine resistance. Activation of SMAD5 nuclear
signaling was detected as well as down-regulation of
ERalpha. These results suggest that the development
of novel molecular therapies targeting the Aurora-A/
SMAD5 oncogenic axis may be beneficial for the selective
eradication of endocrine resistant ERalpha- cancer cells
from the bulk tumor with benefits for breast cancer
patients [243].

(CIN) that affects cancer development and progression.
The relationships between induction of genotoxic
stress, activation of cyclin-A/Cdk2 and Aurora-A
and development of centrosome amplification were
investigated in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines harboring a
dominant negative (DN) p53 mutation (vMCF-7DNp53).
Genotoxic stress was induced in the MCF-7 cells
harboring the DN p53 by treatment with hydroxyurea
(HU) which induced centrosome amplification. Aurora-A
kinase activity was linked with centrosome amplication.
The Aurora-A kinase-induced centrosome amplification
was determined to be mediated by Cdk2 kinase. Molecular
inhibition of Cdk2 activity by SU9516 suppressed
Aurora-A centrosomal localization and consequent
centrosome amplification. MCF-7 cells harboring
constitutively-activated Raf-1 displayed high levels of
endogenous cyclin-A. Targeting of Aurora-A by the Aurora
kinase inhibitor Alisertib reduced cyclin-A expression.
Thus there is a positive feed-back loop between cyclin-A/
Cdk2 and Aurora-A pathways in the development of
centrosome amplification in breast cancer cells which
may be which may provide additional approaches to target
drug resistant breast cancer patients [244]. These studies
document the key interactions between the Raf/MEK/ERK
and Aurora kinase pathways which may be important in
regulating breast cancer progression and serve as targets
for therapeutic intervention.

Breast Cancer Therapy.
The most commonly utilized treatment for breast
cancer is surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy,
hormone therapy or radiation (National Cancer Institute,
2013). Radiation and chemotherapy are effective in killing
or limiting the growth of actively dividing cancer cells
through various mechanisms including the production
of oxygen free radicals, DNA damage, and subsequent
apoptosis [245-251]. Common chemotherapeutic drugs
used to treat breast cancer include the anthracyclines,
taxanes, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and
methotrexate [252]. Doxorubicin, also known as
adriamycin, is in the anthracycline class of antibiotic
chemotherapeutic drugs. These compounds work by
intercalating between adjacent DNA base pairs and
inhibiting topoisomerase II, thereby interfering with DNA,
RNA, and protein synthesis.

The effects of combining chemotherapeutic drugs
have been analyzed by clinical trials.

A phase III, clinical trial with 1491 patients with

cycles. The 10 year follow-up analysis of disease-free
survival, overall survival, and long-term safety in the
clinical trial was reported [253]. In general, breast cancer
patients in ACT treatment group had better disease-free
survival relative to breast cancer patients in the FAC
treatment group. In this study, hormone receptor, and
HER2 status and nodal involvement status did not appear
to change the disease-free survival between the enhanced
survival in ACT treatment group vs. the FAC treatment
group. This study also documented that there were a
significant percentage of patients who had a decrease in
ventricular ejections secondary to anthracycline therapy.
An additional study evaluated the effects of ACT
and FAC treatments on node negative breast cancer
patients over a 5 year observation period. This study
was performed as it was known previously that ACT
is superior to FAC when used as adjuvant therapy in
women with node-positive breast cancer but the effects
of taxanes on breast cancer patients with node cancer
were not known [254]. The breast cancer patients in the
two treatment groups were examined for 77 months. The
disease-free survival was higher in the ACT group (87.8%)
than the FAC group (81.8%). Thus the ACT treatment may
be appropriate for some high risk, lymph node negative
breast cancer patients.

Previously it was thought that hormonal therapy
would only be effective in treatment of breast cancer
cells which express ER-alpha. Triple negative breast and
HER2+ cancers often do not expresses ER-alpha, but some
express ER-beta and may be sensitive to hormonal therapy
[262]. The expression of hormonal receptors (ER, PR) and
HER2 may change with the progression of breast cancer
into metastatic cancer. In addition, the combination of
hormonal based therapy can be enhanced by the addition
of herceptin and mTORC1 blockers in some cases.

Hormonal Therapy Combined with mTORC1
Blockage.
Another common treatment option for breast cancer
consists of a hormonal-based approach [255]. Many early
stage breast cancers overexpress various isoforms of the
ER, making their growth dependent on estrogen. 4HT is a
selective ER modulator. 4HT can block estrogen signaling
by competitively binding the ER and antagonizing its
proliferative effects [256]. Once a breast cancer has
undergone additional molecular changes allowing it to
overcome estrogen-dependence, hormonal therapy is no
longer effective, however, certain inhibitors can reverse
the estrogen-independence (see Figures 3 and 4) [257261].
Exemestane is an AI and prevents conversion of
testosterone into estrogen. The quality of life was observed
to be better in hormone-responsive metastatic breast
cancer patients treated with exemestane and the mTORC1
blocker everolimus than patients treated with exemestane
by itself. In the BOLERO-3 study with herceptinresistant metastatic breast cancer patients, treatment with
everolimus, herceptin and vinorelbine was more effective
than treatment of with herceptin and vinorelbine [262].
Vinorelbine (Navelbine) is anti-mitotic drug [261]. It is
used to treat non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic
breast cancer. Thus suppressing mTORC1 activity could
enhance the effectiveness of exemestane and Herceptin in
different types of breast cancer patients.

Antibody Therapy of Breast Cancer.

Akt/mTOR pathway. This has been proposed to be in part
responsible to the anti-cancer effects of pertuzumab [267].
Initial studies with just pertuzumab did not
reveal impressive results in suppressing cancer growth.
However, in the more recent phase III CLEOPATA trial
have revealed that combination of pertuzumab with
herceptin and docetaxel were promising and significantly
improved prolonged progression-free survival for a
first-line treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer
and importantly no increase in cardio-toxic effects were
observed [268]. Pertuzumab received approval by the FDA
to treat HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients in 2012.
Pertuzumab in combination with herceptin and a taxol has
been approved by the FDA and is being evaluated as a first
line treatment option for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer
patients who have not been previously treated with antiHER2 therapy or chemotherapy [269].
Pertuzumab is being further evaluated in the
following clinical trials: MARIANNE, for advanced
breast cancer, NEOSPHERE, for early breast cancer,
TRYPAHENA, for HER2+ stage II/III breast cancer and
APHINITY for HER2+ nonmetastatic breast cancer [270].

The genetically engineered antibody herceptin
(trastuzumab) is used to treat HER2+ breast cancers.
Combining herceptin with chemotherapy increases
survival and response rates [263]. However a significant
problem with chemotherapy is cardiotoxicity. Herceptin
therapy is also expensive and not always covered by
insurance companies [264]. A diagram depicting the
targeting of HER2 and other signaling molecules and sites
where herceptin-resistance occurs is presented in Figure 6.
Pertuzumab (Perjeta(®) is a newer antibody
developed by Genentech/Roche. Pertuzumab and
herceptin binding to different sites on HER2 and the
combined administration of pertuzumab and herceptin
had synergistic inhibitory effects on HER2+ breast cancers
[265].
Pertuzumab prevents the dimerization of HER2 with
other EGFR family members (EGFR1, EGFR3, EGFR4)
[266]. Pertuzumab prevents the interaction of HER2 with
EGFR3 and subsequent activation of the PI3K/PTEN/

and CICs. Mutations at PIK3CA can alter hormonal dependency. Silencing PI3K with PI3K inhibitors can restore hormonal dependency.
Silencing PTEN can also result in hormonal-independenc, 4HT and fulvestrant resistance. Silencing PTEN can in some cases also lead in
some cases to IL-6 production and an IL-6 inflammatory feed back loop which results in EMT and CIC formation. Silencing of IL-6 with
monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) can prevent this loop and result in the death of the breast CICs.

Trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug
modification of herceptin which is now linked with the
cytotoxic agent mertansine (DM1). It is abbreviated
T-DM1 (trastuzumab-DM1) and also called Kadcyla,
ado-trastuzumab emtansine and PRO132365. Mertansine
inhibits cell growth by binding to tubulin [271]. Herceptin
targets the antibody-drug conjugate to HER+ cells [272].
T-DM1 is more effective than Herceptin in the treatment of
HER+ advanced metastatic breast cancer patients. It was
evaluated in the EMILIA phase III clinical trial. This trial
consisted of 991 cancer patients with unrectable, locally
advanced or metastatic HER+ breast cancer which had
been previously treated with herceptin and taxanes with
breast cancer patients treated with capecitabine (Xeloda)
plus lapatinib (Tykerb). Progression free survival was
enhanced in breast cancer patients treated with T-DM1.
It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
HER2+ advanced metastatic breast cancer patients.
T-DM1 has also been evaluated in other clinical trials
such as MARIANNE, which compares the effectiveness
of the taxanes (docetaxel or paclitaxel) combined with
Herceptin vs T-DM1 by itself vs T-DM1 plus pertuzumab
as a first line therapy for HER2+ breast cancers. Patients

in this study are HER2+, which have either unresectable
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is
also being investigated in the TH3RESA clinical trial
which is evaluating the effectiveness T-DM1 in HER2+
metastatic breast cancer patients that were previously
treated with Herceptin and the EGFR2 kinase inhibitor
lapatinib. T-DM1 is also being evaluated in gastric cancers
in clinical trials. Tables 1-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3
list the various clinical trials in breast cancer which are
listed on the ClinicalTrial.gov website.
EGFR, PI3K, and mTORC1 inhibitors are being
evaluated to treat breast cancer patients. Drug targeting the
ER have been developed and many have been evaluated in
clinical trials [273]. The ER modulators: 4HT, raloxifene,
and lasofoxifene) and AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and
exemestane) have been evaluated extensively [273]. An
important pitfall with these drugs is they were thought to
be only effective in ER+ cancers. Drugs such as herceptin
are more effective on HER2+ breast cancers.
Lapatinib is a small molecule HER2/EGFR1
dual kinase inhibitor that has also shown be effective in
inhibiting the growth of HER2+ breast cancers. TNBCs
do not express either ER or HER2, thus novel therapies

Figure 4: Effects of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 on Aromatase Resistance and Sensitivity to Tamoxifen (4HT). The
aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole prevents the conversion of testosterone (TEST) into estrogen (ER) and hence there is no ERalpha
mediated gene transcription. Letrozole alters the expression of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. PI3K inhibitors will restore
ERalpha mediated gene expression in Letrozole resistant cells and the cells revert to hormonal sensitivity. Likewise PI3K inhibitors will
restore the sensitivity of 4HT-resistant cells to 4HT. Breast cells with mutations at PIK3CA may develop resistance to 4HT and PI3K
inhibitors may restore sensitivity to 4HT.

response to HER2 inhibition by treatment with small
molecule HER2 inhibitors such as lapatinib. Lapatinibresistant HER2+ breast cancer cell lines were generated
by culturing the cells in the presence of lapatinib for
prolonged periods of time. These cells did not express
activated HER2, but they did express the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways which is believed
to be due to activated Src family members. Treatment of
the lapatinib-resistant HER2+ cells with Src inhibitors

Pathways in Breast Cancer Therapy.

growth and restored sensitivity to lapatinib. Treatment of
primary HER2+ tumors with lapatinib actually resulted in
the expression of Src-family kinases as detected by mRNA
analysis. Treatment of HER2+ BT-474 cells with lapatinib
and Src inhibitors was more effective in suppressing the
growth of these cells in xenograft models than treatment
with lapatinib alone. These studies provide a rationale for
the treatment of certain HER2+ cells with the combination
of lapatinib and Src inhibitors as a means to prevent drug
resistance of HER2+ cells [274]. Thus activation of Src
family kinases may be a mechanism by which some
HER2+ cells become resistant to HER2 inhibitors such
as lapatinib.

The possibility of targeting mTORC1 and other
signaling pathways such as Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K, IGF1R to treat breast cancer is also being examined [275]. In
some cases, treatment with rapalogs induces the IGF-1R
or PDGFR pathways which in turn will activate the Raf/
MEK/ERK pathway. This type of approach may also be
appropriate to over come the rapamycin-resistance that
certain breast cancers have developed. There are clinical
trials in progress evaluating the effectiveness of co
targeting mTORC1 and pathways such as IGF-1R, PI3K

and Raf/MEK/ERK (find out how many trials).
Combinations of Herceptin with pertuzumab, or
T-DM1 and mTOR inhibitors added to an aromatase
inhibitor are new therapeutic approaches for the treatment
of HER2+ breast cancers [276].
Inhibition of mTORC1 in combination with
endocrine therapy may be an approach for treatment of
metastatic breast cancer patients which are resistant to
aromatase in inhibitors. Two clinical trials (TAMRAD and
BOLERO-2) have revealed significant effects [277].

While therapies for ER+ and HER+ breast cancer
patients have improved over the years, the treatment
possibilities for TNBC are more limited. A recent review
has summarized the clinical results with more novel
approaches to treat TNBCs which include inhibitors
of enzymes such as PARP and HDAC, kinases such as
Jak2 and Src and receptor kinases as well as biological
processes such as angiogenesis [281].

Combining Herceptin with PI3K, mTORC1
Inhibitors or Chemotherapy to Improve Breast
Cancer Therapy.

Resistance to Therapy.
Rb is a critical protein involved in the regulation
of cell cycle progression and is a tumor suppressor. The
Rb pathway is involved in sensitivity to tamoxifen. Loss
of functional Rb activity is associated with resistance
to tamoxifen [282,284]. Thus oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes often are important in the sensitivity to
therapy [168,285]. A diagram depicting some of the sites
where mutations result in resistance to therapy is presented
in Figure 7. Breast cancers can be inherently drug
resistance or develop an acquired resistance after exposure
to the particular drug [213,252]. Resistance can develop
in patients and breast cancer cells when treated with
anthracycline chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, and epirubicin as well as hormonal based
therapies [199,285,286]. Therefore, cancer cells are
capable of undergoing calculated changes that confer
survival advantages in otherwise nutrient-restricted or
toxic environments [287,288]. Thus novel targets and
approaches to treat breast cancer are being evaluated
[167,289-308]. TGF-beta and Smads are also important
targets in breast cancer [309-312]. The anti-diabetes drug
metformin is showing some successes in treating breast
cancer including Herceptin-resistant breast cancers [313317] A target of metformin is AMPK which is involved in
regulation of components of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 and
GSK-3 pathways. An additional target of metformin is
Stat3 and it has been shown that metformin can inhibit the
growth of TNBC [318]. Additional Stats may be important

Recently it was demonstrated that combining a pan
PI3K inhibitor (XL 147) with Herceptin may overcome
herceptin-resistance in breast cancer by suppressing
HER2/PI3K/FOXO/survivin signaling [278].
Clinical trials have been performed examining the
ability to combine lapatinib, herceptin with paclitaxel
in first line HER2+ positive breast cancer patients. The
dose limiting toxicity observed in the study was diarrhea
[279]. Clinical studies examining the combination of
the mTORC1 blocker everolimus and either 4HT or
exemestane (Aromasin) have been reviewed [280].
Previous clinical studies combining endocrine therapy
with rapalogs to treat metastatic hormone receptor+ breast
cancer patients yielded variable results. However, two
recent independent trials which selected patients refractory
to endocrine therapy, demonstrated that combining the
rapalog everolimus (Afinitor) with 4HT or combining
everolimus with exemestane (Aromasin) was more
effective than either endocrine agent alone. The rapalogs
may sensitize the normally endocrine therapy resistant
patients to endocrine therapy. Likewise additional clinical
trials with HER2+ breast cancer patients and the inclusion
of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may improve therapy of the
HER2 inhibitors.

Figure 7: Induction of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Pathway after Leukemia Therapy and Subsequent Effects on Cell
Cycle Progression, Survival Pathways and Protein Translation. After chemotherapy or radiotherapy there can be activation of
signaling pathways which can actually promote cell survival and may lead to therapy resistance. Chemotherapeutic drug treatment (shown
in irregular black oval) frequently results in the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (shown in black square). ROS can induce the
calcium calmodulin kinase (CaM-K) cascade which can induce Ras which can subsequently activate both the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades (most components of the two cascades which promote signaling are show in green ovals, transcription factors
activated by events are shown in yellow diamonds, transcription factors inactivated by events shown in black diamonds). Induction of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can result in the activation of many survival pathways, and regulate both cell
cycle progression as well as protein translation. Some of the phosphorylation events mediated by Akt actually serve to inhibit the activities
of key proteins such as the Foxo transcription factors and the murine double minute (MDM2) ubiquitin ligase (depicted in black ovals).
MDM2 serves to regulate p53 protein stability by ubiquitination, however when it is phosphorylated by Akt it is inactivated. Moreover
chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy can induce the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein shown in a black oval, which can
in turn phosphorylate and regulate p53. p53 can have complex positive and negative effects on cell growth (depicted in yellow diamond),
it can regulate the expression of p21 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitory protein-1 (p21Cip1) which controls cell cycle progression. p53 can
also control the transcription of genes such as Puma, Noxa and Bax which are involved in apoptosis (all of these molecules are shown in
black ovals, as they tend to inhibit cell cycle progression or promote apoptosis). Both Akt and ERK can phosphorylate p21Cip1 which alters
its activity and ability to inhibit cell growth (shown as black phosphorylation sites) and subsequently influence cell growth and therapy
resistance. p27Kip1 can also be phosphorylated by both Akt and ERK, however the effects of these phosphorylation events are unclear. Akt
phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in its cytoplasmic localization, while ERK phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in elevated levels of
the protein. Hence phosphorylation of proteins by ERK and Akt can have dramatic effects on cell proliferation and contribute to the therapy
resistance. Chemo- and radiotherapy also induce breaks in the DNA. In the presence of functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 (indicated in yellow
ovals) these breaks may be repaired and normal gene transcription can occur. However when BRCA1 or BRCA2 are mutated, the repair of
these genes may not occur and proper gene transcription might not occur. This figure serves as an introduction as to how activation of these
pathways by chemotherapy and radiotherapy may contribute to therapeutic resistance.

in the progression of breast cancer [319].
Drug resistance may involve multiple approaches
such as pumping the compound out of the cell, modifying
or detoxifying the drug, or activating survival signaling
pathways that prevent drug-induced apoptosis [287]. ATPbinding cassette transporters such as multidrug resistance
protein (MRP1) and the MDR1 product, P-glycoprotein
(Pgp), actively expel chemotherapeutic drugs from the cell
[239,240]. Drug transporters pumps have been detected
in a large number of untreated breast cancers, and their
expression increases upon chemotherapy exposure [320].
Certain (e.g., EGFR inhibitors) targeted therapeutics
antagonize drug transporter activity [321]. Certain CDK4
inhibitors antagonize the response of breast cancer
cells to antracyclines [322]. Activation of cell survival
pathways such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway
can prevent apoptosis in the presence of a drug by altering

mitochondrial bioenergetics and inhibiting the release of
cytochrome c and result in resistance to autophagy [323329]. The tumor microenvironment and metabolism may
influence the response to targeted therapy as well as drug
resistance of breast cancer [330]. Genes and biotargets are
being identified which can confer resistance or sensitivity
to other targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors
[331,332].

preferentially sensitive to the anti-diabetes drug metformin
compared to the non-CIC JIMT(BC) population.
Furthermore, inclusion of metformin in tumor xenograft
studies increased the ability of Herceptin to suppress
the growth of JIMT xenografts. These important studies
document the potential usefulness of metformin in the
treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients [298].
Similar studies were performed with a herceptinsensitive (SKBR3-TzbS) and a derivative Herceptinresistant (SKBR3-TzbR) breast cancer cell lines. While
herceptin inhibited the formation of mammospheres from
herceptin-sensitive (SKBR3-TzbS), it did not suppress
the formation of mammospheres from herceptin-resistant
(SKBR3-TzbR) cells. Metformin would reduce the
formation of mamospheres from both cell types but the
SKBR3-TzbR cells were more sensitive to metformin.
Metformin could be combined with herceptin and
synergistically reduced mammosphere formation ability
in SKBR-TzbR cells [333].

In Tables 1-3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3, we
present the listing of clinical trials with breast cancer
patients derived from the ClinicalTrials.gov data base. We
have focused our searches to the key pathways discussed
in this review. Table 1 presents the clinical trials with
single inhibitors (mono therapy) such as PI3K, PI3K/
mTOR, Akt, mTOR inhibitors and mTORC1 blockers
(Everolimus, Temsirolimus, Rapamycin). Some trials have
presented publication regarding their clinical trials, either
in the form of abstracts or scientific manuscripts [333340]. In Table 2, we list the trials which have used 2 or
more agents, usually a combination of inhibitors which
target two different signaling pathways. Table 3 lists
clinical trials which often combine a signal transduction
inhibitor with chemotherapy. Some of these clinical trails
have presented publications in the database [341-343].
In Supplementary Table 1, clinical trials which combine
hormonal therapy with targeted or chemotherapy are
presented. Some of these clinical trails have presented
publications in the database [344-350]. Clinical trials
using metformin as a single agent are presented in
Supplementary Table 2. Finally clinical trails combining
metformin and AIs and other drugs are presented in
Supplementary Table 3 as well as a publication from one
study [351].

Induction of EMT can lead to Herceptin
Resistance.
Induction of EMT in breast cancer is also another
mechanism of resistance to such drugs as herceptin [334].
HER2 is also associated with breast cancer stem cells and
their aggressiveness [335]. Inherent herceptin resistance
in HER2+ breast cancers is a significant problem and
it has been reported to be as high as 70% [334]. In the
above study, basal HER2+ breast cancer cells resistant to
herceptin were infected with lentiviruses containing small
hairpin (sh) RNAs specific for EMT-specific transcription
factors. The authors had determined appropriate genes
to target by analysis of the public Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory (LBL) Breast Cancer Collection database.
These authors demonstrated that herceptin
sensitivity was restricted to the SLUG/SNAIL2-negative
subset of luminal/HER2+ cell lines. In contrast, breast
cancer lines which expressed SLUG/SNAIL2 were
inherently resistance to herceptin. Knockdown of SLUG/
SNAIL2 suppressed the CIC phenotype by upregulating
the expression of the luminal epithelial marker CD24 in
basal/HER2+ cells and these cells were also sensitive to
herceptin and underwent the mesenchymal to epithelial
transition (MET). This important study also documented
a reduction in tumor growth and sensitivity to herceptin
when SLUG and SNAIL2 were knocked-down in HER+
cells in tumor xenograft studies. This group has also
postulated that other mechanisms may be involved in
the induction of herceptin-refractory CICs from more
differentiated cells via the activation of intrinsic or
microenvironmental paths-to-stemness, also involving
EMT [336].

SUMMARY
HER2, EGFR1, EGFRvIII and the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway are clearly important not only in the
development of breast cancer, but also in the classification
and prognosis of breast cancer patients which display
mutations or changes in the expression of components of
these pathways. Both HER2 and PIK3CA are aberrantly
expressed or mutated in many breast cancers. These genes
may be altered in breast CICs and successful targeting of
them may prove to be effectively therapeutically. HER2
and PI3K control the expression of many downstream
genes involved in many different biological processes
including protein translation and gene transcription.
