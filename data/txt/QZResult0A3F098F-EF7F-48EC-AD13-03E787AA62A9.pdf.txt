Abstract
The novel multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib is
used as an antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of several
types of cancer, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). Sunitinib was shown to positively change the immunosuppressive phenotype in RCC patients. To improve its
antitumor efficacy, and offer strategies for its combination
with other approaches, it is critical to fully elucidate its
mechanisms of action. We show that sunitinib induces tumor
cell apoptosis and growth arrest in RCC tumor cells, which
correlates with signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (Stat3) activity inhibition. Sunitinib-mediated direct effects
on tumor cells occur regardless of von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor gene status and hypoxia-inducible transcription
factor-2A levels. Reduction of Stat3 activity enhances the
antitumor effects of sunitinib, whereas expression of a
constitutively activated Stat3 mutant rescues tumor cell
death. Intravital multiphoton microscopy data show that
sunitinib induces mouse Renca tumor cell apoptosis in vivo
before tumor vasculature collapse. Sunitinib also inhibits
Stat3 in Renca tumor–associated myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC), down-regulates angiogenic gene expression, and
reduces MDSCs and tumor T regulatory cells. These results
suggest that Stat3 activity is important for RCC response to
sunitinib, and Stat3 inhibition permits the direct proapoptotic activity of sunitinib on tumor cells and positive effects
on tumor immunologic microenvironment. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Sunitinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to
selectively inhibit several growth factor receptors, including
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), 2
(VEGFR2), and 3 (VEGFR3); platelet-derived growth factor receptor
a (PDGFRa) and h (PDGFh); and stem cell factor (1, 2). Recent
research has explored the potential antiangiogenic effects of
sunitinib, given the critical role of many of these receptor kinases
in tumor angiogenesis (1, 2). Sunitinib has been shown in vitro to
inhibit the VEGF-induced mitogenic response of human endothelial
cells, to abrogate migration of endothelial cells, and to inhibit their

ability to form capillary-like tubes (1–3). In vivo, sunitinib treatment
reduced tumor microvessel density, inhibited neovascularization in
a tumor vascular window model, and prevented metastasis in a lung
carcinoma model (4). Based on these observations, sunitinib has
been evaluated in the clinic as an antiangiogenic agent in several
types of cancer, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; refs. 1, 2). It has shown improvements in progression-free when compared with IFN-a therapy in
metastatic RCC patients (5) and has become a frontline therapy for
this disease (6, 7). However, its clinical effects remain suboptimal
(8), suggesting the need to further explore the mechanisms of action
of sunitinib, at both the cellular and molecular levels, so as to
facilitate its rational and effective combinatorial use.
Although sunitinib has been explored in the clinic mainly for its
antiangiogenesis effects, a recent report of tumor biopsy results
from a GIST patient treated with sunitinib showed marked tumor
response in the form of tumor cell necrosis, which was not
associated with reduction in tumor vasculature (9). Other reports
also suggested sunitinib effects on glioma cells, although no
detailed molecular mechanisms were included (10). Recent clinical
studies also indicated that sunitinib treatment reduced the number
of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC; ref. 11), improved Th-1
response, and diminished T regulatory cells (Treg) in RCC patients
(8). However, the underlying mechanism(s) mediating sunitinibinduced tumor cell apoptosis in GIST patients and reducing
immunosuppressive cells in RCC patients remains unknown.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is
constitutively activated in diverse cancer cell types, including RCC
(12, 13). Frequent Stat3 activation in tumor cells is largely due to the
fact that Stat3 is a point of convergence for numerous tyrosine
kinases, including VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, and Src (12, 14). Stat3 is
also activated in diverse tumor-associated immune cells, including
myeloid cells, promoting tumor immune evasion as well as tumor
angiogenesis (15–17). Stat3 mediates tumor immune evasion by
inhibiting expression of Th-1 immunostimulatory molecules and
by promoting production of immunosuppressive factors (16–18).
Ablating Stat3 in tumor myeloid cells increased dendritic cell
activation, tumor Treg reduction, and CD8+ T-cell activation (17, 19).
Recently, it was documented that Stat3 was critically involved in
tumor accumulation of MDSCs, which play an important role in
suppressing antitumor immune responses (S100A9; ref. 20).
In the current study, we assessed the direct effects of sunitinib
on RCC tumor cells in vitro and in vivo as well as its effects on the
tumor immunologic microenvironment.

In vivo experiments. Female BALB/c mice (7–8 wk old) were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory. Animal use procedures were approved by the
institutional committee of the Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope
Medical Center. For s.c. tumor challenge, female BALB/c mice were
implanted s.c. with 2.5  106 Renca cells. After tumors reached 5 to 7 mm in
diameter, sunitinib or vehicle control was administered orally, once a day, at
dose levels of 40, 20, and 10 mg/kg body weight. Tumor growth was
monitored every other day.
Flow cytometry. Preparation and staining of single-cell suspensions of
spleen, lymph node, or tumor tissues were as described previously (17).
Proliferation assay. Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (5,000 per
well) in DMEM with 5% FBS and allowed to attach overnight. Vehicle
(DMSO) or drug was added at different concentrations the following day.
After 24 or 48 h of treatment, cell proliferation assays were performed using
CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured at
490 nm using Mikrotek Laborsysteme. Experiments were done in triplicate
and repeated a minimum of three times.
Apoptotic assays. Cells (3  105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in
DMEM with 5% FBS and treated the following day with sunitinib (24 or

for flow cytometry measurement of apoptosis levels. Cells were analyzed
using FlowJo as described above.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized with iScript cDNA Synthesis (Bio-Rad).
Primers for human Stat3, survivin, Bcl-xL, and Cdc25A and mouse-specific
primers of VEGF and CXCL2 were purchased from SuperArray Bioscience
Corp. Human and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
primers were used as an endogenous control. Sequence-specific amplification was detected with increased fluorescent signal of SYBR Green (BioRad) with a Chromo4 Real-time PCR Detector (Bio-Rad).
Live cell imaging and immunofluorescence. Murine 3T3/v-Src
fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA5/TO/FRT-Stat3-CFP-YFP (a kind

gift of Michael Vogt, Klinikum Aachen, Aachen, Germany) using Lipofectamine 2000 and then treated with sunitinib (20 Amol/L, 2 h). Localization of
Stat3-CY in living cells was analyzed using an LSM 510 Meta Inverted
microscope (Zeiss). Tumor sections were stained using indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (15).
Intravital multiphoton microscopy. BALB/c mice bearing Renca
tumors were anaesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen followed by i.v. injection
(via retro-orbital route) with dextran-rhodamine (100 Ag; Molecular Probes),
Hoechst 33342 (250 Ag), and Annexin V-FITC (10 Ag; BioVision). Fifteen
minutes later, tumor tissues in mice were surgically exposed for intravital
multiphoton microscopy (IVMPM) and imaged with an Ultima Multiphoton
Microscopy System (Prairie Technologies). Hoechst 33342 (k = 730 nm) and
fluorescein conjugate and rhodamine (k = 860 nm) excitation wavelengths
were used. Band-pass filters optimized for Hoechst 33342 (BP k = 460/50
nm), fluorescein (BP k = 525/50 nm), and rhodamine (BP k = 570–620 nm)
were used for detection.
Statistics. A two-sided t test was used to evaluate differences between
treated and control groups (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01; and *, P < 0.05).

Results
Sunitinib induces RCC cell apoptosis and growth arrest. To
determine whether sunitinib has direct effects on RCC tumor cells,
we tested its ability to kill 786-O and RCC4 human RCC cell lines,
as well as murine Renca tumor cells. The effects of sunitinib on cell
death were dose dependent in all three tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A,
top). In addition to inducing RCC tumor cell apoptosis, sunitinib
also inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A, bottom). To confirm that sunitinib-induced tumor cell
death was associated with apoptosis, we examined the levels of
cleaved PARP. Results showed that for concentrations at which
sunitinib caused effective tumor cell death, there were
corresponding increases in cleaved PARP (Fig. 1B). Western blot
analyses were also performed to determine the downstream genes
mediating the effects of sunitinib on RCC cells. Sunitinib treatment
(24 hours) of 786-O, RCC4, and Renca tumor cells reduced
expression of several key antiapoptotic and pro-proliferation genes,
including cyclin E, cyclin D1, and survivin (Fig. 1B). Real-time
reverse transcription-PCR confirmed sunitinib down-regulation of
survivin in 786-O cells (Fig. 1B).
Effects of sunitinib on major oncogenic signaling pathways:
the role of Stat3. Because sunitinib is a known tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, we examined several major downstream signaling
molecules of tyrosine kinases, including AKT, mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), and Stat3. No inhibitory effects were
observed on p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 levels in 786-O cells following
2-hour sunitinib treatment (Fig. 2A). However, increased treatment
time (24 hours) and higher sunitinib concentration (10 Amol/L)
resulted in decreased p-ERK1/2 levels as well as a minor reduction

Figure 2. Effects of sunitinib on major oncogenic signaling pathways in 786-O
and RCC4 cells. Sunitinib reduced Stat3 and Src activity, with no dramatic
reduction of AKT, MAPK, and JAK signaling in 786-O (A) and RCC4 tumor cells
(B ). Tumor cells were treated with sunitinib at indicated concentrations for
2 h (left) or 24 h (right ). Total cell lysates were prepared and Western blots were
performed using relevant antibodies to detect total protein levels, with h-actin
used as the loading control. C, sunitinib inhibits activated Src and Stat3, leading
to cell apoptosis. 3T3 fibroblasts transformed by v-Src were transfected with
Stat3-CY and visualized by confocal microscopy. Top, Stat3-CY localization in
cells untreated (left) or treated (2 h) with sunitinib (right); bottom, sunitinib

Multiple Effects of Sunitinib

Figure 3. Levels of Stat3 activity affect the
direct antitumor effects of sunitinib.
A, Stat3 inhibition reduces expression of
genes important for survival and

and total cell lysates were collected
48 h after transfection. Left, Western
blot analyses of lysates with indicated
antibodies; right, total RNA was extracted

apoptosis and growth arrest. 786-O tumor
cells transfected with either control or Stat3
siRNA followed by treatment (24 h) with
sunitinib at indicated doses. Tumor cells
positive for both Annexin V and DAPI, as
determined by flow cytometry, were
considered apoptotic. Cell proliferation was
analyzed by MTS assay. Columns,

C, overexpression of a constitutively

786-O tumor cells containing a control
vector, pRC-vector, or the pRC-Stat3C
expression vector were treated (24 h) with
sunitinib at indicated concentrations.

in p-AKT levels. Similar results were observed in RCC4 cells
(Fig. 2B). We further assessed the potential effects of sunitinib on
JAK2, which is also frequently activated in cancer cells. RCC4
tumor cells contained constitutively activated p-JAK2 (Fig. 2B) and
Western blot data indicated that sunitinib had no inhibitory effect
on p-JAK2 in these cells. Elevated activated JAK2 (p-JAK2) was not
observed in 786-O tumor cells (data not shown).
Given that Stat3 is constitutively activated in diverse cancers,
including RCC (13), we assessed whether sunitinib-induced tumor
cell death was associated with Stat3 inhibition. Although sunitinib
had no effects on total Stat3 protein levels in tumor cells, it
inhibited p-Stat3 as early as 2 hours after sunitinib treatment, with
continued p-Stat3 inhibition at 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 2A
and B). The reduction of p-Stat3 correlated well with sunitinibinduced tumor cell death (Fig. 1A, top) and inhibition of tumor cell
proliferation, as shown by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt
(MTS) assay (Fig. 1A, bottom).
Because Src is a tyrosine kinase upstream of Stat3, and frequently
overactivated in diverse cancers (12, 22, 23), we examined the effects
of sunitinib on Src activity (p-Src). Similar to its effects on p-Stat3,
sunitinib effectively and rapidly inhibited Src activity (Fig. 2A and
B). To confirm sunitinib inhibitory effects on Src and Stat3, we used
3T3 fibroblasts transformed by v-Src to evaluate the subcellular
distribution of Stat3 following sunitinib treatment. Stat3-CFP-YFP
(Stat3-CY) was expressed in 3T3/v-Src cells and confocal microscopy was used to analyze Stat3-CY localization in living cells. When

www.aacrjournals.org

v-Src–transformed cells were treated with sunitinib, nuclear Stat3
translocated to the cytoplasm, indicating abrogation of Src-induced
Stat3 activation (Fig. 2C), which was accompanied by cell apoptosis
(Fig. 2C, bottom). These results suggested that Src tyrosine kinase
was also a target of sunitinib in RCC cells.
RCC cell apoptosis and growth arrest induced by sunitinib is
independent of VHL status and hypoxia-inducible factor-2a
levels. Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor
gene occur frequently in RCC cells, and the lack of a functional
VHL is associated with poor prognosis (21, 24). VHL inhibits
hypoxia-inducible factor-2a (HIF-2a) expression, thereby reducing
its ability to up-regulate VEGF expression, which is critical for
RCC progression (24). Recent publications have also indicated an
important role of HIF-2a in regulating renal tumor cell oncogenic
potential by up-regulating several c-myc downstream genes (25).
To test whether VHL status would affect RCC cell response to
sunitinib-induced tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation inhibition,
we compared the effects of sunitinib on RCC isotype tumor lines
with different VHL status and HIF-2a levels (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Stat3 is critical for sunitinib-induced direct antitumor
effects in RCC tumor cells. Our initial results (Fig. 1B) showed
that sunitinib treatment affected several Stat3 target genes
important for tumor cell survival and proliferation. Western blot
analyses of RCC cells treated with Stat3 siRNA confirmed that Stat3
inhibition reduced the expression of several known Stat3
downstream genes, such as survivin, cyclin E, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2
(Fig. 3A). These results suggested that sunitinib-induced RCC

tumor cell apoptosis and growth arrest was at least partially
mediated by Stat3 inhibition. To test whether combining Stat3
targeting and sunitinib treatment could lead to better antitumor
efficacy, RCC tumor cells were transfected with either control
siRNA (scrambled) or Stat3 siRNA and treated with increasing
doses of sunitinib. Combination treatment leads to small apoptotic
effects, resulting in enhanced tumor cell apoptosis as well as
inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 3B).
To provide direct evidence that Stat3 activity in RCC cells
affected sunitinib-induced tumor cell apoptosis, an expression
vector encoding a constitutively activated Stat3 mutant, Stat3C
(26), and an empty control vector were transfected into RCC cells
followed by selection of cells with the transfected vectors. Pooled
tumor cells that survived the antibiotic selection, and which were
positive for either the control vector or Stat3C-expressing vector,
were then treated with sunitinib. We found that expression of
the constitutively activated Stat3 mutant rendered RCC cells
significantly more resistant to sunitinib-induced tumor cell death
(Fig. 3C).
Sunitinib inhibits tumor Stat3 in vivo and induces tumor
cell apoptosis before collapse of tumor vasculature. We next
assessed whether sunitinib inhibited RCC tumor growth by
inducing tumor cell apoptosis through Stat3 inhibition. Western
blot analysis confirmed that sunitinib inhibited Stat3 in murine
Renca tumor cells in vitro (Fig. 4A, left). Sunitinib treatment of
Renca tumor–bearing mice, with clinically relevant doses
(10–40 mg/kg/d via oral administration; refs. 3, 27), resulted in
inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 4A, right), which was correlated
with a reduction in Stat3 activity in tumors (Fig. 4B, left) and a
reduction of cyclin E and survivin protein expression (Fig. 4B,
right). Consistent with that observed in RCC cell lines in vitro,
sunitinib inhibited p-Stat3 and p-Src effectively in growing
tumors as early as 24 hours after treatment (Fig. 5A, left). In
addition, similar to that seen in RCC tumor cells in vitro, the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

effects of sunitinib on p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 were not detectable
in growing tumors (Fig. 5A, left).
IVMPM was then used at different time points after treatment
to determine if sunitinib was able to directly induce tumor cell
apoptosis in vivo; to this aim, FITC-labeled Annexin V was injected
retro-orbitally shortly before microscopy assay to capture in vivo
tumor cell apoptosis. Dextran-rhodamine (red) and Hoechst (blue)
dyes were also given retro-orbitally to label blood vessels and cell
nuclei, respectively. Our data suggested that sunitinib induced
tumor cell apoptosis in vivo as early as 1 day after treatment, which
occurred in the presence of apparently intact tumor vessels
(Fig. 5A, right). There seemed to be more apoptosis in the tumor
on days 3 and 11 after treatment, with greater disruption of the
tumor vasculature (Fig. 5A, right). These data were confirmed by
fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal laser scanning
microscopy of frozen tumor sections stained for p-Stat3 (green),
endothelial cells (CD31/PECAM-1, red), and nuclei (Hoechst 33342,
blue), which showed that Stat3 was activated in tumor cells and
perhaps in tumor endothelial cells (Fig. 5B). Sunitinib treatment
reduced Stat3 activity and induced tumor cell death as early as
1 day after treatment (Fig. 5B). Although it is difficult to quantify
tumor vasculature, it seemed that CD31+ vessel structure was
readily detectable on days 1 and 5 after treatment (Fig. 5B). Taken
together, these data indicate that sunitinib inhibited tumor Stat3
activity in vivo and induced tumor cell death before tumor vessel
collapse.
Stat3 inhibition by sunitinib in tumor myeloid cells reduces
expression of angiogenic genes and number of immunosuppressive cells. A critical role of Stat3 in inhibiting dendritic cell
activity in tumors has been shown (17, 19). Inhibition of Stat3
signaling in tumor dendritic cells has also been shown to reduce
accumulation of tumor Tregs (17). We therefore used flow
cytometry and staining with antibodies against intracellular
p-Stat3 to assess whether sunitinib inhibited Stat3 in tumor

dendritic cells. Our data suggested that systemic sunitinib
treatment reduced tumor dendritic cell Stat3 activity and that
the observed reduction was associated with an up-regulation of
the costimulatory molecule CD80 (Fig. 6A). These results agreed
with previous genetic studies reporting a role for Stat3 in the
inhibition of costimulatory molecule expression (17).
A recent study also showed that Stat3 was constitutively
activated in tumor macrophages and MDSCs, promoting tumor
angiogenesis (15). Other studies identified Stat3 as an important
molecule in MDSC accumulation in tumor-bearing mice (20).
Because sunitinib inhibits Stat3 in tumor cells, we tested whether it
also inhibited Stat3 in tumor-associated myeloid cells. Western blot
analysis of p-Stat3 of MDSCs isolated from tumor-free and Renca
tumor–bearing mice indicated that Stat3 activity was elevated in
tumor-associated CD11b+/CD11c myeloid cells (Fig. 6B), which
include MDSCs and macrophages. Treating mice systemically
with sunitinib inhibited Stat3 activity in MDSCs and macrophages
(Fig. 6B). However, sunitinib did not have notable inhibitory effects
on p-AKT and p-ERK in the tumor-associated MDSCs (Fig. 6B).
Consistent with the antiangiogenic effects of Stat3 ablation in
tumor macrophages and MDSCs (15), sunitinib-induced Stat3
inhibition correlated with down-regulation of several Stat3-

regulated angiogenic genes, as determined by real-time PCR
(Fig. 6B, right). Supporting a critical role of Stat3 in promoting
tumor MDSC accumulation, flow cytometric analyses to detect
CD11b+/Gr1+ MDSCs indicated that inhibition of Stat3 by sunitinib
was accompanied by a significant reduction in MDSCs (Fig. 6C) as
well as tumor-infiltrating Tregs (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Our results showed that sunitinib inhibited Stat3 and induced
direct RCC tumor cell apoptosis, independent of tumor vasculature
destruction. Furthermore, sunitinib inhibition of Stat3 in tumorassociated myeloid cells was accompanied by a reduction of
MDSCs and tumor-infiltrating Tregs. These findings warrant
evaluation of Stat3 as a biomarker for sunitinib response and
resistance in RCC clinical trials and establish the evolving paradigm
of using these targeted agents to assist in the combined targeted/
immunologic and potential curative approaches to this disease.
Our data indicated that RCC tumor cell apoptosis correlated
with Stat3 inhibition and that persistent Stat3 activation rescued
tumor cells from sunitinib-induced death. Although activated AKT,
MAPK, and JAK2 were not significantly affected by sunitinib in RCC

Figure 5. Sunitinib inhibits tumor Stat3 activity in vivo, leading to tumor cell apoptosis, which occurs before tumor vessel collapse. A, BALB/c mice were challenged
with Renca tumor cells and then treated with sunitinib 7 d later. On indicated days after first sunitinib treatment, mice were given retro-orbital injections of FITC-labeled
Annexin V (green , to detect apoptotic cells), dextran-rhodamine (red , to stain vessels), and Hoechst 33342 (blue , to stain nuclei). IVMPM analysis was performed,
15 min after injection, on tumors grown in mice treated with vehicle or sunitinib. Western blot analysis of Renca tumor tissues harvested 1 d after sunitinib treatment
shows its effects on p-Stat3 and other indicated molecules. B, frozen tumor sections of vehicle- and sunitinib-treated tumors (same as in A ) were stained for
phosphotyrosine-Stat3 (pY-Stat3 ; green ), CD31/PECAM-1 (red), and Hoechst 33342 (blue ) and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Scale bar, 10 Am.

sunitinib on the tumor microenvironment.
A, CD11c+ dendritic cells were enriched
from Renca tumors harvested from mice
treated with either vehicle or sunitinib
(20 or 40 mg/kg orally). Flow cytometric
analyses of dendritic cell intracellular
levels of p-Stat3 in tumor and surface
expression of CD80 from tumor-draining
lymph nodes are shown. B, sunitinib
inhibits Src and Stat3 activity in
macrophages and MDSCs in Renca
tumor–bearing mice, leading to reduced
expression of several Stat3-regulated
angiogenic gene. Shown are Western

tumor cells, it is possible that these pathways might be affected by
sunitinib in other RCC tumor cells. Because RCC tumor cells, like
all cancer cells, have different genetic backgrounds with various
mutations, the cause of Stat3 activation is variable. Although our
results showed that inhibition of p-Src by sunitinib was important
for Stat3 down-regulation, other tyrosine kinases upstream of
Stat3, including VEGFR and PDGFR, in RCC tumor cells (12) can
also be targets of sunitinib, leading to inhibition of Stat3. At the
same time, whether sunitinib can inhibit Stat3 in tumor cells
with activated interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and other cytokine
receptor signaling remains to be determined. Further studies in this
area should allow for the rational design of clinical trials to
effectively block Stat3 in RCC tumor cells. For example, if sunitinib
does not effectively block IL-6 receptor-induced Stat3 activation, it
might be desirable to combine sunitinib with IL-6–directed therapy
(e.g., antibody therapy).
Our in vivo studies involving murine RCC Renca tumors
indicated that sunitinib inhibited Stat3 activity in tumor cells,
perhaps also in tumor endothelial cells. Tumor cell apoptosis

correlated with inhibition of Stat3 in growing tumors but not with
p-AKT or p-ERK. In addition, tumor cell apoptosis occurred before
tumor vasculature collapse, suggesting tumor cell apoptosis was an
independent factor affecting RCC response to sunitinib. Recent
studies have also indicated the importance of Stat3 for tumor
angiogenesis and metastasis (12, 28). Stat3 is constitutively
activated not only in tumor cells but also in tumor endothelial
and myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and
MDSCs (15, 17), promoting the expression of a large number of
angiogenic and metastatic factors (12, 28). Inhibition of Stat3
activity in tumor, endothelial, or myeloid cells reduces endothelial
migration and potential to form capillary tubes in vitro and in vivo
(15). Because Stat3 is also downstream of VEGFR, basic fibroblast
growth factor receptor, and PDGFR (12), it is likely that Stat3
inhibition contributes to the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib.
However, additional studies are required to further test this
hypothesis. On the other hand, our results showed that sunitinib
inhibits Src/Stat3 activity in tumor-associated MDSCs, reducing
expression of several Stat3-regulated angiogenic genes in MDSCs

Multiple Effects of Sunitinib

derived from sunitinib-treated mice. These findings support our
previous results showing a role of Stat3 in tumor macrophages and
MDSCs in promoting tumor angiogenesis (15).
A recent published study showed that sunitinib induces Th-1
immune response (IFN-g expression) while reducing Tregs in RCC
cancer patients, although the underlying mechanism is unknown
(8). It seems that in patients, sunitinib has an indirect inhibitory
effect on Tregs (8). In a related study, it was suggested that
sunitinib treatment in RCC patients reduced the number of MDSCs
(11). It is possible that the reduction of Tregs by sunitinib
treatment in RCC patients is mediated by a down-regulation of
MDSCs and/or increase in IFN-g production. Constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells and MDSCs has
been shown in several murine tumor models and human tumor
specimens (15, 17). Inhibiting Stat3 in tumor-infiltrating dendritic
cells has also been correlated with their activation, reduction of
tumor-infiltrating Tregs, and activation of CD8+ effector cells (17).
Furthermore, recent studies showed that tumor-infiltrating MDSC/
macrophages displayed highly activated Stat3 (15) and that Stat3
was critical for up-regulation of myeloid-related protein S100A9,
which inhibited dendritic cell differentiation and MDSC accumulation in cancer (20). Our current study further showed that
sunitinib administration in Renca tumor–bearing mice led to the
inhibition of Stat3 in tumor-associated myeloid cells, including
dendritic cells and MDSCs, which was accompanied by a reduction

of tumor Tregs. These results suggest that the immunomodulating
effects of sunitinib in RCC patients might be mediated by Stat3
inhibition and that the direct antiapoptotic effects of sunitinib
against RCC tumor cells were, at least in part, associated with Stat3
inhibition. These findings warrant further clinical investigation to
evaluate Stat3 as biomarker for sunitinib response and resistance
in RCC patients and to explore the use of combinatory approaches,
including molecular targeting and immunotherapies, to enhance
the antitumor efficacy of sunitinib against immunologically
responsive tumor such as RCC.
