ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to characterize HIV-1 genotypes and antiretroviral
resistance mutations among treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals in Jiaxing,
China. The HIV-1 partial polymerase (pol) genes in 93 of the 99 plasma samples were
successfully amplified and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of
five HIV-1 genotypes, of which the most prevalent genotype was CRF01_AE (38.7%),
followed by CRF07_BC (34.4%), CRF08_BC (16.1%), subtype B/B’ (5.4%), and
CRF55_01B (2.1%). Besides, three types of unique recombination forms (URFs) were
also observed, including C/F2/A1, CRF01_AE/B, and CRF08_BC/CRF07_BC. Among
93 amplicons, 46.2% had drug resistance-associated mutations, including 23.7%
for protease inhibitors (PIs) mutations, 1.1% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs) mutations, and 20.4% for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NNRTIs) mutations. Six (6.5%) out of 93 treatment-naive subjects were
identified to be resistant to one or more NNRTIs, while resistance to NRTIs or PIs was
not observed. Our study showed the genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains circulating in
Jiaxing and a relative high proportion of antiretroviral resistance mutations among
treatment-naive patients, indicating a serious challenge for HIV prevention and
treatment program.

also been demonstrated. Actually, new CRFs and URFs
continue to be identified and HIV diversity continues
to increase [2]. The global distribution of HIV-1
genotypes is extremely complex and dynamic, and
specific distributions of genotypes vary among different
continents [3]. Globally, the most predominant subtype
is subtype C that has spread to different continents,
followed by subtype A and B; Subtype B dominates
in North America, Western and Central Europe, the
Caribbean, Latin America, and Australia [4]. All groups,
subtypes and many CRFs have been reported in Africa
[5]; The Middle East is mainly affected by subtype B
and various CRFs; In India and Ethiopia the epidemics
are nearly caused by subtype C. The epidemic in Eastern

INTRODUCTION
HIV-1 remains a global public health problem
of unprecedented dimensions. According to the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),
there were 36.7 million (34.0 million-39.8 million)
people living with HIV in 2015 [1]. Phylogenetic
analysis allows classification of HIV-1 strains into four
groups: M, N, O and P. The group M, responsible for
the global HIV pandemic, has been further divided into
nine subtypes (A-D, F-H, J and K) and 79 circulating
recombinant forms (CRFs) to date (http://www.hiv.lanl.
gov/content/sequence/HIV/CRFs/CRFs.html). Besides,
a proportion of unique recombinant forms (URFs) have

Europe and Central Asia is dominated by subtype A and
B, while in South and Southeast Asia being CRF01_AE.
In East Asia the epidemic is dominated by CRF07_BC,
CRF08_BC, CRF01_AE and B [4].
Since antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been
made available to AIDS patients, the number of patients
received the ART has increased rapidly, an estimated 17
million people were accessing life-saving antiretroviral
medicines at the end of 2015 according to UNAIDS
[1]. The ART has reduced the morbidity and mortality
associated with HIV infection, however the great success
of ART is now threatened by HIV drug resistance [6]. The
new ART recommendations (“treat all”) and the scale-up
of pre-exposure prophylaxis [7] using antiretroviral drugs
are likely to induce the HIV strains to mutate more quickly
under the drug selection pressure. HIV drug resistance
has already been observed among treatment-naive
patients in China [8–10]. These reports merit attention
that the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance may
compromise the effect of current therapeutic regimens
potentially or directly and stress the urgent need to
intensify the routine implementation of HIV drug
resistance surveys.
Located in the Yangtze River Delta region and
northeast of Zhejiang province of China, Jiaxing is a
city with very well-developed manufacturing industries
attracting large numbers of migrant-workers each
year. Since the first case of Jiaxing was detected in
1998, the HIV-1 infection rate has been increasing
annually in this city. The HIV epidemiological survey
of Jiaxing in 2015 showed that 255 newly diagnosed
HIV-1 infected individuals came from 21 provinces as
well as municipals, of which the migrants accounted
for about 60% of the total infected cases, indicating
infections among migrants are a big factor in the HIV1 epidemic in this city. However, little is known on
molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Jiaxing, thus our
group examined genetic characteristics and antiretroviral
resistance mutations among treatment-naive HIV-1
infected patients living in the city.

Phylogenetic trees based on pol genes revealed
that a majority of the HIV-1 isolates (36, 38.7%) studied
belonged to the CRF01_AE, followed by CRF07_BC
(32, 34.4%), CRF08_BC (15, 16.1%), subtype B/B’
(5, 5.4%), CRF55_01B (2, 2.1%) (Figure 1, Figure
2). The jpHMM-HIV and bootscanning analyses were
performed on three sequences, which did not cluster
with any present known references. The results revealed
the presence of C/F2/A1 intersubtype recombinant
strains with different mosaic structures from those of
A1, C and F2 in one sample (CNJX53), the second
recombination (CNJX26) was among the CRF and
subtype, i.e. CRF01_AE/B, while the third (CNJX55)
was among CRFs, i.e. CRF08_BC/CRF07_BC (Figure
3). The sequence analysis revealed a broad diversity in
the samples studied.
The distribution of HIV-1 strains was uneven among
different risk groups. CRF08_BC strains were more likely
to be found among heterosexually infected individuals (12,
80%); While most CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC strains
were detected in two groups: homosexually infected
individuals (20, 55.6%), (10, 31.3%) and heterosexually
infected individuals (14, 38.9%), (18, 56.3%) respectively
(Table 2).

Genotypic analysis of HIV-1 drug resistance
Pol genes were successfully amplified from 93 HIV
positive samples and were subjected to drug resistance
analysis including PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistanceassociated mutations through the Stanford HIV Drug
Resistance Database. Among our subjects, 46.2% of the
amplicons (43/93) contained drug resistance-associated
mutations, including 23.7% (22/93) for PI mutations,
1.1% (1/93) for NRTI mutations, and 20.4% (19/93)
for NNRTI mutations. PI mutations, such as T74S,
L10I, A71T/V, K20I, V11I, were all minor mutations
which by themselves showed no significant effect
on phenotypes, but might affect the progress of drug
resistance or improve replication of viruses containing
major mutations [14]. Among samples with reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) resistance mutations,
only one sample harbored NRTI resistance mutation,
i.e. T69N, which did not give any resistance to NRTIs;
Among samples with NNRTI resistance mutations, the
most frequent amino acid substitutions were at the 138th
and 179th codon of the reverse transcriptase gene, such
as the E138A/K/G (3.2%, 3/93), V179D/E/A/T mutation
(9.7%, 9/93), all were rilpivirine (RPV) resistanceassociated major or minor mutations [15] (Table 3);
Overall, only six individuals (6.5%) showed low to highlevel resistance to efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR),
rilpivirine (RPV), nevirapine (NVP), all were NNRTIs
(Table 4); K103N, conferring a high-level resistance to

NVP and EFV, found in three (50%, 3/6) samples, was
one of the most common NNRTI-related mutations;

consistent with the previous study in Zhejiang province
[16]. Three URFs, i.e. CRF01_AE/B, C/F2/A1, CRF08_
BC/CRF07_BC were also identified, of which two
subjects were migrant workers, one was an intravenous
drug user from Yunnan province (data not shown). The
number of possible URFs detected may be underestimated
in this study because only the partial pol gene is sequenced
providing limited information on recombination. The
identification of CRFs and URFs indicated the high
genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains circulating in Jiaxing.

DISCUSSION
Our study firstly detected HIV-1 subtypes and
CRFs currently circulating in Jiaxing among treatmentnaive individuals. HIV-1 subtype B/B’, CRF01_AE,
CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and CRF55_01B were identified,
of which CRF01_AE was the predominant genotype,

Genetic variability of HIV results from the high mutation
and recombination rates, together with high replication
capacity of the virus [17, 18]. Of note is that recombination
requires coinfection or superinfection of viral strains
within an individual [19], indicating that coinfection and/
or superinfection occur at an alarming speed in Jiaxing.
Besides, the migration of HIV-1 infected individuals
can also promote viral recombination. Therefore, for

Jiaxing, a city with lots of migrant workers flowing into,
it is important to identify the genotype to monitor the
dynamics and complexity of the HIV epidemic.
Since 1980s, about 40 kinds of antiretroviral
drugs have been approved by US Food and Drug
Administration, which greatly decreased the morbidity
and mortality of HIV infection [20]. However, HIV drug
resistance in treatment-naive individuals is increasing

worldwide, which may result from the transmission
of emergent drug-resistant virus strains to treatmentnaive individuals [21]. Our observed drug resistance
prevalence (6.5%) in treatment-naive individuals is
classified as a moderate level (5%-15%) according to
the WHO classification [22], which was similar to the
drug resistance prevalence in the recent HIV infections
in Zhejiang province, China [8], higher than transmitted
drug resistance rates between 2004 (2.9%) and
2005(4.4%) in a nationwide investigation of China when
the main transmission route was blood donation [23],
lower than those in US and Europe where rates were
reported to be 14.6% (2006) [24] and 8.9% (2002-2007)
[25], South African with pre-treatment HIV-1 resistance
prevalence of 9.0% during 2013 to 2014 [26].

Currently, the most common regimen for HIV
patients in Jiaxing contains a combination of a NNRTI
plus two NRTIs, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF) / azidothymidine (AZT) + lamivudine (3TC) +EFV/
NVP. It was noteworthy that in our study all six patients
were resistant to NNRTIs (EFV, ETR, RPV, NVP), while
resistance to NRTIs or PIs was not observed. Previous
study showed that NNRTIs had a low genetic barrier to
drug resistance, a single amino acid change might be
sufficient for high-level drug resistance, such as K103N,
which had limited effect on viral replication and persisted
long after transmission [27, 28]. Besides, NNRTIs usually
have longer plasma half-lives than NRTIs [29], making
it remain longer in plasma than NRTIs once a patient
stops taking drugs, thus induce drug resistance mutations

more easily; The above reasons may help explain why
all resistant subjects were against NNRTIs. Besides,
researches showed that NNRTIs-related mutations
increased significantly among newly diagnosed HIVinfected patients in Europe [25, 30], implying us to pay
attention to NNRTIs-related mutations. Surveillance of
drug resistance mutations among treatment-naive patients
will be necessary, thus European and USA guideline
panels have already recommended drug-resistance
testing prior to treatment [31, 32]. It is hoped that in the
future baseline genotypic drug resistance testing can be
performed in China to guide doctors select the optimal
regimen for a particular patient.
One limitation of our study is that we used standard
dideoxynucleotide sequencing, although used as a
standard method in HIV drug-resistance testing, fails to
identify drug-resistance minority variants that are below
20% of the virus population [33], those minorities can be
clinically important as they may grow under drug pressure
and lead to treatment failure, thus the method probably
underestimates the real prevalence of resistance mutations
among treatment-naive patients.
The high genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains and
a relative high proportion of antiretroviral resistance
mutations among treatment-naive patients pose a serious
challenge for HIV prevention and treatment program
in Jiaxing; It was noteworthy that most subjects had
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

relatively low levels of education, therefore strengthening
propaganda and education of HIV prevention knowledge
would be very necessary. This is the first cross-sectional
survey describing the genetic characterization of HIV-1
and patterns of PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistance-associated
mutations among treatment-naive patients living in
Jiaxing, which may provide some implications for future
HIV prevention and antiretroviral treatment strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
A total of 104 HIV-1 infected patients living in
Jiaxing were enrolled continuously from April 2015 to
February 2016. HIV-1 infection in these patients was
confirmed by western blot. Of which 5 patients received
ART, the remaining 99 subjects were self-reported to be
treatment-naive. The epidemiology data were collected
by trained interviewers. The study was approved by the
Review Board of Jiaxing Municipal Center for Disease
Control and Prevention and conducted according to the
principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of
Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent
prior to participating in this study. The participants were
simultaneously informed of their right to repeal consent by
them or their kin, guardians, or caretakers.
