ABSTRACT
The mechanisms of cisplatin resistance, one of the major limitations of current
chemotherapy, has only partially been described. We previously demonstrated
that cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells (C13), are characterized by reduced
mitochondrial activity and higher glucose-dependency when compared to the cisplatinsensitive counterpart (2008). In this work we further characterized the role of
metabolic transformation in cisplatin resistance. By using transmitochondrial hybrids
we show that metabolic reprogramming of cisplatin-resistant cell is not caused by
inherent mtDNA mutations. We also found that C13 cells not only present an increased
glucose-uptake and consumption, but also exhibit increased expression and enzymatic
activity of the Pentose Phosphate pathway (PPP) enzyme Glucose-6-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Moreover, we show that cisplatin-resistant cells are
more sensitive to G6PDH inhibition. Even if the metabolomic fingerprint of ovarian
cancer cells remains to be further elucidated, these findings indicate that PPP offers
innovative potential targets to overcome cisplatin resistance.

to the onset of mutations that lead to mitochondrial
dysfunction, oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis [3, 4, 5]. The cisplatin therapeutic effectiveness
is limited by side effects (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity) [6] and by the emergence of resistance [7],
a multi-factorial phenomenon, linked to reduced drug
accumulation, inactivation by thiol-containing species,
increased repair of platinum-DNA adducts, enhanced
tolerance to cisplatin adducts and desensitization to cell
death pathways [8, 9, 10]. These mechanisms are cell linedependent, so that a particular tumor may exhibit one, two
or even all the above-mentioned mechanisms [11].
In our previous studies we demonstrated that
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibit lower levels
of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and increased steady

INTRODUCTION
Cisplatin is one of the most potent anticancer agents
used in the treatment of various solid tumors including
testicular, lung and ovarian cancer [1]. Despite the
chemotherapeutic advances of the last decades, cisplatin
still remains the first-line chemotherapeutic agent against
epithelial malignancies, used alone or in combination
with radiotherapy and/or other anticancer compounds.
Cisplatin has been shown to induce the formation of
inter- and intra-strand nuclear DNA (nDNA) cross-links
that, by hindering both RNA transcription and DNA
replication, lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [2].
Cisplatin has also been shown to bind to mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA), which, unlike nDNA, is more susceptible

state levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) [12] suggesting
that cisplatin-resistance can also be associated with the
variation of intracellular redox status. It is well established
that GSH plays a key role in the antioxidant capabilities of
cancer cells, but it is important to remember that GSH also
acts forming complexes with cisplatin, thereby reducing
the amount of intracellular drug available for interaction
with all nucleophilic sites [13].
Cancer cells undergo profound metabolic changes
required to fuel the biosynthetic demands of cell
growth and division [14, 15] and to maintain the redox
homeostasis. This metabolic rewiring is orchestrated
by oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which fine tune
several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis,
oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate
pathway and glutaminolysis [16]. Indeed, the increase
in glucose metabolism, that hallmarks most cancer cells,
is instrumental not only for ATP generation or for the
synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids, but also for
the maintenance of redox homeostasis via the NADPHproducing Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) [17]. The
rate-limiting and “gatekeeper” enzyme of the PPP is
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), whose
activity is regulated by the availability of its substrate and
by the NADP+/NADPH ratio [18] and directly reflects
the partitioning of glucose utilization between glycolysis
and oxidative PPP [19]. However, whether the metabolic
reprogramming of cancer supports cisplatin resistance is
currently unknown.
To shed some light on the metabolic determinants
of cisplatin resistance, we had investigated the metabolic
changes that occur in cisplatin–resistant ovarian cancer
cells (C13), finding that they exhibit reduced oxygen
consumption and increased dependency on glucose, when
compared to their cisplatin-sensitive counterpart (2008)
[20]. In this work we have further characterized the role
of metabolic transformation in cisplatin resistance. We
show that cisplatin induces deregulation of mitochondrial
function in resistant cells, in accord with their increased
usage of glucose, and that cisplatin-resistant cells rely
on the PPP to overcome cisplatin cytotoxicity. We also
demonstrate that the inhibition of the limiting enzyme of
the PPP, G6PDH, restores cisplatin sensitivity in cisplatinresistant cells.

polymorphisms in C13 cells: 8156 G>T, 12018 C>T,
13828 C>T. Their putative pathogenicity was assessed
by PolyPhen (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/),
a software application that predicts the impact of an
amino acid substitution on the structure and function of
a protein. The predicted pathogenicity of the 8156 G>T
and 13828 C>T polymorphisms was modest, whereas the
12018 C>T polymorphism resulted mildly pathogenic.
In order to investigate if these mtDNA polymorphisms
contributed to the altered mitochondrial function and
cisplatin resistance, we generated trans-mitochondrial
cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) (Supplementary Figure 1A
for a schematic representation of the experiment).
Interestingly, the cybrid lines (H2008 and HC13)
were equally sensitive to cisplatin, as demonstrated by
trypan blue exclusion  assay  and by Annexin V assay
(Supplementary Figure 1B–1C). In line with our previous
observations, cisplatin-resistant C13 cells presented lower
oxygen consumption (Figure 1A) and lower mitochondrial
potential (Figure  1B) when compared to 2008 cells.
Interestingly, both respiration and mitochondrial potential
defects were restored in the cybrid cell line HC13 and were
comparable to the original 2008 cells (Figure 1A–1B). We
further assessed the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction
in C13 cells and in cybrid cell lines by growing cells in
galactose medium. Of note, C13 cells were extremely
sensitive to these culture conditions (Figure 1C), whereas
their viability was not affected by long-term incubation
with the Complex I inhibitor rotenone (Figure 1D).
In further support of the restoration of mitochondrial
function in cybrids, growth of HC13 cells was not
affected by galactose, and HC13 cells became sensitive to
rotenone (Figure 1C–1D). Together, these results suggest
that the mitochondrial polymorphisms found in C13 cells
do not directly contribute to the observed mitochondrial
dysfunction and do not play a role in cisplatin resistance.

Cisplatin-resistant cells exhibit defects in
mitochondrial morphology and a reduction in
mitochondrial mass
We wanted to investigate whether decreased
oxygen consumption observed in C13 cells was caused
by a decrease in mitochondrial mass. To this aim, cells
were stained with mitotracker green (MTG), a potentialindependent mitochondrial probe, and mitochondrial mass
was analysed using confocal imaging. Of note, while the
mitochondrial network of C13 cells appeared scattered and
less structured than in 2008 cells (Figure 2A, left panels),
no differences in mitochondrial morphology between
H2008 and HC13 were observed (Figure 2A, right panels).
Importantly, C13 cells showed a dramatic decrease in
mitochondrial mass measured by Nonyl-Acridine Orange
(Figure 2B), which was consistent with a decrease in MTG
staining with respect to their 2008 counterpart (Figure 2C).
Since the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial

consequence of the damaging effects of cisplatin on
mtDNA. To this aim, the mtDNA of C13 cells and
of their cisplatin-sensitive counterpart 2008, was
sequenced (Table 1). These analyses revealed three major

biogenesis, except for PGC-1β, was not significantly
different between C13 and 2008 (Figure 2D), we reasoned
that the striking reduction in mitochondrial mass could be
caused by induction of mitochondrial specific autophagy
(mitophagy). Indeed, C13 cells exhibited a marked
increase in LC3 staining (Figure 2E), associated to a
significant overexpression of BNIP3 (Figure 2F), two key
markers of activated autophagy. These results indicate that
cisplatin-resistant cells exhibit defects in mitochondrial
morphology and a reduction in mitochondrial mass, which
are potentially associated to an increased activation of
mitophagy.

higher sensitivity to glucose deprivation (Figure  3C)
and the incubation with the glycolysis inhibitor
2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) led to significant cell death of
these cells (Figure 3D). To support these data we used
also another cancer cell line (human cervix squamous cell
line, A431) and its relative cisplatin resistant counterpart
(A431pt). A431pt, similarly to C13, presented a higher
glucose-dependency, increased GLUT1 expression, and
major sensitivity to galactose medium (Supplementary
Figure 2A–2D). Together, these results show that cisplatinresistant cells increase their demands of glucose and are
more sensitive to inhibition of glycolysis, when compared
to the cisplatin-sensitive counterpart.
Glutamine is a major source of carbons for
the mitochondria of cancer cells [21, 22]. In order
to investigate the biosynthetic role of glutamine, we
incubated C13 and 2008 cells with uniformly labelled
[U-13C]glutamine and analysed the isotopologue
distribution of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
intermediates. While the total pool of some TCA cycle
intermediates, including succinate and malate, was lower
in C13 than in 2008 cells (Figure 4A), the incorporation

Deregulation of glucose and glutamine

In line with a compensatory activation of glycolysis
in the presence of mitochondrial defects, C13 cells
exhibited increased glucose uptake (Figure 3A). Among
the glycolytic enzymes investigated, only the glucose
transporter GLUT1 was up-regulated in these cells
(Figure  3B). Of note, cisplatin-resistant cells exhibited

of glutamine-derived carbons into glutamate, succinate,
fumarate and malate was significantly higher in cisplatinresistant cells (Figure 4B). These results suggest that in the
presence of deregulated mitochondrial function, glutamine
becomes a privileged source of carbon for C13 cells.
In line with a functional relevance of glutamine, C13 cells,
differently from 2008 cells, showed a marked decrease in
cell proliferation when cultured in glutamine-free media
(Figure 4C and 4D).
Besides being a carbon source for the TCA
cycle, glutamine is a key precursor of glutamate,
required, among many functions, for the biosynthesis
of glutathione (GSH), a major redox buffer in the cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GSH has been proposed as an important molecule to
sustain cisplatin resistance, and the overexpression
of enzymes involved in GSH biosynthesis has been
documented in these cells [23]. Although GSH vs
GSSG ratio was similar between C13 and 2008 cells
(Supplementary Table 1), the amount of GSH and GSSG
was significantly higher in C13 cells (Figure 5A–5B).
Of note, the contribution of glutamine to GSH was
increased in C13 cells (Figure 5C), suggesting that a
portion of glutamine is used by cisplatin-resistant cells
to sustain GSH biosynthesis. These results indicate that
the metabolic reprogramming of cisplatin-resistant cells
may contribute to redox buffering.

combination of 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN, competitive
G6PDH inhibitor [24]) or dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA, uncompetitive G6PDH inhibitor [25]) and
cisplatin at concentrations lower than IC50. In order
to appropriately assess the effects of the combination
of 6-AN or DHEA and cisplatin, we performed
isobolographic analysis. The linearity of the iso-effective
concentrations producing 25% of cytotoxic effect strongly
indicates additivity (Figure 5G–5H). On the contrary, the
cytotoxic effect on 2008 was only due to the prevalent
cisplatin activity, which hindered the overall effect, so
an isobolograph could not be generated. Of note also in

on iso-effective concentrations of cisplatin and 6-AN
or DHEA producing 25% of cytotoxic effect, in A431pt
cells, the observed curves deviate from the theoretical
line show additivity for 6-AN and a modest synergism for
DHEA (Supplementary Figure 3C–3D). Taken together,
these results suggest that cisplatin-resistant cells exploit
the oxidative PPP as a resistance mechanism. Both
resistant cell lines did not show cross-resistance with
other chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel and
doxorubicin (see Supplementary Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
Cisplatin cytotoxicity has been originally ascribed
to interactions between cisplatin and nuclear DNA,
which lead to the formation of adducts that activate

the apoptotic machinery [2]. More recent data suggest
that only 5–10% of cisplatin is bound to DNA, whilst
other nucleophilic molecules such as phospholipids,
cytoskeletal and membrane proteins, and mtDNA are
targeted by the drug, suggesting that other mechanisms
may explain cisplatin toxicity [26, 27]. Unfortunately,
the therapeutic effectiveness of cisplatin is limited by the
onset of cisplatin resistance [7], whose mechanisms are
still not fully understood. Emerging evidence supports the
idea that the deregulated cell metabolism could sustain
drug resistance [28]. In this work we have investigated
the contribution of metabolic reprogramming to cisplatin
resistance and revealed novel metabolic liabilities of
cisplatin-resistant cells.

Our previous research showed that cisplatinresistant ovarian cancer cells (C13) present defective
mitochondrial bioenergetics [12, 20]. By generating
transmitochondrial hybrids [29, 30, 31] we demonstrate
here that the mitochondrial polymorphisms found in C13
cells are not causative of the different mitochondrial asset
previously observed. We also show that C13 mitochondrial
dysfunction is not due to inherent respiratory chain defects
but, rather, by a decrease in mitochondrial biomass. The
increased mitochondrial turnover may be required to clear
dysfunctional mitochondria that accumulate in cancer
cells, and to maintain mitochondrial metabolism, as
recently proposed by Strohecker et al. [32]. In line with
these findings, we observed that the metabolic activity

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of C13 cells measured by incubating cells with [U-13C]
glutamine is even higher than the cisplatin-sensitive
counterpart. Therefore, our results suggest that a high
mitochondrial turnover could compensate for inherent
mitochondrial defects in cisplatin-resistant cells.
We then analyzed other aspects of the metabolic
reprogramming of cisplatin-resistant cells, including
glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and metabolic pathways
involved in redox homeostasis. Cisplatin-resistant cells
exhibited increased glucose uptake, overexpression of the
glucose transporter GLUT1, and increased glutaminolysis,
which make these cells more sensitive to glucose and
glutamine deprivation. It is worth noting that glucose
and glutamine are not mere carbon sources but they also
contribute to the redox homeostasis of these cells. The
activation of antioxidant pathways is now emerging as a
crucial adaptive mechanism involved in drug resistance
and a role for increased GSH biosynthesis has been
proposed to provide resistance to cisplatin [23, 33, 34].
Consistent with this view, we found that glutaminederived glutamate is utilized for GSH biosynthesis in
cisplatin-resistant cells. In support of a metabolic rewiring
of glucose towards antioxidant pathways, we found that
the expression and enzymatic activity of G6PDH, a key
enzyme of the PPP, were elevated in resistant cells as
compared to sensitive cells. Moreover, the combined
treatment with the G6PDH inhibitors 6-AN or DHEA
and cisplatin, showed a selective additive effect on
cisplatin-resistant cells, suggesting that upregulation
of G6PDH activity could be a targetable mechanism of
chemotherapeutic resistance to cisplatin. In leukemia
cells, it has been documented that the acquisition of
daunorubicin resistance is accompanied by elevation
of the oxidative PPP. But adriamycin/doxorubicinresistant MCF-7 cells display reduced G6PDH and PPP
activity compared with sensitive cells, suggesting that a
hyperactive PPP sensitizes cells to anthracyclines [17].
Differently from the contradictory results obtained with
anthracyclines, our data clearly indicate that the PPP
inhibition may be peculiar for cisplatin resistance, offering
a novel synthetic lethality approach. These results are in
line with the concept of induced essentiality, where by
cancer cells become sensitive to the inhibition of the very
same metabolic pathways that evolved as mechanisms of
resistance from chemotherapeutic agents [35, 36].
Taken together our results show that profound
metabolic changes underpin cisplatin resistance. Besides
reduction of mitochondrial mass and overall mitochondrial
function, these cells increase their demand of glucose and
glutamine, which are in part used to maintain the cell’s
antioxidant defenses. Chemotherapy designed to target
metabolic pathways is a new approach, and potentially
more effective to inhibit tumor cell growth [37]. Our work
demonstrated that the combination of cisplatin treatment
with inhibition of the PPP enzyme G6PDH, can remarkably
improve the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and can help to
overcome cancer resistance to cisplatin treatment.

Cell lines
Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (2008 wild
type and C13 cisplatin-resistant cells) were grown in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI 1640)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
4  mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, in humidified condition at 5% CO2 and 37°C.
206-ρ° cells derived from mtDNA depletion of
143B-TK− osteosarcoma cells (kind gift of Andrea
Martinuzzi, IRCSS E. Medea-La Nostra Famiglia

Transmitochondrial cybrid cell lines (H2008 and
HC13) were generated by polyethylene glycol fusion
of enucleated 2008 and C13 with the mtDNA-less (ρ0)
osteosarcoma (143B-TK−) cell line as previously described
[38]. Individual hybrid clones were isolated 10–20 days
later using glass cylinders. Hybrid cell lines were cultured
as previously described [39]. All reagents for cell culture
were from Cambrex-Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and FBS
from Gibco, Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Genome sequences
The entire mitochondrial genome was sequenced
in a series of overlapping fragments using M13-tagged
oligodeoxynucleotide primers to facilitate direct sequencing
of the PCR amplified products with BigDye®terminator
chemistries on an Applied Biosystem 3100 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) [40].
All sequences were directly compared to the revised
Cambridge reference sequence for human mtDNA
(GenBank Accession number NC_012920).

Cell viability assays
Trypan blue exclusion assay
2 × 105 cells (2008-C13) or 1 × 105 cells (H2008HC13) were plated on 6-well plates and, following
overnight incubation, were exposed to different treatments
according to experimental protocols. After treatments,
cells were washed, detached with 0.25% trypsin-0.2%
EDTA and suspended in trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) at 1:1 ratio in medium solution. Cells
were counted using a chamber Burker hemocytometer.
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) test
2.5 × 103 cells were plated on 96-well plates
and, following overnight incubation, were exposed to
different treatments according to experimental protocols.
After treatments cells were fixed to tissue-culture plates
with trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained
for 30  minutes with SRB (Sigma-Aldrich). The bound

(pH = 10.5) and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm
using a Victor3X multilabel plate counter (Wallac

1.5 × 106 cells (2008-C13) were plated in 100 mm
cell culture dish and allowed to attach overnight. After
48 hours, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer
supplemented with the protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The
protein content was determined by Lowry procedure
(Bio-rad DC Protein Assay, MA, USA). Equal amounts
of protein (40 μg) were loaded on a polyacrylamide gel
and electrophoretically separated in running buffer.
After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto an
Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking, the membrane
was exposed to the elected primary antibodies: anti-LC3
(1:1000; Cell Signaling, MA, USA) or anti-G6PD (1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Europe). After washing,
the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:3500; PerkinElmer,
MA,USA). The signal was visualized with enhanced
chemoluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by
Molecular Imager VersaDoc MP 4000 (Bio-rad). LC3 and
G6PD were normalized to beta-actin (1:7000; AbCam,

Annexin V/propidium iodide staining
1 × 105 cells (H2008-HC13) were seeded in 12-well
plates, incubated overnight and treated with cisplatin
(1–10 μM) for 24 hours. Then, cells were harvested by
quick trypsinization and centrifugated at 1200 rpm for
5 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in a binding
buffer containing Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V and
propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and then incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature as previously described [12]. The fluorescence
of stained cells was measured by Epics XL flow cytometer
(Coulter Systems, Fullerton, CA, USA) and analysed
with the EXPO 32 software (Coulter Systems, Fullerton,
CA, USA).

Oxygen consumption
Oxygen consumption was measured in live cells
(3.5  × 106) resuspended in 1 ml glucose-free DMEM
(Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% sodiumpyruvate (Cambrex-Lonza) at 37°C, using a Clark-type
oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, King’s Lynn,
Norfolk, UK). Oxygen consumption was measured using
the software Oxygraph plus v. 1.01. Data processing
includes: fmol/c/min = (RATE/3.5 × 106)*1 million.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total mRNA was isolated as per manufacturer’s
instructions using QIAshredder and RNeasykits (Qiagen,
Venlo, Netherlands) and measured with a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.
Wilmington, DE, USA). 0,5 μg of total mRNA was reversetranscribed to complementary DNA using The High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits of Applied
Biosystem by Life Technologies. The relative expression of
genes of interest was determined by quantitative real-time
PCR (StepOne™ Systems of Applied Biosystem by Life
Technologies) using Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystem by Life Technologies) and the primers
designed as follow: BNIP3: F gaatttctgaaagttttccttcca

R gctggctcggctttaacc; LDHA: F aaaccgtgttattggaagcg,
R agcactctcaaccacctgct. To measure the mRNA level
of G6PDH and mitochondrial biogenesis genes, total
mRNA was isolated with TRIzol (Life Technologies)
as previously described by Chomczynski P and Sacchi
N [42] and measured with a Beckman Coulter DU-800
spectrophotometer. The relative expression of each gene
was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (Eco™
Illumina, Real-Time PCR system, San Diego, CA,
USA) using One Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit
(Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) and the primers
designed as follow: G6PDH: F aagaacgtgaagctccctga

Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ)
and mitochondrial mass
Flow cytometry
2 × 105 cells (2008-C13) or 1 × 105 cells (H2008HC13) were seeded and incubated for 48 hours, washed
with phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS), detached
with 0.25% trypsin-0.2% EDTA and centrifuged for
5 minutes at 1200 rpm. Cells were resuspended with
rhodamine-123 (10 μM) or Acridine Orange 10-Nonyl
bromide NAO  (25  nM) and incubated for 15 minutes.
Probes were from Sigma-Aldrich. Fluorescence intensity
was analyzed using an Epics XL flow cytometer. 104 cells
of interest were analyzed. Mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) values were obtained using the EXPO 32 software.
Live-cells confocal microscopy
2 × 105 cells (2008-C13) or 1 × 105 cells (H2008HC13) were grown in 3.5 cm glass-bottom dishes
(MatTek Corporation, Ashland, USA) and, after 48 hours,
were loaded with 100 nM Mitotracker Green (MTG;
Invitrogen). Cells were imaged using a laser scanner
microscope (Leica TCS SP5, 60X magnification).
A  volumetric reconstruction was then obtained and
analysed using the software Volocity.

PCR amplifications were assessed using standard curves
generated by serial dilution of complementary DNA;
melt-curve analysis was used to confirm the specificity
of amplification and absence of primer dimers. All
genes were normalized to β-actin designed as follow: F
ccaaccgcgagaagatga R ccagaggcgtacagggatag. Expression
levels of the indicated genes were calculated by the ΔΔCt
method using respectively the dedicated StepOne software
or Eco™ Software v4.0.7.0.

Cellular GSH and GSSG content was enzymatically
determined as previously described by Floreani et al.
[44]. 1.5 × 106 cells (2008-C13) were plated in 100
mm cell culture dish and allowed to attach overnight.
After 48 hours, cells were washed with PBS and then
treated with 6% meta-phosphoric acid (MPA). After
10 minutes at room temperature, the acid extract was
collected, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 14000 rpm and
processed. The cellular pellet was solubilized with 0.5 M
potassium hydroxide and assayed for protein content.
For total GSH determination, the above acid extract was
diluted in 6% MPA and added with 0.1 M potassium
phosphate/5 mM EDTAbuffer (pH 7.4), 10 mM 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 5 mM NADPH. After a 3 minute
equilibration period, the reaction was started by adding
2 U GSH reductase (type III; Sigma-Aldrich; from baker’s
yeast; diluted in 0.1 M phosphate/EDTA buffer). Product
formation was recorded continuously at 412 nm with a
Beckman DU800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The total
amount of GSH was determined from a standard curve
obtained by plotting known amounts of GSH against the
rate of change in absorbance. For GSSG measurement,
soon after preparation, the supernatant of acid extract
was treated for derivatization with 2-vinylpyridine and
triethanolamine. The samples were incubated at room
temperature for 60 minutes and then assayed with the same
procedure above described for total GSH measurement.
The GSH concentration of each sample was calculated as
the difference between total glutathione and GSSG. All
reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy
(LC-MS)
2 × 105 cells (2008-C13) were plated in 6-well plates
and after 48 hours quickly washed with ice cold PBS
on an ice bath. The samples were therefore prepared as
previously described [43]. In brief, cells were lysed with a
dry ice/methanol solution (−80°C) of 50% methanol/30%
acetonitrile in water and quickly scraped. The extracts
were mixed at 4°C for 15 minutes and pelleted in a cooled
centrifuge (4°C). The supernatant was collected and
submitted for LC-MS analysis. The amount of extraction
solution was calculated according to the number of cells
present in the sample dish, extrapolated using a “counter
dish” cultured in the same conditions of the sample dishes.
A concentration of 1 ml per 1 × 106 cells was used in the
extraction solutions.
Intermediates were separated using a liquid
chromatography system. Data acquisition was controlled
with Xcalibur 2.0 (ThermoElectron Co, San Jose, CA,
USA). The mass accuracy was maintained below 1 ppm
due to use of a lock mass. The raw chromatograms
were then aligned using the software SIEVE™
(ThermoElectron). The integration of the measured ion
current over a metabolite’s elution time and m/z interval
is directly proportional to its absolute abundance in
the solution. We manually removed from the SIEVE’s
output unspecific and misaligned peaks to eliminate
the noise.

G6PDH activity
1.5 × 106 cells (2008-C13) were plated in 100 mm
cell culture dish and allowed to attach overnight. After
48 hours, cells were washed with PBS and quickly scraped.
2.5 × 106 of cells were then collected by centrifugation
and sonicated on ice. The G6PDH activity was assayed
on cell supernatant as per manufacturer’s instructions
using the Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity
Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Company, MI, USA). The
fluorescence intensity (λex/em = 540/585) was measured
using a Victor3X multilabel plate counter (Wallac
Instruments). The G6PDH activity (nmol/min/ml) was
calculated as per manufacturer’s instructions.

Glucose uptake
5 × 103 cells (2008-C13) were plated in 96-well
plate and allowed to attach overnight. After 24 hours,
glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells with
90 μM glucose analogue 6-NBDG (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK) for 1 minute. Cells where then washed, added with
PBS and their fluorescence (λex: 465 nm, λem: 540nm)
was measured by Victor3X multilabel plate counter
(Wallac Instruments).

Isobolographic analysis

resistance: preclinical findings and clinical implications.
Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 2010; 1806:172–82.

Isobolographic analysis was used to determine
the effect of the combination between cisplatin and the
G6PDH inhibitor 6-AN or DHEA. Isoboles are defined as
iso-effect curves that show drug concentrations resulting
in equal effect [45, 46]. From iso-effective curves it
is possible to verify the presence of simple additivity,
supra-additivity (synergism, i.e. when drug combination
produces an effect greater than that predictable from
each drug alone) or infra-additivity (antagonism).
Isobolographic analysis was possible only for C13
and A431pt data; in 2008 cells the predominant effect
produced by cisplatin hindered the overall effect.
