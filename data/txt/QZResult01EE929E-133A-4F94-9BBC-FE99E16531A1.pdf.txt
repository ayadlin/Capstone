Abstract
We previously demonstrated that non-toxic doses of Celecoxib induced the
immediate phosphorylation of Erk1-2 in colon tumor associated fibroblasts (TAFs),
increasing their responsiveness to epidermal growth factor (EGF). We have now
identified two concomitant mechanisms explaining the EGF-Celecoxib cooperation.
We found that a 24-48h Celecoxib priming increased EGF receptor (EGFR) mRNA and
protein levels in colon TAFs, promoting EGF binding and internalization. Celecoxibprimed TAFs showed a reduced EGFR degradation after EGF challenge. This delay
corresponded to a deferred dissociation of EEA1 from EGFR positive endosomes and
the accumulation of Rab7, pro Cathepsin-D and SQSTM1/p62, suggesting a shared
bottleneck in the pathways of late-endosomes/autophagosomes maturation. Celecoxib
modulated the levels of target proteins similarly to the inhibitors of endosome/
lysosome acidification Bafilomycin-A1 and NH4Cl. Cytoplasmic vesicles fractionation
showed a reduced maturation of Cathepsin-D in late endosomes and an increased
content of EGFR and Rab7 in lysosomes of Celecoxib-treated TAFs.
Our data indicate a double mechanism mediating the increased response to EGF
of colon TAFs treated with Celecoxib. While EGFR overexpression could be targeted
using anti EGFR drugs, the effects on endosome trafficking and protein turnover
represents a more elusive target and should be taken into account for any long-term
therapy with Celecoxib.

INTRODUCTION

component of the tumor mass, but could be the first target
of any drug, coming from the blood stream or the cell
interstice. Anticancer drugs would challenge TAFs before
reaching the neoplastic cell and TAFs could react to the
drug, thus altering the microenvironment to limit epithelial
damage [7, 8]. For this reason TAFs should be evaluated
as drug targets.
Human colon is the body district more exposed
to non-self antigens, due to the huge colonization by
microbiota [9]. Alterations of gut microbiome can
cause acute inflammatory responses and participate to
chronic pathologies like inflammatory bowel disease,
ulcerative colitis and colon cancer [10]. An abundant
literature indicates inflammation as one of the leading
causes of colon cancer and numerous clinical trials

Colon cancer is a slow developing tumor
progressively altering tissue architecture. At all stages
of tumor progression, colon TAFs almost invariably
accompany and envelope epithelial cells, lining tubular
crypts in well differentiated, early tumors or surrounding
adenomatous crypts in advanced tumors [1-3]. The
invasive front of advanced adenocarcinomas is also
enriched in TAFs, taking an active part to tissue invasion
as main producers of matrix metalloproteinases [4, 5]. The
presence of an abundant TAF infiltration, at the invasive
front of colon tumors, also predicts a reduced patient
survival [6]. According to these observations, colon
TAFs are not only an active and potentially malignant

signaling without affecting EGFR phosphorylation, but
increasing Erk1-2 activity. EGFR or Erk1-2 inhibitors
were able to inhibit the Celecoxib + EGF synergy, thus
blocking TAFs proliferation. We also found that the
kinetic of Erk1-2 activation by Celecoxib was bimodal
with a strong and transient early response, followed
after 24h, by a lower and constitutive reactivation. These
findings suggested two distinct mechanisms mediating
the synergy of Celecoxib with EGF: the first one direct
and the other mediated by gene expression. Here we
further investigated the synergy between Celecoxib and
EGF-mediated signaling in TAFs, focusing on EGFR.
Celecoxib increased total EGFR levels in colon TAFs
by both inducing EGFR neosynthesis and by slowing
down EGF-triggered EGFR degradation. The latter effect
was apparently mediated by a retarded maturation of
the late endo-lysosomal degradative compartment. As a
consequence of this altered vesicle maturation, Celecoxib
could modulate not only the amount of EGFR, but also the
intracellular levels of other proteins degraded through the
same pathway. This might alter the functional behavior of
colon TAFs and trigger unpredictable responses to external
stimuli such as the drugs used in colon cancer therapy.

have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs effectively
reduce colon tumor incidence [11]. Prostaglandinendoperoxide synthases/cyclooxygenases (PTGS/COX)
are the rate-limiting enzymes in prostaglandin (PG)
and thromboxane neosynthesis [12]. While COX-1 is
constitutively expressed in several organs, with an autolimited biological activity (self-inactivation during the
reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 [13]), COX-2 can be rapidly
induced by mitogens and inflammatory stimuli [14].
COX-2 is frequently upregulated in colon cancer and is
considered a prototypical target for chemoprevention [15].
Among specific COX-2 inhibitors, Celecoxib showed a
powerful chemopreventive activity both against familiar
and sporadic colon tumors [16, 17], though its long-term
administration caused paradoxical effects both in mouse
models [18, 19], activating gut fibroblasts, and in patients
discontinuing the treatment [20], increasing adenoma
occurrence.
EGFR is the prototype of the erb-B receptors family
and the only one necessary for the correct development
of the gut in transgenic knock-out mice [21, 22]. Many
epithelial tumors rely on the activation of EGFR and in
colorectal cancer EGFR gene amplification predicts a
better response to the anti EGFR antibody therapy with
Cetuximab [23]. EGFR levels are modulated not only
by gene transcription, but also by its ligands. HB-EGF,
Betacellulin and EGF induce a powerful short-term
signaling, targeting EGFR for lysosomal degradation,
while TGF-alpha, Epiregulin and Amphiregulin trigger
a minor, but constant signaling by receptor recycling
[24]. The activation and trafficking of EGFR, upon EGF
binding, has been deeply investigated. EGF does not
directly trigger EGFR dimerization, as observed for other
growth factors, but induces a conformational change of
the single receptor favoring dimerization. Both homo and
heterodimers with other erb-B receptors can be formed.
Dimerization induces the phosphorylation of multiple
aminoacidic residues at the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail,
activating several signaling pathways [22, 25]. Soon
after activation, EGFR dimers are transferred to the
early endosomes, that aggregate into larger vesicles by
the concerted activity of the Early Endosome Antigen 1
(EEA1) and Ras-related GTP binding protein 5 (Rab5)
[26]. Large endosomes mature by loosing Rab5 and EEA1,
and acquiring Rab7, the GTPase that drives endosomelysosome fusion [27, 28]. Of note, EGFR signaling is
active unless large multivesicular bodies/late endosomes
are formed and eventually fused with lysosomes [29, 30].
Targeting EGFR to degradation without activation is the
therapeutic goal of Cetuximab, being the disturbance
of internalization/degradation a major mechanism for
acquired resistance to this drug [31].
Previously, we characterized the effects of Celecoxib
on human colon TAFs showing that nontoxic doses (up
to 25μM) were able to increase colon TAFs proliferation
in the presence of EGF [32]. Celecoxib sustained EGF

RESULTS
Celecoxib activates colon TAFs and increases
EGF-triggered responses
We previously showed that colon TAFs exhibit
a great tolerance to Celecoxib treatment. Moreover,
Celecoxib at nontoxic concentration activated colon TAFs
signaling, causing a rapid and transient phosphorylation
of Erk1-2 [32]. This activation was able to synergize with
low dose EGF (1ng/ml). In this study we first assessed
whether Celecoxib could affect TAFs growth also in
the presence of the high dose EGF, used here (Fig.
1a). Celecoxib induced a negligible effect per se, but it
consistently increased the EGF-mediated triggering of
TAFs growth. To analyze whether Celecoxib could affect
TAFs adhesive properties, a feature of TAFs activation, we
assessed binding of TAFs to collagen (Fig. 1b). Of note,
Celecoxib alone increased TAFs adhesion to collagen as
compared to untreated cells. More importantly, Celecoxib
potentiated EGF-mediated adhesion to collagen. This
effect was associated with a more intense activation of
Erk1-2 phosphorylation induced by Celecoxib and EGF
together, than that induced by EGF alone. On the other
hand, Akt phosphorylation consequent to EGF signaling
was poorly affected by Celecoxib (Fig. 1c and 1d).

Celecoxib increases EGFR mRNA and protein
expression in colon TAFs

EGFR degradation upon EGF triggering. Challenging
colon TAFs with EGF (Fig. 3a), we noticed the
appearance of low molecular weight bands indicating
EGFR degradation at 60min and 90min, becoming more
evident at 120min. Interestingly, in the cells pretreated
with Celecoxib EGFR degradation was increased during
the first hour of triggering, but delayed at 90 and even
more at 120min. To track EGFR along its degradative
route we needed an endosomal marker whose levels were
not modulated by Celecoxib. We found that the early
endosome marker 1 (EEA1) satisfied this condition (Fig.
3b), thus EEA1 was used for co-localization studies with
EGFR. By double immunofluorescence and microscopic
evaluation, we analyzed the overlap for EGFR and EEA1
signals in colon TAFs. The representative images shown
in Fig. 3c (90min of incubation with EGF) indicated that
most EGFR staining localized in EEA1 positive vesicles.
Calculating Mander’s coefficients for EEA1 and EGFR
co-localization (Fig. 3d) it was evident that EGFR colocalization with EEA1 increased over time and it was
unaffected by Celecoxib (left panel). This observation
confirmed the unaltered internalization of the receptor
upon EGF binding. On the contrary EEA1 dissociated
from EGFR less efficiently in the presence of Celecoxib
(right panel).
Flow cytometry analyses of total EGFR levels in
the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3e), showed that
the delayed dissociation of EEA1 from EGFR-positive
endosomes was associated with a reduced degradation
of EGFR in Celecoxib-treated samples as compared to
controls, despite a progressive loss of the receptor over
time in both conditions.

Previously, we observed that long-term pretreatment
of colon TAFs with Celecoxib apparently caused EGFR
upregulation. To define whether Celecoxib could modify
EGFR mRNA levels, Real Time PCR analysis was
performed. As shown in Figure 2a, EGF increased the
expression of its receptor in colon TAFs, and Celecoxib
approximately doubled EGFR mRNA both in untreated,
or EGF-treated TAFs. At protein level (Fig. 2b, 2c), EGF
caused a massive degradation of its receptor after an
overnight incubation. Celecoxib increased EGFR levels
either in controls and, with higher efficiency, in EGFtreated TAFs. The EGFR-inducing activity of Celecoxib
was not confined to colon TAFs, as also normal fibroblasts
from colon mucosa and some CRC cell lines showed
similar results, with some exceptions (supplementary Fig.
1S).
To confirm western blot findings, colon TAFs
were analyzed in the same experimental settings by flow
cytometry, for quantification of surface-expressed and total
EGFR. Under chronic Celecoxib regimen alone, a modest
increase of total EGFR was detectable by this method
(Fig. 2d, upper row of histograms). EGF chronic treatment
induced internalization and degradation of EGFR with the
consequent decrease of both surface and total EGFR levels
(Fig. 2d, middle row). In the presence of EGF, Celecoxib
caused a strong rescue of EGFR, clearly evident for total
EGFR, and proportionally identical for the surface-bound
EGFR fraction (Fig. 2d, lower row). The mean of three
distinct experiments on two different TAFs primary cell
cultures showed an almost constant 1,6 fold increase of
EGFR in the presence of Celecoxib under EGF chronic
treatment, both as surface- expressed or total protein
level (Fig. 2e). Celecoxib-triggered increase of EGFR
protein levels, found under EGF treatment, was higher
as compared to the effect of Celecoxib alone in controls.
This gain could be driven by an impaired interaction of
EGF with its receptor, or by a limited internalization of
their complex. For this reason we performed binding and
internalization assays using biotinylated EGF. We found
that Celecoxib-induced increase of EGFR protein was
coupled to an improved ability of colon TAFs to bind
and internalize EGF, excluding any direct influence of
Celecoxib on EGF-EGFR interaction (Fig. 2f).

Celecoxib alters protein turnover
The main cellular routes for protein degradation are
the proteasome [33], a protein complex directly acting on
cytoplasmic proteins, and the lysosome [34], a vesicledelimited compartment collecting both extracellular
and membrane bound proteins (by endosomes), and
cytoplasmic proteins (by autophagosomes). These
pathways are partially interdependent and cooperate
to determine the correct turnover of several proteins.
EGF-induced EGFR degradation is both proteasomeand lysosome-dependent [35-37]. Thus, we looked for
a marker protein modulated by both proteasome and
lysosome activity, suitable as a shared sensor for these
pathways. p62/SQSTM1 is an ubiquitin binding protein
triggering protein and organelles degradation through
autophagy [38]. P62 is incremented upon proteasome or
lysosome inhibition [39, 40], we then decided to evaluate
its levels in our experimental system. Western blot analysis
(Fig. 4a) showed a striking accumulation of p62 protein
in the presence of Celecoxib. P62 was poorly affected by
EGF triggering. Double immunofluorescence of p62 and
EGFR showed a low number of active autophagosomes

Celecoxib delays EGFR degradation
The increase of EGFR induced by Celecoxib was
more evident in the presence of an elevated turnover
triggered by EGF, suggesting the coexistence of different
mechanisms modulating EGFR kinetic other than the
induction of EGFR mRNA transcript.
We tested if Celecoxib could alter the kinetic of

per cell (Fig. 2S a), with very rare single cells showing
high number of p62 positive vesicles. P62 and EGFR
showed a reduced co-localization in colon TAFs primed
with EGF even in the presence of Celecoxib (Fig. 2S b).
This observation indicated a marginal participation of
p62 and autophagy to EGFR degradation in our model.
Accordingly, we could hypothesize that EGFR and
p62 were independently subdued to the same effect of
Celecoxib on protein turnover.
To further investigate the activity of Celecoxib on
protein degradation pathways, we compared Celecoxib
with inhibitors targeting the proteasome (MG132),
endosome acidification by inhibition of the vacuolar
type H+/ATPase or V-ATPase (Bafilomycin-A1) and
neutralization of lysosomal pH (NH4Cl). EGFR, p62,
HSP70 and IkBα were used as protein targets (Fig.
4b). HSP70 and IkBα were selected as known targets
for proteasome-mediated degradation [41, 42]. We
observed that Celecoxib increased EGFR and p62 levels
(quantified in Fig. 4c), leaving unaffected HSP70 and
apparently lowering IkBα. MG132 increased all these
marker proteins. Bafilomycin-A1 and NH4Cl displayed
a similar behavior as compared to Celecoxib. Further, as
expected, only EGFR was substantially lowered by EGF
treatment. These findings suggested that Celecoxib could
affect endosome maturation by influencing vesicular
acidification. Thus, we quantified the pH variations
induced by Celecoxib using the Lysosensor-Green DND189 probe; unfortunately, Lysosensor-Green stained
TAFs cytoplasm, giving an excessive background noise
at any concentration tested, rendering inadequate this
experimental approach (not shown).
We then decided to analyze markers of endocytic
vesicles involved in protein turnover. In these experiments
we lowered Bafilomycin-A1 and NH4Cl concentrations
to obtain an increase of EGFR levels comparable to that
achieved with Celecoxib. We also limited EGF triggering
(3h) to maximize the effects on EGFR degradation,
reducing the contribution of its neosynthesis (Fig. 4d).
The inhibitors modulated EGFR and p62 levels coherently
with the previous experiments (Fig. 4e). The analysis
of endocellular vesicles markers showed stable EEA1
(early endosome) and LAMP1 (late endosome/lysosome)
levels. On the contrary, the late endosome marker Rab7
was particularly increased in the presence of Celecoxib
and Bafilomycin-A1, showing a modulation similar to
EGFR (Fig. 4e, bottom-left panel). This modulation
was suggestive of a delay in late endosomes maturation
possibly causing their accumulation and a retarded fusion
with lysosomes [27, 30], and accounting for impaired
EGFR degradation. Rab7-enriched late endosomes tend
to cluster favoring homotypic tethering that lowers the
efficiency of movement and delivery of cargo molecules
from multivesicular bodies (MVB) to lysosomes [43]. To
further explore this hypothesis, we evaluated pro- and
active Cathepsin-D levels. Cathepsin-D is an aspartic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protease that accumulates in endosomes/phagosomes as an
immature pro-peptide and is activated by acidic enzymes
at low pH [44, 45], so it can be used as an indirect marker
of endosome maturation and acidification. We found
that Celecoxib, Bafilomycin-A1 and NH4Cl induced an
EGF independent increase of pro-Cathepsin-D (Fig. 4e
upper-right panel). While Bafilomycin-A1 caused an
evident switch in favor of pro Cathepsin-D, lowering the
processing to active Cathepsin-D (Fig. 4e middle and
bottom-right panel), Celecoxib and NH4Cl apparently
caused an increment of the pro-enzyme without lowering
its active form.

Celecoxib retards pro Cathepsin-D activation in
late endosomes
The data on Rab7 and Cathepsin-D obtained with
drugs contrasting endo-lysosomal acidification, suggested
that Celecoxib could retard EGFR degradation by the
same mechanism, causing a delay in pro Cathepsin-D
cleavage. As this was not evident in whole cell lysates, we
purified fractions of cytoplasmic vesicles enriched in early
endosomes (EE), late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes
(Lys) to verify the levels of EGFR, Rab7 and pro/active
Cathepsin-D in each compartment (Fig. 5a). In all
experimental conditions the main quote of EGFR localized
in LE (Fig. 5b), followed by Lys. In these compartments
the increment induced by Celecoxib was more evident as
compared to EE. Rab7 correctly localized in LE and Lys
(Fig. 5c), Celecoxib was active on both compartments
increasing Rab7 levels especially in the lysosome
-enriched fraction, as compared to relative controls. When
we analyzed the levels of pro and active Cathepsin-D
(Fig. 5d, 5e), we found most of the enzyme correctly
localized in Lys and LE-enriched fractions. In LE we
observed that Celecoxib lowered the levels of the active
enzyme as compared to controls, while pro Cathepsin-D
was increased, confirming a block of its maturation. To
summarize these observations, we calculated the ratios
of Celecoxib-treated samples against the relative controls
(both untreated or EGF-treated, Fig. 5f). This graphical
representation made evident that, in the absence of EGF,
the accumulation of immature Cathepsin-D in LE was
accompanied by a robust increase of Rab7 and intact
EGFR in the Lys-enriched fraction of Celecoxib-treated
TAFs. The chronic presence of high dose EGF was able
to unclog vesicle trafficking and EGFR degradation,
though the retard in Cathepsin-D maturation in LE was
maintained by Celecoxib, and both EGFR and Rab7 levels
exceeded controls.

DISCUSSION
Despite the advances in early diagnosis and
therapy, colorectal cancer remains a big killer among
12317

solid tumors, with only 50% of patients reaching a
5-year survival after curative surgery. The therapeutic
protocols based on 5-fluorouracil and platinum have not
been significantly implemented during the last five years,
while targeted therapy with biological agents is applied

with high costs and marginal effects against the metastatic
disease [11]. A possible way to circumvent these biases
is chemoprevention. As sporadic colon cancer is a slow
developing tumor of the elderly, chemoprevention
could radically change its incidence and natural history,

possibly delaying the occurrence of aggressive tumors to
an age that exceeds natural death. A well-defined target
of chemoprevention is COX-2, an enzyme induced by
inflammation, hypoxia and stress signals. COX-2 catalyzes
the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) neo
synthesis and has been extensively linked to colon cancer
[46]. COX-2 expression regulation is extremely complex
and its direct linkage to colon cancer aggressiveness
in late stages is not definitely proven [47, 48], though
several NSAIDS, such as aspirin and Celecoxib, have
shown strong chemopreventive effects on colon tumors
[16, 17, 49-51]. While the side effects of these drugs have
temporary biased their extended use in chronic regimens,
the recent finding of a correlation between PIK3CA
mutation in colon tumors and an increased survival of
patients under long-term aspirin therapy at diagnosis
[52], indicates the need for specific markers identifying
responders to NSAIDS regimen.
Celecoxib has been extensively tested in vitro on
colon cancer cell lines, showing both COX-2 dependent
and independent effects [53-55]. While these observations
are useful in the context of advanced cancer models, they
do not reflect the pathophysiology of normal mucosa and
early adenomas, where COX-2 is mainly expressed in the
stroma [56-60]. In the min-/+ mouse model continued longterm Celecoxib regimen caused an initial regression of
intestinal tumors, but finally the incidence was comparable
to untreated controls [19]. This failure of chemoprevention
was accompanied by a strong activation of gut fibroblasts
and tissue fibrosis [18, 61]. We thus decided to test
Celecoxib on primary human colon TAFs, identifying a
strong activation of Erk1-2 and a powerful synergy with
EGF [32].
EGFR is deregulated in most epithelial tumors [62].
In colorectal cancer EGFR is rarely mutated, while gene
amplification is more frequent and associates to a better
response to anti EGFR monoclonal antibodies [23, 63,
64]. Both colon tumor epithelial cells and TAFs share
EGFR expression. In our hands, colon TAFs were more
responsive to EGF as compared to bFGF [32] suggesting
that, in the presence of an anti EGFR therapy, they
could be efficiently targeted. Indeed, we reported that
both Cetuximab and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Thyrphostin were able to inhibit the Celecoxib + EGF
synergy. Despite the evident amplifying effect exerted by
Celecoxib on EGF activity, we were unable to characterize
a direct influence of Celecoxib on EGFR phosphorylation
[32].
In the present study, we show that a long-term
treatment with Celecoxib is able to increase the levels
of total EGFR in colon TAFs. This increment could
explain the synergy of Celecoxib with EGF that results
particularly evident when colon TAFs are exposed to
EGFR triggering. The gain in EGFR caused by Celecoxib
under EGF treatment is not only mediated by an active
transcription of the receptor, but it is also accompanied by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a retarded degradation.
EGFR has been extensively studied as a prototype
of growth factor receptor activation and trafficking [65].
EGFR, upon EGF binding, forms active dimers with
multiple phosphorylated residues at the cytoplasmic
carboxyl tail [25]. These residues act as docking stations
that activate several signaling pathways. Phosphotyrosine
1045 in particular recruits cbl, triggering the ubiquitination
of EGFR and its sorting to lysosomes for degradation [66].
EGFR can be internalized by both a clathrin-dependent or
independent route. The former is usually activated by low
concentrations of EGF and allows for receptor recycling,
the latter is triggered by high EGF concentrations (our
experimental condition) and drives EGFR to degradation
[67, 68]. Endocytosed vesicles fuse to early endosomes
where EGFR continues to signal by its carboxyl-terminal
tale facing the cytoplasm. While the pH of endosomes is
progressively lowered by V-ATPase, the receptor does
not dissociate from EGF, due to the high affinity of their
binding [24]. The signaling of EGFR is stopped only in
the MVBs of the late endosomal compartment, where the
receptor is separated from the cytoplasm [29]. Finally, the
fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes mediated by the
small GTPase Rab7, causes the complete degradation of
EGFR and its ligand [30].
According to our results, Celecoxib can affect
different steps of this pathway. The neo-synthetic
increase of total EGFR can favor EGF binding and
receptor activation, causing an initial empowerment of
internalization and signaling (Fig. 1c, 1d, Fig. 2f and Fig.
3a at 30’). This early increased signal has been shown to
cause a negative feedback, switching off EGFR signaling
[69] and enhancing EGFR degradation [67], however
this was not observed in our experimental model. On the
contrary, the panels a and e of Figure 3 show a retarded
degradation of EGFR in the presence of Celecoxib. At the
same time, the immunofluorescence analysis indicates
a persistent co-localization of EEA1 with EGFR in the
medium-large endosomes of Celecoxib-treated TAFs, as
compared to controls. The delayed negativization of EEA1
in EGFR-positive endosomes suggests a lag in endosomes
maturation, while the linear increase of EGFR colocalizing with EEA1 indicates that EGFR internalization
is not negatively affected by Celecoxib pretreatment,
as also confirmed by binding and internalization assays
showing an increased activity of the receptor (Fig.2f).
The retarded degradation of EGFR is particularly evident
between 90 and 180min from EGF triggering, suggesting
that Celecoxib could influence the maturation in terms
of pH acidification and progression toward lysosome
fusion of late endosomes. This hypothesis is sustained
by the enrichment of Rab7, pro Cathepsin-D and p62
in Celecoxib-pretreated samples. The accumulation of
Rab7 positive endosomes suggests an impaired fusion
with lysosomes [27], accompanied by pro Cathepsin-D
rise, an enzyme typically activated by low pH [44, 45].

materials and METHODS

Autophagosomes share with endosomes the enrichment
in Rab7 and Cathepsin-D during maturation [70, 71].
The increase of the sequestosome-1 protein p62, that
participates to the formation of autophagosomes [39],
suggests that the inhibitory activity of Celecoxib can
be exerted at a late step of endosomes/autophagosomes
maturation, sharing Rab7 and Cathepsin-D enrichment.
We also observed that the V-ATPase inhibitor
Bafilomycin-A1 and the lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl mimic
Celecoxib activity modulating the levels of several marker
proteins. Further, using cytoplasmic vesicle fractionation
and pro/active-Cathepsin-D levels as sensors of pH
decrease, we showed that, in late endosomes, Celecoxib
retarded Cathepsin-D activation. This retard was paired
by the accumulation of Rab7 and intact EGFR in the
lysosomes-enriched fraction of Celecoxib-treated TAFs.
These findings suggested that Celecoxib could affect the
maturation of late endosomes/autophagosomes contrasting
the lowering of pH in these vesicles and/or in lysosomes.
Since the acidification/maturation of endosomes relies
not only on the H+ influx triggered by V-ATPase, but also
on the contemporary associated mobilization of chloride,
sodium, potassium and calcium ions, Celecoxib could also
exert its activity as a known inhibitor of several cationic
channels [72, 73].
Our data show that, in colon carcinoma TAFs,
chronic Celecoxib treatment exerts a complex control
on EGFR levels, activity and turnover. This modulation
determines an amplified EGF binding, internalization and
signaling, inducing both short (i.e. adhesion) and long-term
(i.e. proliferation) biologically relevant responses in colon
TAFs. This information should be taken into consideration
for any therapeutic regimen involving chronic Celecoxib
administration, especially when the upregulation of EGFR
could be detrimental. Yet, the use of Celecoxib should
be carefully evaluated in those therapeutic regimens
including EGFR inhibitors. In our previous work we
showed that the EGFR tyrosine kinase (tyr-k) inhibitor
Tyrphostin blocked the EGF+Celecoxib synergy more
efficiently than Cetuximab [32]. As Cetuximab activity is
mainly mediated by EGFR internalization and degradation
[31], Celecoxib could lower the efficiency of this process,
while tyr-k inhibition would be unaffected. Another way
Celecoxib could alter Cetuximab efficacy is through the
increased expression of EGFR on colon TAFs: in vivo,
tumor stroma wrapping epithelial cancer cells could
sequester and lower the levels of drug available for cancer
targeting. Last but not least, Celecoxib prescription for
pain relief in arthrosis could condition EGFR levels in the
intestine of elderly patients already affected by different
gut pathologies, possibly influencing the course of the
disease and therapy. While these hypotheses need further
investigations, the “Celecoxib lesson” indicates the need
for a detailed identification of the off-target effects of new
COX-2 inhibitors based on a similar chemical scaffold.

TAFs and CRC cell lines
MF1T, MF2T and MF3T primary human colon
TAFs cell cultures from colon adenocarcinomas were
previously described [32]. Most of the assays showed in
this study were performed on MF2T, and were confirmed
with MF1T and MF3T TAFs. MF2N (MAF), derived from
normal colon mucosa, were used as an additional control
in Fig. 1S. The colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines CaCo2
and HT29 (COX-2 positive), HCT15 and SW480 (COX-2
negative) were cultured in DMEM 10% FCS. CaCo2 were
also differentiated by long-term confluent in vitro culture
[74]. CRC cell lines, except for differentiated CaCo2, were
tested at low confluence, in the same conditions described
for TAFs.
TAFs, at passage 4 of in vitro culture, were plated in
DMEM 10% FCS and let to adhere for 24h-48h. Before
any assay, except for growth assays, TAFs were serumstarved in RPMI with 25mM Hepes buffer (SFM = serum
free medium) for 24h to reduce basal signaling. After
starvation, SFM was changed and TAFs were treated with
Celecoxib (Alexis, 10 μM) for 24 - 48h. TAFs were treated
with EGF (Peprotech, 50ng/ml) for the indicated times.

Cell growth assay
The assay was run as described previously [32].
Briefly, TAFs (4,000 cells/well) were plated in 96 well
plates (Nunc) in RPMI 25mM HEPES containing 1%
FCS. The presence of FCS was necessary to avoid TAFs
layers contraction and detachment along the 7 days
culture of the assay. Two hours after plating, TAFs were
treated with Celecoxib, EGF or both. Growth assay was
stopped using crystal violet fixing-staining solution (4%
paraformaldehyde, 30% ETOH, 60mM NaCl, 5g/l crystal
violet in H2O). Staining was eluted (50% ETOH, 0.1%
CH3COOH in H2O) and quantified by a spectrophotometer
at 595nm (VersaMax, Molecular Devices).

Cell adhesion assay
TAFs adhesion was assessed in 96-wells plates
(Nunc), not treated for cell culture and coated with type
IV collagen (Sigma, 5μg/ml in H2O 0.1% CH3COOH).
TAFs were primed or not with Celecoxib in SFM for 24h
in the tissue culture flask and plated in the adhesion plate
with or without EGF (10,000 cells/well, four replicates
for experimental point) for 30min. At the end of the
incubation TAFs were washed with PBS and fixed/stained
with crystal violet fixing-staining solution. Eluted staining
was quantified by spectrophotometry (595nm).

Real time PCR

Flow cytometry

Total RNAs were obtained from colon TAFs
pretreated or not with Celecoxib for 48h with/without
EGF (50ng/ml, added 16h before stopping the test).
RNAs were extracted and reverse transcribed with
oligo(dT) primers as described [32]; EGFR mRNA
expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time
reverse transcription-PCR by using the following
primers: sense 5′- ACTGCTGCCACAACCAGTG
and
antisense
5′-GGCTTCGTCTCGGAATTTG.
The relative expression of EGFR was assessed in
comparison with the housekeeping gene RNAP2 (RNA
polymerase 2) amplified with the following primers:
sense 5′-GACAATGCAGAGAAGCTGG and antisense
5′-GCAGGAAGACATCATCATCC. cDNAs amplification
and relative expression values were obtained as described
[75].

Colon TAFs were pretreated in the same conditions
described for Real Time PCR and western blot (Figure
2), or immunofluorescence (Figure 3). At the end of
incubation, TAFs were harvested with trypsin, pelleted and
immediately resuspended/fixed in PBS 1% PAF (10 min,
4°C). For intracytoplasmic EGFR evaluation an aliquot
of each cell sample was permeabilized with Triton-X 100
(0.1% final concentration, 10 min, 4°C). Surface EGFR
was detected using Cetuximab (2 μg/ml) as primary
antibody followed by a goat anti-human immunoglobulin
antiserum conjugated with AlexaFluor-647 fluorochrome
(Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) as secondary
antibody. Total EGFR in permeabilized TAFs was detected
by direct staining with anti EGFR-AlexaFluor-647 rabbit
mAb (Cell Signaling), targeting an intracellular domain
of the receptor not influenced by EGF binding. The
intracellular staining with Cetuximab was also run in
parallel as an additional control. Samples were run on
a CyAn ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and at
least 5000 events for each sample were analyzed with
the Summit v4.3software. A relative quantification of
EGFR expression was obtained calculating the ratio of
MFI between each Celecoxib and/or EGF treated sample,
and the untreated control. Negative controls were always
below the first Log of expression and were not plotted in
the figures.

Western blot
Cell lysates of colon TAFs, pretreated or not with
Celecoxib (or MG132, Bafilomycin-A1, NH4Cl) for 48h
with/without EGF (50ng/ml, added 16h before stopping
the test), were obtained in RIPA buffer, resolved (1520 μg/lane) on 10% SDS PAGE precast gels (Thermo
Scientific) and blotted on PVDF membranes (GEhealthcare). Primary antibodies: anti p-Akt (ser473),
p-Erk1-2 (thr202/tyr204), EGFR (D38B1), IkBα were
from Cell Signaling Technology; anti EGFR (sc-03), p62/
SQSTM1 (D3), HSP70 (3A3), Rab7 (H50) were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti EEA1 (14-EEA1, BD
Biosciences); anti LAMP1 (H4A3, Developmental Studies
Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA); anti
Cathepsin-D (Calbiochem). HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used according to the
manufacturer instructions and protein bands were detected
by chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Immobilon Western,
Millipore) and Hyper film-ECL (GE-healthcare). Anti
beta-actin (HRP-conjugated, Cell Signaling Technology)
was used as loading control. MG132 and Bafilomycin-A1
were from Sigma. Densitometric quantification of bands
was obtained by Image-J (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/
download.html). For statistical analysis and graphical
representation of multiple western blot (WB) experiments,
each data set was normalized against the sum of all data
points in a replicate according to Degasperi et al. [76]. In
Figure 2c and 4 c, 4e untreated controls were set to 1, to
get an immediate representation of fold variations of the
other data. Results were plotted as mean+/- s.e.

Binding/internalization
EGF binding and internalization assays were run
in parallel and measured by a non-radioactive method
[77], based on biotin-EGF (Invitrogen). Colon TAFs were
plated in two 96-wells plates (20000/well); after 48h cells
were switched to SFM for 24h and successively incubated
for additional 24h in the presence/absence of Celecoxib.
At the end of incubation TAFs were washed twice with
cold PBS (with Ca++ and Mg++) and incubated with 50ng/
ml biotin-EGF in SFM (4°C, 45min for binding and
37°C, 30min for internalization). The plate used for the
internalization test was then incubated in acidic buffer,
pH 3, to eliminate residual membrane-bound EGF. After
two consecutive washings with cold PBS, TAFs were fixed
and permeabilized. Residual binding sites were blocked by
two consecutive incubations with glycine 50mM in PBS
and Gelatin 2% + Tween20 0.05% in PBS. Biotin EGF
was revealed by incubation with streptavidin-HRP (Life
Technologies) 1:15.000 dilution. After extensive washings,
TAFs were incubated with the Substrate Reagent Pack
DY999 (R&D) and then blocked with DY994 stop
solution. Gemini VersaMax spectrophotometer was used
to quantify the staining at 450nm. Each experimental point
was run in six replicates and data were normalized against
controls processed in parallel, either in the absence of

on 10% Tris-glycine gels. Each enriched fraction was
verified by the relative levels of EEA1, Rab7, LAMP1 and

TAFs, or with TAFs without biotin-EGF incubation.

Immunofluorescence and image analysis
Colon TAFs were plated on 20mm diameter glass
coverslips (100000/35mm petri dish, in 3ml DMEM 10%
FCS). After 3 days TAFs were switched to SFM, 24h later
they were treated or not with Celecoxib for 48h. EGF was
then added to TAFs and cells were incubated for 30, 90,
180min or 16h at 37°C. TAFs were fixed in PAF 4% for
20min at room temperature and blocked/permeabilized
in PBS 5%FCS, 1%BSA, 0.3%Triton-X 100. TAFs were
incubated with anti EGFR (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, 1:500) and anti EEA1 (mouse IgG1, BD,
1:5000) antibodies in PBS 1%BSA, 0.3%Triton-X 100,
4°C overnight. Anti-mouse IgG1 AlexaFluor-488 (1μg/
ml) and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-594 (2 μg/ml) were used
as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI. Fluorescent images were acquired, with fixed
exposition, by a Leica DM-LB2 microscope equipped with
I3 and M2 filters, HCX PL Fluotar 20X, 40x and 100x (for
oil immersion) objectives and an Olympus DP70 digital
color camera.
Six random fields (taken with the 40x optic) per
condition were analyzed by Image-J, to calculate M1 and
M2 Mander’s overlay coefficients. Briefly, the red (for
AlexaFluor-594 = EGFR) or green (for AlexaFluor-488 =
EEA1) channels of paired RGB images were extracted and
the relative threshold was calculated by the RenyiEntropy
algorithm. This restrictive algorithm was selected to allow
the analysis of medium-large endosomes, eliminating
most small-diameter particles (early endosomes) where
the overlay of EEA1 and EGFR was almost absolute. M1
an M2 Mander’s coefficients were calculated using the
JACoP plug-in (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/
JACoP_.class). Coefficients were plotted to describe the
time-dependent and reciprocal variations of co-localization
between EGFR and EEA1.

Subcellular fractionation
Crude lysosomal and endosomal fractions were
isolated by differential centrifugation following published
procedures [78, 79], with slight modifications. Briefly,
TAFs (10x106) were washed with ice-cold PBS and
scraped in 5ml PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended
in homogenization buffer (250mM sucrose, 0.5 mM
ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,N’tetra acetic acid (EGTA), 20mM Hepes-KOH pH 7) and
passed sequentially through a 21G1/2 needle (20 strokes)
and a 25G needle (20 strokes) fitted to a 1ml syringe.
The homogenate was centrifuged 10min at 1,000xg
and 2min at 8,000xg. The post-nuclear supernatant was
further fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a TL-100
ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA-100.3 fixed angle
