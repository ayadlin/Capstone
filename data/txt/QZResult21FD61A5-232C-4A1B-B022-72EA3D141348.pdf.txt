Abstract
Previously published reports indicate that serum copper levels are elevated in patients with prostate cancer and
that increased copper uptake can be used as a means to image prostate tumors. It is unclear, however, to what
extent copper is required for prostate cancer cell function as we observed only modest effects of chelation strategies
on the growth of these cells in vitro. With the goal of exploiting prostate cancer cell proclivity for copper uptake, we
developed a "conditional lethal" screen to identify compounds whose cytotoxic actions were manifested in a
copper-dependent manner. Emerging from this screen was a series of dithiocarbamates, which, when complexed
with copper, induced reactive oxygen species–dependent apoptosis of malignant, but not normal, prostate cells.
One of the dithiocarbamates identiﬁed, disulﬁram (DSF), is an FDA-approved drug that has previously yielded
disappointing results in clinical trials in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. Similarly, in our studies, DSF alone
had a minimal effect on the growth of prostate cancer tumors when propagated as xenografts. However, when DSF
was coadministered with copper, a very dramatic inhibition of tumor growth in models of hormone-sensitive and of
castrate-resistant disease was observed. Furthermore, we determined that prostate cancer cells express high levels
of CTR1, the primary copper transporter, and additional chaperones that are required to maintain intracellular
copper homeostasis. The expression levels of most of these proteins are increased further upon treatment of
androgen receptor (AR)–positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens. Not surprisingly, robust CTR1dependent uptake of copper into prostate cancer cells was observed, an activity that was accentuated by activation
of AR. Given these data linking AR to intracellular copper uptake, we believe that dithiocarbamate/copper
complexes are likely to be effective for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer whose disease is resistant to
classical androgen ablation therapies. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5819–31. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Patients with prostate cancer typically undergo a regimen of
endocrine treatments designed to block the transcriptional
activity of the androgen receptor (AR) by either decreasing the
production of endogenous androgens (e.g., GnRH agonists)
or competitively inhibiting the activities of androgenic ligands
(e.g., bicalutamide; ref. 1). Unfortunately, these therapies are
not curative, and most patients experience relapse of their
disease to a hormone-refractory or castration-resistant state.
In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the AR signaling axis remains intact, and, thus, most cancers are initially
responsive to second-line endocrine therapies such as CYP17

inhibitors (Abiraterone) and next-generation AR antagonists
(Enzalutamide; refs. 2–5). The therapeutic lifespan of these
drugs is relatively short, and there is a growing sentiment in the
ﬁeld that the resolution of the problem of resistance does not
lie in the development of better AR antagonists/steroid synthesis inhibitors. This position is supported by a large amount
of data indicating that the current approaches to achieve
androgen ablation can interrupt regulatory feedback loops
leading to (i) upregulation of steroidogenesis (6, 7), (ii)
increased receptor and coregulator expression (8, 9), (iii)
neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells (10,
11), and (iv) the selection for gene translocations/RNA splicing
events or receptor mutations that result in the production of
constitutively active AR variants (12–14). These activities have
been conﬁrmed in human tumors and hence are likely to
contribute in a signiﬁcant manner to treatment failure (15).
Thus, although tremendous progress has been made of late in
treating prostate cancer, there is clearly a need for agents that
target this disease in a unique manner.
Whereas most attention has focused on AR as a therapeutic
target, it is clear that there are other useful targets, the
pharmaceutical exploitation of which is likely to affect prostate
cancer progression. Notable in this regard are clinical studies
that have highlighted the potential utility of targeting MET and
SRC proto-oncogenes, AKT and several different growth factor

receptors (16). To complement this approach, we mined the
current literature on prostate cancer and available gene
expression data to identify pathways and processes whose
activity was restricted or particularly active in prostate cancer.
In this manner, we determined that all of the major components of the processes involved in uptake and trafﬁcking of
copper were upregulated in prostate cancer. Interestingly,
there is considerable data indicating that both circulating and
intratumoral copper levels are elevated in patients with prostate cancer (17–20). It is not clear why prostate cancer has such
a proclivity for copper uptake, although copper has been
suggested to play a role in RAS/MAP kinase pathway activation, a pathway that has been shown to have a role in cancer
pathogenesis (21). Whereas copper is an essential trace element required for the activity of a large number of enzymes and
structural proteins, the concentrations within prostate cancer
clearly exceed that required to support viability. Herein, we
describe our efforts to deﬁne the mechanisms by which
prostate cancer cells regulate copper homeostasis and how
this can be exploited in the development of therapeutic agents
that disrupt these activities.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Methyltrienolone (R1881) was purchased from PerkinElmer
and dissolved in DMSO. Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), disulﬁram (DSF), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), CuSO4, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC),
and L-Glutathione reduced (LGR) were obtained from Sigma .
TTM, DSF, and PDTC were dissolved in DMSO, whereas BCS,
CuSO4, NAC, and LGR in water. EUK118 was from Cayman
Chemical. Copper-64 was prepared at Washington University
(St. Louis, MO).
Cell culture
VCaP, LNCaP, 22RV1, PC3, and RWPE-1 parental cell lines
were obtained from the ATCC, which authenticates cell lines
by short tandem repeat proﬁling and passaged for less than 6
months. VCaP cells were cultured in DMEM, whereas
LNCaP, 22RV1, and PC3 cells in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies). All media were supplemented with 8% FBS (Sigma), 1
mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids (Life Technologies), and cells were maintained
in a 37 C incubator with 5% CO2. For androgen treatment
experiments, cells were plated in the same media lacking
phenol red and supplemented with 8% charcoal-stripped
FBS.
Proliferation assay
VCaP (10,000 cells/well) or LNCaP, 22RV1, PC3, RWPE-1
(5,000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates containing
regular FBS-containing media. The following day, the cells
were treated as indicated for an additional 72 hours. Cell
proliferation was measured using a ﬂuorometric resazurin
reduction method (Cell Titer-Blue; Promega). Each sample
was performed in triplicate, and the results from a representative experiment are shown. Results are expressed as relative
ﬂuorescence  SE (n ¼ 3).

Apoptosis assay
VCaP cells were collected and double stained with Alexa
Fluor 488 Annexin V and Sytox (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instruction. Annexin V–positive cells were
considered apoptotic, and their percentage of the total number
of cells was calculated. Ten thousand events were collected for
each sample using a BD Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer (BD), and
data were analyzed using the CFlow Plus program software
(BD).
ROS generation assay
Treated cells were stained with the oxidation-sensitive dye
H2DCFDA (5 mmol/L) for 60 minutes at 37 C, and the treatment was terminated by ice-cold PBS. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation was determined by FACS and quantiﬁed as
the geometric mean ﬂuorescence of a representative experiment. The increase in ﬂuorescence of treated versus untreated
samples is shown.
Xenograft study
Five-week-old NOD.SCID.gamma male mice were obtained
from the Cancer Center Isolation Facility (Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC). All experiments were performed according
to local animal experimental ethics committee guidelines and
were approved by an institutional review committee (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). VCaP (2  106) cells in
50% Matrigel (BD Matrigel Matrix; BD Biosciences) were
injected subcutaneously into the mouse right ﬂank. Tumor
size was measured with calipers, and tumor volume was
calculated using the formula volume ¼ (width2  length)/2.
When tumor size reached 200 mm3, mice bearing tumors were
randomized into four groups (n ¼ 12). Each group received two
separate daily i.p. injections of the following treatments: (i)
Control group (vehicle, vehicle) received 100 mL DMSO-Corn
oil and 100 mL of physiological saline (0.9%). (ii) The coppertreated group received 100 mL DMSO-Corn oil and 100 mL of
CuSO4 in physiologic saline (0.5 mg/kg). (iii) The DSF-treated
group received 100 mL of DSF (30 mg/kg in DMSO-Corn oil) and
100 mL physiologic saline. (iv) The DSF/Copper group received
100 mL of DSF (30 mg/kg in DMSO-Corn oil) and 100 mL of
CuSO4 (0.5 mg/kg) physiologic saline. For 22RV1 xenograft
study, 1  106 cells were injected subcutaneously into the
mouse right ﬂank. When tumor size reached approximately
150 mm3, mice bearing tumors were randomized into two
groups (n ¼ 5) to receive daily i.p. injections of the control [100
mL DMSO-Corn oil and 100 mL of physiologic saline (0.9%)] or
DSF/Copper [100 mL of DSF (30 mg/kg in DMSO-Corn oil) and
100 mL of CuSO4 (0.5 mg/kg)]. The study was terminated and
mice were humanely euthanized when tumor volume reached
approximately 1,000 mm3 (VCAP) or after 16 days of treatment
(22RV1). Tumor growth up to day 16 was analyzed by two-way
ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the Aurum Total RNA Mini-Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Total
RNA (1 mg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the iScript
cDNA synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The resulting cDNA was diluted

1:20 with water to use in qPCR analysis. qPCR was performed
using the Bio-Rad SYBR green supermix with 0.2 mmol/L of
each forward and reverse primer and 2.5 or 1.25 mL of diluted
cDNA in a total reaction volume of 6.5 or 3.25 mL. PCR
ampliﬁcation was carried out using the Bio-Rad iQ4 or the
CFX384 qPCR system. All primers used in the study were tested
to have PCR efﬁciency between 100%  10% and span intron/
exon boundaries when possible. Fold induction was calculated
using the 2DDCt method, and GAPDH was used as the normalization control. Data shown are representative of at least
three independent experiments. Gene-speciﬁc primers were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Immunoblot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer [50
mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, protease inhibitors (Sigma)]. Lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE
(7% polyacrylamide gels), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected using the following antibodies: CTR1 (22)
or GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
RNA silencing: (siRNA transfection)
Synthetic siRNA to knock down endogenous AR, CTR1, and
nonspeciﬁc siRNA-control (siCTRL) were synthesized by Invitrogen (Life Technologies). VCaP cells were plated at equal
densities in six-well plates (3.3  105 per well) overnight.
Subsequently, cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L siCTRL
or siRNA against AR or CTR1 using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Dharmacon). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated
overnight with 10 nmol/L R1881 and harvested for qPCR
analysis or copper uptake studies.
64

Cu uptake assay
VCaP cells were treated with 64Cu (5 mCi/mL as CuCl2) at
37 C in serum-free medium and incubated for different time
periods. After each incubation, cells were washed three
times with cold PBS, treated with Cell Lysis Reagent (Promega), and the resulting cell lysates were transferred to
separate micro-centrifuge tubes for gamma counting. The
radioactivity in cell lysates as well as corresponding supernatants was determined using a gamma counter (Wallac
Wizard 1480; Perkin-Elmer), and the values were normalized
to the total protein content of cells for each well as determined by the Bradford assay.

Results
Disruption of intracellular copper homeostasis as a
means to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth
Previous studies have shown that human prostate cancer
xenografts propagated in mice have the ability to take up
copper (23, 24). However, the utility of manipulating copper
uptake or intracellular copper biology has not been explored as
a therapeutic modality in prostate cancer. Thus, as a ﬁrst step,
we undertook a study to evaluate the impact of copper
chelation on prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. As
shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with the copper chelator TTM
efﬁciently inhibited the growth of AR-expressing LNCaP cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

Further, TTM also inhibited the growth of two different cellular
models of CRPC: VCaP cells in which AR is overexpressed
(Fig. 1B) and 22RV1 cells that express a constitutively active
AR-splice variant (Fig. 1C). However, the effects of TTM in
these cell lines were not as dramatic as that observed in LNCaP
cells and could only be achieved when high concentrations of
the chelator were used. The most disappointing ﬁnding, however, was that TTM treatment also inhibited the growth of
transformed normal epithelial RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the therapeutic window for copper chelation therapy
was extremely small. It was concluded therefore that copper
chelation in and of itself was not likely to be a viable therapeutic option for prostate cancer.
The uptake and regulation of intracellular copper levels
are tightly regulated, reﬂecting the balance between the
requirement for copper as a cofactor for many enzymes
and structural proteins and the need to prevent the oxidative
damage that is associated with the redox cycling of elemental copper within cells (25). We reasoned, therefore, that it
might be possible to employ a synthetic lethality approach to
identify drugs whose cytostatic/cytocidal activity would
capitalize on the ability of prostate cancer cells to take up
signiﬁcant amounts of copper. Thus, we screened for small
molecules that would inhibit the growth or induce apoptosis
of VCaP cells and whose activity was attenuated by the
coadministration of a sub-toxic dose of the copper chelator
TTM. Using this approach, we identiﬁed two chemically
distinct drugs that are members of the dithiocarbamate
family of metal-binding compounds (Fig. 2A). One of the
compounds identiﬁed, DSF (tetraethylthiuram disulﬁde),
has previously been identiﬁed in high-content screens for
prostate cancer therapeutics (26). It is an orally administered drug that is approved for use in alcohol aversion
therapy (27, 28). The second drug identiﬁed, ammonium
PDTC, is a known copper-binding compound and has only
been tested in vitro for anticancer activity (29). Importantly,
follow-up studies conﬁrmed that when tested over a broad
range of concentrations, the growth inhibitory activity of
these drugs in VCaP cells could be reversed by coadministration of a subtoxic dose of the copper chelators TTM or
BCS (Fig. 2B and C). Similarly, DSF dramatically inhibits the
growth of 22RV1 cells, and this activity can be reversed with
BCS (Fig. 2D). This result is particularly signiﬁcant as this
cell line expresses a truncated constitutively active AR
variant that renders the cells resistant to all of the currently
available androgen synthesis inhibitors and antiandrogens
(Fig. 2E) and is a well-validated model of advanced disease.
DSF also has a profound copper-dependent effect on the
growth of the AR-negative PC3 prostate cancer cell line (Fig.
2F). Thus, the cytotoxic effect of DSF is not restricted to ARpositive prostate cancer cells. Finally, it was shown that DSF
had no effect on the growth of normal RWPE-1 cells at the
concentrations tested (Fig. 2G). We conclude from these
studies that DSF and PDTC inhibit prostate cancer cell
growth in a manner that likely capitalizes on the ability of
these cells to accumulate copper. Deﬁning the speciﬁc role
for copper in dithiocarbamate activity was the goal of our
next series of studies.

The growth inhibitory activity of DSF is absolutely
dependent on copper
Considering the copper-binding speciﬁcity of the two chelators (TTM and BCS) used in our studies, it was likely that the
growth inhibitory activity of DSF required its interaction with
copper. We therefore asked whether copper supplementation
could enhance the growth inhibitory activity of DSF. To this
end, VCaP cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
DSF alone or with copper supplementation. In this manner, we
showed that copper supplementation enhances the cytotoxic
effect of DSF (Fig. 3A). Thus, as opposed to DSF, the ability of
TTM to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation was reversed
by the coadministration of copper, highlighting the distinct
mechanisms of action of the two drugs (Fig. 3B). The ability of
copper to enhance DSF cytotoxicity was conﬁrmed in the ARpositive prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and 22RV1, as well as
in the AR-negative PC3 cells (Fig. 3C–E). As expected, the
treatment with the copper chelator BCS abrogated the cytotoxic effect of DSF in the presence of additional copper in all
cells. Together, these results suggest that although the available copper in the media used in these studies is sufﬁcient for
DSF action, the efﬁcacy of the drug can be enhanced significantly by additional copper supplementation.
Reduction of copper from Cu(II) to Cu(I) by the metalloreductases is an obligate step for efﬁcient transport across the
plasma membrane by the high-afﬁnity transporter CTR1 (30,
31). Indeed, it has been shown previously that divalent metal

ions do not inhibit copper uptake by CTR1, whereas an excess
of silver ions that are isoelectronic and of similar size to Cu(I)
block the CTR1-mediated copper uptake (32). We therefore
assessed the ability of Ag(I) to block DSF-mediated inhibition
of cell growth. To this end, VCaP cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of DSF alone or in the presence of
additional copper to enhance the antiproliferative effect of
DSF. Interestingly, coadministration of excess silver ions
abolishes the cytotoxicity induced by both DSF alone or DSF
in the presence of copper (Fig. 3F). This result is consistent with
a role for CTR1-mediated uptake of copper in regulating the
cytotoxic actions of DSF. In previous studies using cellular
models of melanoma it has been shown that DSF:Au and DSF:
Ag complexes are growth inhibitory (33). However, the ability
to reverse DSF:Cu activity with Ag suggests that the DSF:Cu
complex is functioning in a different manner in prostate cancer
cells. These data also suggest that tumors with high intrinsic
copper levels, or those that can be manipulated to uptake
copper, are likely to exhibit the greatest therapeutic response
to DSF.
DSF induces prostate cancer cell apoptosis
The impact of DSF and DSF:Cu on prostate cancer cell
apoptosis was evaluated by measuring Annexin V staining
using ﬂow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Fig. S1, treatment of VCaP cells for 24 hours with DSF alone
increased the Annexin V–positive cell population (5.1% of

apoptosis was abrogated by the copper chelator BCS (Fig. 4).
Together, these results indicate that DSF-mediated inhibition
of prostate cancer cell growth can be attributed in large part to
its ability to induce apoptosis in a copper-dependent manner.
ROS as a mediator of the copper-dependent cytotoxic
effects of DSF
Copper, a transition metal with multiple oxidation states,
can participate in single-electron transfer reactions. Therefore,
given the chemistry of the interaction between copper and
DSF, we hypothesized that the inherent redox shuttling of
copper [Cu(I)/Cu(II)/Cu(III)] within Cu–dithiocarbamate
complexes could generate free radicals that would facilitate
ROS formation (34–36). It was of signiﬁcance, therefore, that

treatment of cells with the free-radical scavenger NAC blocked
cell death induced by DSF:Cu. Similar results were obtained
when prostate cancer cells were treated with the free-radical
scavenger, LGR, in the presence of DSF alone or in combination
with supplementary copper (Fig. 4). These antioxidants also
blocked the cytotoxic actions of DSF:Cu in other prostate
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2, data not shown).
Both of the antioxidants NAC and LGR reversed the antiproliferative effect of DSF in the presence or absence of added
copper (Fig. 5A). Further, cotreatment of the VCaP cells with
EUK118, a synthetic catalytic scavenger of ROS with superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic activity (37), blocked DSFmediated inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 5B). Together, these
results implicate ROS in DSF-mediated cell death. Thus, we

directly measured intracellular free-radical production in DSFtreated cells using the cell-permeable oxidation-sensitive dye
CM-H2DCFDA. For this assay, VCaP cells treated for 2 days
with H2O2 were used as positive controls. Using this approach,
we were able to establish that addition of DSF resulted in
robust CM-H2DCFDA oxidation when compared with controltreated cells (Fig. 5C). To analyze whether elevation of intracellular copper is a prerequisite for the induction of oxidative
stress, VCaP cells were coincubated with the copper chelator
BCS. As seen in Fig. 5C, cotreatment with the copper chelator
BCS blocked both DSF-dependent generation of ROS and
apoptosis. These data are consistent with the idea that DSF:
Cu induces prostate cancer cell apoptosis secondary to its
ability to induce intracellular ROS production.
Copper enhances the growth inhibitory activity of DSF in
xenograft models of prostate cancer
In agreement with our in vitro data, it has been demonstrated, using PET imaging, that human prostate cancer xenografts
propagated as tumors in mice have a high capacity to uptake
and accumulate copper (23, 24). We therefore asked whether
the therapeutic activity of DSF could be enhanced using copper
supplementation to increase intratumoral copper within VCaP
cells propagated as xenografts in immunodeﬁcient mice. To

this end, the effect of DSF alone or in combination with copper
treatment was evaluated. For comparative purposes, a vehicle
control group and a copper alone group were also included in
this study. In this manner, it was shown that although DSF
alone had only marginal effects on tumor growth, treatment
with a combination of DSF and copper signiﬁcantly decreased
tumor growth (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, the effect of DSF and
copper in a well-validated model of CRPC was evaluated. To
this end, 22RV1 cells, which express a constitutively active ARsplice variant, were propagated as xenografts in castrated,
immunodeﬁcient mice. Similar to what we observed in VCaP
cells, DSF:Cu efﬁciently inhibited the growth of 22RV1 tumors
when compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6B). Taken
together, the in vivo data are consistent with the in vitro data
and reinforce the concept that the combined treatment of DSF
and copper has superior activity in targeting prostate cancer
cells than either agent alone with no observable increase in
animal toxicity or weight loss.
AR upregulates the expression of key proteins required
for cellular copper homeostasis
Whereas the antiproliferative activities of DSF observed
were not restricted to AR-positive prostate cancer cells, we
were intrigued by the observation that the expression of several

proteins involved in the uptake and trafﬁcking of copper was
upregulated by androgens in VCaP cells. Speciﬁcally, using
qPCR, we determined that the synthetic androgen R1881
increased the transcript levels of CTR1 (copper uptake),
ATP7B (copper trafﬁcking), and STEAP4 (metallo/copper
reductase; Fig. 7A). Furthermore, siRNAs targeting AR dramatically reduced the androgen-mediated upregulation of these
transcripts (Fig. 7B). Importantly, androgens also increased
CTR1 protein levels, an effect that was also dependent on AR
(Fig. 7C). In addition, at a concentration that inhibits the
expression of secondary androgen responsive target genes
(e.g., INSIG1), cycloheximide treatment did not block the
R1881-mediated increase in CTR1, ATP7B, or STEAP4 mRNA
levels (Supplementary Fig. S4). In LNCaP cells, only STEAP4
was shown to be upregulated by androgens (Supplementary
Fig. S5). This may relate to the differences in AR expression in
the two models with VCaP cells exhibiting AR overexpression,
and thus a good model of late-stage CRPC, and LNCaP expressing less AR, modeling an earlier stage in the disease. This
ﬁnding is signiﬁcant as AR expression has been found to be
consistently upregulated during tumor progression, and that a
2- to 3-fold increase in AR protein levels is sufﬁcient to facilitate
the transition of prostate cancer cells from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory state in experimental animal

5826

models (8). Thus, we engineered LNCaP cells to express higher
levels of AR and found that this resulted in signiﬁcantly higher
levels of CTR1 and ATP7B expression in response to androgen
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, similar
results were obtained when the immortalized RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cell line was engineered to express high levels of
AR (Supplementary Fig. S5). Collectively, these ﬁndings validate CTR1, ATP7B, and STEAP4 as bona ﬁde AR target genes in
prostate cancer cells. However, the insensitivity of RWPE-1-AR
cells to DSF indicates that although androgens can increase the
expression of proteins involved in copper homeostasis, this
activity alone is not sufﬁcient to confer sensitivity to these
agents. Although it does suggest that cells have an inherent
sensitivity to DSF, the upregulation of AR-target gene expression as occurs in late-stage disease may sensitize cells to
DSF:Cu.
Androgens increase cellular copper uptake
CTR1 is the primary copper transporter in mammalian cells,
and we have shown that it is signiﬁcantly expressed in prostate
cancer cells and that androgens can further increase its
expression. Given this observation, we sought to determine
the importance of CTR1 on cellular copper uptake in prostate
cancer cells using radioactive copper (64Cu). As expected,

ionophore activity of this compound (38, 39). Regardless,
these results suggest that the increased accumulation of
copper in prostate cancer cells can be attributed to a
signiﬁcant expression of CTR1, and that the expression and
functional activity of this transporter can be upregulated by
androgens. The latter ﬁnding is of particular signiﬁcance, as
it suggests that CRPC cells take up a signiﬁcantly higher level
of copper and would by inference exhibit increased sensitivity to DSF.

siRNA-mediated CTR1 knockdown resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in 64Cu uptake (Fig. 7E), indicating that copper uptake
into prostate cancer cells is largely dependent on CTR1 expression. Next, we investigated the effect of androgen treatment on
cellular copper uptake. As expected, there is a signiﬁcant timedependent increase in 64Cu uptake into prostate cancer cells in
the basal state, and this uptake is accentuated when cells are
pretreated with an androgen agonist (Fig. 7G). The uptake of
64
Cu was quantitatively inhibited by coincubation with a 100fold molar excess of nonradioactive copper, a result that
supports the involvement of a speciﬁc, saturable transporter
in regulating copper uptake (Fig. 7G). We have also found that
addition of DSF to the incubation media further increases the
copper accumulation in cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, it is unclear whether this is a consequence of DSF trapping
copper within cells or if it is related to the reported metal

Discussion
A common objective in the development of chemotherapeutics is to identify compounds whose cytostatic/cytotoxic actions require, or are reinforced by, proteins or
processes that are selectively expressed in malignant cells.
It was of considerable importance, therefore, that several
investigators noted that prostate cancer has a particular
proclivity for copper uptake that was not apparent in normal
prostate (17–19). These ﬁndings, together with the observation that copper was required for angiogenesis in prostate
cancer, led to the initiation of several clinical trials that
evaluated the impact of copper chelation in patients with
CRPC. Unfortunately, no signiﬁcant impact on clinical outcomes in prostate cancer was observed using this therapeutic strategy (40, 41). Copper chelation using TTM is currently
being evaluated in several clinical trials, alone or in combination with chemotherapy/radiation, in patients with
advanced solid tumors, including breast, lung, esophageal,
colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma (www.clinicaltrials.gov). It will be of interest to see whether this strategy
works in other cancers and if information can be drawn from
these studies that would inform better approaches to use
chelation therapy in prostate cancer. However, considering
the narrow therapeutic window we observed in the sensitivity of normal versus malignant prostate cancer cells to
copper chelators in vitro, it is unlikely that copper chelation,
as currently contemplated, will play a signiﬁcant role in the
management of prostate cancer.
Recently, we made the unexpected ﬁnding that both ARpositive and AR-negative prostate cancer cells overexpress
many of the proteins required for copper uptake and trafﬁcking
and that in AR-positive prostate cancer cells, the expression of
these proteins can be accentuated by androgens. Further, a
robust uptake of copper into prostate cancer cells was
observed, an activity that was increased further by androgens.
With a view to exploiting this propensity for copper uptake, we
developed a "conditional lethal" screen to identify compounds
whose cytotoxic activities required copper. Using this
approach, two drugs, both members of the dithiocarbamate
family of metal-binding compounds, were identiﬁed. The
actions of both of these drugs were inhibited by classical
copper chelators, a ﬁnding that highlights their unique mechanism of action. One of the compounds identiﬁed, DSF, an
FDA-approved drug, has extensive clinical and pharmacologic
experience and is used for the treatment of alcohol abuse (27,
28, 42, 43). Interestingly, this drug was identiﬁed previously in a
screen for prostate cancer therapeutics and was subsequently
evaluated in a multicenter phase II clinical study in men with

Copper Signaling in Prostate Cancer

nonmetastatic recurrent prostate cancer after local therapy.
The results of this trial were disappointing, and no signiﬁcant
beneﬁt of the drug was observed (44). However, in studies
performed both in vitro and in vivo, we have found that the
activity of DSF absolutely requires copper. Using PET imaging
and 64Cu as an imaging agent, it was observed by others that
prostate cancer tumors propagated as xenografts have a
particularly high capacity to accumulate copper (23, 24).
However, notwithstanding this ability to accumulate copper,
we demonstrated that DSF has a minimal impact on tumor
growth unless animals were supplemented with copper. Thus,
although prostate cancer cells express the transporters that
enable them to uptake copper, it appears as if the available
copper in the blood of unsupplemented animals, and by
inference humans, is not sufﬁcient to confer sensitivity to
DSF. This has important implications with respect to the
interpretation of the recently completed clinical trials of DSF
as it brings into question whether or not the treated tumors
had copper levels sufﬁcient to confer sensitivity to the drug. To
address this issue, we have designed, and will soon enroll into, a
clinical trial (FDA approval IND 116012) to examine the
antitumor activity of DSF in the setting of parenteral copper
supplementation. The primary goal of this trial is to evaluate
the feasibility of manipulating intratumoral copper levels in
patients with prostate cancer as a means to sensitize the
tumors to DSF.
In preclinical studies, several mechanisms of action
underlying the antiproliferative effect of DSF have been
reported, including generation of ROS, inhibition of DNA
methyltransferase and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, activities that are potentiated by copper supplementation (45–
50). However, these actions were only observed using drug
concentrations far exceeding that which we demonstrated to
effectively inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. In our studies,
it was demonstrated that intracellular ROS production is
dramatically elevated in cells upon cotreatment with DSF
and copper. This activity is likely to be important for
therapeutic efﬁcacy as prostate cancer cell apoptosis
induced by DSF:Cu can be inhibited by blocking ROS production using free-radical scavengers. Although the mechanisms underlying ROS production were not addressed in our
study, it is likely due to the free-radical formation that
results from the inherent redox shuttling of copper (Cu
(I)/Cu(II)) within Cu–dithiocarbamate complexes (34,
35, 38). These highly reactive species target a variety of
biologic molecules, including DNA, RNA, cholesterol, lipids,
carbohydrates, and proteins. In normal cells, free-radical
generation is balanced by processes that facilitate antioxidant defense. However, this equilibrium is upset in prostate
cancer cells, favoring oxidation and increased ROS production. A question that remains unanswered is why the DSF:Cu
complex is selectively toxic to malignant versus nonmalignant prostate cancer cells. The ability of prostate cancer to
accumulate copper is certainly important; however, it is also
likely that the highly oxidative environment within cancer
cells predisposes them to ROS generation (51–55). Understanding the mechanism(s) underlying this speciﬁcity will

www.aacrjournals.org

likely inform the optimal use of this drug or a related drug:
metal conjugate.
The mechanism(s) by which copper is taken up into cells has
been elucidated in detail. In blood, copper (Cu(II)) is highly
protein bound being associated with ceruloplasmin or albumin.
At the cell surface, metalloreductases (STEAP family members)
convert Cu(II) to Cu(I), allowing it to be transported into cells by
the CTR1 (16). Once inside the cell, carrier cytoplasmic metallochaperones deliver copper to speciﬁc cellular targets and
compartments. One of the surprising ﬁndings of our study is
that the expression of all of the key regulators of copper
homeostasis (CTR1, STEAP4, ATP7B, and ATP7A) is either
expressed at a high basal level and/or can be induced upon
AR activation. Not surprisingly, we have shown that copper
uptake into prostate cancer cells can be increased by androgens,
although it is important to note that the basal expression of
these proteins enables the uptake of enough copper to sensitize
cells to DSF. Interestingly, we have shown that DSF treatment
increases overall copper accumulation into prostate cancer
cells. However, it is unclear whether this reﬂects an ability of
DSF to trap copper within cells or if DSF can facilitate copper
uptake by functioning as an ionophore (38, 39).
In summary, we have demonstrated that prostate cancer
cells accumulate copper and that this can be exploited to
sensitize cells to the cytotoxic actions of dithiocarbamates. The
absolute requirement of copper supplementation for the positive therapeutic action of DSF in animals has informed a
clinical trial that will explore the impact of copper supplementation on DSF efﬁcacy in patients with advanced prostate
cancer.
