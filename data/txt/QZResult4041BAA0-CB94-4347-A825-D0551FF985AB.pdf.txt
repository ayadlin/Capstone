Chemotoxicity Recurrence in Older Patients: Risk Factors and
Effectiveness of Preventive Strategies—A Prospective Study
Martine Extermann, MD1,2; Richard R. Reich, MD1,3; and Marina Sehovic, MD1

BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and adjustment rules after
severe toxicity are derived by consensus, but to the authors’ knowledge little is known regarding the determinants of toxicity recurrence, especially in the elderly. METHODS: The authors prospectively accrued 200 patients (aged 65 years) before chemotherapy.
For those with CTCAE grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic or CTCAE grade 4 hematologic toxicities (severe toxicity), the duration and functional impact, treatment modifications, and severe toxicity recurrence were recorded. The regimen’s toxicity was adjusted with the
MAX2 index, the average of the most frequent grade 4 hematologic toxicities and the most frequent grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic
toxicities reported in publications of a regimen. RESULTS: The median patient age was 73 years (range, 65-90 years). Among 163
patients who were evaluable for toxicity after 1 treatment cycle (receiving on average 4.73 cycles), 82 had severe toxicity, 10 were
discontinued for toxicity, 6 were discontinued for other reasons, and 5 patients had died. Sixty-one patients received further chemotherapy: 41 without dose modification (16 with secondary prevention measures) and 20 with dose modifications. Without modification, 19 patients (46%) experienced toxicity recurrence (0 deaths). With modification, 7 patients (35%) experienced a toxicity
recurrence (1 death). On univariate analysis, treatment intent, hospitalization, duration-adjusted activities of daily living (ADL), quality
of life impact, and fatigue were associated with dose modification. ADL remained associated on multivariate analysis (P 5.02). On
univariate analysis for toxicity recurrence, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and MAX2 score demonstrated
an association, with only the latter found to remain statistically significant on multivariate analysis (P 5.04). CONCLUSIONS: If a
severe toxicity does not have a long duration of impact on ADL, oncologists are less inclined to modify treatment. With proper supportive measures, this leads to recurrence risks similar to those shown in patients with modified treatment, with low risks of toxic

INTRODUCTION
Assessing the severity of side effects from chemotherapy in a reproducible manner is a familiar issue for clinical trialists.
Over the years, the National Cancer Institute has developed a consensus definition: the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which is currently in its fourth version.1 Clinical trials often recommend treatment modification in cases of grade 4 hematologic or grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Although grade 3 hematologic toxicity is
often lumped in with the group, dose modifications are rarely recommended for patients with grade 3 neutropenia or leukopenia, which are the most frequent of these toxicities by far. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity and/or grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity (hereafter called “severe toxicity”) is experienced by 50% of older patients with cancer in a clinical
setting.2,3 However, we observed that the functional impact of those toxicities is variable and that chemotherapy is often
continued at good doses.2 When we further explored the appropriateness of this management approach, we were surprised
to note that, in clinical practice, approximately 40% of older patients did not have dose modifications and that this
appeared to be safe, with actually fewer recurrences of toxicities noted among the patients without dose modifications.4
Because no direct correlation with patients’ baseline characteristics was noted, this suggested some factor recognized by
the clinician at the time of toxicity. We hypothesized that, if a severe toxicity was of short duration and did not have a functional impact, it would be safe to continue the chemotherapy at full dose. Furthermore, identifying older patients at low
risk of further toxicity has a clear potential for improving treatment delivery and patient outcomes. In the current study,

we addressed 2 questions: 1) do short toxicities with low
functional impact correlate with maintenance of treatment dose by the oncologist and 2) does that targeted
dose maintenance lead to an equal or lower rate of toxicity
recurrence versus that shown in patients who had dose
modification after toxicity?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study was a prospective observational cohort
study of patients treated with chemotherapy at the H. Lee
Moffitt Cancer Center. Patients had to be aged 65 years
and have a histologically or cytologically documented malignant tumor. A chemotherapy regimen that included at
least 1 classic chemotherapy agent had to be planned. The
chemotherapy regimen and management were left to the
discretion of the treating oncologist, provided it was a
published regimen and was not an aplasiant treatment
(eg, an acute leukemia or a transplant regimen). The toxicity of the regimen was rated with the MAX2 index.2,5
Briefly, the MAX2 index is the average of the most
frequent grade 4 hematologic toxicity and the most
frequent grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity reported in
publications of a regimen and correlates well with the average overall risk of severe toxicity for that regimen. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of dementia, chemotherapy
administered within <3 weeks, life expectancy of <3
months, and concomitant radiotherapy. Palliative radiation to <25% of bone marrow was allowed but had to be
completed before chemotherapy was initiated. All other
radiation needed to be completed at least 4 weeks before
chemotherapy. Adequate English and cognitive skills were
required to provide written informed consent and answer
the study questionnaires. Baseline functional status was
assessed with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS),6 the activities of daily
living (ADL) by Katz et al,7 and Lawton’s 9-item instrumental ADL (IADL).8 Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Symptoms Inventory (FSI),9 using the interference
score (with 0 being the best). Comorbidity was assessed
with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric
(CIRS-G).10 Toxicity assessment was prospective. Weekly
complete blood counts were required. Initially, these were
required for the entire duration of treatment; however,
the protocol was later amended to allow low-risk patients
(ie, patients who did not experience any neutropenia
during the first cycle and had a regimen with a MAX2
score <0.2011) to forgo weekly complete blood counts
after the first cycle. Patients were assessed at each prechemotherapy visit according to version 4 of the CTCAE
and occurrences of grade 4 hematologic toxicity or grade

3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity (severe toxicity) were
recorded, as well as whether treatment was modified as a
consequence. Modifications of doses or drugs in the
chemotherapy as well as modifications of supportive
measures were tallied. The functional impact of the toxicity was rated with ECOG PS, ADL, IADL, FSI interference score, and a quality of life (QOL) impact question,
using ratings of 0 (not at all) to 10 (terrible). We chose a
unidimensional QOL scale for the following reasons: such
scales have been validated by Sloan et al12 and their performance compares well with multidimensional QOL
instruments; rating symptom intensity on a scale of 0 to
10 is familiar to patients; and, as we sought to identify
factors that influence oncologists’ decision-making, we
wanted a measure close to clinical practice, in which typically simple, short QOL questions are asked. Function
and QOL were assessed at the time of the first visit after
severe toxicity occurrence, and duration of the toxicity
(either reported by the patient or measured clinically) was
recorded. Patients were reassessed at each subsequent
pre-chemotherapy visit with the same functional/QOL
assessment, with recurrence of severe toxicity recorded.
Follow-up was until the end of the last chemotherapy
cycle or an upper time limit of 6 months. The magnitude
of the dose modifications was calculated using the relative
dose-intensity method of Hryniuk et al.13 The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of South Florida.
Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 200 patients was calculated as having an
80% power of detecting odds ratios (ORs) for treatment
change of 1.5 on logistic regression with a nominal
alpha of .05, and deemed feasible within the 2-year duration of our funding grant. The same analytic approach
was used for both outcome variables: treatment modification (in increasing severity: none, modified, or stopped)
and toxicity recurrence (yes/no). First, we conducted univariate analyses to identify clinical and toxicity parameters
that, by themselves, were correlated with outcome. Next,
we entered univariate factors with correlates having a
P value of .05 into a multivariate regression model to
identify which factors accounted for unique variance in
outcome likelihood. A hierarchical linear regression
model was used to test treatment modification status.
Because our hypothesis was that treatment would be
maintained in the case of short, low-impact toxicity, we
ran the analysis with 2 models: one in which the duration
and functional impact of the toxicity were treated independently, and one in which the functional impact scores

were multiplied by the duration of the severe toxicity. A
binary logistic regression model was used to test toxicity
recurrence. We explored both the absolute value of the
variable (eg, IADL score) and the value expressed as a
change from baseline (eg, baseline IADL-toxicity IADL).
RESULTS
A total of 200 patients were accrued between October
2009 and May 2011. The evolution of patients throughout their chemotherapy is presented in Figure 1 (a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials [CONSORT]
2986

diagram). A total of 163 patients were fully evaluable for
toxicity. The median age of the patients was 73 years
(range, 65-90 years). The baseline characteristics were
similar between the patients who did and those who did
not experience severe toxicity, with the following exception: whereas 45% of the cohort was female, 87% of those
with toxicity were female versus 3% of those without (Table 1). This is not a common finding in similar studies.3,14,15 One explanation lies in the fact that women on
average received more toxic chemotherapies (mean
MAX2 of 0.15 for women vs 0.12 for men; P 5 .04).

beyond the third cycle. The median duration of the initial
toxicity was 7 days (range, 0-20 days), and 30 patients
were hospitalized (23 continued treatment). Fifty patients
experienced a grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity, and
2988

33 patients had a grade 4 hematologic toxicity (1 patient
had both). The median perceived impact of the toxicity
on QOL was 7 (range, 0-10), the median number of
impaired ADL was 0 (range, 0-4), the median IADL score
was 25 (range, 14-29), the median ECOG PS was 1
(range, 0-4), and the median FSI interference score was
13 (range, 0-59). The mean number of cycles received was
4.61 (standard deviation [SD], 1.28) versus 4.89 (SD,
1.43) in the group with and without toxicity, respectively,
allowing a good follow-up after first toxicity. The median
dose intensity received was 87% (range, 17%-117%). It
was 94% (33-117) in patients without severe toxicity, and
79% (17-102) in the patients with severe toxicity. Among
the latter group, the dose intensity received was 96% (33102) among those with their dose unchanged at the time
of first severe toxicity, 73% (41-93) among those with a
dose change, and 67% (17-100) among those who
stopped treatment (the wide range interval was due to heterogeneous reasons for stopping treatment).
Treatment Adaptation

Of the 82 patients who had a severe toxicity, 5 patients
died, 6 patients discontinued treatment for unrelated reasons, and 10 patients discontinued treatment for toxicity.
A total of 61 patients continued treatment, 20 of whom
had a change in their regimen. The other 41 patients had
no dose change but 16 patients received secondary prevention measures: 5 had antibiotic prophylaxis, 3 received
anticoagulation, 2 received granulocyte growth factors, 2
received pain medicines, and 5 patients received other
measures (some patients received multiple measures).
There were no clear differences with regard to tumor type,
stage of disease, or toxicity subtype between patients who
did and those who did not receive secondary prevention
measures. Recurrences of toxicity occurred in both patient
subsets. On univariate analysis without duration adjustment, the characteristics associated with treatment modifications were treatment with curative intent (P<.05),
hospitalization (P<.05), impact on QOL (P<.05), and
ADL score (P<.01) (Table 3). On the multivariate analysis, no variable was found to be statistically significant at
the P<.05 level, although ADL demonstrated a trend at
0.08 (Table 4). This overall model had an adjusted R2 of
0.11. In the duration-adjusted analysis, treatment with
curative intent (P<.05), hospitalization (P<.05), and
impact on QOL*duration (QOL times duration)
(P<.05), ADL*duration (P<.01), and FSI*duration
(P<.05) were associated with treatment modification. On
multivariate analysis, 1 variable, ADL*duration, remained
statistically significant (P 5 .02), whereas hospitalization

demonstrated a trend (P 5 .092), with a better overall performance of the variables (Table 5). This model explained
nearly twice as much variance in modification (adjusted
R2, 0.21) as did the model that was not adjusted for duration. We repeated the analyses using the degree of change
from baseline, but the absolute values at the time of toxicity provided more precise results (results not shown). A
significant amount of variance remains unexplained. Part
of that may be due to the relatively low number of patients
in the current study, and the R2 for the same variables
might increase in a larger sample. We suspect that, in the

absence of well-established data and guidelines, a good
amount of residual variance simply reflects interphysician
variation. We explored whether the comorbidity level
might explain part of this variance. However, the baseline

change (OR, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],

chemotherapy for toxicity could not provide information
regarding recurrence. Sixteen patients had a grade 4 hematologic toxicity and 10 patients had a grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Thirteen patients recurred with the
same toxicity as the original one, whereas 13 patients
recurred with a different toxicity. The recurrence rate was
46% (95% CI, 31%-62%) with no deaths noted in the
group without modification, and was 35% (95% CI,
14%-56%) with 1 death noted in the group with modification. On univariate analysis, the MAX2 score
(0.13 6 0.07 in the group without recurrence vs
0.17 6 09 in the group with recurrence) and the ECOG
PS (0:16%; PS of 1-2: 84% vs PS of 0: 39%; PS of 1-2:
54%; and PS of 3-4: 7%) were the only variables associated with toxicity recurrence (P<.05) (Table 6). Specific
secondary prophylaxis had no additional impact. On the
multivariable analysis, the MAX2 score remained associated with toxicity recurrence (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.052.79 [P<.05]), whereas ECOG PS results were not significant (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.57-3.79 [P = .42]). We
explored whether baseline comorbidity influenced recurrence of toxicity. The baseline CIRS-G total score was not
found to be associated with recurrence (OR, 0.99; 95%
CI, 0.89-1.12 [P = .97]).
Effectiveness of Dose-Adjustment Strategies

We performed a series of analyses to identify an effective
dose modification approach for possible use in future clinical trials. There were 2 dominant patterns of dose modifications: dose delay alone and dose reduction with or
without delay. After dose delay alone, 6 of 8 patients had a
recurrence of toxicity versus 1 of 12 patients with reduction and 19 of 41 patients without (P 5 .009). Therefore,
dose delay alone was not an effective dose modification
strategy. We analyzed whether patients with uncomplicated grade 4 neutropenia were experiencing recurrence
2990

simply with an uncomplicated grade 4 neutropenia. However, the pattern of recurrence was heterogeneous, with
both hematologic and nonhematologic severe toxicity.
Although the numbers in the current study are small, they
do not support treating grade 4 neutropenia fundamentally
differently from other toxicities (although it is less likely to
have an impact on QOL and functioning). We analyzed
hospitalization, low ADLs, impact on QOL, and duration
of toxicity alone and in combination to model the most
discriminative approach in terms of prevention of recurrent toxicity. However, due to our limited numbers and
the heterogeneous impact of dose modification strategies, we could not identify a clearly dominant strategy.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, there is surprisingly little
published data regarding the recurrence of toxicity from
chemotherapy. Typical clinical trials report the most
severe grade of a given toxicity but not the number of
times the toxicity occurred in a given patient. Some studies have focused on specific toxicities, such as neutropenia
or cardiac toxicity, usually in relation to a specific secondary prevention (eg, Freyer et al16 and Tarantini et al17).
To our knowledge, the current study is the first to investigate the global effectiveness of the management of toxicity
in daily practice. The findings suggest that the current version of the CTCAE, established by expert consensus,
might be improved by integrating the functional impact
of a given toxicity. We hypothesized that toxicities classified as severe by version 4.0 of the CTCAE that are brief
and of low functional impact would be associated with
maintenance of the treatment plan and that this approach
would be safe. The results of the current study support the
validity of our hypotheses, although confirmation and development in larger cohorts will be needed. The best correlation with treatment modifications was obtained by

variables that combined toxicity duration and functional
impact. One might argue that the duration of a severe
functional impact might have been better measured with
patient diaries. However, the primary goal of the current
study was to understand which factors influence the decisions of an oncologist in daily practice. Diaries are not
typically available in this setting, but recall information at
the subsequent visit is. Future trials that are more oriented
toward identifying a threshold functional impact and its
duration to inform post-toxicity decisions might opt to
use a diary approach. From a safety point of view, all the
treatment-related deaths, except for one, occurred at the
time of the first toxicity, early in the treatment. This is
compatible with other data from the literature. For example, in a study in older patients with lymphoma treated
with the CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and granulocyte colonystimulating factor, 22 of 35 treatment-related deaths
occurred during the first cycle.18 However, the results of
the current study highlighted the heterogeneous effectiveness of the management strategies in preventing a recurrence of severe toxicities. The approach of purely delaying
treatment without a dose reduction did not appear to be
Cancer

effective. This finding might be taken into consideration
when designing toxicity management schemes in future
clinical trials.
The only factor found to be associated with recurrence of toxicity was the MAX2 score (P 5 .04). This constitutes a further validation of this useful index in
conducting comparisons between chemotherapy regimens. However, it should be noted that the total number
of severe toxicity recurrences was small26; therefore, the
percentages in each treatment group have wide overlapping CIs.
The median time to first toxicity was short: 29 days.
In the Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for HighAge Patients (CRASH) trial, it was 22 days.3 Taken together with the amount of complications from first toxicity (Fig. 1), this highlights the critical need for a proper
design of the chemotherapy plan in the elderly. Recently,
several models have become available that may assist with
decision-making.3,14,15,19 Some aim at predicting the risk
of severe toxicity according to CTCAE,3,14 whereas others
have focused on the ability of the patient to complete
chemotherapy.15,19 Collectively, these models highlight
the importance of considering geriatric parameters when
planning chemotherapy. Future research should focus on
the best way to use these models in clinical trial design, so
that an appropriate chemotherapy dose can be given at the
first cycle that is both high enough to be effective and low
enough to decrease the important dropout rate due to
severe initial complications. A formal study of doseadjustment strategies that integrates functional impact of
the first toxicity might compare the dose intensity
achieved with this alternate strategy versus standard dose
reduction schemes. Observing such a difference would be
a first step in our attempt to improve the outcomes of
older patients treated with chemotherapy.
The current study has limitations. It is a singleinstitution study in a large academic center. Oncologists
in other settings such as private practice might apply different rules and the findings reported herein might not
extend to them. The current study results should not be
used in clinical practice until validated by studies conducted in other populations. The study size is also relatively small, thereby limiting the generalizability of the
current study findings, notably the negative ones, and
other variables may be found in future studies that also
influence recurrence of severe toxicity. Larger studies will
help to refine our understanding of this important clinical
issue.
If a severe toxicity does not have a long duration of
impact on ADL, oncologists in an academic setting appear
2991

Original Article

to be less inclined to modify treatment. With proper supportive measures, this strategy appears to lead to recurrence risks similar to those noted among patients who had
modified treatment, with a low risk of toxic deaths overall.
This finding needs to be confirmed and further detailed in
larger studies. The results of the current study confirmed
the overall safety of the dose-reduction strategies used,
although their effectiveness could be optimized. In clinical
trials, adjusting dose-reduction recommendations to duration and functional impact of toxicity might lead to
fewer dose reductions and better dose intensity throughout the trial. Further research is needed to find the best
way to design these adjustments.
