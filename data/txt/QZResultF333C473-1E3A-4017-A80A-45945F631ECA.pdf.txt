ABSTRACT
To get better chemotherapy efficacy, the optimal synergic effect of Paclitaxel
(PTX) and Temozolomide (TMZ) on glioblastoma cells lines was investigated. A dual
drug-loaded delivery system based on mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) was developed
to potentiate chemotherapy efficacy for glioblastoma. PTX/TMZ-NPs were prepared
with double emulsification solvent evaporation method and exhibited a relatively
uniform diameter of 206.3 ± 14.7 nm. The NPs showed sustained release character.
Cytotoxicity assays showed the best synergistic effects were achieved when the
weight ratios of PTX to TMZ were 1:5 and 1:100 on U87 and C6 cells, respectively.
PTX/TMZ-NPs showed better inhibition effect to U87 and C6 cells than single drug NPs
or free drugs mixture. PTX/TMZ-NPs (PTX: TMZ was 1:5(w/w)) significantly inhibited
the tumor growth in the subcutaneous U87 mice model. These results indicate that
coordinate administration of PTX and TMZ combined with NPs is an efficient method
for glioblastoma.

with temozolomide (TMZ), which could improve
median and 5-year survival significantly [8]. However,
the therapeutic effects of TMZ are far less enough. The
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a
DNA repair protein involved in the resistance of tumor
cells to alkylating agents, is also expressed in glioblastoma
and contributes to the resistance to TMZ [9–11]. Thereby,
combinational administrations of TMZ with other
chemotherapeutics have been under study for improving
the efficacy of glioblastoma therapies [12].
Paclitaxel (PTX) plays a crucial role in various
tumors, as a kind of anti-microtubule drug. It has been
the first-line therapy for patients with breast cancer and
non-small cell lung carcinoma [13, 14]. PTX was reported
a good apoptosis-inducing effect for glioblastoma cells
in vitro [15, 16]. Moreover, the penetrating ability into the
brain tumors of PTX was at least two orders of magnitude
greater than carmustine and 5-fluorouracil, etc. [17].
Given TMZ belongs to cell cycle non-specific
drugs, while PTX is a cell cycle specific drug which

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and
aggressive primary brain tumor [1, 2] with median
survivals only 12-15 months [3, 4]. The treatment is
still worldwide challenging. Given the post-operative
radiotherapy could not prevent its recurrence and
invasiveness towards surrounding brain tissue, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2012
suggested that patients with glioblastoma should consider
chemotherapy except for with pilocytic astrocytoma or
newly diagnosed ependymocytoma. The present treatment
of GBM is multimodal involving surgery, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy [5].
Temozolomide (TMZ) is the first agent in 20 years
approved by the FDA to treat glioblastoma and has been
one of the most commonly used anti-glioma agents with
limited adverse effects [6, 7] due to its ability penetrating
the blood brain barrier (BBB). The standard treatment is
maximal surgical resection and maintenance treatment

could restrain cell cycle at G2/M, we hypothesized
that TMZ and PTX might exhibit synergistic effects
if co-delivered simultaneously. One study indicated
that PTX in combination with an alkylating agent could
synergistically inhibit numerous types of cancers [18].
Particularly, PTX combined with cisplatin or TMZ has
clear synergistic inhibitory effects against malignant
glioblastoma cells in vitro [19]. But there were few reports
on the optimal weight ratios of the two drugs co-delivered.
Furthermore, the water solubility of PTX or TMZ is a
serious limitation [20, 20]. Appropriate strategies were
needed to co-deliver these two drugs effectively to brain.
Among the multiple approaches, polymeric NPs seem
to possess many advantages such as increased drugs
reaching tumor sites, enhanced selectivity and the potential
to co-deliver multiple agents simultaneously.
In this research, we prepared our nanoparticles with
monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol) - poly (D, L-lactideco-glycolide) (mPEG-PLGA). PLGA was approved for
medical applications by FDA as a biocompatible and
biodegradable polymer [21–23]. The mPEG could help
the nanoparticles escape from reticuloendothelial system
phagocytose and prolong its circulation in the bloodstream
and further increase nanoparticles accumulation at the
tumor tissues through the EPR effect [24–26]. We first
determined the optimal weight ratio of PTX to TMZ for
the composite nanoparticles delivery system. Then the
dual drug-loaded mPEG-PLGA NPs was prepared with
a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The
characteristics of the nanoparticles and their cytotoxicity

profiles on U87 human malignant glioblastoma cells and
C6 rat glioma cells were accessed. In vivo anti-tumor
activity was evaluated with a BALB/c subcutaneous U87
glioblastoma xenograft model.

RESULTS
Characteristics of PTX/ TMZ-NPs
The mean size of PTX-NPs was 154.9 ± 21.3 nm
prepared by the emulsion solvent evaporation method.
TMZ-NPs and PTX/TMZ-NPs, prepared with the double
emulsion solvent evaporation technique, achieved an
average diameter of 172.9 ± 10.9 nm and 206.3 ± 14.7
nm (Figure 1A), respectively. The PTX/TMZ-NPs had a
relatively smooth surface and uniform morphology (Figure
1B). The DL and EE of the NPs were listed in Table 1.
The accumulated amount of PTX released from
PTX solution achieved the maximum at 20 h, while from
PTX-NPs or PTX/TMZ-NPs were both near 80 h (Figure
1C), showing apparent sustained characteristic and no
significant difference between the two nanoparticles
groups. Similarly, The TMZ released from the TMZNPs and PTX/TMZ-NPs showed remarkable sustained
feature comparing with TMZ solution (Figure 1D).
We could concluded that drugs-loaded nanoparticles
exhibited a sustained release feature with decreasing
amount of initial release, which might be explained by
that drugs were gradually released with the dissolution
of polymers.

Synergic inhibition of PTX and TMZ on
U87 cells and C6 cells

Significantly different apoptotic rates were observed
among various treatments at 48 h on U87 cells and C6 cells
(Figure 5). Exactly as the proliferation inhibitory results
demonstrated that statistically significant differences not
only existed between single and dual drug groups, but also
among the combined formulations groups, wherein the
apoptosis rate of PTX/TMZ-NPs group was the highest.

As expected, both PTX and TMZ demonstrated
concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on U87 cells
and C6 cells in vitro by MTT assay. The IC50 of PTX and
TMZ for U87 cells at 48 h were 4.5 mg/L and 77.3 mg/L,
respectively. C6 cell line was more sensitive to both the
two drugs. The IC50 values of PTX and TMZ for C6 cells
were 0.1 mg/L and 28.0 mg/L, respectively.
To investigate the synergistic inhibitory effects of
PTX and TMZ, both drugs at different concentrations were
used to simultaneously treat cells based on the IC50 values.
The results showed that TMZ increased the cytotoxicity
of PTX on U87 (Figure 2) and C6 cells (Figure 3). CDI
values were all less than 1, which meant PTX and TMZ
had synergistic effects on both U87 cells and C6 cells.
The combination of PTX and TMZ on the
concentrations of 4.0 mg/L and 20 mg/L, respectively
showed a better synergic effect (lower CDI values) on U87
cells. We speculated that when the ratio of PTX to TMZ
was 1:5(w/w) the synergic effect on U87 was the best.
While the most remarkable synergic effect was observed
on C6 cells when the concentrations were 0.05 mg/L and
5 mg/L, respectively. Therefore, the best synergic effect
on C6 was obtained when the ratio of PTX to TMZ was
1:100(w/w). Nevertheless, increasing the concentrations of
PTX or TMZ further did not yield statistically significant
differences in CDI values.

In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of PTX/TMZ-NPs
In vivo anti-tumor efficacy of PTX/TMZ-NPs was
evaluated on the subcutaneous U87 model. As shown in
Figure 6, the tumor sizes of therapeutic groups were all
notably smaller than that of the control group (P<0.01).
The inhibition effect of PTX/TMZ-NPs was the best.
We also found that effects of dual drug groups were
better than single drug groups, whatever in solution or in
nanoparticles. The nanoparticles groups were better than
PTX/TMZ solution but without significant difference.
These results were in the same trend with the results
in vitro.
However, the significant loss of whole body weight
was observed in PTX or PTX/TMZ group indicating
systemic toxicity (Figure 6B), which was coincident with
other reports (23, 40). However, this did not happen in
NPs groups. We hypothesized that the sustained release
and tumor target of the NPs reduced the side-effects.

DISCUSSION

Combined inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing
effects of PTX and TMZ co-loaded in mPEGPLGA NPs on U87 cells and C6 cells

Combination therapy is a common way of clinical
oncology chemotherapy. Because the TMZ and PTX
produce the antitumor effect by different routes, we
were interested in their combined effect on tumor. In
addition, the two drugs are of water soluble and fat soluble
separately and their encapsulation in NPs can be achieved
by a same method and should not affect each other. It
was reported that glioma cells exhibit decreased glucose
uptake and lactate production in response to treatment
with TMZ; however, glucose metabolism was increased
after Taxol treatment. And the glucose metabolism was
decreased in the TMZ-resistant cells, but was increased in
the Taxol-resistant cells (41). This might be a performance
of synergy. The combination therapy of the two drugs were
reported good effect in a phase I trial on melanoma (42).

Figure 4 indicated that the combined formulations,
including the PTX/TMZ, Mix-NPs or PTX/TMZ-NPs,
all presented synergic effects when incubated with U87
cells and C6 cells, respectively. PTX/TMZ-NPs exhibited
a better synergic effect with statistically significant
differences comparing with Mix-NPs. Nevertheless,
PTX/TMZ-NPs showed significant differences to PTX/
TMZ formulations only at 48 h and 72 h, but not at 24
h, which may be in accordance with the sustained release
characteristic of NPs. The blank mPEG-PLGA NPs did not
have any cytotoxic effects on the both cells.

The coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) was used
to analyze the synergistically inhibitory effect of drug
combinations. The CDI values less than, equal to or
greater than 1 demonstrates that the drugs are synergistic,
additive or antagonistic, respectively. Particularly, CDI
values less than 0.7 indicate the agents are significantly
synergistic [27–29]. A PTX thermo gel depot with TMZ
and radiotherapy was reported on gliosarcoma in vivo
[30]. But the CDI was not calculated. PTX and TMZ
were reported to be co-loaded microsphere on C6 cells
in vitro [31]. The optimal weight ratio was 1:1. While in
our research the optimal ratio was 1:100 on C6 cells. The
difference might be because of the different drug release
rate in nanoparticles and microsphere.
Based on the synergic of the free drugs, we designed
the co-loaded NPs. TMZ is water soluble while PTX is
fat soluble. So we designed a hydrophobic shell with the
PLGA block to capsulate PTX and the aqueous internal
cavities to capsulate TMZ. The mPEG block provided
hydrophilic outer shell for EPR effect. The two drugs

were loaded in different positions of the NPs and their
capsulation did not decrease than single-loaded.
The synergic relationship was observed not only
between drug solutions, but also in co-loaded NPs, singleloaded and their mixture (P<0.05). At 24h, the superiority
of NPs was not obvious. But after 48h, co-loaded NPs
showed better inhibition effect than the mixed solution.
This may be because of the sustained release of the NPs
so that the drug concentration in cells rose more slowly in
NPs groups than in the solution group. But this sustained
release maintained drug concentration in cells for a longer
time to get better inhibition effect. The co-loaded NPs
showed better effect than single-loaded NPs mixture.
We supposed this may be because the single-loaded
NPs amount was larger than the co-loaded NPs at the
same drug concentrations. The cell uptake and efflux is a
reversible process in equilibrium. Thus the large amount
tends to be transported more, so that the drugs in cells
were not equal to the co-loaded NPs group. The detail
reasons will be researched in our future work.

The mPEG block set up hydrophilic outer shell,
which provided long-circulation character and enhanced
NPs distribution in tumor site in vivo than the solution
group [32, 33]. The sustained release characteristic of
nanoparticles is essential not only for improving anticancer efficacy but also for reducing adverse-effects. PTX/
TMZ-NPs would be a promising device for the long-term
delivery of glioblastoma therapy.

TMZ was dissolved in 80 uL of 0.1 M HCl (4.4mg/mL)
and added into 700 μL dichloromethane containing 7mg
mPEG-PLGA. The mixture was emulsified for 120s
(2s-2s-300w) with an ultrasonic processor. Then the initial
emulsion was poured into 5ml 1% F-68 solution quickly
and emulsified again. The emulsion was then stirred at
room temperature to remove the dichloromethane. The
nanoparticles were then collected and freeze-dried for
subsequent use.
The PTX/TMZ-NPs were prepared with the same
double emulsion solvent evaporation method with the
TMZ-NPs. TMZ solution (4.4mg/mL) 80μL was added
into 700 μL dichloromethane containing 7mg mPEGPLGA and PTX (0.1mg/mL). Then the mixture was
emulsified and poured into 5ml 1% F-68 solution and
emulsified again. The dichloromethane was removed by
stirred. The nanoparticles were then collected and freezedried for subsequent use.

Characterization of nanoparticles
The size distribution and average diameters of
PTX/TMZ-NPs were analyzed by Zetasizer IV analyzer
(Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90, UK). The morphology
was observed with Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (H-800; Hitachi, Japan).
The concentration of PTX was determined by
HPLC (Agilent 1200, USA) with a C18 chromatographic
column (Zorbax SB-C18, 150×4.6 mm, 5 μm). The
mobile phase was acetonitrile: 10 mmol/L NH4Ac
solution (pH=5.0) 53:47 at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
and the detection wavelength was 227 nm [38, 39].
The TMZ was monitored at a wavelength of 328 nm
using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV9000,
AoYi Instrument Co., Ltd.) [20]. The free PTX was
separated by centrifuge (5000r/min × 5min) and the
precipitate was removed. The free TMZ was separated
by ultracentrifugation (MWCO=10kDa) and the solution
was collected as free TMZ. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) and Drug Loading rate (DL) were calculated as

intravenously administered respectively with 200 μL of
saline, PTX, TMZ, PTX/TMZ, PTX-NPs, TMZ-NPs or
PTX/TMZ-NPs, at the dose of PTX 4 mg/kg [40, 43] and
TMZ 20 mg/kg [44]. The treatments were repeated every
two days. Tumor size was used to assess the efficacy of
therapy. Two perpendicular diameters were measured with
a caliper every three days until the mice were sacrificed.
The tumor volume (V) was calculated as:

C6 cells and U87 cells were cultured in DMEM
medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% (v/v)
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% antibiotic  solution (penicillin 100 U/mL and
streptomycin 100 μg/mL) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2.
U87 cells and C6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and cultured overnight. The medium was replaced with
a series of concentrations of PTX (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5,
5, 7.5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 50 mg/L) or TMZ (1, 2.5, 5, 10,
25, 50, 75, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1500 mg/L) respectively.
After further cultured for 24/48/72 hours, the medium was
changed with fresh DMEM with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for
another 4 h. The resulting formazan was dissolved in 200
μL of DMSO and detected at 490 nm using a Microplate
Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA, USA).
The relative growth rate of the cells (RGR %) was
determined by the following equation:

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

U87 cells and C6 cells were plated in 12-well plates
respectively and cultured overnight. The medium in the
wells were refreshed and PTX or TMZ preparations were
added in for 48 h. Then, the wells were divided into two
parts. One part was changed with fresh DMEM with MTT
and detected as above. The other wells were treated under
instructions of apoptosis detection Kit (Annexin V-FITC,
Byotime Co., Ltd.) and detected with a flow cytometry.
The treatments were performed in triplicate, and the
percentage of labeled cells undergoing apoptosis in each
group was determined and calculated.
