BACKGROUND. Surgical removal and radiation therapy are associated with significant risk for morbidity in the pediatric population with craniopharyngioma.
Intracystic therapies have been utilized in some centers to potentially decrease
morbidity associated with cystic craniopharyngioma. The aim of the study was to
review the Canadian experience with intracystic bleomycin therapy (ICB).

METHODS. All centers in the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium
(CPBTC) were invited to participate in a retrospective review of this treatment. A
questionnaire was sent to each center. The data were analyzed at British Columbia’s Children’s Hospital.

RESULTS. In all, 6 of 17 centers utilized ICB and submitted data. A total of 17 of

total resection, recurrence rates vary between 5% and
50%.3,4 After subtotal resections, up to 70% of patients
develop disease progression.5 After combination surgery and radiation therapy, disease progression or recurrence occurs in up to 20% of patients at 10 years
and 46% at 20 years.6–9 Craniopharyngioma has an
intimate relation with the internal carotid arteries;
anterior cerebral arteries; the pituitary gland; the
hypothalamus; and the optic nerves, chiasm, and
tracts. Conventional therapies of surgery and radiation individually or in combination may be associated
with considerable immediate and long-term side
effects, including visual loss, endocrine dysfunction,
hypothalamic dysfunction, cerebral infarction, moyamoya syndrome, cognitive dysfunction, and epilepsy.
One of the characteristics of craniopharyngiomas
is the presence of single or multiple cysts, which can
account for 80% to 90% of the total bulk of the
tumor.10 Sixty-nine percent of evaluated patients
have mainly cystic tumors.11 For the patients with
predominantly cystic craniopharyngiomas there is
the potential for intracystic treatment, either using
chemotherapy with bleomycin; immunotherapy with
interferon-a;12 or radioisotope therapy13,14 with P32,
yttrium90, or I131. To our knowledge, the role of these
intratumoral modalities and more specifically the
role of intracystic bleomycin (ICB) have not been
well defined. The experience with ICB in the treatment of craniopharyngioma in children is limited
and reported anecdotally or at the institutional level,
raising questions regarding bias pertaining to published experience. The aim of this study was to
review the Canadian experience and identify technical issues, outcomes, and complications associated
with treating children with cystic craniopharyngioma
with ICB (received from Faulding (Canada) Inc., Kirkland,
Québec, Canada).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All centers in the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumor
Consortium (CPBTC) were invited to participate in a
retrospective review of the use of intratumoral bleomycin in patients with craniopharyngioma up to
2003, with the most recent follow-up extending to
2004. After ethics board approval at each participating
center, a questionnaire was sent to each center.
Informed consent to treatment was obtained from all
patients and guardians before treatment. All patients
with a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma were reviewed
in detail for patient age at diagnosis, cyst number and
size, location of calcification if present, location of
craniopharyngioma, previous therapy, clinical status,
complications of catheter insertion, dosage of bleo-

mycin, complications of bleomycin, response to
bleomycin, subsequent therapy required for craniopharyngioma, and overall survival. A course of bleomycin was considered to be repeated doses of ICB, the frequency of which varied from daily to weekly. The
dosage was noted, the total mg of bleomycin per kg
per week was calculated, and the estimated concentration of bleomycin in the cyst at each instillation
was also determined. Complications of bleomycin
were graded according to the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (CTCAE).15
The baseline scan was considered as the imaging
study performed before bleomycin instillation and
postinsertion of catheter. All patients had follow-up
scans performed at the end of a course of bleomycin
and at regular intervals subsequently. The measurements were performed by the investigator at each
center. Response and progression criteria of the cystic
and solid components were classified as follows:
minor response (MR), >25% decrease in size; partial
response (PR), >50% decrease; complete response
(CR), >90% decrease; and disease progression, >25%
increase in size or clinical deterioration due to increase in tumor size requiring intervention. The data
were analyzed at British Columbia Children’s Hospital.

RESULTS
Patient Population
Of the 17 centers in the Canadian Pediatric Consortium, 1 center had utilized ICB since 1995. In
another 5 centers, ICB was utilized from 1999, 2000,
and 2001. At 6 centers, there were a total of 42
children diagnosed with craniopharyngioma in the
aforementioned time period. Of the 19 children with
intention to treat, 17 actually received bleomycin
therapy. Two patients (1 who was newly diagnosed
and 1 who was studied after the failure of first-line
therapy) had an intracystic catheter inserted, but on
injection of contrast into the catheter there was leakage of contrast outside the cyst noted on computed
tomography (CT) and therefore no bleomycin was
instilled. One of these children was found to have
communication between the ventricular system and
the cyst. Twelve patients were treated with bleomycin
at the time of diagnosis and 5 were treated after
failing first-line therapy. ICB was not considered at
the time of diagnosis in 29 of 42 of these patients
because they were older, the risk of surgical resection
was considered low, or the tumor was mainly solid.
The median age at the time of bleomycin therapy
was 6 years (range, 1–14 years); there were 10 female
and 7 male patients. Eleven of the 17 patients had
tumors with a single cyst. There was a wide variation

in the volume of the cyst. The median estimated volume of the largest cyst for each patient was 58 mL
(range, 2.5–296 mL) (Table 1). A total of 9 of the 17
patients had tumors with a calcified cyst wall. The
solid component was small, measuring 1 cm in
greatest dimension in 14 patients, and the maximum
dimension of the solid component was 2 cm. This
reflects the selection bias of suitable patients by the
treating centers, based on previous publications
reporting the benefit of ICB in tumors that were
mainly cystic.16 A total of 16 of 17 patients had tumors
with a suprasellar retrochiasmatic component.

Catheter Insertion
In 18 of the 19 children with intention-to-treat with
bleomycin, a catheter was inserted to drain the cyst
and allow bleomycin treatment, without any attempt
at resecting the tumor. The approach used to insert

the catheter was subfrontal in 8 patients; transcortical in 4 patients; transcortical transventricular in 3
patients; and transphenoidal, bicoronal endoscopic,
and pterional in the remaining 3 patients, respectively. One patient underwent a subtotal resection
at the same time that the catheter was inserted.
Complications of the catheter insertion occurred in
7 of 19 patients and included acute epidural and
intraventricular hemorrhage in a patient with a previously undiagnosed coagulation defect, intracystic
blood (2 patients), fluid collection outside the cyst
(1 patient), and contrast leakage on postoperative CT
scan after instillation of contrast into the cyst
(3 patients). All the children were tested for leakage
outside of the cyst at least 1 week after catheter
insertion, before bleomycin administration; this CT
scan also provided the baseline for determining cyst
size before bleomycin therapy. One child with leak-

2127

age had a follow-up CT scan with contrast 1 week
later that showed resolution of leakage; the patient
then underwent bleomycin therapy. Five children
required revision of their catheter or reservoir up to
21 months after the initial insertion.

Bleomycin Therapy
Bleomycin was administered intracystically via a
subgaleal reservoir, as previously described.17 The
dosage of bleomycin, clinical changes after bleomycin, and radiologic responses to bleomycin are summarized in Table 1. Treatment protocols varied
between centers, with most following a MondayWednesday-Friday regimen. None of the patients
received daily ICB. Bleomycin was administered as a
course lasting an average length of 4 weeks (range,
2–15 weeks). The median dose per course was 36 mg
(range, 15–75 mg). Five patients received more than
1 course of bleomycin. The median dose per instillation was 3 mg (range, 2–5 mg), and the median dose
per week was 9 mg (range, 4–20 mg). The median
dose of a single injection in terms of concentration
within the cyst was 0.09 mg/mL/dose (range, 0.01–
2 mg/mL/dose).
A CR was achieved in 5 patients, as exemplified
by 1 patient whose CT scans are shown in Figure 1.
Only 1 of these patients received a dose lower than
the median of the whole group. Six patients achieved
a PR, 5 achieved a MR, and 1 patient remained with
stable disease (SD) for 2.8 years. In this latter group
of patients (PR, MR, and SD), 50% received a dose of
bleomycin that was below the median in terms of
mg/mL/dose and of these patients who received a
lower concentration of bleomycin, 66% developed
disease progression within a year.
Among the 17 patients treated with ICB there
were 4 adverse events believed to be most likely
attributable to ICB. Transient symptomatic peritumoral edema occurred in 2 patients. One presented
with a decreased level of consciousness and was
treated with supportive care and steroids in the
intensive care unit; the edema resolved but she developed long-term panhypopituitarism. The second
patient presented with multiple cranial nerve deficits
and hemiparesis. She was noted to also have cyst
reaccumulation in the cerebellopontine angle with
brainstem compression that required revision of the
catheter/reservoir system and supportive care. She
had residual third nerve pareses, hemiparesis, and
decreased attention long-term. One child developed
precocious puberty in spite of cyst shrinkage
5 months later and 1 was noted to have panhypopituitarism at 2 years in spite of persistent resolution
of the cyst. None of our patients developed second-

ary visual dysfunction directly due to the bleomycin
and 4 experienced visual improvement after the
bleomycin therapy.
Two patients developed moyamoya syndrome
several years later, 1 due to tumor infiltration into
the anterior cerebral arteries (5 years postradiation)
and the other secondary to radiation therapy given
4.5 years previously, when the child was 8 years of
age. One patient developed hyperpigmentation over
bony prominences, which was considered a systemic
side effect of bleomycin. The 1 patient who had
long-term neurotoxicity potentially secondary at least
in part to bleomycin had received the highest dose
of bleomycin in terms of mg/week, mg/kg/week, and
the second highest estimated concentration of bleomycin in the cyst.
In 3 patients who underwent surgical resection
for progression after ICB, the pathology of the tumor
was reviewed with a special focus on unusual features related to bleomycin. There were only the usual
features of normal thin-walled vessels in the gliotic
brain adjacent to the craniopharyngioma. The pathology was reviewed in 1 patient after both bleomycin and radiation and there were the expected
changes after radiation with fibrous tissue replacement of blood vessel walls and Rosenthal fibers in
adjacent gliotic brain.

Subsequent Therapy
Eight patients required no further intervention after
a single course of bleomycin. Two patients underwent a second course of bleomycin only at the time
of cyst recurrence. Thus, 10 patients have been treated with bleomycin alone and have been followed for
a median of 21 years (range, 0.5–6.11 years). A sustained benefit of >1 year was observed in 11 of 17
patients for a median of 3.6 years (range, 1.6–
9.3 years) before another modality of therapy was
required. One patient progressed within 3 months
and underwent a subtotal resection. Two patients
developed disease progression and received involved
field radiation therapy. Five patients received subsequent multimodality therapy including bleomycin
(3 patients), resection (5 patients), and radiation
therapy (5 patients). Radiation therapy was delayed
by a median of 3.6 years (range, 0.2–9.3 years).
Survival
The median progression-free survival for patients
treated at the time of diagnosis with ICB was
0.7 years (range, 0.3–6.1 years) with a median overall
survival of 5 years (range, 0.5–10.2 years). A single
patient died; this death was secondary to a massive

middle cerebral artery territory infarct secondary to
moyamoya syndrome 4–5 years after radiation therapy. The median progression-free survival for
patients treated at the time of recurrence with ICB
was 2 years (range, 0.6–4 years), with a median overall survival of 21 years (range, 0.6–5.51 years); none
of these patients had died at the time of last followup, but the follow-up period was relatively short.

DISCUSSION
In spite of the benign histology of craniopharyngioma, it can behave aggressively.18 The 10-year overall
survival is 64% to 92%, which is consistent with the
benign histology, regardless of whether the tumor is
treated in a surgically aggressive manner or with
radiotherapy or a multimodality approach.19–21 However, the acute and long-term morbidity of childhood
craniopharyngioma remains substantial, with nearly
universal multiple endocrinopathies, visual loss reported in up to 75% of patients, severe postsurgical
obesity, a high prevalence of neurocognitive sequelae, and up to 20% of patients reported to develop
neurologic motor deficits or a seizure disorder.20–24
The risks of radiation to the developing brain are
much higher, thus creating the need for avoiding this
modality in younger children or at least delaying its
use. Therefore, a permanent obliteration of the cyst
or at least a transient shrinkage could be a valuable
contribution to therapy in the child with cystic
craniopharyngioma. ICB has been utilized in selected
cases as part of a multimodality approach, particularly in the younger child who is at greatest risk
of complications from aggressive surgery and
radiation therapy, and also in recurring cystic craniopharyngioma.
To our knowledge, the literature to date regarding the use of ICB for craniopharyngioma is limited
to case reports or individual center retrospective
series and 1 small prospective study of 5 patients.
The largest series published to date included 26
patients (20 children and 6 adults) from a single center. None of these reports have provided a current
review of the literature, a multiinstitutional perspective, or details of the concentration of dose within
the cyst, or correlated dose to response rate; therefore, we believe the current study adds valuable
information.
On review of the literature of 70 adult and pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma who were
treated with ICB, it is reported to be effective in
inducing at least >25% cystic shrinkage in up to 90%
of patients, and a CR in 50% of patients. Approximately 50% of patients were successfully treated with

Intracystic Bleomycin: Craniopharyngioma/Hukin et al.

bleomycin alone at a mean follow-up of 5 years
(range, 0.2–16 years).12,16,17,25–33
The results in our pediatric population at a median follow-up of 5 years (range, 0.5–10.2 years) are
in keeping with the previously published experience:
94% had at least 25% shrinkage and 29% achieved a
CR. In all, 59% were successfully treated with bleomycin alone; 2 patients underwent a repeat course of
bleomycin and the median progression-free survival
was 2 years (range, 0.5–6.11 years). However, the
duration of benefit was <1 year in 41% of patients,
leading to more definitive therapy in 30% within
1 year. A sustained benefit of >1 year was noted in
11 of 17 patients for a median of 3.6 years (range,
1.6–9.3 years) before another modality of therapy
was required, thus potentially decreasing the risks of
morbidity of radiation and/or surgery. Only 1 of
9 patients with a calcified cyst had a CR; this may be
an adverse factor for cyst collapse after bleomycin
therapy. In addition, our comprehensive data collection suggests that at least one-third of pediatric craniopharyngioma patients present with cystic tumors
that are amenable to this treatment approach.
Based on our experience and the review of the
literature, it appears that dosing is complicated and
does not neatly correlate with response. Our findings
suggest a lower chance of significant cyst shrinkage
and shorter duration of response if the patient
received <9 mg/wk and 0.09 mg/mL/dose. However,
we have observed that this tumor behaves in a heterogeneous manner: some large cysts will disappear
with a small dose of bleomycin and small cysts may
only have an MR with a higher dose. Two of 5
patients who underwent a second course of bleomycin have not required any further intervention at the
time of last follow-up, suggesting that this may be a
reasonable tactic in those who are young, in whom
surgical and radiation risks of morbidity are high.
Alternate-day dosing appears safe; our data suggest
concentration and weekly dose may be important,
but no one really knows the optimal individual dose.
Rarely reported complications include blindness in
1 patient related to incorrect dilution31; sensorineural
hearing loss,26 likely a direct toxic effect secondary to
reservoir communication with cerebrospinal fluid;
single reports of long-term hypothalamic dysfunction,27 focal ischemia,26 and seizure with hemiparesis28; and death possibly related to a high individual
and cumulative dose, and daily dosage scheme over
a short period (daily dose over 8 days, for a total of
56 mg).32 In our experience 12% of children developed transient grade 3–4 neurotoxicity, 1 developed
residual panhypopituitarism, and another patient
developed a residual hemiparesis and third nerve

2129

pareses. One child developed precocious puberty and
a fourth child developed panhypopituitarism possibly
secondary to the bleomycin treatment.
The effects of ICB on future surgical resection, if
required, are unclear. In the 3 cases reviewed by our
neuropathologist, there were no unusual features of
the tumor or its vasculature. An autopsy was performed on 1 of the patients reported by Takahashi
et al.16 This patient had a huge mixed tumor and
Rosenthal fibers and microcapillary congestion was
observed in the normal brain adjacent to the tumor,
whereas no prominent necrotic foci were found.
To our knowledge, there are 2 reports describing
the use of ICB for craniopharyngioma followed by
radiation. Jiang et al28 describe 9 patients receiving
5–15 mg of ICB daily over 8 days followed by intracystic P32 at a dose of 200 grays. Three adults had
severe sequelae: fatigue; hyponatremia, adephagia
obesity, thalamic infarction, and death. Nicolata
et al.33 reported the treatment of 8 patients with
bleomycin followed by gamma knife radiosurgery. All
patients had at least a 50% reduction in tumor size;
1 patient died 44 months later secondary to diffuse
ventriculitis. The daily dosage of bleomycin with
adjuvant radiation may be associated with greater
toxicity. Our patient who developed radiationinduced moyamoya syndrome received the radiation
within 10 months of the bleomycin therapy. It is
unclear whether the bleomycin was a contributing
factor because the vasculopathy became symptomatic 4.5 years after radiation. Moyamoya syndrome
is a well-recognized complication of radiation to
the suprasellar region; the vast majority of patients
are children.34 We observed a benefit in our population who received bleomycin in terms of radiation
deferral.
The limitations of this study are inherent due to
the retrospective nature. They include selection bias
based on each institution’s philosophy and experience; the mix of newly diagnosed and recurrent
patients at the time of ICB therapy; variability in the
dosage of bleomycin and the frequency of each
instillation; and the relatively short follow-up in
some patients.

CONCLUSIONS
ICB was found to be well tolerated in the majority of
children in this retrospective review. The untoward
effects were minor in most instances, and in those
patients who developed more severe consequences
the long-term repercussions appear to be less severe
than those of aggressive surgery or radiation therapy
in the young child. A minority of children with newly

2130

CANCER

diagnosed craniopharyngioma may be suitable for
this therapy. ICB might be considered in selected
cases: mainly cystic lesions, in children age <10 years
at the time of diagnosis, and for lesions that are of
high risk of serious surgical morbidity (eg, retrochiasmatic hypothalamic lesions). This treatment can also
be considered for cystic recurrence after standard
therapy. In our series, a dose >15 mg/wk or 0.9 mg/
kg/wk or 1 mg/mL/dose was associated with greater
toxicity. Delivering therapy on alternate days may
maximize efficacy and minimize serious complications. Adjuvant radiotherapy may increase the risks
of serious complications. It is important to ensure no
leakage before bleomycin administration. Bleomycin
may delay the need for aggressive surgery or radiation therapy for several years. Bleomycin appears to
be a useful alternative in the treatment of cystic
craniopharyngioma occurring in children, but prospective clinical trials are required to evaluate this
further. The results of the current study provide the
basis for a future prospective multiinstitutional study
of childhood cystic craniopharyngioma. In view of
the side effect profile, other drugs should also be
considered in the treatment of this disease.
