ABSTRACT
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
(IGF-1R) both overexpressed on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are known
cooperatively to promote tumor progression and drug resistance. This study was
to construct a novel bispecific fusion protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE consisting of EGFR
and IGF-IR specific ligands (EGF and IGF-1) and lidamycin, an enediyne antibiotic
with potent antitumor activity, and investigate its antitumor efficacy against NSCLC.
Binding and internalization assays showed that EGF-IGF-LDP protein could bind to
NSCLC cells with high affinity and then internalized into cells with higher efficiency
than that of monospecific proteins. In vitro, the enediyne-energized analogue of
bispecific fusion protein (EGF-IGF-LDP-AE) displayed extremely potent cytotoxicity
to NSCLC cell lines with IC50<10-11 mol/L. Moreover, the bispecific protein EGF-IGFLDP-AE was more cytotoxic than monospecific proteins (EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGFAE) and lidamycin. In vivo, EGF-IGF-LDP-AE markedly inhibited the growth of A549
xenografts, and the efficacy was more potent than that of lidamycin and monospecific
counterparts. EGF-IGF-LDP-AE caused significant cell cycle arrest and it also induced
cell apoptosis in a dosage-dependent manner. Pretreatment with EGF-IGF-LDP-AE
inhibited EGF-, IGF-stimulated EGFR and IGF-1R phosphorylation, and blocked two
main downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK activation. These data suggested
that EGF-LDP-IGF-AE protein would be a promising targeted agent for NSCLC patients
with EGFR and/or IGF-1R overexpression.

(NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung
cancers, with this encompassing the pathologically
distinct adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and
large cell carcinoma types. Despite recent advances in

chemotherapy, the global mortality rate of unresectable or
metastatic NSCLC remains high, and the 5-year overall
survival rate is less than 15% [1–3].
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) have been identified
as promising therapeutic targets in NSCLC. EGFR, a
member of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, is known to
play important roles in promoting cell survival, proliferation,
differentiation, migration and angiogenesis when activated
by ligand (EGF, TGF-α, etc) binding [4]. Cetuximab,
gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib, these monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) or small tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which
targeting EGFR have shown improved survival for patients
with NSCLC compared with standard chemotherapy
[5–8]. But tumors generally develop resistance to them
within a few months, thereby limits the clinical efficacy of
monospecific targeted therapy [9–11]. Results from many
studies indicated that cross-talk between EGFR and IGF-1R
may be one of the reasons for acquired resistance against
EGFR-targeted drugs [12–15]. Insulin-like growth factor
(IGF) signaling system which consisted of ligands (IGF-1
and IGF-2), growth factor receptors (IGF-1R, IGF-2R) and
IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs 1-6), also has been implicated
in the development, maintenance, and progression of cancer
[16]. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are structurally related to insulin
and they play a role in regulating cell growth, proliferation,
transformation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.
The physiological activities of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are
modulated by their association with IGFBPs [17]. IGF-1R
is a glycoprotein composed of two extracellular α subunits
that bind IGF-1 preferentially and with lesser affinity to IGF2 and insulin. The two β subunits contain the tyrosine kinase
domain responsible for activation the two main downstream
signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT pathway and Ras/MAPK
pathway) that promote cell growth, transformation,
migration, and survival [12, 16, 17]. Therapeutic strategies
targeting IGF-1R, including the use of mAbs, TKIs, and
IGF ligand neutralizing antibodies have been explored in
preclinical studies. They inhibited the growth of IGF-IR
expressing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, and enhance
responses of cancer cells to treatments with cytotoxic drugs
or radiotherapy [18–25].
Overexpression of EGFR has been observed in a
number of solid tumors, including 40% to 80% of NSCLC
[26, 27]. High IGF-1R expression was also occurred
in NSCLC and was associated with poor survival, and
elevated plasma levels of IGF-1 have been associated with
an increased risk of the disease [28]. Furthermore, a study
has revealed that overexpression of both EGFR and IGF-1R
was observed in 24.8% of 125 surgical NSCLC patients, and
high co-expression of EGFR and IGF-1R was a significant
prognostic factor of worse disease-free survival (DFS) [29].
A number of bispecific antibodies targeting both EGFR
and IGF-1R (EI-04, XGFR) have demonstrated superior
antitumor activity to corresponding monospecific antibodies
[30–32], but the researches on ligand-based EGFR/IGF1R bispecific fusion protein have not been reported yet.

Antibody-drug conjugates or ligand-toxin fusion proteins
taking advantage of the specificity of antibodies or ligands
and the potent cytotoxic activity of toxins are an emerging
novel class of anticancer treatment agents. Trastuzumab
emtansine (T-DM1) consisting of trastuzumab coupled to
a cytotoxic agent, emtansine (DM1), and DAB(389)IL-2
(denileukin diftitox, ONTAK) made up of the full-length
IL-2 molecule and the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin
have approved by FDA and shown significant efficacy and
safety in treating patients with advanced breast cancer and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, respectively [33, 34].
In this study, we firstly report the construction and
functional characterization of a ligand-based EGFR/IGF-1R bispecific fusion protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE. As
shown, EGF and IGF-1, the natural ligands with high
affinity to EGFR and IGF-1R were used as targeting
moiety, and an enediyne antibiotic, lidamycin, was used as
cytotoxic payload. Lidamycin (C-1027) showed extremely
potent cytotoxicity to various cancer cells and exhibited
marked inhibitory effects on a panel of xenografts in
athymic mice. Lidamycin consists of two moieties, an
active enediyne chromophore (AE) responsible for the
extremely potent cytotoxicity and a noncovalently bound
apoprotein (LDP), which forms a hydrophobic pocket
for protecting the chromophore. The apoprotein and
chromophore can be dissociated and reconstituted in
vitro [35]. Thus, EGF and IGF-1 were fused to the LDP
to obtain the fusion protein EGF-IGF-LDP firstly, and
then the AE of lidamycin was integrated into the EGFIGF-LDP to prepare the enediyne-energized fusion protein
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE. This research measured the antitumor
activity of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE on NSCLC, and compared
the potency of bispecific fusion protein with lidamycin and
its monospecific counterparts, EGF-LDP-AE and LDPIGF-AE. The aim of this study was to confirm whether a
bispecific fusion protein targeting both EGFR and IGF-1R
offers a superior antitumor efficacy against NSCLC.

RESULTS
Construction, expression and purification of
fusion proteins and their enediyne-energized
analogues
The DNA sequence coding for bispecific protein
EGF-IGF-LDP (from 5’-end to 3’-end) consisted of
human egf gene (159 bp), (GGGGS)2 linker (30 bp),
human igf-1 gene (210 bp), (GGGGS)2 linker (30 bp) and
gene of apoprotein of lidamycin (ldp, 330 bp). Another
bispecific fusion protein EGF-LDP-IGF that differed in the
location of the ldp from EGF-IGF-LDP was constructed
for comparison. Monospecific EGF-LDP protein which
contains human egf gene, (GGGGS)2 linker and ldp gene,
and LDP-IGF protein which contains ldp gene, (GGGGS)2
linker, and human igf-1 gene were also synthesized
(Figure 1A). The results from protein localization analysis
revealed that EGF-LDP was soluble protein whereas

EGF-IGF-LDP, EGF-LDP-IGF and LDP-IGF proteins
were located in the insoluble fractions (Figure 1B, 1C).
A (His)6-tag was introduced at the COOH terminal of all
the fusion proteins, therefore, they were purified by Ni2+
affinity chromatography. The purity of fusion proteins
were all over 90% when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure
1D), and the production of EGF-LDP-IGF, EGF-IGF-LDP,
EGF-LDP, and LDP-IGF was 36, 50, 53 and 12 mg/L
fermentation broth, respectively. The enediyne-energized
analogues of fusion proteins (EGF-IGF-LDP-AE, EGFLDP-IGF-AE, EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE) were
prepared by integrating AE molecule of lidamycin into the
four fusion proteins (Figure 1E).

cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of
FITC-labeled fusion proteins, and the mean fluorescence
intensities (MFIs) correspondingly increased (Figure
2B). Furthermore, the MFIs were linear with the
concentration of FITC-labeled fusion proteins within
the range of 0 nmol/L - 1 μmol/L (Supplementary Figure
1). Monospecific EGF-LDP protein and bispecific EGFLDP-IGF, EGF-IGF-LDP protein showed similar high
affinities to NSCLC cells, whereas LDP-IGF showed
a significantly decreased affinity. For example, in H520
cells, the concentrations of EGF-LDP/FITC, EGF-LDPIGF/FITC and EGF-IGF-LDP/FITC were 159.7 nmol/L,
165.5 nmol/L and 120 nmol/L, respectively, when the
MFIs=100. However, the concentration of LDP-IGF/
FITC was 449.8 nmol/L when the MFI=100, which is 3.7
times that of EGF-IGF-LDP. To determine whether the
binding affinity of fusion proteins to NSCLC cells was
correlated with the EGFR and IGF-1R expression levels,
the expression of EGFR and IGF-1R on NSCLC cells was
detected by Western blot analysis (Figure 2C), and twoway analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni posttests were carried out among the MFIs of A549, H460 and
H520 cells (Prism 5 software). The results showed that the

MFIs of EGF-IGF-LDP to A549 and H520 cells with high
levels of EGFR and IGF-1R was significantly higher than
that of H460 cells with low EGFR and IGF-1R expression
(p < 0.05, Supplementary Figure 2). This proved that the
binding affinity of the EGF-IGF-LDP protein to NSCLC
cells was related to EGFR and IGF-1R expression levels.

From the results of flow cytometry-based
internalization assay, we found that when incubated with
A549 or H520 cells at 37°C for 1 h or 2 h, more EGF-IGFLDP protein was internalized into cells than that of EGFLDP and LDP-IGF proteins (Figure 2D). The increased

protein may contribute to its enhanced cytotoxicity.

because of the interactions between the fusion proteins
and their concentration, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s
multiple comparison tests of the IC50 values revealed that
there were significant differences between EGF-IGFLDP-AE and EGF-LDP-AE in A549 and H520 cells (not
significant in H460 and H1299 cells). The differences
between EGF-IGF-LDP-AE and another monospecific
fusion protein LDP-IGF-AE were not statistically
significant for all 4 ESCC cell lines (Figure 3B). EGFIGF-LDP-AE also showed more potent cytotoxicity than
another bispecific fusion protein EGF-LDP-IGF-AE
except in H460 cells. As a result, EGF-IGF-LDP-AE was
used in the following experiments.
The fusion proteins EGF-LDP, EGF-LDP-IGF and
EGF-IGF-LDP without active enediyne chromophore did
not exhibit significant cytotoxicity to A549 cells even

Cytotoxicity of fusion proteins and their
enediyne-energized analogues to NSCLC cells
As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, the enediyneenergized analogues of four fusion proteins EGF-LDP-AE,
LDP-IGF-AE, EGF-LDP-IGF-AE and EGF-IGF-LDP-AE
displayed extremely potent cytotoxicity to NSCLC cell
lines A549, H460, H520 and H1299. Moreover, two-way
ANOVA analysis revealed that, except for the cytotoxicity
between EGF-IGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE in A549
cells, the bispecific proteins EGF-IGF-LDP-AE was more
cytotoxic than monospecific proteins (EGF-LDP-AE
and LDP-IGF-AE) and lidamycin (p < 0.05). However,

at 100 μg/mL. However, the LDP-IGF protein showed
an inhibition rate of 37.6% and 43.4% at 50 μg/mL and
100 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 3C). MTT assays were
also done comparing A549 cells treated with bispecific
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE with cells treated with an equimolar
concentration of mixed EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE
to determine if the increased cytotoxicity of bispecific
proteins was due to the presence of the EGF and IGF-1 on
the same single-chain molecule. The result showed that
bispecific EGF-IGF-LDP-AE was more potent than that
of the mixture of EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE, but the
difference was not significant (p > 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure 3).

nmol/L of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE treatment for H520 cells,
and with 0.05 nmol/L of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE treatment
for H460 cells. The proportion of apoptotic and necrotic
cells increased markedly after treatment with higher
concentrations of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE, therefore the G2/M
phase arrest was not significant as treatment with lower
concentrations of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE.
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assays revealed that
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE treatment caused significant apoptosis
of NSCLC cells in a dosage-dependent manner. As shown
in Figure 4B, the ratios of apoptotic H520 cells after
exposure to 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 nmol/L of EGF-IGF-LDPAE were 28.27% ± 4.01%, 39.17% ± 6.45%, 47.38% ±
4.29%, and 54.6% ± 4.17%, respectively, which showed
significant increases compared with control (6.6% ±
0.92%, p < 0.01). The apoptotic cells also increased a lot
for the A549 cells and H460 cells after treatment with
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE (Figure 4B).

Effects of bispecific enediyne-energized fusion
protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE on the cell cycle
distribution and cell apoptosis
After treatment with EGF-IGF-LDP-AE for 48
h, the cell cycle distribution of NSCLC cells altered
significantly which the cells were arrested at G2/M phase.
For example, control cells (A549) distributed in G2/M
phase was 6.77% ± 1.8%, whereas cells treated with 0.01,
0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 nmol/L of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE distributed
in G2/M phase were 9.73% ± 8.35%, 40.77% ± 9.99%,
47.09% ± 6.17% and 49.05% ± 2.98%, respectively.
Similar results were also observed in H520 cells and
H460 cells after exposure to EGF-IGF-LDP-AE (Figure
4A). But the G2/M phase cells reached the peak with 0.1

Effects of enediyne-energized fusion proteins on
the EGFR/IGF-1R signaling pathways
EGFR and IGF-1R are two important receptor
tyrosine kinases involved in cell growth and survival
control by activating the two main signaling pathways:
the PI3K-AKT pathway and Ras-MAPK pathway.
Consequently, the effects of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE on the
phosphorylation of EGFR and IGF-1R and the activation
of two major downstream signaling molecules AKT and

p44/p42 MAP kinases (ERK) were evaluated on A549
cells either stimulated or not with EGF and/or IGF-1.
Incubation of A549 cells with EGF resulted in significant
increased phosphorylation levels of EGFR, IGF-1R and
ERK, while IGF-1 treatment could activate the IGF-1R,
AKT and ERK. A significant increase in phospho-EGFR,
phospho-IGF-1R, phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK was
also observed in the presence of both EGF and IGF-1
(Figure 5A, lanes 2 - 4). Pretreatment with EGF-IGFLDP-AE (0.1 nmol/L) for 12 h did not block EGF- and
IGF-stimulated EGFR and IGF-1R phosphorylation, but
their phosphorylation levels markedly reduced when
exposure time extended to 24 h and 48 h. The activation of
downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK was also
strongly inhibited by the treatment with EGF-IGF-LDPAE for 24 h and 48 h. However, treatment with EGF-IGFLDP-AE had no effect on the total expression levels of
EGFR and IGF-1R as well as AKT and ERK (Figure 5A).
The effects of mono-specific fusion proteins
EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE on the EGFR/IGF-1R
signaling pathways were also evaluated. As shown in
Figure 5B, A549 cells treated with EGF-LDP-AE for 12
h, 24 h and 48 h resulted in the inhibition of EGF- and
IGF- stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR. LDP-IGFAE pretreatment for 48 h could also inhibit the activation
of EGFR. Phosphorylation of IGF-1R was not affected
by the treatment of EGF-LDP-AE, but LDP-IGF-AE
treatment for 24 h and 48 h caused the significant decrease
of phospho-IGF-1R. Activation of AKT was suppressed
when exposure to EGF-LDP-AE for 24 h and LDP-IGFAE for 24 h, 48 h. Phospho-ERK was also reduced after

exposure to EGF-LDP-AE for 48 h and LDP-IGF-AE for
12 h, 24 h, 48 h (Figure 5B). Similar with the bispecific
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE protein, two mono-specific fusion
proteins did not show any effects on the total levels of
EGFR, IGF-1R, AKT and ERK.

In vivo efficacy of enediyne-energized fusion
proteins
The in vivo efficacy of bispecific EGF-IGF-LDPAE and monospecific EGF-LDP-AE, LDP-IGF-AE
were tested in an A549 xenografts nude mouse model.
Mice bearing established xenografts of ~100 mm3 were
treated with lidamycin, EGF-LDP-IGF-AE, EGF-LDPAE and LDP-IGF-AE twice by intravenous injections.
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE at 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg both
yielded significant tumor growth inhibition (69.7% and
80.5%, respectively; p < 0.01 compared with the PBStreated group, p < 0.05 between two different dosages).
Furthermore, the EGF-IGF-LDP-AE-treated group at
0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg showed more potent growth
inhibition when compared with lidamycin-treated group
at maximum tolerated dosage (0.05 mg/kg, inhibition rate,
59.4%, p < 0.01). The monospecific enediyne-energized
fusion proteins EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE (at 0.4
mg/kg) demonstrated similar antitumor activity (67.6%
and 72% tumor growth inhibition, respectively, p > 0.05)
to the bispecific fusion protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE when
given at 0.2 mg/kg. However, when given at same dosages
(0.4 mg/kg), EGF-IGF-LDP-AE treatment resulted in the
best antitumor activity among all the groups (Figure 6A;

Figure 5: Effects of enediyne-energized fusion proteins on EGFR/IGF-1R signaling. (A) A549 cells were treated with EGF-

IGF-LDP-AE (0.1 nmol/L) for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, then the cells were stimulated with EGF or IGF-1 or IGF+IGF-1 for 30 min. And the
phosphorylation of EGFR, IGF-1R, AKT, ERK and the total EGFR, IGF-1R, AKT, ERK were detected by Western blot analysis. Actin was
used as a loading control. (B) phosphorylation and total expression levels of EGFR, IGF-1R, AKT and ERK were determined after exposure
to monospecific fusion proteins (EGF-LDP-AE or LDP-IGF-AE) for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h by Western blot analysis.

p < 0.01 compared with the EGF-LDP-AE-treated group
and LDP-IGF-AE-treated group). During the experiment,
no animal deaths were found, and Figure 6B showed that
body weight loss resulting from the lidamycin, EGF-IGFLDP-AE, EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE treatment at
the termination of the experiment did not exceed 10% of
the pretreatment weight. Thus, the animals tolerated well
to the administered dosage of fusion proteins.
To further investigate the mechanisms of antitumor
efficacy of fusion proteins in vivo, we analyzed the
phosphorylation and total expression levels of EGFR,
IGF-1R, AKT and ERK in xenograft tumor tissues by
Western blot. The results demonstrated that phosphoEGFR reduced significantly in the EGF-LDP-AE, LDPIGF-AE and EGF-IGF-LDP-AE (both 0.2 mg/kg and
0.4 mg/kg) treated tumors when compared with control
group. Activation of IGF-1R, AKT and ERK was inhibited
in lidamycin, EGF-LDP-AE, LDP-IGF-AE and EGFIGF-LDP-AE (both 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg) treatment
tumors. Besides, the total expression levels of EGFR,

IGF-1R and ERK were also influenced by the treatment of
fusion proteins. EGFR and ERK markedly reduced only in
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE (0.4 mg/kg)-treated group and IGF-1R
reduced significantly in all treated groups. But the total
AKT remained unchanged in all groups (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION
Due to the primary and acquired resistance to the
existing targeted drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, there is an urgent need
for developing new strategies against metastatic tumors.
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric fusion
proteins that combining the selectivity of targeted
treatment with the cytotoxic potency of toxins, were
highly effective in treating some of tumors. For example,
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), denileukin diftitox
(DAB389IL2, Ontak) and RFB4 (dsFv)-PE38 (BL22) all
showed improved antitumor efficacy in clinical trials

[33, 34, 36, 37]. Despite these successful examples,
immunotoxin or fusion protein has been associated with
significant toxicities to normal tissues and limited antitumor efficacy for solid tumors in many cases [38–40].
A number of studies have revealed that targeting two
tumor associated receptors would improve the selectivity
over normal tissue that expresses only one (or low levels
of both) target receptor [41–43]. The fusion protein
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE we constructed in present study, is a
bispecific molecule that targeting EGFR and IGF-1R. Both
the EGFR and IGF-1R contributed to tumor development
and progression through their effects on cell proliferation,
apoptosis and angiogenesis, and both were overexpressed
in NSCLC cells. As a result, bispecific enediyne fusion
protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE showed more potent
cytotoxicity to NSCLC cells than that of monospecific
counterparts (EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE) and naked
lidamycin in vitro. EGF-IGF-LDP-AE was also able to
more effectively inhibit the growth of A549 xenografts
in vivo. Bispecific EGF-IGF-LDP-AE at 0.2 mg/kg and
0.4 mg/kg yielded tumor growth inhibition of 69.7% and
80.5%, respectively, whereas the lidamycin-treated group
at maximum tolerated dosage (0.05 mg/kg) only showed
inhibition rate of 59.4% (p < 0.01). Furthermore, EGFIGF-LDP-AE showed more significant growth-inhibitory
effects than that of the monospecific enediyne-energized
fusion proteins EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE when
given at same dosages (0.4 mg/kg, p < 0.01).
Different from the fully antibodies or the fragments
of antibody (such as Fab, ScFv, etc) that were used as
targeting molecules, the targeting moiety of EGF-IGFLDP-AE protein is the two natural ligands: EGF and
IGF-1. Firstly, EGF and IGF-1 has high affinity to their
receptors with the Kd values of 1.77×10-7 mol/L and
4.45×10-9 mol/L, respectively [44, 45]. Secondly, the
EGF and IGF-1 are both small proteins with molecular
weights of 6.2 kDa and 7.6 kDa, respectively. And the
cytotoxic moiety lidamycin (15 kDa) was also much
smaller than the conventional toxins been used, such as
truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE40, 40 kDa), ricin A
(32 kDa), and diphtheria toxin (DT389, 43 kDa) [46–48].
The resultant EGF-IGF-LDP protein had a molecular
weight of 27.1 kDa, which would offer EGF-IGF-LDP
protein improved solid tumor penetration and decreased
immunogenicity.
Bound and internalization of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE to
NSCLC cells was the prerequisite to exert its tumor cell
killing effect. The immunofluorescence assay showed
that EGF-IGF-LDP could bind to NSCLC cells with high
affinity and then it internalize into the cells by receptormediated endocytosis. The internalization efficiency
of EGF-IGF-LDP protein was significantly higher than
that of monospecific proteins (EGF-LDP and LDP-IGF),
and this may be one of the reasons for its enhanced
cytotoxicity.

Chemotherapy drugs (such as doxorubicin and
methotrexate) have been firstly used as cytotoxic payload
to create ADCs. However, studies have shown that the
actual concentration of these drugs in tumor cells is
minimal with only 1% - 2% of the administered dose
reaching the tumor [38, 49]. As a result, it is imperative
to have a potent cytotoxic payload, being effective at
picomolar or nanomolar concentrations. Lidamycin,
used in this study as the cytotoxic moiety, was extremely
cytotoxic to multiple cancer cells with IC50 values 1000fold lower than that of mitomycin C and adriamycin
[35]. In addition to the potent cytotoxicity, another
attractive property of lidamycin being a “warhead” is
that the apoprotein (LDP) and AE can be dissociated
and reconstituted in vitro, which makes the construction
of fusion proteins very convenient. Targeting molecules
(such as ligands or scFvs) fused to the LDP firstly, then
integrating with the AE to prepare the intact fusion
proteins with high potency. Due to the above-mentioned
two advantages, lidamycin has been widely used as
an effector molecule (“warhead”) for the construction
of fusion proteins. In previous studies, five bispecific
and enediyne-energized fusion proteins with enhanced
antitumor efficacy have been prepared and evaluated by
our lab, such as EGFR/HER2-specific fusion protein EcLDP-Hr-AE, anti-gelatinases tandem scFv format dFvLDP-AE, EGFR/CD13-targeting fusion protein ER(Fv)LDP-NGR-AE, Ec-LDP-TRAIL which consisted of an
oligopeptide against EGFR and tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and the
tuftsin-based, EGFR-targeting fusion protein Ec-LDM-TF
[50–54]. These bispecific fusion proteins demonstrated
many advantages over monospecific counterparts, such as
enhanced antitumor efficacy, prolonged tumor localization
in vivo, elevated apoptosis-inducing effect and the
immunostimulating effect.
Studies have reported that lidamycin inhibits DNA
synthesis and causes cellular DNA breakage in cancer
cells [35], EGF-IGF-LDP-AE also mainly exerted its
cell-killing effect by damaging the DNA as single cell gel
electrophoresis assay showed that a significant “comet
tail” was observed after treatment with EGF-IGF-LDPAE at 0.3 pmol/L and 3 pmol/L for 48 h (Supplementary
Figure 4). Significant cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was
observed after NSCLC cells exposure to EGF-IGF-LDPAE. It also inhibited the activation of EGFR and IGF-1R,
and the two major downstream signaling pathways, Ras/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT. These mechanisms all contributed
to the antitumor activity of EGF-IGF-LDP-AE.
In summary, this study firstly showed that the
novel ligand-based EGFR/IGF-1R bispecific fusion
protein EGF-IGF-LDP-AE not only demonstrated potent
cytotoxicity to NSCLC cells in vitro, but also was highly
effective in inhibiting the growth of A549 xenografts in
vivo. The two receptor targeting property, potent antitumor
efficacy and its much smaller molecular size, suggested

and sonicated on ice using a microtip at 40% duty for 30
min. Centrifuge the entire lysate at 14,000 g for 10 min to
separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The culture
conditions that affect the expression level and solubility
of recombinant proteins, such as growth temperature, cell
density, concentration of IPTG and induction time were
optimized to improve the yield.
The fusion proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity
chromatography (HisTrap HP, GE Healthcare) according
to the manufacture’s protocol. The insoluble proteins
(EGF-LDP-IGF, EGF-IGF-LDP and LDP-IGF) were
dissolved in the binding buffer including 8 mol/L urea and
the purified denatured proteins were refolded in a way of
stepwise dialysis as reported by Tsumoto et al [55].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Animal experiment has been conducted in
accordance with the ethical standards and according to
the Declaration of Helsinki and according to national and
international guidelines and has been approved by the
Ethics Committee of Xinxiang Medical University.

Cell lines and culture
Human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549,
NCI-H460, NCI-H520 and NCI-H1299 were obtained
from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) within 6 months of experiment. All cell
lines were tested by the cell bank for viability (trypan blue
staining), mycoplasma contamination, variation (DNAFingerprinting), interspecies contamination (iso-enzyme
analysis), and endotoxin. All cells were cultured under
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C in F12K
(A549 cells) or RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.

Binding affinity and internalization assays
Immunofluorescence stain assay and flow cytometry
(FCM)-based binding assay were used to analyze
the binding of fusion proteins to NSCLC cells. For
immunofluorescence stain assay, A549 or H460 cells were
grown on coverslides and cultured at 37°C for 24 h. Then
cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, blocked with
normal goat serum, and incubated with EGF-IGF-LDP
protein (100 μg/mL) for 2 h at room temperature. After
three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with mouse
anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody (TIANGEN Biotech,
Beijing, China; diluted 1:100), followed with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Beyotime
Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China; diluted 1:50). The images
were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon
TE 2000u).
For FCM-based binding assay, all fusion proteins
were FITC labeled as reported previously [50]. Each
FITC-labeled fusion protein, EGF-LDP-IGF, EGF-IGFLDP, EGF-LDP or LDP-IGF was incubated with 105
A549, H520 or H460 cells in a 500 μL volume of PBS for
2 h at room temperature. Following three washes with 500
μL of PBS, cells were analyzed with flow cytometer (BD
Company). FCM-based internalization assays were also
done to compare the internalization efficiency of bispecific
EGF-IGF-LDP and monospecific EGF-LDP and LDP-IGF
as described by Stish et al. [56].

Construction, expression and purification of
fusion proteins
DNA sequences coding for EGF-LDP-IGF and
EGF-IGF-LDP were synthesized by Beijing Sunbiotech
Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China), and then they were digested
by NdeI/XhoI and were inserted into pET30a expression
vector to generate plasmid pET30-egf-ldp-igf and pET30egf-igf-ldp. Coding sequences for monospecific fusion
protein EGF-LDP and LDP-IGF were created by the same
way. DNA sequencing analysis (Invitrogen Corp.) was
used to verify that the gene was correct in sequence and
had been cloned in the frame.
Expression plasmids pET30-egf-ldp-igf, pET30egf-igf-ldp, pET30-egf-ldp and pET30-ldp-igf were all
transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)
competent cells. For protein solubility analysis, single
colony of pET30-egf-ldp-igf, pET30-egf-igf-ldp, pET30egf-ldp and pET30-ldp-igf were inoculated into 100 mL
LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and grown at
37 °C until the OD600 reaches 0.8. Just prior to induction,
split the 100 mL culture into 2×50 mL cultures, add
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to one of the
50 mL cultures at 1 mmol/L and use the other culture as
an uninduced control. Eight hours after induction, bacteria
were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 g.
The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL cold lysis buffer (20
mmol/L Tris-Hcl pH7.5, 0.5 mol/L NaCl, 5% glycerol)

Preparation of the enediyne-energized analogue
of fusion proteins
We have previously found that the active enediyne
chromophore (AE) of lidamycin could release from
its hydrophobic pocket of LDP in organic solvent and,
the detached LDP and AE can be reconstitute to form
intact lidamycin in PBS buffer [35]. Therefore, the AE
of lidamycin was separated by using C4 column (GE
Healthcare) with a 22% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroactic
acid mobile phase, and then the AE-containing solution
was added to EGF-LDP-IGF/PBS (10 mmol/L; pH7.4),

EGF-IGF-LDP/PBS, EGF-LDP/PBS, and LDP-IGF/PBS,
respectively, with the molecular ratio of 3:1 to prepare
their enediyne-energized analogues EGF-LDP-IGF-AE,
EGF-IGF-LDP-AE, EGF-LDP-AE and LDP-IGF-AE.
Free AE was removed by using a Sephadex G-75 column
(GE Healthcare).

LDP-AE (0.1 nmol/L) or LDP-IGF-AE (0.1 nmol/L) at
37 °C for 12 h 24 h or 48 h, followed by stimulation with
EGF (Abcam, 50 ng/mL), IGF-1 (Abcam, 50 ng/mL), or
both at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were lysed for 30 min
in lysis buffer for Western blot and immunoprecipitation
(Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) supplemented
with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).
For proteins extracted from tumor tissues, 100 mg tumor
tissues were put in 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime
Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) supplemented with 1
mmol/L PMSF, homogenized on ice, and lysed on ice for
30 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000
g for 15 min at 4 °C, and total protein was quantitated
using bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce Biochemicals). 30
μg of each total protein were applied on 10% SDS-PAGE
and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The membranes were
incubated with 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature
before incubation overnight at 4 °C with primary
antibodies (diluted 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology).
Then the membranes were incubated with secondary HRPconjugated antibodies (1:3000 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology) for 1 h after washing three times with
TBST buffer. The specific bands were visualized with the
Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate kit
(Millipore) and captured by AI600 imaging system (GE
Corp.).

Cell viability assay
MTT assay was used to measure the effects of fusion
proteins and its enediyne-energized analogues on the cell
viability as described previously [50]. Briefly, NSCLC cell
lines A549, H460, H520 and H1299 were seeded in 96well plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then different
concentrations of lidamycin or fusion proteins were added
and incubated for 48 h. MTT solution (Sigma, 5 mg/mL,
20 μL) was added to each well and incubated for another
4 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed and 150 μL
Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) were added to each well.
The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using an ELISA
reader (Thermo Fisher). Growth inhibition was calculated
as a percentage of the untreated controls.

Cell cycle distribution analysis
A549, H520 and H460 cells were treated with
0.01 nmol/L, 0.05 nmol/L, 0.1 nmol/L, 0.5 nmol/L and
1 nmol/L EGF-IGF-LDP-AE for 48 h. Then the cells
were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and
fixed with cold 70% ethanol at -20°C for 24 h. Cells was
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and the cell pellet was
washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL
PBS with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 100 μg/
mL RNase A. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, cells
were analyzed for fluorescence with a flow cytometer
(BD Company) and determined the percentage of cells in
specific cell cycle phases (G1, S, and G2/M).

In vivo efficacy experiment
Female BALB/c nude mice (18 - 22 g) were
purchased from VitalRiver Laboratory Animal Technology
Co. Ltd., and hosted under specific pathogen-free
conditions. 5×106 A549 cells suspended in 200 μL PBS
were inoculated s.c. in right armpit of nude mice. Tumorbearing mice were randomly divided into groups (n = 6)
when the tumor size was over 100 mm3, and treated with
lidamycin, EGF-IGF-LDP-AE, EGF-LDP-AE, and LDPIGF-AE, respectively, at different dosages. All fusion
proteins were injected i.v. in the tail vein and given in a
200 μL volume of PBS. One week after the first treatment,
tumor-bearing mice were injected with the fusion proteins
again at same dosages. Tumor size was measured every
3 day and tumor volume was determined by a × b2/2,
where a, and b indicated the long and the perpendicular
short diameters of the tumor, respectively. The inhibition
rates were calculated by 1 - tumor volume (treated)/tumor
volume (control) ×100%.

Cell apoptosis assay
A549, H520 and H460 cells were seeded in the
6-well plate at the density of 105 and incubated for 24 h.
After treatment with 0.1 nmol/L, 0.5 nmol/L, 1 nmol/L
and 2 nmol/L EGF-IGF-LDP-AE for 48 h, cells were
harvested (including the non-adherent cells), washed
twice with PBS, and stained with Annexin V-FITC and
PI according to the manufacture’s protocol (Beyotime
Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). The fluorescence intensity
was measured with a flow cytometer (BD Company).
