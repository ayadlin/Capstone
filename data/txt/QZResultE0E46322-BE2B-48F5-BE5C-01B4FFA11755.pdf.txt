Abstract
Repurposing "old" drugs can facilitate rapid clinical translation but necessitates novel mechanistic insight. Warfarin, a
vitamin K "antagonist" used clinically for the prevention of
thrombosis for more than 50 years, has been shown to have
anticancer effects. We hypothesized that the molecular mechanism underlying its antitumor activity is unrelated to its effect
on coagulation, but is due to inhibition of the Axl receptor
tyrosine kinase on tumor cells. Activation of Axl by its ligand
Gas6, a vitamin K-dependent protein, is inhibited at doses of
warfarin that do not affect coagulation. Here, we show that

inhibiting Gas6-dependent Axl activation with low-dose warfarin, or with other tumor-speciﬁc Axl-targeting agents, blocks
the progression and spread of pancreatic cancer. Warfarin also
inhibited Axl-dependent tumor cell migration, invasiveness,
and proliferation while increasing apoptosis and sensitivity to
chemotherapy. We conclude that Gas6-induced Axl signaling is
a critical driver of pancreatic cancer progression and its inhibition with low-dose warfarin or other Axl-targeting agents may
improve outcome in patients with Axl-expressing tumors.

Introduction

Because warfarin blocks vitamin K-dependent g-carboxylation of
glutamic acids (5) and the g-carboxyglutamic acid–rich (GLA)
domain of Gas6 is required to induce Axl tyrosine kinase activity
(6–8), we hypothesized that the antitumor activity of warfarin
could be due to inhibition of Gas6-mediated Axl activation on
tumor cells. Warfarin potently inhibits Gas6-dependent Axl activation (9) at an IC50 of 0.6 nmol/L, a concentration well below
that required to achieve anticoagulation (5, 10). Here, we exploited
this differential effect to determine whether low-dose (1.5–3.0
mmol/L) warfarin treatment impedes pancreatic cancer progression
by inhibiting Axl signaling independent of anticoagulation.

Vitamin K "antagonists" have been associated anecdotally with
antitumor and anti-metastatic effects in preclinical and clinical
studies since the 1960s (1–3). Results from dedicated clinical
studies designed to evaluate the anti-metastatic activity of warfarin
have been variable, in part due to complications associated with full
anticoagulation. The anticancer effects of warfarin are generally
attributed to thromboembolic inhibition, although the molecular
mechanism has not been elucidated. The Axl receptor tyrosine
kinase is associated with aggressive cancer and poor patient outcome in several malignancies, including pancreatic cancer (4).

Cell lines
The human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, Panc-1, Capan1, and Mia PaCa-2 were obtained from the ATCC; the murine cell
line Pan02 was obtained from the DCTD tumor repository
maintained by the NCI at Frederick. C5LM2 is a variant of Panc1
developed in our laboratory that was generated through two
passages of growth in vivo and culture of liver metastases and has
been characterized previously (11). The C5LM2, AsPC-1, Panc-1,
Pan02, and Mia PaCa-2 lines were grown in DMEM; Capan-1 was
grown in IMDM; all cell lines were grown in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere with 5% CO2, at 37C, and have been DNA ﬁngerprinted for provenance using the Power-Plex 1.2 Kit (Promega)
and conﬁrmed to be the same as the DNA ﬁngerprint library
maintained by the ATCC, and were conﬁrmed to be free of
Mycoplasma (e-Myco Kit; Boca Scientiﬁc).
Animal studies
All animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility with
24-hour access to food and water. Experiments were approved

by, and conducted in accordance with, an IACUC approved
protocol at UT Southwestern. LSL-KrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox; p48Cre
(KIC) mice were generated as previously described (12). Four- to
6-week-old female NOD/SCID and C57/Bl6 mice were obtained
from an on campus supplier. A total of 1  106 AsPc-1, Panc-1,
Mia Paca2, Capan-1, C5LM2, Mia shLuc, and Mia shAxl or 5  105
Pan02 cells were injected orthotopically as described previously
(12). Mice with established tumors, as determined by sonography
were randomized to receive normal drinking water or water
containing 1 mg/L (3.0 mmol/L) warfarin for experiments in
immunocompromised mice and 0.5 mg/L (1.5 mmol/L) in
experiments in immunocompetent animals with or without
gemcitabine 25 mg/kg twice weekly depending on experimental
design. KIC mice were treated with warfarin 4 weeks starting at 3
weeks of age. For all experiments, warfarin containing water was
replenished every 3 days. For Mia Paca2 tumor–bearing mice,
additional conditions of gemcitabine  10C9 (250 mg i.p. twice/
week) were conducted. Mice bearing Panc-1, Capan-1, C5LM2,
and Mia Paca2 tumors were sacriﬁced after 6 weeks of therapy.
AsPc-1 tumor–bearing mice received 4 weeks of therapy and
Pan02 tumor–bearing mice 3 weeks of therapy. ShRNA lines were
allowed to grow for 8 to 10 weeks. For all therapy experiments
primary tumor burden was established by weighing pancreas and
tumor en bloc. Metastatic incidence was determined by visual
inspection of the liver and abdominal cavity and conﬁrmed by
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) of liver sections. Tissues were ﬁxed
in 10% formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further
studies. C5LM2 cells were injected intrasplenically to establish
liver metastases, tumors were allowed to grow for 24 weeks and
mice were randomized to receive either normal drinking water or
warfarin (1 mg/L) starting 48 hours prior or 48 hours after tumor
cell injection. Liver tumor burden was determined by liver weight.
Histology and tissue analysis
Formalin-ﬁxed tissues were embedded in parafﬁn and cut in
6-mm sections. Sections were evaluated by H&E and immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies speciﬁc for vimentin
(Phosphosolutions), endomucin, E-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-histone H3 (Upstate), cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology). Negative controls included omission of primary antibody and immunoﬂuorescence evaluation
was conducted as described previously (12). Necrotic area was
determined by quantiﬁcation of the percentage of viable tumor
area on low magniﬁcation of tumor sections by H&E.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism
version 4.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software; www.graphpad.
com). Results are expressed as mean  SEM or SD. Data were
analyzed by the t test or ANOVA and results are considered
signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.
Additional methods are described in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Results and Discussion
We evaluated the efﬁcacy of low-dose warfarin (0.5–1 mg/L of
drinking water) as a single agent in ﬁve murine models of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA; Fig. 1A and B). Lowdose warfarin therapy was administered when animals had established intrapancreatic tumors as measured by sonography. Treat-

ment with low-dose warfarin reduced primary tumor growth in a
syngenic model (Pan02, Fig. 1A) and in a spontaneous genetic
PDA model (KIC, Fig. 1A), but had little effect on the growth of
human tumor xenografts (Panc1, AsPC1, Capan-1, Fig. 1A).
Importantly, low-dose warfarin consistently and potently inhibited metastatic burden (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1) in four
of the ﬁve PDA models. Expression analysis revealed that warfarin-sensitive tumors expressed detectable levels of Axl, whereas
the nonresponsive Capan-1 tumors did not (Fig. 1C–E). Furthermore, Gas6 was expressed at detectable levels in most PDA cell
lines (data not shown; ref. 4), indicative of autocrine Axl activation. To evaluate the effects of selective Axl inhibition on PDA, we
used a stable retroviral shRNA approach. Axl knockdown
completely suppressed the growth of orthotopic Mia PaCa-2
tumors (Fig. 1F). Extended in vivo growth of shAxl Mia Paca-2
cells in an independent experiment resulted in 4 of 7 mice
developing tumors. These tumors were subsequently found to
express Axl (Supplementary Fig. S1). To validate tumor-selective
inhibition of Axl activity in the treatment setting, we developed a
function-blocking human-speciﬁc anti-Axl monoclonal antibody, 10C9 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Treatment of established
orthotopic Mia PaCa-2 tumors with 10C9 blunted primary tumor
growth and potently suppressed metastases (Fig. 1G). These
results support the notion that low-dose warfarin inhibits pancreatic tumor progression in a manner dependent on tumor cell
Axl expression.
To determine the effect of warfarin on Gas6-induced Axl
signaling in PDA, we evaluated phosphorylated Axl (pAxl) and
downstream signaling via the PI3K–Akt signaling pathway (13).
Warfarin-prevented g-carboxylation of Gas6 in vitro (Fig. 2A) and
inhibited basal pAxl levels in Panc-1 cells, an effect that was
rescued by addition of exogenous vitamin K (Fig. 2B). The effect
of warfarin on pAxl was validated in Mia PaCa-2 and Panc-1 by
immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S3). Further warfarin
or BGB324, a speciﬁc inhibitor of Axl tyrosine kinase activity (14)
inhibited phosphorylation of Axl in Panc-1 cells (Fig. 2C). Consistent with these results, treatment of Panc-1 cells in vitro with
10C9 resulted in decreased Axl and p-Axl levels (Supplementary
Fig. S2C and S2D). Furthermore, warfarin inhibited Gas6-induced
activation of AKT in Panc1 cells in vitro (Fig. 2D). In addition, the
effect of low-dose warfarin treatment on Panc-1 xenografts was
consistent with the effects on Axl signaling in vitro. Warfarin
treatment substantially suppressed the level of pAxl and pAkt
in Panc-1 tumors (Fig. 2E), decreased expression of phosphorylated histone H3, a marker of proliferation, and elevated cleaved
caspase-3, and tumor necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S4), and
increased the level of cleaved Parp (Fig. 2E). Low-dose warfarin
also reduced intratumoral microvessel density (Supplementary
Fig. S4D) consistent with the reported proangiogenic activity of
Axl (15).
Axl has been associated with enhanced tumor cell migration
and metastatic invasiveness (16). Warfarin reduced basal and
Gas6-induced cell migration (scratch assay) in an Axl-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, tumor cell sphere formation and invasiveness in 3D culture was inhibited by warfarin
and shRNA knockdown of Axl in Mia PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 3A–C).
Warfarin also inhibited anchorage-independent growth of Axlexpressing cells (Fig. 3D) and inhibited liver colonization of
Panc-1 cells after intrasplenic injection regardless of whether
warfarin was administered pre- or post (48 hours)-tumor cell
injection (Fig. 3E).

Warfarin Inhibits Axl-Mediated Tumor Progression

Figure 1.
Warfarin inhibits tumor progression in Axl-expressing cell lines. A, primary tumor burden after therapy with warfarin. Therapy was initiated when implanted tumors
3
were visible by ultrasound (10 mm ) and consisted of control (normal drinking water) or warfarin, administered in the drinking water at 0.5 mg/L
[immunocompetent mice: Pan02 (n ¼ 4, control; 3, warfarin); KIC (n ¼ 10, control; 8, warfarin)] or 1 mg/L [Panc-1 (n ¼ 10, control; 8, warfarin); AsPC-1 (n ¼ 8,
control; 6, warfarin); Capan-1 (n ¼ 10, control; 7, warfarin)] and continued for 2 to 4 weeks until control mice were moribund. Therapy in KIC mice was
initiated at 3 weeks of age and continued for 4 weeks. B, metastases were determined grossly upon sacriﬁce and conﬁrmed by histologic evaluation of
the liver. Metastatic burden was normalized to mean number of metastases in control-treated animals and is displayed as a fold change. Incidence of metastasis
is also indicated. C, murine pancreatic cancer cells express Axl by ﬂow cytometry. D and E, expression of Axl message and protein by human pancreatic
cancer cell lines. F, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Axl suppresses growth of orthotopic Mia PaCa-2 tumors (n ¼ 8, shLuc; 7, shAxl). Tumor volume determined by
serial ultrasound. G, inhibition of Axl with mAb 10C9 reduces tumor growth and suppresses metastasis of MiaPaCa-2 tumors (n ¼ 7, control; 8, 10C9).
Therapy with mAb 10C9 (250 mg twice/week) was initiated when tumors were established as above and persisted for 4 weeks. All results were compared
by the unpaired two-tailed t test with Welch's correction; actual P values are shown; error bars, SEM.

We also evaluated whether Axl inhibition with warfarin or
10C9 augmented the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine, the frontline therapy
for pancreatic cancer. Warfarin treatment had no effect on the IC50
value of gemcitabine on Axl-negative cells lines (Capan-1 and Mia
PaCa-2 shAxl) in vitro. However, low-dose warfarin potentiated
the antiproliferative effect of gemcitabine, reducing the IC50 value
8.4- and 211-fold in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells, respectively. Warfarin also lowered the gemcitabine IC50 value in Mia PaCa-2 and
Pan02 cells (Supplementary Table S2). In vivo blockade of Axl
activation with low-dose warfarin or 10C9-augmented gemcitabine reduction of primary tumor growth and dramatically
improved metastatic control (Fig. 3F and G).
Metastasis and drug resistance are linked to induction of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene programs in
pancreatic cancer (17). Axl expression is elevated in tumor cells by
EMT and correlated with mesenchymal marker proteins such as
vimentin (16). Mia PaCa-2 cells display an EMT-like phenotype
under basal conditions (18). We found that treatment of Mia
PaCa-2 cells with warfarin for 48 hours in vitro reduced pAxl levels,

surface Axl expression, and the mesenchymal markers Zeb1 and
vimentin, while elevating the expression of the epithelial marker
E-cadherin (Supplementary Fig. S5). Treatment of Panc-1 cells in
vitro with TGFb and collagen I, conditions that induce EMT,
enhanced Axl expression and activation, an effect that was blocked
by addition of warfarin (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these results,
Zeb1 and nuclear b-catenin levels, another mesenchymal marker,
were signiﬁcantly reduced by warfarin indicative of phenotypic
reversal (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Gas6 addition to Panc1 cells in
culture increased the expression of vimentin and Zeb1, an effect
that was blocked by 10C9 (Fig. 4B). In addition, we identiﬁed that
exposure to TGFb and collagen induced Axl expression in Capan-1
cells (Capan-EMT), which correlated with increased expression of
transcription factors (Zeb1, Snail, and Twist) that drive EMT. The
EMT-dependent induction of Axl in Capan-1 established autocrine activation via endogenous Gas6. Correspondingly, the
Capan-EMT cells were sensitive to treatment with warfarin, leading to decreased Axl expression, upregulated E-cadherin, and
increased cleaved caspase-3 levels (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Finally, we found that low-dose warfarin treatment of PDA Panc1
xenografts reduced expression of vimentin and elevated the
expression of E-cadherin, results consistent with the observed
EMT reversal in vitro (Fig. 4C).
Our data show that warfarin exerts its anticancer effects by
inhibiting Gas6-mediated Axl activation on tumor cells. We found
that Gas6-Axl signal transduction is required to maintain epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity traits of aggressive pancreatic tumors
comprising tumorigenicity, invasiveness, survival, drug sensitivity, and metastasis. EMT gene-expression patterns are apparent
early in pancreatic cancer development, associated with inﬂammatory premalignant lesions, and drive early metastatic spread.
Inﬂammatory mediators such as TGFb that induce EMT transcription factor–mediated gene reprogramming are prominent in
malignant pancreatic cancer. Consistent with this, Axl expression
is elevated by EMT transcription factors in breast and lung
epithelial cells (16, 19, 20). Furthermore, Axl expression is associated with EMT gene signatures in drug-resistant non–small cell

3702 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

lung cancer and a requisite effector of EMT-related acquired
resistance to various therapeutics (19). The wide spread expression of Axl in advanced cancer from diverse cellular origins
suggests that tumor cell–associated Axl is a fundamental contributor to malignant progression. Inhibition of Axl signaling is
associated with loss of malignant traits, including cell migration
and metastasis (16). Congruently, we show that low-dose
warfarin treatment and tumor-speciﬁc Axl–selective targeting
potently block metastasis in several models of PDA. This is
associated with a loss of mesenchymal protein expression and
EMT transcription factor expression that result in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.
Our results demonstrate that low-dose warfarin-mediated Axl
inhibition is effective as an anticancer agent without associated
complications from anticoagulation. These results strongly suggest that the anecdotal antitumor effects observed clinically with
coumarin-based anticoagulants are due in part to speciﬁc inhibition of Gas6-mediated Axl activation on tumor cells. These

results are consistent with recent studies that show g-carboxylation of Gas6 is required for Gas6-mediated Axl activation (21).
Furthermore, Paolino and colleagues (10) demonstrated that
low-dose warfarin treatment (0.5 mg/L in drinking water) inhibits
Gas6-mediated activation of TAM receptors, Tyro3, Axl, and Mer
(aka Mertk) on natural killer (NK) cells, leading to enhanced NK
cell antitumor activity in a murine mammary adenocarcinoma
(4T1) model system. We have previously shown that tumorselective Axl inhibition is sufﬁcient to block metastasis in the
4T1 model (20). Hence, the effects of systemic Axl inhibition may
exert antitumor effects through tumor and host–response-dependent mechanisms. On the other hand, although each of the
animal models we used has an intact NK compartment, we did
not observe any antitumor activity in Axl-negative Capan-1 cells,
suggesting minimal NK cell antitumor activity in these models.
Taken together, our results of tumor-selective Axl inhibition in
multiple settings suggest that inhibition of tumor cell Axl tyrosine
kinase activity is a critical determinant for the observed efﬁcacy of
warfarin in cancer patients.
