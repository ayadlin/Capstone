BACKGROUND: The authors present the long-term follow-up (>25 years) data from 1 of the original prospective, randomized trials
that compared adjuvant chemotherapy with expectant management in patients with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma. In addition,
the value of pathologic necrosis induced by a single cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was analyzed as a predictive marker of disease-free and overall survival. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma were enrolled in a prospective
trial that was performed between 1981 and 1984 at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA). Patients were randomized to
receive either adjuvant chemotherapy or observation after surgical resection. Long-term outcomes, follow-up, and pathologic review
of all available histologic sections were performed. RESULTS: The 25-year disease-free survival rate was 28% for patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 15% for the untreated patients (P ¼ .02). The overall survival rate at 25 years was
also significantly higher for treated patients versus untreated patients (38% vs 15%; P ¼ .02). Tumor necrosis >90% after a single
round of chemotherapy was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival and disease-free survival for patients who received
adjuvant therapy (164 months vs 65 months [P ¼ .04] and 141 months vs 14 months [P < .01], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma who received adjuvant chemotherapy after undergoing definitive surgical resection had a
statistically significant benefit in disease-free and overall survival that was maintained through 25 years. Tumor necrosis after just 1
cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation was predictive of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients who received

INTRODUCTION
Several landmark studies during the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving
the survival of patients with osteosarcoma. Before that, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with localized, highgrade osteosarcoma was <20%.1 Today, with modern multimodality therapy combining systemic chemotherapy and
advanced surgical resection, the cure rate for this patient population exceeds 70%.2
One of these landmark studies was the prospective, randomized trial performed by Eilber et al from 1981 to 1984
that compared adjuvant chemotherapy with no treatment after resection in patients with high-grade, operable osteosarcoma.3 That study was discontinued after 2 years, because those receiving immediate adjuvant chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in disease free-survival (DFS) (55% vs 20%; P < .01). In addition, the study also provided
evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy improves patient survival (overall survival (OS) (80% vs 40%; P<.01). Although
short-term DFS improvement with adjuvant chemotherapy was demonstrated in the original study, maintenance of the
survival benefit has not been reported. In the current study, we provide the 25 year follow-up on the original randomized
cohort from the study by Eilber et al in order to better delineate the incidence, natural history, and risk factors predictive
of relapse and death in these patients with osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

One hundred twelve patients with primary bone tumors
were evaluated between 1981 and 1984, and 78 were
determined to have disease pathologically consistent with
osteosarcoma. Nineteen were excluded because they had
radiographic evidence of metastatic disease on presentation, low-grade osteosarcoma, or osteosarcoma associated
with Paget disease. After informed consent was obtained,
the 59 patients with stage IIA/IIB, intramedullary, highgrade osteosarcoma were enrolled onto the trial. Thirtytwo patients were randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, and 27 were randomized to no adjuvant therapy
(Fig. 1). Age, sex, primary tumor site, and mean followup for each group are listed (Table 1).
Initial treatment for all patients included a single
round of chemotherapy and radiation, as described in the
original article.3 Four weeks after the completion of radiation, the patients underwent surgical excision of the tumor. The decision to proceed with limb salvage versus
amputation was based on the surgical oncologic principles
of the time: tumors of the tibia, large size, or in patients
aged <10 years were considered indications for amputation. Forty-four patients underwent limb salvage, and 15
patients underwent amputation.
Patients who were randomized to receive adjuvant
chemotherapy were treated on the T-10B protocol
(high-dose methotrexate and doxorubicin plus combined
bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin-D),4 as

described in the original report.3 Patients in the treatment
group who developed a recurrence received salvage chemotherapy with doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cisplatin 120
mg/m2 every 28 days for 5 months. Surgical resection of
tumor recurrence and/or pulmonary metastases were performed after the last course of chemotherapy.
Patients who developed recurrent osteosarcoma in
the control arm (no adjuvant chemotherapy) received the
T-10B protocol. Patients who had resectable tumors after
chemotherapy underwent surgical resection of the metastases, and those who had unresectable disease had their
chemotherapy changed to the doxorubicin and cisplatin
salvage protocol outlined above.
Twenty-four of 27 patients who were randomized to
the control arm did not receive postoperative chemotherapy; whereas 3 patients crossed over and received some
postoperative chemotherapy, but none received the T10B protocol. Twenty-eight of the 32 patients who were
randomized to receive the T-10 protocol received the
entire course. The 4 remaining patients who did not
receive the entire course refused chemotherapy at some
stage during the study.
Statistical analysis was performed using standard
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in an intent-to-treat format. An as-treated analysis was not performed. Univariate
Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the
effect of chemotherapy, age, sex, surgical procedure

Original Results

With a mean follow-up of 2 years, the patients who
received immediate adjuvant chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in DFS compared with
those who did not receive chemotherapy (55% vs 20%; P
< .01). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy also
had a statistically significant improvement in OS (80% vs
48%; P < .01).

was longer in the group that received adjuvant therapy compared with the no adjuvant therapy group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (11 months vs 7
months; P ¼ .13). For all patients who died of disease, the
mean time to death was similar in both groups: 32 months
in the T-10B group (median, 23 months; range, 13-102
months) and 33 months in the no adjuvant therapy group
(median, 18 months; range, 4-149 months) (Table 2).
Univariate analysis revealed that at the 5-year, 10year, and 15-year time points; age; sex; and the procedure
performed were not significant predictors of disease-specific survival. The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy,
however, did lead to a significant improvement in diseasespecific survival at all time points (Table 3). Disease-free
survival curves for both groups up to 25 years are provided
in Figure 2. It is noteworthy that no patients in either group
had a recurrence at >5 years after his or her index surgery.

Long-Term Results

Tumor Necrosis

The median follow-up for surviving patients was 303
months (range, 206-325 months). The DFS rate for the
T-10B adjuvant treatment group was 28% compared
with 15% for the patients who did not receive adjuvant
therapy (P ¼ .018; log-rank test) (Fig. 2). The 25-year OS
rate for patients in the T-10B arm was 38% compared
with 15% for those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (P ¼ .023; log-rank test) (Fig. 3).
Two of 20 patients (10%) who developed metastatic
disease or a recurrence in the T-10B group and 1 of 24
patients (4%) with metastatic disease or recurrence in the no
adjuvant therapy arm were cured. The mean time to relapse

Histologic analysis of tumor necrosis was performed on
specimens from 46 of the 59 patients (78%). The slides
from 13 patients were not available for review, because
they either were returned to the patient’s home medical
institution or were damaged in the Northridge earthquake
of 1994. All histologic specimens were from the original
resection, which was performed after a single round of
chemotherapy.
For all 46 patients, tumor necrosis was not significantly predictive of survival. Patients who had tumor necrosis <90% survived for a mean of 97 months (range, 4304 months), whereas patients who had tumor necrosis

DISCUSSION
Although adjuvant chemotherapy currently is a mainstay
of our armamentarium to combat osteosarcoma, it was
Cancer

not always so. Several landmark studies, including that by
Eilber et al and the Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma
Study (MIOS),7 indelibly changed treatment for osteosarcoma, because those investigators prospectively evaluated
adjuvant chemotherapy in a randomized fashion among
patients with localized, high-grade disease. However,
many of those studies, including the studies noted above,
were discontinued at relatively short follow-up, because
statistically significant treatment benefits of chemotherapy were noted during predesigned, early data analyses.
The survival benefit over a long period (ie, decades) was
assumed from these studies, but never demonstrated.
Moreover, a recent study by Berend et al suggests that the
conclusions drawn from the Eilber et al and MIOS studies
may be outdated, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy may have no survival benefit after neoadjuvant therapy and resection.8 It is in this context that analyzing the
25-year follow-up from the original cohort was performed
to answer the question of whether survival benefits of
adjuvant chemotherapy are maintained over time.
At a median follow-up of >25 years, the current
study indicates that improvements in DFS and OS in
patients with osteosarcoma who receive adjuvant chemotherapy are maintained with statistical significance.
Although the original study was hindered by short followup, this study confirms that the survival benefit in this
cohort is maintained over 25 years. Although the intellectual concept from the Berend et al study is compelling—
aggressive preoperative chemotherapy should eradicate
sensitive micrometastases and wide margins should clear
the local tumor burden—our investigation suggests that
adjuvant chemotherapy provided a sustained, statistically
significant survival benefit despite preoperative chemotherapy and radiation.

Original Article

An additional piece of information gleaned from
this cohort is that no patients developed a tumor recurrence 5 years after initial resection. Although other studies
have reported local recurrences up to 17 years after resection,9 our data suggest that local recurrence is at least a
rare event after 5 years. However, this does not obviate the
need for continued regular follow-up and surveillance after 5 years. Previous reports have indicated that 5% to
10% of patients with osteosarcoma who have survived at 5
years will experience a recurrence or a second malignant
neoplasm after 5 years of follow-up.10,11 Therefore, it is
our institutional practice to follow these patients annually
in perpetuity.
Although we conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy
had a sustained survival benefit in this cohort, the cohort
does not help address the issue regarding whether neoadjuvant therapy added to adjuvant therapy has a survival
benefit over adjuvant therapy alone. Recent literature has
suggested that, in patients who underwent surgical resection and received adjuvant chemotherapy, there was no
difference in event-free survival among patients who
received neoadjuvant therapy before resection.12 Because
all of the patients in this cohort received neoadjuvant therapy, the study population is not suited to provide any
insights into this important finding, and we will rely on
future studies to address this question.
The current study confirms the well known correlation between survival expectancy and tumor pathologic necrosis. In this trial, pathologic necrosis was
assessed after a single cycle of chemotherapy and preoperative radiotherapy, in contrast to current practice, in
which neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered for
12 weeks before patients undergo surgery with the
objective of local control. This suggests that response
assessment could be made earlier, perhaps stratifying
patients into good or poor responder categories much
earlier. Although our group’s more recent work has used
combined positron emission tomography/comupted tomography (PET/CT) imaging to noninvasively assess
early response,13 this study was structured so that histologic data would be available after a single dose of chemotherapy and radiation. The confirmation that early
good responders (tumor necrosis >90%) have improved
survival if chemotherapy is continued corroborates
other clinical trials and our data with combined PET/
CT scanning suggest that good responders will continue
to do well with adjuvant chemotherapy. The finding
that tumor necrosis was not predictive of survival if
chemotherapy was discontinued confirms the belief that
early response may be of value to tailor on-going treat5892

ment, and not to dictate the length of treatment. Identifying responders to treatment and continuing therapy
based on this response remains a fundamental tenet of
our treatment protocol for adult soft tissue sarcomas.
Whether this is applicable to children, adolescents, and
adults with osteosarcoma remains to be determined.
Assessing how to manage nonresponders with alterations in treatment protocol is an area that continues to
challenge us and requires further investigation. However, this study of early pathologic response to therapy
contributes to the increasing body of evidence that
responses to therapy can be evaluated much earlier in
the treatment course. Future research hopefully will
identify molecular markers in tumors that will distinguish responders from nonresponders before the initiation of treatment.
This study has several weaknesses that must be
addressed. First, we acknowledge that the neoadjuvant
chemotherapy used today has changed substantially
from the regimen used in the study cohort, which may
temper the applicability of conclusions drawn from these
data. In fact, literature from the European Osteosarcoma
Intergroup has suggests that a short, intensive course of
doxorubicin and cisplatin may be as effective as the polydrug T10 regimen.14 Because the neoadjuvant regimen
used in this study may not be as effective as current regimens, the adjuvant therapy in this cohort may demonstrate a distortedly large survival benefit. The current
standard of care for osteosarcoma includes high-dose
methotrexate (12 g/m2), rather than the low-dose that
the patients in this study received, as well as the abandoning of bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, actinomycinD, and vincristine because of unproven efficacy. This
may explain the overall inferior survival in this cohort
compared with the approximately 70% expected longterm survival for patients with localized osteosarcoma
who received treatment today.
The current study has another weakness, in that 17
of 23 patients in the control group ended up receiving
chemotherapy for their recurrence. This may have affected
our ability to interpret the long-term results of the study
as a demonstration of the efficacy of chemotherapy, and it
offers an alternative conclusion suggesting the efficacy of
early chemotherapy versus late chemotherapy (after recurrence). Interpretation of the results in that manner would
serve as a validation of the work by Link,15 who demonstrated an OS overall survival benefit from chemotherapy
at initial presentation as opposed to delaying chemotherapy until recurrence. Thus, the current study indicates
that the survival benefit from the initiation of
Cancer

December 1, 2012

Long-Term Osteosarcoma Trial Follow-Up/Bernthal et al

chemotherapy at first presentation of osteosarcoma is
maintained at 25 years.
In addition, in this study, we did not evaluate tumor
necrosis at the time of surgery. Although tumor necrosis
has been well established as a prognostic marker,16 a survival benefit from intensifying or changing therapy based
on tumor necrosis has not yet been proven. It is our hope
that randomized, international, multicenter, collaborative
trials, such as the European and American Osteosarcoma
Study Group (EURAMOS) EURAMOS1 trial, which
randomizes patients with osteosarcoma who have poor tumor necrosis to receive the addition of intensified therapy
with ifosfamide and etoposide to the standard backbone
arm of high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin, will answer this question.
In conclusion, the current results suggest that, in
patients with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma who
receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergo surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy carries a statistically significant OS and DFS benefit out to 25 years.
Tumor necrosis after just 1 round of chemotherapy
and preoperative radiation was predictive of OS and
DFS in patients who went on to continue receiving
chemotherapy. Although prospective, randomized trials
undoubtedly should form the backbone of our scientific understanding of the role of chemotherapy in osteosarcoma, a long-term, retrospective analysis like this
provides key insight into the durability of survival
benefits over time. A sustained survival benefit over
25 years provides strong evidence for the importance
of adjuvant chemotherapy in our treatment of
osteosarcoma.
