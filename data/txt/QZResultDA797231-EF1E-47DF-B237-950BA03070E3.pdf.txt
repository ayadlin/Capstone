ABSTRACT
An understanding of tissue data variability in relation to processing techniques
during and postsurgery would be desirable when testing surgical specimens for
clinical diagnostics, drug development, or identification of predictive biomarkers.
Specimens of normal and colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues removed during
colon and liver resection surgery were obtained at the beginning of surgery and
postsurgically, tissue was fixed at 10, 20, and 45 minutes. Specimens were analyzed
from 50 patients with primary CRC and 43 with intrahepatic metastasis of CRC using
a whole genome gene expression array. Additionally, we focused on the epidermal
growth factor receptor pathway and quantified proteins and their phosphorylation
status in relation to tissue processing timepoints.
Gene and protein expression data obtained from colorectal and liver specimens
were influenced by tissue handling during surgery and by postsurgical processing
time. To obtain reliable expression data, tissue processing for research and diagnostic
purposes needs to be highly standardized.

INTRODUCTION

the tissue and preserving its molecular composition (cold
ischemia time) [4-8]. In addition, patients (cells) are
exposed to drugs and/or are manipulated in ways that
may influence expression profiles and pathway activity,
resulting in inaccurate analytical data. However, there
are no systematic studies analyzing the impact of preanalytical factors.
The present study was conducted to gain a better
understanding of the effects that warm and cold ischemia
have on the molecular composition of a tissue specimen.
Specimens from normal and colorectal cancer
(CRC) tissue, normal liver and intrahepatic metastases
of CRC were collected in a highly standardized manner

The development of personalized medicine in
oncology (determining an individual’s disease risk,
prognosis, and therapeutic options) is fostered by
high-throughput analysis of molecular biomarkers in
human cancer biospecimens [1]. Insufficient quality of
such specimens may lead to spurious results and data
misinterpretation [2]. Biospecimen quality depends on
the pre-analytical conditions in which it was acquired
[3]. Of critical importance is the time interval between
reducing blood supply and removing the tissue (warm
ischemia time), and the time interval between removing

by specially trained staff present during entire surgery,
both before surgery (presurgery), after hepatic pedicle
clamping (post-clamping), and at 10, 20, and 45 minutes
after resection of the tumor (10’, 20’, and 45’ postsurgery,
respectively). The molecular composition was investigated
on the RNA, protein, and protein phosphorylation levels
comparing normal tissue (with a rather homogeneous cell
composition) with cancer tissue (representing a highly
heterogeneous tissue with different ratios of malignant and
[varying subtypes] of non-malignant cells).
The ultimate goals of this study were to:
i) Use whole genome gene expression analysis to
provide a list of genes whose expression was unstable
under warm and cold ischemic conditions and would need
to be analyzed with caution in research and development
programs.
ii) Determine variability of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway proteins and their
phosphorylation status with respect to tissue processing as
examples of critical clinical biomarkers whose expression
and activity level inform targeted therapy evaluation in
cancer.
iii) Identify genes and proteins whose expression
significantly changes during and after surgery, and
therefore may serve as biomarkers of tissue quality.

and postsurgical processing time was significantly higher
in cancer tissue. Within 10’ and 45’ postsurgery, up to
3,087 (mean 830) genes in metastatic liver CRC tumors
showed ≥2-fold and significant difference in expression.
In primary CRC tissue, comparison between presurgery
and 10’ postsurgery biopsies identified up to 3,792 (mean
1,234) genes and 45’ postsurgery biopsies identified up
to 4,116 (mean 1,553) genes. Supplementary Tables 1–4
summarize all genes that showed a significant and ≥2fold change in expression during surgery and postsurgical
processing.

Identification of potential RNA-based tissue
quality biomarkers
Hierarchical clustering was used to further evaluate
gene expression data and to categorize different patient
groups. Clustering of data from patients who had colon
surgery (normal and tumor tissue clustering separately)
resulted in seven different partitions. Most patients (89%
with normal tissue) fell into the partition (presurgery/10’,
20’, 45’ postsurgery) meaning that the presurgery
timepoint separated from the 10’, 20’, and 45’ postsurgery
timepoints.
Excluding five patients who were regarded
as outliers, only patients following the partition
presurgery/10’ 20’ 45’ postsurgery in normal tissue were
used to compare gene expression intensity levels with
multiple t-tests between the presurgery and 10’ postsurgery
timepoints, and presurgery and 45’ postsurgery timepoints.
In normal colon tissue, 70 probes showed a differential
expression in both comparisons. Of these, seven probes
(encoding for five different genes) had a log-fold change
of ≥2 in both comparisons (Table 2). Expression of another
five genes showed ≥2 log-fold change in the comparison
presurgery versus 45’ postsurgery only, while the log-fold
change was slightly lower in the presurgery versus 10’
postsurgery comparison. Genes that were significantly upregulated upon resection of normal colon tissue comprised
transcription factors (EGR1, FOS), signaling molecules
(CYR61, RGS1, SGK1) of the extracellular matrix, and
dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1, a protein that
dephosphorylates MAPK1). Gene expression for mucosal
proteins such as dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2, a protein that
plays a role in antimicrobial defense), solute carrier family
6 (SLC6A14, a protein mediating amino acid transport),
and vanin 1 (VNN1, a protein involved in vitamin B5
recycling), was down-regulated. In colon tumor tissue,
similar gene expression changes were found for CYR61,
RGS1, DUSP1, DUOX2, and SLC6A14, although the
log-fold change was generally lower compared to normal
tissue (Table 2).
The same approach was not applicable to normal
liver tissue because of the low number of affected genes
and a more diverse change of expression (data not shown).

RESULTS
Patient recruitment
Fifty patients with primary CRC and 43 with
intrahepatic metastasis of CRC were enrolled in the study.
From the 50 patients with a primary tumor, 370 formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 780 frozen in liquid
nitrogen (FF) tissue samples were collected, and from
the 43 patients with metastasized cancer, 592 FFPE and
642 FF tissue samples were collected. All samples were
subjected to morphological quality control (Supplementary
Figure 1).

Surgery and postsurgical tissue processing
significantly affects gene expression in normal
colon, normal liver, and CRC tissue
Ten-minute clamping time of the hepatic artery
significantly changed the expression of up to 690 (mean
118) genes in normal liver. The number of affected
genes increased with surgery time (Figure 1). While
some genes normalized (vs first biopsy), other genes had
significant changes in expression level with prolonged
surgery and postsurgical tissue processing time. The
number of affected genes in normal liver and normal
colon was similar (Table 1). In contrast to normal tissue,

Identification of housekeeping genes not affected
by surgery and tissue processing

tissue EGFR expression changed ≥2-fold in 10% of
patients, while expression of the downstream protein
p70-S6K changed >2-fold in 35% of patients between
presurgery and 45’ postsurgery. In CRC tissue, expression
changes in EGFR-related proteins were striking. Between
presurgery and 10’ postsurgery, EGFR total protein
expression changed by >2-fold in 20% of all patients
and in 30% of all patients within a further 35 minutes
(presurgery/45’ postsurgery). Subsequently, expression of
downstream proteins, such as p70-S6K, changed >2-fold
from presurgery to 45’ postsurgery in more than 60% of
patients.
While the change in total protein level became
statistically significant for AKT, MTOR, ERK1/2,
GSK3B, p70-S6K (Figure 2), and HIF1A (data not
shown), other proteins (Figure 2) such as EGFR showed
up- and down-regulation in individual patients and, while
still showing unstable expression in some patients, it was
not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure 3).

Gene expression data were sorted according to the
coefficients of variance (CV). The 10 probe sets with the
lowest CV across all four timepoints in normal tissue
are listed in Table 3. While some probe sets encoded
for insufficiently explored proteins, among those very
constitutively-expressed genes was eukaryotic translation
elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1), a widely expressed
gene with high copy numbers that is known as a potential
housekeeping gene for gene expression analysis [9].
Further well-known housekeeping genes with low CV
were ribosomal proteins L13 and S18, beta-glucuronidase,
and beta-actin, while other frequently used housekeeping
genes, such as beta-2-microglobulin and beta2B-tubulin,
were not constitutively expressed.
The same exercise was conducted for gene
expression in CRC tissue (data not shown). Again,
EEF1A1 expression showed a very low CV, suggesting
it may function as a reference gene in both normal and
neoplastic colorectal tissue.

Surgery and postsurgical processing strongly
affects phosphorylation of key signaling molecules
within the AKT and MAPK pathway

Up to 60% of patients showed changes of EGFRpathway protein expression

The phosphorylation status of key signaling proteins
was significantly affected in most patients and to a larger
extent in tumor tissue compared with normal tissue.
We found a chain of phosphorylation events indicating
activation in some and inactivation in other parts of the
phosphorylation cascade (data not shown). While these
changes remain to be evaluated by a more detailed analysis
of clinical variables, we found statistically significant
changes in most key regulatory proteins between
presurgery and 10’ postsurgery samples and additional
changes for some proteins during the postsurgical cold
ischemia time. This included AKT, MTOR, ERK1/2, and
MEK (Figure 2).
In normal colon and liver tissue, total levels of most
proteins did not differ significantly between timepoints.

EGFR and its downstream key signaling proteins
of the AKT and MAPK pathway were investigated in
relation to total protein concentration and phosphorylation
status. Using expression levels of presurgery biopsies as
a reference, changes (up or down) in protein expression
of ≥2-fold were documented. In normal liver tissue the
preclamping tissue biopsy was used as reference.
Overall, changes in the expression of EGFRpathway proteins were lowest in normal liver, higher in
normal colon, and highest in cancer tissue (Supplementary
Figure 2). In liver tissue, a change in total protein
expression was not observed, while in normal colon

However, there was a statistically significant increase
at 10’ postsurgery for AKT and MTOR in CRC tissue.
Protein phosphorylation decreased significantly with
warm and cold ischemia in normal colon and CRC tumor
tissue (Figure 2). It is important to note that protein
phosphorylation showed similar trends for changes in
selected proteins in both tissue types (normal tissue and
highly heterogeneous tumor tissue). This implies that these
regulations occur irrespective of the cell type and, thus,
could serve as tissue quality marker independent of the
kind of tissue (normal and tumor).
The above mentioned decline in protein
phosphorylation was mostly associated with decreased
stain intensity upon immunohistochemistry, which was
statistically significant for phosphorylated EGFR, AKT,
and ERK1/2. Example images of immunohistochemistry
for the detection of p-AKT in a patient with colon cancer
in relation to ischemia time are shown in Figure 3.

levels were similar across all groups, the percentage
of phosphorylated versus total HSP27 increased over
time in an almost linear fashion from presurgery to 45’
postsurgery in most patients, demonstrating a statistically
significant difference between presurgery/preclamping
samples versus those taken after prolonged cold ischemia
(Supplementary Figure 4). After 45’ postsurgery of cold
ischemia, the proportion of HSP27 phosphorylation had
increased 8-fold compared to presurgery levels. In normal
liver tissue it had increased 2-fold.

DISCUSSION
Pharmaceutical companies put significant efforts
into the development of specific pathway inhibitors, and
new drugs can emerge in high numbers from preclinical
development programs. Identification of drug targets
as stratification and predictive biomarkers in patient
populations has become an important field in drug
development; indeed, such biomarkers are thought to
be essential for current and future patient care and an
important strategy in controlling reimbursement costs in
cancer care.
While DNA aberrations such as activating mutations
in specific genes allow the identification to some extent of

drug targets under various circumstances, this approach is
of limited predictive value. Utilization of protein targets
and cancer pathway activity as determined by quantifying
phosphorylation of regulatory proteins can provide a
much deeper insight into a patient’s individual tumor
biology. However, a major challenge for the discovery
and development of predictive drug targets is the need for
tissue samples that truly represent the reality of a patient’s
tumor biology. As most tissues are surgical specimens, a
major concern is the risk of modified expression levels
because of tissue manipulation during and after surgery.
Understanding the effects of surgical manipulation
on cancer biomarkers will be an important part of the
knowledge base upon which such biomarkers can be fully
utilized to benefit patients.
Stemming the blood supply rapidly induces hypoxia
and cellular stress and is thought to affect the molecular
composition of cells and thus, the analytical data derived
from these tissues. In addition, during surgery, patients
(and, naturally, their cells) are exposed to various kinds of
drugs given by the anesthetist.
In this study we demonstrate that human tissue
is highly susceptible to surgical factors and prolonged
postsurgical ischemia, and standardized handling of
tissue is an important factor for subsequent analysis.
Analyzing known stress and ischemia markers such as
HSP27 [12] and HIF1A [13-14], we found that in normal
liver tissue, HSP27 phosphorylation was significantly
increased at 10 minutes after hepatic pedicle clamping
and further increased throughout post-resection
ischemia in a time-dependent manner. In normal colon
tissue, HSP27 phosphorylation increased in an almost
linear time-dependent manner between 10’ and 45’
postsurgery. Hence, HSP27 phosphorylation appears to
be an interesting marker for pre- and post-resection tissue
quality. We also found a significant increase in HIF1A
protein levels 10’ postsurgery of colorectal tumors which,
however, declined again at later timepoints. Interestingly,
influence of ischemia on protein phosphorylation has been
detected independent from tissue type (normal vs cancer)
and the cellular composition of tumor tissue with respect
to tumor cell content and non-malignant cell subtypes such
as stroma cells and inflammatory infiltrates.
In individual patients the expression of more than
4,000 genes were altered and up to 60% of patients with
primary CRC showed more than a 2-fold expression
change in proteins and their phosphorylation, which is
in agreement with previous studies demonstrating cold
ischemia-related alterations in gene and protein expression
[4, 8]. In general, the impact on the molecular composition
was more severe in tumor tissue compared to normal
tissue, likely due to the higher activity of tumor cells
compared to normal cells. The most striking changes were
observed during warm ischemia and early cold ischemia
(10’ postsurgery); gene and protein expression changes
during prolonged cold ischemia were surprisingly less
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prominent though still significant. Interestingly, up to
690 (mean 118) genes were already affected in individual
patients by just clamping the hepatic pedicle for 10
minutes.
With regard to gene and protein expression data, we
observed inter-individual variability across patients. Most
of these patients, however, appeared to follow a similar
pattern of gene expression changes. By only using those
patients for further gene expression analyses, we were able
to identify significant up-regulation of several transcription
factors and signaling molecules of the extracellular matrix
such as cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61,
CCN1), and the regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1).
CYR61 is a matrix cell-adhesion molecule. Depending
on the context, it promotes cell proliferation, survival,
apoptosis, or angiogenesis by binding to distinct integrins
and plays an important role in wound repair [15]. RGS1
attenuates the signaling activity of G-proteins by fostering
GTP hydrolysis and has various immunomodulatory
functions [16]. Simultaneously, the expression of several
genes from colonic enterocytes was down-regulated.
On the protein level, the variability between patients
was also high. Protein levels and their phosphorylation
status showed increasing and decreasing levels between
different patients and timepoints. Variability was
higher in tumor tissue, probably because of the highly
heterogeneous cell composition, but also occurred
in homogeneous normal tissue. This implies that the
observed changes are to a large extent related to tissue
processing and not just variability in tumor cell content.
However, identification of tumor cell-specific events and
cancer cell biomarker requires analysis of isolated cancer
cells, which will be performed in follow-up studies.
However, the most consistent molecular change
during tissue resection and post-surgical ischemia was a
decrease in protein phosphorylation, observed for AKT,
MTOR, p70-S6K, GSK3B, and ERK1/2 from colon tissue.
Dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 is particularly interesting
with regard to the fact that an up-regulated gene expression
was found for dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1,
MKP1). This protein can dephosphorylate MAPK (ERK)
in the cell nucleus and thus attenuates MAPK signaling
[17].
Even in our highly standardized tissue processing
protocol, a comparison between frozen and formalin fixed
tissue is difficult because the slow formalin penetration
significantly prolongs the ischemia time (see Methods).
However, the decline in phosphorylation status observed
in frozen tissue had an influence on immunohistochemical
staining for pERK, pAKT, and pEGFR in colon tissue,
where staining intensity was often lower in postsurgery
compared to presurgery samples. This has important
consequences, since immunohistochemistry is frequently
used to determine activation of signaling pathways
in individual cancer specimens in order to determine
personalized treatment options. The pathologist analyzing

post-resection specimens needs to be aware of the
alterations that can be induced by cold ischemia time and
therefore needs precise information about the conditions
under which the tissue was procured. Since DUSP1,
CYR61, and RGS1 gene expression was up-regulated in
both normal and CRC tissue upon tissue resection, these
genes may represent interesting candidates for biomarkers
of post-resection tissue quality. Further evaluations by
RT-PCR and protein quantification; however, would be
needed for their characterization and validation as quality
biomarkers.
Our study also identified candidate “housekeeping”
or relatively stable genes, the expression of which was not
altered by tissue resection and post-surgical cold ischemia.
In this regard, the EEF1A1 gene appears to be particularly
interesting. Its CV was very low across all four timepoints,
both in normal colon tissue and in CRC tissue. EEF1A1
is known to be constitutively expressed in many tissues
and under various conditions and has been described as
a useful housekeeping gene for gene expression analyses
[18]. Further candidates for reference genes have been
identified. Interestingly, genes that are frequently used
as reference genes such as beta2-microglobulin or beta2tubulin did not show constitutive expression throughout
resection and post-surgical ischemia and therefore do not
appear suitable as housekeeping genes under the described
conditions.
The data presented herein are largely in agreement
with a recent report that described fluctuations of protein
levels and protein phosphorylation in human intestine
tissue samples as a consequence of different ischemic
conditions before preservation [8]. The authors reported
that a general trend towards up- or down-regulation
of proteins was not evident due to pronounced interindividual variability. We were able to demonstrate a
general trend towards up- and down-regulation of proteins
and their phosphorylation status due to a higher number of
samples that were investigated in our study, but confirm
the occurrence of high inter-individual variability. In
fact, we identified a majority of patients that responded
towards tissue resection with a common pattern of gene
expression changes, while some other patients responded
in a completely different manner. These inter-individual
differences require further investigation.
In summary, our data show a significant difference
in the molecular composition of tissue specimens collected
after tumor resection compared to specimens collected via
colonoscopy before tumor resection. This difference is
larger than the difference between various post-resection
times between 10 and 45 minutes. The observed effect
is either due to warm and cold ischemia, and/or the
anesthesia/surgical procedure itself, and the manipulation
of the tissue. The molecular changes induced during
and after tumor resection are heteromorphic and do not
occur in all patients. In general, kinase proteins become
dephosphorylated, which may result in decreased intensity

of immunohistochemical staining. The ratio between
phosphorylated and total HSP27 protein has emerged as a
promising marker for tissue quality, since it demonstrates
an almost linear increase with prolonged cold ischemia
time in all three tissue types.
This study presents an important contribution to
the understanding of molecular changes that are being
introduced into tissue samples during the pre-analytical
phase, i.e. by the tissue collection procedure itself and the
surgical procedures prior tissue collection. For the first
time, we provide a full list of genes whose expression is
altered due to tissue processing and surgical manipulation.
In addition, our findings suggest that the analysis of
regulatory pathway proteins and specific growth factor
receptors, such as EGFR, requires the use of highly
standardized and rapid tissue processing techniques. Once
standardized techniques have been validated, analysis of
the expression of regulatory pathway proteins may be
valuable as predictive markers of targeted therapies.

ONLINE METHODS
Patient enrollment
Fifty patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and
43 with hepatic metastasis of CRC who were scheduled
for tumor resection surgery gave informed consent to be
enrolled in the study. Only patients with a tumor larger
than 3 cm in diameter were enrolled. Patients who had
received chemotherapy or radiation therapy <3 weeks
before surgery were excluded. Specially trained study
nurses were present during all surgeries. They performed
tissue processing in the surgical unit and clinical data
documentation to assure that the same standardized
operating procedures have been applied to all patients. The
study was conducted at three sites in Hamburg, Germany,
and received approval by the competent ethics review
committee of the medical association Hamburg under
reference no. PV3342.

Tissue collection before and during surgery
After induction of anesthesia, patients with primary
CRC underwent a colonoscopy, upon which three biopsies
were taken from the tumor and three biopsies from the
adjacent normal tissue (presurgery) (Supplementary Figure
1). For patients with hepatic metastasis of CRC, four
pieces of tissue were taken from normal liver parenchyma
before the start of liver resection, i.e. just before clamping
of the hepatic artery (presurgery). About 10 minutes
after hepatic pedicle clamping (post-clamping), another
four tissue samples were collected from the normal liver
parenchyma (postsurgery).
For all patients, 12 tissue samples were each
11025

collected from the tumor tissue and the adjacent normal
tissue after resection of the tumor and adjacent normal
tissue. These 24 samples were divided into three groups,
each exposed to a cold ischemia time of 10 minutes (10’),
20 minutes (20’), and 45 minutes (45’), respectively.
To minimize variation because of formalin penetration
time (approximately 1 mm/hour), every tissue sample
had a similar size of approximately 5 x 5 x 5 mm and an
approximate weight of 120 mg. Since formalin penetration
is slow, samples were all fixed for 16 hours. For each
timepoint and tissue type (normal or tumor), half of the
tissues were immediately stored in the vapor phase of
liquid nitrogen, while the other half was immersion fixed
in 4% buffered formaldehyde (Supplementary Figure 1).

Ser424) duplex, GSK3B/pGSK3B(Ser9) duplex,
MEK1/2/pMEK1/2(Ser217/221) duplex and ERK1/2/
pERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204, Thr185/Tyr187) duplex.
Assays were performed using 10 µg of tissue lysate
according to the manufacturers’ instructions and analyzed
with the SECTOR Imager platform (MSD). Analyses were
conducted in triplicate and arithmetic mean values were
calculated. Mean values of post-surgery samples were
against presurgery samples from the same patient. The
percentage of phosphorylation was calculated according to
the formula: phosphorylation (%) = (DFx phosphorylated
protein)/(phosphorylated protein + total protein) x 100
with distribution factor (DF) = 2. If the phosphorylation
(%) was >100, DF was adjusted. In order to account for
inter-assay variation, lysates of stimulated human cells
were produced and employed as positive and negative
controls.

Processing of tissue specimens
All tissue specimens in formaldehyde were
immersion fixed for 16 to 72 hours. Thereafter, they were
weighed and placed in 70% ethanol for a maximum of 24
hours until further processing. Processing was conducted
with an automated system (Microm tissue processor STP
420 D Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) resulting in
the embedding of tissues in paraffin (Paraplast).
From each formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) and frozen in liquid nitrogen (FF) tissue specimen,
one section was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and
evaluated under a light microscope in order to verify the
presence of tumor and normal tissue, respectively. Tumor
content was 10–90% in tumor samples and 0% in all
adjacent normal samples.
After histological quality control, FFPE and FF
samples were selected for the following molecular
analyses: i) quantification of total and phosphorylated
protein by a medium-throughput enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay technology (Meso Scale Discovery
[MSD]); ii) semi-quantitative evaluation of protein
expression by immunohistochemistry; and iii) gene
expression profiling on total RNA extracts using an
Affymetrix whole genome chip (Supplementary Figure 1).

Immunohistochemistry
5 µm sections from FFPE tissue were mounted on
glass slides, air dried at 56°C overnight and subjected to
immunostaining using an automated platform (Ventana
Discovery XT, Tucson, AZ, USA). The following
primary antibodies and dilutions were used: pERK1/2
1:300, pAkt(Ser473) 1:30, pEGFR 1:110, pmTOR
1:130, pHer3 1:70 (all from Cell Signaling Technology
Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). After staining, sections were
treated with ascending ethanol concentrations and xylene
and were finally covered with Pertex (Medite GmbH,
Burgdorf, Germany). Sections were examined under a
light microscope by a pathologist. Tumor cell staining
was classified as absent, weak, moderate, or strong and
a staining score was calculated based on the extent of
staining according to the formula: score = 3 x percentage
of strongly stained tumor cells + 2 x percentage of
moderately stained tumor cells + 1 x percentage of weakly
stained tumor cells. All IHC staining protocols used within
this study are “fit for purpose” and validated according
to FDA guidelines, and staining procedures were also
conducted according to standard operating procedures.
Therefore, assays are controlled in terms of specificity
and accuracy.

Quantification of proteins
Forty FF specimens were used. Tissue lysates were
prepared by cutting and homogenizing a 20 µm slice
from each FF specimen. The resulting tissue lysate was
subjected to a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA
kit; Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) to determine protein
concentration. Quantification of proteins was conducted
using 96-well plates with capture antibodies based on the
assay platform from MSD (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The
following assay kits were used: HIF1alpha singleplex,
HSP27/pHSP27(Ser15) duplex, EGFR/pEGFR(Tyr1173)
duplex,
AKT/pAKT(Ser473)
duplex,
MTOR/
pMTOR(Ser2448) duplex, p70-S6K/pp70-S6K(Thr421,

Gene expression analysis
For gene expression analysis, total RNA was
extracted in duplicates from every frozen tissue block.
Briefly, tissues were homogenized and RNA was isolated
in two steps using phenol chloroform extraction and the
RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
quality was evaluated based on 18S and 28S ribosomal
RNA peaks using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies, Berlin, Germany). Only RNA samples

Statistical analysis of protein content measured on
the MSD platform and statistical analysis of staining scores
derived from immunohistochemistry was performed with
the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons
test, using the software system GraphPad Prism Version
5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The
significance level was 0.05.
Statistical analysis of changes in gene expression
was preceded by normalization using Affymetrix-PowerTools and log2 transformation. Symmetry of the data was
verified by mean versus average analysis and boxplots.
As a first approach towards statistical data analysis,
hierarchical clustering was performed using Spearman
correlation coefficient as distance measurement. The wardlinkage method was used to generate dendrograms. Since
technical replicates were clustered together in almost all
cases, these replicates were averaged and the average was
used in further condition clustering, separating samples
from normal tissue and those that originated from tumors.
Thereafter, separate data across all four timepoints was
clustered per individual patient, allowing patients to be
grouped into distinct partitions.
Separating normal colon tissue from CRC tissue
samples, only patients from the largest partition group
were used to compare intensity levels between presurgery
and 10’ postsurgery timepoints and presurgery and 45’
postsurgery timepoints. T-tests were performed and
p-values were calculated. Probe sets with p>0.001 were
excluded as were probe sets with <2 log-fold changes
in intensity. The overlap from both comparisons was
identified as a list of genes that were particularly
vulnerable to warm and cold ischemia. A list of all genes
sorted according to the smallest coefficient of variation
(CV) was used to identify genes that were apparently not
vulnerable to warm and cold ischemia.
For detailed comparison between the three different
cold ischemia time intervals, all samples taken at biopsy
were excluded from the colorectal data pool. After
exclusion, cluster dendrograms across the remaining
three timepoints were generated, allowing patients to be
grouped into distinct partitions. Patients from the largest
partition group were used to compare intensity levels
between presurgery and 10’ postsurgery timepoint and
presurgery and 45’ postsurgery timepoint. T-tests were
performed and p-values were calculated.
