BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer often experience fatigue and other symptoms that negatively impact their quality of
life. The current trial investigated the effect of melatonin on fatigue and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS:
Patients who were aged 18 years, had a histologically confirmed stage IV cancer (TNM Classification), and who reported feeling significantly tired were recruited from the palliative care unit at the study institution. The study was a double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled crossover trial. Patients received 1 week of melatonin at a dose of 20 mg or a placebo orally each night, before
crossing over and receiving the opposite treatment for 1 week. Between the 2 periods, a washout period of 2 days was implemented.
Outcomes were measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) and The European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Physical fatigue from the MFI-20 was the primary outcome. The primary analysis
was a complete complier analysis (ie, it included only those patients who had consumed at least 5 capsules per week and who had
answered the MFI-20 on days 1, 7, 10, and 17). Sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations including all randomized patients and all
patients completing the intervention were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were randomized. Fifty patients completed the
intervention and 44 patients were complete compliers. No significant differences between the placebo and melatonin periods were
found for physical fatigue, secondary outcomes, or explorative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, oral melatonin at a
dose of 20 mg was not found to improve fatigue or other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Cancer 2015;121:3727-36.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with advanced cancer often experience fatigue, depression, insomnia, loss of appetite, and pain, symptoms that
can have a profound impact on quality of life (QoL).1-6
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine; MLT), is a neurohormone primarily produced and secreted by the pineal gland. MLT secretion is closely tied to the circadian rhythm and under natural circumstances it is secreted in greater
quantities during the night.
When administered orally in doses between and 2 mg and 4 mg, exogenous MLT reaches peak concentrations after
52 to 60 minutes and has a half-life of 60 minutes.7 However, bioavailability varies greatly between subjects and doses
from 1 mg to 5 mg result in peak plasma levels ranging between 10 and 100 times that of normal.8
There are several reasons for believing that MLT may improve fatigue and QoL in patients with cancer. A study
regarding the sleeping patterns of patients with cancer described their sleep as being abnormal, with frequent interruptions
and the consequent need for sleep during the day.9 This disrupted sleeping pattern could be the result of, or eventually
result in, a skewed or unsettled circadian rhythm. Such disturbances can lead to fatigue and depression.2,5,10
MLT is a regulator of the sleep cycle and studies have shown that the use of oral MLT supplements may correct sleeping
patterns and improve sleep quality in healthy individuals aged >55 years.11 Patients with cancer generally have lower levels
of MLT than healthy controls.12,13 The lowered MLT levels and disrupted circadian rhythm in patients with cancer may

therefore contribute to their fatigue and lowered QoL. Previous studies have found an effect of MLT in cancer therapy. Several nonclinical trials have demonstrated that MLT
inhibits cell division in tumors,11,14-18 and several clinical
trials, primarily conducted by Lissoni et al,19-26 have shown
MLT to have a positive effect on survival in patients with
cancer.19,20,23 Studies by the same group have reported that
patients with cancer receiving MLT experienced improvements in depressive symptoms, asthenia, malaise, mood,
and weakness. Unfortunately, these articles did not specify
how and when the QoL-related outcomes were measured
and in the majority of cases they were not patient selfreported. Therefore, the validity of these results may be
questionable.
To our knowledge, no trials to date have investigated the effects of MLT on fatigue in patients with cancer. Given the role of MLT in the sleep cycle, the
lowered levels of MLT noted among patients with cancer, and the findings that MLT may improve sleep in
healthy persons aged >55 years, we found it relevant to
test this drug, with its favorable toxicity profile, in relation to sleep, fatigue, and other symptoms in patients
with advanced cancer. The primary objective of the current study was to determine whether oral MLT administered at night would reduce physical fatigue in patients
with advanced cancer who were being treated in a palliative care facility. The effect of MLT on other cancerrelated symptoms including mental fatigue, insomnia,
pain, emotional function, loss of appetite, and overall
QoL were also investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design

The trial was conducted at the Department of Palliative
Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The study consisted of 2 parts.
Part 1 was a prospective, double-blind, randomized,
crossover trial. Patients received either MLT or placebo
followed by a washout period of 2 days, after which the
patients crossed over and received the opposite of the first
week (Fig. 1). Both patients and investigators were
blinded to the order of administration.
Part 2 was a prospective, nonrandomized, openlabel study consisting of patients who had completed
part 1 and chose to continue with the MLT treatment.
Intervention

MLT at a dose of 20 mg and placebo were compounded
into capsules by Glostrup Pharmacy (Glostrup,
Denmark). All capsules were identical with regard to taste,
3728

color, and size. Patients were instructed to consume the
capsules orally each night approximately 1 hour before
going to sleep.
Patients

Patients were screened using the 15-item European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Version
(EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL).27 Eligible patients were aged
18 years, had histologically confirmed stage IV cancer28,
had provided written informed consent, and had
answered “quite a bit” or “very much” to the QLQ-C15PAL question “During the past week: were you tired?”
Patients with untreated anemia, untreated hypercalcemia, or systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg; those
receiving warfarin, various doses of methylphenidate, corticosteroids, or sleeping pills within the previous 2 weeks;
and/or those with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level
<0.5 or >5.5 mL/mL also were excluded, as were pregnant or lactating women and patients who were unable or
unwilling to provide informed consent or complete a
questionnaire.
Assessments and Measurements

In part 1 of the trial, patients received the MFI-20 and
EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaires at the beginning
and end of each treatment period (days 1, 7, 10, and 17).
In part 2 of the trial, the patients received the same
2 questionnaires at the end of each week.
The MFI-20 questionnaire consists of 20 items
forming 5 4-item scales: general fatigue, physical fatigue,
mental fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation.
The questionnaire was translated into Danish according
to EORTC guidelines and used in a Danish context
previously.29
The EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL measures QoL, functional status (physical and emotional functioning), and
symptom severity (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain,
dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation).
The questionnaire is an abbreviated version of the
EORTC QLQ-C30 developed for palliative care.27
Patients were asked to complete 3 additional items
developed for this trial by the end of part 1: they were
asked to evaluate in which week of the trial they had felt
the most tired, in which week they had experienced the
most sleeping problems, and in which week they had felt
the best overall.
To investigate serious adverse events, we registered
acute hospitalizations and deaths from the medical record

analysis.

Outcomes

Sample Size Estimation

The primary outcome of the current study was the difference in physical fatigue as measured by the physical
fatigue scale of the MFI-20 during part 1.30 Secondary
outcomes were the differences in fatigue, insomnia, loss of
appetite, pain, emotional functioning, and overall QoL
measured with the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL. Explorative
outcomes were the differences in the 4 other fatigue scales
in the MFI-20 and the 5 remaining scales in the EORTC
QLQ-C15-PAL.
Part 2 used the same measurements and outcomes as
shown above. However, in part 2 each outcome was
defined as the difference between scores recorded at the
start of part 2 (day 17) and every subsequent week for
5 weeks.

Previous studies from the study institution have shown
the standard deviation (SD) for a difference between
repeated measurements (3 weeks apart) in scales in the
MFI-20 to range from approximately 20 to 25 points on a
scale of 0 to 100 (unpublished data). To be considered of
clinical relevance, a difference of 10 points on a scale of
0 to 100 was deemed necessary.31 With a risk of type I
error of 0.05 with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and a
risk of type II error of 0.10 (90% power), each intervention
group needed between 22 and 26 patients for an SD of 20 or
25, respectively. From this, a sample size of 25 patients in
each group (ie, a total of 50 patients) was decided on.

Randomization and Blinding

Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either
MLT followed by placebo (arm 1) or placebo followed by
MLT (arm 2) by Glostrup Pharmacy. The allocation
sequence was generated by computer and block sizes
remained unknown to all investigators. The treatment
allocations were kept centrally and were concealed from
patients, investigators, and the study coordinators enrolling the patients. All patients who died or were acutely hospitalized were discussed with the principal investigator to
decide whether it could be a suspected unexpected serious
adverse reaction (SUSAR). After the death of 1 patient,
the blinding was broken for this patient by the sponsor
contacting Glostrup Pharmacy. This was done to rule out
the possibility of SUSAR. The patient’s allocation was
kept hidden from investigators and all other individuals

Statistical Analysis

The data were analyzed with SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).32 Outcomes for
arm 1 were calculated as the difference in mean change
scores between week 1 and week 2 (scores for day 7 to day
1-scores for day 17 to day 10). Outcomes for arm 2 were
calculated as the difference in mean change scores between
week 2 and week 1 (scores for day 17 to day 10-scores for
day 7 to day 1).
Before pooling the 2 groups, we tested primary and
secondary outcomes for period and carryover effect using
the calculations of Pocock.33 If these were satisfactory, we
continued to pool the data.
The primary analysis was a per protocol analysis
including only complete compliers, defined as those
patients who had consumed at least 5 capsules per week
for the 2 weeks in part 1 and who had answered the
MFI-20 on days 1, 7, 10, and 17. A Student t test for

paired data was used to evaluate the differences in mean
scores. A significance level of .05 was used for the primary outcome and a significance level of .01 was used
for the secondary outcomes to adjust for the familywise
error rate.
As a sensitivity analysis, an intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis including all 72 randomized patients using multiple imputations for missing values was conducted.34 A
total of 10 different data sets were created with imputations based on regression models with the following independent variables included: baseline scores on MFI-20
and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, treatment arm (MLT or
placebo in the first week), age, sex, diagnosis, and World
Health Organization performance score. An additional
sensitivity analysis including the 50 patients who had
completed the intervention, using multiple imputations
for missing values, was conducted. For the imputations,
3730

the MI and MI analysis procedure in the SAS statistical
software was used.
We used a sign test for independence to determine
which week the patients felt most tired, experienced the
most sleeping problems, and felt the best according to the
3 additional evaluation questions and to test for differences in the number of acute hospitalizations and deaths
during the week in which the patients received MLT versus placebo. Patients included in this analysis had consumed at least 1 capsule.
All outcomes for part 2 were explorative and
included complete compliers only. For part 2, complete
compliers were defined as those patients who had consumed at least 5 capsules per week and had completed the
physical fatigue scale of the MFI-20 on day 17 (T0), T1,
and at 1 of the T2, T3, T4, or T5 timepoints. P values
were calculated for T5 minus T0.

patients in each treatment arm withdrew before completing part 1 of the study. Of the remaining 50 patients, 44
were complete compliers. Of the 50 patients who completed part 1, 36 chose to continue in part 2, 18 of whom
completed the 5 weeks of treatment (Fig. 3).
Baseline characteristics of patients in arm 1 and arm
2 demonstrated slight overweight noted among patients
with breast cancer in treatment arm 2 and those with
gynecological cancer in treatment arm 1 (Table 1).

Permits

This trial was approved by the locoregional Ethics Committee (journal number H-C-2009-006), the National
Board of Health (journal number 2612-3953), and the
Danish Data Protection Agency (BBH-2009-02). It was
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (identifier 00925899)
in June 2009. The study followed good clinical practice,
and was monitored by the Good Clinical Practice unit of
the Copenhagen University Hospitals (journal number
2008-249).

Pocock calculations demonstrated no significant period or
carryover effect for primary (P 5 .47 and P 5 .14, respectively) or secondary outcomes.33 The data were then pooled.
Analysis of the primary outcome indicated no significant difference between MLT and placebo (Table 2).
The difference in change of the mean score was 2.8 on a
scale of 0 to 100 favoring placebo (P 5 .47). Similarly, the
ITT analysis demonstrated no significant difference
(Table 3), with a difference with regard to physical fatigue
of 22.1 favoring MLT (P 5 .56). The sensitivity analysis
of the 50 patients who had completed the intervention
demonstrated no difference (data not shown).
For the secondary outcomes, the complete complier
analyses demonstrated no significant effect of the intervention. A difference of 21.4 (P 5 .80) was found for fatigue
and overall QoL demonstrated a difference of 2.9 (P 5 .41).
The ITT analysis yielded similar insignificant results
(Table 3). No significant differences in the mean scores
for any of the explorative outcomes were found. The largest difference was observed for general fatigue (difference
of 28.7 favoring MLT [P 5 .09]).
The 3 additional questions showed that 14 patients
reported feeling the most tired while receiving MLT and
24 while receiving placebo (P 5 .14). Seventeen patients
reported having the least trouble sleeping while receiving
placebo and 11 while receiving MLT (P 5 .34). Twentyone patients reported feeling better overall while receiving
MLT and 11 while receiving placebo (P 5 .63).
There was no difference in the number of acute hospitalizations (6 patients receiving MLT vs 12 patients receiving
placebo) or deaths (1 patient receiving MLT vs 2 patients
receiving placebo) occurring during the 2 weeks (P 5 .30
and P 5.1, respectively) among the 71 patients who had
consumed at least 1 capsule. No SUSARs were recorded.

patients with advanced cancer receiving treatment in the
palliative medicine department.
We chose to conduct a per protocol analysis as our
primary analysis to adhere as closely as possible to the
original study protocol. Because we had a slightly higher
than expected SD of 26 and a slightly lower “complete
compliance,” the current study had an actual power of
70%.
An analysis of those patients who had completed the
intervention (50 patients) and the total number of
randomized patients (72 patients) was conducted using
multiple imputations and demonstrated results similar to
those of the primary analysis. Thus, the relatively low
power of the primary analysis was unlikely to be the cause
of the negative result.
The general trend noted among all study subjects
was toward a worsening of symptoms during the trial period, which, given the critically ill nature of the current
study participants, was to be expected. We were not able
to demonstrate an ameliorating effect of MLT on this
downward trend. Patients who are eligible for palliative
care are a heterogeneous group, with a wide range of
symptoms and underlying causes. Although poor quality
of sleep and disrupted circadian rhythm may contribute

to fatigue, factors such as infection, cachexia, anorexia,
nausea, pain, depression, and adverse effects of treatment
are likely to play a larger role. It may be the case that a
small effect of MLT is simply “drowned out” by the cumulative negative effects of terminal illness. Anecdotally,
our clinical investigator noted large improvements in
younger women receiving MLT.
Compared with consecutive patients referred to the
study institution during a previous study period, the
patients recruited to the current study were found to have
lower symptom scores according to the EORTC QLQC15-PAL and MFI-20, indicating a population of better
functioning patients than the average patient receiving
palliative care.1,35 This tendency also could be observed in
our relatively low dropout rates, deaths, and hospitalizations. However, there is no reason to believe that MLT
would have had a greater impact on patients with a higher
symptom burden.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire has been
thoroughly validated, and the shortened QLQ-C15-PAL
produces directly compatible scores.27,30 The MFI-20 has
been validated with a wide range of conditions and previous
studies have shown good internal consistency for all subscales in the MFI-20 and with a stable multidimensional

factorial structure.36,37 Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the MFI-20 to be sensitive in differentiating
between chronically ill and healthy populations as well as
able to identify changes in the MFI after other interventions
such as exercise, counseling, and pharmacological interventions.30,38-41
Despite the previous validation of the questionnaires
used herein, the 3 additional evaluating questions developed
for the current trial were originally included to provide an
additional source of comparison for results gathered from
the MFI-20 and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL. Although a
slight tendency toward patients feeling less tired while
receiving MLT was found from the additional questions,
this finding was not statistically significant and thus corroborates our primary results.
Strengths of the current study include the doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design,
the benefits of which include direct comparison of
the interventions under investigation among the same
patients, thereby eliminating between-subject variability.42 Our trial period of 1 week was initially selected to
ensure that any potential findings would be directly applicable in a clinical palliative setting, in which fast-acting
treatments with significant effects are preferable. Other
trials investigating oral MLT supplements in otherwise
healthy patients with insomnia have shown significant
improvements after a single dose using intervention periods of 5 to 7 days.43-45 This supports the timeframe chosen for the current study. However, we cannot rule out
that we could have found an effect of MLT if our intervention period had been longer.

Our MLT dose of 20 mg is unlikely to be the cause
of the negative results. Trials using the same or lower
doses have reported positive effects.46 Several studies
regarding the pharmacokinetics of MLT have demonstrated a large degree of variability in bioavailability ranging from 10% to 56% among healthy subjects, resulting
in a difference in serum levels of 10 to 100 times that of
normal values in individuals receiving the same dose. This
complicating factor introduces an element of uncertainty,
further obscuring results.11
A recent meta-analysis of 19 studies involving 21 trials on the use of MLT in patients with cancer found significantly lower occurrences of cancer-related symptoms
such as asthenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia and
improved 1-year mortality rates.46 Of the 19 studies
included, all but 1 were conducted by the group of investigators lead by Lissoni et al. None of the included trials
was blinded, and only 1 included details regarding randomization. Furthermore, the trials did not specify how
and when the potential effects of MLT on cancer symptoms were evaluated.19 Although this finding in and of
itself is not grounds for an inference of bias, it highlights
the need for further independent investigations.
We were unable to replicate the positive results of
previous studies. This also was the case in the study by Del
Fabbro et al.47 Although the purpose of their study was to
determine the effect of MLT on cancer-associated
cachexia, QoL was also measured and found not to differ
significantly from placebo controls.47
The current study investigated the potential use of
MLT in late-phase palliative treatment. As a patient’s

disease progresses, their symptoms, concerns, and challenges are constantly changing. It may well be that interventions that demonstrate no effect in the final stages of a
disease could make a difference if applied earlier.

Conclusions

15.

In the current trial, a dose of 20 mg of MLT taken orally
at night did not improve physical fatigue in patients with
advanced cancer. Furthermore, we were unable to identify
improvements with regard to any other symptoms measured with the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL or MFI-20. Further research is needed to determine whether MLT has a
role in the earlier stages of palliative care.
