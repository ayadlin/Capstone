BACKGROUND: Sunitinib was a standard initial therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Given the fact
that many patients progressed through many available therapies and antitumor activity had been demonstrated with
sequential vascular endothelial growth factor-targeting approaches, a retrospective review was performed of the experience of rechallenge with sunitinib in sunitinib-refractory mRCC. METHODS: mRCC patients who received sunitinib
therapy after disease progression on prior sunitinib and other therapy were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics, toxicity, clinical outcome, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) objective response rate,
and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-three mRCC patients who were rechallenged
with sunitinib were identified. Upon rechallenge, 5 patients (22%) achieved an objective partial response. The median
PFS with initial treatment was 13.7 months and 7.2 months with rechallenge. Patients with >6-month interval between
sunitinib treatments had a longer PFS with rechallenge than patients who started the rechallenge within 6 months
(median PFS, 16.5 vs 6.0 months; P ¼ .03). There was no significant difference in outcome to sunitinib rechallenge
based on number or mechanism of intervening treatments. Substantial new toxicity or significantly increased severity
of prior toxicity was not seen during rechallenge in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib rechallenge had potential
benefits and was tolerated in select metastatic RCC patients. Additional prospective investigation was warranted.

The treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) has significantly changed over the past several years with the addition of targeted agents inhibiting elements of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathways.1-7 Sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is a small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase portion of the VEGF family of receptors. Sunitinib has become a standard of care for initial therapy of good
and intermediate prognosis patients with mRCC based on significant advantages over interferon alpha in a phase III trial.2
Despite the benefits of existing agents, initial or eventual resistance develops in all patients. As such, many patients receive
multiple sequential therapies during the course of their disease. Given the lack of validated biomarkers to predict benefit
from any particular agent, current practice in the application of these agents is an empiric sequence of single agents.8
Patients with favorable underlying biology are the most likely to receive several therapies, and indeed, in the absence of
clinical trials of investigational agents, may progress through several currently Food and Drug Administration-approved
agents.
The mechanism of resistance to VEGF-targeting therapy in mRCC is based on hypotheses derived from preclinical
data and includes transition to alternative tumor-promoting pathways, up-regulation of alternative proangiogenic factors
(eg, angiopoietin, interlekin-8, platelet-derived growth factor), and inadequate target inhibition.9 In addition, the antitumor activity of sequential VEGF-targeting therapy has been previously identified in both retrospective and prospective series in mRCC.10-12 The precise mechanism by which a tumor progresses through a given VEGF-targeted therapy, and
then responds to the sequential administration of another VEGF-targeting therapy, is unknown. Based on these

considerations, it was hypothesized that rechallenge of
patients with a VEGF-targeting agent previously used,
specifically sunitinib, could be a reasonable strategy for tumor burden control. A retrospective review was thus
undertaken to describe the experience of rechallenge with
sunitinib in metastatic RCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective review was conducted in 7 centers across 3
different countries: the United States (Cleveland Clinic
Taussig Cancer Institute [CCF], Cleveland, Ohio; Dana
Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI], Boston Mass; Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH], Boston Mass; and Baylor
Sammons Cancer Center, Dallas Tex), Canada (Princess
Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario; Tom Baker Cancer
Center, Calgary, Alberta), and France (Institut Gustave
Roussy, Villejuif, France). Eligibility included patients
with confirmed metastatic RCC (any histology) who had
previously received sunitinib with disease progression or
intolerance, received 1 or more antitumor therapies subsequently, and then received sunitinib for a second time.
Data on both sunitinib treatment regimens, intervening
treatments, and prognostic factors based on the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Cleveland
Clinic Foundation (CCF) criteria were collected.13-15 Investigator-assessed objective response rate, percentage of
tumor burden shrinkage by Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST)16 and progression-free survival (PFS) were recorded. Review of patient data was
undertaken with the institutional review board approval
for chart review at each participating center, from clinical
trial data and tumor registry.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical data were summarized as frequency counts
and percents, and continuous variables were summarized
as medians and ranges. PFS, which was measured from
the start of treatment to documented progression, was
summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. McNemar
test was used to compare response rates between the 2
treatment periods and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used to compare PFS. The log rank test was used to compare PFS during the rechallenge phase in patients who
had a <6-month lag between termination of their initial
treatment with sunitinib and the start of the rechallenge
versus those with a 6-month or greater lag; and the Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to compare the 2 groups
with respect to the MSKCC risk stratification. All tests of

statistical significance were 2-sided and all analyses were
performed using SAS (version 8.0, SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC) and StatXact (version 6, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, Mass).

RESULTS
Initial Sunitinib
Twenty-four patients were initially identified. One
patient was excluded because of lack of intervening therapy between completion of initial treatment with sunitinib and rechallenge; and because the interval between
treatments was approximately 7 weeks. Patient characteristics and outcome associated with the initial sunitinib
treatment are summarized in Table 1. Most patients were
male, median age at first sunitinib therapy was 59 years,
and all but 2 (9%) patients had prior nephrectomy. All
patients had clear cell histology. Most patients had a Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) status of 90% to 100%.
Lung and lymph nodes were the most common sites of
metastatic disease. All patients on initial sunitinib were in
a clinical trial. Most patients had favorable or intermediate risk based on MSKCC risk group criteria for untreated
patients and 73% had a favorable or intermediate risk by
CCF tyrosine kinase inhibitor criteria.9-11 The starting
dose of sunitinib was 50 mg (schedule 4 weeks on followed by 2 weeks off) for all but 2 patients (37.5 mg). Initial sunitinib treatment produced a partial response rate of
65% and a median PFS of 13.7 months. All patients discontinued initial sunitinib for disease progression per investigator assessment and none for intolerance or adverse
effects of sunitinib.
Sunitinib Rechallenge
The starting dose of sunitinib for rechallenge was 50 mg
for 12 patients (52%), 37.5 mg for 9 patients (39%), and
25 mg for 2 patients (9%; Table 2). Rechallenge began a
median of 6.7 months after progression on the first sunitinib treatment. During the intervening period between
progression on the first sunitinib and rechallenge, 52% of
patients were treated with sorafenib or sorafenib and bevacizumab; 39% were treated with an mTOR inhibitor; and
26% were treated with both classes of drugs. Two patients
had radiotherapy and/or surgery and 1 patient received an
experimental VEGF receptor inhibitor, ABT869, on a
phase 1 trial. Specifics of intervening systemic treatment
were unavailable for 2 patients. Upon sunitinib rechallenge, 5 patients (22%) achieved a partial response
(including 1 patient with a best response of stable disease

The median PFS is estimated to be 7.2 months.
There was no difference in clinical outcome comparing
patients who received intervening systemic therapy versus
patients who received only intervening radiation and/or
surgery (data not shown). Comparing sunitinib treatment
periods, the median PFS with initial treatment with sunitinib in this cohort was 13.7 months compared with 7.2
months for rechallenge (PFS was longer with rechallenge
than with initial treatment in 6 patients [32%]). These
data suggest that, although rechallenge with sunitinib has
some efficacy, overall it appears less than that seen with
initial treatment; objective response is less frequent (P ¼
.006) and PFS is shorter (P ¼ .04). Figure 2 plots PFS for
both treatment periods. Exploratory analysis revealed that
patients with a >6-month lag between sunitinib treatments had better PFS with rechallenge than patients who
started the rechallenge within 6 months of discontinuing

MSKCC risk group—38% favorable, 63% intermediate
in the <6-month group compared with 92% intermediate
and 8% unfavorable in the >6-month group (P ¼ .03)

PFS at rechallenge compared with initial sunitinib had a
greater than 6-month interval. With regard to PFS on
rechallenge compared with initial objective response,
patients who achieved an initial partial response with sunitinib (n ¼ 15) had a median PFS of 8 months versus 6
months for patients (n ¼ 7) with a best response of stable
disease to initial sunitinib (P ¼ 0.1).
Table 4 compares the toxicities of initial treatment
and rechallenge for patients (n ¼ 20) with complete data
available. The most common toxicities experienced on
both initial treatment and at rechallenge were fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Noting the limitations
of toxicity recording outside of a clinical trial and the

5404

shorter duration of therapy with rechallenge, sunitinib
rechallenge does not appear to be associated with an
increased risk of toxicity. Substantial new toxicity or significantly increased severity of prior toxicity was not seen
during rechallenge in this cohort.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that patients with metastatic
RCC can demonstrate antitumor effect to sunitinib
rechallenge after failure of prior sunitinib therapy, as evidenced by objective responses and a median PFS of over 7
months. Although the clinical effects observed were less
than initial sunitinib treatment, rechallenge may be a viable therapeutic strategy in the select subset of patients who
are able to receive further therapy. In addition, sunitinib
rechallenge was associated with expected and acceptable
toxicity.
There are other examples within solid tumor oncology of drug rechallenge with clinical benefit. Ovarian cancer is an example in which the majority of women with
advanced ovarian cancer with initial response to cisplatinbased regimens and subsequent recurrence demonstrate a
second response to re-treatment with a platinum-based
regimen. Patients who recurred more than 6 months after
complete clinical response with a platinum-based regimen
have the best response to re-treatment.17-20 Successful
retreatment of lung cancer with gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor targeting endothelial growth factor receptor, has
been reported in several case reports. Of interest, after the
development of acquired resistance to gefitinib, the lung
cancer patients in these reports regained sensitivity to gefitinib after a several month gefitinib-free interval.21-24
Similar effect was observed in this RCC cohort in regards
to a greater time off prior sunitinib associated with a better
response, but response to prior sunitinib did not appear to
impact response at rechallenge within the limitations of
this small study.
The biology of tumor susceptibility to a drug after
previous exposure is unknown. In RCC, this is largely due
to the ill-defined biology of sunitinib resistance. If resistance involved a fundamental shift to an alternative tumorpromoting pathway not targeted by sunitinib, clinical
effect of re-treatment would not be expected. However,
the greater antitumor effect seen in patients with a longer
time off sunitinib suggests that, RCC may revert to a
greater VEGF reliance with increasing time off prior
VEGF-inhibiting therapy. Alternatively, resistance may
involve inadequate target inhibition either due to

enhanced receptor signaling or reduced drug levels from
physiologic changes. This resistance mechanism indeed
could be overcome with time off therapy and re-dosing.
Given the lack of data regarding sunitinib drug levels at
time of first resistance, this hypothesis would require prospective testing.
Another possible explanation is that metastatic renal
cancer, like other cancers, has been demonstrated to have
significant intratumoral heterogeneity.25-27 This heterogeneity creates an opportunity for Darwinian selection of
tumor subclones.28,29 In this model, selective pressure
from sunitinib causes drug-resistant clones to expand.
However, during treatment interruptions, the selective
pressure from sunitinib is removed. Without the selective
pressure from sunitinib, the drug-resistant clones no longer have a selective advantage and are outgrown by faster
growing drug-sensitive clones. This type of clonal selection has been observed in HIV where drug resistant
viruses frequently have poor ‘‘replicative fitness’’ compared with wild-type HIV.30,31 Although this model is
speculative, shifting populations of resistant and sensitive
tumor cells has been observed during imatinib treatment
in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
as well as in gefitinib treatment in lung cancer.32-34
This study has several limitations. The retrospective
nature of this review and the small number of patients,
even though from multiple centers, introduces several
biases. All tumor assessments were made by the investigators, limiting reliability and consistency of objective
response assessment and progression. There were heterogeneous treatments received between the initial and
rechallenge that might have affected the biology of the
tumors. This patient cohort is clearly highly selected as
evidenced by the high initial sunitinib objective response

rate and long PFS. Furthermore, toxicity recording outside of a clinical trial is imprecise; thus, the full toxicity
profile of sunitinib rechallenge remains to be defined.
Notably, the objective response rate and PFS with
sunitinib rechallenge were nearly identical to those in 2
separate trials, 1 of sunitinib in bevacizumab-refractory
RCC patients10 and axitinib in sorafenib-refractory RCC
patients.11 Collectively, these data support that metastatic
RCC remains to a greater or lesser extent VEGF driven
through the disease course. The biologic impact of prior
therapy as it relates to clinical outcome with subsequent
therapy is at present poorly understood. Thus, the optimal
clinical approach to the treatment-resistant RCC patient
is unknown, and will require careful prospective trials for
further insight. Sunitinib rechallenge has potential benefits in metastatic RCC patients. Prospective studies to
evaluate this strategy are needed. A prospective trial of
sunitinib rechallenge versus everolimus in sunitinib refractory patients is being planned. Other trials in sunitinib-refractory patients may consider a sunitinib rechallenge
control arm as a comparator.
