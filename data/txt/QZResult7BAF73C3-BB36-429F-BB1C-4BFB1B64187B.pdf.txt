Inhibition of ADP Ribosylation Prevents and Cures
Helicobacter-Induced Gastric Preneoplasia

Abstract
Gastric adenocarcinoma develops as a consequence of chronic inflammation of the stomach lining that is
caused by persistent infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Gastric carcinogenesis progresses
through a sequence of preneoplastic lesions that manifest histologically as atrophic gastritis, intestinal
metaplasia, and dysplasia. We show here in several preclinical models of Helicobacter-induced atrophic gastritis, epithelial hyperplasia, and metaplasia that the inhibition of ADP ribosylation by the small-molecule
inhibitor PJ34 not only prevents the formation of gastric cancer precursor lesions, but also efficiently reverses preexisting lesions. PJ34 exerts its chemopreventive and therapeutic effects by impairing Helicobacterspecific T-cell priming and TH1 polarization in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes. The subsequent
infiltration of pathogenic T cells into the gastric mucosa and the ensuing gastric T cell–driven immunopathology are prevented efficiently by PJ34. Our data indicate that PJ34 directly suppresses T-cell effector
functions by blocking the IFN-γ production of mesenteric lymph node T cells ex vivo. Upon exposure to
PJ34, purified T cells failed to synthesize ADP-ribose polymers and to activate the transcription of genes
encoding IFN-γ, interleukin 2, and the interleukin 2 receptor α chain in response to stimuli such as CD3/
CD28 cross-linking or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin. The immunosuppressive and chemoprotective effects of PJ34 therefore result from impaired T-cell activation and TH1 polarization, and lead to the
protection from preneoplastic gastric immunopathology. In conclusion, ADP-ribosylating enzymes constitute
novel targets for the treatment of Helicobacter-associated gastric lesions predisposing infected individuals to
gastric cancer and may also hold promise for the treatment of other T cell–driven chronic inflammatory
conditions and autoimmune pathologies. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5912–22. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Epidemiologic and experimental studies have established
unequivocally that chronic inflammatory diseases predispose
to cancers of the liver, cervix, colon, stomach, and several
other organs (1). In the stomach, chronic inflammation
caused by persistent infection with the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is the most important risk
factor for the development of adenocarcinoma (2–5). In a
high-risk subset of infected individuals, H. pylori causes multifocal corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, which frequently progresses to intestinal metaplasia, occasionally to

dysplasia, and rarely to adenocarcinoma (6, 7). We have
shown recently using a C57BL/6 mouse model of Helicobacter
infection that the early stages of this preneoplastic
sequence develop as a result of gastric infiltration by TH1polarized, MHC class II–restricted effector T cells (8). This
T-cell subset is, on the one hand, absolutely essential for
the efficient control of infection and, on the other hand
either directly or indirectly induces gastric epithelial transformation (8). Both phenotypes depend on IFN-γ, which is secreted by TH1-polarized effector T cells both locally at the
site of infection and in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph
nodes (MLN). Targeting T cells pharmacologically in the infectious process prevents and even reverses established premalignant lesions, confirming that T cells are crucial
mediators of gastric preneoplasia (9).
Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is synthesized by the PAR polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes, which use the substrate
NAD+ to ADP-ribosylate acceptor proteins (10–12). PARP
enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions,
and NAD+-mimicking inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation
efficiently block inflammation in rodent models of Crohn's
disease (13) and in allergen-induced airway inflammation
models (14), and protect mice from endotoxic shock (15).
Since the concept of synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors
in cells with defects in homologous recombination was

PARP Inhibition Cures Helicobacter-Induced Preneoplasia

introduced in 2005 (16, 17), PARP inhibitors have entered the
arena of cancer therapy, showing a benefit in breast and
ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient
tumors (18–21).
We show here that the T cell–driven gastric preneoplastic
immunopathology observed in Helicobacter-infected C57BL/6
mice is attenuated by systemic administration of PJ34, a
NAD+ analogue and inhibitor of ADP ribosylation originally
designed to inhibit PARP1 (22). The same treatment further
efficiently reversed preexisting lesions, especially when applied in combination with Helicobacter eradication therapy.
We find that PJ34 exerts its chemopreventive and therapeutic
effects by inhibiting the priming and programming of TH-1
polarized T cells in the gut-draining lymph nodes. An essential role for ADP ribosylation during T-cell activation was
further corroborated in vitro, as the PAR formation, cytokine
secretion, and proliferation induced by CD3/CD28 crosslinking were blocked by PJ34. In conclusion, we propose that
ADP-ribosylating enzymes in T cells may represent novel
targets for the treatment of gastric premalignant lesions in patients that are refractory to Helicobacter eradication therapy.

Materials and Methods
Animal experimentation, Helicobacter strains, and
pharmacologic treatments
Male C57BL/6, interleukin (IL)-10−/−BL/6, CD4−/−BL/6, and
MyD88−/−BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) as well as
PARP1 −/− BL/6 (23) and PARP2 −/− BL/6 (a kind gift from
Gilbert de Murcia, Intégrité du Génome, Unité Mixte de
Recherche 7175, Ecole Supérieure de Biotechnologie de
Strasbourg, Illkirch, France) were maintained in individually
ventilated cages and infected at 5 to 6 weeks of age with two
consecutive doses of ∼108 H. felis CS1 (ATCC 49179; ref. 24).
All animal experiments were approved by the cantonal veterinary office. For in vivo inhibition of ADP ribosylation, PJ34
[N-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide, Enzo Life Sciences] was administered in drinking
water supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL Aspartame, resulting
in a daily dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. In cell culture experiments, PJ34 and DAM-TIQ-A [2-Dimethylaminomethyl4H-thieno (2,3-c)isoquinolin-5-one; Enzo Life Sciences] were
each used at 15 μmol/L. Antibiotic eradication therapy
was achieved by 2 weeks of daily orogastric treatment with
4.5 mg/mL metronidazole, 10 mg/mL tetracycline hydrochloride (both Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.2 mg/mL bismuth subcitrate
(Park-Davis).
Assessment of H. felis colonization, gastric IFN-γ
production, gastric neutrophil and lymphocytic
infiltration, and histopathology
Murine stomachs were dissected longitudinally into equally sized pieces. For the assessment of H. felis colonization,
total genomic stomach DNA was subjected to quantitative
PCR analysis of the flaB gene, as previously described (8).
The quantitative analysis of gastric IFN-γ expression by
real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and the quantification of neutrophil infiltration by myeloperoxidase activ-

ity assay were performed as described (8). Gastric lymphocyte
single-cell suspensions were generated by digestion with
0.25 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) and passing through a cell
strainer. PARP1 expression was analyzed by immunoblotting of mucosal extract using rabbit anti-PARP1 antibody
H-250 (Santa Cruz). Gastric histopathology was graded on
Giemsa-stained paraffin sections as described in detail previously (8, 9). All pictures were taken with a Leica Leitz DM RB
microscope equipped with a Leica DFC 420C camera. Images
were acquired at ×20 magnification using the Leica Application Suite 3.3.0 software. Scale bars indicate 50 μm. The immunomagnetic isolation of lymphocytes from MLN and spleen,
and the assessment of lymphocyte proliferation as well
as IFN-γ and IL-2 expression by real-time RT-PCR and intracellular staining is described in the Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
P values were calculated using GraphPad prism 5.0 software. The significance of differences in histopathology categories was calculated by Mann-Whitney test, and the
significance of numerical differences was calculated by Student's t test. All in vitro assays were analyzed in triplicate and
are shown with SDs.

Results
Inhibition of ADP ribosylation by PJ34 in vivo
attenuates Helicobacter-induced atrophic gastritis
As ADP-ribosylating enzymes have been implicated in
chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and also
in the development and progression of certain neoplasms
(13, 14, 16, 17), we hypothesized that blocking ADP ribosylation in vivo would modulate Helicobacter-induced gastric
(pre) neoplasia. To validate the use of the NAD+ analogue
PJ34, an inhibitor of PARPs and of ADP ribosylation in general, we first used the standardized human AGS gastric epithelial cell culture model of H. pylori infection. PAR
formation could be detected in H. pylori–infected AGS cells
as early as 6 hours postinfection (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
The synthesis of PAR was completely blocked by the addition
of PJ34 (Supplementary Fig. S1B), implying that PJ34 readily
permeates into cultured cells and efficiently blocks all enzymes involved in Helicobacter-dependent PAR formation.
Experimental infection of C57BL/6 mice with the close
H. pylori relative H. felis mimics the human host's response
to the bacterium, with gastric lesions manifesting histologically as chronic atrophic gastritis accompanied by epithelial
hyperplasia and acidic mucus–positive metaplasia (8, 9, 25,
26). The formation of preneoplastic lesions is strongly accelerated in IL-10−/− mice, which develop atrophy, hyperplasia,
and metaplasia as early as 4 weeks postinfection (Fig. 1A)
compared with ∼12 weeks postinfection in wild-type (WT)
mice (8). IL-10−/− mice thus constitute a convenient model
for pharmacologic intervention.
IL-10−/− mice were given PJ34 with the drinking water at a
daily dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight. The quantitative analysis of gastric histopathology revealed that PJ34 treatment
strongly reduced Helicobacter-associated inflammation,

atrophy, and epithelial hyperplasia and, to a lesser extent, intestinal metaplasia (Fig. 1A). In agreement with the effects of
PJ34 on gastric histopathology, the mucosal infiltration of
neutrophils as determined by myeloperoxidase activity assay
was reduced in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 1B). PJ34
treatment further significantly impaired the clearance of
Helicobacter that is typically observed in IL-10−/− mice (Fig. 1C).
To clarify whether PJ34 exerts its protective effects through
inhibition of PARP1, the target for which PJ34 was originally
designed, we first analyzed PARP1 expression in the gastric
mucosa of infected and uninfected IL-10−/− mice (Fig. 1D).
All infected mice showed higher levels of PARP1 than their
age-matched uninfected counterparts; PARP1 levels were
not influenced by PJ34 (Fig. 1D). To investigate the functional
consequences of Helicobacter-associated PARP1 accumula-

tion in the gastric mucosa, we crossed IL-10−/− mice with
PARP1−/− mice to generate IL-10−/−/PARP1−/− animals. We
assessed the development of gastritis and preneoplastic
lesions in this strain over time compared with the PARP1proficient parental strain. Remarkably, no significant differences could be observed with respect to the onset or the
severity of lesions (5, 14, and 21 d postinfection; Supplementary Fig. S2), implying that PJ34 acts through mechanisms not
dependent only on PARP1 to attenuate Helicobacter-associated
gastric pathology in vivo.
Inhibition of ADP ribosylation by PJ34 reverses
preexisting lesions
We next examined a possible therapeutic effect of PJ34;
to this end, we had to abandon the IL-10−/− model, as these

mice clear the infection (Fig. 1C) and spontaneously revert
to normal gastric histology by 6 to 8 weeks postinfection
(data not shown). For therapeutic studies, we used CD4−/−
mice that develop premalignant lesions more consistently
than C57BL/6 WT mice by 3 months postinfection, creating
a therapeutic window for pharmacologic intervention between 3 and 4 months postinfection (Fig. 2). The increased
susceptibility of CD4−/− mice is presumably due to their
lack of a CD4+ regulatory T-cell population that could control the immunopathology induced by “pathogenic” effector
T cells, which are CD8+ in the absence of CD4+ T cells (27).
CD4−/− mice were infected with H. felis for 3 months, and
the development of premalignant pathology was confirmed
in a small control group (data not shown). The remaining
mice either received PJ34 in the 4th month postinfection or
remained nontreated. The treatment with PJ34 efficiently reduced all parameters of gastric histopathology (Fig. 2A). The
regression of lesions was accompanied by a significant reduction of gastric IFN-γ production and neutrophil infiltration

(Fig. 2B and C). In line with our previous observations
(8, 9), the reduction of IFN-γ and mucosal neutrophils was
associated with an increase in Helicobacter colonization
(Fig. 2D), which is indicative of a reversal to normal gastric
mucosal architecture and physiology.
The regression of preneoplastic lesions is not sustained
under conditions of ongoing Helicobacter colonization
To confirm these results in an independent model, we took
advantage of a mouse strain that lacks the gene encoding the
adaptor protein MyD88. MyD88−/− mice develop severe preneoplastic lesions as early as 1 month postinfection (Supplementary Fig. S3A), presumably due to a defect in immune
counter-regulation.3 However, in contrast to CD4−/− and IL10−/− mice, which efficiently reduce H. felis colonization or
even clear the infection, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2), MyD88−/−

mice are colonized heavily for at least 3 months postinfection
(Fig. 3). We used the therapeutic window between 1 and 3
months postinfection to test whether the reversal of preneoplastic lesions by PJ34 treatment would be sustained after
termination of the treatment, despite ongoing H. felis colonization, or would require the concomitant eradication of the
infection (Fig. 3).
MyD88−/− mice were infected for 1 month, and the development of pathology was verified in a small control group
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and D). The remaining mice either

received PJ34 for the subsequent month, were subjected to
eradication therapy in weeks 5 and 6 postinfection, or received both treatments. At 2 months postinfection, the reversal of preexisting lesions and the efficiency of eradication
therapy were verified in additional control groups (Supplementary Fig. S3B and D). All remaining mice were maintained for a 3rd month and then analyzed with respect to
their colonization and histopathology. Mice that had been
continuously colonized throughout the 3-month time course
had all developed severe pathology (Fig. 3A). The regression

of preneoplastic lesions induced by PJ34 treatment during
the second month was transient, as the mice relapsed once
the treatment was discontinued (Fig. 3A). In contrast, mice
that had been cured of their infection while receiving PJ34
showed sustained regression of their lesions, i.e., the effect
of the treatment was stable in this group (Fig. 3A). As reported previously (28), eradication therapy by itself was also
effective at reversing existing lesions (Supplementary Fig.
S3C and D), indicating that Helicobacter eradication and
the inhibition of ADP ribosylation have comparable effects
in mice. In contrast, eradication therapy typically fails to cure
the human counterpart lesions (29), suggesting that the consecutive treatment with antibiotics and ADP ribosylation inhibitors would have a beneficial effect over eradication
therapy alone in humans.
The effects on gastric histopathology were reflected in the
levels of neutrophil infiltration, which decreased more dramatically in the group that was subjected to both PJ34 treatment and eradication therapy than in the group that received
PJ34 only (Fig. 3B). Helicobacter levels were not significantly
different between the two infected groups with or without
PJ34 treatment; only background levels of Helicobacterspecific PCR products were detectable upon eradication
therapy (Fig. 3C). In conclusion, the pharmacologic inhibition
of ADP ribosylation for therapeutic purposes is temporarily
successful in reversing preexisting lesions, but is sustained
only if the underlying infection is eradicated.
Inhibition of ADP ribosylation prevents T-cell
priming in MLNs
We have reported previously that gastric IFN-γ responses
to Helicobacter infection correlate with the level of gastric
T-cell infiltration and preneoplastic pathology (8, 9). This
association was again confirmed in this study (Figs. 1 and
2). The proportion of T cells producing IFN-γ (i.e., TH-1–
polarized effector T cells) in the MLN is a reliable indicator
of Helicobacter-specific T-cell responses and a good predictor
of gastric pathology (9). To assess whether inhibition of ADP
ribosylation modulates gastric histopathology by interfering
with T-cell priming, we infected 10 WT C57BL/6 mice with
H. felis and treated one half of the group with PJ34 for
1 month. The rest remained nontreated; additional mice
served as uninfected, nontreated controls. IFN-γ–positive
T cells were quantified in single-cell MLN preparations of individual mice by intracellular staining for IFN-γ combined
with surface staining for CD4 (Fig. 4A). The proportion of
IFN-γ+ cells increased in the CD4+ and CD4− fractions as a
result of the infection; this increase was suppressed by PJ34
treatment (Fig. 4A). As a consequence of impaired T-cell
priming in the MLN due to PJ34 treatment, fewer leukocytes
were present in single-cell preparations of the corresponding
stomachs (Fig. 4B, top), and fewer of these gastric leukocytes
stained positive for CD4 (Fig. 4B, bottom). To test whether
the inhibition of TH-1 polarization was due to a direct effect
of PJ34 on IFN-γ production, we cultured single-cell preparations from five additional H. felis–infected WT mice for 3 days
in the presence or absence of PJ34. All treated cultures revealed a reduction of IFN-γ expression compared with the

www.aacrjournals.org

respective controls (Fig. 4C); the simultaneous visualization
of PAR showed that PJ34 indeed significantly reduced PAR
formation under these circumstances (Fig. 4C). Finally, we
pulsed immunomagnetically isolated MLN-derived dendritic
cells with Helicobacter sonicate and cocultured them with
splenic CD4+ T cells isolated from uninfected or infected
donors (Fig. 4D); the infection-dependent IFN-γ response
of the T cells was significantly reduced by PJ34 treatment,
as were the background levels of T-cell activation (Fig. 4D).
In conclusion, the T-cell priming, TH-1 polarization, and
IFN-γ production that are a prerequisite for the development
of gastric Helicobacter-associated pathology are blocked by
PJ34, suggesting that T cells represent the key target of
PJ34 in this scenario.
T-cell activation is impaired by inhibition of
ADP ribosylation
T-cell activation requires two external signals, an antigenspecific signal that is transmitted through the TCR/CD3
complex and a costimulatory signal received by activation
of CD28 (30). Primary T cells are induced to proliferate, to
express the activation marker CD25, and to produce and
secrete IFN-γ upon CD3/CD28 cross-linking or treatment
with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin
(Fig. 5). We isolated splenic CD4+CD25− T cells and stimulated
them with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody–coated
beads or PMA/ionomycin in the presence or absence of
either PJ34 or an alternative inhibitor of ADP ribosylation,
DAM-TIQ-A. Both treatments induced proliferation of the
T cells as assessed by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution, and proliferation was blocked
by both compounds (Fig. 5A). PJ34 was more active than
DAM-TIQ-A at the same final concentration. The concomitant upregulation of CD25 was reduced as well (data not
shown; Fig. 6B), as was IFN-γ production (Fig. 5C). We
conclude that inhibition of ADP ribosylation by either PJ34
or DAM-TIQ-A significantly blocks CD4+CD25− T-cell activation triggered by two alternative stimuli.
To investigate whether the effect of blocking ADP ribosylation was attributable to either PARP1 or PARP2, we stimulated parallel preparations of immunomagnetically isolated
WT, PARP1−/−, and PARP2−/− CD4+CD25− T cells by CD3/
CD28 cross-linking in the absence or presence of PJ34 and
quantified their proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4). T cells
of all three genotypes responded equally well to CD3/CD28
cross-linking; no differences were detected with respect to
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4), CD25 upregulation,
or IFN-γ production (data not shown). Furthermore, we
found that PJ34 had similarly suppressive effects on all three
genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that neither
PARP1 nor PARP2 are the sole targets of PJ34 in T cells.
To test whether T-cell inhibition by PJ34 is restricted to
CD4+ T cells or is a common feature shared by other T-cell
subsets, we immunomagnetically isolated splenic CD8+ T
cells, subjected them to CD3/CD28 cross-linking, and measured their proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5). PJ34 treatment indeed blocked the proliferation of CD8+ T cells as
efficiently as that of CD4+ T cells, implying that PJ34 has

broad T-cell immunosuppressive capacity. Interestingly,
splenic CD4 + T cells isolated from PJ34-treated mice at
the time of sacrifice were as responsive to CD3/CD28 crosslinking–induced activation as cells from nontreated donors
(data not shown), suggesting that the effects of PJ34 in vivo
are transient and do not permanently silence this important
branch of the immune system. In conclusion, PJ34 acts as an
efficient T-cell immunosuppressant in vitro, suggesting that
it may target T cells in a similar manner also in vivo.
Inhibition of ADP ribosylation blocks il-2 and ifng
gene transcription
Activated T cells require IL-2 for growth (31); therefore,
some of the earliest markers of T-cell activation are the upregulation of the high-affinity α-chain of the IL-2 receptor
(CD25; Fig. 5B) and the production of IL-2. IL-2 acts on the
producing T cell and its neighbors to sustain their proliferation in an auto and paracrine manner (31). To monitor PAR
formation during early stages of T-cell activation upon CD3/
CD28 cross-linking, we stained intracellular ADP-ribose polymers after 2, 6, and 16 hours with an antibody that recognizes polymers >16 units in length. PAR formation
gradually increased in this time frame and was blocked efficiently by PJ34 (Fig. 6A). Transcription of the il-2 and ifng
genes was detectable as early as 2 hours after CD3/CD28
cross-linking (Fig. 6B and C) and remained high after 6 and

www.aacrjournals.org

16 hours (data not shown). The induction of il-2 and ifng
transcripts could be prevented by PJ34, but was independent
of PARP1 and PARP2 (Fig. 6B and C), suggesting that the two
PARP family members are redundant or that additional PJ34sensitive ADP-ribosylating enzymes function in the transcriptional activation of T cells. The results indicate that PJ34
blocks T-cell activity by interfering with the autocrine, IL2–driven positive feedback loop required for sustained T-cell
proliferation, and suggest that ADP ribosylation is required
for the initiation of the transcriptional program activating
T-cell effector functions.

Discussion
Inhibitors of ADP-ribosylating enzymes have attracted attention lately as new compounds for cancer therapy (16, 17,
19, 20), and for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases
and autoimmune pathologies (13–15, 32). We show here that
a broad range inhibitor of ADP ribosylation, PJ34, is capable
of preventing and also of curing the Helicobacter-associated,
T cell–driven immunopathology that precedes gastric cancer development. Several pieces of evidence indicate that
pathogenic T cells, and not Helicobacter-infected epithelial

exclusively by infiltrating CD4+ T cells, is strongly reduced
in vivo; (b) the priming and polarization of TH1 T cells in
the gut-draining lymph nodes is impaired both in vivo and
ex vivo in cocultures of T cells with Helicobacter antigen–
pulsed MLN-derived dendritic cells; (c) IFN-γ secretion by
explanted MLN cells from infected mice cultured ex vivo is
blocked, and (d) these effects are presumably due to the
PJ34 sensitivity of il-2 gene transcription as shown in an
ex vivo model of T-cell stimulation.
ADP-ribose polymers are detectable in T cells only hours
after their activation by CD3/CD28 cross-linking; the time
frame of PAR formation suggests a role for PAR in the transcriptional activation of genes encoding IL-2, IFN-γ, and the
IL-2 receptor α-chain. In line with this observation, the inhibition of ADP ribosylation in T cells by PJ34 blocks il-2 and
ifng gene transcription and, presumably as a consequence of
these early effects, prevents T-cell proliferation in response
to CD3/CD28 cross-linking– and PMA/ionomycin-induced
activation. Our ex vivo results suggest that PARP1, PARP2,
and possibly other PJ34-sensitive PARP family members have

redundant roles during T-cell activation. Our finding that IL10−/−/PARP1−/− mice develop gastritis and epithelial pathology with similar kinetics as the parental IL-10−/− PARP1+
strain argues in favor of a redundant role of PARP enzymes
also in vivo. We conclude from the combined results that
ADP ribosylation by PJ34-sensitive enzymes is an essential
step in the activation and/or TH1 polarization of pathogenic
T cells, which directly cause the gastric pathology preceding
gastric neoplasia.
The concept of treating T cell–driven diseases such as
chronic inflammatory disorders or autoimmune diseases
with inhibitors of ADP-ribosylating enzymes is not new.
PARP inhibitors have for instance been successfully used
in preclinical models of asthma and colitis (13, 14, 33–35).
PARP inhibition and PARP1 gene deletion were shown to
protect mice from ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation (14). In rodent models of Crohn's disease–like colitis,
the inhibition of ADP ribosylation was sufficient to prevent
disease (13, 33–35). Protection was accompanied by decreased levels of inflammatory and T cell–derived cytokines

Figure 6. CD3/CD28 cross-linking–induced PAR formation and il-2 and ifng gene transcription are blocked by PJ34. A, PAR formation in CD4+CD25− T
cells upon CD3/CD28 cross-linking was analyzed by intracellular staining; cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28–coated beads in the presence or
absence of 15 μmol/L PJ34 for 2, 6, and 16 h as indicated. Representative dot plots (top) as well as the averages of triplicate cultures (bottom) are shown.
B and C, parallel cultures treated for 2 h as described in A were subjected to RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR analysis of il-2 (B) and ifng (C)
gene expression. Parallel CD4+CD25− T-cell cultures from PARP1−/− and PARP2−/− mice were included as well. Transcript levels of il-2 and ifng were
normalized to rps12 levels. Columns, mean; bars, SD.

PARP Inhibition Cures Helicobacter-Induced Preneoplasia

and a restoration of colonic barrier functions (13, 33–35).
Overall, substantial preclinical evidence is available to support a role for ADP ribosylation also in other T cell–driven
immune and autoimmune pathologies, suggesting a more
general mechanism and a broad applicability of ADP ribosylation inhibitors to these indications.
One of the least anticipated findings of our study was the
almost complete reversion of preexisting Helicobacterinduced gastric lesions by PJ34 treatment. This result indicates that inhibitors of ADP ribosylation, for which safety
data are now available due to their extensive testing in
trials of metastatic breast and other cancers (19, 20), might
be useful compounds for the treatment of symptomatic
H. pylori–infected patients. Most patients presenting with
atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, or dysplasia are routinely
subjected to eradication therapy targeting the underlying
infection; however, eradication is only partly efficient in reversing atrophy and fails in the treatment of metaplasia and
dysplasia (29). As patients with any of these conditions have
an at least 10-fold increased risk of developing gastric cancer compared with histologically unapparent infected individuals, and are currently subjected to an unsatisfactory
watch-and-wait strategy, there is a clear unmet need for
new treatment options for this patient group. We conclude
based on the results obtained by our combined treatment
with PJ34 and antibiotics that this inhibitor, or other compounds mimicking NAD+, may successfully reverse gastric

preneoplastic lesions in humans if administered together with
or after eradication therapy. In summary, we provide evidence
that ADP ribosylation is required for T-cell activation, and
that inhibition of ADP-ribosylating enzymes efficiently impairs the TH-1–polarized T-effector cell responses and the associated gastric immunopathology that are a hallmark of
chronic Helicobacter infection.
