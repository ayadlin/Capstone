Abstract
Activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor
KB (NFKB)–dependent transcription is required for tumor
promotion in cell culture models and transgenic mice.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) blocks AP-1 activation by
dimerizing with Jun or Fos family proteins and blocks NFKB
activation by interacting with NFKB p65. Two-stage [7,12dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] skin carcinogenesis experiments
in a model relevant to human cancer risk, transgenic mice
expressing human papillomavirus 16 E7 oncogene (K14HPV16-E7), show E7-enhanced tumor promotion. A cross to
K14-TAM67–expressing mice results in dramatic inhibition of
tumor promoter–induced AP-1 luciferase reporter activation
and papillomagenesis. Epithelial specific TAM67 expression
inhibits tumorigenesis without affecting TPA- or E7-induced
hyperproliferation of the skin. Thus, the mouse model
enriches for TAM67 targets relevant to tumorigenesis rather
than to general cell proliferation or hyperplasia, implicating
a subset of AP-1– and/or NFKB-dependent genes. The aim of
the present study was to identify target genes responsible for
TAM67 inhibition of DMBA-TPA–induced tumorigenesis.
Microarray expression analysis of epidermal tissues revealed
small sets of genes in which expression is both up-regulated
by tumor promoter and down-regulated by TAM67. Among
these, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2/Ptgs2) and osteopontin
(Opn/Spp1) are known to be functionally significant in
driving carcinogenesis. Results identify both Cox-2 and Opn
as transcriptional targets of TAM67 with CRE, but not NFKB
sites important in the Cox-2 promoter and an AP-1 site
important in the Opn promoter. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2430–8]

Introduction
Tumorigenesis is a multistage process involving the transformation of genetically altered ‘‘initiated’’ cells to benign lesions that
progress to malignant carcinomas with distant metastases. A single
mutagenic event, however, does not produce a cancer. Additional
genetic and epigenetic events are required for tumorigenesis and
tumor progression. Tumors are produced by chronic exposure of
the initiated epithelial and normal stromal cells to tumor-

promoting compounds. In the case of human cancer, there is
generally chronic exposure to a combination of tumor promoters.
Cervical cancer, for example, is initiated in young adults by infection
with a high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV), such as HPV16.
Cervical cancer development may then be promoted by decades of
exposure to estrogen, as well as the HPV16-E7 oncoprotein, which
has been shown in in vivo mouse models to act during the
promotion stage to enhance tumorigenesis (1–3). Tumor promoters
induce inflammation, cell proliferation, and other reversible cellular
effects. The rate-limiting steps of carcinogenesis occur during
promotion and progression. Understanding the molecular basis of
these rate-limiting steps is important for the prevention of cancer.
Studies by our laboratory (4–9) and others (10–12) using in vitro and
in vivo models have indicated that activator protein 1 (AP-1) and
nuclear factor nB (NFnB) activation are driving forces during tumor
promotion and progression, although skin carcinogenesis seems to
be unique in not requiring NFnB (13).
The AP-1 transcription factor is composed of structurally related
Jun and Fos family proteins that form DNA-binding dimers and
control the transcription of certain target genes. The AP-1 family
members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, cFos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) can form a
variety of Jun homodimers and Jun/Fos heterodimers that bind
similar DNA elements. A basal level of AP-1 activity is required for
normal cellular function (14–16). Elevated AP-1 activity levels,
however, can drive tumor progression (7, 9, 10, 17, 18). A dominantnegative transactivation deletion mutant of c-Jun (TAM67) inhibits
AP-1 activity by dimerizing with wild-type AP-1 proteins to yield
low-activity dimers containing only one transactivation domain.
Transgenic expression of TAM67 in the mouse skin inhibits 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–induced but not basal AP-1
transactivation and protects against both TPA-induced and
E7-enhanced two-stage skin carcinogenesis (7, 9).
Expression of TAM67 inhibits not only AP-1, but also NFnB
activity. NFnB is a transcription factor composed of dimers of
REL family proteins: RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, NFnB1/p105, and
NFnB2/p100 (19, 20). p100 and p105 are processed to release p50
and p52, respectively. The REL family proteins form homo- and
heterodimers capable of binding DNA elements in the promoter
regions of NFnB target genes (19, 20). NFnB is a key mediator
of many cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell growth, and
differentiation. NFnB is activated by a wide variety of extracellular
stimuli, including known tumor promoters such as TPA, tumor
necrosis factor a, UV, and stress. Inappropriate transactivation of
NFnB is associated with neoplastic transformation (21), whereas
specific inhibition of NFnB blocks tumorigenesis (22, 23). TAM67
was previously shown to bind RelA/p65 and to specifically inhibit
the expression of target genes responsive to NFnB in human
keratinocytes (8).

Dominant-Negative AP-1 (TAM67) Targets Cox-2 and OPN

AP-1 and NFnB synergize during tumorigenesis. TAM67 expression blocks the activities of both AP-1 and NFnB. TAM67 inhibits
TPA-induced and HPV16-E7–enhanced tumorigenesis without
blocking hyperproliferation or cell survival (9). The biology of the
mouse model thus enriches for genes that are functionally
significant for tumor promotion or progression. In this study, we
sought to identify genes that are important targets of TAM67 when it
specifically inhibits tumorigenesis. We examined the gene expression profiles of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)–initiated,
TPA-induced K14-HPV16-E7 transgenic and wild-type mouse skin in
the presence or absence of TAM67 expression. We hypothesized that
a limited number of genes are targets for regulation by TAM67 under
conditions known to inhibit skin carcinogenesis. The analysis
identified several genes important for tumor promotion and
progression, including cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), osteopontin
(Spp1/Opn), Cxcl1/Gro a, Alox5AP, matrix metalloproteinase 10
(MMP-10), and urokinase plasminogen activator as targets of
TAM67. The well-recognized molecular target for chemoprevention,
cyclooxygenase-2 (Ptgs2/Cox-2), was among only six genes downregulated by TAM67 expression under all of the tumor promotion
conditions tested. This is the first report of in vivo suppression of
Cox-2 and Opn transcription by TAM67 under conditions in which
TAM67 specifically inhibits tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Mice. The K14-TAM67/B6D2 mouse expresses dominant-negative c-Jun
(TAM67) in squamous epithelia under the control of the human K14
promoter (7). The K14-HPV16-E7/FVB mouse expresses the HPV16-E7 gene
under the control of the K14-promoter (24). K14-TAM67 mice were crossed
with K14-HPV16-E7 mice. The offspring from the four possible genotypes,
K14-TAM67/K14-HPV16-E7, K14 TAM67, K14-HPV16-E7, and wild type,
were used in gene expression studies and isolation of primary keratinocytes.
Transgene-positive mice were determined by PCR of tail DNA, as described
by Young et al. (7). Mice were housed and cared for in accordance with the
recommendations for the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
DMBA/TPA treatment. Groups of 8-week-old E7/TAM67, E7, TAM, and
wild-type sibling mice were initiated with DMBA (400 nmol per 200 AL of
acetone) and, 2 weeks later, treated with a single dose of TPA (10 nmol in
200 AL of acetone) as described by Young et al. (7). Tissues for RNA and
protein expression were harvested from the animals after cervical
dislocation.
Total RNA extraction. Full thickness dorsal skin was harvested 6 h after
TPA treatment and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Epidermis was separated
from the dermis as previously described (25). The epidermal tissue was
homogenized in a guanidinium-based lysis solution and extracted
sequentially with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and acid-phenol/
chloroform. Total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer’s directions
for the ToTALLY RNA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Total RNA isolated
from the epidermis was then subjected to microarray analysis.
Microarrays, labeling, and hybridization of RNA samples. Gene
expression patterns were determined using spotted microarrays containing
22,000 Compugen (San Jose, CA) oligonucleotides representing mouse genes
manufactured by the National Cancer Institute/Laboratory of Molecular
Technology. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA was generated by reverse transcription of 20 Ag of total RNA according to standard protocols using
SuperscriptIII indirect cDNA labeling system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
Cy3/Cy5-monoreactive dyes (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp., Piscataway,
NJ). Cy3-labeled test samples and Cy5-labeled universal control (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA) cDNA samples were combined and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Samples were diluted in
F-hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5 SSC, 0.1% SDS containing 10 Ag
mouse Cot-1 DNA, 10 Ag polydA, and 4 Ag tRNA) and hybridized to 22K
oligonucleotide array slides overnight at 42jC. The slides were then washed

www.aacrjournals.org

at room temperature with (a) 2 SSC and 0.1% SDS; (b) 1 SSC and 0.1%
SDS for 2 min; (c) 0.2 SSC for 2 min; and (d) 0.05 SSC for 10 to 20 s, and
finally dried by centrifugation at 50  g for 10 min. Three to four independent epidermal RNA samples were analyzed for each set of conditions.
Data acquisition and analysis. Microarrays were scanned and
processed using a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner in combination with
GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA).
Data analysis was done using the MADb program suite4 and Microsoft
Excel. For each hybridization, mean intensity minus median background
ratios were normalized by the median ratio of all genes found in that
experiment. Data sets representing differentially expressed genes were
selected according to the following filtering criteria: (a) data obtained from
at least 50% of all arrays analyzed in this study (i.e., 15 of 29 arrays); (b)
mean intensities beyond the threshold set at 500 units and at least 2 SD
above background; and (c) mean signal differences >1.5-fold for ratio
comparisons of cDNAs derived from three independent mouse epidermal
tissue samples harvested from TAM67 transgenic and nontransgenic litter
mates for each treatment group. Further filtering was done to identify genes
induced by tumor promoter and more than 4-fold inhibited by TAM67 with
induction completely blocked by TAM67. A pooled t test was applied to this
completely blocked set of genes. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the flow
diagram used for sequential filtering, statistical analysis, and quantitative
PCR confirmation.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Genes to be
analyzed for status as transcriptional targets of TAM67 were first subjected
to quantitative PCR to confirm tumor promoter induction and TAM67
inhibition of induction. The same RNA samples (at least three per set of
variables) used for hybridization were applied to real-time quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR for confirmation of the microarray data. cDNA
synthesis was done according to standard protocols using SuperscriptIII
(Invitrogen) with oligodT as primer. Production of gene-specific fragments
was measured real time based on standard TaqMan (Molecular Beacons,
Newark, NJ) protocols, with h2-microglobulin (B2m) serving as a
standardization control.
Western analysis. For isolation of protein from mouse epidermis, full
thickness dorsal skin was harvested 6 h after TPA treatment and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen. The epidermis was dissected away from the
dermis and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH, 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton
X-100, and complete miniprotease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN)]. The lysate was incubated at 4jC for 10 min, centrifuged at 12,000  g
for 20 min, and supernatant containing total protein was processed for
Western analysis. Protein concentrations were assayed with the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL). Equal amounts
of protein were separated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunodetection using the requisite
primary and secondary antibodies. Antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnolgy (Santa Cruz, CA).
Plasmids. A series of mouse Cox-2 promoter reporter plasmids,
including 963/+70, 547/+70, 203/+70, 203 Ebox mutant, 203 NFIL6
mutant, and 203 Ebox/NFIL6 double mutant, was kindly provided by
Susan M. Fischer (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; ref. 26).
The 203/+70 construct was used as a template to generate site-directed
mutants of AP-1 like sites at positions 69 (AGAGTCA to AGAGTTG) and
+34 (TCAGTCA to TCAGTTG). Quick Change II Site Directed Mutagenesis
(Stratagene) methodology was employed to produce these mutations. Sitespecific mutations were confirmed by sequencing. A deletion series of
mouse Opn promoter reporter plasmids including 772/+79, 88/+79, and
50/+79 subcloned from pSDKlacZpA Opn promoter constructs (kindly
provided by David Denhardt, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ) by PCR.
The PCR products were cloned into Topa-TA 2.1 (Invitrogen), then cut with
KpnI/XhoI and cloned into pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI).
Cell culture: mouse JB6 cells and primary epidermal cells.
Transformation-sensitive (P+) mouse epidermal JB6 cells were grown as

Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) ratio. After 24 h, the medium was
replaced with 0.5 mL fresh EpiLife medium containing 0.05 mmol/L CaCl2
and 50% supplements. After 18 h, the cells were treated with 10 nm TPA
or DMSO (as described in the figure legends). After 24 h, the cells were
lysed with 1 passive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase
activity as previously described (28).

Results

Figure 1. Genes are oppositely regulated by tumor promoter and TAM67.
Genes in which expression is oppositely regulated by tumor promoter and
inhibitor TAM67 constitute f9% of informative genes, whereas the subset of
oppositely regulated genes down-regulated by TAM67 constitutes f5%.
Comparative gene expression profiling of DMBA-initiated, TPA-induced
K14-HPV16-E7 transgenic or wild-type epidermal tissue in the presence or
absence of transgenic K14-TAM67 expression was carried out using three to
four independent samples of epidermal RNA for each set of conditions. Changes
in gene expression were analyzed by cohybridization of differentially labeled
test (mouse epidermal) and control (mouse universal) cDNAs derived from these
RNAs onto 20,000 oligonucleotide microarrays. Genes of interest were
required to be oppositely regulated by the tumor promoter (TPA or E7 or both) in
the absence of TAM67 and by TAM67 in the presence of tumor promoter (A )
and exhibit a minimum of 1.5-fold increase in expression with tumor promoter
and 1.5-fold inhibition by TAM67 (B). A, the overlap pattern of genes found to be
oppositely regulated by TAM67 and each of the three tumor promotion regimens.
B, the subset of genes in which mRNA expression was down-regulated by
TAM67.

A limited number of genes are targets for regulation by
dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) under conditions in which
two-stage skin carcinogenesis is inhibited. To identify genes
regulated by AP-1 or NFnB that play a critical role in tumor
promotion, we did comparative gene expression profiling of
DMBA-initiated, TPA-induced K14-HPV16-E7 transgenic or wildtype epidermal tissue in the presence or absence of transgenic
K14-TAM67 expression. Previous studies have shown that papillomagenesis and subsequent progression to carcinomas is markedly
inhibited by the expression of TAM67 (7, 9). To study the differences in gene expression in response to tumor promoters in the
presence and absence of TAM67, total RNA was collected from
mouse epidermis of each genotype (wild type, TAM67 transgenic,
E7 transgenic, or double transgenic) that had been initiated with
DMBA and treated with a single dose of TPA or solvent control for
6 h. Changes in gene expression were analyzed by cohybridization
of differentially labeled test and universal control cDNAs derived
from these RNAs onto spotted microarrays containing 20,000
Compugen oligonucleotides. Because TAM67 expression shows
little or no effect on basal AP-1–luciferase activation (5, 7), but
markedly inhibits tumor promoter–induced AP-1–luciferase, we
sought to identify TPA-, E7-, and E7 plus TPA-induced genes that
were suppressed by TAM67 expression. The genes of interest had to
meet the following criteria. They must (a) be informative on 50%
of all arrays; (b) be oppositely regulated by the tumor promoter
(in the absence of TAM67) and TAM67 (in the presence of tumor
promoter); and (c) exhibit a minimum of 1.5-fold increase in
expression with tumor promoter and 1.5-fold inhibition by TAM67
in TPA-treated samples. The flow diagram for sequential filtering is

described previously (4). Epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from
newborn mice as previously described (27), with minor modifications.
Primary cultures were isolated in EpiLife media (Cascade Biologics, Portland,
OR) containing 10% chelexed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1.8 mmol/L CaCl2,
bovine pituitary extract (0.2% v/v), bovine insulin (5 Ag/mL), hydrocortisone
(0.18 Ag/mL), bovine transferrin (5 Ag/mL), human epidermal growth factor
(0.2 ng/mL), 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin sulfate,
and 0.25 Ag/mL amphotericin B. Keratinocytes were initially plated in
fully supplemented serum-free EpiLife media (Cascade Biologics) adjusted
to 0.275 mmol/L CaCl2. After attachment occurred, primary cells were
maintained in fully supplemented serum-free EpiLife media (Cascade
Biologics) adjusted to 0.05 mmol/L CaCl2 at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2 in air.
Transfection and luciferase activity assay. Transformation-sensitive
(P+) JB6 cells were transiently cotransfected with 200 ng of luciferase
reporter and 20 ng pcDNA-TAM67 (or vector control) per well (as
indicated in the figure legends). Subconfluent primary keratinocytes
were transfected with a total of 200 ng of luciferase reporter DNA per well

Dominant-Negative AP-1 (TAM67) Targets Cox-2 and OPN

Figure 2. TAM67 inhibits tumor promotion without
targeting cell proliferation or cell survival. Green, those
genes and functions down-regulated by TAM67; yellow,
those genes and functions unchanged by TAM67
expression (tumor-promoted TAM67 transgenic/tumorpromoted nontransgenic = 1.0 F 0.1). All genes depicted

were confirmed as TAM67 targets by quantitative PCR.

shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. All experimental values presented
represent an average of three independent RNA samples. The lack
of TAM67 effects on HPV16-E7- or TPA-induced hyperproliferation
or cell survival (7, 9), coupled with the requirement for opposite
regulation by tumor promoter and inhibitor TAM67, provides a
powerful tool to enrich for genes functionally significant in tumor
promotion.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) inhibits TPA-induced
gene expression. In DMBA/TPA-treated epidermis, of the 10,440
informative genes (i.e., expressed at a level 2 SD above background
in at least 50% of the experiments), 3,970 genes changed expression
level more than 1.5-fold in response to a single 6-h dose of TPA.
Of these 3,970 genes, 904 were oppositely regulated by TPA
treatment and TAM67 expression (Fig. 1A). Of the 904 TPAregulated genes, 461 genes were induced by TPA treatment and
inhibited by TAM67 expression (Fig. 1B). Because AP-1 most often
activates, rather than inhibits transcription, these 461 genes are
likely to be enriched for direct targets of TAM67. Of the 16 TPAinduced genes inhibited more than 4-fold by TAM67, induction of
9 was completely blocked (Supplementary Table S1A). Seven of the
nine showed significant inhibition by a pooled t test. Among these
nine completely blocked genes were arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase–
activating protein (Alox5ap), urokinase plasminogen activator
(Plaur) and osteopontin (Spp1/Opn), already shown to be involved
in driving tumor promotion and progression (29–32). Despite the
P value of 0.062, the inhibition of TPA-induced Opn mRNA
expression by TAM67 was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Table 1),
showing about 15-fold inhibition. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2, epidermal osteopontin protein levels did not change at
6 h in response to TPA or to TAM67, possibly reflecting a need to
measure osteopontin in basement membrane or other ECM where
it functions. A cutoff of 2-fold instead of 4-fold with complete block
identified a total of 65 genes. Expression profiling thus identified
a limited set of TPA-induced genes in which induction was

www.aacrjournals.org

completely blocked by TAM67 expression under conditions
previously shown to specifically inhibit tumor promotion.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) inhibits E7-enhanced
gene expression. Epithelial expression of HPV16-E7 induces
epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and spontaneous skin
tumors (24). HPV16-E7 synergizes with chemical tumor promoters
during the promotion stage of carcinogenesis to produce
papillomas. Expression of TAM67 protects mice from E7-enhanced
tumor promotion (9). Of the 940 genes oppositely regulated by E7
and TAM67, 549 genes were down-regulated by TAM67 (Fig. 1B).
Supplementary Table S1B shows that of the 18 E7-induced genes
inhibited more than 4-fold by TAM67, induction of 9 was
completely blocked. Five of these nine genes showed significant
inhibition by a pooled t test. Expression of the oncogene growthrelated gene 1 (Gro1/Cxcl1) was inhibited more than 7-fold by
TAM67 (Supplementary Table S1B). Cxcl1 positively regulates
angiogenesis, a process in which tumors depend for survival,
growth, invasion, and metastasis (33). When the cutoff was 2-fold
instead of 4-fold, the number of genes completely blocked was 43.
Thus, dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) down-regulates and
completely blocks induction by E7 of a limited set of genes
potentially important for HPV16-E7–enhanced carcinogenesis.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) inhibits E7-enhanced
TPA-induced gene expression. E7 expression greatly enhances
TPA-induced papilloma formation. As previously shown, TAM67
expression blocks both TPA-induced and E7-enhanced tumor
promotion (7, 9). Although TAM67 expression inhibits E7/TPAinduced papilloma formation by as much as 5-fold, the magnitude
of TAM67-induced change in gene expression seen in the
combined E7/TPA background is considerably muted compared
with the TAM67 effects with E7 or TPA alone. Instead of the more
than 4-fold inhibition by TAM67 seen in the E7 or TPA
background, maximal inhibition in the combined E7/TPA
background was just over 2-fold. This muting of TAM67-induced

change may be explained, in part, by an increased number and
magnitude of expression of induced genes seen with the
combination of tumor promoters. Treatment with TPA induced
45 of the 9,708 informative genes (0.46%) >10-fold. E7 expression
up-regulated 15 of the 9,011 informative genes (0.17%) >10-fold.
The combination of TPA and E7 induced 61 of the 9,762
informative genes (0.62%) more than 10-fold. Of the 625 genes
oppositely regulated by TAM67 and the combination of E7 and
TPA, 242 genes were down-regulated by TAM67 expression. Three
of these were completely blocked for induction. One of these,
Tradd, was significantly inhibited. Tradd, a death domain–
containing adaptor molecule that interacts with tumor necrosis
factor receptor superfamily, member 1a (Tnfrsf1a/TNFR1)
mediates programmed cell death signaling and NFnB activation (Supplementary Table S1C). Thus, TAM67 eliminated the
combined tumor promoter induction of gene expression for a
limited set of genes.
Reported AP-1/c-Jun target genes are oppositely regulated
by tumor promoter and dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67).
A review of the literature reveals 17 published AP-1/c-Jun target
genes to be oppositely regulated by at least one tumor promotion
regimen and TAM67 in vivo (Supplementary Table S2; refs. 34–38).

Among the known c-Jun targets are two tumor suppressors,
caveolin 1 (Cav1) and sprouty homologue 1 (Spry1), which are upregulated in response to TAM67 expression. Both Cav1 and Spry1
are reported to inhibit Ras/Map kinase signaling (39, 40).
Mediators of invasion and metastasis that are known targets of
AP-1, including MMP-10, Plaur/uPAR, CD44, and Spp1/Opn, are
down-regulated by TAM67 expression in mouse skin. Transcription of cell proliferation (e.g., cyclin D3/Ccnd3 and Rb1) and cell
survival genes (e.g., Bcl2l2/Bcl-w and RelA/p65), however, does not
seem to be targeted by TAM67 because these genes showed
expression ratios for tumor promoter plus TAM67; tumor
promoter minus TAM67 that were 1.0 F 0.1 (Fig. 2). As predicted
by the phenotype of the mice, TAM67 expression specifically
inhibits tumorigenesis and tumor progression without targeting
transcription of genes that mediate cell proliferation or cell
survival.
Tumor promoter–induced Cox-2 expression is inhibited by
dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67). To be relevant to the range
and combinations of exposures that cause human cancer, we were
interested in TAM67 down-regulated genes that were common to all
three epidermal tumor promotion protocols (TPA alone, E7 alone, or
the combination of TPA and E7). Genes belonging to this triple

Dominant-Negative AP-1 (TAM67) Targets Cox-2 and OPN

Figure 4. CRE/Ebox is required for suppression of Cox-2 promoter activation by dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) in wild-type primary keratinocytes. The relative
luciferase activity of mouse Cox-2 promoter reporter deletion and point mutant constructs was measured in the presence of TPA and the presence or absence of
transgenic TAM67. Wild-type (A and C ) and E7 transgenic (B and D ) primary keratinocytes were cultured, and luciferase activity was measured after 22 h of TPA
treatment. , point mutations. Columns, averages of six wells and representative of three experiments. *, P < 0.05. The 100% value is assigned to the TPA-induced
activity of each construct in the absence of TAM67. This 100% value represents a different average relative luciferase unit (RLU) value for each construct
(see Fig. 3).

overlap group may have a more global role in tumor promotion.
Cox-2, a major enzyme-mediating inflammatory responses and well
recognized as a molecular target for chemoprevention, was one of
only six genes down-regulated by TAM67 expression under all three
tumor-promoting conditions tested (Supplementary Table S1D).
Despite the lack of a P value in the significant range, quantitative
PCR analysis confirmed the inhibition of Cox-2 transcription by
TAM67 (Table 1), showing more than 4-fold inhibition of TPAinduced expression. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, Cox-2
protein levels were not significantly changed at 6 h in response to
TPA or to TAM67. Whether transient changes in Cox-2 protein
occurred before 6 h or delayed changes occurred subsequent to 6 h is
presently unknown. This is the first report of in vivo down-regulation
of Cox-2 mRNA expression levels by TAM67 under conditions in
which TAM67 is known to specifically inhibit tumor promotion.
CRE/Ebox, CAAT/enhancer binding protein, and AP-1–
like sites but not NFKB sites are required for Cox-2
promoter activation. To determine the regions of the mouse
Cox-2 promoter required for basal and TPA-induced activity in
primary keratinocytes, we examined the response of a series of
Cox-2 promoter reporter constructs transiently transfected into
wild-type and HPV16-E7 transgenic primary keratinocytes to

TPA or solvent control. As shown in Fig. 3A, the promoter
region upstream of 203, containing the highly conserved NFnB
site at position 404, is not required for full TPA-induced
activity of the Cox-2 promoter in either wild-type or HPV16-E7–
expressing keratinocytes. As reported previously for other model
systems (26, 41), the conserved CRE/Ebox and CAAT/enhancer
binding protein (C/EBP) sites at positions 59 and 139,
respectively, are necessary for both basal and TPA-induced
activation of the Cox-2 promoter reporter in primary wildtype and E7 transgenic keratinocytes (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, the
AP-1–like site at position 69 is also required for basal and
TPA-induced Cox-2 promoter reporter activation in primary
keratinocytes (Fig. 3C). The AP-1–like site at position 69 was
also required for Cox-2 promoter activation in transformationsensitive (P+) JB6 cells (Fig. 3C). To our knowledge, this is the
first report of the requirement of this AP-1–like site for Cox-2
promoter activation.
CRE/Ebox is required for suppression of Cox-2 promoter
activation by dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67). We next
addressed the question of which transcription factor binding sites
are required for suppression of induced Cox-2 promoter
activation by dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67). To identify the

sites through which TAM67 acts to inhibit tumor promoter–
induced Cox-2 expression in the mouse skin, we did Cox-2
promoter reporter assays in the presence of tumor promoter and
TAM67 in primary keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 4C and D, the
highly conserved NFnB site ( 404) and AP-1–like sites ( 69 and
+34) are not necessary for TAM67 inhibition of TPA-induced
activation of the mouse Cox-2 promoter. Although the CRE/Ebox
( 59) is required for the TAM67 inhibition of the TPA-induced
Cox-2 promoter activation in wild-type primary keratinocytes
(Fig. 4A), this site does not seem to be required in HPV16-E7
transgenic keratinocytes (Fig. 4B). Thus, TAM67 acts through the
CRE/Ebox ( 59) to inhibit Cox-2 promoter activation by TPA in
wild-type keratinocytes. The sites responsible for TAM67 inhibition of Cox-2 in E7 transgenic keratinocytes were not discernible,
possibly owing to low sensitivity associated with the relatively
small magnitude of inhibition of transcription from this promoter
by TAM67 in the E7 background.
AP-1 site is required for Opn promoter activation by TPA
and for suppression of Opn promoter activation by dominantnegative c-Jun (TAM67). To determine the regions of the mouse
Opn promoter required for basal and TPA-induced activity in
transformation-sensitive JB6 cells, we examined the response of a
series of Opn promoter reporter constructs transiently transfected
into transformation-sensitive JB6 cells to TPA or solvent control. As
shown in Fig. 5A, the promoter region upstream of 50, containing
the conserved AP-1 site at position 76, is required for full TPAinduced activity of the Opn promoter.
We next addressed the question of whether an AP-1 transcription factor binding site is required for suppression of Opn promoter

activation by dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67). To identify the
sites through which TAM67 acts to inhibit tumor promoter–
induced Opn expression, we did Opn promoter reporter assays in
the presence of tumor promoter and TAM67 in the transformationsensitive JB6 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, the deletion of the
promoter region upstream of 50 shifts the inhibition by TAM67
from 50% to 30% (P = 0.02), suggesting that the 76 AP-1 site is
required for the suppression by TAM67 of TPA-induced activity of
the Opn promoter.
In summary, induction by TPA of the prometastatic protransformation gene Opn is completely blocked by TAM67 in mouse
epidermis. Cox-2, a proinflammatory gene, is down-regulated by
TAM67 expression in the presence of TPA, E7, or both. Quantitative
PCR confirmed the microarray results for both. Both genes are
transcriptional targets of TAM67.

Discussion
This analysis has identified TAM67 target genes that seem to
be functionally significant in the mechanism by which the TAM67
inhibitor selectively inhibits tumor promotion and tumor
progression. Spp1/Opn, Plaur, MMP-10, and Alox5AP seem to be
important during TPA-induced tumor promotion, whereas Cxcl1/
Gro1 may be important during E7-enhanced tumor promotion.
Cox-2 has emerged as a transcriptional target of TAM67 that is
regulated through the CRE site. In addition, a previously
uncharacterized AP-1–like site ( 69) has been implicated in
basal and TPA-induced Cox-2 expression. OPN is a transcriptional
target of TAM67 that is regulated in part through an AP-1 site.
The implicated TAM67 target genes seem to be regulators of

promoter activation by dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67)
in transformation-sensitive JB6 cells. JB6 cells were
cultured in EMEM containing 4% FBS and treated with
TPA (10 ng/mL) or DMSO in EMEM containing 0.2% FBS
for 22 h. The relative luciferase activity of a series of
mouse Opn promoter reporter deletion constructs was
measured in the presence or absence of TPA.
A, sequences upstream of 88 are required for full TPAinduced promoter reporter activity. Sequences between
88 and 50, including an AP-1 site at position 76, are
also required for basal and TPA-induced activity (A).
B, sequences between 88 and 50, including an AP-1
site at position 76, are also required for suppression of
Opn promoter activation by dominant-negative c-Jun
(TAM67) in transformation-sensitive JB6 cells. The 100%
value is assigned to the TPA-induced activity of each
construct in the absence of TAM67. This 100% value
represents a different average RLU value for each
construct (see A). Columns, averages of six wells and
representative of three experiments. Statistical
significance was determined using a two-tailed paired

inflammation, invasion, and metastasis rather than regulators of
cell proliferation or cell survival, an observation predicted by the
phenotypes of the TAM67 mice.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) targets invasion/metastasis-associated but not tumor promotion-specific genes
during tumor promotion. Interestingly, many of the TAM67
targets implicated after a single 6-h dose of the tumor promoter
TPA are genes known to be involved in invasion and metastasis
(Fig. 2). Plaur/uPAR, inhibited more than 4-fold by TAM67, is a
major driver of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Many of these
genes had not previously been established as important for earlier
stages of carcinogenesis. This is a significant observation because
these genes now emerge as promising treatment targets during
early-, middle-, and late-stage carcinogenesis. Genes important for
maintaining tumor phenotype and stimulating aggressive cancer
development now emerge as important in tumor promotion and
early tumorigenesis. What did not emerge were genes unique to
tumor promotion. Examining gene expression at later times
during tumor promotion following single or multiple doses of
TPA may reveal target genes unique to tumor induction. Because
the rate-limiting steps in tumorigenesis occur during tumor
promotion and progression, the functionally significant TAM67
targets implicated in tumorigenesis are important targets for
cancer prevention. These observations raise the possibility that all
of the epigenetic makings of cancer are present early in
carcinogenesis during tumor promotion.
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) targets proinflammatory
genes. Targeting proinflammatory genes seems to be important
in the mechanism by which the AP-1/NFnB inhibitor TAM67
specifically inhibits tumorigenesis. TAM67–down-regulated genes
Plaur/uPAR, Alox5AP, Spp1/Opn, and Ptgs2/Cox-2 are important
in urokinase plasminogen activator (PLAU) signaling, leukotriene,
and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Alox5ap, critical for the cellular
synthesis of proinflammatory leukotrienes, is also one of the
genes most inhibited by TAM67. Spp1/Opn, an extracellular
matrix molecule overexpressed in many pathologic processes
ranging from inflammation to metastasis, was also among the
genes in which expression was most inhibited by TAM67.
Moreover, Cox-2, although less inhibited, is a well-established
mediator of inflammation. It is also interesting to note that
markers of inflammatory cell infiltration and angiogenesis,
including Cxcl1/Gro1, were down-regulated in tumor promoter–
treated TAM67 transgenic mice. Cxcl1 also functions downstream
of Cox-2 (42). TAM67 expression seems to short-circuit signaling
to the inflammatory response. The inflammatory response is
important not only for invasion and metastasis, but also for

angiogenesis, a process that is needed for tumorigenesis as well
as for tumor progression (43–45).
Dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) does not target genes that
regulate cell proliferation and survival. As predicted by the
selective effects of TAM67 in the mouse model, the transcription of
cell proliferation genes (cyclin D3/Ccnd3, Rb1) and cell survival
genes (Bcl2l2/Bcl-w, Rela/p65) is not inhibited by TAM67 (Fig. 2). It is
important to note that the specificity of TAM67 targeting is dose
dependent. Low-dose TAM67 expression, as is seen in the TAM67
transgenic mice, specifically inhibits induction of transcription from
4 AP-1 and NFnB promoter reporters without inhibiting induced
transcription from a cell proliferation–associated SRE promoter
reporter or cFos (ref. 46 and Supplementary Fig. S3).
Cox-2 and Opn are transcriptional targets of TAM67.
Designation of AP-1 target genes is commonly based on overexpression of AP-1–dependent genes such as c-Jun or inspection of
promoters to identify recognizable AP-1 sites. Demonstration of
transcriptional targeting is often not pursued. TAM67-inhibited
RNA expression does not establish a gene as a transcriptional
target, but rather calls for analysis of the response to TAM67
of transcription from the gene promoter. Here, the transfection
analysis of the Cox-2 and Opn promoters was conducted in cells
that also showed TAM67 inhibition of endogenous gene expression.
The Cox-2 promoter analysis implicates the CRE, but not NFnB, site
as a target of TAM67. The Opn promoter analysis implicates an
AP-1 site as a target of TAM67. The lack of observed regulation of
TAM67 target genes through NFnB sites is consistent with the
apparent lack of NFnB requirement for driving skin carcinogenesis
(13). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis will be
important for further characterization of the regulation by
TAM67 of the endogenous Cox-2 and Opn promoters, as well as
other endogenous target gene promoters. However, ChIP is
restricted by the lack of effective antibodies and the low level of
TAM67 expression needed to inhibit transcription. In summary,
dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67) targets genes important in
inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, but not cell proliferation or
survival when it specifically prevents tumor promotion.
