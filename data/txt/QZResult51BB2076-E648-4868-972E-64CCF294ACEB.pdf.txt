ABSTRACT
Strategies to target nanoparticles to tumors that rely on surface modification
with ligands that bind molecules overexpressed on cancer cells or the tumor
neovasculature suffer from a major limitation: with delivery of toxic agents the
amount of molecules available for targeting decreases with time; consequently, the
efficiency of nanoparticle delivery is reduced. To overcome this limitation, here we
propose an autocatalytic tumor-targeting mechanism based on targeting extracellular
DNA (exDNA). exDNA is enriched in the tumor microenviroment and increases with
treatment with cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin (DOX), due to release of DNA by
dying tumor cells. We tested this approach using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
nanoparticles surface-conjugated with fragments of 3E10 (3E10EN), a lupus anti-DNA
autoantibody. We demonstrated that 3E10EN-conjugated nanoparticles bound to DNA
and preferentially localized to tumors in vivo. The efficiency of tumor localization of
3E10EN-conjugated, DOX-loaded nanoparticles increased with time and subsequent
treatments, demonstrating an autocatalytic effect. 3E10EN-conjugated DOX-loaded
nanoparticles exhibited a significant anti-tumor effect that was superior to all controls.
This work demonstrates the promise of autocatalytic drug delivery mechanisms and
establishes proof of concept for a new anti-DNA autoantibody-based approach for
enhancing delivery of nanoparticles to tumors.

lymphatic drainage in tumors [2], the use of nanocarriers
alters the bio-distribution of the encapsulated drugs and
results in preferential accumulation in tumors. However,
this passive targeting approach based on the EPR effect
may not be sufficient to yield meaningful gains in cancer
therapy [3]. To further enhance targeting efficiency,
nanocarriers have been engineered through conjugation
to ligands that have high affinities for molecules
overexpressed in cancer cells or the tumor neovasculature
or tumor microenvironment. [4–8]. Nonetheless, these
traditional targeting approaches suffer from a significant
limitation: with the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents
which kill the tumor cells and neovasculature, the amount

INTRODUCTION
The first nanodrug, Doxil®, which is a formulation
of doxorubicin (DOX) in liposomal nanocarriers, was
approved by the FDA for treatment of human patients
with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma in 1995 [1]. Since
then, development of nanocarriers for delivery of
chemotherapeutic drugs has emergered as a promising
approach to cancer therapy with many advantages
compared to free drugs. Due to the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect resulting from the size
difference between interendothelial junctions in tumors
(40-80 nm) and healthy tissue (<8 nm) and defective

of molecules avaliable for targeted delivery decreases
with time; consequently, the efficiency of nanoparticle
accumulation in tumors is reduced.
A key
feature
that
distinguishes
the
microenvironment within tumors from that of healthy
tissue is the presence of a comparatively larger amount
of extracellular DNA (exDNA) [9–12], which originates
from actively dividing, apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells
and neutrophil extracellular traps [12–14]. Importantly,
the amount of exDNA in the region of tumors further
increases during treatment with cytotoxic agents, such
as DOX, that cause tumor cell death and release of DNA
[15, 16]. The greater concentration of exDNA in the
tumor environment compared to normal tissues offers an
opportunity to develop a novel tumor targeting approach
using an agent that has a high affinity with DNA. We
believe that an anti-DNA autoantibody associated with the
autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
is well suited to this task.
Circulating autoantibodies that bind DNA are
commonly found in patients with SLE. The role of these
anti-DNA autoantibodies in SLE pathophysiology is
unclear, but we have recently recognized the potential
to harness them for use in cancer therapy [16–19]. Most
important for the present work is the finding that a specific
nuclear-penetrating lupus anti-DNA autoantibody, 3E10,
has great potential to be used as a tumor-targeting agent
for nanocarriers. 3E10 penetrates cell nuclei and inhibits
DNA repair in a manner that is not toxic to normal cells
but can kill cancer cells with defects in DNA repair [16].
The ability of 3E10 to penetrate nuclei is dependent on
the presence of exDNA, and when administered to mice
and rats 3E10 is preferentially attracted to tissues in which
exDNA is enriched, including tumors, regions of ischemic
brain in stroke models, and skeletal muscle subject to
contractile injury [9, 20–22].
Based on the capacity of 3E10 to home to sites of
exDNA, we proposed to use this antibody to develop an
autocatalytic, tumor-targeting mechanism for systemic
delivery of nanoparticles to tumors by targeting exDNA
with surface-conjugated fragments of 3E10. Because
the concentration of exDNA in tumor environments
is expected to increase with time and delivery of
cytotoxic therapy, by using this strategy it is expected
that the efficiency of nanoparticle accumulation in
tumors will autocatalytically increase with time and
subsequent treatments (Figure 1). To test this approach,
in the present study we generated poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with 3E10 fragments
conjugated to the surface for exDNA targeting and with
encapsulated DOX as a model chemotherapy drug.
We show that the resulting nanoparticles associate
with exDNA, preferentially localize to tumors in an
autocatalytic manner, and yield significant suppression
of tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse breast cancer
model.

Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles
with and without surface anti-DNA autoantibody
In order to avoid potential nonspecific toxicity
secondary to Fc-mediated activation of complement or
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, 3E10
fragments lacking an Fc region have recently been
generated and tested. One of the most promising variants
of these fragments is an enhanced di-single chain variable
fragment of 3E10 that has been mutated to improve
its binding affinity for DNA [17]. We therefore chose
this fragment, 3E10 (D31N) di-scFv, for testing in the
present study and it is hereafter referred to as 3E10EN
(EN=enhanced).
To test the ability of 3E10EN to autocatalytically
deliver nanoparticles to tumors we synthesized DOXloaded PLGA nanoparticles with surface-conjugated
3E10EN (3E10EN/DOX-NPs) as shown in the schematic in
Figure 1A. PLGA was first conjugated with poly(L-lysine)
(PLL) and the resulting PLGA-PLL, which contains
lysine groups for surface functionalization, was used as
the starting material. To enable efficient encapsulation, the
hydrochloride group in commercial DOX hydrochloride
was removed through titration using triethylamine in
dichloromethane. Nanoparticles were synthesized through
the standard single emulsion procedure and further
modified with NHS-PEG-Mal to display maleimide
groups for conjugation of thiolated 3E10EN. Controls
included nanoparticles without surface conjugated 3E10EN
(DOX-NPs), nanoparticles with 3E10EN but without
DOX (3E10EN-NPs), and nanoparticles without 3E10EN
or DOX (naked NPs) and were synthesized using the
same procedures but without 3E10EN conjugation, DOX
encapsulation, or both. Schematic diagrams of PLGA-PLL
synthesis and NP fabrication are shown in Supplementary
Figure S1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed
that all nanoparticles were spherical and of size 86-107
nm (Figure 2A, 2F). The hydrodynamic diameters of
the nanoparticles of different formulations were in the
range of 180-210 nm (Figure 2B, 2C). The conjugation
of 3E10EN slightly increased nanoparticle size. An average
of 5 3E10EN molecules were conjugated to the surface of
each nanoparticle. DOX was encapsulated with 6.0% by
weight (Figure 2F). Zeta potentials of the different NPs
were also measured. PLGA NPs with PLL were found
to have a neutral surface charge, whereas conjugation of
3E10EN decreased the surface charge to -8 mV (Figure 2F).
We compared the release of DOX from 3E10EN/
DOX-NPs and DOX-NPs to determine if 3E10EN
interfered in any way with drug release. As shown in
Figure 2D, DOX was released in an equivalent controlled
manner over 12 days from both 3E10EN/DOX-NPs and
DOX-NPs, indicating that 3E10EN did not interfere
with drug release. Next, the nanoparticles were tested

cells. The cells were treated for three days with DOX
alone, DOX-NPs, 3E10EN-NPs, or 3E10EN/DOX-NPs and
then survival was evaluated by MTT assay. Free DOX,
DOX-NPs, and 3E10EN/DOX-NPs all yielded comparable
inhibition of cells, while the 3E10EN-NPs without DOX
were not significantly toxic to the cells (Figure 2E).
The characteristics of the nanoparticles used in this
study are summarized in Figure 2F. These results are of
particular interest because, although the amount of DOX
released from the NPs during the treatment period was
approximately 40% of the amount of drug to which cells
were exposed in the group that received treatment with
free DOX, the DOX-NPs and free DOX had a similar
effect on cell viability. This may seem surprising at first,
but similar findings have been extensively documented
in the literature [23–27] and this effect is likely due to
differences between the mechanisms governing cellular
uptake and export of nanoparticles and free drugs. For
example, free DOX, but not DOX-loaded nanoparticles,
is a substrate of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
highly expressed in tumor cells.

that surface-conjugated 3E10EN would enhance the
interaction of nanoparticles with DNA. To test this we
coated a glass slide with linearized plasmid DNA and
incubated it with nanoparticles with and without surface
3E10EN. For the purpose of detection, the nanoparticles
were encapsulated with IR780, a near-infrared fluorescent
dye. After a 60-minute incubation with the nanoparticles
the slide was rinsed and the signal of IR780, which
correlated with the amount of nanoparticles, was
visualized by IVIS. Representative images are shown
in Figure 3A, and signal was quantified in Figure 3B.
Conjugation of 3E10EN increased the association of
nanoparticles with the DNA-coated glass surface by 5.6
fold, confirming that 3E10EN-NPs are attracted to DNA as
expected.

exDNA is enriched in 4T1 tumors and increases
with 3E10EN/DOX-NP treatment
We next set out to test the ability of 3E10EN to
target nanoparticles to tumors using the syngeneic 4T1
murine breast cancer mouse model. In this model 4T1
breast cancer xenografts were generated by subcutaneous
injection in BALB/c mice. Prior to initiating efficacy
studies we first evaluated the relative amounts of exDNA
in normal tissues and 4T1 tumors with and without
treatment with 3E10EN/DOX-NPs by Picogreen staining.
Consistent with previous findings [9–12], the amount of

3E10EN-conjugation enhances the interaction of
nanoparticles with exDNA
We previously demonstrated that 3E10 has a high
affinity with DNA [9, 16], and we therefore hypothesized

autocatalytic, tumor-targeted delivery of nanoparticles. 3E10EN has the ability to home nanoparticles to tumors, which contain a greater
amount of exDNA than healthy tissue (B). The concentration of exDNA in tumor environments is expected to further increase with time and
delivery of cytotoxic therapy, such as DOX. Therefore, the efficiency of nanoparticle accumulation in tumors autocatalytically increases
with time and subsequent treatments (C).

mice with 3E10EN/DOX-NPs increased the amount of
exDNA in tumors by 5.1 fold compared to tumors in
untreated mice. Taken together, our results confirmed that
this mouse model was appropriate for testing the proposed
autocatalytic delivery of nanoparticles to tumors using
3E10EN to target exDNA.

IR780-loaded nanoparticles with or without 3E10EN
conjugation were administered intravenously to 4T1
tumor-bearing mice. Twenty-four hours later, tumors were
excised and imaged using an IVIS imaging system. Naked
NPs were observed to localize into a range of tissues, with
some tumor uptake but the greatest amount of uptake was
seen in the liver. By contrast, 3E10EN-conjugated NPs
showed a pattern of preferential uptake into tumors rather
than liver and a 2.3-fold increase in tumor localization
compared to naked NPs (Figure 5A). 3E10EN did not alter
the circulation life of NPs (Supplementary Figure S2), and
therefore the enhanced uptake mediated by 3E10EN is most

mediate preferential delivery of nanoparticles to tumors.

likely due to interaction with exDNA in tumors. These
results suggest preferential targeting of nanoparticles to
untreated tumors by 3E10EN.
According to our proposed strategy, the
efficiency of 3E10EN-mediated delivery should increase
autocatalytically with time and delivery of treatments

that induce release of tumor DNA and cause further
accumulation of exDNA in the tumor environment
(Figure 1). To test this hypothesis, we treated 4T1 tumorbearing mice with 3E10EN/DOX-NPs without IR780

priming treatments). On the third day, mice received a

hours later, tumors were excised and imaged. As shown
in Figure 5A, the priming treatments with 3E10EN/DOXNPs significantly enhanced the tumor delivery of the
nanoparticles. The average amount of nanoparticles in
tumors from mice that received priming treatments was
1.8 times greater than the amount in tumors from mice
without priming. Notably, with priming, the accumulation

19%, respectively. No significant difference was found
between these two groups. By contrast, treatment with
3E10EN/DOX-NPs reduced tumor volume by 72%.
Histologically, tumors from control treatments revealed
a highly cellular mass with prominent nuclei; in contrast,
tumors from animals treated with 3E10EN/DOX-NPs
exhibited a much lower cellular mass, a lower nuclearcytoplasmic ratio (Figure 6B), and a marked increase
in the number of apoptotic cells measured by TUNEL
staining (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION

3E10EN/DOX-NPs have a significantly greater
effect on tumors than DOX-NPs or DOX alone

In this study we proposed a novel autocatalytic
tumor-targeting mechanism for systemic delivery of
nanoparticles to tumors that takes advantage of exDNA
in the tumor environment. We tested this approach using
3E10EN as the targeting ligand for exDNA and DOX as the
model drug, and have now shown that 3E10EN mediates
efficient delivery of nanoparticles to tumors and that
this efficiency increases with subsequent treatments as
more exDNA is released by the dying tumors. Compared
to other targeting approaches that suffer from reduced
efficiency over time as the relevant targets regress with
treatment, the present technique has the key advantage
of improved efficiency with time and treatment due to
increased release of exDNA into the target environment.
Therefore, the proposed mechanism may represent a novel
direction for the development of nanocarriers for targeted
drug delivery.

Lastly, we assessed whether the 3E10EN-based
approach to targeting exDNA for autocatalytic tumortargeted drug delivery would result in improvements
in tumor response to treatment in vivo. Mice bearing
4T1 tumors of ~100 mm3 size were treated three times
a week with intravenous injection of control PBS, free
DOX, DOX-NPs, 3E10EN-NPs, or 3E10EN/DOX-NPs.
Tumor volumes were measured three times a week, and
the resulting growth curves are shown in Figure 6A. Of
all of the treatment groups, only the 3E10EN/DOX-NPs
were observed to greatly inhibit tumor growth (p<0.01
compared to both free DOX and DOX-NPs). By the
end of the study, compared to the control group that
received PBS treatment, treatments with free DOX or
DOX-NPs reduced tumor volumes by only 26% and

The present work also reveals a new application
for the 3E10 antibody in molecular therapy. 3E10 has
the unusual ability to penetrate into the nuclei of living
cells, and the antibody has previously been used to
deliver therapeutic cargo proteins in vitro and in vivo [28,
29]. More recently, the ability of 3E10 to inhibit DNA
repair has been recognized as having potential for use
against DNA repair-deficient tumors [16, 17, 19]. Our
present work took advantage of the capacity of 3E10 to
home to sites of exDNA in vivo by using it to guide the
nanoparticles to tumor sites in an autocatalytic manner.
This work establishes proof of concept for an anti-DNA
autoantibody-based approach to targeting cargo molecules
including nanoparticles to sites of exDNA, which is
relevant to the treatment of cancer as well as ischemic or
traumatic conditions such as stroke, infarction, or injury
wherein DNA is released at the site of damage.
In conclusion, nanomedicine has the potential to
make major contributions to clinical cancer care. In the
meanwhile, select lupus anti-DNA autoantibodies have
emerged as possible new agents for use in cancer therapy
due in part to their affinity for DNA. Based on our present
work, we believe strategies to combine DNA-targeting
antibodies with nanocarriers will help facilitate translation
of both technologies into clinically relevant therapies.

acetic acid and allowed to stir for 90 min for deprotection.
The polymer was precipitated in ether and washed until
the product changed from a yellow to an off-white
appearance. The product was then dissolved in chloroform
and precipitated in ether. The polymer was vacuum dried
for 24 h to remove all traces of ether. Samples before and
after deprotection were collected to confirm modification
of the polymer and subsequent removal of protecting
carbobenzoxyl groups. The samples were dissolved in
trifluoroethanol and evaluated from 200 to 350 nm using
spectroscopy (Cary 50 Bio UV-Vis Spectrophotometer,
Varian, Palo Alto, CA).

3E10EN production and thiolation

MATERIALS AND METHODS

3E10 (D31N) di-scFv (referred to as 3E10EN in
this study) was produced in and purified from P. pastoris
as previously described [17]. Purity and identity of
the 3E10EN isolated from P. pastoris supernatant was
confirmed by SDS-PAGE and anti-Myc Western blot prior
to conjugation to nanoparticles.
Thiolation of 3E10EN antibody was performed using
Traut’s agent. Briefly, 54 uL 3E10 solution (5 mg/ml) and
18 uL Traut’s agent solution (10 mg/ml) were added to 1
ml PBS (pH 8.0 with 5 mM EDTA). The thiolation process
took 1 hour by rotating the mixed solution on a horizontal
shaker at room temperature.

Materials and cell culture

Nanoparticles synthesis

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless otherwise noted. The mouse mammary tumor
cell line 4T1 was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and cultured in DMEM medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml
streptomycin (Invitrogen), in a 37°C incubator containing
5% CO2.

To produce DOX for nanoparticle synthesis, the
hydrochloride groups in commercial DOX hydrochloride
(Sigma) were removed through titration using
triethylamine in dichloromethane, resulting in DOX
soluble in organic solvents. DOX-loaded nanoparticles
were synthesized according to the standard single emulsion
procedure. For synthesis of DOX-NPs, 50 mg PLGA-PLL
and 6.7 mg doxorubicin were dissolved in 2 mL ethyl
acetate. The solution was then added dropwise to a solution
of 2 ml 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The resulting
emulsion was sonicated on ice 3 times for 10 seconds each.
The emulsion was then poured into a beaker containing
aqueous 0.3% (v/v) PVA and stirred at room temperature
overnight to allow the EA to evaporate and the particles
to harden. Particles were collected by centrifugation
at 18000 rpm for 30 minutes, washed twice with water,
frozen, and lyophilized. For synthesis of 3E10EN/DOXNPs, the same emulsion procedures were used. After
overnight evaporation, nanoparticles were collected and
re-suspended in PBS containing NHS-PEG5000-Mal
(8mg, JenKem Technology). After a 30 minute reaction,
extra NHS-PEG5000-Mal was removed by centrifuge
(18000 rpm, 30 min). PEGylated nanoparticles were
then re-suspended in PBS containing thiolated 3E10 (270
ug). Sixty minutes later, nanoparticles were collected by
centrifugation at 18000 rpm, 30 min, washed twice with

Synthesis of PLGA-PLL
PLGA-PLL was synthesized according to
procedures that we previously reported [6, 30]. Briefly,
PLGA (3 g, 50:50 PLGA Acid End Group; i.v. ~0.67
dL/g; Absorbable Polymers, AL) and 200 mg poly(εcarbobenzoxyl-L-lysine) (PLL) (MW 1000-4000 Da,
Sigma) were dissolved in 6 mL dimethlyformamide in
a dry round-bottom flask under argon. Dicyclohexyl
carbodiimide (58 mg) and 0.31 mg dimethylaminopyridine
in 2 mL dimethlyformamide was added to the polymer
solution and allowed to stir for 48 h. The reacted solution
was diluted by the addition of chloroform and precipitated
in methanol. The dried polymer was then re-dissolved in
chloroform, precipitated in ether, and dried under vacuum
for 24 h. To remove protection, dried protected product
was dissolved in 10 mL hydrogen bromide, 30% wt in

but without DOX/3E10EN and DOX, respectively.

room temperature. Release of DOX was monitored at
several time intervals over 14 days. At each sampling
time, the nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged for
10 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed for
quantification of DOX and an equal volume of PBS was
replaced for continued monitoring of release. Detection of
DOX was performed using the same methods as described
above.

Characterization of nanoparticle size,
morphology and Zeta potential
The morphology and size of nanoparticles was
characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Briefly, dry nanoparticles were mounted on carbon tape
and sputter-coated with gold in an argon atmosphere
using a sputter current of 40 mA (Dynavac Mini Coater,
Dynavac, USA). SEM analysis was carried out with
a Philips XL30 SEM using a LaB electron gun with an
accelerating voltage of 3 kV.
The hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticles
was measured using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).
A transparent cuvette was filled with 0.25 mg mL-1
nanoparticles in HPLC-grade water. The capped cuvette
was placed in a Zetasizer (Malvern) and dynamic light
scattering data was read. Zeta potential was also measured
using the Zetasizer.

Cytotoxicity evaluation
4T1 cells were plated in a 96-well cell culture plate
at a concentration of 2×103 per well and incubated with
concentrations of nanoparticles ranging from 1.25 to 500
ug/mL. The same amounts of free DOX were added to
parallel wells as controls. Three days after treatment, the
effect of treatments on cell proliferation was determined
using the standard MTT assay.

DNA binding by 3E10EN-conjugated
nanoparticles
Plasmid DNA pGL4.74 (20 ug, Promega) was
linearized using BamHI to expose phosphate groups,
which was next activated by N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)N’-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 0.20 mg, 1.0
umol) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 0.17 mg, 1.5
umol) and reacted with NH2-PEG50-NH2 (0.41 mg,
3.0 umol). The resulting DNA with amine groups was
then thiolated with Traut’s Reagent (0.68 mg, 5.0 umol)
and coated to a glass plate surface functionalized with
maleimide groups (MicroSurfaes, Inc). To determine
the binding ability of nanoparticles, IR780-loaded
nanoparticles with and without 3E10EN were re-suspended
in PBS at 1 mg/ml and added to the glass plate surface.
After a 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the glass
plate was rinsed with water. Nanoparticles attached on
the glass plate were detected at 745 nm/ 800 nm (Ex/Em)
using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) system (Xenogen).

Characterization of conjugation efficiency
Ten mg 3E10EN nanoparticles was dissolved in
100 uL DMSO and added to 900 uL ddH2O to make a
final concentration 10 mg/ml. The amount of 3E10EN in
the solution was determined by the standard BCA assay
(Thermo Scientific). Nanoparticles without 3E10EN
processed using the same procedures were used as a
control.

Characterization of drug encapsulation
To determine the drug encapsulation efficiency (EE)
and loading efficiency (LE), 1 mg of DOX-loaded
nanoparticles were dissolved in 100 uL DMSO and added
to 900 uL ddH2O to make a final concentration of 1 mg/
ml. Nanoparticle solution was then spun briefly at 13,000
rpm and 100 uL supernatant was transferred to a
microplate (BioTek). The fluorescence intensity was
measured at 470 nm/590 nm (Ex/Em) and the
concentration of DOX was calculated according to a
standard curve of free DOX. EE and LE was calculated as
follows:

Measurement of exDNA in tumors and healthy
tissues
Tumors were excised from mice with or without
treatment of 3E10EN/DOX-NPs. The livers, hearts and
muscles harvested from healthy mice without tumors were
used as controls. Tumors and control healthy tissues were
sliced in a similar size, mounted to a slide, and stained with
Picogreen (ThermoFisher Scientific). Five minutes later,
the slide was rinsed with water. The fluorescence intensity
was detected at 465 nm/ 520 nm (Ex/Em) by the IVIS.

University Institutional Animal Care and Utilization
Committee (IACUC). To establish tumors, mice received
subcutaneous flank injections of 1×106 4T1 tumor cells.
Tumor size was measured weekly using traceable digital
vernier calipers (Fisher). Tumor volume was determined
by measuring the length (l) and width (w), and then
calculating the volume (V) using the following formula:
V = lw2/2. Tumor homing study was started when the
volume reaches ~200 mm3 (day1). Mice were randomly
divided into 3 groups. The first group was treated with
3E10EN-conjugated nanoparticles without IR780 at day 1
and 2 and received a final injection of 3E10EN-conjugated,
IR780-loaded nanoparticles at day 3. The second and
third groups received intravenous administration of
IR780-loaded nanoparticles and 3E10EN-conjugated,
IR780-loaded nanoparticles at day 3. Nanoparticles were
administered at 1 mg per mouse. The loadings of IR780
in IR780-loaded nanoparticles and 3E10EN-conjugated,
IR780-loaded nanoparticles were comparable. On day
5, mice were euthanized and the tumors were harvested
for imaging using the IVIS. After imaging, tumors were
lyophilized and homogenized in DMSO. The amount
of dye in tumors was extracted and quantified using a
microplate (BioTek).

tumor volume. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate a
statistically significant difference.

Mice bearing 4T1 tumors were established as
described above. In this tumor study treatments began
when tumor volumes reached ~100 mm3. Mice were
randomly divided into five groups, with seven mice per
group, as follows: group 1 received treatment with PBS;
group 2 received treatment with free DOX in PBS; group
3 received treatment with 3E10EN-NPs; group 4 received
treatment with DOX-NPs; and group 5 received treatment
with 3E10EN/DOX-NPs. Treatment was performed 3
times per week. Nanoparticles were administered at 1
mg, equal to 60 ug DOX per mouse. Tumor sizes were
measured three times a week. Mice were euthanized
when tumor volume reached ~1000 mm3, at which
point the tumors were excised and fixed in formalin for
immunohistochemistry. Serial sections were obtained and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Terminal
Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TUNEL) for analysis of
therapeutic effect. The growth curve was plotted using the
mean of the tumor volumes for each treatment group, at
each timepoint.
