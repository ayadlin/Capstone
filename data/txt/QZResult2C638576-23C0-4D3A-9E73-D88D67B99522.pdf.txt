Abstract
Cystatin D/CST5 encodes an inhibitor of cysteine proteases of the cathepsin
family and is directly induced by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Interestingly, vitamin
D3 exerts tumor suppressive effects in a variety of tumor types. In colorectal cancer
(CRC) cells CST5 was shown to mediate mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). We
recently performed an integrated genomic and proteomic screen to identify targets
of the p53 tumor suppressor in CRC cells. Thereby, we identified CST5 as a putative
p53 target gene. Here, we validated and characterized CST5 as a direct p53 target
gene. After activation of a conditional p53 allele, CST5 was upregulated on mRNA
and protein levels. Treatment with nutlin-3a or etoposide induced CST5 in a p53dependent manner. These regulations were direct, since ectopic and endogenous p53
occupied a conserved binding site in the CST5 promoter region. In addition, treatment
with calcitriol, the active vitamin D3 metabolite, and simultaneous activation of p53
resulted in enhanced CST5 induction and increased repression of SNAIL, an epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) inducing transcription factor. Furthermore, CST5
inactivation decreased p53-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) as
evidenced by decreased inhibition of SNAIL and of migration by p53. Furthermore,
CST5 expression was directly repressed by SNAIL. In summary, these results imply
CST5 as an important mediator of tumor suppression by p53 in colorectal cancer. In
addition, they suggest that a combined treatment activating p53 and the vitamin D3
pathway may function via induction of CST5.

Introduction

implicated vitamin D3 in reducing cancer risk, progression
and mortality with promising results especially in colon
cancer [12-20]. Several large-scale clinical trials aiming
to determine the therapeutic value of vitamin D3 are
expected to be finalized within the next five years [21].
Vitamin D3, the precursor of the hormonally active
calcitriol, is mainly synthesized in the skin after exposure
to sunlight but is also supplied by nutritional sources [22].
Two hydroxylation steps mediated by the hydroxylases
CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 in the liver and in the kidney,
respectively, lead to the active vitamin D3 metabolite
calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3) [23]. Interestingly, CYP27B1 is
also expressed at extra-renal sites including brain, colon,

During the last years the role of vitamin D,
primarily vitamin D3, in tumor suppression has attracted
considerable attention (reviewed in [1-4]). There is now
increasing evidence strongly suggesting that vitamin D3
reduces the risk of developing cancer and may be applied
for the treatment of cancer as it was shown to induce
differentiation and apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation
and angiogenesis (reviewed in [5]). A tumor suppressive
effect of vitamin D3 has also been shown in vivo in
animal models of colon, breast and prostate cancer [611]. In addition, several epidemiological studies have

pancreas or skin and mediates local conversion of the
intermediate metabolite 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)
D3) to calcitriol [24]. Calcitriol binds to the vitamin D
receptor (VDR), which regulates the expression of several
genes involved in colorectal cancer, such as BIRC5,
CDKN1A, CDH1 or HIF1α (reviewed in [5]). Recently,
calcitriol-induced expression of cystatin D (CST5) was
shown to inhibit proliferation, migration, anchorageindependent growth as well as tumor formation of
xenografted colorectal cancer cell lines [25]. Moreover,
poor differentiation of colorectal tumors correlates with
decreased CST5 expression [25].
Cystatin D is an endogenous inhibitor of cystein
proteases, such as the cathepsins S, H and L [26,
27]. Cysteine cathepsins are lysosomal proteases and
are often upregulated in different types of cancers.
During tumorigenesis cathepsins are translocated from
intracellular compartments, typically lysosomes, to the
outer cell-membrane or secreted into the extracellular
space. Cathepsins promote tumor progression via
degradation of components of the basement membrane,
extracellular matrix or cleavage of the adhesion molecule
E-cadherin (reviewed in [28]).
The p53 transcription factor is one of the most
important tumor suppressors as also evidenced by
its common inactivation in human tumors [29].
Several different stress signals including oncogene
activation, oxidative stress or DNA damage lead to its
posttranslational stabilization and subsequent association
with binding sites within promoters [30], which are
composed of two half sites of RRRCWWGYYY (R:
purine, W: adenine or thymine, Y: pyrimidine) divided by
a spacer of 0 - 13 bp [31, 32]. Once activated, p53 exerts
diverse tumor suppressive effects through a large number
of target genes [33]. Interestingly, p53 directly induces the
expression of the VDR [34, 35]. Moreover, the CDKN1A
promoter harbors p53 and VDR binding sites suggesting
the possibility of coordinated regulations after p53 and
VDR activation [36]. Furthermore, calcitriol induces
MDM2 expression in a p53-dependent manner therefore
limiting p53 activation [37]. In addition, mutant p53 may
convert the effect of vitamin D3 by modulating VDRmediated transcription [38].
Here, we show that p53 directly induces CST5
expression by binding to a p53 response element
upstream of the CST5 promoter. We present evidence that
a combination of p53 activation and calcitriol treatment
results in enhanced CST5 expression and suppression of
the EMT transcription factor SNAIL. Furthermore, we
show that upregulation of CST5 by p53 contributes to
the induction of mesenchymal-epithelial transition. In
addition, we demonstrate that SNAIL directly represses
CST5 expression and that calcitriol treatment reverses this
effect.

p53 induces CST5 expression
We had previously observed a ~6-fold increase of
CST5 protein by pulsed SILAC and a ~9-fold induction
of CST5 mRNA expression by RNA-Seq analysis after
addition of doxycycline (DOX) to activate expression
of ectopic p53 in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480
harboring a pRTR-p53-VSV vector for 48 and 40
hours, respectively (Hünten et al., submitted). Here, we
confirmed the upregulation of the CST5 protein by p53
by Western blot analysis (Figure 1A). As expected, p53
expression also resulted in the induction of the known p53
target p21. The kinetics of induction by p53 were similar
for p21 and CST5: at 24 hours an induction was detectable
and by 72 hours both proteins were still elevated. After
p53 activation, CST5 mRNA expression displayed a
similar induction as p21 (Figure 1B). Recently, CST5 was
shown to be induced by vitamin D3 via direct binding of
the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to its promoter in human
colon cancer cell lines [25]. In addition, the VDR gene is a
known p53 target [34]. To determine whether p53 induces
CST5 in a VDR-independent manner, VDR-deficient
HEK293T cells were transfected with a DOX-inducible
pRTR-p53-VSV vector (Figure 1C). Activation of p53
expression by treatment with DOX resulted in a significant
induction of CST5 and, as a control, p21 mRNA. These
results show that p53 induces CST5 expression in a VDRindependent manner. An immunofluorescence analysis
confirmed increased CST5 protein levels after ectopic
p53 expression and showed its predominant cytoplasmic
localization after DOX treatment in SW480/pRTR-p53VSV cells (Figure 1D).

Endogenous p53 mediates induction of CST5 by
DNA damage
To further interrogate the p53-dependency of the
CST5 expression, the colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116
and RKO and their isogenic p53-deficient variants, which
were generated by homologous recombination [39], were
treated with either nutlin-3a, a small-molecule inhibitor
of MDM2 [40], or the DNA-damaging agent etoposide
(Figure 2). Both treatments resulted in a time-dependent
upregulation of CST5 in HCT116 p53+/+ cells (Figure
2A). Since CST5 expression was not induced in HCT116
p53-/- cells, the activation of CST5 transcription was
mediated by p53. Also RKO cells showed a p53-dependent
induction of CST5 after induction of DNA damage by
etoposide (Figure 2B). The p53-dependent induction of
p21 mRNA was more pronounced than the induction of
CST5 expression in RKO and HCT116 cells (Figure 2C,
2D). Taken together, these results show that p53 mediates

at this site was confirmed by qChIP analysis in SW480/
pRTR-p53-VSV cells treated with DOX for 16 hours,
whereas no enrichment was detected in the control cell line
SW480/pRTR (Figure 3C). After DNA damage induced by
etoposide, HCT116 p53+/+, but not HCT116 p53-/- cells,
displayed increased p53 occupancy at this site (Figure

binding sites. Together with the results presented above,
these findings establish CST5 as a direct transcriptional
target of p53.

CST5 is a direct p53 target
In a genome-wide p53/ChIP-Seq analysis we had
detected ChIP-signals in the vicinity of the CST5 promoter
indicating direct p53 binding (Figure 3A; Hünten et al.,
submitted). A sequence that fits well to the p53 binding
consensus sequence [31, 32] was identified 1106 basepairs upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of
CST5 underneath a ChIP-signal with ~10 reads (Figure
3A). This p53 binding element was conserved between
human and rat CST5 promoters (Figure 3B). p53 binding

expression (Figure 4A). In the presence of CST5 silencing
the p53-mediated repression of SNAIL protein was less
pronounced than in cells transfected with control siRNAs
(Figure 4A). The same effect was observed on the level
of mRNA expression (Figure 4B). Subsequently, we
determined whether downregulation of CST5 influences
p53-mediated inhibition of cellular migration in a scratch/
wound-closure assay and in a Boyden-chamber assay
(Figure 4C-4E). When CST5 was silenced by siRNAs,
wound closure of SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells was
generally less suppressed by p53 than in control cells
(Figure 4C, 4D). Also in a Boyden-chamber assay a
reduction in the inhibition of migration by p53 after
treatment with siCST5 was observed (Figure 4E). Taken
together, these results show that the induction of CST5
by p53 contributes to the inhibition of migration by p53.

Recently, the active metabolite of vitamin D3,
calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3), was shown to induce CST5
expression in colorectal cancer cells [25]. To examine
whether a combination of p53 activation and treatment
with calcitriol may lead to an enhanced CST5 induction,
we treated the colorectal cancer cell line SW480/pRTRp53-VSV with DOX, calcitriol or both agents (Figure 5).
As shown before, induction of ectopic p53 expression led
to a robust increase in CST5 expression on the mRNA
level (Figure 5A). Calcitriol treatment alone resulted in
a comparatively minor induction in CST5 expression,
whereas the combination of DOX and calcitriol led to
significantly higher CST5 mRNA levels when compared
to single DOX or calcitriol treatments. Furthermore, CST5
protein induction was more pronounced after combined
activation of p53 and the VDR when compared to addition

EMT transcription factor SNAIL displayed a stronger
decrease on the mRNA and protein level after a combined
treatment with DOX and calcitriol when compared to each
stimulus alone (Figure 5B, 5C).

Since we had observed that VDR activation by
exposure to calcitriol results in the induction of CST5
expression and in the repression of SNAIL, we asked
whether conversely SNAIL may directly or indirectly
lead to repression of CST5 as part of a SNAIL-induced
EMT program. Indeed, CST5 mRNA levels decreased by

up to 80% after induction of SNAIL by DOX treatment
in SW480/pRTR-SNAIL-VSV cells (Figure 6A). To
determine whether this repression is mediated directly by
SNAIL occupancy at the CST5 promoter, we inspected
this region for E-boxes, which may mediate SNAIL
binding. We identified several E-boxes upstream of the
CST5 promoter and could confirm the direct binding of
SNAIL to an E-box, which is located 50 bp upstream of
the CST5 promoter, using qChIP analysis (Figure 6B,
6C). The SNAIL binding site in the E-cadherin/CDH1
promoter served as a positive control. Next, we assessed
the combined effect of SNAIL activation with calcitriol
treatment in SW480/pRTR-SNAIL-VSV cells (Figure
6D). When ectopic SNAIL expression was combined with
calcitriol treatment, CST5 was no longer repressed by
SNAIL but showed a five-fold induction. Treatment with
calcitriol alone led to a robust induction of CST5, whereas

SNAIL mRNA levels were not affected. Therefore,
induction of CST5 expression by VDR activation is
dominant over its repression by SNAIL. As discussed
below, this may at least partially explain the effect of
vitamin D3 in the treatment of cancer.

Discussion
Here we identified CST5, which encodes cystatin
D, an inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, as a new p53
target. Furthermore, we showed that CST5 mediates, at
least in part, some of the tumor suppressive functions of
p53 in colorectal cancer cells (summarized in Figure 7).
We showed that CST5 is directly induced by p53, which
occupies a canonical p53 binding site upstream of the
CST5 promoter. Furthermore, we identified SNAIL as a

Figure 7: The p53 - vitamin D3 - CST5 regulatory network. Schematic model of CST5 regulation integrating the results of
this study (marked with orange arrows) with previous findings (marked with black arrows). Vitamin D3, that is converted to its active
metabolite calcitriol, induces CST5 via the vitamin D receptor (VDR) [25]. In addition, p53 can positively influence CST5 expression via
different pathways. p53 directly induces VDR which might lead to the induction of CST5 [34]. Furthermore, p53 directly binds to a p53
BS upstream of the CST5 promoter. And third, p53 can indirectly repress SNAIL expression [65, 66, 70] which results in the induction of
CST5. Moreover, CST5 expression indirectly leads to the repression of SNAIL by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF
complexes [25]. Upon induction, CST5 promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transition to suppress tumor progression and metastasis.

direct repressor of CST5.
Recently, individual cysteine cathepsins were shown
to have diverse roles during tumorigenesis [28, 41]. A
study in a mouse model of pancreatic islet cell tumors
suggested a multistep process integrating several members
of the cysteine cathepsin family that induce angiogenesis,
degradation of the basement membrane, tumor growth
and invasion [41, 42]. Different members of the cystatin
family of protease inhibitors are known to inhibit the
protumorigenic actions of cathepsins. For example,
cystatin M exerts tumor suppressive effects by inhibiting
cell proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer
cells and is epigenetically silenced in breast cancer [43,
44]. Cystatin D presumably plays an important role as a
mediator of tumor suppression in colon cancer cells and
is directly induced by the VDR [25] (see also Figure 7).
Furthermore, CST5 expression negatively correlates with
human colon cancer progression emphasizing its potential
tumor suppressive role for colorectal cancer [25]. By
showing that p53 directly induces the expression of CST5,
we uncovered a new mechanism as to how p53 inhibits
tumor progression and growth.
Vitamin D3 is a prohormone, which mainly controls
bone mineralization by regulating calcium and phosphate
metabolism. During the last years there has been
increasing evidence that vitamin D3 deficiency enhances
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality [5]. In addition
to convincing tumor suppressive effects of vitamin D3 in
in vivo and in vitro studies, meta-analyses of clinical trial
results also provided evidence for a tumor suppressive
effect of vitamin D3 (reviewed in [1]). Furthermore,
several studies showed a negative correlation between
25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) serum levels, a
marker allowing an overall estimation of the vitamin
D3 status, and cancer incidence [45] or overall survival
[46], especially for colorectal cancer [20, 47]. Notably, a
30 – 40% reduction of colon cancer risk in patients with
high 25(OH)D3 serum levels was observed [14]. This is in
line with the notion that the risk of colorectal cancer can
be strongly influenced by primary prevention including
physical activity or diet [48]. Given the strong evidence
that vitamin D3 may decrease the risk for colorectal cancer
and the world-wide shortage of vitamin D3 alimentation
[49], a feasible approach for reducing colorectal cancer
incidence and risk would be to increase vitamin D3
uptake by nutritional sources or its synthesis in the skin by
exposure to sunlight. Notably, the VDR is highly expressed
in early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis but decreases in
advanced stages [50-54]. Also p53 mutation is a late event
in colorectal cancer development that mostly occurs during
the transition from adenoma to carcinoma [55]. Therefore,
a combination of p53-activation and calcitriol treatment
to enhance CST5 induction might be more effective in
early tumor stages. In case p53 is mutated, a combination
of small molecules reactivating mutant p53, such as
PRIMA or MIRA-1 [56], together with calcitriol (or an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

analog to avoid hypercalcemia by high vitamin D3 doses)
may lead to the inhibition of cancer progression. Similar
approaches combining calcitriol with different known anticancer agents, such as doxorubicin or cisplatin, to achieve
an enhanced anti-tumor effect have been conducted in
several in vitro and in vivo analyses [57-64]. This provides
an opportunity for successful anticancer treatment if
chemotherapy alone is not effective. Furthermore, we
found that the direct induction of CST5 by p53 is, at least
in part, required for the induction of MET by p53. Several
other p53 target genes, among them the miR-34, miR-200
and miR-15a/16-1 genes, are likely to also contribute to
the anti-migratory effects of p53 [65-68].
It has been shown that ectopic expression of CST5
indirectly leads to the repression of SNAIL presumably
via the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of
β-catenin/TCF complexes [25]. In our study we could
show that SNAIL binds upstream of the CST5 promoter
to suppress CST5 expression and that this repression can
be suppressed by treating the cells with calcitriol. It has
been shown before that SNAIL can directly repress VDR
which might also contribute to the inhibition of CST5 by
SNAIL [69]. However, direct binding of SNAIL to the
CST5 promoter has not been demonstrated until now.
Since SNAIL-mediated repression of CST5 is abrogated
by calcitriol treatment, calcitriol may inhibit tumor
progression even in cells that show high SNAIL expression
and therefore have a high tumorigenic potential. Others
and we have previously shown that SNAIL expression is
downregulated by p53 via the induction of miR-34a [65,
66]. Alternatively, p53 may indirectly suppress SNAIL
via MDM2 [70]. Therefore, p53 presumably activates
CST5 expression by direct and SNAIL-mediated indirect
mechanisms, which together form a feed-forward loop.
Taken together, our findings reveal that CST5
represents an important mediator of p53 tumor
suppression by mediating MET. Notably, CST5 expression
decreases during human colon cancer progression [25].
The possibility to reactivate CST5 expression by dietary
vitamin D3 or/and p53 activation suggests that our
findings may have potential therapeutic implications.

Size 0.31 µm; laser power 2%; Master gain 600-1000.

Western blot analysis
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed
according to standard protocols. Cells were lysed in RIPA
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% (w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% Sodium
Dodecylsulfate, complete mini protease inhibitor tablets
(Roche)). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at
16.060  g for 15  min, 4°C. 100  µg of whole cell lysate
per lane was separated using 10% SDS-Acrylamide
gels and transferred on Immobilon PVDF membranes
(Millipore). ECL signals were recorded using a CF440
Imager (Kodak). Antibodies used: CST5 (Santa Cruz, sc46890, 1:200), p21 (Neomarkers, CP-74, 1:1000), SNAIL
(R&D Systems, AF3639, 1:250), β-actin (Sigma, A2066,
1:1000).

Wound healing assay
SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells were seeded into
culture inserts (Ibidi, 80241) and transfected with a siRNA
against CST5 or the respective control for 48 hours. After
42 hours, p53 expression was induced by adding DOX to
the indicated samples. Mitomycin C [10 ng/ml] was added
for 2 hours before the scratch was applied. To remove
mitomycin C and detached cells, cells were washed twice
in HBSS +/+ and medium with or without DOX was
added. Cells were allowed to close the wound for 48 hours
and images were captured on an Axiovert Observer Z.1
microscope connected to an AxioCam MRm camera using
the Axiovision software (Zeiss).

Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the High Pure RNA
Isolation Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer´s
instructions. 1 µg of total RNA per sample was used
for cDNA-generation using anchored oligo(dT) primers
(Ambion Verso Kit). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was
performed by using the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and the LightCycler 480 (Roche).
Only oligonucleotide pairs resulting in a single peak in the
melting curve analysis were used. For sequences of the
oligonucleotides used for qPCR see Table 1.

Migration analysis in boyden-chambers
SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV cells were seeded in
triplicates into 6-well plates and transfected with siRNA
against CST5 or the respective control for 48 hours. For
the last 24 hours previous to the analysis, cells were serum
deprived (0.1% serum). To analyse migration, 3x105 cells
were seeded in the upper chamber of a Boyden Chamber
(8 µm pore size; Corning) in serum free medium. After

ChIP-sequencing

42 hours, p53 expression was induced by adding 100 ng/
ml DOX to the indicated samples. 10% FCS was used
as a chemo-attractant and placed in the lower chamber.
Cultures were maintained for 48 hours, then non-motile
cells at the top of the filter were removed and the cells
in the bottom chamber were fixed with methanol and
stained with DAPI. Cell numbers in three different fields
per condition were enumerated by immunofluorescence
microscopy. The average number of cells in three fields
per membrane was counted in triplicates. The relative
migration is expressed as the value of treated cells to
control cells with the control set as one.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed
as described above. The immunoprecipitated DNAfragments were quantified using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). Libraries were generated using a ChIP-Seq
Sample Prep Kit (Illumina Part # 11257047) according
to the manufacturer´s instructions and sequenced on a
HiSeq 2000 device (Illumina). 101-nt sequence reads
were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly. The complete
ChIP-Seq results will be published elsewhere (Hünten et
al., submitted).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Statistical analysis

SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV, DLD1/pRTR-SNAILVSV and HCT116 cells were cultured as described
above. Before cross-linking, SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV
and DLD1/pRTR-SNAIL-VSV cells were treated with
DOX for 24 hours to induce ectopic expression of p53
or SNAIL, respectively, and HCT116 cells were treated
with etoposide for 16 hours to induce endogenous
p53 expression. Cross-linking was performed with
formaldehyde (Merck) at a final concentration of 1% and
terminated for SW480/pRTR-p53-VSV and DLD1/pRTRSNAIL-VSV after five minutes, for HCT116 cells after
ten minutes by addition of glycine at a final concentration
of 0.125 M. Cells were harvested using SDS buffer
(50 mM Tris pH 8.1, 0.5% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA) and after pelleting resuspended in IP buffer (2
parts of SDS buffer and 1 part Triton dilution buffer (100
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.6, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH
8.0, 0.2% NaN3, 5.0% Triton X-100)). Chromatin was
sheared by sonication (HTU SONI 130, G. Heinemann) to
generate DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp.
Preclearing and incubation was performed with polyclonal
VSV (V4888, Sigma) antibody or IgG control (M-7023,
Sigma) using A sepharose beads for SW480/pRTR-p53VSV and DLD1/pRTR-SNAIL-VSV cells for 16 hours as
previously described [72]. The monoclonal DO-1 antibody
(Santa Cruz, sc-126) in combination with sepharose
G beads was used for the HCT116 cells. Washing and
reversal of cross-linking was performed as described in
[73]. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qRTPCR. For oligonucleotides used for qChIP see Table 2.

A Student´s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used to
determine significant differences between two groups of
samples. p-values < 0.05 were considered as significant
(*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001).
