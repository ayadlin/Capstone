Abstract:
Aberrant DNA methylation plays a relevant role in multiple myeloma (MM)
pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that
recently emerged as master regulator of gene expression by targeting protein-coding
mRNAs. However, miRNAs involvement in the regulation of the epigenetic machinery
and their potential use as therapeutics in MM remain to be investigated. Here, we
provide evidence that the expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)
is deregulated in MM cells. Moreover, we show that miR-29b targets DNMT3A and
DNMT3B mRNAs and reduces global DNA methylation in MM cells. In vitro transfection
of MM cells with synthetic miR-29b mimics significantly impairs cell cycle progression
and also potentiates the growth-inhibitory effects induced by the demethylating agent
5-azacitidine. Most importantly, in vivo intratumor or systemic delivery of synthetic
miR-29b mimics, in two clinically relevant murine models of human MM, including
the SCID-synth-hu system, induces significant anti-tumor effects. All together, our
findings demonstrate that aberrant DNMTs expression is efficiently modulated by
tumor suppressive synthetic miR-29b mimics, indicating that methyloma modulation
is a novel matter of investigation in miRNA-based therapy of MM.

INTRODUCTION

Changes in DNA methylation are key epigenetic features
known to regulate gene expression. In mammalians, DNA
methylation is characterized by an enzymatic addition
of a methyl group at the carbon 5 position of cytosine in
the context of the sequence 5’ cytosine-guanosine (CpG)
through DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) activity[9].
CpG dinucleotides are clustered in regions, named CpGislands, present in almost 60% of all gene promoters
[10]. Once hyper-methylated, CpG-islands mediate genetranscriptional silencing [11]. DNMT isoforms, including

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal malignancy of
bone marrow plasma cells that develops as a consequence
of a multistep transformation process [1-3]. Several
genetic lesions associated to the activation of signal
transduction pathways, which stimulate MM cell survival
and proliferation, have been elucidated in the past decade
[1-7]. Presently, there is growing evidence that epigenetic
events play a major role in MM pathogenesis [8, 9].

DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, have distinct roles
in genomic methylation[12]: DNMT3A and DNMT3B
are responsible for de novo DNA methylation, whereas
DNMT1 accounts for replicating the DNA methylation
pattern in genomic DNA [13]. A number of studies
suggest that DNMT genes are frequently overexpressed in
human cancer and in the cell transformation process [1417], though mutations of DNMT genes might also occur
[18]. DNMTs overexpression is produced by different
mechanisms, including aberrant cell cycle control,
increased mRNA and protein stability, and E2-F-mediated
DNMTs promoter activation [19, 20]. Most importantly,
silencing of tumor suppressor genes by aberrant DNA
hyper-methylation has been reported in hematologic
malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia [21] and
multiple myeloma [8, 22].
Recent evidence supports a role for microRNAs
(miRNAs) as relevant players in aberrant mechanisms
of DNA hyper-methylation [23, 24]. MiRNAs are an
evolutionarily conserved class of small non-coding

RNAs (20-24 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression
via complete or partial matching to target genes at the 3’
untranslated region (UTR), causing suppression of protein
translation or messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation
[25]. To date, no evidence of miRNAs involvement
in antagonizing aberrant methylation in MM has been
reported. Moreover, although their involvement in the
pathogenesis of MM has been underlined by several
observations, only few miRNAs have been evaluated as
therapeutic agents in the treatment of this disease [26, 27].
In the present study, we evaluated whether miR29b could inhibit de novo DNMTs expression. Moreover,
synthetic miR-29b oligonucleotides formulated with a
novel Neutral Lipid Emulsion (NLE) [28] delivery system
were used to evaluate the effect of miR-29b in different
and clinically relevant murine xenograft models of human
MM, including the most innovative SCID-synth-hu system
[29], which recapitulates the growth of human MM
cells within the human bone marrow microenvironment
(huBMM)[30].

1B), suggesting a potential role of de novo DNMTs in
malignant transformation; conversely, DNMT1 levels
were lower in cancer cells compared to normal PCs
(Supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether the bone

proliferation and supports the survival of MM cells, could
affect de novo DNMTs expression, KMS12 and NCI-H929
MM cell lines were cultured for 12 or 24 hours adherent

We first evaluated the expression of DNMT3A,
DNMT3B and DNMT1 mRNAs on a dataset of highdensity cDNA-microarrays of primary CD138+ cells from
intramedullary MM (n=55) or PCL (n=5) patients and
from normal healthy donors (PCs, n=4). As compared
to normal CD138+ cells, PCs from MM and PCL
patients showed higher expression of DNMT3A (Fig.

milieu might influence DNA methylation of MM cells.

On the basis of these findings we investigated whether
miR-29b inhibition could up-regulate de novo DNMTs
expression. SKMM1 cells were stably transduced with
a lentiviral vector carrying the antagomiR-29b; miR-29b
levels after transduction are reported in Supplemental
Fig. 2. Of note, miR-29b inhibition indeed led to upregulation of both DNMT3A and DNMT3B protein levels,
as assessed by western blotting analysis (Fig. 2D, right
panel). It was possible to conclude that miR-29b is a
direct regulator of DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression
in MM cells. These findings also suggested that miR-29b
could induce epigenetic modifications in cancer cells.
To address this issue, we transfected either NCI-H929
or U266 MM cells with miR-29b synthetic mimics or
scrambled oligonucleotides and the global methylation
levels were measured by a well established luminometric
method [33]. MiR-29b levels after transfection are
reported in supplemental Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 2E,
miR-29b transfection resulted in a robust reduction

miR-29b targets de novo DNMTs in MM cells
In silico search for target prediction [31, 32]
indicates that both DNMT3A and DNMT3B are bona fide
targets of miR-29b. To validate this interaction in MM
cells, INA-6 cells were co-transfected with synthetic miR29b or scrambled oligonucleotides (NC), together with an
expression vector carrying the 3’UTR of DNMT3A or
DNMT3B mRNA cloned downstream to the luciferase
reporter gene. Figure 2A shows miR-29b levels after
transfection. A significantly lower luciferase activity
in INA-6 cells transfected with miR-29b mimics as
compared to control was detected (Fig. 2B). Consistently,
miR-29b transfection reduced DNMT3A and DNMT3B
mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D, left panel),
as assessed by q-RT-PCR and western blotting analysis.

supporting its role in the epigenetic control of MM cells.

Inverse correlation between miR-29b and

We subsequently studied in vitro effects produced
by targeting de novo DNMTs in MM cells. In details,
NCI-H929 MM cells were stably transduced with two
different shRNAs against DNMT3A or DNMT3B or with
a scrambled control. After lentiviral transduction, cells
were selected with puromycin and levels of DNMT3A
and DNMT3B mRNAs were analyzed by q-RT-PCR
(Supplemental Fig. 5). Interestingly, de novo DNMTs
silencing significantly altered cell cycle of MM cells,
as revealed by both the strong decrease in S-phase and
the relevant increase in hypodiploid cells, indicative of
apoptosis, in cells silenced for DNMT3A and DNMT3B
compared to scrambled-transduced cells (Fig. 4A). These
findings indicate that de novo DNMTs represent promising

To assess the relevance of the interaction between
miR-29b and de novo DNMTs, we analyzed the correlation
between miR-29b and DNMT3A or DNMT3B mRNA
levels in a panel of 17 MM cell lines. Raw microarray
expression levels for DNMT3A, DNMT3B and miR29b are reported in Supplemental Fig. 4. Notably, such
integrated analysis highlighted an inverse correlation
between miR-29b and DNMT3B expression levels
(p=0,0012), whereas no correlation between miR-29b and
DNMT3A could be demonstrated (Fig. 3).

targets for therapeutic intervention in MM. Then, we
studied the effects induced by synthetic miR-29b mimics,
alone or in combination with the demethylating agent
5-azacitidine, on cell growth and cell cycle regulation
of MM cells. In vitro transfection of synthetic miR-29b
mimics decreased cell growth in a time-dependent manner
and potentiated 5-azacitidine anti-proliferative effects at
72 hours (percentage of growth inhibition at 72 hours
were 45%, 35% and 65% for miR-29b, 5-azacitidine and
combination treatment respectively; Fig. 4B). Cell cycle
analysis revealed that miR-29b induced apoptosis, as
assessed by the increase of hypodiploid cell percentage,
to an extent similar to that caused by 5-azacitidine; the

combined treatment produced, at 72 hours, an increase
of apoptosis and decrease in S-phase as compared to
miR-29b or 5-azacitidine treatment alone (Fig. 4C).
These results suggest that the potentiation on cell growth
inhibition is likely due to the perturbation of cell cycle
distribution and to the increase of apoptosis occurrence.

Synthetic miR-29b mimics exert anti-MM activity
in vivo
The effect of miR-29b on MM cell growth in vivo
was evaluated in 2 different experimental systems. In a
first model, we explored the in vivo anti-tumor potential of

via tail vein. Following 3 injections (3 days apart), a
significant anti-tumor effect of NLE-formulated miR-29b
was detected (Fig. 5C). We observed significant tumor
growth inhibition (p<0.05) in mice treated with miR-29b
mimics, together with 2-fold increase of miR-29b levels
(Fig. 5D) and down-regulation of both DNMT3A and
DNMT3B mRNA levels (Fig. 5E) as assessed by qRTPCR analysis of the excised tumors. Notably, miRNAs
administration did not produce any significant behavioral
changes or weight loss in treated animals. No pathologic
features were detected by histological analysis of tissues,
including liver, lung, kidney and bone marrow of treated
mice, clearly indicating absence of acute toxicity (not
shown).
Finally, we evaluated the effect of miR-29b mimics
in SCID-synth-hu mice [29]. In this model, MM cells
adhere to BMSCs within a 3D biopolymeric scaffold into
immunocompromised mice, recapitulating MM growth
within an adult BM MM-derived milieu. We used the
bone marrow-dependent INA-6 cells to evaluate if miR29b overcome the growth-supportive effect induced by the

miR-29b on MM xenografts in SCID mice by intratumor
delivery of synthetic miR-29b-mimics. SKMM1 MM
cells were injected in a cohort of 15 mice and when
tumors became palpable, mice were randomized into 3
groups and treated intratumorally with synthetic miR-29b
mimics, miR-NC or vehicle alone. To achieve an efficient
delivery of miR-29b or miR-NC, we formulated synthetic
miR-29b-mimics with NLE particles [28], a novel in vivo
delivery system for oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig.
5A, repeated intratumor injection of NLE-formulated
synthetic miR-29b (1mg/Kg; 5 injections, 3 days apart),
significantly inhibited growth of MM xenografts. Our
findings demonstrate that the delivery of synthetic miR29b mimics exerts anti-MM activity in vivo. Importantly,
the growth-inhibitory effect well correlated with miR29b accumulation in tumor tissues (Fig. 5B), as assessed
by q-RT-PCR in retrieved xenografts. We next explored
the potential anti-tumor activity of systemic delivered
formulated miR-29b mimics. Xenografted mice were
randomized to receive synthetic miR-29b or miR-NC
(1mg/kg per mouse), each formulated with NLE particles,

of retrieved 3D biopolymeric scaffolds after treatment with
synthetic miR-29b showed indeed increased expression of

All together, these findings indicate that miR-29b
exerts anti-tumor activity in vivo, providing a strong
rationale for clinical development of synthetic miR-29b
mimics in MM.

hypermethylated in MM cells. TSGs hypermethylation
confers an adverse outcome in MM patients [39-43]. A
follow-up study will shade light on TSGs under miR-29b
regulation by DNA-methylation control.
In the present report, we also provide insights into
biological effects triggered by synthetic miR-29b mimics
in vitro and in vivo. Tumor suppressive role of miR-29b
has been previously reported in solid tumors [24, 44]
and haematologic malignancies [45], although it remains
controversial in CLL [46]. In our experimental model, in
vitro transfection of synthetic miR-29b mimics in MM
cells promoted apoptosis and cell cycle perturbations,
and similar effects were observed when DNMT3A and
DNMT3B were silenced by shRNAs, just confirming the
thought that these enzymes are valuable targets for antitumor treatment. Moreover, synthetic miR-29b mimics
potentiated the growth-inhibitory effects of the DNMTinhibitor 5-azacitidine [47], suggesting new strategies
based upon DNA-demethylating agents/miRNAs
combination in the treatment of MM. The in vivo antitumor potential of miR-29b was demonstrated in different
clinically relevant murine models of human MM. Our
experimental platform was based on xenografts of MM
cells that were exposed to synthetic miR-29b mimics
delivered via NLE, a novel lipid-based delivery system.
In order to additionally support the clinical translation of
our experimental approach, we also studied the in vivo
activity of miR-29b mimics using the novel SCID-synthhu model of human MM [29]. In this biosynthetic and
orthotopic model, tumor cells grow within a bone-like 3D
biopolymeric scaffold previously engrafted with human
BMSCs, recapitulating a human BM milieu in SCID
mice. In this model, delivery of systemic miR-29b mimics
induced significant anti-tumor effects, as demonstrated
by immunohistochemical analysis of retrieved scaffolds,
demonstrating the ability of miR-29b to overcome the
protective role of BMSCs.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that miR-29b
controls the methylation profile of MM cells suggesting
that miR-29b down-regulation may play a relevant role
in MM pathophysiology by reducing TSGs expression.
Moreover, miR-29b mimics appear a promising agent
in the treatment of MM, alone or in combination with
demethylating drugs.

DISCUSSION
A number of complex and interdependent epigenetic
modifications are involved in cancer development and
progression [34]. Alteration of DNA methylation has been
reported in hematologic malignancies like acute myeloid
leukemia [35] as well as in solid tumors [36, 37], which
often display increased levels of DNMTs compared
to their normal counterpart, suggesting that DNMTs
overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis [35]. In the
present work, we show that de novo DNMTs mRNA
levels are increased in MM and PCL primary samples,
indicating a potential role of altered DNA methylation in
myelomagenesis. Most importantly, we provide the first
evidence that the huBMM increases de novo DNMTs
expression and therefore could interfere with epigenetic
control of MM cell growth and survival.
MiRNAs recently emerged as key players in MM
pathophysiology [26]. To investigate the relationship
between the miRNA network and de novo DNMTs in MM,
we studied the regulatory role of miR-29b on DNMTs
expression and global DNA methylation in MM cells.
Indeed, bioinformatic analysis revealed that DNMT3A
and DNMT3B are miR-29b targets, according with
previous studies which reported the ability of members
of the miR-29-family to target DNMTs in solid tumors
and AML [24, 38]. Interestingly, the integrated analysis of
miRNA/mRNA profiling revealed an inverse correlation
between miR-29b and DNMT3B in a panel of 17 MM cell
lines, underscoring a key role of miR-29b on DNMT3B
regulation.
We here demonstrate that synthetic miR-29b mimics
specifically bind the 3’UTR of DNMT3A and DNMT3B,
resulting in downregulation of both DNMTs at mRNA
and protein level; conversely, miR-29b inhibition by
antagomiRs led to increased DNMTs expression levels.
Notably, miR-29b mimics resulted in epigenetic changes,
as demonstrated by an approximately 2-fold decrease in
global DNA methylation in MM cells. At our knowlewdge,
this is the first evidence that a microRNA is able to
affect the methylation profile in MM cells. Our results
are in line with previous reports showing that enforced
expression of miR-29b reduces global DNA methylation
in AML and NSCLC cells, restoring the expression of
methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs).

Transduced cells underwent two rounds of infection (8
hours each round) and were selected in medium containing
1 µg/ml puromycin. To obtain MM cells stably expressing
antagomiR-29b, we used the lentiviral vector miRZip29b
anti-miR-29b construct (System Biosciences); lentiviral
particles production and transduction were performed
according to the above indicated protocols. Selection was
performed in medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin.

Quantitative real-time amplification of miRNAs
and mRNAs.

Gene Expression Profiling.

Total RNA from MM cells was prepared with the
TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer´s
instructions. The single-tube TaqMan miRNA assays
(Applied Biosystems, Assay id 000413) was used to
detect and quantify mature miR-29b according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, by the use of iQ5 multicolor
detection system (Bio-Rad). miR-29b expression was
normalized on RNU44 (Applied Biosystems, Assay Id
001094 ). For mRNA dosage studies, oligo-dT-primed
cDNA was obtained using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and then
used as template to quantify DNMT3A (Hs01027166_
m1) and DNMT3B (Hs00171876_m1) levels by TaqMan
assay (Applied Biosystems); normalization was performed
with GAPDH (Hs03929097_g1). Comparative real-time
polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) was performed
in triplicate, including no-template controls. Relative
expression was calculated using the comparative cross
threshold (Ct) method [52].

Gene expression profiles were analyzed on the
GeneChip® Human Gene 1.0 ST chip platform (Affymetrix
Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The raw intensity expression
values were processed by Robust Multi-array Average
(RMA) complete procedure (Irizarry Biostatistics 2003)
with the re-mapped Chip Definition Files (CDF) from
BrainArray libraries version 15.0.0 available at http://
brainarray.mbni.med.umich.edu/Brainarray/Database/
Custom CDF/ 15.0.0/entrezg.asp.

miRNA profiling.
MiRNA expression profiling was carried out
using Total RNA and Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 1.0
according to manufacturer’s recommended protocol.
Expression values were extracted with Affymetrix miRNA
QC tool (RMA normalized and log2-transformed).

In vitro transfection of MM cells with synthetic
miR-29b.

Luciferase reporter experiments.

Synthetic pre-miRNAs were purchased from
Ambion (Applied Biosystems). 1x106 cells were
electroporated with scrambled (miR-NC) or synthetic

tumors reached 2 cm in diameter or in the event of
paralysis or major compromise in their quality of life, to
prevent unnecessary suffering, as previously described
[54]. For our study, we used 2 different models of human
MM, including i) SCID mice bearing subcutaneous (sc)
MM xenografts [55]; and ii) SCID mice implanted with
a 3D polymeric scaffold previously reconstituted with
human bone marrow stromal cells and then injected with
INA6 human MM cells (SCID-synth-hu)[30].

described using 10μg of the firefly luciferase report; for
each plate, 100 nM of the synthetic miR-29b or miR-NC
were used. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were
measured consecutively using the dual-luciferase assay kit
(Promega) 24 hours after transfection.

DNA extraction and measurement of global DNA
methylation levels.

i) Xenograft of MM cell lines in SCID mice.

DNA was extracted by a commercial kit
(Invitrogen). The global DNA methylation levels of MM
cell lines transfected with syntehtic miR-29b mimics
or scrambled oligonucleotides (NC) were estimated
according to our previous report [33]. The data were
expressed as Global DNA Methylation Index (GDMi) by
dividing the mean net luminescence values for the HpaII
enzyme to the mean net luminescence values for the MspI
enzyme. Thus, the GDMi values inversely correlate to the
global DNA methylation levels.

For this model, mice were sc inoculated in the
interscapular area with 5 x 106 MM cells cells in 100 µL
RPMI-1640 medium. Treatment was initiated after the
detection of palpable tumors, approximately 3 weeks
following injection of MM cells. Tumor sizes were
measured weekly in 2 dimensions using a caliper, and
volume was calculated using the formula: V = 0.5 x a x b2,
where a and b are the long and short diameter of the tumor,
respectively, until the tumor was palpable. Mice were
randomized in 3 groups and treated with synthetic miR29b mimics or miR-NC or vehicle alone or PBS. Each
dose contained 20 µg synthetic oligo which equals 1mg/kg
per mouse with an average weight of 20g. Administration
of miRNA-mimics was performed by the use of the
novel formulation of neutral lipid emulsion (NLE)
(MaxSuppressor in vivo RNA Lancer II, BIOO Scientific,
Austin, TX) according to the manifacturer’s instructions.
Treatments were first performed intratumorally (i.t.) every
three days for a total of four injections. In a subsequent
series of experiments, treatments were performed
systemically via tail vein by using the same formulation
and dosage/schedule of the intratumoral injections.
Tumors were then collected and placed in either 10%
formalin for histology or in RNAlater for RNA isolation.

Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis.
For cell proliferation analysis, MM cells were plated
in 6 well plates, electroporated with miR-29b or miR-NC
and then harvested, plated at 1,5-2,0x105/mL, and counted
at 24-hour intervals using a Trypan Blue-exclusion assay.
Each sample was run at least in triplicate. Cell cycle
analysis was performed as previously reported [53].

Western blotting.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting (WB) were
performed according to standard protocols[35]. Briefly
cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 15mM Tris/HCl
pH 7.5, 120mM NaCl, 25mM KCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5%
Triton 100, Halt Protease Inhibitor Single-Use cocktail
(100X, Thermo Scientific). Whole cells lysates (50µg
per lane) were separated using 4-12% Novex Bis-Tris
SDS-acrylamide gels (Invitrogen), electro-transferred on
Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted
with the rabbit anti-DNMT3A, anti-DNMT3B or antiGAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antbodies.

ii) SCID-synth-hu model.
The SCID-synth-hu model was reproduced by
implantation into a SCID mouse of a three-dimensional
(3D) bone-like poly-∑-caprolactone polymeric scaffold
(PCLS)[29]. PCLS cylinders (7mm in length and 3mm
in diameter at scanning electron microscope SEM),
demonstrated interconnected large (100–300 mm) and
small pores (1–10 mm) resembling the micro-architecture
of a normal human adult bone, as described. Dynamic
seeding of BMSCs into PCLSs was performed as
previously reported. Briefly, using a suspension of 8x105
cells in 500 µl of growth medium, a 22-gauge needle on a
2.5 ml syringe was threaded into two ending faces of the
cylindrical scaffold. A medium flow rate of 500 µl/min
and three drawing cycles were carried out on both scaffold
ends. Before implantation, PCLSs were incubated in
complete medium at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h to allow cell
adhesion on 3D surfaces. Then, the PCLS was surgically
implanted sc into a SCID mouse flank. Chloralium hydrate
anesthesia (400 mg/kg, 0,15 ml) was used during all

Animals and in vivo models of human MM.
Male CB-17 severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice (6- to 8-weeks old; Harlan Laboratories,
Inc., Indianapolis) were housed and monitored in our
Animal Research Facility. All experimental procedures
and protocols had been approved by our Institutional
Ethical Committee and conducted according to protocols
approved by the National Directorate of Veterinary
Services (Italy). Procedures were performed as previously
described [53]. Briefly, mice were sacrified when their

surgical procedures. Three weeks thereafter, 8x105 bone
marrow-dependent INA-6 cells were injected in vivo into
previously implanted PCLSs coated ex vivo with human
derived BMSCs. Approximately one month later, when
sIL6R became detectable in mice sera, NLE-miR-29b
or -NC were injected directly into the scaffold (total of 7
injections, 2 days apart). In vivo effects induced by miR29b were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on retrieved
scaffolds at the end of treatments.
