Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a member of the
HIN-200 family of hematopoietic, IFN-inducible, nuclear
proteins, associated with both, infection defense and tumor
pathology. Recently, AIM2 was found to act as a DNA
sensor in innate immunity. In addition, we and others
have previously demonstrated a high frequency of AIM2alterations in microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) tumors.
To further elucidate AIM2 function in colorectal tumors,
we here addressed AIM2-responsive target genes by
microarray based gene expression proﬁling of 22 244
human genes. A total of 111 transcripts were signiﬁcantly
upregulated, whereas 80 transcripts turned out to be signiﬁcantly downregulated in HCT116 cells, constitutively
expressing AIM2, compared with AIM2-negative cells.
Among the upregulated genes that were validated by
quantitative PCR and western blotting we recognized
several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs: IFIT1,
IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI6, IRF7, ISG15, HLA-DRA, HLADRB, TLR3 and CIITA), as well as genes involved in
intercellular adhesion and matrix remodeling. Expression
of ISGs correlated with expression of AIM2 in 10
different IFN-c treated colorectal cancer cell lines.
Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down
of AIM2 resulted in reduced expression of HLA-DRA,
HLA-DRB and CIITA in IFN-c-treated cells. IFN-c
independent induction of HLA-DR genes and their
encoded proteins was also demonstrated upon doxycyclin-regulated transient induction of AIM2. Luciferase
reporter assays revealed induction of the HLA-DR
promoter upon AIM2 transfection in different cell lines.
STAT-signaling was not involved in IFN-c independent
induction of ISGs, arguing against participation of
cytokines released in an autostimulating manner. Our
data indicate that AIM2 mediates both IFN-c dependent
and independent induction of several ISGs, including
genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II antigens HLA-DR-a and -b. This

Introduction
Interferon-inducible Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2),
a member of the HIN-200 family of hematopoietic,
IFN-inducible, nuclear proteins, was recently found to
act as a DNA sensor in innate immunity (Schroder
et al., 2009). By direct binding to foreign double
stranded DNA in infected macrophages, AIM2 triggers
the assembly of an AIM2 inﬂammasome resulting in
caspase-1-mediated inﬂammatory responses and cell
death (Burckstummer et al., 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri
et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2009).
Moreover, the AIM2 inﬂammasome appears to be
essential for host defense against DNA viruses and cytosolic bacteria, such as Francisella tularensis and Listeria
monocytogenes (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2010; Rathinam et al., 2010; Sauer et al., 2010). Although this
activity places AIM2 function in the context of the cell’s
defense against infection, the role of AIM2 in carcinogenesis is less clear.
Both, tumor suppressive and tumor promoting functions of AIM2 have been reported. Exogenous AIM2
expression was shown to reduce human breast cancer
cell proliferation by inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional
activity and to suppress mammary tumor growth in a
mouse model (Chen et al., 2006). In addition, AIM2 is
frequently affected by genetic and epigenetic alterations
in different human tumor entities: In pre-neoplastic
and neoplastic microsatellite unstable (MSI) lesions, a
coding 10-bp polyadenine region in Exon 6 of the AIM2
gene appears to be positively selected for frameshift
mutations (Michel et al., 2010a; Woerner et al., 2003,
2005). Finally, we identiﬁed additional mutations
and epigenetic silencing of the AIM2 promoter, the

latter conferring insensitivity to IFN-g-induced AIM2
expression in MSI colorectal cancers (Woerner et al.,
2007). How this aberrant or missing AIM2 expression affects tumor cell fate and tumor immunity is
unknown. However, recent evidence suggests that the
immune response modulates the fate of human tumors.
Type, density and location of immune cells within
human colorectal tumors were shown to predict clinical
outcome (Galon et al., 2006). Furthermore, the high
local lymphocyte inﬁltration of MSI colorectal tumors,
which is associated with a low frequency of distant
metastases (Buckowitz et al., 2005) suggests that inﬂammatory mechanisms, including induction of IFN-gregulated target genes are involved in tumorigenesis.
Thus, considering the role of AIM2 in innate immunity
and intracellular DNA recognition, we hypothesized
that AIM2 expression in tumor cells may bridge cytokine release from tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells with
tumor cell fate.
By restoration of AIM2 expression in AIM2-deﬁcient
colorectal cancer cell lines, we recently demonstrated
that AIM2-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation is
associated with accumulation of cells at late S-phase,
resulting in G2/M arrest (Patsos et al., 2010). Remarkably, persistent AIM2 expression affected adhesion of
colorectal cancer cells to ﬁbronectin and stimulated
invasion through extracellular matrix-coated membrane
in transwell assays (Patsos et al., 2010). To further
elucidate the immunomodulating AIM2 function in
colorectal tumors, we here addressed AIM2-regulated
target genes by microarray based gene-expression
proﬁling of colorectal cancer cells. Our data indicate
that AIM2 mediates IFN-g-induced induction of several
Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) including genes
encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
II antigens HLA-DR-a and -b.
Results
Persistent AIM2 expression results in induction of
interferon stimulated genes, including HLA-DRA,
HLA-DRB and (class II transactivator) CIITA
To investigate the modulation of gene expression in
response to constitutive AIM2 expression we used

Table 1

Affymetrix microarray analysis for studying transcriptional changes in the AIM2-deﬁcient MSI-H tumor cell
line HCT116. Two recently characterized AIM2-expressing subclones (D1 and B8; Patsos et al., 2010) were
chosen for comparison with MOCK-transfected
HCT116 cells (subclone D3). Cluster analysis of the
data revealed that D1 and B8 subclones are similar to
each other but distinct from the control ((D3), data not
shown). Among the 22 244 genes tested on arrays, 111
transcripts were signiﬁcantly upregulated, whereas, 80
transcripts were signiﬁcantly downregulated more than
1,4-fold in both AIM2-expressing cell subclones (Table 1
and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). As expected, AIM2
was found to be the most upregulated gene, with a
slightly higher expression level in subclone B8 (Supplementary Table 2). A number of induced genes appear to
be linked to the immunomodulating function of AIM2,
such as the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) HLA-DRA,
HLA-DRB, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI6, IRF7, ISG15
and TLR3 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, genes involved in intercellular adhesion and matrix
remodeling (for example, COL9A3, COL12A1, COL13A1,
CSPG2, CTHRC1, ECM1, LOXL4, MCAM, NANOS1,
TIMP2, VIM and others) were found to be upregulated
in response to constitutive AIM2 expression (Supplementary Table 2), which is in line with our previous
ﬁndings of AIM2 affecting cell migration and invasion
(Patsos et al., 2010).
The gene expression proﬁle in AIM2-transfected cells
was validated by quantitative real-time PCR of selected
genes from independent samples of subclones D1 and
B8 versus the control. As shown in Figure 1a, upregulation of VIM, CSPG2, MCAM, CTGF, FGF9, BMP4
and CPA4 was conﬁrmed in AIM2-expressing cells,
whereas ANXA10, GPR110, CDH1, NRIP, S100A14,
GPR87, HMGCS1 and CK20 were conﬁrmed to be
downregulated (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table 3).
Moreover, increased expression of the ISGs was demonstrated by both, real-time PCR (Figure 1c) and by
immunoblotting (Figure 1d) in AIM2-positive cells.
As transcription of genes encoding MHC class II
antigens HLA-DR-a and -b is known to be tightly
controlled by the CIITA and the essential RFX complex
comprising RFX5, RFXAP and RFXANK (Harton
and Ting, 2000; Krawczyk and Reith, 2006; Satoh et al.,

2004), we were interested in expression of CIITA and its
cofactors in response to AIM2. Although no induction
was detected on the microarrays (data not shown),
real-time PCR revealed a 15- and 20-fold induction of
CIITA transcripts in AIM2-positive cell subclones D1
and B8, respectively, when a primer pair that corresponds to a region shared by all CIITA transcripts
was used (Figure 1e). In contrast, expression of
RFX5, RFXAP and RFXANK was unchanged. This
suggests that CIITA expression might likewise be
regulated by AIM2, thereby triggering induction of
HLA-DR-a and -b.
Induction of ISGs by IFN-g correlates with AIM2
expression in different colon cancer cell lines
On the basis of our observation that AIM2 mediates
upregulation of a subset of ISGs, we assumed that
IFN-g-stimulated expression of these ISGs will also
correlate with AIM2 expression. To determine the
optimal time frame for IFN-g treatment we performed
a time response analysis in HT-29 cells, which revealed
maximum transcript expression of AIM2 and most ISGs
within 24 h of treatment (Supplementary Figure 1A).
HLA-DR-a and HLA-DR-b protein expression could
be detected after 15 h, the level increasing with time
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Figure 2 shows fold induction of AIM2 and ISG transcripts in 10 colorectal cancer
cell lines upon treatment with IFN-g for 48 h versus
untreated cells. Consistent with previous ﬁndings
(Woerner et al., 2007), the absolute AIM2 transcript
level (data not shown) and the magnitude of induction
Oncogene

were very low in Vaco-432, SW48 and Caco-2 cells; no
AIM2 induction was observed in (parental) HCT116
and RKO cells. In fact, expression of the ISGs was
induced by IFN-g only in cell lines where AIM2 was
induced as well, whereas none of the genes was upregulated in AIM2-negative cell lines RKO and HCT116. To
further elucidate whether upregulation of ISGs and
HLA-DR genes is AIM2 dependent and does not result
from a more general unresponsiveness of AIM2-null
cells to IFN-g-signaling, we analyzed IFN-g-induction
of an interferon-inducible gene, IFI16, that is thought to
be independent from AIM2 expression. As shown
in Figure 2 (last panel), IFI16 was clearly induced by
IFN-g to a similar degree in 9 of the 10 cell lines,
including the AIM2-deﬁcient HCT116 cells. In contrast
to these cell lines, IFI16 was strongly expressed in RKO
cells even in the absence of IFN-g (data not shown),
therefore no further induction was detected upon IFN-g
treatment, here. We thus conclude that IFN-g-signaling
is basically intact in AIM2-null cells. This ﬁnding is
in line with our recent study (Woerner et al., 2007)
that revealed IFN-g-responsiveness of AIM2-deﬁcient
HCT116 cells. Taken together, our data further support
the idea that AIM2 may have a role in IFN-g-stimulated
induction of target genes.

including colorectal carcinomas (Matsushita et al., 1996,
2006; Oshita et al., 2006). We therefore focused our
further analysis on the role of AIM2 in regulation of
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB expression. To elucidate
whether AIM2 is compulsory for IFN-g-mediated
induction of MHC class II transcripts, we transiently
knocked down AIM2 in IFN-g-treated HT-29 colorectal
cancer cells by RNA interference (siAIM2-6, siAIM2249 and siAIM2-500) targeting independent sequences
in the AIM2 transcript. The efﬁciency of knockdown
was veriﬁed by real-time RT–PCR, showing that AIM2
expression was reduced by three AIM2-speciﬁc small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to 35%, 25% and 47% of
the original IFN-g-induced expression level (Figure 3a).
Using a mix of the three siRNAs (Mix siAIM2 A),
AIM2 expression was reduced to 19% of the original
IFN-g-induced expression level, whereas nonsense
siRNA and siRNA targeting an unrelated gene (siUnrelated; Figure 3e) did not affect AIM2 expression
(Figure 3a). In the consequence of AIM2 knockdown,
the expression of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB mRNAs
was speciﬁcally decreased (Figures 3b and c), indicating
that AIM2 is indeed required for IFN-g-induced expression of these MHC class II genes. Likewise, IFN-gstimulated CIITA induction was diminished, albeit one
of the siRNAs (siAIM2-249) was ineffective, here
(Figure 3d).
AIM2 can induce HLA-DR expression even
in the absence of IFN-g and CIITA
Considering the upregulation of CIITA in consequence
of persistent AIM2 expression, we assumed that AIM2
indirectly mediates induction of HLA-DR genes via
CIITA. The CIITA gene is controlled by several distinct
promoters, two of which direct constitutive expression
in immune cells, whereas promoter IV mediates IFN-gstimulated expression of a speciﬁc CIITA transcript in
epithelial cells (Muhlethaler-Mottet et al., 1997). Using
transcript-speciﬁc primers we could demonstrate that
induction of CIITA in IFN-g-stimulated HT-29 indeed
results from the CIITA type IV product (CIITA-p4;
Figure 4a). Moreover, IFN-g-stimulated CIITA-p4
expression was speciﬁcally reduced on knockdown of
AIM2 transcripts via RNA interference (Figure 4b),
which points to involvement of AIM2 in CIITA-p4
induction as well. Like it was observed for CIITA
(all transcripts) siAIM2-249 was ineffective, here.
To elucidate whether short-term expression of AIM2
can trigger HLA-DR transcription in the absence of
IFN-g, we used a subclone of HCT116 expressing AIM2
under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter
(HCT116-tetON-AIM2), in which high amounts of

cancer cell lines. For analysis, half of the cells from each cell line
were treated with 200 U/ml IFN-g for 48 h and half of the cells were

real-time PCR anlaysis. Bars represent fold expression of mRNA in

Figure 3 Downregulation of IFN-induced AIM2 expression in HT-29 cells by siRNA results in reduced expression of target genes.
Cells were transfected with siRNAs as indicated. After 24 h, 100 U/ml IFN-g was added for another 48 h. Following RNA extraction
and reverse transcription, expression of AIM2 (a), HLA-DRA (b), HLA-DR-B (c), CIITA (d) and an unrelated gene (e) was determined
by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Gene expression in cells that were treated with IFN-g without addition of siRNA was set
100%. Bars represent the mean and s.d. of three independent experiments. Mix siAIM2 A: pooled siAIM2-6, siAIM2-249, siAIM2500. Mix siAIM2 B: commercially available AIM2 siRNA (h) as described in the Materials and methods section.

AIM2 transcripts and protein are detectable within
6–12 h after addition of doxycycline (Figures 5a and b).
In contrast to the D1 and B8 subclones, which
persistently express low levels of AIM2 and CIITA,
neither CIITA nor CIITA-p4 transcripts were detectable
in HCT116-tetON-AIM2 cells in response to AIM2
expression (Figure 5a and data not shown). However,
HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB transcription increased 2.8
and 5.1-fold, respectively after 24 h (Figure 5a). Furthermore, HLA-DR antigen expression was clearly detectable
after 48 h of doxycycline-treatment and disappeared
when the amount of AIM2 decreased again (Figure 5b).
We next investigated activation of the HLA-DRA
promoter region in response to AIM2 by luciferase
reporter assays in different cell lines. 293T, HCT116 and
HT-29 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase
reporter that is driven by a fragment of the HLA-DRA
promoter region (pDRA-luc) and an expression vector
encoding either EGFP or an EGFP–AIM2 fusion
protein. The activity of the empty vector pGL3-basic
was used for comparison. In AIM2-transfected cells, the
relative activation of the HLA-DRA promoter was 6.1-,
3.1- and 2.6-fold higher compared with EGFP-transfected cells (Figure 6), consistent with the observation
that AIM2 is able to induce HLA-DR. In accordance
to our previous data, the HLA-DRA promoter was
not activated by IFN-g in HCT116 cells, whereas it was
strongly induced in HT-29 and 293T cells. Although the
Oncogene

magnitude of HLA-DR induction without CIITA
participation is lower in AIM2-transfectants than upon
IFN-g induction, the above experiments argue for
a CIITA-independent mechanism of AIM2-mediated
HLA-DR induction.
AIM2 action does not involve STAT-signaling for
induction of target genes, which argues against an
autocrine production of IFNs or other cytokines
As demonstrated by our data, CIITA was induced in
HCT116 subclones D1 and B8 that persistently express
AIM2, but not upon transient AIM2 expression in the
absence of IFN-g. This suggested that persistent AIM2
expression might result in release of factors such as
IFNs and other cytokines into the medium, thereby
activating expression of CIITA and ISGs in an autostimulating manner. We therefore analyzed Janus
kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription
(JAK-STAT)-signaling in the D1 and B8 subclones in
comparison with HT-29 on treatment with IFN-g by
immunoblotting. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated
in response to numerous cytokines via speciﬁc receptors
resulting in a phosphorylation cascade and STAT homo/
hetero dimerization (Aaronson and Horvath, 2002).
STAT phosphorylation thus indicates activation of the
JAK-STAT pathway by the majority of cytokines, including IFNs. As shown in Figure 7a, AIM2 expression did

for an AIM2-mediated mechanism of induction that
proceeds independently from cytokine-mediated induction of ISGs.

not result in phosphorylation of STATs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6
in untreated HCT116 subclones D1 and B8. This
indicates that production and autostimulating mechanisms of cytokines are not involved in AIM2-mediated
activation of CIITA and ISGs. The treatment of the cells
with IFN-g resulted in a transient phosphorylation of
STAT1 and STAT3 in each of the cell lines, HT-29,
HCT116 parental cells and sublcones D1 and B8,
irrespective of AIM2 expression, with a maximum
phosphorylation after 1 h of treatment (Figures 7a and
b). Interestingly, the total amount of STAT1 increased
upon IFN-g treatment in each of the cell lines, reaching
a peak at 24 h, whereas the total amount of STAT3
remained unaffected (Figure 7b). However, again these
effects were independent from AIM2 expression. In
addition, STAT phosphorylation/activation were not
detectable in doxycyclin-inducible HCT116-tetON-

AIM2 does not confer activation of caspase-1 or IL-1b
in colorectal cancer cells
Considering the recently identiﬁed role of AIM2 in
activation of inﬂammasome-mediated cell death in
response to cytoplasmic DNA (Burckstummer et al.,
2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al.,
2009; Roberts et al., 2009), we investigated activation of
caspase-1 and its substrate interleukin 1b (IL-1b) in
response to AIM2 expression in colorectal cancer cells.
Western blot analysis revealed induction of pro-Caspase-1 expression in HT-29 cells, HCT116 parental cells
and AIM2-expressing subclones D1 and B8 upon IFN-g
treatment (Figure 8). In agreement with previous
ﬁndings (Patsos et al., 2010), pro-Caspase-1 was not
detected in untreated colorectal cancer cell lines. No
difference was observed between the pro-Caspase-1
expression level in parental HCT116 cells and AIM2transfected subclones D1 and B8, indicating that this
induction is not caused by AIM2, but rather results
from other IFN-g-mediated mechanisms. Moreover, no
activation of caspase-1, as indicated by emergence of
cleaved IL-1b (p17), was observed, neither in response
to IFN-g nor as a result of AIM2 expression (Figure 8).
In fact, IL-1b precursor was not expressed in any of the
cell lines independent from treatment or AIM2-status.
We therefore conclude that AIM2 function does not

differently in macrophages.

Discussion
The impact of induced AIM2-expression on colorectal
tumors is largely unknown. Using a microarray expression proﬁling approach and subsequent functional
analysis in colorectal cancer cells, we here present an
evidence that AIM2 mediates induction of genes that
were previously shown to be stimulated by IFN-g. The
idea that AIM2 may have a role in IFN-g action was
originally stated by De Young et al. who detected
increased AIM2 mRNA levels in HL-60 promyelocytic
leukemia cells after IFN-g treatment (DeYoung et al.,
1997). Response to IFNs and subsequent expression of
ISGs, in particular expression of class II MHC antigens
(HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) is considered a crucial step
in immune response towards colorectal carcinomas
(Matsushita et al., 1996, 2006; Pﬁzenmaier et al.,
1985). Accordingly, our ﬁnding that AIM2 is involved
in induction of these genes adds important information
to understanding the impact of inﬂammatory cytokines
on tumor cells. Until now, AIM2 has been primarily
identiﬁed to act as a DNA sensor in macrophages that
induces a machinery of defense mechanisms against
cytosolic bacteria and DNA viruses via innate immunity
(Burckstummer et al., 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al.,
2009; Hornung et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2010; Rathinam
et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2009; Tsuchiya et al., 2010).
For the ﬁrst time we present the evidence that AIM2
may likewise have a role in epithelial cells responding to
inﬂammatory processes during tumor progression. Most
Oncogene

notably, we show that AIM2 is required for IFN-gdependent induction of HLA-DR-a and -b on colorectal
cancer cells, thus linking AIM2 function with adaptive
immunity as well.
The relationship between HLA-DR antigen expression on cancer cells and prognosis has been pointed out
repeatedly. Although HLA-DR antigen expression is
barely detectable in normal colorectal epithelium, strong
HLA-DR antigen expression on cancer cells relates to
better prognosis of colorectal cancer patients (Andersen
et al., 1993; Diederichsen et al., 2003; Lovig et al., 2002;
Matsushita et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2009). Consequently, regulation and impairment of HLA class II
antigen expression in colorectal tumors is subject of
intensive investigations (Garrity-Park et al., 2009;
Michel et al., 2010b; Satoh et al., 2004). Constitutive
expression of HLA class II antigens is restricted to
‘professional antigen-presenting cells’, but can be
induced on various tissues by IFN-g. This tissue-speciﬁc
expression pattern is mainly determined by a highly
specialized molecular machinery that involves interaction between ubiquitous DNA-binding transcription
factors and the non-DNA-binding coactivator CIITA.
CIITA comprises three cell-type speciﬁc protein isoforms, depending on which of three alternative promoters is used for transcription (Harton and Ting, 2000). In
epithelial cells, IFN-g activates transcription of CIITA
from promoter p4 through JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Upon interaction with several co-factors, including
the essential RFX complex, CIITA then activates the
HLA class II promoter (Krawczyk and Reith, 2006).
In accordance with this, we could demonstrate the
concerted induction of CIITA and HLA-DRA, and
B transcripts in 8 out of 10 colorectal cancer cell
lines stimulated with IFN-g, whereas neither of these
genes was induced in IFN-g-responsive, AIM2-null

cells. The IFN-g-stimulated induction was signiﬁcantly
decreased when AIM2 was downregulated by RNA
interference. In addition, CIITA and HLA-DR transcription appeared to be induced by AIM2 that was
derived from constitutive overexpression in colorectal
cancer cells in the absence of IFN-g. AIM2 may thus be
considered as a co-factor of CIITA for transcriptional
activation of HLA-DRA and B. It remains to be demonstrated whether AIM2 in cooperation with CIITA
directly activates transcription of HLA class II genes
or rather indirectly by regulating CIITA gene expression, which in turn activates transcription of HLA class
II genes. Our data showing that AIM2 downregulation
results in reduced IFN-g-stimulated CIITA transcription argues for a role of AIM2 in transcription of the

CIITA gene. On the other hand, we demonstrated a
direct induction of HLA-DR-a and -b expression without participation of CIITA, when AIM2 was transiently
induced in HCT116-tetOn-AIM2 cells. Furthermore,
the HLA-DR promoter was activated in AIM2-transfected cells, even in the absence of IFN-g. As the
magnitude of HLA-DR induction without CIITA
participation was much lower than after IFN-g-induction in IFN-g-responsive cells, we assume that full
activation of HLA-DR transcription requires the presence of both, CIITA and AIM2.
Interestingly, CIITA and AIM2 both appear to be
evolutionarily related to a group of receptors for the
recognition of intracellular pathogens. CIITA shares
structural features with the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain family of proteins (Krawczyk and
Reith, 2006), which function as cytosolic sensors for the
induction of apoptosis, as well as for innate recognition
of microorganisms and regulation of inﬂammatory
responses in mammalian cells (Inohara and Nunez,
2003). AIM2 was recently shown to share the functions
of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like
receptors by forming inﬂammasomes, which mediate
caspase-1-activation in response to intracellular pathogens (Brennan and Bowie, 2010). So far it is unknown,
whether CIITA and AIM2 likewise share some functional roles in adaptive immunity, such as activation of
HLA class II-mediated antigen expression and presentation to CD4 þ T cells. Unfortunately, the demonstration
of protein–protein interaction or co-expression of endogenous AIM2 and CIITA is currently hindered by the
lack of experimental tools, such as speciﬁc antibodies
detecting either protein via immunoblots or immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figure 2 and data not
shown).
Regardless of the precise mechanism of HLA-DR
induction mediated by AIM2, our data add to understanding alterations of HLA class II antigen expression
in colorectal tumors. Deﬁciency of HLA class II antigen

expression despite the presence of HLA-class II-inducing factors, such as IFN-g, had previously been reported to occur in about one third of primary MSI-H colorectal carcinomas and in more than half of microsatellite
stable colorectal carcinomas (Lovig et al., 2002; Michel
et al., 2010b). Moreover, reduced or absent IFN-gstimulated induction of HLA class II transcripts and/or
protein had been demonstrated in colorectal cancer cell
lines HCT116, RKO and Caco2 (Michel et al., 2010b;
Satoh et al., 2004), which is in line with our ﬁndings. The
underlying mechanisms of this deﬁciency, however, have
been elucidated only in part. The lack of HLA class II
expression in primary colon tumors has been attributed
to mutations in several regulatory genes, such as RFX5
(26.5 %) and CIITA (2.9%) (Michel et al., 2010b). In
addition, epigenetic silencing of CIITA by promoter VI
methylation was identiﬁed in gastric cancers (Satoh
et al., 2004) and in cell lines HCT116, RKO and Caco2
(Michel et al., 2010b; Satoh et al., 2004). Here, we
present the evidence for an additional mechanism interfering with HLA class II antigen expression in cancer
cells, namely alterations in AIM2 expression. We have
previously shown that AIM2 promoter hypermethylation conferred insensitivity to IFN-g-induced AIM2
expression of some MSI-H colon cancer cell lines.
Complete silencing of the AIM2 promoter region
analyzed was observed in HCT116, whereas considerably reduced AIM2 transcript expression and partial
silencing of the AIM2 promoter was found in SW48,
Vaco432, RKO and Caco2 cells ((Woerner et al., 2007)
and unpublished data). Defects in AIM2 expression, as
conﬁrmed in the present study, may thus contribute to
the low HLA-DRA transcript expression in IFN-gstimulated cells. Immunohistochemical analysis may
help to support these ﬁndings as a mechanism that is
also relevant in primary colorectal cancer tissue, as soon
as speciﬁc AIM2 antibodies will be available.
Our hypothesis that AIM2 has an important role in
cytokine mediated immunomodulation of colorectal
cancer cells was further supported by the observation
that AIM2 mediates induction of a subset of ISGs
in different colorectal cancer cell lines. IFIT1, IFIT2,
IFIT3, IFI6, IRF7, ISG15 and TLR3 transcripts were
upregulated upon constitutive AIM2 expression and/or
in eight colorectal cancer cells lines, in which AIM2 was
induced by IFN-g. The precise mechanism of this gene
induction remains to be elucidated, as we cannot
conclude from our data whether the upregulation is
directly induced by AIM2 or whether it involves intermediate mechanisms, such as participation of CIITA or
other factors. Preliminary analysis of HCT116-tetONAIM2 cells revealed a maximum induction of ISG
expression at 24–48 h after doxycyclin-stimulated expression of AIM2 in the absence of CIITA (data not
shown), thereby correlating with the here reported time
course of HLA-DR expression in these cells.
The physiological signiﬁcance of AIM2-mediated
upregulation of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 is difﬁcult to
evaluate, as the function of these genes is poorly
understood. The IFIT1/ISG56 gene family is known to
be activated in response to interferons, as well as by
Oncogene

a multitude of viruses through involvement of IFNregulatory factors (IRFs), with and without functional
JAK/STAT signaling and IFN-g action (Fensterl and
Sen, 2011). The latter is in good agreement with our
observation that AIM2 was capable to induce ISGs in
the presence or absence of IFN-g and without using
JAK/STAT signaling. The function of IFI6, also known
as G1P3, is likewise largely unknown. It was reported to
be overexpressed in human senescent ﬁbroblasts and to
inhibit mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells
(Cheriyath et al., 2007; Tahara et al., 2005). IRF-7
belongs to a family of interferon regulatory factors,
which interact with IFN-stimulated response elements in
promoters of IFN-responsive target genes (reviewed in
(Zhang and Pagano, 2002)). Among these target genes,
there are many additional members of the IFNA gene
family, encoding type I interferons. The IRF7 gene has
previously been shown to be activated from a basal level
by endogenous or exogenous IFN-a, bacterial lipopoysaccharide and some viruses. In contrast to previous
studies, in which IRF7 gene expression was restricted to
induction by IFN-a/b in lymphoid cell types (Marie
et al., 1998), we clearly demonstrated IRF7 upregulation
in colorectal cancer cells in response to IFN-g and AIM2
expression, and may thus expand IRF-7 function to
cancer cells. ISG15 is known as one of the earliest ISGs
induced by type I INFs. The encoded ISG15 protein is
an ubiquitin-like protein that targets many components
of the antiviral innate immune response (reviewed in
(Pitha-Rowe and Pitha, 2007)). Recently, ISG15 conjugation was shown to be involved in ubiquitination of
b-catenin, thereby suppressing Wnt/b-catenin signaling
activity, the ‘driving force’ of tumorigenesis in colorectal
cancer tissues (Lee et al., 2010). In addition to being a
post-translational protein modiﬁer, ISG15 is also a
cytokine that is secreted from immune cells and epithelial
cancer cell lines and was shown to activate monocytederived dendritic cells and cytolytic activity of NK cells
(D’Cunha et al., 1996a, 1996b). Finally, TLR3 encoding
toll-like receptor 3, serves as an important signaling
receptor for the recognition of dsRNA for the triggering
of antiviral and inﬂammatory responses to combat viral
infections. Whether these ISG functions are important in
the context of AIM2 expression in cancer cells remains to
be investigated.
In conclusion, our data place AIM2 in a signaling
cascade, mediating the biological effects of interferons
that result in expression of immunomodulating target
genes. Although the AIM2-regulated ISGs and AIM2
itself were previously associated with innate immune
response to pathogens, our ﬁndings suggest a novel
role of the IFN-AIM2-ISG-machinery in cancer cells.
Our data provide a functional evidence that AIM2 is
required for induction of some ISGs, as well as HLADRA, HLA-DRB and the master regulator CIITA in
colorectal tumor cells. In contrast to macrophages,
AIM2 action appears to not involve Caspase-1 or IL-1b
activities, here. Further in vivo and in situ studies will
help to understand the biological signiﬁcance of these
interactions for the susceptibility of tumor cells towards
anti-tumoral immune response.

Materials and methods
Cell lines and culture conditions
Colorectal cancer cell lines LoVo, KM12, HCT116, SW48,
LS174T, LS180, RKO, Vaco-432, Caco-2 and HT-29 have
been described previously (Woerner et al., 2001, 2007).
Construction of HCT116-tet-AIM2 (subclones D1 and B8)
and HCT116tTA-Hyg (subclone D3) has been described in
(Patsos et al., 2010). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin using standard conditions. INF-g was added as
indicated in the ﬁgures.
RNA extraction, Affymetrix microarray analysis, cDNA
synthesis and real-time PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from the indicated cell lines using
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples of two
independent HCT116-tet-AIM2 subclones (D1 and B8) and
Mock-transfected, AIM2-deﬁcient HCT116-tTA-hyg cells
(subclone D3) were subjected to oligonucleotide microarray
analysis using GeneChip HG-U133 Plus 2.0 (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Raw data obtained from microarray were reported
to GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), sample number
GSE24155. Microarray data were annotated using a Unigene
based customer CDF-ﬁle (http://brainarray.mbni.med.umich.
edu/Brainarray/Database/CustomCDF7CDF_download.aspand,
version 10) and raw signals were quantile normalized. A mixed
model of ANOVA for differential gene expression was performed
with the JMP genomics (SAS) software (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).
For cDNA synthesis, 1–2 mg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed using oligo-dT primers and SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Karlsruhe,
Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. PowerSYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany) was added to appropriate cDNA samples and
primers (Supplementary Table 1). Samples were loaded onto
96-well PCR plates and analyzed in an ABI Prism 7300
thermo-cycler (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany)
with the following cycling program: 95 1C for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles of 95 1C for 15 s and 60 1C for 60 s. Quantitative
analysis of gene expression was performed relative to expression of 18 s RNA in corresponding samples by using individual standard ampliﬁcation curves of each transcript. For
undetectable levels of transcripts, we used a baseline of
40 cycles for calculation.
Western blotting
Cells were harvested on ice in cell lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-PO4
pH 8,0; 2 mM DTT; 2 mM CDTA; 10% Glycerin; 1%
Triton-X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Complete EDTA-free, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and
1 mM Na3VO4. Cell lysis was performed by two freeze-thaw
cycles. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of cell lysates were
separated on a 10–12.5% SDS–polyacrylamide gel and blotted
on nitrocellulose by semi-dry electroblotting. Equal loading
was veriﬁed by staining with Ponceau S solution, and blots
were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline,
0.1% Tween-20 (TBST); 5% non-fat dry milk) before primary
antibodies were added in blocking buffer (containing 5% nonfat milk for mouse antibodies and 5% BSA for rabbitantibodies) for overnight incubation at 4 1C. After four times
washing in TBST, appropriate peroxidise-coupled secondary
goat or rabbit antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were
added in blocking buffer for one hour. After six times washing

in TBST, signals were detected by chemoluminescence (Western
Lightning Plus ECL, PerkinElmer LAS, Rodgau, Germany).

Anti-FLAG (mouse monoclonal, clone M2, Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany); Anti-AIM2 (puriﬁed MaxPAb polyclonal antibody B01P, Abnova, Biozol, Eching, Germany),
dilution 1:500. This antibody can detect overexpressed AIM2
but not endogenous AIM2 ((Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009)
and our own unpublished observations). Anti-IFIT1 (mouse
polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), dilution 1:1000; AntiIFIT2 (MaxPab mouse polyclonal antibody, Abnova, Biozol

Department of Microbiology and Immunology, New York
Medical College, NY, USA (Temponi et al., 1993). The
Phospho-Stat Antibody sampler kit (Cell Signaling Technology,
NEB, Frankfurt, Germany) was used for detection of Phospho
Stat1 (Tyr701), Phospho Stat2 (Tyr690), Phospho Stat3
(Tyr705), Phospho Stat3 (ser727), Phospho Stat5 (Tyr694)
and Phospho Stat6 (Tyr641) as recommended by the manufacturer. Anti-STAT1, anti-STAT3 and anti-IL-1b, dilution
1:1000, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, NEB,
Frankfurt, Germany; Anti-caspase-1, dilution 1:500, was
derived from Merck Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany).
RNA interference
HT-29 cells were plated at 1.5  105 cells in 24-well plates and
immediately transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting AIM2
as indicated in the ﬁgures at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 nM
using 9 ml/well HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden
Germany). siRNAs were (sense strand) siAIM2-6: 50 -CCCG
AAGAUCAACACGCUUCA-30 , siAIM2-249: 50 -GAGAGU
AAAUACAAGGAGA-30 , si-AIM2-500: 50 -GGAGAAAGU
UGAUAAGCAA-30 . AllStars Negative Control (‘nonsense’)
siRNA was derived from Qiagen, Hilden Germany; AIM2
siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany),
AIM2 siRNA (h), representing a pool of three target-speciﬁc
19–25 nt siRNA duplexes (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany) was used as a positive control. In addition, siRNA
targeting an irrelevant gene (‘siUnrelated’) was used for control.
After 24-h transfection, cells were stimulated for 48 h with
100 U/ml IFN-g.
Generation of HCT11-tetON-AIM2 cells
A multistep cloning strategy was pursued to generate a
doxycycline-inducible ﬂag-tagged AIM2 expression construct
(pTRE-Tight-BI-DsRedExpress-FH-AIM2(wt)). The AIM2
cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers that harbor NheI
or NotI restriction sites (sense primer AIM2-NheI: 50 -CCCC
CGCTAGCATGGAGAGTAAATACAAGGAGAT-30 ; antisense primer AIM2-NotI: 50 -CCCCCGCGGCCGCGAGAG
GAGCCTGTGAACTGC-30 ). The NheI/NotI digested AIM2
cDNA amplicon was subsequently cloned into NheI/NotI
digested plasmid pFH-IRESneo (Robert Roeder, The Rockefeller
University, New York, NY, USA), thereby generating plasmid
pFH-AIM2-IRESneo that contains the Flag-HA-AIM2 expression cassette. Bacterial clones that harbor recombinant plasmids
were identiﬁed by colony PCR and sequence analysis of the
expression cassette. After KpnI/NotI digestion of pFH-AIM2IRESneo, the 1257 bp Flag-HA-AIM2 expression cassette was
cloned into KpnI/NotI digested pTRE-Tight-BI-DsRed-Express
plasmid (Takara Bio Europe/Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
France). Recombinant bacterial clones were identiﬁed by colony

PCR and sequencing across the insert cloning sites. For
construction of double-stable cell lines inducibly expressing the
above construct, the Tet-On colorectal cancer cell line HCT116AWE17 (Welman et al., 2005) was used as a background. 107
cells were transfected with 10 mg of pTRE-Tight-BI-DsRed-FHAIM2 expression plasmid using electroporation (AMXA Nucleofector I, solution V). Cells were seeded onto 10-cm dishes
and subjected to G418 selection (PAA Laboratories, 600 mg/ml)
for 3 weeks. Single-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution
of pooled G418-resistant clones from each plate. Double stable
DsRed-positive clones were identiﬁed upon doxycycline induction (1 mg/ml; 24 h) by ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Analysis of HLA-DRA promoter activity by luciferase reporter
assays
Cells were grown at a density of 2  105 cells in 24-well plates
for 24 h. For reporter assays, cells were transfected with equal
amounts (300 ng/well) of pGL3-basic or pDRA-luc, respectively, using Fugene HD transfection reagent (ROCHE
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pDRA-luc containing a 6.1 kb fragment
of the HLA-DRA-promoter region driving a luciferase gene
(Osborne et al., 2001), was kindly provided by George Blanck,
University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA. Expression
plasmids encoding EGFP or EGFP-AIM2, respectively, (Patsos
et al., 2010) were added as indicated in the ﬁgures. For normali-

zation of transfection efﬁciency, 60 ng of a beta-galctosidaseencoding reporter (pRSV-lacZ) was included in each sample.
Non-coding DNA was used to ﬁll all transfection samples to a
total of 600 ng per well. 100 U/ml of IFN-g was added as
indicated in the ﬁgures. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h,
lysed and collected for reporter assays as described previously
(Dihlmann et al., 1999) with the following modiﬁcation: for betagalactosidase reporter assays, 15 ml of each lysate was added to
100 ml of assay buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM
KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM EDTA and 3 ml/ml beta-Mercaptoethanol) and 25 ml of Chlorophenol Red-b-D-galactoside
(CPRG, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) Colorimetric
detection was performed at 570 nm using a photometer. For
comparison of promoter activity, basic induction of pGL3-Basic
was used as a reference and set as 1.0.
