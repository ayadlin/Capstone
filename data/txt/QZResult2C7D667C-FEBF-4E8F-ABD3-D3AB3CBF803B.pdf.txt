Asparaginases are a cornerstone of treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are used for
remission induction and intensification treatment in all pediatric regimens and in the majority of adult treatment protocols. Extensive clinical data have shown that intensive asparaginase treatment improves clinical outcomes in
childhood ALL. Three asparaginase preparations are available: the native asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli
(E. coli asparaginase), a pegylated form of this enzyme (PEG-asparaginase), and a product isolated from Erwinia
chrysanthemi, ie, Erwinia asparaginase. Clinical hypersensitivity reactions and silent inactivation due to antibodies
against E. coli asparaginase, lead to inactivation of E. coli asparaginase in up to 60% of cases. Current treatment protocols include E. coli asparaginase or PEG-asparaginase for first-line treatment of ALL. Typically, patients exhibiting
sensitivity to one formulation of asparaginase are switched to another to ensure they receive the most efficacious
treatment regimen possible. Erwinia asparaginase is used as a second- or third-line treatment in European and US
protocols. Despite the universal inclusion of asparaginase in such treatment protocols, debate on the optimal formulation and dosage of these agents continues. This article provides an overview of available evidence for optimal use

The long-term outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved dramatically during the last few decades
because of the development of effective treatments and well-designed treatment protocols. Long-term, event-free, survival
rates in children are currently around 80%,1-6 and overall survival rates are close to or exceeding 90%.4 Although overall
survival rates in adults have improved in recent years, only 38% to 50% achieve long-term survival.7,8 Compared with
adult ALL patients, who have a poorer tolerance to some chemotherapy regimens,9-11 childhood ALL patients achieve a
superior outcome, attributed to a higher proportion of favorable genetic subtypes, more effective treatment options, and
better compliance with treatment by patients, parents, and physicians. Although the majority of recent regimens for adult
ALL patients are based on pediatric treatment schedules, there is room for further treatment refinement in these
patients.9,10,12-17
Among the drugs used in the treatment of ALL are bacteria-derived enzymes, referred to as asparaginases.6,18 Three
main types of asparaginase have been used so far: 1) native asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli asparaginase:

Gaithersburg, MD),19 and 3) an enzyme isolated from
Erwinia chrysanthemi, referred to as Erwinia asparaginase
(Erwinase, EUSA Pharma, Oxford, UK).18 It is important
to note that some of these preparations are no longer available in all countries. A fourth, new, recombinant E. coli
asparaginase preparation is currently undergoing clinical
evaluation; it is engineered to have an amino acid sequence
identical to that of Asparaginase Medac, with initial data
showing a efficacy and toxicity profile comparable to those
of the other E. coli-asparaginases.20 An asparaginase encapsulated into homologous red blood cells has recently been
proposed as a new approach to maintain enzyme activity,
while reducing formation of antiasparaginase antibodies.21
In addition, a pegylated form of recombinant Erwinia
asparaginase is under preclinical study.22
The parenteral administration of asparaginase results
in rapid and complete deamination of the amino acid
asparagine and, to a lesser extent, glutamine,23-26 leading
to depletion of asparagine, especially in the plasma23,27-31
and, in part, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).32,33 Differences in biological activity among available E. coli asparaginase preparations have been suggested.32 The tolerated
dose has varied among trials,4,25,34 which is also suggestive
of differences in the relative potency of the available
asparaginase products.
Despite its use as an essential drug used in all treatment protocols for ALL, asparaginase’s optimal formulation and dosage are still being debated. We provide an
overview of available data on the use of asparaginases with
a focus on Erwinia asparaginase, which has been less well
studied compared with other forms.

ASPARAGINASE THERAPY IN ALL
Efficacy Data for Asparaginases
Extensive clinical data support the use of asparaginase
therapy in pediatric ALL,2,4,6,35-38 and the benefit of
intensive asparaginase treatment compared with less
intensive regimens has been demonstrated (Fig. 1).2,38-41
In a study conducted by the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute
(DFCI) ALL Consortium and designed to improve
outcomes and minimize toxicities in pediatric patients
with standard-risk or high-risk ALL, 377 children were
enrolled to receive a high-dose native E. coli asparaginase
(25 000 IU/m2 weekly) or PEG-asparaginase (2 500 IU/
m2 every other week) for 30 weeks during intensification
therapy. The estimated 5-year, event-free survival rate was
significantly higher than that of a previously conducted
DFCI ALL Consortium study (83%  2% vs 74% 

3%; P < .01), a finding that was attributed to the prolonged asparaginase intensification.2 In addition, in this
study, children who tolerated more than 25 weekly doses
of asparaginase had a better event-free survival than those
who received 25 or fewer doses.2 Furthermore, a randomized study carried out by the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) determined the
efficacy of a BFM-type modified chemotherapy regimen
with or without prolonged use of high-dose native E. coli
asparaginase (25 000 IU/m2 weekly for 20 weeks) during
continuation therapy in 355 children with standard-risk
ALL.41 Children given asparaginase had a significantly
increased 10-year disease-free survival (87.5% vs 78.7%)
and an overall survival (93.7% vs 88.6%), with a 40%
reduction in the relative risk of failure compared with
patients who were not treated with asparaginase.41 This
finding supports previous data from Amylon et al38 showing that high-dose native E. coli asparaginase (25 000 IU/
m2 weekly for 20 weeks) during consolidation significantly improved complete continuous remission in
pediatric patients with T-cell ALL and lymphoblastic
lymphoma compared with patients treated with a lowerdose asparaginase regimen (71.3% vs 57.8%, respectively). The randomized studies conducted by Moghrabi
et al40 and Duval et al39 made clear that asparaginase
preparations with a shorter half-life result in a poorer

event-free survival, albeit less toxicity, compared with the
use of asparaginase preparation with a longer half-life
given at the same dose and frequency (Fig. 1). It is also
noteworthy that in a study carried out by Rizzari et al,42
no significant difference in disease-free survival was
observed between patients who received standard treatment (10 000 IU/m2 asparaginase for 4 doses during
reinduction) and those who received high-dose treatment
(25 000 IU/m2 asparaginase weekly for 20 weeks during
reinduction and early continuation).
As a result of these trials, asparaginases are now a
universal component of ALL therapy and are used for
remission induction and intensification treatment in every
pediatric regimen for ALL. However, much debate
remains regarding the optimal formulation and dosage of
asparaginase in the treatment of ALL. Therapy aims to
achieve serum asparagine depletion, but no crucial minimum value for efficacy has yet been established.24,25,43 A
serum level of asparaginase >100 IU/L corresponds to
depletion of asparagine (ie, below the level of quantification)27 and, therefore, is often considered the target
trough asparaginase level; complete asparagine depletion
is observed less frequently with enzyme concentrations
below this level.43,44 However, there is some evidence to
suggest that trough asparaginase levels of below 50 IU/L
can also result in serum and CSF asparagine depletion.44
Toxicity of Asparaginases: Hypersensitivity
Asparaginases are associated with a unique set of side
effects. Hypersensitivity reactions, due to antiasparaginase

240

antibody production, have been observed in up to 60% of
patients at some time during E. coli asparaginase
therapy.45 The development of these antibodies appears
to be more commonly observed with native E. coli asparaginase28,46,47 compared with the pegylated enzyme.28,48
(Table 1) Symptoms of clinical hypersensitivity include
anaphylaxis, pain, edema, Quincke edema, urticaria,
erythema, rash, and pruritis.46 The route of administration determines the clinical symptoms with a greater
incidence of major skin reactions observed with intramuscular (IM) administration compared with intravenous
(IV) administration.52 Clinical hypersensitivity occurs
almost exclusively in postinduction regimens (ie, intensification, reinduction)50,53 when asparaginase has not been
given for weeks or months. There are several possible
explanations for the rarity of allergic reactions during
remission induction. For example, there is a delay in an
effective immune response due to the time taken for complement activation and the subsequent production of antibodies,18 the symptoms associated with allergy might be
masked by intensive corticosteroids treatment that occurs
during induction,18 and the frequency of dosing during
induction may have a desensitizing effect, as allergic
reactions are rarely observed in this phase despite measurable antibody production. Some studies have shown that
the incidence of hypersensitivity to asparaginase is similar
between age groups,2,54 although others have suggested
that infants and younger patients develop antibody and
hypersensitivity reactions less frequently than teenagers
and adult patients.18

Antibodies produced in response to asparaginases
do not always lead to clinical hypersensitivity but may
instead cause rapid inactivation of the asparaginase, resulting in suboptimal asparagine depletion. This is commonly
referred to as ‘‘silent hypersensitivity’’ or ‘‘silent inactivation’’45,55,56 and may occur in approximately 30% of
the patients.45 Development of antiasparaginase antibodies can, thus, confer resistance to asparaginase therapy
and is associated with higher plasma levels of asparagine57
and reduced therapeutic efficacy in some,55,58 but not
all, studies.46,47 This inconsistency of antiasparaginase
antibodies as a prognostic indicator may be explained by
the efficacy of the overall treatment regimens and the use
of alternative asparaginase preparations after allergic
reactions, which may mitigate the adverse effects of silent
hypersensitivity.
Typically, patients exhibiting clinical allergy symptoms to one formulation of asparaginase are switched to
another product to ensure they receive the most efficacious treatment regimen possible.45,56 However, because
patients with silent hypersensitivity lack clinical symptoms and routine antibody monitoring is often not implemented, asparaginase switching does not usually occur in
this setting.45 PEG-asparaginase has a relatively lower
immunogenicity due to the covalent conjugation to
monomethoxy polyethylene glycol59 and often replaces
E. coli asparaginase in patients who develop allergic
reaction. This switch may not be optimal because antibodies against E. coli asparaginase can cross-react with
PEG-asparaginase.49,60 Moreover, PEG-asparaginase may
also induce silent inactivation56 with antibodies, resulting
in a fast decline in asparaginase activity.61 Switching from
PEG-asparaginase after an allergic reaction to E. coli asparaginase is not considered a viable treatment option.62
Other Toxicities Associated
With Asparaginases
Pancreatitis occurs in 4% to 18% of pediatric patients,
depending upon the definition used in the study, and can
cause significant morbidity.54,63,64 Adolescents appear to
be at higher risk for developing this condition than
younger children.54 Pancreatitis tends to occur after the
first few weeks of asparaginase, suggesting a predisposition
to this complication rather than a cumulative drug
effect.64 Retreatment with asparaginase after an episode of
pancreatitis is associated with a high risk of recurrence,64
and so further doses of asparaginase are often omitted,
which may negatively impact event-free survival.2 Other
asparaginase-related toxicities include abnormalities of

Cancer

hemostasis (including central nervous system [CNS]
thromboses and hemorrhage, and peripheral deep venous
thromboses in 2% to 4% of patients), hyperglycemia, and
abnormalities of lipid metabolism.59,65 As with pancreatitis, thrombotic complications are more common in
adolescents and adults than in younger children.54 In
adult patients, liver toxicity with elevated liver enzymes or
increased bilirubin is a frequent clinical problem.8

ERWINIA ASPARAGINASE IN ALL
Currently, there are no widely accepted guidelines for the
use of asparaginases, especially Erwinia asparaginase.
Several comparative studies have been conducted with
Erwinia asparaginase and native E. coli preparations;
the dose and schedules of asparaginase in these studies
have been inconsistent, and outcomes have been
variable.39,40,66,67 However, the efficacy of Erwinia
asparaginase after hypersensitivity to E. coli asparaginase
preparations has been demonstrated.45,68 The differences
in these results highlight the need for recommendations to
provide guidance for the optimal use of Erwinia asparaginase in the treatment of ALL.
Efficacy Data for Erwinia Asparaginase
Eden et al66 carried out a nonrandomized study (UKALL
VIII) comparing the toxicity of IM administration of
Erwinia asparaginase with E. coli asparaginase (6000 IU/
m2 3 times weekly for 3 weeks) in 758 unselected children
with ALL. No apparent difference in event-free survival
was observed after 4.5 years of follow-up, but the incidence of neurotoxicity, pancreatitis, and life-threatening
sepsis was significantly lower in children treated with
Erwinia asparaginase compared with those who received
E. coli asparaginase (neurotoxicity, 2% vs 4%; pancreatitis, 0% vs 2%; sepsis, 18% vs 20%).66 Results from this
early trial led to the first randomized study (European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of CancerChildren’s Leukemia Group [EORTC-CLG] 58881)
comparing Erwinia asparaginase with E. coli asparaginase39 and included 700 children (aged <18 years) with
ALL (93%) or lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(7%). Patients were randomized to receive the same dosage of either asparaginase (10 000 IU/m2 IV twice-weekly
for a total of 8 doses in the induction phase and 4 doses in
the reinduction phase). Significantly more patients
administered Erwinia asparaginase failed to achieve complete remission compared with those who received E. coli
asparaginase (4.9% vs 2%), and the relapse rate was

241

Review Article

higher, resulting in reduced event-free survival. Overall 6year survival was also significantly superior, but coagulopathy was more common in patients administered E. coli
asparaginase compared with the Erwinia asparaginase
group (83.9% vs 75.1%).39
A subsequent randomized study, DFCI-ALL-95-01,
compared administration of Erwinia asparaginase
(25 000 IU/m2 once in induction followed by onceweekly doses for 20 weeks during intensification) with the
same doses of E. coli asparaginase in 286 ALL patients
(aged 0-18 years).40 The 139 children given Erwinia asparaginase had significantly reduced toxicity (10% vs 24%;
P < .01) and fewer allergic reactions (6% vs 14%; P ¼
.03) compared with 147 patients treated with E. coli asparaginase but had significantly lower 5-year event-free
survival (78%  4% vs 89%  3%).40 There were also
significantly more relapses involving the CNS in children
receiving Erwinia asparaginase compared with those
receiving E. coli asparaginase (6% vs 1%).40
Another study by Kwok et al67 compared the efficacy of Erwinia asparaginase and E. coli asparaginase in
116 children with ALL. Erwinia asparaginase was administered at a dose of 10,000 IU/m2 IM and E. coli asparaginase at 7500 to 10,000 IU/m2 IM twice-weekly for
8 doses during remission induction. Patients treated with
Erwinia asparaginase were 6.7 times more likely to have
residual leukemia levels 102 in bone marrow compared
with patients treated with E. coli asparaginase.67
Due to the shorter half-life of Erwinia asparaginase
compared with E. coli-derived preparations,55 a higher
dose and increased frequency of treatment is required to
ensure adequate serum enzyme activity and complete
serum asparagine depletion. It is, therefore, possible that
the inferior outcome of patients treated with Erwinia
asparaginase in these trials (with parallel decreases in
adverse reactions) is a result of insufficient dose and frequency of this preparation.11,40,62,69 Indeed, Boos et al25
reported that only 26% of samples from ALL patients had
complete depletion of asparagine (ie, 0.1 lmol/L) 3
days after administration of Erwinia asparaginase (10,000
IU/m2 at 3-day intervals). In addition, physiological
asparagine levels recovered faster after Erwinia asparaginase than E. coli preparations.25
In one study, Erwinia asparaginase (30,000 IU/m2
IV or IM) was given daily during induction therapy and
twice a week for 2 weeks during reinduction phase. The
trough levels (measured immediately before the next
administration) were below 100 IU/L in approximately
two-thirds of samples during reinduction.43 Conse-

242

quently, the majority of patients failed to achieve
complete depletion of asparagine during reinduction.
Similarly, in a DFCI ALL Consortium trial, in which
patients switched to Erwinia asparaginase (25,000 IU/m2
twice-weekly) after allergy to E. coli asparaginase, 83% of
patients had serum enzyme activity levels at or above
100 IU/L 3 days after administration, but only 42% of
patients maintained that level 4 days postdosing.68 These
data highlight that even with relatively high Erwinia asparaginase doses (25,000-30,000 IU/m2), a twice-weekly
regimen was still associated with inadequate enzyme levels
in most patients.43,68 Despite these findings, treatment
with twice-weekly Erwinia asparaginase after E. coli
asparaginase allergy did not adversely impact rates of
event-free survival in the DFCI ALL Consortium trial.68
Evidence from Viera Pinheiro et al26 suggests
increased dosing frequency enhances Erwinia asparaginase
activity. In this study, patients with ALL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were administered Erwinia asparaginase
(20 000 IU/m2 3-times weekly) and trough asparagine
levels and asparaginase activity were assessed 2 and 3 days
after therapy.26 Mean serum asparaginase trough levels
were above the target level of 100 IU/L 2 days after
administration of Erwinia asparaginase (mean asparaginase level, 156 IU/L), although the activity fell after 3
days (mean asparaginase activity, 50 IU/L). Finally, Erwinia asparaginase administered at 10,000 U/m2 IV every
second day resulted in a median trough activity of 115 U/
L 2 days after administration, but asparaginase activities
were below 100 U/L in 45% of samples.70 Taken
together, these data show that even a regimen of 3-times
weekly dosing (with a 2-day interval at weekends) yields
inadequate asparaginase trough activity for at least part of
the treatment schedule (typically at the weekend). In this
regard, all the comparative studies in which Erwinia
asparaginase yielded ‘‘inferior’’ outcomes included less
frequent and/or lower absolute doses than those used by
Viera Pinheiro et al,26 and, therefore, serum asparagine
levels may not have been sufficiently depleted.
Second-Line Treatment With
Erwinia Asparaginase
Despite the apparently inferior outcomes of comparative
studies of Erwinia asparaginase with E. coli-derived preparations, a study of 1001 high-risk pediatric ALL patients
treated with 9 doses of native E. coli asparaginase during
induction (6000 IU/m2 3-times weekly for 3 weeks)
demonstrated the efficacy of switching products after clinical hypersensitivity.45 Results from an interim analysis

Cancer

January 15, 2011

L-Asparaginase Treatment in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Pieters et al

of 280 patients, who were evaluated for at least 30 months
after induction, showed that 41% developed clinical allergic reactions with positive antibody formation and were
switched to Erwinia asparaginase. The antibody-positive
patients with allergic symptoms were switched to Erwinia
asparaginase, resulting in a reduction in their hazard ratio
for treatment failure from 3.2 to 0.6. In contrast, 29% of
patients had silent hypersensitivity and continued to
receive E. coli asparaginase; these children had poorer
outcomes.45 This demonstrates that awareness of the presence of asparaginase antibodies (in the absence of allergy)
and subsequent switching to Erwinia asparaginase might
mitigate the adverse effects of silent hypersensitivity.
Studies have shown cross-reactivity between patients’
antibodies against E. coli asparaginase and PEG-asparaginase, but not between those against E. coli asparaginase and
Erwinia asparaginase.49,60 Moreover, asparagine concentrations were less depleted by PEG-asparaginase than by Erwinia asparaginase in a small study of patients with antibodies
against E. coli asparaginase.57 Interestingly, one study
showed that patients may also develop antibodies to the
nonprotein PEG moiety of PEG-asparaginase.71 This was
associated with rapid clearance of PEG-asparaginase in a
subgroup of pediatric patients who otherwise did not present a clinical manifestation of hypersensitivity or allergy.
Furthermore, a population pharmacokinetic model demonstrated a fast decline in asparaginase activity in a group of
patients, most likely related to the development of antibodies against PEG-asparaginase.61 It has, therefore, been
suggested that anti-PEG level monitoring/screening or asparaginase activity measurements could allow for modification in PEG-asparaginase dosing or the use of an alternative
asparaginase.61,71 So far, the presence of anti-PEG antibodies has not been confirmed by others. Routine antibody
assessment or measurement of asparaginase levels has been
proposed to predict future allergic reaction or to alert physicians to the possibility of silent hypersensitivity.18,26,46
As yet, there are no data from large well-designed
studies to demonstrate a preference for Erwinia asparaginase over PEG-asparaginase in patients developing
hypersensitivity to E. coli asparaginase, and there is no
consensus opinion on this. After allergic reactions to
E. coli preparations, substitution with an alternative asparaginase should be based on drug monitoring.25 Erwinia
asparaginase appears to be well tolerated in children with
previous allergy to E. coli asparaginase.68 Allergic reactions
to Erwinia asparaginase have also been reported in up to
33% of patients switching to Erwinia asparaginase after
clinical hypersensitivity to native E. coli asparaginase.68,72

CURRENT STATUS OF AND
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE
USE OF ERWINIA ASPARAGINASE
Both E. coli asparaginase and PEG-asparaginase can be
used as first-line treatment in pediatric ALL protocols,
depending upon country. Before a temporary interruption in 2002 that resulted from manufacturing issues
related to vial stoppers, Erwinia asparaginase was considered the best alternative in cases of clinical hypersensitivity
to these enzymes.62 Erwinia asparaginase production was
reinstated in 2006, and previous European licenses are
planned for reinstatement, together with a process of
mutual recognition in other European countries and full
approval in the United States.
Which Patients Should Receive
Erwinia Asparaginase?
Patients developing allergic reactions to a particular
asparaginase should be switched to an alternative product,
to ensure maximum clinical benefit in terms of survival.
Second-line asparaginase therapy should be dictated by
protocols or regulatory and availability factors, and the
type of asparaginase used in front-line therapy; some
protocols advise Erwinia asparaginase as a preferable
preparation after allergic reaction to native E. coli asparaginase, whereas others prescribe PEG-asparaginase as
replacement for native E. coli asparaginase and Erwinia
asparaginase as third-line drugs.
Several clinical trial groups in Europe and the
United States allow the use of Erwinia asparaginase as a
second-line agent (eg, Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology [NOPHO], German Multicenter
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group [GMALL],
EORTC-58951, French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
group [FRALLE], Children’s Oncology Group [COG]),
DFCI ALL Consortium and, for others, as a third-line
treatment (AIEOP, ALL-BFM-2000, Dutch Childhood
Oncology Group [DCOG-ALL-10], Czech Republic
protocols). Selection of the individual asparaginase is
determined by availability, treatment protocol, and treatment status of the patients (ie, asparaginase-naive or
relapsed), and various Erwinia asparaginase dosing regimens are in use (Table 2; Table 3).
Recommendations

•

Erwinia asparaginase should be used for the second- or
third-line treatment of ALL, depending upon regulatory
requirements, in patients developing hypersensitivity to
E. coli asparaginase preparations.

Erwinia asparaginase should be prescribed when switching from PEG-asparaginase is required (ie, second-line
use of native E. coli asparaginase is not justified).

on the backbone of combination chemotherapy that is
given.
Recommendations

Erwinia Asparaginase Dosing and Schedule
Due to the short half-life of Erwinia asparaginase,55 a
higher dose and increased dosing frequency are required
to ensure optimal asparagine depletion. Current evidence
suggests that Erwinia asparaginase should be administered
at dosages of at least 20,000 IU/m2 3-times weekly, ie, every second day with a 3-day interval at the weekend.26
Twice-weekly dosing at higher doses (25,000-30,000 IU/
m2) has been associated with suboptimal trough serum
enzyme activity but not consistently with inferior eventfree survival,43,68 and, as a result, this dosing regimen is
still used by some groups.
As Erwinia asparaginase requires frequent dosing to
maintain asparagine depletion, therapeutic drug monitoring data (specifically for serum asparaginase levels) could
assist in determining whether increasing the interval
between doses is possible and could, therefore, help to
minimize inconvenience to both patients and physicians.
Furthermore, the development of pegylated Erwinia asparaginase with a longer half-life would make the dosing
schedule more convenient for patients.
Recommendations

•

Erwinia asparaginase should be administered at dosages
of at least 20,000 IU/m2 multiple times per week (eg,
3 times weekly).

Duration of Treatment
The optimal duration of Erwinia asparaginase treatment
has yet to be established, although it has been suggested
that prolonged intensification results in improved survival. This was demonstrated in a study by Silverman
et al,2 where the 5-year, event-free, survival rate of patients
who received at least 26 weeks of asparaginase therapy was
significantly better than those who tolerated 25 weeks or
fewer of therapy (90% vs 73%). This study, together with
the studies presented above and summarized in Figure 1,
suggests that prolonged and intensified therapy with
asparaginase improves outcome of children with ALL.
When Erwinia asparaginase is used as second-line
treatment to replace native E. coli asparaginase or PEGasparaginase, the duration of treatment depends on the
protocol and the yielded duration of asparagine depletion.
Also, the duration of asparaginase treatment will depend

Use prolonged intensification with asparaginase to
optimize survival benefits.

Route of Administration of
Erwinia Asparaginase
Intravenous (IV) administration results in higher peak
plasma concentrations, whereas IM administration results
in a concurrent slower increase of asparaginase activity
due to the depot effect. Accordingly, administration of
10,000 U/m2 Erwinia asparaginase applied every second
day results in median trough activities of 115 U/L (determined from 58 samples of 15 patients) when applied
intravenously and of 151 U/L (determined from 39 samples of 14 patients) when applied intramuscularly. After
IM administration, only 15% of analyzed samples showed
asparaginase activities below the desired activity of 100 U/
L, whereas 45% of samples were below 100 U/L when
Erwinia asparaginase was administered intravenously.70
However, Rizzari et al44 found no significant differences in mean enzyme activity or frequency of samples
showing complete asparagine depletion after IV or IM
administration of Erwinia asparaginase 10,000 IU/m2
every 3 days (8 doses) administered in the induction
phase.44 Similarly, Albertsen et al43 found comparable
complete asparagine depletion in patients given a more
intense regimen of IV or IM administration at 30,000 IU/
m2 daily for 10 days in the induction phase.43 In this
study, however, Erwinia asparaginase administered by the
IM route produced trough asparaginase plasma levels
significantly lower (by approximately 28%) than IV
administration. During the subsequent reinduction phase
(30,000 IU/m2 twice-weekly for 2 weeks), no differences
were observed between the 2 routes in terms of trough
asparaginase activities or in the proportion of patients
who failed to achieve complete asparagine depletion.43
Finally, no significant differences have been observed
between 2 routes of administration of Erwinia asparaginase 30,000 IU/m2 twice-weekly for 2 weeks as a reinduction regimen in terms of neutralizing asparaginase
antibody formation.50
The results of studies investigating the optimal
route for the administration of asparaginase are inconsistent and, therefore, further studies are required to determine whether IV or IM administration of Erwinia

asparaginase is associated with any meaningful clinical
differences.24

ity because not all antibodies lead to asparaginase
inactivation.

No recommendations are made for the route of administration as more data are required to define the optimal
route. However, most groups in Europe currently use IV
asparaginases, whereas North American groups more often administer this agent by intramuscularly.

Monitoring of Asparaginase Trough Levels
and/or Depletion of Asparagine
Initially, the US Food and Drug Administration required
that asparagine levels be used as the primary outcome
measure in clinical trials. Asparaginase therapy aims to
achieve serum asparagine depletion, but no critical minimal value for efficacy has yet been established,24,25,43 and
asparagine levels are difficult to measure accurately when
asparaginase is present in blood because the enzyme can
continue to breakdown asparagine ex vivo if the sample is
not immediately processed and stored on ice. Therefore,
monitoring of asparaginase levels is more reliable than
measurement of asparagine itself. A serum level of asparaginase >100 IU/L, and possibly >50 IU/L, corresponds
to depletion of asparagine (ie, below the level of quantification)44,73; complete asparagine depletion is observed
less frequently with enzyme concentrations below this
level.43,44 However, clinical testing to measure asparaginase levels or asparagine depletion is not routinely carried
out, although therapeutic drug monitoring is offered in
Europe to guide therapeutic decisions (Boos et al, personal communication).
Recommendations

•

Because of technical difficulties in measuring serum
asparagine levels, monitoring asparaginase levels is more
reliable and, therefore, recommended for adaptation of
asparaginase dosing in individual cases and for trials in
which regulatory authorities ask for pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic endpoints.

Monitoring of Erwinia Asparaginase
Antibody Levels
Although it has been advocated previously to determine
antiasparaginase antibody levels to discover whether alterations in dosing regimen should be used to overcome the
risk of silent hypersensitivity, monitoring of asparaginase
levels should be sufficient to identify silent hypersensitiv-

246

No recommendations are made for monitoring antibody
status.

CONCLUSIONS
Advances in therapies for ALL have led to improved longterm survival rates for pediatric and adult patients. Asparaginases form a cornerstone of ALL treatment protocols
with 3 main preparations for use in treatment protocols:
the native E. coli asparaginase, a pegylated form (PEGasparaginase), and an alternative enzyme isolated from
Erwinia chrysanthemi, referred to as Erwinia asparaginase.
Despite the availability of these agents, much debate
remains on the optimal formulation and dose for the
treatment of pediatric and adult ALL patients. This article
aims to provide recommendations, based on data available
in the literature, to ensure optimal use of Erwinia asparaginase. Patients who receive an asparaginase as first-line
treatment for ALL and develop antiasparaginase antibodies should be switched to another asparaginase preparation
to ensure maximal survival benefit. Monitoring of asparaginase levels is preferable to assess the extent of serum
asparagine depletion and to identify cases of silent inactivation. Erwinia asparaginase is a valid second- or thirdline therapy, depending upon protocols, regulatory factors, and availability. Evidence from published studies
suggests that Erwinia asparaginase should be administered
at a dose of at least 20,000 IU/m2 3-times weekly, by
either the IV or IM route. Further clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of Erwinia asparaginase will help optimize
the use of this agent.
