Abstract
;-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) functions primarily as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature central nervous
system, and GABA/GABA receptors are also present in nonneural tissues, including cancer, but their precise function
in nonneuronal or cancerous cells has thus far been poorly
defined. Through the genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as well
as subsequent reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot
analyses, we identified the overexpression of GABA receptor P
subunit (GABRP) in PDAC cells. We also found the expression of this peripheral type GABAA receptor subunit in few
adult human organs. Knockdown of endogenous GABRP
expression in PDAC cells by small interfering RNA attenuated
PDAC cell growth, suggesting its essential role in PDAC
cell viability. Notably, the addition of GABA into the cell culture medium promoted the proliferation of GABRP-expressing
PDAC cells, but not GABRP-negative cells, and GABAA receptor antagonists inhibited this growth-promoting effect by
GABA. The HEK293 cells constitutively expressing exogenous
GABRP revealed the growth-promoting effect of GABA treatment. Furthermore, GABA treatment in GABRP-positive cells
increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and activated the mitogenactivated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(MAPK/Erk) cascade. Clinical PDAC tissues contained a higher
level of GABA than normal pancreas tissues due to the upregulation of glutamate decarboxylase 1 expression, suggesting their autocrine/paracrine growth-promoting effect in
PDACs. These findings imply that GABA and GABRP could
play important roles in PDAC development and progression,
and that this pathway can be a promising molecular target for
the development of new therapeutic strategies for PDAC.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading
cause of cancer death in the western world and reveals the worst
mortality among common malignancies, with a 5-year survival rate
of only 5% (1, 2). In 2007, it is estimated that 37,170 new cases of
pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed and a roughly equal number of
deaths will be attributed to pancreatic cancer in the United States
(3). The majority of patients with PDAC are diagnosed at an

advanced stage, for which no effective therapy is available at
present. Although surgical resection offers only a little possibility
for cure, 80% to 90% of patients with PDAC who undergo curative
surgery die from their disseminated or metastatic diseases (1, 2).
Recent advances in surgery and chemotherapy including 5fluorouracil or gemcitabine, with or without radiation, could
improve the patients’ quality of life (1, 2), but those treatments have
a very limited effect on the long-term survival of patients with
PDAC due to its extremely aggressive and chemoresistant nature.
Hence, the management of most patients is focused on palliative
measures (1).
To overcome this dismal situation, the development of novel
molecular therapies against good molecular targets is an urgent
issue. Toward this direction, we previously generated detailed
expression profiles of PDAC cells using our genome-wide cDNA
microarrays consisting of f30,000 genes, in combination with laser
microbeam microdissection to enrich populations of cancer cells
as much as possible (4). Among genes that overexpressed in PDAC
cells, here, we focused on one peripheral type g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) receptor subunit, the k subunit (GABRP), as a novel molecular target for this disease. The GABAA receptor is a multisubunit
chloride channel that mediates the fastest inhibitory synaptic
transmission in the mature central nervous system (CNS). It
consists mainly of a, h, and g units; six a subunits, three h subunits, and three g subunits have thus far been reported. Atypical
GABRP can assemble with these known GABAA receptor subunits
and the presence of this subunit may alter the sensitivity of GABAA
receptors to GABA or modulator agents (5). Although GABA primarily functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature
CNS, it can also act as a trophic factor during CNS development to
modulate the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of
neuronal cells (6–8). GABA and GABAA receptors are also present
and function in peripheral tissues other than the CNS, but their
precise function in nonneuronal cells, including cancerous cells, is
poorly defined at present.
In this study, we report GABRP overexpression in PDAC cells and
show that GABA and GABAA receptors associated with GABRP are
involved in promoting cancer cell growth through an increase of
intracellular Ca2+ level and activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) / extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk)
cascade, implicating that the GABA pathway could be a promising molecular target for the development of a novel treatment for
PDAC.

Overexpressing GABRP in Pancreatic Cancer
from Invitrogen. The cell lines KLM-1, SUIT-2, PK-1, PK-45P, PK-59, and
Panc-1 were grown in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich), whereas MIAPaCa-2
and Flp-In-293 cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich), all with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (SigmaAldrich). Cells were maintained at 37jC in an atmosphere of humidified
air with 5% CO2.
Semiquantitative RT-PCR. Purification of PDAC cells and normal
pancreatic ductal epithelial cells from frozen PDAC tissues was described
previously (4). RNA from the purified PDAC cells and normal pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells were subjected to two rounds of RNA amplification
using T7-based in vitro transcription (Epicentre Technologies). Total RNA
from human PDAC cell lines were extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Extracted
RNA were treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostic) and reverse-transcribed
to single-stranded cDNA using oligo(dT) primer with Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). We prepared appropriate dilutions of each
single-stranded cDNA for subsequent PCR amplification by monitoring
tubulin a (TUBA) as a quantitative control. The sets of primer sequences
were 5¶-AAGGATTATGAGGAGGTTGGTGT-3¶ and 5¶-CTTGGGTCTGTAACAAAGCATTC-3¶ for TUBA, 5¶-CTCTCCAAATCCAGCCAGAG-3¶ and 5¶-ATGATTGGCTCATACAACCACA-3¶ for GABRP, 5¶-TGCATTTGTGAGCCAAAGAG-3¶ and 5¶-CCTTAGGTTTCAGCTAAGCGAG-3¶ for glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GAD1), 5¶-ATGGACAAAGAAGGCACAGG-3¶ and 5¶-GTTGGGGGAATGTTGATGTC-3¶ for GAD2. All reactions involved initial denaturation
at 94jC for 2 min followed by 23 cycles ( for TUBA), 28 cycles ( for GABRP),
or 35 cycles ( for GAD1 and GAD2) at 94jC for 30 s, 58jC for 30 s, and 72jC
for 1 min on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems).
Northern blotting analysis. One microgram of poly(A)+ RNAs from
seven PDAC cell lines (KLM-1, PK-59, PK-45P, MIAPaCa-2, Panc-1, PK-1, and
SUIT-2) and six adult normal tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and
pancreas; from BD Bioscience) were blotted onto the membrane. This
Northern blot membrane and human MTN blot membrane (Multiple Tissue
Northern blot; BD Bioscience) were hybridized for 16 h with 32P-labeled
GABRP probe, which was labeled using Mega Label kit (GE Healthcare).
Probe cDNA of GABRP was prepared as a 958-bp PCR product by using
primers 5¶-AAGGACTCTGAGGCTTTATTCCC-3¶ and 5¶-ATGATTGGCTCATACAACCACA-3¶. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were done
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The blots were autoradiographed at 80jC for 10 days.
Small interfering RNA–expressing vectors specific to GABRP and
GAD1. To knock down endogenous GABRP or GAD1 expression in PDAC
cells, we used psiU6BX3.0 vector for the expression of short hairpin RNA
against a target gene as described previously (9). The U6 promoter was
cloned upstream of the gene-specific sequence (19-nt sequence from the
target transcript, separated from the reverse complement of the same
sequence by a short spacer, TTCAAGAGA), with five thymidines as a
termination signal and a neo cassette for selection by Geneticin (SigmaAldrich). The target sequences for GABRP were 5¶-ACCAGCGACAAGTTCAAGT-3¶ (si-pi1), 5¶-GATGGGCAGGATTGTTGAT-3¶ (si-pi2), 5¶-AGGAAGTAGAAGAAGTCAG-3¶ (si-pi3), and 5¶-GAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTC-3¶
(si-EGFP) as a negative control. The target sequences for GAD1 were
5¶-CCTTTGGTTGCATGTCGA-3¶ (si-G1), 5¶-GTTCTGGCTGATGTGGAAA-3¶
(si-G2), 5¶-GGGGACAAGGCCAACTTCT-3¶ (si-G3), and 5¶-GAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTC-3¶ (si-EGFP) as a negative control. Human PDAC cell lines,
PK-45P and KLM-1, were plated onto glass coverslips within 10 cm dishes,
and transfected with these small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors
using FuGENE6 (Roche) according to the instructions of the manufacturer,
followed by 500 Ag/mL of Geneticin selection. The cells from 10 cm dishes
were harvested 7 days later to analyze the knockdown effect on GBARP
or GAD1 by RT-PCR using the above primers. After culturing in appropriate medium containing Geneticin for 2 weeks, the cells were fixed
with 100% methanol, stained with 0.1% of crystal violet/water for colony
formation assay. In 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, cell viability was measured using Cell counting
kit-8 (DOJINDO) at 6 days after the transfection. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm, and at 630 nm as reference, with a Microplate Reader 550
(Bio-Rad).

GABA and GABA receptor agonist/antagonists treatment and PDAC
cell proliferation. GABRP-positive cell lines, KLM-1 and PK-45P, and
GABRP-negative cell lines, PK-59 and KP-1N, were incubated with GABA
(Sigma-Aldrich) or GABA receptor agonist Muscimol (Sigma-Aldrich) at
serial concentration (0, 1, 10, 100 Amol/L) in appropriate medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 6 days. To inhibit the GABA-mediated pathway, cells were incubated with 250 Amol/L of GABAA receptor antagonist
bicuculline methiodide (BMI; Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 mmol/L of GABAB
receptor antagonist CGP-35348 (Sigma-Aldrich). After 6 days of exposure to
either of these drugs, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described
above.
Establishment of GABRP-HA/HEK293 cells and growth assay. Fulllength GABRP cDNA (accession no. NM_014211) was amplified by using
the primer pair with restriction enzyme sites; 5¶-CGGGATCCATGAACTACAGCCTCCACTTG-3¶ and 5¶-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAAAATACATGTAGTATGCCCA-3¶, which contained BamHI
and XhoI restriction sites indicated by the first and second underlines,
respectively. The product was inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites
of pcDNA 5/FRT (Invitrogen) to express a HA-tagged GABRP protein.
Then the pOG44 plasmid and the pcDNA5/FRT-GABRP vector or mock
vector was cotransfected into the Flp-In-293 cells. Cells were selected with
appropriate medium containing 0.2 mg/mL of hygromycin B (Invitrogen)
for 2 weeks, and Western blot analysis using the membrane fraction of the
selected clones confirmed GABRP-HA protein expression. The membrane
fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation with modifications to
a procedure described by Chen et al. (10). Briefly, the cells were suspended
in homogenization buffer [0.25 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail III
(Calbiochem)] and disrupted using a Microson ultrasonic cell disruptor.
Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 600  g for 10 min at 4jC, the
supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000  g for 4jC, the resulting
supernatant was then centrifuged at 60,000  g for 30 min at 4jC in
Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor, and pellets were suspended in lysis buffer [50
mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 20% glycerol, and protease
inhibitor cocktail III]. The protein content of each fraction was
determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum
albumin as a standard. Fifty micrograms of each membrane fraction was
resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). After blocking
with 3% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with
anti-HA high-affinity antibody (3F10, Roche) for 1 h at room temperature
and anti-rat IgG-HRP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 1 h at
room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the reactants were
developed using the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE
Healthcare). The loading quantity of the membrane fraction was evaluated
by anti–E-cadherin antibody (BD Biosciences). Proliferation of HEK293
cells that stably expressed GABRP (GABRP-HA/HEK293) or those transfected with empty pcDNA 5/FRT (Mock/HEK293) were examined by MTT
assay. GABRP-HA/HEK293 or Mock/HEK293 cells (4,000 cells/well) were
seeded on a 24-well plate, and 48 h after seeding, medium was changed to
DMEM with 2% FBS in the presence or absence of 100 Amol/L of GABA.
The MTT assay was done every 24 h for 5 days, using the Cell counting
kit-8 described above. Cell proliferation activity was also evaluated by
(BrdU) incorporation assay. Cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate (3,000
cells/well). After incubation for 48 h, medium was changed to 2% FBS
medium with GABA (0, 1, 10, 100 Amol/L) in the presence or absence 100
Amol/L of BMI, and cells were cultured for 48 h. BrdU incorporation was
measured using cell proliferation ELISA, version 2 (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Intracellular calcium detection. GABRP-HA/HEK293 and Mock/
HEK293 cells were incubated in 5 Amol/L of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes)
dissolved in Krebs buffer (125 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L
MgSO4, 1 mmol/L KH2PO4, 6 mmol/L glucose, 25 mmol/L HEPES,
2 mmol/L CaCl2; pH 7.4) for 45 min at 37jC. Then the cells were washed
and harvested with Krebs buffer. A CAF-110 Intracellular Ion Analyzer
(Jasco Corp.) was used to measure the Fura-2 fluorescence emission (11).
Changes in [Ca2+]i in KLM-1 cells were measured by the Fura-2 method as

described above with minor modifications. The culture medium of cells
grown on 35 mm of poly-L-lysine–coated glass-bottomed dish (MATSUNAMI) was replaced with HBSS (Life Technologies) with 20 mmol/L of
HEPES. The cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubation with 5 Amol/L of
Fura-2 at 37jC for 45 min with or without 100 Amol/L of picrotoxin
(Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 Amol/L of nifedipine (Sigma-Aldrich), and pulsed with
100 Amol/L of GABA. Measurements were carried out at room temperature
using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Ix70, Olympus) and bandpass
filters of 340 and 380 nm wavelengths. Image data were analyzed using a
Ca2+ analyzing system (Aquacosmos/Ratio, Hamamatsu Photonics).
MAPK/Erk cascade evaluation. To assess the activity of the MAPK/
Erk cascade, KLM-1 cells were seeded onto six-well microtiter plates
(2.5  105 cells/well). After 24 h of preincubation, the medium was replaced
with serum-free medium. On the next day, the cells were maintained in
medium containing 100 Amol/L of GABA with or without 100 Amol/L of
picrotoxin or 10 Amol/L of nifedipine for 6 h, then washed with ice-cold
PBS, and harvested in a lysis buffer containing 500 mmol/L of Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L
of EDTA, 1 mmol/L of NaF, 1 mmol/L of NaVO4, and 1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were centrifuged and the pellets
were discarded. After 10% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were subjected to
Western blot analysis using phosho-Erk1/2 (Thr203/Tyr204)–specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The amount of each sample was normalized by total Erk1/2 protein level by using Erk1/2 antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology).
GABA content in PDAC tissues and normal pancreas. Fresh human
PDAC tissues and normal pancreas tissues were obtained from surgical
specimens that were resected in Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and
Cardiovascular Diseases under the appropriate informed consent. The
frozen tissue samples were disrupted using a mortar and dissolved with
cold methanol. Suspended samples were homogenized by sonication and
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4jC. Then the supernatants were
subjected to measurement of GABA contents. GABA measurement was
carried out by a high-performance liquid chromatography method with

fluorimetric detection using O-phthalaldehyde (12). Pellets were dried up
using centrifugal concentrator and its dry weight was measured.

Results
Overexpression of GABRP in PDAC cells. Among dozens of
transactivated genes that were screened by our genome-wide cDNA
microarray analysis of PDAC cells (4), we focused on GABRP for
this study. GABRP overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR in
five of the nine microdissected PDAC cell populations (Fig. 1A).
Northern blot analysis using a GABRP cDNA fragment as the probe
identified an f4.0 kb transcript specifically in the trachea,
prostate, and stomach but no expression was observed in any
other organs including lung, heart, liver, kidney, and brain (Fig. 1B).
We also examined GABRP expression in several PDCA cell lines and
found its expression evidently in KLM-1, PK-45P, and PK-1 cells but
not in other PDAC cell lines (Fig. 1C).
Effect of GABRP-siRNA on the growth of PDAC cells. To
investigate the biological significance of GABRP overexpression in
PDAC cells, we constructed three siRNA expression vectors
(si-pi1, si-pi2, and si-pi3) specific to GABRP transcripts and
transfected them into KLM-1 or PK-45P cells that endogenously
expressed high levels of GABRP as shown in Fig. 1C. A knockdown
effect was observed by RT-PCR when we transfected si-pi2 or
si-pi3, but not si-pi1 or a negative control si-EGFP (Fig. 2A, left).
Colony formation and MTT assays (Fig. 2B and C, left) using
KLM-1 revealed a drastic reduction in the number of cells transfected with si-pi2 and si-pi3, compared with si-pi1 and si-EGFP
for which no knockdown effect was observed. Similar results
were obtained when we transfected these siRNA expression vectors
into PK-45P cells (Fig. 2A, B, and C, right).

Figure 1. GABRP overexpression in
PDAC cells. A, semiquantitative RT-PCR
validated that GABRP expression was
overexpressed in the microdissected
PDAC cells (lanes 1–9 ), compared with
normal pancreatic ductal cells which were
also microdissected (N.P. ), whole normal
pancreatic tissue (T.P. ), and vital organs
(heart, lung, liver, and kidney ). Expression
of TUBA served as the quantitative
control. B, MTN blot analysis for GABRP
expression showed a faint band at the
trachea, prostate, and stomach among the
adult human organs. C, Northern blot
analysis for GABRP expression showed
that several PDAC cell lines (KLM-1,
PK-45P, and PK-1) strongly expressed
GABRP , whereas other normal adult
organs did not express GABRP.

Figure 2. Effect of GABRP -siRNA on the growth of PDAC cells. A, RT-PCR confirmed the knockdown effect on GABRP expression by si-pi2 and si-pi3, but not
by si-pi1 and a negative control si-EGFP in KLM-1 (left ) and PK-45P (right) cells. b2MG was used to quantify RNAs. B, colony formation assay of KLM-1 (left ) and
PK-45P (right ) cells transfected with each of the indicated siRNA-expressing vectors to GABRP (si-pi1, si-pi2, and si-pi3 ) and a negative control vector (si-EGFP ).
Cells were visualized with 0.1% crystal violet staining after 2 wk of incubation with Geneticin. C, MTT assay of each of KLM-1 (left ) and PK-45P (right ) transfected with
the indicated siRNA-expressing vectors to GABRP (si-pi1, si-pi2, and si-pi3 ) and a negative control vector (si-EGFP ). Each average is plotted with error bars indicating
SD after 6 d incubation with Geneticin. Y-axis, absorbance (ABS) at 490 nm, and at 630 nm as reference, measured with a microplate reader. These experiments were
carried out in triplicate. Transfected with si-pi2 and si-pi3 in KLM-1 cells (left ) and PK-45P cells (right ) resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of viable cells,
compared with si-pi1 and si-EGFP for which no knockdown effect was observed (P < 0.01, Student’s t test).

GABA stimulated PDAC cell proliferation through GABAA
receptor. To examine the function of GABRP as a GABA receptor
and the effect of GABA on the growth of GABRP-expressing PDAC
cells, we treated GABRP-positive or -negative PDAC cells
with GABA at several concentrations. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
addition of GABA in the culture media enhanced the proliferation
of GABRP-positive KLM-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner,
although it did not enhance the proliferation of GABRP-negative
PK-59 cells (Fig. 3B). Treatment with the GABA agonist Mucimol
also promoted the proliferation of KLM-1 in a dose-dependent
manner, but such an effect was not observed in GABRP-negative
PK-59 cells (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when
we used other GABRP-positive PK-45P cells and GABRP-negative
KP-1N cells (data not shown).
Then, we treated GABRP-positive KLM-1 cells with GABA
receptor antagonists in the presence or absence of GABA, and
examined the growth-promoting effect of GABA. GABAA receptor
antagonist BMI hammered the growth-promoting effect by GABA,
but GABAB receptor antagonist CGP-35348 did not affect the
growth-promoting effect by GABA (Fig. 3C). On the other hand,
GABRP-negative PK-59 cells did not respond to GABAA or GABAB
receptor antagonists (Fig. 3D). These findings indicated that GABA

www.aacrjournals.org

stimulated PDAC cell growth through GABAA receptors with which
GABRP is likely to be incorporated.
Acquirement of GABA-dependent cell growth of HEK293
cells by introduction of exogenous GABRP. GABAA receptor in
the mature CNS is a heteropentamer consisting mainly of a, h, and
g units. However, because we observed the expression of peripheral
type GABRP subunit alone in PDAC cells, the mechanism of how
the GABAA receptor is formed in its incorporation with GABRP in
PDAC cells is completely unknown. To investigate whether only
GABRP overexpression could contribute to the growth-promoting
effect by GABA, we generated the HEK293-derivative clones that
constitutively expressed exogenous GABRP (GABRP-HA/HEK293,
C1, and C3). In the initial screening, we found that, in most of
the transfected cells, the majority of exogenous GABRP was localized in the cytoplasm and only a small proportion of the protein was located in the plasma membrane. Hence, we selected
the clones that constitutively expressed exogenous GABRP-HA
in the plasma membrane at a relatively high level, which was
examined by Western blot analysis using the plasma membrane
fractions (Fig. 4A), and also by immunocytochemical analysis (data
not shown). As shown in Fig. 4B, the growth rates of C1 and C3
were similar to those of the control mock-transfected clones

(Mock/HEK293, M1, and M2) in the absence of GABA. However,
the treatment with GABA clearly enhanced the proliferation of C1
and C3 clones, whereas it did not enhance the growth of M1 and
M2 clones. This growth-promoting effect by GABA was observed
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C), and this growth-promoting
effect was inhibited by GABAA receptor antagonist BMI (Fig. 4D).
Taken together, our findings implicated the possibility that overexpression of GABRP alone could form GABAA receptor and contribute to the GABA-dependent growth promotion in PDAC cells.
GABA changed intracellular Ca2+ in GABRP-expressing cells.
Although GABA hyperpolarizes the membrane of mature neurons,
it depolarizes the membrane in immature neurons and glial tumor
cells. It could also influence the proliferation or differentiation of
these cells through membrane depolarization (8, 13). The GABA
receptor is an ionotropic receptor permeable Cl ion and GABA
stimulation is able to hyperpolarize or depolarize the cell, depending on the intracellular Cl concentration. The depolarizing action
by GABA activates voltage Ca2+ channels, leading to an elevation of
[Ca2+]i (6). Therefore, we characterized the intracellular Ca2+
response triggered by GABA by using a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator.
In Ca2+ mobilization experiments, GABA treatment clearly
increased [Ca2+]i in GABRP-HA/HEK293 cells at a concentration
of 100 Amol/L (Fig. 5A). In contrast, GABA did not increase [Ca2+]i

in Mock/HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). These findings indicated that
GABRP could form the GABA-responsive channel which could
induce [Ca2+]i. Then, we investigated Ca2+ mobilization in GABRPpositive PDAC cell line KLM-1 by treatment with GABA, and picrotoxin (PTX), or nifedipine (NIF). GABA treatment significantly
increased [Ca2+]i in KLM-1 cells (Fig. 5B, top) as well as in GABRPHA/HEK293 cells. This increase of [Ca2+]i was completely blocked
by GABAA chloride channel blocker picrotoxin treatment (Fig. 5B,
middle). This [Ca2+]i change triggered by GABA was also blocked
by nifedipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel of the L-subtype
(VGCCL) blocker (Fig. 5C, bottom), clearly indicating that GABA
increased [Ca2+]i in KLM-1 through the activation of GABAA
receptor, in which GABRP played a key role.
GABA activated MAPK/Erk cascade through the intracellular Ca2+. One of the consequences of [Ca2+]i involved in cell
proliferation is considered to be the activation of the MAPK/Erk
cascade (13). Hence, we examined the activity of the MAPK/Erk
cascade in KLM-1 cells in the presence of GABA, and picrotoxin
(PTX) or nifedipine (NIF). As shown in Fig. 5C, GABA treatment
induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in PDAC cells, and GABAA
receptor chloride channel blocker picrotoxin inhibited this GABAinduced phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Similarly, Ca2+ channel blocker
nifedipine also blocked GABA-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2.

Figure 3. GABA treatment stimulated GABRP-positive PDAC cell proliferation. A, GABRP-positive KLM-1 cells were incubated with GABA at serial concentrations
(0, 1, 10, 100 Amol/L) for 6 d, and the growth-promoting effect of each GABA concentration was shown (Y-axis). GABA treatment promoted the growth of
GABRP-positive cells dose-dependently (*, P < 0.01, Student’s t test). B, GABRP-negative PK-59 cells were incubated with GABA at serial concentrations (0, 1, 10,
100 Amol/L) for 6 d, and the growth-promoting effect of each GABA concentration was shown (Y-axis). GABA treatment did not significantly promote the growth
of GABRP-negative cells. C, GABRP-positive KLM-1 cells were incubated with GABAA receptor antagonist BMI at 250 Amol/L or GABAB receptor antagonist
CGP-35348 (CGP ) at 1 mmol/L, in the presence or absence of 100 Amol/L of GABA, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay after 6 d of exposure. GABAA
receptor antagonist BMI, but not GABAB receptor antagonist CGP-35348, hammered the growth-promoting effect by GABA (**, P < 0.01, Student’s t test). D,
GABRP-negative PK-59 cells were incubated with GABAA receptor antagonist BMI at 250 Amol/L or GABAB receptor antagonist CGP-35348 (CGP ) at 1 mmol/L, in the

Figure 4. Growth-promoting effect of GABA on GABRP-HA/HEK293. A, Western blot analysis with anti–HA-tag antibody validated the exogenous HA-tagged
GABRP expression at the plasma membrane fraction of C1 and C3 clones of GABRP-HA/HECK293. M1 and M2 were the clones transfected with the mock vector
(Mock/HECK293 ). E-Cadherin served as a loading control of the plasma membrane fraction. B, GABRP-HA/HEK293 cells (C1 and C3 ) and Mock/HEK293 cells
(M1 and M2 ) were incubated with or without 100 Amol/L of GABA, supplied with 3% FBS. X -axis, days after GABA treatment; Y-axis, relative growth rate, which was
calculated in absorbance of the diameter by comparison with the absorbance value of day 0 as a control. Points, averages of experiments done in triplicate; bars, SD.
The growth rates of C1 and C3 were similar to those of the controls M1 and M2 in the absence of GABA. GABA treatment stimulated the proliferation of C1 and
C3 clones (*, P < 0.01, Student’s t test), whereas GABA did not stimulate the growth of M1 and M2 clones. C, BrdU incorporation assay showed GABA treatment
(1, 10, 100 Amol/L) stimulated the proliferation of GABRP-HA/HEK293 cells (C1, closed columns ) dose-dependently, but not Mock/HEK293 cells (M1, open columns ).
Y-axis, relative growth rate. D, growth-promoting effect by 100 Amol/L of GABA on GABRP-HA/HEK293 was hammered by BMI (250 Amol/L) treatment (**, P < 0.01,
Student’s t test). Y-axis, relative growth rate.

Figure 5D showed the relative ratio of the phosphorylated Erk1/2
with the total Erk1/2, which were quantified by the densitometric
analyses of Fig. 5C. These results supported the hypothesis that
GABA stimulation activated the MAPK/Erk cascade through
GABAA receptor activation and Ca2+ influx in PDAC cells.
GABA ligand content in PDAC tissues and GAD1 expression
in PDAC cells. We showed that GABAA receptor involved with
GABRP functioned in a growth-promoting pathway in PDAC cells.
To further validate the significance of the GABA/GABA receptor
pathway in PDAC, we measured GABA ligand content in 15 human
PDAC tissues and 12 normal pancreatic tissues by using a highperformance liquid chromatography method with fluorimetric
detection using O-phthalaldehyde. As a result, the mean value of
GABA ligand in normal pancreatic tissues was 277.3 nmol/g of dry
tissue, and none of the 12 normal pancreas tissues contained
500 nmol/g of dry tissue (Fig. 6A). In contrast, PDAC tissues had
significantly higher content of GABA ligand (554.6 nmol/g of dry
tissue, P < 0.05) in their mean values, and five of them contained
>500 nmol/g of dry tissue of GABA, indicating that PDAC tissues

www.aacrjournals.org

were abundant in GABA ligand. GABA ligand is produced mainly
by GAD1 (or GAD67) or GAD2 (or GAD65) enzymes in the CNS
(14, 15), or in the islet cells in the pancreas. Our microarray analysis
on PDAC cells suggested high transcriptional levels of GAD1 in
PDAC cells, and we validated the expression of GAD1 and GAD2 by
RT-PCR using the microdissected PDAC cells. As shown in Fig. 6B,
GAD1 expression was significantly up-regulated in PDAC cells,
compared with that of normal pancreatic duct cells (N.P.) or total
normal pancreas (T.P.). These findings implicated that PDAC
cells could produce GABA ligand by themselves and GABA/GABA
receptors could stimulate PDAC cell growth in an autocrine/
paracrine manner.
Knocking down GAD1-suppressed PDAC cell viability. To
investigate whether GABA production by GAD1 could stimulate
PDAC cell growth in an autocrine/paracrine manner, we constructed siRNA-expressing vectors specific to GAD1 and transfected
them into GABRP-positive and GAD1-positive PDAC cell KLM-1. A
knockdown effect was observed by RT-PCR when we transfected
si-G4 and si-G3, but not si-G1 and the negative control si-EGFP

(Fig. 6C). Colony-formation assays (Fig. 6D) and MTT assays
(Fig. 6E) revealed a drastic reduction in the number of cells transfected with si-G2 and si-G3, compared with si-G1 and a negative
control si-EGFP for which no knockdown effect was observed. Similar effects were obtained with the PK-45P cell line (data not shown).

Discussions
In this study, we validated the overexpression of GABRP in nearly
half of the PDACs and found that GABRP was moderately
expressed in few normal organs, implicating that GABRP is a good
molecular target for the development of novel PDCA therapies with
a minimal risk of side effects, with regards to its expression pattern.
Functional analysis using siRNA as well as exogenous introduction
of GABRP strongly supported its involvement in the development
and progression of PDAC. Primary, GABA and GABA receptors
function as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature CNS, but
their precise functions in nonneuronal cells or tumor cells are
unknown. Azuma et al. reported that the GABA and GABAB
receptor pathway could involve prostate cancer metastasis or

invasion through the regulation of metalloproteinase production
(16). On the other hand, another report showed that GABA could
inhibit colon cancer migration associated with the norepinephrineinduced pathway (17). Thus, it is controversial whether GABAassociated pathways could act positively or negatively in the
regulation of cancer cell behavior. However, our findings in this
study could clearly indicate evidence supporting the theory that
GABA and GABAA receptor with GABRP promoted PDAC cell
proliferation. Although GABA usually induces hyperpolarization in
adult neurons, GABA has been shown to exert depolarizing
responses in the immature CNS structures and CNS tumors (6,
18). In particular, GABA increased the proliferation of immature
cerebellar granule cells through the activation of GABAA receptors
and voltage-dependent calcium channels (8). Several pieces of
evidence support the trophic action of GABA during CNS
development, and the purported mediator of these trophic effects
is a depolarizing response triggered by GABA, which elicits a
calcium influx in immature CNS cells (19). In our study on PDAC
cells, GABA-inducing Ca2+ influx was observed in GABRP-positive
cells, but not in GABRP-negative cells. This GABA-inducing Ca2+

Figure 5. GABA induced Ca2+ influx and activated MAPK/Erk cascade. A, GABA treatment induced calcium mobilization in GABRP-HA/HEK293, but not in
Mock/HEK293. B, calcium mobilization in GABRP-positive KLM-1 cells was induced by 100 Amol/L of GABA, but not with solution only. In the presence of 200 Amol/L
of picrotoxin (PTX , GABA Cl channel blocker) or 10 Amol/L of nifedipine (NIF , Ca2+ channel blocker), GABA treatment did not induce calcium mobilization in
KLM-1 cells. C, GABA treatment increased the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 in KLM-1 cells, compared with nontreatment ( / ). In the presence of 200 Amol/L of
picrotoxin (PTX ) or 10 Amol/L of nifedipine (NIF ), GABA treatment did not increase the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 in KLM-1 cells. Erk1/2 was detected by
Western blot analysis using the antibody specific to phosphorylated Erk1/2, and the antibody to Erk1/2 to evaluate the total level of Erk1/2 proteins. D, the relative ratios
of phosphorylated Erk1/2 with the total levels of Erk1/2, which were quantified by the densitometric analysis of (C ).

Figure 6. GABA ligand content and GAD expression in PDACs and effect of GABRP-siRNAs on the growth of PDAC cells. A, GABA ligand content in the normal
pancreas tissues (n = 12) and PDAC tissues (n = 15). Normalized by dry weight of each sample. Means of GABA ligand content in PDAC tissues (554.6 nmol/g
of dry tissue) were significantly higher than those in normal pancreas (277.3 nmol/g of dry tissue, Student’s t test; P < 0.05). B, RT-PCR analysis of GABA-producing
enzymes GAD1 and GAD2. GAD1 expression, but not GAD2 expression, was up-regulated in PDAC cells compared with normal pancreatic ductal cells (N.P. ).
Expression of TUBA served as the quantitative control. C, semiquantitative RT-PCR confirmed the knockdown effect on GAD1 expression by si-G2 and si-G3,
but not by si-G1 and a negative control si-EGFP. b2MG was used to quantify RNAs. D, colony formation assay of KLM-1 cells transfected with each of indicated
siRNA-expressing vectors to GAD1 (si-G1, si-G2, and si-G3 ) and a negative control vector (si-EGFP ). Cells were visualized with 0.1% crystal violet staining after
2 wk of incubation with Geneticin. E, MTT assay of KLM-1 cells transfected with indicated siRNA-expressing vectors to GAD1 (si-G1, si-G2 and si-G3 ) and a negative
control vector (si-EGFP ). Columns, averages plotted after 2 wk of incubation with Geneticin; bars, SD. Y-axis, absorbance (ABS) at 490 nm, and at
630 nm as reference, measured with a microplate reader. These experiments were carried out in triplicate.

influx in PDAC cells was hammered by a GABAA receptor chloride
channel inhibitor (picrotoxin) as well as a Ca2+ blocker (nifedipine).
The significant activation of the MAPK/Erk cascade was also
observed after GABA treatment on PDAC cells, and this activation
by GABA was inhibited by the Ca2+ blocker nifedipine, as well as by
the GABAA receptor chloride channel inhibitor picrotoxin.
Therefore, it is evident that GABA can induce Ca2+ influx through
GABRP-associated GABAA receptor and VGCCL, and subsequently
activate MAPK/Erk cascade in PDAC cells, resulting in the growth
promotion of PDAC cells. Increases of the intracellular Ca2+
activate various signaling pathways which are essential for cell
growth and survival. It was reported that Ca2+ influx could activate
the MAPK/Erk cascade through calmodulin in neural cells and
promote neural growth and synaptic plasticity (19, 20), and Ca2+/
calmodulin may be critical for the link between Ca2+ influx and the
activation of the MAPK/Erk cascade in PDAC cells as well. Further
studies are required to clarify this link between Ca2+ influx and the
activation of the MAPK/Erk cascade or other growth/survival
signaling pathways in PDAC cells.
GABAA receptor in the CNS forms a heteropentamer consisting
mainly of ahg subunits, and a few reports indicated that the
GABRP subunit could assemble with these known GABAA receptor

www.aacrjournals.org

subunits, and the incorporation of GABRP into GABAA receptor
altered its affinity to GABA or modulatory agents (5). In PDAC cells,
however, the expressions of other main GABAA receptor subunits
such as a, h, and g subunits were very limited in our RT-PCR
analysis (data not shown), and it is largely unknown how GABRP
could form the GABAA receptor in PDAC cells. In this study, we
established the HEK293 clones in which GABRP alone was exogenously overexpressed and found that these clones showed the
intracellular Ca2+ change and the growth-promoting effect in response to GABA treatment, including the possibility of the
homopentamer formation of GABRP as well as GABA rho subunit
(21), although the possibility that other endogenous GABAA receptor
subunits in HEK293 cells could form a functional heteropentamer
together with overexpressing GABRP was not excluded.
We also found an abundance of GABA ligands in clinical PDAC
tissues. Elevated expression of GABA-producing enzymes, GADs,
was indicated in certain types of human tumors such as colon
cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer (22–24). GAD was
reported to be expressed in pancreas tissues, mainly in islet cells
(25), but our study showed its up-regulation in PDAC cells.
Interestingly, knocking down of GAD1 expression in PDAC cells
resulted in the suppression of PDAC cell growth, similar to the

knocking down of GABRP. Therefore, it should be suggested that
GABA/GABRP could function in an autocrine/paracrine manner in
PDAC cells and promote cell growth.
Blocking of GABRP or GABA function on PDAC cell by small
molecules or antibody can provide a promising new approach to
molecular therapy for deleterious PDACs. However, the presently
available GABAA inhibitors such as bicuculline and picrotoxin can
affect GABAA receptor in the CNS inhibitory neurons and induce
severe convulsions in vivo (26). Hence, to avoid the risk of severe
adverse reactions, it should be a key issue to develop antagonistic
drugs that are very specific to the receptor, in which GABRP is the

major component, and/or ones that have no ability to penetrate
the blood-brain barrier.
