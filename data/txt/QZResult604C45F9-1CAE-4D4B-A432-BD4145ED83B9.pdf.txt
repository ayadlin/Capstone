Abstract
The tumorigenic potential of ionizing radiation has conventionally been attributed to DNA damage in irradiated cells
induced at the time of exposure. Recently, there have been an
increasing number of reports of damage in unirradiated cells
that are either neighbors or descendants of irradiated cells,
respectively, regarded as bystander effects and genomic
instability and collectively termed nontargeted effects. In this
study, we show that descendants of normal murine hemaopoietic clonogenic stem cells exposed to bone marrow–
conditioned medium derived from ;-irradiated mice exhibit
chromosomal instability unlike the descendants of directly
;-irradiated cells. The instability is expressed in bone marrow
cells of the radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (r-AML)
susceptible strain (CBA/Ca) but not in mice resistant to r-AML
(C57BL/6). Furthermore, crossgenetic experiments show the
induction of the instability phenotype requires both the
producer and responder cells to be of the susceptible CBA/Ca
genotype. Macrophages are the source of the bystander signals,
and the signaling mechanism involves tumor necrosis factor-A,
nitric oxide, and superoxide. The findings show a genotypedependent chromosomal instability phenotype induced by
radiation-induced macrophage-mediated bystander signaling.
As the majority of accidental, occupational, and therapeutic
exposures to ionizing radiation are partial body exposures, the
findings have implications for understanding the consequences
of such exposure. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8122–6]

Introduction
The major adverse consequences of radiation exposures are
attributed to DNA damage in irradiated cells induced at the time of
exposure that has not been correctly restored by metabolic repair
processes. Recently, however, a number of studies have shown that
not all genetic damage is attributable to lesions induced at the time
of exposure in the cell nucleus or in the irradiated cell itself. These
studies have shown effects, characteristic of radiation responses in
directly irradiated cells, in nonirradiated cells as a consequence of
communication between irradiated and nonirradiated cells. The
findings are broadly grouped into two categories, effects in the
unirradiated descendants of irradiated cells, collectively regarded
as radiation-induced genomic instability, and effects in unirradiated cells that have received signals produced by neighboring irradiated cells, collectively regarded as radiation-induced

bystander effects (1–8). It is not understood whether nontargeted
effects have a common underlying mechanism, and as the majority
of published studies of nontargeted effects have used in vitro model
systems, the relevance to in vivo responses is not understood.
However, delayed chromosome aberrations, characteristic of a
chromosomal instability phenotype, have been shown in the bone
marrow of irradiated CBA/Ca mice (9), and clastogenic factors,
able to induce chromosome damage in unirradiated cells, have
been shown in the blood of radiotherapy patients, Japanese atomic
bomb survivors, and Chernobyl liquidators (4, 5, 10, 11). The
relationship of the production of clastogenic factors to the
demonstration of delayed unstable chromosome aberrations
in vivo has not been established, but clastogenic factors, delayed
cellular damage responses, and delayed unstable chromosomal
aberrations have all been associated with genotype-dependent
inflammatory processes (10, 12, 13). Late-appearing adverse
chronic side effects in unavoidably irradiated normal tissues of
radiotherapy patients are also associated with such processes (14).
The majority of accidental, occupational, and therapeutic human
exposures to ionizing radiation are partial body exposures, and a
better understanding of the consequences of such exposures
requires a better understanding of the interactions between
irradiated and nonirradiated cells.
Because the responses of the hemaopoietic system are major
determinants of outcome after exposure to ionizing radiation, we
are conducting studies to compare responses in CBA/Ca mice and
C57BL/6 mice that are, respectively, susceptible or resistant to
the development of radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (15).
In previous studies of the in vivo response to a potentially
leukemogenic dose of ionizing radiation, we showed a marked
genotype-dependent macrophage activation in the hemaopoietic
system (12) in which CBA/Ca macrophages have an enhanced
classically activated M1-like (proinflammatory) phenotype, whereas C57BL/6 macrophages expressed an enhanced M2-like (antiinflammatory/wound healing) phenotype (16). In irradiated CBA/
Ca mice, there is also a persisting chromosomal instability
phenotype (9). In the present study, we have shown that macrophages obtained from the bone marrow of irradiated CBA/Ca, but
not C57BL/6 mice, are able to induce chromosomal instability
assayed as nonclonal cytogenetic aberrations in the clonal
descendants of nonirradiated stem cells as a consequence of
proinflammatory cytokine signaling. The findings may also be
regarded as a radiation-induced genotype-dependent bystander
effect triggering an instability phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Irradiation. CBA/Ca and C57BL/6 mice were bred in-house under
conventional conditions. Suspensions of femoral bone marrow were
obtained from 8- to 16-wk-old male mice that had been g irradiated
(or sham irrradiated) at a dose rate of 0.4 Gy/min using a Bio International

were analyzed, data from 3 to 6 replicate experiments were pooled after
decoding, and differences between the proportions of aberrant cells were
analyzed by the Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 1).
Macrophage separation. Macrophages were isolated from the femora of
CBA/Ca or C57BL/6 mice with or without whole body 4 Gy g-irradiation
24 h previously. Bone marrow was gently expelled from the diaphysis with
air pushed through 23G needles by syringe, and cell clumps were digested
with medium containing liberase (1.67 Wunsch units/mL) and 0.2 mg/mL
DNase (Roche) for 30 min at 37jC. Cells were collected in lipopolysaccharide-free PBS containing 2 mmol/L EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(Invitrogen). Macrophages were positively selected using F4/80 antibody
followed by anti-rat immunoglobulin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec; ref. 16).
The whole separation procedure took 3 h. Postseparation, cytocentrifuge
preparations revealed cells to be >90% monocytes and macrophages, and
these were incubated overnight at 37jC, 5%CO2 in air in a-MEM medium
containing 20% pretested horse serum. Macrophages were collected in their
culture medium, spun at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and filtered as before to
produce irradiated or control macrophage–conditioned medium (IMCM or
CMCM). The conditioned medium were assayed as described above using a
ratio of producer macrophages to responder bone marrow cells of 1:2.
Signaling studies. A neutralizing antibody directed against tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-a (R &D Systems) and a scavenger of reactive oxygen
species and DMSO and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO), respectively, (Sigma) were used. To investigate the
response to potential signaling molecules, inhibitors/blocking agents were
added to the clonogenic culture medium before the addition of unirradiated
assay cells, and the conditioned medium was prepared from the separated
F4/80-positive cells. Toxicity studies for each inhibitor/blocking agent were
performed using the CFU-A assay, and the highest concentration that
was nontoxic was selected for these studies: 1 Ag/mL anti–TNF-a, 50 Am
c-PTIO, and 0.05% DMSO.

ethical review and carried out in compliance with Home Office Project
Licences PPL 60/2841 and 60/3564.
Assay of conditioned medium and clonal cytogenetic analysis.
Immediately after irradiation, bone marrow cells were suspended at
5.106 cells/mL and the supernatant medium obtained by centrifugation at
1,000 rpm for 5 min and filtration through a 0.45-Am membrane to obtain
irradiated cell–conditioned medium (ICCM). In parallel with control cell–
conditioned medium derived from unirradiated mice (CCCM), ICCM was
assayed at cell equivalent concentrations at a ratio of 1:1 producer/assay
cells as used previously to study macrophage-derived stem cell proliferation
regulators (18). Immediately after mixing, an in vitro clonogenic assay,
operationally defined as the CFU-A assay, was used to obtain clones of
myelo-monocytic cells derived from members of the hemaopoietic stem cell
compartment (19). The time from the initiation of irradiation to the
initiation of the clonogenic cultures is f1 h. Cytogenetic preparations were
obtained from individual colonies 7 to 9 d (10–13 cell divisions) after
initiation of cultures using a previously reported method for karyotyping
hemaopoietic colonies (20). Chromosomal aberrations in coded samples

Results
The clonal progeny of CBA/Ca short-term repopulating stem
cells were studied using a clonogenic assay (operationally defined
as CFU-A), and the chromosomal instability phenotype were
assessed by the presence of nonclonal aberrations, i.e., in any
individual clone, not all cells are karyotypically abnormal and any
aberrant cells are not a subclone as each cell exhibits a different
aberration. The aberrations that characterize this instability
phenotype are unstable aberrations, that is, chromatid breaks,
chromosome fragments, and minutes indicative of ongoing

chromosome breakage (1, 2, 3, 24). In colonies derived from bone
marrow obtained immediately postirradiation (Table 1), the
proportion of cells with nonclonal aberrations was not significantly
different from controls (7.6% versus 10.3%; P = 0.2146). Using the
same in vitro assay, the proportion of cells with nonclonal
aberrations in colonies initiated from normal CBA/Ca bone
marrow exposed to conditioned medium obtained from CBA/Ca
mice exposed to 4 Gy g-rays (ICCM) was significantly increased
relative to the control colonies derived from nonirradiated bone
marrow (17.4% versus 10.3%; P = 0.0031).This increase was not
found in colonies derived from CBA/Ca bone marrow exposed to
CCCM, i.e., obtained from the bone marrow of nonirradiated CBA/
Ca mice (9.0% versus 10.3%; P = 0.3151). Thus, exposure to ICCM,
but not CCCM, resulted in an increased frequency of cells with
nonclonal cytogenetic aberrations in colonies initiated from
normal CBA/Ca bone marrow. The mean number of aberrations
per cell (0.232) was increased by comparison with the control value
(0.147), and the aberrations were characterized by chromatid and
chromosome breaks typical of the chromosomal instability
phenotype.
The proportion of cells with nonclonal aberrations (11.2%) in
colonies initiated from C57BL/6 bone marrow (Table 1) was slightly
greater than that of the CBA/Ca cells (10.3%), but the difference
was not significant (P = 0.4172). In colonies derived from C57BL/6
bone marrow obtained immediately postirradiation, such as the

situation with CBA/Ca bone marrow, the proportion of cells with
nonclonal aberrations was not significantly different from the
controls (13.6% versus 11.2%; P = 0.3238). There was no significant
effect of treatment with C57BL/6 CCCM (11.4% aberrant cells;
P = 0.5378), and the frequency of aberrations in colonies initiated
from C57BL/6 bone marrow exposed to ICCM was slightly
increased (14.2%) but not significantly so (P = 0.2138).
Because the frequency of nonclonal aberrations in colonies
initiated from CBA/Ca bone marrow exposed to CBA/Ca ICCM was
increased relative to controls but not in colonies initiated from
C57BL/6 bone marrow exposed to C57BL/6 ICCM, we investigated
the potential for ICCM from one genotype to produce the
instability phenotype in normal bone marrow obtained from the
other genotype. As shown in Table 2, the proportion of cells with
nonclonal aberrations in colonies initiated from CBA/Ca bone
marrow exposed to conditioned medium obtained from irradiated
C57BL/6 mice (6.3%) was not greater than that in colonies initiated
from CBA bone marrow exposed to conditioned medium obtained
from nonirradiated C57BL/6 mice (8.3%; P = 0.3833). In neither
case was the aberration frequency greater than the 10.3% in the
CBA/Ca control (P = 0.14794 and 0.3456, respectively). Similarly, the
proportion of cells with nonclonal aberrations in colonies initiated
from C57BL/6 bone marrow exposed to conditioned medium
obtained from irradiated CBA/Ca mice (8.2%) was not greater than
that in colonies initiated from C57BL/6 bone marrow exposed to

Macrophage-Induced Bystander Chromosomal Instability

conditioned medium obtained from nonirradiated CBA/Ca mice
(12%; P = 0.2725) and not significantly different from the C57BL/6
control (11.2%; P = 0.2725 and 0.4972, respectively). Thus, both
signal production and signal response exhibit the same genotype
dependency with CBA/Ca, but not C57BL/6, mice able to produce
and respond to signals that lead to the expression of delayed
chromosomal aberrations.
To investigate the potential for macrophages to be the cellular
source of the activity in the CBA/Ca ICCM, macrophages were
isolated from the bone marrow of irradiated or nonirradiated CBA/
Ca mice using the F4/80 pan-macrophage antibody and used to
produce macrophage conditioned medium (IMCM and CMCM,
respectively). Exposure to IMCM (Table 3) increased the proportion
of cells with nonclonal cytogenetic aberrations in colonies initiated
from normal bone marrow relative to the proportion in colonies
derived from bone marrow exposed to CMCM (13.8% versus 7.3%;
P = 0.04701). The effect induced by IMCM (Table 3) was not
significantly different from that shown in Table 1 as induced by
ICCM (13.8% versus 17.4%; P = 0.1583), indicating that products of
macrophages obtained from irradiated CBA/Ca bone marrow were
capable of producing the same effect as products of the total
irradiated bone marrow from the same strain. TNF-a was
implicated in the mechanism underlying the macrophage-mediated
chromosomal instability phenotype by the addition of a neutralizing antibody. The treatment reduced the proportion of CBA/Ca
cells with nonclonal aberrations in cultures treated with CBA/Ca
IMCM to control levels (13.8–6.3%; P = 0.0436), a value
indistinguishable from that resulting from exposure to CMCM in
the presence of the antibody (6.4%; P = 0.6395). To investigate the
potential involvement of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, DMSO
or c-PTIO (respectively, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and
nitric oxide) was added simultaneously with the conditioned
medium. Either treatment (Table 3) was shown to reduce the
proportion of cells with nonclonal aberrations in cultures treated
with IMCM to control levels, 13.8% to 8.1% and 5.2% for DMSO and
c-PTIO, respectively. Thus, there was no significant difference
between the proportion of aberrant cells in colonies treated with
IMCM and DMSO, or CMCM and DMSO (8.1% versus 6.9%;
P = 0.1794), and similar findings were recorded for IMCM and
c-PTIO, or CMCM and c-PTIO (5.2% and 4.8%; P = 0.7516).

Discussion
This study was designed to investigate the potential of bone
marrow exposed to g-radiation in vivo to produce factors able to
induce a chromosomal instability phenotype shown as nonclonal
cytogenetic aberrations in the clonal progeny of short-term
repopulating hemaopoietic stem cells. The bone marrow cells
studied were obtained from CBA/Ca and C57BL/6 mice, strains
that are, respectively, susceptible and resistant to radiation-induced
acute myeloid leukemia, and 4Gy g-irradiation is the optimal
leukaemogenic dose. A chromosomal instability phenotype (i.e., an
increased incidence of nonclonal unstable abberations) has been
shown after exposure of clonogenic cells to medium conditioned by
bone marrow (Table 1) or bone marrow macrophages (Table 3)
obtained from irradiated CBA/Ca mice but not from C57BL/6 mice.
These findings are consistent with previous studies that showed
expression of the chromosomal instability phenotype being
strongly influenced by genetic factors (21–23). Previously, we
showed radiation-induced chromosomal instability in primary
clonogenic hemaopoietic cells after exposure to a-particles when,

www.aacrjournals.org

in the same study, the phenotype was not detected after exposure
to 3 Gy X-rays (24). Therefore, the question arises as to why
chromosomal instability is detected in the same in vitro clonogenic
system after exposure to a-particles but not X-rays or g-rays. A
particular feature of the in vitro a-irradiation study was that more
colonies exhibited instability than the number of clonogenic cells
traversed by the Poisson distribution of a-particles, and the data
were consistent with an indirect (bystander) mechanism contributing to the a-particle–induced instability phenotype. This was
subsequently confirmed by direct experiment in which the absence
or presence of a shielding grid between the source of a-particles
and the cells was used to manipulate the ratio of irradiated to
nonirradiated clonogenic cells, and the instability phenotype was
shown in the descendants of nonirradiated cells mediated by a
bystander mechanism (25). In the present study, all the cells
assayed in the conditioned medium investigations are derived from
nonirradiated clonogenic cells, and expression of the instability
phenotype in primary bone marrow cells requires some genotypedependent interaction of nonirradiated and irradiated cells.
The genotype dependency could be due to the ability to produce
the relevant signal(s) and/or the ability to respond to the signal(s).
In the present study, we have shown that chromosomal instability
is not exhibited in colonies initiated from C57BL/6 bone marrow
exposed to conditioned medium obtained from irradiated CBA/Ca
mice or in CBA/Ca bone marrow exposed to conditioned medium
obtained from irradiated C57BL/6 mice (Table 2). Thus, both signal
production and signal response exhibit a genotype dependency
such that CBA/Ca-type, but not C57BL/6-type, signaling, and
response, allows expression of the phenotype. The results of the cell
separation studies support macrophages being the source of the
signals mediating the effect in CBA/Ca cells (Table 3), and TNF-a
signaling is implicated in the mechanism (Table 3).
TNF-a is a major proinflammatory cytokine secreted by
macrophages (26) and its wide range of biological activities include
the ability to induce DNA damage, including DNA strand breaks, at
concentrations that are not acutely toxic (27). The reduction in the
proportion of CBA/Ca cells with nonclonal aberrations in cultures
treated with IMCM by DMSO treatment additionally implicates
oxidative stress as contributing to the development and/or
maintenance of the genomic instability phenotype as suggested
by previous findings of increased levels of reactive oxygen species
associated with instability (28–30). Reactive nitrogen species are
also implicated in the chromosomal instability phenotype as the
presence of c-PTIO, a scavenger of nitric oxide, similarly reduces
the proportion of cells with nonclonal aberrations in cultures
treated with IMCM (Table 2). The involvement of other signaling
molecules is not excluded by this study as it is known that TNF-a
may induce the expression of other cytokines and cytokine
receptors (31).
TNF-a and oxidative stress have previously been implicated as a
component of the poorly characterized mechanisms underlying the
toxicity of clastogenic factors (32) where there is considerable
interindividual variation in both production of, and response to,
such factors consistent with genotype-dependency (33). The
present findings support proposals (11) that inflammatory
processes provide a mechanistic link between radiation-induced
chromosomal instability, bystander effects, and clastogenic factors.
Our recent demonstration of genotype-specific gene and protein
expression profiles of CBA/Ca and C57BL/6 macrophages also
support an underlying genotype-dependent inflammatory mechanism as C57BL/6 macrophages in haemopoietic tissues have an

anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype after irradiation in vivo,
whereas CBA/Ca macrophages express a proinflammatory M1-such
as phenotype (16, 34). Overall, our data are consistent with
macrophages having the potential to contribute secondary damage
as a consequence of genotype-dependent inflammatory responses
to the initial radiation-induced injury and, therefore, of contributing to the differential expression of nontargeted and delayed
radiation effects. Furthermore, these processes may be considered
as part of the ‘‘danger’’ signaling that mobilizes the innate and
acquired immune system to maintain the integrity of the body after
exposure to a variety of pathologic, chemical, or physical agents
that mediate local tissue recovery or under certain circumstances
contribute to a damaging tissue microenvironment (35).
