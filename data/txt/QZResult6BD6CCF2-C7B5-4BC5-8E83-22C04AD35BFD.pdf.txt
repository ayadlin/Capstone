Abstract
The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and autophosphorylated
Ser1981-ATM are involved in recognizing and repairing DNA
damage, such as double-strand breaks (DSB). However, the role
of these factors in response to stalled replication forks is not
clear. Nucleoside analogues are agents that are incorporated
into DNA during replication, which cause stalling of replication forks. The molecular mechanisms that sense these events
may signal for DNA repair and contribute to survival but are
poorly understood. Cellular responses to both DSBs and stalled
replication forks are marked by H2AX phosphorylation on
Ser139 (;-H2AX), which forms nuclear foci at sites of DNA
damage. Here, concentrations of the nucleoside analogues
1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytarabine; ara-C), gemcitabine, and troxacitabine, which inhibited DNA synthesis by 90%
within 2 hours, were determined for each agent. Using ;-H2AX
as a marker for changes in chromatin structure, we show
that Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, and phosphorylated ATM respond
to nucleoside analogue–induced stalled replication forks by
forming nuclear foci that colocalize with ;-H2AX within
2 hours. Because neither DSBs nor single-strand breaks were
detectable after nucleoside analogue exposure, we conclude
that this molecular response is not due to the presence of DNA
breaks. Deficiencies in ATM, Mre11, or Rad50 led to a 2- to
5-fold increase in clonogenic sensitization to gemcitabine,
whereas Nbs1 and H2AX deficiency did not affect reproductive
growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ATM, Mre11,
and Rad50 are required for survival after replication fork
stalling, whereas Nbs1 and H2AX are inconsequential. [Cancer

Introduction
Endogenous and exogenous events that hinder replication fork
progression threaten both cellular survival and genome integrity.
Therefore, molecular mechanisms that monitor and regulate fork
progression are necessary to safeguard DNA replication under
these circumstances (1). However, this capability likely contributes
to resistance to pharmacologic agents that target DNA replication,
such as those that cause steric hindrance (i.e., aphidicolin),
decrease the deoxynucleotide pool (i.e., hydroxyurea), or block

DNA synthesis of the nascent strand (i.e., nucleoside analogues).
Upon cellular entry and phosphorylation to their active metabolites, many nucleoside analogues are incorporated into replicating
DNA and cause replication forks to stall, as they are poor substrates
for chain extension (2). Cells respond to these events by activating
the ATR-Chk1-Cdk2 S-phase checkpoint pathway (3, 4), which
blocks firing of new replication origins and enforces cell cycle
arrest. This likely enables DNA repair mechanisms to react to sites
of DNA damage and contribute to survival.
The molecules that recognize nucleoside analogue–induced
stalled replication forks and signal for repair processes are not
well-characterized. Our prior studies showed that cells respond
rapidly to nucleoside analogue exposure by causing phosphorylation of the DNA damage responsive histone, H2AX, and the
phosphoinositol kinase–like kinase, ATM (4). The function of H2AX
is not fully understood, but it is likely involved in anchoring
damage-response proteins to sites of DNA damage, whereas ATM is
a regulator of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints (5). Because
phosphorylation of H2AX and ATM are most closely associated
with recognition of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 6), it was
not expected that such pronounced responses would occur upon
nucleoside analogue exposure. It is now well-established that H2AX
is rapidly phosphorylated in response to additional forms of DNA
damage, such as single-stand breaks (SSB; ref. 7), stalled replication
forks (4, 8), and hyperthermia-induced stresses (9). The molecules
that are associated with the recognition and repair of ionizing
radiation–induced DNA damage have been well-characterized
and may offer insight into cellular responses to blocked DNA
replication.
The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is involved in the
cellular responses to DSBs and may also function during normal
DNA replication (10, 11). It is among the first responders to bind to
DNA ends (12, 13) and has been shown to tether DNA fragments
through the self-association of Rad50 coiled-coil domains (14).
Mre11 possesses 3¶!5¶ exonuclease and single-strand endonuclease activities (15, 16) and, therefore, potentially has the capability
to remove nucleoside analogues from DNA. The DNA damage
response is a highly regulated concert of many molecules in which
the MRN complex functions both upstream and downstream of
ATM. Here, we examined molecules that are known regulators of
the DSB response to determine if they recognize nucleoside
analogue–induced stalled replication forks and contribute to
survival.

Chemicals and antibodies. The nucleoside analogues, gemcitabine
and troxacitabine, were kindly provided by Dr. L. W. Hertel (Lilly Research
Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and Dr. Henriette Gourdeau (Biochem
Pharma, Montreal, Canada), respectively. The 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) used in these investigations was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were purchased from Upstate
Biotechnology (pSer139-H2AX, pSer1981-ATM), Abcam (ATM), Novus
Biologicals (Mre11), GeneTex (Rad50), Lab Vision (Ku70, Ku80), and
Sigma-Aldrich (h-actin). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from
Bethyl Laboratories (pSer139-H2AX) and Novus Biologicals (Nbs1). Alexa
Fluor 488, 594, and 680 fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased
from Molecular Probes.
Immunoblotting analysis. Cell lysate preparations and detection of
specific proteins were done according to previously described procedures
(4). The Odyssey IR imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences) was used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions for protein visualization.
DNA synthesis assay. Measurement of DNA synthesis was done as
previously described (4). Briefly, [3H]thymidine (5 ACi/mL, 60.9 Ci/mmol;
Moravek Biochemicals) was added 30 min before harvesting. Labeled cells
were collected on glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Scheull), and radioactivity
retained on the filter was determined by a liquid scintillation counter
(Packard).
Confocal microscopy. OCI-AML3 cultures were centrifuged onto slides,
fixed, and immunostained according to previously described procedures
(4). Images were obtained using an Olympus FluoView IX71 confocal

microscope system (Olympus) and processed using FluoView FV500 ver. 5
software. The objective lens was a 40/1.30 numerical aperature oil lens.
A profile of overlapping red and green fluorescence was measured by the
image processing and analysis software, ImageJ (NIH). Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (r) was calculated for each image using the Olympus FluoView
FV500 ver. 5 software.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed, and
stained with propidium iodide as previously described (4). At least 10,000
cells were evaluated for fluorescence using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur
flow cytometer.
Comet assay. OCI-AML3 cells were mixed with agarose, placed onto a
microscope slide, and assessed for DNA damage, as previously described
(20). Briefly, the slides were left in lysis solution for 1 h at 4jC in the dark,
washed twice with 1 Tris-borate EDTA buffer (neutral conditions) or
incubated in alkaline solution (pH >13) for 1 h, and subjected to
electrophoresis (300 mA) for 15 min at 4jC. Comet images analyzed by a
computer-based image analysis system (Kinetic Imaging Komet system,
Version 5.5) for tail moment, DNA content, and percentage of DNA in
the tail.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Exponentially growing cultures were
prelabeled with [14C]thymidine for 48 h (0.02 ACi/mL every 12 h  4),
exposed to drugs or ionizing radiation (3.17 Gy/min of 137Cs), and harvested
immediately. Cells were washed, embedded in agarose plugs, lysed, digested
with proteinase K, and the DNA was separated by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) using a CHEF-DR III system (Bio-Rad Laboratories),
as previously described (21). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide
and imaged using the ImageQuant software program (Molecular Dynamics).
Radioactivity was quantitated using the InstantImager system (PerkinElmer) after the gel had been dried at 60jC under vacuum.
siRNA transfections. AT22IJE-T+ATM cells were plated in 6-well plates
and incubated overnight. Medium was replaced with fresh medium

hours after transfection, cells were harvested and plated for clonogenic
survival assays. The remaining cells were lysed and subsequently examined
for protein knockdown by immunoblotting.
Clonogenic assays. Exponentially growing cultures were placed in a
6-well plate for 8 to 24 h before being exposed to the indicated drugs for
1 cell cycle period. Cells were then washed twice with PBS (37jC), fresh
medium was added, and allowed to grow undisturbed for 7 to 10 d in
normal growing conditions. Cells were fixed (50% methanol, 5% acetic acid,
45% H2O) for 1 h, stained with Accustain Giemsa (1:20 dilution; SigmaAldrich) for 1 h, and washed twice with water. Colonies of z50 cells were
counted using a dissecting microscope.

Results
Inhibition of DNA synthesis after exposure to nucleoside
analogues. The deoxycytidine nucleoside analogues, cytarabine
(ara-C), gemcitabine, and troxacitabine (Fig. 1A), were used to
cause stalled replication forks in the acute myelogenous leukemia
cell line, OCI-AML3. A range of nucleoside analogue concentrations
was first investigated to determine what concentrations of each
drug caused a similar inhibition of DNA replication (data not
shown). Exposure of 0.5 Amol/L ara-C, 0.1 Amol/L gemcitabine, or
2 Amol/L troxacitabine caused inhibition of DNA synthesis by
f70% within 1 h and 90% within 2 h, as measured by a decrease
in [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1B). The decrease in DNA
replication caused by drug incorporation into DNA was associated
with an accumulation of cells in S phase (>60%) within 24 h, as
determined by propidium iodide staining of DNA content (Fig. 1C).
These investigations show that the deoxycytidine nucleoside
analogues ara-C, gemcitabine, and troxacitabine are incorporated
into DNA, causing an early inhibition of DNA synthesis and
eventual arrest in S phase.
Colocalization of phosphorylated ATM and the MRN
complex at sites of nucleoside analogue–induced DNA
damage. The histone variant, H2AX, is rapidly phosphorylated
and forms distinct nuclear foci in response to many forms of DNA
damage, such as DSBs (22) and stalled replication forks (4, 8). We
investigated if other molecules that are important for the sensing
and repairing of DNA DSBs also accumulate at sites of nucleoside
analogue–induced stalled replication forks. Short drug incubations
were chosen to minimize the effect of DSBs possibly caused by the

collapse of replication forks. OCI-AML3 cultures exposed to ara-C,
gemcitabine, and troxacitabine, which caused an inhibition of
DNA synthesis by 90% within 2 h (Fig. 1B), showed an increase in
phosphorylation of Ser1981 on ATM (Fig. 2A). Distinct pSer1981-ATM
foci, which colocalized with g-H2AX, were evident within 2 hours of
exposure to all three nucleoside analogues, as analyzed by confocal
microscopy. Red-green profiles illustrate overlapping nuclear foci,
as depicted by overlapping red and green fluorescence peaks, for a
region in which a line was randomly drawn through the center of
a nucleus (Fig. 2A, bottom). Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)
was calculated for each image to determine the relationship
between phosphorylated ATM and g-H2AX, where one represents
100% correlation and zero for no correlation (Table 1; ref. 23). The
correlation of pSer1981-ATM and g-H2AX significantly (P < 0.001)
increased from 30% to 61% to 71% after nucleoside analogue
exposure, which was comparable with that found in cultures
treated with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation (74%; Table 1).
Further investigations showed that Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 form
nuclear foci in OCI-AML3 nuclei that also colocalize at sites of
stalled replication forks within 2 hours of exposure to nucleoside
analogues (Fig. 2B–D). An increased association of Rad50 and Nbs1
with g-H2AX was observed after exposure to these agents or
ionizing radiation, as determined by increased colocalization of
foci and Pearson’s coefficient (Fig. 2B–C; Table 1). DNA damage–
associated foci containing Mre11 and g-H2AX also increased after
exposure nucleoside analogues or ionizing radiation, suggesting an
Mre11 response (Fig. 2D). High levels of Mre11-associated
fluorescence was evident throughout the nuclei of untreated cells
(Fig. 2D, green) and likely explains a lack of an increase in Pearson’s
correlation coefficient between Mre11 and g-H2AX under all
conditions (Table 1). DNA damage–induced nuclear foci were
found in only a fraction of cells exposed to nucleoside analogues
(Fig. 2; data not shown), which is likely because these agents cause
stalled replication forks in cells actively undergoing DNA
replication (f35% of total cell population). Conversely, an increase
in DNA damage foci was evident in a majority of cells after ionizing
radiation treatment, which is not cell cycle specific (Fig. 2A–D,
right). A similar response was previously reported for g-H2AX
(4). Although ara-C, gemcitabine, and troxacitabine have slightly
different overall mechanisms of action (2), differences in colocalization

DNA Damage Response to Stalled Replication Forks

was not dependent on the agent used. These experiments show
that molecules that are closely associated with the DSB response
also colocalize at sites of nucleoside analogue–induced stalled
replication forks.
Undetectable levels of DNA breaks caused by nucleoside
analogues. We investigated if the molecular response to nucleoside analogue–induced DNA damage was associated with the
presence of DSBs because the functions of ATM, H2AX, and the
MRN complex are most closely associated with the sensing, signaling, and repair of these lesions. OCI-AML3 cultures were exposed
to nucleoside analogues or ionizing radiation and examined for
the presence of DSBs by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Cultures exposed to nucleoside analogues for 2 hours showed
similar levels of DSB induction compared with untreated controls,
as determined by both fluorescence (Fig. 3A, top) and [14C]labeling of DNA (Fig. 3A, bottom). Conversely, 10 to 40 Gy of ionizing radiation caused a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in DSB detection.
Because the number of DSBs caused by 10 Gy of ionizing radiation
approached the lower limit of detection using PFGE, cells were
further examined by the comet assay under both neutral and
alkaline conditions, as a potentially more sensitive method to
measure DSBs and SSBs, respectively. Similar to PFGE experiments,
OCI-AML3 cultures exposed to nucleoside analogues for 2 hours
did not show increased levels of either DSBs (Fig. 3B) or SSBs
(Fig. 3C), compared with untreated controls. Conversely, 10 Gy of
ionizing radiation caused an increase in mean tail moment of 2- to
3-fold (neutral conditions) and 13-fold (alkaline conditions), which
likely represents the measurement of DNA damage caused by
f400 DSBs per cell (24). The limit of sensitivity for the comet assay
has been estimated at f50 strand breaks per diploid mammalian
cell (25). As there are opportunities for nucleoside analogues
to incorporate into an estimated 100,000 replication forks
throughout S phase, in which 10% are engaged in DNA synthesis
at any one time (26, 27), it does not seem likely that the molecular
response seen under these conditions (Fig. 2) is due to the presence
of DNA breaks.
The contribution of DNA damage sensor and repair
molecules to survival. ATM, H2AX, Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 play
important roles in sensing and repairing DSBs (10). Deficiencies in
these DNA damage response molecules cause increased sensitivity
to ionizing radiation (19, 28–31), implying that their functions
relate to survival with regard to DSBs. To determine if these
proteins contribute to survival after the formation of stalled
replication forks, we analyzed cell lines that are deficient or have
decreased levels of ATM, Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, or H2AX for their
sensitivity to a nucleoside analogue. When immortalized AT
fibroblasts deficient for ATM (Fig. 4A) were exposed to gemcitabine, a significant difference in reproductive viability (P < 0.001)
was observed, compared with the repleted line. Exposure of
10 nmol/L gemcitabine for 24 hours before drug removal killed 70%
of AT cells, whereas <10% of ATM-repleted cells lost repopulation
capacity (Fig. 4A, middle). A 4.8-fold difference in gemcitabine
sensitivity was observed between AT and AT+ATM cultures after
exposure to a range of gemcitabine concentrations, as determined
by IC50 values (Fig. 4A, bottom). These results are consistent with a
previous report that showed a 2-fold increase in sensitivity to
gemcitabine after ATM knockdown using siRNA in A549 and HeLa
cells (32).

siRNA, a 35% to 50% decrease in clonogenic survival was observed
when cells were exposed to 10 nmol/L gemcitabine, compared with
siRNA controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 4B, bottom). When exposed to a
range of gemcitabine concentrations, an approximate 2-fold
increase in gemcitabine sensitivity was calculated in Mre11- and
Rad50-depleted cells, as determined by calculated IC50 values
(Fig. 4C–D). Consistent with other reports (33, 34), a decrease in
Mre11 protein caused by siRNA also led to a reduction in Rad50
(85%) and Nbs1 (40%), suggesting that Mre11 contributes to Rad50
and Nbs1 protein stability (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S1). Decreases in Mre11 did not affect protein levels of other DNA damage
sensors, Ku70 or Ku80 (Fig. 4B, top). Neither the Mre11 nor the
Nbs1 protein was affected after knockdown of Rad50 (data not
shown).
Immortalized NBS fibroblasts, which lack Nbs1 but were
proficient for Mre11 and Rad50, did not show a difference in
gemcitabine sensitivity, compared with Nbs1-repleted cultures

(Fig. 5A). The lack of increased sensitivity was confirmed by using
Nbs1-targeted siRNA in AT+ATM cultures (Fig. 5B). Although Nbs1
has been reported to be required for the S-phase checkpoint in
response to UV irradiation, ionizing radiation, and hydroxyurea
(35, 36), Nbs1-deficient cells exposed to nucleoside analogues
arrested in S phase at similar concentrations as the paired Nbs1proficient cell line (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, immortalized
H2AX/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts were not sensitized to
gemcitabine (Fig. 5C). This result supports previous data that the
DNA damage response after nucleoside analogue exposure was not
due to the presence of DSBs (Fig. 3), as an increase in sensitivity is
expected under DSB conditions (19). Figure 5D summarizes the
IC50 values, 95% confidence intervals, and fold differences in
gemcitabine sensitivity for all cell lines. This investigation shows
that ATM, Mre11, and Rad50, but not Nbs1 and H2AX, contribute
to cell survival and recovery from gemcitabine-induced stalled
replication forks.

Discussion
ATM and the MRN complex are critical to sensing DSBs and
initiating repair of damaged DNA. They may also function during
DNA replication (11). Here, we report that these molecules respond
to stalled replication forks, and that ATM, Mre11, and Rad50 are
required for survival after such agitation. A previous study, showed
a similar increase in sensitivity after depletion of ATR, which is a
known regulator of the DNA damage response to stalled replication

forks (32). However, the relationship between ATR and the DNA
damage response molecules investigated here is not well-understood. Nbs1 and H2AX are not likely critically involved in the
response to stalled replication forks because their absence did not
affect reproductive viability (Fig. 5). It has been reported that Nbs1
is required for the S and G2-M cell cycle checkpoints in response
to UV irradiation, hydroxyurea, or ionizing radiation (35, 36).
However, we did not find that Nbs1 was required for a nucleoside

analogue–induced S-phase arrest (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the molecular sensors investigated here likely have damagespecific functions and contribute to cell survival after inhibition
of DNA synthesis by a different mechanism than signaling for cell
cycle arrest. Differences may be due to the mechanisms that cause
stalled replication forks. Nucleoside analogues physically block
DNA synthesis of extending DNA strands, whereas UV and
hydroxyurea cause fork stalling by other means. Because Nbs1
was not required for survival under these conditions, it is not clear
if Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 function as a complex, as they do after
DSBs, or individually in response to stalled replication forks.
A variety of human disorders are associated with depleted ATM,
Mre11, or Nbs1, including AT, AT-like disorder, and NBS (5, 34,
37, 38). Patients with these disorders display similar characteristics
of cancer susceptibility, extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation,
and neurologic defects. These phenotypes indicate that ATM,
Mre11, and Nbs1 may play a role in normal DNA replication (11).
In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that Mre11 is
required to prevent DSBs during normal chromosomal replication
in Xenopus eggs extract (39). Furthermore, Mre11 associates with
chromatin in an S phase–specific manner and localizes to sites of
ongoing DNA replication in human fibroblasts, as visualized by
proliferating cell nuclear antigen and incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (40). The results reported here extend the functions of ATM,
Mre11, and Rad50 to promoting cell survival in response to blocked
DNA extension of nascent strands.
Although evidence supports that nucleoside analogues incorporate into DNA and exert a cytotoxic effect by blocking DNA
synthesis (Fig. 1; ref. 2), we sought to confirm that the molecular
response observed here was not due to the presence of DNA
breaks. Although the assays were sensitive enough to detect DSBs
caused by ionizing radiation, these lesions were not measurable
after nucleoside analogue exposure (Fig. 3). It is estimated that 1 Gy
of ionizing radiation causes 40 DSBs per cell, resulting in a similar
number of g-H2AX nuclear foci (24). The same 1:1 ratio is not likely
true in response to agents that cause stalled replication forks. An
estimated 50,000 replication origins containing two forks each are
brought together to form many replication factories at the start of
replication in human cells (41, 42). Therefore, it is likely that the
number of DNA damage nuclear foci observed here represent
replication factories containing many stalled replication forks.
These factories are stably anchored in the nucleus but changes in
the patterns occur during coordinated assembly and disassembly
throughout S phase (43). The pattern that forms after nucleoside
analogue exposure resembles similar patterns reported previously

during early S phase DNA replication (Fig. 2; refs. 44, 45),
supporting our earlier finding that H2AX phosphorylation first
occurs after nucleoside analogue treatment in cells initiating DNA
synthesis (4).
The DNA repair mechanisms involved in removing nucleoside
analogues from DNA are not well-understood. Proof-reading 3¶!5¶
exonuclease activities associated with replicative DNA polymerases (46) and base excision repair processes (47) are capable
of removing fraudulent nucleotides from DNA. However, a slow
rate of drug removal (48) and sustained cell cycle arrest after
exposure to nucleoside analogues (49) suggests that these
mechanisms do not significantly promote survival. It is unknown
what role ATM, Mre11, and Rad50 play at replication forks when
DNA synthesis is inhibited. These molecules may have replication
fork surveillance or DNA repair mechanisms that respond to
chemotherapeutic agent–induced replication blocking and, thus,
contribute to drug resistance. Because Mre11 possesses 3¶!5¶
exonuclease and single strand endonuclease activities (15, 16), it
may have the capacity to remove nucleoside analogues from
DNA. Excision kinetics are enhanced when Mre11 is coupled with
Rad50 (15), which may offer an explanation for the increase in
gemcitabine sensitivity observed in Rad50-depleted cultures
(Fig. 4). Simplified models using purified enzymes/enzyme
complexes, oligonucleotides, and primer extension assays may
be useful to answer these questions and may uncover a novel
mechanism for the removal of nucleoside analogues from DNA,
which is currently poorly understood (50).
Here, we present mechanistic evidence for the importance of a
DNA repair pathway not previously known to be required for
survival after the induction of stalled replication forks. These
results provide a rationale for further studies to determine the
mechanisms by which these molecules contribute to survival.
