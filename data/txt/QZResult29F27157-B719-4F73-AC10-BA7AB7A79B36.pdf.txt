Nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC1), a nuclear factor belonging to the BTB/POZ gene family, is known
to play important roles in proliferation and growth of tumor cells and in chemotherapy resistance.
Yet, the mechanisms underlying how NAC1 contributes to drug resistance remain largely unclear.
We reported here that autophagy was involved in NAC1-mediated resistance to cisplatin, a
commonly used chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of ovarian cancer. We found that
treatment with cisplatin caused an activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780,
OVCAR3, and SKOV3. We further demonstrated that knockdown of NAC1 by RNAi or
inactivation of NAC1 by inducing the expression of a NAC1 deletion mutant that contains only
the BTB/POZ domain significantly inhibited the cisplatin-induced autophagy, resulting in
increased cisplatin cytotoxicity. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy and sensitization to cisplatin
by NAC1 knockdown or inactivation were accompanied by induction of apoptosis. To confirm
that the sensitizing effect of NAC1 inhibition on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin was attributed to
suppression of autophagy, we assessed the effects of the autophagy inhibitors, 3-MA and
chloroquine, and siRNAs targeting beclin 1 or Atg5, on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. Treatment
with 3-MA, chloroquine or beclin 1 and Atg5-targeted siRNA also enhanced the sensitivity of

SKOV3, A2780 and OVCAR3 cells to cisplatin, indicating that suppression of autophagy indeed
renders tumor cells more sensitive to cisplatin. Regulation of autophagy by NAC1 was mediated
via high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), as the functional status of NAC1 was associated with the
expression, translocation and release of HMGB1. The results of our study not only revealed a new
mechanism determining cisplatin sensitivity, but also identified NAC1 as a novel regulator of
autophagy. Thus, the NAC1- mediated autophagy may be exploited as a new target for enhancing
the efficacy of cisplatin against ovarian cancer and other types of malignancies.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Nucleus accumbens-1 (NAC1), a transcription repressor that belongs to the BTB/POZ gene
family, has been found to be overexpressed in several types of human carcinomas arising
from ovary, cervix, endometrium, breast, and colon (Nakayama et al., 2006a; Nakayama et
al., 2006b; Yeasmin et al., 2008). The highly conserved BTB/POZ domain is required for
NAC1 homodimerization, and the formation of the homodimer complex participates in
various biological functions, such as transcription regulation, protein degradation via
ubiquitination, cell proliferation, apoptosis. It has been observed in patients with ovarian
cancer that expression of NAC1 is significantly higher in recurrent post-treatment tumors
than in untreated specimens (Davidson et al., 2007; Nakayama et al., 2006a; Nakayama et
al., 2006b), and the up-regulation of NAC1 in human cancers contributes to tumor growth
and survival, and to resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel (Jinawath
et al., 2009; Nakayama et al., 2006b). Additionally, NACC1 that encodes NAC1 is amplified
in many ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas. These studies suggest that NAC1 not only
possesses oncogenic potential, but is also involved in modulation of drug resistance.

Cisplatin is a platinum compound commonly used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, one of
the most lethal malignancies in women. However, development of resistance to cisplatin
during the therapy often limits the effectiveness of this drug in treating patients with ovarian
cancer. A diverse array of mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been reported, including
decreased intracellular accumulation of the drug, increased repair of DNA damage, reduced
apoptosis (Borst et al., 2008), and involvement of certain enzymes such as mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphatase (Ren et al.; Wang et al., 2007). Recently, induction of
autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved response to nutrient deprivation found in yeast,
plants, worms, flies, mice and man, has been suggested to be potentially involved in cellular
resistance to cisplatin (Harhaji-Trajkovic et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009; PeriyasamyThandavan et al., 2008). Autophagy is a process of self-digestion of cytoplasm and
organelles through which cellular components are recycled for energy utilization. Recent
studies have shown that autophagy is also a response to certain forms of therapeutic stress
including cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Livesey et al., 2009; White and
DiPaola, 2009). Nevertheless, the exact roles of autophagy in determining sensitivity of
tumor cells to various treatments remain undefined, and many studies imply that it is

context-dependent. For cisplatin, how autophagy induced by this chemotherapeutic drug
affects its efficacy and the mechanism by which autophagy is regulated in cancer cells
treated with this agent are largely unknown.

Based on the pro-survival role of NAC1 and its involvement in resistance to chemotherapy,
in this study we sought to investigate: 1) the effect of NAC1 expression or functional status
on cisplatin sensitivity; 2) whether NAC1 was involved in regulation of autophagy; 3)
whether the pro-survival function of NAC1 was attributed to induction of autophagy. We
demonstrate that NAC1 is a regulator of autophagy in cancer cells, and the regulation of
autophagy by NAC1 is mediated through its effects on the expression, translocation, and
release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an important regulator of autophagy (Tang
et al.). Our study also reveals that cisplatin-activated autophagy protects tumor cells against
the cytotoxicity of this agent, and that inhibition of NAC1 and autophagy can enhance
sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. Thus, NAC1 may represent a novel
therapeutic target for reinforcing the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy.

Cisplatin induces a cyto-protective autophagy in ovarian cancer cells

To determine the effect of cisplatin on autophagy and the role of autophagy in determining
the sensitivity of cancer cells to this drug, we first examined the activity of autophagy in
ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of the human
ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and OVCAR3 with cisplatin caused a dose-dependent
activation of autophagy, as evidenced by the increases in the amount of LC3 II and
decreases in the amount of p62, two selective markers of autophagy. Fig. 1A also shows that
LC3 II levels were further elevated in the presence of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of
autophagosomelysosome fusion and LC3 II degradation, indicating an increase of
autophagic flux in the cisplatin-treated cancer cells. The stimulative effect of cisplatin on
autophagy was verified by a GFP-LC3 puncta formation assay, which demonstrated an
increase in the number of GFP-LC3 puncta in the tumor cells treated with cisplatin (Fig.
1B). Next, we determined whether the cisplatin-stimulated autophagy played a protective or
sensitizing role in tumor cells treated with this drug. We found that in comparison to
treatment with cisplatin alone, co-treatment of ovarian cancer cells with cisplatin and
inhibitors of autophagy, 3-MA or chloroquine, enhanced the cytotoxicity (Fig. 2A) and
apoptosis (Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C) induced by cisplatin. To further prove the role of autophagy
in determining sensitivity of tumor cells to cisplatin, we suppressed autophagy by silencing
the expression of autophagy-related genes beclin 1 or Atg5, and then measured the effects of
inhibiting autophagic activity on clonogenicity of the tumor cells. Fig. 2D shows that
knockdown of beclin 1 or Atg5 in A2780 and OVCAR3 cells significantly reinforced the
colony-inhibitory effect of cisplatin. These results suggest that cisplatin induces a canonical
autophagy, and induction of autophagy plays a protective role in tumor cells subjected to the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin.

NAC1 is essential for the cisplatin-activated autophagy

Overexpression of NAC1 in ovarian cancer and several other types of carcinomas has been
reported to be correlative with tumor recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy.
Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which NAC1 promotes survival of tumor cell and confers
resistance to chemotherapy remain largely unclear. As autophagy was shown to play a
prosurvival role in tumor cells treated with cisplatin (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), we asked whether or
not there was an association between the function of NAC1 and activity of autophagy. We
first used a SKOV3 cell line in which an inducible (Tet-Off) expression construct of a
NAC1 deletion mutant (N130) was introduced (Nakayama et al., 2006b). In this cell line
(SKOV3/N130), expression of the NAC1 mutant is repressed when doxycycline is present;
however, upon removal of doxycycline, the expression of this mutant is activated
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S1; Fig. 3A, upper panel), and when expressed on its own
the first 130 amino acid of NAC1 have the ability to exert a dominant negative effect and
inactivate the NAC1 protein, since NAC1 needs to homodimerize through the BTB/POZ
domain to be functionally active. Fig. 3A shows that in the cisplatin-treated SKOV3/N130
cells, activation of the expression of the NAC1 deletion mutant by removal of doxycycline
led to suppression of autophagic response, as compared to autophagy in the cells with
deactivation of the expression of NAC1 mutant in the presence of doxycycline. To further
prove the role of NAC1 in inducing autophagy, we silenced the expression of NAC1 in
A2780 and OVCAR3 cells followed by treatment with cisplatin, and then examined the
level of autophagy. Fig. 3B demonstrates that silencing of NAC1 expression partially
blocked the autophagic response activated by cisplatin, as compared to the non-targeted
control. The effect of NAC1 on cisplatin-activated autophagy was also demonstrated by a
GFP-LC3 puncta formation assay and by electron microscopy, showing that inactivation or
silencing of NAC1 expression decreased the numbers of GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 3C) and the
numbers of autophagosomes (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NAC1 plays an essential
role in mediating the autophagy induction by cisplatin treatment.
Inhibition of NAC1 enhances sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of NAC1 on cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, we treated the ovarian
cancer cell lines harboring different status of NAC1 with a series of concentrations of
cisplatin. At the end of 48 h treatment, cellular viability was measured using a MTT assay.
Fig. 4A shows that inactivation of NAC1 either by inducing the expression of a NAC1
deletion mutant or by silencing of NAC1 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin in tumor cells, as compared to that in the cells expressing wild-type
NAC1 or non-targeting siRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inactivation or silencing
of NAC1 significantly augmented the cisplatin-induced apoptosis, as indicated by increases
in Annexin V staining and in the amounts of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4B and Fig.
4C). Suppression of autophagy and activation of apoptosis by inhibiting NAC1 in the
cisplatin-treated cells suggest a regulatory role for NAC1 in the cross-talk between
autophagy and apoptosis.

Regulation of autophagy by NAC1 is mediated by HMGB1

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In quantitative proteomic analyses of proteins that are potentially regulated by NAC1, we
observed that when NAC1 status was switched from inactive state to active state in SKOV3/
N130 cells, there was a ~2-fold increase in the amount of HMGB1 protein, an important
regulator of autophagy. Thus, we next explored whether or not HMGB1 could be a mediator
of the NAC1-activated autophagy. In these experiments, we knocked down the expression of
HMGB1 in ovarian cancer cells with active NAC1 function, and then treated these cells with
cisplatin. Knockdown of HMGB1 either in SKOV3/N130 cells cultured in the presence of
doxycycline or in the parental OVCAR3 and A2780 cells resulted in blunting of cisplatininduced autophagy, as demonstrated by a decrease in the amount of LC3 II and an increase
in p62, in comparison to that in the cells without knockdown of HMGB1 (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of HMGB1 in these cells also led to increased apoptosis in the cisplatin-treated cells,
as indicated by an elevated level of cleaved PARP (Fig. 5B). These results suggest a key
role for HMGB1 in mediating the NAC1-activated autophagy.
NAC1 modulates the expression, translocation, and release of HMGB1

Author Manuscript

Since HMGB1 was shown to be required for the NAC1-regulated autophagy in the cisplatintreated cells (Fig. 5), we next determined the effects of NAC1 on the expression,
translocation, and release of HMGB1. Fig. 6 shows that in both the cisplatin-treated and
non-treated cells, inactivation or silencing of NAC1 led to a decrease in the expression of
HMGB1. Cisplatin treatment reduced the amount of HMGB1 in the nuclei but increased
HMGB1 protein in the cytoplasm of the cells with active NAC1 function (Fig. 6), indicating
that this agent causes cytosolic translocation of HMGB1. Notably, inhibition of NAC1
blocked the cytosolic translocation of HMGB1 in these ovarian cancer cells treated with
cisplatin (Fig. 6). Cisplatin-induced release of HMGB1 was also suppressed by NAC1
inhibition (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the functional status of NAC1 impacts the
expression, translocation, and release of HMGB1 in tumor cells under stresses such as
cytotoxic insults.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study we report a previously unrecognized role of NAC1 in regulating autophagy,
and provide a possible mechanistic role for how NAC1 up-regulation, as observed in several
types of human cancer, contributes to tumor progression and early recurrence in patients
after chemotherapy as previously reported. We show that treatment with the
chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin activates autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 1), and
inactivation and gene silencing of NAC1 blocks the activation of autophagy by cisplatin
(Fig. 3). We further demonstrate that regulation of autophagy by NAC1 is mediated through
its effect on HMGB1, as the functional status of NAC1 affects the expression, translocation,
and release of this critical autophagy regulator (Fig. 6), which is known to induce autophagy
by disrupting the interaction between beclin 1 and bcl-2 (Tang D et al 2010).
Because tumor recurrence as a result of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs remains a
formidable problem in managing cancer patients, the results from this study should
illuminate fundamental properties of chemo-resistance and provide new therapeutic targets

to treat advanced recurrent neoplastic diseases. The role of NAC1 in activation of
autophagy, a cellular process of self-digestion in response to various stresses, may account,
at least in part, for the prosurvival function of this cancer-associated protein. Indeed,
autophagy has been appreciated as an important mechanism for conferring resistance to
chemotherapy. For instance, it has been shown that induction of autophagy promotes
resistance of leukemic cells to adriamycin and vincristine (Liu et al.). Similarly, we
demonstrate here that cisplatin-induced autophagy protects ovarian cancer cells from the
cytotoxic effects of cisplatin (Fig. 2). It has been known that cisplatin induces autophagy in
various types of cells (Fanzani et al.; Kaushal et al., 2008; Ren et al.), but how autophagy
contributes to cellular sensitivity to this drug remains to be clarified. Several studies have
shown that activation of autophagy in the cisplatin-treated cells inhibited apoptosis and
protected cells from cisplatin toxicity (Harhaji-Trajkovic et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009;
Periyasamy-Thandavan et al., 2008; Ren et al.). In contrast, there are also studies reporting
that forced expression of Beclin 1, a key autophagy gene, activates both autophagy and
apoptosis, and potentiates the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on tumor cells (Sun et al.). We
demonstrate here that autophagy induced by cisplatin is cyto-protective, as suppression of
autophagy by inhibiting NAC1 or by using small molecule inhibitors of autophagy augments
the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). Therefore, it is likely that the functional
consequences of activating autophagy are context-dependent, and factors such as cell type
and treatment regimen could all determine the fates of autophagic cells for their survival or
death. Additionally, we observed a similar effect of NAC1 on autophagy that was induced
by other stimuli (nutrient depletion, hypoxia or rapamycin treatment) in ovarian cancer cells
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S2) and in other types of cells treated with cisplatin
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S3, Fig. S4 and Fig. S5), suggesting that NAC1 may act
as an autophagy regulator in various types of tumor cells responding to multiple forms of
stress.

Author Manuscript

Regulation of autophagy by NAC1 appears to be mediated through HMGB1, a highly
conserved chromatin-associated nuclear protein and an extracellular signaling molecule that
is now appreciated as a critical regulator of autophagy and apoptosis by acting as an inducer
of autophagy and a suppressor of apoptosis (Ellerman et al., 2007; Tang et al.). The
expression or function of HMGB1 has been reported to be closely linked to cancer
development and progression (Ellerman et al., 2007). Although the expression of HMGB1 is
activated in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells (Nagatani et al., 2001), the actual effects of this
protein on cellular sensitivity to cisplatin vary in different cell types (He et al., 2000;
Sharma et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2003). We show that the expression, translocation, and
release of HMGB1 are altered by the functional status of NAC1 (Fig. 6), which is also
demonstrated to modulate the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin via autophagy
(Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Thus, it is likely that the effect of HMGB1 on cisplatin sensitivity could
be dependent on the functional status of NAC1 in an individual cell type. At present, the
precise mechanism by which NAC1 controls the expression, translocation and release of
HMGB1 is unknown; however, considering that NAC1 predominantly localizes in the nuclei
(Supplementary Information, Fig. S6) and its role as a transcription factor, it is likely that
NAC1 activates the transcription of HMGB1, leading to increased expression, translocation
and release of HMGB1. The possibility that NAC1 assists HMGB1 in nucleo-cytoplasmic

shuttling is also worth investigating. Note worthily, the release of HMGB1 can also be
regulated by autophagy, as reported by Thorburn et al. (Thorburn et al., 2009a; Thorburn et
al., 2009b). It is conceivable that the increased amount of cytoplasmic HMGB1 activates
autophagy, since HMGB1 is known to modulate autophagy by disrupting the interaction
between beclin 1 and bcl-2 in the cytoplasm (Tang D et al 2010). In addition, consistent with
the role of HMGB1 in balancing autophagy and apoptosis, our results show that silencing of
HMGB1 not only inhibits autophagy but also activates apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells
subjected to cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5). As reduced apoptosis is believed to be one of the
mechanisms of cisplatin resistance, the converse relationship between autophagy and
apoptosis in tumor cells treated with cisplatin, as shown in this study, might also help
explain why apoptosis is suppressed in cisplatin-resistant cells.

Author Manuscript

Development of drug resistance is a complex process involving multiple genes and the
pathways they control. It is most likely that NAC1 participates in chemo-resistance through
several other mechanisms besides mediating autophagy. For example, NAC1 has been
reported to inactivate the Gadd45 tumor suppressor pathway that is activated by
chemotherapeutic compounds (Jinawath et al., 2009; Nakayama et al., 2007). Thus, NAC1expressing tumor cells should have a survival advantage in the presence of cytotoxic drugs.
Moreover, NAC1 has been found to play a role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic
stem cells by transcriptionally regulating gene expression of other pluripotency-associated
factors including Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Sall1 and Sall4 (Kim et al., 2008; Muller et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2006). As exportation of foreign compounds such as cytotoxic drugs is
an inherent feature of stem cells, it is possible that cancer cells with NAC1 up-regulation
may adopt a similar strategy as embryonic stem cells to survive during chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our study identified NAC1 as a novel regulator of autophagy and its
involvement in modulation of cisplatin sensitivity, and demonstrated that inhibition of
NAC1 can enhance sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to this chemotherapeutic drug. These
findings may expand current knowledge of the autophagic protein networks and provide
new insight into how autophagy is regulated in tumor cells. Thus, NAC1 might be explored
as a novel therapeutic target for prevention of tumor cells from becoming resistance to
chemotherapy and for reinforcement of the efficacy of cisplatin against malignant tumors.

(A) A2780 and OVCAR3 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of cisplatin for
24 h in the absence or presence of 10 nM of bafilomycin A1. At the end of treatment, cell
lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using
anti-LC3, anti-p62 or anti-tubulin antibodies, respectively. Tubulin was used as a loading
control. (B) A2780 and OVCAR3 cells were transfected with a GFP-LC3 plasmid, followed
by treatment with the indicated concentrations of cisplatin for 24 h. At the end of treatment,
the cells were inspected under a fluorescence microscope. Quantitation of the GFP-LC3
puncta was performed by counting 20 cells for each sample, and average numbers of puncta
per cell were shown. The bars are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations; results
shown are the representative of three identical experiments. ** p < 0.01, t-test, cisplatin vs.
