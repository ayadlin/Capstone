ABSTRACT
Both microtubule and topoisomerase II (Top2) are important anticancer targets
and their respective inhibitors are widely used in combination for cancer therapy.
However, some combinations could be mutually antagonistic and drug resistance
further limits their therapeutic efficacy. Here we report YCH337, a novel α-carboline
derivative that targets both microtubule and Top2, eliciting tumor proliferation and
growth inhibition and overcoming drug resistance. YCH337 inhibited microtubule
polymerization by binding to the colchicine site and subsequently led to mitotic
arrest. It also suppressed Top2 and caused DNA double-strand breaks. It disrupted
microtubule more potently than Top2. YCH337 induced reversible mitotic arrest at
low concentrations but persistent DNA damage. YCH337 caused intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis and decreased MCL-1, cIAP1 and XIAP proteins. In this aspect, YCH337
behaved differently from the combination of vincristine and etoposide. YCH337
inhibited proliferation of tumor cells with an averaged IC50 of 0.3 μM. It significantly
suppressed the growth of HT-29 xenografts in nude mice too. Importantly, YCH337
nearly equally killed different-mechanism-mediated resistant tumor cells and
corresponding parent cells. Together with the novelty of its chemical structure,
YCH337 could serve as a promising lead for drug development and a prototype for a
dual microtubule/Top2 targeting strategy for cancer therapy.

the mitotic spindle assembly. Consequently, cells are
arrested in M phase, causing proliferative inhibition or even
cell killing [5]. Tubulin inhibitors can be roughly classified
into microtubule stabilizers (e.g., taxanes) and destabilizers
[e.g., Vinca alkaloids] [6]. Taxanes bind to the paclitaxel
site and promote microtubule polymerization while
Vinca alkaloids bind to the vinblastine site and accelerate
depolymerization. Both have been extensively used in
the clinic. There are other microtubule destabilizers such
as combretastatin A4 (CA4) that bind to the colchicine

INTRODUCTION
Both microtubule and topoisomerase II (Top2) are
important anticancer targets and their respective inhibitors
have been widely used for cancer therapy [1–4]. Microtubule
consists of microtubulin. The dynamic equilibrium between
polymerization and depolymerization of microtubulin
precisely regulates the function of microtubule [3].
Interference with this balance by promoting polymerization
or depolymerization disrupts microtubule and thus impairs

site to depolymerize microtubule, which are undergoing
clinical trials [7]. In contrast, Top2, a nuclear enzyme, is
critical for resolving DNA entanglement and for segregating
chromosomes in mitosis [8]. Top2 catalytically cleaves the
DNA duplex and mediates the passage of its one segment
through another. This process generates transient Top2DNA covalent complexes (Top2cc) and DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB) that are normally rapidly repaired.
Stabilizing the Top2cc results in the accumulation of DSB,
which activates DNA damage response, subsequently leads
to G1, S and/or G2 arrest and induces apoptosis. This is
the basic mechanism of action of Top2 poisons (e.g.,
podophyllotoxins and anthracyclines), the most important
subclass of Top2 inhibitors in the clinic [9].
Microtubule inhibitors and Top2 inhibitors are
frequently used in combination for cancer therapy.
Many therapeutic regimens contain vincristine (VCR),
vinblastine, paclitaxel or docetaxel in combination
with doxorubicin (DX) or etoposide (VP-16) for the
treatment of various hematological or solid tumors [4].
These combinations have been reported not only to
produce synergistic therapeutic effects but also to reduce
nonhematologic toxicities [10]. However, there are
also findings that improper combinations, for example,
colchicine plus VP-16, might elicit antagonistic effects
or enhance toxicities [11, 12]. Therefore, how to choose
correct drug combinations and take proper sequential
approaches becomes an important issue, the resolution to
which remains largely empirical at present. Another issue
is tumor drug resistance [13]. The use of microtubule
inhibitors and Top2 inhibitors frequently leads to
multidrug resistance (MDR) that is mediated usually by
overexpressed drug transporters [14, 15]. Importantly,
these MDR tumor cells are usually cross-resistant to both
of them, causing treatment failures even when used in
combination [11, 16, 17]. In contrast, mutations of the
drug binding sites on microtubule or Top2 might also
result in resistance, generally, only to their respective
inhibitors (i.e., individual drug resistance, IDR) by
reducing the effective drug binding. In this case, tumor
cells resistant to Top2 inhibitors could still be sensitive
to microtubule inhibitors and vice versa. For this reason,

their combination is likely to delay the emergence of drug
resistance or even combat it to some degree.
However, few single agents have been reported
as yet to concomitantly inhibit microtubule and Top2.
Theoretically, such agents could cause similar therapeutic
efficacy as the combination of the two classes of inhibitors
but make the drug choice and administration simpler and
easier. Moreover, these agents could also overcome IDR
or even MDR as described above, and thus achieve more
persistent therapeutic effects. Here we show such a strategy
of dual targeting of microtubule and Top2 to achieve
anticancer effects, as exemplified by a single compound
YCH337. This novel microtubule/Top2 inhibitor was shown
to inhibit both microtubule and Top2, result in microtubule
depolymerization and DSB, subsequently lead to mitotic
arrest and apoptosis and finally elicit tumor proliferation
and growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. YCH337 was
also revealed to kill both MDR and IDR tumor cells and
their respective parent cells to an equivalent degree. In
addition, we found that YCH337 behaved differently from
the combination of the microtubule inhibitor VCR and the
Top2 inhibitor VP-16, particularly in inducing apoptosis.

RESULTS
YCH337 inhibits microtubule polymerization by
binding to the colchicine site, leading to spindle
assembly disruption
YCH337 {(2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl) (9Hpyrido [2,3-b] indol-3-yl) methanone} [18] (Figure 1),
a novel α-carboline derivative, was shown to cause
cellular microtubule depolymerization (Figure 2A). It
also inhibited tubulin polymerization in a concentrationdependent manner in a cell-free system (Figure 2B).
Consistently, the treatment of HeLa cells with YCH337
increased the fraction of free tubulin (in supernatant)
but decreased the fraction of polymerized tubulin (in
precipitate), without changing the level of total tubulin
(Figure 2C). Similar to the colchicine-site binder
CA4, YCH337 competitively reduced the binding of
colchicine to tubulin, but did not affect the binding of

apoptosis (marked by the sub-G1 peak) at the 48-h time
point (Figure 4H). However, the 12-h pretreatments
of HeLa cells with enhanced concentrations (0.5 μM
or 1 μM) of YCH337 led to irreversible M arrest and
subsequent cell death (Supplementary Figure S2). The
data indicate that YCH337 induces reversible M arrest at a
relatively low concentration; but even at as low as 0.2 μM,
it elicits the effect of persistent Top2 inhibition and DSB.

YCH337 apparently decreased pBR322 DNA
relaxation mediated by Top2 (Figure 3A) rather than
Top1 (Figure 3B) in cell-free systems. The treatment
with YCH337 led to DSB in a concentration- (Figure
3C) or time- (Figure 3D) dependent manner, as revealed
by the progressive increase in the levels of γH2AX [a
well-documented molecular marker of DSB [19]] in
HeLa cells. At single-cell levels, YCH337 also caused
not only microtubule depolymerization but also the
formation of γH2AX foci (Figure 3E). In contrast, the
classical tubulin inhibitors only affected microtubule
polymerization (Supplementary Figure S1). Noticeably,
cellular microtubule depolymerization occurred as early
as 15 min in the cells treated with 1 μM YCH337 (Figure
3E, a versus b) or at as low as 0.1 μM in the cells treated
with YCH337 for 1 h (Figure 3E, a versus c). In those
corresponding cells, however, the γH2AX foci began
to form at 30 min or at 0.2 μM (Figure 3E). These data
indicate that YCH337 is a dual tubulin/Top2 inhibitor, but
its microtubule depolymerization is more potent than its
Top2 inhibition.

YCH337 induces apoptosis, different from
that elicited by the combination of the tubulin
inhibitor VCR and the Top2 inhibitor VP-16
Persistent mitotic arrest or DNA damage can trigger
apoptosis [24–26] through intrinsic and/or extrinsic
pathways [27]. The treatment with YCH337 caused loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HeLa
cells in a time-dependent manner (Figure 5A and 5B). The
treatment further resulted in the activation of caspase-8,
caspase-9 and caspase-3 and the cleavage of PARP in
concentration- and time-dependent manners (Figure 5C).
The BCL-2 family proteins such as BCL-2 and MCL-1
regulate both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by changing
the mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization [28–
31]. Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins including cIAP1
and XIAP are negative regulators of caspases [32, 33].
YCH337 apparently reduced the levels of MCL-1, cIAP1
and XIAP in both concentration- and time-dependent
manners but only marginally affected BCL-2 (Figure 5D).
Further analysis revealed that YCH337 induced prominent
apoptosis in both concentration- (Figure 5E and 5F) and
time- (Supplementary Figure S3A and 3B) dependent
manners. These data indicate that YCH337 induces
apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.
In inducing apoptosis, noticeably, YCH337 was
similar to VCR but different from VP-16 and especially
the combination of VP-16 with VCR. Either VCR or VP16 alone led to the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9 and
caspase-3, the cleavage of PARP and apoptosis, just as
YCH337 did (Figure 5C, 5E and 5F). However, only VCR
could also reduce the levels of MCL-1, cIAP1 and XIAP
in HeLa cells, but VP-16 could not (Figure 5D). Moreover,
VP-16 when combined with VCR could decrease
the latter’s activity including caspase-3 activation,
antiapoptotic protein reduction and apoptotic induction
(Figure 5C–5F).

YCH337 induces reversible M arrest but
irreversible DNA damage at a relatively low
concentration
Either tubulin or Top2 inhibitors can cause typical
cell cycle arrest [8, 20]. However, the effect of dual
tubulin/Top2 inhibitors on cell cycle progression is still
unknown. Our results showed that YCH337 caused a
typical G2/M arrest in HeLa cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 4A and 4B). The levels of MPM-2 and
Ser10-phosphorylated histone3 (p-H3), both of which are
mitotic molecular markers [21], progressively increased
in the YCH337- treated HeLa cells (Figure 4C). In
addition, CDK1/cyclin B1 complexes are considered
to be the switch to mitosis [22, 23]. YCH337 led to the
decrease in the p-T14/Y15-CDK1 level but the increase
in the cyclinB1 level (Figure 4D). The results indicate that
YCH337 arrests the cells in M rather than G2 phase.
To examine the reversibility of the M arrest and
DNA damage caused by YCH337, we treated HeLa
cells with the compound, then withdrew it and continued
to incubate the cells in drug-free medium. The 12-h
incubation in drug-free medium after drug withdrawal
appeared to almost completely reverse M arrest after
the cells were pretreated with 0.2 μM YCH337 for
12 h (Figure 4E–4G). In contrast, the levels of γH2AX
continued to increase (Figure 4G), indicating that DNA
damage was persistent at this condition. Moreover, the
prolonged drug-free incubation brought the cells into
G1 arrest at the 36-h time point and subsequently caused

the two liver cancer cell lines (BEL-7402 and SMMC7721) seemed to have relatively low sensitivity, the
profiling data appeared to show no apparent selectivity
of the proliferation inhibition among the tested tumor
cells. YCH337 is almost insoluble in water, which limits
the possibility of its administration into animals by
intravenous injection. We thus administrated YCH337
into animals by intraperitoneal injection to assess its in
vivo anticancer activity. The data showed that YCH337
significantly suppressed the growth of human colon cancer
HT-29 xenografts only with marginally reducing the body
weight of the tested nude mice (Figure 6B). No animal
death occurred in the experiment period. These data
indicate that YCH337 possesses potent in vitro and in vivo
anticancer activities with a broad anticancer spectrum.

achieving potent anticancer effects even in MDR cells or
Top2-mutated cells.
Our data indicate that YCH337 leads to microtubule
depolymerization by binding to the colchicine site
and Top2 inhibition. Thus YCH337 disrupts spindle
assembly and causes DSB damage. Consequently, mitotic
arrest and subsequent apoptosis occur, which finally
result in its proliferation inhibition in tumor cells and
growth suppression in tumor xenografts (Figure 6C).
Several characteristics of these activities are noticeable.
(1) YCH337 targets both microtubule and Top2,
but its microtubule depolymerization seems more
potent than its Top2 inhibition. This is reflected in its
microtubule depolymerization occurring earlier or at
lower concentrations than DNA damage and its M arrest.
(2) M arrest is reversible but DNA damage is persistent in
the YCH337-treated cells, although both are irreversible at
its relatively high concentrations (i.e., 0.5 μM or above).
This result suggests the reversible binding of YCH337 to
the colchicine site on one hand and its weaker but more
lasting Top2 inhibition on the other, in considering no
reported deficient repair for DSB in the tested HeLa cells.
(3) YCH337 induces apoptosis through both intrinsic
and extrinsic pathways. This might be potentiated by
its reducing antiapoptotic proteins including MCL-1,
cIAP1 and XIAP. However, the precise mechanisms still
remain to be clarified. (4) YCH337 elicits non-selective
proliferation inhibition in a panel of 19 tumor cell lines
originated from 10 different tissues, suggesting its possible
broad-spectrum antitumor activity. (5) YCH337 effectively
kills drug resistant tumor cells and respective parent cells
to an equivalent degree. Importantly, these drug resistant
tumor cells were established with either tubulin inhibitors
or Top2 inhibitors and overexpress drug transporters or
carry mutated Top2 [35, 36, 39]. This feature of YCH337
is likely to open the door for the dual tubulin/Top2
targeting strategy for cancer therapy due to extensive
clinical uses of tubulin inhibitors in combination with
Top2 inhibitors and frequent emergence of drug resistance
to them. Nevertheless, we have not yet known the effect
of YCH337 in cells containing the mutated colchicine site
because such cells are unavailable at present.
Although tubulin inhibitors and Top2 inhibitors
are widely used in combination in the clinic and some
combinations have been shown to mutually potentiate
the activities in leukemia and solid tumor cells [40], VP16 was reported to decrease the activation of caspase-3
and the induction of apoptotic cell death by colchicine (a
tubulin inhibitor though not used as an anticancer drug in
the clinic) in HEp-2 cells [11, 12]. In our study, similarly,
when combined with the clinically-used tubulin inhibitor
VCR, VP-16 was shown to antagonize the apoptosisinducing activity of VCR, as evidenced by causing less
caspase-3 activation, no antiapoptotic protein reduction
and lower apoptotic induction. These data indicate that not
all combinations of tubulin inhibitors with Top2 inhibitors

YCH337 kills both resistant and parental tumor
cells to an equivalent degree
Finally, we determined the effect of YCH337 on
drug-resistant cancer cells. KB/VCR and MES-SA/DX5
are MDR cancer cells lines established with the tubulin
inhibitor VCR and the Top2 inhibitor DX, respectively.
The two cell lines overexpress drug transporters such as
P-gp and are highly resistant to VCR, DX and other various
anticancer drugs [34, 35] (Table 1). However, YCH337
killed both of them, even a little more potently than it killed
their respective parent cells, suggesting that the MDR
mechanisms in these cells do not limit its in vitro activity.
On the other hand, the HL60/MX2 cell line,
established with the Top2 inhibitor MX, is resistant
basically to Top2 inhibitors, due to its Top2 mutation
rather than drug-transporter overexpression [36] (Table 1).
Our data showed that both HL60/MX2 and its parent
HL60 cell lines are highly sensitive to the dual tubulin/
Top2 inhibitor YCH337 when compared to the Top2
inhibitor MX (Table 1). The result indicates that even
when one drug target (i.e., Top2) is mutated, YCH337
still retains its possible cell killing through the other drug
target (i.e., tubulin).

DISCUSSION
Tubulin inhibitors and Top2 inhibitors are two
classes of the most important antitumor drugs in the clinic
[37, 38]. They are frequently used in combination due to
their different mechanisms of action but faced with the
issue of how to choose correct drug combinations and
take proper sequential approaches. Moreover, almost
all of them could lead to MDR and achieve only very
limited therapeutic efficacy in MDR tumors. In addition,
mutations in their respective targets could also confer
drug resistance to them. Here we show a new potential
anticancer strategy by dually targeting microtubule and
Top2, as exemplified with the novel compound YCH337,

MATERIALS AND METHODS

could achieve synergistic therapeutic effects, further
strengthening the importance of how to choose correct
drug combinations in the clinic. However, YCH337, as a
single agent dually targeting microtubule and Top2, shows
prominent apoptotic induction without the above issue of
VP-16 in combination with VCR or colchicine. From this
perspective, a strategy of dual targeting of microtubule
and Top2 to achieve anticancer effects might be feasible,
though needing more examples and data to support.
The α-carboline derivative YCH337 has a novel
chemical structure, bearing no structural analogy with
either tubulin inhibitors or Top2 inhibitors currently used
in the clinic [5, 9]. Neither have we found any reports on
α-carboline derivatives inhibiting microtubule or Top2.
Structurally, YCH337 contains two major moieties of
5-methoxyphenyl and α-carboline connected by a carbonyl
group. The 5-methoxyphenyl moiety of YCH337 is similar
to the methoxyphenyl moiety of the tubulin inhibitors MT7,
MT119 and MT189, which is critical for their binding to the
colchicine site and thus inhibiting tubulin polymerization
[21, 41, 42]. On the other hand, the α-carboline moiety
of YCH337 is similar to the β-carboline moiety of
β-carbolines derived from the marine alkaloid manzamine
A or arborescidine alkaloids, which is responsible for
their Top2 inhibition [9, 43, 44]. Therefore, the two
5-methoxyphenyl and α-carboline moieties of YCH337 are
likely associated with its microtubule depolymerization and
Top2 inhibition, respectively. However, detailed structureactivity relationships remain to be established, which are
critical for further demonstrating its mechanisms of action
and improving its anticancer activity and physicochemical
properties for drug development.
Together, our study presents a novel dual tubulin/
Top2 inhibitor YCH337 with potent anticancer activity
and drug-resistance-overcoming activity. It could act as
a prototype for the dual tubulin/Top2 targeting strategy
for cancer therapy. Such a strategy is likely to make the
conventional combinations of tubulin inhibitors and Top2
inhibitors easier and simpler and to reduce the occurrence
of drug resistance. Moreover, due to the novelty of its
chemical structure, YCH337 could serve as a promising
lead for future drug development.

Drugs, chemicals and reagents
YCH337 was prepared according to our previous
procedure [18] (Figure 1) with the purity over 98%
determined by high performance liquid chromatography.
Paclitaxel and CA4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Colchicine was obtained from Sangon
(Shanghai, China). VCR, DX and mitoxantrone (MX)
were obtained from Melonepharma (Dalian, China).
BODIPY FL-vinblastine was purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA); mitomycin C (MMC) was purchased from
Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). All the
reagents used in vitro were dissolved at 10 mM in 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a stock solution and the
aliquots were stored at −20°C. Prior to each experiment,
all the chemicals were diluted to desired concentrations

suspension cells were measured by the sulforhodamine B
(SRB; Sigma, MO) assay and luminescent cell viability
assay (Promega, Madison, WI) respectively, as reported
previously [42, 45]. Cells were seeded into 96-well
plates, cultured overnight and treated with gradient
concentrations of the tested agents for 72 h. Optic density
for both assays was read with an EnVision Multilabel
Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). The averaged IC50
values were determined with the Logit method from three
independent experiments.

Cells treated with YCH337 for the indicated time
were collected and washed with PBS, fixed with precooled 70% ethanol at 4°C. Staining went along in PBS
containing 40 μg/ml RNase A and 10 μg/ml propidium
iodide in the dark for 15 min. Cells (at least 1×104 cells
per sample) were collected with FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection
Cells treated with YCH337 for the indicated time

Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
detection

Cells were seeded on glass cover slips and cultured
for 24 h, and then treated with YCH337 for the indicated
time. Next, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100 at room
temperature for 5 min. After that, the cells were blocked
with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 4°C overnight,
incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h and stained
with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody at room
temperature for 30 min. Finally, the cells were counterstained with DAPI and imaged with an Olympus confocal
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Cells treated with YCH337 for the indicated time
were collected and washed with PBS. Then, the cells
were stained by using a JC-1 kit (Keygen, Nanjing,
China). MMP was analyzed with a FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Human colon cancer HT-29 xenografts in nude mice
were used to evaluate the anticancer activity of YCH337.
The model was established by the transplantation of 5×106
HT-29 cells subcutaneously on the right armpit of each 4–5
weeks old female BALB/cA nude mouse. When the average
tumor volume reached 100–200 mm3, 24 nude mice were
selected based on the tumor volume and randomly assigned
into vehicle, positive control and YCH337 groups. For
consecutive 14 days, the animals in the YCH337 group
were daily dosed intraperitoneally with YCH337 (25 mg/
kg/d). The animals in the positive control group were dosed
intravenously with MMC (5 mg/kg) on Day 0. The animals
in the vehicle group were daily injected intraperitoneally
with 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium. During the
treatment period, the implanted tumors were measured
with a caliper twice a week. The maximum width (X) and
length (Y) of the tumor were measured and the volume
(V) was calculated using the formula: V = (X2Y)/2. Then
relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated as follows:
RTV = Vt/V0. V0 was the tumor volume at the beginning
of the treatments, and Vt was the tumor volume after
treatments. The animal body weight was also measured
at the same time. The experiments abided by institutional
ethical guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee
(Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy
of Sciences, China).
