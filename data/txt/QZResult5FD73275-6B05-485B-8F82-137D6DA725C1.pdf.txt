ABSTRACT
Cisplatin has been widely employed as a cornerstone chemotherapy treatment
for a wide spectrum of solid neoplasms; increasing tumor responsiveness to cisplatin
has been a topic of interest for the past 30 years. Strong evidence has indicated that
mitochondrial fission participates in the regulation of apoptosis in many diseases;
however, whether mitochondrial fission regulates cisplatin sensitivity remains poorly
understood. Here, we show that MFF mediated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis
in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells after cisplatin treatment and that
miR-593-5p was downregulated in this process. miR-593-5p attenuated mitochondrial
fission and cisplatin sensitivity by targeting the 3’ untranslated region sequence
of MFF and inhibiting its translation. In exploring the underlying mechanism of
miR-593-5p downregulation, we observed that BRCA1 transactivated miR-593-5p
expression and attenuated cisplatin sensitivity in vitro. The BRCA1-miR-593-5pMFF axis also affected cisplatin sensitivity in vivo. Importantly, in a retrospective
analysis of multiple centers, we further found that the BRCA1-miR-593-5p-MFF axis
was significantly associated with cisplatin sensitivity and the survival of patients
with TSCC. Together, our data reveal a model for mitochondrial fission regulation at

BRCA1 in determining cisplatin sensitivity through the mitochondrial fission program.

INTRODUCTION

fission during apoptosis in mammalian cells is unclear
[17], mitochondrial fission appears to occur early in the
apoptotic pathway or prior to MOMP [18] and can even
be dissociated from MOMP [19]. Limited studies have
shown that cisplatin can induce apoptosis in Hela cells
[20] and ovarian cancer cells [21] through mitochondrial
fission; nevertheless, no studies have indicated whether
mitochondrial fission can predict cisplatin sensitivity in a
clinical setting. In addition, whether mitochondrial fission
participates in the cisplatin sensitivity of tongue squamous
cell carcinoma (TSCC) should also be investigated.
DRP1 is a prominent dynamin-related GTPase in
mammals that induces mitochondrial fission by generating
the mechanical force that constricts (mechanistically
pinches) mitochondria [22]. Multiple integral outermembrane proteins (including FIS1, MID49/51 and MFF)
work as DRP1 receptors to recruit DRP1 to mitochondria.
However, there are conflicting results regarding whether
inhibiting DRP1 enhances spontaneous apoptosis in
vitro and in vivo in several cancer types, including colon,
breast, lung and cervical cancers [23]. Additionally, in
a previous study, no significant difference was found in
cumulative survival between patients with high and low
DRP1 levels in lung adenocarcinomas [24]. Consequently,
the data suggest that DRP1 executes mitochondrial fission
and apoptosis in a manner that is co-regulated with its
pivotal receptor. However, the role of FIS1 and MID49/51
as outer-membrane proteins (tethers for DRP1) has
recently been challenged [25, 26]. FIS1 overexpression
affects neither mitochondria-associated DRP1 nor
mitochondrial fission [27], whereas MiD49 recruits DRP1
to the mitochondrial outer membranes and promotes
mitochondrial fusion rather than fission in vertebrates [28].
By contrast, other studies have clearly demonstrated that
MFF penetrates into the mitochondrial outer membrane
prior to DRP1 recruitment [29, 30], and DRP1 and MFF
co-localization structures induce mitochondrial fission
[31, 32]. However, no studies have indicated whether
MFF affects cisplatin sensitivity through mitochondrial
fission. In this study, we focused on MFF-dependent
mitochondrial fission and revealed a novel mechanism of
cisplatin sensitivity.
MiRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of
numerous cellular processes. Some miRNAs have been
found to regulate cisplatin sensitivity in cancer cells [33].
However, it is unknown whether miRNAs could regulate
cisplatin sensitivity through the mitochondrial fission
pathway. Interestingly, miRNAs have been reported to
regulate mitochondrial fission by targeting DRP1 and FIS1
in mouse cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the role of miRNA
in cancer cell mitochondrial fission requires further
investigation.
The present study revealed that MFF regulates

Cisplatin was first approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978 for the treatment
of testicular and bladder cancer and has been largely
employed as a cornerstone treatment in the fight against
a wide spectrum of solid neoplasms, including (but
not limited to) head and neck, colorectal, ovarian and
lung cancers [1]. Cisplatin exerts anticancer effects via
multiple mechanisms; however, its most prominent (and
best understood) mode of action involves the generation
of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA
damage response and the induction of mitochondrial
apoptosis [1]. Although cisplatin often leads to initial
therapeutic success, chemoresistance frequently develops
and leads to therapeutic failure. The initial patient
responsiveness to platinum-based therapies in oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is 80.6% [2]; however,
more than 70% of patients eventually relapse because
their tumors become resistant [3]. Intense research has
investigated this phenomenon over the past 30 years, and
several mechanisms have been described to be associated
with the cisplatin-resistant phenotype of tumor cells,
including decreased cellular drug accumulation, increased
levels of glutathione, increased levels of DNA repair
and increased anti-apoptotic activity [4]. Unfortunately,
no substantive progress has been made in overcoming
cisplatin resistance in a clinical setting due to the
numerous resistance mechanisms that cancer cells have.
Searching for other mechanisms through which cisplatin
can exert its apoptotic effects may be the most practical
avenue for achieving optimal effectiveness for this drug
in a clinical setting.
Mitochondria have an important role in the
initiation of apoptosis [5, 6]. In the intrinsic pathway, it
is generally accepted that mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP), which leads to the release
of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondrial
intermembrane space (IMS), is the most crucial event
driving initiator caspase activation and apoptosis.
However, recent evidence has revealed that certain cell
types survive MOMP [7, 8]. For example, MOMP could
be incomplete when some mitochondria fail to undergo
MOMP following an apoptotic stimulus. Therefore,
other mitochondrial activities may stimulate the intrinsic
pathway. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that
an abnormal mitochondrial dynamic participates in the
regulation of apoptosis [9]; this dynamic has been linked
to a variety of diseases, such as skeletal muscle disorders
[10, 11], Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A peripheral
neuropathy [12], neurodegeneration [13], acute kidney
injury [14] and myocardial infarction [15, 16]. Although

cells. miR-593-5p represses MFF expression by targeting
the MFF mRNA 3’-UTR. BRCA1 is generally thought to
regulate cisplatin sensitivity through DNA damage repair;
however, our in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that
BRCA1 transactivates miR-593-5p expression and inhibits
MFF expression through transcriptionally targeting miR593-5p, consequently regulating mitochondrial fission
and cisplatin sensitivity. Our results reveal a model
for the BRCA1-miR-593-5p–MFF axis in mediating
mitochondrial fission in cancer cells. More importantly,
the BRCA1-miR-593-5p–MFF axis is related to
cisplatin sensitivity and the survival of TSCC patients;
this discovery may provide novel regulatory factors for
enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in a clinical setting.

of mitochondria (Figure 1B) of cisplatin-treated cells.
Cisplatin induced an alteration in the expression of
FIS1, DRP1, MFN1, MFN2 and optic atrophy type I
(OPA1); this alteration was not affected by MFF siRNA
(Supplementary Figure S2C). Consequently, mitochondrial
fission (Figure 1C) and the apoptosis of TSCC cells
(Figure 1D-F) were attenuated by MFF siRNA. By
contrast, enforced MFF expression led to mitochondrial
fission and apoptosis (Figure 1G-K). These data suggest
that MFF regulates mitochondrial fission and cisplatin
sensitivity in TSCC cells.

RESULTS

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
MFF protein levels, but not mRNA levels, are upregulated,
we tested whether miRNAs control MFF expression. We
analyzed potential targets using a bioinformatics program
(http://regrna2.mbc.nctu.edu.tw). We found that the
3’untranslated region (3’UTRs) of MFF had binding sites
for miR-593-5p (Figure 2A). We first found that miR-5935p was downregulated after cisplatin exposure in Cal-27
cells (Figure 2B). The enforced expression of miR-593-5p
increased miR-593-5p levels (Supplementary Figure S3A)
and attenuated the increase in MFF protein levels after
cisplatin exposure (Figure 2C). By contrast, MFF mRNA
levels were not altered by miR-593-5p under cisplatin
conditions (Supplementary Figure S3B). DRP1 and FIS1
protein levels were also unchanged (Supplementary
Figure S3C). The knockdown of endogenous miR-593-5p
resulted in elevated MFF levels (Figure 2D). To determine
whether MFF is a direct target of miR-593-5p, we tested
the effect of miR-593-5p on MFF translation. The
introduction of mutations of MFF-3’UTRs that disrupt
base pairing between miR-593-5p and MFF rescued
luciferase expression (Figure 2E) and MFF protein
expression (Figure 2F). Together, these results suggest that
miR-593-5p directly targets MFF-3’UTRs.
Then, we tested whether MFF is a downstream target
of miR-593-5p during the regulation of mitochondrial
fission and cisplatin sensitivity. The enforced expression
of miR-593-5p inhibited mitochondrial fission (Figure
3A) and apoptosis (Figure 3B-D) after cisplatin exposure
in Cal-27 cells. However, this inhibitory effect was
significantly abolished when Cal-27 cells were transfected
with miR-593-5p mimics along with pcDNA3.1 plasmid
cloned with MFF expression cassette containing mutant
3’UTR (MFF-mut-3’UTR) at miR-593-5p response
element (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figure S3D). Target
protector technology [34], which disrupts the interaction
between miRNA-mRNA pairs, has been used to identify
the specific recognition sequence of a miRNA to a
target region. We employed an MFF target protector
(TP) and found that the inhibitory effect of miR-593-

miR-593-5p regulates mitochondrial fission and
cisplatin sensitivity through MFF

MFF regulates mitochondrial fission and cisplatin
sensitivity
Cisplatin can induce apoptosis by initiating a
mitochondrial fission pathway [20,21]. However, the
underlying mechanism of this effect remains elusive.
To study the mechanism through which mitochondrial
fission regulates cisplatin sensitivity in TSCC, we first
measured morphological changes in TSCC mitochondria
after cisplatin stimulation(Supplementary Figure S1). We
observed that mitochondrial fission increased in TSCC
cells (Supplementary Figure S1B) and that increased
levels of cytochrome c(CYTO c) were released from
the intermembrane space of the mitochondria to the
cytosol (Supplementary Figure S1C) after cisplatin
treatment. These results indicate that mitochondrial fission
participates in the apoptosis of TSCC cells after cisplatin
treatment.
Growing evidence has demonstrated that MFF
primarily penetrates the mitochondrial outer membrane
and recruits DRP1 to initiate mitochondrial fission
and cell apoptosis [29-32]; however, little is known
regarding the relationship between MFF and cisplatin
sensitivity. Therefore, we tested whether cisplatin affects
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in TSCC cells via
MFF-dependent machinery.
Cisplatin induced mitochondrial fission with
elevated MFF protein levels (Figure 1A), but not
elevated mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure S2A).
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that MFF
exhibited punctate localization in mitochondria and that
mitochondria fragmentation occurred upon cisplatin
treatment of TSCC cells (Supplementary Figure S2B).
MFF knockdown attenuated the MFF protein upregulation
(Supplementary Figure S2C) and partially inhibited the
release of cytochrome c in the intermembrane space

5p on mitochondrial fission and apoptosis was reduced
in the presence of the MFF target protector (Figure 3F,
Supplementary Figure S3E). Furthermore, we attempted
to determine whether the regulation of miR-593-5p on
MFF was cell type-specific and observed that miR-593-5p
levels were also decreased in Scc-9 cells after cisplatin
exposure (Supplementary Figure S4A). Exogenous miR593-5p expression concomitantly increased miR-5935p levels(Supplementary Figure S4B) and attenuated
MFF protein levels(Supplementary Figure S4C) without
affecting MFF mRNA levels(Supplementary Figure S4D).
Meanwhile, mitochondrial fission and cell apoptosis were
also attenuated by exogenous miR-593-5p expression in
Scc-9 cells(Supplementary Figure S4E and S4F). These
data suggest that miR-593-5p functionally controls
mitochondrial fission and cisplatin sensitivity through its
MFF downstream target in TSCC cells.

We investigated how miR-593-5p expression
could be downregulated under cisplatin stress. miRNA
expression has been reported to be regulated at the
transcriptional level under physiological and pathological
conditions [35,36]. We analyzed the 5-kb region upstream
of miR-593-5p and observed that it contains ten possible
binding sites (BS) for the transcription factor BRCA1
(jaspar.genereg.net; Supplementary Figure S5A). This
result led us to investigate whether BRCA1 is involved in
the regulation of miR-593-5p expression.
First, we observed that BRCA1 was downregulated
under cisplatin stress in Cal-27 cells (Figure 4A).

enforced expression of BRCA1 (Supplementary
Figure S5C) downregulated or upregulated miR-5935p expression, respectively, and expressing exogenous
BRCA1 attenuated the cisplatin-induced downregulation
of miR-593-5p (Figure 4B). Furthermore, a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) quantitative PCR (qPCR)
assay revealed that BRCA1 bound to binding site 3 (BS3)
but not to the other binding sites under physiological
conditions (Figure 4C). Cisplatin treatment led to a
reduced association of BRCA1 with the miR-593-5p
promoter in the BS3 region (Figure 4D); the luciferase
reporter assay also demonstrated reduced miR-593-5p
promoter activity after cisplatin exposure (Figure 4E).
BRCA1 overexpression increased miR-593-5p promoter
activity; this enhancement was reversed through mutations
introduced into the BS3 region (Figure 4F). miR-593-5p
is located within the intron of the SND1 gene, but SND1
mRNA levels were not substantially altered after cisplatin
treatment (Supplementary Figure S5D) or BRCA1
overexpression (Supplementary Figure S5E). Together,
these data suggest that BRCA1 can positively regulate
miR-593-5p expression in Cal-27 cells.
The role of BRCA1 in miR-593-5p expression led
us to question whether the BRCA1–miR-593-5p–MFF
axis is functionally related to mitochondrial fission and
cisplatin sensitivity in TSCC cells. Cisplatin-induced
mitochondrial fission and apoptosis were attenuated by
BRCA1 (Figure 5A-D) in a manner that was dependent
on the level of MFF protein (Supplementary Figure
S5F) in Cal-27 cells. The knockdown of miR-593-5p
attenuated the BRCA1 inhibitory effect on the level of
MFF protein, mitochondrial fission and apoptosis induced
by cisplatin(Figure 5E and 5F, Supplementary Figure
S5G). We also found that BRCA1 was downregulated
after cisplatin treatment and that exogenous BRCA1
attenuated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis as well as
the miR-593-5p level and MFF protein level in Scc-9 cells
(Supplementary Figure S6A-D). Taken together, BRCA1,
miR-593-5p and MFF constitute an axis that regulates
mitochondrial fission and cisplatin sensitivity in TSCC
cells.
Meanwhile, we tested whether BRCA1–miR-5935p–MFF axis-dependent regulation was sensitivity to
other DNA-damaging agents. We found that MFF protein
expression was upregulated but the expression of miR593-5p and BRCA1 protein was downregulated when Cal27 and Scc-9 cells were treated with adriamycin (ADR)
or camptothecin(CPT) (Supplementary Figure S7A). In
addition, we found that overexpression of BRCA1 could
attenuate the mitochondrial fission and apoptosis induced
by ADR or CPT(Supplementary Figure S7B and S7C).
These data suggest that chemosensitivity to other DNAdamaging agents could also be regulated by the BRCA1–
miR-593-5p–MFF axis in TSCC cells.

We established three groups of TSCC xenografts to
investigate whether the BRCA1–miR-593-5p–MFF axis
could influence the apoptosis and cisplatin sensitivity of
TSCC cells in vivo.
First, we found that MFF knockdown attenuated the
inhibition of the tumor burden induced by cisplatin (Figure
6A and 6B, Supplementary Figure S8A). Furthermore,
MFF expression and apoptosis were attenuated by the
stable expression of MFF shRNA in Cal-27 cells under
cisplatin treatment (Figure 6C, Supplementary Figure
S8A-C). These data suggest that MFF mediates the
signal for apoptosis and cisplatin sensitivity in vivo.
Cal-27 cells with stable miR-593-5p expression showed
enhanced tumor growth in the presence of cisplatin
(Figure 6D and 6E, Supplementary Figure S8D). We also
found that miR-593-5p was upregulated but MFF and
apoptosis were attenuated given the stable expression
of miR-593-5p in xenografts after cisplatin treatment
(Figure 6F, Supplementary Figure S8D-F). These results
suggest that miR-593-5p inhibits apoptosis and cisplatin
sensitivity in vivo by directly targeting MFF. Finally, in
Cal-27 cells with stable BRCA1 expression, we observed
that the inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 6G and 6H,
Supplementary Figure S8G) was attenuated by BRCA1 in
response to cisplatin treatment while BRCA1 expression
and miR-593-5p levels were increased(Supplementary
Figure S8H and 8I). MFF levels and apoptosis were
attenuated by stable BRCA1 expression under cisplatin
treatment (Figure 6I, Supplementary Figure S8G-I). These
data suggest that BRCA1 could regulate apoptosis and
cisplatin sensitivity in vivo through its downstream targets
miR-593-5p and MFF. Taken together, the BRCA1-miR593-5p–MFF axis regulates cisplatin sensitivity through
the mitochondrial fission pathway in vivo.

High MFF expression and low miR-593-5p or
BRCA1 expression are associated with cisplatin
sensitivity and good patient prognosis
We evaluated the clinical significance of the
BRCA1–miR-593-5p–MFF axis in cisplatin sensitivity
as well as patient prognosis for TSCC. We performed a
retrospective analysis of TSCC samples from 132 patients
from three independent centers. According to previous
studies [37], patients with a partial or complete response
were defined as having cisplatin-sensitive tumors,
whereas TSCC patients(TSCCs) with progressive disease
or stable disease were defined as having non-sensitive
or resistant tumors. Immunohistochemical staining and
in situ hybridization demonstrated that MFF expression
was higher and miR-593-5p and BRCA1 expression was
lower in cisplatin-sensitive TSCC cells compared with
non-sensitive cells (Figure 7A). Consequently, cisplatin14891

sensitive TSCC cells presented a higher percentage of
apoptotic cells than non-sensitive cells (Figure 7A).
There was a significant difference in the expression
profiles of chemosensitive and non-sensitive TSCCs, as
determined by the percentage of positive cells (Figure
7A). Additionally, a Spearman order correlation analysis
showed that MFF expression in TSCC was inversely
correlated with miR-593-5p (rs=-0.653, P<0.001) and
BRCA1 levels (rs=-0.532, P < 0.001); however, miR-5935p expression correlated with BRCA1 levels (rs=0.535,
P<0.001; Figure 7B).
Next, we analyzed the association of MFF, miR-5935p and BRCA1 expression with the clinicopathological
status of TSCC patients (Table 1). No significant
correlation was observed between MFF, miR-593-5p or

BRCA1 expression and sex, age, lymph node status or
clinical stage. However, MFF, miR-593-5p and BRCA1
expression were significantly associated with cisplatin
sensitivity. Tumors with cisplatin sensitivity expressed
higher levels of MFF and lower levels of miR-593-5p and
BRCA1. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation between
MFF, miR-593-5p and BRCA1 expression and patient
overall survival (OS). A univariate Cox regression analysis
indicated that the patients with TSCC and a high MFF
expression level or low miR-593-5p or BRCA1 levels

mitochondrial fission and consequent cisplatin sensitivity.
miR-593-5p, which is downregulated in response to
cisplatin exposure, can inhibit MFF expression as well
as mitochondrial fission by targeting MFF. We explored
the mechanism by which miR-593-5p expression is
regulated and found BRCA1 can transactivate miR-593-5p
expression and inhibit MFF expression and the consequent
mitochondrial fission through transcriptionally targeting
miR-593-5p. Our results reveal a novel regulatory model
of mitochondrial fission that affects cisplatin sensitivity
via miRNA and BRCA1 in cancer cells.
In vertebrates, the target specificity of miRNAs
is regulated by the requirement of small sequence
complementarity between bases 2 and 8 of the miRNA and
a corresponding seven-nucleotide sequence in the 3’UTR
of the target mRNA [38]. The ability of a single miRNA
to affect the expression of a wide variety of proteins has
led to increased interest in miRNAs as mediators of the
cellular response to cisplatin stimulation, and numerous
miRNAs have been identified [33, 39]. However, no
miRNAs have been identified as regulating mitochondrial
fission and consequent cisplatin sensitivity. We found
that MFF is a direct target of miR-593-5p and that miR593-5p inhibits cisplatin sensitivity in TSCC through its
suppression of MFF expression.
It has been demonstrated that approximately 50%
of miRNAs are predicted to be expressed from the introns
of protein-coding transcripts [40]. Accordingly, intronic
miRNAs may be transcribed as part of their host genes
or transcribed independently using their own promoters.
Ongoing studies have revealed that one-third of intronic
miRNAs have transcription initiation regions that are
separate from the promoters of their host genes [41].
Strikingly, miR-593-5p is an intronic miRNA in the SND1
gene; we identified the binding site of BRCA1 to be within
the SND1 gene, and BRCA1 consistently influenced
the expression of miR-593-5p, but not of SND1, in our
findings.
The chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin primarily
acts against cancer by damaging DNA and is used in
the treatment of many solid tumors. BRCA1 is a tumor
suppressor gene located on chromosome 17q21 that has
been intensively investigated as participating in the repair
of cisplatin-induced DNA double-strand breaks [42].
Accordingly, a decrease in BRCA1 expression leads to a
decreased proficiency in DNA repair, increased cisplatin
sensitivity and improved survival in non-small cell lung
cancer [43, 44], breast cancer [45], advanced esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma [46] and ovarian cancer [47]
patients. However, it is currently unknown whether
BRCA1 expression correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in
TSCC. In this study, we found that cisplatin decreased the
level of BRCA1 in TSCC patients and that reduction of
BRCA1 was positively correlated with overall survival.
Notably, the mechanism of BRCA1 downregulation
by cisplatin remains poorly understood, a few previous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies demonstrated that BRCA1 can be downregulated
at translation [48,49] or transcription levels [50, 51] by
cisplatin. Recent studies found BRCA1 was a direct
targets of miR-638 [48] and miR-9 [49] and BRCA1
protein decreased upon cisplatin treatment. However, the
mechanism of BRCA1 mRNA downregulation has not
been clear, there may be a TP53-sensitive component [50]
or EZH2-dependent [51] which need to be verified in the
further studies.
In addition to its role in DNA repair, BRCA1
also has multiple roles in cellular functions, such as
transcriptional regulation. The transcriptional activity of
the C-terminal region of BRCA1 was first identified when
it was fused with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain [52].
Recent studies have firmly established the role of BRCA1
as a transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor
[53]. A recent study identified the direct transcriptional
targets of BRCA1 by combining gene expression data
with BRCA1 binding sites detected using ChIP-chip
analysis. However, the results suggested that only 44
out of the 1,294 transcriptional targets may be directly
regulated by BRCA1 [54]. Whether BRCA1 binds to DNA
directly or indirectly has been extensively debated, but it
is accepted that BRCA1 interacts with DNA not only to
repair damaged DNA but also to regulate transcription.
Our results suggest that BRCA1 has a novel role in the
regulation of mitochondrial fission and cisplatin sensitivity
through transactivating miR-593-5p expression in TSCC
cells.
The present study reveals a link between the
BRCA1-miR-593-5p-MFF axis and the mitochondrial
fission program of TSCC (Figure 7D). Future studies are
needed to elucidate how this pathway is integrated into
the DNA repair pathway and its relationship with other
intrinsic apoptotic factors. Notably, clinical evidence
suggests that BRCA1, miR-593-5p and MFF levels predict
cisplatin sensitivity, and the modulation of this axis may
provide a therapeutic approach for upregulating cisplatin
sensitivity.

ChIP assays

for 48 h. The viral supernatants were collected, filtered,
mixed with fresh complete medium (1:1) and 4 µg/mL
of polybrene (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA), and then
added to Cal-27 or Scc-9 TSCC cells. The stably infected
cells were selected with 2µg/mL of Puromycin (Sigma, St
Louis, Missouri, USA) for two weeks.
Lentiviral plasmid (pLVX-mCMV-tdTomato-PGKPuro) delivering miR-593 precursors were bought from
BioWit Technologies (Shenzhen, China). The viruses were
amplified in HEK293 cells. Lentiviral infection of the Cal27 cell line was performed as previously described [57].

ChIP assays were performed as previously described
with some modifications [15,54]. The antibodies used for
immunoprecipitation were rabbit IgG (sc-805, Santa Cruz)
and BRCA1 (ab16780; Abcam). In brief, Cal-27 cells
(5×106) were washed with PBS and incubated for 10 min
with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. The crosslinking was halted with 0.1 M glycine for 5 min. The cells
were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 1 h at 4°C in a
lysis buffer and then sonicated into chromatin fragments
with an average length of 500-800 bp as assessed via
agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples were precleared
with Protein-A agarose (Roche) for 1 h at 4°C on a rocking
platform, and 5 µg of specific antibodies were added and
rocked overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated DNA was
purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The final ChIP
DNA was then used as a template in qPCR reactions using
primers that encompass ten possible BRCA1 binding
sites of the homo miR-593-5p promoter. The primers are
presented in Supplementary Table S1. The specificity
of the PCR amplification was confirmed via agarose gel
electrophoresis.

Luciferase reporter assay
We cloned MFF expression cassette containing miR593-5p targeting site (wide type or mutated) into the pGL3Control plasmid downstream of the luciferase reporter
gene. In addition, we cloned miR-593-5p promoter region
containing the BRCA1 binding site sequence (wild type
or mutated) into the pGL3-Basic plasmid upstream of
the luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase activities were
measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA), and the target effect was expressed as the
relative luciferase activity of the reporter vector with the
target sequence over that without the target sequence.

Transfections

Target protector preparation and transfection

MFF siRNAs (E-018261) and BRCA1 siRNAs (E003461) were obtained from GE Dharmacon. miR-5935p mimics and inhibitors were obtained from Ribobio
(Guangzhou, China). Cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

The target protector (TP) was designed
and named as others described [15,34]. In brief,
the MFF-TP miR-593-5p sequence was 5’CGACATAAGTGCAGACTCGTCAAGA-3’.
The
MFF-TP
control
was
5’CGAGATAACTCCACACTCCTCAAGA -3’. The
sequences were obtained from Gene Tools. Transfection
of the target protector was performed using an EndoPorter kit (Gene Tools) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Plasmid construction and establishment of stable
cell lines
An MFF shRNA retrovirus vector (pSR-puroMFF1 shRNA, 37247) [55] and a BRCA1 (pBABEpuro HA BRCA1, 14999) [56] retrovirus vector were
obtained from Addgene (MA, USA). BRCA1 was also
cloned into pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA-BRCA1. The
primers to amplify BRCA1 were as follows: forward:

Isolation of mitochondria and cytosol
Subcellular fractions were prepared as described
previously [16]. In brief, the cells were washed twice with
cold PBS, and the pellet was suspended in 0.2 ml of buffer
(20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),
0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 250
mM sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail.
Then, the cells were homogenized with 12 strokes in a
Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation twice
at 750 g for 5 min at 4 °C to collect nuclei and debris.
The mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane pellet was
collected with further centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min
at 4 °C; the supernatants were collected as the cytosolic

confocal TCS SP5 microscope (Lecia, Solms, Germany).
The assessment and quantification of mitochondrial
morphology were performed as described previously[59].
Briefly, the extent of mitochondrial fission was analyzed
on a cell-to-cell basis. Mitochondria fission was calculated
as the percentage of cells with fragmented mitochondria
relative to the total number of cells, which were randomly
selected and scored. A punctiform mitochondrial
phenotype was scored as a fragmented mitochondrion
when at least 90% of its tubular mitochondria were
disintegrated. At least 200 randomly selected cells in
multiple fields were assessed.

Apoptosis assay
Cal-27 and Scc-9 cells were treated with the IC50
of cisplatin(Sigma, USA) for 24 hours for an apoptosis
assay [37,58]. Additionally, Cal-27 and Scc-9 cells were
treated with 2×10-6 M adriamycin(ADR) (Sigma, USA)
or 15×10-6 M camptothecin(CPT) (Sigma, USA) for 24
hours for an apoptosis assay. TUNEL technology was
performed using a kit from Roche (Cat.No.11684795910).
The detection procedures were in accordance with the kit
instructions. Sections were examined with an ImagerZ1
microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). An investigator blind
to the treatment quantified 20 random fields of samples.
Caspase-3/7 activity was determined using an Apo-ONE®
Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 assay kit from Promega
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometry
was performed using Annexin V and propidium iodide
double staining (Sigma-Aldrich).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). The quantitative detection of MFF, SND1 and
β-actin was performed via qRT-PCR using SYBR Green
Real-time PCR Master Mix (ReverTra Ace, Toyobo) and
a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of MFF
primers were 5’ -CACCACCTCGTGTACTTACGC-3’
(forward) and 5’ -CCGCTCTCTTTTTAGTCTGCC-3’
(reverse). The sequences of the SND1 primers were
5’-CAAATCAGGAAGAAACATCAAAGAC-3’
(forward)
and
5’-AATCACATAATCAACAGTTGGACAG-3’
(reverse). The sequences of the β-actin primers were
5’-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGATCC-3’ (forward) and
5’-ACATGCCGGAGCCGTTGTCG-3’ (reverse). The
primers for miR-593-5p and U6 detection assays were
purchased from Ribobio.

MTT assay
To monitor the IC50 of cisplatin, Cal-27 and Scc-9
cells were treated with cisplatin atdifferent concentrations
for 24 hours. An MTT assay was performed as described
previously [37]. The data were analyzed with the software
origin 7.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) to fit a
sigmoidal curve. The IC50 is considered to be the cisplatin
concentration that reduces cell proliferation by 50%. The
IC50 values of cisplatin for Cal-27 and Scc-9 cells were
8×10-6 and 1.8×10-5 M, respectively.

Western blotting

Immunofluorescence staining

Immunoblotting was performed as previously
described[37]. Briefly, cells were lysed for 0.5 h at 4°C
in a RIPA Buffer (R0278, Sigma) containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail. Protein extracts were resolved through
8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad,
Berkeley, CA, USA), probed with antibody against human
MFF (ab81127), DRP1 (ab56788), FIS1 (ab71498),
TOM20(ab78547), BRCA1 (ab16780; Abcam), MFN1
(sc-50330), MFN2 (sc-50331), OPA1 (sc-393296),
COXIV(sc-376731), cytochrome c (sc-13560) (Santa
Cruz), β-actin (Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA) or Tubulin
(sc-53646) and then with a peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (Proteintech); they were visualized
via chemiluminescence (GE, Fairfield, CT, USA).

Cells on coverslips were stained for MFF and
cytochrome c(CYTO c). After mitochondrial staining, the
cells were incubated with primary antibodies against MFF
(ab81127, Abcam) or cytochrome c (sc-13560, Santa Cruz)
and then incubated with rhodamine- or FITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The coverslips were
counterstained with 46-diamidino-2-phenyl indole and
imaged under a confocal microscope TCS SP5 (Lecia,

In situ hybridization

Tumor xenografts

In situ hybridization was performed as previously
described[37] according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, after demasking,
miR-593-5p was hybridized to 5’ DIG-labeled
LNAprobes. Then, the digoxigenins were recognized via
a specific anti-DIG antibody that is directly conjugated
to alkaline phosphatase. The nuclei were counterstained
with Kernechtrot Solution (N3020, Sigma). In all, 5×200
tumor cells were counted randomly in each section. The
sections with more than 300 miR-593-5p-positive cells
were considered to have high miR-593-5p expression.

A TSCC xenograft mouse model was used to
evaluate in vivo cisplatin sensitivity. Male BALB/cnu mice 4 to 6 weeks old were prepared for tumor
implantation. All animals were maintained in a sterile
environment on a daily 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Cal27 cells with stable expression of MFF, miR-593-5p and
BRCA1 were used. After resuspension in 150 μL of PBS,
Cal-27 cells (5×106/mouse) were injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of the nude mice. One week after
implantation, when the tumor became palpable at a size of
~2 mm in diameter, cisplatin (5 mg/kg) was administered
via intraperitoneal injections every three days from days
8 to 32. Tumor volume was calculated at the day of
cisplatin injection according to the following formula:
TV (mm3)=length × width2×0.5. At day 35, the primary
tumors were carefully removed, imaged, and analyzed
via immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, western
blotting and qRT-PCR.

Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry [37], TSCC sections
were incubated with MFF (ab81127) and BRCA1
(ab16780, Abcam) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The
sections were then treated with a secondary antibody,
followed by further incubation with streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase complex. Diaminobenzidine
(Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) was used as a chromogen,
and the nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. A
total of 5×200 tumor cells were counted in each section.
Sections with more than 350 MFF- or BRCA1-positive
cells were considered to have high MFF or BRCA1
expression.

Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
19.0. Student’s t-test and the Chi-square test were used to
analyze the relationship between MFF, miR-593-5p and
BRCA1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics.
To measure the association between pairs of variables,
Spearman order correlations were performed. KaplanMeier survival curves were plotted, and a log-rank test
was performed. All experiments for cell cultures were
performed in at least three independent experiments.
The data are expressed as the means ± SEM. P<0.05 was
considered significant.

Patient and tissue samples
Specimens of locally advanced TSCCs (n=132)
were obtained from three independent centers, including
the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hospital (n=53), the Affiliated Hospital
of North Sichuan Medical College (n=45) and the West
China Hospital (n=34) between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31,
2008. The patients were treated with cisplatin prior to
surgery. According to the ‘Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors’ of the World Health Organization,
TSCCs with progressive disease or stable disease response
was designated to be cisplatin-resistant or non-sensitive
TSCC, whereas TSCCs that showed a partial or complete
response was determined to be cisplatin-sensitive TSCC.
The tissues were obtained from the respective pathology
departments, and histological diagnosis and scoring
of all the cases were performed by two independent
pathologists. Survival time was calculated from the date
of surgery to the date of death or to the last follow-up. The
date of death was obtained from patient records or through
follow-up telephone calls. This study was approved by the
institutional ethical review boards of three hospitals, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
