NF-κB–Inhibited Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells Are Rescued
from Apoptosis by Heme Oxygenase-1 Induction
Stuart A. Rushworth1, Kristian M. Bowles2, Prahlad Raninga1, and David J. MacEwan1

Abstract
Despite high basal NF-κB activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, inhibiting NF-κB in these cells has
little or no effect on inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) underlies this
resistance of AML to tumor necrosis factor–induced apoptosis. Here, we describe a mechanism by which HO-1
is a silent antiapoptotic factor only revealed when NF-κB is inhibited, thus providing a secondary antiapoptotic mechanism to ensure AML cell survival and chemoresistance. We show that inhibition of NF-κB increased HO-1 expression in primary AML cells compared with that of nonmalignant cells. In addition, we
observed this suppressed HO-1 level in AML cells compared with CD34+ nonmalignant control cells. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and small interfering RNA knockdown, we showed that the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 control this suppression of HO-1 in AML cells. Finally, we showed that inhibition of HO-1
and NF-κB in combination significantly induced apoptosis in AML cells but not in noncancerous control cells.
Thus, NF-κB inhibition combined with HO-1 inhibition potentially provides a novel therapeutic approach to
treat chemotherapy-resistant forms of AML. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2973–83. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal
disorder of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), characterized by
proliferation and differentiation of abnormal cells, causing
accumulation of immature myeloid cells in bone marrow
and blood. Despite considerable advances in diagnosis of
AML, initial chemotherapies cure <20% of sufferers (1). Relapse rates following treatment are high, and current treatments offer little chance of long-term survival for most
patients, as they develop drug-resistant forms of AML.
NF-κB is a family of transcription factors that share homology to the retroviral oncoprotein v-Rel. The five members
of the mammalian NF-κB family consist of the class I proteins NF-κB1 (p105→p50) and NF-κB2 (p100→p52) and class
II proteins RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel. Inhibitors of NF-κB
have emerged as potential therapies against AML (2). This
is because AML blasts have constitutive NF-κB activation
(3). Such abnormal levels of constitutively activated NF-κB

have been detected in other hematopoietic cancers, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (4) and acute lymphoid leukemia
(5), and in various solid tumors (6). Previously, we have highlighted the limited effect of NF-κB inhibition on apoptosis of
AML (7). We showed in AML-derived cell lines that NF-κB inhibition alone or combined with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
activation (a classic apoptotic stimulus for normal inflammatory cells) had no effect on cell death. In addition, the cytoprotective gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was induced in AML
cell lines in response to NF-κB inhibition and superinduced
when in combination with TNF activation. Furthermore, when
HO-1 superinduction was inhibited using small interfering
RNA (siRNA)–targeted knockdown, the AML cell lines became
susceptible to TNF-induced apoptosis, proving a crucial role
for HO-1 in apoptotic-resistant forms of AML cells.
HO-1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of heme catabolism. It
catalyzes the breakdown of heme into equimolar amounts
of carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin, with biliverdin
rapidly metabolized to bilirubin (8). HO-1 is critical in two
important physiologic processes: recycling iron molecules
for erythropoiesis and maintaining homeostasis under stressful conditions (9). The latter property, a manifestation of the
potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and signaling activities of CO and bilirubin, is important in a wide range of human pathologies, including inflammatory and cardiovascular
diseases (10–12). In cancer, growing evidence indicates that
HO-1 may play a role in carcinogenesis (13). That is, HO-1 is
often upregulated in tumors, and its expression is further
increased in response to therapies (14, 15). Although the
exact effect can be tissue specific, HO-1 can be regarded as
an enzyme that facilitates tumor progression.
In addition to its substrate heme, a variety of conditions and
agents, both physiologic and nonphysiologic, including UV

irradiation, hyperthermia, inflammatory cytokines, bacterial
endotoxins, and heavy metals, potently stimulate HO-1
(16–20). This is due to the 5′-flanking region of the HO-1 gene
containing binding sites for several different transcription factors that regulate inflammation and apoptosis, including NFκB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and NF-E2–related factor 2
(Nrf2; refs. 21–23). The function of NF-κB in regulating HO-1
expression in human cells is controversial because more than
one study suggests a direct relationship between NF-κB and
HO-1 activity (24, 25); however, other studies investigating
the HO-1 promoter show that the κB response element is
unresponsive to several HO-1 inducers (26). The present study
was undertaken to further define the role of NF-κB and Nrf2 in
regulating HO-1 gene expression in AML.

Materials and Methods
Materials. AML-derived cell line THP-1 was obtained
from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures.
Anti-human HO-1 antibody was purchased from Assay Designs. Anti–NF-κB antibodies p50, p52, p65, and c-Rel were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. All other antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. BAY
11-7082 was procured from Calbiochem. Control, HO-1,
p50, and p65 siRNAs were from Applied Biosystems. Zinc
protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX; HO-1 inhibitor) and copper
protoporphyrin IX (CuPP IX; control) were obtained from
Frontier Scientific. All other reagents were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, unless indicated.
Cell culture. Primary AML cells were obtained under local
ethical approval (LREC ref 07/H0310/146). For primary cell
isolation, heparinized blood was collected from volunteers
and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated by Histopaque density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs
(4 × 106/mL) were incubated in complete medium for 2 h at
37°C to allow monocyte adherence. Selection of human HSCs
was isolated from PBMCs using a CD34-positive selection kit
(Miltenyi Biotec). For all CD34+ and primary monocyte experiments, at least three different donors were used. AML
samples of <80% blasts were purified using CD34+ selection.
Cell type was confirmed by microscopy and flow cytometry.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 105 cells using the Nucleic Acid PrepStation
(Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription was performed
using the RNA PCR Core kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time
PCR primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) and HO-1 were purchased from Invitrogen. Primer
sequences were as follows: GAPDH, 5′-ACCAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGC-3′ (reverse); HO-1, 5′-ATGGCCTCCCTGTACCACATC-3′
(forward) and 5′-TGTTGCGCTCAATCTCCTCCT-3′ (reverse).
Relative quantitative real-time PCR used SYBR Green technology (Roche) on generated cDNAs. After preamplification
(95°C, 2 min), PCRs were amplified for 45 cycles (95°C 15 s,
60°C 10 s, 72°C 10 s) on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). Each mRNA
expression was normalized against GAPDH mRNA expression
using the standard curve method.

Promoter assays. To generate HO-1 promoter construct
pHO1Luc, a DNA fragment containing 5.07 kb of the human
HO-1 promoter region was amplified from genomic DNA using
PCR and specific primers (reverse, 5′-CTGCCTCCTCTCGAG‐
CGT-3′; forward, 5′-CCCTGCAGAATCGAGCAC-3′). The fragment was blunt-end cloned into the SmaI site in PGL3 plasmid
(Promega). Mutated antioxidant response element (ARE), κB1,
and κB2 constructs were generated with the following PCR primers: mutARE, 5′-CTAGATTTTGCTGAGTCACCAGTGCC-3′;
mutκB1, 5′-GAGACGCTCTCTGGAATTTCCTTATCTGCC-3′;
and mutκB2, 5′-GGCCAGACTTTGTTTCCCAAGGGTCATATGA-3′, introduced using QuikChange XL Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. THP-1 cells
were untreated or treated with BAY 11-7082 for 8 h and then
fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature.
Optimized sonication conditions generated DNA fragments
between 300 and 600 bp. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated
with IgG, anti-Nrf2, anti-p65, or anti-p50 antisera. Association
of Nrf2, p50, or p65 was measured by PCR on immunoprecipitated chromatin using the following primers spanning the
ARE site located at −4100 (forward, 5′-TTTGCTGAGTCACCAGTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TAAA‐GCTGCCCTTTCACCTC-3′),
the NF-κB1 site at −2200 (forward, 5′-TTTGTGTGTGTGTG‐
TGTGTGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAGCTGATGCCCACTTTCT-3′),
and the NF-κB2 site at −180 (forward, 5′-GACGCTCTCTGGAATTTCCTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGGGTGACAAGAGCGAGAC-3′). Triplicate real-time PCR was performed on
immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA.
Western immunoblotting, binding assay, and flow cytometry. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed
as described previously (27) using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay–extracted whole-cell lysates. Nuclear extracts were
prepared as previously described (28). NF-κB DNA binding
was measured using the NF-κB p65 transcription factor
ELISA kit (Panomics). Flow cytometry for measuring apoptosis was performed on a Beckman Coulter Epics XL. A dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay was used to determine cellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (29, 30).
Transfections. Cells (106 per well) were transfected using
Amaxa Nucleofector using equivalent molar concentrations
of siRNAs (to yield final concentrations of 30 nmol/L).
PGL3 reporter and pRL-CMV control constructs (0.5 μg)
were cotransfected into THP-1. Transfected cells were incubated 24 h before indicated treatments. Reporter assays
were measured with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega).
Proliferation/death assays. Cells were treated with different doses of CuPP IX, ZnPP IX, and BAY 11-7082 (10 μmol/L)
for up to 72 h. Cell number was measured with MTS One
Solution Assay (Promega) before reading 490-nm absorbance
in quadruplicate.
Statistical analyses. Student's t test was performed to assess statistical significance among groups. Results with
P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results
represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. For Western blotting experiments, data are representative of three independent experiments.

Results
High basal expression of NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 in
AML. To understand the function of NF-κB in AML cells,
we examined the nuclear profile of NF-κB subunits in human AML cells compared with nonmalignant control cells.
To do this, we obtained nuclear extracts from primary
monocytes, primary AML blasts, and an AML-derived cell
line (THP-1). Protein expression was examined using Western blot for the NF-κB family members p50, p52, p65, and

AML monocytic cell line have increased levels of nuclear
p50 and p65 but not c-Rel and p52 when compared with
nonmalignant control cells. To determine the κB-binding
potential of the increased p50 and p65 levels in AML cells,
we used the Transfactor ELISA from Panomics. This
showed increased binding of both p50 and p65 in nuclear
extracts of all AML samples tested when compared with
noncancerous control cells (Fig. 1A). We also showed by
immunohistochemistry that basal p65 nuclear translocation

was higher in AML samples but not in control cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
AML cells are not killed by NF-κB inhibition. To understand the mechanism by which AML protects against apoptosis in response to NF-κB inhibition, we fully analyzed
the response of 17 AML patient samples (Table 1), AML cell
lines, and nonmalignant control cells to NF-κB inhibition by
using BAY 11-7082 (an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation,
IC50 of 10 μmol/L). We observed in these cells a small and
insignificant amount of cell death in response to NF-κB inhibition by BAY 11-7082 up to 10 μmol/L (Fig. 1B). At the highest concentration of BAY 11-7082 (20 μmol/L), we see some
cell death in AML blasts and control nonmalignant cells,
suggesting some nonspecific toxic effect at higher doses.
To determine if NF-κB activity was inhibited by BAY 117082, we examined nuclear extracts from THP-1 cells treated
with BAY 11-7082 for various time points. Figure 1C shows
that both p50 and p65 were inhibited from 4 to 16 hours after
treatment. Previously, we have shown that AML-derived cell
lines but not noncancerous control cells are resistant to TNFinduced cell death signals (7). The model used for studying
TNF-induced cell death was NF-κB inhibition in conjunction
with TNF activation (a well-established means for testing NFκB–driven antiapoptotic mechanisms). Here, we determined
if primary AML cells are resistant to such signals. Figure 1D
shows that AML cells are resistant to TNF-induced apoptotic

signals, unlike primary monocytes that display normal TNFinduced death.
Inhibiting NF-κB in AML cells induces HO-1 expression.
Our research has shown that NF-κB activity in conjunction
with TNF can cause AML cells to superinduce the cytoprotective gene HO-1 (7). Here, we wanted to know if inhibiting
NF-κB alone could induce HO-1 expression in AML cells. We
tested AML blasts, AML cell lines, and nonmalignant control
cells (CD34+ HSCs and human monocytes). Compared with
nonmalignant control cells, all but one AML sample and all
AML-derived cell lines displayed increased HO-1 mRNA induction by BAY 11-7082 (Fig. 2A), which was matched in
terms of HO-1 protein levels (Fig. 2B). However, these Western blot analyses surprised us that the basal protein levels of
HO-1 in untreated AML samples were undetectable compared with untreated nonmalignant control cells. This led
us to compare basal levels of HO-1 mRNA in untreated
AML samples to nonmalignant control cells. Figure 2C shows
that basal HO-1 mRNA levels are much lower in AML blasts
compared with nonmalignant controls cells. Because HO-1 is
ubiquitously expressed throughout mammalian cell systems
and is usually highly expressed in malignant cells, these data
suggest that HO-1 is actively suppressed in AML cells.
As a positive control for HO-1 upregulation, we used the
dietary antioxidant sulforaphane, showing that 10 μmol/L
sulforaphane could induce HO-1 mRNA expression in AML

and by 16.7 ± 3.2–fold over control in primary monocytes
(means ± SEM, n = 8–17).
NF-κB suppresses HO-1 in AML. Because inhibition of
NF-κB induces HO-1 expression, we determined if NF-κB
subunits p50 and p65 were involved in the observed suppression of HO-1 in AML. Here, we used siRNA constructs to
knock down p50 and p65 in AML-derived cell line THP-1.
This experiment was also initiated to negate any nonspecific
effects of BAY 11-7082 accounting for our observations. The
THP-1 AML-derived cell line has been used throughout this

study with similar results obtained by primary AML blasts,
suggesting that THP-1 represents a valid model in which to
further study the role of NF-κB in regulating HO-1 in human
AML. The individual siRNA constructs were tested for their
ability to knock down the expression of their respective proteins. p50 and p65 siRNAs knocked down their respective
target proteins with no obvious nonspecific knockdown
effects (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, knockdown of p50 or p65 by
siRNA transfection of THP-1 cells resulted in increased HO-1
expression. This further suggests that both p50 and p65 are
involved in suppressing HO-1 levels in human AML.

HO-1 gene promoter is negatively controlled by NF-κB in
AML cells. We and others have shown that the human HO-1
promoter contains several transcription factor–binding sites,
including two κB-binding sites located downstream of the
ARE (Fig. 3A; refs. 22, 31). To determine if any of these sites
are important in the basal regulation of HO-1 in AML cells,
we created site-directed mutants of the human HO-1 promoter, which removed one or other of the κB sites
(Fig. 3A). Such site-directed mutants of the two κB sites were
also constructed within the pHO1 mutARE mutated ARE construct (Fig. 3A). To examine the functional role of these mutants compared with the wild-type promoter, we transfected
THP-1 cells with each individual construct and examined basal expression levels of luciferase report. The construct with
mutated κB1 site (construct B) had increased basal levels of
promoter activity compared with wild-type promoter construct (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, when the role of mutated κB1
in pHO1 mutARE construct was examined (construct E), we
additionally showed a similar raised basal response com-

pared with wild-type pHO1 construct, albeit with slightly less
overall luciferase activity (Fig. 3B). As a positive control for
the activation of the ARE by Nrf2, we used the antioxidant
sulforaphane, a potent inducer of phase II detoxification enzymes, to maximally induce luciferase activity of HO-1 promoter (Fig. 3B). We also showed that no effect was
observed when using HO-1 siRNA in this system (Fig. 3B).
All these results suggest that the κB site located at −2200 upstream of the transcription start site may be responsible for
the reduced expression of HO-1 in AML cells that we observe.
In vivo recruitment of p65 and p50 to the HO-1 promoter.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is a powerful
technique to determine in vivo binding of transcription factors to chromatin in intact cells. To determine the in vivo
relevance of p50 and p65 in negatively regulating basal HO-1
expression, we evaluated the recruitment of p50 and p65 to
the HO-1 promoter on cells untreated or treated with BAY
11-7082. We also analyzed recruitment of Nrf2 to these sites,
as we have shown that Nrf2 is involved in the regulation of

HO-1. ChIP assays of untreated and BAY 11-7082–treated
THP-1 cells were performed with the corresponding antibodies followed by PCR with specific primers amplifying three
regions: ARE, κB1, and κB2 (Fig. 3C). ChIP analyses revealed
that recruitment of p50 was markedly enhanced to the κB1
site on the HO-1 promoter in untreated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3C),
recruitment that was inhibited by the presence of BAY 117082. ChIP analyses also revealed that Nrf2 is recruited to
the ARE under basal conditions and is not changed by
BAY 11-7082 treatment. The results for p65 were a little
more ambiguous in that recruitment was observed but at
a much reduced level; p65 recruitment was also BAY 117082 inhibitable. Figure 3D shows the relative expression
levels of p50, p65, and Nrf2 at the ARE, κB1, and κB2 sites
in these assays using real-time PCR and further supports
the ChIP findings. What is interesting here is that we
observed p50 NF-κB1 and p65 RelA binding at the ARE
site (Fig. 3C and D), suggesting some molecular interplay
between p50, p65, ARE, and Nrf2. This clearly needs further investigation.
Inhibiting HO-1 and NF-κB in combination induces
apoptosis in AML cells. To resolve whether inhibiting
NF-κB in combination with HO-1 inhibition can induce cell

death in AML cells, AML blasts, THP-1, and CD34+ HSC were
treated with increasing concentrations of ZnPP IX (an HO-1
inhibitor) or its control compound CuPP IX. This was performed in combination with 10 μmol/L BAY 11-7082 inhibition for 24 hours. Alone, increasing concentrations of ZnPP
IX or CuPP IX had little or no effect on AML cell death; however, in combination with NF-κB inhibition, ZnPP IX but not
CuPP IX induced cell death in AML cells but not in CD34+
cells (Fig. 4A). At the highest concentration of ZnPP IX, cell
death was also observed in primary cells, suggesting that this
compound is toxic to primary cells at this higher concentration. To determine if the effects of ZnPP IX were time dependent, we analyzed its effect over a 72-hour time period at the
suboptimal concentration of 10 μmol/L on AML blasts, AML
cell lines, and nonmalignant control cells. All AML blast samples tested were susceptible to cell death from the treatment
of ZnPP IX plus BAY 11-7082 in combination but not with
either inhibitor separately (Fig. 4B). The mode of cell death
of primary cells was apoptotic, as determined by Annexin V
and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Fig. 4C). To confirm the
results observed with ZnPP IX, we also used HO-1 siRNA
knockdown in AML blasts, THP-1, and primary monocytes.

NF-κB and HO-1 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

cells in the presence of BAY 11-7082 and shows that BAY 117082 in combination with HO-1 targeted knockdown-induced
cell death of AML cells but not of the noncancerous control
cells. Thus, blockade of HO-1 activity in combination with
NF-κB inhibition is sufficient to cause cytotoxicity of AML
cells, where NF-κB inhibition alone is not.
ROS play a key role in regulating the apoptotic potential
of AML. Because it has been shown that HO-1 helps regulate
the redox equilibrium in human cells (32), and that ROS are
increased in response to NF-κB inhibition (33), the role of
ROS was examined as an inducer of apoptosis in AML cells
on both NF-κB and HO-1 inhibition. We analyzed the production of ROS in monocytes and AML cells using H2DCFDA
(a ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye) in response to NF-κB and
HO-1 inhibition. H2DCFDA oxidation occurred in response to
NF-κB inhibition and was further increased when we blocked
HO-1 expression using HO-1 siRNA (Fig. 5A). The antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has been used to quench ROS
activity within the cellular environment, blocked the apoptotic responses seen in NF-κB–inhibited and HO-1–inhibited
THP-1 and primary AML cells (Fig. 5B and C). No such
ROS effect was observed in human monocytes (Fig. 5). This
suggest that ROS are the principal effectors of apoptosis in
AML cells in response to NF-κB and HO-1 inhibition.

Discussion
The role of HO-1 in cancer biology is far from understood.
In this study, we showed that AML has low HO-1 expression
when compared with nonmalignant control cells. Interestingly, expression of HO-1 is usually increased in solid tumors
compared with surrounding healthy tissues (13). In addition,
primary chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells express HO-1
in a constitutive manner, and BCR/ABL fusion protein was
found to upregulate HO-1 production in CML cells (14). Further
work showed that targeting HO-1 activity plus imatinibinduced growth arrest in CML patient cells and imatinibresistant CML cells were killed by blocking HO-1 activity.
In this study, we show that AML samples become susceptible
to apoptotic processes in the presence of combined NF-κB
and HO-1 expression inhibition.
It is now becoming recognized that many transcription factors control the expression of the HO-1 gene. Among the transcription factors, NF-κB, Nrf2, and AP-1 families are arguably
the most important, and among the best studied, regulators of
the cellular stress response in vertebrates (21–23). Moreover,
other transcription factors, including heat shock factors, hypoxia-inducible factor-1, signal transducers and activators of
transcription proteins, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein factors, and USF family members (26), are known to regulate HO1 transcription under specific circumstances and may work in
conjunction with Nrf2, AP-1, and NF-κB (26). In addition, the
HO-1 gene is transcribed under homeostatic conditions, and
this activity is modulated in a tissue-dependent manner during development and differentiation and by stress-independent stimuli, such as growth factors (34). Thus, one
explanation for the difference of HO-1 levels in cancers cells
known to harbor high levels of NF-κB activity is that HO-1 is

www.aacrjournals.org

regulated by many different, even contrasting, factors. Combined with the local environment “niche” in which AML blasts
are produced, these facets provide unique settings to control
the regulation of gene expression in AML cells.
The signaling pathway from HO-1 to downstream apoptosis
is poorly understood in cancer cells, although there are several
publications now showing HO-1 to be antiapoptotic in several
cell types (32). The mechanism by which HO-1 protects against
apoptosis is thought to be through several different effector
pathways, including the regulation of redox-active iron (35),
heme catabolism into the gas CO that acts through the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
(36), and finally by increasing bilirubin levels, thought to provide potent scavenging potential (37). In this study, we show
that HO-1 protects AML cells from apoptosis through the
inhibition formation of ROS. However, through what pathway
this occurs is still unknown and warrants further investigation
because this could be a possible target for AML therapy.
To date, several studies have indicated that NF-κB can
control the induced expression of HO-1 (23–25). The κB site
in the HO-1 promoter, which is thought to control this induced expression, was first described by Lavrovsky and colleagues (23). One of the main arguments against HO-1
expression being controlled by this κB site at −160 is that this
site is not conserved in mammals (26). The κB site set at
−2200 is conserved in mammals,3 suggesting that this is an
important site in regulating HO-1 expression. However, one
important point to be addressed is what makes p50 and p65
actively inhibit HO-1 expression in AML cells but not in normal cells, although both proteins are active in each cell type.
One possible explanation to this is that we and other groups
have shown that there is a difference in NF-κB activity levels
between normal and AML cells under unstimulated basal
conditions. Moreover, under activated conditions, other transcription factors, such as Nrf2 and AP-1, may function
to override any suppressive NF-κB activity there is on the
HO-1 gene in normal cells.
The concept that NF-κB suppresses transcription opposes
its classic role in stimulating the transcription of target
genes. Nonetheless, several recent studies have suggested
that NF-κB may downregulate cellular responses to specific
stimuli. For example, TNF-mediated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling is enhanced in NF-κB knockout mice (38,
39). Furthermore, NF-κB has been shown to have opposing
effects on IFN-induced gene expression (40). Here, we have
shown that NF-κB suppresses basal HO-1 expression in human AML cells but not in normal nonmalignant cells. Interestingly, mutating the κB1 site but not κB2 or Nrf2 sites
causes an increase in HO-1 promoter activity. Moreover, examination of the in vivo recruitment of the κB1 site shows
that both p50 and p65 subunits bind to κB1 site in AML cells
but not in noncancerous control cells. We have also shown
that inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation using BAY 11-7082
increases HO-1 expression in AML cells but not in nonmalignant control cells. To negate any nonspecific effects of BAY

11-7082, which include inducing cell death in NF-κB–independent manner in Ewing's sarcoma (41), we also showed
that siRNA-targeted knockdown of either p50 or p65 shows
that HO-1 protein increases to levels comparable with those
seen in control nonmalignant cells. Taken together, these results show that basal HO-1 expression is under the control of
NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 in AML. Interestingly, we also
observed that p50 (and to a lesser extent p65) could bind
to the ARE site at −4100 (Fig. 3). How p50 interacts with
the ARE is unknown; however, our future studies will determine the interplay between p50, Nrf2, and ARE. This is not
the first time that another transcription factor has been associated with Nrf2 and the ARE-binding site; for example, a
recent study showed that p53 can suppress Nrf2-dependent
transcription by displacing Nrf2 bound to the promoter of
ARE-dependent genes (42). These results suggest a complexity in the transcription of HO-1, which needs further investigation especially because HO-1 is increasingly becoming a
likely target for new types of cancer therapy.
The findings we report here in this study give further support to the hypothesis that HO-1 and its transcriptional machinery have a significant role in AML; however, this role is
only revealed when you inhibit NF-κB. In summary, we have
shown that in AML-derived cells (but not their noncancerous
counterparts) HO-1 is suppressed by constitutive NF-κB activation. Furthermore, the NF-κB subunits p50/NF-κB1 and p65
seem to be responsible for this suppression of HO-1 by binding

to only one of the κB sites in the HO-1 promoter. Why this
response occurs only in these cancerous cells is unclear; however, we have shown previously that HO-1 underlies resistance
of AML cells to apoptotic stimuli. Subsequently, we hypothesize
that high basal activity of NF-κB suppresses normal apoptotic
processes in AML cells; however, if we inhibit this basal NF-κB
activity, HO-1 is subsequently induced and therefore provides
a second form of defense against anticancerous agents. Taken
together, these findings suggest that anticancer therapy needs
to target both NF-κB and HO-1 to efficiently combat AML.
