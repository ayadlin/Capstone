ABSTRACT
The transport function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) requires its efficient localization to
caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts, and disruption of caveolae suppresses P-gp transport
function. However, the regulatory molecules involved in the translocation of P-gp into
caveolae remain unknown. In the present study, we showed that c-Src dependent
Caveolin-1 phosphorylation promoted the translocation of P-gp into caveolae, resulting
in multidrug resistance in adriamycin resistant gastric cancer SGC7901/Adr and breast
cancer MCF-7/Adr cells. In a negative feedback loop, the translocation of Cbl-b from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm prevented the localization of P-gp to caveolae resulting in
the reversal of MDR through the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Src. Clinical data
showed a significant positive relationship between Cbl-b expression and survival in P-gp
positive breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Our
findings identified a new regulatory mechanism of P-gp transport function in multiple
drug-resistant gastric and breast cancers.

unrelated agents. Although several agents have been
shown to effectively reverse P-gp-mediated MDR, none
of these has been successfully developed for clinical use.
The function of P-gp as an efflux pump requires
efficient channel formation in the plasma membrane
[1, 3]. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of the plasma
membrane that are essential for the formation of P-gp
channels and play an important role in the modulation of
P-gp transport activity [4–6]. Caveolae, a type of lipid raft,
are flask-like invaginations of the plasma membrane that
serve as organizing centers for cellular signal transduction
[7]. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is the main protein constituent
of caveolae, and in vitro studies have shown that P-gp
interacts with Cav-1 through a caveolin-binding motif at
amino acids 36–44 of P-gp [8, 9]. In an in vitro model
of the blood-brain barrier, > 50% P-gp was shown to
localize to caveolae, and disruption of caveolae led to
the suppression of P-gp transport activities [10]. In drug

INTRODUCTION
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is encoded by the
multidrug resistance (MDR) gene 1, is a transmembrane
protein that is ubiquitously expressed in normal cells such
as the blood brain barrier, liver, bile ducts and kidney cells
[1]. P-gp is an ATP-dependent efflux pump that secretes
metabolites and removes toxins and drugs to protect
normal tissues from damage and maintain homeostasis.
However, the protective effect of P-gp is also an important
reason for chemotherapy failure. P-gp is overexpressed in
tumor tissues in approximately 30% of cancer patients
[2], and its expression is induced by repeated exposure
to chemotherapeutic drugs. P-gp functions by expelling
chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines, alkaloids
and taxanes from the tumor cells, which is the basis of
MDR, a phenomenon by which tumor cells, upon contact
with one anticancer agent, become resistant to other

resistant cancer cells, P-gp was shown to be upregulated
and localized to caveolae in association with its function
in mediating MDR [11]. Therefore, caveolae provide a
critical platform for P-gp, and the translocation of P-gp
into caveolae might be a regulatory switch for its transport
activity. Despite the importance of caveolae in membrane
transport, studies on the translocation of functional
molecules into caveolae are limited. Bizet et al. reported
that CD109 increases binding of TGF-β to its receptor and
enhances its translocation into caveolae [12]. Dittmann et
al. reported that Src kinase activation following irradiation
triggers Cav-1 dependent EGFR internalization into
caveolae. However, little is known about the molecules
regulating the translocation of P-gp into caveolae [13].
The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the main
intracellular pathway modulating protein turnover. The UPS
regulates the activity of P-gp by modulating P-gp levels
[14]. Katayama et al. reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase
FBXO15 ubiquitinates P-gp and targets it for degradation
[15]. Recent work from our group demonstrated that
Cbl-b, a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases,
downregulates P-gp expression by suppressing Akt
activation [16], suggesting that the UPS regulates P-gp
levels and thus its function. However, other studies showed
that the UPS modulates P-gp function by regulating its
localization to lipid rafts. The E3 ligase Trc8 inhibits the
transporter function of P-gp by inhibiting the localization of
Pgp and MRP1 to lipid rafts and cholesterol synthesis [17].
We previously reported that Cbl-b is also a strong inhibitor
of lipid raft aggregation, and prevents EGFR and its related
signaling molecules from translocating into caveolae [18,
19]. Therefore, we speculated that Cbl-b might play a role
in regulating the transport activity of P-gp by modulating
its translocation into caveolae.
In the present study, we showed that c-Src dependent
Cav-1 phosphorylation promoted the translocation of P-gp
into caveolae, inducing MDR in gastric cancer SGC7901/
Adr and breast cancer MCF-7/Adr cells. The translocation
of Cbl-b from the nucleus to the cytoplasm prevented the
translocation of P-gp into caveolae and reversed MDR
through the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Src.
Analysis of clinical data showed that Cbl-b expression
is significantly associated with survival in P-gp positive
patients who received anthracycline based chemotherapy.
Our findings suggest a novel mechanism regulating the
transport function of P-gp.

gastric cancer cells (Figure 1A). Similar results were
obtained in MCF-7/Adr breast cancer cells (Figure 1A).
Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the Dox induced
translocation of P-gp to aggregated lipid rafts, and this was
inhibited by treatment with 50 μg/ml nystatin, a cholesterolsequestering agent that disrupts lipid rafts (Figure 1B).
P-gp function was assessed by measuring Dox uptake and
retention, which showed that pretreatment with 50 μg/ml
nystatin increased retention and inhibited the release of
Dox and sensitized SGC7901/Adr and MCF7/Adr cells to
Dox (Figure 1C). These findings suggest that P-gp transport
function is dependent on its localization to lipid rafts.
Because caveolae are a type of lipid raft that play
an important role in signal transduction, we investigated
their potential as a target domain for the translocation of
P-gp by detecting the interaction between P-gp and Cav-1,
a marker of caveolae, using the PLA. The results showed
that treatment with 20 μg/ml Dox for 5 min promoted a
significant and rapid interaction between P-gp and Cav-1
in SGC7901/Adr and MCF-7/Adr cells (Figure 1D). Small
interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated knock-down of Cav-1
markedly increased the intracellular retention of Dox in
SGC7901/Adr cells (Figure 1E). These data suggested that
the translocation of P-gp into caveolae is necessary for
MDR in cancer cells.

c-Src dependent Cav-1 phosphorylation
promotes the translocation of P-gp into caveolae
Because the Src family of tyrosine kinases is present
in lipid rafts, we detected c-Src activation in response to
Dox treatment in SGC7901/Adr cells. The results indicated
that 20 μg/ml Dox triggered a transient activation of
c-Src, which reached a peak at 5 min despite a decrease
in total c-Src levels (Figure 2A). Cav-1 was activated at
5 min, which was later than c-Src activation. PP2, a specific
inhibitor of c-Src kinase, markedly suppressed Cav-1
phosphorylation (Figure 2B). Immunoprecipitation of
P-gp and detection of Cav-1 showed that Dox treatment
promoted P-gp/Cav-1 complex formation after 5 min, and
PP2 suppressed the formation of the P-gp/Cav-1 complex
(Figure 2C). Immunofluorescence assays further confirmed
that PP2 prevented the interaction between P-gp and Cav-1
(Figure 2D). Consequently, the intracellular retention of
Dox was increased in SGC7901/Adr cells (Figure 2E).
These results indicated that c-Src promoted the translocation
of P-gp into caveolae by activating Cav-1 and promoted the
retention of Dox in SGC7901/Adr and MCF-7/Adr cells.

proteasome inhibitor PS34 effectively prevented c-Src
degradation in SGC7901/Adr cells (Figure 3B). These
findings suggested that Dox promoted the degradation of
c-Src in a UPS dependent manner.
Cbl-b is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to
numerous proteins and mediates their ubiquitination and
degradation. To determine whether Cbl-b is involved in
the regulation of c-Src stability, SGC7901/Adr cells were
treated with 20 μg/ml Dox for the indicated times and the
interaction between c-Src and Cbl-b was demonstrated by
co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 3C).
To determine whether c-Src is ubiquitinated
by Cbl-b in response to Dox, Cbl-b was silenced in
SGC7901/Adr cells by transfection with siRNA Cbl-b,
which significantly inhibited Dox-induced ubiquitination
and degradation of c-Src (Figure 3D). This result was
confirmed by overexpression of wild-type Cbl-b, which
significantly enhanced Dox-induced c-Src ubiquitination.
Cbl-b (C373A), which lost its ubiquitin-protein ligase

function by a point mutation of Cys373 to Ala, abolished
this enhancement (Supplementary Figure 2A–2B, available
online). Protein interactions between P-gp and Cav-1 were
tested by the PLA. The results showed that knockdown
of Cbl-b significantly increased the interaction between
P-gp and Cav-1 in SGC7901/Adr cells (Figure 3E), and
promoted the release of Dox (Figure 3F). These results
indicated that Cbl-b could inhibit the transport activity of
P-gp through the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Src.
The localization of Cbl-b in P-gp positive and
negative cells was analyzed by western blotting (Figure
4A). In SGC7901/Adr cells, Cbl-b was mainly detected
in the nucleus, whereas in parental SGC7901 cells, it was
mostly detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 4B). Western
blotting also showed that Dox (20 μg/ml) rapidly triggered
Cbl-b translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm in a
time-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Low dose Dox
(2 μg/ml) could not trigger Cbl-b translocation from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 3,
available online).

patients treated with an anthracycline-based
regimen

levels of P-gp had no significant influence on survival in
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (Supplementary
Figure 4, available online). Survival analysis was
performed in 121 patient samples (37.9%) that were
positive for P-gp, which showed a statistically significant
difference in disease-free survival (DFS) and diseasespecific survival (DSS) between 73 patients whose tumors
were positive for Cbl-b expression and 48 patients whose
tumors were negative for Cbl-b expression as estimated
with the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test (Table 1,
Figure 6B). Our results indicate that decreased expression
of Cbl-b is associated with poor prognosis in patients with
drug resistant breast cancer. Taken together, these findings
suggest that Cbl-b may play a role in tumor MDR.

The findings that Cbl-b could overcome Dox
resistance in vitro were further explored by in vivo nude
mice xenograft studies. Stable SGC7901/Adr cell lines
overexpressing Cbl-b/pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 alone
were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of athymic
nude mice. After tumors reached approximately 100 mm3
(7 days), the animals received intraperitoneal injection of
either PBS or Dox (6 mg/kg) once per week. The results
showed that in SGC7901/Adr+Cbl-b mice treated with
Dox, tumor growth was significantly inhibited compared
with that in the other three groups (Figure 5A–5D).
We also determined whether Cbl-b expression was
associated with the clinical outcomes of patients with
breast cancer. To this end, tumor samples from 211 breast
cancer patients were collected for immunohistochemistry
using anti-Cbl-b and anti-P-gp antibodies (Figure 6A). The

Cav-1, and phosphorylation of Cav-1 is required for this
interaction [20, 21]. To date, c-Src is the only kinase
known to phosphorylate Cav-1 [22]. c-Src phosphorylates
Cav-1 and promotes its interaction with VEGFR2 or
EGFR, leading to their localization to caveolae [23, 24].
In the present study, we showed that treatment with Dox
triggered the phosphorylation of Cav-1 by c-Src and the
translocation of P-gp to caveolae. PP2, a specific inhibitor
of c-Src, inhibited Cav-1 phosphorylation and prevented
the translocation of P-gp, simultaneously increasing
intracellular retention of Dox in the adriamycin resistant
cell lines SGC7901/Adr and MCF-7/Adr. These findings
suggested that c-Src-dependent Cav-1 phosphorylation
drives the translocation of P-gp into caveolae, eventually
resulting in MDR.
In the present study, we identified a novel feedback
regulatory mechanism for the translocation of P-gp into
caveolae. c-Src dependent Cav-1 phosphorylation is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

necessary for the translocation of P-gp into caveolae;
therefore, molecules affecting the expression and
activation of c-Src could play a regulatory role in this
translocation. The stability of c-Src is regulated by the
UPS in some cells [25, 26], and the E3 ligase c-Cbl was
shown to ubiquitinate and target c-Src for degradation in
response to TRAIL treatment [27]. c-Cbl and Cbl-b belong
to the same ubiquitin ligase family, and have a similar
protein domain structure [28], implying that Cbl-b might
also be involved in the regulation of c-Src. In the present
study, Dox treatment promoted the rapid downregulation
of c-Src in a UPS dependent manner. Knockdown of Cbl-b
significantly inhibited c-Src ubiquitination and degradation
and promoted the translocation of P-gp to caveolae,
whereas Cbl-b overexpression prevented the translocation
of P-gp to caveolae. These results indicated that Cbl-b
may reverse P-gp-mediated MDR by suppressing the
c-Src/Cav-1 induced translocation of P-gp to caveolae.

As a cytosolic protein, c-Src normally functions
in the proximity of or in the plasma membrane. In the
present study, we showed that a significant proportion of
Cbl-b localized to the nucleus in untreated MDR cells. A
potential nuclear localization signal in Cbl-b was reported
by Keane MM [28]. Since these two proteins localize
to different cellular compartments, the mechanism
underlying the regulation of c-Src by Cbl-b is not clear.
Furthermore, our data showed that Cbl-b translocates from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to Dox treatment.
Cytoplasmic Cbl-b promoted c-Src ubiquitination and
degradation, and inhibited the translocation of P-gp into
caveolae, resulting in the reversal of MDR. To date, there
are no reports describing the nuclear localization of Cbl-b
or that of other Cbl family proteins. The present study is
the first to show the nuclear localization and Dox-induced
nucleus to cytoplasm translocation of Cbl-b. However,
elucidation of the mechanism of Cbl-b translocation
requires further investigation.
P-gp overexpression is an important mechanism
of MDR and it has been described in numerous studies.
However, previous clinical data suggest that the levels of
P-gp have no significant influence on survival in cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy [29]. This implies
that other as yet unidentified factors may be involved in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the regulation of P-gp function and affect the survival
of P-gp positive patients. Our in vitro and animal
experiments confirmed the effect of P-gp overexpression
on the development of MDR. However, our clinical data
showed that P-gp alone had no effect on DFS or DSS in
breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, whereas Cbl-b significantly prolonged the
survival of P-gp positive patients. Our previous studies
showed that Cbl-b reverses P-gp-mediated MDR by
downregulating P-gp expression. Furthermore, previous
studies have shown that Cbl-b reverses P-gp-mediated
MDR by inhibiting the translocation of P-gp into caveolae.
These results suggest that even in P-gp positive cancer
patients, Cbl-b is associated with a survival benefit.
Therefore, detection of Cbl-b and P-gp in combination
could be a valuable prognostic marker in cancer patients
who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
In summary, our study provided evidence that
c-Src dependent Cav-1 phosphorylation promotes the
translocation of P-gp into caveolae, leading to MDR. We
also identified a novel negative feedback loop by which the
translocation of Cbl-b from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
prevents the c-Src/Cav-1 dependent translocation of P-gp
into caveolae, overcoming MDR (Figure 6C). Clinical
data confirmed that Cbl-b significantly prolonged survival

Immunohistochemistry

Science (Beijing, China). The adriamycin-resistant variant
of SGC7901 (SGC7901/Adr) was kindly provided by the
Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an, China). The
adriamycin-resistant variant of MCF-7 (MCF-7/Adr)
was established by selecting for resistant colonies by
first culturing the parent cell line in 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin
(Dox). The drug-containing medium was changed weekly,
and colonies that had propagated from single cells were
selected. Clonal cell lines expanded from such a colony
were subsequently selected in 1 μg/ml Dox (MCF-7/Adr).
All cell lines were grown at 37°C and in 5% CO2.
SGC7901 and SGC7901/Adr cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. MCF-7 and MCF-7/Adr cells
were maintained in MEM media (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/
ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential
amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and MEM vitamin
solution. In the two drug-resistant variant cell lines, the
medium additionally contained 1 μg/ml Dox to maintain the
drug resistance phenotype (Supplementary Figure 1A–1B,
available online).

Immunohistochemical staining was performed using
a streptavidin-peroxidase procedure [16]. Cbl-b and P-gp
expression was investigated using antibodies against
Cbl-b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
and P-gp (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All other reagents
were from Sigma. The specificity of all antibodies was
confirmed by western blotting. For statistical analysis,
immunostaining was considered positive when the tumour
mass occupied more than 10% of the cross-sectional core
area and when 10% or more of the neoplastic cells were
stained.

Scoring
Protein expression in each core (three per tumor
specimen) was assessed using the weighted histoscore
method [16]. The weighted histoscore system grades
staining intensity as negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2),
and strong (3), and the percentages of tumor cells within
each category are calculated. The histoscore range is from
zero (minimum) to 300 (maximum). Agreement between
observers was excellent and all interclass correlation
coefficient scores were above 0.84.

Cell transfection

2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted drop-wise into RPMI 1640
and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Then, Cav-1
siRNA was added to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 and
incubated for 20 min. After 48 h of transient transfection,
the cells were analyzed by western blotting against Cav-1
to assess the siRNA effect.

SGC7901/Adr cells were plated in six-well
plates and cultured in drug-free medium. At 90–95%
confluence, cells were washed twice with PBS and
incubated in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium without
antibiotics. Transfection of SGC7901/Adr cells was
performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 2 μg of
pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) including the full-length
cDNA for Cbl-b. Cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1
vector alone served as the negative control. Fortyeight hours later, cells were placed in growth medium
containing 600 μg/ml of the neomycin analogue G418
(Life Technologies) for clone selection. Expression
levels of Cbl-b in stable G418-resistant clones were
evaluated by western blotting.

Construction of DNA
The human Cbl-b cDNA was kindly provided by
Dr Stanley Lipkowitz (National Naval Medical Center,
Bethesda, MD, USA). The cDNA of Cbl-b was then
used to generate its mutant form, which lost its ubiquitinprotein ligase function by a point mutation of Cys373 to
Ala (C373A) [19]. All mutations were confirmed by DNA
sequencing. All cDNAs were then subcloned into the
pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen).

Isolation of lipid rafts

Immunofluorescence microscopy

The cells were solubilised in 150 μL of prechilled
TXNE buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing
protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain,
and pepstatin, at 25 mg/mL each) for 20 min on ice.
Subsequently, the cells were scraped off, extracted and
moved into 35% Optiprep (Axis-shield, Norway) in
polyallomer ultra tubes (Sorvall Instruments, USA) by
adding 210 μL of 60% Optiprep/0.1% Triton X-100.
Then the cell lystaes were covered with 3.5 mL 30%
Optiprep in TXNE buffer and 300 μL TXNE buffer. After
spin (4 h, 20,0000 g, 4°C) in the ultracentrifuge (Sorvall/
Kendro, USA), six fractions were collected from the top.
The proteins in fractions 1–2 were collected and were
taken as the lipid raft fractions.

Cells cultured in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc
S/A, Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) were fixed with
3.3% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100/PBS, and washed with PBS three times.
For double staining of lipid rafts and P-gp, the cells were
primed with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-cholera toxin
B subunit, anti-P-gp mouse monoclonal antibody for
1 h and then incubated with Alexa Fluor&reg 405 goat
anti-mouse IgG for 45 min. Merged images display the
overlay of blue P-gp staining of membrane, green lipid
rafts staining and red autofluorescence of DOX. Finally,
the cells were mounted using the SlowFade Antifade Kit
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by confocal
fluorescence microscopy (FV1000S-SIM/IX81, Olympus,
Japan).

Lysate preparation, immunoprecipitation, and
immunoblotting

Dox uptake and retention
The intracellular uptake and retention of Dox in
SGC7901/Adr and MCF-7/Adr cells was measured by
flow cytometry as previously described [30]. Briefly,
cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well
in 24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. After
attachment, media were removed and replaced with
fresh full-growth media and treatments were added for a
30 min preincubation period. After 30 min, media were
replaced with fresh media containing treatments and Dox
(20 μg/ml). Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h.
For uptake studies, cells were placed on ice at the end of
the 1 h Dox uptake incubation period, washed twice with
ice-cold Hanks buffer, and intracellular Dox was extracted
with 0.1% SDS in PBS. Fluorescence was measured at k
excitation 488 nm/k emission 575 nm using a fluorescent
microplate reader. For retention assays, following the 1 h
Dox uptake incubation, media were removed, cells were
washed twice with fresh media, and then fresh media
with the respective treatments were added and cells were
incubated for a further 2 h. One set of wells without
treatment was immediately washed and Dox was extracted
following the 1 h uptake incubation to serve as uptake
controls. At the end of the 2 h efflux incubation period,
intracellular Dox was determined as outlined above. For
comparison, the intracellular Dox at the end of the efflux
period was compared with the intracellular Dox at the end
of the uptake period (100% uptake) for each individual
cell line.

Lysate preparation and protein immunoprecipitation
were performed as described previously [18]. Cells were
washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and solubilized in 1% Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton
X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM
EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/
ml aprotinin) on ice. For immunoprecipitation with anti–
P-gp or anti-c-Src, cells were solubilized in denaturing
buffer (1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing
0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholic acid) to dissociate
protein complexes. Cell lysates were precleared by
centrifugation, and the resultant supernatants were
incubated with the indicated antibodies prebound to
protein A-agarose or protein G-sepharose beads. After
rotation for 1 h at 4°C, the beads were washed four times
with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins
were eluted by heat treatment at 100°C for 5 min with
2 × sampling buffer.
Total cell lysates, immunoprecipitated proteins,
and subcellular fractions were separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking with
5% skim milk in TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, and 0.1% Tween20), the blots were probed with
the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at 4°C. After
washing with TBST, the membrane was reacted with
the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature.
After extensive washing with TBST buffer, the proteins
were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent (SuperSignal Western Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate; Pierce, USA) and visualized with the
Electrophoresis Gel Imaging Analysis System (DNR
Bio-Imaging Systems, Israel).

Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins
The cytosolic and nuclear proteins were prepared as
described previously [32]. Briefly, the cell pellets (1 × 106
cells) were treated with 100 μl of hypotonic buffer
(10 mM HEPES at pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride
[PMSF], 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After
centrifugation of the sample (1800 g, 4°C, 1 min), the
supernatant and debris were collected as rough cytosolic
and nuclear fractions, respectively. The rough cytosolic
fractions were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min and
100,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The final supernatant was
collected as the cytosolic fraction for use in the following
study. The rough nuclear fractions were washed three
times with hypotonic buffer and treated with 100 μl of 50
mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 420 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1
mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 μg/
ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin and were then gently
rotated with a rotator at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant
was collected as the nuclear fraction.

Antitumor assays using mouse models
All in vivo experiments were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of China Medical University.
Athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, 4–6 weeks of age, were
purchased from SLAC Animal Center (Shanghai, China).
SGC7901/Adr-Vector and SGC7901/Adr-Cbl-b cells
(1 × 106 in 200 μl PBS) were injected subcutaneously
near the scapula of the nude mice. One week after the
cells were injected, the mice were randomly separated
into two groups, each containing five mice, and treated
with PBS or Dox (6 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection
once per week. Tumors were measured with a caliper
every 2 days, and tumor volume was calculated using the
formula V = 1/2 (width2 × length). Body weights were
also recorded. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation
when the tumor diameters reached 1.5 cm, according
to the protocol filed with the Guidance of Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical
University.
