Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Urothelial Bladder
Carcinoma

Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000
deaths per year worldwide. To date, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for the
disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131
urothelial carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were

statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell
cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signaling pathways, as well as 9 genes not
previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four
expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in
miRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent inframe activating FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses
(including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential
therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin
regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any common
cancer studied to date, suggesting the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin
abnormalities.

Introduction
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
causing an estimated 150,000 deaths per year1. Previous studies have identified multiple
regions of somatic copy number alteration, including amplification of PPARG, E2F3,
EGFR, CCND1 and MDM2, as well as loss of CDKN2A and RB12,3. Sequencing of
candidate pathways has identified recurrent mutations in TP53, FGFR3, PIK3CA, TSC1,
RB1 and HRAS2,3. More recently, a candidate gene study identified mutations at >10%
frequency in several chromatin remodeling genes: KDM6A, CREBBP, EP300, and
ARID1A4. Focused molecular analyses5,6 have delineated tumour subtypes and identified
kinase-activating FGFR3 gene fusions7,8.

We report here a comprehensive, integrated study of 131 high-grade muscle-invasive
urothelial bladder carcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.
Included are data on DNA copy number, somatic mutation, mRNA and microRNA
expression, protein and phosphorylated protein expression, DNA methylation, transcript
splice variation, gene fusion, viral integration, pathway perturbation, clinical correlates and
histopathology to characterize the molecular landscape of urothelial carcinoma. This study
identifies a number of mutations and regions of copy number variation that involve genes
not previously reported as altered in a significant fraction of bladder cancers. It also
identifies potential therapeutic targets in most of the samples analyzed.

Demographic, clinical and pathological data
Samples, (from 19 tissue source sites), consisted of 131 chemotherapy-naïve, muscleinvasive, high-grade urothelial tumours (T2-T4a, Nx, Mx), as well as peripheral blood
(n=118) and/or tumour-adjacent, histologically normal-appearing bladder tissue (n=23).
Cases were retained only if they met the following criteria: tumour nuclei constituted ≥ 60%
of all nuclei, tumour necrosis was ≤ 20% of the specimen, and variant histologies (squamous
or small cell) were ≤50% (Supplementary Text S1). Clinical and demographic
characteristics are described in Supplementary Data File S1.1. Five expert genitourinary

pathologists re-reviewed all of the cases for multiple parameters, including the extent of
variant histology (Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S1.1a).
Somatic DNA alterations

Author Manuscript

The tumours displayed a large number of DNA alterations, slightly fewer than in lung
cancer and melanoma, but more than in other adult malignancies studied by TCGA (Fig. 1)9.
On average, there were 302 exonic mutations, 204 segmental alterations in genomic copy
number and 22 genomic rearrangements per sample. We analyzed somatic copy number
alterations (SCNAs) using both SNP 6.0 arrays and low-pass whole genome sequencing; the
two were strongly concordant (Supplementary Methods S6.1 and Supplementary Fig. S6.1).
There were 22 significant arm-level copy number changes (Supplementary Data File
S6.1.1), and GISTIC (Supplementary Methods S6.2) identified 27 amplified and 30 deleted
recurrent focal SCNAs (Supplementary Data Files S6.2.1 and S6.3.1). Focal amplifications
involved genes previously reported to be altered in bladder cancer (Fig. 1c, Supplementary
Fig. S6.2.1) and some not previously implicated. The latter included PVRL4, BCL2L1 and
ZNF703. The most common recurrent focal deletion, seen in 47% of samples, contained
CDKN2A (9p21.3) and correlated with reduced expression (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig.
S2.7). Other focal deletions containing <10 genes appeared to target PDE4D, RB1, FHIT,
CREBBP, IKZF2, FOXQ1, FAM190A, LRP1B and WWOX.

Author Manuscript

Whole-exome sequencing of 130 tumours and matched normal samples targeted 186,260
exons in 18,091 genes (mean coverage 100×, with 82% of target bases covered >30×).
MuTect10 identified 39,312 somatic mutations (including 38,012 point mutations and 1,138
indels), yielding mean and median somatic mutation rates of 7.7 and 5.5 per megabase (Mb),
respectively (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S2.1.1). Thirty-two genes showed statistically
significant levels of recurrent somatic mutation (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table S2.1.2) by
analysis using MutSig 1.511 (Supplementary Methods S2.2). Three other genes identified by
MutSig were not considered further because of low or undetectable expression
(Supplementary Fig. S2.1.1). A similar analysis considering only mutations in the COSMIC
database2 identified three more significantly mutated genes (SMGs): ERBB2, ATM and
CTNNB1 (Supplementary Table S2.1.3). We validated the mutation findings in three ways:
targeted re-sequencing of all SMG mutations, comparison with RNA-Seq data for 123
samples and comparison with whole genome sequence data for 18 samples. Overall, the
validation rate was > 99% by a combination of the methods (Supplemental Methods S2.4.)

Author Manuscript

Nearly half (49%) of the samples had TP53 mutations (Fig. 1b), which were mutually
exclusive in their relationship with amplification (9%) and overexpression (29%) of MDM2;
hence, TP53 function was inactivated in 76% of samples. Most RB1 mutations were
inactivating, were associated with significantly reduced mRNA level (Supplementary Fig.
S2.7) and were mutually exclusive with CDKN2A deletions (Supplementary Fig. S2.8 and
Table S2.8.1). FGFR3 mutations (12%) typically affected known kinase-activating sites.
PIK3CA mutations were relatively common (20%), clustering in the helical domain near
E545 (Supplementary Fig. S2.4). Most TSC1 mutations (8%) were truncating, and six were
homozygous (allele fraction > 0.5).

Many of the 32 genes identified in Fig. 1b have not previously been reported as statistically
significantly mutated in bladder cancer: MLL2 (27%), CDKN1A* (14%), ERCC2* (12%),
STAG2 (11%), RXRA* (9%), ELF3* (8%), NFE2L2 (8%), KLF5* (8%), TXNIP (7%),
FOXQ1* (5%), RHOB* (5%), FOXA1 (5%), PAIP1* (5%), BTG2* (5%), ZFP36L1 (5%),
RHOA (4%) and CCND3 (4%). The nine genes marked with asterisks have not been
reported as SMGs in any other TCGA cancer type or reported in another study as mutated at
>3% frequency2. CDKN1A (p21CIP1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor12, had
predominantly null or truncating mutations, implying loss of function. Fifteen of 16
mutations in ERCC2, a nucleotide excision repair gene13, were deleterious missense
mutations, suggesting dominant negative effects. ERCC2-mutant tumours also had
significantly fewer C>G mutations than did ERCC2-wild type tumours (Supplementary
Figs. S2.3.1 and S2.3.2), and they trended toward higher overall mutation rate
(Supplementary Figure S2.12). Seven of 12 mutations in RXRA (retinoid × nuclear receptor
alpha)14 occurred at the same amino acid (five S427F; two S427Y) in the ligand-binding
domain. Those seven tumours showed increased expression of genes involved in
adipogenesis and lipid metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S2.6 and Data Files S2.6.1- S2.6.3),
suggesting that the mutations cause constitutive activation.

Author Manuscript

Eleven tumours (8%) had deleterious missense mutations in the Neh2 domain of NFE2L2, a
transcription factor that regulates the anti-oxidant program in response to oxidative stress15.
Those tumours showed dramatically increased expression of genes involved in genotoxic
metabolism and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) response (Supplementary Figs. S2.5.1S2.5.3 and Date File S2.5.2). Furthermore, nine samples had mutations in redox regulator
TXNIP16 (5 of them inactivating) and were mutually exclusive of samples with NFE2L2
mutations, providing another mechanism for dysregulation of redox metabolism.
Predominant inactivating mutations were seen in STAG2, an X-linked cohesin complex
component required for separation of sister chromatids during cell division17
(Supplementary Fig. S2.4).

Author Manuscript

Unsupervised clustering by non-negative matrix factorization of mutations and focal SCNAs
in 125 samples identified three distinct groups (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S2.1.2). Group
A (red), labeled as ‘focally-amplified’, is highly enriched in focal SCNAs in several genes,
as well as mutations in MLL2 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Tables S2.1.4 and S2.1.5). Group B
(blue), labeled as ‘papillary CDKN2A-deficient FGFR3-mutant‘, is enriched in papillary
histology. Nearly all Group B samples show loss of CDKN2A, and the majority have one or
more alterations in FGFR3. Group C (green), labeled as ‘TP53/cell-cycle-mutant’, shows
TP53 mutations in nearly all samples, as well as enrichment with RB1 mutations and
amplifications of E2F3 and CCNE1 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S2.1.4). Those differences
in pattern of mutation suggest the possibility of different oncogenic mechanisms.
Seventy-two per cent of the cancers in this study were from current or past smokers,
consistent with extensive epidemiological studies indicating an association between smoking
and urothelial cancer risk. In contrast with lung cancer, however, there was no statistically
significant association between smoking status and the mutational spectrum, frequency of
mutation in any SMG, focal SCNAs or expression subtype (Supplementary Tables S2.9.1
and S2.9.2). Never-smokers did have a slightly higher fraction of C>G mutations than did

current/former smokers (28.5% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.032; Supplementary Figs. 2.3.2 and 2.3.3).
However, unsupervised clustering of promoter CpG island DNA methylation data revealed a
major subgroup (34%) of tumours characterized by cancer-specific DNA hypermethylation
(CIMP) (Supplementary Fig.S7.1). Multivariate regression analysis with age, sex and
tumour stage as covariates identified smoking pack-years as the only significant predictor of
CIMP phenotype, as has also been reported for colorectal cancer18.
Fifty-one per cent of mutations overall were Tp*C->(T/G) (Supplementary Table S2.1.1), a
class of mutation recently reported to be mediated by one of the DNA cytosine deaminases,
APOBEC19,20. APOBEC3B was expressed at high levels in all of the tumours, suggesting a
major role for APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in bladder carcinogenesis (Supplementary
Figs. S12.1 and S12.2).

Four genes involved in epigenetic regulation were SMGs: MLL2, ARID1A, KDM6A and
EP300 (Fig. 1). Truncating mutations were significantly enriched in each of those genes
(Supplementary Fig. S2.2 and Data Files S2.2.1-2). Three of them had previously been
identified as mutated in urothelial cancers4, but mutation of MLL2, which encodes a histone
H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, is a novel finding. Several other chromatinregulating genes had mutation rates ≥10% but were not statistically significant by MutSig
analysis: MLL3, MLL, CREBBP, CHD7 and SRCAP. Many other epigenetic regulators were
mutated at lower frequency but were also enriched with truncating mutations, suggesting
functional significance (Supplementary Fig. S2.2 and Data Files S2.2.1 and S2.2.2). Nonsilent mutations in chromatin regulatory genes overall were significantly enriched in bladder
cancer in comparison with the entire exome, in contrast with all other epithelial cancers
studied to date in the TCGA project (Supplementary Table S2.10). Mutations in MLL2 and
KDM6A (the latter encoding a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase) were mutually
exclusive (Supplementary Fig. S2.8 and Table S2.8.1), suggesting that mutations in the two
genes have redundant downstream effects on carcinogenesis or that the combined loss is
synthetically lethal.
Chromosomal rearrangements and viral integration

Author Manuscript

To identify structural variations and pathogen sequences, we used low-pass, paired-end,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS; 6-8× coverage) of 114 tumours and RNA sequencing of
all tumours. We detected 2,529 structural aberrations, including 1,153 that involve genegene fusions. Among the translocations, 379 were inter-chromosomal, 237 were intrachromosomal, 274 were the result of inversions and 263 resulted from deletions
(Supplementary Table S3.1). We found several recurrent translocations of likely pathogenic
significance, including an intra-chromosomal translocation on chromosome 4 involving
FGFR3 and TACC3 (n=3). The breakpoints were in intron 16 (2 cases) or exon 17 (1 case)
of FGFR3 and intron 10 of TACC3 (confirmed by DNA sequencing and RNA-seq). All
three lead to fusion mRNA products whose predicted proteins include the N-terminal 758
amino acids of FGFR3 fused with the C-terminal 191 amino acids of TACC3 (Fig. 2a).
Based on the structure of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein, we predict that it can autodimerize, leading to constitutive activation of the kinase domain of FGFR3. FGFR3-TACC3
fusion, which was recently described in both glioblastoma21 and bladder cancer7,8,

represents a promising therapeutic target. The ERBB2 gene was also involved in
translocations in four tumours, all with different fusion partners and all confirmed by DNA
sequencing, RNA-Seq or both. In one case, exons 4 to 29 of ERBB2 were fused to the
promoter plus exon 1 of DIP2B, and the fusion product was amplified (Fig. 2b). Two other
fusion products resulted in novel mRNA products whose biological significance is not
known.

Author Manuscript

We identified viral DNAs in 7 of 122 tumours (6%), and viral transcripts in 5 of 122 (4%).
Three tumours expressed cytomegalovirus (CMV) transcripts (encoding RL5A, RNA2.7,
RL9A, RNA1.2, UL5 and UL22A), one expressed BK polyoma virus and one expressed
human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16). HPV16 and human herpes virus 6B DNA were each
identified in one other sample but without expression. None of the tumours expressing CMV
showed evidence of CMV integration into the host genome, suggesting the presence of a
stable episome. In the BK-positive tumour, two BK genes were integrated into GRB14, a
signaling adapter protein for receptor tyrosine kinases. In the HPV 16-expressing case, the
virus integrated into BCL2L1, an apoptosis-regulating gene (Fig. 2c). In that tumour,
BCL2L1 was amplified (∼6×) and overexpressed (∼10× median; > 2× any of the other
samples). Overall, those findings suggest that viral infection may play a role in the
development of a small percentage of urothelial carcinomas.
mRNA, microRNA and protein expression

Author Manuscript

Analysis of RNA-seq data from 129 tumours identified four clusters (clusters I-IV) (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Fig. S4.1). Cluster I (‘papillary-like’) is enriched in tumours with
papillary morphology (p=0.0002), FGFR3 mutations (p=0.0007, q=0.02), FGFR3 copy
number gain (p=0.04, q=0.1) and elevated FGFR3 expression (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3a). It
includes all three samples with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions. Cluster I samples also show
significantly lower expression of miR-99a and miR-100, microRNAs that down-regulate
FGFR3 expression (p=0.0002, Figs. 3a S5.3)22. They also show lower expression of
miR-145 and miR-125b, which have been reported as frequently downregulated in bladder
cancer23. Tumours with FGFR3 alterations, and perhaps other tumours that share the Cluster
I expression profile, may respond to inhibitors of FGFR or its downstream targets.
Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data indicate that clusters I and II express high HER2
(ERBB2) levels and an elevated estrogen receptor beta (ESR1) signaling signature,
indicating potential targets for hormone therapies such as tamoxifen or raloxifene (Fig. 3d).
In fact, the HER2 protein levels in a subset of the tumours are comparable to those found in
TCGA HER2-positive breast cancers23.

Author Manuscript

For comparison, we asked whether any of the four clusters show gene signatures similar to
those identified in any other tumour type(s) among the first 11 analyzed by TCGA. We
found that the signature of bladder cancer cluster III (‘basal/squamous-like’) is similar to
that of basal-like breast cancers, as well as squamous cell cancers of the head and neck and
lung (Supplementary Fig. S4.2)24,25. All four of those cancer types express characteristic
epithelial lineage genes, including KRT14, KRT5, KRT6 and EGFR. Basal-like subtype26
and squamous cell subtype27 of urothelial carcinoma, have been independently reported.
Many of the samples in bladder cluster III express cytokeratins (i.e. KRT14 and KRT5) that

were recently reported to mark stem/progenitor cells26. Some of those samples also show a
level of variant squamous histology (Fig. 3b). Bladder clusters I and II show features similar
to those of Luminal A breast cancer, with high mRNA and protein expression of luminal
breast differentiation markers, including GATA3 and FOXA1 (Fig. 3c). Markers of
urothelial differentiation such as the uroplakins are also highly expressed in clusters I and II,
as are the epithelial marker E-cadherin and members of the miR-200 family of microRNAs
(which target multiple regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition)28 (Fig. 3c). Taken
together, those observations suggest that, despite their diverse tissue origins, some bladder,
breast, head and neck and lung cancers share common pathways of tumour development.

Author Manuscript

To determine if the expression-based clusters could be seen in other datasets, we used the
muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples from Sjodahl, et al.27, hierarchically clustering
them with the genes used in our analysis. From the sample dendrogram, we identified four
groups (Supplemental Figure S4.3a). The four groups identified in the Sjodahl data set
correlated well with the four clusters identified in our TCGA data. (Supplemental Figure
S4.3b).
When we analyzed the RNA-seq data for transcript splice variation using SpliceSeq29
(Supplemental Material S11), one finding of interest was an average of 3% PKM1 and 97%
PKM2 transcripts in the tumour samples. The PKM2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is the
principal driver of a shift to aerobic glycolysis in tumours (the Warburg effect)30. Therefore,
urothelial bladder cancers (and other cancer types) may prove sensitive to inhibition of
glycolysis or related metabolic pathways.
Pathway analysis and therapeutic targeting

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Integrated analysis of the mutation and copy-number data revealed three main pathways as
frequently dysregulated in bladder cancer: cell cycle regulation (altered in 93% of cases);
kinase and PI3K signaling (72%); chromatin remodeling, including mutations/SCNAs in
histone modifying genes (89%); and components of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling
complex (64%) (Fig. 4a). To complement those results for well-defined pathways, we
applied network analysis methods to examine other possible interactions between genes and
pathways (Fig. 4b). In particular, we used the TieDIE algorithm to search for causal
regulatory interactions within the PARADIGM network, which connects mutated genes to
active transcriptional hubs31,32. The analysis identified a sub-network linking mutated
histone-modifying genes to a large array of activated transcription factors, suggesting
potential far-reaching effects of histone modification on other pathways (Supplementary Fig.
S8.2.1), converging on MYC/MAX regulation. Both MYC and MAX showed similar levels
of pathway activity, independent of mutations in chromatin genes, suggesting that mutations
in histone-modifying genes provide just one mechanism for disruption of the MYC/MAX
hub. In contrast, tumours with chromatin-related mutations showed differential activity of
transcription factors FOXA2 and SP1, implicating de-differentiation processes as a result of
the mutations. Our network analysis also identified HSP90AA1 as a critical signaling hub,
suggesting that inhibitors of HSP90 may have therapeutic value in urothelial carcinoma.
Although the linkages between mutations and transcriptional changes were statistically
significant in terms of their proximity in the network (as determined by permutation tests;

see Supplementary Fig. S8.2), further studies will be needed to assess the biological
relevance of the findings.

Author Manuscript

Integrated analysis also identified mutations, copy number alterations or RNA expression
changes affecting the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway in 42% of the tumours (Fig.5a).
Included were activating point mutations in PIK3CA (17%; potentially responsive to PI3K
inhibitors), mutation or deletion of TSC1 or TSC2 (9%; potentially responsive to mTOR
inhibitors) and overexpression of AKT3 (10%; potentially responsive to AKT inhibitors).
We also observed mutations, genomic amplifications or gene fusions that affect the
RTK/RAS pathway in 44% of the tumours (Fig. 5b). Included were events that can activate
FGFR3 (17%; potentially responsive to FGFR inhibitors or antibodies), amplification of
EGFR (9%; potentially responsive to EGFR antibodies or inhibitors), mutations of ERBB3
(6%; potentially sensitive to ERBB kinase inhibitors) and mutation or amplification of
ERBB2 (9%; potentially sensitive to ERBB2 kinase inhibitors or antibodies). ERBB3
mutations in bladder cancer have been noted previously4, but statistically significant
mutation of ERBB2 in bladder cancer has not been reported. Both genes are potential
therapeutic targets in other diseases33-35 (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, ERBB2 alterations were
approximately as frequent in this study as in TCGA breast cancers, but with fewer
amplifications and more mutations (Fig. 5d)24.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

This integrated study of 131 invasive urothelial bladder carcinomas provides numerous
novel insights into disease biology and delineates multiple potential opportunities for
therapeutic intervention. Treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer has not advanced
beyond cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy and surgery in the past 30 years36, and
no new drugs for the disease have been approved in that time. Median survival for patients
with recurrent or metastatic bladder cancer remains 14-15 months with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, and there is no widely recognized second-line therapy37. With the exception
of a single case report, there is also no known benefit from treatment with newer, targeted
agents38. Several of the genomic alterations identified in this study, particularly those
involving the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR, CDKN2A/CDK4/CCND1 and RTK/RAS pathways,
as well as ERBB2 (Her-2), ERBB3 and FGFR3, are amenable in principle to therapeutic
targeting. Clinical trials based on patients with relevant druggable genomic alterations are
warranted.

Author Manuscript

FGFR3 mutation is a common feature of low-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial bladder
cancer, but it occurs at a much lower frequency in high-grade invasive bladder cancer. The
cluster analysis in Figure 3 highlights multiple mechanisms of FGFR3 activation, and its
strong association with papillary morphology. The data presented here suggest a subset of
muscle-invasive cancers that can potentially be targeted through FGFR3. Similarly, ERBB2
amplification may be targetable by strategies used in breast cancer, by small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors or by novel immunotherapeutic approaches (NCT01353222)34.
The data here provide further support for several ongoing ERBB2-targeted trials in bladder
cancer and further define the subpopulation of cancers suited to that approach. Finally,
cluster III of the integrated expression profiling analysis reveals the existence of a urothelial

carcinoma subtype with high cancer stem cell content (including KRT14/5), perhaps
providing another avenue for therapeutic targeting.

Author Manuscript

The alterations identified in epigenetic pathways also suggest new possibilities for bladder
cancer treatment. Ninety-nine (76%) of the tumours analyzed here had an inactivating
mutation in one or more of the chromatin regulatory genes, and 53 (41%) had at least two
such mutations. Overall, the bladder cancers showed a mutational spectrum highly enriched
with mutations in chromatin regulatory genes (Supplementary Table S2.10). Further,
integrated network analyses revealed a profound impact of those mutations on the activity
levels of various transcription factors and pathways implicated in cancer. Recent
development of drugs that bind competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs (i.e.,
bromodomains) might prove useful for treatment of the subset of bladder tumours that have
abnormalities in chromatin-modifyingenzymes39. Our findings suggest that bladder cancer is
a prime candidate for further exploration of that approach to therapy.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Tumour and normal samples were obtained with institutional review board-approved
consent and processed using a modified AllPrep kit (Qiagen) to obtain purified DNA and
RNA. Quality-control analyses revealed only modest batch effects (Supplementary Text
S13.1). The tumours were profiled using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays for SCNAs, lowpass WGS (HiSeq) for SCNAs and translocations, RNA-seq (HiSeq) for mRNA and miRNA
expression, Illumina Infinium (HumanMethylation450) arrays for DNA methylation, HiSeq
for exome sequencing and RPPA for protein expression and phosphorylation. Statistical
analysis and biological interpretation of the data were spearheaded by the TCGA Genome

a, Mutation rate and type, histologic subtype, smoking status, gender, tumour stage, and
cluster type. b, Genes with statistically significant levels of mutation (MutSig, FDR < 0.1)
and mutation types. c, Deletions and amplifications for genomic regions with statistically
significant focal copy number changes (GISTIC2.0). CN refers to absolute copy number.
Note that two amplification peaks (*) contain several genes, any of which could be the
target, as opposed to the single gene listed here. d, RNA expression level expressed as fold
change from the median (of all samples). RPKM values are shown for selected genes subject
to mutation and/or focal copy number change. Tumour samples were grouped into three
clusters (red, blue, and green) using consensus NMF clustering (see the main text and
Supplementary Figure 2.1.2). Three samples with no copy number data and two samples
with no mutations in the genes were not used in the clustering and are shown in gray.

Figure 3. Expression characteristics of bladder cancer

Author Manuscript

Integrated analysis of mRNA, miRNA and protein data led to identification of distinct
subsets of urothelial carcinoma. Data for mRNA, miRNA and protein were z-normalized,
and samples were organized in the horizontal direction by mRNA clustering. a, Papillary
histology, FGFR3 alterations, FGFR3 expression and reduced FGFR3-related miRNA
expression are enriched in cluster I. b. Expression of epithelial lineage genes and stem/
progenitor cytokeratins are generally high in cluster III, some of which express variant
squamous histology. c, Luminal breast and urothelial differentiation factors are enriched in
clusters I and II. d, ERBB2 mutation and estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) expression are
enriched in clusters I and II.

Figure 4. Altered pathways and networks in bladder cancer

Author Manuscript

a, Somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) in components of the p53/Rb
pathway, RTK/RAS/PI3K pathway, histone modification system and SWI/SNF complex.
Red, activating genetic alterations; blue, inactivating genetic alterations. Percentages shown
denote activation or inactivation of at least one allele. b, The network connecting mutated
histone-modifying genes to transcription factors with differential activity (methodology and
larger implicated network in Supplementary Fig. 8.2.1). Each gene is depicted as a multiring circle with various levels of data, plotted such that each ‘spoke’ in the ring represents a
single patient sample (same sample ordering for all genes). ‘PARADIGM’ ring:
bioinformatically inferred levels of gene activity (red, higher activity); ‘Transcriptional
Activity’: mean mRNA levels of all of the targets of each transcription factor; ‘Expression’:
mRNA levels relative to normal (red, high); ‘Mutation in gene’: somatic mutation;
‘Mutation in histone modifier genes’: somatic mutation in at least one such gene; ‘IPL anticorrelation’: genes with PARADIGM Integrated Pathway Levels (IPLs) inversely correlated
with histone-gene mutation status. Gene-gene relationships inferred using public resources.

a, Alterations in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway are mutually exclusive. Tumour samples
are shown in columns, genes in rows. Only samples with at least one alteration are shown.
AKT3 shows elevated expression in 10% of samples, independent of copy-number (right
panel). b, Receptor tyrosine kinases are altered, by any of several different mechanisms
(amplification, mutation, and fusion), in 45% of samples. Only mutations that are recurrent
in this data set or previously reported in COSMIC are shown. c, Recurrent mutations in
ERBB2 and ERBB3. The mutations shown in black are either recurrent in the TCGA data
set or are reported in COSMIC. Green: Receptor L domain; red: furin-like cysteine-rich
region; blue: growth factor receptor domain IV; yellow: tyrosine kinase domain. d, ERBB2
amplifications and recurrent mutations in other projects profiled by TCGA. Missense
mutations were counted in the following positions: G309, S310, L313, R678, T733, L755,
V777, D769, V842, T862, R896, M916I. In-frame insertions were counted between amino
acids 774 and 776. Only tumour types with an alteration frequency ≥ 2% are shown.
