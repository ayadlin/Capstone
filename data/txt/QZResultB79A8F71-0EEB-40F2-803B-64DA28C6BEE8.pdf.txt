Abstract
In a previous study, we found that the small-molecule
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib
(ZD1839, Iressa) blocked cell proliferation at biologically
relevant concentrations in approximately one third (6 of 17)
of human bladder cancer cell lines examined. Here, we studied
the effects of gefitinib on apoptosis in a representative subset
of the same panel of cells. The drug had modest effects on DNA
fragmentation as a single agent at concentrations that
produced strong growth inhibition (V1 Mmol/L) and also failed
to promote apoptosis induced by conventional chemotherapeutic agents (gemcitabine and paclitaxel). However, gefitinib
did interact with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to induce high
levels of apoptosis in gefitinib-responsive but not gefitinibunresponsive lines. The molecular mechanisms involved downregulation of active AKT and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (XIAP) expression and were mimicked by chemical
inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway
but not of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK pathway. Furthermore, direct small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of
AKT resulted in down-regulation of XIAP and TRAIL sensitization, and knockdown of XIAP itself was sufficient to reverse
TRAIL resistance. Together, our results show that EGFR
pathway activation limits TRAIL-induced apoptosis via an
AKT- and XIAP-dependent mechanism in EGFR-dependent
human bladder cancer cells, providing the conceptual framework for a further evaluation of the combination in relevant
preclinical in vivo models. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1430–5]

Introduction
Gefitinib (also known as ZD1839 or Iressa) is an orally active,
selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
antagonist that inhibits tumor cell growth at nanomolar concentrations in responsive cell lines in vitro (1, 2). Although it displayed
promising activity in preclinical models (2), it produced disappointing results in large-scale clinical trials involving more than
60,000 patients: response rates in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) hovered f10% and response rates in other types of

cancer were equivalent (3–5). Approximately 10% of NSCLC
tumors from patients in the United States contain mutant EGFRs
that may render the cells that express them ‘‘addicted’’ to EGFRmediated signaling for cell survival (6, 7), but these mutations do
not seem to accumulate to any significant degree in other solid
malignancies (8, 9). On the other hand, the EGFR regulates
downstream signal transduction pathways [i.e., extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and AKT activation] that could limit
apoptosis induced by conventional or investigational cytotoxic
agents, and it is likely that the effects of EGFR inhibitors on these
pathways can be exploited in EGFR-dependent tumors in
combination regimens (2). Therefore, we designed the present
study to directly test the effects of EGFR inhibition on cell death
induced by clinically relevant cytotoxic agents that are either
currently being evaluated or could be evaluated in EGFR inhibitorbased clinical trials in patients with bladder cancer. Our data
reveal that gefitinib is a particularly effective tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-sensitizing agent
in EGFR-dependent cells via its ability to inhibit AKT activation
and down-regulate X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)
expression.

Quantification of DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation was
measured by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis (Beckman Coulter, Mountain View, CA) as
described previously (8).
Immunoblot analysis for p27 and XIAP. Total cell lysates were
prepared using a 1% Triton X-100 buffer as described previously (8).
Expression of p27 and XIAP was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting (11).
Two-color analyses of intracellular p27 expression and DNA
fragmentation. Two-color intracellular staining for p27 and DNA
fragmentation was done as described previously (12). p27 was detected
using an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR).
siRNA-mediated silencing of p27, XIAP, or AKT. Cells were transiently
transfected with specific or nonspecific siRNA constructs for
48 h according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The constructs were all
used at 200 nmol/L. Liposome-mediated transfection was accomplished
with the siIMPORTER reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The efficiency of silencing was verified in each experiment by
immunoblotting.

Results and Discussion
Effects of gefitinib on apoptosis. To assess the direct effects of
gefitinib on apoptosis, we incubated four gefitinib-sensitive (253J
B-V, UM-UM-4, UM-UC-5, and UM-UC-10) and three gefitinibinsensitive (KU7, UM-UC-2, and UM-UC-14) cell lines (13) with 1 or
10 Amol/L of gefitinib and measured DNA fragmentation 48 h later
by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. Gefitinib induced
concentration-dependent increases in all of the EGFR-dependent
cells, whereas it had no effects in the EGFR-insensitive cells
(Fig. 1A). We also characterized the effects of gefitinib on apoptosis
induced by paclitaxel or gemcitabine in representative gefitinibsensitive (253J B-V) and gefitinib-resistant (UM-UC-3) cells using
concentrations of gemcitabine or paclitaxel that were found to be
optimal in preliminary studies (data not shown). Gefitinib had no
effect on gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in either of the cell lines,
and it actually antagonized the proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel in
the gefitinib-sensitive cells in a schedule-dependent manner (i.e.,
when cells were preincubated for 24 h with gefitinib before they
were exposed to paclitaxel; Fig. 1B).
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) sensitizes
bladder cancer cells to TRAIL via a mechanism that involves
p21-dependent inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2
activity (14). Gefitinib also arrests EGFR-dependent cells in G1 via
mechanisms that involve p27-dependent down-regulation of cdk2
activity (8). Therefore, we speculated that gefitinib might
promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human bladder cancer
cells via p27-dependent G1 arrest. To test this hypothesis, we
exposed three gefitinib-sensitive (253J B-V, UM-UC-5, and
UM-UC-10) and three gefitinib-insensitive (KU7, UM-UC-3, and
UM-UC-14) cells to 1 Amol/L gefitinib in the presence or absence
of 25 ng/mL recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and measured
DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide/FACS 24 h later.
Gefitinib promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis in all three gefitinibsensitive lines but had no effect on the gefitinib-insensitive cells
(Fig. 1C).
Roles of the ERKs and AKT in TRAIL sensitization. Gefitinib
down-regulates constitutive phosphorylation of the ERKs and
AKT in EGFR-dependent bladder cancer cells but has no effect on
ERK or AKT activation in the resistant cells (13, 15). To determine
whether inhibition of one or both pathways was required to
promote TRAIL sensitivity, we incubated 253J B-V cells with

www.aacrjournals.org

optimal concentrations of small-molecule inhibitors of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway (wortmannin),
the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway (U0126), or both in
the presence or absence of rhTRAIL and measured apoptosis
24 h later by propidium iodide/FACS. Neither compound nor other
structurally distinct inhibitors of the pathways (PD98059 and
LY294002; data not shown) induced much DNA fragmentation at
this time point at concentrations that completely blocked
constitutive and EGF-induced ERK and AKT phosphorylation
(Fig. 2A; data not shown). However, like gefitinib, wortmannin
interacted synergistically with TRAIL to induce high levels of
apoptosis, whereas U0126 had minimal effects on cell death
(Fig. 2A). Exposure to the combination of wortmannin plus U0126
produced the same degree of TRAIL sensitization as wortmannin
alone, confirming that ERK inhibition played a minor role in TRAIL
sensitization in these cells (Fig. 2A). Wortmannin promoted
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in all of the cell lines we examined
(n = 7), including two of the cell lines that were unresponsive to
gefitinib (UM-UC-3 and KU7; data not shown).
As we previously implicated, cdk2 inhibition in the TRAIL
sensitization observed in cells exposed to the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib (14), we investigated whether p27 accumulation might play a similar role in 253J B-V cells exposed to
gefitinib. Gefitinib or U0126, but not wortmannin, induced
significant accumulation of p27 protein (Fig. 2B), strongly
suggesting that p27 accumulation was driven via ERK pathway
inhibition. Bortezomib also increased p27 expression presumably
by preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein
(Fig. 2B). Exposure to TRAIL actually reduced p27 expression,
effects that were most pronounced in cells exposed to TRAIL plus
either gefitinib or wortmannin and were displaying the most cell
death (Fig. 2B). Moreover, simultaneous analysis of p27 expression
and apoptosis by two-color flow cytometry showed that the
subdiploid (apoptotic) cells exhibited low levels of p27 fluorescence, whereas viable cells displayed high levels of p27
fluorescence (Fig. 2C). Finally, direct knockdown of p27 by RNA
interference (RNAi) had little effect on gefitinib plus TRAIL–
induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). Thus, in 253J B-V cells, TRAIL
sensitivity seems to be driven primarily via inhibition of the PI3K/
AKT pathway, whereas p27 accumulation is driven primarily via
inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway.
Effects of AKT inhibition on XIAP expression. The caspase-3/
caspase-7/caspase-9 antagonist XIAP inhibits TRAIL-induced
apoptosis and is a very attractive therapeutic target (16). XIAP
expression may be regulated via AKT-dependent mechanism(s)
(17, 18). Therefore, we characterized the effects of gefitinib,
wortmannin, and U0126 on XIAP expression in 253J B-V cells.
Gefitinib and wortmannin, but not U0126, inhibited XIAP protein
expression in the cells (Fig. 3A). These effects were not associated
with changes in XIAP mRNA levels as measured by RNase
protection assay (data not shown), strongly suggesting that
down-regulation occurred at the translational or post-translational
level (17, 18). RNAi-mediated knockdown of XIAP expression did
not directly induce much cell death (Fig. 3B). However, silencing
XIAP produced marked TRAIL sensitization (Fig. 3B), confirming
that XIAP promoted TRAIL resistance in the cells.
Finally, to more directly determine whether AKT was the target
of gefitinib action, we transduced 253J B-V cells with an adenoviral
construct encoding a constitutively active (myristoylated) form of
AKT or a control construct and measured their effects on
gefitinib-mediated TRAIL sensitization. DNA fragmentation levels

were inhibited by at least 50% in the AKT-transduced cells relative
to controls (data not shown). To determine whether the effects
of gefitinib on AKT accounted for the down-regulation of XIAP
observed, we transfected 253J B-V cells with an AKT-specific
siRNA construct or an off-target control and measured XIAP
expression and TRAIL-induced DNA fragmentation. AKT1 was the
predominant AKT isoform expressed by the 253J B-V cells (data
not shown). Silencing AKT1 resulted in marked down-regulation
of XIAP (Fig. 3C) and increased TRAIL sensitivity in the 253J B-V
cells to levels that were equivalent to those observed in cells
exposed to gefitinib or wortmannin (Fig. 3D). Together, these

results establish that AKT inhibition is required for gefitinibinduced TRAIL sensitization and that the effects of AKT inhibition
involve down-regulation of XIAP in the 253J B-V cells.
Previous preclinical studies and clinical trials have investigated
the tumor growth-inhibitory effects of combinations of EGFR
antagonists and conventional chemotherapy (particularly taxanes;
refs. 2, 19). Whereas the preclinical studies consistently showed
that combination therapy was more effective than therapy with
either EGFR antagonists or conventional agents alone, the clinical
trials failed to show that combination therapy provided benefit
beyond what was observed with the conventional agents alone (19).

Problems with patient selection undoubtedly plagued these studies
(just as they did earlier single-agent trials) because gefitinibresponsive tumors were not identified prospectively. Nonetheless,
our results and data from other groups show that gefitinib does not
always enhance chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and in some
cases, it actually seems to interfere with apoptosis in gefitinibsensitive cells (20, 21). In retrospect, this is not surprising given that
gefitinib induces cell cycle arrest in responsive cells, and this
G1 arrest would not be expected to promote the cytotoxic effects
of agents that seem to act preferentially within S or M phase (12).
On the other hand, the combination of gefitinib plus rhTRAIL
produces strong additive effects in EGFR-dependent, TRAILsensitive cells and synergistic effects in EGFR-dependent, TRAILinsensitive cells. We are currently evaluating the effects of
combination therapy with TRAIL plus gefitinib in orthotopic
EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent tumors to determine
whether these promising effects can be reproduced without toxicity
in vivo. Preliminary toxicity studies have shown that systemic
combination therapy with gefitinib (100 mg/kg) plus rhTRAIL
(10 mg/kg) is very well tolerated.4

www.aacrjournals.org

Although our previous work with bortezomib strongly suggested
that tumor cells arrested in G1 might be sensitized to TRAIL via
accumulation of the cdk inhibitor p21 (14), in the current study,
we were able to completely distinguish the effects of gefitinib on
TRAIL sensitization from the effects of the drug on p27. Indeed,
cells exposed to TRAIL plus gefitinib expressed lower levels of p27
than did cells exposed to gefitinib alone, and two-color FACS
revealed that p27 expression was restricted to viable cells. It is
likely that the effects of AKT inhibition on the TRAIL pathway are
complex and involve more than XIAP down-regulation. Indeed,
inhibitors of the AKT target glycogen synthase kinase-3h (15)
promote further increases in TRAIL sensitivity in cells exposed to
gefitinib.
One major disadvantage associated with using EGFR antagonists
as TRAIL-sensitizing agents in bladder cancer is that tumor cell
EGFR dependency must be established to ensure optimal
therapeutic outcome. In recent work, we showed that expression

of two markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (E-cadherin
and vimentin) loosely correlates with gefitinib sensitivity and
resistance, respectively, but this correlation is not perfect (13).5
Thus, one would expect that agents that target TRAIL resistance
mechanisms downstream of the EGFR would display broader
activity that may preclude the need to define EGFR dependency
prospectively. Consistent with this notion, we have observed that
