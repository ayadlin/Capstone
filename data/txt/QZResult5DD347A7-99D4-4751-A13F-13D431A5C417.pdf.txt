Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway plays a central role in regulating tumor cell
growth, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. The key
components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal module are
frequently altered in human cancers. Targeting this pathway
represents a promising anticancer strategy. Small molecule
inhibitors targeting MEK1/2 have shown promise in the clinic;
however, ultimate clinical proof-of-concept remains elusive.
Here, we report a potent and highly selective non–ATPcompetitive MEK1/2 inhibitor, RO4927350, with a novel
chemical structure and unique mechanism of action. It
selectively blocks the MAPK pathway signaling both in vitro
and in vivo, which results in significant antitumor efficacy in a
broad spectrum of tumor models. Compared with previously
reported MEK inhibitors, RO4927350 inhibits not only ERK1/2
but also MEK1/2 phosphorylation. In cancer cells, high basal
levels of phospho-MEK1/2 rather than phospho-ERK1/2
seem to correlate with greater sensitivity to RO4927350.
Furthermore, RO4927350 prevents a feedback increase
in MEK phosphorylation, which has been observed with
other MEK inhibitors. We show that B-Raf rather than
C-Raf plays a critical role in the feedback regulation. The
unique MAPK signaling blockade mediated by RO4927350 in
cancer may reduce the risk of developing drug resistance.
Thus, RO4927350 represents a novel therapeutic modality in
cancers with aberrant MAPK pathway activation. [Cancer Res
2009;69(5):1924–32]

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway represents one of the best characterized signaling pathways involved in
the development and progression of human cancers. This pathway,
via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal cascade, is responsible for
transmitting and amplifying mitogenic signals from the cell surface
to the nucleus where activated transcription factors regulate gene
expression and determine cell fate. The constitutive activation of

this pathway is sufficient to induce cellular transformation.
Deregulation of the MAPK pathway, due to aberrant receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation and Ras and/or B-Raf mutations,
is frequently found in human cancers and represents a major factor
in determining abnormal cell growth (1). Ras oncogenic mutations
occur in f30% of all human cancers with the highest incidences in
adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90%), colon (45%), and lung
(35%; ref. 2). Oncogenic mutations in B-Raf have been found in 66%
of primary melanomas and less frequently in other tumors such as
colon (12%), ovarian (30%), and papillary thyroid cancers (35–70%;
refs. 3–5). Furthermore, aberrant activation of the MAPK pathway
correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients
with various cancers such as breast, colorectal, prostate, renal cell
carcinoma, non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and melanoma.
Thus, key players of the MAPK pathway are attractive targets for
the development of cancer therapeutic agents (1, 6, 7).
MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2) are members of a large family of
dual-specificity kinases (MEK1-7) that phosphorylate threonine
and tyrosine residues of various MAPKs. Thus far, the only known
substrates of MEK1/2 are ERK1/2. Although MEK1/2 mutations
have not been found in human cancers, the constitutive expression
of MEK1/2 is sufficient to induce transformation (8, 9). Targeting
MEK1/2 with a small molecule inhibitor has the potential to
prevent all upstream aberrant oncogenic signaling (RTK, Ras, and
B-Raf). In the clinic, highly selective MEK inhibitors with related
core chemical structures, namely PD0325901 (Pfizer; ref. 10),
ARRY142886/AZD6244 (Array Biopharma/AstraZeneca; ref. 11),
and XL518 (Exelixis/Genentech) have been evaluated for clinical
proof-of-concept (POC) in phase I/II trials. PD0325901 and
ARRY142886/AZD6244 have shown partial responses and stable
diseases in some patients with pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, and
malignant melanoma; however, ultimate clinical POC for these
MEK inhibitors has yet to be shown.
In the current study, we report that RO4927350 is a highly
selective and potent MEK inhibitor with novel structure and
mechanism of action in cancer cells. RO4927350 exhibits significant
antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo by selectively blocking the
MAPK pathway signaling via a unique tandem inhibition of the
phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2. This unique mode of
MAPK signal blockade may provide additional clinical benefit to
ensure sufficient and durable pathway inhibition.

reaction was stopped by the addition of Eu/APC in the presence of
20 mmol/L EDTA for an additional 1 h incubation at room temperature.
Plates were read on an Envision reader. Compound IC50 values were
determined from interplate triplicate sets of data.
Biacore binding assay. GST cleaved human recombinant MEK was
minimally biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in a reagent to
protein ratio of 0.3:1. Free biotin was removed with exhaustive dialysis
after 20-h incubation at 4jC. Kinetic binding studies were performed on
Biacore S51. Biotinylated MEK was captured on a Biacore streptavidin
sensor chip (Series S Sensor Chip SA) at a density of 5758 resonance units
(ru). One ru corresponds to f1 pg of protein/mm2. Test compound was
dissolved in 100% DMSO at 10 mmol/L and diluted in a 2-fold

www.aacrjournals.org

Bethesda Research Laboratories). The LOX IMVI cells were provided by the
Biological Testing Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division
of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI-Frederick.
Western blot analysis. Cells were seeded at appropriate density
(70–75% confluent) in 6-well plates 1 d before compound treatment. Upon
compound treatment at various concentrations, the cells were harvested
and lysed immediately with 1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology).
Where indicated, cells were serum-starved for 16 h, treated with
compounds for 1 h, and stimulated with 500 nmol/L phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37jC. Tumor tissues were
harvested at the indicated time points and stored at 80jC. Protein was
extracted by homogenization (Autogizer; TOMTEC) in the presence of
1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing protease
inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the
lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to clear insoluble
fragments. Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on 4% to 12%
NuPAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) and blotted with antibodies as indicated.
The chemiluminescent signal was generated with enhanced chemiluminescence Plus and detected with Fujifilm LAS-3000 imager. The densitometric
quantitation of specific bands was determined using Multi Gauge Software
(Fujifilm).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assays. The cells were seeded 1 d before compound treatment and exposed
to compounds for 5 d. Cell respiration, as an indicator of cell viability, was
measured by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan. The conversion of MTT into
formazan by viable cells was assessed by a microplate reader at 570 nm.
Cell cycle analysis. Subconfluent cells were treated with compound for
24 h, harvested, and then rinsed with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol at
20jC. Cells were stained in a PI/RNase staining buffer (BD Biosciences)
at room temperature for 15 min and analyzed for DNA content by flow
cytometry. Cell cycle distribution and histograms were generated with
FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) software.
siRNA transfection. HT-29 and DU 145 cells were transfected with
50 nmol/L nontargeting (NT), B-Raf, or C-Raf siRNAs (Dharmacon
siGenome Smartpool) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen). After
48 h, cells were treated with DMSO, RO4927350 (10 Amol/L), or U0126
(10 Amol/L) for 1 h and harvested. Cell lysates were resolved on 4% to
12% NuPAGE gradient gels (Invitrogen) and blotted with antibodies as
indicated.
In vivo xenograft tumor models. Human cancer cells were implanted
s.c. in the right flank of female nude mice (Charles River Laboratories). Once
the xenograft tumors reached a mean tumor volume of f100 to 200 mm3,
mice were randomized to treatment groups (n = 10 per group) and received
either vehicle or compound at the dose indicated. Tumor volume and
mouse body weight were measured twice to thrice weekly. Efficacy data
were graphically represented as the mean tumor volume F SE. Tumor
volume (in cubic millimeters) was calculated using the ellipsoid formula:
[D  (d 2)]/2 where D represents the large diameter of the tumor, and
d represents the small diameter. Tumor volumes of treated groups were
presented as percentages of tumor volumes of the control groups (%T/C),
using the formula: 100  [(T T 0) / (C C 0)], where T represented mean
tumor volume of a treated group on a specific day during the experiment,
T 0 represented mean tumor volume of the same treated group on the first
day of treatment; C represented mean tumor volume of a control group on
the specific day during the experiment, and C 0 represented mean tumor
volume of the same treated group on the first day of treatment. Percent
tumor growth inhibition was calculated using the formula 100 %T/C.
Statistical analysis was determined by the rank sum test (SigmaStat, version
2.0; Jandel Scientific). Differences between groups were considered to be
significant when the P value was V0.05.
In vivo evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effect of RO4927350
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cynomolgus monkey.
RO4927350 was orally administered to cynomolgus monkey at 50 mg/kg
and whole blood was collected predose and at 2, 12, or 24 h postdose.
The blood samples were treated with PMA (400 nmol/L) for 5 min at
37jC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using

Western blot and quantified by Fuji imaging system.

Results
RO4927350 is a highly selective and potent novel MEK
inhibitor in vitro. Using a Raf/MEK/ERK cascade assay in highthroughput screening, we identified a new class of potent MEK1/2
inhibitors that contain a substituted hydantoin ring. RO4927350 is
a representative of this class. Biacore analysis showed its direct
binding to unphosphorylated MEK with high binding affinity as
evidenced by its fast rate of association and its slow rate of
dissociation (Fig. 1A). RO4927350 potently inhibited MEK1 kinase
activity with an IC50 value of 23 nmol/L in a Raf/MEK/ERK cascade
assay (Fig. 1B) and showed consistent MEK inhibition in the range
of 2 to 250 Amol/L concentrations of ATP (Fig. 1C), which suggests
that RO4927350 is a non–ATP-competitive inhibitor. Its high
specificity against MEK was determined in various assays (Table 1).
RO4927350 was active in C-Raf/MEK/ERK and MEK/ERK assays
with a Ki of 0.053 and 0.184 Amol/L, respectively, but inactive
against C-Raf (Ki >50 Amol/L) when the compound was tested in
the Caliper C-Raf assay using a peptide as substrate (GQLIDSMANSFVGTR-NH2). The selectivity of RO4927350 was further
shown in both internal (a panel of diverse kinases; Table 1) and
external kinase assay panel (Ambit profiling of 227 kinases).
RO4927350 at 10 Amol/L was inactive against all other kinases
including C-Raf (Raf1) and B-Raf in Ambit profiling (data not
shown). Thus, RO4927350 is a novel potent and selective MEK1/2
inhibitor.
RO4927350 selectively inhibits both ERK and MEK phosphorylation and affects cell proliferation in cancer cells. As
ERK1/2 are the only known substrates of MEK1/2, ERK1/2
phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) levels were used to determine the
degree of MEK1/2 inhibition in human HT-29 colorectal and LOX
melanoma cells. Both cell lines harbor B-Raf V600E mutations and
have high basal levels of ERK and MEK phosphorylation.

B, RO4927350 selectively inhibits the phosphorylation of both ERK and MEK, but not AKT and p38, in HT-29 colorectal and LOX melanoma cancer cells. Cells were

Western blot bands.

RO4927350 significantly and dose-dependently suppressed basal
levels of ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK; Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
RO4927350 also significantly and dose-dependently inhibited basal
levels of MEK phosphorylation (p-MEK; Fig. 2B). RO4927350
selectively inhibited Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activity in cells while
having no effect on the activation status of other closely related
intracellular signaling molecules such as p38 and AKT (Fig. 2B).

the subsequent cellular consequences of p-ERK suppression, the
antiproliferative effect of RO4927350 was examined by MTT assay.

values between 0.29 and 5.2 Amol/L. As previously reported with
other MEK inhibitors, tumor cell lines containing the B-Raf V600E
mutation were highly sensitive to RO4927350 treatment (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 13). In addition, the results in Supplementary
Table S1 indicate that p-ERK suppression alone is not sufficient to
predict the antiproliferative activity of MEK inhibitor RO4927350
in cancer cells. To identify additional factors determining the
sensitivity of cancer cell lines responding to RO4927350, we profiled
both basal p-ERK and p-MEK levels by Western blot (Fig. 2C). B-Raf
mutant tumor cell lines were found to have relatively high baseline
levels of p-MEK1/2. In B-Raf wild-type (WT) lines, especially in cells
with WT Ras and B-Raf, high basal levels of p-MEK, but not p-ERK,
seemed to be another predictive factor for tumor cell responsiveness to RO4927350 treatment (such as in BxPC-3 and 22Rv1;
Fig. 2C). Comparison of the IC50 values in a paired normal fibroblast
Malme-3 (>30 Amol/L) versus malignant melanoma Malme-3M
(0.15 Amol/L) cell lines showed that the melanoma tumor cell with
B-RafV600E was more susceptible to RO4927350 treatment than
its normal counterpart. These results suggest that MEK inhibitor
RO4927350 is highly active in cancer cells with aberrant MAPK
pathway signaling, which is likely reflected by the phosphorylation
levels of MEK1/2 rather than ERK1/2.
Mechanism of action of MEK inhibitor RO4927350 in cancer
cells. To understand the underlying mechanism of action of
RO4927350 in affecting cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed its

effect on the cell cycle in tumor cells that were either sensitive or
resistant to drug treatment. In responsive HT-29 colorectal cancer
cells, specific inhibition of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
by RO4927350 (Fig. 2B) led to G1 phase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3A).
Correspondingly, treatment with RO4927350 resulted in the downregulation of CDK4, cyclin D1, and the up-regulation of p21 and
p27 (Fig. 3B), key cell cycle regulators for G1-S phase progression.
In contrast, in resistant DU 145 prostate cancer cells, RO4927350
potently suppressed ERK1/2 phoshphorylation with an IC50 of
0.270 Amol/L (Supplementary Table S1) leading to the upregulation of p21 and p27 but minimal down-regulation of CDK4
and cyclin D1 (Fig. 3B) and negligible G1 phase of cell cycle arrest
(Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in other sensitive and
resistant cancer cells (LOX melanoma and MCF7 breast cancer
cells; Fig. 3C). Furthermore, RO4927350 was shown to downregulate cell cycle regulators c-Myc and Mcl-1, ultimately inducing
apoptotic cell death as evident by PARP cleavage in sensitive LOX
but not resistant MCF7 cells.
A novel mechanism of action of RO4927350 that differentiates it from other MEK inhibitors. The dual inhibition of
MEK and ERK phosphorylation is thus far unique to RO4927350
and its analogues, clearly differentiated this class of molecules from
other MEK inhibitors that inhibit ERK but not MEK phosphorylation (14, 15). Previous studies have shown a negative feedback
mechanism exists in cells that precisely controls hyperactive p-ERK

Figure 3. Mechanism of actions of MEK inhibitor RO4927350 in cancer cells. A, RO4927350 induces G1 cell cycle arrest only in responsive cancer cells. HT-29
and DU 145 cancer cells were treated with DMSO or RO4927350 (5 Amol/L) for 24 h and cell cycle profiles were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis. The values for cell cycle distribution were derived using FlowJo software. B, RO4927350 affects the expressions of genes that are critical to G1-S phase
transition in cell cycle. HT-29 and DU 145 cells were treated with RO4927350 for 16 or 24 h, and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies as
indicated. C, RO4927350 induces G1 cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death only in responsive cancer cells. Western blot analysis of cell lysates
from LOX or MCF7 cells with or without RO4927350 treatment.

Figure 4. A novel differential mechanism of action of RO4927350. A, HT-29 and DU 145 cells were treated with MEK inhibitor RO4927350 or U0126 or ERK
inhibitor FR180204 for 1 h, and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies as indicated. B, HT-29 and DU 145 cells were serum starved
overnight and treated with various compounds (at 10 Amol/L) for 1 h, then stimulated with PMA for 5 min, and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using
antibodies as indicated. C, siRNA knockdown studies to decipher the feedback mechanism. HT-29 and DU 145 cells were transfected with nontargeting (NT), B-Raf,
or C-Raf siRNAs. After 48 h, cells were treated with DMSO, RO4927350 (10 Amol/L), or U0126 (10 Amol/L) for 1 h and harvested. Cell lysates were analyzed by
Western blot using various antibodies as indicated.

signaling via direct regulation of Raf-1 (C-Raf). Raf-1 activity is
sustained in cells treated with U0126, a non-ATP competitive MEK
inhibitor (16). Because treatment with RO4927350 results in
decreased ERK and MEK phosphorylation in cancer cells
(Fig. 2B), it was interesting to examine whether RO4927350 differs
from U0126 in this regard. As the results in Fig. 4A show, basal
levels of p-MEK are high in HT-29 (B-RafV600E) cells and low in DU
145 (WT Ras/B-Raf) cells. RO4927350 significantly suppressed the
basal phosphorylation levels of MEK and ERK in both cell lines,
whereas U0126 only weakly inhibited MEK phosphorylation in
HT-29 cells and resulted in a dose-dependent feedback increase in
p-MEK levels in DU 145 cells. ERK inhibitor (FR180204), as a
control, had minimal effect on MEK or ERK phosphorylation. It is
worth noting that other MEK inhibitors (PD0325901, AZD6244)
currently in clinical development have shown a similar induction of
feedback increase in p-MEK levels in WT B-Raf cells (14, 15).
We next compared the effects of RO4927350 and U0126 on
mitogen-stimulated MAPK pathway activation in HT-29 and DU

145 cells. When cells were stimulated with PMA (Fig. 4B), the
MAPK pathway signaling components were highly activated as
shown by the elevated levels of p-MEK, p-ERK, p-RSK, p-ELK, and
p-MNK compared with untreated controls (Fig. 4B). RO4927350
suppressed PMA-induced activation of MAPK pathway components including MEK in both cell lines. U0126 only suppressed
components of the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK. As
expected, ERK inhibitor (FR180204) only inhibited protein
activation downstream of ERK in both cell lines.
Previous studies have suggested that Raf-1 (C-Raf) might be the
target of negative feedback inhibition after ERK hyperactivation
(16). We specifically knocked down B-Raf or C-Raf in HT-29 and DU
145 cells to determine whether the depletion of either Raf could
influence U0126-induced feedback activation of MEK. When cells
were transfected with control or Raf siRNAs, a significant depletion
of B-Raf or C-Raf by the respective siRNAs was shown in the HT-29
and DU 145 cells (Fig. 4C, two top panels). The basal levels of p-MEK
and p-ERK were reduced by B-Raf but not C-Raf knockdown

(DMSO controls: Fig. 4C, lanes 1–3 and 10–12). The B-Raf
knockdown resulted in a decrease in basal p-MEK and p-ERK
levels in both cell lines regardless of B-Raf mutational status
(lanes 2 and 11), although the effect on p-ERK was higher in the BRafV600E mutant line (HT-29), which is consistent with the current
understanding that oncogenic B-RafV600E mutation predominantly drives aberrant MAPK pathway activation in tumor cells bearing
this mutation. Knockdown of C-Raf (lanes 3 and 12); however,
either had no effect (in HT-29 cells) or led to an increase in basal
level of p-MEK (in DU 145). When siRNA-transfected HT-29 cells
were treated with RO4927350, significant suppression of both MEK
and ERK phosphorylation was observed regardless of Raf
knockdown (lanes 4–6). U0126, on the other hand, induced modest
inhibition of MEK phosphorylation, which was further enhanced by
the knockdown of B-Raf but not C-Raf (lanes 7–9). When siRNAtransfected DU 145 cells were treated with RO4927350, ERK
phosphorylation was significantly suppressed with no feedback
activation of MEK (lanes 13–15). U0126 induced a feedback
increase in MEK phosphorylation (lane 16) similar to the cells
depleted of C-Raf (lane 12), and this effect was partially relieved by
B-Raf (lane 17) but not C-Raf knockdown (lane 18). These data
suggest that MEK phosphorylation levels in tumor cells are mainly
driven by B-Raf rather than C-Raf activity. The differential
mechanism of inhibition of MEK phosphorylation by RO4927350
in tumor cells prevents a feedback increase of MEK that is observed
with other MEK inhibitors. The novel mode of action of RO4927350
has a similar effect as siRNA-mediated B-Raf depletion in tumor
cells. U0126, on the other hand, seems to mimic the effects
observed in tumor cells after siRNA-mediated C-Raf depletion.
RO4927350 exhibits significant in vivo antitumor efficacy
that correlates with its inhibition of MAPK signaling. The
antitumor activity of RO4927350 was investigated in the LOX
human melanoma xenograft model in nude mice. LOX melanoma
cells contain the most common activating B-Raf mutation (V600E).
When RO4927350 was administered orally to LOX tumor–bearing
mice twice daily with doses from 12.5 to 200 mg/kg for 11 days,
dose-dependent antitumor activity was observed, with partial or
complete tumor regressions elicited at doses above 50 mg/kg
(Fig. 5A). In the same LOX tumor model, after a single oral dose of
100 mg/kg RO4927350, tumors were excised at various time points
postdosing and tumor lysates were analyzed for phospho-ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2), phospho-MEK1/2 (p-MEK1/2), and total ERK and MEK
levels. Significant p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK1/2 inhibition in tumors
was observed up to 8 hours postdosing from mice treated with the
compound compared with the untreated (UT) or vehicle-treated
controls (Fig. 5B). Plasma samples were collected from the same
animals and the drug concentration in plasma was measured.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects correlated well with drug levels in
plasma (Fig. 5B). These results show that the antitumor activity
of RO4927350 correlated well with specific MAPK pathway/target
suppression in vivo.
Investigation of the breadth of in vivo antitumor activity of
RO4927350 in multiple xenograft tumor models revealed antitumor activity that correlated well with in vitro studies.
RO4927350 was orally administered twice daily at doses of 50,
100, or 200 mg/kg in tumor bearing mice for 3 to 4 weeks, and
produced statistically significant and dose-dependent tumor
growth inhibition in a variety of human tumor xenograft models
including HT-29 colorectal, MDA-MB-435 breast, MIA PaCa-2
pancreas, and Calu-6 NSCLC (Supplementary Table S2). Partial
tumor regressions were observed in HT-29, MIA PaCa-2 and

each dosing group. B, nude mice bearing LOX xenograft tumors were treated
with RO4927350 at 100 mg/kg, and the xenograft tumors were harvested at
various time points postdose. The p-ERK/ERK and p-MEK/MEK levels in the
tumor lysates were examined by Western blot analysis. The tumor lysates were
derived from three mice for each time point. Percentage of p-ERK inhibition in
the LOX xenograft tumors was determined and plotted against the respective
drug concentrations in plasma derived from the same animal. The PK-PD

collected at various time points: predose, 2, 12, and 24 hours
postdose. The PD effects in PBMCs were examined by measuring
PMA-stimulated p-ERK levels using Western blot analysis. The
results in Fig. 6 show that RO4927350 significantly suppressed the
PMA-stimulated p-ERK increase after a single oral dose.

Discussion
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been extensively studied in
cancer biology and its relevance for tumorigenesis has been wellestablished. Despite many efforts to identify a cancer therapeutic
agent specifically targeting this pathway (e.g., Ras, Raf, or MEK
inhibitors), none has yet been approved with the exception of the
multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib, which inhibits Raf, but exhibits
antitumor efficacy mainly via its antiangiogenesis activity against
other targets such as KDR, Flt-3, etc. (17, 18). Thus, ultimate clinical
POC with a selective Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor for
cancer therapy remains elusive. Recently, several MEK inhibitors
have entered phase I/II clinical evaluation including PD0325901,
AZD6244/Array-142886, and XL518 (10, 11). These MEK inhibitors
all share common core structures and biological properties (19, 20).
Here, we report a novel MEK inhibitor, RO4927350, which
represents a new chemical class of MEK inhibitors and possesses
a unique mechanism of potent and selective MAPK pathway
blockade in vitro and in vivo. RO4927350 exhibits significant in vivo
antitumor activity in multiple xenograft tumor models including
human melanoma, colorectal, breast, pancreas, and NSCLC. The
tandem inhibition of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 phosphorylation by
RO4927350 is unique compared with other MEK inhibitors such as
PD0325901, AZD6244, and U0126, which only inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Because RO4927350 is a highly selective
MEK inhibitor lacking activity against a panel of diverse kinases
including C-Raf and B-Raf in the Ambit kinase profiling, and
furthermore, it is inactive against C-Raf enzyme in a cell-free

enzyme assay when using a peptide but not MEK protein as the
substrate (Table 1), its inhibitory effect on cellular MEK
phosphorylation suggests that RO4927350 may lock MEK1/2 in
an inactive state and prevent their phosphorylation. This novel
mechanism of action may allow RO4927350 to prevent a feedback
increase in p-MEK that has been observed in tumor cells treated
with other MEK inhibitors (PD0325901, AZD6244, and U0126;
refs. 14, 15). Similar feedback activation has been observed in
tumor cells treated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitors that induce a feedback activation of p-AKT. This
feedback regulation has been suggested as a potential mechanism
for resistance against mTOR inhibitor therapy (21, 22). Thus, the
mechanistic differentiation of RO4927350 may provide additional
clinical benefit such as a reduced risk of developing drug resistance
compared with existing MEK inhibitors. Although ERK1/2 are the
only known substrates of MEK1/2, we can not exclude the
possibility that MEK1/2 may have other unidentified substrates
that are also relevant for tumor cell growth/survival. MEK1 /
fibroblasts were defective in fibronectin-mediated cell migration,
despite the fact that ERK1/2 activation was normal, indicating that
MEK1 might have additional roles other than activation of ERK
(23). RO4927350 might provide ERK-independent, but MEK1/2dependent, antitumor activity. Moreover, the novel structure of
RO4927350 has the potential to avoid chemotype-related liabilities
compared with other MEK inhibitors with a similar core structure.
Similar to other MEK inhibitors, mechanistic studies suggest that
RO4927350 regulates the downstream gene expression of Cyclin D1,
CDK4, p21, and p27 and induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest in a
subset of tumor cells. B-RafV600E mutant cells are particularly
sensitive to RO4927350 treatment. Moreover, we show that
RO4927350 exhibits differential antiproliferative effects in tumor
cells that correlates with the difference in regulation of downstream gene expression in these cells. Only in responsive cells,
RO4927350 regulates the gene expression of key apoptotic
regulators c-Myc and Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis. High basal
levels of MEK rather than ERK phosphorylation in tumor cells
seem to correlate with better responsiveness to RO4927350,
especially in tumor cells carrying WT Ras/B-Raf genes. Interestingly, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of B-Raf or C-Raf, we
identified a close correlation of p-MEK1/2 levels with B-Raf but not
C-Raf activity because the p-MEK levels can be reduced by
depletion of B-Raf but not C-Raf in cells (Fig. 4C). The inhibition of
p-MEK levels was observed in cells treated with either RO4927350
or B-Raf siRNA, but not with other MEK inhibitors, which suggests
that RO4927350 might exhibit antitumor effects in a similar
manner as B-Raf knockdown in tumor cells. U0126 seems more
closely related to C-Raf knockdown in its mode of action and leads
to an increased level of p-MEK in WT B-Raf tumor cells, similar to
cells depleted of C-Raf. Our results support the previously reported
findings that B-Raf is the more potent activator of MEK in many
cells and tissues, whereas C-Raf expression is dispensable for the
transformed phenotype in human melanoma cells and may not
always represent a predominant effector of MAPK signaling in
human cells (24). Consistently, it has been shown that in the
presence of similar levels of p-ERK, p-MEK levels are high in
B-RafV600E mutant tumor cells but low in B-Raf WT tumor cells.
The p-MEK levels are rapidly increased upon MEK inhibitor
(PD0325901 and AZD6244) treatment of WT B-Raf but not mutant
B-Raf cancer cells (14, 15). The feedback regulation was suggested
to occur at/above the level of MEK. B-RafV600E can evade the
feedback by up-regulation of the downstream effect proteins such

as DUSPs, Sprouty etc. (14, 15). High basal levels of p-MEK
occasionally observed in WT tumor cells may suggest an altered
feedback regulation of the pathway in these cells. Interestingly, the
WT tumor cells with high basal levels of p-MEK seem to be
sensitive to RO4927350 treatment (Fig. 2C). Besides B-RafV600E
mutation, identification of additional factors that can evade the
feedback regulation of the MAPK pathway in tumors may provide
new markers for prediction of response to MEK inhibitor
treatment.
To show a clinical utility for MEK inhibitors, key questions still
remain unanswered such as in which cancer patient population,
what regimens, and what cotherapeutic partners may be most
effective. RO4927350 inhibits not only basal levels but also
mitogen-stimulated increases in MEK1/2 phosphorylation (Figs. 3
and 4). This suggests that RO4927350 may prevent exogenous
stimuli-induced MAPK pathway activation. Chemotherapeutic
agent–induced MAPK pathway has been suggested to play a role
in drug resistance (25). Thus, the combination of RO4927350 with

other cancer therapeutic agents may be of benefit in a clinical
setting. RO4927350 has shown antitumor activity as a single agent
(Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 5). Combination with standard
therapeutic agents has also shown additive or synergistic effects
(data not shown). Collectively, our studies suggest the potential of
RO4927350 and its analogues as targeted cancer therapeutic agents
for tumors with aberrant MAPK pathway activation.
