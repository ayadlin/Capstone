cell transformation (11). Although ERKs were reported to phosphorylate c-Jun at Ser63/73 (12), others found that purified JNKs,
not ERKs, phosphorylated c-Jun at Ser63/73 (13). This suggested
that another c-Jun kinase might exist, which is induced by growth
factors.
Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-3 was originally classified as a
cyclin-dependent kinase because of its high sequence identity
(76%) with both Cdc2 and Cdk2 (14). However, Cdk3 functions in
the regulation of the G1-S cell cycle transition in a manner distinct
from Cdk2 (15). Cdk3 participates in the G1-S progression, at least
partially, by binding with E2F-1, E2F-2, or E2F-3 through DP-1 and
enhancing their transcriptional activities, whereas Cdk2 phosphorylates protein substrates to promote S-phase entry (16). Transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdk3 (Cdk3-DN) caused an
accumulation of cells in G1 (15, 17). Cdk3 activity appears early in
the G1 phase (18), peaks at mid-G1 (17), and is required for entry
into S phase (15), resulting in increased proliferation as well as
cell transformation (17). In addition, Cdk3 mediates phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Ser 807/811) during the G0
phase (19), but phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk3 alone is insufficient
to inactivate Rb to promote G1 entry, which requires cyclin C
participation (20). Cdk3-DN inhibited Rb phosphorylation (Ser
807/811), preventing G0 exit (19). Although Cdk3 is a key regulator
in the control of the G1-S cell cycle transition, the role of Cdk3 in
cell cycle regulation as well as proliferation and cell transformation
is only partially elucidated. Furthermore, the downstream target of
Cdk3 involved in proliferation and cell transformation has not been
clearly identified.
Here, we show that c-Jun is a novel substrate of Cdk3 induced by
stimulation with growth factors such as EGF. Cdk3 phosphorylates
c-Jun at Ser63/73 and increases AP-1 activity, resulting in enhanced
anchorage-independent cell transformation. This report is the first
to show that c-Jun is a novel substrate of Cdk3 induced by growth
factors, which occurs independently of the JNK signaling pathway.

Abstract
c-Jun is a component of the activator protein-1 (AP-1)
complex, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene
expression, cell proliferation, and cell transformation, as well
as cancer development. Herein, we found that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-3, but not Cdk2 or c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase, is a novel kinase of c-Jun induced by stimulation with
growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Cdk3
was shown to phosphorylate c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in vitro
and ex vivo. EGF-induced Cdk3 activation caused c-Jun
phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73, resulting in increased
AP-1 transactivation. Ectopic expression of Cdk3 resulted in
anchorage-independent cell transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells
induced by EGF and foci formation stimulated by constitutively active Ras (RasG12V), which was mediated by AP-1 in
NIH3T3 cells. These results showed that the Cdk3/c-Jun
signaling axis plays an important role in EGF-stimulated
cell proliferation and cell transformation. [Cancer Res
2009;69(1):272–81]

Introduction
c-Jun was originally identified as the normal cellular counterpart
of the viral Jun oncoprotein (v-Jun) encoded by an avian sarcoma
virus (ASV17; ref. 1). Exposure of cells to phorbol esters, growth
factors, and transforming oncogenes, such as Ras, led to an
increase in c-Jun transcriptional activity (2). Subsequent studies
identified Ser63 and Ser73 as major sites of c-Jun phosphorylation,
and modification of these residues stimulated c-Jun transactivation
(3–5). Initially, the prototypic mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERK) were believed
to modify these residues (4). However, the cloning of a new
subfamily of MAP kinases, the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK;
ref. 6), or stress-activated protein kinases (7), led to a re-evaluation
of this scenario (8). Cellular JNKs are activated by cytokines (e.g.,
tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1) and by exposure to
environmental stresses (e.g., osmotic stress, redox stress, and
radiation; ref. 9). We found that when mouse skin was exposed
to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), JNK phosphorylation at Thr183/Tyr185 was not changed (10). TPA or epidermal
growth factor (EGF) is known to induce ERK phosphorylation and
increase activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity along with malignant

10 d, and colonies were scored using a microscope and the Image-Pro PLUS
computer software program (v.4, Media Cybermetics) as described (24).
Foci formation assay. Transformation of NIH3T3 cells was done
following standard protocols (25). Cells were transiently transfected with
combinations of pcDNA3-H-RasG12V (100 ng), Cdk3 (2.5 Ag), c-Jun (2.5 Ag),
or c-Jun M63/73 (2.5 Ag) and pcDNA3-mock (as compensation to achieve
equal amount of DNA) DNA and then cultured in 5% calf serum-DMEM
for 2 wk. The media were changed every 3 d. Foci were fixed, stained with
0.5% crystal violet, and counted with a microscope and the Image-Pro PLUS
(v.4) software program.
Mammalian two-hybrid assay. HEK293 cells (2.0  104) were seeded
into 48-well plates and incubated for 18 h before transfection. The DNAs,
pACT-c-Jun, pBIND-Cdk3, and pG5-Luciferase (pG5-luc), were combined
in the same molar ratio and the total amount of DNA was not more than
100 ng/well. The transfection was done using jetPEI following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The cells were disrupted by addition of
lysis buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L aprotinin,
and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] directly into each well of the
48-well plate, and aliquots of 20 AL were added to each well of a 96-well
luminescence plate. The luminescence activity was measured automatically
by computer program (MTX Lab, Inc.). Equal transfection efficiency was
normalized with Renilla luciferase activity, and the relative firefly luciferase
activity was calculated and normalized based on the pG5-luciferase basal
control.
Immunoprecipitation/kinase assay of Cdk3. To study the effect of
EGF on the induction of Cdk3 activity, Cdk3 or Cdk3-DN stably transfected
cells (1.0  106) were cultured for 12 to 24 h in 100-mm dishes. At 70% to
80% confluence, cells were stimulated with EGF at various doses (0, 10, 20,
40 ng/mL) or with 20 ng EGF for different times (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 h), washed
once with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and disrupted in 250 AL of lysis buffer
[25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmol/L
Na3 VO4, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L aprotinin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. The clarified supernatant fractions containing
equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a
Cdk3 antibody. The Cdk3 kinase assay was carried out as described by
Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, the immune complex was added to 2.5 AL
of 10 kinase buffer [250 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 20 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L Na3 VO4, 100 mmol/L
MgCl2], 2.5 AL (2.5 Ag) of a GST-c-Jun fusion protein, 10 AL of diluted
ATP/cocktail (Upstate Biotechnology), 10 ACi of [g-32P]ATP, and H2O to a
final volume of 25 AL. The reaction was incubated at 30jC for 30 min and
then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated-GST-c-Jun was visualized
by autoradiography.
Immunofluorescence assay. Cdk3 and mock stably transfected cells
(1.0  103) were seeded in eight-chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at
37jC, 5% CO2. The cells were washed at each time point, fixed in 4%
formalin, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/1 PBS for 10 min. The
cells were hybridized with a c-Jun mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200) and a
Cdk3 rabbit antibody (1:100) together at room temperature for 4 h. The cells
were washed and hybridized at room temperature for 1 h with a goat antimouse antibody conjugated with Texas red for detection of c-Jun and with a
goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with FITC for detection of Cdk3. Cells
were washed again and observed under a fluorescence microscope (200).
To analyze colocalization of endogenous Cdk3 and phosphorylated c-Jun,
SaoS-2 cells (3  104) were seeded into two-chamber slides and cultured
overnight. The cells were fixed with 4% formalin, permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100, and then hybridized with a Cdk3 rabbit antibody and a
phospho-c-Jun (Ser63/73) mouse antibody at 37jC for 2 h. The slides were
washed and incubated with anti-mouse goat antibody conjugated with
Texas red and anti-rabbit goat antibody conjugated with FITC at 37jC for
1 h. The slides were observed under a confocal microscope.

cells (5% FBS-MEM) were cultured in growth medium supplemented with
antibiotics at 37jC and 5% CO2. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with
10% calf bovine serum and antibiotics at 37jC and 5% CO2. Cells were
maintained by splitting at 80% to 90% confluence and media changed every
3 d. For transfection experiments, cells were split and the expression vector
induced when cells were 50% to 60% confluent using jetPEI (Qbiogen),
following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. For stable transfection,
JB6 cells (5.0  105) in 5% FBS-MEM were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes.
After culturing at 37jC in 5% CO2 for 16 h, the cells were transfected with
2 Ag of pRcCMV-HA-Cdk3, pCMV-HA-Cdk3DN, or pcDNA3.1 (mock) using
jetPEI. Cdk3, Cdk3-DN, and mock stably transfected cells were obtained by
selection for G418 resistance (400 Ag/mL) and further confirmed by
assessing Cdk3 activity and expression.
Construction of expression vectors. pCMV-HA-Cdk2 (pHA-Cdk2,
Cdk2 in pCMV-Bam-neo), pCMV-HA-Cdk2-DN (pHA-Cdk2-DN, dominantnegative Cdk2 in pCMV-Bam-neo), pRcCMV-HA-Cdk3 (pHA-Cdk3, Cdk3 in
pRcCMV), and pcDNA3-cyclin C were gifts from Dr. Barrett J. Rollins
(Department of Medical Oncology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;
ref. 19). The pHis6-tagged c-Jun was kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann
(European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany; ref. 21).
The c-Jun fragment was generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) at the BamHI/XhoI site to
generate a GST-c-Jun plasmid (pGST-c-Jun; refs. 22, 23). The mutant GSTc-Jun plasmid was generated by the QuikChange II Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit and c-Jun mutant primers (for Ser63 mutation, sense:
5¶-CGACCTTCTATGACGATGCC-3¶, antisense: 5¶-GGGCATCGTCATAGAAGGTCG-3¶; for Ser73, sense: 5¶-AGCGGACCTTATGGCTACAGT-3¶,
antisense: 5¶-ACTGTAGCCATAAGGTCCGCT-3¶). Mutant plasmids were
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Reporter gene assays. The AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid construct
contains the 73 to +63 collagenase promoter sequence (23). AP-1
transactivation activity was analyzed by transfection of the AP-1-luc
reporter plasmid with various expression vector combinations of Cdk3,
Cdk2, c-Jun, c-Jun M63/73, Cdk3-DN, and/or cyclin C. Cells were disrupted
with lysis buffer (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) at room
temperature for 30 min by gentle shaking and analyzed for firefly luciferase
activity. The AP-1-luc luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla
luciferase activity (phRL-SV40).
3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. To estimate cell proliferation, SaoS-2
cells harboring pU6pro-si-mock (mock) or pU6pro-si-Cdk3 (si-Cdk3) were
seeded (4  103) into 96-well plates in 100 AL of 15% FBS/McCoy’s 5A
medium and incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2. After culturing for 24 h, 20 AL of
the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega) were added to each well
and cells were then incubated for 1 h in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator. To stop
the reaction, 25 AL of 10% SDS were added and absorbance was measured at
492 and 690 nm.
Construction of siRNA vectors. The pU6pro vector (provided by
David L. Turner, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to
construct pU6pro-si-mock (si-mock) and Pu6pro-si-Cdk3 (si-Cdk3) following the recommended protocol.1 For the si-mock and si-Cdk3, we
synthesized primers for the si-mock (general scramble: sense, 5¶-TTTGACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTTCAAGAGACACCTATAACAACGGTAGTTTTTT-3¶,
and antisense, 5¶-CTAGAAAAAACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTCTCTTGAACACCTATAACAACGGTAGT-3¶) and for si-Cdk3 (sense, 5¶-TTTGTGAGTTGGGTGCCATCAAGTTCAAGAGACTTGATGGCACCCAACTCATTTTT-3¶,
and antisense, 5¶-CTAGAAAAATGAGTTGGGTGCCATCAAGTCTCTTGAACTTGATGGCACCCAACTCA-3¶). All constructs were confirmed by restriction
enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing.
Anchorage-independent cell transformation assay. To determine
Cdk3 function in cell transformation induced by growth factors, JB6 cells
were stably transfected with a mock vector or Cdk3. Cells (8  103/mL)
were exposed to EGF (20 ng/mL) in 1 mL of 0.3% basal medium Eagle’s
agar/10% FBS. Cultures were maintained in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator for

SP motif at Ser63 and Ser73 (Ser63/73; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
We conducted in vitro kinase reactions and analyzed phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63/73 by Western blot (Fig. 1C). The results
confirmed that Cdk3 phosphorylated c-Jun at either Ser63 or Ser73.
Although Cdk3, but not Cdk2, was shown to rescue Cdk3-DN–
induced G1 block, Cdk2 could still phosphorylate c-Jun because of
its high sequence identity with Cdk3 and its ability to complement
Cdc28 mutation in yeast (14). To examine this idea, we compared
the ability of active Cdk3, active Cdk2, and active JNK1 to
phosphorylate a GST-c-Jun fusion protein. In vitro kinase assay and
Western blot results showed that Cdk3 or JNK1 could phosphorylate c-Jun at Ser63/73 (Supplementary Fig. S1B, lanes 2 and 3),
whereas Cdk2 could not (Supplementary Fig. S1B, lane 4).
Furthermore, neither Cdk3 nor JNK1 was able to phosphorylate a
mutant (GST-c-Jun M63/73) c-Jun (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 5 versus
lanes 7 and 8, respectively). These data indicated that Cdk3, but
not Cdk2, specifically phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63/73 in vitro.
Cdk3-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73
modulates c-Jun/AP-1 activity ex vivo. We next examined
whether Cdk3-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73 could
occur ex vivo. pHis-c-Jun and pHA-Cdk3 or pHA-Cdk2 were
transfected into JB6 Cl41 cells and immunoprecipitated and
visualized with a His or hemagglutinin (HA) antibody, respectively

mammalian two-hybrid system. To identify partners, Cdk3,
containing the full-length open reading frame, was cloned into
the pBIND vector and used as bait. Various transcription factors
were cloned into the pACT vector. Protein interactions between
Cdk3 and individual transcription factors were measured with the
pG5-luciferase reporter gene assay. Results indicated that c-Jun
had a 15-fold higher interaction affinity with Cdk3 compared with
the control group transfected with pG5-Luc and Cdk3 (Fig. 1A,
lane 4). The pBIND-JNK1 interaction with c-Jun was used as a
positive control (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Based on this result, the
interaction of c-Jun and Cdk3 was chosen for further analysis. To
examine whether Cdk3 phosphorylated c-Jun, we generated a
GST-c-Jun fusion protein (22) and conducted an in vitro kinase
assay using [g-32P]ATP and commercially available active Cdk3 or
JNK1 with the same enzyme activity units (10 milliunits). The
results indicated that either Cdk3 or JNK1 phosphorylated c-Jun
(Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively) and, therefore, Cdk3 is a newly
discovered kinase that directly phosphorylates c-Jun in vitro.
To determine the sites of c-Jun that are phosphorylated by Cdk3,
we compared the amino acid similarity among various Cdk3
substrates. The Rb (19) and ik3-1/Cables (26) proteins exhibit a
conserved SP motif (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and further
comparison revealed that the c-Jun protein exhibited the same

Figure 1. Cdk3 phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in vitro. A, Cdk3 binds with c-Jun. Novel binding partners of Cdk3 were screened by the mammalian
two-hybrid assay as described in Materials and Methods. HEK293 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids as indicated and the binding affinity was
measured using the pG5-luciferase reporter plasmid assay. Luciferase activity, which was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity, is expressed as the fold change
in relative luminescence units normalized to the value (1.0) for cells transfected with pG5-Luc only. Columns, mean; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, Student’s t test.
B, Cdk3 phosphorylates c-Jun in vitro. The GST-c-Jun fusion protein served as substrate for active Cdk3 in the presence of [g-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was
resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and 32P-labeled GST-c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography (top ). The reaction of GST-c-Jun and JNK1 served as a positive
control, and Coomassie blue staining was used to verify equal loading (bottom ). C, Cdk3 phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63/73. To confirm that Ser63 and Ser73 are
phosphorylation target amino acids for Cdk3, an in vitro kinase assay was conducted with active Cdk3 and His-c-Jun. Phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 was
analyzed using phospho-specific antibodies and Western blotting. D, Cdk3 specifically phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73. To further confirm that Cdk3
phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73, a c-Jun protein harboring mutations at Ser63 and Ser73 was expressed in the BL21 bacterial strain, and an in vitro
kinase assay was conducted using Cdk3 and c-Jun. The phosphorylation of c-Jun was visualized by Western blot with a phospho-specific c-Jun antibody, which
recognizes phosphorylation of both Ser63 and Ser73. JNK1 was used as a positive control. IB, immunoblot.

Cdk3 Mediates c-Jun Phosphorylation

Figure 2. Cdk3 phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 ex vivo. A, Cdk3 interacts with c-Jun ex vivo. pHA-Cdk3 and pHis-c-Jun or pHA-Cdk2 and pHis-c-Jun plasmids
were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells and cultured 48 h at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then disrupted and His-c-Jun was immunoprecipitated
with a specific HisG antibody. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and coprecipitation of Cdk3 and Cdk2 was analyzed using a specific HA antibody and
Western blotting. B, Cdk3 phosphorylates c-Jun ex vivo . Various combinations of plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells and the c-Jun phosphorylated
(Ser63 or Ser73) protein level was analyzed using phospho-specific antibodies and Western blotting. h-Actin was used to verify equal protein loading. C, Cdk3,
but not Cdk2, specifically phosphorylates c-Jun at both Ser63 and Ser73. To confirm that Cdk3 specifically phosphorylates c-Jun ex vivo , various combinations of
plasmids containing sequences for Cdk3, Cdk2, Cdk2-DN, or c-Jun were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the c-Jun phosphorylated (Ser63 or Ser73) protein level was
analyzed using phospho-specific antibodies and Western blotting. h-Actin was used to verify equal protein loading. D, Cdk3 mediates AP-1 activity and c-Jun
transactivation. Left, Cdk3, Cdk2, or Cdk3-DN was transfected with AP-1-Luc into HEK293 cells. The cells were cultured for 36 h and firefly luciferase activity was
measured as described in Materials and Methods. Right, a pGal4-c-Jun fusion plasmid was cotransfected with Cdk3 or Cdk3-DN together with the p5xGal4-luciferase
reporter plasmid. The cells were cultured for 36 h and firefly luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. For both graphs, the firefly
luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity (phRL-SV40). Columns, mean; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, Student’s t test.

left, lane 1 versus lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, combined
transfection of Cdk3 or Cdk3-DN with p5xGal4-luciferase reporter
and pGal4-c-Jun plasmids indicated that AP-1 transactivation
corresponded with an increase of c-Jun transactivation activity
(Fig. 2D, right, lane 2). Taken together, these results showed that
Cdk3 phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63/73 induced formation of
the c-Jun/AP-1 complex, resulting in increased AP-1 transactivation
activity.
EGF-induced endogenous c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/
73 is mediated by Cdk3 and not by JNK. To analyze the effect of
Cdk3 on endogenous c-Jun/AP-1 activation ex vivo, we chose SaoS2, HaCaT, and A431 cells because these cells are very responsive to
EGF stimulation (27–29). SaoS-2, an osteosarcoma cell line, and
A431, an epidermoid carcinoma cell line, showed a higher level
of Cdk3 protein expression compared with HaCaT cells, which
are an immortalized, nonmalignant human keratinocyte cell line
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We chose SaoS-2 cells for further study
because this cell line has been used previously to study Cdk3
function (19). To examine the biological significance of endogenous
c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73 by Cdk3, we first analyzed c-Jun
phosphorylation by inhibiting EGF stimulation with the EGF
receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AG1478. Results indicated that c-Jun

(Fig. 2A). The results indicated that His-c-Jun was coimmunoprecipitated with Cdk3 but not with Cdk2 (Fig. 2A). We then
transfected JB6 cells with various combinations of pHA-Cdk3,
pHA-Cdk3-DN, pHis-c-Jun, or pHis-c-Jun M63/73 to verify that
ectopic expression of Cdk3 could induce c-Jun phosphorylation at
Ser63/73 (Fig. 2B). Results indicated that c-Jun phosphorylation at
Ser63 and Ser73 was induced by cotransfection of pHA-Cdk3
(Fig. 2B, lane 1) but not by Cdk3-DN (Fig. 2B, lane 2), and the
mutant His-c-Jun M63/73 could not be phosphorylated by pHACdk3 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Moreover, the phosphorylation of c-Jun at
Ser63/73 was specifically induced by Cdk3 but not by Cdk2 (Fig. 2C,
lane 4 versus lane 1). These results showed that only Cdk3, and not
Cdk2, induced c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73 ex vivo. To
determine the biological significance of c-Jun phosphorylation by
Cdk3, we examined AP-1 activity with an AP-1-luciferase reporter
gene assay (pAP-1-Luc). Various combinations of pHA-Cdk3,
pHA-Cdk2, pHA-Cdk3-DN, and the pAP-1-Luc plasmid were
transfected into JB6 cells, and AP-1 transactivation activity
increased by f11-fold by Cdk3 transfection compared with
pAP-1 luciferase alone (Fig. 2D, left, lane 2). However, AP-1
transactivation activity was not changed by transfection with
either Cdk2 or Cdk3-DN compared with pAP-1-Luc alone (Fig. 2D,

Our previous study indicated that EGF stimulation induces cell
transformation mediated through AP-1 activity (30). Furthermore,
we found that EGF stimulation could not induce JNK phosphorylation at Thr183/Tyr185, a marker of JNK activation (31). To examine

phosphorylation induced by EGF was suppressed with EGFR
inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3A, top). Additional results indicated
that blocking EGFR activation also inhibits c-Jun/AP-1 luciferase
activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, bottom).

Cdk3 Mediates c-Jun Phosphorylation

Figure 4. EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation is mediated by Cdk3. A, endogenous Cdk3 is activated by EGF stimulation. SaoS-2 cells (2  106) were seeded into
10-cm dishes and cultured overnight in a 37jC, 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were stimulated with 20 ng/mL EGF and harvested at the indicated time point. The cells
were disrupted with kinase lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with a c-Jun antibody, and Cdk3 was detected with a Cdk3 antibody. Protein levels were analyzed
from the same cell lysates using specific antibodies and Western blotting, and h-actin was used to verify equal protein loading. B, using the same cell lysates from A,
Cdk3 was immunoprecipitated with a Cdk3 antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was conducted using [g-32P]ATP and GST-c-Jun as described in Materials and
Methods. The 32P-labeled phospho-bands were visualized by autoradiography, and immunoprecipitated Cdk3 was visualized by Western blotting. C, endogenous Cdk3
colocalizes with phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser63 and Ser73). SaoS-2 cells (2  104) were seeded into two-chamber slides and cultured overnight. The cells were or
were not stimulated with 20 ng/mL EGF for 15 min and then an immunofluorescence assay was conducted as described in Materials and Methods. The cells were
observed under a confocal microscope (200).

activity (Fig. 3C). SaoS-2 cells were pretreated with PD98059 (MEK1/
2 inhibitor) or SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) for 30 minutes and then
stimulated with 20 ng/mL EGF. The Western blot profiles indicated
that MEK inhibition only suppressed ERK phosphorylation and
not c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73 (Fig. 3C, top). Furthermore,
the JNK inhibitor had no effect on EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation at either Ser63 or Ser73 (Fig. 3C, bottom). We found that
transfection of HA-Cdk3 enhanced SaoS-2 proliferation (Fig. 3D),
whereas HA-Cdk3-DN slightly suppressed SaoS-2 proliferation
(Fig. 3D). These results supported our hypothesis that EGF-mediated
c-Jun phosphorylation does not occur through ERK or JNK signaling.
EGF stimulation induces the interaction of endogenous
Cdk3 and c-Jun. To analyze the ex vivo interaction of endogenous

whether EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation is mediated by JNK
or Cdk3, we analyzed phosphorylation of JNK and ERK after
stimulation with EGF (20 ng/mL). Results indicated that although
phosphorylation of ERK was stimulated by EGF at 5 minutes,
continued over 30 minutes, and decreased at 60 minutes (Fig. 3B,
top, rows 1 and 2), JNK phosphorylation was not detected over
the same period of time (Fig. 3B, top, rows 3 and 4), indicating
that EGF does not activate JNK. On the other hand, c-Jun
phosphorylation at Ser63/73 was increased at 5 minutes, continued
to at least 60 minutes, and then slightly decreased at 120 minutes
after EGF stimulation (Fig. 3B, bottom). To avoid the possibility of the
involvement of either ERK or JNK as c-Jun kinases, we used chemical
compounds to inhibit MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) and JNK

The cells were then harvested and disrupted with luciferase lysis buffer and the luciferase activity was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. The

Cdk3 and c-Jun by EGF stimulation, we conducted a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. In the coimmunoprecipitation results,
we found that Cdk3 and c-Jun binding increased at 5 minutes
after EGF stimulation, further increased by 60 minutes, and
decreased at 120 minutes (Fig. 4A, top), which closely matches the
c-Jun phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 4A, 4th row). Concurrently, the
total Cdk3 protein level was increased at 60 minutes and slightly
deceased at 120 minutes (Fig. 4A, 3rd row). In addition, EGF
stimulation increased Cdk3-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation as
shown by immunoprecipitation-kinase assay results using Hisc-Jun and [g-32P]ATP (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results
indicated that EGF stimulation enhanced the interaction of
Cdk3 and c-Jun, which resulted in the phosphorylation of c-Jun
at Ser63/73 by Cdk3. Next, we hypothesized that if Cdk3
phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser63/73 ex vivo, then these proteins
should colocalize. SaoS-2 cells were or were not stimulated with
EGF and colocalization of Cdk3 (FITC) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser63/
73) was examined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4C ). The
phosphorylated c-Jun and Cdk3 were barely detectable before
EGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). However, after EGF stimulation, the
phosphorylated c-Jun and Cdk3 levels were increased and
colocalized together (Fig. 4C). These results further showed that
EGF induces c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73, which is directly
mediated by Cdk3.

Knockdown of Cdk3 inhibits cell proliferation and c-Jun/
AP-1 activity. To analyze the knockdown effect of endogenous
Cdk3, we constructed pU6pro-si-general scramble (si-mock) and
pU6pro-si-Cdk3 (si-Cdk3) vectors as described in Materials and
Methods. The si-mock or si-Cdk3 was transfected into SaoS-2
cells and knockdown efficiency was analyzed by Western blot.
Transfection of si-Cdk3 suppressed the endogenous Cdk3 protein
level by f80% (Fig. 5A). Importantly, we found that knockdown of
Cdk3 by si-Cdk3 stable transfection inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73 (Fig. 5B). Suppression of c-Jun phosphorylation
by increasing amounts of si-Cdk3 was directly associated with
dose-dependent reductions in AP-1 luciferase activity (Fig. 5C) and
proliferation (Fig. 5D). These results showed that Cdk3-mediated
c-Jun activation increases c-Jun/AP-1 transcriptional activity and
induces proliferation.
The Cdk3-AP-1 signaling axis plays an important role in cell
transformation. The phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser63/73 is
associated with cell transformation (3, 12). A persistent alteration
in AP-1 activity results in enhanced oncogenic transformation (32)
and AP-1 activation is required to promote skin carcinogenesis
(33). The protein expression level of Cdk3 and c-Jun was observed
to be higher in A431 malignant human skin cancer cells compared
with immortalized HaCaT cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
results suggested that the Cdk3-c-Jun/AP-1 signaling axis plays an

The initial conclusion that ERK was a c-Jun kinase (4) was
re-evaluated when JNK was discovered and cloned (7). Purified JNK
phosphorylated c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73, whereas ERK did not (13).
Many potent JNK agonists are poor ERK agonists and vice versa (7),
suggesting that the level of c-Jun phosphorylation is associated
with the relative activation of ERK and JNK in response to different
stimuli. Evidence also indicates that the intensity and duration of
JNK activation and the degree of c-Jun Ser63/73 phosphorylation
correspond very well, but little or no correlation exists between
c-Jun phosphorylation and ERK activity (7, 13, 41). Constitutive
activation of growth-promoting signaling pathways such as Ras
and ERK leads to cell transformation. The Ras proteins play a key
role in signal transduction and regulation of proliferation (42, 43).
Ras signaling is mediated through MAP kinase kinase, which in
turn activates ERK. However, Ras only partially activates JNKs,
suggesting that other kinase(s) that phosphorylate c-Jun at Ser63/
73 must exist. When cells were stimulated with EGF, which is a
well-known tumor promoter that activates Ras, ERK phosphorylation was increased (Fig. 3B), whereas JNK phosphorylation was
not affected by EGF stimulation (Fig. 3B), indicating that c-Jun
phosphorylation at Ser63/73 induced by EGF does occur not
through JNK signaling. The purpose of the present study was to
identify novel kinase(s) that can phosphorylate c-Jun, and Cdk3
was found to be a c-Jun binding partner (Fig. 1A). Cdk3 could
phosphorylate c-Jun at Ser63/73 (Fig. 1B and C) and colocalize with
phosphorylated c-Jun following EGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). EGF
stimulation increased phosphorylated c-Jun and Cdk3 protein
levels over a similar time period (Fig. 4A). An EGFR inhibitor
suppressed EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation (Fig. 3A). Notably, knockdown of Cdk3 suppressed AP-1
luciferase activity and c-Jun phosphorylation, as well as proliferation (Fig. 5B–D), indicating that the Cdk3/c-Jun signaling axis has
an important function in proliferation induced by growth factors
such as EGF.
The DNA binding and transcriptional activities of c-Jun are
affected by events such as induction of AP-1 activity by TPA and
other tumor promoters, which reflects a posttranslational activating modification and which stimulates c-Jun protein engagement
in an autoregulatory loop (44, 45). AP-1 regulates cell cycle
progression by binding with the cyclin D1 gene promoter directly
(46) and suppresses stabilization of the p53 protein, resulting in
accumulation of the p21 protein (47). AP-1 transactivation was
required for tumor promotion in transgenic mice (33), and EGF
stimulation was reported to induce cell transformation through
AP-1 activation (30). A dominant negative c-Jun mutant blocked
H-Ras– and c-Jun–induced cell transformation (48). Stable expression of Cdk3 in JB6 Cl41 P+ cells enhanced cell transformation
induced by EGF (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, NIH3T3 cells harboring
constitutively active H-RasG12V and transfected with Cdk3 and c-Jun
exhibited more efficient foci formation compared with H-RasG12V
alone or H-RasG12V combined with Cdk3 (Fig. 6C), and the process
was mediated through AP-1 activation (Fig. 6B and D).
Cdk3 induces G0 exit into G1 in resting cells (19) and participates
in the G1 exit to S entry (16). Transfection of dominant negative
Cdk3 caused G1 accumulation (15) and, therefore, Cdk3 is involved
in cell cycle progression. Cdk3 kinase activity was not affected by
p16 or E2F-1 but was down-regulated with transient p27KIP1
expression (17). Ectopic Cdk3, but not Cdk2, enhanced Myc-induced
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth–associated Myc
activation (17), indicating that Cdk3 could have oncogenic
potential. Recently, Ren and Ronallins (19) found that cyclin C is a

important role in cell transformation. To examine this suggestion,
we established JB6 Cl41 cells stably expressing a mock vector or
Cdk3. Using these cells, we assessed EGF-induced anchorageindependent growth in soft agar (Fig. 6A) and found that Cdk3
stable cells induced f4.6-fold more cell transformation compared
with JB6/pcDNA4-mock cells (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, knockdown of
c-Jun with siRNA-c-Jun in Cdk3 stable JB6 Cl41 cells suppressed
colony formation in soft agar (Supplementary Fig. S3). Cdk3overexpressing stable cells also showed elevated c-Jun phosphorylation levels compared with pcDNA4-mock cells (Fig. 6B, top, rows
1 and 2). However, phosphorylation of JNK was not detectable
in either of the two cell types (Fig. 6B, top, row 5). Furthermore,
EGF-induced AP-1 activity was also enhanced by the introduction
of pcDNA4-Cdk3 (Fig. 6B, bottom), indicating that Cdk3-mediated
cell transformation might be mediated by c-Jun phosphorylation.
This notion was supported by results of a foci formation assay
using NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6C). Constitutively active RasG12V-induced
foci formation was increased by cotransfection with Cdk3
(Fig. 6C, bottom, 1st plate). The increased foci number induced by
the combination of RasG12V and Cdk3 was even more increased
by triple transfection of RasG12V, Cdk3, and c-Jun (Fig. 6C, bottom,
2nd plate), but not by including c-Jun M63/73 with RasG12V and
Cdk3 (Fig. 6C, bottom, 3rd plate). Furthermore, AP-1 luciferase
activity of NIH3T3 cells was also increased by cotransfection
of Cdk3 and c-Jun, but not by cotransfection of cells with Cdk2/
c-Jun (data not shown). In addition, cotransfection of Cdk3/c-Jun/
cyclin C further enhanced AP-1 luciferase activity compared
with Cdk3/c-Jun (Fig. 6D, lane 4 versus lane 6). Therefore, based
on overall results, we concluded that growth factor–mediated
Cdk3 activation induces c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63/73,
resulting in enhanced c-Jun/AP-1 transcriptional activity and cell
transformation.

Discussion
Growth factors and tumor promoters induce AP-1 activity,
indicating that AP-1 is important in growth control as well as cell
transformation. Several mechanisms account for stimulation of
AP-1 activity by growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and
UV radiation (34). The most important mediator of the growth
factor response is probably the ERK MAP kinase cascade, which is
activated through phosphorylation of ternary complex factors (35).
Our results showed that EGF stimulation induced phosphorylation
of ERK but not JNK (Figs. 3B and C and 6B). In contrast, a primary
stimulus that induces JNK phosphorylation is UV (34, 36, 37).
Although UV is a well-known activator of JNK and AP-1, previous
work indicated that ERK or other signaling pathways might also be
required for AP-1 activation (38, 39). Those results indicated that
the JNK and ERK signaling pathways might differentially lead to
phosphorylation of c-Jun depending on stimulation or cell context.
Furthermore, we found that the proteinase inhibitors I and II from
potatoes specifically inhibited AP-1 activity through a pathway that
is independent of the ERK, p38, or JNK pathway (40). Furthermore,
treatment with PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, or SP600125, a JNK
inhibitor, did not affect EGF-induced c-Jun phosphorylation
(Fig. 6B) in SaoS-2 cells, indicating that other signaling molecule(s)
must exist to phosphorylate c-Jun. Thus, the observation in the
present study that Cdk3 is a novel kinase for phosphorylating c-Jun
at Ser63 and Ser73 is extremely important in understanding how
growth factors can induce cell proliferation or cell transformation
through the regulation of AP-1 transactivation activity.

novel binding partner with Cdk3, and Cdk3/cyclin C promotes Rbdependent G0 exit, the regulation of which is similar to regulation
of the G1-S transition (49). Our results showed that knockdown of
Cdk3 by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation (Fig. 5D) through
inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 5B) and AP-1 transactivation activity (Fig. 5C). In summary, Cdk3 is a well-known
kinase with a newly discovered function of phosphorylating c-Jun
resulting in AP-1 transactivation, which is critical for proliferation
as well as cell transformation. Growth factor–induced c-Jun
phosphorylation occurs independently of JNK, and this finding
suggests that Cdk3 may be a new target for anticancer drug
development.
