Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are
effective against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations,
but resistance is inevitable. Mechanisms of acquired resistance include T790M mutations
and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). One potential strategy for overcoming
this resistance is the inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) based on our previous
studies showing that mesenchymal NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to PLK1 inhibition
than epithelial cell lines. To determine the extent to which PLK1 inhibition overcomes
EGFR TKI resistance we measured the effects of the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib alone
and in combination with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in vitro and in vivo in EGFR mutant
NSCLC cell lines with acquired resistance to erlotinib. Two erlotinib-resistant cell lines
that underwent EMT had higher sensitivity to volasertib, which caused G2/M arrest
and apoptosis, than their parental cells. In all NSCLC cell lines with T790M mutations,
volasertib markedly reduced erlotinib resistance. All erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines
with T790M mutations had higher sensitivity to erlotinib plus volasertib than to erlotinib
alone, and the combination treatment caused G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Compared
with either agent alone, the combination treatment also caused significantly more DNA
damage and greater reductions in tumor size. Our results suggest that PLK1 inhibition is
clinically effective against NSCLC that becomes resistant to EGFR inhibition through EMT
or the acquisition of a T790M mutation. These results uncover new functions of PLK1
inhibition in the treatment of NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.

progression-free survival and better quality of life [1, 2].
However, the disease inevitably acquires resistance to
EGFR TKIs. Mechanisms of this resistance include the
development of a second-site EGFR resistance mutation
(T790M); the activation of parallel signaling pathways,
including cMET, HER2, FGFR, Mer and AXL; up
regulation of SCRN1; epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT); and small cell transformation [4–11]. Drugs that
inhibit glutaminase C, JAK, Mer and Src are effective
in some EGFR TKI resistance models [8–10, 12]. In
addition, resistance to EGFR inhibition can result from
an innate mechanism whereby the short-term inhibition
of downstream AKT leads to decreased Ets1 expression
and subsequently decreased levels of DUSP6, the
negative regulator of ERK1/2 [13]. Patients who have
NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs have
limited therapeutic options. Although AZD9291 has
efficacy against NSCLC with T790M mutations, effective
strategies for overcoming other resistance mechanisms
are lacking [4, 14]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for
developing new effective treatments to overcome or delay
acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.
One potential strategy to overcome acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs is the inhibition of polo-like
kinase 1 (PLK1). PLK1, which is overexpressed in various
malignancies, including NSCLC, regulates many cell cycle
events, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation,
kinetochore assembly, and bipolar spindle formation. It
also modulates DNA damage responses, including the
recovery of DNA damage checkpoints, and contributes to
oncogenesis by inducing chromosome instability. Inhibiting
PLK1 in NSCLC with acquired EGFR TKI resistance
has been investigated previously. Crystal et al. subjected
NSCLC cells with acquired EGFR TKI resistance to
genetic and pharmacologic screens and identified diverse
drug sensitivities in the resulting models. They found that
although most erlotinib-resistant (ER) cell lines were not
sensitive to the 76 agents tested, the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536
was effective against five ER NSCLC cell lines and two
patient-derived cell lines [15]. However, the authors did not
investigate the mechanism underlying the PLK1 inhibitor’s
action. Our own studies revealed that mesenchymal
NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to PLK1 inhibition
than epithelial cell lines are in vitro and in vivo, indicating
that PLK1 inhibition may be effective against NSCLC with
acquired EGFR-TKI resistance that had undergone EMT.
We hypothesize that PLK1 inhibition may be effective
in NSCLC with acquired EGFR-TKI resistance that had
undergone EMT based on our own previous studies showed
that mesenchymal NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to
PLK1 inhibition than epithelial cell lines are in vitro and
in vivo [16]. Other studies have shown that both NSCLC
cell lines and patient tumors undergo EMT when they
acquire resistance to EGFR TKIs [15, 17–21]. For example,
HCC827 cells resistant to the EGFR TKI gefitinib produced
transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and when
parental HCC827 cells were exposed to TGF-β1, they
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

underwent EMT and became resistant to gefitinib; however,
the suppression of EMT did not prevent this acquired
resistance [17]. In addition, PLK1 inhibition has been
shown to significantly augment the anti-tumor effect of
EGFR inhibitors in EGFR inhibition–resistant glioblastoma
cell lines harboring EGFRvIII mutations [22].
PLK1 regulates many cell cycle events, including
mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, kinetochore
assembly, and bipolar spindle formation [23]. In addition
to governing mitotic progression, PLK1 also modulates
DNA damage responses, including the recovery of DNA
damage checkpoints. PLK1 is overexpressed in various
malignancies, including NSCLC, melanoma, colorectal
cancer, and prostate cancer, and contributes to oncogenesis
by inducing chromosome instability [24, 25]. PLK1 levels
in NSCLC are correlated inversely with survival [26]. In
cancer cells, the knock down [27] or inhibition of PLK1
results in a variety of biological effects, including G2/M
accumulation, spindle defects, chromosomal alignment
defects, mitotic slippage, apoptosis, senescence, and
defective centrosome maturation or separation [28–31].
Among the PLK1 inhibitors in clinical trials, volasertib
(BI6727) has received breakthrough status for the
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration and is being studied in different
malignancies including NSCLC [32, 33].
One limitation of using single-agent PLK1 inhibition
to treat ER NSCLC is that there are multiple, diverse
mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
In addition, single tumors may have multiple mechanisms
of resistance simultaneously due to heterogeneity [17].
Finally, as Crystal et al. found, single agents were not
effective in the vast majority of ER NSCLC models they
developed [15]. In the present study, therefore, we tested
the combination of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and
the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib in ER NSCLC models to
determine the extent to which PLK1 inhibition overcomes
EGFR TKI resistance.
On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesize
that PLK1 inhibition is effective against NSCLC with
acquired EGFR-TKI resistance that undergone EMT and
may reverse EGFR-TKI resistance. In the current study,
we measured the effects of the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib
alone and in combination with the EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib in a panel of ER NSCLC cells lines in vitro and
in vivo. We also investigated the mechanism underlying
the observed synergistic effects of the drugs.

RESULTS
Erlotinib resistant NSCLC cell lines have higher
PLK1 expression and greater sensitivity to PLK1
inhibition

in vitro to establish 7 NSCLC cell lines with acquired
erlotinib resistance (ER). Five ER clones had secondary
T790M EGFR mutations and two did not. Western blotting
for E-cadherin and vimentin expression was consistent
with EMT in those 2 ER lines lacking a T790M EGFR
mutation (Figure 1). A CellTiter-Glo assay assessing the
cells’ sensitivity to erlotinib confirmed maintenance of the
ER phenotype (Table 1).
Our prior research demonstrated that mesenchymal
NSCLC cell lines are more sensitive to PLK1 inhibitors
than epithelial NSCLC cell lines are. In the present study,
therefore, we used the CellTiter-Glo assay to assess ER
clones’ sensitivity to the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib (Table 1,
Supplementary Figure 1). We calculated the IC50, IC70,
and area under the dose response curve (AUC) values of
volasertib because the dose response curves often plateau
at or near the IC50 value and because we previously found
that the IC70 and AUC values are better discriminators of
sensitivity [16]. The two ER lines that underwent EMT
were more sensitive to volasertib after undergoing EMT.
We tested the effect of 60 nM volasertib in two of these
lines (HCC4006-ER2 and HCC827-ER3) and found that the
agent caused marked G2/M arrest and apoptosis (Figure 2),
which supports our hypothesis that EMT enhances ER
NSCLC cells’ sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors.
Compared with parental cell lines, most ER
cell lines with diverse mechanisms of resistance had
significantly greater PLK1 protein expression (Figure 1).

Increased volasertib sensitivity was not correlated with
increased PLK1 expression (p = 0.81).

PLK1 and EGFR inhibitors are synergistic and
cause apoptosis in NSCLC cells bearing T790M
EGFR mutations
As single agents are not effective in the vast majority
of ER NSCLC models [15], we investigated the effect of
combined PLK1 and EGFR inhibition on ER cell lines.
The combination of volasertib and erlotinib was synergistic
in all ER clones with T790M mutations (i.e., PC9-ER
clones; Figure 3). In contrast, the combination was largely
antagonistic in ER cell lines that had undergone EMT,
although volasertib alone was effective in these cell lines,
as noted above (Supplementary Figure 2).
We assessed the drug combination’s effect on the
cell cycle and apoptosis in two cell lines against which the
agents acted synergistically (PC9-ER9 and PC9-ER11)
and in two cell lines against which the agents did not act
synergistically (HCC4006-ER2 and HCC827-ER3) using
relevant drug concentrations of 60 nM volasertib and 2 µM
erlotinib [33, 34]. Despite erlotinib resistance, erlotinib still
induced G1 arrest and a reduction in proliferation (S phase).
As expected, volasertib by itself induced G2/M arrest and
increased polyploidy (> 4N). However, ER PC9 cell lines
treated with volasertib plus erlotinib had a pronounced
sub-G0 fraction as well as polyploid cells (Figure 4A). The

cell cycle patterns of the HCC4006-ER2 and HCC827-ER3
cell lines treated with the combination were similar to those
of the HCC4006-ER2 and HCC827-ER3 cell lines treated
with volasertib alone (Figure 2).
Consistent with the increase of the sub-G0 fraction,
substantial apoptosis, as measured by assessing PARP
cleavage and performing a TUNEL assay, occurred in the
ER PC9 cell lines treated with the combination of volasertib
and erlotinib. Single agents did not cause significant
apoptosis (Figure 4B), which was consistent with the results
of the CellTiter-Glo assay. Apoptosis in the HCC4006-ER2
and HCC827-ER3 clones was significantly increased after
treatment with volasertib alone but was not enhanced with
erlotinib treatment (Figure 2).

canonical downstream signaling pathways, we treated PC9ER9 and PC9-ER11 cells with erlotinib and/or volasertib
and used Western blotting to assess the expression of key
signaling proteins (Figure 5A). Volasertib alone did not
affect the activation of EGFR, AKT, or ERK. Despite the
cells’ T790M mutations, erlotinib inhibited EGFR signaling
modestly. The addition of PLK1 inhibition did not enhance
the inhibitory effect of EGFR inhibition on ERK in either
cell line but did enhance this effect on AKT in PC9-ER9
cells. This result demonstrates that the dramatic synergy of
volasertib and erlotinib did not result from the bypassing of
EGFR to enhance the inhibition of PI3K/AKT or Ras/ERK.
PLK1 regulates the DNA damage response
checkpoint [35, 36], and PLK1 inhibition can cause DNA
damage [28, 29, 31]. To determine the extent to which PLK1
inhibition induces DNA damage in ER NSCLC cells, we
incubated the cells with volasertib or erlotinib for 48 h and
then subjected them to a comet assay which measures both
single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks (Figure 5B).
Erlotinib alone did not induce increased DNA damage,
but volasertib alone did. The combination treatment also
enhanced DNA damage. To determine whether the DNA
damage response was engaged, we used Western blotting to
measure γ-H2AX, CHK1/ATR, and CHK2/ATM expression

however, the co-administration of volasertib and erlotinib
enhanced the phosphorylation of these proteins.

effective than inhibition of either target alone in
NSCLC xenograft models

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that ER NSCLC cell lines
were more sensitive to PLK1 inhibition after undergoing
EMT. ER NSCLC cell lines that acquired T790M EGFR
mutations were more resistant to single-agent PLK1
inhibitors than the parental cell lines were, but the addition
of PLK1 inhibition reversed erlotinib resistance. The
combination treatment led to DNA damage in ER NSCLC
cell lines harboring T790M EGFR mutations marked
apoptosis in the ER cell lines with T790M mutations, and
decreased tumor growth in mice.
To our knowledge, only one other study has shown
that PLK1 inhibition is effective in ER NSCLC models
[15]. That study’s results are consistent with those of
the present study, in that a minority of the models were
sensitive to PLK1 inhibition. In the current study, all ER

We then assessed the activity of PLK1 and EGFR
inhibition in a PC9-ER9 xenograft model. Compared with
the control treatment, treatment with volasertib or erlotinib
alone did not inhibit tumor growth (p > 0.05). However,
compared with treatment with either agent alone, the
combination treatment significantly reduced tumor size
(p < 0.01, Figure 6A). To determine the inhibitory effect
of the treatments on cell proliferation and apoptosis in the
xenograft models, we measured the expression of Ki67
and caspase-3 protein by immunohistochemistry. Caspase
3 staining for the combination treatment group was higher
than that for either single-agent treatment group, but this
difference was not significant (Figure 6B). Consistent
with the different treatments’ effects on the cell cycle,

both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the manipulation of
EMT status using TGF-β or ectopic expression of miR200
or ZEB1 altered cells’ sensitivity to PLK1 [16].
Surprisingly, volasertib and erlotinib had strikingly
synergy against NSCLC cells with the T790M mutation,
despite the fact that these cell lines were more resistant to
the single agents than the parental line was. The T790M
mutation is the dominant mechanism of acquired EGFR
TKI resistance, accounting for more than half of the cases
of NSCLC resistant to the drugs. The T790M mutation in

NSCLC cell lines that became more sensitive to PLK1
inhibition had undergone EMT, an established mechanism
of acquired EGFR TKI resistance [18, 20]. Currently,
there is no effective strategy for overcoming EGFR TKI
resistance that is gained via EMT. One potential strategy
is to inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL [21], but this
approach is not universally effective [37]. Our previous
study showed that mesenchymal NSCLC cell lines
were more sensitive to three PLK1 inhibitors (BI2536,
volasertib, and GSK461364) than epithelial cell lines were

EGFR decreases the affinity of EGFR TKIs to the ATPbinding pocket of the catalytic region and reactivates the
EGFR signaling pathway [37]. Several mutant-specific
EGFR TKIs, such as AZD9291, CO-1686, ASP8273, and
EGF816, are effective against T790M-mutant NSCLC.
AZD9291 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of NSCLC patients
with acquired T790M mutations [38, 39]. Our finding that
PLK1 inhibition combined with erlotinib could overcome
the EGFR-TKI resistance with T790M mutation will
provide new treatment strategy for the acquired EGFRTKI resistance in NSCLC.
In the present study, volasertib had no inhibitory
effect on the canonical EGFR signaling pathways (i.e.,
MEK/ERK or AKT). Erlotinib alone had partial inhibitory
effects on EGFR, ERK, and AKT phosphorylation, which
is consistent with prior studies showing that the T790M
mutation typically occurs in a minor population of EGFR
TKI-resistant cells and that EGFR TKI–resistant cells
retain drug-sensitive alleles. However, erlotinib did not
completely inhibit downstream AKT and ERK, which is
consistent with previous studies’ findings that NSCLC
with the T790M mutation is resistant to EGFR TKIs
[40, 41]. The combination of PLK1 and EGFR inhibition
did not consistently inhibit ERK or AKT more than EGFR
inhibition alone did, suggesting that the PLK1 pathway
does not simply serve as “bypass” of EGFR-dependent
pathways to facilitate resistance to EGFR inhibition.
The present study demonstrated that PLK1
inhibition combined with erlotinib significantly enhanced
DNA damage and apoptosis. PLK1 has a pivotal role in
maintaining mitotic entry and progression as well as DNA
damage checkpoints [42]. PLK1 depletion leads to varying
lengths of mitotic delay and DNA damage [28, 29]. A
previous in vitro study showed that inhibition or knock
down of PLK1 in six cancer cell lines led to increased
histone H3 phosphorylation (pHisH3) at 6 h followed by
increased γ-H2AX expression at 24 h and increased PARP
cleavage at 24–48 h, with senescence occurring in some
of these cell lines after 2 weeks [29]. The timing of these
changes suggests a model in which mitotic arrest leads to
DNA damage and apoptosis and/or senescence. Yim, et.
al.’s study showed that PLK1 knock down in HeLa cells
led to DNA damage at the G1/S phase with increased
ATM/CHK2 activation and γ-H2AX expression. The
proposed mechanism is that the loss of PLK1 activity
allows Emi1 accumulation, APC inactivation, and geminin
accumulation, which lead to chromatin disruption and
subsequent DNA damage [28]. Our results indicated that
the co-administration of volasertib and erlotinib led to a
strikingly increase in the expression of γ-H2AX, which
reflects double-strand DNA breaks and DNA checkpoint
ATR/CHK1 kinase activation. These results suggest that
DNA damage is potentiated the lethality of PLK1 inhibition
plus EGFR inhibition. EGFR and PI3K/AKT have been
shown to enhance DNA repair after radiotherapy-induced
DNA damage [43, 44]. The results of our study suggest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that the addition of EGFR inhibition enhances the effect of
PLK1 inhibition by further inhibiting DNA repair.
One limitation of our study was that we had relatively
few ER lines in each category. Another limitation of our
study is that we did not use an animal model with an intact
immune system. Thus, we did not incorporate immune
escape as a potential resistance mechanism [45]. The
lack of heterogeneity is another limitation of laboratory
resistance models.
Our findings suggest that PLK1 inhibition is
therapeutically useful in NSCLC that becomes resistant
to EGFR inhibition by EMT or acquisition of a T790M
mutation. The two ER NSCLC cell lines that underwent
EMT were sensitive to volasertib as a single agent. In
contrast, the addition of volasertib overcame erlotinib
resistance in all models with the T790M mutation. PLK1
inhibition combined with EGFR inhibition induced
apoptosis by enhancing DNA damage. This combination
strategy could be readily applied in the clinic for the
treatment of NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR
TKIs. Together, these results uncover new functions of
PLK1 inhibition in the treatment of NSCLC with the T790M
mutation that has acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Erlotinib and volasertib were obtained from Selleck
Chemicals (Houston, TX) and dissolved in DMSO as 10
mmol/L stock solutions. The mouse monoclonal antiPLK1 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (New York,
NY). Antibodies against PLK1, E-cadherin, vimentin,
PARP, p-EGFR(Tyr1068), EGFR, p-ERK(Tyr202/204),
ERK, p-AKT(Ser473), AKT, γ-H2AX, p-ATM(Ser1981),
ATM, p-ATR(Ser428), ATR, p-CHK1(Ser345), CHK1,
p-CHK2(Tyr68), and CHK2 were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).

Cell culture and development of ER clones
Three EGFR-mutant, erlotinib-sensitive human
lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC9, HCC4006, and
HCC827) were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. ER cells were
developed by subjecting these cells to chronic, repeated
exposure to stepwise-increased concentrations of erlotinib
as described previously [46]. The established ER cell lines
were maintained in erlotinib at a concentration of 1 µM.

Cell viability assays
NSCLC cells were seeded at 800–1000 cells/well

treatment, cell viability was estimated using the CellTiterGlo luminescent assay (Promega, Madison, WI) as
previously described [16]. For each cell line, six technical
replicates were tested at each concentration, and at least
two biological replicates were tested on different days.
IC50 and IC70 values were estimated from the best-fit doseresponse model selected by residual standard error using
the R package drexplorer [47].

PC9-ER9 cells (2 × 106 cells per mouse) were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of female nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Tumors were measured
by caliper twice weekly. Tumor volumes in millimeters
were calculated with the formula (length × width2)/2.
When tumor volumes reached 150 mm3, the mice were
treated with intravenous injections of volasertib (30 mg/
kg/week) and/or oral gavage of erlotinib (30 mg/kg/day).
The control mice were treated with oral gavage of vehicle
control daily and injection of vehicle control weekly. Mice
were humanely killed after 3 weeks of treatment. Pairwise
analysis was used to assess differences among the groups’
treatment responses.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer, and the cell
lysates’ protein concentrations were measured with the
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL) as previously described [35]. Samples containing 50 µg
of protein were separated with 4–20% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked
in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 for 1 h and
then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
The membranes were washed three times and incubated
with specific secondary antibodies for 1 h. Bands were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce Biotechnology). Densitometry quantification of the
bands was performed with the ImageJ software program
(Version 1.48, National Institutes of Health, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue specimens were fixed in formalin-buffer and
embedded in paraffin (FFPE).  From each FFPE sample,
4 microns sections were cut in a microtome and mounted
on charged glass slides.  One section was stained with
hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) for pathology evaluation,
and consecutive sections were stained for IHC with the
following rabbit monoclonal antibodies: Ki67 (Cell
Signaling Technology, clone D2H10, cat. # 9027, dilution
1:400); Cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
clone D3E9, cat. #9579, dilution 1:100). All IHC reactions
were performed in a Leica Bond Max autostainer system
(Leica Biosystems).  Antigen retrieval was performed
with BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (equivalent to
citrate pH6.0, Leica Biosystems).  Bond Polymer Refine
Detection kit (Leica Biosystems) was employed as a
detection system using a modified protocol removing the
post-primary antibody step for the IHC staining of mouse
xenografts in order to avoid background from mouse tissue
IgG.  Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as chromogen
for the visualization of the IHC staining.  The slides are
then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and
coverslipped.  All IHC were performed with the respective
positive controls (human tonsil for Ki67 and cleaved
caspase-3). Additional control slides with positive and
negative cell pellets were employed for cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology, cat. #8104).  All IHC slides
were evaluated for quality control by two pathologists (PV
and JRC).

Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis
NSCLC cell lines were treated with 60 nM
volasertib and/or 2 µM erlotinib for 48 h for cell cycle
analysis or 72 h for apoptosis analysis. For the cell cycle
analysis, a BrdU FITC flow cytometry kit with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For the apoptosis analysis, the cells and the supernatant
were collected, and an APO-BrdU TUNEL Assay kit
(BD Biosciences) was used. Both the cell cycle analysis
and the apoptosis analysis were performed as we described
previously [36].

Comet assay
DNA fragmentation was detected with a comet
assay (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. PC9-ER9 cells at a
concentration of 105 cells/mL were mixed with 1% low
temperature melting agarose at a ratio of 1:9 (v/v). Of
this suspension, 75 µL was spread on a pre-coated slide
and allowed to gel for 15 min at 4°C. The slide was then
gently placed in precooled lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100
mM EDTA, pH 10, 10 mM Tris base, 10% DMSO, 1%
Triton X-100) for 30 min at 4°C. After lysis, the slides
were equilibrated in alkaline solution (300 mM NaOH,

After IHC quality control, all the slides including
H&E, IHC and control slides were scanned in an Aperio
AT2 scanner (Leica Biosystems). IHC scoring was
performed by a pathologist (PV) using Aperio Brightfield
Toolbox image analysis software (Leica Biosystems).  A
nuclear algorithm were applied for the analysis of Ki67 and
cleaved caspase-3. The data were presented as percentage of
tumor cell nuclei positive.  The final data, images and report
were reviewed by two pathologists (PV and JR).

Statistical analysis
The synergistic action of erlotinib and volasertib was
quantified by the Chou-Talalay method using Calcusyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, MA) [48]. The combination
index (CI) of the two drugs, which was based on the
growth inhibition effect of each drug alone or that of their
combination was used to determine whether one drug
had synergism (CI < 1), an additive effect (CI = 1), or
antagonism (CI > 1) with the other.
IC50, IC70, and scaled AUC (area under curve) values
were estimated using the best-fit dose-response model
selected by the residual standard error using drexplorer [48].
AUC (0 for extreme sensitivity, 1 for extreme resistance)
served as a measure of sensitivity reflecting both potency
and total level of inhibition. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to compare sensitivity between different
groups. Spearman rank correlation was used to assess
association between sensitivity and continuous variables.
The animal data included tumor size measurements at
different times. We considered the correlations between the
measurements on the same mouse. We fit this linear model
(with treatment, time effect, and its interaction effect) using
the generalized least squares method. The parameters were
estimated by the maximizing restricted log-likelihood
(REML) method. We used the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) for selecting the best correlation structure. The
analysis was performed using nlme package in R (version
3.1.3). Tukey’s HSD (honest significant difference) test is
used for post-hoc pairwise comparison. The analysis was
performed using nlme and multcomp packages in R (version
3.1.3, https://www.r-project.org/).
For comet assay and IHC staining data one-way
ANOVA is used for comparison in treatment groups. And
post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test is used for pairwise comparison.
