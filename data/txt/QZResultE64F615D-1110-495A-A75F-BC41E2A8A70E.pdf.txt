ABSTRACT
Lapatinib has been used in combination with capecitabine or paclitaxel to
treat patients with progressive HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer
(MBC). Unfortunately, an increased incidence of hepatotoxicity had been reported
in the combinational therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential
mechanisms of this combinational therapy. We found that the patients receiving
lapatinib and paclitaxel treatment showed a higher incidence of hepatobiliary system
disorders than those receiving paclitaxel alone. Lapatinib was shown to increase the
accumulation of doxorubicin in ABCB1-overexpressing hepatocellular cancer cells
and normal liver tissues without altering the protein level of ABCB1. Pharmacokinetic
studies revealed that lapatinib could increase the systematic exposure of paclitaxel
and doxorubicin. Moreover, the in vivo experiments showed that the levels of alanine
aminotransferase and serious hepatocyte injury in the group of lapatinib plus
chemotherapeutic agent were significantly higher than those in the group of single
chemotherapeutic agent such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Our study thus revealed
for the first time that the higher incidence of hepatotoxicity during this combinational
treatment was due to the increased drug accumulation in hepatocytes mediated by
the inhibition of ABCB1 by lapatinib. Appropriate dose adjustment may be needed to
optimize the combination therapy.

INTRODUCTION

MDR [1]. So far, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 have
been found overexpressed in many chemotherapeuticresistant tumors such as colon cancer, liver cancer and
kidney cancer [3]. With a crucial protective role, these
ABC transporters are also expressed at high levels in
intestinal epithelial cells, proximal renal tubular cells,
placental trophoblast cells, the blood brain barrier, and
on the biliary surface of hepatocytes [4, 5]. Under normal
physiological condition, the transporters prevent the
accumulation of xenobiotics and subsequently reducing
toxic effect in various organs [6]. Previously, we showed
that lapatinib inhibited the function of ABC transporters
(including ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2) and enhanced

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a
key role in normal pharmacology, xenobiotic protection,
stem cell maintenance and is involved in the multidrug
resistance (MDR) phenotype of human cancers [1].
They are efflux transporters that actively extrude a wide
variety of chemically unrelated compounds including
anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins and
tanxanes out of cells [2]. P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/MDR1),
multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (ABCC1/
MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/
MXR) are three major ABC transporters associated with

the anticancer activity of chemotherapeutic agents in ABC
transporter-overexpressing cancer cells [7, 8]. In liver,
ABCB1 is expressed at the apical side of bile canaliculus
so that the transporter mediates the hepatic elimination
of xenobiotics and drugs into the bile [9]. To this end,
ABCB1 has been reported to protect again hepatotoxicity
from anticancer drugs such as trabectedin [10]. It follows
that the accumulation of conventional ABC substrate
chemotherapeutic agents in liver may be increased when
the patients were also concomitantly administered with an
ABC transporter inhibitor.
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a major doselimiting adverse effect hindering the clinical application
of many drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) had delayed many drugs approval and withdrawn
approved drugs from the market because of severe
hepatotoxicity, such as bithionol cobalt salts, sulfathiazole
and oxyphenisatin [11]. Liver is the major site of drug
metabolism and detoxification. More than 80% of blood
flow of liver come from the gastrointestinal tract and the
liver has a high capacity for both phase I and phase II
biotransformation [12]. Therefore, liver is vulnerable to
the toxic effect from chemotherapeutic agents. The most
catastrophic consequence is the occurrence of acute liver
failure that leads to death or requires liver transplantation.
In recent years, the combination chemotherapy is the
mainstay treatment option for many cancers. Combination
treatment of lapatinib plus capecitabine or letrozole had
been used in patients with progressive human epidermal
receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast
cancer [13-15]. A phase III study demonstrated that the
combination treatment of lapatinib and capecitabine
significantly decreased the risk of disease progression
compared to either drug alone [16]. However, an increased
hepatobiliary disorders were reported in patients who
received the combination treatment of lapatinib with
paclitaxel, capecitabine or letrozole [17]. Other tyrosine
kinase inhibitors including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib,
gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib have
also been reported to cause hepatotoxicity [18]. The
underlying mechanisms of tyrosine kinase inhibitorsinduced hepatotoxicity in combination treatment have not
been fully elucidated.
In this study, we demonstrated that the increased
incidence of hepatotoxicity during the combination
treatment of lapatinib with paclitaxel was associated with
an increased accumulation of the chemotherapeutic agents.
Data from the in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increased drug accumulation was due to the inhibition
of ABCB1 transport activity by lapatinib. A better
understanding of the mechanism of this hepatotoxicity
may facilitate the further optimization of the combination
regimens composing lapatinib and other chemotherapeutic
drugs in clinic.

RESULTS
A higher incidence of hepatotoxicity was observed
in patients receiving combination therapy of
lapatinib and paclitaxel than those receiving
paclitaxel alone
From a cohort of 39 patients with HER2overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, we analyzed the
adverse events in hepatobiliary system from the start of the
medication until 30 days after the last dose. No patients
suffered any disease of the hepatobiliary system before
receiving the chemotherapy. In the drug combination
group (paclitaxel plus lapatinib), 4 patients experienced
increased ALT and 2 patients experienced increased
AST (Table 1). Most events were grade 1 or 2 according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.
In addition, 4 patients who received the combination
treatment showed hyperbilirubinaemia and one of them
had a Grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia. Furthermore, there
was one patient in the group of lapatinib and paclitaxel
withdrawn from the treatment because of severe abnormal
hepatic function. In contrast, there were only 2 patients in
the group of paclitaxel alone showed grade 1 abnormal
hepatic function. Therefore, the clinical data showed
that the combination therapy (paclitaxel plus lapatinib)
group induced significantly more hepatotoxicity than the
paclitaxel alone treatment group.

Lapatinib increased doxorubicin accumulation in
ABCB1-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma
cells in vitro
We hypothesized that the increased hepatotoxicity
was associated with elevated drug accumulation induced
by lapatinib in the liver. In order to verify our conjecture,
we first investigated the effect of lapatinib on increasing

drug accumulation in a sensitive hepatocellular carcinoma
cells HepG2 and its ABCB1-overexpressing resistant
HepG2/Adr subline. The upregulation of ABCB1
expression in HepG2/Adr cells was shown as Figure 1A.
Lapatinib was found to enhance the cytotoxicity effect
of doxorubicin in HepG2/Adr cells in a concentrationdependent manner but not in the parental HepG2 cells
(Figure 1B). Compared with the parental HepG2 cells, the
intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin or an ABCB1
probe substrate rhodamine 123 in HepG2/Adr cells was
decreased, suggesting that ABCB1 overexpression could
reduce intracellular substrate accumulation (Figure 1). The
fluorescent index of doxorubicin was increased by 1.85, 2.15-, 3.10-fold in HepG2/Adr cell in the presence of
0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 µM of lapatinib, respectively (Figure
1C and E). Similarly, the fluorescent index of rhodamine
123 was increased by 2.23-, 3.21-, 9.77-fold in HepG2/
Adr cell in the presence of 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 µM of
lapatinib, respectively (Figure 1D and 1F). In contrast, the
intracellular accumulations of doxorubicin and rhodamine
123 were not altered in HepG2 cell in the presence of
lapatinib.
Since the increased accumulation effect of lapatinib
can be achieved either by antagonizing the drug efflux
function of ABCB1 or by decreasing the expression level
of ABCB1. We next examined the effect of lapatinib on
the expression of ABCB1 at the mRNA and protein levels
by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. As
shown in Figure 2, ABCB1 RNA and protein expressions
were not significantly altered in HepG2/Adr cells after
treatment with lapatinib for 24, 48 or 72 h. These results
suggested that lapatinib may increase intracellular
accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents by inhibiting
the function of ABCB1 without altering the transporter
expression level.

was increased by 2.64-fold in human liver tissues when
incubated in 2.5 µM lapatinib (Figure 3E). Similarly, the
fluorescent index of doxorubicin was increased by 2.46fold in Swiss mice liver tissues in the presence of 2.5 µM
lapatinib (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results suggest
that lapatinib could increase accumulation of ABCB1
substrate chemotherapeutical agents not only in ABCB1
overexpressing cancer cells but also in normal liver cells.

Lapatinib altered the pharmacokinetics of
paclitaxel and doxorubicin in mice
Co-administration of lapatinib and an anticancer
drug may significantly elevate plasma concentrations of
anticancer drug by interfering with its clearance, which
will increase the unpredictable side effect of the anticancer
drugs [19, 20]. Since lapatinib has been shown to inhibit
ABCB1, we examined the pharmacokinetic property of
paclitaxel and doxorubicin in mice in the presence or
absence of lapatinib. Our data indicated that the lapatinib
plus paclitaxel combination group showed a significantly
longer T1/2β and a greater area under concentration-time
curve (AUC) than those in the paclitaxel alone group
(Figure 4A, Table 2). Moreover, a significantly slower
plasma clearance (CL) was observed in the paclitaxel
plus lapatinib combination group (4.87 mL/h) than in
the paclitaxel alone group (8.35 mL/h) (Table 2). Similar
results were also observed for doxorubicin in the presence
or absence of lapatinib (Figure 4B, Table 2). These findings
indicated that lapatinib could increase the systematic
exposure of ABCB1 substrate chemotherapeutic agents
and may thereby increase the chance of adverse effect (e.g.
hepatotoxicity) from the chemotherapeutic agents.

Lapatinib enhanced doxorubicin accumulation in
normal liver tissues

Combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel/
doxorubicin resulted in elevated hepatotoxicity in
vivo

To further understand the enhancement of
chemotherapeutical agent mediated-hepatotoxicity by
lapatinib, we investigated the effect of lapatinib on
increasing drug accumulation in normal liver tissues
obtained from Swiss mice and cancer patients. We first
detected the expression levels of ABCB1 in human liver
and mouse liver (6 cases for each group). The PCR results
showed that normal human and mice liver both expressed
high levels of ABCB1 (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical
staining confirmed that the normal liver specimens had
high ABCB1 expression and that ABCB1 was localized
on the biliary canalicular surface of hepatocytes and the
apical surface of small biliary ductules (Figure 3B and
3C). Importantly, we found that there was much more
accumulation of doxorubicin in human and mice liver
tissues in the presence of lapatinib than in the absence of
lapatinib (Figure 3E). The fluorescent index of doxorubicin

The Swiss mice model was used to evaluate the
potential hepatotoxic effect of the combination treatment
of lapatinib with paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Result of
various hepatic function markers were summarized in
Table 3. The combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel was
found to increase ALT (P < 0.05) and CRE (P < 0.05)
more significantly than paclitaxel alone. Similarly, the
combination of lapatinib and doxorubicin was found to
elevate BUN and UA more remarkably than doxorubicin
alone. Result from histopathological examination
also revealed that the drug combination caused more
severe cell necrosis and morphological damages than
the chemotherapeutical agent alone (Figure 5). In
the combination groups, morphological evidence of
hepatocyte damage, including presence of parenchymal
acinar transformation zones, vacuolization and hydropic
degeneration of hepatocytes, were observed. Furthermore,

as indicated by the presence of mononuclear cells besides

On the other hand, much milder morphological changes of

observed in patients receiving the combination regimens
in a number of clinical trials, including one conducted
in China with a high incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia
(34.6%) [23]. Hepatic dysfunction is a leading cause of
acute liver failure and it is the major reason for termination
of medicines during their clinical development or early
withdrawal following approval [24, 25]. The mechanisms
causing the increased hepatotoxicity in combination
therapy of lapatinib and paclitaxel are not well defined. In
the present study, we first reported a potential mechanism
of the increased hepatotoxicity via the inhibition of ABC
transporters by lapatinib. Our study indicated that patients
are more vulnerable to drug-induced hepatotoxicity upon
treatment with combination of lapatinib and substrate
drugs of ABC transporters such as paclitaxel and
doxorubicin.
To illustrate the potential mechanism, we found

DISCUSSION
The combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel is an
effective first-line therapy in patients with HER2-positive
metastatic breast cancer [21, 22]. However, it has been
reported that combination of lapatinib and paclitaxel or
capectiabine was associated with a higher incidence
of hepatotoxicity. Abnormal liver function tests were

that lapatinib remarkably increased the accumulation of
doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 in ABCB1-overexpressing
hepatocellular carcinoma cells and normal liver tissues in
concentration-dependent manners. However, lapatinib
did not significantly increase the drug accumulation in
the parental sensitive cells to the anticancer agents. Since
lapatinib did not alter the mRNA and protein expressions
of ABCB1, the elevated drug accumulation of ABCB1
substrate chemotherapeutic drugs must be mediated by
the inhibitory effect of lapatinib on ABCB1 transport
activity [7, 8]. The in vitro drug accumulation assay and
the pharmacokinetic study further confirmed that the
increased hepatotoxicity by the drug combination was
mediated by the increased drug accumulation induced
by lapatinib. As a result, taking our data into account,
the hepatoprotective effects could well be the result
of inhibiting ABCB1 function. As our study showed,
lapatinib would likely exacerbate the hepatotoxic effects
of paclitaxel or doxorubicin rather than reduce them. Our
findings have important implications for the clinical use of
lapatinib in combination with ABCB1 substrate anticancer
drugs. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel, which are commonly
used in treating breast cancer, are all ABCB1 substrates.
Possible drug-drug interactions with lapatinib may occur
and cause severe hepatotoxicity. Therefore, evaluating

genetic polymorphism of ABCB1 in patient before
the commencement of treatment might be considered,
especially when TKIs are included in the combination
regimen, because the likelihood of hepatotoxicity may be
predicted.
Combination chemotherapy of molecular targeted
agents with other cytotoxic anticancer drugs has attracted
a lot of attention recently. Early studies showed that
gefitinib enhanced the anticancer activity of irinotecan
by inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCG2 function, thereby
increasing oral bioavailability and reducing clearance
of topotecan in mice [26, 27]. Co-administration of
lapatinib and irinotecan was also found to increase the
area under the plasma concentration-time curve of SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan and ABCB1
substrate [28]. In a phase III trial of HER2-positive
metastatic breast cancer patients whose cancers had not
responded to trastuzumab or other therapies, superior
therapeutic response were obtained by combination of
lapatinib and capecitabine, compared with capecitabine
alone [29]. Moreover, lapatinib given in combination
with tamoxifen (substrate of ABCB1) was also found to
effectively inhibit cell proliferation and restore tamoxifen
sensitivity in ER-positive and tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer [30]. While lapatinib was also shown to

provide clinical benefit when used in combination with
other anticancer drugs in patients with brain metastasis
breast cancer by promoting drug penetration through
the blood brain barrier [31]. Penetration of taxanes and
vinorelbine across the placenta was known to be regulated
by ABCB1. By inhibiting ABCB1, co-administration
lapatinib and paclitaxel has been shown to obscure the
normal development of the fetal kidney and the regimen
should be avoided during pregnancy [32]. We have
previously demonstrated that lapatinib could reverse the
ABC transporters-mediated MDR by inhibiting the efflux
function of the transporters [7]. Therefore, the adverse
effect from the lapatinib-containing combination regimens

could be due to the inhibition of ABC transporters at
important biological barriers. In fact, the pharmacokinetic
drug-drug interactions related to the combination use of
MDR modulators with other ABC transporter substrate
drugs have been reported [33, 34], which necessitated
dose reduction of the anticancer drugs in order to avoid
adverse effects. Therefore, in this study, we deliberately
set out to investigate the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel
and doxorubicin in the presence or absence of lapatinib. In
human pharmacokinetic studies, the highest peak plasma
lapatinib concentration was roughly 3 µM and the halflife was approximately 17 h with achievement of steadystate concentration after six to seven days of once-daily

Figure 6: Schematic illustration of the mechanism of lapatinib promoting the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic
agent in liver. Lapatinib can interfere with the distribution of agent and increase the plasma concentration. In hepatocytes, the

chemotherapeutic agent is excreted out of the cells by ABC transporters (mainly ABCB1). Lapatinib inhibits the function of ABCB1 and
elevates the concentration of chemotherapeutic agent in hepatocytes. Consequently, the hepatocytes develop into apoptosis or necrosis and
the hepatic function is disordered.

dosing [35, 36]. Therefore, the concentrations of lapatinib
investigated in our in vitro experiments are clinically
relevant. Our result proved that lapatinib significantly
increased the exposure level of paclitaxel and doxorubicin
in mice (Table 3). These suggest pharmacokinetics of
conventional chemotherapeutic agent may be altered in
the presence of lapatinib.
In the in vivo animal study, the hepatotoxicity
marker (ALT) was found to be much more remarkable
upregulated after treatment with the drug combination
(lapatinib and paclitaxel) than the individual drug alone.
The observed increased serum ALT is almost always a
consequence of release by dead or dying hepatocytes, and
is a sensitive semi-quantitative measure of liver injury.
Serum ALT elevations can identify hepatocyte injury or
necrosis, which can be transient, as the liver adapts to
repair toxic injury. This compensation action in the liver
could explain why the ALT level in group of lapatinib
and doxorubicin was not raised. From the above we can
conclude that the treatment of lapatinib plus paclitaxel
or doxorubicin could cause a severe liver injury than
the single-agent treatment. Hepatotoxicity induced by
lapatinib-containing combination was further confirmed by
histopathological examination of liver tissue specimens.
The histopathological evaluations demonstrated hydropic
degeneration, vacuolated hepatocytes, portal inflammation
and additionally apoptotic cells and lobular focal necrosis
with extended exposure in the combination group of
lapatinib and paclitaxel or doxorubicin. In addition, we
observed a serious sinusoidal injury and hyperemia in
the combination treatment group. These pathological
changes are consistent with the cytotoxic effects induced
by paclitaxel and doxorubicin. The morphology of the
liver injury induced by doxorubicin is related to the
hydropic degeneration, hemorrhage, heavy centrilobular
spotting and extensive depletion in glycogen while the
morphological changes in liver induced by paclitaxel
are inflammatory cell infiltrates and foci, sinusoidal
expansion, vesicular degeneration, and necrotic cells [37,
38]. However, all of these features were absent from livers
of mice receiving monotherapy (paclitaxel or doxorubicin)
treatment at the dose tested. These results indicated that
lapatinib could exacerbate the liver injury induced by
paclitaxel and doxorubicin. It has been reported that
doxorubicin and paclitaxel could damage rat liver by
inducing oxidative stress [39]. Further studies are needed
to evaluate whether lapatinib could enhance the effects of
paclitaxel and doxorubicin through promoting oxidative
stress.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated
for the first time the hepatotoxicity caused by the coadministration of lapatinib and paclitaxel/doxorubicin by
both biochemical and histopathological evaluation. We
showed that lapatinib can increase the accumulation of
chemotherapeutic agents especially ABCB1 substrates in
liver to give rise to the higher incidence of hepatotoxicity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 6). Given that ABC transporters are also highly
expressed in many normal organs such as liver, colon,
kidney and brain, dose adjustment of the concomitantly
administered chemotherapeutic drugs is needed to avoid
adverse events including hepatotoxicity in combination
regiment involving ABC transporter inhibitor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Doxorubicin (Dox), paclitaxel, verapamil,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-yl)-2,5- diphenyllapatinibrazolium
bromide (MTT) and rhodamine 123 (Rho 123) were
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Lapatinib was purchased from LC laboratories
(Woburn, MA, USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) were products of Gibco BRL (Grand
Island, NY, USA). Monoclonal antibodies against ABCB1
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). Other routine laboratory reagents were
of analytical grade obtained from various commercial
sources (Guangzhou, China).

Cell lines and cell culture
The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). The Dox-selected derivative ABCB1overexpressing HepG2/Adr subline was established as
previous study [40]. All cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
mL streptomycin sulfate and 100 units/mL penicillin G
sulfate, and maintained at 37oC in the presence of 5%
CO2. HepG2/Adr cells were cultured with 1.2 μM Dox to
maintain its ABCB1-overexpressing properties [40]. All
cells were grown in drug-free culture medium for more
than 2 weeks before assay.

Patients
The medical history of a total of 39 patients with
HER2-overexpressing MBC (March 2006 - October
2008) were retrieved from the database archive of the
Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) for analysis.
All patients were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
by histological examination. The HER2 overexpression
was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 18
patients received the combination treatment (lapatinib
1500 mg daily plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 every 3 days) and
the control group received only paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 every
3 days). The median age is 50.5 years (age range from 21
to 65 years).

of lapatinib at 37°C for 1 h in the medium, and then 10
µM doxorubicin was added to the medium and further
incubated for 6 h. Subsequently, the tissues were then
collected, centrifuged and washed twice with cold PBS
containing 10 μM verapamil. Then, liver tissues were
resuspended in 1 ml/100 mg tissues lysis solution which
contained 0.3 mol/l HCl and 60% ethanol (1:1) and was
homogenized at 4°C and then centrifuged at 12 000 × g
[43]. The supernatant was removed and its fluorescence
signal was measured by a spectrofluorometer at λex 470
nm and λem 590 nm. Simultaneously, the standard curve
of doxorubicin was made with the same condition. The
doxorubicin accumulation in liver tissues (μg/g) was
calculated according to the fluorescence value using a
standard curve.

The HepG2 and HepG2/Adr cells were exposed
to different concentrations of lapatinib (0.625, 1.25, 2.5
and 10 μM) for different periods (0, 24, 48 and 72 h) to
test whether lapatinib affected the expression of ABCB1.
Western blot analysis was conducted as previously
described [7]. After being incubated in blocking solution
containing 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer (10 mM TrisHCL (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2
h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with
primary antibody ABCB1 (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and GAPDH (1:5000 dilution, Kangcheng
Biotechnology). The membranes were then incubated for
2 h with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000
dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by
the enhanced Phototope TM-HRP Detection Kit (Cell
Signaling, USA) and exposed to Kodak medical X-ray
processor (Carestream Health, USA). Protein expression
was quantified by Scion Image software (Scion Co, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for ABCB1
expression was performed using a standard twostep method [44]. The tissues were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 24 h.
After fixation, the tissues were embedded in paraffin
wax. The paraffin tissues were sliced into 14 μM sections
and mounted onto glass slides. After dewaxing, antigen
retrieval was facilitated in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0)
and the tissue sections were then incubated with primary
antibodies against ABCB1 (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for overnight at 4°C. Then the slides
were washed three times with PBS and subsequently
incubated with second antibodies and stained with
3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB). Finally,
the slides were counter stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin.
Slides immunoreacted with only second antibodies
provided the background staining for comparison. All
slides were examined with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope
and images were captured with NIS-Elements F 3.2
imaging analysis system.

Cytotoxicity
We collected the cells and seeded them at a density
of 3.0 × 103 cells per well in 96-well plates. After 24
h, different concentrations of doxorubicin were added
into the wells 1 h after lapatinib was added. After 68 h,
MTT (5 mg/mL, 20 μL) was added into each well and
cultured for another 4 h. Then the medium was discarded
and each well was added with 120 μL DMSO. Finally,
optical density was measured at 540 nm with background
subtraction at 670 nm by Model 550 Microplate Reader
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Doxorubicin and rhodamine 123 accumulation
The accumulation of doxorubicin or rhodamine
123 in HepG2 and HepG2/Adr cells was measured as
previously described [41]. Verapamil, a known ABCB1
inhibitor, was used as a positive control [42].

Swiss mice hepatotoxicity model
Swiss mice, 5 - 6 weeks of age and weighing about
20 g, were obtained from the Center of Experimental
Animals, Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China)
and were randomized into six treatment groups: (1) saline
(on day 1 and 2 of every week for 2 weeks); (2) lapatinib
alone (on day 1 and 2 of every week for 2 weeks, p.o.,
100 mg/kg); (3) paclitaxel alone (on day 2 of every week
for 2 weeks, i.v., 18 mg/kg); (4) paclitaxel (i.v., 18 mg/
kg) one hour after lapatinib on day 2 of every week, (5)
doxorubicin alone (every three days for 2 weeks, i.v.,
10 mg/kg); (6) doxorubicin (i.v., 10 mg/kg) one hour
after lapatinib (p.o., 100 mg/kg) every three days. The
experimental animals had free access to sterilized food
and water. Liver function was evaluated by measuring

Ex vivo evaluation of doxorubicin accumulation in
patient liver tissues
The fresh normal liver tissue adjacent to the
hepatocellular carcinoma retrieved from Sun Yatsen university cancer center was used for the drug
accumulation assay ex vivo. Informed consent was
obtained from the patients before tissue collection. The
work was approved by the ethics review committee at Sun
Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Liver tissues of
50-100 mg were cut into small pieces (1mm3) and cultured
in DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum at 37°C.
The tissues were incubated with the desired concentration

the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, albumin and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). After 2
weeks, all mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation
and unprocessed blood and tissues samples were quickly
obtained from the mice. Liver tissues specimens were
fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin
blocks. Sectioned slices were stained with haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), and each section was analyzed at 200
and 400·magnification by Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope.
All of the pathological slides were independently and
blindly evaluated by two pathologists (Dr Shixun Lu and
Dr Rongzhen Luo) from the department of pathology
of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. All animal
care and experimental procedures were approved by the
Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation and were
carried out in accordance with the guidelines on animal
care and experiments of laboratory animals (Center of
Experimental Animals, Sun Yat-sen University, China).

Total cellular RNA was isolated by Trizol
Reagent (Gibco BRL, USA) RNA extraction kit
following manufacture instruction. cDNA were
prepared from the sensitive HepG2 and the resistant
HepG2/Adr cells. Reverse transcription was done with
reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).
Oligonucleotides primers for ABCB1 and GAPDH were
synthesized commercially (Invitrogen Co., China).
They included ABCB1 (homo sapiens), sense primer,
5’-CCCATCATTGCAATAGCAGG-3’, antisense primer,
5’-GTTCAAACTTCTGCTCCTGA-3’; Abcb1 (mus),
sense primer, 5’-CCCATGGCTGCATCAGTGTT-3’,
antisense primer, 5’-GCTGAGTGCCTTTGTCTCCT-3’;
GAPDH,
sense
primer,
5’GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3’, antisense primer,
5’-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3’. Regular PCR
was performed at 94°C for 2 min for initial denaturation,
and then at 94°C for 30 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds,
and 72°C for 1 min using the GeneAmp PCR system 9700
(PE Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). After 35 cycles
of amplification, additional extensions were done at 72°C
for 10 min. Products were resolved and examined by 1%
agarose gel electrophoresis [45]. For qRT-PCR analysis,
the reaction was carried out at 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 5
min and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s. Relative
quantification of ABCB1 was performed using the 2-ΔΔCt
method [46]. All experiments were repeated three times.

Pharmacokinetic study in NIH mice
Male and female NIH mice weighing 20-23 g
were obtained from the Center of Experimental Animals,
Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) for the
pharmacokinetic study. The mice were randomly divided
into four groups (paclitaxel alone, doxorubicin alone and
their combination with lapatinib), each of which consisted
of 6 mice (three males and three females). For plasma
paclitaxel levels, mice were treated with either 100 mg/
kg of lapatinib (p.o.) or vehicle on days 1 and 2 and on
day 2 all mice were injected with 18 mg/kg of paclitaxel
(10 mL/kg) via the caudal vein one hour after lapatinib or
vehicle. For plasma doxorubicin levels, mice were treated
with either 100 mg/kg of lapatinib (p.o.) or vehicle on
days 1 and 2 and on day 2 all mice were injected with 10
mg/kg of doxorubicin (10 mL/kg) via the caudal vein one
hour after lapatinib or vehicle. Blood was collected from
the retro-orbital plexus at designated time points and they
were kept in cold heparin coated glass tubes. The blood
from 1 male and 1 female was pooled and plasma was
isolated and stored at -80°C until analysis. The plasma
levels of paclitaxel and doxorubicin were analyzed by
HPLC as previously described (20). Pharmacokinetic
parameters was determined from the concentration-time
data by non compartment model using the 3P97 software
(Practical Pharmacokinetics Software, Beijing, China).
All experiments were approved by Ethics Committee
for Animal Experiments and carried out in accordance
with the guidelines on Animal Care and Experiments of
Laboratory Animals of Center of Experimental Animals,
Sun Yat-sen University.

Statistical analysis
The Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate
the statistical significance in clinical data. In all other
experiments, statistical significance was determined at P
< 0.01 (**) or P < 0.05 (*) by the Student’s t-test. The data
was expressed as means ± standard deviation.
