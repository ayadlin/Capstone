Abstract
IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) has been shown to suppress
tumor development at least partly through regulating apoptosis of tumor cells; however, the molecular mechanisms
underlying IRF8 regulation of apoptosis are still not fully
understood. Here, we showed that disrupting IRF8 function
resulted in inhibition of cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and
caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. Inhibition of the
mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis signaling cascade is
apparently due to blockage of caspase-8 and Bid activation.
Analysis of signaling events upstream of caspase-8 revealed
that disrupting IRF8 function dramatically increases FLIP
mRNA stability, resulting in increased IRF8 protein level.
Furthermore, primary myeloid cells isolated from IRF8-null
mice also exhibited increased FLIP protein level, suggesting
that IRF8 might be a general repressor of FLIP. Nuclear IRF8
protein was absent in 92% (55 of 60) of human STS specimens,
and 99% (59 of 60) of human STS specimens exhibited FLIP
expression, suggesting that the nuclear IRF8 protein level is
inversely correlated with FLIP level in vivo. Silencing FLIP
expression significantly increased human sarcoma cells to
both FasL-induced and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis, and ectopic
expression of IRF8 also significantly increased the sensitivity
of these human sarcoma cells to FasL- and TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that IRF8
mediates FLIP expression level to regulate apoptosis and
targeting IRF8 expression is a potentially effective therapeutic
strategy to sensitize apoptosis-resistant human STS to
apoptosis, thereby possibly overcoming chemoresistance of
STS, currently a major obstacle in human STS therapy. [Cancer

Introduction
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of
mesenchymal malignancies. One of the most prominent characteristics of human STS is their resistance to apoptosis (1).
Because the vast majority of cytotoxic modalities exert their

antitumor effects by inducing tumor cell apoptosis, resistance to
apoptosis is one of the most significant challenges in sarcoma
chemotherapy. Consequently, identifying factors that regulate the
antiapoptotic phenotype and elucidating the underlying molecular
mechanisms of these apoptosis regulatory factors are crucial for
the success of molecular target-based therapeutics for human
sarcoma.
IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF8; also known as IFN consensus
sequence-binding protein) is a transcription factor of the IFN
regulatory factor family (2, 3). Mice with a null mutation of IRF8
exhibit two prominent phenotypes (4). The first is impaired
immunity against virus infections. The second is deregulated
hematopoiesis leading to development of a disease reminiscent of
human chronic myelogeneous leukemia. One of the important
features of these IRF8-deficient myeloid cells is their increased
resistance to apoptosis (4, 5). In humans, IRF8 expression is high in
normal hematopoietic cells but impaired in myeloid leukemia (6).
Recently, we have shown that IRF8 may also play a role as a tumor
suppressor in nonhematopoietic (solid) tumors. Loss of IRF8
expression was observed in human carcinoma cells when
compared with matched primary tumor cells (7, 8). We further
showed that loss of IRF8 expression or function significantly
enhanced the metastatic potential of sarcoma cells in mouse
models of experimental lung metastasis (8, 9). IRF8 tumor
suppression function has also been shown in lens, colon,
esophageal, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (10, 11). More
recently, it has been revealed that the chromosome region
containing IRF8 gene is frequently deleted in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells, which is a characteristic of a tumor suppressor
gene (11).
The molecular mechanisms underlying IRF8 modulation of
apoptosis are not fully understood and are possibly tumor type or
tumor differentiation stage specific. Ectopic expression of IRF8 was
shown to repress Bcl-xL expression in human monocytic leukemia
cells (5). However, ectopic expression of IRF8 resulted in decreased
Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL expression in mouse myeloid leukemia cells
(12). It has also been shown that a decreased nuclear IRF8 protein
level correlates with increased Bcl-2 protein level in splenocytes of
leukemia-bearing 12/15-lipoxygenase (Alox15)–deficient mice (13).
Moreover, it has recently been shown that IRF8 also mediates Fasmediated apoptosis via regulating Fap-1 expression in monocytic
leukemia cells (14). In addition, disruption of IRF8 function in
human monocytic leukemia cells resulted in inhibition of
activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
(STAT1), a key mediator in the IFN-g signaling pathway that is

essential for Fas activation and Fas-mediated apoptosis (15). We
have recently shown that loss of IRF8 expression or function
diminishes mouse sarcoma cell sensitivity to apoptosis induction
(16) and IRF8 mediates IFN-g–sensitized and Fas-mediated
apoptosis by participating in STAT1 activation and Fas receptor
expression in sarcoma cells (16). Taken together, it is clear that IRF8
regulates death receptor–initiated and mitochondrion-dependent
apoptosis pathways in tumor cells, but it is not clear whether IRF8
mediates multiple apoptosis-related genes in the same tumor cells
or different target genes of the same apoptosis pathway in different
types of tumor cells. In the present study, we carried out a detailed
analysis of the mechanistic link between IRF8 and the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis pathway in mouse sarcoma cells and
primary myeloid cells, identifying FLIP, a key regulator of the death
receptor–initiated apoptosis pathways, as a target of IRF8.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines. The mouse sarcoma cell line CMS4 was kindly
provided by Dr. A. Deleo (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). The
human sarcoma cell line HT1080 was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. CMS4 cells were transfected with pcDNA vector control
plasmid or pcDNA containing a mouse IRF8 mutant as previously
described (16).
Tumor specimens and immunohistochemistry. Human STS specimens were collected from surgical specimens at The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. For immunohistochemical staining of IRF8
protein, tissues were fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections
were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and printed on
glass slides as a tissue microarray. Specimens were blocked with normal
goat serum (1.5%) and then incubated with a goat anti-IRF8 polyclonal
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100 dilution or rabbit anti-FLIP
polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at 1:100 dilution for 30 min, followed by
rinsing and staining with anti-goat or anti-rabbit biotinylated antibody
(1:2,000) for another 30 min. Color was developed by incubation with 3,3¶diaminobenzidine solution (Sigma), followed by rinsing and counterstaining
with hematoxylin.
Cell surface marker analysis. For cell surface tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor (DR4 and DR5)
measurement, tumor cells were stained with FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-human DR4 and DR5 monoclonal antibodies (mAb; Alexis Biochemicals), respectively, or with isotype-matched control for 30 min and then
washed thrice in PBS. The stained cells were then analyzed by flow
cytometry FACSCalibur with CellQuest (BD Biosciences).
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis was carried out as previously described (17). The
PCR primer sequences are as follows: IRF8, 5¶-CCAGATTTTGAGGAAGTGACG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGGGAGAATGCTGAATGGTGC-3¶ (reverse);
short form of human FLIP (hFLIPs), 5¶-CGAGGCAAGATAAGCAAGGA-3¶
( forward) and 5¶-CACATGGAACAATTTCCAAGAA-3¶ (reverse); short form
of mouse FLIP (mFLIPs), 5¶-TCCACAGAGTGAGGCGGTTTGAC-3¶ ( forward)
and 5¶-TCATGCTGGTACTCCAT-3¶ (reverse); and h-actin, 5¶-ATTGTTACCAACTGGGACGACATG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-CTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTC-3¶ (reverse). PCR products were visualized on 1% to 2% agarose
gel under UV light. Image was acquired by ImageQuant 300 with IQuest
Capture 300 software (GE).
FLIP mRNA half-life measurement. Tumor cells were seeded in six-well
plates overnight. Actinomycin D (Invitrogen) was added to a final
concentration of 10 Ag/mL. Total RNA was isolated from the treated cells
at different time points. RT-PCR was then used to analyze FLIPs and h-actin
mRNA levels. The PCR band intensity was quantified using NIH ImageJ
program (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The ratio of FLIPs versus h-actin was
determined for each time point. The value of untreated cells was set at
100%. The FLIPs mRNA half-life is defined as the time when 50% of the
FLIPs mRNA has degraded after actinomycin D treatment.

(Cyt C ) release assay. Tumor cells were treated with IFN-g overnight, followed by
incubation with recombinant FasL for 4 h. Cytosol (C ) and organelle-enriched
mitochondrion (M ) fractions were then prepared. The fractions were analyzed
by Western blotting analysis for cytochrome c and Apaf-1 protein levels. The
blots of cytosol fractions were stripped and reprobed with anti-mouse h-actin
antibody. B, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. Tumor cells were treated with
IFN-g overnight, followed by incubation with recombinant FasL for various
times as indicated. Cytosolic fractions were then prepared and analyzed for
activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as cleaved PARP. The blots were
stripped and reprobed with anti-mouse h-actin antibody.

Preparation of bone marrow–derived myeloid cells. Mouse bone
marrow–derived dendritic cells were generated from marrow stem cells
obtained from the femurs of IRF8-null mice and wild-type (wt) littermate
control mice as described previously (18).
Preparation of cytosol and organelle-enriched mitochondrion
fractions. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold cytosol extraction buffer
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/L sucrose, 70 mmol/L KCl,
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 0.01% digitonin,
protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem)] for 5 min on ice (1 
106 cells/25 AL buffer). The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1,000 
g for 5 min in 4jC. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and
centrifuged at 20,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The supernatant was then
collected as cytosol fraction. To isolate the mitochondrial fraction, the pellet
from the first centrifuge was rinsed once with PBS and then resuspended in
the same volume (1  106 cells/25 AL buffer) of ice-cold mitochondrion lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
2 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, and protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem)] for 10 min on ice, followed
by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as
organelle-enriched mitochondrion fraction.
Fas DISC isolation. Biotin-anti-mouse Fas mAb (clone Jo2, BD
Biosciences) and isotype-matched IgG control mAb were incubated with
Streptavidin T1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen). The antibody-conjugated beads
were then incubated with IFN-g–treated tumor cells for 10 min at room

temperature. Bead-bound cells were collected using a magnetic stand and
lysed on ice for 30 min. The beads were washed five times in PBS plus 0.1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA). The bead-bound proteins were eluted by
resuspending the washed beads in SDS-protein gel loading buffer and
heating at 95jC for 5 min. The eluted proteins were resolved by 4% to 20%
SDS-PAGE gradient gels and analyzed by Western blotting analysis.
Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis was carried out as
previously described (19). The blots were probed with the following primary
antibodies: anti-IRF8 antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200
( for tumor cells) or 1:1,000 ( for myeloid cells) dilution, anti-FLIP antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000 for human FLIP or anti-FLIP (Cell
Signaling) at 1:1,000 for mouse FLIP, anti-cytochrome c (BD Biosciences) at
1:500, anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling) at 1:1,000, anti-cleaved
caspase-9 (Cell Signaling) at 1:1,000, anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling) at 1:1,000, anti-cleaved caspase-8 (R&D
Systems) at 0.5 Ag/mL, anti-tBid (Millipore) at 1:200, and anti-h-actin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000 for human h-actin or anti-h-actin (Sigma) at
1:5,000 for mouse h-actin. Blots were detected using the enhanced
chemiluminescence Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Super Signaling (Pierce) Western detection kit.
RNA interference of FLIP. FLIP-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
were designed and synthesized by Qiagen. Four different siRNA duplexes,
recognizing the conserved region of both FLIPL and FLIPs, were tested in
HT1080 cells for their effectiveness to silence FLIP expression. The most
effective siRNA (5¶-CACCTTGTTTCGGACTATAGA-3¶) was used for silenc-

ing FLIP expression in HT1080 cells. A scramble siRNA (5¶-ATAGCGACTAAACACATCAA-3¶) was obtained from Dharmacon and used as control.
Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol for
30 min. The fixed cells were washed in PBS and incubated with DNA
extraction buffer [192 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 4 mmol/L citric acid (pH 7.8)] for
5 min. RNase A and propidium iodide (PI) were added to the cells and
incubated for 30 min. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Measurement of apoptotic cell death. Apoptotic cell death was
measured by PI staining as previously described (19). Briefly, tumor cells
were seeded in six-well culture plates (1  105 per well) and cultured in the
presence or absence of recombinant human FasL or TRAIL (PeproTech).
Adherent and suspended cells were then harvested and incubated with PI
solution (Trevigen) for 5 min at room temperature and then immediately
analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cell death was calculated by
the following formula: % cell death = % PI-positive cells after FasL or TRAIL
treatment % PI-positive cells without FasL or TRAIL treatment.

Results

apoptosis through regulating target genes in the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway. Because release of cytochrome c is the
initial step of the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis pathway,
we first measured cytochrome c release by Western blotting
analysis. Constitutive cytochrome c is detectable in the cytosol
fractions of untreated CMS4 and CMS4. Vecttor cells, albeit at
low levels, and IFN-g treatment alone did not alter the cytochrome c
release rate (Fig. 1A). FasL treatment dramatically increased the
cytochrome c levels in both CMS4 and CMS4.Vector cells. In
contrast, no constitutive or FasL-induced cytochrome c release was
detected in CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 1A).
One of the consequences of cytochrome c release is formation of
apoptosome containing cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 in
the cytosol of the cells, leading to activation of caspase-9 through
an intrinsic autocatalytic cleavage of procaspase-9 (20). Western
blotting analysis revealed that Apaf-1 is located in both the

mitochondrion and cytosol fractions (Fig. 1A), and its expression
level is not altered in CMS4.K79E cells. Caspase-9 is activated by
FasL in both CMS4 and CMS4.Vector cells but not in CMS4.K79E
cells. Consistent with caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation
and PARP cleavage are also inhibited in CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 1B).
Taken together, our data suggest that IRF8 function is required for
cytochrome c release and for cytochrome c–mediated caspase
activation in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Disruption of IRF8 function leads to inhibition of caspase8 activation. Cytochrome c release is mediated by activated Bid in
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and activation of Bid by death
receptor–initiated signals requires cleavage by activated caspase8 (21). Our above observation that FasL-induced cytochrome c release
is inhibited in CMS4.K79E cells suggests that caspase-8 activation
might be blocked by loss of IRF8 function. To test this hypothesis,
IFN-g–treated tumor cells were incubated with oligomerized Fas

agonist mAb to induce death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
formation and to activate the Fas-mediated apoptosis signaling
pathway. The immunoprecipitated Fas DISCs were then analyzed by
Western blotting using caspase-8–specific and Fas-specific antibodies, respectively. It is clear that cross-linking the Fas receptor
activated caspase-8 in the DISC in CMS4 and CMS4.Vector. The level
of Fas DISC-associated procaspase-8 is much less in CMS4.K79E cells
than in CMS4 and CMS4.Vector cells. Caspase-8 activation is not
detected in CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 2A). Initial attempts failed to
detect FLIP in the Fas DISC in all three cell sublines (data not
shown). To further determine the effect of loss of IRF8 function on
caspase-8 activation, cultured tumor cells were sensitized with IFNg, followed by incubation with FasL. Cytosol and mitochondrion
fractions were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting analysis
using a caspase-8–specific antibody. A cleaved form of caspase8 with a molecular weight of f25 kDa was detected in CMS4 and
CMS4.Vector cells (Fig. 2B ). However, this cleaved form
of caspase-8 was not detected in CMS4.K79E cells. Reproducible
results were obtained with three different anti-active mouse
caspase-8 antibodies (data not shown). No procaspase-8 protein
was detected in the mitochondrion fraction (data not shown).
Although IFN-g can sensitize CMS4 cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis,
IFN-g treatment did not alter the procaspase-8 protein level
(Fig. 2B). Therefore, we conclude that IRF8 mediates cytochrome c
release via regulation of caspase-8 activation in sarcoma cells.
One of the direct downstream targets of activated caspase-8 in
the apoptosis pathway is Bid. Next, we examined the effect of loss
of IRF8 function on Bid activation in the tumor cells. Tumor cells
were sensitized with IFN-g, followed by incubation with FasL.
Cytosol and mitochondrion fractions were prepared and analyzed
by Western blotting analysis using an antibody that is specific for
mouse cleaved Bid (tBid). FasL treatment induced tBid formation
in the cytosol fractions of CMS4 and CMS4.Vector cells but not in
CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 2C). Bid and tBid proteins were not detected
in the mitochondrion fractions of the three tumor cell sublines
(data not shown).
IRF8 mediates caspase-8 activation through regulation of
FLIP expression. Engagement of the death receptor Fas by its ligand
recruits FADD and procaspase-8 to the death receptor cytoplasmic
domain to form the DISC, leading to autocatalytic cleavage of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

procaspase-8 to activate caspase-8 (22, 23). It has also been shown
that FLIP can bind to FADD in the DISC to inhibit caspase8 activation (24). In light of the above observations, we next sought to
determine whether caspase-8 activation is regulated by IRF8
through FLIP in sarcoma cells. We observed that the long form of
FLIP (FLIPL) is expressed in all three cell lines (Fig. 3A). The FLIPs is
weakly detectable in the cytosol fractions of CMS4 and CMS4.Vector
cells. In contrast, FLIPs protein level is much higher in the cytosol
of CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 3A). To determine whether IRF8 mediates
the stability of FLIPs mRNA, CMS4.Vector and CMS4.K79E cells
were incubated in the presence of actinomycin D and FLIPs mRNA
levels were analyzed at different time points after actinomycin D
treatment. The half-life of FLIPs mRNA is f3 hours in CMS4.Vector
cells and f12 hours in CMS4.K79E cells, respectively (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that IRF8 increases FLIPs protein level at least partly
through stabilizing FLIPs mRNA in CMS4.K79E cells.
To further validate the role of FLIP in regulation of caspase8 activation and apoptosis, we carried out a proof-of-concept study.
CMS4 cells were stably transfected with the viral form of FLIP
(vFLIP; ref. 25). Western blotting analysis revealed that ectopic
expression of vFLIP blocked FasL-induced caspase-8 activation in
CMS4 tumor cells (Fig. 3C). As expected, ectopic expression of
vFLIP also significantly decreased the tumor cell sensitivity to Fasmediated apoptosis (P < 0.01; Fig. 3C).
To determine whether IRF8 is a general regulator of FLIP, we
isolated primary myeloid cells from IRF8-null mice and wt control
mice. Myeloid cells were chosen because they are a model primary
cell for studying IRF8 function (26–28). Western blotting analysis
revealed that FLIPs is undetectable in the cytosol fraction and
FLIPL is weakly detectable in the mitochondrion fraction (Fig. 3D).
Knocking out IRF8 expression dramatically increases FLIPL protein
levels (Fig. 3D).
IRF8 protein level is inversely correlated with FLIP protein
level in high-grade human STS specimens. Our above observations suggest that IRF8 and FLIP are key determinants of the
intrinsic apoptosis pathways in sarcoma cells. Consequently, we
sought to examine IRF8 and FLIP protein levels in human STS
specimens in a cohort of high-grade pleiomorphic STS malignant
fibrous histiocytoma specimens. A tissue microarray block
consisting of tumor sections derived from 60 high-grade human

IRF8, whereas 58 of the 60 (97%) exhibited no nuclear IRF8 protein
but cytoplasmic IRF8 protein at varying levels of intensity: low = 21,
moderate to high = 37; distribution: <50% of tumor cells in 4, 50%
to 79% in 34, and z80 in 20; 2 specimens exhibited no IRF8
expression. As a positive control, normal human tonsil tissue was
observed to express high levels of nuclear IRF8 protein (Fig. 4A).
These observations suggest that IRF8 protein is largely absent in
the nuclei of human STS cells. Interestingly, a subset of cells in the
STS microenvironment, defined by a STS specialist (A.L.) as
lymphocytes, exhibited high nuclear IRF8 (Fig. 4Ac). Studies to
evaluate the role of nuclear IRF8 expression in STS-associated
normal cells are currently ongoing.
FLIP protein was detected in 59 of the 60 human STS specimens
(98%; Fig. 4B; intensity: low = 46, moderate to high = 13;
distribution: <50% of tumor cells = 17, 50–79% = 21, and z80% =
21). Only one tumor (2%) exhibited no FLIP expression. These
results suggest an inverse correlation between nuclear IRF8 protein
level and FLIP protein level in high-grade human STS specimens.
Silencing FLIP expression increased human sarcoma cell
sensitivity to FasL- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The presence

of FLIP protein in the vast majority of human STS specimens
suggests that FLIP might be responsible at least partly for the
apoptosis-resistant phenotype in human STS (29). We next sought
to silence FLIP expression and examined the effect of loss of FLIP
expression on the tumor cell sensitivity to apoptosis. Two cell
death detection methods were first compared for their sensitivity
in detecting dead cells. In the first method, untreated and FasLtreated tumor cells were stained directly with PI and analyzed by
flow cytometry. In the second method, tumor cells were analyzed
for cell cycle status based on the DNA content of the cells.
Apoptotic or dead cells are defined as cells in the sub-G0-G1
population. Because we measure the cell death at the late stage, the
sub-G0-G1 cell population in the cell cycle analysis is actually a
mixture of apoptotic and dead cells (Fig. 5A). Figure 5A indicates
that these two methods exhibit very similar sensitivity (Fig. 5A).
Therefore, we used the economic PI direct staining method to
detect FasL- and TRAIL-induced cell death. Next, four siRNA
sequences were chosen from the conserved region of FLIPL and
FLIPs. Human sarcoma HT1080 cells were transiently transfected
with these four siRNAs and a scramble siRNA. Among the four
siRNAs, only one siRNA effectively silenced FLIP expression
(Fig. 5B). HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with scramble
siRNA and the FLIP-specific siRNA, respectively, and the tumor
cells were then analyzed for apoptosis. It is clear that silencing
FLIP expression significantly increased the tumor cell sensitivity to
both FasL- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis (P < 0.01; Fig. 5B).
Ectopic expression of IRF8 increased the efficacy of TRAILand FasL-induced apoptosis in human STS cells. The observations that FLIP protein is present in the vast majority of human
STS cells suggest that therapeutic agents that kill tumor cells by
inducing cell death are possibly not going to be effective in the
clinic. It has been shown that suppression of FLIP expression by
therapeutic agents can increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to
death induction (30, 31). Because our data suggest that IRF8 is a
key regulator of FLIP, we reasoned that restoring IRF8 expression
could possibly sensitize the human sarcoma tumor cells to
apoptosis, including FasL- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To test
this hypothesis, we transfected human sarcoma cells to stably
express IRF8 (Fig. 6A). Analysis of FLIP mRNA and protein levels in
the transfected cells indicated that ectopic expression of IRF8
dramatically decreased FLIP transcript as well as protein levels in
HT1080 cells (Fig. 6A). Next, HT1080, HT1080.Vector, and
HT1080.IRF8 cells were treated with various concentrations of
recombinant FasL or TRAIL protein, and apoptosis was then
analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, FasL and TRAIL induced cell
death in HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic
expression of IRF8 significantly increased FasL-induced apoptotic
cell death compared with HT1080 and HT1080.Vector cells at all
FasL concentrations tested (P < 0.01; Fig. 6B). Ectopic expression of
IRF8 also significantly increased TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell
death compared with HT1080 and HT1080.Vector cells at all TRAIL
concentrations (P < 0.01) except at concentration of 5 ng/mL
(Fig. 6C). Analysis of cell death kinetics revealed that FasL- and
TRAIL-induced cell death reached highest rate at approximately 12
to18 hours, respectively (Fig. 6B and C). To determine whether
IRF8-enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis can possibly be attributed to an IRF8-regulated increase in the expression of TRAIL
receptors DR4 and DR5, we analyzed cell surface DR4 and DR5
expression levels and observed no difference in DR4 and DR5
expression level between control and IRF8-expressing HT1080 cells
(Fig. 6D). Taken together, our results suggest that targeting IRF8

expression in human sarcoma tumor is a potentially effective
strategy to increase the efficacy of therapeutic agents (e.g., TRAIL)
and perhaps thereby overcome human sarcoma chemoresistance.

Discussion
IRF8 is a transcription factor and current data suggest that IRF8
harbors dual functions as either a transcriptional activator or

repressor. Genome-scale gene expression analysis has revealed that
IRF8 regulates the expression of a large group of genes in
hematopoietic cells (32, 33). Therefore, it is not surprising that
IRF8 regulates a large set of gene expression in solid tumor cells as
well. However, it is unexpected that IRF8 regulates the expression
of several genes involved in apoptosis pathway, apparently at
multiple levels. Because the expression of some apoptosis-related
genes can be altered in the tumor microenvironment, defects in

IRF8 Regulates FLIP Expression

multiple mediators of the apoptosis pathway might thus confer the
tumor cells with a stable apoptosis resistance phenotype.
Therefore, tumor cells might use loss of IRF8 expression to acquire
a stable apoptosis resistance phenotype.
Although IRF8 is constitutively expressed in macrophages, other
myeloid cells, B cells, and T cells, expression of IRF8 can be
dramatically up-regulated by IFN-g (2). The relative roles of
constitutively expressed IRF8 and IFN-g–activated IRF8 are still not
fully defined and remain an area of active research (2). IRF8 is also
constitutively expressed in certain nonhematopoietic tumor cells,
albeit at lower levels, but its expression can also be dramatically
up-regulated by IFN-g (8, 19) through the IFN-g receptor–mediated
signaling pathway (34). IFN-g has been shown to sensitize tumor
cells to apoptosis through regulating caspase-8 or Bcl-2 expression
(35, 36). In this study, IFN-g treatment did not alter the expression
levels of caspase-8 and Bcl-2 (Fig. 2B; data not shown) in mouse
sarcoma cells. Because IFN-g can regulate the expression of several
IRF8-binding partner proteins in sarcoma cell lines (19), we suspect
that IFN-g treatment may induce IRF8-binding proteins that
neutralize the effects of IFN-g–regulated target genes. However, the
exact molecular mechanisms under this phenomenon remain to be
determined.
Although disrupting IRF8 function significantly increased FLIPs
expression in CMS4.K79E cells, disrupting IRF8 function also
diminished Fas receptor expression (16). Because Fas DISC
formation requires Fas receptor engagement, diminished Fas
receptor level will certainly lead to diminished Fas DISC level in
CMS4.K79E cells, which may explain why less procaspase-8 is
associated with the Fas DISC in CMS4.K79E cells (Fig. 2A). The
diminished Fas expression level in CMS4.K79E cells also prevents
us from determining whether increased FLIPs protein level inhibits
procaspase-8 association with and caspase activation in the Fas
DISC.
Both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are regulated by IRF8 in hematopoietic
tumor cells (5, 12, 13). Although our initial attempts did not detect
the effects of IRF8 on Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in sarcoma cells (data not
shown), other studies have shown important roles of Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 in apoptosis, including TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in both
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor cells (36–38). Further
studies are needed to examine the different regulatory mechanisms
underlying IRF8 regulation of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 between hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic tumor cells.
IRF8 protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in certain myeloid
lineages during monocytic leukemia development (13, 39–41). In
myeloid leukemia, tyrosine phosphorylation increases IRF8 accumulation in the cytoplasm and inhibits IRF8 translocation to the
nucleus in the blast crisis stage but not in the chronic stage (13).
Phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of IRF8 nuclear localization
in the blast crisis stage resulted in elevated Bcl-2 expression and
apoptosis resistance (13), suggesting that IRF8 phosphorylation

regulates IRF8 function in myeloid leukemia pathogenesis. In this
study, we observed that IRF8 protein is largely absent in the nuclei
of human STS tumor cells and weakly to moderately present in the
cytoplasms (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is possible that the cytoplasmic
IRF8 protein observed in the human STS patient specimens might
be phosphorylated. Such phosphorylation could inhibit IRF8
nuclear translocation and function in sensitizing the tumor cells
to apoptosis, which may particularly explain the chemoresistance
of human STS. Further studies are needed to elucidate the
phosphorylation status of IRF8 protein in human STS cells and
to delineate its potential links to IRF8 subcellular localization and
STS pathogenesis in human patients. IRF8 is also regulated by DNA
methylation at the IRF8 promoter region in hematopoietic and
nonhematopoietic tumor cells (8, 11, 42–44). Further studies are
also needed to determine whether DNA methylation at the IRF8
promoter region also mediates IRF8 levels in human sarcoma.
A common feature of human sarcoma is resistance to
conventional chemotherapy (1). Induction of apoptosis is the basis
of many chemotherapeutic agents, including TRAIL, in cancer
therapy (45, 46). Our data clearly suggest that FLIP is widely
expressed in high-grade human STS tumors in vivo, implying that
cell death–inducing agents may not therefore be effective in
sarcoma therapy. In support of our hypothesis that loss of IRF8
expression and/or function is responsible, at least in part, for the
FLIP-mediated apoptosis resistance phenotype in human STS,
restoration of IRF8 expression by transfection sensitized human
sarcoma cells to apoptosis (Fig. 6). More importantly, forced
expression of IRF8 also sensitized human sarcoma cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis. TRAIL protein is considered a promising
therapeutic agent for human sarcoma therapy (47) and is being
tested in clinical trials to treat metastatic human cancers (48). Our
findings collectively suggest that TRAIL therapy alone may not be
effective, whereas combinational therapies targeting IRF8 expression in combination with conventional TRAIL therapy could
potentially be an effective approach to overcoming chemoresistance in human STS therapy, a possibility that we are currently
examining.
