ABSTRACT
Inter- and intra-tumour molecular heterogeneity is increasingly recognized in clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). It may partially explain the diversity of responses to
targeted therapies and the various clinical outcomes. In this study, a 56-year-old male
ccRCC patient with multiple metastases received radical nephrectomy and resection of the
metastatic tumour in chest wall. The surgical specimens were implanted into nude mice
to establish patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with KI2367 model derived from the
primary tumour and KI2368 model from the metastastic tumour. The two modles were
treated with Sorafenib, Sunitinib, Axitinib, combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib, or alternating
therapy of Sorafenib and Sunitinib. Significant anti-tumour activity was found in KI2367
treated with Sorafenib/Sunitinib monotherapy, combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib, and
alternating therapy of Sorafenib/Sunitinib (P<0.05) but not in that treated with Axitinib
monotherapy. In contrast, KI2368 was significantly responsive to Sunitinib monotherapy,
combined Sorafenib/Sunitinib therapy and alternating therapy of Sorafenib/Sunitinib
but not responsive to Sorafenib and Axitinib monotherapy (P<0.05). RNAseq of the two
models demonstrated that the expression levels of 1,725 genes including the drug targeted
genes of PDGFA, PDGFB and PDGFRA were >5-fold higher in KI2367 than in KI2368 and
the expression levels of 994 genes were > 5-fold higher in KI2368 than in KI2367. These
results suggest the presence of intra-tumour molecular heterogeneity in this patient. This
heterogeneity may influence the response to targeted therapies. Multiple biopsy, liquid
biopsy and genomic analysis of intra- tumour molecular heterogeneity may help guide a
more precise and effective plan in selecting targeted therapies for ccRCC patients.

sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and proteomics has
increased our knowledge about the molecular mechanism
of tumourigenesis. On the other hand, the overall incidence
of cancers is gradually increasing [1]. The modern concept

mortality and treatment complications. The second
generation sequencing technology has revealed multiple
genetic changes in tumours, providing the basis for drug
development and personalized cancer treatment. The
precision medicine for managing cancers is progressive
and attractive. The identification of driver mutations
that are critical for tumourigenesis remains a challenge.
Several malignant tumours have recently achieved
personalized cancer treatment in clinical practice, such
as anti-HER2 antibody for HER2-positive breast cancer,
anti-EGFR therapy for KRAS wild-type colon cancer, and
BRAF inhibitor for BRAF mutant melanoma [2–5].
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can be divided into
several subtypes according to its histology and molecular
differentiation [6-8]. In recent decades, the incidence of
RCC has been rapidly increasing at 2.5 percent per year.
In 2012, there were about 338,000 new cases of kidney
cancer worldwide and an estimated 143,000 cases died
of kidney cancer, ranking as the 16th most common
cause of cancer death [9-11]. The increased incidence
of kidney cancer was partly attributed to the wide use of
imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound [12].
Surgery is still the preferred treatment to eradicate the
tumour, but approximately 30% of patients undergoing
nephrectomy for localized RCC develop metastases [9,
10]. Moreover, RCC is insensitive to chemoradiotherapy.
The development of targeted drugs has significantly
improved the prognosis of metastatic RCC [13-17]. They
target the molecules relating to tumour development to
inhibit tumour growth, but few patients got complete
or long-term response. Genome-wide studies have
confirmed significant genetic diversity among RCCs and
found several important driver mutations and multiple of
passenger changes in RCCs, which partially explain the
heterogeneous clinical outcomes of patients with similar
histopathological type [18-21]. In addition to intertumour heterogeneity, intra-tumour heterogeneity with
diverse genetic subclones within a single tumour has been
gradually recognized in RCC [22].
Although a large number of molecular changes
in hundreds of renal tumours have been obtained by
genome-wide analyses, the effects of these changes on
the characteristics of the tumour and clinical presentations
have not been clearly elucidated [23, 24]. The therapeutic
effect and development of targeted therapies for RCC
may be hampered by the inter-tumour and intra-tumour
heterogeneity. Single tumour-biopsy may not be able to
fully reflect the genetic composition of the tumour due to
intra-tumour heterogeneity, causing considerable challenges
to the development of individualized precise treatment.
Here we investigated the intra-tumour heterogeneity
of gene expression and mutation load in primary and
metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and
analyzed the diverse responses to targeted therapies using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Surgical
samples of primary and metastatic ccRCC were collected
from a patient. Two PDX models were established to
test their responses to targeted therapies. Transcriptome
sequencing (RNA-seq) of PDXs was performed to detect
the genetic diversity between the primary and metastatic
ccRCC.

RESULTS
Patient prognosis
The patient was discharged 6 days after the
operation. His general status was well after the operation
for one month. Afterwards, the patient began to take
Sorafenib (400 mg oral, twice daily). Partial response was
obtained for his pulmonary metastasis, brain metastasis
progressed [25]. The patient died after the operation for
6 months.

Results of molecular target drugs in treating the
kidney carcinoma model of KI2367
The KI2367 PDX model was derived from the
primary ccRCC tumour. We treated this model with
three monotherapies (Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Axitinib),
Sorafenib and Sunitinib combined therapy, and Sorafenib/
Sunitinib alternating therapy. The results showed that there
was obvious anti-tumour activity from Sorafenib/Sunitinib
monotherapy and from combined and alternating treatment
of Sorafenib and Sunitinib, with the ΔT/ΔC% values of
-66.91%, -46.57%, -238.03% and -60.24% respectively.
However, Axitinib showed no significant anti-tumour
activity to KI2367, with the ΔT/ΔC% value of 82.11%. A
statistically significant difference was observed between
vehicle/Axitinib and other treatment groups (P<0.05).
No significant difference or synergistic tumour growth
inhibition was observed between the 4 effective treatment
groups (Figure 1; Table 1).

Results of molecular target drugs in treating the
kidney carcinoma model of KI2368
The KI2368 PDX model was derived from the
metastatic ccRCC in left chest wall of the patient. We
observed obvious anti-tumour activity from Sunitinib
monotherapy and combined and alternating treatments
of Sorafenib and Sunitinib, with the ΔT/ΔC% values of
40.09%, 12.25%, and 23.12% respectively. However,
there were no significant anti-tumour activities from
Sorafenib and Axitinib monotherapy, with the ΔT/ΔC%
values of 79.02% and 85.45% respectively. A statistically
significant difference was observed between vehicle/
Sorafenib/Axitinib and the other treatment groups
(P<0.05). Synergistic tumour growth inhibition was
observed in the Sorafenib and Sunitinib combined therapy

to result in protein variants were found in KI2367 and
KI2368 respectively, and 4,023 mRNA changes predicted
to result in protein variants were found both in KI2367 and
KI2368. The variant detection by RNAseq largely depends
on the gene expression level, and it is likely that many of
the variants are false positives. We also found 20 and 4 inframe gene fusions in KI2367 and KI2368, respectively,
but no common in-frame fusion was detected (Table 3; see
Supplementary Figure 1-5 for validation).
PDGFRA was highly expressed in KI2367, but not
expressed in KI2368. The expression level of PDGFRB

DISCUSSION

KI2368, which may impact the expression of PDGFRB
and other genes (Table 5; Supplementary Figure 6).
Moreover, a frameshift mutation in RICTOR that may
affect HIF1A function and subsequently PDGFR
expression was found in KI2368, and a frameshift
mutation in VEGFB was detected in KI2368 but not in
KI2367 (Table 5; Supplementary Figure 7).

In recent years, the incidence of RCC has rapidly
increased. On the other hand, adjuvant therapies for RCC
have also been greatly improved and several randomized
trials for RCC have been carried out. The early studies
included trials of chemotherapy, hormonotherapy,
immunotherapy such as interferon alpha and interleukin-2

showed obvious anti-tumour activity for Sunitinib monotherapy, Sorafenib and Sunitinib combination or alternating treatment. However,
no significant anti-tumour activity for Sorafenib or Axitinib monotherapy was seen in the model. A significant difference was observed
between vehicle/Axitinib/Sorafenib and other treatment groups (P<0.05). Synergistic tumour growth inhibition was observed in the

[26–32], and autologous vaccination strategies [33–36].
These were the alternatives for treatment at the time
but were less effective for metastatic RCC, and the
overall outcomes were unsatisfactory [37, 38]. With the
development of cancer therapy, we are now in the era
of second-generation adjuvant studies [39]. Targeted
therapies inhibit the tumour progression by interfering
with tumour-associated signaling molecules involved in
cancer growth, invasion and metastasis [13, 40-45].
The targeted drugs of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) and anti-VEGF antibodies, such as Sorafenib,
Sunitinib, Pazopanib and Axitinib are now recommended
as the first- or second-line treatment for RCC. Sunitinib
has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency as
a first-line treatment for RCC [46]. The mammalian target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of kanamycin (mTOR) inhibitor Temsirolimus has been
approved for the first-line treatment of RCC patients with
poor-prognosis, and Everolimus has been recommended
for patients with advanced RCC or unresponsive to antiVEGF therapies [42]. The targeted therapies have obtained
better progression-free survival compared with either
placebo, IFN or IL-2 treatment [13, 40-45].
Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve complete
and long-term tumour control with targeted therapy.
Tumours may adapt to chronic drug use and escape from
drug-mediated growth control [47]. Only a portion of
patients responded well to the targeted therapies. With the
recognition of more key molecules in the tumourigenic
signalling pathway of RCC including VEGF, PDGF
and EGF, new agents against these targets have been
developed [48]. New targeted drugs such as cabozantinib

a single tumour has been gradually recognized in RCC
[22]. Nowell reported that subclones have the same
origin and share common genetic changes; but each
subclone also harbours unique somatic mutations [55].
Gerlinger et al. applied next-generation sequencing to
characterize intra-tumour heterogeneity in primary and
metastatic ccRCC [23, 24]. Genomics analyses from
multiple regions of a primary tumour identified a common
clonal origin. Somatic mutation and allele imbalance in
different subclones showed considerable variability. Of
note, the alteration of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–
mTOR appeared in different subclones of RCC, possibly
relating to resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Gerlinger et al.
also compared the genetic alterations between primary
and metastatic RCCs, and demonstrated that metastatic
RCC had genetic features different from those of primary
tumour [23, 24]. Therefore, metastatic tumours may
originate from rare primary tumour clones, consistent with
the findings in other malignancies [56–59].
Our results also indicate that molecular
heterogeneity especially the intra-tumour heterogeneity is
an important factor for the diversity of response to targeted
therapies. This patient had multiple metastases in brain,
lung, and skin and underwent right radical nephrectomy.
After the operation, the patient received Sorafenib therapy.
During the follow-up period, metastases in lung became
stable but metastases in brain progressed. Finally, the
patient died of brain metastases. Subsequently, Sorafenib
had a diverse effect on metastases at different locations in
the same patient. The PDX models of KI2367 and KI2368
showed different responses to Sorafenib monotherapy
(in group 2), also indicating that metastases in different
locations may have different molecular changes that
may relate to the diverse responses to targeted therapies.
Consequently, metastatic tumours could have diverse
responses and some may become resistant to the targeted
therapies[60].
We observed that KI2367 and KI2368 had
different response to the TKIs, indicating that primary
and metastatic tumours have different genomic profiles.
RNAseq analysis reveals that PDGFRA is highly expressed
in KI2367 but not expressed in KI2368. The expression of
PDGFRB is higher in KI2367 than in KI2368. Conversely,
KIT is expressed in KI2368 but not expressed in KI2367.
HIF1 is known to induce the transcription of many
angiogenesis-related genes. The frameshift insertion
in HIF1A may impact on the expression of PDGFRB
and other genes in KI2368. The frameshift mutation of
RICTOR in KI2368 may also affect the function of HIF1A
and subsequently PDGFR expression. It is possible that
the difference in PDGFR expression affects the drug
responses in KI2367 and KI2368. We also found a VEGFB
frameshift mutation in KI2368 but not in KI2367. VEGFB
is dispensable for blood vessel growth but is critical for
their survival of blood vessels. The VEGFB mutation
may reduce the effectiveness of drugs such as Axitinib on

Expression in log2(FPKM).

and lenvatinib have recently been approved for treating
advanced renal cell carcinoma [49, 50]. Sequential therapy
is considered to be an innovative option that provides
maximal efficacy with a minimum risk of therapeutic
failure [51, 52]. The agent that is still useful after
resistance to a TKI-based regimen remains unclear.
Another hypothesis for the poor long-term effect
of targeted therapies is the heterogeneity of RCC. The
high-throughput sequencing have identified significant
genetic diversity and screened out several important driver
mutations and multiple of passenger changes in RCC [53,
54]. The diversity of drug response, resistance to targeted
therapies and varied clinical outcomes may be partly
attributed to the molecular heterogeneity of RCC.
Inter- and intra-tumour molecular heterogeneity are
intriguing and important characteristics of tumours. Intratumour heterogeneity with diverse genetic subclones in

the PDGFR and VEGFR. Axitinib is reported to inhibit
KIT and the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Sorafenib also
inhibits RAF family kinases, and Sunitinib inhibits KIT,

RET, CD114 and CD135. It is likely that the activation
of kinases other than PDGFR and VEGFR influences
the different efficacy of the three drugs. In KI2368, we
observed that the anti-tumour activity of combined or

alternating therapies was stronger than monotherapy. The
combined or alternating therapies can inhibit more targets
and block the tumour growth.
Taken together, these findings confirm again that
there is intra-tumour molecular heterogeneity in ccRCC.
The intra-tumour heterogeneity could influence the clinical
outcome of targeted therapies and explain the diverse drug
response among metastatic tumours at different sites from a
ccRCC patient. Therefore, intra-tumour heterogeneity may
lead to tumour evolution and becomes a huge challenge
to the development of personalized therapy for RCC. A
single tumour-biopsy may not be able to accurately reflect
the features of a tumour. Multiple biopsy, liquid biopsy
and genomic analysis could further identity intra-tumour
molecular heterogeneity. Multiple biopsies in patients with
multiple metastases are not clinically feasible. However,
with the development of minimally invasive technology and
imaging technology, it will be possible to collect multiple
biopsies. Furthermore, liquid biopsy is also a very popular
method and may be used in the future. Thereafter, precise
and comprehensive results could help us more effectively
plan targeted therapies. Further studies are needed to
understand the cause of intra-tumour heterogeneity in
ccRCC to guide the clinical treatment of patients.

previously [61, 62]. The specimens were sliced into
approximately 3×3×3 mm3 fragments (n=20), and 5 mice
were implanted with 4 blocks each. The dorsal surface
of the mouse was prepped with betadine solution, and
the specimens were subcutaneously inoculated into the
flanks of mice with a 16-G needle. The tumour growth
was monitored twice weekly using a calliper. The
established tumour models (passage 0 or P0) were serially
re-engrafted to maintain the tumours in vivo. These
subsequent passages were called P1, P2, P3, etc. When the
tumours reached 500–700 mm3 (1/2 length x width2), they
were harvested for the next round of engraftment for serial
passage or conducting studies of efficacy and molecular
analyses.

Clinical data of the patient
This 56 years old male patient had a right renal
tumour (Figure 3A) with a subcutaneous soft tumour in
his left chest wall (Figure 3B) and multiple pulmonary
and brain metastases (Figure 3, 3B and 3C).An open
radical nephrectomy was performed using the subcostal
flank approach, and the subcutaneous metastatic tumour
in left chest wall was resected as well. ccRCC metastases
were found in the 2 lymph nodes of the 6 resected
kidney pedicle lymph nodes. The peritoneum was also
invaded by the tumour. The adrenal was normal. The
pathological type was ccRCC (Figure 3D). The Fuhrman
grade was 4 and the pathological stage was pT4N1M1.
Immunohistochemical staining of vascular density (CD34)
is shown in Figure 3 (3E and 3F).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Female BALB/c nude mice (4-6 weeks, 1620g, SPF degree) were supplied by Beijing FuKang
Bioscience (Beijing, China, Animal Certificate No.:
11401300025891). Procedures related to animal handling,
care, and treatment in this study were performed according
to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Crown Bioscience
following the guidance of the Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

Treatment of PDX lines with targeted therapies
Treatment for mice was initiated when the tumours
from 2 ccRCC PDX models reached 100 mm3 to 150
mm3. The established PDX models were KI2367 from
the primary tumour and KI2368 from the subcutaneous
metastatic tumour of the chest wall. Each PDX model was
divided into 6 experimental groups with 4 mice in every
group. The control group (Group 1) was treated orally with
vehicle daily (QD)*4 weeks, and the treatment groups
were treated with one of following dosing regimens:
Sorafenib (Group 2, 50 mg/kg p.o. QD*4 weeks, Dalian
Meilun Biotech Co., Ltd), Sunitinib (Group 3, 60 mg/
kg p.o. QD*4 weeks, Dalian Meilun Biotech Co., Ltd),
Axitinib (Group 4, 15 mg/kg, p.o. QD*4 weeks, Dalian
Meilun Biotech Co., Ltd), Sorafenib 50 mg/kg+sunitinib
60 mg/kg p.o. (Group 5, QD*4 weeks) and Sorafenib
50 mg/kg and Sunitinib 60 mg/kg in alternation (Group
6, Weeks 1 and 3, dose with Sunitinib QD, p.o.; Weeks
2 and 4, dose with Sorafenib QD, p.o.). The %ΔT/ΔC
value was calculated for assessing the tumour response
to the treatment. (%ΔT/ΔC= (mean(T)-mean(T0))/
(mean(C)-mean(C0)) *100%, T- Treatment group value,
T0 - Treatment group initial value, C - control group

Collection of tumour specimens
The patient was diagnosed with ccRCC at the
Department of Urological Oncology of Peking University
Cancer Hospital. All protocols in this study were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Medical Ethics Committee,
and written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
After operation the specimens were examined by pathologists,
and some of the samples were used for laboratory study. The
specimens for PDX models were preserved in HTK solution
(CUSTODIOT, XISAIER Technology, Beijing, China) at
4°C and treated within 6 hours..

growth inhibition (TGI) = (1-%ΔT/ΔC))*100.
The mice were kept in individually ventilated cage
(IVC) systems at constant temperature and humidity, with
4 animals in each cage. The data for tumour growth and
normal behaviour including mobility, visual estimation
of food and water consumption, body weight gain/loss
measured twice weekly, eye/hair matting and any other
abnormal effects, were collected every 3 to 4 days. Tumour
sizes were measured every 3 to 4 days using the formula: V
= 0.5 length x width2. Samples of mice treated with vehicle
were stored for future analysis. Any remaining tumour was
re-implanted for maintenance of a PDX model.

Genomic analysis of PDXs
Snap frozen PDX tumour samples were used to
extract RNA for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq).
The purity and integrity were checked with an Agilent
Bioanalyzer prior to RNA sequencing. Only RNA
samples with RIN >7, 28S/18S >1 and mouse content
<10% were used for library construction and sequencing.
The sequencing was performed at PE125 on an Illumina
HiSeq2500 platform (KI2367) and PE100 on an Illumina
HiSeq2500 platform (KI2368) by certified Illumina
service providers. The RNAseq raw data were first cleaned
by removing reads that were preferentially mapped to a
mouse genome (UCSC MM9). Transcript expression
was estimated by MMSEQ [63] and represented by
log2(FPKM). SNP and INDELs were detected by STAR
[64] mapping software and GATK [64] variant discovery
toolkit, and gene fusions were detected by SOAP fuse [65]
and deFuse [66].
