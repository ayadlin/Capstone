Abstract
The bradykinin receptor B1R is overexpressed in many human
cancers where it might be used as a general target for cancer
imaging. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using
radiolabeled kallidin derivatives to visualize B1R expression in
a preclinical model of B1R-positive tumors. Three synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for receptor binding and
their ability to visualize tumors by PET. Enalaprilat and phosphoramidon were used to evaluate the impact of peptidases
on tumor visualization. While we found that radiolabeled peptides based on the native kallidin sequence were ineffective at
visualizing B1R-positive tumors, peptidase inhibition with phos-

phoramidon greatly enhanced B1R visualization in vivo. Two
stabilized derivatives incorporating unnatural amino acids
(68Ga-SH01078 and 68Ga-P03034) maintained receptor-binding afﬁnities that were effective, allowing excellent tumor
visualization, minimal accumulation in normal tissues, and
rapid renal clearance. Tumor uptake was blocked in the presence of excess competitor, conﬁrming that the speciﬁcity of
tumor accumulation was receptor mediated. Our results offer a
preclinical proof of concept for noninvasive B1R detection by
PET imaging as a general tool to visualize many human cancers.

Introduction

Because of low expression in normal tissues, B1R is an attractive
target for the development of imaging probes to visualize B1Rpositive (B1Rþ) tumors. Furthermore, because bradykinin receptors are important mediators of pain and inﬂammation, radiopharmaceuticals targeting these receptors might be useful to
understand the role of the kinin-kallikrein system in human
tumors in vivo and explore the relationship between these receptors, the immune system, and cancer progression. Although
ﬂuorescent derivatives have been reported for microscopy and
ﬂow cytometry (10, 11), there have been so far few successful
attempts to visualize B1R-expressing tissues noninvasively, in vivo.
Stahl and colleagues described a 99mTc-labeled peptide
(HOE 140) to visualize B2R expression, and evaluated the biodistribution of this compound in healthy mice (12). Fuchs and
colleagues reported the visualization of chronic cutaneous
delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in mice using a 11C-labeled
sulfonamide targeting B1R, but high, nondisplaceable background activity was observed with the radiotracer (13). The
purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate radiolabeled
peptides to noninvasively visualize B1R expression in vivo.

The bradykinin receptor family is constituted of two subtypes,
B1 and B2, which are involved in the response to tissue damage
and are important mediators of pain and inﬂammation. These
G-protein–coupled receptors bind bradykinin and kallidin,
which are produced by enzymatic cleavage of kininogens (1).
The overexpression of the B1 and B2 receptors (B1R and B2R)
has been documented in many cancers (2). While B2R is ubiquitously expressed, B1R has low endogenous expression in
normal tissues. Molina and colleagues showed that B1R was
expressed in a high proportion of ductal breast carcinomas in situ
as well as invasive ductal breast carcinomas (3). Increased B1R
expression was also noted in prostate carcinomas (4). Activation
of B1R and/or B2R has been reported to promote the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases (3), upregulate matrix
metalloproteinases (5), and stimulate cell invasion and metastasis (6, 7). Crosslinked dimers of bradykinin analogs have also
been proposed as therapeutic agents for prostate cancer and
small cell lung cancers (8, 9).

DOTA-conjugated peptide (4 mmol) and GaCl3 (20 mmol) in
500 mL sodium acetate buffer (0.1 mol/L, pH 4.0) was incubated at 80 C for 15 minutes. The methods for conjugation
with nonradioactive gallium are described in the Supplementary Data section. We prepared three conjugated peptides:
Ga-DOTA-Ahx-[Leu9, desArg10]kallidin (hereafter referred as
P03083), Ga-DOTA-Ahx-[Hyp4, Cha6, Leu9, desArg10]kallidin
(SH01078), and Ga-DOTA-PEG2-[Hyp4, Cha6, Leu9, desArg10
]kallidin (P03034). The chemical structures of the peptides are
shown in the Supplementary Data.
Radiochemistry
An Eckert & Ziegler IGG100 68Ga generator was used to obtain
68
Ga. Radioactivity of 68Ga-labeled peptides was measured using
a Capintec CRC-25R/W dose calibrator. The 68Ga generator was
eluted with a total of 4 mL of 0.1 mol/L HCl. The elution that
contained the activity was mixed with 2 mL concentrated HCl. The
mixture was passed through a DGA resin column and the column
was washed by 3 mL 5 mol/L HCl. After the column was dried by
passage of air, 68Ga was eluted off with 0.5 mL water. The puriﬁed
68
Ga solution was added to a 4-mL glass vial preloaded with
0.7 mL of HEPES buffer (2 mol/L, pH 5.0) and the DOTAconjugated precursor. All labeling procedures were performed in
a conventional microwave oven, using a 1-minute reaction time.
Microwave labeling was used because of previous experience
achieving high yields in a short time using similar peptides—it
is likely that similar results can be obtained with conventional
heating. This step was followed by HPLC puriﬁcation to ensure
high-speciﬁc activity for preclinical imaging. For 68Ga-P03083,
50 mg of peptide was used. The reaction mixture was puriﬁed
by HPLC using the semipreparative column eluted with 17/83
CH3CN/PBS (pH 7.1) at a ﬂow rate of 4.5 mL/minute. For
68
Ga-P03034, 50 mg of precursor was used and the reaction
mixture was puriﬁed by HPLC using the semipreparative column
eluted with 18/82 CH3CN/PBS (pH 7.1) at a ﬂow rate of 4.5 mL/
minute. 68Ga-SH01078 was synthesized using 100 mg of
the radiolabeling precursor and puriﬁed using the same conditions as 68Ga-P03034. The quality control was performed by
HPLC on the analytical column eluted with 16/84, 18/82, and
19/81 CH3CN/PBS at a ﬂow rate 2 mL/minute, for 68Ga-P03083,
68
Ga-P03034, and 68Ga-SH01078, respectively. The retention
times of 68Ga-P03083, 68Ga-P03034, and 68Ga-SH01078 were
6.8, 7.7, and 6.1 minutes, respectively. The speciﬁc activity of the
68
Ga-labeled peptides was measured using the analytical HPLC
system. It was calculated by dividing the injected radioactivity
(37 MBq) of ﬁnal products by the mass of the peptides in the
injected solution. The mass of 68Ga-labeled peptides was estimated by comparing the UV absorbance obtained from the injection
with a previously prepared standard curve.
Stability in mouse plasma
Balb/c mouse plasma for stability studies was obtained from
Innovative Research. Aliquots (100 mL) of the 68Ga-labeled peptide (P03083, P03034, and SH01078) were incubated with 400
mL of balb/c mouse plasma for 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes at 37 C.
At the end of each incubation period, samples were quenched
with 500 mL 70% CH3CN and centrifuged for 20 minutes. The
metabolites were measured using a semipreparative HPLC system
(Agilent). The suspension was loaded onto the HPLC and eluted
with 17/83 CH3CN/PBS (pH 7.1), 23% MeCN (0.1% TFA),
and 23% MeCN (0.1% TFA) at a ﬂow rate of 4.5 mL/minute, for

Ga-P03083, 68Ga-P03034, and 68Ga-SH01078, respectively.
The retention times of 68Ga-P03083, 68Ga-P03034, and 68GaSH01078 were 16.6, 12.1, and 12.5 minutes, respectively.
LogD7.4 measurements
Aliquots (2 mL) of the 68Ga-labeled peptides were added to a
vial containing 3 mL of octanol and 3 mL of 0.1 mol/L phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). The mixture was vortexed for 1 minute and then
centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Samples of the octanol
(1 mL) and buffer (1 mL) layers were taken and counted in a well
counter. LogD7.4 was calculated using the following equation:
LogD7.4 ¼ log10[(counts in octanol phase)/(counts in buffer
phase)].

Creation of a stable B1R expression cell line
We used human embryonic kidney cells HEK293T transduced
with both GFP and B1R for this study, using separate vectors.
HEK293T cells were obtained from Clontech Laboratories. For
GFP transduction, we used the Lenti-XTM Expression System
(Clontech Laboratories), using the pGIPz(TurboGFP) cloning
vector. For B1R overexpression, GFP-positive HEK293T cells
were transduced using premade inducible lentiviral particles at
1  107 IFU/mL, obtained from GenTarget (cat. no. LVP291). The
B1R open reading frame was constitutively expressed under a
suCMV promoter. An antibiotic blasticidin—RFP (red ﬂuorescence protein) fusion marker under Rous sarcoma virus promoter
was present in the expression vector to allow for selection and
veriﬁcation of transduced cells. The presence of both GFP and RFP
expression was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence microscopy using a
Nikon Eclipse TE2000 E confocal microscope.
Receptor-binding assays
The afﬁnity of the peptides for B1R was measured using
competitive binding assays. Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes overexpressing the recombinant human B1R receptor
(PerkinElmer) were used for those assays. Brieﬂy, 96-well MultiScreen plates with glass ﬁber ﬁlter and polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) support (Millipore) were presoaked with 0.5% of cold
polyethyleneimine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. Afterward,
wells were washed once with 50 mmol/L of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The
wells were loaded with the assay buffer containing 50 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mmol/L of MgCl2. Varying concentration
of nonradioactive control Lys-(Des-Arg9)-Bradykinin (Bachem)
or the peptides of interest were added in the presence of 4.8 nmol/L
of [3H]-(des-Arg10, Leu9)-Kallidin (PerkinElmer). B1R membranes were added to each well to a ﬁnal protein concentration
of 50 mg/well. The MultiScreen plate was incubated at 27 C for
15 minutes with gentle agitation at 300 rpm. The assay was
stopped by aspirating the reaction solution through the PVDF
membrane ﬁlter, followed by washing with ice-cold 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The ﬁlter membranes were dried before adding
scintillation liquid, and the activity in the plates was measured
using a 1450 MicroBeta Counter (PerkinElmer). Data analysis was
performed with GraphPad Prism 5, using a one-site competitive
binding model. The Ki was calculated from the IC50 using the
Cheng–Prusoff equation.
The successful transduction of B1R was also measured by a
saturation assay on B1Rþ HEK293T cell membranes. Brieﬂy, the
cells were disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer, and cell
membranes were isolated by sequential centrifugation. Protein
concentration was determined using a Bradford assay. Of note,

Bradykinin Receptor B1 Imaging

50 mg of membrane protein per well was used for the saturation
assay. The assay conditions were similar to the competitive
binding assays with the exception that progressively higher concentrations of radioactive [3H]-(des-Arg10, Leu9)-Kallidin were
used (range 0.05–20 nmol/L), with and without the presence of
excess competitor [30 mmol/L Lys-(Des-Arg9)-Bradykinin,
Bachem]. GraphPad Prism 5 was used to calculate the binding
afﬁnity (Kd) and receptor concentration (Bmax), normalized in
fmol/mg of protein.
Biodistribution experiments
Animal experiments were approved by the University of British
Columbia Animal Care Committee (Vancouver, BC, Canada).
Male immunodeﬁcient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG)
mice were obtained from an in-house breeding colony at the
Animal Resource Centre of the BC Cancer Agency Research Centre.
B1Rþ and negative (B1R) HEK293T tumors were inoculated by
subcutaneous injection of 1  106 cells on each dorsal ﬂank of the
mice. Thus, each mouse had a positive and negative control. After
growth period ranging from 10 days to 14 days, palpable tumors
measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter were obtained. Mice
(n ¼ 4–7 per group) were injected with either 0.37 MBq or
3.7 MBq of 68Ga-labeled peptides, depending on whether the
mice were used solely for biodistribution or for imaging followed
by biodistribution. For blocking experiments, the radioactive
compound was coinjected with 100 mg of the same nonradioactive (e.g., natGa) compound. After 60 minutes of uptake, the mice
were anesthetized by isoﬂurane inhalation, and then euthanized
by CO2 inhalation. Blood was promptly withdrawn, and the
organs of interest were harvested, rinsed with normal saline,
blotted dry, and inserted into preweighted tubes. The tubes were
weighed again to obtain the exact organ weight. The radioactivity
of the collected mouse tissues was counted using a Cobra II
gamma counter (Packard), normalized to the injected dose using
a standard curve and expressed as the percentage of the injected
dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).
Preclinical imaging
PET imaging experiments were conducted using a Siemens
Inveon microPET/CT scanner. Mice bearing B1Rþ and B1R
tumors, as described above, were used for the experiments. In
some mice, dynamic scanning was performed to determine the
time-activity course of the radiopharmaceuticals in organs of
interest. The mice were sedated with 2% isoﬂurane inhalation
and positioned in the scanner. A baseline CT scan was obtained for
localization and attenuation correction before radiotracer injection, using 60 kV X-rays at 500 mA, three sequential bed position
with 33% overlap, and 220 degree continuous rotation. The mice
were kept warm by a heating pad during acquisition. The dynamic
acquisition of 60 minutes was started at the time of intravenous
injection with 3.7 MBq of 68Ga-labeled peptide, with or without
the presence of 100 mg of excess unlabeled natGa-peptide. The
list mode data were rebinned into time intervals (12  10, 6  30,
5  60, 6  300, 2  600 seconds) to obtain tissue time-activity

curves. As we noticed higher renal accumulation and lower
urinary excretion in these mice due to the effects of prolonged
isoﬂurane sedation, these animals were not used for biodistribution experiments or for the ﬁnal analysis of tumor uptake by
imaging at 60 minutes. Static imaging was done in the other mice.
The mice were brieﬂy sedated for intravenous injection of the
radiotracer, and then allowed to recover and roam freely in their
cages for 55 minutes. At that point, the mice were sedated with 2%
isoﬂurane inhalation, placed in the scanner, and an attenuation
correction CT scan was obtained as described above. A single static
emission scan was acquired for 10 minutes. The mice were
euthanized and the organs harvested for biodistribution.
Peptidase inhibition with phosphoramidon or enalaprilat
To determine the effects of peptidase inhibition on radiotracer uptake in target tissues, groups of mice injected with
68
Ga-P03083 were coinjected with either 0.3 mg of phosphoramidon or 0.25 mg of enalaprilat in normal saline. Imaging
and/or biodistribution was performed 55 to 60 minutes later,
as described above.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Prism 6 software
(GraphPad). Biodistribution data were analyzed by two-way
ANOVA, with the organs of interest as a factor, and the radiotracers
with or without peptidase inhibition as a second factor. Tukey
multiple comparison test was used to compare the uptake
in the tumors and organs between the following groups:
P03083 injected without peptidase inhibition, P03083 injected
with enalaprilat, and P03083 injected with phosphoramidon,
68
Ga-SH01078 and 68Ga-P03034. An adjusted P value of less than
0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Radiochemistry and plasma stability
The radiochemistry and plasma stability data are reported
in Table 1. Because of the use of HPLC, all radiopeptides were
obtained in good yield, at high-speciﬁc activities, suitable for use
in mice for receptor imaging. The stability tests performed in vitro
using mouse plasma showed relatively good stability for all
peptides in mouse plasma, with the best results obtained with
68
Ga-SH01078.
Cellular expression of B1R and binding afﬁnity
Following transduction with the hB1R, successful gene transfer
from the lentiviral construct was conﬁrmed by the expression of
RFP (Fig. 1). No red ﬂuorescence was observed in the control
HEK293T cell line. Saturation assays performed with [3H]-(desArg10, Leu9)-kallidin showed a maximal binding capacity (Bmax)
of 451  88 fmol/mg of protein for the B1Rþ HEK293T cell
membranes and 56  48 fmol/mg of protein for the control
HEK293T cells. The binding afﬁnities (Kd) of [3H]-(des-Arg10,
Leu9)-kallidin for those cell membranes were 1.9  0.5 and 1.6 
0.2 nmol/L, respectively. By competitive binding assays, the

Ga-P03083 coinjected with phosphoramidon or with the
stable derivatives 68Ga-SH01078 and 68Ga-P03034. Blocking
experiments were performed for 68Ga-P03034. The uptake of
68
Ga-P03034 in the B1Rþ tumor was completely blocked by the
coinjection with 100 mg of P03034 (Fig. 5). Time-activity curves
of the radiolabeled peptides showed progressive clearance from
the blood and nontarget tissues, with retention in B1Rþ tumors
and high activity in the kidneys (Fig. 6).

Biodistribution and imaging
The results of the biodistribution experiments are presented
in Fig. 2, and the entire data can be found in Supplementary
Data. The peptides cleared rapidly by urinary excretion, with
accumulation in the bladder and kidneys. No signiﬁcant uptake
was seen in other normal organs, with minimal background
activity. When 68Ga-P03083 was injected without peptidase
inhibitors, tumor uptake was 4-fold higher in the transduced
B1Rþ compared with the control B1R tumor. This did not
improve signiﬁcantly when 68Ga-P03083 was coinjected with
enalaprilat. Enalaprilat increased renal uptake of 68Ga-P03083,
but did not improve tumor accumulation. However, when coinjected with phosphoramidon, a signiﬁcant increase (P < 0.0001)
in radiotracer uptake was noted in the B1Rþ tumors, with 9-fold
higher uptake compared with the B1R tumors (Fig. 3). Similarly,
the metabolically stable peptides (68Ga-SH01078 and 68GaP03034) led to signiﬁcantly higher accumulation in B1Rþ compared with B1R tumors (Fig. 4). With 68Ga-P03083 coinjected
with phosphoramidon, the average ratios of B1Rþ tumor to
plasma, B1Rþ tumor to muscle, and B1Rþ to B1R tumors were
9.2  3.7, 35  3, and 9.2  3.7, respectively. With 68Ga-SH01078,
the average ratios were 5.2  2.3, 28  5, and 4.4  1.0,
respectively. Similar results were obtained using a PEG linker,
as evidenced by the high tumor-to-background ratios obtained
with 68Ga-P03034. Thus, although the absolute tumor uptake
remained moderate due to rapid renal clearance of the radiolabeled peptides, excellent contrast was achieved using either

Bradykinin receptors are overexpressed in several human cancers
(2). Although B2R is expressed in normal tissues, normal physiologic expression of B1R is low (1). Thus, B1R is a potentially
attractive target for breast and prostate cancer detection. B1R
expression is stimulated by the presence of bradykinin, TNFa, and
IL1b (14). The soluble receptor of the globular heads of C1q
(sgC1qR) has also been shown to induce B1R expression in
endothelial cells (15). The cause of B1R overexpression in cancers
is not known. The presence of tissue kallikreins (notably kallikrein2 and kallikrein-3, also known as the prostate-speciﬁc antigen)
might play a role in the overexpression of B1R (4). In particular,
kallikrein-2 might release bradykinin locally from low- and highmolecular weight kininogens, which could chronically stimulate
the overexpression of B1R in cancer cells. Alternatively, the
immune system might contribute to enhance B1R expression due
to leukocyte inﬁltration associated with secretion of cytokines.
In this study, we observed that despite the addition of a chelator
and radiometal at the N-terminus of [Leu9, desArg10]kallidin,
receptor-binding afﬁnity was maintained using a short spacer. We
also showed that replacing proline and phenylalanine by
hydroxyproline and cyclohexylalanine at positions 4 and 6

deteriorated binding afﬁnity to B1R but improved metabolic
stability in vitro. More importantly, we demonstrated that it is
possible to visualize noninvasively B1R in vivo, by PET.
We found that using the native antagonist sequence did not
lead to good tumor visualization, and conﬁrmed that this was due
to peptidase activity. In vitro plasma stability assays did not predict
such low in vivo stability for 68Ga-P03083, suggesting that the
peptidase inactivating this peptide was not circulating in plasma.
Peptidase inhibition with phosphoramidon, but not enalaprilat, led to improved tumor uptake in vivo. The beneﬁcial effects of
phosphoramidon parallel the recent ﬁnding of Nock and colleagues, who observed higher levels of circulating intact radiopeptides and improved tumor visualization following phosphoramidon coadministration (16). Enalaprilat is an inhibitor of the
angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), whereas phosphoramidon inhibits endopeptidase 24.11 in addition to being a potent
inhibitor of ACE and other peptidases (15). ACE, carboxypeptidase N, and endopeptidase 24.11 have been implicated in the
degradation of bradykinin (7, 17). We did not see a statistically
signiﬁcant effect of enalaprilat on tumor accumulation of the
antagonist radiopeptides in this study. However, enalaprilat
administration led to slightly higher renal accumulation of
68
Ga-P03083. Whether this was caused by the effects of enalaprilat on kidney glomerular ﬁltration rate, or due to a change in
the nature of peptide fragments from 68Ga-P03083 degradation
remains uncertain.
Poor tumor uptake of the 68Ga-P03083, a peptide derived from
the native sequence of bradykinin, led us to design radiopeptides,

Ga-SH01078 and 68Ga-P03034, with unnatural amino acids to
improve stability. Despite lower afﬁnity to B1R than P03083,
images obtained using these modiﬁed peptides had signiﬁcantly
improved tumor uptake and tumor:background ratios when used
in the absence of peptidase inhibitors. All three peptides evaluated
in this study presented signiﬁcant renal accumulation. It is known
that small peptides are ﬁltered by glomerular ﬁltration, but can be
reabsorbed by endocytic receptors in proximal tubular cells,
notably megalin. The exact mechanisms by which the B1R peptides presented in this study accumulate in the kidneys remain
unknown, but likely follow similar mechanisms (18).
We obtained high-contrast images with minimal background
activity and excellent tumor visualization, despite moderate
absolute tumor uptake values. It is worth emphasizing that the
absolute tumor uptake is in part dependent on the clearance rate
of a radiopharmaceutical—typically much higher uptake is
observed with radiotracers that remain in circulation for many
days, such as antibodies, compared with lower molecular weight
radiotracers. Because higher tumor uptake values have been
achieved with other radiopeptides with similar molecular weight
(19), it is likely feasible to improve tumor visualization by further
improvements in metabolic stability, receptor-binding afﬁnity, or
by imaging at later time points to optimize the tumor-to-background ratio.
Although the overexpression of B1R has been well documented
in studies conducted on resected human tumor specimen, there
are no established models of a B1R-expressing tumor for preclinical studies. We thus used a transfected tumor model to avoid the

confounding factor of potentially limited target expression on
various commonly used in vitro cancer cell lines. This model
allowed us to directly compare, in the same animal, a tumor
overexpressing the target with the same tumor that expresses low
endogenous levels of B1R. Such models are commonly used in
preclinical studies for some radiotracers such as somatostatin
receptor ligands (20), but may not reﬂect the actual expression
levels that may be encountered in the clinical setting. Further
studies will be required to identify a suitable model with endogenous overexpression of B1R to more closely reﬂect the clinical
situation.
In conclusion, we demonstrated in this study that bradykinin
receptor imaging was possible using metabolically stable derivatives of [Leu9, desArg10]kallidin, a bradykinin receptor antagonist
sequence. Good receptor-binding afﬁnities to B1R were observed
after the addition of a radiometal chelator at the N-terminus of
these peptides. Protection from peptidase activity was critical to
achieve good tumor visualization in vivo for noninvasive imaging
of B1R expression. These radiolabeled peptides can readily be
translated for noninvasive imaging in human subjects. 68Ga, a
radioisotope that is readily available from a long-lived 68Ge
generator, does not require an on-site cyclotron and provides
excellent image quality with low radiation exposure.
The causes and signiﬁcance of B1R expression in human cancers
will require further investigations. B1R imaging could be a potential surrogate biomarker of the activity of some tissue kallikreins
(notably kallikrein 2), reﬂect an immune response to cancer cells
due to the known relationship between B1R expression and TNFa
and IL1b, or be intrinsically driven by other cellular processes.
Potential clinical applications of B1R imaging peptides in oncology include the early detection of breast and prostate cancers, and
the noninvasive assessment of B1R expression to predict potential

beneﬁts from drugs targeting this receptor. Provided that renal
accumulation can be mitigated or reduced, other potential applications include the possibility of using this receptor for the
delivery of peptide–drug conjugates, or for radionuclide therapy,
using peptides labeled with therapeutic a or b emitters.
