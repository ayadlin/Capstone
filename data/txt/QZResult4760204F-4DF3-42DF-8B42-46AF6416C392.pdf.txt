Author Manuscript

Gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, affect 10% of the world’s
population and are largely due to chronic H. pylori infection1–3. Species differences in embryonic
development and architecture of the adult stomach make animal models suboptimal for studying
human stomach organogenesis and pathogenesis4, and there is no experimental model of normal
human gastric mucosa. Here we report the de novo generation of three-dimensional human gastric
tissue in vitro through the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We
identified that temporal manipulation of the FGF, WNT, BMP, retinoic acid and EGF signaling
pathways and three-dimensional growth are sufficient to generate human gastric organoids
(hGOs). Developing hGOs progressed through molecular and morphogenetic stages that were
nearly identical to the developing antrum of the mouse stomach. Organoids formed primitive
gastric gland- and pit-like domains, proliferative zones containing LGR5-expressing cells, surface
and antral mucous cells, and a diversity of gastric endocrine cells. We used hGO cultures to
identify novel signaling mechanisms that regulate early endoderm patterning and gastric endocrine
cell differentiation upstream of the transcription factor NEUROG3. Using hGOs to model
pathogenesis of human disease, we found that H. pylori infection resulted in rapid association of

epithelial proliferation. Together, these studies describe a novel and robust in vitro system for
elucidating the mechanisms underlying human stomach development and disease.

The human stomach contains a complex, three-dimensional glandular epithelium that is
organized into two distinct functional domains5; the fundus (corpus), which is the major
source of peptidases and acid, and the antrum (pylorus) that comprises a concentration of
mucus-secreting cells and hormone-producing endocrine cells. Unlike other endoderm
organs, little is known about signaling pathways regulating gastric development and no one
has yet generated gastric tissues from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)6–8. Therefore,
to direct differentiation of hPSCs into complex, three-dimensional gastric tissue, we needed
to identify the signaling pathways that regulate several critical stages of early stomach
development including; 1) posterior foregut specification and formation of the anterior gut
tube, 2) gastric specification and patterning into the fundus or antrum, and 3) epithelial
growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation into gastric cell lineages.

Author Manuscript

We first differentiated hPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE)9, which in vivo is then
patterned along the anterior-to-posterior (A–P) axis and transformed into a gut tube
consisting of Sox2+ foregut in the anterior and Cdx2+ mid-hindgut in the posterior (Fig. 1a).
We previously demonstrated that WNT3A and FGF4 synergize to induce the morphogenesis
of gut tube-like structures expressing the posterior marker CDX26,10. To generate foregut,
from which the stomach derives, we aimed to stimulate gut tube morphogenesis with WNT
and FGF while inhibiting their ability to promote posterior fate. We found that WNT/FGF
require BMP activity to initiate posterior gene expression, consistent with the known role of
BMP as a posteriorizing factor11–13. Specifically, inhibiting BMP signaling with the
antagonist Noggin resulted in repression of the posterior marker CDX2, activation of the
foregut marker SOX2 and assembly of three-dimensional foregut spheroids (Fig. 1b–d and
Extended Data Fig. 1). Foregut spheroid morphogenesis was a robust process using both
hESC and hiPSC lines (Fig. 1c–d and Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, we identified a new
epistatic relationship between WNT, FGF and BMP in which all three pathways cooperate
to promote a mid-hindgut fate, but WNT and FGF act separately from BMP to drive
morphogenesis of gut tube structures.

The following events of stomach development in vivo are posterior patterning of the foregut
and specification of the fundic and antral domains of the stomach. To direct spheroids into a
posterior foregut fate (indicated by co-expression of Sox2 and Hnf1β; Fig. 1e), we focused
on retinoic acid (RA) signaling given its role in development of posterior foregut-derived
organs14–16. Exposing DE to RA for 24 hours on the final day (d5-6) of the patterning/
spheroid generation stage resulted in the formation of SOX2/HNF1β+ posterior foregut
spheroids (Fig. 1f–g and Extended Data Fig. 3). In vivo the posterior foregut undergoes
morphogenesis and is subdivided into the Sox2+/Pdx1− fundus, Sox2/Pdx1+ antrum, Pdx1/

Ptf1α+ pancreas, and Pdx1/Cdx2+ duodenum (Fig. 2b). To promote three-dimensional
growth and morphogenesis, we transferred posterior foregut spheroids to a semisolid matrix
and found that an additional 72 hours of RA (d6-9) caused a >100-fold increase in PDX1
mRNA levels while maintaining high SOX2 expression (Fig. 2c–d), indicating specification
into antrum. Importantly, the RA treatment did not promote a pancreatic fate8, since
expression of the pancreas-specific marker PTF1α17 was not induced (Fig. 2d). These data
demonstrate that the combination of RA signaling with three-dimensional growth efficiently
direct posterior foregut spheroids into a SOX2/PDX1+ epithelium indicative of a gastric
antrum fate.

The next stages of stomach development are characterized by growth of a pseudostratified
epithelium into an elaborate glandular epithelium. We explored various growth conditions
and found that high concentrations of EGF (100 ng mL−1) were sufficient to promote robust
outgrowth of SOX2/PDX1+ spheroids into human gastric organoids (hGOs). Over the
course of 3–4 weeks, spheroids (<100 μm in diameter) underwent dramatic expansion into
organoids (2–4 mm in diameter) containing a complex columnar epithelium (Fig. 2e). EGF
was required for the initial outgrowth of foregut spheroids as well as their expansion and
morphogenesis at later stages (Extended Data Fig. 4c), revealing a new role for EGFR
signaling during embryonic stomach formation that is temporally distinct from its postnatal
function as a trophic factor18,19. hGO development was remarkably similar to in vivo
stomach organogenesis. At early stages (E12-14 in mouse and 13-day hGOs), both epithelia
were pseudostratified, contained mitotic nuclei concentrated toward the apical surface
indicating interkinetic nuclear migration, and were appropriately polarized and contained
deep elaborations of aPKC+ apical membrane (Extended Data Fig. 4b)20. At later stages
(E16.5 – P12 in mouse, d13-34 in hGOs), the in vivo antrum transformed into a simple
columnar epithelium exhibiting a highly structured organization, and the hGOs underwent
similar folding and formed immature pit and gland domains (Fig. 2e–f and Extended Data
Fig. 4a).

Author Manuscript

Molecular markers that define the developing antrum in vivo showed analogous temporal
and spatial expression patterns in developing hGOs. At early stages (E12-14 in mouse and
13-day hGOs) the transcription factors Sox2, Pdx1, Gata4 and Klf5 were all co-expressed in
the immature, pseudostratified epithelium of the antrum (Extended Data Fig. 4). However at
later stages (E18-P12 in mouse and 34-day hGOs), Sox2 was down regulated as the
epithelium formed glands and pits, whereas the expression of the other factors was
maintained. Based on these data, the 13-day hGOs represent a developmental stage similar
to the E12-14 mouse antrum, whereas 34-day hGOs are more comparable to the late fetalearly postnatal antrum. Further, the early spheroid mesoderm expanded during organoid
differentiation, expressed mesenchymal transcription factors including FOXF1 and
BAPX121, and differentiated into VIM+ submucosal fibroblasts and a smaller number of
ACTA2+ subepithelial myofibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. 4–5). Thus, we conclude that
hGOs recapitulate normal embryonic development and that the molecular and
morphogenetic processes that occur during antrum development are conserved between
rodents and humans.

RNA-sequencing analysis showed that 34-day organoids and human fetal stomach tissue
share a highly similar transcriptional profile, which is distinct from human fetal intestine
(Extended Data Fig. 6b). The antral region in the embryonic and postnatal stomach can be
distinguished from the fundus by its expression of PDX1 (Fig. 2f), as well as by a
concentration of certain cell types. Antral cell types include mucous cells, which secrete the
protective mucus lining, and several endocrine lineages that regulate gastrointestinal
physiology and metabolic homeostasis (Fig. 3a). By day 27, hGOs robustly expressed
numerous transcripts that mark differentiated antral cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a),
including surface mucous cells (MUC5AC, TFF1/3, and GKN1) and antral gland cells
(TFF2), but not cell types associated with the fundus/corpus such as parietal cells
(ATP4A/B) and chief cells (MIST1), or intestinal goblet cells (MUC2). At day 34,
histological analysis revealed that both mucous cell lineages were abundant in the hGOs
(Fig. 3b–f): surface mucous cells with tall columnar morphology and apical MUC5AC
expression, and MUC6+ antral gland cells that were concentrated toward the base of the
glands. Parietal cells (ATP4B) were undetectable in the hGOs, and the lack of fundus cell
types coupled with ubiquitous PDX1 expression are consistent with an antral identity (Fig. 2
and Extended Data Fig. 4). The adult antrum contains pure glands with only antral lineages
and mixed glands containing both antral and fundic lineages22. However, PDX1 expression
remains restricted to antral cell types even in mixed glands22, suggesting the possibility that
PDX1+-progenitor cells only give rise to antrum-specific cell types postnatally. Thus we
conclude that the PDX1-expressing hGOs are a pure antrum/pylorus cell population.

Author Manuscript

The antrum also contains LGR5-expressing stem cells23 and specialized endocrine cells. At
34 days, hGOs contained a SOX9+ proliferative progenitor zone as well as LGR5+ cells at
the base of the glands (Fig. 3d–f and Fig. 4a), identified using a transgenic LGR5:eGFP
reporter hESC line (Extended Data Fig. 7). hGOs contained a complete spectrum of
endocrine cells normally found in the antrum that were positive for the hormones gastrin,
ghrelin, somatostatin, and serotonin (Fig. 3g). Interestingly, we observed that high levels of
EGF repressed expression of the proendocrine transcription factor NEUROG324,25 and the
formation of endocrine cells, whereas low EGF (10 ng ml−1) supported endocrine cell
formation (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). Transient over-expression of NEUROG3 was
sufficient to overcome the endocrine inhibitory effect of EGF, resulting in robust
differentiation of gastric endocrine cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e–g). In summary, hGOs have
a high degree of cellular complexity that rivals that of the human antrum, they can be
experimentally manipulated, and they therefore represent the first in vitro model of human
stomach development.

Author Manuscript

Clinical evidence indicates that predominant colonization of the antrum has an important
role in H. pylori-mediated disease26,27. Thus, we tested whether hGOs could be used to
model the pathophysiologic response of human stomach to H. pylori. To mimic the normal
host-pathogen interface, we microinjected H. pylori directly into the lumen of the epithelium
and measured epithelial signaling and proliferation. Within 24 hours, bacteria were observed
tightly associated with the hGO epithelium (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9b) and we
observed significant epithelial responses including robust phosphorylation c-Met28 (Fig. 4b,
Extended Data Fig. 9c) and a 2-fold increase in epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 4c). The H.

pylori virulence factor CagA plays a pivotal role in the etiology of disease. Consistent with
published studies29, we observed that CagA translocated into organoid epithelial cells and
formed a complex with the c-Met receptor (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the epithelial response
was lost when hGOs were injected with a strain of H. pylori lacking CagA, demonstrating
the dependence of CagA for H. pylori-mediated human pathogenesis. Thus, the
pathophysiological response of hGOs makes them an unprecedented model for elucidating
the initiating events of human gastric disease mediated by H. pylori.

Author Manuscript

In summary, hGOs represent the first human gastric tissue fully derived in vitro and are one
of the most physiologically complex micro-organ systems yet established. The hGOs
undergo normal stages of in vivo differentiation, comprise an array of cell types that
constitute the normal antral epithelium, and contain a complex three-dimensional
organization. We have used hGOs as an in vitro system to identify signaling mechanisms
that regulate human stomach development and physiology, and we have modeled the
pathophysiological response of the gastric epithelium to H. pylori. Thus hGOs should
present new opportunities for drug discovery and modeling early stages of gastric disease
including cancer. Moreover, this is the first three-dimensional production of a human
embryonic foregut, which is a promising starting point for the 3-dimentional generation of
other foregut organ tissues including fundus, lungs and pancreas.

Methods
Pluripotent stem cell culture

Human embryonic stem cell lines WA01 (H1) and WA09 (H9) were obtained from WiCell.
ESC and iPSC lines were maintained as colonies in feeder-free conditions on HESCqualified Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in mTesR1 media (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells
were routinely passaged every four days with dispase (Invitrogen).
Differentiation of definitive endoderm
For differentiation, PSCs were plated as single cells in a Matrigel-coated 24-well dish using
accutase (Stem Cell Technologies), at a density of 150,000 cells per well in mTesR1 with
ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM; Stemgent). On the following day, PSCs were
differentiated to DE as previously described9,31. Cells were exposed to Activin A (100 ng
ml−1; Cell Guidance Systems) for three days in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) containing
increasing concentrations of 0%, 0.2%, and 2.0% define fetal bovine serum (dFBS;
Invitrogen). In addition, BMP4 (50 ng ml−1; R&D Systems) was added on the first day of
DE induction.

spheroids in the culture wells. To posteriorize the foregut endoderm, RA (2 μM; Sigma
Aldrich) was added on the third day of WNT/FGF/Noggin treatment.
Three-dimensional culture of gastric organoids
The spheroids were transferred to a three-dimensional in vitro culture system as previously
described6,10. Briefly, spheroids were collected, resuspended in 50 μl Matrigel (BD
Biosciences), and plated in a three-dimensional droplet. After Matrigel was allowed to
solidify for 10–15 minutes in a tissue culture incubator, spheroids were overlaid with gut
media: Advanced DMEM/F12 with N2 (Invitrogen), B27 (Invitrogen), L-glutamine, 10 μM
HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, and EGF (100 ng ml−1; R&D Systems). For the first three
days, RA and Noggin were added to the gut media. Media was replaced every 3–4 days, as
necessary. At day 20, organoids were collected and re-plated in fresh Matrigel at dilution of
~1:12.

Generation of dox-inducible hNEUROG3 hESC line
To generate over-expression construct, hNEUROG3 cDNA (Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer
Center DNA Resource Core; clone HsCD00345898) was cloned into pInducer20 lentiviral
vector (generously provided by T. Westbrook32) using Gateway Cloning (Invitrogen)
methods. High-titer lentiviral particles were produced by the CCHMC Viral Vector Core.
H1 hESCs were dissociated with Accutase, plated as a single cell suspension in mTesR1
with 10 μM Y-27632, and exposed to lentivirus for four hours. mTesR1 was replaced daily
and after two days, G418 (200 μg ml−1) was added to the media to select for integrated

Generation of LGR5:eGFP BAC transgenic reporter hESC line

Author Manuscript

BAC RP11-59F15 was obtained from the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute
(http://bacpac.chori.org/) and grown in SW10533 cells. A single colony was expanded in LB
+cam at 32°C. When the culture reached an optical density of OD600=0.5, recombineering
proteins were induced by incubation at 42°C for 20 minutes. After induction, cells were
spun at 5,000 × g, washed in ice cold water, and resuspended in 200 μl ice cold 10%
glycerol. The recombination cassette consisted of eGFP-FRT-PGKgb2-neo/kan-FRT, 50 bp
homology region in LGR5, and a 20 bp homology region to peGFP-PGKneo. The homology
regions were selected to replace the initiator methionine of LGR5 with that of eGFP
followed by a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal and FRT flanked bifunctional
kanamycin/G418 resistance cassette. The recombination cassette was electroporated into
SW105 cells, and cells were selected on plates with cam and kanamycin (kan; 50 μg ml−1).
Clones were analyzed for properly targeted LGR5 BAC by PCR (sequences listed in
Methods Table 3) and confirmed by sequencing and nucleofected into single cell
suspensions of H9 hESCs using the Amaxa Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Starter Kit.
Cells were selected for in G418 (200 ng ml−1) for two weeks. G418-resistant cells were
maintained in antibiotic indefinitely. All primer sequences are listed in Methods Table 3.

Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were cultured from neonatal human foreskin
tissue and obtained from 2 donors through the Department of Dermatology, University of
Cincinnati, and were a kind gift from Susanne Wells PhD. HFFs were cultured in Fibroblast
Media consisting of DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone) and used
for reprogramming between passages 5 and 8. EBNA1/OriP-based episomal plasmids
pCLXE-hOct3/4-shp53, pCLXE-hSox2-Klf4, pCLXE-hLmyc-Lin28, and pCLXE-GFP used
for this study were previously described34 and obtained from Addgene (ID #s: 27077,
27078, 27080, and 27082 respectively). The optimized Human Dermal Fibroblast
Nucleofector Kit (VPD-1001; Lonza) was used for transfection of HFFs with episomal
plasmids. Briefly, for each transfection 1 × 106 HFFs were pelleted by centrifugation at
200xg for 10 minutes at room temperature, resuspended in 100 μl room temperature
Nucleofector Solution and nucleofected with 1.25 μg each episomal plasmid (program U20).
Cells from 2 transfections (2 × 106 total cells) were replated in a 10 cm tissue culture plate
in Fibroblast Media, and cultured at 37°C/5% CO2. Six days post-transfection, 4.5 × 105
HFFs were replated in Fibroblast Media in a gelatin-coated 10cm dish containing 1.07 × 106
irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Starting on day 7 post-transfection, cells
were fed daily with DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 20% knockout serum
replacement, 1 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM non-essential amino
acids, and 4 ng ml−1 basic FGF (all from Invitrogen). Approximately 2 weeks later, discrete
colonies with hESC-like morphology were manually excised and replated in mTeSR1 media
(Stem Cell Technologies) in tissue culture dishes coated with hESC-qualified matrigel
(Becton Dickinson). Following adaptation to mTeSR1/matrigel culture, iPSCs that
maintained robust proliferation and hESC-like morphology with minimal spontaneous
differentiation were expanded for characterization including testing for mycoplasma
(MycoAlert kit, Lonza) and cryopreservation.
Standard metaphase spreads and G-banded karyotypes were determined by the CCHMC
Cytogenetics Laboratory. For teratoma formation, iPSCs from 3 wells of a 6-well dish were
combined and gently resuspended in ice-cold DMEM/F12. Immediately before injection,
matrigel was added to a final concentration of ~33% and cells were injected subcutaneously
into immune-compromised NOD/SCID GAMMA C−/− mice. Tumors formed within 6–12
weeks. Excised teratomas were fixed, embedded in paraffin, and sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Taqman hPSC Scorecard Assay (Life
Technologies) was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.

experiments, antibiotics were removed from the organoid growth medium.
Immunofluorescent staining

Author Manuscript

All tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for either one hour at room temperature for
frozen processing or overnight at 4°C for paraffin processing. For frozen sections, tissue was
protected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C, then embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek), and cut at
10 μm. For paraffin sections, tissue was processed through a graded ethanol series, followed
by xylene, and then embedded in paraffin and cut at 7 μm. Tissue culture cells were fixed for
15 minutes at room temperature and stained directly. For staining, frozen slides were thawed
to room temperature and rehydrated in PBS, while paraffin slides were deparaffinized and
subjected to antigen retrieval. Slides were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson
Immuno Research) in PBS plus 0.5% Triton-X for 30 minutes at room temperature. Primary
antibodies (listed in Methods Table 1) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated
overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for one
hour at room temperature, and coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern
Biotech). Confocal images were captured on a Nikon A1Rsi inverted confocal microscope.
TEM imaging

Organoids were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M sodium
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 16 hours at 4oC. Organoids were then washed using 0.1M
sodium cacodylate buffer followed by a 1 hour incubation using 4% osmium tetroxide,
washed and then dehydrated using 25–100% ethanol (series of dilutions), embedded using
propylene oxide/LX112. Blocks were sectioned (150 nm) and stained with 2% uranyl
acetate followed by lead citrate. Tissue was visualized using a Hitachi transmission electron
microscope equipped with an AMT Image Capture Engine version 5.42.366 and MicroFIRE
by Optronics camera using AMTV600 digital camera software.
RNA isolation and qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from tissues using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Machery-Nagel).
Reverse transcription was performed from 100 ng RNA using Superscript VILO cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR was done using
Quantitect SybrGreen Master Mix (Qiagen) on a CFX-96 Real-time PCR Detection System
(BioRad). Analysis was performed using the ΔΔCT method. PCR primers were designed
using sequences from qPrimerDepot (http://primerdepot.nci.nih.gov) and are listed in

GEO (SRA) database (Accession number GSE18927)39. Raw reads were quality checked
for each sample using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
(version 0.10.1) to identify features of the data that may indicate quality problems (e.g. low
quality scores, over-represented sequences, inappropriate GC content, etc.). Initial QC report
indicated over-representation of Illumina adapter sequences in samples from EBI-AE data
set and NCBI-GEO data set. Adapter sequences were trimmed from the reads using
Cutadapt (version 0.9.5). We used the software package Tuxedo Suite for alignment,
differential expression analysis, and post-analysis diagnostics40–42. Briefly, reads were
aligned to the reference transcriptome (UCSC hg19, http://genome.ucsc.edu) using TopHat
(version 2.0.9) and Bowtie (version 2.1.0.0). We used default parameter settings for
alignment, with the exception of: “--b2-very-sensitive” instructing the software to spend
extra time searching for valid alignments, as well as “--no-coverage-search” and “--nonovel-juncs” to limit the read mapping to known transcripts. In addition, we used FastQC
for a second round of quality control (post-alignment), to ensure that only high quality data
would be input to expression quantitation and differential expression analysis. We used
Cufflinks/CuffDiff (version 2.1.1) for expression quantitation and differential expression
analysis, using UCSC hg19.fa as the reference genome sequence and UCSC hg19.gtf as the
reference transcriptome annotation. We generated diagnostic plots using the CummeRbund
package (http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/).

4560) at 4°C for 16 hours. Protein A/G agarose beads (20 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were then added and the samples were incubated at 4°C for 16 hours. Immunoprecipitates
were washed 3 times in PBS and then resuspended in Laemmli Loading Buffer containing βmercaptoethanol (40 μl; BioRad). The positive control for phosphorylate c-Met was whole
cell lysate from EGF stimulated A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells (Santa Cruz

immunoprecipitated lysates. The positive control for immunoprecipitated CagA is lysate
from G27 H. pylori, showing the CagA band co-migrates with the band in the c-Met
immunoprecipiated lysates. Samples were run on a 4–20% Tris-Glycine Gradient Gel

to promote a posterior fate

Author Manuscript

a, Activation of Wnt signaling with WNT3a or the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021 (CHIR; 2
μM) induced a posterior fate and this was blocked by BMP inhibition. n=3 biological
replicates per condition. b, Activation of Wnt signaling with WNT3a or CHIR induced gut
tube morphogenesis and spheroid production. c, Immunofluorescent staining of monolayer
cultures confirmed the high efficiency of CDX2 induction by CHIR/FGF treatment, and that
noggin blocked posterior CDX2 expression and induced expression of the foregut marker
SOX2. d, qPCR analysis of BMP target genes MSX1/2 indicated that BMP activity is not
increased in response to Wnt/FGF, but target genes are suppressed in response to noggin,
suggesting that noggin acts on endogenous BMP signaling. n=3 biological replicates per
condition. e, Addition of BMP2 (100 ng mL−1) did not substitute for or augment the ability
of Wnt/FGF to posteriorize endoderm. These data indicate that the posteriorizing effect of
Wnt/FGF is not mediated by up-regulation of BMP signaling but does require endogenous
BMP activity. n=3 biological replicates per condition. Scale bars, 1 mm in b; 100 μm in c.

a, Comparison of transcription factor expression between hGO development and in vivo
stomach organogenesis. Four embryonic stages (E12.5, E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5) and one
postnatal stage (P12) of in vivo antrum development were analyzed for expression of the
following transcription factors: Sox2, Pdx1, Gata4, Klf5, and FoxF1. The same markers
were analyzed at two stages (day 13 and day 34) of in vitro hGO development and revealed
that organoid development parallels what occurs in vivo. At early stages of antrum
development the epithelial marker Sox2 was expressed ubiquitously but at later stages it is
down-regulated, while other epithelial transcription factors, Pdx1, Gata4 and Klf5, exhibit
persistent expression in the epithelium throughout development. Both early and late stage
hGOs contain FoxF1-positive mesenchymal cells surrounding the epithelium, similar to the
in vivo antrum. b, Early stage human gastric organoids exhibit stereotypic epithelial

architecture and nuclear behavior. At 13 days, hGOs contained pseudostratified epithelia
that display apicobasal polarity marked by the apical marker aPKC and the basolateral
marker E-Cadherin, similar to the E12.5 mouse antrum. Further, extensions of apical
membrane (white arrows) were seen within deeper portions of the organoid epithelium. Both
the E12.5 mouse antrum and day 7 hGOs appeared to undergo interkinetic nuclear
migration, indicated by the presence of mitotic nuclei, pHH3, in only the apical portions of
cells. c, EGF is required for morphogenesis in gastric organoids. Bright field images
demonstrate the requirement for EGF in epithelial morphogenesis including folding and
gland formation at late stages of hGO differentiation. When EGF is removed from the
growth medium at day 27, prior to glandular morphogenesis, the hGO epithelium retains a
simple, cuboidal structure that fails to form glands. Scale bars, 100 μm in a, 50 μm in b, 2

differentiated antral cell types

a, qPCR analyses of cell lineage differentiation marker expression at several stages
throughout the gastric organoid differentiation protocol (d0, d3, d6, d9, d20, d27, and d34)
and d34 human intestinal organoids (hIO). Beginning at day 27, hGOs robustly induced
genes expressed in differentiated cell types including surface mucous cells (MUC5AC,
TFF1, TFF3, and GKN1) and antral gland cells (TFF2). HGOs do not up-regulate
expression of markers found in fundic lineages such as parietal cells (ATP4A and ATP4B)
and chief cells (MIST1) or intestinal goblet cells (MUC2). Expression levels are normalized
to d3 DE cultures. n=3 biological replicates per time point. b, Muc5AC-expressing surface
mucous cells in the late fetal (E18.5) mouse antrum are not yet confined to a pit region and
are more broadly distributed through the antral epithelium. Further, these pit cells exhibit
high amounts of intracellular mucin staining, similar to 34-day hGOs. c, Global gene
expression profiling of 34-day hGOs was performed using RNA-seq, and data were
compared to published RNA-seq datasets from human tissues. Hierarchical clustering
revealed that hGOs closely resemble human fetal stomach tissue but not human fetal
intestine. Error bars represent standard deviation.

SOX17 were all highly enriched in both LGR5:eGFPLO and LGR5:eGFPHI endoderm
populations compared to undifferentiated controls, and the LGR5:eGFPHI cells showed
significant enrichment of LGR5 mRNA, but not FOXA2 or SOX17, compared to the
LGR5:eGFPLo population. n=3 biological replicates for each group and error bars represent
the S.E.M. *, p<0.05. This analysis suggests that the LGR5:eGFP BAC construct drives
eGFP expression in endoderm cells with the highest levels of LGR5 expression. e, H9LGR5:eGFP hESCs were differentiated into antral gastric organoids. Bright field and GFP
stereomicrographs of 30-day hGOs showed that the organoid epithelium developed

a, Endocrine cell differentiation in the antrum is first evident at E18.5 and highly robust at
postnatal stages (P12 shown). As early as e18.5, all expected gastric endocrine subtype
hormones are present, including gastrin, ghrelin, somatostatin, and serotonin (5-HT). b,
High levels of EGF (100 ng ml−1) repressed NEUROG3 expression, however a reduction in
EGF concentration (10 ng ml−1) at day 30 resulted in a significant increase in NEUROG3
expression measured at day 34 by qPCR. *, p<0.05; student’s t-test; n=5 biological
replicates, data representative of 3 independent experiments. c, hGOs maintained in high
concentrations of EGF (100 ng mL−1) had very few endocrine cells at day 34, shown by
staining for the pan-endocrine marker CHGA. However, a reduction of EGF concentration
(10 ng mL−1) at day 30 resulted in more physiologic numbers of endocrine cells in the
gastric epithelium. d, Schematic indicating the effects of EGF at different stages of hGO
growth, morphogenesis, and cell type specification. High levels of EGF were required at
early developmental stages for growth and morphogenesis, however it repressed endocrine
differentiation at late stages of development; thus, the EGF concentration was reduced at
day 30 to allow for endocrine cell development. e, To test whether EGF repression of
endocrine differentiation occurs upstream of NEUROG3, hGOs were generated from a
hESC line stably transfected with a dox-inducible NEUROG3-overexpressing transgene.
hGOs were maintained in high EGF (100 ng mL−1) then at day 30 were treated with
doxycycline (1 μg mL−1) for 24 hours and then analyzed at day 34. f, Dox-treated hGOs
show robust activation of endocrine markers CHGA, GASTRIN, GHRELIN, and
SOMATOSTATIN, and (g) they contain CHGA, GHRELIN, and SOMATOSTATIN
expressing cells with endocrine morphology. *, p<0.05; student’s t-test; n=3 biological
replicates per condition, data representative of 2 independent experiments. Therefore
NEUROG3 overexpression was sufficient to induce gastric endocrine cell fate in a high EGF
environment. Scale bars, 100 μm. Error bars represent standard deviation.

Figure 3. Human gastric organoids contain differentiated antral cell types

Author Manuscript

a, Schematic representation of a typical antral gland showing normal cell types and
associated molecular markers. b–g, Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that 34-day
hGOs consisted of normal cell types found in the antrum, but not the fundus. The hGO
epithelium contained surface mucous cells that express MUC5AC (b1, b1′), similar to the
postnatal day 12 (P12) mouse antrum (b2, b2′), but not ATP4B-expressing parietal cells (c1,
c1′) that characterize the fundus (c2, c2′). SOX9+ cells were found at the base of the hGO
epithelium (d1, d1′), similar to the progenitor cells found in the P12 antrum (d2, d2′).
Further, hGOs contained MUC6+ antral gland cells (e) and LGR5-expressing cells (f).
Boxed regions in b–f are shown as high magnification images indicated by an apostrophe
(’). g, Day 34 hGOs also contained endocrine cells (SYP) that expressed the gastric
hormones GAST, SST, GHRL, and serotonin (5-HT). Scale bars, 100 μm in b–f, 20 μm in b
′–f′ and g. Marker expression data are representative from a minimum of 10 independent
experiments, except LGR5-GFP data, which is a representative example from two separate
experiments.

Figure 4. Human gastric organoids exhibit acute responses to H. pylori infection

Author Manuscript

a, Day 34 hGOs contained a zone of MKI67+ proliferative cells similar to the embryonic
(E18.5) and postnatal (P12) mouse antrum. b, Using hGOs to model human-specific disease
processes of H. pylori infection. Pathogenic (G27) and attenuated (ΔCagA) bacteria were
microinjected into the lumen of hGOs and after 24 hours, bacteria (both G27 and ΔCagA
strains) were tightly associated with the apical surface of the hGO epithelium. c,
Immunoprecipitation (IP) for the oncogene c-MET demonstrates that H. pylori induced a
robust activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of c-MET, and this is a CagA-dependent
process. Further, CagA immunoprecipiated with c-MET, suggesting these proteins interact
in hGO epithelial cells. Lysates that were immunoprecipitated are underlined, phospho-cmet and CagA control lysates were not immunoprecipitated but used to confirm molecular
weights. The molecular weight markers are indicated (130 and 170kd) and shown in
extended figure 9c. d, Within 24 hours, H. pylori infection caused a CagA-dependent twofold increase in the number of proliferating cells in the hGO epithelium, measured by EdU
incorporation. *, p<0.05; two-tailed student’s t-test; n=3 biological replicates per condition,
data representative of 4 independent experiments. Scale bars, 100 μm in a, 20 μm in b. Error
