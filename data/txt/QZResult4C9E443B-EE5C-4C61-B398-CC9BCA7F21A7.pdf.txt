Abstract
Chemoresistance is a serious limitation of cancer treatment1. Until recently, almost all the work
done to study this limitation has been restricted to tumour cells2. Here we identify a novel
molecular mechanism by which endothelial cells regulate chemosensitivity. We establish that
specific targeting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) in endothelial cells is
sufficient to induce tumour-cell sensitization to DNA-damaging therapies and thus inhibit tumour
growth in mice. The clinical relevance of this work is supported by our observations that low
blood vessel FAK expression is associated with complete remission in human lymphoma. Our
study shows that deletion of FAK in endothelial cells has no apparent effect on blood vessel

function per se, but induces increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation within perivascular
tumour-cell compartments of doxorubicin- and radiotherapy-treated mice. Mechanistically, we
demonstrate that endothelial-cell FAK is required for DNA-damage-induced NF-κB activation in
vivo and in vitro, and the production of cytokines from endothelial cells. Moreover, loss of
endothelial-cell FAK reduces DNA-damage-induced cytokine production, thus enhancing
chemosensitization of tumour cells to DNA-damaging therapies in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our
data identify endothelial-cell FAK as a regulator of tumour chemosensitivity. Furthermore, we
anticipate that this proof-of-principle data will be a starting point for the development of new
possible strategies to regulate chemosensitization by targeting endothelial-cell FAK specifically.

Despite encouraging initial responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapies and radiotherapy,
many tumours become resistant to treatment1. Previous work has concentrated on
understanding resistance by focusing on mechanisms within tumour cells2. Although recent
evidence suggests that the tumour stroma can regulate chemoresistance, the underlying
molecular mechanisms are largely unknown3–9.
FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and regulator of cell migration, proliferation and
survival10. FAK can also regulate transcription via its scaffolding functions in the nucleus11.
Although some studies have implicated a role for endothelial-cell FAK in tumour growth
and angiogenesis12–14, its role in the regulation of chemoresistance has not been identified.

Here we demonstrate that targeting endothelial-cell FAK, in established tumours, is
sufficient to sensitize tumour cells toDNA-damaging therapies. Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice
were injected subcutaneously with mouse melanoma (B16F0) or lung carcinoma (CMT19T)
cell lines. At 7 days after tumour-cell inoculation, endothelial-cell FAK deletion was
induced, generating ECFAKKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 1). Mice were then treated with
one of two forms of DNA-damaging therapies: doxorubicin or radiation. Similarly treated
Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed mice or Fakfl/fl mice (ECFAKWT) were used as controls for
endothelial-cell FAK expression. Loss of endothelial-cell FAK did not affect B16F0 or
CMT19T tumour growth in placebo-treated or non-irradiated mice (Fig. 1a, b), nor did it
affect tumour angiogenesis, blood vessel perfusion, or endothelial-cell apoptosis in vivo
(Extended Data Fig. 2). In contrast to deleting endothelial-cell FAK before tumour
development14, here our data indicate that endothelial-cell FAK deletion after tumour
growth has begun is not sufficient to affect blood vessel density, results that are supported
by other studies15,16. Moreover, we go on to show that doxorubicin or radiation therapy in
ECFAKWT mice was not sufficient to affect B16F0 or CMT19T tumour growth,
respectively, indicating that these tumour types are not sensitive to such forms of therapy in
vivo (Fig. 1c, d). In contrast, endothelial-cell FAK deletion resulted in sensitizing B16F0
tumours to doxorubicin, causing a significant delay in tumour growth when compared with
similarly treated ECFAKWT mice (Fig. 1c). Likewise, endothelial-cell FAK deletion in mice
bearing CMT19T tumours sensitized tumours to radiation therapy, also leading to a
significant decrease in tumour growth rates (Fig. 1d). Despite elevated numbers of γH2AXpositive tumour-cell nuclei (an indicator of DNA damage) in ECFAKKO when compared
with ECFAKWT mice after treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3a), no changes in tumour blood
vessel permeability, doxorubicin delivery, tumour hypoxia or CD45-positive immune-cell

infiltration were observed between genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 3b–e). These data suggest
that loss of endothelial-cell FAK enhances tumour-cell responses to DNA damage without
affecting the delivery function of blood vessels. Indeed, using other mouse models of cancer
—experimental metastasis to the lung, using either tail-vein injection of B16F10 melanoma
or EuMycBCL2 lymphoma—we show that loss of endothelial-cell FAK is sufficient to
sensitize tumours to doxorubicin and significantly extend median survival (Extended Data
Fig. 4). Together, these data demonstrate that endothelial-cell FAK deletion alone is
sufficient to sensitize tumours to DNA-damaging therapies.

The clinical relevance of our results is also apparent in human cancer. Chemotherapy can
induce complete remission and be curative in some subsets of lymphoma. However, many
patients are resistant to doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy, and either fail to achieve
remission or relapse and subsequently show progression months or even years later17,18. We
asked whether disease progression in lymphoma patients correlated with altered bloodvessel FAK expression. First, sections of human lymphoma samples, all taken at diagnosis,
were analysed for the percentage of FAK-positive blood vessels. Results showed that, after
doxorubicin-containing treatment, a high percentage of FAK-positive blood vessels was
associated significantly with subsequent disease progression, while a low percentage of
FAK-positive blood vessels correlated significantly with complete remission (Fig. 1g). This
result is unlikely to be due to a direct effect of doxorubicin treatment on FAK expression
levels because, although doxorubicin can affect FAK localization in endothelial cells,
suggesting a possible change in function, it does not affect FAK expression levels (Extended
Data Fig. 5). Second, using matched samples taken at diagnosis and at relapse, endothelialcell FAK expression was elevated significantly at relapse when compared with expression
levels at diagnosis (Fig. 1h–j). Overall, our data indicate a substantial correlation between
chemoresistance and endothelial-cell FAK levels in human cancer.

Previous reports have suggested that chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may result in
perivascular chemoresistant niches that actually protect tumour cells from apoptosis7,19.
However, the regulators of this process within the endothelium in vivo have not yet been
identified. We show, at 48 h post-treatment cessation, that the number of blood vessels
within apoptotic perivascular tumour-cell niches, detected by cleaved caspase 3 staining,
was enhanced significantly in doxorubicin-treated ECFAKKO mice when compared with
similarly treated ECFAKWT or placebo-treated mice (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, tumour-cell
proliferation, detected by Ki67 staining, was reduced in perivascular zones of doxorubicintreated ECFAKKO mice when compared with controls (Fig. 2b). Similar results were
observed for radiotherapy-treated ECFAKKO mice (Fig. 2c, d). No differences between
ECFAKWT and ECFAKKO mice in non-treated groups were observed (Fig. 2a–d). These
results suggest that, upon DNA damage, endothelial cells may provide protective paracrine
signals to tumour cells, which are absent when endothelial-cell FAK is deleted. To confirm
this, we show that although conditioned media from untreated wild-type and FAK-null
endothelial cells has no apparent effect on tumour-cell survival, conditioned media from
either doxorubicin or irradiated wild-type endothelial cells protects cultured tumour cells
from DNA damage over time and allows for tumour-cell growth. In contrast, conditioned
media from either doxorubicin-treated or irradiated FAK-null endothelial cells confer

chemo- and radio-sensitivity to tumour cells, reducing their survival in vitro (Fig. 2e, f).
Together, these results demonstrate a novel role for endothelial-cell FAK in tumour-cell
sensitization to doxorubicin treatment or radiotherapy by the release of paracrine signals.

We next sought to identify the molecular basis for these endothelial-cell effects by FAK.
Activation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB family of transcription factors is known
to mediate cellular responses to DNA-damaging therapies20; however, a role for FAKdependent NF-κB functions in endothelial-cell responses to chemotherapy has not been
defined previously. In NF-κB luciferase reporter assays, doxorubicin-treated FAK-null
endothelial cells exhibited significantly reduced levels of NF-κB activity when compared
with similarly treated wild-type controls cells (Fig. 3a). Corroborating these results, while
doxorubicin-treated wild-type endothelial cells induced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, this was significantly blocked in FAK-null endothelial cells at 4, 24 and 48 h
after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3b, c and Extended Data Fig. 6). These data are supported
by increased levels of phosphorylated p65 (Ser 536) in nuclear fractions from wild-type, but
not FAK-null, endothelial cells after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3d) and decreased levels of
phosphorylated-IκBα in cytosolic fractions of doxorubicin-treated FAK-null endothelial
cells (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, nuclear localization of p65 in vivo, an indicator of
NF-κB activity, was evident in vivo in the tumour endothelium of ECFAKWT, but not
ECFAKKO, mice that had been treated with doxorubcin (Fig. 3e). Thus, our data indicate a
novel role for endothelial-cell FAK in doxorubicin-induced control of NF-κB activation in
vitro and in vivo.

Although other signalling pathways may be involved, FAK-dependent regulation of the NFκB pathway has been shown to be a major regulator of cytokine production in tumour
cells21–26. However, the regulation of cytokine production in endothelial cells, especially
after DNA-damaging treatment, is not known. Therefore, we next examined whether
endothelial-cell FAK deficiency affected doxorubicin-induced cytokine production.
Cytokine protein array analysis revealed that doxorubicin stimulation induced an increase in
production of several cytokines in wild-type endothelial cells when compared with untreated
controls. In contrast, doxorubicin-induced responses were not increased after DNAdamaging therapy in FAK-null endothelial cells (Fig. 4a). A reduction in fold-increase of
cytokine levels, some similar to those found after doxorubicin treatment, was also observed
after irradiation of FAK-null endothelial cells when compared with irradiated wild-type
controls (Extended Data Fig. 8). Cytokine levels were similar between untreated wild-type
and FAK-null endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a). An indicator of cytokine and
interleukin activity is phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3. We show that
doxorubicin treatment enhances the percentage of tumour cells with phosphorylated (p)STAT3 in ECFAKWT mice, but not tumour cells of similarly treated ECFAKKO mice
(Extended Data Fig. 9b), corroborating our results of reduced cytokine production in
doxorubicin-treated ECFAKKO mice. These data provide in vivo evidence for decreased
cytokine effects in doxorubicin-treated ECFAKKO when compared with similarly treated
ECFAKWT mice.
To expand the mechanistic basis of chemosensitization in ECFAKKO mice, we tested
whether inactivation of the NF-κB signalling pathway in wild-type endothelial cells is

sufficient to mimic FAK-null endothelial cells. Wild-type endothelial cells were transfected
with the super-repressor, non-phosphorylatable mutant form of IκBα, IκBαSR, which has
been shown previously to inhibit the NF-κB pathway27. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by
IκBαSR transfection of wild-type endothelial cells reduced DNA-damage-induced cytokine
production when compared with similarly treated mock-transfected controls (Fig. 4b). These
data indicate that inhibition of the NF-κB pathway is sufficient to mimic the reduced NF-κB
signalling effect in FAK-null endothelial cells after DNA damage. Indeed, conditioned
media from doxorubicin-treated, IκBαSR-transfected wild-type endothelial cells was
sufficient to sensitize cultured tumour cells to doxorubicin, when compared with mocktransfected wild-type endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, conditioned medium from
doxorubicin-treated IκBαSR-transfected wild-type endothelial cells was able to reduce
tumour-cell survival, phenocopying the chemosensitization responses conferred by FAKnull endothelial cells (Fig. 4c). Lastly, intratumoral administration of recombinant
granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (15 ng) or interleukin (IL)-6
(3 ng), were sufficient to induce similar tumour growth rates in ECFAKWT and ECFAKKO
mice, reversing the chemosensitization phenotype in ECFAKKO mice (Extended Data Fig.
10). Together, our results provide proof-of-principle that a decrease in endothelial-cell FAK
and a subsequent decrease in DNA-damage-induced NF-κB-dependent endothelial-cell
cytokine production controls tumour-cell chemosensitization.

Overall, our data indicate that, upon DNA damage, loss of endothelial-cell FAK is sufficient
to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapy by suppressing NF-κB activation and subsequent
cytokine production (Fig. 4d, e). These data establish a new concept in the regulation of
chemoresistance. Specifically, our data point to a role for endothelial-cell FAK in the
regulation of chemotherapy responses, and provide a starting point for the development of
new approaches to improve response to DNA-damaging therapies by specifically targeting
endothelial-cell FAK.

Methods
Mice
Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice14 were maintained on a mixed C57BL6/1 (ref. 14) background,
or on a pure C57 background for Eumyc experiments. Both male and female mice were
used, aged 6–24 weeks old.
Tumour growth, doxorubicin and irradiation treatment

Mouse melanoma (B16F0, ATCC; mycoplasma free) or mouse lung carcinoma (CMT19T,
CR-UK Cell Production; mycoplasma free) cells (1 × 106) were injected subcutaneously in
the flank of Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice and wild-type control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;nonfloxed or Fakfl/fl). Simultaneously, animals were given a soy-free diet (Harlan) to reduce
oestrogen levels and increase tamoxifen sensitivity. At days 7 and 8 after tumour
inoculation, once tumour growth had begun, all mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with 150 μl of 10 mg ml−1 of tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) diluted in10% ethanol in peanut oil
(Sigma) to induce endothelial-cell FAK deletion. From day 8 onwards, all animals were fed
with tamoxifen-containing diet (TAM400, Harlan). All animals with B16F0 subcutaneous

negative control on days 9, 11 and 13 after tumour-cell inoculation. Alternatively, animals
with subcutaneous CMT19T tumours were irradiated with 5Gy of γ-irradiation on day 10

Biopsy samples from non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients, either before (that is, at diagnosis)
or after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (that is, from relapsed patients), were analysed.
Formalin-fixed samples were de-waxed; rehydrated; blocked in 10% goat serum; incubated
in rabbit anti-FAK antibody (Cell Signaling, 3285) and mouse anti-human CD31 (Leica,
CD31-1A10-CE-S) in 0.5% goat serum in PBS overnight at 4 °C; incubated in biotinylated

serum in PBS; washed in PBS; and finally processed using streptavidin-HRP/fluorescein kit
(TSA Fluorescence Systems). The levels of endothelial-cell FAK were quantitated with
Image J software and the mean fluorescence intensity of FAK per pixel was measured.
Immunostaining
Sections of human lymphoma or mouse tumours were immunostained for endothelial cells
using either anti-PECAM antibody (MEC13.3; BD Biosciences, 553370) or rat antiendomucin (V.7C7;SantaCruz, SC-65495) in combination with either rabbit anti-FAK
antibody (Cell Signaling, 3285), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, 9661), rabbit antiKi67 (Abcam, AB15580), or rabbit anti-p65 subunit of NF-κB (D14E12; Cell Signaling,

Endothelial-cell culture

Author Manuscript

Primary mouse lung endothelial cells (MLECs) were isolated from Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl or
Pdgfb-iCreER; non-floxed adult mice as described previously28. After a negative sort with
rat anti-CD16/CD32 (Serotec, MCA2305EL), cells were immortalized with polyoma middle
T (PmT) virus by incubating them over 2 consecutive days for 4 h with supernatant from
GgP+E packaging cells29. Cells were grown in Mouse Lung Endothelial Cell Media28
supplemented with 500 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Two positive sorts using rat antiICAM2 (Serotec, MCA 2295EL) and sheep anti-rat IgG magnetic beads (Dynabeads) were
carried out as described previously28. Tamoxifen-treated endothelial cells isolated from
Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice gave rise to FAK-depleted endothelial cells (FAK-null) and
those isolated from Pdgfb-iCreER; non-floxed mice gave rise to FAK wild-type endothelial
cells.
Doxorubicin-induced cytokine production in vitro

Author Manuscript

Wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells were treated with 7.5 μg ml−1 mitomycin C
(Roche) for 2 h. After plating equal numbers of endothelial cells, cells were cultured for 24
h in full MLEC medium and then the medium was changed for MLEC medium
supplemented with 500 nM 4-OHT with, or without, 0.125 μM doxorubicin to generate
conditioned medium, which was collected after 48 h. The conditioned media from wild-type
and FAK-null endothelial cells were harvested and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to
remove cell debris before being added to B16F0 tumour cells, plated in 96-well plates. MTS
assessment of cell survival was carried out at 3 and 4 days as described later.
Irradiation-induced cytokine production in vitro

Author Manuscript

Wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells were treated with 7.5 μg ml−1 mitomycin C

24h and irradiated with 5Gy of X-rays using a RS2000 biological irradiator. Non-irradiated
wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells were used as controls. Cells were cultured for a
further 72 h with MLEC medium supplemented with 500 nM 4-OHT to generate
conditioned medium. The conditioned media from wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells

Conditioned media production from IκBαSR-transfected cells
Wild-type endothelial cells were transfected using the Nucleofector electroporation system
(Lonza) with either the empty vector (mock control) or IκBαSR. The next day, cells were
treated with 7.5 μg ml−1 mitomycin C for 2h (Sigma). Equal numbers of cells were plated in
complete medium supplemented with 4-OHT. After 24 h the medium was replaced by fresh
complete medium supplemented with 4-OHT ± 0.125 μM doxorubicin. This medium was
collected after 48 h incubation at 37 °C and applied to B16F0 cells and tumour-cell survival
was assessed using the MTS assay as described later.
MTS assay for tumour-cell survival

Immunostaining endothelial cells
Wild-type or FAK-null endothelial cells (4 × 104) were grown for 48h in MLEC medium
supplemented with 500 nM 4-OHT with or without 0.125 μM doxorubicin. Cells were then

Cytokine arrays

Author Manuscript

Wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells or transfected wild-type endothelial cells were
grown in normal MLEC media supplemented or not with 0.125 μM doxorubicin (Accord
Healthcare) or irradiated (5Gy). After 48 h of serum starvation, whole-cell lysates were
extracted at 48 h (for doxorubicin-treated endothelial cells) and 72 h (for irradiated
endothelial cells). Mouse cytokine arrays (Proteome Profiler ARY006, R&D Systems) were
processed according to the manufacturer's instructions using 100 μg of lysates (in 3% SDS,
60 mM sucrose, 65 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8) per membrane. Pixel analysis was used for
quantification with Image J software.

and left on ice for 5min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 500g the supernatants were
collected as cytosolic extracts. The pellets were washed once in hypotonic buffer, then
resuspended and sonicated in nuclear extraction buffer and centrifuged to remove debris.
The following antibodies were used for western blot analysis: anti-phospho-p65 NF-κB
(S536; Cell Signaling, 3033), anti-p65NF-κB (D14E12; Cell Signaling, 8242).
NF-κB activation assay

Wild-type and FAK-null cell lines were co-transfected with 2 μg each of the 3× kB ConA
NF-κB reporter firefly luciferase plasmid and an internal control plasmid expressing Renilla
luciferase (pRL-TK, Promega), using the Basic Endothelial Cell kit and T23 program on the
Nucleofector II (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were
treated with 0.125 μM of doxorubicin, and a further 48 h later cells were actively lysed with
Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and assayed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
system (Promega) in a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies)30. Results
shown are the mean plus s.e.m. of at east three independent experiments and were
normalized to the expression of the internal control plasmid. Statistical analysis was
performed using Prism 5 (GraphPad).
FAK immunostaining in mouse tumour sections

Author Manuscript

Tumours were fixed, paraffin embedded and processed as described earlier. For detection of
FAK, a rabbit anti-FAK antibody (Cell Signaling, 3285) was used. For FAK staining,
amplification of signal was achieved by incubating samples after the primary antibody
incubation with anti-rabbit biotinylated (DAKO, E0353) and anti-rat Alexa 546 (Invitrogen)
diluted 1:100 in 1% goat serum in PBS. After three washes in PBS, the sections were stained
with a streptavidin-HRP/fluorescein kit (TSA Fluorescence Systems).
Blood vessel density
Snap-frozen sections of tumours were immunostained for PECAM to detect blood vessels as
described earlier. Blood vessel density was calculated by counting the total number of blood
vessels across entire midline sections from age-matched, size-matched tumours. Blood
vessel density is presented as the number of blood vessels per mm2 of tumour section.
Blood vessel perfusion and permeability

Author Manuscript

Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106 B16F0 tumour
cells. At 7 and 8 days after tumour inoculation, all mice were injected i.p. with 150 μl of 10
mg ml−1 tamoxifen. From day 8 onwards, all mice were fed with tamoxifen containing diet.
On days 9,11 and 13 after tumour-cell inoculation, mice were injected with PBS. On day 14,
mice were injected with 100μl of PE-conjugated anti-PECAM antibody (Biolegend) via the
tail vein 10 min before killing the mice to analyse blood vessel perfusion. One minute before
mice were killed, they were also injected via the tail vein with Hoecsht dye (4μg ml−1) to
analyse blood vessel permeability. Tumours were dissected and immediately snap-frozen.
Cryosections were air-dried then fixed in −20 °C acetone for 10 min. Sections were then
rehydrated in PBS and washed once with water and mounted with Prolong Gold. The level

of blood vessel perfusion was calculated as the percentage of tumour blood vessels that were
positive for PE-PECAM over total blood vessel counts. Permeability was analysed by
counting the numbers of Hoecsht positive nuclei per field of view.
γH2AX immunostaining on mouse tumour sections
For mice used and treatment schedules see earlier. On day 14, tumours were removed and
snap-frozen. Cryosections were fixed in acetone for 10 min at −20 °C and rehydrated in PBS
for 10 min. Staining was performed using the M.O.M. Fluorescein kit (Vector Labs).
Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse phosphohistone
γH2AX (Ser 139) antibody (Millipore, clone JBW301). Nuclei of the tumour cells with
γH2AX foci were quantified as a percentage of total nuclei.
Doxorubicin delivery

Author Manuscript

Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice and wild-type control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed) were
given a subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 B16F0 cells, then treated with tamoxifen (as
described earlier) to generate ECFAKKO and ECFAKWT mice. To assess delivery of
doxorubicin to the tumours, mice were injected with 20 mg kg−1 doxorubicin over 1 min, 5
min before euthanasia. Under terminal an aesthesia mice were perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Perfused tumours were removed and fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde, then transferred to 70% ethanol. Tumours were embedded in paraffin,
sectioned, rehydrated and counter-stained with DAPI. Tumour sections were analysed using
the Zeiss Axioplan microscope and images were captured using Axiovision Rel.4 software.
Tumour hypoxia

Author Manuscript

For mice used and treatment schedules see earlier. On day 14, 1 h before mice were killed,
tumour-bearing mice were injected with 60 mg kg−1 pimonidazole hydrochloride
(HypoxyprobeTM-1 HPI, diluted in ddH2O to a final concentration of 10 mg ml−1)
intravenously via the tail vein. Tumours were processed immediately after cervical
dislocation. Cryosections were thawed, rehydrated and fixed for 10 min in −20 °C acetone
then incubated with 1:10 anti-pimonidazole antibody to identify hypoxic areas. Sections
were then washed and mounted with ProLong Gold with Antifade plus DAPI (Invitrogen,
P36930). Images were taken with a Zeiss microscope and Axioplan camera. The total
tumour area and pimonidazole-positive areas were measured using Axiovision Rel. 4
software (Zeiss). The percentage hypoxic area for each tumour section was then calculated.
CD45 infiltration

Author Manuscript

For mice used and treatment schedules see earlier. On day 14, tumours were harvested and
snap-frozen. Cryosections were fixed in acetone for 10 min at –20 °C; rehydrated in PBS for
10min; blocked in 5% goat serum diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature; washed once
in PBS; incubated overnight at 4°C with rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody (Serotec,
MCA1388) diluted 1:100 in 0.5% goat serum in PBS; washed three times in PBS; incubated
with anti-rat Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) for 1h at room temperature; washed in PBS and finally
mounted in ProLong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). CD45 was quantified as a percentage of
total DAPI area within five fields of view using a ×40 objective.

Experimental metastasis survival experiments

Author Manuscript

For experimental metastasis assays, 0.5 × 106 B16F10 and EumycBCL2 cells (obtained
from S. Hallam and T. Hagemann) were injected via the tail vein of Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl
mice and control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed). When tumours had grown, at either days
7 and 8 (for mice with B16F10) or days 10 and 11 (for EumycBCL2) after tumour-cell
inoculation, mice were given tamoxifen to induce endothelial-cell FAK deletion in PdgfbiCreER; Fakfl/fl but not Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed mice, generating ECFAKKO and
ECFAKWT mice, respectively. Mice were then treated with placebo or doxorubicin at days
12, 13 and 14 (for mice with B16F10) or days 11, 13 and 15 (for EumycBCL2) after
tumour-cell inoculation. Survival was recorded for each animal.
Phospho-STAT3 immunostaining

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice and wild-type control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed) were
given a subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 CMT19T tumour cells and the treatment schedule
was performed as described earlier. On day 10 after tumour-cell inoculation, mice were
irradiated, or not, with 5 Gy γ-irradiation. Tumours were harvested when they had reached
the maximum legal size allowed by the UK Home Office regulations, and snap-frozen
immediately. Cryosections were permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, followed
by one PBS wash. Slides were blocked (5% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS)
for 60min at room temperature then incubated with phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) (Cell
Signaling; 1:30 dilution in 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS) primary antibody overnight
at 4 °C. The slides were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescentconjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution in 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton-X 100 in PBS).
Slides were rinsed in PBS three times and once in water containing DAPI (1:10,000) and
then mounted with coverslips using Prolong Gold Anti-fade Reagent.
Endothelial apoptosis
Apoptosis was measured in tumour sections by double immunostaining for either cleaved
caspase 3 (CC3) or TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and PECAM.
Immunostaining was performed as described earlier. Endothelial apoptosis was calculated
by counting the percentage of tumour blood vessels that were also CC3-positive or TUNELpositive.
Primary endothelial-cell culture and nuclear translocation of p65

Author Manuscript

Wild-type and FAK-null primary endothelial cells were generated as described previously28.
Wild-type and FAK-null primary endothelial cells were grown for 24 h or 48 h with MLEC
supplemented with 500 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen with or without doxorubicin (0.125 μM or
0.25 μM). Immunostaining for p65 was performed as described earlier.
Cultured endothelial-cell FAK expression analysis
Endothelial cells were prepared as described earlier. For FAK detection, cells were fixed
with ice-cold acetone for 5 min at −20 °C. The fixed cells were then blocked for 30min at
room temperature in 5% goat serum in PBS and washed once with PBS, then incubated with
mouse anti-FAK antibody (77/FAK; BD Biosciences, 610088) diluted 1:100 in PBS. This

was followed by three washes in PBS and the cells were then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in PBS. After
three final washes in PBS the coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen).
Western blotting
Wild-type and FAK-null endothelial cells were grown and lysed under the same conditions
as described earlier. Anti-FAK (BD Biosciences) was used to detect FAK expression levels.
Western blot analysis was processed with 50 μg of total cell lysate as described
previously14. The following antibodies were used for western blot analysis of cytosolic
fractions: phospho-IκBα (S32, Cell Signaling, 2859), IκBα (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology,
sc-371).
GM-CSF and IL-6 intratumoral injections

Author Manuscript

B16F0 subcutaneous tumours were grown in Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice and wild- type
control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed), and given tamoxifen after tumour growth had
begun and treated with doxorubicin as described earlier. On days 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 after
tumour inoculation, half the animals were injected in tratumorally with 100 μl of either 15
ng ml−1 or 30 ng ml−1 of recombinant mouse GM-CSF or IL-6 diluted in PBS (PeproTech)
— concentrations that mimic the levels of wild-type endothelial-cell GM-CSF and IL-6
production. Controls were injected with 100 μl of PBS. Tumours were measured twice a
week and the animals were killed when tumours reached maximum legal size.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Results are presented as means ± s.e.m. for at least 2–3 independent experiments, unless
otherwise stated. The sample sizes used were based on level of changes and consistency
expected. Statistical significance was reported as appropriate. For animal experiments,
animals were excluded from the analysis if tumour volume breached the Home Office legal
size limit. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of the level of changes expected. No
randomization methods were used. During animal experiments the investigator was blinded
to the genotype of the animals under study. P values were calculated with the two-tailed
Student's t-test unless otherwise stated. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethical regulations
All animals were used according to the UK Home Office regulations. Human lymphoma
samples were obtained with signed informed consent from patients and Ethical Committee
approval.

Author Manuscript

a–c, Pdgfb-iCreER;Fakfl/fl mice and wild-type control mice (Pdgfb-iCreER;non-floxed) were
injected via the tail vein (intravenously) with either B16F10 melanoma cells (a, b) or
EumycBCL2 lymphoma cells (c) to establish experimental metastasis models. After tumour
growth was established endothelial-cell FAK deletion was induced, or not, by treatment of

ECFAKKO and ECFAKWT mice, respectively). Mice were then either treated with placebo
(a) or doxorubicin (b, c) and survival of the mice was recorded. Data show that endothelialcell FAK deletion, after tumour growth was established, had no effect on survival per se (a).
In contrast, in both the B16F10 and EumycBCL2 experimental metastasis assays, the
deletion of endothelial-cell FAK was sufficient to significantly extend median survival after
treatment with doxorubicin (b, c). Dashed lines represent median survival. Timelines for
