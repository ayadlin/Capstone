ABSTRACT
CD90 is used as a marker for cancer stem cell in liver cancer. We aimed to study
the mechanism by which CD90 promoted liver cancer progression and identify the
new therapeutic targets on CD90 signal pathway. Ectopic expression of CD90 in liver
cancer cell lines enhanced anchorage-independent growth and tumor progression.
Furthermore, CD90 promoted sphere formation in vitro and upregulated the
expression of the cancer stem cell marker CD133. The CD133 expression was higher
in CD45-CD90+ cells in liver cancer specimen. The natural carcinogenic molecules
TGF-β-1, HGF, and hepatitis B surface antigen increased the expression of CD90 and
CD133. Inhibition of CD90 by either shRNA or antibody attenuated the induction
of CD133 and anchorage-independent growth. Lentiviral delivery of CD133 shRNA
abolished the tumorigenicity induced by CD90. Ectopic expression of CD90 induced
mTOR phosphorylation and AMPK dephosphorylation. Mutation of integrin bindingRLD domain in CD90 attenuated the induction of CD133 and anchorage-independent
growth. Similar results were observed after silencing β3 integrin. Signaling analyses
revealed that AMPK/mTOR and β3 integrin were required for the induction of CD133
and tumor formation by CD90. Importantly, the energy restriction mimetic agent OSUCG5 reduced the CD90 population in fresh liver tumor sample and repressed the tumor
growth. In contrast, sorafenib did not decrease the CD90+ population. In conclusion,
the signal axis of CD90-integrin-mTOR/AMPK-CD133 is critical for promoting liver
carcinogenesis. Molecules inhibiting the signal axis, including OSU-CG5 and other
inhibitors, may serve as potential novel cancer therapeutic targets in liver cancer.

(HBV), transforming growth factor-β-1 (TGF-β-1), and

TGF-β-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlates
with hepatic carcinogenesis and tumor progression [1].
The serum levels of HGF are elevated in a variety of liver
diseases [2], and HGF concentrations are used as a tumor
marker for HCC [3]. In addition, the hepatitis B  virus

Liver cancer is a common cause of cancer-related
deaths around the world and is a result of the accumulation
of genetic and epigenetic alterations. There are several
etiological factors and potent stimulators involved
in liver cancer progression, such as hepatitis B virus

surface antigen is shown to promote tumor formation
[4]. A mutated HBV large surface protein with a deletion
in the antigen region has been found in the serum of
patients with HBV infection, and this protein enhances
anchorage-independent growth [5]. The etiologic agents
have been proposed to induce tumor progression through
the hierarchy model or the stochastic model (these models
are not mutually exclusive). In the stochastic model, the
instigating cells acquire a proliferative advantage over the
surrounding cells through the accumulation of multiple
genetic and epigenetic alterations, as demonstrated in the
development of colon cancer [6]. Alternatively, tumors
may develop according to the hierarchical model, which
proposes that a small population of cells within each
tumor has the ability to generate a tumor and recapitulate
the traits of a whole tumor [7]. These tumor-initiating
cells are called cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs generate
tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and
differentiation into multiple cell types; this hypothesis has
been supported by studies in which a small population of
leukemia cells had the ability to recapitulate the whole
tumor [8].
To identify cancer-initiating cells, scientists
generally separate the tumor cells into various
subpopulations using cell surface markers and examine
their tumor-forming ability in immunocompromised
mice [9, 10]. Several representative cell surface markers
have been identified from human hepatocarcinoma
cell lines and primary tissues [11, 12]. These
hepatocarcinoma CSC markers include CD133, CD90,
CD44, CD24, EpCAM, and OV6. CD133, also called
prominin 1, is a 5-transmembrane protein and a marker
of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Injection of as few
as 100 CD133+ brain tumor cells was found to form
tumors in xenotransplantation assays, whereas the same
number of CD133- cells was unable to generate tumors
[13]. In addition to brain cancer, CD133 was later
used to purify CSCs from several other tumor types
[14, 15]. Expression of CD133 enhances malignancy
by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 9. CD133 increases
the colony-formation ability and alters the cell cycle in
HCC [16]. The increased CD133 expression correlates
with poor prognosis in HCC [17]. CD133-positive HCC
cells possess a greater ability to grow in soft agar and
to form tumors in vivo than the corresponding CD133negative cells [18, 19]. The expression of CD133
is regulated by DNA methylation. TGF-β-1 induces
CD133 expression through the inhibition of DNMT1
and DNMT3β, and this inhibition is partially dependent
on the SMAD pathway [20]. Yang et al. identify CSCs
from HCC cell lines and primary HCC tissues that are
defined by the expression of the hepatic progenitor
marker OV6 and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[21]. Gene expression and signaling pathway analyses
on HCC specimens reveal that cells positive for the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

surface hepatic stem cell marker EpCAM have features
of cancer stem cells [22]. Because some CD133+ cells
are representative of CSCs, further identification and
characterization reveal that CSCs could be better defined
by co-expression of CD133 and CD44 on the cell surface
[23]. In contrast, the number of cells expressing CD90
(Thy1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored
glycoprotein, is correlated with the tumorigenicity
of HCC cell lines. The CD90+CD44+ cells possess a
more aggressive and metastatic phenotype than the
CD90+CD44− cells [24]. The function of CD90 may be
dependent on cell type; activation of CD90 induces the
activation and translocation of FasL via the src family
kinases in lung myofibroblasts [25]. A decrease in CD90
expression has been observed in nasopharyngeal cell
lines and in 65% of tumor samples. Restoration of CD90
expression causes a decrease in colony formation [26].
CD90 has an RGD-like sequence, RLD, and it binds
to ανβ3 integrin through its RLD sequence, thereby
activating the interaction between melanoma cells and
activated endothelial cells [27–29]. The binding of
CD90 to ανβ5 integrin is RLD-dependent because the
mutated form, CD90-RLE, loses the ability to bind to
the integrin on lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, the liver
cancer stem cells have been classified as two groups
with EpCAM or CD90 [30].
Targeted therapy is one type of cancer treatment
that uses drugs to more precisely attack cancer cells.
The drug development for targeted therapy is usually
based on the specific mutation or dysregulated signaling
pathway in cancer. Several signaling pathways, including
the MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, STAT3, VEGFR
and PDGFR pathway, are demonstrated to promote
cancer progression [31, 32]. Sorafenib inactivates ERK
and mTOR signaling pathway and suppresses the tu­
mor formation [33]. The combination of sorafenib and
PKI-587 drives the inhibition of proliferation in liver
cancer [34]. Recently, studies have indicated that cancerinitiating cells may benefit from the abundant expression
of CD44 [35]. Cancer stem cell marker is not only used
to define specific populations of cancer cells, but also
correlates with tumor growth. Therefore, we aimed to
study whether CD90 CSC marker and its downstream
signaling pathway play an important role in tumor growth.
In this report, we demonstrate that abundantly expressed
CD90 increases sphere formation, soft agar growth, and
tumorigenicity in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. In addition,
CD90 enhances the expression of CD133 via the AMPK
and mTOR pathways. The binding of CD90 to integrin
through the RLD residues is essential for the induction
of CD133 and soft agar growth. The reduction in CD133
expression attenuates the induction of soft agar growth by
CD90. Our results demonstrate that the CD90-integrinAMPK-CD133 signal axis is essential for the growth of
liver cancer. Therapeutics targeting the signal axis may be
useful for liver cancer treatment.

RESULTS

TGF-β-1 induced the expression of CD133 in HepG2
and Hep3B cells, and the expression of CD133 was
significantly reduced by the introduction of CD90 shRNA
(Figure 3A and 3B). The knockdown efficacy induced by
CD90 shRNA in HepG2 and Hep3B cell was analyzed
using quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 3C). Our previous
report has indicated that HBV pre-S2 large surface
protein induces a variety of pathologic conditions in the
hepatocarcinoma HuH7 cell [5]. The pre-S2 mutant gene
with a deletion of pre-S2 region of large surface protein
(ΔS2-LHBs) contains a deletion at nucleotides 4–57.
ΔS2-LHBs is clustered in the hepatocyte with hepatitis
B virus infection and involved in the tumorigenesis. The
expression of CD133 and CD90 in HuH7 transfectants
expressing wild-type LHBs and ΔS2-LHBs was analyzed
by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 3D and 3E). Furthermore,
the induction of CD133 by the expression of the HBV
large surface protein was attenuated by CD90 shRNA
(Figure 3F and 3G). Finally, anchorage-independent
growth of HBV-preS2 cells was abolished by shRNA or
antibody against CD90 (Figure 3H). To further confirm
the effect of CD90 shRNA in liver cancer, the lentiviral
particles containing CD90 shRNA was delivered to
liver cancer PLC/PRF/5 cells. The CD133 expression
and anchorage-independent growth in the PLC/PRF/5
cell were attenuated by CD90 shRNA (Supplementary
Figure S2A and S2B). Taken together, the results indicate
that CD90 is essential for the induction of CD133 by
physiological stimuli (HGF and TGF-β-1) or pathological
alteration (the HBV large surface protein).

CD90 promotes tumorigenicity in HepG2,
Hep3B and HuH7 cells
To determine whether the CD90 cancer stem cell
marker is involved in the tumorigenesis of liver cancer
cell, HepG2, Hep3B and HuH7 cells were transfected with
a plasmid encoding CD90. Ectopic expression of CD90
mRNA was detected by RT-PCR analysis, and surface
expression of CD90 was verified by flow cytometry
analysis (Figure 1A and 1B, Supplementary Figure
S1A and S1B). Ectopic expression of CD90 increased
anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor
formation in vivo (Figure 1C and 1D, Supplementary
Figure S1C and S1D). Furthermore, the expression of
CD90 in the stable transfectants was comparable to the
expression of CD90 in the liver tumor samples, suggesting
that the phenotype was not due to artificial overexpression
in cell lines (Figure 1E).

CD90 increases sphere-forming ability and the
expression of stem cell marker CD133
Ectopic expression of CD90 enhanced sphere
formation in ultra-low attachment culture dishes, a
capability that is one of the characteristics of cancer
stem cells (Figure 2A). The expression of CD133 was
dramatically enhanced by the ectopic expression of CD90
(Figure 2B). The expression of other stem cell markers,
including CD44, EpCAM, and CD13, was not statistically
different between the HepG2 CD90 transfectants and the
parental cells (Figure 2B). In contrast, the expression of
CD24 was higher in the CD90 transfectants (Figure 2B).
The elevated expression of CD133 was further confirmed
by western blotting (Figure 2C). Taken together, the
results indicate that the expression of CD133 and CD24
are induced by the ectopic expression of CD90. CD133
is a CSC marker in many types of cancer, implicating
its significance of cancer development. To confirm
the upregulation of CD133 in vivo, we analyzed the
expression of CD133 in tumor cells from clinical HCC
samples. The CD45- population was used to exclude the
effects from CD45+ cells. The expression of CD133 in
the CD45-CD90+ tumor cells was higher than that in
the CD45-CD90- tumor cells isolated from clinical HCC
specimens (Figure 2D).

Inhibition of CD133 abolishes the tumor growth
induced by CD90
Since overexpression of CD90 induced the
expression of CD133 and anchorage-independent
growth, we investigated whether CD133 was essential
for the anchorage-independent growth induced by CD90.
Lentiviral introduction of CD133 shRNA was used to
inhibit CD133 expression (Figure 4A). Two different
CD133 shRNAs significantly suppressed the anchorageindependent growth induced by CD90 in HepG2 and
Hep3B CD90 transfectants (Figure 4B). Treatment with
a monoclonal anti-CD133 antibody (AC133) also blocked
the anchorage-independent growth induced by CD90 in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Figure 4C), excluding the
off-target effects of CD133 shRNA in general. Finally,
lentiviral introduction of shCD133 in vivo inhibited tumor
growth (Figure 4D). Thus, CD133 is required for the
CD90-induced tumor progression.

investigated whether the mTOR and AMPK pathways
contributes to the expression of CD133 induced by
ectopic expression of CD90. HepG2 and Hep3B CD90
transfectants had higher levels of mTOR phosphorylation
and lower levels of AMPK phosphorylation than the
parental cells or control transfectants (Figure 5A). In
contrast, the PLC/PRF/5 cells infected with lentiviral
particles containing CD90 shRNA had lower levels of
mTOR phosphorylation and higher levels of AMPK
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S2C). To further
determine whether mTOR and AMPK were essential for
the upregulation of CD133 by CD90, we determined the
effects of rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) and AICAR (an
AMPK activator) on the expression of CD133 in the CD90
transfectants. CD133 mRNA and protein upregulation
were attenuated upon rapamycin or AICAR treatment
in HepG2 and Hep3B CD90 transfectants (Figure 5B
and 5C). Furthermore, the increase of the anchorageindependent growth in CD90 transfectants was restored by
rapamycin or AICAR (Figure 5D). An energy restriction
mimetic agent OSU-CG5 has been demonstrated to
inhibit mTOR pathway [38, 39]. We therefore examined
the effect of OSU-CG5 on the CD90-induced anchorageindependent growth. The OSU-CG5 selectively inhibited
the growth and the mTOR phosphorylation of HepG2
CD90 transfectants and Hep3B CD90 transfectants
(Supplementary Figure S3A). OSU-CG5 had a comparable
killing effect with sorafenib on the parental HepG2 and
Hep3B cells (Supplementary Figure S3B), and selectively
reduced CD90 population in Hep3B cells (Supplementary
Figure S3C). Importantly, OSU-CG5 alone significantly
abolished tumor growth in animal tumor model, but did
not grossly decrease the weight for mice, an indication
for health condition (Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure
S3D). Finally, we determined whether OSU-CG5 can
specifically eradicate the CD90-positive population in
clinical tumor samples. OSU-CG5 had the killing effect on
tumor cells and decreased the CD90-positive population
in the fresh liver tumors (Figure 5F and 5G). In contrast,
sorafenib, an inhibitor mainly works on ERK pathway
[40], did not suppress the CD90-positive population
cells (Figure 5G). Compared to the sorafenib, OSU-CG5
significantly inhibited the CD45-CD90+ populations
from clinical tumor samples (Figure 5H). Altogether, the
CD90-AMPK/mTOR-CD133 signal axis is required for
hepatocarcinogenesis. OSU-CG5 was able to decrease
the CD45-CD90+ tumor cells, which were potentially a
population of liver cancer stem cells.

signal transduction in regulating CD133 expression. The
RLD residue of CD90 was replaced with RLE, and the
mutant CD90 was transfected into HepG2 and Hep3B
cells. Neither anchorage-independent growth nor CD133
mRNA expression was induced by the CD90 RLE mutant
(Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). The alteration on
AMPK phosphorylation and mTOR phosphorylation was
attenuated in the cell lines expressing CD90 RLE mutant
(Supplementary Figure S4C).

Silencing of β3 Integrin decreases tumor
formation and CD133 expression
Integrins recognize arginine-glycin-aspartic acid
(RGD) sequence and contribute to the cancer cell growth.
The RGD-like sequence, RLD, also binds to integrin and
participates in the signaling transduction. We sought to
identify the effect of integrin family in CD90 transfectant.
The lentiviral particles containing αV, β1, and β5 integrin
shRNA was delivered into CD90 transfectant, respectively.
The integrin shRNA-induced knockdown efficacy in
HepG2 and Hep3B CD90 transfectant was analyzed by
quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S5A). The
CD133 expression and anchorage-independent growth
ability were not consistently inhibited by αV, β1, and
β5 integrin shRNA (Supplementary Figure S5B and
S5C). Given the effects of RLD domain of CD90 in
CD133 expression and the colocalization of CD90 and
β3 integrin [42], we next determined whether β3 integrin
contributes to the CD90-induced phenotype in HepG2
and Hep3B cells. We delivered CD90 transfectants with
integrin shRNA to silence β3 integrin (Figure 6A), and
determined the expression level of CD133 and anchorageindependent growth. The expression of CD133 was
reduced by β3 integrin shRNA (Figure 6B). CD90induced phosphorylation of mTOR and AMPK were
attenuated after the inhibition of β3 integrin (Figure 6C).
Anchorage-independent growth was decreased in a similar
fashion (Figure 6D). Anti-β3 integrin antibody effectively
decreased the anchorage-independent growth induced
by CD90 (Figure 6D). Co-incubation of tumor cells
with lentiviral particles containing β3 integrin shRNA
dramatically inhibited the tumor formation in mice
(Figure 6E). In a therapeutic model, the lentiviral particles
were delivered at 24 days after tumor implantation.
Lentiviral expression of β3 integrinshRNA inhibited tumor
growth (Supplementary Figure S6A). These data indicate
that CD90 activates mTOR and AMPK to promote
anchorage-independent growth via binding to β3 integrin.

competes the binding to latent TGF-β-1 complex, thereby
inhibiting the contraction-iduced latent TGF-β-1 activation
on myofibroblast differentiation and lung fibrosis [41].
On the other hand, CD90 binds to αvβ3 integrin in trans
by syndecan-4 and leads to focal adhesion formation in
melanoma invasion [49]. The tyrosine phosphorylation
and focal adhesion formation in astrocyte are induced
by thymoma expressing CD90 [50]. CD90 expressed
on endothelium functions as a ligand for ανβ3 integrin
expressed on melanoma and the interaction between
ανβ3 integrin and CD90 in trans is correlated with the
metastasis [27]. Furthermore, CD90 represents a counter
receptor for leukocyte integrin Mac-1 and has the ability to
bind the monocyte and PMNC (polymorphonuclear cell)

(Supplementary Figure S4). It will be important to study
whether there is a trans-interaction between CD90 on
liver cancer cell and the molecules on neighboring cells in
hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
CD133 is expressed in many cancers, such as liver
cancer, colon cancer, and brain gliomas [13, 14, 19].
Previous studies have also supported the notion that
CD133 plays an oncogenic role in cancer. Overexpression
of CD133 induces tumorigenicity in HEK293 cells
[52], and CD133 is a potential oncogene in head and
neck cancer [53]. The downregulation of CD133 by an
HDAC6 inhibitor inhibits cancer cell differentiation [54].
Therefore, targeting CD133 and its related signaling
pathways may be a feasible strategy for treating cancer.
In summary, our report indicates that the CD90integrin-AMPK/mTOR-CD133 signal axis is required
for hepatocarcinogenesis. We further provide evidences
to support a new therapeutic approach by inhibiting the
signal axis pathway between cancer stem cell markers.

HGF, TGF-β-1, and mutant HBV large surface protein,
induce the expression of CD90 and CD133. The expression
of CD133 is higher in CD90-positive cells than that in
CD90-negative fresh tumor cells. Signaling analyses
reveal that AMPK/mTOR and β3 integrin are required
for the induction of CD133 by CD90. Importantly, the
tumorigenicity of cancer cells can be blocked by shRNA
or antibody targeting CD90, β3 integrin, and CD133.
Finally, energy restriction mimetic agent OSU-CG5
effectively decreases the cells expressing CD90 and tumor
growth. A  scheme of signal axis of CD90 and CD133
and therapeutic opportunities is illustrated in Figure 6F.
In accordance to our results, sorafenib is unable to induce
apoptotic response on CD44+ cells in liver cancer [43].
This report suggests that therapy targeting signal axis of
CD90 and CD133 may be combined with current therapy,
such as sorafenib, in treating liver cancer.
Hepatic cancer stem cells have been identified
by several markers [44, 45], including EpCAM, CD90,
CD133, CD44, CD24, and CD13. CD133 is co-expressed
with many other markers that are used to define liver
cancer stem cells [23, 46]; thus, it is logical to hypothesize
that there is a correlation between these markers. Our
results demonstrated that ectopic expression of CD90
induced the expression of liver cancer stem cell markers,
including CD133, CD24, and EpCAM. Our result
provided the first evidence that expression of these stem
cell markers are influenced by each other, which will be
important for us to study the difference and lineage of
cancer stem cells. For example, CD90 mainly induced the
expression of CD133 and CD24, but had little effect on
the expression of CD13. The correlation between these
cancer stem cell markers provides a novel strategy to treat
cancer. In this report, inhibitors targeting CD90-integrinAMPK/mTOR-CD133 are effective in attenuating tumor
progression. A recent study also indicates that CD24
contributes to the urothelial tumorigenesis and metastasis
[47]. Therefore, targeting these cancer stem cell markers
may be a general strategy for cancer treatment. CD90positive cancer stem cell population is reported to have a
characteristic of pro-glycolysis gene expression signature
[48]. We have examined the therapeutic molecule OSUCG5 which mainly targets glucose transporter and
decreases energy sensing pathway. Sorafenib is better
than OSU-CG5 in inhibiting cell growth. However, OSUCG5 selectively decreased the CD90-positive cells which
are potentially represented as cancer initiating cells.
Therefore, combination of OSU-CG5 and sorafenib may
provide a novel therapy for liver cancer.
Ectopic expression of mutant RLE CD90 did not
affect mTOR phosphorylation, CD133 expression, and
anchorage-independent growth. These results suggest
that the binding of CD90 to integrin in cis is required for
enhancing tumor formation. The cis binding of CD90 to
integrin was also observed in the previous study describ­
ing the correlation between CD90 and ανβ5 integrin in
