Abstract
Side population (SP) cell analysis and sorting have been
successfully applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell
lines to identify a minor cell population with cancer stem cell
properties. However, the molecular mechanisms operating in
SP cells remain unclear. The polycomb gene product BMI1
plays a central role in the self-renewal of somatic stem cells in
a variety of tissues and organs and seems to be implicated in
tumor development. In this study, we determined the critical
role of BMI1 in the maintenance of cancer stem cells with the
SP phenotype in HCC cell lines. BMI1 was preferentially
expressed in SP cells in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 HCC cells
compared with the corresponding non-SP cells. Lentiviral
knockdown of BMI1 considerably decreased the number of SP
cells in both Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells. Long-term culture of
purified SP cells resulted in a drastic reduction in the SP
subpopulation upon the BMI1 knockdown, indicating that
BMI1 is required for the self-renewal of SP cells in culture.
More importantly, the BMI1 knockdown abolished the tumorinitiating ability of SP cells in nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficiency mice. Derepression of the
INK4A and ARF genes that are major targets for BMI1 was
not necessarily associated with impaired self-renewal of SP
cells caused by BMI1 knockdown. In conclusion, our findings
define an important role for BMI1 in the maintenance of
tumor-initiating SP cells in HCC. BMI1 might be a novel
therapeutic target for the eradication of cancer stem cells in
HCC. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7742–9]

Introduction
According to the recent ‘‘cancer stem cell hypothesis,’’ tumors
consist of a minor component of tumorigenic cells and a major
component of nontumorigenic cells (1, 2). The minor population,
termed cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells, construct a
hierarchical structure containing varied descendants in a similar
fashion to the normal stem cell systems and possesses a prominent

ability to initiate new tumors in xenograft transplantation (3, 4). In
addition, these cells seem to be highly resistant to traditional forms
of anticancer therapy such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy
(5, 6), resulting in residual cancer stem cells which, in many
instances, lead to the recurrence of the cancer (7). Therefore, an
overall understanding of the various biological aspects of cancer
stem cells is of paramount importance to both the elucidation of
mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and the establishment of
novel therapeutic strategies.
Side population (SP) cell analysis and sorting were initially
used for the isolation of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow
cells (8). Currently, they are widely applied to the enrichment of
putative normal stem cells in a variety of tissues and organs
(9–11). The SP phenotype is determined by the ability to efflux
the Hoechst 33342 dye through an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
membrane transporter. Of note, recent studies showed that SP
cells isolated from diverse cancer cell lines harbor stem cell–like
properties (12–14). Given that many different types of cancer cells
frequently show overexpression of ABC transporters and exhibit
drug resistance (15), it is quite reasonable to detect stem-like
fractions in cancer cells using this approach. We previously
applied SP analysis and sorting to established hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and found that in Huh7 and PLC/
PRF/5 cells, SP fractions made up <1% of the total cell population
(12). As expected, the SP subpopulations showed cancer stem
cell–like properties both in culture and in an in vivo transplant
model. These stem cell biology-based strategies enabled us to
perform further analyses.
We and others previously reported that the polycomb-group
(PcG) gene Bmi1 plays a critical role in the self-renewal of a range
of somatic stem cells, including hepatic stem cells, based on gainof-function and loss-of-function analyses (16, 17). It seems likely
that both normal and cancer stem cells share not only a number of
surface marker phenotypes but also a list of molecular mechanisms
for self-renewal and differentiation. This has been well shown in
the leukemic stem cell system (18–20), although little is known in
solid cancers.
In the current study, we examined the crucial role of BMI1 in the
maintenance of the tumor-initiating SP subpopulation in HCC
cells. Taking advantage of lentivirus-mediated knockdown and
retrovirus-mediated overexpression techniques, we examined
whether BMI1 regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of SP
cells in culture and their tumorigenicity in a nonobese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) xenograft transplant model.

Materials and Methods
Mice. NOD/SCID mice were purchased from Sankyo Laboratory Co. Ltd.
They were bred and maintained in accordance with our institutional
guidelines for the use of laboratory animals.
Cell culture. The human liver cancer cell lines Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5
were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen Life Technologies) containing 10% FCS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Flow cytometry. SP analysis and sorting were performed, as described
previously (12). Briefly, the suspended cells were incubated at 37jC for 90
min with 20 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Chemical), either alone or in the
presence of 50 Amol/L verapamil (Sigma). For the analysis of CD133
expression, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated CD133/1
(Miltenyi Biotec). Propidium iodide (BD PharMingen) was added for the
elimination of dead cells. Cell analysis and sorting were performed using
MoFlo (DakoCytomation).
Immunocytochemistry. Freshly isolated SP cells and non-SP cells were
placed on poly-L-lysine–coated slide glasses. After fixation with 2%
paraformaldehyde and blocking in 10% goat serum, the cells were incubated
with 0.5% Triton-X in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After
incubation, the cells were stained with a primary antibody, anti-Bmi1
(F6; Upstate Biotechnology), at a dilution of 1:200 for 12 h at 4jC. The cells
then were washed and incubated with Alexa-555–conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:500 for 2 h at room
temperature. After being washed in PBS, the cells were coverslipped with a
mounting medium containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector
Laboratories).
Viral production and transduction. Lentiviral vectors (CS-H1-shRNAEF-1a-EGFP) expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets human
BMI1 (target sequence: sh-BMI1 -1, 5¶-CAGATGAAGATAAGAGAAT-3¶;

www.aacrjournals.org

sh-BMI1-2, 5¶-GAGAAGGAATGGTCCACTT-3¶) and luciferase were constructed. Human BMI1 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Kazuhito Yamamoto) was
cloned into a site upstream of IRES–enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) in the pMCs-IG retroviral vector (21). Recombinant lentiviruses and
retroviruses were produced as described before (17, 22).
Western blotting. Cells transduced with the indicated viruses were
selected by cell sorting for EGFP expression and subjected to Western blot
analysis using anti-Bmi1 (F6) and anti–a-tubulin (Ab-1; Oncogene Science)
antibodies.
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
were conducted, as described previously (12). Real-time PCR was performed
using TaqMan technology and the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probe and primers for BMI1 (assay
ID Hs00180411_m1) and b-actin (assay ID Hs99999903_m1) were obtained
from TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). To examine the
mRNA expression of INK4A/ARF genes in SP cells following BMI1
knockdown, multiplex reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) was performed
as described previously (23). PCR for BMI1 and b-actin was conducted
using the following primers: BMI1 ( forward 5¶-AGC AGC AAT GAC TGT
GAT GC-3¶, reverse 5¶-CAG TCT CAG GTA TCA ACC AG-3¶), b-actin
( forward 5¶-ATC CTG CGT CTG GAC CTG GCT GG-3¶, reverse 5¶-ACA TGC
CGG AGC CGT TGT CGA CGA-3¶).
Xenograft transplantation. Various numbers of SP and non-SP cells
stably expressing shRNA against BMI1 or luciferase were suspended in
DMEM and Matrigel (Becton Dickinson; 1:1) and transplanted to NOD/
SCID mice (male, 6–10 wk) under anesthesia. BMI1 knockdown cells and
control cells were implanted into the s.c. space on the right and left sides of
the back of recipient mice, respectively. To examine whether enforced
expression of BMI1 in SP cells promotes tumorigenesis, 1  104 Huh7 SP
cells transduced with BMI1 and EGFP retroviruses were also transplanted.

Tumor formation was observed weekly for 14 wk. The transplantation
assays were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines for the
use of laboratory animals.
Immunohistochemical analysis. The subcutaneous tumors formed in
NOD/SCID mice were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The
sections were subjected to H&E staining. For dual immunohistochemical
analyses, the sections were stained with anti-EGFP (BD Biosciences
Clontech) and anti-BMI1 (F6), followed by incubation with Alexa-488–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-555–conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes), respectively.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the means F SE. Statistical
differences between two groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney
units test. P values <0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Preferential expression of BMI1 in SP cells. To gain insight
into the crucial role of the polycomb gene product BMI1, we first
examined the basal expression of BMI1 in the SP population in
Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells. Real-time RT-PCR analyses showed
that the mRNA expression of BMI1 was 4.10 F 0.36-fold and 1.92 F
0.25-fold higher in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 SP cells than in the
corresponding non-SP cells, respectively (Fig. 1A and C). Immunocytochemical analyses confirmed that BMI1 is highly expressed
in the nuclei of SP cells rather than the corresponding non-SP cells
in both cell lines (Fig. 1B and D).
Stable knockdown of BMI1 by shRNA. We next performed
loss-of-function analyses of BMI1 in vitro. Stable knockdown of
BMI1 in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells was achieved by lentivirusmediated delivery of shRNA against BMI1. A lentiviral vector
expressing shRNA against luciferase was used as a control. We

obtained stable cell lines expressing shRNA against BMI1 or
luciferase by cell sorting using EGFP as a marker for infection.
Western blot analysis showed that both sh-BMI1-1 and sh-BMI1-2
markedly repressed BMI1 expression in both cell lines, although shBMI1-1 was less effective than sh-BMI1-2 (Fig. 2A). Both shRNA
inhibited the growth of HCC cell lines. In good agreement with the
Western blot data, sh-BMI1-2 was more effective in growth
suppression than sh-BMI1-1 (Fig. 2B and C). The viability of cells
expressing shRNA against BMI1 was comparable with that of
control cells (data not shown).
Detection and isolation of SP cells. SP cell analysis and sorting
were performed in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells stably expressing
shRNA against BMI1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). BMI1
knockdown using sh-BMI1-2 considerably decreased the size of the
SP population from 0.67 F 0.09% to 0.19 F 0.03% in Huh7 cells
and from 0.87 F 0.10% to 0.40 F 0.04% in PLC/PRF/5 cells
(Fig. 3). On the other hand, BMI1 knockdown using sh-BMI1-1
slightly decreased the percentage of SP cells from 0.59 F 0.04% to
0.32 F 0.03% in Huh7 cells and from 0.82 F 0.06% to 0.47 F 0.03%
in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). The SP population
showed a drastic reduction in number on treatment with the
calcium channel blocker verapamil.
Stable overexpression of BMI1 by retroviral vector. Next,
we tested the overexpression of BMI1 in HCC cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). In clear contrast with the knockdown experiment, the SP
subpopulation increased nearly 8-fold with the overexpression of
BMI1 in Huh7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Next, we examined
the tumorigenicity of Huh7 SP cells transduced with BMI1 in NOD/
SCID xenograft transplantation. The implantation of 1  104 SP
cells transduced with BMI1 resulted in early onset and aggressive

tumor growth compared with that of control SP cells expressing
EGFP (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). These results indicated that
forced expression of BMI1 leads to not only enhanced self-renewal
but also increased tumorigenicity of SP cells.
Expression of the INK4A/ARF gene in BMI1 knockdown SP
cells. To address whether the knockdown of BMI1 causes
derepression of the INK4A and ARF genes as observed in Bmi1deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; ref. 17), we examined
their mRNA expression in SP cells freshly isolated from BMI1
knockdown and control cells (Fig. 4A). In Huh7 SP cells, in which
INK4A expression is repressed by aberrant DNA methylation in its
promoter region (23) and ARF is constitutively expressed,
BMI1 knockdown did not affect their expression at all. Conversely,
BMI1 knockdown in PLC/PRF/5 SP cells, in which both INK4A
and ARF are moderately expressed, greatly augmented their
expression.
Reanalysis of isolated SP cells. We have previously reported
that purified SP cells self-renew and generate nontumorigenic nonSP cells through asymmetrical cell division in vivo (12). Purified SP
cells repopulate the same hierarchical structure as the original
tumor cells consisting of a minor component of SP cells and a
major component of non-SP cells (12, 24). This process occurs both
in vitro and in vivo. The SP cells in repopulated tumor retain the
same tumor-initiating capacity as the original SP cells. We purified
SP cells from both BMI1 knockdown and control cells and cultured
them for 4 weeks to examine the role of BMI1 in this process in
culture. The SP subpopulation in BMI1 knockdown Huh7 cells
profoundly decreased (5.5%) compared with that in the control
cells (18.8%; Fig. 4B). Likewise, the percentage of PLC/PRF/5 SP
cells among BMI1 knockdown and control cells was 6.1% and
22.0%, respectively (Fig. 4B). These results imply that BMI1
regulates the self-renewal capability of tumor-initiating SP cells

www.aacrjournals.org

and loss of BMI1 accelerates differentiation toward nontumorigenic non-SP cells.
The role for BMI1 in the maintenance of tumorigenic
CD133-positive Huh7 cells. It has been reported that CD133positive cells possessed greater tumorigenicity than CD133negative cells in HCC cells, including Huh7 cells (25). Although
the majority of Huh7 cells are CD133-positive (Fig. 4C), it has
been shown that CD133 expression is stronger in SP cells than
in non-SP cells (24). We then evaluated the expression of CD133
in the context of BMI1 expression using flow cytometry. BMI1
knockdown decreased the CD133-positive fraction from 74.2% to
60.9%, whereas BMI1 overexpression increased it from 71.6% to
84.4% (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that the expression
level of BMI1 is tightly correlated with the cancer stem cell
phenotype represented not only by SP cells but also by CD133positive cells.
Tumorigenic ability in xenograft transplantation. To determine whether loss of BMI1 affects the tumorigenicity in vivo,
various numbers of SP and non-SP cells sorted from the BMI1
knockdown or control HCC cells were transplanted into NOD/SCID
mice (Fig. 5; Table 1). As few as 1  103 control SP cells were
enough to initiate tumors for both cell lines. In contrast, 1  103
BMI1 knockdown SP cells transduced with sh-BMI1-1 and 1  104
BMI1 knockdown SP cells transduced with sh-BMI1-2 from Huh7
and PLC/PRF/5 cells failed to initiate subcutaneous tumors in any
recipient mice. Tumors derived from control SP cells showed
similar histologic features to those formed by the injection of
unsorted cells and exhibited the nuclear expression of BMI1
(Fig. 5). Unexpectedly, 1  105 BMI1 knockdown Huh7 and PLC/
PRF/5 SP cells with sh-BMI1-2 gave rise to tumors in one of
three and one of two mice, respectively. However, the tumor size
was less than half that of control SP cells. Furthermore,

immunohistochemical analyses revealed that tumors predominantly consisted of contaminating EGFP-negative cells or EGFPpositive cells showing no obvious effects of BMI1 knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S3). By contrast, tumors derived from control
SP cells did not contain EGFP-negative cells at all (Fig. 5). These
results further support that the tumor-initiating capacity is
profoundly impaired by BMI1 knockdown. In contrast, the injection
of 1  106 non-SP cells from either cell line failed to generate
tumors in any mice.

Discussion
PcG proteins form chromatin-associated multiprotein complexes, polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 and
function as a cellular memory system through epigenetic
chromatin modifications (26, 27). Bmi1, a component of PRC1,
has been implicated in the regulation of self-renewal in a range of
different stem cell systems (28, 29). Of note, Bmi1 is also required

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

for the maintenance of self-renewing leukemic stem cells in a
mouse model using Bmi1 / HSCs (30). Recent reports described
that BMI1 is preferentially expressed in the tumorigenic subpopulation in breast cancer and head and neck tumors (31, 32).
Consistent with these reports, we previously showed that forced
expression of BMI1 promotes the self-renewal of hepatic stem/
progenitor cells and contributes to malignant transformation (16).
In addition, immunohistochemical analyses showed BMI1 to be
overexpressed in >60% of human HCC cases examined.6 Together,
all these findings highlight the importance of BMI1 in hepatocarcinogenesis and implicate BMI1 in the self-renewal of cancer stem
cells in HCC.
In the present study, we first examined the basal expression of
BMI1 in Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 SP cells. As expected, both the real-

BMI1 Contributes to the Maintenance of SP Cells in HCC

time RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analyses showed BMI1
expression to be stronger in SP cells than non-SP cells in each cell
line. We thus directly evaluated the role of BMI1 in cancer stem
cell–like SP cells. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of BMI1
allowed a highly efficient loss-of-function assay of the SP
subpopulation in culture and in an in vivo transplant model. The
analysis showed a significant decrease in the frequency of SP cells
among the BMI1 knockdown cells compared with the corresponding
control cells. Furthermore, analysis of the growth and differentiation
of purified SP cells revealed that loss of BMI1 causes a considerable
decrease in the SP subpopulation and facilitates differentiation
toward non-SP cells. These results indicated that BMI1 contributes
to the self-renewal of SP cells in culture.
Notably, when as few as 1  103 control SP cells were sufficient
to initiate tumors in NOD/SCID mice, even 10 times more BMI1
knockdown SP cells (1  104) failed to develop tumors. 1  105
BMI1 knockdown SP cells gave increase to tumors in some of the
recipient mice, but the tumor-initiating capacity was profoundly
reduced. Collectively, the tumorigenic activity in the SP subpopulation seemed to be attenuated nearly 100-fold by the BMI1
knockdown. Although the important role of Bmi1 in the
maintenance of cancer stem cells has already been shown in a
mouse leukemia model, this is the first direct evidence that the loss
of BMI1 in established cancer stem cells can affect their ability to
self-renew and tumorigenicity. The role of BMI1 in the regulation of
tumor-initiating SP cells was further supported by the findings of
the gain-of-function assay. Although stable knockdown of BMI1
decreased SP cell numbers in vitro, it did not completely abolish SP
cells and its effect varied among HCC cell lines. These results

strongly indicate that the SP subpopulation is quite heterogeneous,
and the contribution of BMI1 to the SP phenotype differs among
the cell lines. Considering that BMI1 is just one of multiple selfrenewal regulators, the different contributions of molecular
machinery, including the Notch, Wnt, and Shh signaling pathways,
might also influence the SP phenotype (33). Further analyses would
be necessary to clarify the mechanisms underlying the regulation of
cancer stem cells in HCC.
Bmi1 regulates the cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence by
repressing the Ink4a/Arf locus (26, 34). In Bmi1-deficient mice, the
expression of Ink4a and Arf is markedly increased in HSCs (17).
Conversely, deletion of both Ink4a and Arf substantially restores
the impaired capacity of Bmi1 / HSCs to self-renew (22). These
findings suggest that Bmi1 regulates HSCs by acting as a critical
failsafe against the premature loss of HSCs induced by Ink4a and
Arf-dependent senescence pathways. On the other hand, the Ink4aRb and Arf-p53–dependent cellular senescence pathways play a
critical role in the triggering of oncogene-induced senescence,
which is of substantial importance to the elimination of transforming cells that potentially develop into cancer stem cells
(26, 35). In the present study, the expression of the INK4A and
ARF genes was augmented by BMI1 knockdown in PLC/PRF/5
cells. In this case, derepression of INK4A and ARF could account for
the impaired self-renewal of PLC/PRF/5 SP cells with BMI1
knockdown. On the other hand, knockdown of BMI1 in Huh7 cells
resulted in no remarkable changes in INK4A and ARF gene
expression compared with the control. Given that the function of
p53 is impeded by mutations in Huh7 cells (36), additional targets
for BMI1 other than the INK4A/ARF locus might be responsible for

Figure 5. Loss of tumorigenicity in SP cells by BMI1 knockdown. 1  103 control SP cells from Huh7 (A) and PLC/PRF/5 cells (B) generated tumors in the left
subcutaneous space of recipient mice (arrows ), whereas BMI1 knockdown SP cells failed to initiate tumors in the right space. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed
the nuclear localization of BMI1 in tumor cells generated by control SP cells. Scale bar, 100 Am.

the impaired ability of Huh7 SP cells to self-renew. Thus, BMI1
might function in the maintenance of HCC cancer stem cells in
both an INK4A/ARF-dependent and an INK4A/ARF-independent
manner.
Finally, the present loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays
revealed that BMI1 determines the self-renewal capability of SP
cells, which directly contributes to the tumorigenic potential.
However, further analysis will definitely be necessary to determine
the role of BMI1 in primary HCC cancer stem cells (37). Our
findings also indicate BMI1 to be a novel therapeutic target for the
eradication of cancer stem cells in HCC. It would be of paramount
importance to understand differential functions and targets of
BMI1 in normal and cancer stem cells.
