BACKGROUND: The objective of this trial was to determine how a mucoadhesive hydrogel (MuGard), a marketed medical device, would
fare when tested with the strictness of a conventional multi-institutional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study format.
METHODS: A total of 120 subjects planned to receive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for treatment of head and neck cancers were
randomized to receive either MuGard or sham control rinse (SC) during CRT. Subjects completed the validated Oral Mucositis Daily
Questionnaire. Weight, opiate use, and World Health Organization (WHO) oral mucositis (OM) scores were recorded. Subjects who
dosed at least once daily during the first 2.5 weeks of CRT were included in the efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Of 120 subjects enrolled,
78 (SC, N 5 41; MuGard, N 5 37) were eligible for efficacy analysis. Both cohorts were similar in demographics, baseline characteristics,
primary tumor type, and planned CRT regimen. MuGard effectively mitigated OM symptoms as reflected by area under the curve of
daily patient-reported oral soreness (P 5.034) and WHO scores on the last day of radiation therapy (P 5.038). MuGard was also associated with nonsignificant trends related to therapeutic benefit including opioid use duration, and OM scores (WHO criteria) at CRT
week 4. Rinse compliance was identical between cohorts. No significant adverse events were reported, and the adverse event incidence was similar between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Testing MuGard, a rinse marketed as a device, in a standard clinical trial format
demonstrated its superiority to SC in mitigating OM symptoms, delaying OM progression, and its safety and tolerability. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, painful, debilitating side effect of chemoradiation therapy (CRT).1,2 Severe OM is
also associated with adverse quality of life, weight loss, increased opioid use, gastrostomy-dependent feeding, greater numbers of emergency room and unplanned office visits, and hospitalizations.3,4 OM’s incremental cost in the head and neck
cancer (HNC) population is about $18,000.5
OM treatment options for patients with HNC are sparse.6 A number of agents have US Food and Drug Administration marketing allowances as medical devices including GelClair, Episil, Mucotrol, Caphosol, and MuGard, but

evaluation of medical devices is markedly less rigorous
than is typical for biologics or drugs. In addition, the use
of “magic mouthwashes” is relatively common. Typically, the composition of such agents is largely based on
institutional folklore and objective assessments of their
efficacy is marginal.7 In a comparative trial, the efficacy
of a magic mouthwash formulation was no better than a
control solution.8
MuGard is a proprietary viscous liquid mucoadhesive
hydrogel (MAH) formulation. Results of open-labeled trials suggested that it created a palliative barrier over injured
mucosa and reduced objective mucositis scores compared
with historical data.9,10 As is the case of other OM devices,
data from a multi-institutional controlled clinical trial were
lacking. The objective of the present investigation was to
assess MuGard’s efficacy as an intervention for OM
induced by standard CRT used for the treatment of HNC.
The study replicated OM trials used to evaluate drugs or
biologics and included a multi-institutional, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled design. In this way, we
sought to establish a more rigorous standard for the assessment and clinical adoption of devices intended for OM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Institutional review boards of participating sites (n 5 22)
approved the study. Planned enrollment was 120 adults (
18 years) having Karnofsky performance scores > 80% with
recently diagnosed, pathologically confirmed squamous cell
carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or
larynx, or related site, planned to receive a conventional
course of external beam irradiation (single daily fractions of
2.0-2.2 Gy) with a cumulative dose of between 50 Gy and
72 Gy. Concomitant cisplatin was administered weekly or
triweekly. The radiation field included at least 2 mucosal
sites within the oral cavity (buccal mucosa, floor of mouth,
lateral or ventral tongue, or soft palate).
Study Medication

MuGard and sham-control (SC) were supplied by Access
Pharmaceuticals. The SC consisted of flavored saline bicarbonate rinse indistinguishable in appearance from
MuGard and identically bottled and labeled.

the first day of radiation and continuing until the last day
of radiation therapy (LDRT). Subjects were advised to
refrain from eating or drinking for 1 hour after dosing.
Investigators could provide supportive therapy as
needed including analgesics, antiemetics, antifungal therapy, hydration, or other treatment. Agents suggested to
modify OM risk or course were excluded including amifostine, benzydamine, cevimeline, glutamine rinse, topical
GM-CSF, interleukin-11, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, diphenhydramine, paliferim, pilocarpine, steroid
rinses, sucralfate, and various oral rinse medical devices.
At baseline and then daily beginning on the first day
of radiation until the LDRT subjects completed the Oral
Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ), a validated
patient-reported instrument.11,12 On the first visit during
week 4 of radiation and on the LDRT the oral cavity was
examined and OM severity scored by a trained evaluator
using WHO criteria. Safety data (AEs) were recorded on
days of radiation.
Patients received a physical examination, assessment
of performance score, height and weight measurements,
and a quality of life (QoL) assessment weekly. Twice
weekly, concomitant medication use, gastrostomy placement, and/or use and study rinse reconciliation were performed and subjects were given new test material.
Efficacy Endpoints

The study’s primary endpoint was a reduction in mouth
and throat soreness (MTS) associated with OM as defined
by area under the curve (AUC) of the OMDQ MTS question 2 (Q2) score. Q2 is a 5-point categorical scale in which
patients grade MTS from 0 (no soreness) to 4 (extreme soreness)3 which is a component of the OMDQ in that it tracks
very well with objective (WHO score and opioid use) and
subjective measurement of OM severity.3,13
Secondary endpoints included delay to onset of
OMDQ score of > 2 (previously described to align with
severe mucositis)3,13 and time to OM resolution. Health
and resource use endpoints were opioid use, gastrostomy
placement and feedings, subjects’ ability to eat, radiation
treatment breaks, unplanned office and emergency room
visits and changes in body weight during CRT.
Analysis Populations

Study Design

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel study in which subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive
SC or MuGard. Subjects were asked to rinse with 5 mL of
study material for a full minute and expectorate, with a
target dosing frequency of 4 times per day beginning on
1434

Safety was evaluated in all subjects who used study rinse
(Safety Population). Efficacy parameters were assessed for
subjects who documented daily study medication use during
the first 2.5 weeks following the start of radiation therapy
(Efficacy Population). Efficacy assessment was deliberately
restricted to this population as this was a postmarketing
Cancer

An Adhesive Hydrogel Mitigates Mucositis/Allison et al

study in which we sought to determine objectively if subjects
who used the rinse benefited. The minimum dosing duration was based on the well-established course of OM which
identifies 30 Gy as the cumulative dose typically associated
with the onset of ulcerative mucositis.14
Randomization and Statistical Methods

A stratified block randomization (1:1) with a block size of
4 was provided by an independent statistician and participants were assigned to either the MuGard or SC arms by
an isolated employee of the CRO that managed this study.
Interim analyses of the data were conducted following
accrual of 40 and 70 patients. Sample size was determined
based on an alpha of 0.05 and an 80% power approximately based on a standard deviations noted in an earlier
mucositis trial in which efficacy was demonstrated.13 The
original accrual target of 80 patients was increased to 120
patients prior to the second interim analysis.
Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze
study results. The primary efficacy endpoint, comparison
of the AUC of OMDQ MTS Q2 for the 2 cohorts, was
evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors
for treatment and initial OMDQ MTS score. A
Wilcoxon-Gehan test was used to assess the effect of treatment on delay of MTS Question 2 > 2. Fisher’s exact test
was used in comparing the numbers of patients in each
cohort in comparisons of weight loss, opioid use, WHO
scores, frequency of emergency room or office visits, gastrostomy feeding, or unplanned breaks in treatment.
The statistical analyses were conducted with the SAS
System, version 9.1.3. All analyses were subject to formal
verification procedures. P values < 0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Study Population

A total of 120 subjects were enrolled in the Safety Population
and were equally distributed between treatment arms. The
78 subjects who met the Efficacy Population criteria (SC,
n 5 41; MuGard, n 5 37) were accrued at 18 study sites
(range, 1-10 subjects per site; mean, 4.2 subjects per site).
In the Efficacy Population, there was no difference
between study arms in the proportion of eligible subjects
(SC 83%, MuGard 78%), the number of weeks on study
or weeks on study medication (Table 1).
Efficacy Demographics and Baseline
Characteristics

Subject demographics and baseline characteristics were
similar between study arms. Slightly more males (90%)
Cancer

were randomized to the SC versus MuGard (78%) arm.
SC subjects were slightly heavier (89.7 kg) at baseline
compared to those in the MuGard arm (81.5 kg) possibly
due to the sex distribution noted. Performance scores
were equivalent. No differences in baseline WHO mucositis scores were seen. Study cohorts were the same with
respect to tumor staging, planned cumulative radiation
dose, and type of radiation planned (IMRT: SC 5 93%,
MuGard 5 89%).
Primary tumor sites were similar between cohorts.
The vast majority of subjects presented with cancers of the
oral cavity and oropharynx. The number of subjects with
non-oral or oropharyngeal primary sites was equivalent.
Efficacy Analyses

For the study’s primary endpoint, MuGard effectively attenuated the AUC for daily mean MTS scores versus SC (Table 2). Whereas the mean AUC for OMDQ Q2 was 86.1 for
SC, it was 68.0 for MuGard-treated individuals (P 5 .034,
ANOVA). LS Mean AUC for the MuGard cohort (86.5)
was superior to SC (103.3; P 5 .046, ANOVA).
The study yielded several results that although not
statistically significant (NS) suggested that MuGard might
provide additional clinical benefit. MuGard appeared to
delay the onset of significant MTS (Table 3). Whereas the
median cumulative radiation dose to an MTS Q2 score > 2
was 28 Gy among SC subjects, it was 40 Gy among
MuGard-treated subjects (NS). Similarly, time to first
occurrence of MTS Q2 scores of > 2 was 19 days for SC
versus 28 days MuGard (NS). MuGard did not affect time
to resolution of patient-reported MTS.
Another NS result implied that MuGard use was
coupled with reduced duration of opioid use versus SC.
SC subjects used opioids longer (median 16.0 days) compared to subjects receiving MuGard (6.0 days). This trend
was unaffected by the route of opioid administration (Table 4). Likewise, the duration of topical or oral opioid use
was 50% less than SC in MuGard-treated subjects. And
whereas the overall use of parenteral opioid among study
subjects was low (SC 5 12%; MuGard 5 22%), for subjects using this form of opioid, the median duration for
SC-treated individuals was 21 days versus 3.5 days for
MuGard subjects (NS).
Clinician-assessed OM evaluations were performed
at radiation week 4 and on LDRT (Table 5). Although
WHO scores trended in favor of MuGard at week 4 when
ulcerative mucositis (WHO grades 2, 3, or 4) occurred in
43% of MuGard-treated subjects versus 61% of SCtreated subjects (NS) and severe (grades 3, 4) mucositis
occurred in 16% of MuGard- versus 24% SC-treated

subjects (NS). On the LDRT, a statistically significant
benefit (P 5 .038, Fisher’s exact test) was seen for
MuGard in ulcerative mucositis frequency (SC 5 68%;
MuGard 5 43%). The trend noted for severe OM was
consistent (NS), SC 5 44% versus MuGard 5 27%.
MuGard-treated subjects trended toward less weight
loss than control subjects (NS) (Table 6). At the end of
the study, mean weight loss in the MuGard cohort was
half (52%) that in the sham cohort.
There were no relevant differences with respect to
frequency of emergency room or office visits, gastrostomy
feeding, or unplanned breaks in treatment, or patientreported QoL.
Safety

No difference was observed in unanticipated AEs between
study cohorts in either the Safety or Efficacy populations
(SC 5 12% versus MuGard 5 8%) (Table 7). There were
no cases in which MuGard was discontinued because of
an AE, but 2 SC subjects stopped study medication use
because of nausea or vomiting.
DISCUSSION
MuGard is an oral rinse product for the management of
OM that is regulated as a medical device. The rigor of
OM clinical trials required for assessment of drugs or biologics has not been extended to medical devices which can
be marketed with minimal or no supportive clinical data.
In the current environment in which evidence-based decision making is a mandate, we believed that it was highly
desirable to define medical device efficacy more rigorously
using a multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled approach that characterizes typical
drug trials. The primary efficacy endpoints of this trial
were based on a symptom-dependent, patient-reported
measurement for OM: MTS scored by criteria delineated
by OMDQ Q2. Endpoint selection was based on 3 considerations: the OMDQ was validated in a variety of
patient populations11; OMDQ Q2 scores correlate well
with objective and functional measures of OM3,11,13,15;
combining OMDQ self-assessment with objective measures of mucositis provided an opportunity to assess
MuGard’s overall clinical benefit.
Saline-bicarbonate rinse was selected as the SC rinse
because it is safe and physically resembles MuGard. A preservative in SC imparted a slight “medicinal” flavor similar to that in MuGard. Because saline-bicarbonate rinse is
a treatment for OM symptom amelioration recommended by the National Cancer Institute,16 it is probably
not a true sham or placebo. Possibly, control subjects

50% of the patients using SC noted MTS scores  2 within
15 days of the start of radiation, that frequency of OM was
not seen in the MuGard arm until day 37 (NS). Of the 24
subjects in each study cohort requiring oral opioid analgesics, those treated with MuGard used narcotics for a median
12.5 days compared to 27.5 days for control subjects (NS).
Subjects treated with MuGard were better able to maintain
baseline weights than controls. Consistent with prior studies17 mean weight loss in the SC cohort was 9.14%. In contrast, mean weight loss in the MuGard cohort was 5.28%.
Clinician-WHO assessments of OM scored midway
through radiation and the LDRT trended in favor of
MuGard. At LDRT, this trend reached statistical significance. The reason for this finding is unclear as MuGard’s
formulation does not include known biologically active
components. MuGard likely forms a thin, temporary protective hydrogel layer over the mucosa. Conceivably,
MuGard might entrap mucins, which have been identified as having a protective role in chemotherapy-induced
mucosal injury.18,19 Additional studies are needed to test
this hypothesis.
Although all subjects were included in the safety
analysis (an intent-to-treat population), the efficacy analysis was limited to the small number of subjects who complied with using study medication at least once a day in

the first 2.5 weeks of RT. Although this rate was the same
for individuals in either cohort and was the same as had
been reported in an earlier multicenter European study,10
it nonetheless compromised the trial’s statistical power.
This resulted in positive and consistent efficacy trends for
several outcomes, but which lacked statistical significance.
A recent report of a single site assessment of MuGard in
patients with HNC confirmed that its effectiveness was
enhanced with dosing concurrent with the start of
CRT.20
Accrual to the study was stopped following the finding of statistical significance for the primary endpoint at
the second interim analysis. Because the finding was the
same as was noted at an earlier analysis, it was concluded
that additional accrual into the placebo arm would not alter the study’s conclusion and would not be in the interest
of subjects assigned to the placebo cohort. This was done
understanding that the statistical analyses of other endpoints would be handicapped.
Our definition of full study compliance may have
been overly ambitious, because it mandated a final study
visit 4 weeks after the LDRT. This requirement impacted
the observed low compliance rate (50%) among the Safety
Population. Case report forms indicated that early dropout was a consequence of symptomatic subjects believing
that they had received SC and not wishing to continue,
subjects being overwhelmed by their disease and treatment, or formulation intolerance. Of individuals who terminated early, study medication intolerance was only
noted in a small number equally distributed between
cohorts. We did not attempt to stratify endpoints by dosing frequency. Despite MuGard’s efficacy in attenuating
MTS, it was not superior to SC in impacting subjects’
ability to swallow, eat, or drink. Nor did MuGard significantly alter gastrostomy reliance, unplanned office visits,
emergency room visits, or hospitalizations.
This study represents the first multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of a medical device
indicated for OM treatment. It is hoped that this study
design provides a template for evaluation of other agents
in the medical device class and in that way raises the
threshold of their clinical use to a level that is similar to
pharmaceuticals.
The study results support the addition of MuGard
to the armamentarium for the management of oral mucositis in patients being treated with standard radiation therapy protocols for HNC.
