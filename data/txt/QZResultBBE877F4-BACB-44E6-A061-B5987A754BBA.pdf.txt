logic malignancies(HM) with those in patients who had solid tumors (ST).

METHODS. The medical and electronic records of all patients with cancer who
had candidemia at the authors’ institution from 1993 to 2003 were reviewed for
demographic data and clinical information, including the use of prophylactic fluconazole, the infecting Candida species, and the source of candidemia (catheterrelated vs other apparent sources).

RESULTS. Six hundred thirty-five patients with candidemia were analyzed. C.
glabrata and C. krusei were the leading causes of candidemia in 31% and 24% of
patients with HM, respectively, and in 18% and 2% of patients with ST, respectively (P < .001). A catheter was the source of candidemia in 36% of the patients
with ST and in 12% of the patients with HM (P < .001). Response to antifungal
therapy occurred in 73% of the ST group compared with 49% of the HM group
(P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that fluconazole prophylaxis was a risk factor for both C. glabrata and C. krusei candidemia. The
analysis also identified neutropenia as a risk factor for all candidemia and catheter-related infection as a risk factor for C. parapsilosis candidemia.

CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study indicated that C. glabrata and C. krusei
were the leading causes of candidemia in patients with HM. Neutropenia was the
leading risk factor for all candidemia, whereas the catheter was the leading risk
factor for C. parapsilosis candidemia. Cancer 2008;112:2493–9.  2008 American

loodstream infections caused by Candida species increasingly
have become an important form of invasive candidiasis accompanied by consequent rises in related mortality rates and prolonged
hospitalization.1–5 Although Candida albicans remains the most
common fungal isolate obtained from the blood of patients with
invasive fungal infection, several studies have demonstrated a trend
toward an increased prevalence of infections with non-albicans Candida spp., such as C. glabrata and C. krusei.6–9 The past 20 years
have seen an increase in the severity of illness in hospitalized
patients, extensive use of invasive medical devices, and wider use of
broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, all of which have resulted in
an increased incidence of nosocomial fungal infections.10–12

chemotherapeutic agents and transplantation, which
lead to more profound neutropenia as well as
damage of the mucosal integrity. These immunocompromised patients also are administered more frequent and prolonged antibiotic regimens, which tend
to suppress the natural endogenous bacterial flora.
All of these factors have set the stage for a significant
increase of invasive fungal infections caused by
Candida spp.3,7,13 Today, Candida spp. rank as the
fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections in the U.S.14 Candidemia not only
is associated with increased mortality and morbidity
rates but also prolongs hospitalization and increases
medical care costs.15–17 In the current study, we compared the epidemiology of candidemia and its risk
factors in patients with hematologic malignancies
with that in patients with solid tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Characteristics
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Patients with candidemia were identified by searching infection control records and a microbiology laboratory database for all episodes of candidemia that
occurred from January 1, 1993, to January 1, 2003.
The medical and electronic records of patients with
cancer who had candidemia were reviewed for demographic data and clinical information, including
the use of prophylactic fluconazole and other antifungal agents, the infecting Candida species, the
underlying malignancy, the source of candidemia,
bone marrow transplantation status, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II
score at the onset of candidemia, intensive care unit
(ICU) stay, neutropenia status, and the use of central
venous catheters, steroids, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and hyperalimentation.
The antifungal agents that were used during this
study were predominately lipid formulations of
amphotericin B or fluconazole, depending on characterization of the fungal isolate. However, voriconazole
or echinocandin were not used, because the study
period was completed before their approval at our
center.
Microbiologic Methods
Detection of candidemia and species identification
of isolates were performed in our microbiology laboratory. The presence of Candida spp. in blood isolates was confirmed by using the Vitek YBC system
or the API 20C AUX or API 32ID (BioMerieux) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. When

necessary, germ tube analysis, morphologic analysis
with cornmeal-Tween 80 agar, and differential growth
testing at 35 8C and 43 8C were performed for confirmation. The method used for antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates and the interpretative
criteria used for evaluating this susceptibility were in
strict accordance with the recommendations of the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.18 The
intravascular segments (catheter tips) of all central
venous catheters that were used in the patient group
were cultured by using the semiquantitative rollplate method described by Maki et al.19

Definitions
On the basis of the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA),20–22 candidemia was
defined as the isolation of a Candida spp. from at
least 1 blood culture in the presence of signs and
symptoms of systemic fungal infection. A case was
considered likely to be catheter-related when the
same Candida species was isolated both from a peripheral blood culture and from the catheter tip,
yielding >15 colony-forming units by using the semiquantitative roll-plate culture method in the absence
of other sources of candidemia, or from a quantitative blood culture that was collected through a central venous catheter, yielding 5-fold more colonyforming units per mm3 than were yielded in a simultaneous culture of blood collected from a peripheral
vein. Secondary candidemia was defined as a bloodstream infection caused by a Candida species with a
documented concurrent infection or colonization
caused by the same Candida species at a site other
than the catheter in accordance with the guidelines
described by Pittet and Wenzel.15 Neutropenia was
defined as a neutrophil count <500 neutrophils/
mm3. Response was defined as the resolution of all
clinical manifestations (such as fever or chills) of the
candidemia with sterilization of the bloodstream.
Failure to respond was defined as persistence of the
clinical signs and symptoms of the fungal infection,
persistence of blood cultures positive for Candida
spp., development of a Candida infection at a new
site, or a combination of these factors.
Statistical Analysis
The chi-square test and Fisher exact tests were used
to compare categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the Student t test or the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Logistic
regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for candidemia caused by different species. First, univariate analyses were performed

to evaluate the predictive effect of each factor alone.
Then, any factor with a univariate P value <.1 was
included in a full multiple logistic regression model.
Final models were determined by using a backward
method for variable selection. All tests were conducted as 2-sided tests at a significance level of
P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed by using
the SPSS software program (version 12.0; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
We evaluated 635 episodes of candidemia based on
the definitions described above that occurred over
the 10-year study period. Of these episodes, 354
(56%) occurred in patients with underlying solid
tumors, and 281 (44%) occurred in patients with
underlying hematologic malignancies. Among the
patients with hematologic malignancies, C. glabrata
was the most common infecting Candida species
(31% compared with 18% in patients with solid
tumors; P  .001) followed by C. krusei at 24% (compared with 2% in patients with solid tumors;
P  .001). In contrast, C. albicans (45%; P  .001) and
C. parapsilosis (20%; P 5 .045) were the most common infecting Candida spp. in patients with underlying solid tumors. The numbers of infections caused
by C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii, C. lusitaniae, and
mixed Candida spp. were comparable in the 2
patient groups (Table 1).
The mean age, the percentage of patients who
were men, the mean ICU stay during the month
before the onset of candidemia, and the number of
patients who underwent transplantation within the
previous year were similar in the 2 patient groups
(Table 2). Patients with hematologic malignancies
were more critically ill than patients with solid

tumors at the onset of their candidemia, as evidenced by higher mean APACHE II scores (mean 
standard deviation: 15.3  4.6 vs 13.4  4.3, respectively; P < .001). Also, more patients with hematologic malignancies than patients with solid tumors
received corticosteroids and prophylactic antifungals
(P < .001). Furthermore, patients with hematologic
malignancies were admitted to the ICU more frequently (46% vs 33%; P 5 .001), more frequently were
neutropenic (75% vs 20%; P < .001) during the course
of their candidemia, and more of them had persistent neutropenia (41% vs 4%; P < .001). Conversely,
candidemia was catheter-related more often in
patients with solid tumors than in patients with hematologic malignancies (36% vs 12%; P < .001). In
addition, 73% of patients with solid tumors had clinical and microbiologic responses to treatment with
antifungal agents compared with 49% of patients
with hematologic malignancies (P < .001).
According to multiple logistic regression analysis,
factors that were predictive of C. albicans candidemia were an absence of neutropenia (odds ratio
[OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.20–
2.44 [P 5 .047]), the presence of an underlying solid
tumor (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.54-4 [P < .001]), and no
prior use of prophylactic fluconazole (OR, 3.33; 95%
CI, 2.04-5.56; [P < .001]) (Table 3). Antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole and the presence of neutropenia were independent risk factors for C. krusei
candidemia. In addition, antifungal prophylaxis with

fluconazole was a predisposing risk factor for C.
glabrata candidemia, the presence of neutropenia
was an independent risk factor for C. tropicalis candidemia, and catheter-related infection was an independent risk factor for C. parapsilosis candidemia.
Furthermore, in the late 1990s, there was a shift in
the distribution of Candida spp. with the increase in
the rate of candidemia caused by non-albicans Candida spp., predominately C. glabrata and C. krusei
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated a shift from C. albicans to non-albicans Candida spp. as the predominant infecting species in patients with cancer who
had candidemia. Specifically, the majority of the
cases of candidemia in this study were caused by
non-albicans Candida spp. (69%), and more than
half of the patients had underlying solid tumors
(56%). C. glabrata caused most of the cases of candidemia in patients with hematologic malignancies
(31%), whereas C. albicans was the most frequent
infecting species in patients with solid tumors (46%).
Candida spp. have become among the most
common organisms causing nosocomial bloodstream
infections over the past 20 years.3,14 The National
Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System reports
on trends in nosocomial primary bloodstream infections in the U.S. From 1980 to 1989, 124 National
Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System hospitals
reported more than 25,000 primary bloodstream
infections. During that period, the rates of bloodstream infections caused by Candida spp. increased
significantly.23 By the 1990s, Candida spp. had
become the fourth most common organisms causing
nosocomial bloodstream infections.14 Although at
one time C. albicans was the most frequently isolated
Candida species among patients with candidemia,

* Data from Pittet 199634 based on a study on the epidemiology of Candidemia in 1988-1992 at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Fluconazole was introduced in 1989 and came
into heavy prophylactic use after 1993.

over the past few decades, authors have documented
increases in the rates of candidemia caused by nonalbicans Candida spp., predominantly C. glabrata
and C. krusei, especially in critically ill and immunocompromised patients with malignancies.7,23–30
Among the factors that have been proposed to
explain this shift in the distribution of the Candida
spp. responsible for candidemia is the prevalent use
of fluconazole as a prophylactic antifungal agent,
especially in patients with hematologic malignancies
and recipients of bone marrow transplantation.29,31
Furthermore, several investigators have postulated
that the widespread use of fluconazole would have
selected Candida spp. That intrinsically are resistant
or less sensitive to fluconazole, such as C. glabrata
and C. krusei.24,26,29,32,33 Investigators have identified
several other risk factors for candidemia over the
years, including the use of central venous catheters,
neutropenia, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids. In agreement with the findings from studies in hospitals other than ours,31,34
the current study demonstrated that patients with
candidemia caused by a non-albicans Candida species received prophylactic antifungal agents before
the onset of their infections more frequently than
patients with candidemia caused by C. albicans (51%
vs 15%; P < .001). Fluconazole was the most common prophylactic antifungal agent received before
the onset of candidemia: It was the agent administered in 82% of the cases caused by non-albicans
Candida spp.
More patients with solid tumors than patients
with hematologic malignancies had catheter-related
candidemia, and C. parapsilosis was the most com-

mon non-albicans cause of candidemia in the former
group. C. parapsilosis is known to adhere to the surface of catheters through a fibrin sheath and, thus,
cause candidemia. In general, in a patient with cancer who has an indwelling central venous catheter
and candidemia, the catheter should be suspected as
the source of the infection. In addition, catheterrelated candidemia may be associated with serious
complications, such as septic thrombosis, endocarditis, and meningitis.21
More than a decade ago, Abi-Said et al described
the epidemiology of candidiasis in cancer patients
between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1992 at
our institution, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. C. albicans was the leading cause
of candidemia followed by C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, even in patients with hematologic malignancies.25 The changing epidemiology observed in this
patient population over time is consistent in the
comparisons outlined in Table 4. A significant decrease in the frequency of C. albicans and C. tropicalis was noted with a simultaneous significant
increase in C. glabrata and C. krusei with the wide
use of fluconazole in patients with leukemia and
lymphoma and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients during the 1990s and 2000s (Tables
3,4).
This may raise another question regarding the
newer IDSA guidelines of recommending posaconazole for prophylaxis in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and
in high-risk acute leukemia patients. On the basis of
2 studies by Ullman et al and Cornely et al.35,36 it was
demonstrated that posaconazole prophylaxis reduced
all-cause mortality, fungal-related mortality, and
invasive fungal infection compared with fluconazole.
This new generation of azoles, when used for prophylaxis, may have an effect on Candida epidemiology that needs to be determined.
Why the use of fluconazole did not decrease the
rate of C. parapsilosis candidemia, although the organism usually is susceptible to this antifungal agent,
is a question that may be answered by the finding
that C. parapsilosis is associated specifically with
catheter-related candidemia (Table 3). Several studied have demonstrated that C. parapsilosis organisms
adhere to the surface of indwelling central venous
catheters by embedding themselves in a biofilm
layer; and, in that biofilm matrix, they become resistant to conventional antifungal agents, particularly
fluconazole.37–40
Candidemia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Reported mortality rates have
ranged from 30% to 75% in several published studies

2497

of patients with and without cancer.1,2,10,41,42 In the
current study, response to antifungal therapy was significantly better among patients with solid tumors
than among patients with hematologic malignancies
(P  .001). Regardless of the types of antifungal therapy used, the worse response in patients with hematologic malignancies may have been caused in part
by the severity of the infection and the status of the
underlying disease. Patients with hematologic malignancies had higher APACHE II scores, were admitted
to the ICU more frequently (P 5 .001), were neutropenic more frequently during the course of their candidemia, and had persistent neutropenia more often
(P < .001). In addition, the overall response was better in patients who did not receive prior antifungal
prophylaxis regardless of the treatment modality.
Hence, responses to antifungal therapy are multifactorial and depend on the host factors, underlying disease, severity of immunosuppression, and presence
of indwelling devices.
This study had some limitations because of its
retrospective cohort design, which did not allow
assessment of other potentially important differences
between the hematologic malignancy and solid tumor groups, such as the presence of mucositis and
myocitis, the type and duration of previous or concomitant antibacterial-based therapy, dissemination,
and underlying disease activity. In addition, we may
not have detected patients with prior colonization or
infection with Candida spp.
In conclusion, compared with patients who had
solid tumors, patients who had hematologic malignancies were at greater risk for candidemia caused
by non-albicans Candida spp., the most common of
which were C. glabrata and C. krusei. This finding
was associated with prior use of fluconazole as a
prophylactic antifungal agent. In addition, patients
who had solid tumors had better responses to antifungal therapy than patients who had hematologic
malignancies; and, among all of the patients in the
study, the response was better in patients who had
not received prior prophylaxis with fluconazole.
