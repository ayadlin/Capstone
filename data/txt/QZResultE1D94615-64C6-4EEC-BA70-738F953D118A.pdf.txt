Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH), drives a metabolic shift to
aerobic glycolysis in FH-deficient kidney tumors and cell lines from patients with hereditary
leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer (HLRCC), resulting in decreased levels of AMP-activated kinase
(AMPK) and p53 tumor suppressor, and activation of the anabolic factors, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
and ribosomal protein S6. Reduced AMPK levels leads to diminished expression of the DMT1
iron transporter, and the resulting cytosolic iron deficiency activates the iron regulatory proteins,
IRP1 and IRP2, and increases expression of the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α.
Silencing of HIF-1α or activation of AMPK diminishes invasive activities, indicating that
alterations of HIF-1α and AMPK contribute to the oncogenic growth of FH-deficient cells.

Introduction
Understanding the underlying mechanisms of metabolic alterations in cancer, particularly
the metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, has the potential to improve cancer diagnosis and
provide the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches (Kaelin and Thompson, 2010). The

TCA cycle plays a key role in energy production as well as biosynthesis of lipid and amino
acids, and mutations of the TCA cycle genes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH), are associated with tumor formation (Baysal et al., 2000; King et al.,
2006; Tomlinson et al., 2002; Toro et al., 2003). Germline mutations of FH are associated
with the development of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)
(Tomlinson et al., 2002), whereas germline mutations in SDH are associated with
paragangliomas (PGL), pheochromocytomas (PHEO), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
(Baysal et al., 2000; Hao et al., 2009). HLRCC patients are predisposed to the development
of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and an aggressive form of type II papillary kidney
cancer that is characterized by distinctive architectural and morphologic features (Launonen
et al., 2001; Merino et al., 2007). HLRCC renal tumors differ from other genetically defined
types of hereditary renal cancers in that they often present as solitary lesions with a
propensity to metastasize early to regional and distant lymph nodes. Previous studies have
shown that FH deficiency results in the accumulation of fumarate, which inhibits prolyl
hydroxylases (PHDs) and impairs HIF-1α and HIF-2α degradation (Isaacs et al., 2005;
Pollard et al., 2005). Accumulation of HIF has been proposed to promote tumorigenesis
through dysregulation of growth factors VEGF, TGF-α and PDGF, the Glut-1 glucose
transporter, and glycolytic enzymes (Isaacs et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2005; Pollard et al.,
2007; Semenza, 2009).

Recently, UOK262, a kidney cancer cell line derived from a retroperitoneal metastasis in a
patient with recurrent HLRCC kidney cancer (Yang et al., 2010), exhibited "precisely the
properties expected of a Warburg tumor" (Bayley and Devilee, 2010). Warburg observed
that cancer cells depend on glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for
energy production and he theorized that abnormalities in mitochondrial energy production
constituted a central aspect of carcinogenesis (DeBerardinis et al., 2008; Warburg, 1956). In
UOK262 cells, loss of functional FH impairs the TCA cycle, imposing a need for metabolic
transformation. As a result, UOK262 cells exhibit extremely low respiration rates, elevated
levels of HIF-1α and Glut-1, increased glucose dependence, and increased lactate production
(Sudarshan et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in intracellular metabolic
sensing and adaptation (Hardie, 2007) and occupies a central position in a complex
metabolic network implicated in tumor formation (Jones and Thompson, 2009; Luo et al.,
2005). AMPK is a highly conserved heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase complex
composed of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits, each of which is encoded
by two or three distinct genes (α1, 2; β1, 2; γ1, 2, 3). AMPK is activated typically, but not
exclusively, by an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. The enzymes regulated by AMPK
include key regulators of protein, fatty acid and glycerolipid syntheses, such as the
mammalian homolog of target of rapamycin (mTOR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the
transcriptional regulator sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein 1C (SREBP-1C), and
fatty acid synthase (FAS). Once activated, AMPK switches on ATP-producing catabolic
pathways (such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis), and switches off ATP-consuming
anabolic pathways (such as protein and fatty acid synthesis), both by short-term effects on
phosphorylation and by long-term effects on gene expression. Conversely, when AMPK
activities are reduced, fatty acid and protein biosynthetic pathways are activated through
multiple mechanisms, including dephosphorylation of ACC and phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6 through the mTOR signaling pathway.
Here we have examined the metabolic status of FH-deficient HLRCC kidney cancer tumor
tissues and two distinct HLRCC kidney cancer cell lines, focusing on the aerobic glycolysis
of FH-deficient cells, and associated changes in AMPK, HIFα subunits, and iron
metabolism.

RESULTS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Glycolytic and tumorigenic features of FH-deficient cells were reversed by restoration of
FH activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We measured the levels of TCA cycle metabolites in UOK262 cells, and found that fumarate
levels were markedly increased, and malate levels were correspondingly low in UOK262
compared to HK-2 cells, consistent with FH dysfunction (Figure 1A), and these
abnormalities were reversed by stable transfection of wild type FH in UOK262 (UOK262WT) (Figure 1A). To examine tumorigenicity of the HLRCC cell line, UOK262 cells were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Palpable tumors developed within 32 days, with a
tumor doubling time of ~ 17 days. Animals injected with UOK262-WT did not develop
tumors (Figure 1B), indicating that FH dysfunction was required for tumor growth. We
measured oxygen consumption and lactate production in UOK262 cells (Sudarshan et al.,
2009; Yang et al., 2010) and in a recently derived HLRCC cell line, UOK268. Consistent
with a metabolic switch to glycolytic metabolism, we observed low oxygen consumption
rates and high lactate production in both UOK262 and UOK268 cells compared to HK-2
cells (Figure 1C). In addition, UOK262 cells displayed low complex I activities (Figure 1D),
and electron microscopy studies revealed swollen mitochondria with severe fragmentation
of the cristae in UOK262 cells, similar to abnormalities found in non-HLRCC renal cells
(UOK117C4 and 786-0WT) exposed to 3-NPA, an inhibitor of the TCA cycle enzyme SDH
(Figure 1E). In contrast to most other types of genetically defined kidney cancers, we
observed that metastatic HLRCC kidney tumors nearly uniformly exhibit intense
fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET scan (Figure 1F), consistent with the increased
dependence on glycolysis observed in HLRCC cell lines in-vitro.
Evidence for glycolysis-associated cytosolic iron deficiency in FH-deficient RCC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent studies have suggested that IRPs, cytosolic proteins that sense iron levels and
regulate transcripts containing iron-responsive elements (IREs) (Muckenthaler et al., 2008;
Rouault, 2006), are important in tumorigenesis (Maffettone et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2008).
When cytosolic iron levels are low, binding of IRPs to IREs in the 5’UTR of transcripts
represses translation, whereas binding to IREs in the 3’UTR generally stabilizes the
transcripts. When cytosolic iron levels are high, IRPs do not bind to IREs (Figure 2A). IREbinding activities of IRPs were markedly higher in UOK262 cells than in control cells
(Figure 2B), suggesting that cytosolic iron levels were lower in UOK262 cells. Quantitative
RT-PCR showed that transcript levels of IRP1 and IRP2 were not increased in UOK262
cells (not shown). Increased IRP1 activities in UOK262 cells correlated with decreased
cytosolic aconitase activities (Figure 2C), consistent with the conversion of IRP1 to the IREbinding form in iron-deficient cells. Increased IRP2 activity in UOK262 cells correlated
with the stabilization of IRP2 protein in iron-deficient cells (Figure 2D). Levels of the IRP
target, TfR1, were higher in UOK262 cells (Figure 2E), consistent with activation of IRPs.
Fumarate accumulation did not account for the increased levels of IRP2 (Figure S1A and
S1B available online).
Since UOK262 cells depend on high glucose for growth (Yang et al., 2010), these cells were
routinely cultured in media containing 25 mM D-glucose (normal serum glucose: 4–6 mM).
Interestingly, activation of IRPs decreased in UOK262 cells cultured in lower levels of
glucose, whereas changes in glucose concentrations did not affect IRP activities and IRP2
stability in non-HLRCC cells, suggesting that features of the glycolytic shift were
responsible for the activation of IRPs in UOK262 cells (Figure 2F, 2G, and Figure S1C–E).

Contribution of cytosolic iron deficiency to misregulation of HIFα proteins in FH-deficient
RCC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Changes in cytosolic iron levels and IRP activities can potentially have competing effects on
HIF-1α and HIF-2α levels. Since PHDs require iron for their enzymatic activities, decreased
cellular iron levels would be expected to diminish the degradation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α
proteins (Bruick and McKnight, 2001; Epstein et al., 2001). We observed that HIF-1α
protein levels were markedly elevated in HLRCC tumor specimens (Figure 3A), in
agreement with previous reports (Isaacs et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2005). Similarly, HIF-1α
protein levels were higher UOK262 cells (Figure 3B) and UOK268 cells (Figure 3C)
compared to non-HLRCC renal cells. Fumarate accumulation was previously shown to
inhibit PHDs (Isaacs et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2005). However, our results suggest that an
additional mechanism may drive the increase of HIFα in HLRCC: reduced cytosolic iron
levels (as evidenced by activation of IRPs) may further stabilize HIFα proteins by inhibiting
PHD activities. Furthermore, iron starvation would be expected to have different effects on
expressions of the two HIFα subunits, because previous studies have shown that the HIF-2α
transcript contains an IRE in its 5'UTR, and translation of the HIF-2α transcript is repressed
by IRPs when cytosolic iron levels decrease (Sanchez et al., 2007; Zimmer et al., 2008). We
observed that HIF-2α levels were elevated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that
lacked IRP1 (Figure 3D), indicating that translational repression by activated IRP1
contributes significantly to the regulation of HIF-2α levels under both iron replete and irondepleted conditions. UOK262 cells exhibited low HIF-2α protein levels (Figure 3B), but not
mRNA (Figure 3E) levels in both iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions, consistent with
translational repression by activated IRPs. Similarly, UOK268 cells exhibited high HIF-1α
and low HIF-2α protein levels (Figure 3C). These results suggested that IRP-mediated
repression of HIF-2α translation selectively attenuated the increase in HIF-2α that was partly
driven by iron starvation, whereas HIF-1α expression was unaffected by IRP activation
(Figure S2).
Reduced AMPK levels resulted in activation of anabolic factors and activation of IRPs in
UOK262 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To understand how a mitochondrial TCA cycle dysfunction can result in changes in two
cytosolic iron-sensing proteins, we examined signaling pathways that are important in
metabolic adaptations. We observed that AMPKα-p levels were lower in HLRCC renal
tumor specimens compared to normal kidney tissue (Figure 4A). Levels of AMPKα,
AMPKβ1, phosphorylated AMPKα (AMPKα-p), phosphorylated ACC (ACC-p, an AMPK
effector) and phosphorylated Akt were also low in UOK262 cells compared to several nonHLRCC kidney cell lines (HK-2, HEK293, 786-0WT) (Figure 4B), suggesting that the
increased glycolysis in FH-deficient cancer cells did not result from activation of AMPK or
Akt (Elstrom et al., 2004; Marsin et al., 2000). Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that levels of
AMPKα1 and AMPKβ1 transcripts were relatively low in UOK262 cells (Figure 4C).
Notably, the AMP:ATP ratio in UOK262 cells was comparable to HK-2 cells (Figure 4D),
suggesting that the decrease in AMPKα-p levels in UOK262 cells was not caused by
changes in the AMP:ATP ratio. As low AMPK activity would be expected to decrease
phosphorylation of ACC and to activate mTOR, we evaluated these AMPK targets. We
observed reduced levels of ACC-p (Figure 4B), which would be expected to increase the
synthesis of the key fatty acid biosynthetic intermediate, malonyl-CoA. In addition, we
observed constitutive activation of the ribosomal protein S6, an mTOR downstream effector
(Zhang et al., 2003) (Figure 4E). These results suggested that reduced AMPK levels might
promote growth in FH-deficient renal cancer cells by enhancing fatty acid and protein
biosynthesis (Luo et al., 2005; Menendez and Lupu, 2007).

We asked if reduced AMPK levels could activate IRPs by examining non-HLRCC cells that
were treated with the AMPK inhibitor, AraA (Musi et al., 2001), or the AMPK activators,
metformin and AICAR. Treatment with AraA reduced the levels of AMPKα-p and increased
IRP activities (Figure 4F), whereas treatment with metformin or AICAR decreased IRP
activities (Figure 4G and 4H), revealing a role of AMPK in the regulation of intracellular
iron metabolism in mammalian cells. Notably, AMPKα-deficient MEFs that are deficient in
both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 (Laderoute et al., 2006) exhibited increased levels of IRP2
compared to wild-type MEFs (Figure 4I), further indicating that AMPK levels affect IRP
expression.
AMPK modulates IRP activities through the DMT1 iron transporter
Although IRP1 and IRP2 activities can be differentially regulated by many factors (Rouault,
2006), the most likely cause for simultaneous activation of both IRPs is cytosolic iron
depletion. We observed that the protein levels of DMT1 (Tabuchi et al., 2002), which
transports iron from the endosome into the cytosol after iron uptake via TfR1 (Mims and
Prchal, 2005), were extremely low in UOK262 cells (Figure 5A). DMT1 transcript levels in
UOK262 cells were 2–10 fold lower compared to non-HLRCC cells (Figure S3). Iron
depletion with Dfo did not significantly increase DMT1 levels in UOK262 cells, unlike in
HEK293 and UOK117C4 cells (Figure 5B). These results suggested that reduced iron
uptake through DMT1 caused the activation of IRPs in UOK262 cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if the changes of AMPK and DMT1 observed in UOK262 cells were driven by
loss of FH, we compared the levels of these proteins in UOK262 and UOK262-WT cells.
Expression of wild type FH in UOK262 cells increased the levels of DMT1 and AMPKα
(Figure 5C), suggesting that the observed decreases in AMPKα and DMT1 levels were
attributable to the loss of functional FH in UOK262 cells. Furthermore, activation of AMPK
in UOK262 cells by glucose limitation was accompanied by an increase in DMT1 levels
(Figure 5D), and increased iron uptake through DMT1 likely accounted for the reduced
activation of IRPs in UOK262 cells grown in low glucose (Figures 2F and 5D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We asked if reduced AMPK levels could lead to a reduction of DMT1 levels and thereby
activate IRPs in UOK262 cells by evaluating the response of non-HLRCC cells to treatment
with either the AMPK activator, metformin, or the AMPK inhibitor, AraA. Treatment of
786-0WT cells (Figure 5E) and UOK117C4 cells (data not shown) with metformin
increased ACC-p and DMT1 levels and decreased IRP activities, whereas treatment with
AraA concomitantly reduced AMPKα-p levels and DMT1 expression (Figure 5F). In
addition, AMPKα-deficient MEFs exhibited lower levels of DMT1 and increased levels of
IRP2 compared to wild-type MEFs, further suggesting that AMPK levels regulate IRP
activities through changes in DMT1 expression (Figure 5G).
Recently, induction of p53 was shown to decrease IRP activities (Zhang et al., 2008), but the
mechanism was unknown. We observed that UOK262 cells had very low p53 levels (Figure
5H), consistent with our observation that AMPK is low in UOK262 cells and reports that
AMPK stabilizes p53 through phosphorylation (Imamura et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2005). To
assess the role of p53 in IRP activation, we showed that induction of p53 increased DMT1
levels in p53ind cells (Figure 5I), whereas control cells transfected with an empty vector
exhibited no change in DMT1 levels (data not shown). Conversely, siRNA-mediated
silencing of p53 in HEK293 cells decreased DMT1 levels (Figure 5J). These results
suggested that AMPK may regulate DMT1 expression in part through its effect on p53
levels.

FH-deficient UOK268 cells also displayed reduced levels of AMPK, p53 and DMT1, and
stabilization of IRP2

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further confirm the significance of FH-AMPK-DMT1-IRP pathway in HLRCC tumors,
we examined UOK268 cells. Similar to UOK262 cells, UOK268 cells displayed reduced
levels of AMPKα-p, ACC-p, AMPKα, AMPKβ1 and p53 (Figure 6A–C). We observed that
DMT1 levels were low and IRP2 levels were high in UOK268 compared to control cells
(Figure 6A). These results from a second HLRCC cell line confirmed that remodeling of the
AMPK pathway and intracellular iron homeostasis is reproducible in FH-deficient RCC cell
lines.
Key elements of the metabolic profile of FH-deficient cells can be recapitulated by
chemical inhibition of the TCA cycle

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we asked if inhibition of other TCA cycle enzymes induced changes in AMPK,
DMT1, and IRPs similar to those observed in FH-deficient cells. Treatment with 2thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), which inhibits SDH at the SDHD subunit (Sun et al.,
2005), resulted in increased IRP activities (Figure 7A) and increased IRP2 and TfR1 protein
levels (Figure 7B) in three different non-HLRCC cell lines. As shown in Figure 2F, IRP
activation in UOK262 cells was glucose-dependent. Similarly, increasing glucose
concentrations increased the TTFA-dependent activation of IRPs (Figure 7C and 7D),
whereas lowering glucose concentrations abolished the effect of TTFA on IRP activities
(Figure 7C). Thus, inhibition of SDH activity by TTFA recapitulated the IRP activation
observed in FH-deficient cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial inhibitors can have biphasic effects on
AMPKα phosphorylation (Figure S4A). Similarly, we observed that TCA cycle inhibition of
non-HLRCC cells with TTFA initially resulted in a rapid decrease in ATP levels (Figure 7E)
and a corresponding transient increase in AMPKα-p (0.25h) (Figure 7F), followed by a
partial recovery of ATP levels (probably as a result of increased aerobic glycolysis) (Figure
7E) and a decrease in AMPKα–p and AMPKα protein levels at later time-points (Figure 7F).
At 48h time point, there were overall decreases in AMPKα and AMPKα-p levels, with
corresponding decrease in ACC-p and p53 levels, and increase in S6-p levels (Figure 7G).
More importantly, the long-term TTFA-mediated decrease in AMPK levels correlated with
diminished DMT1 levels and increased IRP activities in both HEK293 and UOK117C4 cells
(Figure 7H). In addition to TTFA, treatment with inhibitors to other SDH subunits (3-NPA)
and aconitase (MnCl2) also led to reduced AMPKα-p levels and DMT1 expression, and
increased IRP activities (Figure S4). Thus, chemical disruption of the TCA cycle can cause
non-cancer cells to remodel their metabolism to include decreased AMPK and DMT1 levels
and activation of IRPs, similar to FH-deficient UOK262 and UOK268 cells.
Silencing of HIF-1α and activation of AMPK reduced the tumorigenic potential of UOK262
cells
Previous studies have shown that elevation of HIF-2α is essential for tumor growth of Von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient cells in xenograft mouse models (Kondo et al., 2002;
Maranchie et al., 2002). Therefore, we compared HIFα levels in UOK262 cells (a papillary
type 2 RCC) with 786-0 cells (a VHL-deficient clear cell RCC) (Figure 8A). In contrast to
UOK262 cells, 786-0 cells exhibited very low levels of HIF-1α and high levels of HIF-2α.
Compared to 786-0 cells, UOK262 cells also exhibited decreased AMPKα-p, AMPKβ1 and
DMT1 levels, and increased IRP2 levels. These distinctions between VHL-deficient and FHdeficient cells suggest that disease-specific therapies could be developed. Specifically, we
observed that siRNA-mediated silencing of HIF-1α (Figure 8B) or activation of AMPK
using metformin and AICAR (Figure 8C) markedly inhibited invasion activities of UOK262
cells, suggesting that modulation of HIF-1α and AMPK signaling may offer opportunities

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fumarate hydratase-deficient kidney cancer, a clear example of the Warburg effect in
cancer, is an unusually aggressive form of type 2 papillary kidney cancer that metastasizes
when the primary tumors are as small as 1 cm, and is nearly uniformly fatal once it has
spread beyond the kidney. Here, we showed that HLRCC tumors and two different FHdeficient RCC cell lines depended on glycolysis and had low AMPK levels. In addition to
promoting fatty acid and protein biosynthetic pathways (through the activation of ACC and
S6), low AMPK levels reduced the expression of DMT1 and activated IRP1 and IRP2
(Figure 8D). Our studies demonstrated that p53 enhances expression of DMT1 (Figure 5I),
and the AMPK-dependent reduction of p53 would thus be expected to cause cytosolic iron
deficiency, activation of IRPs, and translational repression of the iron-storage protein
ferritin. Previous studies have shown that synthesis of ferritin is decreased in cells that are
stimulated by several oncogenes (Tsuji et al., 1995; Wu et al., 1999). Our studies
demonstrated that an induction of p53 resulted in increased expression of DMT1 (Figure 5I),
providing one mechanism for the previously reported p53-dependent decrease in IRP
activities and increase in ferritin levels (Zhang et al., 2008). In respiring cells, DMT1
expression is important for the uptake of iron for the biosynthesis of heme and Fe-S cluster
cofactors in the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. The AMPK-dependent decrease of
DMT1 levels may represent an integral part of the metabolic shift to glycolysis, as less iron
may be needed to support energy metabolism in glycolytic cells compared to respiring cells.
In addition, when cells are required to produce energy from glycolysis, low iron levels may
consolidate the shift to glycolysis by stabilizing HIFs or other participants in the remodeled
metabolism of FH-deficient cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that elevation of HIFα levels in FH-deficient cells resulted
from fumarate accumulation which inhibits the PHDs that mark HIFα proteins for
degradation (Isaacs et al., 2005; Pollard et al., 2005). However, many other factors may also
contribute to FH-associated neoplasias. We suggest that HIF1α is increased in HLRCC in
part because cytosolic iron deficiency also inhibits PHD activities and contributes to the
stabilization of HIF-1α proteins. Furthermore, since the HIF-2α transcript contains an IRE in
its 5’UTR (Sanchez et al., 2007), whereas the HIF-1α transcript does not, activation of IRPs
would be expected to selectively repress HIF-2α translation. We suggest that IRP activation
explains why HIF-1α levels were markedly elevated whereas HIF-2α protein levels were
very low in UOK262 and UOK268 cells (Figure 3B,C), even though HIF-2α transcript
levels in UOK262 cells were comparable to control cells (Figure 3E).
The differential expression levels of HIFα proteins in 786-0 and UOK262 cells (Figure 8A)
have important implications for the development of targeted therapeutic treatment of VHLdeficient and FH-deficient RCC. Although HIF-1α has been shown to promote
tumorigenesis in colon and pancreatic cancer cells (Chen et al., 2003; Dang et al., 2006),
studies in RCC have shown that activation of HIF-2α, and not HIF-1α, is necessary for the
tumorigenesis of VHL-deficient RCC (Kondo et al., 2002; Maranchie et al., 2002). HIF-1α
and HIF-2α have both overlapping as well as distinct targets (Gordan and Simon, 2007;
Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008; Raval et al., 2005), and HIF-1α is uniquely involved in
activating genes associated with glycolysis (Gordan and Simon, 2007; Haase, 2010). In this
study, we showed that silencing of HIF-1α inhibited the invasion activities of UOK262 cells
(Figure 8B), further suggesting that elevation of HIF-1α is critical for engineering the switch
to glycolytic metabolism in UOK262 cells.

Notably, the coordination that we observed here between glucose and iron metabolisms in
FH-deficient RCC has an evolutionary precedent in the metabolism of S. cerevisiae. When
grown in glucose-rich medium, S. cerevisiae uses fermentation (a microbial equivalent of
glycolysis) as its main metabolic pathway, and repression of the yeast AMPK homologue,
SNF1, represses expression of iron uptake genes (Haurie et al., 2003). As glucose
concentrations decrease, activation of SNF1 induces expression of iron uptake genes and
facilitates the shift to oxidative metabolism. Conversely, iron deficiency in S. cerevisiae
results in phosphorylation of SNF1, which increases glucose uptake and glycolysis, allowing
the cells to switch from respiratory to fermentative metabolism (Puig et al., 2008). Our
results suggest that the high glycolytic flux in UOK262 cells reduces AMPK and DMT1
expression levels, whereas glucose depletion diminished glycolysis and increased AMPK
signaling and DMT1 expression (Figure 5D). These studies suggest that AMPK/SNF1
signaling provides an evolutionarily conserved linkage between intermediary metabolism
and intracellular iron homeostasis. Interestingly, while the activities of several Fe-dependent
enzymes, including respiratory complex I and cytosolic aconitase, were low in UOK262
cells (Figure 1D and 2C), mitochondrial aconitase activities were not diminished in
UOK262 cells (Figure 2C), suggesting that these cells can preferentially direct iron to
specific proteins or pathways.

While previous studies on AMPK signaling have largely focused on the increase in AMPKα
phosphorylation and its role in increasing catabolism during the acute response to metabolic
stress (Hardie, 2007), fewer studies have characterized the potential importance of low
AMPK activity in promoting activities of anabolic pathways in tumorigenesis (Jones and
Thompson, 2009; Luo et al., 2005; Shaw, 2006). Here, we not only showed that levels of
AMPKα-p were diminished in FH-deficient cells, but we also found that AMPK signaling
was also regulated at the transcript and/or protein levels (Figure 4B and 4C). This metabolic
remodeling was not unique to FH-deficient cells, since chemical inhibition of SDH in noncancer cells also resulted in reduced levels of AMPK, p53, ACC-p, DMT1 and increased
levels of S6-p (Figure 7). Time-course studies indicated that, upon chemical inhibition of
SDH, changes of AMPK activities inversely correlated with changes in intracellular ATP
levels: ATP levels decreased initially upon SDH inhibition, and then gradually recovered
over the following hours (Figure 7E), whereas after an initial rapid increase, AMPKα-p
levels dropped below the levels of untreated cells (Figure 7F). After a 48 hr treatment with
TTFA, there was also a marked decrease in AMPKα protein levels (Figure 7G), which
further ensured that levels of AMPKα-p decreased regardless of the AMP:ATP ratio. These
results are similar to the decreased levels of AMPKα-p, AMPKα and AMPKβ1 proteins and
transcripts that were observed in FH-deficient cells (Figures 4B and 4C), and they show that
the obligate shift to glycolysis in FH-deficient cells produces associated changes in AMPK
activity that enhance anabolic reactions.
The high glycolytic rate, together with the decrease of AMPK signaling, can provide several
potential growth advantages to FH-deficient RCC. Although the yield of ATP per glucose
molecule is higher in OXPHOS than in glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis can provide sufficient
energy for cell proliferation, provided that the glycolytic flux is high enough (DeBerardinis
et al., 2008). Aerobic glycolysis can also confer growth advantages by diverting some of the
glucose into pathways that generate NADPH, acetyl-CoA, and ribose for fatty acid, protein
and nucleotide synthesis (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Reduced AMPK activities would
promote the efficient use of the NADPH, acetyl-CoA and ribose generated by aerobic
glycolysis by activating anabolic factors involved in protein and fatty acid synthesis (Hardie,
2007). Many cancers are characterized by upregulation of anabolic factors such as ACC,
FAS, and mTOR, all of which are inhibited by AMPK activation (Jones and Thompson,
2009; Luo et al., 2005; Shaw, 2006). Notably, reduced AMPK phosphorylation was recently
reported in breast cancer specimens (Hadad et al., 2009). Alterations in the LKB1/AMPK/

TSC/mTOR pathway are associated with a wide variety of cancers and hamartomas,
including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex (Inoki and Guan, 2009;
Jones and Thompson, 2009; Shaw, 2006). The tumor suppressor, p53, is a downstream
effector of AMPK, and p53 mutations are found in 50% of all human cancers (Vousden and
Ryan, 2009). Here, we established that diminished p53 levels result from AMPK-dependent
metabolic remodeling, adding to the potential mechanisms that impair p53 function in
tumorigenesis. Thus, the marked increase in glycolysis and reduced AMPK levels in FHdeficient cancer cells together may promote anabolic metabolism (through the activation of
ACC and S6) and repress senescence and apoptosis (as a result of the decrease of p53 levels)
(Vousden and Ryan, 2009) in a manner conducive to cancer cell proliferation (Figure 8D).

Our demonstration that metformin and AICAR reduced the invasion activities of UOK262
cells (Figure 8C) is consistent with previous studies which showed that metformin and
AICAR inhibited the proliferation of various cancer cell lines (Buzzai et al., 2007; Hirsch et
al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2004), and that diabetics treated with metformin exhibited decreases
in cancer incidence (Evans et al., 2005). Metformin can inhibit tumorigenesis by activating
AMPK, and thereby inhibiting anabolic pathways (Shaw, 2006) and inducing apoptosis
(Buzzai et al., 2007). However, our findings also suggest another potential mechanism for
the anti-cancer effect of metformin: induction of DMT1 expression (Figure 5E) may
increase iron uptake, which may reduce HIF-1α levels and associated glycolysis, while
promoting oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids in cancer cells.
Interest in the Warburg effect (Vander Heiden et al., 2009; Warburg, 1956) has been
rekindled by the mounting appreciation for the growth advantages that glycolysis can confer
to tumor cells (Shaw, 2006; Vander Heiden et al., 2009; Warburg, 1956). In neoplasia,
oncogenic pathways may function to drive cell-autonomous nutrient uptake and anabolic
metabolism via aerobic glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). We propose that the
AMPK-dependent decrease in iron uptake in FH-deficient cells reflects a reversion to an
evolutionarily conserved pathway that coordinates glucose and iron metabolisms. Our
results suggest that a fundamental feature of HLRCC carcinogenesis involves reduced
AMPK activities, which mediate a global remodeling of anabolic processes and iron
metabolism to enhance cell proliferation and survival. The metabolic shift to aerobic
glycolysis described in this aggressive form of cancer could provide insight into the most
fundamental aspects of tumorigenesis and provide opportunities for the development of
improved diagnostics and therapeutics in tumors characterized by aerobic glycolysis and
impaired oxidative phosphorylation.

Cell cultures and animal studies
Kidney cell lines used in this study are summarized in Table S1. p53ind and control p53-cell
lines were generous gifts from the Torti lab (Wake Forest University). AMPK+/+ and
AMPK−/− MEFs were generous gifts from Dr Benoit Viollet (Université Paris Descartes,
CNRS). All cells were cultivated in DMEM containing 25 mM D-glucose, 1 mM pyruvate,
10% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Embryonic fibroblasts of 13-day-old
embryos were isolated from wild-type and IRP1−/− mice as previously described (LaVaute
et al., 2001). For xenograft studies, UOK 262 or UK262-WT cells (5×106) were injected
subcutaneously into 10 athymic nude mice and tumor growth was followed by
measurements of tumor volume over time. All protocols were approved by the NICHD
Animal Care and Use Committee and met NIH guidelines for the humane care of animals.

Immunoblots

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunoblots were performed on 1% Triton lysate, whole cell lysates (RIPA buffer or 4%
SDS in PBS) or nuclear extracts. Equal loading was assessed by Ponceau Red staining and
immunoblot with anti-tubulin or anti-CREB antibodies. Antibodies are described in
supplementary information.
IRP activity assays
Assay samples containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 40mM KCl. 5% glycerol, 0.1U/uL
SuperRNAsine (Ambion), 0.3 uL/uL yeast tRNA, 2.5 mM DTT and 10 nM P32-labelled IRE
of human ferritin H chain and 10 ug protein were loaded onto a 8% acrylamide/TBE gel and
run at 200 V for 5 hr at room temperature. Equal loading was assessed by immunoblot with
IRPs and anti-tubulin antibodies.
Measurements of metabolic status

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were cultured in custom XF96 microplates (Seahorse Bioscience). Respiration and
glycolysis cause rapid changes to the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and free protons in
the medium above a monolayer of cells, which are measured by solid state sensor probes in
the XF96 Analyzer. Glucose (25mM) was injected at the indicated time-points into each
well after baseline rate measurement. Analysis of TCA cycle intermediates, ATP and AMP
were performed using GC/MS analyses of 6 samples by Metabolon, Inc.
Invasion assays
RT-CIM cell invasion and migration monitoring system (ACEA Biosciences, CA) was used
to measure invasion of UOK262 cells transfected by electroporation (AMAXA) with 10 uM
of HIF-1α siRNA or mock RNA, or UOK262 cells treated with 2 mM metformin or 1 mM
AICAR. One day post-transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight before being plated
in the upper chambers, whereas the lower chambers contained media with 10% serum.
Impedance signals from invasive cells passing through the membrane between the chambers
were recorded in real-time to provide quantitative information about number of migrating
cells.
Human materials
All human subjects work was approved by NCI Institutional Review Board Committee.
Renal tumors from patients affected with HLRCC were removed surgically at NIH.
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Patients were evaluated on approved NCIIRB protocols 97-C-0147 and/or 03-C-0066.

Data analysis
All data are representative of 3 or more independent experiments. Statistical analyses were
performed by Student's t test for paired samples.
Significance
A hallmark of tumor cells is the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to
aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). Herein, we demonstrate that inactivation of the
TCA cycle drives a glycolytic shift and decreases the levels of the master metabolic
regulator, AMPK. Increased glycolysis confers growth advantages by diverting glucose
to generate NADPH, acetyl-CoA, and ribose; reduced AMPK signaling suppresses p53
expression and activates factors involved in protein and fatty acid biosynthesis.
Furthermore, reduced AMPK signaling decreases the expression of the DMT1 iron
transporter, which contributes to elevation of HIF-1α, a key activator of glycolysis.

Figure 2. Evidence for glycolysis-associated cytosolic iron deficiency and IRP activation in FHdeficient cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Schematics for iron-dependent regulation of IRP1 and IRP2. When iron is abundant,
IRP2 is degraded, whereas IRP1 is converted to cytosolic aconitase (c-ACO). When iron is
scarce, IRP2 is stabilized whereas IRP1 loses its Fe-S cluster, and both IRPs bind to IREs
with high affinity.

cells measured using the RT-CIM cell invasion monitoring system.
(C) Effect of treatment with the AMPK activators metformin and AICAR on the invasion
activities of UOK262 cells.
(D) A working model for FH-deficient cells, in which impairment of the TCA cycle imposes
a need to shift energy production from respiration to glycolysis, and induces an AMPKdependent decrease in p53 and activation of anabolic factors ACC and S6. Reduced AMPK
levels decrease expression of the DMT1 iron transporter, resulting in reduced iron uptake
and activation of IRPs. While reduced cytosolic iron levels and fumarate accumulation are
expected to inhibit PHDs and stabilize both HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins, activation of IRPs
would selectively repress HIF-2α translation and attenuate the potential increase in HIF-2α
proteins. The increased expression of HIF-1α and glycolytic shift, coupled to decreases of
