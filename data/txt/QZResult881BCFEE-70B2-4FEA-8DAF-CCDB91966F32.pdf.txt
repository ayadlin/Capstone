ABSTRACT
The prostanoid thromboxane (TX) A2 is increasingly implicated in neoplastic
progression, including prostate cancer (PCa). Mechanistically, we recently identified
protein kinase C-related kinase (PRK) 1 as a functional interactant of both the TP`
and TPβ isoforms of the human T prostanoid receptor (TP). The interaction with
PRK1 was not only essential for TP`/TPβ-induced PCa cell migration but also enabled
the TXA2-TP axis to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr11 (H3Thr11),
an epigenetic marker both essential for and previously exclusively associated
with androgen-induced chromatin remodelling and transcriptional activation.
PRK1 is a member of a subfamily of three structurally related kinases comprising
PRK1/PKN`, PRK2/PKNγ and PRK3/PKNβ that are widely yet differentially implicated
in various cancers. Hence, focusing on the setting of prostate cancer, this study
investigated whether TP` and/or TPβ might also complex with PRK2 and PRK3 to
regulate their activity and neoplastic responses. While TP` and TPβ were found
in immune complexes with PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 to regulate their activation and
signalling, they do so differentially and in a TP agonist-regulated manner dependent
on the T-loop activation status of the PRKs but independent of their kinase activity.
Furthermore, TXA2-mediated neoplastic responses in prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3
cells, including histone H3Thr11 phosphorylation, was found to occur through a
PRK1- and PRK2-, but not PRK3-, dependent mechanism. Collectively, these data
suggest that TXA2 acts as both a neoplastic and epigenetic regulator and provides a
mechanistic explanation, at least in part, for the prophylactic benefits of Aspirin in
reducing the risk of certain cancers.

are implicated in a range of cardiovascular diseases [1, 2].
Hence, inhibiting TXA2 synthesis, action or both through
use of Aspirin or TP antagonists is a key therapeutic
strategy in the management of many diseases involving
TXA2, including atherothrombosis and acute coronary
syndrome.
By now, numerous studies have demonstrated
increased expression of COX-1 and COX-2 and of their
prostanoid metabolites in a range of cancers [3]. In support
of this, several longitudinal studies show that long-term
daily use of Aspirin reduces the risk of many prevalent
cancers including of the colon, oesophagus, lung and
prostate [4–6]. While such studies do not specify which

INTRODUCTION
The prostanoid thromboxane (TX) A2, synthesized
from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of
cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 and TXA2 synthase
predominantly in platelets and macrophages, plays a
central role within the vasculature dynamically regulating
platelet activation status and vascular tone [1, 2]. TXA2
is also a potent pro-inflammatory and pro-mitogenic
mediator promoting smooth muscle cell proliferation and
restenosis in response to endothelial damage/vessel injury.
In keeping with this, dysregulation of the levels of TXA2,

RhoA and P13’K/PDK-1 signalling [37, 38]. However,
while structurally related, the individual PRKs are
functionally distinct and are each recognized as
promising chemotherapeutic targets with several clinical
trials underway, particularly for pancreatic and prostate
cancers [39, 40]. For example, PRK2/PKNγ was recently
implicated in triple negative breast cancer [41] and in
controlling the migration and invasion of bladder tumour
cells [42]. PRK3/PKNβ is required for invasive prostate
cancer growth downstream of RhoC/PI3’K [43, 44] and
Atu027, a siRNA-liposome complex targeting PRK3, has
advanced to Phase II clinical trials for pancreatic cancer
[40]. Due to its ability to directly interact with and be
activated by the androgen receptor (AR), PRK1/PKNα
has been strongly implicated in androgen-associated
prostate cancer and in ovarian serous carcinoma [45–47].
In fact, by catalyzing histone H3 Thr11 phosphorylation
in response to AR activation, PRK1 has been dubbed
a “gate-keeper” of androgen-induced transcriptional
activation and, therefore, of androgen-driven prostate
cancer. Hence, PRK1 is now recognized as a key target
in androgen-responsive prostate cancer, including in
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the metastatic
and lethal form of the disease that occurs following
androgen deprivation therapy [47–49].
As stated, we recently identified PRK1 as a highly
specific interactant of both TPα and TPβ [35]. Critically,
the interaction was found to be functionally important
not only in mediating TXA2-induced migratory responses
but also revealed that, similar to that which occurs for
the AR, signalling through PRK1 enables the TXA2-TP
axis to induce chromatin remodeling (histone H3 Thr11
phosphorylation) in the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line and,
in addition, to both mimic and augment androgen-induced
responses in the LNCaP cell line [35]. This was the first
demonstration that agents other than androgens, in this case
TXA2, can induce histone H3 Thr11 phosphorylation, a
PRK1-catalysed epigenetic marker essential for chromatin
remodeling and transcriptional activation including in
CRPC [47–49]. Therefore, given the increasing evidence
of the link between elevated TXA2 signalling and TP
expression with various cancers including, but not limited
to prostate cancer, coupled with the recognized role
of the Gα12-mediated RhoA/PRK1 signalling cascade
in cancer, discovery of a direct, functional interaction
between TPα and TPβ with PRK1 [35] provided an
additional, previously unknown, mechanistic explanation
for the “link between the COX-1/2 derived metabolite
TXA2 and certain prevalent cancers”. However, that
study was confined to PRK1 [35]. Hence, owing to the
clear mechanistic and functional differences between the
individual PRKs, be it PRK1/PKNα, PRK2/PKNγ and
PRK3/PKNβ, combined with the increasing recognition
of the importance of the TXA2-TP axis in various
cancers, it was deemed imperative to investigate whether
TPα and/or TPβ might also associate with and, thereby,

COX-metabolite(s) are affected by Aspirin to account for
its prophylactic benefits, particular attention has recently
been directed to the role of TXA2, TXA2 synthase and its
T prostanoid receptor/TP in various neoplasms [7]. For
example, in addition to COX-2, increased levels of TXA2
and expression of TXA2 synthase and of the TP have been
strongly correlated with bladder and colorectal cancer
[8–10] and with non-small cell lung cancer, where TXA2
is the main tumour-promoting COX-2 metabolite [11–13].
Increased expression of COX-2, TXA2 synthase and of the
TP has also been widely implicated in prostate cancer, with
direct correlation of protein expression with Gleason score
and pathologic stage [14, 15]. Within the cancer tissue,
expression of TXA2 synthase and the TP localizes to areas
of perineural invasion, a recognized mechanism whereby
prostate cancer cells penetrate the prostatic capsule and
spread to other tissues [7, 14].
In humans and other primates, TXA2 signals
through two structurally related receptor isoforms,
referred to as TPα and TPβ, that differ exclusively in their
carboxyl-terminal (C)-tail domains [16]. While TPα and
TPβ are encoded by the same gene (the TBXA2R), they
are differentially expressed in a range of cell/tissue types
and are under the transcriptional regulation of two distinct
promoters designated Prm1 and Prm3, respectively
[17–23]. Consistent with this, in the setting of prostate
and breast cancer, the tumour suppressors Wilms’ tumour
(WT)-1 and hypermethylated in cancer (HIC)-1 bind to
cis-elements within Prm1 to regulate TPα expression
[24]. However, the factors regulating TPβ in those clinical
settings remain to be identified. Functionally, as members
of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily,
TPα and TPβ primarily couple to Gαq-phospholipase
(PL) Cβ and to Gα12-RhoA activation [25, 26].
In addition, TPα and TPβ both lead to similar activation
of the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK)
and phosphatidylinositol 3’kinase (PI3’K) signalling
cascades [27–29], but undergo distinct mechanisms of
agonist-induced homologous [30, 31] and heterologous
desensitization [32–34]. Hence, mechanistically, in the
context of cancer, it is proposed that TP-mediated RhoA
activation plays a critical role in the TXA2-induced tumour
cell migration and metastasis while its ability to regulate
the PI3’K and ERK cascades, including transactivation
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), may
account for the influence of TXA2 on tumour cell
proliferation/mitogenesis [7, 26–29].
Through additional mechanistic studies, we
recently discovered that both TPα and TPβ directly
interact with and regulate signalling by protein kinase
C-related kinase (PRK) 1 [35], a RhoA effector
widely implicated in prostate cancer. The PRKs, also
referred to as protein kinase novel (PKN), constitute a
subfamily of three structurally related yet functionally
distinct Ser/Thr AGC kinases comprising PRK1/PKNα,
PRK2/PKNγ and PRK3/PKNβ [36], downstream of

regulate signalling by PRK2 or PRK3. Hence, focusing
on the setting of prostate cancer, the aim of this study was
to explore whether TPα and/or TPβ might also complex
with and regulate the activity, neoplastic (proliferative and
migratory) responses and, potentially, histone H3 Thr11
phosphorylation through PRK2 and PRK3. We reveal that
while TPα and TPβ are found in functional complexes
with PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 to regulate PRK activation
status and signalling, they do so differentially and in a TP
agonist-regulated manner and dependent on the T-loop
activation status of the PRKs but independent of their
kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that TXA2-mediated
neoplastic responses in prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3
cells, including histone H3 Thr11 phosphorylation, occurs
through a PRK1- and PRK2-, but not PRK3-, dependent
mechanism.

TPβ, but not with TPα (Figure 1B & 1C). In response
to U46619, PRK2 transiently complexed with TPα
following 10 min stimulation, which diminished upon
prolonged treatment for 60 min (Figure 1B & 1C). In
contrast, while PRK2 complexed with TPβ in the absence
of agonist, U46619 led to dissociation of the complex at
10 min, but at 60 min, levels of the TPβ:PRK2 complex
were restored to that observed in the absence of agonist
(Figure 1B & 1C). In the case of PRK3, it did not complex
with TPα or TPβ in PC-3 cells either constitutively or
following TP stimulation (Figure 1B).
To explore the possibility that the associations,
or lack-of, between TPα and TPβ with the PRKs might
be cell-type specific, TP:PRK complex formation was
also examined in HEK293 cell lines that over-express
TPα (HEK.TPα cells) or TPβ (HEK.TPβ cells) and the
individual PRKs [33–35]. Consistent with findings in
PC-3 cells, PRK1 strongly associated with both TPα and
TPβ and the nett-association was not significantly altered
in response to agonist-stimulation (Figure 2A, & 2C).
Furthermore, while PRK2 did not associate constitutively
with TPα, stimulation with U46619 for 10 min
led to its transient association which was lost at
60 min post-stimulation (Figure 2A, & 2C), while the
constitutive association of PRK2 with TPβ was lost at
10 min but restored at 60 min post-agonist stimulation
(Figure 2A, & 2C). In the case of PRK3, unlike that which
occurred in PC-3 cells, it complexed constitutively with
both TPα and TPβ and in an agonist-regulated manner
in the HEK293 cell lines. Specifically, the constitutive
association of PRK3 with TPα was lost at 10 min but
restored following U46619 stimulation for 30 min or
60 min (Figure 2A, & 2C). For TPβ, its constitutive
association with PRK3 observed in the absence of agonist
was largely unaffected following U46619-stimulation
(Figure 2B, & 2C).
Structurally, the PRKs contain three highly
conserved regions including an N-terminal Rho
binding domain (RBD), a centrally located arachidonic
acid-sensitive C2-like auto-inhibitory domain and
a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain [36, 50].
To investigate whether the observed associations may
involve direct association(s) between the TPs and PRKs,
immune complexes generated between TPα and TPβ with
the PRKs or with their corresponding RBD, RBD + C2
or kinase subdomains were investigated, including in
response to short-term agonist-activation with U46619
(Figure 2D & 2E & Supplemental Figure 1). Consistent
with previous findings [35], PRK1 associated with
TPα and TPβ predominantly via its carboxy-terminal
region incorporating its C2-like domain and catalytic
kinase domain, while no association occurred with the
N-terminal RBD. While the association of both TPα and
TPβ with the full length PRK1 was largely unaffected by
the activation status of the TPs, some differences were

RESULTS
Association of PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 with
TPα and TPβ
PRK1 was recently identified as a highly specific
and functionally important interacting partner of both TPα
and TPβ in prostate cancer cells [35]. Hence, focusing on
the setting of prostate cancer, the aim of this study was
to investigate whether TPα and/or TPβ might associate
with and regulate the activity, including neoplastic
responses, through PRK2/PKNγ and PRK3/PKNβ,
AGC kinases that like PRK1/PKNα act downstream
of RhoA and PI3’K/PDK1 oncogenic signalling. To
begin, the ability of PRK1, PRK2 or PRK3 to form
complexes with TPα and TPβ in the metastatic prostate
adenocarcinoma PC-3 cell line was investigated through
co-immunoprecipitations using anti-TPα and anti-TPβ
isoform-specific antibodies [26, 29]. Consistent with
previous findings [35], PRK1 was detected in complexes
with both TPα and TPβ, but not in control pre-immune
IgG immunoprecipitates (Figure 1A). For PRK2, it was
found in TPβ but not in TPα immune-complexes (Figure
1A). In contrast, PRK3 did not complex with either TPα
or TPβ in PC-3 cells, despite its expression, albeit at lower
levels than PRK1 or PRK2 (Figure 1A), and despite using
increased protein input in the assays (Data not shown).
Thereafter, the influence of receptor activation on
complex formation between the individual TPs and PRKs
was investigated using the highly selective TP agonist
U46619. Upon stimulation with U46619 for 0–60 min,
levels of PRK1 associated with TPα and TPβ in complexes
from PC-3 cells were not significantly altered relative
to constitutive/basal levels, in the absence of agonist
(Figure 1B & 1C). In contrast, the association of PRK2
with both TPα and TPβ was regulated in a time-dependent
manner in response to U46619 (Figure 1B & 1C). In the
absence of agonist, PRK2 was found in complex with

observed in their association with the C-terminal domains
as a function of agonist stimulation (Figure 2D & 2E). For
PRK2, consistent with findings in PC-3 cells (Figure 1B),
while it did not associate with TPα under basal conditions,
it did so in an agonist-dependent manner but, unlike that
of PRK1, required expression of the entire PRK2 for
association (Figure 2D). In contrast and consistent with
findings in PC-3 cells (Figure 1B), PRK2 associated with
TPβ in the absence of agonist through an association
requiring the entire PRK2 protein but following short-term
agonist stimulation, it dissociated from the TPβ complex
(Figure 2E). In the case of PRK3, while it associated
with TPα under constitutive/basal conditions through an
association dependent, at least in part, on its C-terminal
C2 and kinase domains, the interaction with the kinase
domain was substantially weaker requiring extended
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exposures for detection and diminished in response to
short-term agonist activation of TPα (Figure 2D & 2E, &
Insets). Finally, although PRK3 associated with TPβ again
through an association dependent on its C-terminal C2
and, in part, on its kinase domain, some differences were
observed in their associations as a function of agonist
stimulation. Hence, these data show that while both
PRK1 and PRK3 may associate with TPα and TPβ via
their C-terminal C2 and kinase domains, the association
between the TPs with PRK2 requires the presence of the
complete enzyme. Furthermore, the agonist-regulated
interaction between TPα and TPβ with PRK1, PRK2 and
PRK3 is both unique, but entirely consistent with previous
data (Figure 1B, 2A & 2B).

the selective TP antagonist SQ29,548 inhibited the
U46619-induced PRK activation further confirming TP
specificity (Supplemental Figure 3).
While TP-mediated PRK3 activation did
not occur in PC-3 cells, it was confirmed that the
anti-phospho-PRK1Thr774/PRK2Thr816/PRK3Thr718 antibody
can detect PRK3 when over-expressed in HEK293
cells (Supplemental Figure 4). Thereafter, TPα and/or
TPβ-induced activation of PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 was
investigated in the HEK293 cell lines over-expressing
TPα or TPβ and the individual PRKs. Consistent with
findings in PC-3 cells, both PRK1 and PRK2 but also
PRK3 underwent substantial T-loop phosphorylation
in response to agonist-induced activation of TPα and
TPβ (Figure 3D). Furthermore, inhibition of PI3′K and
PDK-1 impaired T-loop phosphorylation of the PRKs
in response to agonist-activation of both TPα and TPβ
(Supplemental Figure 5).
Collectively,
these
data
establish
that
agonist-activation of both TPα or TPβ leads to rapid and
sustained T-loop phosphorylation of the PRK isozymes
and which occurs through a PI3′K/ PDK1-dependent
mechanism.

TPβ which is not substantially regulated in response
to receptor stimulation. In addition, while PRK2 may
associate with TPβ, but not TPα, in the absence of
agonist, both these associations are dynamically regulated
in response to receptor activation. In the case of PRK3,
while no complex was observed between TPα or TPβ in
PC-3 cells, studies in HEK293 cells show that specific
complexes can occur, and which are regulated in an
agonist-dependent manner.

Influence of TP agonist stimulation on the
activation status of PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3
In addition to directly associating with PRK1,
agonist-activation of TPα and TPβ increases the activity
of PRK1 [35]. The PRK family of RhoA effectors
undergo activation through phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase (PDK)-1 phosphorylation of a critical Thr within
their kinase activation loops (T-loop phosphorylation)
in response to upstream PI3′K/PDK-1 signalling
[37, 38]. Hence, an anti-phospho-PRK1Thr774/
PRK2Thr816/PRK3Thr718 antibody which recognises the
phosphorylated, activated PRKs was used to monitor
PRK1–3 activation status in PC-3 cells in response to
stimulation with U46619. In the absence of agonist,
no significant basal phosphorylation of the PRKs
was detected (Figure 3A & 3B). Upon stimulation
with U46619 for 10–60 min, there was a rapid
appearance of a doublet band detected by the anti-phosphoPRK1Thr774/PRK2Thr816/PRK3Thr718, which co-migrated
with species corresponding to the activated forms
of PRK1 (lower band) and PRK2 (upper band)
(Figure 3A & 3B). The identity of the PRKs and
specificity of the phospho-PRK antibody was
demonstrated through use of silencing (si)RNAs
whereby specific knockdown of PRK1 and PRK2, but
not PRK3, impaired detection of the U46619-induced
phosphorylated PRK1 and PRK2 species, respectively
(Figure 3C & Supplemental Figure 2A). In addition,
all data were validated using at least two independent
siRNAs to each of PRK1–3 (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Thereafter, the involvement of the upstream kinases,
PI3’K and PDK-1, in the TP-mediated activation of
PRK1 and PRK2, was confirmed whereby inhibition
of PI3’K and PDK-1, but not of the second messengerregulated protein kinase (PK) A or PKC, impaired
T-loop phosphorylation/activation of PRK1 and PRK2
in response to U46619 stimulation (Figure 3A & 3B).
In addition, inclusion of the pan-PRK inhibitor PKC412
impaired the sustained T-loop phosphorylation/activation
of PRK1 and PRK2 in response to U46619 stimulation
(Figure 3A & 3B). Furthermore, U46619-induced PRK1
and PRK2 activation in PC-3 cells was both time and
concentration dependent, where stimulation of cells with
250 nM U46619 for 60 min was found to be optimal
(Supplemental Figure 3), while pre-incubation with

Role of the kinase activity and activation
status of the PRKs on their association
with TPα and TPβ
Findings herein have established that the association
and T-loop activation status of the PRKs with TPα/TPβ
are dynamically regulated in response to agonist-induced
receptor activation. Hence, it was next sought to
investigate whether the activity and/or the activation
status of the PRKs may play a role in their respective
agonist-regulated associations with TPα and TPβ.
For this end, the ability of either the wild-type,
kinase-defective (PRK1K644E, PRK2K686E, PRK3K588E),
or T-loop phosphorylation-defective (PRK1T774A,
PRK2T816A, PRK3T718A) forms of PRK1–3 to form
complexes with either TPα or TPβ was investigated in
HEK.TPα and HEK.TPβ cells, respectively. The level
and pattern of agonist-regulated associations of each
of the kinase-defective PRK variants with either TPα
or TPβ was not significantly different from those of
the wild-type PRK1–3 (Figure 4A–4D). In the case of
the T-loop phosphorylation defective PRK variants, in the
absence of agonist, PRK1T774A was capable of associating
with TPα and TPβ (Figure 4A & 4C; T774A). However,
in response to U46619 stimulation, the association of
PRK1T774A with both TPα and TPβ was lost/diminished in
a time-dependent manner, being decreased at 10 min and
further reduced or absent following prolonged stimulation
(Figure 4A & 4C; T774A). Furthermore, neither PRK2T816A
nor PRK3T718A associated with TPα or TPβ complexes,
either in the absence of agonist or upon TP stimulation
(Figure 4A & 4C; T816A & T718A).

Influence of TP agonist- activation on PRK1/2/3mediated PC-3 cell proliferation and migration

Taken together, these data indicate that while the
kinase activity per se does not influence the association of
the PRKs with TPα/TPβ, their T-loop phosphorylation, a
measure of their activation status, is critical in determining
the ability of the PRKs to associate or complex with
TPα and TPβ. In addition, while previous reports [35]
indicated that the TP:PRK1 association was not regulated
in response to TP stimulation, data herein involving the
T-loop phosphorylation-defective PRK1T774A suggest that
sustained association of PRK1 with both TPα and TPβ is
dependent on its activation status.

The PRK isozymes each play an essential role in
neoplastic processes, including in cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion [42, 43]. In addition, disruption of
PRK1 expression impairs TP-mediated PC-3 cell migration
[35]. Hence, herein, the influence of the individual PRKs
on TP-mediated prostate cancer cell responses, including
cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth (colony
formation) and migration was investigated.

Stimulation with U46619 led to time- and
concentration-dependent increases in proliferation, colony
formation and migration of PC-3 cells with optimal
responses occurring at 10–50 nM U46619 in all cases
(Supplemental Figure 6). Furthermore, the specificity
that U46619 mediated these effects through the TP was
confirmed whereby the selective TP antagonist SQ29,548
blocked each of these U46619-induced responses in PC-3
cells (Supplemental Figure 6).
To determine the role of the individual PRKs
on TP-mediated prostate cancer cell responses, the
effect of siRNA-targeted disruption of the individual
PRKs on U46619-induced responses in PC-3 cells was
examined. Specific siRNA-disruption of both PRK1 and
PRK2 expression in PC-3 cells significantly impaired
U46619-induced cell proliferation, colony formation
and cell migration, while siRNA-disruption of PRK3
or control scrambled siRNA sequences had no effect
on these U46619-induced responses (Figures 5A–5C).
The specificity of the individual siRNA sequences to
specifically disrupt PRK1, PRK2 and PRK3 expression,
and for prolonged periods (up to 6 day post-transfection),

was confirmed through western blotting (Figure 5D &

Influence of TP agonist- activation on
PRK1/2/3-mediated Histone H3Thr11
phosphorylation
It has been recently established that
agonist-activation of TPα and TPβ can, in turn, lead to
PRK1-catalysed H3Thr11 phosphorylation in prostate
cancer cells, representing the first demonstration
that agents other than androgens can induce this key
epigenetic modification and recognized gate-keeper
of

activation
[35, 47]. Hence, given our demonstration that the TPs
may also associate with and modulate the activity
and downstream  signalling of the PRKs, including
neoplastic responses, it was sought to explore whether
TP-mediated activation of PRK2 and/or PRK3 may
also lead to phosphorylation of H3Thr11 in PC-3 cells.

using a specific anti-phospho-H3Thr11 antibody, where

PC-3 cells growth-arrested in metaphase with colcemid
served as a positive control for H3Thr11 phosphorylation
(Supplemental Figure 7A). Consistent with previous
data (Supplemental Figure 6), 50 nM U46619 was
the optimal agonist concentration required to induce
H3Thr11 phosphorylation through the TPs (Supplemental
Figure 7A). Furthermore, stimulation of PC-3 cells with
50 nM U46619 led to a time-dependent increase in
H3Thr11 phosphorylation and the selective TP antagonist
SQ29,548 specifically inhibited the U46619-induced
H3Thr11 phosphorylation, confirming TP specificity
(Supplemental Figure 7B). In addition, treatment with the
vehicle alone did not bring about an increase in H3Thr11
phosphorylation (Supplemental Figure 7B).
Specific siRNA-disruption of both PRK1 and
PRK2 expression in PC-3 cells significantly impaired
U46619-induced H3Thr11 phosphorylation, while
siRNA-disruption of PRK3 or siRNA scrambled

control sequences had no effect (Figure 6). In all cases,
rescreening of the anti-phospho-H3Thr11 blots with
anti-histone H3 antibody confirmed that any differences in
H3Thr11 phosphorylation were not due to discrepancies in
histone H3 levels (Figure 6).

on PRK1 and PRK2, but not on PRK3, in mediating
TP-induced neoplastic responses, including cell
proliferation, migration and H3Thr11 phosphorylation, in
PC-3 cells. Moreover, siRNA-targeted disruption studies
showed near-on equivalent dependence on either PRK1 or
PRK2 in inducing these TP-mediated responses, despite
substantial differences in the levels of PRK1 versus PRK2

their agonist-regulated associations with TPα and TPβ
(Figure 1). Due to these findings, it was sought to establish
whether expression of PRK1 in PC-3 cells might influence
the association of TPα/TPβ with PRK2 or vice versa.
Hence, the effect of siRNA-mediated disruption of PRK1
and PRK2 on their ability to complex with TPα and TPβ
in the absence or presence of U46619 (10 min) stimulation
was investigated through co-immunoprecipitations
from PC-3 cells where cells transfected with scrambled
siRNA sequences served as controls (Figure 7). Notably,
upon siRNA-disruption of PRK1 expression, PRK2 was
not found to associate with TPα or TPβ either in the
presence or absence of TP agonist (Figure 7). However,
upon knockdown of PRK2 expression, levels of PRK1
complexed with TPα or TPβ were not significantly
affected and were comparable to control levels in the
presence of siRNAControl (Figure 7). These data suggest
that the association that exists between PRK1 with either
TPα or TPβ is independent of the expression of and/or
potential association with PRK2. However, these data
also suggest that expression and/or prior association
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of PRK1 with TPα and TPβ may be a prerequisite for
association of PRK2 with the TPs. Specifically, both the
agonist-dependent association of PRK2 with TPα or the
constitutive interaction of PRK2 with TPβ is dependent on
the expression of PRK1 and/or on the association of PRK1
in complex with either TPα or TPβ.

DISCUSSION
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the
principal treatment for patients with locally advanced,
relapsed or metastatic prostate cancer [48]. Despite
initial success, many men eventually fail this therapy
and metastatic prostate cancer develops to the final
castrate-resistant stage, for which no cure is available
and only palliative therapy can be given [51]. Hence,
increased understanding of the mechanisms that underlie
CRPC is needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches
for this disease [48]. Although the AR can remain
functional and continue to be activated during CRPC,
other androgen-independent signalling pathways also play

a key role including disturbed growth factor signalling
and survival pathways [51]. Key among the findings
which may account for the aberrant activation of the AR
in prostate cancer was the discovery that, in addition to
classical ligand-binding mechanisms, transcriptional
activity of the AR is controlled through its direct binding
to the RhoA effectors PRK1 and PRK2 [46]. In fact, as
stated, by catalysing H3Thr11 phosphorylation in response
to androgen signalling, PRK1 functions as a gatekeeper of
AR-regulated gene expression and, in turn, of deleterious
growth of prostate cancer [47]. Moreover, PRK1 can
control the transcriptional activation of AR-target genes
even in the absence of testicular androgens or in the
presence of anti-androgens, highlighting a role for PRK1
in prostate tumour growth and spread which occurs during
ADT and CRPC [46].
There is significant evidence to support the role
of the COX-1/2-derived TXA2 in tumour progression
and metastasis, including within the prostate [7, 14, 52].
Mechanistically, TP-mediated RhoA activation plays a
critical role in the TXA2-induced tumour cell migration
and metastasis while its ability to regulate the PI3’K and
ERK cascades may account for the influence of TXA2
on tumour cell proliferation/mitogenesis [7, 26–29].
In addition, we recently discovered a novel signalling
pathway in prostate tumour cells involving the direct
interaction of both TPα and TPβ with PRK1 [35].
Critically, this discovery revealed that agonist-stimulation
of TPα/TPβ can directly activate PRK1 and established
for the first time that agents other than androgens can
induce chromatin remodelling through PRK1- mediated
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr11 [35]. Moreover,
it was established that TXA2-mediated PRK1 signalling
can both mimic and augment androgen-induced H3Thr11
phosphorylation and cell migration in prostate cancer,
providing a previously unknown functional link between
the TXA2- TPα/TPβ signalling axis and the AR [35].
As stated, PRK1/PKNα, along with PRK2/PKNγ
and PRK3/PKNβ, are members of a family of structurally
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

related, yet functionally distinct Ser/Thr AGC kinases
which, like PRK1, are strongly implicated in tumour
promotion including within but not limited to the prostate
[42, 43, 46]. Hence, focusing within the setting of prostate
cancer, we sought to investigate whether, like PRK1,
PRK2 and PRK3 might also associate with TPα and/or
TPβ to mediate TXA2-induced chromatin remodelling
and cell growth/metastasis, thereby gaining a greater
mechanistic insight into how the TXA2-TP signalling
axis, and target of Aspirin, can contribute to prostate
tumorigenesis. In our study, we provide evidence that
TPα and TPβ can form complexes/associate with all three
of the PRK isozymes, but that the association occurs in
a cell-specific manner whereby PRK1 and PRK2 can
both associate with TPα/TPβ endogenously expressed
in the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line, while PRK3 only
associates with TPα/TPβ when over-expressed in HEK293
cells. However, the associations between TPα/TPβ with
both PRK2 and PRK3 are both structurally distinct and
highly regulated in response to agonist-stimulation of the
TPs. Studies with the individual subdomains of the PRKs
suggest that the associations with PRK1 and PRK3, either
in the absence or presence of agonist, are predominantly
dependent on their C-terminal C2 and kinase domains, but
the association with PRK2 requires the presence of the
complete enzyme for complex formation with TPα/TPβ.
The molecular basis of the differential associations
between the TPs and PRKs is currently unknown and will
require additional investigations, such as through detailed
biophysical studies of the complexes to define/identify the
main structural motifs/residues involved.
Based on our findings with the full-length PRKs,
we propose a model (Figure 8A) whereby, under
constitutive/basal conditions in the absence of agonist,
PRK1 and/or PRK3 is recruited into a complex with both
of the TPα and TPβ isoforms, while PRK2 distinctly
forms a complex only with that of TPβ. In response to
short-term U46619/TXA2-induced receptor activation
(e.g at 10 min), while there is no measurable alteration

Figure 8: Proposed model of the association of TPα/TPβ with PRK1-3, and the implications for prostate tumour
progression. Panel A. In the prostate carcinoma PC-3 cell line, under constitutive/basal conditions PRK1 is recruited into a complex

with both the TPα (i) and TPβ (ii) isoforms while PRK2 distinctly forms a complex only with that of TPβ. Following short-term agonist
(U46619)-stimulation of TPα/TPβ (10 min), whereas there is no measurable alteration in the level of PRK1 associated with either TP
isoform, a change occurs whereby PRK2 dissociates from TPβ (ii), while transiently associating into a complex with TPα (i). Following
prolonged agonist-activation of TPα/TPβ (60 min), PRK2 dissociates from TPα (i) and is recruited once more into a complex with TPβ
(ii). Hence, the PRK:TPα (i) and PRK:TPβ (ii) complexes observed at 60 min post-agonist mimic those found basally, in the absence
of agonist. Although not found to occur in PC-3 cells, PRK3 also has the ability to associate with TPα (i) and TPβ (ii), such-as when
co-expressed in HEK293 cells. In response to receptor stimulation, while there is no measurable alteration in the level of PRK3 associated
with TPβ (ii), PRK3 transiently dissociates from TPα (i) at 10 min post-agonist before re-associating following prolonged agonist
stimulation (60 min). Agonist-stimulation of both TPα and TPβ leads to T-loop phosphorylation-dependent activation of PRK1, PRK2
and PRK3, where each of the kinases remain in the activated state for at least 60 min post-agonist. Thus, while PRK2 and PRK3, but
not PRK1, transiently associate/disassociate from the given TPα/TPβ complex in response to agonist stimulation, the agonist-induced
phosphorylation & activation of each of the PRKs is more sustained. Panel B. In PC-3 cells, TPα/TPβ is found associated in a complex
with both PRK1 and PRK2. Agonist-activation of TPα/TPβ leads to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′kinase (PI3’K) and, in turn, to
activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), the master-regulator AGC kinase that leads to subsequent activation
of the PRKs through phosphorylation of the essential Thr within their activation loop (T-loop phosphorylation). Critically, in response to
TPα/TPβ stimulation, activation of both PRK1 and PRK2 leads to chromatin remodelling (H3Thr11 phosphorylation) in prostate cells and
to enhanced cell proliferation and migration, thereby exacerbating the pathological state in prostate cancer. Note; TPα/TPβ-regulation of
Gq/PLCβ, G12/Rho or of the ERK signalling cascades are not shown.

coinciding with/facilitating the recruitment of PRK2

agonist-activation of TPα/TPβ, PRK2 dissociates from
TPα and is recruited once more into a complex with
TPβ, while the association between TPβ and PRK3 is
also restored. Furthermore, signalling through TPα/
TPβ leads to T-loop phosphorylation and activation

their T-loop phosphorylation which occurs in response
to U46619-induced receptor activation. Therefore,
it appears that through their ability to associate with
TPα/TPβ, in response to receptor activation PRK1/2
undergoes enhanced PDK1-dependent phosphorylation
at its T-loop, a phosphorylation event that is critical for
regulating/stabilizing the association of TPα/TPβ with
the PRKs.
Of crucial importance to the current study is that in
response to receptor stimulation, activation of both PRK1
and PRK2 are involved in H3Thr11 phosphorylation, cell
proliferation/migration in PC-3 cells, thereby providing
evidence for the additional role of PRK2 in mediating
TXA2-induced chromatin remodelling and malignant
growth/metastasis in prostate cancer. From a mechanistic
point of view, phosphorylation of H3Thr11 by PRK1
and/or by the related PRK2 accelerates the demethylation
of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) by the de-methylases
JMJD2C and lysine specific de-methylase (LSD) 1,
thereby promoting AR-dependent gene expression
and cellular growth and migration in prostate cancer
[47, 53, 54]. In addition, it was recently established that
PRK1-induced phosphorylated H3Thr11 serves as a
binding platform for the WDR5 (WD-repeat containing
protein 5) component of the WRAD complex, thereby
leading to recruitment of the MLL1 methyltransferase
complex, and consequent trimethylation of H3K4 and
transcriptional activation of AR-target genes [55]. Our
discovery, therefore, that signalling through TPα/TPβ can
lead to PRK1/PRK2-induced H3Thr11 phosphorylation
is truly exciting, and clearly highlights a potentially
important role for TPα and/or TPβ in chromatin
remodelling/epigenetic regulation in tumour progression.
Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that these
TPα/TPβ-mediated effects may account, at least in part,
for the clinically well-documented observation that during
prostate cancer progression, AR-target gene expression is
up-regulated even in the absence of testicular androgens
or in the presence of AR antagonists, such as in the case
of CRPC. It will therefore be of significant interest to
now investigate whether TPα/TPβ- mediated PRK1/2
activation can lead to further chromatin modifications in
prostate cells, including recruitment of the MLL1 complex
and subsequent trimethylation of H3K4, thereby leading
to an altered gene expression programme in prostate
tumour cells. The importance of the PRK family members
in transcriptional regulation is further endorsed by recent
reports that key members of class IIa histone deacetylases
are phosphorylated by PRK1/2. More specifically,
HDAC−5, −7 and −9 but not −4 are phosphorylated by
PRK1/2 within their nuclear localisation signal, thereby
impairing histone deacetylase nuclear transport and
promotion of transcriptional activation [56].
Interestingly, through interactions involving
its N-terminal domain, PRK2 is known to form
homodimers, also raising the possibility of the existence

of PRK1 and PRK2 in PC-3 cells and this occurs in a
mechanism-dependent on PI3′K/PDK1. Thus, while
PRK2, but not PRK1, transiently associate/disassociate
from the given TPα/TPβ complex in response to agonist
stimulation, the agonist-induced T-loop phosphorylation
& activation of each of these PRKs is more sustained.
Critically, we also show that both PRK1 and PRK2, but not
PRK3, are essential in mediating TXA2/U46619-induced
chromatin remodelling (H3Thr11 phosphorylation)
and neoplastic responses (cell proliferation, anchorage
independent growth/colony formation, and cell migration)
in prostate cancer cells. Hence, TP-mediated prostate
tumour responses not only involves PRK1, but is also
dependent on signalling through the related PRK2,
involving a unique and dynamic series of complexes
regulated in response to agonist-activation of the TPs.
Notably, following multiple attempts PRK3 did
not form a complex with TPα or TPβ in PC-3 cells,
despite showing associations in HEK293 cells that can
be agonist-regulated and dependent on the C-terminal
C2 and kinase domains of PRK3. Given the relatively
lower expression of PRK3 in PC-3 cells, one possible
explanation is that TPα/TPβ might preferentially associate
with the more abundant PRK1 and PRK2 in this prostate
cell line. However, even in the absence of PRK1 and
PRK2 expression, following their specific disruption by
siRNAs, PRK3 was not found to associate with TPα or
TPβ in PC-3 cells (data not shown). Another possibility
might be that there is a missing functional element in
prostate cells, which would otherwise facilitate the
association of TPα/TPβ with PRK3. Interestingly, a recent
study has revealed that RhoC predominately associates
with PRK3 in prostate cells leading to metastatic prostate
tumour growth downstream of a hyperactive PI3’K
pathway [44]. Hence, PRK3 may function as an effector of
another branch of the PI3’K oncogenic signalling network
in prostate cancer, which is potentially independent of
the TXA2-TPα/TPβ signalling axis [43, 44]. While our
data have provided evidence for the propensity of both
TPα and TPβ to associate with and regulate PRK3, the
biological significance of these findings remains to be
clarified and will be the subject of future investigations.
Specifically, it will be of interest to investigate the role of
the TPα/TPβ-mediated PRK3 signalling in other neoplastic
settings where both TXA2 and PRK3 are implicated.
As illustrated in the model in Figure 8B,
TXA2/U46619-induced activation of the PRKs occurs
in a mechanism dependent on signalling through PI3′K
and subsequent activation of the master-regulatory AGC
kinase PDK1, leading to T-loop phosphorylation and
activation of PRK1/2 [37, 38]. These findings are entirely
consistent with the established role for TPα/TPβ in the
activation of both class 1A and class 1B PI3’K signalling
cascades [27–29]. Furthermore, mutational analysis of
the PRKs reveals that the stability of the complex formed
between TPα/TPβ and the PRKs is dependent upon

significant, and highlights the potential for TPα and/or
TPβ as a therapeutic target in the treatment of prostate
cancer including CRPC and potentially in other cancers
in which aberrant TP:PRK1 and/or PRK2 signalling is
implicated. Furthermore, our study provides a mechanistic
explanation, at least in part, for the prophylactic benefits
of Aspirin in reducing certain cancer risks by lowering
overall TXA2 levels.

of heterodimers between members of the structurally
related PRK family [57]. Hence, given our discovery that
TXA2-induced H3Thr11 phosphorylation, as well as cell
proliferation/migration appear to be almost equivalently
dependent on signalling through both PRK1 and PRK2,
despite differences in their relative expression levels and
modes of regulation in PC-3 cells, we sought to explore
the possibility that the ability of PRK2 to associate with
TPα/TPβ might occur in a mechanism which is dependent
on the related PRK1, or vice versa. In preliminary
experiments, we found that endogenous expression
of PRK1 may be a pre-requisite for the association of
PRK2 with TPα/TPβ which occurs in PC-3 cells. Hence,
although clarification of our observation requires detailed
investigation, this raises the possibility of the existence
of a potential TPα/TPβ signalling complex in prostate
tumour cells, comprising the receptor and both PRK1 and
PRK2, where PRK1 may function to facilitate binding of
PRK2 to TPα/TPβ and/or PRK1. However, the fact that
PRK1 is constitutively bound to both TPα and TPβ, but
that PRK2 does not bind to TPα but binds to TPβ under
those same conditions, in the absence of agonist, suggests
that PRK1 is not simply serving as a binding platform for
PRK2 binding. Hence, additional studies are necessary
to understand the micro-organisation of TP:PRK proteinprotein complexes generated and, in turn, may facilitate
the design of drugs to block critical protein interactions
in cases where the protein associations leads to disease
[58]. Therefore, given the evidence presented herein for
the critical role of the TPα/TPβ -PRK1/PRK2 signalling
axis in prostate tumorigenesis, it will be of interest to
determine the precise molecular architecture of the
protein complexes which exist between the TPs and
PRK1/PRK2, including identification of the region(s) of
TPα/TPβ which mediate their association with PRK2, and
determining whether PRK1 can directly associate with
PRK2. Furthermore, it will also be crucial to establish if
the TPα/TPβ-PRK1/PRK2 signalling axis plays a role in
tumour progression in other carcinomas where both the
TP and the PRKs are implicated including in breast and
bladder cancer [42, 59].
In conclusion, as outlined in Figure 8B, our study
has uncovered a novel signalling pathway involving
TPα/TPβ and both PRK1 and PRK2, providing a
mechanism for how agonist activation of the TP may
exacerbate prostate cancer, including CRPC. However,
intriguingly while both PRK1 and PRK2 associate with
TPα and TPβ, they do so in a radically different manner
under both basal and agonist-regulated conditions,
including where both TP isoforms show different
associations with PRK2. Bearing in mind the crucial role
for PRK1 and PRK2 in the epigenetic regulation of events
associated with prostate tumour progression/metastasis

media for 0–60 min, or as indicated in the figure legends.
Thereafter, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and
incubated in Radioimmune Precipitation (RIP) buffer
(20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA,
1% (v/v) NP-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1  mM
PMSF, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin; 800 μl/10
cm dish) on ice for 10 min to lyse the cells. Lysates were
homogenised by passing through needles of decreasing
gauge (21–26) and clarified by centrifugation at 13, 000 g for
5 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatant (containing
the soluble lysate) was removed and added to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and an aliquot (typically 50 μl/approx.
50 μg) was retained for analysis of protein expression in
whole cell lysates. The remaining lysate (approx. 750 μl)
was used for immunoprecipitation, using the specified
antibody, typically anti-HA 101R (2 μl) for HEK.TPα,
HEK.TPβ and HEK.β-Gal or affinity purified anti-TPα
(6 μg) and anti-TPβ (6 μg) specific antibodies for PC-3
cells or, as controls, using the equivalent amount of the
pre-immune IgG to pull-down the relevant protein through
overnight incubation at 4°C on a rotator. Thereafter, the
lysates were incubated for 1 hr with Protein G-Sepharose
(50% slurry in RIP buffer; 15 μl) or Protein A-Sepharose
(50% slurry in RIP buffer; 30 μl), prior to washing with at
least four changes of RIP buffer followed by four changes
of PBS. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to
immunoblotting versus either anti-FLAG-HRP, anti-PRK1,
anti-PRK2, anti-PRK3 or anti-HA-HRP antibodies.

Cell culture and transfections
Human embryonic kidney (HEK).TPα, HEK.
TPβ, and HEK.β-Gal cells, stably overexpressing
haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged forms of TPα, TPβ,
and β-galactosidase (β-Gal), respectively, have been
previously described [35] and were grown in minimal
essential medium (MEM), 2 mM L-glutamine and
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Routinely, approx.
48 hr prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density
of 2 × 106  cells/10 cm dish in growth medium (8 ml).
Thereafter, cells were transiently transfected with
400  ng of pADVA and 1.6 μg of pCMV-based vectors
using Effectene and routinely harvested 48–72 hr posttransfection. The prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) and were cultured in RPMI 1640, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 10% FBS (complete medium). For
serum-free media conditions, cells were cultured in their
respective growth medium in the complete absence of FBS
(0%) for times specified for the given study. All cells were
grown at 37°C in a humid environment with 5% CO2 and
were confirmed mycoplasma free.

Determination of PRK activation levels
HEK.TPα and HEK.TPβ cells were transfected and
cultured as described above. Alternatively, PC-3 cells were
seeded on 10 cm dishes and cultured at 37°C, typically for
72 hr or until 85% confluent. In all cases, some 16 hr prior
to beginning experiments, the culture media was removed
and cells were washed with serum-free media followed
by incubation in serum-free media (16 hr). Cells were
then washed twice in ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping
and suspended in PBS supplemented with protease
inhibitors (10 mM Sodium Fluoride, 1 mM Sodium
orthovanadate, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin,
0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM Benzamidine-HCl). Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay
and cells were divided into aliquots (100 μg/aliquot).
Aliquots were then centrifuged at 2, 000 g for 2 min at
4°C and re-suspended in HBSS-HB (Hank’s Balanced
Salt Solution; supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1%
(w/v) BSA and protease inhibitors). Cell suspensions were
then equilibrated for 30 min at 37°C prior to incubation
with either vehicle (0.00005–0.01% EtOH) or U46619
(1 μM, or in concentration-response studies at 0–1 μM) for
0–60 min. Alternatively, where the effects of kinase
inhibition or TP antagonism were investigated, equilibrated
cell suspensions were first incubated with either 10 μM
LY294002, 0.1 μM GSK2334470, 10 μM H-89, 1 μM

Immunoprecipitations
HEK.TPα, HEK.TPβ and HEK.β-Gal cells were
transfected and cultured as described above. Alternatively,
for immunoprecipitation of endogenous TP/PRK
complexes, PC-3 cells were seeded on 10 cm dishes and
cultured at 37°C, typically for 72 hr or until 85% confluent.
In all cases, prior to immunoprecipitation, cells were
washed in serum-free media and either incubated with
vehicle (0.01% EtOH) or U46619 (1 μM) in serum free

respective drug vehicle (0.01% DMSO or 0.01% EtOH)
for 30 min prior to incubation with U46619. Following
stimulations, cells were harvested by centrifugation
(4000 g, 2 min, 4°C) and re-suspended in ice-cold PBS
(50 μl) supplemented with protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE
sample buffer (2X; 50 μl) was added. Samples were then
homogenised, denatured by boiling (1 min) followed by
centrifugation at 13, 000 g (1 min) and incubation at 37°C
for 15 min. Finally, samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE
gels and immunoblotted versus anti-phospho-PRK1Thr774/
PRK2Thr816 or anti-HDJ2, followed by chemiluminescence
detection.

at 1 × 106 cells/10 cm dish in complete culture
medium (8 ml) and grown at 37°C for 48 hr, such
that the cells reached approximately 85% confluency.
Cells were stimulated with U46619 (50 nM, or in
concentration-response studies, 0–1 μM; 0–240 min or
24 hr) or, as controls, with colcemid (50 ng/ml; 24 hr)
or drug vehicle (0.0005% EtOH; 0–240 min or 24 hr).
The cells were then harvested by sequential extraction
to remove soluble cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic
proteins to obtain nuclear extracts (containing histones)
as described previously [61]. In brief, cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS and incubated in hypotonic buffer
(10  mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 and 1 mM KCL, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 50 μM leupeptin and 1 mM DTT;
1 ml) for 30 min at 4°C with rotation to lyse the cells.
The lysate and nuclei were separated by centrifugation
(10, 000 g) and the nuclei were re-suspended in H2SO4
(0.4 N; 400 μl) and incubated overnight at 4°C with
rotation. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation
(16, 000 g) and the histone-containing supernatant
was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube. Histones
were then precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid
(100% w/v; 132 μl) drop-wise to the histone solution.
Pellets were then washed twice with ice-cold acetone
(500 μl) to remove the acid, air-dried and re-suspended
in double-distilled H2O (100 μl). Thereafter, histone
concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay.
For immunoblot analysis, nuclear extracts (2.5 μg) were
resolved on 15% SDS-page gels and transferred onto
PVDF membranes. Thereafter, membranes were screened
using anti-Phospho-H3Thr11 antibody or anti-Histone
H3 to confirm uniform loading.

Disruption of PRK1/2/3 expression by small
interfering (si)RNA
For siRNA experiments, PC-3 cells were routinely
plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35 mm well in complete
medium (2 ml). Thereafter, PC-3 cells were transiently
transfected with 30 nM siRNA specifically targeting
either PRK1, PRK2, or PRK3 and, as a control, with a
nonsense scrambled control siRNA oligonucleotide
(5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′),
using
Dharmafect 2 transfection reagent (4 μl per 35 mm
well). For experiments involving siRNA-mediated
disruption of PRK1, 2 and 3, all data was validated
using at least two independent siRNAs where the
following specific siRNA sequences were used:
PRK1–1 (5′-CCUCGAAGAUUUCAAGUUC-3′), PRK1–
2 (5′-GCACUGUGCUUAAGCUGGA-3′), PRK2–1
(5′-GCACCCAUUUUUCCGGCUA-3′),
PRK2–2
(5′-GCACCCAUUUUUCCGGCUA-3′),
PRK3–1
(5′-GGAAAUACUACGCCAUCAA-3′) or PRK3–2
(5′-AGACCUUUGUCAUCCCACU-3′). Cells were
routinely harvested at 3, 4 or 6 day post-transfection,
and knockdown of PRK1, PRK2 or PRK3 expression
was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-PRK1,
anti-PRK2, or anti-PRK3 specific antibodies, respectively.
Membranes were also screened using anti-HDJ2 antibody
to confirm uniform protein loading. For proliferation
assays, cells were harvested 48 hr post-transfection
and re-seeded onto 96 well plates in complete growth
medium (2000 cells/well; 150 μl) as described below.
For colony formation assays, cells were harvested
some 48 hr post-transfection and re-seeded into soft
agar (2 × 104 cells/35 mm well), as outlined below. For
transwell migration assays, some 48 hr post-transfection,
cells were routinely placed in serum-free media for 24 hr
before experiments were performed, as described below.

Transwell migration assays
PC-3 cells were seeded on 10 cm dishes in complete
culture medium (8 ml) and allowed to grow at 37°C
until the cells reached approximately 80% confluency.
Thereafter, the media was replaced with serum-free
medium for at least 16 hr before performing transwell
assays, using Boyden Chambers (Falcon #353097, 8.0 μM
pore size, 24-well plate format). Boyden Chambers were
coated overnight with fibronectin (5 μg/ml), prior to
beginning assays. For migration assays, 1 × 105 cells,
in serum-free culture media (500 μl), were placed in the
top chamber. After the cells settled (approx. 30 min),
culture medium (500 μl; 10% FBS) was added to the
bottom chamber and cells were incubated with U46619
(10 nM or, in concentration response studies, 5–250 nM)
or vehicle (0.0001% EtOH) in duplicate wells. Following
incubation for 8 hr, the cells remaining in the top chamber
were removed by cotton swabs, and the migrated cells
were fixed in PFA (3.7%), stained with crystal violet
dye (0.25%), washed in H2O and allowed to air-dry.
The cells were then viewed and photographed using a
light microscope at 20 X magnification. For analysis, the

Colony formation assays
PC-3 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/35 mm
well in 2 ml of 0.35% agar prepared in RPMI with 2x
supplements (20% FBS; 4 mM L-glutamine). The 0.35%
soft agar layer was anchored with 2 ml of 0.5% agar
previously prepared in RPMI with 2x supplements.
Thereafter, the cells were allowed to settle in the soft
agar layer for approx. 1 hr before adding a further
2  ml of complete culture medium (RPMI, 10% FBS,
2 mM L-Glut) to the wells. Cells were treated with
U46619 (10 nM or, in concentration response studies,
5–250  nM) or vehicle (0.0001% EtOH). Media and
treatments were refreshed every 72 hr for the duration
of the experiment. Some 10 days post-seeding, cells
were fixed in paraformaldehyde (3.7%), stained with
crystal violet dye (0.05%), washed in H2O and allowed
to air-dry. The number of colonies formed in triplicate
wells was analysed, where colonies were manually
counted using a light microscope (20X magnification)
from 10 independent fields of view.
