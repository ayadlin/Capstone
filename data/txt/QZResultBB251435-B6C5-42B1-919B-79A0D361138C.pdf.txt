Abstract
Inactivation of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway occurs in
diverse human tumors among the general population and
renders those tumors hypersensitive to DNA interstrand-crosslinking (ICL) agents. The identification of novel agents to
which FA pathway–deficient cells were hypersensitive could
provide new therapeutic opportunities and improve our
molecular understanding of the FA genes. Using highthroughput screening, we assessed the growth of isogenic
human cancer cells that differed only in the presence or
absence of single FA genes upon treatment with 880 active
drugs and 40,000 diverse compounds. We identified several
compounds to which FA pathway–deficient cells were more
sensitive than FA pathway–proficient cells, including two
groups of structurally related compounds. We further investigated the compound eliciting the strongest effect, termed
80136342. Its mechanism of action was distinct from that of
ICL agents; 80136342 did not cause increased chromosomal
aberrations, enhanced FANCD2 monoubiquitination, H2AX
phosphorylation, p53 activation, or ICL induction. Similar to
ICL agents, however, 80136342 caused a pronounced G2 arrest
in FA pathway–deficient cells. When applied in combination
with ICL agents, 80136342 had at least additive toxic effects,
excluding interferences on ICL-induced toxicity and facilitating a combinational application. Finally, we identified one
particular methyl group necessary for the effects of 80136342
on FA–deficient cells. In conclusion, using high-throughput
screening in an isogenic human FA cancer model, we explored
a novel approach to identify agents eliciting hypersensitivity
in FA pathway–deficient cells. We discovered several attractive
candidates to serve as lead compounds for evaluating
structure-activity relationships and developing therapeutics
selectively targeting FA pathway–deficient tumors. [Cancer Res

Introduction
There are at least 12 Fanconi anemia (FA) genes, biallelic
mutations of which cause the rare cancer-susceptibility syndrome
FA. These FA genes act in a common pathway involved in DNA
repair, particularly the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL)

and double-strand breaks (DSB; refs. 1, 2). Inactivation of the FA
pathway by either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms also occurs in
subgroups of diverse human cancers among the general population
(3). In pancreatic cancer, inactivating mutations are identified in
BRCA2/FANCD1, FANCC, and FANCG (4–8). Tumor cells having FA
pathway inactivation are hypersensitive to ICL agents in vitro and
in vivo (5, 9). The extent of hypersensitivity depends on the specific
ICL agent and seems to reflect the proportional contribution of
ICLs to the overall toxicity of the drug (10). FA pathway–deficient
cells are also hypersensitive to some inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (11–15). Evidence differs as to whether these cells
exhibit increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (10, 16). The
identification of novel agents to which FA pathway–deficient cells
were hypersensitive could contribute to a better understanding of
the biochemical mechanisms that underlie the FA–related chemical
hypersensitivity phenotype and could also provide additional
therapeutic opportunities. The discovery of agents that confer
increased sensitivity via a different mechanism of action than the
known ICL agents might also be useful for the development of
combination therapies that produce synergistic effects (17).
Using somatic cell gene targeting in the human cancer cell line
RKO, we recently engineered several clones that genetically differed
only in the presence or absence of single FA genes (FANCC or
FANCG). We investigated the effect of these gene defects on
chromosomal instability and drug and irradiation sensitivity (10).
We report here the application of this model to high-throughput
screening (HTS), using four different clones against a panel of 880
active drugs and 40,000 diverse compounds. This model was ideally
suited for HTS due to the availability of appropriate control cells
(18) and the ability to simultaneously screen multiple clones,
facilitating the rapid identification of compounds that specifically
affected the growth of cells harboring FA gene defects.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, drug, and compound libraries. Parental RKO cells, clones
harboring an engineered disruption of FANCC or FANCG, and clones stably
transfected with a p53-reporter construct, are described (10, 19, 20). The
compound stocks, comprising 880 known active drugs (Prestwick library,
Prestwick, Washington, DC) and 40,000 diverse compounds (ChemDiv, San
Diego, CA), were maintained in 100% DMSO at 20jC.
Primary (high-throughput) screening and libraries. To validate our
HTS approach, the assay was designed to yield a z factor of >0.5 (21). All
screening steps were done using a Biomek FX Laboratory Automation
Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), as previously described (22).
Briefly, we used each compound at a final concentration of 2.5 Ag/mL in
0.5% DMSO. Two FA pathway–proficient and two FA pathway–deficient
lines were employed (parental and FANCG+/ cells versus FANCG / and
FANCC / / cells). The appropriate number of cells to yield f80%
confluence after 5 days was determined individually and was similar for all
clones (300–350 per well). Cells were plated in 20 AL of complete medium in

384-well tissue culture plates and allowed to settle overnight. Twenty-four
hours after seeding, compounds were serially diluted with complete medium
to 5 Ag/mL; 20 AL of this dilution was added to each well containing 20 AL
of medium and cells to yield the final screening concentration. In each
384-well plate, 80 compounds and 16 DMSO (no drug) controls were tested
against each of the four cell clones. After 4 days, 40 AL of lysis/detection
solution containing 1.2% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
and SYBR Green I (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added.
Subsequently, fluorescence was measured per well. The data were exported
to a custom program that determined growth inhibition by dividing
each treated value by the average of the 16 control values. Compounds
were scored as ‘‘hits,’’ when they preferentially inhibited the growth of both
FA pathway–deficient lines (FANCG / and FANCC / / ) compared with
both FA pathway–proficient lines (parental cells and FANCG +/ ). For
compounds to be considered for follow-up secondary screening, the
average of growth inhibition of the FA pathway–deficient lines divided by
the average of growth inhibition of the control lines had to be <0.7 (growth
inhibition ratio), and the growth inhibition differences between FA pathway–
deficient lines or between FA pathway–proficient lines, respectively, had
to be <0.3.
Secondary screening. Compounds found to specifically inhibit the
growth of the FA pathway–deficient clones were repeated for confirmation,
using standard cell proliferation assays over a broad range of concentrations (covering 100% to 0% survival). Cells (1,500–1,800 per well) were
plated in 96-well plates, allowed to adhere, and subsequently treated. After
6 days, the cells were washed and lysed in 100 AL H2O, and 0.5% Picogreen
(Molecular Probes) was added. Fluorescence was measured, and growth
inhibition was calculated compared with the untreated samples. At least
four independent experiments were done per compound, with each data
point reflecting triplicate wells.
Clonogenic survival assays. RKO cells and isogenic derivatives were
seeded into six-well plates at multiple concentrations, allowed to attach
overnight, and treated in duplicate with 80136342. After continuous
exposure for 13 days, the cells were washed and stained with crystal violet.
All visible colonies were counted.
Chromosome breakage analysis. FANCC / / cells were treated with
80136342 at 2.5 Amol/L (representing 80% cell survival) or 10 Amol/L
(representing 20% cell survival) for 24 to 72 h. After treatment with
colcemid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 0.01 Ag/mL for 4 h, the cells were
harvested, and chromosome breakage analysis was done by our cytogenetics core facility. Fifty metaphases were assessed per sample for breakage
and other structural abnormalities (i.e., rings or radials).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were treated with 80136342 at multiple doses
for 48 h, subsequently washed, fixed in PBS/3.7% formaldehyde/0.5% NP40
(U.S. Biochemical, Cleveland, OH), stained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst
33258, Sigma), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Ten thousand events were
acquired per sample. The data were processed using Cell Quest software
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
DNA ICL assays. The compounds were diluted in DMSO to a final
concentration of 20 mmol/L. Plasmid DNA (pSP73, 2,464 bp) was linearized
with EcoRI, purified, and 3¶ end-labeled with a-[32P]ATP using Klenow DNA
polymerase. Labeled plasmid (100 ng) was incubated in the presence of
0.01 mol/L NaClO4 with the compounds at various concentrations for
24 h at 37jC and subsequently separated using 1% agarose gels. Cisplatin at
3.4 Amol/L served as positive control. As potential ICLs could be labile
either at high temperatures or under alkaline conditions, DNA denaturation
was done both by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions or by
heating the samples to 90jC for 5 min before neutral gel electrophoresis.
The same experiments were done using conditions in which the tested
compounds were incubated with DNA either in 10 mmol/L phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5) or in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Because mitomycin C (MMC)
requires reductive activation to cause the formation of ICLs in isolated
DNA, additional experiments were done as previously described (23).
Briefly, labeled plasmid was incubated under anaerobic conditions with the
test compounds at various concentrations, using Na2S2O4 in 10 mol/L
excess as a reducing agent. MMC at 10 to 100 Amol/L was used as a positive
control.

H2AX phosphorylation assays. Cells at f70% confluency were
continuously exposed to 80136342 at 10 Amol/L for 24 h. Ionizing radiation
at 10 Gy served as a positive control. Treated cells were subsequently fixed
in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and fixed in 20jC methanol.
Following permeabilization in TBS/0.5% Triton X-100 and blocking in TBS/
2% bovine serum albumin/0.5% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with
a primary monoclonal mouse anti-human g-H2AX antibody (1:200; Upstate,
Waltham, MA) for 2 h. The cells were washed and incubated with an Alexa
488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1.5 h.
After washing, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at 10
Ag/mL. Slides were then mounted and analyzed. Exposure time and
software settings (Metamorph 4.6, Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA)
were kept constant for all samples within each experiment.
Mitotic index assays. FANCC / / cells were continuously exposed to
80136342 at 20 and 40 Amol/L for 48 h or left untreated. Subsequently, all
cells, including dislodged cells, were harvested, fixed in PBS/3.7%
formaldehyde/0.5% NP40, and stained with bisbenzimide. The mitotic
index was determined as described (24), analyzing at least 200 cells per
sample.
p53 reporter assays. The p53 reporter cell line has been described
(19, 20). Cells at f70% confluence were continuously exposed to 80136342
at 10 and 20 Amol/L for 24 h. Etoposide at 50 Amol/L served as positive
control. Subsequently, luciferase substrate (Steady-Glo, Promega, Madison,
WI) was added, and light emission was measured. Relative light emission
was calculated compared with the untreated samples.
Western blotting. Protein lysates from 200,000 cells, treated for 24 h,
were separated on 3% to 8% Tris-acetate gels for 165 min at 150 V and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking, the
membranes were incubated overnight with a monoclonal mouse antihuman FANCD2 antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA). Membranes were washed and probed with a secondary goat antimouse antibody (1:10,000; Pierce, Rockford, IL). Detection was done using
SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Pierce).

Results
Primary Screening
Two FA pathway–proficient (parental RKO and FANCG +/ ) and
two FA pathway–deficient (FANCG / and FANCC / / ) cell lines
having similar growth rates were employed to limit clonal
variability often associated with HTS and to enhance the specificity
of the primary screen. The clones did not systematically differ in
growth inhibition when tested with the majority of compounds,
ruling out a general hypersensitivity phenotype of the FA pathway–
deficient cells. Screening of 880 active drugs from the Prestwick
library yielded one hit, carmustine (growth inhibition ratio = 0.29),
a known ICL agent. Screening of 40,000 diverse compounds
generated 90 primary hits (0.2%) according to the criteria described
in Materials and Methods.

Secondary Screening
The 90 compounds found to specifically inhibit the growth of the
FA pathway–deficient clones were repeated for confirmation using
standard cell proliferation assays. Compounds were tested over a
broad range of concentrations, covering 100% to 0% cell survival.
Twenty-one of the 90 compounds (23%) were confirmed in multiple
experiments. Except for one compound (termed 80136342), FA
pathway–deficient cells were modestly hypersensitive (IC50 ratios
V2.5) to the identified compounds over a narrow concentration
range. Of note, we discovered two groups (termed C499xxxx and
3527xxxx) of structurally related compounds that elicited similar
hypersensitivities (Fig. 1). Compared with these compound
families, 80136342 conferred a stronger hypersensitivity over a
wider concentration range (Fig. 2A). This effect was more

pronounced in FANCC-deficient cells than in FANCG-deficient cells
(Fig. 2B), as confirmed by employing several independently derived
clones (parental RKO cells, one FANCC +/ / , one FANCG +/ , two
FANCC / / , and two FANCG / clones; Fig. 2C). Interestingly, a
similar compound from the applied compound library, termed
80136341 and differing from 80136342 only in the absence of one

particular methyl group (Fig. 2A, arrow), did not confer hypersensitivity in our model (data not shown).

similar to that observed in the short-term assays. However, the
growth differences were observed at lower concentrations (Fig. 2B).
Similar to the short-term proliferation assays, FANCC-deficient
cells were more strongly affected than were FANCG-deficient
clones.

Comparisons of Mechanism of Action between
80136342 and ICL Agents
Due to its pronounced effects, we further focused our interest on
80136342. To investigate whether this compound elicited increased
sensitivity in FA pathway–deficient cells via a similar mechanism as
do ICL agents or irradiation, we assessed chromosome breakage,
H2AX phosphorylation, p53 activation, ICL formation, cell cycle
effects, and FANCD2 monoubiquitination.
Chromosome breakage testing. FA pathway–deficient cells
experience increased chromosomal aberrations upon treatment
with ICL agents, a phenotype so stringently observed in
nonmalignant FA cells that diepoxybutane testing serves as a
diagnostic assay (25–27). Using our model, we previously reported
drastically increased aberrations in FANCG / and FANCC / /
cells, including the formation of rings and radials, 48 h after
treatment with ICL agents compared with parental and heterozygote control cells (10). In contrast, we did not observe increased
chromosomal aberrations in parental or FANCC / / cells 24 or 48
h after treatment with 80136342 at 2.5 or 10 Amol/L, corresponding
to 80% and 20% cell survival (V3 breaks per 50 cells in every
sample), respectively. Seventy-two hours after treatment, chromosomal breaks were slightly increased but did not differ significantly
between parental cells (0 break in 44 cells, 1 break in 5 cells, and
2 breaks in 1 cell) and FANCC / / cells (0 break in 42 cells,
1 break in 6 cells, and 2 breaks in 2 cells). The characteristic
formation of rings or radials, observed upon treatment with ICL
agents, was not seen at any concentration of 80136342 at any time
point.
H2AX phosporylation and p53-reporter assays. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX along with activation of p53 can serve as a
surrogate marker for the induction of DSBs (19). 80136342 at
10 Amol/L did not induce phosphorylation of H2AX in parental,
FANCG / , or FANCC / / cells, whereas irradiated control cells
had a pronounced H2AX phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Likewise,
80136342 at 10 or 20 Amol/L did not activate p53 in RKO cells
stably transfected with a p53-reporter construct, whereas etoposide-treated control cells activated p53 (Fig. 3B). Thus, there was
no evidence for the induction of DSBs by 80136342.
DNA ICL assays. In contrast to cisplatin and MMC, neither
80136342 nor compounds in the families C499xxx and 3527xxxx
induced ICLs in vitro. To ensure the detection of potential labile
ICLs, these compounds were tested under various conditions
(alkaline/neutral/reducing conditions during treatment, alkaline/
heat denaturation, and alkaline/neutral gel electrophoresis: Fig. 3C;
data not shown).
Cell cycle analyses. 80136342 at 10, 20, and 40 Amol/L induced
an incremental G1 arrest in both FA pathway–proficient and FA
pathway–deficient cells, as determined by increasing G1-S-ratios.
FA pathway–deficient cells had a more accentuated G2 arrest at
low concentrations of 80136342 than FA pathway–proficient cells.
Consistent with the cell survival data, the G2 arrest was more
pronounced in the FANCC / / cells (i.e., more cells in G2, observable at concentrations z10 Amol/L) than in the FANCG / cells
(i.e., fewer cells in G2, observable at concentrations z20 Amol/L).
At high concentrations, a late S and G2 arrest was universally

www.aacrjournals.org

observed in all cells independent of genotype (Fig. 4A and B).
We next did mitotic index assays using FANCC / / cells to
distinguish between cells in G2 and cells in mitotic arrest or cells
undergoing mitotic catastrophe. In contrast to the increased
fraction of FANCC / / cells in G2-M observed with cell cycle
analysis, there was a decrease in mitotic cells upon treatment with
80136342 (2.6% mitotic cells without treatment, 0.4% mitotic cells
after treatment with 80136342 at 20 Amol/L, and 0.0% mitotic cells
after treatment with 80136342 at 40 Amol/L). Therefore, the
increased G2-M population was caused neither by cells in mitotic
arrest nor by cells headed for mitotic catastrophe; it thus
represents a pre-M phase arrest.
FANCD2 monoubiquitination. FANCD2 monoubiquitination is
defective in FA pathway–deficient cells and was therefore assessed
in parental and FANCG+/ cells. 80136342 at 40 Amol/L abrogated
FANCD2 monoubiquitination. At 80 Amol/L, some monoubiquitinated FANCD2 was detected (Fig. 4B). These data were consistent
with our cell cycle analyses, as FANCD2 monoubiquitination is
known to be associated with normal S phase progression (28).
Thus, whereas treatment with ICL agents enhances FANCD2
monoubiquitination in parental and FANCG +/ cells (ref. 10;
despite a G2 arrest), treatment with 80136342 did not.

Combination of 80136342 with Known ICL Agents
We tested the combinatorial effects of 80136342 and known ICL
agents on cell growth (Fig. 5) by treating the cells simultaneously
with both 80136342 and MMC. 80136342 was added either at a
fixed concentration to varying MMC concentrations, or the
concentration ratio was kept constant for 80136342 and MMC. In
the first scenario, a number of fixed concentrations of 80136342
increased the toxicity of MMC. Similar effects were observed when
combining the two ICL agents MMC and melphalan in this manner
(Fig. 5A; data not shown). In the second scenario, adding 80136342
at a fixed ratio to MMC, we observed a shift of the pharmacogenomic window towards lower concentrations of MMC. Again,
similar effects were observed when combining MMC and
melphalan in this manner (Fig. 5B). The fixed ratios of MMC and
80136342 or MMC and melphalan, respectively, were chosen from
the ratio of the lowest dose of each agent that killed all cells
independent of genotype.

Discussion
FA pathway–deficient cells display a robust hypersensitivity
towards certain agents, rendering FA gene defects as promising
targets for an individualized, genotype-specific anticancer therapy.
We applied our recently developed human cancer cell model of FA
gene defects to HTS, using a panel of 880 active drugs and 40,000
diverse compounds, in an effort to identify novel agents to which
FA pathway–deficient cells would be hypersensitive.
When treated with 880 active drugs from the Prestwick library,
the FA pathway–deficient cells displayed a highly restricted hypersensitivity towards ICL agents, as expected. We only identified one
hit, the ICL agent carmustine. The growth-inhibitory effects of this
drug on FANCC- and FANCG-deficient cancer cells have been
previously characterized in our model (IC50 ratio = 3.5; ref. 10).
When treated with 40,000 compounds, the FA pathway–deficient
clones did not systematically differ from the FA pathway–proficient
clones (hit rate = 0.2%), ruling out a phenotype of general chemical
hypersensitivity. Thus, cancer cells harboring an engineered disruption of the proximal FA genes FANCC or FANCG seem not to

express a considerable reduction of fitness associated with an
increased drug sensitivity as do some BRCA2-deficient cancer
cells (17).4
We identified two structurally related compound families to
which FA pathway–deficient cells were more sensitive than control
cells (IC50 ratios V 2.5). The identical structural parts of these
compounds suggested the presence of a pharmacophore. Future
studies investigating the structure-activity relationships (SAR) will
be a critical step in defining the underlying mechanism for the
increased sensitivity of FA pathway–deficient cells to these
compounds. We also identified a compound, termed 80136342, to
which FA pathway–deficient cells were more sensitive than control
cells over a wider concentration range, and which conveyed greater

toxicity on FANCC-deficient than on FANCG-deficient cells. Initial
SAR studies suggested that the increased sensitivity of FA pathway–
deficient cells to 80136342 was dependent on a particular methyl
group, as no increased sensitivity was observed upon treatment
with a similar compound, differing from the former only by the
absence of this methyl group.
The mechanism of action of 80136342 was distinct from that of
ICL agents or irradiation. In contrast to drastically increased
chromosomal aberrations in FANCG / and FANCC / / cells,
including the formation of rings and radials, upon treatment with
ICL agents (10), we found only a slight increase in chromosomal
breaks, but no rings or radials, upon treatment with 80136342,
aberrations that were observed similarly in FA pathway–proficient
and FA pathway–deficient cells. Likewise, whereas treatment with
ICL agents typically enhances FANCD2 monoubiquitination in FA
pathway–proficient cells (10, 29), treatment with 80136342 did not.
Treatment with 80136342 also did not induce DSBs, as shown by a
lack of H2AX phosphorylation and p53 activation. Finally, we found

Figure 5. Combinational effects of 80136342 and ICL agents. Short-term assays showing relative survival of parental cells, FANCG +/ , FANCG / , and
FANCC / / clones upon treatment with MMC combined with 80136342 or melphalan, respectively, either at a fixed dose (A) or at a fixed concentration ratio (B). Solid

no evidence that 80136342 would form ICLs in our assays. Taken
together, the assessment of chromosomal aberrations, FANCD2
monoubiquitination, H2AX phosphorylation, p53 activation, and
ICL induction upon treatment with 80136342 provided no evidence
of having induced DNA damage. Thus, the increased sensitivity of
FA pathway–deficient cells to 80136342 seemed to be mechanistically distinct from the hypersensitivity to ICL agents or
irradiation and could not be attributed to a cellular impairment
in ICL or DSB repair. On the other hand, 80136342 mimicked the
hypersensitivity phenotype of ICL agents with regard to cell cycle
dysregulation (10, 30–32). FANCC / / cells and, to a lesser extent,
FANCG / cells had a more accentuated G2 (but not M) phase
arrest at low concentrations of 80136342 than FA pathway–
proficient cells, suggesting that the commonly observed G2 cell
cycle abnormalities of FA pathway–deficient cells may not
exclusively reflect the cellular response to DNA damage but might
occur upon non-genotoxic influences as well.
Because our findings suggested a unique growth inhibitory
mechanism of 80136342, we tested whether this compound would
confer additional toxicity when combined with ICL agents. Adding
80136342 either at a fixed concentration or at a fixed ratio to
variable concentrations of MMC confirmed an additional toxicity
in either setting and excluded possible interferences of 80136342 on
ICL agent–induced toxicity. Similar effects were observed when
combining two ICL agents that have strong effects on FA pathway–
deficient cells (MMC and melphalan). These results suggested that

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

the combinational use of novel non-ICL agents with ICL agents
deserves further investigation and indicated a potential application
of such therapies to reduce the known harmful side effects of ICL
agents when used alone.
Finally, we investigated whether the observed hypersensitivity of
FA pathway–deficient cells could be generalized to a human cancer
FA model in which defective FA gene function was complemented
by exogenous overexpression of the respective gene. We therefore
compared the pancreatic cancer cell lines HS766T and PL11, which
harbor deleterious mutations in FANCG and FANCC, respectively,
with their complemented counterparts overexpressing the respective gene (4, 5). Preliminary experiments showed that the FA–
defective cell lines appeared only slightly yet not significantly more
sensitive towards treatment with 80136342 than the complemented
cells (IC50 ratios V 1.5). Using ICL agents, we reported observing a
pharmacogenomic window considerably larger in the knockout
model than in the overexpression model (e.g., 14-fold versus 5- to
6-fold for melphalan and 12- to 13-fold versus 8- to 10-fold for
MMC; refs. 10, 33). These differences between the two models are
likely due to the newer model having avoided the artifacts such as
off-target effects and squelching produced by gene overexpression
in the older model, illustrating that the compounds identified here
using the knockout system could not readily have been found using
a less stringent model.
In conclusion, using HTS in a well-controlled isogenic human FA
cancer model, we showed a novel approach to identify agents to

HTS and Hypersensitivity in Fanconi Anemia Cells

which FA pathway–deficient cells are hypersensitive. We discovered two groups of compounds eliciting hypersensitivity in a
structure-specific manner and a single compound eliciting
hypersensitivity via a yet unknown mechanism distinct from that
of ICL agents or irradiation. These compounds represent attractive
candidates to serve as lead compounds for further development,
eventually aiming at an individualized, genotype-based therapy of
FA pathway–deficient tumors (17).
