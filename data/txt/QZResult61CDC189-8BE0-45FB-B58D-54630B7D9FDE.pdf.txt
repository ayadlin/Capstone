BACKGROUND. Few studies have examined the costs of supportive care for radiochemotherapy-induced mucosits/pharyngitis among patients with head and neck
cancer (HNC) or lung cancers despite the documented negative clinical impact
of these complications.

Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center
and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.

METHODS. The authors identified a retrospective cohort of patients with HNC or
nonsmall lung cancer (NSCLC) who had received radiochemotherapy at 1 of 3
Chicago hospitals (a Veterans Administration hospital, a county hospital, or a tertiary care hospital). Charts were reviewed for the presence/absence of severe
mucositis/pharyngitis and the medical resources that were used. Resource estimates were converted into cost units obtained from standard sources (hospital
bills, Medicare physician fee schedule, Red Book). Estimates of resources used
and direct medical costs were compared for patients who did and patients who
did not develop severe mucositis/pharyngitis.
RESULTS. Severe mucositis/pharyngitis occurred in 70.1% of 99 patients with

2

HNC and in 37.5% of 40 patients with NSCLC during radiochemotherapy. The

total median medical costs per patient were $39,313 for patients with mucositis/
pharyngitis and $20,798 for patients without mucositis/pharyngitis (P 5 .007).
Extended inpatient hospitalization accounted for $12,600 of the increased medical costs (median 14 days [$19,600] with severe mucositis/pharyngitis vs 5 days
[$7000] without; P 5 .017). For patients who had HNC with mucositis/pharyngitis, incremental inpatient hospitalization costs were $14,000, and total medical
costs were $17,244. For patients who had NSCLC with mucositis/pharyngitis,

Costs of Severe Mucositis/Nonzee et al

M

ucositis and pharyngitis are common treatment-limiting side effects noted among patients
with head and neck cancer (HNC) and lung cancer.1
Ninety percent of patients with HNC develop
mucositis/pharyngitis after radiochemotherapy, and
approximately two-thirds of those patients experience severe and debilitating toxicities.1 Although the
rates of mucositis/pharyngitis are lower among
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
than patients with HNC who receive radiochemotherapy, it still may interfere with therapy, permit
local or systemic infection, and reduce quality of
life.1 Although the negative effects of this toxicity on
clinical and quality-of-life variables in HNC have
been well documented, only 1 prior study has
reported on the economic impact of treating radiochemotherapy-associated toxicity in patients with
HNC.2 To our knowledge, no studies have assessed
the economic impact of treating this complication in
patients with NSCLC. Herein, we report on the types
of resources used and the incremental medical costs
of treatment for radiochemotherapy-associated,
severe mucositis/pharyngitis among a cohort of
patients with HNC or NSCLC who received cancer
treatment at a Veterans Administration (VA) hospital,
a county hospital, or a tertiary care comprehensive
cancer center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Medical records for patients with HNC or NSCLC
who received care between 2003 and 2005 at 1 of 3
large referral hospitals in Chicago were reviewed for
this study. One of the hospitals was an academic
comprehensive cancer center (Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University), 1 was a county hospital (John H. Stroger Jr.
Hospital of Cook County), and 1 was a VA Medical
Center (Jesse Brown VA Medical Center-Lakeside Division). Charts were included if patients were aged
18 years, had a pathologic diagnosis of stage I
through IV HNC or stage I through IV NSCLC, and
had completed radiochemotherapy regimens.
Information abstracted from medical charts
included baseline clinical and demographic characteristics,
comorbidities,
medications,
medical
devices, laboratory tests, inpatient hospitalizations,
and clinic visits. For operational purposes, mucositis/pharyngitis was defined as toxicity that resulted
in documentation in physician chart notes. Grade
of toxicity often was not reported. The abstraction
period for each patient began on the date radiochemotherapy was initiated and ended 2 months after
radiochemotherapy was completed. Two individuals

1447

abstracted the data independently, and a local panel
of 3 lung cancer or HNC oncology specialists provided input on clinical considerations, such as
mucositis/pharyngitis-related medications.
For the economic analysis, we assigned a value to
each medical resource, as described in detail previously.3 In brief, unit costs for each resource were
obtained from standard sources, such as hospital bills
for inpatient stays, the Medicare physician fee schedule for outpatient services, and the Red Book for pharmaceuticals.4 The Red Book is a nationally recognized
reference that contains average wholesale prices, direct
prices, and federal upper limit prices for prescription
pharmaceuticals. Standard unit costs were multiplied
by each individual utilization number of services to
estimate per patient costs for individual resources. The
individual costs for each patient were then added to
generate a total per patient cost estimate.
Cost estimates for each individual resource and
total per patient costs were compared for patients
with severe mucositis/pharyngitis versus those without severe mucositis/pharyngitis using the MannWhitney 2-tailed test, as described in our prior cost
studies.5,6 Total per patient costs were normalized by
log transformation and were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis to identify the factors
associated with higher total costs.2,7 The analysis was
conducted from the provider’s perspective in 2005
U.S. dollars. For simplicity, we report median values
for cost and resource utilization, although, qualitatively, the findings were similar when evaluated
according to the log-transformed cost estimates.
The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards at the Northwestern University Robert
H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center and at Cook
County Hospital and by the Research and Development Committee at the Jesse Brown VA Medical
Center. Waivers of informed consent and Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
authorization were obtained. The research was conceived and conducted by the study investigators,
who were solely responsible for analysis and interpretation of the data and preparation of this article.

men, and the median age was 59 years (range, 27-85
years). Care was provided at the county medical center for 33%, and at the VA Medical Center for 14%.
Most of the cohort (77.6%) had stage III or stage IV
malignancies. Severe radiochemotherapy-associated
mucositis/pharyngitis developed in 70% of the
patients with HNC and in 38% of the patients with
NSCLC, which represented all of patients who had
mucositis/pharyngitis documented in physician
notes.
The standard radiochemotherapy regimen for
patients with HNC was single-agent cisplatin at a
dose of 100 mg/m2 administered 3 times during the
course of radiation at 21-day intervals.8 The standard radiochemotherapy regimen for patients with
NSCLC was combined cisplatin and etoposide with
concurrent radiation completed to a dose of 61
grays.9
Compared with patients who did not develop
severe mucositis/pharyngitis, the patients with HNC
or NSCLC who developed severe radiochemotherapyassociated oral mucositis/pharyngitis required more
medical resources and incurred higher costs during
the treatment phase (Table 2). The total median cost
per patient was $39,313 for those with mucositis/
pharyngitis and $20,798 for those without, resulting
in a median incremental cost of $18,515 per patient
(Table 2) (P 5 .007). A higher median cost for inpatient hospitalization was evident both for patients with
HNC and for patients with NSCLC, although the difference was significant only for patients with HNC
(Table 2).
The primary driver of the total cost appeared to
be inpatient hospitalization, primarily to support
alimentation, which was 2.8 times higher in the
patients who developed severe oral mucositis/pharyngitis (median, $19,000 vs $7000; P 5 .017) (Table
2). A higher median cost was noted both for patients
with HNC and for patients with NSCLC, but the difference was significant only for patients with HNC
(Table 2). The greater inpatient hospitalization cost
may be attributed to a longer duration of inpatient
hospitalization for patients who developed severe
oral mucositis/pharyngitis: The median duration of
inpatient hospitalization was 14 days (range, 2.5-29
days) for patients who developed severe oral mucositis/pharyngitis and 5 days (range, 0-16.5 days) for
patients who did not. The longer duration of hospitalization was noted both for patients with HNC
(median, 15 days with severe mucositis vs 5 days
without) and for patients with NSCLC (median, 13
days with severe mucositis vs 5 days without).
Supportive care pharmaceuticals accounted for a
small amount of the total medical expenditures but

1449

were significantly more expensive in patients with
versus patients without severe mucositis/pharyngitis
(median, $195 vs $84, respectively; P 5 .008) (Table
2). The cost of procedures, including esophagogastroduodenostomy or G-tube placement/reinsertion,
also was significantly greater among patients with
mucositis/pharyngitis (Table 2). There was a trend
toward a higher number of outpatient visits to the
cancer clinic after hospital discharge (P 5 .08) for
patients who developed severe mucositis/pharyngitis.
The median number of clinic visits was 25 (range,
17-35 visits) versus 18 (range, 1-33 visits) for patients
with and without severe mucositis/pharyngitis,
respectively.
Multivariate regression models indicated that
patient sociodemographic characteristics, tumor site
(HNC vs NSCLC), and presence versus absence of
severe mucositis/pharyngitis were significant predictors of cost. After adjusting for patient sociodemographic characteristics, type of cancer, and site of
care, the development of mucositis/pharyngitis remained a significant predictor of total medical costs
(Table 2).

DISCUSSION
From this medical chart review study, we obtained
detailed resource utilization information from a
cohort of patients with HNC and NSCLC during a
time when 70% and 38%, respectively, developed
radiochemotherapy-associated mucositis/pharyngitis.
For the patients who developed severe oral mucositis/pharyngitis, the median incremental cost of the
toxicity was $17,244 for patients with HNC and
$25,060 for patients with NSCLC. Most of this
increase in cost was associated with inpatient hospitalization required for supportive care, primarily for
alimentation.
Our estimates of the costs of severe radiochemotherapy-associated mucositis/pharyngitis can be
compared with those reported in a recent study from
the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.2 In that study, the incremental cost associated
with severe mucositis/pharyngitis was up to $6000,
whereas our cost of toxicity estimate was almost 3fold higher. This difference may be explained by the
longer duration of hospitalization in our study. The
incremental duration of hospitalization among cancer patients who developed treatment-related mucositis/pharyngitis in our study was 14 days versus only
1 day in the prior study. Elting et al noted that
patients at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center received care at a time when the hospital was operating at maximum capacity and there

were strong disincentives for providing supportive
care in the inpatient setting.
The results of the current study can be contrasted with those reported previously by our group
for other cancer-treatment–related toxicities (Table
3).10 In particular, our costs of radiochemotherapyassociated mucositis/pharyngitis were similar to
those reported for inpatient care for chemotherapyassociated neutropenia and were markedly greater
than those reported for a wide range of other chemotherapy-associated toxicities, almost all of which
were $10,000 (Table 3). It also is evident from Table
3 that the most expensive toxicities were those that
were treated in an inpatient setting.
This study had several limitations. First, neither
this study nor most of the prior cost of toxicity
studies prospectively evaluated the severity of mucositis/pharyngitis. Second, we did not include assessments of indirect costs, such as time lost from work
for patients and caregivers. Our prior studies indicated that these costs range from $3800 to $4280 per
episode of chemotherapy-associated neurotoxicity,
neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.3 In addition,
although the patterns of care were similar between
the VA Medical Center and the county hospital, we
did not compare differences among the 3 accrual
sites because of sample size limitations. It may be
valuable for future studies to determine cost differ-

ences among institutions and to collect cost data on
larger sample sizes than that of this pilot study.
Finally, because toxicity gradations were not available
consistently in medical records, our study may have
been biased toward patients with severe mucositis/
pharyngitis reported in physician notes. Future studies should include patients with a broader range of
radiochemotherapy-induced
mucositis/pharyngitis
severity.
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the incremental costs of radiochemotherapy-associated oral mucositis/pharyngitis are
substantial and are greater than those previously
reported for a wide range of chemotherapy-associated toxicities. Although recent studies have
demonstrated the clinical benefit of intensive therapy,11 interventions are needed that decrease the frequency and severity of this toxicity among patients
with HNC or NSCLC who receive radiochemotherapy
regimens.
