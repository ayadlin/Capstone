cell death/apoptosis. One of the central prosurvival regulators of
the ESR is glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78/BiP), which has
important roles in protein folding and assembly, in targeting
misfolded protein for degradation, in ER Ca2+ binding, and in
controlling the activation of transmembrane ER stress sensors (3).
On the other hand, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous
transcription factor (CHOP/GADD153) and caspase-4 are critical
executioners of the proapoptotic arm of the ESR (4, 5). In cases of
intense or persistently high stress, the defensive functions (such as
elevated levels of GRP78) are being overwhelmed, and the
proapoptotic components (such as CHOP and caspase-4) will gain
dominance and trigger cell death.
Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) has been approved for the
treatment of multiple myeloma and is being investigated for the
potential therapy of other tumors as well (6, 7). It functions as a
selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, a multisubunit protein
complex that is responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated
proteins, which include damaged and obsolete proteins that need
to be deleted from the inventory of the cell (8). Recent studies have
indicated that induction of cell death by bortezomib is a result of
the accumulation of misfolded and otherwise damaged proteins,
thereby leading to the activation of the unfolded protein response,
which in turn leads to the activation of the ESR (9, 10). It is thought
that, in the continuous presence of this drug, ever increasing levels
of obsolete proteins are overwhelming the protective efforts of the
ESR (e.g., increased levels of the chaperone GRP78) and trigger cell
death via the stimulation of CHOP and other proapoptotic
components of the ESR (11).
Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
and is widely prescribed under the trade name Celebrex for relief of
symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis; it was also
approved as an adjunct to the standard of care for patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis. In the laboratory, celecoxib has
shown potent anticancer activity in various animal tumor models,
and it is suspected that this drug might be useful for the treatment
of colorectal and possibly other types of cancer as well (12–14).
The underlying molecular mechanisms by which celecoxib exerts
its antitumor effects are not entirely understood, in particular due
to an increasing number of reports describing potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of this drug in the absence of any
apparent involvement of COX-2 (15–22). One of several lines of
evidence excluding the potential contribution of COX-2 came from
the use of 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC), a close structural
analogue of celecoxib that lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2
activity (23). Despite its inability to inhibit COX-2, DMC faithfully
and more potently mimics all of the numerous antitumor effects

Abstract
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) is known to
trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via the accumulation of obsolete and damaged proteins. The selective
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex)
causes ER stress through a different mechanism (i.e., by
causing leakage of calcium from the ER into the cytosol). Each
of these two mechanisms has been implicated in the
anticancer effects of the respective drug. We therefore
investigated whether the combination of these two drugs
would lead to further increased ER stress and would enhance
their antitumor efficacy. With the use of human glioblastoma
cell lines, we show that this is indeed the case. When
combined, bortezomib and celecoxib triggered elevated
expression of the ER stress markers GRP78/BiP and CHOP/
GADD153, caused activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and
ER stress-associated caspase-4, and greatly increased apoptotic cell death. Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of
the protective ER chaperone GRP78/BiP further sensitized the
tumor cells to killing by the drug combination. The
contribution of celecoxib was independent of the inhibition
of COX-2 because a non-coxib analogue of this drug,
2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC), faithfully and more potently
mimicked these combination effects in vitro and in vivo. Taken
together, our results show that combining bortezomib with
celecoxib or DMC very potently triggers the ER stress response
and results in greatly increased glioblastoma cytotoxicity. We
propose that this novel drug combination should receive
further evaluation as a potentially effective anticancer
therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(3):843–51]

Introduction
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (ESR) consists
of a set of adaptive pathways that can be triggered by disparate
perturbations of normal ER function, such as accumulation of
unfolded proteins, lipid or glycolipid imbalances, or changes in the
ionic conditions of the ER lumen (see refs. 1, 2 for reviews). The
primary purpose of the ESR is to alleviate the stressful disturbance
and restore proper ER homeostasis; however, in the case of intense
or persistent ER stress, these pathways will trigger programmed

in vitro and in vivo of celecoxib, including the reduction of
neovascularization and the inhibition of experimental tumor
growth in various animal tumor models (18, 24, 31).
Recent reports have established the ESR as a major mechanism
by which celecoxib and DMC can trigger tumor cell death in vitro
and in vivo (25, 32, 33). The initiating event seems to be the
inhibition of the sarcoplasmic/ER calcium ATPase (SERCA), which
is accomplished within seconds of adding celecoxib or DMC to
cultured cells and which results in extensive leakage of calcium
into the cytosol (25, 34, 35). As a consequence of this acute shift in
subcellular calcium distribution, severe ER stress is triggered. In the
continued presence of drug, the protective components of the ESR
are unable to restore proper calcium homeostasis, and therefore,
the proapoptotic arm of the ESR gains dominance and initiates
tumor cell death (25, 32–37).
In view of the differential ESR-inducing insults generated by
bortezomib and celecoxib/DMC, we set out to explore whether the
combination of these stressors would potentiate the antitumor
potency of these drugs. Our hypothesis was that the combination of
two effective triggers of ER stress (i.e., disturbed calcium
homeostasis and accumulation of obsolete proteins) would more
effectively overwhelm the protective features of the ESR and
therefore more potently stimulate tumor cell death. In this report,
we show that this is indeed the case. The addition of bortezomib
together with celecoxib or DMC to glioblastoma cells in culture
more severely triggered the ESR and caused substantially more cell
death than either drug alone. These events could also be shown in
xenograft tumor tissues from drug-treated animals, indicating that
these mechanisms have in vivo relevance. Taken together, our study
establishes bortezomib and celecoxib/DMC as a novel drug
combination that should be evaluated further as a potentially
effective anticancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Bortezomib was obtained from the pharmacy as 3.5 mg
Velcade suspended in 3.5 mL saline (Millennium Pharmaceuticals).
Celecoxib was obtained as capsules from the pharmacy or synthesized in
our laboratory according to previously published procedures (38). DMC is a
close structural analogue of celecoxib, where the 5-aryl moiety has been
altered by replacing 4-methylphenyl with 2,5-dimethylphenyl (18, 27); this
compound was synthesized in our laboratory according to previously
published procedures (27). Celecoxib and DMC were dissolved in DMSO at
100 mmol/L (stock solution) and added to the cell culture medium in a
manner that kept the final concentration of solvent below 0.1%. The COX-2–
inhibitory activity of freshly synthesized celecoxib, and lack thereof in DMC,
was confirmed in vitro with the use of purified COX-2 protein (see, for
example, ref. 23).
Cell lines and culture conditions. All cells were propagated in DMEM
(Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37jC
and a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Four human glioblastoma cell lines (LN229,
U251, T98G, and U87MG) and one multiple myeloma cell line (RPMI/8226)
were used. T98G, U87MG, and RPMI/8226 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. LN229 and U251 were obtained from
Frank B. Furnari (Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA). COX-2
expression levels and drug effects on prostaglandin production in these
cells have been published elsewhere (17, 19).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays
were performed in 96-well plates with the use of 3.0  103 to 8.0  103 cells
per well as described in detail elsewhere (26).
Cell death ELISA. Cells were plated in 96-well plates in quadruplicates
at 1,000 cells/mL (100 AL/well). The next day, they were treated with drugs

Cell growth and survival of various glioblastoma cell lines was determined by
MTT assay after 48 h of culture in the presence of increasing concentrations
of bortezomib (BZM ; A ), celecoxib (CXB ; B ), or DMC (C ). For comparison
purposes to the known anti–multiple myeloma effects of bortezomib, the
RPMI/8226 multiple myeloma cell line was included in A .

for 24 h and analyzed for the presence of histone-complexed DNA
fragments with the use of a commercially available ELISA kit (Roche
Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The kit was used
in a manner as to specifically quantitate apoptosis rather than necrosis.
Immunoblots and immunohistochemical staining. Total cell lysates
were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis as described earlier
(26). Immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression in tumor tissues
was performed with the use of the Vectastain avidin-biotin complex method
kit (Vector Laboratories) as described previously (25). The primary
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology or Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. and used according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. All immunoblots and stainings were repeated at least once to
confirm the results.

Enhanced Combination Drug Effects via ER Stress

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling staining of tumor tissue. Apoptosis in tumor sections was
measured quantitatively with the use of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. All components for this procedure were from the ApopTag In Situ Apoptosis
Detection kit (Chemicon), which was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells for each tumor section
was determined from 10 random photomicrographs taken at 200
magnification.
Transfections and colony formation assay. The different small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) were synthesized at the microchemical core
laboratory of the University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive
Cancer Center; their sequences are described in ref. 25. Transfections of
cells with these siRNAs and subsequent analysis of cell survival by colony
formation assay have been described in detail elsewhere (25).
Drug treatment of nude mice. Four- to 6-week-old male athymic nu/nu
mice were obtained from Harlan and implanted s.c. with 5  105 U87
glioblastoma cells. Once tumors of f300 mm3 had developed, the animals
received drug treatments. Velcade was given as a single dose via tail vein
injection. DMC was given twice daily (one half of the daily dose every 12 h)
via direct administration into the stomach with a stainless steel ball-head
feeding needle (Popper and Sons, Inc.). After a total of 50 h, the animals
were sacrificed and tumors were collected for analysis. In all experiments,
the animals were closely monitored with regards to body weight, food
consumption, and clinical signs of toxicity; no differences between non–
drug-treated control animals and drug-treated animals were detected.

To verify that bortezomib, at the concentrations we used, exerted
its established function (i.e., inhibition of the proteasome), we also
investigated the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the induction of ER stress markers coincided with
the appearance of highly elevated levels of polyubiquitinated
proteins, indicating that inhibition of the proteasome correlated
with the induction of ER stress.
The same targets were also investigated after treatment of cells
with either celecoxib or DMC. In all our experiments, celecoxib and
DMC consistently generated the same outcome, except that DMC
was slightly more potent [for this reason, and also because the
induction of ER stress by celecoxib has been reported earlier
(25, 32, 33), we will focus primarily on the results obtained with
DMC]. As shown in Fig. 2B, DMC treatment resulted in strong
induction of GRP78 and CHOP and activation of caspase-4,

Results
Glioblastoma multiforme represents a particularly difficultto-treat type of cancer with dismal prognosis. Because more
effective therapies are urgently needed, we chose various human
glioblastoma cell lines as a model to investigate combination effects
of our selected drugs. To establish the concentration of each drug
that would result in 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50), we first
treated each cell line individually with either bortezomib, celecoxib,
or the non-coxib celecoxib analogue DMC. The resulting IC50 after
48 h of treatment with bortezomib was f10 nmol/L for the U251,
U87MG, and T98G glioblastoma cell lines and slightly below
5 nmol/L for the LN229 glioblastoma cell line (Fig. 1A). Because
bortezomib was developed for multiple myeloma therapy and is
highly cytotoxic in such tumor cell lines, we also determined its IC50
in a representative multiple myeloma cell line, RPMI/8226, for
comparison purposes. As shown in Fig. 1A, and as expected, RPMI/
8226 cells exhibited high sensitivity toward bortezomib; however,
this cell type was not more sensitive than the glioblastoma cell lines.
This finding established that glioblastoma cells were exquisitely
sensitive to bortezomib, which supported our rationale for
investigating this drug as a potential glioblastoma therapy.
We also established the IC50 for celecoxib and DMC in all four
glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. 1A and B). Celecoxib displayed an IC50
of f50 Amol/L in U251, U87MG, and T98G cells, whereas DMC was
somewhat more potent with an IC50 of slightly below 40 Amol/L.
The LN229 cell line (which exhibited the greatest sensitivity to
bortezomib; Fig. 1A) was overall slightly less sensitive to either
celecoxib or DMC (Fig. 1A and B).
To determine the ability of bortezomib, celecoxib, and DMC to
induce the ESR in glioblastoma cells, we treated U251 cells with
increasing concentrations of each drug and analyzed various
indicators of ER stress. As shown in Fig. 2A, bortezomib caused
increased expression of GRP78 and CHOP, indicating that the ESR
was triggered. In addition, this drug also stimulated the activation
of the ER stress-associated procaspase-4, as indicated by the
appearance of the cleaved (i.e., activated) form of this enzyme.

glioblastoma cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of increasing
concentrations of bortezomib (A ) or DMC (B). Total cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blot with specific antibodies to ubiquitin, GRP78, CHOP, and
caspase-4. Actin was used as a loading control. Procaspase-4 (Pro-Casp-4 )
denotes the inactive caspase-4 proenzyme, whereas cleaved caspase-4 (Casp4 ) is indicative of the activated form of the enzyme. For comparison purposes,
cells treated with 10 nmol/L bortezomib were analyzed side by side to
DMC-treated cells in B, indicating that the amount of ubiquitination is much more
prevalent in bortezomib-treated cells than in DMC-treated cells. Note that in
the caspase-4 blots several nonspecific background bands were observed
(consistent with similar observations in the literature); the specific bands were
identified with the use of various controls (data not shown) and comparison
with the literature.

long-term surviving cells that were able to spawn a colony was determined 2 wk thereafter (colony formation assay). Columns, mean percentage of surviving cells from
triplicate experiments; bars, SD. The number of colonies obtained from non–drug-treated controls was set at 100%. In A to D , the following drug concentrations
were used: LN229: 5 nmol/L bortezomib, 60 Amol/L celecoxib, 40 Amol/L DMC; U251: 10 nmol/L bortezomib, 50 Amol/L celecoxib, 30 Amol/L DMC; U87MG: 5 nmol/L

cytostatic effects (i.e., the overall number of cells did not change
between 24 and 48 h). In contrast, when the drugs were applied in
combination, there was no increase in cell numbers at the 24-h time
point and substantial loss of viable cells between 24 and 48 h,
indicating potent cytotoxic effects.
The extent of drug-induced cell death and survival was further
investigated by cell death ELISA, which quantitates the amount of
apoptosis in the entire culture, and by colony formation assays,
which determine the number of individual cells able to survive
drug treatment long-term and spawn a colony of clonal
descendants. Figure 3C shows that treatment of glioblastoma cells
with individual drugs caused a small increase in apoptotic cell
death, whereas the combined treatment with bortezomib and
celecoxib or DMC resulted in greatly increased cell death. In colony
formation assays, 5 nmol/L bortezomib reduced the number of
emerging colonies by f50% (Fig. 3D). The chosen concentrations
of celecoxib and DMC by themselves exerted only minor inhibitory
effects (reduction of colony number by approximately 10–15%).
In contrast, when cells were treated with bortezomib and celecoxib

indicating that this drug triggered ER stress. However, this drug did
not cause substantial accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins,
consistent with the expectation that its mechanism of action was
different from that of bortezomib.
We next examined the effects of combination drug treatments
on glioblastoma cell growth and survival. For this purpose, we
combined bortezomib with either celecoxib or DMC at concentrations that represented approximate IC50 values so that
potentially enhancing effects would become apparent. Figure 3A
depicts a visual display of cell number and morphology, whereas
Fig. 3B presents the quantified outcome. Figure 3A reveals that
individual drug treatment resulted in a smaller increase in cell
number and the presence of fewer mitotic figures; in contrast,
combination drug treatment resulted in noticeable cell loss and
apparent cell death. These visual impressions were complemented
by counting the number of viable cells over the course of drug
treatment (at 8, 24, and 48 h). As displayed in Fig. 3B, single-drug
treatment allowed initial cell proliferation (i.e., increase in cell
numbers between 8 and 24 h) and then exerted presumed

Enhanced Combination Drug Effects via ER Stress

To investigate the role of apoptosis, the activity of various
caspases in response to drug treatment was determined. Activation
of each caspase can be detected by the appearance of a
proteolytically cleaved, smaller molecular weight form of the
protein. As shown in Fig. 4, the ER-associated caspase-4 and
caspase-7 were more strongly activated by combination drug
treatments than by individual drug treatments. In addition,
caspase-9, a member of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, was
activated by the drug combinations but was much less affected by
individual drugs. As well, the executioner caspase-3 was substantially more activated by the drug combinations than by individual
drugs. Finally, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), one of the
main substrates of activated caspase pathways and a wellestablished indicator of apoptotic cell death, was more effectively
cleaved in response to combination treatments than by individual
drug treatments (Fig. 4). Thus, these results reveal a close
correlation of ER stress induction, activation of ER stressassociated caspases, and additional apoptotic events that indicate
the dominance of proapoptotic mechanisms in response to
combination drug treatment.
To establish whether drug-induced ER stress and cellular
apoptosis were only correlative or were causally related, we
specifically reduced the expression of the ESR component GRP78. If
drug-induced cell death was controlled by the ESR, we would
expect that reduced levels of GRP78, which functions as a major
protective component of the ESR, would lead to further increased
cell death. U251 cells were transfected with siRNA against GRP78;
as a control, cells were transfected with siRNA against a target not
present in mammalian cells [i.e., green fluorescent protein (GFP)].
Both siGRP78-transfected and siGFP-transfected cells were treated
with bortezomib together with celecoxib or DMC, and the number

or DMC in combination, colony survival was greatly reduced by
>90% and 97%, respectively.
Each assay used in Fig. 3 was applied to several different
glioblastoma cell lines and varying concentrations of drug
combinations were used (data not shown). In all cases, very
similar outcomes were achieved, clearly indicating that the
combination of these drugs results in greatly increased cytotoxicity
and substantially reduced cell survival compared with treatment
with each drug individually. Furthermore, we calculated the
combination index (CI) from conventional MTT assays where
increasing concentrations of each drug were combined (data not
shown) and obtained a CI <1, revealing that the drug combination
effects were synergistic.
We next investigated the potential contribution of the ESR to the
above-presented combination drug effects. U87MG and T98G cells
were treated with the same drug combinations as above, and various
components of the ESR system and cell death machinery were
analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, individual drug treatments resulted in
increased expression of GRP78, and combination drug treatments
increased expression of this protein further. Levels of the
proapoptotic CHOP protein were weakly increased by single-drug
treatments but were more strongly elevated by combination
treatments. The activity of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), a
critical proapoptotic component of the ESR, was investigated with
antibodies specifically recognizing the phosphorylated (i.e., active)
form of this kinase. We found that combination drug treatments, but
not individual drug treatments, resulted in greatly increased JNK
activity (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these results indicate that
bortezomib, when combined with either celecoxib or DMC, caused
stronger ESR induction than either drug alone. Similar results were
also obtained with the use of LN229 and U251 cells (data not shown).

up-regulation of indicators of ER stress and

T98G (B ) cells were cultured in the presence of
10 nmol/L bortezomib, 50 Amol/L celecoxib, or
35 Amol/L DMC individually or in combination
as indicated for 24 h. Total cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blot with specific
antibodies to GRP78, CHOP, caspase-3
(casp-3 ), caspase-4, caspase-7 (casp-7 ),
caspase-9 (casp-9 ), PARP, and JNK, as
indicated. Actin was used as a loading control.
Procaspase denotes the full-length (inactive)
caspase proenzymes, whereas cleaved
caspases represent the activated forms of
these enzymes. The activity of JNK1 and
JNK2 was determined with the use of an
antibody that specifically recognizes JNK
phosphorylated on Thr183/Tyr185 (p-JNK1/2 ).
Equal amounts of JNK1 were confirmed with an
antibody that reacts with all JNK forms
present.

that the ESR played a causal role in triggering cell death induced by
bortezomib in combination with celecoxib or DMC.
Finally, we determined whether the above-described in vitro
events would also take place in vivo. U87MG cells were implanted
s.c. into nude mice, and after sizable tumors had formed, the
animals remained untreated or were treated with drugs. Celecoxib
was not included in this experiment because previous studies had
already shown that this drug potently stimulated the ESR in vivo
(25, 32); furthermore, all known experiments that compared DMC
to celecoxib have shown that both drugs reliably achieve the same
tumor-suppressive outcome in vitro and in vivo, except that DMC
consistently displays somewhat greater apoptosis-inducing potency
(18, 25–27, 30). Therefore, we decided on DMC as the more potent
drug of choice for the in vivo combination experiments with
bortezomib.
We had shown previously that DMC by itself quite potently
triggers ER stress in tumor tissue in vivo (25), and this effect begins
to appear at dosages of z10 mg/kg. Considering these earlier
results, we chose 7.5 mg/kg as a potentially useful dosage for this
combination experiment; we reasoned that suboptimal dosages of
DMC would allow the combination effects to emerge. Tumorbearing animals were treated with DMC or bortezomib alone or in
combination for 2 days (a relatively short treatment period was
chosen because we wanted to focus on the early mechanisms that
initiate cell death rather than the later conditions that dominate
when the tumor cells are dying or already are dead). Tumor tissue
was analyzed for the expression of CHOP (as a marker of ER stress)
and stained by TUNEL (to visualize the extent of apoptotic cell
death).
We found that DMC, at this very low dosage, did not cause much
elevated CHOP expression nor did it substantially increase TUNEL
staining (Fig. 6A). Bortezomib treatment by itself resulted in a
larger fraction of CHOP-positive cells, concomitant with increased
TUNEL staining. In comparison, when bortezomib was given
together with DMC, there was a very strong induction of CHOP,
which could be detected in every single cell, and an even greater
increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 6A). When the
number of TUNEL-positive cells in the various treatment groups
was quantitated, it became apparent that combination treatment
resulted in significantly more cell death than individual drug
treatment (Fig. 6B); that is, cell death in response to treatment with
bortezomib plus DMC was 4.9- and 3.0-fold higher than in animals
treated with DMC or bortezomib alone, respectively. Thus,
combination drug treatment resulted in substantially higher levels
of ER stress and a greater amount of cell death than individual drug
treatments and established that aggravated ER stress and
enhanced glioblastoma cell killing could be achieved in vivo as well.

Figure 5. Knockdown of GRP78 enhances cell killing by combination drug
treatment. U251 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed at GRP78
(siGRP78 ). As a control, a siRNA targeted at GFP (siGFP ) was used.
A, 72 h after transfection, parallel cultures were treated with 5 nmol/L bortezomib
combined with either 25 Amol/L celecoxib or 15 Amol/L DMC. In parallel,
transfected control cultures received no drug treatment or treatment with
solvent (DMSO) alone. After 48 h, the drugs were removed and the fraction
of surviving cells was determined by colony-forming assays over the course of
12 to 14 d. Shown is the percentage of surviving cells able to spawn a colony
(where the number of colonies under non–drug-treated conditions was set to
100%). The reduction in colony numbers in drug-treated siGRP78-transfected
versus drug-treated siGFP-transfected cells was statistically significant
(P < 0.002). B, to verify the effectiveness and specificity of the transfected
siRNAs, Western blot analysis of GRP78 expression was performed from
siGFP-transfected and siGRP78-transfected cells treated with the respective
drugs in parallel. Both of these blots were processed and developed
simultaneously and therefore can be directly compared side by side. Although
the down-regulation of GRP78 by its siRNA was not 100% effective, the levels of
this protein nonetheless were consistently lowered in each condition compared
with the matching control cells transfected with siGFP. Of note, overall lower
concentrations of each drug were used in this experiment to enable the
detection of further enhanced cell death by siRNA pretreatment.

of surviving cells was determined by colony formation assay. As
shown in Fig. 5A, cell survival was significantly (P < 0.002)
decreased in cells harboring reduced levels of GRP78; cell survival
after drug treatment was 63% to 68% in cells transfected with
siGFP but was decreased to 40% to 42% in cells transfected with
siGRP78. Down-regulation of GRP78 expression by siGRP78 was
confirmed by Western blot analysis; however, whereas the presence
of siGRP78 reduced basal levels of GRP78 below the detection limit,
the siRNA could not completely block the induction of GRP78 by
drug treatment, as lower levels of induced GRP78 protein could still
be detected (Fig. 5B). Nonetheless, under all conditions, the overall
amount of GRP78 protein was lower in siGRP78-transfected cells
than in siGFP-transfected cells. Concurrently, siGRP78-transfected
cells exhibited significantly increased chemosensitivity, indicating

Discussion
The critical contribution of the ESR to tumor cell growth and
survival has begun to be recognized only very recently (1–3). On
one hand, this system supports tumor cell survival under adverse
conditions, such as hypoxia, low glucose levels, or chemotherapeutic intervention, and recent evidence indicates that indeed
many tumor cells exhibit increased survival due to chronic ER
stress (39). On the other hand, if the stressful insult becomes too
severe and cannot be adequately neutralized, the ESR switches
from its protective function to its proapoptotic properties and
triggers cell death. Although the crucial relevance of these
mechanisms to tumor growth and survival is being recognized,

Enhanced Combination Drug Effects via ER Stress

(18, 25, 26), DMC was noticeably more potent than celecoxib. With
bortezomib, we found that all glioblastoma cell lines were highly
sensitive to this drug with IC50s of below 5 nmol/L (LN229 cell
line), 8 nmol/L (T98G), and 10 nmol/L (U87MG and U251). This
exquisite sensitivity was somewhat surprising in light of earlier
results indicating a wide range of sensitivities and even relative
bortezomib resistance of glioblastoma cell lines. For instance, Yin
et al. (41) reported IC50s for T98G, U87MG, and U343 cells of 9, 80,
and 800 nmol/L, and Styczynski et al. (42) determined these values
in T98G and U373 cells as 29 and 48 nmol/L, respectively. The
reason for these discrepancies between the same cell lines is
unclear (all studies used MTT assays); however, it is noted that,
when we included a representative multiple myeloma cell line to
allow direct, side-by-side comparisons of drug sensitivities, we
found that this cell line responded in line with the glioblastoma cell
lines tested (IC50 = 12 nmol/L; Fig. 1A). Thus, in contrast to
indications by earlier reports, bortezomib, which has been
approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, did not seem
to be less cytotoxic to glioblastoma cells.
When combined with either celecoxib or DMC, bortezomib
displayed greatly increased cytotoxicity (Fig. 3), and these enhanced
combination effects correlated closely with aggravated ER stress
(Fig. 4). ER stress was indicated by the increased expression or
activity of the following ESR components: (a) GRP78/BiP, an ER
chaperone and critical component of the protective arm of the ESR
(3); (b) CHOP/GADD153, a transcription factor and proapoptotic
constituent of the ESR (1); (c) JNK, a stress-activated kinase that
plays a proapoptotic role during the ESR and is involved in

very little is known with regards to their potential exploitation for
purposes of tumor therapy. We therefore investigated the possibility
that aggravating ER stress via the simultaneous application of two
different ESR-triggering drugs would lead to increased tumor
cell death.
For our experiments, we chose three different drugs that were
known to be able to trigger the ESR and cause tumor cell death.
Bortezomib triggers ESR secondary to the accumulation of
misfolded and otherwise damaged proteins (9, 10). Celecoxib and
its non-coxib analogue DMC stimulate ESR due to the inhibition of
SERCA and the subsequent leakage of calcium from the ER into the
cytosol (30, 34). Although not a Food and Drug Administration–
approved drug, DMC was included in this study because this
compound generally exhibits greater antitumor potency than
celecoxib in vitro and in vivo (18, 25, 30). In addition, because it
lacks COX-2–inhibitory function, the use of DMC permits the
evaluation of a potential role for COX-2 in the processes
investigated (23). This latter aspect is important in view of the
known life-threatening cardiovascular risks that have emerged with
the long-term use of coxibs and are associated with the selective
inhibition of COX-2 (40). In this regard, the absence of COX-2–
inhibitory potential in DMC might turn out to be advantageous, as
it is conceivable that the antitumor results might be achieved with
less of the coxib-associated side effects (23).
We found that, when applied as single-drug treatment,
bortezomib, celecoxib, and DMC dose dependently reduced the
growth and survival of various glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. 1).
Consistent with earlier results in several different tumor cell types

Figure 6. DMC enhances the effects of bortezomib on ER stress and apoptosis in vivo. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 1 mg/kg bortezomib and 7.5 mg/kg
DMC individually or in combination or remained untreated. Fifty hours later, the animals were sacrificed and the tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemical
(IHC ) staining for CHOP (ER stress indicator) or by TUNEL (apoptosis indicator). A, top, tumor tissue stained with CHOP antibodies; middle, enlarged areas

CHOP, requires minimum concentrations of each drug that are
well above 10 Amol/L (25, 32, 33). In comparison, increased
expression of GRP78 and CHOP can also be detected in tumor
tissues from animals treated with celecoxib or DMC (25, 32),
although the average concentrations of these drugs in vivo are
<10 Amol/L in serum and <0.3 Amol/L in tumor tissue (18, 25).
Although a solution to the conundrum of differential drug
concentration requirements between in vitro and in vivo
conditions has yet to be provided, these types of experiments
nonetheless strongly caution against the tendency to minimize
results that were obtained with the use of moderately high
micromolar concentrations of celecoxib and DMC in vitro. Our
present results shown in Fig. 6 further support this view, as they
clearly show the in vivo relevance of our study.
In summary, we have provided evidence that the combination of
two unrelated drugs, bortezomib and celecoxib/DMC, exerts
greatly increased cytotoxicity on glioblastoma cells. Each drug by
itself is able to induce ER stress by a different mechanism, and their
combination further aggravates ER stress to the point where the
protective components of this system are being overwhelmed and
the proapoptotic constituents gain dominance and effect tumor
cell death. Because the ESR already is chronically activated in some
tumor cells, there might be reduced competence to accommodate
additional insults that specifically target the ESR and therefore
might provide a therapeutic window for those drugs aimed at this
cellular mechanism.

mediating cell death induced by bortezomib (41, 43); (d) caspase-4,
which is localized to the ER and is involved in ER stress-induced
apoptosis (4, 44, 45); and (e) caspase-7, also an ER stress-associated
protein, whose activity is tightly regulated via the interaction with
GRP78 (46–48). We found that all of the above components were
more potently stimulated by combination drug treatments than by
individual drug treatments, clearly indicating the presence of severe
ER stress. In addition, activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
became evident by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and by
cleavage of PARP-1 (Fig. 5), which is consistent with the current
model of ER stress-induced apoptosis (1).
The causal relationship of drug-induced ER stress and ensuing
cell death was established via the knockdown of GRP78 expression
with siRNA. This type of approach has been used before to
establish the protective function of this ER chaperone during
treatment with celecoxib alone (32). In the present study, we show
that reduced levels of GRP78 protein significantly decreased the
survival of glioblastoma cells after combination treatment, showing
that when this protective ESR component is impaired, the cells
become even more sensitive to combination drug-induced cell
killing. In view of the established model of the ESR (1–3), we
surmise that, due to the loss of protection by GRP78, the
proapoptotic components of the ESR are able to intensify their
dominance and trigger more effective cell death.
In the past, studies that had used celecoxib and DMC received
the criticism that drug effects in vitro generally required much
higher concentrations than those that can be achieved in vivo in
the serum of patients or animals; it was therefore concluded that
the observed in vitro mechanisms might not be reflective of the
events taking place in vivo (49). Recently, however, several
studies verified that some of the high-concentration in vitro
effects can also be detected in xenograft tumor tissues in vivo.
For instance, the induction of ER stress by celecoxib and DMC
in vitro, as indicated by increased expression of GRP78 and
