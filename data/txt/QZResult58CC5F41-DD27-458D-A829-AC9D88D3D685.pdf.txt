Abstract
The targeting of antioxidant systems that allow stem-like cancer cells to avoid the adverse consequences of
oxidative stress might be expected to improve the efﬁcacy of cancer treatment. Here, we show that head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells that express variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) rely on the activity of the
cystine transporter subunit xCT for control of their redox status. xCT inhibition selectively induces apoptosis in
CD44v-expressing tumor cells without affecting CD44v-negative differentiated cells in the same tumor. In
contrast to CD44v-expressing undifferentiated cells, CD44v-negative differentiated cells manifest EGF receptor
(EGFR) activation and rely on EGFR activity for their survival. Combined treatment with inhibitors of xCTdependent cystine transport and of EGFR resulted in a synergistic reduction of EGFR-expressing HNSCC tumor
growth. Thus, xCT-targeted therapy may deplete CD44v-expressing undifferentiated HNSCC cells and concurrently sensitize the remaining differentiating cells to available treatments including EGFR-targeted therapy.

Introduction
Despite recent improvement in treatment of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the increase in
overall survival has been minimal, with treatment failure and
disease recurrence continuing to be a problem in many
patients (1). Tumor formation, relapse, and metastasis are
thought to be driven by a subpopulation of cancer cells.
These stem-like cancer cells are generally more resistant to
cancer treatments, including chemo- and radiotherapy,
compared with non–stem-like cancer cells (2–4). HNSCC
comprises a heterogeneous population of cancer cells, with
the CD44-expressing subpopulation having been shown to

possess the properties of stem-like cancer cells (5, 6). The
selective killing of CD44-expressing stem-like cancer cells
might therefore be required for effective therapy in patients
with HNSCCs.
CD44 is a major marker for stem-like cancer cells in many
epithelial tumors (2, 7–9) and is implicated in tumor growth,
invasion, and metastasis (10, 11). It exists in numerous variant
(v) isoforms generated through alternative mRNA splicing (12).
We recently showed that interaction of CD44v with the cystine
transporter subunit xCT (SLC7A11) stabilizes the latter protein
and thereby potentiates the ability of cancer cells to defend
themselves against reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 13, 14).
Given that cancer cells are exposed to environmental stressors
such as oxygen or nutrient deﬁciency, low pH, inﬂammatory
mediators, and ROS during tumor progression, the ability to
avoid the consequences of such exposure is required for cancer
cell survival. Stem-like cancer cells in which defense against
ROS is enhanced by CD44v are thus thought to drive tumor
growth, chemoresistance, and metastasis.
xCT functions together with CD98hc (SLC3A2) as an
Naþ-independent transporter (system xc) that mediates
exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate
and thereby promotes synthesis of reduced glutathione
(GSH; refs. 15, 16), an important intracellular redox buffer
that is associated with cancer cell resistance to anticancer
agents (17, 18). Cysteine availability is rate-limiting for GSH
synthesis (19), and xCT activity is therefore essential for
such resistance (16). Sulfasalazine is a speciﬁc inhibitor of
xCT-mediated cystine transport and inhibits the growth,
invasion, and metastasis of several types of cancer (20–22).

We recently showed that sulfasalazine treatment suppressed CD44v-dependent tumor growth and chemoresistance (13) as well as distant metastasis (14). However,
whether inhibition of xCT selectively damages stem-like
cancer cells, without affecting non–stem-like cancer cells,
has remained unclear. We therefore investigated the role of
xCT-mediated control of redox status in CD44v-expressing
cancer cells and examined whether sulfasalazine selectively
kills these stem-like tumor cells in vivo–.

Materials and Methods
Tissue specimens
HNSCC specimens were collected with informed consent
from patients who underwent surgery at Keio University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The specimens were subjected to immunostaining. Excision samples of HNSCCs (n ¼ 49) were divided
into a CD44v-positive group (n ¼ 19) and a CD44v-low or
-negative group (n ¼ 30). The CD44v-positive samples were
further divided into those from patients who had (n ¼ 12) or
had not (n ¼ 7) undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of the specimens
ranged from T1 to T4 and N0 to N1 (Supplementary Table S1).
The area positive for CD44v or involucrin immunoreactivity
was quantiﬁed with the use of BZ Analyzer software (Keyence)
and with a constant color threshold in 3 ﬁelds per slide. This
aspect of the study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Keio University School of Medicine (Tokyo, Japan).
Cell culture
HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. HSC-4 and
OSC19 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 and Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM), respectively, each supplemented with 10% FBS. The normal keratinocyte cell line
HaCaT was cultured in DMEM. All cell lines were maintained
under 5% CO2 at 37 C. HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells were
obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank and HaCaT cells from Cell
Lines Service. These cells were passaged in our laboratory for
fewer than 6 months after resuscitation. OSC19 cells were
obtained from Kanazawa University (Ishikawa, Japan) and
were tested negative for mycoplasma using PCR tests within
6 months before the experiments were carried out. For
assay of HNSCC cell differentiation, cells were seeded in
24-well NanoCulture plates (SCIVAX) at a density of 2  105
cells/mL.
GSH assay, tumor cell isolation and ﬂow cytometry, and
other methods
A GSH assay as well as tumor cell isolation and ﬂowcytometric analysis were conducted as previously described
(13, 14). Other experimental procedures are described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD and were analyzed with
the unpaired Student t test. A P value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
CD44v-positive area is increased in HNSCC tumors of
patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
To explore the clinical relevance of CD44v-expressing cells
in human HNSCC tumors, we examined CD44v expression in
tumor tissue of patients treated with (n ¼ 12) or without
(n ¼ 7) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Supplementary Table
S1). The relative area occupied by CD44v-expressing cells
was signiﬁcantly larger in tumors of patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy than in those of patients who
did not (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting that CD44v-positive
HNSCC cells are resistant to chemotherapy compared with
CD44v-negative cells. Furthermore, the expression level of
the differentiation marker involucrin tended to be reduced
in tumor tissue resected after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
compared with that obtained from patients not subjected to
chemotherapy (Fig. 1B and C). Together, these observations
suggested that cytotoxic chemotherapy might preferentially
kill CD44v-negative differentiated cells and that the remaining subpopulation of CD44v-positive cells expands after such
treatment.
xCT-mediated cystine transport supports the GSHdependent antioxidant system in highly CD44v-positive
HNSCC cells
The GSH-dependent antioxidant system promotes the
resistance of CD44v-expressing gastrointestinal cancer cells
to chemotherapy (13). To investigate whether a similar
CD44v-dependent mechanism is operative in HNSCC cells,
we examined the effects of cisplatin, whose cytotoxicity is
mediated, in part, by ROS (23), on the viability of 4 HNSCC
cell lines that differ in CD44v expression status (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S1A). OSC19 cells, in which CD44v is
expressed at a high level, were resistant to cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2B). HSC-2 cells, which also express CD44v at a
high level, albeit not as high as that in OSC19 cells, also
showed resistance to cisplatin, although not to the same
extent as did OSC19 cells. In contrast, HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells,
both of which express CD44v at a low level, were sensitive to
this drug. These results thus suggested that CD44v expression status is related to cisplatin resistance in these cell
lines.
Given that the GSH-dependent antioxidant system plays a
key role in cisplatin resistance as a result of its ability to
scavenge ROS (24), we examined the GSH levels of the 4 cell
lines. The abundance of GSH was greater in the highly CD44vpositive OSC19 and HSC-2 cells than in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells
(Fig. 2C). The intracellular GSH level thus also appeared related
to cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells. Given that CD44v
stabilizes the cystine transporter subunit xCT and thereby
potentiates cystine uptake and ROS defense in cancer cells (13),
we next examined the effects of sulfasalazine, a speciﬁc inhibitor of xCT-mediated cystine transport (25), on HNSCC cell
viability. Sulfasalazine markedly reduced the viability of the
highly CD44v-expressing OSC19 and HSC-2 cells, whereas it
affected that of HNSCC cells that express CD44v at a low level,
including HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells, to a lesser extent (Fig. 2D and

Supplementary Fig. S1B), with this pattern of cytotoxicity
contrasting with that observed for cisplatin. These data suggested that highly CD44v-positive HNSCC cells rely on xCTmediated cystine transport and consequent upregulation of
the GSH-dependent antioxidant system for cellular redox
homeostasis.
Sulfasalazine has been reported to inhibit not only the xCTmediated cystine transport but also NF-kB signaling (25, 26).
Accordingly, to examine further the functional relevance of
xCT expression in HNSCC cells, we determined the effects of

xCT knockdown on cell growth (Fig. 2E and F). Depletion of
xCT resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of the proliferation of
sulfasalazine-sensitive HSC-2 and OSC19 cells without affecting that of sulfasalazine-resistant HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells.
Similar results were obtained by CD44 knockdown in HSC-2
and OSC19 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). Together,
these results suggested that sulfasalazine-sensitive HNSCC
cells are dependent on the CD44v-xCT system for their survival
and proliferation to a greater extent than are sulfasalazineinsensitive cells.

xCT as a Therapeutic Target in CD44v-Positive HNSCC

Cell differentiation is associated with the loss of CD44v
and xCT dependency in HNSCC cells in vivo
To examine the effect of xCT inhibition on tumor formation
by highly CD44v-expressing HNSCC cells, we transplanted
HSC-2 and OSC19 cells into nude mice. Sulfasalazine signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of OSC19 tumors after 14 days of
treatment but did not affect the size of HSC-2 tumors even after
treatment for 28 days (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Thus, whereas both HSC-2 and OSC19 cells are sensitive to
sulfasalazine in vitro, only tumors formed by OSC19 cells are
sensitive to this drug in vivo.
To explore the mechanism underlying the difference in
sulfasalazine sensitivity of HSC-2 cells in vitro versus that in
vivo, we focused on histologic differences of tumors formed by
HSC-2 and OSC19 cells. Flow cytometry revealed that all HSC-2
and OSC19 cells express CD44v at a high level in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2B). However, immunoﬂuorescence analysis
showed that whereas tumors formed by OSC19 cells consisted
mostly of CD44v-positive cells, those formed by HSC-2 cells
comprised a heterogeneous population of CD44v-positive and
-negative cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CD44v-negative HSC-2
cells in established tumors expressed involucrin (Fig. 3B), a
marker of keratinocyte differentiation (27). These results suggested that HSC-2 cells give rise to differentiated tumor cells in
vivo, resulting in the formation of heterogeneous tumors,
whereas OSC19 cells generate homogeneous undifferentiated
tumors.
To examine whether tumor cell differentiation might affect
the response to sulfasalazine, we investigated the effects of 9cis-retinoic acid, which promotes the differentiation of a subset
of HNSCC cells including HSC-2 cells (28). In contrast to the
lack of effect of sulfasalazine, tumors formed by HSC-2 cells in
mice treated with retinoic acid were signiﬁcantly smaller than
those formed in control mice (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the
promotion of cell differentiation inhibits the growth of differentiated-type tumors formed by HSC-2 cells. Immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblot analyses showed that tumors formed in
sulfasalazine-treated mice contained a reduced number of
cells expressing CD44v compared with those formed in mice
treated with either saline or retinoic acid (Fig. 3D). Flow
cytometry also revealed that sulfasalazine selectively reduced
the proportion of highly CD44v-expressing tumor cells and
increased that of CD44v-negative cells (Fig. 3E). These ﬁndings
suggested that sulfasalazine targets highly CD44v-expressing
tumor cells.
Given that retinoic acid failed to reduce CD44v expression in
HSC-2 tumors (Fig. 3D) but inhibited tumor growth, we
examined whether CD44v expression might affect sensitivity
to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid failed to reduce CD44 expression
and to increase involucrin expression in HSC-2 and OSC19 cells
in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S2C). On the other hand, CD44

ablation increased the amount of involucrin mRNA in HSC-2
cells and this effect was enhanced by retinoic acid (Supplementary Fig. S2D), suggesting that a high level of CD44v
expression in HNSCC cells might confer resistance to the
induction of cell differentiation by retinoic acid. Together,
these results suggested that retinoic acid promotes differentiation in tumor cells with a low level of CD44v expression,
without affecting that in highly CD44v-expressing cells, and
thereby inhibits tumor growth.
To determine whether sulfasalazine actually induces apoptosis in CD44v-expressing tumor cells in vivo, we treated mice
bearing HSC-2 cell tumors with sulfasalazine for just 7 days.
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis revealed that the proportion of
CD44v-expressing tumor cells positive for the cleaved form of
caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, was increased by sulfasalazine treatment (Fig. 3F), suggesting that sulfasalazine selectively killed CD44v-expressing tumor cells. We then examined
whether the selective depletion of CD44v-expressing tumor
cells by sulfasalazine might enhance the antitumor effect of
cisplatin. The weight of HSC-2 tumors was markedly smaller
for mice treated with both cisplatin and sulfasalazine than for
those treated with saline or cisplatin alone (Supplementary Fig.
S2E). The abundance of CD44v in tumor lysates was increased
2.3-fold after cisplatin treatment, whereas it was reduced by
70% after the combined treatment with cisplatin and sulfasalazine (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Together, these results suggested that the selective depletion of CD44v-expressing stemlike tumor cells by sulfasalazine treatment indeed enhances
the cisplatin sensitivity of the differentiated-type tumors
formed by HSC-2 cells.
Cell differentiation is associated with loss of CD44v and
xCT dependency in HNSCC cells in vitro
We further examined whether differentiation reduces the
sensitivity of HNSCC cells to sulfasalazine with the use of an
adhesion-restricted culture system, which triggers keratinocyte differentiation in vitro (ref. 29; Fig. 4A). Culture under such
conditions induced expression of the differentiation markers
involucrin and cytokeratin 10 (CK10) in HSC-2, HSC-3, and
HSC-4 cells, but not in OSC19 cells, in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B). Conversely, the expression level of CD44v
was reduced in HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells, but not in
OSC19 cells, by adhesion restriction (Fig. 4B). Consistent with
our in vivo data, these results thus indicated that HSC-2, HSC-3,
and HSC-4 cells are able to undergo differentiation in response
to adhesion restriction in vitro whereas OSC19 cells are not.
We then examined the effects of sulfasalazine on HSC-2 and
OSC19 cells cultured under the adhesion-restricted condition.
The abundance of the cleaved form of caspase-3 was increased
in both HSC-2 and OSC19 cells after treatment with sulfasalazine under normal conditions (Fig. 4C). However, under the

EGF receptor activity is required for survival of
differentiating HNSCC cells
Given that the expression level of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is
associated with the differentiation capacity of human SCC cells
(30) and that EGFR gene ampliﬁcation has been detected in
HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells (31), which we found undergo
differentiation in response to adhesion restriction, we investigated EGFR expression in these HNSCC cell lines. The
expression and phosphorylation of EGFR were apparent at
only low levels in the differentiation-resistant OSC19 cells
compared with HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells, whereas expression of the EGFR-related protein HER2 did not differ substantially among the four cell lines (Fig. 5A). Flow cytometry also
revealed that the level of EGFR expression at the cell surface
was lower in OSC19 cells than in HSC-2 cells (Fig. 5B). These

1862

Cancer Res; 73(6) March 15, 2013

results thus suggested that EGFR signaling is suppressed in the
differentiation-resistant OSC19 cells.
In HSC-2 tumors, the abundance of phosphorylated EGFR
was high in CD44v-negative differentiated cells (Fig. 5C),
suggesting that the activation of EGFR signaling is associated
with differentiation of HNSCC cells. To examine this notion
further, we treated HSC-2 cells cultured under the adhesionrestricted condition with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
AG1478 or with the EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab.
Inhibition of EGFR signaling by either agent resulted in
downregulation of the differentiation marker involucrin and
in the cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that activation of EGFR signaling is required for the
survival of HNSCC cells that are exposed to a differentiation
stimulus.

analysis of xCT and CD44v expression at the surface of HSC-2 cells transfected with control or CD44 siRNAs. Cells were stained with antibodies
to CD44v9 and to xCT. B, viability of HSC-2 cells stably expressing control or CD44 shRNAs and incubated for 24 hours with various concentrations of

C, immunoblot analysis of phospho-EGFR, EGFR, and CD44v in HSC-2 or OSC19 cells transfected with control or CD44 siRNAs. The intensity of the
phospho-EGFR band normalized by that of the corresponding EGFR band is shown as fold increase relative to that for control cells. D, viability of HSC-2 cells

corresponding value for nontreated cells and are mean  SD from 3 independent experiments.   , P < 0.01. E, weight of tumors formed by HSC-2 cells in nude
mice treated daily with sulfasalazine (250 mg/kg) or every 4 days with cetuximab (500 mg), as indicated, for 4 weeks. Control mice received saline.
Data are mean  SD for 5 mice per group.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01. F, effects of xCT-targeted and EGFR-targeted therapies on undifferentiated or differentiated
HNSCC cells. CD44v expression promotes xCT-dependent cystine transport and thereby boosts the GSH-dependent antioxidant system in undifferentiated
HNSCC cells. Reduced adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix, a stimulus for terminal differentiation, results in down-regulation of CD44v expression.
EGFR is activated in CD44v-negative HNSCC cells and promotes cell survival during differentiation. Combined treatment with inhibitors of xCT-dependent
cystine transport and of EGFR may therefore kill HNSCC cells in a cooperative manner.

CD44v expression enhances xCT dependency but reduces
EGFR dependency
To examine whether CD44 ablation in HNSCC cells affects
the surface expression of xCT, we conducted ﬂow cytometry
with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the surface
complex of xCT and CD98hc (13). Ablation of CD44 by
transfection of cells with CD44 siRNA reduced the amount
of xCT at the surface of HSC-2 cells (Fig. 6A) as well as of
OSC19 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A), suggesting that CD44v
promotes the surface expression of the xCT-CD98hc complex
in HNSCC cells. Concomitant with the downregulation of xCT
expression, the intracellular GSH content was reduced in
HSC-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3D) or OSC19 (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D) cells by transfection with CD44

siRNA. Furthermore, we conﬁrmed the interaction of xCT
with CD44v in both HSC-2 and OSC19 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3E). Together, our observations suggested that CD44v
stabilizes xCT at the cell surface and thereby promotes
cystine transport by xCT and consequent GSH synthesis in
HNSCC cells.
We next examined the effect of CD44 expression on sulfasalazine sensitivity in HNSCC cells. The effect of sulfasalazine
on the viability of HSC-2 cells expressing CD44 short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) was attenuated compared with that apparent for
those expressing a control shRNA (Fig. 6B) and was similar to
that for HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells (Fig. 2D), which express CD44v
at only a low level, suggesting that CD44v expression determines the xCT dependency of HNSCC cells.

We then examined the relation between CD44 expression
and EGFR activity. The amount of phosphorylated EGFR was
increased 1.6- to 2.0-fold in CD44-depleted HSC-2 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6C). However, such an effect of
CD44 ablation on EGFR phosphorylation was not observed in
OSC19 cells, which express EGFR at only a low level (Fig. 5A and
B), suggesting that CD44 contributes to the modulation of
EGFR activity in EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cells. Furthermore, the growth-inhibitory effect of the EGFR inhibitor
AG1478 was signiﬁcantly increased by CD44 ablation in
HSC-2 cells (Fig. 6D). Together, these results suggested that
differentiated HNSCC cells that express CD44v at only a low
level rely on the activation of EGFR signaling rather than on
xCT activity for their survival.
We investigated the effect of combined treatment with
cetuximab and sulfasalazine on tumor growth in the HSC-2
mouse xenograft model. Sulfasalazine signiﬁcantly increased
the antitumor effect of cetuximab (Fig. 6E), suggesting that
xCT-targeted therapy might enhance the effect of EGFR-targeted therapy in EGFR-overexpressing HNSCCs.
Finally, we investigated the relevance of sulfasalazine sensitivity to the sensitivity to EGFR-targeted agents in HNSCC
cells. We conducted microarray analysis with OSC19 cells,
which express CD44v at a high level and are sensitive to
sulfasalazine, and with HSC-4 cells, which express CD44v at
only a low level and are insensitive to sulfasalazine, and we then
conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 32). The
OSC19/HSC-4 gene set proﬁle was signiﬁcantly similar to the
cetuximab-resistant/-sensitive HNSCC proﬁle (Supplementary
Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S2). Sulfasalazine-sensitive
OSC19 cells thus manifest a cetuximab resistance–like gene
signature when compared with sulfasalazine-insensitive HSC4 cells. Collectively, our data suggest that xCT-targeted therapy
selectively damages CD44v-expressing tumorigenic HNSCC
cells that manifest a high level of intracellluar GSH and
resistance to both conventional cancer therapy and EGFRtargeted therapy.

Discussion
A key challenge remaining for anticancer therapy is the
selective killing of cancer cells on the basis of cancer-speciﬁc
features (33, 34). The ability to avoid the consequences of
oxidative stress is a feature of stem-like cancer cells (3). We
recently showed that the interaction of CD44v with xCT
enhances the ability of stem-like cancer cells to defend
against ROS and thereby promotes tumor growth (13) and
metastasis (14), suggesting that CD44v-expressing stem-like
tumor cells rely on xCT-mediated cystine transport for their
survival and propagation in vivo. We have now shown that the
proliferation and survival of CD44v-expressing HNSCC cells
depend on xCT-mediated cystine transport and that inhibition of xCT by sulfasalazine selectively triggers apoptosis in
CD44v-expressing undifferentiated tumor cells. Furthermore,
ablation of CD44v by RNA interference attenuated xCT
dependency but enhanced EGFR dependency in HSC-2 cells.
Together, our results suggest that upregulation of the GSH
antioxidant system by the CD44v–xCT complex plays a key

role in regulation of redox status in CD44v-expressing HNSCC
cells.
Like many epithelial tumors, HNSCC is composed of a
heterogeneous population of cancer cells corresponding to
different stages of differentiation, and such heterogeneity may
affect the response to cancer therapy (5, 6). Epidermal homeostasis depends on a balance between stem cell renewal and
differentiation and is regulated by extrinsic signals from the
extracellular matrix, with human epidermal stem cells having
been shown to undergo terminal differentiation under conditions of restricted adhesion (29). HSC-2 cells, but not OSC19
cells, were found to differentiate into CD44-negative, involucrin-positive cells under such conditions. Furthermore, such
differentiated HSC-2 cells showed resistance to sulfasalazine
treatment, suggesting that differentiated HNSCC cells do not
rely on the xCT-dependent antioxidant system for control of
their redox status.
CD44-expressing stem-like cells in human HNSCC tumors
play a central role in resistance to cancer therapy (5, 6). Indeed,
our analysis of clinical HNSCC specimens showed that CD44vpositive tumor cells selectively survive and increase in number
after chemotherapy. These observations suggest that deﬁnitive
treatment should target the highly CD44-expressing cell subpopulation. We found that sulfasalazine selectively damaged
the CD44v-expressing cell subpopulation in HSC-2 tumors,
which are composed of both CD44v-positive undifferentiated
cells and CD44v-negative differentiated cells, as well as
enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. The volume of HSC-2
tumors was little affected by sulfasalazine treatment, however,
compared with that of OSC19 tumors, which are composed
mostly of CD44v-positive cells. It is thus possible that CD44v–
xCT plays a key role in the maintenance of established undifferentiated tumors rather than differentiated-type tumors.
Both EGFR and the extracellular Ca2þ concentration inﬂuence keratinocyte differentiation (30, 35). We found that the
EGFR-targeting agents AG1478 and cetuximab downregulated
the differentiation marker involucrin and induced apoptosis in
differentiating HNSCC cells that do not express CD44v, suggesting that CD44v-negative HNSCC cells rely on EGFR activity
for survival. Furthermore, ablation of CD44v enhanced EGFR
activation as well as EGFR dependency in EGFR-overexpressing HSC-2 cells, without affecting EGFR activation in OSC19
cells, which express EGFR at a low level. A high level of CD44v
expression may therefore suppress the clustering of EGFR at
the surface of HNSCC cells and thereby negatively regulate
EGFR signaling in the absence of a differentiation stimulus. In
EGFR-overexpressing HNSCCs, downregulation of CD44v during differentiation may thus increase dependency on EGFR
signaling and thereby enhance sensitivity to EGFR-targeted
therapy. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that reduced expression of CD44v in differentiating HNSCC cells enhances the
sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapy, whereas it diminishes the
effect of xCT-targeted therapy (Fig. 6F).
Several types of cancer cells, including prostate, pancreatic,
and breast cancer cells, are highly sensitive to sulfasalazine
treatment (20, 36, 37). In addition to such cell type speciﬁcity,
our present data suggest that CD44v expression status might
predict the sensitivity of heterogeneous HNSCC tumors to

xCT-targeted therapy. Such targeted therapy might deplete
CD44v-expressing undifferentiated HNSCC cells and concurrently sensitize the remaining differentiating cells to available
treatments including EGFR-targeted therapy.
