ABSTRACT
HER2 is overexpressed in about 20% of breast cancers and contributes to
poor prognosis. Unfortunately, a large fraction of patients have primary or acquired
resistance to the HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab, thus a multi-drug combination
is utilized in the clinic, putting significant burden on patients. We systematically
identified an optimal HER2 siRNA from 76 potential sequences and demonstrated its
utility in overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib
in 18 HER2-positive cancer cell lines. We provided evidence that the drug-resistant
cancer maintains dependence on HER2 for survival. Importantly, cell lines did not
readily develop resistance following extended treatment with HER2 siRNA. Using
our recently developed nanoparticle platform, systemic delivery of HER2 siRNA to
trastuzumab-resistant tumors resulted in significant growth inhibition. Moreover,
the optimal HER2 siRNA could also silence an exon 16 skipped HER2 splice variant
reported to be highly oncogenic and linked to trastuzumab resistance.

FDA-approved targeted therapies for HER2positive breast tumors include trastuzumab (Herceptin®,
Genentech), pertuzumab (Perjeta®, Genentech), T-DM1
(Kadcyla®, Genentech) and lapatinib (Tykerb®, Norvatis).
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are humanized monoclonal
antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of the
HER2 receptor and block receptor dimerization, thus
preventing receptor activation [7]. T-DM1 is trastuzumab
conjugated to the cytotoxic agent emtansine. Lapatinib is
a small molecule dual kinase inhibitor that actively blocks
HER2 signaling by binding to the HER2 and/or EGFR
kinase domain [8]. Despite the use of the aforementioned
HER2-targeted therapies, patients with advanced HER2positive breast cancer still develop resistance to the best
combination regimens (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and
docetaxel) and progression-free survival is still only 18.5
months [9]. Clearly, more durable treatments are needed.
Recent studies have shown the potential use of
HER2 siRNA as therapeutics for treating HER2-positive
breast cancer [10, 11]. One group has demonstrated
its potential to overcome resistance to trastuzumab

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death
among women in the United States. Among various
subtypes of breast cancer, overexpression and amplification
of the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2
(HER2; ErbB2/neu) accounts for about 20% of all cases
and is a predictor of aggressive phenotype and poor
prognosis [1]. HER2, a member of the HER family, is a
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and has been
well characterized as an oncogenic driver of human breast
and ovarian cancer [2]. Activation of HER2 downstream
signaling requires either self-dimerization or dimerization
with other HER family members [3]. Downstream signaling
is mainly mediated through activation of AKT and ERK
pathways, leading to cellular proliferation and survival [4].
Overexpression of HER2 increases downstream activity
by increasing the probability of homo- and heterodimer
formation [5] and/or by increasing the production of a
highly oncogenic HER2 splice variant that lacks exon 16
hereafter referred to as delta16 HER2 [6].

[12]. However, these works have been limited to in
vitro studies due to the lack of readily available in vivo
delivery platforms. In addition, the siRNA sequences
used in prior works have not been systematically
screened. Some studies have infected cancer cells ex vivo
with HER2 siRNA [13] or shRNA [14] prior to tumor
inoculation in order to demonstrate the in vivo activity
of HER2 suppression. However, to make RNAi clinically
relevant, effective in vivo delivering of siRNA to tumors
is necessary. Although viral-based siRNA and shRNA
strategies are effective, concerns regarding immunogenic
response and insertional mutagenesis remain major issues
[15]. Recent advances in nanobiotechnology have made
non-viral based siRNA delivery viable. Inoue et al. showed
that a polymalic acid-based nanobiopolymer conjugated
with HER2 antisense and trastuzumab can inhibit tumor
growth in BT474 tumor xenografts [16]. Two additional
studies have utilized siRNA against PLK1 delivered
systemically with peptide fusion protein [17] or PLA-PEG
[18] to successfully treat BT474 tumors in mice. However,
these studies utilized BT474 derived tumors, which are
sensitive to trastuzumab.
This article addresses several aforementioned
shortcomings in the field. We have identified the
most optimal HER2 siRNA duplex from a pool of 76
potential sequences. We then demonstrate the in vitro
efficacy of the optimal HER2 siRNA to overcome both
intrinsic and acquired drug resistance in HER2-positive
cancer cell lines, followed by the in vivo efficacy by
utilizing our recently optimized nanoparticle platform
[19] to systemically deliver siRNA to solid tumors. We
elucidate that the drug-resistant cancer still relies on
HER2 pathways, substantiating the utility of a HER2
siRNA treatment strategy to overcome drug resistance.
Importantly, we also address whether HER2-positive
cancer can develop resistance to HER2 siRNA after longterm treatment as it does with HER2-targeted therapies.
Lastly, we show that our optimal HER2 siRNA can silence
both wild-type HER2 and the more oncogenic delta16
HER2 splice variant to the same extent.

positive breast cancer cell lines (BT474, SKBR3,
and HCC1954) were measured following 5 days of
transfection with 10 nM of each individual HER2 siRNA
sequence (Figure 1A).
We retested the ability of the ten sequences with the
highest knockdown efficiency to inhibit growth of BT474,
SKBR3, HCC1954, HCC1569, and JIMT1 (Figure 1B).
The five most effective sequences from this evaluation
were further ranked according to the number of off-target
matches by utilizing BLAST (BLASTN 2.2.31+, RefSeq,
NCBI Reference Sequence Database) with a minimum
threshold of 70% sequence homology (Figure 1C). The
sequences d75 and d4 had the fewest off-target matches
and were further validated in a larger panel of 18 HER2positive cell lines (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure
S1A) and 2 HER2-negative cell lines (Figure 1E). Both
sequences yielded comparable cell killing in the 18 cell
lines and showed similar treatment specificity (i.e., were
less likely to kill HER2-negative cells). However, d75
had fewer off-target matches than d4 (2 vs. 6) and d75
generated more consistent mRNA knockdown and cell
viability reduction among the HER2-positive cell lines
tested. Low off-target was also apparent when tested
in T47D (HER2-negative) cell line, in which GI50 was
not achieved even when the concentration of d75 was
increased to 80 nM (Supplementary Figure S1B). We
selected sequence d75 for further development based
on these results. Henceforth, d75 will be referred to as
siHER2d75 and the AllStar non-targeting control siRNA
will be referred to as siControl (Supplementary Table S2).
The ability of siHER2d75 to decrease HER2
protein levels and induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest was assessed subsequently (Figure 2). Visual
and quantitative analyses of the intensity of anti-HER2
immunofluorescence staining before and after treatment
with siHER2d75 showed that HER2 protein levels on
the cellular membrane and in the cytoplasm decreased
significantly in BT474 cells after 10 nM siHER2d75
treatment for 72 h (Figure 2A–2B). We confirmed the
reduction of HER2 protein levels by western blot analysis
(Figure 2C). Similar results were also found in SKBR3
and HCC1954 cells (Supplementary Figure S2). The
siHER2d75 treatment significantly increased the fraction of
BT474 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle 48 and 72
hours post-treatment compared to siControl (p<0.001 and
p<0.014 for 48 and 72 hours, respectively; Figure 2D–2E)
and increased apoptotic response by approximately 4-fold
over the siControl at 72 h post-transfection (p<0.018;
Figure 2F).

RESULTS
Screening and validation of HER2 siRNA
76 potential HER2 siRNA candidates plus 2
scrambled siRNAs, an siRNA against luciferase and an
siRNA against GFP, were tested for their HER2 mRNA
knockdown efficiency in the HER2-positive cell lines
BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954. The 76 siRNAs against
HER2 were designed to target sequences distributed
across the whole coding region of the human ErbB2 gene
(NM_001005862). All siRNAs had 3’ UU overhangs and
no additional modifications. The sequences of all HER2
siRNAs and control siRNAs are listed in Supplementary

trastuzumab and lapatinib in vitro. They also represent
HER2 amplification in both the luminal and basal
subtypes. The concentrations of trastuzumab and lapatinib
needed to inhibit growth by 50% (GI50) in Figure 3A–3B
are summarized in Table 1. BT474 was sensitive to both
trastuzumab and lapatinib with GI50 values of 0.12 μg/ml
and 0.05 μM, respectively. However, JIMT1 was highly
resistant to both HER2-targeted therapies, and HCC1954
showed a marginal response to lapatinib (GI50 of 0.39
μM) and was largely resistant to trastuzumab. Although
lapatinib showed some ability to inhibit growth in all
three cell lines, the dose required to inhibit the resistant
cell lines (HCC1954 and JIMT1) exceeded 2 μM, which
starts to be toxic to some HER2-negative cells [20]. Not
surprisingly, differential sensitivity to siHER2d75 was
also observed across the three cell lines (Figure 3C, with
representative HER2 reduction in Figure 3D) as evident
in the calculated GI50 values, which ranged from 0.19 to
6.78 nM (Table 1). However, an siHER2d75 dose of only
10 nM could inhibit the growth of BT474, HCC1954, and

JIMT1 by 95%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. This suggests
that the intrinsically resistant HCC1954 and JIMT1 cell
lines still require HER2 for growth, and silencing of
HER2 using siRNA in the low nanomolar range is a viable
therapeutic strategy.
Previous studies have reported a positive correlation
between the efficacy of trastuzumab and lapatinib and the
elevated protein expression of HER2 [20, 21]. We found
that response to siHER2d75 in BT474, HCC1954 and
JIMT1 was also proportional to HER2 protein expression
levels (Figure 3E). We investigated the correlation
between HER2 protein levels and siRNA induced growth
inhibition by measuring GI50 values for siHER2d75 in
16 HER2-positive cell lines with varied HER2 levels
(Figure 3E), many of which were resistant to trastuzumab
or both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Indeed, the HER2
protein levels of the 16 cells were largely predictive of
their response to siHER2d75 as shown in Figure 3F. One
exception was the UACC893 cell line, which has the
highest HER2 expression but only moderately responded

to siHER2d75 treatment. One possible explanation is that
this cell line harbors a PIK3CAH1074R mutation, which
can result in AKT activation independent of HER2 [22].
Nonetheless, the GI50 values for all these cell lines ranged
between 0.15 and 7 nM, thus still supporting the potency
of siHER2d75 in achieving growth inhibition. In general,
HER2 protein level was more predictive of the response
to siHER2d75 than HER2 mRNA level generated with
RNAseq [23] (Supplementary Figure S3).

(Figure 4E). Importantly, we did not observe significant
resistance to siHER2d75 in these two derivatives (Figure
4C & 4F) although the siHER2d75 GI50 did increase from
0.19 nM to 0.75 nM in the BT474-LR cell line (Table 1).

Impact of siHER2d75 and lapatinib on
phosphorylation status of HER2, AKT an ERK
Lapatinib inhibits HER2 signaling by binding
to the HER2 kinase domain and in so doing, decreases
phosphorylation of HER2, AKT and ERK [20]. We
assessed phosphorylation status of HER2, AKT and ERK
in the lapatinib-resistant BT474-LR cell line in order to
gain mechanistic insight into the cellular responses to
increasing doses of lapatinib and siHER2d75 treatment
(Figure 4G). We focused on BT474-LR since it was
resistant to both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Untreated
BT474-LR displayed a level of phosphorylated HER2
similar to that in the parental BT474. This suggests
that BT474-LR cells are still dependent on HER2
signaling. Lapatinib given at 100 nM could block the
phosphorylation of HER2, AKT and ERK in the parental
BT474 at 72 h post-treatment, whereas a dose of 500 nM
was barely able to do so in BT474-LR. On the other hand,
10 nM siHER2d75 was effective in BT474-LR displaying
reduced phosphorylation of HER2, AKT and ERK to

Overcoming acquired resistance to trastuzumab
and lapatinib with siHER2d75
We used the BT474 cell line to study acquired
resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib. Briefly, BT474
cells were selected in our lab in the presence of increasing
concentrations of lapatinib (0.05-1 μM) or trastuzumab
(10-30 μg/ml) over a period of 6 months, similar to
the method published by Wang et al. [12]. These two
cell line derivatives were referred to as BT474-TR for
Trastuzumab-Resistant and BT474-LR for LapatinibResistant. We measured the responses of BT474-TR and
BT474-LR to trastuzumab, lapatinib or siHER2d75. BT474TR was resistant to trastuzumab (Figure 4A) but remained
sensitive to lapatinib (Figure 4B), while BT474-LR was
resistant to both trastuzumab (Figure 4D) and lapatinib

levels that were similar to those achieved in the parental
BT474. This correlates well with our finding (Figure 4F)
that the sensitivity of BT474-LR to siHER2d75 was still on
par with that of the parental BT474.

S4A). Thus, the siHER2d75 transfection was repeated at
7-day intervals when medium change was also needed.
Immunofluorescence imaging (Supplementary Figure
S4B) confirmed that HER2 reduction occurred uniformly
across the BT474 cell population. Because 1 nM
siHER2d75 did not eradicate the entire cell population, cells
that survived under low HER2 conditions were selected
over the 15 weeks. After 15 weeks, the remaining cells
designated BT474-H15, HCC1954-H15 and JIMT1-H15
were expanded upon the withdrawal of siHER2d75 for
further characterization. Without siHER2d75, the rebound
of HER2 expression to the level of the naïve cells (never
been treated with siHER2d75) was observed within a week
(Supplementary Figure S4C).
The responses of the repeatedly transfected cells
to varied doses of siHER2d75 were not significantly
different between the C15 and H15 populations generated
from BT474, HCC1954, and JIMT1 (Figure 5A–5C,
respectively). Also, the cells had not developed resistance
to either trastuzumab (Figure 5D–5F) or lapatinib (Figure
5G–5I) following prolonged siHER2d75 treatment,
illustrating that cells receiving extended siHER2 treatment

We next asked whether HER2-positive cells can
develop resistance to siHER2d75 after extended treatment.
We assessed that by treating BT474, HCC1954 and JIMT1
cells with 1 nM siHER2d75 or siControl weekly for 15
weeks. The resulting cell line derivatives were designated
as BT474-H15, HCC1954-H15 and JIMT1-H15 (siHER2
for 15 weeks), and BT474-C15, HCC1954-C15 and
JIMT1-C15 (siControl for 15 weeks). One nanomolar of
siHER2d75 was sufficient to reduce the expression of HER2
by approximately 98% in BT474, 72% in HCC1954,
and 95% in JIMT1 cells (Figure 3D). When leaving 1
nM siHER2d75 in the medium following transfection,
the silencing effect as gauged by HER2 mRNA level
reduction lasted for at least 7 days (Supplementary Figure

still depend on HER2. In contrast, a slight increase in
sensitivity to lapatinib especially at the higher dose
range was observed with the H15 populations (vs. C15
counterparts) generated from BT474 and HCC1954
(Figure 5G & 5H).
Figure 5J shows the phosphorylation state of
signaling molecules in the HER2 pathway of the C15
and H15 populations. The protein profiles of H15 lines
before treatment were comparable to those of C15. The
apparent slight upregulation of phosphorylation of ERK

in BT474-H15 was not significant once normalized to
the GAPDH band intensity. Both C15 and H15 cells
responded similarly to treatment with siHER2d75 in terms
of HER2 silencing and inhibition of phosphorylation of
HER2, AKT and ERK. Figure 5K shows that lapatinib
and trastuzumab were able to inhibit phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK in BT474-H15. The effect of trastuzumab
was less pronounced than that of lapatinib, which has
previously been shown to be more effective at blocking
HER2 signaling [12]. Collectively, these results suggest

signaling pathway after extended siHER2d75 treatment and
are much less prone to develop resistance to siHER2d75
than to trastuzumab or lapatinib.

was upregulated, while delta16 HER2 was not. siHER2d75
silenced both HER2 isoforms as shown by similar percent
reduction in mRNA levels in BT474 cells at 48 h posttransfection (vs. siControl) (Figure 6D), confirming its
broad specificity. This agrees with data from BT474-H15
(receiving a long term treatment of siHER2d75) that there
is no significant change in delta16 HER2/WT HER2 ratio
compared to the parental BT474 cells (Figure 6C).

Silencing delta16 HER2 with siHER2d75
The delta16 HER2 is a more oncogenic variant of
HER2 and has been implicated in tumor aggressiveness.
Studies have shown that only 5 copies of delta16 HER2 are
needed to drive oncogenic transformation, whereas 30-50
copies of WT HER2 were needed to initiate tumorigenesis
[24]. Delta16 HER2 has also been implicated in cancer
resistance to trastuzumab [25] and tamoxifen [26].
Therefore, the elimination of delta16 HER2 is of great
therapeutic value. We hypothesize that since siHER2d75
targets a region upstream of exon 16, it should be able to
silence both delta16 HER2 and WT HER2 with similar
efficacy. Figure 6A–6C shows the mRNA levels of wildtype HER2, delta16 HER2, and their ratios in parental
BT474, BT474-TR, BT474-LR, and BT474-H15. A
slight increase in the ratio of delta16 HER2 over WT
HER2 was observed in BT474-TR, compared to that in
parental BT474 (p < 0.01). In BT474-LR, the WT HER2

To show clinical and translational potential, we
systemically delivered siHER2d75 to HER2-positive
breast tumors with trastuzumab-conjugated mesoporous
silica based nanoconstructs (designated “T-NP”)
recently reported by us [19]. The silica core has a
uniform diameter of 50 nm and is further modified
with the addition of layers of polyethylenimine (PEI),
polyethyleneglycol (PEG), trastuzumab, and siRNA
(Figure 7). The hydrodynamic size of the particles is 104
± 1.7 nm and the zeta potential is 8.10 ± 0.3 mV in 10 nM
NaCl after loading of siHER2d75. When delivered with
our nanoparticles, siHER2d75triggered less or comparable

immune response when compared to the FDA-approved
nanoparticle based drugs Abraxane and Feraheme [19].
The material given IV could treat intrinsically resistant
HCC1954 tumors (significantly after a couple doses) and
knock down 60% of HER2 protein in the tumors after
one dose [19].
Here we show that the T-siHER2d75-NP could
also treat a BT474 variant with acquired resistance
to trastuzumab. The BT474 variant was developed in
Kerbel’s lab [27] by serial passaging BT474 in mice
for 3 years. The resulting tumors grow aggressively in
mice without estrogen supplement (unlike the parental
BT474 tumors). After 2-6 months of trastuzumab
treatment (20 mg/kg twice weekly, IP), the tumor that
developed resistance was adapted into tissue culture.
We subsequently passaged the cells in mice once more
to further select for those that grew aggressively.
These new tumors were adapted into culture and
named BT474-TRgf. In addition to being selected with
trastuzumab in vivo, the BT474-TRgf maintained its
resistance to trastuzumab in vitro (Figure 8A). Figure
8B shows that the BT474-TRgf cell grown in mice
still responds well to our T-siHER2d75-NP treatment,
compared to the untreated or T-siSCR-NP. The tumors
also showed a better response to our T-siHER2d75-NP
than free trastuzumab, given IV (twice weekly) at the
equivalent dose to that of the nanoconstructs. The fact
that tumors were not responsive to T-siSCR-NP also

indicates that growth inhibition is due to siHER2, rather

We evaluated the cytotoxicity of T-siHER2d75NP in normal/non-tumorigenic (HER2-negative) cells
including HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells),
HEPG2 (human liver hepatocellular cells), MCF10A
(human mammary epithelial cells), and HUVEC (human
umbilical vein endothelial cells) as shown in Figure 9.
Kidney and liver cell lines have been recommended
by the Nanotechnology Characterization Lab (NCL)
of NCI for cytotoxicity studies of nanoparticles since
kidney and liver are clearance organs for nanoparticles
[28, 29]. MCF10A is considered a normal counterpart
of breast cancer, and HUVEC is a relevant cell model
for intravenous administration of nanoparticles.
Figure 9A shows that these cells have no detectable
HER2 expression when compared to BT474. At the
efficacious dose for killing cancer cells [19], Figure
9B shows that our T-siHER2d75-NP did not elicit
significant cytotoxicity in any cell line tested (<10%
cell death). T-siHER2d75-NP appeared safer than the
drug benchmark, APAP, recommended by NCL for
nanoparticles’ cytotoxicity study.

DISCUSSION

form retains a functional HER2 kinase domain, and
its level is enhanced in nodal metastatic tissues and is
inversely correlated with disease free survival [31].
Another HER2 variant is delta16 HER2, which lacks exon
16 [6]. The absence of exon 16 exposes a cysteine residue,
which promotes receptor homodimerization and activation
[25]. The exogenous overexpression of delta16 HER2, but
not wild-type HER2, was sufficient to evoke an aggressive
breast cancer phenotype in the otherwise non-tumorigenic
MCF-10A mammary epithelial cell line [32]. Clinically,
delta16 HER2 expression was found in approximately

One major challenge today in treating HER2positive cancer is the intrinsic and acquired resistance
to HER2-targeted therapies. Studies to understand the
intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER2-targeted
therapies have implicated post-translational variants,
splicing variants, and mutations of HER2 as potential
mechanisms. One variant, p95-HER2, is a truncated form
of HER2 that lacks the extracellular domain thus rendering
it incapable of binding trastuzumab [30]. However, this

90% of HER2-positive breast cancer (data from 46
human HER2-positive BCs) and is highly correlated with
dissemination to local lymph nodes [25]. Delta16 HER2
has also been shown to activate entirely different signaling
pathways than wild-type HER2 [32, 33], which may alter
how cells respond to targeted therapies. A mutation in the
kinase domain of HER2 also has been reported in cells
[11] and in patient tissue samples [34], which may hinder
the binding of lapatinib making it ineffective at blocking
HER2 phosphorylation [11].
Other proteins have also been implicated in drug
resistance of HER2-positive cancer. For instance, Wang
et al. [12] reported that upregulation of estrogen receptors
was primarily responsible for the initial resistance to both
trastuzumab and lapatinib. However, in the later stage
of resistance, cancer cells once again became reliant
on HER2 signaling. Masking the HER2 receptor by a
membrane-associated glycoprotein, MUC4, has been
shown to prevent the binding of trastuzumab in HER2positive JIMT1 cells [35]. In addition, MUC4 [36] and
another family member MUC1-C [37], have also been
shown to maintain HER2 phosphorylation in MCF7/
HER2-18 (MCF7, engineered to overexpress HER2) and
in BT474R and SKBR3R (resistant to trastuzumab after
long term selection) cells, respectively. Lastly, increased
expression of HER2 receptor ligands that can stimulate
HER2 activation, has been reported in a BT474 cell line
with acquired resistance to lapatinib [12].
These mechanistic studies suggest that resistant
cancers still depend on HER2, while highlighting the
shortcomings of monoclonal antibodies and small
molecule inhibitors targeting HER2 in the resistant
cells. Herein, we show that RNA interference (RNAi) by
siRNA, which halts protein synthesis at the mRNA level,
can potentially overcome these shortcomings. Moreover,
siRNA can be designed to target mutated HER2 or HER2
variants if needed.
Our success in delivering effective doses of
siHER2d75 to treat intrinsically resistant HCC1954
tumors [19] prompted us to test it in a model of HER2positive cancer having acquired resistance to trastuzumab
(BT474-TR) and lapatinib (BT474-LR). For HER2 siRNA
screening in vitro, we used a non-specific commercial
transfection agent instead of our nanoparticle delivery
platform to avoid confounding siHER2 effects with
those of trastuzumab, which is used as the homing target
agent on our nanoparticles. Our resistant BT474-TR and
BT474-LR behaved similarly to those previously reported
by Wang et al. [12]; their growth was not fully inhibited
by exceedingly high doses of trastuzumab and lapatinib,
respectively. In contrast, siHER2d75 was effective in
inhibiting growth of both BT474-TR and BT474-LR cells.
The results translated well to the trastuzumab-resistant
BT474-TRgf tumor xenografts.
In our study, we showed that cancer treated longterm with siHER2d75 remained sensitive to the siHER2,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lapatinib and trastuzumab without significant changes in
the downstream phosphorylation patterns. This suggests
that HER2 signaling is still the preferred signaling
pathway and that the cells remained addicted to HER2mediated survival and proliferation. Cancer is less prone
to develop acquired resistance to siHER2d75 treatment
because it circumvents many resistance mechanisms
reported for small molecule inhibitors or antibodies.
Specifically, siHER2d75 decreases HER2 mRNA, and
therefore the cells are unable to synthesize more HER2
proteins to compensate for the loss of HER2 through
receptor recycling and degradation. Removing HER2 by
siHER2d75 can also negate resistance mechanisms relying
on the presence or stimulation of HER2 proteins as
aforementioned. In addition, siHER2d75 is not susceptible
to resistance caused by mutations in the kinase domain
or truncation of extracellular domain of HER2 that
could otherwise prevent the binding of trastuzumab and
lapatinib.
In all, our results suggest that siHER2d75 is a
promising alternative to current HER2-targeted therapies.
Moreover, HER2-positive tumors that have progressed
on trastuzumab or lapatinib are likely to remain treatable
with siRNA against HER2 while there is minimal risk of
developing further resistance to this RNAi strategy. Thus,
the clinical translation of HER2 siRNA to treat resistant
HER2-positive cancer is highly viable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and synthesis of HER2 siRNA
Seventy-six siRNA duplexes targeting the coding
region of human HER2 (NM_001005862) were designed,
each with 3’ UU overhangs and no other modifications.
Four negative control siRNAs were purchased from
commercial sources: 2 non-targeting siRNAs (AllStar
Negative Control siRNA from QIAGEN and ONTARGETplus™ Control Pool from Thermo Scientific
Dharmacon®), a Luciferase siRNA and a GFP siRNA. All
76 custom HER2 siRNAs were synthesized by QIAGEN.
A separate non-targeting siRNA, siSCR, was loaded onto
the nanoparticle for the in vivo study.

Cell culture and transfection of siRNA
The majority of cell lines used in this study were
obtained from ATCC and have not been re-authenticated
prior to use. JIMT1, EFM192A, EFM192B and EFM192C
were obtained from DSMZ. 21PT, 21NT, 21MT1
and 21MT2 were obtained from Dr. Kornelia Polyak
(Harvard Medical School). BT474-TRgf was obtained
from Drs. Robert Kerbel (University of Toronto) and
Giulio Francia (now at University of Texas at El Paso).
All media and supplements were purchased from Life
Technologies. The growth and medium conditions of

breast cancer cell lines have been previously published
[38]. Cells used in the cytotoxicity were cultured
according to ATCC guidelines. Transfection was carried
out using DharmaFECT-1 transfection reagent (Thermo
Scientific Dharmacon) diluted in OptiMEM medium
(Life Technologies). Cells were seeded 24 hours prior to
transfection using DharmaFECT-1 at a final dilution of
1:200. DharmaFECT-1 and HER2 siRNA were left in the
wells after transfection until assay completion.
For long-term transfection, a final concentration of
1 nM siHER2d75 was used throughout the 15-week period.
Cells were passaged such that they never exceed 75%
confluency. Transfection was repeated weekly. A second
set of cells were subjected to negative control siRNA
transfection under the exact same conditions. At the end
of the 15-week period, both populations were taken off
transfection and expanded for experiments.

of the 4 control siRNAs to determine the percentage of
HER2 knockdown.
RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of
wild-type and delta16 splice variants. Primers were
previously published [39] but the MGB quencher was
used instead of TAMRA on the probes. All primers and
probes were ordered from Applied Biosystems (Part of
Life Technologies). Total RNA was extracted and purified
using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). 50 ng of total RNA was
used in a one-step RT-PCR reaction ran on the ABI7500
Fast Thermocycler. Cycling conditions were 50 °C for 15
min, 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and
61 °C for 1 min. Data were analyzed using the delta CT
method by normalizing to GAPDH.

Establishment of acquired resistant BT474 cell
line derivatives

Cell viability was determined using the CellTiterGlo assay (Promega). Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates 24 h prior to transfection or drug treatment. Plates
were read 3 days after lapatinib treatment or 5 days after
trastuzumab treatment or siRNA transfection. Dose
response data points were calculated according to the
current NCI-60 DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Screen
protocol. Percent growth is calculated from this formula:

Cell viability assay, dose response plot and
calculation of GI values

To establish the trastuzumab-resistant BT474-TR,
parental BT474 cells were initially maintained in RPMI1640 complete medium with 10 μg/ml trastuzumab
(purchased from OHSU Pharmacy) for 1 month and then
the trastuzumab concentration was gradually increased
to 30 μg/ml over the next 5 months. To generate the
lapatinib-resistant BT474-LR, parental BT474 cells were
initially cultured in RPMI-1640 complete medium with 50
nM lapatinib (LC Laboratories, L-4804) for 1 month and
then the lapatinib concentration was gradually increased to
1 μM over the next 5 months. The BT474-TR cells were
then maintained in 30 μg/ml trastuzumab, while BT474LR in 1 μM lapatinib for subsequent studies. The resistant
cell derivatives were taken off trastuzumab or lapatinib 3
days prior to seeding for experiments.

Dose response curves were plotted and GI values
were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software).

Cytotoxicity of T-siHER2d75-NP
The cytotoxicity profile of T-siHER2d75-NP was
evaluated in four “normal/non-tumorigenic” cell lines,
HEK293, HEPG2, MCF10A, and HUVEC were purchased
from ATCC and grown in media as recommended by
the ATCC. The cells were seeded (cells/well in 96-well
plate) at 20,000 (HEK293), 250,000 (HEPG2), 120,000
(MCF10A), and 7,500 (HUVEC), respectively, for 24 h
to achieve about 80% confluency. The cells were then
treated with efficacious dose of T-siHER2d75-NP (60
nM as siHER2d75, 42 μg/mL as nanoparticle, [19]) or
acetaminophen (APAP, Tylenol) as a drug benchmark at
25 mM following the NCL’s protocol [29]. Cell viability
was measured at 24 h post-treatment with the CellTiterGlo assay, which measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
as an indicator of metabolically active cells, and reported
as percent of the untreated control’s viability.

Quantification of RNA expression
The mRNA levels of HER2 and actin control
were measured using QuantiGene® 2.0 Reagent System
(Affymatrix Panomics). Briefly, treated and control
samples were lysed 5 days after transfection. The lysates
were allowed to hybridize overnight with HER2 and actin
specific probes on the capture plate. Signal amplification
was achieved by further hybridization with Pre-Amplifier,
Amplifier and Labeled Probe. The Labeled Probe is
conjugated with alkaline phosphatases, which degrade
the chemiluminescent substrate added during the last step
to produce luminescence. Signals were detected on the
GloMax-Multi+ Detection System (Promega). The amount
of luminescence is directly proportional to the amount of
mRNA present in each sample. The HER2 mRNA levels
of treated and control samples were then normalized to
their respective actin mRNA levels. The normalized values
from treated samples were divided by the averages values

Targeted delivery of siHER2d75 in a mouse model
of HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft

Three days after transfection, cells were fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature and
then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X. After blocking for
one hour in 2% BSA, cells were stained overnight at 4°C
with primary antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation
was carried out at room temperature for one hour the next
day. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Life
Technologies). Plates were imaged on an Olympus IX81
Scan^R automated fluorescence microscope. Images were
analyzed, and signal intensities were quantitated using the
included analysis software package.

All animals were used under an approved protocol
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Oregon Health and Science University
(OHSU) and the experiments were carried out under the
auspices of the Department of Comparative Medicine
of OHSU. BT474-TRgf cells (1 x 107) were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of six-week-old athymic
nu/nu mice (Taconic) and allowed to grow to an average
size of ~100 mm3. Mice were then grouped and proceeded
to receive twice a week of siHER2d75 or siSCR loaded on
our mesoporous silica based nanoconstructs containing
trastuzumab (T-NP) for targeted delivery over a period
of six weeks via tail vein injection. Days of injection
and doses were specified in Figure 8B. Details on
the nanoconstruct design, composition, and synthesis
procedures can be found in our previous report [19].
Trastuzumab was administered intravenously twice
weekly at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg.

Western blot
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 hours prior to
transfection or drug treatment. Samples were harvested 48
hours after drug treatment and 72 hours after transfection.
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Running samples were
prepared with 4X Novex NuPAGE LDS sample buffer
(Life Technologies) and supplemented with 10% betamercaptoethanol. Twenty micrograms of protein were
loaded per lane of 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Life
Technologies) and ran in MOPS buffer. Proteins were
then transferred to PVDF-FL membrane (Millipore) in
Tris-Glycine transfer buffer. Primary antibody incubation
was carried out overnight at 4°C on a rocking platform.
Secondary antibody incubation was carried out at room
temperature the next day. Proteins were detected using the
LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences).
Image analysis and protein quantitation were performed
with ImageJ (NCI).
