Impact of Race on Biochemical Disease
Recurrence After Prostate Brachytherapy
Kosj Yamoah, MD, PhD1,2; Nelson Stone, MD1; and Richard Stock, MD1

BACKGROUND: Understanding racial differences in disease presentation and response to therapy is necessary for
the effective treatment and control of prostate cancer. In this study, the authors examined the influence of race on
biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) among men who received prostate brachytherapy. METHODS: In total, 2301
men were identified who had a minimum follow-up of 24 months and had received low-dose-rate brachytherapy for
prostate cancer at the Mount Sinai Medical Center from June 1990 to October 2008. Patient factors, with specific
emphasis on patient race, were analyzed with respect to freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF). Kaplan-Meier analyses, life-tables, and log-rank tests were used to identify variables that were predictive of 10-year FFbF. RESULTS: In
this series, a total of 2268 patients included 81% Caucasians, 12% African Americans, 6% Hispanics, and 1% Asians. The
10-year actuarial FFbF rate was 70% for AA men and 84% for all others (P ¼ .002). Between Caucasian men and AA
men, the 10-year FFbF rate was 83% versus 70%, respectively (P ¼ .001).There was no significant difference in 10-year
FFbF between Caucasian men and Hispanic men (83% vs 86%, respectively; P ¼ .6). The 10-year FFbF rate for Hispanic men and AA men was 86% versus 70%, respectively (P ¼ .062). A greater percentage of AA men presented
with higher prostate-specific antigen levels (PSA) (>10 ng/mL; 44% vs 21%; P < .001) and, thus, with higher risk disease (24% vs 15%; P < .001) compared with Caucasian men. Among the men with low-risk disease, the 10-year FFbF
rate was 90% for Caucasian men and 76% for AA men (P ¼ .041). The 10-year BDFS rate for patients who received
brachytherapy alone was 86% for Caucasian men and 61% for AA men (P ¼ .001); however, this difference was not
observed when brachytherapy was combined with androgen-deprivation therapy(ADT) with or without supplemental
external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Multivariate analysis revealed that PSA (P ¼ .024), Gleason score (P < .001), the
biologic effective dose (P < .001), EBRT (P ¼ .002), ADT (P ¼ .03), and AA race (P ¼ .037) were significant predictors
of 10-year FFbF. No significant differences was observed in overall survival, cause-specific survival, or distant metastasis-free survival between racial groups. CONCLUSIONS: AA race appeared to be an independent negative predictor
of BDFS after prostate brachytherapy, and this result may highlight the need for more aggressive therapy in this

Globally, it is known that black men experience the highest incidence and mortality from prostate cancer.1 Several
factors that contribute to this trend include inadequate access to health care, low socioeconomic factors, and race/ethnicity.2-4 Among these factors, race is the single most controversial and yet the least studied factor that impacts morbidity and
mortality in men with prostate cancer. It has been demonstrated that African American (AA) experience prostate cancer at
an earlier age compared with Caucasian men.5 Furthermore, AA men often present with higher tumor grade and disease
stage at the time of diagnosis.5-8 Much work done regarding the effect of race on biochemical disease recurrence after treatment has focused on radical prostatectomy (RP) and, to a lesser extent, external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).9-13 However,
results from those studies have proven inconclusive because of conflicting data, likely caused by differences in selection criteria and an inadequate sample size in the AA population. A relatively large study on results from the Shared Equal Access
Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database and the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) database revealed that, despite
favorable clinical or pathologic staging and low-risk disease at the time of diagnosis, AA men were at an increased risk of
biochemical disease recurrence after RP.14 Whether race acts as an independent prognostic factor for biochemical disease
recurrence in patients receiving radiotherapy is still under investigation. In this article, we examine the impact of race on
biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) in patients who received prostate brachytherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
In total, 2301 patients who had a minimum follow-up of
24 months and received low-dose-rate brachytherapy for
prostate cancer at the Mount Sinai Medical Center from
June 1990 to October 2008 were identified from our
database. Patient and treatment data were provided by a
prospectively collected database of 3000 men. Patients
had received brachytherapy with or without EBRT and/or
androgen-depravation therapy (ADT). Patients who had
radiologic or pathologic evidence of metastatic disease
before treatment were not included in this study. Thirtythree with unknown or unspecified ethnicity were
excluded from the data. The remaining 2268 patients
were subgrouped according to race/ethnicity as Caucasian, AA, Hispanic, or Asian. All patients were evaluated
initially by a thorough history and physical examination
(including digital rectal examination [DRE]) followed by
routine laboratory studies, including pelvic computed
tomography scans, bone scans, serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) levels, and Gleason score determined by
needle biopsy and reviewed at the Mount Sinai Medical
Center. All patients were staged according to the 1992
American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.15
Patients were stratified further into low, intermediate and
high risk groups according to the recent National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as
follows: Patients who had T1 to T2a tumors, and a Gleason score <7, and a PSA level <10 ng/mL were classified
as low risk; patients who had T2b to T2c tumors, and/or a
Gleason score of 7, and/or a PSA level between 10 ng/mL
and 20 ng/mL were classified as intermediate risk; and
patients who had >T3 tumors, or a Gleason score
between 8 and 10, or a PSA level >20 ng/mL were classified as high risk.16
Treatment
Different radiotherapy combinations are used to treat difference stages of disease. Seed implantation monotherapy
is used for low-risk prostate disease, whereas combination
therapy, which typically includes brachytherapy seed
implantation and/or EBRT with or without ADT, is
reserved for intermediate-risk to high-risk disease.
Brachytherapy Seed Implantation
All patients were seeded using the real-time transrectal
ultrasound-guided technique that was developed at Mount
Sinai in 1990. Iodine-125 (125I) seeds were received by
patients with low-risk disease (prescription dose, 160 grays

5590

[Gy]; calculated using the AAPM TG-43 dosimetry parameters), and palladium-103 (103Pd) seeds were received
by patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease.
Patients who had positive results on seminal vesicle biopsy
received supplemental EBRT, as described below.
Combination therapy began in 1994 with the
EBRT delivered using a 3-dimensional conformal techniques and 16-megavolt (MV) photons. The rectal, prostate, and seminal vesicle margins were 1.0 cm, 1.5 cm,
and 1.5 cm, respectively. The dose was prescribed to the
isodose line covering the planned target volume and was
delivered using 1.8-Gy fractions (25 days). In 2003,
image-guided radiotherapy was implemented using gold
fiducial markers, and the position of the prostate was
checked before each treatment using portal imaging with
anteroposterior and lateral films. Sixteen-MV photons
were used, and the margins were reduced to 8 mm for the
rectum and to 1 cm for all other margins. In 2005,
patients were treated on a stereotactic radiosurgery
machine with a 10  10 cm field size using 6-MV photons with image guidance provided by oblique kilovolt
x-rays before each treatment. Margins were reduced only
in the area of the rectum to 6 mm. Patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk status received treatment using
the same technique. For 103Pd monotherapy, the prescription dose was increased from 115 Gy to 124 Gy in 1998;
and, for partial 103Pd (combination) therapy, the dose was
increased from 85 Gy to 100 Gy.
Androgen-Deprivation Therapy
ADT consisted of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate) with or without antiandrogen (flutamide or bicalutamide). ADT
typically was given 3 months preimplantation and an
additional 2 or 3 months after seed implantation.17 However, when ADT was used as part of trimodality therapy
(ie, combined brachytherapy, EBRT, and ADT), hormone therapy was continued for an additional 6 months
after implantation, resulting in a total median ADT duration of 9 months (range, 6-28 months).18
Follow-Up and Treatment Endpoints
All patients were followed at least every 6 months, at
which time a complete evaluation, including DRE and serial PSA values, were determined and recorded. A Phoenix
failure (PSA nadir plus 2 ng/mL) or a rising PSA after
patients achieved their PSA nadir was an indication for
further workup, including a bone scan and prostate
biopsy. Treatment outcomes often correlate with

biochemical control rates; thus, Phoenix failure was used
to define biochemical failure, and freedom from biochemical failure (FFbF) was used as a surrogate for disease-free
survival.19
Statistical Analysis
Differences in the distribution of demographic, clinical,
pathologic, and risk stratification between the various
racial groups were evaluated using the Pearson chi-square
test and analyses of variance. The FFbF rate was determined on the basis of time to Phoenix failure using the
life-table method and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression analysis and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the
influence of race, age, clinical stage, PSA, Gleason score,
biologic effective dose (BED), EBRT, and ADT on biochemical disease recurrence. P values < .05 were considered as statistically significant. The analysis was done
using the IBM SPSS statistical software (version 19; SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, Ill).

men who were included in this series, 1831 men (81%)
were Caucasian, 270 men (12%) were AA, 141 men (6%)
were Hispanic, and 26 men (1%) were Asian. Age at presentation, initial PSA value, and clinical stage differed significantly among racial groups. Consistent with previous
reports,5-8,14,20,21 AA men presented at an earlier age
compared with Caucasian men (<60 years; 30% vs 22%;
P ¼ .021) and more often had PSA levels >10 ng/mL
compared with Caucasian men (44% vs 21%; P < .001).
In addition, more Caucasian men presented with PSA levels <4 ng/mL (11%) compared with AA men (3%).
Ninety-six percent of Asians in the study population presented with an initial PSA level <10 ng/mL. Hispanic
men had the lowest percentage of patients with T1 to T2a
tumors (54%) and the highest percentage with T2b to
T2c tumors compared with all the other ethnicities at the
time of diagnosis (43%; P ¼ .005for both). There was no
statistical difference in Gleason scores between study
groups.
The 10-year actuarial FFbF rate was 70% for AA
men and 84% for all others (Caucasians and Hispanics;
P ¼ .002), as indicated in Table 2. When Caucasian men
were compared with AA men, the 10-year actuarial FFbF
rate was 83% and 70%, respectively (P ¼ .001). Kaplan-

Meier survival plots also revealed a difference in 10-year
BDFS between Caucasian men and AA men (Fig. 1A)
(P < .001), but not between Caucasian men and
Hispanic men (Fig. 1B) (P ¼ .94). There was an observable difference in BDFS between AA men and Hispanic
men (Fig. 1C) (P ¼ .062); however, this difference
almost achieved statistical significance. The 10-year
overall survival (OS) rate was 80.5%, 79.5%, and 69.5%
for AA men, Caucasian men, and Hispanic men, respectively. The 10-year cause-specific survival (CSS) rate
between racial groups was 96% for AA men, 98% for
Caucasian men, and 100% for Hispanic men. There was
no statistically significant difference in OS or CSS
between racial groups (P ¼ .56 and P ¼ .67, respectively)
(Fig. 2A,B). An analysis of 10-year distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS) also indicated that there was no
significant difference between AA men (93%), Caucasian men (95%), and Hispanic men (96%; P ¼ .49)
(Fig. 2C).
Table 3 indicates that more Caucasian men presented with low-risk disease that AA men (49% vs 36%;
P < .001), whereas more AA men presented with highrisk disease (24% vs 15%; P < .001). Consequently, more
AA men received trimodality therapy compared with
Caucasian men (41% vs 27%; P < .001). A comparison
of the 10-year actuarial FFbF rate between Caucasian
men and AA men according to risk group revealed that
men with low-risk disease had rates of 90% versus 76%,
respectively (P ¼ .041), and men with intermediate-risk
disease had rates of 81% versus 73%, respectively
(P ¼ .069) (Table 4).There was no significant difference
in the 10-year FFbF rate for men with high-risk disease.

Among the patient characteristics that determine risk,
only Gleason score (P ¼ .002) and clinical tumor classification (P ¼ .001) contributed significantly to the
observed difference in FFbF between Caucasian men and
AA men (Table 5). Among patients who experienced biochemical failure within 10 years, a greater percentage of
AA men than Caucasian men had Gleason scores <7
(62% vs 48%; P < .001) and had clinical T1 to T2a
tumors (53% vs 46%; P < .001) (Table 5).
An analysis of treatment type and risk group in our
study population indicated that most men in the low-risk
group received seed implantation only with or without
ADT (97.5%), whereas most patients in the high-risk
group (81.3%) received trimodality therapy (Table 6).
We compared 10-year BDFS rates between Caucasian
men and AA men according to treatment type (Table 7).
It is noteworthy that there was a highly significant
difference in the 10-year BDFS rate between Caucasian
men and AA men who received seed implantation only
(86% vs 61%, respectively; P ¼ .001) (Fig. 3A). However,
this difference was not observed when seed implantation
was combined with either ADT, or EBRT, or both
(Fig. 3B-D).
We previously demonstrated that there is a positive
correlation between the biologic effective dose (BED) of
seed implants and FFbF. A higher BED was associated
with lower rates of biochemical failure and positive biopsies.22 Table 8 indicates that, among the patients who
received a BED 200, more AA men than Caucasian
men experienced biochemical failure in the low-risk group
(9.5% vs 5.8%; P ¼ .29) and the intermediate-risk group
(18.5% vs 7.4%; P ¼ .019). Consequently, there was an
observed difference in the 10-year FFbF rate between
Caucasian men and AA men who received a BED 200
compared with those who received a BED >200 for lowrisk disease (P ¼ .063) and intermediate-risk disease (P ¼
.036). This result suggests that AA men with low-risk to
intermediate-risk disease may require higher radiation
doses to improve biochemical disease control. There was
no significant difference in the biochemical failure rate
between Caucasian and AA men with high-risk disease,
likely because most patients in this risk group received trimodality therapy, thus masking the BED effect. Cox
regression analysis revealed that, after correcting for initial
PSA (P ¼ .024),Gleason score (P < .001), BED (P <
.001), EBRT (P ¼ .002), and ADT (P ¼ .03), AA race
(Exp[B]; odds ratio), 0.68; 95% confidence interval,
0.47-0.98; P ¼ .037) still remained a negative predictor
of FFbF (Table 9).

DISCUSSION
The influence of genetic predisposition, such as race/ethnicity, on prostate cancer in men before and after
treatment has been under intense scrutiny over the past
2 decades. However, whether race acts as an independent
prognostic factor for BDFS after radiotherapy
remains largely unclear. Consistent with previous
reports,5-8,14,20,21 our study indicated that AA men present at an earlier age and with higher initial PSA levels
compared with their Caucasian counterparts. However, in
our study population, there was no significant difference
in Gleason score or clinical stage between Caucasian men
and AA men at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, AA

men presented with higher risk disease compared with
Caucasian men (24% and 15%, respectively). Because risk
is determined by PSA, Gleason score, and tumor classification, it appears that the major contributing factor for this
difference is a higher initial PSA level among AA men.
In our study population, we observed that AA men
had a significantly lower 10-year BDFS rate compared
with Caucasian men (70% and 83%, respectively). We
also observed higher initial PSA levels (>20 ng/mL) in
our Hispanic population compared with Caucasians
(16% and 5%, respectively). This is consistent with the
results from a study by Rosser et al,9 who reported that
22% of Hispanics presented with a PSA level >20 ng/mL

contrary to the data reported by Rosser et al indicating a
marginally lower 5-year BDFS rate among Hispanic men
compared with Caucasian men (65% and 52%, respectively; P ¼ .077), our current results indicated no significant difference in the 10-year BDFS rate between
Caucasian men and Hispanic men.
To further explore the preponderance of lower 10year BDFS among AA men, we subdivided Caucasian
men and AA men according to risk groups based on the
new NCCN guidelines for risk group classification16 and
analyzed the 10-year actuarial FFbF. We observed that,
within the low-risk category, AA men demonstrated a significantly lower 10-year FFbF rate compared with Caucasian men (70% and 90%, respectively). Although our
demographic data indicated that more AA men presented
with higher risk disease as a result of higher initial PSA

levels, there was no difference in the 10-year FFbF rate
between Caucasian men and AA men with intermediaterisk and high-risk disease. It is noteworthy that, among
the factors identified in univariate analysis that determined risk (PSA, Gleason score, and tumor classification),
initial PSA was the only variable that did not have a significant impact on 10-year FFbF. Because of the finding
that, unlike PSA, Gleason score and tumor classification
often correlate with disease progression and severity, we
hypothesize that, based on our results, there may be differences in tumor characteristics and disease progression in
AA men with prostate cancer.
The recent treatment guidelines for patients with
low-risk prostate cancer who have a life expectancy >10
years recommend either RP, or definitive radiotherapy
(EBRT or brachytherapy), or active surveillance. Accordingly, most of our low-risk patients received brachytherapy seed implants alone (72%) or seed implants plus
ADT (25.5%). It is striking that the most significant difference we observed in BDFS (86% in Caucasian men
and 61% in AA men) occurred in the treatment group
that received seed implants only, and >95% of those men
were in the low-risk category. However, when ADT or
EBRT was added to seed implantation, there was no longer any significant difference in the rate of biochemical
disease recurrence between racial groups. Consistent with
previous reports indicating that the BED is correlated
with FFbF,18,22 we observed increased biochemical disease recurrence among patients who received a BED

This difference was more robust in AA men compared
with Caucasian men, suggesting that AA men may require
higher radiation doses to improve BDFS. Furthermore,
our multivariate Cox regression analysis identified AA
race as an independent negative predictor of FFbF. It is
noteworthy that the observed difference in biochemical
disease recurrence among the racial groups did not correlate directly with clinical endpoints like OS, CSS, or
DMFS rates. This is consistent with work done by Kupelian et al,23 who investigated the impact of biochemical
failure on OS rates during the first 10 years after definitive
radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Those authors
concluded that biochemical failure after definitive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer is not associated with
increased mortality within 10 years after initial therapy.
Furthermore, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) phase 3 randomized trials by Roach et al24
assessed the impact of race on survival in 2012 men who
received EBRT with or without ADT for localized prostate cancer. Results from that study indicated that black
race was associated with lower OS and disease-specific survival; however, after adjusting for risk group and treatment type, race no longer was associated with outcome. It
would be interesting to determine whether the increased
biochemical disease recurrence rate among AA men may
lead to more frequent salvage therapy in this patient
population.
There is conflicting evidence pertaining to a greater
risk of biochemical disease recurrence among AA men after RP. Nielsen et al13 investigated whether black race was
associated with poorer oncologic outcomes in a study
population that consisted of 4962 Caucasian men and
326 AA men who underwent RP between 1988 and 2004
at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Those authors reported
that AA men were likely to present with adverse preoperative clinical features at a younger age and had a higher
biochemical recurrence rate; however, in a multivariate

analysis, black race was not an independent predictor of
biochemical recurrence or adverse pathologic outcome.
Conversely, Hamilton et al10 evaluated racial differences
in pathologic features, time to disease recurrence, and
PSA doubling time among 953 Caucasian men and 659
black men in the SEARCH database who underwent RP
between 1988 and 2006. Those investigators reported
that, despite earlier clinical stage at presentation and similar pathologic characteristics, black men were at a slightly
increased risk of biochemical disease recurrence. Furthermore, Moreira et al14 evaluated whether race modified the
accuracy of nomograms to predict biochemical disease recurrence after RP among 1721 patients and 4511 patients
from the SEARCH and DPC databases, respectively.
They reported that, in both cohorts, AA men were more
likely to experience biochemical disease recurrence compared with Caucasian men.
Several studies that evaluated racial differences in biochemical disease recurrence among patients who received
radiotherapy also demonstrated equivocal results. Rosser et
al9 retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and
outcomes of 964 patients from various racial groups that
received EBRT for localized or locally advanced prostate
cancer, including 810 Caucasian men and 86 AA men.
Those authors observed that, when patients were stratified
according to known prognostic factors, the outcome for
both AA men and Caucasian men was comparable.
Another series by Sohayda et al25 analyzed outcomes after
prostatectomy or radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer
with respect to race in 2219 men between 1986 to 1998
(14% AA and 86% Caucasian). They demonstrated a statistically insignificant trend toward higher biochemical failure in AA men. Conversely, Thompson et al5 evaluated
outcomes of men with metastatic prostate disease in the
context of a randomized phase 3 trial (Southwest Oncology
Group Study 8894) that compared orchiectomy with or

5596

without flutamide in 288 AA men and 975 Caucasian men
who had metastatic prostate cancer. Those results indicated
that AA men were more likely to have extensive disease;
and, even after adjusting for initial quality-of-life assessment and pretreatment factors, AA men had a statistically
significantly worse prognosis than Caucasian men. Because
these studies included patients with different selection criteria, disease stages, and varied treatment modalities, a
comparison of treatment-dependent biochemical disease
recurrence among these study populations should be interpreted with caution. In 2002, Lee et al26 conducted a study
design very much identical to that presented by our group
in the current report. They compared PSA relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS) between 246 AA men and 835 Caucasian
men who received brachytherapy with or without EBRT
and/or ADT for clinically localized prostate cancer. In their
study, they concluded that race was not a predictor of 5year PSA-RFS among patients who were with or without
ADT within the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk
groups. However, a caveat to their study is that, unlike
other types of malignancy, prostate cancer has a relatively
slower rate of disease progression; therefore, a 5-year follow-up may be insufficient to adequately demonstrate a
racial effect on biochemical disease recurrence. Their data
also indicated that more AA men than Caucasian men
received ADT (41.5% vs 27.2%; P ¼ .01). This is consistent with results from our study indicating that the addition
of ADT (or EBRT) to brachytherapy eliminated the
observed difference in biochemical disease recurrence
(Fig. 3B), arguing in favor of more aggressive treatment for
AA men.
Results from our study suggest that racial differences
in genetic and/or physiologic factors may play a role in
prostate cancer disease characteristics, progression, and
treatment response. It has been demonstrated that several
genes involved in the androgen pathway exhibit racial

variations. AA men reportedly have a higher density of
androgen receptor protein expression in tissues from clinically localized prostate cancer.27 Other studies have indicated that AA men have distinct polymorphisms in the
androgen receptor classified as a greater percentage of
short CAG repeats, which may be associated with
increased androgen sensitivity at any given testosterone
hormone level.28,29 Furthermore, other groups have demonstrated racial differences in the gene cytochrome P450,
family 3, subfamily A polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4), which is

responsible for testosterone metabolism, and those differences reportedly lead to slower metabolism of testosterone
in AA men, resulting in a more sustained androgen signal.30 A study by Paris et al31 demonstrated that, among
black men with prostate cancer, 46% were homozygous
for the CYP3A4 gene variant compared with only 28% of
healthy black men (P < .005). Furthermore, those with
the variant allele tended toward higher grade and disease
stage, although the difference was not statistically significant. Zeigler-Johnson et al32 also reported that the

presence of both the CYP3A4 variant allele and the
CYP3A5 variant allele was associated with a higher probability of prostate cancer in AA men but not in Caucasian
men. Powell et al reported an association between the
CYP3A4 gene variant and disease-free survival among
Caucasian men and AA men.33 More recently Roach et
al34 determined whether racial variations in the CYP3A4
gene were correlated with the survival of men treated for
localized prostate cancer with EBRT with or without
ADT using patients from the RTOG 9202 phase 3

5598

randomized trial. Indeed, those authors observed a strong
association between race and the CYP3A4 polymorphisms, with 75% of Caucasian men possessing the
wild-type allele compared with only 25% of AA men
(P < .0001). However, after adjusting for risk group and
treatment type, Roach et al reported that CYP3A4 was no
longer associated with OS or biochemical disease progression. A limitation to their study was that, because of inadequate tissue samples, the data were underpowered to
detect differences in biochemical progression as a result of
the CYP3A4 gene polymorphism. In addition, the selection criteria for the RTOG 9202 trial were limited to
patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, most of
whom received combination therapy because of higher
risk disease. Consequently, the results obtained based on
this select patient population were in keeping with our
findings, which indicated that there was no difference in
biochemical disease recurrence between racial groups
in the intermediate-risk/high-risk disease category that
received combination therapy.
In conclusion, AA men in our patient population
presented with more intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer, mainly because of higher initial PSA levels.
We observed a difference in biochemical disease recurrence between AA men and Caucasian men, particularly
among those who were treated for low-risk prostate

cancer. Furthermore, AA race appeared to be an independent negative predictor of FFbF. Finally, among
patients who received brachytherapy alone, AA men experienced an increased incidence of biochemical disease recurrence. However, AA men who received more
aggressive treatment options achieved BDFS rates comparable to those of Caucasian men. Our findings suggest
that AA men are predisposed to a significantly greater risk
of biochemical failure, thus warranting more aggressive
therapy to achieve effective local control and to decrease
their rate of biochemical disease recurrence.
