BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate local control and patterns of failure in pediatric patients with low-grade
glioma (LGG) who received treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). METHODS: In total, 39 children received
IMRT after incomplete resection or disease progression. Three methods of target delineation were used. The first was to delineate the
gross tumor volume (GTV) and add a 1-cm margin to create the clinical target volume (CTV) (Method 1; n 5 19). The second was to
add a 0.5-cm margin around the GTV to create the CTV (Method 2; n 5 6). The prescribed dose to the GTV was the same as dose to
the CTV for both Methods 1 and 2 (median, 50.4 grays [Gy]). The final method was dose painting, in which a GTV was delineated
with a second target volume (2TV) created by adding 1 cm to the GTV (Method 3; n 5 14). Different doses were prescribed to the
GTV (median, 50.4 Gy) and the 2TV (median, 41.4 Gy). RESULTS: The 8-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 78.2%
and 93.7%, respectively. Seven failures occurred, all of which were local in the high-dose (95%) region of the IMRT field. On multivariate analysis, age 5 years at time of IMRT had a detrimental impact on progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT provided
local control rates comparable to those provided by 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional radiotherapy. Margins 1 cm added to the GTV
may not be necessary, because excellent local control was achieved by adding a 0.5-cm margin (Method 2) and by dose painting

INTRODUCTION
Neoplasms arising in the brain account for approximately 20% of all pediatric tumors. Low-grade glioma (LGG) is the
most common, with pilocytic astrocytoma comprising more than half of the cases. Other childhood LGGs also include
fibrillary astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, oligodendroglioma, pilomyxoid astrocytoma, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Despite the heterogeneity of LGG, the standard treatment approach is the same, with maximal safe resection as
first-line treatment; chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) are reserved for patients with incompletely resected tumors
and/or disease progression.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is currently used to treat many children with pediatric brain tumors.
The advantage of this technique includes limitation of high doses of radiation to the tumor and tumor bed while sparing
the surrounding normal tissue. Although there have been previous reports on IMRT for other pediatric brain tumors, to
our knowledge, there have been no reports using IMRT solely for LGG.1-3 Most reports in the last decade have used 3dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) with or without a stereotactic approach.4,5
With the advent of IMRT and other 3DCRT techniques, there has been controversy regarding what margins to use
for the clinical target volume (CTV). In different institutions, a margin ranging from 0 to 1 cm has been added to the gross
tumor volume (GTV) to create the CTV.4-6 The planning target volume (PTV) varied from 0.3 m to 1.0 cm in addition
to the CTV. In our institution, we have used 3 different target volumes for LGG secondary to physicians’ preference. The
most common method used was a 1-cm margin around the GTV to create the CTV. In some patients, a margin of 0.5 cm
was used instead of 1 cm to create the CTV. In both situations, the GTV, CTV, and PTV were prescribed the same RT
dose. Finally, in another subset of patients, a dose-painting approach was used. A 1-cm margin was added to the GTV;
however, the dose prescribed was different for the GTV and for the 1-cm margin around the GTV. The volume

encompassing 1 cm around the GTV received a dose
lower than the GTV. A PTV was not used for this final
approach, unlike the 2 other methods of target
delineation.
The main objective of this study was to determine
the 5-year and 8-year progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) of children with LGG who received
treatment with IMRT. A secondary goal was to investigate
the patterns of local failure to determine whether the margin used for treatment had an impact on PFS. Finally, we
wanted to determine which treatment parameters had an
impact on PFS and OS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1996 to 2012, 39 children with LGG received
IMRT in 1 radiotherapy department. There were 24 boys
and 15 girls, and the median patient age was 10 years
(range, 1-17 years) at the time of IMRT. None of the
patients had neurofibromatosis. The location of LGG was
central (optic pathway, thalamus, hypothalamus) in 19
patients (48.7%), posterior fossa (cerebellum, brainstem)
in 15 patients (38.5%), and hemispheric in 5 patients
(12.8%). Tumors were graded according to the World
Health Organization as grade 1 in 32 patients (82%) and
grade 2 in 7 patients (18%). The types of LGG included
pilocytic astrocytoma in 26 patients (66.7%), ganglioglioma in 6 patients (15.4%), fibrillary astrocytoma in 4
patients (10.3%), pilomyxoid astrocytoma in 1 patient
(2.6%), oligodendroglioma in 1 patient (2.6%), and
mixed oligoastrocytoma in 1 patient (2.6%). The median
GTV was 21.7 mL (range, 4.3-195.6 mL).
IMRT was delivered within 4 to 6 weeks after subtotal resection in 19 patients (48.7%). In 20 patients,
IMRT was received at the time of progression after resection alone in 10 patients (25.6%) and after chemotherapy
in 10 patients (25.6%). Only children aged <10 years
received chemotherapy, and the objective was to delay RT
and minimize neurocognitive impairment. The most
common chemotherapy regimen was carboplatin and vincristine in 9 of 10 patients. Two patients received a second
chemotherapy regimen before IMRT. The median time
to progression after chemotherapy was 2.1 years (range,
0.3-8 years). IMRT was delivered using serial tomotherapy in 19 patients (48.7%) and step-and-shoot or
dynamic IMRT in 20 patients (51.3%). The technique
for IMRT delivery has been described previously in other
reports from our institution for children with medulloblastoma and ependymoma.1,3
Target delineation was performed using fused magnetic resonance images. For pilocytic astrocytomas, the

Figure 1. Three methods of target delineation are illustrated
for pediatric low-grade glioma. GTV indicates gross tumor
volume; CTV, clinical target volume; PTV, planning target volume; 2TV, secondary target volume used for dose painting.

GTV was the entire tumor volume, including the cyst
observed on a gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequence and any
nonenhancing abnormality observed on a T2 or fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. For children with diffuse gliomas, the GTV was delineated using
the T2 or FLAIR sequence. Three methods of target
delineation were used during the study period (Fig. 1).
The method of target delineation was determined by
physician preference. During the era studied, 3 radiation
oncologists treated children with pediatric brain tumors.
The most common method in 19 patients (48.7%) was to
delineate the GTV and add a 1-cm margin to create the
CTV (Method 1). Another method used in 6 children
(15.4%) was to delineate the GTV and add a 0.5-cm margin to create the CTV (Method 2). In both Methods 1
and 2, a 0.3-cm margin was added to the CTV to create
the PTV. The prescribed dose to the GTV was the same as
the prescribed dose to the CTV and the PTV. The median
prescribed dose to the GTV, CTV, and PTV was 50.4
grays (Gy) (range, 45-60 Gy). One patient who had a
fibrillary astrocytoma with a high proliferation index
received a dose of 60 Gy. The other method, which was
used in 14 patients (35.9%), was dose painting (Method
3). In this method, a GTV was delineated. A second target
volume (2TV) was defined by adding 1 cm to the GTV. A
PTV was not contoured, because the daily set-up error
was built into the 2TV. Two different doses were prescribed to the GTV and the 2TV. The median prescribed
dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-54 Gy) to the GTV and 41.4
Gy (range, 40-45 Gy) to the 2TV. Patient, tumor, and
treatment characteristics according to the method of
target delineation are listed in Table 1. The Fisher exact
test was used to determine differences in patient, tumor,

dose (5040 cGy vs >5040 cGy), and treatment era
(1996-2001 vs 2002-2012). Both OS and PFS were calculated from the time of IMRT completion. Kaplan-Meier
analysis was performed for estimates of survival. The
log-rank test was used to compare survival according to
different host, tumor, and treatment characteristics.
Finally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to determine which parameters were significant on multivariate
analysis. The median follow-up for all patients was 81
months (range, 7-177 months).

The 5-year and 8-year PFS rate was 78.2% (Fig. 2a). On
univariate analysis, the only parameters that were significant for PFS were age at the time of IMRT, receipt of
chemotherapy before IMRT, and method of target delineation (Table 2). The 5-year and 8-year PFS rate for children aged 5 years and >5 years at the time of IMRT was
55% and 90.6%, respectively (P 5 .02). The 5-year and
8-year PFS rate for children who did and did not receive
prior chemotherapy was 50% and 88.4%, respectively
(P 5 .03). The 5-year and 8-year PFS rate for children
who received treatment using Methods 1, 2, and 3 for
target delineation was 57.4%, 100%, and 92.3%, respectively (P 5 .05). On multivariate analysis, only age at time
of RT was significant for PFS, with more disease progression observed among patients who were aged 5 years at
the time of IMRT (P 5 .024).
Patterns of Failure

and treatment characteristics according to the target delineation method. More grade 2 tumors were treated using
Method 3 (P 5 .017), whereas step-and-shoot or dynamic
IMRT was the only technique used for children who were
treated using Method 2 (P 5 .034).
The patterns of failure were documented as local,
marginal, or distant.7 Local recurrence was defined as
>95% of the recurrence volume receiving >95% of the
prescribed dose. Marginal recurrence was defined as 20%
to 95% of the recurrence volume receiving >95% of the
prescribed dose. Distant recurrence was defined as <20%
of the recurrence volume receiving >95% of the prescribed dose.
The following parameters were evaluated with
respect to their impact on OS and PFS: sex, age at time of
IMRT (5 years vs >5 years), tumor grade, tumor location (central, hemispheric, or posterior fossa), GTV (<50
mL vs 50 mL), receipt of chemotherapy before IMRT,
target delineation method, type of IMRT delivery, total
2656

Seven patients (17.9%) progressed at a median of 37
months (range, 4-60 months) after IMRT. All failures
were in-field failures, and there were no marginal or distant failures. A girl aged 9 years who had a grade 2 fibrillary astrocytoma of the thalamus on biopsy received 60
Gy in 30 fractions secondary to a high proliferation index.
Her tumor progressed 4 months after IMRT and, on
rebiopsy, was identified as a malignant glioma.
Overall Survival and Late Effects

The 5-year and 10-year OS rate was 93.7% (Fig. 2b).
None of the parameters examined were prognostic for OS
(Table 2). One patient who was aged 4.5 years at the time
of IMRT for a suprasellar pilocytic astrocytoma developed
Moyamoya disease. Twenty-one children had endocrine
follow-up, including 12 children with had centrally
located tumors, 3 with hemispheric tumors, and 6 with
posterior fossa tumors. Ten of 21 patients who had endocrine follow-up had hormone abnormalities, including 3

children with panhypopituitarism, 3 with 1 hormone
deficiency, and 4 with 2 hormone deficiencies. Children
who had centrally located tumors were more likely to have
endocrine abnormalities compared with those who had
hemispheric and posterior fossa tumors (P 5 .008). Nine
of the 10 patients who had documented hormone deficiencies had tumors located either in the suprasellar, optic
pathway, or hypothalamic region. There was no blindness
secondary to IMRT. At last follow-up, 4 of the 15 patients
who were aged 18 years were in college. Of the 39
patients who received IMRT, only 1 was receiving special
education. None of the patients developed a radiationinduced tumor.
DISCUSSION
The 5-year and 8-year PFS rate for pediatric patients with
LGG who received IMRT in this study was 78.2%. This
compares favorably with previous published reports. In
the Hirntumorstudien LGG 1996 protocol, the 10-year
PFS rate was 62% for patients who received RT.8 In the
current study, safety margins of 1 cm and 2 cm were
added when magnetic resonance imaging and computed
tomography scans were used, respectively. At St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital, the 5-year and 10-year PFS
rates were 87.4% and 74.3%, respectively, with the use of
conformal RT using a 1-cm margin for the CTV.4 At the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute, the 5-year and 8-year PFS
rates were 82.5% and 65%, respectively, using stereotactic
RT. In the Boston study, the GTV and CTV were the
Cancer

same; a 2-mm margin was added to the CTV to create the
PTV. In all of those reports, the OS rates at 8 to 10 years
range from 82% to 96%, similar to the 8-year OS rate in
the current report of 93.7%.
The question regarding the size of margins around
the GTV to create the CTV is controversial and varies in
different studies, as discussed above. In the recently completed Children’s Oncology Group protocol ACNS0221,
a margin of 0.5 cm was added to the GTV to create the
CTV, and another 3 to 5 mm can be added to the CTV to
create the PTV, depending on institutional experience.
The results from that multi-institutional, prospective trial
have not been reported. Although the univariate analysis
in our current study suggests that the method of target
delineation possibly contributed to disease progression, a
further review of failures indicated that 5 of the 7 relapses
occurred in children who received IMRT at age 5 years.
This suggests that younger age rather than the method of
target delineation was the primary predictor of disease
progression. Our multivariate analysis indeed revealed no
difference in progression according to the method of
target delineation, and only age <5 years at the time of
irradiation was associated with worse PFS, consistent with
findings reported from other studies.9,10 Our findings
suggest that 1-cm margins around the GTV may not be
necessary for CTV delineation in pediatric LGG.
In this report, 14 patients were treated using
Method 3, which involved dose painting. Dose painting
has been used in other pediatric tumors, such as

ependymoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.3,11 The main
advantage of this approach compared with a sequential
boost approach is the lower fractional dose to surrounding
normal tissue.11 This method of using a lower fraction
size to surrounding normal tissue around the GTV may
reduce late toxicity and allow for the possibility of dose
escalation in selected tumors. We observed only 1 local
failure among 14 patients who received treatment using
this approach in our institution.
This report of 39 children who received IMRT for
LGG compares favorably with previous published reports
that used 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional, conformal
techniques.4-6,8,9 Although our report indicates that the
efficacy of treatment is not compromised by using
IMRT, the main reason for using IMRT in children is to
reduce the high-dose RT volume to the surrounding normal tissues, which is expected to translate into a reduc2658

tion in late effects. Although this was not a prospective
study, the late toxicities described in our report appear to
be comparable to those in other reports using conformal
techniques. Of 21 patients who had endocrine data available, 10 (47.6%) developed endocrine deficiency. Endocrine data were available for 12 of 19 patients (63.2%)
with centrally located tumors, for 3 of 5 patients (60%)
with hemispheric tumors, and for 6 of 14 patients
(42.9%) with posterior fossa tumors. It is possible that
some patients who did not have endocrine follow-up did
not have symptoms related to hormone loss, which usually would prompt endocrine testing and consultation. It
is important to note that most of the endocrine abnormalities were observed in the patients who had centrally
located tumors. It is possible that some of these patients
had endocrine abnormalities before IMRT. In the study
by Merchant et al, 24% and 12% of patients before conformal RT had growth hormone and precocious puberty,
respectively.12 In the same report, 48.9%, 64%, 19.2%,
and 34.2% required growth, thyroid, glucocorticoid, and
gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy, respectively. Other reports of endocrine deficiency in the
2-dimensional era have demonstrated that 79% to 100%
of long-term survivors have hormone deficits.13,14 Vasculopathy was observed in only 1 patient aged <5 years
who received treatment for a suprasellar pilocytic astrocytoma. This is consistent with a recent literature review in
which Moyamoya disease was identified as most common in young patients (<5 years) who received treatment for a hypothalamic or suprasellar tumor.15
One of the main concerns about using IMRT in children is the amount of radiation leakage to the rest of the
body secondary to the number of monitor units necessary
to deliver the treatment. Some have speculated that there
may be an increase in radiation-induced cancers from 1%
to 1.75% at 10 years because of IMRT.16 This requires
long-term follow-up in a large number of patients to determine the difference. We did not observe any radiationinduced secondary tumors in our study; and, to our knowledge, there have been no published reports to date with
clinical experience demonstrating that IMRT is associated
with a higher risk of radiation-induced secondary tumors.
This study had limitations secondary to its retrospective nature. The choice of target delineation method
was secondary to the treating radiation oncologist at a
specified period. Not all data were available for the study
of late complications. Despite this limitation, our study
indicates that IMRT is an excellent treatment for incompletely resected and recurrent pediatric LGG, and the PFS
and OS outcomes are comparable to what is reported in
Cancer

the available literature. Young age at time of IMRT was
identified as a detrimental factor for PFS. The current
report also suggests that margins 1 cm may not be necessary when designing the CTV for these patients. IMRT
with dose painting is a reasonable RT option for these
patients to reduce the fractional dose to surrounding normal tissues. We await the results of the Children’s Oncology Group protocol ACNS0221 to validate our results.
