ABSTRACT
Different chemotherapy drugs are generally introduced in clinical practices
combining with therapy for glioma treatment. However, these chemotherapy drugs
have rarely been compared with each other and the optimum drug still remains to be
proved. In this research, medical databases were consulted, PubMed, Embase and
Cochrane Library included. As primary outcomes, hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with their corresponding 95% credential
intervals (CrI) were reported. A network meta-analysis was conducted; the surface
under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was utilized for treatment rank and
a cluster analysis based on SUCRA values was performed. This research includes
14 trials with 3,681 subjects and eight interventions. In terms of network metaanalysis, placebo was proved to be inferior to the combination of temozolomide (TMZ),
nimustine (ACNU) and cisplatin (CDDP). Also, bevacizumab (BEV) in conjunction
with TMZ were significantly more effective than placebo with an HR of 0.40. The
estimated probabilities from SUCRA verified the above outcomes, confirming that
the combination of TMZ, ACNU and CDDP exhibited the highest ranking probability
of 0.889 with respect to OS, while BEV in combination with TMZ - with a probability
of 0.772 - ranked the first place with respect to PFS. According to the results of this
network meta-analysis, the combination of (1) TMZ, ACNU and CDDP; (2) BEV in
combination with TMZ and (3) cilengitide in combination with TMZ, are considered
as the preferable choices of chemotherapy drugs for glioma treatment.

INTRODUCTION

can be further classified into four stages on the basis of
their histopathological patterns, the presence of nuclear
pleomorphism, the degree of increased mitotic activity and
cellularity, endothelial cell proliferation and the degree of
necrosis [4]. In stage I and II, gliomas are considered as
low-risk cases in which more optimistic prognosis are
usually observed whereas gliomas in stage III and IV are
classified as high-risk cases and referred to as malignant
tumours. For instance, anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) and

Glioma tumours developed from neoplastic glial
cells - which provide support and protection for the
peripheral and central nerve system [1] are a common type
of primary brain tumours. This specific type of tumour
accounts for approximately 30% of all brain and spine
tumours and 80% of all malignant brain tumours [2]. As
suggested by World Health Organization (WHO), gliomas

glioblastomas (GB) are common types of stage III and IV
glioma cases, and the five-year survival rate of GB patients
is less than 3% [5]. Another key factor for the prognosis
of glioma patients is the onset age and a large number
of studies have concluded that the average survival time
of GB patients was negatively correlated to their ages at
which GB was diagnosed [6].
Surgery, radiation therapy (RT) or chemotherapy is
introduced when oncology is certified. Surgical approaches
usually involve biopsy and resection for which the extent
and timing are essential factors for prognosis. Numerous
studies have indicated that the extensive or gross total
surgery is correlated with a less recurrent incidence and
longer survival time compared with the approach of
limited surgery [7-9].. RT is usually conducted for HGG
patients once surgeries had been introduced to these
patients and it is also appropriate for some patients who
are not eligible for surgeries. Local RT, three-dimensional
conformal RT and stereotactic radiosurgery are three
popular RT techniques introduced in clinical practices.
Apart from that, brachytherapy, radiosurgery and hyper
fractionation have been introduced in order to improve
remedial outcomes [11]. For instance, temozolomide
(TMZ), a DNA alkylating agent, has been introduced into
RT and this approach doubled the two-year survival rate to
approximately 27% compared to single RT [12].
Furthermore, anti-tumour alkylating agents
including carmustine (BCNU), nimustine (ACNU),
lomustine (CCNU) and other nitrosourea agents also
play important roles in glioma treatment. For recurrent
GB, biological agents and monoclonal antibodies such
as bevacizumab (BEV) are highly recommended in
clinical practices [12]. Since single chemotherapy agent
was limited in its effectiveness for suppressing tumour
cells, two or more chemotherapy agents with synergistic

effects have been introduced. Procarbazine, lomustine as
well as vincristine (PCV) can be considered as commom
choices. Although RT in conjunction with chemotherapy
has enhanced the effectiveness of treatment, it is still
challenging to determine the optimal combination of
treatments due to the wide range of available interventions.
There are a large amount of studies comparing the
prognosis of patients who had been treated with mono
or combined anti-glioma drugs. However, the majority
of evidence was generated by pair-wise meta-analyses
in which only head-to-head trails were compared. Some
results appeared to be biased due to the lack of study
subjects. Others appeared to have contradictory results
which were misleading in the current literature. This search
enabled us to compared the overall survival (OS) and
progression-freesurvival (PFS) status of glioma patients
who had been treated with: (1) TMZ, (2) PCV, (3) BEV
combined with TMZ, (4) Nimotuzumab, (5) Cilengitide
combined with TMZ, (6) TMZ combined with ACNU and
cisplatin (CDDP), (7) dibromodulcitol (DBD) combined
with BCNU and (8) alpha-difluoromethylornithine
(DMFO) combined with PCV.

RESULTS
Included studies
Fourteen eligible trials including 3,681 subjects were
selected from 51 studies assessed in this meta-analysis
[19-32]. Initially, 1,647 publications were identified by
keywords searching in three mentioned medical databases
and 41 of them are meta-analysis. Another 69 metaanalyses were found and included through reviewing

studies were selected with 37 of the 51 studies excluded

loop. This resulted in the inclusion of 14 scientific papers
that were published between 2000 and 2015. The entire
process of literature search is illustrated in Figure 1. These
14 papers mentioned eight distinctive chemotherapy drugs
that can be used for glioma: (1) TMZ, (2) PCV, (3) BEV in
combination with TMZ, (4) Nimotuzumab, (5) Cilengitide
in combination with TMZ, (6) TMZ combined with
ACNU and CDDP, (7) DBD in combination with BCNU,

half of the 14 studies disclosed that whether glioma were
newly formed cases whereas the other half of the studies
failed to report this issue. All included patients have
undergone radio therapeutic treatment and surgery. The
entire network of comparisons among all eligible studies
is demonstrated in Figure 2.

Direct comparison
The results of pair-wise comparisons were illustrated
in Table 2. There appeared to be no significant difference
in OS status between patients treated with placebo and
those treated by TMZ, PCV, Nimotuzumab or DBD in
conjunction with BCNU (HR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.56-1.11;
HR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.65-1.02; HR = 0.68, 95%CI =
0.42-1.11; HR = 0.77, 95%CI = 0.56-1.06). Also, there
was no significant difference in OS status between patients
treated with TMZ and those treated with BEV + TMZ,
Cilengitide + TMZ or ACNU + CDDP +TMZ (HR = 0.88,
95%CI = 0.59-1.26; HR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.58-1.26; HR =
0.52, 95%CI = 0.24-1.12). Similarly, introducing DMFO
into PCV did not improve the effectiveness of PCV
significantly (HR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.91-1.11).
Comparisons of PFS among different interventions
were also listed in Table 2. PCV seemed to be the only

as the most effective one with respect to PFS. As a result,
we performed a cluster analysis in order to simultaneously
assess OS and PFS (Figure 6) and the corresponding
treatments were categorized into three distinct clusters.
The green cluster including BEV + TMZ, cilengitide +
TMZ and TMZ + ACNU + CDDP appeared to have the
most desirable OS and PFS whereas the blue cluster
including nimotuzumab, TMZ and placebo seemed to be
the least effective ones.

from Nimotuzumab and TMZ + ACNU + CDDP, all other
interventions were more effective than the placebo with
respect to PFS of glioma patients. The corresponding
HR values were listed as follows: TMZ with HR of 0.63
and 95%CrI of 0.54 to 0.73, PCV with HR of 0.65 and
95%CrI of0.53 to 0.80, BEV + TMZ with HR of 0.40 and
95%CrI of 0.32 to 0.50, cilengitide + TMZ with HR 0.57
and 95%CrI of 0.45 to 0.71, DBD + BCNU with HR of
0.75 and 95%CrI of 0.57 to 0.98 and DMFO + PCV with
HR of 0.65 and 95%CrI of 0.52 to 0.82. Also, introducing
BEV into TMZ significantly improved the PFS of glioma
patients (HR = 0.64, 95%CrI = 0.55-0.75) and PCV
remarkably improved the PFS of glioma patients (HR =
0.62, 95%CrI = 0.46 to 0.84). By contrast, nimotuzumab,
cilengitide + TMZ, DBD + BCNU and DMFO + PCV
appeared to be less effective than BEV + TMZ and the
corresponding HR for the above comparisons were: 1.86,
95%CrI = 1.15-3.02; 1.41, 95%CrI = 1.12-1.77; 1.86,
95%CrI = 1.31-2.64; and 1.62, 95%CrI = 1.18-2.23.
The estimated ranking probabilities of each
intervention calculated through SUCRA were illustrated
in Figure 5. As suggested by the corresponding SUCRA,
the intervention of TMZ + ACNU + CDDP was ranked as
the most effective treatment combination with respect to
OS whereas the intervention of BEV + TMZ was ranked

DISCUSSION
In this multiple treatment Bayesian meta-analysis,
eight chemotherapy interventions in combination with
RT after surgery were tested in this research. A total of
3,681 patients suffering from glioma were involved
in this research and these patients were obtained from
14 randomized control trials or clinical trials. Also
direct together with indirect evidence were taken into
consideration in order to complete the conventional metaanalysis. The aim of this analysis was to examine the
optimal chemotherapeutic treatment for glioma and to
provide confidential guidance for clinical practice through
assessing and comparing the prognosis of patients.

As suggested by the rank probabilities of SUCRA,
the combination of TMZ, ACNU and CDDP exhibited
the most desirable OS. Another study conducted by Kim
et al. [20] has identified the superiority of introducing
both ACNU and CDDP into TMZ compared with single
TMZ. Although TMZ, ACNU and CDDP were classified
as alkylating agents, they had different mechanisms to
control tumour cells. For instance, TMZ was converted
into 5-(3-methyl)-1-triazen-1-yl-imidazole-4-carboximide
(MTIC) through hydrolysis which provides affinity
for guanine residues and induces either alkylation
or methylation that further triggers apoptosis [33].
By contrast, ACNU is considered as the second-line
chemotherapeutic intervention for glioma patients since it
has comparable permeability for overcoming the bloodbrain barriers. However, ACNU functions through the
formation of DNA monoalkylated adducts which may lead
to spontaneous depuration, single-strand breaks or alkalilabile sites [34]. Although ACNU was prone to guanine
residues , it is able to inhibit DNA synthesis by crosslinks [35]. However, damage caused by both TMZ and

ACNU, especially the methylated product at O-6 position
O6-methylguanine (O6MeG), can be restored by the DNA
repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) [36-38]. The presence of the MGMT enzyme
prevented the apoptosis of tumour cells and suppressed
the progression of both TMZ and ACNU [39]. On the
other hand, CDDP can form multiple DNA adducts [40].
Unfortunately, this type of intervention is associated with
several adverse effects. For instance, long term or high
dosage of CDDP may induce cisplatin-resistant disease
[41, 42] and it is acknowledged that CDDP has serious
toxic effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity on
patients [43]. Therefore, the combination of TMZ, ACNU
and CDDP not only reduced their side effects on patients
but also improved the prognosis of patients.
Unlike ACNU and CDDP, BEV is a humanized
monoclonal antibody and it is the first angiogenesis
inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). BEV is an antibody to VEGF-A, a predominant
member of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
family, which is highly expressed in tumour cells under

hypoxia and could stimulate endothelial cell proliferation
[44, 45]. Micro vessels regression, vessel growth and
neovascularization inhibition can be achieved by antiVEGF treatment. Since vascular proliferation was one
of the pathological hallmarks of GBM, continuous BEV
is important in glioma treatment due to its inhibition of
angiogenesis [46]. Nevertheless, single BEV in clinical
practices has not been confirmed by researches due to
its poor penetration through blood-brain barriers. As
suggested by some hypothesises, BEV may cross the
blood-brain barrier and reach its target if other drugs with
strong permeability such as TMZ were introduced and this
may explain the excellent performance of BEV combined
with TMZ [47].
This Bayesian network meta-analysis evaluates
eight popular chemotherapy interventions that were
incorporated into RT for managing glioma patients in
clinical practices. The OS and PFS of glioma patients
were compared through synthesizing both direct and
indirect evidence in order to overcome issues such as
small sample size and lack of head-to-head comparisons.
Nevertheless, some limitations should not be neglected
due to the nature of network meta-analysis. For instance,

some chemotherapeutic interventions were intentionally
excluded so that a closed loop of interventions can be
formed for network meta-analysis. Besides that, five
out of eight interventions-BEV + TMZ, nimotuzumab,
TMZ + ACNU + CDDP, DBD + BCNU, DMFO + PCVontained only one eligible study and such a trend could
have significant influence on the overall conclusions.
Furthermore, factors such as different strategies of RT
and the extent of surgery in each study were completely
ignored and it is likely that the overall effectiveness
of these chemotherapeutic may vary with the above
mentioned confounding factors. Finally, our study did not
take the modality of glioma into account and such an issue
should be investigated by future researchers.
This study provided exclusive evidence that some
chemotherapeutic agents including ACNU, CDDP or
BEV can be introduced into TMZ in order to enhance its
efficacy and hence improve the survival status of glioma
patients. However, clinicians should be attentive to the
characteristics of patients as well as the contraindications
of chemotherapeutic interventions when selecting the most
appropriate one for glioma patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

evaluated using outcomes including median OS time, HR
of OS, median time of PFS, HR of PFS as well as the
number of adverse events occurred in each group.
Network meta-analysis (NMA) has been designed
to compare the prognosis of glioma patients treated by
different chemotherapeutic agents and primary endpoints
incorporated in NMA were the OS and PFS for which
the median value as well as the HR were compared. As
defined by the National Cancer Institute (NIH), the OS
time is the time between treatment commencements and
patient death. OS is considered as a standard primary
endpoint which is easy and precise to assess the overall
effectiveness of interventions in oncologic clinical trials
[14]. On the other hand, PFS is defined between the time at
which disease was not progressed and the time of patient
death. Both OS and PFS provide comprehensive evidence
for the effectiveness of a specific chemotherapy. For those
studies in which data of OS or PFS were not presented,
we estimated these figures either using the cumulative
survival percentages or the available survival curves.

Search strategy
Medical databases including PubMed, Embase and
Cochrane Library were consulted to identify all eligible
randomized control trials that were not restricted by
particular languages. The following searching terms with
their corresponding synonyms were used to find relevant
literatures: “glioma”, “radiotherapeutic treatment”,
“surgery”, “chemotherapeutic agents”, “clinical trial”
and “randomized control trial”. The reference list of
every article was examined manually in order to prevent
relevant articles being excluded and two reviewers (Ling
Qi and Lijuan Ding) retrieved all the potential literature
independently.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Statistical analysis

Studies were eligible if they satisfied the following
criteria: (i) they were randomized control trials, or clinical
trials in phase II or III with more than 30 subjects; (ii) all
the subjects were adults who were diagnosed with glioma,
irrespective of different glioma types or grades; (iii) all
chemotherapy drugs which were studied must be used
with RT after surgery, although there was no restriction on
the type of RT or the scope of surgery; (iv) studies must
investigate the OS and PFS of glioma patients treated with
at least two chemotherapeutic treatments or placebos.
Additionally, even though the criteria above were met,
studies were eliminated if they satisfied any exclusion
criteria: (i) examined only one chemotherapy drug for
which different delivery methods were compared such as
intravenous and intra-arterial administration [13]; (ii) the
reported interventions were not within a closed loop since
indirect comparisons between two interventions cannot
be established by linking them with a third intervention.
The title and abstract of all the retrieved literatures were
screened, and full text was also examined for the sake
of determining the eligibility of studies. Two reviewers
(Ling Qi and Lijuan Ding) performed all the above
procedures independently and disagreement was resolved
by discussion.

We set the significance level at α = 0.05 for all
statistical tests. Heterogeneity between studies were
assessed by the Cochran’s Q statistic which calculates the
weighted sum of squared differences [15] as:

The proportion of the observed variance contributed
by real differences in effect sizes rather than sampling
errors was measured by the statistic of I2 [16]:
In this case, the random-effects model was more
appropriate than the fixed-effect model [17]. Subsequently,
a NMA was conducted for both OS and PFS based on a
Bayesian framework using R 3.2.3 software. Both direct
and indirect evidence were synthesized in the NMA and
the results were described as ORs with their corresponding
95% credible intervals. Furthermore, the surface under
the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was adopted to
identify the optimal interventions with respect to different
endpoints. The probabilities that each intervention ranks
the best, second best and third best etc., were calculated
in percentages and then these numerical values were
accumulated in order to obtain their corresponding
SUCRA values. All the investigated treatments were
ranked based on their corresponding SUCRA values and
a higher value of SUCRA provided evidence for more
desirable OS and PFS time [18]. In addition, a cluster
analysis was performed to group similar interventions by
combining different endpoints.

Outcome measures and data extraction
For each eligible study, the following information
was extracted: the main characteristics of the study
including author; year of publication; country; type of
study; sample size; baseline characteristics of patients
such as glioma modality, newly or recurrent glioma, extent
of surgery, type of RT, intervention details such as delivery
methods and doses. Apart from these, interventions were
