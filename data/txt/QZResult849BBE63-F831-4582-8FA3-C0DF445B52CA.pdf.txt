BACKGROUND: Data regarding the role of anthracyclines and taxanes as first-line treatments of metastatic angiosarcoma are limited. METHODS: Records of 117 metastatic angiosarcoma patients who were treated with either doxorubicin or weekly paclitaxel were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients (64%) were treated with weekly paclitaxel
and 42 (36%) with single-agent doxorubicin. Patients in the weekly paclitaxel group were older and more frequently
had angiosarcomas arising from the skin. In the doxorubicin group, 34 patients were evaluable for response: 2 (6%)
had complete response, 8 (23.5%) had partial response, 10 (29.5%) had stable disease, and 14 (41%) had progressive
disease. In the weekly paclitaxel group, 68 patients were evaluable for response: 9 (13%) had complete response, 27
(40%) had partial response, 20 (29.5%) had stable disease, and 12 (17.5%) had progressive disease. Objective
responses to weekly paclitaxel were more frequent in cutaneous angiosarcomas, whereas tumor location did not
impact response to doxorubicin. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 3.9-6.0 months). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.4-10.7 months). On multivariate
analysis, ECOG performance status (PS) was the sole independent factor associated with PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: First-line single-agent doxorubicin and weekly paclitaxel seem to have similar efficacy in metastatic angiosarcomas. Cutaneous angiosarcomas respond favorably to weekly paclitaxel. Best supportive care should be considered

KEYWORDS: angiosarcoma, chemotherapy, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, prognosis.

Angiosarcoma represents a rare (< 2%) subgroup of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) characterized by an aggressive
clinical behavior.1 Radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy when indicated represent the cornerstone of treatment for
patients with localized disease. However, despite an adequate locoregional treatment, up to 50% of patients will develop
metastatic relapse and will die of disease.2 The role of chemotherapy in advanced angiosarcomas is not clear. Indeed, the
interpretation of the literature related to this topic is complicated by the fact that prospective studies have, until recently,
considered STS as a homogeneous tumor type, with chemotherapy comprising essentially doxorubicin and/or ifosfamide
in various regimens.
Because multiagent chemotherapy has not been shown superior to single-agent chemotherapy with doxorubicin
alone in term of overall survival (OS), doxorubicin monotherapy is still considered the first-line standard treatment for
patients with metastatic STS.3 In recent years, however, the insight has emerged that systemic therapy should become
more tailored, in particular with respect to specific sarcoma histology. This approach is clearly illustrated by the remarkable efficacy of imatinib in advanced dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,4,5 the significant activity of gemcitabine in

leiomyosarcomas,6,7 of trabectedin in myxoid/round cell
liposarcomas,8 and of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in perivascular epithelioid cell tumors
(PEComas).9,10
Interestingly, single case reports,11-14 single-center
retrospective series,15-18 and 1 histology-specific phase 2
study19 have shown that paclitaxel, a drug considered
inactive against STS, has significant activity in angiosarcomas, particularly when administered in a weekly schedule.
Therefore, STS guidelines recommend paclitaxel as an
alternative option to single-agent doxorubicin in this
specific histological type.20 However, angiosarcoma itself
represents a heterogeneous group of tumors with distinct
presentations, natural history, and genomic profiles,
depending on etiology and tumor location.2,21,22
The aim of this multi-institutional, retrospective
study is to compare the respective efficacy of single-agent
doxorubicin and weekly paclitaxel and to identify predictive factors of outcome that may help clinicians choose the
more appropriate regimen for their patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From 1990 to 2010, 269 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic angiosarcoma were admitted to 1 of the 14 participating institutions (13 institutions of the French Sarcoma
Group and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
New York, NY). Clinical and pathologic data were
collected by reviewing medical records and were entered
in a comprehensive database. The histological diagnosis
was established according to the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours1 by an expert pathologist.
Among these patients, 117 patients received single-agent
doxorubicin (60-75 mg/m2 on day 1, cycle ¼ day 21) or
weekly paclitaxel (typically 80 mg/m2/day on days 1, 8,
15, cycle ¼ day 28) in the first-line setting.
Treatments and Evaluation
The choice of chemotherapy regimen and duration of
treatment were at the discretion of the treating physician.
The best response to treatment was evaluated by magnetic
resonance imaging or computed tomography according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
(RECIST).23 Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
as the time from the start of chemotherapy until disease
progression, death, or last patient contact. OS was defined
as the time from the start of chemotherapy until death or
last patient contact.

Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis of baseline demographics and clinical outcome is based on all data available up to the cutoff
date of December 30, 2010. Survival rates were estimated
with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. Descriptive
statistics were used to show the distribution of variables in
the population. Differences between groups were evaluated by the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous
variables. Prognostic factors were planned to be identified
by univariate and multivariate analyses by using the Cox
regression model. Variables tested in univariate analysis
included: age (< 63 years vs  64 years), sex, primary tumor location (cutaneous angiosarcoma vs other locations),
histological subtype (epithelioid vs nonepithelioid), primary versus radiation-induced angiosarcoma, synchronous versus metachronous metastases, number of
metastatic sites (1 vs  2), metastatic sites (nonvisceral vs
visceral), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) (0 or 1 vs  2), and type of chemotherapy
regimen (doxorubicin vs weekly paclitaxel). Variables
associated with PFS or OS with a P value < .05 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). All statistical
tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was used to define statistical significance.

RESULTS
Patients and Treatments
The study population included 117 patients. Their characteristics are described in Table 1. Seventy-five patients
(64%) were treated with weekly paclitaxel and 42 (36%)
with single-agent doxorubicin. Patients in the weekly
paclitaxel group were significantly more likely to be older
and to have angiosarcomas arising from the skin.
Response
In the doxorubicin group, 34 patients were evaluable for
response: 2 (6%) had complete response, 8 (23.5%) had
partial response, 10 (29.5%) had stable disease (6 of them
lasting > 6 months), and 14 (41%) had progressive
disease. In the weekly paclitaxel group, 68 patients were
evaluable for response: 9 (13%) had complete response,
27 (40%) had partial response, 20 (29.5%) had stable
disease (9 of them lasting > 6 months), and 12 (17.5%)
had progressive disease. In the doxorubicin group, the
clinicopathologic factors significantly associated with a
higher objective response rate were: radiation-related

etiology (50% vs 15%; P ¼ .03) and absence of visceral
metastasis (74% vs 42%; P ¼ .015). In the paclitaxel
group, the clinicopathologic factors significantly associated with a higher objective response rate were: age > 64
years (66.5% vs 34.5%; P ¼ .009), radiation-related etiology (74% vs 45%; P ¼ .03), cutaneous primary tumor
site (78% vs 40%; P ¼ .003), absence of visceral metastasis (66.7% vs 21.5%; P ¼ .03), and 1 metastatic site versus
 2 metastatic sites (75% vs 46%; P ¼ .04). The objective

3332

response rate was significantly higher in the weekly paclitaxel group than in the doxorubicin group (53% vs 29%;
P ¼ .02).
Because the primary tumor site was the sole characteristic significantly unbalanced between the 2 groups, an
analysis restricted to the group of noncutaneous angiosarcomas was performed. No significant difference in terms
of objective response rate between weekly paclitaxel and
doxorubicin was observed in this subgroup (40% vs 26%;
P ¼ .2).
Survival
The median follow-up was 37.8 months (range,
27.6-47.9 months). Median PFS was 4.9 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 3.9-6.0 months) (Fig. 1A). The
3-month, 6-month, and 1-year PFS rates were 66% (95%
CI, 64-69%), 38% (95% CI, 29-47%), and 18% (95%
CI, 13-23%), respectively. On univariate analysis, extracutaneous location, visceral metastases, > 1 metastatic site,
and a PS  2 were adverse prognostic factors for PFS
(Table 2). On multivariate analysis, PS was the sole factor
independently associated with PFS, with a hazard ratio of
1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3; P ¼ .003).
At the time of analysis, 94 patients (64%) had died
and 23 (36%) were still alive. Eighty-six deaths (91.5%)
were related to the disease, and 2 were related to the toxicity of chemotherapy (1 patient with neutropenic sepsis in
each treatment group). A total of 25 deaths (26.5%)
occurred < 3 months after the onset of chemotherapy,
and 15 of these patients (60%) had a PS  2 when treatment was started. Median OS was 8.5 months (95% CI,
6.4-10.7 months) (Fig. 1B). The 6-month, 1-year, and 2year OS rates were 63% (95% CI, 55-71%), 37% (95%
CI, 34-41%), and 19% (95% CI, 17-22%), respectively.
On univariate analysis, male sex, extracutaneous location,
visceral metastases, > 1 metastatic sites, a PS  2, and
single-agent doxorubicin were adverse prognostic factors
for OS (Table 2). On multivariate analysis, PS was the
sole factor independently associated with OS, with a hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P < .0001).
Patient Care After First-Line Chemotherapy
Data regarding the management of patients after first-line
chemotherapy were available for 43 individuals. Twentysix patients (18 patients in the weekly paclitaxel group,
8 patients in the doxorubicin group) received at least 1
new line of chemotherapy. The proportion of patients
receiving second-line chemotherapy was similar in the
paclitaxel group and in the doxorubicin group (64% vs
53%; P ¼ .7).

paclitaxel. Our results showed that cytotoxic chemotherapy was associated with a clinical benefit (objective
response plus stable disease > 6 months) in approximately
60% of patients, indicating the relatively high chemosensitivity of this sarcoma subtype. In our series, weekly paclitaxel was the most frequent regimen used in the first-line
setting. This underscores the increasing use of histologydriven chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of
advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, even if no level 1 evidence is
available. Indeed, the strength of evidence that is achievable in common cancers is difficult to achieve in the field of
soft-tissue sarcomas. Therefore, retrospective studies are
informative and are used for therapeutic decision-making
by medical oncologists involved in the management of
rare tumors.
Our results suggest that single-agent doxorubicin
and weekly paclitaxel have similar efficacy in angiosarcomas. Doxorubicin was associated with an objective
response rate of 29.5% but a median PFS of only 3
months. These results are in agreement with the limited
available literature consisting of a phase 2 study showing
response in 1 of 3 angiosarcoma patients treated with
single-agent doxorubicin24 and in a retrospective series of
12 patients showing a PFS of 3.7 months.17 Weekly paclitaxel was associated with an objective response rate of
53% and a longer median PFS of 5.8 months. These
results also confirm those of previous smaller retrospective
series showing response rates ranging between 62% and
89% and PFS between 4 and 7.6 months.15-18
In our series, objective responses to weekly paclitaxel
were more frequent in angiosarcomas arising from the

3334

skin, whereas tumor location did not affect response to
doxorubicin. This confirms the higher sensitivity to paclitaxel of cutaneous angiosarcomas, which was previously
suggested in retrospective studies15-18 and in a small
histology-specific phase 2 trial.19 Therefore, at least 1 reason for the higher response rate observed in the weekly
paclitaxel group was the imbalance in the proportion of
cutaneous angiosarcomas between the 2 groups. Moreover, no significant difference in terms of PFS was
observed. This suggests that PFS, rather than objective
tumor response, is a better endpoint for future randomized phase 2 trials assessing the activity of potential new
agents of interest compared with existing therapeutic
strategies (doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel). Moreover, in
our experience, evaluation by RECIST is difficult for cutaneous angiosarcomas.
Interestingly, objective responses were more frequent in radiation-induced angiosarcomas than in primary angiosarcomas, irrespective of the drug used.
Radiation-induced angiosarcomas are characterized by
a consistent amplification of the MYC oncogene.22
Several preclinical studies have suggested that MYC
overexpression sensitizes tumor cells to radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, although conflicting results have
been reported.25-32 Our data seem to support the contention of relative sensitivity of c-MYC–overexpressing
angiosarcomas. However, we have also observed objective response in primary angiosarcomas, and a significant percentage of secondary angiosarcomas did
not respond to chemotherapy. Therefore, although the
predictive value of MYC amplification may deserve

Cancer

Chemotherapy in Angiosarcomas/Italiano et al

further investigation, it is likely that other molecular
aberrations are involved in the sensitivity of angiosarcomas to anticancer drugs. Further studies are needed
in this setting. For instance, a recent in vitro study
suggested that mutations of VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2; KDR), which are
present in approximately 10% to 15% of angiosarcomas, may be predictive of efficacy of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors targeting this crucial receptor of
angiogenesis.33
In our series, the sole clinical factor associated with
PFS and OS was PS. PS was already found to be a crucial
prognostic factor for OS in large STS database studies.34
More recently, PS  2 was also identified as the most significant risk factor for early death (<3 months) in
advanced STS patients who were treated with first-line
chemotherapy.35 Of note, in our study, 26.5% of deaths
occurred < 3 months after onset of chemotherapy, and
60% of these patients had a PS  2 when treatment was
started. Considering the high risk of early death of
patients who have poor PS, the decision to administer
chemotherapy instead of best supportive care should be
carefully assessed in this setting, given its potential lack of
benefit.
The retrospective design of this study did not allow
us to report exhaustively the adverse events related to
chemotherapy. However, the review of the medical
records indicated that the majority of patients did not
exhibit significant complications, except for 2 deaths due
to neutropenic sepsis. Because weekly paclitaxel and
doxorubicin appears to have similar efficacy, the comorbidities and the preference of the patients should be considered for the choice of the chemotherapy regimen. In
our series, the majority of elderly patients (aged  75
years) received weekly paclitaxel. This may be related to
the fact that many medical oncologists are still reluctant to
use anthracyclines in elderly patients because of concerns
about cardiac tolerance.36 However, our data indicate that
weekly paclitaxel may represent an efficient alternative to
doxorubicin in elderly patients, in particular those with
cardiac and respiratory comorbidities that preclude the
use of cardiotoxic drugs. Alternatively, low-dose weekly
doxorubicin37 or other forms of anthracyclines such as
liposomal pegylated doxorubicin16,17 may provide other
means to treat angiosarcomas in an older population.
The French Sarcoma Group has recently shown in a
retrospective study that included 149 angiosarcoma
patients treated with miscellaneous chemotherapy
regimens that chemotherapy improves outcome in

Cancer

comparison with best supportive care.38 By extending our
initial data set, this European-American collaborative
study confirms that angiosarcomas are at least initially
chemosensitive, and indicates that doxorubicin and
weekly paclitaxel appear largely equivalent in terms of efficacy in the first-line setting. However, the OS of patients
of metastatic angiosarcoma remains poor. Recently, gemcitabine was shown to have some clinical efficacy,39 and
antiangiogenic agents40,41 are also under investigation
with at least minor activity. Moreover, a combination
chemotherapy regimen might be associated with
improved outcome in a subset of angiosarcoma patients,
as suggested by Fury et al in a study showing higher PFS
in 6 patients who were treated with doxorubicin-ifosfamide combined chemotherapy.17 Further collaborative
studies are needed to refine the role of new therapeutic
options in the management of this rare disease.
