Abstract
Paclitaxel is a microtubule-targeting antineoplastic drug
widely used in human cancers. Even when tumors are initially
responsive, progression of disease despite continued taxane
therapy is all too common in the treatment of many of the
most common epithelial cancers, including breast cancer.
However, the mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance in
cancer cells are not completely understood. Our hypothesis is
that changes in the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) cell death
pathway controlled by the BCL-2 family are key to the
development of acquired paclitaxel resistance. Here we show
that paclitaxel activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway,
which can be blocked by BCL-2 overexpression. Treatment
with ABT-737, a small-molecule BCL-2 antagonist, restores
sensitivity to paclitaxel in BCL-2–overexpressing cells. To
investigate the importance of changes in the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway in the absence of enforced BCL-2 expression, we generated two independent breast cancer cell lines
with acquired resistance to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel.
In these lines, acquired resistance to paclitaxel is mediated
either by increased antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreased
proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. In both cases, ABT-737 can
engage the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway to restore
sensitivity to paclitaxel to cell lines with acquired paclitaxel
resistance. In summary, these findings suggest that alterations
in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway controlled by BCL-2 protein
family members may be crucial to causing paclitaxel resistance. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining smallmolecule BCL-2 antagonists with paclitaxel may offer benefit
to patients with paclitaxel-resistant tumors, an oncologic
problem of great prevalence. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7985–94]

Introduction
Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the success
of cancer therapy. Resistance may be present at the onset of
therapeutic intervention and patients initially fail to respond
(intrinsic or innate chemoresistance), or it may emerge over time
during chemotherapy (acquired chemoresistance), even after a
dramatic initial response (1). In epithelial tumors including breast,
ovarian, and lung cancers, resistance to chemotherapy is frequently
observed and is associated with poor clinical outcome (2–5).
Paclitaxel is a diterpenoid compound initially isolated from
Taxus brevifolia and is widely used against malignant epithelial
tumors. Paclitaxel mainly targets h-tubulin at the molecular level

and stabilizes microtubule dynamics to induce microtubule
polymerization (6). There are a variety of mechanisms responsible
for the development of chemoresistance in cancer cells: reduced
drug uptake or increased drug efflux, increased repair of drug
targets, alteration of drug targets that prevent drug binding or
action, and blocks in biochemical pathways that mediate druginduced cytotoxicity. Development of acquired paclitaxel-resistance has been attributed to such mechanisms, including overexpression of P-glycoprotein, alterations in tubulin composition,
and mutations in h-tubulin (7–10). Nearly every patient with
advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the United States receives
a taxane as part of their chemotherapy. Therefore, those who die of
their disease have generally ceased to respond to taxanes.
One can greatly simplify the pathway of chemotherapy
response into three main steps. In the first step, drug must
accumulate in the cell in sufficient concentration. In the second
step, the drug must interact with target. In the third step, death
signals generated from drug interaction with target must interact
with a receptive apoptotic pathway. Acquired resistance due to
blocking of the first two steps has been examined for paclitaxel.
The third step, involving alteration of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway, has not been well explored as a mechanism of acquired
paclitaxel resistance.
Apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, is an essential
mechanism for cell death following many types of chemotherapy.
The mitochondrial (or intrinsic) apoptosis pathway is mainly
regulated by the interplay between members of the BCL-2 protein
family. Following apoptotic stimuli, including many kinds of
chemotherapy, cytochrome c is released into the cytosol from
mitochondria as a result of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which is followed by the formation of the apoptosome
complex and caspase activation (11). The key, essentially irreversible
step in the commitment to apoptotic death is the permeabilization
of the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is this step that is
controlled by the interaction of BCL-2 family proteins.
Proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins can be classified into two main
groups: multidomain proapoptotic proteins (BAX and BAK) and
BH3-only proteins (BID, BIM, BAD, NOXA, PUMA, BMF, BIK,
and HRK). In response to death stimuli, BH3-only proteins are
up-regulated by numerous means, including transcriptional upregulation, posttranslational modification, and subcellular localization. Certain BH3-only proteins, the so-called activators, which
include BID and BIM, induce the activation of BAX and BAK.
Activated BAX and BAK undergo a conformational change, which
can be recognized by conformation-specific antibodies, and
oligomerize. Oligomerized BAX and BAK, perhaps in a complex
with other proteins, induce permeabilization of the outer
mitochondrial membrane, which allows diffusion of proapoptotic
proteins, including cytochrome c from the intermembrane space.
Antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, BCL-w, and
BFL-1 control the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c by
sequestering proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. BAD, NOXA,

PUMA, BMF, BIK, and HRK, known as sensitizers, act as inhibitors
of the inhibitors of apoptosis, displacing activators from antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins, which are then freed to trigger activation
and oligomerization of BAX and BAK (12, 13). Adding to this
complexity, antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins exhibit selective binding
affinities to sensitizer BH3-only proteins, and the dynamic nature
of these interactions frequently dictates the fate of the cell in
response to apoptotic stimuli, either death or survival.
Here we systematically investigate, for the first time, whether
alterations in the apoptotic pathway are responsible for resistance
to paclitaxel. We find that breast cancer cell lines that acquire
resistance increase antiapoptotic protein expression or decrease
proapoptotic protein expression. ABT-737 is a small-molecule
inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-w that binds to the BH3binding cleft with very high affinity (14). ABT-737 was reported to
elicit apoptosis either as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapeutics against several cancer cell types, including
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, non–small cell lung cancer, and various
leukemias (13, 15–27). An orally available derivative of ABT-737,
ABT-263, is currently in study in clinical trials for non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and small-cell lung
cancer. We find that we can reverse acquired resistance to paclitaxel using ABT-737. We suggest that combination therapy of
taxanes with ABT-737 may be a useful strategy to attack the serious
clinical problem of acquired taxane resistance in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were grown in DMEM/
F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Insulin (5 Ag/mL; Sigma) was added to DMEM/F12 used for the culture of
MCF-7 and T47D cells.
The paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were derived as
described before (28). Following selection of paclitaxel-resistant clonal lines,
MCF-7 TaxR30 and MCF-7 TaxR50 were maintained in the presence of
30 and 50 nmol/L of paclitaxel, respectively; MDA-MB-468 TaxR was
maintained in the presence of 15 nmol/L paclitaxel. All paclitaxel-resistant
cell lines were grown in the presence of 5 Ag/mL verapamil.
MCF-7 and T47D cells were stably transfected with either pCINeo.FlagBCL-2 (MCF-7 BCL-2 and T47D BCL-2) or pCI-Neo.FLAG plasmid
(MCF-7 Mock and T47D Mock) using Fugene 6 (Roche), and clonal selection
was carried out in the presence of G418 (1.2 mg/mL; Sigma). The resulting
clones were assayed by detection of BCL-2 or FLAG-tag by immunoblot
analysis. Selected clones were maintained in growth medium with
0.2 mg/mL G418.
Chemicals. Paclitaxel was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in
DMSO. ABT-737 and ABT-737 enantiomer were provided by Abbott
Laboratories. Caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-FMK), pancaspase inhibitor
(z-VAD-FMK), and caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-FMK) were obtained from
BD Biosciences PharMingen.
Cell viability and apoptotic assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by
Annexin V-FITC (BioVision) staining according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences), followed by analysis using WinMDI 2.9 software (Scripps
Institute). For determination of EC50 values for paclitaxel in parental and
resistant cells lines, cell viability was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions following treatment with various concentrations of paclitaxel. The results were from three experiments in triplicate.
The EC50 values for paclitaxel in parental and resistant cells were
determined by nonlinear regression of sigmoidal dose-response curves
using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software.

Colony-forming assay. Colony-forming assay was done as described
previously (29). Briefly, paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells
were plated in 24-well plates and treated with drugs for 16 h. Cells were
counted and replated into 60-mm tissue culture dishes (200 per plate).
Following 10 d of incubation, tissue culture plates were stained with crystal
violet [0.5% crystal violet in a 3:1 (v/v) mixture of distilled water/methanol]
and colonies were counted. Results were expressed as the percentage of
colony formation by untreated control cells.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Total cell lysates were
prepared in 1% Chaps buffer [5 mmol/L MgCl2, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Chaps, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and
protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche)] as described previously (30). To
monitor the activation of BAX and BAK, proteins (800 Ag) were immunoprecipitated with anti-BAX (6A7; BD PharMingen) and anti-BAK (Ab-2,
Oncogene Research) at 4jC for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were captured by
50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose in lysis buffer (GE Healthcare) at 4jC
for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were then recovered by centrifugation and
washed thrice in 1% Chaps buffer. Immunoprecipitates, total cell extracts
(40 Ag), and subfractionation lysates (30 Ag) were separated on NuPage 10%
Bis-Tris gels. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) and then blocked
with 5% dried milk in PBS-Tween20. Membranes were incubated with
primary and secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing
10% milk diluent blocking concentrate (KPL), detected with Western
Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (Perkin-Elmer), and exposed to
Biomax MR film (Kodak). For detection of some immunoprecipitates,
protein A-horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare) was used as a secondary
detection agent. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting:
anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti–BCL-2, anti–BCL-XL, anti-BMF, anti-BAD, antiPUMA, anti–h-actin, anti–caspase-3, anti–caspase-9, anti–caspase-8, (Cell
Signaling), anti-BAX (N20; Santa Cruz), anti-BAK (G-23; Santa Cruz),
anti-BIM (22–40; Calbiochem), anti–cytochrome c (6H2.B4; BD Biosciences),
and anti-CoxIV (Molecular Probes).
Caspase activation assays. The activity of caspase-3, caspase-9, and
caspase-8 was determined using ApoAlert Caspase Profiling Plate
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The release of fluorochrome 7-amino-4-methyl coumarin was analyzed at 380-nm excitation and
460-nm emission using a multiplate fluorescence spectrophotometer. Data
shown are mean F SE of three independent experiments in duplicate and
expressed in arbitrary fluorescence units per milligram of protein.
Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was done as
described before (31). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold
PBS and then resuspended in an isotonic buffer [250 mmol/L sucrose,
20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L KCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche)] on ice for 20 min. Following incubation, cells were homogenized with Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged
at 800  g for 10 min at 4jC. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged
at 8,000  g for 20 min at 4jC to obtain mitochondrial and cytosolic
fractions. These fractions were used to monitor cytochrome c release from
mitochondria. Mitochondrial fractions were lysed in 1% Chaps buffer for
immunoblot analysis.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance of the results was analyzed
by Student’s t test using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software. P < 0.05 and P < 0.01
were considered significant.

Results
ABT-737 treatment overcomes BCL-2–mediated resistance
to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. If a type of cell death operates
via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, we would expect that
BCL-2 overexpression would block the death. We first tested
whether BCL-2 overexpression could block apoptosis due to paclitaxel treatment. MCF-7 and T47D cells were stably transfected with
either pCI-Neo.FlagBCL-2 (MCF-7 BCL-2 and T47D BCL-2) or
control vector (MCF-7 Mock and T47D Mock). The overexpression

of BCL-2 was verified by immunoblotting of total cell extracts
with anti–BCL-2 or FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A and C). Both parental
and transfected cells were treated with 100 nmol/L paclitaxel for
48 hours and analyzed for apoptotic response by Annexin V staining. The results clearly showed the protection against paclitaxelinduced apoptosis by BCL-2 overexpression in MCF-7 and T47D
cells (Fig. 1B and D). These results imply that the mitochondrial
(or intrinsic) apoptotic pathway, which is controlled by the BCL-2
family of proteins, is necessary for apoptosis following paclitaxel
treatment.
ABT-737 is a cell-permeable BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-w inhibitor
that was shown to induce apoptosis in various cancer cell types as
a single agent and in combination with chemotherapeutics (18–20,

23–26). Therefore, we evaluated whether treatment with ABT-737
could reverse BCL-2–mediated protection against paclitaxelinduced apoptosis in MCF-7 BCL-2 and T47D BCL-2 cells. As
shown in Fig. 1B and D, ABT-737 efficiently augmented paclitaxelinduced apoptosis in MCF-7 BCL-2 and T47D BCL-2 cells, although
its negative control enantiomer did not exert such an effect.
Notably, ABT-737 or negative control enantiomer did not elicit a
significant effect when used alone. Moreover, combining ABT-737
or negative control enantiomer with paclitaxel did not enhance
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in parental or mock-transfected
MCF-7 or T47D cells. Of interest, cotreatment of parental MCF-7
and T47D cells with ABT-737 and 0 to 100 nmol/L of paclitaxel did
not elicit a major effect on apoptotic response, except a slight, but

Activation of BAX and BAK was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with active conformation-specific anti-BAX (6A7) and anti-BAK (Ab-2) antibodies followed by

100 nmol/L ABT-737 was combined with 50 nmol/L paclitaxel in
MCF-7 cells (results not shown).
Because BCL-2 family proteins control the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway, our expectation was that the sensitization
effect of ABT-737 on BCL-2–overexpressing breast cancer cells also
operated through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In support
of this expectation, we found that cotreatment with paclitaxel and
ABT-737 induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,
as measured by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria
(Fig. 2A). The conformational change in BAX and BAK that

accompanies apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway was also
observed following cotreatment (Fig. 2B). Caspase-9 activation
accompanies apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway,
whereas activation of caspase-8 accompanies activation via the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Caspase assays showed the activation
of caspase-9, but not caspase-8, in MCF-7 BCL-2 cells treated
with the combination of ABT-737 and paclitaxel (Fig. 2C). Demonstrating that caspase-9 activation was required for cell death
and not simply a synchronous phenomenon, pretreatment with

Paclitaxel Resistance Reversed by ABT-737

ABT-737–mediated sensitization of MCF-7 BCL-2 cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that the
apoptotic block against paclitaxel treatment imparted by BCL-2
overexpression could be overcome by cotreatment with the
BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 in breast cancer cells, resulting in a
restoration of death via the mitochondrial (or intrinsic) apoptotic
pathway.
Acquired resistance to paclitaxel is mediated by alterations
in BCL-2 protein family members. The above experiments
established that enforced changes in the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway could mediate resistance to paclitaxel. We next asked
whether changes in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were
selected for in models of paclitaxel resistance in which resistance
was passively derived by long-term exposure to the drug. To
establish paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cell lines, we exposed
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells to increasing concentrations of
paclitaxel for short times. MCF-7 is an estrogen receptor–positive,
p53-wild-type breast cancer cell line whereas MDA-MB-468 is an
estrogen receptor–negative, p53-mutated breast cancer cell line;
they were chosen to represent the different genetic properties of
primary breast cancer tumors. After resistant cell pools were

developed, we selected individual resistant clones by continuous
exposure to paclitaxel. Two different clones of MCF-7 with different
levels of resistance against paclitaxel were generated and
designated as MCF-7 TaxR30 and MCF-7 TaxR50. Additionally, a
paclitaxel-resistant clone of MDA-MB-468 was established and
designated as MDA-MB-468 TaxR. EC50 values for paclitaxel in
parental and resistant cell lines were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis of dose-response curves (Fig. 3A). MCF-7
TaxR30 and MCF-7 TaxR50 cells tolerated f100- and f150-fold
greater doses of paclitaxel treatment in comparison with parental
MCF-7 cells, respectively. Similarly, MDA-MB-468 TaxR cells
tolerated f15-fold greater doses of paclitaxel when compared
with parental MDA-MB-468 cells.
The expressions of BCL-2 family proteins in parental and
paclitaxel-resistant clones were compared. Because we were
interested in permanent changes established by selection rather
than changes due to presence of drug, we compared continuous
paclitaxel to withdrawing paclitaxel from media for 24 hours
before isolation of total proteins, although in practice this had
little effect on our findings. We then analyzed proteins isolated
from resistant clones grown in media in which paclitaxel was

reduce the possibility of acute paclitaxel-mediated variations in protein levels (marked with ‘‘ ’’). Total cellular proteins were isolated in the presence or in the absence
of paclitaxel in growth media and analyzed in parallel. h-Actin was probed as a loading control.

either restored or absent. As shown in Fig. 3B, BCL-2 and BCL-XL
levels were increased in MCF-7 TaxR30 and MCF-7 TaxR50 cells
compared with parental cells. We could not detect any change in
expression levels of other BCL-2 proteins. Correspondingly, there
were decreased levels of both BCL-XL and BIM in paclitaxelresistant MDA-MB-468 TaxR cells in comparison with parental
MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, no significant alterations in
other BCL-2 protein family members were found in MDA-MB-468
TaxR cells. These results indicate that the acquired resistance to
paclitaxel may be promoted either by increased levels of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins (BCL-2 and BCL-XL) or by decreased levels
of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (BIM) in breast cancer cells.
BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 restores the sensitivity to paclitaxel
in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells. ABT-737 antagonizes
BCL-2 function by acting as a mimetic of the BH3 domain of
proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. Thus, it seemed possible that

treatment with ABT-737 might reverse resistance induced by
either increased expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-XL or
decreased expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins BIM.
As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of paclitaxel-resistant MCF-7
TaxR30 and MCF-7 TaxR50 cells with ABT-737 resulted in restoration of paclitaxel sensitivity in these cells as determined by
Annexin V staining. To verify that the observed effects were
occurring via the mitochondrial pathway, we monitored cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Paclitaxel treatment
induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release in parental MCF-7
cells, and as seen in Fig. 4B, increased sensitivity of MCF-7
TaxR50 to paclitaxel when combined with ABT-737 was also
accompanied by increased translocation of cytochrome c into
cytosol. To further delineate the molecular mechanisms of
ABT-737–mediated sensitization to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis,
MCF-7 TaxR50 cells were treated with paclitaxel, ABT-737, or

both, and activation of BAX and BAK was evaluated by immunoprecipitation with conformation-specific antibodies. When
paclitaxel-resistant cells were treated with the combination of
paclitaxel and ABT-737, a significantly increased activation of BAX
and BAK was detected in MCF-7 TaxR50 cells (Fig. 4C). No such
effect was observed on exposure to either paclitaxel or ABT-737
alone. Thus, as expected, ABT-737 targets a pathway upstream of
BAX and BAK activation in MCF-7 TaxR50 cells to promote
sensitization to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
To confirm the engagement of caspases downstream of mitochondria, we assayed the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-8 in
MCF-7 TaxR50 cells by immunoblot analysis and fluorometric
caspase activation assays in response to treatment with paclitaxel,
ABT-737, or the combination of both. As shown in Fig. 4D (middle),
elevated levels of active caspase-9 were induced by paclitaxel and

ABT-737 when compared with treatment with paclitaxel or ABT-737
alone in MCF-7 TaxR50 cells. In contrast, caspase-8 was not activated
in this cell line. Fluorometric caspase assays further confirmed the
enhanced activation of caspase-9 by the combination of paclitaxel
and ABT-737 in MCF-7 TaxR50 cells (Fig. 4D, left). Additionally,
pretreatment with pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK and caspase-9
inhibitor z-LEHD-FMK markedly abolished ABT-737–mediated
sensitization of MCF-7 TaxR50 cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis,
although caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-FMK did not elicit such a
similar effect (Fig. 4D, right). Thus, ABT-737 restores taxane
sensitivity to resistant MCF-7 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway controlled by BCL-2 family proteins, consistent with ABT737 acting at the expected target.
Similarly, the combination of paclitaxel and ABT-737 also led to a
restored apoptotic response in MDA-MB-468 TaxR cells (Fig. 5A).

On the contrary, no such effect was observed in parental MDA-MB468 cells when ABT-737 was used in combination with paclitaxel
(0–100 nmol/L; results not shown). Treatment of MDA-MB-468
parental cells with paclitaxel (100 nmol/L) triggered apoptosis
(Fig. 5A) and induced the release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm
(Fig. 5B). In parallel to apoptotic response, paclitaxel plus ABT-737
treatment resulted in the release of cytochrome c into cytosol in
MDA-MB-468 TaxR cells, although treatment with paclitaxel or

ABT-737 alone did not show such an effect (Fig. 5B). Activation of
BAX and BAK was also drastically enhanced in MDA-MB-468 TaxR
cells treated paclitaxel plus ABT-737 in comparison with treatment
with paclitaxel or ABT-737 alone (Fig. 5C). In addition, activation
of caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8 was detected when MDAMB-468 TaxR cells treated with paclitaxel plus ABT-737 as shown
by immunoblot analysis and fluorometric caspase activation
assays (Fig. 5D, left, middle). Correspondingly, pretreatment with

z-VAD-FMK and z-LEHD-FMK attenuated ABT-737–mediated
sensitization of MDA-MB-468 TaxR cells to paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis; caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-FMK exerted only a partial
protective effect (Fig. 5D, right).
To further show the cytotoxic effect of combining ABT-737 with
paclitaxel in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, MCF-7 TaxR50 and MDAMB-468 TaxR cells were treated with paclitaxel, ABT-737, or the
combination of both for 16 hours and the survival capability of cells
was evaluated by colony formation assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, the
combination of paclitaxel with ABT-737 led to the loss of colony
formation capability of paclitaxel-resistant cells, although treatment
with paclitaxel or ABT-737 did not exert a similar effect.
Thus, alterations of BCL-2 family proteins may contribute to the
acquired resistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells, and ABT-737
could selectively restore paclitaxel-induced apoptosis via the
mitochondrial pathway in these resistant cells. A summary of these
alterations is presented in Fig. 6B. Briefly, in paclitaxel-sensitive cells
before treatment, antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins are present in
sufficient quantity to sequester existing activator BH3-only proteins.
Following paclitaxel treatment, additional BH3-only proteins are
activated by changes in subcellular localization, increase in protein
abundance, or posttranslational modifications. These new proteins
compete for the BH3 binding site in antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins,
exceeding the total BH3 binding capacity. Unsequestered activator
BH3-only proteins, including BIM, trigger apoptosis by activating
BAX and BAK (Fig. 6A). We found that cancer cells could select to
block this chain of events in two ways: First, in the MCF-7 cells,
apoptosis could be blocked by increased expression of antiapoptotic
BCL-2 proteins, preventing BAX and BAK activation through
effective sequestration of more activators and sensitizers (Fig. 6B).
Second, as in the MDA-MB-468 cells, decreased expression of BH3only activators reduces the proapoptotic load so that death signaling
induced by paclitaxel is insufficient to overwhelm the antiapoptotic
BH3 domain binding capacity (Fig. 6C). ABT-737 can reverse these
mechanisms of resistance by restoring increased competition for
BH3 domain binding sites, thus yielding more unsequestered
activator BH3-only proteins to activate BAX and BAK.

Discussion
Acquired resistance to treatment negatively affects the outcome
of chemotherapy in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (1).
Many tumors show an initial sensitivity to chemotherapy, resulting
in a good clinical response, even a complete remission with no
remaining evidence of disease. All too often, however, the cancer
recurs in a form that is newly resistant to the initially successful
chemotherapy.
Many chemotherapeutics, including paclitaxel, have been shown
to exert their effect through engagement and activation of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway (1, 32–34). However, most studies
of paclitaxel resistance have focused on events upstream of
engagement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, either on drug
interacting with target or entry of drug into cell. Paclitaxel binds to
the NH2-terminal domain of h-tubulin to initiate microtubule
polymerization. Resistance to paclitaxel treatment was shown to be
mediated by alterations in tubulin composition or mutations in
the paclitaxel-binding region of h-tubulin (8, 10). Overexpression of

P-glycoprotein was also reported in a variety of tumor cells, and
P-glycoprotein was proposed to play a role in resistance to paclitaxel
treatment (7). Heretofore lacking is an examination of whether
induced resistance to paclitaxel is often conferred by alterations in
the control of apoptotic cell death. This question becomes more
pressing as novel drugs that interact with BCL-2 proteins are now in
clinical trials.
We provide evidence here that paclitaxel uses the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines,
consistent with previous reports (35, 36) When drugs kill using this
pathway, they do so by increasing the balance of proapoptotic proteins
compared with antiapoptotic proteins at the mitochondria. BH3-only
proteins are often the most dynamic participants in this process, and
we and others have found that, indeed, signaling by BH3-only proteins
is required for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (37–39).1 It seemed,
therefore, that alterations in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway might
well play an important and heretofore unexamined role in the
acquisition of resistance to paclitaxel in cancer cells.
In fact, our findings indicate, in two independently derived
paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, that a key mediator of acquired
resistance is indeed alteration in the control of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. As none of these changes was enforced, but
rather selected by random mutation, it suggests that such alterations in apoptotic signaling may be quite important in cancers
that acquire resistance to paclitaxel. The resistant MCF-7 lines
exploit this strategy by increasing the expression of BCL-2 and
BCL-XL. In contrast, the MDA-MB-468 cells acquire resistance by
decreasing BIM levels. They simultaneously lower BCL-XL levels
as well, suggesting that the loss of BIM is more significant than
the loss of BCL-XL because the resulting phenotype is resistant to
paclitaxel. Indeed, we have found that BIM plays a critical role in
apoptosis due to paclitaxel in breast cancer cell lines.1
ABT-737 opposes BCL-2 and BCL-XL function by acting as a
mimetic of the BH3 domain of select BH3-only proteins. A test of
whether the observed alterations in BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BIM levels
caused the observed resistance is whether treatment with ABT-737
would reverse the resistance. The restoration of sensitivity to
paclitaxel by ABT-737 suggests that the observed changes are
indeed responsible for the observed resistance.
Detailed understanding of pathways of paclitaxel resistance in
cancer cells can provide important opportunities to design strategies for specifically targeting these pathways. Our results clearly
rationalize the utilization of ABT-737 to augment apoptotic
response induced by paclitaxel whenever chemoresistance against
paclitaxel was conferred by increased expression of BCL-2/BCL-XL
or diminished levels of BIM. In practical terms, our results support
the clinical investigation of antagonism of BCL-2 and BCL-XL
(e.g., with ABT-263) to reverse taxane resistance in breast cancer.
