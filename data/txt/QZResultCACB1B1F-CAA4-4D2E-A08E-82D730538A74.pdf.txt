ABSTRACT
Several studies have highlighted the importance of the PI3K pathway in
melanocytes and its frequent over-activation in melanoma. However, little is known
about regulation of the PI3K pathway in melanocytic cells. We showed that normal
human melanocytes are less sensitive to selective PI3K or mTOR inhibitors than to
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. The resistance to PI3K inhibitor was due to a rapid AKT
reactivation limiting the inhibitor effect on proliferation. Reactivation of AKT was
linked to a feedback mechanism involving the mTORC2 complex and in particular
its scaffold protein RICTOR. RICTOR overexpression in melanocytes disrupted
the negative feedback, activated the AKT pathway and stimulated clonogenicity
highlighting the importance of this feedback to restrict melanocyte proliferation. We
found that the RICTOR locus is frequently amplified and overexpressed in melanoma
and that RICTOR over-expression in NRAS-transformed melanocytes stimulates their
clonogenicity, demonstrating that RICTOR amplification can cooperate with NRAS
mutation to stimulate melanoma proliferation. These results show that RICTOR
plays a central role in PI3K pathway negative feedback in melanocytes and that its
deregulation could be involved in melanoma development.

turn attracts proteins that contain a pleckstrin homology
domain to the cell membrane, including the serinethreonine kinase AKT and phosphoinositide-dependent
kinase-1 (PDK1). AKT, which has three isoforms
(AKT1/2/3), is phosphorylated at two critical and
conserved residues, which activate its catalytic activity.
One residue is in the kinase domain (threonine 308
[Thr308]) and the other in the hydrophobic motif (serine
473 [Ser473]). Thr308 is phosphorylated by membrane
localized PDK1, and Ser473 by the mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). RICTOR is a
component of the mTORC2 complex which is required for
AKT Ser473 phosphorylation [5]. mTORC2 is involved in
cell survival [5–7], actin cytoskeleton remodeling [8, 9]
and glucose transport [10]. Activated AKT phosphorylates
a number of effector proteins, thereby regulating multiple
key cellular processes, including proliferation, survival,
motility, metabolism and angiogenesis. AKT plays a
critical role in survival through the inhibition of BAD

INTRODUCTION
The signaling pathway defined by phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) controls most hallmarks of cancer, including
cell cycle, survival, metabolism, motility and genomic
instability [1]. Cancer genetic studies have shown that
this pathway is among the most frequently altered pathway
in human tumors [2]. In melanoma, multiple lines of
evidence have shown that the PI3K pathway plays a major
role in the pathogenesis of this disease, and cooperates
with activation of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway to
transform melanocytes [3, 4].
PI3K can be activated by multiple signals,
including Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and RAS
proteins among others. Activated PI3K phosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to phos­
phatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which in

[11, 12] as well as the regulation of cell cycle entry by
inactivating glycogen-3 synthase kinase (GSK3), leading
to the activation of cyclin D1 [13]. AKT, through TSC2
phosphorylation and RHEB activation [14], also activates
mTORC1 which is involved in ribosomal biogenesis
and protein synthesis via phosphorylation of S6K and
4EBP1. PTEN regulates the activity of this pathway
by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositols, thereby
antagonizing the activity of PI3K [15].
A large number of studies have shown that the
PI3K pathway is frequently over-activated in melanoma
via multiple ways. The two most common and studied
events are activating mutations in the oncogene NRAS
(15–20%) [16–18], and loss of expression or function of
the tumor suppressor PTEN (11–60%) [16, 19, 20–24],
but mutations of PI3K [25, 26] and AKT3 [27], the
predominant AKT isoform in melanoma [28], have also
been described. Increased AKT activity is also a hallmark
of melanoma resistance to targeted therapy [29–34]. The
central role of PI3K activation in tumor cell biology
has prompted a considerable effort to target PI3K or
downstream kinases, such as AKT and mTOR, in cancer.
However, emerging clinical data show limited singleagent activity of inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT or mTOR
at tolerated doses [35–37]. The development of effective
strategies against this pathway must overcome several
key challenges, in particular feedback loops, and pathway
cross-talk that can mediate resistance. Feedback control
is a common feature of cellular signaling systems, and
the PI3K network provides many examples of complex
feedback perturbations generated by PI3K, AKT and
mTOR inhibitors [38]. The best example is the feedback
induction of AKT phosphorylation by mTORC1 inhibitors,
such as rapamycin [39, 40]. To overcome complex
feedback loops that blunt the activity of single-target
inhibitors against the PI3K–AKT pathway and to achieve
effective clinical targeting of melanoma, it is essential
to better understand the complex regulation of the PI3K
pathway in melanocytes and melanoma.
In this paper we investigate the regulation of the
PI3K pathway in melanocytes and melanoma. We showed
that normal human melanocytes are less sensitive to
selective PI3K or mTOR inhibitors than to dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors. The resistance to PI3K inhibitors is due
to a rapid AKT reactivation following inhibitor treatment,
linked to a feedback mechanism involving RICTOR,
a scaffold protein of the mTORC2 complex. RICTOR
overexpression in melanocytes activates the PI3K pathway
and stimulates clonogenicity. We found that the RICTOR
locus is frequently amplified and overexpressed in
melanoma and that RICTOR over-expression in melanoma
stimulates clonogenicity. These results show that RICTOR
plays a central role in PI3K pathway negative feedback in
melanocytes and that its deregulation could be involved in
melanoma development.

Melanocytes are more sensitive to dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibition than PI3K or mTORC1
inhibition
To address the role of the PI3K pathway in
melanocyte proliferation, Normal Human Epidermal
Melanocytes (NHEMs) and immortal mouse melanocytes
(Melan-a) were treated with increasing doses of mTORC1
inhibitor (Rapamycin), PI3K inhibitor (LY294002),
mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor (OSI-027) or dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor (GDC-0980). LY294002 treatment
did not significantly inhibit melanocyte proliferation
at 2 μmol/L (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1).
However, inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR complexes
(mTORC1 and mTORC2) by GDC-0980 led to a very
strong inhibition of melanocyte proliferation at low
concentration (0.5 μmol/L) (Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure S1). To confirm this result, another selective PI3K
inhibitor (ZST474) with an IC50 for PI3K similar to GDC0980 was used. Melanocyte proliferation was still less
sensitive to ZSTK474 than to GDC-0980 (Supplementary
Figure  S1). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or
inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by OSI-027
had a weaker effect than the combined inhibition of PI3K
and mTOR by GDC-0980 (Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure S1). Therefore, the PI3K pathway and in particular
mTORC1 and mTORC2 seems to play an important role
in both human and murine melanocyte proliferation.
To understand the molecular mechanism of
resistance to PI3K pathway inhibitor, inhibition of the
PI3K pathway was monitored in human melanocytes and
Melan-a by western blotting using AKT phosphorylation
as a marker of pathway activation. Both LY294002 and
GDC-0980 induced a significant inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation at both activation sites (Ser473 and
Thr308) after 5 to 30 minutes of treatment (Figure  1B
and Supplementary Figure S2). However, AKT
phosphorylation increased again after 15 min of treatment
with LY294002 treatment, whereas it remained inhibited
up to 90 min in GDC-0980 treated melanocytes (Figure 1B
and Supplementary Figure S2). A similar reactivation of
AKT was seen after 6 hours of treatment with another
selective PI3K inhibitor (ZSTK 474) but not with GDC0980 (Supplementary Figure S3). These results suggested
the existence of a feedback mechanism downstream of
PI3K and dependent on mTOR complexes that could
stimulate AKT reactivation. The rapid reactivation of AKT
upon LY294002 treatment could explain the low efficiency
of this inhibitor on melanocyte proliferation.
Several feedback mechanisms in the PI3K pathway
have been described. Among them, we further investigated
the feedback mechanism implicating RICTOR, a scaffold
protein from the mTORC2 complex, because it had been
suggested that RICTOR could play a role in cancer [7, 41].

We first showed, using proximity ligation assay,
that RICTOR interacts with AKT in melanocytes
and that this interaction is independent of AKT
phosphorylation, as it is not modulated by GDC-0980
which inhibits AKT phosphorylation (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S4).
RICTOR is regulated by phosphorylation at
threonine 1135 (Th1135) by S6K, downstream of PI3K,
which inactivates mTORC2 and therefore inhibits AKT
phosphorylation at Ser473 [42–44]. We showed that
RICTOR is phosphorylated on Thr1135 in melanocytes
and that both PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and GDC0980, decreased Thr1135 phosphorylation (Figure 1D).
This decrease is linked to an inhibition of S6K activity,
measured by a decrease in phosphorylation of its target:
the ribosomal protein S6 at Ser235/236, in response
to LY294002 and GDC-0980 treatment (Figure 1D).
This inhibition of RICTOR phosphorylation, which
will activate mTORC2, could be responsible for AKT
reactivation in the presence of PI3K inhibitor.

assay was reproduced in the presence of PI3K, mTORC1/
mTORC2 or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. RICTOR
overexpression induced resistance to the PI3K inhibitor
compared to the mTORC1/mTORC2 or dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors (Figure 2D).

RICTOR locus is amplified in melanoma and
deregulates the PIK pathway
As RICTOR overexpression increases melanocyte
clonogenicity, we investigated whether RICTOR
amplification could play a role in melanoma. Using CGH
array, we analyzed the amplification of the RICTOR
locus in a series of 43 melanoma short-term cultures. We
found that the RICTOR locus was amplified in 19 out of
43 melanoma cell lines (44%) and that amplification was
independent of the BRAF and NRAS mutation status
(Figure 3A and Supplemenentary Data). Quantification
of RICTOR mRNA in 22 melanoma short-term cultures
confirmed that RICTOR locus amplification was
associated with an increase in RICTOR mRNA level
(Figure 3B). RICTOR amplification and PTEN loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) were not mutually exclusive and
in BRAF mutated cell lines amplification at the RICTOR
locus were always associated with LOH at PTEN locus
(Supplementary Figure S5). RICTOR amplification
is therefore a frequent event in melanoma and can be
associated with PTEN loss.
To investigate whether RICTOR amplification
could play a role in melanoma development, we stably
overexpressed RICTOR in Melan-a that had been
transformed by G12VNRAS. We used four different
transformed clones expressing different levels of
endogenous RICTOR but with the same genetic
background allowing us to compare the clones exclusively
at the RICTOR level. RICTOR overexpression induced a
statistical increase in colony formation in all four clones
(Figure 3C). Clones overexpressing RICTOR displayed
an increase in AKT phosphorylation demonstrating
that RICTOR overexpression can activate the PI3K/
AKT pathway in melanoma (Figure  3E). This increase
in AKT phosphorylation was associated with an
increase in cyclin D1, which could explain the increase
in colony formation (Figure 3E). Interestingly, clones
expressing higher levels of endogenous RICTOR (6
and 12) showed a higher number of colonies with the
vector control compared to the clones expressing lower
levels of endogenous RICTOR (1 and 4) (Figure 3C and
3D). The effect of RICTOR overexpression on colony
formation was less pronounced in clones expressing high
levels of endogenous RICTOR (6 and 12) compared to
clones expressing low levels of endogenous RICTOR
(1 and 4) (Figure 3C and 3D). Moreover, the level of cyclin
D1 protein was proportional to the level of RICTOR in the
clones (Figure 3D) suggesting a role for RICTOR in cyclin
D1 expression and melanoma proliferation.

RICTOR controls the PI3K pathway in
melanocytes
To understand the role of RICTOR in AKT
reactivation, we overexpressed RICTOR in Melan-a.
Melan-a overexpressing RICTOR (Melan-a RICTOR)
displayed a reduced ratio of phosphorylated RICTOR over
total RICTOR and a higher level of phosphorylated AKT
at Ser473 compared to control (Figure 2A). LY294002
treatment induced similar inhibition of RICTOR Thr1135
and S6 Ser235/236 phosphorylations in Melan-a RICTOR
and control melanocytes (Figure 2D). Although LY294002
treatment induces the same level of AKT phosphorylation
inhibition in Melan-a RICTOR and in control, there
was a higher reactivation of AKT phosphorylation in
Melan-a RICTOR compared to control melanocytes
(Figure 2B). As expected, we showed that treatment with
GDC-0980, the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, led to stable
inhibition of RICTOR, S6 and AKT phosphorylations
in both Melan-a RICTOR and control (Supplementary
Figure S2). Therefore, we can assume that lower level
of phosphorylated RICTOR Thr1135 reduces the
self-regulation of the pathway and allows a stronger
reactivation of AKT Ser473. These results showed that
RICTOR overexpression disrupted the complex regulation
of the PI3K pathway and supported a role for RICTOR in a
feedback mechanism upon PI3K inhibition in melanocytes.
To investigate the biological effect of RICTOR
overexpression in melanocytes, we compared the
clonogenicity of Melan-a RICTOR to control Melan-a.
We showed that RICTOR overexpression induced a
statistically significant increase in Melan-a colony
formation (Figure 2C), demonstrating that disrupting
the PI3K pathway in melanocytes by overexpressing
RICTOR, stimulated their clonogenicity. The clonogenic

To confirm these results in human melanoma cells,
we used two NRAS mutated melanoma cell lines which
express different levels of RICTOR. We quantified the ratio
RICTOR/AKT and showed that C8161 (High-RICTOR)
expressed 6 times more RICTOR than HM11 (LowRICTOR) (Figure 4). As shown for G12VNRAS transformed
Melan-a cells, human melanoma cells expressing a high
level of RICTOR showed a higher level of phosphorylated
AKT (Figure 4). Moreover a strong reactivation of AKT
phosphorylation was seen following treatment with two
selective PI3K inhibitors in High-RICTOR cells whereas
AKT reactivation was much weaker in Low-RICTOR cells
(Figure 4). As expected, the treatment with GDC-0980, the
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, led to stable inhibition of AKT

phosphorylation in both High-RICTOR and Low-RICTOR
melanoma cells (Figure 4). These results confirmed that
RICTOR overexpression disrupts the regulation of the
PI3K pathway in human melanoma cells.

DISCUSSION
To improve currently available melanoma treatment,
we need to identify and target the melanocyte-specific
molecular and cellular events involved in the initiation
and progression of melanocytes towards melanoma. In
particular, we ought to decipher the signaling pathways,
which play a major role in melanocytes and melanoma in
order to find novel therapeutic targets. Genetics studies and

the use of small molecule inhibitors have demonstrated the
importance of the PI3K pathway in melanocytes, however,
little is known about regulation of the PI3K pathway in
these cells. We showed here that inhibition of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway induced strong inhibition of
melanocyte proliferation, highlighting the important role
of PI3K pathway in melanocytes, which has previously
been shown during melanocyte development in mouse and
Xenopus laevi [45].
Although melanocytes were very sensitive to a dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, they were less sensitive to a sole
PI3K inhibitor due to a feedback mechanism leading to
rapid reactivation of AKT. Several feedback mechanisms
have been described in the PI3K pathway and the most
studied one is the feedback mechanism associated with
rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin induced a strong
reactivation of AKT for at least 24 hours (Supplementary
Figure S3). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin down
regulates the feedback inhibition of S6K on IRS-1 an
adaptor protein activating PI3K, which will eventually
lead to AKT reactivation [40, 46]. However, in our
study with PI3K inhibitors, inhibition of PI3K prevents
this feedback mechanism to reactivate AKT. Instead, we
show that reactivation of AKT involves mTORC2 and
more precisely RICTOR, a scaffold protein which plays
an essential role in mTORC2 activity. It was described in
HEK-293, HeLa and MEF cells, that the p70 ribosomal S6
kinase (S6K), downstream of mTORC1, phosphorylates
RICTOR at Thr1135, inhibiting mTORC2 activity and
hence AKT Ser473 phosphorylation [42–44]. How
phosphorylation of RICTOR Thr1135 inhibits AKT
Ser473 phosphorylation is not yet fully understood but we
showed that AKT is linked to RICTOR in melanocytes
and that this interaction is not altered by RICTOR
Thr1135 phosphorylation. Dibles et al. have already
shown that mTORC2 assembly is not altered by RICTOR
phosphorylation but that RICTOR phosphorylated on
Thr1135 binds to 14–3-3, inducing a conformational
change that prevents mTORC2 from phosphorylating
AKT [42]. We further showed that over expression of
RICTOR in Melan-a disrupted this feedback mechanism,
enhancing AKT activation and stimulating Melan-a
clonogenicity. RICTOR overexpression also induced
resistance to a selective PI3K inhibitor. These results
suggest that this feedback mechanism is important to
restrict melanocyte proliferation and that over expression
of RICTOR could participate in melanoma progression
by enhancing the PI3K pathway. Indeed, we found that
the locus coding for RICTOR is frequently amplified in
melanoma independently of BRAF or NRAS mutations
and that RICTOR amplification in BRAF mutated
melanoma is associated with PTEN LOH. RICTOR locus
amplification is associated with a significant increase
in RICTOR mRNA expression in melanoma. Although
RICTOR overexpression was not oncogenic in Melan-a,
overexpression of RICTOR in transformed G12VNRAS
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Melan-a stimulated their clonogenicity, demonstrating
that RICTOR amplification can cooperate with NRAS
mutation to stimulate melanoma proliferation. The effect
of RICTOR on proliferation could be linked to its effect
on cyclin D1 expression as we showed that the level of
RICTOR in transformed G12VNRAS Melan-a is correlated
to the level of cyclin D1 and to cellular proliferation.
Overexpression of RICTOR in transformed G12VNRAS
Melan-a further enhanced cyclin D1 expression and
cellular proliferation. The effect of RICTOR on cyclin
D1 could be linked to its activation of AKT and the
subsequent inhibition of GSK3. GSK3 phosphorylates
cyclin D1 and induces its degradation but it is inhibited
by AKT phosphorylation. AKT activation due to RICTOR
overexpression could therefore stabilize cyclin D1 by
inhibiting its GSK3 dependent phosphorylation. Further
experiments are needed to decipher the link between
RICTOR and cyclin D1. RICTOR amplification, by
stimulating AKT phosphorylation, may also act on other
AKT effectors. Indeed, although many studies have shown
that phosphorylation of AKT at both Ser473 and Thr308
are needed for AKT full activation [47], we know now
that phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 is not needed
for mTORC1 activation and by consequence for protein
synthesis and cell growth, whereas phosphorylation of
AKT at Thr308 is essential for these activities [5]. On the
other hand, phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 is essential
for cell survival and glucose uptake [5–7, 10]. This could
explain why RICTOR overexpression in Melan-a induced
a higher number of colonies as a consequence of increased
survival rather than an enlargement of colonies, which is
a consequence of increased cell growth. In accordance
with this, Melan-a RICTOR do not display increased
proliferation compared to parental cells (data not shown).
The effect of RICTOR overexpression on clonogenicity
may also be linked to other targets independent of
mTORC2 because Melan-a RICTOR melanocytes are
more resistant than parental cells to the mTORC2 inhibitor
OSI-027. Further experiments are needed to identify
RICTOR targets involved in this process.
Our results demonstrated that RICTOR cooperates
with oncogenic NRAS by increasing AKT activation and
stimulating clonogenicity of melanoma cells. The CGH
data showing that RICTOR is also amplified in BRAF
mutated melanoma, suggest that RICTOR could also
cooperate with oncogenic BRAF. However, RICTOR
amplification is always associated with PTEN LOH in
BRAF mutated melanoma, suggesting that RICTOR
overexpression may not enhance AKT activation in the
presence of PTEN in these melanoma. This effect could be
due to the fact that V600EBRAF, but not wild type BRAF, has
been found to inhibit mTORC2 induced phosphorylation
of AKT Ser473 in the presence of PTEN [48]. However,
deletion of PTEN, activates AKT and overrides V600EBRAF
induced inhibition of AKT [48]. Therefore, if mTORC2
activity is inhibited by V600EBRAF in PTEN wild type
28127

melanoma, RICTOR overexpression will not enhance
AKT activation in these cells. In agreement with this
hypothesis, we found that RICTOR overexpression does
not enhance clonogenicity of the SkMel5 melanoma cell
lines, which is V600EBRAF mutated and PTEN wild type
(data not shown).
In conclusion, we showed that RICTOR is
responsible for an important negative feedback in
the PI3K pathway in melanocytes, restricting their
proliferation. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is
frequent in melanoma and may enhance this negative
feedback, so malignant cells will have to find a way to
override these feedback, for example by overexpressing
RICTOR. Amplification of the RICTOR locus, which is
frequently found in melanoma, disrupts this feedback
and stimulates melanocyte and melanoma proliferation.
Although we do not know yet whether RICTOR
amplification is an early or late event in melanoma
development, it is more likely to be a secondary event to
reinforce AKT pathway activation. Our results highlight
the importance of RICTOR in melanoma in agreement
with Werzowa et al., who have previously shown that
silencing of RICTOR reduced melanoma cell line
viability and increased apoptosis [41]. The same group
has shown that vertical inhibition of the PI3K pathway
leads to an enhanced reduction of melanoma tumor
growth [49]. These findings show the importance of
targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at several points
in melanoma to prevent feedback.

inhibitor and OSI-027, mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor,
were obtained from Selleckchem.

Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 5 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10
μg ml−1 leupeptin and 10 μg ml−1 aprotinin. 20–25 μg of
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and western blot
analysis was carried out according to standard protocols
using the following antibodies: phosphoAKT (ser473)
XP, phosphoAKT (thr308), AKT, phosphoRICTOR
(thr1135), RICTOR, phosphoS6 (ser235/236; Cell
Signaling Technology) and Actin (Abcam). Proteins were
revealed and quantified with SuperSignal® West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) on an
ImageQuant imaging system or by fluorescence on an
Odyssey imaging system.

Cell culture
Melan-a cell line, a non transformed mouse
melanocyte line that retains many of the characteristics
of normal melanocytes [50] was cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS;
Perbio), L-glutamin (2 mM; Invitrogen), antibiotics
(100 U/ml penicillin and 1000 μg/ml streptomycin;
Invitrogen), 100 nM TPA (Sigma), and 200 pM cholera
toxin (Sigma). NHEMs (Promo Cell) were cultured in
KBM-Gold medium containing 0.5% serum and SCF
(Lonza).
For ex vivo culture, Melan-a cells and NHEMs
both require ERK signaling to stimulate proliferation and
cAMP signaling to maintain their differentiated phenotype.

Proximity ligation assay
After treatment with inhibitors or DMSO cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then
permeabilized with 0, 5% Triton X100. DuoLink assay
(OLINK BIOSCIENCE) was performed according to
manufacturer instructions using AKT and RICTOR
antibodies.

generation. Cell. 2011; 144:646–674.

We utilized previously obtained CGH array data
from 44 cell lines and corresponding peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine copy number
changes at the RICTOR and PTEN loci [51]. A 2.6
Mb region covering 236 SNPs in RICTOR gene locus
(Chr 5:37,845,789–40,490,831) and a 2.1 Mb region
covering 150 SNPs in PTEN locus (Chr 10:88,570,
230–90,707,272) were analyzed for amplifications and
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) between the three groups
of cell lines that contained either BRAF, NRAS mutations
or did not carry mutations in either of the two genes. Pair
wise copy number (CN) analysis and LOH at the RICTOR
and PTEN loci was carried out using chromosome copy
number analysis tool (CNAT 4.0, Affymetrix). The copy
number data was exported into Excel (see supplementary
data) and SNPs that showed > 2 copies were colored red
(amplifications) and the SNPs < 2 were colored green
(LOH). Chi-square test was carried out between cell lines
without mutations and cell lines with either BRAF or
NRAS mutations for amplifications at RICTOR and LOH
at PTEN loci.

RNA was extracted from short term melanoma
cultures and reverse transcribed. RICTOR expression
levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR.
PCR reactions were done in duplicate using the Power
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Bio­
systems) following the manufacturer’s instructions, using
forward (CCGTGTCGGAGGTTCATACA) and reverse
(GCCTCTGCTTCTTCATGCATT) RICTOR primers
and forward (TGGGTGTGAACCATGAGAAGTATG)
and reverse (GGTGCAGGAGGCATTGCT) GADPH
primers, a housekeeping gene used as an internal
standard. RICTOR expression levels were calculated
using GADPH expression as a reference and relative
quantification was performed using the ΔΔ Ct method and
log2 transformation.
