BACKGROUND: Targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is of
increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy in many tumors. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers associated with
mTOR inhibitor activity in women with metastatic endometrial cancer. METHODS: Archival tumor samples were collected from 94
women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer who participated in 3 National Cancer Insitute of Canada Clinical Trials Group
phase 2 trials investigating single-agent mTOR inhibitors: IND160A and IND160B (temsirolimus) and IND192 (ridaforolimus). Analyses
included mutational profiling using the OncoCarta Panel version 1.0 and immunohistochemical expression of the tumor suppressor
gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and stathmin, a marker of PI3K activation. Associations between biomarker results
and clinical outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 32 of 73 analyzed tumors, PIK3CA (21 patients) was the
most common mutated gene. Co-mutations were seen in 8 tumors, most frequently KRAS and PIK3CA (4 cases). PTEN loss was
observed in 46 of 85 samples analyzed and increased stathmin expression was observed in 15 of 65 analyzed samples. No correlation
was observed between biomarkers and response or progression. In patients taking concurrent metformin, there was a trend toward
lower progression, of 11.8% versus 32.5% (P 5.14). CONCLUSIONS: No predictive biomarker or combination of biomarkers for mTOR
inhibitor activity were identified in this study. Restriction and enrichment of study entry, especially based on archival tumor tissue,

INTRODUCTION
Targeting the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/serine-threonine kinase (PI3K) mammalian AKT target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway (Fig. 1) has emerged as an interesting potential therapeutic strategy in many cancers.1-3 Rapalogs, a class
of agents which partially inhibit mTORC1 (part of the MTOR complex), demonstrate clinical activity and generally
favorable toxicity profiles.1-3 Agents from this class have been approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma2 and mantle-cell lymphoma.3 The clinical benefit associated with rapalogs, as with other pathway-targeting agents,
is typically limited to a subset of patients. It has been suggested that patients who benefit from drugs that inhibit the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway can be identified by specific protein expression and genomic mutational profiles.5,6 As a result,
efforts to stratify, and even preselect, patients receiving treatment with mTOR (and PI3K) inhibitors based on specific biomarkers, with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes, has not only been proposed but is being incorporated into many
clinical trial designs.
Women with locally advanced recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer are incurable and have a poor
prognosis.7-13 Hormonal agents, used in the most common type of endometrial cancer (type I or those with endometrioid
histology), have modest efficacy and median survival is short, 7 to 12 months.7-11 Combination chemotherapy regimens
produce objective response rates of approximately 50% to 60% but are often poorly tolerated by a predominantly older
population and overall survival is short.12,13 Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Fig. 1) is a frequent event in
endometrial cancers. Loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes including phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)

occurs in more than 50% of patients.14,15 In addition, loss
of tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC1 and TSC2 (13%)
and LKB are frequently occurring events.16 Activating
mutations and amplification of PIK3CA, predominantly
in the catalytic subunit p110a, occur in 36% of
tumors.17,18 Mutations in other pathway members
including AKT are also common. Inhibitors of this pathway have thus been of interest to evaluate in endometrial
cancer.
Between May 2004 and June 2007, 94 women were
enrolled in 3, sequential studies conducted by the
National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group (NCIC CTG). IND160A and IND160B trials
investigated the intravenous (IV) rapalog temsirolimus in
women who were either chemotherapy-naive (IND160A)
or who had received 1 prior line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (IND160B).1 IND192 investigated the
rapalog ridaforolimus in a similar population of women,
allowing prior adjuvant chemotherapy as part of eligibility
criteria.19 All 3 studies shared a common primary endpoint (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
[RECIST]-evaluated response rate [RR]). All patients
were treated to progression, and response was evaluated
every 8 weeks (Fig. 2). None of the studies preselected
patients based on histological or biomarker profile, and
access to archival tissue (taken at the time of diagnosis)
was required for study entry. Overall, single-agent mTOR
inhibition showed promising activity in endometrial cancer. The 18% rate of progression observed in IND160A

was the lowest seen in endometrial cancer studies. Many
patients had prolonged stable disease (SD), of 69% over 9
months.1,19
Use of the oral antihyperglycemic metformin has
been proposed as having anticancer properties and is currently being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical
trials as an anticancer agent. Metformin is associated with
the activation of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)kinase pathway and the suppression of mTOR and S6 kinase (S6K) activation.20 Diabetes is a common diagnosis
in women with endometrial cancer. For that reason, we
were interested to see if patients in whom metformin was
being given at the time of initiation of rapalog therapy
had any evidence of greater clinical activity.
We had previously examined immunohistochemical

and nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), and

phosphorylated S6, in archival tumor tissue from patients
enrolled on IND160A and IND160B, but no correlations
between these markers and outcome were seen.1 In this
report, we have pooled the cases from all 3 trials to undertake further studies including mutational analyses, using
the OncoCarta version 1.0 panel (Sequenom, San Diego,
Calif) and IHC measures of stathmin. This larger data set,
which also includes PTEN expression and clinicopathological variables, was then used to explore associations
between multiple molecular and other baseline measures
with response and nonprogression to mTOR inhibitor
therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Diagnostic archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor samples from patients participating in
closed NCIC CTG studies with temsirolimus, IND160A
and IND160B and with ridaforolimus IND192 were
obtained. All samples underwent specialist (B.C.) pathological review. Sequenom mutational analysis, expression
of stathmin, and expression of PTEN was undertaken on
available tissue. All these studies had full ethics board approval at each of the participating institutions, and
patients signed written informed consent before study
entry, which included use of tissue samples.
Mutational Analysis (OncoCarta, Version 1)

The OncoCarta Panel version 1.0 (Sequenom) consists of
24 multiplexed assays, and can detect 238 mutations in
19 oncogenes: ABL-1, AKT1, AKT2, BRAF, CDK-4,
EGFR, ERBB2, MET, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PDGFRa,
PIK3CA, RET, FGFR1, FGFR3, JAK-2, KIT, and
FLT3. A total of 10 to 20 ng of input DNA was used in
each of 24 assays. In order to analyze the mutation status
of each patient’s tumor, 5 to 10 unstained sections and
one hematoxylin and eosin slide were generated from the
most representative paraffin block containing tumor. All
tissue samples were reviewed by a pathologist who identified areas of tumor on the hematoxylin and eosin slide.
This area was then macrodissected to ensure enrichment
for tumor DNA. After macrodissection, tissues were
deparaffinized with xylene then treated with proteinase K
treatment prior to DNA extraction. DNAs were amplified
using the OncoCarta PCR primer mix, and a single base
extension reaction performed using extension primers
that hybridize immediately adjacent to the mutation.
Multiplexed reactions were spotted onto a chip and peaks
with different mass resolved by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) on a
Mass Array Compact Analyzer. Mutation calling was

determined by using data generated from Typer Analyzer
software as well as manual analysis. Our laboratory is a
CAP/CLIA-certified laboratory. We are thus very familiar
with the use and limitations of this technology. Other
mutations to be evaluated using this platform include
KRAS, NRAS, MET, PIK3CA, AKT1/2 beta catenin,
and p10 recurrent mutations. All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
PTEN Immunohistochemistry

FFPE tissue sections from archival surgical blocks were
dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol
to water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked in 3%
hydrogen peroxide. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was
carried out in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 in a Milestone
T/T Mega microwave oven. After blocking for endogenous biotin (Vector Laboratories) sections were incubated
in primary antibody (anti-PTEN, rabbit monoclonal
from Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200 dilution) for 16
hours at room temperature in a moist chamber. Following
washing in phosphate-buffered saline, secondary incubations were carried out in biotin conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (Vector Laboratories) and streptavidin-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (ID Labs Inc.) for 30 minutes each.
Immunoreactivities were revealed by incubation in
NovaRed substrate (Vector Laboratories) for 5 minutes.
Slides were counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin and
mounted with Permount.
Tumor cells were scored for PTEN immunoreactivity based on predominant staining intensity and percentage of tumor cells showing staining by 2 independent
observers. Tumors were scored as PTEN-negative when
there was complete absence of nuclear or cytoplasmic
staining in the tumor cells, and positive staining in
stroma, lymphocytes, or normal endometrial cells present
in the same section.
Stathmin Immunohistochemistry

Antigen retrieval was done by microwaves for 20 minutes
in TRS at pH 6. Slides were blocked for peroxidase (Dako
S2032) for 8 minutes and incubated for 60 minutes at
room temperature with a polyclonal Stathmin antibody
(3352 Cell Signaling Technology), diluted 1:50. Staining
procedures were carried out manually. The Envision1rabbit HRP-labeled polymer method was used for
adding secondary antibody as recommended by DakoCytomation. Finally, slides were briefly counterstained with
Dako Real Hematoxylin. Samples were blinded and
scored as previously described using a staining index calculated as the product of staining intensity and staining

area, range 5 0-9: incorporating staining intensity (score
0-3) and area of tumor with positive staining (0, no staining; 1, < 10%; 2, 10%-50%, and 3, > 50% of tumor
cells) and the index was categorized as no staining 5 0;
weak 5 0-3; moderate 5 3-6; or strong positive 5 6-9.
Applying 6-9 as cutoff for stathmin overexpression, interobservation k was 0.73.21
Statistical Analysis

This study was hypothesis-generating, and Fisher’s exact
test was used to assess the correlation between the results
of the various mutational and expression assays, tumor
grade, and histologic type with clinical outcome. For the
clinical outcome variable, we examined both response versus nonresponse and progression versus nonprogression as
dependent variables. Comparisons included only those
patients who were evaluable for the molecular test result.
RESULTS
Ninety-four tumor samples were obtained from patients
enrolled in IND160A (33 patients), IND160B (27
patients), and IND192 (34 patients). Because of quality
and quantity of FFPE tissue submitted and minimal assay
requirements, not all analyses could be performed in all
94 cases. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2B, mutational
analysis was available from 73 patient samples, PTEN
IHC from 85, and stathmin IHC from 65 patient samples. Central pathological review was available for 93
patient samples. Patient characteristics are also shown in
Table 1. For the purpose of this report, a combined database of all 3 trials was created which included all baseline
and treatment variables, study toxicity information and
treatment, and best independent radiology-reviewed
RECIST response. In the combined data set, the overall
confirmed response rate was 8.5% (8 patients); SD was
seen in 53% (50 patients) and progressive disease (PD) in
29% (27 patients). The median duration of SD was 6.6
months (range, 2.2-24 months).
Mutational Analysis and Outcome

Mutations were identified in 32 (43.8%) of the 73 patient
samples analyzed. Mutations most commonly occurred in
PIK3CA (21 patients), where 7 different activating mutations were seen, followed by KRAS (10 patients) (Table
2). Co-mutations were observed in 9 tumor samples, and
8 patients with PIK3CA mutations also had mutations in
other genes (Table 2). No significant association was seen
between the presence (or absence) of mutation or with
specific gene mutations and either response or progression
(Table 2). Because PIK3CA mutations were of particular

of mutations observed compared to best tumor response
for all analyzed patients. Figure 3B illustrates duration of
therapy in relation to PIK3CA mutation and in relation

PTEN Expression and Outcome

Forty-six (54.1%) of the 85 evaluable patient samples
examined had lost expression of PTEN (Fig. 4A,B). There
was no association between response (P 5 .46) or progression (P 5 .35) and loss of PTEN expression as shown in
Table 3.
Stathmin Expression and Outcome

Twenty-three patients (35.3%) of the 65 patient samples
examined had weak (21 patients) or no (2 patients) staining for stathmin, 27 (41.5%) were moderately positive,
and 15 (23.1%) had strong positive staining for stathmin.

DISCUSSION
This is the largest comprehensive analysis of samples
obtained from patients with endometrial cancer who were
enrolled in single-agent rapalog studies. Patients were followed in a uniform manner, and tissue was available from
nearly all cases. Analysis of tissue for previously documented activating mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and the related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway together with PTEN loss and stathmin, a suggested surrogate marker of PI3K activation and PTEN
loss, were performed. Robust assays were used and analyses were conducted in CAP/CLIA-certified laboratories.
Mutations were found in 43.8% of evaluable patient samples, and mutation in PIK3CA was the most commonly
identified (28.8% of evaluable patients). PTEN expression was lost in 54% of evaluable patients and strong
staining for stathmin seen in 23.1% of evaluable cases.

Of patients in each group

These data are consistent with previously reported findings in endometrial cancer.14-18
Although the study included only 94 patients and
between 65 and 85 samples were analyzed for the markers
of interest, we would have 80% power to detect, at a
2-sided 5% significance level, a difference in response rate
(RR) between 35% and 40% among 2 marker subgroups
when the RR in the group with lower response is approximately 10% or a difference in PD rate approximately
30% when the lowest PD rate in the groups is approximately 20%. Despite this, and despite the large number of
biologically plausible markers studied, not one showed a
significant association with treatment outcome.
Co-mutations are common in endometrial cancer.23,24 Simultaneous mutations in PIK3CA and the
MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS) have been proposed as
mediators of resistance to mTOR (and PI3K) inhibitors.4,5 In our study, coexisting mutations occurred in 9
tumor samples. The most common co-mutations were in
PIK3CA and KRAS, with one mutation occurring in
NRAS. Figure 3B suggests that although PIK3CA/KRAS
mutations do appear to occur in the lower half of the plot,
where duration of therapy is shorter, there is a range and
not all patients appear to be demonstrating resistance.
Increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors has been proposed for tumors with PIK3CA mutations which have
lost PTEN expression.25 In our series, although the
patient with the PIK3CA mutation who remained on
treatment for the longest period (96.3 months) had lost
PTEN expression, there did not appear to be any noticea608

ble pattern in the other patients. These observations are
limited by the fact that duration of therapy may not reflect
treatment effect but underlying tumor biology. There
have been suggestions that a combination of a genetic
defect (PIK3CA mutation or PTEN mutation/loss) and a
functional output (pAKT, pMTOR, or pS6 for example)
might be more reliable in identifying a predictive signature. Previously, in a limited subset of patients, we failed
to identify an association between outcome and pAKT,
pmTOR, or pS6.1 There are, however, limitations in
examining phosphoprotein expression in archival FFPE
samples. Ideally, these types of analyses would be performed on fresh tissue collected under rigorously controlled conditions. In terms of this article, we are also
aware of the risks inherent in “overanalyzing” our data
given that multiple testing is likely, by chance, to produce
a significant result.
PIK3CA mutations appear to cluster in patients
showing a reduction in tumor size (Fig. 3A) but this did
not, however, necessarily translate into a clear relationship
between mutational status and RECIST defined response
or nonprogression. Rapalogs are incomplete MTORC1
inhibitors and lead to activation of AKT and other pathways potentially allowing escape from the growth inhibitory effects of the drug.26
These analyses were conducted on archival, diagnostic samples. Although this has been a successful strategy in
some tumor types,27-31 the possibility of discordance
between the mutational and proteomic profiles of tumor
samples taken at diagnosis and recurrence exists. A change
in stathmin expression was reported for 31% of paired endometrial tumor samples taken at diagnosis and recurrence.27 It is therefore possible that stathmin expression
might correlate with response if analyzed in samples taken
just prior to treatment. However, stathmin expression
does not correlate with PIK3CA mutation in this analysis.. To optimize the potential for future correlative
research, clinical trials should be designed incorporating
tumor sampling prior to commencing a new therapy, and
preferably sequential specimen collection during treatment and at the time of progression. Furthermore, recent
data suggest that the search for predictive (and potentially
prognostic) biomarkers may be further complicated not
only by temporal but also by spatial tumoral heterogeneity.28 This potentially poses even greater challenges when
designing and evaluating, tissue based, biomarker studies.
Although extensive, our interrogation of the genome
in these samples was not all inclusive. The PIK3CA mutations included in the OncoCarta panel encompass the
commonly found mutations in the catalytic p110a

subunit. However, it does not include some of the less frequently occurring mutations in P110a or those occurring
in the regulatory subunit p85. A small number of the samples, therefore, may have been misclassified as nonmutated when in fact a mutation existed that was not
evaluated as part of the panel. Whole-genome sequencing
would almost certainly have yielded more findings of
mutations within molecular components of the PI3K or
ras/raf/MEK pathways, but would also have brought
greater complexity in terms of analysis.
Stathmin expression in this study was not associated
with either PIK3CA mutations or clinical outcomes. Clinical trials of PI3K inhibitors are evaluating potential preselection of patients based on mutation status and stathmin
expression in archival tissue. Our data suggest this may be
premature.
Seventeen women in our study reported that they
took metformin while participating in these trials. No statistically significant association of response or nonprogression
with metformin use was seen; however, the observed results
showed a numerically lower proportion of metformin users
versus nonusers with a best response of progression (11.8%
versus 32.5%, respectively) (Table 3), suggesting that further investigation is warranted. Numbers, however, were
low and metformin use was self-reported, so these results
should be interpreted with caution.
Identifying patients who may (or more importantly
may not) benefit from a specific therapeutic strategy or
molecularly targeted agent is conceptually very attractive.
Proof of principle for this approach comes from a number
of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer (KRAS mutations and lack of efficacy of EGFR-targeting agents),28
and lung cancer (EML4-ALK translocations and response
to ALK inhibitors.27 These markers have been identified
in archival tissue. This approach may not be successful for
all targeted agents and may in fact only apply to a minority. Agents targeting pathways with pleiotropic interactions and effects such as those targeting the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway not only have direct effects within tumor
cells but effect angiogenesis, immune response and other
tumor microenvironment interactions. It is therefore possible that there may not be a single (or even double) biomarker of sensitivity but rather a predictive molecular
signature. It is imperative that future trials incorporate
high quality correlative studies to explore this. Continued
longitudinal profiling will be essential to further improve
our understanding of the basis for mechanisms of drug resistance and response.
The ability to use genetic or proteomic markers to
identify which patients will most (or least) benefit from

molecularly targeted drugs is key if we are to optimize and
rationalize the use of the plethora of agents currently
entering the clinic. However, it is vital that we recognize
that “what we think we know” is not always what there is
to know about these pathways, the tumor (and its environment) or the action of the agents that target them.
While continuing to investigate strategies to predict
response, it is important that restricting trial entry based
on existing biological hypotheses should be done with
extreme caution.
