Abstract
The human epidermal receptor (HER) axis consists of a dynamic, interconnected family of receptors that
make critical contributions to a number of malignancies. Therapeutics targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are unable to effectively inhibit tumor growth in a majority of cases. These tumors are assumed
to possess primary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies, but the consequence of inhibiting EGFR in these tumors
is unclear. We established isogenic cell lines by prolonged gefitinib treatment at concentrations that are in
excess of that which is required for complete EGFR kinase inhibition but only minimally affected growth.
Subsequently, we monitored the ligand-dependent HER profiles based on receptor expression, phosphorylation, and dimerization in conjunction with measurements of cellular susceptibility to gefitinib. Chronic EGFR
kinase inhibition rapidly switched the HER network from dependence on EGFR to HER2. However, both receptors activated the critical signaling proteins AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase, and in both cases,
HER3 was the common association partner. Remarkably, the switch in receptor dimers caused diminished
susceptibility to EGFR-targeted inhibitors gefitinib and cetuximab but acquired susceptibility to the HER2targeted inhibitor pertuzumab. Overall, our study indicates that the EGFR pathway is responsive to EGFR
inhibiting therapies that are not dependent on EGFR for their growth and survival, thus challenging the current definition of primary therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, EGFR kinase inhibition induces HER kinase
receptors to engage in alternative dimerization that can ultimately influence therapeutic selection and responsiveness. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1989–99. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The human epidermal receptor (HER) axis is a dynamic,
interconnected family of receptors that can form receptor
complexes that activate both common and distinct downstream signaling events critical for cell growth and proliferation. It includes four structurally related receptors: HER1
[epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)], HER2,
HER3, and HER4. These receptors are activated in response
to ligand-dependent dimerization that initiates key signaling pathways to cellular proliferation, including the rat

sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathways. However, receptor
hyperactivation due to overexpression (1), amplification (2, 3),
or activating mutations (4) can cause aberrant cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis.
Constitutively active receptors, such as EGFR or HER2,
when overexpressed and/or deregulated, can trigger potent
signaling events that confer a selective growth advantage
and can lead to tumorigenesis. However, sustained activation
also causes cell dependence on individual signaling pathways. This phenomenon, called “oncogene addiction” (5),
predicts targets for directed therapeutics, as inhibition of
the target oncogene effectively inhibits cellular proliferation.
This is exemplified by tumors overexpressing HER2 that can
be inhibited by the HER2-directed antibody trastuzumab (6),
as well as EGFR-expressing tumors that are inhibited by
EGFR–tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; i.e., erlotinib and gefitinib) or EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab
and panitumumab). However, efficacy for both of these targeted inhibitors is limited to a subset of patients. Although
there are some controversies concerning the measurement of
HER2 amplification in breast cancers by both standard immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) techniques (7), it is conventionally accepted that
trastuzumab is only effective in a subset of breast cancers

(8), those with elevated HER2 expression as assessed by
these diagnostic assays. Similarly EGFR-TKIs are most effective in non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors,
in which EGFR is hyperactivated due to gene amplification, kinase domain–activating mutations (9–12), EGFR ligand overexpression (13), or activation by non-HER family
members (14, 15).
Upon chronic treatment “oncogene-addicted” tumors become resistant to HER-targeted therapeutics. However, tumors are heterogeneous tissues, and it is plausible that
there is diversity for therapeutic susceptibility within a tumor. As such, it is expected that both oncogene-addicted
and nonaddicted cells will be exposed to targeted therapies.
The oncogene-addicted cells may undergo apoptosis via the
recently explained mechanism of “oncogenic shock” (16),
whereas the nonaddicted cells may remain viable. Eventually oncogene-addicted cells acquire resistance against
the targeted therapeutic through readjustment of signaling
networks (17–19), HER reprogramming (20, 21), and acquisition of secondary mutations (22, 23). In contrast, the effect of HER-targeted therapies in the nonaddicted cells
that express HER family targets at functional, but not hyperactive, levels has not been thoroughly evaluated. These
nonaddicted cells may harbor de novo or primary resistance; however, it is unclear if the HER network in these cells
undergoes modulation in response to HER-targeted therapies. Recent studies have shown that, although trastuzumab
is ineffective at altering the growth properties of cells that
express normal levels of HER2, it causes a shift in HER
family expression (24). We queried whether a similar phenomenon occurs in normal EGFR-expressing cells in response
to EGFR-TKIs.
We have developed isogenic cell lines that are not dependent on EGFR for cell survival to evaluate HER family interactions that are important for EGFR-TKI sensitivity. We have
shown that, whereas cellular proliferation is only moderately
affected by prolonged exposure to supraphysiologic gefitinib
concentrations, otherwise known to compromise viability of
gefitinib-sensitive, EGFR-expressing cells (25), in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (22Rv1), the HER family receptor profile was profoundly altered. These gefitinib
concentrations were shown previously to rapidly select for
gefitinib-resistant cells (25). In response to gefitinib, there
is a shift in the HER axis, and as EGFR expression is downregulated, HER2 expression is upregulated. In parallel, liganddependent receptor association patterns are altered and
switch from primarily EGFR-containing dimers to HER2HER3 heterodimers. Whereas MAPK activation is not altered
by gefitinib exposure, AKT is less efficiently activated by
EGF-dependent EGFR homodimers but is activated more
readily by heregulin β1 (HRGβ1)–dependent HER2-HER3
heterodimers. Ultimately, cells harboring these receptor profile alterations become susceptible to the HER2 heterodimerinhibiting antibody pertuzumab (2C4). Our results show that
EGFR-TKI treatment targets EGFR even in cells that are
de novo resistant to EGFR-TKIs and causes a shift in HER
axis signaling, potentially “priming” cells for susceptibility
to alternative HER-targeting strategies.

Materials and Methods
All experiments were performed at least thrice. Representative data are shown.
Cell Lines and Tissue Culture
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (American Type Culture
Collection) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Omega Scientific), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen),
and 1% glutamine (Invitrogen).
Gefitinib selection of 20GS. 22Rv1 cells were serially passaged in 20 μmol/L gefitinib (a gift from AstraZeneca) for
∼4 mo until single-cell clones were obtained.
Stable transfection of 20GS. 20GS cells were transiently
transfected with pEGFP-NI-EGFR (a gift from Alexander Sorkin; ref. 26) using Effectene (Qiagen). Single-cell clones were
selected in presence of G418 and maintained in 200 μg/mL
G418. Clonal populations were analyzed for EGFR expression,
and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was done for green
fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. GFP-positive population was labeled as 20GS-EGFR.
Ligand and drug treatments. Cells were serum-starved
overnight in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 containing 0.1%
charcoal-stripped FBS and supplements incubated with
drugs [gefitinib, cetuximab (obtained from Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center pharmacy), or 2C4 (pertuzumab, gift from
Genentech)] at the indicated concentrations at 37°C for
2 h before ligand addition. Ligands were 30 nmol/L HRG
(R&D Systems) at 37°C, 10 min or 4 nmol/L EGF (Invitrogen)
at 37°C, 5 min.
Cell viability assays. Cells were treated with drugs and/or
ligands at the indicated concentrations for 5 d at 37°C. Cell
viability was assessed using the ATPlite 1step Luminescence
Assay (Perkin-Elmer).
Western Blotting
Immunoblots were performed, as described previously
(27). Antibodies used were phosphorylated MAPK p44/42
(#9101), phosphorylated HER3 (Y1289; #4791), phosphorylated
EGFR (Y1068; #2236), phosphorylated AKT (#9271), EGFR
(#2232), AKT (#9272; Cell Signaling), HER3 (Neomarkers
MS-201), ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin
(Sigma).
Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription–PCR
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–PCR methods were performed, as described previously
(27), using gene-specific primers (900 nmol/L each) and probe
(250 nmol/L) from Applied Biosystems. Samples were analyzed
using the ΔΔCt method and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Animal Studies
All experiments were conducted under CSMC Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approval. Single-cell tumor
suspensions were filtered, incubated for 5 min in RBC lysis
buffer (Sigma), and washed in 1× PBS. Cell pellets resuspended

shown by increased EGFR phosphorylation and activation
of both MAPK and AKT, the downstream molecular correlates of cell proliferation and survival (Fig. 1C). Moreover,
EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited with
low doses (0.1 μmol/L) of the reversible EGFR-TKI, gefitinib.
Phosphorylated AKT and MAPK were also inhibited with 1
and 10 μmol/L of gefitinib, respectively. Also, supporting
the presence of a functional EGFR signaling pathway,
22Rv1 xenograft tumors s.c. grown in immunodeficient nude
mice show ∼50% tumor growth inhibition in the presence of
100 mg/kg gefitinib (Fig. 1D). However, it should be noted
that the gefitinib-mediated inhibition in tumor growth
shown in this system is significantly lower compared with
systems that either have gene-amplified EGFR or EGFR mutations, such as in NSCLC. These analyses show that the
22Rv1 cell line harbors a functional EGFR pathway that is efficiently inhibited with gefitinib, but the effect on growth and
survival is minimal. Therefore, the 22Rv1 cell line can serve as
a model to study the apparent disconnect between sensitivity
to EGFR-TKIs and the presence of its target, EGFR.
Chronic exposure to gefitinib downregulates EGFR and
upregulates HER2. To evaluate the role of EGFR and whether the other HER kinase axis receptors contribute to the failure of gefitinib to inhibit growth of 22Rv1 cells, cells were
treated with gefitinib concentrations reported to kill cells expressing either wild-type or mutant EGFR, with the exception
of those that grow as gefitinib-resistant colonies (25). Chronic exposure to 20 μmol/L gefitinib rapidly selected for 22Rv1
cell clones (20GS) that no longer exhibited the limited responsiveness to gefitinib, as previously measured in vivo as
xenograft tumors (Fig. 2A). The expression pattern of the
HER kinases was altered in the 20GS cell line both at the level
of mRNA (Fig. 2B) and protein (Fig. 2C). EGFR mRNA was reduced ∼100-fold, HER2 mRNA was increased ∼2-fold, and
HER3 mRNA remained constant. EGFR-specific ligands, EGF,
and TGF-α mRNA levels were increased 10-fold, possibly compensating for reduced EGFR expression (data not shown).
As chronic exposure of cells to gefitinib resulted in reduced EGFR expression (as seen in the 20GS line), recombinant EGFR was stably reintroduced into the 20GS cells
generating the 20GS-EGFR cells. The 20GS-EGFR cell line expressed EGFR at ∼25% the level (based both on mRNA and
protein expression) of the parental 22Rv1 cells (Fig. 2B and
C). Reintroduction of EGFR in the 20GS cell line did not alter
HER2 and HER3 receptor levels. Protein expression of the
HERs in 22Rv1, 20GS, and 20GS-EGFR cells was verified using
the VeraTag assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). The relative receptor protein expression in the three 22Rv1 cell lines was
in concordance with the mRNA measurements (Fig. 2B).
However, modified HER kinase expression patterns in the
cell lines caused only minor modifications in the cellular response to gefitinib (Fig. 2D). As expected, downregulation of
the primary molecular target for gefitinib, EGFR, led to decreased sensitivity to high doses of gefitinib in the 20GS cell
line and interestingly conferred a growth advantage at gefitinib concentrations sufficient for inhibition of EGFR signaling.
Reintroduction of EGFR in the 20GS cells (20GS-EGFR) was
sufficient to restore gefitinib sensitivity that paralleled the

in 50% RPMI 1640/50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected s.c. into female nude mice (Taconic Labs) right flank
at ∼2 to 10 × 106 cells per animal.
Gefitinib tablets were ground, resuspended in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.5% Tween 80, and given p.o. 5× a week (100 mg/kg
animal body weight). 2C4 was given i.p. 2× a week at 20 mg/kg
body weight. The control group received vehicle alone. Treatments typically started 3 to 6 d after tumor implantation. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week with a digital
vernier caliper and calculated as π/6 × larger diameter ×
(smaller diameter)2. The data represent three to four experiments of 8 to 10 mice per group, with mice distributed randomly between control and treated groups.
Statistical Analysis
We used a Box-Cox transformation (28) of the tumor volume to account for the nonnormality of the distributions, and
statistical significance of the treatment effect was tested by a
two-sided t test. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
The analyses were performed using the R software package.5
VeraTag Lysate HER Assays
VeraTag lysate assays were performed using the VeraTag
technology (29). These proximity-based assays were used to
measure HER protein complexes using tagged receptor-specific antibodies combined with photo-activated cleavage. The
detailed protocol is described in the supplementary data.
Monoclonal antibodies were purchased from various sources:
EGFR-Ab11, EGFR-Ab5, HER2-Ab5, HER2-Ab4, and HER3Ab7 (Lab Vision); HER3-1B4C3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
and PT100 (Cell Signaling Technology). Optimized antibody
concentrations were as follows: EGFR multiplex assay: all
antibodies at 0.3 μg/mL; HER2 multiplex assay: HER2 Ab5biotin at 1 μg/mL, EGFR Ab11-Pro10 and HER3 Ab7-Pro99
at 0.2 μg/mL, HER2 Ab4-Pro14 and PT100-Pro2 at 0.1 μg/mL;
HER3 multiplex assay: HER3 1B4C3-biotin at 2 μg/mL, EGFR
Ab11-Pro10 and HER2 Ab4-Pro14 at 0.2 μg/mL, HER3 Ab7Pro99 and PT100-Pro2 at 0.1 μg/mL. Results are represented
as slopes ± SEM expressed as relative peak area (RPA) per
milligram of input protein. The statistical significance of
different slopes was generated by linear regression analysis
using GraphPad prism software.

Results
Gefitinib blocks EGFR activation and signaling, but cell
proliferation is only moderately inhibited. The 22Rv1 cell
line expresses a functional EGFR pathway. EGFR is the most
highly expressed receptor at the mRNA level, whereas HER3
is expressed ∼5-fold less and HER2 and HER4 are barely detectable (Fig. 1A). These cells express modest levels of the
EGFR-specific ligands, transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), amphiregulin, and β-cellulin. In contrast, EGF and
HRGβ1 were not detected (Fig. 1B). The EGFR pathway in
22Rv1 cells is efficiently activated by exogenous EGF, as

parental 22Rv1 cell line (Fig. 2D). However, growth inhibition
by gefitinib was minimal for all of the cell lines with only
some decrease in growth seen at very high gefitinib doses.
Chronic EGFR kinase inhibition modulates HER liganddependent signaling. Chronic exposure to gefitinib altered
EGFR and HER2 gene expression. As low doses of gefitinib
effectively inhibited EGF-dependent signaling in the parental
22Rv1 cells (Fig. 1C), we investigated whether changes in the
HER kinase axis also altered EGFR- and HER2-driven signaling pathways. All cell lines (22Rv1, 20GS, and 20GS-EGFR)
were growth factor starved and stimulated with either EGF
or HRGβ1 in the presence or absence of gefitinib to assess
downstream signaling.
The level of EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, measured by either Western blot using phosphorylated sitespecific antibodies or proximity-based pan-phosphorylated
antibodies using VeraTag assays, correlated directly with
EGFR expression in all cell lines (Fig. 3A and B). Further-

more, EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in a dosedependent manner that was detected between 10 and
100 nmol/L of gefitinib as measured by Western blotting
(Fig. 3A) or at 100 nmol/L using VeraTag assays (Fig. 3B).
EGF-dependent AKT activation correlated with both EGFR
expression and phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). AKT was activated
by EGF in 22Rv1 cells and was undetectable in 20GS cells,
but AKT activation was restored by the reintroduction of
recombinant EGFR in 20GS-EGFR cells. The VeraTag assay
corroborated these observations (Fig. 3C). EGF-dependent
phosphorylated AKT signals in both 22Rv1 and 20GS-EGFR
cells were inhibited with comparable doses of gefitinib
(Fig. 3A). These observations indicate a direct role for EGFR
expression in modulating EGF-dependent phosphorylated
AKT signaling that correlates with response to gefitinib.
In contrast, HRGβ1-stimulated phosphorylated AKT was
detectable in all cell lines consistent with similar HER3
expression (Fig. 3C and D). However, HRGβ1-stimulated

phosphorylated AKT was four to five times greater in 20GS
and 20GS-EGFR relative to 22Rv1 (Fig. 3C and D). This directly paralleled HRGβ1-mediated HER3 phosphorylation
(Fig. 3D). Furthermore, a log-fold greater gefitinib concentration of 100 nmol/L was necessary to partially inhibit HRGβ1stimulated HER3 phosphorylation and phosphorylated AKT
in the 20GS and 20GS-EGFR cells compared with the 22Rv1
cell line. These differences could be due to higher HER2 expression in the 20GS and 20GS-EGFR cells, gefitinib crossreactivity with HER2 (30, 31), or possibly increased HER2
sensitivity to gefitinib in HER2-overexpressing cells (32). An
analysis of the EGFR, HER2, and HER3 phosphorylation
patterns in the presence of HRGβ1 stimulation combined with
gefitinib inhibition revealed that HER2 phosphorylation was
indeed inhibited with 100 nmol/L gefitinib (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Furthermore, gene-specific knockdown of HER2, but
not EGFR, in 20GS cells downregulated HRGβ1-mediated

HER3, AKT, and MAPK phosphorylation signals showing a role
for HER2 in gefitinib-selected cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
EGFR and HER2 expression levels influence both HER
kinase receptor phosphorylation and dimerization. As
distinctive receptor profiles were identified in response to
chronic gefitinib exposure, we evaluated which receptors
were responsible for the altered downstream signaling observed in the 22Rv1, 20GS, and 20GS-EGFR cell lines. We
compared the relative phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and
HER3 in response to specific ligand stimulations in all cells
using VeraTag assays. EGF stimulation of 22Rv1, 20GS, and
20GS-EGFR cells did not alter total protein levels of EGFR,
HER2, or HER3. However, in response to HRG, EGFR and
HER2 levels were unaltered, but there was a small but reproducible decrease in HER3 protein (Fig. 4A).
EGFR was phosphorylated in all cell lines at levels that
paralleled receptor expression (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of

EGFR occurred exclusively in response to EGF. In contrast,
whereas HER2 phosphorylation tracked with receptor expression, both EGF and HRGβ1 stimulated HER2 phosphorylation. HER3 phosphorylation seemed to follow unique
regulation as HRGβ1-dependent HER3 phosphorylation paralleled HER2 expression whereas EGF-dependent HER3
phosphorylation paralleled EGFR expression. VeraTag assays
were used to assess which ligand-stimulated receptor dimers
correlated with the observed receptor phosphorylation. In
parental 22Rv1 cells, which primarily express EGFR, EGFREGFR homodimers were observed exclusively in response
to EGF stimulation (Fig. 4C) in agreement with the observation that EGFR phosphorylation was detected only in response to EGF. Although low levels of EGF-stimulated
phosphorylated HER2 and phosphorylated HER3 were observed, we did not detect ligand-stimulated EGFR-HER2 or

EGFR-HER3 heterodimers, but rather there seemed to be
baseline ligand-independent heterodimerization in the high
EGFR-expressing lines. HRG stimulation did not induce any
detectable receptor dimer partners in the 22Rv1 cells.
Similar analysis on the 20GS cells showed ∼2-fold increase
in EGFR homodimers in response to EGF stimulation. The
fold-change value was comparable with homodimer measurements in 22Rv1 cells. However, overall there were fewer
homodimers in the 20GS cells relative to the 22Rv1 cells,
corresponding to EGFR expression and phosphorylation. Unlike the direct correlation of the EGFR homodimers with
EGFR expression, the ∼3-fold increase in EGF-dependent
HER2-EGFR heterodimerization does not correlate with EGFR
expression but rather seems to correlate with both EGFR and
HER2 phosphorylation. There was very little EGF-stimulated
HER3 phosphorylation in 20GS cells, and consequently only

minor levels of EGF-stimulated phosphorylated AKT were
detected. However, HRGβ1 stimulated high levels of HER2HER3 heterodimers (Fig. 4C) correlating with the observed
HRGβ1-dependent HER2 and HER3 phosphorylation.
Lastly, the 20GS-EGFR cells expressed both EGF-stimulated and HRGβ1-stimulated HER dimers in concordance with
the observed phosphorylation patterns. These cells displayed
EGF-mediated EGFR homodimerization, increased basal li-

gand-independent EGFR dimerization, and HRGβ1-mediated
HER2-HER3 heterodimerization comparable with 20GS cells.
Overall, EGFR homodimers are the major HER dimer species
of the HER kinase signaling network in the parental 22Rv1
cells, whereas HER2 heterodimers predominate upon EGFR
downregulation in 20GS cells. 20GS-EGFR cells, which
express both EGFR and HER2, display both EGFR homodimers and HER2 heterodimers upon ligand stimulation.

Receptor dimers determine the dominant HER signaling
pathway and subsequent response to HER-targeted therapeutics. In response to chronic gefitinib treatment, EGFR expression is reduced while HER2 expression is increased. This
altered receptor profile is less responsive to EGFR-targeted
therapies. Therefore, we evaluated whether these cells would
be susceptible to HER2-targeting therapies. 22Rv1, 20GS, and
20GS-EGFR cells were treated with either EGFR-directed
therapeutics, including gefitinib or cetuximab, or a HER2targeted therapeutic, pertuzumab (2C4).
22Rv1 cells were serum-starved and stimulated with either
EGF or HRGβ1. EGF stimulated EGFR phosphorylation that,
in turn, activated AKT and MAPK. Cetuximab and gefitinib,
but not pertuzumab, inhibited EGF-stimulated EGFR and

AKT phosphorylation (cetuximab was more effective than gefitinib). EGF-stimulated MAPK was not inhibited by any of
the HER-targeted therapeutics (Fig. 5A). Alternatively,
HRGβ1 stimulated HER3 phosphorylation but caused only
a slight increase in the basal EGFR phosphorylation. The
HRGβ1-dependent activation of EGFR, HER3, AKT, and
MAPK was inhibited by the EGFR inhibitors but not by the
HER2 dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab, indicating dependence on EGFR.
In contrast, in 20GS cells in which there is a preponderance of HRGβ1-stimulated HER2 heterodimers, only pertuzumab effectively blocked dimerization as evaluated by
inhibition of HRGβ1-induced phosphorylated HER3, phosphorylated AKT, and phosphorylated MAPK measurements

(Fig. 5A). However, in these cells, although EGF-stimulated
EGFR phosphorylation was sensitive to gefitinib and cetuximab, neither HER3 nor AKT was activated in response to
EGF. Reintroduction of EGFR in 20GS-EGFR blocked pertuzumab sensitivity as assessed by HRGβ1-stimulated phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated MAPK correlates but
restored gefitinib sensitivity.
Based on the altered inhibition of receptor phosphorylation and downstream molecular correlates by HER targeting
agents, cell viability assays were performed to evaluate cell
growth sensitivity to pertuzumab. In cycling cells, the effects
of 2C4 treatment, although significant, were minimal in 20GS
and 20GS-EGFR cells (Fig. 5B). Consequently, cell viability assays were performed in the presence of HRGβ1. Although
HRGβ1 was able to induce cell growth in both 22Rv1 and
20GS lines, pertuzumab inhibited HRGβ1-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner only in the 20GS cells
(25% decrease at 20 μg/mL 2C4 and 37% decrease at
50 μg/mL 2C4), indicating an enhanced dependence on HER2
heterodimers (Fig. 5C). 20GS-EGFR cell viability was only
reduced by 35% at high concentrations of 2C4 (50 μg/mL).
Furthermore, supporting the dependence on HER2 heterodimers, 20GS tumor growth was inhibited by pertuzumab when
grown s.c. in immunodeficient mice (Fig. 5D, top) whereas
parental 22Rv1 tumor growth was not (Fig. 5D, bottom).

Discussion
Although there are a number of HER-targeted therapies in
clinical development or Food and Drug Administration approved for cancer treatment, some tumors, despite the presence of the HER target, either are not inhibited or show a
short-term response (23, 33, 34). The current definition of
drug responsiveness is based on inhibition of cellular proliferation, although HER-targeting inhibitors can cause alterations in the HER axis (24) even in the absence of this critical
phenotype. Our data show that cells, defined as “resistant” to
EGFR-targeted therapeutics, undergo similar shifts in receptor profiles as the “responsive” cells. Potentially, these altered
receptor profiles can be used to guide therapy and may be
inhibited by alternative HER-targeting therapies.
A functional receptor pathway, such as EGFR, is often not
sufficient to predict sensitivity (35) to tumor growth inhibition by EGFR-targeted therapeutics. However, despite the absence of measurable growth inhibition, which typifies
“primary therapeutic resistance,” the dynamic network of
the HER family receptors and ligands (reviewed in ref. 36)
still undergoes transient and long-term adaptation in response to targeted inhibition. This reprogramming of the
HER axis may not only activate alternate receptor/signaling
pathways that contribute to resistance but may also reveal
escape routes from targeted inhibition. Our results show that
in 22Rv1 cells, which contain functional EGFR activity, cell
proliferation was not dramatically affected by prolonged gefitinib exposure, rather the HER axis was reorganized and
EGFR was downregulated while HER2 was upregulated. This
possible gefitinib escape route through HER2 could allow for

www.aacrjournals.org

the formation of HER2-HER3 heterodimers, which could be
targeted by pertuzumab. Interestingly, a subtle but reproducible growth advantage was observed in the 20GS cells relative
to both the parental 22Rv1 or the add-back 20GS-EGFR cells
in the presence of gefitinib. The parallel growth pattern of
both the EGFR-expressing cell lines compared with the
EGFR-negative 20GS cell line supports the dominant role of
EGFR for growth. Although growth was only minimally affected in 22Rv1 cells, gefitinib effectively blocked the EGFR
pathway based on decreased EGFR phosphorylation and inhibition of downstream signals, including EGF-dependent
AKT phosphorylation. However, inhibition of both EGFR
and AKT phosphorylation by gefitinib did not accurately reflect gefitinib sensitivity based on cellular proliferation but
perhaps may have been an indicator for potential HER axis
switching.
Despite the altered HER axis profiles, the ability to activate
AKT was sustained in all cell lines consistent with its central
role in both tumorigenesis (reviewed in ref. 37) and resistance (18, 19, 38). However, the mechanism of activation
was influenced by altered HER family expression, as well as
susceptibility to alternative targeted inhibitors. HRGβ1dependent AKT activation was poorly inhibited by gefitinib
in cells with higher levels of HER2 (20GS and 20GS-EGFR),
whereas AKT was potently inhibited in cells with low HER2
expression (22Rv1). At high HER2 expression, the predominant mechanism of HRGβ1-dependent AKT activation is
likely to occur in response to HER2-HER3 heterodimerization, which is not targeted by gefitinib, whereas at low
HER2 expression, the HRGβ1-dependent AKT activation
could be a consequence of HRG-activated HER3 that comes
into contact with overexpressed EGFR, the target of gefitinib.
It seems that AKT activation and inhibition may be a downstream marker of receptor switching and consequential susceptibility to alternate HER-targeted therapeutics.
The roles of both EGFR and HER3 in EGFR-TKI susceptibility have been well studied. Coexpression of EGFR and
HER3 has been shown previously to correlate with erlotinib
sensitivity in both pancreatic and colorectal cell lines (39).
Furthermore, inhibition of EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in EGFR-TKI sensitive systems suggests that signaling
occurs between EGFR and HER3 (40). However, the mechanism by which EGF stimulates HER3 phosphorylation and
consequently AKT activation is unclear. In our study, EGFstimulated AKT activation and subsequent inhibition by
EGFR-TKI were only observed in the gefitinib-sensitive cell
lines (22Rv1 and 20GS-EGFR). EGFR and HER3 were measured in close proximity by VeraTag assays in these cells.
However, there was no evidence for ligand-dependent
EGFR-HER3 heterodimerization. It is possible that a fraction
of the detected EGFR-HER3 heterodimers is ligand-activated,
as suggested by the complementary receptor phosphorylation measurements, but that these heterodimers are transient. Alternatively, it is possible that the receptors flux
between open and closed conformations and in the absence
of ligand, particularly at higher receptor expression, both ligand-dependent as well as ligand-independent heterodimers,
are detected but are indistinguishable in the assay. In cells

with high EGFR expression basal EGFR and HER3 phosphorylation was detected, which correlated with EGFRHER3 close proximity dimers. However, in these cell lines,
there was no detectable growth advantage in the presence
of gefitinib.
In summary, our study provides insight into EGFR-TKI–
mediated HER kinase axis modulations in systems that are
supposedly “resistant” to EGFR kinase inhibition. Our data
indicate that receptor switching mechanisms are likely to occur in tumors both as a resistance mechanism for EGFR-TKI
“responsive” cells and as a priming mechanism in receptorexpressing but not growth-inhibited cells (EGFR-TKI “resistant” cells). The heterogeneous nature of tumors, coupled
with the plasticity of the HER axis, makes receptor-use
switching and altered response to targeted therapies very
probable. Multinode strategies targeting multiple HER family
members or the signaling pathways common for the HER
axis may lead to more effective treatment.
