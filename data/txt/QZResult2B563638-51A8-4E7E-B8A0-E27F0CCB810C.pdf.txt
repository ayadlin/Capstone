Abstract

Author Manuscript

The orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (HER2/Neu) transforms cells when overexpressed1,
and is an important therapeutic target in human cancer2,3. Structural studies4,5 have suggested
that the oncogenic (and ligand-independent) signalling properties of ErbB2 result from the
absence of a key intramolecular ‘tether’ in the extracellular region that autoinhibits other human
ErbB receptors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor6. Although ErbB2 is clearly
unique among the four human ErbB receptors6,7, we show here that it is the closest structural
relative of the single EGF receptor family member (dEGFR) in Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic
and biochemical data show that dEGFR is tightly regulated by growth factor ligands8, yet a crystal
structure shows that it too lacks the intramolecular tether seen in human EGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4.
Instead, a distinct set of autoinhibitory interdomain interactions hold unliganded dEGFR in an
inactive state. All of these interactions are maintained (and even extended) in ErbB2, arguing
against the suggestion that ErbB2 lacks autoinhibition. We therefore suggest that normal and
pathogenic ErbB2 signalling may be regulated by ligands in the same way as dEGFR. Our
findings have important implications for ErbB2 regulation in human cancer, and for developing
therapeutic approaches to target novel aspects of this orphan receptor.
Ligand-induced activation of EGFR involves a dramatic change in the extracellular region
from a ‘tethered’ (inactive) to an ‘extended’ (active) configuration9 (Fig. 1a) in which an
exposed ‘dimerization arm’ in domain II drives formation of receptor dimers10,11. In
tethered EGFR, the dimerization arm is occluded by autoinhibitory intramolecular
interactions between domains II and IV, which are also seen in unliganded ErbB3 and
ErbB4 – but are absent in ErbB26,12. ErbB2 is structurally unique. Even without a bound

ligand its extracellular region resembles the extended (EGF-bound) form of EGFR (Fig.
1b,c), with the dimerization arm exposed and apparently ‘poised’ to drive receptor-receptor
interactions4,5. No known soluble ligand directly regulates ErbB2, and it is the only family
member that transforms cells when simply overexpressed (without ligand addition)1. Thus,
ErbB2 is regarded as an ‘auto-activated’ receptor that adopts a constitutively activated
configuration that can form signalling-active heterodimers (or homodimers) without direct
growth factor regulation. These properties are thought to explain how ErbB2 overexpression
causes cancer7. Although ErbB2 is viewed as an oddity among human ErbB receptors, we
show here that it is the closest structural relative of the single EGF receptor family member
of D. melanogaster (dEGFR). Moreover, the structural features that initially suggested
constitutive activation of ErbB2 actually appear important for dEGFR autoinhibition. Thus,
ErbB2 shares more similarities with a possible ancestral EGF receptor than does human
EGFR itself.

We determined the 2.7Å X-ray crystal structure of the unliganded dEGFR extracellular
region, encompassing domains I to IV (Supplementary Table 1). D. melanogaster contains a
single EGFR/ErbB-receptor, which is tightly regulated by four different ligands (Spitz,
Gurken, Keren and Vein) in distinct developmental contexts8. Ligand binding is required for
dEGFR activation in cultured cells13,14 and for strong dimerization of its isolated
extracellular region in vitro13. Sequence analyses indicate that the overall domain
arrangement in dEGFR is the same as in human ErbB receptors, except for an extra
cysteine-rich domain (domain V: predicted to be similar to domains II and IV) at the
carboxyl terminus of the invertebrate EGFR extracellular region. Over domains I-IV (∼620
amino acids), dEGFR shares 39% sequence identity with human EGFR (hEGFR) and 35%
with human ErbB2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Because it is tightly regulated by ligands, we
expected that an unliganded form of the dEGFR extracellular region (s-dEGFR) would
adopt a tethered configuration similar to that seen in Fig. 1a for hEGFR. Instead, we were
surprised to find that s-dEGFR encompassing domains I to IV (s-dEGFRΔV) is fully
extended even in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1d), and closely resembles sErbB2 (Fig. 1c).
The s-dEGFRΔV dimerization arm is exposed, and the ligand-binding sites on domains I
and III are in direct contact (Fig. 1d). A structural overlay of sErbB2 and s-dEGFRΔV (Fig.
2a) shows them to be remarkably similar. Thus, the same configuration is seen for the
inactive state of one ErbB receptor extracellular region (s-dEGFRΔV without ligand) and
another that is thought to be constitutively active (sErbB2).

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies excluded the possibility that crystal packing
causes s-dEGFRΔV to be extended. SAXS measurements of the maximum molecular
dimension (Dmax), together with low-resolution molecular envelopes, allow clear distinction
between extended and tethered configurations of ErbB receptor extracellular regions in
solution15. Dmax for s-dEGFRΔV in solution is 130Å (Supplementary Table 2), equal to the
value measured for sErbB215 and 25-30Å larger than values for the tethered human EGFR
extracellular region (∼105Å)15. Low-resolution molecular envelopes (Fig. 2b) also show
that s-dEGFRΔV is extended in solution. SAXS studies of complete s-dEGFR (with domain
V) gave an average Dmax of 165Å (Supplementary Table 2), indicating that domain V
simply projects from the end of domain IV to extend the structure (Fig. 2b and

Supplementary Fig. 2). Mutational studies provide further evidence for the absence of an
autoinhibitory tether in dEGFR. The affinity of human EGFR for its ligands is increased
when the domain II/IV tether is weakened with mutations or abolished by removing domain
IV16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). These mutations favour EGF binding by reducing the
work required to relocate domains I and III for interaction with the same EGF molecule (and
do not cause constitutive hEGFR activation16,18,19). Equivalent substitutions or deletions
in s-dEGFR do not enhance Spitz binding (Supplementary Fig. 3b), arguing that dEGFR has
no domain II/IV tether. Thus, our crystallographic and solution studies show that the
unactivated Drosophila EGFR extracellular region adopts the same extended configuration
as seen for ErbB2.

Author Manuscript

Key elements of unliganded s-dEGFR overlay very well with the unactivated human EGFR
extracellular region (s-hEGFR). As shown in Fig. 3a, the conformation of domain II in
inactive s-dEGFRΔV (red) closely resembles that of domain II in inactive (tethered) shEGFR (grey) in an overlay using domain I as reference. This appears to be a characteristic
‘inactive’ domain II conformation, which is also shared by the unliganded ErbB3 and ErbB4
extracellular regions12,20. By contrast, activated s-hEGFR11 has a strikingly different
domain II structure, with a ∼12° bend between modules m4 and m5 (at the green arrow in
Fig. 3b) that is known to be crucial for ligand-induced dimerization16. Importantly, the
domain II conformation in sErbB2 superimposes precisely with the inactive s-dEGFR and shEGFR structures (cyan structure in Fig. 3a), but not with the activated human EGFR
structure. ErbB2 therefore has an ‘inactive-like’ domain II, suggesting that published
sErbB2 structures4,5 may actually represent an inactive (autoinhibited) configuration.

The failure of sErbB2 and unliganded s-dEGFRΔV to self-associate strongly, despite both
having an exposed dimerization arm, also argues for an ‘inactive’, or dimerizationincompetent domain II conformation. The ErbB2 extracellular region does not
homodimerize in solution21,22 or in crystals4,5, and its heterodimerization with other
sErbB proteins is barely detectable21,22. Unliganded s-dEGFRΔV forms a crystallographic
dimer mediated almost entirely by dimerization arm contacts (Supplementary Fig. 4). This
self-association occurs only weakly in solution, with an approximate KD of 40μM based on
analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (Supplementary Fig. 4). Strong dimerization of sdEGFRΔV or s-dEGFR requires Spitz binding (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Thus, the
extracellular region of ErbB2 – the human ErbB receptor believed to be unique in its ability
to form ligand-independent homo- and hetero-dimers7,23 – actually has less propensity for
self-association than the equivalent region of the unliganded Drosophila EGF receptor.
ErbB2 also shows no greater tendency to homodimerize in cells than unliganded hEGFR24,
and is not constitutively active when expressed at physiologically relevant levels in insect
cells25. Together, these data point to ErbB2 being an inactive receptor – and one that may
be more stringently autoinhibited than dEGFR.
Fig. 3 suggests a mechanism for dEGFR regulation by growth factor binding that may also
be relevant for ErbB2. Wedging an EGF-like molecule between the two ligand-binding
domains I and III will push them apart as diagrammed in Fig. 3c, necessitating a significant
bend in domain II (which links domains I and III). Movement of disulphide-bonded module
m5 with respect to m4 (at the green arrow in Fig. 3b) accounts for most of this bend, and

effectively links ligand binding to reorientation of the dimerization arm. The result is a bent
domain II conformation that can present a self-complementary dimerization interface (for
homodimerization) or one that is optimized for heterodimerization. Direct interactions
between domains I and III of s-dEGFR work against this process – and are therefore
autoinhibitory. Interactions between domains I and III of s-dEGFRΔV involve regions that
correspond exactly to the ligand-binding sites of hEGFR10,11, and therefore directly
occlude the ligand binding sites (Fig. 1a) and bury 452 Å2 of surface. Details of these
interactions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. The same elements in sErbB2 also
contribute to direct domain I/III interactions4,5, but are augmented by additional contacts to
bring domains I and III even closer together (by ∼8Å) than in s-dEGFR (Fig. 2a), burying a
total surface of ∼1250Å2 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The direct domain I/III interactions seen
in dEGFR (and ErbB2) are autoinhibitory because they force the two parts of the ligandbinding site so close to one another that ligand cannot be accommodated. By contrast, the
domain II/IV tether in hEGFR (Fig. 1a) pulls the two halves of the ligand-binding site (on
domains I and III) too far apart for them both to contact the same ligand molecule
simultaneously. The autoinhibitory consequence for ligand binding is similar in both cases,
with work being required to separate domains I and III in dEGFR, but (conversely) to draw
them together in hEGFR by breaking the domain II/IV tether. Thus, these are variations on
the same autoinhibitory theme.

The close apposition of domains I and III in dEGFR also promotes an important set of
domain I/II interactions (Fig. 3c) that stabilize the inactive domain II conformation. Sidechains from the ‘back’ of s-dEGFR domain II in modules m5 and m6 (Y259 and H270
respectively) pack against a hydrophobic patch on domain I comprising the side-chains of
I2, I4 and Y32 (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6a), and form hydrogen bonds with D34 in
domain I. These interactions restrain the orientation of modules m5 and m6 with respect to
m4, and maintain the dimerization arm in the ‘inactive’ position shown in Fig. 3a,c. Very
similar sets of domain I/II interactions occur in sErbB2 (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and
inactive hEGFR (Supplementary Fig. 6c), as well as unliganded ErbB3 and ErbB412,20. All
of these interactions are broken in the active configuration (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig.
6d), so that domain II modules m5 and m6 no longer make direct contact with domain I, and
the dimerization arm becomes reoriented. Disrupting these domain I/II interactions in sdEGFR, by mutating Y259 and H270 to alanine and serine respectively, enhances Spitzbinding to approximately the same extent as domain II/IV tether mutations enhance EGF
binding to s-hEGFR17 (Supplementary Fig. 7; Supplementary Table 3). From the
perspective of ligand binding, domain I/II contacts in dEGFR therefore constitute an
(autoinhibitory) energetic barrier that is similar in strength to the domain II/IV tether in
human EGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Disrupting domain I/II contacts in intact dEGFR or ErbB2
did not elevate constitutive activity of these receptors (data not shown). Importantly,
however, neither does disruption of domain II/IV tether contacts in hEGFR16,18,19.
Breaking autoinhibitory interactions in the extracellular region, while necessary for
activation, is clearly not sufficient. Indeed, even if domain IV is deleted entirely from shEGFR (so that the tether cannot form), dimerization still requires EGF addition10. Thus,
the unliganded Drosophila and human EGF receptors rely on different sets of autoinhibitory
intramolecular interactions to oppose ligand binding and dimerization.

The fact that ErbB2 maintains – and even extends – all of the autoinhibitory interactions
seen in Drosophila EGFR argues against the prevailing notion that ErbB2 is ‘poised’ to
dimerize through its exposed dimerization arm4,5. Furthermore, the failure of sErbB2 to
form homo- or heterodimers in vitro21,22 suggests that it is even more stringently
autoinhibited than s-dEGFR (which does homodimerize weakly) – consistent with its larger
domain I/III interface (Supplementary Fig. 5). Nonetheless, crosslinking and coimmunoprecipitation studies show that intact ErbB2 can form homo- and heterodimers in
mammalian cells7,23,26. One possible explanation is that ErbB2 relies uniquely on
interactions outside its extracellular region to drive dimerization. A second very intriguing
possibility is that unknown cellular ligands promote ErbB2 activation when it is
overexpressed in mammalian cells (but not in insect cells25). The first of these possibilities
is countered by reports that deleting the cytoplasmic region does not abolish ErbB2 homoor heterodimerization26 – although a key role for the transmembrane domain cannot be
excluded. The second possibility seems unlikely given the failure of substantial efforts in the
1980s and 1990s to identify direct soluble ErbB2-activating ligands7.

Author Manuscript

Although no bona fide soluble ligand for ErbB2 is known, at least one membrane-bound
regulator that contains EGF-like domains has been identified27. A subunit of Muc4
(ASGP2) was reported to interact with ErbB2 and to promote its tyrosine phosphorylation.
An EGF-like domain in membrane-associated Muc4 might bind between domains I and III
of ErbB2 and induce conformational changes of the sort depicted in Fig. 3c,d to promote the
ability of ErbB2 to form homo- and/or heterodimers. Intriguingly, it has been shown
genetically that Spitz must be palmitoylated (which drives its membrane association28) in
order to regulate dEGFR in vivo28. Gurken and Keren have a similar palmitoylation site,
whereas Vein – considered to be a ‘weak’ dEGFR ligand8 – does not. Thus, membrane
association appears to be a key feature of ligands (Muc4 and Spitz) that activate the two
ErbB receptors known to adopt an extended configuration in the absence of ligand (ErbB2
and dEGFR). Membrane association may be required to increase the local ligand
concentration at the cell surface, so as to promote the ligand's ability to ‘wedge apart’
domains I and III of dEGFR or ErbB2 (breaking autoinhibitory domain I/III interactions).
By contrast, the tethered configuration of hEGFR, ErbB3 and ErbB4 (Fig. 1a) keeps the
ligand-binding sites on domains I and III fully exposed and freely accessible to soluble
growth factors. We speculate that evolution of the domain II/IV tether as a distinct mode of
autoinhibition might have occurred alongside the ability of ErbB receptors (other than
ErbB2) to respond to soluble (rather than membrane-bound) growth factor ligands.

Author Manuscript

Given the importance of ErbB2 in human cancer, and its validated utility as a target of
cancer therapeutics3, the view of ErbB2 regulation presented here has several implications.
Developing agents that stabilize autoinhibitory interactions might represent a new
therapeutic avenue for inhibiting ErbB2 signalling in cancer. Just as importantly, the fact
that ErbB2 shows such striking resemblance to a tightly ligand-regulated invertebrate EGF
receptor argues that ErbB2 also has activating ligands. Identifying these likely membraneassociated ligands, and appreciating their role in activating ErbB2 in different human
cancers, should provide important new directions for therapeutic targeting of ErbB receptor
signalling.

Methods Summary
Histidine-tagged s-dEGFR and s-dEGFRΔV were produced by secretion from baculovirusinfected Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells or transfected Drosophila S2 cells. The C-terminal
amino acid of s-dEGFRΔV was T589 in the numbering convention used in Supplementary
Fig. 1 (see Online Methods). Secreted protein was harvested by metal affinity
chromatography, and further purified by ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography
as described13. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and
sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation studies were performed essentially
as described13,15,16.

Purified s-dEGFRΔV was crystallized using the vapour diffusion method in 10% PEG 4000,
5% Jeffamine M-600 (pH 7.0), 12.5% ethylene glycol, 100mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50mM
KCl. Plate-shaped crystals of approximate dimensions 200μm × 200μm × 75μm grew in 1-5
days, and were frozen directly from the mother liquor. Data were collected using beamline
23ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL), as described in Supplementary Table
1. The structure of s-dEGFRΔV was solved using molecular replacement (MR) methods.
Search models based on the coordinates of domains I and III from ErbB2 (PDB code 2a91)5
were generated by substituting non-conserved amino acids with alanines. Although MR
solutions could not be found for domains II or IV, initial maps based on domain I/III models
showed strong density for domain II. Model building with COOT29, was alternated with
successive rounds of restrained refinement using REFMAC30. In later stages of refinement,
composite omit maps were generated, which allowed much of domain IV to be built, and
oligosaccharides to be placed.

Coding regions for wild-type and mutated forms of s-dEGFR were subcloned into
pFastbac-1 and pMT/V5-His A (Invitrogen) for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)
and Drosophila melanogaster Schneider-2 (S2) cells respectively. A C-terminal hexahistidine tag was incorporated in all constructs using PCR. s-dEGFRΔV ended at T589 using
the numbering scheme employed in Supplementary Fig. 1 (see comments in Crystallography
section below on dEGFR numbering), and s-dEGFRΔIV-V was truncated at N493. Two sets
of mutations were made to disrupt the domain I/II autoinhibitory interface for
Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3. In one, Y259 and H270 in domain II
were mutated to alanine and serine respectively. In the second, sites in domains I and II were
mutated, to give the tetramutant I2A/Y32A/Y259A/H270S. The effects of these mutations
were assessed both in the background of wild-type s-dEGFR and a Y242S/Y247S mutant in
which dimer contacts are disrupted. The s-dEGFRΔVdim-arm construct referred to in
Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2 contains a series of mutations in the
domain II dimerization arm analogous to those previously shown to abolish ligand-induced
dimerization of human sEGFR10: Y242E, N243A, T245D, Y247E, V248A, and L249D.
The s-dEGFRtether mutant referred to in Supplementary Fig. 3 contains three mutations in
domain IV analogous to those that break all intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions
between domains II and IV observed in the unliganded s-hEGFR structure17: D547A,

Stable S2 cell pools and recombinant baculoviruses were generated as described13,17,31,
and each protein of interest was secreted into the culture medium. For S2 cell-expressed
proteins, S2 cells were grown in EX-CELL 420 serum-free medium (Sigma-Aldrich) to a
density of ∼5-10×106 cells/ml, and protein expression was induced with 500 μM CuSO4 for
3-4 days. For Sf9 cell-expressed proteins, Sf9 cells were grown in Sf900II medium
(Invitrogen-Gibco) to a density of 2-3×106 cells/ml, and were infected with recombinant
baculovirus for 3-4 days. In each case, 2-4 litres of conditioned media were flowed over a
3-4 ml bed volume of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). After washing the column with 25mM
MES pH 6.0, 150mM NaCl (buffer A), bound proteins were eluted with increasing
concentrations of imidazole in buffer A. Protein-containing fractions were applied to a UnoS (Biorad) cation-exchange column, equilibrated in buffer A, and were eluted with a salt
gradient from 150mM to 1M NaCl in buffer A. s-dEGFR proteins eluted between
200-500mM NaCl, and were concentrated using a Centricon-50 concentrator (Millipore)
prior to further purification with size exclusion chromatography using a Superose-6 column
(GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B (25mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl). Secreted
Spitz and SpitzC29S were purified from S2 cells exactly as described previously13,28,31.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)

Secreted Spitz was immobilized onto CM5 sensorchips using amine coupling, exactly as
described previously13. Increasing concentrations of s-dEGFR proteins (12.5nM - 6,400nM)
were then flowed over the sensorchip in buffer B containing 0.005% Surfactant P20 at 25°C.
The sensorchip surface was regenerated after each injection using 10mM sodium acetate, pH
4.5, 1M NaCl, as described13. The maximum SPR response at steady state for each sdEGFR concentration was plotted against s-dEGFR concentration, and the resulting curves
could be fit straightforwardly to simple binding isotherms using the program Prism
(GraphPad), from which apparent KD values were obtained. Standard error of the mean
(S.E.M) values were generated from at least 3 independent measurements, using at least two
independent preparations of each protein.
Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)

Author Manuscript

SAXS data were collected at room temperature both with a rotating anode source at Fox
Chase Cancer Center (courtesy of Dr. Zimei Bu), as described15, or at CHESS beamline G1,
using protein samples at concentrations between 1-6 mg/ml in buffer B. Data handling and
reduction were performed as described previously15 or using the program Datasqueeze
(Datasqueeze Software). Potential problems with radiation-induced denaturation were
monitored by inspection of Kratky plots with increasing exposure time, graphing IQ2 as a
function of Q, where I is the scattered intensity and Q=4πsin(θ/2)/λ (where Q is the
magnitude of the scattering vector, with θ as the scattering angle and λ as the X-ray
wavelength). The program GNOM32 was used to obtain P(r) curves, the maximum
dimension of the molecule (Dmax), and its radius of gyration (Rg). Quoted Rg values
(Supplementary Table 2) represent means (± standard deviation) from at least three
independent determinations. Dmax values were determined empirically by recomputing P(r)

Dmax the rmax value at which P(r) most closely approached zero while giving a plausible
P(r) curve. Errors in Dmax values are quoted as ±5Å based on the empirical approach used
for their determination. Low-resolution molecular envelopes were generated ab initio using
the program DAMMIN as previously described16,17,33, using SAXS data collected on the
home source with s-dEGFR concentrations between 1-2 mg/ml. Briefly, ten iterations of
DAMMIN were averaged and filtered as described34, using the DAMAVER suite of
programs. Crystal structures of models were docked into the resulting ‘most probable’
envelopes using SITUS35, and the outputs were displayed and manually refined using the
UCSF Chimera package (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera)36.

Experiments were performed exactly as described21, with the following modifications.
Receptor extracellular regions at 2, 4, and 8μM, both with- and without a 1.2-fold excess of
Spitz were centrifuged in buffer B at 6,000, 9,000, and 12,000 rpm in an Optima XL-A
analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 25°C, using absorbance at 280nm to detect protein
distribution. The program Winmatch (http://www.biotech.uconn.edu/auf/) was utilized to
ensure that samples had reached equilibrium. Data were analyzed using Sedfit and Sedphat
(http://www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com), and were fit to a monomer-dimer
equilibrium model as described16, considering s-dEGFR or the s-dEGFR/Spitz complex as
the dimerizing species. Fits used to determine the quoted KD values gave good residuals,
with no systematic deviations. In Supplementary Fig. 4a, sedimentation data are plotted as
lnA280 vs. (r2-r02/2), where r is the radial position in the sample and ro is the radial position
of the meniscus. For a single species, this representation gives a straight line with slope
proportional to its molecular mass. Standard deviations quoted represent data from at least
three independent experiments.

Generation of s-dEGFRΔV protein suitable for crystallization

Author Manuscript

The torpedo locus in Drosophila melanogaster encodes two splice variants named dEGFR1
and dEGFR2 that differ only at their N-termini37,38. Mature dEGFR1 and dEGFR2 have Nterminal extensions of 21 and 71 amino acids respectively, which show no significant
sequence similarity, are devoid of significant predicted secondary structure, and are
proteolytically labile as determined by N-terminal sequencing of the corresponding sdEGFR species. We found that s-dEGFR1 and s-dEGFR2 bind Spitz with the same affinity
(data not shown), and removal of the N-terminal extensions has no influence on Spitz
binding (data not shown). Beyond amino acid 22 of mature dEGFR1 (C53 of predicted prodEGFR1) and amino acid 72 of mature dEGFR2 (C102 of pro-dEGFR2), the two spliceforms are identical. Therefore, to generate a protein amenable for crystallization (s-dEGFR),
we deleted amino acids 1-21 and 1-71 of mature dEGFR1 and dEGFR2 respectively
(equivalent to amino acids 1-52 and 1-101 of the respective pro-forms), so that the Nterminal amino acid of mature s-dEGFR corresponds to K20 of mature dEGFR1 or K70 of
mature dEGFR2 (the second residue: V21 in mature dEGFR1 and I71 in mature dEGFR2, is
I2 in mature s-dEGFR: Supplementary Fig. 1). Immediately before K1 of s-dEGFR, we

added a BiP signal sequence (substituted for the native one) to drive secretion of s-dEGFR
into the culture medium, followed by a hexahistidine tag (in addition to the His6 tag at the
C-terminus), so that the presumed mature s-dEGFR protein secreted from S2 or Sf9 cells
starts with six histidines, which we number -5 to 0. Domain V was also deleted from sdEGFR at Thr 589 (using the numbering in Supplementary Fig. 1), yielding s-dEGFRΔV,
which also has a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Whereas crystals grown with s-dEGFR2
protein diffracted poorly, s-dEGFRΔV crystals diffracted well to 2.7Å resolution.

Purified s-dEGFRΔV (see above) at 100μM was crystallized using the vapour diffusion
method by mixing equal volumes of protein with a solution containing 10% PEG 4000, 5%
Jeffamine M-600 (pH 7.0), 12.5% ethylene glycol, 100mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50mM
KCl, and equilibrating the mixture over a reservoir of this solution at 21°C. Plate-shaped
crystals of approximate dimensions 200μm × 200μm × 75μm grew in 1-5 days, and were
frozen directly from the mother liquor. Data were collected using beamline 23ID-D at the
Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL), and were processed using HKL-200039. Crystals
were of space group C2221, with unit cell dimensions a=74.4Å, b=174.8Å, c=161.6Å and
α=β=γ=90°. There is one s-dEGFRΔV molecule in the asymmetric unit, with a Matthews
coefficient of 3.2Å3/Da, giving a solvent content of 62.2%.
Molecular replacement and refinement

Author Manuscript

The structure of s-dEGFRΔV was solved using molecular replacement (MR) methods.
Search models based on the coordinates of domains I and III from ErbB2 (PDB code
2a91)10 were generated by substituting non-conserved amino acids with alanines. Domains
I and III were found in simultaneous but independent searches using PHASER (CCP4)30.
Although we were unable to find MR solutions for domains II or IV with a variety of search
models, initial maps based on domain I/III models showed strong density for domain II.
Model building with COOT29, was alternated with successive rounds of restrained
refinement using REFMAC30, and solvent flattening with DM30. In later stages of
refinement, composite omit maps were generated in CNS40, which allowed much of domain
IV to be built, and oligosaccharides to be placed. The final stages of refinement employed
TLS refinement41 with anisotropic motion tensors refined for each of the four domains,
using REFMAC30.
Calculations and figure preparation

Author Manuscript

Calculations of buried surface were performed using AREAIMOL in the CCP4 suite of
programs30. Calculations of surface complementarity,SC42 used the program SC in
CCP430. Structure validation was performed with SFCHECK and PROCHECK in CCP430.
Figures were generated using MacPymol43 (http://www.pymol.org).

ErbB receptor autoinhibition.
a, The unliganded hEGFR extracellular region adopts a tethered structure (left), burying its
dimerization arm (green) in autoinhibitory domain II/IV interactions. Domains I, II, III and
IV are blue, green, yellow and red respectively. Binding of EGF (magenta) to domains I and
III stabilizes extended s-hEGFR, exposing the dimerization arm (centre) to promote receptor
dimerization (right)9. Most of domain IV was missing from extended s-hEGFR10,11
structures, and was added to the centre and right-hand panels using the domain IV structure
of tethered s-hEGFR (left)17. b, Surface representation of a monomer from the EGF-bound
s-hEGFR dimer (PDB ID 1ivo)11. c, sErbB2 (PDB ID 1n8z: shown in surface
representation) adopts an extended configuration similar to an activated s-hEGFR
monomer4. d, Even in its inactive, unliganded state, s-dEGFRΔV is completely extended
and closely resembles both sErbB2 and activated s-hEGFR.

The unactivated dEGFR extracellular region closely resembles sErbB2.
a, Global superimposition of inactive s-dEGFRΔV (red) and sErbB2 (cyan)4 illustrates their
conformational similarity. Direct domain I-III interactions (more extensive in sErbB2 than
in s-dEGFR) help stabilize the extended configuration in both receptors (Supplementary Fig.
5) and block ligand-binding sites.

marked (see Supplementary Table 2). The s-dEGFRΔV envelope readily accommodates the
crystallographic model. In intact s-dEGFR, domain V (orange) appears simply to add to the
maximum dimension. Domain V and the domain IV C-terminus (poorly defined in our
crystal structure) were modelled using s-hEGFR domain IV as template. In the right-hand
panel, the three most C-terminal terminal disulphide-linked modules of domain V have been
removed. The fact that these are not accommodated by the SAXS envelope suggests
flexibility at the C-terminus.

Ligand binding breaks autoinhibitory domain I/II interactions common to s-dEGFR, shEGFR and sErbB2.
a, Superposition of inactive s-hEGFR (grey) on s-dEGFRΔV (red) and sErbB2 (cyan) using
domain I as reference. The eight disulphide-bonded modules (m1-m8) that define domain II
are labelled, as is the dimerization arm – located almost identically in all three structures.
Domain III of inactive s-hEGFR is removed for clarity. b, A similar overlay of active shEGFR (green) and inactive s-dEGFRΔV (red) highlights dimerization arm reorientation
upon ligand binding. The structures overlay very well in modules m1-m4 of domain II, but
deviate significantly at the m4/m5 linkage (green arrow) because of a ligand-induced bend.
c-d, Model for activation of dEGFR (and ErbB2) by wedging an EGF-like ligand (blue)

interactions, as well as a set of domain I/II contacts that normally maintain domain II in an
inactive conformation (residues shown in space-filling representation: see Supplementary
