Abstract
As a tumor marker for colorectal cancers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) enhances the metastatic potential of cancer cells. CEA functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule and is upregulated in a wide variety of
human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CEA mediates metastasis remain to be understood. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling regulates both tumor suppression and metastasis, and
also contributes to the stimulation of CEA transcription and secretion in colorectal cancer cells. However, it
remains unknown whether CEA, in turn, influences TGF-β functions and if a regulatory cross-talk exists between CEA and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Here, we report that CEA directly interacts with TGF-β receptor
and inhibits TGF-β signaling. Targeting CEA with either CEA-specific antibody or siRNA rescues TGF-β response in colorectal cancer cell lines with elevated CEA, thereby restoring the inhibitory effects of TGF-β
signaling on proliferation. CEA also enhances the survival of colorectal cancer cells in both local colonization
and liver metastasis in animal study. Our study provides novel insights into the interaction between CEA and
TGF-β signaling pathway and establishes a negative feedback loop in amplifying the progression of colon
cancer cells to more invasive phenotypes. These findings offer new therapeutic opportunities to inhibit colorectal cancer cell proliferation by cotargeting CEA in promoting tumor-inhibitory action of the TGF-β
pathway. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8159–68. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In humans, the CEA family
consists of 29 genes. CEA and CEACAM6 belong to the
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)–anchored CEA family,
and are normally predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract but overexpressed in as many as 70% of all
human cancers (1, 2). It has been shown that all CEA family
members function as homotypic intercellular adhesion molecules (3–5). Currently, CEA is used as a tumor marker for
the clinical management of colorectal cancer. Elevated
blood levels of CEA indicate metastasis and poor prognosis
(6, 7). There is increasing evidence that CEA is involved in
multiple biological aspects of neoplasia such as cell adhesion, metastasis, suppression of cellular immune mechanisms, and inhibition of apoptosis (8–13). For instance,

CEA increases the ability of weakly metastatic colorectal
cancer to colonize in the liver and develop spontaneous
hematogenous liver and lung metastasis (14–16). CEA expression also correlates well with resistance to cytotoxic
chemotherapy (12) and to anoikis (10, 17). The inhibitory
role of CEA in cell differentiation (9, 13, 18) and anoikis
(17, 19) has been extensively documented. However, the
molecular mechanism by which CEA enhances tumor metastasis continues to be poorly understood.
The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling
pathway is involved in the control of multiple biological
processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (20, 21). It is one of the most commonly altered cellular signaling pathways in human
cancers (22). Three TGF-β isoforms (TGFB1, TGFB2, and
TGFB3) are expressed in mammalian epithelium, each encoded by a unique gene and expressed in both a tissuespecific and developmentally regulated manner. Among
these, TGFB1 is the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed isoform. TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of TGF-β ligand to the type II TGF-β receptors
(TBRII). The ligand binds tightly to the ectodomain of
the type II receptor first; this binding allows the subsequent incorporation of the TGF-β type I receptor (TBRI),
forming a large ligand-receptor complex involving a ligand
dimer and four receptor molecules. Binding to the extracellular domains of both types of the receptors by the dimeric ligand induces a close proximity and a productive

conformation for the intracellular kinase domains of the
receptors, facilitating the phosphorylation and subsequent
activation of the type I receptor (23).
With the help of adaptor proteins such as SARA and β2SP
(β2 spectrin), activated TBRI then recruits and phosphorylates two downstream transcription factors, Smad2 and
Smad3, allowing them to bind to Smad4 (20, 21, 24, 25).
The resulting Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus
and interact with other transcription factors in a cell-specific
manner to regulate the transcription of a multitude of TGFβ–responsive genes (26). Some of the downstream targets of
TGF-β signaling are important cell cycle checkpoint genes,
including p21, p27, and p15, and their activation leads to
growth arrest (20). In normal and premalignant cells,
TGF-β enforces homeostasis and suppresses tumor progression
through cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive effects (cytostasis, differentiation, and apoptosis) or through effects on the
stroma (suppression of inflammation and stroma-derived
mitogens). However, when cancer cells lose TGF-β tumorsuppressive responses, they can use TGF-β to their advantage to initiate differentiation into an invasive phenotype
and metastatic dissemination (24). Current data strongly support the notion that TGF-β signaling suppresses colorectal
cancers. Many colorectal cancers escape the tumor-suppressor
effects of TGF-β signaling and are resistant to TGF-β–induced
growth inhibition (27).
Aberrant upregulation of CEA and alteration of TGF-β signaling are common features of colorectal cancers. Because
both CEA and TGF-β signaling are involved in the development and progression of colorectal tumors, the possible
interaction between them has been investigated by several
groups. It is known that TGF-β induces CEA secretion in a
dose-dependent manner (28). Also, CEA and CEACAM6 are
identified as target genes for Smad3-mediated TGF-β signaling (29). However, little is known about the effects of CEA on
the TGF-β signaling pathway. Our data show the interaction
of CEA with TBRI, indicating the possible influence of CEA
on TGF-β signaling.
In the current study, we focus on the effects of CEA on
TGF-β signaling in both normal cells and in colorectal cancer
cells. Our studies show that CEA directly binds to TBRI. Furthermore, overexpression of CEA inhibits TGF-β signaling. In
colorectal cancer cells with elevated CEA, targeting CEA with
specific antibody or siRNA rescues their response to TGF-β
stimulation, thereby restoring the inhibitory effects of
TGF-β on the proliferation of these cancer cells.

Tissue culture, transfections, and lentivirus infection
Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (microsatellite
instable cell lines: Lovo, HCT116, DLD-1,HCT-15, LS174T,
LS180, and HCT-6; microsatellite stable cell lines: HT-29,
Caco-2, SW480, SK-CO-1, and Colo205) and 293T cells
were obtained and characterized by the American Type
Culture Collection with PCR within 6 months. Clone A,
a human metastatic colorectal cancer cell (17), was provided and characterized by Dr. Jessup's laboratory 2 years
ago, and tested again by Radil Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory with PCR 1 year ago. All colorectal cancer
cell lines were maintained in DMEM or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidifier
chamber. 293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10%
FBS and antibiotics at 37°C and at 5% CO2. Transfections
were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Generation of stable clone A transfectants was described
previously (17). GIPZ lentiviral shRNA particles targeting
human CEA (ThermoFisher RHS4348) and control lentiviral shRNA particles were from Openbiosystems. Cells were
infected with lentiviral shRNA particles according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Antibodies and immunotechniques
Antibodies against CEA (Thermo MS-613-P0, MS-613P1), Smad3 (Invitrogen 51-1500), phosphorylated Smad3
(Santa Cruz Sc-130218), TGFβRI (Santa Cruz Sc-398),
TGFβRII (Upstate 06-318), V5 (Invitrogen R960-25), and
HA (Sigma-Aldrich H3663) were purchased. Secondary
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon) were purchased. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures were described elsewhere (30). To
avoid signal noise from IgG chains, Trueblot IP beads
(00-8800, 00-8811) and Trueblot Western Blot Kit (888887, 88-8886) were used according to the manufacturer's
instruction.
Reverse transcriptase-PCR for TGF-β–regulated gene
expression
The primers used for amplifications were as follows:
c-myc F: 5′-TCAAGAGGCGAACACACAAC-3′, R: 5′-GGCCTTTTCATTGTTTTCCA-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) F: 5′-CATTGACCTTCACTACATGGT-3′, R: 5′-ACCCTTCAAGTGAGCCCCAG-3′. Reverse
transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as previously
described (25).
Confocal and fluorescence microscopy
Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized
in 0.1% Triton X-100. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by incubating
with secondary antibodies conjugated with TR (Santa
Cruz) and FITC (Santa Cruz) for 2 hours at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was carried out using an
Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope in the Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center.

according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Results
In vitro binding assay
Recombinant HA-TBRI and HA-TBRII proteins expressed
in 293T cells were purified with Flag HA Tandem Affinity
Purification Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified HA-TBRI (2 μg) or HA-TBRII (2 μg)
proteins were incubated with purified CEA (2 μg) protein in
binding buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF, 10 nmol/L okadaic acid, 0.1% Nonidet
P40] for 60 minutes at 4°C. The reactions were then incubated with monoclonal anti–HA-Agrose beads (Sigma A2095) for
an additional 1 hour. The beads were extensively washed
with binding buffer, and associated proteins were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE.
Reporter assay
C-myc-luciferase assay was performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and the results
were standardized against β-galactosidase activity.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described previously (32). Briefly, cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde and sonicated on ice to fragment
chromatin into an average length of 500 to 1 kb. Antibodies
were used to immunoprecipitate the respective antigens at 4°
C overnight. Protein A Sepharose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin and single-strand DNA were added to
the lysate to isolate the antibody-bound complexes. The
beads were washed to remove nonspecific binding, and the
antibody-bound chromatin was eluted. The eluate was “decrosslinked” by heating at 65°C for 6 hours, and then treated
with RNase and proteinase K. DNA was extracted using the
phenol chloroform method. PCR was performed by using the
following primers for human c-myc promoter: region −5 to
−233, F: TTTATAATGCGAGGGTCTGGACGGC, R: ACAGCGAGTTAGATAAAGCCCCGAAAA; region −607 to −751 F: ATCATTCTAGGCATCGTTTTCCTC, R: GGGAAAGGGCCGCGCTTTGATCAA.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Nuclear extracts were prepared using a Nonidet P40 lysis
method. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for
Smad3 DNA binding was performed using the annealed
and [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled PCR product of human c-myc
promoter region (−5 to −233) for 15 minutes at 20°C. Samples
were run on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel and imaged by autoradiography. Specific competitions were performed by adding a 100 mol/L excess of the competitor to
the incubation mixture, and supershift EMSAs were performed by adding 200 ng of the Smad3 antibody.
Cell proliferation assay
Trypan blue–negative live cells (10,000 per well) were seeded into 96-well plates. Cell proliferation was assessed by us-

CEA interacts with TGF-β receptor I
It has been reported that TGF-β regulates CEA expression
and secretion (28, 29). However, little is known about the influence of CEA on TGF-β signaling. We first examined
whether there was a direct interaction between CEA and
the components of the TGF-β signaling pathway by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Wt CEA was cotransfected with one
of the five elements of the TGF-β signaling pathway as indicated in Fig. 1A. Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to examine the interaction between
CEA and these five elements. We found that, indeed, CEA
could be effectively coimmunoprecipitated with TBRI but
not with other elements. We also noticed the endogenous interaction between CEA and TBRI but not TBRII in two colorectal cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). To evaluate whether the
noticed interaction between CEA and TBRI was direct, we
performed an in vitro binding assay. Recombinant HA-TBRI
and HA-TBRII proteins purified from 293T cells were incubated with CEA protein. Association between CEA with TBRI
but not TBRII was observed (Fig. 1C). These findings showed
that the interaction between CEA and TBRI was direct and
did not require the presence of other proteins. We next assessed where these two proteins interacted with each other
in situ by immunofluorescence staining. Cells were transfected with or without CEA. Twenty-four hours later, cells
were fixed and stained for CEA and TBRI. The results
showed the colocalization of CEA and TBRI in the cell membrane (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that CEA may regulate
TGF-β signaling by binding to TBRI at the membrane.
Together, for the first time, these findings establish the physical interaction of CEA and TBRI in physiologically relevant
settings.
CEA inhibits TGF-β signaling
Next, we investigated whether the noticed association of
CEA and TBRI modulates TGF-β signaling. TGF-β signals
through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of both
TBRI and TBRII. Activated TBRI recruits and phosphorylates
R-Smads, and enables the resulting complex to bind to
Smad4. Following binding to Smad4, the complex translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription of various
target genes. First, we examined the impact of CEA overexpression on the recruitment of Smad3 to TBRI. 293T cells
were cotransfected with TBRI, Smad3, and CEA, treated with
TGF-β for 1 hour, and total cell lysates were subjected to
coimmunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, association of TBRI with Smad3 was attenuated in the presence of
CEA compared with in the absence of CEA. We then sought
to determine if Smad3 phosphorylation was modified by
CEA. 293T cells were transfected with or without CEA for
24 hours, and then stimulated with TGF-β for different time
periods. Cells were harvested and the levels of p-Smad3
and Smad3 proteins were evaluated by Western blotting.

(Fig. 2C). To independently verify these results from
confocal microscopy, total cell lysates were fractionated into the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. As expected from
the preceding results, we found a substantial decrease in
the levels of nuclear Smad3 in the cells with overexpressed

CEA after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 2D). To establish a modulating effect of CEA on the functionality of Smad3, we next
examined the level of c-myc mRNA, one of the targets of
the TGF-β signaling pathway. Although TGF-β induced
downregulation of c-myc transcription in control cells, over-

expression of CEA blocked the inhibitory effects of TGF-β
on c-myc transcription (Fig. 2E). The observed inhibitory
effects of CEA on TGF-β target genes was not restricted
to c-myc, as the level of other target genes such as p21 also
followed a similar pattern (data not shown).

CEA Inhibits TGF-β Signaling

Impairment of TGF-β signaling in colorectal cancer
cells with elevated CEA
To determine the functional significance of the interaction
between CEA and TGF-β signaling in colorectal tumorigenesis, we first assessed the possible existence of a correlation
between the levels of CEA and TGF-β–induced Smad3 phosphorylation in 12 colorectal cancer cell lines. The extent of
Smad3 phosphorylation was measured by the fold increase
of p-Smad3 (ratio of p-Smad3 on TGF-β stimulation to the
basal p-Smad3 levels). The cell lines were classified into three
groups based on the levels of CEA expression. As seen in
Fig. 3A, there was an inverse correlation between the levels
of CEA and the degree of Smad3 phosphorylation (P < 0.05).
To corroborate these findings, we treated colorectal cancer
cells LS180 with anti-CEA antibody to block CEA before stimulating the cells with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 3B, nuclear
translocation of Smad3 was enhanced in cells treated with
the anti-CEA antibody. Consistent with these results, we
found that blocking CEA action with antibody also restored

the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on c-myc transcription (Fig. 3C).
Finally, we showed that the anti-CEA antibody was also
able to block transcription from a c-myc-promoter-luc reporter system (Fig. 3D), presumably due to an enhanced recruitment of Smad-3 to the c-myc-gene chromatin (Fig. 3E)
in TGF-β–stimulated HCT116 cells. To show a potential direct binding of Smad3 to the human c-myc promoter, we
next performed EMSA using a PCR product encompassing
the −5 to −233 region of the c-myc promoter and nuclear extracts from HCT 116 cells with or without TGF-β stimulation
in the presence of either IgG or CEA antibody. As expected
from the preceding results, TGF-β stimulation of HCT116
cells in the presence of CEA antibody promoted Smad3/
DNA complex formation (Fig. 3F, lanes 11–13) compared
with those in the presence of IgG antibody (Fig. 3F, lanes
5–7). The specificity of the noted complex was further verified by supershift experiments using anti-Samd3 (Fig. 3F,
lane 12) or control IgG (Fig. 3F, lane 13). Collectively, these
findings suggest that elevated levels of CEA may counteract

colorectal cancer cell lines with augmented CEA levels were
treated with TGF-β and different doses of anti-CEA antibody
as indicated. Anti-CEA antibody enhanced TGF-β–mediated
growth inhibition of target cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4B). For further confirmation, we suppressed CEA expression with specific siRNA, and then treated the cells with
TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 4C, treating cells with siRNA targeting CEA rescued the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.

cells.
Targeting CEA restores the inhibitory effects of TGF-β
signaling on proliferation of colorectal cancer cells
TGF-β signaling plays an important role in suppressing
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (24). However, some cancer cells lose their responses to the proliferation-inhibiting
effects of TGF-β signaling during development. In addition
to the mutations of TGF-β receptors or Smads, we assume
that increased CEA may also contribute to the loss of response to TGF-β signaling as supported by data in the preceding paragraph. To test this hypothesis, we next carried
out proliferation assay using colorectal cells stably transfected either with the control pcDNA vector or with plasmid
encoding CEA (17). We assessed the effects of CEA on the
inhibition of proliferation induced by TGF-β in the presence
or absence of anti-CEA antibody. In cells transfected with
vector, TGF-β treatment led to ∼20% proliferation inhibition.
Interestingly, the combination of TGF-β and anti-CEA antibody had similar effects as using TGF-β alone. In contrast, in
cells transfected with CEA, TGF-β treatment had little effect
on cell proliferation. However, when combined with the antiCEA antibody, TGF-β remarkably reduced cell proliferation
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4A). This result strongly suggests that targeting
CEA may restore the tumor-suppressing effects of TGF-β in
some colorectal cancer cells. To confirm this finding, three

CEA enhances liver metastasis of colorectal cancer cells
Previous studies have shown that CEA enhances liver
metastasis of colorectal cancer cells in animal experiments
(16, 17, 33). To corroborate the role of CEA in liver metastasis,
colorectal cancer cells stably transfected with CEA expression
plasmid or pcDNA were injected intrasplenically into nude
mice (2 × 106 viable cells per animal, n = 10 animal each
group). Mice were autopsied to determine spleen and liver
colonization 30 days postinjection. As shown in Fig. 5, CEA
enhanced both liver and spleen colonization of the cancer
cells. Liver metastasis was detected in 50% of recipients of
cells transfected with CEA. In contrast, liver colonies were
found in only 10% of recipients of control cells (P < 0.05).

Discussion
Increased CEA levels are observed in a wide variety of
human cancers such as colon, breast, and lung cancers.
Previous studies have shown that CEA contributes to
tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell differentiation and anoikis
(8–13, 17, 19). Interestingly, CEA is a GPI-linked protein that
lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (34–36),
which suggests that CEA has to exert these effects by modulating other signaling pathways. It was reported that CEA
mediated anoikis inhibition through integrin (37, 38) and
DR5 signaling (17, 39). Here, we report that CEA directly
binds to TBRI and inhibits the TGF-β signaling pathway.
Our data show that CEA binds to TBRI but not TBRII, and
that these two molecules colocalize on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Our findings that CEA overexpression attenuates TGF-β signaling (Fig. 2) are significant as they imply
that CEA can contribute to tumor development and progress
by downregulating the TGF-β signaling pathway. Although a
dual role of TGF-β in cancers has been noted, the genetic and
mechanistic basis for gastrointestinal cancers has remained
elusive. There is considerable genetic evidence that the TGF-β
signaling pathway is a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal
epithelial cells. First, the TGF-β signaling pathway has a
major influence on cell lineage determination and terminal
differentiation, and suppresses tumorigenesis by driving
precursor cells into a less proliferative state (40). Second,
TGF-β can induce apoptosis through both Smad-dependent
and Smad-independent mechanisms (41). These mechanisms
include the induction of multiple proapoptotic factors, such
as the signaling factor GADD45b, the death-associated protein kinase DAPK, the death receptor FAS, and the proapoptotic effector BIM. Moreover, Smad interaction with the
Akt pathway and TGF-β receptor interaction with the p38

CEA Inhibits TGF-β Signaling

mitogen-activated protein kinase activator DAXX have also
been proposed as alternative mechanisms of the proapoptotic effects of TGF-β (24). Given these tumor-suppressing effects of TGF-β, inhibition of TGF-β signaling by augmented
CEA may be of high significance in colorectal tumorigenesis.
The role of TGF-β signaling in colorectal tumorigenesis has
been recognized over the past decade. There is growing
evidence that TGF-β signaling alterations mediated by
microsatellite instability (MSI) contribute to colon cancer
development and progression. MSI contributes to the TGF-β
signaling resistance of colorectal cancer by resultant mutations of TGF-β receptors or Smads. Here, we provide evidence that TGF-β signaling alterations may also be mediated
by enhanced CEA level. This can explain why some colorectal
cancer cells can still escape the inhibitory effects of TGF-β
signaling without detectable mutations or polymorphisms
of TGF-β receptors or Smads. Around 80% of all microsatellite instable colorectal cancers contain mutations in TBRII. In
these cases, targeting CEA will not be able to rescue TGF-β
response due to the impaired TGF-β signaling. However, for
some microsatellite instable cells in which the components
of TGF-β signaling pathway are not mutated, targeting
CEA can also rescue TGF-β response.
Development of liver metastasis is a frequent complication
in the course of gastrointestinal malignancies. In support of
a role of CEA in the process of liver metastasis, we provide
experimental data supporting the notion that CEA increases
the survival of cancer cells in both local colonization and
distant metastasis (Fig. 5). After entering the liver via portal
circulation, cancer cells are encountered by Kupffer cells in
the liver sinusoids (42). Kupffer cells represent 10% of all liver
cells, and have the ability to kill tumor cells. As such, these
cells may have an intrinsic role in the protection against
outgrowth of hepatic metastasis. The cytotoxic function of

Kupffer cells is regulated by multiple cytokines. Functionally,
TGF-β was found to be chemotactic for Kupffer cells and to
regulate Kupffer cell functions (43). In addition to inhibiting
TGF-β signaling in cancer cells, it is possible that CEA produced by cancer cells may also affect TGF-β signaling in
Kupffer cells and thereby enhance the metastatic potential
of tumor cells. However, this possibility needs to be experimentally tested.
In colorectal cancer cells with augmented CEA expression,
targeting CEA with specific antibody or siRNA can rescue
TGF-β response. Increase of CEA expression and alteration
of TGF-β signaling are commonly observed in colorectal
cancers. Our study provides insight into understanding how
these two important events interact with each other during
tumorigenesis. Because CEA is a frequently overexpressed
tumor-associated antigen in tumors, specific antibodies
targeting CEA have been developed as a novel therapeutic
approach for treatment of tumors expressing CEA on their
surface (44–47). In this context, the results presented here
offer new opportunity to combine CEA antibody and TGF-β
to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer.
