BACKGROUND. High-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment for patients with chemosensitive relapsed/
refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), but this therapy is commonly denied to
patients with resistant disease. We explored the utility of HDT and ASCT for chemoresistant HL because there are few established therapies for these patients.

METHODS. Sixty-four chemoresistant HL patients underwent HDT followed by
ASCT at our center. Baseline characteristics included median age 5 35 years
(range, 14-59 years), stage III/IV 5 49 (77%), nodular sclerosis histology 5 51
(80%), and prior radiation 5 32 (50%). Twenty-six patients (41%) received total
body irradiation (TBI)-based regimens, and 38 (59%) underwent non-TBI condi-

ver 7500 patients are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)
each year in the United States, with 70% to 90% achieving cure
with initial therapy.1-3 Patients with early relapse or primary refractory disease have a much worse prognosis, with long-term diseasefree survival rates reported at 5% to 20% if they are treated with
conventional salvage chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone.4,5 Over
the past 2 decades several phase 2 trials, numerous case series from
bone marrow transplant registries, and 2 phase 3 trials have established high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by autologous stem cell
transplantation (ASCT) as the preferred treatment for these highrisk patients in chemosensitive relapse, with cure rates around 40%
to 60%.6-14

ASCT in Resistant Hodgkin Lymphoma/Gopal et al

Several series have identified chemoresistant disease as a negative prognostic factor for survival in
HL patients undergoing HDT and ASCT, and many
centers therefore deny this treatment to HL patients
that do not achieve at least a partial response to salvage therapy.1,12,13,15-19 The current study reviewed
our experience treating patients who have chemoresistant HL with HDT and ASCT to better define the
overall efficacy in this setting and to attempt to identify characteristics associated with improved overall
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were identified from the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center (Seattle, Wash) computerized
database. Clinical and research records of all HL
patients were reviewed, and only those with chemoresistant disease were included in this analysis.
Patients were considered to have chemoresistant HL
if they achieved less than a partial remission (less
than 50% reduction in tumor bulk) with the salvage
chemotherapy regimen administered immediately
preceding conditioning for ASCT. All patients provided informed consent for treatment on transplant
protocols approved by the appropriate institutional
review board. In addition, separate institutional approval was obtained to retrospectively gather data
from patient records and databases.

Study Variables
The specific variables evaluated included age, sex,
stage, histology, tumor bulk at transplant, date of
transplant, number of extranodal sites (ENS), number of prior chemotherapy regimens, prior radiotherapy (RT), use of total body irradiation (TBI)
conditioning, and stem cell source. Tumor bulk was
defined based on the greatest long-axis diameter of
the largest tumor mass by computerized tomography
noted after salvage therapy and before initiation of
transplant conditioning. Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG)
positron emission tomography (PET) results were
gathered before transplant when performed but were
not used to define chemosensitivity. A prior regimen
was defined as 1 or more cycles of specific chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Definition of Endpoints and Statistical Analysis
OS and PFS were computed from the date of stem
cell infusion to the date of death or progression
using the method of Kaplan and Meier.20 Events for
the endpoint of OS consisted of death from any
cause, whereas events for PFS consisted of death
from any cause or progressive disease. Univariate

and Multivariate Cox regression models were fit to
examine the association between various factors and
the outcomes of OS and PFS. Reported 2-sided
P-values from regression models were obtained from
the Wald test, and no adjustments were made for
multiple comparisons.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Between November 1981 and May 2005, we treated
167 patients with HL using HDT and ASCT at our
center, with 64 (38%) of these patients meeting the
definition of chemoresistant disease. Baseline characteristics for this group are summarized in Table 1. In
addition, front-line chemotherapy consisted of Adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine,
and dacarbazine (ABVD) in 25 patients, an ABVD/
mechlorethamine, oncovin, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) hybrid in 22 patients, MOPP in 5
patients, Stanford V in 3 patients, other ABVD
hybrids in 2 patients, and a combination of other
therapies in 7 patients. Twenty-nine patients (45%)

were refractory to their initial chemotherapy regimen.
The median number of prior regimens was 2 (range
1-5). Thirty-two patients (50%) had received prior RT,
and all patients had a Southwest Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 before transplant. Eight
patients had PET imaging before conditioning; of
these, 7 had FDG-avid foci of active disease.
Regimens immediately before transplant to
which the HL was deemed resistant included ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide in 14 patients,
dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin
(DHAP) in 9 patients, MOPP/ABVD in 7 patients, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and dexamethasone in 7
patients, ABVD in 4 patients, MOPP in 3 patients,
and COPP in 2 patients, with the remaining 18
patients receiving 17 various other regimens. When
all prior regimens were assessed for responses in
each patient, 40 (63%) patients were found to be resistant to anthracyclines, 33 (52%) to high-dose alkylating
agents
(cyclophosphamide
[CY]
and
ifosfamide), 33 (52%) to platinum (cisplatin and carboplatin), and 19 (30%) to high-dose cytarabine.

Conditioning Regimens and Stem Cell Sources
Twenty-six patients (41%) were treated with TBIbased preparatory regimens, including 23 patients receiving TBI/CY/etoposide (VP16) and 3 patients
treated with CY/TBI. The remaining 38 patients
(59%) were treated with chemotherapy-only regimens
including busulfan (Bu)/melphalan (Mel)/thiotepa
(TT) (n 5 18), carmustine/CY/VP-16 (n 5 12), Bu/CY
(n 5 3), carmustine/VP-16/cytararbine/Mel (n 5 3),
Bu/TT (n 5 1), and Bu/CY/lithium (n 5 1). Twentyfour patients received autologous bone marrow, 39
received autologous mobilized peripheral blood stem
cells (PBSC), and 1 received both.
OS and PFS
The 5-year OS and PFS were estimated to be 31%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-44%) and 17%
(95% CI, 6%-27%), respectively, with median followup of 4.2 years (range 1-16.2 years) among surviving
patients (Fig. 1). At the last follow-up, 21 patients
(33%) were alive, and 13 (20%) were alive and progression-free. Thirty of the 43 deaths during this
study period followed relapse. Nonrelapse causes of
death included respiratory failure (5 patients), infections (2 patients), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/
myelodysplasia (2 patients), hepatic toxicity (1
patient), renal failure (1 patient), and unknown
causes (2 patients). Therapy for the 8 patients surviving after relapse included nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation (3 patients), chemotherapy
alone (2 patients), chemotherapy and radiation

(1 patient), radiation alone (1 patient), and surgical
resection (1 patient). Of the 7 patients with positive
PET imaging pretransplant, 4 are alive and progression-free 5 months to 2.1 years after transplant, 1
died of AML without relapse of HL at 4 years, and 2
suffered progression at 5 and 9 months, respectively.
The 1 patient with a negative PET is alive and progression-free at 2.6 years.

Univariate and Multivariate Analyses
Hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality from univariate
analyses included mixed cellularity histology, 0.42
(95% CI, 0.16-1.07, P 5 .07 vs all other); prior radiation, 2.05 (95% CI, 1.11-3.79, P 5 .02); male sex, 1.05
(95% CI, 0.57-1.92, P 5 .88); use of TBI, 0.65 (95% CI,
0.34-1.21, P 5 .17); use of bone marrow–derived stem
cells, 1.85 (95% CI, 1.01-3.38, P 5 .05); 2 ENS of disease, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.03-4.29, P 5 .04); and tumor
bulk 5 cm, 1.39 (95% CI, 0.75-2.56, P 5 .30). The
HR for death for stage III disease was 0.94 (95% CI,
0.39-2.27, P 5 .89) and for stage IV it was 1.13 (95%
CI, 0.54-2.38, P 5 .75) when compared with patients
with stage I/II disease. Age at transplant (P 5 .30)
and number of cycles of previous chemotherapy
(P 5 .79) were not statistically significantly associated
with mortality in univariate models when evaluated
as a continuous linear variable. In contrast, the year
of transplant was correlated with mortality, with
improved survival occurring after more recent transplants (P 5 .008). After adjusting for year of transplant, none of the other factors was statistically
significantly associated with OS, whereas year of
transplant remained associated with survival even after adjusting for the other factors (Table 2). Similar
results were observed when PFS was evaluated, with

no other factors statistically significantly associated
with outcome after adjusting for year of transplant,
and later transplants being associated with improved
PFS (P 5 .04). The presence of >1 ENS of disease
approached statistical significance for PFS when
adjusted for transplant year (HR 5 1.89 [95% CI,
0.92-3.88], P 5 .08).
Because of the strong correlation between era of
transplant and source of stem cells (all recent transplants were done with PBSC), we evaluated the
impact of year of transplant within and between the
PBSC (August 1993-2005) and bone marrow (1986July 1993) periods (Table 3. OS appeared to improve
over time within both the bone marrow and the peripheral blood stem cell source eras, as did PFS,
although the only statistically significant differences

1347

were between the most recent and most distant time
periods (OS P 5 .003, PFS P 5 .02). The absolute risk
of relapse in general decreased over time, although
demonstration of statistically significant differences
was likely limited by the small number of events.
The estimated probabilities of 3-year survival for
patients receiving transplants during 1986 to 1989,
1990 to July 1993, August 1993 to 1999, and 1999 to
2005 were 9%, 36%, 33%, and 49%, respectively (Fig.
2). Likewise, the estimated 3-year PFS for patients
receiving transplants during 1986 to 1989, 1990 to
July 1993, August 1993 to 1999, and 1999 to 2005
were 9%, 21%, 33%, and 31%, respectively (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
Chemoresistant HL continues to represent a challenge
for clinicians. Several series have repeatedly identified
chemoresistance before ASCT as a major adverse
prognostic factor for HL, and thus, many patients
whose disease displays this feature are currently
denied ASCT.1,12,13,15-19 Our study sought to specifically evaluate the outcomes of these patients after
ASCT and potentially define a cohort that could attain
prolonged remission and survival. Despite chemoresistance, the estimated the 5-year OS and PFS were 31%
and 17%, respectively, suggesting a meaningful clinical
benefit may be afforded to about 1 in 6 patients.
Multivariate analysis identified the year of transplant as a major predictor of survival, with patients
receiving transplants more recently having improved
outcomes. The estimated OS and PFS at 3 years was
49% and 31%, respectively, among patients treated in
the last 5 years as compared with a 9% 3-year OS
and PFS in the earliest time period. Assessment of
the impact of both transplant era and stem cell
source on outcome suggested that the improvement
cannot be attributed solely to the use of PBSC, as the
OS and PFS among BM versus PBSC patients are
similar in the 2 time windows that span the change
in stem cell source (1989-1999). One could postulate
that the etiology of these improvements is likely multifactorial, including both more effective supportive
care and refined patient selection, although the retrospective nature of this study prevented confirmation of this hypothesis. For example, differentiating
outcomes based on the exact percent response or
progression in these chemoresistant cases after salvage therapy was not within the scope of this project,
but may have had a major impact on outcome. It is
possible that transplants in the most recent era took
place in a larger proportion of patients with minor
responses to cytoreductive chemotherapy than those
in earlier eras. Improvements in OS could also arise

from improved postrelapse therapies, as 3 individuals
that attained prolonged survival after relapse in our
series underwent nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation, and 3 others had their disease effectively
controlled with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
Most importantly, our recent data can be more
useful than more distant historical results in counseling those with chemoresistant HL about prognosis after ASCT, as 1 third of the patients in our series
receiving transplants since August 1993 were expected
to be alive and progression-free at 3 years. Similarly,
these findings would also suggest that caution should
be used when comparing outcomes from novel transplant regimens in HL to historical data, as superior
results may not be solely because of a change in the
intervention being studied. Along these lines, we were
not able to directly compare transplant outcomes in
this patient population with best available nontransplant therapies, leaving definitive conclusions to
future prospective randomized comparisons.
Despite the finding that some of our patients
with resistant HL attained prolonged PFS, new effective approaches are critically needed in this population, as the vast majority will still relapse and die of
their disease. Recent data suggest that gemcitabine-

based regimens can induce remissions in patients
that have not responded to more traditional salvage

therapies.21,22
responses could both improve outcomes via tumor
debulking and better identify disease that may
respond to high-dose therapies. Individuals with resistant disease could be considered for investigational strategies using novel agents such as antiCD30 monoclonal antibodies or transplants via
reduced intensity allografting or tandem ASCT.23-28
Future directions should also attempt to take advantage of the radiosensitivity of HL by means of
radioimmunotherapy-based transplant-conditioning
regimens, as has been successfully used in nonHodgkin lymphoma.29-32 Furthermore, optimized
patient selection with the use of PET may also yield
refined risk stratification and determine who may
benefit the most from ASCT and who should proceed
directly to other therapies. Prior series have suggested that lymphoma patients with computed tomography (CT)-defined chemoresistant disease but
PET negativity may have comparable outcomes to
those with CT-defined responsive disease after
ASCT.33,34 Unfortunately, the small number of individuals that had pretransplant PET imaging in our se-

ASCT in Resistant Hodgkin Lymphoma/Gopal et al

ries limited our ability to test this hypothesis. Nevertheless, 7 of 8 patients did have PET scanning that
revealed residual disease, with only 2 of these 7
experiencing relapse thus far.
Until novel effective therapies are developed, the
outcome for individuals with chemoresistant HL will
continue to be limited. Our data suggest that high-dose
therapy and ASCT could be considered for and will likely
benefit a significant subset of patients with HL, with
nearly 1 in 3 patients receiving transplants in the last
decade achieving prolonged remissions and survival.
Longer follow-up of patients recently having received
transplants and results from other similar cohorts of
patients having received and not having received transplants will be needed to confirm these findings.
