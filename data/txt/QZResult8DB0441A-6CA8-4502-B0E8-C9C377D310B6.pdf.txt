BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are key regulators of apoptosis and are frequently dysregulated in ovarian cancer. It was hypothesized that blocking IAPs with birinapant would increase tumor cell death and result in objective responses for women
with platinum-refractory and -resistant ovarian cancer. METHODS: In this phase 2, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program–sponsored
study, patients received birinapant at 47 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetics were obtained during cycle 1.
Plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and percutaneous tumor biopsy samples were collected before cycle 1 and after
6 weeks. The primary endpoint was an objective response or progression-free survival lasting greater than 6 months in a mini-max
design. RESULTS: Eleven patients received birinapant; after this, accrual was terminated for lack of a clinical benefit. Birinapant was
well tolerated, with predominantly grade 2 adverse events and 1 case of grade 3 lymphopenia. Pretreatment biopsy samples and
PBMCs were collected; paired posttreatment biopsy samples and PBMCs were collected from 7 and 10 patients, respectively. There
was consistent downregulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 in tumors (P 5.016) and PBMCs (P <.01). Procaspase 3 also
decreased in tumors (P 5.031) and PBMCs (P <.01); cleaved caspase 3 colocalized with H2A histone family member X (g-H2AX) in
tumors after birinapant exposure. Peripheral T and B cells decreased significantly after treatment, but natural killer cells did not

INTRODUCTION
Advances in therapy over the past several decades have translated into small improvements in 5-year survival for women
with ovarian cancer.1 The need for novel therapies targeting chemoresistant cells is underscored by the high rate of recurrence with conventional chemotherapy. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated process that is commonly dysregulated in cancer. Apoptosis signaling follows 2 pathways: intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death
receptor-ligand). Intracellular damage triggers the intrinsic pathway and results in altered mitochondrial membrane

tion, and antiapoptosis gene expression. Our laboratory
previously demonstrated autonomous activation of
NF-jB in ovarian cancers.14 In addition, ovarian cancers
are associated with elevated TNF-a,15,16 a factor that can
mediate either prosurvival or prodeath signaling.17 In the
presence of cIAPs, TNF-a activates prosurvival NF-jB
signaling upon binding to its receptor. In the absence of
cIAPs, however, TNF-a activates caspase 8 and extrinsic
apoptosis.18,19 We, therefore, hypothesized that by inhibiting cIAPs, birinapant had the potential to be an effective
therapy for ovarian cancer. This single-agent, phase 2 clinical trial evaluated the drug’s mechanism of action and
identified key pharmacodynamic markers for future clinical trials. Understanding such parameters is essential for
moving birinapant forward clinically in rationally selected
combinations with standard and/or novel anticancer
therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

permeability and the subsequent release of cytochrome c
and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases
(SMAC). The release of cytochrome c and SMAC promotes apoptosome formation and degradation of inhibitors
of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), respectively.2 Ultimately, apoptosis pathways converge on a common platform of cellular
destruction mediated by caspase 3 and 7 activation.
Increasing evidence suggests that defective apoptosis
is linked with chemotherapy resistance.3,4 Thus, nodes in
apoptotic signaling have rapidly become targets of interest
for novel cancer therapy development. IAPs bind caspases
and block their proapoptotic function.5 IAPs are frequently dysregulated in ovarian cancer,6 and exploiting
the IAP-caspase interaction may be a logical strategy for
anticancer drug development.
SMAC is an endogenous IAP antagonist released
from mitochondria upon cell death signaling.7 SMAC
mimetics are designed to bind IAPs by mimicking the
N-terminal Ala-Val-Pro-Ile tetrapeptide sequence of
SMAC.8 SMAC mimetics have shown preclinical activity
in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.9-11
Birinapant is a divalent SMAC mimetic specifically
designed to target cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins
(cIAPs) cIAP1 and cIAP2. In preclinical models, birinapant depleted cIAPs, activated caspase 3, and inhibited tumor cell growth.12cIAPs are unique among the IAP
proteins in their ability to promote nuclear factor jB
(NF-jB) activation downstream of cell surface receptors
such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor.13 Activation of NF-jB causes cancer cell proliferation, inflammaCancer

Patients

Eligible women were 18 years old with histologically confirmed, relapsed, platinum-refractory or -resistant epithelial
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)), with the disease
measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (version 1.1)20 and amenable to percutaneous
core-needle biopsy. Platinum-refractory was defined as progression of disease while a platinum was being received,
and platinum-resistant was defined as progression of disease
within 6 months of the completion of platinum therapy.
There was no limitation to prior therapy. Other criteria
included adequate end organ function, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status  2, and a minimum of 4 weeks since the previous therapy. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,
approved by the institutional review board at the National
Cancer Institute, and registered with Clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01681368). All patients provided written, informed
consent at study enrollment.
Treatment Plan

This was an open-label, nonrandomized, phase 2 trial of
the SMAC mimetic birinapant (TL32711; National Service Center (NSC) 756502). Birinapant at 47 mg/m2 was
administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day
cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
patient withdrawal (Fig. 1). Patients were evaluated every 4
weeks; laboratory studies were completed before each birinapant infusion and as clinically indicated. The response
was monitored by computed tomography scanning every 2

cycles according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (version 1.1).20 Cancer antigen 125 was
recorded but was not a measure of response. Toxicity was
assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Dose reductions were
indicated for adverse events of grade 3 or higher (see online
supporting information).
Translational Endpoints
Sample acquisition

Whole blood was collected into heparin tubes, separated
into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) components with a Ficoll gradient, aliquoted,
and stored separately at 2808C until use. PBMCs were collected before the administration of birinapant and 4 and 24
hours after the first dose; additional paired specimens were
collected before the cycle 2, day 15 dose (C2D15) and 4
hours afterward. Percutaneous tumor biopsy samples were
collected before the initiation of cycle 1 (C1) and within
the first 12 to 24 hours after C2D15. Four cores were
obtained; cores 1 and 3 were immediately flash-frozen and
stored in liquid nitrogen, and cores 2 and 4 were fixed in
formalin and paraffin-embedded. The time from core
acquisition to the storage condition (liquid nitrogen or formalin) was uniformly less than 30 seconds.
Pharmacokinetic assessments

Birinapant concentrations within a tumor were assessed
from core 3 (frozen) percutaneous tumor biopsy samples at
each time point. Plasma samples obtained on C1, day 1
(before dosing and 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after the
infusion) were used to assess circulating birinapant pharmacokinetics. Both tumor and plasma birinapant concentrations were analyzed with liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry via a proprietary methodology (TetraLogic Pharma, Malvern, Pa). A noncompartmental analysis
was performed with Phoenix WinNonlin 6.4 (Certara
Pharsight, Cary, NC) to obtain individual pharmacokinetic
parameters. A predicted mean plasma concentration–time
curve was obtained with a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Graphical and statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 6).
Pharmacodynamic assessments

Core 1 tumor samples and PBMCs from each time point
were lysed in T-PER buffer (Thermo Scientific) for protein quantification by an automated capillary electrophoresis immunoassay system (Simple Western). The tumor
protein lysate (40-60 ng) or PBMC protein lysate
(16-77 ng) was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s
590

instructions (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, Calif). Primary
antibody sources are listed in the online supporting information. The reproducibility of this assay has been demonstrated in clinical samples.21,22
Core 4 was subjected to deparaffinization and endogenous peroxidase blocking; antigen retrieval was performed with a citrate buffer. Sections (5 mm) were stained
with antibodies against cleaved caspase 3 (MAB835;
R&D Systems; 10 mg/mL) and biotinylated H2A Histone
family member X (c-H2AX) (16-193; Millipore; 10 mg/
mL), and they were detected with an anti-rabbit secondary
antibody to Alexa 546 and streptavidin Alexa 680, respectively. 40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstained
nuclei. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio ScanScope FL under constant illumination and exposure settings. Field selection used a 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole channel to minimize the selection bias. Postimage enhancement was used for visualization and was
applied uniformly across the images. Segmented nuclei
were analyzed on the basis of the mean intensity threshold
in the c-H2AX channel. Nuclei above a predetermined
threshold were considered positive.
PBMCs were characterized by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting for T cells (CD3 and CD4 or CD8), B cells
(CD19), and natural killer cells (CD561, CD161, CD45bright, CD3–). Plasma was analyzed for interleukin 6 (IL-6),
IL-8, tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), and TNF-a cytokines per the manufacturer’s instructions (MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, MD).
Statistical Design and Analysis

The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (confirmed partial or complete response) or progression-free
survival lasting 6 months.23 Secondary objectives
included overall survival, tolerability and safety, and the
impact on molecular signaling. A modified 2-stage design24
was implemented with a maximum of 40 participants; this
gave 89% power (a 5 .05) to detect a true objective
response rate of at least 20% and 85% power to detect a
true 6-month progression-free survival rate of at least 45%.
The endpoints are those set out by the Gynecologic Oncology Group and deemed to be the minimum bar required to
determine that an agent is worthy of further study in the
platinum-refractory and -resistant ovarian cancer population.23 The first stage of accrual required >1 objective
response (5%) and >5 instances of 6-month progressionfree survival (25%) among the initial 20 participants to
continue to the second stage. At least 5 objective responses
(12.5%) or at least 15 instances of 6-month progressionfree survival (37.5%) were necessary among the 40

evaluable study participants for consideration of further
testing as single-agent therapy for ovarian cancer.
Secondary endpoints were analyzed with exploratory
intent. A true population prevalence of 40% was assumed
for a particular biomarker; 39 study participants were
required to estimate this prevalence with a 10% error rate
and 80% confidence. All exploratory comparisons were
performed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test because of
the nonnormal distribution of a small number of samples;
P < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Patients and Outcomes

Eleven patients were enrolled. Birinapant achieved no
clinical benefit in the first 11 patients. The best response
was disease stabilization in 2 patients (4 and 5 months).
The cancer antigen 125 tumor marker showed varying
trends across patients (Supporting Figure 1 [see online
supporting information]). The statistical design allowed
20 patients in the first stage, with at least 2 patients attaining an objective response and at least 6 patients maintaining stable disease for greater than 6 months. This design
would require 8 of the next 9 patients to achieve a clinical
benefit to proceed to the second stage of accrual. After discussions with the study sponsor, we determined this to be
an unrealistic goal and closed accrual at 11 patients to
limit exposure to possible toxicity and risks associated

with biopsies with an extremely low likelihood of clinical
benefit. The median age of the patients was 59 years,
82% were white, 54.5% had serous ovarian cancer histology, and the median number of prior therapies was 5
(Table 1).
Birinapant was well tolerated, with predominantly
grade 2 adverse events, 1 case of grade 3 lymphopenia, and
no grade 4 or 5 adverse events (Table 2). No adverse events
required dose reduction. One patient experienced grade 2
Bell’s palsy; a neurologic examination demonstrated palsy
of bilateral cranial nerve VII, right cranial nerve VI, and left
cranial nerve V one week after the second infusion during
C1. Bell’s palsy was reported in other clinical trials using
birinapant and thus was not unexpected. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated faint enhancement of the left
optic nerve without other significant findings. The patient
received oral prednisolone at 60 mg daily for 7 days, which
was followed by a taper over 7 days, and the symptoms
resolved completely. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected during the diagnostic evaluation, and the patient consented to
additional measurements of birinapant in the cerebrospinal
fluid. Interestingly, birinapant was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (0.0711 ng/mL). The C1, day 15 dose was
held, and cycle 2 was delayed 1 week, as permitted by the
protocol. This patient was retreated with 3 additional
weekly doses of birinapant without a dose reduction to
complete cycle 2 and experienced no further adverse events.

after the administration of the first dose, and the expected pharmacokinetics were followed in all patients. The heavy black dots
represent the observed plasma concentrations, and the dashed line represents the predicted birinapant plasma concentration at
a dosage of 47 mg/m2 in a phase 1 study (n 5 11). (B) Levels of birinapant were measured in core-needle biopsy samples of
tumors that had been frozen at the time of acquisition. Paired samples before treatment and after cycle 2 were obtained for
7 patients. No birinapant was detected in any of the pre-exposure biopsy samples, and birinapant was measurable in all but
1 biopsy sample obtained after the cycle 2, day 15 dose. (C–E) The birinapant CL and Vss correlated with each other and were
influenced by the body WT. CL indicates clearance; Vss, volume of distribution at steady state; WT, weight.

Pharmacokinetics

The drug concentration was evaluated in both the plasma
and the tumor. Plasma birinapant concentrations were
measured after the C1 infusion (Fig. 2A). Sparse sampling
in our study limited true pharmacokinetic profiling.
Observed exposures, however, were consistent with those
reported in a previous study (Amaravadi et al, in press).25
Percutaneous tumor biopsy was performed before the initiation of C1 in 11 patients; a second tumor biopsy was performed within the first 12 to 22 hours after the C2D15
infusion in 7 of those patients, and the birinapant concentrations were measured. Although there was no direct comparison of plasma and tumor concentrations on C2D15,
tumor concentrations ranged from 185 to 1830 ng of birinapant/g of tissue (Fig. 2B) as late as 22 hours after the
592

dose. The limited sample size prevented an accurate description of birinapant’s true pharmacokinetic profile, which has
demonstrated triphasic elimination (Amaravadi et al, in
press). Our observations, based on limited sampling and a
limited sample size, however, are consistent with birinapant
having at least a biphasic disposition: the early phase
involves birinapant tissue distribution, which is followed by
slower terminal phase elimination. The calculated volume
of distribution at steady state (Vss) of 119 L further supports the claim of extensive birinapant distribution into tissues because this was much larger than normal plasma
volumes (5-7 L). Our data suggest that the drug remains
much longer in the tumor versus plasma, where it is rapidly
cleared (68 L/h). This longer half-life in the tumor is consistent with a more comprehensive data set, based on which

tumors. (A) Protein lysates from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at the indicated time points after birinapant
administration showed a rapid and sustained loss of birinapant’s primary target, cIAP1, as measured with the Simple Western
assay. Similar measurements of procaspase 3 and p-S529–NF-jB–p65 showed similar patterns of downregulation at 24 hours.
(B) A Simple Western analysis of protein lysates from tumor biopsy samples consistently showed a loss of cIAP1 after birinapant.
Procaspase 3 decreased after birinapant, and this suggested cleavage. The ratio of phosphorylated NF-jB–p65 protein to total

and the clearance (r2 5 0.574, P 5 .007; Fig. 2C–E). Furthermore, dose normalization to the body surface area produced comparable exposures in the 11 patients (Supporting

Pharmacodynamic Studies
Cell survival and apoptosis

We sought to determine the on-target activity of birinapant in PBMCs and tumor specimens by investigating
both downregulation of antiapoptotic pathways and initiation of proapoptotic cascades. We measured the direct
target, cIAP, as well as procaspase 3 as a marker of apoptosis induction and phosphorylated NF-jB–p65, which
represented the known role of IAPs in NF-jB signaling.
The Simple Western assay allows quantification of multi594

ple proteins from minute volumes of a sample. Adequate
assay sensitivity and reproducibility have been demonstrated with highly quantitative data in both laboratory
and clinical samples.26 Birinapant induced rapid degradation of cIAP1, the primary target, in serial PBMC protein
lysates (Fig. 3A). Procaspase 3 and phosphorylated NFjB–p65 also showed downregulation in PBMCs 24 hours
after birinapant administration (Fig. 3A).
In core-needle biopsy samples of tumors, cIAP1
showed a downward trend consistent with the on-target

activity of birinapant (n 5 7, P 5 .016; Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, cIAP1 was not uniformly high but was measured
across a wide concentration range among the specimens.
For the majority of patients, cIAP2 signals were below the
limits of detection for accurate quantification (not
shown). Procaspase 3 was significantly decreased after
birinapant, and this suggests that its cleavage may have
occurred; the assay did not detect the cleaved form
(P 5 .031; Fig. 3B). Phosphorylated NF-jB–p65 trended
toward significance (P 5 .078; Fig. 3B). Other NF-jB
markers that were tested included inhibitor of kappaB
(IjBa), NF-jB–p50, NF-jB–p52, NF-jB–p100, NFjB–p105, poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase, cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), and receptor interacting protein (RIP); none demonstrated
significant changes (not shown).
We developed an immunohistochemistry assay to
measure the coexpression of cleaved caspase 3 and cH2AX in fixed specimens. Core 4 (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tumor biopsy was used to measure the
coexpression of these proteins as a surrogate for early apoptosis. Only 2 pairs of adequate pre- and posttreatment
biopsy samples were available for analysis. The remaining
paired samples were inadequate for immunohistochemistry because of necrotic debris in the posttreatment biopsy
sample (1 specimen) or contamination with blood (4
specimens). This finding suggests that 4 cores may exceed
the limit for obtaining high-quality specimens for molecular analyses. In the usable tissues, the percentage of
dually positive cells increased approximately 2- and 4-fold
after birinapant administration, and this was consistent
with early apoptotic activity (Fig. 3C).
Immune parameters

We assessed whether birinapant modulated the composition
of circulating immune cells because of the proposed effects
of birinapant on NF-jB signaling and the overwhelming
importance of NF-jB in immune cells. Indeed, dosedependent lymphocytopenia was observed in previous studies with birinapant (Amaravadi et al, in press). PBMCs were
analyzed for T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer–cell counts. All
T-cell subsets decreased after exposure to birinapant
(P 5 .04-0.09; Fig. 4A). B cells also decreased (P 5 .05),
and no significant change in natural killer cells was observed
(P 5 .43; Fig. 4B). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio has
been proposed as a general marker of inflammation in cancer.18 The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio showed variable
trends across patients but followed no consistent pattern
(Fig. 4C).

Plasma collected before C1 and after C2D15 was
analyzed for IL-6, IL-8, TRAIL, and TNF-a cytokines.
Interestingly, a trend toward increased TNF-a was measured after treatment (P 5 0.08; Fig. 4D); no trend, however, was observed for the other cytokines. There was no
relation between the change in the TNF-a level and the
time on study.
DISCUSSION
Cell death signaling is a complex process commonly dysregulated in malignancy. The current study tested the
ability of the SMAC mimetic birinapant to release a block
to apoptosis in ovarian tumors by downregulating cIAPs
and NF-jB signaling. Detailed pharmacodynamic endpoints were included to better understand in vivo effects
of this drug to leverage this compound optimally in combination therapies in the future. The major limitation of
this study was the small number of enrolled patients,
which was due to the lack of clinical benefit in the first
stage of accrual. Accrual was halted early on ethical
grounds to prevent the subjection of subsequent patients
to the risks of the study (adverse events, tumor biopsy,
and radiation from associated imaging) when there was
no signal of efficacy. Even the small cohort, however, provided valuable information. In line with prior studies, birinapant was well tolerated. Prospectively collected
correlative studies demonstrated good penetration of the
drug into tumors and consistent target downregulation of
the cIAP1 protein in tumors and PBMCs. A study of the
single agent was necessary to confirm drug penetration
into tumors, define the on-target activity of the compound, and provide a better understanding of the relevance of IAPs to chemorefractory ovarian cancer.
Normal cells have redundancy in pathways to maintain plasticity of signaling, but this redundancy is often
breached in the transformation to malignancy when cancer cells develop a addiction to a single signaling node;
this introduces a point for therapeutic intervention. This
did not appear to be the case for cIAP1 in multiple recurrent ovarian cancers. The lack of clinical responses or disease stabilization suggests that downregulation of cIAP1
alone is insufficient to decrease the tumor burden in
women with recurrent ovarian cancer, and IAP1 does not,
in itself, sustain the viability of ovarian cancer cells. Thus,
SMAC mimetics may be better suited for augmenting apoptosis in combination with anticancer agents. Although
a combination of reproducible on-target suppression and
clinical efficacy is the key ingredient for proceeding with
further development of novel targeted agents when they
are intended as single agents, this particular targeted agent
595

Original Article

shows a compelling mechanism of action, and this suggests that it should be logically combined with other
agents to augment their ability to induce programmed cell
death. For example, we measured a significant decrease in
procaspase 3 in tumor biopsy samples, and this suggested
that caspase 3 cleavage had occurred. Trends were also
seen in the suppression of NF-jB activity, the prosurvival
pathway. Thus, birinapant combined with agents that act
on similar signaling nodes could maximize clinical
benefit.
NF-jB activity also affects programmed cell death.
Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a induce prosurvival and antiapoptotic NF-jB signaling, which opposes
TNF-a–induced apoptosis.27 In our current study,
patients showed a trend toward increased levels of circulating TNF-a. A recent trial of Debio 1143 (AT-406) also
reported increased TNF-a levels after study agent administration in 4 of 5 patients.28 Cytokine-induced inflammation may trigger some adverse events associated with
birinapant, a bivalent SMAC mimetic. Both monovalent
and bivalent SMAC mimetics have been developed. Bivalent SMAC mimetics have higher binding affinities that
correspond to higher potency and potentially better efficacy in preclinical models.29,30 Bell’s palsy has been
observed only with bivalent SMAC mimetics.31,32 This
adverse event was reported in 11 of 238 patients (4.6%) in
previous trials with birinapant and in 4 of 54 patients
(7.4%) in a phase 1 trial with HGS1029. In the current
study, the constellation of clinical findings was consistent
with increased cranial nerve inflammation rather than the
immunosuppression typically associated with viral reactivation–associated palsy. In this case of Bell’s palsy, nerve
function returned after brief anti-inflammatory treatment, and the patient received additional birinapant without further complications. We observed no significant
alterations in cytokines in our limited study population,
although individual patients did show elevations in TNF,
TRAIL, IL-6, and IL-8. In this patient, cytokines had
decreased by C2D15 after the treatment and resolution of
the event. Despite the infrequency of Bell’s palsy, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative for minimizing long-term deleterious effects.
Cooperative interactions between chemotherapeutics and SMAC mimetics have been achieved in the preclinical setting at lower concentrations, which should
minimize chemotherapy-related morbidity.33-35 A phase
1b/2a clinical trial established the safety and tolerability of
birinapant combined with 5 different chemotherapy regimens (NCT01188499). Birinapant with docetaxel was
well tolerated and may offer a logical experimental option
596

for women with recurrent ovarian cancer, to whom docetaxel is frequently administered in the third line. The
combination of birinapant with a TRAIL death receptor
agonist is also promising. In the preclinical setting,
TRAIL and TNF-a sensitized head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma cell lines to birinapant treatment, whereas
docetaxel was synergistic with birinapant. The combination of birinapant with TRAIL and docetaxel decreased
cell density in vitro, whereas the combination of birinapant and docetaxel delayed tumor growth to a greater
extent than birinapant monotherapy in xenografts.33 A
phase 1/2 study is currently underway to test the safety
and activity of birinapant combined with the TRAIL agonist antibody conatumumab in women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer (NCT01940172).
Birinapant demonstrated reproducible on-target
suppression but minimal single-agent activity. Correlative
studies included in this clinical trial confirmed the ontarget activity of birinapant and established that IAP is
not a viable target in isolation for ovarian cancer. Rational
combination therapies with SMAC mimetics are likely
required to improve antitumor activity. Because of the
good tolerability of birinapant, the results of our phase 2
clinical trial support moving forward with this promising
agent in combination therapy for cancer treatment.
Future clinical trials with birinapant should incorporate
similar markers of activity and search for predictive
markers of response to combination therapy. Innovative
research incorporating high-throughput drug screening
will help to identify clinically relevant synergistic drug
combinations with birinapant to exploit apoptotic signaling for treating ovarian cancer.
