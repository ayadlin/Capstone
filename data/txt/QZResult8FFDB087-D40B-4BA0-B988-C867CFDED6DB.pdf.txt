ABSTRACT
Lung cancer, as well as lung metastases from distal primary tumors, could benefit
from aerosol treatment. Unfortunately, because of lung physiology, clearance of
nebulized drugs is fast, paralleled by unwanted systemic exposure. Here we report
that nebulized AvidinOX can act as an artificial receptor for biotinylated drugs. In nude
and SCID mice with advanced human KRAS-mutated A549 metastatic lung cancer,
pre-nebulization with AvidinOX enables biotinylated Cetuximab to control tumor
growth at a dose lower than 1/25,000 the intravenous effective dose. This result
correlates with a striking, specific and unpredictable effect of AvidinOX-anchored
biotinylated Cetuximab, as well as Panitumumab, observed on a panel of tumor cell
lines, leading to inhibition of dimerization and signalling, blockade of endocytosis,
induction of massive lysosomal degradation and abrogation of nuclear translocation
of EGFR. Excellent tolerability, together with availability of pharmaceutical-grade
AvidinOX and antibodies, will allow rapid clinical translation of the proposed therapy.

INTRODUCTION

[5], gene therapy [6] and Cetuximab [7] showed, in
principle, feasibility and utility of such approach.
Unfortunately, lung’s physiology is well adapted to clear
inhaled exogenous substances. Therefore, there is a need
to identify new technologies improving lung residency of
nebulized therapeutics.
We recently reported that injected AvidinOX
exhibits the distinctive property to form Schiff’s bases
with tissue proteins thus constituting a stable receptor
for biotinylated therapeutics [8-12]. This product is
currently investigated in phase I clinical trial for targeting
177
Lutetium-biotinDOTA (177Lu-ST2210) [13] to inoperable
liver metastases (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02053324).
Presently, we show that aerosol treatment with AvidinOX,
followed by a very low dose of biotinylated Cetuximab
(bCet) is effective in inhibiting tumor growth, in severe
metastatic lung cancer models. This result correlates
with an unpredictable improvement of in vitro anti-tumor

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths and it has the greatest overall economic burden
among all cancers [1]. Many patients are diagnosed
with locally advanced disease and receive platinumbased therapies whose efficacy and tolerability are not
satisfactory. Lung cancer cells express ErbB receptors and
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal
antibodies (Mab) such as Cetuximab, Panitumumab and
Necitumumab have been widely used in clinical trials by
intravenous administration, showing limited efficacy and
poor tolerability [2-4].
Aerosol may be an appealing delivery route for lung
cancer therapy because of site specificity, low drug doses
and excellent patient’s compliance. Several pre-clinical
and clinical studies with nebulized chemotherapeutics

their biotinylated version, the antibodies are anchored
to AvidinOX on the surface of tumor cells. Importantly,

transportation into the blood stream. Immunoglobulins,
including Cetuximab, are translocated into the blood by
neonatal FcR (FcRn)-mediated transcytosis [14, 15]. We
hypothesized that entrapment of anti-EGFR Mabs within
the lung might be useful for treating tumors nesting in the
lung and we thought to deliver by aerosol biotinylated
Cetuximab (bCet) after AvidinOX. Linkage of nebulized
AvidinOX to the lung needed to be demonstrated having
previously employed it by intra-tissue injection, only.
Therefore, we exposed mice to nebulized AvidinOX and
found, after 24 h, avidin immunostaining up to terminal
bronchiole (Fig. 1A). An AvidinOX dose-escalating study
demonstrated uptake of intravenous radioactive biotin

(111In-ST2210) in the lung, reaching plateau after 40 minute
exposure (Supplementary Table S1A). Subsequently, we
confirmed that mice, nebulized 40 minutes with AvidinOX,
exhibit specific uptake of intravenous 111In-ST2210 in the
lung and that radioactivity persists at least 24 hours (Fig.
1B). Representative µPET image of mice nebulized with
AvidinOX showing distribution of intravenously injected

Cu-ST2210 in the whole lungs in Supplementary Figure
S1. Overall data indicate that nebulized AvidinOX links
to the lung and it can be used for delivering biotinylated
drugs. Radionuclide therapy of lung cancer is deemed
impracticable because of the high sensitivity of normal
lung to irradiation. Therefore, we decided to investigate
the use of AvidinOX for targeting biotinylated Cetuximab,
relaying on higher toxicity of the antibody towards tumor
compared to normal cells.
To test the effect of AvidinOX anchorage on
Cetuximab activity, the antibody was biotinylated
according to previous methods [16]. Panitumumab
(human IgG2 anti-EGFR) and Rituximab (chimeric IgG1
anti-CD20 Mab) were also biotinylated representing
a second EGFR-specific and a negative control Mab,
respectively. Similarity of biotinylated Mabs with their
original version was confirmed and purity and potency
specifications were set to maximize consistency among
batches (Supplementary Table S1B). In vitro binding
and anti-tumor activity of free and AvidinOX-anchored
biotinylated antibodies were evaluated on a panel of
tumor cell lines of different origin and exhibiting different
EGFR expression (high A431, medium H1299, low A549
or none SKMel28) and oncogenic pathways. Tumor cell
characteristics in Supplementary Table S1C. AvidinOX
conjugation to tumor cells, performed as previously
described [17], did not affect the binding properties of
Cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S2A) or Panitumumab
(data not shown), as measured by cytofluorimetry.
Binding of bCet and biotinylated Panitumumab (bPan)
to tumor cells, correlated with the number of cell surface
EGFR molecules and biotinylated Rituximab (bRit) did
not bind. All biotinylated antibodies bound AvidinOXconjugated cells independently on the presence of their
specific antigen, as expected. Binding of bCet and bPan to
EGFR expressing cells appeared to be slightly increased
on AvidinOX-conjugated cells compared to unconjugated,
possibly as a result of antigen and AvidinOX binding
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Quantitative evaluation of
bCet and bPan binding to A431, A549 and SKMel28
cells, pre-conjugated with 10 or 100 µg/mL AvidinOX,
confirmed previous cytofluorimetry data and pointed out
a pro-zone effect at antibody concentrations higher than
25 µg/mL on cells conjugated with the higher AvidinOX
concentration. This effect is independent on antibody
specificity (bRit) or antigen expression (SKMel28) thus
likely attributable to a competitive binding of biotinylated
antibodies to AvidinOX (Fig. 1C). The fate of AvidinOXanchored antibodies was investigated by High Content
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Screening (HCS) fluorescence imaging. Fluorescent bCet
and bPan but not fluorescent bRit were found within the
cytoplasm of A431 and A549 but not SKMel28 cells
after 30 minute incubation, as expected. On AvidinOXconjugated cells, fluorescence was observed on the
membrane of all cells and interestingly, in this condition,
internalization of biotinylated anti-EGFR antibodies was
prevented (Fig. 1D). Internalization of EGFR/ligand (EGF
or anti-EGFR antibodies) complex is a physiological
mechanism affecting the tumor cell response to growth
and inhibition stimuli. We then addressed the effect of
Cetuximab anchorage on tumor cell proliferation.
It was previously demonstrated that proliferation of
PC3 (prostate carcinoma), 3T3 and mouse spleen cells is
not affected by AvidinOX conjugation [17]. This result
was also preliminarily confirmed with A431, A549, H1299
and SKMel28 cells (data not shown). On the other hand,
biological activity of AvidinOX-anchored bCet and bPan
needed to be confirmed. Unexpectedly, higher proliferation
inhibition of A431, A549 and H1299 (EGFR+ ) but not
SKMel28 (EGFR-) cells was induced by AvidinOXanchored bCet or bPan compared to Cet or Pan, even
after only 15 minute contact, as to simulate a transient
exposure to drugs like in aerosol treatment (Fig. 2A-E).
Interestingly, lower inhibitory activity was occasionally
observed at the highest antibody concentration reminding
of the pro-zone effect previously seen in binding
experiments (Fig. 1C). It is to note that inhibition of A549
by Cetuximab and Panitumumab was only obtained with
concentrations higher than 200 µg/mL where Rituximab
also occasionally inhibited (data not shown). On the
contrary, on AvidinOX-conjugated cells, bCet and bPan
were active at doses below 2 µg/mL. Clonogenic assay
showed significant difference in the size but not number
of A549 or A431 cell clones with AvidinOX-anchored
bCet compared to Cet (Fig. 2F-H). Inhibition of EGFR+
tumor cell growth by AvidinOX-anchored anti-EGFR
antibodies correlated with increased induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 3A-C). Proliferation and apoptosis experiments were
performed with 10 and 100 µg/mL AvidinOX conjugation
and most reproducible data, here shown, were obtained
with the higher AvidinOX concentration.
It is known that antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC) contributes to the overall clinical efficacy of
Cetuximab [18]. Therefore, we deemed necessary to test
the effect of AvidinOX anchorage on Cetuximab-mediated
ADCC. Results showed that ADCC activity of human
primary NK cells against A549, is comparable if mediated
by Cet or AvidinOX-anchored bCet (Fig. 3D). Rituximab,
Panitumumab and their biotinylated derivatives were
negative in all conditions (Fig. 3E). These data indicate
that AvidinOX anchorage does not impair Cetuximab
ADCC and it does not activate antigen- (Rituximab) or
isotype- (Panitumumab) independent ADCC.

receptor homo- hetero-dimerization [19] followed by

endocytosis of EGFR/ligand (or antibody) complex
and signaling [20, 21]. Our data indicate that bMab
internalization is prevented by AvidinOX (Fig. 1D).
Interference of AvidinOX conjugation with EGFR
endocytosis was preliminarily ruled out in EGFstimulated A431, A549 and H1299 cells by fluorescence
imaging (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The possibility that
AvidinOX-mediated entrapment of anti-EGFR bMabs on
the cell membrane, might interfere with EGFR trafficking
was then addressed. Without AvidinOX, EGFR rapidly
co-localized with bCet within the cytoplasm of A549
cells while with AvidinOX, bCet remained co-localized
with EGFR on the cell membrane and the intracellular
EGFR appeared to be significantly reduced after 2 hours
(Fig. 4A). This effect was proved specific as it was not
observed with AvidinOX-anchored bRit (Supplementary
Fig. S3B) while it was similar with bPan on A431, A549
and H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Reduction
of intracellular EGFR in A549 cells was evident after 30
minute antibody contact and almost complete at 24 hours
(Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained with H1299 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Disappearance of intracellular
EGFR in A549 cells in the presence of AvidinOXanchored bCet correlated with co-localization of EGFR
within lysosomes indicating massive receptor degradation
(Fig. 4C). A large size representative image of EGFR
and lysosome co-localization in Supplementary Figure
S3E. bPan but not bRit induced the same co-localization
effect (Supplementary Fig. S3F). Fluorescence imaging
data indicate that AvidinOX anchorage of anti-EGFR
antibodies prevents their internalization as well as
endocytosis of EGFR. This sort of “receptor paralysis” is
associated to massive translocation of intracellular EGFR
in the lysosomes resulting in massive degradation. To
investigate this peculiar phenomenon at molecular level,
we performed western blot experiments.
It is known that EGFR dimers initiate downstream
signaling [22]. Interestingly, we found that EGFR homo
and heterodimerization but not ErbB2 homodimerization
were specifically inhibited by AvidinOX-anchored bCet
(Fig. 5A). EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR,
STAT3, AKT and ERK in A431 and A549 cells was not
affected by AvidinOX conjugation and it was similarly
inhibited by Cet and bCet in the absence of AvidinOX
while, in AvidinOX-conjugated cells, phosphorylation
of EGFR was abrogated by bCet (Fig. 5B). Upon this
condition, phosphorylation of downstream signalling
elements was also strongly reduced, with the exception of
pSTAT3 in A549 cells, consistently with the presence of
constitutively activated JAK2-mediated STAT3 pathway
[23]. Dramatic inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was
observed in AvidinOX-conjugated A549 (Fig. 5C) and
H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4) upon 15 minute
contact with bCet or bPan but not bRit paralleled by an
equally dramatic decrease in the level of total EGFR.
A novel nuclear mode of EGFR signalling has been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recently described in which EGFR is shuttled from the
cell surface to the nucleus after endocytosis and there it
acts as a transcriptional regulator inducing proliferation,
DNA repair, replication and chemo-, radio-resistance
[24, 25]. Cet and bCet caused a similar slight reduction
of nuclear EGFR in A431 but not A549 cells while, in
both AvidinOX-conjugated cells, bCet caused almost
complete EGFR disappearance (Fig. 5D). Reduction of
phosphorylated and total EGFR in both nuclear and nonnuclear compartments of EGF-induced A549 cells, after 15
minute contact with bCet or bPan in Figure 5E. Abrogation
of nuclear EGFR by bCet or bPan at a concentration as
low as 0.6 µg/mL, was confirmed by ELISA in AvidinOXconjugated A549 and H1299 cells (Fig. 5F). These data,
together with previous fluorescence imaging data (Fig.
4A-C and Supplementary S3B-F), indicate that AvidinOXanchored anti-EGFR antibodies inhibit dimerization,
endocytosis and promote massive degradation of EGFR
thus preventing nuclear translocation.
In vitro data pointed to an unpredictable potentiation
of Cetuximab and Panitumumab anti-tumor activity
upon AvidinOX anchorage, thus supporting their use,
in combination with AvidinOX, for aerosol therapy
of tumors nesting in the lung. Integrity of nebulized
AvidinOX, bCet and bPan was preliminarily confirmed
by chromatography (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In a
previous study with Cetuximab-sensitive A431 cells
(intra-tracheal transplantation), 2 mg/mouse Cetuximab,
sprayed weekly into upper respiratory tract, induced
reduction of tumor nodule size [7]. To test our therapy,
we established a more challenging model of metastatic
lung cancer by intravenously injecting KRAS mutated,
Cetuximab-resistant A549 cells. Lung histopathology
from A549-transplanted and AvidinOX-nebulized mice,
confirmed solid tumor growth and avidin immunostaining
(Fig. 6A). In a first study, mice were treated by nose-only
aerosol starting two weeks after A549 transplantation, for
4 consecutive weeks, with an estimated lung delivered
dose of 36 µg/mouse bCet , with and without prior 72
µg/mouse AvidinOX nebulization. One group received
0.36 µg/mouse bCet after AvidinOX. Details on aerosol
equipment and dose calculation [26] in Supplementary
Figure S5B. Unexpectedly, a delay of 28 days on the
onset of mortality was observed in the group treated
with AvidinOX and 0.36 µg/mouse bCet compared to all
other groups (Fig. 6B). A second study confirmed that
0.36 µg bCet was only effective in mice pre-treated with
AvidinOX (Fig. 6C). In a third study, bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) of nude mice transplanted with A549luc
cells showed that mice treated by intravenous Cetuximab
(1 mg/mouse) or by aerosol with AvidinOX and bCet (0.36
µg/mouse) exhibited significant reduced light signal in the
lung compared to AvidinOX-treated mice (Fig. 6D). After
discontinuation of treatment, light emission increased in
mice treated with nebulized AvidinOX or with intravenous
Cetuximab while the signal remained low in mice treated

with nebulized AvidinOX and bCet up to day 57 (Fig. 6E).
A fourth study with A549luc cells was performed in SCID/
beige mice that are defective of NK activity thus being
possibly cured by anti-EGFR inhibition only. Differently
from nude mice, BLI pictures of SCID mice showed
extensive whole body tumor growth with stronger light
signals in head than in lung. Systemic tumor burden was
significantly reduced by the treatment with intravenous
Cetuximab and, unexpectedly, by aerosol with AvidinOX
and 0.36 µg/mouse bCet (Fig. 6F). Quantitative evaluation
of the lung’s light emission confirmed significant lower
signal in mice treated by 4 weekly intravenous injections
of 1 mg Cetuximab and in those treated by aerosol with
AvidinOX and 0.36 but not 3.6 µg/mouse bCet, compared
to controls (Fig. 6G). An additional study was performed
in SCID mice by using, for aerosol treatment, a standard
household nebulization equipment and delivering, with
and without previous AvidinOX, 3.5 mL bCet at 100, 30,
10 and 3 µg/mL, corresponding to 0.4, 0.12, 0,04, 0.012
µg/mouse, respectively. Details on aerosol equipment and
dose calculation in Supplementary Figure S5C. BLI, one
day after 8 weekly aerosol treatments, strikingly confirmed
elimination of whole body light signals in mice treated
with AvidinOX followed by a dose as low as 0.04 µg/
mouse bCet (Fig. 6H). Average photon data indicated
significant anti-tumor efficacy of the treatment during
the study and persisting up to one week after treatment
discontinuation (Fig. 6I). Similar anti-tumor efficacy was
observed with 0.12 µg/mouse while 0.012 and 0.4 µg/
mouse showed lower or none activity (Supplementary Fig.
S5D). Consistently with BLI data, the ratio of lung/body
weight was significantly lower in the group treated with
0.04 µg/mouse (Fig. 6L) in agreement with the effect of
treatment on lung tumor burden. Finally, confirmation of
the strikingly anti-tumor efficacy of the aerosol treatment
with AvidinOX and bCet 0.04 µg/mouse, was obtained
by histology showing in this group of mice, one week
after the last treatment, an almost normal lung tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S5E).
Pre-clinical development of biopharmaceuticals
is more challenging for inhaled compared to parenteral
forms because it requires studies addressing both local
and systemic toxicities. Particularly, being AvidinOX a
xenogenic protein, studies in immunocompetent animals
were performed to address immune-related risks. Mice,
subjected to six weekly nose-only aerosol treatments with
AvidinOX, with and without subsequent biotinylated
mouse IgG (bIgG), showed neither clinical signs nor body
or lung weight changes (data not shown). Consistently,
neither inflammatory signs were found by lung histology
despite prominent AvidinOX immunostaining (Fig.
7A) nor difference in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
inflammatory cytokines were observed (Fig. 7B).
Significantly higher mouse anti-AvidinOX antibody
(MAVA) titers were detected in mice exposed to AvidinOX
compared to vehicle or bIgG (Fig. 7C). A second study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was performed by whole body aerosol exposure. Mice
were treated once a week for 6 consecutive weeks with
nebulized AvidinOX with and without subsequent
nebulized bIgG or bCet. Neither clinical signs nor
changes in body or lung weight were recorded and lung
histology and BAL cytokine analyses confirmed lack
of inflammation (data not shown). Consistently with
previous nose-only data, higher MAVA titers were found
in mice treated with AvidinOX compared to vehicle,
bIgG or bCet (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, MAVA titers were
significantly higher in mice that had received bIgG or
bCet after AvidinOX thus suggesting a possible adjuvant
role of immunoglobulins in AvidinOX immunogenicity.
Neither anti-IgG nor anti-Cetuximab antibody response
was detectable (data not shown). IgA were detectable
in serum but not in BAL of two high responder mice.
Average MAVA titers, induced by repeated aerosol
exposure to AvidinOX, appear to be lower than mouse,
rat and cynomolgus titers after single or repeated i.m.
or intra-hepatic injections (Supplementary Fig. S5F).
Local tolerability and systemic exposure of intra-tracheal
nebulized AvidinOX, bCet and AvidinOX followed
by bCet, were then evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys
(Macaca fascicularis), which is a relevant species
for Cetuximab specificity [27]. No clinical signs nor
changes in behavior were observed in the 48 hours after
treatment. Mild inflammatory signs with minor difference
among groups were found in the lung by histology (Fig.
7E). AvidinOX showed a blood peak in all monkeys, 4
hours after nebulization (Fig. 7F). bCet peaked after 12
or 24 hours only in animals not previously treated with
AvidinOX (Fig. 7G) confirming that systemic exposure to
nebulized bCet is prevented by entrapment of biotinylated
antibody in lung-bound AvidinOX.

DISCUSSION
Aerosol treatment of lung cancer has a strong
rationale as a standalone therapy for patients with
inoperable, locally advanced disease and as adjuvant
to chemotherapy for patients with metastases out of the
lung. Aerosol is an attractive option because patient’s
compliance is high, it can be performed in an outpatient
setting, dose of drugs is lower compared to systemic
delivery with consequent reduction of systemic side
effects and costs. Here we show, in mice pre-nebulized
with AvidinOX, anti-tumor efficacy of nebulized bCet.
The concentration of nebulized bCet solution appears to
be critical. In fact, the lung delivered dose of 0.36 µg/
mouse, delivered nebulizing 30 µg/mL solution in the
first four efficacy studies was consistently active, whereas
the doses of 36 and 0.4 µg/mouse, delivered nebulizing
3 mg/mL and 100 µg/mL solution in the first and fifth
study, respectively, were not active. The dose of 0.04
µg/mouse, delivered nebulizing 10 µg/mL solution, was
also active, representing the lowest effective dose in the

present animal model, as the dose of 0.012 µg/mouse
(3 µg/mL solution) was not sufficient. Overall in vivo
anti-tumor results, in agreement with previous in vitro
data, suggest that a pro-zone effect in AvidinOX binding
might occur at high nebulized bCet concentrations and
indicate that the effective lung delivered dose of bCet
can be as low as 0.04 µg/mouse, when administered
after AvidinOX nebulization. This dose is 1/50.000 of
Cetuximab nebulized effective dose previously reported
[7] and 1/25,000 the effective 1 mg/mouse intravenous
dose that, in turn, corresponds to the 250 mg/m2 weekly
maintenance dose administered to lung cancer patients for
16-18 weeks in clinical trials. In USA, 18 week Cetuximab
treatment costs an average of 80,000$ [28] and the clinical
trials, in combination with chemotherapy, were rather
disappointing thus casting doubts on the appropriateness
of further investigation [4, 29]. A phase 2 trial of
Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy did not
improve the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients [30].
Necitumumab, added to chemotherapy, was reported to
improve of 1.6 month the overall survival of lung cancer
patients (SQUIRE study) and FDA approval is pending
(Eli Lilly web site). The cost of Necitumumab is expected
to be similar to that of Cetuximab consequently, its clinical
applicability is expected to be similarly affected by cost/
utility evaluations. No doubts there is still a high medical
need for more effective and economically affordable lung
cancer therapies. Here we show that aerosol treatment
with a very low dose bCet, nebulized after AvidinOX,
can control tumor growth within and outside the lung.
The most plausible explanation of this unexpected result,
derives from increasing awareness of the ability of tumor
cells to mediate long-range stimulation of metastatic
growth, by releasing systemically microvesicles loaded
with epigenetic information [31]. Further studies will be
performed to address this issue and better evaluate the
consequence of lung cancer inhibition by our aerosol
approach, on distal metastases.
Immunocompetent animals show excellent
tolerability to repeated AvidinOX exposure, despite the
induction of an antibody response, that is expected against
a xenogenic protein. In this respect, we previously argued
that anti-avidin antibodies do not hamper the human
clinical use of Avidin or AvidinOX [17, 32].
Present in vitro data point to a new, unpredictable
effect on tumor cells of AvidinOX-anchored bCet and
bPan that, despite engaging two distinct receptor epitopes
[33], both prevent homo and heterodimerization and
induce massive lysosomal degradation of EGFR. This
result is of particular relevance as there is a growing
appreciation of the role of spatial regulation of receptors
tyrosine kinase (RTKs) in cancer [34]. Several data
indicate that the translocation of cell surface receptors
of the EGFR family (EGFR, EGFRvIII, ErbB-2, ErbB3 and ErbB-4) as well as other receptors (i.e. fibroblast
growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, cMET), from
the cell membrane to the nucleus is involved in stimulation
of cell proliferation, tumor progression, DNA repair and
chemo-radio-resistance [25, 35, 36]. Cetuximab-induced
nuclear localization of EGFR has been reported [20]
and poor response to Cetuximab was observed in lung
cancer and other solid tumors correlating with EGFR
nuclear localization [35, 37, 38] thus making nuclear
EGFR an important molecular target in cancer [39].
Consequently, many groups are trying to inhibit EGFR
internalization and nuclear localization. It is known
that EGFR internalizes via dynamin- and Syntaxin 6dependent processes [40, 41] and trafficks within vesicles
to subcellular compartments including lysosomes where
it is degraded, endoplasmic reticulum where it is recycled
back to the cell surface, and nucleus where it sustains
pro-tumorigenic signalling, through pathways mutual to
ErbB2 [42]. A recent work in A431 cells, where EGFR
internalization was impaired by inhibiting dynamin with
a small molecule or with siRNA, showed reduction
of EGF-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation but not of
EGFR or Erk1/2 phosphorylation [43]. Another study
in dynamin-depleted murine fibroblasts also showed
impairment of EGFR endocytosis but, in contrast with
A431 results, a strong enhancement of phosphorylation
of the membrane-bound EGFR was observed, paired by
unaffected MAPK and increased AKT activation [40].
Phosphorylation of ERK was also previously described
in HeLa cells in which EGFR endocytosis was impaired
by siRNA silencing clathrin [44]. The overall balance
of EGFR trafficking towards degradation or signalling
very much affects the response of tumor cells to EGFR
inhibitors. Here we clearly show that engagement of
EGFR by AvidinOX-anchored biotinylated Cetuximab or
Panitumumab prevents dimerization, induces inhibition
of phosphorylation and promotes massive degradation of
the receptor. Our strategy is more effective in silencing
EGFR pathway than inhibiting EGFR endocytosis by any
means. Overall picture is schematically represented in
Supplementary Figure S6.
Our data provide a proof of concept on utility of
an innovative therapeutic platform based on nebulized
AvidinOX enabling a smarter use of well-known antibodies
like Cetuximab. The choice of a full length antibody,
instead of an antibody fragment, was deemed necessary to
preserve the ADCC property of Cetuximab. Nevertheless,
in future studies, we will address the possibility to use
biotinylated antibody fragments, like Fabs or single
chain Fvs, which might be more convenient than full size
immunoglobulins for pharmacokinetics and production
costs. Our approach, that proved to be well tolerated, is
broadly useful and highly appealing because: first it will
make possible to simultaneously block internalization of
multiple tumorigenic receptors (i.e. EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3
and cMet) that are all of therapeutic value in lung cancer
[45, 46], thus representing a precious tool to counteract
9250

tumor resistance to single agent therapies; second, it will
allow the delivery of diverse, multiple, patient-tailored,
biotinylated therapeutics, possibly combining anti-tumor
drugs with immune-stimulating reagents like IL2 [47]
or anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1 antibodies [48] thus offering
a unique opportunity for an integrated fight against lung
cancer, with or without concurrent chemotherapy. In this
respect, here we show that AvidinOX anchoring does not
interfere with Cetuximab capability to induce ADCC;
third, much better tolerability is expected compared to
intravenous antibody treatments due to low doses and no
systemic exposure; fourth, applicability could be easily
extended to lung metastases from any cancer for which
therapeutic antibodies are available; last but not least,
AvidinOX is not expensive and the amount of expensive
antibodies is expected to be so low that the therapy will
be certainly affordable for any patient. A pre-clinical
regulatory program is ongoing for rapidly moving the
proposed aerosol therapy into clinical development.

cell lysate was prepared by incubation, 10 min on ice,
with 1X Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were
subjected to sonication prior to centrifugation at 14,000
x g, for 10 min at 4°C, to remove cell debris. To extract
the cytoplasmic/membrane protein fraction, the cells
were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in lowsalt buffer (20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA)
with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT and protease and
phosphatase inhibitors and were allowed to swell on ice
20 min. The cell suspension was then transferred into a
syringe and slowly passed 3 times through a 28-gauge
needle, and subsequently subjected to sonication 10 sec
on ice, followed by centrifugation 10 min at 4°C. The
supernatant [cytosol/membrane fraction] was collected
and stored at -80°C. The nuclear pellet was washed 3
times with cold low-salt buffer and resuspended in highsalt lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 420 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol) with DTT and
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Nuclear protein
extraction was achieved by passing the solution through
a syringe with a 28-gauge needle, and then incubating 30
min on ice before proceeding with the final sonication and
centrifugation steps as above. The supernatant was snapfrozen into aliquots and stored at -80°C. Protein content
was determined by Bradford method. Equal amounts
of soluble proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham
Hybond-ECL; GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked
3 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS
0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) before overnight incubation,
at 4°C, with one of the following primary antibodies:
pEGFR (#2236), EGFR (#4267), pAKT (#4058), AKT
(#9272), pERK 1/2 (#9101) and ERK 1/2 (#9102) from
Cell Signaling; pSTAT3 (#sc-81523) and STAT3 (#sc7179) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoblotting
with anti-α-tubulin (#T5168; Sigma Aldrich) or antiHDAC2 (#2540; Cell Signaling) antibodies was done to
confirm equal protein loading for non-nuclear and nuclear
protein extracts, respectively. After washings with PBS-T,
membranes were incubated 1 h with the appropriate
secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:3,000) or
anti-mouse (1:2,000) IgG antibody (Sigma Aldrich and
Amersham GE-Healthcare, respectively). Immunoreactive
bands were visualized after enhanced chemiluminescence
detection (Amersham ECL plus; GE-Healthcare) and
analyzed by phosphoimaging (STORM, Molecular
Dynamics) or by exposure to X-ray film (Amersham
Hyperfilm ECL; GE-Healthcare).

METHODS
HCS Fluorescence Imaging
Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (36x103/well) and cultivated 3 days, starved for additional
24 h in serum-free medium and then, with or without
AvidinOX conjugation (100 µg/mL), incubated with 5
µg/mL CF488-labelled antibodies in DMEM, for 30 min.
Antibodies were removed by washing with medium and
cells analysed for fluorescence by High Content Screening
(HCS) system Operetta (Perkin Elmer), immediately, or
after 24 h cultivation in medium 10% FBS. Detection of
lysosomes by LysoTracker (Life Technologies) added the
last 30 min of culture. EGFR was detected by AF555conjugated rabbit anti-EGFR (D38B1) (Cell Signaling),
added after cell fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS, permeabilization with PBS 0.2%Tween-20
(PBS-T) and blocking with 2% BSA in PBS-T. Cells were
counterstained with Draq5 or Hoechst33342 dyes (Cell
Signaling).

Western blot analysis
A431, A549 or H1299 cells were seeded in 10-cm
culture plates (1.2x106 cells/plate) in DMEM 10% FBS,
and then starved additional 24 h in serum-free medium.
Cells, with and without AvidinOX conjugation (100 µg/
mL), were then cultivated 18 h with MAbs or bMAbs at
different concentrations in DMEM. In some experiments,
antibodies were removed after initial 15 min contact.
EGFR activation was performed by adding 100 ng/mL
EGF (R&D) 30 min before cell lysis. At the end of culture,
cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then whole

and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer [20 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5
mM EDTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors], after 5
min or 18 h cultivation in serum-free medium. Aliquots of
cell lysates were stimulated or not with 1 µg/mL EGF, 30
min at room temperature. Then receptor cross-linking was
induced by incubating 2 min with 40 mM glutaraldehyde
and reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2 M glycine
(pH 9.0). Protein samples were finally assessed by Western
Blot with the following primary antibodies: EGFR (#05104) from Upstate, and ErbB2 (Neu A-2; #sc-393712)
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

mg/mL solution), with or without subsequent 3.5 mL of
30 µg/mL murine biotinylated IgG or bCet nebulization,
four hours later. Treatment was performed once a week
for 6-8 consecutive weeks. One and 7 days after the last
nebulization, mice were sacrificed and blood collected
for mouse IgG and IgA anti-AvidinOX antibody (MAVA)
titration. Lungs were explanted, bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) collected and used for multi-cytokine detection
(SearchLight multiplex immunoassay kit). Lung samples
were fixed in formalin for histology evaluation. MAVA
titration was performed by ELISA as previously described
[17] on AvidinOX-coated plates using an AP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG or a HRP-conjugated rat antimouse IgA (Sigma Aldrich). The titer was expressed as
log2 dilution giving OD=0.5. Confirmatory assay was
performed in positive samples by adding an excess of
free avidin. AvidinOX and bCet were administered to
Cynomolgus monkey by intratracheal laryngoscopeguided nebulization. Three groups of two young females
of 3.5-4.8 kg were treated, under general anaesthesia,
with 3.0 mg/kg AvidinOX, 12.6 mg/animal bCet or
AvidinOX followed by b-Cet at the same doses, 15 min
apart. Nebulization was performed by AeroProbe (Trudell
Medical International). The animals were continuously
observed for behavioural changes (i.e. food consumption)
and clinical signs. To evaluate the systemic exposure
to AvidinOX or bCet, blood samples were collected
before and at different time points after nebulization and
sera tested by specific ELISA. Forty height hours after
treatment animals were euthanized by sodium thiopental
for body and organ weight, necropsy, lung histology and
immunohistochemistry analyses. The study was conducted
at Accelera (Milan, Italy). Immunohistochemistry was
performed on paraffin embedded sections both for mice
and cynomolgus studies. For avidin and Cetuximab
staining, rabbit anti-avidin polyclonal antibody (Abnova)
and rabbit anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody (Thermo
Scientific) were used at 1:1,000 and 1:500 working
dilutions, respectively, followed by the ImmPress antirabbit detection complex (Vector). Negative controls
consisted in the omission of primary antibody and
untreated animals.

Nuclear EGFR ELISA
AvidinOX-conjugated (100 µg/mL) A549 and
H1299 cells were treated 15 min with Mabs or bMabs at
different concentrations and then cultivated 18 h in fresh
medium, with or without EGF (100 ng/mL) induction
the last 30 min. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared
as described above and EGFR content assessed by the
PathScan Total EGF Receptor Sandwich ELISA kit (Cell
Signaling), according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Animal studies
All studies were conducted in accordance with
European Directive 86/609, Italian Legislation D.L. 116,
Art. 6 1992 and ARRIVE guidelines [50].

A549 orthotopic tumor model and efficacy studies
Metastatic lung cancer was established by injecting
6x106 A549 or A549-luc-C8 (A549luc) cells into the
tail vein of athymic nude or SCID/beige mice. After 1-3
weeks the mice were randomized in groups of 12 and
treated by nose-only (Inexpose System, Scireq-EMKA
Technologies) or whole body (AirFamily system, Pic
indolor) aerosol with AvidinOX (6.5 mL of 3 mg/mL
solution) followed, after 4 h, by nebulized PBS (antibody
vehicle) or bCet. Treatments were repeated for 4-8
consecutive weeks and death events recorded. Control
groups were i.v. administered 1 mg/mouse Cetuximab.
Tumor bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was recorded at
different time points by Xenogen IVIS Imaging System
200 (Perkin Elmer), 15 min after i.p. injection of luciferin
(150 µg/mouse). Details on nose-only and whole body
equipment and dose calculation in Supplementary Figure
S5B,C.

Statistical evaluations
Independent two-sample t-test was used for
comparing experimental versus control groups, according
to sample size and variance. Statistical analysis of multiple
groups’ comparison (more than three groups within a
single experiment or two groups in repeated experiments)
was performed using ANOVA. A significance threshold of
p≤0.05 was assumed. In all figures, values were expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation or standard error.
Survival analyses were carried out by the Kaplan-Meier
method and survival time differences were assessed using
log-rank analysis. All analyses were accomplished using

Tolerability and immunogenicity
