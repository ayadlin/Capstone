BACKGROUND: The objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of incorporating
cetuximab and simultaneous integrated-boost (SIB), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) into a well
described 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and hydroxyurea (HU)-based chemoradiation regimen. METHOD: Patients with stage
IVA and IVB or high-risk stage III squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck were enrolled on a phase 2 trial.
Prior organ-conserving surgery or induction chemotherapy was allowed off protocol. SIB-IMRT was prescribed to
low-risk volumes (43.2 gray [Gy] to 48 Gy) and intermediate-risk volumes (54-63 Gy). A separate IMRT cone-down
plan was targeted to macroscopic disease (72 Gy). The median radiation dose was 72 Gy (range, 60-72 Gy) administered in 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily during Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Concurrent systemic therapy consisted of 5-FU
(600 mg/m2), HU (500 mg twice daily), and cetuximab (250 mg/m2). RESULTS: From January 2007 through April
2008, 33 patients were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year rates of locoregional control, distant
control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 83%, 79%, 69%, and 86%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicity consisted of mucositis in 33% of patients, radiation dermatitis in 15%of patients, anemia in 18% of patients, leukopenia in
18% of patients, neutropenia in 12% of patients, and thrombocytopenia in 3% of patients. Most patients (64%) were
able to tolerate treatment without a feeding tube, and there were no acute or late grade 4 adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that concurrent 5-FU, HU, and cetuximab plus SIB-IMRT is a promising
and reasonably well tolerated approach to incorporating molecularly targeted therapy into curative therapy for

For patients with locally advanced stage (stages III, IVA, and IVB) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),

the traditional approach of radical surgery and radiation therapy has resulted in disappointing cure rates of 30% to 50%.1
In addition, this approach is often is associated with significant cosmetic and functional impairment, resulting in
decreased quality of life.2 Current ongoing, active research is exploring combined-modality therapy to improve survival,
organ preservation, and function in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.3,4 It has been demonstrated that chemoradiation is superior to radiation alone for patients with stage IVA and IV HNSCC and selected patients with stage III HNSCC
in the organ-preservation, inoperable and adjuvant settings.5-8 Concurrent cisplatin and daily radiotherapy is the most
widely investigated treatment regimen, but the results remain suboptimal for some patient subgroups.5,7-9 For instance, in
the most recent US Intergroup study of unresectable stage III and IV disease, patients who received 70 grays (Gy) of radiation in 2-Gy fractions with concurrent cisplatin had a 3-year overall survival rate of 37% and a 3-year disease-specific
survival rate of 51%.5 Patients who had stage III and IV HNSCC who received concurrent cetuximab and radiotherapy
had a 3-year overall survival rate of 55% and a locoregional control rate of 47%.10

Potential avenues of treatment intensification
include incorporating organ-conserving surgery, hyperfractionated radiation, and the use of concurrent multiagent chemotherapy, biologically targeted therapy, or
induction chemotherapy.11-14 Although it is a departure
from conventional chemoradiation paradigms, 1
treatment regimen that incorporates these strategies is the
5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/hydroxyurea-based chemoradiation approach, which was developed by investigators at
the University of Chicago.14,15 Results recently were
reported on the long-term follow-up of multiple phase 2
trials of combined induction carboplatin and paclitaxel
for 6 weeks followed by concurrent 5-FU, hydroxyurea,
and paclitaxel plus twice-daily radiotherapy for patients
with stage IVA and IVB or poor-prognosis stage III head
and neck cancer.14-16 Those results were impressive, with
a 5-year locoregional control rate of 91%, a 5-year distant
control rate of 87%, and a 5-year overall survival rate of
62%.16 Although these results are promising, the regimen
has not been adopted widely because of concerns about
toxicity and complexity. With the objective of reducing
toxicity, a recent phase 2 trial of induction carboplatin
and paclitaxel for 6 weeks followed by concurrent 5-FU,
hydroxyurea, and gefitinib plus twice-daily radiotherapy
resulted in a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 64% and
an overall 3-year survival rate of 73% with decreased hematologic and neurologic toxicity.17 Although cetuximab
had not been combined previously with 5-FU/hydroxyurea-based chemoradiation, extensive preclinical and
clinical data suggest that cetuximab is a well tolerated and
effective radiosensitizer for HNSCC.10,18 Our group
hypothesized that the addition of cetuximab would
enhance the therapeutic ratio of a highly active chemoradiation regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Eligibility
The study opened in January 2007 and reached accrual
goals in April 2008. This phase 2 trial (MSSM 06-1155;
National Clinical Trials no. 00462735) was approved by
the institutional review board. Eligible patients had either
HNSCC or poorly differentiated carcinoma. Patients had
either stage IVA and IVB disease or high-risk stage III disease according to the sixth edition of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual,
which was defined as a base of tongue or hypopharyngeal
primary tumor, or major pathologic risk factors (microscopic positive margins or extracapsular extension). All

cases were reviewed at a multidisciplinary conference,
which was attended by representatives from the Departments of Head and Neck Surgery, Radiation Oncology,
Medical Oncology, Palliative Care, Social Work, and
Nutrition. Patients who had received previous head and
neck radiation were excluded. Patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology performance status 2 and adequate
bone marrow, kidney, and liver function based on laboratory evaluation. Organ-preserving surgery, which was
defined as selective neck dissection or preservation of the
tongue, larynx, and orbit, or induction chemotherapy was
allowed before registration on the protocol.
This phase 2 study was designed as a Fleming 1stage design, with a hypothesized 2-year disease-free survival of 46% for cetuximab and radiation alone and 70%
for concurrent cetuximab, 5-FU, and hydroxyurea plus
hyperfractionated radiotherapy. The targeted accrual was
33 patients (to yield 31 assessable patients), which had an
80% power to reject the null hypothesis with a ¼ .05
using a 2-sided test. Early stopping rules were used in the
event of unexpected grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicities. Of 73
patients who required concurrent radiation and radiosensitizing drug therapy for stage III, IVA, or IVB head and
neck cancer, 40 patients were excluded from the trial (Fig.
1). Reasons for exclusion were patient refusal (n ¼ 18),
previous head and neck radiation (n ¼ 12), stage III
disease that did not meet eligibility criteria (n ¼ 4), and
ineligibility because of a comorbid illness (n ¼ 6).
Initial staging procedures included a history and physical examination, nasolaryngoscopy with biopsy with tumor
measurements, dental evaluation, and head-neck and chest
imaging studies with or without a positron emission tomography (PET) study. When available, PET data were used
for radiation planning using 40% of the maximal standard
uptake value for edge delineation.19 Prophylactic feeding
tubes were strongly recommended for patients with oral
cavity involvement, massive tumors, advanced age, or
limited physiologic reserves. All patients signed a written
informed consent form. Patients were followed prospectively by the multidisciplinary team usually with PET/computed tomography (CT)-based follow-up studies.
Week On/Week Off Chemoradiotherapy
All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy,
which consisted of continuous-infusion 5-FU at a dose of
600 mg/m2 daily for 120 hours, hydroxyurea 500 mg
orally every 12 hours with the morning dose administered
2 hours before radiation, and cetuximab 250 mg/m2 on
Day 1 after the first dose of radiation was administered to

all patients (Fig. 2). No anticancer therapy was administered on Days 6 through 14. Patients who had macroscopic disease received 5 cycles of chemoradiation,
whereas postsurgical patients with microscopic disease
received 4 cycles of chemoradiation. Chemoradiotherapy
was withheld only for an absolute neutrophil count
<500, fever, infection, or patient refusal, but not for
mucositis or dermatitis.
Radiotherapy was administered at 1.5 Gy per fraction twice daily with treatments separated by at least 6
hours on Days 1 through 5 on an alternating week schedule. Radiation was delivered with intensity-modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) planning for all patients.
Patients underwent CT simulation, usually with fusion of
PET or MRI images to assist with target delineation. Preinduction chemotherapy tumor volumes were targeted.
Macroscopic tumor volume received from 72 to
73.5 Gy, microscopic positive margins received 66 Gy,
high-risk microscopic disease (resected tumor bed or first
echelon of uninvolved lymph node stations) received 54
to 63 Gy, and low-risk microscopic disease (low-risk
lymph node stations) received 43.2 to 48 Gy. The microscopic volumes were covered with a simultaneous integrated boost plan. A separate cone down was performed
for patients with macroscopic disease. Patients received
the lower dose levels if they achieved a partial or complete
response to induction chemotherapy. The median dose
was 72 Gy (range, 60-72 Gy). The median duration of
treatment was 59 days (range, 46-87 days).
Induction Chemotherapy
Induction chemotherapy, which was administered off
protocol, was recommended for patients who had N2 or

N3 lymph node status with intact primary tumors or status post-tonsillectomy with the objective of decreasing
distant metastasis. Measurable disease was not considered
a requirement for induction chemotherapy. Twenty
patients (61%) received combined docetaxel (75 mg/m2),
cisplatin (75 mg/m2), and 5-FU (750 mg/m2  5 days)
every 3 weeks for 2 cycles.
Surgery
Seventeen patients (52%) underwent organ-conserving surgery before chemoradiation. This included 8 patients who
underwent with resection of the primary site and selective
neck dissection, 3 patients who underwent resection of the
primary site alone, and 6 patients who underwent neck dissection alone. Adverse pathology included 9 patients with
microscopic positive margins and 8 patients with perineural
invasion among 11 patients who underwent primary site
resection and 9 patients with multiple, pathologically positive lymph nodes and 12 patients with extracapsular extension among 14 patients who underwent pretreatment neck
dissection. Four patients underwent selective neck dissection after achieving a complete response of N2 or N3
lymph node disease to chemoradiation.
Quality of Life
Acute and late toxicities were scored using version 3.0 of
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events. The validated University of
Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOLR) questionnaire
was administered to patients before treatment, immediately after the completion of chemoradiation, and at
follow-up visits.
Treatment Evaluation and Statistical
Considerations
Recurrence-free survival was measured from the initiation
of nonsurgical treatment to either the last follow-up, disease
progression, or death using intent-to-treat methodology.
Failures were classified as local, regional, or distant. Survival
curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method
with Stata statistical software (version 9.1; Stata Corp.,
College Station, Tex). Differences in survival curves were
calculated with log-rank tests, and differences in mean
quality-of-life scores were calculated with 2-sided t tests.

RESULTS
In total, 33 patients were treated, and surviving patients
were followed for a median of 24 months (range, 17-32
months). The patient characteristics are summarized in

One patient discontinued radiation before completion
because of grade 3 mucositis, and another patient withdrew consent after 2 cycles of concurrent chemoradiation
but completed concurrent cisplatin and accelerated radiation off protocol. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. A
feeding tube or total parental nutrition was required by
36% of patients during or after treatment. The median
weight loss was 12% (range, 0%-17%). Acute, moderate
xerostomia was observed in 48% of patients; grade 3
mucositis was observed in 33% of patients; and grade 3
dermatitis was observed in 15% of patients. Only 18% of
patients developed grade 3 leukopenia, 12% developed
grade 3 neutropenia, 18% developed grade 3 anemia, and
3% developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia. No patients
developed neutropenic fever or infection during concurrent chemoradiation. Grade 2 or 3 acneiform rash was
observed in 15% of patients. Thrush, mouth sores related
to 5-FU, fatigue, thickened phlegm, and altered taste were
common acute adverse events that were managed with
supportive measures. Greater than 99% of the prescribed
radiation dose was delivered. Two patients had unplanned
treatment delays of 7 days because of noncompliance.
Survival and Patterns of Failure
The 2-year locoregional control, distant control, diseasefree survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 79%,
69%, and 86%, respectively (Fig. 3). The 2-year local
control rate was 94%, the 2-year regional control rate was
86%, and the 2-year rate of locoregional control with surgical salvage was 87%. To date, 10 patients (30%) have
experienced recurrence of their head and neck cancer. Patterns of failure were local only in 1 patient, regional only
in 2 patients, distant only in 5 patients, and both locoregional and distant in 2 patients. In addition, there was 1
second primary lung adenocarcinoma and 1 second primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus.

322

There was no significant difference in 2-year disease-free
survival between patients with oropharyngeal primaries
versus nonoropharyngeal primaries (71% vs 67%, respectively; P ¼ .7).
Long-Term Toxicity
To date, grade 3 late toxicities included 1 case each of
grade 3 frontal bone necrosis and grade 3 esophageal stricture. Additionally, one patient with tumor that extended
to the middle ear developed cartilage necrosis and unilateral hearing loss that required reconstruction. The rates of
long-term (>6 months) percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube dependence resulting from treatment
was 3%, and another 2 patients reported solid food dysphagia. One additional patient had a PEG tube in place
for 1 year that was removed after successful esophageal dilatation. It is noteworthy that 1 patient developed grade 2
skin hypopigmentation and grade 2 skin telangiectasia at
the site of grade 3 acute dermatitis (see Fig. 4, top left).
Grade 2 xerostomia was noted in 33% of patients. No
patients developed any visual problems or required tracheotomy because of toxicity.
Quality of Life
Twenty patients completed the UW-QOLR questionnaire before and after therapy (Fig. 4, top right). Compared with baseline scores, quality-of-life scores were
decreased after treatment (P < .001) and at 1 month after
chemoradiation (P ¼ .09). However, the scores returned
to baseline as early as 4 months after chemoradiation.

DISCUSSION
There is significant interest in adding epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors to existing chemoradiation regimens.17,20-22 In a phase 2 trial, cetuximab was

added to an intensive regimen of concurrent cisplatin and
concomitant boost radiotherapy. Although promising 3year locoregional control and overall survival rates of 78%
and 71%, respectively, were reported, that trial was closed
prematurely because of excessive adverse events.22 Compared with these data and with published results from
studies of concurrent cetuximab and radiation, we
reported promising rates of locoregional control and survival without excessive toxicity.10,22 In the current study,
we demonstrated that concurrent 5-FU, hydroxyurea,
cetuximab, and hyperfractionated IMRT is a promising
and reasonably well tolerated approach to incorporating
molecularly targeted therapy into the curative treatment
of locally advanced HNSCC. This regimen can be preceded by either surgery or induction chemotherapy without affecting tolerability.
Compared with published data from the University
of Chicago 9502 regimen of induction carboplatin and
paclitaxel for 6 weeks followed by concurrent 5-FU,
hydroxyurea, paclitaxel, and hyperfractionated radiation,

Cancer

we observed a numerically higher rate of locoregional and
distant failure at 2 years despite relatively short follow-up.16
One possibility is that substitution of cetuximab for paclitaxel reduced treatment intensity, particularly because
cetuximab was not continued during the week off. It is
noteworthy that our 2-year survival and disease control data
are similar to those reported with 5-FU, hydroxyurea, gefitinib, and hyperfractionated radiotherapy.16 In designing
future studies, we must consider whether the relatively
modest, elective lymph node doses that were considered
optimal in the setting of concurrent paclitaxel are adequate
when substituting an EGFR inhibitor.16 A second possibility may be the inclusion of a different patient population
with postsurgical patients who have disease with adverse pathology.7 A third possibility is our routine use of PET/CT
in surveillance, which may detect locoregional and distant
failures earlier.23 The excellent 2-year overall survival, combined with a relatively high distant metastasis rate despite
extensive use of induction chemotherapy, raises the possibility of earlier detection. Finally, based on promising phase

2 data suggesting that 6 weeks of taxane-based chemotherapy is effective for preventing distant metastases, only 2
cycles of induction docetaxel, 5-FU, and cisplatin were
administered.14,15 However, more recent phase 3 data suggest that 3 or 4 cycles of docetaxel, 5-FU, and cisplatin is
the preferred induction regimen and may further reduce
the incidence of distant metastases.13
Relative to published results of intensive 5-FU/
hydroxyurea-based chemoradiation using cisplatin or

324

paclitaxel, rates of mucosal and hematologic toxicity were
low.14,15 Whether this observation is because of decreasing chemotherapy intensity, exclusive use of IMRT with
increased dose conformality associated with a simultaneous integrated boost approach, patient selection, or
reduced doses of radiation in surgically resected patients is
unclear. There may be an increase in acute and late cutaneous toxicity associated with this treatment regimen,
although long-term quality of life after treatment

generally is good. Because the half-life of cetuximab is
approximately 7 days and the toxicity profile was favorable, currently, we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of
intensifying this regimen by continuing cetuximab on
Day 8 of each 14-day cycle (Fig. 2).24
In the literature, there is growing concern among
some oncologists that acute toxicity caused by treatment
intensification is reaching the limits of tolerability.25 An
ongoing, randomized phase 2 trial at the University of
Chicago is comparing concurrent 5-FU, hydroxyurea,
cetuximab, and hyperfractionated radiation versus concurrent cisplatin, cetuximab, and concomitant boost
radiotherapy after induction docetaxel, 5-FU, and cisplatin may identify a regimen that achieves an optimal balance between toxicity and efficacy.4 Ultimately, we may
individualize treatment intensity based on predictors of
response to conventional and intensified therapies.26 Predictors of response to EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC
remain elusive, and it is unknown whether human papillomavirus (HPV) status will be useful in selecting appropriate therapy.27 Currently, our group is reviewing the
HPV and EGFR status of treated patients to determine
whether specific subgroups benefited from protocol therapy. On the basis of the published literature, patients with
HPV-positive disease have a more favorable prognosis
with standard therapy and are unlikely to benefit from
further treatment intensification.28 Conversely, HPVnegative patients continue to experience high rates of
treatment failure despite intensive combined-modality
therapy and may benefit from novel therapeutic
approaches. In conclusion, the current results indicate
that concurrent 5-FU, hydroxyurea, cetuximab, and
hyperfractionated IMRT is a promising and reasonably
well tolerated approach for incorporating molecularly targeted therapy into curative therapy for patients with
locally advanced head and neck cancer.
