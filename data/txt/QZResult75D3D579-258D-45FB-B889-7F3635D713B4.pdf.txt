ABSTRACT
Imatinib Mesylate (IM) and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies have
had a major impact on the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However,
TKI monotherapy is not curative, with relapse and persistence of leukemic stem cells
(LSCs) remaining a challenge. We have recently identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2
protein complex that contributes to the transforming activity of BCR-ABL and IMresistance in CML stem/progenitor cells. JAK2 thus emerges as an attractive target
for improved therapies, but off-target effects of newly developed JAK2 inhibitors on
normal hematopoietic cells remain a concern. We have examined the biological effects
of a highly selective, orally bioavailable JAK2 inhibitor, BMS-911543, in combination
with TKIs on CD34+ treatment-naïve IM-nonresponder cells. Combination therapy
reduces JAK2/STAT5 and CRKL activities, induces apoptosis, inhibits proliferation and
colony growth, and eliminates CML LSCs in vitro. Importantly, BMS-911543 selectively
targets CML stem/progenitor cells while sparing healthy stem/progenitor cells. Oral
BMS-911543 combined with the potent TKI dasatinib more effectively eliminates
infiltrated leukemic cells in hematopoietic tissues than TKI monotherapy and enhances
survival of leukemic mice. Dual targeting BCR-ABL and JAK2 activities in CML stem/
progenitor cells may consequently lead to more effective disease eradication,
especially in patients at high risk of TKI resistance and disease progression.

INTRODUCTION

acquired TKI resistance remain significant issues [10,
11]. Despite the effectiveness of TKI monotherapy, most
patients harbor residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and
disease typically recurs if therapy is discontinued [12,
13]. Furthermore, 15-20% of patients with early CPCML and up to 40% with accelerated phase (AP-CML)
disease fail treatment, indicating a need for alternative
approaches. LSCs are known to be genetically unstable
and less responsive to TKI treatments, and are of critical
importance in mediating TKI resistance [14-17]. Recent
studies have indicated that CML LSCs might not be
exclusively dependent on BCR-ABL TK activity for
their survival [18, 19]. These observations emphasize the
need to develop new therapeutic agents and combination

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a lethal
hematological malignancy defined by the presence of a
BCR-ABL fusion gene originating in a hematopoietic
stem cell (HSC) [1, 2]. The BCR-ABL oncoprotein has
constitutively active tyrosine kinase (TK) activity, which
drives the disease phenotype by perturbing multiple
signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK,
and JAK2/STAT5 [3, 4]. The treatment of chronic
phase CML (CP-CML) has been significantly improved
by Imatinib Mesylate (IM) and other tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies [5-9]. TKI monotherapies are
not, however, curative and early relapse and primary and

strategies to target TKI resistant LSC subclones.
Evidence suggests that the Janus kinase 2/
signal transducers and activators of transcription 5
(JAK2/STAT5) pathway plays a critical role in CML
leukemogenesis [3, 4]. In particular, JAK2 interacts
directly with the C-terminal region of BCR-ABL and
is a key interaction partner of BCR-ABL in CML [20,
21]. This complex enhances BCR-ABL TK activity and
disrupts BCR-ABL-mediated signaling in BCR-ABL+
cells, possibly through direct phosphorylation of tyrosine
177 of BCR-ABL by JAK2 [20, 21]. We have recently
identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 protein complex
that contributes both to the transforming activity of BCRABL and to IM-resistance in CML stem/progenitor cells.
Disrupting this complex results in the elimination of
IM-resistant BCR-ABL+ cells and primary CML stem/
progenitor cells [22, 23]. Similarly, STAT5, a direct
substrate of JAK2, is constitutively active in BCR-ABLtransduced cells [24, 25], and over-expression of Stat5 in
murine BM cells generates a disease phenotype closely
resembling BCR-ABL-induced CML [26]. High STAT5
levels were also found to mediate acquired IM resistance
in CML cells and STAT5 inhibitors reduced their
survival [27, 28]. Thus, targeting JAK2/STAT5 activity is
consequently rational and complementary to the inhibition
of BCR-ABL TK activity in CML stem/progenitor cells.
Several JAK2 inhibitors are currently in various stages
of clinical development in myeloproliferative neoplasms
[29], including myelofibrosis [30, 31] and AML [32], but
their off-target effects on healthy primitive hematopoietic
cells remains challenging [29, 33, 34]. Here, we examine
the potential relevance of JAK2 inhibition in CML by
examining the biological effects of a highly selective,
orally bioavailable JAK2 inhibitor BMS-911543 alone
and in combination with second generation TKIs,
including dasatinib (DA), on CD34+ treatment-naïve IMnonresponder cells. We demonstrate that dual inhibition
of JAK2/STAT5 and BCR-ABL is more effective in
eliminating CML LSCs, but not their healthy counterparts,
than TKIs alone in vitro, and significantly enhances
progression free survival in mice.

activity. Phosphorylated STAT5 was analyzed by Western
blot analysis in K562 cells and a spontaneously-derived
cell line that is relatively resistant to IM (K562R), but has
no BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations [36]. Combination
treatment of BMS-911543 and IM was more effective
at reducing p-STAT5 levels in K562R cells compared
with IM or BMS-911543 alone (70% vs. 45% and 10%
reduction, P<0.03, Fig. 1A). This combination effect
was not observed in IM-sensitive K562 cells. Increased
STAT5 protein expression was observed in K562R cells
as compared with IM-sensitive K562 cells. BMS-911543
and IM together also resulted in a greater reduction than
IM alone in both total colony numbers and colony size
produced from K562R cells in CFC assays (2-3 fold,
P=0.028, Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained from
BV173 cells, a cell line derived from a CML blast crisis
patient (P=0.02, Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the
combination of BMS-911543 and IM result in a deeper
suppression of p-STAT5 and more effectively reduce the
proliferative capacity of IM-resistant cells than either
single agent alone.

The combination of BMS-911543 and TKIs
reduces BCR-ABL and JAK2/STAT5 activity and
induces apoptosis of CD34+ treatment-naïve IMnonresponder cells
To investigate whether this dual BCR-ABL-JAK2
targeting approach may also be therapeutically effective
for CML patients who do not respond adequately
to treatment with a single TKI, we investigated the
molecular and biological effects in primitive CML cells
obtained at diagnosis from CML patients (n=7) classified
retrospectively following initiation of IM monotherapy, as
IM-nonresponders [37, 38]. A concentration of 300 nM for
BMS-911543 was selected based on the 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) obtained in BaF3 cells transduced
with a constitutively active JAK2 construct but lacking
V617F mutation [35]. Notably, this concentration (300
nM) showed no toxic effects on CD34+ normal bone
marrow (NBM) cells (~2% Annexin V positive cells,
Supplementary Fig. 1A). Interestingly, intracellular
staining showed that combined exposure of CD34+ IMnonresponder cells (n=4) to BMS-911543 (300 nM) and a
TKI (5 µM IM; 150 nM DA) produced a deeper and more
prolonged suppression of p-STAT5 activity (60-65%) than
IM or DA alone (20-25%) after 72 hours (P<0.05, Fig.
2A). P-CRKL activity, a direct target of BCR-ABL kinase
was also suppressed more by combination treatment than
single agents (70-90% vs. 45-65%, P<0.04).
While BMS-911543 (300 nM) had minimal effects
on apoptosis and single TKIs (5 µM IM; 150 nM DA; 5
µM NL) increased the percentage of Annexin V positive
cells by 10-20%, the combination treatment increased
Annexin V positive cells to 20-30% at 48 hours, with

To determine the effect of a highly selective JAK2
inhibitor (BMS-911543) [35] alone or in combination
with IM on CML cells, we examined changes in the

kinase and can be used as a measure of JAK2 kinase

a significant increase as a result of the combination
treatment after 72 hours (2-fold, P<0.05, Fig. 2B). These
results indicate that the combination of BMS-911543 and
TKIs markedly and durably inhibits the activity of BCRABL and JAK2/STAT5 and is more effective in inducing
apoptosis in IM-insensitive CML stem/progenitor cells.
Critically, the combination of BMS-911543, at a clinically
achievable concentration, with TKIs displayed minimal
toxic effects in CD34+ NBM cells compared to CD34+
CML cells (4-8% vs. 32-36%, P<0.01, Fig. 2B).
To further determine whether the combination
of BMS-911543 and a TKI had synergistic or addictive
effect, we performed viability assays on CD34+ CML

cells with graded doses of BMS-911543 and DA, alone or
in combination, for 72 hours. The results were analyzed
using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) to calculate CI, and
an algebraic estimate and a conservative isobologram
were generated (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). At doses
ranging from 150 to 600 nM of BMS-911543, and from
75 to 300 nM of DA, the average CI for ED50, ED75,
and ED90 was calculated to be 0.597 (Supplementary Fig.
2A), indicating that the combination is highly synergistic.
The conservative isobologram analysis further confirmed
synergism between the two drugs (Supplementary Fig.
2B).

almost completely inhibits erythroid-burst forming
unit (BFU-E) colony formation compared to TKI alone
(97-98% vs. 65-80%, P<0.03, Fig. 3B). Granulocyte/
macrophage-colony forming unit (CFU-GM) colonies
were also more significantly reduced by the combination
than single agents (45-60% vs. 20-40%, P<0.004, Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, LTC-IC stem cells assays showed that the
more primitive cells were more significantly eliminated
by combination treatments than single agents (3-6-fold,
P<0.04, Fig. 3D), indicating the potential benefit of
combination therapy for targeting LSCs. Similar to the
results obtained by apoptosis assay, the combination of
BMS-911543 and TKIs has significantly less toxicity
on CD34+ NBM cells than CD34+ CML cells (n=4,
P<0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 1B). These results suggest

that combination treatment with BMS-911543 and TKI is
more effective in eliminating very primitive CML stem
and progenitor cells from IM-nonresponders destined to
develop TKI resistance.

Combined treatment with the selective JAK2
inhibitor BMS-911543 and TKIs significantly
enhances the survival of leukemic mice
To assess the ability of combination treatment to
eliminate primitive BCR-ABL+ cells with in vivo leukemia
propagating activity, we utilized human BV173 cells,
which have been shown to generate a lethal leukemia in
NOD/SCID mice [22, 39]. BV173 cells (2.5x106) were

expressed as a percentage of values obtained in untreated cells to which only DMSO was added. The percentage of colonies containing

intravenously injected into sub-lethally irradiated NSG
mice, which were then treated with inhibitors (alone or in
combination) or a vehicle control by oral gavage for two
weeks. In the first pilot experiment, mice were treated with
vehicle control (propylene glycol), BMS-911543 (15 mg/
kg), IM (50 mg/kg), and IM (50 mg/kg) plus BMS-911543
(15 mg/kg) twice a day for two weeks by oral gavage two
weeks after BV173 cells injection. The combination of
IM plus BMS-911543 significantly enhanced survival of
leukemic mice as compared with mice treated with single
agents only (median survival of IM + BMS-911543 vs. IM
or BMS-911543: 70 days vs. 53 days or 54 days, P<0.02,
Fig. 4A). Mice receiving combination treatment also had
significantly reduced weight loss as compared with mice
treated with single agents (Fig. 4A). We then investigated
whether combining BMS-911543 with a more potent TKI,
dasatinib (DA), might achieve better results in vivo. NSG
mice (n = 5-6 mice per condition) injected with the same
numbers of BV173 cells were treated with vehicle control,
BMS-911543 (15 mg/kg), DA (15 mg/kg), and DA plus

BMS-911543 once a day for two weeks by oral gavage.
Significantly prolonged survival was observed in leukemic
mice treated with DA plus BMS-911543 compared to DA
alone (median survival of DA + BMS-911543 vs. DA:
96.5 days vs. 81 days, P=0.0007, Fig. 4B), as well as
significantly reduced weight loss.

for analysis at 54 days post-transplant. We observed
significantly enlarged hematopoietic organs, including
spleen and liver, in mice treated with vehicle control or
BMS-911543 alone but not in mice treated with DA and
DA plus BMS-911543 (Fig. 5A). H&E staining revealed

no infiltration of leukemic cells to the spleen, whereas
mice treated with vehicle or BMS-911543 alone had

in DA-treated mice. In contrast, vehicle control and

BMS-911543-treated mice were heavily infiltrated with

indeed transplanted leukemic cells (Fig. 5B). Although

had fewer CD19+ cells in PB, BM, spleen, and liver than

pronounced in mice receiving combination treatment (Fig.
5D). Q-RT-PCR analysis further demonstrated statistically
significant reduction in BCR-ABL transcript levels in mice
treated with the combination compared to DA alone (BM:
undetectable, P=0.0008; liver: 11-fold reduction, P=0.022,
Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis demonstrated high levels
of phosphorylation and protein expression of BCR-ABL,
p-STAT5 and p-CRKL in BM cells from vehicle control
and BMS-911543-treated mice, but undetectable levels in
mice treated with DA or DA plus BMS-911543 mice (Fig.
5E).
At day 70 post-transplant, the difference in
infiltration of leukemic cells in hematopoietic organs
between mice injected with DA alone or DA plus BMS911543 was more pronounced. Enlarged spleens and livers
were observed in mice treated with DA alone, but not in
mice treated with DA plus BMS-911543 (Fig. 6A). H&E
and IHC staining of spleen and liver revealed increased
infiltration of leukemic cells in DA or vehicle-treated
mice, but very low levels in DA plus BMS-911543-treated
mice (Fig. 6B). In addition, mice receiving combination
treatment showed significantly reduced engraftment
levels in PB, BM, and spleen compared to mice treated
with DA alone (0.2% vs. 6.1%, 1.2% vs. 26%, and 2.5%
vs. 52%, Fig. 6C). It was observed that relatively higher
levels of engrafted cells occurred in the liver as compared
to other tissues under the combination treatment. Finally,
BCR-ABL transcript levels in mice treated with DA plus
BMS-911543 were much lower than mice treated with DA
alone (BM: 20-fold reduction, P=0.0005; spleen: 32-fold
reduction, P=0.006; liver: 2-fold reduction, P=0.0005; Fig.
6D). Western blot analysis further showed highly increased
levels of phosphorylation and protein expression of BCRABL, p-STAT5 and p-CRKL in mice treated with DA
alone compared to DA plus BMS-911543 (Fig. 6E). Taken
together, these results suggest that the oral combination
treatment is much more effective than either agent alone
in eliminating primitive human CML cells able to generate
aggressive leukemia in mice, with significantly enhanced
survival of leukemic mice.

treatment-naive IM-nonresponder cells supports this
hypothesis. We demonstrated that BMS-911543, at
clinically achievable concentrations, in combination
with a TKI markedly reduced the output of progenitor
colonies and eradicated their more primitive stem cells in
vitro (Fig. 3). The combination was also more effective
at reducing p-CRKL and p-STAT5 activities in these
cells at the molecular level (Fig. 2). In addition, the
combination treatment displays synergism, suggesting that
simultaneously targeting BCR-ABL and JAK2 activities in
CML stem/progenitor cells is indeed more effective than
using single agents.
Since transplantation of primary CML stem/
progenitor cells is not able to generate leukemia in
immunodeficient mice [22], we screened several BCRABL+ human cell lines to determine which could generate
leukemia in vivo and found that human BV173 cells, but
not K562 cells, are capable of infiltrating into multiple
hematopoietic organs and generating a lethal leukemia
in NSG mice. Thus, this is a useful model for examining
efficacy of drug treatment in BCR-ABL+ human cells
in vivo. Indeed, in vivo oral administration of BMS911543 and TKI for two weeks significantly eliminated
infiltrated leukemic cells to a greater extent in multiple
hematopoietic tissues than TKI monotherapy (Fig. 4-6). A
statistically significant prolonged survival of treated mice
was obtained using the combination treatment, whereas
IM or BMS-911543 alone was ineffective at preventing
disease development. Compared with IM, dasatinib is
not only a dual SRC-ABL inhibitor, but it is also 300fold more potent in inhibiting ABL kinase in vitro, and
induces much greater and faster rates of major molecular
response in patients. [7, 40, 41]. Therefore, treatment
with the potent TKI dasatinib alone appears to be more
effective at prolonging disease survival than IM alone,
and the combination of BMS-911543 and dasatinib even
more significantly enhances survival of leukemic mice
and prevents infiltration of leukemic cells in multiple
hematopoietic tissues. Our study suggests a new strategy
for treating CP-CML patients at risk of developing TKI
resistance and for targeting more aggressive leukemic cells
present in later stage CML patients, which are routinely
only poorly responsive to TKI monotherapy [10, 11].
Consistent with our studies, it has been reported
that disrupting the BCR-ABL/JAK2-STAT5 network
eliminates BCR-ABL-transduced cells and primitive
CD34+ CML cells; JAK2 inhibitors have been shown to
sensitize CML cells to TKIs in the BM microenvironment
[42-44]. Knockdown of JAK2 using a shRNA
approach reduced BCR-ABL expression, which further
downregulated STAT5 activity [20], and suppression of
JAK2 also reduced protein levels of β-catenin protein [45],
possibly through activation of GSK-3β [21]. In addition,
JAK2 siRNA knockdown reduced BCR-ABL-mediated
c-Myc expression [21, 46]. On the other hand, it was
reported that BCR-ABL directly phosphorylates STAT5

DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide pre-clinical evidence that
combination treatment with a selective JAK2 inhibitor
(BMS-911543) and TKI more effectively eradicates IMinsensitive BCR-ABL+ cells and primary CML stem/
progenitor cells compared to either BMS-911543 or TKI
alone, suggesting a potential new treatment option for
patients with CML. Specifically, we examined whether
combination treatment might be a much better strategy
for CML patients who are unlikely to respond to TKI
monotherapies. These patients might benefit from such
a treatment, which could more effectively reduce the
CML stem cell burden, avoiding the development of
TKI-resistance and disease relapse. Our study on CD34+

in BCR-ABL-transduced cells [25], and that Jak2 is not
required for initial myeloid transformation and leukemia
maintenance in a Jak2 conditional knockout model [47].
This discrepancy could be due to the different model
systems and cell types used in these studies. For example,
it is known that BCR-ABL-transduced murine BM cells,
transduced using a retroviral transduction model, express
much higher levels of BCR-ABL than physiologically
primary CML cells from patients’ blood or BM samples
and that the role of JAK2 in enhancing cell survival might
not be required in these BCR-ABL over-expressing cells,
rendering JAK2 dispensable. Indeed, increasing evidence
indicates that the canonical JAK2/STAT5 pathway is
critical for primary CML stem/progenitor cells, which
rely on cytokine-activated JAK2/STAT5 signaling in
addition to BCR-ABL signaling [34, 43, 44, 48, 49]. It has
been reported that activation of BCR-ABL stimulates the
production of cytokines, including IL-3, G-CSF and GMCSF, which bind to their cognate receptors and contribute
to TKI resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells through
activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway [44, 48]. It was
also reported that BCR-ABL interacts with the IL-3/GMCSF receptor, which leads to the downstream activation of
JAK2 [49], and that blockage of JAK2-mediated extrinsic
survival signals using JAK2 inhibitors restores sensitivity
of CML cells to TKIs [43]. We and others have shown
that destabilization of the BCR-ABL/JAK2 network
with JAK2 inhibitors and TKIs dissociates their physical
interaction and sensitizes CML LSCs to TKIs. These
effects are not observed in the same cells treated with
TKIs alone or even with combination of TKIs [20-22, 42].
Consequently, these findings provide compelling evidence
that JAK2/STAT5 signaling represents an important node
supporting CML LSC growth and survival. Targeting
BCR-ABL-JAK2 cooperative activities may reverse
the innate TKI-resistance phenotype of CML LSCs and
sensitize them to TKI.
BMS-911543 is a highly-selective JAK2 inhibitor
which has an IC50 of 1.1 nM with little effects on JAK1
(356 nM), JAK3 (73 nM), or TYK2 (66 nM), respectively
[35]. It is highly specific; no other non-JAK family targets
with an IC50 of less than 100 nM have been reported
[29]. It is currently being investigated in a Phase 1/2a
clinical trial in myelofibrosis (ClinicalTrals.gov identifier:
NCT01236352) [33]. It thus provides a rational basis for
a therapeutic combination strategy applying BMS-911543
and a TKI in CML. We found that BMS-911543 alone had
limited inhibitory effects on primary CML stem/progenitor
cells when its concentration was non-toxic to primitive
healthy BM cells. Similarly, no significant changes in
phosphorylation levels of the BCR-ABL kinase substrate
CRKL were observed when these cells were treated
with BMS-911543 monotherapy. This suggests specific
inhibition of JAK2 downstream of BCR-ABL, and its
effects can be significantly enhanced by combining with a
TKI. This observation also reduces concerns of off-target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects of BMS-911543 on other kinases and signaling
proteins that result in toxicity and have been reported for
several other JAK2 inhibitors [29, 33, 47, 50, 51]. Taken
together, this pre-clinical study provides strong scientific
rational for the continued investigation of JAK2 inhibition
as a therapeutic strategy in CML and demonstrates the
potential merit of combining a highly JAK2-specific
inhibitor with potent TKIs to specifically target CML
stem/progenitor cells, especially in CML patients likely to
develop TKI-resistance if treated with TKI monotherapy.

METHODS	
Human cells
Heparin-anticoagulated peripheral blood (PB)
cells were obtained from newly-diagnosed patients prior
to TKI therapy that were clinically classified, following
IM monotherapy, as IM-nonresponders, based on the
European Leukemia Net treatment guidelines [37, 38].
Bone marrow (NBM) cells were also obtained from
healthy adult donors. Informed consent was obtained
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the
procedures used approved by the Research Ethics Board
at the University of British Columbia. Mononuclear cells
were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich)
density gradient separation and CD34+ cells (>85%) were
enriched immunomagnetically using the EasySep CD34
positive selection kit (STEMCELL Technologies). Purity
was verified using fluorescence-activated cell sorter
(FACS) analysis as described [22].

Reagents
BMS-911543 and dasatinib (DA) were provided by
Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, USA). IM and nilotinib
(NL) were obtained from Novartis (Novartis, Basel,
Switzerland). Stock solutions of 10 mM were prepared
with water (IM) or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (DA,
NL, and BMS-911543) and stored at -20°C.

Suspension cultures and analysis of drug
interactions
CD34+ cells were cultured in Iscove’s medium
plus bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, transferrin
(STEMCELL Technologies) and 10-4 M 2-mercaptoethanol
supplemented with four growth factors (20 ng/mL IL3, 20 ng/mL IL-6, 100ng/mL Flt3-ligand, and 20 ng/
mL G-CSF), with or without drug treatments. CML cell
lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 media as described
[22]. Cell counts and viability were assessed using trypan
blue dye exclusion. Analysis of drug interactions in the
8646

Oncotarget

Transplantation of immunodeficient mice with
CML cells

combination treatment group of BMS-911543 with DA
was assessed after 72 hours of suspension culture with
drug exposure using total viable cell counts. Data were
analyzed using constant-ratio drug combinations and
the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay [52]. The
combination Index (CI) was calculated using CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). CI<
1, CI = 1 or CI > 1 represent synergistic, additive or
antagonistic effects respectively.

BV173 cells (2.5 × 106 cells per treatment condition)
were injected intravenously into 8- to 10-week-old,
sub-lethally cesium irradiated (315 cGy) NOD/SCIDinterleukin 2 receptor γ–chain-deficient (NSG) mice. Two
weeks post-transplant, mice were treated with vehicle
and inhibitors once or twice a day for two weeks by oral
gavage. Mice were monitored daily for body weight
changes and survival during and after treatment. The level
of engraftment of BV173 cells in the PB, BM, spleen, and
liver was determined with anti-human CD19PE antibody
(1:250 dilution) (eBioscience) and FACS analysis. For
histopathology analysis, spleens and livers were fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H-&-E), or with antihuman CD19 antibody (Abcam) for immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining. Images of histological slides were
captured on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope
(Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a Retiga EXi colour
digital camera (Burnaby, Canada). Animal experiments
were performed in the Animal Resource Centre of the
BC Cancer Agency Research Centre, using procedures
approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University
of British Columbia (Vancouver).

Intracellular staining
After 72 hours of suspension culture with drug
exposure, CD34+ CML cells were stained with p-CRKL
(Cell Signaling) or p-STAT5 antibodies (Cell Signaling)
overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary
antibody (anti–rabbit IgG FITC-conjugate, Invitrogen)
prior to FACS analysis as previously described [53].
P-CRKL and p-STAT5 levels were determined as the
geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) subtracted
by the MFI of cells stained with isotype IgG control, and
were normalized as a percentage of control cells incubated
for the same time with DMSO only.

Apoptosis assays
After 48 and 72 hours of suspension culture with
drug treatments, apoptosis assays were performed on
CD34+ NBM cells and CD34+ CML cells using an
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit APC (eBioscience).
Briefly, cells were stained with Annexin V APC and
Propidium Iodide (PI) and analyzed using a FACSCalibur
(BD Bioscience). Total apoptotic cell populations were
determined as the sum of the “early” apoptotic cells
(Annexin V+ only) and “late” apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/
PI+).

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life
Technologies) [55]. Glycogen (10µg/ml, Life
Technologies) was added as a carrier to facilitate visibility
of the RNA pellet. RNA (100 ng) was reversed transcribed
into cDNA with SuperScript® VILOTM Master Mix (Life
Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
and specific primers to detect BCR-ABL transcripts were
as previously described [15].

Colony-forming cell (CFC) and long-term cultureinitiating cell (LTC-IC) assays

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in protein solubilization buffer
(PSB) and analyzed by Western blotting as previously
described [54]. Antibodies used were anti-human STAT5
(Millipore), anti-phospho-STAT5 (Cell Signaling), antiphospho-tyrosine (4G10, Millipore), anti-ABL (8E9, BD
Biosciences), anti-phospho-CRKL (Cell Signaling), and
anti-human GAPDH (Sigma Aldrich).

CFC assays were performed as previously described
[54]. Briefly, 600 K562R cells, 1,500 BV173 or 3,000
CD34+ cells were mixed in 3 mL methylcellulose medium
(STEMCELL Technologies) with or without inhibitors.
Colonies produced were counted after 14 to 16 days of
incubation. LTC-IC assays were performed with CD34+
cells on M2-10B4 stromal cells as previously described
[22]. Cultures were maintained for six weeks with weekly
half-medium changes, plus inhibitors for two weeks. Cells
were then harvested and CFC assays performed to obtain
total numbers of LTC-IC-derived CFCs.
