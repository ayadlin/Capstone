Abstract

Author Manuscript

The TRIM37 (or MUL) gene is located in the 17q23 chromosomal region, which is amplified in up
to ~40% of breast cancers1. TRIM37 contains a RING finger domain, a hallmark of E3 ubiquitin
ligases2, but its protein substrate(s) is unknown. Here we report that TRIM37 mono-ubiquitinates
histone H2A, a chromatin modification associated with transcriptional repression3. We find that in
human breast cancer cell lines containing amplified 17q23, TRIM37 is upregulated and,
reciprocally, the major H2A ubiquitin ligase RNF23,4 (also called RING1B) is downregulated.
Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip experiments in 17q23-amplified breast
cancer cells identified many genes, including multiple tumour suppressors, whose promoters were
bound by TRIM37 and enriched for ubiquitinated H2A (H2A-ub). However, unlike RNF2, which
is a subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)3–5, we find that TRIM37 associates with
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). TRIM37, PRC2 and PRC1 are co-bound to specific
target genes resulting in their transcriptional silencing. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated

knockdown of TRIM37 results in loss of H2A-ub, dissociation of PRC1 and PRC2 from target
promoters, and transcriptional reactivation of silenced genes. Knockdown of TRIM37 in human
breast cancer cells containing amplified 17q23 substantially decreases tumour growth in mouse
xenografts. Conversely, ectopic expression of TRIM37 renders non-transformed cells tumorigenic.
Collectively, our results reveal TRIM37 as an oncogenic H2A ubiquitin ligase that is
overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers and promotes transformation by facilitating silencing
of tumour suppressors and other genes.
We previously identified TRIM37 as a factor required for epigenetic silencing of the Fas
tumour suppressor gene, and found that TRIM37 was bound to the silenced Fas promoter in
Kras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells6. Mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 is
associated with transcriptional repression3 and we considered the possibility that TRIM37
was a histone H2A E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Author Manuscript

To test this idea, we first performed ChIP experiments to assess H2A-ub levels on the
epigenetically repressed Fas promoter. H2A-ub was enriched at the silenced Fas promoter
in Kras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, which was lost following small hairpin RNA (shRNA)mediated knockdown of TRIM37 (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). By contrast, H2A-ub was
retained following knockdown of RNF2, the major H2A ubiquitin ligase involved in gene
regulation3,4, or BMI1, a PRC1 component7,8 that stimulates RNF2 activity7,9.

Author Manuscript

We next assessed whether TRIM37 could mono-ubiquitinate H2A at lysine 119. Purified
recombinant TRIM37 or, as a positive control, the RNF2/BMI1 complex, was incubated in
the presence of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme,
ATP and HA-tagged ubiquitin. Like RNF2/BMI1, TRIM37 could mono-ubiquitinate
purified H2A, but not an H2A derivative mutated at the K118/K119 ubiquitination site
(H2A-KKRR)10 or H2B (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1d). By contrast, a TRIM37
derivative bearing a point mutation in a conserved cysteine residue in the RING finger motif
(C18R), which interferes with catalytic activity2, failed to promote H2A monoubiquitination (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, wild-type TRIM37, but not TRIM37-C18R, could
mono-ubiquitinate H2A in an assembled nucleosome (Fig. 1b).

Author Manuscript

We next analysed the relationship between expression of TRIM37 and RNF2 in several
human breast cancer cell lines containing amplified 17q23 (MCF7, BT474 and MDAMB-361)11. As controls, we analysed in parallel a non-transformed human breast epithelial
cell line that lacked 17q23 amplification (MCF10A) and immortalized human mammary
epithelial cells (HMECs). Breast cancer cell lines containing amplified 17q23 expressed
substantially higher levels of TRIM37, but lower levels of RNF2, compared to MCF10A
cells and HMECs (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g).
Consistent with these expression results, knockdown of TRIM37 in MCF7, BT474 or MDAMD-361 cells markedly decreased total H2A-ub levels (Fig. 1c, left and Extended Data Fig.
1h–j). By contrast, knockdown of RNF2 (Extended Data Fig. 1k) in MCF7 cells had only a
modest effect on H2A-ub levels (Fig. 1c, right), but substantially reduced H2A-ub levels in
MCF10A cells (Fig. 1d). Moreover, knockdown of TRIM37 did not have a major effect on

H2A-ub levels in breast cancer cell lines lacking 17q23 amplification (Extended data Fig. 1l,
m).
The expression results of Extended Data Fig. 1e, f suggested a reciprocal relationship
between TRIM37 and RNF2 expression levels. Consistent with this possibility, ectopic
expression of TRIM37 in MCF10A cells (Extended Data Fig. 1n) resulted in downregulation
of RNF2 (Fig. 1e).

Author Manuscript

To identify TRIM37 target genes in MCF7 cells, we performed global ChIP-chip analysis
and identified 9412 genes that were bound by TRIM37, 7638 of which were also enriched
for H2A-ub (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Knockdown of
TRIM37 resulted in loss or reduction of H2A-ub in ~75% of these genes (Fig. 2b, Extended
Data Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Table 1). Searches of cancer-gene databases revealed
that 469 TRIM37 target genes are putative tumour suppressors (Supplementary Table 1).
Notably, there was a statistically significant enrichment of putative tumour suppressors
among the genes bound by TRIM37 (P = 1.99e-5).
To validate the ChIP-chip results, we analysed a representative set of 22 putative tumour
suppressor and other genes in directed ChIP experiments using promoter-specific primer
pairs. For all 22 genes analysed, TRIM37 and H2A-ub were significantly enriched at the
promoter (Fig. 2c, d and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). For the majority of these genes,
enrichment of H2A-ub substantially decreased following knockdown of TRIM37 but not
RNF2 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). Finally, knockdown of TRIM37 but not RNF2
substantially increased expression of all TRIM37 target genes analysed (Fig. 2e and
Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). Knockdown of TRIM37 in BT474 cells also resulted in increased
expression of a subset of TRIM37 target genes analysed (Extended Data Fig. 3f–h).

Previous studies have shown that RNF2 functions through association with PRC13–5. We
next performed a series of experiments to determine whether TRIM37 also functioned
through PRCs. We first asked whether TRIM37 was physically associated with PRC1 or
PRC2. To test this idea, MCF7 cell nuclear extract was fractionated by sucrose gradient
sedimentation and individual fractions analysed by immunoblotting for TRIM37 and PRC
subunits. The results of Fig. 3a show that TRIM37 co-sedimented with PRC2 subunits
EZH2 and SUZ128,12,13. Physical interactions between TRIM37 and PRC2 subunits could
be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e and Supplementary
Table 2), an in vitro pull-down assay (Extended Data Fig. 4f), and the ability of a GAL4TRIM37 fusion-protein to recruit PRC2 subunits to GAL4 binding sites (Extended Data Fig.
4g).
Global ChIP-chip analysis identified 3384 genes that were co-bound by TRIM37 and EZH2
(Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). In addition, 3560 genes were
bound by TRIM37 and enriched for histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Fig.
3d, Extended Data Fig. 2a, c and Supplementary Table 4). Knockdown of TRIM37 resulted
in loss or reduction of H3K27me3 in ~65% of these genes (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 2a, d
and Supplementary Table 4). Several studies have reported global correlations between

PRC1/PRC2 occupancy and CpG islands14–18. We found no statistically significant
difference between the percentage of promoters co-bound by TRIM37 and EZH2 or bound
by EZH2 alone that contain a CpG island (Extended Data Fig. 2e).
To validate the ChIP-chip results, we analysed a representative set of TRIM37 target genes
for binding of EZH2 and BMI1 by directed ChIP assays. All gene promoters analysed were
enriched for BMI1 and EZH2, which was diminished following TRIM37 knockdown (Fig.
3f and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). These gene promoters were also enriched for H3K27me3,
which was reduced following TRIM37 knockdown (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 5d). As
expected, knockdown of BMI1 or EZH2 resulted in increased expression of these genes
(Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 5e, f).

Author Manuscript

Our results raised the possibility that in breast cancers containing amplified 17q23, TRIM37
is over-expressed and contributes to transformation by silencing tumour suppressor genes.
To investigate the relationship between TRIM37 levels and expression of TRIM37 target
genes, we analysed a published comprehensive dataset of 466 human breast cancer
samples19. Of the 9412 TRIM37 target genes we identified, there was a statistically
significant correlation between increased TRIM37 levels and decreased expression of 2794
genes (Supplementary Table 5). The heat map of Fig. 4a shows the results for 60 TRIM37
target genes in a subset of breast cancer samples in which TRIM37 is either under- or overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Author Manuscript

To confirm that elevated TRIM37 levels were responsible for decreased TRIM37 target
gene expression, we analysed expression of representative TRIM37 target genes in
MCF10A cells ectopically expressing TRIM37. Expression of all TRIM37 target genes
analysed was significantly lower in cells ectopically expressing TRIM37 compared to empty
vector (Fig. 4b).
To directly investigate the potential oncogenic activity of TRIM37, we knocked down
TRIM37 in MCF7 cells and measured the effect on tumorigenicity in mouse xenografts.
Knockdown of TRIM37 markedly reduced tumour growth (Fig. 4c) without affecting
proliferation of cultured MCF7 cells (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Knockdown of
TRIM37 also reduced tumour formation in xenografts derived from BT474 and FCIBC02
breast cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c).

Author Manuscript

Conversely, ectopic expression of wild-type TRIM37 (Extended Data Fig. 7d), but not
TRIM37-C18R, transformed NIH 3T3 cells, enabling tumour formation in mice (Fig. 4e).
Moreover, ectopic expression of TRIM37 (Extended Data Fig. 7e) also transformed
MCF10AT cells, a pre-malignant MCF10A derivative stably expressing activated HRAS20,
enabling growth in soft agar (Fig. 4f) and tumour formation in mice (Fig. 4g). Furthermore,
knockdown of a subset of TRIM37 target genes with predicted tumour suppressor activity
also transformed MCF10AT cells (Extended Data Fig. 7f–h). By contrast, TRIM37 could
not transform parental MCF10A cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i, j) indicating that TRIM37 can
cooperate with RAS to transform human breast epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of
TRIM37 also transformed HMLER and BPLER cells, immortalized human breast epithelial

cell lines containing activated HRAS21 (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 7k). Notably, the
RAS pathway is activated in ~50% of breast cancers22.

Author Manuscript

In this report, we have identified a new H2A ubiquitin ligase and shown how it functions in
conjunction with PRCs to silence target genes. In the canonical silencing pathway, PRC2
first interacts with the promoter, followed by EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 trimethylation, which
is recognized by PRC1 followed by RNF2-catalyzed H2A ubiquitination8,13. In cells
containing high TRIM37 levels, TRIM37 associates with PRC2 and the TRIM37-PRC2
complex targets specific promoters. The promoter-bound PRC2-TRIM37 complex then
carries out both H3K27 trimethyation and H2A mono-ubiquitination (see Extended Data
Fig. 8a). Our results show that in the absence of PRC2, TRIM37 can catalyze H2A monoubiquitination (Fig. 1a, b) and bind to DNA (Fig. 3c). However, it remains possible that
association with PRC2 could modulate, positively or negatively, the DNA-binding or H2A
mono-ubiquitination activity of TRIM37. TRIM37 is also required for PRC1 occupancy,
which presumably is mediated by PRC2 as in the canonical pathway. Although PRC1 does
not direct H2A ubiquitination it is still required for silencing, consistent with previous
studies showing that PRC1 mediates other repressive activities, such as chromatin
compaction23,24.

Author Manuscript

TRIM37 alters the specificity of PRC2 and thus when TRIM37 is over-expressed there are
extensive changes in gene expression that include the silencing of multiple tumour
suppressor genes. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that altered PRC2
activity, resulting, for example, from over-expression of EZH2, leads to malignancy25,26. In
support of our cell culture results, we found a correlation between increased TRIM37 levels
and decreased expression of TRIM37 target genes in human breast cancer samples (Fig. 4a
and Supplementary Table 5). Interestingly, there is also a statistically significant correlation
between high levels of TRIM37 and decreased survival in patients with estrogen-receptor
positive breast cancer (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Collectively, our results reveal TRIM37 as a
new H2A ubiquitin ligase that is over-expressed and promotes transformation in a subset of
breast cancers.

RNA interference

Author Manuscript

For stable shRNA knockdowns, cells were seeded in a six-well plate to 50% confluency and
subsequently transduced with 400 µl lentiviral particles expressing shRNAs (obtained from
Open Biosystems/Thermo Scientific through the UMMS RNAi Core Facility, listed in
Extended Data Table 1) in a total volume of 2 ml of appropriate media supplemented with 6
µg ml−1 polybrene. Media was replaced after overnight incubation to remove the polybrene
and viral particles and cells were subjected to puromycin selection (2 µg ml−1) for 3 days.
In vitro ubiquitination assays

Author Manuscript

To produce purified recombinant TRIM37, the TRIM37 open reading frame was PCR
amplified from a cDNA clone (Invitrogen) using high fidelity Pfu polymerase, and cloned
into a derivative of pEF6/V-5HisB (Invitrogen) resulting in the addition of a protein-C
epitope (MAEDQVDPRLIDGKEFT) at the N-terminus of TRIM37. The C18R mutation
was introduced by overlap extension PCR using primers listed in Extended Data Table 2. All
constructs were verified by sequencing.

Author Manuscript

In vitro ubiquitination reactions were set up containing purified TRIM37 or TRIM37-C18R
(500 ng–2 µg), a combination of BMI1 (500 ng; Abcam) and RNF2 (500 ng; Origene)
mixed together, or BRCA1 (500 ng; Abcam) plus H2A or H2B (5×, Boston Biochemicals),
10 nM UBE1 (E1; Boston Biochemicals), 10 nM UBCH5B (E2; Boston Biochemicals), and
10 nM HA-ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochemicals) in 10 µl of reaction buffer (50 mM
Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM NaF, 100 mM DTT and 2 mM ATP). Reactions were
incubated at 32°C for 90 min. For the nucleosomal assay, in vitro ubiquitination reactions
were set up similarly but contained Xenopus oocyte-derived nucleosomes; recombinant
histone particles were expressed and purified as described previously29 and reconstituted
using a standard salt step dialysis method30. To generate the H2A-KKRR mutant10, a pETbased plasmid expressing H2A (provided by Craig Peterson, University of Massachusetts
Medical School) was used as a template in a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with
primer extension reaction using primers listed in Extended Data Table 2. Proteins were
resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with H2A-ub(K119) (Cell
Signaling Technology #8240, clone D27C4), H2A (Cell Signaling Technology #2578),
H2B-ub (EMD Millipore 05-1312, clone 56), H2B (Abcam ab18977), H3 (Cell Signaling

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described previously6 using
primers listed in Extended Data Table 2. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH. NoRT controls were carried out in parallel to rule out the possibility of DNA contamination.
Each sample was analyzed three independent times and the results from one representative
experiment, with technical triplicates, are shown.
Immunoblotting

Author Manuscript

Nuclear lysates were prepared as previously described31. Nuclear extracts were separated on
either 8%, 10% or 20% SDS-PAGE gels. Blots were probed with primary antibodies (H2AUb[K119] [Cell Signaling Technology], H2A [Cell Signaling Technology], H2B-ub [EMD
Millipore], H2B [Cell Signaling Technology #12364, clone D2H6], H3 [Cell Signaling

overnight at 4°C, washed five times in TBS plus 0.1% Tween (TBST) and then incubated
with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were washed five times in TBST and visualized on autoradiography film after
incubating with ECL reagent (Supersignal West Pico or Supersignal West Femto; Thermo
Scientific). Immunoblots were quantified using Image J software version 1.47v (NIH).
TRIM37 over-expression

Author Manuscript

A TRIM37 cDNA clone (Origene Technologies) was subcloned into the vector p3X-FLAGMyc-CMV-26 (Sigma) using Not1 and Xba1 sites, and verified by full-length sequencing.
The TRIM37 expression vector was transfected into cells using Effectene reagent (Qiagen)
and stable clones were selected. Over-expression of TRIM37 was confirmed by
immunoblotting using TRIM37 (21st Century) and anti-FLAG (Sigma M2) antibodies.
ChIP-chip and directed chIP

Author Manuscript

For ChIP-chip analysis, chromatin was sonicated and immunoprecipitation was carried out
as previously described31 using a TRIM37 (Abcam), H2A-ub (Cell Signaling Technology),
EZH2 (Cell Signaling Technology #5246, clone D2C9), or H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling
Technology #9733, clone C36B11) antibody. Samples were prepared and hybridized to a
GeneChip Human Promoter 1.0R Array (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s
specifications, and arrays were scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
Each Chip-chip experiment was performed in duplicate. ChIP-chip data were analyzed using
Bioconductor package Starr32,33 for data read-in, normalizing and peak calling. Quantile
normalization was applied to normalize probe intensity before peak calling with default
settings except that fragment length (sonication fragment length) was set to 500, minrun
(minimum number of probes in a bound region) was set to 2, method (multiple test
adjustment method) was set to BH (Benjamini & Hochberg)34, and alpha (false discovery
rate cutoff) was set to 0.1. ChIP-chip results were annotated by R(v3.1.0)/

Bioconductor(v2.14) ChIPpeakAnno(v.2.12.1) package35. Density-plots were plotted by the
distance of peaks to the annotated transcription start site. Venn diagrams were drawn by
R(v3.1.0) Vennerable(v3.0) package. Gene ontology analysis was done by R/Bioconductor
package goProfiles36. For the statistical analysis on the global decrease in H3K27me3 and
H2A-ub following TRIM37 knockdown in MCF7 cells, the Wilcoxon Signed-rank test was
performed in R37. A summary table showing the overlap of proteins and epigenetic marks,
along with the P values for each overlap, is shown in Supplementary Table 6. CpG island
overlap analysis was performed as previously described17 except that CpG island annotation
was downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (https://www.genome.ucsc.edu). A CpG
gene list was generated for CpG islands located within 1 kb upstream of transcript start-site.
The percentage of promoters bound by EZH2 alone or co-bound by TRIM37 and EZH2 and
which also contain a CpG island was calculated by the intersection of the CpG gene list and
the EZH2 or EZH2/TRIM37 target gene list, respectively. The ChIP-chip data have been
deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus38 and are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE48196.

Author Manuscript

Directed ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously6 using cell extracts
prepared 7 days post-retroviral transduction and puromycin selection, and antibodies against
BMI1 (Abcam ab14389, clone 1.T.21), EZH2 (Cell Signaling Technology), H3K27me3
(Cell Signaling Technology), H2A-Ub (Cell Signaling Technology) and TRIM37 (Abcam)
or, as a negative control, IgG. The sequences of primers used for amplifying ChIP products
are listed in Extended Data Table 2. Based on the probe sequence used in the Affymetrix
array, for each gene a 400–600 bp region was tested for enrichment of TRIM37 using at
least three primer pairs. The primer pair with the consistently highest enrichment in three
different experiments was chosen for subsequent enrichment analysis of BMI1, H2A-ub,
H3K27me3 and EZH2. Each ChIP experiment was carried out three independent times and
the results from one representative experiment, with technical triplicates, are shown.
Identification of putative tumour suppressors
Candidate TRIM37 target genes were systematically queried against three databases: DNA
Tumor Suppressor and Oncogene Database (DTSOD; available at http://
embryology.med.unsw.edu.au.), TSGene Database (TSGene; http://
bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/TSGene/), and Tumor Associated Gene (TAG; http://
www.binfo.ncku.edu.tw/TAG/GeneDoc.php). Genes listed in the TSGene database or listed
as “tumor suppressor genes” in the DTSOD or TAG database were considered putative
tumour suppressor genes. Statistical enrichment of putative tumour suppressor genes among
TRIM37 target genes was calculated by a hypergeometric test.

Sucrose gradient fractionation
Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis was performed as described39. Briefly, 10–40%
gradients were formed by layering 500 µl NEB1 buffer containing 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40%
sucrose in a 11 × 34-mm centrifuge tube (Beckman) and allowed to equilibrate at room
temperature for 2 h. Gradients were chilled, loaded with 500 µg MCF7 nuclear extract
(adjusted to a volume of 150 µl) or 150 µl molecular weight markers (Sigma MW-GF-1000),
and centrifuged in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor at 50,000 rpm (214,000×g) for 14 h. Thirty-six

fractions of •45 µl were collected. For the markers, 20 µl of each fraction was
electrophoresed and Coomassie stained. For the gradient fractions, 20 µl of fractions were
analysed by immunoblotting using EZH2 (Cell Signaling Technology), SUZ12 (Abcam
ab12073), TRIM37 (Abcam), RNF2 (Abcam ab101273) and BMI1 (Bethyl Laboratories,
A301-694A).
Co-immunprecipitation

Author Manuscript

MCF7 nuclear extract (~1000 µg) was incubated with a TRIM37 (Abcam), EZH2 (Cell
Signaling Technology) or SUZ12 (Abcam) antibody at 4°C for 24 h in the presence or
absence of ethidium bromide (100 µg ml−1). For immunoprecipitations from fractionated
nuclear lysate, fractions 20–22 (which were enriched for TRIM37, EZH2 and SUZ12) were
pooled and diluted 15-fold. Immune complexes were captured on rabbit or mouse TrueBlot
IP beads (eBioScience), washed three times in NEB1 buffer, and eluted by boiling 10 min in
2× SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitations from MCF7 cells ectopically expressing
FLAG-tagged TRIM37 were performed similarly, except anti-FLAG magnetic beads
(Sigma) were used to capture the immune complexes. Immunoprecipitated proteins were
analysed by immunoblotting as described above. Input lanes represent 10–25% of extract

Large-scale immune-precipitation was carried out as previously described40 by incubating
80 mg MCF7 nuclear extract with 50 µg of anti-TRIM37 antibody (Abcam) at 4°C for 5 h.
Immune complex were captured on IgG Dynabeads (Life Technologies) by additional
incubation at 4°C for 2 h. The beads were then washed with NETN [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40] three times and re-suspended in Laemmli
buffer. Proteins were separated on a short 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A 2 cm gel slice
with all the proteins was submitted for mass spectrometry at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility.

For in gel digestion, gel slices were placed in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of water for
30 min and then replaced with 100 µl of 250 mM ammonium bicarbonate. For reduction, 20
µl of a 45 mM 1, 4 dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and the samples were incubated fat 50°C
for 30 min. The alkylation was carried out by addition of 20 µl of a 100 mM iodoacetamide
solution for 30 min. The gel slices were washed twice with water and then treated with
50:50 (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate: acetonitrile) for 1 h. The solution was then removed
and 200 µl of acetonitrile was added. Dried gel slices were rehydrated in 50 µl of 2 ng µl−1
trypsin (Sigma) in 0.01% ProteaseMAX Surfactant (Promega): 50mM ammonium
bicarbonate at 37°C for 21 h. Additional dehydration was carried out with 100 µl of 80:20
(acetonitrile: 1% formic acid). Dried samples were resuspended in 25 µl of 5% acetonitrile
in 0.1% trifluroacetic acid prior to injection on LC/MS/MS.
Briefly, samples were injected onto a custom packed 2cm × 100 µm C18 Magic 5µ particle
trap column. Labeled peptides were then eluted and sprayed from a custom packed emitter
(75 µm × 25 cm C18 Magic 3µm particle) with a linear gradient from 95% solvent A (0.1%

acquisitions were performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Raw
data files were processed with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.3) prior to searching with
Mascot Server (version 2.4) against the Human Index of the SwissProt database. Search
parameters utilized were fully tryptic with 2 missed cleavages, parent mass tolerances of 10
ppm and fragment mass tolerances of 0.05 Da. A fixed modification of carbamidomethyl
cysteine and variable modifications of acetyl (protein N-term), pyro glutamic for N-term
glutamine, oxidation of methionine was considered. Search results were loaded into the
Scaffold Viewer (Proteome Software, Inc.), which provided total spectra scores and
interaction probabilities.
GST pull-down assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The TRIM37 cDNA (Origene Technologies) was cloned into the vector pGEX4T-1 (Life
Technologies) using EcoR1 and NotI sites and the construct was verified by full-length
sequencing. Supernatant from bacteria expressing GST-TRIM37 was incubated with
glutathione agarose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4°C for 3–4 h. Beads were washed thrice with
PBS and 0.5% Triton X-100 before using in pull-down assays. PRC2 subunits (EZH2
[Origene Technologies], SUZ12 [Origene Technologies], AEBP2 [Open Biosystems], EED
[Open Biosystems] and RBAP48 [Open Biosystems]) were in vitro translated using the
TnT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s specifications. GST-TRIM37 beads (3 µg) were incubated with in vitro
translated protein (added to 1/10 volume of the reaction mixture) in Buffer A (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, 150 mM KCl and
0.05% NP40) at 4°C for 2 h. Following incubation, beads were washed twice with wash
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol,
300 mM KCl and 0.05% NP40). The interaction was detected by immune-blot using a biotin
antibody (Abcam #53494).
GAL4-TRIM37 recruitment assay
The TRIM37 cDNA was cloned into the plasmid pCMX-Gal4 (Addgene), which contains
amino acids 1–147 of GAL4, using KpnI and Nhe1 sites. TRIM37 deletions were generated
using PCR-based site-directed deletion with primer extension using primers listed in
Extended Data Table 2. All constructs were verified by full-length sequencing. 293T cells
were co-transfected with the GAL4-TRIM37 plasmid and G5E1bcat-pSP7241 (containing
five GAL4-binding sites) or E1bcat-pSP7242 (negative control). ChIP assays were carried
out as described above.

Breast cancer biostatistical analysis
Gene expression and CpG methylation data from breast cancer samples (n=466) were
obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/
publications/brca_2012/)19. The mRNA data was converted to relative mRNA expression
levels by subtracting each gene's median level computed over 22 tumour-adjacent normal
controls from its level observed in each patient sample. A subset of samples was then
selected for further analysis to include those with upregulated TRIM37 (n=45 with TRIM37
value ≥1) and downregulated TRIM37 (n=26 with TRIM37 value ≤−1). Pearson correlation

analysis was performed to identify TRIM37 target genes (identified in the ChIP-chip
experiment) whose down-regulation significantly correlated with increased TRIM37
expression (P <0.01). Statistical analysis and plotting were done with R(v3.1.0), a system
for statistical computation and graphics37. The top 60 genes with negative correlation to
TRIM37 were extracted for heat map plots using R(v3.1.0) pheatmap(v0.7.7) package.
Cancer subtypes were extracted from sample list information of gene expression data (level
3, PAM50). Cancer stages were extracted from TCGA clinical information.

TRIM37/17q23 copy number data were also downloaded from https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
docs/publications/brca_2012/, Section "SNP and Copy Number" Level3 Data Archives.
Data were visualized using R/Bioconductor package Gviz and analysed as described
previously19. Briefly, thresholded gene level copy number values were calculated using
GISTIC 2.0 and Log2 copy number values were thresholded as followed: values <−1 are set
to −2, values between −1 and −0.3 are set to −1, values between −0.3 and 0.3 are set to 0,
values between −1 and −0.3 are set to 1, and values > 1 are set to 2. Tumours where all gene
level thresholded copy number changes equaled 0 were excluded from the analysis.
For correlation analysis between TRIM37 and prognosis, Kaplan-Meier plotting and logrank
test were done at http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast. Analysis
was restricted to breast cancer patients with ER-positive subtypes. Patients were divided into
two classes based on TRIM37 expression: patients with higher than upper quartile TRIM37
expression were considered as high-expressing TRIM37 group (n=352) and the other
patients were considered as low-expressing TRIM37 group (n = 1061).
Animal experiments

Author Manuscript

All animal protocols were approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee at
UMMS (A-2016). Animal sample sizes were selected based on precedent established from
previous publications and an understanding that at least n=5 is generally required to achieve
statistical significance. For mouse experiments involving shRNAs, the most efficacious
shRNA of multiple shRNAs tested and validated in cell culture was used, a criterion that
was established prospectively. Mice were randomly allocated to each group. No blinding
was done as animal groups were identified by tagging and labeling the cages with the cells
injected. Animals were excluded, according to pre-established criteria, if the tumour volume
reached >2000mm3; if tumour size or location affected the mobility or general health of
animal, the animal was euthanized and excluded from the experiment or the complete
experiment was terminated.

MCF7 (1×106), BT474 (3×106) or FC-IBC02 (3×106) cells stably expressing a nonsilencing (NS) or TRIM37 shRNA were injected into the right thoracic mammary fat pad
(MCF7) or flank (BT474 and FC-IBC02) of 6–8 week old BALB/c nu/nu female mice (n=3;
Taconic Farms) to produce orthotopic primary tumours. Because MCF7, BT474 and FCIBC02 cells are hormone dependent, a 60 day release tablet of 1.7 mg estradiol (Innovative
Research of America) was implemented under the skin of the neck of the mouse with 11gauge trochar. Primary tumour growth was evaluated by measurement with calipers. NIH
3T3 (5×106), MCF10AT (3×106), HMLER (3×106) or BPLER (3×106) cells expressing
vector or TRIM37 or TRIM37-C18R were subcutaneously injected in the flank of the mice

(n=3) and the growth of the primary tumours was monitored as previously described6.
MCF10AT (5×106) cells expressing a NS shRNA or shRNA targeting a tumour suppressor
gene were subcutaneously injected in the flank of the mice (n=3) and tumour growth was
monitored. All mouse experiments were repeated at least twice (for a total of at least 6 mice
per group).
Soft agar assay

Author Manuscript

MCF10AT cells (2.5×104) expressing vector or TRIM37, or MCF10AT cells expressing a
NS shRNA or shRNA targeting a tumour suppressor gene, were re-suspended in 3 ml of top
agar (MCF10AT media containing 0.3% Difco Noble agar (BD Biosciences)) warmed to
40°C. The cell suspension was layered onto 3 ml of set bottom agar (MCF10AT media
containing 0.7% Noble agar) in a 6-well plate. Two milliliter of medium was added on the
top agar next day and changed every other day. Visible colonies were scored after 4–5
weeks.
Statistics
To achieve statistical significance, all qRT-PCR and ChIP data were collected from
experiments performed in technical triplicate; each experiment was repeated at least twice
and statistically significant results were obtained in independent biological replicates.
Differences between groups were assayed using a two-tailed student t-test using Microsoft
Excel. In cases where the assumption of the t-test was not valid a non-parametric statistical
method was used (e.g., Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Significant differences were considered
when P<0.05; *P≤0.05 and **P≤0.01. The error bars indicate the standard deviation or
standard error of the mean for the technical replicates, as indicated in the legend.
