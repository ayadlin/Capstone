ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess many characteristics associated with stem cells
and are believed to drive tumor initiation. Although targeting of CSCs offers great
promise for the new generation of therapeutics, lack of the effective drugable target
and appropriate pharmacological reagents significantly impedes the development of
chemotherapies. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of BMK1 was significantly
correlated with not only embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, but also
the CSCs. It was showed that activation of BMK1 by the expression of MEK5D enhanced
the self-renew (sphere formation), proliferation (clone formation) and tumorigenic
capacity of CSCs. While BMK1 inhibitor, XMD8-92, suppressed these capacities. RNAseq and microarray analysis revealed that inhibition of BMK1 significantly enhanced
the expression of BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which play important roles in cell death. Further
study indicated that shRNA-mediated knock down of BNIP3 and BNIP3L impairs
the BMK1 inhibitor, XMD8-92-induced suppression of sphere formation and clone
formation of CSC. Collectively, these results not only indicate that BMK1 plays an
important role in maintaining “stemness” of CSCs, but also implicate that BMK1 might
be a potential drug target for CSCs.

It is well known that the mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinase signaling pathways play a central role
in the decision of cell fate. In mammalian, four MAPK
pathways have been discovered and are known as
ERK1/2, BMK1 (also called MAPK7 or ERK5), p38 and
JNKs pathways [3]. Generally, ERK1/2 and BMK1 are
activated by oncogenic signals and involved in promoting
cell proliferation and survival; while JNK and p38 are
supposed to regulate cell death and proliferation [3, 4].
Although BMK1 is the most closely related to ERK1/2 [5],
it seems that ERK5 and ERK1/2 pathways play opposing
regulatory roles in stem and progenitor cells [6]. At the
meantime, our previous study has showed that deletion of

INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSCs), as a small fraction
of cancer cell population, have been supposed to play
key roles in tumor initiation, treatment resistance and
recurrence [1, 2]. Therefore, development of specific
therapies targeting CSCs is promising for improvement
of cancer therapeutics. However, conventional cancer
therapeutics tend to preferentially eliminate the non-CSCs,
leaving behind residues of CSCs, which can subsequently
result in recurrence. Hence, the identification of key CSC
pathways and development of appropriate inhibitor are
critical for CSC-targeted therapy.

BMK1 results in embryonic lethal, which also suggested
that BMK1 might play an important role in maintaining
“stemness” [7]. Moreover, deregulated BMK1 signaling
has so far been correlated with general properties of human
malignancies, including tumorigenesis, chemoresistance
[8], proliferation [9] and metastatic potential [10], which
are also the capacities of CSCs.
Here, we demonstrated that BMK1 was activated in
not only embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells, but also the tumor sphere-enriched CSCs. It was
also showed that the phosphorylation of BMK1 by the
expression of MEK5D enhanced the sphere formation,
clone formation and tumor-initiating capacity (TIC) of
CSCs, while the inhibition of BMK1 can abolish these
capacities.

(Figure 1H), which reinforced the important role of BMK1
in tumorigenicity. Collectively, these data indicated that
phospho-BMK1 was significantly correlated with the
stemness and tumorigenicity of CSCs.

Inhibition of BMK1 effectively suppressed the
self-renew and proliferation of cancer stem cells
To investigate the role of BMK1 in CSCs, sphere and
colony formation was carried out to evaluate the self-renew
and proliferation of CSCs, respectively (Figure 2A) [11, 13].
For sphere formation assay, tumor cells were cultured in stem
cell medium containing DMEM/F12, B27, EGF and bFGF
as previously described [13]. After 10 days, sphere cells were
plated in basic medium (DMEM contained 10% FBS). As
shown in Figure 2B and Figure 2C, XMD8-92 treatment
significantly inhibited the sphere formation of U87MG and
A549 cells. Similarly, XMD8-92 treatment also significantly
impaired the colony formation of U87MG and A549 cells as
shown in Figure 2D and Figure 2E. To confirm this, BMK1
was also knocked down in both A549 and U87MG cells
using two shRNAs (Figure 2F). The resultant control and
shBMK1 cells were treated with/without XMD8-92 as noted.
Compared with the control cells, shBMK1 U87MG and
A549 cells show reduction of sphere formation (Figure 2G)
and colony formation (Figure 2H), which also argued that
inhibition of BMK1 effectively suppressed both self-renew
and proliferation of cancer stem cells.

RESULTS
Phospho-BMK1 was correlated with iPS,
embryonic and cancer stem cells
Considering that CSCs share a lot of characteristics
associated with normal stem cells, it followed logically
to investigate the oncogenic pathway, which also plays
critical role in stem cells. As described above, previous
studies have suggested that BMK1 might play a critical
role in maintaining “stemness” of stem and progenitor
cells (Figure 1A). To test this, the phospho-BMK1 was
evaluated in iPS and whole embryonic (E10.5 and 15.5)
cells. As expected, it was found that phospho-BMK1 was
significantly elevated in iPS and embryonic stem cells
compared with A549 and U87MG cells, most of which
are supposed to be non-CSCs (Figure 1B). In our previous
study, it has been described that a small-molecule inhibitor
of BMK1, XMD8-92 (Figure 1C), can inhibit BMK1
and impair the tumorigenesis (Figure 1D). Using this
BMK1 inhibitor, it was found that inhibition of BMK1
impaired the self-renew of iPS cells (Supplementary
Figure S1A) and resulted in embryo lethal (Supplementary
Figure S1B). These data indicated that BMK1 might
increase “stemness”. Based on these, the phosphorylation
of BMK1 was evaluated in tumor spheres, which were
supposed to enrich the CSCs or even taken as the CSCs
[11]. It was found that the phosphorylation of BMK1 was
significantly enhanced in tumor sphere cells compared
with monolayer cells (Figure 1E), while BMK1 inhibitor
XMD8-92 blocked this phosphorylation of BMK1 as
expected (Figure 1F). To confirm the correlation of
phospho-BMK1 with tumorigenicity, an A549 xenograft
model was built to evaluate the phosphorylation of BMK1
as previously described [12]. Briefly, monolayer and sphere
A549 cells were injected subcutaneously into mice and
treated with/without XMD8-92, respectively (Figure 1G).
The resultant tumors from both monolayer and sphere
A549 cells showed upregulation of phospho-BMK1

Phosphorylation of BMK1 promoted the
proliferation, selfrenewal, and tumorigenicity
of cancer stem cells
To further confirm the role of BMK1 in CSCs, a
constitutively active mutant of MEK5, MEK5D, was
used to phosphorylate BMK1 (Figure 3A) as described
in our previous study [4]. As showed in Figure 3A, stable
expression of MEK5D enhanced the phosphorylation of
BMK1 in U87MG and A549 cells. The resultant stable
MEK5D-expressed U87MG and A549 cell lines were used
for sphere and colony formation assay with/without XMD892 treatment. As expected, expression of MEK5D promoted
both sphere and colony formation, which were notablely
inhibited by XMD8-92 or shBMK1 (shBMK1-1) (Figure 3B
and 3C). Furthermore, an A549 xenograft model was built
to evaluate the role of BMK1 in tumorigenicity as described
in Figure 3D [12]. Briefly, different amount of monolayer
and sphere cells from Ctrl (vector) and MEK5D A549 lines
were injected subcutaneously into mice. These tumorbearing mice were randomized into groups and treated
with/without XMD8-92 twice a day as noted. Consistent
with the in vitro data, analysis of Ctrl and MEK5D A549
xenografts with/without XMD8-92 treatment showed that
MEK5D significantly promoted the tumorigenicity, which
was impaired by XMD8-92 (Figure 3E and 3F) or shBMK1

these data indicated that phosphorylation of BMK1
promotes the proliferation, selfrenewal, and tumorigenicity
of cancer stem cells.

recurrence of cancer. Development of specific therapies
targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival
of cancer patients. Therefore, elucidation of the pathways
that regulate the maintenance and survival of CSCs is
important for the development of novel therapies.
In many kinds of cancer, it has be reported
that deregulated BMK1 signaling is correlated with
general capacities of CSCs, including tumorigenesis,
chemoresistance [8], proliferation [9] and metastatic
potential [10]. Traditional deletion of BMK1 results in
embryonic lethal, which reinforces the potential important
role of BMK1 in stem cells. At the mean time, conditional
knockout of BMK1 in various tissues (such as neurons,
hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and T and B cells) has no
obvious effect on the development, behavior, reproduction
and aging of the mouse [7], suggesting that BMK1 might
be a potential drug target for CSC-targeted therapy.
In this study, it was described that the phosphoBMK1 was significantly enhanced in not only embryonic
and iPS cells as expected, but also the CSCs. It was
showed that activation of BMK1 enhanced the sphere
formation (self-renew), clone formation (proliferation) and
tumor-initiating capacity (TIC) of CSCs, while inhibition
of BMK1 impaired these capacities. Moreover, it was
found that inhibition of BMK1 significantly enhanced
BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which play critical roles in cell
death. And this enhancement of BNIP3 and BNIP3L is
through HIF1α. Further study showed that knock down
of BNIP3 and BNIP3L hampered the XMD8-92-induced
suppression of sphere formation and clone formation of
CSC. Therefore, inhibition of BMK1 pathway suppressed
cancer stem cells through BNIP3 and BNIP3L.
BNIP3 and BNIP3L are related to the BH3-only
family and promote both cell death and autophagy
[14]. Consistent with their ability to induce cell death,
BNIP3 and BNIP3L inhibit tumor growth especially in
hypoxia conditions. Previous studies have indicated that
hypermethylation of the BNIP3 promoter was found
in pancreatic cancer [18], and the BNIP3L gene was
infrequently mutated in a panel of primary breast and
ovarian tumors [19]. Since BNIP3 and BNIP3L promote
cell death, it is not surprising that upregulation of BNIP3
and BNIP3L were reported to block cancer stem cells in
multi types of cancer [20]. However, an intriguing aspect
of the biology of BNIP3 and BNIP3L is their role in
autophagy, apart from the role in cell death. Despite the
controversy, which still exists regarding the characteristics
of CSCs, a correlation between autophagy and CSCs has
been suggested. Autophagy has been shown to be involved
in the maintenance of CSCs in various tumors, such as
breast cancer [21] and pancreatic cancer [22]. Therefore,
BNIP3 and BNIP3L exhibit a dual nature—they promote
both cell death and autophagy, which has a protective effect
in some settings. This dual nature effects were also observed
in HIF1, the well known upstream of BNIP3 and BNIP3L.

Inhibition of BMK1 pathway suppressed the
stemness of cancer stem cells through BNIP3
and BNIP3L
To uncover the mechanisms of BMK1-mediated
enhancement of CSCs, we used both RNA-seq and
microarray to identify the genes whose expression
was changed after XMD8-29 treatment (Figure 4A).
A549 sphere cells treated with/without XMD8-92 were
analyzed by RNA-seq, while both monolayer and sphere
cells treated with/without XMD8-92 were analyzed by
microarray. Further studies of subcellular localization
(Figure 4B), molecular function (Figure 4C), biological
process (Figure 4D) and pathway analysis (Figure 4E)
indicated that inhibition of BMK1 led to enhance the
expression of cell death-associated genes (including BNIP3
and BNIP3L). Furthermore, 40 genes, which showed the
significant alteration in both RNA-seq and microarray,
were knocked down in A549 cells using shRNAi. Then the
resultant shRNA A549 cell lines were used for the XMD892-induced suppression assay (Figure 4F). It was found
that shBNIP3 and shBNIP3L significantly blocked XMD892-induced suppression of sphere formation (Figure 4F).
As expected, further study indicated that BMK1
inhibitor XMD8-92 significantly enhanced BNIP3
(Figure 5A) and BNIP3L (Figure 5B) in A549 sphere cells.
Considering both BNIP3 and BNIP3L were the downstream
of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) [14], the role of
BMK1 in the regulation of HIF1α was investigated in A549
sphere cells. Treatment of A549 sphere cells with BMK1
inhibitor for 4 hrs significantly increased HIF1α, which
suggested that inhibition of BMK1 was able to stabilize
HIF1α (Figure  5C). Further study indicated that shRNA
knockdown of HIF1α significantly impaired the upregulation
of BNIP3 and BNIP3L, which was induced by BMK1
inhibitor (Figure 5D) or shRNA knockdown (Figure 5E).
At the meantime, double knockdown of BNIP3 and
BNIP3L (Figure 5F) notablely blocked XMD8-92-induced
suppression of sphere and colony formation of CSCs (Figure
5G and 5H). Most importantly, it was also found that double
knockdown of BNIP3 and BNIP3L significantly impaired
XMD8-92-induced apoptosis of A549 CSCs (Figure 5I).
Taken together, these experiments provide the evidence of
feasibility for BMK1 inhibition in the setting of cancer stem
cells through BNIP3 and BNIP3L.

DISCUSSION
Despite of their small quantity, CSCs are proposed
to play a crucial role in the initiation, progression and

As one of the most famous and well studied
transcription factors, HIF1 plays a central role in
the cellular response to hypoxia. HIF1 regulates the
transcription of a broad range of genes that facilitate
responses to the hypoxic environment, including genes
regulating angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, cell cycle,
metabolism and cell death [23]. The HIF1 heterodimeric
complex consists of two subunits, HIF1A and HIF1B.
Under normoxic conditions, two critical prolines in HIF1A
(Pro564 and Pro402) can be hydroxylated by proline
hydroxylase (PHD). Hydroxylation of HIF-1A leads to a
conformational change that promotes binding to VLH (von
Hippel Lindau protein) and ubiquitin mediated degradation
[23]. Although many studies have indicated that moderate
HIF1A and hypoxia has been heavily implicated in stem
cells and CSCs [24, 25], HIF1A and hypoxia are also
well known to promote cell death through at least two
mechanisms [26]. First, some HIF1A targets are genes
capable of inducing cell death, including RPT801 [27],
BNIP3 [14, 28] and BNIP3L [14] as described above.
Second, HIF1A-induced cell death may be stemmed from
the cooperation between the hypoxia pathway and p53
pathway [29, 30], both of which are significantly regulated
by BMK1 [17, 31]. In fact, many studies have indicated
that HIF1A functions as a tumor suppressor instead
of a tumor promoter in many cancers [29, 32]. Hence,
this double-edged sword of HIF1A should be carefully
manipulated in cancer therapies. Interestingly, although
inhibition of BMK1 enhanced HIF1A as described above,
knockout of BMK1 impairs angiogenesis and results in
vascular collapse [7]. We hypothesize that this might due
to the cooperation between BMK1\P53 pathway [17, 31]
and BNIP3 (and/or BNIP3L) pathway. But more work is
still needed.
Collectively, this study strengthened the notion that
BMK1 plays an important role in CSCs, and blocking the
BMK1 pathway may be an effective approach for targeting
CSCs.

(DMEM) (basic medium), which contained 10% heatinactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin
and streptomycin at 37°C under a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 for 18 hrs. Thereafter, cells were cultured in
stem cell medium containing DMEM/F12 (Gibco, USA),
B27 (1x, Gibco), recombinant human epidermal growth
factor (rhEGF, 20 ng/ml; Sigma, USA) and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml; Upstate, USA).

100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C under a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 10 days, the cells
were incubated in 0.5 ml MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo
(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide) solution (final
concentration: 0.5 mg/ml) for 3 hrs. Then the medium was
replaced by 0.2 ml DMSO. The plates were agitated for
15 min and the optical density of the solution in the wells

Control and shBNIP3/shBNIP3L A549 sphere
cells were treated with/without 4 μmol/L XMD892 for 36 hrs, and collected by trypsinization and
centrifugation at 300 G for 5 mins. The resultant cells
were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in
100 μL Annexin-binding buffer. Then Annexin V (final
concentration: 1 μg/ml) and PI (final concentration:
30 μg/ml) were added into 100  μL cell suspension.
Then cells were incubated at room temperature for 15
minutes. The fluorescence intensity was detected with
the flow cytometry.

pathway: lessons from knockout mice. J Mol Med. 2004;
82:800–808.

The following animal-handling procedures were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
DaLian Medical University. Xenograft models were built
as described in the previous study [12]. Briefly, cells as
indicated were injected subcutaneously into the right/
left flank of 6-week-old NOD/SCID mice. These tumorbearing mice were randomized into groups and treated
W/O XMD8-92 (50 mg/kg) IP twice a day as indicated.
Tumor size was measured by caliper and tumor volume
was calculated by using the formula: 0.52 ´ L ´ W2,
where L was the longest diameter and W was the shortest
diameter.
