BACKGROUND. The antiepileptic agent, gabapentin, has been demonstrated to
relieve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy due to various etiologies. On the basis of these data, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of gabapentin on symptoms
of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

METHODS. Patients with symptomatic CIPN who complained of ‘average’ daily
pain scores of either 1) 4 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS); or 2) 1 on
the 0–3 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group neuropathy scale (ENS) were eligible (higher numbers indicate greater severity of symptoms in both scales).
Patients were randomized to receive gabapentin (target dose, 2700 mg) or placebo for 6 weeks. Crossover occurred after a 2-week washout period. CIPNrelated symptoms were evaluated weekly by questionnaires. Statistical methods
followed established methods for crossover designs, including Student t tests to

and docetaxel), platinum-based compounds (carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin), and vinca alkaloids
(vincristine and vinblastine). Because these agents
are used to treat several prevalent cancers, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is
common in patients treated with chemotherapy.1–3
CIPN is manifested by the development of paresthesias, dysesthesias, loss of joint and vibration sense,
and loss of deep tendon reflexes. The onset of symptomatic CIPN usually leads to reductions in dose(s)
and/or interruptions of therapy, which can negatively
impact cancer-related outcomes.
There are few effective pharmacological options
to treat symptoms due to CIPN. Analgesics (ie,
opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents)
are only modestly effective in treating symptoms
from neuropathy. Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline and amitriptyline) have been suggested as
therapeutic options for neuropathy; however, there
are few data to support their use in CIPN. One randomized trial evaluated nortriptyline for therapy of
CIPN symptoms; this agent was found to be ineffective.4 The identification of alternate treatment strategies would be a welcome development for patients
afflicted with CIPN.
Gabapentin, an antiepileptic drug that is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), has been shown to be
effective in treating symptoms from several neuropathic syndromes. Neuronal excitability that occurs
after nerve injury is presumed to be mediated (at
least in part) by up-regulation of the a2d1 subunit
of the voltage-dependent calcium channels in the
dorsal nerve root ganglia.5 Gabapentin inhibits the
a2d1 subunit, reducing calcium influx and neurotransmitter release from hyperexcited neurons, and
thus provides the theoretical basis for reducing
nociception in neuropathic syndromes in animal
models.5–7 Gabapentin use results in few adverse
effects, which makes it an attractive adjunctive analgesic agent.
Gabapentin has been evaluated in numerous
clinical trials for its benefits in relieving symptoms of
neuropathy. These trials have demonstrated a benefit
to using gabapentin to treat symptoms of neuropathy
caused by a variety of etiologies, including diabetes,8,9 postherpetic neuralgia,10,11 tumor infiltration,12,13 and postamputation phantom pain syndromes.14 At the time this study was designed,
preliminary data available from 1 trial (available in
an abstract form) suggested that gabapentin was
effective in reducing symptoms from oxaliplatininduced neuropathy.15 Based on these preliminary
data, this prospective, randomized, double-blinded,

2111

placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was
designed to test the hypothesis that gabapentin
could improve pain and other neuropathy symptoms
in patients with CIPN.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was conducted after appropriate approval
by individual institutional review boards of the treating sites of the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients.

Patient Characteristics
Adult patients with duration > 1 month symptomatic
CIPN due to neurotoxic chemotherapy (ie, taxanespaclitaxel or docetaxel; platinum compounds-carboplatin or cisplatin or oxaliplatin; vinca alkaloids-vincristine or vinblastine) were eligible. Patients who
were currently receiving chemotherapy, as well as
those who had completed therapy at the time of
study entry, were eligible. Symptom severity for ‘average’ pain required for study entry were either 1) a
rating of 4 on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS;
0 5 no pain and 10 5 worst pain possible), or 2) a
score 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
neuropathy scale (ENS; 0 5 none; 1 5 mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes; 2 5 mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias;
3 5 severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that
interfere with function). Serum creatinine 1.5 times
the upper limit of normal and an estimated life expectancy of 6 months were required. Patients who
had pre-existing symptomatic neuropathy due to
other causes (eg, radiation or malignant plexopathy,
lumbar or cervical radiculopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, or diabetes) or were pregnant or lactating
were ineligible. Patients who were using the following
agents at baseline were ineligible: antidepressants,
opioids, adjuvant analgesic agents (eg, anticonvulsants, clonazepam, or mexiletine), topical analgesics,
and amifostine (although therapy with any of these
agents could be initiated after study entry if necessary). The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agents (NSAIDs) was permitted.
Study Design
This study used a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design consisting of two 6-week
phases separated by a 2-week ‘‘washout’’ period. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2
arms, either gabapentin followed by placebo (hereby
designated G/P) or the reverse order (designated P/
G). Before their randomization, patients were strati-

fied by the type of neurotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents used (vinca alkaloids vs taxanes vs platinumbased compounds vs combination, ie, 2 or more of
the previously mentioned agents) and by whether
they were enrolled during ongoing chemotherapy or
had completed their therapy. The randomization was
performed by using a dynamic allocation procedure
that balanced marginal distributions of stratification
factors between treatment groups.16 Titration schedules and the duration of the washout period were
designed based on the short half-life of gabapentin
(5–7 hours). Doses of gabapentin (300 mg capsules)
and identical placebo capsules were incrementally
escalated over 3 weeks to a target dose of 9 capsules
a day (ie, 2700 mg of gabapentin) regardless of efficacy noted at lower doses. This target dose was chosen on the basis of previous trials that had suggested
efficacy and tolerability of comparable doses of gabapentin when used to treat symptomatic neuropathy.8,11 If toxic events occurred, the dose was
reduced to a previously well-tolerated dose level. After treatment with the maximal dose for 3 weeks,
patients were weaned from the drug, after which
they were crossed over to the opposite arm and treated in an identical manner.

‘minimally worse’, ‘moderately worse’, or ‘much
worse’)23; 5) the Symptom Distress Scale (a 5-point
scale that evaluates a range of symptoms commonly
encountered by cancer patients)24; 6) the Profile of
Mood States (POMS) Short Form (a 30-item scale to
assess mood states)25; and 7) a quality-of-life (QOL)
Uniscale (a single-item measurement of global QOL
on a numeric analog scale from 0 to 100).26 These
secondary measures were evaluated at baseline and
at the end of 6, 8, and 14 weeks. Compliance and
adverse events were assessed by weekly phone calls
by a member of the research team. All administered
ancillary treatments were recorded weekly.

Assessment Tools
The primary efficacy measure was the patientreported ‘average’ pain over a particular day, as
measured by using the NRS17,18 and ENS.19 These
primary outcomes as well as adverse events were
assessed weekly. Patients were asked to assign a
score on each scale for their ‘worst’ and ‘least’ pain
experiences on the day of evaluation. Because CIPN
results in a spectrum of symptoms (several of which
are related to, but are distinct from, pain), several
additional secondary measures were used to evaluate
changes in these symptoms. These secondary efficacy measures included 1) the World Health Organization (WHO) classification scale for neuropathyrelated symptoms (0–4; 0 5 none; 1 5 paresthesias
and/or decreased tendon reflexes; 2 5 severe paresthesias and/or mild weakness; 3 5 intolerable paresthesias and/or marked motor loss; 4 5 paralysis)20;
2) the Short Form–McGill Pain Questionnaire
(assesses different characteristics of neuropathic pain
such as throbbing, gnawing, shooting, aching, and
burning)21; 3) the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form
(BPI; assesses pain and its effects on ability to function)22; 4) the Subjective Global Impression of
Change (SGI; a 7-point scale that rates change in
overall status of symptoms since the beginning of
the study with choices of ‘much improved’, ‘moderately improved’, ‘minimally improved’, ‘no change’,

Statistical Considerations
This study was designed to have 50 patients in each
arm to provide 80% power to detect differences in
‘average’ pain scores of 0.63 standard deviations via a
standard 2-sample Student t test, by using a 2-sided
type I error rate of 2.5% to account for the presence
of 2 primary endpoints via a Bonferroni correction.
Decisions pertinent to efficacy were made on the basis of these statistical comparisons for the first 6week phase of the study; additional comparisons
were made after taking into consideration results of
the crossover phase. Analytical procedures compiled
into a specialized computer algorithm by the Mayo
Clinic Cancer Center Statistics Unit for use in crossover studies were used.27 The scores for ‘average’
pain for each of the primary endpoint variables were
calculated for each treatment period for input into a
classic crossover ‘‘sums and differences’’ analysis.28
Two-sample Student t tests and/or Wilcoxon ranksum tests were employed, depending upon the measurement level and normality of data. Wilcoxon and
Fisher exact tests were used to test the equality of
pain distributions across the 2 study groups. All
treatment comparisons used 2-sided testing and a
5% type I error rate, unless otherwise specified. Analyses for secondary endpoints were identical to those
of the primary endpoint by crossover trial analytical
methodology. Missing data were handled in a

RESULTS
Between March 2002 and December 2003, 115
patients that had met study-entry criteria were randomized. The accrual exceeded the target by 15, as
these patients had already initiated the process of
registering for this trial at the time the study formally
closed. The schema is depicted in Figure 1, and a
Consort (Consolidated Standard for Reporting Clinical Trials) diagram is presented in Figure 2. A total of
57 and 58 patients were enrolled into the G/P arm
and the P/G arm, respectively. Patients in each arm
were well balanced by demographic factors, chemotherapy drugs responsible for CIPN, and severity of
outcome measures (Table 1). The NRS scores for ‘average’ daily pain at baseline were 4.3 and 3.6
(P 5 .06) in the G/P and P/G arms, respectively.
Patients were eligible to enroll when they met symptom severity criteria for either the ESN or the NRS
(but did not need to fulfill both criteria), hence a few

(listed in the study-design section), had a statistically
different response to the study drug when compared
with placebo. Likewise, the subset of patients who
had higher (ie, more severe) pain scores at baseline
did not appear to have a preferential benefit with
gabapentin therapy, when compared with those with
lower baseline pain scores. These results are depicted
in Table 2 and Figure 3. The changes in the symptom
scores in the first 6-week period (expressed as a percentage of baseline) are depicted in Figure 4.
Therapy for the 14-week duration of the trial was
administered to 61% and 60% of patients enrolled in
the G/P and P/G arms, respectively. In patients who
discontinued therapy, the reasons for stopping therapy
were given as ‘refusal’ (presumably because of perceived lack of activity) in 20% and in 29% of those who
received gabapentin and placebo, respectively, at the
time of discontinuation. Other reasons for stopping
therapy were disease progression, death (due to the
cancer), and decision to switch to alternative therapies. Regarding reasons given to study personnel for
stopping therapy, there were no statistically significant
differences between patients on placebo or patients
on gabapentin. All available data from patients who
stopped therapy were included in analyses.
Overall, CIPN scores improved for all patients
during the trial, compared with their scores at baseline (irrespective of treatment assigned). The NRS
score for ‘average’ pain improved by 0.12 unit per
week in all enrolled patients (P 5 .03; for comparisons from baseline to study end). These improvements in NRS scores were most pronounced in those

2116

CANCER

with moderate to severe symptoms (ie, baseline NRS
score for ‘average’ pain of 4); in this subset, scores
for ‘average’ pain improved by 1 unit every 4 weeks.
Statistically significant improvements in scores upon
serial follow-up were likewise noted in the subset of
patients who were actively receiving chemotherapy
at study entry – the NRS ‘average’ pain score
improved by 0.19 unit per week (P 5 .02; for comparisons from baseline to study end). Similarly, the subgroup that was no longer receiving chemotherapy at
study entry (when compared with patients who were
actively receiving chemotherapy at study entry)
reported greater improvements (when compared
with baseline) in the SDS scores (P 5 .01), QOL Uniscale (P 5 .04), POMS scores (P 5 .003), and McGill
Pain Rating Index (P 5 .001). There was no evidence
for a crossover effect.
Adverse events occurred at relatively equivalent
rates in both groups. There were no differences in
the incidence of fatigue or somnolence reported by
patients who were being treated with gabapentin and
placebo. The maximal tolerated dose achieved was
identical in both groups (median, 2700 mg per day;
or placebo equivalent). Data on adverse events are

DISCUSSION
The currently available options to treat CIPN are
clearly inadequate. Given the relatively high incidence of CIPN, this represents an urgent unmet
medical need. The development of a well-tolerated
nonopioid oral agent for effective therapy of CIPN is
a priority for oncology patients. Gabapentin is known
to have efficacy in treating several neuropathic pain
syndromes and is currently licensed in several countries for such indications. Despite preliminary data
suggesting that gabapentin may be effective in treating pain from CIPN,8,10,12,14 the current study failed
to demonstrate any benefit to using gabapentin for
this indication.
In the current study, the 2 randomized study
groups were well balanced at study entry. The primary study endpoint and virtually all other secondary endpoints were similar in both groups
throughout the duration of the study. The exceptions
were the McGill Pain Rating Index score at 6 weeks
(worse in the P/G cohort) and the NRS score for
‘worst pain’ at 14 weeks (worse in the G/P cohort),
as listed in Table 2. Given their concordance among
all other primary and secondary endpoints, these
findings are likely explainable by multiple testing.
Conclusions from the current trial are similar to
those reported in another recent study, where

patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer were treated concurrently with gabapentin with the aim of preventing
neuropathy,30 with comparisons made with a similar
cohort who received identical chemotherapy. Incidence and severity of neuropathy were found to be
similar in both cohorts, thus suggesting a lack of
benefit of gabapentin use in this setting.30
Gabapentin was remarkably well tolerated in this
patient population. A higher incidence of fatigue had
been expected in this study with gabapentin use, on
the basis of previously published reports that evaluated gabapentin for different indications.31–33 It is
noteworthy that such toxicity was also not prominent
in other peripheral neuropathy trials where gabapentin was evaluated.8,34 Similarly, a high incidence of
somnolence was expected with gabapentin, given
reports in available literature10; however, the incidence of somnolence reported by those treated with
placebo and gabapentin in the current study was
similar.
Data from the current trial are discordant from
animal models that suggest that gabapentin
increases the pain threshold in neuropathy-induced
by chemotherapy.35 Data from some animal experi-

ments suggest that up-regulation of the a2d1 subunit
of the voltage-dependent calcium channels in dorsal
nerve root ganglia (the presumed basis for neuronal
hyperexcitability after nerve injury) does not occur in
the case of nerve injury induced by chemotherapy
exposure (in contrast to nerve injury caused by other
etiologies).36 Because binding of gabapentin to the
a2d1 subunit is the presumed basis for gabapentin’s
antinociceptive effects,5,36 these observations may
explain the lack of efficacy of gabapentin when used
to treat (or prevent) CIPN. Furthermore, unlike
results of these animal experiments, patients with
CIPN develop loss of sensation to light touch, pin
prick, and temperature sensation (that is not hypersensitive)37 rather than mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia. Due to these differences, results of
these experimental studies in animal models may
not be directly applicable to CIPN therapy in oncology patients. A different, and yet undefined, molecular and neurophysiological mechanism may be
responsible for the allodynia caused by CIPN. Hopefully, future research will elucidate the neurobiological basis for CIPN and help identify agents that may
be active in treating them.
In the context of current trial results, it is worth
noting that gabapentin has been demonstrated to be
effective in relieving cancer pain, if the pain is
caused by direct malignant nerve infiltration or compression. In a recently reported study, patients were
enrolled when they had pain due to cancer plexopathy, when they were not actively receiving anticancer
therapies, and when they were already on concurrent
therapy with opioids. Compared with those treated
with placebo, patients randomized to gabapentin
treatment reported a clinically relevant reduction in
neuropathic pain in this study.13
Patients being treated with opioids at baseline
were ineligible to participate in this trial (although
administration of opioids was allowed during the
study). This stipulation might have resulted in the
exclusion of patients with severe pain as the predominant manifestation of CIPN. It can be argued that
this particular subset, ie, those with greater severity
of pain, might have benefited from gabapentin therapy. This is a conjecture at this time; however, a post
hoc subset analysis of patients with the highest pain
scores did not indicate any differential benefit to this
group with gabapentin treatment when compared
with those treated with placebo.
In summary, findings of the current study suggest a lack of benefit to gabapentin use to treat
CIPN-related symptoms. Analysis of pain scores
measured serially in this trial reveals a statistically
significant (and gradual) decline in the severity

2117

of CIPN-related pain in all patients, irrespective of
therapy received. Conceivably, such spontaneous
improvements in CIPN symptoms upon serial evaluation might have been incorrectly attributed to a
treatment effect in previously conducted uncontrolled studies.
