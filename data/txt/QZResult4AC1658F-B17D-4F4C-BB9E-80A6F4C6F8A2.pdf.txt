BACKGROUND: Early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by a highly variable course of disease.
Because it is believed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent suppressors of antitumor immunity, the authors
hypothesized that increased Tregs may favor disease progression. METHODS: Treg levels (cluster of differentiation 3
[CD3]-positive, [CD4]-positive, CD25-positive, and CD127-negative) in peripheral blood from 102 patients were analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate correlations with clinical data. RESULTS: The relative Treg numbers in CD4-positive T cells were significantly greater in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
compared with the numbers in a control group of 170 healthy individuals (P ¼ .001). Patients were divided into 2
groups using a median Treg value of 9.7% (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells). Patients with higher Treg levels
had a significantly shorter time to initial treatment (median, 5.9 years) compared with patients who had lower Treg
levels (median, 11.7 years; log-rank P ¼ .019). Furthermore, Treg levels (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) had significant prognostic power to predict the time to initial treatment in univariate analysis (P ¼ .023) and in multivariate
Cox regression analysis that included the variables Rai stage, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and CD38 expression (P ¼ .028). CONCLUSIONS: Higher Treg levels had significant and independent prognostic power for predicting the time to initial treatment in patients with low to

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has a highly variable disease course, and correct prognostication poses a major
challenge for treating physicians. This applies especially to patients with low-stage to intermediate-stage disease (Rai stages
0, I, and II or Binet stages A and B), whereas the definition of higher stage disease (Rai stages III and IV or Binet stage C)
somehow is equivalent to current criteria for indicating therapy1 and necessitates prompt therapeutic intervention.
In addition to clinical staging,2 various characteristics of the CLL cell, such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable
region (IgVH) mutational status, cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and f-chain (T-cell receptor)-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP70) expression, chromosomal aberrations,3-6 and the cellular microenvironment,7,8 have been identified
that can predict the risk of CLL progression. Ideally, it is not only a question of which patients will progress early but also
why they will progress; therefore, prognostic factors should not only predict the course of the disease but should also be
linked to its pathophysiology. With an understanding of the underlying biologic mechanisms, ultimately, it even may be
possible to therapeutically target a prognostic factor and thereby change a patient’s prognosis.
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent suppressors of immunity, and there is accumulating evidence of their role in the
suppression of antitumor immunity.9 Because, for several solid tumors, there is a clear correlation between high numbers

of Tregs (tumor infiltrating or circulating in the peripheral
blood) and a poor prognosis,10-12 we investigated the role
of Tregs in early stage CLL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was approved by the local ethics committee of
the Provincial Government of Salzburg, Austria and was
conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. One
hundred two consecutive patients with early stage, previously untreated CLL who attended the Third Medical
Department of the Private Medical University Hospital,
Salzburg, Austria between October 2006 and November
2009 were included in this retrospective study. Peripheral
blood samples from patients were collected during routine
examinations. Blood samples were collected from 170
healthy controls (52.9% men, 45.9% women) during a
blood donation rally conducted by the Central Institute
for Blood Transfusion and Immunology, General Hospital and University Clinics, Innsbruck, Austria.
CLL was defined according to current guidelines.1
Staging was performed according to Rai classification.2
The time to initial treatment was defined according to the
period between first diagnosis and first CLL-specific treatment. No deaths (CLL-related or unrelated) occurred
during the observation period. The median observation
time during the clinical course of patients was 52.7
months (range, 1-325 months).
Flow-Cytometric Analysis
Incubation of 100 lL of whole blood with a mixture of
fluorescence-labeled anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD25,
and anti-CD127 monoclonal antibodies for 15 minutes
was followed by lysis of erythrocytes. Subsequent analysis
was performed on an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, Calif). At least 2000 CD3-positive/
CD4-positive T cells were analyzed to ensure reproducible
identification of Treg levels within CD3-positive/CD4positive T cells. Analysis of the prognostic marker CD38
in CLL cells was performed according to a protocol
described previously.7 Flow-cytometric detection of intracellular forkhead box transcription factor P3 (FoxP3) was
performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (eBioscience, San Diego, Calif). Proliferation of T
cells was detected by dilution of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester as described elsewhere.13

Genetic Analysis
For the detection of genomic aberrations (ie, deletion
[del]17p, del11q, del13q, trisomy 12), interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (Abbott/Vysis,
Vienna, Austria) was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH) mutational analysis was performed
according to Fais and coworkers.14 A cutoff of 98%
homology to germ line sequences was used for the detection of unmutated IgVH genes.15

RESULTS
Definition and Stability of Tregs in CLL
To define the Treg content in samples from patients with
CLL, the combination of surface markers CD25 (high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) and CD127
(interleukin-7 receptor) was used in a flow-cytometric
analysis. This definition of Treg has been well established
in samples from healthy controls.16,17 We validated correct Treg identification within CD3-positive/CD4-positive/CD25-positive/CD127-negative cells in a subgroup
of patients with CLL by detecting high intracellular
expression levels of FoxP3 and the ability to suppress Tcell proliferation (Fig. 1).
We determined Treg levels in samples from 102 consecutive patients with early stage and previously untreated
CLL who attended our department (for patient characteristics see Table 1). The median relative Treg percentages in
CD4-positive T cells (standard deviation [SD]) were
9.7%  3.27% (range, 4.86%-23.77%), and the median
absolute Treg numbers (SD) were 92  84/lL (range,
26-620/lL). Because it has been demonstrated that CLL
cells express CD25 to various degrees,18 we investigated
whether a high leukemic burden would bias Treg quantification. We observed no evidence of a correlation between
Treg percentages (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells)
and absolute lymphocyte counts (correlation coefficient
[R2] ¼ 0.003).
Because the proportion of Tregs (the percentage of
CD4-positive T cells) in most samples was measured only
once in previously untreated patients, we investigated a
possible bias caused by the time point of measurement
between first diagnosis and CLL-specific treatment. In a
subgroup analysis among patients who eventually received
CLL-specific treatment (N ¼ 34), we could not identify
any correlation between the proportion of Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) and the time period from

first diagnosis to analysis (R2 ¼ 0.01) or the time period
from analysis to initial treatment (R2 ¼ 0.0003).
Furthermore, we investigated whether the proportion of Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) in
the peripheral blood from patients with CLL succumb to
significant fluctuations over time. Ten patients with progressing disease were assessed repeatedly for Treg (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) during routine clinical
controls until they received CLL-specific therapy. In 8 of
10 patients, we observed only moderate changes in the
percentage of Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T

cells); whereas, in 2 of 10 patients, an increase in Tregs (the
percentage of CD4-positive T cells) could be observed immediately before therapy (Fig. 2).
Tregs Are Elevated in High-Risk CLL
In line with previous reports,19,20 we were able to identify
a statistically significant elevation in Tregs (the percentage
of CD4-positive T cells) in peripheral blood samples from
patients with CLL compared with samples from 170
healthy controls, although there was considerable overlap
between the 2 groups (Fig. 3A) (P ¼ .001; Mann-Whitney U test). Because of an age difference between the
cohorts (mean age [SD]: CLL group, 69.17  10.2
years; healthy controls, 43.2  10.5 years), we checked for
a possible influence of age on the proportion of Tregs (the
percentage of CD4-positive T cells), but they did not
increase with age in the CLL group or the healthy control
group (data not shown).
Subsequently, we compared Tregs (the percentage of
CD4-positive T cells) between various risk groups of
patients with CLL according to established risk factors,
such as IgVH mutational status,3 chromosomal aberrations,4 and CD38 expression.5 Consistently, Tregs (the
percentage of CD4-positive T cells) were significantly

Figure 1. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) from patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) expressed high levels of the
transcription factor forkhead box transcription factor P3
(FoxP3) and were able to suppress T-cell proliferation. FoxP3
expression was assessed by flow cytometry. (A) After gating
for cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)-positive T cells (T4), (B)
Tregs were identified by a CD25-positive/CD127 negative surface marker profile. PE indicates phycoerythrin; SS, side scatter; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. (C) Tregs had high FoxP3
expression compared with an isotype control (dashed line).
Moreover, CD25 negative/CD127-positive T cells had only very
low FoxP3 expression. Representative plots are shown (N ¼
5; percentage of FoxP3-positive [CD4-positive/CD25-positive/CD127-negative] T cells ¼ 78.82%  4.37%; baseline offset function applied). CFSE indicates carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester. (D-H) These plots illustrate an
analysis of the proliferative capacity of CD3-positive/CD4positive/CD25-negative/CD127-positive T cells (defined as
non-Tregs) from patients with CLL in the presence or absence
of autologous Tregs. The percentage of proliferating non-Tregs
in anti-CD3 antibody-coated plates could be reduced by a
mean  standard deviation of 74.6%  8.8% when cultured in
the presence of Tregs (N ¼ 5). The density plots in D through
H exemplify flow-cytometric proliferation assessment by
CFSE dilution of a representative suppression assay experiment, including (D) a negative control without CFSE labeling,
(E) a positive control with CFSE-labeled, unstimulated nonTregs, (F) a positive control with CFSE-labeled and stimulated
non-Tregs, (G) CFSE-labeled and stimulated non-Tregs in the
presence of Tregs, and (H) CFSE-labeled and stimulated nonTregs in the presence of non-Tregs.

had unmutated IgVH (P ¼ .037), high CD38 expression
(P ¼ .034), or chromosomal aberrations other than
del13q or a normal karyotype (P ¼ .002) (Fig. 3B-D). An
alternative analysis that included intermediate-risk
patients with trisomy 12 in the lower risk group (del13q
or normal karyotype) resulted in a similar outcome (P ¼
.002; data not shown).
Treg Numbers Are an Independent Predictor
of the Time to Initial Treatment
Because, in a multivariate analysis of Tregs (the percentage
of CD4-positive T cells) and time to initial treatment, a
single cutoff was required, we divided CLL patients into a
‘‘low Treg’’ group (<9.7%) and a ‘‘high Treg’’ group
(>9.7%) using the median Treg percentage as a cutoff.
Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that there was significant
separation between these groups with a median time to
initial treatment of 5.9 years in the high-risk group compared with 11.7 years in the low-risk group (log-rank test;
P ¼ .019) (Fig. 4). Absolute lymphocyte counts were
available in 83 of the 102 patients with CLL. Accordingly,
patients were grouped according to the median absolute
Treg number (92/lL), and a subsequent Kaplan-Meier
analysis was performed. No significant distinction

cells) during routine clinical examinations. Eight of 10 patients

between the 2 groups could be observed (log-rank test; P
¼ .997).
To evaluate the importance of Treg (the percentage
of CD4-positive T cells) compared with previously established prognostic markers in CLL, we performed a Cox
regression analysis that included Rai stage,2 IgVH mutation status,3 CD38 expression,5 and chromosomal aberrations.4 Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) as
well as Rai stage, IgVH mutation status, and CD38
expression had significant predictive power for the time to
initial treatment in univariate analysis (Table 2); whereas,
in our cohort, chromosomal aberrations did not reach the
required significance level in univariate analysis (P ¼
.087). Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells; P ¼
.028), Rai stage (P ¼ .001), and IgVH mutation status (P
¼ .003) remained significant in multivariate testing,
whereas CD38 expression (P ¼ .741) and chromosomal
aberrations (P ¼ .713) did not (Table 2).

experiments and has been investigated extensively in
human cancers. For several solid tumors, there is a clear
correlation between high Treg numbers (tumor infiltrating
or circulating in the peripheral blood) and a poor prognosis.10,11,21,22 Although previous reports have indicated an
increase of Tregs in the peripheral blood of patients with
CLL compared with healthy controls,19,20 their role in
disease progression has remained unclear. The objective
of the present study was to elucidate the possible clinical
relevance of Treg numbers in early stage CLL.
Most patients who present with higher stage disease
(Rai stages III and IV or Binet stage C) at first diagnosis
promptly fulfill criteria indicating therapy. Prognostication is especially challenging in the larger group of
patients with low to intermediate stage disease (Rai stages
0, I, and II or Binet stages A and B), in which the clinical
disease course may vary considerably. In the light of
improved diagnostics, such as multicolor flow cytometry

and its increased use for further investigation of incidentally diagnosed lymphocytosis, increases in the incidence
and prevalence of early stage CLL or monoclonal B-cell
lymphocytosis23 may be expected in the future.
In the current study, Treg levels (the percentage of
CD4-positive T cells) did not depend on time, lacking a
correlation with time between the first diagnosis and the
point of analysis or with time between the point of analysis and the initial treatment. Even repeated assessments of
patients with CLL who progressed over time revealed only
minor fluctuations, confirming the reliability and reproducibility of Treg measurement in the peripheral blood.
In line with previous reports,19,20 Tregs (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) were significantly increased
in patients with CLL compared with healthy controls, but
the clinical implications of this finding have remained
unclear. Experimental evidence in mouse models supports
the idea of Treg induction by the tumor cell itself,24 a

correlation between Treg values (the percentage of CD4positive T cells) and treatment-free survival in patients
with CLL. Various mechanisms have been described by
which it is believed Tregs exert their immunosuppressive
impact on their respective target cells. Overall, these can
be divided into cell contact-dependent and soluble factors.27 In the current study, we observed an influence of
Tregs on the clinical course of disease only when using relative but not absolute Treg numbers. In our opinion, this
implies the importance of cell-contact or paracrine effects
mediated by Tregs on their target cells, which depend on
relative Treg numbers rather than distant endocrine effects
mediated by Treg cytokines, such as interleukin 10 or
transforming growth factor beta,9 in which cytokine levels
depend on the absolute Treg mass.
The risk conferred by higher Treg levels (the percentage of CD4-positive T cells) was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis. It is
interesting to speculate that an overactive Treg-mediated
suppression of antitumor immunity may result in tumor
progression in CLL. Whether CLL cells can actively
induce Tregs or whether disease progression in CLL is only
a consequence of the given immunologic constitution of a
patient cannot be answered by our study. With Tregdepleting and Treg-increasing substances in hand,28-31 we
have the means to test this hypothesis in preclinical tumor
models, such as the Tcl1-mouse model for CLL.32,33

finding that has been corroborated further in CLL, in
which in vitro experiments have demonstrated that CLL
cells themselves directly drive Treg induction.25 Tregs were
induced by CD70 expressed on CLL cells after CD40 ligation, an effect that could be blocked by anti-CD70 antibodies. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that CD70
expression was increased in CLL cells that were identified
in lymph nodes,26 an environment in which there is intimate contact between T cells and CLL cells.
In the current study, for the first time to our knowledge, we were able to demonstrate a significant inverse

using a median Treg level (calculated as the percentage of
cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4]-positive T cells) of 9.7% as a
cutoff, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed. Low Treg levels
were correlated clearly with a longer time to initial treatment
compared with high Treg levels. Patients in the higher Treg
group had a significantly shorter time to initial treatment
(median, 5.9 years) compared with patients in the lower Treg
group (median, 11.7 years; log-rank P ¼ .019).
