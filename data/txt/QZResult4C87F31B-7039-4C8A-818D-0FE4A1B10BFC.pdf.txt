Abstract
Although aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expressions have been
observed in different types of cancer, their pathophysiologic
role and their relevance to tumorigenesis are still largely
unknown. In this study, we first evaluated the expression of
308 miRNAs in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
normal hepatic tissues and identified 29 differentially
expressed miRNAs in HCC tissues. miR-101, a significantly
down-regulated miRNA, was further studied in greater detail
because the signal pathway(s) regulated by miR-101 and the
role of miR-101 in tumorigenesis have not yet been elucidated.
Interestingly, decreased expression of miR-101 was found in
all six hepatoma cell lines examined and in as high as 94.1% of
HCC tissues, compared with their nontumor counterparts.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-101 dramatically
suppressed the ability of hepatoma cells to form colonies
in vitro and to develop tumors in nude mice. We also found
that miR-101 could sensitize hepatoma cell lines to both serum
starvation– and chemotherapeutic drug–induced apoptosis.
Further investigation revealed that miR-101 significantly
repressed the expression of luciferase carrying the 3¶-untranslated region of Mcl-1 and reduced the endogenous protein level
of Mcl-1, whereas the miR-101 inhibitor obviously up-regulated
Mcl-1 expression and inhibited cell apoptosis. Moreover,
silencing of Mcl-1 phenocopied the effect of miR-101 and
forced expression of Mcl-1 could reverse the proapoptotic
effect of miR-101. These results indicate that miR-101 may
exert its proapoptotic function via targeting Mcl-1. Taken
together, our data suggest an important role of miR-101 in
the molecular etiology of cancer and implicate the potential
application of miR-101 in cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) belong to a class of endogenously
expressed, noncoding small RNAs, which contain f22 nucleotides.
It has been shown that miRNAs can regulate the expression of
protein-coding genes at the posttranscriptional level through

imperfect base pairing with the 3¶-untranslated region (3¶-UTR)
of target mRNAs (1). Growing evidence suggests that deregulation
of miRNAs may contribute to many types of human diseases,
including cancer. It has been shown that 50% of miRNAs are
located within the chromosomal regions known to be frequently
amplified or deleted in human cancer cells (2). Furthermore,
misexpression of miRNAs has been observed in various types of
cancers (3, 4) and is also associated with the clinical outcome of
cancer patients (5, 6). Even more, the expression profiles of miRNAs
give much more accurate classification on the tissue origin of
poorly differentiated cancer cells, compared with that of mRNA (3).
Consistently, miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of
various cellular processes that are often deregulated during
tumorigenesis (1, 7–9). These data highlight the importance of
miRNAs in cancer development and provide new insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common
cancers worldwide and among the leading causes of cancer-related
death (10). Like other cancers, the development of HCC is a
multistep process with accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
changes (11, 12). Altered miRNA expressions have been observed in
HCCs that originated from different geographic areas (5, 8, 13–18).
Furthermore, several miRNAs deregulated in HCC, such as miR-21,
miR-221, miR-223, and miR-224, have been identified as modulators
of cell growth, apoptosis, migration, or invasion (8, 16, 18, 19).
These findings suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the
pathogenesis of HCC. Obviously, more extensive investigations on
the functions of miRNAs that are deregulated in HCC are required
to elucidate the role of miRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis.
In this study, the expression profiles of 308 miRNAs were
examined in human HCC and normal hepatic tissues. Moreover,
a set of significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were
identified in HCC tissues. Further investigation revealed that a
frequently down-regulated miRNA, miR-101, could sensitize tumor
cells to apoptosis and impaired the ability of cancer cells to form
colony in vitro and to develop tumor in vivo. Moreover, myeloid
cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of
Bcl-2 family, was characterized as a direct target of miR-101. Our
findings will help to elucidate the functions of miRNAs and their
roles in tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Tissue specimens and cell lines. Normal liver tissues were collected
from patients undergoing resection of hepatic hemangiomas. Paired HCC
and adjacent nontumor liver tissues were obtained from patients
undergoing resection of HCC. No previous local or systemic treatment
had been conducted for these patients before operation. The specimens
were collected between 2005 and 2006 at the Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen
University, Guangzhou, P.R. China. Tissue samples were immediately snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Both tumor and noncancerous samples

were histologically confirmed. All patients were unrelated ethnic Han
Chinese who lived in Southeast China. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infection was diagnosed when HBV surface antigen
(HBsAg) or HCV antibody was detected by ELISA in the serum isolated
from peripheral blood. HBV infections were identified in two of three
patients with hepatic hemangiomas and in 90.9% of HCC cases, whereas
none of the HCV infection was found in these patients. All HCC tumors
were originated from the background of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient. This study was
approved by the Institute Research Ethics Committee at Cancer Center,
Sun Yat-sen University.
The cell lines used in this study included immortalized mouse embryonic
fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3, SV40-transformed embryonic kidney cell
line 293T, cervical cancer cell line HeLa, immortalized liver cell line
L-02, and six human liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1,
Huh7, QGY-7703, and SMMC-7721). They were all maintained in DMEM
(Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA
Laboratories GmbH).
Microarray. Total RNAs, isolated from five HCCs and three normal
liver tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), were sent to CapitalBio
Corp. for noncoding RNA microarray analysis. The microarray analysis
was done as described on the Web site of CapitalBio.4 Briefly, f60 Ag of
total RNAs were used to extract small-sized RNA using miRNA Isolation
Kit (Ambion, Inc.). Fluorescein-labeled miRNAs were hybridized to each
noncoding RNA microarray slide, which contains probes complementary
to 308 human miRNAs registered in miRBase 11.0.5 Each probe was
spotted in triplicate in each slide and every sample was assayed in
duplicate. The microarray platform and data have been submitted to the
Gene Expression Omnibus public database6 at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, following the Minimum Information About a
Microarray Gene Experiment guidelines. The accession numbers are
GPL7274 (platform) and GSE12717 (samples; release date September 2008).
To allow the comparison among different slides, the signal intensity from
each spot was log transformed and normalized using the quantile
normalization method in the Bioconductor package,7 as described
previously (20). Therefore, the expression level of each miRNA in every
sample was represented by the mean of normalized log-transformed
values from the duplicate slides. To lessen the effect of random fluctuation
on the significance of expression difference, only those miRNAs that
displayed signal intensity higher than 1,000 in at least one of the eight
examined samples were applied to the statistical comparison between the
normal and HCC tissues. This comparison was done with Significance
Analysis of Microarrays in the Bioconductor package.
Northern blot. Small-sized RNAs were enriched from total RNAs using
PEG8000 as described previously (21). Briefly, 100 to 200 Ag of total RNAs in
a volume of 600 AL were mixed with 75 AL each of 50% PEG8000 and
5 mol/L NaCl, followed by incubation on ice for 2 h and centrifugation at
12,000  g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, mixed with 1/10
volume of 3 mol/L sodium acetate and 4 volumes of cold absolute ethanol,
incubated at 20jC overnight and then centrifuged at 24,000  g for 1 h.
The RNA pellet was washed with 80% ethanol, dried briefly, and
resuspended in RNase-free water.
The expression level of miRNAs was examined by Northern blot, as
described previously (22). The DNA oligonucleotide probes used to detect
miR-101 and U6 snRNA were as follows: miR-101-5¶-CTTCAGTTATCACAGTACTGTA and U6-5¶-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT. The band intensity was
quantified using GeneTools software (version 3.03; SynGene).
RNA oligoribonucleotides and cell transfections. miR-101 mimic was
a RNA duplex (Supplementary Fig. S1) designed as described previously
(23). The small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting human Mcl-1 mRNA
(Genbank accession no. NM_021960) was designated as siMCL1

(Supplementary Fig. S1). The control RNA duplex (named as NC) for
both miRNA mimic and siRNA was nonhomologous to any human
genome sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). For in vivo tumorigenicity
assay, all pyrimidine nucleotides in the NC or miR-101 duplex were
substituted by their 2¶-O-methyl analogues to improve RNA stability. The
anti–miR-101, with sequence of 5¶-CUUCAGUUAUCACAGUACUGUA, was
a 2¶-O-methyl–modified oligoribonucleotide designed as an inhibitor of
miR-101. The anti–miR-C, with a sequence of 5¶-GUGGAUAUUGUUGCCAUCA, was used as a negative control for anti–miR-101 in the
antagonism experiment. All the RNA oligoribonucleotide(s) were purchased from Genepharma.
Reverse transfection of RNA oligoribonucleotide(s) was done using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The transfection efficiency, examined by a FAM-conjugated siRNA
and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, was f77% in HepG2 cells
(data not shown). Fifty nanomoles per liter of RNA duplex and 200 nmol/L of
miRNA inhibitor were used for each transfection, unless otherwise indicated.
In the rescue experiment, 24 h after RNA transfection, cells were transfected
with 200 ng plasmids in a 24-well plate, using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen).
Colony formation assay. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 200
transfected cells were placed in a fresh six-well plate and maintained in
DMEM containing 10% FBS for 2 wk. Colonies were fixed with methanol
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 15 min.
Tumorigenicity assays in nude mice. All experimental procedures
involving animals were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication nos. 80-23, revised 1996) and were
performed according to the institutional ethical guidelines for animal
experiment. miR-101– and NC-transfected HepG2 cells (5  104 or 1  105)
were suspended in 100 AL PBS and then injected s.c. into either side of the
posterior flank of the same female BALB/c athymic nude mouse at 5 to 6 wk
of age. Tumor growth was examined daily for at least 5 wk. Tumor volume
(V ) was monitored by measuring the length (L) and width (W) with calipers
and calculated with the formula (L  W 2)  0.5.
Vector construction. pGL3cm was created based on the firefly luciferase
expressing vector pGL3-control (Promega) by creating BstXI, EcoRI, EcoRV,
and ApaI sites immediately upstream of the XbaI site, which was right
downstream of the stop codon of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in pGL3control.
To construct pGL3cm-MCL1-3¶-UTR-WT plasmid, a wild-type 3¶-UTR
segment of human Mcl-1 mRNA (1208-1689 nt, Genbank accession no.
NM_021960) containing the putative miR-101 binding sequence (1547–
1568 nt) was amplified and cloned into the ApaI and XbaI sites downstream
of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3cm. pGL3cm-MCL1-3¶-UTR-MUT,
which carried the mutated sequence in the complementary site for the seed
region of miR-101, was generated based on pGL3cm-MCL1-3¶-UTR-WT
plasmid by site-specific mutagenesis.
To construct the miR-101 expression vector (pc3-miR-101), a fragment
encompassing the mature miR-101 sequence and its 5¶- and 3¶-flanking
regions (213 and 362 bp, respectively) was amplified and then cloned into
the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen).
The plasmid pc3-gab was produced based on pcDNA3.0 by replacing the
neomycin open reading frame with an expression cassette of enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene between the AsuII and BseJI sites. The Mcl-1
expression vector (pc3-gab-MCL1) was created by cloning the Mcl-1 coding
sequence into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pc3-gab.
Luciferase reporter assay. For luciferase reporter assay, 293T cells (6 
104) were plated in a 48-well plate and then cotransfected with 400 ng of
either pc3-miR-101 or pcDNA3.0, 20 ng of either pGL3cm-MCL1-3¶-UTR-WT
or pGL3cm-MCL1-3¶-UTR-MUT, and 4 ng of pRL-TK (Promega), using
calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection
and analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Luciferase activity was detected by M200 microplate fluorescence reader
(Tecan). The pRL-TK vector that provided the constitutive expression of
Renilla luciferase was cotransfected as an internal control to correct the
differences in both transfection and harvest efficiencies. Transfections were
done in duplicates and repeated at least thrice in independent experiments.

Western blot. Cell protein lysates were separated in 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Roche), then detected with rabbit polyclonal
antibody specific for Mcl-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and commercial
ECL kit (Pierce). Protein loading was estimated using mouse anti–h-actin
monoclonal antibody (Boster). The intensity of protein fragments was
quantified using GeneTools software (version 3.03; SynGene).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. To obtain cDNA, 2 Ag of
total RNAs were reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus
reverse transcriptase (Promega). Specific primers used for PCR amplification were as follows: 5¶-AAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG and 5¶GCAGCTCGTAGCTCTTCTCCAG for h-actin, and 5¶-AGAAAGCTGCATCGAACCAT and 5¶-CCAGCTCCTACTCCAGCAAC for Mcl-1. PCR products
were then separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and
visualized under UV trans-illumination. Quantification of each product was
done using GeneTools software (version 3.03; SynGene).

Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by the apoptotic morphology, the activity of caspase-3/7, and the cell viability. For morphologic
examination, cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma-Aldrich) and those with fragmented or condensed nuclei were
counted as apoptotic cells. At least 500 cells were counted for each
sample.
The activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7 was detected in 96-well format
using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega). One hundred microliters of the
Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent were added to each well and then incubated at
room temperature for 1 h. The luminescence was detected using the M200
microplate fluorescence reader (Tecan). The background luminescence
associated with cell culture and assay reagent (blank reaction) was
subtracted from experimental value.
Cell viability was determined by the Alamar blue assay (AbD Serotec).
Briefly, cells were transfected in a 24-well plate and replated into a 96-well
plate at 10% confluency 24 h later, followed by the Alamar blue assay at
indicated times. Fluorescence of the reduced Alamar blue dye was
measured using M200 microplate fluorescence reader (Tecan) at excitation
wavelength of 540 nm and emission wavelength of 590 nm.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SEM from at least
three separate experiments. Multiple group comparisons were performed
using ANOVA with a post hoc test for subsequent individual group
comparisons. Differences were considered statistically significant at
P < 0.05.

Results
miRNAs are differentially expressed in human HCC tissues.
We first compared the miRNA expression profiles of three normal
liver and five primary HCC samples. Among 308 human miRNAs
analyzed, 29 of them exhibited significantly differential expression
in HCC tissues (Table 1). The relative expression of these miRNAs is
presented as a Heat Map in Supplementary Fig. S2. Among the
15 miRNAs that displayed decreased expression in HCC, miR-101
attracted our attention. The miR-101 coding genes, MIRN101-1 and
MIRN101-2, are located in the genomic loci with high frequency of
allelic losses in several type of cancers (24, 25), including HCC
(f40%; ref. 26). In addition, down-regulation of miR-101 has been
observed in HCC (5) and cancers originated from lung (27), breast
(28), cervix (29), and ovary (30), suggesting that deregulation of
miR-101 may be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the signal
pathway(s) regulated by miR-101 and the role of miR-101 in
tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. Therefore, miR-101 was
chosen for further study in greater detail.
Expression of miR-101 is frequently reduced in human HCC
tissues and hepatoma cell lines. First, Northern blot analysis was
performed to analyze the expression level of miR-101 in mouse
and human normal liver tissues, and in cell lines including NIH/
3T3, 293T, HeLa, L-02, as well as six human liver cancer cell lines
(HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1, Huh7, QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721). The
mature form of miR-101 was readily detectable in both SV40transformed 293T and immortalized NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes
6 and 7), but at an obvious lower level compared with that in
mouse and human normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 12).
In marked contrast, significant reduction in the expression of
miR-101 was observed in L-02 and all cancer cell lines examined
(Fig. 1A).
The expression level of miR-101 was further examined in 17
paired HCC and adjacent nontumor liver tissues. In comparison
with the adjacent noncancerous tissues, miR-101 was downregulated in all tumor samples except case 631 (94.1%; Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, 13 of 17 (76.5%) HCC tissues revealed >50% reduction
in the miR-101 level, relative to the corresponding nontumor

results were reproducible when a larger number of cells (1  105)
were injected into another five nude mice. Consistently, miR-101–
transfected HepG2 cells did not produce any tumors 5 weeks after
injection, whereas NC transfectants produced tumors (mean size
of 584 F 187 mm3 at the end of observation) in 4 of 5 (80%) mice
(Fig. 2B) 17 to 20 days after inoculation. These results indicate
that introduction of miR-101 significantly inhibits tumorigenicity
of HepG2 cells in nude mouse xenograft model.
Mcl-1 is a direct target of miR-101. The inhibitory role of miR101 in tumorigenicity indicates that miR-101 may promote cell
apoptosis and/or inhibit cell proliferation. It is generally accepted
that miRNAs exert their function through regulating the
expression of their downstream target gene(s). Thus, putative
miR-101 targets were predicted using target prediction programs,
TargetScan and miRanda. Our analysis revealed that Mcl-1, an
antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family, was a potential target of
miR-101. The 3¶-UTR of Mcl-1 mRNA contained a complementary
site for the seed region of miR-101 (Fig. 3A). In addition, Mcl-1
had been shown to be up-regulated in different cancer cells (31,
32) and to protect cells from various stimuli-induced apoptosis
(33, 34).

U6 probe, as indicated on the left. U6 was used as a control for RNA loading. The
intensity for each band was densitometrically quantified. The value under
each lane in A indicates the relative expression level of miR-101, which is
represented by the intensity ratio between miR-101 and U6 fragments in each
lane. The value under each pair of samples in B indicates the fold change of
relative miR-101 expression level in HCC tissue, relative to that in adjacent
nontumor tissue.

samples. These results suggest that reduced miR-101 expression is
a frequent event in human HCC tissues and maybe involved in
hepatocarcinogenesis.
miR-101 suppresses colony formation in vitro and
tumorigenicity in vivo. The significant reduction of miR-101
expression in HCC samples prompted us to explore the
possible biological significance of miR-101 in tumorigenesis. As
an initial step, the capacity of colony formation was evaluated on
liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and QGY-7703) as well as cervical
cancer cell line (HeLa) that were transfected with control RNA
duplex (NC), miR-101 duplex, or without any transfection.
Interestingly, miR-101–transfected cells displayed much fewer and
smaller colonies compared with NC transfectants and nontransfected cells (Fig. 2A). These data indicate a growth-inhibitory role
of miR-101.
To further confirm the above findings, an in vivo model was
used. NC- and miR-101–transfected HepG2 cells were injected s.c.

the first experimental group, 5  104 cells were injected and four
nude mice were included. Five weeks after injection, no tumors
were observed in the flanks injected with miR-101–transfected
HepG2 cells. In sharp contrast, tumors appeared in the sites
injected with NC transfectants in 3 of 4 (75%) mice. The tumor
became palpable 24 to 29 days after inoculation and grew to
36 to 155 mm3 at the end of observation (35 days). These

miR-101 Regulates Apoptosis and Tumorigenicity

Figure 3. Mcl-1 is a direct target of miR-101. A, putative miR-101–binding
sequence in the 3¶-UTR of Mcl-1 mRNA. Mutation was generated on the
Mcl-1 3¶-UTR sequence in the complementary site for the seed region of
miR-101, as indicated. A human Mcl-1 3¶-UTR fragment containing wild-type or
mutant miR-101–binding sequence was cloned downstream of the luciferase
reporter gene. B, analysis of luciferase activity. Cells were cotransfected with
Renilla luciferase expression construct pRL-TK, firefly luciferase reporter
plasmid containing either wild-type or mutant Mcl-1 3¶-UTR (indicated as WT or
MUT on the X -axis), and either the miR-101–expressing plasmid (indicated as
miR-101) or empty pcDNA3.0 (mock) vector. Luciferase activity was assayed
48 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase activity of each sample was normalized
by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized luciferase activity for the mock
cells was set as relative luciferase activity 1. Columns, mean of at least three
independent experiments done in duplicate; bars, SEM. ***, P < 0.001,
compared with cells transfected with empty pCDNA3.0 vector. C, suppressed
expression of endogenous Mcl-1 by miR-101. Western blot (left ) and reverse
transcription-PCR (right ) were used to monitor the expression level of
endogenous Mcl-1 in HepG2 cells 48 h after transfection with miR-101 or
control RNA duplex (NC). D, elevated expression of endogenous Mcl-1 by
antagonism of miR-101. HepG2 cells were transfected with anti–miR-101
(inhibitor of miR-101) or anti–miR-C (negative control), and applied to Western
blot analysis 48 h later. In C and D, h-actin was used as an internal control.
The intensity for each band was densitometrically quantified. The value under
each lane indicates the relative expression level of Mcl-1, which is represented
by the intensity ratio between Mcl-1 and h-actin fragments in each lane. RNA
oligoribonucleotides transfected into HepG2 cells are indicated over each lane.
HepG2, nontransfected cells.

To validate whether Mcl-1 is a bona fide target of miR-101, a
human Mcl-1 3¶-UTR fragment containing wild-type or mutant
miR-101–binding sequence (Fig. 3A) was cloned downstream of
the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Interestingly, the relative
luciferase activity of the reporter that contained wild-type 3¶-UTR
was significantly suppressed when pc3-miR-101 was cotransfected (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the luciferase activity of mutant
reporter was unaffected by simultaneous transfection of pc3miR-101 (Fig. 3B), indicating that miR-101 may suppress gene
expression through miR-101–binding sequence at the 3¶-UTR of
Mcl-1.
The effect of miR-101 on the endogenous expression of Mcl-1
was further examined. We found that ectopic expression of miR101 caused a dose-dependent decrease in Mcl-1 protein but not
mRNA level (Fig. 3C). Moreover, inhibition of endogenous miR-101
by synthetic miR-101 inhibitor (anti–miR-101) resulted in upregulation of the Mcl-1 protein (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that
miR-101 may inhibit the expression of Mcl-1 at posttranscriptional
level by directly targeting the 3¶-UTR of Mcl-1 mRNA.
miR-101 sensitizes hepatoma cells to apoptosis. It is well
demonstrated that knockdown of Mcl-1 can sensitize cancer cells

www.aacrjournals.org

to apoptosis induced by different stimuli, such as serum starvation
(33) or chemotherapeutic drugs (34). Considering miR-101 as a
negative regulator of Mcl-1, and evading apoptosis may favor
malignant transformation or confer cancer cells with resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs, we further investigated whether miR-101
could promote apoptosis of tumor cells. We found that miR-101
had no obvious effect on cell viability under normal culture
conditions (data not shown).
Rapid growth of malignancy results in insufficient blood supply;
solid cancer cells thus should evolve to tolerate nutrition
starvation. The effect of miR-101 on the apoptosis of serumdeprived HepG2 cells was hereby evaluated by morphologic
examination, cell viability, and caspase-3/7 activity assays. Twenty-four hours after transfection with NC or miR-101, cells were
deprived of serum for 48 or 72 h before morphologic examination.
Compared with NC-transfected cells, miR-101 transfectants displayed higher apoptotic rates both 48 h (31.2% versus 16.5%) and
72 h (87.7% versus 35.1%) after serum starvation (Fig. 4A), whereas
NC transfectants revealed a similar frequency of apoptosis as
nontransfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A). The cell viability analysis

sensitizes cancer cells to serum starvation–induced apoptosis. HepG2 cells were
reverse transfected with RNA oligoribonucleotides (as indicated) and cultured
in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. Then, the medium was replaced with
serum-free DMEM for the indicated times and cells were applied to apoptosis
analysis. Nontransfected cells (HepG2) were also included as control. In A,
examination for apoptotic morphology was performed 48 and 72 h after serum
starvation by staining cells with DAPI. In B, cell viability was evaluated by
Alamar blue assay 24, 48, and 72 h after serum deprivation. In C, the relative
caspase-3/7 activity was measured using caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
48 h after serum starvation. The caspase-3/7 activity for cells transfected with the
controls (column 1 ) was set as relative caspase-3/7 activity 1. D, miR-101
sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. HepG2
cells were reverse transfected with RNA duplex (as indicated) for 24 h, refreshed
with medium containing etoposide (1.5 Ag/mL for 48 h), curcumin (12.5 Amol/L
for 48 h), or doxorubicin (0.2 Ag/mL for 36 h), followed by apoptosis analysis
using DAPI staining. Nontransfected cells (HepG2) were also included as
control. Columns, mean of at least three independent experiments; bars, SEM.

Cancer Research

using Alamar blue (Fig. 4B) also showed that miR-101 was effective
in suppressing the growth of HepG2 cells under serum starvation.
Furthermore, obvious increase in caspase-3/7 activity was found
in miR-101–transfected cells compared with NC transfectants
(f2.4-fold; Fig. 4C, columns 1 and 2). Interestingly, antagonism
with anti–miR-101 counteracted the apoptosis-promoting effects of
both exogenous (Fig. 4C, columns 2 and 4) and endogenous miR101 (Fig. 4C, columns 1 and 3), although the extent of antagonism
was more evident on the exogenous than the endogenous miR-101,
which might be explained by the low basal level of miR-101 in
HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Taken together, these results indicate
that miR-101 increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to serum
starvation.
Next, we investigated whether miR-101 could sensitize tumor
cells to chemotherapeutic drug–induced apoptosis. Compared
with the NC-transfected group, enhanced expression of
miR-101 caused obvious increase in the apoptotic rates of HepG2
cells exposed to etoposide, curcumin, or doxorubicin (1.8-, 2.2-,
and 2.6-fold, respectively; Fig. 4D). These data clearly suggest a
role of miR-101 in sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs.
Mcl-1 is potentially involved in miR-101–regulated
apoptosis. To investigate whether Mcl-1 is involved in miR101–promoted apoptosis, the effect of miR-101 on the Mcl-1
expression under the condition of serum starvation was first
examined. The repression effect of miR-101 was still observed
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We then investigated whether reduction
of Mcl-1 expression may mimic the apoptosis-promoting effect of
miR-101 overexpression. HepG2 was transfected with siMCL1 or
NC for 24 h and then applied to serum starvation for another 48
h. The results revealed that siMCL1 transfection caused
significant reduction in the levels of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, siMCL1 transfectants displayed obvious
increases both in the capase-3/7 activity (1.7-fold; Fig. 5B) and
in the proportion of cells with apoptotic morphology (2.3-fold;
Fig. 5C), compared with NC-transfected cells. Notably, the
apoptosis-promoting effect of Mcl-1 knockdown was similar to
that of miR-101 overexpression (Fig. 5B and C). These results
were reproducible with other two hepatoma cell lines, QGY-7703
and SMMC-7721 (Fig. 5C). Next, we examined whether Mcl-1
could counteract the proapoptotic function of miR-101. HepG2
cells were transfected with miR-101 duplex for 24 hours and
followed by transfection with pc3-gab-MCL1, which encoded the
entire Mcl-1 coding sequence but lacked the 3¶-UTR of Mcl-1
mRNA. Interestingly, the resulting Mcl-1 overexpression obviously
abrogated miR-101–promoted apoptosis (Fig. 5D). Taken together,
our results suggest that Mcl-1 is potentially involved in miR-101–
regulated apoptosis.

Discussion
Although deregulation of miRNAs has been frequently observed
in tumor tissues (3, 4), little is known about the molecular
mechanisms by which miRNAs modulate the process of tumorigenesis and the behavior of cancer cells. We showed that miR-101
was frequently down-regulated in both hepatoma cell lines and
human HCC tissues. We also revealed that miR-101 could suppress
colony formation in vitro, inhibit tumor growth in vivo, and
sensitize hepatoma cell lines to apoptosis induced by serum
starvation as well as chemotherapeutic drugs. We further
characterized Mcl-1 as a functional target of miR-101. Reduced

efficiently inhibits the expression of Mcl-1 at both mRNA and protein levels.
RT-PCR (top) and Western blot (bottom ) were used to monitor the expression of
endogenous Mcl-1 48 h after transfection with siRNA for MCL1 (siMCL1) or
control RNA (NC). Nontransfected cells (HepG2) were also included as control.
h-Actin served as an internal control. The intensity for each band was
densitometrically quantified. The value under each lane indicates the relative
expression level of Mcl-1, which is represented by the intensity ratio between
the Mcl-1 and the h-actin fragments in each lane. B and C, either Mcl-1
knockdown or miR-101 overexpression increases the cellular sensitivity to
apoptosis. In B, HepG2 cells were reverse transfected with siMCL1, miR-101, or
control RNA (NC) for 24 h, followed by serum deprivation for 48 h. Cells were
then applied to the assay for caspase-3/7 activity. The caspase-3/7 activity for
cells transfected with NC (column 1) was set as relative caspase-3/7 activity 1. In
C, cells (indicated on the X-axis) were transfected with siMCL1, miR-101, or
NC for 24 h, followed by serum deprivation for 48 h (HepG2) or 72 h (QGY-7703
and SMMC-7721). Examination for apoptotic morphology was performed by
staining cells with DAPI. D, overexpression of Mcl-1 abrogates the proapoptotic
effect of miR-101. HepG2 cells were first transfected with miR-101 or NC
duplex, and then with Mcl-1–expressing vector pc3-gab-MCL1 (indicated as
GFP/Mcl-1) or empty vector pc3-gab (GFP) 24 h later. Twenty-four hours after
vector transfection, cells were serum deprived for another 24 h before
morphologic examination for apoptotic cells. Columns, mean of at least three

expression of miR-101 has been observed in different types of
cancers (5, 27–30). In addition, reduced expression of miR-101 is
associated with worse survival of HCC patients (17). All these
findings emphasize a fundamental role of miR-101 in tumorigenesis, especially in the development of HCC.
Apoptosis is a major barrier that must be circumvented during
malignant transformation. Cancer cells evolve to evade apoptosis
so that they can escape from being cleared away by the surveillance
system and can survive in the crucial tumor microenvironment,
such as hypoxia and low nutrition (35). In this study, we showed
that miR-101 sensitized cancer cells to serum deprivation–induced
apoptosis, whereas the inhibitor of miR-101 antagonized this effect
of miR-101, suggesting that miR-101 may play a critical role in the
adaptation of cancer cells to low nutrition. Growing numbers of
miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of apoptotic cell
death and in the development of cancers. For instance, miR-15a
and miR-16-1, which are down-regulated in the majority of chronic

lymphocytic leukemia patients, induce apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 (7). On the other hand, miRNAs acting in an antiapoptotic
manner can be illustrated by miR-21, which is frequently overexpressed in cancers (8, 9).
Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family. Depletion of
Mcl-1 has been well proven to sensitize human cancer cells to
apoptosis (32–34). Furthermore, the Mcl-1 transgenic mice exhibit
a high probability of developing B-cell lymphoma (36). Although
Mcl-1 mutation is an infrequent event, increased Mcl-1 protein
level is commonly observed in various types of cancers, including
HCC (32). Even more, overexpression of Mcl-1 is correlated with
shorter survival of cancer patients (37), which is consistent with the
finding that down-regulation of miR-101 is associated with worse
survival (17). We postulate that functional loss of miR-101 may
result in enhanced expression of Mcl-1 and in turn the resistance of
cells to apoptosis, which consequently favors tumor progression.
To date, three genes, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2/PTGS2),
EZH2/ENX-1, and MYCN, have been identified as targets of miR-101
(38, 39). miR-101 has been implicated in the process of mouse
embryo implantation by targeting COX-2 (38). It has been shown
that COX-2 signaling is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and COX2 inhibitors prevent HCC cell growth in vitro and in animal models
(40). EZH2/ENX-1 and MYCN are another two targets of miR-101
confirmed by the luciferase reporter system (39). EZH2 has been
shown to be overexpressed in HCC, and suppression of EZH2 in
hepatoma cell lines significantly reduced their growth rate in vitro
and markedly diminished their tumorigenicity in vivo (41). MYCN is
a member of MYC family. Amplification of this gene has been
observed in a variety of tumors, most notably neuroblastomas (42).
The target genes regulated by miR-101 may function spatiotemporally or in cooperation in different cellular processes. Our
identification of Mcl-1 as a target of miR-101 provides new insights
into the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and resistance to
apoptosis. It is fantastic that a miRNA controls a number of genes
that favor the process of tumorigenesis, as introduction of such a
single miRNA may modulate complex downstream signals and
even prevent malignant transformation.
It is noteworthy that miR-101 is significantly down-regulated in
the majority of cancer cell lines and cancer tissues examined, and
miR-101 not only suppresses colony formation in vitro and
tumorigenicity in vivo but also sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis
induced by various chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, therapeutic
strategies to introduce miR-101 into cancer cells may be potentially
useful not only in retarding the process of tumorigenesis but also in
sensitizing cancer cells to anticancer therapy. Further work is
warranted to evaluate the application of miR-101 in cancer therapy
in vivo. Moreover, miR-101 may also be used as a prognostic factor
for cancer patients.
The microarray analysis in this study identified 29 miRNAs
that were significantly differentially expressed in HCC tissues.

Compared with previous studies in HCC, we found similar trend of
deregulation in 11 miRNAs, including miR-101 (5), miR-125b (8),
miR-195 (13, 14, 16), miR-199a (5, 13–15), miR-216a (18), miR-210
(8), miR-222 (8, 15, 16, 18), miR-224 (13, 15, 18), miR-223 (5, 14),
miR-25 (18), and miR-29c (43). On the other hand, there also exists
inconsistency among others and our results, which may attribute to
different methodologies used, and/or distinct etiologic factors in
different studied cohorts, such as HBV, HCV, and aflatoxin B1
exposure. The majority of HCC patients included in this study were
HBsAg positive. Therefore, the miRNA expression patterns we
identified may mainly represent the alterations in HBV-positive
HCC tissues. Because only one HBV-negative sample in each of the
HCC and normal control groups is used in our microarray analysis,
we were unable to perform statistical comparison on the profiles of
differentially expressed miRNAs between HBV-positive and HBVnegative HCCs. Obviously, future studies including larger size of
HBV-positive and HBV-negative samples are required to elucidate
the effect of HBV infection on the outcome of miRNA profiles in
HCC.
It is unlikely that HBV infection itself but not the tumorigenesis
induced the differential expression patterns of miRNAs in our set of
HCCs. This contention is based on the following observations.
First, HBV infection was prevalent in both HCC and normal control
groups used in microarray analysis, with two of three normal liver
tissues and four of five HCC samples were HbsAg positive. Second,
the expression analysis disclosed that miR-101 was down-regulated
in 94.1% of tumor samples (Fig. 1B), compared with matched
adjacent noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, HBV-negative HCC
tissue (no. 714 in Fig. 1B) displayed f90% reduction in the miR101 level, relative to the corresponding nontumor sample. Third, it
has been reported that HBV infection alone is insufficient to induce
major changes in miRNA expression (5).
In summary, we report the altered miRNA expression pattern in
HCC and investigate the potential role of miR-101 in tumorigenesis.
Our data suggest an important role of miR-101 in the molecular
etiology of cancer and implicate the potential application of miR101 in cancer therapy.
