Abstract
Cancer chemopreventive agent sulforaphane (SFN) and
dibenzoylmethane (DBM) showed antitumorigenesis effects
in several rodent carcinogenesis models. In this study, we
investigated the cancer chemopreventive effects and the
underlying molecular mechanisms of dietary administration
of SFN and DBM alone or in combination in the Apc Min/+ mice
model. Male Apc Min/+ mice (12 per group) at age of 5 weeks
were given control AIN-76A diet, diets containing 600 ppm
SFN and 1.0% DBM, or a combination of 300 ppm SFN
and 0.5% DBM for 10 weeks. Mice were then sacrificed, and
tumor numbers and size were examined. Microarray analysis,
Western blotting, ELISA, and immunohistochemical staining
were done to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer chemopreventive effects of SFN and DBM.
Dietary administrations of SFN and DBM alone or in combination significantly inhibited the development of intestinal
adenomas by 48% (P = 0.002), 50% (P = 0.001), and 57%
(P < 0.001), respectively. Dietary administration of 600 ppm
SFN and 1.0% DBM also reduced colon tumor numbers by
80% (P = 0.016) and 60% (P = 0.103), respectively, whereas the
combination of SFN and DBM treatment blocked the colon
tumor development (P = 0.002). Both SFN and DBM treatments resulted in decreased levels of prostaglandin E2
or leukotriene B4 in intestinal polyps or apparently normal
mucosa. Treatments also led to the inhibition of cell survival
and growth-related signaling pathways (such as Akt and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase) or biomarkers (such
as cyclooxygenase-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
cleaved caspases, cyclin D1, and p21). In conclusion, our
results showed that both SFN and DBM alone as well as
their combination are potent natural dietary compounds for
chemoprevention of gastrointestinal cancers. [Cancer Res

cancer in both men and women in the United States. In 2006, an
estimated 148,610 new cases were diagnosed, and 55,170 deaths
from colorectal cancer will occur in the United States (1). Although
most colorectal cancers are sporadic (90%), early Apc mutation was
also found in 50% to 80% of cases. The mutation of Apc gene
will cause the dysregulation of Wnt signaling pathway in which
elevated h-catenin levels in nucleus lead to the transcription of
many cell proliferation-related genes (2). The constitutive activation of the Wnt/h-catenin/Tcf4 signaling pathway resulting from
the mutation of Apc is therefore believed to be a major cause of the
development of human colorectal cancer.
Epidemiologic studies indicated that the incidence of colon
cancer is inversely correlated with the consumption of fruits and
vegetables (3). Many dietary phytochemicals have been investigated for their colon cancer chemopreventive effects using rodent
colorectal cancer models, such as the Apc Min/+ mouse, which
mimics the rapid development of adenomatous polyps that affect
human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadic
colorectal cancer patients with early Apc mutation. Sulforaphane
(SFN) is one of the major isothiocyanates found as its glucosinolate
precursor glucoraphanin in cruciferous vegetables, such as
broccoli, and has been shown to possess strong anticancer effect
(4). Our recent short-term SFN chemoprevention study in Apc Min/+
mice also showed that it could strongly inhibit the intestinal
neoplasia development in this model (5). Dibenzoylmethane (DBM)
is a minor constituent of licorice that has shown strong antimutagenic activity. DBM could inhibit 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA)-induced breast tumorigenesis in mice (6, 7) and DMBAinduced mammary carcinogenesis in rats (8). DBM could also
induce human colorectal carcinoma cells COLO 205 apoptosis
through coordinative regulation of cyclin D3, Bcl-XL, Bax, and
cytochrome c release in vitro (9).
In this study, we further investigated the long-term chemopreventive efficacy of SFN at dose of 600 ppm in the Apc Min/+ mice
model based on our previous results (5). In addition, we also
examined the colorectal cancer chemopreventive effect of DBM for
the first time in this study. DBM was given at dose of 1.0% in diet
based on its previous mammary gland tumor chemoprevention
study (7). The selection of SFN and DBM as well as their
combination in this study is based on their potential different
mechanisms in inhibition of human colon cancer cell growth
illustrated in previous in vitro studies (10). SFN could inhibit
human colon carcinoma HT-29 cell growth by inducing G1 cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis, probably through the regulation of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), without affecting the
Akt pathway (10). On the other hand, our preliminary studies of
DBM in HT-29 cells showed that DBM could significantly inhibited

cancer cell growth by inhibiting Akt pathway activity. Therefore,
a combination treatment of SFN and DBM at half of the single
dose was included to investigate their potential synergistic effect
on colon cancer chemoprevention in this model. The in vivo
mechanisms of chemoprevention of adenomatous lesions in the
Apc Min/+ mouse model by SFN and DBM were investigated by
examining their effects on tumor development, arachidonic acid
metabolism, cell survival signaling pathways, cell growth and
apoptosis, as well as global gene expression profiles in intestinal
polyps and apparently normal mucosa.

Materials and Methods
Animal and treatment protocol. Male Apc Min/+ mice were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory at age of 4 weeks. Treatments were started
after 1 week of acclimatization. Total of 48 Apc Min/+ mice was randomly
divided into four groups. Group 1 was given the control AIN-76A diet
(Research Diets), group 2 was given 600 ppm SFN–supplemented AIN-76A
diet, group 3 was given 1% DBM–supplemented AIN-76A diet, and group 4
was given AIN-76A diet supplemented with 300 ppm SFN and 0.5% DBM.
Mice were housed at Rutgers Animal Facility under 12-h light/dark cycles
with free access to water and food. Mice were check daily for signs of illness
and fresh diet was given daily during the 10-week treatment period.
Tissue processing and tumor scoring. All mice were euthanized by
CO2 after treatment, blood was collected immediately by heart puncture,
and plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at 80jC until
further analysis. Processing of small intestine, colon, and tumor scoring
were carried out as described previously (5). Briefly, the total number and
size of polyps on intestinal segments and colon was examined under an
Olympus SZH10 stereo dissecting microscope. After that, a small part of
small intestine segment was collected for drug concentration measurement,
total RNA extraction, and histopathology/immunohistochemical staining.
The counting and characterization of all tumors were done blinded with
respect to the treatment group. All immunohistochemical determinations
were made with 400-fold magnification with a light microscope. These
examinations were also done blinded with respect to the treatment group.
The rest of the small intestine was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at 80jC until further Western blotting analysis.
Quantification of SFN and DBM in plasma and small intestine using
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Plasma and small intestine
concentrations of SFN and its major glutathione conjugate metabolite
SFN-GSH in Apc Min/+ mice after 10 weeks of consumption of AIN-76
diets containing 300 and 600 ppm of SFN were measured as described
previously (5). DBM concentrations in plasma and small intestine were also
analyzed using similar liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)
methods. Briefly, a 50-AL plasma samples were added to internal standard
curcumin at a final concentration of 50 ng/mL. The spiked plasma samples
were extracted twice with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate/methanol (95:5, v/v).
After centrifugation, the organic phase was transferred to a clean tube and
evaporated to dryness using nitrogen gas. The samples were then
reconstituted in acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and filtered through a
0.45-Am spin filter, and 20 AL of supernatant were subjected to LC/MS
analysis. For small intestine samples, samples were first completely
homogenized in 2 volumes (w/v) of water using a tissue homogenizer
followed by 30 s of sonification. DBM in the homogenates was extracted
using the ethyl acetate/methanol method described above. The highperformance liquid chromatography and LC/MS system were same as
described in the SFN analysis except an analytic Synergi Max-RP C12
150  2.0 mm column (Phenomenex) was used for the analysis.
Measurement of prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 levels in small
intestine. Frozen intestinal polyps and normal mucosa were quickly
excised from the small intestines under frozen condition and then
homogenized using a Polytron in an ice-cold homogenizing buffer
containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
2.5 Ag/mL of pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin), 10 Amol/L nordihydroguaiaretic acid [a lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor], and 10 Amol/L indometh-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

acin [a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor; ref. 11]. The homogenates were
then centrifuged at 14,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the supernatant was
aliquoted and stored at 80jC. The concentration of prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was measured using an EIA kit (Cayman
Chemical) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Apoptosis and proliferation immunohistochemical staining. The
apoptotic cells were detected using an ApopTag In situ Apoptosis Detection
kit (Chemicon). The assay was done according to the manufacturer’s
manual. After deparaffinization, the tissue sections were incubated with
proteinase K for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were then
incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme at 37jC for
1 h, washed thrice with PBS, and incubated with antidigoxigenin conjugate
in a humidified chamber at room temperature for 30 min. The color was
developed by incubating the sections with peroxidase substrate and then
counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. For detection of proliferative cells,
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (1:50; Dako) was used.
The assay was done following the manufacturer’s protocols. The scoring of
apoptotic and proliferative cells was done at 400. A positive control slide
of rat mammary glands provided by the manufacturer was used as positive
control for the in situ apoptosis detection assay. For the PCNA staining,
small intestinal crypt cells were used as an internal positive control.
Western blotting analysis. Intestinal polyps and normal mucosa were
excised from the small intestines from individual Apc Min/+ mice and pooled
together based on the treatment group. To prepare total cell lysate, about
30 to 50 polyps were incubated with 2 mL lysis buffer in an ice-cold French
Douncer for 15 min before homogenization by 40 strokes. The homogenates
were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The
supernatants were further diluted and protein concentrations were
measured by bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). A total amount of 30 Ag
protein was resolved on precasted SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), and Western
blotting was done as described earlier (5).
Total RNA preparation and microarray analysis. Total RNA was
extracted from intestinal polyps and normal mucosa samples collected from
individual Apc Min/+ mice as described previously (5). After examining the
quality and concentration of RNA samples, an equal amount of total RNA
from individual mouse within the same group was pooled together and
submitted to the DNA Core Expression Facility of University of Medicine
and Dentistry of New Jersey for microarray analysis. Affymetrix Mouse
Genome 430 2.0 Array was used to analyze the global gene expression
patterns in the Apc Min/+ mice polyps and normal mucosa samples from all
the groups (total of eight microarrays was used). Genes that were induced
or inhibited >2-fold by treatments comparing with control were identified
using GeneSpring 6.0 software. To further validate the microarray results,
quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine the effect of drug
administration on individual genes.
Quantitative real-time PCR for microarray data validation. To verify
microarray data, several genes [including housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] from different categories were
chosen for quantitative real-time PCR analyses. The specific primers for
these genes were designed by using PrimerExpress software (Applied
Biosystems). The procedure of real-time PCR was described previously
(12). The gene expression changes compared with control sample were
determined after normalization with the corresponding GAPDH expression
level. The correlation between corresponding microarray data and real-time
PCR data was validated by using Spearman rank correlation method.
Statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA analysis and post hoc Tukey’s test
were used to compare mean value between different groups. For simple
group means analysis, two-tailed t test was used.

Results
Dietary administration of SFN and DBM alone or in
combination for 10 weeks significantly inhibited intestinal
polyposis without affecting body weight in Apc Min/+ mice. At
age of 15 weeks, mice in the control group developed an average of
51.5 intestinal polyps (Fig. 1A). Dietary consumption of 600 ppm
SFN and 1.0% DBM alone or in combination at half dose for

Colon Tumor Prevention by SFN and DBM

Figure 1. Dietary administration of 600 ppm SFN, 1.0% DBM, or combination
of 300 ppm SFN and 0.5% DBM in diet for 10 wk significantly inhibited intestinal
(A) and colon (B) tumor development in Apc Min/+ mice. One-way ANOVA
and post hoc Tukey’s test were used to compare the means between treated
groups and control group (n = 12). P values were shown for each treated group.

10 weeks reduced the intestinal polyps formation by 48% (P =
0.002), 50% (P = 0.001), and 57% (P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, the number of large-sized polyps (>2 mm) was more
significantly decreased than the number of small-sized polyps by all
treatments (Table 1). Dietary administration of 600 ppm SFN and
1.0% DBM also inhibited colon tumor numbers by 80% (P = 0.016)
and 60% (P = 0.103), respectively; whereas the combination of SFN
and DBM treatment completely blocked the colon tumor
development (P = 0.002; Fig. 1B). No significant body weight
change nor noticeable signs of toxicity were observed in treatment
groups compared with control group (data not shown) during the
treatments.
Plasma and small intestine concentrations of SFN and DBM
in treated Apc Min/+ mice. LC/MS analysis indicated a dosedependent plasma and tissue concentrations of SFN and DBM in
Apc Min/+ mice. As shown in Table 2, mean plasma concentration of
SFN in 600 ppm–treated group was 68 ng/mL (0.384 Amol/L),
which is about twice of that in the 300 ppm treatment group.
The concentration of SFN-GSH, which is the major metabolite of
SFN, was 347 ng/mL (0.717 Amol/L) and 274 ng/mL (0.566 Amol/L)
in the 600 and 300 ppm group, respectively. Mean plasma
concentration of DBM was 145 ng/mL (0.647 Amol/L) and 338
ng/mL (1.509 Amol/L) in the combinatorial and 1.0% treatment
group, respectively. In small intestine, mean tissue concentration of
SFN was 0.8 and 2.7 ng/mg protein in combinatorial treatment
and 600 ppm group, respectively; therefore, in small intestine,

www.aacrjournals.org

concentrations of SFN were also lower than concentrations of
its metabolite SFN-GSH (6.8 and 15.5 ng/mg protein in 300 and
600 ppm group, respectively). Mean tissue concentration of DBM
was 198 ng/mg protein in combination group and 424 ng/mg
protein in 1.0% group, which were much higher than concentrations of SFN and SFN-GSH in the tissue.
Effects of dietary administration of SFN and/or DBM on
arachidonic acid metabolism. As shown in Fig. 2A and B,
arachidonic acid metabolism pathway metabolites PGE2 and LTB4
levels were elevated significantly in intestinal polyps comparing
with that in the normal-appearing mucosa (normal mucosa). Ten
weeks of dietary administration of SFN alone at 600 ppm resulted
in a slightly increase of PGE2 levels in both intestinal polyps and
normal mucosa but strongly decreased the level of LTB4 in both
type of tissues. Dietary administration of DBM alone dramatically
decreased both PGE2 and LTB4 in intestinal tumors. DBM treatment also decreased PGE2 level dramatically in normal mucosa,
whereas LTB4 level was inhibited to a much less extent in normal
mucosa. Combinatorial treatment with half dose of SFN and DBM
achieved similar inhibition effects on PGE2 and LTB4 levels as the
DBM 1% treatment.
COX-2 expression level was also much higher in intestinal polyps
than that in the normal-appearing mucosa (Fig. 2C). Coordinate
with the down-regulation of PGE2 levels in small intestine, the
expression of COX-2 was also strongly inhibited by DBM treatments. Although SFN alone did not change PGE2 levels significantly, the expression of COX-2 was slightly inhibited by SFN
treatment. Whereas LTB4 levels were significantly decreased by
both SFN and DBM treatments in tumor and normal mucosa, the
expression of 5-LOX was almost unaffected by both treatments.
Dietary administration of SFN and DBM significantly
altered phosphorylation of Akt and MAPKs. As shown in
Fig. 3A, the basal phosphorylation level of Akt at Ser473 was higher
in the polyps than that in the normal-appearing mucosa. Longterm treatment of SFN, DBM, or in combination significantly
down-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in polyps,
and the inhibition was more significant in the normal-appearing
mucosa. However, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation did not
disturb the h-catenin signaling pathway, which is downstream of
Akt pathway, as evidenced by the unchanged expression level of
h-catenin, E-cadherin, and the phosphorylation of glycogen
synthase kinase 3h kinase (data not shown) by all treatments.
Interestingly, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) 2 (42 kDa) was inhibited by treatments in polyps
but not in normal-appearing mucosa. Similarly, c-Jun NH2-terminal

kinases (JNK) were inhibited in polyps but slightly activated in
normal-appearing mucosa. The phosphorylation of p38 was not
changed by SFN treatment in both tissues but was activated by
DBM treatment in the polyps. The combination of SFN and DBM
decreased the expression of phosphorylated p38 in normal mucosa.
Dietary administration of SFN and DBM significantly altered
proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
SFN treatment significantly increased the expression of cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21 in polyps but to a less extent in
normal mucosa (Fig. 3B). The decreased induction of p21 in the
combination group by SFN might be explained by the fact that
DBM treatment alone slightly inhibited the expression of p21 in
both polyps and normal mucosa. DBM treatment dramatically
decreased the expression of cyclin D1, whereas SFN treatment
increased the expression of cyclin D1. SFN treatment alone strongly
activated caspase-3 and caspase-7; interestingly, activation of
caspase-3 by SFN only occurred in intestinal polyps but not in
normal mucosa. Both SFN and DBM treatments strongly induce
the expression of Bax. These observations were further supported
by PCNA staining and in situ apoptosis detection assay. Percentage
of PCNA-positive cells, representing cells under proliferation, was
significantly reduced in the treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
In contrast, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly
increased in mice treated with SFN alone or in combination with
DBM using ApopTag In situ Apoptosis Detection kit, although the
increased level was not significant after DBM treatment alone
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Quantitative real-time PCR validation of microarray data.
Nine genes from different categories (Supplementary Table S1)
were selected to confirm the microarray data using quantitative
real-time PCR analyses. Expression values for each gene were
normalized by the values of corresponding GAPDH gene in the
same sample and the ratios of treated/control were calculated. The
value of expression change of each gene obtained in microarray
analysis correlated very well to those obtained from real-time PCR
assay (Supplementary Table S1) as verified by the Spearman
correlation (r 2 = 0.957; Fig. 4).
Gene expression profiles in tumor and normal-appearing
mucosa after DBM and SFN treatment. Using GeneSpring
software, lists of genes that were induced or inhibited >2-fold by
treatment both in intestinal polyps and normal-appearing mucosa
were identified (Supplementary Table S2). Among these genes,
glutathione metabolism-related genes, such as glutamate-cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) and modifier subunit (Gclm),
glutathione S-transferases (GST; Gsta and Gstm), glutathione
synthetase (Gss), and glutathione reductase 1 (Gsr), were all highly
induced by all treatments in both tumor and normal-appearing
mucosa. Interestingly, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) genes were

inhibited by the treatments. Several other antioxidant and phase II
detoxification genes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), microsomal
epoxide hydrolase 1 (Ephx1), thioredoxin reductases (Txnrd), and
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Ugt2b5) were also induced highly by
treatments in normal-appearing mucosa and a to less extent in
intestinal tumors. DBM alone or in combination with SFN
dramatically induce the expression of many cytochrome P450
genes in apparently normal mucosa and to a lesser extent in
intestinal polyps. In addition to these drug metabolism and
detoxification genes, all treatments also altered the expression of
genes involved in cell proliferation and signal transduction. For
example, Eph receptors were differentially regulated by both
treatments in tumor and normal-appearing mucosa. Many
cytokines or cytokine signaling pathway-related genes, such as
interleukins (Il), insulin (Insl5), and insulin-like growth factor
binding proteins (Igfbp), were suppressed in treated tumor and
normal-appearing mucosa. Wnt signaling pathway-related gene
WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (Wisp1) was also
suppressed by both treatments. In addition to genes regulated by
both SFN and DBM, cluster of genes specifically regulated by each
compound were also identified. As shown in Supplementary Table
S2, chemokine ligand (Cxcl) gene expression was suppressed by
DBM treatment, whereas expression of chemokine receptor genes
(Ccr) was only inhibited by SFN treatment. DBM alone or in
combination also strongly inhibited the expression of colon cancer
biomarker clusterin gene (Clu) in the normal-appearing mucosa.
Many isoforms of G protein–coupled receptors (Gpr) were also
down-regulated by DBM treatments. Among the kinase genes being
regulated, SFN treatment specifically inhibited the expression of
p21-activated kinase 2 and 3 (Pak2 and Pak3), whereas many
MAPKs (Map2k6, Map2k7, Map3k1, and Map4k1) and protein
kinase C genes (Prkc) were regulated by DBM-related treatment.

Discussion
Dietary consumption of SFN for 3 weeks at doses of 300 and
600 ppm resulted in significant inhibition of intestinal polyposis by
25% and 48% in the Apc Min/+ mouse model in our previous study
(5). In this study, long-term (10 weeks) dietary consumption of SFN
at dose of 600 ppm also achieved 50% tumor growth inhibition,
indicating that longer and earlier treatment with SFN did not
improve its colon cancer chemopreventive effects in Apc Min/+ mice.
Consumption of DBM at dose of 1.0% in the diet resulted in 50%
intestinal tumor growth inhibition in this study. This is the first
time to show that DBM has colon cancer chemopreventive effect
in vivo. Under current experimental conditions, each mouse (body
weight, f20 g) consumed f3 g of diet daily; therefore,
consumption of SFN at dose of 600 ppm and DBM at dose of

Colon Tumor Prevention by SFN and DBM

1.0% in diets was equivalent to a daily dose of 90 mg/kg for SFN
and 1,500 mg/kg for DBM. Because 50% of tumor growth inhibition
is generally considered to be effective in cancer chemotherapy or
chemopreventive studies in animal models, the above doses
actually could be considered as the minimum efficacious dose for
SFN and DBM because 50% intestinal tumor growth inhibition
was both achieved. Comparing their minimum efficacious doses
also suggested that SFN is a much more potent colon cancer chemopreventive agent than DBM in this model. Although combination
treatment with only half dose of SFN and DBM (300 ppm and 0.5%,
respectively) also resulted in a potent inhibition of intestinal
polyposis (57% inhibition), the improvement of efficacy by
combinatorial treatment is not statistically different from the
individual treatments. Therefore, whether the combinatorial effect
of SFN and DBM on intestinal tumor growth is additive or synergistic
can only be characterized by individual and combination treatments
of SFN and DBM at more dose levels. Although the inhibitory effect
of combinatorial treatment is not statistically higher than that of the
individual treatments, it still suggests the feasibility of achieving
similar or even stronger anticancer effects using lower-dose
combination of SFN or DBM. This might be an important and

practical approach in clinical treatments when a high dose of single
chemopreventive agent is not feasible to achieve. As supported by
LC/MS drug concentration analysis, the combinatorial treatment
group achieved higher tumor inhibition effect with much lower
plasma and tissue concentrations of SFN and DBM than that in the
individual treatment groups.
PGE2 and LTB4 are two major metabolites generated from
arachidonic acid metabolism via COX-dependent and 5-LOX–
dependent pathways. Increased production of PGE2 was found in
the intestinal adenomas of FAP patients and in colon cancer tissues
(13). PGE2 levels were also found to be increased f2-fold in
intestinal polyps compared with that in normal-appearing mucosa
in this study. A previous report suggested that increased PGE2 level
generated by COX-2 up-regulation could accelerate the intestinal
polyposis through activation of prostaglandin receptor EP2mediated cellular events (14). Several other studies also suggested
that PGE2 promotes colon carcinoma growth and invasion through
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling or by activation
of a Ras-MAPK signaling cascades (15, 16). In this study, the downregulation of PGE2 levels in both apparently normal mucosa and
intestinal polyps by DBM and combination treatment was

metabolism in both intestinal tumors and normal-appearing mucosa of Apc Min/+ mice. A, both DBM and combinatorial treatments significantly decreased PGE2 levels
in intestinal tumors and normal-appearing mucosa, whereas SFN treatment increased the level of PGE2 slightly. B, LTB4 levels were significantly decreased by
all treatments and in a much more extent in the intestinal tumors than in the normal-appearing mucosa. C, decreased intestinal PGE2 and LTB4 levels were associated
with down-regulation of COX-2 but not 5-LOX enzyme expression.

correlated with the inhibition of COX-2 expression. Furthermore,
the down-regulation of genes involved in PI3K/Akt pathway (such
as Pik3ap1, Pik3ca, and Pik3cg ) and Ras signaling pathways (Rab14,
Rab30, Rab38, and Rit2) shown by microarray analysis strongly
suggests that DBM and in combination with SFN can inhibit
intestinal tumorigenesis by inhibiting the COX-2/PGE2–mediated
multiple signaling pathways. Down-regulation of LTB4 levels
by both DBM and SFN treatments may also contribute to their
antitumorigenesis because LTB4 could stimulate proliferation of
human colon carcinoma cells in vitro (17, 18) and its concentration
in tumors was found to be 3-fold of that in apparently normal
mucosa in this study. Surprisingly, the 5-LOX expression was
almost unaffected by all treatments. However, both DBM and

combination treatment strongly induced the LTB4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (Ltb4dh) gene in both polyps and apparently normal
mucosa, which is the key enzyme to metabolize LTB4 (19), and
increased expression of this enzyme can result in decreased level
of LTB4 in vivo. This result is also consistent with recent reports
that many cancer chemopreventive reagent can induce the metabolism of LTB4 (20). Furthermore, the strong induction of cytochrome P450 genes and epoxide hydrolases (Ephx1 and Ephx2) by
both SFN and DBM treatments may shift the arachidonic acid
metabolism more toward the epoxygenase pathway that forms
the epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and dihydroxyacids, which will also
result in decreased level of both PGE2 and LTB4. On the other
hand, the induction of many phase II detoxification (GST) and

antioxidant genes (HO-1, Ephx1, Txnrd, etc.) by both SFN and DBM
treatment will increase the cellular defense mechanisms against
electrophiles, reactive oxygen species, or inflammatory mediators,
including those generated during arachidonic acid metabolism or
lipid peroxidation process. The decreased cellular oxidative stress
by SFN and DBM through the above mechanism may create a
microenvironment that can slow or inhibit the development of
intestinal polyps from normal-appearing mucosa cells with genetic
Apc mutation in this animal model.
Mutation of Apc gene in Apc Min/+ mouse leads to the
dysregulation of Wnt signaling pathway, which is responsible
for the development of multiple intestinal neoplasia in this model
(21). Down-regulation of this pathway by increasing the
expression of E-cadherin to decrease nuclear h-catenin level
was suggested as one of the cancer chemopreventive mechanisms
of ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in this model (11). However,
both SFN and DBM treatments did not change the level of
E-cadherin in both polyps and apparently normal mucosa nor did
the h-catenin level in nucleus (data not shown). This result
suggests that inhibition of intestinal polyposis in Apc Min/+ by SFN
and DBM may not through the regulation of nuclear h-catenin
level. On the other hand, Akt kinase, which is a downstream
target of numerous receptor tyrosine kinases and showed
elevated phosphorylation at Ser473 in polyps compared with that
in apparently normal mucosa in this study, was strongly inhibited
by both SFN and DBM treatments. In agreement with this event,
several PI3K-related genes (Pik3ap1, Pik3ca, Pik3cg, and Pik3c2a)
were down-regulated by SFN and/or DBM treatments as shown
by microarray analysis. Genetic abrogation of c-Jun NH2-terminal
phosphorylation or gut-specific conditional c-Jun inactivation
reduced tumor number/size and prolonged life span in Apc Min/+

mice. As the JNK and Apc/h-catenin pathways were viewed as
two distinct pathways activated by Wnt signal transduction (22),
the specific inhibition of JNK by SFN and DBM in intestinal
tumor might be the result of down-regulation of Wnt signaling
pathway without affecting the h-catenin pathway. Furthermore,
the inhibition of cell proliferation and growth-related ERK1/2 by
both DBM and SFN treatments might also contribute to their
tumor inhibitory effects.
Both SFN and DBM could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in various cancer cells (9, 23, 24). In this study, SFN strongly
induced the expression of p21, which is in accordance with our
previous studies (10, 25). Interestingly, DBM strongly inhibited
cyclin D1 expression but did not induce p21, suggesting distinct
mechanisms and potentially synergistic effects between these two
compounds in regulating cell growth. Immunohistochemical
results also showed that both SFN and DBM could inhibit the
expression of PCNA in intestinal polyps, and stronger inhibition
was also observed in the combination treatment. SFN treatment
also resulted in the activation of caspases, including caspase-7 and
caspase-3, whereas DBM treatment has lesser effect in inducing
apoptosis. It is interesting to point out that caspase-3 was only
activated in the intestinal polyps but not in apparently normal
mucosa, suggesting induction of tissue-specific apoptotic effect by
SFN. The efficacy of both compounds to induce cell apoptosis was
further verified by in situ apoptosis detection assay. All these
observations suggested that SFN and DBM may exert its cancer
chemoprevention effects through induction of cell cycle arrest and/
or apoptosis.
In summary, the present study shows for the first time that
dietary administration of SFN and DBM alone or in combination
significantly suppressed colorectal tumorigenesis in the Apc Min/+
mice model. We also showed that their cancer chemopreventive
effects may involve mechanisms including alteration of arachidonic acid metabolism, inhibition of cellular survival signaling
pathway such as Akt and MAPKs, and induction of cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis. The gene expression profiles elicited by
these treatments further support these potential mechanisms
and provide new molecular insights on their in vivo pharmacologic effects. Taken together, our results suggest that the
combination of these relatively nontoxic and low-cost dietary
phytochemical compounds will be beneficial in preventing common malignancies, such as colorectal cancers, particularly in highrisk FAP patients.
