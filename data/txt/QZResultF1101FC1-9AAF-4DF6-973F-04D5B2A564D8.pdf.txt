Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Regulators of mitosis have been successfully targeted to enhance response to taxane
chemotherapy. Here, we show that the Salt Inducible Kinase 2 (SIK2) localizes at the centrosome,
plays a key role in the initiation of mitosis and regulates the localization of the centrosome linker
protein, C-Nap1, through S2392 phosphorylation. Interference with the known SIK2 inhibitor
PKA induced SIK2-dependent centrosome splitting in interphase while SIK2 depletion blocked
centrosome separation in mitosis, sensitizing ovarian cancers to paclitaxel in culture and in
xenografts. Depletion of SIK2 also delayed G1/S transition and reduced AKT phosphorylation.
Higher expression of SIK2 significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with high-grade

serous ovarian cancers. These data identify SIK2 as a plausible target for therapy in ovarian

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Uncontrolled mitosis is a distinguishing feature of cancer cells that has been effectively
exploited for cancer therapy using anti-tubulin drugs such as paclitaxel. The use of primary
paclitaxel-based combination chemotherapy increases progression free survival and overall
survival in hematological and solid malignancies including ovarian cancer (Martin et al.,
2008; McGuire et al., 1996). While high grade serous ovarian cancers are known to be
highly chemosensitive, a significant proportion of these cancers fail to respond to primary
taxane therapy leading to the emergence of resistant disease. There is a pressing need for the
discovery of synergistic therapies that may improve ovarian cancer response to taxane-based
chemotherapy and overall prognosis. Currently available mechanisms for selective
enhancement of taxane response, such as the use of kinesin motor inhibitors or the inhibition
of mitotic exit, are focused on targeting cancer cells only in mitosis (Huang et al., 2009;
Mayer et al., 1999). While such strategies have shown clinical promise, overall tumor
response rates have been limited (Blagden et al., 2008; Gautschi et al., 2008; Lin et al.,
2008; Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006). Novel therapeutic targets that augment taxane effects in
inhibiting mitosis while providing taxane- and mitosis-independent mechanisms of cancer
cell death are needed to improve clinical chemotherapy response. In this work we conducted
an siRNA-based screen to identify modulators of mitotic progression that may influence
clinical paclitaxel response.

Results
A high content siRNA kinome screen identifies cell cycle regulators of ovarian cancer cells
Recent evidence suggests that delayed mitotic progression or the inhibition of mitotic exit
are key predictors of cell death either with or without taxane treatment (Bekier et al., 2009;
Huang et al., 2009). To identify regulators of mitotic progression in ovarian cancer cells that
may modulate taxane response, we used a three-step approach: 1) we screened 779 pools of
siRNAs (Dharmacon kinome library) targeting individual genes to identify potential
regulators of the G2 or the M phases (G2/M) of the cell cycle, 2) several hits were selected
for further validation using individual siRNAs that made up the pool used in the primary
screen and finally, 3) time-lapse microscopy was used to identify specific regulators of
mitotic progression that were then tested for synergistic interactions with paclitaxel.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The primary screen utilized automated image acquisition and morphometric analysis of
fixed cells in 384-well plates (high content analysis, Figure 1A) to measure single-cell DNA
content following siRNA treatment. The integrated nuclear intensity values (defined as the
nuclear area multiplied by its mean pixel intensity) were calculated as a measure for DNA
content and used to generate cell cycle histograms following the knockdown (KD) of each
of the 779 genes included in the screen. The percentage of shift of the median integrated
nuclear intensity value following a gene KD compared to that following transfection using
non-targeting siRNA was calculated and termed the ploidy index (Figure 1 B–E and
Supplementary Table S1). Genes that upon KD induced a percentage shift (ploidy index)
that was above the median and 2 standard deviations of all genes in a plate were identified as
positive hits for further validation (Figure 1G and Supplementary Table S2). There was a
high correlation between the ploidy indices across triplicate plates (median correlation
coefficient =0.74) and a mean coefficient of repeatability for all genes tested of 0.1,
indicating high data precision in the screen (Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure S1A and
Supplementary Table S1). The identified hits included many genes that have been

previously shown to regulate G2 or M phases of cell cycle progression such as Cyclin
Dependent Kinase 1 (CDC2) and Polo Kinase 1 (PLK1) (Supplementary Table S2). The
magnitude of ploidy shift varied according to the mechanism of G2/M regulation by a gene
rather than the biological importance. For example, depletion of Aurora Kinase B (AURKB)
resulted in cytokinesis failure and a profound increase in the ploidy index. In contrast,
depletion of the centrosome kinase phosphotyrosine picked threonine kinase 1 (MPS1, also
called TTK) resulted in a modest increase in ploidy that presumably reflects delayed mitotic
transition (Supplementary Tables S1–S3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Among the identified hits, 7 were selected for further validation based on their potential
novelty (Figure 1 H). To exclude off-target effects we used 4 individual siRNAs that made
up the siRNA pool that was used in the primary screen to KD each gene and compared the
percentage of tetraploid cells following genetic KD with the percentage following
transfection with a non-targeting siRNA control. As a positive control for tetraploidy we
used; 1) paclitaxel treated non-transfected cells and 2) KD of the chromosome passenger
protein Borealin (CDCA8), which plays a critical role in cytokinesis. Six of the seven genes
were validated with at least 2 independent siRNAs, which resulted in a significant increase
in tetraploidy (p<0.05, Wilcoxon test, Figure 1H). Only one of the 4 siRNAs targeting the
Eukaryotic Elongation Factor-2 Kinase (EEF2K) resulted in increased tetraploidy indicating
an off-target effect. Interestingly, this siRNA had a perfect sequence match to EEF2K and
also 70% sequence match to Borealin.
The 6 validated targets may be involved in the regulation of G2, mitosis or both. To
determine specific regulators of mitosis we used bright field microscopy and time lapse
imaging to identify targets that lead to delayed mitotic progression. To demonstrate the
opposite effect, we used KD of the mitotic checkpoint protein BUBR1 and, as expected, this
resulted in rapid mitotic progression (mean = 20 minutes following KD of BUBR1 compared
to 58 minutes in controls, n= 10, p<0.01; Supplementary Movies Smov1 and Smov2). In
contrast, depletion of SIK2, Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 Interacting Protein (CINP) or CDK5
Regulatory Subunit 1 (CDK5R1) resulted in a significant delay in mitotic progression
followed by mitotic exit without cell division (Supplementary Movie Smov3 and other data
not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The finding that SIK2 may play a role in regulating mitosis was intriguing since its
established functional role has been in the regulation of cellular metabolism but not the cell
cycle (Dentin et al., 2007; Katoh et al., 2004; Screaton et al., 2004). We have previously
shown that KD of the Drosophila orthologues of Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 (STK11, also
called LKB1), a known SIK2 kinase, and SIK3, an immediate family member of SIK2 results
in severe mitotic abnormalities (Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004). We, therefore, selected SIK2
for further validation. Time-lapse photography showed that loss of SIK2 resulted in a
dramatic increase in the mean mitotic progression time (62 minutes in control cells
transfected with non-targeting siRNA v 133, 209 and 172 minutes following SIK2 KD using
three siRNAs, p<0.001, One-Way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test [Figure
2A–D]). Importantly many of the SIK2 depleted cells either did not exit mitosis during the
time of recording, ruptured or failed to undergo cytokinesis (Supplementary Movie Smov3
and additional data not shown).
Depletion of SIK2 sensitizes ovarian cancers to paclitaxel
As depletion of SIK2 resulted in protracted mitotic progression time, we tested the
hypothesis that this may sensitize ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel. Transfection with SIK2
siRNA decreased the dose of paclitaxel required to reduce cancer cell growth by 50 % (GI
50) from 4.8 nM (95% confidence interval [CI]; 2.7–8.4 nM) in control-transfected cells to
1.4 nM (95% CI; 0.6–3.2 nM), 0.17 nM (95% CI; 0.05–0.6 nM) or 0.36 nM (95% CI; 0.01–

0.1 nM) for SIK2 siRNAs A, B and C, respectively (Figure 2E). Importantly, this effect was
not cell-specific as SIK2 KD significantly decreased paclitaxel GI 50 in Hey cells (from 7.8
nM for control siRNA to 2.3 nM for SIK2 siRNA), ES2 cells (from 6.7 nM for control
siRNA to 3.3 nM for SIK2 siRNA) and 2008 cells (from 0.67 nM for control siRNA to 0.47
nM for SIK2 siRNA) ([Figure 2F]), indicating that selective depletion of SIK2 is sufficient to
sensitize ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel in vitro.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the biological significance of SIK2 in ovarian cancer we first examined its expression
pattern in 59 ovarian cancers and 9 pools of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells using
quantitative PCR. The range of expression of SIK2 was narrow suggesting that a large
number of cases was required to identify a correlation between SIK2 expression and clinical
outcome (data not shown). The importance of SIK2 in regulating mitosis and paclitaxel
response was supported by the analysis of SIK2 expression in 229 patients with high-grade
serous (HGS) ovarian cancers in a population-based study (Tothill et al., 2008). Higher
expression of SIK2 significantly increased the hazard of cancer progression following
taxane-based chemotherapy using the two independent affymetrix microarray probe sets that
were found to accurately represent SIK2 expression (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure
S2A). These results were validated using quantitative PCR (Supplementary Figure S2B). In
addition, the level of SIK2 microarray expression in paclitaxel or carboplatin resistant
ovarian cancers was compared to that in paclitaxel or carboplatin responders in a prospective
randomized clinical trial in which patients with primary ovarian cancer were treated initially
with either single agent paclitaxel or single agent carboplatin for three cycles (Ahmed et al.,
2007). SIK2 expression was significantly higher in paclitaxel resistant compared to
paclitaxel-sensitive cancers (p=0.028, one-sided t-test, n=20, Supplementary Figure S2C). In
contrast, no significant difference was found in SIK2 expression between carboplatin
resistant or carboplatin sensitive cancers (p=0.7, one-sided t-test, n=15, Supplementary
Figure S2C). All together these data support an important role of SIK2 in the regulation of
mitosis and taxane response in cell culture and in ovarian cancer patients.
SIK2 localizes at the centrosome

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate a possible physical association between SIK2 and the mitotic spindle, we
examined SIK2’s subcellular localization using immunofluorescence (IF). As previously
described, endogenous SIK2 was observed in the cytoplasm (Katoh et al., 2004). In addition,
SIK2 co-localized with γ-tubulin in the centrosomes of 70 % of cells in interphase and in all
cells in mitosis and co-immunoprecipitated with γ-tubulin (Figure 3A and Supplementary
Figure S3A). Preincubation of the SIK2 antibody with recombinant SIK2 protein, but not
with control proteins (BSA or recombinant histone H1), abolished the centrosome signal of
SIK2 on IF (Supplementary Figure S3B). Further confirmation of specificity was achieved
by showing that KD of SIK2 resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of cells with
detectable SIK2 in the centrosome using immunofluorescence (p<0.001, t test;
Supplementary Figure S3C). The expression of SIK2 was predominantly pericentriolar as
evidenced by immunostaining of Hela cells that stably expressed GFP-tagged centrin
(Supplementary Figure S3D) and was independent of microtubules since it colocalized with
γ-tubulin following nocodazole treatment (data not shown). The observation that
endogenous SIK2 localized at centrosomes was further supported by showing that
exogenous myc/flag-tagged SIK2 localized to the centrosomes of 50% of the cells examined
(Figure 3B). In addition, differential centrosome localization was also observed following
transfection using the untagged version of the SIK2 plasmid and detection using anti-SIK2
antibody (p<0.001, paired t test [Supplementary Figure S3E–H]). All together these results
confirm that a pool of SIK2 localizes at the centrosome.

SIK2 induces centrosome splitting

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next tested the functional role of SIK2 in the centrosomes. Examination of the
centrosomes in interphase cells transfected with a myc/flag-SIK2 expression construct
revealed a significant increase in the percentage of myc-positive cells with centrosome
splitting (CS) compared to the percentage in myc-negative cells or cells transfected with
empty vectors (21.3, 5 and 3.9, respectively; p<0.001, one-way ANOVA, Figure 4A–C).
This effect was not due to failure of reengagement following disengagement which is known
to occur in late mitosis to license for centriole duplication (Tsou and Stearns, 2006) as in
SKOv3 cells disengaging centrioles only separate by submicrometre distances
(Supplementary Figure S4A–G). SIK2-induced CS was dependent on its kinase activity
since overexpression of a kinase-inactive SIK2 mutant (SIK2_mt; K49M) (Katoh et al.,
2006) did not result in an increase in the percentage of cells with CS (Figure 4B–C). The
effect of wild type SIK2 in inducing CS was similar to the reported phenotype that is
observed following the overexpression of NEK2 but less in magnitude (3.9% in control cells
v 21.3% in SIK2-positive cells and 50.9% in NEK2-positive cells, p<0.001, Figure 4B–C).
Similar results were observed in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, a cell line that is
commonly used to study this phenotype (4, 29 and 55 for cells transfected with empty
vector, SIK2-myc/flag and NEK2-myc/flag, respectively; p<0.001, one-way ANOVA;
Figure 4C). As the metabolic function of SIK2 is activated following LKB1-induced
phosphorylation, we tested the effect of co-expression of SIK2 and LKB1 on CS. LKB1 did
not increase the percentage of cells with CS above what is already achieved by SIK2 alone
(Supplementary Figure S4H). This implies that the activity of SIK2 in inducing centrosome
splitting is independent of LKB1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next took an unbiased approach to identify possible targets for SIK2 phosphorylation in
the centrosome. Searching the Swiss-PROT database for human proteins that contains the
previously identified putative SIK2 phosphorylation consensus sequence LX[HKR]S/
TXSXXXL (Screaton et al., 2004), identified the peptide LHHSLSHSLL in the carboxyterminal domain (amino acids: 2387–2396) of the centrosome protein CEP250 (also called
C-Nap1) as a putative phosphorylation site. C-Nap1 is thought to be one of the key proteins
that are required for centrosome cohesion in interphase and its centrosome localization is
predominantly regulated by phosphorylation (Fry et al., 1998a; Mayor et al., 2002).
Importantly, phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal part of C-Nap1 by ectopically
expressed NEK2 results in premature exit of C-Nap1 from the centrosome and CS (Fry et
al., 1998a; Fry et al., 1998b; Mayor et al., 2002). Recombinant SIK2 directly phosphorylated
a 15 amino-acid peptide derived from C-Nap1 that contained the putative SIK2
phosphorylation site at the underlined serine amino acids (LAGLHHSLSHSLLAV) in vitro
as shown by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), data not shown. In
addition, SIK2 catalyzed the incorporation of radioactive γ-32p-ATP into recombinant GSTtagged carboxy-terminal C-Nap1 (GST-C-Nap1-ct, aa; 1982–2442; 461 amino acids), but
not GST alone (Figure 4D). Remarkably, LC-MS confirmed that the predominant serine
phosphorylation site of the recombinant carboxy-terminal domain of C-Nap1 is S2392 at the
predicted consensus phosphorylation sequence and to a lesser extent S2394
(LHHSLSHSLL). Importantly, SIK2 phosphoylation of carboxy-terminal C-Nap1 appeared
highly specific as the peptide LHHSLSHSLL was the predominant site of serine
phosphorylation in addition to a second site (S2234) at the fifth potential coiled coil region
of C-Nap1 (Figure 4E). We next expressed a protein A-tagged version of the
carboxyterminal domain of C-Nap1 in 293-T cells, which are known for their high
transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation using rabbit IgG-coated beads of protein Atagged carboxy-terminal C-Nap1 but not protein A alone co-precipitated endogenous SIK2
(Figure 4F) indicating that direct binding between SIK2 and exogenously expressed
carboxy-terminal part of C-Nap1 occurs in cells. In addition, endogenous SIK2 partially co-

localized with ectopically expressed C-Nap1 in the centrosome of SKOv3 cells
(Supplementary Figure S4I). Co-expression of full length C-Nap1 with the kinase active
SIK2 in 293-T cells resulted in the phosphorylation of C-Nap1 as detected by C-Nap1
immunoprecipitation followed by probing using anti-phosphoserine antibody. In contrast
expression of the kinase mutant SIK2 did not result in phosphorylation of the co-expressed
C-Nap1 (Figure 4G). We next investigated whether SIK2 displaces C-Nap1 from the
centrosomes. IF confirmed the localization of endogenous C-Nap1 at the centrosomes of
ovarian cancer cells and, in addition, showed that there was variability in the centrosome
expression level (Supplementary Figure S4J). Knockdown of C-Nap1 rsulted in a 10 fold
increase in SKOv3 cells with centrosome splitting (Supplementary Figure S4K). High
content analysis of C-Nap1 in untransfected cells showed that its centrosome localization
significantly increases in G2 compared to G1/S (p<0.001, t test, Figure 4H). In addition, the
percentage of cells in which the centrosome expression of C-Nap1 was below the automated
threshold of detection decreased from 22% in G1/S to 13% in G2. We next examined the
effect of SIK2 transfection on the centrosome localization of C-Nap1 (Figure 4I). SIK2
transfection resulted in a modest but significant increase of the percentage of cells with
undetectable C-Nap1 signal in G1 (22% in SIK2 negative, 27.2% in SIK2 positive, p<0.001,
Chi square test, n=3376, Figure 4J). However, in G2, SIK2 expression resulted in a greater
magnitude of C-Nap1 displacement (14.5% in SIK2 negative cells to 29.4% in SIK2 positive
cells; p=0.004; Chi square test, n= 340, Figure 4J). In contrast, expression of a kinase
inactive SIK2 did not increase the percentage of cells with undetectable C-Nap1 signal in
G1/S or in G2 (Figure 4J). These results implicate C-Nap1 as a putative downstream target
for SIK2 at the centrosome.

SIK2 is required for centrosome separation in mitosis As ectopic expression of SIK2
resulted in CS, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous SIK2 was required for centrosome
separation in mitosis. Interestingly, in interphase, depletion of SIK2 resulted in uncoupling
of the centrosomes from the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S5A–B). Importantly, cotransfection of SKOv3 cells with siRNA targeting the 3’UTR of SIK2 and a construct
expressing the open reading frame of SIK2 completely rescued this phenotype
(Supplementary Figure S5C). Inducing a wound in a confluent monolayer of SKOv3 cells
following control siRNA transfection oriented the centrosomes towards the leading edge of
the cell. In contrast, cells depleted from SIK2 failed to orient their centrosomes towards the
leading edge in spite of the formation of lamellipodia (Supplementary Figure S5D–E). These
results further support the notion of a centrosome-specific function of SIK2. In mitosis,
depletion of SIK2 resulted in the accumulation of cells in prometaphase within 48 hr of
transfection (p<0.01, t-test; Figure 5A–B). Importantly, this mitotic defect was not because
of depletion of energy reserves as knockdown of SIK2 did not decrease cellular ATP content
(Supplementary Figure S5F). There was a significant increase in the ratio of prometaphase
to metaphase cells following SIK2 KD (2.1 in controls and 8.3 following SIK2 KD; Figure
5C). These results were confirmed in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line (Figure 5D). The
block in prometaphase was due to failure of SIK2-depleted cells to form bipolar mitotic cells
(p<0.001, Oneway ANOVA; Figure 5A and Figure 5E). Importantly, the role of SIK2 in
regulating centrosome separation in mitosis was evolutionarily conserved, as depletion of
the orthologue of SIK2 in Drosophila (CG4290) in DMEL cells resulted in a significant
increase in mitotic cells with defects in centrosome separation (p<0.01, t-test; Figure 5F–G).
Thus, SIK2 is required for appropriate centrosome positioning in interphase and for
centrosome separation in mitosis.
PRKAR2A inhibits SIK2 in the centrosome
We next investigated the mechanisms regulating SIK2 activity in the centrosome. The
metabolic function of SIK2 in the cytoplasm is under inhibitory control by PKA (Katoh et

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 March 14.

al., 2004). Interestingly, the regulatory subunit of PKA, PRKAR2A, is tethered at the
centrosome and the pericentriolar region of interphase cells by the anchoring protein
AKAP450 (Carlson et al., 2001; Landsverk et al., 2001). In mitosis, CDC2 phosphorylates
PRKAR2A resulting in its displacement from the centrosome (Carlson et al., 2001).
Consistent with previous observations, we found that PRKAR2A localized to the
centrosomes of SKOv3 cells in interphase. In addition, PRKAR2A disappeared from the
centrosome early in prophase and this coincided with centrosome separation and a
significant increase in the centrosome level of SIK2 and γ-tubulin (p<0.001, One-way
ANOVA, Supplementary Figure S6A–F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The centrosome localization of PRKAR2A was required for maintaining centrosome pairing
since its depletion in SKOv3 cells resulted in 11.6 fold increase in interphase cells with
centrosome splitting compared to control siRNA transfected cells (9.3% and 0.8%
respectively; p<0.001, t-test [Supplementary Figure S6G]). To target the centrosome
localization of PRKAR2A without interfering with its cytoplasmic level we depleted
AKAP450 in SKOv3 cells (Figure 6A). This depletion abolished the centrosome localization
of PRKAR2A but not that of SIK2 (Supplementary Figure S6H) and resulted in a significant
increase in cells with centrosome splitting (CS) (10.8% in AKAP450 depleted cells v 1.3%
in controls; p<0.001, One-way ANOVA [Figure 6B]). Similar results were obtained using 2
other AKAP450 siRNAs, not shown, Importantly, the increase in CS was dependent on SIK2
since co-transfection of SKOv3 cells with siRNAs targeting SIK2 and AKAP450 rescued the
phenotype (Figure 6B). Thus PRKAR2A is required for preventing SIK2 from inducing CS
in interphase and may play a key role in regulating the appropriate timing of centrosome
separation early in mitosis
SIK2 is required for AKT phosphorylation and growth of ovarian cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next investigated the effect of SIK2 depletion on cancer cell growth independent from
paclitaxel. Depletion of SIK2 in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines SKOv3, ES2 and Hey
resulted in a significant decrease in cancer cell proliferation (Figure 7A, p<0.001, t-test). To
investigate the mechanism of suppression of proliferation we tested the effect of depletion of
SIK2 on the cell cycle with or without synchronization. Cell cycle analysis using flow
cytometry of non-synchronized population of SKOv3 cells following depletion of SIK2
confirmed the accumulation of tetraploid cells (Figure 7B). However, synchronization of
cells in G2/M using paclitaxel treatment following SIK2 depletion showed that a significant
proportion of cells were delayed in G1 (Figure 7B) and failed to enter mitosis as indicated
by the significant decrease in mitotic index following paclitaxel treatment (p<0.001, OneWay ANOVA; Figure 7C). This data indicated that loss of SIK2 results in defective G1/S
transition in addition to delayed mitotic progression and that both may contribute to
suppression of ovarian cancer cell proliferation. To investigate the molecular profile
underlying delayed G1/S transition we investigated the effect of SIK2 depletion on the
expression of 139 proteins using reverse phase protein arrays. Depletion of SIK2 resulted in
a significant decrease in AKT phosphorylation at amino acid 473 without significantly
influencing total AKT expression (Figure 7D). We next examined the effect of SIK2
depletion using 3 independent siRNAs in 3 ovarian cancer cell lines on the of expression of
139 proteins and correlated this with cancer cell growth for the cell lines tested, 9 expression
values for each protein correlated with 9 growth proliferation values (Figure 7E and
Supplementary Table S4). Decreased phosphorylation of AKT following SIK2 depletion
resulted in the highest direct correlation with suppression of ovarian cancer cell growth
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.83, p=0.006, Figure 7F). In contrast, depletion of SIK2
resulted in increased LKB1 expression and this significantly correlated with suppression of
ovarian cancer cell growth, i.e. a strong negative correlation (Pearson’s correlation
coefficient = − 0.82, p=0.007).

Loss of SIK2 sensitizes ovarian cancer to paclitaxel in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on the above findings we proposed that depletion of SIK2 interferes with G1/S
progression leading to apparent early resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis due to
decreased paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest (Figure 7C and Supplementary Figure S7). We
hypothesized that cells escaping from G1/S following SIK2 depletion fail to undergo
centrosome separation and that this leads to sensitization to paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity.
To test this hypothesis we utilized two orthotopic models of ovarian cancer metastasis
(SKOv3ip and HeyA8 cancer cells) and in vivo SIK2 KD using neutral nanoliposomal
(DOPC) delivery of siRNA (Figure 8A–B). As expected, depletion of SIK2 resulted in a
significant decrease in the mitotic index 24 hours following paclitaxel treatment (p<0.001, ttest, Figure 8C–D). However, SIK2 KD resulted in a significant increase in monopolar
mitotic cells (p<0.001, Figure 8E–F) and a significant decrease in tumor weight following
paclitaxel treatment compared to non-targeting control siRNA-DOPC treated with paclitaxel
(p=0.008 and 0.005 for SKOv3ip and HeyA8 models, respectively; t test, Figure 8G–H).
Depletion of SIK2, independent from paclitaxel, resulted in a modest decrease in tumor
weight in the SKOv3ip model (p=0.2) and a modest but significant decrease of tumor
weights in the HeyA8 model (p=0.02). Taken together, these results confirm the effect of
loss of SIK2 in inducing synergy to paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have previously shown that LKB1, a master kinase for all members of the AMPK
superfamily, plays an important role in regulating mitosis through mechanisms that
remained unclear (Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004). In this work we have identified a
previously unrecognized role for SIK2, a member of the AMPK family in regulating
centrosome separation during mitosis. The effect of depletion of SIK2 on mitosis and
centrosome function is unlikely to be secondary to depletion of energy reserves. Previous
work has shown that the key role that SIK2 plays in metabolism is in regulating energy
balance in refeeding from starvation (Dentin et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2008). During fasting ATP depletion leads to PKA activation which inhibits SIK2 resulting
in dephosphorylation of its cytoplasmic target TORC2 and its accumulation in the nucleus.
Nuclear TORC2 enhances CREB-mediated gluconeogenesis in an effort to increase ATP
production to maintain its intracellular level. Upon re-feeding from starvation, rising ATP
levels lead to inactivation of PKA and this results in SIK2 activation leading to
phosphorylation of TORC2 and its cytoplasmic retention and degradation. This results in
inhibition of gluconeogenesis and decreased ATP production through this pathway. Thus,
based on this evidence depletion of SIK2 would not be expected to lead to loss of
intracellular ATP under normal feeding conditions. Indeed, work in Drosophila has shown
that depletion of the orthologue of SIK2 results in enhanced resistance to metabolic stress in
neurons (Wang et al., 2008). We have also shown here that depletion of SIK2 did not result
in decreased ATP levels in SKOv3 cells. Therefore, loss of ATP cannot explain the mitotic
phenotypes that we have observed following SIK2 depletion.
We propose that displacement of PRKAR2A from the centrosome in prophase relieves SIK2
from inhibition. This molecular event coupled with higher centrosome expression of SIK2 at
the onset of mitosis may initiate centrosome separation by inducing additional
phosphorylation of centrosome linker proteins such as C-Nap1. We speculate that NEK2
may induce sub-threshold phosphorylation of C-Nap1 and that optimal phosphorylation is
achieved at the onset of mitosis by the activity of SIK2. These molecular events could
complement the known decrease in phosphatases, such as PP1α, that oppose NEK2 activity
prior to the onset of mitosis (Meraldi and Nigg, 2001). Our findings add further proof to the

emerging evidence of coupling cancer cell metabolism and mitosis functions of the AMPK
family members.

It is important to note that SIK2 is a rare example of a therapeutic target that upon depletion
results in mitosis-dependent synergy with paclitaxel as well as G1/S arrest and decreased
cancer growth independent from taxanes. It is becoming clearer that regimens involving
combination therapies targeting different phases of the cell cycle are desirable for optimal
cancer response. Several microtubule-independent mitotic inhibitors have been tested in
early clinical trials with or without taxanes. The results from these trials are still emerging
but such approaches have so far resulted in disease stabilization or partial responses
(Blagden et al., 2008; Gautschi et al., 2008; Perez de Castro et al., 2008; Strebhardt and
Ullrich, 2006). Targeting SIK2 may offer inhibition of cancer cell growth by targeting
multiple phases of the cell cycle. Using reverse phase protein arrays we showed that SIK2 is
required for phosphorylation of AKT at S473 and this may contribute to the delayed cell
cycle progression. Another possible contributing factor is the centrosome abnormalities
following SIK2 depletion in interphase. It is well documented that the centrosome functions
as a docking site for several proteins involved in cell cycle progression (Matsumoto and
Maller, 2004). Centrosome dysfunction following loss of key centrosome proteins or
centrosome displacement results in severe G1 arrest (Hinchcliffe et al., 2001; Keryer et al.,
2003; Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001; Matsumoto and Maller, 2004). We have shown that loss
of SIK2 results in profound abnormalities in centrosome position, and function that may be
the underlying cause for the observed G1 arrest.
An important consideration for examining the potential therapeutic role of SIK2 will be to
test the toxicity profile following its inhibition. This could be achieved in mouse models of
ovarian cancer metastasis using SIK2 inhibitors. To our knowledge, no specific inhibitors
for SIK2 are currently available. Future work focusing on resolving the structure of SIK2 to
inform the development of inhibitors in parallel with running small-molecule inhibitor
compound screens will be important to identify prototype inhibitors of SIK2. The work
shown here provides extensive phenotypic and biochemical data to support the development
of SIK2 inhibitors. Such inhibitors will be highly valuable for further testing of the
biological and therapeutic potential of SIK2 and for examining its toxicity profile in vivo. It
is important to consider that in mammals SIK2 plays a role in regulating energy balance in
subcutaneous fat upon re-feeding from starvation. However, its role in maintaining energy
reserves under normal feeding conditions remains unclear. Therefore, whether its inhibition
under normal feeding conditions will result in energy imbalance and consequent toxicities
remains to be tested in animal models.

In this work we showed that the expression level of SIK2 correlated with prognosis in
patients with ovarian high grade serous cancers and with paclitaxel response. In addition we
showed that the expression level of SIK2 did not correlate with carboplatin response in the
context of a prospective randomized study. Furthermore, our data in vitro and in xenograft
models show a clear relationship between the intracellular levels of SIK2 and response to
paclitaxel. However, this work does not exclude the possibility of an effect of SIK2 on
response to non anti-tubulin agents. It will be interesting to investigate the effect of SIK2 on
response to other chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in clinical samples in future studies.
Regulation of SIK2 might also potentiate targeted therapies. Knockdown of SIK2 was shown
to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of AKT which might be put to use in overcoming
paradoxical activation of AKT by partial mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin (O'Reilly et
al., 2006).

In summary, this work identifies a previously unrecognized role of SIK2 in regulating cell
cycle progression and suggests SIK2 as an attractive target for treatment in a proportion of
ovarian cancers that overexpress this protein.

Experimental procedures
Automated image acquisition, segmentation and analysis (high content analysis)
Automated image acquisition and analysis were performed using the In Cell Analyzer 1000
and the In Cell investigator software, respectively (GE Healthcare).
The Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS)
This was a population-based, multicentre translational study that comprised prospective
collection of bio-specimens, clinical and epidemiological data from patients with primary
epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer diagnosed between 2001 and
2005. All patients were prospectively consented using a protocol approved by human
research ethics committees at multiple participating clinical and research centres. Further
details of the AOCS cohort can be found at http://www.aocstudy.org and in the
supplementary experimental procedures.
In vivo experiments in mice

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mice were cared for in accordance
with guidelines set forth by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care and the US Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Female nude mice were inoculated with ovarian cancer cell lines
(HeyA8 or SKOV3ip1) into the peritoneal cavity. After 1 week, SiRNA was incorporated in
DOPC-nanoliposomes and administered intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose of 150 µg/kg per
mouse, biweekly. Paclitaxel was administered IP once a week at a dose of 100 µg per mouse
for HeyA8 and 75 µg per mouse for SKOV3ip1. Mice were treated for 3–4 weeks and all
treatment groups were sacrificed and necropsied when any single group became moribund
and assayed for tumor weight.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taxanes stabilize microtubules, inhibit mitosis, induce apoptosis and produce regression
in a fraction of cancers that arise at many sites including the ovary. The anti-tumor
activity of taxanes might be increased by concurrently regulating kinases that affect both
cell cycle and mitosis. Here we show that SIK2 localizes at the centrosome,
phosphorylates the centrosome linker protein C-Nap1 and plays a key role in regulating
the the onset of mitosis. SIK2 depletion resulted in profound synergy with paclitaxel in
inducing cytotoxicity, while higher expression in ovarian cancers correlated with poor
prognosis. Independent of its antimitotic role, SIK2 targeting resulted in decreased G1/S
transition and low AKT phosphorylation. Thus, SIK2 provides a multimodal therapeutic
target in a subset of ovarian cancers.

A) A schematic presentation of the siRNA kinome screen. B–H) Each of the 779 genes
included in the screen was targeted using pools of 4 individual siRNAs. These pools were
divided into three plates (320 pools for plates 1 and 2 and 139 pools in plate 3). Three
replicates were used for each plate and ten images were obtained per well. Integrated nuclear
intensity (INI) values for individual cells, defined as the nuclear area multiplied by its mean
pixel intensity, were extracted from 32,400 images including a total of 1,946,532 cells. The
calculation of the percentage shift of the median integrated nuclear intensity value (ploidy
index) is explained in B–E. Images were obtained 48 hours following transfection with nontargeting siRNAs (B) or a pool of siRNAs targeting AURKB (C). Arrow heads in C point to

SKOv3 cells (5000 cells per well) were reverse transfected in 96 well plates using either
non-targeting controls or SIK2 siRNAs A, B and C for 24 hr and cells were then either a)
fixed and stained using crystal violet to estimate the number of cells on the day of paclitaxel
treatment (Day 0) or b) treated with either diluent or paclitaxel at 9 different concentrations.
The latter group of cells was fixed and stained 72 hr following drug treatment. Growth of
cells from day 0 to day 3 was estimated and the percentage paclitaxel-induced growth
inhibition for each siRNA in relation to diluent treated cells transfected with the same
siRNA was calculated and a least-squares fit was obtained to estimate the GI 50 as described
in methods (Monks et al., 1991). Shown is the mean ± s.e.m from three replicates per
concentration. In F the effect of depletion of SIK2 using siRNA C on paclitaxel response in
three cell lines is shown. The experiment was conducted as in E. Shown is the mean ± s.e.m
from six replicates per concentration. Also shown is the p value for the comparison between
the GI 50 in cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA control v cells transfected with SIK2
siRNA. G) Microarray expression data for two probe sets representing SIK2 were used to
generate Kaplan Meier survival curves for high expressing (defined as cancers with values

with undetectable C-Nap1 in the centrosomes. Mitotic cells were manually excluded from
the analysis. I) Cells were transfected with SIK2 expressing construct for 24 hr then fixed
and stained using the indicated antibodies. Note the lower C-Nap1 intensity in the
centrosomes of SIK2-transfected cell (1) compared to untransfected cell (2) in the same
field. Scale bar, 5 µm. Arrows point to magnified centrosome in the inset. J) Shown is the
percentage of cells with undetectable C-Nap1 centrosome signal per cell cycle stage
following transfection using the indicated plasmids. See also Figure S4.

Figure 5. SIK2 is required for centrosome separation in mitosis

A–E)Cancer cells were transfected with siRNAs for 48 hr as indicated then fixed and
stained. In A and B SKOv3 cells were stained using anti-γ-tubulin (red) and antiphosphohistone H3 (green) to reveal the centosome position in mitosis in relation to
chromosomes. Note the presence of examples from different mitosis phases in control cells
(1–4; prophase, prometaphase, metaphase and anaphase, respectively) compared to the
predominance of prometaphase cells following SIK2 KD. Also shown are examples of
multipolar (I) and monopolar (II) centrosome positioning following SIK2 KD. Bar plots in B
and D represent the mean ± s.d. of the percentages of cells at different stages of mitosis. Bar
plots in C represent the mean prometaphase/metaphase ratio ± standard deviation. F–G)

Figure 6. The centrosome localization of PRKAR2A is required for regulating the appropriate
timing of centrosome separation by SIK2

A-SKOv3 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 72 hours then fixed and
stained. The centrosome expression of PRKAR2A is present in control cells (arrow) but
absent following KD of AKAP450 (I and II). B) Bar plots represent the mean ± s.d. of
triplicate percentages of cells with CS following transfection with the indicated siRNAs.
Depletion of AKAP450 resulted in a significant increase in CS while co-depletion of
AKAP450 and SIK2 rescued this phenotype. Scale bar, 5 µm. See also Figure S6.

Figure 7. SIK2 is required for AKT phosphorylation and growth of ovarian cancer cells

A) SKOv3, ES2 and Hey cells were either transfected using non-targeting control siRNA or
the indicated SIK2 siRNAs for 5 days. Cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet.
Shown is the mean ± s.e.m. of 12 replicate values per siRNA transfection type from two
independent experiments in SKOv3 cells. ** indicates p<0.001. Error bars for Hey and ES2
cells represent the s.e.m. of 6 replicate values per siRNA transfection type from two
independent experiments. B) Typical cell cycle distributions are presented following
transfection of SKOv3 cells with the indicated siRNAs. C) Cells were transfected using the
indicated siRNA for 48 hr then treated with paclitaxel 100 nM for 24 hr, fixed and stained
using anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody to calculate the mitotic index (MI) using flow

cytometry. Shown is the mean MI (± s.d.) of two independent experiments. D) Cell lines
were transfected with the indicated SIK2 siRNAs and control non-targeting siRNAs for 48
hr then harvested for analysis of protein expression using reverse phase protein arrays.
Shown is the fraction of expression of AKT-pS437 and total AKT following SIK2 siRNA
transfection relative to protein expression following non-targeting siRNAs. E) The
expression of 139 proteins (Supplementary Table S4) was estimated using reverse phase
protein arrays as in D following transfection of cancer cells using three SIK2 siRNAs and
one non-targeting control in 3 cell lines; SKOv3, Hey and ES2. The expression of each of
the 139 proteins was correlated with cancer cell growth that was measured in A. Each bar
represents the coefficient of the correlation between the expression of each of the proteins in
9 cell lines (3 SIK2 siRNAs × 3 cell lines) and the growth of the cancer cell line from which
the protein was measured. Positive values indicate that higher expression of a protein
correlates with more cancer cell growth. Negative values indicate that higher expression
correlate with poor growth. F) Shown is the regression lines for the correlation between the
fraction of ovarian cancer cell proliferation following SIK2 depletion relative to nontargeting control and the fraction expression of AKT-pS437 or total AKT following SIK2
depletion relative to non-targeting controls. See also Figure S7 and Table S4.
