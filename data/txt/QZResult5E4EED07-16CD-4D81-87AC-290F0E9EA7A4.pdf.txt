ABSTRACT:
Spores of some species of the strictly anaerobic bacteria Clostridium naturally
target and partially lyse the hypoxic cores of tumors, which tend to be refractory
to conventional therapies. The anti-tumor effect can be augmented by engineering
strains to convert a non-toxic prodrug into a cytotoxic drug specifically at the tumor
site by expressing a prodrug-converting enzyme (PCE). Safe doses of the favored
prodrug CB1954 lead to peak concentrations of 6.3 µM in patient sera, but at these
concentration(s) known nitroreductase (NTR) PCEs for this prodrug show low
activity. Furthermore, efficacious and safe Clostridium strains that stably express a
PCE have not been reported. Here we identify a novel nitroreductase from Neisseria
meningitidis, NmeNTR, which is able to activate CB1954 at clinically-achievable
serum concentrations. An NmeNTR expression cassette, which does not contain an
antibiotic resistance marker, was stably localized to the chromosome of Clostridium
sporogenes using a new integration method, and the strain was disabled for safety
and containment by making it a uracil auxotroph. The efficacy of Clostridium-Directed
Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (CDEPT) using this system was demonstrated in a mouse
xenograft model of human colon carcinoma. Substantial tumor suppression was
achieved, and several animals were cured. These encouraging data suggest that the
novel enzyme and strain engineering approach represent a promising platform for
the clinical development of CDEPT.

INTRODUCTION

and tumor infiltration been described [3]. Several types of
bacteria have also been investigated as delivery vectors,
and as therapeutics in their own right [4, 5]. Spores of
some species of Clostridium, which are strictly anaerobic
bacteria, naturally target tumors with high specificity
following intravenous administration, because the dormant
spores can germinate and grow only in the hypoxic/
necrotic cores of solid tumors [6–8] which are difficult

Biotechnology potentially offers unconventional
routes to new cancer therapies, and research in this
area has focused on using viruses as vectors to deliver
therapeutic genes to tumors. Unfortunately, issues with the
safety of viral vectors have been encountered [1, 2] and
only recently has a virus system showing good specificity

to target using viral vectors [9, 10]. The growing bacteria
secrete proteases inside the tumor, rapidly digesting
the tumor mass. This approach is especially interesting
because it directly targets the hypoxic cells in poorly
vascular regions which are refractory to conventional
treatments. Any Clostridium cells entering normal tissue
from a colonized tumor would be poisoned by oxygen and
die.
Stringent spacial containment by oxygen is an
excellent safety feature, absent from treatments using
bacteria that are not strict anaerobes [11, 12], but it also
allows neoplastic cells at the oxygenated tumor periphery
to escape proteolysis [13]. Therefore, we and others have
sought to augment the anti-tumor effect of Clostridium
strains by genetically modifying them to express
therapeutic proteins, mainly enzymes which sensitize the
tumor to specific chemotherapeutic agents [14–20]. The
prodrug CB1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide)
shown in Figure 1 is an attractive candidate because its
clinical safety has been demonstrated [21], and because
a 10,000-fold increase in toxicity is achieved upon its
activation by a suitable nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme to
the 4-hydroxylamine (4HX) derivative 5-(aziridin-1-yl)4-hydroxylamino-2-nitrobenzamide. The 4HX derivative
forms a potent DNA cross-linking agent [22, 23] which,
importantly, has been shown to kill both proliferating and
non-proliferating cells [24], both of which are present in
hypoxic tumor areas.
Encouraging preclinical efficacy data have been
achieved with genetically engineered NTR-expressing
Clostridium [19, 20]. However, for this ClostridiumDirected Enzyme-Prodrug Therapy (CDEPT) using
CB1954 to be suitable for clinical evaluation, two issues
must be addressed. Firstly, the poor kinetics of CB1954
activation by known NTRs must be improved upon.
The maximum concentration of CB1954 which can be
safely achieved in patient serum is only 6.3 µM [21], at
which concentration previously-reported enzymes are not
saturated. Secondly, a recombinant Clostridium strain must
be constructed with properties appropriate for clinical
application. The DNA encoding the prodrug-converting
enzyme should be stably localized to the chromosome
rather than carried by a plasmid, antibiotic-resistance
gene(s) used during strain construction must be removed,
and preferably the organism should be disabled to prevent
its growth in the event of a release into the environment. A
strain meeting these criteria has not been described in any
report to-date. Here we solve each of these problems and
demonstrate the efficacy of CDEPT in a mouse xenograft
model of human colon carcinoma, using CB1954 and a
recombinant Clostridium strain potentially suitable for
clinical trial.

A novel NTR which efficiently activates CB1954 at
clinically-achievable concentrations
Known enzymes with NTR activity against CB1954
are NAD(P)H-dependent quinone reductases belonging
to one of two large protein families, Pfam PF00881
‘Nitroreductase’ and Pfam PF02525 ‘Flavodoxin_2’,
such as E. coli NfnB [25] and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
YwrO [26] respectively. We identified homologs of
these proteins in the genome sequences of organisms or
genomic DNA available in our laboratory (see Supporting
Information), and investigated the activity of several of
these against CB1954. Each gene encoding a candidate
CB1954-activating enzyme was cloned in an E. coli
expression vector. Crude cell lysates were used in initial
screens for functional expression, and then to test for
CB1954 nitroreductase activity using an HPLC assay (see
Supporting Information). CB1954 was rapidly consumed
by cell lysates containing the NfnB homolog from
Haemophilus somnus 129PT or Neisseria meningitidis
MC58. Therefore these two enzymes, which we designate
HsoNTR and NmeNTR respectively, were studied in more
detail.
NmeNTR and HsoNTR were each affinity-tagged,
over-expressed, purified, and the CB1954 nitroreductase
activities of the purified proteins characterized using
the HPLC assay. The reaction products and kinetic
parameters of these enzymes with respect to CB1954
and NADH were determined (Table 1). Both NmeNTR
and HsoNTR reduce CB1954 only at the 4-nitro group,

Figure 1: The prodrug CB1954 is a low-toxicity
monofunctional DNA-alkylating agent, but can be
converted to a much more toxic bifunctional DNAalkylating agent upon 2 x 2-electron reduction of
the 4-nitro or 2-nitro group to the corresponding
hydroxylamine. The 4-hydroxylamine is more cytotoxic than

the 2-hydroxylamine. Some NAD(P)H-dependent nitroreductase
(NTR) enzymes can catalyse this reaction, with varying kinetics
and nitro group specificity (see Table 1).

Construction of NTR-expressing Clostridium
strains that are stable, disabled, and lack
antibiotic marker genes

producing the highly toxic 4HX derivative. This contrasts
with the widely-studied E. coli NfnB which reduces
CB1954 at either the 4-nitro group or 2-nitro group,
producing equimolar quantities of the 4HX derivative
and much less toxic 2-hydroxylamine (2HX) derivative
(5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2-hydroxylamino-4-nitrobenzamide)
[27, 28]. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of HsoNTR
and NmeNTR differ dramatically from those of E. coli
NfnB and other published enzymes (Table 1). Crucially,
NmeNTR is the first reported enzyme with a KmCB1954 lower
than 6.3 µM, the maximum concentration of CB1954
which can be safely achieved in patient serum. NmeNTR
would therefore approach saturation with CB1954 in
a therapeutic regime using the maximum clinicallyrecommended dose, so the prodrug would be efficiently
activated and high levels of tumor-specific cytotoxicity
achieved.

To establish whether the apparently superior
kinetic properties of NmeNTR would result in improved
therapeutic performance, we sought to construct and
compare strains of Clostridium sporogenes NCIMB 10696
expressing either NmeNTR or the most-studied CB1954activating enzyme E. coli NfnB in an in vivo model. C.
sporogenes NCIMB 10696 is one of the tumor-targeting
Clostridium strains currently most studied as a potential
therapeutic agent [16–20] along with Clostridium novyi
NT [29–32].
In previous CDEPT studies nitroreductases
have been expressed using autonomous plasmids, but
these exhibit segregational instability [33], causing the

of tumor-targeting Clostridium sp. has not previously
been reported, but is now possible using methods for
chromosomal integration in C. sporogenes that we have
recently developed [35–37].
An expression cassette was constructed using a
strong, constitutive promoter derived from the ferredoxin
gene fdx of C. sporogenes to direct expression of
NmeNTR from a synthetic coding sequence sequence with
codon usage optimized to suit C. sporogenes. A similar
expression cassette for E. coli NfnB was also constructed.
The NmeNTR expression cassette was initially inserted
into the C. sporogenes chromosome using the ClosTron
method [35, 36] which employs a modified bacterial
Group II intron (a type of mobile retro-element [38]) to
deliver the sequence of interest. Recombinant clones were
isolated using the antibiotic erythromycin, resistance to
which is conferred by the marker gene ermB within
the insertion. As antibiotic resistance is undesirable in
therapeutic strains, subsequent removal of ermB from the
chromosome using FLP recombinase was attempted, but
was unsuccessful (see Supporting Information).
To circumvent the need for marker removal, we used
our recently-developed integration method ACE, in which
an antibiotic selection marker need not be incorporated
into the chromosome along with the expression cassette
[37]. NmeNTR and E. coli NfnB expression cassettes
were inserted into the C. sporogenes chromosome using
integration vector pMTL-JH27, which targets pyrE, a
gene involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis. By inactivating
pyrE during integration, recombinant cells are also uracil
auxotrophs and effectively disabled from growth in the
environment. The concept of disabling a strain to ensure
containment was proposed at the advent of recombinant
DNA technology [39] and has recently been applied to
restrict Salmonella amino acid auxotrophs to tumors [11,
12]. Using this approach, the desired recombinant C.
sporogenes strains containing E. coli NfnB and NmeNTR
were readily obtained, and were designated E1 and N1,
respectively (Figure 2A and B). The ‘empty’ vector pMTLJH27 was previously used to generate a pyrE mutant
without an expression cassette [37] which we used as a
control in this study (Figure 2A).

to decrease during growth. Therefore expression of a
plasmid-borne NTR is likely to be poor and heterogenous
in a tumor colonized through many generations of bacterial
growth [34] following the initial infiltration of a small
number of plasmid-containing spores. Plasmids also carry
a risk of transfer to other organisms. To overcome these
issues, we opted to use expression constructs localized
to the chromosome, which has complete segregational
stability and no mechanism for transfer. The insertion of
heterologous expression constructs into the chromosome

are the mean of three independent experiments, error bars show

Strain characterization in vitro
To determine whether the heterologous
nitroreductases were functionally expressed by strains E1
and N1, we measured the menadione reductase activity
in cell lysates of these strains and compared them to the
wild type and the pyrE mutant. Cells lysates of both E1
and N1 contained menadione reductase activity elevated
significantly above the endogenous levels measured in the
controls (Figure 2C).
The disablement of E1, N1 and the pyrE mutant
was confirmed by sub-culturing cells of these strains
and the wild type from the complex medium TYG onto

plates of a defined growth medium either with or without
supplementary uracil. The wild type grew equally well
with or without the uracil supplement, whereas E1, N1 and
the pyrE mutant were unable to grow without exogenous
uracil, confirming their disablement, a uracil auxotrophic
phenotype.
CDEPT depends upon the ability of Clostridium to
form spores, the metabolically-dormant, highly-robust
form suitable for intravenous administration and for long
periods of storage. Therefore it was necessary to determine
whether the ability of the recombinant strains to form
spores had been affected by the inactivation of pyrE, the
addition of the NTR expression cassettes, or the subculturing steps during the genetic modification procedure.
The wild type, E1, N1 and the pyrE mutant were cultivated
in TYG broth, in which the wild type forms spores over
time. A spo0A mutant, which is completely unable to form
spores, was also included as a control [35]. Samples taken
over several days were heated to inactivate vegetative
cells, and the titre of heat-resistant colony-forming units
(corresponding to viable spores) was determined by
dilution plating (Figure 2D). The spo0A mutant formed
no colonies following heat treatment, confirming that the
procedure inactivated all vegetative cells. E1, N1 and the
pyrE mutant were all able to form spores, and did so at
the same rate as the wild type, and to the same final titer.

without inclusion of any antibiotic resistance gene,
we next determined whether administration of these
clinically-applicable strains in combination with prodrug
administration to tumor-bearing animals would result in
anti-tumor efficacy. To do so, we compared the effect
in animals that received (1) no treatment, (2) CB1954
prodrug alone, (3) sham treatment (spores and vehicle),
(4) pyrE mutant control spores in combination with
CB1954 and (5) N1 or E1 spores in combination with
CB1954, each in a standard experimental tumor growth
delay setting. This choice of groups allowed us to compare
the contribution of the two major improvements reported
here, stable integration and improved enzyme kinetics.
Spores were collected, quantified and intravenously
administered at a concentration of 5x107 cfu per animal
when tumors reached a volume of ~250 mm3, followed
five days later by sham or prodrug administration.
Colonization evaluation in randomly chosen tumors from
each group (n≥14 per group) showed equal numbers of the
C. sporogenes cells per g tumor tissues for all strains, with
>99% of cfu being in the metabolically active vegetative
form. Colonization was also confirmed by gram staining.
In tumors, C. sporogenes vegetative cells are visible as
purple, gram-positive rods (Figure 3C). Disablement of
the strain by knocking out pyrE thus did not affect the
excellent tumor-colonizing capacity of C. sporogenes. In
line with our previous observations [19] administration
of prodrug alone did not result in any effect, and only a
small (non-significant) growth delay was observed upon
administration of spores alone (sham) or control spores
in combination with CB1954 (Figure 3 A). Strikingly,

resulted in a significant growth delay, the effect being most
pronounced for N1 (p<0.001, Figure 3 B). This suggests
that the superior kinetic properties of NmeNTR, which
allow conversion of the prodrug to its toxic derivative at
a much lower concentration than E. coli NfnB, contribute
substantially to the observed effect. The most striking
effect we observed was the disappearance of several
tumors in both CDEPT groups. In the E1/CB1954 group,
two out of 16 tumors completely disappeared and in the
N1/CB1954 four out of 16 tumors completely disappeared
(Figure S1). During the treatment, a mild and transient
weight loss could be observed and the animals recovered
completely during further follow-up time.

strains in the environment in the event of accidental
release from a clinical setting. Tumor containment and/
or targeting features have been described for other
recombinant bacterial strains with anti-tumor potential,
such as Salmonella [11, 12]. The use of elegant synthetic
regulatory mechanisms has also been proposed for
containment [4] but we are cautious of their use for this
purpose, and suggest that physiological mechanisms may
be more appropriate. Any system in which containment
depends upon the continued function of introduced
component(s) will be vulnerable to failure through
spontaneous loss-of-function mutations. Such mutations
are inevitable at some frequency, and mutants would have
a selective advantage for growth outside the tumor, so
these systems would be inherently fragile. In contrast, no
loss-of-function mutation is likely to allow an auxotrophic
mutant of a strict anaerobe, as reported here, to escape the
tumor environment.
Our approach to constructing stable, disabled,
antibiotic marker-free strains of Clostridium expressing
heterologous genes represents a platform for future efforts
to build upon, as it provides a tumor-specific delivery
system for the development of safe and effective gene
therapies. The novel PCE NmeNTR in combination with
CB1954 is a promising candidate. Besides cytotoxicity,
strains could be engineered to have additional clinicallyuseful properties. For example, we are currently working
to enable imaging of tumors undergoing Clostridium
therapy via clinically-relevant imaging modalities such as
PET. With the key strain engineering challenges overcome,
a clinical trial to realize this therapy is now in prospect.

DISCUSSION
The poor activity of known nitroreductases at
clinically-relevant CB1954 concentrations has led to
several previous attempts to obtain an enzyme with more
suitable kinetic properties, by screening native enzymes
[26, 40–43] and/or protein engineering [43–47] with some
success. However, NmeNTR, the N. meningitidis homolog
of E. coli nitroreductase NfnB reported here, is the first
example of an enzyme with a KmCB1954 value that can be
exceeded by the clinically-achievable serum concentration
of the prodrug. This KmCB1954 value (2.47 µM) is also sevenfold lower than the lowest previously reported (NfsA, 18
µM, Table 1). This key improvement makes NmeNTR
much more suitable for clinical application than other
known enzymes.
NmeNTR reduces only the 4-nitro group of
CB1954, producing the highly-cytotoxic 4HX derivative,
unlike E. coli NfnB which produces both the 4HX and
2HX derivatives in similar proportions [27, 28]. Among
the enzymes whose CB1954 nitroreductase activity has
now been characterized, specificity for the 4-nitro group
appears to be typical (Table 1). E. coli NfnB, although the
most widely studied CB1954 nitroreductase, is unusual in
this respect. The 4HX derivative is far more cytotoxic than
the 2HX derivative [22] which suggests that an enzyme
such as NmeNTR with specificity for the 4-nitro group
would lead to greater tumor-specific cytotoxicity.
By localizing expression cassettes to the
chromosome using double crossover homologous
recombination, we have constructed stable strains that
lack both antibiotic resistance markers and any mechanism
for transfer of the heterologous sequence. This feature
represents a major improvement over previous studies
in terms of efficacy and safety, as the instability of
known plasmid replicons in C. sporogenes has been
established [33] and transfer of natural and recombinant
conjugal plasmids and transposons is known to occur in
C. sporogenes and close relatives.
C. sporogenes is naturally confined to the hypoxic
tumor core by oxygen, and the disabling pyrE mutation we
introduce would serve to severely limit growth of modified

METHODS
Full methods are given in SI Appendix, Methods.

Enzyme characterization
Genes encoding homologs of nfnB and ywrO were
PCR-amplified from genomic DNA or cell lysates. E.
coli expression plasmids for each gene were constructed
by standard methods. Menadione reductase activities
of lysates of E. coli cells containing the expression
plasmids were determined using a spectrophotometric
assay, and CB1954 nitroreductase activities of lysates
were determined using an HPLC assay. Specific activities
were calculated using protein concentrations of lysates
determined using the Bradford assay. The 4HX and 2HX
derivatives of CB1954 were identified with reference
to standards, their known absorbance spectra, and their
anticipated column retention times. For determination of
kinetic parameters using the same CB1954 nitroreductase
assay, NTR expression plasmids were modified to encode
C-terminal 6xHis tags, and enzymes were purified using a
Novagen His-Bind kit.

Human colorectal HCT116 carcinoma cells were
injected subcutaneously into adult NMRI nu/nu mice.
Tumor volumes were determined three times per week
using calipers. 5x107 spores were administered when
tumors reached a volume of ~250 mm3, and sham or
prodrug treatment was started five days later. CB1954
was administered intraperitoneally at a concentration of
15 mg/kg for five consecutive days. At the end of the
follow-up period, colonization levels were determined in
tumors and normal tissues as described previously [48].
Tumor growth delay was determined as the time from the
start of the treatment necessary for a tumor to triple in
volume. Statistical significance was tested using a nonparametric Mann Whitney test. All animal testing was
performed in accordance with local institutional guidelines
and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee.
