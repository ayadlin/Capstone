Abstract
Cancer cells recruit normal cells such as fibroblasts to establish reactive
microenvironments. Via metabolic stress, catabolism and inflammation, these
cancer-associated fibroblasts set up a synergistic relationship with tumour cells, that
contributes to their malignancy and resistance to therapy. Given that chemotherapy is
a systemic treatment, the possibility that healthy cell damage affects the metastatic
risk or the prospect of developing a second malignancy becomes relevant. Here,
we demonstrate that standard chemotherapies phenotypically and metabolically
transform stromal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts, leading to the
emergence of a highly glycolytic, autophagic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment.
This catabolic microenvironment, in turn, activates stemness (Sonic hedgehog/GLI
signalling), antioxidant response and interferon-mediated signalling, in adjacent
breast cancer cells. Thus, we propose a model by which chemotherapy-induced
catabolism in healthy fibroblasts constitutes a source of energy-rich nutrients
and inflammatory cytokines that would activate stemness in adjacent epithelial
cells, possibly triggering new tumorigenic processes. In this context, immune cell
recruitment would be also stimulated to further support malignancy.

INTRODUCTION

CAFs enable metastasis and confer resistance to antitumour drugs [3, 7, 8].
The aim of conventional therapy is to specifically
kill the malignant cells within a tumour, although
it can also damage normal tissues and the tumour
microenvironment. Indeed, secretion of factors associated
with inflammation and cancer progression has been
detected in therapy-damaged senescent fibroblasts,
suggesting that current cancer treatments may contribute
to metastasis and de novo tumorigenesis [9]. One of the
most severe side-effects of cancer treatment is actually
the growth of a second primary tumour, an entirely new
malignancy different from metastatic growth. Second
primary cancers already account for one in six new
cancer diagnoses in the USA and are a significant cause
of mortality amongst patients who have been cured
of cancer, being the leading cause of death in Hodgkin
Lymphoma survivors [10]. Increased risk of developing a

Cancer cells are known to be the engine that drives
tumour development, although it is now evident that they
require help. Endothelial cells, immune cells, adipocytes
or fibroblasts are recruited to establish tumorigenic
microenvironments, which cooperate with cancer
cells to enable and support most of their hallmarks [1].
Stromal fibroblastic cells infiltrate and are induced to
differentiate into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
[2], which contribute to the energetics of tumour cells
by fuelling them with energy sources such as lactate,
ketones, glutamine, fatty acids or cysteine, reinforcing
not only their metabolic efficiency and growth but also
their survival [3-6] (Figure 1A-1B). Likewise, through
lactate-induced extracellular acidification and secretion of
inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes,

second malignancy has been reported after treatment with
either radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic agents, including
alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and antimetabolites, and it is dose-dependent [10]. Nevertheless,
high radiation doses concentrated on a limited field are less
tumorigenic than lower doses exposed to a wider area [11].
Hence, considering the systemic nature of chemotherapy,
the influence of therapy-damaged non-target cells on the
risk of developing a subsequent malignancy becomes
significant.
In this study, we test the hypothesis that
chemotherapy promotes the same responses in human
fibroblasts as their interaction with cancer cells, the socalled catabolic tumour stroma phenotype, which would
constitute an ideal environment for a new neoplastic lesion
to develop. We provide in vitro evidence of treatmentinduced modifications in fibroblastic cells including the
expression of αSMA, a glycolytic switch, an activation
of the JNK/AP1, HIF1, TGFβ/SMAD, STAT3 and NFkB
stress-induced pathways, senescence and autophagy,
and a greater secretion of the inflammatory cytokine
interleukin 6 (IL6). Finally we show the induction of
several stemness, antioxidant and immunogenic signalling
pathways in breast cancer cells when co-cultured with
stromal fibroblasts in response to chemotherapy.

We first hypothesised that chemotherapy would
increase lactate and ketone production, as we previously
showed their tumourigenic and metastatic effects in vivo
[12]. As a first screening, L-lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate
(β-HB) concentration was measured in hTERT-BJ1
fibroblasts after treatment with 12 different commonly
used drugs (Table 1) including azathioprine, carboplatin,
cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil,
gemcitabine,
methotrexate,
6-mercaptopurine,
mitoxantrone, 6-thioguanine and taxol, detecting an
increase in their production of L-lactate or β-HB compared
to vehicle (Table S1-S2). Six agents were selected to
proceed with the study according to their nature and their
potential on increasing L-lactate and β-HB production at
concentrations lower than 1 mM. Azathioprine (AZA), an
anti-metabolite and carboplatin (CP) and cisplatin (CIS),
both alkylating-like agents, were chosen and used for
further studies at a concentration of 100 µM. Likewise,
doxorubicin (DOX) and mitoxantrone (MTX), both
topoisomerase inhibitors and taxol (TAX), a cytoskeleton
drug, were selected at 100 nM. All chosen concentrations
were sub-lethal and caused a decrease in cell viability
lower than 50% after 72 h of treatment (Figure S1).

Chemotherapy transforms stromal fibroblasts in
highly glycolytic, less metabolically active cells

RESULTS

High lactate levels suggested a chemotherapyinduced glycolytic switch in stromal fibroblasts. Indeed,
L-lactate production and glucose consumption were
significantly higher in all treatment conditions compared
to vehicle (Figure 2A-2B), and ATP content was lower

To study the effects of chemotherapy on stromal cell
behaviour, human fibroblasts were treated with different
drugs and the induction of the catabolic tumour stroma
phenotype was assessed.

Figure 1: The catabolic tumour stroma phenotype. A. ROS production by rapidly proliferating cancer cells generates oxidative
stress to surrounding stromal cells, which induces changes in them such as CAF transformation, activation of HIF1, NFkB, TGFβ or
JNK/AP1 signalling pathways, a switch to aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy and senescence and release of
inflammatory cytokines: the catabolic tumour stroma phenotype. B. Due to increased glycolysis and autophagy, there is a higher production
of energy-rich metabolites such as lactate that are secreted by stromal cells and taken up by cancer cells, which use them to fuel their
mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production.

via enhanced MCT4 expression, hence increasing
extracellular acidification. According to the less efficient
ATP production during glycolysis than in complete

after azathioprine, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and taxol
treatments (Figure 2C). The extracellular acidification
rate (ECAR) was subsequently measured using an XF96
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Figures 3A-3C and S2A)
and glycolysis, glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve
were calculated after addition of glucose, oligomycin and
2-DG into the media. All drugs significantly increased
glycolytic capacity and most of them augmented the basal
glycolytic rate and glycolytic reserve (Figure 3D). Oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) and ECAR were also measured
in media containing glucose to plot the OCR versus ECAR
graph, which indicates the metabolic state of the cell
(Figure S2B). All agents notably induced a switch from a
more aerobic and metabolically active phenotype towards
a more glycolytic, less metabolically active phenotype
(Figure 3E-3G).
Increased ECAR indicated that the lactate produced
by fibroblasts upon treatment was being secreted. Indeed,
the expression of MCT4, the transporter that mediates
monocarboxylate efflux, was perceptibly up-regulated in
chemotherapy-treated hTERT-BJ1 compared to vehicle,
as observed by immunofluorescence (Figure 4). Thus,
chemotherapy stimulates fibroblasts to consume more
glucose and produce more lactate, which is released

bodies are generated. Thus, we decided to assess whether
chemotherapy can also induce autophagy and ketogenesis
in these cells. Stromal fibroblasts were exposed to
chemotherapy and subsequently stained for autophagic
vacuole production, which was significantly enhanced
by all drugs (Figure 6A). We next measured the levels of
ketones in the media of chemotherapy-treated fibroblasts,
and in line with our first screening we found that all
drugs induced β-HB secretion (Figure 6B). To determine
senescence levels after chemotherapy treatment, hTERTBJ1 fibroblasts were assessed for senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, which appeared to
be significantly greater in all drug treatments except
mitoxantrone (Figure 6C). Alternatively, expression of
p53 and p21, known regulators of cellular senescence,
was also assessed by immunoblotting. Most drugs showed
p53 and p21 over-expression (Figure 6D). Collectively,
these results indicate higher autophagy and senescence in
hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts upon treatment.
One of the features of senescence is the tumourpromoting senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP), which occurs in response to treatment-induced
DNA damage in normal and tumour cells [19, 20] and
contains inflammatory cytokines, which can further
aggravate chemotherapy-related inflammation. We
therefore decided to determine whether chemotherapy
would induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by
screening the media of hTERT-BJ1 cells treated with
either doxorubicin or vehicle using a Cytokine Antibody
Array. IL6 was the most up-regulated cytokine in
doxorubicin -treated fibroblasts relative to vehicle (Figure
S3A). Indeed, amongst SASP-secreted cytokines there is
IL6, which is also present in the media of fibroblasts and
cancer cells in co-culture [21]. Doxorubicin, mitoxantrone
and taxol significantly increased the secretion of IL6 in
hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts, as confirmed by ELISA, whereas
azathioprine decreased it (Figure 6E).

Chemotherapy promotes oxidative stress and
stress-induced signalling pathways in stromal
fibroblasts
We next sought to determine the intracellular ROS
levels of chemotherapy-treated hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts,
as chemotherapy has been shown to cause oxidative
stress in cancer cells and healthy tissues [13, 14].
Carboplatin, doxorubicin and taxol treatments enhanced
ROS production, whereas cisplatin and mitoxantrone did
not modify ROS levels and azathioprine reduced them
(Figure 5A). To evaluate whether high oxidative stress was
due to an antioxidant response deficiency, we generated
hTERT-BJ1-ARE(luc) reporter cells, which were exposed
to chemotherapy and assessed for luciferase activity.
Taxol and doxorubicin induced a significant activation
of luciferase activity at late time points. Other drugs did
not increase or even significantly reduced ARE-dependent
response, including carboplatin, which produced the
highest ROS levels (Figure 5B). Thus, some drugs were
able to induce oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts
at the chosen concentrations, but either failed to elicit
antioxidant response or that response was slow, implying a
lack of a strong antioxidant response as one of the reasons
behind the increase in ROS production.
Oxidative stress in the stroma, which is generally
caused by cancer cells at the onset of their synergy,
promotes CAF transformation and HIF1, NFkB, JNK,
STAT3 and TGFβ activation in the stromal compartment
[6, 15, 16]. Thus, we next assessed the activation of these
signalling pathways. Five reporter hTERT-BJ1 cell lines
were generated (Table 2), exposed to chemotherapy, and
luciferase activity was determined. All drugs significantly
amplified NFkB and AP1 signalling (Figure 5D, 5G).
Likewise, HIF, SMAD and STAT3 signalling was
increased by most agents (Figure 5C, 5E-5F). Finally,
upstream of AP1, the phosphorylation levels of SAPK/
JNK and c-Jun were also up-regulated after all drug
treatments except azathioprine relative to vehicle-treated
fibroblasts, as measured by immunoblotting, whereas total
JNK and c-Jun protein levels did not show substantial
differences, indicating an activation of the whole JNK/
AP1 pathway in chemotherapy-treated hTERT-BJ1
fibroblasts. Carboplatin also intensified total c-Jun protein
expression levels (Figure 5H).

myofibroblastic

Myofibroblasts or CAFs are abundant components
of the tumour microenvironment and mostly accountable
for the development of fibrosis, a common side effect of
cancer therapy. CAFs are characterised by the expression
of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) [22]. Therefore, we
determined αSMA expression on lysates of chemotherapytreated hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts, observing an upregulation of αSMA by most drugs (Figure 6D). Thus,
chemotherapy can trigger transformation of fibroblasts
into myofibroblasts.

Chemotherapy triggers autophagy, senescence,
and IL6 secretion in stromal fibroblasts
Autophagy and senescence are known to be a
common response to DNA-damaging agents such as
chemotherapy [17, 18]. Autophagy is a process by
which lipid degradation is induced and therefore ketone

remarkably stimulated GLI signalling compared to
vehicle, in MCF7 cancer cells (Figure 8B). Likewise,
carboplatin and doxorubicin did not inhibit SMAD
signalling as observed in the vehicle and luciferase
activity of mitoxantrone and taxol co-culture treatments
was significantly augmented. Similarly, carboplatin did
not inhibit Wnt signalling, and mitoxantrone and taxol
were able to stimulate TCF/LEF signalling compared
to the vehicle (Figure 8D and 8F). Finally, carboplatin
and doxorubicin reinforced STAT3 signalling after 24 h,
whereas azathioprine inhibited it (Figure 8H).
In summary, chemotherapy inhibits most studied
signalling pathways in MCF7 cancer cells. In contact
with hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts, though, MCF7 cancer cells
establish a crosstalk with stromal cells as assessed by
activation or inhibition of these pathways. That interaction,
however, is altered upon treatment and stromal fibroblasts
are able to stimulate antioxidant and immune response,
and trigger various signalling pathways associated with
tumour proliferation, survival and stemness in MCF7
cancer cells, providing new insights from which treatment
failure and chemotherapy-induced tumorigenesis can be
further investigated.

Using our co-culture system in a range of reporter
cells, we pursued to identify the mechanism by which
stromal cells promote chemoresistance, prompt metastasis
or even de novo tumorigenesis. We hypothesised that
therapy-induced stromal IL6 secretion would stimulate
STAT3 in neighbouring cancer cells. Likewise, we
assessed the effects of stromal cells on antioxidant
(ARE), immune response (ISRE, GAS), or stem cell
signalling (GLI, TCF/LEF, SMAD) in cancer cells when
co-cultured with fibroblasts upon treatment. Therefore,
several reporter MCF7-GFP cell lines were generated
(Table 2), and cultured either as monolayers or cocultured with fibroblasts, treated with chemotherapy, and
assessed for luciferase activity. We first evaluated AREdependent signalling pathway. Azathioprine and cisplatin
significantly increased luciferase signal in MCF7GFP-ARE(luc) monocultures, whereas doxorubicin,
mitoxantrone and taxol significantly decreased it (Figure
7A). ARE signalling was inhibited when fibroblasts
were present in the culture. However, azathioprine,
mitoxantrone and taxol co-culture treatments did not
inhibit luciferase activity compared to vehicle, showing a
reactivation of ARE signalling (Figure 7B).
Immune response is thought to be supressed in the
body after anti-cancer treatment. Indeed, the drugs used in
this study are also used as immunosuppressants. Therefore,
we assessed interferon-mediated signalling, which was
significantly inhibited by most drugs in MCF7 (Figure
7C, 7E) and hTERT-BJ1 monocultures (Figure S3B-S3C).
Nevertheless, interaction with hTERT-BJ1 remarkably
enhanced ISRE activation in MCF7 cells. Cisplatin,
doxorubicin and taxol treatments further increased ISRE
signalling in the co-cultures compared to vehicle, and
azathioprine significantly decreased it (Figure 7D). The
presence of hTERT-BJ1 in the culture reduced GAS
signalling, yet carboplatin and doxorubicin did not inhibit
GAS signalling and luciferase signal in mitoxantrone and
taxol co-culture treatments was significantly higher than in
the vehicle (Figure 7F). Thus, cancer cells in contact with
stromal fibroblasts are able to elicit interferon-mediated
signalling in response to chemotherapy.
Finally, we determined the activation of stemnessrelated pathways in MCF7 cancer cells in synergy with
stromal fibroblasts after chemotherapeutic exposure.
Most drugs did not have an effect or inhibited all assessed
pathways in the cancer cell monolayers (Figure 8A, 8C,
8E and 8G). In interaction with hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts,
Sonic hedgehog (Shh)/GLI signalling was not modified,
TGFβ/SMAD and Wnt/TCF/LEF signalling pathways
were decreased, and STAT3 signalling was activated at 48
h. However, in co-cultures, all drugs except azathioprine

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy promotes the catabolic tumour
stroma phenotype
In this study we show for the first time the induction
of a clear metabolic stress in stromal fibroblasts that
favours glycolysis and lactate production to the detriment
of mitochondrial metabolism in response to chemotherapy,
phenotype previously defined as one of the hallmarks of
the catabolic tumour stroma. Previous results in breast
cancer imply that lactate secreted by stromal fibroblasts
can be utilised as a mitochondrial fuel by the surrounding
cancer cells [12, 23], and enables chemoresistance due
to extracellular acidification [24]. Moreover, lactate
administration increases the number of metastasis in vivo
and stimulates migration [12] and expression of stemnessrelated genes in breast cancer cells in vitro. These gene
signatures can in turn predict recurrence and metastasis in
breast cancer [25].
Our results demonstrate that chemotherapy can
stimulate HIF, NFkB, SMAD, STAT3 and JNK/AP1
stress-linked signalling pathways, and are consistent with
previous studies showing activation of these signalling
pathways due to oxidative stress by anticancer therapies
also in healthy cells [6, 13, 32]. Oxidative stress in
the stroma is generally caused by cancer cells at the
onset of their metabolic synergy [6, 26] and promotes
CAF transformation in the stromal compartment and
invasiveness in breast cancer cells [15]. HIF1, NFkB,
10738

Oncotarget

Cancer cells induce NFkB signalling in tumour-associated
macrophages (TAMs), triggering their IL6 secretion,
which in turn stimulates the neoplastic proliferation via
STAT3 activation [43]. Consistent with that, and with the
fact that chemotherapy is associated with up-regulation
of inflammation markers and stress response genes in
healthy tissues [44, 45], we observed that chemotherapydamaged fibroblasts trigger NFkB and other stressinduced pathways and promote the secretion of IL6,
energy-rich metabolites and possibly other ligands, which
have the potential to succour cancer cells in their battle for
survival, in their purpose to metastasise, or even through
which partially-transformed epithelial cells may be more
susceptible to become fully malignant, giving rise to a new
cancer.

JNK, STAT3 and TGFβ activation in the stroma occurs
with increased catabolism, which in turn can promote
cancer proliferation [14, 16, 27-30] and can cause
immunosuppression and angiogenesis, making cancer
more invasive [31].
Exposure to chemotherapy also induced the
transformation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts,
another feature of the catabolic tumour stroma. It has been
previously shown that the presence of fibrotic lesions
actually enhances the risk of developing cancer [33],
pointing at CAF transformation as a feature that can lead
to de novo tumorigenesis.
In addition we detect increased autophagy, ketone
production and senescence in chemotherapy-treated
stromal fibroblasts. Autophagic hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts,
generated by over-expression of autophagy promoters,
such as cathepsin B, and senescent hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts,
generated via over-expression of CDK inhibitors, such as
p21, are able to enhance tumour growth and metastasis
when co-injected with breast cancer cells in vivo [34, 35].
Moreover, ketogenic fibroblasts stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis in the neighbouring cancer cells [36], and upregulation in ketogenic enzyme expression has recently
been correlated with therapy failure [37]. Finally, systemic
ketogenesis and high stromal senescence are commonly
associated with tumorigenesis [38, 39]. Likewise a chronic
inflammatory microenvironment also contributes to all
tumorigenic stages such as the induction of neoplasticrelated mutations, resistance to apoptosis or metastasis
[40, 41]. The IL6/STAT3 pathway is particularly
important in inflammation-related tumorigenesis [42].

Stromal metabolic stress enhances stemness,
antioxidant and immune response in cancer cells.
Is the catabolic stroma able to persuade partially
transformed cells into becoming fully malignant?
We finally sought to identify the mechanism by
which stromal cells may promote chemoresistance,
metastasis or de novo tumorigenesis using our co-culture
system. Strikingly, Shh signalling was predominantly
activated in breast cancer cells in contact with stromal
cells in response to chemotherapy, as well as Wnt, STAT3
and TGFβ pathways, which are involved in progenitor
and stem cell renewal, metabolism [46], metastasis and
chemoresistance [47]. Abnormal activation of Shh, Wnt

signalling. B. In contact with these catabolic fibroblasts, cancer cells react to chemotherapy by activating antioxidant and immune response

and TGFβ signalling is found in many types of cancer
[48, 49]. In fact, de novo mutational activation of Shh
pathway by itself can result in cancer [49], and it is also
involved in the synergy of cancer and stromal cells, as
stromal hh production stimulates neoplastic proliferation
and metastasis [50], and tumour-secreted hh ligands in
turn induce CAF transformation generating a tumourpromoting microenvironment [51]. Moreover, these
pathways are involved in cellular metabolism. When
STAT3 is found in the mitochondria enhances oxidative
phosphorylation, encouraging the growth of cancer
cells when over-expressed [52]. Wnt signalling also
increments oxidative phosphorylation in breast cancer
cells [53]. Interestingly, conditioned media from primary
tumour fibroblasts or co-cultures with fibroblasts reduces
chemotherapy efficacy due to improved mitochondrial
function in the cancer cells [3], implying that upon therapy
stromal fibroblasts may support cancer cells in their
struggle for survival via stimulation of these stemness
pathways.
In the present study, we also observe that in
response to chemotherapy, Nrf1 and Nrf2-mediated
signalling is reactivated in MCF7 cancer cells in contact
with stromal fibroblasts. Several studies show constitutive
up-regulation of Nrf2 in many cancers, which provides a
growth advantage for cancer cells by protecting them from
anticancer agents [54, 55].
Finally, in response to chemotherapy we detect that
cancer cells in contact with stromal fibroblasts are able to
elicit interferon-mediated signalling. In fact, exposure to
chemotherapy in vivo induces recruitment of monocytic
cells and macrophages to tumours, which is associated
with cancer cell survival and poor therapy responsiveness
[56, 57]. TAMs gather in the tumour microenvironment in
response to cytokines such as Csf1, a STAT1 target gene.
Indeed, Stat1-null animals show reduced macrophage
infiltration [58], and in agreement with our findings, breast
cancer microarray analyses indicate that high mRNA
expression levels of Stat1 and its target genes belonging to
the interferon-mediated signalling correlate with poor drug
response and infiltration of immune cells, in particular
TAMs [59]. Hence, the response to a same stimulus is
cell context-dependent and different microenvironment
components participate in the development of malignancy
and chemoresistance. Likewise, not all drugs induce an
identical behavioural pattern. The diverse nature of the
anti-tumour agents, and the doses and the length of the
treatments selected for the study may account for these
differences.
So far, very little is known about the role of healthy
cells in the emergence of therapy-related malignancies.
Initiation of tumorigenesis by accumulation of genetic
changes is not sufficient for a tumour to develop, and
requires the emergence of a reactive microenvironment,
which via metabolic alterations and inflammation,
contributes to the progression of the tumour and leads
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to treatment failure [1]. Therefore, cancer initiates in the
tumour cell but gradually and systemically disseminates
driving catabolism in healthy tissues. The mechanisms by
which stromal metabolic stress controls the evolution of
malignancy or even the susceptibility of a premalignant
cell to become fully malignant are not understood. One
piece of evidence shows that pre-treatment of tumourfree mice with a single dose of doxorubicin is sufficient
to stimulate lung carcinoma cell engraftment and elevate
the mitogenic activity of the serum of treated animals [9].
Here, we propose a new model by which upon treatment,
stromal cells acquire a catabolic state that leads to an
autophagic, nutrient-rich, senescent, pro-inflammatory
microenvironment (Figure 9A), the ideal niche to
encourage carcinogenesis by stimulating stemness in
therapy-damaged pre-malignant epithelial cells and by
increasing inflammation and immune cell infiltration,
which in turn could further promote malignancy in these
cells (Figure 9B). Nevertheless, given that successfully
treating the primary cancer should always be a priority,
targeting stromal cells in combination with conventional
chemotherapy may help disrupting these ill-behaved
microenvironments, improving treatment efficacy and
avoiding future malignancies.

MATERIALs AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human foreskin fibroblasts immortalised with the
human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-BJ1), and
MCF7 breast cancer cells were purchased from ATCC and
maintained in DMEM (D6546, Sigma) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (F7524, Sigma), 100 units/ml of
penicillin, 100 µg/ml, streptomycin (P0781, Sigma) and
1% Glutamax (#35050087, Life Technologies). For all
experiments, cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37°C.

Chemotherapeutical agents
Azathioprine,
carboplatin,
cisplatin,
cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin,
5-fluorouracil,
gemcitabine,
methotrexate,
6-mercaptopurine,
mitoxantrone, 6-thioguanine and taxol were used in this
study. See Table 1 for details. Untreated and vehicletreated cells were analysed in all experiments.

Sulforhodamine b (SRB) assay
SRB (S9012, Sigma) measures total biomass by
staining cellular proteins. After treatment, cells were
fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid (T9159, Sigma) for
10740

Oncotarget

1h at 4°C, stained with SRB (S9012, Sigma) for 15
minutes, and washed 3 times with 1% acetic acid (27225,
Sigma). The incorporated die was solubilised with 10
mM Tris Base, pH 8.8 (T1503, Sigma). Absorbance was
spectrophotometrically measured at 562 nm in a FluoStar
Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Background
measurements were subtracted from all values.

oligomycin and 100 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) were
injected into the media at different time points and ECAR
was measured (Figure S2A). Likewise, ECAR and OCR
were quantified using un-buffered DMEM XF medium
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 2 mM sodium
pyruvate and 10 mM glucose (Figure S2B). Cells were
stained with SRB to normalise results. All parameters
were calculated according to manufacturer.

L-lactate assay, β-hydroxybutyrate assay, glucose
consumption

Levels of reactive oxygen species, autophagic
vesicles and senescence

1.5 x 105 hTERT-BJ1 cells per well were seeded in
a 12 well plate. When cells were attached, drug treatments
were added in triplicate for 48 or 72 h. Media was then
collected. L-lactate was measured using the L-Lactate
Assay Kit (735-10, Trinity Biotech) and β-hydroxybutyrate
(β-HB) was determined with the β-HB Assay Kit (K632,
Biovision), according to the manufacturer. L-lactate and
β-HB production were calculated by subtracting the levels
of L-lactate or β-HB in complete media from those in
each sample. Glucose concentration was quantified using
a FreeStyle Optium Glucose Meter (Abbott). Glucose
consumption was calculated by subtracting the levels of
glucose in each sample from those in complete media. For
all assays, viable cells in each well for each time point
were counted using Trypan Blue (T8154, Sigma) and used
to normalize all results.

For all assays, 1.5 x 105 hTERT-BJ1 cells per well
were seeded in 12-well plates. When cells were attached,
drug treatments were added for 24, 48 or 72 h in triplicate.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured
using CM-H2DCFDA (C6827, Invitrogen). Cells were
incubated for 20 min at 37°C with 1 μM CM-H2DCFDA
diluted in PBS, and then placed in complete media for
20 min at 37°C in the dark, to render the die fluorescent,
according to the manufacturer. Autophagy Detection Kit
(ab139484, Abcam) was used to detect autophagic vesicle
production. Cells were trypsinised and incubated for 30
min at RT in the dark with a solution containing 1:1000
of Green Detection Reagent and 1:1000 of Hoechst in
phenol-red free DMEM (D5921, Sigma) supplemented
with 5% FBS, according to the manufacturer. Senescent
cells were detected using the fluorescent senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity marker
C12FDG (F1930, Molecular Probes). Cells were
trypsinised and incubated with 2 mM of FDG substrate at
37°C for 1 minute. Staining was terminated by hypotonic
shock by diluting the cells into ice-cold isotonic medium,
according to the manufacturer.
ROS signal, autophagy vesicle signal, and SA-βgal activity signal were quantified as mean fluorescent
intensity of the viable cell population in a BD LSRII flow
cytometer (BD Bioscience). Results were analysed using
FlowJo software.

ATP content
ATP content was measured using CellTiter-Glo
(G7570, Promega) and ATP standards (A1852, Sigma). 2 ×
104 hTERT-BJ1 cells were seeded in black-walled 96 well
plates. When cells were attached, drug treatments were
added for 24, 48 or 72 h. Six replicates were used for each
condition. Media was removed and CellTiter-Glo Assay
was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Light signal was acquired in the Xenogen VivoVision
IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life Sciences). Results were
normalised by SRB staining. ATP levels were calculated
by extrapolating from the standard curve.

Western blotting

Extracellular flux analysis

1 x 106 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were seeded in 10
cm dishes. When cells were attached, drug treatments
were added for 48 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis
buffer (R0278, Sigma) containing proteinase inhibitors
(05 892 970 001, Roche) and kept at 4°C for 20 minutes
with rotation. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for
10 minutes at 10,000 xg and supernatants were collected.
Equal amounts of protein lysate, as determined by using
the BCA protein assay kit (23225, Pierce) were diluted
in SDS sample buffer and dry-boiled for 5 minutes
before being separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% gels
(456-1094, Biorad). Samples were then blotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (170-4159, Biorad), blocked

Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) were measured in a XF96
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences). 1.5 ×
104 hTERT-BJ1 cells per well were seeded in XF96 plates
and incubated with complete medium. When cells were
attached, drug treatments were added. Six replicates were
run for each condition. After 72 h of drug treatments, unbuffered DMEM XF medium supplemented with 2 mM
glutamine (pH 7.4) was added to the cells, and placed in
a 37°C CO2-free incubator for 1h. 10 mM glucose, 1 µM

When cells were attached, drug treatments were added
for 72 h in duplicate. Equal amounts of culture media,
as determined by using the BCA protein assay kit, were
loaded into the ELISA plate and incubated with the
antibody overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking. Standards
and media samples were run in parallel. Absorbance
was spectrophotometrically measured at 450 nm in a
FluoStar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Background
measurements were subtracted from all values. Finally,
IL6 levels were calculated by extrapolating from the
standard curve.

in 5% milk in TBS-Tween 20 (P9416, Sigma) for 1h and
probed with antibodies against α-tubulin (ab4074, Abcam),
p-SAPK/JNK (T183-Y185) (4668S, Cell Signalling), P-cJun (S63) (926L1, Cell Signalling), total JNK (9252S,
Cell Signalling), total c-Jun (2315S, Cell Signalling),
p53 (OP43, Calbiochem), p21 (sc-756, Santa Cruz), and
α-SMA (sc-53142, Santa Cruz). Bound antibodies were
detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (ab6789 and ab6721, Abcam)
and signal was obtained using Supersignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (34087, ThermoScientific).
Pictures were taken in a ChemiDoc XRS with Image Lab
Software (BioRad).

Lentivirus infection

Immunofluorescence

The Cignal Lenti reporter assay (luc) was used to
monitor the activity of several signalling pathways in
either hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts or MCF7-GFP cells (see
Table 2 for details). Viral particles diluted 1:10 in complete
media containing polybrene (sc-134220, Santa Cruz) were
added to the cells. Puromycin treatment (P9620, Sigma)
was added 48 h later in order to stably select infected cells.

1.5 x 105 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts per well were
seeded in coverslips in 12 well plates. When cells
were attached, drug treatments were added for 72 h in
triplicate. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
(28908, Thermo Scientific) in PBS for 20 minutes at RT,
permeabilised in -20°C-cold methanol for 5 minutes at
4°C, quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 10 minutes,
rinsed and blocked with IF buffer consisting of 1% BSA
(A3608, Sigma) plus 0.1% Tween 20 (P9416, Sigma) in
PBS for 1h. Cells were then incubated for 1h with the
MCT4 primary antibody (sc-50329, Santa Cruz). The
fluorescent secondary antibody was added for 30 minutes.
Cells were counterstained with DAPI and samples were
mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (P36934,
Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence pictures were taken in
a Leica gated Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy
(gSTED) with additional confocal and multi-photon
illumination (room rg106).

Luciferase assay
Luciferase Assay System (E1501, Promega) was
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. 2 ×
104 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were seeded in black-walled
96 well plates. When cells were attached, drug treatments
were added for 24, 48 and 72 h. Six replicates were used
for each condition. After treatment, Luciferase Assay
was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions
and light signal was acquired in the Xenogen VivoVision
IVIS Lumina. Results were normalized by SRB staining.
Likewise, 6 × 103 MCF7-GFP cells were seeded in blackwalled 96-well plates as single cultures or in combination
with 6 × 103 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts. When cells were
attached, drug treatments were added for 24 and 48 h
in quadruplicate. After treatment, GFP fluorescence
was measured in the plates and Luciferase Assay was
performed as before. Results were normalised by GFP
fluorescence.

Cytokine antibody array
Cytokine human membrane antibody array (Abcam,
ab133998) was used as to screen cytokine secretion (N=1).
1 x 106 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were seeded in 10 cm
plates until cells were attached and doxorubicin or vehicle
were added to the cells for 72 h. Culture media was then
placed on the membrane. The dot blot array was developed
using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate.
Pictures were taken in the ChemiDoc XRS with Image
Lab Software and ImageJ software was used to quantify
the intensity of the dots. Internal membrane loading
controls were used to normalise results.

Statistical analyses
Student’s t test was used for statistical comparison
of two groups. All data are reported as mean ± standard
deviation of the mean (SEM). All experiments were
repeated at least two times with reproducible results. P
values lower than 0.05 were considered significant (*P <
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Microsoft Excel was
used to produce all graphs.

Interleukin 6 ELISA
Interleukin 6 (IL6) concentration was determined
using IL6 Human ELISA Kit (ab100572, Abcam). 3 x
105 hTERT-BJ1 fibroblasts were seeded in 6 well plates.
