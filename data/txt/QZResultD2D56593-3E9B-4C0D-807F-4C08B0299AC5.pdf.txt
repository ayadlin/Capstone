Abstract
Low antigen expression and an absence of coimmunostimulatory signals may be partly responsible for the low
immunogenicity of many tumors. It may be possible to overcome this situation by defining a combination of
adjuvants and antigens that can activate a high-avidity antitumor response. Using the poorly immunogenic B16OVA melanoma cells as tumor model, we tested different combinations of adjuvants and antigens to treat
established tumors. In the absence of exogenous antigens, repeated administration of the TLR7 ligand
Imiquimod together with anti-CD40 agonistic antibodies activated only innate immunity, which was insufficient
to reject intradermal tumors. Administering this adjuvant combination together with OVA as a tumor antigen
induced T-cell responses that delayed tumor growth. However, administering a combination of anti-CD40 plus
TLR3 and TLR7 ligands, together with antigen targeting to dendritic cells through TLR4, was sufficient to induce
tumor rejection in 50% of mice. This response was associated with a greater activation of innate immunity and
induction of high-avidity polyfunctional CD8þ T-cell responses, which each contributed to tumor rejection. This
therapy activated T-cell responses not only against OVA, which conferred protection against a rechallenge with
B16-OVA cells, but also activated T-cell responses against other melanoma-associated antigens. Our findings
support the concept that multiple adjuvant combination and antigen targeting may be a useful immunotherapeutic strategy against poorly immunogenic tumors. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3214–24. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor immunotherapy is aimed at inducing immune
responses to destroy tumor cells (1). However, tumors usually
behave as poorly immunogenic for T cells, because as opposed
to professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells
(DC), they express low levels of antigens, MHC, and costimulatory molecules (2). Moreover, unlike danger signals associated with pathogens, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands,
or inflammatory signals (cytokines or CD40L expressed on
activated CD4 T cells), which induce DC maturation, tumor
cells do not release immunogenic danger signals, unless they
are submitted to radio- or chemotherapy (3). DC maturation,
which involves upregulation of costimulatory, adhesion, and
antigen-presenting molecules as well as the production of

cytokines and chemokines, is necessary for correct T-cell
activation (4). Therefore, to overcome the low tumor immunogenicity, new therapeutic strategies are based on the use of
adjuvants (molecules able to induce DC maturation) with or
without exogenously added tumor antigens, which will activate DC to properly present tumor antigens to T cells and
trigger their effector functions (5). With this aim, a great effort
has been made to characterize DC-activating ligands to be
used as adjuvant molecules, due to their immunostimulatory
and/or targeting properties, and thus avoid the use of microorganisms containing undefined adjuvant mixtures (6). These
activating molecules have been shown to increase the immunostimulatory properties of DC by signaling through different
activation pathways, and in some cases, synergistic effects
have been observed (7–11). Thus, development of therapeutic
strategies based on the use of molecularly defined components is a main goal in tumor immunology.
We had previously shown that administration of an adjuvant mixture containing the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) and agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies, together with ovalbumin (OVA)
as tumor antigen, protected mice against the growth of E.G7OVA thymoma and rejected established tumors in this model
(12). B16 melanoma cell lines (13) are poorly immunogenic
tumors which have many characteristics of tumors found
in patients and consequently, may be a good model to
develop immunotherapeutic strategies with potential clinical

Adjuvant Combination to Induce Antitumor Responses

applications. Several approaches have been used to induce
immune responses able to reject B16 melanoma. They are
based on the use of DC pulsed or expressing different types of
antigens (14–16) or complex immunogens such as recombinant viruses, bacteria, or virus-like particles which contain
many DC-activating signals (17–19). All these data prompted
us to develop an immunotherapeutic strategy to treat B16OVA established tumors using combinations of adjuvants and
antigens. We report below the antitumor efficacy of this
strategy, together with the immunological mechanisms
responsible of its outcome.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Peptides OVA(257–264) and TRP-2(180–188) were synthesized in an automatic APEX 396 multiple peptide synthesizer
(Aapptec LLC). Peptide identity was confirmed by mass
spectrometry and their purity was >95%, as determined by
HPLC. OVA protein was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Proteins containing the extra domain A from fibronectin
EDA and EDA-OVA were produced as described (20). Endotoxin levels in these proteins were below 0.2 EU/mg protein as
analyzed using the LAL test (Cambrex). Imiquimod was used
in vivo as Aldara cream (Meda Pharma) and for in vitro
experiments was obtained from Invivogen. Poly(I:C) was
obtained from Amersham and agonistic anti-CD40 antibody
was purified from FGK45.5 hybridoma cells as described (12).
Mice
Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old; Harlan) were maintained in pathogen-free conditions and treated according to
guidelines of our institution, after study approval by the review
committee.
Cell lines
Parental EL-4 thymoma cells, OVA-transfected E.G7-OVA
cells, and the NK-sensitive cell line YAC-1 were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection and were grown as
described (21). Cells were thawed and passaged according to
ATCC guidelines for less than 6 months from the time they
were received or thawed. ATCC authenticates cell lines by
DNA fingerprinting by short tandem repeat analysis. B16-OVA
(22) and B16.F10 tumor cells (13), obtained from Dr. G.
Kroemer, were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf
serum and antibiotics. No authentication was done, but the
expression of OVA and TRP-2 antigens and MHC-I molecules
was tested before the experiments by RT-PCT and flow
cytometry, respectively.
Immunization of mice
Naïve mice received combinations of Imiquimod cream
(topical application; 2.5 mg/mouse) plus subcutaneous
administration of poly(I:C; 50 mg/mouse), anti-CD40 (50 mg/
mouse), OVA protein (2–11 nmol/mouse), EDA (2 nmol/
mouse), or EDA-OVA protein (2 nmol/mouse). Six days later,
animals were killed and splenocytes were obtained for immunological analysis.

Tumor treatment experiments
Mice were injected intradermally with 105 tumor cells and
when the tumor diameter reached 4 to 5 mm, treatment
protocols containing combinations of the following adjuvants
and antigens were applied in a 20-day protocol: Imiquimod
cream was topically applied daily (2.5 mg/mouse) to shaved
skin at the tumor site, whereas poly(I:C; 50 mg/mouse), antiCD40 (50 mg/mouse), OVA protein (11 nmol/mouse) and EDAOVA protein (2 nmol/mouse) were administered intratumor
(i.t.) 3 times per week. Untreated mice challenged with tumor
cells were used as positive controls of tumor growth. In some
cases, tumor treatment was accompanied by administration
of 200 mg of depleting anti-CD8, anti-NK1.1 or isotype control
antibodies on days 1, 0, 2, 4 and 6, being 0 the day when
treatment starts. Tumor volume was calculated according to
the formula: V ¼ (length  width2)/2. Mice were killed when
tumor diameter reached 17 mm.
Ex vivo analysis of DC
Mice bearing 4 to 5 mm tumors (n ¼ 5) received a single
administration of different adjuvant combinations as
described earlier, and 1 day later tumors or tumor-draining
lymph nodes were removed, pooled, and DC analyzed directly
by flow cytometry or by real-time PCR after purification with
anti-CD11c–conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi).
Analysis by real-time PCR
Total RNA extraction from tumor cell lines or dendritic cells
and real-time PCR were performed as described (23), using
primers shown in Supplementary Table S1. Results were
normalized according to b-actin. The amount of each transcript was expressed by the formula: 2DCt [DCt ¼ Ct
(b-actin)  Ct(gene)].
ELISPOT
Cells producing IFN-g were enumerated by ELISPOT assays
using a kit from BD-Biosciences as described (12). For T-cell
responses, splenocytes were stimulated with peptides OVA
(257–264; 1 mg/mL), TRP-2 (180–188; 10 mg/mL), OVA protein
(10 mg/mL) or 4  104 irradiated (20,000 rads) tumor cells.
When measuring NK-cell–derived production of IFN-g, splenocytes were incubated with 4  104 mitomycin C–treated
YAC-1 cells.
Flow cytometry
Expression of MHC Kb class I molecules in tumor cells was
analyzed using anti–Kb-FITC labeled antibodies. To analyze
NK cells and DC, spleens, tumor-draining lymph nodes or
tumors were treated with collagenase and DNAse for 15
minutes and homogenized. Then, cells were first incubated
for 10 minutes with Fc Block (BD-Biosciences) and stained
with specific antibodies. For NK cell analysis, cells were
stained with anti–CD69-FITC, anti–CD3-PE and anti–
NK1.1-APC–labeled antibodies. DC were analyzed using
anti–CD11c-APC, anti-IAb (either PE or FITC), anti–CD86FITC, anti–CD80-FITC, and anti–CCR7-PE antibodies. To
measure IL-12 production, DC were incubated for 5 hours
with GolgiStop and after fixation and permeabilization were

labeled with anti–CD11c-APC, anti–IAb-FITC, and anti–IL-12
p70-PE. OVA(257–264)/H-2Kb tetramer-specific T cells were
enumerated as described (21), using a 1/1000 tetramer dilution. T-cell activation was analyzed after stimulation of splenocytes with 1 ng/mL of OVA(257–264) in the presence of
GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD-Biosciences) with or without
anti–CD107-FITC antibodies for 4 hours. Then cells were
labeled with anti–CD8-APC and fixed, permeabilized, and
stained with anti–IFN-g-PE. For triple cytokine analysis, after
surface staining with anti–CD8-FITC, cells were stained with
anti–IFN-g-PE, anti–TNF-a-PE-Cy7, and anti–IL-2-APC
labeled antibodies. All antibodies were from BD-Biosciences,
except anti-NK1.1 (e-Bioscience). Expression of the different
markers was analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) and Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Measurement of cytokines by ELISA
IL-12 and TNF-a content in the serum obtained from the
retroorbital plexus of mice, and IFN-g from 48 hours culture
supernatants of splenocytes stimulated with different concentrations of OVA(257–264) were measured using OptEIA
Sets from BD-Biosciences.
Statistical analysis
Survival curves of animals treated with different protocols
were plotted according to the Kaplan–Meier method and were
compared using the log-rank test. Immune responses were
analyzed using nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–
Whitney U tests. P < 0.05 was taken to represent statistical
significance.

Results
Immunotherapy based only on adjuvant administration has
a poor effect on B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice, inducing
innate but not adaptive immunity
We have previously reported that a single prophylactic
administration of adjuvant molecules poly(I:C) and agonistic
anti-CD40 antibodies plus OVA protein induced potent T-cell
responses which protected 100% of mice from the growth of
subcutaneous E.G7-OVA tumors (12). When this protocol was
applied to the B16-OVA melanoma model, no differences in
tumor growth and survival were observed between control
and vaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), demonstrating the poor immunogenicity and recognition of B16-OVA
cells. Indeed, OVA expression of B16-OVA cells was very low,
as compared with E.G7-OVA cells, and the same low expression was obtained for MHC class I Kb molecules (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). This prompted us to adopt the poorly
immunogenic B16-OVA tumor model to develop therapeutic
strategies.
Because repeated intratumor administration of poly(I:C)
and anti-CD40 rejected 35% of established E.G7-OVA tumors
(12), we decided to test the therapeutic efficacy of repeated
adjuvant administration on the B16-OVA tumor model. In
these experiments, we combined topical application of Aldara
cream (containing the TLR7 ligand Imiquimod) and intratumor injection of anti-CD40 antibodies. Mice bearing 7-day

3216

intradermal tumors (5 mm) received repeated adjuvant
administrations in a 20-day interval. As shown in Figure
1A, treated mice had a slight delay (P < 0.05) in tumor growth,
but all mice died by day 40.
Rejection of E.G7-OVA tumors after administration of poly
(I:C) plus anti-CD40 was associated with the induction of
innate and adaptive immunity (12). Therefore, we studied
these parameters when using Imiquimod and anti-CD40 as
adjuvants. Naïve mice received a single administration of
Imiquimod plus anti-CD40 and NK cell activity was studied
by measuring CD69 upregulation on CD3NK1.1þ cells and
IFN-g production against the NK-sensitive YAC-1 cell line. A
high activity in both functions was found at 24 hours (Fig. 1B).
Regarding spleen DC, a clear upregulation of CD86 was
observed (Fig. 1C). Finally, analysis of serum cytokines showed
a peak for IL-12 at 6 hours (226 pg/mL), whereas TNF-a levels
grew until 48 hours (625 pg/mL).
Analysis of antitumor adaptive immune responses was
carried out in tumor-bearing mice, untreated or treated with
Imiquimod plus anti-CD40. None of these groups displayed
IFN-g production against the CD8 T-cell epitope OVA(257–
264) or OVA protein in ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1D). These results
suggest that administration of adjuvants to B16-OVA tumorbearing mice induces innate but not adaptive immunity.
Combination of adjuvants Imiquimod and anti-CD40
with the tumor antigen OVA induces adaptive
immunity with better antitumor effects
The lack of adaptive immunity in B16-OVA-tumor bearing
mice treated with adjuvants alone led us to hypothesize that
inclusion of an antigen together with adjuvants might be able
to induce T-cell responses. Indeed, repeated administration of
OVA together with poly(I:C) and anti-CD40 enhanced E.G7OVA tumor rejection from 35% to 100% (12). Immunization of
naïve mice with OVA plus the adjuvant combination Imiquimod and anti-CD40 had a strong effect on the induction of Tcell responses (Fig. 2A), similar to responses observed when
combining OVA plus poly(I:C) and anti-CD40 (12). We thus
treated tumor-bearing mice with OVA plus Imiquimod and
anti-CD40 3 times per week during a 20-day period. In this
case, tumor volume was kept below 0.5 cm3 during the
treatment period, as compared to untreated animals, which
at day 20 had a mean tumor volume above 1 cm3 (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2B). Moreover, only 33% of untreated mice were alive at
the end of treatment (day 20), whereas 100% of treated mice
survived (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C). Also, as opposed to mice treated
only with adjuvants (Fig. 1A), once treatment finished, animals
treated with OVA plus Imiquimod and anti-CD40 had slowgrowing tumors until day 30, when they started to grow and
finally all mice died at day 40. We also analyzed the antitumor
effect of OVA plus the combination of poly(I:C) and anti-CD40,
a similar T-cell activation strategy (12) which induced rejection of E.G7-OVA tumors. Equivalent results were obtained in
these experiments, with a significant delay in tumor growth
(P < 0.01), but without tumor rejection (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
The lack of tumor rejection in treated animals could not
be attributed to the absence of T-cell responses, because

Figure 1. Immunotherapy based only on adjuvant administration has a poor effect of B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. A, C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 6) were injected
s.c. with 105 B16-OVA tumor cells and when tumor diameter reached 5 mm they were treated 3 times per week during a 20-day period with Imiquimod
þ anti-CD40 or left untreated. Graph represents average tumor volume per group of animals studied and survival (*, P < 0.05, untreated vs. Imiquimod

CD69 upregulation in CD3NK1.1þ cells (filled bars) and as IFN-g production against the NK-cell–sensitive YAC-1 cell line (open bars). C, activation of
splenic DC in animals shown in B was measured as % of CD86þ cells in the CD11cþ population. D, mice (n ¼ 3) with 7-day tumors were treated twice
2 days apart with Imiquimod plus anti-CD40 or left untreated and 1 week after first treatment recognition of peptide OVA(257–264) and OVA protein by
splenocytes was measured by ELISPOT. Results are representative of 2 independent experiments.

tumor-bearing mice treated with as few as 2 immunizations
showed clear responses against tumor antigens (a representative example of mice treated with OVA plus Imiquimod and
anti-CD40 is shown in Fig. 2D). Thus, a protocol which
combines the tumor antigen with double-adjuvant mixtures
induces T-cell responses, delays tumor growth during treatment period and some days beyond, but does not lead to
tumor rejection.
Multiple adjuvant combination and antigen targeting
enhances innate immunity
The poor but significant effect that antigen plus adjuvant
administration had on tumor growth suggested that new
strategies inducing enhanced T-cell responses might be more
suitable to attain tumor rejection. Thus, looking for a higher
synergistic effect between adjuvants, all 3 molecules (antiCD40, poly(I:C) and Imiquimod) were included in a multiple
adjuvant combination (MAC). Moreover, to enhance not only
innate immunity, but also to target antigen to antigen presenting cells, OVA was coupled to the extra domain A of
fibronectin (EDA), a TLR4 ligand which enhances innate and
adaptive immunity, and when coupled to antigens, targets
them to TLR4-expressing antigen presenting cells (20). Con-

cerning the activation of innate immunity, in vitro experiments using bone marrow-derived DC from naïve mice
stimulated with the different combinations showed that
MAC þ EDA induced the highest levels of mRNA corresponding to costimulatory molecules associated with T-cell activation and cytokines important for induction of CD8 T-cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Most importantly, ex vivo analysis of
tumor-draining lymph node DC from mice treated with
different combinations showed that MAC or EDAþMAC
induced the highest CD80 and CD86 expression levels, as
occurred with IL-12 and the chemokine receptor CCR7, in
accordance with the higher numbers of DC found (Fig. 3A).
Equivalent results were obtained analyzing mRNA of costimulatory molecules, IL-15 and IL-15R (P < 0.05; MAC or EDA þ
MAC vs. remaining groups; Fig. 3B). Administration of EDA
without additional adjuvants had a negligible effect on these
parameters. No clear differences were observed when analyzing tumor DC (data not shown), probably due to migration of
activated DC to draining lymph nodes.
Ex vivo analysis of NK cell activation, after a single administration of adjuvant combinations to naïve mice showed that,
EDA-OVA þ MAC induced the strongest NK-cell derived IFN-g
production of the 4 combinations tested (Supplementary Fig. S3;

When adjuvants were administered to tumor-bearing mice,
MAC and EDA þ MAC were the most potent combinations
(P < 0.05; MAC or EDA þ MAC vs. remaining groups; Fig. 3C).
Multiple adjuvant combination and antigen targeting
induces polyfunctional high avidity T-cell responses
Analysis of adaptive immunity in naïve mice immunized
with the different combinations was done by ELISPOT
assays which measured the number of CD8 and CD4 T-cells
producing IFN-g against OVA(257–264) peptide and OVA
protein, respectively. EDA-OVA þ MAC showed a synergistic
effect, as compared with immunization with OVA plus triple
or double adjuvant combinations (Fig. 4A; P < 0.01; EDAOVA þ MAC vs. remaining groups). Antigen coupling to
EDA was necessary to obtain these high responses, because
immunization with MAC plus EDA and free OVA induced
lower responses, mainly for those mediated by CD8 T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Besides quantitative parameters of T-cell activation, the
quality of the CD8 T-cell responses was studied by stimulating
splenocytes with decreasing OVA(257–264) concentrations.

Figure 2. Combination of
adjuvants Imiquimod þ anti-CD40
with the tumor antigen OVA
induces adaptive immunity with
better antitumor effects. A,
C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 3) received a
single immunization with OVA þ
Imiquimod þ anti-CD40 or were
left untreated. Six days later, they
were killed and the number of IFNg–producing cells after stimulation
with OVA antigens was measured
by ELISPOT. C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 6)
were injected s.c. with 105 B16OVA tumor cells and when tumor
diameter reached 5 mm they were
treated 3 times per week during a
20-day period with OVA þ
Imiquimod þ anti-CD40. Average
tumor volume per group of
animals studied (B) and survival
(C) are represented. Mice (n ¼ 2)
bearing 5 mm tumors received 2
administrations of OVA þ
Imiquimod þ anti-CD40 and
6 days after the first injection their
splenocytes were stimulated with
OVA antigens and IFNg–producing cells were measured
by ELISPOT (D). Results are
representative of 2 independent
experiments.

Interestingly, splenocytes from mice immunized with EDAOVA þ MAC and stimulated with concentrations as low as 0.1
to 1 ng/mL of OVA(257–264) still produced high amounts of
IFN-g (Fig. 4B), as compared to the other groups. These higher
IFN-g levels were due not only to a expansion of high-avidity
OVA(257–264)-specific T-cells, as found by staining with low
OVA(257–264)/Kb tetramer concentrations, but also to
enhanced activation of IFN-g–producing cells, as demonstrated in ELISPOT assays using 0.1 ng/mL of peptide
(Fig. 4C). Finally, other qualitative aspects were analyzed at
the single cell level by studying polyfunctional CD8 T-cells
(cells producing several cytokines and displaying different
effector functions). These analyses were carried out on
high-avidity T cells, by stimulating splenocytes with 1 ng/
mL of OVA(257–264). First, a higher number of CD8 T cells
with lytic activity against OVA(257–264), determined by the
expression of CD107, was found in splenocytes from mice
immunized with EDA-OVA þ MAC; and second, these animals
had the highest percentage of CD8 T cells simultaneously
producing IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 (Fig. 4D). These results
suggest that immunization with EDA-OVA þ MAC induces
stronger responses with a higher avidity for the antigen, which
are able to display several effector functions.

Figure 3. In vivo activation of innate immunity by a multiple adjuvant combination. C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 5/group) were injected s.c. with 105 B16-OVA
tumor cells and when tumor diameter reached 5 mm they were treated with different adjuvant combinations. One day later, tumor-draining lymph
nodes were removed and pooled. A, expression of CD80, CD86, CCR7, IL-12 p70 molecules in the DC population, defined as CD11cþIAbþ, as well as the
number of DC, were measured by flow cytometry. B, expression of mRNA of costimulatory molecules, IL-15 and IL-15R were measured by real-time PCR in DC
(n ¼ 5 wells/group) purified with magnetic beads. C, NK cells were analyzed as the percentage of activated NK cells (CD69þ in NK1.1þCD3 cells) and by
IFN-g production against the NK-sensitive cell line YAC-1 in ELISPOT (n ¼ 5 wells/group). Results correspond to 1 of 2 independent experiments.

With these results, we measured immune responses against
tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice treated during 10 days with
the different combinations. Mice treated with EDA-OVA þ
MAC had the lowest tumor size at day 10 and the highest
proportion of tumor-free mice (Supplementary Fig. S5), in
agreement with the ability of their splenocytes to recognize in

vitro B16-OVA tumor cells (Fig. 4D), as well as B16.F10 cells. By
contrast, a lower or nil recognition by splenocytes from
remaining groups was observed. No differences in OVA
expression were observed in tumors belonging to groups
treated with different adjuvant combinations (Supplementary
Fig. S5).

EDA-OVA þ MAC administration induces B16-OVA
tumor rejection mediated by CD8þ cells
EDA-OVA þ MAC, characterized as the best combination to
induce innate and adaptive immune responses, was used to
treat B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice in long-term experiments.
In mice treated with this strategy, tumor growth was completely blocked until day 30, whereas all untreated mice had
already died by day 28. Moreover, beyond this day, tumor
growth rate was slower in the treated group, and half of mice
rejected their tumor and still survived at day 80 (P < 0.001;
EDA-OVA þ MAC vs. UT; Fig. 5A and B).

Administration of EDA-OVA þ MAC s.c. at a distal site
almost blocked tumor growth for 2 weeks, but as opposed to
intratumor administration, all tumors grew after treatment,
suggesting that local administration was required to maintain
the beneficial effect (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The relevance of effector populations on tumor rejection
induced by EDA-OVA þ MAC administration was studied by
depleting CD8 and NK cells in tumor-bearing mice before
treatment. These experiments (Fig. 5D) showed that CD8
depletion abrogated most of the beneficial effect provided

on tumor growth, in agreement with a decrease of 15% to 20%
in the induction of CD8 responses when using mice depleted

finally observed in survival (P ¼ 0.77; NK-depleted vs. Isotype).
These results suggest that CD8 cells are the main effector

Administration of EDA-OVAþMAC to tumor-bearing
mice induces T-cell responses against different tumor
antigens
To analyze the role of the different tumor antigens recognized by T-cells, at day 80 (60 days after finishing treatment),
re-challenge experiments were carried out in surviving animals. None of cured animals after treatment with EDA-OVA þ
MAC developed tumors when re-challenged with B16-OVA
cells, whereas a quick tumor growth was observed in control
untreated mice. Moreover, when equivalent mice cured after
treatment with EDA-OVA þ MAC were re-challenged with
B16.F10 tumor cells, which do not express OVA, 80% of mice
remained tumor free (Fig. 6A). Study of responses against
tumor antigens expressed by B16-OVA tumor cells in cured
mice showed that they not only recognized OVA, but also the
melanoma antigen TRP-2 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that this treatment not only induces responses against the administered
antigen, but also against other antigens expressed by tumor
cells. Indeed, in agreement with results shown in Figure 5, as
early as 10 days after starting treatment, responses against
TRP-2(180–188) peptide were observed in mice receiving EDAOVA þ MAC or OVA þ MAC (Fig. 6C). This prompted us to see
the efficacy of a new therapy based on administration of MAC
plus EDA fused to fragment 59–257 of TRP-2 (EDA-TRP2), a
protein that activates innate and adaptive immunity (Supplementary Fig. S8). As shown in Figure 6D, all untreated animals
died by day 13, whereas 30% of mice treated with EDA-TRP2 þ
MAC still survived at day 40 (P < 0.001; EDA-TRP2 þ MAC vs.
UT).

The failure of many preclinical immunotherapeutic strategies when applied to patients is partially related to the poor
immunogenicity of human tumors, as opposed to malignant
cells used in animal models that are usually more immunogenic. Thus, protection or tumor rejection could not be
achieved in the B16-OVA tumor model using a mixture containing OVA plus poly(I:C) and anti-CD40, a successful protocol used in the E.G7-OVA model. Indeed, B16-OVA cells
express much lower levels of OVA antigen and MHC molecules, as compared to E.G7-OVA cells, which would impair
tumor recognition and rejection by antigen-specific T cells.
Thus, using this poorly immunogenic model, we have analyzed
the efficacy of different immunotherapeutic strategies based
on the use of different adjuvant combinations, with or without
tumor antigens. As opposed to the E.G7-OVA, B16-OVA
tumors are not rejected after repeated administration of
different double-adjuvant combinations. Adjuvant administration in the former model induces both innate and adaptive

immunity, whereas in the latter, only innate immune
responses can be detected. The low levels of tumor antigen
expressed and/or released by B16-OVA cells which are available for presentation to T cells after activation of innate
immune cells, probably account for the lack of induction of
T-cell responses. This hypothesis is reinforced by the finding
that tumor growth is slower only during the treatment period,
probably due to innate immunity primed by adjuvants, and
increases after treatment.
Inclusion of the antigen OVA with Imiquimod and antiCD40, or with poly(I:C) and anti-CD40, induced T-cell
responses in naïve and tumor-bearing mice, and tumor
growth was delayed several days beyond the end of treatment,
suggesting that the induction of T-cell responses has additional but not sufficient antitumor effect. To overcome the
poor efficacy of these protocols, we used a multiple adjuvant

combination containing Imiquimod, poly(I:C), anti-CD40 as
well as EDA coupled to OVA, which acts as adjuvant through
TLR4 and targets the antigen to antigen presenting cells. In
this case, tumor rejection was observed in half of treated
animals, associated with a clear improvement of the immune
response induced by treatment. A synergy between different
adjuvants has been reported in vitro and in vivo for DC (7, 8, 10,
11, 24), mainly for those receptors which do not share signaling pathways. Thus, we used poly(I:C), which binds to TLR3
(25) and triggers the TRIF pathway, Imiquimod, which uses
TLR7 with Myd88 as adaptor molecule (26), anti-CD40, which
triggers a TRAF-dependent pathway (27), and EDA, able to
bind to TLR4, a receptor connected to the TRIF and Myd88
pathways (28). Although EDAþMAC induced the highest
upregulation of costimulatory molecules as well as cytokines
associated with T-cell activation on DC in vitro, both MAC and

Adjuvant Combination to Induce Antitumor Responses

EDAþMAC induced the highest DC activation in vivo in
tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, enhancing effects were
observed not only on antigen-presenting cells, which concomitantly affect T-cell responses, but also on NK cells, which in
turn may also help the induction of Th1 T-cell responses.
Indeed, when using this adjuvant combination, NK cells are
partially responsible for the induction of IFN-g–producing
CD8 T cells. The lack of tumor rejection in mice treated at a
distal site suggests that local effect of adjuvants is necessary
for tumor rejection, because it may activate innate immunity
with direct inflammatory and antitumor effects which also
collaborate by triggering adaptive immunity.
Regarding adaptive immunity, although MAC induced similar innate immunity in vivo, EDA-OVA þ MAC activated
stronger T-cell responses, probably due to the targeting effect
of EDA. Moreover, EDA-OVA þ MAC also induced qualitatively better responses, related to antigen avidity and polyfunctional T cells. Concerning avidity of CD8 T cells, which has
been related to the efficacy of antiviral (29, 30) and antitumor
immunity (31, 32), it was found that CD8 T cells primed by
EDA-OVAþMAC strongly recognized OVA(257–264) peptide
at low antigen concentrations. The high IFN-g production
induced by these low antigen concentrations (a situation
similar to that found in poorly immunogenic tumors) probably helps upregulating MHC molecules on tumor cells, and
concomitantly in their recognition by T cells. Indeed, EDAOVAþMAC induced T cells that efficiently recognized B16OVA tumors in vitro, and is probably responsible for its
antitumor efficacy in vivo. In line with this result, it has been
recently published that an adjuvant combination containing
ligands of TLR2/6, TLR3 and TLR9 qualitatively enhanced Tcell responses, by increasing their functional avidity in a viral
protection model (33). Interestingly, that triple combination,
which only shares with EDA þ MAC the TLR3 ligand poly(I:
C), also increased IL-15 and IL-15R expression, a cytokine
which mediates CD8 T-cell avidity maturation (34), suggesting
that induction of this cytokine by adjuvant combinations
might be related to their ability to activate high-avidity T
cells. Finally, activation of polyfunctional CD8 T cells, those
producing several cytokines and displaying different effector
functions, was higher in response to low antigen concentrations after EDA-OVA þ MAC administration. Polyfunctional T

cells produce more cytokine per cell (35, 36) and they are
associated with control of viral infections (37, 38) and tumor
regression (39). Thus, parameters associated with better T-cell
responses such as higher IFN-g production, induction of highavidity T cells which recognize lower antigen levels expressed
by poorly immunogenic tumor cells, or induction of polyfunctional T cells, may explain the higher efficacy of this strategy.
Rechallenge experiments using cured mice have shown that
they are not only completely protected against the same tumor,
but also show partial protection against a tumor lacking the
antigen used in the therapeutic adjuvant combination, suggesting that epitope spreading takes place during therapymediated tumor rejection. Immunity against tumor antigens
not used in immunization (mainly TRP-2) was induced when
administering EDA-OVA þ MAC, making these tumor antigens immunogenic, which in the absence of activating signals,
did not trigger T-cell responses. Thus, this strategy has the
advantage of inducing additional protective immunity against
other unknown tumor antigens not used in the therapy.
In summary, a poorly immunogenic tumor not responding
to therapies based on single or double adjuvant administration can be made to respond using a multiple adjuvant
combination and tumor antigen targeting strategy, associated
with the induction of quantitatively and qualitatively better Tcell responses.
