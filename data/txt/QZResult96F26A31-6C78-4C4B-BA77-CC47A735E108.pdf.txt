Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Immune checkpoint inhibitors1 result in impressive clinical responses2–5 but optimal results will
require combination with each other6 and other therapies. This raises fundamental questions about
mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. Here, we report major tumor regressions in a
subset of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an anti-CTLA4 antibody (anti-CTLA4)
and radiation (RT) and reproduced this effect in mouse models. Although combined treatment
improved responses in irradiated and unirradiated tumors, resistance was common. Unbiased
analyses of mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of PD-L1 on melanoma cells and
associated with T cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response in melanoma and other cancer
types requires RT, anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1/PD-1. Anti-CTLA4 predominantly inhibits T
regulatory cells (Tregs) to increase the CD8 T cell to Treg (CD8/Treg) ratio. RT enhances the
diversity of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of intratumoral T cells. Together, anti-CTLA4
promotes expansion of T cells, while RT shapes the TCR repertoire of the expanded peripheral
clones. Addition of PD-L1 blockade reverses T cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the CD8/
Treg ratio and further encourages oligo-clonal T cell expansion. Similar to results from mice,
patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond to RT + antiCTLA4, demonstrated persistent T cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, PD-L1 on
melanoma cells allows tumors to escape anti-CTLA4-based therapy, and the combination of RT,
anti-CTLA4, and anti-PD-L1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms.

Anecdotal clinical reports suggest that RT may cooperate with anti-CTLA4 to systemically
enhance melanoma response7; however, this combination has not been reported in a clinical
trial. To examine the feasibility and efficacy of RT combined with immune checkpoint
blockade, we initiated a phase I clinical trial of 22 patients with multiple melanoma
metastases (Extended Data Table 1). A single index lesion was irradiated with
hypofractionated RT, delivered over two or three fractions, followed by four cycles of the
anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Accrual was completed in three
out of four RT dose levels, and treatment was well tolerated (Extended Data Table 2).
Evaluation of the unirradiated lesions by CT imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) demonstrated that 18% of patients had a partial response (PR) as
best response, 18% had stable disease (SD), and 64% had progressive disease (PD) (Fig. 1a).
For example, patient PT-402 showed a large reduction in sizes of unirradiated tumors and a
partial metabolic response by positron emission tomography (PET) (Fig. 1b). None of the 12
patients evaluated by PET had progressive metabolic disease in the irradiated lesion

(Extended Data Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 3). The median progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.8 and 10.7 months with median follow-up of 18.4 and
21.3 months (18.0 and 21.3 for patients without event), respectively (Fig. 1c).

Although responses were observed, the majority of patients in our trial did not respond. To
understand the contribution of RT to immune checkpoint blockade and to discover
mechanisms of resistance, we utilized the B16-F10 melanoma mouse model. Mice with
bilateral flank tumors received anti-CTLA4, irradiation of one tumor (index) using a microirradiator, or both treatments delivered concurrently (Fig. 1d). The best responses in both
tumors occurred with RT + anti-CTLA4. RT given before or concurrently with CTLA4
blockade yielded similar results (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Complete responses (CRs) were
CD8 T cell-dependent, and mice with CRs also exhibited CD8 T cell-dependent immunity to
tumor re-challenge (Extended Data Fig. 1d–e). However, similar to our clinical trial, only
approximately 17% of mice responded. To better understand determinants of response, we
derived cell lines from unirradiated tumors that relapsed after RT + anti-CTLA4 (Res 499
and Res 177). Resistance was confirmed in vivo and was not due to intrinsic RT resistance
(Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Random forest (RF) machine learning analysis8,9 of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) demonstrated that the top predictor of resistance, as
measured by variable importance scores and selection, was the CD8+CD44+ to Treg (CD8/
Treg) ratio (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2d). In resistant tumors, the CD8/Treg ratio failed to
increase after RT + anti-CTLA4 as it did in sensitive tumors because CD8+CD44+ T cells
did not significantly expand despite reduction in Tregs (Fig. 1f). Other immune variables
associated with resistance were also related to the failure to accumulate CD8 TILs.

The prevalence of CD8 TILs can be blunted by mechanisms that interfere with T cell
function. Transcriptomic profiling of Res 499/177 tumors revealed that PD-L1 was among
the top 0.2% of upregulated genes that make up a RT + anti-CTLA4 “resistance gene
signature” (Extended Data Fig. 2e, SI Table 1). Other genes include interferon stimulated
genes, which may promote immune suppression through PD-L110,11. Similarly, PD-L1 was
co-expressed with the resistance signature in tumors from a previously reported12 cohort of
metastatic melanoma patients (Fig. 1g). This increase in PD-L1 was observed on melanoma
cells devoid of contaminating stromal cells, and a comparable increase was similarly seen in
the Res 237 murine breast cancer cells (Fig. 1h), which was selected from the TSA line for
resistance to RT + anti-CTLA4 (Extended Data Fig. 2f–g). In contrast, expression of other
inhibitory receptors and their ligands nominated by gene profiling did not suggest an
obvious role in resistance (Extended Data Fig. 2h–i). Indeed, genetic elimination of PD-L1
on Res 499 cells by CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 2j) restored response to RT + anti-CTLA4
by increasing survival from 0% to 60% (Fig. 1i). Thus, an increase in PD-L1 on tumor cells
observed in multiple cancer types can be a dominant resistance mechanism to RT + antiCTLA4.
Elevated levels of PD-L1 can promote T cell exhaustion, a state characterized by
dysfunction in T cell proliferation and effector function13. Exhausted T cells co-express the
PD-L1 receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor Eomes14. Reversal of exhaustion, known
as reinvigoration, is marked by an increase in the proliferation marker Ki67 and the
cytotoxic protein GzmB within the exhausted T cell pool. In both untreated parental and

resistant tumors, approximately 20% of CD8 TILs co-expressed PD-1 and Eomes, and only
a minority of these cells were Ki67+GzmB+, indicating that a significant fraction was
exhausted (Fig. 2a–b). In B16-F10 tumors, RT + anti-CTLA4 markedly increased both the
proportion of PD-1+Eomes+ CD8 T cells and the proportion that were Ki67+GzmB+ within
this subset. In contrast, in resistant tumors the average proportion of PD-1+Eomes+ T cells
that were Ki67+GzmB+ only marginally increased after RT + anti-CTLA4; however,
addition of anti-PD-L1 increased this to levels observed in parental tumors treated with only
RT + anti-CTLA4. The frequency of CD8+CD44+ TILs and the CD8/Treg ratio also
increased (Fig. 2c), and these were strongly correlated with the proportion of PD-1+Eomes+
CD8 TILs that were Ki67+GzmB+ (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Importantly, addition of antiPD-L1 improved responses of resistant Res 499 tumors after RT + anti-CTLA4 (Extended
Data Fig. 3b–c). For treatment naïve tumors, responses were even more dramatic as the
addition of either anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 to RT + anti-CTLA4 markedly improved survival
and increased CRs to 80% (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). On average, 58% of mice
with CRs after adding anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 were alive 90+ days after tumor rechallenge,
and similar improvements were observed with Res 237 breast cancer tumors after addition
of PD-L1 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 3g–i). Thus, elevated PD-L1 on tumor cells results
in persistent T cell exhaustion that impairs the CD8/Treg ratio. Addition of PD-L1 blockade
inhibits resistance and results in long-term immunity.

Notably, RT is needed to achieve high CR rates as dual checkpoint blockade proved inferior
to dual checkpoint blockade plus RT (Fig. 2d), a requirement additionally seen in a
pancreatic cancer model (Extended Data Fig. 3j). The superiority of triple therapy in
multiple cancer types suggests non-redundant mechanisms for each treatment. To examine
this notion, we assessed treatment-related changes in TILs from unirradiated tumors. RF
modeling of immune cell profiles confirmed that anti-CTLA4 predominantly caused a
decrease in Tregs, anti-PD-L1 strongly increased CD8 TIL frequency, and the blockade of
both increased the CD8/Treg ratio (Fig. 3a–b, Extended Data Fig. 4a). In contrast, RT
caused only a modest increase in CD8 TILs; however, TCR sequencing revealed that this
was accompanied by increased diversity of TCR clonotypes, which could be observed even
in the presence of CTLA4 blockade (Fig. 3c–3d). Thus, within the tumor microenvironment,
CTLA4 blockade primarily decreases Tregs, PD-L1 blockade predominantly reinvigorates
exhausted CD8 TILs, and RT diversifies the TCR repertoire of TILs from unirradiated
tumors.

Author Manuscript

To investigate if treatment effects on TILs were propagated to the peripheral T cell pool, we
examined spleen and blood. As observed in TILs, RT + anti-CTLA4 reinvigorated
exhausted PD-1+Eomes+ splenic CD8 T cells, and this reinvigoration was further enhanced
by addition of anti-PD-L1 (Fig. 3e–f). Reinvigoration after addition of anti-PD-L1 was also
accompanied by a large expansion of a small subset of the top 100 most frequent TCR
clonotypes found in TILs (Fig. 3g). Remarkably, some clones reached a frequency in the
post-treatment blood of over 20% after RT and dual checkpoint blockade (Fig. 3h). With
anti-CTLA4 +/− RT, peripheral T cell clonal expansion was modest, which parallels the low
CR rates following this treatment. RT alone was insufficient to drive peripheral T cell
expansion, despite increasing TCR repertoire diversity of TILs, but did promote qualitative
alterations in the TCR repertoire of the most expanded clonotypes. Unsupervised analysis

using the average CDR3 amino acid features15,16 demonstrated that the TCRs of the most
frequent clonotypes in the post-treatment blood formed two readily apparent clusters based
on RT treatment (Fig. 3i). In contrast, the most frequent clonotypes from pre-treatment
blood and randomly sampled clonotypes from post-treatment blood did not separate into
clusters, consistent with differences in CDR3 amino acid properties being an effect of RT
only observed in the most expanded clones (Extended Data Fig. 4b–c). The separation into
two clusters was driven by differences in the CDR3 occupancy profile of short amino acid
sequences belonging to distinct subsets differing in size, polarity, and electrostatic charge
(Extended Data Fig. 4d–e). Together, these observations suggest that the favorable immune
changes in TILs after immune checkpoint blockade promote their peripheral clonal
expansion. When combined with increased TCR repertoire diversity afforded by RT,
selection and oligo-clonal peripheral expansion of clones with distinct TCR traits are
favored.

To determine if treatment and resistance-related changes in peripheral T cells can constitute
a biomarker for tumor response, we modeled the effects of reinvigoration, exhaustion, and
the CD8/Treg ratio. Specifically, we used 1) the percent PD-1+ splenic CD8 T cells that are
Eomes+ to integrate the burden that exhausted T cells might exert, 2) the percent PD-1+ CD8
T cells that are Ki67+GzmB+ as a measure of potential reinvigoration, and 3) the CD8/Treg
ratio as a barometer for the suppressive potential of Tregs. The overall prediction accuracy
of the model was 84%, and variables for T cell reinvigoration and exhaustion were the most
predictive, followed by the CD8/Treg ratio (Extended Data Fig. 5a–b). Moreover, the
percentage of PD-1+ CD8 T cells that were Eomes+ was a striking modifier of the likelihood
of CR as nearly all observed CRs occurred when the percent Ki67+GzmB+ in PD-1+ CD8 T
cells was high but the relative size of the PD-1+Eomes+ exhausted population was not (Fig.
4a). Similar relationships existed with the CD8/Treg ratio, and prediction using T cells from
peripheral blood yielded highly similar results (Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). In total, immune
parameters from peripheral T cells that relate the size of the exhausted T cell population,
reinvigoration, and the CD8/Treg ratio can predict response to RT combined with immune
checkpoint blockade.

In order to assess whether immune predictors discovered in mice could be shared with
patients, we examined peripheral T cells and tumor biopsies from patients on our clinical
trial of RT + anti-CTLA4. For all 10 patients with available pre- and post-treatment blood,
two had PRs in unirradiated tumors and PFS significantly longer than the median. For both
of these patients, the percentages of Ki67+GzmB+ increased in PD-1+Eomes+ CD8 T cells
after treatment while the proportion of PD-1+Eomes+ T cells remained at or below the mean
(Fig. 4b). In contrast, patients with a high percentage of PD-1+Eomes+ T cells posttreatment did not have PRs and had a short PFS, regardless of reinvigoration. Comparison of
patient PT-402, who had extended PFS/PR (Fig. 1a–b), with patient PT-102, who had short
PFS/PD, demonstrates how reinvigoration is associated with response to RT + anti-CTLA4
as it is in mice (Fig. 4c vs. Extended Fig. 5f–g and Fig. 3e–f). Examination of pre-treatment
tumor biopsies from patients PT-402 and PT-102 (Fig. 4d), and from all patients with
available biopsy (Extended Data Table 4), revealed that PD-L1lo intensity on melanoma
cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a) was associated with reinvigoration of PD-1+Eomes+ and of
PD-1+ CD8 T cells after RT + anti-CTLA4, while PD-L1hi status was associated with

persistent exhaustion (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 6b). None of the patients with PD-L1hi on
melanoma cells had a CR/PR, and all rapidly progressed and died (Fig. 4f–g). PD-L1 status
on macrophages was neither associated with reinvigoration nor independently predictive of
PFS (Extended Data Fig. 6c–d). Thus, collective results from patients and mice suggest that
elevated PD-L1 on melanoma cells inhibits T cell function and tumor response to RT + antiCTLA4.

Author Manuscript

We investigated RT + anti-CTLA4 in mice and patients to understand mechanisms of both
response and resistance (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Anti-CTLA4 predominantly inhibits Tregs,
increasing the CD8/Treg ratio as previously described17, and results in modest peripheral
expansion of TCR clonotypes in the tumor, also consistent with other reports18,19. RT
diversifies the TCR repertoire of TILs and shapes the repertoire of expanded clones.
Although the cause and consequence of these repertoire changes remain to be defined, RT
can alter peptide presentation20, and CDR3 changes after M. tuberculosis infection have
been hypothesized to be antigen-driven15. Resistance to RT + anti-CTLA4 can ensue due to
elevated PD-L1 on cancer cells driving T cell exhaustion, a process that can be antagonized
by PD-L1 blockade. However, severely exhausted T cells may regain only limited function
after reinvigoration13,14, explaining why the correlation between reinvigoration and
response declines when the exhausted T cell pool is large. Although tumors with genetic
elimination of PD-L1 in melanoma cells can still relapse, suggesting resistance through
other pathways and/or PD-L1 on non-tumor cells, the upregulation of PD-L1 by cancer cells
is a dominant resistance mechanism in our models. Moreover, the shared findings between
mice and patients predict that addition of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade to RT + anti-CTLA4 may
show significant efficacy in clinical trials.

METHODS
Clinical trial patients and study design

Author Manuscript

The clinical protocol was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01497808). Eligible patients
were at least 18 years of age with previously treated or untreated stage IV melanoma with
multiple metastasis. Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1, adequate renal, hepatic, and hematological function, no current
or history of CNS metastasis, no prior radiation that precludes use of stereotactic body
radiation (SBRT), and at least one tumor between 1–5 cm that could be treated with SBRT.
The primary objectives of this phase I study were to determine feasibility, dose-limiting
toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated SBRT fraction when given in conjunction with
ipilimumab. The secondary objectives were to determine late toxicity, immune-related
clinical responses and changes. The study treated successive cohorts of patients with
escalating doses of SBRT to a single tumor (index lesion), followed 3–5 days later by
ipilimumab every three weeks for four doses. Moderate RT doses were used since higher RT
dose has not been clearly correlated with better immune response but would likely increase
toxicity. Patients were stratified into two stratum based on treatment site (lung or bone vs.
liver or subcutaneous) and dose escalation of SBRT were determined as follows: For lung/
bone lesion, dose level 1 (DL1) was 8 Gy x 2; dose level 2 (DL2) was 8 Gy x 3; and for
liver/subcutaneous lesion, DL1 was 6 Gy x 2; DL2 was 6 Gy x 3. The study followed a

“treat six” design with the goal of accruing 6 patients to each dose level, or 24 patients total.
Enrollment to a dose level would stop if 2 or more patients had a DLT. If 0–1 patients out of
the 6 had a DLT at DL1, escalation to DL2 would proceed. No DLTs were observed,
defined by the protocol as any treatment-related grade 4 or higher immune-related toxicity
(NCI CTC Version 4.0) or grade 3 or higher non-immune related toxicity experienced
during study treatment or within 30 days after the last injection of ipilimumab. Pre- and
post-treatment blood, CT, and PET/CT were obtained to follow tumor response and assess
immune responses. Response evaluation by imaging was performed within 60 days of the
last ipilimumab treatment using either RECIST v1.121 or PERCIST. The study protocol was
approved by the University of Pennsylvania institutional review board. All participating
patients provided written informed consent.
Cell lines and tissue culture

Author Manuscript

B16-F10 was purchased from ATCC. TSA was a gift from Sandra Demaria. PDA.4662 cell
line was derived from single cell suspensions of PDA tissue from LSL-KrasLSL-G12D/+,LSLp53LSL-R172H/+,Pdx1-Cre mice as previously described22. B16-F10 and PDA.4662 cell lines
were cultured at 37° C in DMEM and TSA cells were cultured at 37° C in RPMI. Media was
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 2 mM Lglutamine. All cell lines were determined to be free of Mycoplasma (Lonza) and common
mouse pathogens (IDEXX).
In vivo mouse studies

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Five to seven week old female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from NCI
Production (Frederick, MD) and Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained
under pathogen free conditions. All animal experiments were performed according to
protocols approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Pennsylvania. For B16-F10 melanoma, 5×104 B16-F10 cells were mixed with an equal
volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and subcutaneously injected on the right flank of
C57BL/6 mice on day 0 and the left flank on day 2. The right flank tumor site was irradiated
with 20 Gy on day 8. Blocking antibodies were given on days 5, 8 and 11. For the
concurrent vs. sequential RT experiment, the right flank was irradiated on either day 8
(sequential) or 12 (concurrent), while blocking antibodies were given on days 9, 12, and 15.
For TSA breast cancer, 1×105 TSA cells were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) and subcutaneously injected on the right flank of BALB/c on day 0 and the left
flank on day 2. The right flank of the mice was irradiated with 8 Gy on three consecutive
days starting on day 10 or 11 post tumor implantation. Blocking antibodies were started 3
days prior to RT and given every 3 days for a total of 3 doses. For the pancreatic cancer
model, 4×105 PDA.4662 cells were subcutaneously injected on the right flank. The right
flank was irradiated with 20 Gy on day 8. Blocking antibodies were given on days 5, 8, and
11. For melanoma and breast cancer models, we used the optimal dose and fraction of
radiation as previously reported23,24. All irradiation was performed using the Small Animal
Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). Antibodies used for in vivo immune checkpoint
blockade experiments were given intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 μg/mouse and include:
CTLA4 (9H10), PD-1 (RMP1-14), PDL-1 (10F.9G2), CD8 (2.43), and rat IgG2B isotype
(LTF-2) (BioXCell). Anti-CD8 was given 2 days prior to tumor implantations (day −2), day

0, then every 4 days for the duration of the experiment. Perpendicular tumor diameters were
measured using calipers. Volume was calculated using the formula L × W2 × 0.52, where L
is the longest dimension and W is the perpendicular dimension.
Survival and tumor response analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Differences in survival were determined for each group by the Kaplan-Meier method and the
overall p-value was calculated by the log-rank test using the “survival” R package version
2.37+. For mouse studies, an event was defined as death or when tumor burden reached a
protocol-specified size of 1.5 cm in maximum dimension to minimize morbidity. To help
control for differences in treatment response due to experimental variation or intrinsic
growth differences with sublines, tumor volume measurements were also analyzed after
normalizing to the average volumes of untreated control mice. These average untreated
tumor volumes were determined at day 11–12, a time when tumor dimensions could be
accurately measured, and was considered a baseline tumor volume (Vcont). Normalized
tumor response to treatment is the measured volume (V) relative to Vcont, or V/Vcont, a
dimensionless value that is relative to a baseline volume. Measurements from different
experiments separated by 1–2 days were binned. Differences in growth curves were
determined by a mixed effect linear model with normalized data using the “lmerTest” R
package version 2.0. Sample size estimations were based on preliminary pilot experiments.
For control mice, we expected an average tumor volume of 0.4 cm3 at day 17–21. For most
experiments, we assumed the treatment group would have an effect size resulting in a 50%
reduction in average tumor volume. Sigma was estimated to be 1.5. For a 0.80 power at the
0.05 alpha level, this gave us a sample size of 5 mice. Mice were randomly assigned a
treatment group. For experiments whereby the effect size was expected to be small and/or
non-robust, two independent researchers with at least one researcher blinded to the treatment
group assignments performed caliper measurements.
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

For flow cytometric analysis of in vivo experiments, blood, spleen, and tumor were
harvested at either day 16 or 18 post tumor implantation. Single cell suspensions were
prepared and red blood cells were lysed using ACK Lysis Buffer (Life Technologies). Live/
dead cell discrimination was performed using Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit
(Life Technologies) or Sytox Red Dead Cell Stain (Life Technologies). Cell surface staining
was done for 20–30 minutes. Intracellular staining was done using a fixation/
permeabilization kit (00-5521-00, eBioscience.) T effector cells were phenotyped as
CD8+CD44+, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as CD11b+Gr-1+, and regulatory T
cells (Tregs) as CD4+FOXP3+. All flow cytometric analysis was done using an LSR II (BD)
or FACSCalibur (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar) or the FlowCore
package in the R language and environment for statistical computing. See Supplementary
Methods for a list of antibodies used.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were collected at the time of surgical resection or
from biopsy. All patients with available recent biopsy, which was optional for trial
enrollment, were used for analysis. After heat-induced antigen retrieval (Bond ER2, 20
min.), the tumor slides were stained with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (E1L3N, Cell Signaling) at
1:50 dilution. Intensity of staining on a 0–3+ scale, the percent tumor cells or macrophages
with positive staining, and the cellular pattern (membrane vs. cytoplasm) were analyzed by
two pathologists. Samples with membrane PD-L1 staining intensity score of 0–1 were
classified as PD-L1lo, and samples with an intensity score of 2+ in at least 1% of the cells
were classified as PD-L1hi. To confirm specificity, the anti-PD-L1 antibody was validated
by staining Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells25 and placenta26.
Statistical methods and software

Author Manuscript

Computational analysis and predictions were performed using the R language and
environment for statistical computing (version 3.0+) and Bioconductor (version 2.22+). The
significance of all two-way comparisons was determined by two-sample, two-tailed t-test.
An F-test was used to test for equal variance and a Shapiro-Wilks test was used to test for
normality. For non-parametric data, a Wilcoxon test was used. A mixed effect linear model
was used to determine significance of differences in tumor growth. Simple correlation
between variables was done using a Pearson’s correlation. Unless noted, samples were
independent biological replicates.
Microarray data processing and normalization

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated and purified from cells using Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent (Fisher.)
Total RNA from tumors was isolated and purified from frozen specimens using Isol-RNA
Lysis Reagent and Qiagen RNAeasy extraction kit with DNAase I on column treatment.
Labeled RNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 and 2.0 ST
Array. Affymetrix CEL files for all samples were processed using the RMA method as
implemented in the “oligo” R package version 1.26.6. Probe annotations were provided by
the “mogene10sttranscriptcluster.db” and “mogene20sttranscriptcluster.db” R package
version 8.0.1 and 2.13.0, respectively. Since different array types and different batches were
used, each expression set was z-score transformed27 and median centered. Multiple probes
for the same gene were averaged and only genes common to the 1.0 and 2.0 ST arrays were
kept. Batch effects were adjusted using the ComBat method as implemented in the “sva” R
package version 3.8.0. The microarray data has been deposited at the GEO (GSE65503) and
processed data provided as SI Table 2. Gene expression data for primary melanoma samples
were downloaded from the GEO (GSE22155). For this data set, the post-processed data and
provided annotations were used.

Determining differentially expressed genes and enriched gene sets

Author Manuscript

Non-specific filtering was used to remove genes with an interquartile range less than 0.05.
To find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parental sensitive and resistant
tumors, Significance Analysis of Microarray28 (“samr” R package version 2.0) was applied
using a two class unpaired comparison, minimal fold change of 1.2, and median false
discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. Unannotated transcripts were not considered. To test whether
gene sets were enriched in response to different conditions, we utilized Gene Set Analysis as
implemented in the “GSA” R package version 1.0329. The “maxmean” test statistic was
used to test enrichment using a two-class comparison. All p-values and false discovery rates
were based on 500–1000 permutations. For restandardization, a method that combines
randomization and permutation to correct permutation values of the test statistic and to take
into account the overall distribution of individual test statistics, the entire data set was used
rather than only the genes in the gene sets tested.

Flow cytometry data processing
Gating was performed using either FlowJo version 9.7.5 or the FlowCore R package version
1.28.24. For computational modeling, values were normalized by subtracting the average
values of untreated controls. For the CD8/Treg ratio, the percent CD8+CD44+ cells were
divided by the percent CD4+FOXP3+ cells. Because these data could be skewed with
varying and wide distributions, these data were log transformed for downstream analysis.
Random forest for classification and survival analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Random forest (RF) for classification, regression, and survival analysis is a multivariable
non-parametric ensemble partitioning tree method that can be used to model the effect of all
interactions between genes on a response variable30,31. Each model was constructed using
approximately two-thirds of randomly selected samples and cross-validated on the one-third
of the samples left out of the model building process (out-of-bag samples). After many
iterations, results of all models were averaged to provide unbiased estimates of predicted
values, error rates, and measures of variable importance. Performance of an RF-RC model
was measured by the misclassification error rate for classification, mean squared error for
regression, and by a concordance index (one minus the error rate) for survival. For each
variable, an importance score was determined, which measures the contribution of the
variable to the error rate (higher scores are more predictive). When multiple response
variables were modeled, as in the case of determining which treatment predicts changes in a
set of immune parameters, treatment groups were converted to a design matrix and
importance scores were determined for each response variable. We used the
“randomForestSRCM” R package version 1.2 implementation32 and the following
parameters: 1000 trees, node size of 1, mtry values equal to the number of variables in the
model, and the Breiman-Cutler permutation method for importance score determination9.
Gini index splitting rule was used for classification and a log-rank slitting rule was used for
survival analysis. For classification, stratified sampling was used when the number of
samples in each class was imbalanced. All predicted values, error rates, and importance
scores were calculated using out-of-bag samples to provide unbiased estimates. To account
for variance due to sample size and sampling error on the accuracy of these performance

measures, bootstrapping was performed using 1000–5000 bootstrap iterations and the mean
and standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution were determined. For presentation
purposes, cut-off values for predictive variables were determined by using partial plots to
estimate inflection points.

Author Manuscript

Minimal depth was used as a rigorous method to select predictive variables. Minimal depth
(MD) is a dimensionless statistic that we have recently described8 that measures the
predictiveness of a variable in tree-based models. Specifically, MD measures the shortest
distance from the root node of a classification/regression tree to the parent node of a
maximal subtree for a variable. The maximal subtree for a variable is the largest subtree
whose root node splits on the variable. Thus, smaller values for MD indicate better
predictiveness. A threshold value for MD that is calculated from the tree-averaged value
determines whether a variable is strongly predictive. The entire MD-based variable selection
is performed using two-third of the samples (in-bag samples). An unbiased prediction error
rate for a model refit with the MD-selected variables is calculated using only out-of-bag
samples. Using the “randomForestSRCM” package, we applied this MD-based variable
selection with the same parameters used for RF as noted above. The tree-averaged MD
threshold was used. Data were bootstrapped to provide robust estimates of MD values and
prediction error rates. The frequency of bootstrap models whereby the MD values for a
variable was less than the MD threshold determined how often a variable was selected as a
top variable, which provides an estimate for the stability of variable selection.
TCR deep sequencing and clonotype diversity analysis

Author Manuscript

DNA from pre-treatment blood, post-treatment blood, and tumor was extracted on day 16
using the Qiagen DNA extraction protocol. Samples were sequenced by Adaptive
Biotechnologies using “survey” sequencing depth for tumor and “deep” sequencing depth
for blood samples. Processed data were downloaded and frequencies/counts for TCR
clonotypes were examined by nucleotide sequences after non-productive reads were filtered
out. The top 100 most frequent TCR clonotypes in the tumor were used to examine their
frequencies in the pre- and post-treatment blood. The Shannon’s diversity index33 (DI)
normalized to the number of reads (DI = −Σ (pi ln pi)/ln n, where n is the number of clones,
pi is the clonal frequency of the ith clone, and sigma is summed from i=1 to i=n) was
calculated for each sample. This gives a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is monoclonal and 1
is an even distribution of different clones.
Unsupervised and supervised analysis of CDR3 amino acid properties

Author Manuscript

Based on previously described methods15,16, Atchley factors were used to reduce a linear
sequence of amino acids into analyzable numeric features of distinct amino acid properties.
The five Atchley factors and the attributes they measure are: 1) PAH: accessibility, polarity,
and hydrophobicity, 2) PSS: propensity for secondary structure, 3) MS: molecular size, 4)
CC: codon composition, 5) EC: electrostatic charge. Each CDR3 was represented as a set of
all possible contiguous amino acids of length p (p-tuple). We chose p=3 based on previous
published reports but examined a range of p values, which gave comparable results (see
below). For each p-tuple, the Atchley factors for the amino acids were then calculated to
give a vector of length 5p, or 15 (3 amino acids x 5 Atchley factors). Thus, each CDR3 was

represented by a set of these vectors. The average values for these vectors were calculated
for the top B most frequent clones from the post-treatment blood. A cut-off of B=5 was
chosen based on examination of the frequency distribution of the TCR clonotypes and an
estimate of the number of clones with extreme values compared to the rest of the
distribution. These averaged values were then clustered into two groups by k-means
clustering with k=2. The association between cluster membership and treatment with or
without RT was calculated by Fisher’s exact test. This entire process was repeated for the
five clones in the pre-treatment blood, for randomly drawn clones from the post-treatment
blood, for p-tuple lengths from p=2 to 10, and for cut-off values from B=3 to 50. In all cases,
the distribution of p-values was compared to the p-value from the observed data.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Although averaging the Atchley factor values is a simple method to agglomerate CDR3
features for unsupervised classification, it does not provide insight into how treatment
groups influence the amino acids that comprise the CDR3. To understand which sets of ptuples were most strongly influenced by treatment groups with RT, without RT, and pretreatment blood, we used previously described methods15 to assign p-tuples into n clusters
based on their Atchley factor vector. Model based clustering with cluster number
determination using the “mclust” R package was applied to all p-tuples from the top five
clones in all treatment groups from pre- and post-treatment blood. This gave rise to 17
clusters, or subsets, of p-tuples. The proportion of p-tuples belonging to each of these 17
subsets, denoted Pi, was then calculated for each clonotype and used as features. The subsets
that were most influenced by treatment group (treatment group with RT, without RT, or pretreatment) were then analyzed by multivariable RF regression using a design matrix for
treatment groups as the x-variable and Pi as the response variable. The variables Pi most
affected by each treatment group were selected by comparing the observed importance
scores to the importance scores generated by permutation. To determine the location and
frequencies of amino acids belonging to the selected p-tuple subsets across the variable
length CDR3 region, the CDR3 of each clone was divided into 10 bins of equal size. Then,
the proportion of p-tuples in each of these 10 bins belonging to the selected subset was
calculated and compared between treatment groups.

Melanoma biopsy sites and PD-L1(hi) status of melanoma cells from patients on clinical
trial.
Recent biopsy was optional for enrollment on the clinical trial. Tumor tissue from all
patients with recent biopsy was used. PD-L1 status was determined by examination of
membrane staining on melanoma cells. PD-L1(hi) was classified as 2+ on at least 1% of
cells. Patient ID 3 is patient PT-102, and patient ID 4 is patient PT-402.
