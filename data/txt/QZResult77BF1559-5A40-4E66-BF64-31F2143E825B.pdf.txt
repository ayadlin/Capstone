ABSTRACT
The proto-oncogene c-Myc plays substantial role in multiple myeloma (MM)
pathogenesis and is considered a potential drug target. Here we provide evidence of a
novel mechanism for PRIMA-1Met, a small molecule with anti-tumor activity in phase I/
II clinical trial, showing that PRIMA-1Met induces apoptosis in MM cells by suppressing
c-Myc and upregulating miRNA-29a. Our study further demonstrates that miRNA-29a
functions as a tumor suppressor which targets c-Myc. The baseline expression of
miR-29a was significantly lower in MM cell lines and MM patient samples compared to
normal hematopoietic cells. In addition, ectopic expression of miRNA-29a or exposure
to PRIMA-1Met reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in MM cells. On the
other hand, overexpression of c-Myc at least partially reverted the inhibitory effects
of PRIMA-1Met or miRNA-29a overexpression suggesting the miRNA-29a/c-Myc axis
mediates anti-myeloma effects of PRIMA-1Met. Importantly, intratumor delivery of
miRNA-29a mimics induced regression of tumors in mouse xenograft model of MM
and this effect synergized with PRIMA-1Met. Our study indicates that miRNA-29a is a
tumor suppressor that plays an important role during PRIMA-1Met-induced apoptotic
signaling by targeting c-Myc and provides the basis for novel therapeutic strategies
using miRNA-29a mimics combined with PRIMA-1Met in MM.

1Met, can display a potent anti-myeloma activity without
requiring functional activation of p53, which is associated
with activation of p63/73 signaling pathway and downregulation of c-Myc [9]. However; PRIMA-1Met may
function through multiple mechanisms, as Tessoulin et al.
recently showed that PRIMA-1Met could trigger cell death
in MM cells by depleting the glutathione (GSH) content
and inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [10].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short
noncoding and highly conserved RNAs, approximately
22 bp in size [11]. miRNAs regulate gene expression both
at transcriptional and translational levels and act in a wide
variety of physiological and biological processes, such
as cell proliferation, differentiation, and hematopoiesis
[12]. Emerging evidence shows that miRNAs play a
critical role in tumor pathogenesis by functioning either

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell
malignancy characterized by the aberrant expansion of
plasma cells within the bone marrow [1]. Despite recent
advances in the introduction of the new drugs including
proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), MM is still an
incurable disease for its resistance to current therapies [13]. Therefore, development of novel treatment options is
urgently required for the treatment of MM patients.
PRIMA-1 is a low-molecular weight compound
that can restore wild-type conformation and specific
DNA binding of mutant p53, consequently triggering
apoptosis in tumour cells carrying mutant p53 [4-8]. We
have recently demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo
studies that the more effective methylated form, PRIMAwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

others have shown that certain miRNAs are deregulated
in primary MM or established MM cell lines and play key
roles in regulatory networks controlling proliferation and/
or survival [14, 15]. However, very little is known about
miRNAs involvement in response to small molecule antitumor agents, particularly PRIMA-1Met/APR246, that has
been tested in first-in-human clinical trial in refractory
hematological malignancies and prostate cancer [16]. Here
we present evidence that miRNA-29a mediates PRIMA1Met-induced cell death in MM by targeting c-Myc and
that lipid-based delivery of miRNA-29a mimics displays
substantial anti-myeloma activity in MM xenograft model,
which synergizes with PRIMA-1Met.

dexamethasone, and doxorubicin) on the expression of
these miRNAs. In contrast to PRIMA-1Met, none of these
agents triggered induction of miRNA-29a (Figure 1E)
suggesting that increased expression of the miRNA-29a
was specific to PRIMA-1Met.

miRNA-29a regulates cell viability and apoptosis
in MM cells
To determine the functional role of miRNA-29a, we
overexpressed miRNA-29a in MM cells and investigated
its growth inhibiting activity. To this end, we transfected
MM.1S and 8226 cells, that constitutively express
relatively low level of this miRNA, with pre-miRNA29a or miRNA-NC. Successful transfection is indicated
by significant increase of miRNA-29a expression in
miRNA-29a-transfected cells (Figure 2A). Moreover,
ectopic expression of miRNA-29a triggered significant
inhibition of cell viability (Figure 2B) and increased
apoptosis (Figure 2C) in both cells. To investigate the role
of miRNA-29a in response to PRIMA-1Met, we examined
the effect of PRIMA-1Met in MM cells overexpressing
miRNA-29a. To this aim, MM.1S cells were transfected
with pre-miRNA-29a or miRNA-NC and then treated
with PRIMA-1Met (10 μM) or DMSO for 48 h. Viability
of the transfected cells was determined as explained
above. Treatment of miRNA-29a-transfected MM cells
with PRIMA-1Met resulted in significant inhibition of cell
viability compared with the cells treated with PRIMA1Met alone (Figure 2D). Using the Chou-Talalay method
as described previously [17], we found the combinatory
effect of miRNA-29a and PRIMA-1Met was synergistic
(CI= 0.92). To further examine if the miRNA-29a regulate
the cytotoxic response of MM cells to PRIMA-1Met, we
transiently transfected MM.1S cell lines with synthetic
inhibitor of AMO-29a. The transfected MM cells were
treated with 10 μM PRIMA-1Met for 48h. Viability was
measured as described above. Inhibition of miRNA-29a
expression reversed the growth inhibitory activity of
PRIMA-1Met (Figure 2E) suggesting an important role of
miRNA-29a in sensitizing MM cells to PRIMA-1Met.

RESULTS
PRIMA-1Met induces differential expression of
tumor suppressor miRNAs in MM cells
The role of miRNAs in mediating small molecule
and drug response is not well described. Therefore, we
sought to determine whether PRIMA-1Met might alter the
expression of miRNAs that were functionally important.
For this purpose, the expression of 84 miRNAs targeting
both cancer and apoptosis pathways was assessed in two
MM cell lines, 8226 and MM.1S, by using miScript miRNA
PCR array (Qiagen). Treatment of 8226 and MM.1S cell
lines with PRIMA-1Met (20 and 10 μM, respectively) for
8h modulated the expression of a significant number of
miRNAs most of which were found to be up-regulated.
miRNA-29a/b and miRNA-34a were among the upregulated miRNAs in response to PRIMA-1Met treatment
(Figure 1A). To further validate the miRNA array data, we
examined the expression of these three selected miRNAs in
above two cell lines after exposure to PRIMA-1Met using the
miScript PCR system with specific miScript primer assays
for miRNA-29a/b and miRNA-34a. qPCR re-analysis
confirmed PRIMA-1Met-induced expression of above
miRNAs in MM.1S and 8226 cells (Figure 1B and C).

hematopoietic cells, MM cell lines and MM
patient samples

PRIMA-1Met down-regulates transcriptional and
translational expression of c-Myc in MM cells

Next, we examined the basal level expression of
miRNA-29a in CD138+ MM patient samples and MM cell
lines and compared those with normal hematopoietic cells.
qPCR analysis revealed that the expression level of these
miRNAs was significantly lower in MM cell lines and
patient samples compared with normal hematopoietic cells
(Figure 1D). These results suggest that low expression
of these miRNAs may play a role in progression of the
disease. In addition, to examine whether up-regulation
of miRNA-29a is specific to PRIMA-1Met, we evaluated
the effect of other anti-myeloma agents (MIRA-1,

In light of the fact that c-Myc is a critical player
in MM oncogenesis [18] and, more importantly, has been
shown to suppress miRNA-29 family members through
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms [19, 20], we sought
to explore whether PRIMA-1Met could also affect c-Myc
expression. Both qPCR and Western blot analysis showed
that PRIMA-1Met treatment decreased c-Myc expression in
MM.1S and 8226 cells (Figure 3A-B). Opposite changes
in expression level between miRNA-29a and c-Myc was
also observed in 3 different primary MM samples in
response to 20 μM PRIMA-1Met (Figure 3C). In addition,

c-Myc as a target for miRNA-29a

time-course experiments were performed for the effect of
10 μM PRIMA-1Met on miRNA-29a and c-Myc protein in
MM.1S cell line. miRNA-29a was increased but c-Myc
protein decreased in a time-dependent manner. However,
non-specific toxic effects of PRIMA-1Met were observed
beyond 8h (as indicated by reduced actin band) (Figure
3D, E). These findings imply that PRIMA-1Met-induced
downregulation of c-Myc and upregulation of miRNA29a might be inversely related. Additionally, transfection
of AMO-29a in MM.1S cells antagonized downregulation
of c-Myc at gene and protein levels upon PRIMA-1Met
treatment further supporting that PRIMA-1Met downregulates c-Myc through interaction with miRNA-29a
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Having shown that PRIMA-1Met alters c-Myc and
miRNA-29a expression in opposite manners, we next
tried to understand whether c-Myc could be a target for
miRNA-29a. Bioinformatics analysis using MiRanda
indicated that the Myc 3’-UTR harbors one target
for miRNA-29a (12-14). This site is at least partially
complementary to a heptamer motif that is found in the
seed region of the miRNA-29a (Figure 3F). To validate
c-Myc as a direct target of miRNA-29a, we cloned the
3’ UTR sequence of human c-Myc into the luciferaseexpressing vector pEZX-MT01 to the downstream of the
luciferase stop codon. miRNA-29a significantly reduced

luciferase activity compared with the scrambled control
miRNA in MM.1S or 8226 MM cells and 293T cells
(Figure 3G) indicating that miRNA-29a binds to the
3’UTR of c-Myc and impairs its mRNA translation. On
the other hand, luciferase activity of the mutant 3’UTR
clone of c-Myc did not show any change in the presence
of miRNA-29a further confirming c-Myc as a direct target
of this miRNA (Figure 3H).

control and cells were analyzed for analysis of miRNA29a, c-Myc and cell viability. Over-expression of c-Myc
in MM.1S and 8226 cells was first verified by Western
blotting (Figure 4A) and then relative expression of
miRNA-29a and c-Myc in MM.1S cells was measured
by qPCR assay (Figure 4B, C). Inhibition of viability
induced by overexpression of miRNA-29a or PRIMA1Met treatment was prevented following overexpression of
c-Myc in both MM.1S and 8226 cells (Figure 4D). These
results indicate that over expression of c-Myc reverts the
effect of miRNA-29a in MM cells. To further evaluate
the impact of c-Myc in PRIMA-1Met-mediated cell death,
we silenced c-Myc gene in MM.1S cells followed by
measurement of miRNA-29a level and cell viability in the
presence or absence of PRIMA-1Met. Silencing of c-Myc
significantly induced cell death and further enhanced the
cytotoxic effects of PRIMA-1Met (Figure 5A, B).

combination of miRNA-29a and PRIMA-1Met

(Figure 6B) in mice compared to the mice treated with
either PRIMA-1Met or miRNA-29a mimics or vehicle.
No significant changes in the body weight of the mice
in these groups was observed indicating that doses of
the miRNA-29a mimics or PRIMA-1Met were tolerable
(Figure 6C). The high expression of miRNA-29a and
low expression of c-Myc observed by qPCR in tumor
samples of the miRNA-29a-treated mice (Figure 6D-E)
validate successful delivery of miRNA-29a mimics. The
expression of Ki-67 and c-Myc decreased and that of
TUNEL increased in tumor samples from miRNA-29amice compared to samples obtained from the vehicletreated mice (Figure 6F).

To further study the potential therapeutic
applicability of our findings as a novel anti-MM treatment,
we examined the effect of miRNA-29a in combination
with PRIMA-1Met in MM xenograft model. When tumors
became measurable, mice were assigned into 4 groups
(5 mice/group). One group of mice was injected with
PRIMA-1Met at 50 mg/kg given intraperitoneally (i.p.).
miRNA was delivered at a lower concentration (10μg) by
lipid-based methods as explained above. Another group
was treated with combination of PRIMA-1Met and miRNA29a mimics. Control group was treated with non-targeting
miRNA and PBS. Treatments were performed once daily
for 14 days. Tumor growth, body weight, and survival of
the mice were monitored. Co-treatment of PRIMA-1Met
and miRNA-29a mimics resulted in significant inhibition
of tumor growth (Figure 6A) and prolongation of survival

other tumors [4-8]. In MM, some reports including
our previous work have disclosed to some level the
mechanisms underlying PRIMA-1Met-induced cell death
[9]. However, regarding the potential roles oncomiRNAs
and tumor suppressor miRNAs play in MM pathogenesis
[21], it’s not known whether PRIMA-1Met imposes its
anti-myeloma activities through miRNAs. Our study
revealed significant lower expression of miRNA-29a
in MM cell lines and patient primary cells compared
to normal hematopoietic cells, enforced expression of
miRNA-29a inhibited viability and triggered apoptosis
in MM cells in vitro. miRNA-29a was upregulated in
MM cells following PRIMA-1Met treatment leading us to
further explore the role of miRNA-29a as a possible tumor
suppressor in PRIMA-1Met-induced effects.
It is well established that miRNA-oncogene/tumor
suppressor axis plays substantial role in drug response,
growth and proliferation of cancer cells [22], however;
whether such an axis operates to mediate the PRIMA1Met-induced effects is unknown. Interestingly, our study
revealed that miRNA-29a mediated PRIMA-1Met-induced

cell death in MM cells by targeting c-Myc, a mechanistic
concept that has not been explored for PRIMA-1Met in MM
before. We showed that PRIMA-1Met treatment of MM
cell lines and MM primary cells upregulated miRNA29a and downregulated c-Myc. PRIMA-1Met increased
miRNA-29a-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells, whereas
miRNA-29a inhibition by its synthetic inhibitor attenuated
PRIMA-1Met-induced inhibition of viability suggesting
that miRNA-29a mediates anti-myeloma activity of
PRIMA-1Met. Further, inhibition of cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis by PRIMA-1Met at concentrations
tolerable in MM [9, 10, 16], were associated with downregulation of c-Myc and up-regulation of miRNA-29a.
Our in vitro observations yield evidence that miRNA29a-Myc axis could function, at least partly, as a novel
mechanism to regulate anti-myeloma activity of PRIMA1Met. In line with our findings, a recent report indicates that
some miRNAs may be involved in MM cells’ response
to bortezomib, however; potential oncogenes or tumor
suppressors linked to these miRNAs requires continuous
exploration [23].

Figure 6: Lipid based delivery of synthetic miRNA-29 mimics retarded tumor growth and prolonged survival in
human MM xenograft models. 8226 (5 × 106) cells were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice (5mice/group). Administration

was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis from the first day of tumor cells injection until death or occurrence of

the experiment described in this panel were analyzed by qPCR for miRNA-29a (D) and c-Myc (E) expression. F. Immunohistochemical
analysis of tumor sections showed that treatment of mice bearing tumors of 8226 with miRNA-29a overexpression resulted in decrease in
the proliferation index (Ki-67), c-Myc and increase in the apoptotic index (TUNEL), further verifying the targeting of c-Myc by miRNA29a to induce apoptosis in MM cells in vivo.

In our study, c-Myc was downregulated by miRNA29a enforced expression or PRIMA-1Met treatment. On
the contrary, in the presence of miRNA-29a inhibitor
c-Myc transcript or protein did not change and PRIMA1Met-induced suppression of c-Myc was at least partially
reversed. Additionally, overexpression of c-Myc reduced
miRNA-29a level and antagonized PRIMA-1Met–induced
MM cell death. This is consistent with the report that
c-Myc is part of a multi-component regulatory complex
which trans-repress several miRNAs including miRNA29a [24]. Our findings suggest that miRNA-29a-Myc axis
mediates the effects of PRIMA-1Met in MM cells through
a feedback loop mechanism (Figure 7). However; we
did not observe any significant change at miRNA-29a
level following c-Myc silencing (data not shown). It is
possible that other factors in the repressor complex might

have compensated, or knockdown of other components
in addition to c-Myc in the regulatory complex might
be needed, more extensive experiments are required to
address this issue. Since c-Myc plays a critical role in MM
pathogenesis as a strong promoter of MM cell growth and
survival [25], we found that knocking down of c-Myc
reduced MM cell viability and sensitized them to PRIMA1Met–induced toxicity.
Several studies demonstrate a mutual functional link
between c-Myc and some Bcl-2 family-related proteins
including Mcl-1 [26-28]. For instance, GP Gregory et
al. showed that dinaciclib (CDK9 inhibitor) suppressed
both c-Myc and Mcl-1 and inhibited progression of
c-Myc-driven lymphoma in mice xenograft models
[28]. We previously showed that PRIMA-1Met could
induce cell death in MM cells by suppressing Mcl-1

Figure 7: Scheme of proposed mechanism for regulation of c-Myc by miRNA on PRIMA-1Met treatment. miRNA-29a-

mediated targeting of c-Myc by PRIMA-1Met may occur as a direct inhibitory effect of the miRNAs. Alternatively, such inhibition can be
seen as an indirect effect of the miRNAs which may be mediated by other targets including Mcl-1 or Bcl-2.

but the mediator (s) of this effect was not defined [9].
In the present study, PRIMA-1Met downregulated Mcl-1
transcript and protein (Figure 4A, supplementary figure
1), and interestingly this effect was partially reversed by
AMO-29a in MM.1S cells suggesting that PRIMA-1Met
may also trigger MM cell death through miRNA-29a
targeting Mcl-1. Indeed miRNA-29a/b have previously
been shown to be associated with targets involved in
regulation of apoptosis such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 that are
often deregulated in malignant cells [29-32]. Of note,
apoptosis-inducing effects of miRNA-29b have been
demonstrated in MM cells by several studies indicating the
potential of miRNA-29 family members mostly as tumor
suppressors in MM [30, 33]. Furthermore, since PRIMA1Met suppressed both Mcl-1 and c-Myc leading to apoptosis
in MM cells in our system (Figure 7), it is speculated that
the two proteins could also interact in response to PRIMA1Met building a network with miRNA-29a to control
PRIMA-1Met-induced cell death in MM. It is conceivable
that suppression of c-Myc (following enforced expression
of miRNA-29a or PRIMA-1Met treatment) may induce
apoptosis of MM cells directly or through inhibition
of Mcl-1.
Finally, our study shows that injection of miRNA29a synthetic mimics inhibits tumor growth and prolongs
survival in subcutaneous mouse xenograft model and
this effect is enhanced in combination with PRIMA1Met indicating that our in vitro observations can be
successfully translated in vivo. Our data are in agreement
with reports by Trang and colleagues [34] and Di Martino
et al. [35] on the safe use of formulated NLE-miRNAs
in experimental animals, and strongly support clinical
development of miRNA-29a-based therapeutic strategies
in MM patients. Notably, formulated miRNA mimics are
distinct from molecularly targeting drugs whose antitumor
activity relies on the modulation of a wide range of genes
rather than inhibition of individual gene products [34-36].

Total RNA or miRNA was extracted using RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) or miRNA Easy kit (Qiagen). RNA quantity
was determined with a spectrophotometer (ND-1000;
Nano-Drop Technologies). cDNAs were synthesized
using miScript II RT kit (QIAGEN) and applied to
Cancer Pathway Finder or Apoptosis miRNA array
plates (SABiosciences) for miRNA measurement using
miScript SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN) in an ABI7900HT machine following manufacturer’s instructions.
The expression of mature miRNAs was calculated relative
to SNORD72. The data were analyzed by RT2 Profiler
PCR Array Data Analysis v3.5, and fold-changes in
miRNA treatments relative to scrambled treatments were
calculated by using the 2-ΔΔCt algorithm.

Overexpression of miRNA-29a, c-Myc and
inhibition of miRNA-29a in MM cells
MM.1S or 8226 cells were transiently transfected
with either pre-miRNA-29a, c-Myc expression plasmid or
scrambled miRNA (Gene Copoeia) using the HiPerFect
transfection reagent (Qiagen). The transfected cells were
then treated with PRIMA-1Met or DMSO and examined
for cell viability using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Biobasic)
or apoptosis assays 48h after transfection. In other
experiments, the above cell lines were transfected
with synthetic miRNA-29 inhibitor (AMO-29a) using
HiPerFect reagent and treated with PRIMA-1Met.

Apoptosis assays
An Annexin V–FITC/propidium iodide apoptosis
detection kit (BD Biosciences) was used to quantify
apoptosis in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and data were analyzed using CellQuest
software (BD Biosciences).

units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2mM
L-glutamine. NCI-H929, U266, and MM.1S cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). CD138+ cells were freshly isolated and purified
from MM patients as described previously [9]. PBMCs and
bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) were collected
from healthy donors and maintained in the culture medium
as described previously [9]. This study was approved
by the research ethics committee of University Health
Network, Toronto, Canada, in accordance with declaration
of Helsinki.

MM.1S cell line was transfected with 15 picomole of c-Myc siRNA (Ambion Silencer Select, Life
Technologies) using Lipofecatmine RNAiMAX.
Knocking-down of the protein was confirmed with
Western blotting. Additionally, 24h after transfection cells
were treated with 10μM PRIMA-1Met and incubated for
additional 24 h. Viability of cells was determined using
MTT assay as described above.

Protein extraction and western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed in cold cell lysis buffer (50mM

sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete mini, Roche). Equal
amounts of proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were
blocked by incubation in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST
(0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) and probed with anti-Myc, antiMcl-1 and anti-GAPDH (Signalway Antibody, Baltimore,
MD, USA). Blots were then developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Millipore).

Statistical analysis
Each experiment was performed at least 3 times
and all values are reported as means ±SD. Comparisons
between groups were made with student’s t-test, while
statistical significance of differences among multiple
groups was determined by GraphPad Prism software.
p value of less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically
significant.

Reporter assay
pEZX-reporter plasmids for the miRNA-29a
putative target c-Myc were constructed. 293T cells,
MM.1S or 8226 cells were transiently cotransfected with
reporter plasmids (pEZX-MT-Control, or pEZX-3’-UTR/
c-Myc), miRNA-29a or control miRNA using HiPerFect
transfection reagent. Cells were harvested 48 h after
transfection and lysed, then firefly and Renilla luciferase
activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System following manufacture’s
instruction. Luciferase activities were analyzed as the
activity of firefly relative to Renilla.

CONCLUSION/CLINICAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
Our investigation provides evidence on miRNA29a involvement in PRIMA-1Met-induced inhibition of
cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MM cells,
and supports the development of miRNA-29a mimics
as potential pharmacological intervention strategy in
MM. The important interaction with c-Myc opens new
opportunities for combinatory therapeutical approaches
which may result in a selective and highly efficient
targeting of pathways crucially involved in the control of
MM cell growth and survival.

In vivo models of human MM
Severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice (6
to 8 weeks old; OCI) were housed and monitored in our
Animal Research Facility. All experimental procedures
and protocols had been approved by the Institutional
Ethical Committee (University Health Network, Toronto).
To establish subcutaneous human MM xenograft
models, 5 × 106/100μl PBS of 8226 cells were mixed
in 100μl Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) and injected
subcutaneously into the right flank of SCID mice (n = 5,
5 mice/group). The mice started developing subcutaneous
tumors approximately 25 days after injection. Tumor size
was monitored and measured every 3 days in 2 dimensions
using calipers, and tumor volume was calculated using the
following formula: V = 0.5a×b2, where “a” and “b” are
the long and short diameters of the tumor, respectively.
Survival was evaluated from the first day of tumor
injection until death. In accordance with institutional
guidelines, mice were sacrificed when their tumors
reached 1.5 cm in diameter or in the event of paralysis
or major compromise in their quality of life, to prevent
unexpected suffering.
