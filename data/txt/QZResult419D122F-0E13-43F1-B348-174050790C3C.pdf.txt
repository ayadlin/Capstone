Abstract

Author Manuscript

Atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 (ACKR3) functions as a scavenger receptor for chemokine
CXCL12, a molecule that promotes multiple steps in tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer
and multiple other malignancies. While normal vascular endothelium expresses low levels of
CXCR7, marked upregulation of CXCR7 occurs in tumor vasculature in breast cancer and other
tumors. To investigate effects of endothelial CXCR7 in breast cancer, we conditionally deleted this
receptor from vascular endothelium of adult mice, generating CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND animals.
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice appeared phenotypically normal, although these animals exhibited a
modest 35 ± 3% increase in plasma CXCL12 as compared with control. Using two different
syngeneic, orthotopic tumor implant models of breast cancer, we discovered that
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had significantly greater local recurrence of cancer following resection,
elevated numbers of circulating tumor cells, and more spontaneous metastases. CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND
mice also showed greater experimental metastases following intracardiac injection of cancer cells.
These results establish that endothelial CXCR7 limits breast cancer metastasis at multiple steps in
the metastatic cascade, advancing understanding of CXCL12 pathways in tumor environments and
informing ongoing drug development targeting CXCR7 in cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Chemokines, a family of peptides that regulate physiologic trafficking of cells, have emerged
as key regulators of metastasis (1, 2). Compared with normal tissue, malignant and/or
stromal cells upregulate multiple chemokines in primary and metastatic tumors. Chemokine
CXCL12 is one of the most prominent regulators of tumor growth and metastasis in breast
cancer and greater than 20 other human cancers (3). CXCL12 secreted by carcinomaassociated fibroblasts in primary breast cancers increases proliferation and invasion of
malignant cells and recruits endothelial progenitor cells for tumor angiogenesis (4). These
processes collectively contribute to vascular intravasation of cancer cells. CXCL12 in
primary breast cancers selects for malignant cells that can home, survive, and proliferate in
CXCL12-rich metastatic sites such as bone marrow, lung, and brain (5, 6). CXCL12 also
confers drug resistance in multiple cancers, limiting eradication of cancer cells and further
reducing survival (3, 7, 8).

Author Manuscript

CXCL12 binds to chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 (recently designated ACKR3),
both of which promote progression of cancer to metastatic disease. While CXCR4 typically
correlates with greater metastases and reduced survival in cancers including breast, lung, and
prostate, outcomes associated with CXCR7 have been less consistently associated with poor
prognosis (9–11). Expression of CXCR7 in cancer cells promotes tumor growth and
metastasis in mouse models of breast and prostate cancer (12, 13). In patients, increased
levels of CXCR7 correlate with worse survival in malignancies of the gallbladder and kidney
(14, 15). However, CXCR7 did not affect outcomes in a study of patients with esophageal
cancer, and CXCR7 corresponded with better survival in neuroblastoma and rectal cancer
(16–18). These discrepancies among effects of CXCR7 on survival suggest contextdependent effects of this receptor on cancer progression, including specific types of cells
that express CXCR7.

Author Manuscript

In addition to malignant cells, CXCR7 is expressed on vascular endothelium under normal
and pathologic conditions. CXCR7 critically regulates development of the cardiovascular
system in two different animal models. Knocking down CXCR7 in zebrafish embryos
prevents formation of intersegmental blood vessels, and mice lacking CXCR7 in all tissues
frequently suffer early post-natal mortality due to myocardial degeneration and/or heart
valve defects (12) (19, 20). CXCR7 is expressed highly in vasculature of human cancers,
including breast, glioma, and renal (12, 21, 22). However, effects of tumor endothelial
CXCR7 on tumor progression remain unknown.
We investigated effects of CXCR7 on tumor vasculature in breast cancer, a disease in which
this receptor is expressed highly on vascular endothelium in mouse models and primary
human breast tumors (12). Adult mice lacking endothelial CXCR7 appear phenotypically
normal, although they have elevated levels of plasma CXCL12. Using two different
syngeneic breast cancer cell lines, we discovered that mice lacking CXCR7 on vascular

endothelium have greater spontaneous metastases from orthotopic tumor implants and
experimentally-induced breast cancer metastases. Collectively, these results reveal that
CXCR7 on vascular endothelium suppresses progression of breast cancer to metastatic
disease.

Results
Deletion of endothelial CXCR7 elevates systemic levels of CXCL12

Author Manuscript

Since embryonic deletion of CXCR7 from vascular endothelium may cause early post-natal
death, we deleted CXCR7 conditionally from endothelium of adult mice using the 5′
endothelial enhancer element from the stem cell leukemia (Scl) locus to drive tamoxifeninducible Cre (CreERT). A previous study established this transgene drives expression of
CreERT selectively in vascular endothelium (23). Treatment with tamoxifen deleted CXCR7
as determined by PCR of tail samples, a well-vascularized tissue used previously to screen
for Cre-mediated excision of genes from vascular endothelium (24, 25) (Fig S1A). These
mice also had reduced expression of CXCR7 on endothelium of the liver, an organ with low
level expression of this receptor on blood vessels sinusoidal under basal conditions (26) (Fig
S1B). We used this tamoxifen protocol to delete CXCR7 from vascular endothelium prior to
all tumor studies, generating CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice. Adult CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice
appeared phenotypically normal.

Author Manuscript

CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor for CXCL12, removing this chemokine from the
extracellular space and degrading it (27, 28). Deleting endothelial CXCR7 significantly
elevated basal levels of CXCL12 in plasma (p < 0.05) (Fig S2). We could not assess effects
of CXCR7 on plasma levels of its second chemokine ligand, CXCL11, because a genetic
mutation eliminates expression of this gene in C57BL/6 mice (19). Overall, these data show
that while endothelial CXCR7 is not essential for survival of adult animals, this receptor
does regulate circulating levels of CXCL12.
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice have greater spontaneous metastases from orthotopic breast
tumors

Author Manuscript

We previously identified CXCR7 on tumor blood vessels in mouse xenograft models of
breast cancer and primary human breast tumors, while this receptor was absent from
vasculature in normal breast tissue (12). To investigate effects of endothelial CXCR7 on
growth and metastasis in breast cancer, we used AT-3 breast cancer cells, a C57BL/6 mouse
breast cancer cell line that expresses modest levels of cell surface CXCR4 and low amounts
of CXCR7 (Fig S3). We implanted AT-3 cells expressing firefly luciferase (AT-3-FL)
orthotopically into 4th inguinal mammary fat pads of control and CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice.
We also implanted mouse mammary fibroblasts stably expressing CXCL12-α to reproduce
secretion of this chemokine by stromal cells in primary human breast cancer (4).
Bioluminescence imaging showed significantly greater growth of AT-3-FL breast cancer
cells in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice on days 7–16 after implantation (p < 0.05) (Fig 1A). We
resected orthotopic tumors ~2 weeks after implantation to simulate treatment of patients
with breast cancer and allow time for disseminated tumor cells to form detectable

metastases. Resected tumors from control and CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice appeared similar by
standard H&E staining and did not differ in relative vascularity assessed by CD31 (Fig 1B).
Tumor blood vessels in control mice demonstrated extensive co-localization of CD31 with
CXCR7, consistent with prior studies showing increased expression of CXCR7 on that
vascular endothelium in breast cancer and other malignancies (Fig 1B) (12). By comparison,
endothelial expression of CXCR7 and co-localization with CD31 were markedly diminished
in tumors from CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice. Immunofluorescence also confirmed expression of
CXCR7 in AT-3-FL cells in the tumor.

After resecting orthotopic tumors, we monitored mice for three more weeks for local
recurrence and metastases before euthanizing mice on the same day. CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND
mice had significantly larger recurrent tumors in the mammary fat pad and greater overall
systemic metastases quantified by bioluminescence (Fig 2A–C). When we analyzed by
distribution of metastases in various anatomic sites, CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had greater
metastatic AT-3-FL cells in all locations, although differences between groups of mice only
were significant for the total abdomen (Fig 2D). Fluorescence microscopy of lungs ex vivo
showed small clusters of metastatic AT-3-FL cells in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice, while control
mice had frequent solitary metastatic breast cancer cells as well as cell clusters (Fig S4).
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice also had more viable, circulating AT-3-FL cells than control
animals (Fig S5). Since bone and bone marrow represent the most common sites of
disseminated tumor cells and breast cancer metastases (29), we also recovered bone marrow
from lower extremities of mice. We categorized mice as positive for tumor cells in bone
marrow based on ex vivo bioluminescence above background levels in five independent
experiments. Greater than 30% of CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had viable disseminated AT-3FL breast cancer cells in bone marrow as compared with less than 15% of controls (Fig 2E).
Overall, these data demonstrate that loss of CXCR7 vascular endothelium results in
markedly greater spontaneous breast cancer metastases to multiple sites.

Author Manuscript

To verify these results with a second breast cancer cell line, we used E0771 breast cancer
cells, an estrogen receptor positive C57BL/6 medullary adenocarcinoma (30). E0771 cells
express low levels of cell surface CXCR7 and no detectable CXCR4 by flow cytometry (Fig
S3). We co-implanted E0771-FL cells and mouse mammary fibroblasts secreting CXCL12
into mammary fat pads of control and CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice. Unlike AT-3-FL tumors,
imaging data showed no difference in growth of E0771 orthotopic tumors through the time
we resected tumors 21 days after implantation (Fig 3A). Immediately after resecting tumors,
both cohorts had comparable bioluminescence, but imaging showed significantly greater
regrowth of E0771-FL cells in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND animals by day 34 (p < 0.05) (Fig 3A).
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice also had significantly shorter survival than control mice when we
monitored animals until euthanized for humane end points or defined as cancer-free based
on lack of bioluminescent signal and palpable tumor at 50 days (p < 0.01) (Fig 3B).
In an independent experiment with orthotopic E0771 tumors, we resected tumor implants
and then euthanized all mice on the same day to quantify spontaneous metastasis.
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had significantly greater overall spontaneous metastases (p < 0.01)
(Fig 4A, B). When analyzed by anatomic location, CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had more
metastases in all body sites, although only differences in abdominal metastases were

significant (p < 0.05) (Fig 4C). As described for AT-3-FL implants, we recovered blood and
bone marrow from extremities and quantified circulating and disseminated tumor cells by ex
vivo bioluminescence. Combining data from four independent experiments, 57 ± 8% of
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had circulating E0771-FL cells, while no control mice had any
detectable viable cells. We also identified a significantly higher percentage of
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice with disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow (p < 0.05); control
mice only had E0771-FL cells in bone marrow in one of four experiments (Fig 4D).
Therefore, we established that CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice have greater spontaneous metastases
using two different breast cancer cell lines.
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice have greater experimentally-induced metastases

Author Manuscript

CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had greater numbers of circulating tumor cells than control animals
using orthotopic implants of either AT-3-FL or E0771-FL cells, respectively. Potentially,
greater metastasis in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice could be due to enhanced ability of malignant
cells to move from a mammary tumor into the vasculature and/or capability of cells to
survive and proliferate in secondary organs.

Author Manuscript

To eliminate steps in metastasis through vascular intravasation from a localized tumor, we
injected breast cancer cells directly into the left ventricle to produce experimental
metastases. After intracardiac injection of AT-3-FL cells, we euthanized all animals 15 days
later to quantify metastases. Bioluminescence imaging immediately after euthanization
showed significantly greater total burden of AT-3-FL cells in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice with
widespread metastases throughout these animals (Fig 5A, B). We observed significantly
greater AT-3-FL cells in multiple organs and tissues, including abdomen, omentum, and liver
(p < 0.05) (Fig 5C). In a separate experiment, we followed mice for survival after
intracardiac injection of AT-3-FL cells instead of euthanizing animals at the same time.
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had significantly shorter survival with 50% of animals reaching
humane endpoints by 18 days (p < 0.05) (Fig 5D). By comparison, 50% of control mice
survived until day 26. CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice also had significantly greater percentages of
mice with disseminated AT-3-FL cells in bone marrow (Fig S6). CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice
with intracardiac injection of E0771 cells also showed a trend toward shorter survival than
control mice, although differences between groups were not significant (Fig S7). These
studies demonstrate that greater metastasis in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice is not solely due to
more intravasation of breast cancer cells from mammary tumors, particularly for AT-3-FL
cells that express both CXCR4 and CXCR7.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Atypical chemokine receptor CXCR7 (ACKR3) is a prominent component of tumor
microenvironments in multiple human cancers. Increased expression of CXCR7 commonly
occurs on malignant cells in several different human cancers, including breast, renal, colon,
and esophagus (14–16, 31). CXCR7 also is expressed by endothelial cells in tumorassociated blood vessels found in primary and metastatic sites (12, 21, 32). Studies in animal
models typically demonstrate that CXCR7 in cancer cells promotes tumor growth and
metastasis (12, 33, 34). While small molecule inhibitors of CXCR7 reduce tumor growth

and metastasis in animal models, these systemic agents affect the receptor on both cancer
and stromal cells (35–37). Therefore, effects of endothelial CXCR7 on cancer progression
remain unknown.

Author Manuscript

To investigate endothelial CXCR7 in cancer, we used a genetically-engineered mouse model
to conditionally delete this receptor from vascular endothelium. Cre-mediated excision of
endothelial CXCR7 in adult mice had no gross phenotype, unlike peri-natal lethality caused
by deleting this receptor from endothelium in utero (19). Using two different syngeneic
breast cancer cell lines, we discovered that mammary tumor implants spontaneously
metastasize more extensively in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice. These mice also had greater
metastases following systemic injection of breast cancer cells, which bypasses the vascular
intravasation step in metastasis. Effects on metastasis occurred without altering overall
CD31+ vasculature in mammary tumors, indicating that endothelial CXCR7 is not required
for tumor angiogenesis in this model.

Author Manuscript

Similar to other members of the newly designated family of atypical chemokine receptors,
CXCR7 functions in part as a scavenger receptor for CXCL12. In cell-based assays, CXCR7
efficiently removes CXCL12 from the extracellular space and degrades it (27, 28). Prior
studies demonstrate that CXCR7 also controls amounts of CXCL12 in living organisms (31,
38). Plasma CXCL12 increases by approximately 4-6-fold in mice with complete knockout
of this receptor from all tissues or treated systemically with an inhibitor of CXCR7. In the
current study, selective genetic deletion of CXCR7 only from vascular endothelium elevates
plasma CXCL12 by ~35% in mice without breast tumors. This result confirms a recent study
by Berahovich et al showing immunodetectable CXCR7 on endothelium of venules in
organs including spleen, lung, and kidney, suggesting that endothelial CXCR7 could control
systemic levels of CXCL12 (38).

Author Manuscript

Local and systemic increases in CXCL12 produce different outcomes, depending on
amounts of CXCL12 and context. In some experimental systems, loss of CXCR7 and
associated elevation of CXCL12 cause phenotypes due to reduced levels of cell surface
CXCR4. CXCR7 scavenging of CXCL12 establishes chemotactic gradients necessary for
migration of lateral line primordial cells in zebrafish and neurons during brain development
in mice (27, 39–42). For both of these systems, loss of CXCR7 produces persistent,
relatively high levels of CXCL12 that cause internalization and degradation of CXCR4 on
migrating cells, resulting in loss of chemotaxis. However, we did not observe reduced levels
of CXCR4 on natural killer cells in bone marrow of CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice (data not
shown), suggesting that modest elevations of CXCL12 in these mice did not affect cell
surface expression of CXCR4. We note that a requirement for CXCR7 scavenging in
CXCL12-CXCR4 chemotaxis depends on overall levels of this chemokine. Using a
microfluidic model of chemotaxis, high levels of CXCL12 produced loss of cell surface
CXCR4 and cell migration in the absence of cells with CXCR7, but cells maintained cell
surface CXCR4 and migrated toward low levels of CXCL12 even without CXCR7
scavenging (43). Reinforcing integrated effects of CXCL12 levels and CXCR7,
CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice did not have greater spontaneous breast cancer metastasis without
co-implanted fibroblasts to reproduce known secretion of CXCL12 by carcinoma-associated
fibroblasts in primary human breast cancer (data not shown) (4, 44).

Modest elevations of plasma CXCL12 in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice may be more consistent
with conditions that maintain CXCR4 signaling to promote tumor progression and
metastasis. The ~35% increase in CXCL12 in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice is similar to the 14%
increase in systemic CXCL12 reported for patients with breast cancer (45). In this clinical
study, progressive increases in CXCL12 correlated with established markers of poor
prognosis, including high grade tumors and basal subtype, suggesting that our mouse model
may reproduce effects of moderately elevated CXCL12 on patient outcomes.

Author Manuscript

CXCL12 regulates multiple steps in tumor growth and metastasis, many of which increased
in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice. In both AT-3 and E0771 orthotopic mammary tumor models,
deletion of endothelial CXCR7 increased circulating tumor cells, suggesting greater vascular
intravasation of breast cancer cells and/or survival in the circulation. CXCR4 and CXCR7
promote cell migration through tissues and resistance to anoikis, processes that would
increase circulating tumor cells (6, 46–48). CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice had greater local
recurrence and spontaneous metastasis to multiple organs including bone marrow, one of the
most common sites of metastatic breast cancer cells in patients. Greater spontaneous
metastases in CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice indicates that elevated CXCL12 may promote
trafficking of circulating tumor cells to CXCL12-rich organs, enhance survival of
disseminated tumor cells in secondary sites, and/or increase proliferation to produce overt
metastases. Increases in growth of breast cancer cells after implantation into mammary fat
pads were more pronounced with AT-3 cells. We note that AT-3 cells express cell surface
CXCR4 and CXCR7, while flow cytometry showed only CXCR7 in E0771. The difference
in initial growth of breast cancer cells in mammary fat pads suggests that CXCL12 signaling
through CXCR4 is more important for this step in tumor progression. Similarly, when we
bypassed the vascular intravasation step by injecting breast cancer cells systemically, we
also determined that only CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice with AT-3 cells had significantly shorter
survival. This result suggests that CXCL12-CXCR7 interactions on cancer cells may
promote intravasation in the mammary tumor environment, which is consistent with a prior
cell culture study demonstrating that CXCR7 functions in transendothelial migration of cells
(46).

Author Manuscript

To nominate other potential mechanisms through which endothelial CXCR7 may regulate
affect breast cancer, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA breast cancer data
base. While we recognize that the TCGA does not segregate expression data by cell type,
endothelial cells in almost all breast cancers express CXCR7. GSEA revealed that CXCR7
correlates negatively with proliferation in comparison with 4 of 5 data sets, suggesting that
loss of endothelial CXCR7 in tumor environments may increase proliferation of breast
cancer cells in primary tumors and/or metastases (Fig S8). In some contexts, endothelial
CXCR7 may increase influx of immune cells into organs and tissues, suggesting potential
effects on tumor immunity and regulation of metastasis by immune cells (49, 50).
While CXCR7 has been reported to increase proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro, this
receptor was not essential for tumor angiogenesis in our mouse model as assessed by CD31
staining of mammary tumors (51) (52). This discordance likely reflects the large number of
cytokines and chemokines that control angiogenesis in living systems, providing redundancy
that compensates for loss of a single molecule. Such redundancy has been evident in

resistance to therapies targeting a single regulator of tumor angiogenesis (53). Previous
studies demonstrate that other tumor endothelial markers do not necessarily decrease tumor
angiogenesis, showing our results are not unique to CXCR7 in tumor vasculature (54, 55).
Further studies are planned to establish functions of endothelial CXCR7 in other types of
cancer and different diseases.

Author Manuscript

Overall, we determined that CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND mice have modestly elevated systemic levels
of CXCL12, showing that endothelial CXCR7 contributes to overall regulation of this
chemokine in vivo. Deletion of endothelial CXCR7 results in greater spontaneous and
experimentally-induced breast cancer metastasis, indicating that vascular CXCR7 suppresses
processes including tumor growth, vascular intravasation, and survival and proliferation of
breast cancer cells in multiple organs and tissues. These data advance our understanding of
CXCR7 and emphasize tissue context-dependent functions of this receptor in cancer. We
note that in some experimental systems, pharmacologic inhibition of a molecular target may
produce different outcomes than genetic deletion in adult animals (56, 57). However, our
results suggest that targeting small molecule inhibitors of CXCR7 selectively to cancer cells,
such as with nanoparticles, may improve therapeutic benefits by blocking oncogenic
functions of this receptor on malignant cells while maintaining effects of endothelial
CXCR7 to limit tumor progression.

Materials and Methods
Cells

Author Manuscript

C57BL/6 mouse breast cancer cell lines AT-3 and E0771 (gifts of Dr. Abrams and Dr.
Mihich, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). We
also cultured immortalized mammary fibroblasts from C57BL/6 mice (gift of Dr. Moses,
Vanderbilt University) in the same medium. We cultured all cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Lentiviruses
We stably transduced mouse mammary fibroblasts with CXCL12-α fused to fluorescent
protein mCherry (MMF-CXCL12) and breast cancer cells with firefly luciferase (AT-3-FL
and E0771-FL, respectively) as described (58, 59).
Mice

Author Manuscript

The University of Michigan Committee for Care and Use of Animals approved all mouse
procedures. We crossed mice with CXCR7 flanked by LoxP sites (gift of ChemoCentryx)
with transgenic mice carrying tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT recombinase under control of
the stem cell leukemia (Scl) stem cell enhancer (gift of Dr. Begley and the University of
Western Australia) for endothelial-specific expression (23, 26). We backcrossed mice 12
generations on a C57BL/6 background.
To activate Cre, we treated mice every other day for seven days with 5 mg/kg taxmoxifen
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in corn oil by intraperitoneal injection. We treated control mice with
vehicle only. We also performed selected experiments with Cre-negative mice treated with

tamoxifen rather than vehicle only and obtained similar results. We verified deletion of
CXCR7 by PCR of tail biopsies. Since mouse tail tissue is well-vascularized, this strategy
has been used previously to verify Cre-mediated deletion of a target gene from endothelium
(24, 25). PCR primers for genotyping are shown in Table 1.
Mouse tumor model

Author Manuscript

We established orthotopic tumors by implanting 2 × 105 breast cancer cells (E0771-FL or
AT-3-FL) with 1 × 105 MMF-CXCL12 cells in 4th inguinal mammary fat pads of agematched, 5–8 week old female CXCR7ΔEND/ΔEND or littermate control mice (n = 8–12 per
group with specific numbers for each experiment listed in figure legends). These samples
sizes are based on prior experience with imaging and disease progression studies in mice.
Mice were assigned to groups based on genotype, and investigators knew the genotype of
experimental groups. To generate systemic metastases, we injected 1 × 105 breast cancer
cells directly into the left ventricle of the heart (n = 8–10 per group as listed in figure
legends). We used bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Spectrum, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA)
to measure tumor burden and metastases as described (60).

Author Manuscript

When experiments were terminated for humane reasons, we injected luciferin i.p. prior to
euthanizing an animal and then imaged metastases immediately after death (31). We
quantified metastases based on region-of-interest analysis of bioluminescence for total body,
chest, and abdomen. We subdivided the chest region into ribs and lungs, while we defined
sub-regions of the abdomen as omentum, liver, and intestines with associated mesenteric
lymph nodes. In selected experiments, we collected blood for circulating tumor cells via a
28 gauge needle inserted into the right side of the heart of anesthetized mice immediately
before euthanization. We cultured blood samples overnight in DMEM growth medium;
washed cells with PBS to remove red blood cells; and then measured firefly luciferase
bioluminescence in cancer cells after one week. To detect tumor cells in bone marrow, we
flushed each femur and tibia with PBS (1 ml per bone); dissociated bone marrow plugs by
repeated pipetting; and then cultured cells in DMEM growth medium for one week. We
quantified relative numbers of viable tumor cells in bone marrow by bioluminescence.
ELISA
We measured levels of CXCL12 in plasma by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s
directions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Immunostaining

Author Manuscript

We fixed tumors in 4% buffered formalin overnight and then embedded tissues in paraffin
for sectioning. To stain CXCR7 in tumor vasculature, we snap froze tumors or livers
(Tissue-TEK®, VWR International, Radnor, PA) for subsequent cryosectioning of samples
at 8 μm thickness. We stained paraffin sections with hematoxylin and eosin for tumor
histology. We identified tumor blood vessels with an antibody to CD31 (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA). In selected experiments, we also stained sections with CXCR7 (11G8, gift of
ChemoCentryx, Mountain View, CA) to co-localize this receptor to tumor blood vessels
(12). For immunostaining of CXCR7 with antibody 11G8, we blocked tumor sections with
0.1 mg/ml Fab fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove,

PA) for one hour to prevent background from mouse-on-mouse staining prior to adding
primary antibodies. For CD31 staining, we quantified the percent area stained with antibody
in four randomly selected 20X microscopic fields using ImageJ (61).
Flow cytometry
We analyzed cell surface expression of CXCR4 or CXCR7 on breast cancer cells with
fluorescent-conjugated antibodies 12G5 and 11G8, respectively (R&D Systems) (62).
GSEA analysis

Author Manuscript

We performed RNAseq data retrieval and normalization as described previously and then
correlated all individual genes to CXCR7 expression in the TCGA breast samples to
generate a pre-ranked list based on Spearman’s Rho (63). To perform Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA), we used the MsigDB collections C2, C5, and C6 (64). We presented
findings for gene sets related to proliferation and also performed an unbiased review of the
top positively and negatively enriched gene sets to nominate potential mechanisms of action.
Statistical analysis
We performed animal studies 2–5 times with independent cohorts of mice. Graphs present
mean values with standard error of the mean (SEM). We analyzed data using one-way
ANOVA (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA) with p ≤ 0.05 defining statistically significant
differences.
