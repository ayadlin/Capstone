Abstract
Markers that could accurately predict responses to the general kinase inhibitor sorafenib are needed to
better leverage its clinical applications. In this study, we examined a hypothesized role in the drug response
for the growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 45β (GADD45β), which is commonly underexpressed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where sorafenib may offer an important new therapeutic option. The anticancer activity of sorafenib-induced GADD45β expression was tested in a panel of HCC cell lines and xenograft models. We found that GADD45β mRNA and protein expression were induced relatively more
prominently in HCC cells that were biologically sensitive to sorafenib treatment. GADD45β induction was
not found after treatment with either the mitogen-activated protein kinase–extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 or the Raf inhibitor ZM336372, suggesting that GADD45β induction by sorafenib was independent of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activity. However, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK) kinase activation occurred preferentially in sorafenib-sensitive cells. Small interfering RNA–mediated
knockdown of GADD45βor JNK kinase limited the proapoptotic effects of sorafenib in sorafenib-sensitive cells.
We defined the −339/−267 region in the GADD45β promoter containing activator protein-1 and SP1-binding
sites as a crucial region for GADD45β induction by sorafenib. Together, our findings suggest that GADD45β
induction contributes to sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCC cells, prompting further studies to validate its
potential value in predicting sorafenib efficacy. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9309–18. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Sorafenib is the first molecular targeted agent that shows
survival benefit for patients with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC; refs. 1, 2). Clinical trials of sorafenib in different stages of HCC and in combination with other treatment approaches are under way to find better treatment
strategies for this difficult disease.
Although sorafenib represents a major breakthrough in the
treatment of advanced HCC, several important issues need to

be addressed to facilitate rational clinical trial design. First,
the downstream mediators of the antitumor effects of
sorafenib should be clarified. Sorafenib was developed in a
program that was designed to find specific Raf kinase inhibitors (3). However, preclinical models indicate that the antitumor activity of sorafenib does not correlate completely
with its inhibitory effects on Raf/mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)/ERK activity (4). Both MEK/ERK-dependent
and -independent mechanisms have been reported to account
for the antitumor activity of sorafenib in various tumor models (5–8). Identification of signaling pathways that are critical
for the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib will help the rational
design of combination therapy for HCC (9).
Second, biomarkers that can predict clinical efficacy after
sorafenib treatment should be developed. Previous studies on
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activity in HCC tumor cells yielded
inconsistent results, and the predictive value of Raf/MEK/
ERK signaling activity for the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC
remains uncertain (10–12). In addition, the main effects of
sorafenib in advanced HCC are seen in tumor stabilization
and survival prolongation. It is difficult to measure efficacy
in individual patients because the objective response rate
of sorafenib is low (2–3%; refs. 1, 2). Surrogate biomarkers
to predict the biological and clinical efficacy of sorafenib will
help tailor treatment on an individual patient basis.

Growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 45β (GADD45β)
belongs to a family of small-molecule (∼18 kDa) proteins that
play important roles in cellular stress response, survival,
senescence, and apoptosis regulation (13). GADD45 family
proteins are frequently underexpressed in various types of
cancers, including HCC (9, 14, 15). GADD45 family proteins
are also important mediators of genotoxic stress-induced
and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)–induced apoptosis (16–18). Recently, we found that GADD45β expression was
induced in HCC cells after sorafenib treatment, and this
induction was independent of MEK/ERK signaling activity
(19). We hypothesized that GADD45β may be an important
mediator of sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. The
present study aimed to explore the biological significance
and possible mechanisms of sorafenib-induced GADD45β
expression in HCC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The HCC cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection, and the Huh-7 cell
line was from the Health Science Research Resources Bank.
A sorafenib-resistant cell line, Huh-7R, was generated by
continuous treatment of Huh-7 cells with sorafenib up to
10 μmol/L. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin
(100 μg/mL), L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), and sodium pyruvate
(1 mmol/L) at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5%
CO2. Primary human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were cultured as described before (5).
Chemicals and other reagents
Sorafenib was provided by Bayer-Schering Pharma. The
MEK inhibitor U0126, the Raf inhibitor ZM336372, and the
c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 were
purchased from Calbiochem, Merck KGaA, and AG Scientific,
respectively. For in vitro experiments, the chemicals were dissolved in DMSO, and the final concentration of DMSO was
kept below 0.1%. For in vivo experiments, sorafenib was dissolved in Cremophor EL/95% ethanol (50:50; Sigma-Aldrich).
The antibodies used for Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays included GADD45β (AV48346 from SigmaAldrich and H-70 from Santa Cruz), ERK-2, phospho-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JNK, phospho-JNK (Thr183/
Tyr185), c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun (Ser63), phospho-c-Jun (Ser73;
Cell Signaling Technology), lamin B, α-tubulin (Calbiochem),
and SP1 (Abcam).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays
Cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay as previously described (5). The IC50 values after drug treatment were
calculated using CompuSyn software (ComboSyn) based on
the changes of absorbance measured by spectrophometry
(DTX 880; Beckman Coulter). The fraction of apoptotic cells
after drug treatment was assessed by sub-G1 fraction analysis
and Annexin V analysis using flow cytometry (5). The poten-

tial synergistic or antagonistic antitumor effects between different drug treatments were measured by median dose-effect
analysis using the combination index (CI)–isobologram
method (20).
Western blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates of HCC cells after drug treatment were
prepared and quantified as previously described (5). Nuclear
and cytoplasmic fractions were extracted with a CMN Compartment Protein Extraction kit (BioChain). SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis were performed to measure protein
expression. Signals were visualized using a UVP Imaging
System (UVP) or with X-ray film.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) using a
high-capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems) and
quantified using the TaqMan-Universal or SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 7900
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primers for the GADD45β and c-Jun genes were purchased from
Applied Biosystems (ABI TaqMan assay ID: Hs00169587_ml
and Hs00277190_s1). Primers for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (sense 5-TGACACTGGCAAAACAATGCA-3 and antisense 5-GGTCCTTTTCACCAGCAAGCT-3)
gene or α-fetoprotein (AFP; ABI TaqMan Hs00173490_m1)
gene were used as endogenous controls. Conditions for
PCR were as follows: 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes,
and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation) and
60°C for 1 minute (annealing/extension). The relative mRNA
amount of the target/control genes was calculated using the
ΔCt (threshold cycle) method: relative expression = 2−ΔCt,
where ΔCt = Ct (target gene) − Ct (control gene).
Small interfering RNA knockdown of
GADD45β expression
The GADD45β and scrambled nonspecific (negative
control) small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were purchased from
Ambion. The sequences for GADD45β siRNA are as follows:
si-GADD45β-a, sense 5′-GCAUACGAGAGACUUGGUUtt-3′
and antisense 5′-AACCAAGUCUCUCGUAUGCag-3′;
si-GADD45β-b, sense 5′-GAAUUAUAGAGACAAUCUAtt-3′
and antisense 5′-UAGAUUGUCUCUAUAAUUCgc-3′. Cells
were transfected with GADD45β or scrambled siRNA using
the siPORT NeoFx siRNA transfection reagent (Ambion),
treated with the drugs at the indicated concentrations for
48 hours, and collected for subsequent Western blot or
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.
Overexpression of GADD45β in HCC cells
HCC cells were transiently transfected with the pCMV6AC-GFP-GADD45β vector (RG213354; Origene Technologies)
or empty vector (pCMV6-AC-GFP; Origene Technologies).
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with
sorafenib (10 μmol/L) or control. Effects of GADD45β overexpression on the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib were
measured by flow cytometry.

lysates after drug treatment were examined by Western blotting.

Luciferase reporter constructs for the
GADD45β promoter
Proximal promoter fragments of GADD45β, spanning −736
to +3, were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in the
pLuc-MCS-base luciferase expression plasmid (Stratagene).
Eleven different GADD45β promoter deletion fragments
were generated by PCR using the sense and antisense primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. A HindIII site was
incorporated into the sense primers, and a BglII site was
incorporated into the antisense primers. The TFSEARCH
program (version 1.3; http://www.cbrc.jp.reserach/db/
TFSEARCH.html) was used to identify possible binding sites
for transcription factors in the GADD45β promoter.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to obtain sequences that were mutated at either the activator protein-1
(AP-1m) or SP1 (SP1m) binding sites or mutated at both sites
(AP-1m +SP1m) using a one-side splicing by overlap extension method (21). The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Conditions for
PCR were as follows: one cycle at 95°C for 15 minutes followed
by 34 cycles at 95°C for 40 seconds, 60°C for 40 seconds, 72°C
for 2 minutes, and a final cycle at 72°C for 10 minutes. Huh-7
genomic DNA was used as the PCR template. PCR products
were digested with HindIII and BglII and purified by phenol-

chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Fragments
were then cloned into the corresponding sites of the pLucMCS basic plasmid and confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Luciferase activity assay
HCC cells were transfected with individual GADD45β
reporter constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with
10 μmol/L sorafenib and incubated for an additional 8 hours.
Cell lysates were prepared to determine GADD45β promoter
activity using a Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Packard)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
ChIP assay
Huh-7 cells (∼5 × 106) with or without sorafenib treatment
were used for ChIP using an EZ-ChIP assay kit (Millipore).
PCR amplification was performed using primers spanning
the c-Jun and SP1 site on GADD45β promoter from nucleotides −341 to −122 (forward 5′-TAGCTGCACTCGCCCTTGT3′ and reverse 5′-GGGAAGCAGCGAAATCCTTC-3′).

GADD45β Induction by Sorafenib in HCC

Results
Sorafenib induces GADD45β expression in HCC cells
independent of MEK/ERK inhibition
The IC50 values of HCC cells after sorafenib treatment
are shown in Fig. 1A. Hep3B and Huh-7R cells were categorized as sorafenib-resistant because their IC50 values
(12–15 μmol/L) exceeded the steady-state concentration
of sorafenib that can be achieved in patients after the recommended dosage (400 mg twice daily; ref. 22). Sorafenib
upregulated GADD45β expression, at both the mRNA and
protein levels, in sorafenib-sensitive, but not in sorafenibresistant, HCC cells (Fig. 1B and C). Treatment of HCC
cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 did not upregulate
GADD45β expression, suggesting that GADD45β upregulation by sorafenib treatment was independent of MEK/ERK
signaling activity (Fig. 1B and C). In addition, treatment of
HCC cells with the Raf inhibitor ZM336372, alone or in
combination with sorafenib, did not change the effects of
sorafenib on GADD45β expression (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting that GADD45β induction by sorafenib was independent of Raf signaling activity.

Because vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) is an important target of sorafenib, we also explore
the effects of VEGFR inhibition on GADD45β expression in
Huh-7 cells and HUVEC. Two multikinase inhibitors, sunitinib
(from Pfizer) and AEE788 (from Novartis), which also target
VEGFR, were used as comparison. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2, sorafenib can induce GADD45β mRNA expression in
both Huh-7 cells and, to a lesser extent, HUVEC. Sunitinib and
AEE788 had negligible effects on GADD45β induction in either
Huh-7 cells or HUVEC. The effects of these drugs on GADD45β
induction do not correlate with their effects on VEGFR phosphorylation. Therefore, our data do not support a direct relationship between inhibition of VEGFR activity and induction
of GADD45β.
GADD45β expression contributes to sorafenib-induced
apoptosis in HCC cells
Knockdown of GADD45β expression by siRNA diminished
the expression of GADD45β induced by sorafenib (Fig. 2A
and B). GADD45β knockdown partially abrogated the apoptosis induced by sorafenib in sorafenib-sensitive HCC cells
(Huh-7 and HepG2) but not in sorafenib-resistant Hep3B

cells (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S3). Transfection of
GADD45β into the sorafenib-resistant Huh-7R cells increased
apoptosis induced by sorafenib but had no effects on the
parental Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2D).
AP-1 and SP1 regulate GADD45β expression induced
by sorafenib
To explore the regulatory mechanisms of GADD45β transcription, a series of luciferase reporter plasmids with deletions in the 5′-flanking region of the GADD45β promoter
were generated (Fig. 3A). The results of luciferase assays
indicated that the region −339/−267 in the 5′-flanking region
of the GADD45β promoter was crucial for GADD45β induction by sorafenib (Fig. 3A). Potential binding sites for AP-1
(−298/−292) and SP1 (−285/−277) were identified using the
TFSEARCH program (Fig. 3B). Binding of c-Jun, the main
factor of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, and SP1 to
the GADD45β promoter was confirmed by ChIP (Fig. 3C). To
confirm the biological role of these potential binding sites,
the pLuc-MCS-GADD45β (−339/+3) construct was used to
generate mutations in the AP-1 and SP1 binding sites. Results
of luciferase activity assays indicated that mutations in both
the AP-1 (AP-1m) and the SP1 (SP1m) sites completely abolish the luciferase activity of the promoter constructs after
sorafenib treatment, whereas mutation in either site alone
partially decreased the luciferase activity.
Inhibition of JNK signaling partially abrogates
GADD45β expression and apoptosis induced
by sorafenib
The effects of sorafenib treatment on JNK signaling activity
are shown in Fig. 4. Sorafenib, but not the MEK inhibitor U0126,
increased phosphorylation of JNK in sorafenib-sensitive, but
not in sorafenib-resistant, HCC cells. Both total and phosphoc-Jun levels were also increased more prominently in sorafenibsensitive HCC cells. On the other hand, the level of SP1 did not

change significantly after sorafenib treatment (Fig. 4A). Activation of JNK signaling by sorafenib increased the cytosolic
and nuclear levels of c-Jun and GADD45β (Fig. 4B), which
may then have regulated downstream effectors of apoptosis.
The specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 was used to examine
the effects of JNK signaling on GADD45β expression.
SP600125 inhibited c-Jun and GADD45β mRNA and protein
expression induced by sorafenib in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 5A
and B). Although SP600125 could also induce apoptosis in
Huh-7 cells (Fig. 5C), its effects antagonized the proapoptotic
effects of sorafenib, as shown by median dose-effect analysis
(Fig. 5D). The above results indicated that sorafenib induced
GADD45β expression by activating the JNK signaling pathway.
In vivo evidence of GADD45β induction as a predictive
biomarker of the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib
To compare the effects of sorafenib in sensitive and
resistant HCC cells in vivo, Huh-7 and Huh-7R cells were used
to develop xenograft models. Treatment with sorafenib
(15 mg/kg/d) inhibited tumor growth significantly in Huh-7
xenograft (P < 0.0001, compared with vehicle treatment) but
not in Huh-7R xenograft (P = 0.10; Fig. 6A). Induction of JNK
signaling activity (Fig. 6B) and GADD45β mRNA and protein
expression (Fig. 6C) was evident in Huh-7, but not in Huh-7R,
xenografts. The above data suggested that the induction of
JNK signaling and GADD45β expression after sorafenib treatment may help predict the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib in
HCC. Induction of tumor cell apoptosis (measured by TUNEL
assay) and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is prominent in
Huh-7 model, but negligible in Huh-7R model (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In this study, we showed that sorafenib can induce
GADD45β expression in HCC cells, and failure of GADD45β
induction may confer resistance to sorafenib-induced

GADD45β Induction by Sorafenib in HCC

apoptosis. We also showed that GADD45β induction is
mediated by the cellular JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway but
not by Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Our data broaden the understanding of the antitumor mechanism of sorafenib in HCC
and suggest the possibility of using GADD45β as a predictive
biomarker for sorafenib sensitivity in HCC.
Extensive studies have been performed to verify the role
of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways in the antitumor
mechanisms of sorafenib, but cumulative evidence indicates
that mediators independent of MEK/ERK signaling also play
important roles in sorafenib-induced apoptosis in cancer
cells (10, 23). Examples of these kinds of mediators include
myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), the translation initiation
factor eIF4E, and apoptosis-inducing factor (7, 8). The fact
that sorafenib can induce GADD45β expression, whereas
the MEK inhibitor U0126 and the Raf inhibitor ZM

factor that mediates sorafenib-induced apoptosis through
MEK/ERK-independent mechanisms. The correlation between GADD45β induction and the sensitivity of HCC cells
to sorafenib treatment shown in this study suggests that
GADD45β induction may be related to the resistance mechanisms of HCC cells to sorafenib. Further studies are
needed to explore the relationship between GADD45β and
other MEK/ERK-dependent or independent mediators in
predicting the treatment efficacy of sorafenib. Validation
of their predicting values in human HCC tumor tissue is
also necessary.
The effects of GADD45β induction on cell survival depends
on the types of stimuli, the cell types tested, and the interaction between GADD45β and the different cellular MAPK
pathways. GADD45β mediates TGF-β–induced apoptosis in

s.c into male BALB/c athymic nude mice. Mice were treated daily by gavage as indicated (V, vehicle; S15, sorafenib 15 mg/kg/d). A, difference in
tumor growth. B, difference in JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation measured by Western blotting. C, difference in GADD45β mRNA and protein expression
measured by real-time qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. GADD45β mRNA was expressed relative to endogenous AFP
expression. D, difference in tumor cell apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis measured by TUNEL assay and microvessel density (MVD). Quantification of
apoptosis and MVD was done by manual counting of TUNEL (+) cells and CD31 (+) microvessels, respectively, under high-power field (HPF, 200×).
The numbers were the average of counting 4 HPF in each sample. **, P < 0.01, compared with the control (vehicle-treated) group.

GADD45β Induction by Sorafenib in HCC

pancreatic cancer cell lines and in murine hepatocytes by
activating the p38 MAPK pathway (18, 24). On the other hand,
GADD45β antagonizes tumor necrosis factor-α–induced
apoptosis in murine embryonal fibroblasts and UV- or
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cells by
inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway (25–27). The latter
seemed contradictory to our findings. Although we found that
JNK activation by sorafenib can induce GADD45β expression
and apoptosis, other investigators showed that GADD45β can
inhibit JNK signaling activity by interacting with the upstream
MAPK kinase-4 and MAPK kinase-7 and thus prevent apoptosis (25, 28). These findings suggest that GADD45β and the JNK
signaling pathway may regulate each other in a feedback loop
to control the cellular response to environmental stress.
GADD45β and the JNK signaling pathway may play contradictory roles in hepatocyte survival and liver carcinogenesis.
GADD45β is induced early in the liver regeneration process
after partial hepatectomy and promotes hepatocyte survival
by inhibiting MKK-7 and JNK signaling (29, 30). However,
the findings that GADD45β expression is frequently suppressed in HCC tumor cells suggest that GADD45β may play
growth inhibitory roles during the carcinogenesis process (15).
Similarly, JNK signaling may act either as a proapoptotic or a
prosurvival factor in different context. In liver regeneration
models, JNK signaling is proapoptotic, and inhibition of
JNK signaling via the interaction between GADD45β and upstream MKK-7 can promote hepatocyte survival (28). In the
diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC model, on the other hand,
JNK signaling activity can increase HCC cell proliferation by
inducing c-Myc expression and inhibiting the expression of
the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (31). The effects of molecular targeted therapy on JNK signaling activity in cancer cells have
not yet been clarified, and further investigation is warranted
to explore new therapeutic strategies.
In addition to the JNK signaling pathway, GADD45β expression is also regulated by other mechanisms, including
the NF-κB and the Smad signaling pathways (24, 25). Besides,
GADD45β expression may be affected by the methylation

status of its promoter region (32, 33). It has been suggested
that GADD45 proteins, as cellular sensors to environmental
stress, may coordinate the cellular stress response, depending on the types and intensity of stress, the types and levels of
interacting proteins, and the specific cell types (34, 35). Other
GADD family proteins, including GADD45α and GADD45γ,
have been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis
in various cancer models (36–38). The expression levels and
functional significance of other GADD45 family proteins in
HCC should also be explored for a better understanding of
the regulatory roles of GADD45 family proteins in HCC cell
growth and apoptosis.
In conclusion, GADD45β induction contributes to sorafenibinduced apoptosis in HCC cells. Future studies are needed to
validate its value in predicting sorafenib efficacy.
