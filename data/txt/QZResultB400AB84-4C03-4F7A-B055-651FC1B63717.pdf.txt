Abstract
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression is elevated
in advanced breast cancer and promotes metastasis. Chemotherapy response is only transient in most metastatic diseases.
In the present study, we examined whether CTGF expression
could confer drug resistance in human breast cancer. In breast
cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
CTGF expression was inversely associated with chemotherapy
response. Overexpression of CTGF in MCF7 cells (MCF7/CTGF)
enhanced clonogenic ability, cell viability, and resistance to
apoptosis on exposure to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Reducing
the CTGF level in MDA-MB-231 (MDA231) cells by antisense
CTGF cDNA (MDA231/AS cells) mitigated this drug resistance
capacity. CTGF overexpression resulted in resistance to
doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1
(cIAP1). Knockdown of Bcl-xL or cIAP1 with specific small
interfering RNAs abolished the CTGF-mediated resistance to
apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agents in
MCF7/CTGF cells. Inhibition of extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK)-1/2 effectively reversed the resistance to apoptosis
as well as the up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1 in MCF7/CTGF
cells. A neutralizing antibody against integrin AvB3 significantly
attenuated CTGF-mediated ERK1/2 activation and upregulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1, indicating that the integrin
AvB3/ERK1/2 signaling pathway is essential for CTGF functions.
The Bcl-xL level also correlated with the CTGF level in breast
cancer patients. We also found that a COOH-terminal domain
peptide from CTGF could exert activities similar to full-length
CTGF, in activation of ERK1/2, up-regulation of Bcl-xL/cIAP1,
and resistance to apoptosis. We conclude that CTGF expression
could confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents through
augmenting a survival pathway through ERK1/2-dependent
Bcl-xL/cIAP1 up-regulation. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3482–91]

Introduction
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CTGF/
CCN2, belongs to the CCN family (1), consisting of six members:
CTGF, NOVH, CYR61, WISP-1, WISP-2, and WISP-3 (2), all of which

possessing an NH2-terminal signal peptide indicative of their
secreted protein nature. The biological properties of CCN proteins
include the stimulation of cellular proliferation, migration, adhesion,
and extracellular matrix formation, as well as the regulation of
angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. CTGF is a secreted growth factor
that can bind to integrins on the cell surface (3) and also serves
as an angiogenic factor in collaboration with matrix metalloproteinases (4). Elevated CTGF expression has been observed in breast
cancers (5), pancreatic cancers (6), melanomas (7), and chondrosarcomas (8). Although CTGF shows multiple roles in various cancer
types, in breast tumor cells CTGF overexpression has been linked to
tumor size increase and lymph node metastasis (5, 9). Use of in vitro
and in vivo selection models and large-scale microarray analysis has
shown that CTGF is critically involved in the formation of osteolytic
bone metastasis in breast cancer (10, 11). In our previous study,
CTGF promoted metastasis of breast cancer cells via an integrin
avh3-extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2–dependent,
S100A4-upregulated pathway. Thus, CTGF may play an important
role in breast cancer progression and metastasis.
Despite the proven survival benefit of systemic adjuvant
chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, a significant number of
them still develop metastatic diseases and respond only transiently
to conventional treatments leading to eventual mortality. In
Greenberg’s report, only 16.6% of metastatic breast cancer patients
achieved complete response by cytotoxic chemotherapy (12). Even
with targeted therapy using trastuzumab against HER2/neu
overexpressing breast cancer, complete response was <10% in
Slamon’s series (13). It has been proposed that metastatic cancer
cells deregulate apoptotic modulators and that this plays a crucial
role during the metastatic process (14–16). Because most of the
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptosis of cancer
cells, we speculate that an increased resistance to drug-induced
apoptosis in metastatic cancer cells might be the cause of poor
response in metastatic breast cancer patients.
Taking into account that CTGF plays an important role in breast
cancer metastasis and that metastatic cancer cells usually show
resistance to apoptotic stress, we postulated that CTGF expression
would increase drug resistance in breast cancer cells. It is still unclear
whether CTGF expression would deregulate apoptotic modulators
or would confer drug resistance in breast cancer cells. We herein
examined the effects of CTGF on the survival and chemosensitivity of
breast cancer cells and the signaling pathways involved therein.

resection specimens. CTGF protein was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of carcinoma cells. Staining intensity was scored as indicated.
B, association between CTGF expression level and chemotherapy response of patients with breast cancer. C, clonogenic ability of MCF7/neo and MCF7/CTGF. Cells
were treated with various concentrations of paclitaxel or doxorubicin for 24 h and then refed with fresh medium. After 2 wk of culture, the colonies were stained
with crystal violet and counted. Each experiment was done in triplicate. D, cell viability of MCF7/neo and MCF7/CTGF on exposure to chemotherapy drugs. Cells were
cultured in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of paclitaxel or doxorubicin until the untreated control cells reached confluence.
Cell viability and IC50 values were then determined by using the MTT assay. P < 0.005, Student’s t test.

Taiwan University Hospital were included. Paraffin-embedded, formalinfixed surgical resection specimens were collected for immunohistochemical
staining for CTGF. Tumor size, local invasion, and lymph node metastasis
were acquired from pathology reports. Prechemotherapy tumor burden
was estimated by tumor dimension acquired either by image or direct
measurement of the breast tumor. Postchemotherapy tumor dimensions
were acquired from the final pathology report after surgery. Chemotherapy
response was determined as a change in tumor volume.
Cell culture, antibodies, and reagents. Human breast cancer cell
lines MCF7 and MDA231 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. BT474, BT483, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-435 cells
were generously provided by the National Health Research Institute
(Chunan, Taiwan). These cell lines were maintained in DMEM or MEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and
100 units/mL penicillin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Integrin avh3,
a-tubulin, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, CTGF, Bcl-xL, phosphorylated focal adhesion
kinase (p-FAK), FAK, p-Src, Src, p-AKT, AKT, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) antibodies were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. CTGF antibody was from BD
Biosciences. Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with either
FITC or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate were purchased from

Jackson ImmunoResearch. Antibody-bound protein bands were detected
with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) and photographed with Kodak X-Omat Blue autoradiography film
(Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). The constitutively active mutant of mitogenactivated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-1 construct (a substitution of
the regulatory phosphorylation sites, Ser218 and Ser222, with aspartic acid
S218D/S222D mutant) was a gift from Dr. Ruey-Hwa Chen and has been
described previously (17). The primer sequences for PCR are shown in
Supplementary Table S3.
Immunohistochemical staining. For immunohistochemical staining,
with the procedure previously described (18), CTGF, Bcl-xL, and cIAP1
expression were evaluated by our pathologist using a semiquantitative
weighted histoscore method. We have randomly chosen five low-power
views. The immunohistochemistry results were scored by taking the
percentage of positivity and intensity of staining into account. The
intensity score was given as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak positivity; 2,
moderate positivity; and 3, strong positivity. The percentage of positivity
was multiplied by the intensity score to obtain a final value designated as
the immunohistochemistry score. The sums of five immunohistochemistry
scores represent the CTGF, Bcl-xL, or cIAP1 expression of breast cancer.
The sum of an immunohistochemistry score z2 was defined as high
expression.

Detection of sub-G1 cells by flow cytometry. Adherent and detached
cells were collected after trypsin detachment. Cells were washed with
ice-cold PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at 20jC for at least 1 h.
After fixation, cells were washed twice, incubated in 0.5 mL of 0.5% Triton

X-100/PBS at 37jC for 30 min with 1 mg/mL of RNase A, and stained with
0.5 mL of 50 mg/mL propidium iodide for 10 min. Fluorescence emitted from
the propidium iodide-DNA complex was quantified after laser excitation of

Connective Tissue Growth Factor and Drug Resistance

Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling assay. The terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technology used was the
DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega). For TUNEL staining, all
fixation and staining procedures were conducted at room temperature.
Slides were prepared with 2  105 cells on each slide. Then these slides were
treated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were
counterstained with propidium iodide for 12 h at 4jC. The localized green
fluorescence of apoptotic cells was detected by fluorescence microscopy.
Recombinant CTGF. Suspension FreeStyle 293-F cells (Invitrogen) at a
density of 1.1  106/mL were transfected with CTGF expression vector with
the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After culture at 37jC with 8% CO2 and 92%
air in an orbital shaker for 48 h, conditioned medium was collected. To
ultrafilter and concentrate the dilute protein sample, Amicon Ultra-15
devices (Millipore) were used for rapid separation of recombinant CTGF
(rCTGF) protein without any loss of activity.
Small interfering RNA treatment for Bcl-xL. SiRNA for Bcl-xL was
designed and synthesized using the software and Stealth siRNA duplex
oligoribonucleotides from Invitrogen. Of the small interfering RNA (siRNA)
constructs tested, the greatest knockdown was seen with the oligo targeting
Bcl-xL (5¶-AGGAGAGAAAGUCAACCACCAGCUC-3¶). We used si-GAPDH
(Ambion) as the control siRNA. Inhibition of Bcl-xL expression was assessed
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses following
transfection of human breast cancer cells with Bcl-xL siRNA (siBcl-xL).
Briefly, cells were grown in 6-cm dishes and transiently transfected with 50
pmol of siRNA using 8 Ag of TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) in a
total transfection volume of 2 mL of serum-free DMEM. After incubation at
37jC with 5% CO2 for 8 h, 2 mL of DMEM containing 20% normal growth
medium were added. Samples were then prepared and analyzed by RT-PCR,
Western blot, and invasion assays.
Statistical analysis. All observations were confirmed by at least three
independent experiments. The data are presented as means F SD. Student’s
t test (paired and unpaired) was used to evaluate the statistical significance
of mean values. Levels of statistical significance were P < 0.05 and P < 0.005.
All P values were two-tailed.

Results
CTGF expression is inversely associated with chemotherapeutic response in breast cancer patients. CTGF has been
shown to play an important role in breast cancer metastasis and
also associated with increased tumor size and lymph node
metastasis (5, 9). Because highly metastatic cancer cells exhibit a
drug-resistant phenotype (14), we speculated that CTGF expression
might increase drug resistance in breast cancer cells. To investigate
the effect of CTGF expression and the chemotherapy response in
breast cancer patients, 58 tumors from breast cancer patients
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed immunohistochemically for CTGF expression from their surgical resection
specimen. Patients were divided into two groups: those with
tumors expressing low levels of CTGF (scores 0 and 1, Fig. 1A) and
those with tumors expressing high levels of CTGF (scores 2 and 3,
Fig. 1A). Twenty-three (40%) tumors had low CTGF expression and
35 (60%) tumors had high CTGF expression. Chemotherapy
response was defined as the quotient of postchemotherapy
tumor burden divided by prechemotherapy tumor burden
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients with low levels of CTGF
expression had a better chemotherapy response than those with
high levels of CTGF expression (response quotients, 0.16 F 0.05
versus 0.91 F 0.28; P < 0.05, t test), indicating that breast cancer
patients with a higher CTGF expression had a poorer response to
chemotherapy (Fig. 1B). We have similar results from diagnostic
biopsy (data not shown). There was no difference in age, hormone

status, HER2/neu, tumor grade, tumor size, and stage between
these two groups (Supplementary Table S1).
CTGF enhanced clonogenic ability and viability in response
to chemotherapeutic agents in human breast cancer cells.
In our previous study, we found that MCF7 cells expressed low
levels of CTGF, whereas MDA231 cells expressed abundant CTGF
(9). To confirm that CTGF could confer drug resistance in breast
cancer cells, we established MCF7/CTGF cells overexpressing
CTGF and MDA231/AS cells in which CTGF expression was
reduced by transfection with antisense-oriented CTGF. As
previously reported, no appreciable difference in cell growth ability
was evident among these cells at 24, 48, and 72 hours after plating
(9), as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay (data not shown).
Overexpressing CTGF in MCF7 cells significantly increased their
clonogenic ability on exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin at
various doses (Fig. 1C), whereas decreased CTGF expression in
MDA231 cells drastically decreased their clonogenic ability on
exposure to these drugs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence, we suggest
that elevated CTGF levels can increase the clonogenic ability of
breast cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents.
To determine the magnitude of CTGF expression affecting
chemosensitivity toward paclitaxel and doxorubicin, the IC50 of
proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in these breast cancer
cells at 24 hours after exposure to paclitaxel or doxorubicin.
MCF7/CTGF cells had greater cell viability than the MCF7/neo
control cells in response to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Fig. 1D).
Similarly, reducing CTGF expression in MDA231 cells drastically
reduced cell viability on exposure to these chemotherapeutic
agents (Supplementary Fig. S3). The IC50 values of the MCF7/CTGF
cells toward doxorubicin and paclitaxel were nearly 7 and
15 times higher than those of the MCF7/neo cells, respectively
(10.43 F 4.02 versus 1.48 F 0.22 Amol/L and 6.30 F 0.89 versus
0.41 F 0.11 Amol/L; P < 0.01, t test). The IC50 values of the
MDA231/neo cells toward doxorubicin and paclitaxel were
nearly 17 and 9 times higher than those of the MDA231/AS
cells, respectively (1.50 F 0.39 versus 0.09 F 0.01 Amol/L and
5.13 F 0.87 versus 0.55 F 0.08 Amol/L; P < 0.01, t test;
Supplementary Table S2). These results indicate that expression
of CTGF enhances resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in
human breast cancer cells.
CTGF increased resistance to apoptosis induced by
paclitaxel and doxorubicin in breast cancer cells. To confirm
that CTGF-induced drug resistance is mediated through inhibition
of apoptosis, we exposed cells to paclitaxel and doxorubicin
and subjected them to apoptosis assays. MCF7/CTGF cells
exhibited increased resistance to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel
and doxorubicin as quantitatively determined by TUNEL assay
(Fig. 2A, left). Thirty-seven percent of cells were induced into
apoptosis in MCF7/neo cells after exposure to 5 Amol/L paclitaxel
for 24 hours; in contrast, only 15% were induced in MCF7/CTGF
cells (P < 0.05, t test). Similarly, the percentage of apoptotic cells
was also higher in MCF7/neo cells than in MCF7/CTGF cells on
exposure to 10 Amol/L doxorubicin for 24 hours (41 F 5% versus
26 F 5%; P < 0.05, t test). Reducing CTGF expression in MDA231
cells greatly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by
paclitaxel and doxorubicin. When exposed to paclitaxel and
doxorubicin, apoptotic cells were 22% and 29% in MDA231/neo
cells versus 47% and 44% in MDA231/AS cells, respectively (Fig. 2A,
right; P < 0.05, t test). Apoptosis was further verified by PARP
cleavage. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin treatment caused robust

or undetectable CTGF mRNA, whereas MDA231 and MDA435
cells expressed it in abundant levels (9). Western blots revealed
that protein expression was correlated with mRNA level in all
these cells (Supplementary Fig. S4, top). To investigate the effects
of endogenous CTGF in other breast cancer cells, we treated
those cells with CTGF antiserum and examined the effects on
drug resistance. Treatment with CTGF antiserum did not impair
cell viability, suggesting that CTGF expression is not essential
for cell growth. Administration of CTGF antiserum in combination
with paclitaxel significantly decreased cell viability in MDA231
and MDA435 cells. Conversely, it did not increase the drug
sensitivity in T47D, BT483, and MCF7 cells, all of which showed low
or undetectable CTGF levels (Supplementary Fig. S4, bottom).
These results suggest that a CTGF-induced outside-in signaling

pathway contributed to the resistance to apoptosis induced by
paclitaxel.
Bcl-xL and cIAP1 are downstream effectors of CTGF. To
investigate the molecular mechanism of the antiapoptotic properties of CTGF, we examined the expression of Bcl-2 and inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins by RT-PCR and Western
blot. The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-xL and cIAP1 were
both up-regulated by CTGF (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the
up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1 were the crucial determinants of
the resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in these cells, we assessed
the effects of siRNA targeting Bcl-xL and cIAP1 on apoptosis
sensitivity in MCF7/CTGF cells. The siRNA targeting Bcl-xL or
cIAP1 effectively down-regulated expression of the target proteins,
compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 3B, top). Then, the MCF7

Connective Tissue Growth Factor and Drug Resistance

cells were exposed to paclitaxel after siRNA treatment and were
further analyzed by TUNEL and MTT assays. Paclitaxel induced
apoptosis in 31% of MCF7/neo cells and 9% of MCF7/CTGF cells.
Transfection with siRNA targeting Bcl-xL increased the apoptosis
percentage from 9% to 20% in MCF7/CTGF cells but did not
increase apoptosis in MCF7/neo cell cultures. The siRNA targeting
cIAP1 had similar effects and increased apoptosis in MCF7/CTGF
cells to 23%. Both siRNAs significantly increased apoptosis in
MCF7/CTGF cells but did not manifest any effects in MCF7/neo
cells (Fig. 3B, bottom). We also found that both siRNAs had similar
effects on decreasing cell viability after exposure to paclitaxel in
MCF7/CTGF cells (data not shown). According to these results,
both Bcl-xL and cIAP1 are important downstream effectors in
CTGF-enhanced drug resistance in MCF7 cells.
Furthermore, transfection with Bcl-xL or cIAP1 vectors successfully increased the corresponding protein levels in MDA231/AS
cells (Fig. 3C, top), suggesting that down-regulation of Bcl-xL and
cIAP1 contributed to increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis,
whereas restoring the levels of Bcl-xL or cIAP1 decreased apoptosis
from 52% to 34% and 26%, respectively, after exposure to paclitaxel
(Fig. 3C, bottom). These results suggest that CTGF expression
conferred resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in breast cancer
cells via up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1.
Integrin AvB3–dependent ERK1/2 activation is required for
CTGF-conferred drug resistance. CTGF exerts a range of diverse
functions by binding with cell surface integrins, including isoforms
avh3, aIIbh3, aMh2, a5h1, and a6h1 (19–22). Most integrins activate
FAK and thereby also Src-family kinases, which causes the
phosphorylation of and therefore signaling from p130CAS and
paxillin (23). Here, we found that CTGF expression also dramatically induced FAK and Src phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Similar
results were also observed with rCTGF (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Bcl-xL and cIAP1 protein expression were induced in
f120 minutes (data not shown). Earlier we have observed that
integrin avh3 was essential for CTGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (9). In addition, integrin avh3–blocking antibody inhibited
FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as Bcl-xL and cIAP1
protein expression in MCF7/CTGF cells. Treatment with integrin
avh3–blocking antibody also increased paclitaxel-induced cell
death in MCF7/CTGF cells but not in IgG-treated cells (Fig. 4B).
The ERK1/2 pathway has previously been implicated in cellular
protection from various apoptotic signals (19, 24–27). Inhibition of
MEK1 activity has been reported to down-regulate Bcl-xL protein
expression and promoter activity and to enhance susceptibility to
cell death induction (28). The MEK/ERK pathway also mediates
tumor necrosis factor-a induced cIAP1 expression in human
endothelial cells (29). To examine whether ERK1/2 activation
contributed to the resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in
these cells, the MEK1-specific inhibitor PD98059 and a constitutively active mutant MEK1 were used to modulate the ERK1/2
phosphorylation status. PD98059 effectively inhibited ERK1/2
phosphorylation and Bcl-xL and cIAP1 levels in MCF7/CTGF cells
(Fig. 4C, top). The sub-G1 population of MCF7/CTGF cells induced
by paclitaxel significantly increased from 15% to 22% after PD98059
treatment, whereas the control cells exhibited no change. There
was no sub-G1 population difference in these cells after treatment
with PD98059 (Fig. 4C, bottom). On the other hand, transfection
with constitutively active MEK1 caused ERK1/2 rephosphorylation
and restored Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression in MDA231/AS cells
(Fig. 4D, top). In addition, transfection with constitutively active
MEK1 in MDA231/AS cells decreased sub-G1 cells from 44% to 26%,

and there was no significant difference between MDA231/AS and
MDA231/neo cells (Fig. 4D, bottom). These results indicated that
the ERK1/2 pathway is essential for CTGF-mediated drug
resistance and that the integrin avh3/FAK/ERK1/2 pathway is
critical for CTGF-induced ERK1/2 activation and subsequent drug
resistance.
COOH-terminal domain is critical for CTGF function in
drug resistance. CTGF has four structural modules that resemble
an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain (module 1), a von
Willebrand factor type C repeat (module 2), a thrombospondin type
I repeat (module 3), and a COOH-terminal domain (CT) that
contains a putative cysteine knot (module 4; Supplementary
Fig. S6) A previous study suggests that the CT could bind to
integrin avh3 (30). Hence, we hypothesized that the CT could
confer drug resistance to breast cancer cells via binding to integrin
avh3. We transfected MCF7 cells with plasmids expressing CT
and found that both full-length CTGF and CT had similar effects
on activating FAK and ERK1/2; moreover, expression of CT also
up-regulated Bcl-xL and cIAP1 in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A). To examine
whether CT expression could confer drug resistance in breast
cancer cells, we performed an MTT assay in these stable cells after
exposing them to paclitaxel. As we speculated, MCF7/CTGF and
MCF7/CT had similar viability profiles after exposure to various
concentrations of paclitaxel (Fig. 5B). We further synthesized a
recombinant CT peptide (rCT) and found that rCT treatment
activated the FAK/ERK1/2 pathway and up-regulated Bcl-xL and
cIAP1 expression in MCF7 cells (Fig. 5C). rCT could also reduce
PARP cleavage dramatically in both MDA231/AS and MCF7 cells
induced by paclitaxel (Fig. 5D). The above data indicated that CT
exhibits similar activity as full-length CTGF to induce drug
resistance in breast cancer cells.
CTGF expression is associated with Bcl-xL expression in
breast cancer patients. Having shown the inverse association of
CTGF expression with chemotherapy response in breast cancer
patients (Fig. 1), we further investigated whether the CTGF level
correlated with Bcl-xL and cIAP1 in breast cancer patients. Hence,
we examined Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression by immunohistochemical staining in serial histologic sections of the same patient
group studied in Fig. 1 (Fig. 6). Among patients who had a high
CTGF expression level, 74% also highly expressed Bcl-xL, whereas
in the low CTGF expression group, only 39% expressed high Bcl-xL
(P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test.). In addition, the CTGF level had a
tendency to always be associated with the cIAP1 level, although
the P value did not reach statistically significant levels (P = 0.29;
Table 1). These data agreed with our in vitro results that CTGF
expression up-regulated Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression.

Discussion
In this study, we show that CTGF overexpression in human
breast cancer cells enhances chemoresistance through inhibition of
apoptosis. The apoptosis inhibition was accompanied by decreased
PARP cleavage and a reduction in the sub-G1 population as evinced
by nuclear condensation and TUNEL assays. CTGF overexpression
resulted in specific up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1, although the
expression levels of the others remained unchanged. We also
showed that activation of ERK1/2 via the integrin avh3/FAK
pathway by CTGF is responsible for up-regulation of Bcl-xL and
cIAP1, and that its inactivation effectively reverses both the
resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and the up-regulation of
Bcl-xL and cIAP1 in CTGF-overexpressing cells. Thus, CTGF

confers drug resistance in breast cancer cells by increasing
resistance to apoptosis through integrin avh3/FAK/ERK1/2–
mediated up-regulation of the Bcl-xL and cIAP1 survival pathway.
Recently, CTGF has been reported to have an important role in
wound healing and fibrotic disease, whereas CTGF is also reported
to be critical in tumor development and progression (5, 31–33), as
well as in tumor cell survival (34). In this study, we noticed that
activation of ERK1/2 also up-regulated Bcl-xL and cIAP1, which
are considered to be antiapoptotic proteins. The role of Bcl-xL in
exerting resistance to chemotherapy treatment with conventional
antineoplastic agents was first suggested when it was observed
that the expression of Erb-B2 (Her-2/neu) in breast cancer cells
increased the Bcl-xL level and rendered the cells resistant
to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis (35). CTGF-induced Bcl-xL
up-regulation is compatible with previous observations that CTGF
is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients and
the enhanced metastatic ability of breast cancer cells. IAPs are a
family of antiapoptotic proteins characterized by the presence of

baculoviral IAP repeat domains (36), which modulate apoptosis by
binding and inactivating caspases (37). In the present study, we
proposed a novel mechanism in which CTGF could up-regulate
cIAP1 and thereby confer resistance to drug-induced apoptosis.
Knockdown of Bcl-xL or cIAP1 in MCF7/CTGF cells increased
drug-induced apoptosis. Likewise, restoring Bcl-xL and cIAP1 in
MDA231/AS cells reduced drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, we
concluded that both Bcl-xL and cIAP1 play important roles in
CTGF-induced drug resistance.
Using immunohistochemical staining, we examined 58 breast
cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and observed
a correlation between the CTGF level and a reduction in
chemotherapy response. No pathologic complete response was
found in our patient samples. Three patients in the low CTGF
group had only residual tumor cells and one had no residual tumor
cells after chemotherapy. In Mauri’s review article, rates of pathologic response are low among these studies (ranging from 4% to
29%; ref. 38). Absence of pathological complete response might be
due to a limited number of patients involved in this study. Patients
with high CTGF had a significantly lower chemotherapy response
than those in the low CTGF group. Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression
were also examined in these patients by immunohistochemistry in
serial sections. Both Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression levels correlated
with the CTGF level although cIAP1 expression did not reach statistically significant. This supports our in vitro experiment showing
that CTGF up-regulated Bcl-xL and cIAP1 expression.
CTGF antiserum reduced cell viability when cotreated with
chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel. Overexpression of CTGF in MCF7 cells significantly increased
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and reducing CTGF
expression in MDA231 cells decreased anchorage-independent
growth. In Dornhöfer’s study, a specific monoclonal antibody
against CTGF could suppress anchorage-independent growth in
soft agar and inhibit tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in

mouse xenograft model pancreatic cancer cells (39). In conformity to our previous data that a neutralizing antibody could reverse the effects of CTGF overexpression, CTGF neutralizing
antibody may not only increase chemotherapy response in breast
cancer but may also be able to decrease micrometastasis and
tumor recurrence.
We have shown that CTGF overexpression in breast cancer cells
elicits an increase in resistance toward doxorubicin and paclitaxel,
as well as the specific up-regulation of Bcl-xL and cIAP1. In view of
its prominent expression in advanced breast cancer tissues as well
as in breast cancer cell lines, coupled with its effect on the
regulation of apoptosis, CTGF is evidently one of the important
determinants of chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer. Hence,
CTGF may be a novel predictive marker for chemosensitivity and a
potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
