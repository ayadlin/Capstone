BACKGROUND: Hemangiopericytomas and malignant solitary fibrous tumors (HPC/SFT) are rare, closely related
sarcomas with unpredictable behavior that respond infrequently to chemotherapy. An optimal systemic treatment
strategy for advanced HPC/SFT has not yet been identified. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of
14 patients with histopathologically confirmed HPC/SFT who were treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center between May 2005 and June 2007. All patients were treated with temozolomide 150 mg/m2 orally on
days 1-7 and days 15-21 and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously on days 8 and 22, repeated at 28-day intervals.
Computed tomography assessment of tumor size and density (Choi criteria) was used to determine the best
response to therapy. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate progression-free survival. RESULTS: The median
follow-up period was 34 months. Eleven patients (79%) achieved a Choi partial response, with a median time to
response of 2.5 months. Two patients (14%) had stable disease as the best response, and 1 patient (7%) had Choi
progressive disease as the best response. The estimated median progression-free survival was 9.7 months,
with a 6-month progression-free rate of 78.6%. The most frequently observed toxic effect was myelosuppression.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab is a generally well-tolerated and clinically
beneficial regimen for HPC/SFT patients. Additional investigation in a controlled, prospective trial is warranted.

Hemangiopericytomas and solitary fibrous tumors (HPC/SFT) are closely related soft tissue sarcomas that
appear to exhibit fibroblastic-type differentiation1,2 and typically affect adults aged 20-70 years. Common sites of involvement include the lower extremities, retroperitoneum/pelvis, lung/pleura, and meninges, but these tumors may be found at
virtually any body site.3-5 Histological features that suggest aggressive behavior are not well defined in HPC/SFT. Surgery
is typically the treatment of choice for localized disease, with reported 10-year overall survival rates of 54%-89% after
complete surgical resection.6-8
For the approximately 20% of HPC/SFT patients who eventually develop local recurrences and/or distant metastases, additional resections should be considered but are not always feasible.6-9 Options for effectively treating unresectable

tumors are limited. Radiotherapy can be used only in
select cases, and to date, responses to systemic chemotherapy have been infrequent.10-15 Alternative therapeutic
options are therefore needed for improved palliation and
disease control.
Temozolomide is an oral cytotoxic alkylating agent
whose active metabolite, monomethyltriazenoimidazole
carboxamide, is identical to that of dacarbazine, a drug
with known antitumor activity against soft tissue sarcomas.16,17 Bevacizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), a key mediator of a signaling pathway that
affects many vital cellular processes, including angiogenesis and vascular permeability.18 Bevacizumab has shown
antitumor activity when combined with a number of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such that its use in combination therapy has been approved for the treatment of
metastatic colorectal, non–small cell lung, and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
breast cancers.19-21 The antitumor activity of temozolomide combined with bevacizumab is currently being studied in several phase 2 and 3 trials for glioblastoma and
metastatic melanoma.22
In May 2005, a patient with a recurrent meningeal
HPC that was refractory to multiple surgical resections,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy was empirically treated
with temozolomide and bevacizumab at our institution.
He subsequently achieved a radiologically evident reduction in tumor size as well as palliation of tumor-related
symptoms. This anecdotal evidence led us to treat 13 subsequently consecutive patients with locally advanced,
recurrent, or metastatic HPC/SFT with temozolomide
plus bevacizumab. Here we describe the responses and
adverse effects of this therapeutic regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all
patients with histological diagnoses of HPC or SFT
treated with temozolomide/bevacizumab combination
therapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center between May 2005 and June 2007. Patients were
identified through the institutional electronic medical
records database. Patients for whom radiological scans
were unavailable for radiological response assessment were
excluded from the analysis. We collected data on patient
characteristics, including age, sex, and ethnicity; disease
characteristics, including primary tumor site and extent of

4940

disease; previous treatment and responses; toxic effects of
temzolomide and bevacizumab; and survival. This study
was approved by our institutional review board.
Treatment
All patients received temozolomide 150 mg/m2 orally on
days 1-7 and days 15-21 and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously on day 8 and day 22 on a 28-day cycle. The median number of cycles given was 7.5 (range, 2.5-27). Four
patients required temozolomide dose modifications or
treatment delay because of neutropenia (n ¼ 1) or thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 3), and 1 of these patients received granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor support.
Radiological Assessment
Baseline radiological studies had been performed up to
4 weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy, and follow-up scans had been performed every 8-12 weeks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging was used at the discretion of the treating physician. Radiological tumor response was determined as described below.
The longest cross-sectional dimension for each
measurable lesion was measured at the beginning of therapy and on each follow-up study. The sum of the longest
selected measurable lesions at each timepoint was computed for each patient. Radiological response was then
determined by calculating the absolute and percentage
change from the baseline sum.
In patients whose responses were assessed via contrast-enhanced CT examination, the tumor density of
each was measured in Hounsfield units by drawing a
region of interest around the margin of the entire lesion.
In patients who underwent CT examination with triphasic techniques, tumor density was measured on scans
obtained in the portal venous phase. The mean baseline
tumor density was compared with the mean tumor density on the subsequent studies.
Response Assessment
Using Choi response criteria,23,24 a complete response
(CR) was defined as the disappearance of all lesions without the appearance of new lesions. Choi partial response
(PR) was defined as a 10% decrease in the sum of the
target lesions or a 15% decrease in tumor density in the
absence of new lesions or obvious progression of nonmeasurable disease. Choi progressive disease (PD) was defined
as a 10% increase in tumor size in the absence of favorable tumor density change required to achieve Choi PR.

Patients whose disease did not meet the criteria for Choi
CR, PR, or PD and who did not have tumor-related
symptomatic deterioration were classified as having stable
disease (SD). Only the best response for each patient was
used in determining response rates. Response was also
assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST)25 to compare with Choi responses.
Pathological Review
All tumor specimens had been reviewed by an MD Anderson sarcoma pathologist who established the diagnosis of
HPC or SFT at the time of each patient’s initial presentation at our institution. For the purpose of this study, 2
experienced sarcoma pathologists (A.J.L. and W.L.W.),
who were blinded to each patient’s outcome, re-reviewed
all available specimens to confirm the diagnoses. Histopathological variables (size, number of mitoses, cellularity,
pleomorphism, and presence of necrosis and/or hemorrhage) were noted during the re-review whenever possible.
Tumors were subcategorized as typical, malignant (based
on hypercellularity, mitotic activity of >4 per 10 highpower fields, moderate to severe cytological atypia, tumor
necrosis and/or distinctly infiltrative margins), or uncertain/unknown and classified according to the 2002 World
Health Organization disease classification criteria for sarcomas.26 The criteria for malignancy in hemangiopericytoma are less well defined than for solitary fibrous tumor,
so these same criteria were used for hemangiopericytoma.
Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized using medians
and ranges for continuous variables and frequencies and
percentages for categorical variables. The response rates
and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated
from variance estimates. The Fisher exact test was used to
assess the association between patient or tumor characteristics and best response. Time to best radiological response
was calculated from the initiation of temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy to the development of Choi CR or Choi
PR. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
interval between the beginning of temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy and radiological evidence of PD, as
defined by either the Choi response criteria or RECIST,
or death from any cause. Survival data were updated on
October 15, 2009, and the patients’ data were censored at
that point. The Kaplan–Meier method27 was used to estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS). All statistical analyses were performed with S-plus 8.0 (TIBCO Software
Inc., Somerville, MA).

RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics
Sixteen patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
HPC/SFT who received temozolomide/bevacizumab
therapy between May 2005 and June 2007 were identified. Two patients for whom radiological scans were
unavailable were excluded from the analysis. The characteristics of the remaining 14 patients are summarized in
Table 1. All 14 patients (9 men, 5 women) were white,
and the median age was 59 years (range, 44-75 years). Ten
patients (71%) had HPC and 4 patients (29%) had SFT.
The most common site of primary disease was the
meninges (n ¼ 6). Seven patients had metastatic disease
when they began temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy,
whereas the remaining patients had either primary or
locally recurrent disease deemed surgically unresectable.
The majority of patients (86%) had received prior
therapy before beginning treatment with temozolomide/
bevacizumab (Table 1). Five patients had received prior
systemic therapy (Table 2). Their best responses to each
prior regimen were reassessed using the Choi criteria.
They had often achieved SD and improvement in their
symptoms with the previous regimens, but none had
achieved Choi PR. The main reasons for beginning temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy included symptomatic
disease, neoadjuvant treatment to potentially downstage
the tumor and enable surgical resection, and disease progression after prior therapy.
At the time of our analysis, all patients had discontinued therapy. Reasons for discontinuing therapy
included disease progression (n ¼ 6); intolerable side
effects such as thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 2), fungal infection
(n ¼ 1), and decreased performance status (n ¼ 1);
patient’s preference to discontinue therapy (n ¼ 1); physician’s decision to withdraw therapy after the patient
achieved maximum clinical benefit (n ¼ 2); and death
due to PD (n ¼ 1).

Clinical Outcome
The overall response rate was 79% (11 patients; 95% CI,
49.2-95.3). All 11 patients who responded had Choi PR
(Table 3; Fig. 1). Two patients (14%) achieved Choi SD,
and Choi PD was the best response in 1 patient (7%).
Response was observed as a decrease in size (n ¼ 1),
density (n ¼ 3), or both (n ¼ 7). Ten (71%) patients
demonstrated some degree of tumor shrinkage; their median tumor size change was 10.1% (range, 56.2%15.5%). Ten patients (71%) demonstrated at least a 15%

reduction in tumor density, and the median percent
change in density was 26.2% (range, 67.6%-5.4%).
For the patients who demonstrated a Choi PR, response
was seen early during treatment, with all patients achieving PR after 2-4 cycles; the median time to response was
2.5 months (range, 1.6-4.7 months). Of the 7 patients
who had symptomatic disease at the beginning of therapy,

4942

6 achieved Choi PRs, which were seen with improvements
in their symptoms.
The overall response rate was also calculated using
RECIST. Two (14%) patients achieved a RECIST PR
(95% CI, 1.8%-42.8%). The remaining 12 patients all
achieved RECIST SD, with 11 (79%) patients demonstrating RECIST SD for more than 4 months (95% CI,
49.2%-95.3%). No statistically significant associations
were found between response and any patient or tumor
characteristics, including primary tumor location (meningeal vs nonmeningeal) and primary tumor histological
classification (benign vs malignant vs unknown).
At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 34
months. The median Choi PFS was 9.67 months (95%
CI, 7.31-not estimable), and the proportion of patients
who were progression-free at 6 months was 78.6%
(Fig. 2). The median RECIST PFS was 10.8 months
(95% CI, 8.13-not estimable) (Fig. 3), and the 6-month
PFS was 92.9%. To date, 5 patients are alive, and 4
(28.6%) of them remain progression-free. Ten (71.4%)
patients ultimately had PD or had died. The median overall survival was estimated at 24.3 months.
Toxicity
Treatment was generally well tolerated, but because it was
not administered in a clinical trial setting, toxicity data
were not recorded systematically. The most notable toxic
effect was myelosuppression, with neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia requiring treatment modifications
and/or delays in 4 patients. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea,
and headache were also noted.
One patient developed a pulmonary infiltrate after
20.5 cycles of temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy, at
which point therapy was withheld. A follow-up chest CT
examination 6 weeks later revealed a persistent lung nodule. A biopsy of the lesion showed inflammation, and the
cultures were positive for Cryptococcus. The patient was
successfully treated with oral fluconazole, and the infection subsequently resolved.
One patient, a 48-year-old woman, died during
treatment. She had a recurrent HPC tumor adjacent to
the cervical spine and had undergone 3 previous operations as well as radiation therapy. On day 11 of cycle 4 of
temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy, she was admitted to
the hospital with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia secondary to infected hardware in her cervical spine. She was
treated with intravenous antibiotics, and the bacteremia
resolved. She received 2 additional cycles of treatment but
was admitted again on day 7 of cycle 6 with renal failure,

DISCUSSION
In patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
HPC/SFT who were treated with temozolomide and bevacizumab, reductions in tumor size and/or density consistent with PRs as assessed by Choi criteria were evident in
most patients. Several patients also demonstrated long
periods of freedom from disease progression, with 5

patients having a time-to-progression period of 20
months.
Currently, the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide is the standard systemic chemotherapy regimen
for many subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma. Gemcitabine
combined with docetaxel has also emerged as a good therapeutic choice for these patients. Although cases of HPC/
SFT responding to these chemotherapeutic agents have
been reported sporadically,6,10-13,15 no systematic review
or clinical trial to date has identified an effective systemic
regimen for unresectable HPC/SFT.

44.0 Hounsfield units.

Because of a lack of good historical data regarding
response rates and disease PFS with which we can readily
compare our current findings, we turned to our existing
patients’ experiences with systemic chemotherapy. A review
of our HPC/SFT patients’ prior regimens showed that doxorubicin, gemcitabine/docetaxel, and paclitaxel did not produce a RECIST radiological response in any of the 5
patients. We then retrospectively reassessed their responses
using the Choi criteria and concluded that none of the
patients had achieved a Choi PR to prior therapy, but all 5
had a PR to temozolomide and bevacizumab. To further
understand the activity of temozolomide and bevacizumab
compared with standard chemotherapy regimens, we previously reported on a separate cohort of 5 advanced HPC/
SFT patients who had received doxorubicin and ifosfamide,
single-agent ifosfamide, or gemcitabine and docetaxel at our
institution.14 Reassessment of their radiological scans using

4944

the Choi criteria showed that only 1 of 5 patients demonstrated a Choi PR, with a median PFS of 6.1 months (range,
1.6-9 months), further suggesting that standard chemotherapy regimens may only have limited efficacy in HPC/SFT.
The overall Choi response rate of 79% with temozolomide and bevacizumab observed in this retrospective
review, therefore, seems to be much more favorable than
that with standard chemotherapy regimens. Our study has
the typical limitations of a retrospective analysis, including
the possibilities of patient selection bias and observer bias,
a small sample size, and the lack of a systematic, comprehensive recording of toxic effects. Nevertheless, the degree
of Choi radiological responses and the duration of PFS
observed in our patients appear superior to those observed
in historical studies with chemotherapy regimens.
The current evidenced-based method for response
evaluation for soft tissue sarcomas is RECIST. However,

several studies have demonstrated that RECIST may be
insensitive for evaluating response in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated with imatinib, and the Choi criteria have recently emerged as a
more sensitive tool for assessing the degree of tumor necrosis in response to therapy in that setting.23,24 Soft tissue sarcomas other than GIST, treated with cytotoxic or
biological therapies, display patterns of response similar
to those of GISTs treated with imatinib, with patients
exhibiting long time-to-progression periods despite a
lack of significant reduction in their tumor size.28,29 In
fact, many investigators who use RECIST to evaluate
soft tissue sarcomas do not use response as an endpoint
but only time to progression. Therefore, we chose to
assess the activity of temozolomide and bevacizumab in
HPC/SFT with the Choi criteria as well as RECIST. We
believe that the Choi criteria allow us to detect
response—or lack thereof—early in the course of treatment and thereby quickly identify potential nonresponders who may benefit from switching to another therapy.
In addition, because the Choi criteria for PD are more
stringent than RECIST (10% increase in tumor size),
failure of therapy may also be detected earlier. This earlier detection explains the shorter median PFS we found
when using the Choi criteria than when using RECIST.
Although toxicity data were not systematically gathered, all available clinic notes and laboratory values were
thoroughly reviewed to capture as many adverse effects as
possible. The majority of the patients did not exhibit
significant complications while receiving treatment as
scheduled. We did not note any serious adverse effects
(eg, thromboembolic events, cardiac toxicity, or gastroin-

testinal bleeding) associated with bevacizumab. Although
1 patient died during treatment, we found no definitive
evidence that temozolomide and/or bevacizumab directly
contributed to the immediate factors that resulted in her
death. Rather, the patient’s treating physician (R.S.B.)
believed that her overall poor performance status most
likely led to her death.
Our patients received a wide range of number of
doses of therapy. Most patients received treatment until
PD or intolerable adverse effects developed, but a few
patients were empirically given treatment breaks because
of patient or physician preferences. It is difficult to conclude, based on the sample size, how long temozolomide/
bevacizumab therapy should be continued or whether it
could be interrupted and resumed without significantly
reducing the therapeutic benefit. The optimal dosage and
schedule of temozolomide and bevacizumab in HPC/SFT
are yet to be defined. Currently, both temozolomide and
bevacizumab are used in several different dosages and
schedules for other malignancies, with no one clearly proven strategy. We chose our particular regimen based on
anecdotal experience from our first patient. A prospective
study to address these questions and to establish the optimal temzolomide/bevacizumab therapy’s safety and efficacy is currently under development.
Also unclear is the potential additional benefit of
radiation therapy. Three patients with isolated sites of disease had received radiation therapy within 4 months
before or after temozolomide/bevacizumab treatment. All
had achieved Choi PR with their first treatment modality.
Two patients were still responding when they initiated
their second treatment modality, and 1 patient was exhibiting tumor regrowth. Despite having discontinued their

last treatment 18-23 months before the time of our analysis, all 3 patients to date continue to show a long, durable
maintenance of their responses, with PFS of 34-43
months. Further information regarding the potential synergistic effect of temozolomide/bevacizumab therapy and
radiation is needed to confirm this encouraging finding.
As we stated earlier, the rationale for temozolomide/
bevacizumab was empirical, as this combination therapy
has not been used in soft tissue sarcoma. We do not know
whether the success of this regimen is due to temozolomide, bevaziumab, or their synergistic effect. Bevacizumab
may enhance temozolomide’s cytotoxic activity or may
play an antiangiogenic role by modulating the VEGF signaling pathway. The VEGF–VEGF receptor pathway,
which plays a key mediator role in angiogenesis, has
recently emerged as a potential key therapeutic target in
HPC/SFT. The anti-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib have also demonstrated evidence of activity in HPC/SFT.30-32 Patients treated with
sunitinib have also demonstrated Choi responses lasting
>6 months, similar to patients described in our report.33
Anecdotal experiences with sorafenib in HPC/SFT patients
have demonstrated Choi responses and disease stabilization
for up to 22 months.30,32 It is not yet clear whether these
anti-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors will be just
as effective as temozolomide/bevacizumab in HPC/SFT,
but the initial results are encouraging. Further studies are
required to better elucidate the key therapeutic targets in
HPC/SFT. Analysis of our patients’ available tumor specimens for potential molecular correlative factors is ongoing.
To our knowledge, our report represents the largest
published series of patients with advanced HPC/SFT
treated with a single systemic regimen to date. We found
that the combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab
had a remarkably high rate of Choi overall response and a
favorable duration of disease control. For these rare sarcoma subtypes that lack a well-established systemic therapeutic option, temozolomide/bevacizumab is a promising
therapeutic regimen that warrants further investigation.
Our results should be validated in a prospective trial,
which would also allow additional insight into the efficacy, safety, and biological mechanisms of temozolomide
and bevacizumab in HPC/SFT.
