BACKGROUND: The Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib (ARCCS) program made sorafenib available to
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) before regulatory approval. METHODS: In this nonrandomized,
open-label expanded access program, 2504 patients from the United States and Canada were treated with oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Safety and efficacy were explored overall and in subgroups of patients including those
with no prior therapy, nonclear cell (nonclear cell) RCC, brain metastases, prior bevacizumab treatment, and elderly
patients. Sorafenib was approved for RCC 6 months after study initiation, at which time patients with no prior therapy or with nonclear cell RCC could enroll in an extension protocol for continued assessment for a period of 6
months. RESULTS: The most common grade 2 drug-related adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (18%), rash
(14%), hypertension (12%), and fatigue (11%). In the 1891 patients evaluable for response, complete response was
observed in 1 patient, partial response in 67 patients (4%), and stable disease for at least 8 weeks in 1511 patients
(80%). Median progression-free survival in the extension population was 36 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 3345 weeks; censorship rate, 56%); median overall survival in the entire population was 50 weeks (95% CI, 46-52 weeks;
censorship rate, 63%). The efficacy and safety results were similar across the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib
400 mg twice daily demonstrated activity and a clinically acceptable toxicity profile in all patient subsets enrolled in

KEYWORDS: sorafenib, expanded access program, renal cell carcinoma, progression-free survival, bevacizumab,
brain metastases, first-line, nonclear cell.

In 2008, 54,390 new cases of cancer of the kidney or renal pelvis were estimated to be diagnosed in the United
States, with approximately 90% classified as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and 13,010 patients were estimated to die
of the disease.1,2 The traditional 5-year survival rate for
patients with metastatic RCC is estimated to be <10%.2,3
At the time of diagnosis, 20% to 30% of RCC patients
have metastatic disease, which is generally resistant to
classic chemotherapy and radiation therapy.4 Before the
introduction of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) pathway- and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR)-targeted therapy, recombinant human interleukin-2 and recombinant human interferon alpha2b (IFNa2b) either alone or in combination were the standard
treatments.5 However, these agents have limited efficacy
and are associated with significant toxicity.6-12
Recognition of the essential role of VEGF in RCC
pathogenesis led to the testing of angiogenesis inhibitors
in this disease.13 Sorafenib is a potent multikinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases VEGF receptors 1, 2, and
3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptors a and b, as
well as the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf
kinase.14 In xenograft models, sorafenib administered as a
single agent had potent antiangiogenic activity and was
found to inhibit the growth of RCC tumors.15,16
Sorafenib was investigated as monotherapy in 4
phase 1 trials17-20 and had an acceptable toxicity profile.
In a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial, sorafenib
prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
placebo in patients with metastatic RCC in whom previous treatment was ineffective.21 These positive results
were subsequently confirmed in a large phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Treatment Approaches in
Renal Cancer Global Evaluation Trial [TARGET]) of
sorafenib in 903 previously treated cytokine-refractory
patients with metastatic RCC.22 Sorafenib therapy
reduced the risk of disease progression by 56%; the median PFS with sorafenib (5.5 months) was twice that with
placebo (2.8 months; P < .001).
The positive results in the TARGET trial substantiated the need to assess the use of sorafenib in patients who
might benefit while it was under review by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and not commercially
available. The Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib
Cancer

March 1, 2010

(ARCCS) expanded access program was therefore instituted in North America to make sorafenib available to
patients with advanced RCC who had no access to or did
not qualify for other sorafenib clinical trials. We report
here the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in this large group
of patients representative of those with advanced RCC in
the community setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients were 15 years old, had histologically
confirmed advanced RCC, and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, with waivers granted to selected patients with performance status
3 or 4. Unlike previous controlled clinical trials, this
expanded access program included patients with nonclear
cell pathology, patients with active or progressive metastatic brain disease despite previous treatment, those who
had not received prior drug therapy for advanced RCC,
and patients who had received therapy with bevacizumab
at least 28 days before enrolling in this study (provided
they had no grade 3 hemorrhagic episode during therapy, and no history of grade 2 hemorrhagic event within
6 months of bevacizumab therapy). Patients were
excluded if they had treatment with other investigational
drugs in the 4 weeks before enrollment, cardiac arrhythmias, active coronary artery disease or ischemia, uncontrolled hypertension, renal impairment requiring dialysis,
recent or active bleeding diathesis, or life expectancy <2
months.
All patients provided written informed consent. The
study was approved by the institutional review board at
each center and complied with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines,
and local laws and regulations.
Study Design
This nonrandomized, open-label expanded access program was conducted at 319 centers in the United States
and at 8 centers in Canada (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT00111020). Enrollment in the United States started
in June 2005 and ended in December 2005 when the
FDA approved the use of sorafenib for the treatment of

1273

Original Article

advanced RCC, and it became commercially available. In
Canada, enrollment took place between June 2005 and
July 2006. Patients received oral sorafenib 400 mg twice
daily on a continuous basis. Sorafenib tablets were supplied by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals (West Haven,
Conn). Therapy was discontinued if the patient developed
unacceptable toxicity, if progression of disease occurred,
or if, in the investigator’s judgment, the patient was
unlikely to benefit from further treatment with sorafenib.
Toxicity-related dose modifications of sorafenib were performed in accordance with protocol-specified guidelines.
Because there was no central pathologic review and
the original case report forms included the choice ‘‘other’’
rather than ‘unclassified,’’ 1 member of the steering committee reviewed pathology reports from a total of 226
patients (162 other, 11 no subtype recorded, 50 nonclear
cell, 3 clear cell). Among the nonclear cell reports
reviewed, histologic coding was changed in 25, typically
to unclassified (22 cases). Patients with ‘‘unclassified’’ histology or those coded as ‘‘other’’ in whom the pathology
report could not be reviewed were not included in the
nonclear cell category for analysis.
Initial study phase

A baseline radiologic assessment of tumor burden
was completed within 28 days before enrollment. Radiologic and/or clinical assessment of the target tumor was
repeated at 8-week intervals or in accordance with the
local standard of care. Clinical assessments were used only
if radiologic assessments were not available. There was no
validation of the investigator’s assessment of disease progression by an independent radiologist or oncologist.
When the expanded access program was discontinued, the
protocol specified follow-up for overall survival (OS) every 3 months; however, compliance with this requirement
was poor and, at the time of final data analysis, the median
follow-up time was only 22.4 weeks. Patients who
remained on sorafenib therapy when the program ended
were switched to commercial product or enrolled into the
extension phase.
Six-month extension phase

When the expanded access program ended in the
United States with FDA approval of sorafenib, patients
who had not received prior antineoplastic therapy for
advanced RCC and/or who were diagnosed with nonclear
cell RCC were eligible to enter a 6-month extension
study. During the 6-month extension, visit procedures
and reporting were the same as during the initial study

1274

phase. Tumor assessments and radiologic evaluations
were performed every 8 weeks, as described. At the conclusion of the extension phase, patients were observed
every 3 months for OS.
Safety and Efficacy Assessments
Assessment of adverse events was based on clinical and
laboratory evaluations considered as standard of care, and
any reported adverse events were graded with version 3.0
of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events. The best overall response rate
was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.23 In this study, PFS was
defined as the time from administration of the first dose
of sorafenib to disease progression or death. OS was
defined as the time from administration of the first dose
of sorafenib to death and was calculated for all patients 18
months after FDA approval of sorafenib. Kaplan-Meier
analyses were performed for PFS and OS.
Safety and efficacy data were evaluated separately for
2 prespecified patient groups: first-line patients with no
prior antineoplastic therapy for advanced RCC and those
who received prior therapy. In addition, post hoc analyses
of safety and efficacy were completed for subgroups of
patients who are typically not enrolled in sorafenib clinical
trials: patients with nonclear cell RCC, brain metastases,
or prior bevacizumab treatment, and patients 70 years
of age.

RESULTS
Between June 2005 and July 2006, 2515 patients with
advanced RCC were enrolled in the ARCCS program in
North America; 2504 patients (2298 in the United States
and 206 in Canada) received at least 1 dose of sorafenib
and were included in safety and efficacy analyses. Of these
patients, 328 participated in the extension phase of the
program. Demographic and disease characteristics in firstline patients were similar to those with prior therapy (Table 1). Among patients with brain metastasis, 36 had no
prior treatment for advanced RCC, and 34 had prior
treatment. Patient disposition is shown in Figure 1.
The median duration of sorafenib treatment was 12
weeks (range, <1-81 weeks); the median average daily
dose was 758 mg. Dose reductions occurred in 869 (35%)
patients and interruptions in 1515 (61%) patients, primarily because of adverse events (88% and 79%, respectively). The most common adverse events leading to dose
reduction were hand-foot skin reaction (n ¼ 218, 8.7%),

occurred in <1% of the overall population and were not
reported in the brain metastases subpopulation. Seizures
occurred in 7% of patients with brain metastases and in
1% of the total population; none was attributed to sorafenib therapy. There were 189 (8%) on-study deaths. Incidence was similar across subgroups (range, 6%-8%),
except in patients with brain metastases (17%). The most
common nonfatal serious adverse events reported in all
patients were dyspnea (3%) and dehydration (3%).
Overall best response per RECIST guidelines was
available in 1891 (76%) patients (Table 3). The median
PFS in the overall population was 24 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 22-25; censorship rate, 46%); it was
similar among first-line and previously treated populations (Fig. 2, Top). For comparison with other clinical trials that typically exclude patients with nonclear cell RCC,
PFS was also calculated without data from patients with
nonclear cell RCC (n ¼ 202). Results were similar to that
in the overall population with a median of 24 weeks (95%
CI, 22-25; censorship rate, 46%).
Of the 328 patients enrolled in the extension protocol, 246 patients had data available for analysis of progression; the median PFS in these patients was 36 weeks (95%
CI, 33-45; censorship rate, 56%). In the first-line patients
from the extension population (n ¼ 220), the median
PFS was 36 weeks (95% CI, 33-45; censorship rate,
58%). In the previously treated nonclear cell extension
patients (n ¼ 26), the median PFS was 46 weeks (95%
CI, 30-59; censorship rate, 38%) (Fig. 2, Bottom). The
median OS in the entire population was 50 weeks (95%
CI, 46-52; censorship rate, 63%); similar results were

DISCUSSION
The phase 3 TARGET trial established the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with advanced RCC22; the
ARCCS expanded access program broadened the experience with sorafenib in this patient population. As the
ARCCS program was conducted in hospitals and community practice centers in addition to academic sites and
because inclusion criteria were more liberal than for clinical trials, the ARCCS program enrolled a large number of
patients who were more representative of the general metastatic RCC population than those in the typical RCC
clinical trial.
Sorafenib treatment in the ARCCS program demonstrated a clinically manageable safety profile, with types
and severity of adverse events similar to those in the phase
3 TARGET trial. The most common adverse events in
both TARGET and ARCCS were hand-foot skin reaction, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. The severity of
these adverse events was usually low to moderate grade.
Incidence and severity of adverse events in different subgroups of patients (first-line patients, previously treated
patients, patients with nonclear cell RCC, brain metastases, previous treatment with bevacizumab, and patients
70 years of age) were also similar to those in the overall
ARCCS population.
Hypertension as a serious adverse event was reported
in TARGET as well as other clinical trials with sorafenib.22,24 In ARCCS, grade 3 drug-related hypertension
was reported in only 5% of patients. However, other studies indicate that the incidence of sorafenib-induced blood
pressure elevation is on the order of 75%,25 and a metaanalysis suggests that the overall incidence of hypertension
is about 23%.24
The ARCCS study also suggests that the tolerability
profile of sorafenib is not worse in patients with previously
treated active or progressive brain disease, although baseline data regarding the extent of brain disease and prior
treatment were limited. Overall, the higher rate of seizures
in those with brain metastases was not attributed to sorafenib, and there were no cerebral bleeding events reported
in this subgroup. In the ARCCS program, 736 (29%)
patients were 70 years of age, reflective of the age
distribution of patients with advanced RCC. As with the
overall ARCCS population, the adverse events were
predictable and manageable in elderly patients.

the
and

The TARGET trial demonstrated that sorafenib
therapy improved PFS 2-fold versus placebo in patients
with RCC refractory to prior cytokine therapy.22 In a disease state for which the mortality rate is high and median
survival is only 13 months,26 this delay in disease progression is notable. In trials with other VEGF inhibitors in
patients with advanced RCC regardless of prior therapy
status, median PFS ranged from 4 months to 11 months.2
In the ARCCS program, median PFS of 6 months in the
entire population and 9 months in patients in the 6month extension phase is consistent with previous

findings. The OS of 12 months observed in the ARCCS
program was lower than that in the TARGET study (19
months); however, the patient population was less selective in the former. Furthermore, efficacy results from the
ARCCS program are not directly comparable to those
from randomized, controlled trials because of inherent
limitations in study design and methods of an expanded
access program. First, data collection and monitoring
were not as rigorous as for a controlled clinical trial. A key
limitation was that investigator assessments were not validated by an independent, centralized reviewer. In addition, radiologic assessments were preferred but not always
obtained; in such cases, clinical assessments of tumor
response were used. Perhaps most importantly, FDA approval of sorafenib for treatment of advanced RCC terminated the expanded access program. This limited the
duration of on-study therapy (median, 12 weeks) and precision in the estimate of PFS because of the high rate of
censorship (46%-73% of this was because of switching to
commercial drug). In a large proportion of cases, confirmatory radiologic assessments of a partial response could
not be performed on study.
The extension phase was added as a protocol amendment to allow for longer treatment and follow-up of
patients who had not received prior therapy and those
with nonclear cell RCC, thus providing additional information about efficacy of sorafenib in these patient types.
However, the censorship rate in the extension subset was
also quite high (56%-91% of this was because of switching to commercial drug). Nonetheless, within the limits
of the program design, these results suggest that sorafenib
is effective regardless of prior therapy status. Recently,
first-line therapies for advanced RCC with other multikinase inhibitors (sunitinib) and angiogenic inhibitors
(combination of bevacizumab and interferon) were shown
to be more effective than IFN-a alone. There are no direct
comparisons between these treatments and sorafenib.27,28
The majority (80%) of metastatic RCC is clear cell;
therefore, most prior efficacy data, including those
obtained with sorafenib, are from patients with this histologic diagnosis. In fact, in many trials, patients with nonclear cell RCC were excluded. Although the extension
phase of this protocol was designed in part to assess PFS
in patients with nonclear cell disease, the number of
patients with nonclear cell enrolled in the extension population was too small (n ¼ 202) to provide meaningful estimates. Nevertheless, the 127 patients with valid response
data represent the largest experience with this drug in nonclear cell RCC to date. Within the limitations of local

Cancer

pathology evaluation, albeit with central pathology report
review, sorafenib appears to have antitumor activity in
papillary and probably chromophobe cancers.
Finally, emerging data suggest that there is not an
absolute cross-resistance between different VEGF pathway targeting agents. In fact, a previous study demonstrated activity of sorafenib or sunitinib in patients with
advanced RCC with prior therapy with antiangiogenic
agents.29 In ARCCS, 290 patients had prior therapy with
bevacizumab, and their response to sorafenib was similar
to that of other subgroups. Thus, similar to sunitinib, sorafenib has clinical activity after bevacizumab treatment.30
In conclusion, the ARCCS expanded access program provided additional information on sorafenib for
the treatment of advanced RCC in a more representative
patient population, extending the experience with sorafenib beyond the clinical trial setting in patients who had
not been previously examined. This confirms that sorafenib, along with other VEGF and mTOR pathwaydirected agents, is an appropriate addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for this disease. This study does
not address current controversies regarding relative value
or appropriate sequence of the various agents now available. The data generated from the ARCCS program supported results from the TARGET trial and extended the
findings to other subsets of patients who had not been previously examined. The tolerability of sorafenib was similar
to that observed in previous clinical trials, with the majority of adverse events clinically manageable. Furthermore,
these findings were supportive of previous trials demonstrating that sorafenib therapy delays disease progression
in patients with advanced RCC. Additional studies are
currently underway to investigate how best to combine or
sequence sorafenib with other therapeutic agents in a variety of treatment settings.
