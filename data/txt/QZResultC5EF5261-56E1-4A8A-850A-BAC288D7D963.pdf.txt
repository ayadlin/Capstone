BACKGROUND: Over the years, doxorubicin and gemcitabine have been among the most widely used drugs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with relative efficacy. The authors report the results of a phase 2 study of the combination of gemcitabine plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC received
combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8, followed by pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 on Day 1. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks to a maximum of 8 cycles. Primary endpoint was
overall response rate, and secondary endpoints were time to disease progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and
toxicity. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled and were evaluable for response, toxicity, and survival. A total of
194 cycles of treatment were administered. Three (7%) patients had a complete response, and 1 of these patients
underwent liver transplantation. Seven (17%) patients had a partial response and, among these patients, 1 patient
underwent surgical resection. Among the 31 patients who had initial alpha-fetoprotein levels >400 ng/mL, 20
(64.5%) had a >20% decrease after 2 cycles of treatment. The median TTP and OS were 5.8 and 22.5 months, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was the most common side effect, including neutropenia (17%) and anemia (7%).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of gemcitabine plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was active and safe in
advanced HCC. Moreover, this treatment induced some complete responses and converted some untreatable HCCs

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.1 The highest incidence rates are found in East Asia and in the United States; the incidence rates of HCC
tripled between 1975 and 2005.2 The only curative treatments for HCC are surgical resection and liver transplantation;
however, only about 15% of patients are eligible for these treatments, because of the coexistence of the advanced stage of
the disease and cirrhosis at presentation.3 Over the years, numerous cytotoxic agents have been tested with rather disappointing results.4 Underlying cirrhosis, impaired liver function, portal hypertension, and thrombocytopenia make systemic chemotherapy difficult.
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite with demonstrated activity against HCC,5 exhibiting cell phase specificity,
primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Moreover, the favorable nonhematologic toxicity spectrum and the mild
and reversible hematological toxicity profile have made this agent an attractive and ideal drug for combination regimens.
Doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, is another of the most widely used and active agents in HCC, with a
response rate between 0 and 44%,6 although in more recent studies this has not exceeded 25%7; however, its use is limited
by elevated toxicity. In contrast to free doxorubicin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, which avoids uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, has shown longer circulation times, higher tumor selectivity, greater antitumor activity, and reduced

toxicity.8 Neutropenia, stomatitis, and palmoplantar
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) were found to be the major
dose-limiting adverse effects of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Regarding its activity in advanced HCC, various
studies have shown response rates of 10% to 14%,9 with a
favorable toxicity profile.
Since 2008, sorafenib has become the standard firstline treatment for advanced HCC, on the basis of the
results of the SHARP trial; this study showed an increased
median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival
(OS) of about 3 months when compared with placebo10;
despite the significant survival benefit obtained, further
improvement in the treatment of advanced HCC remains
mandatory.
For all these reasons, in particular for the demonstrated single-agent cytotoxic action, the different mechanisms of action, the lack of cross-resistance, and
nonoverlapping toxicity, a phase 2 study was undertaken
to examine the efficacy and safety profiles of a combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. In our study, gemcitabine was
administered before pegylated liposomal doxorubicin,
because various studies11,12 have demonstrated that gemcitabine induces an increase in topoisomerase II expression; thus, a subsequent pegylated liposomal doxorubicinmediated antitopoisomerase effect may cause a more significant cytotoxicity. Moreover, because in a prior phase 2
study13 of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of
50 mg/m2 in refractory ovarian cancer significant skin
toxicities and mucositis were been reported, whereas a
subsequent study14 demonstrated that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 in advanced HCC
had low systemic toxicity, it was decided to use pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 30 mg/m2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
This study was a phase 2, open-label, single-arm, singleinstitution trial. All patients were required to provide
written informed consent before study participation.
Patients were eligible for the study if they met the following criteria: pathologically proven HCC or an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level >400 ng/mL associated with imaging
evidence on computed tomography (CT) scan or nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) of HCC and inoperable or
metastatic HCC. Inoperable disease was defined as either
lesion too large for resection, regional lymph node
involvement, presence of multifocal disease, or invasion of

126

major blood vessels. Other inclusion criteria were as follows: measurable disease according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)15 on CT
or magnetic resonance imaging; no previous systemic
chemotherapy regimens for HCC; age >18 years; Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS) of 0 to 2; compensated Child-Pugh stage A
or B cirrhosis; adequate renal function (creatinine <120
lmol/L), adequate blood cell counts (neutrophil count
>1.5  109/L, platelet count >100  109/L), and
adequate hepatic function (bilirubin 3 mg/dL, alanine
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels up
to 7 the institutional normal limits). Prior allowed treatments included surgery, transarterial chemoembolization,
percutaneous ethanol injection, and radiofrequency ablation. Exclusion criteria included concurrent malignancy,
known central nervous system metastases, significant
medical comorbidities, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, and any evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.

Treatment Protocol
Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 diluted
in 250 mL normal saline infused over 30 minutes on Days
1 and 8, followed by pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30
mg/m2 in 500 mL 5% dextrose intravenously over 1 hour
on Day 1. Each cycle was given every 4 weeks.
The pretreatment evaluation included a medical history, physical examination, serum hepatitis B and C serology, blood chemistry including AFP level, and hepatic
and renal function tests. Required radiologic studies
included chest x-ray, cardiac echocardiogram, abdomen
CT, or NMR imaging scan.
Physical examinations, full blood counts, serum bilirubin, and AFP assay were recorded before the beginning
of each cycle; CT or NMR imaging scans were performed
every 3 cycles. Follow-up evaluations included physical
examination, blood chemistry, and CT or NMR imaging
scans every 2 months. Response and progression were
evaluated using the RECIST system.15 Treatment was
continued until disease progression, chemotherapy delay
for >3 weeks, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, or
completion of 8 courses of therapy. Salvage chemotherapy
was allowed for patients who were refractory to this treatment and was left to the discretion of the investigators.
Premedication included ranitidine 150 mg, hydrocortisone 125 mg, chlorphenamine 10 mg, and ondansetron 4 mg. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not
recommended for prophylaxis of neutropenia.

Toxicity Evaluation and Dose Modification
All patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment were
considered evaluable for safety. Toxicity was evaluated
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria version 2.
On Day 1, the patient was required to have an absolute neutrophil count 1500 and platelets 100,000 to
receive treatment. The dose of gemcitabine was reduced
by 50% in case of grade 1 thrombocytopenia or grade 2
neutropenia; it was discontinued if patients developed
higher toxicity. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was
reduced by 25% or discontinued in case of grade 2 PPE.
Treatment of common adverse effects seen with this
regimen, such as anorexia, nausea, and emesis, was
allowed using standard interventions.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was the overall response rate. Sample size was calculated to reject a 10% response rate in
favor of a target response rate of 30%, with a significance
level of .05 and a power of 80% by using Simon 2-stage
design.16 In the initial stage, a total of 12 assessable
patients were evaluated for response. If >1 response was
observed, then 20 additional patients were selected to
enter the second stage to achieve a sample size of at least
32 evaluable patients.
Secondary objectives included TTP, OS, safety, and
identification of the factors that influence TTP and OS
with this regimen. Follow-up was calculated from the outset of treatment.
TTP was calculated from the start of therapy until
tumor progression or death. OS was calculated from the
start of therapy to the date of death. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate survival. The analyses were
performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
Independent prognosticators for TTP and OS were
studied by forward stepwise approach in Cox regression
analyses. Variables with a P value <.25 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression. P values
were based on 2-sided testing, and statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS 15 statistical software (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill). Differences with a P.05 were considered
significant.

Patient and disease characteristics are shown in Table 1.
There were 33 (80.5%) men and 8 (19.5%) women. The
median age was 63.2 years (range, 44-78.1 years); the median ECOG PS was 1 (range, 0-2); 19 (46.3%) patients

line treatment, this was left to the discretion of the investigators; most patients were treated with oral capecitabine
or intravenous 5-fluorouracil.
Figure 1. The median time to disease progression was 5.8
months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-8.9 months).

Clinical Efficacy
Overall, 194 cycles of treatment were administered; the
median number of courses of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin plus gemcitabine was 4 (range, 1-8). At the time of
analysis, 20 patients were still involved in the study. Median follow-up time was 8.2 months (range, 1.7-52.8
months). In the 20 patients who were still alive, the median follow-up time was 22.5 months (range, 2.3-52.8
months).
The primary study endpoint was objective response
(Table 2). All patients were evaluable for response. Three
(7.3%) patients had a complete response (CR) and, in
particular, complete pathologic remission by chemotherapy alone was documented in 1 patient in the specimen
who underwent resection. Moreover, 1 of these patients
underwent liver transplantation after the response to
chemotherapy; to date he is still alive (52.8 months from
the start of systemic treatment).
Seven (17.1%) patients had a partial response (PR)
and, among these patients, 1 patient underwent surgical
resection; in this case the TTP was 18.9 months.
Of 31 patients who had an elevated AFP level
(>400 ng/mL) at baseline, a decrease in AFP of >20% after 2 cycles of treatment was observed in 20 (64.5%)
patients.
The overall response rate (CR þ PR) was 24.4%.
The disease control rate (CR þ PR þ stable disease [SD])
was 58.5%. However, 17 (41.5%) patients had disease
progression.
The median TTP of the entire population was 5.8
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-8.9 months)
(Fig. 1) and the median OS was 22.5 months (95% CI,
4.6-40.3 months) (Fig. 2).

Toxicity
All patients were assessable for toxicity. Adverse events
related to the study drugs are listed in Table 3. The combination of gemcitabine plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin was generally well tolerated, and no treatmentrelated death occurred; moreover, there was no significant
difference in tolerance to chemotherapy between patients
with Child-Pugh stage A and B. Thirteen grade 3-4
adverse events were observed. Hematologic toxicity was
the most common severe toxicity and consisted of neutropenia (17%), anemia (7%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).
Nonhematologic grade 3-4 toxicity consisted of nausea/
vomiting in (2%) 1 patient and stomatitis in 1 (2%)
patient. Only 3 (7%) grade 1-2 hand-foot syndromes

Predictive Factors
The results of univariate and multivariate analyses, carried
out to identify factors predicting TTP and OS, are given
in Table 4 and Table 5.
ECOG PS (P ¼ .04) and Okuda staging (P<.001)
were found to be independent predictors for TTP on multivariate analysis.
Multivariate analysis indicates that OS was significantly longer in patients with good PS (P <.001), earlier
disease stage (P ¼ .002) and lower AFP (<400 ng/mL)
levels (P ¼ .02).
Among the 31 patients with elevated serum AFP
(>400 ng/mL) before treatment, a decrease in AFP of
>20% after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was an independent
favorable predictor for TTP (P<.001) and OS (P ¼ .02)
(Table 6).

DISCUSSION
HCC has been considered to be a chemotherapy-resistant
tumor, and until recently there were no effective treatments that significantly increased survival in prospective
randomized trials.17 The median survival of such patients
was from 6 to 8 months.
Only with the advent of sorafenib was a significant
increase in survival obtained; a randomized, prospective,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (SHARP)
in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A dem-

130

onstrated a significant survival benefit for sorafenib.10 In
this study, median OS and median TTP were prolonged
by nearly 3 months in the sorafenib group compared with
the placebo group; median OS was 10.7 months versus
7.9 months (P<.001), and median TTP was 5.5 months
versus 2.8 months (P<.001). Although sorafenib was
shown to be effective, no patient had a CR, only 2% had a
PR, and 71% had SD according to RECIST criteria.
Recently, despite its effect on survival and TTP, in a draft
guidance the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence suggested that sorafenib would not be a costeffective first-line drug to treat advanced HCC.18 Also,
the drug is indicated for treatment only in patients with
preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A), at least in Italy.
Before the evidence of efficacy of sorafenib become
available, conventional doxorubicin was among the most
used and active agents in advanced HCC, with a response
rate of approximately 25%.7 In a randomized study,6 free
doxorubicin has been shown to be superior to palliative
treatment of HCC, although a subsequent meta-analysis
showed no efficacy of the drug in terms of survival.17
Conversely, the clinical usefulness of doxorubicin is limited by unacceptable toxicity, such as cardiotoxicity and
myelosuppression, which may preclude adequate dosing.
To decrease its toxicity, new formulations have been
created, including pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. This
drug has shown efficacy in advanced HCC, with a
response rate of 10% to 17% and a median OS of 6.5
months; in particular, median OS was 12 months in
patients responding to treatment. Regarding safety, it
showed a well-tolerated profile even in the presence of
impaired liver function; hematologic toxicity and PPE
were the most frequently reported side effects.19,20
Another frequently used drug was gemcitabine,
which demonstrated activity against human hepatoma
cells in vitro21 and as a single agent or in combination
chemotherapy regimens for advanced HCC; phase 2 trials
have reported a response rate of about 18%,5 with favorable toxicity (finding grade 3-4 hematological toxicity in
only about 10% of patients).
In light of these observations, the present study
aimed at improving the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy
with a favorable toxicity by combining 2 relatively active
drugs in HCC with different mechanisms of cytotoxic
action and potential synergistic activity, lack of cross-resistance, and nonoverlapping toxicity.
In this study, we analyzed the association of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and gemcitabine; in particular, all patients received gemcitabine, a pyrimidine

Gemcitabine and Doxorubicin in HCC/Lombardi et al

nucleoside analogue, followed by the administration of
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, a type 2 antitopoisomerase. Various studies11,12 demonstrated that gemcitabine induces expression of all topoisomerase enzymes, and
the subsequent administration of pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin stabilizes the covalently bound topoisomerase-DNA complex,22 resulting in massive DNA damage
and cell death.
With an overall response rate of 24%, a disease control rate of 58.5%, a progression-free survival of 5.8
months, and a median survival of 22.5 months, this combination regimen compares favorably with other systemic
therapies for advanced HCC, including sorafenib and
other targeted agents (Table 7).
In the past, the attractive combination of free doxorubicin plus gemcitabine was analyzed by Yang et al.23
Unfortunately, they showed no CR, and PR was observed
in 11.8% of patients; the median OS was 4.6 months, and
the median TTP was 2.5 months. Likely, the lower clinical efficacy of this combination may be because of the
lower therapeutic index of free doxorubicin than pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. They found frequent grade
3-4 hematological toxicity, including neutropenia in
51.4% of patients, anemia in 45.7% of patients, and
thrombocytopenia in 25.7% of patients. Also, Eastern
patients recruited in these studies have worse clinical features in general than those recruited in the Western
world.24
In our study, we had 3 complete responses, and in 1
patient the complete remission was documented by histological examination. To our knowledge, only a few cases
of complete response after systemic chemotherapy in
advanced HCC have been described in the literature25,26;
1 case was reported using the gemcitabine-oxaliplatin
combination,26 and 4 patients had a complete pathological remission with a cisplatin/doxorubicin/5-fluorouracil/
a-interferon regimen25; conversely, in this last chemotherapy regimen the toxicities were considerable; in fact,
there were also 2 treatment-related deaths.
Moreover, our treatment was able to convert some
inoperable lesions into operable lesions, increasing their
overall survival; 1 patient with initially inoperable disease
underwent liver transplantation and was alive and free
from recurrence at 52.8 months from treatment.
Furthermore, the TTP obtained in our study was
similar to that shown by sorafenib, despite the finding
that in the sorafenib trial only 5% of patients had ChildPugh B; indeed, the TTP with gemcitabine-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin regimen was 5.5 months, and 53.7%

131

had Child-Pugh B. Thus, our regimen may be an effective
treatment for patients not eligible for sorafenib treatment
because of altered liver function.
In the past, the combination of gemcitabine and
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for advanced HCC was
also analyzed by Poh et al.27 They showed a poor clinical
efficacy of the treatment; no patient achieved a CR or PR,
with 2 (22%) patients with SD; the median OS was 2.8
months. In this study, the schedule was identical to that
used in our study, although the sequence of administration of the drugs is not reported; moreover, they evaluated
only 9 patients with advanced HCC, among whom there
were 4 (44%) patients already treated with prior systemic
chemotherapy (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and
capecitabine) and 8 (89%) patients who had prior locoregional treatment. Furthermore, 8 (88%) patients had extrahepatic metastases. Other differences from our study
were that all patients were from Asia and predominant etiology of HCC was chronic hepatitis B virus infection
(90%). Thus, it is not possible to make a comparison with
our study, which used this combination in chemonaive
Western patients, only 46.3% of whom had metastases,
53.6% of whom had prior locoregional treatment, and in
whom predominant etiology was hepatitis C virus
(48.8%).
We also conducted an exploratory analysis of predictive factors for TTP and OS. Independent predictors for
improved TTP and OS were good ECOG PS and earlier
stage disease, whereas lower serum AFP was an independent predictor only for improved OS. Moreover, our treatment was effective independently of liver function,
demonstrating a low hepatotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic combination.
Interestingly, a decrease in AFP of >20% after 2
cycles of chemotherapy was an independent favorable predictor for TTP and OS. Only 1 prior study showed AFP
response to be a predictive factor for survival in patients
undergoing systemic chemotherapy28; they analyzed 117
patients with elevated serum AFP (>20 ng/mL), showing
AFP responders had better survival than nonresponders.
Similar data were originally reported for tamoxifen treatment in HCC.29
Nevertheless, the toxicity of this combination was
acceptable; the most severe adverse effects were neutropenia (17%) and anemia (7%), whereas the expected PPE
appeared only in 7% of patients.
In conclusion, although our trial was a small phase 2
study, the combination of gemcitabine plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin proved effective and safe in patients

132

with advanced HCC, even in patients with impaired liver
function. In particular, patients with good ECOG PS,
early stage disease, and low serum AFP could derive the
greatest clinical benefit. In particular, this combination
may be useful in chemonaive patients not eligible for sorafenib treatment because of altered liver function. However, further randomized studies are needed, and it could
be useful to evaluate this combination alone or in association with the newer targeted agents such as sorafenib, erlotinib, and bevacizumab.
