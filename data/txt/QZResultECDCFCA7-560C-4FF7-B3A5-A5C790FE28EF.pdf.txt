ABSTRACT:
Translation initiation factors are over-expressed and/or activated in many
human cancers and may contribute to their genesis and/or progression. Removal
of physiologic restraints on translation initiation causes malignant transformation.
Conversely, restoration of physiological restrains on translation initiation reverts
malignant phenotypes. Here, we extensively characterize the anti-cancer activity
of two small molecule inhibitors of translation initiation: #1181, which targets the
eIF2∙GTP∙Met-tRNAi ternary complex, and 4EGI-1, which targets the eIF4F complex. In
vitro, both molecules inhibit translation initiation, abrogate preferentially translation
of mRNAs coding for oncogenic proteins, and inhibit proliferation of human cancer
cells. In vivo, both #1181 and 4EGI-1 strongly inhibit growth of human breast and
melanoma cancer xenografts without any apparent macroscopic- or microscopictoxicity. Mechanistically, #1181 phosphorylates eIF2α while 4EGI-1 disrupts eIF4G/
eIF4E interaction in the tumors excised from mice treated with these agents. These
data indicate that inhibition of translation initiation is a new paradigm in cancer
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

codon.
Translation initiation plays a critical role in cell
growth and malignant transformation [1-6]. In quiescent
cells eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) restrict the
abundance of the eIF4F complex, while phosphorylation
of eIF2α on S51 restricts the availability of the TC. In
proliferating cells, phosphorylation of 4E-BPs reduces
their affinity for eIF4E and increases the abundance of
the eIF4F complex [7]. Similarly dephosphorylation of
eIF2α allows for eIF2B catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange
on the eIF2∙GDP, and increases the abundance of the TC.
Malignant transformation is associated with a preferential
increase in the translation of mRNAs encoding for
growth factors and/or oncogenic proteins. These mRNAs
contain long and highly structured 5’UTRs, multiple
upstream untranslated open reading frames (uORFs), or

Eukaryotic translation is regulated by the eukaryotic
translation initiation factors (eIFs), features of mRNAs,
and signaling pathways. Two multi-protein complexes are
rate limiting for translation initiation. The eIF4F complex
is formed by the scaffolding protein eIF4G the RNA
helicase eIF4A, and the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E.
The ternary complex (TC) is formed by the interaction
of eIF2 with GTP and initiator methionine tRNA (MettRNAi). The eIF4F complex binds to the mRNA 5’ cap
structure and associates with 40S ribosomal subunit,
the TC, and other translation initiation factors to form
the 48S pre-initiation complex that scans the mRNA 5’
untranslated region (5’UTR) to locate the AUG initiation

other features that reduce their translational efficiency
and render them highly dependent on the activity of
translation initiation factors [4, 5]. Housekeeping proteins,
on the other hand, are coded for by efficiently translated
mRNAs with short and simple 5’UTRs. Unrestricted
translation, therefore, preferentially increases the
expression of oncogenic proteins and promotes malignant
transformation [8-11]. Consistently, restricting translation
initiation by reducing the abundance of either eIF4F or
TC preferentially decreases the expression of oncogenic
proteins thereby reverting malignant phenotypes [12-14].
Levels of eIF4E [8, 15-19], eIF4G [6, 20] and eIF4A
[21, 22] are frequently up-regulated in human cancers.
Notably, in head and neck and breast cancers, levels
of eIF4E correlate with disease progression and poor
prognosis [8, 10, 18, 23]. Similarly, in non-Hodgkin’s
lymphomas and thyroid carcinomas, levels of eIF2α

correlate with disease status [24-26].
In experimental models of cancer forced expression
of eIF4E [27], of a constitutively active but nonphosphorylatable mutant of eIF2α (eIF2α-S51A) [11]
or of initiator Met-tRNAi [28] transforms immortalized
fibroblasts. Conversely, decreasing the levels of eIF4E
by treatment with eIF4E anti-sense RNA or its activity
by ectopic expression of 4E-BPs partially reverses the
transformed phenotypes [9, 12, 13]. Pharmacologically,
treatment with eIF4E anti-sense RNA or agents that induce
phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits translation initiation and
proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, and reduces tumor
growth in animal models of human cancers [29-31].
Similarly, inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), which reduces phosphorylation of 4E-BPs [32,
33], exert anti-cancer activity in vitro [14, 34] and in vivo
[35]. Finally, small molecules such as pateamine A and

silvestrol - reduce the activity of the eIF4F complex by
modulating the activity of eIF4A thereby suppressing
translation initiation [36-38]. Taken together, these data
indicate that translation initiation is a promising new
paradigm and an attractive target for the development of
anti-cancer agents.
We previously reported the identification of the
translation initiation inhibitor 4EGI-1, which binds to
eIF4E and thereby disrupts eIF4E/eIF4G interaction [39].
Additionally, we reported on the development of #1181
[40], which causes eIF2α phosphorylation [40] thereby
inhibiting cap-dependent translation and proliferation of
cancer cells. These findings suggested that 4EGI-1 and
#1181 are suitable probes for testing the hypothesis that
small molecule inhibitors of translation initiation are

mechanism specific anti-cancer agents.
Here we report the anti-cancer efficacy, mode of
action, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles of 4EGI1 and #1181. Both agents inhibit translation initiation
and preferentially abrogate expression of oncogenic
proteins in vitro. In vivo, 4EGI-1 and #1181 strongly
inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models of human breast
and melanoma cancers with no sign of macroscopic- or
microscopic-toxicity at therapeutic doses. In xenograft
tumors, #1181 phosphorylates eIF2α and 4EGI-1 disrupts
eIF4G/eIF4E interaction. Both agents inhibit expression of
oncogenic proteins such as cyclin E, cyclin D1, c-Myc and
Bcl-2 in vivo. We conclude that translation initiation can
be pharmacologically targeted for cancer therapy.

but does not inhibit protein synthesis in cell-free extracts. A) Total RNA was prepared from CRL-2813 cells incubated for 3

the polysome profile was determined using fractioned RNA from polysome profiles shown in Figure 1C. C) The wild type eIF2α or S51A

RESULTS

#1181 induced expression of C/EBP homology protein
(CHOP) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4)- two
downstream effectors of eIF2α phosphorylation (Figures
1A, 2A, and 2B). In mechanistic assays, #1181 inhibited
cancer cell proliferation in an eIF2α phosphorylation
dependent manner. This was evidenced by the fact that
replacing endogenous eIF2α with recombinant eIF2α
S51A mutant rendered the cancer cells resistant to
inhibition of cell proliferation by #1181 as compared
to cells in which endogenous eIF2α was replaced with
recombinant wild type eIF2α (Figure 2C). Consistent
with demonstration that in intact cells, #1181 induces
phosphorylation of eIF2α via Ca++ release from internal
stores [40], this compound had no direct inhibitory effect
on protein synthesis in cell-free lysates (Figure 2D).
Expression of most proteins involved in
cell proliferation and malignant transformation is
translationally controlled and is highly dependent on the
activity of translation initiation factors. To determine if
#1181 and 4EGI-1 translationally downregulate expression
of oncogenic proteins, we performed Western blot (WB)
and quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of

In vitro characterization of #1181 and 4EGI-1.
Based on the high prevalence of breast cancer
and melanoma, we screened approximately 20 different
melanoma and breast cancer cell lines using a combination
of IC50 in vitro (Supplemental Table S1) and tumorigenicity
in nude mice as final selection criteria. Consequently,
human melanoma (CRL-2813) and breast cancer (MCF-7
and CRL-1500) cells were chosen for testing the in vitro
and in vivo efficacy of #1181 and 4EGI-1.
Inhibition of translation initiation in vitro: In
mechanistic assays, #1181 induced phosphorylation of
eIF2α (Figure 1A). As shown previously, 4EGI-1 reduced
the association of eIF4G with eIF4E (Figure 1B) [39].
Both compounds shifted the polysome profile of cancer
cells from heavy to light polysomes or free ribosomal
subunits (Figure 1C), clearly demonstrating that #1181
and 4EGI-1 inhibit translation initiation. Furthermore,

Figure 3: #1181 and 4EGI-1 preferentially inhibit expression of oncogenic proteins. A) CRL-2813 human melanoma cells

were treated with the indicated concentrations of #1181 or 4EGI-1, lysates were prepared and probed with antibodies specific to Bcl-2,
b-FGF, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Survivin, α-Tubulin β-Actin, and Ubiquitin. B) RNA was prepared from similarly treated cells and
levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, survivin, b-FGF, c- Myc, Bcl-2 and β-actin mRNAs were determined. Shown are mRNA levels for c-myc
and bcl-2 relative to controls. Data for other mRNAs are shown in the Supplementary Figure S4. C) The level of various oncogenic and
housekeeping mRNAs in the polysome fractions of cells treated with vehicle, #1181 and 4EGI-1 were determined by QRT-PCR.

lysates from CRL-2813 human melanoma cells treated
with #1181, 4EGI-1 or vehicle (DMSO). Figure 3A shows
that both compounds significantly reduced the expression
of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Bcl-2, bFGF and Survivin
while the expression of housekeeping proteins such as
β-Actin, α-Tubulin and Ubiquitin was not affected (for
quantitation of WB data see Supplemental Figure S1).
Down-regulation of most oncogenic proteins was likely
translational because the compounds had minimal effects
on the levels of the respective mRNAs (Figure 3B and
Supplemental Figure S2). In a few instances, and only at
high concentrations of #1181 or 4EGI-1, accumulation of
oncogenic mRNAs was reduced (Supplemental Figure
S2). These findings are consistent with the view that
inhibitors of translation initiation preferentially affect
the expression of oncogenic proteins. This was further
confirmed by QRT-PCR measuring the distribution of
mRNAs in the polysome fractions by RT-PCR (Figure
3C). The shift in polysome profile caused by treatment
with #1181 or 4EGI-1 (Figure 1C) was associated with a

preferential shift in the distribution of oncogenic mRNAs
from heavy to light polysomes or polysome-free fractions.
Both #1181 and 4EGI-1 translationally reduced the
expression of mTOR protein (Figure 4A and Supplemental
S3) and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Figures 4A) with
no effect on the levels of mTOR mRNA (Figure 4B).
This is consistent with the known pleiotropic effects of
the mTOR [41]. It must be noted; however, that 4EGI-1
inhibits eIF4E/eIF4G interaction independently of 4E-BP1
binding to eIF4E [39]. Furthermore, neither #1181 nor
4EGI-1 impinge directly on the PI3-K Akt pathway that is
activated in the MCF-7 and CRL-1500 breast cancer cells,
or the B-raf/Erk pathway that is activated in CRL-2813
melanoma cell line, as demonstrated by the experiment
depicted in Supplemental Figures S4A and S4B.
In vivo characterization of #1181 and 4EGI-1: To
assess the in vivo anti-cancer activity of #1181 and 4EGI1 we attempted to determine the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of both agents by injecting groups of 5 male and
5 female nude mice with different intraperitoneal (i.p.)

Figure 4: Translation initiation inhibitors abrogate mTOR expression and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. A) CRL-2813 cells

were treated with the indicated concentrations of #1181 or 4EGI-1. Cell lysates were probed with antibodies specific to mTOR, 4E-BP1
phosphorylated (p4E-BP1) on the indicated residues, total 4E-BP1, and β-actin. B) Cells were treated as in A and level of mTOR mRNA in
treated cells relative to control cells was determined by QRT-PCR.

doses of each compound for 5 consecutive days. This
was followed by observation for an additional 14 days.
At the concentrations used, neither compound caused
significant weight loss, behavioral changes, reduced daily
food intake, or any other overt toxicity (Figure 5). Limited
solubility of compounds in aqueous buffers precluded
further dose escalation to determine MTD. The long-term
organ toxicity was evaluated by treating mice i.p. for 21
days with daily injections of the highest compound dose
used in the efficacy studies described below. Necropsy
pathological analysis of these mice did not reveal any
macro- or microscopic evidence of organ toxicity (Figure
6 and Supplemental S5).
Plasma concentration-time profiles of the two
compounds in mice treated i.p. with a 25 mg/kg of #1181
in 200 µL of corn oil or 50 mg/kg of 4EGI-1 in 25 µl of
DMSO are presented in Supplemental Figure S6A. Both
compounds were rapidly absorbed from the peritoneal
cavity, with peak concentrations C(max) = 5.2 µM and
139 µM occurring at t(max) = 52 min and 43 min for
#1181 and 4EGI-1, respectively. Plasma concentrations of
both compounds decayed in a mono-exponential manner
with half-life t1/2 = 1.6 h for #1181 and 3.4 h for 4EGI1. Values of the apparent total body clearance were
CL/F = 90.4 and 2.4 ml/min/kg for #1181 and 4EGI-1,

respectively. Furthermore, as shown in Supplemental
Figures S6B and S6C, the plasma concentration of #1181
or 4EGI-1 exhibited excellent dose dependence. The
doses and treatment regimens were chosen based on these
findings. Due to its lower plasma exposure and shorter
half-life, #1181 was administered twice daily, (b.i.d.)
while 4EGI-1 was administered once a day (q.d.).

Inhibition of tumor growth:
Mice bearing CRL-2813 human melanoma tumors
(apparent volume of ≈ 200 mm3) were randomized into
control and treatment groups. Compound #1181 was
dissolved in corn oil and injected i.p. 175 mg/kg b.i.d
in 125 µl corn oil 12 h apart. Control animals received,
by the same regimen, the same daily amount of corn oil.
Figure 7A (left panel) and Supplemental Figure S7A (left
panel) show that #1181 totally abolished human melanoma
xenograft tumor growth.
To determine if #1181 inhibits growth of mammary
tumors, estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells were inoculated into the fat pad of the 4th inguinal
mammary gland of female mice implanted with slow
release 17-β-estradiol pellets in the subscapular region.
Animals bearing ≈150 mm3 tumors were randomized into

Figure 5: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) assay for #1181 and 4EGI-1. MTD was assessed by injecting groups of 5 male

and 5 female nude mice with different intra-peritoneal (i.p.) doses of each compound for 5 consecutive days followed by observation for
additional 15 days, in accord with NIH protocols. At the concentrations used, injection of either compound did not result in significant
weight loss, reduced daily food intake, behavioral changes or any other observable sign of toxicity.

control and treatment groups and administered #1181 i.p.
at 60 or 140 mg/kg b.i.d. in 100 µl of corn oil 12 h apart or
the same regimen of daily amount of corn oil. Figure 7A
(right panel) and Supplemental Figure S7A (right panel)
show that #1181 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of
MCF-7 human breast cancer tumor growth; the highest
dose induced a ≈ 30% regression of the tumors.
To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of 4EGI-1,
mice bearing ≈ 200 mm3 human melanoma tumors were
randomized into three groups and injected i.p. with 25
or 75 mg/kg q.d. 4EGI-1 in 12.5 µl DMSO or 12.5 µl
DMSO. Figure 7B (left panel) and Supplemental Figure
S7B (left panel) show that 4EGI-1 significantly, and dosedependently, inhibited human melanoma xenograft tumor
growth. Similarly, mice bearing orthotropic ≈200 mm3
CRL-1500 derived xenograft breast tumors were treated
i.p. with 75mg/kg q.d. of 4EGI-1 in 12.5 µl DMSO,
with control animals receiving the same daily amount
of DMSO. Figure 7B (right panel) and S7B (right panel)
show that 4EGI-1 caused a significant inhibition of CRL1500 human breast tumor growth.

phosphorylated or total eIF2α. Figures 8A and 8B show
that #1181 significantly increased the phosphorylation
of eIF2α in the tumors. The in vivo effects of compound
4EGI-1 on the formation of eIF4F complex were
investigated by pulling-down eIF4E from tumor lysates
by 7-methylguanosine diphosphate (M7GDP)-Sepharose
affinity chromatography followed by WB analysis of
eIF4E, eIF4G and 4E-BP1. Tumors from mice treated
with 4EGI-1 showed a reduced association of eIF4E with
eIF4G and an increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1
(Figures 8C and 8D).
We also stained tumor sections with antibodies
specific to phosphorylated 4E-BP1 and oncogenic and
growth promoting proteins such as cyclin D1, cyclin E,
c-Myc, Bcl-2, and VEGF. Consistent with their in vitro
activities both #1181 and 4EGI-1 reduced phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 (Figure 9) and the expression of oncogenic
proteins in the tumors (Figure 10 and Supplemental
Figures S8-S10). Both agents significantly reduced the
expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA,
Supplemental Figures S8-S10) without any effect on the
expression of B-raf, phosphorylated Erk1/2 or Akt, or
increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells as determined
by TUNEL assay (Supplemental Figure S11).

Molecular analysis of tumors
To assess their in vivo mode of action, we evaluated
the effects of #1181 and 4EGI-1 on the phosphorylation
of eIF2α and disruption of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction in the
excised tumors. Paraffin embedded sections of melanoma
and breast tumors excised from mice treated with #1181
or vehicle were stained with antibodies specific to S51

DISCUSSION
Excessive activation and/or overexpression
of translation initiation factors cause malignant
transformation and maintenance of transformed
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo [8-11, 27]. Translation

initiation factors are also implicated in the genesis,
maintenance and progression of human cancers [8, 16-19]
suggesting that translation initiation may be an attractive
target for cancer therapy. However, the lack of potent and
specific small molecule inhibitors of translation initiation
has hampered the experimental assessment of whether the
translation initiation machinery can be pharmacologically
targeted for therapeutic purposes.
The work reported here provides direct evidence
that inhibition of translation initiation with either #1181
or 4EGI-1 abrogates tumor growth in two animal models
of human cancer. Compound #1181 induces eIF2α
phosphorylation, which reduces the abundance of the
TC. Compound 4EGI-1 inhibits eIF4E/eIF4G proteinprotein interaction, which reduces the abundance of
the eIF4F complex [39, 40]. Both compounds abrogate
tumor growth and cause comparable down-regulation of
oncogenic proteins in vivo. Importantly, histo-pathological

and hematological analysis of treated tumor-bearing
mice demonstrated that neither 4EGI-1 nor #1181 cause
any sign of overt toxicity. Our demonstration that both
compounds recapitulate in vivo their biological activities
in vitro validates the concept that the anti-cancer effect of
both compounds is most likely mediated by inhibition of
translation initiation.
One of the oncogenic proteins translationally
down regulated by both 4EGI-1 and #1181 is mTOR,
which couples PI3K/Akt signaling with assembly of
the eIF4F complex by inducing phosphorylation of 4EBP1. This in-turn reduces 4E-BP1’s affinity for eIF4E
and makes it available for eIF4F assembly. This suggests
the 4EGI-1 and #1181 may create a feedback loop that
further potentiates their inhibitory effect, and potentially
highlights another major advantage of small molecule
inhibitors of translation initiation for cancer therapy.
Our findings indicate that by depriving cancer

cells of the oncogenic proteins critical for maintaining
their transformed phenotype, small molecules #1181
and 4EGI-1 target cancer cells at their “Achilles
heel” [42, 43]. Targeting the expression of multiple
oncogenic proteins that the cancer cells are addicted to
represents a new paradigm in cancer therapy and has
distinct advantages over both conventional genotoxic
therapies and recently developed therapeutic agents that
target a single oncogene/survival factor [44]. The latter
therapeutic approach is compromised because cancer
cells develop resistance to the drug by either activating
redundant/alternate pathway(s) to compensate for the loss
of the targeted molecule or sustain mutations that renders
the primary target refractory to the therapeutic agent
[45]. Significant progress in resolving the structure of
translation initiation factors [46, 47] as well as discovery
of novel inhibitory agents [48], should significantly aid

discovery and development of translation initiation
inhibitors. In conclusion, inhibition of translation initiation
is a promising complement to the prevailing anti-cancer
therapies because it is aimed at the convergent point of
oncogenic and proliferative pathways. This paradigm
represents a solid rational for developing and testing small
molecule inhibitors of translation initiation in clinical
studies for anti-cancer therapy.

quantified with ProImage software. All antibodies used
for these studies are listed in Supplemental Table S2.

QRT-PCRs were also performed to determine the
polysome profile shifts for β-actin, mTOR, Bcl-2, c-Myc,
cyclin D1 and ATF-4 using total RNA isolated from
polysome fractions.

Western blot analysis.

m7GTP Pull-Down assay.

The WB analysis was performed as described [49].
For eIF2α phosphorylation, cells were treated with either
#1181 or DMSO for 1 hour. For analysis of other proteins,
cells were incubated for 8 hours in the presence or absence
of each compound.

CRL-2813 cells were treated with 4EGI-1 or DMSO
for 8 hours, harvested by centrifugation and lysed. The
interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G was determined by the
m7GTP Pull-Down assay as described [39]. For in vivo
pull-down experiments, extracts of tumors excised from
mice treated with either 4EGI-1 or DMSO were similarly
analyzed.

Quantitative Real-time PCR analysis.
Cells were incubated for 8 hours in the presence
or absence of the compounds. The FastLane Cell SYBR
Green Kit (Qiagen) was used to purify and analyze the
mRNA levels with an Applied Biosystems Thermocycler.
RT-PCR quantitation of the mRNAs relative to β-actin
mRNA was done using the ΔΔCT method. Sequencevalidated QuantiTec probes for bcl-2, bFGF, survivin,
mTOR, cyclin D1, cyclin E, c-Myc, and β-actin purchased
from Qiagen Bio-technology were used for these mRNAs.
