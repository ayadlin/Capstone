BACKGROUND. Ovarian cancer patients frequently receive chemotherapy near the
end of life. The purpose of the current study was to develop indicators that characterize those ovarian cancer patients who have a short life span.

METHODS. The medical charts of deceased epithelial ovarian cancer patients were
retrospectively reviewed from 2000 through 2006. All patients received primary
debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Aggressiveness of cancer care
within the last month of life was measured by chemotherapy regimens, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. Significant clinical events (SCE) were
defined as ascites, bowel obstruction, and pleural effusion. Survival quartiles
were compared using chi-square and Student t test statistics. Multiple regression
analysis was performed using survival duration as a dependent variable.

RESULTS. In all, 113 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were reviewed.
Patients had increased hospitalizations (P < .001) and SCE (P < .001) as they
approached the end of life. There was no difference in the pattern of hospitalizations and SCE between the top and bottom survival quartiles. Patients with a
shorter survival time had a trend toward increased chemotherapy during their
last 3 months of life (P 5 .057) and had increased overall aggressiveness of care
(P 5 .013). In patients with a disease remission, the length of initial remission
time was found to be significant in predicting survival (P < .01). Time to second
disease recurrence was also significant in predicting survival time (P < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS. Patients who received aggressive care did not have improvement in survival. Short disease remissions and increasing hospitalizations with
SCE should be indicators of the appropriateness of reducing cure-oriented therapies and increasing palliative interventions. Cancer 2008;112:2221–7.  2008

uality of life at the end of life (EOL) in ovarian cancer patients
may be hindered by chemotherapy and aggressive care. Previous
investigations of the clinical care of cancer patients at the EOL
reveal substantial amounts of chemotherapy being provided along
with increased hospitalizations.1,2 Although the importance of quality of EOL care is a major focus, the trajectory of the disease process, or rapidity to terminal stage, is something that can affect care
at the EOL as well.3
Prognostic indicators such as performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory values have been explored to predict the EOL
in cancer patients.4 While exploring diagnostic and procedure codes
in ovarian cancer patients, we found that admissions for bowel
obstruction, pleural effusion, and ascites increased toward the EOL.2

the EOL revealed new chemotherapy regimens,
emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and
short hospice enrollment increasing over the past
decade.5 Earle et al.’s5 indicators of aggressive cancer
care are very similar to those of the National Quality
Forum’s (NQF)6 consensus standards for symptom
management and EOL care for patients with cancer.
There is growing consensus that these standards can
be used as targets for improving the quality of care
in patients with advanced cancer. Because palliative
care and hospice services have become an increasingly crucial part of our healthcare systems, the
guidelines endorse a framework for care that is
intended to develop a comprehensive quality measurement and reporting system. Because not all cancer patients have the same clinical symptoms and
clinical course, it is important to explore what happens to ovarian cancer patients at the EOL.
Because the majority of patients with recurrent
ovarian cancer receive palliative chemotherapy at the
time of disease recurrence, an effective strategy to
guide patients and physicians with regard to when to
withdraw therapy is imperative to improve quality
care near the EOL. Thus, we believe that focusing
research on clinical care patterns is crucial to
improving quality of life. The purpose of the current
study was to develop indicators that characterize
those ovarian cancer patients who have a short life
and evaluate trends in hospice transfer. We hypothesized that those patients with a short trajectory
between diagnoses and death received more aggressive care and chemotherapy at the EOL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The medical charts of patients diagnosed with
epithelial ovarian cancer who died during the years
between 2000 and 2006 were retrospectively
reviewed. For the years 2000 and 2001, charts were
reviewed at Akron General Medical Center, SUMMA
Heath System, Aultman Health Foundation, and University Hospitals Case Medical Center (UHCMC)
(n 5 62). From 2002 through 2006, charts were
reviewed only at UHCMC (n 5 51). Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained for this retrospective study. Patients who never received chemotherapy or underwent primary debulking surgery or
those who had a survival duration of <30 days were
not included. Details of the method collections have
been previously published.2
Aggressiveness of cancer care (ACE) was defined
according to Earle et al.5 and includes occurrence of
any of the following events: start of a new chemotherapy within 30 days of death, last chemotherapy within

14 days of death, >1 emergency room visit within the
last month of life, >14 days in the hospital within
the last month of life, >1 hospital admission within
the last month of life, admission to the intensive care
unit within the last month of life, and hospice
patients with a length of stay of 3 days. These definitions are also used by the NQF as standards for assessing quality of care in cancer patients, with a lower
incidence representing better EOL care.6
Significant clinical events (SCE) were defined as
hospitalizations for bowel obstruction, pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis, and abdominal ascites
requiring paracentesis.2 Palliative procedures not
requiring hospitalization were not included. Data
were analyzed in 3-month intervals within the last
year of life. Only 1 event (primary SCE) per hospitalization was counted if multiple SCEs occurred within
the same hospitalization. Repetitive SCEs were
defined as the same SCE event occurring repeatedly
within a time period of 2 months.
Hospitalizations (including emergency room visits) were documented according to International
Classification of Diseases (9th revision) (ICD-9) diagnosis codes and categorized into system management categories. To determine the number of
patients hospitalized within each quarter, hospitalizations were counted only once during each quarterly interval, even if a woman was hospitalized more
than once per interval. To determine the total number of hospitalizations and reasons for hospitalization for each quarterly interval, all hospitalizations
and codes were counted.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient
demographic and clinical variables and ACE. Hospice
care and ACE indicators were compared between
2000 and 2002 (timeframe of prior publication) versus 2003 and 2006 by the chi-square or Fisher exact
test. When pertinent, patients were stratified according to survival quartiles and variables were compared
by use of the chi-square and Student t test between
the upper and lower quartiles. The number of SCEs
and hospitalizations in all patients were compared
using the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for trend
for quarterly time periods during the last year of life.
In charts reviewed from UHCMC for patients who
died between 2000 and 2006 (n 5 56 because of the
availability of charts), multiple regression analysis
was performed to examine the length of survival (dependent variable) and independent variables of age,
number of SCEs, ACE, stage of disease, and time to
first and second recurrence as independent variables.
Patients were assigned a score of 0 to 6 according to

the number of ACEs they experienced. Similarly,
each patient was given a score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 representing the number of SCEs they experienced during
the last year of life (at any timepoint). Regression
analysis was repeated with time to second disease recurrence (defined as the time from original diagnosis
until the second disease recurrence) as well. Pearson
correlation coefficients, variance inflation factor, and
tolerance were used to examine correlations and
multicollinearity between variables. SPSS statistical
software (version 14.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) was
used for analysis.

RESULTS
The medical records from 113 patients who received
primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with a death date during the years 2000 through
2006 were reviewed. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. The median age of the patients at
death was 62.5 years; 32 patients were aged >70 years.
Approximately 91% of the women had stage III or
stage IV disease (determined according to the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grading system).
The median survival from the date of diagnosis was
33 months and the median number of chemotherapy
regimens administered was 3.
Forty-six percent of patients died in their home
(with or without hospice support). Approximately
54% of patients had some form of hospice support
either in their home or at a hospice center. Twenty-six
of 63 patients (41%) who died between 2000 and 2002
received hospice care (either home care or at a center)
compared with 35 of 50 patients (70%) who died
between 2003 and 2006 (P 5 .002). Eighteen of 65
patients (27.7%) who received chemotherapy during

2223

the last 3 months of life died in the hospital compared
with only 1 of 48 patients who did not receive chemotherapy during this time (P < .001).
Approximately 31% of patients received aggressive
care at the EOL (Table 2). Death in an acute hospital
setting and starting a new chemotherapy regimen
within the last 30 days were the most common indicators at 16.8% and 11.5%, respectively. There was no
difference overall in ACE indicators noted over the
study period because 33% of patients who died
between 2000 and 2002 and 28% of patients who died
between 2003 and 2006 had positive ACE indicators
(Table 2, P 5 .542). However, patients from 2000
through 2002 died more frequently at the hospital
than those who died between 2003 and 2006
(P 5 .026). In patients with an ACE indicator
(excluding death at a hospital), 10 of 27 patients (37%)
died in the hospital compared with 9 of 86 patients
(10.5%) without any ACE measures (P 5 .0013). There
was no statistically significant difference (P 5 .981)
noted with regard to the proportion receiving hospice
care among patients with at least 1 ACE indicator
(15 of 27 patients; 55.6%) and those with no ACE indicators (48 of 86 patients; 55.8%). Approximately 14%
of ACE patients had 2 indicators.
Data from patients in the lower (n 5 28) and
upper (n 5 28) survival quartiles were compared
(Table 3). Patients with a shorter survival time had a
trend toward receiving more chemotherapy during
their last 3 months of life (P 5 .057) and received
more aggressive care (P 5 .013). Approximately 53%
of patients in the lower survival quartile had at least
1 ACE indicator compared with 21% of patients in
the upper survival quartile.
Administering a new chemotherapy regimen
within the last 30 days of life resulted in many other
interactions. Six of 13 patients (46%) who received a
new chemotherapy regimen within the last 30 days
before death had >1 hospital admission during the
last month of life or were hospitalized 14 days during the last month of life compared with 11 of 100
patients (11%) who did not receive a new chemotherapy regimen during this time (P < .001).
The number of SCEs increased in all patients
during the last year of life (Table 4). SCEs were not
found to be significantly different between patients
in the lower and upper survival quartiles and the frequency of these events occurred equally in the upper
and lower survival quartiles. Increased aggressiveness
of care, indicated by ACE, was not associated with a
decrease in SCE. Twenty-three of 113 patients
(20.4%) had repetitive SCEs, with the most common
being ascites requiring paracentesis. Hospitalizations
increased as patients approached the EOL and there

and 2006 at UHCMC. In patients with a disease
remission, the length of initial remission time was
found to be significant in predicting survival (P < .01).
Because the majority of ovarian cancer patients go
into a first disease remission, time to second disease
recurrence was used for prediction of survival over
first disease remission. Duration from diagnosis to
second disease recurrence was found to be statistically significant in predicting the duration of survival
in these patients (Pearson correlation coefficient
[r] 5 .57; P < .01) (Table 5). Because this variable
included the time from diagnosis to the first disease
recurrence (initial disease remission time), only time
to second disease recurrence was used in the final
regression model. Age, stage, and ACE trended toward
significance in predicting the duration of survival, but
the number of SCEs experienced was not found to be
significant. Increasing age and number of ACEs
experienced was associated with a trend toward a
decrease in the duration of survival.

DISCUSSION
A substantial number of ovarian cancer patients are
receiving aggressive care at the EOL, including frequent hospitalizations, significant clinical events,
and chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that
those patients with a short trajectory of disease
appeared to have the same significant clinical
events, which increased over time in all patients,
suggesting that the characteristics of patients in the
terminal phase of illness is similar to those with longer survival duration. Not surprisingly, time to second disese recurrence was found to be predictive of
survival. ACE, age, and stage of disease were not
found to be significant contributors to the model,
highlighting that increasing aggressive care does not
improve survival.
Approximately 31% of the patients in the current
study had positive indicators of ACE within the last
month of life. Earle et al.5 analyzed Medicare claims

2225

in nearly 30,000 patients who died within 1 year of
an initial diagnosis of lung, breast, colorectal, or
other gastrointestinal cancers. Through their previously identified indicators, they found a 30% incidence of ACE. Because our patient population
included many patients who were >1 year from diagnosis, it would be anticipated that the percentage of
patients in this study with positive indicators of
aggressive care would have been <30% because they
have a more predictable course of disease recurrences and remissions. According to the NQF, all the
aggressiveness of care measures reflect deviations
from quality indicators. Because palliative care and
hospice services have become an increasingly crucial
part of our healthcare systems, the guidelines
endorse a framework for care that is intended to develop a comprehensive quality measurement and
reporting system.
Others have attempted to identify ovarian cancer
patients unlikely to benefit from palliative chemotherapy. In what to our knowledge is 1 of the largest
studies published to date, Hoskins and Le7 described
a model for survival in 120 patients for whom data
were available after first disease recurrence. This was
done with the purpose of guiding chemotherapy
decisions after the patients developed disease recurrence. A predictive model based on the length of
time between diagnosis to second disease recurrence
was found to be predictive of which patients would
survive <6 months. In particular patients, however,
they found that multiple episodes of retreatment
were of value. Of interest, expected prognostic variables such as age, residual tumor at the time of original surgery, grade, stage, and pleural effusions were
not significant predictors of survival after the first
disease recurrence. We also found age and stage to
be nonsignificant variables after the first disease recurrence, with ACE being similarly nonsignificant. A
recent article determined that more chemotherapy in
ovarian cancer patients may not translate into longer
survival but does increase morbidity.8
We found that patients who progress and die
rapidly are more likely to receive therapy shortly
before death. This is more likely a measure of the
aggressive nature of the disease and not a function
of chemotherapy treatment. Tumor biology and platinum resistance all play a part in the aggressiveness
of ovarian cancer. However, our findings do suggest
that in the presence of rapidly progressive disease,
aggressive care measures such as new chemotherapy
regimens within the last month of life and the
administration of chemotherapy within the last
2 weeks of life are not associated with a survival
benefit.

It is well known that for some individuals, continuing ‘the fight’, regardless of effectiveness, has great
meaning and adds value to existence.9 For example,
Brown et al.10 reported that only 5% of their sample
of 108 women with gynecologic malignancies predicted that they would ‘give up the fight’ if the time
came that their treatment was no longer working.
The study by Donovan et al.11 examining treatment
preferences using a decision board found that 25% of
recently diagnosed ovarian cancer patients indicated
that they would never switch to palliative care, but
would choose salvage therapy even if the anticipated
median survival time was <1 week. Although it is the
patient’s decision to continue therapy, physicians do
have some influence on this course of action. Studies
have shown that cancer physicians consistently overestimate the duration of survival.12,13
In the current study, the upper and lower quartiles of survival differed with regard to chemotherapy
patterns and aggressiveness of care, but were similar
with regard to hospice patterns and SCEs or clinical
pattern of death. Those patients who received the
most aggressive care within the last month of life did
not have the longest survival. In all patients, regardless of quartile, SCE events were rarely observed
before 6 months before death. However, in the
6 months before death and especially within the last
3 months, there was a marked increase in the number of events and repetitive occurrences. Absence of
SCE should not be viewed as indicating that conversations about goals of care do not need to occur. The
occurrence of these events, however, does suggest an
increased likelihood of the onset of the terminal
phase and should prompt discussions regarding
goals and transitions to a comfort-oriented plan of
care. Unfortunately, the majority of women died
without hospice support despite our improvements
in hospice transfers. Recent evidence from Connor
et al.14 indicates that there may be a survival benefit
to patients enrolled in hospice. Since the initiation of
this study in 2002, our division has developed a
heightened awareness to this issue and, as illustrated
in this report, our practice patterns have changed
over time. However, continued improvement, both at
our center and in the community, is still needed.
Trajectories have been used to describe functional decline before death.15 Patient groups differ in
the slope of decline between sudden death, organ
failure, frailty, and terminal illness. Based on hospitalizations, we hypothesize that the trajectory of death
in ovarian cancer patients undulates with a steady
decline (Fig. 1). It may also be described as ‘‘entryreentry,’’ a pattern in which individuals decline but
return home, or receive further therapy between

FIGURE 1. Theoretic trajectory of dying in patients with recurrent ovarian
cancer.

stays in the hospital.15 Although this is a retrospective descriptive report, it should evoke thoughtful
consideration in the cancer care provider.
Our data source was a retrospective review of
medical records with inherent limitations, including
the lack of a quality-of-life component and cost
measures. In general, the majority of our patients are
treated in our health system, but there is always the
possibility of unknown events (hospitalizations and
SCE) that occurred at other facilities and are not
included in our medical charts. Patients with
advanced cancer may be directly admitted to a hospital floor instead of being directed to the emergency
room; therefore, our ACE numbers related to emergency room admissions may be falsely low. In addition, there are those circumstances in which patients
are admitted to the hospital for palliative reasons,
although this dataset revealed that the most common
reasons for hospital admission were related to digestive and circulatory problems. Finally, our regression
analysis included only 56 patients. Prospective studies of ovarian cancer patients at the EOL would
ensure the capture of these events.
There is a difference between palliative chemotherapy administered early in the trajectory of disease and near the EOL. It is unknown whether
chemotherapy was given in these study patients with
the goal of palliation of symptoms or the prolongation of life; however, we suspect the latter. Regardless, time to second disease recurrence should be a
trigger for less chemotherapy, less aggressive care,
and EOL discussions with the patient. The goal of
EOL care should be to avoid interventions, such as
cytotoxic chemotherapy, that are likely to decrease
the quality of life while failing to increase survival.
Despite the lack of prospective randomized trials,

Ovarian CA and Aggressiveness of Care/von Gruenigen et al.

there is evidence indicating that specific procedures,
such as paracentesis and thoracentesis, relieve symptoms more than chemotherapy at the EOL.2 In addition, these definitions may blend further as
noncytotoxic therapies, such as bevacizumab
(Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) may be a
viable palliative care option for ascites.16
Although these data do not provide definitive
guidelines regarding when to withdraw aggressive
care and chemotherapy, the current study does provide a prescriptive message—as cancer care providers, we have an obligation for improvement. Finally,
this information should be shared with patients and
their families. It is also the hope that cooperative
cancer research groups embark on prospective trials
near the EOL so that clinical cancer research is not
limited to pharmacologic agents.
