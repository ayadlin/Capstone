ABSTRACT
Background: Exosomes are small vesicles of endosomal origin, and they can
be used for the diagnosis and the treatment. However, limited data were for the
evaluation of the trend of exosome researches. This study aims to investigate the
trend of exosome researches and compare the contribution of research from different
regions, organizations and authors.
Methods: Exosome related publications from 2007 to 2016 were retrieved from
the Web of Science database. Excel, GraphPad Prism 5 and VOSviewer software were
used to analyze the research trend.
Results: A total of 1852 papers were identified and were cited 62967 times. The
United States accounted for 38.8% of the articles, 42.0% of the citations, and the
highest H-index (76). China ranked the second in the number of articles, but the sixth
in citation frequency (4337) and the fourth in H-index (36). The journals, PLoS ONE
and J Biol Chem had the highest number of publications. The author, Gabrielsson S.,
has published the most papers in this field (22). The keyword “ribonucleic acid” was
mentioned the most at 746 times, and the words, “stem cell”, “drug resistance” and
“monocyte cell factor” were the latest hotspots appeared around 2015.
Conclusion: Literature growth related to exosome is expanding rapidly. The
quality of the articles from China still requires improvement. Recent studies focus on
the relationship with tumor, and “stem cell”, “drug resistance” and “michigan cancer
foundation-7” may be the newest topics that should be closely followed in exosome
research.

Valadi manifested that exosomes contain mRNAs,
microRNAs, DNA fragments and proteins that have
biological activities in 2007 [3, 4]. In addition, evidence
is accumulating that exosomes can be used for diagnosis
of renal function, Parkinson’s disease and cancers
like pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer
[5–10]. Meanwhile, there is a growing interest in the

INTRODUCTION
Exosomes are small vesicles 30nm to 120 nm in
diameter [1], defined by Johnstone in 1987 [2]. These
secreted vesicles are present in many and perhaps all
biological fluids, including blood, urine and cultured
medium of cell cultures. It has become a hot topic since

clinical applications of exosomes. And it is predicted that
exosomes can be used for prognosis, for therapy, and as
biomarkers for health and disease [11, 12]. Researches on
exosomes have developed dramatically in the near years,
but the evolution of scientific output in this field has been
poorly explored to date and there are few internationally
published reports on research activity in exosome.
Bibliometrics is defined as the application of statistics
and mathematics for the analysis of written publications
such as books and journal articles [13]. Bibliometrics is a
good choice to evaluate the trend in research activity over
time. Bibliometrics uses the literature system and literature
metrology characteristics as research objects and analyzes
the literatures quantitatively and qualitatively [14]. This
type of analysis obtains the bibliographical works within
a given field, topic, institution or country. It can provide
an access to characterize the development in a certain field
[15] and has helped a lot in govern policy making, clinical
guideline and research trend in diabetes [16], respiratory
medicine [17] and gastrointestinal diseases [18].
The aims of this study were to examine the publication
pattern of exosome research output at the global level using
the web of science (Thomson Reuters Company) since 2007.
The geographic and temporal distribution of publications
related to exosome were measured, together with the most
used keywords, and the journals most commonly chosen. It
is the latter application that we will highlight in this article,
by using bibliometric mapping tools to map developments
within exosome. Results were analyzed to better understand
the field’s structure or determining developments in exosome
research.

relative research interest of exosome has grown year by
year (Figure 2A). The United States published the most
papers (719, 38.8%), followed by China (301, 16.3%) and
Germany (157, 8.5%). The United States published the
most papers per year (Figure 2A).

Citation and H-index analysis
According to the analysis of the Web of Science
database, all articles related to exosome had been cited
62967 times since 2007 (41379 times without self-citations).
The cited frequency per paper was 33.8 times. The number
of citations of papers from the United States was 26440,
accounting for 42.0% of the total citations. The H-index
of papers from the United States was 76. Germany ranked
second with the citation frequency of 7670 and the H-index
of 49. The number of publications of China ranked second,
but the citation frequency and H-index ranked the sixth and
forth respectively (Figure 2B).

Distribution of institutes paying attention to
exosomes
The institute with the greatest number of
publications was Harvard University with a total of 36
papers, accounting for 1.94% of all published literature
relating to the field. There were four French institutes
in the top 15 institutes list. Meanwhile, 3 Chinese
institutes, 3 American institutes, 2 Australian institutes,
1 English institute, 1 German institute and 1 Swedish
institute were on the list (Figure 2C). Publications from
top 15 institutes accounted for 21.24% of all literature
on exosome.

in this field (22 papers), followed by Zhang H.G. from
University of Louisville in the United States with 20
publications and Conti E. with 18 publications. Xu WR
from Jiangsu University and Wang Y from Shanghai
Jiaotong Univeristy were the most productive authors in
China (Table 1).

(IF=3.057, 2016) published the most with 103 papers.
Forty-two articles were published in the Nature and its
series on exosome. The top 15 journals that published the
most papers are shown in Figure 2D.

Growth trends prediction of exosomes
Model fitting curves of exosome publication
growth showed a significant correlation between the year
and cumulative number of exosome publications as in
Figure 3. The publication number for 2017 was estimated
by using cumulative publication numbers from 2007
to 2016. The worldwide, the United States, China and
Germany were estimated to reach 2385, 908, 385 and 212
articles in 2017 respectively (Figure 3).

Hotspots of studies on exosomes
Keywords used in the 1852 papers were analyzed
through VOSviewer. As shown in Figure 4A, the 150
keywords (defined as being used more than 45 times
within titles and abstracts in all of articles) were classified
to four clusters: “clinical study”, “interaction related
research”, “immunity related research” and “tumor related
research”. Among the “interaction related research”
cluster, keywords used in the publications of exosome
were listed as follows: RNA (746 times), mRNA (384
times), complex (368 times). For the immunity related
research, the primary keywords were as follows: mouse

(1489 times), response (437 times), T cell (348 times).
For the clinical study, the main keywords were as follows:
patient (607 times), biomarker (426 times), plasma (243
times). For the tumor related research, the keywords were
as follows: miRNA (643 times), proliferation (314 times),
and metastasis (209 times) (Supplementary Table 2).
In Figure 4B, VOSViewer applied colors to key
words based upon when they appeared in literature for
the average time. Key words in blue color appeared
early, and key words in red color appeared recently.
In early stage of exosome research, immune response
(cluster 3, the average appearing year (AAY) of
keywords is 2013.0) and intracellular interaction (cluster
2, AAY is 2012.9) were the main hotspots. Recent trend
showed that in tumor related research (cluster 4, AAY
is 2014.1), “stem cell” and “drug resistance” appeared
in 2015 and 2014 as keywords for 135 and 63 times
respectively, and in clinical study (cluster 1, AAY is
2013.7), “serum exosome” was the recent keyword for
67 times and it was appeared in 2014.

research. In addition, China ranked second in total number
of articles for many years, but sixth in citation frequency
and forth in H-index. England, France and Sweden had
fewer publications than that of China, but their citation
frequency and H-index were higher than that of China.
This suggested that more efforts should be taken to raise
the influence of Chinese research.
Additionally, there was a rapid growth of
publications related to exosome research from 2007 to
2016 all over the world. The time curves showed that there
might be more publications in this field in next years. The
number of publications in recent years rapidly surpasses
the total number of publications in the past.
French institutes were the leading organizations
on exosome research in the quantity. There were four
French institutes on the top 15 institutes list. However,
the most productive institution was Harvard University.
Meanwhile, three American were on the list, as well as
three Chinese institutes. The reason why the United States
had the most publications in this field was that it had the
most powerful institutions around the world.
It is of note that the Journals PLoS ONE has been
far ahead with 103 articles, additionally Journal of
Biological Chemistry, Scientific Reports and Oncotarget
were the main journals involved in publishing exosome
papers. Moreover, it indicated that future development
within exosome would likely be released within the
aforementioned journals.
In terms of authors and publications, Gabrielsson

response and cancer immunotherapy of exosome [19, 20].
Zhang H.G. focused on the communications of cells by
exosome [21, 22]. The articles of Conti E. were mainly
related to the effect of RNA in exosome [23, 24]. These
scientists were leaders in the exosome research, and their
studies may still have a huge impact on exosome research
in future and help design our own experiments. They are
excellent candidates for cooperation.

In Figure 4 A and B, we can find that the emphasis
of exosome research has shifted mainly from basic studies
to clinical studies in the recent years. It is in accordance
with the law of the development of a new discipline and
translational medicine. As the rudimentary knowledge
of the exosome was recognized, its application has then
been followed for illumination. For clinical studies, the
exosome was used mainly for diagnosis as a biomarker
from the serum of patients. We believed that exosome
might be also a treatment agent in the future. As a result,
the development of researches on exosomes is very
fast, and the translational research might be the next
breakthrough point.

Research focuses on exosomes
Articles that were cited the most on exosome
were of regarded as the fundamental basis for further
studies. The details of top 10 cited studies were
shown in Table 2. In the cluster of “interaction related
researches”, “RNA” (746 times, averagely appeared in
2013) and “mRNA” (384 times, averagely appeared in
2014) were the most used. The article titled “Exosomemediated transfer of mRNAs and microRNAs is a
novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells”
was the most cited for 665 times. It was published in
Nature Cell Biology in 2007 [3]. The article found that
exosomes contain both mRNA and microRNA, which
can be delivered to another cell, and can be functional
in this new location. For the latest hotspots, “stem
cell” (2015.0), “drug resistance” (2015.0) and “MCF”
(2014.9, michigan cancer foundation-7 in human breast
adenocarcinoma cell line) were averagely appeared the
most recently.

Strengths and limitations
Papers on exosome evaluated in this study were
reviewed from the Web of Science (WoS) database of
Science Citation Index Expanded journals. The data analysis
was relatively comprehensive and objective. However, there
are some limitations. Papers in non-English languages may
be not included in the database and may have excluded
important non-English research studies in exosome. Other
databases were not analyzed such as Scopus, Google Scholar
or PubMed, since WoS has gone a step further in presenting
metadata lists, including author, source, year, document,
countries and institutions types. Secondly, there were
still differences between the real research conditions and
bibliometric analysis results, since some recent published

48467

papers do not have high citation frequency. Thirdly, the
global analysis was not adjusted for economic condition,
population size, technology progress and other factors. Last,
though all searches were conducted on January 10, 2017 to
avoid bias due to the updating of the database for year 2016
since the database is still open for new data. However, we
think the database had included the vast majority of articles
published in 2016 and the additional small amount of new
data might not change the conclusion.

Bibliometric indicators were extracted from the data,
including publication number, citation frequency, relative
research interest, H-index [25, 26], and so on. The relative
research interest was designed as the quantity of weighted
publications per year divided by the number of publications
across all disciplines per year [27]. H-index is calculated
as a measure of scientific research impact that reflects both
the number of publications and the number of citations per
publication: a scholar has published H papers, each of which
has been cited in other papers at least H times [28].

CONCLUSION

Statistical methods

This study helps scientists master the trends of
exosome research. The number of publications of exosomes
will grow rapidly in the near future. The United States made
the largest contribution in the exosome research. Though
quantity of China ranked No.2, the quality and influence still
require improvements. PLoS ONE and J Biol Chem were
with the most relating publications. Gabrielsson S., Zhang
H.G. and Conti E. may be good candidates for collaborative
research in this field. All publications can be divided into 4
clusters. In the relatively new “tumor related” cluster, “stem
cell”, “drug resistance” and “MCF” may be the latest hot
spots, and related researches may be pioneers to lead this
field in the next few years.

GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Prism Software Inc.,
San Diego, California) was used to analyze the time trend of
the publications. The model: f(x) = ax3+bx2+cx+d was used
to calculate the cumulative volume and to predict future
trend of papers in this field. Symbol x represents the year,
and f(x) was the cumulative volume of paper by the year.
VOSviewer
(Leiden
University,
Leiden,
Netherlands) was used to analyze the relations among
highly cited references and productive authors. It is
commonly used for mapping and clustering of co-citation
network analysis. It also clusters citation terms and
portrays the key words by color. The density of occurrence
of information is portrayed by the size of the circle [29].
