Abstract
Tamoxifen is widely used to treat estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Recent ﬁndings that tamoxifen
and its derivative 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) can exert estrogen receptor–independent cytotoxic effects have
prompted the initiation of clinical trials to evaluate its use in estrogen receptor–negative malignancies. For
example, tamoxifen and OHT exert cytotoxic effects in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST)
where estrogen is not involved. In this study, we gained insights into the estrogen receptor–independent
cytotoxic effects of OHT by studying how it kills MPNST cells. Although caspases were activated following
OHT treatment, caspase inhibition provided no protection from OHT-induced death. Rather, OHT-induced
death in MPNST cells was associated with autophagic induction and attenuated by genetic inhibition of
autophagic vacuole formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that OHT stimulated autophagic degradation of K-Ras, which is critical for survival of MPNST cells. Similarly, we found that OHT induced K-Ras
degradation in breast, colon, glioma, and pancreatic cancer cells. Our ﬁndings describe a novel mechanism of
autophagic death triggered by OHT in tumor cells that may be more broadly useful clinically in cancer
treatment. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4395–405. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The triphenylethylene compound tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used
as the ﬁrst-line treatment for estrogen receptor–positive
breast cancer (1). While its principal target is the estrogen
receptor (2), tamoxifen, at micromolar concentrations,
exerts cytotoxic effects that are not reversed by estrogen
addition (3). In fact, multiple non–estrogen receptormediated mechanisms have been implicated in death
induced by tamoxifen and its hydroxylated derivative 4hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). These mechanisms include
changes in intracellular calcium (4); modulation of protein
kinase C (PKC; refs. 5, 6); changes in calmodulin activity (7);
and signaling though mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK; ref. 8). The diverse target range of tamoxifen and
its estrogen receptor-independent effects have prompted its
inclusion in clinical trials for multiple solid tumor types
including estrogen receptor-negative malignancies (9, 10).
In patients with largely inoperable and recurrent malignant
gliomas, there seems to be a consistent relationship
between higher doses of tamoxifen and higher radiographic

response rates and longer survival (11). Tamoxifen has also
been shown to augment the effects of cisplatin (12). However, a meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials for metastatic
melanoma reveals no signiﬁcant change in the survival rates
following tamoxifen treatment (13). Currently, there are
ongoing trials using tamoxifen in combination with chemotherapy for stage 3 melanoma and metastatic bladder
cancer.
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are
aggressive sarcomas that have a poor prognosis, in part
because no effective chemotherapeutic options are available
(14, 15). MPNSTs are the most common malignancy associated with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1; ref. 16). As the
NF1 gene codes for neuroﬁbromin, a Ras GTPase-activating
protein (GAP), loss of this gene results in Ras hyperactivation in NF1-associated tumor types (17). Recently, we
showed that tamoxifen could potently inhibit MPNST
growth in vivo (18). While MPNST cell lines express estrogen
receptors, ablation of these receptors had no effect on OHTinduced cytotoxicity, indicating an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism of action. Therefore, the overall goal of
this study was to delineate the mechanism of OHT-induced
cytotoxicity in MPNST cells.
OHT has been reported to induce apoptosis in tumor cells
through activation of multiple upstream pathways. However,
in addition to apoptotic features, cells dying in response to
OHT treatment also display large-scale autophagic vacuole
(AV) accumulation, suggesting a possible role for autophagy
in the regulation of OHT-induced death (19, 20). Autophagy
is a cellular catabolic pathway that targets long-lived proteins and cellular content for degradation and mediates

their recycling. Therapy-induced autophagy has been previously implicated in the regulation of cancer cell survival (21).
It can play a prosurvival role and mediate resistance to
therapy (22–25). Alternatively, autophagy can initiate and
directly cause cell death (26). However, the precise mechanism by which therapy-induced autophagy causes cell
death is poorly deﬁned.
In this study, we show that OHT-induced death of MPNST
cells is mediated by autophagy induction, not caspasedependent apoptosis. This is achieved, at least in part,
through degradation of K-Ras, a critical prosurvival protein
previously identiﬁed as a regulator of tamoxifen sensitivity
(27). Interestingly, the Ras pathway has been implicated as a
determinant of the clinical effectiveness of tamoxifen therapy in patients with breast cancer (28). Our ﬁndings identify
a novel mechanism for autophagy mediated death and also a
previously unreported mechanism for OHT-induced cytotoxicity in tumor cells. This study also sheds light on the role
of Ras stability in mediating tumor cell response to tamoxifen treatment.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and other reagents
Primary antibodies were obtained from the following
sources: H-Ras and N-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.);
Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185),
p44/42, phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), S6, and phosphoS6 ribosomal protein, eIF4E, 4E-BP1, and GAPDH (Cell
Signaling Technology); EGFR (Millipore); LC3 (Abgent); and
K-Ras (ABD Serotec). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(Bio-Rad) and horse anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology)
and IR dye anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Li-Cor
Biosciences).
Cycloheximide, rapamycin, and 3-methyladenine (3-MA)
were purchased from Sigma. BOC-aspartyl (Ome)-ﬂuoromethyl ketone (BAF) was purchased from MP Biomedicals
and baﬁlomycin B1 (BafB1) was from A.G. Scientiﬁc. OHT was
obtained from Enzo Life Sciences, hygromycin B was from
Cellgro, and doxycycline HCL was from Fisher Scientiﬁc.
Cell cultures
We have previously described the source of T265-2c, ST8814, and the 90-8 cells, the human NF1-derived MPNST lines
used in this study (18, 29). The identity of these cell lines was
routinely veriﬁed according to the speciﬁcations outlined in
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Technical Bulletin 8. Brieﬂy, morphology and doubling times of cells was
routinely assessed and the identity of cells was veriﬁed by
short-tandem repeat analysis. Cells were also regularly tested
for Mycoplasma infection. SK-BR-3, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells and T84 colon cancer cells were obtained
from the ATCC. The colon cancer cell lines Caco2, HCT116,
LoVo, HCT-15, RKO, and DLD1 were kindly provided by Dr.
Upender Manne [Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, AL]. The glioma
cancer cell lines U87, LN229, and LN308 were a kind gift from

Dr. Yancey Gillespie (UAB Division of Neurosurgery) and the
pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 were generously provided by Dr. Boris Pasche (UAB Division of Hematology and Oncology). Pyrosequencing was conducted to conﬁrm the K-Ras mutational status of the cell lines.
All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM10; DMEM; Sigma) containing 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma), and 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and were incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere.
Cells were plated onto uncoated 48-well plates at a density
of 15,000/well and in 100 mm dishes at a density of 800,000
cells/dish. Cultures were used in experiments 24 hours postplating. Drug treatments were carried out in the same media.
Cell lines stably transduced with lentiviruses expressing
shRNAs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
tetracycline-free FBS (Serum Source International) and hygromycin B (50 mg/mL). During experiments requiring shRNA
induction, cells were plated in media without hygromycin B.
Twenty-four hours after plating, 2 mg/mL doxycycline HCL was
added to induce shRNA expression. Seventy-two hours postinduction, cells were transferred to serum-free media and drug
treatments were initiated.
Construction of cell lines stably transduced with
lentiviral vectors
Lentiviral vectors carrying cassettes encoding green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) and miR-like shRNAs under the control
of a doxycycline HCL -inducible promoter were constructed
using pSLIK vectors (30). Oligonucleotides encoding K-Ras
shRNA sequences were designed using the RNAi Codex algorithm. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and
ligated to BfuAI digested pen_TTGmiRc2. The resulting plasmids were recombined with pSLIK-hygro vector using LR
Clonase per the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Three lentiviral vectors targeting distinct K-Ras sequences were constructed (pSLC751, pSLC752, and pSLC753
targeting nucleotides 508–530, 224—255, and 406–427 of
NM_004985.2, respectively). To identify possible nonspeciﬁc
activation of RNA-induced silencing complex, a lentiviral
vector was also constructed that encodes a shRNA targeting
a sequence not present in the human genome (pSLC727). To
make lentivirus, pSLIK vectors were transfected into 293FT
cells together with helper plasmids (pPLP1, pPLP2, and pVSVg)
using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's recommendations. Seven-two hours posttransfection,
virus-containing media was collected and stored at 80 C
until use.
To stably transduce lentiviral vectors into T265-2c cells, viral
supernatant and 6 mg/mL Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) was
added to cells plated in DMEM10 medium in 6-well plates.
Twenty-four hours later, virus-containing medium was
removed and replaced with tetracycline-free DMEM10. Forty-eight to 72 hours posttransduction, each well was split into
three 100-mm dishes and selection with hygromycin begun.
Colonies, which arose approximately 2 weeks later, were picked
and individually expanded. Lines with appropriate regulation of
the shRNA/GFP cassette were initially identiﬁed by ﬁnding that

they had no GFP ﬂuorescence in the absence of doxycycline
HCL and strong GFP signals following doxycycline HCL induction. To verify that shRNA and GFP expression in the selected
lines was appropriately regulated and to establish the optimal
conditions for ablation of K-Ras expression, transformants
were challenged with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/mL doxycycline
HCL for 72 hours. Lysates of cells stimulated with varying
doxycycline HCL concentrations were then immunoblotted
and probed with antibodies recognizing GFP and K-Ras.
Cell viability and in vitro caspase cleavage assays
The calcein-AM conversion assay used to measure cell
viability was conducted as previously described (31). Caspase
activation was assessed by the in vitro caspase-3 cleavage assay
using the chemical substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC; BIOMOL).
Western blotting and 7methyl-GTP afﬁnity
chromatography
Whole-cell lysates were prepared by removing the media,
washing the cells with PBS, scraping them off and pelleting the
cells by centrifugation at 1,750 rpm for 10 minutes. Cell pellets
were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 3 (Sigma). Lysates were
vortexed, clariﬁed, and stored at 80 C. Protein of 40 mg was
immunoblotted per our previously described protocol (32). All
primary antibodies were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of
1:1,000 except GAPDH and EGFR (1:5,000). Immunoreactive
species were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
7
Methyl-GTP afﬁnity chromatography was conducted as
previously described (33). Signals were detected using ECL
Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare) and the
Odyssey Infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences).
RNAi
Atg7 siRNA was purchased from Thermo Scientiﬁc and
reconstituted according to manufacturers' instructions. Cells
were plated in DMEM10 and transfected 24 hours postplating
using X-tremeGene siRNA transfection reagent (Roche) with a
ratio of 5:2 (transfection reagent:oligos). The next day, fresh
media was added to cells and after 72 hours, cells were used in
experiments.
Statistics
All data points represent mean  SD. n ¼ 6 wells for all
experiments. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times
unless stated otherwise. Representative data are shown. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni posthoc test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

centrations of OHT have been reported to trigger apoptosis,
marked by activation of effector caspases such as 3, 6, and 7
(34). Consequently, we ﬁrst examined the possibility that the
death induced by OHT in MPNST cells was apoptotic in nature.
To determine whether OHT treatment activated effector caspases in MPNST cells, cells were treated with 8 to 12 mmol/L
OHT and, after 48 hours of treatment, the cleavage of DEVDAMC, a pharmacologic substrate for active effector caspases,
was measured in cell lysates. These OHT concentrations were
selected as they inhibit the proliferation and survival of breast
carcinoma cells and are physiologically relevant to concentrations achieved in patients (35). We found that OHT-treated
cells showed a concentration-dependent increase in caspase
3-like enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A). However, a 1-hour pretreatment with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor failed to attenuate OHT-induced death (Fig. 1B). We conclude that caspasedependent apoptosis is not the sole mediator of OHT-induced
cytotoxicity in MPNST cells.
OHT induces an autophagic death in MPNST cells
In other cell types, OHT treatment induces apoptotic
features together with large-scale accumulation of AVs
(19, 20). Further, a prodeath role has been ascribed to
OHT-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells (19). We
therefore asked whether OHT triggered the induction of
autophagy in MPNST cells. Whole-cell lysates prepared from
OHT-treated cultures were probed for changes in levels of
LC3 II, a surrogate marker for AV detection. LC3 II, the
cleaved and lipidated form of the microtubule associated
protein light chain 3 (LC3 or LC3 I) inserts itself in the outer
membrane of AVs (36). Relative to untreated cells, OHTtreated cells showed a dramatic increase in steady-state levels
of AVs (Fig. 1C). LC3 II can accumulate in response to
increased autophagy induction and/or decreased AV degradation. Therefore, autophagic ﬂux was measured in control
and OHT-treated cells using BafB1, which inhibits vacuolar
ATPase, a molecule active in the late stage of autophagy (37,
38). OHT-treated cells displayed increased autophagic ﬂux,
indicating that the increase in steady-state AV levels was due,
at least in part, to increased autophagy induction by OHT
(Fig. 1D). To assess the functional signiﬁcance of this phenomenon, we next inhibited the initiation of autophagy by
transfecting cells with siRNA targeting Atg7, a critical regulator of AV formation (Fig. 1E). We found that Atg7 knockdown partially protected MPNST cells from OHT-induced
death (Fig. 1F). We conclude that OHT triggers autophagic
death in MPNST cells.
OHT triggers K-Ras degradation
Autophagy plays a critical role in the turnover and recycling
of long-lived proteins. Our ﬁnding that OHT-induced autophagy mediates death raises the question of whether accelerated
degradation of key prosurvival proteins through the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway mediates OHT-induced
death. A recent genome-wide screen in tamoxifen-treated
breast cancer cells identiﬁed a number of candidate survival
promoting genes present in these cells (27). These genes
included the neuroﬁbromin-regulated small GTP-binding

protein K-Ras. Notably, K-Ras is the only neuroﬁbromin-regulated Ras isoform that is targeted to lysosomes for degradation (39). Considered together, these observations led us to
hypothesize that OHT triggers autophagic death in MPNST
cells by decreasing levels of K-Ras.
We ﬁrst examined the effects of OHT treatment on K-Ras
protein levels in T265-2c cells. Immunoblot analyses showed
a concentration-dependent decrease in levels of K-Ras (Fig.
2A). In contrast, levels of H- and N-Ras, which are degraded
by proteasomes, remained unaltered following exposure to
OHT (Fig. 2B and C). To determine if the decrease in K-Ras
levels was due to accelerated degradation, cells were pretreated for 1 hour with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis
inhibitor. In the absence of new protein synthesis, a timedependent decrease in K-Ras levels was observed in cells

treated with both cycloheximide and OHT relative to those
treated with cycloheximide alone, indicating that OHT
mediates accelerated degradation of K-Ras (Fig. 2D). To
determine whether OHT treatment globally inhibited protein translation, we examined the effect of this treatment on
mTOR activity. Levels of phosphorylated S6 kinase, a downstream target of mTOR, did not signiﬁcantly change 48 hours
following OHT treatment (when K-Ras levels are found to
decrease), whereas levels of phosphorylated S6 kinase were
markedly decreased in cells treated with the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin (Fig. 2E). Cap-dependent translation can also be
inhibited by an association between eukaryotic translation
initiation factor (eIF4E) and another mTOR target, eIF4E
binding protein (4EBP1; ref. 40). Coimmunoprecipitation
experiments in vehicle- and OHT-treated cells showed that

OHT-triggered K-Ras degradation downregulates MAPK
signaling
Several studies have indicated that activated Ras mediates
tamoxifen resistance via MAPK activation. Therefore, we
examined whether the level of K-Ras degradation observed in
OHT-treated MPNST cells is sufﬁcient to inhibit Ras-dependent MAPK activation in these cells. Immunoblot analyses
showed that the levels of phosphorylated forms of JNK and

there was no increase in binding of eIF4E and 4EBP1 in these
cells, further indicating that OHT treatment did not affect
global protein synthesis whereas synthesis was decreased by
amino acid starvation (Fig. 2F). In addition, steady-state
mRNA levels of K-Ras remained unchanged in OHT-treated
cells, indicating that the decrease in K-Ras levels was not due
to blocked transcription (data not shown). Considered
jointly, these observations indicate that the decrease in KRas levels following OHT treatment is due to increased
degradation rather than alterations in the transcription or
translational machinery of the cells.

inhibition
Our previous study indicated that OHT-induced death of
MPNST cells is estrogen receptor independent (18). Consequently, we next attempted to delineate an estrogen receptor-independent mechanism by which OHT primes K-Ras for
accelerated degradation. Earlier work has shown that
tamoxifen directly binds to and antagonizes the calcium
regulated proteins calmodulin and PKC (41–43). Further,
calmodulin and PKC are known to differentially modulate
the functionality and localization of K-Ras on the plasma
membrane (44). These observations led us to hypothesize
that inhibition of calmodulin and/or PKC promotes K-Ras
degradation. We tested this hypothesis by assessing whether
inhibitors of calmodulin or PKC could mimic the OHTinduced degradation of K-Ras. The calmodulin inhibitor

Inhibition of autophagy initiation blocks OHT-induced
decrease in K-Ras levels
To determine if K-Ras degradation in OHT-treated MPNST
cells was mediated by autophagy, we blocked the early stage
of autophagy with 3-MA, a class III PI3K inhibitor, and Atg7
knockdown and examined the effect this had on K-Ras levels.
A 1 hour pretreatment with 3-MA effectively blocked the
OHT-induced decrease in K-Ras levels (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atg7 prevented the OHTmediated decrease in K-Ras levels, whereas the nontargeting
control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we conclude
that OHT triggers K-Ras degradation through the autophagy
pathway.
OHT-induces cytotoxicity through autophagy-mediated
K-Ras degradation
To establish that OHT triggers autophagic death in MPNST
cells via K-Ras degradation, we assessed the effects of
directly depleting K-Ras levels in OHT-treated cells. T2652c MPNST cells stably transduced with lentiviral vectors
expressing either K-Ras (T53N) or control (T27A) shRNAs
under a doxycycline-responsive promoter were generated.
We found that cells expressing K-Ras shRNA showed
increased sensitivity to OHT in the presence of doxycycline
(Fig. 4C). In contrast, the addition of doxycycline had no
effect on cells expressing control shRNA (Fig. 4D). This is in
keeping with previously published reports indicating that

W13 had no effect on steady-state K-Ras levels (Fig. 3C).
However, PKC inhibition using R031-8220 triggered a
decrease in K-Ras levels under steady state as well as in
the absence of new protein synthesis using cycloheximide,
indicating that similar to OHT, PKC inhibition also induces
accelerated K-Ras degradation (Fig. 3C and D). We conclude
that OHT-triggered K-Ras degradation may be a function of
its ability to antagonize PKC activity.

Figure 3. OHT treatment inhibits
MAPK signaling. Whole-cell
lysates from OHT-treated cells
show a time-dependent decrease
in levels of phospho-p44/42 (A) and
phospho-JNK (B). C, treatment
with the PKC inhibitor R031-8220
(10 mmol/L, 24 hours) and OHT
(10 mmol/L, 24 hours) caused a
decrease, whereas the calmodulin
inhibitor W13 (15 mg/mL, 24 hours)
had no effect on steady-state
K-Ras levels. D, whole-cell lysates
from R031-8220–treated cells
showed a time-dependent
decrease in K-Ras levels in the
presence of the protein synthesis
inhibitor CHX (100 mmol/L, 1 hour
pretreatment).

K-Ras plays a prosurvival role in the context of tamoxifeninduced death (27). Thus, we conclude that OHT triggers
death in MPNST cells, at least in part, via autophagy mediated K-Ras degradation.
OHT also triggers EGFR degradation
Next, we examined whether OHT also affects the stability
of membrane-associated proteins such as EGFR that have
been shown to colocalize with K-Ras en route to degradation
(39). In response to growth factor stimulation, K-Ras and
EGFR are internalized and occupy the same signaling scaffolds followed by degradation. Therefore, we tested the
possibility that in addition to K-Ras, OHT might also trigger
a decrease in EGFR stability and observed a time-dependent
decrease in levels of EGFR in the presence of cycloheximide
indicating that this decrease was due to accelerated degradation (Fig. 5A). Given the relevance of EGFR to malignant
gliomas, we assessed the effects of OHT on EGFR levels in
multiple glioma and MPNST cell lines and observed a
concentration-dependent decrease in all cell lines (Fig.
5B–E). Similar results were obtained for the breast cancer
line MCF7 (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that, in addition
to K-Ras, OHT also inﬂuences EGFR stability.
OHT triggers K-Ras degradation in multiple tumor types
Finally, we wanted to determine whether the OHT effects
on K-Ras that we observed in MPNST cells occurred more
generally in other tumor types. We consistently observed an
OHT-induced decrease in K-Ras levels across a panel of cell
lines derived from multiple tumor types (Fig. 6A–I). Given
the clinical relevance of tamoxifen to breast cancer, multiple
breast cancer cell lines were also examined. We observed
that OHT triggered a concentration-dependent decrease in
K-Ras in the SK-BR-3 and MCF7 but not in MDA-MB-231
cells (Figs. 6H and I and 7A). Previously, mutations in Ras
isoforms have been shown to inﬂuence their ubiquitination

patterns and stability (45). This led us to test the hypothesis
that OHT-induced K-Ras degradation may be affected by the
mutational status of K-Ras.
Consistent with previously published studies, our pyrosequencing analysis revealed that while the SK-BR-3 and
MCF7 cells harbor a wild-type K-Ras, the MDA-MB-231 cells
have a mutation in codon 13 (G13D). To assess whether cell
lines harboring a mutant K-Ras (G13D) are relatively resistant to K-Ras degradation, we tested multiple colon cancer
cell lines as the G13D mutation is commonly associated
with colon cancer. We observed that OHT triggered a
concentration-dependent decrease in K-Ras in the colon
cancer cell lines Caco2 and RKO, which have a wild-type KRas (Fig. 6F and G). However, the cell lines DLD1, HCT-15,
HCT 116, and LoVo that bear a G13D mutation were
relatively resistant to K-Ras degradation (Fig. 7B–E). These
results indicate that while OHT can target K-Ras for degradation in multiple tumor types, the effects of OHT on KRas stability may be inﬂuenced by the mutation status of KRas. However, the colon cancer line T84 that also harbors a
G13D mutation did show a decrease in K-Ras levels following OHT addition, indicating that additional factors might

OHT treatment (Fig. 7F).

Discussion
The goal of this study was to identify the molecular
mechanisms that mediate estrogen receptor independent
OHT–induced cytotoxicity in MPNST cells (18). This study
offers evidence to support the hypothesis that the autophagic pathway is a critical mediator of OHT-induced death.
Brieﬂy, we show that caspases are activated following OHT
treatment but are not the primary mediators of death. OHT
triggers an increase in autophagic ﬂux thereby impacting the
autophagy pathway. Blocking autophagy initiation attenuates OHT-induced death, indicating a prodeath role for
autophagy in this setting. Furthermore, we have shown that
through its inhibitory effects on PKC, OHT primes K-Ras for
degradation in an autophagy-dependent manner. Hence,
autophagy mediates death in OHT-treated cells, at least in
part, through accelerated K-Ras degradation. This ﬁnding
was extended to other tumor types and it was observed
that OHT-mediated K-Ras degradation is affected by the
mutational status of K-Ras. Thus, this study provides an

insight into the role of altered protein turnover by autophagy
as a death mechanism.
The role of therapy-induced autophagy in cancer remains
paradoxical. It is now well accepted that in response to
various chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation, and targeted
therapeutics, dying cells display large-scale accumulation
of autophagic vacuoles (46). OHT is widely accepted as a
potent autophagy inducer. In keeping with this, we observed
an increase in autophagic ﬂux following OHT treatment.
This might result from the transient block in mTOR activity
that was observed 24 hours following OHT treatment. We
tested the role of OHT-induced autophagy by knocking
down Atg7 and observed signiﬁcant protection from
OHT-induced death, thus establishing a pro-death role for
autophagy.
Next, we attempted to delineate the underlying mechanism for autophagy-mediated death in the context of OHT.
While the scope of autophagy has expanded dramatically to
include diverse functions, the most basic role of autophagy
remains the turnover of long-lived proteins. There exists a
delicate balance between prosurvival and death-promoting
proteins in the cell. We hypothesized that autophagy can
regulate death by altering the rates of degradation of these
proteins and disrupting the existing balance. This may offer

an explanation for the context-dependent roles of autophagy
in response to different therapeutic agents. Accordingly, we
proposed that OHT-induced increase in autophagic ﬂux
might accelerate the degradation of K-Ras, a protein shown
to mediate resistance to tamoxifen-induced death (27). We
tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of OHT on
the rate of K-Ras degradation and observed accelerated
degradation in OHT-treated cells. Pharmacologic inhibition
using 3-MA and transient knockdown of Atg7 blocked the
OHT-induced decrease in K-Ras levels indicating that K-Ras
undergoes autophagic degradation. The functional relevance
of this observation was established by assessing the effects
of K-Ras degradation on downstream MAPK signaling.
Modulation of protein turnover by drug-induced autophagy
has not been previously established, thereby providing
us with new insights on the role of autophagy in mediating
death.
Next, we examined the possibility that OHT might specifically prime K-Ras for degradation through the autophagy
pathway. Tamoxifen is known to bind to calmodulin and PKC
and inhibit their functioning (47). Interestingly, PKC inhibition
could simulate the effects of OHT on K-Ras degradation giving
rise to the possibility that OHT might prime K-Ras for degradation through PKC inhibition. We also tested the possibility

that OHT triggers the degradation of additional prosurvival
proteins apart from K-Ras, especially other membrane-associated proteins. EGFR and its family members are constitutively activated in MPNST cells and knockdown of EGFR
signaling is associated with decreased proliferation and survival in MPNSTs cells thereby making it an attractive therapeutic target in this tumor type (29). We observed that similar
to K-Ras, EGFR underwent accelerated degradation. However,
it remains to be tested whether K-Ras and EGFR follow a
similar degradation path and/or are primed for degradation
through a similar upstream stimulus that alters membrane
dynamics.
To assess the relevance of our results to other tumor types,
we tested the ability of OHT to induce K-Ras and EGFR
degradation in cell lines derived from different tumor types.
In addition, we explored the possibility that mutations in K-Ras

can inﬂuence its degradation. This is an important consideration since K-Ras mutations underlie the pathogenesis of
several aggressive malignancies. We found that, unlike wildtype K-Ras, K-RasG13D was resistant to OHT-mediated degradation in nearly all cell lines tested. However, the results
obtained for the colon cancer line T84 (K-RasG13D), which
remained sensitive to OHT-induced K-Ras degradation, indicate that additional factors inﬂuence the stability of K-Ras
following OHT treatment.
In summary, the ﬁndings of this study reveal yet another
estrogen receptor-independent mechanism for OHT-induced
cell death. This article also unveils a novel mechanism for
autophagy mediated death and points toward the existence of
a mechanism by which mutant K-Ras might resist autophagic
degradation. Additional studies are now needed to examine the
clinical relevance of these ﬁndings.
