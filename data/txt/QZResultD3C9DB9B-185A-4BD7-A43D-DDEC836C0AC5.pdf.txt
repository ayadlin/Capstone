BACKGROUND. There have been few randomized studies of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine (GEM) in patients with resected pancreatic cancer.
METHODS. Patients with invasive ductal pancreatic cancer who underwent radical
surgery were enrolled and assigned to receive uracil/tegafur (UFT) and GEM together (GU) or GEM alone (G). GEM was administrated at a dosage of 1 g/m2
intravenously weekly 3 of 4 weeks and UFT at a dosage of 200 mg/day orally continuously. Eligibility included resection status 0 or 1, and no previous chemo- or/
and radiation therapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and
secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and toxicity.

RESULTS. Between 2002 and 2005, 100 patients were randomized into the 2 arms
of the trial (50 patients to GU and 50 to G). One patient in the G group was
found to be ineligible. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2
groups. With a median observation period of 21 months, the 1- and 3-year DFS
rates were 50.0% and 17.7% in the GU group and 49.0% and 21.6% in the G
group, respectively. The median OS was 21.2 months in the GU group and 29.8
months in the G group. Toxicity was minor and acceptable, less than grade 4 in

both groups.

CONCLUSIONS. Postoperative GEM-based adjuvant chemotherapy was safe and
well tolerated. However, addition of UFT with GEM did not improve DFS as compared with GEM alone. Further clinical trial resources for adjuvant chemotherapy

P

ancreatic cancer is 1 of the most lethal human
malignancies and continues to be a major
unsolved health problem. It is the fourth leading
cause of death from cancer in the United States1 and
the fifth in Japan.2 Despite the recent advances in
the management of the disease, long-term survival
remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of about
5%.1,2
Surgery is the only means to obtain a cure for
patients with pancreatic cancer. Even with advanced
cancer, the best survival rates are achieved after surgical resection.3,4 However, because of the high incidence of recurrences, the 5-year survival rate of
patients who undergo resection remains low,
approximately 20%.3,5 Extended resections do not
improve survival, as demonstrated in several randomized trials.6-8 These facts indicate that, to achieve
long-term disease control in patients with pancreatic
cancer, it is important to develop an effective multidisciplinary therapy, a combination of surgery with
other nonsurgical therapies such as radiation and
chemotherapy.
In fact, it has been clearly shown that adjuvant
chemotherapy prolongs postoperative survival in several types of malignancies, including breast,9 colorectal,10 and gastric cancer.11 To date, several
randomized studies of adjuvant therapy have been
conducted in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG)
first reported, in a multicenter randomized-controlled study, that adjuvant chemoradiation therapy
prolonged the postoperative survival of patients with
resected pancreatic cancer.12 However, the results of
several subsequent trials, in which 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy was applied, were inconsistent.13-17 Although Stocken et al showed by metaanalysis that 5-FU-based chemotherapy is an effective adjuvant treatment in pancreatic cancer, the survival rate of patients with adjuvant chemotherapy
was still poor, with a median survival time of only
19.0 months.18
Since Burris et al first reported an improvement
in survival and clinical benefits with gemcitabine, an
analog of deoxycytidine, compared with 5-FU for
advanced pancreatic cancer,19 gemcitabine has
become a major first-line reagent for patients with
unresectable pancreatic cancer. The same year, when
they published their paper showing the benefits of
gemcitabine therapy, the German group started a
randomized controlled trial (CONKO-001) to estimate
the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine for patients with resected pancreatic cancer,
and recently reported that it significantly delayed the
development of recurrent diseases.20 However, there

2449

exist only a few other trials of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine for patients with resected pancreatic cancer.
With this background, we planned a similarly
randomized trial to evaluate the survival benefit of
gemcitabine adjuvant therapy in combination with
another reagent. For this purpose, we used tegafur/
uracil (UFT). UFT is an oral fluoropyrimidine agent
composed of tegafur and uracil at 1:4 fixed molar ratio to increase the tumor concentration and antineoplastic activity of 5-FU.21 In vitro experiments
showed that pretreatment with 5-FU increased the
cell intensity and toxicity of gemcitabine by synergistic activity.22 Furthermore, the combination of gemcitabine and UFT has already shown a high tumor
response rate in patients with lung cancer.23,24 It has
also been shown that a combination of capecitabine,
another prodrug of 5-FU, and gemcitabine increased
the survival rate of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer with good performance status compared with those produced by gemcitabine treatment
alone.25
In 2002, we initiated a multicenter randomized
controlled phase II trial to estimate the possible efficacy of a UFT combination with gemcitabine, compared with gemcitabine alone, for adjuvant
chemotherapy in patients with resected pancreatic
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Design
Patient recruitment for the multicenter randomized
phase II trial was begun in May 2002 and was closed
in December 2005 in 19 Japanese institutions.
Patients who had pancreatic cancer histologically
verified as invasive ductal carcinoma and who had
undergone macroscopic complete resection were enrolled. Patients with carcinoma in situ were excluded.
Patients with prior radiation or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or with distant metastasis except minimal
para-aortic lymph node metastasis were excluded
from this study. Other eligibility criteria included:
being aged 20 years or older and 79 years or younger
at the time of registration; absence of active infection, significant cardiac disease, brain disease, and/
or active malignancies other than pancreatic cancer;
and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatologic
function (leukocytes 4000/mm3, hemoglobin 9.0
g/dL, platelets 1 3 105/mm3, creatinine 1.53
upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin 3 3
ULN, transaminase 2.5 3 ULN). The protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at each
study site, and all patients provided written informed

consent. The patients were registered within 10
weeks of surgery and were then randomly assigned
to 1 of 2 groups: adjuvant chemotherapy with a
gemcitabine alone (GEM) group and a gemcitabine
1 UFT (GEM 1 UFT) group. All patients were
diagnosed as free of recurrences by computed
tomography postoperatively before enrollment. Randomization was performed at the coordinating center
of the trial using a computer-generated procedure.
Standard surgical procedures were used depending
on the extent of tumor involvement and according to
institutional policy. Handling and histological examination of the resected specimens were carried out
according to the recommendations of the Japan Pancreatic Society.26 During the study, vital signs and
complete blood counts were obtained weekly. Additional 4-week assessments included serum biochemistry and adverse events. Imaging by computed
tomography or ultrasound was carried out every
3 months. Diagnosis of recurrence was made based
on the imaging findings. Treatment after recurrence
was not defined.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy was started within 1 week of randomization. Patients in the GEM group received adjuvant chemotherapy of at least 4 cycles of
gemcitabine every 4 weeks. Each chemotherapy cycle
consisted of 3 weekly infusions of gemcitabine at
1000 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion during a
30-minute period, followed by a 1-week pause.
Patients in the GEM 1 UFT group received UFT at
200 mg/day continuously in addition to gemcitabine
with the same protocol as the GEM group. Patients
who received 4 cycles of treatment were considered
to have completed the therapy. Patients were allowed
to continue the same therapy after 4 cycles. Toxicity
was assessed according to National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
versions 2.0 (2004) and 3.0 (2004). If the patient
showed grade 3 or worse hematologic adverse events,
serum transaminase level >2.5-fold ULN, serum total
bilirubin level >3.0 mg/dL, or other adverse clinical
events of grade 2 or worse, chemotherapy was
stopped until recovery from these criteria. The dose
of gemcitabine was reduced to 800 mg/m2 in the following cycles and to 600 mg/m2 if additional adverse
events occurred. In the GEM 1 UFT group, UFT was
stopped if adverse events occurred even after a
reduction of gemcitabine to 800 mg/m2, with gemcitabine further reduced to 600 mg/m2 in the following
cycles. Chemotherapy was discontinued if adverse
events within these criteria occurred regardless of

whether the gemcitabine dose had been reduced to
600 mg/m2.

Statistics
The primary endpoint of the study was the 1-year
disease-free survival rate. Secondary endpoints
included toxicity and overall survival. The duration
of disease-free and overall survival was calculated
from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence
and death, respectively. Efficacy analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier
technique, and the log-rank test was used to assess
differences in survival estimates among the groups.
The univariate analysis was done using the Cox proportional hazards model. Assuming a 1-year diseasefree survival rate of 40% in the GEM arm, the present
study was designed to enroll more than 89 patients
to detect an absolute increase of at least 15% in the
GEM 1 UFT arm, with a significance level of 5%
with 90% power, and taking into consideration a
dropout rate of 25%. Data analysis was performed
using StatView version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Patients
Between May 2002 and December 2005, 100 patients
were recruited into the study from 19 institutions in
Japan. The patients were randomized to the GEM
group (n 5 50) and the GEM 1 UFT group (n 5 50)
(Fig. 1). One patient in the GEM group was
rated ineligible because of a histological diagnosis

30.0 days in the GEM 1 UFT group.

Treatment Data
All patients received at least 1 dose of gemcitabine.
The median number of the gemcitabine administrations for a patient was 12 times for the GEM group
and 14 times for the GEM 1 UFT group. Median
relative dose intensity within the first 4 cycles was

pleted 4 or more cycles of treatment. The reasons for
treatment discontinuation within 4 cycles in the
GEM group were recurrent disease (10 patients,
76.9%), adverse events (2 patients, 15.4%), and
patient’s wish (1 patient, 7.7%). In the GEM 1 UFT
group, the reasons were recurrent disease (5 patients,
25.0%), adverse events (11 patients, 55.0%), and
patient’s wish (4 patients, 20.0%).

Toxicity
Although the majority of the patients, especially
those in the GEM 1 UFT group, experienced minor
toxicity, no grade 4 or higher toxicities were observed
in either group (Table 3). Fifteen (30.6%) patients in
the GEM group and 12 (24.0%) patients in the GEM
1 UFT group experienced grade 3 toxicity, mainly
leukocytopenia. Two patients in the GEM group and
11 patients in the GEM 1 UFT group discontinued
treatment within 4 cycles because of repeated toxicities despite dose modification. All toxicities were reversible and resolved with conservative treatment
alone in all patients.
Efficacy
With a median observation period of 21 months
(range, 3 months to 57 months), recurrent disease
developed at comparable rates of 73.5% in the GEM
group (36 of 49 patients) and 78% in the GEM 1
UFT group (39 of 50 patients). The sites of recurrence were similar in both groups (GEM group and
GEM 1 UFT group); the local recurrence was
observed in 75.0% and 69.2% of patients, respectively. The number of patients with local recurrence
alone was 13 (36.1%) in the GEM group and 17
(43.6%) in the GEM 1 UFT group. The most frequent
primary site of distant metastasis was the liver, with
12 (33.3%) patients of the GEM group and 13 (33.3%)
patients of the GEM 1 UFT group. The estimated

In the randomized patients, 57 patients (26 in
the GEM group and 31 in the GEM 1 UFT group)
died because of recurrent disease; there were no
deaths attributed to any other causes in the observation period. The median overall survival time was
29.8 months in the GEM group and 21.2 months in
the GEM 1 UFT group. The estimated survival rates

at 1 and 3 years were 85.7% and 46.9% in the GEM

Prognostic Factors for Patients With

survival time of all 99 patients in this study was 12.0

survival rates were 49.5% and 19.5%, respectively
(Fig. 3A). The median overall survival time of those
patients was 24.1 months, and the estimated 1- and

3-year survival rates were 82.8% and 38.8%, respectively (Fig. 3B).
To assess the influence of prognostic factors, the
relationships between the survival outcomes and the
following variables were investigated: sex, age (63

years/>63 years), tumor location (head/body or tail),
International Union Against Cancer stage (IA-IIA/IIBIV), Japan Pancreas Society (JPS) stage (I-III/IVa, b),
operation time (444 minutes/>444 minutes), blood
loss during operation (920 mL/>920 mL), tumor
size (2 cm/>2 cm), nodal status (negative/positive),
para-aorta lymph node metastasis (negative/positive), tumor histology (poorly differentiated tubular
adenocarcinoma/other), and resection status (R0/
R1). We performed univariate analysis of these factors for disease-free and overall survival times.
Among these factors, only the JPS stage showed a
significant value for disease-free survival time
(hazard ratio, 0.473; 95% confidence interval; 0.2880.775; P 5 .003), and no factors exerted a significant
influence on overall survival time.
Because factors that are known to have prognostic value for survival such as nodal status and resection status did not show significant values on
univariate analysis, we performed a Kaplan-Meier
analysis of the disease-free and overall survival times
for all 99 patients, and categorized the outcome by
these factors. As shown in univariate analysis, there
were no significant differences between patients with
and without lymph node metastasis with respect to
disease-free and overall survival times (Fig. 3C, D).
Moreover, there were no significant differences
between patients with R0 and R1 resection with
respect to disease-free and overall survival times
(Fig. 3E, F).

DISCUSSION
For the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer,
even with advanced cancer, the best survival rates
are achieved after surgical resection.3,4 However,
because of the high recurrence rate, the prognosis of
the patient remains poor even after curative surgery.
This indicates that it is important to establish an
effective multidiscipline therapy for pancreatic cancer. In this study, we aimed to estimate the efficacy
of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine and
UFT for patients with resected pancreatic cancer.
Burris et al first reported in 1997 that gemcitabine improved the survival of patients with advanced
pancreatic cancer, with a median survival time of
5.65 months compared with 4.41 months for patients
treated with 5-FU.19 Since then, gemcitabine has
become the first-line chemotherapy for patients with
pancreatic cancer. Meanwhile, several randomized
studies have shown that 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the survival of patients with
resected pancreatic cancer.13,27 Therefore, we strongly
expected that adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcita-

bine would improve the survival of our patients. We
thus attempted in our phase II study to optimize the
efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy by combination
with gemcitabine and other agents.
We selected UFT as the agent to use in combination with gemcitabine. There were several reasons.
First, in vitro analysis showed that pretreatment of
pancreatic cancer cells with 5-FU increased the intracellular concentration of gemcitabine, suggesting
that UFT, a prodrug of 5-FU, might have the potential to supplement the therapeutic benefits of gemcitabine.22 Second, UFT, an oral fluoropyrimidine,
might be more convenient to administer than continuous 5-FU infusion, especially in an adjuvant setting. In addition, several groups had shown favorable
results from the use of a combination of gemcitabine
and UFT as a treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer.28,29
Our study showed that adjuvant chemotherapy
with gemcitabine, with or without UFT, could be carried out with acceptable safety. No grade 4 toxicities
were observed in any patients in either group, and
no patient died because of toxic events related to
adjuvant therapy. Grade 3 hematologic toxicities
were observed in about 30% of the patients in
both groups. Leukocytopenia was most frequently
observed, as shown in the CONKO-001 study.20
Although a high incidence of leukocytopenia from
gemcitabine has also been reported in the treatment
of nonresected pancreatic cancer with 9.7% grade 3
leukocytopenia,19 the frequency in this study was
relatively high. Onoue et al have reported as well
that severe leukocytopenia induced by gemcitabine
administration developed readily in patients who
had undergone surgical resection.30 This suggests
that it is very important to observe patients closely,
especially in adjuvant chemotherapy, to avoid fatal
toxicities. Nevertheless, as no serious adverse events
were observed in this study, we concluded that the
adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine with or
without UFT can be carried out safely.
Unfortunately, this study failed to show any additional benefit in using UFT in concert with gemcitabine for patients with resected pancreatic cancer.
Disease-free survival was similar in both groups,
with a 1-year disease-free survival rate of 49.0% in
the GEM group and a 50.0% rate in the GEM 1 UFT
group. Moreover, the overall survival rate was slightly
worse among the patients of the GEM 1 UFT group
than among those of the GEM group, with median
survival time of 21.2 months and 29.8 months,
respectively. Although the observation period was
short, we concluded from our data that other combinations with gemcitabine must be considered as

GEM 6 UFT for Resected Pancreatic Cancer/Yoshitomi et al

future trials for adjuvant chemotherapy for resected
pancreatic cancer.
Although UFT did not induce any survival
benefits, the patients of both groups who received
gemcitabine adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery
experienced relatively longer survival times. The median disease-free survival time of the total of 99
patients in this study was 12.0 months, and the median overall survival time was 24.1 months. The overall median survival time is usually reported as about
10 months to 20 months for patients with resected
pancreatic cancer who did not received adjuvant
chemotherapy.12-17,20 In addition, survival in this
study was favorable compared with studies of adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. The median overall survival time of patients with adjuvant therapy
was reported as 20.0 months in the GITSG study12
and 20.1 months in the ESPAC-1 study.17 Also, as
expected, our data were almost equivalent with the
CONKO-001 study, in which the median survival
time of patients with gemcitabine adjuvant chemotherapy was 22.1 months. These results support the
use of gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy in resectable pancreatic cancer.
The involvement of radiation as the adjuvant
therapy for patients with resected pancreatic cancer
has been discussed. The GITSG study showed the efficacy of chemoradiation as the adjuvant therapy.12
Conversely, the recent ESPAC-1 study failed to show
the efficacy of this therapy on postoperative survival,
in contrast to chemotherapy alone.17 In this study,
although the local recurrence was most frequently
observed, many of these patients also showed other
types of recurrences at the same time. This may indicate that the effect of radiation therapy as the adjuvant therapy might be limited regarding the survival
of patients with resected pancreatic cancer.
Interestingly, in this study there were no significant differences in disease-free and overall survival
rates between N2 and N1 patients and between R0
and R1 patients. Nodal status (N) and resection status (R) are usually considered prognostic factors for
pancreatic cancer after resection.31-33 However, the
ESPAC-1 study also reported that patients with R1
resection also benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy.31 These results may indicate that patients with
N1 or R1 status benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine.
In conclusion, the present study did not demonstrate the efficacy of a UFT and gemcitabine combination as an adjuvant therapy for patients with
resected pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine alone. It did, however, add further evidence that
an adjuvant therapy using gemcitabine can produce

2455

favorable effects on the prognosis without any severe
toxicity. This strongly suggests that further clinical
trial resources for adjuvant chemotherapy should be
addressed through the use of other combinations of
agents with gemcitabine.
