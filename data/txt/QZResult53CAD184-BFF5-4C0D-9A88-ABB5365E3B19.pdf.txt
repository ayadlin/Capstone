Abstract
Vascular proteins expressed at liver metastasis sites could serve as prognostic markers or as targets for
pharmacodelivery applications. We employed a proteomic approach to define such proteins in three syngeneic
mouse models of liver metastasis. Vascular structures were biotinylated in vivo by a terminal perfusion technique, followed by mass spectrometric analysis of accessible biotinylated proteins. In this manner, we identified 12 proteins for which expression was selectively associated with liver metastasis, confirming this
association by tissue immunofluorescence or in vivo localization with radiolabeled antibodies. In summary,
our findings identify vascular proteins that may have prognostic or drug-targeting use in addressing liver metastases, a common issue in many advanced cancers. Cancer Res; 70(1); 309–18. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
A promising approach to cancer therapy uses monoclonal
antibody derivatives for the selective delivery of bioactive
agents (e.g., full immunoglobulins for Fc-mediated cell killing, drugs with cleavable linkers, radionuclides, photosensitizers, procoagulant factors, and cytokines) to the tumor
environment, thus sparing normal tissues (1–8). Distant site
metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality (9), thus the identification of selective and accessible markers of tumor metastasis represents an essential requirement
for the development of antibody-based pharmacodelivery
strategies capable of targeting disseminated lesions (10).
Ligand-mediated pharmacodelivery options are particularly
attractive in consideration of the fact that many conventional
cytotoxic agents and therapeutic proteins typically exhibit
a reduced uptake at the tumor site compared with normal
organs (11, 12).
Our group has developed a chemical proteomics methodology for the identification of proteins which are readily accessible from the vasculature. The method relies on a
covalent biotinylation of vascular proteins by the in vivo
perfusion of laboratory animals (13, 14) or the ex vivo perfusion of surgically resected organs from patients (15, 16),
using reactive ester derivatives of biotin. Biotinylated proteins can be efficiently recovered from normal tissues and
pathologic specimens (e.g., tumors) by lysis in the presence

of strong detergents, followed by capture on streptavidinsepharose (14). On-resin tryptic digestion of biotinylated proteins, followed by nano-capillary high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) separation of eluted peptides and
their identification and relative quantification in the presence
of internal standards (17, 18), allows the characterization of
atlases of vascular proteins in normal organs and at sites of
disease, thus facilitating the discovery of accessible markers
of pathology.
In this study, we report the results of a perfusion-based
chemical proteomics study performed on three different syngeneic mouse models of liver metastasis. M5076 is a murine
reticulum cell sarcoma originated spontaneously in the ovary
of C57BL/6 mice and is highly invasive and metastatic. When
transplanted subcutaneously into mice, M5076 forms tumors
that spontaneously metastasize to the liver (19, 20). Colon38
and SL4 are murine colon carcinomas metastasizing to the
liver thereby mimicking the metastatic spread of colorectal
cancer in humans. SL4 has a higher metastatic potential
and was established by Morimoto-Tomita and colleagues by
repeated cycles of in vivo selections (21).
Among the 712 proteins identified with at least two peptides, 120 displayed a preferential expression in liver with
metastasis. For 12 of 12 of these markers, which were overexpressed in at least two different models of metastasis and
for which antibodies were available, a preferential expression
in metastatic lesions was confirmed by immunofluorescence
analysis. Furthermore, radiolabeled preparations of monoclonal antibodies specific to periostin, to the extra-domain A
(EDA) of fibronectin and to angiopoietin-related protein 2,
were shown to selectively target liver metastasis in vivo,
following i.v. administration.

that are in compliance with national and international laws
and policies. Female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from
Harlan and used at 5 to 6 wk of age.
Cell lines and cell culture. Mouse colon carcinoma cell
lines, Colon38 and SL4, were kindly provided by Dr. Tsatsuro
Irimura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium
(Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS.
Mouse reticulum cell sarcoma M5076 (22) were maintained
in RPMI 1640 containing 15% heat-inactivated horse serum
(Invitrogen Life Technologies).
Tumor models. Liver metastasis were obtained by intrasplenic injection of 1 × 106 cells in 50 μL of suspension (Colon38
and SL4; ref. 21) and by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 106 cells
in 200 μL of suspension (M5076; ref. 23). Tumor-bearing mice
were used for in vivo biotinylation, targeting experiments, and
organ excision for immunohistochemical analysis.
In vivo biotinylation. In vivo biotinylation experiments
were performed as previously described (13, 14). After perfusion, organs and tumors were excised and specimens were
either freshly snap-frozen for preparation of organ homogenates or embedded in cryoembedding compound (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and frozen in liquid nitrogen–cooled isopentane for the preparation of cryosections for histochemical
analysis. A total of 38 tumor-bearing mice (Colon38, SL4, and
M5076) and 11 healthy mice were perfused. Unperfused mice
(healthy and tumor-bearing) were used as negative controls
for the proteomic analysis.
Histochemistry. To confirm successful in vivo biotinylation, staining of biotinylated structures was performed as described (13) using streptavidin/biotinylated alkaline
phosphatase complex (Biospa), Fast-Red TR (Sigma; in the
presence of 1 mmol/L levamisole to inhibit endogenous alkaline phosphatase), and hematoxylin solution (Sigma) for
counterstaining.
Preparation of protein extracts for proteomic analysis.
Livers (with or without metastases) were resuspended in
lysis buffer [2% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris, 10 mmol/L EDTA, and
CompletE Proteinase Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)
in PBS (pH 7.4)], using 40 μL/mg of tissue. The specimens were
then homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax T8 disperser (IKAWerke) and sonicated using a Vibra-cell (Sonics), followed
by 15 min of incubation at 80°C and 20 min of centrifugation
at 15,000 × g. The resulting supernatants (“total protein extracts”) were used for the subsequent capture step on streptavidin-resin, determining protein concentration with the BCA
Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Purification of biotinylated proteins. For each sample,
400 μL streptavidin-sepharose (GE Healthcare) slurry were
washed thrice in buffer A (1% NP40, 0.1% SDS in PBS), pelleted, and mixed with 5 mg of total protein extract. The capture of biotinylated proteins was allowed to proceed for 2 h
at room temperature in a revolving mixer. The supernatant
was removed, and the resin was washed thrice with buffer A,
twice with buffer B (0.1% SDS, 2 mol/L NaCl in PBS, at 40°C),
and eight times with digestion buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
1 mmol/L CaCl2; pH 8.0). Finally, the resin was resuspended
in 200 μL of digestion buffer and 20 μL of sequencing grade–

modified porcine trypsin (stock solution of 80 ng/μL in digestion buffer; Promega) were added. Protease digestion was
carried out overnight at 37°C under constant agitation. Peptides were desalted, purified, and concentrated with C18 microcolumns (OMIX tips; Varian, Inc.). After lyophilization,
peptides were stored at −20°C.
Nanocapillary reverse-phase HPLC with online fraction
spotting onto matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
plates. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase
HPLC using an UltiMate nanoscale LC system and a FAMOS
microautosampler (LC Packings) controlled by the Chromeleon software (Dionex). Mobile phase A consisted of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, mobile phase
B of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water.
The flow rate was 300 nL/min. Lyophilized peptides derived
from the digestion of biotinylated protein affinity purified
from 2 mg of total protein were dissolved in 5 μL of buffer
A and loaded on the column (inner diameter, 75 μm; length,
15 cm; filled with C18 PepMap 100, 3 μm, 100 Å beads; LC
Packings). The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0%
B for 3 min, 0% to 52% B for 200 min, 52% to 100% B for
10 min, 100% B for 5 min, and the column was equilibrated
with 100% A for 20 min before analyzing the next sample.
Eluting fractions were mixed with a solution of 3 mg/mL
a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 277 pmol/mL of each of
the four internal standard peptides ([des-arg9]-bradykinin,
neurotensin, angiotensin I, and adrenocorticotropic hormone
fragments 1–17; all from Sigma), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid,
and 70% acetonitrile in water and deposed on a blank matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target plate
(832 spots per sample) using an online Probot system (Dionex).
The final concentration of each internal standard peptide
was 50 fmol per spot.
MALDI-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry.
MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF analysis was carried out
with the 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All spectra were acquired with a solid-state laser
(355 nm) at a laser repetition rate of 200 Hz. After measuring
all samples in the mass spectrometry (MS) mode, a maximum of 15 precursors per spot were automatically selected
for subsequent CID fragmentation. Resulting spectra were
processed and analyzed using both the ProteinPilot software
(Paragon Algorithm, Applied Biosystems) and the Global Protein Server Workstation [Applied Biosystems, using internal
MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK)], for matching MS
and MS/MS data against databases of in silico–digested
proteins. The data obtained were screened against a database of all mouse proteins downloaded from the European
Bioinformatics Institute homepage.3 Furthermore, the following analysis settings were used for the identification
of peptides and proteins: (a) precursor tolerance, 15 ppm;
(b) MS/MS fragment tolerance, 0.2 Da; (c) maximal missed
cleavages, 2; and (d) one variable modification (oxidation of

methionine). Peptides were considered correct calls when
the confidence interval was >95%.
Relative protein quantification by DeepQuanTR software. The DeepQuanTR software has been described in detail elsewhere.4 Briefly, after MS acquisition, data related to
the individual peaks (fractions, intensities, m/z ratios) were
loaded into the DeepQuanTR software, which performed a
normalization of individual signal intensities to the internal
standard peptides and an annotation (peptide identification and association with a parent protein). Normalized intensities for the individual peptides from all samples of
each liver group (i.e., healthy, M5076, SL4, and Colon38
mice) were used for the computation of DeepQuanTR peptide and protein scores, indicating the relative abundance
of individual peptides and proteins in the various groups of
samples.
Immunofluorescence analysis. All immunofluorescence
analyses were performed according to standard protocol on
acetone-fixed cryostat sections (10 μm) of freshly frozen liver
metastases (Colon38, SL4, and M5076). Staining with antiembigin, anti–fibulin-2, anti–latent-transforming growth factor β-binding protein 4 (LTBP-4), and anti-orosomucoid 1
antibodies were done using goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor594 as secondary antibody. Donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor594 was used as a secondary antibody for the detection of
apolipoprotein H, inter–α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4,
and versican. Staining with anti–angiopoietin-related protein
2 and anti-periostin was obtained with donkey anti-rat Alexa
Fluor-488. Immunofluorescent staining with scFv antibodies
anti-oncofetal fibronectin and anti–large isoform of tenascin c,
carrying myc-tag, was performed using a rat anti-myc antibody and detected with donkey anti-rat Alexa Fluor-488. Nuclei
were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Invitrogen). Slides were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation) and examined by an Axioskop2 microscope (Zeiss).
Biodistribution studies. In vivo targeting performance of
four monoclonal antibodies against oncofetal fibronectin,
periostin, angiopoietin-related protein 2, and an antibody
of irrelevant specificity was evaluated by quantitative biodistribution analysis as previously described (24). Mice bearing
Colon38 liver metastases were sacrificed 48 h after the injection of 125I-labeled antibodies. Organs were weighed and radioactivity was counted with a Cobra γ-counter (Packard).
Radioluminography (phosphor image analysis). To investigate the distribution of radiolabeled antibodies within
the tumor mass, both whole metastases–bearing lobes and
20-μm sections were analyzed with a phosphor storage plate.
Whole lobes were resected, photographed, and exposed overnight at 4°C to the plate. Sections were acetone-fixed, stained
with hematoxylin, scanned using a desktop scanner to correlate the morphology with the antibody distribution, and
exposed to the phosphor plate for 14 d. Phosphor storage
plates were scanned using a BAS-5000 phosphor image reader
(Fujifilm).

Microautoradiography. Forty-eight hours after the i.v.
injection of radiolabeled antibodies, mice were sacrificed
and metastatic livers were embedded and frozen in optimal
cutting temperature compound medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ten-micrometer sections were cut, fixed with icecold acetone, and coated with NBT Kodak autoradiography
emulsion (Kodak). After drying, the slides were stored at 4°C
in the dark for ∼4 wk. The autoradiography emulsions
were developed (Kodak Developer D-19) for 4 min and
fixed (Kodak Eastman Fixer) for 5 min. Finally, slides were
rinsed with deionized water and counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma).
Immunofluorescence analysis of in vivo–injected antibodies. To investigate the in vivo distribution and penetration
of the antibodies within the metastases, immunofluorescence
staining was performed 48 h after i.v. injection. Fixed sections
(10 μm) were incubated with hamster anti-mouse CD31 antibody and staining was obtained using donkey anti-rat Alexa
Fluor-488 and goat anti-hamster Cy5 secondary antibodies.
Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation) and analyzed with a confocal laser
scanning microscope (LSM 510 META; Zeiss). Images were
further processed using ImageJ software.5 To conform with
previous stainings, Alexa Fluor-488 is shown in red and Cy5
in green.

Results
Liver metastases of Colon38, SL4, and M5076 tumors were
developed in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice by subcutaneous (M5076) or intrasplenic (Colon38 and SL4) injection of
tumor cells. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the
perfusion procedure used for in vivo biotinylation. Following
terminal anesthesia, the thorax was opened and the large circulation perfused by intracardiac administration of ∼17 mL
of an aqueous solution of Sulpho-NHS-LC-Biotin (1 mg/mL)
over 5 min, followed by perfusion with a quenching solution to block unreacted biotin ester. In this procedure,
proteins are biotinylated not only on endothelial cells
but also in the perivascular extracellular matrix and on
the membrane of perivascular cells (10, 13). A total of 49
mice were perfused, including 11 healthy mice, whose normal livers served as negative controls for the identification
of markers of metastasis. Furthermore, nonperfused mice
(healthy and tumor-bearing) were used to evaluate nonspecific binding of proteins to the streptavidin resin. Liver
metastases of M5076 were typically smaller and more numerous compared with Colon38 and its highly metastatic
variant SL4. In all cases, however, an efficient biotinylation
not only of liver vessels and sinusoids but also of vascular
structures in metastatic lesions could be confirmed by streptavidin-based staining of liver sections (Fig. 1B). Following

discovery. Healthy mice (n = 11) or mice bearing Colon38 (n = 11), SL4 (n = 14), or M5076 (n = 13) metastases were subjected to the terminal perfusion with a
reactive ester derivative of biotin. This procedure resulted in the covalent modification of proteins accessible from the bloodstream (e.g., luminal and
abluminal membrane proteins of endothelial cells, proteins of the extracellular matrix, and proteins on the membrane of cells in close proximity to blood
vessels) with biotin. Subsequently, tissue specimens from the normal liver of healthy mice as well as from the metastases were used for the preparation of
total protein extracts. Biotin-tagged proteins were then enriched on streptavidin sepharose and digested on-resin with trypsin. The resulting peptides
were separated by nano-capillary reverse-phase HPLC and eluting fractions were mixed with constant amounts of internal standard peptides. Following
MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis of each fraction, the DeepQuanTR software was used for the relative quantification of protein abundances.

processed separately, homogenized in the presence of 2%

were tryptically digested on-resin. The resulting peptides were
separated by reverse-phase nano-HPLC, mixed with pure peptides serving as internal standards for relative quantification
(17, 25), and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF
(Fig. 1A).

whereas downregulated proteins were displayed in red. The
color intensity relates to the magnitude of the differences in
MS signals for the various peptides (see also Fig. 3). Relevant
proteins include embigin, splice variants of fibronectin and of
tenascin-C, fibulin-2, LTBP-4, periostin, versican, vitronectin,
CD44, CD93, CD98, and thrombospondin-1. The complete list
of regulated proteins can be found in Supportive Table S1.
We focused our attention on a subset of proteins for which
antibodies were available either commercially or in our laboratory. Figure 3 shows the relative average signal intensities
for multiple individual tryptic peptides belonging to 12 individual proteins, which have been studied in more detail.
Most proteins exhibited an upregulation in all three models
of liver metastasis. However, integrin α-M exhibited a striking overexpression only in the M5076 model, in line with the
macrophage origin of this tumor (19). By contrast, orosomucoid 1 and splice isoforms of tenascin-C were found to be
upregulated mainly in the liver metastases of colorectal cancer origin. The alternatively spliced fibronectin domains EDA

and IIICS exhibited a dramatic upregulation in metastatic
liver. By contrast, unspliced fibronectin portions could be detected both in normal liver and in metastatic lesions (Supportive Fig. S1). The immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3)
nicely confirmed the protein expression data derived from
the MS analysis and presented either as global DeepQuanTR
values for the individual gene products (Fig. 2) or as patterns of
average signal intensities for the individual tryptic peptides
(Fig. 3). Some of the strongest vascular staining patterns were
observed for angiopoietin-related protein 2, fibulin-2, LTBP-4,
inter–α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4, periostin, as well as for
splice isoforms of fibronectin and of tenascin-C (Fig. 3). Versican displayed a clear, yet weaker neovascular staining and has
recently been associated with the metastatic phenotype by
macrophage activation (26).
To confirm that proteins overexpressed at metastatic sites
could be targeted in vivo using specific monoclonal antibodies, we performed biodistribution studies, autoradiographic analyses, and microscopic staining using radioiodinated

antibody preparations following i.v. administration. Among
the antigens exhibiting the most intense staining patterns
in immunofluorescence (Fig. 3), we chose splice variants of
fibronectin (27), periostin, and angiopoietin-related protein
2 as targets, for which good-quality monoclonal antibodies
were available (27). Figure 4A depicts biodistribution results
in liver metastases, primary spleen tumors, and normal organs for the Colon38 model, 48 hours after i.v. administration
of 125I-labeled antibodies. As a negative control, an IgG of irrelevant specificity was used. A preferential accumulation in
the cancer lesions was observed for the three specific monoclonal antibodies. The best lesion/organ and lesion/blood ratios were observed for the antibodies specific to the EDA
domain of oncofetal fibronectin and periostin (Fig. 4A). The
anti-EDA monoclonal antibody also efficiently targeted the
primary tumors in the spleen (tumor/blood = 32). By contrast, a negative control IgG exhibited tumor/blood ratios
of <0.4 at the same time point. A phosphor image autoradiographic analysis (Fig. 4B), as well as microautoradiographic
and immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 4C), confirmed the
preferential accumulation of the three antibodies on the metastatic lesions, with a vascular pattern of staining for periostin and angiopoietin-like 2 and a rather stromal targeting
pattern for the EDA domain of fibronectin (see also Supportive Fig. S2).

Discussion
In this article, we have presented a proteomics analysis of
three syngeneic mouse models of liver metastasis. The proteins identified in this study had been biotinylated in vivo using a rapid terminal perfusion procedure with a reactive ester
derivative of biotin. The subsequent MS analysis of the
corresponding tryptic peptides led to the characterization
of specific antigens, which are upregulated in liver metastasis
and are readily accessible from the vasculature. A total of 712
proteins were identified, of which 120 showed a protein
quant value of >2.03 (10-fold upregulation) in at least one
of the three analyzed models, which represented suitable
candidates for a detailed expression analysis. Twelve antibodies were used for the immunofluorescence staining of liver
metastasis samples from the three tumor models, revealing
an excellent agreement between MS-derived protein expression data and immunodetection. Three targets (EDA domain
of oncofetal fibronectin, periostin, and angiopoietin-related
protein 2) were studied in more detail with i.v.-administered
radiolabeled antibody preparations, confirming that these
structures could efficiently be targeted in vivo, using suitable
affinity reagents.
Some of the proteins identified as accessible markers of
metastasis in this study had previously been found by our
group and by other investigators to be overexpressed in solid
tumors. For example, we had previously reported on the upregulation of periostin, thrombospondins, MG-50 and versican in the ex vivo perfusion of surgically-resected human
kidney with cancer (15), and of collagen αXII and vitronectin
in the ex vivo biotinylation of resected human colorectal cancer (16). The overexpression of proteins such as periostin

316

(28, 29) and versican (26) has recently been associated with
an invasive and metastatic phenotype in solid tumors. Furthermore, in vivo biotinylation analysis of mice bearing F9
metastases and renal carcinoma had revealed the EDA domain of fibronectin, CD98, and embigin as suitable markers
of metastasis (Fig. 2; refs. 10, 13).
Monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives are increasingly being used in anticancer therapeutic strategies for the
selective delivery of bioactive agents (e.g., full immunoglobulins for Fc-mediated cell killing, drugs with cleavable linkers,
radionuclides, photosensitizers, procoagulant factors, and cytokines) to the tumor environment, thus sparing normal tissues (1–7). Although monoclonal antibodies specific to
membrane antigens on cancer cells were originally used for
tumor-targeting applications, alternative targets such as
markers of angiogenesis (1, 8, 30), stromal antigens (2, 31,
32), and intracellular proteins released at sites of necrosis
(33) are increasingly being considered. In all these cases,
antibody-mediated pharmacodelivery options seem to be
particularly attractive considering the fact that most conventional cytotoxic agents and many therapeutic proteins exhibit a reduced uptake at the tumor site compared with normal
organs (11, 12). The in vivo targeting results presented in this
study with anti-EDA, anti-periostin, and anti–angiopoietinrelated protein 2 antibodies were extremely promising, with
tumor/blood ratios of >30 for primary spleen tumors and >15
for liver metastases, using the F8 anti-EDA antibody 48 h after
i.v. administration (Fig. 4). Importantly, as the targeted structures represent only a small portion of the total tumor mass
(34), the local concentration of antibody delivered to vascular
tumor structures is particularly high and should facilitate
pharmacodelivery applications.
The proteins identified in our analysis included antigens
expressed by endothelial cells, by tumor cells, and in the extracellular matrix. Restricting the analysis to luminal antigens only would require the availability of biotinylation
reagents that would not cross the endothelial layer. However,
our group has had good experiences in tumor-targeting applications using monoclonal antibodies specific to stromal
antigens and to components of the modified subendothelial
extracellular matrix (1, 2). In particular, derivatives of monoclonal antibodies specific to the EDA (10, 27) and EDB domain of fibronectin (24, 35), and to the A1 domain of
tenascin-C (36, 37), have exhibited excellent tumor-targeting
properties in animal tumor models (37–40) and in patients
with cancer (41, 42), and are currently being investigated in
phase I and phase II clinical trials in oncology and in arthritis. The results described in this article indicate that a
number of other antigens could be considered for in vivo
pharmacodelivery applications. Among them, periostin could
be efficiently and selectively targeted by a cognate monoclonal antibody and thus deserves a closer investigation as an
antigen for the development of ligand-based anticancer imaging and innovative therapeutic strategies.
