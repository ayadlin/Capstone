ABSTRACT
Objective: Most comprehensive treatments for PBC include UDCA, combination
of methotrexate (MTX), corticosteroids (COT), colchicine (COC) or bezafibrate (BEF),
cyclosporin A (CYP), D-penicillamine (DPM), methotrexate (MTX), or azathioprine
(AZP). Since the optimum treatment regimen remains inconclusive, we aimed to
compare these therapies in terms of patient mortality or liver transplantation (MOLT)
and adverse event (AE).
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane Library for
randomized controlled trials until August 2014. We estimated HRs for MOLT and ORs
for AE. The sensitivity analysis based on dose of UDCA was also performed.
Results: The search identified 49 studies involving 12 different treatment
regimens and 4182 patients. Although no statistical significance can be found in
MOLT, COT plus UDCA was ranked highest for efficacy outcome amongst all the
treatment regimes. While for AEs, compared with OBS or UDCA, monotherapy with
COC (OR 5.6, P < 0.001; OR 5.89, P < 0.001), CYP (OR 3.24, P < 0.001; OR 3.42,
P < 0.001), DPM (OR 8.00, P < 0.001; OR 8.45, P < 0.001) and MTX (OR 5.31, P <
0.001; OR 5.61, P < 0.001) were associated with statistically significant increased
risk of AEs. No significant differences were found for other combination regimes.
Effect estimates from indirect comparisons matched closely to estimates derived
from pairwise comparisons. Consistently, in the sensitivity analysis, results closely
resembled our primary analysis.
Conclusions: COT plus UDCA was the most efficacious among treatment regimens
both for MOLT and AEs.

INTRODUCTION

Consistently, the clinical outcomes of other additional
therapies (COT or BEF) to UDCA still remain unclear or
yield inconsistent results [2, 15].
Therefore, in order to attempt to resolve this issue,
which theoretically may be answered by conducting a
very large clinical trial with multiple comparator arms,
of conflicting results in PBC treatments for patients,
we performed the network meta-analysis, which allows
us to integrate direct and indirect comparisons to
simultaneously compare several treatments [16-18]. The
objective of network meta-analysis was to apply the
established methodology used in network meta-analysis to
an area of clinical practice where no such previous studies
have existed. In such cases, our aims were to summarize a
much broader evidence base and to indirectly compare the
relative efficacy and safety of these treatments with most
comprehensive therapies (AZP, MTX, COT, COC, CYP,
DPM, UDCA, MTX plus UDCA, COT plus UDCA, COC
plus UDCA or BEF plus UDCA) for patients with PBC.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic
progressive inflammatory autoimmune- mediated liver
disease that primarily affects middle-aged women with a
gender ratio of 1:10 [1]. The annual incidence of primary
biliary cirrhosis ranges from 1 to 49 persons per million,
and the prevalence was estimated between 7 to 402
persons per million [2].
So far, some single or combined therapies have
been studied by randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
However, which treatment regime is optimal for patients
with PBC remains controversial. Although UDCA is
the only medical treatment that has received U.S. Food
and Drug Administration approval [3], the effects of
UDCA evaluated by several clinical studies have yielded
conflicting results. Some randomized clinical trials
(RCT) have confirmed that UDCA is an effective medical
treatment for the disease [4-7]. Also, UDCA has been
shown to improve not only symptoms, liver enzymes, and
liver histology, but also patient survival [8-9]. Conversely,
two comprehensive traditional meta-analyses which
include 16 recent RCTs concluded that the use of UDCA
did not demonstrate any benefit on mortality and mortality
or live transplantation (MOLT) [10-11]. Furthermore, PBC
disease continued to progress in many patients who do not
show complete response during UDCA therapy, hence,
additional medical treatment or other drugs are urgently
required.
Other drugs for the treatment of PBC have been
studied for the past decade as single agents or adjuvant
medications, which are mainly immunomodulatory and
other agents, such as colchicine (COC), cyclosporin A
(CYP), D-penicillamine (DPM), methotrexate (MTX),
corticosteroids (COT), bezafibrate (BEF), or azathioprine
(AZP). Although some of these drugs when administered
as monotherapy showed little benefit for patients with
PBC in clinical outcomes from several conventional
meta-analyses, we are still unable to identify the clinical
effects of drugs evaluated in traditional meta-analysis with
a small number of included studies. Moreover, addition
of these treatments to UDCA was evaluated by some
studies. Combination therapy with UDCA and COC in
patients with PBC has been evaluated in a small study
and in a large double blind, placebo-controlled study
[12-13]. Results from the Japanese study (12) indicate
no benefits from the addition of COC to UDCA, whilst
the French RCT (13) suggests that the addition of COC to
UDCA provides only a marginal advantage over UDCA
monotherapy. The role of combination therapy with MTX
and UDCA were evaluated by Leung et al, which showed a
clinical improvement compared with that predicted by the
Mayo model [3, 14]. However, another RCT evaluating
a combination of MTX plus UDCA demonstrated that
there was no improvement in symptoms and the regime
may have been associated with substantial toxicity.

RESULTS
Study characteristics
3133 studies were identified for review of title and
abstract (Supplementary 1). After the initial screening,
we retrieved the full text of potentially eligible articles
for detailed assessment, 3084 articles were excluded. We
included forty-nine eligible studies for meta-analysis, with
a total of 4182 patients who received one of the eleven
treatment strategies including monotherapy with UDCA,
AZP, MTX, COT, COC, CYP, DPM, combination of MTX
plus UDCA, COT plus UDCA, COC plus UDCA, BEF
plus UDCA or observation (Figure 1). The duration of
treatment ranged from three months to ten years, and the
mean age of trial participants was 55.3 years and ranged
from 24 to 79 years. Most trials (47 [96%] of 31) were
two-grouped studies and only two [19-20] were threegrouped studies and mean study sample was 41.8 patients
per group (minimum-maximum 4-176). For the primary
outcome, twelve unique comparisons were available
for 40 [2, 4-5, 7, 15, 20-37] different trials. In terms of
outcome of safety, there were also 40 [2-5, 7, 12-13, 2032, 34-35, 38-55] trials providing data for twelve unique
comparisons. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics
of the included forty-nine studies. Supplementary 2
shows the quality assessment parameter assessed by the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which was rated as good, even
though some studies did not reported details regarding
randomization and allocation concealment.

Results from pair-wise comparisons

(86.9%), with two studies in the meta-analysis, and DPM
versus OBS, with five studies included. While in terms of
AEs, I² values higher than 50% were recorded for only one
comparison: CYP versus OBS (52.6%), with three studies
in the meta-analysis, and the remaining comparisons
were all lower than 40%. In addition, all P values for
Begg’s rank correlation test and Egger’s test were greater
than 0.05, indicating that no publication bias was found
amongst those pairwise comparisons of different treatment
regimens. (Table 3)

Seven different comparisons were accomplished
in pairwise meta-analysis. The weighted HRs for MOLT
and ORs for AEs, respectively, were calculated for each
comparison. The geometric distribution of controlled
trials on MOLT (Figure 1A) and AEs (Figure 1B) were
displayed. The weighted hazard ratios and odds ratios for
the two outcomes, MOLT and AEs, were calculated for
each comparison. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed
using the I2 statistic, which was assessable in two of the
comparisons.
Overall, statistical heterogeneity was moderate,
although for some comparisons 95% CIs were wide and
included values indicating very high or no heterogeneity
(Table 2). In the meta-analyses of direct comparisons for
efficacy, I² values higher than 75% were recorded for
only two comparisons: COC plus UDCA versus UDCA

although differing not significantly, there was a trend that
combination of COT plus UDCA was most effective in
reducing the risk of MOLT than AZP (HR 3.78, 95%CI
0.63 to 23.74), COC (HR 3.52, 95%CI 0.71 to 18.96),
COT (HR 4.77, 95%CI 0.37 to 66.21), CYP (HR 3.81,
95%CI 0.66 to 26.50), DPM (HR 1.31, 95%CI 0.27 to

2.01, 95%CI 0.50 to 8.84), monotherapy with UDCA (HR
2.63, 95%CI 0.72 to 10.75), COC plus UDCA (HR 2.55,
95%CI 0.44 to 15.03), MTX plus UDCA (HR 3.58, 95%CI

0.61 to 21.96) or BEF plus UDCA (HR 3.48, 95%CI 0.21
to 56.93). Consistently, Figure 2B shows that for AEs,
when compared with OBS, COC (HR 0.18, 95%CI 0.06
to 0.51), CYP (HR 0.31, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.83), DPM (HR
0.13, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.29) and MTX (HR 0.19, 95%CI
0.04 to 0.83) yielded a significant difference in causing
AEs. In addition, compared with UDCA, a statistical
significance was also achieved in COC (HR 0.17, 95%CI
0.05 to 0.55), CYP (HR 0.29, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.87), DPM
(HR 0.12, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.31) and MTX (HR 0.18,

Figure 3 shows the distribution of probabilities for
each treatment being ranked at different positions for the
outcome of MOLT or AEs. Although the efficacy effects
of combined therapy of COT plus UDCA compared
with OBS compared with placebo was not statistically
significant, COT plus UDCA had the greatest probability
(48%) for being the best treatment option on reducing
risk of MOLT. While in terms of AEs, DPM had the
highest probabilities (28%) of reduction in AEs (Figure
3), suggesting DPM was more likely to cause AEs than
remaining treatments. On the other hand, COC or COT
plus UDCA demonstrated the least adverse events, the
cumulative probabilities of being ranked first and second
in with respect to the safety profile was combination of
COC or COT and UDCA. Figure 4 presents comparisonadjusted funnel plot for UDCA-based therapies network,

overlapped. The P-values show no significant difference
between the direct and indirect effects (Table 4). In
general, the node splitting method showed no significant
inconsistency within the networks for any of the two
outcomes.

Sensitivity analysis
In the sensitivity analysis, there were eleven trials
[2, 12, 22, 24-25, 27-28, 31, 33, 35, 39] excluded which
reported patients administrated by high (more than 500
mg/kg/day) dose of UDCA (BEF plus UDCA excluded).
Thirty-eight independent studies were performed for
the primary outcome, MOLT. Overall, the sensitivity
analysis showed that omitting those trials with high dose
UDCA did not impact on the ranking order and statistical
significance of the remaining treatments. Supplementary
3A indicates that combination of COT and UDCA was the
top-ranked treatments, although differ not significantly.
Similar findings were also observed for the outcome of
AEs. DPM, COC or CYP were associated with significant
effects in causing AEs compared with OBS. Besides, COT
or COC plus UDCA were ranked the least possibility to
cause AEs (Supplementary 3B).

Comparisons between traditional pairwise and
network meta-analyses

network meta-analyses. Although the pooled estimates
showed small differences, the confidence intervals from

experimental treatments. COC: colchicine; BEF: bezafibrate; COT: corticosteroids; MTX: methotrexate; UDCA: ursodeoxycholic acid;

DISCUSSION

provide a formal rank order for all treatment strategies
by their capacity to reduce the risk of MOLT or AEs by
conducting a network meta-analysis, and this is only
attainable by using a Bayesian approach. Finally, in
order to reduce concerns on potential inconsistency, we
performed inconsistency diagnostic for all triangular and
quadrilateral loops. In addition, statistical heterogeneity
was moderate, although for some I² values of comparisons,
heterogeneity was high (Table 2). In order to test the
robustness of our results due to high heterogeneity values
in some comparisons, we performed sensitivity analysis
regarding to patients administrated by high (more than 500
mg/kg/day) dose of UDCA (BEF plus UDCA excluded),
which showed that the results was similar to our main
analysis. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of AEs to
obtain a favorable benefit-risk ratio for patients with PBC
based on all treatments.
We do also have to acknowledge several limitations
in the analysis. Firstly, it may be argued that the inclusion
of trial patients with optimum dose of UDCA and trials
with high dose may have biased results. However, a
sensitivity analysis excluding trials in trials where patients
were administrated by high dose of UDCA yielded much

In this network meta-analysis reviewing the efficacy
and safety of most comprehensive interventions in patients
with PBC to date, we found that combined therapy with
COT and UDCA was the most effective in reducing
the risk of MOLT with a weighted benefit-risk ratio for
patients with PBC. Monotherapy with DPM, CYP, AZP
or MTX received statistical significance in causing AEs
where treatment with DPM showed higher probabilities
of being at the superior ranking positions in AEs. These
estimates are fairly robust and changed little in sensitivity
analyses.
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, our
network meta-analysis, until more evidences of direct
active comparisons are reported, provides a useful and
complete picture for propensity of most comprehensive
treatments associated with efficacy and safety outcomes
among patients with PBC. Network meta-analysis allowed
comparison of all available strategies in a single analysis
to give a combined total 4182 patients of treatments,
rather than separate and disconnected meta-analyses for
individual pairs of treatments. Secondly, we were able to

the same results as the primary analysis. Secondly, the
study size assigned to different comparisons was overall
small in most included studies in this analysis. However,
our study had established the largest PBC treatment
sample size for trials performed to date in the world.
Thirdly, Factors such as trial heterogeneity, bias and
inconsistency can affect the estimates reported in the study
[56]. For instance, this analysis was performed on the
assumption of consistency where the validity of indirect
comparisons was determined by the extent of clinical and
methodological trial similarity. However, inconsistency
remains a methodological issue of multiple treatment
comparisons, as it arises from pooling the data and small
number of trials available for the different comparisons
resulting in discrepancies between the direct and indirect
comparisons, and consequently threatening the validity of
the results [56-58]. Furthermore, we are unable to provide
comparisons of drug efficacy based on disease duration,
MELD, and the presence of cirrhosis due to lack of the
above information reported from included trials. Hence,
further studies need to be conducted on disease duration,
MELD, and the presence of cirrhosis. In the case of our
network meta-analysis, the indirect estimates were often
very similar to those obtained in the direct comparisons
because only single comparisons were available for the
majority of the cases. This resulted in a less conventional
geometry where our network of trials did not have any
closed loops. Finally, our analysis was that not all AE
outcomes of interest were reported consistently across
trials. Furthermore, there were cases where no events
had occurred for the outcome of interest resulting in
the requirement to add a continuity correction to the
results [58]. In general, missing data resulted in wider
credible intervals due to greater uncertainty around the
estimates. However, despite these limitations, this network
meta-analysis provides the largest scale comparative
information on the major clinical outcome profiles of
different interventions in current use.
Our study results are consistent with some of
previous pairwise meta-analyses, but the network metaanalysis incorporates both direct and indirect comparisons
of treatment strategies, including those that have never
been compared directly. UDCA appears a safe regimen
and may be useful for preventing the progression of PBC,
which is the only therapy approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration [59]. However, one traditional
meta-analysis in 2008 [10] and another published in 2012
[11] of 16 RCTs both reported that, although differing
not significantly, they did not demonstrate any benefit
of UDCA on mortality and MOLT of patients with PBC.
These findings are consistent with our results. In addition,
some trials have also concluded that UDCA has no
beneficial effect on patient survival, but may be a safe
option for patients with PBC. As previously reported in
a Canadian Multicenter RCT (reference here), UDCA,
when administered to patients with PBC, led to an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

improvement in clinical outcomes. However, a larger data
sample is needed to determine whether UDCA therapy has
a beneficial effect on PBC patient survival. Hence, one
possible explanation for seemingly inconsistent results,
was that the small patient population in those trials which
supported UDCA was beneficial to patients.
Although our analysis did not demonstrate that
combination therapy of COT with UDCA had a significant
risk reduction in MOLT, we found the evidence favoring
COT plus UDCA compared with OBS (HR 2.01, 95%CI
0.5 to 8.84), and further network meta-analysis results also
revealed similar non-significant relationship. The results
of our analysis on efficacy are remarkably similar with
several studies. A previous meta-analysis in 2013 [60]
was performed of RCTs concluded that the combination
therapy of UDCA and COT was more effective in
comparison to monotherapy with UDCA for patients with
PBC, which we also found in both our direct and indirect
comparisons. Similarly, two RCTs [61-62] of the analysis
showed that COT plus UDCA appeared to be the best
therapeutic option for PBC patients. In addition, COT plus
UDCA had the probability of being ranked second with
respect to safety outcome. Few AEs were reported, which
included osteoporosis, bleeding, aggravated itching, and
diarrhea in only two included RCTs [26, 29] associated
with COT plus UDCA.
Besides, other single therapies, such as DPM, CYP,
AZP or MTX, were also evaluated by several studies.
The results of our analysis showed compared with OBS,
CYP, DPM or MTX were significantly more likely to
cause AEs. Further, no survival benefits can also be
found in treatments with CYP, AZP, MTX or MTX. As
reported by AASLD in 2009 [59], the clinical guidelines
do not recommend any of above treatments. Some headto-head meta-analyses [63-65] all found that treatments
with AZP, CYP or MTX did not appear to reduce the risk
of MOLT, and led to more AEs for patients with PBC,
which are consistent with our results. As is showed in our
analysis, treatment with DPM had the highest probabilities
of being ranked top in adverse-effects, which included
rash, thrombocytopenia, myasthenia, arthralgia, etc [4243,48,52]. In addition, two following traditional metaanalyses [66-67] showed that treatment with DPM was
associated with little clinical benefits over OBS, and
increased the risk of causing the AEs. Therefore, based on
our analysis incorporating direct and indirect evidences,
there was little evidence favoring the use of these single
drugs in clinical efficacy or safety profile.
In conclusion, the study suggests that the superiority
of using COT plus UDCA in the treatment of PBC with
weighted benefit-risk ratio in MOLT and AEs. For
outcome of AEs, UDCA-based therapies, such as UDCA,
COT plus UDCA or COC plus UDCA, all showed welltolerated in adverse effects. While single treatments
with CYP, DPM or MTX all have achieved statistically
significant as compared with OBS, increased risk of AEs

compared and number of patients assigned to each group,
the number of events of interest in each group. When
relevant information on design or outcomes was unclear,
or when doubt existed about duplicate publications, we
contacted the original authors for clarification. We choose
two clinically meaningful events to estimate efficacy
and safety separately of treatments for network metaanalysis: MOLT, which was commonly considered as the
most important evaluation, and AEs, including serious
events (defined as any untoward medical occurrence that
was life threatening, resulted in death, or was persistent
or led to significant disability) or non-serious events
(that is, any medical occurrence not necessarily having
a causal relationship with the treatment). When relevant
information on design or outcomes was unclear, or when
some needed data was unavailable directly from the study,
the original authors were contacted for clarifications and
assistance by email.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Search strategy
We adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)
statement for reporting systematic reviews and metaanalyses in healthcare interventions (Supplementary
4) [68]. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus,
Embase, and the Cochrane Library) were searched until
the end of August 2014 for randomized controlled trials
investigating any treatments for patients with PBC, with
the key terms “treatments/therapies, primary biliary
cirrhosis, randomized clinical trial” without any language
or date restrictions. We also searched the additional
studies in the reference lists of all identified publications,
including relevant meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
Two reviewers (Zhu GQ, Huang S) independently
assessed the eligibility of all potential abstracts and titles.
Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and
repeat extraction by a third reviewer (Zheng MH).

Study quality
Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of
the methodology by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool,
an established tool based on assessing sequence generation
for the randomization of subjects, allocation concealment
of treatment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective
outcome reporting and other sources of bias [69]. Trials
with high or unclear risk for bias for any one of the first
three components were regarded as trials with high risk of
bias. Otherwise, they were considered as trials with low
risk of bias.

Selection criteria
We included randomized, placebo, or untreated
controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of any single
or combination of treatments with observation or other
classes of active treatments in patients with PBC older
than 18 years old. Included studies had to report at least
one of two outcomes: MOLT and adverse events (AEs).
PBC was diagnosed according to established diagnostic
criteria (at least three of the following criteria: alkaline
phosphatase and (or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase above
the upper limit of normal; antimitochondrial antibodies
positive at a titer of 1:40; absence of biliary obstruction by
ultrasonography or other radiological tests; or compatible
liver biopsy). Other exclusions were trials that comprised
a non-randomized design, reviews or pooled-analyses and
assessments of other therapies and studies with no usable
outcomes data. Duplications were eliminated for the same
title, author list or publication date. Eligible studies had to
be published as full length articles.

Data analysis
All data from each eligible study were extracted
and entered into a standardized spreadsheet (Microsoft
Excel 2007; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). We analyzed
two treatment outcomes separately (MOLT, AE). Firstly,
traditional pairwise meta-analyses were conducted for
studies that directly compared different treatment arms.
Then we performed Bayesian network meta-analyses to
compare different PBC therapies.
Firstly, we performed traditional pairwise metaanalyses for studies that directly compared different
treatment arms with STATA 12.0 (Stata Corporation,
College Station, Texas, USA). We calculated, by using
the method of DerSimonian and Laird random effects
model, of hazards ratios, the pooled estimates of odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals of direct comparisons
between two strategies according to Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0.
Clinical heterogeneity was first assessed through clinical
judgment with input from experts in the field. Statistical

Data extraction
Two investigators (Zhu GQ, Shi KQ) independently
extracted data from each study and enter it into a database.
Any discrepancies regarding the extraction of data were
resolved by additional investigator (Zheng MH). Data
were extracted from each study with a predesigned
electronic database, including publication data (the

heterogeneity was then assessed by the P values of Egger’s
and Begg’s test from pair-wise meta-analysis, which was
higher than 0.05 suggesting heterogeneity. A formal
assessment of heterogeneity was then accomplished by
referring to the I2 statistic. According to the standard
guidelines, I2 values greater than 50% are considered
high heterogeneity levels, between 25-50% moderate and
less than 25% considered low heterogeneity levels. Once
the heterogeneity was suspected, sensitivity analysis was
employed [70]. It was conducted based on the important
covariate, the dose of UDCA, to investigate the robustness
of our main analyses. The sensitivity analysis for dose of
UDCA included trials that patients administrated by a
dose of 13-15 mg/kg/day, according to AASLD practice
guidelines in 2009 [59].
In addition to the direct comparison meta-analyses,
we performed multiple-treatment meta-analysis with a
random-effects model within a Bayesian framework using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in WinBUGS (MRC
Bio- statistics Unit, Cambridge, UK). The advantages
of using a bayesian analytical approach are that direct
probability statements on treatment comparisons can be
made and that all evidence for a specific problem can be
taken into account as it includes evidence on both indirect
and direct comparisons and as such allows estimation of
the comparisons between interventions that have not been
examined directly in previous trials [16, 18]. The pooled
estimates were obtained using the Markov chains Monte
Carlo method. As we have described in our previous
published network meta-analysis [2, 26, 30, 39], analyses
were based on non-informative priors for relative-effect
parameters (flat normal with mean of 0 and precision of
0.001) and between-study SD (a flat uniform distribution
between 0 and 2). Convergence and lack of autocorrelation
were checked and confirmed after a 5000-simulation
burn-in phase without any thinning and using 4 chains
with different initial values. Then, a burn-in phase of 20
000 iterations was used, followed by 50 000 iterations to
estimate parameters. This method combined direct and
indirect evidence for any given pair of treatments in one
joint analysis [71-72].
We compared the pooled HRs from the network
meta-analysis with corresponding HRs from pair-wise
random-effects meta-analysis of direct comparisons to
assess whether there was inconsistency between direct
and indirect comparisons. Odds ratios (ORs) were
calculated from the number of total patients and the
number of patients in each trial for network meta-analysis
for AEs. In addition, to estimate inconsistency, we used
the node splitting method to calculate the inconsistency
of the model, which separated evidence on a particular
comparison into direct and indirect evidence [72].
Bayesian P value was also reported and evaluated between
the direct and indirect evidence [72].
The treatments were ranked for each outcome
in each simulation on the basis of their posterior
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

probabilities. We assessed the probability that each
treatment was the most efficacious regimen, the second
best, the third best and so on, by calculating the HR for
each treatment compared with an arbitrary common group
and counting the proportion of iterations of the Markov
chain in which each treatment had the highest HR, the
second highest, and so on. Even though the differences
in effect size among treatments may be small, clinical
decisions about the choice of treatments can still be
suggested based on the probabilities of treatment ranking
[26, 73]. The outcome of AEs was also reported as odds
ratios with corresponding 95% credible intervals, as well
as the probabilities of ranking by treatment. Therefore,
the network meta-analysis increased statistical power
by incorporating evidence from both direct and indirect
comparisons across all treatments.
