BACKGROUND: Reduced melanoma risk has been reported with regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the ability of NSAIDs to reach melanocytes in vivo and modulate key biomarkers in preneoplastic lesions such as atypical nevi
has not been evaluated. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sulindac was conducted in individuals
with atypical nevi (AN) to determine bioavailability of sulindac and metabolites in nevi and effect on apoptosis and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in AN. Fifty subjects with AN 4 mm in size and 1 benign nevus (BN) were randomized to
sulindac (150 mg twice a day) or placebo for 8 weeks. Two AN were randomized for baseline excision, and 2 AN and BN were excised
after intervention. RESULTS: Postintervention sulindac, sulindac sulfone, and sulindac sulfide concentrations were 0.31  0.36, 1.56 
1.35, and 2.25  2.24 lg/mL in plasma, and 0.51  1.05, 1.38  2.86, and 0.12  0.12 lg/g in BN, respectively. Sulindac intervention did
not significantly change VEGFA expression but did increase expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 in AN (increase of
3  33 in sulindac vs decrease of 25  45 in the placebo arm, P ¼ .0056), although significance was attenuated (P ¼ .1103) after
adjusting for baseline expression. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of sulindac intervention resulted in high concentrations of sulindac sulfone, a proapoptotic metabolite, in BN but did not effectively modulate VEGFA and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Study limitations
included limited exposure time to sulindac and the need to optimize a panel of biomarkers for NSAID intervention studies. Cancer

KEYWORDS: melanoma, prevention and control, chemoprevention, nevus, anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal, atypical nevi.

Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in women in the United States, with 70,230 newly
diagnosed cases and 8790 deaths anticipated in 2011.1 Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure remains the major environmental risk factor, and incidence continues to increase despite public health initiatives promoting sun protection. The
increasing incidence of melanoma and its poor prognosis in advanced stages mandate the investigation of novel primary
prevention approaches such as chemoprevention. To date, limited intervention trials have been conducted to evaluate
potential chemopreventive agents for melanoma prevention.2-4 Individuals with atypical or dysplastic nevi have been targeted for chemoprevention efforts, because dysplastic nevi are the most important clinical marker of increased melanoma
risk and can also serve as potential precursor lesions.5-8
Preclinical studies suggest that certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cell proliferation and
induce growth inhibition in melanoma cell lines.9,10 NSAIDs have also been shown to suppress tumor growth of melanoma cells implanted in surgical wounds11 and augment the antitumor effect of interleukin-1 alpha or interferon-gamma
on mouse models of melanoma.12,13 Recent epidemiological studies suggest that regular use of NSAIDs reduces the risk
of melanoma, although there are some inconsistencies in the data between studies.14-18 Controlled intervention trials are
clearly warranted to define the role of NSAIDs for melanoma prevention.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of sulindac to evaluate its potential activity for
melanoma prevention in individuals with multiple atypical nevi (AN). We prioritized sulindac over other NSAIDs for
evaluation in the melanoma prevention setting, because it demonstrates a broad spectrum of anticancer activity and

possesses pharmacokinetic characteristics that are likely to
have favorable drug distribution to the skin after oral
administration. In addition, sulindac has demonstrated
bioactivity in the skin in rodent models following oral
administration.19-21 We hypothesized that sulindac intervention can result in distribution of sulindac and related
metabolites to the target tissue and favorable changes in
surrogate endpoint biomarkers in AN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Subjects

A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled intervention trial was conducted in healthy men and women at
risk for melanoma, who were randomly assigned to receive
either sulindac (150 mg twice a day [BID]) or placebo for
8 weeks. Adults between 18 and 65 years of age with at
least 4 clinical AN and 1 benign nevus (BN) suitable for
biopsy and measuring at least 5 mm in size were eligible to
participate. Subjects were recruited from the Pigmented
Lesion Clinics at the Arizona Cancer Center/University of
Arizona, Tucson, Ariz, and Stanford University Medical
Center and Cancer Institute, Palo Alto, Calif. Individuals
were considered ineligible if the following exclusion criteria were identified: contraindication to prolonged
NSAIDS intake; more than 1 prior invasive cutaneous
melanoma (1 prior stage I, IIa, or IIb melanoma permissible if off treatment for >3 months); family history of 2
first-degree relatives with melanoma; modified dermoscopy score of >4.8 for the selected AN; histological diagnosis of melanoma on baseline biopsy; pregnant or
nursing women; use of tanning beds within 6 months of
study entry; and unwilling to minimize exposure to sunlight while enrolled. Sulindac and placebo tablets were
supplied by the Division of Cancer Prevention of the
National Cancer Institute. The study was approved by the
institutional review boards at the University of Arizona
and Stanford University. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Study Procedures

During the initial visit, participants underwent eligibility
evaluation, including an interview and physical exam to
obtain medical history, performance status, height,
weight, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. A blood
sample was collected for complete blood count with differentials and comprehensive metabolic panel. A dermatologic examination was performed to determine whether
the participants had more than 4 large AN and 1 BN.
Study AN were selected by clinical evaluation using
unaided visual inspection following the definition proCancer

posed by the World Health Organization in 1990: 5
mm in size, must include a macular component in at least
1 area and have at least 2 of the following features: illdefined borders, color variegation, and uneven contour.
The study AN were required to measure 5 mm and <15
mm. Epiluminescent microscopy (ELM) examination
was performed using the pattern analysis and modified
ABCD rule (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, and dermoscopic structures) algorithms to obtain
a modified dermoscopy score.22 These criteria were used
to select 4 clinically AN, 1 BN (consistent with a compound or intradermal common nevus), and to exclude
lesions suspicious for melanoma or severe dysplasia.
The selected 4 study AN were numbered according
to a fixed schema and photographed (standard and ELM
photos), with 2 lesions randomized for baseline evaluation
and 2 for postintervention evaluation. The 2 lesions
assigned to baseline evaluation were removed by excisional biopsy for histological and biomarker evaluation.
Each AN was bisected, with half oriented, embedded in
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, frozen to
preserve histological features, and then stored at 80 C.
The other half was immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours and then transferred to 70%
ethanol prior to routine processing and paraffin
embedding.
A board-certified dermatopathologist immediately
processed and provided the initial histological report on the
baseline AN. Once any concerning melanocytic proliferations were excluded after pathologic analysis, study subjects
were randomized (1:1, 25 per arm) to receive sulindac (150
mg BID) or placebo (BID) intervention for 8 weeks.
Participants returned to the clinic after 4 weeks of
agent intervention for adherence and safety evaluation. During this interim visit, the subjects returned the remaining
study agent, intake calendar, and adverse event (AE) diary.
After review of the documents, the subjects were given a
new supply of study agent, intake calendar, and AE diary.
Upon completion of the intervention at 8 weeks, the
remaining 2 study AN were similarly evaluated for clinical
changes by ELM using the pattern analysis and modified
ABCD rule algorithms and then photographed. The AN
were surgically excised for postintervention evaluation.
The BN was also removed for determination of sulindac
and sulindac metabolite concentrations. Postintervention
AN were processed as described above. The BN was
excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored
at 80 C. A blood sample was collected for determination of plasma sulindac and sulindac metabolite concentrations. A blood sample was also collected for complete

blood count with differentials and comprehensive metabolic panel.
Quantification of Sulindac and Its Metabolites in
Plasma and Skin Biopsies

Plasma concentrations of sulindac and its metabolites
were quantified using a high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
method developed in our laboratory.23 For the skin biopsies, the sample was weighed and homogenized in 0.2 M
perchloric acid. An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed
with the internal standard solution and then extracted
with dichloromethane. The organic layer was collected,
processed, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS in a similar fashion as the plasma samples.23
Determination of Vascular Endothelial Growth
Factor A Expression and Cleaved Caspase-3 in
AN

The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) and cleaved caspase-3 was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Tissue blocks were sectioned at 4 lm followed by deparaffinization and
rehydration. For VEGFA, tissue slides were stained with
anti-VEGFA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif;
catalog #7269, 1:50 dilution) using an overnight incubation, and antigen retrieval was performed with Tris/borate/
EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) (TBE; Biocare
Medical, Concord, Calif) buffer (pH 9). For cleaved caspase-3, tissue slides were stained with anti–cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass; catalog #9661)
at a 1:800 dilution overnight while antigen retrieval was performed with Diva Decloaker buffer (Biocare Medical). Positive controls included UVB-irradiated HaCat cells and
angiosarcoma or a brain melanoma used for VEGFA.
UVB-irradiated HaCat cells that were formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded, UVB-irradiated abdominal skin, and
tonsil tissue were used for cleaved caspase-3.
For VEGFA and cleaved caspase-3, IHC was performed using a red alkaline phosphatase indirect biotin
strepavidin system (Vector Labs) and a hematoxylin counterstain (Surgipath), and were hand-stained. Melanocytes
were detected through Melan-A stain.
IHC staining was evaluated by an expert dermatopathologist to determine the intensity of the stain (defined
as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by intensity).
Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0
was no staining, 1 was weak, 2 was moderate, and 3 was
strong. Individual scores were generated for both cytoplasmic and nuclear components of keratinocytes, junctional
melanocytes, and dermal melanocytes.

Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was to determine the bioavailability of sulindac and sulindac metabolite in the target tissue,
measured by postintervention nevus sulindac and sulindac
metabolite concentrations. The secondary endpoints
included assessment of cleaved caspase-3, a protein
marker of apoptosis, and VEGF expression in AN and
determination of plasma sulindac and metabolite levels.
VEGF and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels for each
lesion were derived by multiplying the intensity score (03) with the associated percentage (0%-100%). For each
participant, the average expression over all baseline lesions
and all postintervention lesions, respectively, were calculated to perform comparisons between the intervention
groups. Descriptive statistics were performed on each of
the endpoints within each intervention group. The distributions for some of the endpoints were not symmetrical.
Therefore, a 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to test if the changes from baseline to postintervention in each of the endpoints, including VEGF and
cleaved caspase-3 expression levels and the dermoscopy
score, differed by the intervention groups. Fisher’s exact
tests were performed to compare the histological diagnosis
of the study nevi between the intervention groups and
between baseline and postintervention analyses.
RESULTS
Consent was obtained from 51 subjects between February
2009 and July 2010, and only 1 subject failed to meet
inclusion criteria. Study subject characteristics are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the majority of the subjects were Caucasian. The mean age of the subjects was
46.4 years in the sulindac group and 45.9 years in the placebo group, with a male:female distribution of 13/12 and
15/10 in the sulindac and placebo groups, respectively.
The majority of the enrolled subjects (23 of 25) in the
sulindac arm had atypical mole syndrome following the
definition by Slade et al,24 whereas all subjects (25 of 25)
in the placebo group demonstrated this phenotype. In
addition, 14 subjects in the sulindac arm had a prior history of 1 primary invasive melanoma compared with 8
subjects in the placebo group.
Tolerability, Adherence, and Safety of Oral
Sulindac Administration in Patients With AN

Study subjects were closely monitored for potential AEs
for the duration of the study. For those AEs recorded as
‘‘possibly or probably related’’ to study agents, grade 1
heartburn was the most common symptom with 16% (n
¼ 4) of subjects in the sulindac group and 8% (n ¼ 2) of
subjects in the placebo group affected (Table 2). One

this last case, the diagnosis of mild hypertension was
established at the time of the annual physical examination,
which took place while the subject was in the study.
Because the subject’s baseline blood pressure was within
normal limits at the initial study visit, the event was considered as possibly related to the intervention. A compliance rate of 100% was achieved in the study, because all
subjects reported >80% study agent intake throughout
the course of the study.

VEGFA

Keratinocytic component

The expression of VEGFA and cleaved caspase-3 was
assessed according to the cell of origin and architectural
location of the melanocytic cells (Fig. 2). Table 5 summarizes the expression of these biomarkers for all study nevi
that were deemed clinically atypical. The baseline expression of VEGFA and cleaved caspase-3 was similar between
the 2 study groups. VEGFA expression was high in the
melanocytic junctional component followed by the melanocytic dermal component and the keratinocytes. Cleaved
caspase-3 was primarily expressed in the melanocytic
junctional component. Eight weeks of agent intervention
did not result in significant changes in VEGFA and
cleaved caspase-3 expression when analyzed for all study
nevi (Table 5).
Similarly, when the melanocytic nevi were classified
as dysplastic histologically, the baseline expression of
VEGF-A was not different between the 2 study groups,
and 8 weeks of agent intervention did not result in significant changes in VEGFA expression (Table 6). When evaluating the baseline expression of cleaved caspase-3 in
junctional melanocytes in the sulindac arm corresponding
to dysplastic nevi, a significantly lower level of expression

DISCUSSION
AN are the most important clinical risk factor for melanoma and may serve as nonobligate biologic intermediates
in melanoma tumorigenesis, making them useful for
early-phase candidate chemoprevention trials. Our phase
2a randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated
that sulindac and sulindac metabolites were bioavailable
in the skin, specifically in BN following oral administration. Sulindac sulfone, a proapoptotic metabolite, reached
the target tissue at concentrations similar to the respective
plasma concentrations. The nevus distribution of sulindac
sulfide, the metabolite responsible for cyclooxygenase inhibition, was limited. Eight weeks of sulindac intervention did not result in significant changes in VEGF
expression, but it resulted in a marginal modulation of a
marker of apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3, in the melanocytic
junctional component in DN. This borderline effect
could be due to small sample size (with only 20 subjects in
the sulindac arm and 21 in the placebo arm with evaluable
DN data) or relatively short duration of the intervention.
However, this finding should be explored further, because
possible induction of apoptosis with sulindac intervention
would be consistent with the observed identification of
high concentrations of sulindac sulfone in the nevi.

Prior studies have evaluated the effect of topical tretinoin (retinoic acid analog) on AN as a surrogate marker
for the chemoprevention of melanoma.25-28 Although
some of these studies demonstrated significant histologic
change toward a benign state, the endpoint of evaluating
degree of histological dysplasia was complication by the
resulting inflammatory response from topical application
of retinoid to a large segment of the back where the study
nevi were located. In addition, a small pilot study examined the effect of topical imiquimod on AN.29 There were
no obvious clinical changes in the size and morphology of
the study nevi after 16 weeks of imiquimod 5% cream
applied 3 times per week. Histologically, 4 of 14 treated
nevi showed a significant reduction of junctional and
intraepidermal melanocytes suggestive of partial regression, compared with untreated nevi.
Despite potential activity, topical application of
melanoma preventive agents imposes a number of limitations. Most importantly, although there are certain anatomical sites that are known to be at higher risk of
developing melanoma according to sex and subtype of
melanoma, most melanomas arise de novo and not from
precursor nevi (whether common, congenital, or dysplastic), and so targeting selected nevi on the skin may prove
to be less effective for melanoma prevention compared
with a systemic approach.
Prior studies have evaluated oral isotretinoin26 and
beta-carotene30 in patients with dysplastic nevi but failed
to demonstrate activity. We conducted the current study
to evaluate the potential activity of NSAIDs for melanoma prevention, because recent epidemiological studies
suggest that regular use of NSAIDs, particularly aspirin,
reduces the risk of melanoma.14-18 We elected to study
sulindac because it demonstrates a broad spectrum of anticancer activity and well-documented safety. Given the
long prescription history of this agent, adverse reactions
can be minimized with knowledge of the established predisposing risk factors, including but not limited to history
of adverse reaction to any NSAID and active gastrointestinal disease.
The anti-inflammatory activity of sulindac is
believed to be mostly through inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis by the sulfide metabolite.31,32 Sulindac sulfone
possesses minimal activity toward cyclooxygenase; however, it has been shown to be a proapoptotic compound.
In melanoma cell lines, both sulindac metabolites are
effective in reducing the number of viable cells.33 The
decrease in cell viability is accompanied by an induction
of apoptosis, measured by morphological changes and
fragmented DNA in cell lysates.33

Sulindac Chemoprevention in Melanoma/Curiel-Lewandrowski et al

Because of their long half-lives and high lipophilicity,34 sulindac metabolites may distribute to the skin to a
greater extent than other NSAIDs and thus may be better
candidates for skin cancer prevention. In preclinical studies, oral administration of sulindac at physiological concentrations has shown biological activities in the skin.19-21
As we demonstrated, sulindac metabolites are bioavailable
in the skin after oral sulindac administration, with sulindac sulfone showing favorable nevi distribution, which
correlated with the observed changes in the apoptotic
marker.
Reduced VEGF production and gene activation are
among the proposed mechanisms of NSAID-induced inhibition of angiogenesis.35,36 Melanoma cells have been
shown to strongly express VEGF (or VEGFA), whereas
benign melanocytic nevi and melanocytes are largely
thought not to express VEGF.37-41 Expression of other
VEGF family members has also been described in melanoma.42,43 Our research group previously showed that
VEGF expression in melanocytic cells was low or absent
in BN, increased significantly in dysplastic nevi, and was
further increased in primary melanoma.44 Collectively,
these studies suggest that angiogenesis may be an early
event of melanocytic lesion progression and could be a
useful target for melanoma prevention. In our study,
VEGF expression was not modulated with 8 weeks of
sulindac intervention. Further studies are needed to determine whether a longer duration of NSAID intervention
would affect these findings.
An important outcome of our study relates to the
feasibility of conducting this type of intervention in individuals at risk for melanoma. We were able to recruit the
target cohort of 50 subjects within 16 months from 2 geographically distinct study sites. In addition, the introduction of dermoscopy-based algorithms for selection of
study AN appears to effectively improve the clinicopathologic correlation. A pattern analysis–based algorithm was
used to enhance the sensitivity of selecting AN while the
ABCDE clinical algorithm (ABCD algorithm, with addition of ‘‘evolving lesion’’) was implemented with the
objective of excluding concerning melanocytic lesions.
Overall, 73.4% of AN were histologically classified as dysplastic, which demonstrates high clinicopathologic correlation compared with other studies.45
Potential limitations of the study are the small sample size and short intervention duration for assessing tissue
biomarker and pathological changes, because the study
was designed and powered for the primary endpoint. The
identification of optimal and reproducible biomarkers to
assess the effect on sulindac and other NSAIDs in melanoCancer

cytic nevi requires further evaluation. An important consideration for future studies will be to clinically target AN
that represent a compound melanocytic process in order
to increase the likelihood of identifying a junctional and
dermal component for the evaluation of biomarkers. In
addition, more subjects in the sulindac arm had a prior
history of melanoma, which may affect the tissue biomarker expression. Although we did not find a significant
difference in baseline tissue biomarker expression in subjects with or without prior melanoma (data not shown),
stratification based on prior melanoma history may still
be an important consideration for future clinical trial
design.
We conclude that sulindac and sulindac metabolites
can reach measurable levels in melanocytic nevi after oral
sulindac administration, with the proapoptotic compound sulindac sulfone showing favorable nevi distribution. Eight weeks of sulindac intervention demonstrated a
marginal effect in the expression of a marker of apoptosis
in dysplastic nevi and did not result in significant changes
in VEGF expression. The study findings support the further evaluation of sulindac as a chemopreventive agent for
melanoma.
