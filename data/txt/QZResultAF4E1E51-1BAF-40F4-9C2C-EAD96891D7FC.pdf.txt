Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) overexpression is frequently
found in ovarian and other cancers and is predictive of poor
clinical outcome. In the current study, we characterized the
biological and therapeutic effects of a novel FAK inhibitor,
TAE226. Taxane-sensitive (SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8) and taxaneresistant (HeyA8-MDR) cell lines were used for in vitro and
in vivo therapy experiments using TAE226 alone and in
combination with docetaxel. Assessment of cytotoxicity, cell
proliferation [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)],
angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (terminal nucleotidyl
transferase–mediated nick end labeling) were done by
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. In vitro,
TAE226 inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK at both Y397
and Y861 sites, inhibited cell growth in a time- and dosedependent manner, and enhanced docetaxel-mediated growth
inhibition by 10- and 20-fold in the taxane-sensitive and
taxane-resistant cell lines, respectively. In vivo, FAK inhibition
by TAE226 significantly reduced tumor burden in the HeyA8,
SKOV3ip1, and HeyA8-MDR models (46–64%) compared with
vehicle-treated controls. However, the greatest efficacy was
observed with concomitant administration of TAE226 and
docetaxel in all three models (85–97% reduction, all P values
<0.01). In addition, TAE226 alone and in combination with
chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival in tumorbearing mice. Even in larger tumors, combination therapy
with TAE226 and docetaxel resulted in tumor regression.
The therapeutic efficacy was related to reduced pericyte
coverage, induction of apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells, and reduced microvessel density and tumor cell
proliferation. The novel FAK inhibitor, TAE226, offers an
attractive therapeutic approach in ovarian carcinoma. [Cancer

Introduction

chemotherapeutic approaches, the resistance of cancer cells to
traditional cytotoxic agents is a major obstacle in clinical cancer
therapy, and most patients eventually succumb to their disease (2).
Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches for ovarian cancer are
needed.
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125-kDa non-receptor protein
tyrosine kinase that was first identified in Src-transformed
fibroblasts (3). FAK is overexpressed in many tumors, including
those derived from the head and neck, colon, breast, prostate, liver,
and thyroid (4–13). We have previously shown that FAK is
overexpressed in a substantial proportion of ovarian cancers and
is predictive of poor clinical outcome. The overexpression of FAK
may be related to FAK gene amplification (14). FAK has been
shown to play a significant role in cell survival, migration, and
invasion (15–19). For example, decreased FAK phosphorylation by
the dominant negative FAK-related non-kinase resulted in reduced
migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro (18, 20, 21).
FAK overexpression has also been suggested to protect cells from
stressors such as chemotherapy by activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase–AKT survival pathway, activation of nuclear factornB, and induction of inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (22). We have
previously shown that FAK is cleaved after treatment with
docetaxel chemotherapy in a caspase-3–dependent manner, and
that FAK down-regulation promoted docetaxel cytotoxicity in
ovarian cancer cells (23). Moreover, in vivo FAK silencing using
small interfering RNA (siRNA) incorporated in a neutral nanoparticle resulted in antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in
orthotopic models of ovarian carcinoma (24). In both studies,
FAK silencing enhanced the effects of chemotherapy (23, 24).
Although siRNA-based therapeutic approaches are gradually being
developed for human use, small-molecule inhibitors have been
developed against many targets and have been integrated into
clinical trials. Based on the known role of FAK in ovarian cancer
pathogenesis and the encouraging results with FAK gene silencing,
we tested the efficacy of a novel FAK inhibitor, TAE226, in multiple
ovarian cancer models.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related
deaths in women and the most frequent cause of death from a
gynecologic malignancy (1). Despite advances in surgical and

Cell lines and culture conditions. The derivation, source, and
propagation of the human ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8,
have been described previously (25). The taxane-resistant cell line, HeyA8MDR, was a kind gift from Dr. Isaiah Fidler (The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 300 Ag/mL of paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company). Because
there are no true human pericyte cell lines, we used a pericyte-like cell line,
10T1/2. These cells represent undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and have

treating cells with 1 Amol/L of TAE226, lysates were collected at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h and then analyzed for down-regulation of pFAK at residue Y397. C, lysates
from collagen I–coated and noncoated plates were also examined by Western blot analysis for pFAKY861. B and C, show band intensity of pFAK relative to FAK.

previously been used as presumptive mural cell precursors (26). All in vitro
experiments were conducted with 70% to 80% confluent cultures.
Reagents. Leupeptin, aprotinin, and sodium orthovanadate were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company; EDTA was obtained from Life
Technologies Invitrogen; and docetaxel was obtained from Sanofi-Aventis.
The FAK inhibitor, TAE226, was obtained from Novartis Pharma AG
(Fig. 1A; ref. 27). TAE226 inhibits the FAK kinase domain with an IC50 of
0.0055 Amol/L in in vitro kinase assays (27). The primary antibodies used
were mouse anti-FAK (Biosource International), anti–phospho-FAK [Y397]
(Biosource), anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti–matrix metalloproteinase-9 (anti–MMP-9; ChemiconMillipore), mouse anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (anti-PCNA) clone
PC10 (DAKO), mouse anti-CD31 (PharMingen) and mouse anti-desmin
(DAKO). The following secondary antibodies were used for colorimetric
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) F(ab’)2 and HRPconjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.),
biotinylated mouse anti-goat antibody (Biocare Medical), HRP-conjugated
streptavidin (DAKO), HRP-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2a (Serotec Harlan
Bioproducts for Science, Inc.), and fluorescent Alexa 488–conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes Invitrogen).
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysate for SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis for FAK expression was prepared as previously reported (24). To
prepare lysate from dissected in vivo tumors, samples were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen immediately after sacrificing the animals and stored at
80jC. The lysate was incubated on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer for 2 h before being homogenized using a mortar and pestle. The
homogenized sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected
and stored at 80jC. Protein quantification and Western blot for FAK were
done as previously reported (24). Equal loading was confirmed with h-actin
(0.1 Ag/mL, Sigma Chemical). Densitometric analysis was done using the

Scion Imaging software (Scion Corporation), using total FAK or actin as a
control for each sample.
Cytotoxicity assay. The IC50 was determined as described previously
(23). Briefly, 2,000 cells per well were seeded onto 96-well plates and allowed
to adhere overnight, after which the FAK inhibitor, TAE226, was added.
Twenty-four hours after incubation, the media was exchanged for one
containing increasing concentrations of docetaxel dissolved in ethanol.
After 96 h of docetaxel exposure, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was done. The absorbance at 570 nm was
recorded, and the IC50 was determined.
Animal care and orthotopic implantation of tumor cells. Female
athymic mice (NCr-nu) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute–
Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. The mice were housed
and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in facilities
approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care and in accordance with the current regulations and standards
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, and the NIH. All studies were approved and supervised by
the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. The mice used in these experiments were 8 to
12 weeks old.
To produce tumors, SKOV3ip1, HeyA8-MDR cells (both 1  106 cells per
0.2 mL HBSS; Life Technologies Invitrogen), or HeyA8 cells (2.5  105 cells
per 0.2 mL HBSS) were injected i.p. into the mice. For in vivo experiments,
cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for
7 min at 4jC. Cells were then washed twice before being reconstituted in
HBSS. Only single-cell suspensions with >95% viability, as determined by
trypan blue exclusion, were used for the in vivo injections. Mice (n = 10 per
group) were monitored daily for adverse effects of therapy and were
sacrificed on day 35 (SKOV3ip1), day 28 (HeyA8 or HeyA8-MDR), or when
any of the mice seemed moribund. Total body weight, tumor incidence and

mass, and the number of tumor nodules were recorded. In animals bearing
SKOV3ip1 tumors, the volume of malignant ascites was recorded. Tumors
were either fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin or snap frozen in
optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.) in
liquid nitrogen.
Therapy for established i.p. tumors in nude mice. Before evaluating
the therapeutic effect of TAE226 combined with docetaxel in our mouse
model, we first did preliminary dose-response experiments for TAE226.
Seventeen days after HeyA8 cell inoculation (when i.p. tumors were
palpable), a single i.p. dose (PBS or TAE226 15, 30, and 100 mg/kg) was
given. Three mice from each treatment group were randomly sacrificed 8,
24, or 48 h after treatment, and tumors were collected for IHC.
To determine the antitumor effects of TAE226, SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and
HeyA8-MDR, tumor cells were injected i.p., and therapy with one of four
regimens was initiated 7 days later. Treatment regimens were as follows:
vehicle, TAE226 30 mg/kg p.o. daily, docetaxel 2 mg/kg (SKOV3ip1) or
2.5 mg/kg (HeyA8 and HeyA8-MDR) i.p. weekly, or TAE226 daily combined
with docetaxel weekly.
Immunohistochemistry. Phosphorylated FAK (pFAK[Y397]) was
assessed by IHC. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were heated
and then deparaffinized using xylene and declining grades of ethanol before
being rehydrated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidases
were blocked with 6% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Nonspecific epitopes
were blocked with 5% normal horse serum and 1% normal goat serum for
30 min. All sections were then incubated with anti-pFAK[Y397] antibody
(1:25) overnight at 4jC. After washing with PBS followed by Optimax buffer,
the appropriate secondary antibody was applied, and visualization was
done using the Vectastain ABC detection kit (Vector Labs) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The chromogenic reaction was done with 3,3¶diaminobenzidine (DAB, Phoenix Biotechnologies).
VEGF, MMP-9, and PCNA IHC analyses were done as previously
described (28). Briefly, after deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen
retrieval was done using either heated citrate buffer (0.1 mol/L; pH, 6.0) in a
microwave (MMP-9, PCNA) or pepsin in a 37jC humidified incubator
(VEGF). Endogenous peroxidases and nonspecific epitopes were blocked
with 3% H2O2/methanol and 5% normal horse serum with 1% normal goat
serum, respectively. Slides were then incubated with the appropriate
primary antibody at the following dilutions: VEGF, 1:100; MMP-9, 1:400;
anti-PCNA, 1:50, in blocking solution overnight at 4jC. After incubating
with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to HRP, detection was
achieved with DAB substrate and counterstained with Gill’s No. 3
hematoxylin (Sigma). The proliferative index was calculated as the
percentage of PCNA-positive cells in 10 randomly selected high-power field
(HPF) at 100 per slide.
CD31 IHC was done using freshly cut frozen tissue as previously
described (23). Briefly, slides were fixed in cold acetone and then incubated
with anti-CD31 [platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1)].
Microvessel density (MVD) was quantified by counting the number
of microvessels per 100 HPF over 10 randomly selected 0.159-mm2 fields.
A microvessel was defined as a discrete CD31+ cluster or single cell adjacent
to a lumen.
Terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling assay.
Immunofluorescence staining for terminal nucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was done on frozen sections as previously
described (29). To quantify TUNEL-positive cells, the number of green
fluorescence–positive cells was counted in 10 random 0.011-mm2 fields at
400 magnification.
Bioluminescence imaging. The luciferase-transfected HeyA8 cell line
(HeyA8-Luc) was established using a Lentivirus system, as previously
described (29). Treatment with TAE226 and docetaxel was initiated 17 days
after i.p. injection with HeyA8-Luc cells (2.5  105 cells per mouse).
Bioluminescence imaging and data acquisition were done twice weekly as
previously reported (29) using the IVIS 100 imaging system coupled to the
Living Image software (Xenogen).
Immunofluorescence staining for CD31 and desmin. Freshly cut,
snap-frozen sections were double stained for CD31 and desmin as described
previously (28). Briefly, after fixation in cold acetone and blocking of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

nonspecific epitopes, sections were incubated with CD31 antibody followed
by the fluorescence-conjugated antibody. After washing with PBS, samples
were incubated with desmin antibody (1:400), followed by incubation with
fluorescence-conjugated antibody. Samples were counterstained with
Hoeschst for 5 min and mounted. Pericyte coverage was determined by
the percent of vessels with 50% or more coverage by the green fluorescence
of associated desmin-positive cells in five random fields at 200 magnification for each tumor.
Microscopic analysis. IHC-stained slides were examined with a 10
objective on a Microphot-FX microscope (Nikon) equipped with a threechip charge-coupled device color video camera (model DXC990, Sony
Corp.). Immunofluorescence microscopy was done using a 20 objective on
a Microphot-FXA microscope (Nikon) equipped with an HBO 100 mercury
lamp and narrow band-pass filters to individually select for green, red, and
blue fluorescence (Chroma Technology). Images were captured using a
cooled charge-coupled device camera (model 5810, Hamamatsu) and
Optimas Image Analysis software (Media Cybernetics).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was extracted,
and reverse transcription was done using an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney
murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies).
After PCR amplification, quantitative values were obtained, as previously
described (30). The primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems.
Statistical analyses. Differences in continuous variables were analyzed
using Student’s t test or ANOVA as appropriate. A P value V0.05 was
considered statistically significant. For values that were not normally
distributed, the Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used. Survival analyses
were done using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS, SPSS Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses.

Results
Effects of TAE226 on FAK phosphorylation and ovarian
cancer growth. Before in vivo experiments, we first tested the
in vitro effects of TAE226 on FAK phosphorylation and growth of
ovarian cancer cell lines. Given that FAK is known to bind to the h1
integrins, which consequently leads to FAK activation and
autophosphorylation, we tested the effects of TAE226 on ovarian
cancer cells plated on collagen I–coated plates (16). The expression
of pFAKY397 was significantly inhibited by TAE226 in a dosedependent manner on collagen I–coated plates and completely
suppressed on noncoated plates following treatment with TAE226
for 1 h (Fig. 1B). Although decreases in FAK phosphorylation were
noted at the 0.5-Amol/L dose, the maximal suppression occurred at
1 Amol/L. TAE226 inhibited pFAKY397 expression up to 24 h, with
gradual return of expression by 72 h (Fig. 1B). Similar results were
obtained with the HeyA8 cell line (data not shown). Because FAK
phosphorylation at Y861 is also known to potentially influence
tumor vasculature and, hence, tumorigenicity (31), we tested the
efficacy of TAE226 in inhibiting pFAKY861. TAE226 decreased pFAKY861 in a dose-dependent manner; however, doses up to
5 Amol/L were required to decrease phosphorylation at this site
(Fig. 1C).
Based on our prior data with sensitization of ovarian cancer cells
to taxanes following FAK silencing, we tested the effect of TAE226
on ovarian cancer cell growth. The IC50 with TAE226 alone was
1 Amol/L. Docetaxel cytotoxicity was 10-fold greater in combination with TAE226 compared with docetaxel alone in HeyA8 cells
(Fig. 1D) and 20-fold greater in the taxane-resistant HeyA8-MDR
cells (Fig. 1D). Similar results were observed with the SKOV3ip1
and SKOV3-TR cells (data not shown).
Effect of TAE226 on ovarian tumor growth in vivo. In light of
our in vitro data on the effect of TAE226 in sensitizing ovarian
cancer cells to docetaxel, we examined the in vivo therapeutic

potential of TAE226. Before therapy experiments, dose-finding
studies were done. Mice bearing HeyA8 tumors were given a single
p.o. dose of TAE226 at 15, 30, or 100 mg/kg and then sacrificed 8,
24, or 48 h later. The tumors were harvested, and pFAKY397
expression was assessed by Western blot and IHC. TAE226
doses of 30 mg/kg or greater significantly inhibited pFAKY397 by
24 h (Fig. 2A), with the return of expression noted by 48 h.
Total FAK levels were not affected by TAE226. Therefore, daily
administration of TAE226 at 30 mg/kg was selected as the dosing
schedule for subsequent therapy experiments.
To determine the in vivo therapeutic potential of TAE226, a
series of in vivo experiments were carried out. Female nude mice

bearing HeyA8 tumors in peritoneal cavity were randomly allocated
to one of four treatment groups (n = 10 per group): (a) daily PBS
p.o. and weekly PBS i.p. (control), (b) daily p.o. TAE226, (c) weekly
i.p. docetaxel, and (d) both TAE226 and docetaxel. Therapy
experiments were terminated when the control animals developed
signs of significant tumor burden and seemed moribund (3 to
4 weeks of therapy depending on the cell line). There was a 54% to
79% reduction in tumor burden either by TAE226 or docetaxel
monotherapy (Fig. 2B). Combination therapy resulted in the
greatest tumor reduction, with 89% reduction in the HeyA8 model
(P < 0.002 when compared with controls). The same therapy
schema was carried out in the SKOV3ip1 model, and a 97% tumor

reduction was observed in the combination group compared with
controls (P < 0.001). These were no differences in body weight,
feeding habits, or mobility between the groups.
Because chemotherapy resistance is a common problem in
ovarian carcinoma, we also did experiments with the HeyA8-MDR
model, which is resistant to several chemotherapy agents including
taxanes. Interestingly, TAE226 alone showed 46% reduction in
tumor weight even in this model (P < 0.04; Fig. 2B), but docetaxel
alone was not effective. The combination of TAE226 and docetaxel
yielded an 85% reduction in tumor growth in this model (P = 0.01)
compared with controls.
To further evaluate the effects of TAE226 therapy on metastatic
tumor growth, tumor incidence and number of nodules were
examined from the therapy experiments described above (Table 1).
Monotherapy with either TAE226 or docetaxel resulted in a modest
reduction in the number of tumor nodules in the HeyA8 and
SKOV3ip1 models, but had no effect in the HeyA8 MDR model.
However, combination therapy consistently produced fewer tumor
nodules in all groups (HeyA8: 78% reduction, P = 0.006; SKOV3ip1:
92%, P = 0.001; HeyA8-MDR: 14% reduction, P = NS). In addition, all
treatments were effective in blocking the development of ascites in
the SKOV3ip1 model: mean volume, 1.93 F 0.58 mL in controls
compared with the TAE226 (mean volume, 0.26 F 0.11 mL),
docetaxel (mean volume, 0.31 F 0.13 mL), or combination groups
(mean volume 0; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in
body weight, feeding habits, or mobility between the groups.
Based on the encouraging results with TAE226-based therapy,
we next examined its effects on survival using a moribund state as
the end point. TAE226 and docetaxel each prolonged survival compared with controls, but the combination resulted in the
greatest prolongation of survival (median 96 days; P < 0.001;
Fig. 2C).
Effects of TAE226 on established ovarian tumors. Although
the experiments described above used a model of small volume
disease, patients with recurrent cancer will frequently have larger
tumor burden. To test the effects of TAE226-based therapy on
larger tumors, we used the HeyA8-Luc cell line. Therapy was
started 2 weeks after tumor cell injection when the palpable tumor
size ranged between 0.5 and 1 cm. In the TAE226 or docetaxel

monotherapy groups, the rate of tumor growth was slower, but no
apparent tumor regression was noted. Remarkably, in the
combination group, there was 60% tumor regression noted by
15 days after initiating therapy (Fig. 2D).
Effect of pFAKY397 targeting on apoptosis, angiogenesis, and
cell proliferation. To examine potential mechanisms responsible
for the therapeutic effects of TAE226 and docetaxel, a series of
experiments were done. First, we examined tumor samples at the
conclusion of therapy for sustained FAK suppression. Indeed,
TAE226 treatment resulted in decreased pFAKY397 compared with
controls at the conclusion of therapy (Fig. 3A). Because of recent
studies (4, 32) related to FAK and tumor angiogenesis, we next
examined the effects on vessel density using CD31 immunostaining
(Fig. 3B). TAE226 and docetaxel each reduced MVD compared with
controls (P = 0.007 and 0.008, respectively). The combination of
these agents had an even greater effect on vessel density compared
with either treatment alone (P < 0.002). Based on the known FAKmediated regulation of VEGF and MMP-9 (32–34), we examined the
expression of these angiogenic factors in tumors harvested from
the various therapy groups (Fig. 3B). The expression of both VEGF
and MMP-9 was significantly lower in the TAE226-based therapy
groups, suggesting that the antitumor effect may be mediated, in
part, by suppression of angiogenesis. To further characterize the
anti-vascular mechanism, we also evaluated the effects of therapy
on tumor cell and tumor-associated endothelial cell apoptosis
(Fig. 3C and D). Tumors from vehicle-treated animals had largely
absent apoptosis in the endothelium. Apoptotic endothelial cells
were apparent in the TAE226-treated group and the docetaxeltreated group. In the combination therapy group, both endothelial
cells and tumor cells had significantly greater apoptosis compared
with all other groups (Fig. 3C).
To assess the effects of TAE226 therapy on tumor proliferation,
we did IHC analysis for PCNA (Fig. 3D). Compared with tumors
from mice receiving vehicle alone, the percentage of PCNA-positive
cells was reduced to 22 F 1.8% in tumors from mice that received
both TAE226 and docetaxel (P < 0.005). The number of PCNApositive cells was minimally reduced by treatment with TAE226
alone or docetaxel alone compared with vehicle. Finally, we
examined tumor cell apoptosis by using the TUNEL method

cells are not known. Therefore, we examined the extent of pericyte
coverage in the tumors harvested from the therapy experiments
described above. Docetaxel alone had no effect on pericyte
coverage, but the extent of pericyte coverage was significantly
lower in the TAE226 groups (Fig. 4A). It is known that pericytes
may reduce the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy by
providing local survival signals for endothelial cells. One of the
mechanisms by which pericytes may protect tumor-associated
endothelial cells is by producing VEGF locally in response to

platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)–mediated stimulation. To address whether FAK may play a role in this pathway, we
used the pericyte-like 10T1/2 cells. As expected, both PDGF-BB and
SKOV3ip1 conditioned medium (CM) stimulated VEGF mRNA
production (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, TAE226 blocked the production
of VEGF by the 10T1/2 cells despite stimulation with PDGF-BB or
SKOV3ip1-CM. Similarly, PDGF-BB treatment resulted in a
significant increase in VEGF protein production (1,055 pg/mL
versus 312 pg/mL, P < 0.01) in 10T1/2-derived conditioned media.
This increase was blocked by TAE226.

Discussion
The main findings from our study are that FAK inhibition by
TAE226 has significant therapeutic efficacy in both chemotherapysensitive and chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer models. The
therapeutic efficacy was the greatest when FAK inhibition was
combined with docetaxel and occurred by both direct effects on
tumor cells and indirect effects on the tumor vasculature.
Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly gynecologic malignancy
despite advances in chemotherapy and surgery. Although alterations in dosing and routes of administration for chemotherapy
have provided incremental improvements in the survival of
patients (36), the addition of more chemotherapy agents does
not seem to provide any further benefit. Therefore, attention has
turned toward targeting key biological pathways in both tumor
cells and the microenvironment. Targeting the VEGF pathway has
provided promising proof that antiangiogenic therapies can indeed
improve therapeutic outcomes among cancer patients (37). Initial
clinical trials with bevacizumab in ovarian cancer have shown

encouraging results (38, 39). However, it is likely that additional
targets may be required to achieve further gains in patient survival.
FAK is an attractive therapeutic target because it is a key convergence point for many growth factor pathways required for
survival and metastatic functions of cancer cells. FAK is overexpressed in a substantial proportion of ovarian cancers and is
predictive of poor clinical outcome (11, 14). FAK is also overexpressed in tumor-associated endothelial cells (40) and represents a
unique opportunity for concomitant targeting of tumor cells and
the microenvironment.
FAK is an important regulator of signaling processes between
the extracellular matrix and tumor cells (41, 42). FAK phosphorylation at Y397 follows integrin stimulation or ligand binding by
growth factor receptors (43, 44). Subsequently, phosphorylation at
Y397 promotes the Src homology domain 2 (SH2)–dependent
binding of Src-family tyrosine kinases and the formation of an
activated FAK-Src complex. FAK activation at focal adhesion sites
enhances cytoskeletal reorganization, cellular adhesion, and cell
survival (15, 45). FAK also functions in tumor cell migration and
invasion (11). However, there are a limited number of approaches
currently available for targeting FAK (31). TAE226 is a novel potent
inhibitor of FAK activity that has been shown to have therapeutic
efficacy in a glioma model (27). Remarkably, our study shows that
TAE226-based therapy was indeed effective even in chemotherapyresistant ovarian cancer models.
FAK is a particularly appealing target because it is overexpressed
in both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells (14, 40).
The effects of tumor cell FAK on the tumor microenvironment can
be mediated by the regulation of angiogenic cytokines. Sheta et al.
(46) showed that transcriptional induction of VEGF occurs via FAK.
Subsequently, Mitra et al. (33) showed that 4T1 breast cancer cells
have reduced levels of VEGF due to the inhibition of FAK activity.
We have shown that either FAK silencing or suppression of FAK
activity reduced VEGF and MMP-9 expression in vivo. This
reduction contributed to apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial
cells. However, FAK is likely to have direct functional significance
for the tumor vasculature as well. FAK is expressed in angiogenic
blood vessels of malignant astrocytomas where it facilitates
angiogenesis by enabling haptotactic migration toward ECM
proteins (47). Recently, we isolated tumor-associated endothelial
cells from human ovarian cancers and showed that FAK was
overexpressed in these cells (40). Moreover, FAK inhibition in
endothelial cells inhibited cell motility and tube formation assays
in vitro. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of FAK inhibition likely
results from both direct antitumor and anti-vascular effects. We
extend our previous findings by demonstrating an additional
mechanism whereby pericytes were also affected by the anti-FAK
therapy. Pericytes provide survival signals for endothelial cells
(26, 48). FAK is known to play an important role in PDGFstimulated pericyte migration (35). Our results indicate that FAK
inhibition results in reduced pericyte coverage, thereby providing
an additional explanation for the observed anti-vascular effects.
A potential confounding factor with the use of small-molecule
inhibitors is that several targets may be affected. For example,
TAE226 can also inhibit the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
(IGF-IR) and the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), which may
play a role in the growth of ovarian and other cancers (27, 49).
However, we have previously shown that FAK silencing in vivo
using siRNA incorporated in neutral liposomes results in
substantial antitumor activity, suggesting that FAK is indeed an
important therapeutic target (24).

FAK as a Potential Target for Therapy

In summary, we have shown that TAE226 is an effective inhibitor
of FAK activation. Moreover, inhibition of FAK phosphorylation in
combination with docetaxel effectively inhibited ovarian cancer
growth by both direct and indirect anti-vascular mechanisms.
Based on these findings, FAK represents an attractive therapeutic
target in ovarian cancer and supports further consideration of antiFAK therapies for clinical development.
