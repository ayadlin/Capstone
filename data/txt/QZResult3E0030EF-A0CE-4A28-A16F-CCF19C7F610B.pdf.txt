ABSTRACT
Previously we found that the estrogen receptor (ER) related factor ERRF regulates
cell proliferation and tumor growth, and its expression is positively associated with
ER status and better survival but inversely associated with ERBB2 (also named
HER2) status in breast cancer. Here we report that ERRF also plays an important role
in the response of ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib, a dual tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that interrupts the ERBB2 and EGFR pathway. In ERBB2-positive
breast cancer cell lines, lower levels of ERRF expression correlated with lapatinib
resistance, restoration of ERRF expression in lapatinib-resistant cell lines JIMT-1
and MDA-MB-453 enhanced their lapatinib responses, and knockdown of ERRF in
lapatinib sensitive cell lines BT-474 and SK-BR-3 caused lapatinib resistance. ERRFenhanced lapatinib sensitivity was also confirmed in xenograft tumors of JIMT-1
cells. In patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, higher level of ERRF expression
correlated with both pathologic complete response (pCR) to lapatinib and better
survival. Mechanistically, ERRF expression in resistant cells promoted lapatinibinduced apoptosis by attenuating MCL1 and ERBB2 expression. These results suggest
that ERRF plays an important role in lapatinib response of ERBB2-positive breast
cancer, and further study of ERRF could lead to improved prediction and sensitivity
of lapatinib response.

INTRODUCTION

ERBB2 targeted drugs [9, 10], because the crosstalk
between ER and ERBB2 can lead to endocrine therapy
resistance [11–14], while ERBB2-positive subtype
tumors can benefit from ERBB2 targeted drugs [15–19].
Unfortunately, patients usually develop resistance to
ERBB2 target therapies within several years [19–21]. One
of the targeted therapies is the Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that interrupts the ERBB2 and EGFR
pathway in the treatment of ERBB2 positive breast cancer,
which is used as ditosylate and orally active [22]. Lapatinib
is primarily used in patients with advanced-stage, ERBB2positive breast cancer that has stopped responding to
anthracyclines, taxanes, and herceptin [19, 23].
A number of studies have been published on the
causes of lapatinib resistance, but the mechanisms are still

The ERBB2-positive subtype of breast cancer
is characterized by gene amplification or protein
overexpression of ERBB2, a member of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor family. ERBB2 protein
is an important marker and therapeutic target for about
30% of breast cancer patients, and such patients tend to
have a shorter disease free survival and overall survival
[1–6]. In addition to the ERBB2-positive subtype of breast
cancer (ER and PR negative), the luminal B subtype is also
ERBB2 positive, but this subtype is ER and PR positive
and has different clinical characteristics and prognosis
[7, 8]. For example, the luminal B subtype cancers are
treated with endocrine therapies in combination with

not well understood, and effective therapies remain to be
developed to overcome lapatinib resistance. For example,
higher expression levels of several genes, including
ABCG2 [24], PA2G4 [25], BECN1 [26], ATG5 [26], MCL1
[27], ER [28], MET [29, 30], SPOCK1 [31], SRC [32, 33],
HIF1A [34], DUSP2 [34], MST1R [35], MAP2K1 [36],
MAP2K2 [36], FOXM1 [36], AXL [37] and YBX1 [38],
have been shown to correlate with lapatinib resistance,
but none of them can be used as diagnostic markers and
neither have any therapeutic strategies been developed
based on these molecules.
The ER related nuclear factor ERRF (C1orf64)
was first discovered in a genome-wide sequencing study
as one of the more frequently mutated genes in breast
cancer [39, 40]. In a more detailed study [41], whereas
the mutation of ERRF was not as frequent as expected,
ERRF expression was frequently elevated in breast
cancer compared to normal tissues, ERRF expression
positively correlated with ER and PR status but negatively
correlated with ERBB2 status, and knockdown of ERRF
expression reduced tumor growth of ER and PR-positive
breast cancer cells [41]. An inverse correlation between
ERRF expression and ERBB2 status was also evident
in an expression profiling study of 2000 breast cancer
specimens [42]. It is thus possible that ERRF also plays a
role in the development of ERBB2 positive breast cancer
and its resistance to ERBB2-targeted therapies.
In this study, we evaluated the relationship between
ERRF expression and the sensitivity of breast cancer cells
to lapatinib in the context of ERBB2 signaling. We found
that ERRF expression positively correlated with lapatinib
sensitivity. In cultured cells, ectopic expression of ERRF
enhanced the effect of lapatinib on cell death of JIMT1 and MDA MB-453 cells, which expressed lower levels
of ERRF and are resistant to lapatinib, while knockdown
of ERRF compromised the effect of lapatinib on BT474 and SK-BR-3 cell lines, which were sensitive to the
drug and expressed higher levels of ERRF. The effect
of ERRF on lapatinib was also confirmed in a xenograft
model at least for the JIMT-1 cell line. We also found that
ERRF attenuated the expression of ERBB2, which likely
mediated the effect of ERRF on lapatinib sensitivity.

cell lines (Figure 1B, 1C), the latter was also a lapatinib
sensitive breast cancer cell line. Lapatinib resistant
clones had been developed from both SK-BR-3 and BT474 cell lines [44], and analysis of available genomewide expression data for these resistant cells in the GEO
database [44] indicates that ERRF mRNA expression
was dramatically downregulated in the lapatinib resistant
clones of SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells (Figure 1D).
To further test the correlation between ERRF
expression and lapatinib sensitivity, we analyzed ERRF
expression and sensitivities of breast cancer cell lines to
ERBB2 drugs including lapatinib in a published study
[45] and the CCLE, and found that lapatinib sensitive cell
lines expressed significantly higher levels of ERRF than
lapatinib resistant cell lines (Figure 1E).
We also tested whether ERRF expression correlates
with prognosis in patients with ERBB2 positive breast
cancer using the BreastMark Coexpression analysis tool.
Interestingly, in 107 patients with known ERRF expression
and disease-free survival (DFS) statuses, higher levels of
ERRF expression significantly correlated with better DFS
(Figure 1F).

Restoration of ERRF expression sensitizes
lapatinib resistant ERBB2 positive breast cancer
cells to lapatinib
To test whether ERRF is functionally involved in
drug sensitivity, we restored ERRF expression by lentiviral
infection in JIMT-1, a lapatinib resistant, ERBB2 positive
breast cancer cell line that expressed a lower level of
ERRF (Figure 1E), and measured cell survival in both
2-D and 3-D cultures. Ectopic expression of ERRF
was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 2A). Stable
ERFF expression clearly enhanced the killing effect of
lapatinib on JIMT-1 cells in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 2B). In 3-D culture, stable ERFF expression
also decreased mammosphere formation of JIMT-1 cells
after lapatinib treatment, although ERRF had no effect on
sphere formation when lapatinib was absent (Figure 2C).
Consistent results were obtained in the MDA-MB-453
breast cancer cell line, which was also lapatinib resistant
and ERBB2 positive and expressed a lower level of ERRF
(Figure 2D–2F).

Induction of ERRF expression by lapatinib in

lapatinib sensitivities and better patient survival

Knockdown of ERRF expression desensitizes
ERBB2 positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib
To further test the effect of ERRF on lapatinib
sensitivity, we used two breast cancer cell lines that were
ERBB2 positive and lapatinib sensitive [22, 46] and
expressed higher levels of ERRF (Figure 1E), i.e., SKBR-3 and BT-474. ERRF expression was knocked down
by RNAi using two independent siRNAs [41], and the
effect of knockdown was confirmed by real-time PCR
(Figure 3A). CCK-8 analysis indicates that knockdown

Analysis of the Array Express database [43] showed
that in the SK-BR-3 lapatinib-sensitive breast cancer cell
line, treatment with lapatinib caused an upregulation in
ERRF expression in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1A).
We confirmed that lapatinib-mediated ERRF upregulation
was also dose dependent in both SK-BR-3 and BT-474

apoptotic response

of ERRF expression compromised the killing effect of
lapatinib on SK-BR-3 cells in a time- (Figure 3B) and
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C).
Similar results were obtained in BT-474 cells, where
ERRF knockdown had no effect on cells treated with
lower doses of lapatinib but significantly decreased drug
sensitivities when higher doses of lapatinib were applied
(Figure 3D). In 3-D culture, the effect was more profound,
as ERRF knockdown increased sphere formation by
several folds in lapatinib treated cells (Figure 3E). When
we silenced ERRF by different concentrations of siRNA
to simulate a range of expression levels similar to those
in lapatinib resistant cell lines (Figure 3F, 3H), cell
viability increased with increasing doses of ERRF siRNA
in lapatinib treated cells in a time dependent manner
(Figure 3G, 3I). The results from both SK-BR-3 and BT474 cell lines indicate that ERRF downregulation causes
a level of significantly reduced sensitivity to lapatinib
treatment in ERBB2 positive breast cancer cells.

Lapatinib treatment induces apoptosis [49], so
we examined the effect of ERRF on lapatinib-mediated
apoptosis by flow cytometry in lapatinib sensitive BT474 cells with the knockdown of ERRF (Figure 5A) and
lapatinib resistant JIMT-1 cells with ectopic expression
of ERRF (Figure 5D). Without lapatinib treatment,
stable overexpression or knockdown of ERRF had no
significant effect on apoptosis (Figure 5C, 5F). When
lapatinib treatment was applied, knockdown of ERRF
in BT-474 cells decreased the ratio of apoptotic cells
(annexin V stained) from 43.2% for control siRNA
to 11.1% for siRNA #1 and 23.1% for siRNA #2
(Figure 5B, 5C). In JIMT-1 cells treated with lapatinib,
the vector control had 19.7% of annexin V positive cells,
while cells overexpressing ERRF increased the ratio to
41.2% (Figure 5E, 5F). Therefore, ERRF expression
influences the apoptotic response of ERBB2 positive
breast cancer cells to lapatinib.

ERRF expression enhances lapatinib’s
therapeutic effect in a preclinical model and
correlates with improved clinical response to
lapatinib in patients

ERBB2 and MCL1 appear to mediate ERRF’s
effect on lapatinib sensitivity
Lapatinib can inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of
ERBB2/EGFR to inactivate the downstream signaling
pathway. In this study, we found no correlation between
ERRF and AKT and MAPK’s phosphorylation levels
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Using real-time PCR analysis,
we tested the expression levels of genes that have been
shown to correlate with lapatinib resistance in previous
studies (Supplementary Figure 1B), and found that MCL1
was one of the genes that were upregulated by ERRF
knockdown. Considering that ERRF enhances lapatinibinduced apoptosis (Figure 5), ERRF expression inversely
correlates with ERBB2 status [41], and MCL1 is not only
an anti-apoptotic gene that mediates lapatinib resistance
in HCT116 cells [50] but also an upstream regulator of
ERBB2 [51], we evaluated whether ERBB2 and MCL1
are related to ERRF in any way in breast cancer cells. We
queried breast cancer samples in the TCGA database for
those with expression information for both ERRF and
MCL1 (Supplementary Table 1), and found a significant
inverse correlation between ERRF and MCL1 (Figure 6A).
We further tested whether there was a relationship
between ERRF, MCL1, ERBB2 and lapatinib response.
In JIMT-1 cells with ERRF overexpression, we found
that treatment with 1 µM lapatinib for three days
downregulated both MCL-1 and ERBB2 compared to cells
without ERRF overexpression (Figure 6B). Consistently,
silencing ERRF with siRNAs in BT-474 cells treated
with lapatinib increased the expression of both MCL1 and ERBB2 when compared to the negative control
(Figure 6C, 6D). In BT-474 cells transfected with ERRF
siRNA, insensitivity to lapatinib was rescued by knocking

To test whether ERRF expression improves the
therapeutic response of ERBB2 positive breast cancer to
lapatinib, JIMT-1 cells stably expressing ERRF and the
vector control were subcutaneously injected into nude
mice, lapatinib treatment was applied subsequently, and
tumor growth was analyzed. During the 3 weeks of tumor
growth before lapatinib administration, ERRF expression
had no detectable effect on tumor volumes (Figure 4A).
After lapatinib treatment began, tumor growth in the
ERRF-overexpressing group was arrested or significantly
slowed from day 7 after lapatinib administration
(Figure 4A), but tumors in the control group kept
growing at the same rate before treatment. Tumor weights
(Figure 4B) and tumor images (Figure 4C) at excision
confirmed the effect of ERRF expression on the therapeutic
effects of lapatinib in JIMT-1 cells. Cell proliferation rate,
indicated by Ki67 IHC staining, was decreased in the
group of ERRF overexpression under lapatinib treatment
(Figure 4D).
In a phase II randomized study where drug activity
and safety were evaluated in ERBB2 positive operable
breast cancer, patients were treated with chemotherapy as
a neoadjuvant therapy and lapatinib as a targeted therapy
[47]. Analysis of available data in this study indicates that
ERRF expression was higher in patients with pathologic
complete response (pCR) than those without (Figure 4E).
In this study, ERRF was identified in the list of 50 genes
whose expression states predicted pCR in 93% of the test
tumor samples [48], suggesting that patients with ERBB2
positive breast cancer, higher ERRF expression predicts a
benefit from lapatinib treatment.

down MCL1 (Figure 6E, 6F), further implicating MCL1 in
ERRF-mediated lapatinib sensitivity.

ERRF expression predicts the sensitivity to lapatinib in
ERBB2 positive breast cancer. This conclusion is supported
by several lines of evidence, including the upregulation of
ERRF by lapatinib in lapatinib-sensitive SK-BR-3 and BT474 breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1A–1C), downregulation
of ERRF in lapatinib-resistant clones derived from SK-BR-3
and BT-474 cells (Figure 1D) [44], and the association of
ERRF expression with lapatinib sensitivities in breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 1E) [44]. In patients with breast
cancer, although no data is currently available for correlating
ERRF expression and lapatinib sensitivities, higher levels of
ERRF expression significantly correlated with better DFS
(Figure 1F), and ERRF was among a panel of 50 genes
predicting treatment benefit from a combination of
chemotherapy and lapatinib treatment [47].
Functionally, ERRF indeed sensitizes ERBB2
positive breast cancer to the therapeutic effects of
lapatinib. This conclusion was supported by in vitro
and in vivo experiments using both lapatinib resistant

DISCUSSION
In this study, we tested whether ERRF plays a role
in the development of resistance to ERBB2-targeted
therapies in ERBB2-positive breast cancer. We evaluated
the expression of ERRF in breast cancer in publically
available databases, and correlated ERRF expression to
responses to both ERBB2-targeted therapies and patient
survival. We also tested whether ERRF functionally
modulates the responses of ERBB2-positive breast
cancer cells to the lapatinib ERBB2 inhibitor. Finally,
we explored cellular and molecular mechanisms that
underlie the effect of ERRF on lapatinib-mediated cell
killing. Results from these analyses established ERRF
as an important regulator of ERBB2 function and the
effectiveness of ERBB2-targeted therapy.

and lapatinib sensitive cell lines with modulated ERRF
expression. In both 2-D and 3-D cell culture models,
expression of ERRF sensitizes intrinsically resistant
ERBB2 positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib
(Figure 2); and in vivo tumorigenesis assay confirmed
the effect (Figure 4). On the other hand, knockdown of
ERRF in two lapatinib-sensitive ERBB2-positive breast
cancer cell lines compromised the effect of lapatinib on
cell survival in 2-D and 3-D cultures (Figure 3), further
indicating a necessary role of ERRF in breast cancer’s
sensitivity to lapatinib.
Mechanistically, ERRF promotes lapatinib-induced
apoptosis likely by attenuating the expression of ERBB2
and its upstream regulator MCL-1. As expected, ectopic
expression of ERRF increased, while knockdown of
ERRF expression decreased, cell death induced by
lapatinib in different breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5).
Drug resistant cells usually have active anti-apoptotic
signaling, while drug sensitive cells have more active proapoptotic signaling [49, 52]. MCL1 is a member of the
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family that is upregulated in tumors,
and its upregulation leads to drug resistance [27, 50, 53].
MCL1 has been shown to upregulate ERBB2 expression
in breast cancer cells [27]. Although the relationship
between ERBB2 expression and lapatinib resistance has
not been reported, mitochondrial ERBB2 (mtERBB2)
appears to regulate cellular metabolism and therapeutic
resistance [54]. There was a correlation between ERRF

and MCL1 expression in breast cancer (Figure 6A);
and ectopic expression of ERRF decreased while the
knockdown of ERRF increased the expression of MCL1 in
breast cancer cells (Figure 6), suggesting that ERRF could
directly downregulate MCL1 expression. Taken together
with the result that knockdown of MCL1 compromised
lapatinib resistance mediated by ERRF knockdown
(Figure 6E, 6F), it is possible that ERRF downregulates
MCL1 expression to promote apoptosis in breast cancer’s
response to lapatinib. ERRF expression decreased while its
knockdown increased ERBB2 expression in breast cancer
cells as well (Figure 6), it is also possible that ERRF loss
upregulates ERBB2 including mtERBB2 to decrease
lapatinib sensitivity. Nevertheless, how ERRF regulates
lapatinib sensitivity in breast cancer cells largely remains
unknown.
ERRF is a novel regulator of breast carcinogenesis
involved in both the ER signaling and the ERBB2
signaling. We previously reported that ERRF expression
positively correlates with ER and PR statuses but
negatively associated with ERBB2 status [41], and
knockdown of ERRF inhibits the proliferation and
tumorigenesis of ER- and PR-positive breast cancer cells
[41]. In addition, ERRF is transcriptionally regulated
by the E2-ER signaling pathway in ER/PR-positive but
ERBB2-negative breast cancer cells [55]. Our current
study demonstrated that in ERBB2-positive breast
cancer, ERRF also plays an important role, as ERRF

levels of ERRF expression correlated with increased
lapatinib sensitivity and better patient survival. These
findings suggest that ERRF could be useful not only
in the prediction of lapatinib responses but also in the
improvement of lapatinib-based therapies of ERBB2positive breast cancer.

were treated with either vehicle (2% DMSO with 30%

by oral gavage for 21 days [22]. Tumor volumes were
measured every other day, and tumors were surgically
isolated from mice and weighed at the end of tumorigenesis
experiments.

Mammosphere culture
For 2-D culture, cells were plated in ultralow
attachment plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at a density
of 5,000 viable cells/mL and grown in DMEM/F-12
medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL

and 10 µg/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich). For 3-D culture,
cells were seeded into 8-well glass chamber slides
containing 40 µL growth factor-reduced matrigel per well

under a microscope following a published procedure [56].

Immunohistochemistry
After excision, tumors were formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded, deparaffinized and rehydrated; and tissue
sections were prepared following standard procedure.
Antigen retrieval was carried out by heating in sodium

that integrates gene expression and survival data from
26 datasets on 12 different microarray platforms, was used

Figure 6: ERBB2 and MCL1 are involved in ERRF mediated sensitization to lapatinib treatment. (A) Expression of ERRF

inversely correlates with that of MCL1 in breast cancer samples, as determined by the Pearson correlation analysis using data from the TCGA
database (Supplementary Table 1). (B) Overexpression of ERRF inhibits ERBB2 and MCL1 expression in the JIMT-1 ERBB2 positive
breast cancer cell line, as determined by western blotting. (C, D). Knockdown of ERRF in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line, as confirmed by
real-time PCR (C), increases ERBB2 and MCL1 expression, as determined by western blotting (D). (E, F) Knockdown of MCL1 by siRNA
transfection (50 nM) rescued decreased sensitivity of BT-474 cells to lapatinib mediated by ERRF knockdown (12.5 nM and 25 nM siRNA).
ERRF and MCL1 expression levels were examined by real-time PCR or western blotting. Con, control; #1 and #2, siRNAs against ERRF.

to associate ERRF expression with patient survival with
known ERBB2 status. The number of samples used for
analysis depends on how many platforms have probes for
a gene of interest and the availability of relevant clinical
data [57].
We also used the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE; http://www.broadinstitute.org/
ccle/home) to evaluate ERRF expression and lapatinib
sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Microarray or RNASeq-based expression data was available for all genes in
this resource. We used the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) Database (data set GSE51889) to compare SKBR-3 and BT-474 lapatinib resistant clones to control
untreated cancer cells.

The authors declare they have no conflicts of
interest.

Novelty and impact
Development of resistance and sometimes lack
of response to ERBB2-targetted therapy constitute a
significant problem in the treatment of ERBB2-positive
breast cancer. In this study, we found that expression of
ERRF, an estrogen receptor related factor, predicted the
sensitivity of ERBB2-positive breast cancers to lapatinib,
a drug used in combination with other drugs to treat either
ERBB2-positive breast cancers that have received prior
therapy or metastatic, hormone receptor positive and
ERBB2-postive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
Functionally, overexpression of ERRF sensitizes ERBB2positive breast cancer cells to lapatinib in both in vitro and
in vivo assays, and the underlying mechanism involved
ERRF-mediated expression change of ERBB2. These
findings implicate ERRF in the ERBB2 pathway and the
response of ERBB2-positive breast cancer to lapatinib,
and further studies in this area could lead to improved
detection and/or treatment of ERBB2-positive breast
cancer.
