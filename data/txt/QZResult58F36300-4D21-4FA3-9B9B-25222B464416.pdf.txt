BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study (TDM3569g) to assess the safety, tolerability,
and pharmacokinetics of single-agent trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) administered weekly and once every 3 weeks in patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab. The weekly dose results are described here. METHODS:
Patients were administered escalating doses of T-DM1 weekly, starting at 1.2 mg/kg. Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to better characterize tolerability and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received weekly
T-DM1, and the MTD was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg. In general, T-DM1 was well tolerated, requiring few dose modifications or discontinuations because of adverse events (AEs). Grade 3 AEs were reported in 19 patients (67.9%); treatment-related AEs occurred
in 25 (89.3%) patients. Exposure to weekly T-DM1 was dose-proportional at 1.2 mg/kg, and accumulation of T-DM1 and total trastuzumab was observed. Objective partial tumor responses were reported in 13 (46.4%) patients; the median duration of response was
18.6 months, and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 57.1%. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a weekly dose of T-DM1 2.4 mg/
kg has antitumor activity and is well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Cancer 2012;118:5733-40.

INTRODUCTION
Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the
humanized anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) immunoglobulin G1, trastuzumab, and DM1, a potent
microtubule inhibitory maytansine derivative, linked through a stable thioether bond.1,2 T-DM1 is unique in that its trastuzumab component has antitumor activity2 and is itself a widely used therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.
T-DM1 has been studied in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in patients with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic
breast cancer. When administered every 3 weeks, T-DM1 at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 3.6 mg/kg demonstrated antitumor activity and was well tolerated.3,4 In a randomized phase 2 study in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, this first-line T-DM1 regimen resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival and a favorable
safety profile compared with the current standard of care, trastuzumab (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) plus docetaxel (sanofi-aventis US LLC, Bridgewater, NJ).5
To assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single-agent T-DM1, we performed a phase 1, multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study (TDM3569g). In addition to different doses, this study also evaluated 2 different
T-DM1 administration schedules—weekly (qw) and once every 3 weeks (q3w)—as reports from studies of other DM1based antibody-drug conjugates suggested that qw dosing could result in increased exposure while maintaining a tolerable
safety profile.6,7 Key results from those patients who received T-DM1 qw are described herein. The results from the
patients who received T-DM1 q3w are reported elsewhere.3
METHODS
Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of T-DM1. Secondary objectives were
to assess the safety of repeated dosing, antitumor activity, and immunogenicity.

Patients

Drug Administration and Dose Escalation

This study received approval from a local human investigations committee and the Department of Health and
Human Services. Patients provided written informed consent according to federal and institutional guidelines. Eligible patients had HER2-positive (fluorescence in situ
hybridization–positive or immunohistochemistry 3þ),
histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced, or
metastatic breast cancer that had been previously treated
with chemotherapy (in the metastatic setting) and trastuzumab (in any setting). Progression no later than 60 days
after treatment with any prior trastuzumab-containing
regimen was required, as was adequate organ function and
limited prior exposure to anthracyclines (360 mg/m2 of
doxorubicin or equivalent). A detailed description of the
patient inclusion and exclusion criteria has been reported
previously.3

Evaluation of T-DM1 qw was initiated after the MTD
with T-DM1 q3w was determined. The starting dose level
for T-DM1 qw was 1.2 mg/kg, a third of the MTD of 3.6
mg/kg determined for T-DM1 q3w. Pharmacokinetic
data suggested that at doses 1.2 mg/kg, clearance was
still driven predominantly by target-mediated mechanisms. Therefore, the cumulative exposure of 3 weeks of
the 1.2 mg/kg qw regimen was predicted to be less than
that of the 3.6-mg/kg q3w regimen and was expected to
be tolerable.
Three patients initially were to be treated in each
cohort. Patients were observed for dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) during a 21-day DLT observation period. The
dose escalation schema is shown in Figure 1A. The MTD
was defined as the highest dose level that resulted in a
DLT in no more than 1 of 6 patients. After the MTD had

Weekly T-DM1 in HER2þ Breast Cancer/Beeram et al

been determined, additional patients were to be enrolled
at that dose level to better characterize tolerability and
pharmacokinetics.
Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE v3), except
for cardiac troponin I, which is not included in CTCAE
v3. A DLT was defined as a grade 3 nonhematologic,
nonhepatic major organ AE; grade 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anemia; or grade 3 increases in serum bilirubin or hepatic enzymes. The details of DLT
assessment are reported elsewhere.3 For this evaluation of
T-DM1 qw, a DLT was also defined as an AE that led the
investigator to hold treatment at either cycle 1, day 8, or
both days 15 and 22.
Safety and Response Assessments

Medical histories were obtained at baseline. Physical and
laboratory assessments were performed at baseline and
weekly thereafter. A detailed description of baseline physical and laboratory assessments has been reported.3
Left ventricular function was assessed via echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan at baseline, and
between days 15 and 21 of cycles 1 and 2, every 2 cycles
through cycle 8, every 4 cycles thereafter, and at study termination. Results were reviewed locally and at a central facility; treatment decisions were based on the local review.
Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and
every 2 cycles through cycle 8, every 4 cycles thereafter,
and at study termination. Responses were evaluated by either physical or image-based evaluation using the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.8 Any
objective responses were confirmed by repeat assessments
after 4 weeks. Duration of response (DOR) was defined
as the time from the initial response to disease progression
or death within 30 days of the last dose of T-DM1.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity
Assessments

Serum concentrations of T-DM1 (conjugated trastuzumab) and total trastuzumab (conjugated and unconjugated trastuzumab) were measured using validated
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology.
DM1 was assayed in plasma samples using electrospray
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for T-DM1, total trastuzumab, and DM1 after the first dose of T-DM1 in cycle
1 were estimated, when possible, by standard noncompartmental modeling, using WinNonlin 5.1 software
(PharSight, Sunnyvale, CA) in PharSight Knowledgebase
Server (PharSight, Sunnyvale, CA). At subsequent cycles,

peak and trough (preinfusion) concentrations were summarized using descriptive statistics. For the cohort receiving the 2.4-mg/kg dose, the area under the serum
concentration-time curve (AUC) profile for T-DM1 was
also estimated after the administration of all 3 doses in
cycle 1 (the AUC preinfusion to 21 days postinfusion
[AUC0–21d] or the AUC on the last sampling of cycle 1
[AUClast,cycle 1]).
Serum samples were assayed for the presence of
anti–T-DM1 antibodies using a bridging antibody electrochemiluminescent assay. The pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity sample collection schedule is shown in
Figure 1B.
RESULTS
Enrollment, Disposition, and Determination of
MTD

In total, 28 patients were enrolled and received treatment
with T-DM1 qw. The baseline characteristics for these
patients are presented in Table 1. Twenty-five patients
received 3 doses of T-DM1, and 3 received 3 doses
before discontinuing the study. A median of 14.5 doses
(range, 1-90 doses) was given over a median treatment duration of 18.9 weeks (range, 0-102 weeks).
T-DM1 was administered at 1.2 mg/kg, 1.6 mg/kg,
and 2.0 mg/kg for the first 3 cohorts. None of the 3
patients enrolled in each of these cohorts experienced a
DLT. Of the 6 patients who were enrolled in the subsequent 2.4-mg/kg cohort, 1 experienced a DLT (grade 2
thrombocytopenia) that led the investigator to hold dosing on day 8 of cycle 1. In addition, 2 of 3 patients who
received T-DM1 2.9 mg/kg experienced AEs preventing
retreatment on day 8 of cycle 1: grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase
(AST). Therefore, the MTD for the T-DM1 qw dosing
schedule was determined to be 2.4 mg/kg, for a cumulative dose of 7.2 mg/kg in a 21-day cycle; 16 patients were
enrolled at that dose level.
Twenty-two patients (79%) discontinued the study
prior to completing a year of study treatment, owing to
progressive disease (14 patients), AEs (3 patients), patient
decision (1 patient), physician decision (2 patients), and
other reasons (2 patients: clinical progression and ‘‘lack of
clinical benefit and requiring palliative radiation treatment’’). At the end of the study, 6 patients (21%) were
still receiving treatment (2 in the 1.2-mg/kg cohort, 1 in
the 2.0-mg/kg cohort, and 3 in the 2.4-mg/kg cohort). Of
these 6 patients, 3 continued treatment in an extension
study (TDM4259g), and the other 3 had disease progression prior to enrolling in the extension study.

Adverse Events

In general, weekly T-DM1 was well tolerated, requiring
few dose modifications and/or discontinuations because
of AEs. Regardless of relationship to study drug, at least 1
grade 3 AE was reported in 19 patients (68%); the most
common of which were anemia (14%), thrombocytopenia (11%), pneumonia (11%), and increased AST (11%).
At least 1 all-grade AE that was related to the study drug
occurred in 25 patients (89%). Study drug-related AEs
that occurred in more than 10% of patients are shown in
Table 2.
Two patients developed grade 4 AEs while receiving
the 2.4-mg/kg dose. One of these patients developed
grade 4 thrombocytopenia on day 171; it was considered
to be related to the study drug but resolved without
major sequelae. The other patient was diagnosed with
5736

pulmonary embolism on day 40, which was not considered to be related to the study drug.
DLTs were observed in 3 patients as described previously. Of the 12 serious AEs (SAEs) reported in 11
patients, 1 (grade 1 pneumonitis; 2.0-mg/kg dose level)
was considered related to the study drug. Other reported
SAEs were confusion, cellulitis, dyspnea, hepatic encephalopathy, influenza, osteomyelitis, pain, pneumonia,
and pulmonary embolism. There were 4 treatment discontinuations due to AEs: 3 patients in the 2.4-mg/kg
cohort and 1 in the 2.9-mg/kg cohort. One of these events
(grade 3 pain) was an SAE, though it was not deemed to
be related to the study drug. The other 3 events were considered to be related to the study drug (grade 3 fatigue,
grade 2 dyspnea, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia [a
DLT]).
Eleven patients experienced grade 3 laboratory
abnormalities. Those in categories not represented by the
AEs listed previously were increases in serum alkaline
phosphatase (ALP), calcium, glucose, potassium, and uric

acid, and decreases in absolute neutrophil count, and serum potassium and sodium.
Prespecified AEs of special interest included hepatic
dysfunction, gastrointestinal toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, eye disorders, pulmonary disorders, and hemorrhage.
Hepatic events (ie, those reported as increased AST, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], or ALP abnormal liver
function test; or hepatic encephalopathy) were reported in
15 patients (54%). There were no grade 4 hepatic dysfunction events, but there were 3 grade 3 events: hepatic
encephalopathy, increased AST, and increased ALT. Eye
disorders were experienced by 13 patients, 2 of whom had
grade 3 events (cataract, ocular surface disease, and punctuate keratitis). In addition, 5 pulmonary AEs were
reported, of which 3 were grade 3 pneumonia, 1 was grade
2 pneumonitis, and 1 was grade 1 pneumonitis. All 3
grade 3 events resolved with medication. The 2 patients
with pneumonitis continued to receive treatment and
completed the study (7 and 14 months after the date of
AE onset, respectively).
There was a low incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity, and very few patients experienced infusion reactions.

Figure 2. Mean trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), total trastuzumab, and DM1 concentration-time profile are shown for
patients (n ¼ 16) following the administration of all 3 doses
of T-DM1 2.4-mg/kg in cycle 1. Error bars indicate the standard deviation; the dotted line represents the minimum quantifiable concentration of 0.737 ng/mL for DM1.

No deaths were reported during the study or within 30
days after patients received their last dose of T-DM1. One
death due to progressive disease occurred after study discontinuation, 39 days after the last day of treatment. No
significant declines in left ventricular ejection fraction or
segmental wall motion abnormalities were reported.
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Analyses

Serum T-DM1, serum total trastuzumab, and plasma
DM1 concentrations are presented in Figure 2 with nominal time profiles after all 3 doses in cycle 1 for the 2.4-mg/
kg qw cohort. Table 3 shows the mean serum T-DM1
pharmacokinetic parameters for each cohort after the first
dose in cycle 1. Serum T-DM1 reached maximal concentration (Cmax) at the end of infusion; thereafter, concentrations decreased, with a mean terminal phase half-life
ranging between 2.3 and 3.4 days. Modest accumulation
was observed for T-DM1 following the 3 doses in cycle 1.
Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased proportionally with dose (Table 3). Mean clearance values were similar across the dose levels, and the volume of distribution
of T-DM1 approximated the physiologic serum volume.
Taken together, the pharmacokinetics of T-DM1 were
linear after the administration of the first dose at doses
ranging from 1.2 to 2.9 mg/kg.
Trastuzumab was detected in the pretreatment serum samples of 13 patients (46%). When compared
within the same dose group, the Cmax and AUC extrapolated to infinity values of total trastuzumab were higher
than those of T-DM1 (Table 4). In addition, the elimination half-life values were longer and the clearance values
were lower for total trastuzumab than for T-DM1 (see Table 4). The mean volume of distribution approximated
the physiologic serum volume and was generally independent of the T-DM1 dose administered. Total trastuzumab, like T-DM1, accumulated with qw dosing.
Plasma DM1 concentrations were consistently low,
and, by day 7, DM1 concentrations were below the limit
of detection in the majority of patients. Consistent with

than that of T-DM1.
Twenty-five patients (89%) had at least 1 postdose

Antitumor Activity

Confirmed partial tumor responses were reported in 13 of
the 28 patients enrolled (46%) (Figure 3). Of these, 6
occurred in the 2.4-mg/kg cohort (n ¼ 16), 2 in the 2.0mg/kg cohort (n ¼ 3), 2 in the 1.6-mg/kg cohort (n ¼ 3),
and 3 in the 1.2-mg/kg cohort (n ¼ 3). The DOR ranged
from 1.4þ to 19.1þ months (where þ represents a censored value). Four of the patients with objective responses
had a DOR >14 months. The DOR for the other patients
ranged from 1.4þ to 7.7 months. Stable disease >6
months was reported in 3 patients, and the 6-month clinical benefit rate was 57% (16 of 28 patients).
At baseline, 15 of the 16 patients in the 2.4-mg/kg
dose cohort had measurable disease. Of these, 6 patients

(40%) had an objective partial response, with a median

DISCUSSION
In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, qw administration
of T-DM1 at an MTD of 2.4 mg/kg was well tolerated
and clinically active in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had previously progressed while
receiving treatment with a trastuzumab-containing
regimen.
As with the T-DM1 q3w regimen, exposure to TDM1 qw was dose-proportional at doses of 1.2 mg/kg.
As expected from the half-life of T-DM1 and total trastuzumab, modest accumulation of both analytes was
observed with T-DM1 qw in cycle 1. However, the lack of
increased T-DM1 concentration during subsequent cycles
suggested that steady state was attained in cycle 1. TDM1 has a shorter elimination half-life compared with
total trastuzumab3,9; this is thought to be a reflection of
the differences in clearance mechanisms. T-DM1 is eliminated via both deconjugation of DM1 from intact antibody, as well as typical catabolic processes associated with
antibodies, whereas trastuzumab is subject only to the
latter.9
A comparison of T-DM1 q3w and qw exposures at
MTD during cycle 1 (AUC0-21d or AUClast,cycle 1) showed
that the cumulative exposure in cycle 1 with the T-DM1
qw MTD of 2.4 mg/kg was approximately twofold of that
observed with the T-DM1 q3w MTD of 3.6 mg/kg,
which is consistent with the relative cumulative doses
administered in cycle 1 (3.6 mg/kg in the q3w schedule vs
7.2 mg/kg in the qw schedule). Interestingly, this did not
appear to be associated with a significant increase in toxicity. The incidence of SAEs was low, and 4 (14%) patients
discontinued treatment as a result of AEs. The AEs experienced by patients receiving the T-DM1 qw regimen were
similar in nature, grade, and incidence to those experienced by patients receiving the T-DM1 q3w regimen.3
Grade 3 AEs were experienced by 19 of 28 (68%)
patients who received the T-DM1 qw regimen and by 12
of 24 (50%) patients who received the T-DM1 q3w regimen. The incidence of AEs typical of maytansinoids (eg,
sensory neuropathy, diarrhea, vomiting) was low, which is
consistent with the minimal systemic exposure to DM1.
This can be attributed to the unique, stable thioether
linker used to conjugate DM1 to trastuzumab.1
In general, the tolerability of T-DM1 qw also
appeared to be similar to that of T-DM1 q3w. For
patients receiving T-DM1 qw, the median dose intensity
(the total dose received divided by the total dose expected

to be administered) was 82.0% compared with 99.6% for
patients who received the T-DM1 q3w regimen, and the
median duration of treatment was 18.9 vs 16.7 weeks,
respectively.
Thrombocytopenia was a DLT for both regimens.
While the mechanism of action is currently unknown,
population pharmacokinetic modeling and in vitro studies suggest that altered platelet production by megakaryocytes, rather than an effect on circulating platelets, likely
accounts for the observed thrombocytopenia.10,11 In
addition to thrombocytopenia, mild-to-moderate
increases in hepatic aminotransferases were reported on
both schedules, which is consistent with findings from
studies of T-DM1 in cynomolgus monkeys (Genentech,
data on file).
The qw and q3w schedules of T-DM1 both demonstrated substantial activity in patients with previously
treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with clinical benefit rates of 57% and 50%, respectively. While
further conclusions about the relative efficacy of these
schedules cannot be drawn because of the small sample
sizes involved, the T-DM1 qw dosing schedule is being
evaluated further in ongoing clinical studies, including a
phase 1b dose-escalation trial of a combination therapy
(T-DM1, paclitaxel, and pertuzumab) in patients with
HER2-positive, locally advanced, or metastatic breast
cancer.12
