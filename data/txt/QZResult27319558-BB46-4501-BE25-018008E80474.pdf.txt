ABSTRACT
Cancer cells exhibit characteristic changes in their metabolism with efforts being
made to address them therapeutically. However, targeting metabolic enzymes as such
is a major challenge due to their essentiality for normal proliferating cells. The most
successful pharmaceutical targets are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), with
more than 40% of all currently available drugs acting through them.
We show that, a family of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, the Hydroxycarboxylic acid
receptor family (HCAs), is crucial for breast cancer cells to control their metabolism
and proliferation.
We found HCA1 and HCA3 mRNA expression were significantly increased in breast
cancer patient samples and detectable in primary human breast cancer patient cells.
Furthermore, siRNA mediated knock-down of HCA3 induced considerable breast
cancer cell death as did knock-down of HCA1, although to a lesser extent. Liquid
Chromatography Mass Spectrometry based analyses of breast cancer cell medium
revealed a role for HCA3 in controlling intracellular lipid/fatty acid metabolism. The
presence of etomoxir or perhexiline, both inhibitors of fatty acid β‑oxidation rescues
breast cancer cells with knocked-down HCA3 from cell death.
Our data encourages the development of drugs acting on cancer-specific
metabolite-sensing GPCRs as novel anti-proliferative agents for cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

toxicity of drugs acting upon those enzymes [3-5].
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute
the largest family of transmembrane receptors, transduce
diverse extracellular signals inside the cell and represent
one of the major pharmaceutical targets [6, 7]. Recently,
a growing number of so far orphan GPCRs, have been
shown to be activated by metabolic intermediates or
energy substrates [8]. The HCA family of receptors
consists of three members that are mainly expressed in
adipocytes [9, 10]. Activation by their respective agonists
inhibits adipocyte lipolysis [9, 10]. HCA1 is activated by
lactate, a product of glycolysis, the endogenous agonist
for HCA2 is 3‑hydroxybutyrate (3HB), a ketone body and
for HCA3, 3‑hydroxyoctanoate (3HO), an intermediate of

Ever since Warburg’s discovery of aerobic glycolysis
as a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells, extensive
studies have increased our understanding of cancer cell
metabolism [1, 2]. Characteristic metabolic changes,
besides aerobic glycolysis have been identified including,
increased lactate production, glutamine metabolism, and
fatty acid synthesis, coupled with decreased fatty acid
oxidation [1, 2]. Cancer-specific up-regulated enzymes
involved in central metabolic pathways have been
identified, and have come into focus as targets for cancer
therapy [3-5]. However, because all cells depend on the
same central metabolic pathways, one main obstacle is the

Since HCAs are activated by intermediates of
central metabolic processes that are often differentially
regulated in cancer cells (e.g. glycolysis), we set out to
investigate their potential role for cancer cell proliferation.
Here, we demonstrate that HCA1 and HCA3
mRNA expression is increased in human breast cancer
patient tissue as compared to normal tissue samples,
and in primary breast cancer cells. We provide evidence,
that HCA3 and to a lesser extent HCA1, are essential
for breast cancer cells to control their lipid/fatty acid
metabolism. Cancer cell metabolism is perturbed when
cellular transmembrane “metabolic surveillance”, through
namely HCA1 and HCA3, is abrogated causing a decrease
in viability and/or cell death. Thus, HCA1 and HCA3
constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention in
cancer.

mRNA expression levels of HCA1, HCA2 and HCA3
in eight different cancers versus the respective normal
tissues. For this purpose we used the Cancer and Normal
TissueScanTM Cancer Survey cDNA qPCR Array – I
(CSRT501) (Origene) which contains tissue cDNAs
that are synthesized from high quality total RNAs of
pathologist-verified tissues, normalized and validated with
β-actin in two sequential qPCR analyses, and are provided
with clinical information and QC data. HCA2 and HCA3
mRNA expression was significantly higher in colon cancer
and HCA2 was lower in kidney, slightly lower in lung and
slightly increased in ovarian cancer samples (Figure S1).
However, the strongest differential mRNA expression of
HCA1 (Figure 2A), HCA2 (Figure 2B) and HCA3 (Figure
2C) was detected in breast cancer patient versus normal
tissue samples, with HCA1 showing about 5-fold, HCA2
about 2-fold and HCA3 about 3-fold higher mRNA
expression levels (Figure 2A-C).

RESULTS

HCA1 and HCA3 transcripts are expressed in
primary breast cancer cells

Breast cancer patient tissue exhibits higher HCA
mRNA expression levels when compared to
normal breast tissue

Following these results, we obtained primary
breast cancer cells from three different patients and
analyzed HCA mRNA expression. We found HCA1
mRNA expression more than 100-fold (Figure 2D), HCA2
mRNA expression unchanged (Figure 2E) and HCA3
mRNA expression about 50-fold higher (Figure 2F) in

Since a relevance of HCAs for cancer cell
metabolism can only be assumed if they are expressed
in human cancer patient tissue, we first analyzed the

indicator for increased rates of glycolysis. Excess acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies, one of which is 3HB - the endogenous agonist

in the lung cancer cell lines A549 and DMS53 as well
as in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM

significantly higher in the acute promyelocytic leukemia

expression in DMS53 cells was lower when compared to
HCA2 mRNA expression in MCF12A cells (Figure 2K).

the viability of breast cancer cell lines but not of
MCF12A and HEK293T

was detectable in normal colon, kidney and liver tissue
samples. HCA2 mRNA expression could be shown for all
normal tissue samples with highest level of expression in
kidney and liver (Figure S2B). Transcripts of HCA3 were
also detectable in all normal tissue samples with highest
expression in kidney, liver and lung (Figure S2C).

To assess whether the HCAs are essential for breast
cancer cell line proliferation we performed siRNAmediated knock-down experiments. Microscopy images
of crystal violet-stained cells revealed that knock-down
of HCA1 slightly and of HCA3 considerably, decreased
viability in both BT-474 and HCC1954 whereas no effect
was observed for MCF12A and HEK293T cells (Figure
4A). These qualitative results were further confirmed by
quantification of cell viability through measurement of the
relative ATP level. The knock-down efficiency as well as
the co-regulation of related HCA mRNA expression, was
monitored using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR).
For all experiments, we used pooled siRNA
containing one third of each A, B and C siRNA provided
from OriGene (Table S2). However, we also measured
the viability of BT-474 and HCC1954 cells upon the
transfection of each individual siRNA. Thereby, we were
able to detect a significant decrease in viability of both cell
lines 72h after transfection with siHCA1-A and siHCA1-C,
or with siHCA3-B and siHCA3-C (Figure S3).
An 80% knock-down of HCA1 (Figure S4A) caused
a 20% and 40% decrease in HCC1954 viability after
48h and 72h, respectively, whereas it had no significant
influence on BT‑474 viability (Figure 4B). HCA1 knockdown was accompanied by an increased mRNA expression
of HCA2 and HCA3 (Figure S4A). 48h after siHCA1
transfection HCC38 viability was already about 60%
reduced. But, 72h after transfection with siHCA1 no effect
on viability was observed for cells that do not express
HCA1, specifically MCF12A and HEK293T (Figure 4B).
In contrast, the viability of BT-474 cells exhibiting
a 60-70% knock-down of HCA2 (Figure S4B) was
significantly increased, had no effect on HCC1954,
MCF12A and HEK293T viability and induced a significant
reduction in viability in HCC38 cells (Figure 4C).
The cell viability of the BT-474 cells was 40%,
80% and 90% reduced 24h, 48h and 72h after siHCA3
transfection, and for the HCC1954 cells, 50% and 80%
after 48h and 72h, respectively (Figure 4D). The viability
of the siHCA3 transfected HCC38 cells was already after
24h 60% lower when compared to siNC transfected
HCC38 cells and only 10-20% of cells were still alive
after 48h and 72h (Figure 4D).
The HCA3 knock-down could not reliably be
determined when experiments were carried out in
presence of 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) which was
used to ensure high transfection efficiency (Figure S4C).
The knock-down of HCA3 in breast cancer cells causes
induction of apoptosis in those cells (Figure 5C) which
in turn leads to changes in reference gene expression,

HCA mRNA expression levels relative to HCA1 in
cancer cell lines
Moreover, we analyzed our RT-qPCR data obtained
from all 9 cell lines regarding the expression of HCA2
and HCA3 relative to HCA1 to provide information about
the relative abundance of HCA transcripts in comparison
to each other. In MCF12A, (Figure S2D), HCC1954
(Figure S2F), HL60 (Figure S2I) and LNCaP cells HCA2
and HCA3 transcripts are more abundant than HCA1
transcripts. The opposite is true for BT-474 (Figure S2E)
and DMS53 (Figure S2J) cells and no difference in HCA
transcript abundance is found in HCC38 (Figure S2G),
CEM (Figure S2H) and A549 (Figure S2K) cells.

HCA agonist stimulation induces a decrease in
intracellular cAMP levels in BT-474
All members of the HCA receptor family are Gαicoupled receptors [10]. Thus, agonist-mediated receptor
activation induces inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and
the intracellular cAMP level is subsequently reduced.
We performed cAMP assays in the presence of 10 µM
forskolin and increasing concentrations of lactate, 3HB or
3HO in BT-474 (Figure 3A-B). Thereby we were able to
determine an EC50 of 3.4 mM for lactate, 0.46 mM for
3HB and 9.5 µM for 3HO (Figure 1D-F). Lactate has
been reported to activate human HCA1 with an EC50 in
the range of 1.3 - 5 mM [12-14]. The EC50 value of 3HB
activating HCA2 has been reported as 0.7 mM [15] and
of 3HO activating HCA3 as 8 µM [16]. Accordingly, our
data strongly suggests the presence of functional HCA1,
HCA2 and HCA3 receptor protein in BT-474 cells. To
exclude that the inhibitory effects on cAMP levels exerted
by lactate, 3HB and 3HO are unspecific effects of high
metabolite concentrations, we tested their sensitivity to
pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin is an inhibitor of the Gαi
protein and blocked both endogenous (lactate, 3HB and
3HO) and synthetic HCA agonist-induced decrease in
intracellular cAMP levels in BT-474 cells (Figure 3DF). 3,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid is a specific HCA1 agonist
[17], HCA2 is known to be activated by the antipsoriatic
drug monomethyl fumarate [18] and IPBT-5CA (IBC-293,
1-(1-methylethyl)-1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid) is
a selective HCA3 agonist [19, 20].

Transiently HCA1 and HCA3 overexpressing
BT-474 and HCC1954 show increased viability
when compared to mock-transfected cells

thus preventing the reliable determination of ∆∆Cq.
However, with serial reduction of HCA3 specific siRNA
and performing the experiments in the presence of 10%
FBS, transfection efficiency was decreased and viability
less effected (Figure S5A-D) thereby allowing detection of
30-40% and 20-70% siHCA3-mediated decrease in HCA3
mRNA levels in BT‑474 and HCC1954, respectively
(Figure S5E-F). Further, we assessed HCA cell surface
expression in transiently HCA overexpressing HEK293T
cells co-transfected with either respective HCA-specific
siRNA or siNC using an indirect cellular ELISA (Figure
S6A-C). 24h after co-transfection with HA-tagged
HCA-encoding plasmid and siRNA we could detect
an approximate 50% decrease in HA-tagged HCA1 cell
surface expression (Figure S6A), 40% less HA-tagged
HCA2 receptor on the cell surface (Figure S6B) and
approximately 60% reduction of the HA-tagged HCA3 cell
surface expression in HEK293T cells (Figure S6C).

We next tested the influence of transient
overexpression of HCA1, HCA2 and HCA3 on the BT-474
and HCC1954 cell viability. Transiently transfected,
HCA1-overexpressing BT-474 and to lesser extent
HCC1954 exhibited an increased cell viability when
compared to cells transfected with empty vector (Figure
S6D). The cell viability of HCA2 overexpressing
HCC1954 was reduced after 72h whereas no effect was
observed in BT-474 cells (Figure S6E). An increased
viability in transiently HCA3 overexpressing BT-474 and
HCC1954 cells was observed (Figure S6F).

metabolite concentration produced per metabolically
active cell (Figure 6A). Similarly, because of their lower
detection in the medium alone, we proceeded with the C10-,
C12- and C14-carnitines after subtraction of the relative
quantity of these carnitines detected in medium alone
from the raw data counts (Figure 6A). This data revealed
a highly increased, siHCA3 concentration-dependent
production/release of FAO intermediates and carnitines
per viable cell (Figure 6A).

Subsequently, we analyzed whether the observed
siHCA1- and siHCA3-induced loss in breast cancer
viability was due to apoptosis. Therefore, we measured
caspase 3/7 activity 24h and 48h after siHCA1 or siHCA3
transfection in all three breast cancer cell lines. Increased
caspase 3/7 activity was detectable in siHCA1 transfected
HCC1954 cells after 48h and in HCC38 cells after 24h
and 48h (Fig 5A). In the presence of 30 µM of the cellpermeable pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK the signal
was completely diminished (Figure 5B). The HCA3 knockdown induced apoptosis in all three breast cancer cell
lines, where in the BT-474 and HCC38 cells the obtained
caspase 3/7 activity was highest 24h, but in HCC1954
48h after siHCA3 transfection (Figure 5C). Caspase 3/7
activity could not be detected in siHCA3 transfected breast
cancer cells when Z-VAD-FMK was present (Figure 5D).

inhibitors of FAO, protect BT-474 and HCC1954

To further analyze the role of FAO in relation to
HCA3, we tested whether inhibitors of FAO could rescue
the siHCA3-induced loss of viability in BT-474 and
HCC1954. In the presence of etomoxir or perhexiline,
both O-carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) inhibitors,
no siHCA3-induced loss of viability could be observed in
BT-474 and HCC1954 cells 24h and 48h after transfection,
respectively (Figure 6B, 6C).

DISCUSSION

HCA3 knock-down causes a dysregulation of the
lipid/fatty acid metabolism

Cancer cell metabolism has gained increasingly
attention as being a target for therapeutic intervention,
with numerous studies contributing to our understanding
of metabolic changes in tumor cells [1-5]. Enzymes
involved in central metabolic pathways that are
specifically up-regulated in cancer, have come into focus
as targets for the development of chemotherapeutic drugs
[3-5]. The main difficulty encountered is the fact that
most of the central metabolic enzymes are also essential
for normal proliferating cells. Consequently, drugs acting
upon metabolic enzymes are likely to exhibit unwanted
side-effects in normal tissue. In the present study, we
show that cancer metabolism can be targeted through the
metabolite-sensing HCAs. HCAs belong to the GPCR
family, which constitutes a major pharmaceutical target
with more than 40% of all currently available drugs acting
through them [6, 7]. One advantage of targeting cancer
metabolism through the transmembrane-spanning GPCRs
is that drug-delivery through the membrane to the interior
of a cell becomes unnecessary.
In our study, we demonstrate that HCAs are
expressed in breast cancer patient tissue, primary breast
cancer patient cells and three different breast cancer cell
lines (Figure 2). Very recently, HCA1 expression has
been demonstrated in several cancer cell types, including
colon, lung and breast [21] which is in line with the HCA1
expression we observe (Figure 2, S1). Here, we show
that HCA1 is necessary for survival of the HER2-positive
breast cancer cell line HCC1954 and the triple-negative
HCC38 cells (Figure 4B). Loss of HCA1 in those breast

We hypothesize that HCA3 is important for
controlling the balance of lipid/fatty acid metabolism in
breast cancer cells. To test our hypothesis, we used LiquidChromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC‑MS) to analyze
compounds related to lipid/fatty acid metabolism in the
medium of siHCA3 versus siNC transfected BT-474 cells
(Table S3).
The compound quantity measured as the
chromatographic peak height, which is proportional to the
metabolite concentration (Table S3), and the cell viability,
were determined (Figure S6C). BT-474 cells with only
a 30% reduced HCA3 mRNA level (Figure S6E) and
approximately a 25% decreased viability (Figure S6C),
take up significantly more lysophosphatidylcholines,
reflecting a higher metabolic demand for lipids (Table
S3). Moreover, higher levels of C10-, C12- and C14-carnitine
were detected in the medium of siHCA3 transfected
BT-474 cells whereas the short-chain carnitines were
unaffected (Figure 6A, Table S3). Furthermore, FAO
intermediates such as 3HO, 3-hydroxydecanoate and
3‑hydroxydodecanoate as well as 3‑oxodocanoate and
3-oxotetradecanoate are liberated to a higher extent
from BT-474 with knocked-down HCA3 (Table S3).
These metabolites were not detectable in the medium
alone, thus leading us to the assumption that they are
exclusively produced by metabolically active, viable
cells. We normalized the obtained metabolite data for
these compounds (Table S3) to the cell viability data
determined in parallel (Figure S6C), resulting in a

cancer cells leads to a loss in viability through apoptosis
(Figure 5A). In mice, HCA1 mediates anti-lipolytic effects
in an insulin dependent manner [13] and regulation of
the lipogenic/lipolytic balance is essential for HER2
overexpressing cancer cells to ensure rapid proliferation

[5]. Due to a high rate of glycolysis, cancer cells produce
high levels of lactate which is exported out of the cell
(Figure 1). There, sufficiently high lactate concentrations
activate HCA1 which subsequently causes inhibition
of lipolysis and FAO and as recently shown an increase

in mRNA expression levels of genes critical for lactate
transport and metabolism [21]. We show, that knockdown of HCA1 is accompanied by an increased mRNA
expression of HCA2 and HCA3 (Figure S4A) implying a
role for the related HCA family members as secondary
metabolic surveillance to monitor cellular metabolic shifts.
We suggest that inhibition of FAO/lipolysis through lactate
activated HCA1 most likely facilitates a higher rate of fatty
acid synthesis and lipogenesis, thereby enabling a higher
rate of proliferation.
In contrast, the question arises of why HCA2 knockdown causes an increase in proliferation of breast cancer
cells and HCA2 activation suppresses tumor growth as
recently shown for colon and mammary tumors [11, 2224]? Assuming a scenario in which cancer cells shunt
glucose to anabolic processes rather than oxidizing
it for ATP production, the energy demand has to be
satisfied through other pathways such as FAO [2]. By
increased lipolysis and subsequent FAO, acetyl-CoA
is generated which can enter the citric acid cycle [2]. If
the level of acetyl CoA exceeds the capacity of the citric
acid cycle, ketone bodies such as 3HB are produced
and exported out of the cell where HCA2 is activated
and subsequently lipolysis is inhibited (Figure 1). By
abrogation of this negative feedback mechanism and in
the presence of glucose, cancer cells can maintain a high
rate of proliferation that is accompanied by ketone body
production, which in turn can again be re-utilized as an
energy source [25, 26].
Knock-down of HCA3 induced cell death in all three
breast cancer cell lines BT-474, HCC1954 and HCC38,
accompanied by a remarkable decrease in cell viability
(Figure 4D, 5C). HCA3 is a Gαi-coupled receptor that is
activated by 3HO [16]. Micromolar levels of 3HO can
be detected in patients with FAO disorders, including
long-chain, medium-chain and short-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase defects [27, 28] as well as in patients with
acute diabetic ketoacidosis and in patients that receive a
ketogenic diet [16]. Previous studies indicate that elevated
levels of medium chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids, including
3HO are indicators of and correlate with increased rates
of FAO under physiological and pathophysiological
conditions [16, 27-30]. Ahmed et al. suggest that HCA3
is a sensor for elevated 3HO levels which itself is an
indicator of high β-oxidation rates. Activation of HCA3
by 3HO would inhibit free fatty acid release and thereby
lower their availability for FAO and thus constitutes
another negative feedback mechanism to control lipolytic
activity [10, 16].
Our data suggests that this negative feedback
mechanism mediated by HCA3 is crucial for BT-474,
HCC1954 and HCC38 cell proliferation and survival. We
hypothesize that HCA3 has a central role in controlling
the balance of lipid/fatty acid metabolism in breast cancer
cells. This hypothesis is further supported by our finding
of increased levels of C10- C12- and C14-carnitine levels as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

well as FAO intermediates 3HO, 3-hydroxydecanoate,
3-hydroxydodecanoate,
3-oxodocanoate
and
3-oxotetradecanoate in the medium of siHCA3 transfected
BT-474 (Figure 6A, Table S3). Recent evidence shows that
C10-carnitine originates from peroxisomal FAO, potentially
a compensatory mechanism to metabolize medium- and
long-chain fatty acids in cases of mitochondrial FAO
overload [31]. Moreover, the extracellular increase
of 3-hydroxy- and 3-oxo-FAO intermediates reflects
a higher intracellular rate of FAO and especially the
extracellular increase of 3HO upon HCA3 knock-down
strongly supports a role for HCA3 in a negative feedback
mechanism controlling the FAO rate in BT-474 cells.
Further, we show that BT-474 and HCC1954 cell survival
with knocked-down HCA3 is rescued in the presence of
FAO inhibitors (Figure 6B, 6C) providing further evidence
for a critical role of HCA3 in controlling the FAO rates in
breast cancer cells. In summary, the obtained metabolite
data points towards an uncontrolled up-regulated FAO
in cells with knocked-down HCA3 as the cause for the
induced cell death (Figure 4D, 5C, 6A).
We provide evidence that HCAs are important
for breast cancer cells to balance their lipid/fatty acid
metabolism. Further, we show that cancer cell metabolism
can be targeted through GPCRs, thus bypassing direct
targeting of intracellular metabolic enzymes. Agonists
and antagonists acting at cancer-specific overexpressed
metabolite-sensing GPCRs therefore have potential as
anti-cancer drugs by perturbing the control of cancer cell
metabolism.

recommendations from ATCC.

Primary breast cancer cells
Primary breast cancer cells originating from three
different patients were obtained from Celther Polska
Ltd. Cells were cultured in human EpiCult™-C Human
19715

Oncotarget

Medium (StemCell technologies) supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum and 0.48 μg/mL hydrocortisone
following the recommendations from Celther. The primary
human breast cancer cells CLTH/BC-7 were obtained from
a 49 year old human invasive ductual breast carcinoma
patient. The primary human breast cancer cells CLTH/BC8
originate from 47 year old individual with invasive ductual
breast carcinoma and CLTH/BC9 are taken from a 49 year
old patient with invasive breast carcinoma (ER (-); PR (-);
HER (+)) All primary cells are positive for MGB-1 which
is specific for breast cells, they express an isoform 7 of
MUC-1 which is specific for tumor cells.

15 min the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding
1 M H2SO4 containing 0.05 M Na2SO4, and colour
development was measured bichromatically at 492 and
620 nm using an ELISA reader (TECAN Sunrise plate
reader).

siRNA and plasmid transfection
HCAR1 (ID 27198), HCAR2 (ID 338442), HCAR3
(ID 8843) and Universal scrambled negative control
trilencer-27 human siRNA were purchased from OriGene
(Table S2). One day prior transfection, 15.000 c/w
BT-474, 7.500 c/w HCC1954 and 15.000 c/w HCC38
were seeded in 96w plates in RPMI1640 (HyClone)
containing 10% FBS (Sigma Aldrich), 4.5 g/l glucose, 2
mM glutamine, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
(Life Technologies). Just before transfection medium
was changed to RPMI1640 containing 2.5% FBS, 2 g/l
glucose and 2 mM glutamine. 24h before transfection
15.000 c/w MCF12A were seeded in 96w plate in a 1:1
mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
and Ham’s F12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 5% horse serum (Sigma Aldrich), 20 ng/ml human
epidermal growth factor (Sigma Aldrich), 100 ng/ml
cholera toxin (Sigma Aldrich), 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin
(Sigma Aldrich) and 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma
Aldrich). Prior transfection medium was replaced with
fresh medium. 5.000 c/w HEK293T cells were seeded
in a 96w plate in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% FBS and 24h later, before siRNA transfection
medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 2.5%
FBS.
Subsequently, cells were transfected using SAINTRED (Synvolux Therapeutics) or SAINT-MIX (Synvolux
Therapeutics) for siRNA or plasmid transfection following
manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. BT‑474,
MCF12A and HEK293T cells were transfected with a
final concentration of 60 nM or 80 ng plasmid per well,
using 1.2 µl SAINT-RED or SAINT-MIX, respectively.
HCC1954 cells were transfected with a final concentration
of 40 nM siRNA or 40 ng plasmid per well, using 0.8 µl
SAINT-RED or SAINT-MIX, respectively.

cAMP assay
Two days prior determination of agonist-mediated
inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production, 20.000
c/w BT-474 were seeded in 96w plates in RPMI1640
containing 10% FBS, 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mM glutamine,
5 mM HEPES and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. One day
after seeding, medium was replaced with serum free
RPMI1640 with or without 100 ng/µL pertussis toxin
and incubated for another 24h, before stimulation with
various agonist concentrations (carried out in triplicates)
was performed in presence of 10 µM forskolin and 1 mM
3‑isobutyl‑1‑methylxanthine (IBMX). Reactions were
stopped by aspiration of media on ice and cells lysis
with 20 µl of lysis buffer containing 1 mM IBMX. The
cAMP content of cell extracts was determined using the
AlphaScreen® cAMP Assay Kit (Perkin Elmer) according
to the manufacturers’ protocol. From each 96w 5 µl of
lysate were transferred to a 384w plate. Acceptor beads
(in stimulation buffer without IBMX) and donor beads
were added according to the instructions given by the
manufacturer.

ELISA
An indirect cellular ELISA was used to estimate
cell surface expression of N-terminal HA-tagged receptor
constructs. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded into polyL-lysine coated 48-well plates (8x104 cells per well) and
transfected the following day with 0.2 µg DNA, 80 nM
siRNA and 0.5 µl LipofectamineTM 2000 per well
according to the manufacturers’ protocol. 24h hours after
transfection cells were fixed with formaldehyde, without
disrupting the cell membrane and incubated in blocking
solution (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells
were then incubated with anti-HA-peroxidase-labelled
high affinity rat monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). After
removal of excess unbound antibody by extensive
washing, H2O2 and ο-phenylenediamine (2.5 mM each
in 0.1 M phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0) were added
to serve as substrate and chromogen, respectively. After

Generation of human HCA1, HCA2 and HCA3
constructs
Primer pairs (Table S4) were used to amplify human
HCAR1 (NM_032554.3), human HCAR2 (NM_177551.3)
and human HCAR3 (NM_006018.2) from genomic DNA.
Genomic DNA samples were prepared from HCC1954
cells using DNeasy®Blood&Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The
PCR reaction (50 µl) contained genomic DNA (100 ng)
with primers (400 nM each), ThermoPol reaction buffer
(1x), dNTP (125 µM, each) and Taq- and Pfu-polymerase
(0.5 U each, NEB). The reactions were initiated with a
19716

Oncotarget

denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s
and elongation at 72°C for 1 min. A final extension step
was performed at 72°C for 10 min. Specific PCR products
were directly sub-cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector
(Invitrogen) for sequencing. Sequencing reactions were
performed with a dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit and
applied on an ABI 3700 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
The full length human HCAR1, human HCAR2
and human HCAR3 with an N-terminal hemagglutinin
(HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) and a C-terminal FLAGtag (DYKDDDDK) were inserted into the mammalian
expression vector pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen).

FBS, 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 5 mM HEPES and
1 mM sodium pyruvate with medium change before and
24h after transfection (corresponding qPCR data in Figure
S5E-F), and cells of four wells were harvested 48h after
transfection. Total RNA isolation was performed using
RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturers’
instructions. RNA concentration was determined with
a NanoDrop® ND-1000 in TE (pH 8), OD A260/A280
ratios were 1.9-2.0. Prior reverse transcription, 1 µg
RNA (determination of basal HCA expression in cell
lines and primary breast cancer cells) or 100-300 ng
(determination of knock-down efficiency) were treated
with 1 µl DnaseI (NEB) in a total reaction volume
of 10 µl for 10 min at 37°C. Reaction was stopped by
addition of 1 µl 50 mM EDTA and heat inactivation for
10 min at 75°C. Directly thereafter, RNA was reverse
transcribed using iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. TissueScanTM
Cancer Survey cDNA qPCR Array – I (CSRT501)
from OriGene Technologies is a panel of normalized
cDNA from multiple cancer tissues. A report, including
information about disease state for each sample as well
as an electropherogramm indicating RNA quality and
bioanalyzer ratio is provided (CSRT101 - http://www.
origene.com/qPCR/Tissue-qPCR-Arrays.aspx). OriGene
received high quality total RNA from Cytomyx and
generated first-strand cDNA using an oligo-dT primer. The
average amount of cDNA is 2-3 ng per well but can vary
due to normalization based on β-actin.
The qPCR setup was as follows: each reaction (20 µl)
contained cDNA (10-20 ng for determination of basal
expression levels of HCA in cell lines and primary breast
cancer cells; 2-5 ng for determination of knock-down
efficiency after siRNA transfection), primers (500 nM
each in final reaction) and 10 µl iTaq™ Universal SYBR®
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The following thermal
cycling protocol was used: polymerase activation at 95°C
for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s of denaturation
at 95°C and 30 s of monitored annealing/extension at
60°C. Subsequently, melt curves were recorded (55°C 94.5°C, 0.5 °C increment, 10 s/step). Real-time PCR and
data collection (analysis mode: PCR baseline subtracted,
baseline was manually set to 500 for cancer panel data and
300 for all other data) were performed on Bio-Rad®iQ™5
Real-Time PCR Detection System.
If not specified differently, primers (stated in Table
S5) were designed using Primer-Blast (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) [33], product size: 80200 bp, Tm 59°C - 61°C, max Tm difference 1°C and
high primer specificity stringency settings. Primers with
highest specificity and lowest values for 3’- and selfcomplementarity were chosen and ordered from Life
Technologies. With each primer pair specified in Table
S5 and Table S6, melt curves after the qPCR run showed
as one single sharp peak. Agarose gel analyses revealed
only one band of correct size. Primer efficiency (stated

Cell viability, apoptosis
ATPlite™ (PerkinElmer) was used to determine cell
viability according to manufacturers’ instructions. 30 µM
etomoxir or 2.5 µM perhexiline were added 6h after
transfection and viability was measured 24h (BT474) or 48h (HCC1954) after transfection (Figure
6B, 6C). Crystal violet staining was used to observe
cell viability with microscopy (Figure 4A). 48h after
siRNA transfection medium was completely removed
from all wells and cells were incubated 10 min with a
1% crystal violet solution in 3.6% paraformaldehyde,
1% MeOH and 20% EtOH. Subsequently, cells were
washed three times with water and microscoped.
Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay (Promega) was used to
measure apoptosis. Z-VAD-FMK (Promega) was added
to a final concentration of 30 µM 30 min before siRNA
transfection and apoptosis was measured 24h (BT-474,
HCC38) or 48h (HCC1954) after transfection.

quantitative real-time PCR
Here, we provide a detailed protocol description
according to the MIQE guidelines [32] regarding each
experimental step as well as choice of reference genes,
data analyses and primers used.
To determine basal expression of HCA1, HCA2
and HCA3, BT-474 (500.000 c), HCC1954 (150.000
c), HCC38 (500.000 c), MCF12A (500.000 c), A549
(500.000 c), DMS53 (1.000.000 c), CEM (1.000.000 c)
HL60 (1.000.000 c), LNCaP (1.000.000 c) and primary
breast cancer (2.000.000 c) cells were seeded in a 6w
plate and cultured for 48h in their respective medium (as
recommended from ATCC) before harvested for RNA
preparation. To determine siRNA knock-down efficiency
BT-474 and HCC1954 cells were siRNA transfected in
96w plates as stated before in RPMI1640 containing 2.5%
FBS, 2 g/l glucose and 2 mM glutamine (corresponding
qPCR data in Figure S4) or RPMI1640 containing 10%

pooled cDNA (~20 ng). Data was analyzed using linear
regression analysis implemented in GraphPad Prism
version 6.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software). Raw Cq
values collected from the thermocycler were imported and
analyzed using the Gene Expression Analysis for iCycler
iQ® Real-time PCR Detection System version 1.10 (2004)
Excel Spreadsheet that was downloaded from http://www.
bio-rad.com/ and is derived from algorithms outlined
by Vandesompele et al. [34]. Primer efficiency was set
100%, thus using the ∆ΔCq method to analyze the data.
TissueScanTM Cancer Survey cDNA qPCR Array data was
normalized to endogenous control/reference gene β-actin
(n = 2) as recommended from OriGene after consultation
of product support, using the primers provided (stated
in Table S5). qPCR for each HCA was run in duplicate
using commercially available primer (SABiosciences,
information provided stated in Table S6) for one replicate
and self-designed primer pairs for the second replicate
(primer No. 1-6 stated in Table S5). Basal expression
of HCA1, HCA2 and HCA3 was normalized to reference
gene RPS18. In total, 5 reference genes (RPS18, ACTB,
GAPDH, RPL13A, RPLO) were tested and Normfinder
[35] was used to identify the most stably expressed gene
(stability values: RPS18: 0.104, ACTB: 0.375, GAPDH:
0.174, RPL13A: 0.312, RPLO: 0.174). All qPCR data
from knock-down experiments was normalized to RPS18
and ACTB. 5 reference genes were tested for knockdown in HCC1954 and again Normfinder [35] was used
to determine stability values (RPS18: 0.050, RPL13A:
0.050, ACTB: 0.060, HSC70: 0.377, H2ai: 0.480). For all
experiments indicated n reflect biological replicates, that
were reverse-transcribed and qPCR was run in duplicates.

All solvents were of HPLC grade. Linear gradients were
devised as follows for reversed phase separation (0.5 mL/
minute) minute 0: 5%B, minute 8: 95%B, minute 10:
95%B, minute 10.2: 5%B, minute 12: 5%B. Data was
analyzed using Mass Hunter Qual (Agilent) using the
“find by formula” function with a match tolerance for
masses of 10 ppm and for retention times of 0.35 min. The
list of all compounds analyzed, including sum formulas,
monoisotopic masses and normalized fold changes can
be found in Table S3. Most of the metabolites were
identified using synthetic standards obtained from Sigma
Aldrich, Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cayman Chemical
comparing accurate mass, retention time and in some
cases MS/MS spectra.
