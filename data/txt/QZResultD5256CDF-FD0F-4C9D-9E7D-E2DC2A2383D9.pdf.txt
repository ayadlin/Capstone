ABSTRACT:
Prostate cancer (PCa) is of increasing significance worldwide as a consequence
of the population ageing. Fragile elderly patients may particularly benefit from
noninvasive and well tolerable immunotherapeutic approaches. Preclinical studies
have revealed that the immune-regulatory cytokine IL-27 may exert anti-tumor
activities in a variety of tumor types without discernable toxicity. We, thus,
investigated whether IL-27 may function as anti-tumor agent in human (h) PCa and
analyzed the rationale for its clinical application.
In vitro, IL-27 treatment significantly inhibited proliferation and reduced
the angiogenic potential of hPCa cells by down-regulating the pro-angiogenesisrelated genes fms-related tyrosine kinase (FLT)1, prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/
cyclooxygenase-1 (PTGS1/COX-1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)3.
In addition, IL-27 up-regulated the anti-angiogenesis-related genes such as CXCL10
and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3). In vivo, IL-27 reduced proliferation
and vascularization in association with ischemic necrosis of tumors developed after
PC3 or DU145 cell injection in athymic nude mice. In patients’ prostate tissues, IL27R was expressed by normal epithelia and low grade PCa and lost by high tumor
grade and stages. Nevertheless, IL-27R was expressed by CD11c+, CD4+ and CD8+
leukocytes infiltrating the tumor and draining lymph nodes.
These data lead to the conclusion that i) IL-27’s anti-PCa potential may be fully
exploited in patients with well-differentiated, localized IL-27R positive PCa, since in
this case it may act on both cancerous epithelia and the tumor microenvironment;
ii) PCa patients bearing high grade and stage tumor that lack IL-27R may benefit,
however, from IL-27’s immune-stimulatory properties.

INTRODUCTION

The recently identified heterodimeric member of the
IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines [1,2] namely interleukin
(IL)-27, has revealed potent anti-tumor effects in various
tumor models and, importantly, freedom from toxicity in
preclinical trials [3]. IL-27 displays anti-tumor activity
via different mechanisms [3]. It has been reported to
exert anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects by
directly acting on cancer cells in melanoma [4,5], B acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [6], acute myeloid leukemia [7],

Since the incidence of prostate cancer (PCa)
increases with age, the number of new cases diagnosed
in the Western countries will rise in the foreseeable future
as the inevitable consequence of the universal aging of
their populations. Less aggressive and more tolerable
therapeutic approaches than radical management may thus
be preferable particularly for elderly patients.

B cell lymphoma [8] and multiple myeloma [9]. It also
exerts indirect anti-tumor effects driven by its immunestimulatory activity in melanoma [10], colon carcinoma
[11,12], neuroblastoma [13], lung cancer [14], and head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma [15]. Studies on IL27’s effects in PCa have so far been carried out both in
vitro with murine prostate cancer cell lines [16] and in
vivo with immune-competent murine PCa models [17].
These findings open the perspective to candidate IL27 as therapeutic agent in PCa patients. We therefore
investigated this issue using in vitro and in vivo models,
and analyzing the expression of IL-27 receptor (R) in
prostate tissues and draining lymph nodes from PCa
patients with different tumor grades and stages.

Since IL-27 revealed anti-tumor effects in a variety
of tumor models, we assessed whether IL-27 may function
as anti-tumor agent against human (h) PCa. To this end,
in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using hPCa
cell lines.
We first assessed the expression of both chains of
IL-27R, i.e. gp130 and WSX-1 [18,19], in human PC3,
DU145, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, by flow cytometry.

Panel A and B. Expression of WSX-1 (Panel A) and gp130 (panel B) was analysed in PC3, DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells by flow
cytometry. Open profile: WSX-1 (panel A) and gp130 (panel B) staining. Dark profile: isotype matched mAb staining. Experiments were
performed at least in triplicate. Panel C. Western blot analyses of WSX-1 in nuclear extracts (n.e.) and membrane extracts (m.e.) from
22Rv1 and DU145 cells. Nuclear extracts were used as negative controls. A specific 70 kDalton (Da) band, corresponding to WSX-1
protein, was observed in membrane but not nuclear extracts obtained from DU145 cells. Panel D. IL-27 inhibits PC3 cell proliferation in
vitro, as assessed by CFSE staining. PC3 cells were cultured for 48 and 120 hours with medium alone (left panel) or in the presence of 100
ng/ml hrIL-27 (middle panel). Flow cytometry analyses showed that IL-27 inhibited PC3 cell proliferation after 120 hours of treatment
(middle and right panel), as indicated by the higher CFSE intensity in hrIL-27 treated PC3 cells compared to untreated cells at this time
point (right panel). Panel E. Flow cytometry analyses showed that IL-27 inhibited DU145 (left panel) cell proliferation after 120 hours of
treatment, as indicated by the higher CFSE intensity in hrIL-27 treated cells (dark profile) compared to untreated cells at this time point
(light profile). IL-27 did not affect 22Rv1 (middle panel) or LNCaP (right panel) cell proliferation at the same time point. Panel F. IL-27
did not induce apoptosis after 120 hours of treatment in PC3, DU145, 22Rv1 or LNCaP cells.

cells, express both WSX-1 and gp130 chains at surface
level (Figure 1A and B, respectively), thus indicating
that PC3 and DU145 cells may respond to IL-27. The
expression of WSX-1 in DU145 cells has been confirmed
by western blot (Figure 1C).
To assess the ability of IL-27 to affect hPCa cell
proliferation and apoptosis, cells were cultured with or

without human recombinant (hr) IL-27 for 120 hours and
an aliquot of these cells was harvested every 24 hours
for flow cytometry with CFSE intracellular staining, cell
count or annexin V/PI staining.

DU145 cells in both control (a) and hrIL-27 treated (b) mice. The proliferative activity of PC3 tumors grown in PBS treated animals (c) was
considerably reduced in tumors from hrIL-27 treated animals (d). The histologic feature of poorly differentiated tumor with a solid growth
pattern (e) and endowed with a well-developed vascularization (g) observed in PBS treated animals, was heavily compromised in tumors
from hrIL-27 treated animals which showed multiple foci of ischemic necrosis (f) along with a deficient vascular supply (h). PC3 tumors
revealed a strong expression of the anti-angiogenic chemokine IP-10/CXCL10 (j), which, on the contrary, was barely detected in tumors
from PBS treated animals (i). (a-j: x400). Panel E. Expression profile of genes involved in angiogenic pathways in PC3 (white bars) and

similar behavior was observed in DU145 (Figure 1E left
panel), but not in 22Rv1 or LNCaP (Figure 1E, middle and
right panel, respectively), treated with hrIL-27.
Analysis of apoptotic cells, identified by flow
cytometry as Annexin V+/PI+ cells, revealed that hrIL27 did not induce any significant apoptotic effect in
any cell line, irrespective of the time of treatment. One
representative experiment is shown in Figure 1F. Finally,
direct cell counting of trypan blue stained PC3 and DU145
cells using an automated cell countess, revealed that 120
hour of treatment with hrIL-27 caused a reduction in the
absolute number, but not in the viability measured as ratio
between alive and dead cells, of both PC3 and DU145
cells. In detail, the absolute number of alive PC3 cells
treated with hrIL-27 was 1.15±0.2x106, that of untreated
cells was 2.08±0.3x106, thus indicating that hrIL-27 treated
PC3 cells were 55.1% of untreated cells. Similarly, the
absolute number of alive DU145 cells treated with hrIL27 was 1.3±0.2 x 106, that of untreated cells was 1.8±0.3x
106, thus indicating that hrIL-27 DU145 treated cells were
73% of untreated cells. Taken together, IL-27 exerts, in
vitro, an anti-proliferative but not pro-apoptotic effect
against human PCa cell lines that express the complete
corresponding receptor.

Similarly, tumors developed from DU145

developed in control mice starting from day 9 (P =

removed from animals and used for histological and
immunohistochemical studies.
Immunohistochemical analyses of PC3 and
DU145 tumor masses revealed that both PC3 (Fig. 2C,
a and b) and DU145 (Fig. 2D, a and b) cells express
WSX-1 in vivo with no appreciable difference between
control and hrIL-27-treated tumors. hrIL-27 significantly
decreased their proliferation (P < 0.05), as shown by Ki67 immunostaining (Table 1 and Fig. 2C, c and d; Fig.
2D, c and d), and induced multiple foci of ischemic
necrosis (Fig. 2C, e and f; Fig. 2D, e and f), as assessed
by histology, in association with a defective microvascular
supply, as shown by CD31 immunostaining (Fig. 2C, g
and h; Fig. 2D, g and h and Table1).

IL-27 modulates angiogenesis related gene
expression in PC3 cells in vitro
The histopatological demonstration of IL-27’s
anti-angiogenic effects in vivo, led us find out whether it
affects the expression of genes involved in the angiogenic
pathways in PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro, by PCR Array.
As shown in Figure 2E, hrIL-27 significantly downregulated, in both cell lines, pro-angiogenic genes such
as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)1/
FLT1 (10.6 fold down-regulation in PC3 and 108.8 in
DU145 cells), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3,
7 fold down-regulation in both PC3 and DU145 cells) and
prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (PTGS1, 5.1 fold downregulation in both cell lines). Further pro-angiogenic

We next tested whether hrIL-27 is effective in vivo
on hPCa tumor growth. To this end, PC3 or DU145 cells
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in athymic nude mice
that were subsequently treated with hrIL-27.
The volume of tumors developed after PC3 cell
inoculation did not differ significantly between hrIL-27
treated and control mice until day 34 (Fig. 2A). Significant
differences were apparent at days 37 (P = 0.0192, mean
tumor volume, mtv, in treated mice vs controls: 212 mm3
vs 306 mm3), 41 (P = 0.0005, mtv in treated mice vs

molecules were found to be modulated by hrIL-27
exclusively in PC3 or in DU145 cells. In the former,
hrIL-27 down-regulated mRNA expression of insulinlike growth factor (IGF)1 (9 fold down-regulation), C-C
motif chemokine (CCL)11/eotaxin-1 (8.5 fold downregulation), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 (8 fold
down-regulation), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (7
fold down-regulation) and cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 (5
fold down-regulation). By contrast, in DU145 cells, hrIL27 down-regulated mRNA expression of fibroblast growth
factor (FGF)1 (95.4 fold down-regulation), chemokine
(C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) (5.6 fold down-regulation)

and prokineticin (PROK)2 (4.7 fold down-regulation).
Moreover, hrIL-27 up-regulated mRNA expression of
the anti-angiogenic molecule interferon gamma-induced
protein (IP-10/CXCL)10 (11 fold up-regulation) in PC3
cells and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3)
(4.1 fold up-regulation) in DU145 cells (Fig. 2E).
Immunohistochemistry performed on PC3 tumors grown
in PBS or hrIL-27-treated mice disclosed a stronger IP10/
CXCL10 expression in those from the latter group as
evidence of its involvement in the anti-angiogenic effect
displayed by IL-27 in vivo (Fig. 2C, i and j).

WSX-1 is lost in high grade and advanced
stages PCa, but expressed by tumor infiltrating
leukocytes (TIL) and endothelial cells
To determine whether hPCa patients could
benefit from IL-27’s anti-tumor effects, we next
immunohistochemically evaluated expression and
distribution of IL-27R in prostate tissue sections from
PCa patients following radical prostatectomy (RP). Since
expression of glycoprotein gp130 has been reported in
hPCa epithelia [18], we assessed WSX-1 expression
in normal prostate tissue (from both PCa and control
patients) and PCa. It was detected in normal luminal
secretory epithelial cells (Fig. 3A, a) and may be found
in cells with leukocyte features homing normal prostate
stroma. In the cancerous samples, WSX-1 was still
detectable in most well differentiated PCa foci (Gleason ≤
3) (Fig. 3A, arrowheads in b), but was usually lost in the
vast majority of poorly differentiated PCa foci (Gleason
> 3) and in lymph node metastatic nests (Fig. 3A, c and
d). By contrast, WSX-1 was frequent within PCa stroma,
in infiltrating cells with leukocyte features, in small
vessel endothelia (Fig. 3A, e and f), and in immune cells
homing prostate draining lymph node microenvironment.
This pattern of WSX-1 expression in the tumor
microenvironment was observed in both low and high
grade PCa. Double immunostaining exactly located WSX1 expression, in the primary tumor and draining lymph
nodes, on immune cells endowed with CD11c+ and CD4+
phenotype, to a lesser extent (Fig. 3B, a and b), and rarely
on CD8+ phenotype.

DISCUSSION

WSX-1 expression in normal prostate, primary PCa and lymph
node metastasis. WSX-1 was expressed by luminal secretory
epithelia in normal prostate (a) and low-grade PCa foci (indicated
by arrowheads in b), and usually lost in primary PCa (c) and
lymph node metastasis (d), but could be found on immune cells
infiltrating PCa stroma (e) and in microvessel endothelia (f). (a:
x630; b-d: x400). (B) WSX-1 expression in PCa stroma. Double
immunohistochemistry located WSX-1 expression (brown) on
cells endowed with CD11c+ (fuchsia) (a) and CD4+ (fuchsia) (b)
phenotype, as better shown in the insets (upper left sides). (a, b:

PCa is an age-related malignancy that tends
to develop in men over the age of fifty. Longer life
expectancy will make it a substantial public health concern
in the near future. Its slow growth, however, means that
many men never display cancer-related symptoms, and
eventually die of other causes. Thus, overtreatment and
related side effects may be a growing problem, especially
among older patients.

cases, by a rational and well tolerable immunotherapeutic
approach. The lack of toxicity revealed in preclinical
trials [3] along with the powerful anti-cancer effects
demonstrated in different tumor types [4-17] have driven
our attempt to explore IL-27 as a candidate anti-PCa agent.
IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of a
helical protein, IL-27p28, and a soluble cytokine receptorlike component, EBI3 [19]. Through engagement of its
cognate receptor, IL-27 can activate an intra-cellular
signaling cascade. WSX-1 together with gp130 constitutes
a functional signal-transducing receptor, IL-27R, for IL-27
[20].
Assessment of gp130 and WSX-1 expression in
human PC3, DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cancer cells
revealed that PC3 and DU145 cell lines express complete
IL-27R on the surface. This may explain why these
cells only show a significant biological response to IL27 in vitro in the form of a significant reduction in cell
proliferation and a prominent change in the cancer
cell angiogenic program. IL-27 caused, in both cell
lines, a significant down-regulation of a series of antiangiogenesis related genes namely FGFR3 [21], PTGS1
[22] and, particularly, FLT1 [23], which has been reported
to be firmly and strongly expressed in hPCa [24,25] and
involved in cancer cell proliferation via autocrine VEGF
signaling [26]. Some anti-angiogenesis related genes
were essentially down-regulated in PC3 cells, i.e. MMP2
[27], TNF-alpha [28], CCL11 [29] and the potent proangiogenic factor IGF1 (9 fold down-regulation) which
is deeply involved in prostate carcinogenesis [30,31] and
identified as autocrine proliferation stimulus for hPCa
cells [32]. Whereas others, such as PROK2 [33] and CCL2
[34] were down-regulated just in DU-145 cells.
The only pro-angiogenic genes found up-regulated,
and substantially, were that coding the chemokine IP10/CXCL10 [35] which was also strongly expressed in
vivo by PC3 tumor from IL-27 treated animals, and the
metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP3 [36], in DU145 cells.
In vivo studies revealed that IL-27 hampered PC3
tumor growth in athymic nude mice and significantly
reduced tumor volume after more than one month of
treatment. Such IL-27 anti-tumor activity was related to
the direct inhibition of PC3 angiogenic program towards
an anti-angiogenic phenotype that allows consistent
subversion of the host derived microvascular network
resulting in a heavily compromised architecture and
rarefied endothelial branching. Consistently, in vivo
studies using the DU145 cells revealed a significant and
more rapid inhibition of tumor growth by IL-27 treatment
than that observed using the PC3 cells. This is conceivably
due to the higher surface expression of IL-27R in DU145
cells compared to PC3 cell line.
The imperative need to use immunodeficient mice
for xenograft experiments makes it impossible to assess
involvement of immune cells, particularly the lymphoid
lineage, in the in vivo effects of IL-27. Zolochevska et
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

al. reported that in immunocompetent mice, IL-27 gene
therapy leads to the recruitment, in prostate tumors, of
CD3+CD8+ cells, to a decrease in Gr1+CD11b+CD124+ and
Gr1+CD11b+ cells, putative myeloid derived suppressor
cells, and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells, potential Treg
population [17]. These results suggest that, in PCa, IL27 may function as immuno-stimulatory mediator which
boosts anti-tumor effector cells and restrains immune
suppressor mechanisms.
Analyses of prostate tissues obtained from both low
and high grade PCa patients show that WSX-1 is expressed
mainly by CD11c+ myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes/
macrophages population, CD4+ and, to a lesser extent, by
CD8+ immune cells infiltrating PCa stroma or homing
prostate draining lymph nodes and also by endothelial
cells, thus suggesting that exogenously administered
IL-27 could affect the local tumor microenvironment.
Co-expression of gp130 and WSX-1 (IL-27R) has been
documented, in fact, in a variety of immune cell types
including activated dendritic cells and monocytes, with
greatest expression in the lymphoid lineage, particularly
in T cells, and also in endothelial and epithelial cells [20,
37-39].
Taken as whole, we demonstrate for the first time
that i) IL-27 exerts direct anti-proliferative and antiangiogenic effects on PCa cells expressing IL-27R both in
vitro and in pre-clinical models; ii) in humans, IL-27R is
expressed in well-differentiated and localized PCa, but not
in high grade and advanced stages PCa; iii) in the tumor
stroma, immune and endothelial cells express IL-27R.
Therefore, it is expected that PCa patients bearing
high grade and stage tumor may benefit from the IL-27
immunostimulatory [3] and anti-angiogenic [5] effects
on the tumor microenvironment, whereas, the full anticancer potential of IL-27 may be exploited in patients
who are diagnosed with well-differentiated, slow growing
and localized PCa. This vast category of patients may
never need treatment and only an “active surveillance” is
currently recommended by urologists, while IL-27 based
immunotherapy could be an effective weapon against
unexpected tumor progression.

principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis assay
The human PC3 and DU145 prostatic carcinoma
cell lines were cultured for 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours
with or without 100 ng/ml hrIL-27. Cells were incubated
with 2 µM Carboxy-Fluorescein diacetate Succinimudyl
Ester (CFSE) in RPMI 1% FCS for 15 minutes at 37 °C,
washed in RPMI 10%FCS, plated and analyzed by flow
cytometry at the above-mentioned time points. In addition,
cells were counted every 24 hours after staining with
trypan blue using the authomated cell countess from Life
Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Apoptosis was assessed using the Annexin V-FITC
Kit from Immunostep (Salamanca, E), and apoptotic cells
were identified as Annexin V+/PI+ cells by flow cytometry.

Mouse studies
Four- to six-week-old athymic nude mice (Harlan
Laboratories, Udine, Italy) were housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were performed
in accordance with the current National and International
regulations (EU Directive 2010/63/EU).
Two groups of 8 animals were injected s.c. with
6x106 PC3 cells. One group was treated s.c. with 2 weekly
doses of hrIL-27 (1 mg/mouse/dose) starting from 2 days
after tumor cells injection. The other group was injected
with PBS (controls) according to the same time schedule.
Tumors were measured in situ every three days with a
caliper starting from day fourteen, when palpable masses
were developed. Mice were sacrificed at day fifty-four
when signs of poor health were evident. Two groups of
six PBS or hrIL-27 treated animals were sacrificed 37 days
after PC3 cell injection.
In vivo studies with the DU145 cells were performed
by injecting 6x106 cells s.c. in two groups of eight athymic
nude mice. As of PC3 cell line, one group was used as
controls and the other one was treated with hrIL-27 using
the same time schedule reported above. Tumors were
measured in situ every three days using a caliper starting
from day three, when palpable masses were developed.
Mice were sacrificed at day 14 when signs of poor health
were evident.
Tumors from mice injected with PC3 and with
DU145 cells were removed, formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for histological
and immuno-histochemical analyses.

Cell culture, antibodies, reagents, flow cytometry
and western blot
The human PC3, DU145, 22Rv1 and LNCaP PCa
cell lines (LGC Standards, Teddington, UK) were cultured
in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS (Seromed-BiochromKG,
Berlin, D). hrIL-27 (R&D System, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) was used at 100 ng/ml following titration
experiments. The expression of both chains of IL-27R
was analyzed using FITC conjugated anti-gp130 (R&D
Systems) and PE-conjugated anti-WSX-1 (R&D systems)
mAbs. Isotype-matched antibodies of irrelevant specificity
(Caltag, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used as controls.
Cells were run on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and at least 104 events were
acquired. Data were analyzed with Kaluza analysis
software (Beckman Coulter).
Western blot was performed using membrane and
nuclear extracts (Qproteome cell compartment kit from
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) obtained from 5x106 DU145 or
22Rv1 cells. We choose to use these cell lines since WSX1 was expressed at high level in DU145 cells whereas it
was virtually absent in 22Rv1 cells. Standard procedures
were followed for SDS page and blotting. Twenty µg
of proteins were loaded into 10% SDS poli-acrylamide
gel and 1µg/ml rabbit anti human WSX-1 polyclonal
antibody (Novus Biologicals) was used. After washings,
an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) link antibody
(1:5000) from Cell Signaling was used as secondary

on frozen samples, cryostat sections were fixed in acetone
for 10 minutes and, after washing in PBS/ Tween-20,
incubated with mouse anti-human IP10/CXCL10
antibody (Abcam). Immune complexes were detected
using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Leica Biosystems,
Wetzlar, Germany), then sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin and eosin.
For WSX-1/CD4, WSX-1/CD8 and WSX-1/CD11c
double stainings on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
samples, sections were deparaffinized, treated with
H2O2/3% for 5 minutes to inhibit endogenous peroxidase,
and then washed in H2O. The slices were then incubated
for 30 minutes with the first primary antibody (antiWSX-1) followed by detection with the Bond Polymer
Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Then, sections were incubated
for 30 minutes with the second primary antibody (antiCD4, anti-CD8 and anti-CD11c) followed by detection
with the Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection Kit (Leica
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy micro kit
(Qiagen) from PC3 or DU145 cells cultured overnight
with 100 ng/ml hrIL-27 or medium alone. Contaminant
genomic DNA was removed by Dnase treatment (Qiagen).
RNA was retrotranscribed with the RT2First Strand cDNA
Synthesis kit (SABioscience, Frederick, MD, USA).
Human Angiogenesis (code #PAHS-024Z) RT2PCR
Array and RT2Real-Time SYBR Green/ROX PCR Mix
were from SABioscience. PCR was done on an ABI Prism
7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Gene expression of hrIL-27-treated and
control samples was analyzed separately in different PCR
Array plates. Results for each plate were normalized on
the median value of a set of housekeeping genes. Changes
in gene expression between hrIL-27 treated and control
samples were then calculated using the ΔΔCt formula.
Results (obtained in duplicate) were pooled and analyzed
with the software provided by the manufacturer. A
significant threshold of 4-fold change in gene expression
corresponded to P < 0.001.

Statistical analysis

Morphologic and immunohistochemical analyses

Tumor volumes were reported in mm3 versus
time. Data of microvessel density and Ki-67 positive
cell counts were reported as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Differences in tumor volume, vessel counts or
proliferating cell percentage between tumors from hrIL-27
or PBS treated mice were assessed by Student’s t-test. The
Mann–Whitney U probability test was used to examine
the association between IP-10/CXCL10 staining and the
hrIL-27 treatment. The SPSS software, version 11.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA) was employed, with P < 0.05 as the
significance cut-off.

For histology, paraffin-embedded samples were
sectioned at 4 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
For immunohistochemistry on the formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded samples, sections were deparaffinized
and subsequently incubated for 30 minutes with primary
antibodies listed in Table 2. For immunohistochemistry
