Abstract
Deregulation of the b-catenin signaling has long been associated with cancer. Intracellular components of this pathway,
including axin, APC, and b-catenin, are frequently mutated in a
range of human tumors, but the contribution of speciﬁc extracellular ligands that promote cancer development through this
signaling axis remains unclear. We conducted a reporter-based
screen in a panel of human tumors to identify secreted factors that
stimulate b-catenin signaling. Through this screen and further
molecular characterization, we found that R-spondin (RSPO)
proteins collaborate with Wnt proteins to activate b-catenin.
RSPO family members were expressed in several human tumors
representing multiple malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, colon, breast, and lung cancer. We generated speciﬁc mono-

clonal antibody antagonists of RSPO family members and found
that anti-RSPO treatment markedly inhibited tumor growth in
human patient-derived tumor xenograft models, either as single
agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore,
blocking RSPO signaling reduced the tumorigenicity of cancer
cells based on serial transplantation studies. Moreover, geneexpression analyses revealed that anti-RSPO treatment in responsive tumors strongly inhibited b-catenin target genes known to be
associated with cancer and normal stem cells. Collectively, our
results suggest that the RSPO family is an important stimulator of
b-catenin activity in many human tumors and highlight a new
effective approach for therapeutically modulating this fundamental signaling axis. Cancer Res; 76(3); 713–23. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

However, no WNT ligand overexpression has yet been directly
associated to the disease in humans (3).
The R-spondin (RSPO) family of four proteins represents
another group of secreted factors that enhance b-catenin signaling. RSPO1-4 have a similar structure and harbor two furin
domains, which are necessary and sufﬁcient for b-catenin activation, and one thrombospondin type I domain, which promotes
non-canonical Wnt signaling (4, 5). Three classes of transmembrane proteins have been discovered that interact with RSPO:
syndecans, Leu-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGR), and E3 ubiquitin ligases (5–10). Of note, one of these
receptors, LGR5, is a robust marker of stem cells (11–18). A
mechanism of action for RSPO has been elucidated; RSPOs
protect frizzled receptors from internalization and degradation
and recruit IQGAP1 into the Wnt signaling complex, leading
to both an increase in b-catenin and Rho GTPase signaling
activities (9, 19). The LGR receptors involved in this process are
members of the superfamily of seven-transmembrane receptors,
suggesting the potential for additional signaling mechanisms
elicited by RPSO.
Like WNTs, RSPOs have important roles in development and
act as powerful stem cell growth factors (20). RSPO1 is used as an
indispensable agent for in vitro propagation of intestinal stem cells
and its activity cannot be replaced by exogenous WNT protein
(21). In vivo, RSPO1 controls the phenotypic sex of humans and
mice, RSPO2 is necessary for development of numerous mouse
organs, RSPO3 is involved in angiogenesis during placenta

b-catenin signaling is essential to developmental processes
and is deregulated in a wide range of diseases, including cancer
(1–3). WNT ligands are able to activate b-catenin–dependent
signaling by binding to frizzled (FZD) receptor and LRP5/6
coreceptor complex, inducing the release of unphosphorylated
b-catenin from a cytosolic destruction complex comprised of
axin, APC, CKI, and GSK3 and its translocation to the nucleus
where it associates with the TCF/LEF family of transcription
factors and induces canonical gene transcription. Intracellular
components of the signaling pathway such as APC, axin, and
b-catenin itself are mutated in a number of human cancers.

development in mice, and RSPO4 is the gene disrupted in humans
with congenital anonychia (22). In most cases, RSPOs function by
enhancing Wnt/b-catenin signaling. However, RSPO2 or 3 were
also shown to signal through cascades that are separate from the
canonical pathway (5, 8, 19, 23–25).
Several lines of evidence suggest a role for RSPOs in cancer
development. The identiﬁcation of Rspo2 and Rspo3 as sites of
integration for MMTV-induced mammary tumors in mice supported a role as breast cancer oncogenes (26–28). Ectopic expression of Rspo2 was shown to increase tumorigenic and invasive
properties of mouse breast cell lines (25). Genomic rearrangements and transcriptional activation in human tumors that result
in elevated RSPO expression have been identiﬁed, suggesting that
RSPO may be functionally important for tumor development
(29–32). However, no direct demonstration of a functional role
for RSPO in cancer development and maintenance has been
reported to date.
Here, we report an analysis of patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
tumor samples for RSPO expression and activity. Functional
RSPO activity was found to be produced by human tumors of
multiple types. The importance of RSPO in driving the growth of
overexpressing tumors was tested in vivo with anti-RSPO monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against various members of the
family. Efﬁcacy was observed in PDX models established with
minimally passaged human tumors of multiple types. Geneexpression analyses revealed that RSPO promoted expression of
genes associated with the Wnt signaling pathway and normal and
cancer stem cells (CSC). These data provide the ﬁrst demonstration that RSPO family members play a major role in the growth of
human cancer and validate RSPO1-3 as therapeutic targets.

Materials and Methods
Xenograft models and tissue processing
NOD/SCID mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories
and maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions and
provided with sterile food and water ad libitum. Animals were
housed in a U.S. Department of Agriculture-registered facility in
accordance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
animals. The mice were allowed to acclimate for several days
before the studies.
The establishment of OMP PDX models was described previously (33). Patient-derived tumors were passaged in mice without
any intervening cell culture. Tumor cells were stored in liquid
nitrogen. Experiments for obtaining fresh tumor cells or testing
antibody therapeutic efﬁcacy were initiated from frozen cell
stocks. CR3150, CR1560, CR2506, and CR2513 models were
established at Crown BioScience (Beijing, China).
For in vitro assays and in vivo tumorigenicity assessments, singlecell suspensions were obtained from freshly dissociated tumors
according to a previously described procedure (34). Cells were
then incubated with biotinylated antibodies (a-mouse CD45biotin 1:200 dilution and a-mouse H2Kd-biotin 1:100 dilution;
BioLegend) on ice for 30 minutes followed by addition of 50 mL
MagnaBind streptavadin-labeled magnetic beads (Thermo Scientiﬁc) per 10E6 cells/mL. Mouse cells were removed on a magnetic
stand.
Cell lines
The HEK-293 STF cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Jeremy
Nathans (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD)

714 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

received in 2005. It contains the TOP-FLASH reporter system
comprised of 8 copies of a TCF-binding site (AGATCAAAGG)
upstream of a minimal promoter and ﬁreﬂy luciferase. Cells were
cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, 500 mg/mL Geneticin (Life Technologies) and incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2. HEK-293T (CRL3216) and WNT3A-L cells (CRL-2647) were obtained in 2005
from the ATCC and cultured according to the ATCC guidelines.
STF reporter assay
Tumor cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS (Life Technologies) for 24 hours at 37 C and 5% CO2. One volume of
conditioned medium and cells was added on top of a monolayer
of HEK-293 STF cells grown in 1 volume of DMEM, 10% FBS.
When used, 5 ng/mL of recombinant human RSPO (R&D Systems) were added to the reporter cells. WNT3A-conditioned
medium prepared from WNT3A-L cells was added to the tumor
cell conditioned medium or puriﬁed RSPO at a ﬁnal concentration of 25% v/v. The activity of puriﬁed soluble receptors
(10 mg/mL) and mAbs (40 mg/mL) was compared with the
control immunoadhesin JAG1-Fc and control antibody LZ1.
Reporter cells were incubated for 16 hours before luciferase
activity measurement using Steady-Glo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).
Real-time RT-PCR
For RSPO gene-expression analyses, RNA was extracted from
xenograft tumors using an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue mini kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty
ng RNA were submitted to a one-step RT-PCR reaction using
Applied Biosystems 7900HT instrument and buffer system
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). GUSB was used as endogenous control against which DCts
were calculated and the lowest RSPO expressing sample as
baseline for the DDCt calculations. Relative expressions were
determined by raising 2 to the power of the negative value of
DDCt for each sample. All gene-expression assays were purchased from ABI and veriﬁed for species speciﬁcity before
screening the OMP PDXs.

Antibodies
Anti-RSPO antibodies were generated by immunizing mice
with puriﬁed recombinant human RSPO1, RSPO2, or RSPO3
(R&D Systems) followed by hybridoma generation and characterization. The antibodies LZ1, an anti-lysozyme monoclonal
generated by panning a phage display library obtained from
MorphoSys (Martinsried/Planegg) and 1B711, a murine monoclonal directed against dinitrophenol (anti-hapten) and
obtained from the ATCC were used as negative controls in the
in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively (35). Anti-RPSO3
mAb #2 was isolated by a mammalian cell antibody display
technique, MAbTrap, in which antibody sequences derived
from the immunized mice were transiently expressed and then
retained on the cell surface by interaction with a membraneanchored CH2-CH3 antibody fragment. FACS was used to
isolate cells expressing the antibody of interest and corresponding cDNA isolated.
The binding of anti-RSPO antibodies to RSPO was assessed
by ﬂow cytometry. First, HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNA expression vectors for RSPO extracellular
domain fused to human CD4 transmembrane domain fused
to GFP using Fugene 6 (Promega). Transfected cells were then
incubated with 20 mg/mL antibody and washed with PBS.
Antibody binding was detected with a PE-conjugated antimouse Fc antibody and light signals measured for PE and GFP,
using a Canto II instrument (BD Biosciences).
To assess ability of anti-RSPO antibodies to block interaction with LGR, binding studies were conducted. RSPO proteins were expressed as Fc fusion proteins containing RSPO
N-terminal furin domains and human IgG1 Fc. HEK-293T
cells were transiently transfected with cDNA expression vector
encoding the N-terminal extracellular domain of human LGR
fused to human CD4 transmembrane domain fused to GFP.
After 24 hours, cells were incubated with RSPO–Fc fusion
proteins and anti-RSPO antibodies at 10 mg/mL. RSPO binding was detected by ﬂow cytometry with a PE-conjugated antihuman Fc antibody and light signals measured for PE and
GFP.
In vivo efﬁcacy experiments
About 50,000 freshly thawed tumor cells re-suspended in
100 mL 50% Matrigel in FACS buffer (OMP PDXs) or tumor

fragments (Crown BioScience PDXs) were injected s.c. into the
left ﬂank region of 6- to 8-week-old NOD/SCID mice with a
25-gauge needle. Tumor-bearing animals were randomized
and treatment started when the mean tumor volumes reached
100 to 150 mm3. Chemotherapeutic agents were given once
weekly at various doses ranging from 10 to 100 mg/kg as
speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends. Antibodies were dosed once
weekly or biweekly at a dose ranging from 10 to 25 mg/kg. All
agents were administered i.p.
For the tumorigenicity study, single tumor cell suspensions
prepared as described from control and treated tumors were
counted and diluted to 50 cells in 100 mL 50% Matrigel in FACS
buffer. Ten NOD/SCID mice were injected s.c. per group.
Tumor growth was monitored for 59 days without any further
treatment.
Microarray analysis
RNA was isolated and microarray analyses were conducted
as detailed in Supplementary Data. Data are available through
GEO database, accession GSE73906.

Results
Identiﬁcation of RSPO as a tumor-derived b-catenin
stimulating activity
To identify possible b-catenin–stimulating activities produced by human tumor cells, a functional screen was developed. Tumor cells freshly obtained from minimally passaged
PDXs (referred to as OMP-xxxx tumors hereafter, where xxxx
refers to our internal nomenclature for that tumor PDX line)
were cocultured with an HEK-293 cell-based reporter cell
line containing a TCF-luciferase reporter (STF). This reporter
cell line responds to WNT and RSPO signals through b-catenin–
driven transcription. Forty eight OMP tumors (Supplementary
Table S1) were screened in this assay, of which, three (6.25%)
induced reporter activity more than 2-fold relative to control
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2). OMP-LU2, OMP-LU25,
and OMP-OV38 induced luciferase activity 6.7-, 4.7-, and 3.1fold over medium alone, respectively. In this survey, WNT3A
was also tested, alone as a positive control and added to
the coculture assay. Interestingly, the three tumors that were
positive for b-catenin signaling activity displayed further elevated activation upon addition of WNT3A (Fig. 1A). OMP-LU2,
OMP-LU25, and OMP-OV38 boosted WNT3A activity 4.3-, 9.6-,
and 1.6-fold over WNT3A alone. Such potentiation of WNT
has been noted as a hallmark of RSPO activity, suggesting that
RSPO ligands might be responsible for the activation of the
b-catenin reporter in the assay (4). Of note, additional OMP
tumors were shown to score in the assay only in the presence of
WNT3A, possibly reﬂecting lower levels of the b-catenin activating factor(s). OMP-B37, OMP-B39, and OMP-LU102
increased WNT3A activity 2.7-, 9-, and 1.8-fold, respectively
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2). To examine the tumorderived activity further, FZD8-Fc and LGR5-Fc decoy receptors
were tested in the assay. FZD8-Fc acts as an inhibitor of Wnt
signaling by binding WNT ligands, whereas LGR5-Fc binds to
RSPO and antagonizes RSPO potentiation of Wnt signaling
(Fig. 1B and C). In conditions in which FZD8-Fc abolished
WNT3A-induced reporter activity, it partially inhibited the
activity induced by the tumor cells alone and dramatically
decreased the activity induced by the tumor cells in presence

Detection of OMP tumor sample-derived b-catenin activation. The ability of human tumor-derived soluble factors to activate b-catenin was assessed in the
STF assay. A, fold inductions are shown for a subset of the 48 OMP tumor samples tested. They represent the ratio of tumor (red bars), WNT3A (green bars),
and tumor þ WNT3A (purple bars)-induced luciferase activity relative to the medium alone. B, FZD8.Fc inhibitory activity was demonstrated in
the STF reporter assay. STF cells were exposed to WNT3A or non-WNT3A (solid triangle) conditioned medium supplemented with the indicated
concentrations of FZD8.Fc (hollow dots). Mouse JAG1-Fc (solid dots) was used as negative control. Results are displayed as luciferase activity levels (RLU,
relative light units) as a function of the test agent's concentration (mg/mL). C, serial dilutions of LGR5.Fc were used to inhibit the induction of luciferase by
RSPO1 (squares), RSPO2 (circles), RSPO3 (triangles), or RSPO4 (diamonds) added to WNT3A-conditioned medium. Results are shown as the measured
RLUs as a function of the decoy protein concentration. D, both FZD8.Fc and LGR5.Fc inhibited the luciferase reporter activity (RLUs) of STF cells stimulated
with tumor cell cultures supplemented (purple bars) or not (red bars) with WNT3A. WNT3A activity was only inhibited by FZD8.Fc (green bars).

of exogenously added WNT3A. Conversely, although LGR5-Fc
remained mostly ineffective at inhibiting WNT3A alone, it
efﬁciently decreased the activity of the tumor cells alone and
supplemented with WNT3A. LGR5-Fc reduced the activity of
the cocultures containing added WNT3A to a level comparable
with that observed with WNT3A alone (Fig. 1D). These results
suggest that the activation of the b-catenin reporter observed in
the tumor cell culture assay reﬂects the presence of RSPO activity
potentiating low levels of endogenous WNT ligands. The modest inhibition of the tumor-induced activation by FZD8-Fc
suggests the presence of a distinct (WNT or non-WNT) ligand
not bound by FZD8-Fc.
Interestingly, the tumors previously found to exhibit
b-catenin activity possessed markedly elevated levels of particular RSPO family members. Generally, only a single RPSO

716 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

family member was highly expressed within a tumor as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2). Thus, OMP-LU2,
OMP-LU25 and OMP-OV38 expressed high levels of RSPO2
or RSPO3. Additional RSPO mRNA-positive tumors, for example, OMP-OV19 and OMP-PN7 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Table S2), had not been identiﬁed by the in vitro functional
assay, maybe due to the low sensitivity of the assay. It has
been reported that RSPO2 and RSPO3 genes are targets of
rearrangements in colon cancer and that resulting fusions increase gene expression (29, 31). On the basis of these reports,
we performed a PCR-based screen and also mRNAseq analysis. These analyses did not ﬁnd fusions in either RSPO2
or RSPO3 in our tumor bank, including RSPO2-high OMPC28, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the

overexpression of RSPO in these tumors. RSPO3-high human
CRC tumors possessing the reported PTPRK–RSPO3 gene
fusion were identiﬁed at an external service provider (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To investigate the functional consequence of inhibiting the
activity of speciﬁc RSPOs, mAbs were generated that bind RSPO1,
RSPO2, or RSPO3 (Fig. 3A) and block the ability of RSPO to
potentiate WNT stimulation of the b-catenin luciferase reporter
through blocking binding to LGR (Fig. 3B and C). All antibodies
were shown to be speciﬁc for their targeted RSPO and not to crossreact with the other RSPOs. Anti-RSPO antibodies were tested for
impact on the tumor-induced b-catenin activity observed in the
luciferase reporter screen. Antibody to RSPO2 blocked the activity
produced by OMP-LU2 tumor cells and antibody to RSPO3
blocked the activity observed in response to OMP-LU25, OMPLU102, and OMP-OV38 tumor cells (Fig. 4). In each case, the
antibodies inhibited the reporter activity back to control levels.
None of the three antibodies affected the reporter activity when
non–b-catenin–inducing tumor cells such as OMP-PN25 and
OMP-M6 were used in the assay (Supplementary Fig. S2). Overall,
the results parallel the relative RSPO gene-expression pattern
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2), strongly implicating the RSPO
proteins as the inducers of the observed b-catenin signaling
activity produced by these human tumor cells. In particular, the
above data revealed RSPO2 or RSPO3 as the principal factors
responsible for the b-catenin activity derived from several of our
patient-derived tumors, making potential therapeutic targets of
RSPO2 and RSPO3.

RSPO antagonists inhibit the growth of human tumor
xenografts
The impact of inhibiting RSPO signaling on tumor growth
was assessed using PDXs in mice. Tumor-bearing mice were
treated with antibodies to individual RSPO family members.
Anti-RSPO treatment produced signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor
growth in several types of human tumors (Fig. 5A). Growth of
OMP-OV19, an ovarian tumor noted to express RSPO1, was
inhibited by antibody to RSPO1. OMP-C28 and OMP-PN7, a
colon and a pancreatic tumor, respectively, noted to express
RSPO2, were inhibited by antibody to RSPO2. Anti-RSPO3
displayed signiﬁcant antitumor activity in several RSPO3high tumors, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
models OMP-LU25 and OMP-LU102, colorectal cancer models
CR3150, CR2513, and CR2506, and ovarian cancer OMPOV38. Colon tumor CR3150 is noteworthy as a tumor possessing a RSPO3 chromosomal translocation identical to those
previously reported (29). Thus, anti-RSPO treatments showed
single-agent therapeutic activity in most RSPO-high models.
Combination with chemotherapy, including taxane treatment
in NSCLC and ovarian models, gemcitabine treatment in pancreatic tumor, and irinotecan in colorectal cancer models,
resulted in further signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth
beyond the impact of chemotherapy alone (Fig. 5A). The
mechanism of combination activity with paclitaxel was investigated in OMP-OV38. Anti-RSPO3 treatment combined with
paclitaxel was found to increase mitotic cell death (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Characterization of anti-RSPO1, RSPO2, and RSPO3 mAbs. RSPO-binding properties of the anti-RSPO mAbs were assessed by ﬂow cytometry. The
ability of anti-RSPO antibodies to inhibit RSPO signaling function was monitored in the cell-based b-catenin reporter assay. A, RSPO1, 2, 3, or 4 was
displayed at the surface of HEK-293 cells by means of a transiently transfected RSPO1, 2, 3, or 4.CD4TM.GFP fusion cDNA expression vector that
tethers RSPO to the cell surface via a transmembrane anchor. Binding of the RSPO moieties by the anti-RSPO1, anti-RSPO2, and two anti-RSPO3 mAbs
was detected using a PE-conjugated secondary antibody. The PE (y axis) and GFP/FITC (x axis) signals are plotted for each individual cell analyzed.
The relative increase of both signals translates speciﬁc antibody binding to the antigen. B, anti-RSPO antibodies' inhibitory activity was conﬁrmed in
the STF reporter assay. STF cells were exposed to WNT3A conditioned medium supplemented with RSPO1, RSPO2, or RSPO3. Anti-RSPO antibodies
were added. Results are displayed as luciferase activity levels (RLU, relative light units). C, LGR5 was displayed at the surface of HEK-293T cells by
means of a transiently transfected LGR5.CD4TM.GFP fusion cDNA expression vector that expresses the N-terminal extracellular domain of LGR5 tethered
to the cell surface via a transmembrane anchor. Ability of anti-RSPO mAb to block the binding of the indicated RSPO was assessed by incubating cells
with RSPO-Fc fusion protein and mAb as indicated and followed by detection of bound RSPO protein with PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary
antibody. Speciﬁc RSPO-LGR5 binding is indicated by detection of cells within the inset box of the ﬂow-cytometry plot.

Not all RSPO-high tumors were sensitive to RSPO inhibition.
For example, the NSCLC OMP-LU2, despite high levels of RPSO2
mRNA, and colorectal cancer CR1560, despite high levels of
RSPO3 mRNA, were not signiﬁcantly inhibited by anti-RSPO2
and anti-RSPO3, respectively, whether alone or combined with
chemotherapy (Fig. 5A). Analysis of LGR4, 5, and 6 gene expressions revealed no correlation between receptor expression and
resistance to antibody treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). Tumors
that did not express RSPO were unresponsive to antibody treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The responsive NSCLC model OMP-LU25 was used to assess
the impact of RSPO3 inhibition on CSCs, also known as tumor
initiating cells. For this, tumors previously treated with antibody
and/or chemotherapy were harvested and processed to a single-

cell suspension and 50 cells were injected into recipient mice for a
second (treatment free) round of propagation. The ability of this
low cell number to re-grow a tumor provided a direct measure of
their CSC content. In such a setting, anti-RSPO3 signiﬁcantly
reduced the tumorigenicity of OMP-LU25 tumor cells both as a
single agent and in combination with paclitaxel (Fig. 5B).
Although all 10 control mice and 8 of 9 paclitaxel group mice
developed tumors, the anti-RSPO3 and combination-treated
tumor cells engrafted poorly (7:10 and 6:10, respectively) and
grew slowly. Similar reductions in tumorigenicity after anti-RSPO
treatment were observed in other tumors, including recently
obtained pancreatic and lung tumors that were not included in
our original panel (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, levels of
CD44, a well-known colon CSC marker, were signiﬁcantly

RSPO blockade inhibits stem cell signaling pathways in
tumors
RSPO1 functions as a potent regulator of stem cell growth in
colon (21). The expression of a panel of genes associated with
stem cell and/or RSPO signaling was, thus, monitored in anti–
RSPO3-treated colorectal cancer xenografts. Control and antibody-treated tumor RNAs from the in vivo efﬁcacy experiments
conducted with CR3150, CR2506, CR2513, and CR1560 were
tested for the expression of ASCL2, AXIN2, CLDN2, LGR5,
PTPRO, RPRD1A, TDGF1, and ZNRF3 genes, using qPCR. Strikingly, 7 of the 8 genes were downregulated in response to antiRSPO3 in all three sensitive colorectal cancer models (Fig. 6).
The downregulation was highly signiﬁcant in at least two of the
models for these genes. For example, ASCL2 expression could
no longer be detected in any of the anti–RSPO3-treated CR2506
and CR2513 samples; LGR5 was downregulated 7.24- and
5.75-fold in treated CR2506 and CR3150 tumors, respectively,
and TDGF1 mRNA levels were reduced in all three models, up
to 234-fold. All 7 downregulated genes are reported canonical
Wnt signaling target genes (36, 37). Several of these genes,
ASCL2, LGR5, and TDGF1, have also been directly associated
with CSCs in various tumor types, supporting a role for the
RSPO pathway in CSC biology and consistent with the in vivo
tumorigenicity results presented herein (38–40). Downregulation of Wnt and stem cell genes by anti-RSPO treatment could
be involved in the sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents (41, 42). Two of the 8 studied genes, AXIN2 and
ZNRF3, were downregulated by anti-RSPO3 in the nonresponding CR1560 model. The two genes are the only Wnt target genes
of the panel that were highly expressed in this model, possibly
reﬂecting a lower state of Wnt signaling activation. Thus, isolated Wnt targets could be regulated by anti-RSPO3 therapy and

not be associated with growth inhibition of non-RSPO/Wntdriven tumors.
To further study the mechanism of action of RSPO3, microarray
analysis was performed on anti–RSPO3-treated colon tumors.
Findings were consistent with the qPCR results (Fig. 6) and also
revealed new insights into the RSPO3 mechanism of action
(Supplementary Table S3). In the three responsive models, modulation of Wnt signaling was conﬁrmed by the downregulation of
numerous Wnt genes that included CLDN2, EPHB2, CD44, LRP4,
ASCL2, AXIN2, LGR5, PTPRO, TDGF1, and ZNRF3. In addition,
effects on Notch signaling were revealed by the downregulation of
genes such as NOTCH1 and PSEN1. Both Wnt and Notch pathways are associated with CSCs (43–45). Consistently, numerous
stem cell genes were inhibited by anti-RSPO3 in the three responders. Interestingly, differentiation genes, including BAMBI,
CADM1, POU2F2, and RGS2 were upregulated. Most of the genes
described above were not signiﬁcantly modulated by anti-RSPO3
in the nonresponsive CR1560. Together, these results show that
RSPO3 blockade inhibited CSC signaling pathways in colorectal
cancer, and suggest that the tumor cells may adopt a more
differentiated cell fate. Microarray data for anti-RSPO3 plus
irinotecan-treated CR2506 further support this mechanism by
showing that most Wnt and stem cell genes targeted by antiRSPO3 remained modulated upon addition of chemotherapeutics, with some of them responding to a greater extent to the
combination than to anti-RSPO3 alone (Supplementary Table
S3). Overall, the gene-expression data support the inhibition of
self-renewal pathways as the main mechanism of anti-RSPO3's
antitumor activity.

Discussion
Because the initial discovery of WNT1 as a gene product
capable of promoting breast cancer thirty years ago, there
has been a recognition that this signaling pathway may contribute to human cancer (46). This recognition has been greatly

tumor growth in vivo using speciﬁc anti-RSPO antibodies. Ovarian (OMP-OV19 and -OV38), pancreatic (OMP-PN7), lung (OMP-LU2,
-LU25, and -LU102), and colorectal (OMP-C28, CR3150, CR2513, CR2506, and CR1560) xenograft models were treated with anti-RSPO1 (green symbols),
anti-RSPO2 (blue symbols), or anti-RSPO3 mAb2 (red symbols) antibody alone (up-pointing triangles) or in combination with chemo (down-pointing
triangles) to assess the role of RSPO in driving the in vivo growth of these models. Anti-RSPO1 was used at 10 mg/kg once weekly; anti-RSPO2 was used at
10 (OMP-PN7) or 15 (OMP-LU2) mg/kg once weekly or 25 mg/kg every other week (OMP-C28); anti-RSPO3 mAb2 was used at 25 mg/kg once weekly.
The chemo agents and regimens were as follows: 15 mg/kg taxol once weekly for OMP-OV19, -OV38, and –LU25, 10 mg/kg taxol once weekly for OMP-LU2, 100
mg/kg gemcitabine once weekly for OMP-PN7, and 10 mg/kg irinotecan once weekly for OMP-C28, CR3150, CR2513, CR2506, and CR1560. A, tumor volumes
were measured weekly, averaged for each treatment group (n ¼ 10) and graphed as a function of time to obtain growth curves relative to the control antibody
(open black circles) and chemo (black circles) groups. Tumor models were deemed responsive when P values calculated using a two-way ANOVA analysis
and Bonferroni post-tests were <0.05 ( ), <0.01 (  ), or <0.001 (   ) at termination. Antibody alone was compared with control antibody and chemo
combination was compared with control antibody þ chemo agent as depicted by black vertical lines on the graphs. B, the tumorigenicity of anti–RSPO3treated OMP-LU25 tumors was assessed upon passaging low cell doses in na€ve NOD/SCID mice. All 10 individual tumor volumes were plotted for each group
after 100% take rate was observed in the control group.

strengthened by the understanding that intracellular components of the signaling cascade, APC, axin, and b-catenin, are
mutated in approximately 90% of human colon tumors (47).
Mutations in Wnt pathway components have also now been
observed in a broad range of human tumors (3). Recently,
therapeutic agents have been developed that target the Wnt
pathway, and these agents show efﬁcacy in a range of preclinical
tumor models (43, 48). OMP-18R5 (vantictumab), an antibody
that functions by blocking WNT binding to 5 of the 10 human
frizzled receptors, demonstrates activity in inhibiting the growth
of a range of human tumor xenograft models, indicating that
extracellular Wnt pathway signals play an important role in the
growth of many human tumors. Despite this progress, a major
unanswered question remains the speciﬁc contribution of various members of the large family of WNT ligands in human
tumors, and other signaling proteins that might contribute to
b-catenin activation, particularly in tumors that do not possess
known mutations impacting intracellular signaling components. For instance, despite the demonstration that murine
WNT1 can drive the formation of breast tumors when over-

720 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

expressed due to retroviral MMTV integration, there has not
been clear evidence that WNT1 is frequently overexpressed
in human tumors. To address this question of which factor
might be responsible for driving b-catenin signaling in human
tumors, we surveyed a series of human tumors for production
of b-catenin signaling activity using a functional reporter
assay. This effort has identiﬁed RSPO family members as important stimulators of b-catenin signaling activity in a number
of human tumors. Patient-derived lung and ovarian tumor
cells were shown to induce b-catenin activation in an in vitro
cell-based assay and the activity was directly dependent on
RSPO2 or RSPO3 expression as demonstrated using speciﬁc
blocking anti-RSPO antibodies. Interestingly, although RSPO1or RSPO4-high tumors were identiﬁed, none of them displayed
any detectable activity in the STF coculture assay. This could
reﬂect the assay detection limit or/and the induction of differential b-catenin activation levels by different RSPO proteins.
Subsequently, the growth of several of the RSPO-producing
tumors was shown to be driven by the RSPO activity when
implanted in NOD/SCID mice. Using anti-RSPO antibodies

alone and in combination with standard of care chemotherapeutic agents, we were able to signiﬁcantly decrease the growth
rate of RSPO3-positive lung and ovarian tumors that were
identiﬁed in our cell-based screen. In addition, RSPO-expressing tumors with no detectable ex vivo b-catenin–activating
properties, were also shown to respond to antibody-mediated
anti-RSPO treatment. Anti-RSPO1 was shown to inhibit the in
vivo growth of an RSPO1-high ovarian tumor and anti-RSPO2
that of RSPO2-high colon and pancreas tumors. This suggests
that the reporter assay used to monitor tumor cell–derived
RSPO activity is not sensitive enough to allow for detecting low
levels of functional RSPO or that a b-catenin–independent
function of RSPO is at play in these models. Our results also
suggest that gene-expression analysis may be sufﬁcient to
identify tumors that respond to anti-RSPO therapy. Accordingly, three xenograft models in which no RSPO gene expression
was detected failed to respond to antibody-mediated RSPO
inhibition. Testing additional models will be required to further deﬁning minimal RSPO gene-expression levels associated
with anti-RSPO treatment sensitivity. Finally, the identiﬁcation
of an anti-RSPO2 antibody-resistant lung tumor and an anti–
RSPO3-resistant colon tumor despite respective high RSPO2
and RSPO3 expression indicates that not all instances of high
RSPO expression may reﬂect tumor dependence upon this
signaling axis. Of note, RSPO4 was not tested as a therapeutic
target in this work. However, its relative prevalence across the
OMP tumor bank supports evaluating RSPO4 in future studies.
Overall, the comprehensive set of in vivo efﬁcacy data presented
here demonstrates the therapeutic value of RSPO blockade to
treat RSPO-expressing tumors.
In anti–RSPO3-sensitive colorectal cancer models, the signiﬁcant downregulation of target genes associated with both
normal stem cells and CSCs supports a mechanism of action by

which the antibody would inhibit tumor growth by decreasing
CSC frequency, a most desirable outcome for long-term cancer
therapies. CSCs are deﬁned as the most tumorigenic subset
of malignant cells that supports tumor growth by conferring
stem cell properties, including self-renewal and multipotency
to tumor cells (49). The major impact of RSPO on stem cells is
thought to be due to RSPO potentiation of the Wnt/b-catenin
signaling and thus, one hypothesis is that RSPO may have
limited signaling activity in absence of WNT ligands (4, 50).
In this model, tumors may achieve enhanced b-catenin signaling by elevated RSPO, which functions to potentiate low
levels of WNT that are present in the tumor microenvironment,
rather than by substantial upregulation of the expression of
WNT family members. Thus, it appears that, in many tumors, a
synergistic potentiation of b-catenin function is mediated by
tumor-derived RSPO and blocking RSPO represents a most
efﬁcient therapeutic approach in these tumors.
