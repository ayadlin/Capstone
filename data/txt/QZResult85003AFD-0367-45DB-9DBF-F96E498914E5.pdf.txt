Abstract
High-dose endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide II
(EMAP-II), a tumor-derived antiangiogenic cytokine, can
sensitize tumor vasculature to the damaging activity of highdose tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-A. However, this combination cannot be used for systemic treatment of patients because
of prohibitive toxicity. We have found that this limitation can
be overcome by combining a TNF-targeting strategy with the
use of ultra low-dose EMAP-II. Coadministration of 0.1 ng of
EMAP-II and 0.1 ng of CNGRCG-TNF (NGR-TNF), a peptideTNF conjugate able to target tumor blood vessels, inhibited
lymphoma and melanoma growth in mice, with no evidence of
toxicity. This drug combination induced endothelial cell
apoptosis in vivo and, at later time points, caused reduction
of vessel density and massive apoptosis of tumor cells. Liganddirected targeting of TNF was critical because the combination of nontargeted TNF with EMAP-II was inactive in these
murine models. The synergism was progressively lost when the
dose of EMAP-II was increased in the nanogram to microgram
range, supporting the concept that the use of low-dose
EMAP-II is critical. Studies on the mechanism of this
paradoxical behavior showed that EMAP-II doses >1 ng induce
the release of soluble TNF receptor 1 in circulation, a strong
counter-regulatory inhibitor of TNF. Tumor vascular targeting
with extremely low amounts of these cytokines may represent
a new strategy for cancer treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):

Introduction
Tumor cell survival, proliferation, and invasion critically depend
on the presence of functional blood vessels in the tumor stroma
(1, 2). The use of tumor vascular targeting agents and antiangiogenic molecules capable of damaging existing vessels and
inhibiting the formation of new vessels is a promising approach
for cancer treatment (1, 3). Among the vascular targeting agents
identified thus far, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) is undoubtedly
one of the most efficient, due its strong ability to cause selective
obliteration and damage of tumor neovasculature (4, 5). For these
reasons and for its capability to activate inflammatory-immune
mechanisms, this cytokine is currently used in patients for
locoregional treatment of tumors of the extremities (6–9).

Unfortunately, the clinical use of TNF is limited to locoregional
treatments because of prohibitive systemic toxicity.
Recent studies have shown that soluble factors produced by
tumors can contribute to sensitize tumor blood vessels to the
vascular damaging and procoagulant activity of TNF. For instance,
endothelial-monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II), a
soluble tumor-derived cytokine originally discovered in the
supernatant of methylcholanthrene A–induced murine fibrosarcoma cells, can alter endothelial functions and sensitize tumor
neovasculature to TNF (3, 10–13). Interestingly, complete responses
in melanoma patients treated with TNF, by isolated limb perfusion,
correlate with increased EMAP-II expression in biopsies (14),
suggesting that local production of EMAP-II is critical for the
antitumor activity of TNF. Accordingly, transfection of TNFresistant melanomas with the EMAP-II gene rendered tumors
sensitive to systemic TNF therapy (12, 15), and local injection of
high-dose EMAP-II (10 Ag) into murine mammary adenocarcinomas increased tumor sensitivity to subsequent systemic administration of high dose-TNF, causing local acute thrombohemorrhage
(11). Studies on the mechanism of action have shown that EMAP-II
can up-regulate the expression of tissue factor, von Willebrand
factor, E-selectin, P-selectin, and p55-TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1)
mRNA in tumor vascular endothelial cells (11, 16). EMAP-II can
also inhibit endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin, promote
endothelial cell apoptosis, and exert antiangiogenic effects (17, 18).
Furthermore, this cytokine can activate monocyte/macrophage
and granulocyte chemotaxis and induce the release of TNF and
other cytokines by monocytes (11).
The remarkable synergistic effects of EMAP-II and TNF observed
in animal models have continued to nourish hopes with regard to
the possibility of exploiting the powerful antivascular effects of
TNF for systemic treatment of cancer patients. Unfortunately, also
the systemic administration of high-dose EMAP-II/TNF induces
toxic reactions and the efficacy of nontoxic doses of this
combination is very low.
In the attempt to overcome this limitation, we have investigated
in murine models the antitumor properties of EMAP-II in
combination with low doses of NGR-TNF, a TNF derivative
currently tested in phase I and II clinical studies. NGR-TNF
consists of TNF fused with the COOH terminus of the CNGRCG
peptide, a ligand of aminopeptidase N (CD13) expressed by
endothelial cells in tumor vessels. Previous studies showed that
targeted delivery of low doses of NGR-TNF to the tumor
vasculature is a valuable strategy for overcoming major TNF
counter-regulatory mechanisms and for increasing the penetration
of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumors (19–21). We have unexpectedly found that EMAP-II completely suppresses, rather than
increases, the antitumor properties of low-dose NGR-TNF, either
alone or in combination with chemotherapy. However, we have

also found that administration of low doses of EMAP-II, various
orders of magnitude lower than the dose currently used in animal
models, induces strong synergistic antitumor effects with NGRTNF, leading to marked apoptosis of tumor cells and inhibition of
tumor growth, with no evidence of toxicity. We also provide
evidence to suggest that the mechanism underlying this paradoxical behavior is related to dose-dependent activation of TNF
counter-regulatory mechanisms by EMAP-II, such as soluble TNF
receptor shedding.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were isolated from human umbilical cord vein by collagenase
treatment as described (22), following ethical approval, and cultured in 1%
gelatin–coated flasks (Falcon, Becton Dickinson) using endotoxin-free
Medium 199 (BioWhittaker, Cambrex Bio Science Verviers) containing 20%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% bovine retinal-derived
growth factor, 90 Ag/mL heparin, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Biochrom; M199 complete medium). All experiments were
carried out with HUVEC at passages 1 to 4. Human microvasculature
endothelial cells, HMEC-1, were provided by Dr. A. Manfredi (San Raffaele
Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy). Mouse B16F1 melanoma cells and RMA
lymphoma cells were cultured as previously described (19, 23).
4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was from Invitrogen and normal
goat serum was from Vector Laboratories. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal
anti–EMAP-II antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich; rat anti-mouse CD31
monoclonal antibody (mAb) MEC 13.3 was from BD PharMingen; rabbit
anti–cleaved caspase-3 polyclonal antibody, purified by protein A and
peptide affinity chromatography, was from Cell Signaling Technology.
AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and AlexaFluor 546 goat antirat IgG (H + L) were from Invitrogen.
Preparation of NGR-TNF and murine EMAP-II. Murine and human
NGR-TNF (consisting of murine or human TNF fused with the COOH
terminus of CNGRCG) were prepared by recombinant DNA technology and
purified from E. coli cell extracts as previously described (19). Mature
EMAP-II was prepared as follows: the cDNA coding for murine EMAP-II
(residues 145–310) was amplified by PCR on the cDNA obtained by reverse
transcriptase-PCR on total RNA of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts using the following
primers: 5¶-CACCATGTCCAAGCCTATCGACGCATC-3¶ ( forward primer)
and 5¶-TCATTTAATTCCACTATTGGCCATGG-3¶ (reverse primer). The
forward primer, including the CACC sequence, was designed to enable
directional cloning of the EMAP-II gene into the pET101/D-TOPO vector of
the Champion pET Directional TOPO Expression Kit (Invitrogen). E. coli
BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with this plasmid and left to grow
overnight in 10 mL of Luria-Bertani/Miller broth containing 100 Ag/mL
ampicillin. The culture was diluted 1:50 with fresh medium and left to grow
at 37jC until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.7 units. Isopropyl-Dthiogalactopyranoside (1 mmol/L) was then added to the culture to induce
EMAP-II expression. After 3 h at 37jC, cells were harvested by
centrifugation (4,000  g, 20 min, 4jC) and resuspended in 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmol/L benzamidine, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.075% octyl-h-D-glucoside, and 4 units/mL
benzonase. The resuspended material was sonicated and dialyzed overnight
against 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.075% octyl-h-glucoside.
The product was filtered through a 0.45-Am filter (Nalgene), loaded onto an
FPLC Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia), and eluted with sodium
chloride (gradient 0–1.0 mol/L). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The
flow-through fraction, containing EMAP-II, was loaded onto a Source 15
reverse-phase column (Pharmacia) and eluted with acetonitrile (gradient 5–
95%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing EMAP-II
were neutralized by adding 5 N sodium hydroxide, pooled, and partially
dried with a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. The product was then
loaded onto a Shodex gel-filtration column (Phenomenex) and eluted with
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.075% octyl-h-glucoside. Fractions
containing EMAP-II were pooled and filtered through a 0.22-Am filter

www.aacrjournals.org

(Nalgene). The final product was aliquoted and stored at 80jC. All
solutions used in the chromatographic steps were prepared with sterile and
endotoxin-free water (SALF Laboratorio Farmacologico SpA). Protein
concentration was measured with the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce
Chemical Co.). The endotoxin content of EMAP-II, measured using the
quantitative chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (BioWhittaker,
Inc.), was 0.002 units/Ag.
In vivo studies. Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute and done according to the
prescribed guidelines.
C57BL6/N or C57BL6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 18 to
20 g were challenged with s.c. injection in the left flank of 7  104 RMA wt
cells or 200  104 B16F1 cells, respectively; 9 to 11 days later, mice were
treated with EMAP-II or NGR-TNF solutions, alone or in combination, at
various doses. All drugs were diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride containing
100 Ag/mL endotoxin-free human serum albumin (Farma-Biagini SpA) and
administered i.p. Tumor growth was monitored daily by measuring the
tumors with calipers. Animals were sacrificed before the tumors reached
1.5 cm in diameter. Tumor sizes are shown as mean F SE ( five animals
per group).
Detection of apoptotic cells by immunofluorescence. Cell apoptosis
in tumor tissue sections was analyzed by immunofluorescence as follows:
16 days after tumor cell implantation, tumor-bearing mice were treated
i.p. with EMAP-II and NGR-TNF, alone or in combination. Two, eight, or
twenty-four hours later, mice were sacrificed and tumors were embedded
in Killik frozen section medium (Bio-Optica) for quick freezing. Cryostatic
sections, 6 Am thick, were prepared, adsorbed on polylysine-coated slides,
fixed for 30 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and frozen at
80jC. Detection of apoptotic and endothelial cells was done as follows:
tissue sections were incubated with 150 AL of PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-BT), and 5% normal goat serum
for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was then removed and replaced
with PBS-BT containing anti-CD31 mAb MEC-13.3 (1:100), anti–cleaved
caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (1:100), and 2% normal goat serum. After
incubation for 1 h at room temperature, each tissue section was rinsed for
15 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and further incubated for 1
h with AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) antibody and
AlexaFluor 546 goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) antibody (Invitrogen), both
diluted 1:500 in PBS-BT. The slides were rinsed again and incubated for 5
min with PBS containing 0.1 Ag/mL DAPI (Sigma) to stain cell nuclei.
Sections were analyzed with an Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss,
equipped with 40/0.75 and 63/1.4 objective lenses and AxioVision
acquisition software).
Three sections per tumor (obtained from three different regions) were
analyzed. The quantification of apoptotic tumor cells in each section was
done as follows: a score ranging from 0 to 4 was given to 10 fields (random)
of each section, depending on the percentage of apoptotic tumor cells: 0
(0%), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), and 4 (76–100%).
Similarly, quantification of apoptotic endothelial cells was done on three
sections per tumor and by inspecting the entire sections; a score ranging
from 0 to 4 was given to each section depending on the number of vessels
containing apoptotic endothelial cells (CD31/caspase-3 double positive): 0
(0 vessels), 1 (1–10 vessels), 2 (11–20 vessels), 3 (21–30 vessels), and 4 (>30
vessels).

Results
Production and characterization of murine recombinant
EMAP-II. Mature murine EMAP-II is a 166-residue-long protein
derived from a 310-residue precursor (proEMAP; ref. 11).
Recombinant murine EMAP-II was produced by expressing the
cDNA coding for residues 145 to 310 of proEMAP in E. coli cells
and purified from cell extracts by ion-exchange, reverse-phase,
and gel-filtration chromatography. The final product was
homogeneous by analytical gel-filtration chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing

conditions, and Western blot analysis with an anti–EMAP-II
antibody, the latter showing single bands of f18 kDa (Supplementary Fig. S1A–D). The molecular mass of the purified product
was 17,988.5 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry. This value
corresponds very well to the mass expected for mature murine
EMAP-II (17,989.94 Da).
Low-dose, but not high-dose, EMAP-II increases the antitumor activity of NGR-TNF in murine lymphoma and
melanoma models. We examined, first, the antitumor activity of
EMAP-II and NGR-TNF, alone and in combination, against murine
RMA lymphomas transplanted in immunocompetent C57BL6
syngeneic mice. A single administration of EMAP-II or NGR-TNF
(0.1 ng, i.p., alone) induced a modest delay in RMA tumor growth
(Fig. 1A, left). No antitumor effects were observed when the dose of
EMAP-II was increased to 5,000 ng (Fig. 1B, middle). When mice
were treated with a combination of EMAP-II (0.01 or 0.1 ng) and
NGR-TNF (0.1 ng, 0.5 h later), we observed significant antitumor
effects, pointing to synergistic mechanisms (Fig. 1A, middle and
right). The synergism was progressively lost when the dose of
EMAP-II was increased to 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 ng, the latter dose

being completely inactive (Fig. 1A, right). The plot of tumor volume
versus dose of EMAP-II showed a bell-shaped dose-response curve,
maximal antitumor effects being achieved with 0.1 ng of EMAP-II
in combination with 0.1 ng of NGR-TNF (Fig. 1C). Thus, EMAP-II
and NGR-TNF exerted synergistic effects only when very low doses
of both cytokines were used. No synergistic effects were observed
when EMAP-II was digested with trypsin (data not shown).
Furthermore, no loss of body weight was observed after
administration of EMAP-II/NGR-TNF, suggesting that anticancer
effects were induced without causing major toxicity (not shown).
In the attempt to optimize the administration schedule, we
treated mice with both cytokines with intervals of 0.5, 2, and
16 h between drug administrations. Optimal effects were obtained
when NGR-TNF was administered 0.5 h after low-dose EMAP-II
(Fig. 1B, left) or when the two drugs were given together (not
shown). In contrast, lack of synergism was observed when NGRTNF was given 16 h after low-dose or high-dose EMAP-II (Fig. 1B,
left and middle). Noteworthy, in the latter case, we observed
complete inhibition of NGR-TNF effects (Fig. 1B, middle). This
pretreatment inhibited also the NGR-TNF/cisplatin synergism

alone or in combination. The number of apoptotic cells was analyzed 24 h later in tumor tissue sections (3 tumors, 3 sections per tumor, 10 fields per section, total
of 90 fields per treatment) after immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 (green ); cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue ); a score ranging from 0 to 4 was given to
10 random fields of each section, depending on the amount of apoptotic cells (green ; see Materials and Methods). A, columns, mean apoptotic score (90 fields

(Fig. 1B, right), further supporting the concept that high-dose
EMAP-II inhibits, rather than potentiates, NGR-TNF.
To investigate the role of the NGR domain in the ‘‘low-dose
EMAP-II/NGR-TNF’’ synergism, we carried out similar studies using
EMAP-II in combination with nontargeted TNF. In this case, no
antitumor effects were observed (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the NGR
domain is crucial for activity, likely for targeting TNF to the tumor
vasculature.
Similar experiments were done using the syngeneic B16F1
melanoma model. Also in this case, high-dose EMAP-II (1,000 ng)
was unable to potentiate the antitumor activity of NGR-TNF
against B16F1 melanomas. In contrast, 40% to 50% reduction of
tumor growth rate was observed when low-dose EMAP-II (0.1 ng)
was given before NGR-TNF (not shown). Immunohistochemical
analysis of several tumor tissue sections with anti–cleaved
caspase-3 antibodies showed marked increase of tumor cell
apoptosis 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2A and B). Similar effects
on tumor cell apoptosis were observed also with the RMA model
(not shown).
Low-dose EMAP-II/NGR-TNF combination induces endothelial cell apoptosis and decreases tumor vascular density. The
mechanism of action underlying the massive apoptosis of tumor
cells after treatment with low-dose EMAP-II/NGR-TNF was then
investigated. Cytotoxicity assays with cultured RMA cells showed

www.aacrjournals.org

that this cell line is resistant in vitro to EMAP-II/NGR-TNF
treatment over a wide range of concentrations and ratios
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similar results were obtained also with
B16F1 melanoma cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting
that the in vivo apoptotic effect was indirect. To assess the original
hypothesis of vascular damage as a primary antitumor mechanism,
we measured the number of apoptotic endothelial cells in RMA
tumors by immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CD31 (an
endothelial cell marker) and anti–activated caspase-3 (a marker
of apoptosis) antibodies. We observed a significant increase of
apoptotic endothelial cells 8 h after treatment with EMAP-II/NGRTNF (low-dose) and, apparently, a decrease after 24 h (Fig. 3A, top).
At variance, the number of apoptotic tumor cells (CD31 negative/
caspase-3 positive cells) was maximal after 24 h [Fig. 3A (bottom)
and B], suggesting that endothelial cell apoptosis preceded tumor
cell apoptosis. Of note, control treatments with cytokines alone
showed that NGR-TNF, but not EMAP-II, could induce endothelial
cell apoptosis, although to a lower extent compared with the
combined treatment, at least after 8 h (Fig. 3A and B). The lower
number of double-positive cells observed 24 h after the treatment
with the drug combination, compared with NGR-TNF alone, likely
reflected a marked loss of CD31 in late apoptotic cells, due to
stronger antivascular effects. A significant reduction of CD31positive vessels, 24 h after treatment with EMAP-II/NGR-TNF, was

observed also in the B16F1 melanoma model, compared with single
agents (Fig. 4). These results strongly suggest that the combined
treatment led to reduction of vascular density more efficiently than
single agents and support the original hypothesis of vascular
targeting and damage.

were immunostained with anti-CD31 mAb (red) and anti–cleaved caspase-3

To investigate the mechanism of endothelial cell apoptosis
observed in vivo and to assess whether other factors, besides
EMAP-II/NGR-TNF, are necessary for cell killing, we carried out
in vitro cytotoxicity assays with cultured HUVEC and HMEC-1
endothelial cells. These cells were incubated with various
concentrations of EMAP-II and NGR-TNF in the range of picogram
to microgram per milliliter. After 60 h, viable cells were quantified
by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. These drugs, either alone or in combination, could
not induce cytotoxic effects (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D),
suggesting that other factors present in the tumor microenvironment were likely critical for the in vivo activity.
NGR-TNF/TNF-R1 interactions are sufficient for the synergism with EMAP-II in vivo. It is well known that TNF exerts
its biological functions by interacting with two membrane
receptors of 55 kDa (TNF-R1) and 75 kDa (TNF-R2). To assess
the role of TNF receptors in the synergistic effect of EMAP-II/NGRTNF on cell apoptosis, we next examined the effect of this
combination in the RMA model using human NGR-TNF in place of
murine NGR-TNF. This experiment takes advantage of the fact that
human TNF binds only TNF-R1 because binding to murine TNF-R2
is species specific (24).
Microscopic analysis of several tumor tissue sections showed
that the combination of EMAP-II (0.1 ng)/human NGR-TNF
(0.3 ng) is sufficient to induce marked apoptosis of tumor cells
(Fig. 5). These results suggest that TNF-R1 is primarily involved in
the proapoptotic mechanism of EMAP-II/NGR-TNF combination.
Of note, a lower number of apoptotic cells was observed when
the same study was done with a 10-fold higher amount of EMAP-II
(1 ng; Fig. 5).
High-dose EMAP-II induces soluble TNF-R1 shedding in
circulation. Shedding of soluble TNF receptors is an efficient
counter-regulatory mechanism of TNF (21). To assess whether this
mechanism was responsible for the loss of synergism with highdose EMAP-II, we have analyzed the circulating levels of soluble
TNF-R1 (sTNF-R1) and soluble TNF-R2 (sTNF-R2) in tumor-bearing
mice before and 30 min after treatment with 0.1, 1, and 1,000 ng of
EMAP-II. Whereas 0.1 ng of EMAP-II could not affect the
circulating levels of soluble receptors, a significant increase,
particularly of sTNF-R1, was induced by higher doses (Fig. 6A).
This mechanism could contribute to NGR-TNF inhibition observed
after administration of high-dose EMAP-II. Of note, whereas 1-ng
EMAP-II could induce a significative increase in the circulating
levels of sTNF-R1, the same dose could still induce significant
antitumor effects, although to a lower extent (Fig. 1A, right). This
suggests that other mechanisms contribute, together with soluble
TNF receptor shedding, to the complete inhibition of NGR-TNF
when this cytokine was combined with 1 Ag of EMAP-II.
To assess whether endothelial cell activation by EMAP-II can
directly cause the release of soluble TNF receptors, we carried out
in vitro studies with cultured HUVEC cells. Neither NGR-TNF nor
EMAP-II, alone or in combination, could affect soluble TNF
receptor shedding in the supernatant of these cells over a wide
range of concentrations (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, EMAP-II could not
affect the shedding of soluble TNF receptors induced by NGR-TNF
in the SV40 immortalized HMEC-1 cells (Fig. 6C). These results
suggest that sTNF-R1 shedding induced by EMAP-II in mice is
unlikely related to direct effects of EMAP-II on endothelial cells.
More likely, other cells were activated by high-dose EMAP-II in vivo
to release sTNF-R1 in circulation, or other factors possibly present
in the tumor microenvironment were necessary.

Inhibition of Tumor Growth by EMAP-II and NGR-TNF

behavior? In previous work, we have shown that sTNF-R2 shedding
is an efficient counter-regulatory mechanism of NGR-TNF, either
alone or in combination with chemotherapy (21). When we
measured serum soluble TNF receptors after administration of
increasing doses of EMAP-II, we observed a significant increase of
sTNF-R1. Given that small changes in soluble TNF receptor levels
are sufficient to significantly inhibit TNF (25–27), this mechanism
could have contributed to NGR-TNF inhibition when we used highdose EMAP-II.
The results of previous studies showing that local injection of
high-dose EMAP-II (10 Ag) into murine mammary adenocarcinoma
can increase tumor sensitivity to high-dose TNF (5 Ag; ref. 11) are
not necessarily in contrast with this view because, in this case,
circulating levels of TNF were likely to exceed the buffering
capacity of soluble TNF receptors, leaving a fraction of molecules
able to interact with membrane receptors on vessels. However, for
the same reason, one might expect that also the undesired systemic
effects of TNF are not blocked as well, leading to systemic toxicity.

Discussion
Despite TNF sensitization of tumor blood vessels by EMAP-II
being a well-known phenomenon, systemic administration of high,
biologically relevant doses of EMAP-II and TNF cannot be used for
cancer treatment because of toxicity. The main finding of this work
is that this limitation can be overcome by combining a TNF
targeting strategy (NGR-TNF) with the use of ultra low-dose EMAPII. In particular, we have found that 0.1 ng of EMAP-II and 0.1 ng of
NGR-TNF can exert synergistic antitumor effects, with no evidence
of toxicity, in two murine tumor models poorly sensitive to TNF.
Maximal synergism, leading to endothelial cell damage, tumor cell
apoptosis, and tumor growth inhibition, was achieved when EMAPII was given to mice 0.5 h before NGR-TNF.
Remarkably, nontargeted TNF could not synergize with low-dose
EMAP-II. The simplest explanation for this observation is that lowdose TNF could not reach local concentrations in tumor vessels to
induce antivascular effects, whereas NGR-TNF could reach
bioactive concentrations and activate membrane receptors by
virtue of a targeting mechanism (21). However, no synergism was
observed even when high-dose TNF (5 Ag) was combined with
0.1 ng of EMAP-II (data not shown). One possibility is that the
NGR domain of NGR-TNF plays additional roles besides targeting
TNF to CD13-positive endothelial cells, such as signaling. However,
whether the NGR domain contributes to the synergism by
activating membrane receptors still remains to be clarified.
Unexpectedly, the synergism was completely lost, and even
reverted to inhibition of NGR-TNF activity, when higher doses of
EMAP-II (1–5 Ag) were administered to tumor-bearing mice. In
addition, the NGR-TNF/chemotherapy synergism was inhibited by
high-dose EMAP-II. What is the mechanism of this paradoxical

caspase-3. Microscopy photographs show CD31 (red) and activated

Figure 6. Induction of sTNF-R1 and
sTNF-R2 shedding in the blood of
RMA tumor–bearing mice and in the
supernatants of primary and immortalized
endothelial cells after treatment with EMAP-II
and NGR-TNF. A, animals were treated 11 d
after tumor implantation with 0.1, 1,
or 1,000 ng of EMAP-II (n = 3). Blood
samples were taken from the tail vein before
and 30 min after the treatment. B and C,
HUVEC and HMEC-1 were seeded in
microtiter plates (1.87  105/cm2 and 2.5 
105/cm2, respectively). After overnight
incubation, the cells were cultured for 48 h
in the absence or presence of EMAP-II and
NGR-TNF. sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 in sera
and cell supernatants were measured by
ELISA using the Mouse sTNF RI/TNFRSF1A
and sTNF RII/TNFRSF1B Quantikine ELISA
Kits (R&D Systems). *, P < 0.05 (two-tailed
t test).

The results of in vitro experiments with cultured human primary
and immortalized endothelial cells showed that EMAP-II does not
induce soluble TNF receptor shedding from these cells over a wide
range of concentrations. No EMAP-II–dependent induction of
soluble TNF receptors was observed even when cells were cultured
with EMAP-II/NGR-TNF. These observations argue against the
hypothesis that the endothelial lining of vessels is the source of
EMAP-II–induced sTNF-R1 in vivo, and suggest that other cells in
the body produce sTNF-R1 after EMAP-II administration. However,
although previous work showed that murine EMAP-II can affect
human endothelial cells (11), we cannot exclude that species
differences could also account for the lack of soluble TNF receptor
induction or that other factors present in the tumor microenvironment are necessary.
With regard to the mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis, it is
unlikely that the massive apoptotic effect observed after
treatment with low-dose EMAP-II/NGR-TNF was due to direct

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

interaction of these cytokines with tumor cells. More likely, it was
a consequence of vascular damage. Indeed, considering that the
total number of NGR-TNF or EMAP-II molecules injected in mice
was f109 and that only a fraction of them could reach the tumor
(thus a number of molecules lower than the total number of cells
present in f1-cm3 tumors), the effect was likely indirect (e.g.,
involving the endothelial compartments of the tumor, which
represents a small fraction of the tumor mass). Accordingly, the
results of studies on antitumor mechanisms have shown that the
combination of low-dose EMAP-II and NGR-TNF can induce
apoptosis of endothelial cells in vivo apparently before that of
tumor cells. This suggests that tumor cell apoptosis is a consequence of vascular damage.
We also observed that human NGR-TNF could efficiently
induce apoptotic effects in tumors when combined with EMAP-II,
similarly to murine NGR-TNF. Given that human TNF can bind
murine TNF-R1, but not murine TNF-R2 (24), this observation

suggests that NGR-TNF interaction with TNF-R1 is sufficient for
the synergism. Interestingly, previous work has shown that EMAP-II
up-regulates TNF-R1 mRNA expression in endothelial cells (28).
Furthermore, a recent study showed that EMAP-II induces TNF-R1
redistribution from Golgi storage pools to cell membrane and
facilitates TNF-R1 apoptotic signaling in endothelial cells via TNF
receptor 1–associated death domain mobilization (29). However,
EMAP-II can exert a variety of other effects on endothelial cells and
monocytes potentially leading to activation and secretion of various
factors (11). It is therefore possible that tumor cell apoptosis is the
result not only of vascular damage and deprivation of oxygen and
nutrients but also of the release of a cascade of secondary mediators
that in turn affect tumor cell viability.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of lowdose NGR-TNF with low-dose EMAP-II is a novel strategy for

avoiding counter-regulatory as well as toxic reactions. This concept
is probably more general and provides a new rationale for liganddirected targeted delivery of low-dose cytokines to tumors.
Administration of ultra-low doses of cytokines that affect tumor
blood vessels could represent a novel concept in cancer therapy.
