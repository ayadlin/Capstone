Abstract
Tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNA) provide a new opportunity to treat cancer. This approach, “miRNA
replacement therapy,” is based on the concept that the reintroduction of miRNAs depleted in cancer cells
reactivates cellular pathways that drive a therapeutic response. Here, we describe the development of a therapeutic formulation using chemically synthesized miR-34a and a lipid-based delivery vehicle that blocks tumor
growth in mouse models of non–small-cell lung cancer. This formulation is effective when administered locally
or systemically. The antioncogenic effects are accompanied by an accumulation of miR-34a in the tumor tissue
and downregulation of direct miR-34a targets. Intravenous delivery of formulated miR-34a does not induce an
elevation of cytokines or liver and kidney enzymes in serum, suggesting that the formulation is well tolerated
and does not induce an immune response. The data provide proof of concept for the systemic delivery of a
synthetic tumor suppressor mimic, obviating obstacles associated with viral-based miRNA delivery and facilitating a rapid route for miRNA replacement therapy into the clinic. Cancer Res; 70(14); 5923–30. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding, naturally occurring RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally modulate
gene expression and determine cell fate by regulating multiple gene products and cellular pathways (1). Misregulation of
miRNAs is often a dire cellular event that can contribute to
the development of human diseases including cancer (2, 3).
miRNAs deregulated in cancer target multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and have therefore the potential of becoming powerful therapeutic agents (4, 5). Among the miRNAs
expressed at reduced levels in various human cancer types
is miR-34a (6–11). miR-34a is a member of the miR-34 family,
which is composed of miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c. The
miR-34a gene is located on chromosome 1p36.22 in a region
that has previously been associated with various cancers including lung cancer (12). In addition, frequent hypermethylation of the miR-34a promoter is another mechanism that can
lead to reduced miR-34a expression in lung cancer and other
cancer types (7, 11). miR-34a is transcriptionally induced by
the tumor suppressor p53 (6, 13–16), and low miR-34a expression levels correlate with a high probability of relapse
in non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (11). Overexpression of miR-34a inhibits the growth of cultured cancer

cells and affects gene products that promote cell cycle progression and counteract apoptosis (6, 13–16). miR-34a also
inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer stem cells (17).
Thus, miR-34a displays an antiproliferative phenotype in numerous cancer cell types (6, 13–16). However, the antioncogenic activity of miR-34a in vivo and its potential as a
therapeutic remain unknown. Here, we show the tumor suppressor function of miR-34a in vivo and evaluate the therapeutic activity of a synthetic miR-34a mimic in an effort to
restore a loss of function in cancer.

Materials and Methods
Human tissue samples, cell lines, and oligos
Thirteen flash-frozen NSCLC tumor samples and corresponding
normal adjacent tissues (NAT) were purchased from ProteoGenex; five flash-frozen tissue pairs were purchased from the
National Disease Research Interchange. All 14 formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tumor samples and NATs
were acquired from Phylogeny/Folio Biosciences. All lung cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and cultured according to the vendor's instructions: A549, BJ, NCI-H460, Calu-3, NCI-H596, NCI-H1650,
HCC2935, SW-900, NCI-H226, NCI-H522, NCI-H1299, Wi-38,
and TE353.sk. Primary T cells were obtained from Atlanta
Pharmaceuticals. Transfection and proliferation assays were
carried out as described (18, 19), and proliferation was assessed using Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) 3 to 7 days after transfection depending on the growth rates of individual cell lines.
Cellular viability was determined using Neutral Red from
Sigma-Aldrich following the manufacturer's instructions. For
colony formation assays, 5 × 106 cells were electroporated with
1.6 μmol/L miRNA in 200 μL of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) using

the Bio-Rad GenePulserXcell instrument, and 3,000 cells were
seeded on 100-mm dishes. After 32 days, colonies were stained
with 2% crystal violet and colonies containing >50 cells were
counted. Synthetic miRNAs and siRNAs were obtained from
Ambion, Applied Biosystems and Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA from flash-frozen NSCLC tumors and normal
adjacent tissues, as well as human lung cancer cells and tumor xenografts, was isolated using the mirVANA PARIS RNA
isolation kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from FFPE tissues was isolated using
the RecoverAll Kit from Ambion. For quantitative real-time
PCR (RT-PCR) detection of the miR-34a oligonucleotide,
10 ng of total RNA and miR-34a–specific RT-primers [assay
ID 000426, TaqMan miRNA Assay, Applied Biosystems
(ABI)] were heat-denatured at 70°C for 2 minutes and reversetranscribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). The housekeeping miRNAs miR-191
and miR-103 (ABI assay IDs 002299 and 000439) were amplified as internal references (20) to adjust for well-to-well RNA
input variances. For detection of mouse IFIT1 mRNA levels in
mouse lung tissue, cDNA was generated by random decamers
(Ambion) using 10 ng of total RNA under the conditions described above and amplified using a TaqMan Gene Expression
Assay (ABI assay ID Mm00515153_m1). Raw CT values were
normalized to the values of murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Integrated DNA Technologies) to
correct for equal input of RNA. For detection of human
TP53, p21WAF1/CIP1, and MDM2 in NSCLC tissues, cDNA was
generated by random decamers using 500 ng of total RNA
under the conditions described above and amplified using
the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays Hs99999147_m1 (TP53),
Hs00355782_m1 (p21), and Hs99999008_m1 (MDM2). Raw Ct
values were normalized to the geometric mean of PPIA (amplified using ABI assay Hs99999904_m1), GAPDH (amplified using
ABI assay Hs99999905_m1), and 18S (amplified using ABI assay
Hs99999901_s1). All gene expression levels were determined
by real-time PCR using Platinum Taq Polymerase reagents
(Invitrogen) and the ABI Prism 7900 SDS instrument (Applied
Biosystems).
Lung cancer xenografts
All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with currently prescribed guidelines and under a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at BIOO Scientific Corporation. H460 and A549 NSCLC
cells were collected, counted, and mixed with Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) in a 1:1 ratio by volume. Cells (3 × 106) in 100 μL
of medium/Matrigel solution were injected s.c. in the lower
back region of female nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice (The Jackson Laboratory).
Tumor volumes were determined as previously described
(18). miRNA (100 or 20 μg) was formulated with MaxSuppressor in vivo RNALancerII, a lipid-based delivery reagent (BIOO
Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Formulated miRNA was administered intratumorally (i.t.)
or intravenously (i.v.) by tail vein injections once tumors

reached a volume of 150 to 200 mm3. Tumors and organs were
collected, split, and placed in either 10% formalin for histology
or homogenized in 1× denaturing solution (Ambion) for RNA
isolation.
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry
Tumor tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in
paraffin using the Microm Tissue Embedding Center (Labequip, Ltd.). Sections (5 μm) were cut and stained with
H&E. For immunohistochemical staining, sections were deparaffinized and hydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 in water for 10 minutes.
Antigen retrieval was done with 10 mmol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 10 minutes in a microwave oven followed by a
20-minute cooldown and thorough washing in TBS with Tween
20 [TTBS; 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.1% Tween 20]. Slides were incubated with Biocare blocking
reagent (with casein in the buffer; Biocare Medical) for
10 minutes to block nonspecific binding. Slides were incubated
with various primary antibodies directed against ki67 (DAKO),
caspase-3 (R&D Systems), c-Met, cyclin-dependent kinase 4
(CDK4), and Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Slides were washed in TTBS twice
and then incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or goat
anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) at 1:500 dilution for
30 minutes at room temperature. After washing, slides were
incubated with antigoat horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies (BioGenex) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washed. Finally, slides were incubated with
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (BioGenex Laboratories) and color development was closely monitored under a microscope. Slides
were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Cytokines and blood chemistries
Female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were
injected i.v. in a lateral tail vein with 100 μg of miRNA
formulated with MaxSuppressor in vivo RNALancerII. As a
positive control for cytokine induction, a group of animals
were injected with 20 μg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from
Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane using a Laboratory Animal Anesthesia
System (VetEquip) and blood was collected via cardiac stick
at set time points after injection into a serum separator
tube for serum isolation or into an EDTA tube (Sarstedt) for
whole blood chemistry analysis. Serum cytokine levels were
determined using a mouse Fluorokine Multianalyte Profiling
Kit (R&D Systems) and the Luminex 100 IS instrument.
For blood chemistry analysis, whole blood was sent to the
Comparative Pathology Laboratory at UC Davis.

Results
miR-34a is suppressed in human NSCLC tissues
To assess the expression levels of miR-34a in patients with
NSCLC, we have tested a cohort of 18 human tumor samples
that were flash-frozen after biopsy and a cohort of 14 tumor
samples that were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) before RNA isolation. The sample collection was

composed of the predominant histotypes of NSCLC, including 9 adenocarcinoma, 17 squamous cell carcinoma, 4 large
cell carcinoma, and 2 bronchioalveolar carcinoma (Supplementary Table S1). Expression levels in the tumor tissue were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and compared with the levels
in the corresponding NATs (Fig. 1). Of the 32 tumor samples,
20 (63%) showed reduced miR-34a expression with an average
expression level that is 60% of the expression observed in the
corresponding normal adjacent lung samples. Reduced miR34a was observed in all histotypes of NSCLC, in agreement
with other reports showing downregulation of miR-34a in a
broad range of tumor types including lung cancer (6, 7, 11).
Tumor levels of miR-34a did not correlate with disease stage
(Supplementary Table S1). Similar to tumor tissues, established NSCLC cell lines frequently showed a reduction in
miR-34a levels (Fig. 1). The ones devoid of miR-34a expression
carry mutations in the p53 gene (H1299, H522, H596, Calu-3,
and SW-900; refs. 21, 22) in accord with previous data showing
that miR-34a is a transcriptional target of p53 (6, 13–16).
To correlate miR-34a expression levels with the transcriptional activity of p53 in human tumors, we determined the
mRNA levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2, both of which are
transcriptionally induced by p53 and have previously been
used as a measure for p53 activity (23–25). Thus, reduced
p53 activity could be reflected by reduced levels of MDM2
and p21WAF1/CIP1 in the tumor tissue relative to NAT. However, other factors potentially contributing to the expression
levels of these targets must be considered. The analysis was
limited to 15 RNA samples generated from flash-frozen tissues, as RNA from FFPE samples does not exert RNA qualities that are sufficient to assess mRNA levels. Although no
significant correlation was observed between p53 activity
and miR-34a levels (R2p21/miR-34a = 0.2094, R2MDM2/miR-34a =
0.1495), all tumors with reduced miR-34a expression also

showed reduced mRNA levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2
(Supplementary Table S1). Similar results on p53 mutation
status and miR-34a levels in NSCLC have been reported by
Gallardo and colleagues (11). As anticipated, p53 mRNA
levels did not correlate with those of its targets (R2p53/p21 =
0.0392, R2p53/MDM2 = 0.0692), in agreement with the observation that p53 levels are not indicative of its functional status
(Supplementary Table S1; refs. 25–27).
miR-34a inhibits the growth of cultured
lung cancer cells
The data suggest that suppression of miR-34a might be
critical in acquiring a malignant phenotype and that reintroduction of miR-34a may interfere with the oncogenic properties of NSCLC cells. To test this possibility, we transiently
transfected a panel of NSCLC cell lines with miR-34a and
measured proliferation after 72 hours. The human NSCLC
cell lines chosen vary in histology and cancer genotype and
therefore allow an evaluation of miR-34a–induced effects in a
genetically diverse set of NSCLC (22). As a control, cancer
cells were transfected separately with a negative control
miR-NA (miR-NC) that contains a scrambled sequence and
does not specifically target any human gene products (Ambion).
As an indication for successful transfection and extent of
growth inhibition, cells were transfected with an siRNA
directed against the spindle protein kinesin 11 (EG5; Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 28). As shown in Fig. 2A, most cancer
cell lines exhibited reduced cell growth in the presence of
miR-34a. The degree of growth inhibition is similar to those
of other lung cancer–directed therapies in transient cell
assays (29). Cells transfected with miR-34a showed signs
of stress as evidenced by a loss of the spindle-like shape
followed by either rounding and detachment or a large,
flat senescence-like phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S2).

lines were compared with the expression value in Wi-38 normal lung fibroblasts (100%). FF, flash-frozen; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded;

The population doublings were

lines carrying mutated p53 include
Calu-3, H596, H1299, H522, and
SW-900 (21, 22). A549 and H460
carry wild-type p53 (21, 22).

Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of exogenous miR-34a
were not limited to cell lines with reduced endogenous
miR-34a expression and also affected cell lines with normal
miR-34a expression levels (e.g., H226 cells; Fig. 1). Inhibition
of cancer cell growth by miR-34a was also independent of
p53 status (Fig. 2A). A colony formation assay using SW900 cells carrying mutated p53 further shows the ability of
miR-34a to inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells in the
absence of functional p53 (Fig. 2B). Colony formation of
cells transfected with miR-34a was merely 9% relative to cells
transfected with miR-NC (100%) 32 days after transfection.
SW-900 cells proliferate considerably slower than most other
NSCLC cells, and therefore, we speculate that the miR-34a
mimic is less rapidly subject to dilution due to ongoing cell
divisions compared with fast-dividing cells, which might
explain the extended duration of miR-34a activity in SW-900
cells (30, 31). To study the long-term effects of miR-34a in
rapidly dividing cells, we serially transfected miR-34a into
H226 lung cancer cells, a cell line that moderately responded
to miR-34a in transient transfection experiments. Cell counts
were taken during the experiment and extrapolated to

calculate population doublings and final cell numbers.
miR-NC–treated cells showed normal exponential growth
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, miR-34a severely retarded H226
cancer cell proliferation. To assess whether the inhibitory
effects of miR-34a were specific to cancer cells, we measured
the proliferation effects of miR-34a in nonmalignant cell
lines including normal Wi-38 lung fibroblasts. In contrast to
cancer cells, transient transfection of miR-34a into nonmalignant cell lines had no effect on their ability to proliferate
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Similarly, a direct comparison of
the cellular viability of A549 lung cancer cells versus normal
BJ cells in response to increasing miR-34a concentrations indicated that normal cells are more refractory to miR-34a than
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In summary, the data
suggest that miR-34a exerts an antireplicative function in a
broad range of lung cancer cells.

miR-34a could block lung tumor growth in the animal. Naked

Activity of a Synthetic Tumor Suppressor microRNA

miRNA oligonucleotides are rapidly degraded in biofluids,
and therefore, we formulated the miRNA in a lipid-based
delivery vehicle that is designed for systemic delivery
of the oligonucleotide to various tissues (Materials and
Methods). Because the range of an effective systemically
administered miRNA dose and the rate of successful delivery
to the tumor tissue were unknown, we first evaluated the
miR-34a–induced effects of i.t. injections using 100 μg of oligo, which corresponds to a relative concentration sufficient
to induce growth inhibitory effects in cultured cancer cells.
H460 NSCLC cells, a fast-growing tumor xenograft that yields
large tumors within 3 weeks after implantation, were grafted
s.c. into the lower back of NOD/SCID mice and grown until
palpable tumors formed. On day 12 after xenograft implantation, a group of tumor-bearing mice received i.t. injections of
formulated miR-34a. Local injections were repeated on days
15 and 18 to maintain increased levels of miR-34a in the
tumor tissue. As controls, a separate group of animals were
injected i.t. with PBS, the vehicle only, or vehicle formulated
with miR-NC. As shown in Fig. 3A, tumors injected with formulated miR-NC were unaffected and developed at a pace
similar to those that received PBS or vehicle. In contrast,
i.t. injections of formulated miR-34a prevented the outgrowth
of viable tumors. A histologic analysis revealed that miR-34a–
treated tumors contained large areas filled with cell debris
(Fig. 3B). The few seemingly viable tumor cells that remained
preferentially in the periphery of the tumor showed reduced
expression of ki67 and an increase in caspase-3, indicating
that miR-34a actively inhibits proliferation and stimulates
the apoptotic cascade in H460 tumor cells. To better correlate the activity of miR-34a, we measured the protein levels of
endogenous CDK4 and c-Met, both of which are directly
repressed by miR-34a (13). Tumors treated with miR-34a
lacked the expression of CDK4 and c-Met relative to tumors
that received miR-NC (Fig. 3C). Similarly, Bcl-2, another

direct target of miR-34a (6), was repressed in tumors that
received formulated miR-34a (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
downregulation of CDK4, c-Met, and Bcl-2 demonstrates
the specific activity of miR-34a in H460 tumor cells; however, we assume that the regulation of other targets is
necessary to explain the complete miR-34a phenotype.
The expression of miR-34a targets inversely correlated with
∼100-fold increased miR-34a levels in the tumor tissue relative to endogenous miR-34a levels in H460 tumor cells
(Fig. 3D). The data suggest that local administration of formulated miR-34a induces a specific inhibitory effect in tumor cells with an accumulation of miR-34a and concurrent
repression of its direct target genes.
Systemic delivery of formulated miR-34a inhibits the
growth of established lung tumors in vivo
To evaluate the miR-34a–dependent effects on systemic
delivery of the miRNA, we repeated the experimental framework using the H460 xenograft. Animals carrying palpable
subcutaneous tumors were treated with formulated miR-34a,
miR-NC, or vehicle only. In contrast to the previous study,
however, formulations were administered by i.v. tail vein injections. Each dose contained 100 μg of formulated oligo, which
equals 5 mg/kg per mouse with an average weight of 20 g.
Similar to i.t. injections of miR-34a, repeated i.v. delivery of
formulated miR-34a specifically blocked tumor growth (Fig. 4A).
Tumor tissues from miR-34a–treated animals frequently
showed areas with cell debris, reduced expression of ki67,
and an increase in caspase-3 (Fig. 4B), in agreement with
the effects induced by local delivery of miRNA. Systemic
delivery of formulated miR-34a at 1 mg/kg also inhibited
the growth of established A549 NSCLC xenografts, further
showing the antitumor activity of miR-34a (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). The histology and immunohistochemical staining
of A549 tumors that received miR-34a resemble those of

Palpable subcutaneous H460 tumor xenografts were treated on days 12, 15, and 18 with each 100 μg of formulated miR-34a or miR-NC. As controls,
separate groups of tumor-bearing animals were injected with vehicle alone or PBS. Caliper measurements were taken on the days indicated and averaged.

treated H460 tumors, suggesting that repeated administration of a miR-34a mimic inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in A549 lung tumor cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Similar to local administration of miR-34a, the
growth inhibitory effects correlated with an accumulation
of miR-34a in the tumor tissue and repression of c-Met
and Bcl-2, as well as partial repression of CDK4 (Fig. 4C
and D). However, the overall abundance of systemically delivered miR-34a in the tumor tissue was substantially less
compared with locally delivered oligo and suggests that

only minimal amounts of miR-34a are needed to elicit a
therapeutic effect. Interestingly, the tumors with the greatest
suppression of miR-34a targets were also the ones with the
highest accumulation of miR-34a oligonucleotide.
Systemic delivery of formulated miR-34a does not lead
to elevated blood chemistries nor trigger an
immune response
To assess the safety profile of systemically delivered miR-34a,
we examined serum levels of alanine aminotransferase,

Activity of a Synthetic Tumor Suppressor microRNA

aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, alkaline
phosphatase, creatinine, and creatine kinase from mice
repeatedly treated with formulated miR-34a, miR-NC, or vehicle alone. As shown in Fig. 5A, the values of these blood chemistries, which would indicate toxicity in liver, kidney, and
heart, were within the reference range and suggested that
miRNA treatment was well tolerated. To determine whether
the antioncogenic effects of miR-34a are indeed a specific
consequence of the miRNA and not the result of a nonspecific
induction of the immune system, we measured serum cytokine levels in immunocompetent BALB/c mice (Fig. 5B). An
activation of the immune system has been reported previously
to be induced by other oligonucleotide-containing formulations that might, at least in part, contribute to the effects of
the therapeutic (32–35). Because a burst of cytokines usually
occurs within just a few hours after administration of the
stimulant, we evaluated cytokine levels 1 to 24 hours after
i.v. administration of formulated miRNA (36–38). As a positive
control, a group of mice were i.v. injected with a nonlethal
dose of 1 mg/kg LPS (39), which stimulated an induction of
interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and
IFN-γ (Fig. 5B). These LPS-treated mice also developed acute
signs of illness, such as hunched posture, ruffled coat, and labored movement, and fully recovered within 24 hours after injection. In contrast, formulated miR-34a, miR-NC, or the
vehicle control failed to induce an immune response as
evidenced by normal serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IFN-γ,
and TNF-α (Fig. 5B), as well as normal levels of IL-1β and
IL-5 (Supplementary Fig. S5) 1 to 24 hours after i.v. injection.
Similarly, mRNA levels of IFIT1, a gene induced by IFN-α, were
solely elevated in response to LPS (Supplementary Fig. S6).
IL-6, a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine, was slightly elevated 3 hours after injection of formulated miRNA; however,
relative to the LPS control, this increase was mild and insufficient to reflect an actual immune response.

Discussion
In summary, the data provide strong evidence for the
safe and effective therapeutic delivery of a synthetic miRNA
mimic. By reintroducing a tumor suppressor miRNA, miRNA
replacement therapy seeks to restore a loss of function in
cancer and to reactivate cellular pathways that drive a therapeutic response. As such, miRNA replacement therapy is
distinct from other therapeutic approaches that are directed
toward a gain of function, including kinase inhibitors,
siRNAs, and miRNA antagonists. We hypothesize that the
synthetic miR-34a mimic acts like a naturally occurring
miR-34a and that it affects all mRNAs that are inherently
regulated by endogenous miR-34a in normal cells for which
the proper miR-34a-target interactions have evolved over a
billion years. Of note, miR-34a inhibited tumor cells that

are devoid of functional p53, suggesting that pathways downstream of miR-34a are sufficient to block cancer cell growth.
miR-34a also inhibited tumor cells that showed normal levels
of endogenous miR-34a, indicating that the therapeutic
application of tumor suppressor miRNAs is not limited to
replacement. This broad antioncogenic activity might be
explained by the fact that miRNAs target multiple oncogenes
and oncogenic pathways that cancer cells frequently become
addicted to (2). Thus, the ability to affect multiple cancer
pathways seems to be a key benefit of therapeutic miRNA
mimics that act in accord with our current understanding
of cancer as a “pathway disease” that can only be successfully
treated when intervening with multiple cancer pathways
(40–42). Other examples that support the concept of miRNA
replacement therapy are provided by let-7, miR-16, and
miR-26a, all of which can function as tumor suppressors and
inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of cancer (18, 43, 44).
It is interesting to note that, although miRNAs affect a wide
spectrum of genes, administration of formulated miR-34a was
well tolerated. We speculate that uptake of miRNA mimics
has no effect on normal cells because pathways regulated by
the miRNA mimic are already activated by the endogenous
miRNA in these cells. This may also suggest that targeted delivery to tumor tissues will not be necessary. The synthetic
miRNA mimic is delivered systemically in a controllable formulation without the need for ectopic expression vectors
and, therefore, lacks many technical challenges associated
with conventional gene therapy. Although future studies are
needed to address long-term efficacy and safety in higher species, our data on miR-34a highlight the utility of synthetic miRNA mimics and support the development of this new class of
cancer therapeutics.
