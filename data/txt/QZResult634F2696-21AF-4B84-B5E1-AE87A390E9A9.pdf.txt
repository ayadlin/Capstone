BACKGROUND: NVP-AUY922 (AUY; Luminespib) with or without bortezomib showed preclinical activity against multiple myeloma
(MM) cells. This phase 1/1B study assessed NVP-AUY922 alone and with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
METHODS: Dose escalation was guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model. In phase 1, patients who progressed after
2 to 4 prior therapies received NVP-AUY922 intravenously once weekly. In phase 1B, patients who progressed after 2 or fewer prior
therapies received NVP-AUY922 plus bortezomib. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
NVP-AUY922. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received NVP-AUY922 monotherapy at doses of 8 to 70 mg/m2. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed (grade 3 blurred vision at 70 mg/m2); no MTD was reached. The recommended phase 2 dose was 70 mg/
m2. The most frequent drug-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea, nausea, and ocular toxicities. Grade 3/4 AEs were uncommon (<10%). Eight patients discontinued treatment because of AEs; 5 had ocular toxicities (45 mg/m2). The best response was stable disease in 66.7% of the patients. There were no partial or complete responses. Five patients received NVP-AUY922 (which was
started at 50 mg/m2) plus bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2). Three of these patients experienced DLT. No further dose escalation was performed; the MTD for NVP-AUY922 plus bortezomib was not established. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed disease stabilization with
NVP-AUY922 in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The MTD for NVP-AUY922 was not reached, but reversible ocular toxicity
has been reported at high dose levels. Bortezomib at the standard recommended dose plus NVP-AUY922 was not tolerated. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the outcome of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has significantly improved with the development of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors. However, the majority eventually relapse. Patients may
achieve subsequent responses with additional treatment regimens, but these responses are short-lived, and this necessitates
novel treatment options for MM.1,2
A promising target in MM is overexpressed heat shock protein 90 (HSP90).3 HSP90 is a molecular chaperone,
which in complex with cochaperones (eg, HSP70) plays an important role in the stabilization and activation of many key
oncogenic client proteins.4,5 These HSP90 client proteins are involved in oncogenic signal transduction, angiogenesis,
antiapoptosis, and metastasis6 and thereby contribute to the overall survival of cancer cells. In vitro data suggest that

anticancer activity is exerted by HSP90 inhibitors across a
wide range of cancers via the blocking of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways.7 NVP-AUY922 is a highly
potent isoxazole-based, nongeldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor that inhibits the adenosine triphosphatase activity of
HSP90.8,9 NVP-AUY922 has greater potency, reduced
hepatotoxicity, and lower dependence on DT-diaphorase8,9 than the first-generation HSP90 inhibitors.10,11
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is approved as initial
therapy and for the treatment of patients with relapsed
and refractory MM.12,13
The rationale for the combination of NVP-AUY922
and bortezomib clinically derives from preclinical evidence of activity of NVP-AUY922 alone14 and a positive
combination effect in MM cells.15 HSP90 is upregulated
in bortezomib-treated MM cells and potentially causes
cellular resistance to induce an unfolded protein response
by proteasome inhibition. This hypothesis is supported
by the previously observed synergistic clinical effects of
tanespimycin (a first-generation HSP90 inhibitor) with
bortezomib.16 The purpose of this phase 1/1B study was
to assess NVP-AUY922 alone and with bortezomib in
patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM who had
progressed after 2 to 4 prior antimyeloma regimens,
including at least bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide, were included in phase 1. Patients with relapsed or
refractory MM who progressed after 2 or fewer prior
antimyeloma regimens (excluding bortezomib or dexamethasone monotherapy) were eligible for phase 1B.
Induction therapy followed by any kind of stem cell
transplantation and/or maintenance therapy was considered to be regimen 1.
Other key inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of
active MM (according to the International Myeloma
Working Group criteria),17 suitability for treatment with
bortezomib (phase 1B), the presence of measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status  2.
Key exclusion criteria were unresolved diarrhea
 grade 2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), acute or chronic liver
disease, peripheral neuropathy > CTCAE grade 1 (phase
1B), impaired cardiac function or clinically significant
cardiac diseases, known disorders due to a deficiency in
bilirubin glucuronidation, a history of another malignancy within the past 5 years except for adequately treated
2186

basal cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
prior treatment with any HSP90 or histone deacetylase
inhibitor, and treatment with therapeutic doses of
coumarin-based anticoagulants. All patients provided
written informed consent.
Study Design and Treatment

This was an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter
study (NCT00708292). The study comprised a dose escalation part with NVP-AUY922 administered alone (phase
1) and NVP-AUY922 administered in combination with
bortezomib (phase 1B). The study and any amendments
were reviewed by the independent ethics committee or
institutional review board of each center. The study was
conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices
and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
In phase 1, NVP-AUY922 was administered intravenously via 1-hour infusions once weekly on days 1, 8, and
15 of a 21-day treatment cycle. An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) including escalation with
overdose control was employed to guide dose escalation to
obtain reliable estimates of toxicity.18,19 The starting dose
of NVP-AUY922 (8 mg/m2) was based on the results of a
phase 1 solid tumor study.19 In phase 1B, patients received
NVP-AUY922 (as described previously) 5 minutes after
the administration of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2) via intravenous injection. The dose of NVP-AUY922 in phase 1B
part was 1 dose level below the highest dose to satisfy
overdose control criteria or 1 dose level below the singleagent maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose adjustments
were permitted for patients who were unable to tolerate the
protocol-specified dosing schedule. The primary objective
of this study was to determine the MTD of NVP-AUY922
alone and with bortezomib. Secondary objectives included
an assessment of the preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic
profile, safety, and tolerability.
Patient Assessments

All adverse events (AEs) were recorded with CTCAE version 3.0. All patients were followed up for AEs and serious
adverse events (SAEs) 28 days after the last infusion dose
of NVP-AUY922. Pharmacokinetic parameters were
determined by noncompartmental analysis with
WinNonlin Pro (version 5.2). Efficacy was evaluated with
the criteria recommended by the American Society of Hematology and the US Food and Drug Administration2;
these criteria included an adaptation of the International
Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma by the
International Myeloma Working Group.17 To assess
changes in pharmacodynamic markers of target

[n 5 2], and initiation of a new cancer therapy [n 5 2]);
the remaining 12 patients (50.0%) completed treatment
until disease progression. Five patients were enrolled in
phase 1B; the reason for the end of treatment was AEs in
all 5 patients.
Baseline Characteristics

Statistical Methods

The MTD was defined to be the highest dose of NVPAUY922 given for 2 doses in the first treatment cycle; it
was expected to produce medically unacceptable doselimiting toxicity (DLT) in <33% of patients. The applied
adaptive BLRM was to provide an estimate of the highest
dose level of NVP-AUY922 that did not exceed the
MTD; it used the dose with the maximum probability of
targeted toxicity (DLT rate between 16% and 33%). The
use of the escalation-with-overdose-control principle limited the risk that a potential next dose would exceed the
MTD. The final selection of each MTD was based on the
recommendation of the BLRM, but it also took into
account further available safety and tolerability information. For both phase 1 and phase 1B, cohorts with 3
MTD-evaluable patients per dose level were planned; this
included 12 patients at the MTD level. At least 18
patients were planned for both phase 1 and phase 1B.
RESULTS
Patient Disposition

A total of 24 patients were enrolled in phase 1 of NVPAUY922 monotherapy (Table 1). Twelve patients
(50.0%) discontinued the study for reasons other than
Cancer

July 1, 2015

A majority of patients who enrolled in phase 1 were white
(79.2%), were male (62.5%), and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of grade 1
(Table 2). All 5 patients enrolled in phase 1B were white
and had received 1 prior antineoplastic line of therapy.
Safety
Phase 1 monotherapy

One patient (70 mg/m2 cohort) experienced a DLT
(grade 3 blurred vision). BLRM indicated that dose escalation beyond 70 mg/m2 was possible; however, this was
not implemented because of the potential risk of ocular
toxicity. For this reason, MTD for NVP-AUY922 was
not established. The recommended phase 2 dose of NVPAUY922 as a single-agent therapy, based on this trial and
adjunct data from the solid tumor study,19 was declared
to be 70 mg/m2. The median treatment duration was 5.5
weeks. Overall, 1 patient (in the 45 mg/m2 cohort) had 1
dose reduction due to a laboratory test abnormality. Four
patients had 1 dose delay, and 3 patients had >1 dose
delay; all (except one) were due to AEs.
All 24 patients reported 1 or more AEs, regardless of
the study drug relationship (Table 3). Ten patients
(41.7%) reported 1 or more grade 3 or 4 AEs, regardless

of the study drug relationship (most commonly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, each occurring in 2 patients
[8.3%]). Eighteen patients (75.0%) reported 1 or more
study drug–related AEs; of these, the most frequent AEs
were diarrhea (45.8%), nausea (16.7%), night blindness
(16.7%), photopsia (16.7%), visual impairment (16.7%),
and a prolonged QT interval (12.5%). Six patients
(25.0%) experienced study drug–related grade 3 or 4 AEs.
Ocular AEs, regardless of the study drug relationship, occurred in 9 patients (37.5%), all at doses of
45 mg/m2 or higher, with the incidence of eye disorders
ranging from 40.0% to 71.4%. Grade 3 ocular AEs were
reported in 4 patients (16.7%) and included night blindness, retinopathy, vision blurred, cataract, and reduced
visual acuity (each in 1 patient). Three patients died in
phase 1 because of disease progression. Seven patients
(29.2%) experienced SAEs. The most common SAEs,
regardless of the study drug relationship, were nausea,
vomiting, and retinopathy (each reported in 2 patients).
SAEs were predominantly reported in the 45 and 70 mg/
m2 dose groups (each in 3 patients). Eight patients
(33.3%) discontinued treatment because of AEs, regardless of the study drug relationship (3 patients discontinued
2188

because of SAEs). The most common discontinuation
events were ocular disorders (night blindness [n 5 2], retinopathy [n 5 2], ocular toxicity [n 5 1], optic neuropathy [n 5 1], and blurred vision [n 5 1]).

Phase 1B

A dose of 50 mg/m2 was selected as the starting dose for
part 1B, in which NVP-AUY922 was used in combination with bortezomib. Only 1 dose level was examined
(AUY922 at 50 mg/m2 plus bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2).
Three patients experienced DLTs (musculoskeletal pain,
diarrhea, and atypical noncardiac chest and musculoskeletal pain; all were grade 3 [1 patient each]). From these
results, the BRLM indicated de-escalation of the bortezomib dose to 0.7 mg/m2. However, because this dose
would have been less than that of the standard bortezomib
therapy and this suggested that a combination treatment
of NVP-AUY922 plus bortezomib was not feasible, a decision was made to discontinue further escalation of the
AUY922 dose. The MTD for the combination part was
thus not established. The median treatment duration was
3.0 weeks. Two patients had single dose decreases due to

The data are presented as numbers and percentages.

In the phase 1 monotherapy portion of the trial, none of
the patients achieved complete or partial responses; however, 16 patients (66.7%) had stable disease, and they
included 5 patients in the 70 mg/m2 dose cohort
(71.4%). Among the 5 patients treated in phase 1B, 1 had
a partial response, and the remaining 4 patients had stable
disease.

70 mg/m2, the concentration-time profiles of NVPAUY922 in blood on day 1 of cycle 1 were biphasic.
After an initial rapid decline in the a phase, NVPAUY922 exhibited a flat terminal elimination phase in
the profiles with half-lives of 80 hours at 8 mg/m2 and
116 hours at 70 mg/m2. The blood clearance and the volume of distribution of NVP-AUY922 increased with
doses (from a clearance of 3.28 L/h and a volume of distribution of 384 L at 8 mg/m2 to 11.0 L/h and 1666 L,
respectively, at 70 mg/m2). There was no drug

accumulation for NVP-AUY922 or its metabolite
BJP762 in the blood after repeated weekly doses. The
overall pharmacokinetic profiles of NVP-AUY922 and
BJP762 with coadministration with bortezomib were similar to those observed when NVP-AUY922 was given as a
single agent. The plasma half-life, clearance, and volume
of distribution for bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 when it was
coadministered with NVP-AUY922 were 69 hours,
28.2 L/hour, and 2214 L, respectively.
Pharmacodynamics

Treatment with NVP-AUY922 led to the induction of
HSP70, which plateaued after 30 mg/m2. The best
response of HSP70 induction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n 5 13) is shown in Figure 2. The pretreatment and posttreatment immunohistochemistry results
for a patient treated at 45 mg/m2 revealed an upregulation
of HSP70 that was suggestive of target engagement in tumor tissue (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
The identification of HSP90 inhibitors’ potential to block
multiple oncogenic signaling pathways has provided a rationale for targeting this molecular chaperone in a variety
of cancers.7 Several HSP90 inhibitors are in clinical development,20,21 but none of these have yet been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration or the European
Medicines Agency for the treatment of MM.
NVP-AUY922 has shown an acceptable safety profile at dose levels of 8 to 70 mg/m2 in phase 1, and the recommended phase 2 dose was declared to be 70 mg/m2
intravenously on a once weekly schedule similar to that

observed in the solid tumor study.19 Although BLRM
indicated the possibility of further dose escalation, this
was not implemented because of the potential risk of ocular toxicity as previously observed in the phase 1 solid
tumor study.19
The most frequently occurring study drug–related
AEs in the phase 1 were diarrhea, nausea, and ocular toxicities such as night blindness, photopsia, and visual impairment. The safety profile of NVP-AUY922 in this study
was similar to that reported in the solid tumor study.19
The ocular toxicity observed in the current study may be
attributable to HSP90 inhibitor–induced photoreceptor
degeneration and possibly related to tissue distribution of
water-soluble agents facilitating a high retina/plasma concentration ratio as well as the retinal elimination profile.22
Notably, no grade 4 or irreversible ocular toxicity was
observed in this trial. NVP-AUY922 was well distributed
with a terminal half-life of 116 hours at 70 mg/m2, which
was comparable to the half-life of 120 hours reported in
the solid tumor study.19 The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of bortezomib observed in the combination
phase were consistent with those observed in the steady
state when it was given as a single agent as reported in the
literature,23 and this suggests a lack of pharmacokinetic
drug interactions between the 2 drugs.
In phase 1 monotherapy, 66.7% of the patients had
stable disease. Even though an analysis of efficacy was not

for 13 patients taking part in the BM biomarker subset group: (A) before treatment (baseline) and (B) after treatment (C2D2).

the primary scope of this trial, it was striking that HSP90
inhibition led to compensatory HSP70 upregulation in
patients with MM, which potentially contributed to partial drug resistance (Fig. 3). Blocking this compensatory
mechanism through the combination of HSP90 with
HSP70 inhibitors may be a viable strategy for increasing
the efficacy of HSP90 inhibition, as already shown in
vitro.3,24 The combination of NVP-AUY922 with bortezomib was not feasible at the standard recommended dose
because of DLTs in 3 of 5 patients (grade 3 musculoskeletal pain and diarrhea) at the dose of 50 mg/m2.
In conclusion, NVP-AUY922 as a single agent
resulted in disease stabilization as the best response in
patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The safety profile of NVP-AUY922 in this study was comparable to that
reported for other indications with drug-related gastrointestinal and ocular toxicity. In future trials, more selected
patient populations harboring specific HSP90-dependent
oncoproteins should be chosen to enable the use of lower
doses, particularly if HSP90 inhibition is part of new
combinations. Mutual inhibition of survival feedback
loops must be ensured on the basis of preclinical data (eg,
by the combination of HSP90 with HSP70 inhibition or
even the PI3K/Akt/GSK3b pathway inhibitors because
the latter led to reduced HSP70 expression levels in MM
cells in vitro3).
