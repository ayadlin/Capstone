Tumor necrosis factor has also been reported to enhance
experimental metastases in vivo (5). In radiation studies, if the
lungs of mice are irradiated before cancer cells are injected into the
tail vein of the mice, the number of experimental pulmonary
metastases increased (6). Other studies have shown that prophylactic local irradiation to the lung of tumor-bearing mice increased
the incidence of spontaneous pulmonary metastases (7).
Van Putten et al. (8) reported that cyclophosphamide enhanced
formation of pulmonary metastases up to 1,000-fold in a mouse
model. In their study, cyclophosphamide was given 24 h before
tumor-cell injection. Because the half-life of cyclophosphamide is
only 17 min, the drug did not affect viability of tumor cells injected
24 h later (9). Carnel et al. (10) suggested that cyclophosphamide
induced changes within the pulmonary microvasculature where the
injected tumor cells must lodge to form metastases. Cyclophosphamide apparently killed macrophages or prevented the macrophages from killing the endothelium-trapped cancer cells. Iwamoto
et al. (11) showed cyclophosphamide-induced endothelial damage
using monolayer cell cultures in vitro.
We have previously observed that when host mice were
pretreated with cyclophosphamide, HCT-116 human colon cancer
cells survived and formed colonies in the liver after portal vein
injection. In unpretreated mice, these cells rapidly died after portal
vein injection. These results suggested that a cyclophosphamidesensitive host cellular system attacked the HCT-116 cells (12).
We previously showed major differences in the ability of different
cancer cells to extravasate and form metastases (13). The Lewis
lung carcinoma (LLC) and mouse mammary tumor (MMT), both
mouse cancer cell lines, could extravasate from vessels in nude
mice and subsequently form colonies. In contrast, in untreated
mice, most HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells still remained in
vessels 24 h after injection. The cells were mostly quiescent and
rarely extravasated.
We report here that the ability of fluorescent protein–labeled
HT1080 cells to proliferate intravascularly, extravasate, and form
extravascular colonies was greatly enhanced by the pretreatment of
the host nude mouse with cyclophosphamide, a powerful opposite
effect of this cancer drug.

Abstract
Although side effects of cancer chemotherapy are well known,
‘‘opposite effects’’ of chemotherapy that enhance the malignancy of the treated cancer are not well understood. In this
report, we describe the induction of intravascular proliferation, extravasation, and colony formation by cancer cells,
critical steps of metastasis, by pretreatment of host mice with
the commonly used chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide.
In contrast, in the unpretreated mice, most cancer cells
remained quiescent in vessels without extravasation. HT1080
human fibrosarcoma cells, labeled in the nucleus with green
fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein in the
cytoplasm for imaging, were injected into the epigastric
cranialis vein of nude mice. Twenty-four hours before cancer
cell injection, cyclophosphamide was given i.p. Double-labeled
cancer cells were imaged at the cellular level in live mice with
the Olympus OV100 Small Animal Imaging System with
variable magnification. Cyclophosphamide seems to interfere
with a host process that inhibits intravascular proliferation,
extravasation, and extravascular colony formation. Cyclophosphamide does not directly affect the cancer cells because
cyclophosphamide has been cleared by the time the cancer
cells were injected. This report shows an important unexpected ‘‘opposite effect’’ of chemotherapy that enhances critical
steps in malignancy rather than inhibiting them, suggesting
that certain current approaches to cancer chemotherapy
should be modified. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):516–20]

Introduction
Although side effects of cancer treatment are well known,
‘‘opposite effects,’’ which enhance the malignancy of the treated
cancer, are not well understood. In this regard, there have been
several reports that chemotherapy or irradiation can enhance
metastases. For example, tumor cell localization and metastatic
growth in the lung were enhanced after the administration of
Bleomycin, which caused endothelial cell injury (1). Monoclonal
antibodies to pulmonary endothelial cells enhanced lung tumor
colony formation (2). The induction of endothelial damage and
exposure of the subendothelial basal lamina may enhance lung
colony formation. Kerbel et al. (3, 4) have shown that toxic
chemotherapy increases tumor angiogenesis by mobilizing endothelial cell precursors in the bone marrow to migrate to the tumor.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of fluorescent protein–labeled HT1080 human
fibrosarcoma cells. To establish dual-color HT1080 human fibrosarcoma
(HT1080) cells, the cells were transfected with retroviral red fluorescent
protein (RFP) and histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) as previously
described (14, 15). In brief, the Hind III/Not I fragment from pDsRed2
(Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) was inserted into the Hind III/Not I site of
pLNCX2, which also contains the neomycin-resistance gene (neo; Clontech
Laboratories, Inc.). For vector production, PT67, an NIH3T3-derived
packaging cell line (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), was incubated with a

with retroviral supernatants of PT67-RFP cells for 72 h. Cells were cultured
in selective medium that contained 200 Ag/mL G418. The level of G418 was
increased stepwise up to 800 Ag/mL. The cells were then incubated with
retroviral supernatants of PT67 H2B-GFP cells. To select for double
transformants, cells were incubated in selective medium with hygromycin
for 72 h. The level of hygromycin was increased stepwise up to 400 Ag/mL
(16). Bright dual-color cells were thereby obtained.
Drugs and animals. Cyclophosphamide was obtained from SigmaAldrich. Five 4-week-old female athymic CD-1 nude mice were used in
this study. Mice were kept in a barrier facility under HEPA filtration.
Mice were fed with autoclaved laboratory rodent diet (Tecklad LM-485;
Western Research Products). All animal studies were conducted in
accordance with the principals and procedures outlined in the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under assurance number
A3873-1.

saturating amounts of pLNCX2-DsRed2 plasmid for 18 h. For selection of a
clone producing high amounts of an RFP retroviral vector (PT67-DsRed2),
the transfected PT67 cells were cultured in the presence of 200 to 1,000
Ag/mL G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), increased stepwise, for 7 days (16).
The histone H2B-GFP fusion gene was inserted at the Hind III/Cal I site
of the pLHCX (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). To establish a packaging cell
clone producing high amounts of a histone H2B-GFP retroviral vector,
the pLHCX histone H2B-GFP vector containing the hygromycin-resistance
gene (hyg ) plasmid was transfected in PT67 cells, using the same methods
described above for constructing PT67-DsRed2. The transfected cells were
cultured in the presence of 200 to 400 Ag/mL hygromycin and increased
stepwise, such that they produced high amounts of the H2B-GFP vector.
For RFP and H2B-GFP gene transduction, clones of HT1080 expressing
RFP in the cytoplasm were initially established. The cells were incubated

Enhancement of Metastases by Cyclophosphamide
Mouse model for in vivo imaging of dual-color HT1080 cells. Nude
mice were anesthetized with a ketamine mixture (10 AL ketamine HCl,
7.6 AL xylazine, 2.4 AL acepromazine maleate, and 10 AL H2O s.c.).
Cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) was injected into the i.p. cavity of the mice
24 h before cell injection. For cell injection, an arc-shaped incision was
made in the abdominal skin, and s.c. connective tissue was separated to free
the skin without injuring the epigastric cranialis artery and vein. The skin
flap was spread and fixed on a flat stand. Dual-color fluorescent HT1080
cells (1  106) were injected in the epigastric cranialis vein. The skin flap
was closed immediately after injection. Cancer cells, which were inside of
the skin flap, were directly imaged every 24 hr. The skin flap was completely
reversed after each repeated observation.
Fluorescence optical imaging and data analysis. The OV100 Small
Animal Imaging System (Olympus Corp.) containing an MT-20 light source
(Olympus Biosystems) and DP70 CCD camera (Olympus Corp.) was used
for real-time cellular imaging in live mice. High-resolution images were
captured directly on a PC (Fujitsu Siemens computers). Images were
processed for contrast and brightness and analyzed with the use of Paint
Shop Pro 8 software.

extensively intravascularly, extravasate, and subsequently form
colonies (Fig. 1A). The colonies increased in size and were visualized
even at low magnification. In contrast, extravasated colonies were
not formed in nonpretreated mice (Fig. 1B).
Types of metastatic colonies formed in cyclophosphamidetreated mice. There were two types of colonies formed by HT1080
cells in the cyclophosphamide-pretreated mice. One type of colony
formed outside of the vessel after HT1080-GFP-RFP cells extravasated (Fig. 1C and D). The other type of colony formed within the
vessels without extravasation. The type of colony formed depended
upon the width of the vessels. In narrow vessels, HT1080 cells had a
higher extravasation frequency than in wide vessels where HT1080
usually formed colonies within the vessels without extravasation.
Eventual regression of extravasated colonies in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Within hours after cell injection in the
cyclophosphamide-pretreated mice, HT1080 cells extravasated
and subsequently grew around the outer surface of the vessels.
However, by 1 week after cyclophosphamide pretreatment of
the mice, the colonies decreased in size (Fig. 2A–D). Although the
colonies were decreasing in size, the cells became round and
brighter. In contrast to the colonies outside of the vessels, the tumor
colonies inside the vessels continued to proliferate and increase
in size.
Proliferation and spread of intravascular HT1080 cells to
peripheral vessels in cyclophosphamide-pretreated mice. After
the HT1080 cells proliferated within the vessels of the cyclophosphamide-pretreated mice, some cells seemed to be pushed out to
peripheral vessels by 14 days after cell injection (Fig. 3A and B).

Results and Discussion
Intravascular proliferation, extravasation, and micrometastasis in cyclophosphamide-pretreated mice. In contrast to other
cancer cell types such as the LCC or MMT cells (MMT060562),
HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells only rarely extravasated in nude
mice (13). Even at 24 h after injection, the majority of the HT1080
cells remained in vessels without extravasation, which were
expanding apparently to maintain blood flow. However, in mice
pretreated with cyclophosphamide, HT1080 cells could proliferate

mice. A, 24 h after cell injection, many
HT1080 cells have arrested in the vessel.
Bar, 200 Am. B, at 72 h, more HT1080 cells
disappeared and fragmented cytoplasms
are visualized (arrow). Bar, 200 Am.

96 h. Bar, 200 Am. D, a large colony is
visualized, which contains fragmented
dying cells. The green fluorescence is
derived from GFP-H2B in the nucleus,
and red fluorescence is from RFP-tagged
cytoplasm. Note that the vessel expands
due to the tumor thrombus. Bar, 200 Am.

cell injury (10, 11). This could be the case in the present report
where injured endothelia could allow cells to extravasate more
readily, especially cells with an apparent very poor capability to
extravasate such as HT1080. However, our previous results showed
cyclophosphamide pretreatment of the host mouse greatly
decreased cell death of cancer cells in the portal circulation (15).
This result, in combination with the enhancement of intravascular
proliferation, extravasation, and subsequent colony formation by
cyclophosphamide shown in the present study, suggest a hostbased cancer cell–killing process is inhibited by cyclophosphamide.
The recovery of the host-based cell killing of the extravasated
cancer cells a week after cyclophoshamide pretreatment could
explain the regression of the extravasated colonies of HT1080 over
time. Thus, both cyclophosphamide-induced endothelial injury as
well as cyclophosphamide inhibition of an innate cell-based
antitumor system could play a role in the ‘‘opposite’’ effect of
cyclophosphamide observed in this study.
Our results suggest such opposite effects of cyclophosphamide
that can enhance critical steps in metastasis must be taken into
consideration for administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
clinic.

These peripheral intravascular colonies did not decrease in size
1 week after cyclophosphamide pretreatment, in contrast to the
extravascular colonies that eventually regressed. Fig. 3C shows time
course imaging of i.v. invasion and proliferation of HT1080 cells.
Seven days after HT1080-GFP-RFP cell injection, peripheral vessels
with many cancer cells were visualized. The mass of HT1080 cells
seemed to partially block blood flow and caused the vessel to
widen. Thus, the HT1080 cells formed colonies in larger vessels
and then spread to peripheral vessels throughout the entire body.
When the vessels were too narrow, increasing colony size due to
cancer-cell proliferation caused the vessels to widen (Fig. 3C). In
narrow capillaries, the HT1080 cells migrated single file (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, the number of HT1080 cells decreased in the vessels of
nonpretreated mice (Fig. 4A–D). There were only occasionally small
colony-like tumor thrombi, which contained fragmented dying
tumor cells, which seem to remain in vessels (Fig. 4D). The vessels
expanded due to these tumor thrombi.
Al-Mehdi et al. (17) also observed apparent intravascular tumor
cell proliferation in mouse lungs perfused ex vivo. The current
results show this phenomenon in vivo. The ability of cancer cells to
proliferate intravascularly has been a controversial issue (18). The
results in this report show definitive intravascular proliferation of
tumor cells in vivo. This phenomenon has great implications for
metastasis.
The results in this study indicate cyclophosphamide, which was
given 24 h before cancer cell injection, enhanced intravascular
proliferation, extravasation, and subsequent colony formation of
the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma. Previous studies had suggested
that cyclophosphamide may enhance metastasis due to endothelial
