paracrine mediator and is involved in a variety of biological
processes, including immunoregulation and cell survival (3). PGE2
stimulates cancer cell growth and invasion, whereas inhibition of
PGE2 synthesis blocks growth of cancer cells (3, 4). The effect of
PGE2 has been attributed to its known capacity to bind to one or
more of its four G protein–coupled receptors, designated EP1, EP2,
EP3, and EP4 (5). These receptors have been implicated in cancer
cell growth and progression (5, 6).
Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine-threonine protein kinase
that mediates diverse cellular functions. ILK activity is stimulated
by cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix and by growth
factors in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–dependent
manner, and the activation of ILK promotes cell survival and
protects against apoptosis (7–9). ILK is a PI3K-dependent effector
of integrin-mediated cell adhesion as well as growth factors and
is an upstream regulator of Akt. Overexpression of ILK leads to
anchorage-independent cell growth and tumorigenicity in nude
mice (8). Furthermore, elevated ILK expression and activity have
been shown in several types of cancers, including lung cancer
(10, 11). Hence, ILK seems to be important in carcinogenesis.
Here, we report that PGE2 stimulates human lung carcinoma cell
growth through induction of ILK and activation of its downstream
signals, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and
PI3K/Akt. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a
link between PGE2 and ILK in human lung carcinoma.

Abstract
Cyclooxygenase-2–derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulates
tumor cell growth and progression. However, the mechanisms
by which PGE2 increases tumor growth remain incompletely
understood. In studies performed in non–small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) cells, we found that PGE2 stimulates the
expression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK). ILK small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the mitogenic effects of PGE2. In
view of its perceived importance, we turned our attention to
the mechanisms involved in PGE2-induced ILK expression and
found that this effect was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE2
receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. Furthermore, we
showed that PGE2 induction of ILK was associated with
phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, which were abrogated by
ILK siRNA. Transient transfection, gel mobility shift assays,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed
that PGE2 induced ILK promoter activity and increased Sp1,
although it had no effect on nuclear factor-KB and AP-2 DNAbinding activity. Blockade of Sp1 abrogated the effect of PGE2
on expression of ILK and promoter activity and on cell growth.
In summary, our observations show that PGE2 increases
NSCLC cell growth through increased ILK expression, which is
dependent on EP4 signaling and on induction of Sp1 protein
and Sp1 DNA-binding activity in the ILK promoter. These
studies suggest a novel molecular mechanism by which PGE2
stimulates NSCLC cell growth and unveils a new molecular
target for the development of therapies against NSCLC.

Introduction
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in the United States, and 30% to 40% of newly diagnosed
patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with
regionally advanced and unresectable stage III disease (1). Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is frequently observed in
several human cancers, including lung cancer. Elevated tumor
COX-2 expression is associated with increased angiogenesis, tumor
invasion, and suppression of host immunity and promotes tumor
cell resistance to apoptosis (2). One of the bioactive products of
COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serves as an autocrine and

PGE2 Induces Lung Cancer Cell Growth through ILK
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of incubation,
cells were treated with or without dmPGE2 or with mithramycin A
(100 nmol/L) for 2 h before exposure of the cells to PGE2 for an additional
24 h. The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of luciferase
activities were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter kit according
to recommendations by the manufacturer (Promega). The assays for firefly
luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially in a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer equipped with dual
injectors. Changes in firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted
after normalization with changes in Renilla luciferase activity within the
same sample.
Enzyme immunoassay for PGE2. H1838 cells (1  104) were treated
with NS398 (10 Amol/L) for 48 h or transfected with control or ILK siRNA
for 40 h. Afterwards, PGE2 levels that secreted into culture medium were
determined by enzyme immunoassay according to the instructions of the
manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). The concentrations of PGE2 were
determined using a microplate reader (model 450, Bio-Rad). The detection
limit for PGE2 was 15 pg/mL with <0.01% cross-reactivity for other
prostaglandins.
[Methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation assay. This method was described previously (12). Briefly, human NSCLC cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of dmPGE2 for the indicated time period or were
transfected with ILK siRNA for 30 h or with inactive (ILK-S343A) and
superactive ILK cDNA (ILK-S343D) using the Oligofectamine reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 24 h before incubating
with 1 ACi/mL [methyl-3H]thymidine (specific activity, 250 Ci/mmol;
Amersham) and exposing the cells to PGE2 (dmPGE2) for an additional
24 h. Afterwards, medium was removed and attached cells were washed
with 1 PBS. Attached cells were treated with ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) at 4jC for 20 min and washed once with 6% TCA. Cells were
solubilized with 0.1 N NaOH and counted in a liquid scintillation counter in
4 mL of scintillation fluid.
Cell viability assay. NSCLC cells (105 per well) were treated with
increasing concentrations of dmPGE2 for the indicated time period or were
transfected with ILK siRNA for 30 h before exposing the cells to dmPGE2
(0.1 Amol/L) for an additional 48 h in 96-well plates. In a separate
experiment, cells were transfected with inactive (ILK-S343A) and superactive ILK (ILK-S343D) cDNA using the Oligofectamine reagent according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated
with or without dmPGE2 (0.1 Amol/L) or with mithramycin A (100 nmol/L)
for 2 h. Afterwards, the numbers of viable cells in culture were determined
using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit, which evaluates
the presence of ATP, an indicator of metabolically active cells, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) experiments were performed as described before (12). The
oligonucleotides used as probes were wild-type Sp1 (5¶-GGCCCCCACGGGCGGG-3¶), mutant Sp1 (5¶-GGCCCCCACGGttGGG-3¶), wild-type NFnB (5¶-ACGGGAGTTCCCCG-3¶), mutant NF-nB (5¶-ACGttAGTTCCCCG-3¶),
wild-type AP-2 (5¶-TCCTCCCCGCCTCCGC-3¶), and mutant AP-2 (5¶-TCCTCtttGCCTCCGC-3¶), which are based on the ILK promoter sequences (15) and
consensus Sp1-binding motifs (5¶-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3¶).
The complimentary sequences were annealed and purified following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The Sp1, NF-nB, and AP-2 oligonucleotides were
end labeled with [g-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase as recommended by the manufacturer. Nuclear proteins (5 Ag) were first incubated
under binding conditions [10 mmol/L HEPES, Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mmol/L
KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 12% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 Ag
poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid)] for 10 min, and then we added
[g-32P]ATP probe for another 20 min at room temperature in a final volume
of 20 AL in the presence or absence of Sp1 and Sp2 antibodies (2 Ag/AL
each). For cold competition, a 100-fold excess of the respective unlabeled
consensus oligonucleotides was incubated for 15 min before adding the
probe. The same amount of mutated oligonucleotides mixed with the probe
was used as another control. All of these experiments were performed in the
same binding conditions as described before. Afterwards, the protein-DNA
complexes were electrophoresed on a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel at

published data (12, 13). The reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried
out as previously described (12). The samples were first denatured at 95jC
for 30 s, followed by 32 PCR cycles, each with temperature variations as
follows: 95jC for 30 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 30 s. The last cycle was
followed by an additional extension incubation of 7 min at 72jC. Analysis of
amplicons was accomplished on 1% agarose gel containing 0.2 Ag/AL
ethidium bromide and visualized under UV transilluminator.
Western blot analysis. The procedure was performed as previously
described (12). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad
protein assay. Equal amounts of protein from whole-cell lysates were
solubilized in 2 SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS (8–12%)
polyacrylamide gels. Blots were incubated with antibodies against EP4, ILK,
Sp1, Sp2, ERK1/2, Akt, and their phosphorylated forms (1:1,000). After
washing, the blots were washed and followed by incubation with a
secondary goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000; Cell Signaling). The blots were washed,
transferred to freshly made enhanced chemiluminescence solution
(Amersham) for 1 min, and exposed to X-ray film. In controls, the primary
antibodies were omitted or replaced with a control rabbit IgG.
Treatment with EP4, ILK, and Sp1 small interfering RNA. The ILK
small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Cell Signaling. Sp1
siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The EP4 siRNA and
control nonspecific siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. as described previously (13). For the transfection procedure, cells
were grown to 60% confluence, and ILK, EP4, and Sp1 siRNAs and control
siRNA were transfected using the Oligofectamine reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Oligofectamine reagent was incubated
with serum-free medium for 10 min. Subsequently, a mixture of respective
siRNA was added. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the
mixture was diluted with medium and added to each well. The final
concentration of siRNAs in each well was 100 nmol/L. After culturing for
30 h, cells were washed and resuspended in new culture medium in the
presence or absence of dmPGE2 for an additional 24 h for Western blot and
cell growth and gel mobility shift assays.
Site-directed mutagenesis. To prepare site-directed mutants of the
promoter, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized: mutated Sp1
(+78–90 bp), 5¶ GGCCCCCACGGGGCttGGC; mutated nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB; +121–136 bp), 5¶ GACGGcAGTTCCCCGG. The lower case letters
indicate mutations. The ILK plasmid constructs containing site-directed
mutations of Sp1 and NF-nB cis-acting elements were generated by
oligonucleotide-directed mutation using the GeneEditor in vitro sitedirected mutagenesis system according to recommendations by the
manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, double-stranded ILK promoter plasmid
was alkaline denatured, precipitated, washed, and resuspended in TrisEDTA buffer. Mutated Sp1 and NF-nB oligonucleotides and selection
oligonucleotides were annealed; mutant strands were synthesized, ligated,
and transformed into BMH 71-18 mutS-competent cells. The mutated Sp1
and NF-nB ILK plasmids were isolated and transformed into JM109competent cells. Colonies (10–15) were selected and screened for mutants
by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer.
Transient transfection assay. The human ILK promoter constructs
(pILK-Pr) ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were a gift from Drs.
Michalik and Desvergne (Center for Integrative Genomics, University of
Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) and have been reported previously (14).
The ILK promoter construct contains f730 bp of the 5¶ flanking region of
the human ILK gene connected to the pGL3 Basic Luciferase reporter
vector (Promega). The inactive (ILK-S343A) and superactive ILK cDNA (ILKS343D) in pUSEamp vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus
promoter were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Briefly, NSCLC cells
were seeded at a density of 5  105 per well in six-well dishes and grown to
50% to 60% confluence. For each well, 2 Ag of the above ILK plasmid DNA
constructs, with or without 0.2 Ag of the internal control phRL-TK Synthetic
Renilla Luciferase Reporter Vector, were cotransfected into the cells using
FUGENE 6 lipofection reagent ( for ILK promoters; Roche Molecular
Biochemicals) as described in our earlier work (13). In a separate
experiment, cells were transfected with the inactive (ILK-S343A) and
superactive ILK cDNA (ILK-S343D) using the Oligofectamine reagent

supernatants containing fragmented chromatin were precleared by adding
salmon sperm-DNA protein A-agarose beads. A small portion of the
supernatants was kept as ‘‘input’’ material. The remaining cleared
chromatin was incubated overnight with 5 Ag of the anti-Sp1 antibody
to study Sp1-DNA interactions, or normal human IgG (Upstate
Biotechnology) as negative control. Finally, an overnight incubation with
no antibody was also done. Five percent of the sample (f10 Ag of DNA)
from each immunoprecipitation was reserved for input controls. DNA was
purified with QIAquick PCR purification columns according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen Sciences). Genomic sequences of
interest were amplified by PCR using primers (+14/+33 bp) 5¶TCGGGCTCTAATATCCGCC-3¶ ( forward) and (+172/+191 bp) 5¶CCTCTCGTCGCACTGAAAC-3¶ (reverse). A total of 1% to 2.5% of each
immunoprecipitate was assayed by PCR using primers specific for the
region of interest. For semiquantitative PCR, the sample signal was
calculated by comparison with titrated inputs, separated on an agarose
gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. A 100-bp ladder (Invitrogen) was
used as a size standard.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three
times. All data from Western blot analysis, PCR, luciferase assays, gel shift
assays, and cell growth assays were expressed as mean F SD. The data
presented in some figures are from a representative experiment, which was
qualitatively similar in the replicate experiments. Statistical significance was
determined with Student’s t test (two tailed) comparison between two
groups of data set. Asterisks shown in the figures indicate significant
differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding
control condition (P < 0.05, see figure legends).

Results
PGE2 increases human lung cancer cell proliferation
through induction of LK. We first examined the effect of
exogenous PGE2 on NSCLC cell growth. Using two NSCLC cell
lines (H1838 and H1792), we showed that PGE2 induced NSCLC cell
proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner with maximal
effect at a concentration of 0.1 Amol/L at 24 hours as determined
by Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Fig. 1A and C). This was
confirmed by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (Fig. 1B and D).
Because ILK has been shown to promote tumor cell survival, we
examined if PGE2 also affected the expression of ILK. We found
that dmPGE2 enhanced both mRNA (Fig. 1E and F) and protein
levels (Fig. 1G and H) of ILK in a time- and dose-dependent
manner as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis,
respectively.
To test whether PGE2 affects ILK through its EP4 receptor, we
blocked EP4 function using a selective EP4 antagonist, AH23848.
We showed that AH23848 abrogated the effect of PGE2 on
induction of ILK mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 1I and J). In
contrast, an EP2 antagonist, AH6809, had no effect (Fig. 1I and J).
This was further confirmed by using EP4 siRNA approach (Fig. 1K).
Silencing EP4 expression blocked the effect of PGE2 on induction of
ILK protein expression, whereas the control siRNA had no effect
(Fig. 1K).

Figure 2. Silencing of ILK had no effect on PGE2
secretion or COX-2 and EP4 expression. A, top,
cellular protein was isolated from H1838 cells in the
presence or absence of control or ILK siRNA (100
nmol/L) for 30 h and then subjected to Western blot
analysis for COX-2 and ILK; bottom, H1838 cells
(1  104) were transfected with control or ILK siRNA
(100 nmol/L) for 30 h followed by measurement of
medium PGE2 levels using a PGE2 enzyme
immunoassay kit according to the instruction of the
manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). B, cellular protein
was isolated from H1838 cells in the presence or
absence of control or ILK siRNA (100 nmol/L) for
30 h and then subjected to Western blot analysis for
EP4 and ILK. C, H1838 cells (1  104) were treated
with NS398 (10 Amol/L) for 48 h. PGE2 levels secreted
into culture medium were determined by a PGE2
enzyme immunoassay kit according to the instruction
of the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). D, cellular
protein was isolated from H1838 cells treated with
NS398 (10 Amol/L) for up to 24 h in the presence or
absence of dmPGE2 (0.1 Amol/L) and then subjected to
Western blot analysis for ILK protein.

Figure 3. ILK siRNA inhibits PGE2induced phosphorylation of ERK and Akt.
A, cellular protein was isolated from H1838
cells that were cultured with increasing
concentrations of dmPGE2 for 24 h
followed by Western blot analysis with
antibodies against total Akt and
phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt). B, cellular
protein was isolated from H1838 cells that
were cultured with 0.1 Amol/L dmPGE2 for
up to 48 h followed by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against total Akt
and phosphorylated Akt. C, cellular protein
was isolated from H1838 cells that were
cultured with increasing concentrations of
dmPGE2 for 24 h followed by Western blot
analysis with antibodies against total
ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2 ). D, cellular protein was
isolated from H1838 cells that were
cultured with 0.1 Amol/L dmPGE2 for up to
48 h followed by Western blot analysis with
antibodies against total ERK1/2 and
phosphorylated ERK1/2. E, cellular protein
was isolated from H1838 cells cultured for
30 h in the presence or absence of
control or ILK siRNA (100 nmol/L) before
exposure of cells to dmPGE2 for an
additional 2 h and then subjected to
Western blot analysis for ILK, ERK1/2, and
phosphorylated ERK1/2. F, cellular protein
was isolated from H1838 cells cultured
for 30 h in the presence or absence of
control or ILK siRNA (100 nmol/L) before
exposure of cells to dmPGE2 for an
additional 2 h and then subjected to
Western blot analysis for ILK, Akt, and
phosphorylated Akt. Actin served as
internal control for normalization purposes.

manner with maximal stimulation in 24 hours at 0.1 Amol/L
concentration (Fig. 3A and B). Total Akt protein was not affected.
PGE2 also stimulated phosphorylation of ERK in a similar timeand dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3C and D). Similar results were
obtained with H1792 cells (data not shown).
ILK is a downstream substrate of PI3K and an important
upstream kinase for the regulation of protein kinase B/Akt (18).
Therefore, we next examined if knockdown of ILK could block the
effect of PGE2 on its downstream proteins ERK and Akt. We found
that ILK siRNA eliminated the stimulatory effects of PGE2 on
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3E) and of Akt (Fig. 3F), whereas
the ILK siRNA alone or a control siRNA had no effect. Similar
results were obtained with H1792 cells (data not shown).
PGE2 increased ILK promoter activity. Having established a
role for ILK in PGE2-stimulated NSCLC cell proliferation, we next
examined whether the effects of PGE2 on ILK expression occur
at the transcriptional level. The ILK promoter contains multiple
transcription factor-binding sites, including AP-2, NF-nB, and Sp1
(Fig. 4A). We found that H1838 and H1792 cells transfected with
the wild-type ILK promoter ( 267/+157 bp) luciferase reporter
construct and exposed to PGE2 showed increased promoter activity
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we showed that PGE2-induced ILK
promoter activity was eliminated in ILK promoter reporter
constructs in which one Sp1 site (+78–90 bp), but not one NF-nB
site, was mutated (Fig. 4C).
To further explore the role of PGE2 in regulation of ILK promoter
activity, EMSAs were performed to identify the transcription
factors involved. We found that H1838 cells treated with PGE2
showed a significant increase in Sp1 (Fig. 4D), but small or no
effects were observed for NF-nB (Fig. 4E) and AP-2 (Fig. 4F) nuclear

We then tested whether ILK mediated PGE2-induced cell
growth and found that the ILK siRNA inhibited cell growth
induced by PGE2 as determined by Luminescent Cell Viability
assays (Fig. 1L). To further evaluate the role of ILK in mediating
the effect of PGE2 on cell growth, cells were transfected with
overexpression and inactive ILK plasmids. We showed that
whereas the inactive ILK plasmid (ILK-S343A) transfected into
cells significantly diminished the PGE2-induced cell growth, cells
transfected with hyperactive ILK vector (ILK-S343D) showed an
induction in cell growth, and this was further enhanced in the
presence of PGE2 as determined by Luminescent Cell Viability
assays (Fig. 1M). Similar results were obtained with H1792 cells
(data not shown).
Silencing of ILK had no effect on PGE2 secretion and COX-2/
EP4 expression. We also tested whether expression of ILK affects
COX-2, PGE2, and EP4 levels. We showed that silencing of ILK had
no effect on expression of COX-2 protein (Fig. 2A, top), PGE2
production (Fig. 2A, bottom), and expression of EP4 protein
(Fig. 2B). Others have reported that blockade of COX-2 inhibited
ILK (16). Consistent with this, we found that NS398, a COX-2
inhibitor, reduced PGE2 secretion (Fig. 2C). It also inhibited the
expression of ILK protein, which was partially restored by
administration of exogenous PGE2 (dmPGE2; Fig. 2D).
PGE2 increases phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt through
ILK. The PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are involved in
the control of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. A link
between PGE2 and activation of PI3K and ERK has been reported in
other studies (2, 13, 17), but their role in NSCLC remains unclear.
Here, we report that dmPGE2 increases the phosphorylation of Akt,
a downstream target of PI3K, in a time- and dose-dependent

To determine if Sp1 complex bound to the endogenous Sp1
site of the ILK promoter region, which is critical for PGE2mediated effect on ILK expression, we performed ChIP assays
on NSCLC cells. Sp1 occupancy of the Sp1 (+87) site on the
ILK promoter was enhanced by exposure of cells to PGE2.
Sp1 was immunoprecipitated from H1838 cell nuclear extracts
and the associated DNA was assessed by PCR amplification.
The DNA sequence, including the Sp1 site, was specifically
immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 but not control IgG
(Fig. 5F). This suggests that these sequences are bona fide
Sp1-binding sites, and PGE2 induces ILK expression by
stimulating Sp1 binding to the ILK gene promoter in NSCLC
cells. Similar results were obtained with H1792 cells (data not
shown).

The role of transcription factor Sp1 in PGE2 induction of
ILK and cell growth. We further tested the role of Sp1 in
mediating PGE2-induced ILK expression in human lung carcinoma
cells. PGE2 induced the expression of Sp1 protein in a timedependent manner (Fig. 5A). Mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1,
abrogated PGE2-induced ILK protein expression (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these findings, we found that treatment with mithramycin A resulted in inhibition of PGE2-induced ILK promoter activity
(Fig. 5C). Mithramycin A also reduced the stimulatory effect of
PGE2 on NSCLC cell growth (Fig. 5D). This was mimicked by
knockdown of the Sp1 gene because Sp1 siRNA abrogated the
expression of Sp1 protein (Fig. 5E, top) and antagonized the
stimulatory effect of PGE2 on cell growth as determined by cell
viability assays (Fig. 5E). Note that the control siRNA had no effect.

PGE2 Induces Lung Cancer Cell Growth through ILK

Discussion

mediated up-regulation of ILK reflected transactivation of the
gene. To this end, we performed transient transcription experiments using human ILK promoter-reporter constructs connected
to a luciferase reporter gene and found that PGE2 increased ILK
promoter activity. The induction of ILK promoter activity by
PGE2 was abrogated when Sp1, but not NF-nB, sites were
mutated in the ILK promoter, suggesting a role for Sp1 in
mediating the effect of PGE2 on ILK promoter activity. Several
transcription factor-binding sites within regions of the ILK
promoter have been characterized, including regulatory elements
for AP-2, NF-nB, and Sp1 (15). We evaluated the possibility that
these sites might play a role in PGE2-induced ILK expression. We
showed that treatment of H1838 cells with PGE2 significantly
increased protein-binding activity of Sp1 in the ILK gene
promoter, although it had little effects on AP-2 and NF-nB.
This, together with the supershift assay results, indicates that
Sp1 binding to the Sp1 site is necessary for the up-regulation of
ILK gene transcription in response to PGE2. We also found that
PGE2 induced expression of Sp1; this led to enhanced ILK signal.
By mutating the Sp1 site, the effect of PGE2 on ILK promoter
activity was abolished, further suggesting a key role for Sp1 in
mediating the effect of PGE2.
To our knowledge, a role for the Sp1 site in regulation of ILK
expression has not been reported. Sp1 is a member of a family
of transcription factors, which bind GC/GT-rich promoter
elements through three C2H2-type zinc fingers, and plays an
important role in tumor growth and metastasis by regulating the
expression of cell cycle genes and vascular endothelial growth
factor because Sp1/KLF proteins are also potential targets for
cancer chemotherapy (32). Sp1 regulates the activation of many
genes involved in tumor growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.
Down-regulation of Sp1 activity may inhibit urokinase-type
plasminogen activator receptor expression and may reduce the
migration ability of breast cancer cells, indicating its potential
therapeutic use to prevent tumor dissemination (33). Overexpression of Sp1 is thought to be important in the malignant
transformation of human fibroblasts (34). Mithramycin A, a
DNA-binding antibiotic that inhibits Sp1 activity and Sp1
binding to DNA, has been shown to block gene promoter
functions and to inhibit promoter-dependent transcription in
several cells studied (35, 36). Consistent with these observations,
we found that cells exposed to mithramycin A showed inhibition
of PGE2-induced ILK protein expression and promoter activity.
In addition, silencing of Sp1 using siRNA approaches also
overcame the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on cell growth. Whereas
the ILK inactive expression vector caused inhibition of ILK
promoter activity and cell growth, cells overexpressing ILK
overcame the inhibitory effect of the Sp1 inhibitor on ILK
promoter activity and on cell proliferation. This, together with
the results of ChIP assays, highlights the critical role of Sp1
transactivation of the ILK gene promoter.
In summary, we showed that PGE2 stimulates NSCLC cell
proliferation via EP4-mediated signals that activate ILK through
increased Sp1 expression and Sp1 DNA-binding activity. In turn,
ILK stimulates ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways culminating
in cell proliferation. To our knowledge, this represents the first
demonstration of a direct link between PGE2 and ILK. Furthermore,
this work unveils a novel molecular mechanism by which PGE2
stimulates NSCLC cell growth, which might lead to new
therapeutic strategies for NSCLC.

PGE2 plays important roles in proliferation, differentiation, and
inflammation (19). PGE2 has been shown to enhance tumor growth
and to increase vascularization in several systems (19, 20). We and
others reported that PGE2 induces NSCLC cell growth (3, 4). The
cellular mechanisms by which PGE2 promotes tumor growth,
especially NSCLC cell growth, have not been fully elucidated.
Herein, we report that PGE2 increases the expression of ILK. In
turn, activation of ILK promotes cell growth (this report) and
protects against apoptosis (7–9).
The concentrations of PGE2 used in this study were based on
our previous work showing that fibronectin, a matrix glycoprotein, induced PGE2 production in NSCLC cells in vitro (12).
Similar or even higher doses of exogenous PGE2 have been shown
to suppress both Th1- and Th2-polarized antigen-specific human
T-cell responses and reduce radiation-induced apoptosis in
human colon cancer cells (21, 22). The effect of PGE2 has been
attributed to its known capacity to bind to its four G protein–
coupled receptors (5, 6). Among them is EP4, a PGE2 receptor
subtype that has been implicated in tumor cell growth and
progression (23). In this study, blockade of EP4 by antagonists
and by EP4 siRNA abrogated the effect of PGE2 on ILK protein
expression, suggesting that EP4 mediates the effect of PGE2 on
ILK expression.
ILK has been implicated in the regulation of anchoragedependent cell growth/survival, cell cycle progression, and cell
invasion and migration. Furthermore, blockade of ILK has been
shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in several studies (8, 9, 24). One
study showed that an ILK inhibitor, QLT-0267, induced apoptosis in
human breast cancer cells, although it had no effect on Akt Ser473
phosphorylation and apoptosis in normal human breast epithelial
or vascular smooth muscle cells (25). Interestingly, overexpression
of ILK has been found in human NSCLC cells (11, 26). We found
that exogenous overexpression of ILK enhanced NSCLC cell
proliferation, whereas cells transfected with ILK inactive cDNA
showed inhibition of growth in the setting of PGE2 stimulation. The
ILK inactive cDNA used acts as a dominant negative and has been
shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in other study (7). These
findings unveil a correlation between the expression of ILK and
NSCLC cell growth and suggest that ILK plays significant roles in
the aggressive growth properties of NSCLC.
Interestingly, we showed that silencing of ILK had no effect on
COX-2 and EP4 expression and did not affect PGE2 production in
our system, suggesting that ILK plays no role in controlling COX-2/
PGE2 and EP4 functions and, therefore, that ILK is not upstream of
COX-2/PGE2 and EP4. Instead, ILK is downstream of COX-2/PGE2,
and consistent with a report by others (16), the COX-2 inhibitor
NS398 reduced the secretion of PGE2 and the expression of ILK,
which was partially restored by dmPGE2.
ILK is an important upstream kinase for ERK and Akt and their
downstream signals (9, 27). PGE2 has been shown to stimulate
tumor cell growth through activation of ERK and PI3K/Akt signal
pathways in several studies (28, 29). Consistent with reports by
others (30), our results suggest that ILK is an upstream regulator of
ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signal cascades in human lung carcinoma
cells. Similarly, others found that QLT-0267, an inhibitor of ILK,
blocked the phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets in
glioma cells (31).
Having shown the important role of ILK in PGE2-related
NSCLC proliferation, we further investigated whether the PGE2-
