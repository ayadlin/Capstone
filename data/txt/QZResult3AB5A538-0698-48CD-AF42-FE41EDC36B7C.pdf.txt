Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 85% of primary renal neoplasms, and
is rarely curable when metastatic. Approximately 70% of RCCs are clear-cell type
(ccRCC), and in >80% the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is mutated or silenced. We
developed a novel, high-content, screening strategy for the identification of small
molecules that are synthetic lethal with genes mutated in cancer. In this strategy,
the screen and counterscreen are conducted simultaneously by differentially labeling
mutant and reconstituted isogenic tumor cell line pairs with different fluorochromes
and using a highly sensitive high-throughput imaging-based platform. This approach
minimizes confounding factors from sequential screening, and more accurately
replicates the in vivo cancer setting where cancer cells are adjacent to normal cells.
A screen of ~12,800 small molecules identified homoharringtonine (HHT), an FDAapproved drug for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, as a VHL-synthetic lethal
agent in ccRCC. HHT induced apoptosis in VHL-mutant, but not VHL-reconstituted,
ccRCC cells, and inhibited tumor growth in 30% of VHL-mutant patient-derived
ccRCC tumorgraft lines tested. Building on a novel screening strategy and utilizing a
validated RCC tumorgraft model recapitulating the genetics and drug responsiveness
of human RCC, these studies identify HHT as a potential therapeutic agent for a subset
of VHL-deficient ccRCCs.

INTRODUCTION

range from 62-97% depending on the size of the tumor
[2]. However, once the cancer has metastasized to other
organs, the five-year survival rate is much lower, at only
8-41% [2]. As ccRCC is resistant to standard cancer
treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, treatment
options, until recently, were greatly limited [3].
The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, which encodes

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of
kidney cancer, with roughly 60,000 new cases reported
each year [1], and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
represents ~70% of all RCCs. The mainstay treatment for
localized ccRCC is surgery, and five-year survival rates

that provides high-content information of drug effects
on the two cell populations. 4) Our versatile platform is
amenable not only to the identification of synthetic lethal
compounds, but also compounds that are synergistic with
existing drugs. 5) Follow-up studies take advantage of a
state-of-the-art RCC tumorgraft platform that evaluates the
activity of candidate drugs against patient tumor samples
implanted into immunocompromised mice that reproduce
the responsiveness of ccRCC to drugs in the clinic [22].
Here, we report the identification of
homoharringtonine (HHT) as a synthetic lethal compound
effective against VHL-deficient ccRCC cells in our screen.
HHT is a plant alkaloid that has been studied for many
decades as an anti-leukemic agent (particularly in China),
and in 2012, a semi-synthetic form of HHT (ssHHT;
omacetaxine mepesuccinate) was approved by the FDA
for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
[23]. Testing of HHT in our validated tumorgraft model
showed that it was able to inhibit tumor growth in 30% of
the tumorgraft lines when tested at nanomolar, clinicallyrelevant concentrations [24, 25]. The identification and
validation in tumorgrafts of HHT provides a proof-ofprinciple for this screening strategy.

an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is inactivated in > 80% of all
ccRCCs [4, 5]. One consequence of VHL inactivation
is the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-2
alpha (HIF-2α) and subsequently, the upregulation
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which
leads to increased angiogenesis, a critical component
of tumorigenesis [6]. Additionally, mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a serine/threonine
kinase that is a key regulator of protein translation and
cell proliferation, is also activated in RCC [7, 8]. Recent
FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of ccRCC include
drugs that target effector pathways downstream of VHL
such as the VEGF pathway (bevacizumab, sorafenib,
sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the mTORC1 pathway
(temsirolimus and everolimus) [9]. Both temsirolimus
and everolimus are analogues of sirolimus (also called
rapamycin), and in patients temsirolimus is metabolized to
sirolimus, which accounts for 70% of the circulating drug
[10, 11]. While sequential use of these drugs has improved
outcomes, disease progression is typically only delayed
by a few months and most patients eventually develop
resistance to these drugs [12, 13]. The identification of
novel drugs (and/or drugs that synergize with existing
drugs) to treat ccRCC patients is therefore critical for
improved patient outcomes.
The concept of “synthetic lethality” is being
successfully exploited in the cancer field to identify drugs
that specifically target cancer cells while leaving healthy,
non-cancer cells unharmed [14-16]. Synthetic lethal drugs
often target functions that are essential for survival in
the presence of a gene mutated in cancer cells [15, 17].
Synthetic lethal chemical or RNAi screens performed
on cancer cell lines with a known mutation have been
successful in identifying such agents. For example,
synthetic lethal screens have identified Poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as being potentially
effective in treating breast and ovarian cancers that harbor
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations [18], and compounds that
are synthetic lethal with RAS mutations found in colon,
lung, and other cancers have also been identified via such
screens [19-21].
To identify small molecule drugs that exhibit
synthetic lethality with the VHL gene and thus could
potentially be widely applicable for the treatment of RCC,
we performed a high-throughput chemical screen. The
design of this cell-based screen included the following
important features: 1) It employed a VHL-mutant RCC
tumor cell line and an isogenic control reconstituted
with VHL. 2) The screen (involving mutant cells) and the
counterscreen (with the reconstituted cells) were carried
out simultaneously. This multiplexed screening strategy,
which was enabled by the differential labeling of the two
cell populations with distinctive fluorochromes, minimizes
confounding variables that can arise from sequential
screening, and more accurately replicates the in vivo
cancer setting where cancer cells are adjacent to normal

RESULTS
Novel platform to identify small molecule
compounds synthetic lethal with VHL mutation
To identify small molecule compounds synthetic
lethal with VHL, we carried out an unbiased cell-based
screen of a chemical library of ~12,800 compounds using
786-O cells, an extensively studied cell line derived from
a VHL-deficient primary human ccRCC [26]. 786-O cells
were stably transfected with either an empty vector (EV)
control or reconstituted with an HA-tagged VHL cDNA.
VHL reconstitution downregulated HIF-2α and GLUT1
as expected (Supplementary Figure 1A). To distinguish
between the two otherwise isogenic cell lines, we
transduced the VHL-deficient 786-O cells with a histone
H2B-GFP reporter and the VHL-reconstituted cells with
an H2B-mCherry reporter. The histone proteins drive the
fluorochrome to nuclei facilitating cell identification and
segmentation algorithms (Figure 1A and 1B). EV control
(EVGFP) and VHL-reconstituted cells (VHLmCh) were mixed
together 1:1 and dispensed into wells (Figure 1A and 1B).
It has been previously reported that 786-O cells
reconstituted with VHL grow at a similar rate in culture
as VHL-deficient parental cells (though there is a clear
growth difference in xenografts in vivo) [26]. As a similar
proliferation rate for both cell lines was critical to the
design and accuracy of our screen, we confirmed that
786-O VHLmCh cells grew at a similar rate as 786-O EVGFP

cells. After 3 days in culture (which corresponded to the
duration of the chemical compound screen), we observed
similar numbers of 786-O VHLmCh and 786-O EVGFP cells
(Supplementary Figure 1B).
A key advantage of this dual screen design is that the
screen and the counterscreen are conducted simultaneously
using a fluorescence-based readout, thereby maximizing
sensitivity and minimizing confounding variables that can

occur when screens are carried out at different times and in
different tissue culture plates. To determine the sensitivity
of our screening platform, we evaluated defined ratios of
VHLmCh and EVGFP cells using a BD Pathway 855 imager.
Small changes in cell population ratios (i.e. 90:10, 80:20,
etc.) were readily and accurately detected with the BD
Pathway imaging system (Supplementary Figure 1C).
However, statistical analysis of the signal readout versus

hours the chemical library was dispensed (final concentration of 5 µM) and cells cultured for 48 hours in the presence of 2 nM rapamycin.

the number of cells plated revealed a skewing toward the
GFP signal, such that any given percent of green value
read is likely to be 4.51±4.60 percentage points greater
than was plated. As this was found to be stable for each
ratio, and skewed in favor of the EVGFP cells, this should
not compromise the results of the screen, and in fact would
require a more stringent decrease of the EVGFP cells upon
drug treatment to indicate cell killing.

(Supplementary Figure 2A) at 5 µM in 40 384-well plates
with appropriate controls (Supplementary Figure 2A and
2B). The average Z’ score for the plates was 0.674 (+/0.072 standard deviation), which is an excellent signalto-noise value. A low concentration of sirolimus (2 nM)
was included in the screen, thus potentially allowing
for the identification of molecules that are synergistic
with sirolimus (which may lead to more effective
drug combinations). We chose sirolimus because it is a
first line treatment for ccRCC, and also because it acts
directly on the cancer cell as opposed to anti-angiogenic
drugs which act on endothelial cells. We identified 139
compounds that differentially depleted GFP-positive
(VHL-deficient) cells with ratios of EVGFP/VHLmCh lower
than 2 times the standard deviation of the mean ratio for

the library. Compounds that were highly toxic ( < 100
VHLmCh cells per well) were eliminated (n = 39) (Figure
1C). After visual inspection of the images from hit wells,
40 compounds were selected for further analyses. They
included 7 mixtures of natural compounds (natural
fractions), and among the remaining 33 compounds, 28
were reproducible and 15 had activity at concentrations
below 0.5 µM (Figure 1C). None of the compounds were
synergistic with sirolimus, and further analyses focused
on homoharringtonine (HHT), an NIH-approved drug [23]
that could be repurposed for ccRCC (Figure 1C).
At low nanomolar concentrations, HHT
preferentially killed VHL-deficient cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 2A). At 50 nM, 30-40% of the
VHL-deficient cells were killed by 36 hours. At the same
time point, fewer than 10% of VHL-reconstituted cells
were dead. At 100 nM, the number of dead VHL-deficient
cells reached 50-60%, but was less than 25% for the VHLreconstituted cells (Figure 2A). Importantly, 50 nM is a
concentration achievable in patients [24]. This effect was
independent of sirolimus (data not shown). Interestingly,
HHT induced apoptosis preferentially in VHL-deficient
cells: caspase 9 cleavage was observed at 50 nM and 100
nM HHT treatment within 12 hours in VHL-deficient cells,
but not in VHL-reconstituted cells (Figure 2B and data not
shown). Additionally, we found that Bcl-xL, a member
of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family whose expression has
been shown to be dependent upon VHL expression in the
context of chemically-induced hypoxia in 786-O cells
[27], was upregulated at 24 hours in HHT-treated VHLreconstituted but not VHL-deficient cells. Together these
data indicate that 50 nM HHT can effectively kill VHLdeficient 786-O cells, most likely by inducing apoptosis.

life increased to 2.8 h at the next dose level (0.7 mg/kg).
While this resulted in exposures that were higher than in
humans, HHT concentrations above 50 nM (equivalent
to 27.3 ng/mL; MW=545.6) were sustained for ~6 hours.
Given our in vitro studies, we sought to sustain 50 nM
drug levels and mice were dosed with 0.7 mg/ kg HHT
given by gavage twice daily.
We selected 6 independently-derived ccRCC
tumorgraft lines that were confirmed to have VHL
mutation. The mice (3-5 mice per tumorgraft line) were
treated with either HHT (0.7 mg/kg), vehicle (as a negative
control), or rapamycin (0.5 mg/kg; as a positive control).
In total, 65 tumorgraft bearing mice were evaluated for
these experiments in time courses lasting ~28 days, with
tumor growth measured every 3 or 4 days. Most lines
responded to rapamycin treatment, as expected (Figure
3A-3F).
Of the six lines tested, two tumorgraft lines, XP26
and XP144, showed observable inhibition of tumor growth
upon treatment with HHT (Figure 3A and 3E). For XP26
tumors, tumor growth (as measured by tumor volume) was
inhibited by 63.7% in HHT-treated mice in comparison to
vehicle treated mice, while in XP144 mice tumor growth
was inhibited by 43.0%. Tumors weights from HHTtreated XP26 and XP144 mice were 56% and 32% smaller,
respectively, than those from vehicle-treated mice (Figure
4A and 4B). As expected, we did not observe synergistic
effects between HHT and rapamycin in the tumorgrafts.
Although the HHT-treated mice maintained similar body
weight compared to controls (Figure 4C and 4D), they
did exhibit some signs of toxicity including rough coats
and lethargy (not shown). Histological analysis of the
tumors harvested from XP26 and XP144 cohorts revealed
that HHT treatment induced tumor cell necrosis (Figure
5A and 5B). Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections
of these tumors showed irregular geographic areas of
coagulative tumor necrosis with peripherally preserved
viable tumor cells and abundant karyorrhexis debris. In
addition, in XP144 a neutrophilic infiltrate was observed.
Intratumoral interstitial fibrosis was observed in areas with
less prominent necrosis (not shown). Similar findings were
observed in the rapamycin-treated tumors. In contrast,
vehicle-treated tumors showed compact nests of ccRCC
cells without necrosis.
Together, these data demonstrate that HHT can
inhibit tumor growth in a tumorgraft RCC model using
clinically-relevant regimens.

HHT is active against VHL-deficient RCC in
tumorgraft model
To determine whether HHT may have activity
against RCC, we evaluated its activity in a tumorgraft
model of RCC that we previously showed recapitulates
the histology, gene expression, and drug responsiveness
of human RCC [22]. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses
were first performed to determine the dosage required to
achieve plasma concentrations of ~50 nM HHT, which are
reached in the treatment of CML in patients [24, 25].
We evaluated PK parameters after administration of
a single dose of HHT by oral gavage to mice of 0.4 mg/
kg, 0.7 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg (Table 1). Cmax was reached at
10 minutes (first time point sampled) for the two lower
doses but increased to 1.5 hours at the higher 2 mg/kg
dose. Terminal t½ also increased with increasing dose.
Treatment with 0.4 mg/kg HTT by gavage most closely
approximated human exposures [25]. However, the halflife in humans, where it is dosed subcutaneously, was 7
h, whereas it was 1.86 h in mice (at 0.4 mg/kg). The halfwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Discussion
Herein, we report the identification, using a novel
screening platform, of a VHL synthetic lethal compound
active in a ccRCC cell line that we subsequently validate
in a state-of-the-art preclinical model. This establishes a
proof-of-principle for the screening strategy we developed.
The screen has several important features. First, the
16956

Oncotarget

synthetic lethal target, VHL, is inactivated in over 80%
of ccRCC, and therefore any compounds identified in
our screen have the potential to be broadly active against
ccRCC. Second, the screen and counterscreen are carried
out simultaneously, which limits confounding variables
from sequential screens. In addition, differential cell
labeling using fluorescently-tagged nuclear (as opposed
to cytosolic) proteins is optimal for cell segmentation
and offers excellent accuracy. Third, this platform has the
potential to identify not only synthetic lethal compounds,
but also molecules that are synergistic with other drugs,
such as rapamycin, which may lead to novel and more
efficacious drug combinations. (Although these types
of molecules may not be very abundant and we did not
identify any in our library). Fourth, the library includes
FDA-approved drugs as well as drugs in clinical trials,
which have been extensively characterized and could
be repurposed for other applications. Finally, coupling
of the screen with a validated tumorgraft platform

and PK analyses that ensure testing at clinicallyrelevant concentrations maximizes opportunities for the
identification of clinically-relevant compounds.
The identification of HHT in our screen
demonstrates that we can successfully find drugs that act as
synthetic lethal agents when combined with VHL mutation
using this strategy. HHT is a natural plant alkaloid derived
from the coniferous tree Cephalotaxus harringtonia that
has been reported to kill tumor cells by inducing apoptosis
[28-31]. We chose to follow-up on this compound for the
following reasons: 1) It offered the opportunity to evaluate
a drug that has been extensively characterized and could
be repurposed for renal cancer. HHT has been evaluated
primarily in CML, where it was shown to lead to both
major and complete cytogenetic responses [23, 32].
Following FDA approval of imatinib in 2001, efforts to
develop HHT for treatment of CML slackened [33], but
the development of a semisynthetic form of HHT and the
finding that it could be effective in imatinib-resistant CML

renewed clinical interest, eventually leading to its FDA
approval for CML [33]. 2) HHT killed VHL-deficient cells
in our tumorgraft models at concentrations achievable in
patients. 3) Only a small number of RCC patients have
been evaluated for HHT treatment: the only reported trial,
conducted in 1996, was a small phase II clinical trial in
14 patients with advanced ccRCC, and was halted due
to toxicity [34]. Thus, HHT efficacy against ccRCC has
not been adequately studied. 4) We were intrigued by the
observation that HHT inhibits protein synthesis [30, 35],
and by the possibility that VHL loss may synergize with
protein synthesis inhibitors [36]. 5) HHT penetrates the

blood-brain barrier [37], and may be active against brain
metastases, which are a challenge in renal cancer patients.
We found that HHT induced apoptosis in VHLdeficient ccRCC cells in culture but not in cells
reconstituted with VHL at 50-100 nM concentrations. In
the context of CML, studies have shown that HHT/ssHHT
most likely act by inhibiting protein synthesis, and also
by increasing apoptosis, in part by increasing turnover
of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), an anti-apoptotic
protein of the Bcl-2 family [29, 30]. Consistent with
this, we observed an increase in Caspase 9 expression in
HHT-treated 786-O cells, as well as morphologic tumor

necrosis. Additionally, the observation that the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL is not upregulated in our VHLdeficient cells may indicate a potential mechanism by
which HHT is synergizing with VHL mutation to kill the
VHL-deficient 786-O cells.
Subsequent studies in our tumorgraft model
showed that HHT effectively inhibits tumor growth in
2/6 tumorgraft lines tested, where it induced extensive
coagulative necrosis. The most likely explanation for the
lack of response in all the tumorgrafts is that the effect of
HHT is dependent on other factors besides VHL. While
our studies show that HHT preferentially kills VHLdeficient 786-O cells, we speculate that other factors in
both this cell line and the sensitive tumorgrafts determined
its responsiveness to HHT. Thus, while VHL loss appears
to be necessary (at least in ccRCC), it is not sufficient
for HHT activity. The existence of other factors that
determine HHT activity is clear based on its effectiveness
against CML, which lacks mutations in VHL. However,
our preclinical evaluation and validation of the synthetic
lethality of HHT with VHL mutation in two tumorgraft
lines represents proof-of-principle that this screening
strategy can successfully identify compounds that may be
useful clinically.
HHT represents the latest addition in synthetic lethal
screens for ccRCC. Previously, two other screens designed
to identify synthetic lethal interactors with VHL mutation
were reported: Bommi-Reddy et al. performed a shRNA
screen targeting 88 different kinases in 786-O and RCC4
cells, and identified three potential candidates (CDK6,
MET, and MAP2K1) [38]. And Turcotte et al. performed a
small molecule screen in VHL-deficient SN12C RCC cells
and identified a compound that induces autophagy [39].
We were able to validate our compound in a clinicallyrelevant tumorgraft model of ccRCC, which is an
important addition to prior screens. The identification of
HHT, an already FDA-approved drug, allows for relatively
fast and more cost-effective “repurposing” of the drug to
treat a different cancer type: ccRCC.

We screened roughly 12,800 small molecule
compounds, available through the UT Southwestern HighThroughput Screening Core (http://www.utsouthwestern.
edu/education/medical-school/departments/simmons/
shared-resources/high-throughput/lab.html), including
the Prestwick library of all FDA-approved drugs and the
NIH Collection of experimental drugs. Sixteen-hundred
cells of a 1:1 mixture of 786-O-EV;H2B-GFP (EVGFP)
cells and 786-O-VHL;H2B-mCherry (VHLmCh) cells were
plated using a Multidrop liquid dispenser (Thermo-Fisher
Scientific, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after the cells were
plated, the compound library was dispensed at a final
concentration of 5 µM using a Biomek FX liquid handler.
The screen was performed in the presence of a low
concentration of sirolimus (2 nM) that equally affected
VHL-deficient and VHL-reconstituted cells, and modestly
reduced cell proliferation. 48 hours later, the cells were
washed with PBS, stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 ug/mL
in PBS), fixed with formalin, and evaluated by the BD
Pathway 855 imager (Bectin-Dickinson, Inc.). Controls for
each plate included: 16 wells of GFP and mCherry cells
plated at (i) 1:1 ratio and (ii) 0.2:1 ratio (with and without
sirolimus).

Tumorgrafts
Tumorgrafts were generated and propagated as
described previously, with tumor samples implanted
subcutaneously into the flank of the mouse for drug trials
[42]. Briefly, 4- to 8-week-old NOD/SCID mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane and implanted subcutaneously
with 64 mm3 tumor fragments (cohorts 2-20). Once tumors
reached an average of at least ~250 mm3, drug treatment
was begun. The mice were treated with vehicle, 0.7 mg/
kg homoharringtonine (HHT) via gavage twice daily, or
0.5 mg/kg rapamycin given by IP injection once every 48
hours. Tumor size (volume) was measured twice weekly
and was obtained by multiplying tumor length, width, and
depth using calipers. To assess toxicity, mouse weight was
monitored once weekly.

786-O cells were purchased from ATCC. They
are a human ccRCC cell line and lack a functional VHL
gene [40]. The pcDNA-HA empty vector control plasmid
(EV; plasmid database p332) and the pcDNA-HA-VHL
plasmid (VHL; p333) were transfected into 786-O cells
with Lipofectamine reagent following manufacturer’s
instructions. The H2B-GFP (p585) and H2B-mCherry
(p584) retroviral constructs were transduced as previously
described [41].

Sections from tumors were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) as described previously [22].

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Female NOD/SCID mice (6-7 weeks) were
administered homoharringtonine (HHT) by oral
gavage. DMSO was used to wet the compound which
was subsequently diluted in normal saline (pH 7.2)

prior to administration (final DMSO < 5%). Animals
were sacrificed in duplicate by inhalation overdose of
CO2 at varying times post-dose and bled by cardiac
puncture using acidified citrate dextrose (ACD) as the
anticoagulant. Plasma was isolated after centrifugation at
9,600 x g for 10 minutes at 4oC. Protein was precipitated
from 100 µl of plasma with 100 µl of acetonitrile
containing 100 ng/ml of n-benzylbenzamide, which was
used as an internal standard (IS), and 0.2% formic acid.
After extensive vortexing, samples were incubated for 10
minutes at RT and spun twice at 16,100 x g for 5 minutes.
The supernatant was evaluated by LC-MS/MS using
a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) Prominence LC coupled
to an AB Sciex (Framingham, MA) 3200 Qtrap mass
spectrometer. Extraction conditions were optimized prior
to PK analysis for efficient and reproducible recovery over
a three log range of concentrations. Analytical standards
and quality control samples were prepared in a similar
fashion by spiking commercial CD-1 mouse plasma
(Bioreclamation, Westbury, NY) with known quantities
of HHT. Chromatography conditions were as follows: an
Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) C18 XDB, 5 micron packing,
50 x 4.6 mm size column was used for reverse phase
chromatography. Buffer A consisted of dH2O + 0.1%
formic acid and Buffer B consisted of methanol + 0.1%
formic acid. Gradient conditions utilized were: 0.01-1.0
min 3% B, 1.0-1.5 min gradient to 100% B,1.5-3.0 min
100% B, 3.0-3.1 min gradient to 3% B, 3.1-4.1 min 3%
B. HHT was detected as the 546.3 to 298.3 transition,
and the IS (n-benzylbenzamide) as the 212.1 to 91.1
transition. Data were analyzed using Analyst software
(AB Sciex.) A value 3x above the signal obtained in the
blank plasma was designated as the limit of detection
(LOD). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was defined as
the lowest concentration on the standard curve at which
back calculation yielded a concentration within 20%
of the theoretical value and above the LOD signal. The
LOQ for HHT was 0.5 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetic properties
were evaluated using the noncompartmental analysis tool
in WinNonlin (Certara, Corp., St. Louis, MO). Sparse
sampling was used for data analysis. Terminal half-life
was calculated as the ln(2)/λz where λz is a first order
rate constant associated with the terminal (log-linear)
portion of the curve. It is estimated by linear regression
of time vs. log concentration by the software for three
or more of the final nonzero data points. Tmax (time to
maximal drug concentration) and Cmax (maximal drug
concentration) were determined by visual inspection. Area
under the concentration time curve (AUCinf) from time 0
to infinity was determined by linear trapezoidal analysis.
Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) is based on the
terminal phase and is calculated as Dose/λz*AUCinf while
Apparent Clearance (CL/F) is calculated as Dose/AUCinf.
Calculation of Absolute Vz and CL requires knowledge
of oral bioavailability (F) which is calculated as AUCoral/
AUCiv X Dose iv/Doseoral but was not determined here

because an IV PK was not performed.

Reagents
Rapamycin (sirolimus) (LC Laboratories) was
dissolved in MeOH. Homoharringtonine was purchased
from Sequoia Research Products Limited. Hoechst
33342 (Life Technologies) was used at 2 µg/mL in PBS.
Antibodies: HA (1:1000; Covance), GLUT1 and HIF2α (1:1000; Novus Biologicals), Bcl-xL and Caspase
9 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and α-Tubulin
(1:5000; Sigma Aldrich).
