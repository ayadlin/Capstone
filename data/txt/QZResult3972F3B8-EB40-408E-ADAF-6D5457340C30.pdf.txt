BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors report the results of 39 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who were treated
with chemotherapy and high-dose rituximab-containing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) during their first disease remission. METHODS: The median age of the patients was 54 years. At the time of diagnosis, 87% of patients had Ann Arbor stage IV
disease, and 77% had bone marrow involvement. A Ki-67 level of > 30% was found in 11 of 27 patients (40%), and SOX11 (SRY [sex
determining region Y)-box 11] expression was found to be positive in 17 of 18 patients (94%). Twenty-seven patients (69%) underwent
induction therapy with high-dose cytarabine-containing chemotherapy. Rituximab was administered during stem cell collection at a
dose of 1000 mg=m2 on days 11 and 18 after ASCT. RESULTS: The estimated 4-year overall survival and progression-free survival
rates were 82% and 59%, respectively. Twelve patients experienced disease recurrence. Fifteen of 16 patients who were alive and in
complete remission at 36 months remained so at a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 38 months-145 months). The only determinant of recurrence risk found was a Ki-67 level of > 30%. Seven of 11 patients with a Ki-67 level > 30% experienced disease recurrence
within the first 3 years versus only 3 of 16 patients with a Ki-67 level  30% (P 5.02). Patients who received high-dose cytarabine did
not have a significantly different risk of developing disease recurrence compared with other patients (P 5.7). CONCLUSIONS:

INTRODUCTION
The 2008 World Health Organization classification system defines mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) as a B-cell neoplasm
with a CCND1 translocation.1 MCL has long been known for its chemoresistance, high rates of disease recurrence and
progression, and relatively short median survival rate. Poorer outcomes have been associated with advanced patient age
(> 65 years), leukemic phase, hepatosplenomegaly, advanced or bulky disease, poor performance status, anemia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and b-2 microglobulin levels.2,3
The MCL International Prognostic Index (MIPI) was recently introduced4; however, its prognostic significance
appears to depend on the treatment regimen.5-8 Blastoid or pleomorphic morphologic characteristics and a high proliferation index, the latter evaluated using either gene expression profiling or simple Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining, are also associated with a poor outcome.9,10 Most recently, SOX11 (SRY [sex determining region Y)-box 11]
expression in patients with MCL was reported to be a biological marker, with an absence of SOX11 expression found to
be associated in some studies with an indolent form of the disease, not requiring the immediate initiation of aggressive
chemotherapy.11,12

ASCT for SOX11-Positive MCL/Chakhachiro et al

Conventional chemoimmunotherapy for patients
with advanced MCL has led to improved outcomes but is
not curative.3,13 Multiple research groups have attempted
to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by consolidating
with early (during the first partial or complete remission)
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). In the prerituximab era, such strategies prolonged the first remission
to 3 to 4 years, but no cured patient subgroups were evident on long-term follow-up. However, with the incorporation of the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, the results
of ASCT appear to be superior.5 In 2009, we published
our results with frontline ASCT, both with and without
rituximab.5 After the initial posttransplantation period, it
became apparent that the natural history of patients
treated with rituximab differed from that of patients who
were not treated with rituximab, with the progression-free
survival (PFS) curves separating after 24 months. These
data suggested that long-term disease-free survival is possible. The small number of patients, however, precluded
firm conclusions or the analysis of predictors of outcome.
In this study, we combined a new group of patients
with the group reported previously to analyze the effectiveness of frontline ASCT with rituximab in patients
with MCL. We also assessed SOX11 expression and prognostic factors, including the Ki-67 index.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group

The current study includes all patients with MCL who
were treated in sequential phase 2 protocols at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston
between May 1, 1999 and October 31, 2010, and who
had received rituximab as part of their conditioning regimen before ASCT was administered during their first
remission. Twenty-one of these patients have been
reported previously.5 Eligibility criteria included patients
aged 70 years a Zubrod performance status score of 2,
and no uncontrolled active infection or symptomatic
organ dysfunction; in addition, patients were required to
have chemosensitive disease. All eligible patients had
biopsy-proven MCL, supported by the results of ancillary
studies,14 and all provided informed consent.
Historical Control Group

Thirty patients with newly diagnosed MCL who had been
treated with hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) and ASCT, but not rituximab, at the study institution between 1994 and 1996
formed the historical control group in the current study.

These patients were reported previously5 and were retrospectively compared with the patients in the study group.
Transplantation Strategy

Transplantation strategy has evolved over the past several
years. For patients in their first remission after chemotherapy, ASCT had been performed as consolidation therapy
before 2001.5 After 2001, and because of the reported
favorable clinical outcomes after chemotherapy with
rituximab and hyper-CVAD (R-hyper-CVAD), ASCT
was performed during the first remission in patients who
had not experienced a complete response (CR) after
R-hyper-CVAD and those who had undergone less intensive induction chemotherapy (eg, R-CHOP [rituximab
and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
prednisone]).
Preparative Regimens, Stem Cell Collection,
and Autologous Stem Cell Infusion

The details of the study patients’ stem cell collection,
preparative regimens, supportive care, and infections have
been previously published.5 Patients received rituximab
during stem cell collection, as previously described, with
rituximab administered at a dose of 375 mg=m2 on the
day before chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization and
again at a dose of 1000 mg=m2 7 days later.5 Patients
received an additional dose of 1000 mg=m2 of rituximab
on days 11 and 18 after ASCT. The predominant ASCT
preparative conditioning regimens in this study group
were rituximab, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and
melphalan and rituximab, high-dose cyclophosphamide,
and total body irradiation, which were used in 77% and
23% of patients, respectively.
Patients were evaluated 1 month, 3 months, 6
months, and 12 months after ASCT; every 6 months for
up to 5 years; and yearly thereafter. Responses were scored
using standard criteria for patients with lymphoma.15,16
SOX11 and Ki-67 Immunohistochemical Analysis

At the time the patients were treated, SOX11 and Ki-67
were not evaluated routinely for all cases of MCL. For the
current study, we performed immunostaining for these
markers retrospectively, collecting all initial diagnostic
pretransplantation material when unstained slides were
available. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
biopsy sections were assessed using heat-induced antigen
retrieval and by immunohistochemical analysis using
anti-SOX11 rabbit polyclonal (dilution of 1:1500)
(Abcam, Cambridge, Mass) and anti-Ki-67 (dilution of
1:100) (Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) monoclonal antibodies.
For SOX11 controls, we used a tissue microarray that

included 13 cases of MCL as well as full tissue sections
from 1 MCL case. Two cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma=chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving the
lymph nodes served as negative controls for SOX11
immunostaining.
For analysis of Ki-67 results, the entire slide was
evaluated and representative areas with uniform staining
were selected. The number of positive cells was assessed
semiquantitatively in intervals of 10% as follows: < 10%,
10% to < 20%, 20% to < 30%, 30% to < 40%, etc. In
addition, Ki-67 was analyzed in 17 cases as part of an earlier study by manually counting up to 1000 cells per case.
There were no discrepancies found between the semiquantitative estimate and the manual count in this subset
of cases. The percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was the

but not mandatory. All available initial and follow-up molecular and cytogenetic data were reviewed and analyzed.
Statistical Analysis

Actuarial overall survival (OS) and PFS rate estimates
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.18 OS
was estimated from the date of transplantation to the date
of death or last follow-up. PFS was estimated from the
date of transplantation to the date of disease recurrence or
death in disease remission. The incidence of disease progression was estimated using the cumulative incidence
method. Predictors of outcome were assessed using the
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. P values
< .05 were considered to be statistically significant.19

Cytogenetic and Molecular Status

We tested patients’ bone marrow for the presence of immunoglobulin H (IgH)-CCND1 fusion indication of
t(11;14)(q13;q32) using fluorescence in situ hybridization or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).17
Conventional cytogenetic analysis was also performed at
the time of diagnosis in a subset of patients. Assessment
was performed at the time of diagnosis and follow-up was
performed before and after ASCT, which was encouraged

The study group comprised 39 patients. Patients’ pretransplantation characteristics and demographics are summarized in Table 1. Patient age ranged from 38 years to
73 years, with a median age of 54 years. Thirteen patients
(33%) were aged > 60 years. All had advanced disease at
the time of diagnosis: 34 patients (87%) had stage IV disease, 30 patients (77%) had bone marrow involvement,
and 14 patients (36%) had involvement of the gastrointestinal tract. The MIPI score was 0 to 2 in 18 patients
(46%), 3 or 4 in 12 patients (31%), and  5 in 6 patients

(15%). Induction chemotherapy consisted of R-hyperCVAD alternating with R-methotrexate and high-dose
cytarabine in 27 patients (69%) and R-CHOP in 12
patients (31%). Ten patients (26%) had tumors with blastic morphologic features. Before transplantation, CR (or
unconfirmed CR) was achieved in 25 patients (64%); 14
patients (36%) experienced a partial response, and
6 patients (15%) had undergone a positron emission
tomography-positive scan. For patients treated with
R-hyper-CVAD, 6 patients (22%) were treatmentresistant and did not experience a CR after 6 t0 8 cycles.
Patients in the control and study groups were similar
with regard to age and baseline characteristics (Table 1),
including sex distribution, serum lactate dehydrogenase
levels, gastrointestinal tract and blood involvement, and
MIPI score. However, more patients in the study group
had blastic features (P 5 .01), an elevated b-2 microglobulin level (P 5 .002), and an IPI > 1 (P < .001). In
addition, more patients in the control group received
high-dose cytarabine as their induction chemotherapy
compared with the study group (P 5 .01) (Table 1). Only
5 patients in the control group had been tested for Ki-67
and none was tested for SOX11.

SOX11

We performed immunohistochemical analysis for SOX11
retrospectively using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue sections from 18 patients for whom diagnostic material was available. Seventeen of 18 tumors (94%) were
positive for SOX11 expression. The biopsy specimens
that were positive for SOX11 were obtained from the
lymph nodes (n 5 7), gastrointestinal tract (n 5 5), bone
marrow (n 5 4), and testis (n 5 1) (Fig. 1).
The single SOX11-negative case also could be considered equivocal. This was a small gastrointestinal tract
biopsy specimen with limited tumor involvement and
scattered positive cells.

Survival and Effect of Ki-67 on the Risk of
Disease Progression

All patients in the study group experienced a CR after
ASCT with rituximab. The median follow-up interval for
surviving patients was 38 months (range, 11 months-145
months). The estimated 4-year OS and PFS rates were
82% (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.61-0.92) and
59% (95% CI, 0.39-0.75), respectively. Twelve patients
3321

Original Article

experienced disease recurrence; 11 occurred within 3 years
of ASCT, with a clear plateau emerging after 3 years.
On univariate analysis, the only determinants that
were found to be predictive of an increased risk of disease
recurrence were blastoid morphologic features (P 5 .05)
and a Ki-67 level of > 30% at diagnosis (P 5 .02) (Fig.
2A). Blastoid features were also found to be highly correlated with Ki-67 levels; 7 of 10 patients with blastoid features had a Ki-67 level > 30% and 13 of 16 patients
without blastoid features had a Ki-67 level  30%
(P 5 .01). Because of sample size limitations, the independent effects of blastoid features and Ki-67 level could
not be assessed on multivariate analysis. Seven of 11
patients with a Ki-67 level > 30% experienced disease recurrence within the first 3 years versus only 3 of 16
patients with a Ki-67 level  30%. The only other single
recurrence noted within the first 3 years occurred in
patients with unknown Ki-67 levels.
None of the factors listed in Table 1 was found to be
significantly associated with an increased rate of disease recurrence, including the MIPI score (analyzed by low vs
intermediate-to-high levels and stratified levels of 0-2 vs 3
or 4 vs  5), IPI, age > 60 years, disease status at the time
of transplantation (CR vs partial response), or conditioning regimen.
Comparison With the Control Group

Thirty patients underwent ASCT without rituximab in
the historical control group. All patients had undergone
hyper-CVAD induction chemotherapy without rituximab. The median follow-up period in this group was 145
months (range, 62 months-187 months). The OS and
PFS rates at 145 months (the last follow-up date in the
study group) were inferior to those in the study group
(OS rate of 14% [P 5 .06] and PFS of rate 7% [P 5 .03]).
The rate of disease recurrence for patients in the
study group was comparable to that for those in the control group during the first 36 months after transplantation, despite the inclusion of 6 patients in the study group
who did not experience a CR after 6 to 8 cycles of
R-hyper-CVAD. However, differences in the recurrence
rate became evident after 36 months (Fig. 2B). Only 1 of
16 patients in the study group who were alive and in CR
at 36 months subsequently developed disease recurrence
(3 months later); the remaining patients were alive and in
remission at a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 38
months-145 months). This pattern was in stark contrast
to the patients in the control group who did not receive
rituximab, in which 11 of 15 patients experienced a disease recurrence after 36 months at a median of 74 months

(range, 41 months-148 months) (hazard ratio, 4.9;
P 5 .02 compared with patients treated with rituximab at
the 3-year landmark).
The contribution of the Ki-67 percentage to disease
progression in the group not treated with rituximab could
not be fully assessed because adequate pathological material was available for only 5 patients; all had a Ki-67 level
of  30%. One of these 5 patients experienced an early
death secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. Three of the
remaining 4 patients experienced late disease recurrence at
40 months, 60 months, and 128 months, respectively.
One patient remained alive and in disease remission at
 187 months after transplantation.
Prior Exposure to High-Dose Cytarabine and
Outcome

Patients who did not receive prior high-dose cytarabine
with their induction chemotherapy were not found to be
at risk for disease recurrence compared with other patients
(P 5 .7). The 3-year PFS rate in patients who underwent
induction with high-dose cytarabine before ASCT with
rituximab was 62%, which was similar to that in patients
treated with rituximab who did not receive high-dose

cytarabine (66%; P 5 .7) (Fig. 2C). All patients in the
control group received high-dose cytarabine; their PFS
rate at 3 years was 50%, which was not statistically different from the other 2 groups at 3 years (P 5 .3). However,
the curves later separated to reach statistical significance
(P 5 .04) when comparing the patients treated with highdose cytarabine in the study and control groups.
Molecular and Cytogenetic Status

Nine patients in whom t(11;14)=IgH-CCND1-positive
cells were detectable by PCR at the time of ASCT were
followed with subsequent testing. Seventy-one samples
were collected at 1 month to 9 years after transplantation
(Fig. 3). Two patients who were found to be positive on
PCR at 1 month, 4 months, and 14 months, respectively,
experienced disease recurrence. All other patients
remained in continuous molecular remission.
DISCUSSION
We previously demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to conditioning regimens in patients treated with
ASCT can induce a progression-free plateau in a subset of
patients with MCL.5 The current study, which is
3323

Original Article

supported by a larger number of patients and a longer
follow-up period, provides confirmation of our findings
from 2009.5 Most impressively, no cases of disease recurrence occurred after 39 months, despite the inclusion of
patients who were resistant to the R-hyper-CVAD regimen. The quality of this remission is attested to by the
persistent PCR negativity in 7 patients who were prospectively tested for up to 9 years after undergoing ASCT.
Disease recurrences continued to occur in patients
treated with ASCT who had not received rituximab. This
finding contrasts with our findings in such patients. This
continuous pattern of disease recurrence was also observed
in the updated results of the Nordic MCL2 trial,7 in
which rituximab was used during stem cell collection but
not immediately after transplantation, as we did for
patients with minimal residual disease. In that trial, rituximab was used preemptively after ASCT in patients who
had evidence of molecular disease recurrence from dormant clonal cells or malignant cells that had escaped in
vivo purging during stem cell collection. The dose and
schedule of rituximab in ASCT administered to patients
with B-cell lymphoid malignancies appear to be important. Studies have suggested that higher doses20 or more
doses21,22 of rituximab may increase the response rate in
patients with lymphoma. CD20 is not expressed by hematopoietic stem cells, and we demonstrated that treatment
with higher doses of rituximab at 1000 mg=m2 would not
inhibit engraftment produced by these early progenitors.
We previously reported improvements in ASCT for
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,23 similar to
the those reported in the current study. These observations warrant further evaluation in prospective, randomized trials.
The treatment of MCL is nonstandardized. To the
best of our knowledge, recent updates with 10 years of
follow-up after intense conventional chemotherapy have
not demonstrated a survival plateau.3 It was reported
recently that a subset of patients with MCL requires observation only and that these patients may not require
therapy until they become symptomatic.24 These observations highlight the potential for selection bias in singlecenter series. SOX11, a transcription factor that is normally involved in embryonic neurogenesis, has been
found to be overexpressed in patients with MCL.11,12,25
The significance of a lack of SOX11 expression remains
controversial. However, in at least 2 studies, a lack of
SOX11 expression was linked to indolent forms of
MCL.11,12 To address the potential selection bias in the
current study, we retrospectively analyzed SOX11 expression in 18 patients with MCL for whom we had available
3324

tissue. In 17 patients, SOX11 was expressed by MCL with
a nuclear pattern. In 1 patient, the SOX11 results were
equivocal but were considered to be negative for the current study. In this patient, only a small gastrointestinal
tract biopsy specimen with limited tumor was available
for analysis. The biopsy specimen did have some scattered
tumor cells with SOX11 overexpression. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to analyze SOX11 in
patients with MCL who are undergoing ASCT.
Disease recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure after ASCT. As such, we analyzed the risks of recurrence and found that a proliferation index (Ki-67) > 30%
was the only determining factor. Ki-67 expression has
been found to be an important prognostic marker in
patients with MCL.7,9,10 Using a quantitative image analysis, Schaffel et al26 suggested that a 30% proliferation
index is an optimal cutoff. In the patient group in the current study, those patients whose tumors had a Ki-67 level
> 30% also had a high risk of disease recurrence. Ki-67
distribution was found to be similar in patients who
underwent pretransplantation induction chemotherapy
with R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and R-hyper-CVAD, suggesting
that high Ki-67 levels are an adverse prognostic marker,
even in patients treated with aggressive chemotherapy
before ASCT. We believe that Ki-67 levels should be routinely evaluated in all patients with MCL.
The results of recent studies suggest that ASCT is
associated with a higher survival rate in patients with
MCL if it is preceded by cytarabine-containing induction
chemotherapy.27 In the current study, similar outcomes
were observed in patients receiving R--CVAD=high-dose
cytarabine or R-CHOP. We detected no difference in Ki67 distribution between these 2 groups. This finding confirms the results that were recently published by Budde
et al.6
We acknowledge the limitations of the current
study. The small number of patients in this series and the
absence of a prospective control group preclude firm conclusions regarding the prognostic significance of the MIPI
score. In addition, it was difficult to determine whether
the lower rate of disease recurrence in the study group
compared with the control group was because of rituximab or a difference in Ki-67 distribution, because
adequate pathological material for testing was only available for 5 patients in the control group. All 5 tested
patients in the control group were found to have low Ki67 levels, and the study group included patients who were
resistant to R-hyper-CVAD; more patients in the study
group had blastoid tumors, elevated b-2 microglobulin

levels, and an IPI > 1, suggesting that the improvement
was related to the use of rituximab.
In conclusion, ASCT with rituximab given during
stem cell collection and immediately after transplantation
may induce continuous long-term remissions in a substantial subset of patients with MCL who responded to
induction chemotherapy, with improved results compared with historical controls not receiving rituximab.
The dose and schedule of rituximab in patients treated
with ASCT need to be studied in randomized trials. An
elevated Ki-67 level appears to be the most significant determinant of disease recurrence. Innovative strategies are
needed to treat these patients. At the study institution, we
offer allogeneic stem cell transplantation to patients with
MCL with a high Ki-67 index.
