In this study, loss of expression of the fragile site-encoded Wwox protein was found to contribute to radiation and cisplatin
resistance of cells, responses that could be associated with cancer recurrence and poor outcome. WWOX gene deletions occur in a
variety of human cancer types, and reduced Wwox protein expression can be detected early during cancer development. We found
that Wwox loss is followed by mild chromosome instability in genomes of mouse embryo ﬁbroblast cells from Wwox-knockout
mice. Human and mouse cells deﬁcient for Wwox also exhibit signiﬁcantly enhanced survival of ionizing radiation and bleomycin
treatment, agents that induce double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cancer cells that survive radiation recur more rapidly in a xenograft
model of irradiated breast cancer cells; Wwox-deﬁcient cells exhibited signiﬁcantly shorter tumor latencies vs Wwox-expressing
cells. This Wwox effect has important consequences in human disease: in a cohort of cancer patients treated with radiation, Wwox
deﬁciency signiﬁcantly correlated with shorter overall survival times. In examining mechanisms underlying Wwox-dependent
survival differences, we found that Wwox-deﬁcient cells exhibit enhanced homology directed repair (HDR) and decreased nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, suggesting that Wwox contributes to DNA DSB repair pathway choice. Upon silencing of
Rad51, a protein critical for HDR, Wwox-deﬁcient cells were resensitized to radiation. We also demonstrated interaction of Wwox
with Brca1, a driver of HDR, and show via immunoﬂuorescent detection of repair proteins at ionizing radiation-induced DNA
damage foci that Wwox expression suppresses DSB repair at the end-resection step of HDR. We propose a genome caretaker
function for WWOX, in which Brca1–Wwox interaction supports NHEJ as the dominant DSB repair pathway in Wwox-sufﬁcient cells.
Taken together, the experimental results suggest that reduced Wwox expression, a common occurrence in cancers, dysregulates
DSB repair, enhancing efﬁciency of likely mutagenic repair, and enabling radiation and cisplatin treatment resistance.

INTRODUCTION
The FRA16D locus at 16q23 is a common fragile site that forms
gaps or breaks upon replication stress and is altered in many
human cancers, showing up to 52% loss of heterozygosity in
breast tumors.1 The 1.2 Mb WWOX gene is located within this
fragile region,2 and reduced Wwox protein expression has been
correlated with breast cancer progression and poor prognosis.1
Mouse models conﬁrm a tumor suppressor function for Wwox, as
complete knockout mice on various genetic backgrounds was
postnatal lethal.1,3 In addition, Wwox haploinsufﬁcient mice, with
a mammary tumor-susceptible C3H background, exhibit increased
mammary gland tumorigenicity4 and re-expression of Wwox
decreases tumor burden in ovarian and breast cancer
xenografts.5,6
Recently, FRA16D has been identiﬁed as the most active
common fragile site in epithelial cells7 and large cancer copy
number alteration studies identiﬁed WWOX as the third most
commonly deleted gene across human cancers.8,9 Despite
many lines of evidence that suggest a role for loss of Wwox
in the progression of cancer,10 our understanding of Wwox

tumor-suppressive function is incomplete. Wwox protein exhibits
distinct structural domains, two adjacent N-terminal WW proteinbinding domains and a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase
(SDR) domain in its central region believed to have a role in
steroid hormone metabolism2,11 and cellular respiration.12 The
ﬁrst WW domain binds proteins with a PPxY or PPxL motif and
many interactors have been identiﬁed, including p73, Ap2γ,
ErbB-4, Smad3 and ATM,5,13–16 associated with induction of
apoptosis, regulation of proliferation, interaction with extracellular
matrix and checkpoint activation. Wwox functional interaction
with these proteins has provided thus far the main clues for the
role of Wwox in the prevention of cancer development.
In this study, we further examined the role of Wwox deﬁciency
in cancer progression, speciﬁcally in the context of DNA damage.
Our initial observation that Wwox-knockout mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) showed increased allele copy number gains and
losses relative to wild-type MEFs led us to hypothesize that Wwox
protein exhibits a genome caretaker function, suppressing
mutations. We show that loss of Wwox expression signiﬁcantly
alters usage of all four double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways,

suggesting a role for Wwox in pathway choice. Enhanced
homology directed repair (HDR) in Wwox-deﬁcient cells permits
signiﬁcantly increased resistance to cisplatin and radiation
treatment-associated cell killing, a ﬁnding with clinical implications. Finally, we delineate a caretaker function for Wwox in DSB
repair pathway choice, and propose its dependence on interaction
with Brca1 protein.
RESULTS
Wwox-knockout MEFs exhibit chromosomal alterations and
shared CNVs
To determine if Wwox contributes to genome stability, karyotype
and copy number variation (CNV) analyses were carried out using
Wwox-knockout and -wild-type MEF cell lines. Karyotype analysis
of three cell lines (two knockout and one wild type, established
from Wwox-knockout mouse models described previously3,17)
showed near tetraploidy with chromosomal losses and gains
(Supplementary Figure 1). Both knockout MEFs exhibited two
structural abnormalities not present in the wild-type cell line: del
(7)(A1B4) and del(4)(C4). Loss of the distal arm of chromosome
4 encompasses the murine Cdkn2a gene, encoding p16, a locus
frequently deleted in human cancers and in cultured cells.18
Hemizygous del(7)A1B4 encompasses 48.5 Mb and 4650 genes.
CNVs, deﬁned as allele gains or losses spanning 410 kb in size,
were assessed in DNAs of MEFs from two distinct Wwox-knockout
mouse models and compared with DNAs from corresponding
wild-type littermates (cell line pairs, KO5/WT4 from Wwoxknockout17 and Wwox5/Wwox3 from a different Wwox-knockout
mouse model3). CNVs were detected through array comparative
genomic hybridization. Three distinct deletions were shared by
the two knockout MEF lines at chromosome locations 1 H6, 4 B3
and 8 C2 (Tables 1a and b).
The karyotype and CNV results suggest that absence of Wwox
protein is associated with mild genome instability, likely stemming
from endogenous DNA damage, prompting our hypothesis that
Wwox participates in protecting the genome from damage.
We ﬁrst considered whether Wwox loss leads to uninduced
genome damage (i.e., damage not due to exposure to exogenous
cytotoxic agent), but the comet assay, which detects DSBs as
comet tails, and immunoﬂuorescence assays for DSB markers,
53BP1 and γH2AX, did not reveal differences in untreated Wwoxdeﬁcient and -expressing cells (Supplementary Figure 2).
Wwox-deﬁcient cells exhibit increased survival of ionizing
radiation-induced DSBs
To determine if Wwox expression may affect repair of induced
DSBs, we investigated the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) on
various Wwox-deﬁcient vs -sufﬁcient cells. Early-passage MEFs
were exposed to increasing IR doses up to 10 Gy, and plated for
clonogenicity to quantify cell survival and proliferation. We
observed a signiﬁcant difference (Po 0.01) in survival at doses
7.7 Gy and above (Figure 1a), with knockout lines KO3 and KO5
surviving 10-fold better than wild-type cell lines WT4 and WT7.
Similarly, survival curves for transformed breast epithelial cell line,
MCF10A clones stably transduced with Wwox silencing shRNAs,
shWWOXA and shWWOXB,15 demonstrated increased survival at
7.7 Gy and above (Po 0.05) vs the Wwox-sufﬁcient Scr RNAtransfected cells (Figure 1b). To determine if Wwox loss has a
similar effect in cancer cells, we used MDA MB-231 breast
adenocarcinoma cells lacking endogenous Wwox expression,
which had been stably transduced with a doxycycline-inducible
Wwox expression vector.15 Wwox-induced cells that were treated
with doxycycline for 24 h and were positive for Wwox are denoted
as 231/Wwox-pos throughout the manuscript, whereas these
Wwox-deﬁcient cells untreated with doxycycline are referred to as
231/Wwox-neg. Clonogenicity assays of these cells showed that
Oncogene (2017) 2215 – 2227

induced Wwox expression led to reduced survival at 5.1 Gy
(Figure 1c; P o0.05), the highest dose at which 231/Wwox-pos
cells formed colonies. The shWWOXA and shWWOXB cells were
also treated with the radiomimetic, bleomycin, a glycopeptide
antitumor antibiotic that induces DSBs, and strikingly signiﬁcant
differences in survival were observed; the Wwox-silenced cells
survived bleomycin treatments 25-fold better at 1 and 1.5 μg/ml
bleomycin and 100-fold better than Wwox-expressing MCF10A
cells at 3 μg/ml bleomycin (P o 0.01) (Figure 1d). To conﬁrm that
enhanced survival was because of the absence of Wwox, we
established clones KO3A and KO5F from the knockout MEF cell
lines KO3 and KO5, which were doxycycline inducible for the
expression of Wwox. Upon Wwox induction, both clones exhibited
signiﬁcantly decreased survival (P o 0.05) at 7.7 Gy and above
(Figures 1e and f), conﬁrming that Wwox expression sensitizes
cells to radiation.
Wwox expression inhibits growth of irradiated cancer cells in vivo
To determine if the IR resistance of Wwox-deﬁcient cells persists
in vivo, Wwox-induced (231/Wwox-pos) and Wwox-deﬁcient
(231/Wwox-neg) breast cancer cells were tested for tumor growth
in immunocompromised mice. The rationale was that despite
irradiating the same number of cells for the two groups, more
231/Wwox-neg cells would survive IR, forming tumors more
quickly than 231/Wwox-pos cells (Figure 2a). Both groups of cells
were exposed to 5 Gy IR, immediately harvested and injected
(1 × 107 cells per mouse) subcutaneously into the ﬂanks of athymic
nude mice. Control mice from each group were unexposed to IR
and exhibited mean tumor latencies (days from injection to ﬁrst
sign of tumor) that were not different: 11 days for 231/Wwox-neg
cells and 14 days for 231/Wwox-pos cells. For mice receiving
irradiated cells, 7/8 mice injected with 231/Wwox-neg cells formed
tumors, whereas 6/8 mice injected with 231/Wwox-pos cells
formed tumors. Of the tumor-bearing mice, those injected with
231/Wwox-neg cells had signiﬁcantly shorter tumor latencies
(mean 17 days) vs mice receiving 231/Wwox-pos cells (mean
28 days) (Figure 2b; P o 0.05).
Next, we sought a human cancer database with expression and
clinical data for cancers treated with radiation to determine if loss
of Wwox enabled tumor cell resistance to radiation and decreased
overall patient survival in a human model. As we did not ﬁnd
publicly available breast cancer databases with sufﬁcient
clinical data or patients treated with radiation, we examined brain
cancers via the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data
(REMBRANDT).19 Stratiﬁcation of patients by Wwox expression did
not predict overall survival in a large cohort of brain cancer
patients (Figure 3c); however, in cancers treated with radiation,
reduced Wwox expression correlated signiﬁcantly with decreased
overall survival vs Wwox normal cancers (Figure 3d), suggesting
that loss of Wwox facilitates resistance to radiation therapy,
disease recurrence and shorter overall survival. Collectively, results
of the xenograft model and the brain cancer assessment conﬁrm
that Wwox loss supports radiation resistance in vivo and that
Wwox deﬁciency provides a survival advantage to cancer cells
carrying DSBs.
Wwox expression regulates DSB repair pathway choice
To elucidate the mechanism that underlies Wwox deﬁciency
associated radiation resistance, we hypothesized that loss of
Wwox could enhance DSB repair. Although there are four DSB
repair pathways, two pathways predominate: non-homologous
end-joining (NHEJ), which bluntly re-ligates DSB ends independent of sequence homology, or HDR, which prevails in S and G2
cell cycle phases and uses sister chromatids as templates for
accurate DSB repair.20 To assess the HDR pathway in the presence
or absence of Wwox, we used the direct repeat-green ﬂuorescent
protein (DR-GFP) reporter construct21 that has been stably

integrated into HeLa cells22 and U87 cells.23 Repair of the DR-GFP
construct via HDR is measured as the fraction of GFP-positive cells.
Wwox-sufﬁcient U87 cells transfected with siWwox and I-SceI
revealed a 2.5-fold increase in HDR (P o 0.01) vs control cells
transfected with siCtrl and I-SceI (Figure 3a). To conﬁrm Wwox
speciﬁcity, we performed a rescue experiment in the U87 DR-GFP
cells by transfecting siWwox (directed toward Wwox 5′-untranslated region) simultaneously with a full-length Wwox expression
plasmid, myc-Wwox.13 When Wwox expression levels were
restored in the presence of siWwox, we observed decreased
HDR, similar to HDR efﬁciency of Wwox-sufﬁcient cells (Figure 3a).
As further conﬁrmation that Wwox deﬁciency increases HDR
efﬁciency, transfection of endogenous Wwox-deﬁcient HeLa DRGFP cells with myc-Wwox resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease
(P o 0.05) in HDR (Figure 3b). Thus, the DR-GFP assays consistently
showed that Wwox expression suppressed HDR.

As HDR and NHEJ have both been implicated in resistance to
radiation,24,25 we next assessed the contribution of Wwox to NHEJ
efﬁciency using 293/HW1 cells. Following induction of DSBs and
silencing of Wwox, NHEJ is measured by real-time PCR using a
probe that spans the junction of the break sites.26 In 293/
HW1 cells, silencing Wwox signiﬁcantly decreased NHEJ by 50%
(P o 0.05) (Figure 3c), indicating that, unlike HDR, Wwox expression enhanced NHEJ.
As Wwox expression signiﬁcantly altered the efﬁciencies of the
predominant DSB repair pathways HDR and NHEJ, we also sought
to determine the consequences of Wwox loss on the less
common, more error-prone pathways: alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ)
and single-strand annealing (SSA). Both are mutagenic and result
in deletions initiated by 5′ to 3′ resection from the DSB site up to
microhomologous regions.27 Alt-NHEJ efﬁciency was assessed in

I-SceI transfection. We observed a marked, statistically signiﬁcant
(P o 0.0001) decrease in Alt-NHEJ (Figure 3d) upon transfection
with siWwox and I-SceI. This effect was conﬁrmed in a rescue
experiment where siWwox and myc-Wwox simultaneously cotransfected with I-SceI restored Wwox expression and signiﬁcantly
increased Alt-NHEJ (Po 0.001), indicating that Wwox expression
signiﬁcantly enhanced Alt-NHEJ. To evaluate the effects of Wwox
on SSA repair, Wwox-deﬁcient HeLa Sa26 cells29 were transfected
with I-SceI plus either empty vector or myc-Wwox (Figure 3e) and
% GFP-positive cells were assessed. Upon Wwox expression, SSA
in HeLa Sa26 cells was markedly repressed (P o0.01) to less than
one-third, demonstrating that Wwox expression signiﬁcantly
repressed SSA. Altogether, the data indicate that Wwox expression
signiﬁcantly alters repair efﬁciency for all four DSB repair pathways
(summarized in Figure 3f) such that Wwox expression enhances
NHEJ and Alt-NHEJ, but impairs HDR and SSA.
Enhanced HDR in Wwox-deﬁcient cells results in resistance to
radiation and cisplatin
Although HDR and SSA repair are both elevated in Wwox-deﬁcient
cells, we hypothesized that HDR was responsible for the observed
radiation resistance. To verify that Wwox-deﬁcient cells survive IRinduced DSBs because of enhanced HDR, we inhibited HDR via
transient knockdown of Rad51, a critical protein for HDR-speciﬁc
strand invasion. As expected, knockout MEFs transfected with
siCtrl RNAs (solid lines, Figure 3g) exhibited signiﬁcantly increased
survival (P o 0.001) compared with wild-type MEFs, but following
Rad51 depletion (dashed lines), knockout MEFs had survival curves
Oncogene (2017) 2215 – 2227

similar to wild-type cells. Thus, HDR inhibition signiﬁcantly
decreased survival after radiation (Po 0.001) only for Wwoxknockout MEFs, conﬁrming that increased HDR underlies the
radiation resistance of Wwox-deﬁcient cells.
As alterations in DSB repair pathway efﬁciencies would affect
responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents, we next
investigated the effect of Wwox expression on sensitivity to
cisplatin, a crosslinking chemotherapeutic agent that causes DSBs.
We hypothesized that Wwox-deﬁcient cells would be more
resistant to cisplatin vs Wwox-sufﬁcient cells because their
enhanced HDR would resolve DSBs induced by cisplatin more
efﬁciently. Indeed, treatment of 231/Wwox-neg cells with various
doses of cisplatin revealed enhanced survival to cisplatin
treatment at 10 μM in 231/Wwox-neg vs 231/Wwox-pos cells
(P o 0.01) and at higher doses (Figure 3h). Similarly, knockout
MEFs survive cisplatin at 25 μM (P o 0.001) and higher concentrations vs WT4 MEF (Figure 3i). Thus, the dysregulation of DSB repair
pathways and subsequent enhanced HDR associated with Wwox
deﬁciency results in cellular resistance to the commonly used
breast cancer therapeutic agents: radiation and cisplatin. Given
that cellular loss of Wwox encourages therapy resistance, we next
sought clues to the mechanism involved in Wwox protein
suppression of HDR.
Cell cycle phase distribution in IR-treated Wwox-pos and -neg cells
As HDR is thought to occur mainly in S and G2 phases of the cell
cycle where a sister chromatid is available as repair template,20 we
considered whether cell cycle phase distribution and checkpoint

activation differences might contribute to increased HDR and
radiation resistance in Wwox-deﬁcient cells. Flow cytometric
analysis in 231/Wwox cells, regardless of induced Wwox
expression, showed nearly identical cell cycle phase distributions (Figure 4a), with accumulation in G2/M by 10 h postirradiation (Figure 4b), although 231/Wwox-neg cells appeared
to have stronger activation of pChk2 and pChk1 (Supplementary
Figure 3). Similar experiments in early-passage (~ p10) Wwoxknockout and -wild-type MEFs revealed differences for the wildtype and knockout cells in cell cycle phase distribution
(Figure 4c) and checkpoint activation (Figure 4d), neither of
which activities showed correlation with the responses of the
cells to IR (Supplementary Figure 4). Results of the cell cycle
analyses of MEFs and 231/Wwox cells demonstrated that the
differences in cell cycle kinetics among various Wwox-pos and
-neg cells did not account for the differences in responses to
IR exposure.

Brca1 and Wwox proteins form a complex
Given the multiple protein interactors for Wwox, we hypothesized
that Wwox interaction with a protein(s) in the HDR pathway might
underlie its role in DSB repair pathway choice. Brca1 was a
candidate interactor as it contains a PPxL Wwox-binding motif at
amino acid 981 and promotes HDR over NHEJ repair by initiating
DSB end resection.30 To investigate a potential interaction
between Wwox and Brca1, we performed GST pulldown experiments using GST fused to various Wwox constructs in human
embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells transfected with
hemagglutinin-Brca1 (HA-Brca1) (Figure 5a). A schematic of the
Wwox domains is presented in Figure 5c. GST fused to wild-type
full-length Wwox bound HA-Brca1 and was detected by anti-HA
antibody (Figure 5a, lane 7). Similarly, GST fused to the WW
domain fragment (WW1 and 2, lane 3) bound HA-Brca1; however,
the WW domain fragment with mutated WW1 (W44F/P47A),31
which renders the binding domain non-functional, did not bind

HA-Brca1 (lane 4), suggesting that Wwox interaction with Brca1
occurs through the WW1 domain. In support of this, a WW domain
with mutated WW2 (Y85A/P88A in lane 5) pulls down HA-Brca1,
indicating that WW2 is not essential for the interaction; ﬁnally,
a GST-fused SDR fragment did not bind HA-Brca1 (lane 6) and
does not contain either WW domain.
To conﬁrm the Brca1–Wwox interaction, we transfected
HEK293T cells with HA-Brca1 plus full-length, myc-tagged Wwox

plasmid (myc-Wwox) and performed immunoprecipitation using
anti-HA and detection with anti-Brca1 (Figure 5b). HA-Brca1 pulled
down myc-Wwox (detected by anti-Wwox), whereas immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoprecipitation did not detectably bind either
protein.
Next, to determine which Brca1 domain was participating in the
Wwox interaction, we transfected ﬁve Brca1 mutants, harboring
deletions from the N to C terminus (Figure 5d), into MDA MB-231

cells with myc-Wwox. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with
anti-HA to avoid detecting interactions because of the low-level
endogenous Brca1 protein expressed in the MB-231 cells. The HA

antibody precipitated Wwox in lysates harboring Brca1 deletions
at the N, M3 and C regions (lanes 6, 9 and 10; Figure 5e) but not in
lysates expressing Brca1 with the M1- and M2-deleted regions

(lanes 7 and 8; Figure 5e). These interactions were conﬁrmed in
the opposite direction, in HEK293T cells transfected with mycWwox plus each of the Brca1 deletion mutants (Supplementary
Figure 5). Immunoprecipitation using Myc antibody as bait
revealed that all Brca1 deletion mutants except M1 and M2
detectably bound myc-Wwox (lanes 6–10; Supplementary
Figure 5), suggesting that sequences within the Brca1 aminoacid 305–1292 region are responsible for the Wwox–Brca1
interaction.
Wwox interaction with Brca1 through the WW domain is
responsible for decreased survival of DSBs
To conﬁrm whether interaction with Brca1 through the WW
domain is responsible for suppression of HDR and sensitivity to
DSBs, the MDA MB-231 cells were stably transfected with
doxycycline-inducible full-length Wwox harboring WW1
mutations31 W44F/P47A (231/WW1 mut) or full-length Wwox
harboring a mutation (Y293F) at the catalytic SDR site (231/SDR
mut) and performed clonogenicity assays following increasing
doses of IR. These cells are denoted as 231/WW1 mut-pos and
231/SDR mut-pos when treated with doxycycline for 24 h and
expressing the full-length Wwox with WW1 or SDR mutation.
Conversely, 231/WW1 mut-neg and 231/SDR mut-neg cells
express only very low levels of endogenous Wwox. We inferred
that if Wwox interaction with Brca1 was critical for suppression of
HDR and sensitivity to DSBs, the cells expressing Wwox WW1
mutant would show no difference in IR survival with or without
induction, that is, they would both respond as if Wwox-neg,
whereas cells induced to express the Wwox SDR mutant, which
maintains a functional WW1 domain, would be IR-sensitive.
Supplementary Figure 6b demonstrates the inducibility of Wwox
expression in these cell lines. As predicted, Figure 5f shows that
231 cells expressing a non-functional WW1 mutant Wwox protein
(231/WW1 mut-pos) exhibit an IR survival curve similar to the
same cells uninduced for Wwox (231/WW1 mut-neg). This
suggests that without a functional WW1 domain, Wwox does
not sensitize cells to radiation. Conversely, upon expression of fulllength Wwox harboring an SDR mutant, the cells exhibit
signiﬁcantly decreased survival relative to the same cells
uninduced (Figure 5g); that is, the SDR mutant Wwox-expressing
cells are sensitive to radiation because they retain a WW1 domain,
which interacts with Brca1.
Loss of Wwox expression leads to signiﬁcant increases in
radiation-induced nuclear Rpa32 and Rad51 foci
As Brca1 forms complexes comprised of varying interacting
proteins and these complexes have distinct functions during
DSB recognition and repair, we sought to understand how Wwox–
Brca1 might enhance NHEJ and suppress HDR, through immunoﬂuorescent detection of critical DSB repair-associated proteins:
γH2AX, 53BP1, RIF1, Brca1, Rad51 and Rpa32 (Figure 6). These
proteins form foci at DSBs upon irradiation and are involved in

DSB recognition, repair pathway choice and end resection
(Figures 7a and b). Brieﬂy, γH2AX detects DSBs and recruits
53BP1/RIF1 complex, which protects DSB ends and promotes NHEJ.
However, in the S phase, Brca1 is abundant and complexes with the
endonuclease CtIP, displaces 53BP1/RIF1 and promotes end
resection through interaction with the MRN complex composed
of Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1. DSB end resection commits cells to HDR
or SSA. The resulting single-stranded DNA is coated with replication
protein A and subsequent formation of Rad51 nucleoﬁlament
initiates strand invasion for HDR.
To quantify the accumulation of repair proteins at DSBs,
the number of positive foci per nucleus were determined in
231/Wwox-pos and 231/Wwox-neg cells following 10 Gy IR as
indicated in Figure 6. We observed a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in γH2AX foci at 3 h after IR in 231/Wwox-neg cells
compared with 231/Wwox-pos cells, likely reﬂecting the more
time-consuming repair process associated with HDR vs rapid
NHEJ. There were no signiﬁcant differences in foci of RIF1, 53BP1
or Brca1 proteins at 0, 1, 3 and 6 h after IR, suggesting that Wwox
interaction with Brca1 does not interfere with recruitment of Brca1
to DSBs and displacement of the 53BP1/RIF1 complex. However,
Rpa32 and Rad51 showed signiﬁcantly increased foci in
231/Wwox-neg cells compared with 231/Wwox-pos cells 1 h after
IR. Increased Rpa32 foci indicate that 231/Wwox-neg cells exhibit
enhanced DSB end resection; therefore, we hypothesize that
Wwox interaction with Brca1 suppresses DSB end resection in
Wwox-sufﬁcient cells, ultimately promoting NHEJ over HDR.
DISCUSSION
We have established a role for Wwox in the regulation of DSB
repair, such that Wwox-deﬁcient cells exhibit enhanced HDR and
survival of DSB-inducing agents. We also reveal a novel interaction
of Wwox protein with Brca1, the genome caretaker that mediates
HDR repair of DSBs and hypothesize that Wwox suppresses HDR
through its interaction with Brca1, tipping the pathway choice
to NHEJ repair. Unlike a recently reported interaction between
Wwox and the kinase, ATM,16 the interaction of Wwox with Brca1
appears not to be dependent on DNA damage. Our
co-immunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed that Wwox may
interact with Brca1 near the 981PPLF984 motif as Brca1 mutants
lacking amino acids 305–1292 did not bind Wwox. Therefore, we
propose that in Wwox-sufﬁcient cells, Wwox binds Brca1, directly
or indirectly, along this central region, competing with other
Brca1-interacting proteins critical for promoting HDR. One
candidate, Rad50, a component of the MRN complex, binds Brca1
at amino acids 341–758.32 This interaction is responsible for
stimulating nuclease activity of CtIP and MRN to enable end
resection, which commits cells to HDR or SSA. We offer a model
(Figure 7c) that proposes Wwox competes with Rad50 for binding
to Brca1 and subsequently impairs end resection in Wwoxsufﬁcient cells. In this way, Wwox deﬁciency, which commonly
occurs in cancer cells, lacks an inhibitory regulatory step, resulting

in enhanced end resection and HDR repair, ultimately enabling
the cells to survive DNA damage-inducing cytotoxic treatments.
With this delineation of a role for Wwox in DNA repair pathway
choice, we have established that Wwox is a genome caretaker,
apparently paradoxically, through its role in supporting NHEJ
repair, an imperfect pathway. If Wwox is involved in genome
caretaking how can it be that the absence of Wwox pushes
cells toward HDR, the presumptive pathway of choice for best
repair, and in this case, the pathway to increased survival cellular
survival of severe induced DNA damage? We believe that the
enhancement of HDR because of Wwox absence is mutagenic in

Wwox-deﬁcient cells based on the cell cycle analysis data
(Figure 4), which demonstrates that Wwox expression does not
affect cell cycle phase. This implies that although HDR is
enhanced, it is not restricted to S or G2 phases of the cell cycle
in Wwox-deﬁcient cells. If HDR should occur in the G1 phase, when
sister chromatids are unavailable, the homology search may take
place across the entire genome, increasing opportunities for
mutagenesis because of inappropriate pairing.33 In addition, we
have shown that loss of Wwox signiﬁcantly alters the efﬁciencies
of the remaining DSB repair pathways (summarized in Figure 3f),
impairing NHEJ and Alt-NHEJ, but enhancing SSA, a mutagenic

repair pathway that typically generates large deletions with no
insertions.27 As the DSB repair pathways are complex and
interconnected, it is difﬁcult at this point to assign speciﬁcally
the mutational burden or consequences of Wwox dysregulation to
individual altered repair pathways following DNA damage.
However, the chromosomal instability and large deletions
observed through karyotype and CNV analysis associated with
Wwox loss supports the idea that Wwox deﬁciency is mutagenic.
As loss of Wwox has been well documented in association with
the progression of numerous human cancers cancers,1,10 we
propose that long-term, Wwox-deﬁcient cells carry a higher
mutational burden despite short-term cellular survival of DNA
DSBs because of enhanced HDR.
Our ﬁndings have important, broad therapeutic implications as
Wwox is among the most commonly deleted genes in a wide variety
of common human cancers.1,8,9,34 We propose that determining
Wwox expression levels could be an important predictor of response
to radiation, cisplatin and possibly other chemotherapeutic agents.
Stratifying cancers by Wwox expression could allow physicians to
determine whether particular cancers would be good candidates for
radiation and perhaps also inform the dosage of DSB-inducing
treatments. Most importantly, we show that selectively inhibiting the
HDR pathway in Wwox-deﬁcient cells abolishes their radioresistance
and resensitizes them to radiation, suggesting the use of HDR
inhibitors in conjunction with radiation for treatment of Wwoxdeﬁcient tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement and xenograft
Animal experiments were in accordance with the ‘Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals’ of the National Institutes of Health and the
Ohio State University IACUC Protocol 2014A00000017. A total of 10
athymic nude female mice (JAX stock no. 007850) were injected at 8 weeks
of age with 1 ×107. Positive control mice (n = 2) received unirradiated cells,
whereas experimental mice (n = 4 for each group) received cells exposed
to 5 Gy. There were two groups of experimental mice: Group no. 1 received
231/Wwox-pos cells and Group no. 2 received 231/Wwox-neg cells.

Cell lines

Transient transfections
The MDA MB-231 cell line with doxycycline-inducible Wwox lentiviralbased system was described previously15 and is referred to as 231/Wwox.
For transient knockdowns, mouse MEFs WT4, WT7, KO3 and KO5 were
transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting Rad51 or a nonspeciﬁc
control small interfering RNA using standard Dharmacon protocol
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA).

Clonogenicity
Clonogenicity assays were performed as described.35 Cells were harvested
immediately after exposure to IR and 4 h following exposure to MMC, 24 h
after ABT-888 and 2 h after bleomycin treatment. Survival (%) was calculated
based on plating efﬁciencies of cells with no exposure to treatment.

DSB repair assays
To assess HDR, two cell lines with DR-GFP-stable integrations were used:
HeLa cells,22 which are Wwox-deﬁcient, and U87 cells,23 which are Wwoxsufﬁcient. The NHEJ experiment was performed in Wwox-sufﬁcient HEK293
cells with stably integrated NHEJ substrate, HW1. HDR, NHEJ, Alt-NHEJ and
SSA assays were performed as described previously.22,26 Wwox-deﬁcient
HeLa cells were transfected with 300 ng of myc-Wwox plasmid, empty myc
vector or myc-Wwox+siWwox where the myc-Wwox plasmid is resistant to
silencing by the small interfering RNAs. Wwox-sufﬁcient cell lines, U87,
HEK293 and H1299 cells, were transfected with siWwox or scrambled
control small interfering RNAs (Dharmacon).

Immunoblot and co-immunoprecipitation assays
For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (TFS, Waltham,
MS, USA) supplemented with Halt Protease Cocktail Inhibitors (TFS) or
when detecting Brca1, and lysed with low salt NP40 buffer as described.26
When transfecting plasmids, ~ 75–85% conﬂuent cells were overlayed with
a mixture containing 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 12 μl Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) in 200 μl Opti-Mem and the medium was
changed 4–6 h later. Cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation 24 h
later. Approximately 20 μg of antisera was used in binding of protein baits for
co-immunoprecipitation: Brca1,37 Wwox,38 myc,39 HA40 or HA (Covance,
Princeton, NJ, USA) and IgG (SCBT; no. 2025) (Supplementary Table 1).
GST pulldown with Wwox-wild-type GST-fusion protein and Wwox derivatives
was performed as described previously.31 The GST-WW domain fragments
harbored mutations at W44F+P47A (WW1) and Y85A+P88A (WW2).

Human brain cancer analysis (REMBRANDT)

MEFs were isolated from individual 13-day embryos of Wwox+/+ and
Wwox−/− mixed background (B6 × 129 SvJ) strain pregnant females and
designated MEF WT4, WT7, KO3 and KO5 cell lines. They were cultured
in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 μg/ml gentamicin and established as described.35 Wwox3 (Wwox+/+)
and Wwox5 (Wwox− / −) MEFs have been described.3 Breast cancer cell line,
MDA MB-231, and Wwox-inducible derivatives were maintained under
standard conditions. The MCF10A cell line and Wwox stably silenced
clones, shWWOXA and shWWOXB, have been described previously.15
Supplementary Figures 6a and b shows relative Wwox expression of cell
lines used throughout the manuscript.

Brain cancer expression data and patient clinical data were accessed
through Georgetown Database of Cancer (https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/
gdoc/). Two patient groups were created: group 1, detailed in
Supplementary Table 2 and depicted in Figure 2c, was made up of all
brain cancer patients who had both clinical data and expression data,
whereas group 2, detailed in Supplementary Table 3 and depicted in
Figure 2d, was composed of patients from group 1 who were treated with
radiation. Kaplan–Meier plots were generated through the KM Clinical Plot
application, a fold change of 2 was used to designate patients as
downregulated Wwox expression.
