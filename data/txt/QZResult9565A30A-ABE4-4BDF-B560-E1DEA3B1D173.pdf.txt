ABSTRACT
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis promotes survival and is a frequently mutated
pathway in cancer. Yet, inhibitors targeting this pathway are insufficient to induce
cancer cell death as single agents in some contexts, including diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). In these situations, combinations with inhibitors targeting BCL2 survival proteins (ABT-199 and ABT-263) may hold potential. Indeed, studies have
demonstrated marked synergy in contexts where PI3K/mTOR inhibitors suppress
expression of the pro-survival protein, MCL-1. In this study, we use BH3 profiling to
confirm that BCL-2 and BCL-XL support survival following PI3K pathway inhibition, and
that the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 strongly synergizes with BCL-2 antagonists
in DLBCL. However, we identify an alternative mechanism of synergy between PI3K/
mTOR and BCL-2 inhibitors, independent of MCL-1 down-regulation. Instead, we
show that suppression of AKT activation by BEZ235 can induce the mitochondrial
accumulation of pro-apoptotic BAD and BIM, and that expression of a constitutively
active form of AKT prevents sensitization to BCL-2 antagonism. Thus, our work
identifies an additional mechanism of synergy between PI3K pathway inhibitors
and BCL-2 antagonists that strengthens the rationale for testing this combination in
DLBCL.

INTRODUCTION

limit the cytotoxic potential of PI3K inhibitors despite
high pathway activity correlating with poor prognosis
[7, 8]. Residual mTOR signaling in cells treated with
selective PI3K inhibitors may also contribute to resistance
[9]. These observations suggest that PI3K inhibitors or
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may synergize with BCL-2
antagonists in GCB-DLBCL.
The potential of simultaneously inhibiting the
PI3K pathway and BCL-2 survival proteins has been
previously demonstrated in several contexts [10-12]. In
DLBCL sublines that are selected for resistance to the
BCL-2 inhibitors ABT-199/737, dual PI3K/mTOR or
mTOR selective inhibitors strongly enhance the efficacy
of BCL-2 antagonism [13, 14]. In all these contexts, a
decrease in MCL-1 expression, via mTORC1 inhibition
[15], has been cited as the primary mechanism of synergy
between PI3K and BCL-2 inhibitors. However, the PI3K
pathway has several other survival outputs, particularly
from AKT [16, 17], that may elicit similar drug synergy

PI3K inhibitors have recently received increased
attention in blood cancers, where an inhibitor of the p110δ
catalytic isoform (idelalisib) elicits significant patient
responses in both chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
and indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [1]. However,
more aggressive blood cancers such as diffuse large B cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) may not respond to monotherapy
with inhibitors targeting this network [2], highlighting the
need to identify novel therapeutic interventions for this
disease. The answer may be rational combinations. Indeed,
in the activated B cell (ABC) subtype, the combination
of PI3K pathway inhibitors with the BTK inhibitor,
ibrutinib, has shown some promise [3, 4]. However,
despite its efficacy in ABC-DLBCL, this combination
fails to effectively kill the germinal center subtype (GCB)
[4]. In this context, it is possible that elevated expression
of BCL-2, a hallmark of the GCB subtype [5, 6], may

between PI3K pathway inhibitors and BCL-2 antagonists
in GCB-DLBCL cells. Additionally, the effect of these
drug combinations on normal lymphocytes has not yet
been explored.
To gain insight into survival signaling in GCBDLBCL, we used BH3 profiling to identify any changes
in the relative balance of BCL-2 family proteins following
PI3K pathway inhibition [18]. This analysis revealed that
DLBCL cells become more dependent on BCL-2 and/
or BCL-XL for survival in the absence of PI3K pathway
activity. In accord, our data show that the combination
of PI3K pathway and BCL-2 inhibitors synergistically
induce apoptosis in a panel of GCB-DLBCL cell lines,
with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition providing the greatest
effect. Importantly, we also demonstrate synergy
between PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 inhibition in chemoresistant DLBCL lines over-expressing BCL-2, but
show that this combination lacked toxicity in normal
T lymphocytes. Contrary to other tumor cell contexts,
MCL-1 expression in GCB-DLBCL cells did not decrease
following PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Instead, treatment
with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors resulted in a significant
accumulation of the pro-apoptotic factors BAD and BIM
at the mitochondria. These effects were dependent on
suppression of AKT activity, as a constitutively active
mutant of AKT opposed the synergy between PI3K
pathway inhibitors and BCL-2 antagonists. These findings
identify a promising combination approach to achieve
selective GCB-DLBCL death, and highlight a previously
unpredicted mechanism of synergy.

mTOR axis. For each class of inhibitor, we compared
the effects of two chemically distinct compounds to limit
the contribution of off-target effects (Table 1). Using the
minimum dose of the inhibitors required to completely
inhibit their intended nodes (Supplemental Figure 1A),
we confirmed that PI3K pathway suppression had little
effect on viability in three GCB-DLBCL cell lines (OCILY1, OCI-LY8, SU-DHL4; Supplemental Figure 1B).
Instead, all inhibitors caused an accumulation of cells in
the G1 phase (Supplemental Figure 1C), suggestive of a
cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, response.
Despite lacking single-agent cytotoxicity, PI3K
pathway inhibitors can synergize with BCL-2 antagonists
by priming cells for undergoing apoptosis [10-13]. Thus,
we used BH3 profiling to measure the relative balance
of apoptotic proteins following inhibition of the PI3K
pathway in two GCB-DLBCL cell lines [18]. All PI3K
pathway inhibitors significantly increased mitochondrial
priming in these cell lines, as indicated by enhanced
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
by the BIM, PUMA, and BAD peptides (Figure 1A, 1D
and Supplemental Figure 2A). Interestingly, we did not
observe a significant change in sensitivity to the NOXA
peptide, a readout for MCL-1 modulation (Supplemental
Figure 2A). Nevertheless, these data suggest that PI3K
pathway inhibitors can prime DLBCL cells for undergoing
apoptosis.
The heightened sensitivity to the BAD peptide
(Supplemental Figure 2A) suggested that GCB-DLBCLs
have an increased dependence on BAD-specific antiapoptotic factors (e.g. BCL2 and BCL-XL) to maintain
survival following PI3K pathway inhibition. Consistent
with this interpretation, previous studies have shown that
increased sensitivity to the BAD peptide correlates with
higher efficacy of the dual BCL-2/BCL-XL antagonist,
ABT-737 [29]. Indeed, combined PI3K and BCL-2/
BCL-XL inhibition killed significantly more DLBCL cells
compared to single-agent treatments (Figure 1B, 1E). In
addition, the degree of enhanced apoptosis correlated
strongly with the extent of BIM-induced MOMP
(Figure 1C, 1F). Collectively, these data confirm that
PI3K pathway inhibition suppresses survival signaling

Among the classes of PI3K pathway inhibitors used,

the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, BEZ235 and GDC-0980,

Combined PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 inhibition
spares normal T cells

Supplemental Figure 2B, 2C). Thus, we focused further
experiments on the effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
Using the median-effect method [30], we confirmed that
combining BEZ235 and ABT-263 demonstrated formal
synergy in both OCI-LY1 and SU-DHL4 cell lines (CI
< 1, Supplemental Figure 3). To confirm the induction
of apoptosis, we co-treated DLBCL cells with the pancaspase inhibitor, Q-VD-OPh [31], which rescued the
death effects of BEZ235 and ABT-263 (Figure 1H). We
further confirmed that the combination induced doseand time-dependent cleavage of caspase 3, caspase 9,
and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP, Supplemental
Figure 4), indicative of an activated apoptosis pathway.
Cleavage of caspase 8 also occurred concurrently with
caspase 3 cleavage, and may be the result of a positivefeedback loop [32]. Together, these data suggest that the
combination of dual PI3K/mTOR and a BCL-2/BCL-XL
inhibitor significantly enhances the induction of apoptosis
in DLBCL cell lines relative to single agent treatment.

To facilitate the use of therapies combining dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with BCL-2 antagonists, it is
necessary to consider both the efficacy and tolerability
of these drugs in a preclinical setting. By inhibiting
BCL-XL, ABT-263 results in the on-target toxicity of
thrombocytopenia [33]. However, this is not observed
with ABT-199, a compound that selectively inhibits BCL2 [34]. The lack of a significant change in sensitivity to
the Hrk peptide (Supplemental Figure 2A) suggested
that BCL-XL inhibition was dispensable for the observed
synergy between ABT-263 and BEZ235. Thus, we
evaluated whether the efficacy of ABT-199 could also
be enhanced by the addition of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
While ABT-199 was approximately 10-fold more potent
than ABT-263 on a molar basis, the effects of both
BCL-2 inhibitors at a sub-maximal concentrations were
significantly enhanced by the addition of either BEZ235
or GDC-0980 in two DLBCL cell lines (Figure 2A). This

CD19 prior to assessing viability of lymphocyte subtypes by 7-AAD dye exclusion. Cells in the CD4- CD19- gate are mostly CD8+ T cells
and natural killer cells. All data are shown as mean ± SD. Significance was calculated using a paired two-tailed student’s t test. *P < 0.05,

Chemo-resistant DLBCL cells over-expressing
BCL-2 remain sensitive to BEZ235 with ABT-199

suggests that suppression of BCL-2 alone is sufficient for
synergy.
To further evaluate the tolerability of this
combination, we determined whether it also kills normal
circulating human lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T
cells, whose preservation can mediate anti-tumor immune
responses and improve treatment responses [35, 36]. We
isolated PBMCs from normal human donors and treated
the cells with BEZ235 and either ABT-199 or ABT-263.
In agreement with previous work [33], treatment with
either BCL-2 antagonist alone for 48 hours was sufficient
to eradicate normal B cells (CD19+ fraction) at low doses
(Figure 2B). However, at doses of ABT-263 and ABT199 that synergized with BEZ235 in OCI-LY1 cells,
there was no significant effect on the viability of CD4+
T cells (Figure 2B). Importantly, the addition of BEZ235
did not further enhance the cytotoxicity of ABT-199
in CD4 T cells. Together, these data suggest that while
the combination of BEZ235 and ABT-199 or ABT-263
synergistically kills both malignant and normal B cells, it
does not affect normal peripheral T cells.

Overexpression of BCL-2 is associated with chemoresistance, particularly in GCB-DLBCL [5, 37]. Thus,
to determine whether the combination of ABT-199 and
BEZ235 could efficiently eliminate cells that over-express
BCL-2, we used a two vector doxycycline-inducible
system to ectopically express BCL-2 in both OCI-LY1
and SU-DHL4 cells (Figure 3A). While excessive overexpression of BCL-2 was toxic (via cleavage to a proapoptotic isoform, data not shown), modest increases in
BCL-2 expression were sufficient to induce resistance to
the chemotherapeutic agent, vincristine, in both cell lines
(Figure 3B). As expected, this increased BCL-2 expression
also reduced sensitivity to ABT-199 as a single agent
(Figure 3C). Nevertheless, BEZ235 retained its capacity
to enhance the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines
(Figure 3C). Thus, combined treatment of BEZ235 and
ABT-199 can efficiently kill BCL-2 over-expressing cells
that are resistant to vincristine.

BCL-2 (n = 3). C. OCI-LY1 and SU-DHL4 cells were pre-treated with doxycycline (25 ng/ml or 1 µg/ml, respectively) for 24 hours prior

Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition does not affect
MCL-1 expression in DLBCL cell lines

We considered two possibilities to explain the
observation that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition did not
reduce MCL-1 protein expression. First we tested
the possibility that BEZ235 does not suppress capdependent translation in DLBCL cells. However, a dualluciferase reporter assay in OCI-LY1 cells confirmed that
BEZ235 significantly reduced cap-dependent translation
(Supplemental Figure 5C). In addition, BEZ235 reduced
the rate of total protein translation in two DLBCL cell
lines as measured using a puromycin incorporation
assay (SUnSET [43], Supplemental Figure 5D). Next
we addressed whether MCL-1 was aberrantly stabilized,
as mutations in MCL-1 may confer increased protein
stability [44]. Treatment of four GCB-DLBCL lines with
cycloheximide confirmed the half-life of MCL-1 to be
approximately 90 minutes (Supplemental Figure 5E), in
agreement with previous studies [44]. These data suggest
that MCL-1 protein level is not regulated by the PI3K/
mTOR network or cap-dependent translation in these
DLBCL cell lines.
To further assess whether MCL-1 could contribute
to the synergy between BEZ235 and BCL-2 antagonists,
we tested whether modulating MCL-1 expression could
alter the efficacy of the combination. Using three lentiviral
shRNA constructs, we knocked down expression of
MCL-1 in OCI-LY1 cells (Supplemental Figure 6A)
and confirmed that reduced MCL-1 expression was
sufficient to sensitize these cells to ABT-263 to a similar

Previous studies have revealed a critical role for
MCL-1 in modulating sensitivity to BCL-2/BCL-XL
antagonists [38-41]. Moreover, suppression of mTORC1dependent translation has been shown to reduce the levels
of MCL-1 and sensitize various cancer cells, including
ABT-199 resistant DLBCL, to BCL-2 antagonists [1013]. Thus, to examine whether mTORC1 inhibition could
suppress MCL-1 expression in these DLBCL cell lines, we
treated them with either BEZ235, MLN0128, or PIK-75
(a compound that suppresses MCL-1 transcription [42])
and measured MCL-1 levels over time by immunoblot.
Surprisingly, treatment with BEZ235 or MLN0128
did not reduce expression of MCL-1 despite efficient
suppression of both AKT and mTORC1, whereas PIK-75
fully suppressed MCL-1 expression by 8 hours (Figure 4A
and Supplemental Figure 5A, 5B). In contrast, BEZ235
strongly suppressed expression of MCL-1 in a human
leukemia cell line (BV173) and in ABT-199-resistant
SU-DHL6 cells (Figure 4A) [13]. However, BEZ235
failed to suppress MCL-1 in matched parental SU-DHL6
cells (Figure 4A). Collectively, these data suggest that
PI3K/mTOR or selective mTOR kinase inhibitors do not
suppress MCL-1 expression in parental GCB-DLBCL cell
lines.

Figure 4: BEZ235 does not affect MCL-1 expression in OCI-LY1 cells. A. OCI-LY1 (DLBCL), BV173 (B-cell acute

extent as BEZ235 (Figure 4B). However, the addition of
BEZ235 further enhanced ABT-263 killing (Figure 4B),
consistent with a model in which BEZ235 likely primes
for apoptosis through an alternative mechanism. To
determine whether uncoupling MCL-1 translation from
regulation by mTORC1 could rescue from the synergy,
we expressed of a form of MCL-1 lacking its endogenous
5’ UTR (Supplemental Figure 6B) [15]. Despite conferring
resistance to ABT-263, ectopic expression of MCL-1 was
insufficient to abolish the synergy between BEZ235 and
ABT-263 in several DLBCL cell lines (Figure 4C). Thus,
despite the clear influence of MCL-1 expression levels on
ABT-263 sensitivity, suppression of PI3K/mTOR likely
synergizes with BCL-2 antagonists through a non-MCL1-dependent mechanism.

we used immunoprecipitation to assess whether BEZ235
could increase the binding of BIM to BCL-2. BEZ235
increased both the total abundance of BIM as well as its
direct binding to BCL-2 (Figure 5C), suggesting that the
endogenous levels of BCL-2 are sufficient to preserve
cell survival following PI3K pathway inhibition by
sequestering BIM. However, the addition of ABT-199
displaced BIM from BCL-2 (Figure 5C) resulting in a net
increase in un-bound BIM and induction of apoptosis [47].
These results are in agreement with the observed increase
in sensitivity to the BAD peptide (Supplemental Figure
2A), which suggested that cells become more dependent
on BCL-2 following treatment with BEZ235. In addition to
changes in BIM expression, the reduction of cytoplasmic
phospho-BAD (S136), and concomitant increase in the
mitochondrial abundance of BAD, also support a model of
increased dependence on BCL-2 following PI3K pathway
inhibition (Figure 5A). Mitochondrial accumulation
of BAD is likely a result of its binding to BCL-2 [48],
suggesting that BAD may amplify the effect of BIM upregulation by limiting the amount of free BCL-2 that
can counteract BIM. Together, these data suggest that
inhibition of PI3K/mTOR by BEZ235 enhances the effect
of BCL-2 antagonists by increasing the abundance of BIM
and BAD at the mitochondria.

PI3K pathway inhibition increases mitochondrial
localization of BAD and BIM
Other than suppressing mTORC1-dependent
translation of pro-survival factors (e.g. MCL-1 and BCLXL), inhibition of the PI3K pathway also affects the
expression of several other BCL-2 family proteins [45].
Importantly, some BCL-2 family proteins are regulated
by their subcellular localization [46], prompting us
to examine the abundance of BCL-2 family proteins
specifically at the mitochondria. This analysis revealed
a significant increase in the mitochondrial abundance of
pro-apoptotic BAD and BIM following PI3K pathway
inhibition (Figure 5A, 5B). To confirm that these increases
were functionally relevant in priming cells for apoptosis,

Inhibition of AKT is required for apoptotic
sensitization in DLBCL cell lines
Previous work has established that both BAD and
BIM can be regulated in part by AKT [49]. Thus, to test

whether sustained activation of AKT could abolish the
synergy between PI3K pathway inhibitors and BCL-2
antagonists, we used a doxycycline-inducible system
to express a phosphomimetic mutant of AKT (S473D).
Expression of this mutant not only elevated basal AKT
activity as indicated by increased phosphorylation of
AKT and mTORC1 substrates, but this activity was also
insensitive to PI3K or allosteric AKT inhibitors (Figure
6A and Supplemental Figure 7). Importantly, the induction
of AKT S473D also completely blocked the ability of
MK2206 and BEZ235 to increase the mitochondrial
abundance of BIM and BAD in OCI-LY1 cells (Figure
6B). Lastly, AKT S473D expression completely abrogated
the synergy between AKT inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors
in DLBCL cells, and partially reversed the sensitization

by dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (Figure 6C). In particular,
AKT S473D expression completely protected from
sensitization by BEZ235 in OCI-LY1 cells, and partially
protected from GDC-0980 in OCI-LY8 and SU-DHL4
cells. Together, these data support the importance of
AKT in modulating sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonists by
regulating the mitochondrial abundance of BAD and BIM.
The capacity for AKT to modulate BIM expression
has been attributed to direct regulation of FOXO
transcription factors [16]. Thus, to confirm that AKT
inhibition can activate FOXOs in DLBCL, we used a
luciferase reporter assay to measure the transcriptional
activity of FOXOs following PI3K pathway inhibition
[16]. Treatment with either MK2206 or BEZ235 yielded
significantly increased FOXO activity in control cells, but

DISCUSSION

neither inhibitor significantly affected FOXO activity in
OCI-LY1 cells expressing AKT S473D (Supplemental
Figure 8) where phospho-FOXO levels are maintained
(Figure 6A). These results support a model where
activation of FOXOs downstream of AKT inhibition
contributes to BEZ235-mediated apoptotic sensitization.
To investigate whether suppressing AKT-mediated
phosphorylation of BAD contributes to apoptotic
sensitization, we inducibly expressed either wild-type or
an AKT-independent, phospho-null (S136A) mutant of
murine Bad (Figure 7A) [50]. While expression of either
form of Bad was sufficient to induce apoptosis (Figure
7B, 7C), the phospho-null mutant induced significantly
more death than wild-type Bad, despite being expressed
at comparable levels (Figure 7). These data highlight
the importance of AKT activity in limiting the cytotoxic
potential of wild-type Bad. Despite these differences,
when cells were treated with BEZ235 and MK2206, both
forms of Bad induced equivalent amounts of cell death
(Figures 7B, 7C). Together these data support a model
where the amount of de-phosphorylated (active) Bad
determines the degree of apoptosis. Overall, these data
indicate inhibition of AKT, and subsequent accumulation
of BAD and BIM, is a key component of the synergy
between BEZ235 and ABT-199.

Despite showing promising clinical efficacy in
some blood cancers [1], PI3K/mTOR inhibitors lack
single-agent cytotoxicity in aggressive diseases like
DLBCL [45]. In these contexts, combination therapies
may be the key to achieving cancer cell death. While
promising combinations have been identified to treat the
ABC subtype [3], these treatments are largely ineffective
in GCB-DLBCL [4]. Contrary to ABCs where sustained
BTK signaling maintains survival following PI3K
pathway inhibition, in the GCB subtype, BCL-2 overexpression is the likely culprit [6]. However, the potential
of simultaneous inhibition of both PI3K/mTOR and
BCL-2 in this context has not been well-defined. In this
study, we use BH3 profiling to confirm that BCL-2 is the
critical factor that maintains GCB-DLBCL survival in the
absence of PI3K pathway activity. Accordingly, combined
inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 synergistically
induced cell death, even in cells over-expressing BCL2 or MCL-1, both of which are predictors of poor
therapeutic response [5, 37, 40]. Importantly, we also
show that this combination lacks toxicity in normal
human T lymphocytes, which are key mediators of antitumor responses and are important for mediating durable

responses [35, 36]. However, unlike other tumor cell
contexts, where suppression of mTORC1 has been shown
to reduce MCL-1 expression [10-12], our analysis of
GCB-DLBCL cells reveals an unpredicted mechanism
of synergy wherein suppression of AKT induces
mitochondrial accumulation of BAD and BIM (Figure
8). Together, these data provide an alternative rationale
for combining PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 inhibitors as a
promising therapy for GCB-DLBCL.
It is surprising that unlike in other contexts [10-12],
suppression of mTORC1-dependent translation neither
reduces MCL-1 expression, nor alters sensitivity to the
NOXA peptide in GCB-DLBCL cell lines. A simple
explanation for this discrepancy is that MCL-1 regulation
may be cell-type-specific. Indeed, PI3K/mTOR inhibition
significantly reduced MCL-1 expression in cells derived
from a different B cell malignancy (BV173 B-ALL cells).
However, work from others demonstrating the sensitivity
of MCL-1 expression to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in ABT199/737-resistant GCB-DLBCL cells [13, 14], requires
an alternative explanation. In this situation, it is plausible
that the selection of ABT-199-resistant cells enriches

for those cells that up-regulate MCL-1 in an mTORC1dependent manner [40, 51, 52]. Indeed, when compared
to the parental SU-DHL6 line, PI3K/mTOR inhibition
selectively down-regulates MCL-1 only in ABT-199resistant cells, highlighting the heterogeneity of survival
dependencies even within variants of one cell line. It is
important to note that dysregulated MCL-1 expression
can be conferred by defects in any of the multiple layers
of regulation (transcriptional [42, 53], translational [52],
and post-translational levels [54-56]). Nevertheless,
our data that knockdown or over-expression of MCL-1
can modulate sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonists strongly
supports the work of others that describe the potential of
targeting MCL-1 in rational combinations involving BH3
mimetics.
Contrary to previous reports, in this study we
describe an alternative mechanism of synergy between
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and BCL-2 antagonists in GCBDLBCL, which involves the mitochondrial accumulation
of BAD and BIM. We identify that this effect stems
from suppression of AKT, as inducible expression of
constitutively active AKT prevented accumulation of

Figure 8: Model of synergy between BEZ235 and ABT-263 in DLBCL cell lines. Treatment with BEZ235 in DLBCL cell lines

completely inhibits signaling through the PI3K and downstream effectors, AKT and mTORC1. Suppression of mTORC1 may reduce capdependent translation of pro-survival proteins (other than MCL-1) downstream of 4E-BPs. Loss of AKT activity promotes FOXO-mediated
transcription of BIM and facilitates mitochondrial accumulation of dephosphorylated BAD. When combined with ABT-263 or ABT-199,
the combination promotes MOMP through BIM-activated BAX and BAK oligomerization, leading to induction of apoptosis.

BAD and BIM and abolished the synergy. While these
particular survival outputs from AKT have been described
previously [16, 17], the potential of their suppression in
modulating sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonists has not been
previously demonstrated in DLBCL. Nevertheless, it is
unsurprising that accumulation of both BIM and BAD at
the mitochondria can sensitize to BCL-2 antagonists. The
requirement for BIM in the initiation of apoptosis has been
well-characterized [57] and BIM up-regulation is required
for synergy of BEZ235 and ABT-737 in ovarian cancer
cells [12]. Similarly, the consequences of over-activating
BAD are straightforward; since BCL-2 antagonists
themselves were designed to mimic the function of BAD.
By activating BAD, PI3K pathway inhibitors increase the
concentration of endogenous BCL-2 antagonists (BAD
and BIM protein), which can predictably enhance the
effects of pharmacological BCL-2 antagonists (ABT199/263) [11]. Despite the observed synergism between
PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 inhibitors in these GCBDLBCL lines, it is important to note that the magnitude
of BAD and BIM accumulation induced by PI3K pathway
suppression is insufficient to induce apoptosis. As such,
it is also unlikely that suppression of AKT would confer
sensitivity to BH3 mimetics in cells that are fundamentally
insensitive to BCL-2 antagonism (e.g. BAX/BAK null
or MCL-1 over-expressing cells). Regardless, these data
identify an alternative mechanism of synergy between
PI3K/mTOR and BCL-2 inhibitors in which suppression
of AKT enhances the activity/expression of pro-apoptotic
factors.
In conclusion, while the mechanism may differ
depending on the context, the combination of PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibitors and BCL-2 antagonists strongly
synergizes to kill DLBCL cells. In fact, the existence of
multiple mechanisms of synergy may prove beneficial in
combating tumor heterogeneity and preventing acquired
resistance in a clinical setting. In addition, our results
define alternative markers of response and identify
situations in which tracking MCL-1 expression may not
be predictive of patient responses. Thus, the results of
this, and other, studies provide a strengthened rationale for
testing dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with BCL-2 inhibitors
in GCB-DLBCL patients.

Cell culture
OCI-LY1, OCI-LY7, OCI-LY8, and SUDHL4 cell lines (a gift from Dr. Laura Pasqualucci,
Columbia University) were cultured in IMDM (GE
Healthcare Hyclone, Little Chalfont, UK) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 mM
L-Glutamine, 100 I.U. penicillin, and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified 37°C
incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely tested to
ensure absence of mycoplasma, and were maintained at or
below 2 x 106 cells/mL. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)
293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 I.U. penicillin,
and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood
samples by centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque™ (GE

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mM
Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF) supplemented
with protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, USA) and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Protein concentrations were normalized using a Bradford
protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were prepared at 1 µg/µl
concentration in 1X XT Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad) and 5%

cells in viral supernatants for 72 hours (changing
supernatant every 24 hours) with 10 µg/ml 1,5-dimethyl1,5-diazaundecamethylene polymethobromide (polybrene,
Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were treated with either blasticidin
(8 µg/ml) or puromycin (2 µg/ml) for 5 days after
transduction to select for stably transduced cells. Plasmidpositive cells were maintained with blasticidin (4 µg/ml)
or puromycin (1 µg/ml).

Cell viability

Expression plasmids

Cell viability assays were performed in 96-well
plates, with 6 x 104 cells in 200 µl. Cells were harvested
by centrifuging the 96-well plate in a plate spinner
centrifuge at 500 g for 5 minutes. Cells were incubated
in 1 µg/ml 7-aminoactinomycin D (Life Technologies) in
Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Life Technologies)
supplemented with 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 10
min at room temperature. Cell fluorescence was assessed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson,
San Jose, CA, USA). Analysis of the data was completed
using FlowJo Software v10.0.7 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).

To generate DLBCL cells with doxycyclineinducible expression of a gene of interest, cells were first
transduced with pMA2640 (Addgene plasmid #25434)
and selected for blasticidin resistance. Expression of
the improved tetracycline-controlled transactivator
(rtTA-Advanced) allowed for doxycycline-inducible
expression of genes downstream of the modified Tetresponsive element provided in the pLVX-tight-puro
vector (Clontech). To generate MCL-1 expression
plasmid, the human MCL-1 cDNA was cloned from
pCMV-Flag-hMCL-1 (Addgene plasmid #25392) into
pUC118 using BamHI and EcoRV. MCL-1 was then
cloned into plvx-tight-puro using BamHI and NotI. To
generate the AKT(S473D)-pLVX-tight-puro plasmid, we
cloned AKT (S473D) from a plasmid received from Dr.
Bing Su (Yale University) into pLVX-tight-puro using
NotI and EcoRI. To generate BAD expression plasmids,
murine Bad (S136A) in pcDNA3 (Addgene plasmid
#8798) was cloned into plvx-tight-puro using EcoRI. WT
murine Bad was generated using the QuikChange II XL
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) to introduce a point mutation
to restore expression of a serine rather than alanine at
position 136. The following primers were used for this
purpose 5’-AGGACGCTCGCGTTCGGCTCCCC-3’ and
5’-GGGAGCCGAACGCGAGCGTCCT-3’. To generate
BCL-2 expression plasmid, the human BCL-2 cDNA was
cloned from pMIG-BCL-2 (Addgene plasmid #8793) into
pLVX-tight-puro using EcoRI. pLKO.1 shRNA expression
plasmids containing MCL-1 hairpins (TRCN0000005514,
TRCN0000005516, TRCN0000005517) were a gift from
Dr. Anand Ganesan (UC Irvine). All pLVX-tight-puro
plasmids were sequenced using the following primer,
5’-AGCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGATC-3’.

BH3 profile
OCI-LY1 and SU-DHL4 cell lines were profiled as
previously described,[18] with modifications. Cells were
plated at 8 x 106 cells per 10 ml of media and treated with
inhibitors for 16 hours. 4 x 105 cells were incubated in
T-EB buffer (300 mM trehalose, 10 mM HEPES, 80 mM
potassium chloride, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1%
BSA, and 5 mM succinic acid) with 200 nM JC-1 (Life
Technologies), 0.001% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10
µg/ml oligomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) with either DMSO or
BH3-only peptides for 60 minutes prior to analysis using
a FACScalibur (Becton-Dickinson). The sequences and
method of synthesis of BH3-only peptides were described
previously [59]. Percent depolarization caused by each
BH3-only peptide was calculated as the percent difference
in the JC-1 red fluorescence (590 nm) relative to DMSOtreated control cells.

Retro/lentiviral transductions
For all viral productions, 293T HEK cells were
transfected using X-tremeGene HP DNA Transfection
Reagent (Roche, Switzerland). 293T cells were incubated
for 24 hours prior to replacing medium with IMDM.
These virus-containing media were then harvested after
an additional 24 hours and used to transduce DLBCL
cell lines. For retroviral production, 293T cells were
co-transfected with pCL-ampho viral packaging vector
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) whereas pCMVVSVG (Addgene plasmid 8454) and psPAX2 (Addgene
plasmid 12260) were co-transfected for lentivirus
production. To transduce DLBCL cell lines, we incubated

Subcellular fractionation
Subcellular fractionation was performed as
described previously [60]. In brief, cells were harvested
and resuspended in isotonic buffer (250 mM sucrose, 20
mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, USA), and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich)).

Co-immunoprecipitation

REFERENCES

Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as
described previously [60]. Briefly, total cell lysates were
prepared using 1% CHAPS buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 137
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% CHAPS, 20
mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Calbiochem, USA)). BCL-2 was immunoprecipitated
from 500 µg protein using anti-BCL-2 (BD Pharmingen)
and a slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare)
at 4˚C for 16 hours. Immunoprecipitates were washed
three times in 1% CHAPS buffer and eluted from beads by
boiling in 1X XT Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad) in 1% CHAPS
buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10
minutes.
