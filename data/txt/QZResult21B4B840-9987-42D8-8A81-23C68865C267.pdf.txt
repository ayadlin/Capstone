Abstract
Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) is being developed as a novel virotherapeutic against human brain cancer and has promising activity against human brain tumor models in immunocompromised hosts. Because
an intact immune system could reduce its efficacy, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the oncolytic
potential of MYXV in immunocompetent racine glioma models. Here, we report that MYXV infects and kills
all racine cell glioma lines and that its effects are enhanced by rapamycin. Intratumoral administration of
MYXV with rapamycin improved viral replication in the tumor and significantly prolonged host survival.
Similarly, coadministration via a method of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) enhanced viral replication
and efficacy in vivo. Mechanisms by which rapamycin improved MYXV oncolysis included an inhibition of
type I IFN production in vitro and a reduction of intratumoral infiltration of CD68+ microglia/macrophages
and CD163+ macrophages in vivo. Our findings define a method to improve MYXV efficacy against gliomas
by rapamycin coadministration, which acts to promote immune responses engaged by viral delivery. Cancer

Introduction
The current management of patients with malignant gliomas uses a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (1) but is unsatisfactory because patients survive
for only a year on average. Thus, new treatment approaches
are desperately needed. Recently, oncolytic viruses have been
evaluated against malignant gliomas in preclinical models
(2–7) and in clinical trials (8–12).
We discovered that myxoma virus (MYXV) was oncolytic
for several human cancers (5, 13–16). It is promising for human therapy because its genome has been sequenced, it is
simple to engineer, its natural tropism is highly restricted
to European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and there is no
acquired viral immunity in humans (17). Despite its extremely narrow host tropism in nature, MYXV infects many human

cancer cells and certain nonrabbit cells in vitro (18), which
have defects in their IFN responses (19, 20). Cancer cells,
such as gliomas, which have activated Akt, are particularly
susceptible to MYXV (21, 22).
The preclinical models traditionally used to evaluate oncolytic viruses in malignant gliomas have been in immunodeficient mice bearing human tumors (2–6). Few have used
immunocompetent models (23–26). We have reported promising efficacy of MYXV in immunocompromised brain tumor
models (5, 14, 15); there is one report of MYXV in an immunocompetent model of melanoma (16). The evaluation of an
oncolytic virus in immunocompetent setting is important because both the innate and the acquired immune system may
dramatically modulate oncolytic efficacy. This host modulation could either reduce [e.g., impairing viral infection or intratumoral (i.t.) distribution] or enhance (e.g., stimulate
antitumor immune responses) oncolysis. Thus, a systematic
evaluation of MYXV in immunocompetent glioma models is
needed to address these issues. We chose a racine, rather
than a spontaneously occurring murine genetic model, because this syngeneic line establishes reproducible and consistent tumor burden in its immunocompetent host and has a
long track record (25). The more readily available transgenic
murine models use (retro-) viral vectors in their derivation,
which could confound the evaluation of immune responses
in these gliomas. Hence, we chose an immunocompetent racine model of glioma in this study.
The best examples of modulating immune responses to
improve oncolytic virus efficacy have been with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is neutralized by complement when
administered i.v. or by microglia (CD68 cells) and macrophages (CD163 cells) when administered i.t. Inhibiting both

Optimizing Myxoma Virotherapy for Malignant Glioma

pathways using cyclophosphamide increases viral replication
and oncolysis (27–29). In our study, we chose rapamycin as a
cotherapeutic with MYXV for several reasons. First, rapamycin enhances MYXV tumor cell infection in vitro [possibly by
further activating Akt (30) or inhibiting a type I IFN response
(31)] and in animal tumor models (14, 16). Second, rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits the development and/or activation of numerous arms of the innate or
adaptive immune response, most well studied being the
blocking of T-cell activation/proliferation during allograft rejection (32). Third, it has direct activity against several cancers/gliomas (33, 34) and is safer than cyclophosphamide
(34). We therefore considered it an ideal candidate for combination therapy with MYXV in malignant gliomas.
We also evaluated a second strategy, convection-enhanced
delivery (CED), to enhance the therapeutic potential of
MYXV. CED can help optimize delivery and biodistribution
(35, 36). Here, we assessed CED of MYXV, either singly or
in combination with rapamycin, to further augment the efficacy of MYXV in an immunocompetent model.
The objectives of this study were to determine in immunocompetent models of gliomas (a) the safety/toxicity of the
intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of MYXV, (b) the efficacy of
MYXV alone or in combination with rapamycin against malignant gliomas, and (c) the efficacy of CED of MYXV combined with rapamycin in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, viruses, and reagents. Established rat glioma
cell lines RG2, 9L, F98, and C6 and murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were grown in DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal
bovine serum. The firefly luciferase gene plasmid (pGL3 enhancer vector; Promega) was cotransfected into RG2 cells as
reported before (37). All the viruses used in this study were
constructed in the laboratory of G. McFadden, and virus was
propagated and titrated by focus formation on BGMK cells as
described previously (5, 16, 21, 22, 38, 39). UV-inactivated
MYXV [dead virus (DV)] was prepared by irradiating virus
with UV light for 2 h. Rapamycin was obtained from LC Laboratories, and RAD001 dry powder and cyclophosphamide
were obtained from Sigma.
Virus infection assays. Cells were exposed to MYXV or DV
incubated at 37°C for 1 h, fresh medium was added, and cells
were cultured until further analysis. For the combined therapy, rapamycin was added to the cells 1 h before virus infection. For 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside
(X-Gal) staining experiments, MYXV-lac–infected cells were
stained with X-Gal to detect β-galactosidase activity (14).
For cell viability experiments, cell viability was measured at
48 or 72 h after infection by MTT assay, as described previously (5, 14, 25).
Western blot analysis. Western blot was performed using
polyclonal MYXV antibodies (M-T7 and Serp-1, recognizing
early and late MYXV gene products, respectively), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody was
used to detect MYXV proteins, as described previously (5, 14).

Safety/toxicity of i.c. administration of MYXV in nontumorbearing rats. Fischer 344 rats under anesthesia (ketamine
and xylazine) received i.c. injection of the different doses of
MYXV [in 5 μL; 5 × 106, 1 × 107, 5 × 107, and 1 × 108 plaqueforming units (pfu)/rat (10 μL, the highest feasible dose we
can prepare)] or saline (5 μL), as we described previously (25).
Animals were followed for up to 30 d. Animals losing ≥20%
body weight or having other unacceptable symptoms were
sacrificed as Animal Care Guidelines. After sacrificed, brains
and major organs were processed for histologic examination.
In vivo studies in rodent orthotopic glioma model in immunocompetent hosts. RG2 cells (1 × 104 per rat) were implanted into Fischer 344 rats under anesthesia as described
before (25). For experiments assessing survival, i.t. administration of 1 × 107 pfu (in 5 μL PBS) of either DV or MYXV
at 5 d after implantation, animals were followed until they
developed symptoms. To test the effect of combination
therapy using MYXV and rapamycin or cyclophosphamide,
RG2 tumor-bearing animals were divided into the following
groups (five to six animals per group): (a) DV control, (b)
cyclophosphamide or rapamycin alone (5 mg/kg rapamycin,
i.p., five times per week for a total of 2 wk; or 60 mg/kg
cyclophosphamide, one time only), (c) MYXV (1 × 10 7
pfu/rat, every other day for a total of three injections),
and (d) MYXV plus rapamycin/or cyclophosphamide. Animals were monitored daily and sacrificed when symptoms
developed. We repeat the above experiment with F98 rat
brain tumor model.
For experiments assessing the effects of rapamycin and
cyclophosphamide on the immune response to viral replication, RG2-bearing animals were treated, as described
above for the survival study, 8 d after implantation. Animals were sacrificed at 24 and 72 h and 7 d after treatment (three animals per treatment). When sacrificed, the
brains were imaged and then embedded with OCT for immunohistochemistry, or the green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–expressing tumor was saved in liquid nitrogen to
quantify the virus titers as described previously (5, 14).
CED of MYXV plus rapamycin in RG2 glioma model of
immunocompetent hosts. To determine if the delivery of
MYXV via CED in combination with rapamycin would further increase the therapeutic benefit, we used the same infusion system and infusion rates as the Sugiyama group (36).
RG2-bearing rats were divided into the following groups (five
or six animals per group) 5 d after implantation: (a) DV
(CED) control, (b) MYXV i.t. only (1 × 107 pfu, in 5 μL PBS),
(c) MYXV CED only (1 × 107 pfu, in 20 μL PBS), (d) MYXV i.t.
plus rapamycin (MYXV: 1 × 107 pfu; 5 mg/kg rapamycin, i.p.,
five times per week for a total of 2 wk), and (e) MYXV CED plus
rapamycin. Animals were monitored daily for survival studies.
To check the virus distribution, animals were sacrificed at
72 h and 7 and 12 d after virus treatment (three animals per
treatment). After sacrifice, the same procedure with above
was used to get the brain image and tumor tissue viral titers.
Immunohistochemistry. Frozen sections were exposed to
primary antibody [a rabbit polyclonal myxoma antibody MT7 (1:2,000) or mouse anti-rat CD68 (1:500; Serotec) and
CD163 (1:300; Serotec)] in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at

room temperature after fixation and blocking. Biotinylated
anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) were
used as a secondary antibody. Sections were then incubated
with avidin conjugated to HRP, and staining was visualized by
the addition of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging. On days 7, 10, 13, 17,
20, 27, 33, and 41 after RG2-Fluc (1 × 104 cells per rat) implantation, rats from different treatment groups—DV, rapamycin,
MYXV, and MYXV + rapamycin (four or five rats per group)—
were imaged with the Xenogen IVIS 200 system to record
bioluminescent signal emitted from tumors. Data were analyzed based on total photon flux emission (photons/s) in the
region of interest over the intracranial space as reported previously (40).
Statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute, Inc.) and GraphPad Prism (version 4; GraphPad Software, Inc.) were used for statistical analyses. Survival curves
were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. All reported P
values were two-sided and were considered to be statistically
significant at P < 0.05.

Results
MYXV infects and kills racine glioma cell lines in vitro.
All four glioma cell lines (RG2, F98, C6, and 9L) were found to
be permissive to MYXV [5 multiplicities of infection (MOI),
48 hours] as illustrated by the expression of GFP (early gene)
and β-galactosidase (late gene). In contrast, control line
NIH3T3 was poorly permissive to MYXV (Fig. 1A). Next, to
assess whether the appearance of viral proteins correlated
with cellular susceptibility in the glioma cells, MTT assays
were performed. All four glioma cell lines were killed by
MYXV (10 MOI, 48 hours; Fig. 1B). In contrast, >70% of the
NIH3T3 cells were viable after exposure to MYXV.
Pretreatment with rapamycin enhances viral replication and promotes MYXV oncolysis in racine glioma cells
in vitro. Treatment of RG2 and F98 cells with MYXV plus
rapamycin resulted in significantly greater cell killing in vitro
than either treatment alone [5% versus 80% for RG2; 8% versus 75% for F98; 1 nmol/L rapamycin; **, P < 0.001, t test;
Fig. 2A; doses of 0.1 nmol/L rapamycin showed no effect
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and B)]; similar results were seen
with a second mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001 (Supplementary Fig. S1C). There was no significant effect on NIH3T3 cells (3% versus 5%; Fig. 2A). To
determine if the increase in cell susceptibility was the result
of increased viral replication, we next assessed virus gene expression. F98 and RG2 treated with MYXV (1 MOI) following
pretreatment with rapamycin (20 nmol/L) showed substantially more viral GFP and β-galactosidase (Fig. 2B, inset) expression than cells treated with virus alone 48 hours after
infection (Fig. 2B). The increase was specific for the glioma
cells, as no increase was detected in the NIH3T3 cells
(Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, treatment of the racine glioma
lines with both MYXV (0.1 MOI) and rapamycin (20 nmol/L)
resulted in a significant increase in viral titers 72 hours after
infection as compared with virus alone (**, P < 0.05, t test;
Fig. 2C).

slight weight loss seen at the highest dose (1 × 108 pfu), which
slowly recovered within 2 weeks (Fig. 3A). There were no
deaths (Fig. 3B), no observed pathologic changes at 30 days
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), and no neurologic symptoms noted

(3 days) after i.c. administration (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
For subsequent in vivo experiments, we therefore selected a
MYXV dose of 1 × 107 pfu.

expression (approximately 3–5% of the tumor cells; Fig. 4A,

plus rapamycin showed substantially more viral GFP expression (Fig. 4A, top right) and viral protein detected by immunohistochemistry (approximately 35–40% of tumor cells; Fig. 4A,
bottom) 24 hours after infection. In addition, significantly
higher viral titers were detected when using rapamycin, which
persisted for at least 7 days (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similar
results were observed using the F98 glioma model, where

MYXV–red fluorescent protein virus (5 × 106 pfu) was used in
combination with rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Significantly, no virus replication was observed in any normal
brain tissues, either with or without rapamycin.
Combination therapy of MYXV with rapamycin prolongs
survival in two immunocompetent racine glioma models.
RG2 and F98 cells were implanted into rats to establish immunocompetent glioma models as described previously (25).
Four days later, rapamycin was injected i.p., and the following day, DV or MYXV was injected i.t. Treatment with MYXV
alone did not prolong survival of animals harboring RG2 tumors (P = 0.078, log-rank test; Fig. 4B) and only slightly prolonged the survival in animals with F98 tumors (P = 0.0439;
Fig. 4D). In contrast, treatment with MYXV plus rapamycin
significantly prolonged survival as compared with treatment
with MYXV alone (P = 0.0398, Fig. 4B; P = 0.0411, Fig. 4D) or
as compared with treatment with the DV (P = 0.0011, Fig. 4B;
P = 0.0025, Fig. 4D) in both animal models. Rapamycin alone
did prolong survival of animals bearing RG2 gliomas (P =
0.026; Fig. 4B) but had no effect on survival in animals bearing F98 gliomas (P = 0.1167; Fig. 4D). We confirmed these
results using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). RG2-Fluc–bearing
animals were imaged at varying time points in the presence or
absence of MYXV and/or rapamycin using the Xenogen 200
system. Control (PBS) and MYXV-treated animals had a BLI
that rapidly increased starting on day 7 after tumor implantation (6.34E+05, 5.73E+04), reaching a peak by day 13 (1.98E
+07, 1.81E+07; Fig. 4C); BLI signal of rapamycin-treated rats
was not detected until day 13 (4.95E+04), slowly increasing
between days 13 and 27 to reach a peak level by day 33
(2.04E+07); in contrast, a very low BLI signal from rats treated
with MYXV + rapamycin first appeared on day 17 (7.71E+04),
and very slowly increasing until day 27, but still did not reach
peak levels by day 41 (1.04E+07, termination of the experiment) after tumor implantation (Fig. 4C; Supplementary
Fig. S3C). These results were consistent with the histologic examination at day 13 (Fig. 4C, bottom).
CED of MYXV further improves efficacy in vivo. RG2bearing animals were treated with rapamycin 4 days after
tumor implantation. The following day, DV or MYXV was administered via CED as described above. We found that compared with DV-treated animals, MYXV delivered via CED
significantly improved survival (P = 0.0045, log-rank test;
Fig. 5A) and this was further increased when MYXV was delivered by CED in combination with rapamycin (P < 0.0007;
Fig. 5A), with 50% of the animals subsisting as “long-term”
survivors (>45 days). In addition, combined CED MYXV
and rapamycin significantly prolonged survival as compared
with CED MYXV alone (P = 0.0009; Fig. 5A) or i.t. administered MYXV in combination with rapamycin (P = 0.0398;
Fig. 5A). To determine if the prolonged survival was the result of increased viral replication, we measured in vivo virus
distribution and viral titers. Animals treated with MYXV delivered via CED together with rapamycin had significantly
higher levels of viral GFP expression (Fig. 5B), with virus persisting longer than either CED MYXV alone or MYXV administered i.t. in the presence of rapamycin (**, P < 0.001, t test;
Fig. 5B and C). Importantly, we found that CED MYXV alone

602

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

increased virus replication and spread, with the presence of
virus being detected up to 12 days after virus administration
(Fig. 5B and C).
Rapamycin blocks IFN inhibition of MYXV infection and
inhibits macrophage/microglial infiltration in glioblastoma multiforme. To begin to understand the mechanism(s)
by which rapamycin enhances MYXV replication and oncolysis, we first confirmed that rapamycin inhibited the mTOR
pathway and activated Akt as previously described (14, 30).
Rapamycin alone, MYXV alone, or both increased the phosphorylation of both Ser473 and Thr308 in both RG2 and F98
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). In both cell lines, the levels
of phosphorylated p70S6K were unchanged by infection with
MYXV alone but were significantly inhibited by rapamycin,
effectively inhibiting mTOR under the conditions used with
as little as 1 nmol/L rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S4). We
next investigated the effect of IFN on the replication of
MYXV in glioma cells in vitro. The decision to test IFN was
based on the observation that the IFN response of the host
cell triggered by MYXV accounts for resistance to poxvirus
infection (18). In addition, many glioma cells are not believed
to express IFNα or IFNβ (19, 41–44), but they respond to exogenous IFN (19, 45). RG2 and F98 were pretreated with racine-IFNα or racine-IFNβ for 6 hours before infection with

MYXV in the presence or absence of rapamycin. We found
that the presence of either IFNα (50 units/mL) or IFNβ
(100 units/mL) was able to limit MYXV (0.1 MOI) infection
as assessed by GFP expression 48 hours (or 72 hours) after
infection (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S5C), a limitation that
was reversed by the presence of rapamycin (20 nmol/L;

Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S5C). As little as 1.0 nmol/L
(but not 0.1 nmol/L) of rapamycin blocked the antiviral response found with IFN (Supplementary Fig. S6A–C). To confirm that the expression of GFP correlated with viral
replication, following treatment, RG2 and F98 cells were
lysed and Western blots were performed for M-T7. We found

that cells treated with racine-IFNα or racine-IFNβ showed
very little M-T7 viral protein expression, whereas pretreatment of cells with rapamycin 1 hour before virus treatment
restored M-T7 viral protein expression (Supplementary
Fig. S5A and B). Consistent with these results, as determined
by foci formation assays on BGMK cells 72 hours following
treatment, both IFNα and IFNβ significantly inhibited viral
replication, and the presence of rapamycin negated this inhibitory effect (Fig. 6B). These functional data suggest that
rapamycin may help MYXV replication and spread, at least
in part, by inhibiting the ability of glioma cells to respond

to type I IFN. Next, we wanted to determine if treatment
with rapamycin blocked type I IFN responses to MYXV infection biochemically in the glioma cell line (Fig. 6C, lane 3).
Exogenous IFNα induced IFN-related factor-7 (IRF-7) and
ISG15, showing biochemically that these cells maintain their
ability to respond to exogenous IFN, an effect that seemed
to be unaffected by rapamycin. Further, MYXV induced
IFNβ, IRF-7, and ISG15 in these cells, suggesting that these
rat glioma cell lines can detect and mount a cellular innate
viral response to the virus (Fig. 6C, lane 6), a response that
was totally or partially blocked with rapamycin (Fig. 6C,

lane 7). Finally, rapamycin partially inhibited the response
of these genes to exogenous IFNα with MYXV, most notably
with level of IFNβ and IRF-7 (Fig. 6C, lane 8). Together, these
data suggest that rapamycin may help MYXV replication and
spread, at least in part, by inhibiting the initial type I IFN response of glioma cells. However, as shown in Fig. 6A and B
and Fig. 6C (lane 8), rapamycin can mitigate the protection
from exogenous type I IFN in the presence of MYXV, suggesting that rapamycin may be playing a role in dulling the response of the tumor to type I IFN. This is a novel finding and
one that is currently being investigated by our laboratory.
To further assess whether the increase in MYXV replication observed in vivo was also the result of a decreased host
cellular immune response to the virus infection. We performed immunohistochemical staining for markers of microglia/macrophages (CD68/CD163). We found that the
presence of MYXV in the tumor induced an increase in infiltrating CD68+ microglia/macrophages and CD163+ peripheral macrophages that was abolished when the animals were
given rapamycin or cyclophosphamide (Fig. 6D; Supplementary Fig. S7D). This suggests that part of the enhanced viral
replication observed in vivo is the result of the immunosuppressant functions of these drugs on the host innate cellular
immune response to the virus infection.

Discussion
We show here for the first time that oncolytic MYXV has
significant therapeutic activity and minimal toxicity in rat
immunocompetent models of malignant glioma. We made
several novel observations. First, there were no significant
toxicities when MYXV was administered directly into the
brains of immunocompetent rats. Second, unlike xenografted
gliomas in immunodeficient mice, MYXV had no significant
activity as monotherapy in vivo. However, survival was markedly prolonged when it was administered with rapamycin.
The enhanced oncolytic effect of rapamycin is due to the reduction of type I IFN responses and the reduced infiltration
of inflammatory [natural killer (NK; CD68+) and microglia/
macrophage (CD163+)] cells into gliomas treated with MYXV.
Finally, the efficacy of combination therapy with MYXV and
rapamycin is improved by delivering the virus through CED.
This report supports the concept that a major barrier to effective oncolytic virus therapy for glioma patients will be innate antiviral immune responses. In immunocompromised
mice, MYXV administered i.t. cured most animals (5) but
was ineffective as a monotherapy in immunocompetent rats.
Although it is possible that this reflects species differences in

the tumor (i.e., human versus racine gliomas) or the host (i.e.,
CD-1 nude mice versus Fischer 344 rats), it is more likely that
this is due to an intact antiviral response in the immunocompetent hosts. This is the first report to show that immunosuppression with rapamycin enhances oncolysis in gliomas in
immunocompetent hosts in vivo. The mechanisms by which
rapamycin affects innate immune responses within the gliomas and the surrounding normal host tissues are not completely understood; however, we do know that type I IFN is
an important component of the innate response to MYXV.
MYXV replication in mammalian cells is naturally sensitive
to inhibition by IFN (38), and the host antiviral responses mediated by type I IFN are a major determinant of its restrictive
host range outside the natural rabbit host (18). Moreover,
RIG-I mediates the coinduction of tumor necrosis factor and
type I IFN elicited by MYXV in primary human macrophages,
and together, these two induced cytokines shut down virus
replication in all primary untransformed human cells tested
to date (41). In normal noncancerous cells, one model of
mTOR signaling and viral infection proposes that rapamycin
suppresses innate immune responses by limiting the translation of IRF-7 (31, 46), transcription factor needed for a robust
IFN response. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (47), which constitutively express IRF-7, phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6K2
mediates downstream signaling cascades following the recognition of viral nucleic acids by Toll-like receptors 7 and 9. S6K1
and S6K2, which are downstream of mTOR, facilitate the formation of the Toll-like receptor 9/MyD88 complex, which in
turn activates IRF-7 and the transcription of type I IFN. Therefore, blocking mTOR with rapamycin leads to reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6K2, the inactivation of IRF-7, and a
reduced type I IFN response. Finally, rapamycin may also increase the levels of activated Akt in cancer cells (14, 16, 30).
Although it is unknown if these mechanisms enhance MYXV
viral infection in gliomas, we report here for the first time that
rapamycin effectively blocks type I IFN responses, which enhance MYXV replication and cell killing in vitro.
In vivo, the ability of rapamycin to increase MYXV replication and spread within glioma tissue is multifactorial and reflects the contributions from both tumor cells and the
accompanying normal innate immune cells in the brain (especially the resident microglia, macrophages). Because rapamycin is an immunosuppressant in its own right, it can
prevent T-cell proliferation/activation (48) and reduces the
total population of CD4+ T cells (32), as well as the less studied effects of blocking B-cell and NK cell proliferation, among
other immunomodulatory effects (49). In addition, the ability
of rapamycin to restore the oncolytic effect to MYXV in the
face of exogenous IFN may be particularly important because

Optimizing Myxoma Virotherapy for Malignant Glioma

IFNs are likely released from the surrounding tumor stroma
and immune cells of the brain in response to the local infection. Gliomas retain their ability to respond to exogenous IFN
(19, 45) but many have lost the capacity to produce type I
IFNs (42–45). So, presumably, IFNs released locally from the
surrounding normal tissue in response to MYXV infection
could block i.t. viral replication and spread of MYXV. It is likely that these, and several other mechanisms, are relevant
in vivo. A limitation of our study is that we may not have
optimized the use of rapamycin in this setting. Rather, we
used rapamycin on a standard “chemotherapy” regimen of a
single course (for 2 weeks). Using it as a “switch” to control
oncolytic viral replication in glioma patients might require repeated administration “tailored” to the response of the tumor.
Our data do not allow us to definitively determine if rapamycin is superior to cyclophosphamide in improving the oncolytic effect of MYXV in vivo. Using rapamycin, we found
that the titers of live virus were higher, the survivals were
longer, and the reduction of recruitment of CD68 + and
CD163+ cells seemed more than when using the combination
therapy with cyclophosphamide (Supplementary Fig.). Our
study was not designed to test which of these drugs was superior because of several limitations. The dose of cyclophosphamide we used (60 mg/kg) was lower than other studies
[(>100 mg/kg for rats (50) or even 300 mg/kg for mice (29)]
because these higher doses were not tolerated in the animals
used in this study. Hence, the degree of immunosuppression
with cyclophosphamide in our hands may have been less
than in other studies. We were also unable to definitively
compare the suppression of recruitment of CD68 + and
CD163+ cells because our assessment was based on immunohistochemistry and was qualitative and we did not perform a
functional assessment of NK or microglial/macrophage functions. Lastly, given the limitations in generalizing results
from rodents into humans, we consider combination therapy
with either cyclophosphamide or rapamycin to be reasonable
combination therapies that need a clinical trial to determine
which is clinically superior.

The short-lived (<72 hours) replication of MYXV in vivo
when administered alone will be a major therapeutic barrier.
In an effort to prolong viral replication, we evaluated the alternative delivery technique CED. It provides a wider distribution and higher concentration of many therapeutic agents
(35, 36). We found that CED in gliomas (i.e., treatment began
10 days after tumor inoculation when tumors were large) significantly prolonged MYXV replication in vivo (>12 days). We
propose, therefore, that MYXV be coadministered with rapamycin and delivered via CED when MYXV is tested in a glioma
clinical trial. There are no reports of CED of oncolytic viruses
in gliomas, although one clinical trial with CED of reovirus is
under way.7
In conclusion, we have shown that virotherapy with MYXV
is safe when administered i.c. and, when combined with rapamycin and administered via CED, is efficacious in immunocompetent racine glioma models. This combinatorial
approach awaits evaluation in a clinical trial in brain tumor
patients.
