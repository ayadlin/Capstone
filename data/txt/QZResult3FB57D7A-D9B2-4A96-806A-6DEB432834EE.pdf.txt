ABSTRACT
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a frequently recurrent deadly
cancer for which no efficient targeted drug exists. AXL is an adverse prognostic factor
in some cancers. Strong clinical evidence to support the prognostic role of AXL in
ESCC is lacking. A total of 116 patients diagnosed with operable primary ESCC were
enrolled. Both AXL and HER2 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) in esophageal tissue and were correlated with the clinical outcome of patients.
The efficacy of the AXL targeted drug foretinib was also evaluated in ESCC cells.
Expression of AXL was found in about 80 % of ESCC tissue, and was significantly
correlated with progression of tumor (P<0.001), increased risk of death (Hazard ratio
HR [95 % CI=2.09[1.09-4.04], P=0.028], and distant metastasis (odds ratio OR [95
%CI]=3.96 (1.16-13.60), P=0.029). The adverse clinical impact of AXL was more
evident when cumulatively expressed with HER2. In cell model, ESCC cells were more
sensitive to AXL inhibitor foretinib than to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. Meanwhile,
the AXL inhibitor foretinib showed a synergistic effect with HER2 inhibitors and the
potential to overcome drug resistance to lapatinib. We thus concluded that AXL is a
strong adverse prognostic factor for ESCC. Therapeutic agents targeting AXL have
great potential to improve prognosis of ESCC patients.

HER2/Neu belongs to the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family. It is an important
drug target for cancers, including breast cancer and
gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma [6–7].
HER2 inhibition in combination with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy has been demonstrated to significantly
improve response rate and overall or progression-free
survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction or the stomach who over-express
HER2 [7]. In studies of ESCC, however, the rate of HER2
over-expression has been reported to be less than 10 %
[8–10] and the efficacy of HER2 targeted drugs in ESCC
has not been demonstrated.
AXL (also call Ark or Ufo) is a receptor tyrosine
kinase belonging to the Tyro3/Axl/Mer (TAM) family

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal cancer is a fast-growing and deadly
disease. It presents most often as esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC), which accounts for 95 % of
esophageal cancer worldwide [1–2]. The standard
treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer
is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or
without surgery. Patients with esophageal cancer enjoy
better survival once they have had a good response
to neoadjuvant therapy [3]. Unfortunately, there is no
effective targeted therapeutic strategy available for ESCC
and the prognosis for esophageal cancer is relatively poor
with an average 5-year survival rate of less than 20 %
[1, 4–5].

RESULTS

[11]. Activation of AXL receptors initiates signaling
pathways involved in multiple cellular events, including
cell survival, anti-apoptosis, proliferation, migration,
and cytokine production [12]. AXL is ubiquitously
expressed in cells and organs, and its over-expression
has been reported in a wide array of human cancers,
including breast [13], lung [14], liver [15], colon [16], and
esophageal adenocarcinoma [17]. It has also been found
to be an important biomarker for prognosis of cancer.
Up-regulation of AXL is associated with poor survival of
breast cancer [18], lung adenocarcinoma [14], and acute
myeloid leukemia [19].
AXL has been reported as an adverse prognostic factor
and a therapeutic target in esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC) [20]. Knockdown of AXL inhibited invasion and
migration of EAC cells, and the AXL inhibitor R428
significantly reduced invasion and migration of EAC cells
[20]. AXL also mediates TRAIL (tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand) and cisplatin resistance in
EAC [21–23]. The crucial role of AXL in tumorigenesis and
drug resistance in ESCC has been clearly demonstrated only
very recently [24–25]. AXL was found to be consistently
over-expressed in ESCC cells and human tumor samples
[24]. Knockdown of AXL expression was shown to inhibit
cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion both in
vitro and in vivo [24]. The tumorigenic function of AXL is
mediated by activation of the Akt/NF-κB and Akt/GSK3β
pathways [24]. Over-expression of AXL also mediates
resistance to treatment with the phosphoinositide -3-kinasealpha (PI3Kα) inhibitor BYL719 by activating the EGFR/
PKC/mTOR axis in ESCC [25]. Resistance to PI3Kα can
be reversed by combined treatment with AXL, EGFR, and
PKC inhibitors [25].
HER2-targeted agents, including trastuzumab and
lapatinib, are a promising targeted therapy, especially in
treating breast cancer. Over-expression of AXL has been
shown to be a novel mechanism of acquired resistance
to HER2-targeted agents in lapatinib-resistant, HER2positive breast cancer clones [26]. Foretinib (XL880,
GSK1363089), an oral multi-kinase inhibitor acting on
AXL, c-Met, RON and VEGFR-2, can restore sensitivities
to lapatinib and trastuzumab in resistant cells [26].
Synergistic effects of foretinib with HER-targets have
been demonstrated in MET and HER1/2 co-activated
cells [27]. Meanwhile, the AXL inhibitor BMS777607 and
HER2 inhibitor lapatinib exhibit a synergistic cytotoxic
effect in breast and ovarian cancer cells [28]. However,
the prognostic role of co-expression of AXL and HER2 in
cancer cells has hardly been investigated.
Although the molecular function of AXL in ESCC
has been demonstrated, clinically there is still a lack of
evidence to support the prognostic significance of AXL
in ESCC. In our study, we investigated the prognostic
relevance of AXL and HER2 expression in operable ESCC
patients (116 cases) and the efficacy of the AXL inhibitor,
foretinib [29], in wild type and HER2-resistant ESCC
cells.

A total of 116 patients who were diagnosed with
ESCC and received surgical resection were enrolled in this
study. In this cohort, 107 patients (92.2 %) were male and
1 (0.9 %), 25 (21.5%), 54 (46.6%), and 36 (31.0%) were
diagnosed with pathologic stage 0, I, II, and III disease,
respectively. A total of 75 patients (64.6 %) were treated
with CCRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy) (Table 1).
As expected, both pathologic stage and T-stage (tumor
stage) were significantly correlated with both survival
and recurrence status of patients (P=0.001 for pathologic
stage and survival; P<0.001 for pathologic stage and
recurrence; P=0.003 for T-stage and survival and P=0.004
for T-stage and recurrence, Table 1). There were also
statistically significant differences in the distributions of
sex and CCRT treatment by survival and recurrence status
(P=0.004 and P=0.023 respectively for survival; P=0.001
and P=0.013 respectively for recurrence, Table 1). A total
of 93 patients (80.2 %) exhibited positive expression of
AXL in tumor tissue. Significant differences in mortality
and disease recurrence status were also observed between
AXL-positive patients and AXL-negative patients
(Table 1).
To analyze the correlation between AXL expression
and the prognosis of ESCC patients, we detected AXL
expression in cancerous and non-cancerous esophageal
tissues by IHC and correlated it with overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by multivariate
Cox regression analysis. Expression levels were scored
as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ (Figure 1A). AXL expression was
absent in 19.8 % of the ESCC tissue samples (score=0,
23/116); 48.3 % (56/116) of ESCC tissues showed faint
reactivity (score=1+); 24.1 % (28/116) moderate reactivity
(score=2+); and 7.8 % (9/116) diffuse and strong reactivity
(score=3) (Figure 1A and Table 2). Notably, the expression
levels of AXL were significantly elevated in cancerous
tissue compared to non-cancerous tissue (P<0.001, oneway ANOVA, Scheffe’s test, Figure 1C). Advanced tumor
tissue (stage II and III) also showed increased expression
of AXL compared to levels in early-stage tumor tissues,
but the increase did not reach statistical significance
(P=0.102, one-way ANOVA, Scheffe’s test, Figure 1C).
Expression of AXL was significantly associated with
increased risk of death (HR [95 % CI]=2.09 [1.09-4.04],
P=0.028, Table 2) and borderline significantly correlated
with disease progression (P=0.062, Table 2). Patients
with strong AXL expression (score=3+) exhibited about
a 3-fold higher risk of mortality and disease progression
(HR [95 % CI]=2.98[1.17-7.58], P=0.022 for OS; HR [95
% CI]=2.79 [1.14-6.84], P=0.025 for PFS, Table 2). Faint
expression of AXL in non-cancerous (normal, 1+, 5.6
% [5/89]) esophageal tissue also significantly correlated
with increased risks of death and disease recurrence (HR
[95 % CI]=3.63 [1.29-10.29], P=0.015 for OS; HR [95 %
CI]=2.72 [1.01-7.33], P=0.048 for PFS, Table 2).

The functional interplay between AXL and HER2
(ErbB2/Neu) has been suggested in previous studies [20,
26]. We also analyzed the prognostic relevance of HER2 in
our ESCC subjects (N=110) by IHC. Expression levels of
HER2 in ESCC were scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 1B).
Only 18.2 % (20/110) of ESCC tissues had positive IHC
staining and expression of HER2 did not correlate with
either risk of death or of recurrence (Table 2). Cumulative
analysis of the effects of expression of AXL and HER2 on
prognosis revealed that co-expression of AXL and HER2
notably increased the hazards of both death and recurrence
by more than 3-fold (HR [95 % CI]=3.43 [1.40-8.42],
P=0.007 for OS; HR [95 % CI]=3.19[1.37-7.45], P=0.007
for PFS, Table 2).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The prognostic relevance of AXL and HER2 in
ESCC were also analyzed with Kaplan-Meier estimates.
Both OS and PFS differed significantly between patients
with different levels of AXL expression (median survival
time [MST] = 47.8 vs. 13.4 vs. 12.3 vs. 7.7 months in
tissues expressing levels 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ of AXL, log-rank
P=0.008 for OS, Figure 2A; MST= 33.0 vs. 8.6 vs. 7.5 vs.
7.7 months in tissues expressing levels 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ of
AXL, log-rank P=0.040 for PFS, Figure 2B). Patients with
both AXL and HER2 expression exhibited significantly
shorter OS and PFS (MST= 47.8 vs. 13.4 vs. 11.6 months
in the AXL (-) and HER2 (-), AXL (+) or HER2 (+), and
HER2 (+) and AXL (+) subgroups, log-rank P=0.002 for
OS, Figure 2C; MST= 26.5 vs. 8.6 vs. 5.3 months in the

AXL (-) and HER2 (-), AXL (+) or HER2 (+), and HER2
(+) and AXL (+) subgroups, log-rank P=0.005 for PFS,
Figure 2D).
Patients with expression of AXL in their tumor
tissue showed significantly increased risk of distant
metastasis, a 3.96 fold increase, compared to patients
without AXL in their tumor tissue (OR [95 %CI]=3.96
(1.16-13.60), P=0.029, Table 3). Co-expression of AXL
and HER2 also increased the risk of recurrence compared
to patients with neither AXL nor HER2 expression,
however, without reaching statistical significance (OR [95
% CI]=4.11(0.59-28.46), P=0.152, Table 3). Interestingly,
the recurrence pattern of patients differed significantly

according to expression of AXL in tumor tissue. Patients
testing positive for AXL staining exhibited a significantly
increased rate of distant metastasis (the proportion with no
recurrence, local recurrence, and distant metastasis were
44.4 % vs. 16.7 % vs. 38.9 % in AXL-negative patients
and 18.1 % vs. 8.3 % vs. 73.6 % in AXL-positive patients,
respectively, P=0.017, Table 4). HER2 expression,
however, was not associated with a different recurrence
pattern (P=0.247, Table 4). Co-expression of AXL and
HER2 were also associated with an increased incidence of
distant metastasis compared to patients with neither AXL
nor HER expression (the proportion with no recurrence,
local recurrence, and distant metastasis were 1.7 % vs.

0 % vs. 25 % vs. 75 % in the AXL (+) and HER2 (+)
group, respectively, P=0.012, Table 4). That is, both AXL
expression alone and also AXL co-expression with HER2
were associated with increased risk of death and tumor
recurrence in patients with ESCC.
In the cell model, we used human ESCC cells
cultured from the CE48T cell line to analyze the
efficacy of lapatinib, a HER2 inhibitor, and of foretinib
(GSK1363089), a multikinase inhibitor of AXL, c-Met
and VEGFR-2 [29]. Figure 3A shows the relative cell
viabilities of the ESCC cells in response to the indicated
concentrations of inhibitors. ESCC cells were more
sensitive to foretinib or foretinb plus lapatinib than to

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lapatinib alone. The IC50 values were 1.891 μM, 0.443 μM
and 0.296 μM of lapatinib, foretinib, and lapatinib plus
foretinib, respectively (Figure 3A). Synergistic effects
of lapatinib and foretinib were demonstrated. The cell
viabilities were decreased to 91% and 37% in cells treated
with 1 μM of lapatinib and 1 μM of foretinib respectively.
The viability was further inhibited to 27 % by combining
1 μM of lapatinib and 1 μM foretinib (Figure 3B). The
efficacies of combined targeted therapies in ESCC cells
were also examined in two other HER2-targeted drugs,
afatinib [38] and AC480 (BMS599626) [39] (Figure 3C
and 3D). Cytotoxicity of foretinib was also increased
by treatment with either afatinib (Figure 3C) or AC480
(Figure 3D).

We also evaluated the sensitivity to foretinib in a
non-cancerous esophageal cell line, Het-1A (Figure 3E).
The IC50 of foretinib was 3.836 μM in Het-1A cells, which
was more than 4-fold higher than the value in ESCC cells
(0.823 μM). Lapatinib-resistant (HER2 resistant) subcells were selected from CE48T cells (Figure 3F) and
the IC50 value of lapatinib for these cells was measured
to be 10 times greater than for parental cells (IC50=
12.980 μM vs. 1.321 μM in HER2 resistant cells and in

parental HER2 sensitive cells respectively). Interestingly,
the HER2 resistant ESCC cells displayed sensitivity to
foretinib (IC50= 1.856 μM). Notably, AXL expression was
hardly detected in Het-1A normal esophageal cells and
was increased in HER2-resistant cells compared to the
expression level in parental ESCC cells (Figure 4A). The
activation profiles of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinase) and AKT were also analyzed. The levels
of phospho-ERK(pERK) and phospho-AKT (pAKT)

were similar in parental and HER2-resistant CE48T cells
(Figure 4A).
The activation profiles of downstream factors in
response to lapatinib and foretinib in ESCC were analyzed.
As expected, lapatinib dose-dependently and timedependently inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK in
ESCC cells (Figure 4B and Figure S1). Phosphorylation
of HER2 also decreased with increased doses of lapatinib,

which revealed the specific inhibition of HER2 activation
in ESCC cells (Figure 4B). Oncogenic function of AXL
has been demonstrated to function through activating Akt/
NF-κB and Akt/GSK3β pathways [24]. In agreement with
a previous report, we demonstrated that higher doses of
foretinib inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in ESCC cells
(Figure 4C). However, total AKT also decreased with
increased amounts of foretinib (Figure 4C). Meanwhile,

phosphorylation levels of AXL and ERK were also
reduced with elevated amounts of foretinib (Figure 4C).
Thus, foretinib might induce cytotoxicity of ESCC cells
through specific inhibition of AXL activation and of the
signaling cascades of PI3K/AKT and Ras/ERK.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the molecular
collaboration of AXL/14-3-3ζ and TGF-β/Smad signaling
on cancer progression has been demonstrated [51].
TGF-β1 is an upstream factor of EMT [52] and has been
shown to be induced by environmental carcinogens, such
as tobacco smoking [53], alcohol drinking [54] and betel
nut chewing [55–56]. Incidence of ESCC is well-known
to highly correlate with these environmental carcinogens.
Among our study population, over 90 % of patients have
at least one of these unfavorable habits. Interestingly, in
our patients, 90.5 % of betel nut chewers were positive
for AXL in tumor tissue, which was significantly higher
than in non-chewers (P=0.029, data not shown). Such
results suggest that these environmental carcinogens might
increase the level of TGF-β1 and thus contribute to the
over-expression of AXL in esophageal tissue.
Expression of HER2 is highly correlated with the
prognosis of esophageal adenocarcinom [6], while the
prognostic role in ESCC has hardly been investigated. We
found that about 20 % of our patients were positive for
HER2. Even though expression of HER2 alone did not
associate with the clinical outcome of ESCC, cumulative
expression of AXL and HER2 showed significant clinical
impact on ESCC. AXL expression was increased in HER2resistant ESCC cells compared to expression in HER2sensitive ESCC cells revealing the interplay of AXL and
HER2 in ESCC.
The activity of foretinib was demonstrated in a
phase II trial in patients with advanced papillary renal
cell carcinoma (PRCC), especially in those with germline
MET mutations [57]. Because c-Met is also an adverse
prognostic factor for ESCC [58], we suggest foretinib has
great potential for ESCC targeted therapy in patients overexpressing AXL or c-Met. The synergistic cytotoxicity
of foretinib with HER2 inhibitors, including lapatinib,
afatinib, and AC480 have also been demonstrated in ESCC
cells. Combination therapy of AXL and HER2 inhibitors
is, therefore, a possible direction in ESCC patients cooverexpressing AXL and HER2.
Collectively, our results provide clinical evidence
that AXL is a strong adverse prognostic factor, which is
significantly correlated with pathological stage, overall
survival, and distant metastasis of operable ESCC.
Therapeutic agents targeting AXL, therefore, have great
potential to improve the clinical outcome of operable
ESCC.

DISCUSSION
ESCC is a deadly cancer with poor prognosis
and no clinically approved targeted therapy. The EGFR
(epidermal growth factor receptor)-targeted drugs,
gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were evaluated
in esophageal cancer in phase II and phase III studies [42–
45]. Other targeting agents have been studied for treatment
of ESCC, though most have been restricted to pre-clinical
tests or phase I studies [46]. A growing body of studies
has demonstrated the promise of AXL as a novel target for
cancer targeted therapy, including in esophageal cancer. In
our current study, we provide further clinical evidence of
the oncogenic role of AXL in ESCC. We found that AXL
expression was significantly elevated in tumor tissues
and associated with pathological stage (Figure 1). Overexpression of AXL increased risk of death (Table 2 and
Figure 2), and distant metastasis of ESCC (Table 3 and
4). Patients positive for AXL have about a 2-fold greater
hazard of death and about a 4-fold increased risk of disease
recurrence. The median survival time was also drastically
decreased from 47 months to less than 14 months.
In our operable ESCC patients, the rate of positive
AXL expression in ESCC tissue was about 80 %, which
was markedly higher than in adjacent normal esophageal
tissue (5.6 %). AXL expression has been found to be
induced by chemotherapy drugs in U937 acute myeloid
leukemia cells [47]. About 65 % of our patients were
treated with operative neoadjuvant CCRT, which makes
reasonable the speculation that AXL expression may have
been induced by CCRT. However, the rate of AXL-positive
samples were not significantly different between patients
who received CCRT and those who did not (positive and
negative rates were 84.2 % vs. 15.8 % and 78.2 % vs.
21.8 % in the CCRT [-] and CCRT [+] groups respectively,
P=0.446, Table S1). CCRT treatment did not correlate with
the expression of HER2 in ESCC either (P=1.000, Table
S1). Thus, CCRT was not a major factor in inducing the
expression of AXL or HER2 in ESCC tissues.
AXL expression has been found to be induced by
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to correlate
with induction of EMT in breast cancer [18, 48] and
in ESCC [49]. EMT is a critical factor in promoting
metastasis. Our results demonstrated that AXL expression
significantly correlated with incidence of distant
metastasis, providing strong clinical support for the crucial
role of AXL in ESCC metastasis.
AXL has also been suggested as a downstream
effector of transforming growth factor-beta 1
(TGF-β1) during langerhans cell differentiation [50].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Our study subjects were collected in the pathological
and surgical department of National Taiwan University
Hospital from 2005 to 2013. The consent procedure of
the clinical study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital
36965

Oncotarget

(201402056RINA). The inclusion criteria were patients
aged above 20 years who were histologically confirmed
with primary ESCC and received surgical resection. The
exclusion criteria were pregnant women, those unwilling
to give informed consent, and those without complete
clinical records. Surgical resection of esophagectomy with
two or three field lymph node dissection and esophageal
reconstruction were performed in all of the recruited
patients.
CCRT was administered to patients with advanced
TNM stages (IIb or more advanced) diagnosed by
endoscopic ultrasound or computed tomography before
surgery. The CCRT procedures were described in a
previous study [30–31]. Information regarding the
demographics, disease characteristics (tumor location,
TNM stage), histology, clinical treatments, recurrence
status, and survival were obtained from the Tumor
Registry of the National Taiwan University Hospital
and/or medical chart-review. The TNM staging of the
patients receiving CCRT was re-staged according to the
pathological reports after surgery [32]. Overall survival
duration (OS) was defined as the interval between
esophagectomy and either death from disease or last
follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as
the interval between esophagectomy (complete resection)
and detection of local recurrence or distant metastasis of
the tumor.

medium (Lonza). All the cells were cultured at 37°C in an
incubator containing 5% CO2.

Isolation of HER2-resistant ESCC cells
HER2-resistant ESCC sub-cells were selected by
repeated treatment with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib
(Tykerb, synthesized by Selleckchem, S2111) [36] of
different concentrations (5 to 20 μM/L). Briefly, the 50
% and 90 % inhibition concentrations (IC50 and IC90) of
lapatinib for a 72 hour treatment period were determined.
The parental cells were then treated with the IC90 dose for
24 hours. After removing the medium, the cells were then
maintained and regrown in medium containing the IC50
dose of lapatinib. When cells covered 60-70 % of the dish
surface, the cells were re-incubated with an increased
concentration (1.5 fold) of the drug. Cells resistant to 20
μM/L of lapatinib were harvested and were subjected to
cell viability assay.

Cell viability assay
The CE48T/VGH cells, lapatinib-resistant sub-cells
and Het-1A cells were plated on 96-well plates (8000
cells/well) and treated with the indicated amounts of AXL
inhibitor, foretinib [37] (GSK1363089, provided by Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. SC-364492) or HER2 inhibitors.
The HER2 inhibitors included lapatinib, afatinib [38]
(Tovok, provided by Boehringer Ingelheim, Taiwan), and
AC480 [39] (BMS599626, synthesized by Selleckchem,
S1056). After incubation for 72 hours, cell survival was
determined by MTT assay as described previously [40–41].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks
with ESCC and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples
were obtained from the Department of Pathology in
our hospital. Briefly, FFPE tissue sections (4 μm) were
dewaxed and rehydrated. After antigen retrieval at 37°C
for 2 hours in a Ventana BenchMark XT processor
(Ventana, Tucson, AZ), tissue sections on the slides were
incubated with primary antibodies. After reincubation
with polymer-horseradish peroxidase reagent, the
sections were visualized with Ventana ultraview DAB
(diaminobenzidine 3,3′ tetrahydrochloride) detection kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The primary
antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody against
AXL (1:100, ab72069, abcam) and HER2 (ready- to-use,
DAKO). The tissue slides were then counterstained with
hematoxylin.

Protein extraction and western blotting
To detect protein expression in the esophageal cells,
total protein was extracted from the cells by RIPA buffer
(150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 1 % IgepalCA630, 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, 50 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3VaO4, and complete protease inhibitor
cocktail). Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and western blotting with specific antibodies as described
previously [40–41]. The primary antibodies for protein
detection were anti-AXL rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb)
(ab72069, Abcam), anti-phospho-AXL (Tyr702, D12B2)
rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb) (#5724, Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-HER2 rabbit antibody (#2242, Cell
signaling), anti-phospho -HER2/ErbB2 (Tyr1221/1222,
6B12) pAb (#2243, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Actin
mAb (clone C4, Millipore), anti-ERK 1 (K-23) (Santa
Cruz), anti-phospho-p44/42 Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) mAb
(#4370, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Akt antibody
(#9272, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Akt
(Ser473) (#9271, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-αTubulin (DM1A, Abcam).

Cell culture
CE48T/VGH (CE48T, BCRC 60165), a human
ESCC cell line derived from a 57 year-old Taiwanese
man [33–34], was cultured in RPMI complete medium.
Het-1A, a non-tumorigenic primary esophageal squamous
cell line, was transformed by SV40 T antigen [35] and
was cultured on CellBind dishes (Corning) in BEGM

The distribution of demographic variables, clinical
characteristics, and indicated protein expression levels
among the subgroups with different prognostic results
were compared using a Pearson χ2 test or Fisher exact
test (N≤ 5). Protein expression levels of esophageal
tissues among non-tumor and tumor tissue of different
stages were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and boxplot. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to
evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) of death and disease
progression adjusted for potential significant clinical
covariates and indicated protein expression. The odds
ratios (ORs) obtained from logistic regression were used
to describe association of distant metastasis and protein
expression profiles. Data were expressed as mean value
and 95% confidence interval (CI). Crude correlations
between genotypes and OS or PFS were assessed using the
Kaplan-Meier survival function and compared using the
log-rank test. All statistical analyses were conducted with
SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Institute, Chicago, IL). A p-value ≤ 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Sigmoidal doseresponse curve and the corresponding IC50 and IC90 values
were generated by Graph-Pad Prism software (Graph-Pad
soft ware, Inc.).
