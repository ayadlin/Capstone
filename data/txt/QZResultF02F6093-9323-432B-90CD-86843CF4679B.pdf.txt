The DNp73 proteins act as trans-repressors of p53 and
p73-dependent transcription and exert both anti-apoptotic
activity and pro-proliferative activity. DNp73s are
frequently up-regulated in a variety of human cancers,
including human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).
Increased levels of DNp73 proteins confer to HCC cells
resistance to apoptosis and, irrespective to p53 status, a
chemoresistant phenotype. Here, we show that interferon
(IFN)a down-regulates DNp73 expression in primary
human hepatocytes (PHHs) and HCC cell lines. IFNa has
been used as pro-apoptotic agent in the treatment of
malignancies and there is increasing evidence of IFNa
effectiveness in HCC treatment and prevention of
recurrence. The precise mechanisms by which class I
IFNs exert their anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity
remain unclear. IFNa binding to its receptor activates
multiple intracellular signaling cascades regulating the
transcription of numerous direct target genes through the
recruitment of a complex comprising of STAT1, STAT2
and IFN regulatory factor (IRF)9 to their promoters. We
found that, in response to IFNa, the P2p73 promoter
undergoes substantial chromatin remodeling. Histone
deacetylases (HDACs) replace histone acetyl transferases. STAT2 is recruited onto the endogenous P2p73
promoter together with the polycomb group protein Ezh2,
leading to increased H3K27 methylation and transcriptional repression. The reduction of DNp73 levels by IFNa
is paralleled by an increased susceptibility to IFNatriggered apoptosis of Huh7 hepatoma cells. Our results
show, for the ﬁrst time, that IFN-stimulated gene factor 3
recruitment may serve both in activating and repressing
gene expression and identify the down-regulation of
DNp73 as an additional mechanism to counteract the
chemoresistance of liver cancer cells.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
frequent solid tumors worldwide and represents the
third cause of cancer mortality (Fattovich et al., 2004;
El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007). Cytotoxic chemotherapy
has proven largely ineffective and several mechanisms
have been proposed to explain HCC chemoresistance
in vivo. p53 status is one important determinant of the
response of tumor cells to anti-cancer drugs that trigger
apoptosis by inducing DNA damage. In HCC, patients
exposed to the aﬂatoxin B1 mycotoxin a ‘hot spot’
mutation at codon 249, leading to the expression of the
R249S DNA binding defective p53 mutant protein, is
found in up to 50–70% of cases (Moradpour and Blum,
2005; El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007). In regions where
aﬂatoxin levels in food are low or undetectable, p53
mutation are rarely observed (4–8% of HCCs) and no
speciﬁc P53 gene mutation pattern can been detected
(Moradpour and Blum, 2005; El-Serag and Rudolph,
2007). More recently the p53 family genes TP63 and
TP73 have been implicated in both tumorigenesis and in
the response to chemo and radiotherapies (Stiewe, 2007;
Lunghi et al., 2009). The p53 family genes produce
multiple isoforms that differ in their NH2-termini and
can be functionally grouped into dominant negative
(DN) and trans-activation competent (TA) proteins
(Levrero et al., 2000; Melino et al., 2002; Stiewe, 2007).
p53, TAp73 and TAp63 share the ability to activate
transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. The DNp73 proteins lack the N-terminal
trans-activation domain and act as trans-repressors of
p53 and p63/p73-dependent transcription showing both
anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative potential (Vossio
et al., 2002). DNp73 proteins are generated either by
alternative exon splicing of the P1p73 promoter
transcript (DEx2p73, DEx2/3p73 and DN’p73) or via
the alternative use of a second intragenic promoter
located in intron 3 (P2p73) (Levrero et al., 2000; Stiewe
et al., 2004). DNp73 proteins are up-regulated in a
variety of human cancers and accumulate progressively

in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, conferring to
HCC cells a chemoresistant phenotype (Stiewe et al.,
2004; Mu+ller et al., 2005; Levrero, 2006).
Interferons (IFNs) have been used in the treatment of
several malignancies including myeloma, melanoma,
renal and bladder cancer. IFNa has also been proposed
both in the prevention and treatment of HCC (Chattopadhyay et al., 2007). Although the impact of IFNbased therapies to prevent HCC development in
cirrhotic patients is still highly controversial (Craxı̀
and Cammà, 2005; Shiratori et al., 2005; Lok et al.,
2009), recent studies have shown clinical efﬁcacy of
IFNa alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic
agents in the treatment of advanced HCCs with portal
vein tumor thrombosis and/or extrahepatic metastasis
(Obi et al., 2006; Uka et al., 2008). Moreover, in
randomized clinical trials, IFNa has been shown to
prevent HCC recurrence and to improve survival after
curative treatments in early HCCs (Breitenstein et al.,
2009; Miyake et al., 2010). The molecular mechanisms
underlying IFNa anti-tumor activity are still unclear.
Type I interferons (IFNa/b) are multifunctional cytokines that mediate host defense against microbial
challenges, modulate innate and adaptive immune
responses and inﬂuence both normal and neoplastic
proliferation (Pestka et al., 2004) through the activation
of multiple intracellular signaling cascades (Uddin and
Platanias, 2004) and the transcriptional activation of
downstream IFN-sensitive genes (ISGs), including a
number of genes involved in the modulation of
apoptosis (Chawla-Sarkar et al., 2003). Here, we show
that IFNa down-regulates DNp73 expression in primary
human hepatocytes (PHHs) and HCC cell lines through
the co-recruitment of STAT2 and the Ezh2 transcription
repressor onto the endogenous P2p73 promoter. The
reduction of DNp73 levels induced by IFNa is paralleled
by an increased susceptibility to IFNa-triggered apoptosis
of Huh7 hepatoma cells. These results show, for the ﬁrst
time, that IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) recruitment may serve both in activating and repressing gene
expression and identify the down-regulation of DNp73
as an additional mechanism to counteract the chemoresistance of liver cancer cells.

which shows detectable basal levels of DNp73 mRNA
and protein. Although Huh7 cells have been described
to harbor a defective IFN response to inﬂuenza A,
vesicular stomatitis virus or Sendai viruses infection
(Keskinen et al., 1999), the components of the IFN class
I signaling pathway are conserved although relatively
high concentrations of exogenous IFNa are required to
activate the ISGs (Melén et al., 2000). The transcriptional activity of class I IFNs is mediated by the binding
of the ISGF3 trimeric transcription complex, that is
comprised of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 (Fu et al.,
1990), to the sequence-speciﬁc ISREs sites located in the
regulatory regions of target genes. STAT2 recruitment
in the ISGF3 complex is speciﬁcally associated with
Type I IFN-dependent signaling (Leung et al., 1995) and
can be, therefore, used to track IFNa-induced ISGF3
binding to target ISRE elements.
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that in IFNa-treated Huh7 cells
STAT2 is rapidly phosphorylated (Supplementary
Figure S1a) and translocates to the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S1b), where it is recruited onto the
promoter region of the IFN-regulated gene ISG15
(Supplementary Figure S1c) to stimulate its transcription (Supplementary Figure S1d). These results are in
agreement with previous results obtained in Huh7 cells
exposed to exogenous IFNa and showing the recruitment in vivo of both STAT1 and STAT2 onto several
ISRE-regulated genes (Testoni et al., submitted).
As shown in Figure 1b, the activity of a P2p73
promoter luciferase reporter is strongly repressed in
response to IFNa treatment in Huh7 cells. Using
different luciferase reporter constructs carrying P2p73
deletions (Vossio et al., 2002) (Figure 1a), we found that
the 306/ þ 76 construct lacking the upstream ISRE (II)
site continues to be repressed by IFNa, indicating that
the core ISRE (I) site is sufﬁcient to mediate IFNa
repression of the P2p73 promoter (Figure 1b). Similar
results were obtained in Huh6 and HepG2 cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S2). Next, we showed that in
IFNa-treated Huh7 cells and PHH, DNp73 mRNA
levels, measured by an isoform-speciﬁc real-time PCR,
decline progressively and are reduced by 80% 8 h after
stimulation (Figure 1c). Altogether, these results indicate that the activity of the endogenous P2p73
promoter is repressed by IFNa and that this effect is
not inﬂuenced by the p53 status.

IFNa-induced repression of DNp73 correlates with
apoptosis induction
IFNa induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells (Fujioka
et al., 2006; Herzer et al., 2009) and induction of
TRAIL, the ligand for the DR4 and DR5 death
receptors, has been proposed to have a role (Herzer
et al., 2009). We found that exposure of Huh7 cells to
IFNa (1000 IU/ml) induces apoptosis, as shown by the
increased percentage of sub-G1 population at propidium iodide ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis (Figure 2a) and the accumulation of cleaved
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragment (Figure 2b).

IFNa treatment in the absence of changes in cell cycle
dynamics (Figure 2a, right panel). The accumulation of
cleaved PARP in response to IFNa started at 8 h, when
the protein levels of DNp73 begin to decrease, and it
was evident at 12 h when the peak DNp73 protein downregulation (70–80%) is observed (Figure 2b). The role of
DNp73 in the modulation of IFNa-induced apoptosis is
supported by the observation that its over-expression
abrogates Huh7 apoptosis response after exposure to
IFNa (Figures 2c and d). In view of the established antiapoptotic activity of DNp73 potential in a variety of
human cells (Vossio et al., 2002; Stiewe, 2007) and its
frequent up-regulation in human HCCs (Mu+ller et al.,
2005) these results suggest that reduction of DNp73
expression might contribute to IFNa apoptotic activity.
DNp73 is a direct IFNa/STAT2 transcriptional target gene
Next, we investigated the in vivo occupancy of the ISRE
sites in the P2p73 promoter by STAT2 in untreated and
IFNa-treated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays show that STAT2 is recruited in vivo in
Huh7 cells on ISRE (I) site 30 min after exposure to
IFNa (Figure 3a, left panel) and an ISGF3 complex
Oncogene

containing the phosphorylated form STAT2 is present
on the promoter after 1 h stimulation (Figure 3b, left panel).
No STAT2 or P-STAT2 recruitment was observed on the
ISRE (II) site (Figures 3a and b, right panel), supporting
the notion that the core ISRE (I) element is sufﬁcient to
mediate STAT2/IFNa transcriptional activity. These
results were also conﬁrmed in human primary hepatocytes, where the phosphorylated form of STAT2 is
detected on the core ISRE (I) element after 1 h of IFNa
treatment (Figure 3c, left panel). The ISRE (II) site again
displays no relevant increase in STAT2 recruitment after
IFNa (Figure 3c, right panel). To further conﬁrm the
role of ISRE (I) in mediating IFNa repression of P2p73,
we tested a 827/ þ 76 luciferase reporter construct
carrying a deletion between nucleotide þ 32 and þ 44
with respect to transcription start site (tss) (corresponding to the core conserved ISRE (I) nucleotides
(Kessler et al., 1988)). As shown in Figure 3d,
the -827DISRE-luc is only marginally repressed by
IFNa. Altogether these results indicate that the recruitment of STAT2 and its phosphorylated form
is associated with the transcriptional repression of
the P2p73 promoter and that the core ISRE (I) site
mediates IFNa transcriptional repression in vivo.

H3K27 methylation mediates IFNa-induced repression of
the P2p73 promoter
The notion of IFNa-repressed genes is increasingly
recognized (Radaeva et al., 2002) but the mechanistic
basis for their transcriptional repression is not clear so
far. The well-established model of IFNa signaling
through its receptor binding, phosphorylation of STATs
and ISGF3 complex formation and recruitment to
target promoters is fully demonstrated for activated
ISGs (Levy and Darnell, 2002), while the efforts to
unveil IFNa-dependent repression of few genes, namely
c-MET and hTERT, fail to ﬁnd a direct transcriptional
role of STATs (Xu et al., 2000; Radaeva et al., 2002). In
an attempt to correlate the recruitment of STAT2 on the
P2p73 promoter and IFNa-induced repression of
DNp73 expression we performed additional chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments to assess whether the
combinatorial action of other transcription factors
and/or the co-recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors
might be involved to convert an a priori active chromatinbound STAT2 complex into a repressive one.

ChIP experiments in Huh7 cells have shown that
histone 3 and 4 acetylation (AcH3 and AcH4) are
sharply reduced at the ISRE (I) site after exposure to
IFNa, concurrent with a decrease in the binding of both
the acetyl transferase p300 and serine phosphorylated
RNA polymerase II to the same promoter region
(Figure 4a, left panel). We also found that histone 3
methylation on lysine 27 is increased at the ISRE (I) site
1 h after IFNa treatment (Figure 4a, right panel).
As H3K27 methylation is the hallmark of the transcriptional repression mediated by Ezh2, a polycomb group
(PcG) chromatin-modifying enzyme with histone
lysine methyl transferase activity (Caretti et al., 2004;
Montgomery et al., 2005; Margueron et al., 2009), we
veriﬁed its recruitment on the P2p73 promoter in IFNatreated Huh7 cells (Figure 4a, right panel). Ezh2 is part
of the PcG repressive complex 2 whose transcriptional
repressive activity is also mediated by the interaction
and co-recruitment of HDACs (Van der Vlag and Otte,
1999). As shown in Figure 4a (right panel), Ezh2

Figure 3 DNp73 is a direct STAT2 transcriptional target gene. (a) STAT2 is recruited onto the ISRE (I) element in the P2p73
promoter in response to IFNa. Chromatin from untreated and IFNa-treated (1000 UI/ml for the indicated times) Huh7 cells was
immunoprecipitated with either the relevant control IgG or an anti-STAT2 antibody and PCR analyzed with primers amplifying the
regions containing ISRE (I) (left panel) and ISRE (II) (right panel) sites in the P2p73 promoter. Results are expressed as speciﬁc
enrichment (% of input values on ISRE sites divided for % of input values on the control (CTL) region) (see Materials and methods
section for more details). (b) ISRE (I) bound complexes after IFNa treatment are enriched in phospho-STAT2. Chromatin was
prepared as in (a), immunoprecipitated with a speciﬁc anti-phosphorylated-STAT2 antibody and PCR analyzed with primers
amplifying the regions containing ISRE (I) (left panel) and ISRE (II) (right panel) sites in the P2p73 promoter. ChIP-speciﬁc
enrichment is calculated as in (a). (c) STAT2 and phospho-STAT2 are recruited in vivo onto the ISRE (I) site in the P2p73 promoter in
PHHs exposed to IFNa. Chromatin was prepared from untreated and IFNa-treated (1000 UI/ml for the indicated times) PHH,
immunoprecipitated with either anti-STAT2 or anti-phospho-STAT2 antibodies and PCR analyzed with P2p73 ISRE (I) (left panel)
and ISRE (II) (right panel)-speciﬁc primers. Results are expressed as in (a). (d) ISRE (I) deletion abrogates IFNa-driven P2p73
repression. Huh7 cells were transfected with 300 ng of the 827DISRE-luc, exposed to IFNa (1000 UI/ml) for 18 h and cell extracts
from untreated and IFNa-treated cells were tested for luciferase activity. Results are expressed as relative activity to the untreated
control after normalization for transfection efﬁciency using the dual luciferase assay system. Histograms show the mean values of three
experiments each performed in triplicate; bars indicate s.d.

is paralleled by an increase in HDAC1 binding. To
functionally link IFNa-induced recruitment of Ezh2
and chromatin changes at the P2p73 promoter with its
transcriptional repression we made abrogated Ezh2
expression using speciﬁc small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).
Depletion by 50% (Figure 4b, lower panel) of Ezh2 in
Huh7 cells prevented IFNa-induced repression of the
827/ þ 76 P2p73-luc reporter construct (Figure 4b, upper
panel). Altogether these data indicate that in response
to IFNa treatment there is a profound re-shufﬂing of
transcription cofactors and chromatin in order to establish
a repressive state at the P2p73 promoter.
This is also the ﬁrst indication of active ISGF3
recruitment onto the promoter region of an IFNaregulated gene being associated to transcriptional
repression. Importantly, our data indicate that recruitment of the phosphorylated ‘active’ form of STAT2 is
required for establishing transcriptional repression.
Discussion
IFNa, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs, has been used with variable efﬁcacy in the
Oncogene

treatment of different malignancies including HCC.
IFNa has been shown to prevent the growth of
preneoplastic lesions and to inhibit the development of
HCC in rat models of hepatocarcinogenesis (Nakaji
et al., 2004), to exert an inhibitory effect on tumor
growth in an HCC cell line xenograft model (Noguchi
et al., 2008) and to act negatively on cell proliferation of
murine hepatic progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo (Lim
et al., 2006). The anti-tumor effects of class I IFNs are
thought to be mediated either by indirectly modulating
immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic responses or
by directly affecting proliferation or cellular differentiation of tumor cells. Accordingly, in the HCC setting
IFNa inhibits cells growth (Fujioka et al., 2006) and
induces apoptosis (Herzer et al., 2009) of hepatoma cells
in vitro but also displays anti-angiogenesis effects
mediated by a reduction of VEGF synthesis and a
decrease of intra-tumoral CD31 þ endothelial cells
(Nakaji et al., 2004). Both direct or indirect anti-tumor
effects of IFNs result from the transcriptional regulation
of speciﬁc subsets of ISGs (Chawla-Sarkar et al., 2003).
Oligonucleotide microarray studies have greatly enlarged the spectrum of ISGs that are either activated
or repressed in response to IFNa in different normal

and neoplastic cell lineages. In addition to the ISGs
implicated in anti-viral, anti-angiogenic, immunomodulatory and cell cycle inhibitory effects, a number of ISGs
with apoptotic functions have been identiﬁed. These
include tumor necrosis factor-a-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L), Fas/FasL, XIAP-associated factor-1, caspase-4, caspase-8, dsRNA activated
protein kinase, 20 , 50 -oligoadenylate synthetase, death

activating protein kinases, phospholipid scramblase,
galectin 9, many IRFs, the promyelocytic leukemia gene
and regulators of IFN-induced death (Chawla-Sarkar
et al., 2003).
The mechanisms, genes and regulatory networks
involved in IFNa-mediated apoptosis in HCC patients
and in hepatoma cells are still poorly elucidated.

response to IFNa as adjuvant therapy was higher in the
subgroup of male patients with overall poor prognosis
displaying low expression of miR26a and miR26b and a
distinct transcriptomic signature with the activation of
NF-kB and IL6 signaling pathways (Ji et al., 2009).
Recently, the DR4/DR5 death receptors ligand TRAIL
and the promyelocytic leukemia protein have also been
shown to have an important role in mediating, in a p53
independent manner, IFNa-induced apoptosis in HCC
cells (Herzer et al., 2009). In our work we correlate
IFNa-induced apoptosis with its ability to repress
DNp73, a DN isoform of the p53 family member p73.
DNp73 exerts a potent anti-apoptotic activity in a
variety of human cells (Vossio et al., 2002; Stiewe, 2007)
and it is up-regulated in human HCCs (Mu+ller et al.,
2005), thus suggesting that its repression might contribute to IFNa apoptotic activity. We show that IFNa
down-regulates DNp73 expression in PHHs and HCC
cell lines by causing substantial chromatin remodeling
of the P2p73 promoter in vivo as assessed by ChIP
experiments. HDAC1 is recruited onto the IFN
responsive element ISRE (I) in the P2p73 promoter
whereas p300 acetyl transferase occupancy and histone
acetylation is reduced. These changes are coincident
with the binding of a STAT2-containing ISGF3 complex together with the PcG transcription repressor Ezh2,
leading to increased H3K27 methylation and transcriptional repression. The role of Ezh2 in mediating IFNainduced repression of the P2p73 promoter was further
conﬁrmed by the ability of speciﬁc anti-Ezh2 siRNA to
prevent IFNa inhibitory activity. Interestingly, PcG
repressive complex 2 and Ezh2 over-expression has been
reported in HCCs (Sudo et al., 2005; Steele et al., 2006;
Yonemitsu et al., 2009) and associated with more
aggressive tumors (Sudo et al., 2005; Steele et al.,
2006). Altogether our data represent the ﬁrst demonstration of recruitment of an ISGF3 complex onto the
promoter region of an IFNa-regulated gene being
associated to transcriptional repression. Importantly,
the recruitment of the phosphorylated ‘active’ form of
STAT2 is required for establishing transcriptional
repression. In an attempt to speculate about the
mechanism by which the P2p73 ISRE (I) might supports
a ‘transcriptionally repressive’ vs ‘active’ ISGF3-containing complexes, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence
and position of ISRE sites directly bound by STAT2 in
ChIp-chip analysis and derived from several ISGs
activated or repressed by IFNa in Huh7 cells (Testoni
et al., submitted). As shown in Supplementary Figure S3,
the graphical representation of the multiple sequences
alignment does not show any signiﬁcant difference in
nucleotide composition or conservation between activated and repressed genes. On the other hand, it is worth
to note that in the activated targets, all the ISREs are
located between 0 and 200 from tss, while in the
repressed group, the ISREs are far upstream or downstream. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that the nucleotide composition of ISREs accounts for the ‘choice’
between activating and repressing complexes, whereas
we can hypothesize a ‘position effect’ on the role of
ISREs sites in triggering a positive or negative
Oncogene

transcriptional effect. A genome-wide approach combining in silico analysis, chromatin studies and expression proﬁling will be needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis.
The identiﬁcation of genes targeted by IFNa in the liver
and the cellular pathways associated with clinical response
to IFNa may both help in deﬁning those patients that
would beneﬁt more from IFNa treatment in different
clinical settings (that is, prevention of recurrence in early
HCCs, ﬁrst/second line treatment of advanced or metastatic
tumors). IFNa-induced down-regulation of DNp73 may
represent an additional mechanism to counteract the
chemoresistance of liver cancer cells.

Materials and methods
Cell cultures and IFNa treatments
Huh7 (codon 220 mutated p53), HepG2 (wt p53) and Huh6
(wt p53) hepatoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco-Life Tech, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% penicillin/
streptomycine and 1% glutamine (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA). IFNa was used at a ﬁnal concentration of 1000 IU/ml
and added directly to the culture medium.
Liver tissue samples and primary culture of human hepatocytes
PHHs were prepared from adult patients undergoing lobectomy or segmental liver resection for medically required
purposes unrelated to this research program. The use of these
human hepatic specimens for scientiﬁc purposes has been
approved by the French National Ethic Committee. The PHHs
used in this study were obtained from two patients: FT304, a
52-year-old female transplant donor and FT310, a 60-year-old
female, undergoing liver resection for a cystadenoma. Both patients
were negative for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human
immunodeﬁciency virus serologic markers. PHHs were prepared
and cultured as described elsewhere (Pichard-Garcia et al.,
2002). The cells were plated into collagen-coated dishes (BD
Biosciences, Billerica, MA, USA) at 1.7  105 cells/cm2 in a
hormonally and chemically deﬁned medium (Pichard-Garcia
et al., 2002). Forty-eight hours after plating, cells were cultured
in the presence or absence of IFNa at 1000 U/ml for 1 h.
RNA extraction and qRT–PCR
Sub-conﬂuent Huh7 cells were treated with 1000 IU/ml of
IFNa and total mRNAs were extracted at different time points
(RNAeasy mini kit—Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Reverse
transcription was performed using the random hexamers method
(Superscript II kit—Invitrogen-Life Tech, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RNA quality and quantity were monitored by ethidium-bromide
staining and by UV adsorbance. Real-time PCRs were run in a
7900HT machine using Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA, #Hs_010652727_m1 for DNp73). 18S
was used to normalize equal loading of each sample (Applied
Biosystems #Hs_99999901_s1).
Small interfering RNA
RNA interference was obtained using the a-Ezh2 and Control
SmartPool siRNAs (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA). Cells
were harvested 48 h after transfection.
Western blot analysis
Sub-conﬂuent Huh7 cells, treated with 1000 IU/ml of IFNa, were
harvested at the different time points in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8,

120 mM NaCl, 1 mM diothiothreitol, 0.5% NP40, 1  PIC
(Sigma, Inc) for protein extraction. Protein concentration was
determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein lysates
were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated
with the following antibodies: P-STAT1 (#9171 Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), P-STAT2 (#07–224 Upstate, Lake Placid,
NY, USA); DNp73 (#MG-313 Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA),
cleaved PARP (#9541 Cell Signaling) and tubulin (#MS-719
NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA, USA).
DNA transfection and luciferase assay
Luciferase activity was measured in sub-conﬂuent Huh7 cells
transfected with the different P2p73 promoter constructs using
the Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, 3 h posttransfection the medium was replaced with 10% serum
supplemented DMEM plus 1000 IU/ml of IFNa. After
additional 18 h, cells were collected and the cell extracts were
analyzed for luciferase activity. The P2p73 promoter deletion
mutants and the pcDNA3-DNp73 expression vector were
described previously (Vossio et al., 2002; Belloni et al., 2006).

Biosystems, Inc). The primers used were: ISRE (I)for:
CGGGTTTTGTTGTTGGATTCA; ISRE (I)rev: GCATTTT
CGCTTTTCCCATCT; ISRE (II)for: AAGCAGGCAGGTG
GTTTGG; ISRE (II)rev: CGGAGACCCTTTCCCCTTT;
CTLfor: CCCCCACTCAGCCTTTCC; CTL_rev: TGCAGC
CCCAAAGTGCTT. Dissociation curves after ampliﬁcation
showed that all primer pairs generated single products. The
amount of PCR product ampliﬁed was calculated as percent of
a standard curve of the input. A 3000-bp upstream region from
the P2p73 ATG was used as negative internal control and
percent of input values on ISRE sites were divided for percent
of input values on CTL region to obtain the speciﬁc
enrichment.
Antibodies used in ChIP
The antibodies used in ChIP were phospho-STAT2 (#07-224
Upstate), STAT2 (sc-476), p300 (sc-585), PolII (sc-9001 Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Ezh2 (#3147 Cell
Signaling), HDAC1 (#H3284 Sigma), AcH3 (#07-352), AcH4
(#06-866 Upstate) and H3K27me3 (#ab6002 Abcam, Cambridge,
CA, USA).

ISRE mutagenesis
827DISRE-luc construct was developed from 827/ þ 76
promoter as described previously. The deletion between
nucleotide þ 32 and þ 44 after tss was obtained using the
Quickchange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA, USA, #200518) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The construct was conﬁrmed by sequencing.

FACS analysis of DNA content
After IFNa treatment, cells were harvested, ﬁxed in EtOH
70%, washed and re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
1  . Propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) and RNase A (1 mg/ml) were
added and incubated for 1 h at 37 1C before FACS reading
(Nicoletti et al., 1991).

ChIP and real-time PCR quantiﬁcation
ChIP analysis was based on the protocol described in Testoni
et al. (2006). Brieﬂy, cells (0.5/1  108) were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min with 1%
formaldehyde; after quenching the reaction with glycine
0.125 M, cells were sonicated and chromatin fragments of an
average length of 1 kb recovered by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed with ProtG–Sepharose (KPL)
and 3–5 mg of the indicated antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, washings and reverse cross-linking, samples were
extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, once with chloroform
and ethanol precipitated in the presence of 30 mg of glycogen.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBRGreen ROX mix, and an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection
System according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied
