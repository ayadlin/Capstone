ABSTRACT
Inhibition of Aurora kinase activity by small molecules is being actively
investigated as a potential anti-cancer strategy. A successful therapeutic use of Aurora
inhibitors relies on a comprehensive understanding of the effects of inactivating
Aurora kinases on cell division, a challenging aim given the pleiotropic roles of those
kinases during mitosis. Here we have used the Aurora-A inhibitor MLN8237, currently
under phase-I/III clinical trials, in dose-response assays in U2OS human cancer cells
synchronously proceeding towards mitosis. By following the behaviour and fate of
single Aurora-inhibited cells in mitosis by live microscopy, we show that MLN8237
treatment affects multiple processes that are differentially sensitive to the loss of
Aurora-A function. A role of Aurora-A in controlling the orientation of cell division
emerges. MLN8237 treatment, even in high doses, fails to induce efficient elimination
of dividing cells, or of their progeny, while inducing significant aneuploidy in daughter
cells. The results of single-cell analyses show a complex cellular response to MLN8237
and evidence that its effects are strongly dose-dependent: these issues deserve
consideration in the light of the design of strategies to kill cancer cells via inhibition
of Aurora kinases.

INTRODUCTION

often abnormally expressed in tumor cells and are being
investigated as targets of anti-mitotic compounds for
cancer therapy [9, 10]. Many efforts have converged in the
last years to develop Aurora inhibitors: molecules acting
as ATP-competitors have been identified and some of them
are currently in clinical trials [11]. Only a few of those
molecules discriminate Aurora-A vs Aurora-B and may
thus prove useful both in clinical studies for comparing
the efficacy of anti-tumor responses and for dissecting the
functions of Aurora kinases in mammalian cells.
MLN8237 (Alisertib) is a second generation Aurora
inhibitor currently undergoing Phase-I/III clinical trials
[11-16; www.clinicaltrials.gov]. Thus far, it is one of the
molecules displaying highest specificity for Aurora-A
over Aurora-B (300-fold in in vitro assays and 200-fold
in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells [17]). Most pre-

The Aurora-A kinase is a major regulator of cell
division and operates in distinct processes required for
spindle assembly: in human cells it regulates separation
and maturation of centrosomes at mitotic entry, mitotic
microtubule (MT) nucleation [1- 3] and the integrity of
spindle poles [2, 4, 5]. Recent data also indicate a role
of Aurora-A in central spindle assembly at telophase [6,
7]. The highly homologous Aurora-B kinase also operates
in control of the fidelity of chromosome segregation,
by regulating chromosome condensation, correction of
improper attachments between MTs and kinetochores,
spindle checkpoint function, cytokinesis and abscission
[8].
As other mitotic regulators, Aurora kinases are

clinical studies based on whole cell population analyses
in tumor cell lines showed cell growth inhibition,
accumulation of polyploid cells over time, as well as
induction of cell death [17-19]. Anti-tumor activity was
also demonstrated in xenograft mouse models [17, 20, 21].
Available data on MLN8237-treated cells were
mostly obtained from asynchronous cultures analyzed in
bulk populations. This approach reveals the predominant
cellular behaviour after long exposure to Aurora-A
inhibition (24 to 96 hours) but can miss out transient
phenomena and so mask the unfolding of relevant
processes. In addition, inhibition of as pleiotropic a kinase
as is Aurora-A, yields multiple phenotypes over time,
making it difficult to dissect distinct functional roles
within a bulk population. Microscopy-based single cell
analyses are proving of critical importance to visualize
the array of possible cell responses to anti-mitotic drugs
[22]. Here we have coupled high resolution microscopy
and high-throughput analysis of single cells treated with
increasing doses of Aurora-A inhibitor to investigate the
possible fates of cells with inactive Aurora-A.
A protocol was set up for treating pre-synchronized
cultures when they reach G2 and analyze progression
through G2 and mitosis as soon as Aurora-A inhibition
is achieved. Because MLN8237 induces spindle pole
abnormalities [23], we assessed the occurrence of
chromosome mis-segregation events and aneuploidy
induction, which would represent undesirable effects of
the treatment in anti-cancer therapy. Our results highlight
a partial specificity of MLN8237 in the U2OS cell line,
with multiple cellular responses in a dose-dependent
manner. The single cell analysis enabled us to depict
a fraction of cells with defective spindle orientation,
a defect that was not appreciated in previous studies of
Aurora-A inhibition in human cells. In addition, we find
that low and high MLN8237 concentrations yield mild
and massive aneuploidy, respectively, representing a
tumor-inducing or a tumor-suppressing condition [24].
Collectively, these results draw attention to the variability
and the nature of cellular responses to the loss of Aurora
kinase function, which may represent potential caveats
deserving consideration when designing and interpreting
clinical trials.

suitable for high-resolution single-cell microscopy
analysis, and employed in our previous studies of RNA
interference-mediated Aurora-A inactivation [4, 5, 23].
We set up a protocol by pre-synchronizing U2OS
cells at the G1/S transition by thymidine treatment, then
releasing from arrest into G2 and mitosis (Figure 1A).
MLN8237 was added 6 hours after thymidine release (late
S-phase/early G2) and cells were harvested after further 4
hours. Aurora-A activity was measured at the single cell
level by anti-Aur-A-phospho-Thr288 immunofluorescence
(IF) staining in dose-response assays (Figure 1B, left
panels). Aurora-A auto-phosphorylation was significantly
inhibited at concentrations ranging from 5 nM to 250 nM.
With concentrations higher than 20 nM the residual signal
at spindle poles was below 15% compared to controls. In
Western blot analysis, no phospho-Thr288-Aurora-A was
detectable in mitotic extracts from cultures treated with
20 and 50 nM MLN8237 for 4 hours, while some residual
amount was present after 1 hour (Figure 1C).
Previous reports indicated that MLN8237 above
100 nM also inhibits Aurora-B activity in other cell lines
[19, 25-27]. We therefore assessed the specificity of
MLN8237 by measuring Aurora-B activity using anti-AurB-phospho-Thr232 antibody (Figure 1B, right panels).
Surprisingly, we noticed that Aurora-B activity is already
significantly compromised by 50 nM MLN8237; that was
not evident when using anti-phospho-Histone-H3 (Ser10)
as a reporter of Aurora-B activity (Supplementary Figure
S1), possibly reflecting kinase redundancy or delay in
detecting modulation of phosphorylation of downstream
targets vs auto-phosphorylation.
Our single-cell analysis in U2OS cultures delimits
therefore a narrow MLN8237 concentration window (2050 nM) yielding effective and specific Aurora-A inhibition.

MLN8237 delays mitotic entry and prolongs
mitotic duration in a dose-dependent manner
We investigated the influence of MLN8237 on
mitotic entry: after 4 hours of treatment, we found
a significantly lower percentage of mitotic cells in
MLN8237-treated cultures compared to controls (Figure
2A). This effect is dose-dependent, appearing at ≥ 20 nM,
and is stronger at 250 nM MLN8237. To clarify whether
cells were arrested in the G2 phase or rather delayed in
progression through the G2/M transition, we recorded
cultures in time-lapse experiments from the treatment start
up to 16 hours later (Figure 2B). The peak of interphases
entering mitosis in control cultures (DMSO) was between
4 and 8 hours from the treatment start (Figure 2B) and
was not significantly affected by partial Aurora-A
inhibition (5-10 nM MLN8237). Entry into mitosis was
instead delayed above 20 nM MLN8237. In the 16 hours
of time-lapse recording, 70-80% of the interphase cells
entered mitosis in all treated cultures (about 60% with

250 nM MLN8237): thus, the majority of cells exposed
to MLN8237 are delayed in G2, yet mitotic onset is not
prevented.
Extending the time-lapse recording to 30 hours
indicated that MLN8237 prolonged the duration of mitosis
in a dose-dependent manner (about 300 minutes with 50
nM, compared to about 80 minutes in control cells; Figure
3). Importantly, although slowed down, cells eventually
exited mitosis. Together, the results indicate that both the
G2-to-mitosis transition and the overall duration of the
mitotic process are strongly dependent on Aurora-A.

an accumulation of prometaphase figures over all mitoses
in fixed samples (Supplementary Figure S2). The MT
nucleation defect was strongly dose-dependent and
appeared in a relevant fraction of mitotic cells treated with
50 nM MLN8237 or above.
In cells in which MT nucleation was not visibly
affected, spindles were highly disorganized (affecting 30%
to 60% of all prometaphases with 10 nM or above; Figure
4); a fraction of these prometaphases displayed spindles
with multiple poles, consistent with previous observations
[17, 23]. A non-significant fraction of monopolar spindles
was present at 10-20 nM MLN8237.
The influence of these defects on the global
execution of mitosis was examined in depth in timelapse movies of MLN8237-treated cells. Figure 5, first
row, and Supplementary Movie S1 show examples of
normal mitosis. We observed that a significant fraction
of cells with inhibited Aurora-A (about 20% with 50
nM MLN8237, and a smaller fraction with 250 nM)
underwent multipolar ana-telophase (Figure 5, second
row; Supplementary Movie S2). Multipolar mitoses
took a longer time to reach the stage of chromosome
segregation (about 125 minutes average, compared to 35
minutes in control cells). In some cases two of the multiple
groups of segregating chromosomes eventually re-joined,

We next analyzed spindle structure in cells that
entered mitosis with different degrees of Aurora-A and
Aurora-B inhibition.
With the highest MLN8237 concentration (250
nM) a strong impairment of MT nucleation was evident,
with 70% of prometaphases displaying no MTs (Figure
4); this was associated with a prolonged prometaphase
duration in time-lapse recording experiments, yielding

originating two asymmetric daughter cells (Figure 5, third
row). Lower MLN8237 doses (10-20 nM), which yielded
disorganized spindles in fixed prometaphases (Figure 4),
do not yield multipolar divisions, suggesting that in those
cultures a bipolar or pseudo-bipolar spindle is eventually
assembled before anaphase.
In cultures treated with high MLN8237 doses we
observed prolonged prometaphase (average duration
150-200 minutes) followed by a complete lack of
chromosome segregation and cell division (Figure 5,
fourth row): cells eventually re-adhered to form a single
large or multinucleated interphase, often preceded by
repeated “blebbing” movements (Figure 5, fifth row;
Supplementary Movie S3). The “lack of division”
phenotype appeared in a small fraction of mitoses treated
with 50 nM MLN8237 and became predominant (about
90% of mitoses) with 250 nM. Similar phenotypes were
previously observed in other human cell lines treated
with high MLN8237 concentrations [26, 27]. Since the

activity assays in Figure 1 indicate dual inhibition of both
Aurora-A and -B under high doses, it was important to
establish the contribution of each individual kinase to the
no-division phenotype appearing above 50 nM. Smallscale time-lapse recording of cell cultures subjected to
individual (Aurora-A or Aurora-B) or combined (AuroraA+Aurora-B) RNA interference were set up to clarify
this issue (Supplementary Figure S3): the no-division
phenotype was not recorded in mitoses with selective
inactivation of Aurora-A alone, yet appeared in a small
fraction of Aurora-B defective cells (15,4%) and was
amplified by the concomitant inactivation of both kinases
(41,9%).

In summary, these results show that spindle
organization is the most sensitive process affected
by MLN8237 and is readily altered by even a partial
reduction of Aurora-A activity, associated with unbalanced
chromosome segregation. Stronger inhibition of the kinase
induces impairment in MT nucleation, associated with
prolonged prometaphase duration. The highest MLN8237
dose leads to a complete failure of cell division, largely
ascribable to the concomitant inhibition of Aurora-B.

from mitotic round-up (on average 65 minutes with
5-10 nM and 110 with 20 nM MLN8237) compared to
control cells (35 minutes). The time from the onset of
chromosome segregation to re-formation of daughter
interphase cells was instead unaltered, indicating that
the process of chromosome segregation per se was not
disrupted. However, we often recorded a delay between
re-adhesion of the lower and the upper cell (see the
example in Figure 6A and Supplementary Movie S4).
No significant induction of mis-oriented division was
observed above 50 nM MLN8237 (Figure 6B). In the case

of 250 nM MLN8237 treatment, this is consistent with the
predominance of the no-division phenotype (see Figure 5).
The absence of mis-oriented divisions with 50 nM, which
induced highly disorganized spindles and/or defective MT
nucleation (see Figure 4), suggests that MTs are required

and that spindle mis-orientation drives the abnormally
oriented divisions.
To gain better resolution we used an U2OS cell
line derivative stably expressing fluorescently labelled
alpha-tubulin and histone H2B in video recoding assays
(Supplementary Figure S4). MLN8237-treated mitoses
that did not divide parallel to the culture dish displayed
spindle rotation during prometaphase, such that often
only one of the two poles was visible (Figure 6A,
lower panels). To define the spindle orientation axis, we
analyzed fixed samples and measured the angle formed
between the centrosome-centrosome axis and the growing
surface (Figure 6C). This analysis was performed in

prometaphases from cultures treated with 5, 10 or 20 nM
MLN8237 compared to controls. The average angle in
control prometaphases was 11° and almost doubled (19°,
mean value) in MLN8237-treated cells (p<0,01), reaching
a >30° distortion in about 20% of prometaphases. Thus,
the inhibition of Aurora-A under conditions that do not
impair spindle formation altogether influences the proper
orientation of the spindle axis and hence of cell division.

(Figure 7). Cells were stained with combinations of DAPI
and antibodies against alpha-tubulin and pericentrin
(examples in Figure 7B, upper panels) or lamin-B1 and
alpha- or gamma-tubulin (middle and lower panels)
and categorized: cells with loss or gain of 1 or few
chromosomes (1-2 micronuclei), polyploid (1 large
nucleus with 4 pericentrin or gamma-tubulin signals),
binucleated, or multinucleated.
Indeed, following treatment with 250 nM
MLN8237, most interphases appeared to have undergone
chromosome mis-segregation (>65% multinucleated
cells); a smaller fraction (about 10%) became polyploid.
Only less than 10% of interphases were apparently normal
(Figure 7C). Abnormalities were also observed in cells
generated during treatment with 50 nM MLN8237: some
20% were multinucleated or polyploid and about 15%
were binucleated. Interestingly, in about one third of the
binucleated cells the nuclei were not equivalent in size,
suggesting that they represent aberrant products of the
multipolar/asymmetric divisions (see Figure 5). Timelapse imaging of fluorescently labelled U2OS cells showed
that some interphases remained very close after division
with a connecting alpha-tubulin bridge (Supplementary
Figure S4), possibly representing intermediate figures
before binucleation.
20 nM and 50 nM MLN8237 also yielded a
significant induction (14-15%) of cells with micronuclei,
indicative of mild aneuploidy (Figure 7C). To assess
whether micronuclei reflected genuine chromosome
loss events, and hence aneuploidy, we assessed whether
they contained whole chromosomes by staining with
CREST antibodies to human centromeres (Figure 8A).
We observed a 6- and 17-fold increase of CREST-positive
micronuclei in 20 and 50 nM MLN8237-treated cultures,
respectively, compared to controls. Consistent with this,
recording of GFP-labelled chromosomes dynamically
visualized chromosome bridges and micronuclei
formation; interestingly, these defects were always present
in mitoses with multipolar spindles (Supplementary Figure
S4).
These results indicate different extents of ploidy
alterations in MLN8237-treated cultures, which we
decided to investigate directly by employing FISH
(Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) analysis. We counted
hybridization signals produced by chromosome-specific
centromeric probes (chromosome 7 and 11) in interphases
originated from MLN8237-treated mitoses (protocol in
Figure 7). Most (about 85%) control interphases displayed
3-4 signals for both chromosome 7 and 11 (Figure 8B),
confirming that U2OS cells are hypertriploid. 20 nM
MLN8237 induced a slight shift in the frequency of cells
with fewer signals (2-fold increase in interphases with 1-2
signals compared to controls), likely corresponding to the
chromosome loss events evidenced by the micronuclei
analysis. With 50 nM MLN8237, cells displaying 3-4
signals decreased to about 70% and cells with > 4 signals

Induction of aneuploidy in the progeny of
MLN8237-treated mitoses
Some of the defects observed in MLN8237-treated
mitoses suggest the possibility that genetically imbalanced
daughter cells are generated.
To address this issue we treated pre-synchronized
cells with MLN8237 in G2 as described, fixed the cells
after 24 hours and screened defects in interphase cells
presumably representing the progeny of treated mitoses

correspondingly increased; a minor fraction of truly
polyploid cells (≥6 signals for both chromosomes within
a single large nuclei) was also identified, consistent with
the IF results in Figure 7. With 250 nM MLN8237 > 50%
interphases had ≥ 6 signals, indicative of gain of complete
sets of chromosomes, consistent with the lack of division
observed in time-lapse experiments (Figure 5) and with
the frequent multinucleated state depicted in Figure 7.
FACS analysis confirmed the increase in ploidy in about
45% of the viable population (data not shown) after 48 and
96 hours of treatment with 250 nM MLN8237.
Together these analyses indicate that MLN8237
treatment yields variable levels of aneuploidy in daughter
cells, in a dose-dependent manner.

duration) or from the generation of abnormal interphase
cells. The kinetics of appearance of mitotic cells depicted
two waves of division in control cultures (Figure 9C). In
MLN8237-treated cultures the first mitotic peaks were
shifted in time and appeared broader. Both effects were
dose-dependent, consistent with our data on mitotic entry
and duration (Figures 2 and 3). At 250 nM inhibitor, no
second wave of division was observed. Concomitantly,
we observed a strong increase of multinucleated cells at
250 nM and a milder effect at 50 nM MLN8237. Some
polyploid cells appeared under these conditions (below
3%). Detection of multinucleated and polyploid cells was
therefore consistent with the results from fixed samples
(Figures 7 and 8). Importantly, the induction of cell death
remained below 3% throughout the recording time (Figure
9C, bottom right panel), and remained at a similar level
in one time-lapse experiment extended to 65 hours (not
shown).
Together, the high-throughput data indicate that
MLN8237 induces a dose-dependent lengthening of
mitotic progression and the generation of abnormal
daughter cells that are impaired in re-dividing, with a
cytostatic effect, while low cytotoxicity is observed within
the first 48 hours of treatment.
We also performed proliferation/cell death analyses

Long term fate of MLN8237-treated cells
The time-lapse analysis thus far indicates that
MLN8237 (5-250 nM range) induces no significant cell
death in U2OS mitotic cells. We investigated the longterm outcome of the treatment in high-throughput timelapse analyses for a length of time (48 hours) roughly
corresponding to 2 division cycles. Using the fluorescently
labelled U2OS cell line, we analyzed the data with an
automated method, the CellCognition software [28],
trained to classify cells as interphasic, mitotic,
dead, multinucleated or polyploid (examples
in Figure 9A). In the 48 hours of the recording
time, the cell number increased threefold in
control cultures, yet dose-dependent growth
inhibition was observed in cultures treated
with MLN8237, with almost no increase with
250 nM MLN8237 (Figure 9B, left panel).
Consistent with this, the number of normal
interphase cells was dramatically reduced by
the treatment (Figure 9B, right panel): this
effect could result either from an increase
in mitotic cells (due to prolonged mitotic

after several days (Figure 10) by cell counting and FACS
measurement of the DNA content. After 48 hours of
treatment, corresponding to the end of the high-throughput
video-recording, a slight decrease in the total cell number
was observed with 5-10-20 nM MLN8237 compared to
control cultures (Figure 10A); the overall proliferation
trend remained comparable to controls over 96 hours.
Cell growth inhibition was instead appreciated with 50
nM MLN8237 and even more effectively with 250 nM
MLN8237 (Figure 10A).
To assess cell death we measured cells with a
sub-G1 DNA content by FACS analysis (Figure 10B). That
revealed a generally higher level of cell death compared
to the microscopy analysis, possibly reflecting technical
specificities in the methodology: indeed, detached
dead cells are counted by cytofluorimetry, while being
preferentially lost in microscopy analysis. Nevertheless,
by FACS analysis, only 250 nM MLN8237 induced
remarkable cell death (about 30% of sub-G1 cells after 48
hours of treatment, increasing to about 50% after 96 hours,
compared to about 10% in control cultures; Figure 10B).
Thus, MLN8237 treatment in concentrations that

genuinely inhibit Aurora-A does not efficiently promote
cell death in U2OS cells; a toxic effects is only observed
after very long exposure times to high doses that
simultaneously target Aurora-B.

DISCUSSION
Here we have used the MLN8237 small molecule
inhibitor to investigate mitotic roles of the Aurora-A
kinase in osteosarcoma U2OS cells; this molecule is
under clinical trial in several cancer types including
osteosarcoma.
We first determined the extent and specificity of
kinase inhibition by assessing Aurora-A and Aurora-B
self-phosphorylation. MLN8237 was effective over
Aurora-A in the 20-50 nM range, but also inhibited
Aurora-B above 50 nM. The loss of selectivity with high
doses was previously reported [25-27]. The inhibition of
Aurora-B identified here with 50 nM MLN8237 (a very
close condition to that required for complete Aurora-A
inhibition) was instead not noticed before using histone H3
phosphorylation as a reporter, indicating that the selection
of activity reporters is critical to ascertain the selectivity
of kinase inhibitors. It also evidences that the window
at which MLN8237 fully inhibits Aurora-A, without
concomitantly affecting Aurora-B, can be very narrow
in some cell lines, indicating that selective inhibition of
Aurora-A vs Aurora-B remains a critical issue, even with
the best performing ATP-competitors.
MLN8237 treatment prolongs the G2 phase
duration. The G2 delay was under-appreciated in previous
studies using MLN8237 in asynchronous cultures, yet
was observed when Aurora-A was inhibited by either
antibody microinjection or RNA interference [1, 29], or
by conditional ablation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs; [30]). No permanent arrest is however induced,
suggesting that Aurora-A functions in G2 are important,
but can be taken over by other kinases. Indeed, the
G2 delay is more severe with 250 nM, under which
condition Aurora-B is also inhibited. These findings raise
the possibility that centrosome- and/or MT-associated
defects induced by Aurora-A inactivation in G2 evoke
a checkpoint response that delays the transition towards
mitosis onset.
Dose-response analyses of MLN8237-treated
cells that entered mitosis revealed processes that are
differentially sensitive to Aurora-A inactivation, as
depicted in the schematics in Figure 11. Complete
Aurora-A inhibition impaired MT nucleation; consistent
with this, previous data showed that partial vs complete
RNA interference-mediated depletion of Aurora-A
differentially affects maturation of centrosomes, required
for mitotic MT nucleation [1, 2]. Partial Aurora-A
inhibition (10 nM MLN8237) instead yielded multipolar
or disorganized spindles, the frequency of which
increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 50 nM.

Defective spindle assembly was associated with longer
prometaphase duration compared to untreated cells. The
highest frequency of induction of spindle organization
defects (50 nM) was associated with multipolar divisions.
250 nM MLN8237 also prolonged prometaphase
duration, after which cells re-adhered and eventually
exited mitosis without division. The failure of
chromosome segregation could be appreciated in timelapse experiments and was consistent with previous results
obtained from concomitant inactivation of Aurora-A and
B kinases by high MLN8237 doses in Hep3B or HeLa
cells or, to a lesser extent, following Aurora-B inhibition
in HeLa cells [26, 27]. Our own recording experiments of
interfered mitoses for Aurora-A, or -B, or both, confirm a
mild effect of Aurora-B inactivation alone and a synergic
effect of the inactivation of both kinases. Complementary
functions of Aurora-A and B in chromosome segregation
also emerged in chicken DT40 Aurora-AKO cells treated
with an Aurora-B specific inhibitor [31]. None of the
approaches used to inactivate Aurora-A alone in human
cultured cells yielded chromosome segregation failure [2,
27, 32]. The latter was instead described in Aurora-A-null
MEFs [30, 33], suggesting specific modes of action of the
two kinases in this cellular context, which may reflect a
different stoichiometry between Aurora-A and B and/or
their substrates.
An interesting finding from this study is the
induction of mis-oriented divisions by low MLN8237
concentrations (5-20 nM); the inhibitor is selective for
Aurora-A at these doses and, as recalled above, does
not impair MT nucleation: this directly implicates the
lack of Aurora-A in the mis-orientation phenotype and
suggests that MTs are required. Interestingly, Aurora-A

is implicated in spindle orientation in asymmetric
cell divisions in Drosophila [34] via phosphorylation
of Pins [35]. Excess Aurora-A can also influence the
spindle orientation and the cell fate in human mammary
epithelium stem/progenitor cells [36]. In our time-lapse
assays using a U2OS cell line with fluorescent MTs, we
actually visualized spindle rotation movements: thus,
Aurora-A activity is required for pathways that determine
the mitotic spindle orientation, raising the possibility that
Aurora-A inhibition influences the fate of asymmetrically
dividing cells and/or tissue architecture.
Time-lapse experiments also revealed that
MLN8237 generates chromosome mis-segregation. At
high concentrations, when both Aurora-A and Aurora-B
are inhibited, massive aneuploidy is observed, with
the generation of multinucleated daughter cells. Lower
doses that inhibit Aurora-A alone yield mild aneuploidy,
with increased number of CREST-positive micronuclei
(schematics in Figure 11). FISH analysis depicted the
differential generation of mild and massive aneuploidy
by low and high MLN8237 doses, respectively. This is
relevant, given the pro- or anti-tumorigenic effects of
aneuploidy depending on the extent of chromosome missegregation [24]. Consistent with our observations, Yang
and colleagues [37] described the generation of an 8N
population following simultaneous RNA interferencemediated inactivation of Aurora-A and Aurora-B, but not
of Aurora-A alone, in U2OS cells. Segregation defects
(lagging chromosomes and chromatin bridges) were
observed in Aurora-A-null MEFs, with increased ploidy
over time [30, 33], again evidencing a crucial contribution
of Aurora-A to chromosome segregation in this system.
We also observed binucleated cells in the progeny
of MLN8237-treated mitoses; in time-lapse analyses,
telophase cells often remained in closer proximity to
one another compared to controls, and tubulin bridges
persisted, a phenotype that may possibly evolve into a
binucleated cell. The observation of binucleated cells
with 20 nM MLN8237 would support a recently proposed
direct role of Aurora-A in late steps of cell division [6, 7].
Importantly, MLN8237 failed to induce cell death
in mitosis nor did it cause a highly effective elimination
of the cellular offspring within the first 48 hours of
treatment. Recent time-lapse studies with MLN8237
reported variable results regarding mitotic cell death:
no mitotic toxicity was observed in Hep3B cells [26],
whereas some death from mitosis was recorded in HeLa
cells [27]. Aurora-A inactivation therefore appears to
require a set of concomitant conditions, as yet elusive,
for mitotic cell death activation. The highly aneuploid
progeny generated in our assays at 50 nM (and, to a higher
extent, 250 nM) MLN8237 originates cells impaired in
further cell division, hence unviable in the long term. The
mechanisms underlying the cytostatic effects of Aurora-A
inactivation are controversial: a dose- and time-dependent
induction of apoptosis was described in different cell

lines treated with MLN8237 [18, 19, 38, 39], while in
other cases the MLN8237-induced cytostatic effect is
attributed to senescence [40] consistent with results
described in Aurora-A-null MEFs [33], or to induction
of differentiation pathways [41]. These observations
suggest that both the treatment parameters and the
cellular background contribute to determine the long-term
outcome of MLN8237-treated cultures.
In conclusion, the broad variability in the U2OS
cell response to MLN8237 highlighted in this study is an
important issue in the light of the use of this compound
in anti-cancer therapy. In the human organism undergoing
treatment, the compound dose cannot be constant and is
expected to rise and fall over time. It will be important
to extend these studies and shed light on the pathways
driving the response towards one or another cell fate, with
the perspective to modulate such choice and drive cells
towards death pathways.

IF
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed as follows:
(a) –20°C methanol, 6 minutes; or, for phosphoAurora-B (Thr232) staining, (b) 3.7% PFA in PBS, 10
minutes at room temperature followed by 5 minutes in
0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS. Blocking and all antibody
incubations were performed at room temperature in
PBS/0.05% Tween 20/3% BSA. Cells were counterstained
with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 µg/ml) and
mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Primary
antibodies were: mouse anti-alpha-tubulin (1:2000, B-5-12, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-Aurora-A (0.5 µg/ml, BD
Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-phospho-Aurora-A
(Thr288) (1:250, C39D8; Cell Signaling Technology),
rabbit anti-pericentrin (2 µg/ml, ab4448; Abcam), rabbit
anti-phospho-Aurora-B (Thr232) (1:50, Poly6361,
BioLegend), mouse anti-phospho-Histone-H3 (Ser 10)
(0.25 µg/ml, clone 3H10, Millipore), mouse anti-γ-tubulin
(1:1000, GTU-88, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-lamin B1
(1 µg/ml, ab16048; Abcam), human anti-centromere
(CREST; 1:20, Antibodies Incorporated). Samples were
analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope equipped
with a Qicam Fast 1394 CCD camera (QImaging). Image
acquisition, deconvolution and Extended Depth of Focus
on Z-serial optical sections were performed using NisElements AR 4.2 (Nikon); images were further processed
with Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0.

METHODS
Cell cultures, synchronization protocols and
treatments
The human U2OS osteosarcoma cell line (ATCC:
HTB-96) was grown at 370C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in
DMEM, supplemented with 10% faetal bovine serum.
U2OS cells stably expressing H2B-GFP and RFP-alphatubulin (kind gift of L. Lanzetti, Institute for Cancer
Research at Candiolo, Italy) were cultured under the same
conditions and used in time-lapse imaging experiments.
For synchronization, cells were subjected to a 24 hours
block in 2 mM thymidine. Cultures were then released
from the G1/S arrest by washing away the thymidine and
adding fresh medium containing 30 µM deoxycytidine; 6
hours post-release cultures were treated with MLN8237
(5-250 nM as indicated; Selleck Chemicals) or 0.1 µg/ml
nocodazole (Sigma Aldrich). Mock-treated cultures were
incubated with DMSO.

Quantitative analysis of IF signals.
Signals were measured using Nis Elements AR
4.2 (nd2 file format). Analysis of endogenous Aurora-A
and Aurora-B activity in mitotic cells was performed
as follows: a) p-Thr288-Aurora-A staining: average
pixel intensity at spindle poles, corrected for external
background; b) p-Thr232-Aurora-B staining: sum intensity
at chromosomes, corrected for external background.
Images for quantification of mitotic signals were
Maximum Intensity Projections from z-stacks (0.6 µm,
ranging over a 5-10 µm). Box-plots were generated using
the web-tool BoxPlotR.
For measuring the angle between the centrosomecentrosome axis and the culture surface z-stacks serial
images were used. The “arctan(xy/z)” formula for
calculating the angle of a right triangle was applied with
“xy” being the distance between centrosomes in xy in the
maximum intensity projection, and “z” being the distance

Cell counting and FACS analysis
Cells were harvested after 48 and 96 hours from
treatment. One sample was harvested when cultures were
released in thymidine–free medium (t=0h) as reference for
the initial number of cells and for verifying the efficacy of
the thymidine arrest. For counting the number of cells a
Z1 Coulter Particle Counter (Beckman Coulter) was used.
For FACS analysis samples were permeabilized with
0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS. Cell cycle phase distribution
was analyzed after incubation with propidium iodide (PI,
Sigma P4170, 0.04 mg/ml) using a flow cytofluorimeter
Epics XL apparatus (Beckman Coulter). Parameters SS
and FL-3 were acquired in a linear amplification scale,

is shown in Figure 6C. Values were statistically analyzed
using the InStat3 software, using either (i) the unpaired

distribution.

conditions, time-lapse acquisition, starting 6 hours after
the treatment, was extended for 8 hours only to avoid
phototoxic effects.
For high-throughput experiments, cells were seeded
in 96-well plates. Images were acquired with a ScanR
microscope (Olympus) using a 10x objective, an Olympus
DBH1 camera and the ScanR acquisition software.
Temperature and CO2 were kept constant by an incubation
system on the microscope. Acquisition was performed
every 30 minutes using Phase contrast and fluorescence
imaging, for a total duration of 48-65 hours.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
Cells grown on coverslips were fixed at room
temperature with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid, air dried and
stored at −20°C for at least one day. Before hybridization,
coverslips were again incubated in 3:1 methanol:acetic
acid, 1 hour at room temperature, then heated 2 hours
at 650C and dehydrated in 70%-90%-100% cold
ethanol. Denaturation of probes in the hybridization mix
(Fluorescein-labeled Chromosome 7 Satellite Probe,
cat: PSAT0007-G; rhodamine-labeled Chromosome 11
Satellite Probe, cat: PSAT001-R; Hybridization Buffer
QB007, all from Q-BIOgene) was performed at 960C for
10 minutes. When the mix was applied on coverslips a
co-denaturation step was performed (2 minutes, 72 °C),
followed by the hybridization incubation, performed at
370C, overnight. Coverslips were then washed in SSC, at
370C and 600C, and counterstained with DAPI (0.2 µg/
ml) in SSC, 10 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips
were mounted with Vectashield and analyzed with a Nikon
Eclipse 90i microscope, using a 20x objective (Plan Fluor,
0.5 N.A.). Signals per nucleus were counted using the
Object count function of Nis Elements AR 4.2 (nd2 file
format), setting the parameters using the Spot detection
function.

Automated analysis of high-throughput data
Data from high-throughput experiments were
analyzed by the CellCognition software (v 1.3.3-28,
[28]). The software was used to segment the cells, extract
features and classify them using a support vector machine.
The classes defined were: interphases, prometaphases,
metaphases, ana-telophases, multinucleated interphases,
poliployd cells, dead cells; an additional class of debris or
of cells with non homogeneous morphology which could
not be included in any of the other categories was created
and was then excluded from subsequent data elaboration to
avoid artifacts. The classifier was trained with images from
independent experiments with a training set comprising a
minimum of 100 cells per class (with the exception of the
polyploid class, of which only 33 examples were found).
A confusion matrix and a classification test were used to
assess the quality of classification before the analysis. The
output data were further analyzed using Microsoft Excel;
a single class for Mitoses was generated by pooling the
prometaphase, metaphase and ana-telophase classes.
Values for each well were pooled from 6 imaging fields;
average values from 4 replicates within one experiment
are shown in Figure 9. A similar trend was observed in 2
independent experiments (6 additional replicates).

Time-lapse recording
Cells seeded in 35 mm dishes (ibiTreat, cod. 81156,
or glass bottom, cod. 81158, both from Ibidi) or 8-well
micro-slides (ibiTreat, cod. 80826, Ibidi) were observed
under an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon), using
60x [Plan Apo, 1.4 N.A. Differential Interference Contrast
(DIC), oil immersion] or 40x (Plan Fluor, 0.60 N.A. DIC)
objectives (Nikon); during the whole observation cells
were kept in a microscope stage incubator (Basic WJ,
Okolab), at 37°C and 5% CO2. DIC images were acquired
every 5 minutes over 24 hours using a DS-Qi1Mc camera
and the NIS-Elements AR 3.22 software (Nikon). Image
and movie processing were performed with NIS-Elements
AR 4.2.
Imaging of the U2OS cell line stably expressing
H2B-GFP and RFP-alpha-tubulin was performed with the
60x objective: images were acquired every 7 minutes in
the 3 channels. z-stacks of the fluorescent channels were
acquired every 1 µm over a range of 8 µm, attenuating
the fluorescence lamp intensity to 1/32. Under these

Mitotic cells collected by shake off were lysed in
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl,
1% NP40, 1 mM EGTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.
Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10%
Laemmli gel and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane
(Protran BA83, Whatman) using a semi-dry system (BIORAD). 40 µg of extract per lane were loaded. Blocking
and antibody incubations were performed at room
temperature in PBS/0.1% Tween 20/5% low fat milk,
or in PBS/0.1% Tween 20/5% BSA (for anti-phosphoAurora-A hybridization). Antibodies were: mouse antiAurora-A (1 µg/ml; BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit
anti-phospho-Aurora-A (Thr288) (1:1000; C39D8; Cell
Signaling Technology), goat anti-actin (0.5 µg/ml, I-19;
