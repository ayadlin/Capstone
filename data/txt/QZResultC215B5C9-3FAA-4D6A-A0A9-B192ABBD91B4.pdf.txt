Abstract
c-Myc is a highly unstable transcription factor whose
deregulation and increased expression are associated with
cancer. Degrasyn, a small synthetic molecule, induces rapid
degradation of c-Myc protein in MM-1 multiple myeloma and
other tumor cell lines. Destruction of c-Myc by degrasyn
requires the presence of a region of c-Myc between amino acid
residues 316 and 378 that has not previously been associated
with c-Myc stability. Degrasyn-induced degradation of c-Myc
depends on proteasomes but is independent of the degron
regions previously shown to be important for ubiquitinmediated targeting and proteasomal destruction of the
protein. Degrasyn-dependent c-Myc proteolysis is not mediated by any previously identified c-Myc regulatory mechanism,
does not require new protein synthesis, and does not depend
on the nuclear localization of c-Myc. Degrasyn reduced c-Myc
levels in A375 melanoma cells and in A375 tumors in nude
mice, and this activity correlated with tumor growth inhibition. Together, these results suggest that degrasyn reduces the
stability of c-Myc in vitro and in vivo through a unique
signaling process that uses c-Myc domains not previously
associated with c-Myc regulation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3912–8]

Introduction
c-Myc is a central regulator of key cellular processes including
differentiation, G1-S phase transition, proliferation, maintenance of
cell size, redox state, genomic integrity, and apoptosis (1–3). Current
estimates suggest that c-Myc influences 5% to 15% of the human
genome (4) and is finely regulated owing to its central role in cell
regulation (5, 6). Loss of control of c-Myc expression and stability
occurs in many human cancers (7, 8) and is associated with highly
aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors with poor patient prognosis. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (9), a specific multistep process
that results in the target protein being rapidly destroyed by the 20S
proteasome, plays an important role in c-Myc degradation and is
responsible for its short half-life (10–16).
c-Myc protein levels are regulated by a NH2-terminal ‘‘degron’’
that signals c-Myc ubiquitination and a COOH-terminal ‘‘stabilon’’
that stabilizes c-Myc by enabling it to associate with the POZ
domain protein Miz or to be sequestered into a stabilizing
subnuclear compartment (12, 17). The degron, located within the
first 147 residues of the protein, spans the transactivation domain

and includes two highly conserved sequences known as myc box I
(MB I) and myc box II (MB II; refs. 12, 13). Located within MB I are
two key amino acid residues (Thr58 and Ser62) whose pattern of
phosphorylation determines c-Myc stability. c-MycS, a naturally
occurring mutant of c-Myc, has a half-life similar to that of the fulllength c-Myc despite missing the first 100 amino acids (18),
suggesting that regions of c-Myc outside the degron are also
important in its regulation. The D element (amino acids 190–210),
which overlaps MB II, and the adjacent PEST sequence (amino
acids 226–270) are necessary for rapid c-Myc proteolysis at a step
after ubiquitination (19, 20). A second F-box protein (Skp2) along
with its associated E3 ligase SCF complex (Skp/Cul1/F-box)
interact with c-Myc and mediate the destabilization of the protein
(21, 22). Skp2-binding sites have been identified between residues
129 to 147 and 379 to 418 of c-Myc. Under normal growth
conditions, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) associates with c-Myc
in a region between amino acids 127 and 189 and mediates its
ubiquitination and degradation (14). The Cdc42/Rac GTPasecontrolled kinase PAK2 phosphorylates c-Myc at Thr358, Ser373, and
Thr400, reducing its interaction with Max and preventing c-Myc–
mediated transcription while increasing its degradation through a
process that remains elusive (23, 24).
The synthetic small molecule degrasyn induces rapid downregulation of c-Myc in several tumor cell types, including MM-1
multiple myeloma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and A375 melanoma.
Degrasyn was derived from a small chemical library screened for its
ability to inhibit cytokine-stimulated signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (Stat3) activation in a cell-based assay. On the
basis of previous reports of a link between Jak/Stat inhibition and
suppression of c-Myc (25, 26), additional compounds were synthesized
and screened for their ability to directly reduce c-Myc levels in the
absence of Stat3 activation. After extensive structure-activity studies,
degrasyn emerged as a potent and rapid regulator of c-Myc protein
levels in multiple tumors. The NH2-terminal degron of c-Myc has been
shown to be important for proteasomal-dependent degradation of
c-Myc. However, there is little evidence that the central region of c-Myc
serves as a major target recognition site for proteasomal-dependent
degradation of c-Myc that is independent of the degron. In this study,
we show that degrasyn induces the proteasomal-dependent degradation of c-Myc by targeting a region within amino acid residues 316 to
335 and 356 to 378, neither of which had previously been shown
important for c-Myc degradation. This mechanism is unique, as it is
not inhibited by deletion of c-Myc domains essential for ubiquitinmediated degradation. These observations suggest that degrasyn
induces degradation of c-Myc through a novel signaling mechanism
that uses unique regions of c-Myc for activity.

MD) and antibodies to c-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA),
actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and hemagglutinin (HA; Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN). Degrasyn (Fig. 1A) was synthesized and purified
at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Canter.
Cell lines. MM-1 multiple myeloma cells were kindly provided by
Dr. Steven Rosen (Northwestern University). A375 melanoma cells were
obtained from Dr. Elizabeth Grimm (Department of Experimental
Therapeutics, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). HeLa cervical carcinoma
cells were provided by Dr. Mein-Chie Hung (Department of Molecular
Oncology, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). All cell lines were grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Transfection. HeLa cells (5  104) were transfected with 0.5 to 2 Ag of
HA-tagged wild-type c-Myc cDNA or cDNA of c-Myc deletion mutants
(kindly provided by Dr. William P. Tansey, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)
via the lipid delivery system SN2 (kindly provided by Dr. Mein-Chie Hung),
and the transfected cells were treated 24 h later with buffer or with 5 Amol/L
degrasyn for 2 h.
Immunoblotting. Protein extracts from cell lysates were separated by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and
blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% dry milk/TBS/0.1% Tween.
Incubation with primary antibody (diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin/
TBS/0.1% Tween) overnight at 4jC was followed by a 1-h incubation with
horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted in 5% dry milk/TBS/0.1%
Tween. Membranes were then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Plasmid DNA manipulations. The mammalian expression vector for
HA epitope-tagged c-Myc was obtained by cloning the wild-type c-Myc
coding sequence into pCGN (kindly provided by Dr. William P. Tansey). Myc
mutants deleted at amino acids 316 to 336, 337 to 357, 358 to 378 or with
point mutations Thr358 and Ser373 to alanine were created in the c-Myc-wt
HA-tagged template by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Antitumor activity in nude mice. All animal experiments were done
under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Six- to 7-week-old female
Swiss nude mice were purchased from the breeding facility of the
Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology at the M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Ten to 12 animals were inoculated s.c. with 4  106 A375
melanoma cells (0.2 mL), and after measurable tumor was detected, animals
were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated with 40 mg/
kg degrasyn injected i.p. in a 0.1-mL suspension of DMSO/PEG300 (1:1), and
the other group was given DMSO/PEG300 alone every other day. Animals
were treated and weighed, and tumor volumes were measured every other
day until tumor volumes approached 1.5 cm3. Tumor dimensions were
measured with calipers, and volumes were calculated with the formula:
L (length)  W (width)  2H (height). Data are reported as the mean F

SEM of measurements made on five or six animals. Statistical significance
was calculated with the Student’s t test.
Two hours after the final injection, A375 tumors were extracted from
control and degrasyn-treated animals, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
homogenized in lysis buffer (at 10 mg/mL final protein concentration).
Forty-microgram portions of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted for c-Myc and actin (as a protein loading control).

Results
Degrasyn causes the rapid down-regulation of c-Myc in the
MM-1 multiple myeloma cell line. MM-1 cells express high and
stable levels of c-Myc (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Sequence analysis of the cMyc gene in these cells revealed no mutations within the gene that
could account for the increased protein stability (data not shown).
When MM-1 cells were incubated in the presence of the protein
synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, c-Myc was down-regulated at a
rate similar to that described in the literature (12, 14, 27), with an
estimated half-life of 20 to 30 min (Fig. 1B). These results suggest
that the stability of c-Myc in MM-1 cells results from its rate of
synthesis outpacing its rate of degradation. In the absence of
cycloheximide, incubation of MM-1 cells with 5 Amol/L degrasyn
resulted in the rapid (f90% loss within 5 min) and complete (100%
by 30 min) down-regulation of c-Myc protein (Fig. 1C). Reduction
in c-Myc levels was both time and degrasyn concentration
dependent (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that degrasyn activates
a pathway that results in rapid down-regulation of c-Myc.
Degrasyn reduces c-Myc protein levels through a proteosome-dependent process. The expression of c-Myc is tightly
regulated at many levels, including transcriptional (5), translational, and posttranslational (6). To determine whether degrasyn effects
c-Myc gene expression and stability, Northern blots were done
on RNA derived from control and degrasyn-treated MM-1 cells
(Fig. 2A). In these experiments, MM-1 cells were incubated with
degrasyn for the specified intervals followed by extraction of total
RNA (with the Qiagen RNeasy kit, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol) and Northern blotting with c-Myc primers previously
described by other investigators (28). 28S RNA was used as an RNA
loading control. Degrasyn reduced c-Myc protein levels but did not
affect c-Myc mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Similar results were
obtained when c-Myc mRNA expression levels were analyzed by
real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). We conclude that
degrasyn reduces c-Myc protein levels without affecting c-Myc
gene expression or stability.

Figure 2. Degrasyn reduces c-Myc protein levels through a proteosomedependent process. A, MM-1 cells were treated as indicated before extraction
of total RNA. RNA was resolved by agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a
membrane, and hybridized with a c-Myc probe to determine the level of c-Myc
RNA in each sample. 28S RNA (ethidium bromide staining) was used as a
measure of RNA content in each lane. B, MM-1 cells were left untreated (lane 1)
or treated with DMSO (lane 2), 5 Amol/L degrasyn (lane 3), 5 Amol/L degrasyn
plus 100 Amol/L LLnL (lane 4), 5 Amol/L degrasyn plus 100 Amol/L LLnM
(lane 5), 5 Amol/L degrasyn plus 100 Amol/L E-64d (lane 6 ), 5 Amol/L degrasyn
plus 40 Amol/L MG132 (lane 7), 5 Amol/L degrasyn plus 40 Amol/L PS341
(lane 8), 5 Amol/L degrasyn plus 100 Amol/L chloroquine (lane 9), 5 Amol/L
degrasyn plus 2,500 Amol/L ammonium chloride (lane 10; amm. chlor. ),
or 5 Amol/L degrasyn plus 50 Ag/mL cycloheximide (lane 11). All inhibitors
were added 2 h before the addition of degrasyn. Cell lysates were analyzed
for c-Myc and Max expression by Western blotting. Actin was used as the protein
loading control.

Rapid c-Myc down-regulation may involve activation or
facilitation of proteolysis. To determine whether proteases were
associated with degrasyn-induced regulation of c-Myc, we examined the effect of several protease inhibitors (12, 29) on degrasyninduced c-Myc degradation in MM-1 cells (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of
MM-1 cells with LLnL, MG-132, or PS341 before incubation with
degrasyn strongly reduced c-Myc down-regulation compared with
that in cells treated with buffer only. A weaker reduction of c-Myc
was observed in cells pretreated with the calpain inhibitor LLnM,
which may be due to its previously described weak proteosomal
inhibitory activity (30). This effect is minor when compared with
that of cells pretreated with more potent and selective proteosomal
inhibitors (LLnL, MG-132, and PS341). No change in c-Myc downregulation was noted in cells pretreated with the lysosomal
protease inhibitor E-64d, chloroquine, or ammonium chloride.
c-Myc depletion by degrasyn was not affected by pretreatment with
cycloheximide, suggesting that degrasyn does not require new
protein synthesis to induce c-Myc down-regulation. These experiments suggest that specific proteases play a role in the degrasyninduced depletion of c-Myc (12). Degrasyn also shows c-Myc target
selectivity, as the c-Myc complexing protein Max was not affected
by degrasyn (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that degrasyn induces
the down-regulation of c-Myc protein through activation of a
protease or a proteosomal-dependent pathway.
Deletion of amino acids 316 to 378 on c-Myc reduces its
destabilization and destruction by degrasyn. c-Myc instability is

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

due primarily to its rapid destruction by ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis (13, 16, 19, 31, 32). The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway
involves a specific multistep process that results in proteins being
targeted for polyubiquitination and destroyed by the 20S
proteasome (9, 33). Many regions of c-Myc have been shown to
participate in its stability and proteasomal regulation. The degron
situated within the first 147 amino acid residues of the protein has
an important signaling role in its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation. However, regions of c-Myc outside the degron have
also been shown to regulate its stability. To determine if degrasyn
activates known regulators of c-Myc stability or induces c-Myc
degradation by activating a novel signaling pathway, we used a
liposomal delivery system to transiently express either wild-type
c-Myc (Fig. 3A) or a panel of scanning deletion mutants (DA-DG)
generated by the deletion of f60-amino-acid segments from c-Myc
(ref. 20; Fig. 3B) in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were used because of
their endogenous sensitivity to degrasyn-mediated c-Myc downregulation and their ability to overexpress c-Myc and its deletion
mutants after liposomal transfection. Degrasyn induced the downregulation of wild-type c-Myc and that of every deletion mutant
except the DF construct (Fig. 3B). This region spans amino acids
316 to 378 of the COOH-terminal region of c-Myc and had not
previously been shown to play a major role in c-Myc stability.
Deletion of this region increased c-Myc stability in HeLa cells and
reduced its sensitivity to destruction by degrasyn-stimulated
mechanisms. Expression of another HA-tagged signaling protein
(IKKg) in HeLa cells did not increase its sensitivity to or
destruction by degrasyn (Fig. 3C), suggesting that degrasyn targets
c-Myc and not the HA epitope.
Mapping of the #F c-Myc domain for sensitivity to
degrasyn. The DF region of c-Myc (amino acids 316–378) contains
a nuclear localization signal (NLS; 320-328) and two of three
residues that were recently shown to be phosphorylated by PAK2
(T358 and S373; refs. 23, 24; Fig. 4A). To determine the smallest
region of c-Myc necessary to reduce degrasyn-mediated c-Myc
destruction, we generated 20-amino-acid deletions within the 60amino-acid DF region by site-directed mutagenesis. The HA-tagged
wild-type c-Myc, the DF 60-amino-acid deletion mutant, or three
20-amino-acid deletion mutants (D316-335, D336-355, or D356-378)
of c-Myc (Fig. 4B) were expressed after liposomal transfection in
HeLa cells. Degrasyn induced the degradation of wild type and
D336-355 mutant of c-Myc but failed to induce the degradation of
the DF mutant. Deletion of amino acids 316 to 335 and 356 to 378
of c-Myc resulted in reduced sensitivity to degrasyn-mediated
c-Myc destruction. These observations suggest that two regions
within the DF region (316–335 and 356–378) form a critical
determinant of c-Myc that regulates its stability and its sensitivity
to degrasyn in HeLa cells.
The NLS of c-Myc is within amino acids 316 to 335, and two of
the three amino acid residues phosphorylated by PAK2 (T358 and
S373) are within amino acids 356 to 378. To determine if nuclear
localization of c-Myc is necessary for degrasyn activity, we tested
the ability of degrasyn to degrade an NLS deletion mutant of c-Myc.
Deletion of the NLS failed to inhibit degrasyn-induced degradation
of the protein (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of the T358, S373, and
T400 amino acid residues of c-Myc by PAK2 is known to induce the
rapid degradation of c-Myc (24). To test if PAK2-dependent
phosphorylation of c-Myc was important for the degrasyn
response, we generated T358A/D and S373A/D substitution
mutants of c-Myc. Again, degrasyn induced the degradation of
these c-Myc substitution mutants (Fig. 4C). These results suggest

Figure 3. Deletion of amino acids 316-378 of c-myc
decreases its sensitivity to destruction by degrasyn.
A, the mammalian expression vector for HA
epitope-tagged c-Myc was transiently expressed in
HeLa cells at the indicated amounts of cDNA. At
24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 5 Amol/L
degrasyn for 1 h, subjected to lysis, and analyzed for
c-Myc expression by Western blotting with an
anti-HA antibody. Actin was used as the protein loading
control. B, HeLa cells were transfected with the
indicated HA-tagged c-Myc deletion constructs
(at the indicated amounts of cDNA) for 24 h and then
incubated with degrasyn. Cell lysates were prepared
and immunoblotted for HA-c-Myc with anti-HA.
C, an expression vector for HA-tagged IKKg was
transfected into HeLa cells, and 24 h later, cells were

that degrasyn enhances the proteasome-mediated degradation of
c-Myc by a novel mechanism targeting c-Myc between amino acid
residues 316 to 335 and 356 to 378.
Degrasyn reduces c-Myc levels in A375 melanoma cells and
tumors. Malignant melanoma has previously been shown to
overexpress c-Myc, and re-establishing control of c-Myc levels in
these tumors may have therapeutic effects (34–37). Initial screening
of a panel of seven melanoma cell lines showed that three cell lines,
including A375 cells, were highly sensitive to the antiproliferative/
apoptotic effects of degrasyn (A375 IC50 = 1.6 Amol/L). We found
the dose-dependent antitumor activity of degrasyn to be aligned

with down-modulation of c-Myc protein levels but not other
nuclear (p53) or latent (Stat3) transcription factors (Fig. 5A) in
A375 cells. Moreover, degrasyn did not inhibit phosphorylated
mitogen-activated protein kinase in A375 tumor cells (Fig. 5A),
which has previously been shown to be play a role in c-Myc
posttranslational modification and stability (38). Because degrasynmediated c-Myc down-regulation in A375 cells was similar to that
detected in other tumor cells (MM-1 and HeLa), we assessed the
in vivo activity of degrasyn against A375 melanoma tumors
established in nude mice. For antitumor assessment, Degrasyn
was administered to nude mice at 40 mg/kg every other day for

Figure 4. Two regions within the DF domain of c-Myc are involved in its sensitivity to degrasyn. A, the DF domain of c-Myc was subjected to further deletion to
determine the smallest region necessary to reduce degrasyn-mediated c-Myc destruction. Constructs included those in which 20 amino acids were deleted within
the DF of c-Myc, the NLS (amino acids 320–328), and critical serine (S373) or threonine (T358) residues in this region. B and C, HeLa cells were transfected with the
indicated deletion constructs of HA-c-Myc (0.75 Ag) for 24 h before being treated with degrasyn for 1 h. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted for HA-c-Myc
with anti-HA. Actin was immunoblotted and used as the protein loading control.

3 weeks without acute toxicity or weight loss (data not shown).
Tumors were established by s.c. injection, and degrasyn treatment
was initiated at two stages of tumor development. Preliminary
dose-finding studies showed that the single-dose degrasyn LD10
was >120 mg/kg (given i.p. or i.v.), whereas multidose toxicity
occurred at 80 mg/kg. When administered on alternating days,
degrasyn (40 mg/kg) did not cause weight loss or induce acute or
cumulative toxicity. Initial pharmacologic assessment of i.v.
administered degrasyn (10 mg/kg) revealed a peak plasma level
of 0.8 Amol/L and a plasma elimination half-life of 4.5 h. However,
daily administration of degrasyn resulted in cumulative toxicity
that does not seem to be related to its half-life. Dosing on alternate
days suppressed tumor growth in the absence of toxicity or weight
loss. More recent studies have shown that degrasyn can be safely
administered orally (160 mg/kg every other day) with antitumor
activity that is similar to that achieved by 40 mg/kg i.p. dosing
(data not shown). In the first experiment, in which degrasyn
treatment began as soon as tumors became detectable (8 days after
tumor inoculation), degrasyn significantly suppressed melanoma
tumor growth throughout the course of treatment (Fig. 5B, top).
Assessment of c-Myc protein levels in tumors extracted from three
control-treated mice and three degrasyn-treated mice 2 h after the
final injection (day 34) showed significant reductions in c-Myc
levels in the degrasyn-treated animals (Fig. 5B, top inset). To
determine whether tumor size at initiation of therapy would
influence the response to degrasyn, tumors were allowed to grow
for an additional 9 days, resulting in a 5-fold increase in volume
(to f0.125 cm3) relative to the previous experiments (Fig. 5B,
bottom). Degrasyn suppressed tumor growth to an extent similar to
that shown in previous experiments involving animals with lower
tumor burden. Again, tumor growth inhibition was associated with
a reduction in c-Myc protein levels (Fig. 5B, bottom inset). Together,
these results show that degrasyn suppresses c-Myc protein levels
and suppresses the growth of A375 melanoma tumors in nude mice.

Discussion

indicated concentration of degrasyn for 2 h before analysis of specific
protein levels in cell lysates by Western blotting. The IC50 for degrasyn in A375
melanoma cells was 1.6 Amol/L (according to a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay). B, top, A375 tumors were established

In this study, we show that degrasyn induces c-Myc downregulation is proteasomal-dependently mediated through a novel
region not previously associated with its proteasomal degradation.
c-Myc protein stability is regulated by a NH2-terminal ‘‘degron’’
that signals c-Myc ubiquitination and a COOH-terminal ‘‘stabilon’’
that stabilizes c-Myc by enabling it to associate with the POZ
domain protein Miz or to be sequestered in a subnuclear
compartment in which it is stable (12, 17). It was initially assumed
that sequences located between the degron and stabilon were
dispensable for all aspects of c-Myc function (39, 40). However, the
region of c-Myc between amino acid residues 190 and 210 (the D
element) was recently found important for initiating the degradation of c-Myc at a post-ubiquitination stage (20). In addition,
phosphorylation of the Thr358, Ser373, and Thr400 amino acid
residues by PAK2 has been shown to reduce c-Myc interaction with
Max and to induce degradation of c-Myc through an unknown
process (23, 24). Here, we characterized a region of c-Myc between
amino acid residues 316 to 378 that is important for the small
molecule degrasyn to induce proteasomal degradation of c-Myc in
tumor cells.
The pattern of phosphorylation of two key amino acid residues
Thr58 and Ser62 is critical for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of
c-Myc (10) as point mutations at these sites increase the stability of
the c-Myc protein (12, 41–43). Here, we show that degrasyn induced

Degrasyn and Proteasomal-Dependent Degradation of c-Myc

the rapid degradation of c-Myc deletion mutants lacking both
Thr58 and Ser62 residues, but mutants devoid of a specific COOHterminal region (amino acids 316–378) seem to be important for
c-Myc stability and necessary for degrasyn-induced c-Myc degradation. The degrasyn-dependent mechanism leading to c-Myc
degradation seems to be novel, and we have not detected c-Myc
ubiquitination in degrasyn-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that this compound may induce a form of ubiquitinindependent proteasome-like proteolysis.
The DF deletion mutant of c-Myc (amino acids 316–378) strongly
suppressed the c-Myc down-regulatory activity of degrasyn
(Fig. 4B) when compared with smaller deletion mutants from this
domain (amino acids 316–335 and 356–378). Interestingly, deletion
of amino acids 336 to 355 failed to inhibit the activity of degrasyn,
suggesting that a structural motif retained or formed by these
regions (316–335 and 356–378) is necessary to engage a complete
degrasyn response. The c-Myc NLS (320–328) is situated within the
316-335 region, and two of the PAK2 phosphorylation sites (S373
and T358) reside within the 356 to 378 segment. To test if either
intracellular localization or PAK2 activation or a combination of
both activities were necessary for the degrasyn response, we
generated an NLS deletion mutant as well as S373A and T358A
substitution mutants and observed that these mutants did not
inhibit degrasyn activity (Fig. 4B and C). These results indicate that
degrasyn-induced degradation of c-Myc proceeds through a novel
proteasomal-dependent pathway mediated through a region of
c-Myc that has not been previously defined as a major regulator of
c-Myc stability. Recent studies have shown that a region of N-Myc
between amino acid residues 317 and 337 may be important for
regulation of N-Myc function (44). Deletion of this region caused
changes in the induction of apoptosis, transformation, and G2
arrest. One of the regions of c-Myc identified in our study as a
mediator of the degrasyn response almost completely overlaps with
the N-Myc region identified by Cowling et al. as being important for
its activity. As c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc are highly conserved (45),
it is tempting to postulate that the region of c-Myc between amino
acid residues 316 and 335 may be important for both c-Myc and

n-Myc stability. The effect of degrasyn on N-Myc and L-Myc protein
levels has not been thoroughly investigated.
Tissue- and organ-specific induction of c-Myc expression induces
cellular transformation in a broad variety of cell types, including
prostate (46), breast (47), and liver (48), and its induction may
underlie the self-renewal ability of hematopoietic stem cells (49).
Recent evidence suggests that even transient inhibition of c-Myc can
reverse cellular transformation (46–49). Collectively, these findings
illustrate the significant potential for compounds that disrupt or
inhibit c-Myc to function as antitumor agents or to synergize with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents (50). Clearly, small molecular
weight antitumor compounds that induce the rapid and specific
degradation of c-Myc could have significant therapeutic activity against
many human cancers. Because most c-Myc mutations increase protein
stability through alterations in the NH2-terminal degron, it may be
advantageous to develop agents that target the COOH-terminal region
to induce protein turnover. Because of its unique mechanism of
action, degrasyn may have the potential to affect c-Myc levels in
several human tumors, thereby increasing its therapeutic potential.
To address this potential, we conducted pilot antitumor
experiments with A375 melanoma tumor xenografts growing in
nude mice. Although degrasyn causes tumor regression and
modulates c-Myc levels in vitro and in vivo, it is not clear whether
the latter activity is solely responsible for the antitumor activity of
this compound. Additional studies are needed to address this
possibility. However, the unique mechanism of c-Myc regulation by
degrasyn and its antitumor activity support further assessment of
its biological and therapeutic properties.
