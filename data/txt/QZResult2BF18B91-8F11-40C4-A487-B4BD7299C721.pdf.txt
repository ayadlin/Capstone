ABSTRACT
Cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis are essential steps in cancer cell
growth. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a therapeutic target for 5FU. We tested the
hypothesis that HSP90 transcriptional and functional inhibition can inhibit cell cycle
progression, downregulate TS levels and sensitize colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines
to the effects of 5FU. Treatment with ganetespib (50nM) for 24 hours inhibited
cyclin D1 and pRb at the transcriptional and translational levels and induced p21,
leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both CRC cell lines (HCT-116 and HT-29). This
was associated with downregulation of E2F1 and its target gene TS. In addition,
ganetespib inhibited PI3K/Akt and ERK signalling pathways. Similar effects were
observed with HSP90 knockdown in both cell lines. Ganetespib sensitized CRC cell
lines to the effects of oxaliplatin and 5FU. Similar effects were also observed in tumors
from animals treated with ganetespib, oxaliplatin and 5FU. In this study, we present
in vitro and animal data supporting that the targeting of HSP90 decreases CRC cell
survival and proliferation. Ganetespib sensitizes CRC cell lines to the effects of 5FUbased chemotherapy. Combining HSP90 inhibitors with chemotherapy is a rational
approach for future drug development in CRC.

INTRODUCTION

5’-monophosphate (dTMP) [4].
Preclinical and clinical data suggest a link between
the activation of cellular proliferative signalling pathways
and resistance to chemotherapy [5]. Inhibition of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown
in clinical settings to restore sensitivity to cytotoxic
chemotherapy [6]. This suggests that the EGFR pathway
contributes to chemoresistance [7]. Constitutive activating
mutations in the Ras or Raf genes occur in approximately
45 and 10% of CRC, respectively [8, 9]. Clinical data
indicates that patients with activating mutations in Ras
or Raf have a worse prognosis [10]. In preclinical CRC
models, activation of EGFR, IGFR or their downstream
signalling pathways involving Ras, Raf, or Akt leads to
increased proliferation and resistance to therapy [11],
[12]. Growth promoting signals through these pathways

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of mortality in the United States [1]. Approximately 30%
of patients with CRC present with advanced stage disease
[2]. Although a significant improvement in overall survival
has been observed in patients with stage IV CRC, the five
year survival rate remains below 20% which highlights
the importance of developing newer and more effective
systemic therapies [1]. De novo or acquired resistance
to systemic chemotherapy regimens remains a major
challenge in the management of CRC. Fluoropyrimidine
(5FU)-based chemotherapy remains the treatment of
choice for this group of patients [3]. 5FU is a nucleotide
analogue that inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), a key
enzyme in the de novo synthesis of 2’-deoxythymidinewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lead to activation of c-myc and cyclin D1 [11], [13]. This
in turn results in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb),
releasing E2F transcriptional factors [14]. E2F1 plays a
central role in cell proliferation through controlling the
transition of cells from the G1 to S phase [15]. E2F1 also
transcribes genes related to DNA synthesis and repair
that are involved in cancer cell growth and resistance
[16], including excision repair genes (ERCC-1), known
to confer resistance to platinum agents, and TS [17].
Kasahara et al. [17] observed that TS expression correlates
closely with transcriptional factor E2F1 expression in 23
colon cancer patient samples. High levels of TS expression
have been associated with resistance to 5-FU [18].
Therefore, activation of E2F1 may provide a common
pathway that explains at a molecular level the relationship
between proliferation and resistance to therapy.
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a chaperone
protein that regulates the stability and trafficking of
several client proteins involved in cell proliferation [19].
Ganetespib is a small molecule inhibitor of HSP90 [20],
which has shown encouraging single agent activity and
a promising safety profile in early clinical trials [21].
Based on preclinical and clinical data, we hypothesize that
inhibiting HSP90 activity will result in degradation of its
client proteins and disruption of proliferative signalling
pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and downregulation
of TS, thereby sensitizing CRC cells to the effects of
standard chemotherapy agents. To test this hypothesis, we
evaluated the effect of inhibiting HSP90 by ganetespib or
by genetic knockdown on proliferation and resistance to
chemotherapy in CRC models.

the downregulation of these molecules was associated
with a decrease in the expression of pRb (Fig.1C).
E2F transcription factors are key regulators of the cell
cycle effects of Rb [25]. In both cell lines, treatment
with ganetespib resulted in downregulation of E2F1
transcription factor (Fig. 1C & D). These molecular effects
explain the G0/G1 arrest. One of the proteins transcribed
by E2F1 is thymidylate synthase (TS) [17]. Treatment with
ganetespib resulted in downregulation of the expression of
TS at the protein and mRNA levels in both cell lines (Fig.
1C & 1D).

Ganetespib inhibits EGFR and IGFR pathways
in CRC cells
Growth stimulatory signals are known to activate
c-myc and cyclinD/ cdk leading to cell proliferation.
HSP90 is a known chaperone protein for several proteins
in the EGFR and IGFR signalling pathways. Treatment
with ganetespib resulted in downregulation of EGFR
and IGFR protein expression in both cell lines (Fig. 2).
In addition, inhibition of HSP90 downregulated several
key kinases in these signalling pathways including PI-3K,
pAKT, pBRaf, JNK, pJNK, pP38, and pERK (Fig. 2) in
both cell lines.

Effects of HSP90 knock-down on survival and cell
cycle regulatory molecules in human CRC cells
In order to confirm that the observed effects of
ganetespib are mediated through HSP90, we transfected
HCT-116 and HT-29 cells with HSP90 shRNA or
scrambled vector. Transfection with HSP90 shRNA
resulted in a decrease in HSP90 expression levels
compared to the scrambled vector transfection and the
non-transfected cell lines (Fig. 3A). The knockdown of
HSP90 decreased the expression of EGFR, IGFR, PI3K, pAKT, pP38, and pERK (Fig. 3A). Treatment with
ganetespib did not affect the expression levels of EGFR,
IGFR, PI-3K, pAKT, pP38, and pERK in HSP90 shRNA
transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Similarly, transfection with
HSP90 shRNA resulted in an increase in p21 expression
levels compared to the scrambled vector transfection and
the non-transfected cell lines (Fig. 3B). The knockdown
of HSP90 decreased the expression of CDK4, cyclinD1,
pRb, E2F1, and TS (Fig. 3B). Treatment with ganetespib
did not affect the expression levels of CDK4, cyclinD1,
pRb, E2F1, and TS in HSP90 shRNA transfected cells
(Fig. 3B).

RESULTS
Ganetespib induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and
p21 and inhibits Cdk4, cyclin D1, and pRb in
human colorectal cancer
Analysis of DNA content using flow cytometry
revealed that ganetespib induced G0/G1 arrest in both
cell lines (Fig. 1A & B). To understand the mechanism
underlying this cell cycle effect, the protein and mRNA
levels of cell cycle related HSP90 client proteins were
evaluated. The protein and mRNA expression levels
of CDK4 and cyclin D1 were significantly decreased
in ganetespib treated CRC cells compared to controls
in both cell lines (Fig. 1C & D). Since cyclin D1 and
CDK4 are regulated by c-myc [22] and tumor suppressor
gene p21 [23], the expression of c-myc and p21 was
measured in untreated and ganetespib treated CRC cell
lines. The protein and mRNA expression levels of p21
were increased while the level of c-myc was decreased
after ganetespib treatment (Fig. 1C & 1D). Cyclin D1
and CDK4 phosphorylate Rb [24], and as expected

ganetespib also downregulated the expression of TS

xenografts.

Ganetespib sensitizes human CRC cell lines and
tumor xenografts to 5FU and oxaliplatin
A clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the effect
of combining ganetespib with the standard chemotherapy
agents 5FU and oxaliplatin. In both cell lines, 5FU and
oxaliplatin resulted in significant inhibition of colony
formation when compared to untreated cells (Fig. 5A). The
addition of ganetespib to 5FU and oxaliplatin resulted in
a significantly greater reduction in colony formation when
compared to 5FU and oxaliplatin treated cell lines (Fig.
5A). This potentiation was observed in both cell lines.
Both 5-FU and oxaliplatin inhibited tumor growth
as compared to the control group in HT-29 and HCT116 xenografts (Fig. 5B). The combination of 5FU and
oxaliplatin was significantly (p<0.001) more effective
than either agent alone in both models. The addition
of ganetespib to 5FU, oxaliplatin or the combination
resulted in a significant (p<0.001) increase in tumor
growth inhibition as compared to the tumors treated with

Finally, we evaluated the effects of treatment with
5FU and oxaliplatin alone, combined, and in combination
with ganetespib on the expression of pERK, c-myc, cyclin
D1, pRb, E2F1 and TS (Fig. 5C). Combining ganetespib
with 5FU, oxaliplatin or the combination resulted in

significant (p<0.001) downregulation of proliferative and
cell cycle signalling pathways including inhibition of
pERK, p21, cdk4, c-myc, cyclin D1 and E2F1 (Fig. 5C).
This was associated with downregulation of expression of
TS in the ganetespib treated tumors (Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION

cyclin D1 and E2F1 pathways represent a rational target
for therapeutic intervention because their activation is
common in CRC patients, induces proliferation, and may
contribute to resistance to therapy.
Given the complexity of the proliferative signalling
pathways, targeting these pathways would require the
inhibition of multiple key proteins. In this study, we have
demonstrated that inhibiting HSP90 with ganetespib or by
genetic knockdown results in inhibition of proliferative
pathways at multiple levels including surface growth
factor receptors (EGFR, IGF-1R) and downstream
pathways (PI3K, pAkt, Raf, p38, pJNK, and pERK;
Fig. 6). These effects were seen in two CRC cell lines,
one with Ras mutation (HCT-116) and one with a B-Raf
mutation (HT-29). The concentrations of ganetespib
used in these experiments were based on the previously
identified IC50 for HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines [35]. This
concentration is comparable to the concentration achieved
in phase I clinical trials [36]. The effects of ganetespib on
proliferative pathways were also seen in vivo using tumor
xenograft models.
The inhibition of HSP90 resulted in decreased
phosphorylation of Rb and consequently decreased
release of E2F1 and arrest of cell cycle at G0-G1 (Fig. 6).
Among the proteins transcribed by E2F1, we focused our
attention on TS, the target for 5FU. TS has been shown
to be a prognostic factor for patients with stage II and III
disease [37]. Clinical studies have shown an association
between TS expression and resistance to 5FU in advanced
stage CRC [18, 38]. Similar relationships between TS
expression and resistance to 5FU have been observed
in pancreatic [39], and head and neck[40] cancers. In
addition to expression, structural alterations in TS that
affect its affinity to 5FU may contribute to resistance. Such

Sustaining proliferative signalling is a hallmark
of cancer [26]. Proliferative signalling pathways are
commonly dysregulated in colorectal cancer. For example,
the EGFR is known to be overexpressed and activated
in CRC tumors and cells [27], and its inhibition results
in restoration of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents
[6]. Similarly, IGF-1 and IGF-1R are known to be
overexpressed in CRC [6]. Chemoresistant colorectal cell
lines have been shown to have an increased expression
and activation of IGF-1R [28]. Furthermore, inhibition of
IGF-1R has been shown to sensitize CRC cell lines to the
effects of chemotherapy. Proliferative signalling pathways
downstream of the EGFR and IGF-1R are also commonly
dysregulated in CRC [10]. Activating mutations in Ras
and Raf genes are known to occur in approximately 45%
and 15% of CRC, respectively [29], [30]. These mutations
have been associated with poor overall survival as well as
resistance to chemotherapy [31], [32]. Activation of these
proliferative signalling pathways results in activation of
ERK leading to phosphorylation and activation of cyclin
D1[27], [33]. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) gene are known to occur in approximately 60% of
all CRC patients [32] and result in activation of β-catenin/
Tcf4 which in turn activates cyclin D1 [30]. Cyclin D1
together with its binding partners, cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK)-4 and CDK6, forms active complexes that
promote G1- to S-phase progression by phosphorylating
and inactivating the Rb protein [29]. E2F1 transcription
factor is released from pRb allowing it to translocate to the
nucleus and transcribe genes related to DNA replication,
DNA repair and cell cycle regulation [34]. Therefore, the

EGFR, PI3K, AKT, MEK, cdk4 are client proteins of HSP90. HSP90 induces cell cycle progression through modulation of EGFR/PI-3K/
Akt and Raf/ERK pathways as well as stabilization of cdk4/Cyclin D1. Functional inhibition of HSP90 by ganetespib suppresses cell cycle
progression by inhibiting the survival pathways and phosphorylation of Rb.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

a resistant variant of TS has been shown to occur in the
HCT-116 cell line [41]. In this study, we demonstrate that
inhibition of HSP90 can downregulate the transcription
and expression of TS in HT-29 and HCT-116 cell lines.
Modulation of TS represents a novel mechanism that may
further explain the observed sensitization of CRC[42]
and bladder cancer cell lines[43] to HSP90 inhibitors.
Treatment with 5FU has been associated with induction of
TS expression leading to acquired resistance to 5FU [4].
In the current study, we did not observe any increase in TS
expression in tumors from animals treated with 5FU and
ganetespib, suggesting that inhibition of HSP90 may delay
or prevent this mechanism of acquired resistance.
In addition to the effects on proliferation and
TS expression, ganetespib has been shown to be a
potent antiangiogenic agent in CRC models [44]. The
antiangiogenic effects are mediated through inhibition of
HIF-1α and STAT-3, leading to downregulation of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription [44]. The
effects of ganetespib on VEGF expression were also
demonstrated using pre and post treatment biopsies from
patients with rectal cancer [44]. Randomized clinical trials
have already demonstrated the benefit of combining VEGF
targeting agents with chemotherapy in stage IV CRC.[45,
46] Ganetespib also inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in CRC cell lines [35]. EMT is known to
be associated with increased invasiveness and resistance
to therapy [35]. Based on its anti-invasive, antiangiogenic
and anti-proliferative effects, we evaluated the
combination of ganetespib with standard chemotherapy
in cell line and animal models. The results confirm that
ganetespib can potentiate the growth inhibition of 5FU
and oxaliplatin in both Ras and Raf mutated cell lines.
Our results are in agreement with previously published
literature. Moser et al. [47] had demonstrated that 17DMAG, an HSP90 inhibitor, can sensitize p53 deficient
CRC cells to the effects of oxaliplatin.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that inhibition
of HSP90 can sensitize CRC cells to the effects of
chemotherapy through inhibition of proliferative signalling
pathways and downregulation of TS. Ganetespib has
already demonstrated an excellent safety profile in
clinical trials. In a phase II trial of ganetespib in heavily
pre-treated patients with stage IV CRC, 2/15 patients
had stable disease and no objective responses were seen
[48]. Although single agent ganetespib may have limited
activity in CRC, combining it with 5FU and oxaliplatin is
a rational approach based on the safety profile, mechanism
of action and the preclinical data from animal models.
Elevated baseline TS expression may be a useful clinical
biomarker to select patients who might benefit from
combining ganetespib with fluoropyrimidine.

Cells and reagents
CRC cell lines HCT-116 and HT-29 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) in 2011. Characterization and authentication were
reported by ATCC in the accompanying certificate of
analysis. Cultures had been validated by ATCC to be
Mycoplasma-free, expressed only basal epithelial cell
markers and unique human DNA profile. They were
subsequently cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium contain
1.5 mM L-glutamine and 2200 mg/L sodium bicarbonate
(Cat # ATCC® 30-2007TM , ATCC, Manassas, VA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cat # 4135;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 units/ml penicillin, and
50 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Frederick,
MD). Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. In our previous experiments, we
demonstrated that the IC50 of ganetespib in both HT-29
and HCT-116 cells was 50 nM.[35] Specific antibodies
against HSP90, PI-3K, Akt, pAkt, EGFR, pERK, MEK,
cMyc, CDK4, cyclinD1, p21, pRb, E2F1, TS, β-actin,
and HRP (horseradish peroxidase) conjugated secondary
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signalling (Beverly,
MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). HSP90
shRNA and scrambled vector (SV) were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Ganetespib was
obtained from Synta Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA).
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO).

Clonogenicity assay
For this experiment, HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were
treated with vehicle, ganetespib (50nM), 5FU (10 μM ) /
oxaliplatin (2.5 μM) or ganetespib (50nM)/ 5FU (10 μM)
/oxaliplatin (2.5 μM). HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were
seeded (100 cells/well) in triplicate in 6-well plates. The
media was changed 24 hours after platting and the cells
were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or ganetespib.
Twenty four hours after first treatment, media was changed
and the cells were either treated with oxaliplatin and 5FU
or vehicle for another 24hr. Media was changed once every
3 days without treatment. On the 12th day, the medium
was removed and cell colonies were stained with crystal
violet (0.1% in 20% methanol). Colony numbers were
assessed visually and colonies containing >50 normalappearing cells were counted. Assays were performed in
triplicate.

reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, USA). To
determine the transcript levels from cDNA, qRT-PCR
was carried out with 1 µL of cDNA using specific primers
(gene and primer details given in Table 1). The qRT-PCR

ganetespib (50nM) as described above and were harvested
after 24 hours and fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 hour at 4°C.
The cells were stained with propidium iodide (BioSure,
Grass Valley, CA) for 15 min in the dark and FACS
analysis was performed using a Becton-Dickinson FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Assays
were performed in duplicate.
Results were analyzed with Flow-Jo (TreeStar Inc.,
Ashland, OR) software.

Transfection studies

Western blotting and immunoprecipitation

Transfection studies were performed as previously
described [35]. For HSP90 knockdown studies, HCT-116
and HT-29 cells were plated at sub-confluent densities.
The following day, the HCT-116 and HT-29 cells were
transfected with either SV or HSP90 shRNA by using
Lipopectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen).
Cells were harvested at 48 h for Western blot and qRTPCR analyses. Knockdown of HSP90 was confirmed by
Western blot and qRT- PCR analyses.

Western blotting was performed as previously
described [35]. Briefly, CRC cells were treated with
vehicle (DMSO) or ganetespib (50 nM) for 24 hours,
then harvested and lysed in RIPA protein extraction
buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, MO). Protein extracts were then analyzed
by Western blotting. Briefly, equal amounts of protein
fractions of lysates were resolved over SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membrane. Membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies followed by HRPconjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies were
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL
System; Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). To confirm
equal loading, membranes were verified by re-probing
with an antibody specific for the housekeeping gene, antiβ-actin.

In vivo tumor growth inhibition study
Tumor growth inhibition study was performed as
previously described [35]. Five to six-week-old female
nude mice were obtained (Harlan, Indianapolis, Indiana)
and maintained in a pathogen-free environment. All in
vivo procedures were approved by Emory University’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. HCT-116
and HT-29 cells (2 x 106) were subcutaneously grafted into
the mice and were divided into 8 groups with 5 mice in
each group. When tumors reached 100 ± 10 mm3, groups
(3, 4, and 7) received ganetespib (100 mg/kg body weight)
intravenously once weekly for three weeks. Groups (2, 4,
6, and 8) received 5FU (30mg/kg) and groups (5, 6, 7,

and 8) received oxaliplatin (5mg/kg) intravenously once
weekly (after 24hr of ganetespib treatment) for three
weeks. None of the animals died from the treatment.
Every third day, tumor size was measured using vernier
caliper scale for a total of three weeks, when the animals
were anesthetized with ketamine and sacrificed by cervical
dislocation. Tumor growth inhibition was determined as
previously described [35]. Tumor samples were used for
Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis.
