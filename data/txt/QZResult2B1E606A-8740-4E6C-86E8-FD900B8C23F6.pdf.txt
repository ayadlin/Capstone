Abstract
Recent findings have highlighted that constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is a common feature of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where it upregulates cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. These observations lend
compelling weight to the application of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in the therapy of T-ALL. Here, we have
analyzed the therapeutic potential of the novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, an orally bioavailable
imidazoquinoline derivative, which has entered clinical trials for solid tumors, on both T-ALL cell lines
and patient samples. NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to a panel of T-ALL cell lines as determined by MTT assays.
NVP-BEZ235 treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blots showed a dose- and timedependent dephosphorylation of Akt and mTORC1 downstream targets in response to NVP-BEZ235. Remarkably, NVP-BEZ235 targeted the side population of both T-ALL cell lines and patient lymphoblasts, which might
correspond to leukemia-initiating cells, and synergized with chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide,
cytarabine, dexamethasone) currently used for treating T-ALL patients. NVP-BEZ235 reduced chemoresistance
to vincristine induced in Jurkat cells by coculturing with MS-5 stromal cells, which mimic the bone marrow
microenvironment. NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to T-ALL patient lymphoblasts displaying pathway activation,
where the drug dephosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, at variance with rapamycin. Taken together, our findings indicate that longitudinal inhibition at two nodes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
network with NVP-BEZ235, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, may be an efficient
treatment of those T-ALLs that have aberrant upregulation of this signaling pathway for their proliferation
and survival. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8097–107. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive disorder of precursor cells committed to the T-cell lineage (1). Over the past 20 years, survival rates of T-ALL
patients have improved, mainly because of advances in chemotherapy protocols. Survival rates at 5 years for children

and adolescents with T-ALL are 70% to 75%, whereas for
adults, the rates are 35% to 40% (2). In spite of these
improvements, novel and less toxic treatment strategies for
T-ALL are needed (3). Novel therapies may target aberrantly
activated signaling pathways influencing the proliferation,
survival, and drug resistance of these T-ALLs. One such pathway is represented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network (4, 5). Pathway upregulation in T-ALL is due to
several reasons, which include Notch1 activation leading to
HES1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1)-mediated transcriptional suppression of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin deleted
on chromosome 10) gene (6, 7), PTEN phosphorylation or
oxidation (8), interleukin (IL)-4 secreted by bone marrow
stromal cells (9), or mutations affecting PI3K, PTEN, or Akt
(10). About 85% of T-ALL patients display increased PI3K/
Akt/mTOR activation at diagnosis (8, 11). mTOR exists as
two complexes, referred to as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2; ref. 12). Allosteric mTOR
inhibitors, which include rapamycin and its analogues (rapalogues), mainly target mTORC1. These inhibitors display
promising effects in preclinical models of T-ALL (13, 14).

However, rapamycin/rapalogues are mainly cytostatic (15)
and could hyperactivate Akt due to the existence of feedback
loops between mTORC1, PI3K, and Akt (16). Moreover, it is
beginning to emerge that there are mTORC1 functions,
including phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor
4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1; which controls translation),
which are insensitive to rapamycin/rapalogues (17, 18). Recently, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have been synthesized,
which, unlike rapamycin/rapalogues, target the catalytic site
of both kinases (19). As such, these compounds are proapoptotic and dephosphorylate 4E-BP1. We have recently
shown the cytotoxic effect of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
PI-103 in preclinical settings of T-ALL (20). PI-103 has proven
efficacy also in vivo against models of human tumors xenografted in mice, where it displayed low toxicity and was well
tolerated (19). However, PI-103 did not enter clinical trials,
mainly because of its rapid in vivo metabolism (21). Here,
we have analyzed the therapeutic potential of the novel dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, an orally bioavailable
imidazoquinoline derivative (22), which has entered clinical
trials for solid tumors, in both T-ALL cell lines and patient
samples. We have shown that this drug displayed strong
cytotoxic activity against T-ALL cells. Rapid commitment
of T-ALL cells to death was triggered by NVP-BEZ235. Importantly, healthy donor peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were
much less sensitive than the T-ALL cell lines tested, suggesting a favorable therapeutic index. Combinations of NVPBEZ235 with conventional anti–T-ALL chemotherapeutic
agents showed a strong synergistic activity, implying that
these NVP-BEZ235–based combinations could be feasible
in the clinic. Thus, our results provide the framework for
clinical trials of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235 to improve patient outcome in T-ALL.

Materials and Methods
Materials
NVP-BEZ235 was kindly provided by Novartis. For Western
blotting, primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rapamycin, vincristine, dexamethasone,
cyclophosphamide, cytarabine (Ara-C), Hoechst 33342, and
fumitremorgin C were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PI-103
was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. KO143 was purchased
from Axon Medchem BV. Antibody to ABCG2 was from Millipore/Upstate, antibody to 170-kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was
from Kamiya, and antibody to MRP1 was from BD Biosciences
Pharmingen. AlexaFluor-conjugated antibodies to PTEN,
Ser473 p-Akt, Thr37/46 p-4E-BP1, and Ser235/236 p-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6RP) were from Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell culture and primary samples
The T-ALL cell lines Jurkat, MOLT-4, CEM-S, CEM-R (CEM
VBL100, drug-resistant cells overexpressing P-gp; ref. 23),
RPMI-8402, and BE-13 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All cell lines
were from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH and were characterized as specified

(http://www.dsmz.de/human_and_animal_cell_lines/main.
php?contentleft_id=21). Patient samples or peripheral blood
CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors were obtained
with informed consent according to institutional guidelines
and isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) for
patient lymphoblasts or by magnetic labeling (Miltenyi Biotec) for CD4+ T lymphocytes. CD4+ T lymphocytes (105 per
well) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and
stimulated for 24 hours with a mixture of 10 μg/mL phytohemagglutinin-M (PHA-M) and 50 ng/mL human recombinant IL-2 to induce proliferation.
Cell viability analysis
MTT assays were performed to assess the sensitivity of
cells to drugs, as previously described (24).
Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining
To determine the extent of apoptosis induction, flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI)–
stained samples was performed (24). Samples were analyzed
by an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) with the
appropriate software (System II, Beckman Coulter). At least
15,000 events per sample were acquired.
Cell cycle analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using PI/RNase A
staining according to standard procedures, as described
previously (24).
Transmission electron microscopy
This was performed as described previously (25).
Western blot analysis
This was performed by standard methods, as previously
reported (24). Analysis with an antibody to β-actin showed
equal protein loading.
Coculture with mouse MS-5 stromal cells
Jurkat cells (1 × 10 6/mL) were seeded on top of MS-5
mouse stromal cells (at ∼70% confluence) for 3 hours before
the addition of NVP-BEZ235 alone, vincristine alone, or a
combination of NVP-BEZ235 and vincristine. After 24 hours
of incubation at 37°C, cells were harvested with trypsin/
EDTA, washed, and resuspended in binding buffer containing
Annexin V-FITC. Cells were counterstained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody or with an irrelevant
isotypic control antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry after
electronic gating on CD45+ leukemia cells (26).
Combined drug effect analysis
The combination effect and a potential synergy were evaluated from quantitative analysis of dose-effect relationships
as described previously (24). For each combination experiment, a combination index (CI) number was calculated using
the Biosoft CalcuSyn software. This method of analysis generally defines CI values of 0.9 to 1.1 as additive, 0.3 to 0.9 as
synergistic, and <0.3 as strongly synergistic, whereas values
>1.1 are considered antagonistic.

NVP-BEZ235–Mediated Cytotoxicity in T-ALL

Flow cytometric analysis of PTEN, p-Akt (Ser473),
p-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), and p-S6RP (Ser235/236) levels
in MS-5 cells or T-ALL patient samples
MS-5 cells or lymphoblasts from pediatric patients with
T-ALL were fixed in reagent 1 of the Intraprep Kit (Beckman
Coulter) and permeabilized with saponin-based reagent 2, as
reported elsewhere (20). Cells were incubated with primary
antibodies conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 647.
A rabbit IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor
647 was used as an irrelevant antibody. Cells were analyzed
on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). At least 5,000
events per sample were acquired.
Flow cytometric detection of T-ALL side
population cells
Cells were resuspended at 1 × 106/mL in prewarmed
RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS. Hoechst 33342 dye was added

to a final concentration of 5 μg/mL in the presence or
the absence of KO143 (0.1 μmol/L) or fumitremorgin C
(10 μmol/L) and the cells were incubated at 37°C for
90 minutes with intermittent shaking. In some experiments, cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to
ABC membrane transporters (P-gp, MRP1, and ABCG2),
followed by a PE-conjugated secondary antibody. Control
samples were analyzed with an irrelevant isotypic PEconjugated antibody. Cells were then washed with PBS
containing 2% bovine serum albumin and processed
for Hoechst 33342 staining. Samples were analyzed with
a Cell Lab Quanta SC (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer
equipped with UV lamp and 488 solid state laser. The
Hoechst 33342 dye was excited at 366 nm. Side population
(SP) cells were gated by the FL1/FL3 histogram, whereas
ABC transporter staining was evaluated on the FL2
channel (27, 28).

Results
NVP-BEZ235 has cytotoxic proapoptotic effects on
T-ALL cell lines
The effects of NVP-BEZ235 on T-ALL cells were analyzed by
first treating the cells with increasing concentrations of the
drug and analyzing the rates of survival by MTT assays. Most
cell lines displayed an IC50 for NVP-BEZ235 ranging from 80 to
400 nmol/L, whereas the IC50 for BE-13 cells (which do not
display p-Akt; see following discussion) was 1 μmol/L. The
drug-resistant CEM-R cell line had the highest sensitivity to
NVP-BEZ235 (IC50, 80 nmol/L; Fig. 1A). Next, a comparison
was made between NVP-BEZ235 and PI-103, another dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. When used at equimolar concentrations, PI-103 was less effective than NVP-BEZ235 in affecting
T-ALL cell line growth (Fig. 1B) at all the concentrations tested.
The effects of NVP-BEZ235 on the induction of apoptosis
were determined with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining in MOLT4, Jurkat, and CEM-R cells. After 6 hours of NVP-BEZ235
treatment, flow cytometry analysis documented an increase
in apoptosis in all the cell lines analyzed (Fig. 1C). Western
blotting analysis of extracts from MOLT-4, Jurkat, and CEMR cells treated with NVP-BEZ235 for 1, 3, and 6 hours showed

cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-9, and procaspase-3
(Fig. 1D).
NVP-BEZ235 blocks cells in the G0/G1 phase of
the cell cycle
Given the fundamental role played by PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling in cell proliferation (29), the effects of NVPBEZ235 on cell cycle progression were also investigated.
Flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained T-ALL cells treated
with NVP-BEZ235 for 16 hours documented an increase in
G0/G1 phase cells and a concomitant decrease in S and
G2-M phases in both MOLT-4 and CEM-R cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As pRb is a critical regulator of the cell
cycle transition from G1 to S phase (30), its phosphorylation
state was analyzed by Western blotting. We detected a
decrease in the amount of Ser807/811 pRb in MOLT-4 and
CEM-R cells treated with 200 nmol/L NVP-BEZ235 for
16 hours, whereas total pRb levels remained unchanged
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).
In contrast, CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and stimulated with PHA-M
plus IL-2 were much less sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 concentrations up to 500 nmol/L. The analysis, carried out by means

NVP-BEZ235–Mediated Cytotoxicity in T-ALL

Figure 3. The combination of NVP-BEZ235 with conventional chemotherapeutic agents is synergistic in T-ALL cell lines. Cells were cultured in the
presence of cyclophosphamide (Cyclo; nmol/L) or Ara-C and NVP-BEZ235 (NVP; nmol/L) alone or in combination at a fixed ratio. The combined treatment
was highly effective in inducing cytotoxicity, as shown by MTT assays at 24 h. Points, mean of at least three different experiments; bars, SD. The CI
value for each data point was calculated with the appropriate software for dose effect analysis (CalcuSyn).

of flow cytometry of PI-stained samples, documented only a
slight increase in G0/G1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). No
apoptosis was detected in these cells (data not shown). Overall, these findings showed that NVP-BEZ235 potently reduced
the growth of T-ALL cell lines and that this effect was due to
both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, these results
also suggested that the drug could have a favorable therapeutic index, as it did not significantly affect the proliferation
of normal CD4+ T lymphocytes.
NVP-BEZ235 induces autophagy
As mTORC1 is an inhibitor of autophagy (31), it was investigated whether NVP-BEZ235 could indeed induce autophagy in T-ALL cells. Induction of autophagy was confirmed
by transmission electron microscopy analysis, the golden
standard for autophagy studies, which documented the
presence of autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm of NVPBEZ235–treated CEM-S cells. Similar results were detected
in MOLT-4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In CEM-S cells
treated with NVP-BEZ235 for 16 hours, we observed an increase in Beclin-1, a well-established autophagy marker
(ref. 32; Supplementary Fig. S2B). In addition, we studied
the cleavage of LC3, which is the only known mammalian
protein that stably associates with the autophagosome
membranes (33). Indeed, LC3 can be detected as LC3-A
(cytosolic) and LC3-B (membrane bound and enriched in
the autophagic vacuole fraction) forms. NVP-BEZ235 treatment caused an increase in LC3-B (cleaved fragment;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Because it is now emerging that

www.aacrjournals.org

autophagy could represent a mechanism of protection
implemented by cells treated with mTORC1 inhibitors
(34), it was investigated if an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, could potentiate the proapoptotic effects of NVPBEZ235. However, chloroquine actually slightly decreased
the number of apoptotic CEM-S cells when used in combination with NVP-BEZ235, even if this decrease was not
statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These
results implied that autophagy induced by NVP-BEZ235
has no protective effect against apoptosis.
NVP-BEZ235 affects PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in T-ALL
cell lines
Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent decrease
in Ser473 p-Akt after 24 hours of treatment with the drug in
all the cell lines (Fig. 2A). BE-13 cells did not display Akt
phosphorylated on Ser473. Total Akt levels were unaffected
by NVP-BEZ235. mTORC1 downstream substrates (p70S6K,
4E-BP1, and S6RP) were also efficiently dephosphorylated
by NVP-BEZ235, whereas their total levels did not change
(Fig. 2A). A time-dependent study was also performed, which
documented that NVP-BEZ235 (200 nmol/L) dephosphorylated Akt and S6RP already after 1 hour of treatment, whereas p70S6K and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation was detected after
6 hours of treatment (Fig. 2B).
NVP-BEZ235 synergizes with chemotherapeutic drugs
It was investigated whether NVP-BEZ235 could synergize
with drugs commonly used for treating T-ALL patients.

T-ALL cell lines were incubated for 24 hours with the drugs
alone, NVP-BEZ235 alone, or the drugs plus NVP-BEZ235 at
a fixed ratio (NVP-BEZ235/cyclophosphamide, 1:10; NVPBEZ235/Ara-C, 1:1). MTT assays were then performed. Analysis of the results proved that NVP-BEZ235 synergized with
all the tested drugs; however, the synergism was particularly
strong with Ara-C. CI analysis documented the existence of a
strong synergism (CI < 0.3) at NVP-BEZ235 concentrations
that were well below its IC50 (Fig. 3). Moreover, in RPMI8402 cells, NVP-BEZ235 synergized with dexamethasone
(data not shown).
NVP-BEZ235 reduces chemoresistance to vincristine
induced in Jurkat cells by coculturing with MS-5
stromal cells
Because interactions between bone marrow stromal cells
and leukemic cells are thought to be responsible for decreased
chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity (35), we investigated
whether NVP-BEZ235 could increase the cytotoxicity of
vincristine in a coculture system. We used the murine stromal
cell line MS-5, which is known to provide long-term support
for primitive hematopoietic progenitors and to mimic the
bone marrow microenvironment (36). Coculture with stromal
cells only slightly decreased the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to
NVP-BEZ235, with the percentage of apoptotic cells decreasing from 15% to 11% (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometric analysis of
CD45+ cells showed that coculture with stromal cells significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the sensitivity to vincristine of
Jurkat cells when compared with cells growing as suspension
cultures, as documented by the percentage of Annexin VFITC–positive cells. However, NVP-BEZ235 restored vincristine sensitivity to the levels measured in suspension cultures
treated with vincristine alone. Nevertheless, the efficacy of
the combined treatment in the presence of stromal cells was
inferior to that detected in suspension cultures (Fig. 4A). This
probably reflects activation of additional survival pathways by
stromal cells. To determine whether the effect of NVP-BEZ235
on Jurkat cells was direct or indirect via an effect on MS-5 signaling or viability, we performed the following experiments.
When PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling was studied by flow cytometry in MS-5 stromal cells cocultured with Jurkat cells, it was
possible to document that NVP-BEZ235 did not affect the
phosphorylation levels of both Ser473 p-Akt and Thr37/46 p4E-BP1 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, either vincristine or NVP-BEZ235
alone did not affect in a statistically significant manner MS-5
cell viability, whereas with the combined treatment, 85% of
stromal cells were still viable (Fig. 4C).
T-ALL lymphoblasts are sensitive to NVP-BEZ235
To better assess the effectiveness of NVP-BEZ235 as a
potential therapeutic agent in T-ALL, we examined seven
pediatric T-ALL patient samples isolated from the bone
marrow or peripheral blood for the levels of PTEN, Ser473
p-Akt, Thr37/46 p-4E-BP1, and Ser235/236 p-S6RP, as well
as for their sensitivity to NVP-BEZ235, using flow cytometric and MTT assays. All of the patients displayed
enhanced phosphorylation of Ser473 p-Akt, Thr37/46 p4E-BP1, and Ser235/236 p-S6RP (not shown). As to PTEN,

8102

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

one patient had very low levels whereas the six others
had higher levels (Fig. 5A). These results were in agreement
with the gene expression profiles (not shown). T-ALL lymphoblast samples were treated with increasing concentrations of NVP-BEZ235, and cell survival was analyzed by
MTT assays. A marked reduction of cell viability at 96 hours
was detected. The IC50 for patient samples ranged between
10 and 50 nmol/L NVP-BEZ235 (Fig. 5B). Flow cytometric
analysis documented a decrease in the levels of p-4E-BP1
and p-S6RP in NVP-BEZ235–treated samples (Fig. 5C).
Interestingly, rapamycin treatment did not result in dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, although it efficiently dephosphorylated S6RP. These results were confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 5C and D). Overall, these findings show that
NVP-BEZ235 has a potent cytotoxic activity also against
primary cells from T-ALL patients with upregulated PI3K/
Akt/mTORC1 signaling.
NVP-BEZ235 targets the SP of T-ALL cell lines and
patient lymphoblasts
Finally, we sought to determine whether NVP-BEZ235
could target the T-ALL SP. This subpopulation, which overexpresses ABCG2 (also referred to as breast cancer resistance protein or BRCP) and other ABC plasma membrane
transporters, is thought to share some properties of cancer
stem cells (CSC; ref. 37). This has been shown in solid
tumors (38, 39) and acute myelogenous leukemia (40). However, candidate CSCs have been successfully identified in
the SP of a murine model of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (41). This suggests that the SP of T-ALL shares some
properties with CSCs. The SP of T-ALL cells was identified
by the live-cell DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342. As a control, Hoechst 33342 staining could be inhibited after incubation with either of the high-specificity ABCG2 transporter
inhibitors fumitremorgin C or KO143. A decrease in the
amount of SP cells was evident in samples treated with
either NVP-BEZ235 or rapamycin for 24 hours (Fig. 6A) in
MOLT-4, CEM-S, and BE-13 cells. Next, we analyzed by flow
cytometry the plasma membrane levels of the most important ABC transporters in the SP of CEM-S cells, which displayed no expression of both P-gp and MRP1 but high levels
of ABCG2 (Fig. 6B).
Both NVP-BEZ235 and rapamycin targeted the SP of lymphoblasts from T-ALL patients (two representative patients are
shown). Expression of ABCG2 on SP cells was documented by
double staining with Hoechst 33342 and an antibody that recognizes an extracellular epitope of the transporter (Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a recently identified potential target for therapeutic intervention in T-ALL. Because
of its complexity and extensive crosstalk with other signaling
cascades, therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR

signaling feedback loops operating through p70S6K and PI3K
(12). Exposure to a dual catalytic PI3K/mTOR inhibitor might
therefore be sufficient to avoid PI3K/Akt pathway reactivation
(22). Moreover, targeting this pathway at multiple levels may
prevent the development of drug resistance (42). In our previ-

reduces the kinase activity of both p110 PI3K and mTORC1/2,
whose efficacy in advanced solid tumors is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials (22). A comparison
between PI-103 and NVP-BEZ235 documented that the latter
compound was significantly more powerful toward T-ALL cells
when used on an equimolar basis. NVP-BEZ235 induced
apoptosis, which led to a cleavage of both procaspase-8 and
procaspase-9, suggesting that both the intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways of apoptosis are activated on exposure to the drug.
Even if downregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is usually
associated with activation of the intrinsic pathway (43),
caspase-8 activation by the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103
has been reported in leukemic cells (44). In breast cancer cells,
NVP-BEZ235 activated caspase-2, which played an important
role in the apoptotic process (45).
Moreover, treatment with NVP-BEZ235 resulted in a
robust accumulation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and

dephosphorylated pRb on Ser807/811, which are two of the
most critical residues for pRb activity in cell cycle progression (46). Consistent with its inhibitory action on both
mTORC1 and mTORC2, NVP-BEZ235 dephosphorylated
p70S6K/4E-BP1/S6RP as well as Akt on Ser473 in T-ALL cells.
Evidence indicates that the modulation of autophagy is an
important component of tumorigenesis, making it a possible
therapeutic target. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is important in inhibiting autophagy (47). We observed that autophagy is activated in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment in
T-ALL cell lines. This observation could be very important,
as some recent studies have documented that tumorigenesis
stimulated by consitutively activated PI3K/Akt signaling is
linked to the ability to inhibit autophagy but not apoptosis,
raising the possibility that autophagy may also be an important mechanism underlying the response to therapeutic
agents targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (47).

Chiarini et al.

Because survival signals generated by cytokines secreted by
cells of the bone marrow microenvironment play an important
role in the emergence of drug resistance, we asked whether
NVP-BEZ235 could diminish these survival signals. Our results
suggest a potential clinical activity of a combination therapy
(NVP-BEZ235 plus vincristine) even in the presence of bone
marrow stromal cells. Remarkably, NVP-BEZ235 displayed a
strong (in the low nanomolar range) cytotoxic activity against
lymphoblasts from patients with pediatric T-ALL characterized by enhanced levels of p-Akt, p-4E-BP1, and p-S6RP. Moreover, it caused the dephosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and
S6RP in these samples, whereas treatment with rapamycin
did not induce 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation. Therefore, as reported for acute myelogenous leukemia cells (16), agents that
target mTORC1 activities globally could be more beneficial
than rapamycin/rapalogues for T-ALL patients (16).
The difficulty in eradicating tumors might result from the
conventional treatments targeting the bulk of the tumor
cells, but not the CSCs. Therefore, strategies that eliminate
these cells could have significant clinical implications. We
have shown that both NVP-BEZ235 and rapamycin markedly
reduced the T-ALL SP, which might correspond, at least in
part, to CSCs. It is still unclear whether NVP-BEZ235 was
directly cytotoxic to the SP cells or it simply blocked ABCG2
activity (and thus Hoechst dye extrusion), as it has been
previously documented that membrane localization of ABCG2
in mouse bone marrow cells was dependent on Akt activity
(48). However, NVP-BEZ235 targeted the SP of BE-13 cells
that do not display Akt activation. Moreover, rapamycin also
strongly reduced the SP of T-ALL, and our previous results

indicated that rapamycin was not as effective as PI-103 in
reducing p-Akt levels in T-ALL cells (20).
These observations suggest that NVP-BEZ235 could be
directly cytotoxic to the SP cells due to inhibition of mTORC1
activity. Indeed, the key role played by mTORC1 signaling in
the survival of leukemic stem cells in mouse models of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia is now beginning to emerge (49, 50).
However, additional experiments are required to further
address this issue.
Taken together, our preclinical findings strongly suggest
that NVP-BEZ235, either alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, could be a valuable compound in the treatment of those T-ALL patients displaying
activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and who still face a
poor prognosis.
