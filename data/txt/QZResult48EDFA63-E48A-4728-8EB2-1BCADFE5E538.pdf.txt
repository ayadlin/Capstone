Abstract
Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) are key regulators of apoptosis and are inhibited by the second
mitocondrial activator of caspases (SMAC). Previously, a small subset of TNF-a–expressing non–small cell lung
cancers (NSCLC) was found to be sensitive to SMAC mimetics alone. In this study, we determined if a SMAC
mimetic (JP1201) could sensitize nonresponsive NSCLC cell lines to standard chemotherapy. We found that
JP1201 sensitized NSCLCs to doxorubicin, erlotinib, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and the combination of
carboplatin with paclitaxel in a synergistic manner at clinically achievable drug concentrations. Sensitization did
not occur with platinum alone. Furthermore, sensitization was speciﬁc for tumor compared with normal lung
epithelial cells, increased in NSCLCs harvested after chemotherapy treatment, and did not induce TNF-a
secretion. Sensitization also was enhanced in vivo with increased tumor inhibition and increased survival of mice
carrying xenografts. These effects were accompanied by caspase 3, 4, and 9 activation, indicating that both
mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptotic pathways are activated by the combination
of vinorelbine and JP1201. Chemotherapies that induce cell death through the mitochondrial pathway required
only inhibition of X-linked IAP (XIAP) for sensitization, whereas chemotherapies that induce cell death through
multiple apoptotic pathways required inhibition of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP. Therefore, the data suggest that IAPtargeted therapy using a SMAC mimetic provides a new therapeutic strategy for synergistic sensitization of
NSCLCs to standard chemotherapy agents, which seems to occur independently of TNF-a secretion. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of all
lung cancers, has a poor prognosis, and often is clinically
resistant to chemotherapy (1). Although therapy targeted at
"oncogene addiction," such as mutant epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) or ALK fusion proteins, is an important
approach, ways to improve tumor response to existing chemotherapies without affecting normal cells would be a major
step forward.

Cancer cells avoid apoptosis by upregulation of antiapoptotic factors such as the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP),
which bind caspases and sequester them or inhibit their
protease activity (2). The human IAP family contains 8 proteins, most notably cIAP1, cIAP2, and X-chromosome–
encoded IAP (XIAP). XIAP is the only IAP known to actively
inhibit caspase activity (3). cIAP1 and cIAP2 were identiﬁed for
their ability to interact with TRAF1 and TRAF2, localizing the
cIAPs to the TNF receptor (TNFR; ref. 4). The recruitment of
cIAP1 and cIAP2 to TNFR1 inhibits TNF-a–dependent, RIPK1dependent activation of caspase 8 (4–9).
Currently, there are 3 known apoptotic pathways, the intrinsic or mitochondrial, the extrinsic or death receptor, and the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced pathway (10).
These pathways differ by the upstream signals that activate
them and the initiator caspase involved: caspase 9 in the
mitochondrial pathway, caspase 8 or 10 in the death receptor
pathway, and caspase 4 in the ER stress pathway (11).
Our previous work aimed to develop second mitochondrial
activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetics to target cancer cell–
speciﬁc alterations (6, 9, 12, 13). We hypothesized that inhibition
of IAPs by a SMAC mimetic would prime NSCLCs to respond to
apoptogenic chemotherapies. In the current work using an
oncogenotype diverse panel of NSCLC cell lines resistant to
single-agent SMAC mimetic (JP1201), we found JP1201 can

SMAC Sensitizes NSCLC to Multiple Treatments

sensitize tumor cells to several standard chemotherapy agents
and erlotinib in in vitro studies. In xenograft models of NSCLC,
we found the combination of JP1201 with gemcitabine or
vinorelbine reduces in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent
than the sum of each agent alone. The JP1201-induced sensitization showed speciﬁcity for tumor over normal epithelial
cells, and was independent of TNF-a production, but dependent on 2 other apoptotic programs. Thus, SMAC mimetics are
potent sensitizers of NSCLC to conventional chemotherapy and
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–targeted therapy and
their IAP targets differ between chemotherapy regimens.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
With the exception of A549 [from the American Type Culture
Collection, (ATCC)], all tumor cell lines were established in our
laboratories (A.F. Gazdar and J.D. Minna) and are deposited at
the ATCC (14, 15). Cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640
medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS.
Immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were
established by ectopically expressing CDK4 and hTERT, denoted
by KT at the end of the cell line name, and were grown in
Keratinocyte Serum-Free Medium (KSFM) supplemented with
bovine pituitary extract and recombinant human EGF (Gibco;
ref. 16). Deﬁned oncogenic changes, Kras G12V and p53 short
hairpin RNA, were introduced in HBEC3KT and tumorigenic
clones (clone 1, clone 5) isolated by soft agar formation, which
were further cultured in RPMI-1640 with 5% FBS (17). All cell
lines were grown in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2, at
37 C have been DNA ﬁngerprinted for provenance using the
PowerPlex 1.2 kit (Promega) and conﬁrmed to be the same as the
DNA ﬁngerprint library maintained by ATCC and the Minna/
Gazdar lab (the primary source of the lines), and were conﬁrmed
to be free of mycoplasma by the e-Myco kit (Boca Scientiﬁc).

NCI-H1395 or NCI-H157 cells (1  106 in 100 mL) were injected
s.c. on the left ﬂank. Animals were monitored 3 times a week
and tumors measured with digital calipers. Tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula (D  d2  0.52), where D is
the largest diameter and d is the shortest (18). At sacriﬁce,
tumors were harvested and ﬁxed in formalin. Treatment
groups (8 mice per group) consisted of saline, 25 mg/kg
gemcitabine, 2.4 mg/kg vinorelbine, 6 mg/kg JP1201, 6 mg/kg
JP1201 þ 25 mg/kg gemcitabine, or 6 mg/kg JP1201 þ
2.4 mg/kg vinorelbine; each injection was given in a volume
of 100 mL administered intraperitoneally (12, 19). Saline, gemcitabine, and JP1201 were given 3 times a week, and vinorelbine
was given twice a week to minimize toxicity (19).
siRNA-mediated MTS assay
siRNA transfections were done as a reverse transfection with
25 nmol/L as the ﬁnal siRNA concentration at a 1:2 lipid to oligo
ratio (12). RNA-lipid complexes were allowed to form during a
20- to 30-minute incubation. Then 8,000 cells were added to
each well in RPMI with 5% FBS, total volume per well 50 mL.
Drugs were administered 24 hours after transfection as
described above.
Quantitative PCR analysis of siRNA knockdown
efﬁciency
Transfections were done as described above, except that
RNA-lipid complexes were formed in 6-well plates in a volume
of 1 mL for a 20-minute incubation period, and cells were
plated at 70% conﬂuency. Twenty-four hours later, cells were
harvested and total RNA prepared (RNeasy Plus Mini Kit,
Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNA using
the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). Gene-speciﬁc TaqMan
probes (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantitate GAPDH,
cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, Caspase 3, 4, 8, and 9, RIPK1, TNFR1, and
TNF-a levels in biologica duplicates and duplicate samples of
siRNA transfected H1395 cells. The 2DDCT method was used to
calculate relative expression levels (20).

MTS assay
Assays were done as described (12). Chemotherapies were
given as 4-fold dilutions with a maximum dose of 1,000 nmol/L
for paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and vinorelbine (Pierre
Fabre Company), 2,000 nmol/L for gemcitabine (Eli Lilly and
Company) and doxorubicin (Teva Parenteral), or 100 mmol/L
for erlotinib (OSI Pharmaceuticals), cisplatin (Teva Parenteral), or JP1201 (Joyant Pharmaceuticials) alone. A dose of 10
mmol/L or 100 nmol/L of JP1201 was used in combination
assays as indicated. Each experiment contained 8 replicates
per concentration, and the entire assay was done in multiple
replicates (n  4). Drug sensitivity curves and IC50s were
calculated using in-house software (DIVISA).

Microscopy
Formalin-ﬁxed tissues were embedded in parafﬁn, cut in
10-mm sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was done per manufacturer instructions
(Promega) on parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections from 3 tumors
per treatment group with data averaged from 3 images per slide,
3 slides per treatment group. Images of stained slides were taken
using an Eclipse TE2000 epiﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon).
ImageJ (NIH) software was used to produce overlaid images of
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and antibody staining.

Mouse xenograft treatment studies
Mouse work followed an International Animal Care and
Usage Committee–approved protocol. NCI-H1395 and NCIH157 cells were trypsinized, washed, and counted using trypan
blue exclusion to assess viability. Cell suspensions with viability greater than 95% were used in animal studies. Subcutaneous tumors were established in nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice as described (6, 12). Brieﬂy,

Luciferase reporter assay
Pathway analysis was done using the Stress and Toxicity
Cignal Finder 10 pathway reporter array (SA Biosciences)
following the manufacturer's instructions. Sixteen hours after
cells were reverse transfected, they were treated with 1 mmol/L
vinorelbine with 10 mmol/L JP1201 or 10 mmol/L JP1201 as
control, then incubated for an additional 24 hours. Luciferase
activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay system

(Promega) on a FLUOstar omega (BMG Biotech). Fireﬂy luciferase was the experimental reporter, and Renilla luciferase was
the normalizing reporter; samples were further normalized to
nontransfected control cells.
Statistics
Combination indices (CI) for the drug sensitivity data were
calculated using the Chou–Talay method (21). SDs were calculated based on drug sensitivity data. Data from the xenograft
studies were analyzed using GraphPad software (GraphPad
Prism version 5.02, www.graphpad.com). Results are expressed
as mean  SEM. Data were analyzed by t test or ANOVA and
results are considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
SMAC mimetic synergizes with conventional
chemotherapy in NSCLC cell lines in vitro
An agent with minimal side effects that speciﬁcally sensitizes
tumor cells to standard available chemotherapies would provide an important new therapeutic approach. SMAC mimetics
could be such an agent, and thus we evaluated the ability of the
SMAC mimetic, JP1201, to sensitize NSCLCs to chemotherapies
that have been used to treat NSCLC in the clinic. Using a panel of
16 NSCLC cell lines resistant to JP1201 monotherapy, 2 immor-

talized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), and 2 genetically modiﬁed malignant HBEC lines, we examined the effects
of combinations of 10 mmol/L JP1201 with single-agent cisplatin,
doxorubicin, erlotinib, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine,
and the combination of paclitaxel with carboplatin and found
JP1201 induced sensitization in most cases (Table 1, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; refs. 1–3). All but one NSCLC line were
sensitized to the combination of JP1201 þ vinorelbine, whereas
almost no cell lines were sensitized to the combination of
JP1201 þ cisplatin. In addition, the pattern of response across
the NSCLC panel was unique for each drug combination. Of
importance, 3 NSCLCs with wild-type EGFR were sensitized
to the EGFR TKI, erlotinib. CIs were calculated and revealed
that most combinations resulted in synergy (Supplementary
Table S3; ref. 4). Furthermore, we conﬁrmed the range of
sensitization seen in mass culture MTS assays with similar
results in colony formation assays (Supplementary Table S4).
Thus, we found JP1201 showed synergistic sensitization to
available chemotherapy agents and EGFR TKI-targeted therapy.
JP1201 exhibits great selectivity in chemotherapy
sensitization in isogenic cell line pairs
Included in this panel are several types of isogenic cell
line pairs: a tumor/normal lung epithelial cell pair, HCC4017,
and HBEC30KT established from the same patient;

SMAC Sensitizes NSCLC to Multiple Treatments

Combination of SMAC mimetic (JP1201) and
chemotherapy control NSCLC xenograft growth
To determine in vivo efﬁcacy, we used s.c. NCI-H1395
xenografts to examine the effects of JP1201 in combination
with gemcitabine or vinorelbine. Tumors in mice treated with
saline, gemcitabine, or JP1201 alone continued to grow exponentially during the 3-week treatment period. Tumor growth
was partially controlled by vinorelbine, and well controlled in
the JP1201 with gemcitabine (JP þ Gem) and JP1201 with
vinorelbine (JP þ Vin)-treated groups (Fig. 2A). Tumors from
the JP þ Vin group showed a 70% decrease in tumor burden as
compared with the vinorelbine group. Similarly, tumors from
the JP þ Gem group showed a 60% decrease in tumor burden as
compared with the tumors treated with gemcitabine (Fig. 2B).
Induction of apoptosis was explored using TUNEL assays and
revealed a signiﬁcant increase in TUNEL staining in the JP þ
Gem and JP þ Vin groups compared with single agent and
vehicle-treated tumors (Fig. 2C). In the very aggressive NCIH157 NSCLC xenograft model, we saw an increase in survival
time with treatment of JP þ Vin compared with JP1201,
vinorelbine, or control (Fig. 3). Thus, combination therapy was
effective in vivo.
Chemotherapy agents require targeting of different IAPs
for sensitization
To determine which IAPs are involved in the sensitization to
each chemotherapy, siRNAs targeting cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP
were used in place of JP1201 treatment in combination with
gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and paclitaxel in 4 NSCLC lines (NCIH1395, NCI-H358, NCI-H2887, and NCI-H1819) and knockdowns
were validated by quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S2, Supplementary Table S5). Knockdown of XIAP alone
mimics JP1201 treatment with gemcitabine, whereas knockdown of either cIAP1 or cIAP2 had no effect (Fig. 4B). By contrast,
knockdown of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP increasingly sensitized

where deﬁned oncogenic changes, Kras G12V and p53

clone 5) isolated by soft agar formation; and 2 sets of tumor
lines that were each established from the same patient.
These pairs were isolated before and after treatment of the
same patients with cisplatin and etoposide: NCI-H1693
(before) and NCI-H1819 (after); NCI-H1993 (before) and
NCI-H2073 (after; refs. 1–3). JP1201 sensitizes HCC4017 but
not HBEC30KT to chemotherapy (Fig. 1A, Table 1).
HBEC3KT tumorigenic clones 1 and 5 are sensitized 10- to
20-fold to vinorelbine (20-fold) or paclitaxel (12–15-fold),
whereas the parental HBEC3KT cells are not sensitized to
chemotherapy (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Surprisingly, H1819 and
H2073, which were started from residual NSCLC cells harvested after neoadjuvant platinum and etoposide chemotherapy, were sensitized approximately 200-fold greater to
chemotherapy than H1693 and H1993, which were started
from NSCLC samples from each respective patient prior to
treatment (Table 1). Thus, we found speciﬁcity of JP1201
sensitization for tumor compared with normal cells and
even in tumor cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

the cells to paclitaxel and vinorelbine (Fig. 4C and D). We
conclude that different classes of chemotherapy require inhibition of different sets of IAPs for sensitization, and in general
these targets are similar among different NSCLCs.
TNF-a signaling is not required for sensitization to
chemotherapy by JP1201
Autocrine TNF-a secretion is a strong predictor of
sensitivity to JP1201 as a single agent in a subset of NSCLCs
(6–8). Thus, we explored whether the mechanism of sensitization involved the induction of TNF-a after chemotherapy treatment in 8 NSCLC lines. No TNF-a secretion
was found under any conditions tested (Supplementary Fig.
S3). When we added recombinant TNF-a to the media (10
pg/mL) no sensitization to gemcitabine or vinorelbine was
seen. Finally, the combination of TNF-a with gemcitabine
or vinorelbine in the presence of XIAP knockdown showed

RIPK1, or TNFR1 did not protect the cells from JP þ Vin,
whereas the knockdown of caspase 3 offered some protection against JP þ Vin (Fig. 5A). These results suggest the
effects of JP þ Vin are dependent on an apoptotic pathway
different from the TNF-a–RIPK1 pathway, indicating
JP1201 sensitization to standard chemotherapies occurs
by a TNF-a–independent mechanism.
ER stress–induced apoptosis mediated through caspase 4
as mechanism for JP1201 þ chemotherapy sensitization
To better understand how NSCLCs are sensitized to the
combination of JP1201 with vinorelbine, we used the Stress and
Toxicity Cignal Finder 10-pathway reporter array. HCC4017,
HBEC30KT, H1395, and H157 were reverse transfected with a
set of pathway-speciﬁc reporter constructs, and cells were
treated with JP1201 or the combination of JP1201 þ vinorelbine
for 24 hours after transfection. The activity of the indicated
pathway was determined by ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity relative to
control Renilla luciferase activity (Table 2). Only the ER stress
pathway was activated by combination therapy in all 3 NSCLC
lines but not in normal cells (Table 2). Caspase 4 is the putative
initiator caspase for the ER stress–induced apoptotic pathway
(8, 9). Knockdown of caspase 4 protects H1395 cells against

time, similar to an agent known to activate the ER stress
pathway, thapsigargan (Supplementary Fig. S4). We conclude
that JP1201 sensitizes NSCLCs to multiple chemotherapy
agents, and this sensitization is not dependent on TNF-a
signaling but is dependent on ER stress and mitochondrialinduced apoptotic pathways.

Discussion
Evaluation of the apoptotic machinery in tumors has led to
the development of therapeutic agents targeting this machinery, including SMAC mimetics (13, 22–27). We addressed the
utility of SMAC mimetic JP1201 in NSCLCs that do not express
TNF-a and are resistant to SMAC mimetic monotherapy. In a
panel of NSCLC lines of various histotypes and oncogenotypes,
JP1201 frequently synergized with available chemotherapy
agents, with considerable intertumor heterogeneity in NSCLC
responses between drug combinations. In NSCLC xenografts,

NOTE: Left,the combination of JP1201 þ vinorelbine selectively activates the ER stress pathway. H1395 cells were reverse transfected
with ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter constructs that contain response elements for the indicated pathways and control Renilla luciferase
constructs, then treated with 10 mmol/L JP1201, 1 mmol/L gemcitabine, 1 mmol/L vinorelbine, or JP1201 þ vinorelbine for 24 hours;
luciferase activity was assayed, and ﬁreﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for each sample and
normalized to untransfected cells. Right, ER stress pathway is activated by the combination of vinorelbine þ JP1201. H1395, H157,
HCC4017, and HBEC30KT cells were reverse transfected with the indicated ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter construct, treated with JP1201 þ
vinorelbine. Fireﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase for each sample, and to JP1201-treated cells.

where JP1201 alone had little effect on tumor growth, the
combination of vinorelbine or gemcitabine with JP1201
decreased tumor growth, which translated to an increase in
survival of these mice. The frequent occurrence of synergy
(particularly with paclitaxel and vinorelbine) suggests potential for JP1201 or similar drugs as a part of combination
chemotherapy for NSCLC. This agrees with the ﬁndings of
Dean and colleagues (28), who studied 2 NSCLC lines and
found synergy with vinorelbine in combination with a different
IAP antagonist that targeted XIAP.
JP1201 sensitized many NSCLC lines to concentrations of
vinorelbine (10–15 nmol/L) and paclitaxel (100 nmol/L) that
are achievable in humans as steady-state plasma levels (Supplementary Table S2; refs. 29, 30). Also, 3 NSCLC lines, all wild
type for EGFR, were sensitized to the EGFR TKI, erlotinib, at
clinically achievable concentrations (31). Studying a large panel
of NSCLC lines, including the 2 investigated by Dean and
colleagues, we found no synergy with JP1201 þ cisplatin, whereas Dean and colleagues, using the BIR2-binding XIAP antagonist
XAC 1296-11, saw synergy with cisplatin (28). The reason for this
discrepancy is not yet understood but suggests mechanistic
speciﬁcity of the different SMAC mimetics. The lack of sensitization to cisplatin seen in this study correlates with p53
mutational status, indicating that p53 mutations may prevent
cisplatin-induced apoptotic signaling (Supplementary Table S7).
Our panel includes 3 types of genetically paired cell lines,
NSCLC lines started before (H1693 and H1993) and after

7646

etoposide/cisplatin treatment (H1819 and H2073); an isogenic
HBEC3KT-based system where oncogenic Kras and knockdown of p53 were introduced and tumorigenic clones were
isolated from soft agar clones; and a tumor (HCC4017) and
normal HBEC pair. Using these, we found sensitization by
JP1201 to chemotherapy is speciﬁc for the malignant phenotype, and NSCLC lines derived from samples after chemotherapy could be sensitized to chemotherapy more than NSCLCs
that were chemo-na€ve. Thus, SMAC mimetic-based combinations with chemotherapy may be effective in tumor cells
resistant to chemotherapy alone.
XIAP is the only IAP with the ability to inhibit the enzymatic
activity of an active caspase (3). Thus, it was reasonable to
predict that stimulation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis
would only require the inhibition of XIAP for apoptosis to
occur (2), as was found in pancreatic cancer cell lines treated
with JP1201 þ gemcitabine (12). When we combined siRNA
against cIAP1, cIAP2, or XIAP with gemcitabine, we saw that
the knockdown of XIAP mimics the combination of JP1201 þ
gemcitabine. By contrast, we found knockdown of each cIAP1,
cIAP2, or XIAP mimics to different degrees the effect seen when
JP1201 is combined with paclitaxel or vinorelbine, suggesting
unique roles for each IAP in sensitizing NSCLCs to
antimitotics.
Inhibition of tubulin dynamics, for example with vinorelbine,
can inhibit ER to golgi transport, a trigger for ER stress-induced
apoptosis (10, 32). Analysis of pathways activated by the

SMAC Sensitizes NSCLC to Multiple Treatments

combination of JP1201 þ vinorelbine in multiple cell lines
revealed that the ER stress pathway is activated. Furthermore,
Western blotting and siRNA-mediated rescue experiments also
showed that caspase 4, the putative ER stress-induced caspase,
is activated after vinorelbine treatment, and knockdown of
capsase 4 was better at protecting NSCLCs from treatment of
JP1201 þ vinorelbine than was knockdown of the executioner
caspase, caspase 3. There are reports that suggest cIAP1 is
involved in a complex at the ER membrane that is responsible
for activating apoptosis; however, further studies are needed to
characterize the role of the ER stress pathway in sensitizing
NSCLCs to chemotherapy by SMAC mimetics (11, 33, 34).
We found that JP1201-resistant NSCLC lines do not induce
or secrete TNF-a after chemotherapy, indicating the synergy
seen between doxorubicin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or vinorelbine with JP1201 is TNF-a independent. Studies adding
recombinant TNF-a with gemcitabine or vinorelbine also
suggest that TNF-a is not involved in the JP1201-induced
sensitization to chemotherapy. This is further strengthened
by the lack of additional sensitization when the combination of
TNF-a and gemcitabine or vinorelbine is given to cells where
XIAP expression has been knocked down. The lack of protection of combinations of JP1201 þ vinorelbine by the knockdown of caspase 8, RIPK1, or TNFR1 further suggests JP1201 is
promoting apoptosis in a TNF-a–independent fashion (6–8).
In conclusion, we ﬁnd that a SMAC mimetic signiﬁcantly
sensitizes NSCLC lines to chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted

therapy; the sensitization varies between NSCLCs and
between chemotherapeutic agents; the sensitization is
tumor speciﬁc and is stronger in NSCLCs that have progressed after neoadjuvant therapy; the required IAP target to
be inhibited varied between chemotherapeutic agents; and
the sensitization seemed to be TNF-a independent, but
dependent on 2 complementary apoptotic pathways, mitochondrial and ER stress. These data strongly suggest the
need to explore SMAC mimetics in combination with standard doublet chemotherapy as a new treatment approach
for NSCLC patients.
