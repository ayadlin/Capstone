ABSTRACT
According to the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, the aggressive growth and
early metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is due to the activity of
CSCs, which are not targeted by current therapies. Otto Warburg suggested that the
growth of cancer cells is driven by a high glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated
whether glycolysis inhibition targets CSCs and thus may enhance therapeutic efficacy.
Four established and 3 primary PDA cell lines, non-malignant cells, and 3 patienttumor-derived CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures were analyzed by glucose turnover
measurements, MTT and ATP assays, flow cytometry of ALDH1 activity and annexin
positivity, colony and spheroid formation, western blotting, electrophoretic mobility
shift assay, xenotransplantation, and immunohistochemistry. The effect of siRNAmediated inhibition of LDH-A and LDH-B was also investigated. The PDA cells exhibited
a high glucose metabolism, and glucose withdrawal or LDH inhibition by siRNA
prevented growth and colony formation. Treatment with the anti-glycolytic agent
3-bromopyruvate almost completely blocked cell viability, self-renewal potential,
NF-κB binding activity, and stem cell-related signaling and reverted gemcitabine
resistance. 3-bromopyruvate was less effective in weakly malignant PDA cells and
did not affect non-malignant cells, predicting minimal side effects. 3-bromopyruvate
inhibited in vivo tumor engraftment and growth on chicken eggs and mice and
enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine by influencing the expression of markers of
proliferation, apoptosis, self-renewal, and metastasis. Most importantly, primary CSCenriched spheroidal cultures were eliminated by 3-bromopyruvate. These findings
propose that CSCs may be specifically dependent on a high glucose turnover and
suggest 3-bromopyruvate for therapeutic intervention.

INTRODUCTION

3BrP acts as an alkylating agent, which enhances tumor
cell death [18]. The anti-tumor effects of 3BrP have been
demonstrated in PDA cell lines in vitro, in subcutaneous
xenografts [19], and in orthotopically transplanted mouse
xenografts [20]. Recently, 3BrP was first tested in a case
study at University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, on a
16-year-old patient with advanced metabolically active
fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma [21]; unsuccessful
therapeutic intervention with chemotherapy and sorafenib
had been first applied. The conclusions were that tumor
necrosis was more extensive than after the application
of known cytostatic drugs, liver regeneration was not
inhibited, and the patient was able to survive longer than
expected with an improved quality of life [21]. These data
point to the possibility that 3BrP targets CSCs, which are
made responsible for aggressive growth.
In the present study we analyzed, whether 3BrP
targets pancreatic CSC features and sensitizes therapyresistant PDA cells to gemcitabine. Through the use of a
broad panel of established and primary PDA cells and in
vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that 3BrP targets
the CSC self-renewal potential and inhibits several stem
cell-related factors. Our data suggest that 3BrP efficiently
eliminates highly aggressive PDA cells and, together with
gemcitabine, leads to complete tumor elimination with low
side effects.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one
of the most aggressive malignancies and is typically
diagnosed in an advanced state, with extensive local
invasion, early systemic dissemination, and marked
resistance to chemo- and radiotherapies [1]. Despite the
low response rate to current treatment options and the
modest overall survival benefit and rapid development of
resistance, gemcitabine has been adopted as the standard
therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [2]. However,
neither gemcitabine nor other chemotherapies, such as
FOLFIRINOX, directly target the pathways responsible
for the aggressive growth, early metastasis, and therapy
resistance of PDA.
Markers for cancer stem cells (CSCs), including
c-Met, CD133, CD44, CxCR4, ALDH1, and Sox2, have
been identified in PDA and are thought to be responsible
for the aggressive growth, early metastasis, high resistance
to therapy, and frequent relapse despite surgery and
chemotherapy [3-6]. CSCs exhibit the properties of normal
stem cells, such as chemotherapy resistance, high DNA
repair capacity, apoptosis resistance, and self-renewal
potential, with the latter being characterized by the ability
to form spheroids and colonies and to recapitulate a tumor
after xenotransplantation. In addition, increased activity
of the transcription factor NF-κB contributes to the
aggressive nature of pancreatic CSCs [7].
Nearly 100 years ago, Otto Warburg described the
enhanced glucose metabolism and production of lactate by
cancer cells under aerobic conditions, with mitochondrial
energy recovery being strongly inhibited [8]. Metabolic
reactions in the glycolytic pathway are catalyzed by
such enzymes as hexokinase II (HKII), glycerinaldehyd3-phosphat-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), and data from proteomic analyses
demonstrate the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes
in pancreatic cancer [9]. Today, positron emission
tomography (PET) utilizes Warburg’s findings to detect
tumors based on the accumulation of fluorescence-marked
glucose. A higher PET signal correlates to an advanced
tumor stage, and experimental studies demonstrate that
increased glucose uptake and lactate production occur
particularly in late tumorigenesis [10-13]. Because
CSCs are enriched after several treatment cycles and in
metastasis during late tumorigenesis [6, 14], these data
propose that CSCs may be specifically dependent on a
high glucose turnover; nonetheless, this assumption has
not been investigated to date.
The cancer cell-specific glycolysis inhibitor
3-bromopyruvate (3BrP), a halogenated analog of
pyruvate [15], inhibits HKII [16] and GAPDH [17] and
mitochondrial ATP production [16], which leads to the
depletion of ATP resources within minutes, particularly
in cells with mitochondrial DNA deletion and respiration
defects, and induces massive cell death [18]. In addition,

RESULTS
Survival of PDA cells with CSC features depends
on glucose turnover
To examine whether pancreatic CSCs are dependent
on glycolysis (schematic of glycolysis Fig. 1A), we
examined 4 human established PDA cell lines with high
or low CSC features (see Fig. S1). A western blot analysis
under regular culture conditions with 25 mmol/L glucose
revealed that the MIA-PaCa2 and AsPC1 cells expressed
high levels of the CSC-marker aldehyde dehydrogenase
isoform 1 (ALDH1), whereas the BxPc-3 and Capan-2
cells did not (Fig. 1B). ALDH1 expression correlated to the
amount of CSC features, such as the p53 and K-ras status,
in vitro morphology, self-renewal capacity, gemcitabine
resistance, and expression of E-cadherin and vimentin
(Fig. S1). Similarly, the glycolytic enzymes LDH-A and
LDH-B were highly expressed in the two more aggressive
cell lines but to a lower extend in the two less aggressive
cell lines, whereas the amount of GLUT-1 expression
could not be correlated to the level of CSC features. The
culture for 3 days in a medium with a minimal amount
of glucose (0.15 mmol/L) was accompanied by a total
absence of glucose consumption and lactate production
(Fig. 1C). As expected, glucose consumption and lactate
production under culture conditions in the presence of

glucose were generally lower in non-malignant stellate
cells and fibroblasts. However, no obvious difference in
glucose turnover was observed between the highly and
low aggressive PDA cell lines. In contrast, morphological
studies after three weeks of culture in a medium with a
minimal amount of glucose (0.15 mmol/L) revealed that
most of the highly aggressive MIA-PaCa2 and AsPC1 cells were dead, whereas most of the less aggressive
BxPC-3 and Capan-2 cells survived (Fig. 1D). Similarly,
colonies, which are formed by the highly aggressive and
CSC-like cells only (Fig. S1), were significantly reduced
upon deprivation of glucose to a minimal amount (0.15
mmol/L) in all cell lines (Fig. 1D, Fig. S2A). To further
elucidate the function of glucose metabolism in colony
formation, we knocked down LDH-A in MIA-PaCa2
and BxPc-3 cells using three different LDH-A-targeting
siRNAs. Compared to the non-specific control siRNA,
two of the LDH-A siRNAs completely downregulated
LDH-A protein expression at a concentration of 50 pmol,
and the strongest effect, as evaluated by western blotting,
was observed at five days after transfection (Fig. 1E). The
inhibition of the LDH-A protein was accompanied by the
inhibition of colony formation (Fig. 1F). Likewise, the
siRNA-mediated downregulation of LDH-B (Fig. 1G)
strongly inhibited colony formation (Fig. 1H), suggesting
that both isoforms of LDH are required for survival of
CSCs.

Because a therapeutic approach using siRNA is
far from clinical application for therapeutic inhibition
of LDH, we elucidated the influence of 3BrP on CSC
features. This agent is inexpensive and commercially
available and has already demonstrated promising results
in a patient case study [21]. Cells were treated with 3BrP
at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 µM, and cell
viability was examined 24 h later with the MTT assay,
which measures the NAD(P)H content [22]. Starting at a
dose of 25 µM, 3BrP dose-dependently inhibited viability,
with the strongest effects observed in the more aggressive
MIA-PaCa2 and PANC-1 cells, whereas the less
aggressive BxPc-3 cells were minor affected; no influence
at all was observed in the non-malignant CRL 4023 cells
(Fig. 2A). These results were due to the specific inhibition
of glucose turnover by 3BrP, as competition with the
analogs lactate or pyruvate for 24 h and subsequent
treatment with 50 µM 3BrP for another 24 h counteracted
the 3BrP-induced reduction in viability (Fig. 2B). After
pre-treatment of the cells with 3BrP for 24 h, followed by
treatment with gemcitabine for an additional 72 h alone
or in combination, we found that 3BrP strongly inhibited
viability in the three cancer cell lines but not in the nonmalignant CRL 4023 cells, as detected by the MTT assay

groups. The tumor xenografts were resected at day 17, and the tumor volume was measured as described in M&M. The significance

resistant. We then used primary human PDA cell lines to
evaluate the effects in additional patient-related primary
PDA models. Treatment with 3BrP and gemcitabine
alone or in combination revealed that PaCa DD 183 is
gemcitabine resistant, PaCa DD 159 is slightly responsive
to gemcitabine, and PaCa DD 135 is gemcitabine sensitive
(Fig. 2C). In accordance with our results in established
PDA cell lines, the gemcitabine-resistant PaCa DD 183
cells were most sensitive to 3BrP in comparison to PaCa
DD 159 and PaCa DD 135 cells, which were responsive
to 3BrP though to a minor extent. We also tried the
combination of 3BrP with 2 other metabolic inhibitors
and used the glycolysis inhibitor 2-desoxy-d-glucose
(2-DG) and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (B).
Each agent significantly inhibited the viability, but the
combination with 3BrP was superior (Fig. 2D). Likewise,
2-DG significantly increased the efficacy of gemcitabine
(Fig. S2 D), suggesting that inhibition of glycolysis in
general enhances the anti-tumor activity. Together, 3BrP
largely appears to influence more advanced PDA cells,
it overcomes gemcitabine resistance and enhances the
therapeutic efficacy of other metabolic inhibitors.

nearly abolished colony formation entirely (Fig. 3A). To
evaluate whether a few CSCs might have resisted the
treatment and thus may be capable of mediating tumor
relapse, we examined the potential of second-generation
colony formation. Cells were seeded at clonal density and,
after colony formation, the cells were treated. At 72 hours
after gemcitabine treatment, the cells were trypsinized
and re-seeded at clonal density for a second round of
treatment under identical conditions. This resulted in an
even stronger prevention of colony formation in both
single treatments, whereas 3BrP was more effective than
gemcitabine (Fig. 3B). Most importantly, the combination
of both agents totally prevented colony formation.
Similarly, treatment of spheroidal-growing cells led to
a reduction in spheroid sizes: 3BrP was stronger than
gemcitabine, and both agents together had an additive
effect (Fig. 3C). Repeated treatment of the re-seeded
spheroidal growing cells completely prevented the
formation of secondary spheroids (Fig. 3D). The observed
effects on the self-renewal potential were confirmed by
the measurement of the ALDH1 activity in MIA-PaCa2
cells using the ALDEFLUOR assay and FACS analysis,
and 3BrP and the combined treatment, but not gemcitabine
alone, completely inhibited ALDH1 activity (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, the PANC-1 cells already had a basal low ALDH1
activity, which was not further significantly reduced by
treatment. However, 3BrP induced stronger apoptosis
than gemcitabine, and the combination of both agents
further increased the induction of apoptosis in both cell
lines, as measured by annexin staining and FACS analysis
(Fig. 4B). To examine the influence of 3BrP on stem cell

signaling, protein expression was analyzed by western
blotting. 3BrP, but not gemcitabine, strongly diminished
the expression of ALDH1, Notch1, Oct-4, and Sox2 in
both cell lines (Fig. 4C), though the combination therapy
had no stronger effect than 3BrP alone. To examine NFκB activity, we investigated the binding activity of nuclear
proteins to the NF-κB consensus-binding site by EMSA.
Although 3BrP reduced the binding activity of NF-κB
complexes, gemcitabine induced this activity (Fig. 4D).
The combination of both agents had no stronger effect
than 3BrP alone in MIA-PaCa2 cells, yet it completely
abolished NF-κB activity in PANC-1 cells.

by xenotransplantation to the CAM of fertilized chicken
eggs. 3BrP reduced the engraftment to 57% compared
to 65% in the control group, whereas gemcitabine had
no obvious effect, with a rate of 63%. However, the
combined treatment totally blocked the engraftment of
tumors, suggesting that all CSCs were eliminated (Fig.
5A). Examination of the resected tumors revealed that the
volume was strongly reduced in the 3BrP-treated group;
gemcitabine was less effective, and the combination
treatment completely prevented tumor growth. In a second
experiment, we transplanted untreated PANC-1 cells and
treated the xenografts in ovo [21]. The results confirm the
data above (Fig. 5B). These results were underlined by
double-immunofluorescence staining of the resected tumor
tissue for the proliferation marker Ki67 and a marker of
human cells, cytokeratin 19. The expression of these
markers was strongly reduced after single treatments,
with the most pronounced effects in the 3BrP-treated

groups (Fig. 5C). The single or combination treatment
was non-toxic in vivo as concluded from H&E staining
of embryonal liver, where no necrosis was detected (Fig.
5D). Likewise, the embryos of either group looked normal
and had a comparable body weight (Fig. 5E). The tumor
tissue derived from the PANC-1 xenografts was further
analyzed by immunohistochemistry, demonstrating that
3BrP, but not gemcitabine, strongly reduced the expression
of the stem cell markers ALDH1, CD44, CD133, Sox2,
and CxCR4 and the proliferation marker Ki67, whereas
the apoptosis marker “cleaved fragment of active caspase
3” was strongly enhanced (Fig. 5F, Fig. S3). Although
the chick embryo model is innovative and cost- and timeeffective, we wondered whether 3BrP alone or combined
with gemcitabine would also inhibit the growth of human
tumor xenografts in mice. PANC-1 and primary T29 PDA
cells were subcutaneously transplanted into the flanks of
immunodeficient mice. After development of tumors, the
mice received intraperitoneal injections with PBS, 3BrP,
gemcitabine or 3BrP combined with gemcitabine for 3
consecutive days, followed by a break of 4 days and a
new round of treatment. The administration of 3BrP or
gemcitabine alone decreased the tumor growth, but the
combination of both agents was superior and completely
prevented tumor growth in both, the PANC-1 and the
T29-derived tumor xenografts (Fig. 6A, C). No significant
effects of the treatment to the body weight of mice were
observed (Fig. 6B, D). Immunohistochemistry of tumor
tissue sections obtained from PANC-1 xenografts reveals
that the single treatments reduced the expression of the
ALDH1, CD44, Sox2, CxCR4 and Ki-67, and induced
cleavage of Caspase-3, whereas both treatments together
had strongest effects (Fig. S4). These data suggest
that 3BrP reduces xenograft growth and enhances the
therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine with no obvious side
effects.

inhibited the expression of CSC markers (Fig. 7C, Fig.
S5A, B, C). In contrast, gemcitabine had no effect on the
expression of CSC markers or apoptosis induction. These
data confirm our previous findings and suggest that the
inhibition of glucose metabolism by 3BrP prevents stem
cell signaling, thereby increasing the effectiveness of
gemcitabine.

DISCUSSION
In our study, we observed the strongly inhibited
growth of highly malignant PDA cells upon glucose
deprivation, whereas less aggressive PDA cells or normal
cells were barely affected. Additionally, colony formation
as a feature of the self-renewal potential was strongly
inhibited by glucose deprivation or LDH-A inhibition
by siRNA transfection. The anti-glycolytic agent 3BrP
strongly reduced the viability of the highly malignant PDA
cells in a pyruvate- and lactate-dependent manner, but
had a reduced effect in less aggressive and gemcitabinesensitive PDA cells and only marginally affected normal
cells. Interestingly, 3BrP is known to inhibit HKII, which
mediates the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate
in the first step of glycolysis [16]. This situation, together
with the overall effect of 3BrP in impairing cell function
by inducing an ATP collapse [15], may have sensitized and
eliminated CSC features in our cellular models.
Although no clinical trials, with the exception of a
case report, have been documented to date, several 3BrPbased pre-clinical studies with different tumor entities
indicate that this alkylating agent is able to overcome
therapy resistance [15]. This observation is supported by
our study in which we combined 3BrP with gemcitabine,
a combination that has not been previously studied. We
examined the sensitizing effect by in vitro and in vivo
xenotransplantation studies. A concentration of 50 µM
3BrP was very effective in depleting NAD(P)H and ATP
levels in highly malignant PDA cells, as concluded from
the reduced viability measured using MTT and Cell Titer
Glo assays. Furthermore, the ability to grow as colonies
and spheres and the tumor-forming potential in vivo was
strongly reduced and almost completely abolished with
the combination of 3BrP and gemcitabine. This finding
is supported by our western blot and NF-κB EMSA
results, which showed that 3BrP, but not gemcitabine,
strongly inhibited several markers involved in stemness
and pluripotency, specifically enhanced NF-κB binding
activity, ALDH1 expression and activity and such factors
as Notch-1, Oct-4, Sox2, c-Met, CD44, and CxCR4. Our in
vivo findings that 3BrP inhibited tumor growth, invasion,
and metastasis of cells after xenografting to fertilized
chicken eggs or mice are in agreement with the results
of a recent study. In that study, the tumor progression
of PANC-1 xenografts orthotopically transplanted to
the mouse pancreas was completely inhibited by the
ultrasound-guided intratumoral injection of 3BrP [20],

3BrP inhibits the growth and expression of CSC
markers in patient-derived primary CSCs
To study the effects of 3BrP in primary CSCs,
we used the tumor xenograft lines T22, T29, and T30,
in which c-Met expression was enriched by serial
transplantation of patient tissue on mice to about 50%
(Fig. 7A). This percentage was further enriched to 75%
c-Met positive cells by growing the isolated tumor cells
as anchorage-independent spheres (Fig. 7B, C), which
favors the growth of CSCs. The spheres were treated with
3BrP and gemcitabine alone or together. 3BrP strongly
diminished the size of spheroids, and gemcitabine had a
minor effect. However, the combination treatment was
strongest (Fig. 7B) and led to the complete elimination
of spheroidal cells in the second-generation spheroids.
Immunocytochemistry and analyses of the positive cells
revealed that 3BrP significantly induced apoptosis, and

with no observed adverse events. We also did not observe
side effects because the weight of the chicken embryos or
mice was not diminished significantly and liver necrosis
was not detected.
Our data are in accordance with the recent finding
that 3BrP disrupts the clonogenic capacity of human
KG1 leukemia cells, RPMI8226 myeloma cells, and
HepG2 hepatoma cells [23]. The authors of this study
suggest that the 3BrP-mediated depletion of ATP inhibits
ATP-dependent efflux pumps and thus restores drug
sensitivity along with the disruption of clonogenicity. This
mechanism might have contributed in our system. Another
recent interesting study suggests that 3BrP sensitivity is
determined by the expression of the SLC16A1 gene
product, mono-carboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), which
is the main determinant of 3BrP uptake by cancer cells
[24]. In accordance with our finding of 3BrP sensitivity
of MIA-PaCa2 and PANC-1 cells, these two cell lines
express MCT1 [25], whereas MCT1 expression to our
knowledge was not examined in the other cell lines used
in the present study. Given its reactivity as alkylator, 3BrP
would be expected to alkylate not only proteins but also
DNA and RNA, similar to e.g. cisplatin, No such DNA
damage or DNA/RNA alkylation have been reported,
however [26]. In line with this assumption, a case control
study [21] and our own data suggest that the side effects
of 3BrP are tolerable.
In conclusion, our findings extend the knowledge
about the remarkable anti-cancer properties of 3BrP
against CSCs and there is an urgent need to bring 3BrP to
clinical trials.

negative cultures were ensured by monthly mycoplasma
tests.

Reagents
3BrP (bromopyruvic acid >97% pure, SigmaAldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany), 2-deoxyd-glucose (2-DG, Sigma-Aldrich), Bortezomib (B, Selleck
Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA) were freshly dissolved in
sterile PBS. Sodium lactate (>99% pure, Sigma-Aldrich)
and sodium pyruvate (>99% pure Sigma-Aldrich)
were freshly dissolved in the cell culture medium. A
gemcitabine solution (126 mM, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis,
IN, USA) was diluted in the cell culture medium (100 µM
stock). The final concentrations of the solvents in media
were 0.1% or less.

Selection of CSC-enriched spheroidal cells from
patient tumors
Surgical,
non-diagnostic
specimens
were
transplanted into NMRI (nu/nu) mice followed by
subtransplantation and ex vivo spheroidal culture as
described [28, 29]. The patient material was obtained under
the approval of the ethics committee of the University of
Heidelberg after written informed consent was obtained
from the patients. The diagnoses were established by
conventional clinical and histological criteria according
to the World Health Organization (WHO). All surgical
resections were indicated by the principles and practice of
oncological therapy.

METHODS

Measurement of glucose consumption and lactate
production

Human primary and established pancreatic
cancer cell lines

The extracellular glucose and lactate concentrations
in the culture supernatants were measured using a DRYCHEM FDC3500 machine (Fuji (Medical Co. Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) in the diagnostic laboratory of the University Clinic
Heidelberg.

The human established PDA lines MIA-PaCa2,
PANC-1, AsPC-1, BxPc-3, and Capan-2 and human CRL
4023 hTERT-HPNE immortalized pancreatic ductal cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). Human primary pancreatic stellate
cells were kindly provided by Dr. O. Strobel (General
Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Germany), and human
primary skin fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. H.J. Stark (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany). The established
cell lines were regularly cultured in high-glucose DMEM
(18 mmol/L glucose) supplemented with 10% FCS and
5% HEPES. The CRL 4023 cells were cultured in ATCC
complete growth medium. Primary PDA cell lines PaCa
DD 183, PaCa DD 159, and PaCa DD 135 were isolated
and cultured as described [27]. The established cell lines
were recently authenticated by a commercial service
(Multiplexion, Heidelberg, Germany). Mycoplasmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell viability assays
Cell
viability
was
measured
using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), as described previously [7], or using
the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay,
as described by the manufacturer (Promega GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany).

Annexin V staining and FACS analysis of
apoptosis

Transplantation of tumor cells to the CAM of
fertilized chicken eggs

The cells were treated with FITC-conjugated
annexin-V (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt,
Germany) and analyzed by FACS, as previously described
[30].

This assay was performed as we described recently
[32]. Tumor volumes were estimated using the following
formula: Volume = 4/3 × Π × r3 (r = 1/2 × √ of diameter 1
× diameter 2).

Detection of ALDH1 activity

Subcutaneous transplantation of PDA cells into
mice

The ALDEFLUOR substrate (Aldagen, Inc.,
Durham, NC, USA) was added to the tumor cells, and
the ALDH1 activity was measured by FACS analysis
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

PANC-1 or T29 cells (1 × 106) were transplanted
in 50 % matrigel/PBS s.c. to the left and right flanks of
five-week-old female NMRI-nu immunodeficient mice
(Janvier Labs, France) in a total volume of 100 µl. The
tumor sizes were measured and analyzed as described
previously [7]. The animal experiments were carried out
in the animal facilities of the University of Heidelberg
after approval by the authorities (Regierungspräsidium
Karlsruhe, Germany).

Colony and spheroid forming assay
Colony and spheroid forming assays were performed
as described previously [7].

Western blot analysis

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
staining

Whole-cell extracts were prepared using a standard
protocol [7], and the proteins were detected by western
blotting. The following antibodies were used: mouse mAbs
against human ALDH1 (BD Biosciences, Germany), Oct4 (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), and GLUT-1
(Thermo Scientific Inc., Germany); rabbit mAbs against
Notch1, Sox2, and LDH-A (Cell Signaling Technology,
MA, USA); rabbit polyclonal Ab against LDH-B (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Pierce, Bonn, Germany).

Staining was performed on 6-µm frozen tissue
sections or on spheroidal cultures as we described
previously [29]. The primary antibodies were: Rabbit
pAbs against human c-Met, CD133, and Sox2 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), CD44 (GeneTex Inc., USA); E-cadherin
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA); Ki67 (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA); the cleaved fragment of
activated human caspase-3 (R&D Systems, Abingdon,
UK); c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Germany);
ALDH1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, USA); and
CxCR4 (GeneTex Inc., USA); mouse mAb anticytokeratin 19 was from Abcam.

siRNA transfection targeting LDH1
Specific FlexiTube GeneSolution siRNAs against
LDH-A or LDH-B were obtained from Qiagen (MD,
USA), and the Mission siRNA Universal Negative Control
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Transfections were performed using the LipofectamineTM
RNAiMAX kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA; USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
The data obtained using the established and primary
cell lines, excluding both the antibody protein arrays and
patient xenograft-derived spheroidal cells, are presented
as the mean ± SD of at least three separate experiments
performed in triplicate. The statistical significance was
evaluated by Student’s t-test with a Bonferroni correction
(*p<0.05, **p<0.01). The experiments with the primary
spheroidal cells were performed twice, and at least 10
fields of view per staining were counted. The statistical
significance of a total number of at least 20 fields of view
was evaluated by Student’s t-test, and an analysis of
variance was performed.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of
NF-κB binding
Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using the
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents,
and the bandshift reaction was performed as we described
recently [31].
