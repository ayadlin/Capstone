Abstract
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) has important functions in maintaining genome stability via its role in mitosis. Because PLK1
is up-regulated in many invasive carcinomas, we asked whether it may also play a role in acquisition of invasiveness,
a crucial step in transition to malignancy. In a model of
metaplastic basal-like breast carcinoma progression, we found
that PLK1 expression is necessary but not sufficient to induce
invasiveness through laminin-rich extracellular matrix.
PLK1 mediates invasion via vimentin and B1 integrin, both
of which are necessary. We observed that PLK1 phosphorylates vimentin on Ser82, which in turn regulates cell surface levels of B1 integrin. We found PLK1 to be also highly
expressed in preinvasive in situ carcinomas of the breast.
These results support a role for the involvement of PLK1 in
the invasion process and point to this pathway as a potential
therapeutic target for preinvasive and invasive breast carcinoma treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11106–10]

Introduction
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a member of the well-conserved
family of polo-like kinases, which has four known members in
humans: PLK1, PLK2, PLK3, and PLK4. Silencing of PLK1 via small
interfering RNA (siRNA) induces apoptosis, interferes with mitosis
(1, 2), inhibits centrosome amplification (3), and down-regulates
response to DNA damage via BRCA2 phosphorylation (1). PLK1
mRNA level is transiently down-regulated in response to DNA
damage, and this is dependent on BRCA1 and its downstream
effectors, CHEK1 kinases (4). In addition to DNA damage and
mitosis, PLK1 has been implicated in the Golgi checkpoint pathway that ensures proper segregation of this organelle during cell
division (5).
Consistent with its known functions, PLK1 expression is
regulated during cell cycle progression: levels are low in G0, G1,
and S but begin to increase in G2 and peak in M phase. In general,
active proliferation has been correlated with high PLK1 levels and
differentiation (induced by factors in culture) is correlated with low
levels, whereas DNA damage acts as a transient down-regulator. In
normal tissues, PLK1 is found only in actively proliferating tissues,
such as placenta, and its expression increases in many invasive
carcinomas, including those of the breast, ovarian, esophageal,
head and neck, and skin (reviewed in ref. 6). Interestingly, PLK1

levels are also regulated by a direct interaction with the chaperone
heat shock protein Hsp90, which has recently been linked to
regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) function (7, 8).
Using the HMT-3522 cell line series, composed of the noninvasive S1 and S2, preinvasive S3-A, S3-B, and S3-C, and invasive
T4-2 constituting a faithful model for the metaplastic basal-like
breast cancer subtype (9, 10),1 here we found a role for PLK1 in
invasion, described a mechanism, and propose a therapeutic targeting strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Cells were grown in tissue culture monolayers (twodimensional) using Falcon tissue culture plastic or three-dimensional
laminin-rich extracellular matrix (lrECM; Matrigel, BD Biosciences) in
defined medium as described previously (11, 12). S2 and S3 cells were grown
under the same conditions as T4-2.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) for PLK1 was performed using the following primers (5¶-3¶):
aggctctgctcggatcga ( forward) and tctctttcgccggtggag (reverse). After having
determined linear range, conditions were as follows: 96jC for 3 min,
34 (96jC for 30 s, 58jC for 30 s, 72jC for 1 min), 72jC for 5 min.
Western blots. SDS-PAGE–based standard methods were used. Primary
antibodies were the following: PLK1, rabbit polyclonal to peptide 8-21,
PC382 (Chemicon) at 1:200 dilution; PLK2 (Novus) at 1:1,000 dilution; PLK4
(Novus) at 1:1,000 dilution; vimentin, rabbit polyclonal JM3634 (MBL
International) at 1:100 dilution; and phosphorylated vimentin (Ser82), D0953 (MBL International) at 1:500 dilution.
Invasion assay. Invasion through lrECM (Matrigel) was measured in
Boyden chamber assays essentially as described (13). The number of
invading cells (of 1  105 seeded) was determined after 48 h of incubation
(unless indicated otherwise) in either regular growth medium, medium
containing different concentrations of the GlaxoSmithKline compound, h1
function blocking antibody, and A2BII (Sierra BioSource), or medium containing 2-day conditioned medium from T4-2 cell cultures ( for induction of
invasion in S3-C cultures). For siRNA-treated T4-2 or S3-C cells, transfection
of 30 to 150 nmol/L oligo with siPORT NeoFX (Ambion) was performed
24 h after plating cells. After 48 h in culture, siRNA-treated cells were
trypsinized and seeded in Boyden chambers for invasion assays. siRNA
oligos against PLK1 (3¶ Alexa Fluor 488 labeled from Qiagen; DNA target
sequence: cgacttcgtgttcgtggtg, described in ref. 1), vimentin (oligo 1: Ambion
ID 138993; oligo 2: Ambion ID 138994; oligo 3: Ambion ID 138995), or
scrambled control siRNA (Silencer Cy3 labeled; Ambion) were used.
Synchronization. T4-2 cells were kept in DMEM/F12 for 6 h to
synchronize in G1, after 2 days of siRNA inhibition by PLK1 or
scrambled control. Cells were then plated over a thin layer of lrECM in
chamber slides, in parallel to plating cells on a similar layer of lrECM
for Boyden chamber invasion assays. The percentage of Ki67-positive
cells per total 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained nuclei was evaluated at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after release into optimal growth medium. A
minimum of 200 nuclei from three fields was counted for each replicate
chamber slide.

PLK1 and Invasiveness in a Breast Cancer Model
Apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling. Percentage apoptotic T4-2 cells after transfection
with scrambled control or PLK1 siRNAs were detected using the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay kit from Roche.
Cell surface expression. Live cells were immunostained in suspension
before fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde. Primary antibodies were used at
1:10 dilution and secondary antibodies at 1:100 dilution. Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis was performed using EPICS XL-MCL data
acquisition and display software on XL flow cytometry analyzers (University
of California at Berkeley Flow Cytometry Facility). Gating of forward light
scatter versus 90j light scatter allowed examination of intact cells only, and
FITC fluorescence peak was evaluated for its median value and corrected
using samples that had not been treated with primary antibody. Primary
antibodies were as follows: h1 integrin, MAB1959 (Chemicon), and activated
h1 integrin, HUTS-21 (BD PharMingen).
Tumorigenicity. We injected 2 million cells into the left and right fourth
inguinal mammary glands of female BALB/c athymic nude mice (Simonsen
Laboratories). To determine the effect of PLK1 down-regulation on
tumorigenicity, PLK1 or scrambled control siRNAs were transfected into
cells with 90% to 100% efficiency determined by using labeled siRNA oligos
(Cy3 for scrambled and Alexa Fluor 488 for PLK1) and examining the
percentage of cells containing the label by microscopy; cells were cultured
for 4 days, injected into the fat pad, and allowed to form tumors for 5 weeks
(minimum time needed for all T4-2 to form tumors).
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human
breast tissue sections were obtained from the University of California at
San Francisco (UCSF), Breast Specialized Program of Research Excellence,
tissue core, or US Biomax, Inc. as 5-Am-thick serial sections. The samples
from UCSF contained histologically normal, ductal carcinoma in situ

(DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) areas on the same section, as
reported by the case pathologist and found in the archive records, and H&E
sections were examined and confirmed by the UCSF tissue core staff. The
tissue from US Biomax contained pure DCIS (Fmg020247B, Fmg020341B,
Fmg020358B, and Fmg020585B). The paraffin was removed by incubation in
xylene and graded alcohols. Tissues were blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide
in PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating in 0.01% prewarmed
trypsin in PBS followed by microwaving in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer.
Tissues were blocked in 1.5% normal horse serum in PBS and incubated
with 10 Ag/mL of PLK1 antibody [anti-PLK1, human (rabbit); Calbiochem].
Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit
antibody [1:200 dilution, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG/anti-rabbit IgG (H+L);
Vector Laboratories] followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(Vectastain ABC kit, Elite; Vector Laboratories) and complete 3,3¶diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) medium. Slides were washed
and counterstained with hematoxylin followed by dehydration in graded
alcohols and xylene. Signal intensity in each cell was scored using a Zeiss
Axioskop on a scale of 0 to 3. A minimum of 100 cells was counted for all
existing distinct normal, DCIS, and IDC areas per case.

Results
Given that PLK1 levels are misregulated in invasive carcinomas,
we asked whether it could be involved in acquisition of
invasiveness. To determine whether there was a correlation
between PLK1 expression levels and invasiveness in the HMT3522 metaplastic breast carcinoma model (Fig. 1A), we examined
PLK1 mRNA and protein levels in these cells, grown either in twodimensional or three-dimensional lrECM cultures (Fig. 1B).

Expression levels were different in S1, S2, S3-A, and S3-B cells and
did not correlate directly with invasion, suggesting that PLK1
expression per se is not sufficient for invasion. Consistent with this,
overexpression of PLK1 in S3-C cells had dominant-negative effects
on growth, as had been observed also previously (14), and did
not induce invasion (data not shown). To determine if PLK1 is
necessary for invasion, we down-regulated PLK1 levels in T4-2
and in induced S3-C cells using a published siRNA against PLK1 (1),
which did not down-regulate the levels of PLK homologues PLK2
or PLK4 (Supplementary Fig. S1). This specific down-regulation
of PLK1 level significantly decreased invasion (Fig. 1C). In addition, a chemical inhibitor of PLK1 from GlaxoSmithKline induced
a dose-dependent inhibition of invasion, confirming the siRNA
results (data not shown for proprietary reasons dictated by GlaxoSmithKline).
To explore the relationship between the effect of PLK1 on growth
and invasion, we synchronized cells before plating on lrECM in the
chamber, determining both the proportion of cycling cells and the
number of invading cells at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1D). Ki67
staining at 3 h after release from synchronization showed that
almost complete growth arrest was maintained for both PLK1 and
control siRNA-treated T4-2 cells. At 6 and 12 h, there was no
significant difference in percentage of Ki67-positive cells but the
number of invading cells was significantly lower in the PLK1
siRNA-treated cells compared with control. The observation that
the number of invading cells is down-regulated before the number
of cycling cells is affected by PLK1 siRNA treatment allowed us to
separate the effect of PLK1 on invasion from its effects on growth.
In addition, using the proprietary GlaxoSmithKline inhibitor of
PLK1 in T4-2 cells, we saw a reduction in invasion using two
concentrations that were too low to affect growth (data not shown
for proprietary reasons dictated by GlaxoSmithKline).
Because PLK1 siRNA has been shown to increase apoptosis in
some cell types, we examined the effect of treating T4-2 cells with
either PLK1 or scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 1E). Although there is

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

a trend toward increased apoptosis in PLK1 siRNA-treated cells
after 72 h, there was no significant increase in apoptosis during the
time course of the invasion assay (48–72 h) to account for the
observed effects of PLK1 down-regulation on invasion.
Based on reports that PLK1 phosphorylates vimentin on Ser82
(15), and that phosphorylation of vimentin by PKCq on NH2terminal serines (Ser4, Ser6, Ser7, Ser8, and Ser9 tested in
combination) is important for retargeting of endocytosed h1
integrin to the cell surface in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (16), we
postulated that PLK1 might function in cellular invasion by
phosphorylating vimentin on Ser82, thereby affecting h1 integrinmediated invasion through lrECM (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of vimentin
by siRNA down-regulated invasion (Fig. 2B). h1 integrin was
expressed at a higher level on the surface of T4-2 cells than in S1,
S2, and S3s, and its inhibition resulted in a decrease of invasiveness
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The effects of downregulating PLK1, vimentin, and h1 integrin function were not
additive or synergistic in any combination (Fig. 2D), suggesting
that the three proteins may function in the same invasion pathway.
Knocking down PLK1 down-regulated the level of Ser82 phosphorylated vimentin (Fig. 3A), as well as decreasing the cell surface
levels of h1 integrin (Fig. 3C), as did knocking down vimentin
(Fig. 3C). Expressing mutant vimentin that contained a nonphosphorylatable Ser82 down-regulated invasion compared with
the wild-type (WT) vimentin control, which had a higher level of
phosphorylated Ser82 (Fig. 3B), as well as decreasing the total and
activated h1 integrin levels on the cell surface (Fig. 3D).
To explore the relevance of this PLK1-mediated invasion
mechanism to tumor phenotypes in vivo, we found that downregulating PLK1 decreased the tumorigenicity of T4-2 cells in the
mouse mammary fat pad (Fig. 4A). To ask whether PLK1 inhibition
could potentially be used in treatment of preinvasive breast
disease, we determined if in situ carcinomas expressed it. It was
previously reported (6) that there was no detectable expression in
normal tissues and that the invasive tumors displayed high

immunohistochemical signal. We confirmed these data: normal =
0.28 F 0.15; invasive = 1.96 F 0.06 (Fig. 4B and D). Interestingly, in
the eight patient-matched biopsies we examined, in situ carcinoma
lesions had higher levels of expression than invasive carcinoma
regions on the same section: in situ = 2.64 F 0.84; invasive = 1.90 F
0.15 (P = 1.57  10 5; Fig. 4C and D). The high expression in DCIS

was not simply because of being adjacent to IDC because in four
pure DCIS samples examined we also observed high level of PLK1
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2). Given our finding above that a
reduction in PLK1 reduces invasion significantly, these results may
indicate the use of PLK1 inhibitory compounds in treatment of
DCIS as well.

Discussion
PLK1 is up-regulated in many invasive carcinomas and is
important for maintaining genome stability via its functions in
mitosis (17). Here, we found that PLK1 is involved also in
acquisition of invasiveness in vimentin-expressing cells via
regulating cell surface h1 integrin levels (Figs. 2 and 3). Such
acquired ‘‘moonlighting’’ functions have been described for
several other proteins as well (18, 19). It is possible that the
normal function of PLK1 in mediating intermediate filamentregulated events in cytokinesis manifests itself aberrantly when
placed in the context of a malignant cell, resulting in a
regulatory function for invasion. Although we showed a role for
PLK1 in invasion via vimentin and h1 integrin, recent data on
the involvement of the yeast polo-like kinase, CDC5, in
cytokinesis via targeting and activation of RhoA at the cleavage
furrow (20) suggest that actin filaments could potentially be
involved in this regulation as well.
During mitosis, adherent cells first round up and decrease their
attachment to the substratum, but after cytokinesis, they increase
attachment and spread. The dynamics of attachment and
detachment is critical for cells to go through mitosis (21).
Consistent with this, we found the cell surface levels of h1 integrin
to be regulated by PLK1 via phosphorylation of vimentin on Ser82
(Fig. 3). Importantly, however, we found that the effects of PLK1 on
mitosis and invasion are separable (Fig. 2; GlaxoSmithKline
compound data). Additional support for the separability of mitosis
and invasion effects in this pathway comes from our observation
that vimentin siRNAs, which down-regulate invasion, do not have
any effects on growth (data not shown).

In addition to PLK1, Ku80, which is important in maintaining
genome stability via double-strand break repair, is involved in
invasion (19). Ku80 interacts with MMP9 on the cell surface, and its
inhibition results in reduced activity of MMP9 and invasion. PLK1
down-regulation, however, does not affect MMP9 activity (data not
shown), suggesting an MMP9-independent function. In addition,
we found that the centromeric protein CENPA and the doublestrand break repair protein XRCC3 were involved in invasion in
Boyden chamber assays, whereas the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide
reductase RRM2 was not (data not shown). We have now dubbed
genes such as PLK1, CENPA, XRCC3, and Ku80 as genomic instability
and extracellular matrix invasion (GISEM) genes. Targeting the acquired or moonlighting invasion function in malignant cells without
disrupting the ability of GISEM genes, such as PLK1, to maintain a
stable genome in normal cells could contribute to the development
of anticancer therapeutics with reduced toxicity.
