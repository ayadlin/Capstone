Abstract
Accumulating data have implicated the selenium-containing
cytosolic glutathione peroxidase, GPx-1, as a determinant of
cancer risk and a mediator of the chemopreventive properties
of selenium. Genetic variants of GPx-1 have been shown to be
associated with cancer risk for several types of malignancies.
To investigate the relationship between GPx-1 enzyme activity
and genotype, we measured GPx-1 enzyme activity and protein
levels in human lymphocytes as a function of the presence of
two common variations: a leucine/proline polymorphism at
codon 198 and a variable number of alanine-repeat codons.
Differences in GPx activity among these cell lines, as well as in
the response to the low-level supplementation of the media
with selenium, indicated that factors other than just genotype
are significant in determining activity. To restrict the study to
genotypic effects, human MCF-7 cells were engineered to
exclusively express allelic variants representing a combination
of either a codon 198 leucine or proline and either 5 or 7
alanine-repeat codons following transfection of GPx-1 expression constructs. Transfectants were selected and analyzed for
GPx-1 enzyme activity and protein levels. GPx-1 with 5
alanines and a leucine at codon 198 showed a significantly
higher induction when cells were incubated with selenium and
showed a distinct pattern of thermal denaturation as
compared with GPx-1 encoded by the other examined alleles.
The collective data obtained using both lymphocytes and
MCF-7 indicate that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors
cooperate to ultimately determine the levels of this enzyme
available to protect cells against DNA damage and mutagenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8183–90]

Introduction
There is considerable interest in developing strategies for
prevention of cancer that involve minimal risk or toxicity. Selenium
is an essential trace element for which many years of animal
studies have shown that low, nontoxic supplementation with either
organic and inorganic forms could reduce cancer incidence
following exposure to a wide variety of carcinogens (1). In humans,
several studies have shown that there is an inverse association
between nutritional selenium intake and cancer risk, although not
all reports have indicated this relationship (2). The promise of
selenium supplementation in the diet as a means of reducing

cancer risk was stimulated by the results of the study conducted by
the National Prevention of Cancer (NPC) Study Group that
reported that supplementation with 200 Ag/d selenium as selenized
yeast reduced cancer incidence (3, 4). Follow-up analyses to this
study have indicated that those with the lowest base-line levels of
selenium exhibited the greatest benefit (4). This study, along with
the wealth of in vitro and animal data supporting a potential
chemopreventive role for selenium, has led to the large cancer
prevention trial (SELECT) investigating the efficacy of selenium,
both alone and in combination with vitamin E, in reducing prostate
cancer incidence (5). However, this trial was recently terminated
early due to the apparent lack of protection by selenium (6).
Selenium exists within the cell as both nonprotein metabolites
and selenoproteins containing the UGA-encoded amino acid
selenocysteine, often located at the protein’s active site (7, 8).
Nonprotein forms of selenium have been shown to have
antitumor activity in animal models and to influence the
expression of signaling pathways involved in the carcinogenic
process (9). Alternatively, selenium may influence cancer incidence by its effects on selenoprotein levels or function (10).
Studies to investigate the role of selenoproteins independent of
selenium status were greatly facilitated by the development of the
i6A transgenic mouse model (11). These animals express
reduced selenoprotein levels due to the ectopic expression of a
mutant selenocysteine tRNA gene, but do not exhibit overt signs
of pathology unless further challenged. However, i6A mice
showed accelerated development of prostate pathology indicative
of carcinogenesis as compared with control mice (12) and are
more susceptible to the development of aberrant crypt foci, a
colonic preneoplastic lesion, following the administration of
carcinogen (13).
Of the 25 selenoproteins shown to be encoded by the human
genome (14), genetic data have implicated the seleniumdependent, cytosolic form of glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) in
cancer etiology. The gene for GPx-1 is frequently deleted during
cancer development, with loss of heterozygosity being shown in
breast, colon, and lung cancers, as well as cancers of the head and
neck (10). In addition, common polymorphisms in the GPx-1 gene
have been shown to be associated with cancer risk. A codon 198
variation resulting in either a leucine (leu) or a proline (pro) at
this position has been described (15). The risk of cancers of the
bladder, lung, breast, and liver has been positively associated with
the leu allele (16), and lung cancer patients harboring the leu
allele were shown to excrete higher levels of the DNA oxidation
product 8-hydroxy-2¶-deoxyguanosine in their urine (17). Not all
studies have shown the relationship between the codon 198
polymorphism and cancer risk, and it is notable that the
association between the leu allele and cancer risk was reported
for liver and breast cancer, but only when present in conjunction

with an allele for another at-risk polymorphism in the gene for
manganese superoxide dismutase (18, 19). Another GPx-1
variation, a variable number of alanine-repeat codons in the
NH2 terminus of the protein, has been associated with higher risk
of cancer as well (20–23).
The data summarized above indicate a possible role of the GPx-1
selenium-containing protein in cancer etiology. Because the
activity of this protein is responsive to selenium availability in
the diet, it is possible that the chemopreventive activity of selenium
may be dependent, at least in part, on allelic-specific effects on
enzyme activity. Here, we examine the levels and activity of GPx-1,
as well the response of the protein to selenium levels, in human
lymphocytes as well as MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells engineered to
express different GPx-1 allelic variants.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Immortalized human lymphoblast cell lines were obtained
from the cell repository of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and
incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a
humidified atmosphere at 37jC with 5% CO2. The MCF-7 human breast
carcinoma cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and the derivative lines were maintained in modified Eagle’s medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37jC with 5% CO2. Transfectants were generated using the Lipofectin transfection reagent
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Colonies were selected
with 500 Ag/mL G418 (Sigma), expanded, and then screened for GPx-1
activity.
Genotyping at the GPx-1 locus. The identity of the GPx-1 codon 198
polymorphism in the lymphocyte cell lines used in this study was previously
reported (24). Genotyping the trinucleotide repeat (GCG) variation in exon
1, which results in 5, 6, or 7 Ala repeats in the NH2 terminus of the protein,
was done. Sequences were amplified using the forward primer ALAREPF
(5¶-pCCTGCACTGCCGGTAACAT-3¶) and the reverse primer ALAREPR
(5¶-pCGCCGAGAAGGCATACA-3¶), and the products sequenced using the
sequence primer ALAREPSEQ2 (5¶-GCACTCTCCAGCCTTTTCC-3¶) by the
Research Resource Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Generation of derivative GPx-1 expression constructs. GPx-1 expression constructs containing 5 alanine repeats and differing only by a single
nucleotide resulting in either a leucine or proline at GPx-1 codon 198
(designated hGPX198pro) and (hGPX198leu) were previously generated (25).
Using these constructs as templates, derivative hGPx-1 plasmids with 7
alanine repeats were generated using the QuikChange Site Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Invitrogen) using the forward primer 5¶-pCTAGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCCCAG-3¶ and the reverse primer 5¶-pCTGGGCCGCCGCCGCCGCGCGCGCTAG-3¶ for mutagenesis. Successful mutagenesis was
confirmed by sequencing using services provided by the Research Resource
Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
A derivative GPx-1 mutant designated as A5/Leu-Y96F was generated by
in vitro mutagenesis, resulting in a change of codon 96 from tyrosine (Y) to
phenylalanine (F) using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Stratagene). Template DNA was amplified using two overlapping primers
( forward primer, 5¶-pGAATTCCCTCAAGTTCGTCCGGCCTGGTG-3¶; reverse
primer, 5¶-pCACCAGGCCGGACGAACTTGAGGGAATTC-3¶) and digested by
DpnI to cleave the original unaltered template. Successful mutagenesis was
confirmed by Rsa1 diagnostic digestion.
GPx-1 activity and levels. GPx activity was determined by coupled
spectrophotometric assay using hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide as substrate (25). Assays were minimally done in triplicate, using three
independently generated lysates, and activity was reported as nanomoles of
NADPH oxidized per minute per milligram of protein. GPx-1 protein levels
were determined by Western blotting by electrophoresis of extracts on 14%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then transferred onto polyvinylidine
fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and detected using affinitypurified anti–hGPx-1 or mouse anti-human GPx-1 monoclonal antibodies

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

(mAb; MBL) as previously described (12). Filters were also probed with
anti–h-actin antibodies to control for equal loading of protein on the gel.
GPx-1 or the h-actin band density was measured with a Fluor-S MAX
MutiImager (Bio-Rad) using three independently generated lysates from
each MCF-7 transfectant. The same lysates used for Western blot analysis
were used to measure GPx-1 enzyme activity.
GPx-1 isolation by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry.
Harvested cells were lysed, with the debris removed by centrifugation, and
were incubated with mouse mAb to human GPx-1 (Abcam) overnight at
4jC and then bound to protein G beads (rec-Protein G-Sepharose 4B
Conjugate, Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitated samples were electrophoresed
on a 14% Tris-glycine gel and stained overnight with Coomassie G-250 stain.
GPx-1 protein was excised and digested, and fragments were analyzed by
mass spectrometry (MS) at the Research Resources Center at UIC by LCMSMS using a Thermo Finnigan LTQFT mass spectrometer interfaced to a
Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography system.
Peptides were loaded to an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trapping cartridge,
eluted onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 capillary column, and separated
at 200 nL/min. The gradient is as follows: 0 to 5 min 100% A, 7 min 10% A,
47 min 60% A, 52 min 90% A, and 57 min 90% A. The column was
equilibrated with 100% A for 5 min before the next injection. Solvent A was
95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was 5% water,
95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Data-dependent MS/MS analysis was set
up as follows: A high-resolution Fourier transform scan was done at 100,000
resolution, followed by collisionally induced dissociation MS/MS analysis of
the five most intense ions with signal count >1,000.
Statistical analysis. The differences in the fold induction of GPx-1
activity in response to selenium supplementation were assessed by twotailed Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
Two-way ANOVAs were two-sided and were done using SAS 9.1.

Results
Variations in GPx enzyme activity and response to selenium
among human lymphoblast cell lines. GPx activity was
determined in a collection of 30 human lymphoblast cell lines
established by EBV immortalization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and obtained from the Coriell Repository. The partial
GPx-1 gene sequence from each of these cell lines has been
reported (24), and the identity of the nucleotide polymorphism
resulting in a leucine or proline at codon 198 was confirmed by
RFLP analysis (data not shown). To extend these data to include
another genetic variation in GPx-1, that being the presence of 4, 5,
or 6 GCG triplets in the NH2-terminal coding portion of the gene
(20), the DNA from these lines was genotyped to determine the
number of alanine-repeat codons by direct sequencing following
PCR amplification. This additional genetic information expanded
the previously reported number of common GPx-1 haplotypes,
and the genotypes of each of these cell lines are presented in
Table 1.
GPx enzyme activity was determined for each of the lymphoblast
cell lines whose genotypes are presented in Table 1. To determine
whether GPx activity would be stimulated in the lymphoblastoid
cells by selenium addition, cultures were incubated in medium
supplemented with 30 nmol/L selenium in the form of sodium
selenite for 3 days. The dosage and form of selenium used in the
studies here allowed direct comparisons with our previous
published studies (25–28). The data presented in Fig. 1 indicate
that lymphocyte cell lines expressed significant variation in GPx-1
enzyme activity when cultured under standard conditions (7.3–64.7
units/mg protein). The degree of induction of GPx-1 activity
following selenium supplementation was different among the cell
lines, ranging from as low as 1.3-fold (GM11524) to as high as 6.9fold (GM12912).

The degree of variation observed among these cell lines was
unexpected given the fact that the lines were derived from the
same cell type, and this observation was even extended to cell
lines with the same GPx-1 haplotype. For example, examining
the data for several cell lines with the most common GPx-1
haplotype (A5,7/Pro, homozygous for Pro198 and heterozygoous
for 5 and 7 Ala repeats), the observed baseline GPx-1 activity
ranged from 7.7 units/mg protein (GM06990) to 37.0 units/mg
protein (GM12909). The degree of induction of enzyme activity
observed when the medium was supplemented with selenium
ranged from 1.6-fold (GM07349) to 6.4-fold (GM06990). Thus, neither
genotype nor haplotype alone was the only determinant for either
baseline activity or the degree of induction, and this observation also
extended to the other genotypes presented in Table 1.
Selenium supplementation increases GPx-1 protein levels
in lymphocytes. We have previously observed that induction of
GPx-1 activity achieved with selenium supplementation is due to
enhanced translation and not transcription (25). This was shown
to be the case for the lymphocytes as well. GPx-1 protein levels
were analyzed in extracts obtained from five different lymphocyte cell lines that were all homozygous for both the codon 198

www.aacrjournals.org

and the alanine-repeat polymorphisms by Western blot analysis,
and the intensity of the GPx-1 band observed approximated the
levels of activity determined by enzyme assay (Fig. 2).
GPx-1 allele-specific response to selenium supplementation
in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The lymphocyte cell lines
described above were each obtained from different individuals
and therefore represent distinct cellular environments that are
likely to influence GPx-1 activity, in addition to any consequences
of GPx-1 genotype alone. To focus on genotype effects, allelespecific GPx-1 expression constructs were generated by in vitro
mutagenesis. GPx-1 expression constructs representing combinations of either a leucine or a proline triplet at codon 198 and 5 or 7
alanine repeats at the NH2 terminus of the protein were generated.
Human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells are a useful tool to study
the effect of GPx-1 polymorphisms in a clonal cell population.
These cells express negligible GPx-1 activity and mRNA (25, 29).
Thus, MCF-7 cells transfected with GPx-1 expression constructs
allow for the essentially exclusive expression of transfected
GPx-1 alleles in mammalian cells. These constructs were transfected
into MCF-7 cells, and G418-resistant colonies were expanded for
further analysis.

Figure 1. Human lymphocytes cell lines exhibit
different baseline and selenium-induced GPx
enzyme activities. The genotypes of the 30 selected
lymphocyte cell lines at the alanine-repeat and codon
198 polymorphisms are presented in Table 1. The
GPx activity obtained with or without 30 nmol/L
sodium selenite (Se ) for 3 d is presented in the
graph. Columns, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, SD.

Sodium selenite is commonly used for cell culture and animal
studies, and selenomethionine is the most common form of
selenium obtained from the diet. To test whether GPx-1 alleles
respond differently to these sources of selenium, the culture
medium of MCF-7 transfectants was supplemented with increasing
doses of either sodium selenite (Fig. 3A) or selenomethionine
(Fig. 3B) for 3 days. Both forms of selenium supplementation
significantly increased GPx-1 activity, with the A5/Pro, A7/Pro, and
A7/Pro transfectants exhibiting approximately 4- to 8-fold (sodium
selenite) or 3- to 6-fold (selenomethionine) increase in activity
(Fig. 3). As is typically observed, more selenomethionine was
required to achieve a similar induction in activity as was obtained
with the more bioavailable form of selenium, selenite. In contrast,
there was a greater induction in GPx-1 activity in cells expressing
the A5/Leu, when exposed to either sodium selenite (234.6 and
347.1 units/mg protein at 50 and 100 nmol/L, respectively) or
selenomethionine (119.3 and 241.6 units/mg protein at 100 and
250 nmol/L, respectively). The induction of GPx-1 activity observed
for A5/Leu was 35.0- to 51.7-fold with sodium selenite (Fig. 3A) or
17.8- to 36.0-fold with selenomethionine (Fig. 3B).
Selenium increases GPx-1 protein levels in MCF-7 cells. To
quantify GPx-1 protein levels in transfectants at both baseline
culture conditions and following selenium supplementation, GPx-1
protein in the same cellular extracts used to measure activity was
assessed by Western blotting with anti–GPx-1 antibodies (Fig. 3C).

Surprisingly, the amount of GPx-1 detected in the Western blots
was similar among the MCF-7 transfectants, despite differences in
the GPx-1 activity observed in the extracts. Both selenite and
selenomethionine supplementation significantly increased GPx-1
protein levels with similar patterns.
Effect of genetic variations and selenium on GPx-1
structure. There is an expectation that polymorphisms that
affect the activity of an enzyme may also cause detectable
changes in the structure of that protein. As an initial attempt to
investigate the degree with which the selected variations in the
GPx-1 protein affect the molecular structure, the thermal stability
of the proteins was investigated. Enzyme activity over 10 minutes
at 55jC was measured and compared with the activity obtained
when the cell extract was maintained at 4jC. Differences in
thermostability were evident, with the greatest stability observed
for A5/Leu (Fig. 4A).
Because selenium supplementation of the culture medium was
also associated with increased activity, it was examined whether
incubation of cells with 30 nmol/L sodium selenite also influenced
GPx-1 thermostability. The data are presented in Fig. 4B and showed
that the selenium supplementation resulted in a significant increase
in stability at 55jC over the time course examined for A5/Pro,
A7/Leu, and A7/Pro alleles; in contrast, selenium supplementation
resulted in a decrease in stability for A5/Leu (Fig. 4B). These data
indicated that the naturally occurring amino acid differences among

blotting with an antihuman GPx-1 mAb, and the filter was

Consequences to Variations in GPx-1

GPx-1 alleles had a profound effect on protein structure and that
there were additional temperature-sensitive structural changes in
these proteins as a function of selenium availability.
Mutation of Tyr-96 from a tyrosine to a phenylalanine does
not change GPx-1 activity in MCF-7 cells. One possible means by
which polymorphisms or selenium availability might affect GPx-1
activity is by posttranslational modification. A tyrosine at GPx-1
codon 96 has been reported to be phosphorylated by the abl and
arg tyrosine kinases, resulting in the activation of that enzyme (30).
Analysis of each of the four GPx-1 alleles immunoprecipitated from
total protein extracts failed to reveal evidence for phosphorylation
(a) using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, (b) using the Pro-Q
Diamond phosphoprotein detection system, or (c) by assessing
changes in GPx-1 mobility by gel electrophoresis following
phosphatase treatment (data not shown). In addition, GPx-1
proteins immunoprecipitated from the allele-specific transfectants
were analyzed by MS. The sequences of the peptide fragments were
confirmed by comparison with the known human GPx-1 sequence.
Tyrosine phosphorylation of peptides may be identified by mass
shifts of 80 kDa; however, no phosphorylated peptides were
detected (data not shown).
To investigate a possible role of phosphorylation of Tyr-96 of
GPx-1, a derivative expression construct in which Tyr-96 was
converted to phenylalanine by in vitro mutagenesis was generated
and transfected into MCF-7 cells. Lysates containing both Tyr-96
GPx-1 and Phe-96 GPx-1 were assayed for GPx-1 enzyme activity
(Fig. 5A) and normalized to the amount of protein observed by
Western blotting of the same extracts (Fig. 5B). Mutation of Tyr-96
to a phenylalanine did not affect the enzyme induction with
100 nmol/L selenium or the specific activity determined by
normalizing the enzymatic activity by the amount of protein
obtained from the Western blot (Fig. 5C).

Discussion

Figure 3. Relative induction of GPx-1 levels in MCF-7 transfectants in response
to increasing doses of selenium supplementation. The growth medium of
MCF-7 transfectants was supplemented with increasing doses of selenium in the
form of either sodium selenite at 50 and 100 nmol/L (A ) or seleno-L-methionine at
100 and 250 nmol/L (B ), and cells were harvested for GPx enzyme activity
following 3 d of incubation. Points, mean fold induction of GPx-1 activity,
expressed as mean GPx-1 activity after selenium treatment relative to mean
GPx-1 activity at baseline (n = 3). The mean fold inductions observed for A5/Pro,
A7/Leu , and A7/Pro following treatment with either sodium selenite or
selenomethionine were not statistically different from each other, but in both
cases were significantly different for the mean fold induction observed for
A5/Leu (P < 0.0001). C, induction of GPx-1 protein levels coincides with the
induction of enzyme activity. The same extracts prepared for enzyme assay
(A and B ) were analyzed for GPx-1 protein levels by Western blotting with
antihuman GPx-1 and filters were reprobed with h-actin antibodies as a control
for equal loading of protein on the gel. pLNCX, vector without insert.

The studies described herein investigated the genetic and
molecular determinants of GPx-1 enzyme activity. Overexpression
of GPx-1 is associated with a wide range of effects, including the
prevention of apoptosis, the protection against toxicity, and the
reduction of DNA damage (31–36). Too much GPx-1 activity may
also have adverse effects, as exemplified by a recent report
indicating that its overexpression can disrupt mitochondrial
function (37). Given the human epidemiologic data indicating
significant associations between polymorphisms in GPx-1 and the
risk of several cancer types, the levels of GPx-1 activity in a single
cell type, lymphocytes, were examined at standard culturing
conditions and following supplementation of the culture media
with selenium in a collection of human lymphocyte cell lines.
Previous sequence analysis of the DNA from these lines revealed
multiple polymorphisms within the GPx-1 gene (24), and with the
additional data indicating the number of alanine repeats, there was
a lack of discernable pattern between genotype and GPx-1 activity,
both in the presence and in the absence of supplemented selenium.
This variation could be due to a wide range of possible differences
among the cellular environments within the cell lines examined,
including direct and indirect effects on transcriptional/translational
regulation or potential protein binding partners, changes that may
have developed during the passage of the lines. To minimize the
number of variables involved in GPx-1 regulation, expression of
allelic variants from a transfected construct was achieved in the
MCF-7 cell line that expresses marginal endogenous GPx-1 activity.

Figure 5. Mutation of Tyr at codon 96 of GPx-1 does not affect GPx-1 activity.
A GPx-1 mutant (A5/Leu-96F ) lacking tyrosine codon 198 was compared with
MCF-7 cells transfected with the unmodified A5/leu expression construct. The
media of both transfectants were supplemented with 100 nmol/L sodium selenite
for 3 d as indicated and GPx-1 activity was determined. A, GPx-1 activity
obtained after 3 d in 100 nmol/L sodium selenite. B, GPx-1 was quantified by
band density on the Western blot film. Data were expressed as GPx-1 band
density relative to h-actin band density of the same sample. C, specific GPx-1
activity was measured by normalizing enzyme activity to GPx-1 protein levels
determined by Western blot analysis. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD.

A, the GPx enzyme activity remaining after incubation of cellular extracts of the
indicated transfectant at 55jC was expressed as a percentage of the control
activity obtained when the same extract was maintained at 4jC. B, solid lines,

The MCF-7 transfectants, expressing combinations of the
Pro198Leu and alanine-repeat variations, showed increased GPx
activity with increasing selenium supplementation to the culture
media, as is generally seen for cells grown in culture (26, 28, 38–41)
as well as the lymphocyte lines examined here. And whereas the
amount of selenomethione achieving the same induction as with
selenite was higher, the patterns of induction for each individual
haplotype were very similar. Selenomethionine is converted to
H2Se through transulfuration and h-lyase cleavage, whereas
selenite interacts with glutathione to form selenodiglutathione,
which is subsequently reduced to H2Se. H2Se derived via both
pathways can be converted to selenophosphate, which is then used
in the synthesis of selenoproteins. This difference in selenium
metabolism is likely to account for the greater efficiency of
induction of selenite over selenomethionine, as has been reported

Consequences to Variations in GPx-1

for a variety of cell types (42–44). In all cases, the increase in
enzyme activity was paralleled by an increase in the amount of
GPx-1 protein as determined by Western blotting. Using MCF-7
cells transfected with a GPx-1 expression construct, it was
previously reported that the increase in protein obtained by
selenium supplementation occurred without an increase in steadystate GPx-1 mRNA levels (25), and neither form of selenium used
(Fig. 3) resulted in an increase in GPx-1 mRNA as determined by
real time-PCR (data not shown).
After addition of selenium in the form of either selenite or
selenomethionine, GPx-1 enzyme activity increased to a similar
degree as that for the A5/Pro, A7/Leu and A7/Pro alleles, but the
induction obtained was much greater for the A5/Leu GPx-1 variant.
Whereas the studies reported herein were conducted using H2O2
as the GPx-1 substrate, similar patterns of induction were obtained
using a different substrate, cumene hydroperoxide (data not
shown). It has been suggested that the Pro198Leu polymorphism
may have a profound effect on the conformation of GPx-1 (17), and
the variable number of alanine repeats may also affect protein
structure and stability (23). Both the NH2 terminus of the protein
containing the alanine repeats and the COOH terminus including
the Pro198Leu polymorphism reside on the outer surface of each of
the four subunits that compose the functional protein (45, 46). The
distinct response to selenium of the A5/Leu variant as compared
with the others investigated here indicates that there is an
interaction between these two positions that ultimately influences
activity. Whereas such an interaction could affect the conformation, stability, or perhaps the subcellular localization of the protein
(i.e., to the mitochondria), it is also possible that the identity of the
amino acids at these positions affects the interaction of GPx-1 with
other cellular proteins given that assays were conducted using
whole-cell extracts. Future studies to investigate the effect of allelic
differences in protein structure on GPx-1 enzyme function will be
done on purified protein to determine any contributions of the
identity of the amino acid at codon 198 to enzyme kinetics and/or
interaction with other cellular proteins.
Previous work has shown that phosphorylation of GPx-1 at Tyr96 by the c-arg or c-abl tyrosine kinases results in the activation of
the protein (30). However, using GPx-1 obtained from MCF-7
transfectants, no evidence of phosphorylation could be found. In
addition, changing the tyrosine at position 96 to phenylalanine did
not alter the response of the protein to selenium or its specific
enzyme activity. One possible explanation for the differences
observed is that the previous work showing GPx-1 phosphorylation
was conducted using a derivative GPx-1 in which the active-site
selenocysteine was converted to a cysteine, and these previous
studies were done in a human embryonic kidney epithelium cell
line (30) as compared with the breast carcinoma cells used here.
The surprising interaction between the GPx-1 Pro198Leu and
alanine-repeat variations raises some interesting possibilities with
regard to cancer risk in humans. There have been several reports
showing an association between the leu allele of GPx-1 and the risk
of cancer at several different sites, although not all studies have

seen this relationship. One particular study reported associations
between the leu allele and both lower GPx-1 enzyme activity and
the risk of breast cancer (47). The in vitro studies presented here
used doses in the nanomolar range to distinguish the allelic
responses to selenium supplementation, only a few-fold higher
than the total selenium in the culture media provided in the FBS.
In contrast, human serum typically contains approximately 1 to 2
Amol/L selenium, but much of this is in the form of selenoproteins
such as the plasma GPx (GPx-3) and selenoprotein P, and the
selenium concentration in specific organs can be considerably less,
as has been reported for prostate tissue, for example (48).
Therefore, individuals with the A5/Leu genotype may experience
a more dramatic decline in GPx-1 activity under conditions of
moderate selenium deficiency than individuals with the other
GPx-1 genotypes. Although few studies have examined the
interaction between both the codon 198 polymorphism and the
number of alanine repeats with regard to cancer risk, it is
noteworthy that Knight and colleagues (23) reported that
premenopausal women with the A5/Leu genotype were at a higher
risk of breast cancer as compared with women whose DNA
encoded a GPx-1 with 6 or 7 alanine codons.
Recently, the large prostate cancer prevention trial SELECT was
terminated early in part due to a lack of efficacy of selenium
provided in the form of selenomethionine (6). These results were in
contrast to results from an earlier supplementation study using the
same dose of selenium (200 Ag/d), but in a different form (selenized
yeast), which indicated that men in the lowest tertile of selenium
status saw a significant decline in prostate cancer incidence (3, 49).
In addition to the difference in forms of selenium used in these
trials, the baseline plasma selenium status of participants in
both these trials was considerably different, averaging 114 ng/mL
(1.44 mmol/L) for the NPC trial (3) and 135.0 ng/mL (1.71 mmol/L)
for SELECT (6). These contrasting results, when taken together
with the in vitro data presented here showing allelic differences in
the activity of GPx-1, an enzyme implicated in cancer etiology and
in its response to selenium availability, indicate that it is possible
that the benefits of selenium supplementation in the reduction of
prostate and perhaps other cancers might become apparent when
cohorts are stratified by both GPx-1 genotype and selenium status.
