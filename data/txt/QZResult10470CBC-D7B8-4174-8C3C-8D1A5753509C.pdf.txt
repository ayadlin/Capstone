Abstract

Author Manuscript

Androgen receptor splicing variants (ARVs) which lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD) are
associated with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), including
resistance to the new generation of high affinity anti-androgens. However, the mechanism by
which ARVs expression is regulated is not fully understood. In this study, we show that activation
of classical NF-κB signaling increases the expression of ARVs in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and
converts androgen sensitive PCa cells to become androgen insensitive; while, downregulation of
NF-κB signaling inhibits ARVs expression and restores responsiveness of CRPC to anti-androgen
therapy. In addition, we demonstrated that combination of anti-androgen with NF-κB targeted
therapy inhibits efficiently tumor growth of human CRPC xenografts. These results indicate that
induction ARVs by activated NF-κB signaling in PCa cells is a critical mechanism by which the
PCa progresses to CRPC. This has important implications since it can prolong the survival of
CRPC patients by restoring the tumors to once again respond to conventional androgendeprivation therapy (ADT).

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in the majority of prostate cancer (PCa) patients
results in initial regression of disease and a dramatic decrease in serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA). Eventually, all patients will fail ADT and the regrowing cancer is now
commonly referred to as Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). It is now clear that

Androgen Receptor Addiction (ARA) is the driving force behind the development of
CRPC.1 The recent development of abiraterone acetate, that blocks the synthesis of
androgens by the tumor, and the new high affinity anti-androgens, such as Enzalutamide
(formerly MDV3100), once again block androgen receptor (AR) action in CRPC validating
that the AR pathway is a central target for drug therapy.2,3 However, in due course, failure
to these new drugs occurs. Multiple pathways are proposed that result in continue AR
function4,5 but recent studies have reported the elevated expression of AR splice variants
(ARVs), which lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD), are associated with rapid progression
to CRPC.6-10 The ARVs result in constitutive activation of the AR pathway thereby
promoting PCa cell growth at even low concentrations of androgen,9,10 enhance growth of
androgen-dependent xenografts in castrated mice8 and the development of Enzalutamide
resistant PCa.11 Based on these findings, it has been proposed that ARVs can function as
important drivers of CRPC.6-8

Author Manuscript

ARVs originate from AR transcripts by insertions of cryptic exons downstream of the
coding sequences for AR DNA-binding domain (DBD),6-8,10 or by deletions of exons
coding for AR-LBD.9,12 These alterations in AR transcripts disrupt the AR open reading
frame, leading to truncated AR proteins with an intact N-terminal domain (NTD) and the
DNA binding domain (DBD), and in some cases a short variant-specific peptide replacing
the LBD.13 AR gene rearrangements have been proposed as one mechanism to explain the
appearance of truncated ARVs in PCa cell lines and xenografts.14,15 Most recently,
Nadiminty et al reported that activation of the non-canonical Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NFκB) pathway (NF-κB2/p52) can enhance expression of ARVs thereby contributing to
resistance to anti-androgen in PCa.16 However, the detailed mechanism(s) by which the
ARVs increase in advanced CRPC is still not fully understood.

NF-κB proteins are an important class of transcriptional regulators in PCa. Many stimuli
activate NF-κB, mostly through IκB kinase-dependent (IKK-dependent) phosphorylation
and subsequent degradation of inhibitor κB (IκB) protein.17-19 The degradation of IκB
occurs by the inhibitor of kappa kinase (IKK) complex20 which has two catalytic subunits,
IKKβ and IKKα, that regulate the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways,
respectively. The classical NF-κB pathway targets dimers composed of p65 (RelA), c-Rel,
and NF-κB1 (p50), which regulate transcription of diverse set of genes encoding cytokines,
growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (see review21,22).
The alternative NF-κB pathway depends on IKKα dimers that phosphorylate the NF-κB2
(p100) precursor protein, leading to degradation of its C-terminal half and release of its Nterminal portion, p52, that enters the nucleus as a dimer with RelB.23

Author Manuscript

Abundant data supports a key role for the NF-κB signaling pathway in controlling the
initiation and progression of human cancer.24-27 Many studies indicate that activation of NFκB signaling correlates with PCa progression, including chemoresistance, advanced stage,
PSA recurrence, metastatic spread, and growth of PCa in bone.6,28-35 NF-κB is shown to the
third most activated pathway out of >100 pathways in metastatic34 and in primary PCa
where it correlates with patient outcome,36 also supported by previous reports.16,33,35,37
Further, multiple NF-κB binding sites in the AR promoter have been shown to increase
transcription of AR-FL.38 Previously, we and other researchers have confirmed that classical

NF-κB pathway plays a critical role in the progression of PCa to castrate resistant growth
and bone metastasis.38-40
However, detailed mechanism(s) by which NF-κB signaling contributes to CRPC
progression is still not fully understood. In this study, we report that activation of classical
NF-κB signaling induces the transcription of the AR splice variants in PCa cells and by
blocking NF-κB signaling we can restore CRPC responsiveness to anti-androgen treatment.
These results indicate that ARVs elevation by the activation of NF-κB signaling in PCa cells
is an important mechanism whereby tumors progress to CRPC. Further, NF-κB inhibition is
sufficient to restore responsiveness of CRPC to androgen blockade.

Full length AR (AR-FL) contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) encoded by exon 1, the
DBD (exon 2 and 3), a short hinge region (exon 4), and the C-terminal LBD encoded by
Exon 4-8,41 while ARVs lack the ability to bind androgens due to a lack off or a truncation
of the LBD. In order to investigate whether NF-κB signaling affects ARVs expression, we
designed two pairs of primers to specifically detect AR Exon 1 (Exon 1) and AR-FL. Exon 1
primers were used to detect both AR-FL and all ARVs; AR-FL primers were used to detect
AR-FL only. LNCaP is an androgen-dependent (AD) PCa cell, which has low levels of NFκB activity.40 NF-κB signaling in LNCaP cells was activated by infecting with IKK2-EE
retroviral vector (LNCaP-EE where EE contains constitutive active mutant of IKK2
resulting in activation the classical NF-κB pathway)42,43 (Figure 1A). The cells infected
with the empty vector (EV) were used as controls (LNCaP-EV). The results from real time
qRT-PCR showed that activation of NF-κB signaling increased both AR-FL and AR exon 1
expression (Figure 1B). However, the change of exon 1 expression is higher than that of
AR-FL (Figure 1B). In addition, activation of NF-κB signaling increased AR-V7 mRNA
expression significantly, which is one of the well-known ARVs and commonly expressed in
CRPC7 (Figure 1B). These result indicated activation of NF-κB signaling increase ARVs
expression in PCa cells. Western blot assay further confirmed that activation of NF-κB
signaling in LNCaP cells increased both AR-FL and ARVs expression (Figure 1C). This
result further confirmed by directly over expression of RelA (p65), a specific transcription
factor of the classical NF-κB pathway in LNCaP cells. The result from Western blot assay
showed that over expression of RelA increased AR-V7 significantly in LNCaP cells (Figure
1D). In contrast to LNCaP cells, C4-2B and 22RV1 cells are castrate resistant. In order to
further confirm our findings, NF-κB signaling in C4-2B and 22RV1 cells was inactivated by
infecting with IKK2-KD retroviral vector (which contains the kinase dead, KD, mutant of
IKK2).42,43 Consistent with our findings in LNCaP cells, inactivation of NF-κB signaling in
C4-2B and 22RV1 cells decreased ARVs expression in both cell lines (Figure 1E and F).
BMS345541 is a well-known specific inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. Treatment of PCa
cells with BMS345541 blocks NF-κB signaling efficiently in these cells (Supplemental
Figure 1). In order to confirm that NF-κB signaling elevates ARVs expression in PCa cells,
C4-2B and 22RV1 cells were treated with BMS345541. The results from real time qRTPCR showed that blocking of NF-κB signaling efficiently decreased AR-FL, AR exon 1 and

AR-V7 mRNA expression (Figure 2A and B). By western blot, detection of AR-FL and
ARVs proteins in 22RV1 cells is apparent (AR-FL ~ 110 kDa; ARVs ~ 75 kDa). Consistent
with the findings on AR-FL and ARVs mRNA by qRT-PCR, inactivation of NF-κB
signaling decreased AR-FL and ARVs expression in 22RV1 cells at the protein level (Figure
2C). This result was further confirmed by Western blot assay using an antibody that only
recognizes AR-V7 (Figure 2D). These findings indicate that activation of the classical NFκB pathway is an important mechanism by which the ARVs levels increase in advanced
CRPC. However, BMS345541 alone did not affect the proliferation rate significantly in
androgen independent C4-2B and 22RV1 cells in vitro (Figure 2E and F).
Blocking of NF-κB signaling increases the sensitivity of CRPC cells to the anti-androgen

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In order to determine if antagonizing NF-κB signaling effects the sensitivity of CRPC cells
to an anti-androgen, we generated NF-κB inactivated PCa cell lines by stably infecting with
IKK2-KD vectors (C4-2B-KD) (Supplemental Figure 2A). Although NF-κB blockade
slightly altered proliferation rates, the engineered cells grew well (survive) in vitro after
down regulation of NF-κB activity (Supplemental Figure 2B). NF-κB activated (C4-2B-EV;
infected with empty vector) and inactivated (C4-2B-KD) PCa cells were treated with
bicalutamide, an anti-androgen. As expected, control cells (C4-2B-EV), which have high
levels of NF-κB activity and express the ARVs, had a lower response to bicalutamide
(Figure 3A). However, the sensitivity of NF-κB inactivated C4-2B-KD cells to the
bicalutamide is increased significantly (Figure 3B). Conversely, activation of NF-κB
signaling reversed androgen-dependent LNCaP cells to become androgen-insensitive
(Figure 1A and 3C). These results indicate that activation of NF-κB signaling is sufficient to
cause progression of androgen dependent PCa cells to become castrate resistant; while,
blocking NF-κB signaling increase the sensitivity of CRPC cells to an anti-androgen.
Mechanistically, NF-κB controls the expression of the AR-FL and ARVs thereby
controlling the response to anti-androgens.
Inhibition of NF-κB signaling restores responsiveness of CRPC cells to anti-androgen
treatment

BMS345541, a specific inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, efficiently blocks NF-κB signaling
in PCa cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Unfortunately, BMS345541 is not suitable for clinical
use. Bortezomib is a FDA approved drug that is an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome complex
and blocks the degradation of IκB. Elevation of IκB, the NF-κB inhibitor, blocks NF-κB
signaling.44 Our studies show that bortezomib blocks NF-κB activity efficiently in both
C4-2B and 22RV1 CRPC cells (Supplemental Figure 3A and B). Since bortezomib is
clinically approved to treat cancer, we selected this agent to test whether inhibition of NFκB signaling would restore responsiveness of CRPC cells to the anti-androgen treatment.
First, we investigated bortezomib effect on AR-FL and ARVs expression in PCa cells. ARFL and ARVs expression was analyzed by real time qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The
results show that bortezomib decreases AR-FL and ARVs expression efficiently in PCa cells
at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4A, B, C and D). To test if bortezomib can
restore responsiveness of CRPC cells to the anti-androgen treatment, we treated C4-2B and
22RV1 cells with anti-androgen alone or combined it with bortezomib. As expected, the
anti-androgen (bicalutamide) or bortezomib alone had no significant effect on the growth

rate on CRPC C4-2B and 22RV1 cells (Figure 5A, B, C and D). However, when the cells
were treated with anti-androgen plus an antagonist of NF-κB signaling, the growth rate of
both C4-2B and 22RV1 cells was significantly inhibited (Figure 5E and F). These results
further demonstrate that blocking of NF-κB signaling decreases AR-FL and ARVs
expression and restores responsiveness of CRPC cells to the anti-androgen treatment.

In order to extend our in vitro results, we generated CRPC xenograft mouse models of
C4-2B or 22RV1 cells in male athymic nude mice. After the primary s.c. tumors reached 3-4
mm diameter, the mice were treated with bicalutamide, bortezomib or bicalutamide plus
bortezomib by IP injection. Control mice were treated with vehicle only. Tumor volume was
measured weekly, and the xenograft tissues were harvested 2 weeks after treatment for
analysis. After treatment with either bicalutamide or bortezomib alone, both of C4-2B and
22RV1 tumors continued to grow and there was no significant difference in the tumor size
compared to the control group (treated with vehicle) (Figure 6A and B). However, when the
mice were treated with bicalutamide combined with bortezomib, the tumor growth was
significantly inhibited in both C4-2B and 22RV1 bearing mice (p<0.05; Figure 6A and B).
Proliferation rates, NF-κB activity and ARVs expression of tumor cells in the xenograft
model were determined by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67, p65-pho and AR-V7
(Figure 6C and D). Our results showed that the number of the cancer cells stained by Ki67
in the tumor from mice treated with bicalutamide plus bortezomib was significantly lower (p
< 0.01) than that the mice treated with bicalutamide, bortezomib or vehicle alone (Figure
6C). In addition, bortezomib significantly inhibits p65-pho (p < 0.05) and AR-V7 (p <
0.001) expression in this xenograft model (Figure 6D). These results indicate that blocking
NF-κB signaling increases the sensitivity of CRPC tumor to the anti-androgen treatment.
Therefore, combination therapy that attacks both the androgen-AR axis and NF-κB pathway
can provide a new therapeutic approach against lethal CRPC.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

It is widely accepted that androgen receptor addition (ARA) can lead to the failure of ADT
and the emergence of CRPC. Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain
escape from ADT (such as AR amplification, modification of the AR by point mutations or
phosphorylation, and changes in AR co-activators), there is evidence that the ARVs are an
important driving force in developing CRPC.10,11,13-15 Despite initial success in treating
CRPC with the new generation of high affinity anti-androgens such as enzalutamide or
inhibitors of androgen synthesis such as abiraterone, patients still fail, within 4-5 months,
the drug therapy targeting AR action.2,3,45 Most recently, several studies demonstrated that
ARVs play a major role in the resistance to this new generation of inhibitors of AR
action.11,16,46 Therefore, understanding the mechanism of failure of therapy is critical to
develop new treatments against CRPC.

synaptophysin) is associated with poor prognosis.47-50 As the patients undergo treatment of
metastatic disease, there is an increase in NED and eventually with failure to ADT, small
cell carcinoma appears (NE cancer that has low levels of AR or is AR negative).51 We have
reported that Wnt-signaling induces NED in adenocarcinoma,52 a pathway that is now
recognized to be activated in advanced PCa.53 Previously, we have reported that
neuropeptides, such as bombesin (BBS) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), activates NFκB signaling in PCa cells, and neuropeptides released from NE cells cause LNCaP
xenografts to become castrate resistant by activating the classical NF-κB signaling and
increasing AR levels.39,54 Most recently, Nadiminty et al. reported that activation of the
non-canonical NF-κB pathway (NF-κB2/p52) enhances expression of ARVs thereby
contributing to resistance to anti-androgens in PCa cell lines.16 In this study, we demonstrate
that activation of NF-κB signaling plays a critical role in the expression of ARVs in PCa
cells and that blocking of NF-κB signaling down-regulates AR-FL and ARVs expression to
restore responsiveness of CRPC to anti-androgen treatment. Both overexpression of RelA
(p65) and constitutively active IKK2 mutants do not result in physiological levels of active
the NF-κB. However, this data still provides a fundamental explanation on how the
activation of the NF-κB pathway can control progression to CRPC by the induction of
ARVs. Our study shows that activation of NF-κB signaling increases ARVs expression at
both the mRNA and protein levels. It is reported that NF-κB binds to the AR promoter to
transcriptionally regulate gene expression.38 The rapid induction of ARVs expression in
LNCaP by NF-κB activation (within 24 hours) would suggest that NF-κB also regulation
splicing of the AR pre-mRNA. However, we do not have direct proof that NF-κB is
involved in spliceosome function. Our preclinical studies using human CRPC xenograft
models show that the combination of an anti-androgen and antagonist of NF-κB signaling is
sufficient to inhibit CRPC tumor growth. Taken together, these findings suggest that as NED
or small cell carcinoma occurs, signaling by neuropeptides activates the NF-κB pathway in
the adenocarcinoma to increase ARVs expression and failure to ADT. These findings have
important clinical implications by providing the mechanism whereby the tumor escapes
ADT and an approach for a new intervention to treat CRPC.

The results from previous phase I and II trials of bortezomib alone or in combination with
docetaxel showed limited antitumor activity in CRPC.55,56 This is consistent with our results
since it is the combination of ADT with the NF-κB targeted therapy that was effective
against CRPC xenografts. Under this combination, we see that blocking NF-κB signaling
down regulates the expression of both the AR-FL and the ARVs, while the anti-androgen
blocks the remaining low levels of androgen seen by the AR-FL. AR binds to DNA as a
dimer and it has been shown that AR-FL and ARVs dimer can drive CRPC.10 Our current
data demonstrates that blocking the AR axis or NF-κB signaling alone cannot inhibit CRPC
tumor growth efficiently; while, the combination of anti-androgen with NF-κB targeted
therapy inhibits CRPC tumor growth significantly in preclinical CRPC mouse models
(Figure 6). These results strongly support that combination of inhibiting both the AR axis
and NF-κB pathway can serve as an effective therapy against lethal CRPC. Recently, a
small clinical trial to test bortezomib in combination with ADT was reported for early stage
disease. Bortezomib plus hormone blockade for three months induced a rapid clinical
response that lasted 42 days longer (median time to progression) when compared to

hormone blockade alone. Progression was measured as a change in the slope of the PSA
rise.57 This clinical response was considered short lived and bortezomib was associated with
significant neural toxicity in the patients. Our studies indicate that the maximum benefit to a
patient would not occur in early stage disease but patients in the late stage of the disease that
are CRPC would benefit by combining the ADT with inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Our
studies suggest that blocking the expression of the NF-κB pathway during the late stages of
the disease when ARVs are extensively expressed would provide the maximum benefit in
combination with ADT. Clearly, agents that block NF-κB activity with minimal side effects
that can be used in combination with ADT for late stage CRPC would benefit the patients.

Author Manuscript

In summary, the data presented here indicates that activation of NF-κB signaling increases
ARVs expression in the PCa cells and blocking NF-κB signaling down-regulates ARVs
expression and restores responsiveness of CRPC cells to the anti-androgen treatment.
Combination of anti-androgen and NF-κB targeted therapy is a new approach to treat CRPC.

Whole cell lysate was extracted from NF-κB activated/inactivated PCa cells. A 20μg aliquot
(40-60μg for AR-V7 antibody) of each protein sample was separated on a 4 to 12% Trisglycine gradient gel (NOVEX™), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Schleicher & Schuell, Germany). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in
TBS-T (Trypsin buffered saline, 1% Tween-20) buffer. The AR (N20, Santa Criuz) and ARV7 (Precision) antibodies were added (AR, 1:1000; AR-V7, 1:200) and the blots were
incubated o/n in 4 C°. After washing three times for 10 minutes each in TBS-T, incubation
was performed for 1 hour with the secondary horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody. The signals were developed by an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences,

The NGL vector [a NF-κB responsive reporter vector which has Luciferase and Green
Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter genes]60 was used to measure NF-κB activity in the PCa
cancer cells by transient transfection experiments. Experimental cells were plated at an
initial density of 2.5 × 104/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. After 24 hours, the cells
were transfected with NGL vector using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for four hours
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was determined using the
Promega Corp luciferase assay system 24 hours after transfection or further treatment with
BMS345541 or bortezomib. The transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfecting
pRL-CMV containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Promega). The values plotted
represent the mean of at least three individual samples ± SD.

Experimental cells were plated in a 96-well plate (1 × 104/well). After 24 h, the cells were
treated with or without different combination of drugs (Bicalutamide, BMS345541 or
Bortezomib) in different concentration. MTT assay was performed at 24, 48, and 72 hours
after the cells had been treated with referenced drugs. All of the measurements were carried
out in triplicate.

with vehicle only. Tumor volume was measured weekly and calculated by the formula:
Volume = π/6 × W × H × L (mm3). After 2 weeks treatment, the xenograft tissues were
harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded for histologic and
immunohistochemical analyses. Each group had at least five mice. The results are reported
as the mean percent ± SD.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies
against Ki67 (clone TEC-3, DAKO), p65-pho (Abcam) and AR-V7 (Precision). The primary
antibody was incubated at the appropriate concentration (1:1000) for one hour at room
temperature. The secondary antibody was incubated for 60 minutes. Slides were rinsed
extensively in tap water, counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted. For
quantitation of the cell proliferation, the cells were counted as positive for Ki67 when
nuclear immunoreactivity was observed. Each tissue section was counted manually in three
different areas to assess the Ki67 positive cells index. The data were then presented as
number of Ki67 positive cells/400x microscope field. Expression of p65-pho and AR-V7
were measured by calculating the percentage of DAB-stained nuclear area over total nuclear

Figure 1. Activation of NF-κB signaling increases ARVs expression in PCa cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A) NF-κB signaling was activated in LNCaP cells by infecting with IKK2-EE retroviral
vector (LNCaP-EE). LNCaP cells infected with IKK2-EV (empty vector) (LNCaP-EV) were
used as controls. NF-κB activity was determined using NGL, a NF-κB reporter vector. B)
Three sets of primers were used to amplify wild-type AR (AR-FL), Exon 1 (which amplify
both wild-type AR and ARVs) and AR-V7, respectively. AR-FL and ARVs mRNA
expression were measured by qRT-PCR. Results are presented as means ± SD of 3
experiments performed in triplicate. C) Proteins expression of AR-FL (molecular weight is
110 kDa) and ARVs (molecular weight is 75 kDa) was measured by Western blot analysis
using AR N20 antibody. Blot signals were quantified using ImageJ program. Results were
normalized by TBA signals. D) NF-κB signaling was activated in LNCaP cells by infecting
with RelA expression vector (LNCaP-RelA). LNCaP cells infected with empty vector
(LNCaP-EV) were used as control. Protein expression of AR-V7 was measured by Western
blot analysis using AR-V7 antibody. Blot signals were quantified using ImageJ program.
Results were normalized by β-actin signals. NF-κB signaling was inactivated by infecting
with IKK2-KD retroviral vector in E) C4-2B (C4-2B-KC) and F) 22RV1 (22RV1-KD)
cells. Cells infected with IKK2-EV (C4-2B-EV, 22RV1-EV) were used as control. Three
sets of primers were used to amplify AR-FL, Exon 1 (which amplify both wild-type AR and
ARVs) and AR-V7, respectively. AR-FL and ARVs mRNA expression were measured by
qRT-PCR. Results are presented as means ± SD of 3 experiments each performed in
triplicate.

C4-2B cells were stably infected with IKK2-KD retroviral vector (C4-2B-KD), in which
NF-κB activity was inhibited with a kinase dead (KD) IKK2 mutant. The cells infected with
empty vector (EV) were used as controls leaving NF-κB signaling activated (C4-2B-EV).
Both A) C4-2B-EV and B) C4-2B-KD cells were treated with Bicalutamide (Bic). Cell
proliferation assay was performed at 48 hours after treatment. Results are presented as
means ± SD of 3 experiments performed in triplicate. C) NF-κB signaling activated
(LNCaP-EE) and inactivated (LNCaP-EV) LNCaP cells were treated with or without
androgen (DHT; 10−8M). Cell proliferation assay was performed at 72 hours after treatment.
Results are presented as means ± SD of 3 experiments performed in triplicate. **, P < 0.001

A) C4-2B and B) 22RV1 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 7-weekold male athymic nude mice. After the primary tumors reached 3-4 mm diameter, the mice
were treated with Bicalutamide (Bic: 20mg/kg in oil; 3 times/wk), Bortezomib (BZ: 1mg/kg
in DMSO; 3 times/wk) or Bicalutamide plus Bortezomib (Bic+BZ) by IP injection. Control
group mice (Con) were treated with vehicle only. Tumor volume was measured weekly and
calculated by the formula: Volume = π/6 × W × H × L (mm3). Results are presented as the
mean percentage change in tumor volume; bars, ± SD. *, P < 0.05 by Student’s t test,
compared with control. C) Immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 was performed to
determine cell proliferation in the tumors. Each tissue section was counted manually in three
different areas to assess the Ki67 positive cells index. The data were then presented as
number of Ki67 positive cells/400× microscope field. Results are presented as the means ±
SD. **, P < 0.001 by Student’s t test, compared with control. D) Immunohistochemical
staining of p65-pho and AR-V7 were performed to determine NF-κB activity and ARVs
expression in the tumors. Expression of p65-pho and AR-V7 were measured by calculating
the percentage of DAB-stained nuclear area over total nuclear area (labeling index) using
ImmunoRate program (lower panel). Results are presented as the means ± SD. **, P <
0.001; *, P < 0.05 by Student’s t test, compared with control.
