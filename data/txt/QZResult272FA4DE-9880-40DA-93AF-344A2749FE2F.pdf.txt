ABSTRACT
Although Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 antibody, benefits certain patients with
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, de novo or acquired trastuzumab resistance
remains a haunting issue. EGFRvIII, co-expressing with HER2 in some breast
tumors, indicates a poor clinical prognosis. However, the role of EGFRvIII in
the function of trastuzumab is not clear. Here, we demonstrated that EGFRvIII
overexpression contributed to de novo trastuzumab resistance and the feedback
activation of STAT3 caused by trastuzumab also resulted in acquired resistance in
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers. CH12, a highly effective anti-EGFRvIII monoclonal
antibody that preferentially binds to EGFRvIII, significantly suppressed the growth
of EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CH12 in
combination with trastuzumab had a synergistic inhibitory effect on EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancers in vitro and in vivo via attenuating the phosphorylation of EGFR and
HER2 and their downstream signal pathways more effectively and reversing STAT3
feedback activation. Moreover, the combination therapy suppressed angiogenesis and
induced cell apoptosis significantly. Together, these results suggested a synergistic
efficacy of the combination of trastuzumab with CH12 against EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast
cancers, which might be a potential clinical application in the future.

INTRODUCTION

containing therapies remains modest: ~26% when used as
a single therapy and 40-60% when used in combination
with systemic chemotherapy [5-8]. Many patients do
not respond to initial trastuzumab treatment (de novo
resistance), and many trastuzumab-responsive patients
develop resistance after continuous treatment (acquired
resistance) [9, 10]. Two major categories of trastuzumab
resistance mechanisms have been proposed: (I) De novo
resistance due to genetic alterations of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) and their downstream signaling targets,
such as aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway due
to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiency

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that regulates cell
growth and differentiation signaling pathways, is highly
overexpressed in approximately 20% to 25% of breast
cancers, leading to an aggressive tumor phenotype and
a dismal prognosis [1, 2]. Trastuzumab, a humanized
antibody targeting HER2, shows considerable clinical
efficacy and extends the overall survival of certain
patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer [35]. However, the overall response rate to trastuzumabwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or PIK3CA gene activating mutations [11, 12], and the
accumulation of truncated HER2 receptors (p95HER2)
that lack the trastuzumab-binding domain [13]; and
(II) acquired resistance primarily due to the acquisition
of alternative RTK or feedback signal activation that
compensate for HER2 inhibition after trastuzumab
treatment [14-16].
EGFR, an essential RTK, playing an vital role
in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival in
a number of human cancers, also contribute to both de
novo and acquired trastuzumab resistance [14, 17].
Accumulating reports have demonstrated that EGFRvIII,
the most common EGFR mutant forms with constitutively
activated kinase domain [18, 19], expresses in various
human cancers, including breast cancer, and it has not
been detected in normal adult human tissue [20, 21].
EGFRvIII expression was detected in approximately 5%
of primary breast cancer cases and contributes to cancer
stem cell phenotypes in invasive breast carcinomas [21].
Furthermore, approximately 40% of HER2-positive
primary breast tumors were found to co-express EGFRvIII,
and, even more striking, 75% of HER2-positive metastatic
lymph node specimens co-expressed EGFRvIII [22].
EGFRvIII is posited to be involved in
tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and metastasis in breast
cancers [22-24]. Several strategies against EGFRvIIIpositive tumors have been explored. For instance, antiEGFRvIII antibodies, such as mAb 806 and CH12, which
selectively bind to a cancer-specific epitope of EGFR
or EGFRvIII, have been demonstrated to be capable of
efficiently inhibiting the growth of EGFRvIII-positive
tumor xenografts [21, 25, 26]. However, it needs to be
determined whether these antibodies have efficacy against
breast tumors with EGFRvIII overexpression.
Considering the co-expression of HER2 and
EGFRvIII in breast cancers, we predicted that HER2
and EGFRvIII might cooperate for tumor growth, and
EGFRvIII expression might contribute to trastuzumab
resistance. However, to date, no treatment strategies
have been explored on EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers.
Therefore, in this study, we examined the combination
effect of trastuzumab and CH12 on the EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms
underlying their antitumor effects.

parental cells in vitro (Figure 1A). Furthermore, the
antitumor efficacy of trastuzumab in BT474-EGFRvIII
xenografts in nude mice was slightly weaker than that in
parental BT474 model (Figure 1B). The inhibition rate of
trastuzumab at a concentration of 2 mg/kg was 51% in
BT474-parental xenograft, while it was 43.7% in BT474EGFRvIII model (P < 0.01).
To determine the molecular mechanism underlying
EGFRvIII-mediated trastuzumab resistance, the
downstream signaling of EGFR was analyzed. In
EGFRvIII+HER2+ cell lines, ERK, AKT, Jak1 and STAT3,
were activated compared with EGFRvIII-HER2+ cell lines
(Figure 1C and 1D). After trastuzumab treatment, both
AKT and ERK phosphorylation were less downregulated
while Jak1 and STAT3 phosphorylation were unregulated
more obviously in EGFRvIII+HER2+ than in EGFRvIIIHER2+ cancer cell lines (Figure 1C and 1D). Together,
EGFRvIII overexpression might decrease the sensitivity
of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab via constitutively
activating EGFR downstream signals including ERK,
AKT, and Jak1/STAT3.

RESULTS

CH12 significantly suppressed the growth of
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers in vitro and in
vivo

EGFRvIII overexpression decreased
sensitivity of breast cancers to trastuzumab

STAT3 activation contributed to acquired
trastuzumab resistance in EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancer
To determine the role of STAT3 in trastuzumab
resistance in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers, the STAT3
inhibitor BP-1-102 was applied together with trastuzumab
to treat breast cancer cells. The results illustrated that the
combination of BP-1-102 and trastuzumab significantly
enhanced the antitumor effect of trastuzumab on BT474EGFRvIII and SKBR3-EGFRvIII (Figure 2A) cells. The
similar results were also observed in the combination
of STAT3 siRNA with trastuzumab (Figure S2). In
the combination group, STAT3 phosphorylation was
significantly inhibited, and nuclear translocation of STAT3
was obviously reduced (Figure 2B and 2C). Other EGFR
downstream signals activated constitutively by EGFRvIII
were not obviously affected (Figure 2B). These results
further demonstrated that STAT3 activation contributed to
trastuzumab resistance in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancer
cells.

To determine whether an EGFRvIII-targeted
strategy could be applied in breast cancer therapy, the
anti-EGFRvIII monoclonal antibody CH12 was applied
to treat EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancer cells. In vitro
growth inhibition effect of CH12 was examined. The
results shown in Figure 3A indicated that CH12 inhibited
the growth of BT474-EGFRvIII and SKBR3-EGFRvIII

The EGFRvIII encoding sequence was introduced
into the HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines BT474
and SKBR3, and the established EGFRvIII+HER2+ cells

cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antitumor effect
of CH12 was further evaluated in established BT474EGFRvIII tumor models. As shown in Figure 3B, CH12
significantly inhibited the growth of BT474-EGFRvIII
xenografts with an inhibition rate of 41% at a dose of 10
mg/kg and 74% at a dose of 25 mg/kg on day 35 after the
first administration (Figure 3B). Further study revealed
that CH12 could obviously inhibit phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT, Jak1 and STAT3 (Figure 3C and 3D).
Together, CH12 significantly suppressed the growth of
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers in vitro and in vivo via

inhibiting EGFR downstream signals.

Combination of trastuzumab with CH12
synergistically inhibited the growth of
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo
According to the efficacy of CH12 and the inhibition
effect against ERK, AKT and Jak1/STAT3 pathway in
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers, we wondered whether

treated by trastuzumab, CH12 and the combination were
69.6%, 68.6%, and 42.1% in BT474-EGFRvIII cells, and

the combination of trastuzumab with CH12 could reverse
trastuzumab resistance in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast
cancer. First, we determined the combination effect of

72.2%, 75.6% and 50.5% in SKBR3-EGFRvIII cells.
The results illustrated that the combination imposed
a synergetic growth-inhibition effect on both BT474EGFRvIII and SKBR3-EGFRvIII cells compared with
either antibody alone (P < 0.01, CDI < 1 in both model,
Figure 4A and 4B). To investigate the in vivo antitumor
effect of the combination of trastuzumab with CH12,
mice bearing BT474-EGFRvIII xenografts were treated
with trastuzumab, CH12 or the combination. All animals

tolerated the treatments well, without observable signs of
toxicity, and had stable body weights during the study.
The inhibitory ratios of trastuzumab, CH12 and the
combination on day 35 after first administration were
41%, 43%, and 69%, respectively (Figure 4C), which
suggested that tumor growth was synergistically inhibited
by the combination treatment (versus trastuzumab or
CH12 treatment alone, P < 0.01, CDI < 1). Tumor weight
was also measured at the end of the study (Figure 4D),

Taken together, these data indicated that the combination

activity in vitro and in vivo.

and STAT3 was also significantly inhibited compared
with the trastuzumab group (Figure 5A and 5B). Similar
changes of these molecules were also observed in the
BT474-EGFRvIII xenograft models (Figure S3).
STAT3 need to dimerize to transmit signals to
the nucleus and function as a transcription factor [32].
It was reported that the STAT3/HER2/HER3 complex
could translocate to the nucleus and promote cyclinD1
translation [33], which is a vital cell cycle regulator
for cell cycle progression in phase G1. Therefore, we
examined the nuclear translocation of HER2 and STAT3.
The results showed that combination treatment inhibited
their nuclear translocation (Figure 5B and 5C) and reduced
the expression of cyclin D1 (Figure 5A and 5B). Together,
the combination inhibited the AKT, ERK and Jak1/
STAT3 pathways more efficiently when compared with

To gain further insight into the molecular events
occurring in combination-treated cells, certain key
signaling molecules were examined via Western blot
analysis. The phosphorylation level of AKT and ERK in
the combination treatment cells was lower than those in
the monotherapy groups, and the phosphorylation of Jak1

and reduced the cyclin D1 expression.

approximately 50-60% of the primary breast tumors,
STAT3 has been reported constitutively activated
through phosphorylation by cytoplasmic non-receptor
tyrosine kinases [36, 37]. Accumulating evidence has
demonstrated that STAT3 activation is also associated
with drug resistance as a considerable feedback loop and
limits the efficacy of agents [38-40], such as various RTK
inhibitors [41]. Furthermore, it was reported that STAT3/
HER2/HER3 complex translocates to the nucleus and
promotes cyclinD1 translation, which is a major driver of
in trastuzumab resistance [32]. In this study, we revealed
that STAT3 inhibition significantly increased the antitumor
effect of trastuzumab on EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers
(Figure 2), implicating that STAT3 inhibitors might be
used to increase the antitumor effect of trastuzumab on
EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers..
Our previous data demonstrated that mab CH12
could selectively bind to EGFRvIII and significantly
suppress the growth of EGFRvIII-positive tumor
xenografts [26]. Here we demonstrated that CH12 had a
significant growth-suppression effect on EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancers in vitro and in vivo (Figure 3A and 3B) at
least partially through inhibiting the phosphorylation of
EGFR, AKT and STAT3 (Figure 3C and 3D). Thus, it
seems rational to combine CH12 and trastuzumab, which
have opposite role on STAT3 phosphorylation.
As we expected, CH12 in combination with
trastuzumab exhibited synergistic antitumor activity
in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers in vitro and in vivo
(Figure 4). The combination inhibited the ERK or AKT
pathway more efficiently and abrogated the feedback
activation of STAT3 caused by trastuzumab treatment.
Additionally, the combination lessened the nuclear
translocation of STAT3 and HER2 and reduced cyclin
D1 expression, leading to increased efficacy (Figure
5). Furthermore, compared with the monotherapy, the
combination treatment significantly suppressed tumor
proliferation and microvessel density while significantly
induced apoptosis (Figure 6). It has been reported that
STAT3 phosphorylation promotes angiogenesis various
cancer types including breast cancer and the expression
of angiogenic factor VEGF-A plays a vital role in STAT3induced angiogenesis [42-44]. In this study, VEGF-A
expression and the microvessel density in the combination
group reduced significantly than trastuzumab monotherapy
group (Figure 6C, 6D and 6G), indicating that antiangiogenesis played important role in the antitumor
activities of the combination treatment.
It is well known that the toxic side effects on
normal tissue present huge obstacles in cancer treatment
and lead to dose reductions, treatment delays, and
even the discontinuation of therapy. In this study, we
demonstrated that STAT3 inhibitor could increase the
antitumor activities of trastuzumab. However, STAT3
inhibitor could not distinguish the STAT3 in normal cells
and cancer cells and might cause severe side effects.

Combination of trastuzumab with CH12 potently
reduced proliferation and angiogenesis, and
induced apoptosis in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast
cancers
To further elucidate the causes underlying the in
vivo synergistic activity of trastuzumab and CH12, the
proliferative index, tumor microvessel density as well as
the apoptotic index was evaluated. The proliferative index
was significantly lower in the combination-treatment
group than the vehicle group as well as the monotherapy
groups (P < 0.05 monotherapy versus combination; Figure
6A and 6B).
The number of the CD34-positive microvessels in
the combination-treatment group was also significantly
less than that in the monotherapy groups (P < 0.05
monotherapy versus combination; Figure 6C and 6D).
VEGF-A expression in CH12 and combination group
abated significantly when compared with control and
trastuzumab group (P < 0.05, Figure 6G).
TUNEL staining demonstrated a significant increase
in the number of apoptotic cells in the combinationtreatment group compared with the monotherapy groups
(P < 0.01, Figure 6E and 6F). Consistently, cleaved
caspase 3 and cleaved PARP increased obviously while the
expression of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptosis protein reduced
significantly (Figure 6G). Together, these data showed that
trastuzumab and CH12 combination therapy had a stronger
effect on reducing tumor proliferation and angiogenesis
and inducing tumor cell apoptosis than monotherapy in
vivo, leading to synergistic tumor inhibition.

DISCUSSION
Although EGFRvIII has been demonstrated to coexpress with HER2 in breast cancer, its contribution to
the sensitivities of breast cancer against trastuzumab has
not been determined. Our study indicated that EGFRvIII
expression could decrease the sensitivity of breast cancer
cells against trastuzumab via activating the ERK, AKT and
Jak1/STAT3 pathways (Figure 1), which suggested that
EGFRvIII inhibitor might reduce trastuzumab resistance.
Intriguingly, we observed that the Jak1/STAT3
pathway was significantly activated in trastuzumabtreated EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancer cells. STAT3
is constitutively activated in many types of human
cancers, including breast cancer, and plays crucial roles
in regulating tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion,
and angiogenesis [32, 34]. STAT3 activation has also
been reported as a vital cause contributing to trastuzumab
resistance in HER2+ breast and gastric cancer [35]. In

In contrast, CH12 targets a cryptic epitope of EGFR or
EGFRvIII, which only exposes in tumor cells and not in
normal tissue, leading to a good safety profile. Clinically,
mab 806, which targets a similar epitope as CH12, was
well tolerated at all dose levels with generally predictable
and manageable minor toxicities being observed [45].
Thus, the combination of trastuzumab with CH12 might
show a larger safety window when compared with the
combination of trastuzumab with JAK1/STAT3 inhibitors.
In summary, EGFRvIII expression increased
the de novo resistance of breast cancer cells against
trastuzumab, and the feedback activation of STAT3
caused by trastuzumab also contributed to acquired
resistance in EGFRvIII+HER2+ breast cancers. Moreover,
the combination of trastuzumab and CH12 could
synergistically inhibit the growth of EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancer via attenuating phosphorylation ERK
and AKT more effectively and reversing STAT3
feedback activation. Taken together, we propose that the
combination of Trastuzumab and CH12 might be a novel
treatment strategy for the patients with EGFRvIII+HER2+
breast cancer.

by FACS cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics Altra,
Miami, FL).

RNA interference assay
STAT3
siRNA
(5’-AGUCAGGUUGCUGGUCAAA-3’) and negative
control siRNA (siN05815122147) were purchased from
Ribobio, Guangzhou, China [28]. The cells were plated
at 50% confluence, transfected with 50 nM siRNA
overnight in Opti-MEM containing Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), and incubated for various amounts of time.

In vitro cell proliferation assay
The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 5000 cells per well. After 24 hours, the cell media was
replaced with media containing trastuzumab or CH12
at different concentrations or PBS (vehicle), using five
wells per concentration. After 48 hours, cell proliferation
was measured using a CCK-8 kit (Dojindo Laboratories,
Rockville, MD). CCK-8 solution (10 μl) was added to 90
μl of culture media and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The optical density
was measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader. The
experiment was performed in triplicate at different times.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human breast cancer cells BT474 (HER2/ERpositive) and SKBR3 (HER2-positive/ER-negative) were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection. BT474
and SKBR3 with exogenous EGFRvIII overexpression
were established according to previously reported methods
[27]. All breast cancer cells were cultured in 1640 medium
(Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Serana, Australia) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Western blotting analysis
Protein lysates were obtained from BT474EGFRvIII and SKBR3-EGFRvIII cells using a lysis buffer
(Prod# 78501, Thermo, USA) with a protease inhibitor
cocktail. Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation
at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The tumor tissues were
surgically excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then
homogenized in tumor lysis buffer (Prod# 78510, Thermo,
USA); after centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at
4°C, the lysates were collected. The protein was quantified
using a BCA Kit (Prod# 23225, Thermo, USA), separated
on SDS-PAGE gels at 8%-14% polyacrylamide according
to protein weight and blotted onto a PVDF nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The membrane
was blocked in 5% milk in PBST for 1 hour and then
probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The
following primary antibodies were used: the phosphorHER2, HER2, phosphor-EGFR, EGFR, phosphor-ERK,

Reagents
Trastuzumab was purchased from Genentech, USA
and dissolved in PBS buffer at a concentration of 22 mg/
mL. The chimeric mAb CH12 (IgG1) was produced in
dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO DG44 cells as
described previously at 20 mg/mL [26].

FACS analysis
1×106 cells were collected by centrifugation and
incubated with 20 μg/mL primary antibody, in phosphatebuffered saline containing 1% newborn calf serum for
45 min at 4°C. After being washed with cold phosphatebuffered saline, cells were incubated for an additional 45
min at 4°C with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-human

for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBST
and then visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Prod#
34080, Thermo, USA).

number of microvessels per 0.74 mm2 (× 200 field).

TUNEL assay
The TUNEL assay was performed according to
kit instructions (Qia39, Merck, USA). The tumor tissues
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and incubated
with proteinase K (20 μg/mL) for 20 minutes at 37°C.
After several washes with TBS, the specimen was covered
in 1× equilibration buffer for 30 minutes, and the incubated
with a mixture of 57.0 µl of Fluorescein-FragELTM TdT
Labeling Reaction Mix and 3 µl of TdT Enzyme for 1.5
hours at 37°C in the dark. Then, the slides were rinsed in
TBS three times. A glass coverslips were mounted using
Fluorescein-FragELTM Mounting Media and slides were
visualized under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS
IX71, Japan). TUNEL-positive cells were counted at ×400
magnification. The apoptotic index was calculated as a
ratio of (apoptotic cell number) / (total cell number) in
each field.

Tumor xenograft studies
All mouse experiments were performed in
accordance with approved protocols from Shanghai
Medical Experimental Animal Care Commission. BT474EGFRvIII cells (1×10^7) in 100 µl of 1640-Matrigel
mixture (1:1 ratio) were injected subcutaneously in the
right lateral flank of 6-week-old nude mice. When the
tumor volumes reached an average of approximately
100 mm3, we treated the mice with vehicle control (three
times per week), trastuzumab (once per week), CH12
(three times per week) or trastuzumab-CH12 combination
intraperitoneally. Tumor volumes were measured every
five days in two dimensions with vernier calipers. The
tumor volumes were calculated using the following
formula: length × width2 × 0.5. Two weeks after the final
treatment, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were
surgically excised and weighed. Tumor tissues from the in
vivo experiments were collected for Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemical studies.

Evaluation of the combination effect
The coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) was used
to evaluate the combination effect. CDI is calculated in
in vitro CCK-8 assay as follows: CDI = AB/(A×B). AB
is the cell viability of combination group and A or B is
the cell viability of antibody monotherapy group. In in
vivo tumor xenograft model, end point tumor sizes were
analyzed for combination effect using the formula CDI =
(AB/C) / (A/C × B/C), where C is the tumor volume of
the vehicle group, A or B is the tumor volume of antibody
monotherapy group, and AB is the tumor volume of the
combination group. CDI value < 1, =1 or >1 indicates that
the combination is synergistic, additive or antagonistic,
respectively [30, 31].

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
To assess angiogenesis and cell proliferation in
tumors, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues
were immunostained using monoclonal antibodies antiCD34 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-Ki-67 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA). After deparaffinization and
rehydration, the tissue sections were incubated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous
peroxidase. The sections were blocked for 30 minutes
with 1% BSA and incubated with the primary antibodies
at 4°C overnight. As negative controls, staining was
performed in the absence of the primary antibodies. The
sections were then washed with PBS and incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for one hour. The
products were then visualized using a diaminobenzidine
staining kit (TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China) and
counterstained in hematoxylin.
As a measure of proliferation, the Ki-67 labeling
index was determined as the ratio of (labeled nuclei) /
(total nuclei) in high power fields (× 200). Approximately
2000 nuclei were counted in each case by systematic
random sampling.
Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by
measuring the number of stained microvessels in each
section from six mice of each group as described [29]. The
mean microvessel count of the six most vascular areas was
taken as the MVD, which was expressed as the absolute

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± SE or mean ±
SD. Statistical significance was determined by paired or
unpaired Student t test in cases of standardized expression
data. One-way ANOVA was performed for multiple group
comparisons and comparisons between two groups were
conducted using the least signiﬁcant difference method. P
< 0.05 was considered significant.
