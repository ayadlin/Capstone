onsider the following analyses involving previously published
data in the peer-reviewed medical literature comparing outcomes across 1) ovarian cancer trials and 2) retrospective institutional experiences in this malignancy:

Analysis 1
Several institutions have reported their individual data regarding
long-term (>5 years) risk for recurrence in patients with advanced
ovarian cancer who previously had achieved a surgically confirmed
complete response to primary chemotherapy.1–3 Table 1 shows that,
after cisplatin-based treatment, this rate exceeded 50%,1,2 whereas
for patients who received alkylating agent chemotherapy, the risk of
recurrence was <20% (even with follow-up >8 years).3 These data
would appear to support the conclusion that alkylating agent therapy is the superior primary chemotherapy strategy in advanced
ovarian cancer. Why is this class of antineoplastic agents not the
‘‘standard of care’’ in the management of the malignancy?4

Analysis 2
In a randomized Phase III trial that was conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) exploring the clinical utility of primary
platinum-based chemotherapy in large-volume, residual, advanced
ovarian cancer (stage IV disease and stage III disease with at least a
single residual tumor nodule >1 cm in maximum dimension), the
median progression-free and overall survival of patients who
received cisplatin plus paclitaxel were 14 months and 26 months,
respectively, which clearly was not different from the GOG experience in an identical patient population that received cisplatin plus
cyclophosphamide (Table 2).5,6 Based on this analysis, what was the
justification for the GOG, other cooperative groups, and practicing
oncologists to consider cisplatin plus paclitaxel the new ‘‘standard
of care’’ in this clinical setting?4

Analysis 3
Two independent investigative groups reported
objective response rates of >40% associated with the
administration of a cisplatin plus gemcitabine combination chemotherapy regimen to a group of
patients with ovarian cancer who were defined by
the researchers as having platinum-resistant disease
(Table 3).7,8 It is noteworthy that previously published Phase II and Phase III trials that involved multiple antineoplastic agents delivered in this setting
have revealed objective response rates of <20%.9,10
One interpretation of the cisplatin plus gemcitabine
data is that they represent a substantial improvement
in activity compared with alternative programs in
this clinical setting.
Although the specific ‘‘facts’’ in the 3 ‘‘analyses’’
presented above are stated accurately, the profoundly
flawed conclusions result from inappropriate comparisons made between patient populations outside
the setting of a well-designed, prospective, randomized trial. Now, consider the following ‘‘reanalyses’’
of each of the 3 scenarios.
Reanalysis 1
The stated recurrence rates noted in Table 1 after
platinum-based and alkylating agent therapy reflect
the observed institutional experiences with these
agents.1–3 However, they do not represent an appropriate evaluation of patients who received the specific
regimens that differed only in the drugs employed.

‘‘Standard’’ cisplatin-based treatment generally has
included from 5 to 8 months of drug delivery with a
second-look surgical evaluation (if this management
approach is employed) performed approximately 1 or
2 months after the completion of chemotherapy.5,11
In sharp contrast, in the past, patients who were
administered alkylating agent-based therapy who did
not experience disease progression typically received
the drug for 18 months before surgical reassessment was undertaken (Table 4),3,12 Thus, during this
more prolonged observation phase, a far larger proportion of individuals with persistent disease had the
opportunity to exhibit biologic progression that
became clinically evident or that, at least, was of sufficient quantity/volume to become detectable (e.g.,
biopsy-positive, second-look procedure) in contrast
to the much shorter time interval from diagnosis to
the second surgery associated with cisplatin treatment. Consequently, the overall smaller numbers of
patients who had a ‘‘negative’’ reassessment after
alkylating agent chemotherapy (both because of the
inferiority of nonplatinum-based regimens13,14 and
because of the timing of the evaluation3,12) appeared
to have a superior ultimate prognosis. It is highly
likely (although only actual data can address the
issue definitively) that, if second-look surgeries were
performed routinely in platinum-treated ovarian cancer patients from 18 to 24 months after the initiation
of primary chemotherapy, then those individuals
found to be ‘‘without documented disease’’ would

experience a similarly low risk of recurrence (from
that point onward), as noted in the alkylating agenttreated population.

Reanalysis 2
The analysis (Table 2), although it involved the management of patients by the same group of gynecologic oncologists employing identical eligibility
criteria, represents a cross-trial comparison of populations treated with the 2 chemotherapy programs on
consecutive GOG studies (cisplatin/cyclophosphamide on GOG 111 and cisplatin/paclitaxel on GOG
132).5,6 In fact, the actual differences between the 2
regimens in progression-free survival (P < .001) and
overall survival (P < .001) within the same trial (Table
5) were substantial5 and led (along with the results
of a second Phase III randomized study15) to an
appropriate change in the management paradigm for
advanced ovarian cancer.4 What caused the major
difference between the outcomes associated with the
same cisplatin/paclitaxel study regimens in the 2 studies, in what appear to be ‘‘identical’’ entry criteria for
the consecutive trials? Although it is not possible to
provide a definitive answer to this provocative question, it is logical to assume that there were unanticipated and unappreciated differences in the patient
populations that participated in the 2 specific trials.
One hypothesis is that the legitimate concern for
‘‘sudden death’’ and ‘‘severe cardiac toxicity’’ that
surrounded the very early experience with paclitaxel
led to a relative decrease in participation in the initial randomized trial of women with clinically relevant comorbidities in addition to known cardiac
dysfunction (which was an exclusion criteria for the
trial).16,17 When this Phase III study revealed the absence of serious cardiac events5 and it became clear
that paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity was a
manageable drug-related toxicity, it is possible that
the subsequent trial (with the lower survival in the
paclitaxel-containing arm) included women with a

spectrum of comorbid conditions that were not evident (at least in the same proportion) in the first
study and that had a negative influence on the outcome.6 It is important to state again that this is only
a hypothesis and nothing more.

Reanalysis 3
It is well recognized in oncology that the objective
response rates in small Phase II, antineoplastic drug
studies frequently are not replicated when the identical regimens are examined in multicenter, randomized
trials.18 Differences in the extent of disease and prior
therapy, location and size of the tumor(s), the presence or absence of significant comorbidity, and the
criteria employed for determining a response all may
play an important role in this common observation.
Thus, it should not come as a surprise to learn that,
when the GOG conducted its own Phase II trial of the
combination of cisplatin plus gemcitabine in platinumresistant ovarian cancer, the observed objective response rate was substantially lower than that noted
in the noncooperative group setting19 and was within
the range reported for agent-single agent gemcitabine20,21 and other cytotoxic agents employed in this
clinical setting (Table 6).9,10
This commentary has not been written to suggest that an examination of differences in outcomes
between individual trials or institutional experiences
is always without merit. On the contrary, such efforts
may lead to provocative hypotheses that subsequently may result in the initiation of prospective,
randomized, Phase III studies. For example, the
rather prolonged survival of a subset of women with
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who were treated
with single-agent paclitaxel on a National Cancer
Institute-sponsored Phase II trial, compared with an
‘‘expected outcome’’ that was suggested by historic
data in this clinical setting,22 led to the development
of a Phase III study exploring this agent as a ‘‘maintenance’’ strategy in patients with advanced ovarian
cancer.23

However, it is absolutely critical that the substantial limitations (this type of analysis can be only hypothesis-generating) and inherent dangers (profoundly
inappropriate claims for the validity of the results of
such comparisons) of this academic exercise be understood clearly. Furthermore, an appreciation for the importance of this issue must be shared by journal
editors, peer-reviewers, and all who attempt to evaluate the objectivity and relevance of articles that appear
in the oncology literature. Finally, it is essential that
the education and mentoring of our clinical (and clinical research) trainees include thorough discussions
regarding the fundamental concerns associated with
‘‘cross-trial’’ and ‘‘cross-retrospective experience’’ comparisons as well as the potential role of such efforts in
the generation of novel hypotheses to be tested in
future, well-considered investigative initiatives.
