ACVR1 Mutations in DIPG: Lessons Learned from FOP
Kathryn R. Taylor1,2, Maria Vinci1,2, Alex N. Bullock3, and Chris Jones1,2

Abstract
Whole-genome sequencing studies have recently identiﬁed a quarter of cases of the rare childhood brainstem
tumor diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma to harbor somatic mutations in ACVR1. This gene encodes the type I bone
morphogenic protein receptor ALK2, with the residues affected identical to those that, when mutated in the
germline, give rise to the congenital malformation syndrome ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva (FOP),
resulting in the transformation of soft tissue into bone. This unexpected link points toward the importance
of developmental biology processes in tumorigenesis and provides an extensive experience in mechanistic
understanding and drug development hard-won by FOP researchers to pediatric neurooncology. Here, we review
the literature in both ﬁelds and identify potential areas for collaboration and rapid advancement for patients of
both diseases. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4565–70. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Recent sequencing of the whole genome or coding regions
(exome) of cancer cells has provided an unprecedented level of
insight into the biologic processes underlying the development
of numerous tumor types (1, 2). Such approaches have shown
a remarkable ability to spring surprises, few more so than in
the ﬁeld of pediatric neurooncology. Numerous childhood
brain tumors have been found to be driven by a diverse series
of unexpected genetic and epigenetic processes, which differ
substantively from adult cancers, with medulloblastoma (3–5),
ependymoma (6, 7), and glioma (8, 9) now known to comprise
a varied series of subentities deﬁned by age, anatomic location,
and biology. These insights likely reﬂect unique origins of these
tumors and highlight the important interface of developmental
biology and cancer. Here, we discuss a novel link between these
processes suggested by the remarkable discovery of mutations
present somatically in a subset of lethal childhood brainstem
tumors, which when found in the germline give rise to a rare
congenital malformation syndrome of soft tissue. What can
cancer researchers studying diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
(DIPG) learn from the experience of the ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva ﬁeld?
DIPG
Although considerably less frequent than histologically similar lesions occurring in adults, high-grade gliomas in children
represent a major unmet need in clinical neurooncology (10).

tumors linked to anatomic location and age of incidence (11),
and marked by speciﬁc gene mutations (8), has strengthened
the contention from earlier molecular proﬁling studies (12)
that they harbor unique biology and disease origin (13). An
unusual high-grade glioma variant restricted to the pediatric
setting is DIPG, a brainstem lesion arising in the ventral pons at
a peak age of incidence of 6 to 7 years (Fig. 1A). These tumors
are universally fatal, with a median overall survival of 9 to 12
months (10). DIPGs are diffusely inﬁltrating, and although may
harbor regions of lower-grade histology, are largely indistinguishable from World Health Organization grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) of the cerebral cortex. Efforts to
improve survival in these children have thus far failed—surgical resection of these tumors is not possible due to their
anatomic location and clinical trials based upon promising
targets from the adult GBM literature have shown no beneﬁt
(14).
To improve this dismal situation, efforts have focused on
collecting tumor material for detailed molecular analysis. In
Europe, the reintroduction of stereotactic biopsy procedures in
typical DIPG cases has been pioneered with low morbidity and
mortality (15). Elsewhere, rapid autopsy protocols have been
opened to obtain tumor material postmortem (16), as review
boards have been reluctant to allow biopsies in all but atypical
cases due to the requirement only for imaging and a short
clinical history for the diagnosis of DIPG (17). Use of such
material has provided evidence for distinct DNA copy number
and gene expression proﬁles of DIPG compared with nonbrainstem pediatric and adult GBM (18, 19), and more recently,
the identiﬁcation of highly recurrent and selective mutation in
genes encoding the histone variants H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1
(HIST1H3B; ref. 9). These mutations were initially found in 60%
and 18% of cases, respectively, and resulted in an amino acid
substitution conferring a change of lysine to methionine at
position 27 on the histone tail (K27M). Remarkably, such
mutations have not been identiﬁed in any other cancer type,
but are also found in approximately 50% of thalamic GBM
(8, 11), an anatomic location generally restricted to children,

ACVR1 in FOP and DIPG

hinting at a common origin of these tumors and DIPG.
Although targeting only one of the many genes encoding
histone H3 proteins, the mutation exerts a powerful transdominant negative on cellular H3K27 trimethylation (20), a
posttranslational modiﬁcation that usually binds the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to repress gene transcription. K27M-mutant tumors consequently have distinct gene
expression patterns (21) and global hypomethylation (22), in
addition to a restricted age of onset and poor clinical outcome
(23). Although this mutation clearly represents a fundamental
genetic driver in DIPG, it is currently unclear how to directly
target K27M tumors therapeutically.
Recently, four independent studies have been published
that apply whole-genome or -exome sequencing to a collectively large series of DIPG biopsy and autopsy specimens, and
that have begun to shed light on the wider genetic background
against which these H3 K27M mutations are found, providing
novel targets for desperately needed treatments. These data,
from groups in Paris/London (24), Toronto/Duke (25), St. Jude
(26), and Montreal/Boston (27), comprise data from a total of
195 DIPGs, representing a remarkable series of collaborative
efforts worldwide in this rare disease. Common themes to
emerge from these studies include a relatively low mutation
rate for such an aggressive tumor (0.8–0.9 mutations per
megabase; refs. 24, 26), recurrent alterations in the PI3K
(40%–68% cases) and p53 pathways (57–76% cases), and a
prevalence of mutations in genes encoding chromatin modiﬁers (26%–30% cases; refs. 24–27).
Most strikingly, however, was the unexpected identiﬁcation
of the most recurrently mutated gene in DIPG after the histone
variants, ACVR1. This gene, encoding the receptor serine/
threonine kinase ALK2, was found to harbor nonsynonymous
heterozygous somatic mutations in 46 of 195 (24%) cases at ﬁve
speciﬁc residues (24–27; Fig. 1B). Patients harboring ACVR1
mutations were predominantly female (approximately 2:1) and
had a younger age of onset (approximately 5 years) and longer
overall survival time (approximately 15 months) compared
with wild-type tumors (24, 26, 27). ACVR1 mutations also
strongly cosegregated with K27M mutations in the gene
encoding histone H3.1 (HIST1H3B), which themselves are now
reported to represent an accumulated 22% of DIPG (24–27).
These tumors were also largely TP53 wild-type (90%) and
harbored additional alterations in the PI3K pathway (56%;
refs. 24–27). The speciﬁc base changes in ACVR1 conferred
seven different amino acid substitutions, namely R206H (9/46,
20%), Q207E (1/46, 2%), R258G (6/46, 13%), G328E (11/46, 24%),
G328V (13/46, 28%), G328W (2/46, 4%), and G356D (4/46, 9%;
refs. 24–27). These mutations are located in the glycine-serinerich (GS; R206H, Q207E) or protein kinase (R258G, G328E/V/W,

G356D) domains, with more than half (26/46, 57%) occurring at
the glycine at position 328. These mutations seem to be
remarkably speciﬁc for DIPG—the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database (28) version 68 lists only 18 conﬁrmed
somatic ACVR1 mutations in 9,170 tumors (0.2%), with only a
single amino acid substitution in common with DIPG (a case of
hepatocellular carcinoma with G328V). It is worth noting,
however, a further series of three endometrial carcinomas
with R206H mutations for whom no matched normal DNA
sequence was available. These speciﬁc alterations are important, as most remarkably of all, the somatic mutations
observed in DIPG are the same as those found in the germline
of patients with the congenital malformation syndrome ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva (FOP).
FOP
FOP is an autosomal dominant disorder of skeletal malformation and disabling heterotopic ossiﬁcation (Fig. 1A) that
arises in 1 in 1,500,000 live births due to sporadic germline
mutations in ACVR1 (29). All ﬁve sites of mutation newly
described in DIPG are also found in cases of FOP, as well as
a further ﬁve sites across the GS and kinase domains of the
encoded ALK2 protein (Fig. 1B; refs. 30, 31). Some 95% of FOP
cases harbor the recurrent GS domain mutation R206H
(c.617G>A), in contrast to the high proportion of ALK2 kinase
domain mutations in DIPG (31). Perhaps as a result of this bias,
two speciﬁc amino acid substitutions found in DIPG samples,
R258G and G328V, have yet to be observed in patients with
FOP (24–27).
Classical cases of FOP harboring the R206H mutation may be
diagnosed at birth by a signature malformation of the great
toes (31). Ectopic bone formation in muscle, tendons, and
ligament is typically observed by 5 years and progresses to
restrict joint movement, such that most individuals are conﬁned to a wheelchair by their third decade of life (31). Episodic
ﬂare-ups are additionally precipitated by soft tissue injury, viral
infection, and inﬂammation, which induce painful localized
swellings that may resolve or harden into bone (31). Tissue
metamorphosis ﬁrst involves the catabolism of soft tissue
before an anabolic phase involving the differentiation of osteogenic progenitor cells. Unfortunately, ﬂare-ups in children are
too often misdiagnosed as malignancy, resulting in harmful
surgery and devastating postoperative ossiﬁcation. FOP may
ultimately become life threatening in middle age due to
thoracic insufﬁciency (31).
All FOP-associated mutations activate the canonical bone
morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway to varying degrees to
promote osteogenic differentiation and endochondral bone
formation (30). BMP ligands belonging to the TGFb

FOP (blue), DIPG (red), or both diseases (purple) are labeled. C, cartoon representing a simpliﬁed BMP/ALK2 signaling pathway. ALK2 is a type I BMP
receptor that dimerizes, and upon ligand binding, forms a heteromeric complex with two type II receptors (e.g., BMPRII), which themselves phosphorylate the
ALK2 GS domain. Mutations (yellow stars) in either the GS or kinase domains inhibit interactions with the negative regulator FKBP12 and enhance recruitment
and phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8. Both types of mutation therefore confer constitutive pathway activation as evidenced by increased expression
of transcriptional targets of the SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD4 complex in the nucleus. Small molecules such as dorsomorphin and LDN-193189 may be
useful therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting the activation of this pathway. ACVR1 mutations cosegregate in DIPG with histone H3.1 K27M mutations,
which enhance transcription via disruption of trimethylated lysine 27 interactions with the repressive PRC2 complex. This derepression of gene
expression may include common targets with SMAD signaling, including ID1 and ID2.

superfamily bind to heteromeric complexes containing two
type II receptors and two type I receptors (32). Type II receptors
in this complex activate the type I receptors by phosphorylating their intracellular GS domain, which in turn allows the type
I receptors to recruit and phosphorylate the substrate proteins
SMAD1/5/8 (Fig. 1C; ref. 32). These receptor-associated SMADs
then assemble with SMAD4 and migrate to the nucleus where
they bind the promoters of BMP target genes, including ID1–3,
SMAD6, SMAD7, SNAIL, and HEY1 (32). The crystal structure of
the GS and kinase domains of ALK2 in complex with the
inhibitory protein FKBP12 shows that the disease mutations
will break critical side chain interactions that normally stabilize the inactive conformation of the kinase domain (30). The
mutant type I receptor therefore partially escapes the normal
mechanisms of regulation by FKBP12 and becomes weakly
active in the absence of ligand (30). This activation seems
sufﬁcient to drive endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
potentially explaining the origin of progenitor cells in FOP
lesions with a Tie2þ lineage (33). Furthermore, an Acvr1R206H/þ
knock-in mouse displays classical FOP demonstrating that this
single mutation is the causative factor (34).
In contrast to FOP, the assessment of the functional significance of ACVR1 in the context of DIPG has thus far been
limited (24–27). The early consensus is of these somatic
mutations conferring, to varying degrees, a weakly activated
BMP signaling pathway, as assessed by transfecting normal
human astrocytes and cultures derived from patients with
DIPG in vitro, with evidence for increased levels of phosphoSMAD1/5/8 and ID1/ID2 mRNA expression (24–27). It is
reported that ACVR1 mutant-transduced Tp53-null mouse
astrocytes reimplanted to the mouse pons failed to produce
tumors in vivo, suggesting that the additional genetic aberrations found in the human disease (e.g., H3.1 K27M, PI3K) may
be required for gliomagenesis (26). Importantly, there seem to
be no reported cases of DIPG in patients with FOP, although
numerous neurologic symptoms such as neuropathic pain are
observed (35), as well as imaging lesions that are linked to
dysmyelination and delayed oligodendroglial commitment,
seen in both patients and ACVR1 R206H mouse models (36).
Hints at a direct oncogenic role are provided by evidence of
ACVR1 mutations conferring an enhanced proliferative capacity (25), and selective ALK2 inhibitors reducing cell viability
in vitro (24). The speciﬁc association of ACVR1 with mutations
in histone H3.1, rather than H3.3, seems to point to the likely
differing neurodevelopmental contexts from which these
tumors arise. BMPs play a crucial role in brain development
(37), and BMP signaling in the context of neural stem cells plays
an important role in stem cell maintenance and cell fate and is
known to drive progenitor cells toward an astrocytic differentiation (38). DIPGs with predominantly astrocytic features are
reported to have an extended survival compared with the
remaining subgroup with pronounced oligodendroglial differentiation (19), and this seems likely to be driven by activated
BMP signaling via ACVR1 mutation. Indeed in adult glioblastoma, BMPs have been suggested to act as a prodifferentiation
regulator of tumor-initiating, stem-like cells (39). It remains
unclear whether the modest pathway activation observed in
DIPG cells is playing a similar role in these tumors, or whether

4568

noncanonical roles for these mutations can be found in the
context of cancer development.
Targeting ACVR1 in FOP and DIPG
There is a desperate need for effective treatments to
manage both FOP and DIPG. Surgery is precluded for both
conditions, and therapeutic antibodies seem unsuitable as
the activating mutations found in ALK2 affect only the
cytoplasmic portion of the receptor. Much effort has therefore focused on small-molecule inhibitors that can target the
intracellular kinase activity of the rogue ALK2 protein. The
most advanced kinase inhibitors, including DMH1, ML347,
LDN-193189, and LDN-212854, share the pyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidine scaffold of dorsomorphin, which was ﬁrst
identiﬁed as a BMP inhibitor by a phenotypic screen in
zebraﬁsh (40) and later cocrystallized as an ATP-mimetic
inhibitor of ALK2 (30). These compounds target the BMP
receptors ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 in the low nanomolar
range to inhibit SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation, without affecting the type I TGFb receptor ALK5 and the SMAD2/3
pathway. The 5-quinoline–substituted compound LDN212854 shows additional selectivity for ALK2 over other
BMP receptors and also inhibits heterotopic ossiﬁcation in
mice at a twice daily intraperitoneal dose of 6 mg/kg (41).
Improvements in selectivity against the wider kinome
have also been observed in a new inhibitor class based on
the 2-aminopyridine scaffold of K02288 (42). Further preclinical development of both compound series is required to
identify ALK2 inhibitors suitable for trials in humans. As a
proof of principle, speciﬁc silencing of the mutant ACVR1
c.617A allele has also been demonstrated in FOP patient cell
lines using allele-speciﬁc siRNA (43).
Other molecular targets may also hold promise for FOP.
Retinoic acid receptor g agonists inhibit chondrogenesis and
thereby block heterotopic bone formation in animal models
(44). Similar efﬁcacy has also been achieved in mice using the
tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, RP-67580, suggesting a
disease dependence on the neuroinﬂammatory factor substance P (45). Indeed, prednisolone and NSAIDs are the current
standard care for FOP to mitigate swelling during ﬂare-ups.
Whether ﬂare-ups spontaneously resolve or ossify remains
unpredictable. Therefore, precise natural history studies are
also required in the population of patients with FOP to provide
a statistical measure of drug efﬁcacy.
Despite the head start afforded by the progress made in FOP,
several challenges need to be overcome to move forward with
ALK2 inhibitors in DIPG. The ﬁrst and arguably most critical is
to develop small molecules with sufﬁcient central nervous
system (CNS) penetration to reach potentially effective doses
in these brainstem tumors. Although GBMs frequently show
evidence of a disrupted blood–brain barrier, delivery to the pons
may represent an additional hurdle, and DIPGs seem to have a
relatively intact vasculature (14). With current ALK2 inhibitors
lacking the chemical indicators of efﬁcient CNS penetration,
novel medicinal chemistry approaches may be necessary to
produce a DIPG-speciﬁc compound, although speciﬁc models
mimicking the blood–brain–tumor barrier in humans are currently lacking. Alternative forms of administration such as

ACVR1 in FOP and DIPG

convection-enhanced delivery (46) may be required to take
advantage of existing chemical series, and clinical trials using
this technique in DIPG are still ongoing.
An additional complication is associated with the complicated genetic background present in DIPG compared with the
monogenic nature of FOP. The limited in vitro preclinical work
in DIPG cells has shown only modest sensitivity to ALK2
inhibitors as single agents (24), and combinatorial approaches
additionally targeting other cosegregating somatic alterations
such as H3.1 K27M mutations and PI3K activation (24–27) will
likely be required. Even then, the inherent intratumoral heterogeneity of DIPG represents a major obstacle to targeted
therapy due to the subclonal diversity of these tumors providing the substrate for clonal selection and development of
resistance according to evolutionary biology principles (47).
Despite these caveats, there remains optimism that a more
thorough understanding of the underlying biology of these
tumors afforded by genome-wide proﬁling will provide clinicians with an enhanced armamentarium of drugs with which
to combat these tumors. Owing to the continued dire clinical
outcome of children with DIPG, there are signiﬁcant opportunities for rapid testing of promising approaches within ﬁrstline clinical trials, though the rarity of the disease will necessitate a coordinated, collaborative approach. With ACVR1mutant tumors representing around 25% of DIPGs, predictive
biomarkers will be key in guiding patients to the most suitable
therapy. There is evidence of pathway activation even in the
absence of ACVR1 mutation in DIPG (24–27), possibly expanding the patient population who may beneﬁt from ALK2 inhibitors, but also complicating patient stratiﬁcation. For all
potential predictive markers, routine biopsies will likely need
to be reintroduced to select patients who will most likely
beneﬁt from novel agents, a further challenge for the pediatric
neurooncology community, which the unexpected identiﬁcation of ACVR1 mutations may help to overcome.

Conclusions
It is becoming increasingly apparent that pediatric brain
tumors have their origins during neurodevelopment and that
cross-disciplinary approaches will be necessary to fully understand and leverage the wealth of data from whole-genome
sequencing studies into improved outcomes for these patients.
The surprising link between the seemingly unrelated diseases
of DIPG and FOP suggested by common mutations in ACVR1
represents a unique opportunity for collaboration between
researchers in disparate ﬁelds to fast-track drug development
for both entities. Although each disease has its own requirements and obstacles, we ought to be optimistic that our shared
experiences, insights, and approaches can lead to synergies in
tackling the desperate unmet clinical needs of two groups of
children.
