WEE1 Inhibition Alleviates Resistance to Immune Attack of
Tumor Cells Undergoing Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition
Duane H. Hamilton, Bruce Huang, Romaine I. Fernando, Kwong-Yok Tsang, and Claudia Palena

Abstract
Aberrant expression of the T-box transcription factor brachyury in human carcinomas drives the phenomenon
of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a phenotypic modulation that facilitates tumor dissemination and
resistance to conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. By generating isogenic cancer
cell lines with various levels of brachyury expression, we demonstrate that high levels of brachyury also
signiﬁcantly reduce the susceptibility of cancer cells to lysis by both antigen-speciﬁc T cells and natural killer
cells. Our results indicated that resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to immune-mediated attack was due to
inefﬁcient caspase-dependent apoptosis, manifested as inefﬁcient nuclear lamin degradation in the presence of
activated effector caspases. We correlated this phenomenon with loss of cell-cycle–dependent kinase 1 (CDK1),
which mediates lamin phosphorylation. In support of a causal connection, pretreatment of tumor cells with a
speciﬁc inhibitor of WEE1, a negative regulator kinase of CDK1, could counter the defective apoptosis of tumor
cells expressing high levels of brachyury. Thus, our ﬁndings suggested that reconstituting CDK1 activity to
threshold levels may be sufﬁcient to restore immunosurveillance of mesenchymal-like cancer cells that have
escaped previous immune detection or eradication. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2510–9. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The progression of carcinomas remains a poorly understood
phenomenon. A recently recognized mechanism involved in
tumor metastasis is the epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a phenotypic modulation that promotes the loss of
tumor epithelial features and the simultaneous acquisition of
mesenchymal-associated traits, including tumor motility and
invasiveness (1, 2). In addition to promoting metastasis, EMT
has also been associated with the acquisition of resistance to
cell death (3), a characteristic that may favor the survival of
mesenchymal cancer cells not only as they disseminate from
the primary tumor, but also in response to chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and some small-molecule–targeted therapies (4,
5). As a result, cancer therapies may select for tumor cells
undergoing EMT, a phenomenon ﬁrst demonstrated in vivo
with breast cancer recurrences (6).
Our laboratory has characterized the T-box transcription
factor brachyury as a driver of EMT in human carcinoma cells
(7, 8). We have shown that various types of tumors overexpress
brachyury (8, 9) and that its levels of expression positively

correlate with resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy (10,
11). We also demonstrated that circulating, brachyury-speciﬁc
cytotoxic CD8þ T cells (CTL) can be detected in the blood of
patients with carcinoma (12, 13), an observation that led us to
propose a T-cell–based immunotherapeutic approach, rather
than conventional therapies, as a means to speciﬁcally target
tumor cells undergoing brachyury-mediated EMT.
In recent years the role of the immune system in tumor
eradication and prognosis has gained increased recognition
(14, 15) and immune evasion is now included as an "emerging
hallmark of cancer" (16). To date, however, it is not clearly
understood whether EMT contributes to the escape of tumors
from host immunosurveillance and immune-mediated rejection. In the present study, human carcinoma cells undergoing
EMT via brachyury overexpression were compared with their
epithelial counterparts in terms of their susceptibility to
immune-mediated attack. Our results demonstrate that high
levels of brachyury reduce the susceptibility of carcinoma cells
to either antigen-speciﬁc, CD8þ CTLs or innate natural killer
(NK), and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells by decreasing the contribution to cell death of caspase-dependent pathways, while leaving unaffected the caspase-independent tumor
cytolysis involving perforin. Analysis of apoptotic markers
showed that resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to caspase-mediated cell death is due to the absence of nuclear lamin
degradation in the presence of normal levels of activated
effector caspases, a defect that seems to be related to the loss
of the cell-cycle–dependent kinase 1 (CDK1, also known as
p34cdc2), a kinase involved in lamin phosphorylation and
subsequent caspase-mediated lysis (17, 18). Pretreatment of
tumor cells with a speciﬁc inhibitor of WEE1, a negative
regulator kinase of CDK1, was shown to fully counter the

Tumor Loss of CDK1 Drives Immune Escape

defective apoptosis of tumor cells with high levels of brachyury in vitro, therefore indicating that reconstitution of
CDK1 activity to a threshold level may be sufﬁcient to improve
immune-mediated attack of mesenchymal-like, brachyuryhigh tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Immune effector cells
Peripheral blood from healthy donors and patients with
cancer was obtained under the appropriate Institutional
Review Board approval and informed consent. Antigen-speciﬁc, HLA-A2–restricted CTLs were expanded from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three different patients
with cancer using the following HLA-A2–binding peptides as
previously described: brachyury, WLLPGTSTL (12); mucin-1
(MUC1), ALWGQDVTSV (19); and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA), YLSGADLNL (20). Brieﬂy, dendritic cells (DC) were
prepared from PBMCs by culture in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony–stimulating factor and interleukin
(IL)-4, subsequently pulsed with the corresponding peptides
and used to stimulate autologous T cells in vitro. CD8þ T cells
were isolated with a magnetic CD8þ Isolation Kit (Miltenyi
Biotech). Murine H-2Kb–restricted gp70-speciﬁc CTLs were
established as previously described against peptide p15e604,
KSPWFTTL (21). NK cells were isolated from healthy donor
PBMCs by using a magnetic NK Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi
Biotech). For generation of LAK cells, puriﬁed NK cells were
incubated overnight in RPMI media supplemented with 10%
human AB sera and 2,000 U/mL of recombinant human IL-2.
Cell culture
The following human carcinoma cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection: pancreatic PANC1; lung A549 and H460; breast MDA-MB-231; and colon SW480.
Cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling.
Expression vectors and transfection strategies were previously
described (7). Silencing of CDK1 expression was achieved by
using an ON-TARGET SMARTpool siRNA; control cells were
transfected with a nontargeting siRNA pool as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Cells were
used 48 hours posttransfection.
Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described
(12). To inhibit the function of perforin/granzyme, NK or T cells
were preincubated with 200 nmol/L concanamycin A (CMA;
Sigma) for 2 hours at 37 C. Caspase-dependent lysis was
inhibited by preincubating target cells with 50 mmol/L
Z-VAD-FMK (Calbiochem) for 1 hour before the assay. Where
indicated, apoptosis was initiated by cross-linking of the FAS
receptor (CD95) with 12.5 mg/mL anti-CD95 (clone DX2)
antibody (BD Pharmingen) and 0.5 mg/mL protein G (GE
Healthcare) or incubation with 250 ng/mL of a recombinant,
active multimeric Superkiller TRAIL (Enzo Life Sciences).
When indicated, tumor cells were treated with 100 nmol/L of
the WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 (ChemieTeck) for 72 hours before
the assay.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
RNA isolation and real-time PCR assays were performed as
previously described (7) utilizing the probes (Applied Biosystems) listed in Supplementary Table S1. Expression of
CEA and gp70 mRNA was analyzed by PCR using a Titanium
Taq PCR Kit (Clontech) with 50 ng cDNA using CEA or gp70speciﬁc primers as listed in Supplementary Table S1. PCR
products were quantiﬁed with an Agilent Bioanalizer (Agilent
Technologies).
Western blot analysis
Commercial lysates from human lung and breast tumor
biopsies were purchased from Imgenex. The following antibodies were used: pan-actin (clone Ab-5; Neo Markers), b-2
microglobulin (b2M; clone BBM.1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
caspase-8 (clone Ab-3; Calbiochem), brachyury, lamin B1,
lamin A/C (Abcam), and CDK1 and caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology). Where indicated, protein lysates were run on a
7% acrylamide gel supplemented with 25 mmol/L Phos-Tag
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries), following the manufacture's
recommendations. All Western blots were imaged and quantiﬁed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR
Biotechnology).
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry
Carcinoma cells were grown on coverslips and stained as
previously described (7) with monoclonal antibodies recognizing CDK1 (Cell Signaling Technology), brachyury (Abcam),
and MUC1 (clone DF3; 1/50 dilution). Where indicated, tumor
cells were incubated with LAK cells at 37 C for 1 hour, and
stained for F-actin utilizing Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin as per
the manufacturer's recommendations. Images were captured
utilizing a Leica Fluorescent microscope. Confocal images
were obtained utilizing a Zeiss LSM 510 META Confocal
Microscope.
Lung tumor tissue arrays were purchased from US Biomax,
Inc. Sections of parafﬁn-embedded, formalin-ﬁxed tissues were
tested with a brachyury (Abcam) or a CDK1 antibody (EMD
Millipore) as previously described (9), and counterstained with
hematoxylin.
Murine studies
All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Experimental studies were
carried out under approval of the NIH Intramural Animal
Care and Use Committee. Murine colon carcinoma MC38
cells were stably transfected with an empty vector (pCMV) or
a brachyury-encoding (pBr) vector as previously described
(22). Tumor cells (5  105 MC38-pCMV or MC38-pBr) were
subcutaneously implanted into female C57BL/6 mice on day
0. Beginning on day 4, animals were vaccinated weekly with
either Hank's Balanced Salt Solution or 50 mg of a gp70
peptide (p15e) emulsiﬁed in Montanide ISA-51-VG (Seppic)
at a 1:1 ratio. Where indicated, gp70-speciﬁc T cells were
admixed with either 5  105 MC38-pCMV or MC38-pBr cells
at a 2:1 ratio of effector cells to tumor cells and subcutaneously implanted into female C57BL/6 mice.

Results
Brachyury expression associates with resistance to
immune-mediated lysis
To investigate whether brachyury-mediated EMT could induce resistance to immune-mediated killing, an isogenic tumor cell pair was generated by stably transfecting pancreatic
PANC-1 cells, characterized by low endogenous levels of brachyury, with a control vector (pCMV) or a vector encoding the
full-length human brachyury protein (designated hereafter as
pBr; Fig. 1A). Tumor lysis was evaluated using an HLA-A2–
restricted brachyury-speciﬁc CTL line established against an
epitope of the brachyury protein as previously described (12).

As shown in Fig. 1A, the cytotoxic lysis of PANC-1–pBr cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that of control PANC-1–
pCMV cells, despite of greater levels of the target brachyury
being expressed by the PANC-1–pBr cells. Impaired tumor lysis
was also observed with human CTLs directed against an HLAA2–restricted epitope of the tumor antigen MUC1 (19). As
shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of MUC1 were not decreased as a
result of brachyury overexpression, yet the PANC-1–pBr cells
were lysed less efﬁciently than PANC-1–pCMV cells at all
effector-to-target cell ratios evaluated. Comparable results
were obtained with breast MDA-MB-231 cancer cells that
exhibited decreased MUC1-speciﬁc T-cell lysis after brachyury
overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S1A), or with PANC-1 cells
induced into a mesenchymal phenotype by treatment with the
EMT inducer TGF-b (Supplementary Fig. S1B), compared with
their epithelial cell counterparts.
Loss-of-function experiments were also conducted to examine the impact of reducing brachyury expression on the

Tumor Loss of CDK1 Drives Immune Escape

susceptibility of colon SW480 carcinoma cells to immunemediated cytotoxicity. Although brachyury silencing, indicated
as Br short hairpin RNA (shRNA; Fig. 1C), had no signiﬁcant
impact on the level of expression of the tumor-associated
antigen CEA (Fig. 1C), the susceptibility of SW480 cells to lysis
by HLA-A2–restricted CEA-speciﬁc CTLs generated as previously described from the blood of a patient with cancer (20)
was greatly enhanced (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that, at
high levels of expression, brachyury might impair T-cell–mediated lysis regardless of the antigen speciﬁcity of the effector T
cells.
Defective lysis of brachyury-high tumor cells is not due to
defective antigen presentation
A well-recognized mechanism of tumor resistance to
antigen-speciﬁc T-cell lysis is the downregulation of components of the antigen-presentation and/or -processing
machinery. The PANC-1 tumor cell pair showed no differences about the levels of MHC class I or b2M (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Brachyury-high tumor cells also
demonstrated a signiﬁcant enhancement, rather than a
reduction, in the expression of various components of the
class I antigen-presentation machinery, including TAP1 and
TAP2, tapasin, and the proteasome subunits LMP2 and
LMP7 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, the defective
lysis of PANC-1–pBr cells by MUC1-speciﬁc CTLs was not
reversed when antigen presentation was fully bypassed via
the addition of exogenous MUC1 versus control HIV peptide
(Fig. 1D). On the basis of these results, it was evident that the
reduced lysis of tumor cells with high levels of brachyury was
not due to inefﬁcient antigen presentation. This conclusion
was further reinforced by the observation that reduced
susceptibility of brachyury-high tumor cells to immunemediated lysis was not restricted to antigen-speciﬁc T cells
but also observed with antigen-nonspeciﬁc LAK cells. As
shown in Fig. 1E, LAK-mediated lysis of A459–pBr cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that of A549–pCMV
cells, even if a stable engagement between the effectors
(LAK) and the tumor cells occurred, irrespective of the level
of brachyury, as demonstrated by equivalent polar actin
polymerization observed at the interacting surface area
(arrows, Fig. 1E). Similar results were observed with the
PANC-1 tumor cell pair (not shown).
Degradation of nuclear lamins is defective in brachyuryhigh tumor cells
To understand the mechanism(s) involved in the resistance
of brachyury-high cells to immune-mediated attack, lysis of
tumor cells following engagement of the immune-related,
surface-associated death receptors FAS and TRAIL-R was ﬁrst
evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2A, brachyury overexpression
induced a profound resistance to FAS and TRAIL-mediated
lysis in PANC-1 cells, whereas stable silencing of brachyury
signiﬁcantly enhanced the susceptibility of SW480 cells to both
apoptotic triggers (Fig. 2B). This resistance was not related to
the level of expression of functional or decoy FAS and TRAIL
receptors (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E), neither was
associated with the expression of FAS-associated phospha-

tase-1 (FAP-1; Supplementary Fig. S2F), a protein previously
reported to be involved in the attenuation of FAS-mediated cell
death (23).
The association of brachyury with resistance to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was further investigated with three
single-cell–derived populations of the PANC-1–pBr cell line
(designated as PANC-1–pBr clones Hi, Int, and Lo), characterized by high, intermediate, and low levels of brachyury
expression, respectively (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, a
strong inverse correlation was observed between the level of
brachyury and the susceptibility of the tumor cells to TRAILmediated lysis (r ¼ 0.999). Unexpectedly, the degree of
cleavage of both the initiator caspase-8 and the effector
caspase-3 was equivalent among the clones, regardless of the
level of brachyury expression (Fig. 2E). The degradation of
nuclear lamins, however, was markedly different among the
clones. As shown in Fig. 2F, cleavage of lamin B1 and, to a
lower extent lamin A/C, was profoundly defective in tumor
cells with high levels of brachyury (PANC-1–pBr clone Hi),
compared with that observed in the brachyury-low clone
(PANC-1–pBr clone Lo).

Defective lysis of brachyury-high cells associates with
loss of CDK1 and can be restored by WEE1 inhibition
Previous reports have demonstrated that lamin phosphorylation is a required step for degradation of the nuclear lamina
to take place during mitosis and apoptosis (18). We, therefore,
hypothesized that inadequate lamin phosphorylation in brachyury-high tumor cells could be responsible, at least in part,
for the inefﬁcient degradation of the nuclear lamins, even in the
presence of normal levels of activated effector caspases. As
shown in Fig. 3A, TRAIL treatment of tumor cells with low
levels of brachyury (PANC-1–pBr clone Lo) resulted in efﬁcient
phosphorylation and concurrent cleavage of lamin B1, an effect

that was not observed in the brachyury-high clone (PANC-1–
pBr clone Hi).
One of the kinases known to be involved with the phosphorylation of nuclear lamins is the CDK1 (24). Western blot
analysis of CDK1 expression in the single-cell clonal populations of PANC-1–pBr (Fig. 3B) demonstrated a strong inverse
correlation between the levels of brachyury and CDK1 protein
(r ¼ 0.909). Additional immunoﬂuorescence and Western
blot analyses conducted with the PANC-1 tumor cell pair
corroborated the marked reduction of CDK1 protein in brachyury-high tumor cells (Fig. 3C). This decrease in CDK1
protein was not associated with changes in mRNA levels
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), but instead with a marked reduction
of CDK1 protein stability, as demonstrated by the rapid
degradation of CDK1 in brachyury-high cells (PANC-1–pBr
and H460 Con shRNA) as compared with brachyury-low cells
(PANC-1–pCMV and H460 Br shRNA, respectively, Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. S3B).
The role of CDK1 loss in the acquisition of resistance of
brachyury-high tumor cells to immune-mediated attack was
further investigated by evaluating the impact of CDK1 silencing on the susceptibility of the tumor to lysis by NK cells. As
shown in Fig. 4A, silencing of CDK1 led to a signiﬁcant
reduction in the susceptibility of A549 cells to NK-mediated
lysis. As this effect was not seen with tumor cells pretreated
with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, the results suggested that reduced levels of CDK1 impair caspase-dependent
apoptosis. In additional experiments, CDK1 was overexpressed
in tumor cells with high levels of brachyury (H460-pCDK1), a
manipulation that resulted in enhanced NK-mediated lysis,
compared with control H460-pCMV cells (Fig. 4B).
On the basis of the above results, we postulated that tumor
sensitization to immune-mediated attack could be achieved by
restoring the activity of remaining CDK1 protein to an adequate level for efﬁcient nuclear apoptosis to proceed. The
approach was investigated by inhibiting the WEE1 kinase, a
cell-cycle kinase that negatively regulates CDK1 activity. As
demonstrated in Fig. 4C, pretreatment of PANC-1–pBr tumor
cells with MK-1775, a WEE1-speciﬁc small-molecule inhibitor,
was sufﬁcient to fully reconstitute the lysis of PANC-1–pBr
clone Hi cells to the levels observed with the PANC-1–pBr clone
Lo. We observed similar results in the ability of MK-1775 to
restore the lysis of A549–pBr to levels comparable with A549–
pCMV cells in response to NK- and TRAIL-mediated cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S4). As expected, pretreatment with MK1775 was associated with increased phosphorylation of
laminB1 in PANC-1–pBr clone Hi cells treated with TRAIL
(Fig. 4D).
Expression of brachyury and CDK1 in tumor tissues
The expression of brachyury and CDK1 protein was compared by Western blot analysis in commercial protein lysates
derived from lung (cases 1–7) and breast (cases 8–10) primary
carcinoma tissues. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was an inverse
correlation (r ¼  0.779) between the level of brachyury
expression and that of CDK1 protein in lung tumor tissues.
A trend was also observed in two of three breast cancer tissues
evaluated (Fig. 5B) that showed low levels of CDK1 expression

in correspondence with high levels of brachyury. Additional
lung cancer tissues were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the expression of brachyury and CDK1 protein.
As shown in Fig. 5C, an inverse correspondence between the
levels of brachyury and those of CDK1 could be observed in four
of six lung carcinomas evaluated.
Differential effect of brachyury on caspase-dependent
versus perforin-dependent tumor lysis
Immune effector cells have the capacity to kill target cells in
absence of caspase activation through the perforin-dependent
actions of granzymes. In light of the impact of brachyury
expression on the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, we
investigated whether high brachyury levels could also impair
perforin-dependent lytic pathways. These studies were performed with two PANC-1–pBr clones (clone Hi vs. Lo with high
vs. low levels of brachyury, respectively) that were left untreated or pretreated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
before the assay. Effector cells used in these assays were NK
cells that were left untreated or pretreated with CMA before
the assay, a manipulation that ablates perforin-dependent lysis
of the target cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, single blockade of
caspase activity signiﬁcantly reduced the lysis of the PANC-1–
pBr clone Lo but had no effect on the lysis of the PANC-1–pBr
Hi clone. In contrast, blockade of perforin-dependent lysis via
CMA treatment was able to signiﬁcantly reduce the lysis of the
PANC-1–pBr Hi but not that of the PANC-1–pBr Lo clone.
Combined blockade of caspases and perforin activity, as
expected, markedly reduced the lysis of both tumor cell lines.
These results indicated that tumor cells with low levels of
brachyury could be efﬁciently lysed after triggering of caspase-

dependent pathways whereas lysis of tumor cells with high
levels of brachyury seems to be exclusively dependent on the
involvement of the perforin-mediated pathway.
Tumor cells with high brachyury escape immune attack
in vivo
To investigate whether high levels of brachyury expression
would drive tumor resistance to effector lysis in vivo, the
murine colon carcinoma cell line MC38 was stably transfected
with a control vector (MC38-pCMV) or a vector encoding the
full-length brachyury protein (MC38-pBr; Fig. 6B). Similarly to
our observations with human carcinoma cells, overexpression
of brachyury in MC38 cells concomitantly decreased the levels
of CDK1 protein (Fig. 6B) without affecting the expression of
gp70, the envelope protein of an endogenous murine retrovirus
previously described as a tumor antigen in the MC38 model
(21). The effect of brachyury overexpression on tumor lysis by
gp70-speciﬁc CTLs was then evaluated in vitro. As shown in Fig.
6C, gp70-speciﬁc CTLs were able to lyse MC38–pBr cells less
efﬁciently than control MC38–pCMV cells at all effector-totarget ratios used and, in agreement with the results with
human carcinoma cells, the defective lysis of MC38–pBr cells
was more pronounced after ablation of perforin-mediated
cytotoxicity. To test whether brachyury could also induce
resistance to immune effector cells in vivo, gp70-speciﬁc CTLs
were admixed in vitro at a ratio of 2:1 with MC38–pBr or MC38–
pCMV tumor cells and subsequently injected subcutaneously
into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. As shown in Fig. 6D, gp70speciﬁc T cells were efﬁcient at preventing growth of
MC38–pCMV cells (tumors failed to grow in 3/3 mice) but
failed to control the growth of MC38–pBr tumors in 3 of 3

animals. In additional experiments, MC38–pBr and MC38–
pCMV cells were implanted subcutaneously in the ﬂank of
C57BL/6 mice. Four days after tumor implantation, mice were
vaccinated with a gp70 peptide or saline admixed with adjuvant Montanide; vaccines were weekly administered for a total
of 3 weeks. As shown in Fig. 6E, gp70 vaccination was able to
reduce (although not statistically signiﬁcant) the growth of
MC38–pCMV but not that of MC38–pBr tumors, compared
with the corresponding control groups. These observations are
in agreement with a report by Kudo-Saito and colleagues (25)
that demonstrated that B16 melanoma cells overexpressing
snail were resistant to the antitumor effect of intratumoral
injection of DCs pulsed with the gp70 peptide, as compared
with parental B16 cells.

Discussion
The activation of the EMT program in tumors has been
proposed as a mechanism by which cancer cells bearing a
mesenchymal-like phenotype may survive conventional antineoplastic interventions. The studies reported here indicate
that acquisition of a mesenchymal-like phenotype via expres-

2516

Cancer Res; 74(9) May 1, 2014

sion of high levels of the EMT regulator brachyury could also
mediate resistance to immune-mediated attack, potentially
contributing to tumor ignorance and failure of immune rejection of human tumor cells.
In recent years, numerous tumor antigens have been identiﬁed and antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell immune responses
have been detected in the blood of patients with cancer and in
lymphocytic inﬁltrates of multiple types of tumors (15, 26).
The acquisition of immune evasion mechanisms, however,
allows cancer cells to grow and metastasize despite of the
presence of a measurable antitumor immune response (27,
28). Defects in the antigen-processing and/or -presentation
machinery, including decreased expression of HLA molecules
and reduced levels of tumor antigens are well-recognized
mechanisms of immune evasion. These phenomena, however,
cannot explain all instances of immunologic resistance.
Reports are now starting to implicate the phenomenon of
EMT in tumor resistance to CTL-mediated lysis; Akalay and
colleagues (29), for example, recently demonstrated that EMT
might induce resistance to CTL lysis through the induction of
autophagy. In this report, we have extended the understanding of the role of EMT in tumor resistance to immune attack
by showing that brachyury decreases the ability of antigenspeciﬁc T cells to lyse tumor cells in the presence of effective
levels of MHC, antigen or the various components of the
antigen presentation machinery. Interestingly, tumor cells
with high levels of brachyury showed an upregulation, rather
than a downregulation, of the immunoproteosome subunits
LMP2 and LMP7. This phenomenon, which is commonly seen
in cellular responses to stress, may lead to enhanced generation and presentation of MHC class I antigenic epitopes.
Thus, deﬁcient antigen presentation can be ruled out as the
mechanism of resistance of brachyury-high cells. Furthermore, we show that the impairment of immune effector–
mediated lysis of brachyury-high cells could also be observed
during antigen-independent cytotoxicity mediated by NK or
LAK cells.
The results from this study indicate that the poor killing
associated with high levels of brachyury is mainly due to
inefﬁcient caspase-dependent apoptotic death, and not with
perforin-mediated lysis involving granzymes. Previous studies
have investigated the mechanisms by which other EMT transcription factors could drive resistance to cell death. For
example, the overexpression of snail has been shown to impair
apoptosis in response to TNF-a by decreasing the activity of
initiator caspase-8 and effector caspase-3 (3). Contrasting with
those studies, the resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to
caspase-mediated cell death takes place in the presence of
normal levels of fully activated effector caspases. Instead, the
major apoptotic defect identiﬁed here is the absence of degradation of nuclear lamins. The nuclear lamina is a protein
mesh formed by the intermediate ﬁlament lamins A-type
(lamins A and C) and B-type (lamins B1, B2; ref. 30), closely
associated with the inner nuclear membrane and the chromatin. In addition to playing a key role in maintaining the
nuclear envelope integrity and nuclear architecture, disassembly of the lamina is a required step during mitosis as well as
for the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis (18). We

Tumor Loss of CDK1 Drives Immune Escape

demonstrate here a profound reduction in CDK1 levels in
brachyury-high tumor cells, which, in turn, results in deﬁcient
lamin phosphorylation and defective degradation by effector
caspases (31). Although the mechanism involved in the reduction of CDK1 protein in brachyury-high cells has not been
investigated here, we have previously shown that brachyury
expression reduces the levels of the cell-cycle regulator p21
(10), which, in turn, could promote the assembly and stabilization of cyclin B1/CDK1 kinase at the G2–M transition (32).
The WEE1 kinase inactivates CDK1 by phosphorylating
Tyr15 (33). Previous reports have indicated a role for WEE1
in the decreased response of breast cancer cells to TRAILmediated apoptosis (34) or the resistance to radiotherapy in
various types of tumor cells (35). Currently, a speciﬁc inhibitor
of WEE1 is being tested in Phase II clinical trials for solid
tumors in combination with chemotherapy. Our results demonstrate that WEE1 blockade by MK-1775 is able to fully revert
the resistance of brachyury-high tumor cells to caspase-dependent cell death induced by TRAIL, NK, or LAK effector cells.
This observed reconstitution of susceptibility to cell death is
presumably achieved by restoring threshold levels of activated
CDK1 in brachyury-high cells, which might then allow for
the proper phosphorylation of lamins and their subsequent

targeting for degradation by activated caspases (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To date, there is no clear understanding of what factors
dictate the cytolytic mechanisms used by CTLs to kill tumor
cells, either in vivo or in vitro. A study with murine renal
carcinoma cells, for example, has shown that tumors that
present low levels of MHC class I–associated antigens to the
effector T cells are preferentially lysed by the FasL pathway,
whereas at high levels of peptide the CTLs lose their preference
for effector pathway usage (36). We demonstrate here that
efﬁcient lysis of brachyury-high tumor cells could only be
achieved by effector cells capable of lysing via the granule/
perforin pathway. This observation is consistent with the idea
that during perforin-dependent apoptosis, granzymes A and B
have been shown to directly cleave the nuclear lamins, thus
being able to promote the disruption of the nuclear membrane
even in the absence of proper lamin phosphorylation (37).
A phase I clinical trial of a recombinant yeast–brachyury
vaccine (22) is currently ongoing in patients with advanced
tumors (38). This vaccine is aimed at inducing a brachyuryspeciﬁc T-cell immune response that could eliminate tumor
cells undergoing brachyury-mediated EMT. The results from
this study indicate that the effectiveness of an immune

response against tumor cells that express high levels of brachyury could be further enhanced by (i) reconstituting caspasedependent cell death via inactivation of the WEE1 kinase, or (ii)
by downregulating the expression of brachyury, which paradoxically can increase the susceptibility of the tumor to
brachyury-speciﬁc (and other tumor-speciﬁc) T cells elicited
by vaccination of patients with a brachyury-based vaccine.
Although paradoxical, this strategy would allow for an alleviation of resistance mechanisms mediated by brachyury, and
improve tumor lysis even in the presence of lower levels of the
target antigen.
