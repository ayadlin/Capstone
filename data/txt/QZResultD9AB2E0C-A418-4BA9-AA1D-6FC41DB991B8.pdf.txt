ABSTRACT
Our previous study showed that administering oxaliplatin as first-line
chemotherapy increased ERCC1 and DPD levels in liver colorectal cancers (CRCs)
metastases. Second, whether the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab alters
tumoral VEGFA levels is unknown. We conducted this multicenter observational study
to validate our previous findings on ERCC1 and DPD, and clarify the response of

VEGFA expression to bavacizumab administration. 346 CRC patients with liver metastases
were enrolled at 22 Japanese institutes. Resected liver metastases were available for 175
patients previously treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy group)
and 171 receiving no previous chemotherapy (non-chemotherapy group). ERCC1, DPYD,
and VEGFA mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR. ERCC1 mRNA expression
was significantly higher in the chemotherapy group than in the non-chemotherapy group
(P = 0.033), and were significantly correlated (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.42;
P < 0.0001). VEGFA expression level was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab (n =
51) than in those who did not (n = 251) (P = 0.007). This study confirmed that first-line
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy increases ERCC1 and DPYD expression levels, potentially
enhancing chemosensitivity to subsequent therapy. We also found that bevacizumab
induces VEGFA expression in tumor cells, suggesting a biologic rationale for extending
bevacizumab treatment beyond first progression.

INTRODUCTION

maintaining VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab has proven
a clinically beneficial adjunct to standard second-line
chemotherapy.[14-18] However, the biological rationale of
continuing bevacizumab beyond first progression remains
elusive. Given that circulating levels of short vascular
endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoforms and
genetic variants of VEGFA or its receptors are promising
biomarker candidates for bevacizumab,[19] we propose
that investigating the VEGFA expression levels before
and after first-line bevacizumab treatment may help to
elucidate this rationale.
The present multicenter observational study of 346
CRC patients validates our previous findings that ERCC1
and DPYD expression levels are altered by oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy. We also evaluate the response of
VEGFA expression levels to bevacizumab administration.

Acquired resistance to chemotherapy and
molecular-targeted therapy of human cancers is mediated
by molecular alterations. Thus, understanding these
alterations is increasingly important for predicting
whether a patient will respond to chemotherapy and for
counteracting resistance to anticancer agents.
The standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimen
for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a combination
of fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid with oxaliplatin
(i.e., FOLFOX) or irinotecan (i.e., FOLFIRI) with or
without targeted agents.[1-3] Additionally, several
second-line therapy regimes have been proposed for
patients with recurring or progressive disease.[4-8] In a
randomized phase II/III FIRIS study, IRIS (irinotecan/S-1)
and FOLFIRI (5-FU–leucovorin/irinotecan) treatments
yielded similar outcomes.[9, 10] Interestingly, this study
reported a longer overall survival of patients in the IRIS
group, previously undertaking oxaliplatin-containing
chemotherapy, than patients in the FOLFIRI group.
However, the reason for this remains poorly understood
at the molecular level. To clarify the relevant molecular
mechanisms, we previously conducted a single-center
retrospective study of 45 CRC tissues. We found that
administering oxaliplatin as first-line chemotherapy to
CRC patients with liver metastases enhanced the patients’
expression levels of two important genes: excision repair
cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1, a nucleotide
excision repair pathway gene) and dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPYD, a pyrimidine catabolic pathway
gene). We thus hypothesized that IRIS regimens combined
with the DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine S-1 would
be more effective against DPD-high tumors than the
FOLFIRI regime.[11] However, our previous study was
limited by a relatively small number of patients sourced
from a single institute.
Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody commonly included
in first-line therapy of metastatic CRC.[12, 13] Once
disease has progressed beyond first line chemotherapy,

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the
study patients. The mean patient age at the time of
liver dissection was 64.5 years (range 32–89 years).
Oxaliplatin as first-line chemotherapy was administered
to 166 patients under the following regimes: FOLFOX
(92 patients), FOLFOX + Bevacizumab (52 patients),
XELOX+ Bevacizumab (5 patients), XELOX (3 patients),
and other regimens (14 patients).
Patients in the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
group (chemotherapy group) were generally younger (P
= 0.0014) and had more liver metastases (P = 0.0001)
than patients in the non-chemotherapy group (Table 1).
The mean number of liver metastases in the chemotherapy
group was 3.51 (range 1–19), versus 2.14 in the nonchemotherapy group (range 1–14) (P < 0.0001). There was
no significant difference in sex, tumor location, or tumor
differentiation between the two groups.

and without a prior oxaliplatin regimen

DPYD with both parameters. Age was not associated with
ERCC1 (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = -0.02; P
= 0.51) or DPYD mRNA level (Spearman’s correlation
coefficient = −0.04; P = 0.71). Similarly, no relationship
was found between number of liver metastasis and ERCC1
or DPYD mRNA levels (P = 0.69 and P = 0.76 for ERCC1
and DPYD, respectively).
We also examined whether a prior oxaliplatin
regimen altered the mRNA expression of DNA
topoisomerase I (TOP1), a recognized predictive
biomarker of irinotecan therapy. No significant difference
in TOP1 mRNA level was found between the groups
receiving and not receiving oxaliplatin (Figure 2).

As shown in Figure 2, ERCC1 mRNA expression
was significantly higher in the chemotherapy group
(mean 7.11; median 7.12) than in the non-chemotherapy
group (mean 6.94; median 6.88) (P = 0.033). DPYD
mRNA expression was similarly elevated in the
chemotherapy group (mean 5.32; median 5.17) relative
to the non-chemotherapy group (mean 5.04; median
5.17) (P = 0.023). In the chemotherapy group, ERCC1
or DPYD mRNA levels were unassociated with the
number of chemotherapeutic cycles and with type of
chemotherapeutic regimen (data not shown). However,
expression levels of ERCC1 and DPYD were significantly
correlated (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.42; P
< 0.0001) (Figure 3), consistent with the findings of our
previous single-center study.[11]
Given that chemotherapy history was significantly
related to patient age and number of liver metastasis
(Table 1), we correlated mRNA levels of ERCC1 and

Immunohistochemical results
The RT–PCR analysis revealed higher expression of
ERCC1 and DPYD mRNA in oxaliplatin-treated patients
than in non-treated patients. The protein expression levels
of these genes were determined by immunohistochemical
examination. Tumor cells contained appreciable quantities

of ERCC1 protein, especially in the nucleus, whereas
both tumor and stromal cells expressed DPD protein
(Supplemental figure 1). One of the investigators, blinded
to all other participant data, classified nuclear ERCC1 and
DPD expression as absent, weak, moderate, or strong.
Tumors with weak to strong expression were defined
as “positive,” and tumors not expressing these proteins
were defined as “negative.” Among 340 colorectal liver
metastases, 181 (55%) and 131 (39%) tumors tested
positive for ERCC1 and DPD, respectively. Importantly,
ERCC1 and DPD positivity was significantly associated
with mRNA expression levels for each gene (P=0.0042
for DPD, P<0.001 for ERCC1). Positive DPD was
significantly associated with prior oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy (p = 0.027; see Supplemental Table 2),
consistent with the RT–PCR results. Conversely, ERCC1
expression was unrelated to prior oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy (p = 0.44; Supplemental Table 2).

not received this therapy. Among the non-bevacizumab
group, 172 and 105 patients had received a prior
oxaliplatin-including regimen and no chemotherapy,
respectively. Results of tumoral VEGFA mRNA were
available in 301 patients. Importantly, VEGFA mRNA
expression level was higher in patients receiving
bevacizumab (n = 51; mean = 3.18, median = 3.12) than
in their non-bevacizumab counterparts (n = 251; mean =
2.81, median = 2.89) (p = 0.007) (Figure 4A). Additionally,
we found that whereas VEGFA mRNA expression levels
were unaffected by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, they
were significantly altered by bevacizumab (P = 0.014)
(Figure 4B). The bevacizumab-including regimen did
not influence the expression levels of ERCC1, DPYD, or
TOP1 (P > 0.10).

VEGFA expression level and bevacizumab

Our multicenter study of 346 CRC patients revealed
significantly higher ERCC1 and DPYD expression in
patients receiving oxaliplatin as a first-line chemotherapy
than in patients receiving no chemotherapy. Given that
IRIS (irinotecan/S-1) regimens based on the DPD inhibitor
fluoropyrimidine may be more effective against DPD-

DISCUSSION

To test the effect of bevacizumab on VEGFA mRNA
expression, we evaluated the mRNA expression level
of VEGFA in the presence and absence of bevacizumab
therapy. In this study, 63 patients had received a prior

high tumors than FOLFIRI, this finding is consistent
with a recent clinical study, which suggested that patients
previously treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
better responded to IRIS than to FOLFIRI.[9, 10] Second,
we found that administering bevacizumab to patients
raised their VEGFA expression levels, supporting that
bevacizumab encourages VEGFA mRNA expression
from tumor cells via feedback or alternative unknown
mechanisms. This phenomenon provides a possible
biologic rationale for continuing bevacizumab after first
progression.
Molecular responses to chemotherapy and
molecular-targeted therapy have been implicated in
acquired resistance to these therapies. Thus, by better
understanding these molecular alterations, we may select
a more effectual second-line regimen. To our knowledge,
we present the first demonstration of a basic rationale
for second-line therapy following failure of oxaliplatinbased first-line therapy in CRC patients. Additionally,
we hypothesized the biologic rationale for continuing
bevacizumab treatment after first progression. In this
context, the clinical implications of our study could be
considerable.
Although a previous analysis found that IRIS
was superior to FOLFIRI in patients previously treated
with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy,[9] the molecular
mechanisms underlying this finding were not clarified. In
our previous in-silico study of cell-line panel data retrieved
from the National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI60), oxaliplatin
and 5-FU sensitivities were significantly correlated, and

cells resistant to oxaliplatin showed significantly higher
ERCC1 and DPD expression than sensitive cells.[11]
Clinical samples also confirmed that the cancer cells of
FOLFOX-treated patients expressed significantly more
ERCC1 and DPD than cells of non-treated patients.
Based on these findings, we propose the following
hypothesis (Figure 5A). Following first-line oxaliplatinbased treatment, oxaliplatin-sensitive tumor cells (with
low ERCC1 levels; colored gray in Figure 5A) are killed,
whereas a small fraction of relatively oxaliplatin-resistant
cells (with high ERCC1 levels; colored red in Figure
5A) survive. The NCI60 cell-line data reveal ERCC1
and DPYD gene expressions as confounding factors;
therefore, surviving cells will express high levels of both
ERCC1 and DPYD. As the IRIS regimen contains the
DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine S-1,[20] it will more
effectively target DPD-high tumors than FOLFIRI (based
on fluoropyrimidine, which does not inhibit DPD). This
hypothesis was supported in the current study of more
than 300 CRC samples retrieved from multiple centers.
Of course, these findings must be consolidated by
further studies. We also need to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the confounding effects of ERCC1
and DPYD gene expression in cancer cells.
Continuing VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab
treatment beyond disease progression is widely accepted
as beneficial for patients with metastatic CRC. [1418] According to the “normalization” hypothesis,
bevacizumab instigates a redistribution of tumor blood
flow, increasing the delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor.

invasion, and metastatic potential in vivo.[25] Collectively,
our findings suggest that bevacizumab encourages VEGFA
mRNA expression in tumor cells via an unknown feedback
mechanism. Therefore, bevacizumab is a clinical necessity
even after first progression (Figure 5B).
There are advantages in accessing the databases of
multiple centers. The importance of large-scale studies
cannot be overemphasized, because small studies yielding
significant results are much more likely to be published
than those yielding null results, leading to publication

[21, 22] Another possible mechanism is treatment-related
changes in VEGFA, although attempts to predict the effect
of bevacizumab on tumor or plasma VEGFA levels have
been largely inconsistent. Several clinical studies have
demonstrated that bevacizumab delivery elevates levels
of circulating VEGFA.[19, 23, 24] Nonetheless, to our
knowledge, the effect of bevacizumab on tumoral VEGFA
levels has not been previously reported. CRC cells exposed
to bevacizumab increase their VEGFA gene expression,
with consequent increases in tumor cell migration and

bias. The 346 participants in the present study were
treated at 22 hospitals throughout Japan. Thus, this
sample better represents the Japanese CRC population
than samples collected from a few academic hospitals. The
limitations of a multiple database study are that resected
specimen-handling procedures (such as taking samples
and preparing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues)
subtly differ among medical centers. This may explain
our unexpected result that ERCC1 immunostaining is
independent of prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
Another limitation may be the lack of tumor specimens
which are obtained before chemotherapeutic treatment.
The current retrospective study could not examine the
relationship between pre-treatment status of ERCC1 and
DPYD expression and therapeutic response. In addition,
we could not set the cut-offs for these molecular markers
toward the future practical application in the clinical
setting. We acknowledge that a well-planned prospective
study is necessary to overcome these limitations.	
In summary, this multicenter study revealed that
ERCC1 and DPYD expression levels are increased by
first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, with possible
impacts on chemosensitivity to subsequent therapy.
Second, we found that bevacizumab administration
boosts VEGFA expression levels in the tumors of receiving
patients, providing a possible biologic rationale for
continuing bevacizumab treatment after first progression.

(97%) of the specimens. Thus, 336 colorectal tumors (166
from the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy group and 170
from the no-chemotherapy group) were finally included
in this study (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved
by the independent ethics committee of each participating
institution.

Quantitative RT-PCR
The protocols of RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
are shown in Supplemental data 1. Gene expression
levels of ERCC1, DPYD, topoisomerase-1 (TOP1) and
VEGFA were determined by TaqMan real-time PCR (Life
Technologies, Foster City, CA) as previously described.
[26, 27] The endogenous reference gene was β-Actin
(ACTB). All genes from all samples were run in triplicate.
The smallest detectable quantity of amplified cDNA
defines the cycle threshold (Ct) value, which is inversely
proportional to the cDNA content. Universal Mix RNAs
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as control calibrators
on each plate. The primer sequences for ERCC1, DPYD,
TOP1, VEGFA and ACTB were as previously described.
[27, 28] The adopted primers and probes are listed in
Supplemental Table 1.
The PCR reaction mixture comprised 1,200 nmol/L
of each primer, 200 nmol/L probe, 0.4 units of AmpliTaq
Gold Polymerase, 200 nmol/L each of dATP, dCTP,
dGTP, dTTP, 3.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1× Taqman buffer
A containing a reference dye. Reagents (all purchased
from Life technologies, Foster City, CA) were combined
in a final volume of 20 μL. Cycling conditions were 50°C
for 2 minutes and 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 46
15-second cycles at 95°C and 60°C for 1 minute. The
threshold cycle (Ct) was the fractional cycle number at
which the fluorescence generated by the probe cleavage
exceeded a fixed level above baseline. The relative amount
of tissue target mRNA, standardized against the amount
of ACTB mRNA, was expressed as −ΔCt = − (Ct(target
gene-1) − Ct(β-actin)). The number ratio of target mRNA
copies to ACTB mRNA copies was then calculated as 2−
ΔCt × K, where K is a constant.[29] To prevent significant
contamination by genomic DNA, we amplified nonreverse-transcribed RNA only.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
This retrospective study included 346 CRC
patients who underwent hepatectomy for liver metastasis
between April 2005 and October 2013 at 22 institutions
in Japan. All tumors were histologically diagnosed as
adenocarcinomas of the colon or rectum. As the aim
of this study was to compare the expression levels of
ERCC1, DPYD and VEGFA between patients receiving
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and patients receiving
no chemotherapy, we enrolled both types of patients
equally. As a result, 171 patients had undergone no
chemotherapy prior to hepatectomy, and 175 patients had
received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy [5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (92 cases),
FOLFOX + Bevacizumab (58 cases), capecitabine and
oxaliplatin (XELOX) (5 cases), XELOX + Bevacizumab
(5 cases), other treatments (15 cases)] prior to
hepatectomy. On average, the chemotherapy group had
received 8 courses (cycles) of treatment (range 2–34
courses). We initially subjected 346 cancer specimens to
molecular analyses (i.e., immunohistochemical staining
and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), and retrieved valid results from 336

Immunohistochemical staining
In preparation for ERCC1 and DPD analyses, the
slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
anti-ERCC1 monoclonal antibody (Clone D-10; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and primary
anti-DPD monoclonal antibody (Clone OF-303, Taiho
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Both
antibodies were diluted by a factor of 100. The secondary
antibody was a ready-to-use anti-mouse EnVisionPeroxidase system (Dako Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
