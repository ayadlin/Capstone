ABSTRACT:
Neuroblastomas express increased levels of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor
(GRP-R). However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in GRP-R-mediated cell
signaling in neuroblastoma growth and metastasis are unknown. Here, we report
that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as a critical downstream target of GRP-R, is an
important regulator of neuroblastoma tumorigenicity. We found that FAK expression
correlates with GRP-R expression in human neuroblastoma sections and cell lines.
GRP-R overexpression in SK-N-SH cells increased FAK, integrin α3 and β1 expressions
and cell migration. These cells demonstrated flatter cell morphology with broad
lamellae, in which intense FAK expression was localized to the leading edges of
lamellipodia. Interestingly, FAK activation was, in part, dependent on integrin α3 and
β1 expression. Conversely, GRP-R silencing decreased FAK as well as Mycn levels in
BE(2)-C cells, which displayed a denser cellular morphology. Importantly, rescue
experiments in GRP-R silenced BE(2)-C cells showed FAK overexpression significantly
enhanced cell viability and soft agar colony formation; similarly, FAK overexpression
in SK-N-SH cells also resulted in increased cell growth. These effects were reversed
in FAK silenced BE(2)-C cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Moreover, we evaluated
the effect of FAK inhibition in vivo. FAK inhibitor (Y15) suppressed GRP-induced
neuroblastoma growth and metastasis. Our results indicate that FAK is a critical
downstream regulator of GRP-R, which mediates tumorigenesis and metastasis in
neuroblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

plays critical roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis in
neuroblastoma. However, we have yet to clearly define the
molecular mechanisms responsible for GRP-R-mediated
tumorigenicity.
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a 125-kDa
cytoplasmic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, plays
an essential role in cell adhesion and migration [4]. FAK
is comprised of a central catalytic domain flanked by large
N- and C-terminal non-catalytic domains. The N-terminal
domain of FAK binds to sequences in the cytoplasmic
domain of β-integrin subunits, thereby functioning as
an important member of the integrin signaling pathway.
The C-terminal region of FAK is rich in protein-protein
interaction sites, directing FAK to newly-formed and

Neuroblastoma is highly aggressive with frequent
metastases, which contributes to overall significant
morbidity and mortality [1]. We have shown that
gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), a G-protein
coupled receptor, is involved in neuroblastoma cell
survival, invasive potential and metastasis [2, 3]. We
reported that the upregulation of GRP-R increases the
binding capacity for its ligand GRP, resulting in a faster
constitutive neuroblastoma cellular growth rate [2].
Conversely, downregulation of GRP-R reversed the
aggressive cell phenotype and inhibited liver metastases
in vivo [3]. Therefore, GRP-R-mediated signaling

existing adhesion complexes [4]. Cancers are known
to express FAK, which is responsible for stimulated
cell motility, invasiveness and proliferation [5-7]. FAK
activation is involved in various intracellular pathways,
including GRP-mediated cell signaling [8, 9].
High levels of GRP-R and FAK have been reported
in prostatic tissues from patients with advanced cancer
and in tumorigenic cell lines [5]. One report showed
that expression of FAK and phosphorylated (p)-FAK
(Y397) correlates with the degree of colon cancer cell
differentiation as well as to GRP/GRP-R co-expression
[10]. Bombesin (BBS), an amphibian equivalent of GRP,
induces PC-3 cell motility through FAK activation [11].
We and others have shown that GRP and BBS bind to
GRP-R with high affinity to stimulate neuroblastoma cell
growth in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion [11, 12].
However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved
in GRP/GRP-R-mediated FAK activation and subsequent
neuroblastoma cell growth, motility and metastasis remain
unclear.
In this study, we show that GRP-R and FAK
expressions in human neuroblastoma tissues and cell
lines correlate with tumor malignancy. Exogenous GRP
induced FAK activation at Y397 and enhanced cell
migration. Interestingly, GRP-R overexpression increased
FAK, integrin expressions as well as cell migration in
SK-N-SH cells. Conversely, GRP-R silencing resulted in
decreased FAK and Mycn proteins in BE(2)-C cells while
FAK overexpression in GRP-R silenced BE(2)-C cells
rescued cell growth. Moreover, FAK overexpression alone
led to an increase in soft agar colony formation in SKN-SH cells, whereas FAK silencing resulted in decreased
colony formation in BE(2)-C cells. We also found that
FAK silencing in BE(2)-C cells suppressed tumorigenesis
and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, using an intrasplenic
murine model and bioluminescence imaging system,
we confirmed that treatment with Y15, a FAK inhibitor,
blocks BBS-induced neuroblastoma growth and liver
metastases in vivo. Our results demonstrated that FAK
correlates with GRP-R, and that it exerts oncogenic
effects in neuroblastoma as a mediator of GRP-R signaling
pathway. Hence, FAK may be a clinically important
therapeutic target in the treatment of neuroblastomas.

we wanted to determine whether GRP-R expression
is associated with FAK in neuroblastoma. First, we
performed immunohistochemistry to assess GRP-R
and FAK expression in seven paraffin-embedded
tumor sections consisting of five undifferentiated
neuroblastomas and two ganglioneuromas. As expected,
increased FAK expression was noted in undifferentiated
neuroblastomas when compared to more benign phenotype
of ganglioneuromas; its expression also correlated with
GRP-R (Fig. 1A). But due to the limited sample size, we
could not determine a correlation of these two protein
markers with clinical disease staging. Next, when grown
on soft agar, BE(2)-C cells exhibited significantly more
colony formation (Fig. 1B), which indicates malignant
potential. Consistent with GRP-R protein levels, we found
higher levels of FAK protein (Fig. 1B) as well as mRNA
(Fig. 1C) in BE(2)-C when compared to SK-N-SH cells.
Immunofluorescence also demonstrated that BE(2)-C cells
show more intense GRP-R and FAK expression when
compared to SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1D). FAK activation at
Y397 site by GRP is well established in 293 HEK cells
and various other cancer types [8, 11, 14]. When GRP was
exogenously administered for 5 min, we noted a dosedependent increase in p-FAK levels in BE(2)-C but not
SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 1E). Moreover, we also found that
GRP treatment induces significant BE(2)-C cell migration
in both transwell migration (Supplemental data; Fig.
S1B). These results show that FAK expression correlates
with malignant potential induced by increased GRP-R
expression in neuroblastoma. Our results also support for
the important role of FAK as a mediator of GRP/GRP-R
signaling, and further validate GRP as an inducer of cell
migration in neuroblastoma.

GRP-R overexpression increased FAK and cell
migration in SK-N-SH.
To determine the positive relationship between FAK
and GRP-R in neuroblastoma cells, we next performed
studies using a GRP-R overexpressing SK-N-SH cell
line established in our laboratory [2]. In figure 2A,
GRP-R overexpressing SK-N-SH cells showed increased
GRP-R mRNA expression but no significant increase
of FAK mRNA (*= p <0.05 vs. SK/CON). However,
immunoblotting showed that FAK protein is upregulated
in GRP-R overexpressing SK-N-SH cells when compared
to controls (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, integrin α3 and β1
expressions were also significantly upregulated in GRP-R
overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm whether
increased FAK activation in GRP-R overexpressing cells
is dependent on these upregualted integrin expressions,
we next performed dual silencing of integrin α3 and
β1 (siIntegrin α3β1) in GRP-R overexpressing SK-NSH cells and found that siIntegrin α3β1 significantly
decreased p-FAK expression (Fig. 2C). Additionally, to

RESULTS
GRP-R and FAK correlated with malignant
potential of neuroblastoma, and GRP induced FAK
activation (Y397) and cell migration.
We reported that an increased GRP and
GRP-R expression is found in more undifferentiated
neuroblastoma [12]. FAK expression has been correlated
with advanced-stage neuroblastoma [13]. In this study,

validate these findings and to localize FAK expression,
we next performed immunofluorescence study. GRP-R
overexpressing SK-N-SH cells, which have an altered
cell morphology exhibiting a flatter shape with broad
lamellipodial projections, showed significantly enhanced
FAK expression at the leading edges of cells (Fig. 2D).
Furthermore, GRP-R overexpressing SK-N-SH cells
exhibited increased cell migration in the transwell
plates coated with collagen type I (Fig. 2E). These
results indicate that GRP-R regulates FAK levels posttranscriptionally and FAK activation is regulated in part
by integrin expressions in GRP-R overexpressing SK-NSH cells.

GRP-R silencing decreased FAK and cell migration
in BE(2)-C cells.
Next, to further validate the correlation between
GRP-R and FAK, we used stably-transfected GRP-R
silenced BE(2)-C cells (shGRP-R) established in our
laboratory [3]. In figure 3A, GRP-R silenced BE(2)-C cells
showed decreases in both GRP-R as well as FAK mRNA
levels (*= p <0.05 vs. BE/shCON). Furthermore, we found
that both phosphorylated and total FAK protein levels
were decreased in shGRP-R (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we
also found that shGRP-R cells downregulated Mycn (Fig.
3B), which is a well known transcription factor of FAK
in neuroblastoma [15, 16]. Consistent with these findings,
immunofluorescence showed significantly weaker FAK
expression in shGRP-R when compared to control cells
(shCON) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the appearance of BE(2)-C
cells changed from their typical flat and aggregated
morphology to a small and rounder shape after transfection
with silencing of GRP-R. Furthermore, shGRP-R cells
exhibited decreased cell migration in the transwell plates
coated with collagen type I (Fig. 3D). Hence, our results
support a positive correlation between GRP-R and FAK,
indicating that GRP-R is important in the regulation of
FAK-induced changes in cell morphology and increased
migration in neuroblastoma cells.

formation was observed in BE(2)-C cells. BE(2)-C cells

mRNA was also observed in BE(2)-C cells. FAK mRNA level

SK-N-SH cells (*= p <0.05 vs. no treated control).

FAK regulated neuroblastoma cell growth in vitro
and in vivo.
In order to examine the critical role of FAK on
neuroblastoma malignant potential, we transiently
transfected SK-N-SH and BE(2)-C cells with FAK
plasmid (Fig. 4A) and siRNA against FAK (siFAK) (Fig.
4D), respectively. To validate the effects of downstream
signaling pathways on modulating FAK expression in each
cell line, phosphorylated and total expressions of AKT
and ERK1/2 were examined. Interestingly, modulation of
FAK expression led to differential expression of p-AKT
and p-ERK (Figs. 4A, D). FAK overexpression stimulated
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK. Conversely, FAK

silencing decreased p-AKT and p-ERK levels, hence
suggesting a mechanism of FAK activation of PI3K and
MEK pathways in neuroblastoma cells. We used soft
agar colony assay to assess for anchorage-independent
cell growth, which is a well-established indicator
of tumorigenicity of cancer cells in vitro [17]. FAK
overexpression showed an increased number of colonies
by > 2.5-fold, and quite interestingly, it also resulted in
formation of larger colonies (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, cell
viability also increased over a time course with most
significant increase at 96 h (Fig. 4C). In contrast, siFAK
showed decreased number of colonies by 35%; siFAK
resulted in fewer and smaller colonies when compared
to siNTC (Fig. 4E). siFAK also significantly decreased
BE(2)-C cell viability (Fig. 4F). To validate these findings
in vivo and to further examine the metastatic potential
of BE(2)-C cells stably-transfected with shRNA against
either control (shCON) or FAK (shFAK), we performed
intrasplenic injections of neuroblastoma cells in nude
mice. Our laboratory established a murine model to
investigate neuroblastoma metastasis, and reported

that GRP-R silencing inhibited tumor growth and liver
metastases in vivo [3]. The specificity of FAK silencing
was demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 4G). Six
weeks after injections, tumor volumes of spleen and
liver were examined. While shCON formed numerous
large liver metastases, shFAK developed very few liver
lesions (Fig. 4H). The average spleen and liver weight in
the shFAK group was approximately 62% of the shCON
group (mean value 0.08 for shCON vs. 0.05 for shFAK)
(Fig. 4I). These results indicate that FAK silencing
decreases malignant potential of neuroblastoma cells, thus
providing further support for the importance of FAK as a
regulator of neuroblastoma malignancy.

FAK overexpression rescued GRP-R silencingmediated inhibition of cell growth in vitro and in
vivo.
To assess whether FAK is a downstream target of
GRP-R-mediated cell signaling, we next performed rescue

experiments using a FAK plasmid in shGRP-R cells in
order to test whether FAK overexpression recovers the
inhibitory effect of shGRP-R. Immunoblotting showed
knockdown of GRP-R and overexpression of FAK after
transfections (Fig. 5A). As previously reported [3],
shGRP-R exhibited significantly reduced number of soft
agar colony formation. FAK overexpression resulted in
increased colony formation in both shCON and shGRP-R
cells (Fig. 5B). FAK overexpression in shGRP-R cells
rescued their ability to form colonies similar in value to
that of shCON. Correlative to soft agar colony formation,
cell viability assays demonstrated restored cell growth
after FAK overexpression in shGRP-R cells (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, to demonstrate these observations in
vivo, we used a murine model after stably-transfecting
BE(2)-C cells with a lentiviral system of FAK plasmid.
Specificity of each protein expression was demonstrated
by immunoblotting (Fig. 5D). BE(2)-C cells with GRP-R
knockdown (GC) induced fewer metastatic lesions in the
liver when compared to control (CC), and reintroducing
GRP-R (GG) into cells rescued the inhibitory effect
of GC (Fig. 5E). Although FAK overexpression in GC
(GF) did not show statistically significant effects on liver
metastasis, the mean weight of spleen and liver in these
mice increased by ~1.5-fold of GC (mean value 0.06 for
GC vs. 0.09 for GF) (Fig. 5F). These findings suggest that
FAK plays a critical role in GRP-R-induced anchorage-

independent growth. Also, as a downstream target of
GRP-R, FAK expression, compensates, in part, for the
inhibitory effect of GRP-R silencing in neuroblastoma.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that FAK is an
important mediator in the GRP/GRP-R signaling pathway.

FAK inhibitor reduced BBS induced-tumor growth
and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.
Previously, we have reported that BBS, an
amphibian equivalent of GRP, promotes neuroblastoma
tumor growth in vivo, and is an important stimulator
of angiogenic pathway [18, 19]. Additionally, Y15
compound, a FAK-specific inhibitor, has shown to
decrease neuroblastoma growth in vivo [20, 21]. In this
study, we wanted to determine whether FAK inhibition
could block BBS-induced tumor growth and metastases
in vivo. First of all, we found that pre-treatment with
Y15 compound (10 μM) for 30 min failed to induce
FAK activation at Y397 followed by GRP for 5 min after
overnight serum starvation in BE(2)-C cells in vitro (Fig.
6A). GRP alone induced activation of AKT and ERK1/2,
whereas Y15 treatment attenuated GRP-induced increases
in p-AKT and p-ERK (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the Y15
treatment also significantly inhibited GRP-induced colony
formation in soft agar by > 2-fold (Fig. 6B). Based on

these findings, 1 × 106 of luciferase-expressing BE(2)-C
cells were injected into spleen in athymic nude mice. After
three days, they were randomized into four groups: control
(PBS vehicle), BBS (20 μg/kg/i.p./t.i.d.), Y15 (30 mg/kg/
i.p./day), and BBS plus Y15. Bioluminescence imaging
system was used to monitor for primary tumor growth
in spleen as well as liver metastasis. As shown in Figure
6C, signals exhibited relatively equal intensities on day 1;
however, by day 20, BBS significantly increased primary

splenic tumor growth as well as liver metastases while
a combination treatment with Y15 showed remarkable
reduction in tumor growth and metastases. The inhibitory
effects of Y15 in BBS-induced tumor growth were
confirmed by luciferase activity of luciferase-expressing
BE(2)-C cells (Fig. 6C-E) as well as by spleen and liver
weight (Fig. 6F). Differences in luciferase activity at
day 20 correlated with tumor weights in the liver and
spleen. BBS increased luciferase activity by > 80-fold as

compared to controls (mean activity 5.30 × 107 photons/s
for controls vs. 4.27 × 109 photons/s for BBS) whereas
Y15 decreased the activity by < 110-fold as compared to
controls (mean activity 5.30 × 107 photons/s for controls
vs. 4.78 × 105 photons/s for Y15). More importantly, BBS
plus Y15 combination significantly reduced luciferase
activity when compared to BBS alone (mean activity
4.27 × 109 photons/s for BBS vs. 2.65 × 105 photons/s for
BBS plus Y15). Thus, our in vivo data corroborate in vitro
findings, and further suggest that FAK is an important
regulator in GRP/GRP-R signaling pathway and tumor
metastasis in neuroblastoma.

of FAK repressed GRP/GRP-R signaling involved in
neuroblastoma progression. These results suggested that
FAK is a critical downstream target of GRP/GRP-R,
and therefore may be a promising therapeutic target for
malignant neuroblastomas.
GRP, the mammalian analogue of BBS, is a growth
factor that promotes cell proliferation in cancer cells [22,
23]. Specifically, GRP induces activation of FAK at Y397
site, which is known to be critical for promoting both
integrin- and/or growth-factor-stimulated cell migration,
and is also a high-affinity binding site for Src homology
2 (SH2) of the Src family kinases [24]. These known
associations create the possibility for interaction with a
number of different signaling and adaptor proteins. In
the present study, we found that GRP/GRP-R signaling
regulates FAK activation and expression. We also
found that GRP-R expression correlates with integrin
expressions. Thus, our findings further support published
results that integrin and growth-factor receptor signaling
can interact through either membrane-proximal clustering
of the two receptor types or the activation of common
downstream signaling pathways [25, 26].
Our findings corroborate the multiple tumorigenic
functions of FAK, which are associated with various
malignant and aggressive tumors, including ductal
carcinomas of the breast [27], primary colorectal tumors
and metastases [28], and endometrial carcinomas [29].
FAK has been used as a prognostic indicator as well as a
marker for malignant transformation in breast carcinoma

DISCUSSION
We previously demonstrated that GRP-R
is overexpressed in malignant, advanced-stage
neuroblastomas, and that GRP-R silencing suppresses
tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo [3, 12]. However, the
exact molecular mechanisms of GPR/GRP-R regulation
of tumor progression are yet to be delineated. In this
study, we provide compelling evidence from cell and
animal studies that FAK is an important mediator of
GRP/GRP-R signaling-induced neuroblastoma growth
and metastasis. We investigated the relationship between
GRP-R and FAK, as well as the effect of FAK silencing
using transfected cells and/or a pharmacologic agent on
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. GRP/GRP-R regulated
FAK activation and expression, and further inhibition

[30]. Additionally, FAK has also been established as a
significant component in the BBS signaling pathways in
prostate cancer [8, 9, 11] and described to play a critical
role in GRP-mediated morphogenesis of colon cancer
[14]. Glover et al. [8] showed that the FAK Y397 site is
critical for GRP-induced morphogenesis in 293 HEK cells,
and we have shown that BBS promotes tumor growth and
angiogenesis in neuroblastoma in vivo [18, 19]. Here, we
show that GRP or BBS stimulates neuroblastoma cell
migration as well as liver metastases, further supporting a
critical tumorigenic role of GRP or BBS in neuroblastoma.
More importantly, our results, for the first time, show
that FAK inhibition is critical to block the BBS-induced
tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo, and thus, further
indicating FAK as an important therapeutic target in the
treatment of neuroblastomas.
Y15
compound,
1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine
tetrahydrochloride, has been shown to block
phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 in neuroblastoma
cell lines as well as inhibit growth of Mycn-amplified
neuroblastoma tumors in vivo [20]. In our study, we
used Mycn-amplified I-type BE(2)-C and Mycn single
copy N-type SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell lines. Since,
Mycn regulates FAK expression at the promoter level
in neuroblastoma cells [31], we speculated that GRP-R
signaling would affect FAK by regulating Mycn. This is
supported by the results that showed reduced level of FAK
mRNA in GRP-R silenced BE(2)-C cells. However, the
molecular mechanism of GRP/GRP-R signaling regulation
of Mycn and subsequently FAK in Mycn-amplified
neuroblastoma cells or Mycn single copy neuroblastoma
cells remain to be defined.
Tilghman et al. [32] noted that the loss of FAK
resulted in marked changes in cell morphology and defects
in leading edge formation. Similar to their findings, we
also found that silencing of FAK by either cell transfection
or chemical compound induced morphological changes
analogous to the effects of silencing of GRP-R, and further
inhibited colony formation. Hence, we infer that GRP-R
and FAK are essential for regulating cell morphology,
which can associate with the oncogenic properties such
as highly migratory, anchorage-independent phenotype
in neuroblastoma. Therefore, a better understanding of
GRP-R and FAK regulation may not only be of biological
significance, but it may also provide a molecular basis for
potential clinical applications.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that FAK
is a crucial regulator of GRP/GRP-R signaling in
neuroblastoma. GRP/GRP-R regulates neuroblastoma
cell growth, transformation and migration by correlative
regulation of FAK. Furthermore, our results suggest
that targeting FAK can inhibit GRP/GRP-R-mediated
oncogenic properties. Moreover, our study demonstrates
the roles of FAK in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and
metastasis in vitro and in vivo. These findings are clinically
relevant because advanced-stage neuroblastoma is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

oftentimes refractory to current multi-modality treatment
protocols, and effective novel therapeutic target(s) are
highly desirable. Hence, a better understanding of the
mechanisms involved in GRP-R/FAK-induced metastatic
potential could provide insights into development of novel
strategies in the treatment of aggressive, undifferentiated
neuroblastoma.

shFAK and pCDH-FAK plasmids for in vivo study were
kindly provided by Dr. S.T. Lim (University of South
Alabama). pMSCV-LucSh, which contains a luciferase
and zeocin-resistance fusion gene was also kindly
provided by Dr. Andrew M. Davidoff (St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital). Stably-transfected cells for GRP-R
were established by selection with G418 at 300 μg/
ml and/or zeocin at 50 μg/ml for 2 weeks as described
[3]. Stable populations of shFAK cells were obtained by
lentiviral infection and puromycin selection at 2.5 μg/ml.
Luciferase-expressing cells were established by selection
with zeocin at 50 μg/ml.	

Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueousTM
(Ambion). Isolated RNA (1 μg) was used to
synthesize cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Primers were designed to amplify a 158-bp

primers were the same as published [33]. QRT-PCR was
performed in the CFX96™ Real-Time PCR Detection
Systems using SsoFast™ EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad).

was performed in triplicates and the values, corresponding
to the number of viable cells, were read at OD450 with
the EL808 Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio Tek Instrument).

Immunofluorescence

Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in media
containing 0.4% agarose and 7.5% FBS and then
overlaid onto a bottom layer of solidified 0.8% agarose
in 5% serum media. SK-N-SH and BE(2)-C were plated
at concentrations of 5x103 cells/well and 3x103 cells/
well of a 12-well plate and incubated for 5 and 3 weeks,
respectively. Colonies were stained with 0.05% Crystal
Violet, photographed and quantified.

Colony formation

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS
for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies
(1:100) for 1 h at RT, washed five times with PBS and then
incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200) for 30 min
at RT. The nuclei were counterstained with Vectashield
mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
The immunofluorescence of FAK was observed under a
fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600).

Migration assay
Transwell filters (8  μm; Corning) were coated
on the lower side with 5 μg/ml collagen type I (BD
Biosciences) overnight and then blocked with 2.5% BSA/
PBS for 1 h. 1 × 105 cells in serum-free media added to
the upper and incubated for 4  h. Cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI and counted.
Assay was performed in duplicates, and counting was
from five randomly selected microscopic fields (200×
magnification).

Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in formalin for 3 days and
embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin-embedded sections (5
μm) were deparaffinized in three xylene washes followed
by a graded alcohol series, antigen retrieval performed
with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, and then blocked with
blocking solution for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, washed with
PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at
RT, and developed with DAB reagent. All sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin, and then dehydrated
with ethanol and xylene. Coverslips were mounted and
slides observed by light microscopy.

In vivo assay
Male athymic nude mice (4–6 weeks old) were
maintained as described [18]. All studies were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
were conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by
the NIH. BE(2)-C cells were transfected with luciferase
alone or stably-transfected with plasmids (shCON,
shGRP-R, shFAK and/or pCDH, pCDH-FAK). 1 × 106
cells of 50 μl of HBSS were intrasplenically injected
as described [3]. Mice were treated daily with 50 μl of
control vehicle (PBS) or Y15 (30 mg/kg/day) and/or BBS
(20 μg/kg/t.i.d.). Dosages were chosen based on previous
results [18, 21]. Tumor growth was observed by measuring
luciferase signal with bioluminescence imaging system
(IVIS Lumina II, Xenogen, Caliper Life Sciences) and
body weight was measured weekly. Mice were injected
with D-luciferin (OZ Biosciences) subcutaneously (1 mg/
mouse in 100 μl of HBSS) before being anesthetized with
isofluorane. Measurement of total flux (photons/sec) of the
emitted light reflects the relative number of viable cells
in the tumor. Data were analyzed using Xenogen Living
Image software (version 4.1). At sacrifice, spleens and
livers were excised, weighed and fixed in formalin for
further analyses.

Immunoblotting
Whole cell lysates were collected using cell lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1%
Triton X-100, aprotinin, leupeptin, and 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors
(Roche). PMSF (1 mM) was added immediately prior
to use. Protein (30 μg) was run on a SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and probed with
antibodies. Blots were developed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).
ImageJ (NIH) was used for densitometry.

Cell viability
Cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 103 cells in a
96-well plate and grown for up to 4 days after transfection.
Cell numbers were assessed using CCK-8 daily. Assay
