ABSTRACT
Background: Polo-like kinase 4 PLK4 plays a key role in centriole replication.
Hence PLK4 inhibition disrupts mitosis, and offers a novel approach to treating
chromosomally unstable cancers, including pancreatic cancer. CFI-400945 is a first
in class small molecule PLK4 inhibitor, currently undergoing early phase clinical trials.
Results: Treatment with CFI-400945 significantly reduced tumor growth and
increased survival in four out of the six models tested. Consistent with PLK4 inhibition,
we observed reduced expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 associated with
an increase in nuclear diameter during treatment with CFI-400945. Additionally,
treatment with CFI-400945 resulted in a significant reduction of tumor-initiating cells.
Discussion: These results support the further investigation of PLK4 as a drug
target in pancreatic cancer.
Methods: Sensitivity to CFI-400945 was tested in a series of six patientderived pancreatic cancer xenografts, selected to represent the range of growth
characteristics, genetic features, and hypoxia found in pancreatic cancer patients.

kinase 4 (PLK4) plays a unique role in centriole regulation
[8]. Genetic manipulations that deplete PLK4 disrupt
centriole duplication, whereas overexpression causes
centrosome amplification. Although PLK4 inhibition
would be expected to disturb mitosis in normal cells,
potentially this would be more severe in chromosomallyunstable cancers, providing a clinically-useful therapeutic
window. CFI-400945 is a potent PLK4 inhibitor that is
currently undergoing a phase I clinical trial [9, 10, 11].
Treatment with CFI-400945 in vitro led to aberrant
centriole duplication and abnormal mitoses resulting
in cell death or cell-cycle arrest [9]. Preclinical testing
showed single agent activity against patient-derived breast
cancer xenografts [9]. This study showed an increased
sensitivity of PTEN-null tumors to PLK4 inhibition using
CFI-400945, suggesting that PTEN deficiency may be a
predictive biomarker of CFI-400945 response [9]. In the
present study we therefore tested CFI-400945 for activity
in a series of orthotopically-grown, patient-derived
pancreatic cancer xenografts, selected to represent the
range of genetic and growth characteristics seen in the
clinic.

INTRODUCTION
The genomic landscape of pancreatic cancer is
dominated by a high prevalence of mutations involving
K-Ras, p53, SMAD4, and p16 [1, 2], none of which is
readily targetable using currently available agents. An
emerging picture from ongoing sequencing studies
indicates that these cancers are characterized by an
unusually high level of chromosomal instability [1,
2]. It is likely that this accounts, at least in part, for
their rapid progression towards the aggressive, drugresistant phenotype observed in the clinic. Recently it
has been suggested that chromosomal instability causes
vulnerability to agents that disrupt orderly movement
through the late cell cycle, suggesting a novel approach to
the treatment of these highly lethal cancers.
Polo-like kinases (PLKs) form a family of
structurally related mitotic kinases with diverse functions
in the normal regulation of the late cell cycle [3, 4]. All
members of the PLK family have been shown to be
dysregulated in several types of cancer [5, 6, 7], and they
are considered to be candidate drug targets. Polo-like

Effects of CFI-400945 on tissue markers of cell
growth

positive control, although in OCIP110 PTEN staining
was appreciably less when compared to the stroma
(Figure 1C, Table 1). Mutations in p53 were found in
OCIP23 and OCIP110, resulting in widespread detection
of p53 by IHC (Figure 1D; Table 1). As we reported
previously, one of these models, OCIP28, is derived
from a patient with a germline BRCA2 mutation [12].
All models show mutation in Kras codon 12.

The effects on Ki-67 and pH3 labeling, and
nuclear size are summarized in Figure 3. As expected,
the baseline levels of the two proliferation markers
were roughly concordant with each other, and with the
tumor growth rates (Figure 3A and 3B). The effects
of treatment with CFI-400945 were variable between
the different models. Although broadly consistent with
inhibition of proliferation, with the most sensitive model
OCIP51 showing the largest decreases in Ki-67 and pH3,
significant effects on these markers were also seen in two
non-responsive models, OCIP19 and 23.
To investigate whether, in addition to reducing entry
into mitosis, treatment with CFI-400945 also influenced
progression through mitosis, nuclei positive for pH3 were
evaluated for mitotic phases (Supplementary Table S1).
Although some tumor showed significant differences in
prophase, these changes were model specific and showed
no correlation with the response groups established based
on tumor growth and survival (Supplementary Table S1,
Supplementary Table S2).
While assessing these nuclear markers we noted
increases in nuclear size of the treatment groups (Figure
3C). As shown in Figure 3D, the increases in mean nuclear
diameter following treatment with the PLK4 inhibitor were
statistically significant in all models, with the exception
of the least responsive to growth inhibition, OCIP19,
and most evident in the highly responsive OCIP51 PDX.
In contrast, the levels of cleaved caspase 3, a marker of
apoptosis, were unchanged by treatment in all six models
(Supplementary Figure S2).

Effects of PLK4 inhibitor CFI-400945 on tumor
growth
The six models tested showed a wide range in
sensitivity to CFI-400945, as summarized in Figure
2. Tumor weights following three weeks of treatment
were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in OCIP28, 51 and
110 compared to vehicle control (Figure 2A). All three
of these tumors also showed significant prolongation of
survival following treatment with CFI-400945 compared
to control, as did a fourth model, OCIP167 that showed
borderline significant reduction in tumor weight at three
weeks (Figure 2B). Treatment response was not correlated
with the expression levels of the drug target PLK4 as
assessed by qRT-PCR.
One model, OCIP51, was highly sensitive to CFI400945, with sustained survival following the initial
three weeks of treatment. In order to evaluate whether
OCIP51 acquires resistance to CFI-400945, tumors
previously treated with one course of CFI-400945
were re-implanted orthotopically. When palpable,
animals were treated for a further 21 days with either
CFI-400945 or vehicle. Re-treatment with CFI-400945
significantly reduced tumor growth and increased
survival when compared to the untreated control
(p=0.0004), indicating that the initial exposure to drug
did not select for the emergence of drug resistance
(Figure 2C). As previously reported [9], treatment with
CFI-400945 was well tolerated, with no signs of distress
apart from weight loss (Supplementary Figure S1).

IHC stainings for A. pH3 and B. Ki67 (n=4-5). pH3 positive cells counted and the total number of pH3 positive nuclei was normalized to
the area of viable tumor tissue in order to account for differences in tumor size. Treatment with CFI-400945 reduced the fraction of Ki-67
positive cells in OCIP19 (p=0.029), OCIP28 (p=0.032), OCIP51 (p= 0.029) but not in OCIP23 (p=0.84), OCIP110 (p=0.063), OCIP167

xenograft models (OCIP19, 23, 51 and 167) were treated
with a single dose of 52mg/kg CFI-400945 and processed
for limiting dilution assays. Consistent with the growth
inhibition results, CFI-400945 treatment of OCIP19
tumors had little effect on the number of TIC. In OCIP23,
51 and 167, on the other hand, TIC frequency was reduced
by an order of magnitude in response to treatment with
CFI-400945 (Table 2).

In an earlier publication, Mason et al. [9] suggested
that reduced expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN
predicted the sensitivity of breast cancers to CFI-400945.
However, this appears not to be the case with pancreatic
cancers, since the sensitive models express the protein,
whereas the only PTEN deficient PDX, OCIP23, was
resistant.
Drug resistance, both intrinsic and acquired, appears
to be a major reason for treatment failure in pancreatic
cancer patients. There appears to be very little intrinsic
resistance to PLK4 inhibition based on the effects on
tumor cell proliferation and tumor weight observed in this
study. Re-challenge of tumors derived from a xenograft
tumor previously treated with a full course of CFI-400945
showed only minimal loss of CFI-400945 efficacy,
suggesting that treatment with CFI-400945 only leads to
minimal development of acquired drug resistance. CFI400945 is currently undergoing Phase 1 clinical testing
(NCT01954316). Based on the results presented here we
suggest that CFI-400945 presents a novel therapeutic
option for pancreatic cancer patients.

DISCUSSION
The present study evaluates the efficacy of CFI400945 in a panel of patient-derived pancreatic cancer
xenografts displaying a range of growth rates, magnitudes
of tumor hypoxia and PLK4 mRNA expression. Treatment
with CFI-400945 significantly reduced tumor growth and
increased survival in the majority of the tested xenograft
models. In addition to its effect on tumor growth, treatment
with CFI-400945 results in a significant reduction in
tumor-initiating potential. Taken together, this suggests
that CFI-400945 treatment targets both the proliferative
tumor cell and the TIC population through inhibition of
mitotic entry and failure of cytokinesis in response to
ablation of spindle formation.
Given the wide range in the response to CFI-400945
in these models, we were interested to identify candidate
biomarkers to predict sensitivity in pancreatic cancer
patients. The six models used were selected to represent
a range of the common mutations linked to pancreatic
cancer, and in their growth patterns and the extent of
tumor hypoxia, which we have previously shown to be
a major correlate of aggressive growth in these models.
Interestingly, the most sensitive PDX, OCIP51, also has
the most rapid growth, rapid metastasis and greatest level
of hypoxia, suggesting that PLK4 inhibition might be
particularly effective against clinically aggressive disease.
However, a genetic basis for such a link remains elusive,
and further research is ongoing [9].
In the present series, expression of the drug target
PLK4 did not correlate with sensitivity to CFI-400945.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Establishment and characterization of patientderived xenografts
Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established
from pancreatectomy samples superfluous to patient
diagnosis or ascites samples using a protocol approved
by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board.
Informed consent was obtained from all participating
patients. PDX models were maintained at the orthotopic
site in Severe Combined Immune Deficient (SCID) mice
according to institutional guidelines for human and animal
research, as previously described [13]. Because tumor size
is not readily measured at the orthotopic site, growth rates
were defined as the average time between two passages.
The levels of hypoxia were determined by administration
of the 2-nitroimidazole tracer EF5 4 hours prior to
3069

sacrifice, and immunohistochemistry using anti-EF5, as
previously described [13–17]. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) was used to determine PTEN and p53 status. Briefly,
tissue sections were stained for p53 (VP-P958 (clone DO7), Vector Labs, Burlington, ON, CA, 1:250) or PTEN
(#9559, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, 1:100) for 2h.
After incubation in biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (BA-1000,
Vector Labs, Burlington, ON, CA, 1:200) followed by HRP
labeling reagent (Signet Pathology System Inc, Dedham,
MA, USA) for 30min, immunoreactivities were revealed
by incubation in Nova Red substrate (Vector Labs,
Burlington, ON, Canada) for 5min and counterstained
in Mayer’s haematoxylin. The expression of PLK4 was
determined by RT-PCR, using RNA extracted from tumour
tissue with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON,
Canada), and cDNA generated using SuperScript Vilo
MasterMix (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada).
Triplicate samples were analyzed using TaqMan array fast
plates (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada), and
PLK4 expression normalized against HPRT.

order to account for differences in tumor size. To measure
effects of treatment on nuclear size, the diameter of 100
randomly-selected tumor cell nuclei was measured from
4-5 tumors per model, using the Aperio software.

Limiting dilution assays
Limiting dilution assays were performed as
described previously [14]. Briefly, animals were treated
with a single dose of 52mg/kg and tumors harvested 12h
after treatment. Single-cell suspensions were prepared, a
sample was stained using anti-mouse CD31-FITC, H2KFITC and propidium iodide, and the percentage of viable
cancer cells counted using a hemocytometer. 3-6 dilutions
of human cells were injected into the flanks of 3 NOD/
SCID mice per dilution and tumor take rate was observed
over the course of 6 months. TIC frequency was calculated
using the L-Calc software (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC).

Statistical analysis

Drug treatment

The pH3 and Ki-67 labeling, and the weights of
the tumours were compared utilizing the Mann-Whitney
test. The survival percentages were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was applied
to test the difference between treatments. Mixed effect
models, with animal as a random effect, were employed
to determine if treatment affected the diameter of tumor
cell nuclei. In order to stabilize the variance, the log
transformation was applied to tumor cell nuclei diameter.

For single treatments, animals were treated with
daily oral gavage of 7.5mg/kg CFI-400945 or saline
vehicle control for 21 days. Treatment started when
tumors were palpable at a diameter of ~5mm. Animals
were treated for three weeks, when the tumors were
excised and weighed 24 hr after the last dose in half of
each treatment group (n=4-5), with the remaining animals
(n=5-6) maintained until the humane endpoint was reached
to evaluate survival.

In addition to tumor growth inhibition, the tumors
were assessed by IHC, using paraffin sections from the
treatment and control groups. For each marker, tissue
sections from 4-5 individual tumors were analyzed.
Proliferation was assessed by extent of Ki-67 staining;
mitotic cells were identified by phosphorylated histone
H3 Serine-10 (pH3), and cells undergoing apoptosis by
cleaved caspase 3 (CC3). Tissue sections were stained for
Ki-67 (Novus-Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA, 1:1000)
for 2h or CC3 (#9661, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA,
1:500) for 30 minutes. For pH3, sections were incubated
(3077, Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, CA, 1:50) at room
temperature for 1h. Antibody-labeled sections were then
processed for IHC as above. Slides were scanned at 20x
resolution, or 40x resolution for pH3, using an Aperio
Scanscope XT scanner, and the percentage of positive
pixels determined using Aperio Imagescope software.
Cells stained for pH3 were counted manually, and
classified as prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase
based on morphology. The total number of pH3 positive
nuclei was normalized to the area of viable tumor tissue in
