Abstract
SMAD4 is localized to chromosome 18q21, a frequent site for loss of heterozygosity in advanced stage colon
cancers. Although Smad4 is regarded as a signaling mediator of the TGFb signaling pathway, its role as a major
suppressor of colorectal cancer progression and the molecular events underlying this phenomenon remain
elusive. Here, we describe the establishment and use of colon cancer cell line model systems to dissect the
functional roles of TGFb and Smad4 inactivation in the manifestation of a malignant phenotype. We found that
loss of function of Smad4 and retention of intact TGFb receptors could synergistically increase the levels of
VEGF, a major proangiogenic factor. Pharmacologic inhibition studies suggest that overactivation of the TGFbinduced MEK-Erk and p38-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) auxiliary pathways are involved in the
induction of VEGF expression in SMAD4 null cells. Overall, SMAD4 deficiency was responsible for the enhanced
migration of colon cancer cells with a corresponding increase in matrix metalloprotease 9 enhanced hypoxiainduced GLUT1 expression, increased aerobic glycolysis, and resistance to 50 -fluoruracil–mediated apoptosis.
Interestingly, Smad4 specifically interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1a under hypoxic conditions
providing a molecular basis for the differential regulation of target genes to suppress a malignant phenotype. In
summary, our results define a molecular mechanism that explains how loss of the tumor suppressor Smad4
promotes colorectal cancer progression. These findings are also consistent with targeting TGFb-induced
auxiliary pathways, such as MEK-ERK, and p38-MAPK and the glycolytic cascade, in SMAD4-deficient tumors
as attractive strategies for therapeutic intervention. Cancer Res; 71(3); 998–1008. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Colon cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer
and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States, accounting for more than 50,000 cancer deaths per year
(1). There has been significant progress in understanding the
familial predisposition to colon cancer and it has been
exploited as an excellent model to understand the multistep
progression of human cancer (2, 3). On the other hand, as the

majority of colon cancer cases are of sporadic origin and often
diagnosed at an advanced stage, it remains a major form of
cancer fatality. There has been little progress made in elucidating the molecular basis for the conversion of a benign form
of the cancer to a more malignant and metastatic form, which
accounts for the majority of colon cancer deaths. Thus, the
delineation of the key genetic and epigenetic alterations that
promote malignancy of colon cancer is important not only for
prognosis and clinical surveillance of affected individuals but
also for devising treatment strategies to block the dissemination of cancer cells and to effectively eradicate tumors.
Resistance to growth inhibition by TGFb is common in a
variety of human cancers, emphasizing the importance of
intracellular pathways mediated by this polypeptide to the
neoplastic process (4, 5). Early investigations to understand
the molecular basis of this resistance were concentrated at the
level of TGFb receptors and uncovered, lack of expression
(6–8) and inactivation by point mutations of the TGFb receptor type II (RII; refs. 9–11). Subsequently, evidence for TGFb
receptor type I (RI) mutations was also reported (12). A major
breakthrough in understanding the genetic basis of TGFb
insensitivity to growth emerged with the isolation of the
SMAD4 gene as a target tumor suppressor gene localized to
frequent homozygous deletions affecting 18q21.1 in pancreatic carcinomas (13). Because loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at
chromosome 18q has long been established as a late event

Smad4 Inactivation Promotes Malignancy in Colon Cancer

during colon cancer progression (2), our studies were the first
to report that SMAD4 mutations or deletions occurred in 30%
of colon cancers that exhibited LOH for chromosome 18q (14).
Additional confirmations in numerous follow-up studies also
showed that a high frequency of LOH at 18q was associated
with an increase in the frequency of SMAD4, and less frequently SMAD2 or DCC mutations (14–17).
When tumors corresponding to different stages of colon
cancer were interrogated for SMAD4 inactivation arising from
deletions or point mutations, there was a strong correlation
between the higher frequency of SMAD4 gene mutations and
distant metastases relative to nonmetastatic forms of colon
cancer (14, 15, 18–21). Additional credence was also derived
from studies with mouse models where a dramatic increase in
malignant progression of intestinal polyps in cis-compound
heterozygotes (i.e., APCþ/SMAD4þ/compared with the simple APCþ/ heterozygotes) was observed (22, 23). Overall,
studies using both human tumors and animal models corroborated the notion that disabling TGFb signaling pathway at
the level of Smad4 may be a critical late event in multistep
colon cancer progression.
Here, we provide molecular evidence supporting that
genetic defects in SMAD4 and increased TGFb levels in colon
cancer cells are associated with transition to malignancy with
the acquisition of angiogenic and metastatic potential. These
findings form a molecular basis for the creation of model
systems harboring a SMAD4 defect to aid in the discovery of
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for colon cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
Isogenic HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ and SMAD4/ colon cancer
cell lines [a kind gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD)] were maintained in McCoy's 5A
medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/mL G418, 0.1 mg/mL
hygromycin B and 10% FBS. SW620 colon cancer cell line
and 293FT cell line were obtained from ATCC (American Type
Culture Collection) and were maintained in DMEM
(Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. Whenever necessary, cells were cultured in a
Napco 8000WJ hypoxic incubator (Thermo) to maintain
hypoxic (1% O2) conditions.
Antibodies and reagents
The following antibodies and reagents were used in this
study: VEGF (BD Biosciences), Smad4 (Santa Cruz), anti-HA
(Roche), b-actin and anti-Flag (Sigma), Smad2, P-Smad2, Erk,
P-Erk (p42/44), Akt, P-Akt, p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), p-p38MAPK and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling)
and GLUT1 (Abcam). We also used protein A/G agarose beads
(Santa Cruz), inhibitors for MEK (PD98059) and p38 MAPK
(SB203580; Calbiochem) and 50 -fluorouracil (50 -FU; Sigma).
Plasmid construction
To generate the pBabe-puro-TGFbRII-HA plasmid,
TGFbRII-HA cDNA was excised from pCEP4-Zeo/HygTGFbRII-HA plasmid (24), using BamHI/HindIII digestion

www.aacrjournals.org

followed by Klenow enzyme reaction to generate a bluntend DNA fragment and then ligated into SnaBI-digested,
pBabe-puro vector. To generate the pBabe-puro-Smad4-Flag
plasmid, Smad4-Flag cDNA was excised from a PRK5-Smad4Flag plasmid (25) using EcoRI/HindIII digestion followed
by Klenow enzyme reaction and then ligated into SnaBIdigested pBabe-puro vector. All plasmids were verified by
DNA sequencing.
Viral production and infection of target cells
Retrovirus was generated by cotransfection of pBabe-puro
empty vector or pBabe-puro-Smad4-Flag or pBabe-puroTGFbRII-HA along with pVSV-G (envelope) and pVSV-GP
(packaging) plasmids in 293FT cells. Target cells were infected
overnight with 4 mL of virus-containing medium in the
presence of 10 mg/mL polybrene. The next day, cells were
cultured in fresh medium and allowed to grow for another
24 hours. After replacing with fresh medium, cells were
selected with 2 mg/mL puromycin for 7 to 10 days, pooled,
and used for further assays.
Western blotting
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described (26).
Transient transfections and luciferase reporter assays
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning) overnight prior
to transfection. Transfections of firefly luciferase reporter and
Renilla luciferase (internal control) plasmids were performed
using Fugene (Roche). Transfected cells were allowed to grow
overnight prior to TGFb treatments. Firefly luciferase reporter
activity was measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay kit
(Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol, using a
Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences) at 570 nm.
Expression was calculated as the ratio of arbitrary firefly
luciferase units normalized to Renilla luciferase. These experiments were independently repeated three times and each
treatment consisted of triplicate samples.
Drug and inhibitor treatments
HCT116 cells were seeded in 6-well or 12-well plates 24
hours prior to any treatment. Cells were pretreated 30 minutes
before the beginning of each experiment with 20 mmol/L of
MEK inhibitor (PD98059), 20 mmol/L of p38 MAPK inhibitor
(SB203580; Calbiochem) or 1 mg/mL 50 fluorouracil (Sigma).
Wound-healing assays
Cells were grown to confluency and a wound was introduced using a sterile Q-tip. The ability of cells to migrate was
monitored at different time points using a light microscope.
Images were captured using a Nikon E4300 digital camera to
monitor the cell migration rate.
ELISA assays
Cells were seeded and allowed to grow for 24 hours. Culture
medium was replaced with serum-free medium and cells were
allowed to grow for another 36 hours. After collecting the
conditioned medium, cells were washed again with 1 mL of

serum-free medium, pH 5.0, to enhance the release of VEGF
bound to the VEGF receptors on the cell membrane. This
medium was pooled with the previously harvested conditioned medium and concentrated 5 times by centrifugation
(7,500  g for 15 minutes) using an Amicon 50K filter unit
(Millipore). Secreted VEGF was quantified using a human
VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Lactate assay
Equal numbers of HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ and SMAD4/ cells
were plated and allowed to grow for 24 hours under normoxic
conditions. The amount of lactate in the culture media
secreted by the cells was measured using a lactate assay kit
(Biovision), according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Oxygen consumption assay
The oxygen consumption rates were measured as described
in Supplementary Methods.
Zymogram assays
Conditioned medium from cells was collected as described
above. The activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMP) was
assessed by resolving the concentrated conditioned media on
10% gelatin native zymogram gels (Novex) followed by Coomassie blue staining.
Protein coimmunoprecipitation
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed
following cotransfection of PRK5-Smad4-Flag along with
pCDNA3-HIF1aAA (hypoxia-inducible factor) or pCDNA3HIF2aAA vectors in HCT116 cells. Cells were cultured under
1% O2 conditions for 5 hours and then were lysed in ice-cold
RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (50 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L of NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mmol/L of EDTA), containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Immunoprecipitation was performed using either anti-mouse IgG or antiFlag antibodies in 300 mL total cell lysate using 30 mL protein
A/G-agarose beads followed by overnight incubation at 4 C.
The immune complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL lysis
buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed paired t test was performed for statistical analysis of luciferase assays. A P value of less than 0.05 [indicated
by the asterisk (*) in respective figs.] was considered statistically significant. Error bars represent  SE values.

Results
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive colon
cancer progression to malignancy and metastasis, we
hypothesized that loss of Smad4 function along with TGFb
overexpression and intact TGFbRII contribute to the acquisition of malignant properties of colon cancer cells. Here, we
describe the use of model cell lines to dissect the molecular
basis for angiogenic and metastatic phenotypic properties

resulting from SMAD4 deficiency that promote colon cancer
progression.
Development and characterization of colon cancer cell
line model systems
To test our hypothesis, we first generated appropriate colon
cancer cell line model systems. We used 2 independent colon
cancer cell lines, HCT116 and SW620, to examine the contribution of SMAD4 defect in colon cancer.
First, we took advantage of a pair of isogenic HCT116 cells
that are either SMAD4 proficient (þ/þ) or deficient (/),
due to somatic deletions of both SMAD4 alleles engineered by
homologous recombination (24). Because these isogenic
HCT116 cell lines harbor a mutation in the TGFbRII, which
inactivates its kinase activity (27), we stably restored the
expression of wild-type TGFbRII using retroviral gene transduction. The following stable colon cancer cell lines were
generated: HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ pBabe and pBabe-TGFbRII-HA
as well as the isogenic SMAD4/ pBabe and pBabe-TGFbRIIHA (Fig. 1A).
Secondly, we stably restored the expression of wild-type
Smad4 in the SW620 colon cancer cell line, with previously
reported metastatic potential (28), as these cells harbor a
deletion and a nonsense mutation in each of the 2 SMAD4
alleles. In both systems, TGFbRII and Smad4 expression were
verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1A and C) and the restoration of an intact TGFb signaling pathway was confirmed by
Smad-binding element luciferase (SBE4-Luc) reporter assays
(Fig. 1B and D). Treatment of HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ pB-RII and
SW620-pBSmad4 cells with TGFb resulted in transactivation
of the luciferase reporter. These steps enabled us to generate 2
isogenic pairs of in vitro model systems ideal to study the
relationship between TGFb signaling and/or SMAD4 status
and the malignant properties of colon cancer cells.
Smad4 suppresses VEGF expression in colon cancer
cells
To investigate the expression of genes involved in the
biological effects of Smad4-mediated suppression of colorectal
tumorigenesis, we first examined the effects of Smad4 on the
expression of VEGF, a well-established regulator of angiogenesis and metastasis, overexpressed in a wide variety of human
tumors (29, 30).
We performed VEGF-Luc reporter assays in the HCT116 cell
line model system to assess the effects of Smad4 and TGFbRII
status on VEGF transcription. On treatment with TGFb
following serum starvation, HCT116 SMAD4/ cells with
restored TGFbRII expression exhibited increased VEGF promoter activity compared with the SMAD4þ/þ cells (Fig. 2A, i).
These results were also consistent with the VEGF protein
levels (Fig. 2A, ii). To independently confirm these findings, we
also used the SW620 system. As predicted, restoring Smad4
expression in these cells resulted in significantly reduced
VEGF promoter activity (Fig. 2B, i) and corresponding reduction in VEGF protein levels (Fig. 2B, ii).
Because VEGF is a secreted growth factor which can
mediate the angiogenic program of tumors in an autocrine
and paracrine fashion, we hypothesized that SMAD4-deficient

cells secrete more VEGF compared with SMAD4-proficient
cells. ELISA assays confirmed that restoration of Smad4
expression in SW620 caused the suppression of VEGF secretion (Fig. 2C). Overall, these studies demonstrated that Smad4
suppresses VEGF expression in the colon cancer cells.
Activation of auxiliary signaling pathways by TGFb
results in VEGF upregulation in SMAD4-deficient cells
It is well known that TGFb can potently activate Smaddependent as well as Smad-independent signaling pathways
(31). Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of Smad4 loss
on VEGF expression might be mediated through activation of
auxiliary signaling pathways. To test this, we examined the
effects of Smad4 and TGFbRII status on the kinetics of TGFbactivated signaling pathways. The 4 groups of HCT116 cells
(proficient and deficient in Smad4 and with or without
TGFbRII restoration) were serum-starved overnight and then
treated with TGFb for various time points as indicated in
Figure 3. The kinetics of the major downstream TGFb-activated signaling pathways that have been shown to be involved
in cancer progression was determined by Western blotting.
We observed increased phosphorylated MAPK and Smad2 in
the presence of RII indicating the likely reconstitution of
auxiliary signaling pathways. Interestingly, TGFb treatment
caused prolonged activation of the MEK-Erk pathway in the
SMAD4/ cells compared with the SMAD4þ/þ cells in a
TGFbRII status–independent manner (Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore, the retention of wild-type TGFbRII appeared to be
necessary for the TGFb-induced activation of the p38-MAPK

www.aacrjournals.org

pathway in both SMAD4þ/þ and SMAD4/ cells and exhibited
a much earlier activation in the SMAD4-deficient cells compared with SMAD4-proficient cells in response to TGFb
(Fig. 3A and B). Although the MEK-Erk pathway remained
consistently overactive, a similar early activation of the p38MAPK pathway was also observed in the SMAD4-deficient
SW620 cells in response to TGFb (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
hyperactivity of the MEK-Erk pathway in both SMAD4-deficient and SMAD4-proficient SW620 cells may be derived from
other genetic differences between SW620 and HCT116.
Both MEK-Erk and p38-MAPK pathways have been implicated in the regulation of VEGF expression in cancer cells
(32, 33). As our data suggested that these pathways become
overactive in SMAD4-deficient colon cancer cells in response
to TGFb, we decided to test whether VEGF upregulation is
mediated through these signaling cascades. We found that
pharmacologic inhibition of MEK-Erk and p38-MAPK pathways in SMAD4/ cells suppressed VEGF promoter activity,
as indicated by VEGF-Luc reporter assays (Fig. 3C and D).
Consistent with our signaling pathway kinetics data, treatment with the MEK inhibitor suppressed VEGF activation
in both SMAD4/ pB and SMAD4/ pBTGFbRII cells
(Fig. 3C), whereas p38-MAPK inhibition suppressed VEGF
expression only in the SMAD4/ pBTGFbRII cells (Fig. 3D).
In conclusion, these studies suggest that SMAD4 defect in
the presence of functional TGFbRII results in an increase in
VEGF expression caused, at least in part, by TGFb-induced
overactivation of the MEK-Erk and p38-MAPK signaling
pathways.

TGFb. Secreted VEGF was quantified by ELISA assay for VEGF in the conditioned media collected from each cell line. Results are presented as the
average of triplicate measurements.

SMAD4 defect causes increases in cell motility and
matrix metalloprotease 9 activity
To evaluate the effects of Smad4 deficiency on the migratory
properties of colon cancer cells, we performed wound-healing
assays. We found that HCT116 SMAD4/ cells migrated into
the cell-free areas and completely closed the wound in 40 hours,
whereas the migration rate of HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ cell was
significantly reduced (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the accelerated
migration of SMAD4-deficient cells appeared to be independent
of the status of TGFbRII (Fig. 4A and B). Because SMAD4 defect

1002

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

was found to enhance TGFb-induced Erk phosphorylation
(Fig. 3A), we hypothesized that overactivation of this pathway
might be involved in the acquisition of promigratory properties.
Consistent with this notion, treatment of SMAD4/ cells with
MEK inhibitor suppressed the cell migration (Fig. 4A and B).
These data suggest that SMAD4 defect enhances the migration
rate of HCT116 cells and that activation of the MEK-Erk pathway might be involved in this process.
The invasion of cancer cells from the primary tumor site
into the blood stream, a process known as intravasation, is a

critical step required for the metastatic dissemination. It
could be aided not only by the acquisition of a more migratory
phenotype, but also through the upregulation of MMP
enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular
matrix. To test whether SMAD4 status affects the activity of
such enzymes, we performed zymogram assays using conditioned media from the parental SMAD4-deficient and SMAD4reconstituted SW620 cells. Restoration of Smad4 expression
suppressed the matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) activity in
these cells (Fig. 4C) supporting the notion that Smad4 acts to

SMAD4 defect suppresses hypoxia-induced cell death,
induces aerobic glycolysis, and promotes 50 fluorouracil resistance of colon cancer cells
Because increased glycolytic rates have been correlated
with chemoresistance of colon cancer cells (34), we hypothesized that loss of Smad4 might affect the expression of
enzymes associated with the glycolytic pathway under hypoxic

conditions that mimic the microenvironment of advanced
tumors. Indeed, SMAD4-deficient cells exhibited higher levels
of the major glucose transporter GLUT1, but not hexokinase,
when cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, compared with SMAD4-proficient cells (Fig. 5A, i). In addition,
SMAD4-deficient cells secrete significantly higher levels of
lactate compared with SMAD4þ/þ cells (Fig. 5A, ii) indicating
an enhanced rate of aerobic glycolysis. Interestingly, we also
found that Smad4 physically interacts with HIF1a, but not
HIF2a, under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5B) suggesting that it
may negatively regulate HIF1a-mediated GLUT1 expression.
Furthermore, this phenomenon was also not associated with
altered oxygen consumption rate (Supplementary Fig. S2)
indicating that mitochondrial function and oxidative respiration is not involved. Consistent with these findings, SMAD4null cells were resistant to hypoxia-induced cell death compared with their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5C). Overall,
these observations suggested that the increase in GLUT1
protein levels, due to SMAD4 loss, may be correlated to an
increased rate of aerobic glycolysis and survival under hypoxic
conditions.
On the basis of these observations and the literature
suggesting that chromosome 18q loss results in resistance
to a commonly used drug for colorectal cancer treatment,
50 -fluorouracil (50 -FU; ref. 35), we hypothesized that SMAD4

1004

deficiency might be responsible for this effect. Treatment of
HCT116 SMAD4þ/þ cells with 50 -FU for 72 hours resulted in
profound induction of apoptosis, corroborated by the presence of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5D, i and ii). On the contrary,
there was almost undetectable level of apoptosis in SMAD4/
cells suggesting that SMAD4 defect results in the acquisition
of 50 -FU resistance in colon cancer (Fig. 5D, i and ii).

Discussion
TGFb overexpression and SMAD4 mutations or deletions
have been directly correlated with colon cancer metastasis.
Several pathologic and genetic studies suggested that chromosome 18q loss is a critical event during colorectal cancer
progression and that the SMAD4 tumor suppressor is the
primary target for inactivation (2, 14). Subsequent reports
have established that allelic loss of chromosome 18q is
directly correlated with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer
and poor prognosis (36, 37). Despite the strong genetic
evidence for the association between SMAD4 inactivation
and advanced stage of colon cancer, the molecular basis
remains elusive.
To examine if SMAD4 inactivation is a major switch that
favors tumor malignancy and propensity for angiogenesis and
metastasis of colon cancer, we elected to use cell line model

systems to investigate both the molecular basis and cellular
properties associated with SMAD4 inactivation and concurrent increase in the TGFb levels, conditions that mimic
advanced stage colorectal tumors. Because the pairs of cell
lines studied are genetically identical, except for their SMAD4
status, we reasoned that comparing the properties and gene
expression patterns should help to better understand the role
of SMAD4 in tumor malignancy.
Here, we show that Smad4 loss enhances VEGF expression
synergistically with increased levels of TGFb, whereas expression of Smad4 suppresses VEGF levels in colon cancer cells.
These results are consistent with a previous report using the
pancreatic cancer cell line, Hs766T, harboring homozygous
deletion in both SMAD4 alleles, in which the restoration of
Smad4 expression was found to suppress angiogenesis and
xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting VEGF expression (38).
We also found that SMAD4 deficiency prolonged TGFbmediated Erk phosphorylation and activation in HCT116 cells.
The fact that Erk signaling is initially activated by TGFb and
eventually turned off at 24 hours in SMAD4þ/þ cells, suggests
that a phosphatase may act to revert phosphorylation to the
basal levels. Our results are also consistent with hyperactivation of Ras-mediated Erk signaling and progression into
undifferentiated carcinoma upon inhibition of Smad4 in
transformed keratinocytes (39).

Interestingly, our data also showed that increased TGFbmediated activation of MEK-Erk and p38-MAPK pathways
combined with SMAD4 loss, at least in part, mediates VEGF
upregulation. This is in agreement with studies showing that
Erk kinase is required for VEGF upregulation in colon carcinoma cells upon serum starvation (32) as well as that
p38-MAPK activation by heregulin-b-1 is required for VEGF
induction in endothelial cells (33). Our studies also found that
SMAD4 inactivation in colon cancer cells enhances their
migratory and invasive properties consistent with a previous
report showing that restoration of Smad4 expression reversed
the invasive phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells (40).
Clinical studies have shown that patients retaining heterozygosity at the 18q locus benefit significantly better from
treatment with 50 fluorouracil than patients with LOH at this
site (34). Moreover, chromosome 18q loss and absence of
TGFbRII mutations were found to correlate with low survival rates in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
(41). These clinical data are consistent with our findings
using HCT116 cells harboring SMAD4 loss and intact
TGFbRII status, which cooperate to induce VEGF expression. Other studies also showed a direct correlation between
low levels of Smad4 in tumors and worse outcome following
surgery and treatment with 50 -fluorouracil in colon cancer
patients (42).

Figure 6. SMAD4 inactivation
promotes transition to malignancy
in colon cancer. Transition of
premalignant colon cancer cells to
malignancy is blocked by
functional Smad4 due to inhibition
of transcription factors (TF), such
as the HIF1a, or other molecular
events that are activated
downstream of
oncogenic signaling pathways
and cross-talking TGFb signaling
events involved in promoting
malignant properties. The
inactivation of Smad4 during
colon cancer progression
removes the block in transition
from the premalignant to the
malignant stage by allowing
accumulation of factors such as
GLUT1 and VEGF.

Smad4 Inactivation Promotes Malignancy in Colon Cancer

Elevated glycolytic rates, even under normoxic conditions, also known as the "Warburg effect" (43), have been
correlated with the acquisition of chemoresistance in cancer
cells (44, 45) and HIF1a is established as a major transcriptional regulator of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (46).
Interestingly, we found that SMAD4-deficient cells exhibit
increased levels of GLUT1 expression and lactate secretion as
well as resistance to 50 -FU–mediated apoptosis. Because
SMAD4 deficiency did not affect oxidative respiration (Supplementary Fig. S1), we conclude that increased glycolysis aided by
the robust glucose transport contributes to the enhanced
survival of these cells. The fact that there was physical interaction between Smad4 and HIF1a suggests a mechanistic basis for
these observations. On the basis of these findings, we propose
that Smad4 may negatively regulate HIF1a-induced GLUT1
expression and the rate of aerobic glycolysis, providing a molecular link to explain the acquisition of chemoresistance in
colorectal tumors harboring chromosome 18q deficiency
(Fig. 6).
In summary, our studies provide direct evidence for a
molecular basis to explain an association between a Smad4
defect and progression to malignant colon cancer (Fig. 6). The

model systems described here may help to uncover novel
biomarkers for advanced stage colon cancer to improve
prognostic evaluations and identify effective targets for therapeutic intervention.
