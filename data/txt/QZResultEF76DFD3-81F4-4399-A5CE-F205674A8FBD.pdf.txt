ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that harbor an oncogenic KRAS mutation are
often associated with resistance to targeted therapies. The MUC1-C transmembrane
protein is aberrantly overexpressed in NSCLCs and confers a poor outcome; however,
the functional role for MUC1-C in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells has remained unclear. The
present studies demonstrate that silencing MUC1-C in A549/KRAS(G12S) and H460/
KRAS(Q61H) NSCLC cells is associated with downregulation of AKT signaling and
inhibition of growth. Overexpression of a MUC1-C(CQC→AQA) mutant, which inhibits
MUC1-C homodimerization and function, suppressed both AKT and MEK activation.
Moreover, treatment with GO-203, an inhibitor of MUC1-C homodimerization, blocked
AKT and MEK signaling and decreased cell survival. The results further demonstrate
that targeting MUC1-C suppresses expression of the ZEB1 transcriptional repressor
by an AKT-mediated mechanism, and in turn induces miR-200c. In concert with these
effects on the ZEB1/miR-200c regulatory loop, targeting MUC1-C was associated with
reversal of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibition of self-renewal
capacity. Loss of MUC1-C function also attenuated KRAS independence and inhibited
growth of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells as tumors in mice. These findings support a model
in which targeting MUC1-C inhibits mutant KRAS signaling in NSCLC cells and thereby
reverses the EMT phenotype and decreases self-renewal.

lung adenocarcinomas [2] and this strategy is being
evaluated for the treatment of patients with mutant KRAS
NSCLC. Other potential targets for inhibiting growth
of mutant KRAS NSCLC cells have been identified in
synthetic lethal RNAi and drug screens. For example,
the non-canonical IκB kinase TBK1 and downstream
NF-κB signals are essential for survival of mutant KRAS
NSCLC cells [3]. GATA2 and CDK4 have also been
shown to be of importance for the growth and survival of
NSCLC cells expressing mutant KRAS [4, 5]. In a small
molecule screen, mutant KRAS NSCLC cells were more
sensitive to inhibition of the RAF→MEK→ERK pathway
as compared to KRAS wild-type cells [6]. By contrast,
such selectivity for KRAS mutant cells was not observed

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 25% of patients with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbor an oncogenic KRAS
mutation that is often associated with resistance to
conventional and targeted therapies [1]. NSCLC cells
expressing activated KRAS are therefore potential targets
for KRAS inhibitors. However, pharmacologic inhibition
of mutant KRAS has not as yet proven successful, a
situation that has necessitated a focus on therapeutic
approaches using inhibitors of the downstream AKT and
MEK pathways. In this context, concurrent inhibition of
AKT and MEK signaling has been shown to be effective
in inducing regressions of mutant Kras-driven murine

with inhibitors of the PI3K→AKT→mTOR pathway [6].
Notably, not all NSCLC cells expressing mutant
KRAS are dependent on KRAS for survival [7]. In this
context, KRAS-dependent NSCLC cells exhibit a welldifferentiated phenotype, whereas KRAS-independent
cells are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [7]. Treatment of KRAS-dependent
NSCLC cells with TGFβ1, an inducer of EMT, reduces
dependence on KRAS, further indicating that EMT
contributes to KRAS independence [7]. These findings
and the demonstration that sensitivity of NSCLC cells to
EGFR inhibitors is inhibited by EMT [8] have supported
an association between EMT and loss of oncogene
addiction.
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane heterodimeric
protein that is aberrantly expressed in NSCLCs. Over
80% of NSCLCs of the adenocarcinoma subtype express
MUC1 at high levels [9]. In addition, the overexpression
of MUC1 in NSCLC is associated with poor diseasefree and overall survival [9–13]. Of importance to
understanding its function in NSCLC, MUC1 is translated
as a single polypeptide that undergoes autocleavage
into two subunits that, in turn, form a stable noncovalent heterodimer at the cell surface [14]. The MUC1
N-terminal subunit (MUC1-N) contains glycosylated
tandem repeats that are characteristic of the mucin family.
The MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) is a singlepass transmembrane protein that interacts with receptor
tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR and others [14]. Moreover,
the MUC1-C 72 amino acid cytoplasmic tail contains
multiple phosphorylation sites and interacts with diverse
effectors that have been linked to transformation [14].
For example, MUC1-C contributes to activation of the
canonical NF-κB pathway by constitutively interacting
with the IκB kinase (IKK) complex in cancer cells and
in the response to inflammatory cytokine stimulation of
non-malignant epithelial cells [15]. MUC1-C also binds
directly to NF-κB p65 and promotes NF-κB-mediated
gene transcription [16]. The available evidence in breast
cancer cells indicates that involvement of MUC1-C in
NF-κB signaling is linked to the induction of EMT and
self-renewal [17, 18]. In this way, MUC1-C occupies
the ZEB1 promoter with NF-κB and thereby promotes
ZEB1 transcription [17]. In turn, MUC1-C associates
with ZEB1 and the MUC1-C/ZEB1 complex suppresses
transcription of miR-200c, an inducer of epithelial
differentiation [17]. MUC1-C also induces breast cancer
cell sphere formation, a characteristic that is associated
with EMT and self-renewing stem cells, by an NF-κBdependent mechanism [18]. To our knowledge, there is
nothing known about involvement of MUC1-C in EMT or
self-renewal of NSCLC cells. In addition, there have been
no reports linking MUC1-C to KRAS addiction in lung or
other cancer cells.

The overexpression of MUC1 in NSCLCs and other
types of carcinomas has supported the attractiveness of
MUC1-N and MUC1-C as potential cancer targets [19].
In this context, underglycosylation of the MUC1-N
tandem repeats in tumor cells, as compared to normal
epithelia, provided the basis for targeting MUC1-N
with antibodies and vaccines [14]. Additionally, the
oncogenic MUC1-C subunit contains a CQC motif in
the cytoplasmic domain that is necessary and sufficient
for MUC1-C homodimerization and function [20, 21].
Notably in this regard, expression of MUC1-C with
mutation of the CQC motif to AQA blocks anchorageindependent growth and tumorigenicity of cancer cells,
consistent with a dominant-negative effect [20, 22].
Based on those observations, cell-penetrating peptides,
such as GO-203, were developed to target the MUC1-C
CQC motif and inhibit MUC1-C-mediated survival
mechanisms [23, 24]. Accordingly, targeting MUC1-C
in cancer cells is achievable by several approaches that
include (i) silencing with shRNAs, (ii) expression of the
MUC1-C(CQC→AQA) mutant, and (iii) treatment with
GO-203. Using these approaches, the present studies
demonstrate that MUC1-C is of functional importance to
KRAS dependency in NSCLC cells that harbor activating
KRAS mutations. The results show that MUC1-C drives
EMT and thereby confers stemness. Targeting MUC1-C
thus reverses EMT and inhibits self-renewal in mutant
KRAS NSCLC cells.

RESULTS
Silencing MUC1-C suppresses AKT in NSCLC
cells with activating KRAS mutations
Human A549 NSCLC cells harbor the KRAS(G12S)
mutation [25]. To assess the potential involvement of
MUC1-C in activated KRAS signaling, A549 cells were
infected with lentiviruses expressing a control CshRNA
or one targeting MUC1-C (MUC1shRNA) (Fig. 1A).
In A549/MUC1shRNA cells, we found that silencing
MUC1-C results in decreased phosphorylation of AKT
and the downstream effector S6K (Fig. 1B, left), but has
no apparent effect on MEK and ERK activation (Fig. 1B,
right). Silencing MUC1-C was also associated with a
slowing of cell growth (Fig. 1C). To extend this analysis,
H460/KRAS(Q61H) NSCLC cells were infected to stably
express the CshRNA or MUC1shRNA (Fig. 1D). H460
cells similarly responded to downregulation of MUC1-C
with suppression of AKT and S6K activation (Fig. 1E,
left). Moreover, p-MEK and p-ERK levels were increased,
consistent with a potential compensatory feedback
response to decreases in AKT activity (Fig. 1E, right).
As found for A549 cells, silencing MUC1-C resulted in
inhibition of H460 cell growth (Fig. 1F).

Targeting MUC1-C inhibits AKT and MEK
signaling in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells

associated with suppression of AKT and S6K activation
(Fig. 2B, right). In addition and in contrast to silencing
MUC1-C, expression of MUC1-C(AQA) resulted in
downregulation of MEK→ERK activation (Fig. 2B, right).
MUC1-C(AQA) also inhibited A549 cell growth (Fig. 2C).
The MUC1-C inhibitor, GO-203, is a cell penetrating
peptide that contains a poly-Arg transduction domain
linked to CQCRRKN (Fig. 2A). GO-203 blocks MUC1-C
homodimerization and thereby its oncogenic function
[21, 24]. Treatment of A549 cells with GO-203 was
associated with transient downregulation of p-AKT levels
at 3–9 h and then reactivation at 24 h (Fig. 2D, left and

The MUC1-C subunit includes a 72 amino acid (aa)

motif to AQA acts as a dominant-negative of MUC1-C
function [22]. Accordingly, MUC1-C or MUC1-C(AQA)
was stably overexpressed in A549 cells to assess the effects
of the mutant (Fig. 2B, left). As found with MUC1-C
silencing, overexpression of MUC1-C(AQA) was

suppression of AKT activation at 48 h (Fig. 2D, left and
right). Moreover and like MUC1-C(AQA), we found that
GO-203 inhibits MEK→ERK activation (Fig. 2D, left
and right). GO-203 was also highly effective in inhibiting
survival of A549 cells (Fig. 2E). By contrast, treatment
with a control peptide CP-2 (Fig. 2A), that is inactive in
inhibiting MUC1-C [21], had no effect on (i) AKT activity
(Supplemental Fig. S1A) or (ii) loss of clonogenic survival
(Fig. 2E). As confirmation of these findings, treatment of
H460 cells with GO-203, but not CP-2 (Supplemental
Fig. S1B), was similarly associated with suppression of
AKT and MEK/ERK signaling (Supplemental Fig. S2A)
and loss of survival (Supplemental Fig. S2B).

A549 and H460 cells exhibit an EMT phenotype,
which is a characteristic of importance for KRAS
independence [7]. To determine if MUC1-C regulates
EMT in these NSCLC cells, we first studied the effects
of silencing MUC1-C on expression of the ZEB1
transcription factor and inducer of the mesenchymal
phenotype [26]. Downregulation of MUC1-C in A549
cells was associated with marked suppression of ZEB1
levels (Fig. 3A). In H460 cells, ZEB1 expression
was also decreased in response to MUC1-C silencing
(Fig. 3B). In addition, we found that silencing MUC1-C
suppresses ZEB1 mRNA levels in A549 and H460 cells

Silencing MUC1-C reverses EMT and KRAS
independence

(Figs. 3C and D), consistent with involvement of
MUC1-C in upregulating ZEB1 transcription. In
contrast to the KRAS-independent A549 and H460
cells and consistent with previous observations [7],
there was no detectable ZEB1 expression in the KRASdependent H358 and H441 cells (data now shown).
Activation of AKT has been linked to the induction
of ZEB1 expression [27, 28]. In concert with those
observations and the demonstration that targeting
MUC1-C suppresses AKT and ZEB1, we found that
inhibiting AKT with GSK690693 is associated with
downregulation of ZEB1 in A549 and H460 cells
(Figs. 3E and F). Moreover and consistent with ZEB1mediated suppression of miR-200c [26], we found that
silencing MUC1-C is associated with induction of miR200c levels (Figs. 3G and H). These findings provided
support for a model in which MUC1-C contributes to the
activation of AKT and thereby the coordinate induction
of ZEB1 and suppression of miR-200c expression.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miR-200c is an inducer of epithelial
differentiation [26]. Thus, with the suppression of ZEB1
and induction of miR-200c, silencing MUC1-C in A549
cells was associated with upregulation of E-cadherin, and
decreases in N-cadherin and vimentin, consistent with
reversal of EMT (Fig. 4A). In H460 cells, E-cadherin was
not detectable in the absence or presence of MUC1-C
silencing. However, downregulation of MUC1-C resulted
in decreased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin
(Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when A549 and
H460 cells were treated with the AKT inhibitor, linking
suppression of AKT to the reversal of EMT (Figs. 4C
and D). In addition, to confirm that the downregulation
of ZEB1 in response to MUC1-C silencing is also
responsible for reversing EMT, we silenced ZEB1 and
found induction of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition

vimentin (Figs. 4E and F). EMT has been linked to
KRAS independence in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells [7].
Accordingly, we asked if silencing MUC1-C converts
KRAS independence to dependence on KRAS for
survival. Indeed, the downregulation of KRAS in A549/
MUC1shRNA cells was associated with increases in
caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 4G, left) and cell death (Fig. 4G,
right) as compared to that obtained for A549/CshRNA
cells. Similar results were obtained in studies of H460/
CshRNA and H460/MUC1shRNA cells with suppression
of KRAS expression (Fig. 4H, left and right), indicating
that MUC1-C contributes to KRAS independence.

in A549 cells was associated with decreases in ZEB1
(Fig. 5A, left and right) and upregulation of miR-200c
expression (Fig. 5B). In addition, the A549/MUC1C(AQA) cells exhibited reversal of EMT, as evidenced
by increases in E-cadherin and suppression of N-cadherin
and vimentin (Fig. 5C). Treatment of A549 cells with
GO-203 also decreased ZEB1 mRNA and increased miR200c levels (Figs. 5D and E). Moreover, GO-203 treatment
was associated with the acquisition of an epithelial
phenotype (Fig. 5F). Thus, inhibition of MUC1-C
function with different approaches supported the notion
that MUC1-C drives EMT in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells.

of A549 spheres (Fig. 6A, left). However, downregulation
of MUC1-C expression significantly decreased the sphere

As noted above and in addition to MUC1-C
silencing, we studied the effects of targeting MUC1-C

CP-2, blocked sphere formation (Fig. 6C, left and

and then treated with peptide, GO-203 was effective in
disrupting the spheres, whereas CP-2 had little if any

we also found that (i) MUC1-C silencing (Fig. 6E, left

right) are associated with suppression of sphere formation.
In addition, GO-203 was effective in conferring the
disruption of established H460 spheres (Fig. 6G, left and

of MUC1-C in self-renewal of A549 and H460 cells.

To extend the findings that MUC1-C promotes
self-renewal, we investigated the effects of silencing
MUC1-C on tumorigenicity of A549 cells. Consistent
with the decreased capacity for sphere formation, growth
of A549/MUC1shRNA cells was significantly inhibited as
compared to that found for A549/CshRNA cells (Fig. 7A).
As found in in vitro studies, immunoblot analysis of the
A549 tumors further showed that MUC1-C silencing is
associated with downregulation of ZEB1, increases in
E-cadherin, and decreases in N-cadherin and vimentin
(Fig. 7B). Growth of H460 cells as tumor xenografts
was also slowed as a consequence of MUC1-C silencing

consistent with the MET phenotype (Fig. 7D).

KRAS signaling. To address this issue, we used three
strategies to inhibit MUC1-C function and thereby
assess effects on the KRAS downstream AKT and MEK
pathways. Consistent with a direct interaction between
the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain and PI3K [24, 31], we
found that silencing MUC1-C NSCLC cells harboring
mutant KRAS is associated with downregulation of the
AKT pathway, but has no apparent effect on MEK→ERK
signaling. The MUC1-C oncogenic function is dependent
on the formation of MUC1-C homodimers through
a CQC motif in the cytoplasmic domain [14, 32].
Interestingly and as a second approach, stable expression
of a MUC1-C(CQC→AQA) mutant, which acts as a
dominant-negative of MUC1-C function [22], resulted

DISCUSSION
Targeting mutant KRAS in NSCLC and other
types of tumors with small molecule inhibitors has been
unsuccessful to date [1]. Therapeutic approaches have
therefore focused on the downstream AKT and MEK
pathways which can confer dependence on mutant
KRAS for survival [1]. The MUC1-C oncoprotein is
aberrantly expressed in NSCLC and is associated with
poor clinical outcomes [12, 13]; however, little was
known about whether MUC1-C contributes to mutant

in suppression of both AKT and MEK. As a third
approach, treatment with the GO-203 inhibitor, which
binds to the MUC1-C CQC site and blocks MUC1-C
homodimerization, also suppressed both AKT and MEK
activity. In contrast to targeting the MUC1-C CQC motif
with the MUC1-C(AQA) mutant or GO-203, the absence
of MEK downregulation in response to stable MUC1-C
silencing may represent a compensatory response to
suppression of AKT, as has been observed in other settings
[33]. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that inhibiting
MUC1-C in several different ways is associated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suppression of key pathways that reside downstream of
mutant KRAS and are necessary for growth and survival.
Concurrent inhibition of the AKT and MEK
pathways in a murine lung adenocarcinoma model driven
by mutant Kras is associated with significant tumor
regressions [2]. The precise mechanisms responsible for
mutant KRAS cell death in response to inhibiting AKT
and MEK signaling remain unclear; however, several
studies indicate that these pathways converge in the
regulation of MYC expression [34]. In this way, MYC
has been shown to be of importance for the survival of

cells with activated KRAS [35]. The present studies do
not exclude the possibility that MUC1-C can contribute
to the regulation of MYC in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells
and therefore further studies will be needed to address
this possibility. From a mechanistic standpoint, NSCLC
cells with activated KRAS can vary in their dependency
on KRAS [7, 36]. Engagement of the AKT and MEK
pathways, and sensitivity to their respective inhibitors, are
not a function of KRAS dependency [7]. Rather, extent
of KRAS dependency appears to reside in downstream
regulation of EMT [7]. Notably in this regard, recent
studies have shown that MUC1-C induces EMT in
breast cancer cells by the upregulation of ZEB1 and the
coordinate suppression of miR-200c [17]. In the present
studies, silencing MUC1-C in NSCLC cells decreased
ZEB1, which in turn was associated with increases in miR200c, and significantly, reversal of the EMT phenotype.
The demonstration that targeting MUC1-C with the
MUC1-C(AQA) mutant or GO-203 resulted in similar
responses, providing support for the notion that MUC1-C
is necessary for driving ZEB1 and thereby EMT in these
NSCLC cells. AKT has been shown to contribute to the
induction of ZEB1 expression [27, 28]. In concert with the
involvement of AKT, we also found that inhibition of AKT
suppressed ZEB1 expression. These findings thus support
a model in which targeting MUC1-C downregulates
AKT and thereby ZEB1 expression by an AKT-mediated
mechanism (Fig. 7E).
The coordinate upregulation of ZEB1 and
suppression of miR-200c, an inducer of epithelial
differentiation, is associated with the induction of
EMT [26]. Accordingly, we found that targeting MUC1-C
with the downregulation of ZEB1 and induction of
miR-200c resulted in MET, indicating that MUC1-C
is necessary for conferring the EMT phenotype in these
KRAS-independent NSCLC cells (Fig. 7E). Notably, EMT
dictates the dependency of NSCLC cells on activated
KRAS [7]. By extension, silencing MUC1-C with
reversal of EMT was associated with an increase in the
KRAS dependency index. Similar enhancement of KRAS
dependency was observed when targeting MUC1-C with
the MUC1-C(AQA) mutant and GO-203, indicating that
MUC1-C dictates EMT and KRAS dependency (Fig. 7E).
EMT has been linked to cancer stem-like cells that have
been characterized by the endowment of mesenchymal
traits necessary for invasion and metastases [37]. In this
way, EMT promotes the capacity to form spheres in
non-adherent serum-free culture, a characteristic that is
dependent on the presence of self-renewing stem-like cells
[29, 30]. Therefore, the finding that MUC1-C confers the
EMT phenotype in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells invoked
the possibility that this observation could extend to selfrenewal (Fig. 7E). Indeed, we found that targeting MUC1-C
with silencing or expression of the MUC1-C(CQC→AQA)
mutant decreased sphere forming efficiency. Disruption of

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

established spheres with the GO-203 inhibitor further
demonstrated that these KRAS mutant stem-like cells
are dependent on MUC1-C for their self-renewal. The
involvement of MUC1-C in the capacity for self-renewal
is further supported by the demonstration that silencing
MUC1-C substantially decreases tumorigenicity of KRAS
mutant NSCLC cells growing in nude mice. The available
evidence indicates that cancer stem-like cells maintain
low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that
disruption of ROS defense mechanisms results in loss of
self-renewal [38–41]. In this context, MUC1-C protects
cells from increases in ROS associated with exposure to
oxidative stress, hypoxia and glucose deprivation [32].
These observations and the sensitivity of cancer stem-like
cells to disruption of redox balance lend credence to the
possibility that MUC1-C is necessary for maintenance of
ROS levels and thereby self-renewal.
Finally, the present work has focused on MUC1-C
function in mutant KRAS-independent NSCLC cells
that express ZEB1 and exhibit the EMT phenotype.
Further studies will be needed to assess the role of
MUC1-C in mutant KRAS-dependent NSCLC cells that
are ZEB1 negative and exhibit epithelial characteristics.
Nonetheless, the present findings indicate that targeting
MUC1-C could be an effective therapeutic approach for
at least certain mutant KRAS NSCLCs. In this respect,
GO-203 has completed Phase I evaluation in patients
with refractory solid tumors and a maximum tolerated
dose has been identified for Phase II trials. Given the
challenges being encountered in the treatment of mutant
KRAS NSCLCs, our results lend support to the notion that
targeting MUC1-C with GO-203 could be an alternative
approach for these patients.

METHODS
Cell culture
Human A549/KRAS(G12S), H460/KRAS(Q61H),
H358/KRAS(G12C) and H441/KRAS(G12V) NSCLC
cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI1640 media
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (HI-FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml
penicillin and 2 mM L-glutamine. Authenticity of the
cells was confirmed by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA
profiling (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Molecular
Biology Core). Cells were infected with lentiviral vectors
expressing a MUC1 shRNA (Sigma), a scrambled control
shRNA (CshRNA; Sigma) or a KRAS shRNA (Sigma).
Cells were also transfected to stably express a control
pHR-CMV vector expressing MUC1-C or one expressing
MUC1-C(CQC→AQA). Cells were treated with the
MUC1-C inhibitor peptide GO-203, a control peptide
CP-2 [24] or with the AKT inhibitor GSK690693 (Selleck
Chemicals).
