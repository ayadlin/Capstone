ABSTRACT
We explored the potential of Smac mimetics, which antagonize Inhibitor of
Apoptosis (IAP) proteins, for chemosensitization of neuroblastoma (NB). Here, we
report that Smac mimetics, e.g. BV6, prime NB cells for chemotherapeutics including
the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin (DOX) and vinca alkaloids such as
Vincristine (VCR), Vinblastine (VBL) and Vinorelbine (VNR). Additionally, BV6 acts in
concert with DOX or VCR to suppress long-term clonogenic growth. While BV6 causes
rapid downregulation of cellular IAP (cIAP)1 protein and nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-κB) activation, DOX/BV6- or VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis occurs independently
of NF-κB or TNFα signaling, since overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα
superrepressor or the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)α-blocking antibody Enbrel fail to
block cell death. Mechanistic studies reveal that Receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1
is required for DOX/BV6-, but not for VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis, since transient
or stable knockdown of RIP1 or the pharmacological RIP1 inhibitor necrostatin-1
significantly reduce apoptosis. By comparison, VCR/BV6-mediated apoptosis critically
depends on the mitochondrial pathway. VCR/BV6 cotreatment causes phosphorylation
of BCL-2 during mitotic arrest, enhanced activation of BAX and BAK and loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Additionally, overexpression of BCL-2
profoundly suppresses VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis. Thus, BV6 sensitizes NB cells to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via distinct initial signaling mechanisms depending
on the chemotherapeutic drug. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into
Smac mimetic-mediated chemosensitization of NB.

INTRODUCTION

the extrinsic (i.e. death receptor) pathway and the intrinsic
(i.e. mitochondrial) pathway [2]. The extrinsic pathway
is activated by binding of ligands to death receptors of
the TNF receptor superfamily on the cell’s surface, for
example Tumor-Necrosis-Factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) to TRAIL receptors or TNFα
to TNF receptors [4]. The intrinsic pathway relies on the
release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c
and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases
(Smac) into the cytosol where cytochrome c mediates
caspase activation while Smac antagonize IAP proteins
[5].
Cell death pathways are tightly regulated by proand antiapoptotic proteins. The BCL-2 family of proteins

NB is a common solid tumor in childhood and
patients with advanced or relapsed disease still harbor a
poor prognosis [1]. Hence, there is a high medical need
to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The efficacy of
chemotherapy, one of the key pillars of current treatment
protocols for NB, relies on functional cell death programs
in tumor cells [2]. Therefore, strategies that embark on
activation of programmed cell death may open new
perspectives to enhance the chemosensitivity of cancer
cells [3].
There are two principal pathways of apoptosis that
involve activation of caspases as effector molecules, i.e.

plays an important role in the control of mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization and comprises
antiapoptotic members such as BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL1 and proapoptotic members such as BAX and BAK [5].
Within the IAP family of proteins, x-linked IAP (XIAP),
cIAP1 and cIAP2 are key regulators of programmed cell
death [6]. While XIAP inhibits caspase activation by
binding to caspase-3, -7 and -9, cIAP proteins are involved
in the regulation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB
signaling, e.g. by their ability to promote ubiquitylation
of RIP1 [6].
The targeting of IAP proteins has gained substantial
attention over the last years, as elevated expression of IAP
proteins is commonly found in many cancer types [6].
Small-molecule IAP antagonists that mimick the IAPbinding motif of Smac, i.e. Smac mimetics, have been
developed and shown to elicit cell death in various cancers
either alone or in combination therapies [6].
We previously reported that inhibition of IAP
proteins sensitizes NB cells for TRAIL- or γ-irradiation-

induced apoptosis [7, 8]. Recent evidence suggests that
IAP inhibition by Smac mimetic may also provide a mean
to increase chemosensitivity of NB cells; however, the
underlying mechanisms have so far remained elusive
[9]. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate
the ability of Smac mimetics to sensitize NB cells to
chemotherapy and to identify the underlying molecular
mechanisms of action.

RESULTS
Smac mimetics synergize with DOX and vinca
alkaloids to induce apoptosis in NB cells
To investigate chemosensitization of NB cells by
Smac mimetics, we tested the bivalent Smac mimetic BV6
in combination with subtoxic doses of vinca alkaloids or
the topoisomerase II inhibitor DOX, which are commonly

used in clinical protocols for the treatment of NB. We used
the NB cell line SH-EP, which was previously shown to
represent a suitable in vitro model of NB and to express
key apoptosis regulators such as caspase-8 [10, 11].
Importantly, we found that BV6 cooperated with several
vinca alkaloids, including VCR, VBL and VNR, as well as
with DOX to significantly increase DNA fragmentation,
which was used as a characteristic parameter to determine
apoptosis (Figure 1A). Calculation of combination index
(CI) revealed that BV6 acted in a synergistic manner
together with DOX or VCR to induce apoptosis (suppl.
Tab. 1). We confirmed the cooperative drug interactions
by employing crystal violet assay as another method to
determine cytotoxicity. BV6 acted in concert with DOX
or VCR to significantly reduce cell viability compared
to treatment with DOX or VCR alone (Figure 1B). Also,
we extended our study to additional NB cell lines and
to another Smac mimetic. Similarly, BV6 significantly
enhanced VCR-mediated apoptosis in other NB cell lines
(suppl. Figure 1A), and a pharmacologically distinct Smac
mimetic (i.e. IAP inh. 3) significantly increased VCR- and
DOX-induced apoptosis (suppl. Figure 1B). Furthermore,
we asked whether the combination treatment affects
long-term clonogenic survival of NB cells. Indeed, BV6
cooperated with DOX or VCR to significantly suppress
colony formation compared to treatment with either agent
alone (Figure 1C, suppl. Figure 1C). In contrast to NB
cells, BV6 did not enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX or
VCR against non-malignant peripheral blood lymphocytes
(PBLs), pointing to some tumor selectivity (suppl.
Figure 1D). To explore whether BV6 also sensitizes
chemoresistant cancer cells, we used a rhabdomyosarcoma
model of VCR resistance. VCR-resistant cells were
refractory to BV6/VCR cotreatment (suppl. Figure 1E),
indicating that the combination does not bypass VCR
resistance.
Together, these experiments show that Smac
mimetics cooperate with subtoxic doses of DOX or vinca
alkaloids to induce apoptosis and to suppress long-term
clonogenic survival of NB cells.

prior to the increase in apoptosis (Figure 2B), suggesting
that activation of the caspase cascade contributes to
apoptosis. To determine whether caspase activation is
indeed required for apoptosis, we tested the effects of the
pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. Importantly, addition
of zVAD.fmk significantly reduced DOX/BV6- or VCR/
BV6-induced caspase activation and apoptosis (Figure
2C, suppl. Figure 1F). These findings show that BV6
cooperates with chemotherapeutics to trigger caspase
activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis.

NF-κB and TNFα signaling are dispensable for
DOX/BV6-or VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis
Smac mimetics such as BV6 have been shown
to trigger NF-κB activation and autocrine/paracrine
TNFα signaling upon depletion of cIAP proteins [12].
We confirmed that treatment with BV6 resulted in rapid
downregulation of cIAP1 protein (suppl. Figure 2A).
In order to determine the role of NF-κB in DOX/BV6or VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis, we overexpressed
dominant-negative IκBα-SR to abolish NF-κB
signaling (Figure 3A). We previously demonstrated that
overexpression of IκBα-SR blocks activation of both
canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways upon
treatment with BV6 [13]. Control experiments confirmed
that IκBα-SR overexpression inhibited TNFα-stimulated
phosphorylation of IκBα, used as a marker for NF-κB
activation (Figure 3A), and significantly enhanced TNFαinduced apoptosis and loss of cell viability (suppl. Figure
2B, 2C). However, inhibition of NF-κB by IκBα-SR
failed to protect cells from DOX/BV6-or VCR/BV6induced apoptosis (Figure 3B). To test the involvement
of an autocrine/paracrine TNFα loop, we used the TNFαblocking antibody Enbrel. Enbrel failed to rescue cells
from caspase activation and apoptosis upon treatment
with BV6 together with DOX or VCR (Figure 3C, suppl.
Figure 1F). As positive control, we used MDA-MB-231
breast carcinoma cells, as we previously reported that they
undergo apoptosis upon treatment with BV6 in a TNFαdependent manner [13]. Addition of Enbrel profoundly
blocked TNFα-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells
(suppl. Figure 2D). This set of data demonstrates that NFκB and TNFα signaling are dispensable for DOX/BV6-or
VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis.

BV6 cooperates with chemotherapeutics to
trigger caspase activation and caspase-dependent
apoptosis
To better understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the cooperative induction of apoptosis that we
identified for BV6 together with chemotherapeutics, we
monitored activation of caspases by Western blotting. BV6
acted in concert with DOX or VCR to trigger cleavage of
caspase-8 and caspase-3 into active fragments (Figure 2A).
Cleavage of caspase-9 into active p37/p35 fragments was
in particular observed upon cotreatment with VCR/BV6
(Figure 2A). Kinetic analysis of apoptosis revealed that
this proteolytic activation of the caspase cascade occurred

RIP1 is required for DOX/BV6-induced apoptosis,
but dispensable for VCR/BV6-mediated apoptosis
Since we previously reported that RIP1 is required
for Smac mimetic-mediated sensitization for TRAILinduced apoptosis of NB cells [7], we asked whether RIP1
is also involved in chemosensitization by BV6. To address
this question, we used both genetic and pharmacological
approaches. Genetically, RIP1 was transiently knocked

siRNA oligonucleotides and knockdown efficacy was
controlled by Western blotting (Figure 4A). Interestingly,
we found that silencing of RIP1 significantly reduced

were independently confirmed by stable knockdown of

VCR/BV6 cotreatment engages the mitochondrial
pathway

play an important role in the control of mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization, we hypothesized that
the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is preferentially
engaged during VCR/BV6-mediated apoptosis. To test
this hypothesis, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of
BCL-2 by Western blotting, as the phosphorylated BCL-2
migrates slower than the unphosphorylated form and can
be detected as a separate band on SDS-PAGE. Indeed,

BCL-2 has been described to become inactivated
via phosphorylation during mitotic arrest caused for
example by treatment with microtubule-interfering drugs
such as VCR [14]. Since proteins of the BCL-2 family

treatment with VCR alone and in combination with
BV6 resulted in the appearance of an additional higher
band of BCL-2 (Figure 5A), consistent with increased
phosphorylation of BCL-2. Addition of λ-phosphatase
blocked this bandshift in BCL-2, underscoring that it is
caused by phosphorylation (suppl. Figure 4). In parallel,
we detected increased phosphorylation of histone H3, a
specific marker of mitosis [15] in VCR-treated and VCR/
BV6-cotreated cells (Figure 5A). These findings indicate
that VCR promotes inactivation of BCL-2 via increased
phosphorylation during mitotic arrest.
To investigate whether BCL-2 inactivation
by phosphorylation leads to activation of the
proapoptotic multidomain proteins BAX and BAK,
we analyzed the activation status of BAX and BAK by
immunoprecipitation. Upon activation, BAX and BAK
undergo a conformational change that can be detected by
active conformation-specific antibodies. Interestingly, we
found increased levels of the activated forms of BAX and
BAK in particular upon VCR/BV6 cotreatment (Figure
5B). To test whether activation of BAX and BAK leads
to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, we
analyzed MMP. VCR and BV6 cooperated to trigger
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential compared to
treatment with VCR alone (Figure 5C).

BCL-2 overexpression rescues in particular VCR/
BV6-induced apoptosis
To further explore the functional relevance of
BCL-2 and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, we
overexpressed BCL-2. Ectopic expression of BCL-2 was
confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 6A). Of note, BCL2 overexpression almost completely suppressed VCR/
BV6-mediated apoptosis and decreased the amount of cells
with active caspase-3/7, while it partially decreased DOX/
BV6-induced apoptosis and caspase-3/7 activation (Figure
6B, 6C). This indicates that the mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis is particularly important for mediating VCR/
BV6-induced apoptosis.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of
Smac mimetics to sensitize NB cells to chemotherapy as
well as the underlying molecular mechanisms of action.
Here, we report that Smac mimetics prime NB cells
for apoptosis upon treatment with chemotherapeutic
drugs including the topoisomerase II inhibitor DOX and
microtubule-interfering drugs such as VCR, VBL and
VNR. BV6 acts together with DOX or VCR not only to
reduce cell viability and to induce DNA fragmentation,
but also to suppress long-term clonogenic survival,
demonstrating the efficacy of these combinations.

death. This conclusion is supported by both genetic and
pharmacological inhibition of RIP1 showing that stable
or transient knockdown of RIP1 by RNAi as well as
pharmacological inhibition of RIP1 by Nec-1 significantly
rescue DOX/BV6-, but not VCR/BV6-induced apoptosis.
By comparison, engagement of the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis is a critical event in particular during VCR/
BV6-mediated apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment with
VCR or VCR/BV6 causes phosphorylation and thus
inactivation of BCL-2 during VCR-imposed mitotic arrest,
leading to activation of the proapoptotic multidomain
proteins BAX and BAK and loss of MMP. Also, caspase-9,
the initiator caspase in the mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis, was predominately activated by VCR/BV6
cotreatment. The crucial role of mitochondrial signaling
is underlined by rescue experiments showing that
overexpression of BCL-2 almost completely blocks VCR/
BV6-induced apoptosis, whereas BCL-2 overexpression
partially decreases DOX/BV6-induced apoptosis.
Subsequent to these distinct initial signaling events, both
DOX/BV6 and VCR/BV6 combination treatments share
a common effector phase of apoptosis, which relies on
activation of caspases and caspase-dependent cell death,
as the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk markedly
reduces DOX/BV6- as well as VCR/BV6-induced
apoptosis. Since Smac mimetics such as BV6 antagonize
XIAP in addition to cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins, the Smac
mimetic-induced release of XIAP-mediated inhibition of
caspase-9, -7 and -3 results in enforced caspase activation.
While the Smac mimetic LBW242 has been
described in the past to enhance the efficacy of
chemotherapy against NB in vitro and in vivo [9], the
underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Thus, the
novelty of our current study resides in the demonstration
that BV6-mediated chemosensitization of NB cells
is mediated via distinct initial signaling events in a
chemotherapeutic drug-dependent manner. We identify
a crucial role of RIP1 for DOX/BV6-induced apoptosis,
whereas apoptosis upon VCR/BV6 cotreatment critically
depends on the engagement of the mitochondrial pathway
of apoptosis.
RIP1 has previously been reported to constitute
a central signaling hub for Smac mimetic-mediated
sensitization of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. In acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we identified RIP1 as a
critical regulator of the synergism of Smac mimetics and
Cytarabine, which mediates the formation of a RIP1/
caspase-8/FADD complex via an autocrine/paracrine loop
of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and is necessary for
activation of caspase-8 and -3, mitochondrial perturbations
and apoptosis [16]. In addition, we demonstrated that BV6
primes glioblastoma cells in a RIP1-dependent manner
for Temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapeutic
agent in the treatment of glioblastoma, since knockdown
of RIP1 significantly reduced BV6- and TMZ-induced
caspase-8 activation and apoptosis [17]. Besides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination studies with chemotherapeutic drugs, RIP1
has been shown to be required for Smac mimetic-based
sensitization to other cytotoxic stimuli. For example, RIP1
was reported to be required for apoptosis induced by Smac
mimetics together with agonistic monoclonal antibodies
against TRAIL receptors in NB [7], glioblastoma [18]
and rhabdomyosarcoma cells [19] as well as for the
synergistic interaction of Smac mimetics together with
glucocorticoids in ALL [20].
While an autocrine/paracrine TNFα loop has been
demonstrated to mediate cell death in response to Smac
mimetics alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs in a variety of cancers [12, 16, 21-24], in our present
study TNFα turned out to be dispensable for both DOX/
BV6- and VCR/BV6-mediated apoptosis. Similarly,
sensitization for chemotherapy by Smac mimetics has
been described to occur in a TNFα-independent fashion [9,
17, 25]. This points to both TNFα-dependent and TNFαindependent signaling pathways during Smac mimetic/
chemotherapy-triggered cell death.
In contrast to these studies showing the requirement
of RIP1 for Smac mimetic-mediated sensitization to
various cytotoxic stimuli, RIP1 was also demonstrated
to be dispensable for Smac mimetic-based combination
therapies [25, 26]. Interestingly, Greer et al. reported that
silencing of caspase-9, but not RIP1 rescued non-small
cell lung cancers cells from cell death upon combined
treatment with the Smac mimetic JP1201 and the vinca
alkaloid VNR [25]. As caspase-9 represents the initiator
caspase of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, these data
support our conclusion that the mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis plays a critical role in mediating cell death in
combination treatment with Smac mimetic together with
VCR as one of the vinca alkaloids. However, the impact
of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway likely depends
on the context including the cytotoxic stimulus, since
we previously reported that XIAP inhibition combined
with the death receptor ligand TRAIL can bypass BCL2-imposed resistance of pancreatic carcinoma cells by
switching type II cells, which depend on the mitochondrial
contribution as an amplification step to the death receptor
pathway, into type I cells in which TRAIL-induced
caspase activation and apoptosis proceeds irrespectively
of high BCL-2 levels [27].
The present study has important implications, as it
emphasizes the potential of combination regimens with
Smac mimetics and commonly used anticancer drugs to
increase chemosensitivity of NB. Smac mimetic-based
combination therapies might also reduce the risk of toxic
side effects, as lower concentrations of chemotherapeutics
might be sufficient in combination regimens due to the
cooperative effects. This might be particularly relevant
for drugs such as DOX and VCR for which drug toxicity
such as cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity can cause serious
concerns [28, 29]. Since DOX and vinca alkaloids form
part of standard chemotherapy in NB [1] and since Smac

penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10
mM HEPES (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). LAN-5
cells were grown in flasks coated with rat tail I collagen
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Doxorubicin,
VCR, VBL and VNR were purchased from Sigma
(Deisenhofen, Germany); zVAD.fmk from Bachem
(Heidelberg, Germany), Enbrel from Pfizer (Berlin,
Germany), Nec-1 from Biomol (Biomol GmbH, Hamburg,
Germany) and TNFα from Biochrom (Biochrom GmbH,
Berlin, Germany). The bivalent Smac mimetic BV6 was
kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco,
CA, USA), chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless
otherwise indicated.

Determination of apoptosis, cell viability, colony
formation and caspase-3/7 activity

Western blot analysis

Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric
analysis (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide
(PI)-stained nuclei as described previously [31]. Cell
viability was assessed by crystal violet assay using crystal
violet solution (0.5% crystal violet, 30% ethanol, 3%
formaldehyde). Plates were then rinsed with water and
crystal violet incorporated by the cells was re-solubilized
in a solution containing 1% SDS. Absorbance at 550 nm
was measured using a microplate reader (Infinite M100,
Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). Results are expressed as
percentage of untreated controls. For colony formation
assay, 100 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates after
treatment with either 5 µM BV6 for 11 hours and/or 0.05
µg/ml DOX for 1 hour or 5 µM BV6 and/or 5 nM VCR
for 11 hours. Cells were cultured in drug-free medium
for additional 13 days before fixation and staining with
0.5% crystal violet, 30% ethanol and 3% formaldehyde.
Colonies were counted macroscopically. Caspase-3/7
activity was detected by Cell Event Caspase-3/7
Green Detection Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and
ImageXpress Micro XLS system (Molecular Devices,
Biberach an der Riss, Germany).

Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [31], using the following antibodies: cIAP1,
α-Tubulin, pH3, RIP1, BCL-2 (BD, New Jersey, USA),
p-IκBα, IIκBα, caspase-3, caspase-9 (Cell Signaling,
Beverly, MA), caspase-8 (Enzo Life Science, Lörrach,
Germany), GAPDH (HyTest, Turku, Finland), BCL-2 (Life
Technologies, Inc.). Goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit
IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as
secondary antibodies for enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) and Donkey
anti-mouse IgG, donkey anti-rabbit IgG or donkey antigoat IgG labeled with IRDye infrared dyes were used for
fluorescence detection (Odyssey Imaging System, LI-COR
Bioscience, Bad Homburg, Germany). Representative
blots of at least two independent experiments are shown.

Determination of BAX/BAK activation and MMP
BAX and BAK activation was determined by
immunoprecipitation of active conformation by specific
41532

Oncotarget

antibodies as previously described [32]. Briefly, cells
were lysed in CHAPS buffer (1% CHAPS, 150 mM
NaCl, 10 
mM HEPES pH 7.4). 1 mg protein was
incubated overnight at 4°C with 2 g mouse monoclonal
anti-BAX antibody (clone 6A7; Sigma) or 0.5 µg mouse
monoclonal anti-BAK antibody (AB-1, clone TC-100;
Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 µl pan-mouse IgG
Dynabeads (Dako, Hamburg, Germany), washed with
CHAPS buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using
rabbit polyclonal anti-BAX NT (Merck) antibody or rabbit
polyclonal anti-BAK antibody (BD Biosciences). MMP
was analyzed by flow cytometry using JC-1 dye (Life
Technologies, Inc.).

Statistical significance, when comparing two groups,
was assessed by Student’s t-Test (two-tailed distribution,
two-samples with equal variance) using Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft Deutschland GmbH, Unterschleißheim,
Germany); *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. Drug
interactions were analyzed by the CI method based on that
described by Chou [33] using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK). CI < 0.9 indicates synergism, 0.9 - 1.1
additivity and > 1.1 antagonism.
