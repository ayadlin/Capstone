ABSTRACT
The p53 protein ensures cellular fidelity by suppressing or killing cells under
stresses that enhance the mutation rate. Evidence suggests that the p53 protein may
also ensure the fidelity of the epigenome. In this study a group of drugs that alter the
deoxycytosine methylation patterns in cellular DNA are shown to preferentially kill
human and mouse cells that contain p53 mutations or deficiencies. These observations
are extended to mice that contain p53 deficiencies or missense mutations in their
genome, which are preferentially killed when compared to mice with a wild type p53
gene. This is also the case for human cancer cell xenografts containing p53 mutations,
which preferentially are killed by these drugs when compared to similar tumors with
wild type p53. The loss of p53 function enhances a synthetic lethality with drugs that
block or alter the patterns of deoxycytidine methylation in the genome.

demonstrated that it was possible to reprogram fibroblasts
into induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS cells) by
employing four transcription factors, myc, Klf4, Sox-2
and Oct-4. This process is inefficient (about 0.1% of the
cells form IPS cells) and takes a long time in culture. In
the absence of p53 however only Sox-2 and Oct -4 will
produce IPS cells at much higher efficiencies (up to 80%)
and much shorter times [3–8]. This suggests that wild
type p53 slows the rate of epigenetic reprograming [9]
in both normal cells and cancer cells. Indeed the wild
type p53 protein is inactive in embryonal carcinoma
cells (EC cells), the stem cell of testicular cancers [10]
and IPS cells will differentiate when wild type p53 is
activated or introduced [9]. In human breast cancer cells
[11] there is a strong correlation between the loss of p53
functions and the presence of an embryonic stem cell
mRNA profile or signature as observed by microarrays.
In many cancer cells the loss of p53 function permits the
transcription of repetitive DNA elements via epigenetic
changes in the repetitive DNA sequences and chromatin
[12, 13]. In Planaria, the p53 protein regulates both
proliferation and stem cell renewal for regeneration [14]
and in the salamander, p53 controls cell plasticity in limb

INTRODUCTION
The p53 protein is a transcription factor that
responds to a wide variety of stresses. These stresses
include DNA damage, metabolic alterations in a cell,
hypoxia, the interruption of ribosomal biogenesis,
oncogene activation and even viral infections. There are
several types of p53- mediated responses to these stress
signals, which include DNA repair, metabolic changes,
cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence and apoptosis that
may mediate tumor suppression. Because these types
of stress occurring during cell division can enhance the
mutation rates in cells, p53 enforces the fidelity of the
division cycle lowering the rate of tumorigenesis.
Recently several lines of evidence have suggested
that the p53 protein may also prevent epigenetic
changes from occurring during division or development.
Experiments by Jackson-Grusby et al [1] demonstrated
that the loss of the DNA-methyl-transferase-1 gene from
cells in culture, resulted in the failure to copy methylcytosine residues in the DNA and after two cell divisions
the cells died of a p53-mediated apoptosis. Employing a
quite different approach, Yamanaka and colleagues [2]

regeneration [15]. Indeed the earliest phenotype of p53
function was cellular self-renewal or immortalization,
which was highly correlated with p53 mutation in cell
culture[16]. Taken together these observations suggest
that p53 functions monitor or regulate stem cell states and
epigenetic changes that produce stem cells or progenitor
cells.
DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic
markers for gene repression. Many reports have
demonstrated a strong association between disruption
of DNA methylation and the formation of neoplasia
[17]. In cancer cells promoter hypermethylation of
CpG islands occurs frequently to silence many tumor
suppressor genes. On the other hand, the total DNA
is generally hypomethylated in tumors commonly
due to the undermethylation of repetitive elements in
heterochromatic regions of the genome [17]. A number
of chemical DNA methylation inhibitors have been
developed and have been classified into nucleoside
analogues and non-nucleoside analogues. The
nucleoside analogues are incorporated into the DNA
or RNA by replication or transcription. For example
cytosine analogues 5-aza-cytotidine (Vidaza) and 5-aza2-deoxycytidine (Decitibine) were shown to reactivate
many aberrantly repressed genes in tumors inducing
anti-proliferative activity. The non-nucleotide cytosine
methylation inhibitors act by inhibiting the DNA
methyl-transferases at their catalytic site [18].
In 2004, Nieto et al [19] first reported that 5-aza2-deoxycytidine selectively killed p53 deficient mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) but failed to kill MEFs that
contained wild type p53 protein. Mutations in other p53
related pathway proteins such as p19-ARF, P16 INK4a,
p21, E2F-1 or E2F 2 all failed, unlike p53 mutants, to
permit killing of the cells by this drug. These results
were followed up by Leonova et al [13] who provided a
mechanism for this observation. She and her colleagues
demonstrated that in the absence of wild type p53
epigenetic changes in the genome lead to the expression of
repetitive DNA sequences and the resultant RNAs (some
of which form extensive secondary structures) induced
interferon production resulting in cell death (i.e. activation
of the innate immune response).
In this publication we confirmed and extended these
observations. In addition to 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, we
found a number of DNA methylation inhibitors could
induce greater levels of apoptosis in p53 deficient MEFs
than in wild type cells both in cell culture and in vivo.
These results were extended to live mouse models and to
human xenograft cancer models. These data contribute
additional evidence that the p53 protein plays a critical role
in epigenetic regulation that has important consequences
for cancer treatments.

P53 deficient or mutant mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEF) were hypersensitive to two
types of DNA methylation inhibitors
Two previous publications reported that the DNA
demethylation agent Decitabine unexpectedly induced
more apoptosis in p53 null or mutated cells than in
p53 wildtype cells [13, 19]. These results posed the
hypothesis that partial inhibition of DNA methylation
may cause lethality for p53 deficient cells but not for
wildtype cells. To examine this hypothesis and explore
more potential drugs, we applied guava cell viability
assays to 5 different DNA demethylation reagents, FCDR,
Decitabine, Zebularine, EGCG, RG108. Three of them
were nucleoside analogues. They were Decitabine, FCDR
and Zebularine (Fig1Aa-c). Two were non-nucleoside
analogue inhibitors, EGCG and RG108 (Fig1Ad,e). Their
molecular structures are shown in Figure 1A. In our assay,
four genotypes of MEFs were used including wildtype,
p53 knock-out, p53 gain of function mutation r172h and
r270h. p53r172h mutation is a structural mutation in the
protein DNA binding domain, which led to a protein
conformation change and loss of DNA binding capability
of p53 [20]. The p53r270h mutation is a contact function
mutation that occurs in the DNA binding domain which
also affected p53 protein binding to DNA [18]. Both
mutations commonly accumulate to high levels in tumor
cells and are defective in wild-type p53 functions. To
ensure that each cell line had a comparable high starting
proliferation rate and avoid the possible artificial effect
caused by long time cell culture, all the MEF cells used in
this assay were at low passages (P0-P2). Serial dilution of
drugs was given to each cell culture from day 0 to day 5,
and the guava assays were accomplished at day 5.
As shown in figure 1B, after 5 drug treatments, all
p53 deficient cells (p53KO, r172h or r270h) displayed
very similar growth inhibition curves, clearly separating
themselves from those for wild type cells. All three
nucleoside analogue inhibitors were capable of killing
p53KO/mut MEFs specifically. Among them, FCDR
showed the highest efficiency in killing, while Zebularine
showed the lowest efficiency. Non-nucleoside analogue
inhibitor, EGCG, showed toxicity to both wild type and
p53 deficient cells at higher dose, however, in the range
from 10μM to 60μM, the wild type cells still showed
more resistance to apoptosis than p53 deficient cells.
Another non-nucleoside analogue inhibitor, RG108, on the
contrary, showed very low toxicity to both wild type and
p53 mutated cells, however, when the drug concentration
was increased to above 100uM, it started to induce more
cell death but only in p53 mutant cells.

FCDR and Decitabine treatment did not
immediately stop wild type cells from
proliferation

The p-values from log-rank test (p=0.0077(p53KO) and
0.0014(p53r270h)) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests
(p =0.0090 (p53KO) and 0.0011(pp53r270h)) were both
statistically significant when comparing p53 KO/mutant
mice to wild type control mice. Conversely, no significant
difference was found when comparing p53KO to p53r270h
mice. The rapid time of death after this treatment implied
of possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity of the drug. We
therefore applied Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain
on control and drug treated intestinal tissues for three
genotypes. However, our histopathological microscopy
did not detect any significant changes on the intestinal
tissues including mucosa, integrity of the epithelium, and
the cell apoptosis (data not shown), suggesting that the
mice could have died from other organ failures.

Due to the existence of the wild type P53 protein in
wild type MEFs, one can hypothesize that drug treatment
could activate wild type p53 functions which might turn on
the cell cycle arrest genes and stop cell from replication,
therefore preventing them from cell death. To investigate
this possibility, an assay over five days was carried out to
follow the cell proliferation rate in primary MEF cells,
treated with increasing levels of FCDR and Decitabine.
As shown in Fig 2Aa & Ba, all wild type MEFs displayed
similarly increasing growth curves from day1 to day 5.
This proliferation did not change with increased doses
of FCDR (Fig 2Aa) or Decitabine (Fig 2Ba). In contrast,
p53 knock out MEFs showed clearly slower growth
curves with increasing dosage of FCDR (Fig 2Ab) and
Decitabine (Fig 2Bb). The proliferation rate significantly
dropped with time. In addition, the slowest growth rates
were strongly associated with the higher drug dosage.
Similar results were also seen in p53 missense mutated
r172h cells (Fig 2Ac & Bc). All these results suggested
that the low dosage of demethylation drugs did not
immediately trigger the p53 mediated cell cycle arrest
in wild type cells. Previously published results [13] had
demonstrated that the Decitabine treatment of wild type
and p53KO MEFs caused the same degree of depletion
in free DNMT1 protein activity and similar declines of
genomic DNA methylation [13], which suggested that
the drug inhibited an equal level of DNA demethylation
in both wild type and p53KO cells. The result reported
here support these previous observations [13] by showing
the nucleoside analogue inhibitors such as FCDR and
Decitabine are incorporated into the DNA of p53 mutant
and wild type cells in equal levels. In addition p53 mutant
and wild type cells replicate at equal rates during treatment
with these drugs, yet p53 mutant cells eventually die while
wild type cells can live.

P53 deficient human lung cancer cells were more
sensitive to DNA methylation inhibitors than
p53 wild type normal or cancer cells
In mouse cells, we confirmed the results from
previous publications that p53 deficient cells were more
susceptible to DNA demethylation treatment than wild
type cells, and found 4 more compounds functioning
through the same pathway with a similar effect on p53
deficient cells. However all of these experiments were
carried out with mouse cells and in mice. It remained
unclear how human cells, especially cancer cells,
would respond to these demethylation drugs. We
therefore performed the guava viability-count assay
for selected human lung cancer cell lines employing
5 different demethylation drug treatments. Four cell
lines were included in this assay. WI38 was normal
human embryonic lung fibroblast cells with wild type
p53 function. A549 was human non-small cell lung
carcinoma cells with wild type p53 expression. H1299
was human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells with
no p53 expression (a deletion mutation). H1975 was
human lung adenocarcinoma cells with homozygous
missence mutated p53r273h gene. p53r273h is the
human counterpart of mouse p53r270h mutation. Among
the 5 drugs, FCDR, Decitabine and EGCG displayed
preferential killing of the p53 null(H1299) or mutated
cells (H1975) faster than p53 wild type cells and the
p53 mutant cells died at lower dosages (Fig 4A, B, D).
However, Zebularine and RG108, which had
discriminated between p53 mutant and wild type cells
in their treatment, did not show this type of specificity in
the human lung cells culture (Fig 4C,E). when comparing
to all the human cell lines employed, the p53 wild type
normal fibroblast WI38 displayed the strongest resistance
to all demethylation drug treatments. This result again
confirmed that, in general, demethylation drug treatment
preferentially kills p53 deficient cells in human cell
culture. However, the actual efficiency of each drug may
vary, depending on tissue or species specificity.

P53 deficient mice had shorter mean life
span than control mice after lethal dosage
of Decitabine injection
To study the impact of dymethylation drugs in mice
we performed a toxicity assay with p53 deficient and
wild type mice using a Decitabine injection. We injected
lethal doses of Decitabine into mice with three different
genotypes, i.e., p53 knock out, p53r270h mutation and
p53 wild type. 37.5mg/kg of Decitabine was injected
four times (IP) every other day into each mouse at the
age of 8–12 weeks. We recorded the number of days of
survival for each mouse. The day after the last injection
was recorded as Day 1 for producing the survival curves.
As shown in figure 3, on average, both p53 knock-out and
p53r270h mice died earlier than wild type control mice.

To determine the mechanism of cell death by these
drugs, the activated caspase protein expression level
was determined after each drug treatment. As shown in
Figure 4F, FCDR Decitabine and EGCG treatment did not
significantly increase cleaved Caspase 9 & 3 protein levels
in p53 wild type normal WI38 cells. Similar results were
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also seen in p53 wild type cancer cells, A549 after FCDR
and EGCG treatment. Unlike WI38, in A549, there is some
background expression of cleaved caspase 9 even in the
untreated control cell cultures. However, the Decitabine
treatment increased the expression of cleaved caspase
9 & 3 in the A549 cells. This result is consistent with

EGCG injection into nude mice significantly
inhibited growth of p53 null lung Xenograft
tumors but not the p53 wild type lung tumors

previously observation that, Decitabine treatment caused a
greater cell death in A549 cells than in the WI38 cells. On
the contrary, in both p53 null and mutated cells, FCDR,
Decitabine and EGCG treatment induced a significantly
high expression of cleaved caspase 9 & 3. This result
suggested that the caspase mediated apoptosis pathway did
contribute to the demethylation drugs selectively killing
in the p53 deficient cells. The capase protein expression
level was strongly coordinated with the growth inhibition
observed in the human cell cultures even though mouse
cell cultures.

Based on the cell culture result, we knew that the
p53 null cancer cell H1299 was more susceptible to
EGCG treatment than the p53 wild type cancer cell A549.
We then investigated whether this observation would
be observed in a xenograft tumor model. We injected
the human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 into
immunocompromised nude mice to form tumor. One week

later, when the tumor volume reached 50 mm3, 50 mg/kg
of EGCG was given to these nude mice (tumor carrier) by
IP injection employing a 2 day interval for up to 40 days
(21 times). The tumor volume was measured on the day
of each injection. We noticed that the tumor growth rates
were slightly different for each cell line. For the first 20
days, the A549 control tumors (no drug used) grew faster
than H1299 control tumors in nude mice. After 20 days,
the H1299 control tumors grew faster. To minimize the
variability in the nature growth rates of different tumor
types, we only compared the results between test groups

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(treated with the drug) and control groups (not treated with
the drug) within the same tumor type. Consistent with the
results in cell culture described earlier, EGCG had no
significant impact on suppressing the A549 tumor growth
(Fig5A, C), but significantly delayed the H1299 tumor
growth. In the first 12 days, almost all of the 12 EGCG
treated H1299 tumors were reduced in size (Fig 5B, C).
After 12 days, 5 out of 12 tumors had stopped growing
before completely vanishing (p-value<0.001). The other
7 tumors gradually grew back in size after stopping the
drug treatment but were still smaller on average than the

and reducing cell death so that corrections can be made
to restore proper epigenetic control. The work reported in
this publication confirms and extends these observations
from mouse to human cells, employing several different
types of drugs that block methylation of cytosine residues,
and from cell culture to mice carrying p53 deficient alleles
and cancerous xenografts growing in mice. However the
results reported here are not without some difficulties
in the interpretation of these data. The set of drugs that
block methylation of cytosine residues in DNA show
some species specificities in their preferences for killing
p53 deficient cells (human or mouse) and possibly even
tissue or cell type differences. This may indicate off target
effects of these drugs or differences in p53 functionality.
Indeed the set of drugs tested here were not uniform in
distinguishing mutant p53 (killed) from wild type p53
cells (survive better). The differences between these drugs
will need to be explored.
The relationships between the stability of
epigenetic regulation in cells and the role of p53 in
that regulation, as reviewed in the introduction section
of this paper, is becoming better established. Related
to this is the function of p53 in normal and cancerous
stem cells. Essential to understanding how wild type p53
senses epigenetic changes is the need for a mechanism
that mediates the p53 response when epigenetic
changes occur. One obvious mechanism comes from
the observation that the p53 protein is modified by
phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination,
sumolation and N-acetylglycosylation . Further many of
these modifications result in changes in the activity and
specificity of the transcriptional programs regulated by
p53. Indeed some of the very same enzymatic activities
that modify chromatin modify the transcription factors
like p53 to coordinate the preparation of the DNA
templates and the regulators of the templates. In breast
and prostate cancers of humans p53 mutation gives rise to
a different transcriptional program, more like embryonic
stem cells [11, 21] than is observed with p53 wild type
cancers.
The experiments of S. Lowe and his colleagues
[22] have demonstrated that a wild type p53-mediated
program of cellular senescence includes the transcription
of genes involved in cytokine secretion and the attraction
of phagocytic cells and NK cells that eliminate the
senescent cells from the body. What is quite interesting
is that the loss of p53 functions via mutation of the p53
gene results in epigenetic reprograming, the expression
of repetitive satellite non-coding RNAs that also result
in the production of cytokines and interferon [13]. This
is a clever failsafe when a p53 mutation arises in a cell
that should then result in interferon-mediated death
of de novo cancer cells. Unfortunately the resultant
genomic instability of cells with p53 mutations finds a
path to interferon resistance and cell replication. It is of
some interest that the latest immunotherapies employing

DISCUSSION
Changes in DNA methylation patterns are
well known to be associated with genome wide
hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation in
numerous cancers [17]. These changes have been
linked to both increased and decreased alterations in
the transcription of both genes and non-coding RNAs
considered critical to carcinogenesis. In mammals the
enzymes that catalyze the transfer of methyl-groups onto
cytosine residues are composed of three family members;
Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Dnmt1 methylates a
cytosine residue in a CpG dinucleotide when the opposite
strand base pairs GpC are methylated on the cytosine
residue. It is the copy DNA methyl-transferase once the
epigenetic marks are in place. Dnmt3a and 3b are de novo
cytosine methyl-transferases, which lay down the initial
patterns of DNA methylation.
In 2004 the Serrano group [19] first reported that
the treatment of mouse embryo fibroblasts with 5-aza2deoxycytodine, which incorporates into the DNA and
blocks further DNA methylation, led to apoptosis of these
cells when they were deficient in p53 but not when they
had wild type p53. They demonstrated that drug treatment
of these cells, with or without p53, led to the same levels
of hypomethylation of these cells but that cells with
wild type p53 activated the p53 protein for transcription
and these cells arrested at the G2/M checkpoint where
as p53 deficient cells accumulated severe chromosomal
alterations and then undergo apoptosis. Thus p53
senses the levels of DNA methylation changes and after
activation employs cell cycle arrest to reduce cell death.
These studies were followed up by Leonova and
her colleagues [13] who found that p53 deficient cells
treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytodine, but not p53 wild
type cells, induced a large increase in short-interspersed
nuclear elements (SINE RNAs) and transcription of both
strands of near –centromeric satellite DNAs consisting of
tandem repeats and multiple species of noncoding RNAs.
These are the analogous RNA species described by Haber
and his colleagues in human cancers but not expressed
in normal cells [12]. The absence of p53 in these cells
presumably permits the epigenetic changes to occur that
result in the transcription of the repetitive RNA species.
Leonova went on to show that the RNA repeats induce
a strong endogenous apoptosis-inducing type-1 interferon
response, which kills these cells. This phenomenon
was called TRAIN (transcription of repeats activates
interferon).
The Serrano and Leonova results both point to a role
for wild type p53 in sensing changes in epigenetic control

antibodies to CTLA-4 and the PD-1 ligand now permit
the T-cells to function and kill the cancer cells [23]. If
the p53 gene is mutant and one employs low levels of
5-aza 2-deoxycytodine this will stimulate the interferon
and cytokine responses and should attract T-cells and
phagocytes. So it is of some interest that treatment of
cancers with low levels of 5-azacytidine enhances the
anti-PD-1 ligand activity after the epigenetic changes
[24, 25]. Based upon this one might anticipate that both
a wild type transcriptional program and a mutant p53’s
failure to regulate epigenetic states in the cell, could both
lead to enhanced immunotherapy when the right drugs are
also employed.
It is becoming clear that the loss of the p53 protein
function in cells creates a synthetic lethality and one path
to exploiting this may well involve the drugs that block
epigenetic fidelity. We will need to understand this path in
greater detail to maximize the use of these drugs.

p53+/+ (n = 20), and p53-/- (n = 22). Mice were treated

by using the formula: volume =1/2 LxW2. Tumors were
allowed to grow to 50mm3 prior to two-day interval of
intraperitoneal administration of EGCG (Sigma) at 50mg/
kg or vehicle control (1xPBS) for up to 40 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions
The primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
wt, p53-/-, p53R172H/ R172H, p53R270H/R270H was
derived from C57BL/6 mice by our own lab with standard
protocols. All MEF cells are cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS.
H1299, H1975, WI38, A549 was purchased from ATCC.
A549, H1299 and WI38 were cultured in DMEM with
10% FBS. H1975 was cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS.

Cell Proliferation Assay

REFERENCES

Cell proliferation assay was done with Cell counting
kit-SK in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
(Dojindo Molecular Technology, Inc.). In brief, 3,000 cells
per well were cultured in 96-well plate to reach the 20%–
30% confluence on the second day when treated with
serial dilutions of the compounds. The growth is measured
by CCK-SK reagent and Victor Plate reader instrument
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) after incubation for
5 days.
