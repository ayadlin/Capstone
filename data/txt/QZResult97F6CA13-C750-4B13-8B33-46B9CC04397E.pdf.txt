Abstract
CYP3A enzymes metabolize endogenous hormones and chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer, thereby potentially
affecting drug effectiveness. Here, we reﬁned the genetic basis
underlying the functional effects of a CYP3A haplotype on urinary
estrone glucuronide (E1G) levels and tested for an association
between CYP3A genotype and outcome in patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast, or lung cancers. The most
signiﬁcantly associated SNP was rs45446698, an SNP that tags the
CYP3A7 1C allele; this SNP was associated with a 54% decrease in
urinary E1G levels. Genotyping this SNP in 1,008 breast cancer,
1,128 lung cancer, and 347 CLL patients, we found that
rs45446698 was associated with breast cancer mortality (HR,
1.74; P ¼ 0.03), all-cause mortality in lung cancer patients (HR,

1.43; P ¼ 0.009), and CLL progression (HR, 1.62; P ¼ 0.03). We
also found borderline evidence of a statistical interaction between
the CYP3A7 1C allele, treatment of patients with a cytotoxic agent
that is a CYP3A substrate, and clinical outcome (Pinteraction ¼ 0.06).
The CYP3A7 1C allele, which results in adult expression of the fetal
CYP3A7 gene, is likely to be the functional allele inﬂuencing levels
of circulating endogenous sex hormones and outcome in these
various malignancies. Further studies conﬁrming these associations
and determining the mechanism by which CYP3A7 1C inﬂuences
outcome are required. One possibility is that standard chemotherapy regimens that include CYP3A substrates may not be optimal for
the approximately 8% of cancer patients who are CYP3A7 1C
carriers. Cancer Res; 76(6); 1485–93. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

substrates (1). Speciﬁcally, in addition to a role in the oxidative
metabolism of endogenous hormones, CYP3A enzymes metabolize around 50% of all clinically used drugs including many of
the agents used in treating cancer (2). Of particular relevance to
breast cancer, the hormonal agent tamoxifen, the alkylating agent
cyclophosphamide, the taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, and the
topoisomerase II inhibitor, mitoxantrone are all CYP3A substrates
(1, 3). CYP3A genes are differentially regulated and substantial
interindividual differences in expression have been reported for
all three genes (4). CYP3A4, the major isoform in adults, is
predominantly expressed in the liver, where it is the most abundant P450, accounting for 30% of total CYP450 protein (5).
CYP3A5 is "polymorphically" expressed, with approximately
33% of Europeans and 60% of African Americans expressing
detectable levels in the adult liver (4). CYP3A7, the major isoform
in the fetus, is generally silenced shortly after birth (6).
We have previously screened 642 SNPs tagging 42 genes
involved in sex steroid synthesis or metabolism, and tested for
association with premenopausal urinary estrone glucuronide
(E1G) levels, measured in serial urine samples collected at prespeciﬁed days of the woman's menstrual cycle (7). We demonstrated that a rare haplotype, deﬁned by two SNPs spanning
the CYP3A gene cluster (rs10273424 and rs680055), was associated with a highly signiﬁcant 32% difference in urinary E1G
(7). Predicated on the assumption that genetically determined
effects on metabolism may impact on patient outcome, we
have (i) reﬁned the genetic basis for this association and (ii)
examined the association between genotype and outcome in
three cancers—breast and lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL).

The CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A4 genes, which form the
cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A (CYP3A) gene cluster at
7q22.1, encode enzymes that metabolize a diverse range of

Patients and Methods
Ethics
The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and all patients provided written
informed consent. Ethical approval for the study was obtained
from the Royal Marsden NHS Trust.
Study subjects—ﬁne mapping of the CYP3A locus
Full details of the 371 women from the British Breast Cancer
(BBC; ref. 8) and the 358 women from the Mammography
Oestrogens and Growth Factors (MOG; ref. 9) studies genotyped
for this analysis have been published previously (7). Brieﬂy, they
comprised premenopausal women who were ﬁrst-degree relatives
and friends of breast cancer cases (BBC study) or participants in
the intervention arm of a trial of annual mammographic screening
in young women (10) conducted in Britain (MOG study). To be
eligible, women had to be having regular menstrual cycles, not
using hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives and
not to have been diagnosed with breast cancer at recruitment to
the study. All women had self-reported Northern European
ancestry. To be included in the original analysis and this ﬁnemapping analysis women had to have provided serial urine
samples, at pre-speciﬁed days of their menstrual cycle for measurement of creatinine-adjusted urinary E1G. E1G was measured
using an in-house ELISA (7).
Study subjects—risk analysis
Royal Marsden Hospital Lifestyle and Family History study. The
Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) Lifestyle and Family History
study comprises 1,786 consecutive breast cancer patients who
attended the RMH Breast Unit (RMH, Chelsea, London, UK)
between June 2000 and January 2007. Women were invited to
participate in the study by completing a questionnaire, consenting
to access to medical records and providing a blood sample. We
identiﬁed all women with self-reported White ethnicity for whom
DNA was available (n ¼ 1,536). We excluded: women born

outside the British Isles (n ¼ 173, 11.3%), women not followed
up at the RMH (n ¼ 96, 6.3%), secondary referrals where the
pathology report from the referring hospital was missing or
incomplete (n ¼ 97, 6.3%), cases presenting with metastatic
disease (n ¼ 13, 0.8%), complex disease histories (n ¼ 8), atypical
histology (n ¼ 6), women who had a prophylactic mastectomy
(n ¼ 2), and cases unable to be traced (n ¼ 13). Finally, we
excluded 118 (7.7%) cases with noninvasive cancer leaving 1,010
cases for analysis. Two hundred and twenty-one patients died
during follow-up; for 159 (71.9%) cause of death was recorded as
breast cancer.
GELCAPS lung cancer cases. Patients with lung cancer were ascertained through the Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study
(GELCAPS), a population-based study of lung cancer. Full details
of the design and conduct of the study have been described
previously (11). The current analysis is based on 1,142 patients
from whom detailed clinicopathologic data and follow-up information had been collected using a standardized proforma. All
cases were of self-reported White ethnicity and were United
Kingdom residents.
The UK Leukemia Research Fund CLL4 trial. We studied CLL
patients entered in the UK Leukemia Research Fund CLL4 trial.
Comprehensive details about the design and conduct of the trial
have been published elsewhere (12). Brieﬂy, CLL4 was a randomized phase III trial established to compare the efﬁcacy of ﬂudarabine, chlorambucil, and the combination of ﬂudarabine plus
cyclophosphamide as a ﬁrst-line treatment for Binet stages B, C,
and A-progressive CLL. Age was not a criterion for entry into the
study. Of the 777 patients entered into the trial, the current analysis
is based on a random subset of 356 patients of White Caucasian
ethnicity who had blood samples taken for clinical diagnostic
purposes and cell marker studies at participating centers.
SNP selection, imputation, and genotyping. To ﬁne map the 7q22.1
association signal for urinary E1G levels (7), we used SNAP (13)

CYP3A7 Variation and Cancer Outcome

to identify 184 SNPs that were correlated (r2  0.1) with
rs10273424 and rs680055, based on the CEU 1000 genomes
(1KG) pilot data. We were able to design Sequenom plexes
(Sequenom Inc.) for 154 of these; we also included 7 SNPs
genotyped as part of the original study (7) for monitoring
of quality control. Post genotyping, we excluded 19 SNPs that
failed genotyping and 4 SNPs for which the call rate was <95%,
leaving 138 SNPs for analysis. The mean call rate for these 138
SNPs was 99.4% and genotypes of all SNPS were in accordance
with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (i.e., P > 0.05). On the basis of
the 25 (3.4%) duplicate samples, concordance was 100% across
the 138 SNPs.
To increase the density of our ﬁne mapping, we imputed
untyped genotypes using IMPUTE version 2.2 software, with 1KG
as the reference. Thresholding at an INFO score of 0.8, 725
additional SNPs and indels were successfully imputed, resulting
in a total of 863 variants for analysis in 727 samples.
To conﬁrm imputed genotypes for the most signiﬁcant SNP
(rs45446698) and to test for association with patient outcome we
genotyped rs45446698 by TaqMan (Life Technologies). Call rates
were 96.9% (ﬁne-mapping and RMH Lifestyle and Family History
study), 98.8% (GELCAPS), and 97.5% (CLL4). Concordance with
imputed genotypes (ﬁne-mapping) and between duplicate samples (cancer cases) was 100%.
Sequencing. We conﬁrmed that rs45446698 was serving as a proxy
for the CYP3A7 1C allele by Sanger sequencing a 370 bp PCR
fragment, including the 60 bp region that deﬁnes this allele in four
common homozygotes, three heterozygotes, and one rare homozygote (primer sequences available on request).
Statistical analysis
Fine-mapping. The percentage of change in hormone level per
allele of each SNP was estimated by linear regression models of
loge-transformed hormone levels. We used t tests of the regression
coefﬁcient to calculate P values for linear trend.
Risk analysis. We used Cox regression to test for an association
between rs45446698 genotype and breast cancer speciﬁc survival
(BCSS; RMH Lifestyle and Family History study) or progressionfree survival (PFS; CLL4). For lung cancer (GELCAPS), where the
prognosis is poor (5-year survival <10%), we used overall survival
as a proxy for a disease-speciﬁc outcome. In the breast cancer
series, to allow for differences in ascertainment between incident
and prevalent cases, the time at risk began on the date of diagnosis,
but the time under observation began on the date of entry to the
study (deﬁned as receipt of blood sample; refs. 14, 15). Time at
risk ended on the date of death from breast cancer, or censoring
(deﬁned as date of last follow up or death from other causes). All
cases were censored at 15 years after diagnosis on the basis that
follow-up was likely to be unreliable after this period. For GELCAPS cases, time at risk began on the date of diagnosis and ended
on the date of death from any cause, last follow-up or censoring.
For the CLL4 cases, time at risk began at randomization to the trial
and ended on date of progression, date of last follow-up or
censoring. Because rs45446698 has a minor allele frequency of
0.04, we combined rare homozygotes with heterozygotes and
used a one degree of freedom (1df) test. To test for statistical
interaction between genotype and each stratifying variable, we
compared models with and without interaction terms using

www.aacrjournals.org

likelihood ratio tests. The proportional hazards assumption was
tested using Schoenfeld residuals. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 2.11 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and STATA software, version 11.0. All reported
P values are two-sided.

Results
The most signiﬁcantly associated SNP was rs45446698, which
was associated with a 54% reduction in urinary E1G [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 61.0% to 47.7%; P ¼ 6.9  1024; Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table S1]. rs45446698 is one of seven highly
correlated SNPs (rs11568824, rs45494802, rs45575938,
rs45467892, rs11568825, rs11568826, and rs45446698) that
cluster within the CYP3A7 promoter and comprise the CYP3A7 1C
allele (4). Sequencing of the CYP3A7 promoter in four carriers of
the rare rs45446698-C allele and four rs45446698-A common
homozygotes conﬁrmed that rs45446698 tags all seven base

changes that deﬁne the CYP3A7 1C allele in these Northern
European women (data not shown).
To assess rs45446698 as a potential marker of disease outcome,
we genotyped 1,008 breast cancer patients participating in the
RMH Lifestyle and Family History study (Materials and
Methods; Table 1). For the majority of patient and tumor characteristics, there was no association with rs45446698 genotype.
The exception was the number of positive lymph nodes;
rs45446698-C carriers were more likely to have four or more
positive nodes than rs45446698-A homozygotes (Table 1; P ¼
0.003). In an unadjusted analysis, carrier status for rs45446698-C
was associated with a 74% increase in breast cancer mortality (HR,
1.74; 95% CI, 1.08–2.82; P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 2A). Restricting the
analysis to the 889 individuals for whom we had complete data,
and adjusting for established prognostic factors (age, tumor size,
grade, positive nodes, and vascular invasion) and radiotherapy
did not alter this result (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05–2.90; P ¼ 0.03).
Stratifying on estrogen receptor (ER) status showed no evidence
that the association differed by ER status (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.03–
3.34; P ¼ 0.04 and HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.55–5.24; P ¼ 0.35 for ERpositive and ER-negative disease respectively; Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.92).
In this cohort of breast cancer patients, median time from
diagnosis to enrolment was 1.7 years, but the range was wide
(0–12.3); excluding the 65 (7.3%) cases diagnosed more than 5
years before enrolment did not alter the HR estimate (HR, 1.82;
95% CI, 1.09–3.04; P ¼ 0.02) and stratifying on time from
diagnosis to enrolment, we found no evidence that the HR was
biased by the inclusion of prevalent cases (HR, 1.72; 95% CI,
0.72–4.08; HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.06–3.89, for cases diagnosed <1

A

or 1 year before entry to the study, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.76). There
was, however, some evidence that the risk associated with
rs45446698-C carrier status varied with time since diagnosis (test
of the assumption of proportional hazards, P ¼ 0.01); stratifying
the analysis into two time periods, the HRs were HR, 1.14 (95%
CI, 0.53–2.47; P ¼ 0.74) and HR, 4.46 (95% CI, 1.98–10.04; P ¼
0.0003) for the ﬁrst (t < 7.5 year since diagnosis) and second (t 
7.5 years since diagnosis) halves of the study, respectively.
To determine whether rs45446698 was associated with outcome for other site-speciﬁc cancers, we genotyped the GELCAPS
lung cancer cases (Table 2; ref. 11) and the CLL4 trial series
(Table 3; ref. 12). There was no evidence that rs45446698 was
associated with patient or disease characteristics. In GELCAPS,
rs45446698-C carrier status was associated with a 26% increase in
all causes mortality (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96–1.64; P ¼ 0.09; Fig.
2B). After adjusting for standard prognostic factors (age, gender,
stage, and smoking status), surgery, and radiotherapy the HR was
1.43 (95% CI, 1.09–1.87; P ¼ 0.009) with no evidence that the
association differed between small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and
non–small cell lung cancer (NCLSC; HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.18–3.16;
P ¼ 0.009 and HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.90–1.74; P ¼ 0.19 for SCLC
and NSCLC respectively, Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.16). In this cohort of
lung cancer cases, there was no evidence that the association
varied with time since diagnosis (test of non-proportional hazards
P ¼ 0.93). In the CLL series, carrying the variant allele of
rs45446698-C was associated with a 54% increased risk of progression (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.00–2.36; P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 2C).
Adjusting for standard prognostic factors (age, gender, and stage)
altered this result only marginally (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.05–2.50;

mutation status were available (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.89–2.39; P
¼ 0.13), adjusting for 13q deletion (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.89–2.38;
P ¼ 0.13) or mutation status (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.83–2.22; P ¼
0.23) altered the result only marginally. In this cohort of CLL
cases, there was no evidence that the association between genotype and disease-free progression varied with time since diagnosis
(test of non-proportional hazards P ¼ 0.78).
To determine whether the association between rs45446698
genotype and outcome was inﬂuenced by chemotherapy, speciﬁcally treatment with an agent that is a CYP3A substrate
(Table 4), we carried out stratiﬁed analyses and tested for
statistical interaction. Stratifying on treatment with tamoxifen,
in the breast cancer series, there was no evidence that the
association differed between strata; HRs were 1.68 (95% CI,
0.90–3.13; P ¼ 0.10) and 1.89 (95% CI, 0.69–5.17; P ¼ 0.21)
for treated and non-treated, respectively (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.89).
Stratifying on treatment with a cytotoxic agent that is metabolized by a CYP3A enzyme (Table 4), the association between
genotype and outcome appeared to be speciﬁc to patients who
were treated with a CYP3A substrate (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.11–
3.45; P ¼ 0.02) compared with those who were not (HR, 0.98;
95% CI, 0.28–3.49; P ¼ 0.98), but this difference was not
statistically signiﬁcant (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.57). Similarly, in
the lung cancer study, the HR in cases who were treated
with a CYP3A substrate was more extreme (HR, 1.71; 95% CI,
1.21–2.41; P ¼ 0.003) than in those who were not (HR, 1.11;

www.aacrjournals.org

95% CI, 0.71–1.74; P ¼ 0.64), but with no evidence of statistical interaction (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.24). In the CLL trial, the
only chemotherapeutic agent that was a CYP3A substrate was
cyclophosphamide (Table 4). Comparing cases who were or
were not treated with cyclophosphamide, respective HRs for
rs45446698-C carriers were HR, 2.15 (95% CI, 0.82–5.64;
P ¼ 0.12) and HR, 1.36 (95% CI, 0.83–2.22; P ¼ 0.22;
Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.52). Combining data across all three studies,
the HR for rs45446698-C carriers who were treated with a
cytotoxic agent that is a CYP3A substrate was 1.80 (95% CI,
1.36–2.39; P ¼ 4.1  105) compared with an HR of 1.20
(95% CI, 0.87–1.65; P ¼ 0.26; Fig. 3) for those who were not,
with borderline evidence of statistical interaction between
treated and non-treated (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.06), but no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.79
and 0.87 for non-treated and treated, respectively).

Discussion
Our data support the CYP3A7 1C allele, tagged by rs45446698
as being the likely genetic basis for the association between the
rs10273424-A rs680055-G haplotype and urinary E1G levels (7).
This allele has previously been associated with signiﬁcantly
reduced serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and
estrone (E1) levels in men, providing independent support for
our ﬁndings (16).
The CYP3A7 1C allele arose from a gene conversion event in
which an approximately 60 bp region within the fetal CYP3A7
promoter was replaced with the equivalent region from the
adult CYP3A4 gene (17). Comparing the variant CYP3A7 1C
allele with the reference CYP3A7 allele, there are seven, highly
correlated, single base changes, all of which map to the CYP3A7
promoter and which result in expression of CYP3A7 in adult
carriers of the CYP3A7 1C allele. Functional analyses demonstrated that two of these SNPs (rs11568825 and rs11568826)
are necessary and sufﬁcient for determining pregnane-X-receptor (PXR)–dependent activation of CYP3A7 and four of the

other ﬁve SNPs (rs11568824, rs45494802, rs45575938, and
rs45467892) inﬂuence constitutively activated receptor (CAR)–
mediated activation (18).
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to test for an association
between the CYP3A7 1C allele and outcome in cancer patients.
Genome-wide association studies of breast and lung cancer survival have been published (19–30); although none has reported
an association with variants at the CYP3A locus only one, a recent
meta-analysis from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium
(BCAC), that combined data from nine breast cancer studies, has
had power to detect moderate effects for variants with MAF <0.05
at genome-wide signiﬁcance. The lack of association between
rs45446698 and outcome in the BCAC meta-analysis (30) may
reﬂect a relatively short mean duration of follow-up with censoring of cases at 10 years after diagnosis. In our breast cancer data, we
found evidence of non-proportional hazards such that the association between the CYP3A7 1C allele and outcome varied with
time since diagnosis with HRs of 1.14 and 4.46 at <7.5 and 7.5
years after diagnosis, respectively. Replication of this ﬁnding in
additional studies will be needed to determine whether this time
dependence is a chance ﬁnding, whether any such effect is speciﬁc
to breast cancer, and whether it is inﬂuenced by the doses and
combinations of chemotherapeutic agents that the patients
received.
Because of the wide diversity of exogenous and endogenous
substrates that are metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes, there
are many different potential mechanisms by which CYP3A
expression could inﬂuence disease outcome and we cannot at
this juncture conﬁrm or refute any particular mechanism.
Possibilities include the CYP3A7 1C allele (i) associating with
markers of disease prognosis (e.g., stage, grade, or lymph node
involvement) dependent on, or independent of, endogenous
hormone levels or (ii) by inﬂuencing plasma clearance of
chemotherapeutic agents that are CYP3A substrates. In support
of a CYP3A allele–inﬂuencing outcome through association
with prognostic markers, association of the CYP3A4 1B allele
with higher tumor-lymph node-metastasis and Gleason score

has been reported for prostate cancer (31); and in a study of
Ewing's sarcomas, high expression of CYP3A4 was signiﬁcantly
associated with distant metastases (32). In this analysis, we
observed an association between the CYP3A7 1C allele and
lymph node metastasis (4 positive nodes) in breast cancer
cases. There was, however, no association between carrier status
and disease stage for lung cancer or CLL and the association of
CYP3A7 1C with adverse outcome for all three cancers
remained after adjusting for established prognostic markers.
In support of the CYP3A7 1C allele–inﬂuencing plasma
clearance of chemotherapeutic agents, this allele was associated
with adverse outcome across three site-speciﬁc cancers and,
although these cancers have differing etiologies and prognoses,
the treatment regimens for all three include CYP3A substrates
(Table 4). Consistent with an extensive body of evidence
demonstrating that the efﬁcacy of tamoxifen therapy cannot
be predicted by CYP2D6 genotype (33, 34), we found no
evidence of statistical interaction between the CYP3A7 1C
allele, outcome and treatment with tamoxifen. For cytotoxic
cancer drugs, there was consistency across the three studies; HRs
in CYP3A7 1C carriers were more extreme in patients treated
with a drug that was a CYP3A substrate, and in the combined
data there was some evidence of statistical interaction between
the CYP3A7 1C allele, treatment with a cytotoxic agent that was
a CYP3A substrate and outcome (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.06). Further
studies conﬁrming the association of the CYP3A7 1C allele
with adverse outcome and investigating the mechanism by
which this allele may inﬂuence outcome are required.
There are several limitations to this analysis; the endpoints
that we analyzed varied across the three different malignancies
(disease-speciﬁc mortality, breast cancer), all-cause mortality
(lung cancer), and disease progression (CLL). Although genotypes are effectively randomized at birth (35) and there was
no association between being a carrier of the CYP3A7 1C allele
and receiving chemotherapy (Table 1, P ¼ 0.23 and Table 2, P ¼
0.47 for breast and lung cancers respectively), treatment was
not randomized in the two observational studies. The

frequency of CYP3A7 1C allele is just 4% (8% carriers); accordingly, we were unable to analyze cases who were heterozygous
or homozygous for the variant allele separately. The relative
rarity of this allele and the lack of detailed information on drug
doses and numbers of treatment cycles limited our ability to
carry out meaningful subgroup analyses. We could not investigate whether the time dependence of the association between
the CYP3A7 1C allele and outcome that we observed in the
breast cancer study depended on particular combinations of
cancer drugs and we were unable to test for statistically significant interaction between outcome, the CYP3A7 1C allele and
individual chemotherapeutic agents or speciﬁc treatment regimens. The pooled estimate of the increased risk in carriers of
the CYP3A7 1C allele, treated with one or more cytotoxic
agents that are CYP3A substrates (HR, 1.80; P ¼ 4.1  105)
represents a "weighted average," which may vary substantially
between different treatment regimens and across cancer types.
Finally, even in the combined data from all three of these
retrospective studies, the evidence for statistical interaction
between outcome, the CYP3A7 1C allele and the cytotoxic

www.aacrjournals.org

agents that are CYP3A substrates was weak (P ¼ 0.06).
Although this may reﬂect the heterogeneity of treatment regimens and a lack of power, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the association between CYP3A7 1C and disease outcome
is mediated by some other mechanism.
In conclusion, we have shown that the CYP3A7 1C allele,
which results in the adult expression of the fetal CYP3A7 gene,
is likely to be the functional allele that is associated with both
lower levels of circulating endogenous sex hormones and adverse
outcome in breast cancer, lung cancer, and CLL. Our results
require independent replication in larger studies, preferably with
more detailed information on chemotherapy schedules and
dosages, and across other cancer sites. However, one implication
of our ﬁndings is that the doses and regimens of chemotherapeutic agents that provide optimal beneﬁt for the average patient
may not be optimal for the approximately 8% of cancer patients
who are CYP3A7 1C carriers.
