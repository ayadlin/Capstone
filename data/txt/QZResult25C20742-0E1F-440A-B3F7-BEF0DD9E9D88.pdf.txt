BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was an exploratory endpoint in the PALETTE trial, a global, double-blind,
randomized, phase 3 trial of pazopanib 800 mg versus placebo as second-line or later treatment for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (N 5 369). In that trial, progression-free survival was significantly improved in the pazopanib arm (median, 4.6 vs 1.6
months; hazard ratio, 0.31; P <.001), and toxicity of pazopanib consisted mainly of fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, and hypertension. METHODS: HRQoL was assessed using the 30-item core European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12 in patients who received treatment
on protocol. The primary HRQoL endpoint was the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status scale. RESULTS: Compliance with HRQoL
assessments was good, ranging from 94% at baseline to 81% at week 12. Differences in scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health
status subscale between the 2 treatment arms were not statistically significant and did not exceed the predetermined, minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (P 5.291; maximum difference, 3.8 points). Among the other subscales, the pazopanib arm
reported significantly worse symptom scores for diarrhea (P <.001) loss of appetite (P <.001), nausea/vomiting (P <.001), and fatigue
(P 5.012). In general, HRQoL scores tended to decline over time in both arms. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL did not improve with the
receipt of pazopanib. However, the observed improvement in progression-free survival without impairment of HRQoL was considered
a meaningful result. The toxicity profile of pazopanib was reflected in the patients’ self-reported symptoms but did not translate into

INTRODUCTION
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a rare and heterogeneous collection of mesenchymal cancers. Patients with advanced STS
have a poor prognosis, with median overall survival (OS) of approximately 12 months from diagnosis of metastatic disease.1 Therefore, treatment strategies should aim at more active treatments while also limiting treatment-related morbidity, controlling or alleviating symptoms, and retaining the performance of normal daily activities in as far as possible.

Original Article

Patients with advanced STS often report difficulties with
fatigue, pain, or respiratory symptoms, which can reduce
their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or restrict
their independence.2,3 These difficulties are caused not
only by the disease itself but also by the treatment.
Because of the success of imatinib in producing a
dramatic improvement in disease control by targeting
KIT and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors,4 there has been a major
focus on identifying sarcoma subtypes with the appropriate targets for novel molecular-targeted agents. This has
caused further fragmentation of treatment strategies in
this already limited patient population.5 STS growth is
characterized by accelerated angiogenesis6; therefore, inhibiting this process could form an effective treatment
strategy. Pazopanib (Votrient; GlaxoSmithKline Oncology, Uxbridge, UK) is a selective, multitargeted receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3,
PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, and KIT. The PALETTE study,
a global, double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial that
compared the efficacy of pazopanib versus placebo for
the treatment of metastatic STS, investigated the
HRQoL of patients in addition to progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. It is the only published phase 3
study to date of patients after failure on standard therapy
for advanced STS.7
That study demonstrated that PFS was significantly
prolonged with pazopanib (median, 18 weeks) compared
with placebo (median, 6 weeks; hazard ratio, 0.31; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.40; P < .0001).8 The
reported adverse events were representative of those
expected for an angiogenesis inhibitor, with common ontherapy grade 3 and 4 toxicities in the pazopanib arm
including fatigue (13%), hypertension (7%), anorexia
(6%), and diarrhea (5%). Clinically relevant cardiac side
effects were limited and manageable.
An exploratory objective of this study was to compare HRQoL outcomes between the 2 treatment arms
using 2 psychometrically validated instruments that are
widely used in trials of cancer patients: the 30-item core
European Organization for the Research and Treatment
of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire
(EORTC QLQ-C30),9 and the EuroQol 5D instrument
(EQ-5D).10 The current article focuses on reporting
detailed HRQoL results from the EORTC QLQ-C30 in
line with the requirements established by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Patient-Reported
Outcomes extension.11 EQ-5D data were used for costeffectiveness analyses reported elsewhere.12,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The PALETTE study (EORTC 62072, GlaxoSmithKline
VEG110727, and European Clinical Trials Database
[EudraCT] 2008-001307-33) enrolled patients who had
metastatic STS with documented, measurable progressive
disease (during the last 6 months before the start of study
drug or 12 months in patients who had received prior adjuvant treatment). Patients were aged 18 years, had a
World Health Organization (WHO) performance status
0 or 1, and had failed at least 1 anthracycline-containing
regimen. Full details of the eligibility criteria are reported
elsewhere.8 HRQoL assessments were described for
patients in the informed consent form. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committees and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00753688).
Study Design

PALETTE was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, phase 3 trial conducted by the EORTC Soft
Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group across 72 sites worldwide. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority in PFS (defined as the time from randomization to
either the first documentation of Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined disease progression
[according to an independent radiology review] or death
from of any cause) of pazopanib over placebo. Secondary
objectives included comparisons of OS, radiologically
confirmed objective responses, and safety profiles (results
reported previously7). An additional objective was to
compare HRQoL between treatment arms using the
EORTC QLQ-C30 instrument. Patients were randomized to the treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio to receive either
pazopanib 800 mg once daily or placebo using a central,
stratified, permuted block procedure. The stratification
factors were the number of previous lines of systemic
therapy received for advanced disease (0-1 vs 2 lines)
and WHO performance status (0 vs 1). Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
withdrawal of consent, or death. After discontinuation of
study treatment, further treatment was applied at the discretion of the patients and their physicians. The treatment arm allocation remained blinded until the time of
final analysis or at the physician’s request upon disease
progression or medical emergency. No cross-over was
allowed.
Assessments

The EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) is a 30-item questionnaire that assesses HRQoL in cancer patients across 9
Cancer

HRQoL of Pazopanib in Pretreated STS/Coens et al

multi-item scales: global health status (GHS), physical
functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning,
cognitive functioning, social functioning, fatigue, pain,
and nausea and vomiting. It also contains single-item
measures of dyspnea, insomnia, anorexia, constipation,
diarrhea, and financial impact).9 It has been translated
into many languages.14 Patients provide their answers on
a 4-point scale (from 1 [not at all] to 4 [very much]),
except for GHS, which has a 7-point scale (from 1 [very
poor] to 7 [excellent]). A linear transformation is used to
standardize the raw score, so that overall scores range from
0 to 100. For the EORTC QLQ-C30, a higher score on
GHS or on a functioning scale represents a better level of
quality of life and functioning, and a higher score on a
symptom scale represents a worse level of symptoms.15
Patients were asked to finish the questionnaires as completely as possible at the beginning of their hospital visit.
Administration of the HRQoL questionnaires followed the clinical assessment schedule of the trial: the
EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed at baseline (from 2
weeks before randomization to the start of treatment) and
at weeks 4, 8, and 12 after starting treatment for patients
who received protocol-specified treatment, allowing a 1week window before and after the scheduled visit for questionnaire completion. If a patient discontinued protocol
treatment or was unblinded, then HRQoL was no longer
assessed. Guidelines for administering questionnaires
were provided, ensuring standardization of HRQoL data
by all personnel.16
Statistical Methods

The prespecified primary HRQoL outcome was GHS on
the EORTC QLQ-C30 to test the hypothesis that
patients who receive pazopanib would have improved
HRQoL compared with patients in the placebo arm. To
accommodate the repeated nature of the data, a linear
mixed-effects model was constructed with treatment,
time-effect and time-treatment interactions as fixed
effects, and a patient-specific random effect. This model
was applied to the data from all randomized patients, and
the most suitable covariance structure was determined on
the basis of Akaike Information Criterion.17 Score estimates, standard errors, associated CIs, and subsequent
tests were obtained from the resulting model. The primary
test consisted of a general overall postbaseline test for no
differences between the 2 treatment arms at all postbaseline time points using an overall F test statistic at a 5%
level of significance. Because missing data are a problem
in most HRQoL studies, sensitivity analyses were preplanned and performed investigating the informative

dropout by graphic evaluation and assessing the relation
between selected variables (sex and the stratification factors: performance status and number of previous lines)
and questionnaire compliance using logistic regression. In
these analyses, factors that were associated with the missing data process were included as additional covariates in
the mixed model. In addition, a linear regression model
was used to predict the value of these missing data and to
subsequently impute the data.18 The main analysis was
then repeated on this augmented data set. Further sensitivity analyses included limiting patient selection to the
safety or per-protocol population, applying the primary
model to the other scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, and
the use of summary statistics. For GHS, the difference
between the baseline assessment and subsequent assessments was calculated 1) until the last available score, 2)
until the lowest available score, and 3) as the average of all
postbaseline scores. A final summary statistic was the percentage of patients reporting a change from baseline of
10-points at any time on the GHS scale. Differences of
at least 10 points (on a 0-100 scale) were chosen because
these correspond to the minimum clinically meaningful
change in the HRQoL parameter).19
In post-hoc exploratory analyses, factor analysis and
linear regression models were used to explore the correlations between HRQoL scores. Linear regression also was
used to link relative dose intensities (ie, the amount of drug
administered proportional to the protocol drug schedule)
with HRQoL parameters. Prognostic factor analyses of
PFS and OS were performed using Kaplan-Meier techniques and Cox proportional hazards regression. The exploratory tests were stratified for treatment allocation when
possible. All analyses were done using the statistical software package SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients

In total, 369 patients (123 in the placebo arm and 246 in
the pazopanib arm) were randomized in 16 months (October 2008 to February 2010) and represented the intentto-treat population. Baseline demographics and clinical
characteristics were well balanced between the 2 arms (Table 1). Additional data are reported elsewhere.8
HRQoL Completion Rates and Baseline Scores

Completion rates for HRQoL questionnaires in the
intent-to-treat population are listed in Table 2. Compliance with HRQoL assessment was good, and 94% of
patients completed the questionnaires at baseline. Compliance rates slowly decreased over time, with the lowest

rate reported at week 12 (78% and 81% for the placebo
and pazopanib arms, respectively). No statistically significant differences in compliance rates between the 2 arms
were observed at any time point, but patients in the placebo arm tended to complete fewer questionnaires, largely
because of a higher progression rate. The median number
of completed questionnaires was 3 for the pazopanib
group and 2 for the placebo group. The mean and median
HRQoL scores at baseline for the EORTC QLQ-C30
scales were comparable between the 2 treatment arms.
Overall, compared with other studies, the compliance
rates in our trial were within all acceptable limits.20
GHS Modeling

The overall test for postbaseline differences between the
2 treatment arms resulting from the repeated measures
mixed effect with an unstructured covariance was not
significant (P 5 .291). Differences in GHS between the
2 treatment arms assessed at each of the week-4, week-

Missing Data Mechanism

An investigation into the reported reasons for missing
data revealed that the main documented reason was
administrative failure (either the patient or the staff forgetting to complete the assessment), which accounted
for 63% of all reported reasons for missing data. Missingness was not related to selected clinical prognostic
variables.

maximum observed difference occurred at week 4 and
was 23.8 points (95% CI, 29.0, 1.3), indicating a
lower score in the pazopanib arm, but it was not beyond
the 10-point threshold for clinical significance. Figure 1
illustrates the mean GHS scores estimated according to
the model and the corresponding 95% CIs. In both
arms, the mean GHS scores tended to decline over
time.

The mixed-effect model was replicated in the safety population (overall test for difference, P 5 282) and in the perprotocol population (P 5 .315). In addition, although no
variable was significantly linked to compliance, sex and
the stratification factors were added as extra fixed-effects
covariates (P 5 .302). All of these models yielded very
similar results. Explicit regression imputation with
imputed values predicted from a regression model that
included certain variables (time, treatment group, sex,
age, WHO performance score, the number of previous
lines of systemic treatment for advanced disease) also confirmed that there were no significant differences (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information). The
change in GHS scores from baseline between the 2 treatment arms in terms of average or last reported scores were
not clinically significant. However, a difference in terms
of the minimum number and proportion of patients experiencing a 10-point decrease was reported, both in favor
of the placebo arm (Table 4).

Estimates for the differences between treatment arms were calculated using linear mixed modelling and are expressed in absolute score points on the scale.
For the GHS and role functioning scales, positive numbers indicate a higher value (better quality of life) for pazopanib compared with placebo. For the symptom scales (diarrhea, loss of appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue), positive numbers indicate a higher level of symptoms (worse quality of life) for pazopanib compared with placebo.

were statistically but not clinically significant. All differences were in favor of the placebo arm.
Exploratory Post-Hoc Analyses

Figure 1. Mean global health status (GHS) scores and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
using the model. In both treatment arms, the GHS scores
tended to decline over time.

Other Scales

Among the other scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, there
were both statistically and clinically significant differences
in scores between the 2 treatment arms for diarrhea, loss
of appetite, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue (Table 3).
Patients who reported at least 1 minimally important worsening (ie, an increase 10 points) in any of those 4 symptom scales are summarized in Table 4. No significant
differences were observed in scores on any of the functioning scales (physical, emotional, role, social and cognitive
Cancer

September 1, 2015

Exploratory factor analysis revealed that GHS scores were
associated mainly with functioning scales (physical, role,
and social) and less with symptom scales, with the exception of fatigue. Linear regression of the various EORTC
QLQ-C30 scales on the GHS score revealed that current
GHS was linked with role functioning, social functioning,
fatigue, and pain. Future GHS (ie, the GHS score
reported at the next assessment) was linked with role functioning, social functioning, and fatigue only. Pazopanib
dose intensity before week 4 was significantly related to
the fatigue score at week 4 (P 5 .006). However, no correlations with HRQoL parameters were observed at the
week-8 or week-12 time points.
The results of prognostic factor analyses of the
effects of baseline GHS scores and changes in GHS scores
from baseline to the week-4 assessment on PFS and OS
are summarized in Table 5. A statistically significant effect
was observed for the baseline GHS score on OS, in which
patients who had GHS scores 50 had poorer survival
(9.1 months vs 13.7 months; P 5 .0002) (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
HRQoL was an important exploratory endpoint of the
phase 3 PALETTE trial. The results obtained from the
prespecified analysis demonstrated that pazopanib had no
significant impact on GHS. Various sensitivity analyses
(using different populations, methodologies, or outcomes) supported the primary analysis, indicating that
pazopanib can be administered in this patient population

without relevant deterioration in perceived overall health
or HRQoL status. The objective of the current study was
to demonstrate whether GHS could be improved by the
administration of pazopanib, which was not the case.
However, achieving a delay in PFS without an impairment in GHS is considered a meaningful result.
Significantly worse outcomes in the pazopanib arm
were observed for 4 symptoms scales: diarrhea, appetite
loss, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue. These results are in
line with the known toxicity profile of pazopanib and
angiogenesis inhibitors in general. The most frequently
cited side effects of pazopanib treatment in patients with
STS include hypertension, skin reactions, gastrointestinal
disturbances, and fatigue.6,8,22 Similar observations are
reported in other cancers, most notably renal cell carcinoma.23,24 However, a notable point is that, despite their

impact on these 4 symptom scales, the side effects did not
translate into worse GHS or functional scale scores. Only
the role-functioning scale, which measures the ability to
continue daily tasks and work, was borderline worse in the
pazopanib arm. Its maximum observed difference of 9.5
points (95% CI, 17.1-1.9 points), which occurred at week
4, was just short of clinical significance. There also did not
seem to be any strong evidence that HRQoL affected
treatment compliance, with fatigue at the week-4 time
point the only event related to pazopanib dose intensity.
This may be because patients became accustomed to the
pazopanib dosing and side effects early in their treatment
period. However, it should be noted that these results
stem from an exploratory, post-hoc analysis and may not
be reliable.
Currently, there is limited information in the literature on the HRQoL impact of pazopanib administration
in patients with advanced STS. Even general information
on HRQoL in advanced STS after first-line treatment is
scarce: only 6 randomized trials (this study and 5 phase 2
trials) have been published since 1980.7 HRQoL results
are more common in extremity STS in patients with
early/localized disease.25-27 For this population, surgical
options and impairment in physical functioning are obviously the dominant issues, as is the lack of patient input in
decisions regarding treatment.27 Reichardt et al2 recently
reported on HRQoL and health state utilities specifically
among patients with metastatic STS and bone sarcoma
(excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumors) who had
attained a favorable response to chemotherapy, whereas
Shingler et al3 reported on STS health state utilities in
general. Their observations are similar to those obtained
in our current study, with the authors reporting fatigue as
a major driver in reduced overall HRQoL. Both groups
reported a general decline in HRQoL over time, most
likely caused by the underlying disease burden. Moreover,
their results highlighted the significant negative impact of
disease progression, because patients who developed progressive disease consistently reported lower HRQoL.
Beyond STS, there have been other studies examining the impact of pazopanib on HRQoL. Most notably,
Cella et al28 investigated the HRQoL of patients who
were receiving pazopanib for advanced renal cell carcinoma. Those authors observed a favorable risk-benefit
profile with pazopanib, leading to a delay in HRQoL
deterioration compared with placebo. This delay in
HRQoL deterioration was related to a delay in PFS;
because, in that study, the development of disease progression was considered HRQoL deterioration by definition.
Recently, a direct comparison of sunitinib versus
2939

Original Article

pazopanib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma demonstrated similar efficacy but safety and quality-of-life profiles in favor of pazopanib.29 This was confirmed in a
patient preference study in which patients preferred pazopanib over sunitinib, citing quality of life in general and
fatigue in particular as important reasons.30
The prognostic value of the baseline GHS scores for
OS confirm previous reported findings that baseline
HRQoL scores can act as a universal prognostic factor
across many cancer disease sites.31 Patients who had GHS
scores <50 at baseline had lower OS but similar PFS, independent of the treatment arm. Normative scores for
GHS are typically approximately 65 to 70, depending on
age, sex, and other chronic diseases.32,33 Similar values
were observed at baseline in this trial, but the outcomes
tended to decline slightly to <60 over time.
Our study was not without limitations. A major constraint was the lack of HRQoL collection after progression,
especially because the treatment effect on PFS did not
translate into a significant OS benefit. Therefore, the question remains: How significant was the overall benefit of
pazopanib in terms of quality-adjusted life-years? In addition, the PFS benefit in the pazopanib arm caused lower
attrition rates and, thus, a longer HRQoL observation period compared with the placebo arm. Combined with a
general decline in HRQoL scores over time, lower scores in
the pazopanib arm may have been influenced by the higher
number of HRQoL observations in the treatment arm.
Missing data constitute a common challenge to
HRQoL assessment in clinical trials.34 Compliance in the
PALETTE trial was good and remained within acceptable
limits to allow the performance of analyses as intended.
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results, and an investigation into the causes of missing data revealed no systematic bias. Although the QLQ-C30 is often cited currently
as 1 of the most commonly used and validated measures
applied within the oncology clinical trials setting, when
applied to this particular study, several side-effect scales/
items or symptoms common to angiogenesis inhibitors
are lacking. Most notably absent are symptoms related to
hand-foot syndrome or skin reactions. These symptoms
represent a severe limitation to the patient when performing normal daily activities. Similar to hair loss for cytotoxic regimens, dermatologic problems may be
considered more important by patients because of their
chronicity, obvious appearance, and social impact, thus
affecting daily activities more than might be apparent
from a clinical perspective.
It should be noted that there is no questionnaire
specific for patients with advanced STS; and, given the
2940

heterogeneity of this disease, the development of such an
instrument may be challenging. The EORTC Quality-ofLife Group uses a module-based approach to questionnaire development, in which the core questionnaire
(EORTC QLQ-C30) is supplemented with diseasespecific, treatment-specific, or symptom-specific modules. Currently, no STS-specific module exists, but a
symptom-based module on targeted therapies is under
construction.35 Fatigue-specific instruments, such as the
EORTC QLQ-FA1336 or the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Treatment-Fatigue,37 could be a valuable consideration for future trials with angiogenesis inhibitors.
Conclusion

HRQoL was an important exploratory endpoint in this
comparison between pazopanib and placebo in patients
with advanced STS. The primary selected scale, the
EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS, revealed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the 2 treatment arms
at any time point. Sensitivity analyses confirmed this finding. The toxicity profile of pazopanib was reflected in
patients’ self-reported symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, and diarrhea) but did not translate into
significantly worse overall global health during treatment.
HRQoL scores tended to decline over time in both arms,
at least in part reflecting the underlying disease burden in
this patient population.
