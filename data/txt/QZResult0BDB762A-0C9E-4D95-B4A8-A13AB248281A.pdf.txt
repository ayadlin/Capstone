ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy is an effective weapon in the battle against cancer, but numerous
cancer patients are either not sensitive to chemotherapy or develop drug resistance
to current chemotherapy regimens. Therefore, an effective chemotherapy mechanism
that enhances tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics is urgently needed. The aim of
the present study was to determine the antitumor activity of dihydromyricetin (DHM)
on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its underlying mechanisms.
We demonstrated that DHM can markedly induce apoptotic cell death and autophagy
in HNSCC cells. Meanwhile, increased autophagy inhibited apoptosis. Pharmacological
or genetic inhibition of autophagy further sensitized the HNSCC cells to DHM-induced
apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis showed that the antitumor of DHM may be due to
the activation phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(p-STAT3), which contributed to autophagy. Importantly, DHM triggered reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation in the HNSCC cells and the levels of ROS decreased
with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. Moreover, NAC abrogated the effects
of DHM on STAT3-dependent autophagy. Overall, the following critical issues were
observed: first, DHM increased the p-STAT3-dependent autophagy by generating ROSsignaling pathways in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Second, inhibiting
autophagy could enhance DHM-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma.

because of their low toxicity and potent efficacy [46]. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a 2,3-dihydroflavonol
compound, is the main bioactive component extracted
from Ampelopsis grossedentata. Recently, DHM has been
shown to be effective in fighting certain cancer cells and
is therefore a promising drug in anticancer therapy [7-9].
Specifically, one study has revealed that DHM causes cell
cycle arrest in human hepatoma cells [10]. However, the
underlying mechanism remains obscure. Interestingly,
several studies have revealed that DHM could potently
stimulate autophagic flux [11, 12]. This finding indicates
that autophagy may be a novel mechanism by which
cancer cells respond to DHM.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
is the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide,
with more than 600,000 new cases reported each year [1].
Despite advances in multimodality treatment, the survival
rate of HNSCC patients has improved minimally and
persistent mortality is largely due to high rates of regional
metastasis, locoregional recurrence, and drug resistance
to current chemotherapy regimens [2, 3]. Therefore, new
agents with strong efficacy in HNSCC treatment need to
be developed.
A growing number of recent studies have focused
on chemopreventive activities of phytochemicals

DHM induces autophagy in HNSCC cells

Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved pathway,
plays a crucial role in degrading a wide variety of cellular
components [13, 14]. Autophagy can either suppress or
promote tumor cell growth in different cellular contexts [1518]. Although the circumstances under which autophagy
functions as a primary mechanism of cell death or survival
remain to be defined, a hypothesis is that autophagy
inhibition promotes apoptosis in cancer cells with intact
apoptotic signaling pathways [19, 20]. However, the exact
role and mechanism of autophagy in different cancer types
and different stages is crucial to identify new methods for
cancer therapy and to improve therapeutic efficiency. Signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) acts as a
signal transducer as well as a transcription factor, and plays
key roles in apoptosis resistance through which malignant
cells evade cell death [21]. Recent studies have suggested
a correlation among autophagic markers such as LC3B,
p62, Atg5, and active STAT3 in some human cancers [15,
20, 21], among which the cancers with the highest STAT3
expression showed an increased expression of autophagic
markers and had the worst outcome [15, 22].
In the present study, we report that DHM induces
obvious apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Meanwhile, apoptosis
is not the sole consequence of DHM deprivation, as
DHM treatment rapidly activates an autophagic process.
A link between DHM-induced autophagy and ROS
production has also been observed. Pharmacological
or genetic inhibition of STAT3-dependent autophagy
sensitized DHM-induced apoptosis in HNSCC. These
findings indicate that autophagy provides a cytoprotective
mechanism in HNSCC cells treated by DHM, and
inhibition of autophagy may improve the therapeutic
efficacy of DHM in HNSCC treatment.

Numerous studies show that autophagy induction
is a common event in cancer cells in response to various
chemotherapeutic treatments. [23-26] Thus, we examined
whether DHM induced autophagy. Microtubule-associated
protein light chain 3 (LC3) is a specific marker for
autophagy initiation. [20] Autophagosome formation
is invariably associated with conversion of LC3 from
the cytosolic LC3-I to the autophagosome-associated
LC3-II form. [27] We examined whether DHM induced
autophagy by LC3. First, we constructed a Cal27 cell
line that stably expresses the GFP–LC3 fusion protein
and used a fluorescent microscope to detect GFP–LC3
punctate dots [15]. As shown in Figure 2A, after treatment
with 50 μM DHM for 24 h, Cal27 cells displayed more
green fluorescence than negative controls. Moreover,
induction of autophagy was identified by two established
measurements of autophagy, that is, enhancement of
Beclin-1, a component of class III phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase complex essential for autophagosome formation,
and degradation of p62, a protein-facilitating autophagic
degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregation (Figure 2B
and 2C). The above experiment was repeated in the FaDu
cell line and yielded consistent results (Supplementary
Figure S2). These results demonstrated that DHM treatment
induced autophagic flux in HNSCC cells.

Inhibition of DHM-induced autophagy sensitized
HNSCC cells to DHM-induced apoptotic cell
death
Autophagy may serve as a pro-survival or prodeath mechanism in different cellular contexts [15-18].
Considering that manipulation of autophagy may improve
the efficacy of anticancer therapeutics, we were eager
to determine whether the DHM-elicited autophagy in
HNSCC favored cell survival or cell death. Beclin1 is an
essential protein for autophagy activation; thus, beclin1
deficiency can significantly interrupt autophagy. [27]
Therefore, to determine the precise role of autophagy in
DHM-exposed HNSCC cells, autophagy inhibition by
Beclin1-siRNA transfection was performed. Cal27 cells
transfected with Beclin-1 siRNA showed a reduced level of
LC3-II accumulation after DHM treatment compared with
a scrambled siRNA control, indicating the involvement of
Beclin-1 in DHM-mediated autophagy in HNSCC cells.
Meanwhile, starved cells that were used as a positive control
for autophagy exhibited significant green fluorescence
(Figure 3A). To monitor autophagic flux, we also measured
the levels of LC3II and cleaved PARP in the absence or
presence of CQ, a lysosome inhibitors, could lead to the
aggregation of autophagosomes and increase LC3-II level
by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.
[28] We found that a CQ challenge increased the level of
LC3II and cleaved PARP in Cal27 cells treated with 50
μM DHM (Figure 3B). In agreement with the data derived

RESULTS
DHM induces apoptosis in HNSCC cells
To determine whether DHM causes cell death by
apoptosis, Cal27 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
following Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide dual
labeling. As shown in Figure 1A, cells were treated
with different concentrations of DHM for 24 h or 50
μM DHM for 6, 12, and 24 h. We found that DHM
induced cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. As key executors of cell apoptosis, both cleaved
PARP and the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 proteins increased
in Cal27 cells when treated with DHM for 24 h or with
50 μM DHM for indicated time points (Figure 1B and
1C). We also found that treatment with DHM increased
Caspase-3 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 1D). Overall, these results demonstrate that
apoptosis was involved in the response of Cal27 cells
to DHM treatment. The in vitro inhibition experiment
was repeated in another cell line FaDu (Supplementary
Figure S1).

from pharmacological inhibitors, knockdown of Beclin-1 by
siRNA enhanced the cleaved PARP, as assayed by Western
blot analysis (Figure 3C), indicating that autophagy is
cytoprotective for DHM-induced apoptotic cell death. In
addition, DHM remarkably increased Caspase-3 activity
and cell death after Beclin-1-siRNA treatment (Figure 3E).
Moreover, the Caspase-3 activity results showed that the
pretreatment of Cal27 cells with CQ increased the number
of apoptotic cells and cell death (Figure 3D). These results
reveal that inhibition of DHM-induced autophagy sensitized
the HNSCC cells to DHM-induced apoptotic cell death.

DHM-induced ROS generation in blocking STAT3 signals.
In addition, pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC),
an ROS scavenger [34], reduced the ROS levels induced
by DHM (Figure 5C), increased Caspase-3 (Figure 5D),
and abrogated DHM-induced apoptosis (Figure 5E).
Incubation of cells with NAC for 1 h prior to treatment
with DHM revealed that inhibiting ROS generation
abrogated the effect of DHM on the phosphorylation of
STAT3 (Figure 5D). Moreover, pretreatment with NAC
averted the DHM-induced expression of p62, degradation
of LC3 II/LC3 I, and enhancement of Beclin 1 (Figure
5D). These results indicated that DHM-induced ROS was
an upstream signaling molecule that activates the STAT3dependent autophagy pathway in HNSCC cells.

DHM induced autophagy through activating
STAT3 pathway in HNSCC cells
STAT3 is a transcription factor that can be activated
by IL-6, EGF, and other cytokines, and plays a key role
in various biological processes, such as inflammation,
cell proliferation, migration, survival, and metabolic
disorders [21]. Recent studies have suggested a correlation
between autophagy and the activity of STAT3 in human
cancer [15, 20, 21]. Thus, we investigated whether STAT3
is involved in DHM action in HNSCC cells. Western
blot analysis showed that DHM increased the levels
of p-STAT3T705 in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 4A and 4B). To further confirm the exact role of
STAT3 signaling, we characterized the effects of DHM
in cells in which STAT3 was decreased with NSC74859,
an inhibitor of the dimerization and phosphorylation
of STAT3. After incubation with DHM at an indicated
concentration, downregulated STAT3 can inhibit DHMinduced autophagy. The levels of LC3 II/LC3 I was
suppressed, indicating that autophagy was increased by
activating p-STAT3T705 expression. Moreover, Cl-PARP
levels increased when p-STAT3T705 was suppressed (Figure
4C). These results suggested that DHM induced autophagy
through activating STAT3 pathways in HNSCC cells.

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy is an effective weapon in the battle
against cancer, but numerous cancer patients are either
not sensitive to chemotherapy or develop chemotherapy
resistance to current chemotherapy regimens, thereby
significantly diminishing clinical outcomes [35, 36]. To
overcome this challenge, developing several potentially
useful therapeutic agents is urgently needed.
Recent studies have demonstrated that DHM has
many biologic effects, including antioxidant [37], antitumor [12], and anti-alcohol intoxication activities [38],
but the precise molecular mechanisms by which DHM
exerts its anticancer effects remain poorly understood.
Jin Hong-yong et al. [39] found that DHM induces
cell apoptosis through a p53-related pathway in AGS
human gastric cancer cells. Xie Jun et al. [40] used a
carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury model to
demonstrate that DHM alleviated the injury through a
JNK-dependent mechanism. Jiang Liang-gui et al. [41]
showed that DHM enhanced the chemosensitivity of
nedaplatin through regulation of the p53/Bcl-2 pathway
in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the results
of these basic studies were unsatisfactory because of
the problem induced by drug resistance. In the present
study, we conducted experiments and determined that
the treatment of HNSCC cells with DHM resulted in the
induction of cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we investigated
the expression of autophagic markers such as LC3,
Beclin1, and p62 in HNSCC cells treated with DHM,
and we found that autophagic markers were upregulated.
Overall, these results suggested that apoptosis was not
the sole consequence of DHM deprivation because DHM
treatment rapidly activated an autophagic process. We
also propose a novel mechanism in which DHM increased
the p-STAT3-dependent autophagy by generating ROSsignaling pathways in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (Figure 6).
Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved pathway,
plays a crucial role in degrading a wide variety of cellular
components, such as peroxisomes, the endoplasmic

ROS is an upstream signaling molecule that

pathway
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is found to be
correlated with autophagy [17, 29-31]. We speculate that
ROS may be also involved in DHM-mediated autophagy
induction in HNSCC cells. To examine this hypothesis,
the ROS levels were determined in DHM-treated Cal 27
cells by DCF-DA staining. The elevated ROS levels were
proportionally correlated with increasing concentrations
of DHM: 50 μM DHM for 12 h or 25 μM for 24 h can
significantly generate ROS as revealed by DCFH-DA
staining (Figure 5A and 5B). The importance of ROSSTAT in cancer therapy has been reported. A recent study
shows Cetuximab and oxaliplatin exhibited antagonistic
effects on cellular proliferation and apoptosis through
ROS-STAT regulation [32, 33]. So we examined the role of

reticulum, and mitochondria [13]. Although drug-induced
autophagic tumor cell death has been reported [39, 42],
results from most studies support the survival role of
autophagy in chemotherapy-induced cell death [15, 20].
Thus, a potential reason for the treatment failure in cancer
therapy may be the pro-survival role of autophagy induced
by DHM. Thus, we conducted experiments and found that
pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy leads
to increased DHM-induced apoptosis, thereby indicating
that DHM-mediated autophagy was a pro-survival rather
than a pro-death mechanism.
To further explore the mechanism of how DHM
triggers autophagy, we conducted Western blot to detect
the potential proteins involved. STAT3 acts as a signal
transducer as well as a transcription factor, and plays key
roles in apoptosis resistance through which malignant
cells evade death [43]. Recent studies have suggested a
correlation among autophagic markers such as LC3B,
p62, Atg5, and active STAT3 in some human cancers [15,
20, 21], among which the cancers with the higher STAT3
expression showed increased expression of autophagic
markers and exhibited the worst outcome [15, 22]. In
the present study, to detect whether STAT3 was involved
in DHM-induced autophagy, we evaluated the level of
phosphorylated STAT3. We found that DHM treatment
led to an increase p-STAT3 level. To further illustrate
the role of STAT3 signaling in DHM-induced autophagy,
STAT3 was blocked by NSC74859 (also known as S3I201), an inhibitor of the dimerization and phosphorylation
of STAT3 [44]; we found that blocking p-STAT3 could

suppress DHM-induced autophagy. Inhibited STAT3dependent autophagy significantly increased DHMinduced apoptosis.
However, the question remains as to which
mechanism mediates the effect of DHM on the
enhancement of p-STAT3 expression. Recent evidence
suggested that the accumulation of ROS has been linked
to multiple pathologies, including neurodegenerative
diseases [45], cancer [46], and premature aging [47].
Charlie Mantel et al. [48] demonstrated that phenotyped
STAT3−/− mice exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction
and increased ROS. Thus, we subsequently examined the
correlation between DHM-induced ROS generation and
p-STAT3. We found that following the DHM exposure
of cancer cells, this agent induced ROS in a time- and
dose-dependent manner, an effect that was abolished
by pretreatment of cells with NAC. Furthermore, the
incubation of HNSCC cells with NAC for 1 h prior to
DHM treatment revealed that inhibiting ROS generation
abrogated the effect of DHM on p-STAT3. Considering
these results, we suggested that ROS was an important
cellular mediator that triggers the STAT3-dependent
pathway after DHM administration in HNSCC cells.
Thus, we report that DHM induces obvious
apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Meanwhile, apoptosis is not
the sole consequence of DHM deprivation because DHM
treatment rapidly activates an autophagic process. A link
between DHM-induced autophagy and ROS production
are also observed. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition

of GFP-LC3 punctate structures was examined as
previously described [50].

Caspase-3 activity assay
Caspase-3 activity was determined using a
colorimetric assay based on the ability of caspase-3
to change acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp p-nitroanilide
(Ac-DEVD-pNA) into a yellow formazan product
(p-nitroanilide (pNA)). An increase in the absorbance at
405 nm was used to quantify the activation of caspase-3
activity. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and then
were lysed with lysis buffer for 15 min on ice. The
cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 g for 10 min at
4°C. Caspase-3 activity in the supernatant was assayed
using the kit (Beyotime, China). Caspase-3 activity was
expressed as a percentage of the enzyme activity compared
with that of the control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and reagents
Dihydromyricetin, NSC74859 was purchased
from Selleck (Houston, TX). N-acetyl cysteine (NAC),
Chloroquine (CQ) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). Stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), stored at −20°C, and diluted in fresh medium for
each experiment. The final concentration of DMSO did not
exceed 0.1% in any of the experiments to prevent toxicity
to cells. Antibodies against p-STAT3 (T705), STAT3, LC3,
and PARP were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly,
MA, USA); antibodies against Beclin-1, Bcl-2, p62 and
Bax were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Gibco (Life
Technologies Gibco/BRL, New York, NY, USA). Beclin1
siRNAs were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). Lipofectamine 2000 was bought from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Western blot analysis
HNSC cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of DHM pretreated with or without CQ
for 24 h. Then the cells were harvested and washed with
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The proteins were
extracted with RIPA Cell Lysis Buffer (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Haimen, China), and kept on ice for at
least 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g at
4°C for 10 min, then the supernatant was transferred to a
fresh tube. After protein concentration was measured by
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, an equal quantity
of total protein per lane was separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and powder in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline
and Tween 20 (TBST) for 1h at room temperature, then
incubated overnight at 4°C with specialized antibodies.
After overnight incubation, membranes were washed for
three times and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Then blots were developed by West Pico enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo) [51].

Cell lines
Human HNSCC cell lines Cal27 and Fadu were
bought from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco)
[49]. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of
95% air 5% CO2 at 37°C and experiments were performed
on 4th and 5th passages generated from the frozen stock.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was quantified with an Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions as
previous described [15].

Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)

GFP-LC3 analysis

The accumulated cells were treated with
dihydromyricetin in the presence or absence of NAC for 2
h and then loaded with 5 mM DCF-DA. After incubation
for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, the cells were
washed twice with HBSS solution and suspended in the
complete media, and the fluorescence emission at 525
nm following excitation at 488 nm was measured using a
microplate reader. The cellular fluorescence intensity was
expressed as the fold change relative to the level observed
in the control cells.

Cal27 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were
obtained by transfecting the cells with EGFP-LC3
plasmid and selected with G418. Transfection using
Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent was carried out according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection, cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and fresh DMEM was added for further incubation.
The images were photographed using a fluorescence

determined the significant differences between the
treatment groups. A P value less than 0.05 was used to
indicate statistical significance; all of the tests were
two-sided, and no corrections were applied for multiple
significance testing. All of the experiments were repeated
at least three times. Drug and biomarker distributions are
represented as the mean values±s.e.m.*, and **, indicate
P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively.
