ABSTRACT
Elevated expression of Survivin correlates with poor prognosis, tumor recurrence,
and drug resistance in various human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). The underlying mechanism of Survivin upregulation in cancer cells remains
elusive. To date, no Survivin-targeted therapy has been approved for cancer treatment.
Here, we explored the molecular basis resulting in Survivin overexpression in NSCLC
and investigated the antitumor activity of the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat in
combination with paclitaxel. Our data showed that entinostat significantly enhanced
paclitaxel-mediated anti-proliferative/anti-survival effects on NSCLC cells in vitro
and in vivo. Mechanistically, entinostat selectively decreased expression of Survivin
via induction of miR-203 (in vitro and in vivo) and miR-542-3p (in vitro). Moreover,
analysis of NSCLC patient samples revealed that the expression levels of miR-203
were downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation in 45% of NSCLC tumors. In
contrast, increased expression of both DNA methytransferase I (DNMT1) and Survivin
was observed and significantly correlated with the reduced miR-203 in NSCLC.
Collectively, these data shed new lights on the molecular mechanism of Survivin
upregulation in NSCLC. Our findings also support that the combinatorial treatments of
entinostat and paclitaxel will likely exhibit survival benefit in the NSCLC patients with
overexpression of DNMT1 and/or Survivin. The DNMT1-miR-203-Survivin signaling
axis may provide a new avenue for the development of novel epigenetic approaches
to enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy against NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

Although a number of new therapies have been developed
for the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
[4], which accounts for 85% to 90% of all lung cancer
cases [5], the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced
NSCLC remains low [6].
Survivin, the smallest member of IAP (inhibitor
of apoptosis) family, is overexpressed in tumors, but not
normal tissues [7, 8]. Increased Survivin correlates with

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths worldwide [1, 2]. The current treatment for
lung cancer patients who have been diagnosed at an early
stage is surgical resection followed by chemotherapy.
However, majority of the patients will eventually experience
disease progression and require further treatment [3].

poor prognosis, tumor recurrence, and drug resistance
in a wide variety of human cancers, including NSCLC
[9, 10]. Several approaches, such as the transcriptional
inhibitor of Survivin YM155, antisense oligonucleotides,
immunotherapy, and gene therapy have been designed
to inhibit Survivin for cancer treatment [10, 11]. YM155
is the most advanced studied and actively under clinical
evaluations (http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/results?term=
YM155&Search=Search). A recent Phase II trial indicates
that YM155 is safe, but it fails to increase the response
rates to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC
[12]. This failure is likely due to YM155’s insufficient
inhibition of Survivin. It is believed that novel strategy
effectively downregulating Survivin is required to enhance
chemotherapeutic efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC
patients. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism of
Survivin upregulation in NSCLC remains unclear.
Currently, the platinum-based doublet regimens
containing paclitaxel and cisplatin are the standard of
care for advanced NSCLC [13]. Paclitaxel, either as
monotherapy or combined with other agents, has shown
potent anti-NSCLC activity [14, 15]. However, both de
novo and acquired resistance to paclitaxel frequently occurs
and represents a huge clinical problem [16]. We showed
that overexpression of erbB3 upregulated Survivin to confer
paclitaxel resistance in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer
cells [17]. Inhibition of Survivin via a shRNA or an antierbB3 antibody (Ab) significantly increased the cytotoxicity
of paclitaxel [17, 18]. In identifying novel approach targeting
of erbB3, we discovered that the class I histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor entinostat specifically increased miR125a, miR-125b, and miR-205, which acted in concert to
inhibit erbB3, and subsequently induced apoptosis in erbB2overexpressing breast cancer cells [19, 20]. Entinostat exerts
potent antitumor activity in a number of cancers [21]. Its
clinic activity against NSCLC is being tested in combination
with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor Azacitidine
or EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib (Tarceva), but not conventional
chemotherapy (http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/results?ter
m=entinostat&Search=Search). While epigenetic therapy
emerges as a new strategy to overcome drug resistance
and re-sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy [22, 23], we
wondered whether entinostat might possess such activity as
a chemo-sensitizer via inhibition of Survivin. In the current
report, we investigated the mechanism of action of entinostat
in potentiation of paclitaxel-mediated antitumor activity
against NSCLC. We have also explored the molecular basis
responsible for Survivin overexpression in NSCLC.

entinostat combined with paclitaxel in NSCLC cell lines.
While entinostat alone slightly reduced proliferation of A549
and H460 cells, it significantly increased paclitaxel-mediated
growth inhibition in both lines (Figure 1A). This data was
supported by clonogenic assays showing that combinations
of entinostat and paclitaxel as compared to either agent alone
dramatically reduced the colony numbers (Figure 1B). To
evaluate whether the combinatorial inhibition via a similar
mechanism observed in breast cancer and multiple myeloma
cells [24, 25], we examined the effects of entinostat and/or
paclitaxel on induction of apoptosis. Treatment of A549 or
H460 cells with both entinostat and paclitaxel, but not either
agent alone, clearly induced PARP cleavage, a hallmark
of apoptosis, and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3
(Figure 1C). An ELISA measuring histone-associated
DNA fragments further confirmed that the cells underwent
apoptotic cell death upon the combinatorial treatments
(Figure 1D). These data indicate that entinostat significantly
enhances paclitaxel-induced anti-proliferative/anti-survival
effects on NSCLC cells associated with caspase-dependent
apoptosis.

Entinostat selectively inhibits Survivin
independent of PI-3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
To explore the mechanism by which entinostat
potentiates paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells,
we first examined several anti-apoptosis proteins, including
Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and Survivin in A549 and H460 cells.
Entinostat markedly decreased both protein and mRNA
levels of Survivin, but not Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, in a timeand dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A and 2B). Although
entinostat inhibited PI-3K/Akt signaling and activation
of the PI-3K/Akt pathway led to Survivin upregulation
in breast cancer cells [17, 19], it had no effect on
phosphorylation of Akt (P-Akt) and MAPK (P-MAPK) in
NSCLC cells (Figure 2C). Consistently, specific inhibitor of
PI-3K (LY294002), Akt (Akt1/2 inhibitor VIII), or mTOR
(rapamycin) did not alter Survivin expression (Figure 2D).
We next studied whether the reduction of Survivin played
a causal role for entinostat to potentiate paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Survivin in A549 or H460
cells abrogated entinostat enhancement of paclitaxelinduced PARP cleavage, activation of caspase-8 and -3 and
DNA fragmentation (Figure 3). Finally, we tested whether
Survivin reduction was able to enhance the cytotoxicity
of paclitaxel. Two verified shRNA sequences were used
to downregulate Survivin [17]. As expected, specific
knockdown of Survivin not only enhanced paclitaxelmediated growth inhibition, but also significantly increased
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S1).
Collectively, our data demonstrate that entinostat elicits
a PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-independent mechanism to
downregulate Survivin, which is essential for entinostat
to potentiate paclitaxel-mediated cytotoxicity in NSCLC
cells.

Entinostat downregulates Survivin via induction
of miR-203 and miR-542-3p

a more potent activity than single mimic to significantly
potentiate paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Figure 5C and 5D).
The miRNA mimics largely recapitulated entinostat’s
activity to enhance paclitaxel cytotoxicity. We then sought to
understand if the induction of miR-203 and/or miR-542-3p
was required for entinostat-induced downregulation of
Survivin. The lentiviral miRZip-203 or miRZip-542-3p
was applied to specifically inhibit miR-203 or miR-542-3p,
respectively. High efficiency of lentiviral infection of
NSCLC cells was evidenced by visualization of GFP
(Supplementary Figure S2). While either miRZip-203 or
miRZip-542-3p had little effect on entinostat-mediated
reduction of Survivin, inhibition of both miR-203 and miR542-3p attenuated entinostat’s inhibitory effect on Survivin
(Figure 6A), suggesting that miR-203 and miR-542-3p
worked cooperatively in entinostat action to downregulate
Survivin. As a consequence, simultaneous inhibition of
miR-203 and miR-542-3p significantly reversed entinostat
enhancement of paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition
and apoptosis (Figure 6B–6D). Taken together, our data
indicate that both miR-203 and miR-542-3p contribute to
entinostat-mediated reduction of Survivin; and upregulation
of the two miRNAs is necessary and sufficient for entinostat
potentiation of paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

As miRNAs emerge as important regulators of
gene expression by targeting mRNA for degradation
or translational repression [26], we asked if entinostat
might modulate specific miRNAs to control Survivin
expression in NSCLC cells. Quantitative real-time (qRT)PCR showed that entinostat significantly induced miR203 and miR-542-3p, two Survivin-targeting miRNAs
[27, 28], in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 4).
It had no effect on Let-7c and miR-29b, which have been
reported to target Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, respectively [29, 30].
It appeared that chemotherapy alone had no effect on the
miRNAs in vitro, as treatment of A549 or H460 cells with
paclitaxel did not alter the expression of either miR-203 or
miR-542-3p (Data not shown). We next explored whether the
induction of miR-203 and/or miR-542-3p was sufficient to
inhibit Survivin. While transfection with the mimic of either
miR-203 or miR-542-3p slightly decreased Survivin, the
combinations of both miRNA mimics profoundly reduced
Survivin in A549 and H460 cells (Figure 5A). It seemed that
miR-542-3p or two miRNA mimic(s) were more effective
than miR-203 mimic to enhance paclitaxel-induced growth
inhibition (Figure 5B). Moreover, two mimics exhibited

Entinostat enhances the antitumor activity of
paclitaxel against NSCLC in vivo

[18, 21]. Importantly, the combinations of entinostat and
paclitaxel exhibited a more potent antitumor activity than
either agent (Figure 7A). The bioluminescence signals were
monitored by IVIS-200 image system, which showed that
treatment with both entinostat and paclitaxel profoundly
reduced the luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure S4).
To examine the effects of entinostat and/or paclitaxel
on proliferation and apoptosis in vivo, the tumors were
subjected to IHC analyses of Ki-67, cleaved caspase-3, and
Survivin. Mice treated with paclitaxel retained a similar
number of tumor cells positively staining for Survivin or
Ki-67 as control mice, whereas entinostat significantly
reduced Survivin- and Ki-67-staining cells. Combinations
of entinostat and paclitaxel further decreased Survivin- and
Ki-67-positive cells. The tumors from mice treated with
either entinostat or paclitaxel had a minor, but significant
induction of cleaved caspase-3. However, entinostat

To determine whether entinostat holds potential to
enhance paclitaxel’s antitumor activity in vivo, we took
advantage of tumor xenograft models established from
A549 or H460 cells. The firefly luciferase-labelled A549
(A549-Fluc) and H460 (H460-Fluc) cells were first tested
in vitro, and found that their luciferase activity was
in a linear association with the cell numbers seeded
(Supplementary Figure S3). We then injected A549-Fluc
or H460-Fluc cells into nude mice to establish tumor
xenografts. Tumor-bearing mice were then treated with
intraperitoneal injection of either PBS, or entinostat, or
paclitaxel, or both entinostat and paclitaxel. Paclitaxel
slightly reduced tumor growth, whereas entinostat showed
clear antitumor effects, consistent with previous findings

combined with paclitaxel markedly increased cleaved
caspase-3 (Figure 7B and 7C). Interestingly, entinostat
significantly upregulated miR-203 (not miR-542-3p); and
this induction was further enhanced when entinostat was
combined with paclitaxel (Figure 7D). Thus, our studies
indicate that entinostat, likely through upregulation of
miR-203, potentiates the antitumor activity of paclitaxel
against NSCLC via inhibition of cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in vivo.

is conceivable to hypothesize that overexpression of
DNMT1 may lead to epigenetic silencing of miRNAs to
upregulate Survivin, and thereby compromise the efficacy
of paclitaxel in NSCLC patients. To test this hypothesis,
we first examined the expression of miR-203 and miR-5423p as well as Survivin and DNMT1 in 20 freshly-obtained
NSCLC samples and their self-paired normal adjacent
lung tissues (Table 1). We noticed that the mRNA levels
of both Survivin and DNMT1 were significantly elevated in
NSCLC as compared to normal lung tissues (Figure 10A).
Independent-samples t-tests revealed that the means of
relative mRNA values of Survivin and DNMT1 in tumors
were 8.73-fold and 3.85-fold higher than that of normal
tissues, respectively (Table 2). Increased protein levels of
Survivin and DNMT1 were also found in 8 of 20 NSCLC
samples as compared to normal lung tissues (Figure 10B).
To confirm the positive correlation between Survivin and
DNMT1, we then retrospectively examined the expression
of DNMT1 and Survivin in a set of tissue sections consisting
of 61 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We observed that
the staining rates for DNMT1 in NSCLCs and their selfpaired normal adjacent lung tissues were 47.5% (29/61) and
36% (22/61), respectively. The staining rates for Survivin
in NSCLCs and normal lung tissues were 47.5% (29/61)
and 37.7% (23/61), respectively (Supplementary Table S4).
Consistent with the western blot data, elevated expression
of DNMT1 and Survivin in NSCLC tumors was supported
by IHC analyses (Figure 10C). Evaluation of the IHC scores
showed that expression of both DNMT1 and Survivin was
significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma than that in
normal lung tissues (Figure 10D). The positive correlation
between DNMT1 and Survivin was highly significant
in both tumors (r = 0.919, P = 0.000) and normal tissues
(r = 0.983, P = 0.000) (Figure 10E). Interestingly, the
expression levels of DNMT1 were shown to be significantly
correlated with TNM stages as well as age of the patients
(r = 1, P < 0.0001 by Spearman rank test), while weakly
correlated with gender of the patients (r = 0.30175,
P = 0.0181 by Spearman rank test). As such, a strong
correlation between the expression of Survivin and
TNM stages, but not age or gender of the patients were
also revealed by Spearman rank test (Supplementary
Table S6). Overall, our clinical analyses suggest that
elevated expression of DNMT1 significantly correlates
with increased Survivin in NSCLC, especially lung
adenocarcinoma.

Entinostat elicits hypomethylation of miR-203
promoter and downregulation of DNMT1
The expression of miR-203 is frequently
downregulated due to promoter methylation in cancers
of breast, prostate, liver, and hematologic malignancies
[31– 36]. To date, there is no such report in NSCLC. Although
the expression levels of miR-203 are much lower in lung
cancer cell lines than that in normal bronchial epithelial cells
[37], it is unclear if this reduction is due to miR-203 promoter
methylation. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) showed
that treatment with entinostat lowered miR-203 promoter
methylation and increased unmethylation levels (Figure 8A),
implying that entinostat might induce miR-203 in NSCLC
cells via demethylation of miR-203 promoter. DNA
methylation is primarily controlled by a group of enzymes
called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), among which
only DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B possess catalytic
activity [38, 39]. While DNMT3A and DNMT3B are
de novo enzymes methylating previously unmethylated
DNA, DNMT1 is mainly used to maintain DNA methylation
status [40]. It has been shown that DNMT1 stability is
regulated by a mechanism involving in acetylation-driven
ubiquitination [41], and HDAC inhibition promotes
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of DNMT1 in breast cancer
cells [42]. We therefore investigated the effects of entinostat
on DNMTs in A549 and H460 cells, and discovered that
entinostat reduced the protein and mRNA levels of DNMT1,
but not DNMT3A and DNMT3B, in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 8B–8D). To test if entinostat exhibited
a similar activity in vivo, we performed western blot
analysis using the tumors described in Figure 7. DNMT1
was clearly decreased in the tumors from mice treated with
entinostat (not paclitaxel). Strikingly, the combinatorial
treatment of entinostat and paclitaxel resulted in most
significant reduction of DNMT1 (Figure 9). This additive/
synergistic inhibition on DNMT1 was also observed in vitro
(Supplementary Figure S5). Taken together, our data suggest
that entinostat elicits miR-203 promoter hypomethylation
via reduction of DNMT1 in vitro and in vivo, and thereby
enhances expression of this miRNA in NSCLC cells.

Hypermethylation of miR-203 promoter is
associated with lower levels of miR-203 and
higher levels of both DNMT1 and Survivin in
NSCLC tumors

expression is observed in NSCLC samples

We next focused our clinical studies on miR-203 and
miR-542-3p. QRT-PCR analyses found that the expression
levels of miR-203, but not miR-542-3p were significantly
decreased in NSCLCs as compared to that in normal lung
tissues (Figure 11A). To explore if miR-203 reduction

in NSCLC; 2) although miR-542-3p contributes to
entinostat-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in
vitro, it has little effect on entinostat potentiation of
paclitaxel efficacy in vivo. Collectively, our studies
indicate that inhibition of DNMT1 is at least one of
the major mechanisms for entinostat to lift epigenetic
silencing of miR-203, which results in downregulation
of Survivin and thereby enhances paclitaxel-mediated
antitumor activity against NSCLC (Figure 12).
Our data is supported by a recent report showing that
the pan-HDACi vorinostat or panobinostat significantly
promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis in A549 and H460
cells [43]. Further studies revealed that inhibition of
HDAC 1, 2 and 3 with entinostat potentiated cisplatininduced apoptosis in A549 cells [43]. Our conclusions
seemed to be different from the findings of another report
[44], which showed that epigenetic therapy (azacitidine
plus entinostat) did not alter selected NSCLC cells’
responsiveness to cisplatin, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and
vinorelbine in vitro and in vivo. In addition to the fact
that paclitaxel was not tested in the later study [44], this
disparity might be explained by the distinct treatment
regimens used. 1) We and Riley et al. [43] combined
entinostat with chemotherapy (paclitaxel in our study and
cisplatin in Riley’s) simultaneously, whereas sequential
treatment - epigenetic therapy followed by chemotherapy
- was evaluated by Vendetti et al. [44]. 2) While epigenetic
therapy consisting of both azacitidine and entinostat was
used by Vendetti et al. only entinostat was applied in
our study and Riley’s. Thus, the doses of entinostat in

Vendetii’s study were much lower than that used in ours
and Riley’s. Nonetheless, the doses of entinostat we used
are still within the clinically-relevant range [21]. Although
the data by Vendetti [44] call into question whether
epigenetic agents could potentiate chemotherapy in cancer
treatment, it is possible that their models and sequential
treatments do not fully reflect the genetic and/or epigenetic
alterations in a subset of NSCLC patients who may benefit
from epigenetic priming. Our data support that further
evaluation in both preclinical models and clinical trials to
test the therapeutic potential of entinostat in combination
with paclitaxel against NSCLC is warranted.
Elevated expression of Survivin is observed in
almost all types of human malignancies and positively
correlates with poor prognosis, tumor recurrence, and drug
resistance [9, 10]. However, the molecular mechanisms
controlling Survivin expression in cancers have not been
fully elucidated. Recent studies show that a number of
miRNAs, including miR-203 and miR-542-3p, play
critical roles in regulating Survivin expression in cancer
cells [45]. Nonetheless, majority of the studies are carried
out in preclinical models, it is currently unknown whether
the expression of miR-203 and/or miR-542-3p is altered
in NSCLC tumors. Our analysis suggests that miR-203 is
frequently downregulated due to promoter methylation in
NSCLC, and the reduced miR-203 is inversely correlated
with the expression of Survivin and DNMT1 (Figure 11D).
These findings support the importance of specific miRNA
in regulation of Survivin expression. Thus, it is conceivable
to hypothesize that novel therapies which are able to induce

Figure 12: Proposed model underlying the mechanism of entinostat potentiation of paclitaxel-mediated antitumor
activity against NSCLC. Entinostat enhances expression of miR-203 (in vitro and in vivo) and miR-542-3p (in vitro) via inhibition of
HDAC, downregulation of DNMT1, and/or other mechanisms to reduce Survivin, and thereby potentiate paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in
NSCLC cells. The combinations of entinostat and paclitaxel exert potent antitumor activity against NSCLC likely due to dramatic reduction
of DNMT1 through an unknown mechanism to release promoter methylation-mediated epigenetic silencing of miR-203.

expression of miR-203 will effectively downregulate
Survivin, and therefore sensitize the cancer cells to paclitaxel
treatment. Our data presented in this manuscript with
entinostat to enhance miR-203 expression strongly support
this notion. Our studies with the second set of clinical
samples (Figure 10 and Supplementary Table S5 & S6)
seem to suggest that there is a significant correlation
between DNMT1 and Survivin in adenocarcinoma.
However, after careful analysis of all of our clinical data,
we could not rule out the possibility that this correlation
may also occur in squamous cell carcinoma. Our first set
of clinical samples (20 freshly-obtained NSCLC samples)
contains 10 squamous cell carcinomas (Figure 11D, Table 1
and Supplementary Table S3). Among these squamous cell
carcinomas, increased mRNA expression of both DNMT1
and Survivin has been shown in 4 of them (#6, #11, #15, and
#20). Thus, to determine whether the correlation of DNMT1
and Survivin may have preference towards certain histology
subtypes of NSCLC, we need to expand the population of
patients with all subtypes in our future work.
DNA methylation has long been recognized as a
key player in tumor initiation and progression [46]. Yet,
epigenetic and genetic mechanisms often intertwine
and take advantage of each other during tumorigenesis
[47]. Our discovery that increased DNMT1 negatively
correlates with miR-203 expression in NSCLC offers a
representative paradigm regarding the cross-talk between
genetic and epigenetic alterations. As a global enzyme
maintaining DNA methylation status, how does the
dysregulated DNMT1 link to specific silencing of miR203 in NSCLC is an unsolved question. A recent study
reveals that a long noncoding RNA termed ecCEBPA is
critical for regulation of DNA methylation at a particular
site via interaction with DNMT1 [48]. Whether a similar
mechanism accounts for miR-203 promoter methylation in
NSCLC by DNMT1 awaits further investigation.
In summary, we demonstrate that entinostat
downregulates Survivin via induction of miR-203 and
miR-542-3p in vitro and/or in vivo, and thereby potentiates
paclitaxel-mediated antitumor activity against NSCLC.
Clinical studies show that increased DNMT1 positively
correlates with miR-203 promoter methylation and
overexpression of Survivin in NSCLC tumors. These
findings shed new lights on the underlying mechanism of
Survivin upregulation in NSCLC. Our data suggest that
the addition of entinostat to paclitaxel-based regimens in
selected NSCLC patients with increased DNMT1 and/or
Survivin may exhibit significant survival benefit.

euthanized according to approved protocol. Tumors were
excised and subjected to immunohistochemistry analyses
and qRT-PCR measurement of miRNA expression.

Bioluminescence imaging
The IVIS200 instru­
ment (Caliper Life Sciences,
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was used. For cultured cells,
we imaged luciferase signal by adding PBS or d-luciferin at
a concentration of 0.15 mg/mL. For monitoring luciferaselabeled tumor cells in vivo, mice to be imaged were i.p.
injected with 150 mg/kg body weight of d-luciferin in
200 μl of PBS and then anesthetized with continuous flow
of isofluorane. Imaging of the mice was carried out 10 min
later. All images were processed by manu­facturer-supplied
software for quantitative analysis.

Production of lentivirus
Lentiviral production was performed as described
[17, 51]. In brief, the lentiviral expression vector pLKO.1ConshRNA or pLKO.1-SurshRNA; pLEX-Luc or pLEXhSurvivin; miRZip control, miRZip-203, or miRZip-542-3p
and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were
co-transfected into HEK293T cells. After 24 h, the culture
media were changed with fresh media. The virus-containing
media were collected, aliquot and stored at −80°C.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was performed as described previously [18, 52].
The specificity of all antibodies - Ki-67 (rabbit monoclonal
SP6; dilution 1:500 in TBST + 1% BSA), cleaved caspase-3
(rabbit polyclonal; 1:1,000), Survivin (Epitomics; rabbit
monoclonal EP2880Y; 1:100), DNMT1 (Epitomics; rabbit
monoclonal EPR3521-2; 1:300) - has been confirmed by
both positive and negative controls. Antibody complexes
were visualized with IP Flex DAB (Biocare). All sections
were counterstained in Mayer’s hematoxylin, nuclei blued
in 1% ammonium hydroxide, cleared in xylene and cover
glass mounted by synthetic resin.

Specific inhibition of miRNA expression with a
lentiviral system
Lentiviral miRZip expression system (scramble
control, miRZip-203, or miRZip-542-3p) was applied to
fulfill specific inhibition of miR-203 or miR-542-3p in
NSCLC cells.

Analysis of miRNA expression
The expression of mature miR-203, miR-542-3p,
Let-7c, miR-29b, and RNU6B was measured by RTPCR using TaqMan Assays (Applied Biosystems) as
described previously [20]. The relative miRNA levels
were calculated using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt).

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
MSP for DNA methylation was performed as
described by Chim et al. [36]. Treatment of DNA with
bisulfite for conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil
was performed with the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen).
Primers used for MSP and unmethylation-specific
PCR (USP) were shown in Supplementary Table S1.
PCR products were loaded onto 1.5% agarose gels and
electrophoresed. The images were obtained by exposure
of the gels to an ultraviolet trans-illuminator and recorded
with Fluor-S™ Multimager (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

Tumor xenograft model
Athymic nu/nu mice (Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) were maintained in
accordance with the IACUC procedures and guidelines.
Five × 106 A549-Fluc or H460-Fluc cells were suspended
in 100 μL of PBS, mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 5-week-old
female mice. Tumor formation was assessed by palpation
and measured with fine calipers three times a week. Tumor
volume was calculated by the formula: Volume = (Length ×
Width2)/2, which was statistically analyzed as we described
previously [18, 52]. When tumors reach ~150 mm3, mice
were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 4 and
n = 3 for A549-Fluc and H460-Fluc cells, respectively):
1) control mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
100 μl of PBS; 2) mice received i.p. injection of entinostat
(25 mg/kg for A549-Fluc or 12.5 mg/kg for H460-Fluc) in
100 μl PBS twice a week; 3) mice received i.p. injection
of paclitaxel (7.5 mg/kg) in 100 μl PBS twice a week;
4) mice received i.p. injection of entinostat and paclitaxel
in 100 μl PBS twice a week. At the end of study, mice were

Statistical analysis
All results were confirmed by at least three
independent experiments. Data are presented as
mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Institute). Student’s t tests
were used for comparisons of means of quantitative
data between groups. The correlations between miR-203
promoter methylation and miR-203 expression, between
miR-203 and Survivin expression, and between DNMT1
and Survivin expression were evaluated by Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (r). Values of P < 0.05 were
considered significant.
