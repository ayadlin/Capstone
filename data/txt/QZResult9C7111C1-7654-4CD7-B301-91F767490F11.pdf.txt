ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to initiate tumor growth and be
resistant to chemoradiotherapy, and these processes appear to be closely related to
CSC quiescence. Here, a CSC-like cell population with a high level of CD44 expression
was obtained from the human gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and MKN74. Using a
PKH26-labeling retention assay, quiescent CSC-like cells with low levels of Ki67 and
PCNA expression were found in spheres formed in serum-free medium, and exhibited
resistance to drug and radiation treatments. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and ribosomal
S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) were silenced in the quiescent CSC-like cells. The Plk1-specific
inhibitors inhibited the activation of RSK1 and induced quiescence in the CSC-like
cells, but increased RSK1 activity and resulted in apoptosis in non-CSCs. Furthermore,
RSK1 silencing by inhibitors activated Plk1 and had no effect on the growth of spheres
in the CSC-like cells, but did not affect phosphorylation of Plk1 and led to decreased
proliferation in non-CSCs. Our results showed that Plk1 and RSK1 play important roles
in the conversion of CSCs between active and quiescent states.

colony formation is often used to identify CSCs in human
brain tumors, melanomas, and glioblastomas [3, 12, 13], and
is also an efficient method to identify CSCs in gastric cancer
[5, 14]. Furthermore, CSCs can be enriched in spheres in
renal cell carcinoma and OSCC [15, 16]. CSCs provides us
with a framework for further understanding carcinogenesis
and for explaining the high failure rate of treatments and the
poor survival rate of gastric cancer patients.
Cell quiescence, which is a reversible nonproliferative state with decreased transcription and
translation levels and low metastasis, is an important
property of CSCs [17–19]. Evidence of CSC quiescence
has been found in breast cancer and acute myeloid
leukemia [20–22]. Similar to stem cells, which are able
to exit the quiescent state to differentiate and proliferate
in response to stress, quiescent leukemic stem cells enter
the cell cycle after chemotherapy [17]. More and more
evidence suggests that quiescence in CSCs is a crucial
mechanism for their chemoradiotherapy resistance and
survival, which in turn can eventually lead to cancer
relapse [23, 24]. Using a long-term PKH26-labeling
retention assay, quiescent stem cells were identified among

INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as “cells within
a tumor that possess the capacity for self-renewal and that
can cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that
constitute the tumor” [1]. They were first demonstrated in
acute myeloid leukemia by Dick and coworkers in 1997,
and were subsequently identified in a variety of cancers,
including brain, breast, and gastric cancers [2–5]. Based on
the expression of cell surface markers, such as CD44 and
CD133, CSCs have been isolated from gastric cancer cell
lines, lung tumor tissues, and other cancers [5–8]. Increasing
evidence reveals that CSCs are responsible not only for
tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis, but also for relapse.
Furthermore, several characteristics make them highly
resistant to traditional cancer therapies, including relatively
slow cycling, powerful DNA repair function, high expression
of drug transporters, and apoptosis resistance [9–10]. CSCs
from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) show increased
migration, invasion, and malignancy both in vitro and in vivo,
and expression of Nanog/Oct-4/CD133 is higher in OSCC
patients with the worst survival prognosis [11]. Spheroid

human normal mammary stem cells and in hepatocellular
carcinoma [21, 25], epithelial ovarian cancer, and other
cancers [26, 27]. However, knowledge of the mechanism
underlying CSC quiescence is limited. Therefore, greater
understanding of this mechanism is crucial for developing
novel CSC-targeted therapies to decrease treatment failure
rates and cancer relapse.
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine protein
kinase belonging to the human Polo-like kinase family
[28]. Due to the importance of Plk1 in cell proliferation, its
expression and activation are tightly regulated during the
cell cycle [29, 30]. However, Plk1 is highly overexpressed
in non-small cell lung cancer, human head and neck
cancer, and in patients with a poor prognosis, suggesting
that overexpression of Plk1 promotes carcinogenesis
and is closely associated with cancer aggression [31, 32].
Knockdown or depletion of Plk1 by RNA interference
inhibits tumor growth in nude mouse models [33]. Therefore,
Plk1 has drawn great attention and been regarded as a
potential anti-cancer target in cancer therapeutic research.
As an upstream regulator of Plk1, Aurora A (AURKA, also
known as STK6) activates Plk1 through phosphorylation of
a conserved threonine residue (Thr-210), and activation of
Plk1 is required for mitotic entry and progression [34, 35].
Plk1 inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinaseextracellular signal-regulated kinase-ribosomal S6 kinase 1
(MEK-ERK-RSK1) cascade in Artemia embryonic mitosis
and HeLa cells [36]. RSK1 promotes cell cycle progression
and cell proliferation in different stages of the cell cycle by
phosphorylating a variety of substrates implicated in cell
division [37, 38].
Recently, specific inhibitors of protein kinases in
Plk1 and RSK1 signaling pathways have been used to
study cell cycle regulation, including some which are
expected to be clinically used as anti-cancer agents. BI
2536 specifically inhibits Plk1 functions in mitosis, which
suppresses cell division and increases apoptosis in HeLa
cancer cells [39]. Inhibition of RSK1 using the specific
inhibitor SL0101 suppresses the proliferation of human
prostate cancer and breast cancer cells [40, 41]. However,
no data have been published concerning how CSCs are
regulated by Plk1 and RSK1 and their related inhibitors
and associated signaling pathways.
In the present study, we identified and isolated CSClike cells from the gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and
MKN74 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis of CD44 and an in vitro sphere formation assay,
and targeted quiescent CSC-like cells in spheres. We
found that Plk1 and other kinases involved in the MEKERK-RSK1 signaling cascade were all inactivated in the
quiescent CSC-like cells. Inhibition of Plk1 using specific
inhibitors suppressed the division of CSC-like cells, and
led to inactivation of the MEK-ERK-RSK1 pathway. In
addition, activation of Plk1 was significantly increased
in RSK1-inhibited CSC-like cells, suggesting that RSK1
inhibits Plk1 in the CSC-like cells. However, the situation
was different in the cancer cells: inhibition of Plk1

activated RSK1 via its upstream kinase MEK/ERK, and
Plk1 activity was not affected by RSK1 suppression.

RESULTS
Isolation and characterization of CSC-like cells
from the human gastric cancer cell lines
To isolate CSC-like cells, we analyzed the
expression pattern of CD44 by performing FACS of the
cell line MKN45. Based on the expression level of CD44,
two main populations were distinguished. The CD44hig
subpopulation accounted for 1% of the analyzed cells and
had the highest expression level of CD44. The CD44low
subpopulation accounted for 1% of the analyzed cells and
had the lowest expression level of CD44 (Figure 1A).
The CD44hig and CD44low subpopulations sorted from
MKN45 cells were cultured under non-adherent conditions in
serum-free medium containing EGF and bFGF. After 9 days
of incubation, cells in the CD44hig population proliferated
and generated small (immature) spherical colonies, whereas
there was no detectable sphere formation by CD44low cells
(Figure 1A). The spheres formed by CD44hig cells were
maintained in culture for 12 days and then disaggregated,
and the single cells obtained were cultured. After 7 days of
incubation, about 64.85±4.32% (n=3) of the cells produced
spheres, indicating a strong self-renewal ability (Figure 1B).
During the culture period, only spheres were collected for
passaging, and 54.34±5.83% (n=20) of cells disaggregated
from spheres were able to form spheres in every passage,
which were maintained for 20 passages.
CD44 high (CD44hig) and low expression (CD44low)
cells were also sorted from MKN74 cells and then cultured
in sphere-forming conditions for 10 days. 60.01±9.33%
(n=5) of the CD44hig MKN74 cells formed spheres,
while no spheres were found in the CD44low MKN74
cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). To further confirm the
CSC properties of the spheroid cells, western blot and
immunofluorescence analysis were performed to evaluate
the protein expression levels of CD44, CD133, epithelial
cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog,
which are key molecular markers to identify CSCs and
play major roles in stemness maintenance, transcription,
and nuclear reprogramming [5, 11, 14, 42–44]. Expression
not only of CD44 but of all the other markers, especially
CD133, Oct4 and Sox2, was much higher in spheroid cells
than in CD44low and unsorted cells (Figure 1C and 1D,
Supplementary Figure 1B).

Quiescent cells in spheres formed by CSC-like
cells and their resistance to treatments with
chemical drugs and radiation
To identify quiescent CSC-like cells in the spheres,
we performed a PKH26-labeling retention assay upon
CSC-like cell sphere formation. PKH26-labeled CSClike cells were plated, and the process of sphere formation

and concomitant PKH26-staining statuses were recorded
for 8 days. With continuous cell division and growth,
the intensity of red staining on the cell membrane was
gradually dispersed and reduced. After 4 days of culture, a
few cells in spheres remained brightly labeled with PKH26
stain, which displayed a much higher staining intensity
than in the other cells (Figure 2A and Supplementary
Figure 1C). Moreover, with the growth of spheres, PKH26
staining was sustained for 8 days. Therefore, we proposed
that these PKH26-retaining (PKH26+) CSC-like cells are
in a non-dividing and quiescent state.
To further confirm the quiescent state of PKH26+
CSC-like cells, the expression of the proliferation

markers Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) was investigated in PKH26+ and non-PKH26retaining (PKH26-) cells in MKN45 and MKN74 spheres
collected after 4 and 9 days of culture. Expression of
both Ki67 and PCNA was significantly decreased in
PKH26+cells (Figure 2B and 2C, Supplementary Figure
2A and 2B). These results indicated that PKH26+
CSC-like cells did not divide during sphere formation.
Therefore, only these few PKH26-retaining CSC-like
cells remained in a quiescent state in the spheres during
their proliferation.
In spheres, 85.1±7.75% (n=3) and 81.9±9.11%
(n=3) PKH26+ cells (red arrows) exhibited resistance

to the combined drug treatment of 1 mM 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) and 10 μM paclitaxel (TAXOL) and radiation
treatment (30 Gy) that are often used in clinical
therapies respectively, whereas 97.42±0.64% (n=3)
and 96.67±0.98% (n=3) PKH26- cells were sensitive
to these treatments and died, as determined by trypan
blue staining (Figure 2D). These results indicated
that CSC-like cells could maintain the quiescent state
without any loss of viability for prolonged periods and
resist chemoradiotherapy. Although a few PKH26- cells
(white arrows) survived with 2.57±0.64% (n=3) and
3.33±0.98% (n=3) after drug and radiation treatments
respectively (Figure 2D), we speculated that these
treatments could also induce some CSCs to enter the
quiescent state and thereby become resistant to the
treatments.

To study the regulation of CSC quiescence, we
collected cells disaggregated from spheres originated
from single PKH26-labeled MKN45 and MKN74 CSClike cells and examined the phosphorylation level of
Plk1 and RSK1 by immunofluorescence. The levels of
phosphorylation of Plk1 and RSK1 decreased in PKH26+
cells compared with the PKH26- cells (Figure 3A and 3B,
Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, the activation of
MEK and ERK was also inhibited in PKH26+ cells (Figure
3C and 3D, Supplementary Figure 3). These results
indicated that the activities of Plk1 and MEK/ERK/RSK1
were suppressed in the quiescent CSC-like cells.

To further examine the function of Plk1 in the
regulation of CSC-like cell quiescence, Plk1 was inhibited
by BI 2536 and BI 6727, two Plk1-specific inhibitors. CSClike cells were disaggregated from spheres and cultured
under non-adherent conditions in serum-free medium for
12 hours before treatment with these inhibitors. To confirm
that treatment with BI 2536 and BI 6727 inhibits activation

of Plk1 in MKN45 CSC-like cells and cancer cells, we
measured the phosphorylation of Myelin transcription factor
1 (Myt1), a Plk1 substrate. Western blot analysis showed that
Plk1 activity was successfully inhibited in MKN45 CSC-like
and cancer cells after BI 2536 and BI 6727 treatment (Figure
4A and 4B). Compared with control cells, only 2.58±0.41%
(n=3) and 2.28±0.38% (n=3) cells survived after 100 nM

BI 2536 and BI 6727 treatment for 48 hours, respectively
(Figure 4C and 4D). However, in the case of CSC-like cells,
the spheres did not form, but cells were quiescent after BI
2536 and BI 6727 treatments (Figure 4C and 4D). Moreover,
similar results were found in MKN74 cells (Supplementary
Figure 4A and 4B). CSC-like cell proliferation was
suppressed in the BI 2536-treated groups compared with the

control group, according to the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
assay (Figure 4E). These results indicated that inhibition of
Plk1 induced quiescence in MKN45 and MKN74 CSC-like
cells, but not in the cancer cells.
Next, we performed the CCK-8 assay to compare
the BI 2536 sensitivities of MKN45 CSC-like and
MKN45 cancer cells. Cancer cells were more sensitive

pathway

to BI 2536 at two different concentrations than CSC-like
cells. 33.4±6.34% (n=3) of cancer cells survived after BI
2536 treatment, while 92.63±8.24% (n=3) of CSC-like
cells survived at the same time point following treatment
of BI 2536 (Figure 4F). Moreover, BI 2536 and BI
6727-treated MKN45 and MKN74 cancer cells exhibited
significantly more severe apoptosis than the CSC-like cells
(Supplementary Figure 5). These results suggested that, in
contrast with the cancer cells, the CSC-like cells enter the
quiescent state in response to inhibition of Plk1.

In our previous study, we found that Plk1 inhibits the
MEK-ERK-RSK1 cascade during embryonic mitosis in
Artemia species, and in HeLa cells [36]. Here, the effect of
Plk1 inhibition on the MEK-ERK-RSK1 signaling pathway
in both MKN45 and MKN74 CSC-like and cancer cells was
examined. Consistent with our previous study in HeLa cells,

phosphorylation of RSK1 and its upstream kinase MEK/
ERK was significantly increased after Plk1 inhibition in
cancer cells (Figure 5A and 5B). However, western blot
analysis showed that the level of phosphorylation of RSK1
was significantly decreased after Plk1 inhibition in the CSClike cells (Figure 5C and 5D). Meanwhile, the activation
of MEK and ERK, upstream kinases of RSK1, was also
suppressed in Plk1-inhibited CSC-like cells (Figure 5C and
5D). Based on these results, MKN45 and MKN74 CSClike cells exhibited different regulation of RSK1 by Plk1
compared with the cancer cells.
As an upstream kinase of Plk1, Aurora A is
implicated in important processes during cell proliferation
[34, 35]. In this study, phosphorylation of Aurora A
was inhibited by MLN8054, an Aurora A-specific
inhibitor in CSC-like cells (Figure 5E). For CSC-like
cells, spheres were not observed in the Aurora-inhibited
groups in contrast with the control group (Figure 5F and
Supplementary Figure 6). Similar to the results observed

with Plk1 inhibitor treatment (Figure 5C and 5D), the
MEK-ERK-RSK1 signaling pathway was inhibited in
quiescent CSC-like cells upon treatment with MLN8054
(Figure 5E). These results indicated that Plk1 was
involved in regulation of CSC-like cell quiescence via
upstream Aurora A and the downstream MEK-ERK-RSK1
signaling pathway. Furthermore, the results confirmed that
the regulation of RSK1 by Plk1 differed between MKN45/
MKN74 CSC-like cells and cancer cells. Inhibition of
Plk1 induced overall suppression of the MEK-ERK-RSK1
signaling pathway in the CSC-like cells, but over-activated
ERK and RSK1 in the cancer cells.

Inhibition of RSK1 activates Plk1 in CSC-like
cells, but not in cancer cells
To determine how RSK1 regulates CSC-like cell
quiescence, activity of RSK1 was inhibited by SL0101
and LJI308, inhibitors of RSK1 (Figure 6A and 6B).

The results showed that inhibition of RSK1 by the
inhibitors had no effect on the formation of spheres by
MKN45 and MKN74 CSC-like cells (Figure 6C and
6D, Supplementary Figure 7). Furthermore, western
blot analysis showed that phosphorylation of Plk1 was
significantly increased in the CSC-like cells after SL0101
and LJI308 treatments, in contrast with the control (Figure
6A and 6B). However, unlike the results observed in
CSC-like cells, inhibition of RSK1 by SL0101/LJI308
had no effect on phosphorylation of Plk1 in MKN45 and
MKN74 cancer cells (Figure 6E and 6F). Compared with
control cells, the inhibitor reduced the proliferative rate of
MKN45 cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
6G). These results indicated that inhibition of RSK1
suppressed proliferation in the cancer cells, but not in the
CSC-like cells. Plk1 activity did not change in response to
inhibition of RSK1 in the cancer cells, but increased in the
CSC-like cells.
Based on these results, we propose two tentative
models for the involvement of Plk1 and RSK1 in
regulating sphere formation and cellular proliferation
in MKN45 and MKN74 cells (Figure 7). First, Aurora
A activates Plk1 to enable successful sphere formation
by the CSC-like cells and proliferation of the cancer
cells. Inactivaition of the Plk1 pathway induces
quiescence of CSC-like cells through suppression of
RSK1 by its upstream signal-regulated kinases MEK
and ERK. Conversely, inhibition of Plk1 in non-

CSCs activates RSK1 through MEK/ERK and results
in apoptosis and cell death. RSK1 activity, in turn,
influences the activation level of Plk1 through a negative
feedback mechanism in the CSC-like cells, but not in
non-CSCs.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that both Plk1 and
the MEK-ERK-RSK1 signaling pathway were silenced
in quiescent CSC-like cells, indicating their involvement
in the regulation of CSC quiescence. By treating MKN45
and MKN74 CSC-like cells with specific inhibitors of
Plk1, Aurora A and RSK1, we found that Plk1 plays an
important role in the activation of quiescent CSCs. Based
on our results, these inhibitors could suppress proliferation
and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, these
inhibitors did not similarly affect quiescent CSC-like
cells. Therefore, it is possible that quiescent CSCs could
survive and lead to cancer relapse after treatments with
these inhibitors and/or radiation.
Previous studies indicate that CSCs are more
resistant to cancer therapies than differentiated and rapidly
proliferating cancer cells. Breast CSCs were reported to
display intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy by Li and
coworkers [45]. Moreover, another group verified that
the increased radioresistance of breast CSCs was due to a
decreased level of reactive oxygen species in response to

radiation [46]. Resistance of CSCs to therapy has also
been found in several other cancer types, such as glioma,
colorectal cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia [47–49].
Here, we focused on the quiescence of CSCs, which is
believed to be essential for CSCs to maintain their selfrenewal capacity and resistance to chemotherapy. In
contrast with MKN45 cancer cells, quiescent CSC-like
cells in spheres were able to survive treatments with high
concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs and high-intensity
radiation (Figure 2D, red arrows). Additionally, a few active
CSC-like cells in spheres exhibited resistance to drugs and
radiation, similar to the quiescent CSC-like cells (Figure 2D,
white arrows). These results indicate that quiescent CSCs are
resistant to drugs and radiation, and, more importantly, that
some active CSCs could be induced to enter the quiescent
state upon drug and radiation treatments.
In our previous study of Artemia, we found that Plk1
and RSK1 are both inactivated in embryonic cells released
in the diapause phase (a state of obligate dormancy and
non-division), but are highly active in nauplius larvae,
in which cell division resumes [36]. Similar to quiescent
CSCs, diapause embryos are characterized by the
complete absence of cell division and DNA synthesis [50].
These results indicate that silencing of Plk1 and RSK1
plays important roles in inducing quiescence in both stem
cells and CSCs. However, silencing of Plk1 and RSK1 by
specific inhibitors induces apoptosis and death, in contrast
with stem cells from Artemia diapause embryos and
human CSC-like cells. These experiments imply that the
regulation of Plk1 and RSK1 in stem cells is different from
that in non-stem cells such as cancer cells. We propose that
silencing of Plk1 and RSK1 induces stem cells to enter the
quiescent state in response to severe environments such as
drug and radiation treatments.
Evidence, including the results in this report, showed
that SL0101 can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells
[40, 41]. However, more interestingly, inhibition of RSK1
by SL0101 and LJI308 had no effect on the proliferation
and sphere formation of MKN45 and MKN74 CSClike cells (Figure 6C and 6D, Supplementary Figure
7). Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that
phosphorylation of Plk1 was significantly increased in
the CSC-like cells after treatment with RSK1 inhibitors,
in contrast with the cancer cells (Figure 6A and 6B). Plk1
and RSK1 formed a regulatory feedback mechanism
in MKN45 and MKN74 CSC-like cells to help resist
the loss of RSK1 functions, which differed from the
mechanism in the cancer cells (Figure 7). Based on our
results, CSCs can enter the quiescent state in response to
unsuitable environments via the Plk1 and RSK1 signaling
pathway, but cancer cells cannot. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the differences in the regulation of
the Plk1 and RSK1 signaling pathway between CSCs and
cancer cells need to be elucidated.
In summary, inactivation of Plk1 induces quiescence
of gastric CSC-like cells by inhibiting RSK1 activity.

Importantly, regulation of Plk1 and RSK1 differed between
gastric CSC-like cells and the cancer cells. Our findings
may provide insights into the regulation of CSC quiescence,
and show that Plk1 and RSK1 play important roles in the
conversion of CSCs between active and quiescent states.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human gastric cancer cell lines MKN45
and MKN74 were purchased from Bioleaf Biotech.
The cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Corning)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO)
and antibiotics. CSC-like cells sorted from MKN45 and
MKN74 cells were cultured in ultra-low attachment plates
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium: F12 (Corning)
containing epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml), basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml), heparin sodium
(5 ng/ml), and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.

FACS analysis of the surface marker CD44 in
the gastric cancer cell lines
Cells were analyzed and sorted by FACS
according to a previously described method [5, 7]. Cells
were harvested using 0.25% trypsin and washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After centrifugation,
the cells were suspended in PBS containing 10 μg/
ml anti-CD44-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences) and
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated
for about 1 hour at 37°C and gently pipetted every
15 minutes. Stained cells were washed twice, and
resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml propidium
iodide, and then analyzed and sorted with a BD
FACSAriaII flow cytometer.

Spherical colony formation assay
FACS-sorted cells were plated in ultra-low
attachment 6-well plates in the same medium described
above at a density of 4000 live cells/well. The medium
was replaced every 3 days. After 1-2 weeks, each well was
examined using light microscopy and images of spherical
colonies were taken.

Immunofluorescence assay
Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight
and then washed with PBS. Fixed cells were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 prepared in PBS
for 10 minutes. The cells were washed and blocked in
antibody dilution buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.1%
Tween 20/Triton X-100 for 30–60 minutes. Thereafter,
the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies at
37642

Oncotarget

a dilution of 1:100 overnight at 4°C. The slides were
then washed twice with PBS and incubated with the
secondary FITC-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) in the
dark for 2 hours at room temperature. Cell nuclei were
stained with DAPI.

including anti-phospho-Plk1 (Abcam), anti-phospho
(Ser380)-RSK1 and anti-phospho (Ser221)-RSK1(Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-RSK (R&D Systems), antiMAPK (p44/42 MAPK) and anti-phospho-MAPK (Cell
Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-MEK1/2
(Epitomics). An anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma Aldrich)
was used as a loading control. Subsequently, appropriate
secondary antibodies were applied. The immunoreactive
bands were detected using a BM chemiluminescence
western blotting kit (Roche).

PKH26 labeling assay
Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and
labeled with PKH26 (Sigma Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 2×105 cells were
suspended in 200 μl of Diluent C and mixed with an equal
volume of Diluent C containing 0.2 μl of PKH26 dye. The
mixture was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature,
and then cells were washed with PBS three times. The
labeled cells were cultured in serum-free medium in ultralow attachment plates.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation and viability were assessed
using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime
Biotechnology) as described in the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells (2000 cells/well) were incubated in 96well plates in triplicate for 12 hours before drug (BI 2536
and SL0101) treatments. Viable cells were quantified by
measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nM with
a Multiskan EX plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Chemoresistance and radioresistance studies of
quiescent Csc-like cells
CSC-like cells were disaggregated from spheres and
labeled with PKH26 as described above. After about 10
days of culture in sphere-forming conditions, the resultant
spheres were treated with 1mM 5-FU and 10 μM TAXOL
(Sigma Aldrich) for 5 days. Viability was assessed by
trypan blue staining.
For radioresistance experiments, spheres generated
from PKH26-labeled CSC-like cells were irradiated
with 30 Gy (1.2 Gy/min) using a Rad Source 2000 (Rad
Source), and then the cells were cultured. The irradiated
spheres were observed for 3-4 days, and viable cells were
detected by trypan blue staining. Images of viable cells
were taken by light and fluorescence microscopy (Nikon,
ECLIPSE, TE2000-S).

Apoptosis detection
Apoptotic cells were detected using the TdTmediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
following the manufacturer’s instructions (DeadEnd™
Colorimetric TUNEL System, Promega). Cells were
treated with 50 nM BI 2536 and BI 6727 for 24 hours
and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for TUNEL detection.
Images of TUNEL-stained cells were recorded using light
microscopy. The proportion of TUNEL-stained cells was
calculated by counting cells in three individual views
randomly.
