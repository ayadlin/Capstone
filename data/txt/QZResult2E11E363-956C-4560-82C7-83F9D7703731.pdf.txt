Abstract
Among the regulators of angiogenesis, catecholamine neurotransmitters are of recent interest because of their opposite
roles in the regulation of tumor neovascularization. Norepinephrine and epinephrine by acting through specific adrenoceptors increase the synthesis of proangiogenic factors, and
thereby, promote tumor growth. In contrast, dopamine acting
via its specific D2 receptors inhibits tumor growth by
suppressing the actions of vascular permeability factor/
vascular endothelial growth factor-A on both tumor endothelial and bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells.
These reports identify novel endogenous regulators of tumor
angiogenesis and also indicate a new and an inexpensive class
of antiangiogenic drugs for the treatment of cancer. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(9):3727–30]

Introduction
Angiogenesis is essential for the development of the embryo,
tissue repair, and reproductive functions in the adult (1). This
process of new blood vessel formation is also critical for the growth
and progression of malignant tumors (1). The neovessels in these
tumors are mainly formed from the preexisting vessels by
proliferation and migration of the adult endothelial cells together
with the contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial
progenitor cells (EPC) (refs. 1–3). Although angiogenesis is an
intricately balanced phenomenon between the proangiogenic and
antiangiogenic factors in normal physiological processes, in
pathological conditions like cancer this regulatory balance is lost,
thereby leading to the formation of abnormal blood vessels with
increased permeability (1). It is now well established that
antiangiogenic therapy can retard the growth and progression of
malignant tumors (1, 4, 5). Accordingly, there is considerable
interest in identifying the antiangiogenic molecules and their
mechanism of actions so that newer therapies can be designed to
effectively target tumor angiogenesis and growth (1, 4, 5).
Among the several endogenous regulators of angiogenesis, the
roles of catecholamines (CA) are important due to their opposite
effects on tumor angiogenesis (6–10). Dopamine (DA) by acting
through its D2 receptors inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing the
action of vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth
factor-A (VPF/VEGF) on both adult endothelial cells and EPC (6, 7).

In contrast, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) by acting
through the h adrenoceptors up-regulate the synthesis of many
proangiogenic factors in the malignant tumor cells and induce
angiogenesis in the tumor tissues (8–10). The present review briefly
discusses the role of CAs on tumor angiogenesis and how they can
be utilized for the treatment of cancer.

Catecholamine Neurotransmitters
CAs are a major class of neurotransmitters synthesized from the
amino acid tyrosine (11, 12). Besides the brain in the central
nervous system, these compounds are endogenously produced in
the periphery at the sympathetic nerve endings, in chromaffin
tissues like adrenal medulla, in nonneuronal gut cells, and in
lymphocytes (11, 12). These neurotransmitters are also considered
to be the physiological regulators of flight or fight response during
stress and have both excitatory and inhibitory roles (12). NE and E
act on their respective target cells through a and h adrenoceptors
(12). These receptors are further subdivided into different subtypes;
the a1 adrenoceptors act by increasing the intracellular calcium
level, whereas the a2 adrenoceptors inhibit intracellular cyclic AMP
(cAMP) by down-regulating adenylate cyclase (12). The h1 and h2
adrenoceptors increase intracellular cAMP by activating adenylate
cyclase (12). However, DA acts on its target cells through its specific
receptors, which are broadly classified as D1 and D2 types (12). The
D1 class includes the D1 and D5 subtypes, which on activation
increase intracellular cAMP (12). In contrast, the D2 class of
receptors, which includes D2, D3, and D4 subtypes, inhibits
intracellular cAMP (12).

NE and E Up-regulates Tumor Angiogenesis
Although there are several studies that indicate chronic stress
mediates initiation and promotion of different types of experimental and human tumors, these studies suggest that the mechanisms
of stress-induced tumor growth are due to major alterations in
tumor immunity (13). Interestingly, recent reports have indicated
that substantial amounts of NE and E are produced during chronic
stress owing to the activation of sympathoadrenal medullary axis,
and these CAs act through the h adrenoceptors to directly
stimulate the growth of different types of malignant human tumors
by up-regulating the synthesis of proangiogenic factors like VPF/
VEGF (8–10, 14–16). It is important to mention here that among
the several proangiogenic factors, VPF/VEGF is the most critical
cytokine required for the induction of tumor angiogenesis, and the
action of VPF/VEGF is mediated mainly through its VEGFR-2
receptors present in the tumor endothelial cells (1, 4). There are
now several reports indicating that tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) play an important role in promoting tumor angiogenesis
by secreting proangiogenic growth factors and matrix metalloproteases (MMP) (refs. 17, 18). It has also been recently shown
that NE, by acting on the adrenoceptors present in the TAM,

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of norepinephrine- and dopamine-mediated signaling pathways in tumor cells, endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitor cells that
regulate tumor angiogenesis. A, norepinephrine acting through h adrenoceptors in ovarian carcinoma cells induces synthesis and release of proangiogenic molecules,
IL-6, and VEGF by these cells. B, dopamine acting through D2 receptors in tumor endothelial cells inhibits proliferation of these cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2, MAPK, and FAK. C, dopamine acting through D2 receptors decreases ERK1/ERK2-mediated MMP-9 release by endothelial progenitor cells and
thereby inhibits their mobilization from the bone marrow and thus prevents their participation in tumor neovascularization. hAR, hadrenergic receptor; EC, endothelial

stimulates production of MMP-9 by these cells and thereby,
induces angiogenesis in ovarian cancer (18).

Signaling Pathways in NE- and E-Mediated
Increased Tumor Angiogenesis
It has been shown that NE stimulates angiogenesis in human
malignant ovarian tumors (Hey-A8, SKOV3ip1) grown orthotopically in nude mice by acting through the h2 adrenoceptors present
in these tumor cells (8). The mechanism of this NE action has
been attributed to the increased VPF/VEGF synthesis (8, 9) and
over expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the cAMP-protein
kinase A (PKA) pathway (8). Thus, the underlying signaling
pathway to promote angiogenesis in these malignant ovarian
tumors can be summarized as h receptor!cAMP!PKA!VEGF.
A similar result has been shown in the human pharyngeal
carcinoma cell line HONE 1, in which NE by acting through h2
adrenoceptors stimulates synthesis of VPF/VEGF and matrix
metalloproteases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (10). Also, NE treatment
significantly increases VPF/VEGF synthesis in several human
multiple myeloma cell lines (NCI-H929, MM-M1, and FLAM-76)
by acting through h1 and h2 adrenoceptors present in these cells

(14). In addition to these signaling pathways, another proangiogenic molecule, IL-6 is also involved in NE- and E-mediated ovarian
cancer angiogenesis (15). Recent reports have shown increased
synthesis and release of IL-6 in human ovarian tumor cell lines
(SKOV3ip1, Hey-A8, and EG) following NE treatment in vitro (15). A
significant increase in IL-6 mRNA synthesis and its promoter
activity has been observed in these malignant ovarian cells
following NE treatment (15). Furthermore, abrogation of this effect
by h adrenoceptor antagonists confirms that NE regulates the
transcription of IL-6 gene through h adrenoceptors (15). In depth
elucidation of this signaling pathway also indicates Src kinase
phosphorylation following NE treatment, which subsequently leads
to increased IL-6 mRNA synthesis through enhanced IL-6 promoter
activity (15). This NE!h receptor!Src kinase!IL-6 pathway in
ovarian tumor cells corroborates well with the immunohistochemical analysis of human ovarian cancer tissues demonstrating strong
correlation between over expressed Src kinase and the degree of
tumor neovascularization (Fig. 1A) (ref. 15). Because activation of
Src also induces other proangiogenic molecules like VPF/VEGF and
IL-8, these CAs may be responsible for regulating the synthesis of
these proangiogenic molecules by ovarian cancer cells (15).
However, in a recent study, Landen and colleagues (16) have

shown that NE and E can induce MMPs in ovarian tumor cell lines
by activation of STAT3, a transcription factor known to initiate
several signaling pathways in cancer via IL-6 independent h1/h2
adrenoceptor!PKA signaling pathway.

Dopamine Down-regulates Tumor Angiogenesis
Recent reports from our laboratory have shown that DA is an
endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis (6, 19). However,
unlike NE and E, DA does not influence the expression of
proangiogenic molecules like VPF/VEGF in cancer, rather it acts
by down-regulating VEGFR-2-mediated signaling pathways in both
tumor endothelial cells and EPC through DA D2 receptors present
in these cells (6, 7, 19, 20). Accordingly, increased tumor
angiogenesis and tumor growth is observed in DA D2 receptor
knock out mice (7, 19). In addition, DA treatment also inhibits
tumor angiogenesis, growth, and increases the life span of mice
transplanted with human stomach, colon, and breast malignant
tumors (20, 21). These reports thus confirm that DA inhibits tumor
growth by suppressing angiogenesis (6, 7, 19–21).

Signaling Pathways in DA-Mediated Suppression of
Tumor Angiogenesis
In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that DA inhibits
VPF/VEGF-induced angiogenesis by suppressing VEGFR-2
phosphorylation in tumor endothelial cells (19–21). This DAmediated suppression of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation, in turn,
inhibits MAP kinase and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation
(Fig. 1B) (ref. 21). Furthermore, studies on DA D2 receptor knock
out mice also support these findings as increased tumor
angiogenesis and growth is associated with significantly increased
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in tumor endothelial cells collected from
these knock out animals (19).
In addition, a number of reports have shown the significance
of EPC in the formation of tumor neovessels (2, 3). In tumorbearing hosts, EPC are mobilized from the bone marrow niche by
VPF/VEGF through a series of molecular steps like activation of
MMP-9, which subsequently promote the mobility of EPC from the
bone marrow to the peripheral circulation by release of soluble kit
ligand (sKITL) (ref. 3). This is an important step required for the
mobilization of EPC into circulation and its subsequent incorporation into the tumor neovessels (3). Our recent investigation has
shown a new molecular pathway of this tumor-induced EPC
mobilization (7). Although a considerable amount of DA is present
in the bone marrow of normal animals, we have shown, for the first
time to our knowledge, that bone marrow DA is an important
regulator of the mobilization of EPC from the bone marrow during
tumor growth (7). It has been shown that the bone marrow DA is
significantly decreased in tumor-bearing mice, and this decrease is
associated with increased mobilization of EPC from the bone
marrow into peripheral circulation (7). The role of endogenous

bone marrow DA in the process of EPC mobilization is further
supported by increased EPC mobilization in tumor-bearing DA D2
receptor knock out mice (7). In addition, treatment of wild-type
tumor-bearing mice with exogenous DA significantly inhibits
mobilization of EPC, and DA acts through its D2 receptors present
in these progenitor cells (7). These results confirm the regulatory
role of DA in tumor angiogenesis, and the underlying molecular
mechanisms have been attributed to DA D2 receptor-mediated
inhibition of MMP-9 through down-regulation of ERK-1/ERK-2
signaling pathways in EPC (Fig. 1C) (ref. 7). Lastly, there is also a
report indicating decreased tumor angiogenesis and growth in rats
with high dopaminergic activity (22).

Conclusions and Future Directions
Taken together, the studies outlined above indicate that the CA
neurotransmitters are important regulators of tumor angiogenesis
(6–10, 13–16, 18–21). NE-mediated activation of h2 adrenoceptors
stimulates tumor angiogenesis (8–10, 13, 14, 16), whereas DAinduced activation of DA D2 receptors inhibits tumor angiogenesis
(6, 7, 19–21). It may, therefore, be suggested that these neurotransmitters are possibly acting as an angiogenic switch in the
tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, in pathological conditions,
in which changes in the expressions of these neurotransmitter
receptors occur, the intricate balance between the stimulatory and
inhibitory effects of these molecules on angiogenesis may be
altered leading to the rapid development of an undetectable tumor
mass, which subsequently grows and metastasizes. Accordingly,
further research on the specific roles of these neurotransmitters in
the development of human malignant tumors is necessary. It is to
be noted here that patients taking h blockers have less incidence of
cancer (23). Also, recent clinical trials have shown that DA D2
receptor agonists inhibit the actions of VPF/VEGF in ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome patients (24). These clinical reports are
very encouraging because both h blockers and DA D2 receptor
agonists are in clinical use at present for the treatment of other
diseases (23, 24). Therefore, future clinical trials may be undertaken
with these inexpensive drugs for the treatment of cancer and
other diseases in which angiogenesis play an important pathogenic
role (1).
