mTOR Inhibitor RAD001 Promotes Metastasis in a Rat Model
of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Cancer

Abstract
Inhibition of mTOR is commonly considered a valid target in cancer treatment, but this assertion does not
address effects on the immune microenvironment that may be detrimental to cancer treatment. Here we show
how administration of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) results in the occurrence of distant metastasis
in a rat model of pancreatic cancer. RAD001 was administered twice weekly for 4.5 weeks as a single treatment
or combined with [177Lu-DOTA,Tyr3]octreotate (177Lu-DOTATATE), where the latter targets the somatostatin
receptor-2. The hypothesized synergistic therapeutic effect of RAD001 combined with 177Lu-DOTATATE
was, however, not observed in our experiments. The combination was shown to be less effective than 177LuDOTATATE alone. Unexpectedly, tumor metastasis was observed in 77% of the subjects treated with RAD001,
either alone or as part of the combination treatment. This was a striking effect, because metastasis did not occur
in control or 177Lu-DOTATATE-treated animals, including those where the primary tumor was surgically
removed. These ﬁndings may be important clinically among noncompliant patients or patients that discontinue
RAD001 therapy because of adverse effects. Cancer Res; 73(1); 12–18. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEPNET)
are usually slow growing and most patients present with
already metastasized disease at time of diagnosis. As published
by Missiaglia and colleagues (1) in many pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), the mTOR signal transduction pathway is upregulated. This pathway plays a key role in regulating
cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Inhibition of the mTOR signal transduction pathway in PNETs by
RAD001 has shown promising results with a clinical beneﬁt of
76%, when given as a single treatment (n ¼ 115), and of 82%,
when given in combination with octreotide-LAR (n ¼ 45; ref. 2).
The RADIANT-3 study, a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multicenter phase III trial of 10 mg RAD001 daily in
PNET-patients (n ¼ 410) has been completed recently. Median
progression-free survival for RAD001 plus best supportive care
was 11 months compared with 4.6 months in the placebo
group (P < 0.001) with acceptable toxicity (3). Most recently, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved RAD001 for the
treatment of PNET patients.
From the late 1990s, clinical peptide receptor radionuclide
therapy (PRRT) studies have been carried out with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such as 177Lu-DOTATATE and

[90Y-DOTA,Tyr3]octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC; Onalta), targeting
sst2 overexpressed on most GEPNETs. These studies have
shown very promising results with regard to tumor response,
overall survival, and quality of life (4, 5).
Considering the promising results of both RAD001 and
PRRT for the treatment of GEPNETs, we combined these 2
therapies in the CA20948 syngeneic pancreatic tumor model in
the rat. This radiosensitive model is commonly used for
preclinical PRRT experiments and also shown to be susceptible
to RAD001 treatment (6). For comparison, studies were also
carried out in the xenograft H69 tumor model in nude mice.
The aim of the current study was to investigate the therapeutic
effects of combined treatment with RAD001 and 177LuDOTATATE compared with those of the 2 monotherapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The CA20948 rat pancreatic tumor cell line (derived from a
rat pancreas at our institution) is of acinar origin (7), has high
sst2 expression, and was cultured as reported previously (8, 11).
The cells were passaged for a maximum of 20 times and
checked for mycoplasma infection and sst2 expression every
3 months.
The H69 tumor cell line is a human small-cell lung carcinoma (the American Tissue Culture Collection, Wesel, Germany), has high sst2 expression, was passaged for a maximum
of 10 times, and was cultured according to the supplier's
protocol.
Tumor models
The animal studies were in agreement with the Animal
Welfare Committee requirements of our institution and

conducted in accordance with generally accepted guidelines.
For the ﬁrst 2 experiments, male Lewis rats (Harlan; Horst, the
Netherlands) with a mean body weight of 275 g were used. For
tumor induction, 107 CA20948 tumor cells in 0.5 mL ice-cold
PBS per animal were injected subcutaneously in the lower
ﬂank. Monitoring of body weight and tumor size by caliper
measurements was carried out by a technician blinded for the
treatment groups. Tumor volume was calculated according to
0.4  length  width  height. In the ﬁrst study (Fig. 1), animals
were euthanized when tumor size had reached a volume of
more than 4 cm3 or when a tumor was bleeding due to skin
penetration. In the second study, the primary subcutaneous
tumors were surgically removed when tumor volume exceeded
4 cm3 or when the tumor was bleeding due to skin penetration,
thus saving the animals for follow-up. Animals were euthanized when more than 10% loss of body weight was detected.
For the third experiment, 24 male NMRI Nu/Nu mice with a
mean body weight of 35 g xenotransplanted sst2-expressing
H69 cells were used. Animals were euthanized when tumor size
reached a volume of more than 2 cm3, when a tumor was

of 30 MBq 111InCl3/0.5 mg DTPA-octreotide was carried out as
previously described (10). For the mouse experiments, a speciﬁc
activity of 30 MBq 111InCl3/0.1 mg DTPA-octreotide was used.
In vitro autoradiography and hematoxylin and eosin
staining
These procedures were carried out as previously described
in detail (11).
Experimental setup
In experiment 1, RAD001 treatment was started 10 days after
tumor inoculation, followed by 177Lu-DOTATATE injection.
Animals were randomized into matching treatment groups
with regard to tumor size at the start of treatment. Six
treatment groups were created using 1 dose of RAD001
(5 mg/kg body weight twice a week) and 2 doses of
177
Lu-DOTATATE, 125 or 278 MBq, either as monotherapy or
in combination (Table 1). Experiment 1 ended at day 60. To
keep animal discomfort as low as possible and for practical
reasons, RAD001 was administered twice weekly.
Experiment 2 was essentially similar as experiment 1; variations were 2.5 next to 5 mg/kg body weight dose of RAD001,
alone or combined with 125 MBq 177Lu-DOTATATE (Table 1).
The most important difference in comparison with experiment 1
was the resection of the subcutaneous tumor when tumor size
increased to more than 4 cm3. Experiment 2 was terminated at
day 150. All animals still alive at the end of the experiment were
checked for distant metastases by 111In-DTPA-octreotide single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or computed tomography (CT) and autopsy.

In experiment 3, NMRI Nu/Nu mice bearing subcutaneous
H69 tumors were ﬁrst treated with 28 MBq 177Lu-DOTATATE
injected intraperitoneally. Four days later, 3 combination
treatment groups were created at random. The ﬁrst group
received RAD001 (5 mg/kg body weight) daily, the second
group received RAD001 (5 mg/kg body weight) twice a week
with placebo treatment daily for the rest of the week, and the
third group received placebo treatment daily. RAD001/placebo
treatment was given for a total of 4 weeks. Three weeks after
the ﬁrst 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment, a second 25 MBq
177
Lu-DOTATATE treatment was given to all animals as an
alternative for surgical removal of the primary tumor. When
subcutaneous tumor size exceeded 2 cm3, the animal was
checked for distant metastases by 111In-DTPA-octreotide
SPECT/CT and autopsy.
Surgical procedure
During all surgical procedures, isoﬂurane/O2 anesthesia was
applied and animals were kept warm using a heating pad. After
shaving and disinfection, an incision was made just adjacent to
the tumor. The capsule surrounding the tumor was carefully
dissected from the surrounding tissue. The wound was closed
by using absorbable sutures.
SPECT/CT scanning
After 24 (experiment 1) or 48 hours (experiment 2) of intravenous (i.v.) injection of 177Lu-DOTATATE, a helical SPECT scan
was acquired covering the tumor region using the 4-headed
NanoSPECT/CT system (Bioscan) using Nucline software
(v2.01, Mediso) for the quantiﬁcation of 177Lu-DOTATATE

response (12, 13). Boulay and colleagues also showed twice
weekly administration of RAD001 to be as effective as daily
administration in this tumor model (6). All animals in the
control and the RAD001-only group had to be euthanized
within 36 days after start of treatment because of tumor growth
beyond 4 cm3 or a ruptured tumor. As expected, all animals
receiving 177Lu-DOTATATE with or without RAD001 exhibited signiﬁcant antitumor response compared with controls
(P  0.05). However, 177Lu-DOTATATE in combination with
RAD001 did not show evidence of being more effective than

tumor uptake. Just before euthanizing an animal, a whole-body
SPECT/CT scan was carried out 4 to 24 hours after i.v. injection
of 111In-DTPA-octreotide for detection of distant metastasis.

Results and Discussion
Our ﬁrst study, described in Table 1 (groups 1 – 6), showed
inhibition of CA20948 tumor growth by RAD001 monotherapy as was previously found by Boulay and colleagues as
well (6). In addition, in clinical studies mTOR inhibition
generally seems to elicit a cytostatic, rather than a cytotoxic,

Lu-DOTATATE alone (Fig. 1A). A dose–effect relationship
for the low- and high-dose 177Lu-DOTATATE was not found,
which is in agreement with similar levels of 177Lu-DOTATATE
tumor uptake in these 2 groups 24 hours after injection, as
quantiﬁed on the basis of SPECT (Fig. 1E). Partial saturation of
the sst2 receptors on the tumor cells in the high-dose group
could play a role in this regard.
Strikingly, from day 40 after start of treatment, most animals
in the combination therapy groups showed unexpected
decrease in body weight (Fig. 1B). Tumor metastasis to the
liver and occasionally to the lung was found in these animals on
autopsy (Fig. 1D). In the combination treatment groups, 11 out
of 14 animals had to be euthanized because of loss of body
weight and apparent metastasis (Fig. 1C). Metastases could be
visualized after injection of 111In-DTPA-octreotide by SPECT/
CT, indicating sst2 expression. The 177Lu-DOTATATE-onlytreated animals did not show loss of body weight and were
all free of metastasis, as conﬁrmed by negative 111In-DTPAoctreotide SPECT/CT scans and negative autopsies (Fig. 1D).
The occurrence of spontaneous metastasis in the subcutaneous CA20948 tumor model has not been described previously,
despite the fact that this model has often been used in
PRRT studies with long follow-up periods (14). We, therefore,
hypothesize that RAD001, alone or in combination with
177
Lu-DOTATATE, or the discontinuation of RAD001 treatment might be the cause of the metastasis. Unfortunately, the
RAD001 monotherapy treatment group in this study did not
survive long enough to develop or to be tested for metastases
by SPECT.
For further investigation, a second study was carried out
(Table 1; groups 7–13) in which a subcutaneous tumor reaching a volume of 4 cm3 was surgically removed to allow
long-term follow-up. Furthermore, in this experiment also
a 2.5 mg/kg body weight dose of RAD001 was applied next to
the earlier-used 5 mg/kg body weight, combined with 125
MBq 177Lu-DOTATATE (Table 1). In an additional group
(group 13), 5 mg/kg body weight of RAD001 was given to
control rats without tumor.
The therapeutic effects obtained in this second study were in
agreement with the ﬁrst study, without signiﬁcant difference
with the use of the lower RAD001 dose. PRRT resulted in
complete response of the CA20948 tumor in 3 out of 7 animals,
whereas in all other animals the subcutaneous tumor had to be
removed surgically. In 1 animal treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE,
clear tumor spill into the wound bed was observed during the
surgical procedure, resulting in tumor regrowth in the wound
bed and metastasis in an ipsilateral lymph node in the groin.
Therefore, this animal was not included in our analysis. The
decrease in body weight seen in the RAD001 þ PRRT animals in
study 1 was less explicit in study 2 (Fig. 2B), probably because of
earlier intervention. Again, distant metastasis developed in
animals receiving RAD001, either in high or low dose, or
in combination with 177Lu-DOTATATE. (Fig. 2A), whereas
control and 177Lu-DOTATATE-treated animals remained
metastasis free. When development of distant metastasis
was suspected on the basis of loss of body weight,
111
In-DTPA-octreotide was injected and, 4 to 24 hours later,
a SPECT/CT scan (Fig. 3A) was acquired. When a distant

www.aacrjournals.org

metastasis could be visualized, the animal was euthanized,
followed by autopsy as illustrated by photographic images
(Fig. 3B). From the tumor tissue collected, frozen sections
were prepared and used for hematoxylin and eosin staining
(Fig. 3C and F) and 111In-DTPA-octreotide in vitro autoradiography with (Fig. 3E and H) or without (Fig. 3D and G) a
1000 excess of unlabeled octreotide (block). All metastasis
appeared to be sst2-positive, in agreement with the receptor
status of the primary subcutaneous tumors. In a third study,
RAD001 administered daily/twice weekly combined with
PRRT in a suboptimal dose did again not show any significant additional therapeutic effect on subcutaneous human
H69 xenografts in nude mice compared with placebo combined with PRRT (Fig. 2C þ D). In this experiment, no
distant metastasis was found after RAD001 therapy. A possible explanation could be the slow growth rate of the H69
tumor; longer follow-up and surgical removal of the primary
subcutaneous tumor as carried out in the rat experiment 2
was preferred, although this was not allowed according to
the animal ethical protocol for this study.
An explanation of the mechanism of action leading to the
unexpected metastases in lung, liver, and lymph nodes in
the rat model cannot be given on the basis of these studies.
Understanding the pathways involved and how they are
interconnected is needed to explain the current ﬁndings. As
recently discussed by Ebos and colleagues (15), sustained
suppression of the VEGF pathway may lead to a rebound in
tumor growth, after it is discontinued. Comparable with
our ﬁndings with RAD001, acceleration of metastasis was
found in preclinical models after short-term treatment with
the vascular endothelial/platelet derived growth factor
receptor (VEGFR/PDGFR) kinase inhibitor sunitinib (16).
The fact that, in our studies, RAD001 treatment was discontinued after 4.5 weeks may have resulted in such
rebound effect via VEGFR as well. The twice-weekly administration of RAD001 could also have resulted in an incomplete inhibition resulting in an (twice-weekly repeated)
upregulation of growth pathways. Discontinued mTOR
inhibition could also have stimulated glucose uptake, glycolysis, and de novo lipid biosynthesis, which are considered
hallmarks of cancer and cancer metastasis. A possible
explanation for the higher therapeutic effects found for
177
Lu-DOTATATE-only treatment compared with the combination treatment of RAD001 and 177Lu-DOTATATE could
be the fact that, in the combination treatment, the tumor
cell proliferation rate is decreased by RAD001, resulting in
decreased radiosensitivity. The acceleration of metastasis
could be caused by an effect on the immune system that
could be unique to this particular preclinical CA20948
tumor model. Therefore, comparable experiments with
other preclinical tumor models, such as the H69 mice
model with surgical removal of the primary subcutaneous
tumor, will have to be conducted. If the results of our
studies can be translated to humans, mTOR inhibition
treatment should be closely watched, especially after discontinuation of this therapy, because of adverse effects or in
noncompliant patients, despite the positive therapeutic
results of mTOR inhibition in different types of tumors.
