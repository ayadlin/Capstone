Abstract
It is widely accepted that complex interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding
microenvironment contribute to disease development, chemo-resistance and disease relapse. In
light of this observed interdependency, novel therapeutic interventions that target specific cancer
stroma cell lineages and their interactions are being sought. To this end, we studied a mouse model

of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and used intravital microscopy to
monitor the progression of disease within the bone marrow at both the tissue-wide and single cell
level over time, from bone marrow seeding to development/selection of chemo-resistance. We
observed highly dynamic cellular interactions and promiscuous distribution of leukaemia cells that
migrated across the bone marrow, without showing any preferential association with bone marrow
sub-compartments. Unexpectedly, this behaviour was maintained throughout disease development,
from the earliest bone marrow seeding to response and resistance to chemotherapy. Our results
reveal that T-ALL cells do not depend on specific bone marrow microenvironments for
propagation of disease, nor for the selection of chemo-resistant clones, suggesting a stochastic
mechanism underlies these processes. Yet, while T-ALL infiltration and progression are
independent of the stroma, accumulated disease burden leads to rapid, selective remodelling of the
endosteal space, resulting in a complete loss of mature osteoblastic cells whilst perivascular cells
are maintained. This outcome leads to a shift in the balance of endogenous bone marrow stroma,
towards a composition associated with less efficient haematopoietic stem cell function1. This
novel, dynamic analysis of T-ALL interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment in vivo,
supported by evidence from human T-ALL samples, highlights that future therapeutic
interventions should target the migration and promiscuous interactions of cancer cells with the
surrounding microenvironment, rather than specific bone marrow stroma, in order to combat the
invasion by and survival of chemo-resistant T-ALL cells.

The importance of cancer cell interactions with their surrounding microenvironment has
gained increased attention due to the hypothesis that specific supportive cells may regulate
quiescence, survival and self-renewal of cancer cells themselves. This relationship may
underlie a critical mechanism that facilitates both the initiation of disease and chemoresistance. Leukaemia develops within the bone marrow (BM), where it has been suggested
to take part in complex crosstalk that in some cases results in microenvironment
remodelling2–8. Therapeutic targeting of leukaemia-supportive niches has been
proposed9,10, therefore it is critical that we understand both the spatial and kinetic nature of
leukaemia-BM interactions. However, our current knowledge of leukaemia biology is
predominantly derived from ex vivo flow cytometric analysis, and static images that cannot
capture information on the location and dynamics of leukaemia interactions with BM
structures and cells over time.
We studied a Notch-driven mouse model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL),
which recapitulates human disease both phenotypically (Extended Data Fig. 1) and
genetically11,12. 25% paediatric and 40% adult T-ALL patients develop aggressive relapsed
disease originating from chemo-resistant clones13. Thus, there is a pressing need to
understand if T-ALL cells migrate to, and interact with particular BM stroma during the
propagation of disease and/or selection of chemo-resistance, or if T-ALL can remodel the
BM microenvironment in its favour.
To address these questions, we monitored leukaemia growth in mouse calvarium bone
marrow by intravital microscopy14–16. We used a tile-based imaging approach akin to
Google Earth that allows tissue-wide visualisation of heterogeneous BM microenvironments
(Fig. 1a, b) whilst maintaining resolution that permits measurement of single leukaemia cell

interactions with BM cells and structures by time-lapse microscopy15 (Fig. 1c and
Supplementary Video 1). To systematically characterise T-ALL interactions in vivo, we
injected transformed leukaemic cells isolated from primary hosts into secondary recipients,
and observed highly synchronous disease progression (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1). In
secondary recipients, T-ALL preferentially infiltrated the BM before expansion to peripheral
lymphoid organs (Extended Data Fig. 1). This is consistent with expression of CXCR4,
albeit at variable levels, on leukaemic cells (Extended Data Fig. 1). We visualised T-ALL
cells relative to osteoblasts (GFP or CFP positive in Col2.3-GFP/CFP reporter mice17,18),
perivascular mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (GFP positive in nestin-GFP reporter
mice19) and vasculature (by injecting Cy5 dextran) in cohorts of recipient mice during
disease progression and treatment (Fig. 1d).
By day 10 post-transplantation we could reproducibly observe single, sparse T-ALL cells in
the BM at a frequency of 1-30 cells per calvarium (Fig. 1e, f). We measured the proximity of
leukaemia cells to osteoblastic and nestin-GFP+ cells and vasculature. We used randomly
positioned dots as a control for the specificity of observed associations, as these do not
possess any inherent ability to localise to a particular BM stroma component (Fig. 1g). The
distribution of T-ALL cells was equivalent to that of the random dots and the actual
distances recorded inversely correlated with the abundance of each component (Fig. 1g-j).
These results demonstrate that seeding T-ALL in the BM is stochastically distributed relative
to osteoblasts, nestin-GFP+ cells and vasculature.

To determine whether T-ALL expansion was supported by specific constituents of the BM,
we monitored the dynamics of single T-ALL cells (Fig. 2a) for 3 hours (Fig. 2b, c, Extended
Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). This revealed that the vast majority of TALL cells were motile, in stark contrast with previous observations of transplanted
haematopoietic stem cells in BM15, and that movement was rarely restricted to the
proximity of any specific cell types or structures (Position 2 and 3 in Fig. 2b, c, and
Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). Notably, the speed of any given cell over time was also
heterogeneous, and thus no single migratory behaviour was associated with osteoblastic,
nestin-GFP+ cells or vasculature (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Videos 2
and 3). Tracking single T-ALL cells enabled us to measure the location of mitotic events,
revealing the same stochastic distribution of dividing cells and suggesting that proximity to
these stroma components is not key for T-ALL expansion (Fig. 2d, e, Extended Data Fig. 2,
Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). Additionally, daughter cells migrated large distances
following division, illustrating that clones and their progeny are not restricted to foci within
the local microenvironment (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Video 2, position 3). These
observations were consistent with tilescans performed at later stages of BM colonisation
(day 12-18 post transplantation), where we detected pockets of high and low infiltration
juxtaposed in all types of microenvironments (Extended Data Fig. 3 and 4). Interestingly, the
motility patterns displayed by single, isolated cells were also consistently observed when
tracking individual cells located in densely infiltrated areas (Supplementary Video 4).
Combined, these analyses demonstrate that T-ALL seeding and colonisation of BM do not
select for, or depend on specific BM stroma.

The question remained whether certain BM regions could create “hotspots” for chemoresistance through provision of a protective environment. To address this issue, we adapted
our imaging protocol to follow the same BM areas over multiple days to track leukaemia
dynamics from complete BM infiltration and throughout therapy. We used the lock-and-key
mechanism of the imaging window to precisely re-position mice on the microscope stage
over multiple imaging sessions. Mice were tilescanned 18 days post T-ALL transplantation
to confirm full BM infiltration. Dexamethasone was then administered daily (Fig. 3a), and
immediately after the third therapy dose we observed a staggering reduction in disease
burden20 (Fig. 3b-d and Extended Data Fig. 5a-b), while non-leukaemic, dexamethasonetreated control mice maintained robust BM and stroma cellularity (Extended Data Fig. 5d-e).
Strikingly, surviving cells were scattered throughout the BM space and not preferentially
associated with osteoblastic, nestin-GFP+ cells or vasculature compared to simulated data
(Fig. 3b-f, Extended Data Fig 5a-c).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To test whether initial T-ALL loss was independent from specific stroma components, we
increased the imaging temporal resolution to include the first day of treatment. The
distribution of T-ALL cells was maintained as disease gradually succumbed to therapy
(Extended Data Fig. 6). In contrast to predictions based on previous publications3,9,10,
time-lapse imaging immediately after administration of the third dose of dexamethasone
demonstrated that single surviving cells were highly migratory and did not maintain longlasting associations with osteoblastic (Fig 3g, h and Supplementary Video 5) or nestin-GFP+
cells (Supplementary Video 6). Furthermore, surviving cells travelled at significantly faster
speeds than early infiltrating cells (days 10-15) (Fig. 3m). Finally, residual T-ALL cells were
still capable of undergoing division (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Videos 5 and 6) at times when
other cells within the same mouse were still undergoing death (Supplementary Video 6).
This behaviour, coupled with the observation that mice maintained on dexamethasone for a
7-day period harbored an almost completely repopulated BM space (Extended Data Fig. 7a),
suggests these cells were genuinely resistant to dexamethasone.
Collectively, these data oppose the prevailing hypothesis that therapy-resistant leukaemic
cells depend on a particular microenvironment for survival. To investigate this proposed
paradigm, we compared the gene expression profile of T-ALL cells purified at full
infiltration to those isolated from mice 7-10 days after initiation of dexamethasone
treatment, when surviving cells have re-colonised the BM (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Gene
expression profiles of all T-ALL samples were more heterogeneous compared to control T
cells (CD4+ and CD8+), T cell progenitor (CD4+CD8+ thymocytes) and whole BM
populations as expected based on inter-clone variation in leukaemia cells21. The
transcriptome of resistant cells overlapped with that of T-ALL cells pre-treatment (Extended
Data Fig. 7c). Indeed, only 79 genes were differentially expressed in the post-treatment
group and, consistent with our intravital imaging data, none of the differentially expressed
genes were related to known cell-niche interaction candidates (Supplementary Table 1 and
Extended Data Fig. 7b). Together, our imaging and gene expression data suggest that
dexamethasone treatment does not select for a subpopulation of T-ALL cells that have been
directed to a specific niche.

To investigate the significance of these data in a human context, we assessed the migratory
behaviour of xenotransplanted primary human T-ALL (Supplementary Table 2) in NOD/
SCID/γ mice. Following dexamethasone treatment, even human wild-type Notch receptor TALL cells exhibited migratory behaviour equivalent to murine cells (Extended Data Fig. 8ad and Supplementary Video 7). We noted an even distribution of quiescent cells throughout
the BM as measured by Ki-67 staining (Extended Data Fig. 8e-f). To test whether the
migratory behaviour was a specific trait induced by dexamethasone, we treated murine TALL burdened animals with vincristine. The T-ALL response followed similar kinetics to
that of dexamethasone-treated animals. Enhanced migration of resistant cells and cell
division events were evident immediately after the third dose of vincristine (Figure 3i, j, m
and Supplementary Video 8). This behaviour was even more pronounced when we combined
dexamethasone, vincristine and L-asparaginase (Fig. 3k-m, Extended Data Fig. 9 and
Supplementary video 9). In this context, we observed the highest migration speed of all
therapies tested, despite over 50% of surviving cells being in G0 (Figure 3n, o),
demonstrating quiescence is not a feature of niche-restricted immotile cells following
chemotherapy. These findings were universal in all therapies tested in our studies, suggesting
migration and lack of long-lasting interactions with the surrounding microenvironment are
conserved features of chemo-resistance in T-ALL.

To assay whether T-ALL may affect BM structures, we performed time-lapse imaging in
heavily disease-burdened, untreated mice. After day 18 we observed striking remodelling of
osteoblasts (Fig. 4a, b). A 9-hour period of time-lapse imaging after full infiltration (day 19
onwards) revealed that osteoblastic cells underwent dramatic shrinking and blebbing (Fig. 4a
and Supplementary Video 10), in stark contrast to early stages of disease (Supplementary
Video 1) and to control Col2.3-GFP mice reconstituted with red fluorescent healthy BM
(Fig. 4a, b, Extended Data Fig. 10a, b and Supplementary Video 10). TUNEL and cleaved
caspase-3 histological stainings indicated osteoblasts were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 4c).
The loss of osteoblasts was so dramatic that virtually no GFP+ osteoblasts remained
apparent by days 22-25 post transplantation (Fig. 4b, d). Similar results were also found for
osterix+ osteo-progenitors (Fig. 4f), however, nestin-GFP+ cells were maintained (Fig. 4e
and Extended Data Fig. 10c, d), and blood vessels could still be visualised (Extended Data
Fig. 10e). Importantly, these findings were consistent in analyses performed using human TALL samples (Supplementary Table 2). We observed a significant reduction in osterix+
osteo-progenitors in NOD/SCID/γ recipient mice xenotransplanted with human T-ALL
samples (Fig. 4f). Additionally, histological analysis of BM trephine biopsies from T-ALL
patients with greater than 75% infiltration demonstrated an almost complete loss of
osteoblasts (Fig. 4g).
In summary, we demonstrate T-ALL infiltrates the BM and survives chemotherapy
independently of stable interactions with specific microenvironments. However, T-ALL has
a profound effect on osteoblastic cells. Our results suggest that to avoid the development of
chemo-resistance, novel therapeutic interventions may not need to target specific BM stroma
components, but rather the ability of T-ALL cells to interact with and migrate through the
BM. Our studies also reveal that T-ALL has the intrinsic potential to remodel the BM
microenvironment via apoptosis throughout the osteolineage. As these cells are associated
with haematopoietic fitness14,22,23, including in the context of leukaemia1,2,24, the

remodelling we uncovered may contribute to the loss of healthy haematopoiesis observed in
leukaemia patients1,2. Collectively, our observations suggest that a shift in therapeutic
design may be advisable, such that any intervention targeting osteoblastic cells should focus
on promoting survival of this lineage, rather than seeking to modulate a direct influence of
the BM on the cancer itself. Therefore, a better focus for novel anti-cancer therapeutics may
be on disrupting the ability of T-ALL cells to interact transiently with multiple components
of the BM microenvironment.

Mice
All animal experimentation in this study was approved and performed according to the
standards of the animal ethics committee at Imperial College London, UK and to UK home
office regulations (ASPA 1986). C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Harlan UK Ltd;
Col2.3-GFP, Col2.3-CFP18, Nestin-GFP and mTmG26 mice were bred and housed at
Imperial College London, UK. For imaging experiments, female Col2.3-GFP and NestinGFP mice >8 weeks old were used. Osterix-CreGFP mice were provided by A. McMahon
and backcrossed over 8 generations into NSG mice and maintained at the Francis Crick
Institute, Cancer Research UK27. Equal proportions of male and female Osterix-CreGFP

Generation of murine T-ALL disease

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

T-ALL was generated as previously described in28. Briefly, timed matings were established
between C57/Bl6 mice and embryos harvested at day E14.5. Single cell suspensions were
prepared from whole foetal livers isolated from the embryos. Suspensions were cultured in
IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor conditioned media with 20% FCS for 3 days. Lin-xE cells
were transfected by calcium phosphate with MigR1 plasmids containing either DsRed only
or DsRed with NotchICNΔRamΔP as originally described in29. We also used GFP tagged
plasmids when required. Supernatants containing recombinant retrovirus were removed and
spun by centrifugation onto non-tissue culture treated plates coated with 15ug/ml retronectin
(Takara Clontech, CA). Foetal liver cells were cultured in the presence of virus for 3 days
and transduction assessed by flow cytometry. Primary lethally irradiated recipient mice (two
doses of 5.5Gy administered greater than three hours apart) were transplanted with 1x106
DsRed+ve foetal liver cells by intravenous injection into the tail vein. Recipient mice were
maintained on baytril treated water to prevent infection for >6 weeks post transplantation.
Cohorts of reconstituted mice were the result of 3 independent foetal liver isolations and 3
independent transfections. Transformation of Notch-transduced non-malignant cells is
highly heterogeneous in vivo, with onset of primary disease ranging from 6-25 weeks29
(Extended Data Fig. 1). >4 weeks post reconstitution, peripheral blood was isolated from
mice, red blood cells were lysed, and successful reconstitution determined by presence of
DsRed+ cells. Mice reconstituted with NotchICNΔRamΔP transduced foetal livers were
monitored daily for signs of leukaemia onset or other signs of ill health. Mice were
euthanized when any one, or combination of the following signs were observed: hunched
posture, laboured breathing, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen, peripheral
white blood cell cellularity of 13 x109/L or greater. No experiment exceeded the tumour

burden approved by the Home Office and Imperial College ethics committee. Peripheral
lymphoid organs were analysed by flow cytometry for DsRed or GFP, CXCR4, CD3, CD4
and CD8 expression. All FACS data was collected on a Fortessa flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, CA). Secondary recipients were sub-lethally irradiated (two doses of 3Gy
administered greater than three hours apart) and injected with 10,000 thawed, Ficoll purified
T-ALL blasts and monitored as described above. In selected cases 10,000 secondary T-ALL
cells were transplanted into tertiary recipients. For therapy experiments, mice were injected
I.V daily with 15mg/kg dexamethasone sodium phosphate30,31 (Sellekchem, MA) alone,
0.15mg/kg vincristine sulfate salt (Sigma) alone or with a combination of 15mg/kg
dexamethasone, 0.15mg/kg vincristine and 1,000 IU/kg L-asparaginase (medac; obtained
from the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Pharmacy).
Bone marrow chimaeras
Reconstitution with MigR1 DsRed transduced cells yields <50% chimerism. For this reason,
analysis of healthy BM cells by microscopy is inaccurate. Therefore, to obtain >95%
chimerism of healthy, red fluorescent BM to be used for imaging control experiments, whole
BM mononuclear cells were isolated from femurs, hips and tibia of mTmG donor mice,
suspended in phosphate balanced salt solution and administered intravenously to recipient
mice at a dose of 2x106 cells/mouse. Recipient Col2.3-GFP or C57Bl/6 mice had been
lethally irradiated (two doses of 5.5Gy irradiation greater than 3 hours apart) immediately
prior to the transplant, and were maintained on baytril treated water to prevent infection >6
weeks post transplantation.
Intravital microscopy

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Intravital microscopy was performed using a Leica SP5 and a Zeiss LSM 780 upright
confocal microscope with a motorised stage. The SP5 was fitted with the following lasers:
Argon, 546, 633 and a tunable infrared multiphoton laser (Spectraphysics Mai Tai
690-1020). The Zeiss LSM 780 was fitted with the following lasers: Argon, 561, 633 and a
tunable infrared multiphoton laser (Spectraphysics Mai Tai DeepSee 690-1040). Signal was
visualised with a Leica HCX IRAPO L 25x water immersion lens (0.95 N.A) and a W PlanApochromat 20x DIC water immersion lens (1.0 N.A). Collagen bone second harmonic
generation signal and GFP signal were generated through excitation at 840 nm and detected
with external detectors. Internal detectors were used to collect DsRed and Cy5 signal (and
on some occasions, GFP). Prior to surgery, mice were administered analgesia with
buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg I.P). Anaesthesia was induced in mice with 4% isoflurane mixed
with pure oxygen. This was gradually reduced to approximately 1% as anaesthesia
stabilised. Surgery to attach the headpiece was then performed as described in16. Large 3
dimensional ‘tilescans’ of the entire BM cavity space were acquired by stitching adjacent,
high-resolution Z-stack images using a surgically implanted imaging window that ensures
steady positioning of mice on the microscope. The calvarium has been demonstrated to be
equivalent to the long bones such as the femur with regards to haematopoietic stem cell
frequency, function and localisation14,22, and is the only bone marrow compartment that
allows longitudinal imaging through minimally invasive surgery16,32. Blood vessels were
highlighted by I.V. injection of 50μl of 8μg/ml 500kD Cy5-Dextran (Nanocs, MA). Cy5
Dextran was re-injected every one-two hours to maintain blood vessel signal and cross

reference for registration of blood vessel data in time-lapse analysis. For repeated imaging,
protective intrasite gel (Smith & Nephew, UK) was applied to the imaging window to
preserve the bone integrity and prevent scar formation. The window was bandaged, and mice
were allowed to recover from anaesthesia. Due to the lock-and-key mechanism of the
imaging window16, mice could then be re-anaesthetised and accurately repositioned on the
microscope stage and the same BM areas re-imaged. After each imaging, analgesia was
administered via oral buprenorphine in raspberry jelly at a dose of approximately 0.8mg/kg.
Image quantification
Microscopy data was processed using multiple platforms. Tilescans were stitched using
Leica Application Systems (LAS, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and ZEN black (Zeiss,
Germany) softwares. Raw data was visualised and processed using Fiji/Image J. Simulated
data was prepared using FIJI macro to create, and overlay z-stack images on original tilescan
data. Using the internal random number algorithm, spheres matching the size of T-ALL cells
(11-15μm) were placed at random x,y,z co-ordinates. Simulated data FIJI macro is available
on request. Automated cell segmentation, distance and volume measurements were
performed in Definiens (Definiens Developer 64, Germany) using local heterogeneity
segmentation25 to isolate osteoblast and Nestin cells as well as vasculature, and a
combination of seed detection algorithm and morphological growing and shrinking
operations to detect leukaemia cells. Definiens rulesets for these functions are available upon
request. Distance measurements from this segmentation were performed as described in25.
Cell tracking was performed using Imaris (Bitplane, Switzerland) and the FIJI plugin
MTrackJ. For accuracy in cell tracking data, videos were registered when required before
using 4D data protocols implemented in Fiji33. 3D data rendering and measurement of cell
division distances were performed in Volocity (Perkin Elmer, MA) and Definiens (Definiens
Developer 64, Germany).

Microarrays
T-ALL samples were harvested from bone marrow and FACS sorted based on fluorescent
protein expression (DsRed or GFP) unless infiltration of bone marrow was complete.
Control samples for microarray were prepared by FACS sorting for splenic CD4+ T cells,
CD8+ T cells and CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from 8-14 week female C57Bl/6 mice. RNA was
purified from samples using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Netherlands) as per the
manufactures instructions. Purified RNA was prepared for hybridisation using the
Genechip® WT Plus reagent kit (Affymetrix, CA, USA) as per the manufactures
instructions and hybridised with genechip® Mouse gene 2.0 ST array (Affymetrix, CA,
USA) by the MRC Genomics facility (Imperial college London, UK). Analysis was
performed using R version 3.1.1. Data was normalised and summarised to “core” level using
the RMA method from the oligo package (version 1.30.0)34. Annotation was downloaded
from the Affymetrix NetAffx Query website. Differential expression was determined using
limma version 3.22.735. Genes with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and
absolute log-fold-change > 1 were deemed significant. Heatmaps of gene expression were
generated with pheatmap package version 1.0.2. Gene expression data are available on
ArrayExpress (accession number E-MTAB-4889).

Primary human T-ALL samples were obtained from the Barts Hospital (London, UK) after
informed consent via a protocol approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee
and carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration (see
Supplementary Table 2 for details), prior to treatment being administered to the patients.
Primary cells from two distinct patients were immunophenotyped, and CD45+/CD7+/

SCID/γ recipient mice. Primary xenograft transplantation was assessed via peripheral blood
sampling and/or bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow and spleen-derived primary
xenografts were infused I.V. in non-conditioned NOD/SCID/γ secondary recipient mice for
therapy experiments. Intravital imaging was performed as described above. Human T-ALL
cells were labelled by injecting 10 μg of PE-conjugated human CD45 antibody (clone HI30,
Biolegend) 15-30 minutes prior to the imaging session. For dexamethasone therapy
experiments, mice were treated with daily injections of 15mg/kg I.V31. Number of human
T-ALL cells in therapy experiments was quantified using reference beads as described in36.

Hips and tibias were harvested and post-fixed overnight in periodate-lysineparaformaldehyde fixative, at 4ºC. Bones were then washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer,
cryoprotected in sucrose (10-30% gradient), for 48h, frozen in optimal cutting temperature
compound (TissueTek) and stored at -80ºC. Sections were cut in a Leica Cryostat, using the
Cryojane tape transfer system (Leica microsystems) and stored at -80ºC. For staining, slides
were re-hydrated in PBS, permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% goat serum
and incubated with primary antibodies overnight, at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, slides were
incubated with secondary antibodies, counter-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI, Invitrogen), washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted using Prolong Diamond
antifade (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 647 mouse antiKi-67 (B56, BD Biosciences, 1:50), PE-conjugated human CD45 antibody (HI30, BD
Biosciences, 1:100), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling, 1:100), goat
anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 633 (Life Technologies, 1:400). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) labelling was performed to detect apoptotic
cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL System,
Promega). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 780 upright confocal/two-photon

Bone marrow from human T-ALL xenotransplanted, untreated and treated mice was
harvested and stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and FITC mouse anti-Ki-67 set (BD
Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were analysed by FACS
and absolute numbers were obtained using reference beads as described in36.

T-ALL engraftment and infiltration was confirmed via peripheral blood sampling and/or
tibia puncture. Once mice presented with signs of ill health (as described earlier), mice were
euthanized and bones digested with a DNAse I/Collagenase (Sigma) solution. The total
number of Osx/GFP+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis using counting beads
(CountBright, Life Technologies).
Human trephine histology
Samples were obtained from patients after informed consent had been obtained, under full
ethical approval by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Human Research Ethics Committee.
De-waxed human trephine biopsy sections (3μM) were stained with osteocalcin antibody
(Abcam ab93876, Cambridge, UK), counterstained and mounted for viewing. All areas of
each section were monitored for visible osteoblasts.
Statistics
The sample size required for the experiments was estimated based of the results of
preliminary data. Blinding or randomisation for animal experiments were not necessary due
to the nature of the experiments. Statistical differences between the means of two data
groups was determined by using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, and p values <0.05
were considered significant. Multiple group comparisons were performed using ANOVA
with a Bonferroni correction, p values <0.05 were considered significant.

Extended Data Figure 1. T-ALL disease experimental model.

Foetal liver single cell suspensions were isolated from E14.5 wild type embryos and
transduced with DsRed alone or DsRed with NotchICNΔRamΔP then transplanted into
primary lethally irradiated recipient mice. Recipient mice typically accumulated CD4+CD8+
cells in the peripheral blood from 4 weeks post transplant. Transformed leukaemic cells
could be distinguished from non-malignant cells based on DsRed expression levels, where
DsREDlo cells were transduced with the Notch construct yet were non malignant as they had
not yet acquired secondary mutations to drive leukaemogenesis, whereas DsRedhi cells were
fully malignant. DsRedlo cells contained single positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations,
whereas DsRedhi cells had predominantly the leukaemic CD4+CD8+ phenotype. The
accumulation of transformed leukaemic populations displayed large variation over time as
shown in the ratio of transformed to non-malignant cells in peripheral blood of primary
recipient mice at 6 and 9 weeks. When DsRedhi cells dominated peripheral cell populations,
mice were burdened with typical CD4+CD8+ T-ALL (now simply referred to as DsRed+).
When primary recipient mice displayed enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen, they were
euthanized and DsRed+ cells were harvested, stored frozen and transplanted into secondary
recipients. CXCR4 expression was measured in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and T-ALL by
flow cytometry (T-ALL from four primary donors) and microarray gene expression analysis

(triplicate biological replicates are shown for control T cells, and samples from nine
individual secondary recipients injected with 5 independent primary T-ALL samples). To
track disease progression, 10,000 primary T-ALL cells were transplanted into cohorts of
sub-lethally irradiated secondary recipient mice. Secondary transplanted cells colonized the
bone marrow primarily, before spreading to peripheral organs and blood (n = 4 mice per
time point) and developed disease more rapidly and synchronously than primary recipients
as injected cells were already transformed. Secondary recipients survived for up to 38 days
(shown are survival data of mice injected with 4 independent primary T-ALL samples [●,
❑, * and Δ], n = 2 mice per primary sample). In selected cases, secondary T-ALL blasts
were transplanted into tertiary recipients, which developed disease more rapidly but showed
similar responses to chemotherapy. The primary samples used in this study were from
primary recipients 151, 907, B2M2, B2M3, B2M10, B3M3 and B3M30. This nomenclature
refers to the mouse numbering from three independent foetal liver transductions. 1st
transduction: mouse 151 and 907, 2nd transduction (B2): mouse 2, 3 and 10; 3rd transduction
(B3): mouse 3 and mouse 30.

Figure 2. Four-dimensional imaging of leukaemia interactions in BM.

(a) Maximum projection tilescan of a Col2.3-GFP recipient mouse 12 days post-transplant
of T-ALL cells. (b) Individual positions (framed in a) were imaged at three-minute intervals
for three hours. Red: T-ALL cells; green: osteoblasts; blue: vasculature; grey: bone; arrows:
mitosis. (c) 3D cell tracks (temporally colour-coded) of individual leukaemia cells. Grey:
vasculature; green: osteoblasts; red spheres: T-ALL cells at beginning of imaging period; *:
finishing position of daughter cells; arrows: mitosis. (d, e) Position of mitosis relative to (d)
GFP+ osteoblasts (n = 46) or (e) nestin cells (n = 30) compared to randomly generated dots
(n = 48 and 28 respectively). Data in a-d are representative of/pooled from eight mice
(biological replicates) injected with T-ALL isolated from three primary donors. Data in e are
pooled from four individual mice (biological replicates) injected with T-ALL from two
primary donors. Error bars: mean±SEM.
