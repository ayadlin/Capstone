ABSTRACT
BCL6B is a potential tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer, but the regulation
and mechanism of BCL6B in human hepatocellular carcinogenesis remain unclear.
This study is to explore the epigenetic change and mechanism of BCL6B in human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nineteen hepatic cancer cell lines, 50 cases of
adjacent tissue and 149 cases of HCC samples were employed. BCL6B is methylated
in 100% (19/19) of human HCC cell lines, 40.0% (20/50) of adjacent tissue samples
and 86.6% (129/149) of primary cancer samples. Methylation of BCL6B is associated
with HBV positive (p < 0.05). But no association was found with age, sex, tumor
size, differentiation, TNM stage, recurrence and survival. Loss of BCL6B expression
was found in 19 of completely methylated HCC cell lines. BCL6B was re-expressed
after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment. Restoration of BCL6B expression suppressed
cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and G1/S arrest in HCC cells. The expression of
EGR1, a key component of p53 signaling, was increased after re-expression BCL6B in
HCC cells. Re-expression of BCL6B activated p53 signaling and sensitized HCC cells
to 5-fluorouracil. BCL6B is frequently methylated in human HCC and the expression
of BCL6B is regulated by promoter region hypermethylation. BCL6B activates p53
signaling by increasing EGR1 expression in HCC.

located on chromosome 17p13.1, a region of 800 bp next
to p53 gene. BCL6B was regarded as a potential tumor
suppressor and methylation of BCL6B may serve as a poor
prognosis marker in gastric cancer [10–12]. In this study,
we analyzed the epigenetic changes and the mechanism of
BCL6B in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth
most malignant cancer and the third leading cause of
cancer-related death worldwide [1, 2]. Even through
improved interventional and surgical treatment, The
5-year survival rate is less than 15%. The major reason
is cancer recurrence and metastasis [3–5]. Emerging
evidence indicates that epigenetic alterations, particularly
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or tumor-related
genes via promoter region hypermethylation, play an
important role in the development and progression of HCC
[6–9]. B cell CLL/lymphoma 6 member B (BCL6B) is
a homologue of B cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6). It is

cells (Figure 1A). The promoter region methylation was
detected by MSP. MSP primers were designed around
transcription start site in the CpG island of BCL6B gene
promoter region. Complete methylation was found in
HepG2, SNU449, PLC/PRF/5, SK-Hep1, SMMC-7721,
HBXF344, LAM3, SNU182, SNU387, SNU475, Hep3B,
Bel-7402, QSG7701, QGY-7703, BEL-7404, BEL7405, MHCC97H, Huh7 and Huh1 cells (Figure 1B). To
further validate MSP results and the density of promoter
region methylation, bisulfite sequencing was performed
in HepG2, SNU449, Bel-7402 and HBXF344 cells. As
shown in Figure 1C, MSP results are correlated with
bisulfite sequencing results very well. HepG2, SNU449,
Bel-7402 and HBXF344 cells are densely methylated.
These results suggest that BCL6B expression is correlated
with methylation status in HCC cells. To further validate
the expression of BCL6B is regulated by promoter
region hypermethylation, 5-Aza, a DNA methylation
transferase inhibitor, was applied in these HCC cells.
Re-expression of BCL6B was found  in  HepG2,
SNU449, PLC/PRF/5, SK-Hep1, SMMC-7721,
HBXF344, LAM3, SNU182, SNU387, SNU475, Hep3B,
Bel-7402, QSG7701, QGY-7703, BEL-7404, BEL7405, MHCC97H, Huh7 and Huh1 cells (Figure 1A).
These results further suggest that BCL6B expression was
regulated by promoter region methylation in HCC.

cancer tissue compared with adjacent tissue samples
(Figure 2B, p  <  0.05). In 21 cases of BCL6B reduced
cancer samples, 18 cases were methylated (Figure 2C).
Reduced expression was associated with promoter region
hypermethylation significantly (Figure 2D, p < 0.01). It
suggests that BCL6B is possibly regulated by promoter
region methylation in human primary HCC.

Restoration of BCL6B expression suppresses cell
proliferation, induces apoptosis and G1/S arrest
in HCC cells
The effect of BCL6B on cell proliferation was
analyzed by colony formation. The colony number
was 502.67 ± 50.01 vs. 118.67 ± 32.08 in HepG2 cells
(p  <  0.01) and 506.67 ± 90.89 vs. 198.67 ± 33.31 in
SNU449 cells (p < 0.01) before and after restoration of
BCL6B expression (Figure 3A). The results suggest that
HCC cell colony formation was suppressed by BCL6B.
The cell viability was detected by MTT. The OD value
is 1.174 ± 0.058 vs. 0.687 ± 0.046 (p < 0.01) in HepG2
cells and 0.873 ± 0.063 vs. 0.586 ± 0.034 (p < 0.01) in
SNU449 cells before and after restoration of BCL6B
expression (Figure 3B). It indicates that cell viability
was suppressed by BCL6B in HCC cells. To explore
the effect of BCL6B on apoptosis, flow cytometry was
employed. Early apoptosis was detected by staining
phosphatidylserin (PS) with Annexin V. The ratio of
apoptosis was 1.06 ± 0.72% vs. 4.73 ± 0.21% in HepG2
cells (p < 0.01), and 2.06  ±  0.90% vs. 7.8 ± 0.95% in
SNU449 cells (p < 0.01) before and after re-expression
of BCL6B. Late apoptosis was evaluated by propidium
iodide (PI) staining for broken down DNA. The ratio of
apoptosis was 1.80 ± 0.80% vs. 4.73 ± 1.75% in HepG2
cells (p > 0.05) and 0.86 ± 0.61% vs. 0.97 ± 0.81% in
SNU449 cells (p > 0.05) before and after re-expression of
BCL6B (Figure 3C). Above results suggest that BCL6B
induces apoptosis in the early step of liver carcinogenesis.
The effect of BCL6B on cell cycle was evaluated by
flow cytometry. The cell phase distribution in HepG2 cells
before and after re-expression of BCL6B was as follow: G1
phase: 60.32 ± 0.31% vs. 71.73 ± 1.71% (p < 0.01), S phase:
27.40 ± 0.71% vs. 18.53 ± 1.39% (p < 0.01), G2/M phase:
12.26 ± 1.02% vs. 9.74 ± 1.39% (p < 0.01). The cell phase
distribution in SNU449 cells before and after re-expression
of BCL6B was as follow: G1 phase: 56.14 ± 1.03% vs.
70.90 ± 0.92% (p < 0.01), S phase: 28.10 ± 1.32% vs. 21.36
± 1.38% (p < 0.05), G2/M phase: 15.77 ± 1.60% vs. 7.74
± 0.48% (p < 0.01). These results indicate that G1/S arrest
was induced by BCL6B (Figure 3D) in HCC cells.

BCL6B is frequently methylated in human
primary HCC and reduced expression
was associated with promoter region
hypermethylation
To investigate the methylation status of BCL6B,
149 cases of primary HCC, 50 cases of cancer adjacent
tissue and 8 cases of normal liver tissue samples were
examined by MSP. As shown in Figure 1B & 1C, 86.6%
(129/149) of HCC and 40.0% (20/50) of adjacent tissue
samples were methylated, but no methylation was found
in normal liver tissue samples. Methylation of BCL6B
is associated with HBV positive HCC (p < 0.05). No
association was found between BCL6B methylation and
hepatitis in adjacent tissue samples (p > 0.05). Existing
hepatitis was evaluated by elevated the level of aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT). No association was found between BCL6B
methylation and age, gender, tumor size, cell
differentiation and TNM stage (Table 1). The expression
of BCL6B was evaluated by IHC in 30 cases of available
HCC and matched adjacent tissue samples. Reduced
expression was found in 21  cases of cancer samples
and 9 cases of adjacent tissue samples (Figure  2A).
Reduced expression of BCL6B is significantly in

167 genes were up-regulated and 63 genes were downregulated over 3 times after re-expression of BCL6B in
SNU449 cells. Among these genes, HMGA2, CLDN1,
TFPI2, KIAA0101 and EGR1 are cancer related genes
according to Diseases Association Analysis (http://bioinfo
.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/). HMGA2, CLDN1, TFPI2
and EGR1 are up-regulated for 5, 3.3, 4.8 and 31.4 times,
and KIAA0101 was down-regulated for 3.2 respectively
(Figure 4B). Even through, the tendency of expression

Restoration of BCL6B expression activates
p53 signaling
EGR1 is a component of p53 signaling, which
suppresses cell growth in human lung cancer [13–17]. To
analyze the effect of BCL6B in p53 signaling in HepG2
and SNU449 cells, first we eliminated the possible effect
of p53 mutation on these cells. No p53 mutation was
found in HepG2 cells. While SNU449 carries a G to A
substitution at nucleotide 481 of the p53 gene, leading to

this mutation site is not related to the interacting region
of p53 with EGR1 [19]. To further understand the role
of BCL6B in HCC, the expression of EGR1 and p53
were detected before and after re-expression of BCL6B
in HepG2 and SNU449 cells. The expression of EGR1
and p53 were increased apparently after restoration
of BCL6B expression in HepG2 and SNU449 cells.

p53 signaling after restoration of BCL6B expression in
HepG2 and SNU449 cells. To see if BCL6B is involved
in 5-FU sensitivity in HCC cells, the sensitivity of HepG2
and SNU449 cells to 5-FU was analyzed before and
after re-expression of BCL6B. The IC50 of 5-FU was
13.27 ± 0.77 vs. 3.18 ± 0.28 μg/ml (p < 0.01) in HepG2
and 18.98  ±  0.86 versus 4.33 ± 1.18 μg/ml (p < 0.01)
in SNU449 cells before and after restoration of BCL6B
expression (Figure 5C). The results suggest that BCL6B
sensitized HCC cells to 5-FU.

The tumor suppressor p53 maintains DNA integrity
by transcriptionally activating genes such as p21
(CDKN1N) and GADD45a, the products of which induce
cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage [20–22].
However, depending on the cellular context and the
nature of the DNA damage, p53 can trigger elimination
of the damage cells by promoting apoptosis through the
induction of pro-apoptosis genes, such as Bax, and the
down-regulation of anti-apoptosis Bcl2 [23, 24]. In vitro
studies have reported that loss of p53 function reduces
cellular sensitivity to 5-FU [25, 26]. Disrupting both
alleles of TP53 or Bax in colon cancer cell line made the
cells strikingly resistant to apoptosis induced by 5-FU
compared with the parental line [25, 27, 28]. 5-FU is
widely used for cancer treatment and still the mainstay
of chemotherapy. Apoptosis was induced by activating

DISCUSSION
BCL6B is frequently methylated in human
hepatocellular carcinoma and the expression of BCL6B
was regulated by promoter region hypermethylation. It
suggests that BCL6B is a potential HCC detection marker
and BCL6B methylation may involved in hepatocellular

carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence reveals that viral
genes are one of the key players in regulating DNA
methylation. Particularly in cancers closely associated
with the hepatitis B virus, simian virus 40 (SV40),
and Epstein-Barr virus [29]. In vitro, HBx has been
documented to disturb the host DNA methylation system
by up-regulating DNMT expression and activities, which
in turn results in hypermethylation and repression of
some tumor suppressor genes (insulin-like growth factor
binding protein-3 gene, E-cadherin), thus increasing
tumor susceptibility [29–31]. Previous studies have
shown that HCC is associated with hypermethylation of
several tumor suppressor genes [32,  33]. We and other
groups have shown that some genes are preferentially
methylated in HCV-related HCC [6, 34]. In this study, we
found that BCL6B methylation is related to HBV positive
HCC. The result further suggests that HBV may promote
hepatocellular carcinogenesis by inducing promoter region
methylation in tumor suppressor. Further study found that
BCL6B suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis
and G1/S arrest in HCC cells. To further understand the
mechanism of BCL6B on hepatocellular carcinogenesis,
gene expression microarray was employed. By analyzing
the expression changes of genes before and after
re-expression of BCL6B in methylated HCC cell lines,
167 genes were up-regulated and 63 genes were downregulated over 3 times after re-expression of BCL6B in
SNU449 cells. Among these genes, HMGA2, CLDN1,
TFPI2, KIAA0101 and EGR1 are cancer related genes
according to Diseases Association Analysis and increased
expression of EGR1 was confirmed by further semiquantitative RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR and western
blot in BCL6B re-expressed HepG2 and SNU449 cells.
EGR1 was reported to suppress cell growth by regulating
p53 in lung cancer cells and BCL6B was reported
involved in p53 signaling in gastric cancer [11, 15–17].
Thus, we focused on the p53 signaling pathway in human
HCC. The expression of EGR1, p53, p21, caspase-3,
caspase-7, caspase-9, PARP and Bax was increased and
the expression of MDM2 and bcl-2 was reduced after
restoration of BCL6B expression in human HCC cells.
These results suggest that BCL6B activated p53 signaling
and induced apoptosis in human HCC cells. As p53
expression was regulated by EGR1 in human lung cancer
cells [15, 17]. It is reasonable to suggest that p53 signaling
was activated by BCL6B through EGR1 in human HCC.
It was reported before that p53 disruption rendered cells
strikingly resistant to the effects of the antimetabolite
5-FU in colorectal cancer [25]. We further analyzed the
sensitivity of BCL6B re-expressed and unexpressed HCC
cells to 5-FU. The results demonstrated that BCL6B
sensitized HCC cells to 5-FU. These results indicate that
BCL6B sensitizes HCC cell to 5-FU by activating p53
signaling.
In conclusion, BCL6B is frequently methylated
in human HCC and the expression of BCL6B was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulated by promoter region hypermethylation. BCL6B
suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in HCC
cells. EGR1, a key component of p53 signaling, was up
regulated by BCL6B in HCC cells. BCL6B activates p53
signaling and sensitizes HCC cells to 5-FU.

One hundred and forty-nine cases of primary
hepatic cancer were collected as fresh frozen tissue from
Chinese PLA General Hospital. All cases of hepatic
cancer were classified by TNM stage, including stage I
(N = 90), stage II (N = 24) and stage III (N = 35). Eight
cases of normal live tissue were collected as fresh frozen
tissue from hepatic hemangioma patients and 50 cases
of adjacent tissue samples were from primary hepatic
cancer patients in Chinese PLA General Hospital. Among
149  cancer samples, 30 cases of paraffin blocks are
available with matched adjacent tissue. All samples were
collected under the approved guidelines of the Chinese
PLA General Hospital’s institutional review board.

5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) treatment
HCC cell lines were split to low density (30%
confluence) 12 hours before treatment. Cells were treated
with 5-aza-2′-deoxy -cytidine (5-Aza) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) at a concentration of 2 μM. Growth medium,
conditioned with DAC at 2 uM, was exchanged every 24 h
for total 96 h treatment.

RNA isolation and semi-quantitative reverse
transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Life
Technologies,
Gaithersburg,
MD)
and

Oncotarget

(A260:280 nm ratio) was used to evaluate RNA
quality and quantity. Reverse transcription of RNA
(5 μg) was carried out according to the instruction of
Superscript III-reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Following first strand synthesis, the
cDNA was diluted to 100 μl using water. Subsequently,
2.5 μl of the diluted cDNA mixture was used for PCR
amplification in a final volume of 25 μl. A total of
35  cycles was amplified. GAPDH was amplified with
25 cycles to ensure cDNA quality and quantity for each
RT-PCR. RT-PCR primers of BCL6B are as follow: Sense:
5′- AAGCCGTATAAGTGTGAGACG -3′, antisense:
5′- CCGAGAATGTGGTAGTGCAC -3′. Amplified
products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels.

described previously [38, 39]. The staining intensity and
area extent were graded according to the German semiquantitative scoring system, which has been widely
accepted and used in previous studies [40–42]. In brief,
staining intensity of the nucleus, cytoplasm, and/or
membrane (no staining = 0; weak staining = 1; moderate
staining  =  2; strong staining  =  3); extent of stained
cells (0% = 0, 1–24% = 1, 25–49% = 2, 50–74% = 3, 75–
100% = 4). The final immunoreactive score (0 to 12) was
determined by multiplying intensity scores with the extent
of positivity scores of stained cells. The cutoff value is 4.

Colony formation and cell viability assay
Cells were plated in 6-well culture plates 24 h
before transfection and then were transfected with empty
vector pcDNA3.1 or the pcDNA3.1-HA-BCL6B vector.
The transfected cells were diluted and reseeded 24 h
later. Cells were seeded at 1000 cells and 1, 500 cells
per well in six-well culture plates in triplicate for HepG2
and  SNU449  cells. Transfected cells were selected in
400  ug/mL G418 (Invitrogen). After 14 days, colonies
were fixed with 75% ethanol for 30min and stained with
0.2% crystal violet for visualization and counting. The
number of colonies was counted under the microscope.
Cells (5 × 103) were seeded in 96 well plates,
incubated for 24 hours and transfected with pcDNA3.1HA-BCL6B or the empty vector pcDNA3.1. Cell
viability was determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol2-yl) -5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl )-2
H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA) at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after treatment,
respectively. Absorbance was measured on a microplate
reader (Thermo Multiskan MK3 USA) at a wavelength of
490 nm. The results were plotted as means ± SD. All assays
were performed in triplicate and repeated for three times.
The percentage of viable cells (%) = [A450–630(treated) A450–630(blank)]/[A450–630(control) - A450–630(blank)] × 100%.
IC50 was defined as the concentration, which was required
for 50% inhibition of cell growth. The values were
calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using SPSS
17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

DNA extraction and bisulfite modification
HCC cells and tissue samples were digested with
proteinase K. Then genomic DNA was isolated by phenolchloroform extraction. The extracted DNA was diluted in
TE buffer and stored at −20°C. 2 μg of genomic DNA
was diluted in 50 μl of water. The bisulfite treatment
was carried out for 16 h at 50°C. DNA samples were
then purified with the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System
(Promega, WI, USA), desulfonated with NaOH, and
then precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl
of water.

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite
sequencing (BSSQ)
MSP and BSSQ were performed as described
previously [36, 37]. Each PCR assay included a
methylation control, an unmethylation control and
water control. MSP and BSSQ primers were designed
around the transcriptional start site in the promoter
region of BCL6B (NM_181844.3). The primers
sequences are as follow: unmethylation-forward:
5′-TTTTGTTTTGGATTTGTTATTTGGAGAGT-3′,
unmethylation-reverse:
5′-CTTAACCTCAACTCCTTTATCTAACCA-3′,
methylation-forward:
5′CGTTTTGGATTCGTTATTTGGAGAGC-3′,
methylation-reverse:
5′- TAACCTCGACTCCTTTATCTAACCG -3′. BSSQforward: 5′- GTTTTTGAGGTTTYGTTTTYGAG -3′
BSSQ-reverse: 5′- CCTCAATCTCTTATTCTTACCC -3′.
The spanning of MSP and BSSQ amplification region of
BCL6B are 119bp and 227bp, respectively.

Flow cytometry analysis
For cell cycle analysis, briefly, after 12  hours
of synchronization by serum starvation, the
HepG2 and SNU449 cells transfected with BCL6B
expression  vector  or control empty vector 24 hours
before were re-stimulated with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) for 24 hours. Cells were fixed in 70%
ethanol and stained with  50 μg/ml propidium iodide
(BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). The cells were
then sorted by FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) and cell-cycle profiles were analyzed by
ModFit version 2.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham,
ME) as described in the previous article [7, 39].

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for BCL6B was
performed on 4 μm thick serial sections derived from
30  cases available matched cancer and adjacent tissue
paraffin blocks using antibody against BCL6B (1:100
dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) as

Protein preparation and western blot

Histograms were analyzed for cell cycle compartments
using Early and late apoptosis was detected by Annexin
V- FITC/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Detection Kit
(KeyGen Biotechnology, China).

Protein preparation and western blot were
performed  according to our previous report [43]. The
following primary antibodies were used: anti-BCL6B
(Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), anti-EGR1
(Epitomics, MA, USA), anti-MDM2 (Abgent, San
Diego, U.S.), anti-p53 (Bioworld Tech, MN, USA),
anti-bax (Beyotime Biotech, China), anti-bcl-2 (Cell
Signalinging Technology, USA), anti-caspase 3 (Abcam,
MA, USA), anti-caspase 7 (Abcam, MA, USA), anticaspase 9 (Abcam, MA, USA) and cleaved PARP (Cell
Signalinging Technology, USA), and β-actin (Beyotime
Biotech, China). β-actin was used in a reprobing as a
loading control. The blots were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce Bioscience, IL, USA).

In vitro chemosensitivity testing for HCC cells
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated
with 5-FU at the dose of 0, 0.36, 0.73, 1.56, 3.12, 6.25,
12.5, 25, 50, 100 μg/μl. The percentage of viable cells
was evaluated as described above. IC50 was defined as
the concentration, which was required for 50% inhibition
of cell growth.

Gene expression microarray analysis
RNA from BCL6B expressed and unexpressed
SNU449 cells were converted to cDNA labeled with
fluorescent dye (Cy3). The labeled cDNA were mixed
and hybridized to human gene expression array and then
washed, scanned, and analyzed. The gene expression
array (Agilent Human (4 × 44 k)) was provided by
Agilent Technologies. The ratio represents gene
expression alterations between BCL6B expressed and
unexpressed groups. The expression changed more than
3-fold was further analyzed by the software of Diseases
Association  Analysis (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/
webgestalt/) and validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR
and western blot.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Chi-square or Fischer’s
exact tests were used for evaluating the relationship between
methylation status and clinic-pathological characteristics.
All experiment data are presented as means ± standard
deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments.
Two-sided tests were used to determine significance, and
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
