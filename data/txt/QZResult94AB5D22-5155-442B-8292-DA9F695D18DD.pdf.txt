Abstract

Author Manuscript

RasGRP3, an activator for H-Ras, R-Ras and Rap1/2, has emerged as an important mediator of
signaling downstream from receptor coupled phosphoinositide turnover in B and T cells. Here, we
report that RasGRP3 showed a high level of expression in multiple human melanoma cell lines as
well as in a subset of human melanoma tissue samples. Suppression of endogenous RasGRP3
expression in these melanoma cell lines reduced Ras-GTP formation as well as c-Met expression
and Akt phosphorylation downstream from HGF or EGF stimulation. RasGRP3 suppression also
inhibited cell proliferation and reduced both colony formation in soft agar and xenograft tumor
growth in immunodeficient mice, demonstrating the importance of RasGRP3 for the transformed
phenotype of the melanoma cells. Reciprocally, overexpression of RasGRP3 in human primary
melanocytes altered cellular morphology, markedly enhanced cell proliferation, and rendered the
cells tumorigenic in a mouse xenograft model. Suppression of RasGRP3 expression in these cells
inhibited downstream RasGRP3 responses and suppressed cell growth, confirming the functional
role of RasGRP3 in the altered behavior of these cells. The identification of the role of RasGRP3
in melanoma highlights its importance, as a Ras activator, in the phosphoinositide signaling
pathway in human melanoma and provides a new potential therapeutic target.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

There is abundant evidence to suggest that Ras is a critical cell signaling element impacting
the development, maintenance, and progression of human melanoma, as it is in many other
cancers. N-Ras is mutated in 15–20% of human melanomas (Haluska and Ibrahim 2006).
The overexpression of mutated constitutively activated N-Ras in melanocytes of INK4a−/−
background transgenic mice resulted in abnormal proliferation of the melanocytes and
development of metastatic cutaneous melanoma (Ackermann et al 2005). Although H-Ras is
less frequently mutated in melanoma, the expression of a mutated constitutively activated HRas in wild type melanocytes induced melanocytic hyperplasia and contributed to their
susceptibility to develop melanoma in vivo (Broome Powell et al 1999). Activation of MRas was involved in MGSA/GRO-mediated melanocyte transformation (Wang et al 2000).
Activated R-Ras promoted integrin-mediated melanoma cell migration (Gawecka et al). In
addition, even when not mutated, wild-type Ras showed constitutive activation in many
melanoma cell lines but not in normal melanocytes (Satyamoorthy et al 2003).
The importance of the Ras signaling pathway in melanoma is further emphasized by the
frequency with which mutations are detected in the effector pathways downstream of Ras
signaling. Thus, mutations in B-Raf are found in some 60% of melanomas and mutations in
PTEN, an inhibitor of Akt activity, are found in 30% (Ikediobi et al 2006, Pollock et al
2003, Wu et al 2003). Likewise, suppression of the Ras/PI3K signaling pathway reduced
melanoma cell metastasis (Huang et al 2008).

Functionally, the RasGRPs act as immediate upstream activators of Ras isoforms. The
RasGRPs are regulated both by diacylglycerol binding to the C1 domains as well as through
phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which itself is regulated by diacylglycerol (Aiba et al
2004, Stone 2006, Zheng et al 2005). They should thus respond to the many receptor
tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled receptors which activate phospholipase C isoforms,
among other responses, leading to phospholipase C breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 3,5bisphosphate and generation of diacylglycerol. Therefore RasGRPs can physiologically and
simultaneously activate multiple downstream wild-type Ras family members and link them
to signals from the many upstream growth factors or cytokines which drive diacylglycerol
turnover, including the B receptor, T-cell receptor, hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal
growth factor (Aiba et al 2004, Brodie et al 2004, Lorenzo et al 2000, Lorenzo et al 2001,
Oh-hora et al 2003, Stone 2006, Stope et al 2004, Zheng et al 2005).

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidence indicates that RasGRPs can function as oncogenes in multiple cancers.
Overexpression of RasGRPs caused Ras activation coincident with cell transformation and
tumorigenesis in both mice and human (Oki-Idouchi and Lorenzo 2007, Suzuki et al 2002).
Highly expressed RasGRP3 has been found in human Burkitt's lymphoma, human pre–Bcell leukemia and human natural killer (NK)–like T-cell leukemia (Teixeira et al 2003).
Additionally, re-expression of RasGRP3 enhanced angiogenesis during pregnancy and
tumorigenesis (Roberts et al 2004). We recently reported that RasGRP3 expression was an
important contributor to the cancer phenotype in several human prostate cancer cell lines
(Yang et al 2010).

These observations have motivated a more extensive examination of RasGRP3 expression
and function in solid tumors. Here, we examine the role of RasGRP3 in melanoma.

Results
RasGRP3 is expressed in human melanoma tissues and multiple melanoma cell lines

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We examined the RasGRP3 mRNA expression level in a human melanoma tissue array by
mRNA in situ hybridization. Five out of forty melanoma tissue samples (samples A2, A5,
A6, B4 and D5 in Figure 1A) (12.5% of the melanomas) showed RasGRP3 expression
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A). None of the eight normal skin samples showed
expression (Figure 1A, columns labeled F). Using Q-PCR, we also examined a human
melanoma cDNA array for RasGRP3 expression. Marked variation (65-fold) in interindividual RasGRP3 expression was observed in the cDNA array (Supplementary Figure
1B). While we were unable to address how these levels of RasGRP3 expression in the
melanoma tissues compared to normal melanocytes in skin, we could, however, detect the
expression of RasGRP3 in most of the tested melanoma cell lines both by immunoblotting
(Figure 1B) and by RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 1C). In the human primary adult
melanocytes, the endogenous RasGRP3 expression was not detectable by immunoblotting.
The RasGRP3 was also unable to be detected by RT-PCR in the human primary adult
melanocytes (not shown). However, melanin binds and inhibits thermostable DNA
polymerase (Eckhart et al 2000, Sutlovic et al 2005) and the much higher levels of melanin
present in the melanocytes than in the melanoma cells lines caused interference, as
evidenced by reduced detection of GAPDH as well, necessitating caution in interpretation.
For comparison with the melanoma cell lines, we included the Ramos B-lymphoblastoid cell
line as a positive control in both assays, since the Ramos cells have been described as
expressing the highest endogenous level of RasGRP3 (Teixeira et al 2003). RasGRP3
protein was highly expressed in the SK-MEL-5 and UACC-257 cell lines (Figure 1B). It was
expressed at a lower level in the SK-MEL-2, UACC-62, M14, MALME-3M and SKMEL-28 cell lines (Figure 1B for protein and Supplementary Figure 1C for RNA levels). In
the human adult primary melanocytes, RasGRP3 expression was not detectable under these
conditions (Figure 1B). It should be noted that there was not exact correspondence between
the levels of RasGRP3 protein detected by immunoblotting (Figure 1B) and the levels of
message as detected by RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 1C). Thus, whereas SK-MEL-5
showed the highest expression by both methods, the M14 cell line showed relatively lower
expression by immunoblotting than by RT-PCR. Since we know, for example, that the
RasGRP3 antibody response is greater for phosphorylated RasGRP3 (data not shown) than
for unphosphorylated RasGRP3, the relative levels should be viewed as approximate.

Down regulation of RasGRP3 suppressed proliferation of multiple human melanoma cell
lines
In five of eight melanoma cell lines, transient inhibition of endogenous RasGRP3 expression
(Figure 2A) was accompanied by substantial inhibition of cell proliferation; less (but still
significant) inhibition was observed in the LOX-IMVI, SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 cell
lines (Figure 2A). While the basis for the reduced response is not known, the LOX-IMVI
cells expressed the lowest level of RasGRP3 expression of the cell lines examined. The SK-

MEL-2 cells express a constitutively active N-Ras, meaning that this major Ras family
member no longer requires an upstream activator, and the SK-MEL-28 cell line is mutated
in the EGF receptor (see Supplementary Table 3 for a listing of mutations in each of the cell
lines examined) (Ikediobi et al 2006). To achieve long term suppression of RasGRP3
expression, we established cell lines derived from M14 and SK-MEL-5 cells expressing teton inducible RasGRP3 shRNA. The specific shRNAs were selected based on their ability to
knockdown the exogenous RasGRP3-V5 in RasGRP3-LNCaP cells (Supplementary Figure
2A) and the endogenous RasGRP3 in M14 cells (Supplementary Figure 2B).

Because of promoter leakage with the tet-on system, the level of endogenous RasGRP3
expression in the absence of tetracycline was already somewhat reduced in the M14
derivative sh854 cell line and in both of the SK-MEL-5 derivative cell lines, sh236 and
sh854 (Figure 2B and C). To confirm the specificity of the effects of the RasGRP3 shRNAs,
we created a mutated variant of RasGRP3 retaining the amino acid sequence of RasGRP3
but altered in its coding sequence to diminish the homology with shRNA854. Stable cell
lines were prepared by introducing this RasGRP3 mutant into the SK-MEL-5 derivative
sh854 cell line. After inducing shRNA expression, RasGRP3 expression was detected by
either RT-PCR in the M14 cells or by immunoblotting in the SK-MEL-5 cells (Figure 2B
and C). Inhibition of cell proliferation mirrored the suppression of RasGRP3 expression. A
reduction in cell growth was detected in the cells that already expressed a reduced amount of
RasGRP3 as a result of promoter leakage of the shRNA, as compared with the cell lines
expressing a normal level of RasGRP3 (Figure 2B and C). A further reduction in cell
proliferation accompanied the further reduction of RasGRP3 caused by induction of the
shRNA expression. The control shRNAs had little effect on cell growth (Figure 2B and C).
Expression of the shRNA854 resistant RasGRP3 mutant maintained RasGRP3 expression
and rendered the cell growth rate insensitive to expression of the shRNA854 (Figure 2C).
Expression of the RasGRP3 mutant by itself did not affect cell proliferation compared to the
control (p = 0.62).
Inhibition of endogenous RasGRP3 expression inhibited anchorage independent growth
and suppressed xenograft tumor growth of both the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines

Author Manuscript

For both M14 and SK-MEL-5 cells, inhibition of endogenous RasGRP3 expression
decreased both the total number and size of colonies in soft agar (Figure 3A, B and
Supplementary Figure 3A and B) compared to controls. Expressing the mutant RasGRP3
partially blocked the inhibition of the growth in soft agar caused by the shRNA854 (Figure
3B and Supplementary Figure 3B). There was no significant difference in number of
colonies between the control cell line and the cell line expressing the RasGRP3 mutant (p =
0.58) in the absence of shRNA854 induction (Figure 3B).
The involvement of endogenous RasGRP3 in tumorigenesis was assessed in a mouse
xenograft model, using the cell lines expressing either control shRNA or the shRNA854.
Expression of the shRNA854 caused a marked reduction in tumor growth as measured by
weight of excised tumors both of the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines (Figure 3C, D, Table 1
and Table 2). Deoxytetracycline induction had no effect on tumor growth in control cells.
Likewise, in the shRNA854 derived SK-MEL-5 cells expressing the mutated RasGRP3

deoxytetracycline treatment failed to affect tumor growth (Figure 3D and Table 2).
Expression of the RasGRP3 mutant did not significantly affect tumor growth, compared
with control cells (p = 0.27), in the absence of the shRNA854 induction (Figure 3D and
Table 2).
Endogenous RasGRP3 contributes to Ras and Akt1/2/3 activation as well as c-Met
expression in multiple melanoma cell lines

Author Manuscript

RasGRP3 has been reported to activate H-Ras, R-Ras, and Rap1/2, among Ras family
members (Yamashita et al 2000). To clarify the role of RasGRP3 in melanoma cell
signaling, its effects on activation of Ras and downstream effectors were investigated.
Inhibition of RasGRP3 expression was accompanied by a reduced level of Ras-GTP in M14,
SK-MEL-5, UACC-62 and UACC-257 cells (Figure 4A), confirming that RasGRP3 was
indeed an important contributor to the state of Ras activation in these cells. These results
were also confirmed in M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines expressing inducible RasGRP3
shRNAs (Supplementary Figure 5C).

It has been reported that activation of the EGF receptor and the B-cell receptor trigger PKC
or Src mediated RasGRP3 activation through its phosphorylation followed by activation of
the Ras pathway (Aiba et al 2004, Stope et al 2004, Zheng et al 2005). Moreover, activated
H-Ras in turn activates PI3K (Pacold et al 2000, Rodriguez-Viciana et al 1994). Thus we
have evaluated involvement of RasGRP3 in the response of the melanoma cells to multiple
growth factors and cytokines including HGF, EGF, V-EGF, TGF-β and TNF-α
(Supplementary Figure 4A). HGF treatment led to Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in M14,
SK-MEL-5, UACC-257 (Figure 4A), SK-MEL-2, SKMEL-28, and MALME-3M cells
(Supplementary Figure 4A). In the UACC-62 cells, HGF was without effect but instead EGF
enhanced Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 4A). Transient suppression of
endogenous RasGRP3 decreased both basal and HGF induced Akt phosphorylation in the
M14, SK-MEL-5, and UACC-257 cells (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 5A), as well
as the SK-MEL-28 cells (Supplementary Figure 5B). In the UACC-62 cells, suppression of
endogenous RasGRP3 expression reduced both the basal and EGF induced Akt
phosphorylation (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 5A). In the SK-MEL-2 cells downregulation of RasGRP3 expression decreased HGF induced Akt phosphorylation but did not
affect the basal level of Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 5B). Consistent with a
modest effect of RasGRP3 knockdown on proliferation of the SK-MEL-2 cells, which bear a
constitutive N-Ras mutation, this result may reflect the influence of other family members in
these cells. Additionally, down regulation of RasGRP3 by inducible shRNA also reduced
the HGF-induced Akt phosphorylation in both the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines (Figure
4B). Once again, the exogenous RasGRP3 mutant enhanced the level of phosphorylated Akt
in the SK-MEL-5 cells (Figure 4B). Consistent with the central role of the Akt pathway in
the survival of these cells, decreasing the level of p-Akt using an Akt inhibitor resulted in
significant inhibition of cell proliferation in all the cell lines (Supplementary Figure 4B).
Expression of c-Met, the receptor for HGF, was also affected by the level of RasGRP3.
Inhibition of RasGRP3 expression led to reduction of c-Met expression in both M14 and
SK-MEL-5 cell lines (Figure 4C).

Transformation of human adult melanocytes by overexpressing RasGRP3

Author Manuscript

To further explore the biological role of RasGRP3 in human melanoma, we overexpressed
RasGRP3-V5 in human adult primary melanocytes (Pu et al 2005). Relative to the control
melanocytes, the RasGRP3 overexpressing melanocytes showed a cuboidal shape with
shorter, less numerous processes resembling SK-MEL-5 cells (Figure 5A). The RasGRP3melanocytes lost or showed greatly diminished expression of the melanocyte markers
tyrosinase and melanin A (Figure 5B). Their S100 expression was detected (Figure 5B).
Opposite to the effects on cell signaling caused by inhibition of endogenous RasGRP3 in
melanoma cells, overexpression of RasGRP3 in melanocytes was accompanied by an
elevated level of Ras activation, Akt activation and c-Met expression (Figure 5B). These
results further support the role of RasGRP3 in the HGF/c-Met and PI3K/Akt signaling
pathways in melanoma.

Author Manuscript

After 3 weeks antibiotic selection, the stable RasGRP3-melanocytes showed a markedly
enhanced growth rate comparing to control melanocytes, without melanocyte growth
medium. The doubling time of the cells is around 12 hours (Figure 5C). Furthermore,
following subcutaneous injection of these cells (after three weeks of antibiotic selection),
they formed tumors in immunodeficient mice, whereas no detectable growth was observed
for control melanocytes (Figure 5D). As a further control in this system, reduction in the
level of exogenous RasGRP3 expression markedly retarded the RasGRP3-melanocyte's
proliferation (Figure 5E), accompanied by a reduced level of basal Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 5F).

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

It is has been clearly identified that the Ras pathway plays a crucial role in human
melanoma. However, only 15% of human melanomas contain a Ras gene mutation. The
cases containing a constitutively activated Ras mutation are even less (Ball et al 1994, van
Elsas et al 1995). More frequent in melanoma are mutations in signaling elements
downstream of Ras, such as B-Raf and PTEN (Ikediobi et al 2006, Pollock et al 2003, Wu et
al 2003). But none of them is sufficient to initiate melanoma by itself (Cully et al 2006,
Dankort et al 2009, Sumimoto et al 2004). Changes in upstream signaling elements provide
a complementary approach to influence the Ras pathway. As Ras activators, RasGRPs could
be candidate molecules to play such a role. Our data show substantial RasGRP3 expression
in multiple human melanoma cell lines as well as in subset of human melanoma tissue
samples. Our findings provide evidence that RasGRP3 expression has broader tissue
distribution than has been generally recognized (Coughlin et al 2005, Roberts et al 2004,
Teixeira et al 2003). The elevated RasGRP3 level does not appear to result from increased
copy number of RasGRP3 in either melanoma tumors or melanoma cell lines (Bastian et al
2003, Bauer and Bastian 2006, Stark and Hayward 2007). On the other hand, RasGRP3 is
subject both to developmental silencing as well as induction by growth factors (Roberts et al
2004).
Suppression of endogenous RasGRP3 inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage independent
growth and xenograft tumor growth of melanoma cell lines. Thus, the endogenous RasGRP3
contributes to the phenotype of multiple melanoma cell lines. This finding was strongly

supported by the effects of overexpressing RasGRP3 in normal human adult melanocytes,
which caused greatly enhanced cell growth and conferred tumorigenicity. Suppression of
endogenous RasGRP3 expression in melanoma cell lines reduced Ras-GTP formation as
well as c-Met expression and Akt phosphorylation downstream from HGF or EGF
stimulation. We conclude that the regulation of wild-type Ras at its physiological expression
level by upstream growth factors is mediated in part through endogenous RasGRP3 in
human melanoma cells. Thus, RasGRP3/Ras represents an important node linking the
HGF/c-Met and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in melanoma. These findings help fill out our
current understanding of the HGF/C-Met/Ras/PI3K/AKT signaling networks in melanoma
(Furge et al 2001, Khwaja et al 1997, Orian-Rousseau et al 2007, Takayama et al 1997). As
described by other researchers, a BRAF mutation (V600E) is the most common mutation in
human melanoma (Haluska and Ibrahim 2006). Compared to wild type BRAF, BRAFV600E
shows around 500-fold higher activity, causing sustained activation of ERK signaling
(Hingorani et al 2003, Houben et al 2004, Ikenoue et al 2003, Ikenoue et al 2004,
Karasarides et al 2004). Seven out of the eight tested melanoma cell lines contain a BRAF
mutation (V600E) (Supplementary Table 3). Highly activated ERK1/2 was detected in all
tested melanoma cell lines. Treatment of HGF and EGF did not lead to further activation of
ERK1/2, except in the SK-MEL-5 cells. Inhibition of RasGRP3 affected neither the basal
level of ERK1/2 activation nor HGF induced ERK1/2 activation (data not show).

Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) is another member of the Ras family of small GTPases and
a target of RasGRP3 (Yamashita et al 2000). Along with Ras, Rap1 has been shown to
influence melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis through regulating the activation of
MAPK pathway and integrin activation (Gao et al 2006). Its activity in human melanoma is
regulated not only by activators but also an inactivator, Rap1 GTPase-activating protein
(GAP). Rap1GAP expression was decreased in human melanoma tumors and cell lines, but
not in benign nevus cells, reflecting promoter hypermethylation (Zheng et al 2009). This
down-regulation of Rap1Gap caused marked elevation of Rap1 activation and promoted
melanoma cell proliferation, survival, and migration (Zheng et al 2009). In preliminary
experiments, we did not observe a change in Rap1-GTP levels upon suppression of
RasGRP3 expression in the SK-MEL-5 cells (data not shown). If correct, this may suggest
that the rate limiting regulator of Rap1, at least in this cell line, is either RasGAP or one or
more of the other known RapGEFs in addition to RasGRP3 (Guo et al 2001, Ohba et al
2001).

Serrano and Chodosh reported that highly expressed constitutive H-Ras induced senescence
in human or rodent primary cells (Sarkisian et al 2007, Serrano et al 1997). But Chodosh
and colleagues also showed that a lower level of oncogenic RAS expression did not caused
cellular senescence. In contrast, it promoted continuous cell proliferation in vitro and tumor
formation in vivo (Sarkisian et al 2007). In addition, endogenous expression of constitutive
active K-RAS is sufficient to initiate epithelial cells transformation and promote
tumourigenesis without detectable senescence (Tuveson et al 2004). These studies support
the idea that oncogenic effects of Ras family members are critically dependent on the
intensity of the Ras signal and the type of Ras isoform. In our study, introduction of
RasGRP3 caused outgrowth of transformed human primary melanocytes. As an activator of

multiple Ras isoforms, the downstream biological effects of overexpressed RasGRP3 should
be more complex than biological response triggered by overexpression of a single a Ras
isoform. Compared to the uncontrolled constitutively active Ras, RasGRP3 introduced into
melanocytes still performed as a normal cellular signal transducer which was able to respond
to extracellular stimulation. The intensity of the downstream Ras signal would thus depend
on the intensity of biological extracellular stimulation rather than on the expression level of
single mutated activated Ras. Additionally, the outgrowing RasGRP3 overexpressing cells
will necessarily reflect selection against senescence, to the degree that it might have
occurred in some cells.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our findings further highlight the importance of the RasGRP3/Ras pathway in
melanoma, as already clear from analysis of mutations in B-Raf and PTEN associated with
melanoma, but also emphasize the complexity of this pathway. Since it was expressed at a
high level in a subset of human melanomas, contributing to melanoma tumorigenicity and
involved in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, RasGRP3 represents a novel potential
therapeutic target for certain human melanomas.

RasGRP3 expression in melanoma tumors and tumor cell lines. (A) Detection of RasGRP3
expression in human melanoma tissues by in situ hybridization. Tissue microarrays (Biomax
Inc) were hybridized with antisense probes 1 and 2 generated against two non-overlapping
regions of the RasGRP3 mRNA. Sense fragments were used as negative controls. A positive
autoradiographic signal is detected in samples # A2, A5, A6, B4 and D5, by both probes.
There is no detectable specific signal in the normal skin samples (F columns). Higher
magnification pictures (lower panel left and right) show labeled cells within the tissue
samples #B4 and #D5 of the array. Silver grains (black dots) deposited over the cells
indicate the localization of radiolabeled molecules hybridized to endogenous mRNA. The
tissue is stained with Giemsa solution. Scale bars: 100 μm. (B) Expression of endogenous
RasGRP3 in multiple cell lines. The RasGRP3 levels in the total cell lysates of individual
cell lines containing 40 μg total protein were detected by immunoblotting. Ramos cells were
used as positive control. The results are representative of 3 individual experiments.

Inhibition of endogenous RasGRP3 expression retarded cell proliferation in multiple human
melanoma cell lines. (A) Individual cell lines were transiently transfected with RasGRP3
siRNA pool and Control siRNA pool 1 at 80 nM final concentration. After 96 hours, cell
proliferation was determined by using the CyQuant NF cell proliferation assay, with values
normalized to the levels of untreated cells. Values represent the mean ± SEM for four
independent experiments. Confirmation of the extent of suppression of RasGRP3 was
determined by immunoblotting. Results are representative of 3 experiments. (B and C)The
Tet-on stable cell lines created from the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines were seeded at a
density of 104 cells/ml in complete growth medium. Cells were treated with/without 1 μg/ml
tetracycline for 120 hours and proliferation was determined by using the CyQuant NF cell
proliferation assay, with values normalized to the levels of parental M14 or SK-MEL-5
cells. Values represent the mean ± SEM of four independent experiments. Endogenous
RasGRP3 expression was determined by RT-PCR (M14) or immunoblot (SK-MEL-5) 120
hours after induction. Results are representative of three independent experiments.

Reduction of endogenous RasGRP3 expression inhibited anchorage independent growth and
rate of tumor growth of both M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines. (A and B) Colonies were
imaged 10 days after plating the cells in soft agar. The number of colonies larger than the
median size of the corresponding control (colonies of the cells expressing the scrambled
control shRNA 1 in the absence of tetracycline) were counted and expressed as a percent of
the colony number of the control. Values represent mean +/− SEM of the three independent
experiments. (C and D) NOD.SCID/NCr mice were injected subcutaneously in the flanks
with 1×107 cells/injection of the indicated M14 and SK-MEL-5 derived lines. On the eighth
day after injection, half the animals in each treatment group were shifted to food containing
deoxytetracycline. The animals were sacrificed 12 weeks (M14) or 8 weeks (SK-MEL-5)
after injection, and the tumors were excised and weighed.

RasGRP3 is involved in Ras and Akt activation. (A) Individual cell lines were transiently
transfected with RasGRP3 siRNA pool and Control siRNA pool 1 at 80 nM final
concentration. After 72 hours, cells were treated with or without HGF (20 ng/mL) or EGF
(100 pg/ml) as indicated for 20 minutes. Ras-GTP levels were detected by pull-down assay
from 200 μg total protein. Levels of total Ras were used as control. Akt and phosphorylated
Akt were detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates. (B) The Tet-on stable cell lines created
from the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines were treated with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for120
hours. The cells were then treated with/without HGF (20 ng/mL) for 20 minutes. The Akt
and phosphorylated Akt were detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates. (C) The Tet-on
stable cell lines created from the M14 and SK-MEL-5 cell lines were treated with
tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 120 hours as indicated. Expression of c-Met was detected by
immunoblotting of cell lysates. All results in this figure were representative of 3

Effect of RasGRP3 expression on normal melanocytes. (A) Phase constrast imaging of
normal human adult melanocytes and of the RasGRP3-melanocytes. SK-MEL-5 cells are
shown for comparison. Images are representative of 3 independent experiments. (B) Cell
lysates of RasGRP3-melanocytes (MelGRP3), keratinocytes (K), and primary adult
melanocytes (Mel) were assayed by immunoblotting as indicated (melanin A, MelA).
Results are representative of 3 independent experiments. (C) Control adult melanocytes and
RasGRP3-melanocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% normal FBS for 5 days. The
plates were scanned in the IncuCyte™ at one hour intervals for 60 hours. The data were
analyzed by the IncuCyte™ cell proliferation assay software. Results are representative of 3
independent experiments. (D) NOD.SCID/NCr mice (7 mice for each group) were injected
subcutaneously in the flanks with RasGRP3-Melanocytes or control melanocytes (plenti/V5GW/lacZ), 5×106 cells/injection. The injected mice were fed with a regular diet and
sacrificed after 5 weeks. The tumors were then excised and weighed. (E) RasGRP3melanocytes were transduced with virus containing scrambled shRNA control or sh236
respectively. Cell proliferation was determined 120 hours after transduction using the
CyQuant NF cell proliferation assay. The values are normalized to that of untreated group.
Values are mean ± SEM of 3 independent experiments. (F) Cells were treated as in panel E.
RasGRP3 expression, Akt and p-Akt were detected by immunoblotting. Results are
representative of three independent experiments.
