BACKGROUND: Patients with T-cell lymphomas face a poorer prognosis compared with patients with B-cell lymphomas. New therapeutic approaches need to be developed to improve outcomes for these patients. METHODS: Forty patients with recurrent and refractory T-cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides and patients with untreated T-cell lymphoma who were not candidates for
combination chemotherapy were prescribed oral lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg daily on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle, with
standardized dose reductions for toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were
complete and partial response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. The authors also determined
duration of response (DoR). RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the current study; 1 patient was subsequently deemed
ineligible. The ORR was 10 of 39 patients (26%); 3 patients (8%) achieved complete responses and 7 patients achieved partial
responses. Three patients had stable disease for 5 cycles. The median OS was 12 months (range <1 month to 69 months), the
median PFS was 4 months (range, <1 month to 50 months), and the median DoR was 13 months (range 2 months to 37 months),
including 5 responses that lasted >1 year. Toxicity was in keeping with the known safety profile of lenalidomide. Among the patients
who had recurrent/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (29 patients), the ORR was 24%, the median OS was 12 months, the
median PFS was 4 months, and the median DoR was 5 months (range, 2 months to 37 months). CONCLUSIONS: In the current
study, the use of oral lenalidomide monotherapy demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy among patients with systemic T-cell
lymphomas. It appears to have excellent potential as an agent in combination therapy for patients with T-cell lymphoma. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, many of which share a poor prognosis.
Peripheral TCLs (PTCLs), lymphomas arising from mature T cells, comprise the majority of TCLs.1 Using conventional
therapies, the 5-year survival rate for the most common histological subtypes of PTCL is 32%.1 Current first-line therapy
is based on therapeutic strategies for B-cell lymphoma and to the best of our knowledge there is no current consensus
regarding strategies for patients with recurrent and refractory PTCL; rather, there are many proposed strategies.2-4 New
therapeutic options are needed to improve outcomes for patients with TCL.
Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analog and immunomodulatory agent. Single-agent lenalidomide therapy has been
reported to demonstrate clinical activity in several hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma,5 chronic
lymphocytic leukemia,6 recurrent and refractory PTCL,1,7,8 B-cell lymphoma,9 and recurrent/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.10 There are several potential mechanisms of action associated with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide inhibits the
proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)21b, and IL-6 and increases IL-10.11 It is a stimulator of Th1-type cells that can lead to an increase in interferon-c and IL-2 causing subsequent T-cell proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell stimulation.12 Lenalidomide can help repair the T-cell synapse response.13 Lenalidomide also helps
recruit NK cells via dendritic cells14 and enhances the cytotoxic function of NK cells.15 Lenalidomide demonstrates antiangiogenic properties14 by inhibiting growth factor-induced Akt phosphorylation.16 More recently, lenalidomide has

been found to mediate its anticancer effects in myeloma
through binding to cereblon, leading to degradation of
the lymphoid transcription factors IKZF1/3.17,18 Lenalidomide represents a robust antineoplastic agent that can
provide patients with an option beyond conventional
combination chemotherapy. In the interim report for the
current study, it was shown that lenalidomide monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with T-cell
lymphoma.1
In the current study, we report the final results of a
phase 2 clinical trial of oral lenalidomide monotherapy
for patients with TCLs other than mycosis fungoides.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study follows the ethical principles outlined by the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Alberta
Cancer Board Research Ethics Board. The patients
included in the current study were recruited from 5 different centers across Canada. All patients provided their
written informed consent. The age of the consenting
patients was 18 years. The included patients had histologically proven TCL (excluding mycosis fungoides).
Both patients with recurrent/refractory disease after at
least 1 line of chemotherapy and untreated patients with
contraindications to chemotherapy were allowed to take
part in the study. Patients with prior radiotherapy or autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant were allowed. All
previous cancer therapy must have been discontinued at
least 4 weeks before participation in the study. The
patients must have had at least 1 measurable lesion (measuring 2 cm in diameter as measured on computed tomography scan or clinical examination) and their World
Health Organization (WHO) performance status must
have been 2 at the time they entered the study; highly
selected patients with a WHO performance status of 3
were granted an eligibility waiver and allowed to enroll if
they were believed to be otherwise fit to participate by
both the treating physician and the central study team. To
meet the written eligibility criteria, the patient’s laboratory test results must have been within the following
ranges: absolute neutrophil count of 1.03109/L, platelet count of 753109/L, serum creatinine 200 mmol/L,
total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal
(ULN), and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 2 times the ULN or 5 times the ULN if
hepatic metastases were present. The patients must also
have been free of a prior malignancy for 5 years with the
exception of currently treated basal cell or squamous cell

carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma “in situ” of the cervix
or breast.
The exclusion criteria for the current study included
mycosis fungoides histology, women who were pregnant
or lactating, or prior use of lenalidomide.

Study Design

The current study was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Canadian phase 2 clinical trial primarily designed
to assess the overall response rate (ORR) to lenalidomide
among patients with TCL. The trial was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00322985. The primary endpoint was the ORR. The secondary endpoints included
the complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)
rates, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
(PFS), duration of response (DoR), and safety.
Patients in the current study were treated with oral
lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 21 days
with 7 days of rest during a 28-day cycle. Patients received
enough lenalidomide for 1 cycle and were instructed to
take their dose in the morning at approximately the same
time each day. Patients were asked to record their use of
the drug and to return any unused drug capsules at the
time of each visit to document compliance. A new course
of treatment could begin on schedule if the patient’s absolute neutrophil count was 1000/mL, the platelet count
was 50,000/ mL, there had been no lenalidomiderelated allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, there had been
no sinus bradycardia/other cardiac arrhythmia adverse
events (AEs) that had resolved to <grade 1 in severity, and
no lenalidomide-related AEs had resolved to <grade 2 in
severity. If those conditions were not met on day 1,
patients were evaluated weekly. Treatment continued
until there was evidence of disease progression, intolerable
side effects, patient withdrawal from the study, or death.
Dose modifications were prescribed in the protocol
and are described in the interim report.1 Treatment was
discontinued for desquamating rash of any grade, grade 4
nonblistering rash, erythema multiforme of grade 3,
grade 4 allergic reaction or hypersensitivity, or sinus bradycardia/other cardiac arrhythmia of grade 3.
Patients received full supportive care, including
transfusion of blood and blood products, antibiotics, and
antiemetics as per the decision of the investigator. The
patients could not have received any other drug therapy
within 28 days of baseline. Corticosteroid treatment was
allowed to treat nausea or peritumoral edema (maximum
dose of dexamethasone of 4 mg orally 4 times daily or its
equivalent) but not at higher doses as an antineoplastic.

Prophylactic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy was
allowed at the discretion of the investigator.
Response and Safety Assessments

Patients were screened for the study 28 days before baseline (day 1 of cycle 1). Study visits occurred on day 1 of
every 28-day cycle. The target lesions were assessed by
computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and every 3 treatment cycles thereafter.
Bone marrow biopsy was performed during screening and
was only repeated to confirm a complete remission, and
only if the pretreatment bone marrow biopsy demonstrated evidence of lymphoma. Response and disease progression were evaluated based on the International
Working Group Lymphoma Response Criteria.19
Patients who discontinued the study were monitored for
at least 30 days for toxicities, a safety assessment was com718

pleted approximately 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide was administered, and there was follow-up
contact for a minimum of every 3 months for survival and
progression data.
Patients underwent a safety evaluation every 28 days
that included AEs, vital signs, hematology, and serum
chemistry profiles. Serum thyroid function was assessed at
screening, at the end of cycle 3, and then every 3 subsequent cycles. Pregnancy testing in women of childbearing
potential was completed 14 days before treatment, 24
hours before treatment, weekly in cycle 1, and then
monthly if menstruation was regular or every 2 weeks if it
was irregular.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint of the current study was the ORR.
The ORR was defined in this trial as the percentage of
patients who achieved either a PR, an unconfirmed CR,
or a CR. The study also collected data regarding secondary endpoints including PFS, OS, DoR, and the incidence
of AEs. AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).
The study was designed to accrue a maximum of 40
patients in a 2-stage design. In the first stage, 22 patients
were accrued and the results were analyzed. The study
would have been stopped if 1 of the first 22 patients had
responded to therapy. The remaining patients were added
in the second stage. The drug would be considered inactive if <4 of 40 patients responded. The a level of the
design was .04, and the power was 0.9 in the case of a true
response rate of at least 20%. Patient demographics, disease baseline characteristics, response rates, and the occurrence of AEs are expressed as percentages. OS, PFS, and
DoR were described using Kaplan-Meier curves. KaplanMeier curves and all statistical analyses were completed
using Graph Pad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software
Inc, La Jolla, Calif).
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Disease
Characteristics

In the current study, there were 40 patients who were
recruited at 5 centers across Canada. Patients were accrued
from 2006 until 2012. The rate of accrual reflected the
rarity of the diseases at the participating centers. Thirtynine patients were deemed eligible to participate, and
there was 1 patient enrolled who was subsequently
deemed ineligible due to unmeasurable disease at baseline.

39 eligible participants are summarized in Table 1. The
median age of the patients was 65 years. The WHO performance status was 0 to 1 in 29 patients, 2 in 8 patients,
and 3 in 2 patients. The histologies included PTCL
unspecified (14 patients), angioimmunoblastic TCL
(9 patients), anaplastic large cell TCL (10 patients),
enteropathy-type TCL (2 patients), hepatosplenic
gamma/delta TCL (2 patients), and lymphoblastic TCL
(2 patient). Thirty-one patients (80%) had previously
undergone treatment with combination chemotherapy
and 1 patient was treated with a single agent. Of the previously treated patients, 29 had recurrent or refractory
PTCL and 2 patients had lymphoblastic TCL. Of these
patients, 5 patients (16%) had undergone prior stem cell
transplant and 11 patients (34%) were refractory to treatment. The median number of prior therapies was 1 (range
0-5 prior therapies). The median time from the completion of prior therapy to the initiation of lenalidomide
therapy was 5.5 months (range, 1-48 months). The 8

(median age, 79 years) and, due to a combination of age
and comorbidities, were believed by their treating physicians to be at high risk of experiencing severe toxicity
from combination chemotherapy. Increased age was
found to be significantly and negatively correlated with

common grade 4 AE was pain, not otherwise specified
(21%); neutropenia (13%); muscle weakness (10%);
dyspnea (10%); and dehydration (10%) were the most
commonly reported grade 3 AEs. Table 3 describes the
occurrence of all reported grade 3 and grade 4 AEs.
Ten patients (26%) experienced at least 1 dose
reduction; among those patients, there were 18 dose
reductions in total. The reason for the dose reduction was
listed for 15 of these 18 cases and included neutropenia in
5 cases; diarrhea in 2 cases; Clostridium difficile infection
in 2 cases; and febrile neutropenia, rash, hypothyroidism,
thrombocytopenia, fatigue/weakness, and pulmonary embolism in 1 case each. The mean relative dose intensity per
cycle for the cohort was 82% and the median was 100%;
among the patients receiving dose reductions, the mean
relative dose intensity over the entire treatment course
ranged from 56% to 98%.
Patients discontinued therapy for the following reasons: death while actively receiving treatment (7 patients),
disease progression (19 patients), AEs (10 patients), or
withdrawal from the study (1 patient). Two patients were
continuing on therapy at the time of last follow-up and 29
patients had died on study. No deaths were attributed to
lenalidomide toxicity; 5 of the deaths that occurred during
treatment were attributed to disease progression and 2
were attributed to pneumonia, which in 1 case was determined retrospectively to have been present before the initiation of lenalidomide therapy and was diagnosed on day
8 of the first cycle.
Response

The ORR was 10 of 39 patients (26%) (Figure 4). Three
were CRs and 7 were PRs. Three patients had stable disease for 5 cycles. One of the patients was reported as
having achieved a PR in the interim report by radiologic
measurements but the response assessment was changed
to progressive disease based on detailed review of the clinical course. Responses occurred in anaplastic TCL (ORR,
720

10%), angioimmunoblastic TCL (ORR, 33%), and
PTCL unspecified (ORR, 43%) histologies. The median
OS was 12 months (Figure 1, range, <1 month to 69
months), the median PFS was 4 months (Figure 2, range,
<1 month to 50 months), and the median DoR was 13
months (Figure 3, range 2 months to 37 months),
including 5 responses lasting >1 year (Table 4).
Rash was an AE that was more commonly reported
among responders. Of the 11 patients who responded to
treatment, 7 developed a rash. Conversely, 7 of 15
patients who reported a rash also responded to the study
drug. A Fisher exact test was used to assess the relationship
between developing a rash and response, and a statistically
insignificant relationship was found between the two (P
5.0685). There was a significant relationship found
between age and response: the median age of the responders was 76.0 years whereas the median age of the nonresponders was 63.5 years (P 5.0164). There was no
relationship found between response and WHO performance status, time to treatment, or patient sex.
Among the patients who had recurrent/refractory
PTCL (29 patients), the ORR was 24%, the median OS
was 12 months, the median PFS was 4 months, and the
median DoR was 5 months (range, 2 months to 37
months).
The ORR of the subpopulation of previously
untreated patients who were not eligible for combined
chemotherapy (8 patients) was 50%, the median OS was
22 months (range, <1 month to 38 months), the median PFS was 2 months (range, <1 month to 38
months), and the median DoR was 21 months (range, 5
months to 28 months).
DISCUSSION
This final report included 18 additional patients and a
more extensive follow-up period than the interim report.1
The ORR in the current study (26%) was only slightly
lower than the rate that was reported in the interim report

(30%).1 The ORR in the subgroup of patients with refractory/recurrent TCL was 24%, which is comparable to the
ORR of patients with recurrent/refractory PTCL who
were treated with lenalidomide monotherapy in the
EXPECT trial (22%).7 This response rate is comparable
to other investigated monotherapies for patients with refractory/recurrent PTCL. The histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin (ORR, 25%),20 the histone deacetylase
inhibitor belinostat (ORR, 25%),21 and the folate analog
pralatrexate (ORR, 29%)22 have all been approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for recurrent/refractory PTCL. Denileukin diftitox, a fusion protein of IL-2
and diphtheria toxin, has been reported to have an ORR
of 48%.23 Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate that was reported to have an ORR of
41%.24 Bendamustine was found to have an ORR of
50%.25 Alisertib is an aurora A kinase inhibitor and was
reported to have a response rate of 50% in TCLs.26

Figure 4. Greatest change in tumor size is shown in patients

products of the longest perpendicular dimensions. The

before the first response assessment. The patients labeled
with an asterisk (*) had an increase in tumor size of >150%.

Making comparisons between these studies is difficult due to their small size and differing assessment methods. The size of studies directed at PTCL ranged from 25
patients21 to 130 patients.20 The larger studies, which
involved pralatrexate22 and romidepsin,20 used independent central review committees to assess response, whereas
the remaining studies, including the presented study,
were assessed by investigators. The wide variety of therapeutic strategies presented by these treatments is encouraging. Lenalidomide could be studied in combination
with some of these other agents to take advantage of multiple mechanisms of action. Lenalidomide, by virtue of
being dosed orally and with a manageable side effect profile, is a well-tolerated drug that could be used in a combination treatment or after remission as a maintenance
therapy. Lenalidomide was used in combination with
bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with
721

Original Article

refractory angioimmunoblastic TCL.27 In these 2 cases,
treatment with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone produced a CR and PR, respectively, with no grade
3 or 4 AEs reported.27 There has been a reported phase
1/2 study of lenalidomide therapy in combination with
vorinostat and dexamethasone,28 but the maximum tolerated dose was only 5 mg/day due to patients experiencing
grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 4 stroke. The ORR
was 25%, the PFS was 2.2 months, and the OS was 6.7
months, which presented no clinical benefit over lenalidomide monotherapy.28
The current study included 8 patients who did not
receive prior chemotherapy, the median number of prior
therapies was 1, and only 16% of patients had undergone
a stem cell transplant. The previously untreated patients
in the current study were generally believed to be too frail
for aggressive first-line combination chemotherapy. The
response rate and duration in this small subset is encouraging and suggests that lenalidomide could potentially be
a good alternative to aggressive combination chemotherapy for these patients. The significant relationship noted
between increased age and likelihood of a response to
therapy (P 5 .0164) was believed to be explained by the
finding that older patients were less likely to have received
prior therapies and the response rate in patients without
prior treatment was higher (ORR, 50%).
There has been a wide range of DoRs reported in the
studies of patients with recurrent and refractory PTCL.
The DoR of lenalidomide monotherapy was 5 months in
the patients with recurrent/refractory disease in the current study. Romidepsin has been reported to have a median DoR of 17 months,20 and belinostat had a median
DoR of 159 days.21 Treatment with pralatrexate demonstrated a DoR of 10.1 months.22 Bendamustine had a
DoR of 3.5 months.25 DoR was not reported in the trial
of denileukin diftitox in patients with PTCL.23
The patients’ responses to lenalidomide therapy have
been heterogeneous, as exemplified by the DoRs ranging
from 2 months to 37 months in the current trial. There
may be molecular tools that could be used to differentiate
likely responders to lenalidomide treatment from nonresponders. In the treatment of multiple myeloma, it has been
reported that the expression of the protein cereblon was
essential for the effectiveness of therapy with immunomodulatory agents.29 There has also been particular attention
paid to lenalidomide therapy in patients with angioimmunoblastic TCL.7,27,30 The response rate of patients with
angioimmunoblastic TCL was 33% in the current
study, 31% in the EXPECT trial,7 and a CR was reportedly
achieved in a heavily pretreated case in Italy.30
722

Angioimmunoblastic TCL accounts for 18.5% of TCL
cases.31 The 5-year survival rate of patients with angioimmunoblastic TCL is reported to be only 32%32 due to an
aggressive course of disease. There could be more promise
for lenalidomide treatment among these patients.
In the interim report of the current study, there was
a significant association noted between the development
of a skin rash and response to lenalidomide monotherapy.1 It has been reported that lenalidomide causes a rash
in approximately 30% of patients.33,34 The association
between developing a rash and responding to lenalidomide therapy was not found to be statistically significant
(P 5 .0685), but the trend toward significance remained.
Rash could be an early predictor of response. Rash onset
in patients with multiple myeloma and amyloidosis typically occurs within the first month of treatment.33
Lenalidomide is a drug with proven clinical efficacy
in various malignancies as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics. The safety profile of
lenalidomide is also good as both monotherapy and in
combination treatments.35 Lenalidomide is also a potential drug for maintenance therapy after remission induction because of its oral dosing and tolerable side effect
profile. Further investigations are warranted for its use as
part of combination therapy for TCL and as a maintenance therapy. Efforts to better understand which subset
of patients with TCL benefit the most from therapy with
lenalidomide also may be worthwhile.
