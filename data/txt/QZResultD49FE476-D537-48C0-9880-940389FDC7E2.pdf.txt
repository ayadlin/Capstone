Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed or
malignant cells, thus exhibiting potential as a tumor-selective
apoptosis-inducing cytokine for cancer treatment. Many
studies have shown that the apoptosis-inducing activity of
TRAIL can be enhanced by various cancer therapeutic agents.
R115777 (tipifarnib) is the first farnesyltransferase inhibitor
(FTI) that showed clinical activity in myeloid malignancies.
In general, R115777, like other FTIs, exerts relatively weak
effects on the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells with
undefined mechanism(s). In the current study, we studied its
effects on the growth of human lung cancer cells, including
induction of apoptosis, and examined potential underlying
mechanisms for these effects. We showed that R115777
induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells, in addition to
inducing G1 or G2-M arrest. Moreover, we found that
R115777 up-regulated the expression of death receptor 5
(DR5), an important death receptor for TRAIL, and exhibited
an augmented effect on the induction of apoptosis when
combined with recombinant TRAIL. Blockage of DR5
induction by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the
ability of R115777 to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis,
indicating that R115777 augments TRAIL-induced apoptosis
through up-regulation of DR5 expression. Thus, our findings
show the efficacy of R115777 in human lung cancer cells and
suggest that R115777 may be used clinically in combination
with TRAIL for treatment of human lung cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) receptor death receptor 5 (DR5, also named TRAIL-R2,
TRICK2, or Killer/DR5) is one of the death receptors that share a
similar, cysteine-rich extracellular domain and additional cytoplasmic death domain (1). DR5 locates at the cell surface, becomes
activated or oligomerized (trimerized) upon binding to its ligand
TRAIL or overexpression, and then signals apoptosis through
caspase-8–mediated rapid activation of caspase cascades (1, 2).

Recently, DR5 has attracted much more attention because its
ligand TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed or
malignant cells, thus demonstrating potential as a tumor-selective
apoptosis-inducing cytokine for cancer treatment (3, 4). Certain
cancer therapeutic agents induce the expression of DR5 in cancer
cells and are thereby able to augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis or
initiate apoptosis (5–7).
Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) are a class of agents that
suppress the farnesytltransferase enzyme to prevent certain
proteins such as the Ras oncoprotein from undergoing farnesylation (8–10). These agents inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis
in various types of cancer cell lines in culture or suppress the
growth of xenografts in nude mice with limited toxicity (8–10). In
the clinic, FTIs are well tolerated and have some positive outcomes
in certain settings, such as hematologic malignancies and breast
cancer, although the response rates to FTIs alone are generally
poor. When combined with other therapeutic agents or radiotherapy, FTIs exhibits some encouraging clinical responses (8, 10).
Although FTIs were historically developed as anti-Ras agents, it is
now generally agreed upon that FTIs exert their antitumor activity
independent of their activity on inhibiting Ras farnesylation (8, 9).
Otherwise, the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of
FTIs remain largely undefined.
R115777 is one of the clinically tested FTIs and is the first one to
show clinical activity in myeloid malignancies (11). Preclinical
studies have shown that this agent inhibited the growth of the
majority of tested human cancer cell lines (12), induced apoptosis
in certain types of cancer cells (13–15), and suppressed the
growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice with an increase in
apoptotic index (12, 16). When R115777 was combined with other
therapeutic agents, such as taxol and the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib, enhanced effects on growth inhibition or apoptosis
induction were observed (17–19). Moreover, R115777 was also
effective in inhibiting the growth of chemical-induced lung
carcinogenesis in mice (20), suggesting potential activity as a
chemopreventive agent. In the clinic, the most promising activity
of R115777 has been seen primarily in hematologic malignancies
(8, 11). Although R115777 as a single agent exhibited limited clinical
activity in solid tumors, when used in combination with other
agents such as tamoxifen, it did induce responses in some patients
with solid tumors (8).
In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of FTIinduced growth arrest and apoptosis and to develop mechanismoriented, FTI-based combination regimens for effective treatment
of cancer, we found that R115777 up-regulated DR5 expression,
including causing an increase in cell surface DR5 levels.
Accordingly, R115777 cooperated with TRAIL to enhance induction
of apoptosis in human lung cancer cells. Thus, our findings in this

using the following primers: DR5 sense 5¶-GACCTAGCTCCCCAGCAGAGAG-3¶, DR5 antisense 5¶-CGGCTGCAACTGTGACTCCTAT-3¶, h-actin
sense, 5¶-GAAACTACCTTCAACTCCATC-3¶, and h-actin antisense 5¶-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGGGCC-5¶. The 25-AL amplification
mixture contained 2 AL of cDNA, 0.5 AL of deoxynucleotide triphosphate
(25 mmol/L each), 1 AL each of the sense and antisense primers (20 Amol/L
each), 5 AL of TaqMaster PCR enhancer, 1 AL of Taq DNA polymerase
(5 units/AL; Eppendorf), 2.5 AL 10 reaction buffer, and sterile H2O. PCR
was done for 28 cycles. After an initial step at 95jC for 3 min, each cycle
consisted of 50 s of denaturation at 94jC, 50 s of annealing at 58jC, and 55 s
of extension at 72jC. This was followed by an additional extension step at
72jC for 10 min. The housekeeping gene h-actin was also amplified as an
internal reference. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel, stained, and directly visualized under UV illumination.
Construction of DR5 reporter plasmids, transient transfection, and
luciferase activity assay. The plasmid containing a 5¶-flanking region of
DR5 gene was kindly provided by Dr. G.S. Wu (Wayne State University
School of Medicine, Detroit, MI). We then used this plasmid as a template to
amplify different lengths of the 5¶-flanking region of the DR5 gene by PCR
and then subcloned these fragments, respectively, into pGL3-basic reporter
vector (Promega) through KpnI and BglII restriction sites. In the PCR
amplification, the reverse primer 5¶-CTTAAGATCTGGCGGTAGGGAACGCTCTTATAGTC-3¶ was used to make all deletion constructs. The
upstream primers used were 5¶-CTTAGGTACCTGGCTCGTCTGTTCCTCTACGGCCCC-3¶ ( 3,070), 5¶-CTTAGGTACCTCAACTCATTTCCCCCAAGTTTC-3¶ ( 420), and 5¶-CTTAGGTACCACCCAGAAACAAACCACAGCCCGGG-3¶ ( 373), respectively. These constructs were then named
pGL3-DR5( 3070), pGL3-DR5( 420), and pGL3-DR5( 373), respectively.

For examining the effect of R115777 on DR5 transactivation activity, cells
were seeded in 24-well plates and cotransfected with the given reporter
plasmid (0.5 Ag per well) and pCH110 plasmid encoding h-galactosidase
(h-gal; Pharmacia Biotech; 0.2 Ag per well) using FuGene 6 transfection
reagent (3:1 ratio; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with
R115777. After 12 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase activity
assay using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a luminometer. Relative
luciferase activity was normalized to h-gal activity, which was measured as
described previously (24).
Detection of cell surface DR5. Cell surface DR5 expression was
analyzed using flow cytometry as described previously (25). The mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) that represents antigenic density on a per-cell
basis was used to represent DR5 expression level. Phycoerythrin-conjugated
mouse anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody (DJR2-4), anti-human DR4
monoclonal antibody (DJR1), and mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype
control (MOPC-21/P3) were purchased from eBioscience.
Detection of caspase activation and apoptosis. Caspase activation
and their substrate cleavage were detected by Western blot analysis as
described above. Apoptosis was detected using an annexin V:phycoerythrin Apoptosis Detection kit purchased from BD Biosciences following
the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition, sub-G1 was also measured by
flow cytometry as described previously (26) as another indication of
apoptosis.
Cell survival assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and
treated on the second day with the indicated agents. At the end of
treatment, cell number was estimated by the sulforhodamine B assay as
previously described (27). The cell survival was presented as the percentage

Cell cycle analysis. Cell were seeded in 10-cm-diameter cell culture
dishes and treated on the second day with DMSO control or R115777. At the
end of treatment, cells were trypsinized, and single-cell suspensions were
subjected to staining and subsequent analysis of cell cycle by flow
cytometry as described previously (28).
Silencing of DR5 expression using small interfering RNA. High-purity
control (nonsilencing) and DR5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos were
described previously (23) and synthesized from Qiagen. The transfection of
siRNA was conducted in a 24-well plate (1 Ag per well) using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent purchased from Invitrogen following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells
were treated with R115777 alone, TRAIL alone, and their combination.
Gene-silencing effect was evaluated by Western blot analysis, and apoptosis
was measured with annexin V staining.

Results
R115777 effectively inhibits the growth of human lung
cancer cells through induction of apoptosis and growth arrest.
The effects of R115777 on the growth of human lung cancer cells
have not been systemically evaluated. Therefore, we examined the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

effects of R115777 on the growth of a panel of human non–small
cell lung cancer cells by different assays. R115777 effectively
inhibited the growth of six tested cell lines by measuring cell
number, with IC50s ranging from 2 to 6 Amol/L after a 3-day
exposure (Fig. 1A). Under normal culture condition (i.e., 5% FBS),
R115777 in general was a weak inducer of apoptosis because it
induced apoptosis in some cell lines (e.g., H358 and H1299) but not
in others (e.g., A549 and H157). However, under low-serum (i.e.,
0.1%) culture conditions, the effects of R115777 on apoptosis
induction were substantially enhanced in all of the tested cell lines.
Under both culture conditions, A549 and H157 were relatively
resistant to R115777-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In addition to
induction of apoptosis, R115777 induced cell cycle arrest either at
the G1 phase (i.e., H157, A549, and H1299) or at the G2-M phase (i.e.,
H460, H1792, and H358), indicating that R115777 induces growth
arrest. Collectively, these results show that R115777 inhibits the
growth of human lung cancer cells through the induction of
apoptosis and/or growth arrest.
R115777 induces DR5 expression in human lung cancer cells.
To understand the mechanism by which R115777 induces apoptosis,
we screened its effects on the expression of certain genes related to
apoptosis. Our preliminary results indicate that DR5 is a gene upregulated in cells exposed to R115777. Therefore, we did detailed
experiments to study the effects of R115777 on the expression of DR5
in a panel of human lung cancer cells. We found that R115777 at
concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 Amol/L increased DR5 protein
levels in a concentration-dependent manner. The most dramatic
increase in DR5 levels post–R115777 exposure were observed in
H1792 cells and H1299 cell lines (Fig. 2A). R115777 induced a weak
increase in DR5 levels in H157 cells. Time course analysis indicated
that R115777 started to increase DR5 levels at 3 h, which was
sustained up to 24 h (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, the
farnesylation of HDJ-2 protein was apparently inhibited (Fig. 2A
and B), indicating that R115777 indeed inhibits protein farnesylation in the tested cell lines. Moreover, we determined whether
R115777 up-regulated DR5 at the transcriptional level. R115777
increased not only DR5 mRNA levels evaluated by RT-PCR
(Fig. 2C), but also the luciferase activity of the cells transfected
with reporter plasmids with different lengths of the 5¶-flanking
region of the DR5 gene ranging from 3,070 to 373 bp upstream of
the translation start site (Fig. 2D). These results show that
R115777 induces DR5 expression at the transcriptional level.
R115777 induces cell surface DR5 distribution. Because DR5
is a functional protein on the cell surface, we then analyzed cell
surface DR5 levels in cells exposed to R115777. As shown in Fig. 3A,
both H1792 and H157 cells treated with R115777 exhibited
increased fluorescent intensity of DR5 staining in comparison with
DMSO-treated cells (i.e., DR5 staining peak shifted to the right).
The MFIs in both H1792 and H157 cells were increased close to
4-fold over those in DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 3B). These results
clearly indicate that R115777 increases the amounts of DR5 on the
cell surface. We also analyzed the effects of R115777 on the
distribution of cell surface DR4, a protein with similar functions to
DR5, in these cell lines. R115777 increased cell surface DR4 in H157
cells (1.95-fold), but only minimally in H1792 cells (1.32-fold; Fig. 3).
Thus, these results indicate that R115777 primarily increases cell
surface DR5 in human lung cancer cells.
R115777 cooperates with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in
human lung cancer cells. Because R115777 increases cell surface
DR5, we hypothesized that R115777 would sensitize cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the effects of the

Induction of DR5 by R115777

combination of R115777 and TRAIL on cell survival and apoptosis
in human lung cancer cells. As presented in Fig. 4A, the
combination of R115777 and TRAIL worked better than each
single agent in decreasing cell survival. Accordingly, the combination was more potent than each single agent in inducing apoptosis
estimated by annexin V staining (Fig. 4B). For example, R115777 at
5 Amol/L and TRAIL at 20 ng/mL alone induced 11.5% and 22.4%
of cells to undergo apoptosis, respectively, whereas their combination induced 40% of cells to undergo apoptosis. Thus, it seems that
the combination of R115777 and TRAIL synergistically induces
apoptosis. Moreover, we examined the effects of R115777 and
TRAIL combination on the activation of caspase cascades. R115777
alone at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 Amol/L did not
cause cleavage of the tested caspases. TRAIL alone at 20 ng/mL
weakly induced cleavage of caspases and caspase-3 substrates,
PARP, and RasGAP. However, their combinations exhibited
enhanced effects on cleavage of these proteins (Fig. 4C). As the

concentrations of R115777 in the combinations were increased, the
cleavage of the caspases and related proteins were more
pronounced. Thus, the combination of R115777 and TRAIL
augments activation of caspases, further indicating that R115777
cooperates with TRAIL to induce apoptosis.
R115777 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through upregulation of DR5. To determine whether R115777 enhances
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR5 up-regulation, we examined
the effects of R115777 and TRAIL combination on apoptosis
induction in cells where DR5 expression was silenced with DR5
siRNA. In control siRNA-transfected cells, R115777 increased DR5
levels (Fig. 5A, lane 2). In DR5 siRNA-transfected cells, the basal
levels of DR5 were reduced (Fig. 5A, lane 5) and not increased
further by R115777 (Fig. 5A, lane 6). These results indicate a
successful silencing of DR5 expression. By apoptotic assay, we
detected up to 70% apoptotic cells in control siRNA-transfected
cells, but only 28% apoptotic cells in DR5 siRNA-transfected cells

Figure 4. Combination of R115777 and TRAIL exerts augmented effects on decreasing cell survival (A ), inducing apoptosis (B), and activating caspases (C). A, the
indicated cell lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of R115777 alone, 25 ng/mL TRAIL alone, and their respective combinations as indicated. After
24 h, cell number was estimated using sulforhodamine B assay for calculation of cell survival; B, H157 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of R115777
alone, 20 ng/mL TRAIL alone, and their respective combinations as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were harvested for measurement of apoptosis using annexin
V staining. The percent positive cells in the top right and bottom right quadrants were added to yield the total of apoptotic cells. The cells in the bottom left quadrant were
surviving cells; C, H157 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of R115777 alone, 20 ng/mL TRAIL alone, and their respective combinations for 16 h.
The cells were then subjected to preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis for detecting cleavage of caspases and their substrates.

upon treatment with R115777 and TRAIL combination (Fig. 5B).
Collectively, these results clearly indicate that up-regulation of DR5
is a key event that mediates augmentation of apoptosis induced by
the combination of R115777 and TRAIL. We noted that more
apoptotic cells were detected in control siRNA-transfected H157
cells treated with either TRAIL or the combination of R115777 and
TRAIL compared with the result presented in Fig. 4B generated
from the same cell line exposed to the similar treatment. In
another transfection experiments, we generated identical results
from control siRNA-transfected H157 cells treated with the same
combination. Therefore, it is possible that the transfected cells are
somehow more susceptible than their parental cells to undergo
apoptosis upon treatment with TRAIL or the combination of
R115777 and TRAIL. Of course, the discrepancy may also be caused
by varied activities of different batches of recombinant TRAIL.
R115777 modulates c-FLIP expression in a cell line–
dependent manner. c-FLIP including FLIPL and FLIPS are key
proteins that negatively regulate the extrinsic death receptor–
mediated apoptotic pathway by inhibiting caspase-8 activation
(29). Some cancer therapeutic agents enhance cell sensitivity to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis via down-regulation of c-FLIP expression
(30–33). Therefore, we further examined the effects of R115777 on
c-FLIP expression in human lung cancer cells. In H1792 cells,
R115777 at the given concentrations decreased the levels of both
FLIPL and FLIPS. However, R115777 slightly increased the levels of
both forms of c-FLIP in H157 and A549 cells. We detected neither
basal levels of c-FLIP nor clear modulation by R115777 in H1299
cells (Fig. 6A). Thus, it seems that R115777 exerts a cell line–
dependent modulation of c-FLIP in human lung cancer cells.
Enforced expression of exogenous c-FLIP protects cells
from apoptosis induced by the combination of R115777 and
TRAIL. Because the combination of R115777 and TRAIL still
augmented apoptosis in the H157 cell line, in which c-FLIP levels
were increased, we examined whether enforced expression of
exogenous c-FLIP inhibited apoptosis induced by the combination
of R115777 and TRAIL. By means of lentiviral infection, we
established a stable H157 cell line that expressed high levels of

exogenous FLIPL (Fig. 6B). In Lac Z (control)–transfected cell line,
we detected f2%, 10%, 14%, and 42% annexin V–positive
(apoptotic) cells from cells treated with DMSO, R115777, TRAIL,
and the combination of R115777 and TRAIL, respectively. However,
annexin V–positive cells were f2%, 3%, 2%, and 6% in FLIPLtransfected H157 cells treated with DMSO, R115777, TRAIL, and
the combination of R115777 and TRAIL, respectively (Fig. 6C).
These results clearly indicate that enforced expression of FLIPL
abolished apoptosis induced by R115777 and TRAIL.

Discussion
The effects of R115777 on the growth including apoptosis and
cell cycle distribution of human lung cancer cells have not been
fully evaluated in a preclinical setting. In this study, we show that
R115777, at a clinically achievable and safe concentration range
(2–6 Amol/L; refs. 34–37), effectively inhibited the growth of
human lung cancer cells, primarily through inducing growth arrest
and apoptosis. In general, R115777 was not a potent inducer of
apoptosis under normal serum culture condition, although its
apoptosis-inducing effects could be substantially enhanced by lowserum culture condition. Moreover, R115777 induced cell cycle
arrest either at the G1 phase or at the G2-M phase depending on cell
lines. All of these phenomena are consistent with those observed
from other FTIs (26, 38, 39).
In this study, we show, for the first time, that R115777 induces
DR5 expression not only at protein levels but also at mRNA levels.
Moreover, R115777 increased transactivation of the DR5 promoter,
indicating that R115777 modulates DR5 expression at the
transcriptional level. In addition, we showed that R115777
increased amounts of DR5 at the cell surface, indicating that
R115777 induces cell surface DR5 distribution. We noted that
R115777 exerted only a moderate effect on modulation of DR5
protein levels in H157 cells (Fig. 1A). However, it increased cell
surface DR5 in H157 cells as strongly as in H1792 cells (Fig. 3).
These results suggest that R115777 induces DR5 redistribution at
the cell surface in addition to increasing DR5 expression.

Figure 5. Silencing of DR5 expression by siRNA (A) attenuates apoptosis induced by the combination of R115777 and TRAIL (B). H157 cells were seeded in a 24-well
cell culture plate and on the second day transfected with control (Ctrl ) or DR5 siRNA. Forty hours later, the cells were treated with 10 Amol/L R115777, 20 ng/mL
TRAIL, and their combination. After 15 h, the cells were harvested for preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis (A ) or for detection
of apoptotic cells using annexin V staining (B). In annexin V assay, the percent positive cells in the top right and bottom right quadrants were added to yield the
total of apoptotic cells. The cells in the bottom left quadrant were surviving cells.

Induction of DR5 by R115777

Figure 6. Differential effects of R115777 on c-FLIP levels (A ) and protection of enforced c-FLIP expression (B ) on apoptosis induced by the combination of R115777
and TRAIL (C ). A, the indicated cell lines were treated with the given concentrations of R115777. After 16 h, the cells were subjected to preparation of whole-cell
protein lysates and subsequent Western blot analysis. B, whole-cell protein lysates were prepared from H157 cells transfected with Lac Z and FLIPL, respectively,
and then subjected to detection of FLIPL expression by Western blot analysis. C, H157-Lac Z-5 or H157-FLIPL-6 cells were treated with DMSO, 10 Amol/L R115777,
5 ng/mL TRAIL, and the combination of R115777 and TRAIL, respectively. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to detection of apoptotic cells using
annexin V staining. The percent positive cells in the top right and bottom right quadrants were added to yield the total of apoptotic cells. The cells in the bottom left
quadrant were surviving cells.

In addition to R115777, we found that another FTI called
SCH66336 (lonafarnib) also induced DR5 expression and cell surface
DR5 distribution.3 Both agents have farnesyltransferase-inhibitory
activity; however, they have distinct chemical structures. In our
study, R115777 rapidly increased DR5 expression at 3 h posttreatment, which was accompanied by inhibition of HDJ-2 protein
farnesylation (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we suggest that DR5 up-regulation
by R115777 is associated with its ability to inhibit protein farnesylation. Because R115777 functions like SCH66336 to increase
DR5 mRNA as well, it is unlikely that R115777 directly modulates
DR5 protein. Rather, it may inhibit the farnesylation of an unknown
protein, leading to increased DR5 transcription. Nevertheless, our
findings on R115777 as well as SCH66336 warrant further study on
the relationship between protein farnesylation and DR5 modulation.
Preliminary results from clinical trials have shown that R115777
exhibits promising efficacy in hematologic malignancies with a
favorable toxicity profile (8, 11). R115777, at a clinically achievable
and safe concentration range (2–6 Amol/L; refs. 34–37), up-regulated

DR5 expression and induced cell surface DR5 distribution. Accordingly, we showed that the combination of a clinically achievable
concentration of R115777 with TRAIL exhibited augmented effects
on decreasing cell survival and inducing apoptosis (Fig. 4). Given that
TRAIL is considered as a cancer-selective cytokine with cancer
therapeutic potential and is being tested in phase I clinical trails, our
current finding that R115777 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis
clearly has translational significance in the clinic.
Some studies have shown that certain cancer therapeutic agents
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis via down-regulation of c-FLIP
expression (30–32, 40). In our study, we found that R115777 induced
DR5 expression and cell surface distribution in all of the tested cell
lines. However, it modulated c-FLIP expression in a cell line–
dependent manner. R115777 even slightly increased c-FLIP levels in
some cell lines (e.g., H157), whereas it decreased c-FLIP expression in
other cell lines (e.g., H1792). Regardless of the differential modulation
of c-FLIP expression, the combination of R115777 and TRAIL exerted
augmented effects on decreasing cell survival and inducing apoptosis
in these lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that it is unlikely for R115777
to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis via modulation of c-FLIP levels
in certain cell lines in which c-FLIP levels are not decreased. Through

silencing DR5 expression and blocking DR5 induction by R115777
using siRNA targeting DR5, our data clearly show that apoptosis
induced by the combination of R115777 and TRAIL was substantially
attenuated. This result thus indicates that R115777 enhances TRAILinduced apoptosis primarily via up-regulation of DR5.
Our results show that the combination of R115777 and TRAIL
augmented induction of apoptosis in H157 cells, in which c-FLIP
levels were actually increased upon R115777 treatment. When
FLIPL expression was enforced to high levels in this cell line, either
TRAIL alone or the combination of R115777 and TRAIL failed to
induce apoptosis, indicating that FLIPL overexpression indeed
inhibits TRAIL/death receptor–mediated apoptosis. Therefore, we
suggest that R115777-induced DR5 expression and cell surface
distribution override c-FLIP up-regulation, leading to enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cell lines where c-FLIP expression is
high or increased by R115777. If this is correct, we assume that cell
lines in which c-FLIP levels are reduced upon R115777 treatment
(e.g., H1792) will be more susceptible than other cell lines where
c-FLIP expression is increased or not altered by R115777
(e.g., H157) to apoptosis induction by the combination of
R115777 and TRAIL as shown in Fig. 4A.

Among the tested lung cancer cell lines, A549 and H157 cell lines
are the least sensitive to R115777-induced apoptosis even under
low-serum culture condition (Fig. 1C). We noted that these two cell
lines had relatively higher levels of c-FLIP compared with H1792
and H1299 cells (Fig. 6A), which are sensitive to R115777-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Whether these results suggest that the levels of
c-FLIP determine cell sensitivity to R115777-induced apoptosis
needs to be investigated in the future.
In summary, we have shown that R115777 increases DR5
expression, induces DR5 distribution at the cell surface, and
subsequently enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings
warrant clinical evaluation of the efficacy of R115777 and TRAIL in
the treatment of human lung and other types of cancer in the future.
