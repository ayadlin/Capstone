ABSTRACT
Obesity and related metabolic abnormalities play a key role in liver carcinogenesis.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is often complicated with obesity and
diabetes mellitus, is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Sodium alginate (SA), which is extracted from brown seaweeds, is marketed
as a weight loss supplement because of its high viscosity and gelling properties. In
the present study, we examined the effects of SA on the progression of NASH and
related liver carcinogenesis in monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated mice, which
show obesity, diabetes mellitus, and NASH-like histopathological changes. Male MSGmice were intraperitoneally injected with diethylnitrosamine at 2 weeks of age, and,
thereafter, they received a basal diet containing high- or low-molecular-weight SA
throughout the experiment (16 weeks). At sacriﬁce, control MSG-treated mice fed
the basal-diet showed signiﬁcant obesity, hyperinsulinemia, steatosis and hepatic
tumor development. SA administration suppressed body weight gain; improved insulin
sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia; attenuated inﬂammation in the
liver and white adipose tissue; and inhibited hepatic lipogenesis and progression of
NASH. SA also reduced oxidative stress and increased anti-oxidant enzyme levels in
the liver. Development of hepatic tumors, including liver cell adenoma and HCC, and
hepatic pre-neoplastic lesions was signiﬁcantly inhibited by SA supplementation.
In conclusion, oral SA supplementation improves liver steatosis, insulin resistance,
chronic inﬂammation, and oxidative stress, preventing the development of liver
tumorigenesis in obese and diabetic mice. SA may have ability to suppress steatosisrelated liver carcinogenesis in obese and diabetic subjects.

levels of oxidative stress and aberrant lipogenesis in the
liver, both of which are signiﬁcantly linked to obesity and
metabolic syndrome, are also dominantly observed during
liver carcinogenesis and HCC progression [5, 6].
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome,
and a proportion of patients with this disease can show
progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
the risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC [7]. Amelioration
of obesity, insulin resistance, and steatosis and reduction
of oxidative stress are critical steps for inhibiting the
development of NASH [8]. A recent clinical trial showed
that treatment with vitamin E, an anti-oxidant, signiﬁcantly

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious healthcare
problem worldwide because of its increasing morbidity
and high mortality. Chronic inﬂammation of the liver and
subsequent cirrhosis are the strongest risk factors for HCC
development. Recent evidence also indicates that obesity and
related metabolic abnormalities, especially diabetes mellitus
and insulin resistance, increase the risk of HCC [1–3].
Obesity promotes hepatic steatosis and inﬂammation through
the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, which are
closely associated with liver carcinogenesis [4, 5]. Increased

SA were signiﬁcantly lower than those of SA-untreated
control mice at the termination of the experiment, 21
weeks of age (Table 1; P < 0.05). Relative weights of WAT
of SA-treated mice were higher than those of untreated
mice (P < 0.05). During the experiment, SA showed
no clinical symptoms of toxicity. Histopathological
examinations also revealed the absence of toxicity due
to SA in the liver, kidney, and spleen (data not shown).
No signiﬁcant difference was seen in the amount of food
ingested by all groups during the experiment.

improved hepatic histopathology in patients with NASH
[9]. Therefore, in addition to lifestyle modiﬁcation to
reduce body weight, active pharmacotherapy is considered
necessary for the management of patients with NASH,
especially those who have the metabolic syndrome.
Recent preclinical and clinical studies have
demonstrated that targeting obesity and related metabolic
abnormalities, such as attenuation of chronic inﬂammation
and improvement of insulin resistance, may be an
effective strategy for preventing liver carcinogenesis in
obese individuals[10, 11]. We have previously reported
that supplementation with branched chain amino acids
(BCAA), which prevents HCC development in cirrhotic
patients with obesity [3], signiﬁcantly inhibits liver
carinogenesis in obese and diabetic mice by improving
insulin resistance and attenuating chronic inﬂammation in
both the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) [12, 13].
Alginate is a gelling polysaccharide and a structural
component extracted from marine brown algae. Alginate
provides mechanical strength and ﬁexibility in seaweed,
and the ﬁber is composed of mannuronic and guluronic
acids, which inﬂuence its viscous physiological properties.
For decades, the food industry has widely used alginates as
additives because of their gelling, viscosifying, and stabilizing
properties [14]. Ingestion of sodium alginate (SA), the most
commonly used alginate, and subsequent gelation in the
stomach appear to decrease the human appetite in acute
settings [15]. An important rheological property of ﬁbers
within the intestine is viscosity, which is thought to account
for the beneﬁcial physiological responses in relation to appetite
regulation [15], as well as glycemic and lipidemic control [16].
SA supplementation decreases body weight and
improves obesity [17], which suggests that SA may be
effective in the treatment of metabolic disorders as well as
the overall symptoms of the metabolic syndrome caused by
obesity. However, effects of SA on the inhibition of obesityand NASH-related liver carcinogenesis have not yet been
studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate
whether SA supplementation would signiﬁcantly inhibit
hepatic carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced
liver tumorigenesis in monosodium glutamate (MSG)treated mice, which is a model animal that shows obesity,
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus and reﬂects steatosisrelated liver carcinogenesis in human [18–20], by focusing
on its anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, anti-inﬂammatory, and
anti-oxidant effects. Moreover, since SA used in previous
investigations is usually high-molecular-weight SA, we
examine and compare the effects of low-molecular-weight
SA, which is considered relatively easy to administer orally.

Effects of SA on DEN-induced liver
tumorigenesis in MSG mice
Nodular lesions (liver cell adenoma and HCC)
and FCA (Figure 1A) were observed in the liver of the
experimental mice in all groups at the end of the study.
However, as listed in Table 2, treatment with lowmolecular-weight SA signiﬁcantly reduced the incidence
of HCC and multiplicity of FCA and liver cell adenoma
(P < 0.05). Incidence and multiplicity of adenoma were
also signiﬁcantly decreased in the liver of mice treated
with high-molecular-weight SA (P < 0.05).

Effects of SA on hepatic histopathology
and hepatic triglyceride levels in the
experimental mice
Results of H&E and Oil-red O-staining of the
livers of the experimental mice are presented in Figure
1B. Inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and ballooning
degeneration of hepatocytes were observed in the MSGtreated mice. Examination of Oil-red O-stained sections
revealed severe hepatic steatosis in SA-untreated control
mice, but it was markedly improved by SA administration.
Similar to the histological ﬁndings, intrahepatic TG levels
were also signiﬁcantly reduced by SA administration
(Figure 1C, P < 0.05). Hepatic steatosis, lobular
inﬂammation, ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, and
NAS were also signiﬁcantly lower in the high-molecularweight SA-supplemented mice than in the SA-untreated
mice (Figure 1D, P < 0.05). No obvious liver ﬁbrosis was
seen in all groups.

Effects of SA on expression levels of FAS, SREBP1c,
PPAR-α, TNF-α, IL-1β, F4/80, and CCL2 mRNAs
in the liver of the experimental mice
Because hepatic steatosis and lobular inﬂammation
were improved by SA administration (Figure 1B, 1C,
and 1D), effects of SA on expression levels of speciﬁc
molecules that control hepatic lipid metabolism and
inﬂammation were examined. High- and low-moleculaweight SA-treated mice showed signiﬁcant decrease
in expression levels of FAS and SREBP1c mRNAs
(Figure 2A, P < 0.05), which are involved in fatty acid

PPAR-α, an entry ﬂux of fatty acid regulator [21], were
increased by SA administration (P < 0.05). In addition, SA
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased mRNA expression levels

effectively increased by high-molecular-weight SA

Inﬂammation in the adipose tissue plays a key
role in the pathophysiology of obesity [24]. Therefore,
we checked whether SA treatment attenuates chronic
inﬂammation in WAT. As shown in Figure 4, expression
levels of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs in the WAT were
signiﬁcantly reduced by SA treatment (P < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

In addition, treatment with SA markedly inhibited mRNA
expression of F4/80 and CCL2 (P < 0.05), which plays a
role in the recruitment of macrophages into obese adipose
tissue [24, 25].

Obesity and related metabolic abnormalities,
especially diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, are
critically associated with the development of NAFLD
and NASH. These pathophysiological conditions have
also been shown to increase the risk of HCC [1–3]. To
investigate the preventive effects of SA on the development
of obesity-related liver carcinogenesis, MSG-treated mice
were selected for the present study because they show
signiﬁcant obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and NASH-like
histology, which is virtually undistinguishable from those
in humans. Furthermore, the MSG-treated mice were
assumed to show high incidence and multiplicity of liver
tumors when they were administered DEN [20, 26–28].

Effects of SA on serum parameters and insulin
sensitivity in the experimental mice
Serum levels of AST and ALT were signiﬁcantly
decreased in SA-treated mice (Table 3, P < 0.05). SA
treatment markedly decreased serum level of insulin
and increased the value of QUICKI, which indicates that
insulin resistance is improved by this agent (P < 0.05).
Serum leptin levels were also signiﬁcantly decreased by
high-molecular-weight SA administration (P < 0.05).

Several rodent studies have revealed that intervention
using anti-metabolic agents may be an effective strategy for
preventing obesity- and NASH-related liver carcinogenesis
[10, 11]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
SA for this purpose because it is expected to have beneﬁcial
effects on appetite regulation and serum levels of glucose
and insulin [15, 29, 30]. Oncogenic effects of insulin, such as
stimulation of cell proliferation, on HCC have been reported
[31, 32]. In this study, it was considered that suppression
of liver tumorigenesis in the obese and diabetic mice was
due to, at least in part, reduction of serum insulin levels and
improvement in insulin sensitivity. Several animal studies
have suggested that targeting higher serum insulin levels
and insulin resistance is an effective strategy for inhibiting
obesity- and diabetes-related liver tumorigenesis [12, 26].
For instance, dietary supplementation with BCAA, which
improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in chronic
liver disease patients [33], signiﬁcantly suppresses liver
tumorigenesis in obese and diabetic mice by decreasing
serum insulin levels as well as improving insulin sensitivity
[12]. BCAA supplementation also reduced the risk for

HCC in obese patients with liver cirrhosis [3], which
demonstrates the clinical signiﬁcance of lowering insulin
levels and attenuating insulin resistance in the prevention of
liver carcinogenesis in obese and diabetic patients.
Hepatic steatosis, which is involved in liver
tumorigenesis [34], was signiﬁcantly suppressed by SA
administration in the present study. These ﬁndings are
signiﬁcant because improvement in steatosis may be a
key mechanism of speciﬁc agents that inhibit obesityand NASH-related hepatocarcinogenesis [12, 26, 27,
35]. Recent studies have demonstrated that hepatic
de novo lipogenesis is increased in NAFLD as a result
of overexpression of SREBP-1c, which is an important
transcription factor that up-regulates genes such as FAS,
and this promotes fatty acid and TG syntheses [21].
In addition, the hepatic fatty acid oxidative pathway
is considered to be a pathophysiological effect in the
development of NAFLD [21]. Because the entry ﬂux
of fatty acids into mitochondria is regulated by PPAR-α
[36, 37], SA attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation and
inhibited fatty acid synthesis through the suppression of

FAS and SREBP1c mRNA expression and upregulation of
PPAR-α mRNA expression in the present study.
In the present study, hepatic lobular inﬂammation
and hepatic mRNA expression levels of inﬂammatory
mediators such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β,F4/80, and CCL2
were decreased in SA-treated mice. SA administration
also signiﬁcantly attenuated chronic inﬂammation in
WAT of the MSG-treated mice. Macrophage inﬁltration
into WAT, which is accompanied by IL-6 and TNF-α
production, is an early contributing event for the
development of chronic low-grade systemic inﬂammation
[38, 39]. CCL2 plays a crucial role in the recruitment
of macrophages into WAT [24, 25] and upregulation of
TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL2 in WAT is critically involved

in the induction of systemic insulin resistance [38, 39].
Therefore, inhibition of enhanced inﬂammation in both
the liver and adipose tissue by SA supplementation is
important in preventing the development of steatosis and
subsequent liver tumorigenesis in obese mice. In addition
to anti-inﬂammatory properties, anti-oxidative effects
of SA contribute to suppression of obesity-related liver
carcinogenesis because hepatic oxidative stress and lipid
peroxidation are implicated in the progression of steatosis
to NASH and HCC development [22, 23].
Previous studies have explored the importance of
alginate viscosity for the anti-metabolic properties. SA
is expected to have beneﬁcial effects on postprandial
insulinemia because of its high viscosity and gelling

properties [30]. Reduction in food intake and suppression
of body weight gain after administration of high-viscosity
SA, compared to low-viscosity SA, were observed in a
previous study [40, 41]. In rats fed a diet supplemented with
cholesterol and bile acids, high-viscosity SA administration
reduced cholesterol levels, whereas low-viscosity SA did not
[41]. In the present study, however, low-molecular-weight
SA administration sufﬁciently attenuated inﬂammation
in both the liver and WAT and suppressed obesity-related
liver tumorigenesis. These ﬁndings suggest that the lowmolecular-weight SA used in this study is sufﬁcient for
obtaining these beneﬁcial effects; however, further studies
are required to determine the appropriate viscosity of SA,
especially considering the clinical use of this agent.
In terms of SA-induced body weight reduction, it
can be generally caused by reduced food intake [40, 41].
There is, however, another report indicating that SA does
not reduce food consumption [42]. The present study also
demonstrates no signiﬁcant difference was seen in the
amount of food intake among groups, but marked reduction
of body weights in SA-treated groups. This means reduction
of body weight gain in SA-treated groups does not come
from reduced food intake, but may come from impaired
absorption or increased energy expenditure. The latter
seems unfavorable because of more fat tissue in SA-treated
groups, although we did not check energy consumption in
this study. Although we also did not check and compare
muscle mass and the amount of fat and protein in stool, it
can be possible that impaired or delayed absorption from
intestines induced by SA might cause altered muscle mass
and altered balance of fat storage; decreased triglyceride in
the liver and increased fat mass in SA-treated groups. In
addition, image analyzing by computed tomography [43]
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

375.9 ± 202.1

could make it possible to compare the mass of muscle,
visceral, and subcutaneous fat tissues.
In summary, SA supplementation appears to
inhibit the progression of NAFLD and development
of liver tumorigenesis. As the previous study indicates
that body weight reduction is considered to lower the
development of neoplastic lesions [44], the major effect
of SA was presumably reducing body weight gain,
which led to improving insulin sensitivity, attenuating
chronic inﬂammation, and decreasing oxidative-stress
as demonstrated in our study. Supplementation with SA
or other weight-reducing agents, therefore, may be an
effective strategy for prevention and/or treatment of
obesity- and diabetes-related liver tumorigenesis. The
results of the present study, together with those of previous
studies [12, 26], further strengthen our hypothesis
that targeting obesity-induced pathologic conditions,
such as insulin resistance, chronic inﬂammation, and
hepatic steatosis, may be effective for preventing liver
carcinogenesis in obese individuals [10, 11].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and chemicals
Male MSG-treated ICR mice, which were produced
by injecting a dose of MSG (4 mg/g body weight)
subcutaneously into newborn ICR mice, were obtained
from the Institute for Animal Reproduction (Ibaraki,
Japan). The mice were humanely maintained at Gifu
University Life Science Research Center in accordance
with the Institutional Animal Care Guidelines. Basal
diet CRF-1 was purchased from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo,

Japan). DEN was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA). Both high- (MW: 1,300,000) and low-molecularweight (MW: 50,000) SA were kindly supplied by Kaigen
Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan). The concentration of SA
used was 5% (w/w), and this was determined on the basis
of previous studies [40, 45]. In clinical practice, 5% SA
is used as an approved medication for the treatment of
digestive tract damaging without serious side effects.

sample was analyzed using the LightCycler Nano (Roche
Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with FastStart
Essential DNA Green Master (Roche Diagnostics).
Parallel ampliﬁcation of GAPDH was used as the internal
control.

Clinical chemistry
Blood samples, which were collected from the
inferior vena cava of the mice at the time of sacriﬁce
after 8 h of fasting, were used for chemical analyses.
Serum levels of TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA), insulin (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan), glucose
(BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA,
USA), adiponectin (Shibayagi), leptin (Shibayagi),
total cholesterol (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan),
triglyceride (TG) (Wako Pure Chemical), and free fatty
acid (FFA) (Wako Pure Chemical) were determined using
enzyme immunoassays, according to the manufacturers’
protocols. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured
using a standard clinical automatic analyzer (type 7180;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Insulin resistance was estimated
by determining the quantitative insulin sensitivity check
index (QUICKI) [48].

Experimental procedure and histopathological
examination
The experimental protocol was approved by the
Institutional Committee of Animal Experiments of Gifu
University. At 2 weeks of age, male MSG-treated ICR
mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of DEN
(100 mg/kg body weight), and the mice were randomly
allocated to 3 groups at 5 weeks of age. The mice in
group 1 (n = 12) were provided with a basal diet until
the end of the experiment, while the mice in group 2 (n
= 12) and group 3 (n = 12) were provided with a basal
diet supplemented with 5% high- and low-molecularweight SA, respectively, until the end of the experiment.
At 21 weeks of age, all mice were sacriﬁced by CO2
asphyxiation to investigate the development of NASH,
hepatic neoplastic lesions (HCC and liver cell adenoma)
and hepatic pre-malignant lesions (foci of cellular
alteration: FCA) [46].
Maximum sagittal sections of 3 sublobes (left lateral
lobe, left medial lobe, and right medial lobe) were used
for histopathological examination. For all experimental
groups, 4 μm-thick sections of formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁnembedded livers were stained with hematoxylin & eosin
(H&E) for conventional histopathology or with Oil-red
O stain to observe liver steatosis. Histological features of
the livers were evaluated using the NAFLD activity score
(NAS) system [47].

Hepatic lipid analysis
After total lipids were extracted from the frozen
livers (approximately 100 mg), TG levels were measured
using the triglyceride E-test kit (Wako Pure Chemical)
[13].

Oxidative stress analysis
Serum hydroperoxide levels, one of the markers for
oxidative stress, were determined using the derivatives of
reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) test (FREE Carpe
Diem; Diacron s.r.l., Grosseto, Italy) [49].

was performed using speciﬁc primers that amplify
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, F4/80, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand
(CCL)2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, glutathione
peroxidase 1 (GPx1), catalase and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes. Sequences
of these primers have been provided in Table S1. Each

All data, which are presented as mean ± SD, were
analyzed using JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to make comparison between the groups.
If ANOVA indicated signiﬁcant differences, the TukeyKramer multiple comparisons test was performed to
compare mean values among the groups. Differences
were considered signiﬁcant when the two-sided P value
was less than 0.05.
