ABSTRACT
ONC201 is the founding member of a novel class of anti-cancer compounds
called imipridones that is currently in Phase II clinical trials in multiple advanced
cancers. Since the discovery of ONC201 as a p53-independent inducer of TRAIL gene
transcription, preclinical studies have determined that ONC201 has anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic effects against a broad range of tumor cells but not normal cells.
The mechanism of action of ONC201 involves engagement of PERK-independent
activation of the integrated stress response, leading to tumor upregulation of
DR5 and dual Akt/ERK inactivation, and consequent Foxo3a activation leading to
upregulation of the death ligand TRAIL. ONC201 is orally active with infrequent dosing
in animals models, causes sustained pharmacodynamic effects, and is not genotoxic.
The first-in-human clinical trial of ONC201 in advanced aggressive refractory solid
tumors confirmed that ONC201 is exceptionally well-tolerated and established the
recommended phase II dose of 625 mg administered orally every three weeks defined
by drug exposure comparable to efficacious levels in preclinical models. Clinical
trials are evaluating the single agent efficacy of ONC201 in multiple solid tumors and
hematological malignancies and exploring alternative dosing regimens. In addition,
chemical analogs that have shown promise in other oncology indications are in preclinical development. In summary, the imipridone family that comprises ONC201
and its chemical analogs represent a new class of anti-cancer therapy with a unique
mechanism of action being translated in ongoing clinical trials.

DISCOVERY OF ONC201

solid tumor cell lines, and single-dose anti-tumor activity
in vivo [1, 2].

ONC201 is a small molecule, chemical compound
referred to as 7-benzyl-4-(2-methylbenzyl)-1,2,6,7,8,9hexahydroimidazo [1,2-a]pyrido [3,4-e]pyrimidin5(1H)-one that is the founding member of the imipridone
class of compounds that share a unique heterocyclic
pharmacophore (Figure 1). The compound was identified
as a candidate anti-cancer lead compound in a luciferase
reporter screen for small molecule p53-independent
inducers of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) gene transcription in (TRAIL-resistant) baxnull HCT116 human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells [1, 2].
As a key effector of the immune-surveillance of cancer,
TRAIL is a protein conditionally expressed on the surface
of immune cells that triggers apoptosis in proximal
tumor cells while not harming normal host cells [3].
Thus, the therapeutic concept that motivated the screen
that identified ONC201 was to identify compounds that
could safely upregulate a natural anti-tumor immune
surveillance and cancer suppression mechanism with a
desirable therapeutic index.
In the screen for TRAIL-inducing compounds,
small molecules with pronounced capability to induce
TRAIL and tumor cell death included ONC201 and the
ER stress-inducing compound breflate, the pro-drug of
Brefeldin A [2]. Interestingly, both ONC201 and breflate
induced TRAIL at 36 to 48 hours post-treatment in
tumor cells, suggesting that this phenomenon may be a
late-stage downstream signaling/effector mechanism.
Comparative studies of the two small molecules revealed
that both compounds are active in vivo and result in
similar downstream signaling that includes dual Akt
and ERK inactivation. However, ONC201 showed high
selectivity of induction of cell death in malignant cells,
unlike breflate that was toxic to normal cells [2]. This
early observation suggested a partial, but not complete
overlap, in mechanism of action between ONC201 and
ER stress-inducing compounds that would be elucidated
subsequently. Referred to as TRAIL-inducing compound
10 (TIC10) based on the phenotype underpinning its
discovery as an anti-tumor agent, ONC201 was selected
as the lead compound for clinical development due to its
favorable therapeutic index, lack of genotoxicity, druglike chemical properties, penetration of the blood-brain
barrier, p53-independent efficacy in a panel of refractory

MECHANISM OF ACTION
The discovery of ONC201 by a phenotypic
cell-based screen, rather than a target structure-based
approach, meant that its precise mechanism of action
(Figure 2) and direct molecular target was unknown at
the time of discovery. The phenotypic screen, however,
allowed for selection of a specific downstream molecular
signaling pathway effect, anti-tumor effects that required
the molecule to engage its target in a cellular context
and trigger transcriptional events that also remained to
be defined. Biochemical studies indicated that ONC201mediated TRAIL upregulation was likely transcriptional
based on observations of increased TRAIL mRNA
levels in ONC201-treated cancer cells. Gene expression
profiling (GEP) studies were performed in ONC201sensitive p53-deficient HCT116 CRC cells at 48 hrs posttreatment to identify transcriptional changes coincident
with TRAIL induction that could point to a common
upstream regulator, e.g. transcription factor [1]. An in
silico analysis of overlap between transcription factors
with binding sites within the TRAIL gene promoter and
potential transcriptional regulators of the mRNA changes
observed in the GEP studies was performed. This crossreferencing suggested that Foxo3a, which possesses a
binding site within the TRAIL gene promoter [4], could
be activated in response to ONC201. Upregulation of
Foxo3a target genes [5] by ONC201 was validated by
RT-PCR and subcellular localization assays revealed
that Foxo3a is indeed activated by ONC201 where it is
translocated into the nucleus to transactivate the TRAIL
gene. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays verified a
dose-dependent increase in the amount of Foxo3a bound
to the TRAIL gene promoter in response to ONC201. Both
ONC201-induced TRAIL and overall anti-tumor efficacy
was partially dependent on Foxo3a, as shown by RNA
interference experiments in CRC models [1].
Evaluation of Foxo3a regulators in cell-based
assays identified the pro-survival kinases Akt and ERK
as synergistic drivers of ONC201-induced Foxo3a
activation and translocation to the nucleus [6]. Further
characterization of this phenomenon revealed that
ONC201 inactivated Akt and ERK indirectly at late time
points post-treatment that preceded downstream TRAIL
induction. Akt and ERK inactivation in response to
ONC201 treatment resulted in decreased phosphorylation
of their enzymatic target sites on Foxo3a, Ser253 and
Ser294, respectively. Dephosphorylation of Foxo3a
presumably permits its release from cytoplasmic 14-33 proteins that normally bind to these phosphorylated
residues, effectively inactivating Foxo3a by cytoplasmic
sequestration. Genetic and pharmacological experiments
validated that Akt and ERK inactivation has a synergistic

effect on activating Foxo3a, TRAIL, and tumor cell death
[1].
To investigate upstream signaling that may drive the
late apoptotic effects of ONC201, GEP time course studies
were undertaken in CRC and, independently, in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines [7, 8]. The GEP results
in HCT116 and RKO CRC cells revealed an 11-gene ER
stress response signature that was upregulated in response
to ONC201 treatment. When investigated prospectively,
this same gene signature was upregulated in Jeko-1 human
mantle cell lymphoma cells in a time-dependent manner in
response to ONC201 as early as 12 hours post-treatment.
Many of these consensus signature genes induced by
ONC201 have been shown to be regulated by ATF4 [9]
and/or possess binding sites for the ATF4 transcriptional
target gene CHOP [10]. ATF4 upregulation generally
promotes apoptosis, in part by regulating the expression
of two pro-apoptotic proteins, CHOP and the CHOPtarget gene DR5 [11, 12]. Both CHOP and DR5 expression
increased in a time-dependent manner with exposure to
ONC201 in the GEP studies. Thus, these observations
consistently suggested that ATF4 is being activated in

tumor cells in response to ONC201 treatment.
To further validate the mechanism of ONC201,
RKO cells with acquired and stable resistance to ONC201
were generated from the ONC201-sensitive parental
cells. ONC201 is unable to induce cell death, or reduce
the cell viability, of these cells with acquired resistance.
Accordingly, ONC201-induced signaling effects related
to the ATF4-pathway and Akt/ERK/Foxo3a/TRAIL
signaling axes were not observed in the resistant cells [8].
Notably, these ONC201-resistant cells still responded to
proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that the mechanism of
resistance resides upstream of ATF4 induction.
ER stress induces ATF4/CHOP through the
integrated stress response (ISR), which evolved to trigger
cell death in response to a range of cellular stresses that
include sustained ER stress, iron deficiency, amino acid
deprivation, or viral infection. ISR induces its effects
by causing increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which is essential in translation
and inactivated by this phosphorylation event. eIF2α
phosphorylation results in a general attenuation of
translation but upregulates translation of ATF4 selectively,

Figure 2: Mechanism of action of ONC201.

which subsequently induces CHOP [10, 13, 14]. In
accordance with activation of ISR, ONC201 induces
phosphorylation of eIF2α, which leads to its anti-cancer
downstream signaling effects. Interestingly, TRB3 is a
negative regulator of Akt that is induced in the ISR [15,
16] and its induction was observed in ONC201 GEP
experiments. TRB3 knockdown prevented ONC201mediated Akt inactivation, providing a link between
ONC201 ISR activation and previously observed Akt
inactivation [8].
Further studies of how ONC201 causes eIF2α
phosphorylation in the ISR revealed a mechanism
that is independent of the ER stress sensor, PERK, and
dependent on the double stranded RNA sensor PKR and
HRI in solid tumor cells [8]. In lymphoma and leukemia
cells, eIF2α phosphorylation was also PERK-independent
but was dependent on GCN2 in the evaluated cell lines.
Furthermore, ONC201-mediated ATF-4 induction resulted
in inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex
(mTORC). Thus, ONC201 activates the ISR through a
trigger that is distinct from proteasome inhibitors used to
treat specific B-cell malignancies [7]. Consistent with the
overlap of effector signaling pathways between ONC201
and proteasome inhibitors, lymphoma and multiple
myeloma are most sensitive to ONC201 in preclinical
in vitro studies with cell lines (Figure 3). Furthermore,
ONC201-induced cell death or growth arrest has been

associated with attenuation of XIAP and cyclin D1
expression, which is a diagnostic feature of mantle cell
lymphoma [8].
Direct cell-free experiments suggest that ONC201
does not directly target kinases, epigenetic modulators,
proteases, bromodomains, phosphodiesterases, or targets
that have been previously associated with activation of
ISR such as the proteasome, proteases, HSP70, HSP90, or
deubiquitinases. Chemical affinity purification approaches
have failed to generate a reproducible binding target
candidate for ONC201, although RNA-binding proteins
have been inconsistently detected. Thus, ONC201
does not engage many of the known cancer drug target
mechanisms but clearly activates the ISR through a trigger
that is distinct from available therapies that impact this
same pathway.
A series of predictive, in silico, in vitro, and clinical
biomarker studies recently determined that ONC201
antagonizes the dopamine receptor D2-like subfamily of
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) [17]. A novel target
prediction algorithm called BANDIT analyzed millions
of data points, including the molecular structure, in vitro
efficacy profile, and bioactivity assay results for ONC201.
The Bayesian machine-learning approach compared
ONC201 with all small molecules with known drug targets
and predicted a highly specific interaction with dopamine
receptor D2 (DRD2) rather than other members of the

family. Experimental GPCR profiling as well as reporter
assays confirmed that ONC201 antagonizes the D2-like,
but not D1-like, subfamily of dopamine receptors. In
addition, ONC201 increased levels of serum prolactin, a
clinical hallmark of DRD2 antagonism, in several patients
from the first-in-human Phase I study. The potential
relevance of this interaction to the antitumor activity of
ONC201 is indicated by a range of preclinical reports that
have demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy effects of D2-like
receptor inhibition in a range of malignancies [18-20].
This molecular interaction is particularly intriguing given
that GPCRs are the targets of a large number of marketed
drugs for many diseases, with oncology being a striking
exception [21].
In summary, ONC201 coordinates a network of
anti-cancer signaling effects through an early-stage ISR
activation in tumor cells (Figure 2) via an apparently
unique trigger that leads to pronounced efficacy without
harming normal cells. This signaling cascade can explain
the previously described late signaling effects of ONC201
such
as
Akt/ERK/Foxo3a/DR5/TRAIL-dependent
apoptosis that has also been reported downstream of ER
stress [22]. The profile of ONC201 suggests that the small
molecule may engage a novel binding target for oncology.

One of the early in vivo efficacy evaluations of oral
ONC201 was in an Eµ-myc transgenic mouse model that
spontaneously causes metastatic myc-driven aggressive
lymphomas by approximately 9 weeks of age [1]. Weekly
oral administration of ONC201 from weeks 9-12 of age
prolonged the median survival of these lymphoma-bearing
mice by 4 weeks. All mice survived while on therapy and
tolerated ONC201 well. A large in vitro efficacy screen
of more than 1,000 human cancer cell lines indicated
that ONC201 had the highest potency in lymphomas and
multiple myeloma (MM) (Figure 3), a finding in agreement
with ISR activation by ONC201. Parallel independent
investigations have revealed that multiple myeloma cells
are relatively sensitive to ONC201, with GI50 values in
the nano-molar range that are an order of magnitude below
other tumor types [23]. In addition, ONC201 induces the
TRAIL pathway and caspase-dependent cell death in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines [24].
ONC201 strongly induces apoptosis in mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL) and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) cell lines as well as patient samples. The activity
of ONC201 in these hematological malignancies was
determined to be p53-independent, as observed in other
tumor types, and is equally cytotoxic in tumor cells with
complex karyotypes that are associated with a worse
clinical prognosis. Importantly, ONC201 induces high
levels of specific apoptosis in ex vivo MCL patient samples
with clinical resistance to standard-of-care therapies,
such as ibrutinib. ONC201 was similarly active in vivo,
ablating engraftment of human AML cells into NSG mice
to significantly prolong their survival relative to untreated
cohorts [7]. Caspase-dependent apoptosis by ONC201 has
been observed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) via
modulation of Bcl-2 and IAP-family proteins [25].
Single agent ONC201 has pronounced pro-apoptotic
activity in primary Sézary cells from advanced cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients compared with
normal PBMCs from healthy donors [26]. Interestingly,

PRECLINICAL EFFICACY PROFILE
The efficacy of ONC201 has been demonstrated
in numerous cancer cell lines and patient samples that
are refractory to chemotherapy and targeted therapies.
ONC201 has demonstrated single agent anti-tumor
effects in over 15 in vivo preclinical cancer models that
include subcutaneous, orthotopic, and transgenic and
other immunocompetent mouse models in a wide range
of malignancies with infrequent oral administration
(Supplementary Table 1). Based on consistent preclinical
evidence, summarized below in part, ONC201 is currently
being evaluated in multiple advanced cancer types that
exhibit preclinical sensitivity to the drug candidate.

ONC201 was more effective in CTCL patient samples
and cell lines that are relatively more aggressive and
refractory, highlighting its potential clinical utility in
such settings. In addition to inducing the TRAIL pathway,
mechanistic studies revealed that ONC201 inhibited the
phosphorylation of Jak and STAT in CTCL cell lines. The
Jak/STAT signaling pathway is critical in the survival of
CTCL cells [27] and can be inactivated downstream of ISR
activation, suggesting that it is a coordinated downstream
element of the described mechanism of ONC201 rather
than an independent mechanism.

has demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells
isolated from a freshly resected glioblastoma tumor that
was resistant to temozolomide, bevacizumab, and radiation
[1]. In vitro studies of ONC201 in glioblastoma cell lines
suggest that its efficacy is not reduced by mutations in
p53, EGFR, or IDH1/2 genes or MGMT status.
ONC201 was shown to be highly effective in
a subcutaneous xenograft of temozolomide-resistant
glioblastoma as a single agent administered as a single
dose [1]. ONC201 tripled mouse survival when combined
with bevacizumab, the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody
that is FDA-approved for the treatment of glioblastoma
[1]. In addition to highly significant activity against
glioblastoma in vitro and in subcutaneous xenografts,
a single dose of ONC201 was sufficient to double the
survival of mice harboring aggressive intracranial human
glioblastoma tumors [1]. Based on the compelling
efficacy in refractory glioblastoma models and its ability
to traverse the blood brain barrier, the clinical efficacy of
ONC201 is being evaluated as a single agent in a phase II
clinical trial in bevacizumab-naïve recurrent glioblastoma
(NCT02525692). It is worth noting that bortezomib,
which also induces ISR, has shown preclinical activity in
glioblastoma [28] and, despite its minimal penetration of
the blood-brain-barrier [29], demonstrated some signs of
clinical activity in this indication that includes two partial
responses in a phase I glioblastoma trial [30].

ONC201 activity against glioblastoma
The first description of the chemical structure
of ONC201 in the literature is a German patent filed in
1973. While there is no evidence that the compound was
evaluated in any biological assays, the patent speculates
its utility in treating central nervous system disorders.
In agreement with this speculation, murine studies
revealed that ONC201 penetrates the blood-brain-barrier
and is active in brain tumor xenograft models [1]. In
vitro studies have shown that ONC201 inhibits cellular
proliferation, induces TRAIL, and causes cell death in
numerous glioblastoma cancer cell lines in cell culture
models, including those resistant to the standard-of-care
chemotherapy temozolomide. Furthermore, ONC201

is particularly attractive for combinatorial regimens due to a short half-life and PD that persists for days to weeks. Due to this unique PK/
PD relationship, ONC201 could be administered one to two days prior to another anti-cancer agent that would allow for a synergistic PD
overlap (green lines) while avoiding drug-drug interactions.

highly effective at inducing TRAIL and cell death in fresh
CRC specimens. The latter includes complete eradication
of cultured cells from a mucinous adenocarcinoma tumor
resected from an 85 year-old female patient who was
unresponsive to prolonged treatment with the standard-ofcare chemotherapy 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [1].
In vivo, ONC201 induces TRAIL and causes potent
anti-tumor effects when administered as a single dose in
several human CRC subcutaneous xenografts. Extensive
validation of the mechanism of action of ONC201 has
been conducted in CRC xenografts in mice including
correlative assays and genetic studies that demonstrate

The small molecule library screen that led to the
discovery of ONC201 was conducted with a human CRC
cell line, which is a tumor type that possesses relatively
high sensitivity to ONC201 among solid tumors. ONC201
induces TRAIL and subsequent cell death in numerous
human CRC cell lines harboring diverse oncogenic
mutations, including those that result in resistance to
standard-of-care agents in this setting such as p53 and
KRAS. In addition to cancer cell lines, ONC201 was

(via Bag3/Usp9X inhibition) results in synergistic anti-tumor effects via the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis involving Bax/Bak
oligomerization, caspase activation and PARP-cleavage. Improved inhibition of Akt/ERK also contributes to the synergistic effects.

signaling axis in tumors [1, 31].

profile is also favorable. Dose titration studies in a CRC
xenograft model revealed that ONC201 is maximally
efficacious at 25 mg/kg, and is equivalently effective with
oral or intra-peritoneal administration. Several studies
utilized a dose of up to 100 mg/kg without incidence of
ONC201-related mortality or overt signs of toxicity. Body
weight measurements and histology studies in multiple
strains of mice have revealed no evidence of adverse
effects of ONC201 administration on normal mouse
tissues at effective doses [1, 2, 31].
To confirm the safety profile of ONC201 and enable
its translation into the clinic, GLP toxicology studies
were conducted in Sprague Dawley rats and beagle
dogs with oral ONC201 [36]. The only adverse findings
observed in both rats and dogs occurred at the highest
doses tested (225 mg/kg in rats and 120 mg/kg in dogs):
mild and reversible decreased activity, decreased food
consumption, and increased salivation. Interestingly, the
mild adverse effects of ONC201 at exaggerated doses in
animal studies appeared to PK-related (Cmax), unlike its
anti-tumor activity that appears to saturate beyond a given
dose level and frequency. The no-observed-adverse-eventlevel (NOAEL), which is commonly used to determine
starting doses in human clinical trials, was at least 42 mg/
kg in dogs and at least 125 mg/kg in rats. Both of these
NOAELs are approximately 1.25 g in humans assuming
standard allometric conversion and a 60 kg body weight
for humans [36]. These NOAELs correspond to a dose that
is 10-fold above the murine dose of 25 mg/kg that showed
anti-cancer efficacy in human tumor xenograft studies.

ONC201 activity against cancer stem cells
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a rare subpopulation
of stem-like tumor cells that have been shown to drive
tumor initiation, disease progression, resistance to cancer
therapies, disease relapse and metastasis in various tumor
types [32, 33]. The efficacy of ONC201 involves targeting
both bulk tumor cells and CSCs in hematological as
well as solid malignancies. ONC201 has demonstrated
strong preclinical anti-CSC efficacy in CRC, AML and
glioblastoma models [34, 35].
ONC201 significantly depleted CD133, CD44
and Aldefluor-positive 5-FU-resistant CSCs in CRC cell
lines in a manner that was dependent on Akt, Foxo3a,
and DR5. Inhibition of colonosphere formation, as well
as tumor growth and serial passage of CSC-initiated
tumors, has been demonstrated with ONC201 in CRC
[31]. In refractory AML patient samples, ONC201
induced apoptosis in leukemia stem/progenitor cells
(CD45 dim+/ CD34+/ CD38-) to an extent that was
equivalently observed in non-CSCs [7]. ONC201
inhibited cell proliferation of CSC-enriched neurosphere
cultures of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma
patient samples [34] and induced apoptosis in stem-like
glioma cells [35]. The capability of ONC201 to be equally
effective in the CSC subpopulation precludes a common
mechanism of resistance and could augment its longterm therapeutic benefits, especially in advanced stage
previously treated drug-refractory disease.

COMBINATION THERAPY
ONC201 has a half-life of about 6-11 hours across
different species and PD typically engaged several hours
after single-dose administration that persists far beyond
its PK (Figure 4). This disconnect between PK and PD
is particularly attractive for combinatorial regimens,
allowing ONC201 to be administered one to two days
prior to another anti-cancer drug that has demonstrated
synergistic efficacy in preclinical models. This could
allow for a synergistic PD effect without requiring the
therapeutics to be systemically present at the same time
(Figure 5). Thus, ONC201 may be administered with other
therapies using a schedule that significantly diminishes
the potential for drug-drug interactions while maintaining
cooperative intra-tumoral signaling.
Though ONC201 is effective as a single agent
in many cancer models, it is also broadly synergistic
with approved and investigational cancer therapies in
preclinical models in accordance with its mechanism of
action that is distinct and complementary to many other
approved cancer therapies. A screen conducted in solid
tumor cell lines identified several synergistic interactions
between ONC201 and FDA-approved small molecules
used in oncology: azacitidine, bortezomib, dacarbazine,

PRECLINICAL SAFETY PROFILE
ONC201 exhibits an exceptional safety profile given
its broad and potent anti-cancer activity which results in a
wide therapeutic index in vitro and in vivo [36]. ONC201
does not significantly impact the cell cycle profile or
viability of normal human fibroblasts at concentrations
that strongly induce cancer cell death. Lack of ONC201induced cytotoxicity has been demonstrated in normal
fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, and stem-progenitor blood
cells. Furthermore, ONC201 does not induce markers of
genotoxicity in tumor or normal cells [1, 7]. Interestingly,
in vitro co-culture studies suggest that normal cells can
contribute to tumor-specific cytotoxicity via a bystander
effect through TRAIL signaling [1], as observed
with radiation [37-39]. Examining ONC201-induced
downstream signaling in normal cells revealed that DR5
induction is absent, perhaps due to blunted ISR activation,
but that a modest amount of TRAIL is induced on the
surface of normal and stromal fibroblasts [1, 2].
While in vitro studies indicate that ONC201 spares
normal cells from cytotoxic effects, the in vivo safety

sorafenib combined with ONC201 to synergistically
reduce cell viability and cooperatively induce TRAIL,
DR5, and cell death through a mechanism that involved
IAP and Bcl-2 family proteins. The combination produced
an increased rate of complete tumor regression (8/10
tumors) compared to ONC201 (4/10) or sorafenib (0/10)
alone following two weeks of therapy in a hepatocellular
subcutaneous xenograft while being well tolerated [40].

paclitaxel and docetaxel has been documented in nonsmall cell lung cancer cell lines [1]. Single dose ONC201
induced tumor stasis in H460 human non-small cell lung
cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice to an extent that
was comparable to paclitaxel and superior to docetaxel.
The combination of ONC201 with paclitaxel or docetaxel
was well tolerated and resulted in complete regressions of
> 60% of tumor xenografts [1, 31].
The combination of ONC201 and bevacizumab
has also proven cooperative in preclinical glioblastoma
and CRC models. In an orthotopic CRC model, this
combination reduced primary cecal tumor burden and
decreased spread to distal metastatic sites including lung,
liver, lymph nodes and peritoneum. The combination of
ONC201 with bevacizumab caused no significant changes
in body weight. ONC201 was also well tolerated and
cooperative in an orthotopic model of glioblastoma where
the combination tripled the survival of mice receiving
single dose administration [1].
One of the most promising synergistic combinations
with ONC201 is with Bcl-2 inhibitors, which has been
demonstrated in multiple studies. Mcl-1 knockdown

Status

improved the anti-cancer effects of ONC201 in CRC and
leukemia cells [7, 40]. Striking synergy was observed
in vitro with the Bcl-2-specific inhibitor ABT-199 in
leukemia cells [7]. Another study reported robust ONC201
synergy with the Bcl-2-family inhibitor ABT-263 in
glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo [35]. Bcl-2/Bclxl overexpression has been shown to reduce ONC201mediated cell death and high Mcl-1 levels are linked to
ABT-199/ABT-263 resistance. The combined targeting of
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 results in synergistic anti-tumor effects
of ONC201 in combination with ABT-263/ABT-199.
ONC201-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 occurs via downregulation of chaperone Bag3 and the deubiquitinase
Usp9X, both known to stabilize Mcl-1 [7, 35]. Thus,
the combination of ONC201 and Bcl-2 inhibitors uses
complementary mechanisms of sensitization where each
therapy eliminates a key mechanism of resistance for the
other agent (Figure 6).
ONC201 single agent and combinatorial efficacy has
also been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer [41]. Single
agent ONC201 inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in vitro
and in vivo via the Akt/ERK/TRAIL-mediated mechanism.
The combination of ONC201 and gemcitabine was well
tolerated, inhibited xenograft tumor growth and improved
survival in mice [41]. Among hematological malignancies,
synergy has also been documented with the combination
of ONC201 and cytarabine in vitro [24].
Thus, ONC201 combines synergistically and is
well tolerated with a multitude of therapies ranging
from approved chemotherapies and targeted therapies
to investigational agents that can be explored in future
clinical trials. Combining ONC201 with immunotherapies

of immunosuppression and the ability of the novel agent
to stimulate production of TRAIL, which is an effector
cytokine expressed by many activated immune cells.

view of the clinical safety and PK profiles of ONC201
that are expected to permit more frequent dosing without
compromising safety.
Several additional clinical trials are now evaluating
the clinical activity of ONC201 in multiple tumor types
as a single agent (Table 1). The tumor types selected
for phase II clinical trials are based on compelling
preclinical evidence of efficacy. Given the partial
overlap in mechanism with ONC201, it is encouraging
that bortezomib has shown signs of clinical activity in
several of these indications, including glioblastoma [30],
hormone-refractory prostate cancer [43], CTCL [44], nonHodgkin’s lymphoma [45], and multiple myeloma [46].
Several clinical trials are also exploring alternative dosing
regimens with ONC201 in the phase I setting.

PHARMACOKINETICS
The PK profile of ONC201 has been determined
in mice, rats, dogs, and is currently being determined
in humans. ONC201 exposure in beagle dogs following
oral gavage dosing at 4.2, 42, and 120 mg/kg ONC201
was dose-dependent and increased with greater ONC201
dose levels (Supplemental Figure 1A) [36]. Exposure to
ONC201 was slightly higher in the female dogs relative to
the male dogs. The terminal half-life ranged from 4.6 to
7.8 hours in this species.
In rats, exposure to ONC201 was dose-dependent
and approximately dose-proportional (Supplemental
Figure 1B) [36]. Exposure to ONC201 was slightly greater
in female rats after a single oral gavage dose. The terminal
half-life ranged from 2.3 to 8.4 hours. The volume of
distribution was large, ranging from ~49 to ~103 L/kg in 6
of 8 evaluated profiles, suggesting that ONC201 is widely
distributed. The half-life of ONC201 in mice is ~6 hours
with intravenous administration as measured by an HPLCUV assay [1].
The pharmacokinetics of single agent ONC201 in
a phase I clinical trial in advanced solid tumors is being
evaluated by LC-MS-MS analysis of plasma collected
in the first cycle of therapy within 21 days of the first
administration of ONC201 [42].

CHEMICAL PROFILE AND EXTENDING
THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF
ONC201
The pharmacophore of ONC201 is an imidazo [1,2a]pyrido [4,3-d]pyrimidine heterocycle [47] that offers
a unique core structure. The small molecule has several
chemical properties that are favorable as a drug candidate:
no stereoisomers, highly stable, facile synthesis, adequate
aqueous solubility, passively penetrates the blood-brain
barrier. A proprietary salt formulation has been created for
preclinical and clinical studies of ONC201 that improves
the stability and solubility of the compound.
Given the novel pharmacophore of ONC201, its
unique mechanism, and its profile that has translated well
to the clinic, a medicinal chemistry effort was undertaken
to alter drug characteristics such as potency, metabolism,
and biodistribution. Structure-function studies identified
an inactive linear isomer of ONC201 that does not affect
Akt/ERK/Foxo3 signaling, and is unable to induce
TRAIL and cell death in tumor cells. This inactive isomer
serves as an ideal negative control for preclinical studies
[47]. One example where ONC201 analogs may be
particularly attractive for development are tumor types
where the potency required to achieve efficacy cannot
be physiologically achieved by ONC201. A few lead
candidates have emerged that exhibit a 10- to 200-fold
potency improvements in human cancer cells in a range
of tumor types. Thus, ONC201 is the founding member
of a novel class of therapies, which are collectively called
imipridones based on their core chemical structure, that
can extend its attractive therapeutic profile to an array of
distinct chemical entities and clinical utilities.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION
The clinical safety of ONC201 has been evaluated
in a phase I trial [42]. The design was an open-label,
dose-escalation phase I trial of mono-agent ONC201
in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors who
had exhausted or refused standard treatment options
for their respective indications. The primary objective
of this study was to determine the recommended phase
II dose (RP2D) of ONC201 administered orally in
patients with advanced cancers. Secondary objectives
were also assessed including PK and PD. An accelerated
dose escalation design, which uses single patient dose
cohorts in the absence of significant adverse events, was
employed due to the excellent safety profile of ONC201.
In accordance with the benign preclinical safety profile
of ONC201, the study advanced through five dose levels
ranging from 125 mg through 625 mg, with one patient
per dose level. Six patients were enrolled at the highest
dose level of 625 mg. The study identified a recommended
Phase II dose of 625mg with robust safety and PK profiles,
ONC201 plasma concentrations in the therapeutic
range, preliminary evidence of tumor engagement and
prolonged PD. Weekly dosing is under investigation in

CONCLUSIONS
ONC201 is a first-in-class, orally active, non-toxic
anti-tumor agent currently being evaluated in advance
cancer clinical trials. The anti-tumor effects of ONC201
74389

Oncotarget

are mediated by an early-stage ISR activation in tumor
cells via a potentially novel target(s) for oncology that
leads to pronounced anti-cancer efficacy at doses without
observable toxicity towards normal cells. ONC201mediated ISR activation involves phosphorylation of
eIF2α, which leads to induction of ATF-4 and CHOP.
ISR activation leads to ONC201-mediated dual inhibition
of Akt/ERK and activation of Foxo3a, which ultimately
results in induction of DR5 and TRAIL causing cancer cell
death. The robust anti-tumor efficacy of ONC201 has been
demonstrated in numerous solid tumors and hematological
malignancies in preclinical models as a single agent and
in combination regimens. The benign safety profile of
ONC201 has been established in a range of animals and
is being confirmed in phase I clinical trials. The unique
pharmacophore of ONC201 has been extended to create
the imipridone class of compounds that possess distinct
properties, such as improved potency in tumor types that
are less sensitive to ONC201. The atypical discovery
and development approach with ONC201 exemplifies
how phenotypic drug discovery and parallel, rather
than sequential research and development efforts enable
synergistic multi-disciplinary information in real-time that
can aggregately unveil revelations that might not have
been apparent with traditional approaches.
