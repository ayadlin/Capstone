Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer is a disease potentiated by mutations in somatic cells. Cancer mutations are not distributed
uniformly along the genome. Instead, different genomic regions vary by up to 5-fold in the local
density of somatic mutations1, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods of cancer
genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer
mutational landscape1-5. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly
cell-type-specific6,7. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple samples of diverse
cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here, we show that
chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86% of
the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. Overwhelmingly, the best predictors of local
somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin
of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are
much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of cognate cancer
cell lines. We show further that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined
based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, DNA sequence of a cancer genome

encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of
origin.

Recent studies have begun to address the underlying causes of cancer mutational
heterogeneity by comparing mutation rate variation to the distribution of sequence features,
gene expression and epigenetic marks along the genome 2-5. A major limitation of previous
studies was their uniform treatment of mutations from different cancers, and their
consideration of epigenetic marks from a single cell type, usually a cell type different from
the cancer tissue of origin. However, cancer is far from being a disease of uniform origin,
progression and cell biology. Instead, different cancer types differ in their overall mutation
rates, their predominant mutation types, and the distribution of mutations along their
genomes1. Substantial variation also exists in the epigenomic landscape of different tissues,
specifically in patterns of chromatin accessibility, histone modifications8 [EC00], gene
expression and DNA replication timing9. The full understanding of the factors contributing
to mutational heterogeneity in cancer genomes thus requires the evaluation of the
relationship between multiple epigenetic marks and mutation patterns in a cell-type-specific
manner.
We analyzed a total of 173 cancer genomes from eight different cancer types that represent a
wide range of tissues of origin, carcinogenic mechanisms, and mutational signatures:
melanoma10, multiple myeloma11, lung adenocarcinoma12, liver cancer13, colorectal
cancer14, glioblastoma15, esophageal adenocarcinoma16, and lung squamous cell
carcinoma17. Regional variations in mutation density appeared similar although not identical
among the different cancer types (Extended Data Fig. 1).

We compared the genomic distribution of mutations in these cancer genomes to 424
epigenetic features that were measured by the Epigenome Roadmap consortium [EC00].
These features were derived from 106 different cell types from 45 different tissue types,
including the cell types of origin of most of the cancer types that we investigated (Methods
and Extended Data Fig. 2). Importantly, the data represent primary human cells rather than
cell lines. These epigenetic features comprised eight different types of variables, including
DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS) (a global measure of chromatin accessibility)7 and
various histone modifications. An example of the variation in mutation density along
chromosomes at 1Mb scale together with a representative epigenetic mark (DHS) is shown
in Figure 1. In this case, as in most other cases (see below), epigenetic marks indicative of
open chromatin and high gene activity were associated with low mutation density, while
repressive, closed chromatin marks were associated with regions of high mutation density.
Notably, these statistical associations do not necessarily imply causal effects of individual
chromatin features, nor point to specific biological mechanisms.
The comparison of individual epigenomic features with local mutation density revealed that
chromatin marks corresponding to the tumor's cell type of origin are more strongly
associated with local mutation density than marks corresponding to unrelated cell types. For
example, DHS marks from melanocytes explained a substantially larger fraction of the
variance in melanoma mutation density than DHS marks from other cell types, even from
the same tissue (skin) (Figure 1b). As another example, even though H3K4me1 marks in

melanocytes and hepatocytes are highly correlated (r=0.8), the distribution of mutations in
liver cancer followed the levels of H3K4me1 in hepatocytes, but not in melanocytes, while
melanoma mutations correlated with the levels of H3K4me1 in melanocytes but not in
hepatocytes (Figure 1c).
This initial observation suggested that the impact of chromatin on local mutation density is
highly cell-type-specific. The comprehensive representation of different cell types in the
Epigenome Roadmap could thus enable an improved prediction accuracy of mutations
compared to previous studies. To rigorously quantify the contribution of different chromatin
marks and gene expression to regional mutation density, and the extent of cell type
specificity, we used Random Forest regression (Methods).

Author Manuscript

Remarkably epigenetic marks, together with replication timing measured in ENCODE cell
lines 18, collectively explained 74-86% of the variance in mutation density in seven cancer
types (Figure 2a). In glioblastoma, for which fewer mutations were available for the
analysis, 55% of the variance in mutation density could be explained. This is substantially
higher than in earlier studies4 and indicates that, at least for these cancer types, we have
identified a set of epigenetic variables and cell types that almost fully predict the mutational
variability along the genome. This enhanced prediction accuracy was not simply due to the
larger size of the training data relative to previous studies, as the predictive ability dropped
by only~2-6% when only 10% of the data was used (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Author Manuscript

Prediction accuracy in individual samples is expected to be lower than in samples pooled by
cancer type due to tumor heterogeneity, sampling variance, and a lower number of mutations
available for the analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4). To evaluate the influences of these
variables on the prediction ability of the Random Forest model, we simulated mutation
datasets of variable sizes generated by the model itself, and compared the prediction
accuracy of simulated and real data as a function of the number of mutations. For most
samples, epigenomic features explained most (on average 70%) of the maximally predicted
variance (Extended Data Fig. 5), and more than was explained by earlier studies2,4 when
matching dataset sizes. As a point of direct comparison with an earlier study2 that did not
use cell type specific chromatin marks, our model explained 50% of the variance in mutation
density in the melanoma cell line COLO82919, for which the earlier study explained 29% of
the variance.

Author Manuscript

The prediction accuracy was similar whether testing for all mutations or only the mutations
of the predominant type (Extended Data Fig. 6) in each cancer type 1,20 (Figure 2b). A
notable exception was lung adenocarcinoma, where a larger fraction of the variance could be
explained for G>T mutations associated with smoking 1,12,21 than for C>T mutations. This
difference was observed for both samples with G>T transversions12 and C>T transitions as
the leading mutational sources (Figure 2c).
Interestingly, prediction accuracy was fully explained by chromatin features, with gene
expression and nucleotide content not providing any further improvement to the accuracy of
the model. Even though gene expression has been unequivocally demonstrated to influence

mutation density, chromatin features appear to be statistically stronger predictors (Extended
Data Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

When considering individual contributions to mutation rate prediction, between six and
nineteen variables passed the significance threshold in any individual cancer type. There was
a sweeping association between cancer mutations and chromatin marks measured in the cell
type of origin of each cancer (Figures 3a). For instance, six out of the top ten features
explaining variation in melanoma mutation density were derived from melanocytes (Figure
1 and Figure 3b). Similarly, seven out of the nine top features explaining mutational profiles
in liver cancer were measured in liver cells. Comparable results were obtained for multiple
myeloma, colorectal adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma, where most of the significant
features were measured in hematopoietic, intestine mucosa and brain tissues, respectively.
For esophageal adenocarcinoma, the top predictors where chromatin features derived from
stomach mucosa rather than from esophageal tissues; this is expected given that the analyzed
esophageal adenocarcinomas were triggered by Barrett's esophagus cells that resemble
stomach epithelial cells 22. Lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma were
the only exceptions in that the top predictors were scattered among different tissue groups;
the lack of tissue specificity in these cases likely results from the absence of epigenetic
marks from normal lung epithelial cells in our dataset.

Author Manuscript

The results of the Random Forest regression were confirmed using backward feature
selection to identify the minimal set of epigenetic predictors of mutations in each cancer
type (Methods). As few as three to five features were sufficient to capture the variance
explained by the full set of 424 different features (Extended Data Fig. 8), and in all cancers
besides lung (as above), most of these features were derived from the corresponding cell
types of origin. As a more direct test, we grouped all epigenomic data by cell or tissue type
and compared the collective explanatory power of chromatin features derived from the cell
types of origin vs. unmatched cell types. The results of this analysis confirmed the cell type
specificity of the association between chromatin features and mutation density (Figure 3c).

Author Manuscript

The above results pose a key question on whether epigenomic features derived from the cell
type of origin are the strongest determinants of cancer mutations, or whether they simply
serve as the best available proxies to the chromatin organization of the corresponding
malignant cells. The availability of epigenomic data for the liver cancer cell line HepG28
and for melanoma cell lines made it possible to directly address this question. Surprisingly,
in both cases, epigenomic features from the cell type of origin resulted in a higher prediction
accuracy than those from the cancer cell lines. The Random Forest predictor trained on
chromatin features of HepG2 was less accurate in predicting the liver cancer mutation
density than the analogous predictor trained on features of hepatocytes (Figure 3d).
Similarly, chromatin accessibility in melanocytes was a much better predictor of mutation
density in the COLO829 melanoma cell line (Figure 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9). Thus,
chromatin features associated with carcinogenesis do not determine cancer mutations to the
same extent as chromatin features of the cells of origin. We envision two potential
explanations for this observation. First, most of the mutations observed in cancers may arise
prior to the epigenetic changes linked to neoplastic progression. In addition, advanced

tumors may undergo specific epigenetic changes that distinguish them from other tumors of
the same type.

Author Manuscript

Taken together, the above results strongly suggest that the cell of origin of an individual
tumor sample could be predicted from its mutation pattern alone. Mutation profiles of
individual samples cluster according to cancer type, and, consequently cell of origin (Figure
4a). We developed a straightforward predictor based on enrichment of epigenomic variables
from a single cell type among the top 20 variables selected by the Random Forest analysis.
This approach classified 88% of melanoma, colorectal, liver, multiple myeloma, esophageal
and glioblastoma cancer genomes to melanocytes, colonic mucosa, liver, hematopoietic,
stomach mucosa and brain tissues, respectively (Figure 4b). Thus, mutational patterns
contain sufficient information for identifying the cell type of origin of a tumor. We propose
that sequencing the DNA of a tumor of unknown primary origin can allow the precise
pinpointing of the cell type of origin of that tumor.
Traditionally, statistical prediction in cancer has made use of gene expression data We
therefore constructed an analogous predictor of cell of origin using RNA sequencing data
from 167 glioblastoma multiforme and 370 skin cutaneous melanoma samples 23. This
predictor achieved accuracies of 78% and 57% on these cancer types, slightly lower than the
mutation-based predictor. Although these two classifiers are not directly comparable, it is
clear that genome sequence carries at least the same amount of information about the cell of
origin as gene expression data does.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our observations suggest that cancer mutation density is linked to the
epigenomic profile in a highly cell-type-specific manner. Thus, DNA sequence is
informative about the origin of an individual tumor. The accumulating epigenomic data on
human cell types opens the perspective for accurate prediction of the cell of origin of a
cancer from its genome sequence.

Methods
Data
We divided the human genome into 1 MB regions, excluding regions overlapping
centromeres and telomeres, as well as regions where the fraction of uniquely mappable base
pairs was lower than 0.92. We calculated the mean signal for different histone
modifications, DNAse I hypersensitivity and replication timing in different cell types, and
used these 424 features to predict mutation density along the genome in eight different
cancer types (see below).

Author Manuscript

We calculated mutation density by obtaining data for 173 individual cancer genomes,
belonging to eight cancer types: melanoma (25 genomes)10, lung adenocarcinoma (24
genomes)12, lung squamous cell carcinoma (12 genomes)17, esophageal adenocarcinoma (9
genomes)16, liver (64 genomes)13, multiple myeloma (23 genomes)11, colorectal cancer14
(CRC, 9 genomes) and glioblastoma (7 genomes)15. The whole genome of the COLO-829
cell line has been sequenced by the Sanger Institute. The COLO-829 cell line was derived
from metastatic tissue. The liver cancers were sequenced by the National Cancer Center

For each cancer type we counted the overall number of mutations in all individual cancer
genomes belonging to that cancer type. We also determined the mutation densities for all
possible types of mutations in each cancer types by counting different types of mutations in
1 Mb windows and normalizing for the sequence composition of each window.

We downloaded data for 7 different histone modifications and DNAse I hypersensitivity
from Epigenomics Roadmap [EC00] and ENCODE8 (Extended data Fig. 1). Epigenomic

Facility under the direction of Shelly Heimfeld at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research

For histone modifications we combined reads for all samples belonging to one cell type and
calculated RPKM values for 1 Mb windows along the genome. We also calculated the
average number of DNAse I hypersensitivity peaks overlapping 1 Mb windows across all
samples belonging to a certain cell type. We used BEDOPS25 to map reads and DHS peaks
to intervals.
We obtained data for four different Repli-seq experiments from the ENCODE project
(Extended Data Fig. 1) and determined replication timing as the average value of waveletsmoothed signal in each 1 Mb window. Lymphoblastoid cell line replication time was
obtained from Koren et al., 201226 and averaged over 1Mb windows along the genome.

To control for the effect of sequence features on mutation density, for each 1 Mb window
we also calculated GC content, the number of CpG, GpC, and ApT dinucleotides, and
fraction of the window overlapping coding regions, known genes and CpG islands.
To control for the effect of expression on mutation density we downloaded mRNA-seq data
from the Epigenomics Roadmap [EC00], for 38 different cell types for which expression
data was available (Extended Data Table 1). We combined reads for all samples belonging
to one cell type and calculated RPKM values for the set of all protein coding exons in 1 Mb
windows, the set of all protein coding and lncRNA exons in 1 Mb windows, the maximally
expressed gene in a 1 Mb window or non-genic regions in 1 Mb windows.

Random Forest regression

Author Manuscript

Random Forest is a non-parametric machine learning method that combines the output of an
ensemble of regression trees to predict the value of a continuous response variable27. The
use of multiple regression trees reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the method robust
to outliers and noise in the input data. For each regression tree, a training set of N samples
are drawn, with replacement, from the dataset. The remaining data (out-of-bag data)
constitutes the test set for this tree, and is used to compute the mean squared prediction error
of the tree. The prediction for each sample is made by taking the average of predictions over
all trees for which the sample was part of the out-of-bag data.

Author Manuscript

Random Forest provides an internal measure of the importance of different predictor
variables, based on out-of-bag data. The mean squared error calculated on the out-of-bag
data is recorded in every tree grown in the forest. The values of all the predictor variables
are then randomly permuted in all the out-of-bag samples and the mean squared error is
computed again. The difference between the two errors is averaged over all the trees, and
normalized by the standard error, representing the raw importance score for each variable.
We used Random Forest with 1000 trees to predict mutation densities in 1Mb nonoverlapping windows in the eight different cancer types using 424 predictor variables
(epigenetic features and replication timing; Extended Data Fig. 1). We divided the data into
ten non-overlapping sets and predicted the number of mutations in each cancer type using
10-fold cross-validation. For each sample, the predicted value corresponded to the predicted
mutation density when this sample was part of the test set. We used Pearson productmoment correlation to interpret the prediction accuracy. The fraction of variance explained
by each model was calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient squared.

Author Manuscript

Controlling for the effect of sequence features and expression on prediction accuracy
We created different subsets of features corresponding to chromatin (histone modifications
and DNase hypersensitivity, 419 features), replication timing (5 features), sequence (7
features) and expression (38 features). We then used Random Forest regression with 10-fold
cross-validation to predict mutation density in different cancers, where for each cancer type
we trained different models: on each subset of features separately and on combinations of
different subsets of features.
Variable importance analysis

Author Manuscript

Variable importance was calculated for each predictor variable in each cancer type by
permuting the variable, i.e. randomly shuffling the data values so that the relationship
between the response and predictor variables was destroyed. The percent of increase in
mean squared error of prediction was then calculated. Since the variable importance can be
influenced by both the correlation and the scale of the variables, we calculated the empirical
p-value of variable importance measures by repeatedly permuting the response variable in
Random Forest models, in order to determine the distribution of measured importance
values for each predictor variable28. This procedure was repeated 1000 times, and the
number of times in which the importance measure in the original data set was lower or equal

to the permuted importance measure was counted; this count represented the p-value, with a
count of one corresponding to a significance level of P<0.001.
Feature selection

Author Manuscript

We applied backward elimination to identify a minimal set of predictors for each cancer
type. Backward elimination is a “greedy” algorithm which finds the locally optimal subset
of features, but does not guarantee finding the global optimum. However, it is less
computationally intensive than searching all possible feature subsets when the number of
features (N) is large (in our case N=424). Initially, we trained a Random Forest with 10-fold
cross-validation on the complete set of variables and determined the importance of all the
variables in the model (the importance was calculated as the mean importance of the
variable across 10 rounds of cross-validation). We then ranked the variables according to
their importance and determined the top 20 variables. We then sequentially trained 20
models, removing the least important variable at each step, until only one predictor variable
was left for training.
Principal coordinate analysis
We used principal coordinate analysis to visualize the dissimilarities in mutation density
distributions between individual cancer genomes. Dissimilarity was calculated as 1 –
Pearson correlation coefficient, for all possible combinations of individual cancer genomes.
Prediction of tissue of origin for individual cancer genomes

Author Manuscript

For each individual cancer genome we predicted the density of mutations using Random
Forest regression with 10-fold cross-validation. We used the full set of features and
determined the top 20 features according to the variable importance measure. We then
calculated the enrichment of each tissue type among the top 20 features using the
hypergeometric test and chose the tissue showing the most significant enrichment as the
most likely tissue of origin for the individual cancer genome. We then calculated the
percentage of individual cancers where the assigned tissue of origin matched the predicted
tissue of origin.
Prediction of cell of origin using gene expression

Author Manuscript

For each individual cancer we downloaded gene expression data from The Cancer Genome
Atlas15 and calculated the expression of the same genes in the 38 cell types for which
mRNA-seq data was available from the Epigenomics Roadmap (Extended Data Table 1).
For each cancer we trained a Random Forest regression model in which the gene expression
values in cancer were used as the response variable and the gene expression in normal cells
as the predictors. We identified the predictor variable, which showed the highest value of
variable importance in the model and assigned the corresponding cell type as cell of origin
of the cancer.

Mutation density in melanoma is associated with individual chromatin features specific to
melanocytes. (a) The density of C>T mutations in melanoma alongside a 100kb window
profile of melanocyte chromatin accessibility (“DNase I accessibility index”; shown in
normalized, reverse scale; high values correspond to less accessible chromatin and vice
versa). (b) The number of mutations per megabase in melanoma versus DHS density, for
three types of skin cells. (c) The normalized density of mutations in liver cancer and
melanoma genomes as a function of density quintiles of H3K4me1 marks in liver cells and
in melanocytes. For both cancer genomes, mutation density depends only on H3K4me1
marks measured in the cell of origin.

Predicting local mutation density in cancer genomes using Random Forest regression trained
on 424 epigenomic profiles. Pearson correlation between observed and predicted mutation
densities along chromosomes is shown. (a) Actual versus predicted mutation densities in
eight cancers. (b, c) Prediction accuracy represented as mean ± s.e.m (estimated using 10fold cross-validation). Panels show prediction accuracy for all mutations and for nucleotide
changes predominant in the corresponding cancer (b), and prediction accuracy in lung
adenocarcinoma genomes stratified by smoking history and predominant nucleotide changes
(G>T or C>T) (c).
