Abstract
Tumor angiogenesis is a degenerate process regulated by a complex network of proangiogenic factors.
Existing antiangiogenic drugs used in clinic are characterized by selectivity for specific factors. Antiangiogenic
properties might be improved in drugs that target multiple factors and thereby address the inherent mechanistic
degeneracy in angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
family members and their cognate receptors are key players in promoting tumor angiogenesis. Here we report
the pharmacologic profile of E-3810, a novel dual inhibitor of the VEGF and FGF receptors. E-3810 potently and
selectively inhibited VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3 and FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 and -2 kinases in the
nanomolar range. Ligand-dependent phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 was suppressed along with
human vascular endothelial cell growth at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, E-3810 lacked cytotoxic
effects on cancer cell lines under millimolar concentrations. In a variety of tumor xenograft models, including
early- or late-stage subcutaneous and orthotopic models, E-3810 exhibited striking antitumor properties at welltolerated oral doses administered daily. We found that E-3810 remained active in tumors rendered nonresponsive to the general kinase inhibitor sunitinib resulting from a previous cycle of sunitinib treatment. In
Matrigel plug assays performed in nude mice, E-3810 inhibited basic FGF–induced angiogenesis and reduced
blood vessel density as assessed by histologic analysis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
analysis confirmed that E-3810 reduced the distribution of angiogenesis-sensitive contrast agents after only
5 days of treatment. Taken together, our findings identify E-3810 as a potent antiangiogenic small molecule with
a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and broad spectrum antitumor activity, providing a strong rationale for its
clinical evaluation. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1396–405. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer cell growth is dependent on neo-vascularization to
deliver oxygen and nutrients (1, 2). The formation of new
vessels relies on a complex series of orchestrated events with
the activation of endothelial and perivascular cells (pericytes
and smooth cells), and the modification of the surrounding
basement membrane and extracellular matrix. Tumor angiogenesis is initiated by proangiogenic factors, produced by both
host and tumor cells, including vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibro-

blast growth factor (FGF), angiopoietin, and others. VEGF,
PDGF, and FGF act by binding to their cognate tyrosine kinase
receptors on endothelial and stromal cells, setting in motion a
cascade of intracellular signaling transduction pathways that
leads to increased vascular permeability, endothelial and
stromal cell survival and proliferation, invasion, and migration. This makes angiogenesis not only one of the hallmarks of
cancers but also an important target for cancer therapy (3, 4).
Targeted agents are available that interfere with the formation and maintenance of blood vessels and can increase survival
in cancer patients (5–7). These include bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A, as well as sunitinib, sorafenib, and
pazopanib, small molecules with multitargeted tyrosine kinase
inhibitory activity, encompassing activity against VEGF and
PDGF receptors (VEGFR and PDGFR; refs 8–11). However,
the clinical benefit induced by agents targeting the VEGF pathway is less than initially expected (12, 13). Several escape
mechanisms have been shown in different preclinical models
and may contribute to the disappointing clinical outcomes (14,
15). In particular, continuous VEGF blocking seems to activate
alternative pathways (e.g., FGF/FGFR and PFGF/PDGFR) that
drive angiogenesis and tumor progression (16–18).
Although the role of the FGF/FGFR pathway in tumor
angiogenesis is established, the pathway is probably also

implicated in the development and maintenance of some solid
and hematologic malignances (19–21). High FGF and FGFR
expression levels have been reported in breast and prostate
human cancers (22, 23). Experimental evidence suggests that
FGFRs act as oncogenes in certain tumors and can act
autonomously to maintain cancer cell growth (24, 25).
The possibility of hitting the FGF/FGFR pathways with the
same molecule in tumor vasculature and in tumor cells might
result in significant better therapeutic outcomes. A number of
molecules that interfere with the FGF signal have been
synthesized and are under investigation, including selective
agents and molecules with a more complex kinase inhibition
profile with activity against FGFR and other tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, variably combined (24, 26).
We report here the pharmacologic characterization of E3810, a novel dual inhibitor of VEGFR and FGFR. The compound is a very potent inhibitor of VEGFR and FGFR tyrosine
kinases, is suitable for chronic oral administration, blocks
FGF- and VEGF-driven angiogenesis, and shows broad antitumor activity in vivo, being active in all the human tumor
xenografts tested. Tumors not responsive to sunitinb do
respond to E-3810.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures
Human umbelical vein cells (HUVEC) were isolated as
described (27) and maintained as monolayer in MCDB131
medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% (v/v) L-glutammine, 5 units/mL heparin, and 50
mg/mL endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) using culture
flasks or plates precoated with 1% (v/v) gelatin. NIH3T3
(murine fibroblasts), A2780 (human ovarian carcinoma),
A498 and SN12KI (human renal cancers), HepG2 (human
hepatocarcinoma), and HT-29 (human colon carcinoma) cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection;
RXF393 (human renal carcinoma) was obtained from Prof. H.
Fiebig (Freiburg, Germany).
Drugs
E-3810, sunitinib, and brivanib were synthesized by ChemPartner Co. Ltd. All drugs were dissolved in 100% DMSO at a
final concentration of 10 mM for in vitro treatment. For in vivo
experiments drugs were dissolved in Methocel 0.5%; drug
solutions were made every 5 days and kept at þ4 C, as these
working solutions are stable for at least 7 days, with the
exception of brivanib, which was dissolved immediately
before use. All treatments were administered by gavage daily
at the doses and schedules described in the Results section of
this article. B-B PDGF, VEGF165, and basic FGF (bFGF) ligands
were purchased from Peprotech (INALCO Spa).
Antiproliferative assays
Exponentially growing HUVEC or NHI3T3 cells were seeded
into 96-well plates at a density of 3 to 6  103 cells/100 mL/
well in complete medium. In the experiments without serum
starvation, 24 hours after seeding, cells were exposed to
different E-3810 concentrations without or with VEGF165

www.aacrjournals.org

(50 ng/mL) or bFGF (20 ng/mL) ligands and the antiproliferative effect of the drugs was evaluated after 72 hours by
MTS Colorimetric Assay (Promega). In the assays with serum
starvation conditions, 24 hours after seeding complete medium was removed and after 3 rounds of washing with PBS, cells
were cultured in medium containing 1% BSA. After 18 to 24
hours, cells were processed as described earlier. Exponentially
growing A2780, A498, SN12KI, and HepG2 cells were seeded
into 96-well plates at 3 to 5  103 cells/100 mL/well in
complete medium. Twenty-four hours later cells were treated
with different drug concentrations for 72 hours and the
antiproliferative effect was evaluated by MTS.
Xenograft models
Six- to eight-week-old female NCr-nu/nu mice were
obtained from Harlan S.p.A., Italy. They were maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions, housed in isolated
ventilated cages, and handled using aseptic procedures. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in
conformity with institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies. The
procedures for subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation of
the different tumors are specified in Supplementary Material
and Methods. Tumor growth was measured twice weekly with
a Vernier caliper, and tumor weights (mg ¼ mm3) were
calculated as follows: (length [mm]  width [mm]2)/2. Efficacy
of the treatment was expressed as best tumor growth inhibition [%T/C ¼ (median tumor weight of treated tumors/
median tumor weight of control tumors)  100] or tumor
growth delay (T  C ¼ median time to reach 500 or 1000 mg in
treated tumor  median time to reach 500 or 1000 mg in
control tumor).
Immunohistochemistry
At the beginning (T ¼ 0) and end of treatment (T ¼ 2)
representative mice from control and treated group were
killed and tumors were excised and embedded in optimal
cutting compound snap-frozen, and stored at 80 C. Cryosections (4 mm) were fixed in methanol/acetone at room
temperature. Vessels were counted by immunostaining with
anti-CD31 antibody MEC13.3 (Beckton Dickinson GmbH),
followed by a biotin-conjugated mouse antirat IgG1/2a monoclonal antibody (clone G28-5, Beckton Dickinson GmbH), and
a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate (Biozol
Diagnostika GmbH). Chromogenic detection was done with
the chromogen solution of the Dako REAL Detection System
AP/RED (Dako Deutschland GmbH). Three randomly selected
measurement fields (0.57 mm2) from each tumor with representative vessel density were scanned and the examiner
marked all CD31-stained vascular structures. The vessel number was determined using computer-aided image analysis
software (Axio Vision Release 4.6). For collagen type IV
immunohistochemistry, cryosections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. Then the antimurine collagen
type IV antibody AB756 (Millipore/Chemicon, Schwalbach/
Ts.) was applied followed by biotin-SP-conjugated AffiniPure
Goat anti Rabbit IgG(HþL) (Dianova GmbH). To assess the
extent of collagen type IV staining, 3 randomly selected areas

(0.57 mm2) of each tumor were captured photographically.
The red stained area (representing collagen IV deposition) was
assessed by computer-aided image analysis and as a percentage of the whole measurement area (Axio Vision Release 4.6).
The necrotic tumor area was evaluated after H&E staining.
Whole tumor sections were scanned at low power (4 objective ¼ 3.58 mm2 area). The examiner marked the total tumor
area and the necrotic tumor area on the scanned microscopic
images and the areas were calculated by computer-aided
image analysis, giving the tumor necrosis area as a percentage
of the total tumor area.
In vivo magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed on
A498-bearing mice treated (3 mice) with E-3810 or not (2
mice) using a BioSpec AVIII system (Bruker BioSpin) dedicated to small rodents, equipped with a 7 Tesla/30-cm magnet
and a 35-mm birdcage RF coil. All mice were imaged just
before (T0) and 5 days (T1) and 12 days (T2) after daily vehicle
and E-3810 treatment. Throughout the duration of the scans,
animals were kept under controlled anesthesia (about 30% O2,
70% N2, and 0.8–1% isofluorane). Tumor vascularization
was investigated by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)
series comprising 74 transversal FLASH (Fast Low Angle SHot)
2-dimensional (2D) T1 weighted scans acquired after
injection of the contrast agent (CA) B22956/1 (Bracco Imaging
SpA; ref. 28), 0.1 mmol/kg, with the following parameters: TR/
TE 100/3.5 ms, flip angle (FA) 90 , matrix size 128  256, fieldof-view 2.5  2.5 cm2 (corresponding to ca. 200  100 mm2 inplane resolution), 6 slices 2 mm thick, acquisition time 59
seconds/image. One scan with the same parameters was run
before CA injection. Precontrast T1 values in tumors were
measured using a multislice variable flip-angle FLASH (29).
Image 2D reconstruction for all MRI experiments was done
using the proprietary scanner software ParaVision. Image
postprocessing and analysis were carried out by in-house
developed routines running under ImageJ (Rasband W.S.,
NIH, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/faqs.html).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses for the evaluation of the antitumor
activity were done using Prism software (Prism 5.01; GraphPad Software). Statistical differences were evaluated by 2-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. P < 0.05 was
considered significant. Statistical analysis for the evaluation of
the MRI experiments was done with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Rel.
17.0.0. 2008).

Figure 2. Tumor growth inhibition after treatment with E-3810. The antitumor activity of E-3810 was tested in HT-29 colon cancer (A), in A2780 tumor
xenograft (B), in RXF393 (C), in A498 (D), and in SKN12I (E) renal xenografts. All tumors were transplanted subcutaneously and when the masses reached
100 to 150 mg, mice were randomized to receive daily for 30 consecutive days vehicle (¤), E-3810 10 mg/kg (~), 15 mg/kg (þ), 20 mg/kg (&), 30 mg/kg (D), 40
mg/kg (), and sunitinib 40 mg/kg (^). Panel D reports the relative tumor weight (RTW).

phosphorylation, a downstream marker of both VEGF and
FGF signaling, was also inhibited. In NIH3T3 cells, PDGFR
auto-phosphorylation was inhibited only at E-3810 concentrations in the mM range (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Consistent with the inhibitory activity of VEGFR and FGFR
auto-phosphorylation, E-3810 potently inhibited VEGF and
bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation with IC50 of 40 and
50 nM, respectively. We then tested E-3810 activity in vitro
on different human cancer cell lines and, as opposed to
HUVEC system, mM concentrations were needed to inhibit
cell growth in nonligand-dependent conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
In vivo studies
Antiangiogenetic effect of E-3810. The effect of E-3810
on angiogenesis was studied in an in vivo model of vessel
formation induced by bFGF in a Matrigel plug injected subcutaneously in mice. bFGF embedded in the plug induced a
strong angiogenic response, with a 2- to 3-fold increase (P < 0.01)
in hemoglobin content compared with plugs containing
Matrigel alone (Supplementary Fig. S2). E-3810, at oral dosing

of 20 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days, completely inhibited (P <
0.01) the bFGF induced angiogenic response compared with the
response in vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2).
E-3810 efficacy in human tumor xenograft models. The
in vivo efficacy of E-3810 was studied on a broad panel of
human tumor xenografts and in different experimental conditions (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 2). The activity of sunitinib and
brivanib at their reported optimal doses (26, 30–32) is also
presented (Figs. 2 and 3). E-3810 showed a broad spectrum of
activity, being active in all the xenografts tested (HT29 colon
carcinoma, A2780 ovarian carcinoma, A498, SN12K1, and
RXF393 renal carcinomas) with dose-dependent inhibition
of tumor growth (Fig. 2, Table 2, and data not shown). The
optimal dose-schedule was defined as 20 mg/kg given daily by
mouth (p.o.) for 30 days; this schedule caused less than 10%
weight loss (Supplementary Fig. S3). E-3810 significantly
delayed growth during treatment, but tumors resumed their
growth when treatment was suspended (Fig. 2); in a few cases,
tumor regression was observed (Fig. 2C). These effects were
similar to those observed with sunitinib tested at its optimal
dose (40 mg/kg daily; Fig. 2).

The A498 renal cancer xenograft model was used to study
the antitumor activity of E-3810 in specific settings (Fig. 3).
E-3810 was very effective in advanced disease, when treatment
started at a tumor size of approximately 400 to 500 mg
(Fig. 3A). Similarly to the early stage setting, stabilization
was observed for the whole duration of treatment but tumors
resumed their growth on drug withdrawal. In this late-stage
setting, the comparison with brivanib, a dual VEGFR and
FGFR inhibitor, indicated better activity of E-3810 both in
terms of tumor stabilization and tumor growth delay [tumor

tested the activity of E-3810 on A498 transplanted orthotopically in the kidney of nude mice, to reproduce the organ
environment of the tumor of origin better (Fig. 3B). Treatment
started on day 17 when the tumors in the kidney were already
detectable (data not shown) and continued for 30 days at the
schedule of 20 mg/kg daily p.o. At the end of treatment, mice
were killed and their kidneys were removed and weighed. E3810 significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited tumor growth (mean 

Finally, we investigated the activity of E-3810 given continuously or intermittently. The antitumor activities were
comparable at the optimal dose schedule (20 mg/kg daily
for 30 days) or in 2 cycles (20 mg/kg daily for 15 days, twice,
with 1 week's interruption; Fig. 3C), with similar tumor
responsiveness to the first and second cycle of therapy. When
A498 tumor bearing mice were treated with sunitinib for
15 days at the optimal reported dose (40 mg/kg daily) then,
after 1 week of suspension, retreated with sunitinib or E-3810
for a second cycle, tumor growth was again stabilized by
E-3810 but continued under sunitinib (Fig. 3D). These data
suggest E-3810 is active in tumors resistant to other antiangiogenic drugs.
E-3810 pharmacokinetics. In pharmacokinetic experiments (Supplementary Fig. 4), E-3810 showed a good oral
bioavailability. The kinetic profile in nude mice indicated a
low-to-moderate clearance and a high volume of distribution.
The terminal half-life was about 4 hours and comparable after
oral and i.v. administration (Supplementary Fig. 4A). The drug
systemic exposure was proportional to the dose and its kinetic
did not change after repeated daily doses (Supplementary
Fig. 4B and C). After single and repeated doses, E-3810 was
measurable in tumors, with concentrations higher than in
plasma (Supplementary Fig. 4D).
In vivo effects on tumor perfusion and permeability
detected by DCE-MRI. Figure 4A shows regions of interest
(ROI), namely the tumor rim and the tumor core, superimposed on an anatomic image. The signal enhancement
at T ¼ 0, 1, and 2, defined as % Enh (t) ¼ 100  (signal at
time t post CA injection  signal preinjection)/signal preinjection, was calculated for the 2 ROIs and for vehicle and E3810 treated animals. As the % Enh (t) is proportional to the
total concentration of CA in the tissue at time t, the analysis
indicates a significant reduction of perfusion in E-3810 treated
tumors compared with baseline values and vehicle-treated
controls, already after only 5 days. To quantify this reduction,
the median of the initial area under the time–signal enhancement curve (IAUC), defined over the first 10 minutes after
injection of contrast medium (IAUC10), was calculated and the

www.aacrjournals.org

results are plotted in Fig. 4B. IAUC10 values differed significantly in control and E-3810 groups.
A 2-compartment model was used to fit the DCE series and
extract, voxel-wise, the fractional plasma volume (fPV; i.e.,
the fPV of the voxel occupied by plasma) and the kinetic
transfer constant Ktrans between the 2 compartments. The
latter reflects the permeability of the tumor capillaries to the
molecule used as CA (in our case the albumin-bound form of
B22956/1). Median pixel values were calculated for each
ROI from the fPV and Ktrans parametric images. Results are
summarized in Supplementary Table S2. There was a general
reduction in the fPV of E-3810 treated mice (though significant only at T1), but no considerable differences in the
permeability to B22956/1.
E-3810 induces vascular regression in human renal carcinoma xenografts. The specific effects of E-3810 on tumor
vasculature from vehicle- and drug-treated animals were
examined using CD31 immunohistochemistry on A498 tumor
xenografts (Fig. 5, left). Vascular density in control A498
tumors did not change significantly during the 12 days of
growth (data not shown). In contrast, there was an 80%
reduction of vascular density in E-3810–treated tumors compared to the time-matched controls. In addition, there was a
decrease in the deposition of collagen IV, detected after
immunostaining for murine collagen IV (Fig. 5, middle),
and an increase in tumor necrosis assessed using H&E stained
sections (Fig. 5, right). All these data parallel the results with
bFGF-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs (Supplementary
Fig. S2) and those on tumor perfusion by DCE-MRI (Fig. 4),
corroborating the strong antiangiogenic effect of E-3810.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacologic profile of E-3810, a dual inhibitor of VEGFR and FGFR
tyrosine kinases. The compound was very active in biochemical assays, inhibiting the kinase activity of VEGFR-1, -2, and
-3; FGFR-1 and -2; and CSF-1R at nanomolar concentrations,
but with much less potency on PDGFR a and b. Our in vitro

and in vivo data are consistent with a key role of the inhibition
of VEGFR and FGFR in the mode of action of E-3810, even if
we cannot rule out the possibility that other important kinases
for tumor cell growth could be affected by E-3810. In vitro
E-3810 inhibits the VEGF- and bFGF-dependent proliferation
and the signaling transduction pathways elicited by VEGF
and bFGF ligands binding to their cognate receptors in
HUVEC cells in the nanomolar range. Much higher concentrations (mM) were needed to interfere in vitro with the growth
of different cell lines in nonligand stimulated conditions,
suggesting that the drug effect on tumor cells occurs at quite
high concentrations and that the drug's primary effect is
inhibition of VEGF and FGF signaling pathways, which are
pivotal in the proliferation and survival of endothelial and
stromal cells. In vivo 7 days of treatment with E-3810 completely inhibited the FGF-induced angiogenesis in an
implanted Matrigel plug in mice; E-3810 treatment significantly reduced tumor vessel density in treated tumors (as
assessed by the decrease in CD31 staining), increasing in the
percentage of tumor necrosis and changing the composition
of tumor stroma (with a decrease in collagen IV content).
These findings were corroborated by DCE-MRI analysis,
which showed that E-3810 reduced the tumor distribution of
the CA, already after only 5 days of treatment. This MRI
evidence suggests that, as for other inhibitors, the antiangiogenic response to E-3810 can be monitored in vivo, with widely
available technology and an established method suitable for
the clinical setting.
All the effects indicate a strong antiangiogenic effect of E3810 that is likely to greatly contribute to its potent antitumor

effect in the human xenografts tested, encompassing ovarian,
renal, and colorectal carcinomas. E-3810's main effect was
tumor stabilization, with regression in some experimental
settings. These results are consistent with the activity reported
for other antiangiogenic compounds in preclinical systems
(33, 34), although E-3810's antitumor effect in our experimental human xenografts was always equal, when not superior, to
sunitinib and brivanib used at their optimal dose schedules
(26, 35). The drug also showed significant antitumor activity in
RXF393 xenografts grown orthotopically in the kidney of nude
mice, reproducing the site of tumor origin. In addition, the
compound displayed a good pharmacokinetic profile: complete oral bioavailability, terminal half-life about 4 hours, and
systemic exposure proportional to the dose with no accumulation after daily treatment. In addition, the observed high
activity of E-3810 in inhibiting in biochemical assay CSF-R1,
could suggest a modulation of tumor-associated macrophage
(TAM) function. It is well known that CSF is the main growth
factor responsible for the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and chemotaxis of mononuclear phagocytes, such as
macrophages (36). CSF-1 has been shown to block the maturation of dentritic cells in tumors in such a way that they are
unable to present antigens and promote immuno-suppresed
trophic TAMs, with a less inflammatory and proangiogenic
phenotype (37, 38). The interference with these processes
might contribute to the drug's antitumor effects.
In all the experimental settings, however, tumor growth
resumed after drug withdrawal, suggesting that continuous
target inhibition is needed. However, tumors responded to a
second cycle of E-3810 to the same extent as to the first cycle

(Fig. 3C) suggesting that tumor regrowth upon treatment
withdrawal is not associated with the development of resistance. In addition, tumors initially treated with sunitinib then
treated with a second cycle of sunitinib or E-3810 were
resistant to sunitinib, but sensitive to E-3810. These data need
to be confirmed in other experimental settings but they do
suggest that the mechanisms underlying resistance to sunitinib can be overridden by E-3810.
The mechanisms for the development of resistance to VEGF
pathway inhibitors in tumors are far from fully elucidated (14,
16, 17), but various alternative angiogenic signaling pathways
have been reported (39–41). For example, placental growth
factor (PIGF), a member of the VEGF family that specifically
binds VEGFR1, was up-regulated in patients treated with
antiangiogenic agents (10, 42). PIGF mRNA was upregulated

www.aacrjournals.org

in mice treated with anti-VEGFR2 antibodies (40), and treatment with anti-PIGF antibody had an additive effect in slowing
tumor growth when combined with anti-VEGFR-2 antibody
(18). FGFs have also been reported to sustain angiogenesis
independently of VEGF (43, 44). In a RIP-tag model, FGF1 and
FGF2 were upregulated in tumors relapsed after treatment
with the anti-VEGFR antibody DC101 (39). Inhibition of the
FGF/FGFR pathway with a FGF-trap (FGFR-Fc fusion peptide)
in this experimental model slowed tumor growth and attenuated tumor angiogenesis. FGF2 was increased in the blood of
patients relapsed after treatment with VEGFR inhibitors (10),
suggesting its role in acquired resistance.
The resistance to sunitinib retreatment we observed
in A498 tumors might be due to a shift from VEGF/VEGFR
to a FGF/FGFR driven angiogenesis, which can be countered

by E-3810, as it is a more potent and specific inhibitor of
FGFRs than sunitinib (35). In biochemical assays FGFR-1 and
-2 were inhibited by E-3810 at the same nanomolar concentrations of VEGFRs, whereas higher concentrations are
needed for sunitinib. Studies are ongoing to prove this.
Besides the role of the FGF/FGFR pathway in driving tumor
angiogenesis, deregulation by activating mutations or ligand/
receptor overexpression may also lead to tumor development
and maintenance (19, 45, 46). Thus, a dual inhibitor of VEGFR
and FGFR is potentially able to inhibit both proangiogenic
pathways and the FGF/FGFR signal required for the growth
and survival of cancer cells. Our data clearly show that E-3810
is a strong inhibitor of angiogenesis, but in tumor cells highly
dependent on FGF/FGFR it may also have some direct antiproliferative or cytotoxic effect. If this is the case, the dual
mechanism of drug action should result in a better clinical
response in patients whose tumor growth depends on FGF/
FGFR.
Overall, this study defines E-3810 as a small tyrosine kinase
molecule with a potent antiangiogenic effect, a favorable
pharmacokinetic profile, a broad spectrum of antitumor

activity, and good tolerability, providing a strong rationale
for its clinical investigation.
