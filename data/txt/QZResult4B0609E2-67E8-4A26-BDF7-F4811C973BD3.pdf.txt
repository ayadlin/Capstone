ABSTRACT
Hypoxia leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) imbalance, which is proposed to
associate with drug resistance and oncogenesis. Inhibition of enzymes of antioxidant
balancing system in tumor cells was shown to reduce chemoresistance under hypoxia.
However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The key regulator of antioxidant
balancing system is nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, Nrf2). In
this study, we showed that hypoxia induced ROS production and increased the Nrf2
activity. Nrf2 activation increased levels of its downstream target antioxidant enzymes,
including GCLC and GCLM. The Nrf2-overexpressing also confers chemo-resistant MCF7
cells under normoxia. The in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that the chemical
inhibition of Nrf2 can increase cisplatin (CDDP) cytotoxicity. Together, these results
showed that Nrf2 serves as a key regulator in chemotherapeutic resistance under
hypoxia through ROS-Nrf2-GCLC-GSH pathway. Therefore, targeting Nrf2 can be a
potential treatment for hypoxia-induced drug resistance in breast cancer cells.

of GSH production with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) has
been shown to inhibit the chemoresistance of tumor cells
[18, 19]. These phenomena reveal that antioxidant ability
is critically associated with chemoresistance in cancer
cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypoxia may lead to
oxidative stress, and activate antioxidant enzymes to cause
hypoxia-induced drug resistance.
The master transcription factor responsible for
coordinating antioxidant activity is nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, Nrf2) [20]. Under
oxidative stresses, Nrf2 translocates from cytoplasm into
nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element
(ARE), which leads to the transcription and translation of
phase II antioxidant enzymes, including NAD(P)H quinine
oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligase
catalytic subunit (GCLC), and glutamate-cysteine ligase
modifier subunit (GCLM) [21]. GCLC and GCLM can
bind to each other as a heterodimer to promote the synthesis
of GSH [22], which is responsible for the intracellular
redox homeostasis and chemical detoxification. It has been
reported that the inhibition of Nrf2 can sensitize some
lung carcinoma cells to chemotherapeutic drugs under
normoxic culture conditions [23], but the role of Nrf2 in

INTRODUCTION
As the solid tumors grow in size, the blood vessels
are often defective and cannot supply sufficient oxygen
to the tumor tissue, thus producing a low-oxygen
microenvironment in a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia
leads to the intracellular oxidative imbalance [1], and also
leads to many genetic and metabolic alterations in tumor
cells [2-5]. Tumor hypoxia has been shown to increase
tumor metastasis [6], and radio- or chemo-therapeutic
resistance [7, 8], thus serves as a prognostic marker of poor
clinical outcome [9, 10],
Hypoxia also confers resistance to commonly used
chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin (CDDP) [11],
carboplatin [8], and doxorubicin [7], in colorectal [12], lung
[11], prostate [7], and breast tumors [13]. Many mechanisms
have been suggested to be responsible for the hypoxiainduced drug resistance [8]. One prominent potential
critical mediator is glutathione (GSH) [14]. Overexpression
of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes, which
catalyzes the conjugation of the GSH to substrates for
detoxification, has been implicated in the resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents [15–17]. In addition, the inhibition

is not well understood. Here, we investigate the role of
Nrf2 in hypoxia-induced drug resistance and find Nrf2
is the key regulator for hypoxia-induced drug resistance,
and targeting Nrf2 can facilitate the treatment efficiency
of cisplatin.

Solid tumors are usually more resistant to
chemotherapy and are associated with a poor prognosis
in hypoxic microenvironments [9, 10]. To demonstrate
the role of hypoxia in drug resistance, the hypoxic
microenvironment was mimicked by a hypoxic chamber
with a 2% O2 atmosphere. To examine the drug resistance
of tumor cells under hypoxia, MCF7 cells were exposed
to a common clinical chemotherapeutic medicine, cisplatin
(CDDP), in normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (2% O2)
conditions. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.
The cell viabilities in MCF7 cells increased significantly
under hypoxia compared with normoxia after 24 hours
of treatment at all concentrations of CDDP (Figure 1A).
To further understand the time-dependent cytotoxicity of
CDDP on cells, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml CDDP,
and cell viability was measured at different time points
between 4 and 48 hours. The cell viabilities with CDDP
treatment under hypoxia were significantly increased
at 24 and 48 hours compared to normoxia (Figure 1B).
The IC50 value of MCF7 cells was significantly increased
under hypoxia compared to normoxia at 24 (hypoxia:
2.61±0.07 μg/ml, normoxia: 1.01±0.18 μg/ml) and 48
hours (hypoxia: 1.40±0.18 μg/ml, normoxia: 0.51±0.15
μg/ml) (Figure 1C). These results showed that the hypoxic
microenvironment leads to a higher drug resistance in
cancer cells.

Therefore, the protein levels of Hif-1α and several major
phase II antioxidant enzymes (NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM)
under hypoxia were measured by western blotting. The
Hif-1α protein level was significantly increased, which
was indicative of hypoxic conditions. The GCLC and
GCLM protein levels increased at 8 and 24 hours, whereas
the NQO1 level did not change under hypoxia (Figure
2B). The GCLC level reached significance at 8 and 24
hours, and the significance of GCLM was shown at 24
hours (Supplementary Figure S1A). GCLC and GCLM
proteins together assemble an enzyme, glutamate cysteine
ligase (GCL), which regulates the GSH synthesis and
the capacity of antioxidants [22]. To verify the function
of GCLC/GCLM proteins, a GSH assay kit was used to
detect the total GSH (tGSH) content. Compared with the
0-hour group, the 4-, 8-, and 24-hour groups exhibited an
increased intracellular tGSH level under hypoxia (Figure
2C). In summary, hypoxia-induced GCLC/GCLM led to
GSH production to balance the intracellular ROS levels.
The cytotoxic effect of CDDP mainly resulted
from the inhibition of DNA replication and the induction
of apoptosis through the ROS pathway [29]. Therefore,
an increase of antioxidant capacity may lead to CDDP
resistance. To further understand whether the increased
GCLC activities was correlated to hypoxia-induced
drug resistance, cells were transfected with siRNAs
specifically targeted to Hif-1α, GCLC, or NQO1, and the
drug resistance under normoxic and hypoxic conditions
was examined. The knockdown efficiency of siRNAs was
measured by western blot (Figure 2D), and the statistic
results were shown in Supplementary Figure S1B. Then,
the cell viability was tested by MTT assay. The cell
survival rate of combination treatment of CDDP and GCLC
knockdown, but not the knockdown of other siRNAs, was
significantly reduced under hypoxia compared with CDDP
alone (Figure 2E). Together, these results indicate that the
expression and antioxidant function of GCLC is important
in drug resistance under hypoxia.

Regulation of GCLC leads to the alteration of
drug resistance under hypoxia

Activation of Nrf2 leads to drug resistance under
hypoxia

Previous reports have demonstrated that hypoxia
can increase intracellular ROS level [24–26]. ROS are
toxic but also function as signaling transduction molecules
[27]. Hypoxia-induced ROS, particularly that of H2O2, has
been reported to be involved in the regulation of hypoxic
responses [28]. However, the physiological contexts
and phenotypes of hypoxia-increased ROS are not fully
understood. Therefore, the intracellular ROS levels were
determined at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours under hypoxia by
flow cytometry with DCFHDA staining. Compared to the
control cells at 0 hour, the ROS level increased at 4 hours,
decreased at 8 hours, and then increased again at 24 hours
under hypoxia (Figure 2A). The change in ROS levels
suggested that hypoxia altered the antioxidant ability.

Nrf2 is a transcription factor and the translocation
of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus can
increase the transcriptional activities of downstream
antioxidant genes [21], including GCLC and GCLM.
However, it is unclear whether Nrf2 is involved in the
hypoxia-induced drug resistance of cancer cells. To test
this possibility, the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was
examined by immunocytochemistry (ICC) and nuclear
protein detection assays. The nuclear translocation of
Nrf2 (green fluorescence) was dramatically increased at 8
and 24 h. Overlaying the images of Nrf2 and DAPI (cyan
fluorescence, used as a nucleus indicator) confirmed the
nuclear location of Nrf2 (Figure 3A). The quantitative
analysis of cells with Nrf2 positive nucleus were shown

in Supplementary Figure S2A, the percentage of Nrf2
positive nucleus increased dramatically from 4 to 24 hours
compared to 0 hour under hypoxia. In western blotting,
the total Nrf2 expression was significantly increased at
24 h (Figure 3B), and the quantified results of Nrf2 were
shown in Supplementary Figure S2B. Hif-1α was used
as a hypoxic indicator. Similar results were shown in
the nuclear (N)/cytoplasmic (C) fractions, and Nrf2 was
significantly increased in the nucleus at 8 and 24 hours.
GAPDH and histone H3 were used as the loading controls
for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Figure 3C), and the
quantified results were shown in Supplementary Figure
S2C. The results of ARE luciferase reporter assay also
showed a significant increase in Nrf2 activity at 8 and
24 hours under hypoxia (Figure 3D). To further clarify
whether the Nrf2 activity was associated with drug
resistance under hypoxia, cells were treated with siRNA
targeting Nrf2 or with a specific Nrf2 inhibitor, trigonelline
[30], to inhibit Nrf2 activity. The inhibition efficiencies
of siRNA and trigonelline were first verified, as shown in
Supplementary Figures S3A and S3B. Thus, based on the
cell viabilities, the combination treatment of CDDP with
Nrf2 siRNA and trigonelline significantly enhanced the
drug sensitivity of CDDP under hypoxia (Figure 3E, 3F).
In addition, it has been reported that multidrug
resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP-1) can efflux the
chemotherapeutic drugs out of cells to decrease drug
efficacy in cancer cells [31]. Interestingly, we found that

the MRP-1 protein level was inhibited by trigonelline under
hypoxia (Figure 3G), and the quantified results of MRP1 were shown in Supplementary Figure S3C. This finding
suggested that Nrf2 not only regulates the balance of ROS
homeostasis but also may be involved in drug efflux to
increase drug resistance under hypoxia. Together, these
results indicated that hypoxia-induced Nrf2 activation is
very important in drug resistance under hypoxia.

Nrf2 activation is increased by hypoxia-induced
intracellular ROS production
Previous studies have shown that Nrf2 activity is
induced by ROS imbalance [32], and many studies have
reported ROS imbalance under hypoxia. Therefore, we
assumed that ROS imbalance maybe a key modulator of
hypoxia-induced Nrf2 activity. To further understand the
role of hypoxia-induced ROS in Nrf2 activation, MCF7 cells
were pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT, a ROS scavenger)
for 2 hours, and then treated with CDDP under hypoxia
for 24 hours. The intracellular ROS level was increased
dramatically in the group with the combination of DTT
pretreatment and CDDP compared with the CDDP alone
group (Figure 4A). This result showed that pretreatment
with DTT could inhibit the ROS balance system and lead
to greater oxidative stress with CDDP treatment under
hypoxia. To confirm the relationship between hypoxiainduced ROS and Nrf2 activity, the translocation of Nrf2

was detected by ICC method. Overlaying the Nrf2 (green
fluorescence) and DAPI (cyan fluorescence) in hypoxia
group showed the translocation of Nrf2, and the DTT
pretreatment can reverse the translocation of Nrf2 (Figure
4B). Then, to demonstrate the relationship between hypoxiainduced ROS and drug resistance, MCF7 cells were treated
with a combination of CDDP and pretreatment of DTT or
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, another ROS scavenger) under
hypoxia, and the cell viability was significantly decreased
compared to the CDDP group (Figure 4C).
To further demonstrate whether ROS is the key regulator
of hypoxia-induced Nrf2 activity and drug resistance, MCF7
cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 20,
40, 80, 100 μM) for 24 hours, and the cell viability showed that
the cytotoxic effect of H2O2 on MCF7 cells was greater while
the concentration reached 80 μM (Supplementary Figure S4).
Therefore, 40 μM H2O2 was chosen to activate Nrf2 without
causing cell death in the following experiments. MCF7 cells
were treated with 40 μM H2O2 for 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours, and the
intracellular ROS levels were detected by flow cytometry with
DCFHDA staining. Surprisingly, the ROS level changed under
H2O2 treatment in the normoxia group showed a similar pattern
(Figure 4D) to the previous result under hypoxic conditions
(Figure 2A): the ROS level increased slightly at 4 hours,
decreased at 8 hours, and increased again at 24 hours. This
result indicated that the ROS imbalance under hypoxia may be
the same as that with 40 μM H2O2 treatment under normoxia.
Previous studies have indicated that ROS may act
as a signaling molecule to activate Nrf2 [32]. As shown in
Figure 4E, overlaying Nrf2 (green fluorescence) and DAPI
(cyan fluorescence) in the H2O2 treated group confirmed
the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. In addition, Nrf2
activity was significantly increased with H2O2 treatment,
as measured by the luciferase reporter assay (Figure 4F).
Furthermore, the cell viability was dramatically increased
with combination treatment of CDDP and H2O2 compared
to the CDDP group under normoxia (Figure 4G). Together,
these results indicated that Nrf2 activity was increased by
hypoxia-induced ROS production.

cells were treated with CDDP for 24 hours, and cell
viability was measured by MTT assay. The results showed
that the drug resistance was significantly increased in
Nrf2-expressing cells (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the Nrf2expressing cells were treated by CDDP combined with
BSO (GCLC inhibitor), Dicoumarol (NQO1 inhibitor)
or siGCLC RNA. CDDP treatment combined with BSO
(Figure 5C) or siGCLC RNA (Figure 5D) significantly
decreased the drug resistance in Nrf2-expressing cells.
Then, a stable Nrf2-overexpressing cell line, MCF7Nrf2, was established by neomycin selection. MCF7-Nrf2
cells showed more nuclear translocation of Nrf2 than normal
MCF7 cells (Figure 5E). In contrast, the protein levels of
Nrf2 and GCLC were significantly increased in MCF7-Nrf2
cells; the quantified results were shown in Supplementary
Figure S6A. Nrf2 activity was also significantly increased in
MCF7-Nrf2 cells, as measured by luciferase reporter assay
(Figure 5F). With a cell viability assay, similar results were
observed: MCF7-Nrf2 cells were more resistant to CDDP
than MCF7 cells (Figure 5G). To confirm whether Nrf2 is
the key regulator of drug resistance, cells were transfected
with siNrf2 to inhibit the expression of Nrf2 and treated
with CDDP for 24 hours. The drug resistance induced
by Nrf2 overexpression was blocked by siNrf2 (Figure
5G). Similarly, MDAMB231 cells, which had higher Nrf2
expression (Supplementary Figure S6B), were treated with
a combination of CDDP and trigonelline under hypoxia, and
the drug sensitivity of CDDP was significantly enhanced
under hypoxia (Figure 5H). These results suggest that
Nrf2 activity in cancer cells plays an important role in drug
resistance.

The combination treatment of CDDP and
trigonelline treated breast cancers efficiently
in the in vivo mouse model, and the TCGA breast
cancer data showed that Nrf2 is an important
index of the survival rate of patients
To determine whether our findings would be
relevant in an in vivo xenograft model, MCF7 cells were
injected into the ears of 10-week-old male ICR mice.
Mice were randomly separated into four groups treated
with PBS, CDDP, CDDP combined with trigonelline
or trigonelline alone. The conditions of tumor growth
on days 5 and 11 were photographed (Figure 6A). The
mice were sacrificed on day 11, and the tumors were
removed for photography. The tumor size of the CDDP
and trigonelline combination group was smaller than that
of the CDDP alone group (Figure 6A), the third panel,
dashed lines). The tumors treated with a combination of
CDDP and trigonelline were significantly smaller than
those of the PBS or CDDP treatment alone groups on day
11. The tumor volumes were also measured on days 5, 7,
9, and 11 after cell injection, and the volumes in the group
treated with a combination of CDDP and trigonelline were
less than those of the other groups, reaching significance

Nrf2 contributes to the increase of drug
resistance
Nrf2 is well-known for its role in antioxidant
regulation [20], and was responsible for drug resistance
in our results. Hypoxia-induced ROS imbalance increased
Nrf2 activity and enhanced the cell protection mechanism
under chemotherapy. Therefore, transient and stable
Nrf2 expression systems were used to verify whether the
activation of Nrf2 is the key regulator of drug resistance.
First, MCF7 cells were transfected with the vector control
(vector) or Nrf2 plasmid (Nrf2). The protein levels of Nrf2
and the downstream phase II enzymes NQO1, GCLC,
and GCLM were all significantly increased in the Nrf2
overexpression group (Figure 5A), and the quantified
results were shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Then,

on day 11 (Figure 6A and 6B). Since the Nrf2 activation
can be indicated by the phosphorylation of Nrf2 [33], the
Nrf2 activity was confirmed by IHC method with antiphospho-Nrf2 antibody in tumor sections (Supplementary
Figure S7). Results showed that Nrf2 activity (green
fluorescence) was decreased in the treatment group of
CDDP and trigonelline combination compared to the
control or CDDP treatment group. The nucleus (cyan
fluorescence) also expressed an abnormal shape in the
combination group, and this phenotype of nucleus may
illustrate the cell death. The results showed that Nrf2
inhibition can increase the chemotherapeutic sensitivity
and narrow the tumor size significantly. To further clarify
the association between Nrf2 expression and the clinical

outcome, TCGA breast cancer datasets were used. The
data matrices were classified by ER (estrogen receptor),
PR (progesterone receptor), and HER2 (human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2) status. Relapse-free survival
data showed that breast cancer patients with low Nrf2
expression had a lower incidence of relapse compare to
those with high Nrf2 expression in the PR+/ER+ (p<0.05)
or TNBC (Triple negative breast cancer) groups. This
analysis suggested that high Nrf2 expression can be a
poor prognostic indicator in breast cancers. In conclusion,
Nrf2 plays the key regulator in drug sensitivity of in vitro
and in vivo models, and Nrf2 may be a potential target for
treating drug resistance in breast tumors, especially under
hypoxia microenvironment.

DISCUSSION

drug for breast cancers, especially TNBC without target
therapeutics [39]. Similarly, the inhibition of Nrf2 can
significantly decrease CDDP resistance in both Nrf2expressing MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells under hypoxia
(Figure 5G, 5H).
Hif-1α expression has been associated with the
chemo-resistance of cancer cells by inhibiting apoptosis
and induction of drug efflux [40, 41]. Surprisingly, we
found that Hif-1α may be not the major regulator in
hypoxia-induced drug resistance in our model. Inhibition
of Hif-1α by siRNA did not significantly decrease CDDP
resistance under hypoxia (Figure 2E). In addition, Nrf2
increased the expression of antioxidant protein (GCLC/
GCLM) and detoxification protein (MRP-1) (Figure
2B, Figure 3G). The results suggested that Nrf2 activity
may be more important than Hif-1α in causing hypoxia–
induced CDDP resistance through the ARE-mediated
transcriptional regulation.
Previous studies have indicated hypoxia leads to
intracellular oxidative imbalance [1]. This concept is
supported by the highly dynamic ROS levels at different time
points under hypoxia. In this study, Hypoxia-induced ROS at
4h leads to the activation of Nrf2, and decrease the ROS at 8
hours. At 8 hours, we also observed an increase in the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2. At 24 hours, even though the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 is more dramatic than 8h (Figure 2A,
4D), this increased Nrf2 may not be able to cope with the
hypoxia-induced ROS accumulation, thus resulting in another
ROS surge. These data suggested that Nrf2 is upregulated by
the ROS imbalance caused by hypoxia.

The chemoresistance caused by hypoxia contribute
significantly to these poor treatment outcomes. Therefore,
understanding the key regulatory factors for hypoxiainduced chemoresistance is critical to improve cancer
treatments. Nrf2 is regarded as a pro-tumorigenic factor
in many tumor types by accelerating stress adaption,
increasing drug resistance and driving oncogenesis [34–
37]. Although the connection between Nrf2 and hypoxiainduced drug resistance remains unknown. In this study, we
dissected the causal role of Nrf2 activation for the hypoxiainduced drug resistance in breast cancer cells. We have
provided compelling experimental evidence by showing
that hypoxia increases the drug resistance of MCF7 through
Nrf2 activation. The Nrf2 activation was triggered by
hypoxia-induced ROS, and the downstream GCLC enzyme
was essential to increase the glutathione content to detoxify
the cytotoxicity of CDDP. Therefore, the hypoxia-induced
ROS-Nrf2-GCLC pathway increases the drug resistance and
likely causes treatment failure in breast cancer cells. The
underlying mechanism of hypoxia-induced drug resistance
is schematically depicted in Figure 7.
In clinic, TNBC is considered to be a tumor types
with strong drug resistance and poor response to treatment
[38]. The TCGA data showed that the TNBC group has
a lower survival rate compared with the ER+/PR+ group
(Figure 6C, 6D). In both ER+/PR+ and TNBC group,
patients with higher Nrf2 level got lower survival rate
(Figure 6). CDDP is a common first-line chemotherapeutic

Figure 7: Model of Nrf2-induced drug resistance under hypoxia. A schematic diagram of Nrf2-induced drug resistance under

hypoxia and the modulation in MCF7 was shown. Nrf2 activity was evoked by the hypoxia-induced ROS imbalance, and the downstream
GCLC enzyme was essential to increase the glutathione content to detoxify the cytotoxicity of CDDP. siNrf2, trigonelline, siGCLC, and
BSO can block hypoxia-induced drug resistance, and may be useful as therapeutic agents combined with chemotherapeutic drugs.

In summary, our study suggests the important role of
the hypoxia-induced ROS-Nrf2-GCLC-GSH pathway in the
hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Targeting Nrf2 could be
a potential therapy to decrease drug resistance and improve
the treatment of solid breast tumors. Nrf2 activation can
be a good marker for the selection of chemoresistant cells
that most likely benefit from combined therapy with Nrf2
inhibitors to reduce hypoxia-induced drug resistance.

transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were blocked with 5% milk for 1 hour and incubated with
targeted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, and then
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at
room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, the signals were
enhanced by ECL (Millipore) and detected with X-film
exposure. Protein levels were quantified with Gel-Pro
analyzer software and normalized to GAPDH.

used to purify the nuclear proteins. Cells (2×105) were
cultured in 6-well plates and incubated for the indicated
treatments, the cell pellets were collected by trypsinEDTA, vortexed intensely in 200 μl ice-cold CER I for
15 seconds, and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Then,
samples were washed in cold CER II, vortexed intensely
for 5 seconds, and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes.
The supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts.
The pellets were vortexed in 50 μl ice-cold NER for 15
seconds and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes and
centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. The
supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts.

Cell culture
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and
MDAMB231 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at
37°C. MCF7-Nrf2 cells were established with stable Nrf2
overexpression and were selected by G418 (400 μg/ml)
for up to 4 weeks. The Nrf2 protein level was measured by
western blotting every week to ensure the expression of Nrf2.

Immunofluorescence

Cells were cultured in 96-well plates and incubated
for 24 hours. After treatments for the indicated times, 500
μg/ml MTT was added to cells for 2 hours. Then, the MTT
crystal was dissolved by DMSO, and the OD absorbance
was measured with an ELISA reader at 550 nm.

Cells were cultured on coverslips coated with 0.1%
gelatin (Sigma) and incubated for the indicated treatments.
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes,
blocked with 10% FBS with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 15
minutes, and incubated with targeted primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, then incubated with secondary antibodies
at room temperature for 1 hour, and incubated with 0.4%
DAPI for 10 minutes. The samples were mounted on the
slides with mounting medium (Ibidi), and the images were
captured by fluorescent microscopy (Leica).

luciferase gene and pRL-CMV (Promega) containing
a Renilla luciferase plasmid. After the treatments, cells
were collected with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-base, Ph
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), the DualGlo luciferase assay reagent was added to the samples
and incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C, and the firefly
luminescence activities were measured (Berthold). Then,
Dual-Glo Stop & Glo reagent was added to the samples
and incubated for another 10 minutes at 25°C. The Renilla
luminescence activities were measured in the luminometer,
and normalized by the Renilla activities.

length×maximum width× height”. The mice were sacrificed
on day 11, and tumor status was photographed.

TCGA database analysis

Cells (2×105) were incubated with 10 μM
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) (Molecule
Probe) for 30 minutes at 37°C, and collected by trypsinEDTA. The samples were analyzed by FACS Calibur flow
cytometry with FL1-H parameters (BD Biosciences).

Clinical data were obtained from the TCGA openaccess database. The breast cancer matrix dataset was
downloaded from the breast invasive carcinoma [BRCA]
database, including vital status, tumor status, overall
survival, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) statuses. The matrix dataset was classified into the
ER/PR positive (ER+/PR+) group and the triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC, ER-/PR-/HER2-) group according
to tumor status. Two subgroups were further identified
as high and low Nrf2 expression subgroups by the Nrf2
expression in both ER+/PR+ and TNBC groups. Tumors
with Nrf2 level above the mean of all Nrf2 expression
were identified as high Nrf2 expression, and others were
grouped as low Nrf2 expression.

Plasmid and siRNA transfection

Statistical analysis

Cells (2×105) were cultured in each well of the
6-well plates and incubated for 24 hours, and the mixed
reagent containing plasmid or siRNA with transfection
reagent (Omic Bio) was added, which was previously
incubated for 20 minutes, for 24 hours, and the levels of
target proteins were examined by western blot.

All experiments were performed at least 3 times.
Statistical significance between groups was determined by
Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA. The overall TCGA
data were imported into GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, Inc.) and examined by the Mantel-Cox log-rank
test. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
