Abstract
5,6-Di-methylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is a small
molecule in the flavanoid class that has antitumor activity.
Although classified as a ‘‘vascular disrupting agent,’’ we have
recently conducted studies showing that DMXAA has remarkable efficacy in a range of tumors, working primarily as an
immune modulator that activates tumor-associated macrophages and induces a subsequent CD8+ T-cell–mediated
response. To more completely analyze the effect of DMXAA
on CD8+ T-cell generation, we treated mice bearing tumors
derived from EG7 thymoma cells that express the wellcharacterized chicken ovalbumin neotumor antigen. Treatment with DMXAA led to cytokine release, tumor cell necrosis,
and ultimately reduction in tumor size that was lymphocyte
dependent. Within 24 h of administration, we observed
dendritic cell activation in tumor-draining lymph nodes
(TDLN). This was followed by a rapid and marked increase
in the number of tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleens
of treated animals. In contrast, the vascular disrupting agent
combretastatin A4-phosphate, which caused a similar amount
of immediate tumor necrosis, did not activate dendritic cells,
nor induce an effective antitumor response. Using in vitro
systems, we made the observation that DMXAA has the ability
to directly activate mouse dendritic cells, as measured by
increased expression of costimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokine release via a pathway that does not
require the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule MyD88.
DMXAA thus has the ability to activate tumor-specific CD8+
T cells through multiple pathways that include induction of
tumor cell death, release of stimulatory cytokines, and direct
activation of dendritic cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):7011–9]

Introduction
5,6-Di-methylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is a small
molecule in the flavanoid class that has antitumor activity
thought to be due to its ability to induce high local levels of
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) that disrupt established blood
vessels within tumors (1, 2). The drug has completed phase 1
testing in humans and is currently in phase II trials in
combination with chemotherapy (3–5). Although often character-

ized as a ‘‘vascular disrupting agent,’’ we have recently conducted
studies showing that DMXAA has remarkable efficacy in a range
of tumors, but primarily as an immune modulator that requires a
biphasic effect for efficacy (6). First, DMXAA activates tumorassociated macrophages to release a variety of immunostimulatory cytokines and chemokines. This leads to vascular necrosis
and some initial tumor regression. However, for effective tumor
treatment, a subsequent CD8+ T-cell–mediated response is
required.
The exact nature and mechanisms by which this antitumor CD8+
T cell response is generated by DMXAA is unknown. Tumor
necrosis induced by vascular disruption and subsequent ischemia/
reperfusion might lead to enhanced cell death, antigen release, and
subsequent cross-priming. Macrophage activation and release of
cytokines within the tumor might allow direct antigen presentation
by macrophages or cytokine-mediated activation of dendritic cells
(DC). However, given the effect of DMXAA on macrophages, we
also explored the possibility that it might directly activate another
myeloid-derived cell line, DCs.
The purpose of this study was to more carefully analyze the
effect of DMXAA on CD8+ T cell generation. To facilitate this, we
chose to study the EG7 thymoma system. EG7 cells express the
chicken ovalbumin neotumor antigen (7). The dominant MHC class
I peptide from ovalbumin (SIINFEKL) has been well characterized
in C57B6 mice, and tetramers are available to specifically track
these cells.
We show that DMXAA is effective in EG7 tumors, and that this
effect is T cell dependent. Treatment with DMXAA led to rapid
cytokine release and tumor cell necrosis. Within 24 h, we also
observed DC activation in both the tumor-draining lymph nodes
(TDLN) and in non-TDLNs. This was followed by a marked
increase in the number of tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells in the
spleens of treated animals. However, tumor cell death alone, as
induced by the vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A4phosphate (CA4P), did not induce DC activation in the TDLN, did
not increase the number of tetramer-positive cells, and was not an
effective antitumor agent. Using in vitro systems, we made the
observation that DMXAA has the ability to directly activate mouse
DC, as measured by increased expression of costimulatory
molecules and proinflammatory cytokine release via a pathway
that does not require the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule
MyD88 and has different kinetics than known DC activators such
as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or stimulatory oligonucleotides.
DMXAA thus has the ability to activate tumor-specific CD8+
T cells through multiple pathways that include induction of tumor
cell death, release of stimulatory cytokines, and direct activation
of DCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. EG7 is a murine thymoma cell line transfected with an OVA
cDNA construct on a C57/B6 background (7) and was provided by Wolfgang
Weninger (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). EG7 cells were cultured and
maintained in G418 selection media consisting of RPMI supplemented with
100 mg/mL G418, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 100 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, and 2.5% h-mercaptoethanol. This cell line was regularly tested
and maintained negative for Mycoplasma contamination.
Mice. Pathogen-free female C57/B6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were
purchased from Taconic Laboratories or the Jackson Laboratory. Severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were purchased from the Wistar
Institute. MyD88 / mice were kindly provided by Dr. S. Akira (Research
Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka, Japan; ref. 8) and were on the B6
background, backcrossed at least seven generations. Tlr3 / knock-out
mice were a kind gift from Dr. Richard Flavell at Yale University. Animals
were housed in the animal facility at the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA)
or the University Laboratory Animal Resources facility of the University of
Pennsylvania. The Animal Use Committees of the Wistar Institute and
University of Pennsylvania approved all protocols in compliance with the
care and use of animals.
Animal tumor models. Tumors were established with s.c. flank
injections of 1  106 single cell suspensions in 100 AL PBS. Tumors were
measured twice weekly, and volumes were estimated using the formula
3.14  [largest diameter  (perpendicular diameter)2]/6. Treatment was
administered when tumors were f200 to 300 mm3 in size. Tumors were
harvested in some studies at specified times (see below) for analysis. In
other studies, mice were followed for tumor growth and sacrificed when the
tumors became >10% body weight or the animals showed signs of distress.
All experiments had at least five mice per group and were repeated at least
once.
Reagents. The sodium salt of DMXAA was synthesized at the Auckland
Cancer Society Research Center (9). DMXAA was formulated in normal
saline and (unless otherwise stated) administered by i.p. injections at a
dose of 18 mg/kg in 200 AL saline. CA4P was provided by OXiGene, Inc.
The CpG oligodeoxynucleotide TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT, known as
CpG 1668, was synthesized on a phosphorothioate backbone (Integrated
DNA technologies).
Protein studies for cytokine and chemokine levels. To compare
changes in cytokine and chemokine protein levels within tumors, mice
bearing EG7 flank tumors (n = 3 in each group) that were f200 to 300 mm3
in size were treated with DMXAA. Tumors were harvested after 24 h and
sonicated for 30 s in 1 mL of complete buffer [50 mL PBS containing one
tablet of antiprotease cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)]. Tissues were then
spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and filtered through a 1.2-Am syringe filter
unit. Total protein in each sample was determined. Mouse cytokine
expression was measured using a mouse cytokine bead Lincoplex kit using
Luminex 100 IS instrument as previously described (6). Samples were
analyzed for TNF-a, KC/CXCL1, IP10/CXCL10, MCP-1/CCL2, regulated
upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5,
MIP-1a, IFN-g, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-10, and IL-6. The concentration of
cytokines were determined from a standard curve assayed at the same time
with known amounts of recombinant proteins.
In vivo DC activation. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with saline,
DMXAA, or CA4P for 24 h. Draining and nondraining lymph nodes were
isolated and harvested from euthanized mice and made into single cell
suspensions by straining through a 70-Am filter with PBS with 10% FBS.
Lymphocytes were washed, counted, and pooled. Fc receptors were
blocked with antimouse unconjugated CD16/32 antibody (BD PharMingen) for 15 min followed by washing. Lymph node cells were then
incubated for 50 min at 4jC with anti-CD45, CD11c, CD86, CD80, CD40,
and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibodies (BD PharMingen). Stained cells were analyzed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences), and
data analysis was done using FloJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). Histogram
plots for CD86, CD80, CD40, and ICAM-1 expression was established for
CD45+/CD11c+ DC.

Tetramer staining. To investigate the number and distribution of
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, tumor-bearing mice were treated with saline,
DMXAA, or CA4P. Spleen and draining lymph nodes were harvested 5 days
after treatment. Tissues were crushed and strained through a 70-Am filter
with PBS with 10% FBS. RBC were lysed with lysing buffer (BD PharMingen)
for 15 min at room temperature. Single suspension cells are filtered and
washed twice. One million cells were Fc-blocked with antimouse
unconjugated CD16/32 antibody for 15 min followed by washing. Cells
were then incubated 30 min at room temperature in APC-labeled
ovalbumin iTAG tetramers (Beckman-Coulter Immunomics) loaded with
the OVA peptide SIINFEKL. After 30 min, cell surface antibodies for CD8
were added for an additional 30 min. Samples were washed and fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde, and flow cytometry was done. The percentage of
antigen-specific cells was determined by first gating on lymphocytes (based
on size) and then gating on CD8+/tetramer+ lymphocytes.
Pathologic studies. Animals bearing flank tumors were treated with i.p.
injections of PBS, DMXAA, or CA4P at the doses described above. Three
mice per group were euthanized 24 h after treatment, tumors harvested and
immediately placed in formalin and later embedded in paraffin. Sections of
5 Am were cut followed by H&E histologic staining done according to
established protocols. Tumor necrosis was quantified using image analysis
to determine the percentage of necrotic versus viable tumor in multiple
sections (>8) per tumor by a blinded observer.
DC culture. Bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDC) were cultured using
modifications to a previously described protocol (10): In 24-well plates,
1  106 total bone marrow cells per well were seeded in 1 mL Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1.5 Amol/L
2-ME, 3 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and
3 ng/mL IL-4. On day 2, another 1 mL of supplemented media was
added, and every other day thereafter, 1 mL of old media was removed
and replaced with fresh media. After 7 days of culture, the cells were
harvested, washed thoroughly, and used. In some experiments, BMDCs
were enriched using magnetic beads to a purity of at least greater than
93% CD11c+ cells. Briefly, 1 AL biotinylated anti-CD11c antibodies (BD
PharMingen) per 15  106 cells was added to cells suspended in at least
500 AL buffer comprised of PBS with 2 mmol/L EDTA and 0.5% bovine
serum albumin. After 30 min at 4jC, cells were washed with buffer
and labeled with MACS Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec)
per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then positively selected
using MACS LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) and washed before use in
experiments.
In vitro DC activation. About 2–6  105 BMDCs were cultured in
96-well round-bottom plates in complete IMDM, with or without the
addition of 0.5 Amol/L CpG DNA, 100 ng/mL LPS (Ultrapure LPS,
InvivoGen), or graded concentrations of DMXAA. In some experiments,
1 Ag/mL polymyxin B (Sigma) was added to all cultures to neutralize LPS
activity. After 24 h, cell-free supernatants were collected, and cells were
harvested. Cytokine concentrations in supernatants were determined by
commercial ELISA kits (OptEIA, BD PharMingen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed, FcgII/III receptors were
blocked (Fc Block, BD PharMingen), followed by staining with surface
antibodies to CD11c and CD86 for flow-cytometric analysis.
RNA isolation and real-time, reverse transcription-PCR. Quantitation
of BMDC mRNA levels was done as previously described (6). BMDCs were
prepared as described above, and on day 7 of culture, LPS (100 ng/mL), CpG
DNA (0.5 Amol/L) DMXAA (150 Ag/mL), or PBS (control) was added. After
1 and 6 h, at least 1  106 cells were harvested from each condition and total
RNA isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit/QIAshredder spin homogenizer
(Qiagen Inc.). RNA (3 Ag) from each condition was reversed transcribed
using 0.5 Ag oligo(dT) (Promega), 1 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates
(Clonetech), and 1 unit PowerScript reverser transcriptase in First-Strand
Buffer and 10 mmol/L DTT (Clonetech) for 60 min at 42jC. Equal amounts
of cDNA from each condition was pooled. Primers were obtained from the
literature or designed using standard protocols. Primer sequences can be
obtained from the authors upon request. Semiquantitative analysis of gene
expression was done using a Cepheid Smart Cycler following the

manufacturer’s protocol for SYBR Green kit supplied by Roche. cDNA
concentrations from each gene pool were normalized using h-actin as a
control gene. Relative levels of expression of each of the selected gene ( fold
change versus saline control) were determined. Each sample was run in
triplicate or quadruplicate.
Statistical analysis. Unless otherwise noted, data comparing differences
between two groups were assessed using unpaired Student’s t tests. Multiple
comparisons were made using ANOVA with appropriate post hoc testing.
Differences were considered significant when P value was <0.05.

Results
DMXAA is effective in EG7 tumors, induces cytokines, and
causes tumor necrosis. To study specific mechanisms involved in
the immune response generated by DMXAA, we used a tumor
system with a well-characterized tumor antigen. EG7 thymoma
cells express the chicken ovalbumin neotumor antigen (7) and
grow well in the flanks of C57/B6 mice. The dominant MHC class I

peptide (SIINFEKL) has been well characterized, and tetramers are
available to specifically track antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
To determine if DMXAA was effective in this tumor model, mice
bearing large tumors (300–400 mm3) were injected with 18 mg/kg
DMXAA via the i.p. route. Similar to our previous studies with
mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines (6), this dose of DMXAA
(a) induced substantial tumor necrosis in the center of the tumors
(Fig. 1A versus B); (b) markedly up-regulated a number of tumor
cytokine/chemokine proteins such as MCP-1, TNFa, RANTES,
MIP1a, KC, IL-6, and IP-10 (Table 1); and (c) was effective in
reducing tumor size with a number of cures (Fig. 1D and F).
DMXAA stimulates a CD8+-dependent antitumor immune
response. To confirm the role of lymphocytes, C57/B6 or SCID
mice were injected s.c. with 1  106 tumor cells and were later
injected i.p. with DMXAA when tumors reached 300 mm3. Tumor
growth was followed and measured twice a week. In the SCID
animals (Fig. 1E), there was an initial reduction in tumor size, but a

(C ) induced hemorrhagic necrosis and microscopic tumor cell death in the center of the tumors. Effects on tumor growth: D, C57/B6 mice were injected s.c. in the

NOTE: Flank EG7 tumors were established by s.c. injection in mice. The mice were treated with 18 mg/kg DMXAA i.p. when the tumor size was f300
mm3. To assess cytokine/chemokine levels, tumors (n = 3) were harvested 24 h after i.p. injection of DMXAA and homogenized, and cytokine levels were

rapid regrowth as opposed to the much stronger and prolonged
antitumor effect in the C57/B6 mice (Fig. 1F). This is consistent
with the biphasic effects of DMXAA seen previously (ref. 6; see
Introduction).
Using the EG7 system, we could more carefully characterize this
immune response. Five days following DMXAA injection, the
spleens and TDLN from animals were isolated and subjected to
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to identify CD8+
T cells reactive with the ovalbumin-specific peptide tetramer.
Although DMXAA did not increase the number of CD8+ T cells in
TDLNs (Fig. 2A), it did significantly (P < 0.01) increase the number
of SIINFEKL-tetramer–positive CD8+ T cells by more than 4-fold
(Fig. 2B). After DMXAA treatment, the percentage of CD8+ T
cells in the spleens of tumor-bearing animals significantly
increased (P < 0.01) from 15% to 24% (Fig. 2C). More importantly,
the percentage of splenic CD8+ T cells that were tetramer positive

went from 0.6% to 3.9% (P < 0.01; Fig. 2D). These data show that
DMXAA treatment was highly effective in generating antigenspecific antitumor CD8+ T cells.
DMXAA activates TDLN DCs in vivo. Given this impressive
CD8+ T cell response, we postulated that DMXAA was rapidly
activating DCs within the TDLNs. Accordingly, 1 day after i.p.
administration of DMXAA or saline into tumor-bearing mice, we
dissected out TDLNs, combined the nodes from three animals
and subjected the cells to multiparameter FACS. DCs were identified by CD11c+ staining. There were no differences in the size
of the lymph nodes or the percentage of CD11c+ cells within the
lymph nodes of DMXAA-treated or control-treated animals.
However, as shown in Fig. 3, the DC in the mice treated with
DMXAA had a marked up-regulation of the costimulatory molecule
CD86 (mean fluorescent intensity of 96.7 versus 330; Fig. 3A).
ICAM-1 (mean fluorescent intensity of 61 versus 123; Fig. 3B) and

treatment increases the number of antigen
specific CD8+ T cells in lymph node and
spleen. Tumor-bearing mice were treated
with DMXAA (18 mg/kg) i.p., CA4P
(200 mg/kg), or saline control. Five days
after treatment, TDLNs and spleens (n = 3)
were harvested from naı̈ve, control, and
CA4P- and DMXAA-treated mice. Single
cell suspensions were subjected to
flow-cytometric analysis. Lymphocytes
were identified by CD45 staining, and
the percentage of CD8+ T cells was
determined for lymph nodes (A ) or spleen
(C ). Antigen-specific cells were identified
using SIINFEKL-specific tetramers after
gating on CD8+ T cells and expressed as
the percentage of CD8+ T cells in lymph
nodes (B) or spleen (D ). *, P < 0.05

DMXAA Activates Dendritic Cells

Figure 3. DMXAA (but not CA4P) activates DCs in draining lymph node.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with DMXAA (18 mg/kg) i.p., CA4P
(200 mg/kg) or saline control. Twenty-four hours after treatment, draining lymph
nodes (n = 3) were isolated, harvested, and pooled for FACS analysis. DC cells
were distinguished by their CD45- and CD11c-positive staining. MFI, mean
fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units. A, histograms for CD86 expression.
B, histograms for ICAM-1. C, histograms for CD80 expression. All three
molecules were up-regulated in DC from draining lymph nodes in DMXAAtreated animals compared with control or animals treated with CA4P.

CD80 (mean fluorescent intensity of 39.5 versus 61; Fig. 3C) were
also up-regulated, indicating DC maturation/activation. The
experiment was repeated, however, this time also examining the
nondraining lymph node. As shown in Table 2A, FACS showed
similar increases in the expression levels of CD86, CD80, and
ICAM-1 on the DCs from the TDLNs and non-TDLNs. We did not
see increases in CD40 at this 24-h time point.
We also did FACS to determine if DMXAA affected the numbers
of plasmacytoid DCs in the TDLNs. Using a definition of pDCs as
the CD11c+/GR-1+/B220+ cell population (11), we found similar
levels of pDCs in control (9.4%) and DMXAA-treated (14%) animals.
Tumor necrosis is not sufficient for DC activation. One
mechanism by which DMXAA might be activating DCs could be by

www.aacrjournals.org

inducing danger signals released by tumor necrosis (10). To test
this hypothesis, we took advantage of the availability of a second
vascular disrupting agent (CA4P; refs. 12, 13). CA4P works through
an entirely different mechanism that involves direct endothelial cell
toxicity (via microtubular inhibition) rather than cytokine release.
We have confirmed this difference by doing real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) on combretastatin-treated tumors and
observed only minimal up-regulation of cytokine/chemokine
messages (data not shown), quite unlike the robust response after
DMXAA (see Table 1 and ref. 6). However, treatment of tumorbearing mice with 200 mg/kg of CA4P led to marked necrosis in
EG7 tumors (Fig. 1C). The degree of tumor necrosis was quantified
using image analysis in multiple tumors. Tumors from untreated
animals had 22 F 11% of tumor area with necrosis. Tumors from
DMXAA-treated tumors had 63 F 30% of tumor area with necrosis.
Tumors from CA4P-treated animals had 76 F 3% of tumor area
with necrosis. The values from CA4P and DMXAA tumors were
statistically larger than control (P < 0.05), but not different from
each other.
Using CA4P as a necrosis control, we compared DC activation in
TDLNs after saline, CA4P, and DMXAA. As shown in Fig. 3 and
Table 2A, CA4P did not increase CD86, ICAM-1, or CD80 expression
on DC in the TDLNs or non-TDLNs. In contrast to DMXAA, CA4P
did not increase the percentage of tetramer-positive cells in the
spleen (Fig. 2D). Thus, tumor necrosis alone is not sufficient for DC
activation. Consistent with the importance of immune activation,
tumors treated with CA4P showed only a short growth delay
(probably due to the initial central necrosis) with rapid regrowth,
whereas the animals treated with DMXAA showed marked tumor
regression with 3/5 animals being cured (Fig. 1D).
DMXAA can directly activate DC. To study the mechanism by
which DMXAA activated DCs, we switched to an in vitro model.
We have previously shown that tumor-associated macrophages can
be activated to secrete cytokines in vitro after exposure to DMXAA
(6). Similar studies were conducted using mouse bone marrow–
derived DCs (BMDC). In our first set of experiments, BMDC were
cultured with LPS and CpG DNA (as positive controls) and varying
concentrations of DMXAA (1–90 Ag /mL). Supernatants collected
from the cultures showed clear dose-responsive increases in IL-6
and IL-12 production after DMXAA treatment (Fig. 4A). FACS of
the CD11c+ cells showed up-regulation of the costimulatory
molecule CD86 upon treatment with DMXXA in a dose-responsive
manner (Fig. 4B). DMXAA was thus capable of activating DCs
in vitro.
To determine if DMXAA was activating DCs directly or indirectly
via potentially contaminating mononuclear cells, we repeated these
experiments using an enriched DC preparation. With the use of
magnetic cell separation, CD11c-expressing cells were positively
selected and consistently enriched to purity at least >93%. DMXAAinduced purified DCs to produce IL-6 and IL-12 (Fig. 4C) and upregulate CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 4D). To determine if these effects
were due to the possible contamination of DMXAA with LPS,
experiments were repeated in the presence of the LPS-binding
antibiotic polymyxin B. Polymyxin B blocked LPS-mediated
production of IL-12 and DC activation as measured by CD86
expression, but had no effect on DMXAA-mediated activity (data
not shown).
We also studied the effect of DMXAA on DC at the RNA level
(Table 2B). Purified DC were treated as above, but harvested at
1 and 6 h for RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time
RT-PCR. LPS, CpG, and DMXAA all caused rapid, and in some

NOTE: (A) Tumor-bearing animals were treated with saline (control), DMXAA, or combretastatin (n = 3 for each group). Twenty-four hours later, the
TDLN and non-TDLNs were isolated, combined, processed, and subjected to FACS. The expression levels of activation markers on the CD11c+ cells
are expressed as the mean fluorescence intensity. The experiment was repeated once with similar results. (B) Cultured DCs were exposed to saline,
LPS (100 ng/mL), CpG (0.5 Amol/L), or DMXAA (150 Ag/mL), mRNA extracted, cDNA prepared, and subjected to real-time RT-PCR. Samples were
normalized for h-actin expression, and each sample was compared with saline controls. The mean fold increase in message level ( from quadruplicate
samples) is tabulated along with the SE.

cases, very large increases in IL-6 and IL-12 mRNA levels. Clear
changes were also seen in message levels for CD86, CD40, and
ICAM-1. Interestingly, similar to the FACS data, the induction of
the costimulatory molecules was much more sensitive to DMXAA
than the induction of cytokines when compared with LPS and CpG.
These data indicate that DMXAA can directly activate DC to
produce costimulatory molecules and cytokines.
Activation of DC by DMXAA is MyD88 independent. Although
it has been established that DMXAA activates macrophages
through a pathway dependent on the transcription factor nuclear
factor nB (NFnB; ref. 14–16), other upstream signals involved in
this pathway remain unknown. DCs use germ line–encoded
sensors that recognize specific danger signals, which include TLRs
(17, 18). Upon stimulation, all TLRs (except TLR3) use the
intracellular adaptor molecule MyD88 for signaling. To determine
if DMXAA activation of DCs required MyD88, we examined the
effect of DMXAA on BMDC derived from MyD88 / mice. As
shown in Fig. 4E, whereas IL-12 production induced by CpG was
completely inhibited in the DC from MyD88 / mice, the effects of
DMXAA on mouse DC IL-12 production was independent of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

MyD88. Similarly, DMXAA activation of CD86 expression was also
independent of MyD88 (Fig. 4F). In similar experiments using
BMDC derived from Tlr3 / mice, we found the effects of DMXAA
on DC to be independent of TLR3 expression (data not shown).
These experiments indicate that activation of DC with DMXAA
occurs independently of the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 and
suggests that DMXAA does not activate DCs via TLRs.

Discussion
Although a range of immunotherapies have been successful in
preventing the growth of tumors (prophylactic therapy) or in
treating early or small tumors, immunotherapy has generally been
quite ineffective in treating large, established tumors in animal
models or in clinical trials (19–21). This can likely be explained by
the extensive requirements for a successful adaptive antitumor
immune response, which include (a) release of relatively specific
tumor-derived antigens, (b) uptake of these antigens by tumorinfiltrating DCs, (c) activation of these DCs with migration to
draining lymph nodes, (d) presentation of tumor antigen by the DC

to lymphocytes, (e) generation and expansion of CTLs (primarily
CD8+ T cells), ( f ) trafficking of the CTL to the tumor, and (g ) CTLmediated destruction of tumors (by either direct killing or by
activation of other cytotoxic cells, like macrophages) (22–24).
Although each of these steps occur successfully in response to
most infectious insults, the ability of the immune system to
eliminate tumors is not nearly as effective. This difficulty in
generating a successful antitumor response is clearly illustrated

in the experimental EG7 thymoma model used here, where the
tumor cells express a very immunostimulatory foreign antigen
(chicken ovalbumin), yet are still able to grow easily in an
immunocompetent mouse (25). This failure to recognize and reject
cells expressing this antigen is likely due to numerous immunosuppressive barriers generated by the tumors, including generation
of suppressor cells (such as myeloid suppressor cells, M2 macrophages, T-regulatory cells), the presence of inactivating cytokines

(i.e., transforming growth factor-h and IL-10), as well as other
T-cell–suppressive substances, such as prostaglandin E2 or arginase
(26–28).
Because of these multiple barriers, it has become increasingly
clear that successful immunotherapy must attack as many of these
obstacles as possible (23). The small flavonoid compound DMXAA
is especially attractive as an antitumor agent in this regard because
it has the ability to target multiple points in the immunotherapeutic cascade by inducing tumor cell death (antigen release), as
well as altering the tumor microenvironment to become more
immunostimulatory (1, 2). Specifically, in previous work (6), we
showed that DMXAA was able to induce tumor regression by
activating tumor-associated macrophages resulting in the secretion
of immunostimulatory cytokines that led to (a) vascular activation,
tumor vessel occlusion, and ischemic necrosis; (b) initial recruitment of mononuclear cells; and (c) subsequent recruitment of
CD8+ T cells. This immune mechanism is consistent with experiments using the related flavanoid acetic acid (FAA) showing that
mice treated with FAA + IL-2 were immune to rechallenge (29).
The purpose of this study was to more completely dissect the
immunologic mechanisms by which DMXAA exerted its effects by
using a model with a well-characterized tumor antigen (EG7 cells).
We were first able to show that DMXAA induced central tumor
necrosis and strong antitumor activity in EG7 tumors (Fig. 1B).
The antitumor effect of DMXAA was lymphocyte-dependent in
EG7 tumors (Fig. 1E), as it was in a variety of other tumors (6).
With the availability of peptide-specific tetramers, we now clearly
show that DMXAA markedly increases the number of antigenspecific T cells in both TDLN and in the spleen 5 days after therapy
(Fig. 2).
We had originally assumed that the ability of DMXAA to induce a
CTL response was due to DC activation induced by the
combination of tumor cell necrosis plus the production of effective
danger signals (such as necrotic cell debris and cytokines, including
MCP-1, TNF, MIP1a, IFNg, and IL-12). Our animal model
confirmed the presence of such activated DCs (evidenced by upregulation of CD86, CD80, and ICAM-1) 24 h after DMXAA
treatment within the TDLNs (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we also saw upregulation of these activation markers on DC in the non-TDLNs
(Table 2A) suggesting a systemic effect. By using the drug CA4P, we
were able to confirm that induction of widespread tumor necrosis
via ischemia/reperfusion is not sufficient to activate DC, induce
antigen-specific T cells, or induce a therapeutically effective
immunologic response. CA4P is a true vascular disrupting agent
that targets the microtubules of tumor-associated endothelium
leading to a vascular collapse within the tumor and subsequent
necrosis (Fig. 1C; refs. 12, 13), but does not activate tumorassociated macrophages and does not induce cytokine release
within the tumor (data not shown). Although the amount of tumor
necrosis induced by CA4P was equal to or greater than that of
DMXAA (Fig. 1), CA4P did not up-regulate DC activation markers
(Fig. 3 and Table 2) and did not induce tetramer-positive cells
(Fig. 2). Consistent with this lack of immune activation, CA4P only
transiently slowed tumor growth, in contrast to the marked
reduction in size after treatment with DMXAA (Fig. 1D).
Our most important new observation from these studies was the
unexpected finding that DMXAA can also directly activate DCs.
Although DMXAA and its parent compound, flavone 8-acetic acid
(FAA), have been shown to activate NFnB in tumor-associated
macrophages and natural killer cells (14–16, 29, 30), to our
knowledge, there has been no published data showing these

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (14). July 15, 2007

compounds could affect DC. When we studied purified bone
marrow–derived DCs in vitro, we found that DMXAA had the
ability to induce DC to up-regulate the mRNA expression and
protein levels of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-12) and costimulatory
molecules, such as CD86, CD80, and ICAM-1 (Fig. 4). We suggest
that the combination of direct activation of DC in an environment
that contains large amounts of necrotic tumor debris (potential
tumor antigens) and a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Table 1) likely explains the ability of DMXAA to induce
such efficient antitumor immune responses capable of curing even
large, established tumors.
The signals that can activate DC to effectively present tumor
antigens has been an area of active interest (10, 17, 31, 32). There
are several distinct mechanisms leading to DC activation (17, 33).
One group of activators include non–self-pathogen–associated
molecules such as LPS, flagellin, and unmethylated DNA rich in CG
motifs (CpG DNA) that are recognized by germ line–encoded
pattern-recognition receptors (18). The best studied of these are
the TLRs. TLRs act as sensors that, when stimulated, result in the
rapid signaling of proinflammatory and costimulatory pathways
(34). An increasing number of endogenous signals released from
dying cells that also signal danger to DC are being recognized, including uric acid crystals, heat shock proteins, extracellular matrix
components, guanine derivatives, and self DNA (10, 33, 35, 36).
Some, but not all, of these endogenous stimulators are also
recognized by TLRs.
It is currently unclear how DMXAA activates DC. Although it has
been shown that DMXAA can activate NFnB in a number of cell
types, despite more than 15 years of research on DMXAA and FAA,
no DMXAA receptor has been identified, and the molecular
mechanisms responsible for this activation remain unknown
(2, 14–16). As discussed above, one obvious set of candidate
receptors in DC are the TLRs, of which there are now more than 10
recognized members. For example, the immunostimulatory activity
of small organic molecules like guanine nucleoside analogues are
mediated through TLR-7 (35). As a way to study this question, we
exposed DC derived from mice lacking the adapter protein MyD88
to DMXAA. All TLRs, except TLR3, have been shown to use the
MyD88-dependent pathway, which leads to NFnB activation and
proinflammatory cytokine production (34). Whereas signaling from
our positive control (CpG DNA using TLR9) was completely
abolished, DMXAA-induced IL-12 production and CD86 and CD40
up-regulation were independent of MyD88 (Fig. 4E and F). We also
found the effects of DMXAA on DC to be independent of TLR3
expression. Thus, although we do not know whether DMXAA binds
to a surface receptor on DC and initiates a signaling cascade or
whether it diffuses into the cell and interacts directly with a
cytoplasmic signaling molecule, such as a member of the NOD
(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) protein family (37),
we provide strong evidence that TLRs are not involved in this
process. This idea is supported by (a) the different kinetics of
mRNA expression seen after DMXAA compared with LPS and CpG,
(b) the observation that costimulatory molecules (versus cytokines)
are more affected by DMXAA than by LPS and CpG (Table 2), and
(c) preliminary data looking at the interaction of DMXAA and TLRdependent activation showing additive effects (data not shown).
We also have data to suggest that DMXAA-induced macrophage
activation is also MyD88 independent (38). Further work will be
required to understand the mechanism by which DMXAA activates
DC. Determining exactly where and how DMXAA interacts with the
NFnB signaling pathway is an area of ongoing investigation.

DMXAA Activates Dendritic Cells

There are a number of implications (and further questions)
raised by this study. First, these studies add further support to the
idea that DMXAA may be useful when combined with other types
of immunotherapy such as vaccines or adoptive transfer. For
example, Kanwar et al. (39) found that DMXAA combined with
B7.1 (CD80)–mediated immunotherapy overcomes immune resistance and leads to the eradication of large tumors and multiple
tumor foci. We have some preliminary data to support this
hypothesis in vaccine trials and in adoptive transfer studies using
transgenic OT-1 T cells (that have a transgenic T-cell receptor
recognizing the OVA peptide SIINFEKL) in combination with
DMXAA to treat EG7 tumors. Second, our observations suggest
that DMXAA may be similar to an endogenous or microbial
counterpart that may define a new pathway in innate immunity.
Third, although DMXAA is currently in clinical trials (3–5),
published work (14, 40) and our own studies suggest that its
activating effects are much stronger in murine leukocytes than

human cells. By better understanding how DMXAA is interacting
with mouse signaling cascades, we may be able to optimize
effects in human systems (see ref. 41).
In summary, we have shown that systemic administration of the
flavanoid molecule DMXAA effectively induces strong and antigenspecific antitumor CTL responses by interacting with both the
innate and acquired immune system at multiple levels. An
important new finding in this paper is that DMXAA can be added
to the list of agents that have the ability to directly activate DCs.
