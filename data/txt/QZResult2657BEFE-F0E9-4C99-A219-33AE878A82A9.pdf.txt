ABSTRACT
“The dose makes the poison”, the common motto of toxicology first expressed
by Paracelsus more than 400 years ago, may effectively serve to guide potential
applications for metformin and related biguanides in oncology. While Paracelsus’
law for the dose-response effect has been commonly exploited for the use of some
anti-cancer drugs at lower doses in non-neoplastic diseases (e.g., methotrexate),
the opposite scenario also holds true; in other words, higher doses of non-oncology
drugs, such as anti-diabetic biguanides, might exert direct anti-neoplastic effects.
Here, we propose that, as for any drug, there is a dose range for biguanides that is
without any effect, one corresponding to “diabetobiguanides” with a pharmacological
effect (e.g., insulin sensitization in type 2 diabetes, prevention of insulin-dependent
carcinogenesis, indirect inhibition of insulin and growth factor-dependent cancer
growth) but with minimal toxicity and another corresponding to “oncobiguanides”
with pharmacological (i.e., direct and strong anticancer activity against cancer
cells) as well as toxic effects. Considering that biguanides demonstrate a better
safety profile than most oncology drugs in current use, we should contemplate the
possibility of administering biguanides through non-conventional routes (e.g., inhaled
for carcinomas of the lung, topical for skin cancers, intravenous as an adjunctive
therapy, rectal suppositories for rectal cancer) to unambiguously investigate the
therapeutic value of high-dose transient biguanide exposure in cancer. Perhaps then,
the oncobiguanides, as we call them here, could be viewed as a mechanistically
different type of anti-cancer drugs employed at doses notably higher than those used
chronically when functioning as diabetobiguanides.

The antimetabolite drug methotrexate (MTX) was
originally developed as an anti-cancer agent and, as such,
received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval in 1953. Not long afterwards, MTX was found
to exert symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant,
disabling psoriasis; the FDA officially approved MTX as a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment for psoriasis in the early 1970’s. Today, MTX is
a well-known chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive
agent that is widely and successfully used in many
rheumatologic, dermatologic, and hematologic diseases
[1]. Notably, the clinical use of MTX represents a
paradigmatic example of Paracelsus’ law, which states
2344

Oncotarget

“sola dosis facit venenum (only dose makes the poison)”,
meaning that the right dose differentiates a poison from
a remedy; hence, a molecule becomes a drug if the dose
required to treat a complication is pharmacologically
active with minimal toxicity. The so-called Paracelsus’
“dose-response effect” establishes that, for any drug,
there is a dose range (concentration) that is without any
effect, one with a pharmacological effect but minimal
toxicity (or an acceptable safety profile), and another with
pharmacological and toxic effects. In the case of MTX,
experience in multiple sclerosis indicates that the low dose
of 7.5 mg per square meter (m2) per week (0.1 mg kg1
) for up to 2 years is not associated with toxicity. The
use of doses of MTX up to 30 mg per week (0.4 mg kg-1)
in the treatment of juvenile and rheumatoid arthritis and
psoriasis is associated with an acceptable toxicity profile.
Drastically higher doses of MTX, up to 5,000-12,000 mg
per m2 (130-300 mg kg-1) for several weeks, a dosage that
can yield serum concentrations of >1,000 µmol/L (i.e.,
within the range of concentrations associated with lifethreatening MTX toxicity), are used for the treatment of
cancer. MTX is therefore used as an “onco drug” at doses
up to 1,000-fold higher than those employed chronically
for separate indications in immune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.
During the early 1970’s with the cancer-to-psoriasis
drug repositioning of MTX, Canada approved the use
of metformin, a member of the biguanide class of drugs
that also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and
buformin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin
is now one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide; in
2010, there were more than 100 million prescriptions
worldwide for metformin, alone and in combination.
Starting in 2005 with a report by Evans et al. entitled
“Metformin and reduced risk of cancer in diabetic
patients” [2], numerous epidemiological and casecontrolled studies have repeatedly suggested that the use
of metformin in diabetic patients appears to be associated
with a significantly lower risk of cancer mortality
and incidence in comparison to other anti-diabetic
medications. Since then, the hypothesis that metformin
may have clinically relevant preventive and treatment
effects against human cancers has exploded as an evergrowing research field, as scientists have discovered
metformin’s multi-faceted anti-cancer mechanisms
linked to malignization and even to so-called cancer stem
cells (CSCs) [3-6]. Thus, the molecular and pre-clinical
breakthroughs in “anti-cancer metformin” have taken
place in the past decade, and many phase II and II clinical
trials of metformin are now in progress (as of February
2014, the clinicaltrials.gov database lists more than 60)
to examine the effects of metformin on various cancer
endpoints.
Although the present, metformin-based clinical
investigations aim to test the relevant hypothesis that a
practical, long-term administration of conventional antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

diabetic doses of this biguanide may have significant
anticancer activity, most of metformin’s antineoplastic
mechanisms of action that appear to operate in preclinical
models [3-6] will remain obscured in these trials, as
drug exposure in target cancer tissues may be clearly
suboptimal. In the cancer prevention scenario, where
side effects are less acceptable than they are in the
area of cancer treatment, we might only consider the
hypothesis that the conventional dose for the treatment of
diabetes, or even lower doses, will be clinically useful.
In the cancer treatment scenario, however, the assumption
that the antineoplastic effects of metformin are solely
attributable to its indirect, endocrine-like effects, such as
its insulin-lowering effects, which are generally proposed
to slow tumor growth in hyperinsulinemic patients with
insulin-addicted cancers, could only explain the currently
adopted long-term treatment with diabetic doses for
maximal benefit in cancer patients. Conversely, if we
assume the real possibility that the antitumoral activity
of metformin can be attributed to its many direct actions
on target cancer cells as shown in vitro, we should then
consider that, in certain contexts, short-term exposure
to higher doses of biguanides could have clinical use
in oncology. Thus, in addition to the fact that particular
tissues known to accumulate relatively high metformin
levels following conventional oral dosing (e.g., liver,
gastrointestinal tract) may provide proof-of-concept
clinical models for investigation of the occurrence and
relevance of metformin’s direct mechanisms of action
(e.g., reduction of hepatoma risk, prevention of familial or
sporadic intestinal polyposis) [7], we should contemplate
the utility of other unconventional routes of short-term
high-dose metformin exposure alone and in combination
regimens. As for the above-mentioned case of MTX, we
here propose that “oncobiguanides” should be viewed as
a different type of anti-cancer drugs when employed at
doses notably higher than those used chronically when
operating as “diabetobiguanides”.
The notion that conventional phase I and II trials
must explore the possibility of exposing tumors to the
higher biguanide concentrations used in many preclinical
models is certainly supported by the strong anti-cancer
efficacy of the intraperitoneal high-dose exposure to
metformin observed in PI3K-mutated, insulin-independent
human cancer xenotumors, in which the anti-cancer
effects of metformin necessarily involve mechanisms
distinct from those that might operate with the doses used
in the clinical management of type 2 diabetes [8]. In our
hands, ad libitum access to water containing oral 250 mg
kg-1 metformin beginning 1 week prior to inoculation
of MCF10DCIS.com breast cancer cells harboring
the insulin-unresponsive PIK3CA-activating mutation
H1047R modestly affected the growth of the xenotumors,
reaching a maximum of 43% at 4 weeks after cell
inoculation and decreasing toward the end of the treatment
(approximately 30-35%). Moreover, oral metformin did
2345

not affect tumor incidence, the proliferation factor mitotic
activity index (MAI), or the anatomopathological features
of MCF10DCIS.com cancer tissues. To determine if oral
metformin produced plasmatic levels of metformin that
could be comparable to those achieved in humans, we
recently assessed plasma concentrations of metformin
at the end of the 8-week treatment using HPLC coupled
to ESI-QTOF-MS. Mice that were treated with an oral
dosing schedule achieved a concentration of 4.7 ± 1.3
µmol/L (~0.6 µg/mL) metformin, which is consistent with
the steady-state values that have been reported in diabetic
patients at the usual clinical doses and schedules. We then
measured the circulating insulin level following exposure
to oral metformin (even though this is not a diabetic
model) and found that oral metformin significantly

decreased insulin levels by ~35%. Although it could be
hypothesized that a modest but prolonged suppression of
insulin signaling by oral metformin at conventional, antidiabetic doses can be sufficient to inhibit the growth of
breast xenotumors, a role for insulin can be eliminated in
PIK3CA H1047R-mutated MC10DCIS.com cells, which
have been shown to proliferate regardless of the presence
or absence of insulin in vitro and to form tumors that are
refractory to dietary restriction (DR) in vivo. Therefore,
the metformin-induced inhibition of additional signaling
pathways, e.g., the liver-derived production of circulating
growth factors that ultimately activate local oncogenic
signaling in cancer tissues [9] as well as bioenergetic and
anabolic machinery in cancer cells, may be involved.
We hypothesized that a different route of

there is a dose range for biguanides that is without any anti-cancer effect, one corresponding to “diabetobiguanides” with a pharmacological
effect (e.g., insulin sensitization in type 2 diabetes, prevention of insulin-dependent carcinogenesis, indirect inhibition of insulin- and
growth factor-dependent cancer growth) but with minimal toxicity and another corresponding to “oncobiguanides” with pharmacological
(i.e., direct and strong activity against cancer cells including CSCs) as well as toxic effects. Bottom panel. Because biguanides demonstrate
a better safety profile than most oncology drugs in current use, we should contemplate the possibility of administering biguanides through
non-conventional routes (e.g., inhaled for carcinomas of the lung, topical for skin cancers, intravenous combination chemotherapy, rectal
suppositories for rectal cancer) to unambiguously investigate the therapeutic value of high-dose transient biguanide exposure in cancer. The

administration of metformin, such as intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection, could be more effective because the peak plasma
concentrations would be higher than those that could be
achieved with oral metformin. Accordingly, insulinindependent, DR-refractory MCF10DCIS.com xenotumors
were exquisitely sensitive to the daily, i.p. administration
of 200 mg kg-1 metformin beginning 1 week before the
inoculation of cancer cells. The anti-cancer activity of
daily i.p. metformin increased in a time-dependent manner
and reached a highly significant >80% inhibition of tumor
growth by the end of the 8-week treatment. Moreover,
treatment with metformin using the i.p. administration
route significantly reduced the proliferation factor MAI
by ~50% and notably decreased the tumor cellularity in
MCF10DCIS.com cancer tissues [8]. Notably, HPLCESI-QTOF-MS pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the
plasma levels of metformin immediately after the last i.p.
injection were ~150-fold higher than those obtained with
the oral dosing schedule. Thus, mice that were treated
with the i.p. dosing schedule achieved 679 ± 16 µmol/L
(~87 µg/mL) metformin, a circulating dose of metformin
that is within the lower limit observed in an individual
with metformin poisoning but that was surprisingly well
tolerated and did not significantly affect either the general
health or the weight of the mice throughout the course of
the study. Strikingly, the highly efficacious and extremely
high circulating concentrations of metformin achieved
following i.p. administration failed to decrease insulin
levels to the extent observed with the oral metformindosing schedule.
Blood or plasma concentrations of metformin are
typically in the range of 7.8-31.2 µmol/L (1-4 µg/mL)
in diabetic persons receiving the drug therapeutically;
indeed, during controlled clinical trials, the maximum
plasma levels did not generally exceed 39 µmol/L
(5 µg/mL) metformin, even at maximum doses.
Circulating concentrations of 312-836 µmol/L (40-120
µg/mL) can be detected in victims of acute metformin
overdose, and concentrations of 624-1,560 µmol/L
(80-200 µg/L) are seen in metformin fatalities. Yet, the
“unsafe” concentration of metformin is not precisely
known. Moreover, the actual relevance of measuring
the circulating levels of metformin in predicting the
risk of lactic acidosis remains unclear. Additionally,
although there is uncertainty concerning the feasibility of
administering biguanides through non-conventional routes
to investigate the therapeutic value of high-dose transient
exposure, we should acknowledge that biguanides have a
better safety profile than most oncology drugs in current
use [7]. Perhaps it is time to consider that, as with any
drug, there is a metformin dose range that is without any
effect, one corresponding to “diabetobiguanides” with a
pharmacological effect (e.g., insulin sensitization in type 2
diabetes, prevention of insulin-dependent carcinogenesis,
indirect inhibition of insulin- and growth factor-dependent
cancer growth) but with minimal toxicity and another
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

corresponding to “oncobiguanides” with pharmacological
(i.e., direct and strong anti-cancer activity) as well as toxic
effects (Fig. 1, top).
As stated by Paracelsus more than 400 years ago,
it is “the dose that makes a drug”; this principle has been
exploited for the use of some anti-cancer drugs at lower
doses in several non-neoplastic diseases. As the opposite
scenario also holds true, i.e., higher doses of non-oncology
drugs (such as the anti-diabetic biguanides) exerting antineoplastic effects, the exploitation of available biguanides
(metformin, phenformin, buformin) or libraries of novel
biguanides using nonconventional routes of administration
(e.g., inhaled, topical, parental, rectal, etc) to achieve
short-term high-dose exposure in cancer tissues (Fig.
1, bottom) could represent a cost-effective and efficient
channel to optimize pharmacokinetics and develop
rational combinations in a forthcoming second-generation
of biguanide-based trials in oncology. While endless
pharmacovigilance has monitored the safety profile of
the diabetobiguanide metformin, its natural ancestor,
guanidine-rich Galega officinalis (known as “ProfessorWeed” in the USA), is a Class A Federal Noxious Weed in
35 states of the United States and appears on the database
of poisonous plants [10], ironically recapitulating the
dose-response effect of metformin in humans, as per
Paracelsus’ law.
