ABSTRACT
Inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK signaling is beneficial for many patients with
BRAFV600E–mutated melanoma. However, primary and secondary resistances restrict
long-lasting therapy success. Combination therapies are therefore urgently needed.
Here, we evaluate the cellular effect of combining a MEK inhibitor with a genotoxic
apoptosis inducer. Strikingly, we observed that an activated MAPK pathway promotes
in several melanoma cell lines the pro-apoptotic response to genotoxic stress,
and MEK inhibition reduces intrinsic apoptosis. This goes along with MEK inhibitor
induced increased RAS and P-AKT levels. The protective effect of the MEK inhibitor
depends on PI3K signaling, which prevents the induction of pro-apoptotic PUMA
that mediates apoptosis after DNA damage. We could show that the MEK inhibitor
dependent feedback loop is enabled by several factors, including EGF receptor and
members of the SPRED family. The simultaneous knockdown of SPRED1 and SPRED2
mimicked the effects of MEK inhibitor such as PUMA repression and protection from
apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that MEK inhibition of BRAFV600E-positive melanoma
cells can protect from genotoxic stress, thereby achieving the opposite of the intended
anti-tumorigenic effect of the combination of MEK inhibitor with inducers of intrinsic
apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

pathway is a commonly observed resistance phenomenon
which is mediated by acquired mutations in ERK1/2
upstream components such as NRAS, MEK or BRAF
itself [5-7] or by overexpression of MEK effectors such as
COT and several receptor tyrosine kinases [5, 8-10]. Direct
inhibition of MEK circumvents this problem, as it directly
prevents ERK1/2 activation, and thus the application
of MEK1/2 inhibitors such as selumetinib (AZD6244)
and trametinib (GSK1120212) is pursued for melanoma
treatment as well [11, 12]. Indeed, patients preselected for
the BRAFV600E mutation showed an improved response
to selumetinib or trametinib when compared to standard
chemotherapy [11, 12]. The combination of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors constitutes an additional clinical strategy
and leads to a better progression free survival than BRAF
inhibitor monotherapy. Still, the development of resistant
tumors as well as a significant group of non-responders
remains a pressing problem [13]. It is generally believed
that the strong activation of the MAPK pathway which
is observed in most melanomas mediates a strong antiapoptotic response and limits the efficiency of DNA

Melanoma constitutes a very heterogenous cancer
type which stands out by its high plasticity. However,
a common feature of most melanomas is the activation
of the MAPK pathway, which is found in more than
80% of melanomas. In many cases, this is attributed to
the expression of oncogenic BRAF which is located
directly upstream of MEK. Consequently, the MAPK
pathway emerged as a promising therapeutic target. In
patients carrying the oncogenic BRAF variant BRAFV600E,
treatment with the second generation BRAF inhibitors
vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436)
have led to significant improvement of progressionfree and overall survival and thus constitute the most
successful treatment strategies since decades [1-3].
Highly increased target protein specificity as well as a
strong potency to inhibit MAPK signaling are responsible
for this success [4]. However, despite the striking results
that were achieved, emerging inhibitor resistance leads to
high relapse rates. Secondary reactivation of the MAPK

damaging agents [14]. As a consequence, combinations of
MAPK pathway inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents or
other pathway inhibitors arise as rationale and are already
tested in clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov).
Here we describe the effect of the combination
of a MEK inhibitor and, representative for a genotoxic
apoptosis inducer, the DNA damaging agent cisplatin in
a panel of melanoma cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found
that MEK inhibition leads to the protection from cisplatininduced apoptosis in some cell lines. This was caused by
a MEK-inhibitor induced activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway, resulting in transcriptional repression of the proapoptotic gene BBC3, encoding PUMA. Mechanistically,
MEK inhibition relieved several negative feedback loops
which include SPRY and SPRED proteins and resulted in
enhanced RAS signaling. Receptor tyrosine kinases were
involved in this mechanism.

Our data demonstrate for the first time that MAPK
pathway inhibition of BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma can
not only lack an efficient pro-apoptotic effect, but even
allows a better survival in presence of a classical inducer
of intrinsic apoptosis. As a consequence, MAPK pathway
inhibition can even worsen the outcome of melanoma
treatment under certain conditions.

RESULTS
MEK inhibition can protect melanoma cells from
genotoxic apoptosis
Most melanoma cell lines are susceptible to
inhibition of BRAF or MEK. Accordingly, MEK

inhibition led to apoptosis and growth reduction in
all cell lines from our melanoma cell panel (Figure
S1A-C). However, intrinsic or acquired resistance is a
major problem in the clinic, thus providing a reason to
combine MEK inhibitors with other anticancer drugs such
as chemotherapeutic agents. We therefore investigated
whether the anti-tumorigenic effect of MEK inhibition
could be enhanced by combination with an apoptosis
inducer. Chemotherapeutic agents including platinum
compounds are applied in combination therapies in
clinical trials for cutaneous and uveal melanomas (www.
clinicaltrials.gov). As cisplatin is a well-described
DNA damaging compound which activates the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway, we used it as representative genotoxic
apoptosis inducer. We tested the effect of combining the
non-competitive MEK inhibitor PD184352 (in short: PD)

with cisplatin in five BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma cell
lines. PD inhibits MAPK activity with IC50 values ranging
from 100 to 500 nM [15], and we chose a concentration
of 2 µM of the inhibitor to efficiently block MAPK
signaling (Figure S1A). In all cell lines, cisplatin alone
led to a strong reduction of cell number after two days
of treatment compared to the DMSO control which was
allowed to grow in absence of cisplatin (Figure 1A, gray
bars). However, three cell lines showed unexpectedly an
enhanced cell number when they were treated with PD in
addition to cisplatin (Figure 1A, white bars). To estimate
the degree of cisplatin induced cell death, we related
the counted cell numbers to the number of seeded cells
before treatment (Figure 1B). A decreased rate of cisplatin
induced cell death was responsible for the relative increase
in cell number in the PD treated melanoma cells A375,

and 451Lu cells were treated with PD (2 µM) and LY294002 (10 µM) as indicated for 24 hours. Cell lysates were blotted and analyzed
for presence of P-AKT (Ser473), P-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and β-actin. B: A375 and LOX IMVI cells were treated with PD (2 µM)

as described in B, and lysates were analyzed by western blot. Levels of P-AKT (Ser473), P-CRAF (Ser259), P-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221)
and P-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) were determined. β-actin served as loading control. D: A375 and LOX IMVI cells were infected with

cells served as control and were set as 100%.

LOX IMVI and RPMI 7951 (Figure 1C-E). All three cell
lines show only weak apoptosis induction by PD alone
(Figure S1C). In Mel Ho and 451Lu cells, which display
high apoptosis induction by PD alone (Figure S1C), the
combination of PD and cisplatin had an additive inhibitory
effect (Figure 1B-D).
As cisplatin is a known inducer of the MAPK
pathway [16], thus possibly affecting the efficacy of PD,
we determined the extent of ERK1/2 activation after PD
treatment in absence or presence of cisplatin. An efficient
inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected under
all conditions (Figure 1E). Interestingly, the PD-mediated
apoptosis-protective effect observed in A375, LOX IMVI,
and RPMI 7951 cells went along with a solid increase in
P-AKT levels in both absence and presence of cisplatin,
indicating AKT activation (Figure 1E). Activation of
AKT was furthermore supported by the observation that
phosphorylation of the transcription factors FOXO1/3a
were enhanced at the AKT-dependent positions Thr24
and Thr32. None of these effects were detected in
the cell lines 451Lu and Mel Ho which are highly
sensitive to MEK inhibitor (Figure S3). Importantly, the
structurally unrelated MEK inhibitor U0126 had a similar

effect as PD184352 on cisplatin sensitivity and AKT
phosphorylation, as exemplified for A375 cells (Figure
S2A, B).

MEK inhibition by PD can activate AKT in a
PI3K dependent manner
To check whether Ser473 phosphorylation after
MEK inhibition is a consequence of PI3K activation, we
applied the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in addition to PD.
Elevated P-AKT Ser473 levels could be prevented by
additional administration of the PI3K inhibitor in A375,
LOX IMVI and RPMI 7951 cells (Figure 2A). In 451Lu
cells, the low P-AKT levels did not change after either
PD or LY294002 treatment. These data indicate that MEK
inhibitor induced AKT activation is mediated in a PI3K
dependent manner. To determine if PI3K activation goes
along with increased activity of its upstream activator
RAS, we performed a RAS GTPase assay (Figure 2B).
While active, GTP-bound RAS was virtually undetectable
in DMSO-treated A375 and LOX IMVI cells, MEK
inhibition led to robust RAS activation. The extent of this
activation correlated with the levels of activated AKT and

CRAF, which are induced downstream of RAS (Figure
2C). In addition, MEK1/2 phosphorylation at positions
Ser117/221 was elevated (Figure 2C). It is important to
note that PD184352 prevents MEK1/2 activation, but still
allows phosphorylation at Ser117/221 [6, 17], which might
thus accumulate when upstream signaling is enhanced.

levels (Figure 2D). P-ERK1/2 levels were not affected. In
presence of cisplatin, apoptosis was reduced in myrAKT3expressing cells, as demonstrated by reduced levels of
cleaved caspase 3 (Figure 2D) and a strong decrease of
the sub-G1 fraction compared to control cells (Figure 2E).
Altogether, similar to MEK inhibition, overexpression of
myrAKT3 enhanced the resistance to genotoxic stress.
Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K by GDC0941 enhanced the inhibitory effect of cisplatin both
in absence and in presence of MEK inhibitor (Figure
S4B). In absence of cisplatin, GDC-0941 also inhibited
cell growth in both cell lines, and this effect was further
enhanced by PD in A375 cells (Figure S4A).

The PI3K/AKT pathway mediates the protective
effect of MEK inhibitor treatment.
To address whether the observed AKT activation
could be the reason for conveying the anti-apoptotic effect,
we overexpressed constitutively active myristoylated
AKT3 (myrAKT3) in melanoma cell lines. Activated AKT
could be visualized by an increase in P-AKT (Ser473)

Reduction of PUMA mediates the protective effect
of PD towards cisplatin

melanomas, indicating the importance of a tight control
of PUMA levels during melanomagenesis [19]. Similar
to MEK inhibition, the expression of myrAKT3 reduced
PUMA levels in presence of cisplatin (Figure 3C). To
further examine the role of PUMA in cisplatin-induced
apoptosis, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of
BBC3. The knockdown diminished the cisplatin dependent
induction of BBC3 mRNA and PUMA protein levels to
a similar extent as the MEK inhibitor (compare Figure
3D and 3B). In both tested cell lines, PUMA depletion
reduced the levels of cleaved caspase 3 without affecting
DNA damage, as judged by unchanged levels of the DNA
damage indicator P-p53 (Ser15) (Figure 3E).

To find out how MEK inhibition influences
genotoxic apoptosis, we screened a human apoptosis
primer library and found a strong cisplatin-mediated
induction of BBC3 (encoding PUMA), which was
reduced by PD (Figure 3A, B) as well as U0126 (Figure
S2C). The BBC3 gene product PUMA is a BH3-only,
pro-apoptotic member of the BCL2 family. PUMA is
involved in the induction of apoptosis after DNA damage
[18] and PUMA levels are strongly reduced in human

Receptor tyrosine kinases mediate MEK inhibitorinduced AKT activation

activation, resulting in proliferation and migration [2123]. EGF treatment led to strong activation of ERK1/2
and AKT in the melanocytes (Figure S5A). In presence
of MEK inhibitor, AKT signaling was enhanced and was
maintained for a much longer timespan compared to the
controls. These data indicate that RTK signaling can
mediate the ERK1/2-PI3K crosstalk, implying a possible
involvement of RTKs in PD-mediated AKT activation
in the melanoma cell lines. A comparable experiment
was therefore conducted with the human melanoma cell
lines A375 and LOX IMVI. As these cells express many
different RTKs which could potentially be involved, they
were first starved and then treated with 10% FCS. FCS
contains numerous growth factors [24], and by using FCS
we intended to reach simultaneous activation of several
different receptors (Figure S5B). Under starved conditions,
phosphorylated AKT was almost invisible in both cell
lines. In contrast, there was a robust P-ERK1/2 signal,
which is attributed to the activating BRAFV600E mutation.
FCS stimulation led to enhanced AKT in both cell lines,

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are efficient
inducers of RAS, CRAF and AKT, which are all induced
in response to the observed MEK inhibition. RTKs
have been implicated in drug resistance in melanoma
and are involved in mediating the increased invasion
phenotype which is seen in some melanoma cells after
MEK inhibition [20]. Thus, we tested whether they
are also involved in our apoptosis-regulating crosstalk
mechanism. We first checked whether the ERK1/2-PI3K
crosstalk occurs under conditions in which ERK1/2 can be
specifically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling.
To accomplish this, we used a murine melanocyte cell line
which is transgenic for an engineered chimeric EGFR
construct (Figure S5A). When these cells are starved by
cultivation under reduced serum conditions, they become
quiescent, but can be specifically stimulated by EGFR

and, in case of A375 cells, to reduced ERK1/2 signaling
over time. Again, MEK inhibition resulted in enhanced
and longer lasting AKT activation in both melanoma
cell lines. These data indicate that the MEK inhibitor
dependent PI3K pathway activation can be mediated by
growth stimuli which are present in FCS. In case of A375
cells, MEK inhibition even induced AKT phosphorylation
in absence of FCS (Figure S5B, lane 2).
It was previously reported that transcriptional
induction of IGF1 can occur in response to BRAF
inhibition [9]. To check whether MEK inhibition could
also affect expression of RTK ligands, we investigated
the RNA levels of EGF, IGF1, PDGF and HGF in A375
and LOX IMVI cells. HGF was detected in none of the
two cell lines (data not shown), but EGF, IGF1 and PDGF
were expressed under standard growth conditions. While
MEK inhibition had no effect on any of the investigated
ligands in LOX IMVI cells, EGF and IGF1 were
significantly induced by PD in A375 cells (Figure S5C).
In case of EGF, RNA levels were increased 9-fold. EGFR
is expressed at low or moderate levels in many melanoma
cells [25] and was also detected in A375 and LOX IMVI
cells (Figure 4A). The inhibition of EGFR with the small
molecule inhibitor AG1478 had different effects on the
cell lines: A375 cells were sensitized to cisplatin, whereas
LOX IMVI cells were protected from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis to a similar extent as in presence of PD (Figure
4B). However, EGFR inhibition resensitized both cell

lines to cisplatin in presence of PD and abolished PDmediated AKT activation (Figure 4A, B).
We also investigated the impact of EGFR activation
on two cell lines which show very low (MeWo) or high
(451Lu) levels of apoptosis induction in response to PD
treatment (see Figure S1B, C). Both cell lines express
low levels of EGFR, but in MeWo cells they were slightly
higher compared to 451Lu (Figure 4C). Interestingly, EGF
stimulation led to an increase in downstream RAF/ERK1/2
and PI3K/AKT pathways in MeWo, but not in 451Lu cells
(Figure 4C and, from an independent experiment, Figure
S5D) Furthermore, EGF enhanced survival in presence
of cisplatin and PD only in MeWo cells (Figure 4C).
Consequently, EGF stimulation might be involved in PDdependent AKT activation and protection from cisplatin in
MeWo cells (Figure 4C, D).

MEK inhibition relieves several feedback loops
which contribute to PI3K pathway activation and
apoptosis resistance
The MAPK pathway is prone to tight regulation
mechanisms which guarantee the transient nature of
pathway activation under physiological conditions.
Dual specific phosphatases (DUSP), SPRY and SPRED
family proteins are induced by the RAF/MEK/ERK1/2
pathway [22, 26]. SPRY and SPRED proteins can exert

Figure 7: Scheme of the MEK inhibitor induced crosstalk mechanism. A: In absence of MEK inhibitor, BRAFV600E activation
leads to the ERK1/2-dependent induction of SPRED genes, which block RAS signaling downstream of RTKs in melanoma cells. This
results in low PI3K pathway activity. When cells are exposed to genotoxic stress, PUMA is induced and cells undergo apoptosis. B:
Application of MEK inhibitor abolishes the expression of SPRED1 and SPRED2 and thereby relieves the negative feedback on RTK
signaling. As a result, the PI3K pathway is activated. This prevents the induction of the apoptosis promoter PUMA in response to genotoxic
stress and allows enhanced survival and protection from apoptosis.

their function downstream of RTKs and were reported
to be involved in RAS regulation [27, 28]. Thus, we
hypothesized that SPRY or SPRED proteins are involved
in MEK inhibitor dependent protection from apoptosis.
Along these lines, MEK inhibition reduced RNA and
protein levels of SPRY2, SPRY4 (Figure 5A, B) as well
as SPRED1 and SPRED2 (Figure 6A, B) in A375 and
LOX IMVI cells. In addition, SPRY1 was reduced on
RNA level in A375 cells (Figure 5A). It was previously
demonstrated that a reduction of SPRY genes increases
RAS downstream signaling in melanoma [29]. To
investigate the impact of SPRY2 and -4 on protection from
apoptosis, we overexpressed dominant negative constructs
of both proteins in A375 cells. The mutants destroying
Tyr55 or Tyr53 of SPRY2 and SPRY4, respectively, are
incapable of mediating RTK feedback inhibition, but
instead act as dominant negative protein versions [30-32].
SPRY2DN, but not SPRY4DN, enhanced melanoma cell
survival in presence of cisplatin (Figure 5C). However, the
levels of activated AKT or cisplatin-induced BBC3 were
neither affected by SPRY2DN nor by SPRY4DN (Figure
5D, E), suggesting that the protection from apoptosis
by SPRY2DN occurs via an AKT/PUMA-independent
mechanism.
In addition, SPRED1 and -2 are established negative
regulators of the RAS/RAF/ERK1/2 pathway. To test
whether SPRED1 and -2 are involved in mediating the
observed ERK1/2/AKT crosstalk, we knocked down both
genes simultaneously. Again, we observed a protection
from genotoxic apoptosis (Figure 6C, Figure S6). This
went along with a modest enhancement of active RAS
and AKT (Figure 6D) and with the prevention of cisplatininduced BBC3 (Figure 6E).
In summary, our data reveal a complex RTKassociated and SPRED1/2-mediated feedback network
which can be relieved by MEK inhibition and thereby
protects from DNA damage induced apoptosis in
melanoma cells (summarized in Figure 7).

screen designed to identify genes whose disruption
convey BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanomas [34]. It is
mutated in a significant number of melanomas, including
those with BRAF inhibitor resistance [35, 36]. We could
demonstrate that siRNA-mediated reduction of functional
SPRED1 and 2 siRNA aids in enhancing RAS activity
and reducing PUMA-dependent apoptosis by genotoxic
stress. Furthermore, reduction of SPRY2 also contributed
to protection from apoptosis, as dominant negative
SPRY2 doubled the fraction of cells which survived
cisplatin treatment. Interestingly, this protective effect did
not go along with AKT induction or PUMA regulation,
suggesting an independent additional mechanism which
might contribute to the observed MEK inhibitor dependent
effect. Of note, it was recently reported that a reduction
of SPRY2 by either BRAF inhibition or siRNA enhanced
the responsiveness to exogenous ligands and thereby
enhanced mitogenic signaling [29], thus indicating that
a reduction of SPRY2 can provide conditions which also
facilitate resistance to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.
However, we also observed the downregulation of
SPRY2 and 4 as well as SPRED1 and -2 in a melanoma
cell line (451Lu) which is MEK inhibitor sensitive and
does not display enhanced AKT activation by PD (Figure
S7). We propose that the repression of SPRY and SPRED
genes is a common phenomenon in MEK inhibited
melanoma cells, but that it can only contribute to drug
resistance and protection from genotoxic damage in
presence of a permissive cellular context. Melanoma cells
which express a certain set of receptor tyrosine kinases
supposedly provide this permissive condition. Our data
indicate that EGFR belongs to the potent RTKs which
permit the MEK-inhibitor dependent AKT activation,
followed by enhanced apoptosis resistance.
In BRAFV600E mutant colorectal cancer cells, which
generally express higher levels of EGFR than melanomas,
activation of EGFR and downstream pathways occurs in
response to vemurafenib and is responsible for resistance
towards this BRAF inhibitor [37]. EGFR-expressing cells
seem to be particularly prone to feedback activation in
several cancer cell types, such as melanoma (our data
and [38]), colon cancer [37] and breast cancer [39].
Recent studies show that EGFR expression occurs in a
significant percentage of BRAF resistant melanomas,
and receptor activation, though disadvantageous under
normal conditions, becomes beneficial when the MAPK
pathway is blocked in BRAFV600E positive melanomas
[40]. Also, FOXD3-dependent upregulation of the EGFR
family member ERBB3 was described after BRAF- or
MEK inhibition in melanoma cells, resulting in enhanced
responsiveness to ERBB3 ligands and the sensitization
towards the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 by lapatinib [41].
Therefore, it is highly likely that ERBB3 also belongs to
the factors which determine the permissive environment.
Apart from receptor expression, the corresponding
set of ligands has to be expressed and shedded in order

DISCUSSION
In the present study we show that inhibition
of the MAPK pathway has the potential to protect
melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by genotoxic
damage. This effect was conveyed by activation of the
PI3K pathway which occurred shortly after the start of
MEK inhibition and was mediated by multiple factors.
Several negative feedback components including SPRY
and SPRED proteins were affected by MEK inhibition.
SPRED1 is a very efficient regulator of RAS and certain
inherited SPRED1 mutants cause the Legius syndrome
which belongs to the so-called “rasopathies” – diseases
characterized by enhanced RAS signaling [33]. SPRED1
exerts its function by binding and inhibiting neurofibromin
1 (NF1), one of the major RAS GTPase activating proteins
[28]. NF-1 was recently identified as top hit in an shRNA

to allow the protective effect of MEK inhibition towards
genotoxic stress. We found that in MeWo cells only
the addition of EGF caused the protective effect of PD
towards cisplatin, indicating that these cells do not
produce sufficient ligands to reach autocrine stimulation.
In order to produce and secrete sufficient ligands, cells
have to express a certain molecular equipment. For
example, EGFR ligands can be induced by EGFR itself
[42], by RAS [43], or IL-1β [44]. The shedding of EGFR
ligands is mainly dependent on the metalloproteases
ADAM-17 and ADAM10 [45], the latter being induced
by PAX2 in melanoma [46]. Interestingly, Vultur et al.
described recently the activation of several RTKs and the
downstream signal transducer STAT3 in 20% of MEKinhibitor treated melanoma cells [20]. They showed
that MEK inhibitor induced STAT3 activation results in
increased melanoma cell invasion. It is well possible that
their reported STAT3-dependent invasion and our AKTdependent protection from apoptosis are the consequences
from similar upstream events.
Mechanistically, we found that AKT-dependent
reduction of the pro-apoptotic effector PUMA was
involved in the protection from apoptosis. PUMA is a
FOXO1/3a target which is strongly induced in presence
of genotoxic stress [47], [48] and is implicated in the
induction of apoptosis in melanoma [49]. Importantly,
PUMA expression correlates inversely with the melanoma
malignancy grade, and weak PUMA expression is
associated with poorer overall survival [19]. By reducing
PUMA levels, MEK-inhibition can therefore evoke
unexpected pro-tumorigenic effects, even in BRAFV600Emutant melanomas. It is however possible that apart from
PUMA, other AKT downstream targets also contribute to
the observed anti-apoptotic effect.
Compensatory PI3K pathway activation might be
a serious problem in the clinical setting, where BRAFand MEK inhibitors can encounter intrinsic [50-52] as
well as acquired [5, 9] PI3K pathway reactivation which
is likely involved in tumor relapse. After the tumors
reappear, chemotherapeutic and DNA damaging agents
are often applied, usually without benefit for the patient.
The reason for this might be found, at least partially, in
the apoptosis resistance conferred by PI3K pathway
activation. Consequently, PI3K pathway inhibitor
combination therapies are a promising approach. There are
encouraging preclinical data addressing this strategy. In
melanoma cell lines, acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance
is overcome by simultaneous MEK and PI3K/mTOR
inhibition [53]. Along these lines, combined MEK and
PI3K/mTORC inhibition also leads to tumor regression in
murine melanoma models driven by mutant RAS [54]. In
cancer patients, dual inhibition of BRAF/MEK/ERK1/2
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is in phase I clinical
trials [55]. So far, only few melanoma patients were
enrolled in this study, and it is too early to state whether
the dual inhibition strategy is more successful than BRAF

inhibitor monotherapy.
In summary, our data demonstrate that MEK
inhibition of BRAFV600E-positive melanoma cells can lead
to AKT-dependent enhanced apoptosis resistance towards
genotoxic stress, implying a careful choice of pathway
inhibitors in combination therapies.
