BACKGROUND: African Americans in the United States have higher rates of colon cancer mortality than other races.
This study examines the use of oxaliplatin, a novel chemotherapeutic agent approved in 2004, among African American
and Caucasian American patients with stage III colon cancer to determine whether differential receipt or differential
effectiveness of the drug may explain the racial disparity in colon cancer mortality. METHODS: The authors conducted
a population-based retrospective cohort study of stage III colon cancer patients aged 65 years and older treated
from 2004 through 2006 who initiated chemotherapy within 90 days of surgical resection (N ¼ 1162) using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. Patients receiving oxaliplatin (n ¼ 477) were compared with
those receiving 5-fluorouracil without oxaliplatin (n ¼ 685). The authors estimated prevalence ratios and hazard ratios
(HRs) using multivariate binomial regression and Cox models to evaluate racial differences in oxaliplatin receipt and
survival. RESULTS: African Americans were as likely as Caucasian Americans to receive oxaliplatin (40.5 vs 41.1%;
prevalence ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.13). Oxaliplatin was associated with lower mortality compared with 5-fluorouracil (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00). This benefit appeared stronger among African Americans (HR,
0.31; 95% CI, 0.09-1.05) than Caucasian Americans (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: In Medicare-insured
patients receiving chemotherapy, the authors observed no meaningful racial disparities in receipt of oxaliplatin and,
among those receiving it, potentially better survival among African Americans. Differential receipt and effectiveness of
oxaliplatin-containing regimens does not appear to contribute to the previously documented racial disparities in colon
cancer survival. Understanding reasons for potentially enhanced effectiveness among African Americans may inform

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 41.1
cases per 100,000 people per year.1 In 2011, >141,000 new cases are expected, approximately 1=3 of which will be diagnosed
as stage III. Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with >51,000 people expected to die from it this year.
Racial disparities in mortality are substantial; African Americans are approximately 44% more likely to die from colon cancer
than Caucasian Americans.2 Thanks to improved screening and the introduction of several innovative treatments, colon cancer mortality has declined since the 1980s, but has not declined equivalently among races.3,4 This disparity may result from
differential dissemination of the innovative treatments in different subpopulations, or differential effectiveness among them.
Many factors contribute to racial differences in access to care, care utilization, and outcomes. For example, African American mistrust of physicians, lack of a regular source of care, and poor continuity of care have been associated with lower use of preventive services, delays in treatment, and lower quality of follow-up, and subsequently worse outcomes.5-12 In sum, real

world care may fall short of optimal patient management.
Adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES) may account for
some of the differences attributed to race; however, in
studies controlling for these factors, the mortality gap
between races remains.13,14 After SES adjustment, African
American patients are less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable colorectal cancer than Caucasian
Americans,15-17 suggesting that there may be disparities in
the use of the more effective and/or innovative drugs.
However, we do not have good data on racial differences
in the receipt of specific chemotherapies among treated
colon cancer patients.
Innovative therapies might also have a heterogeneous effect on outcome in different races, as there is substantial evidence that an individual’s genetic makeup
may affect the effectiveness and toxicity of systemic
chemotherapy (pharmacogenetics). In colorectal cancer,
there are many examples of genotypic association with
chemotherapy outcomes such as UGT1A1*28 allele and
irinotecan toxicity, and thymidylate synthase TYMS 50 untranslated enhanced region polymorphism and 5-fluorouracil benefit.18-20 New evidence suggests that chemotherapy, and specifically oxaliplatin, may cause fewer
side effects in African Americans,21-23 which could lead
to better drug delivery, adherence, and persistence, and
ultimately greater effectiveness. However, this would be
expected to improve mortality in African Americans
and therefore cannot explain the observed mortality
gap.
The standard of care for stage III colon cancer is surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy.24 In 2004,
oxaliplatin was US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved for stage III colon cancer and, used in
combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil (ie, the FOLFOX regimen), replaced 5-fluorouracil alone, the prior
standard adjuvant therapy. At that time, FOLFOX was
shown to improve disease-free survival over 5-fluorouracil
(rate of 72.2% vs 65.3%)25 and subsequently to improve
survival in patients with stage III colon cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.661.11).26 However, potential racial differences in effectiveness were not adequately examined in the clinical trials,
which had much less racially diverse populations than the
general colon cancer population. Moreover, differential
access to care cannot effectively be examined in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
To examine whether the racial disparity in colon
cancer mortality can be partially explained by either access
to innovative treatments or differential treatment effec-

tiveness, this study evaluated a heterogeneous populationbased sample27 for racial differences in the use and comparative effectiveness of FOLFOX, a combination chemotherapy including the novel drug oxaliplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
A population-based retrospective cohort was drawn
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-linked Medicare data, which have been
described extensively elsewhere.28 Briefly, the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) SEER program collects clinical
and demographic data on incident cancers and covers
approximately 28% of the US population. Medicare is
US public health insurance that insures approximately
97% of those aged 65 years in the United States. The
linkage of Medicare claims with SEER provides critical
information on patient demographics, cancer characteristics, health care utilization, and comorbidities, and has
been used extensively to study cancer patterns of care
and outcomes.29
Patient Population and Sample
The study cohort included individuals diagnosed with primary stage III colon cancer who were first treated between
January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2006, the years immediately after determination of oxaliplatin efficacy and
FDA approval. Included patients received surgical resection (colectomy or resection of colon or large intestine)
within 180 days of diagnosis and initiated the first course
of chemotherapy within 90 days of surgery. All patients
received 1 of the 2 chemotherapies of interest: 5-fluorouracil without oxaliplatin (the previously standard therapy)
or an oxaliplatin-containing regimen (the innovative therapy). Additional exclusion criteria (Fig. 1) include:
incomplete claims or health maintenance organization
coverage during the 12 months before and after diagnosis
or until death, to ensure attainment of treatment and procedure claims; age younger than 65 years, as these individuals may be systematically different or have incomplete
claims as a function of Medicare eligibility requirements;
diagnosis at autopsy; appendix or rectosigmoid junction
cancer; death within 30 days of surgery, as these patients
are unlikely to have received chemotherapy because of
fragile health status; and race other than Caucasian American or African American. The sample was restricted to
patients from SEER registry regions with 5% or greater
African American populations.

income, and radiation, was obtained through SEER data.
Race is considered an accurate variable in SEER for African
Americans and Caucasian Americans.31 Chemotherapy,
comorbidities, and procedures were identified through
Health Care Procedure Classification Codes, National
drug codes, Current Procedural Terminology, and International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes in
Medicare claims. Comorbidity was adjusted for using the
NCI Combined Comorbidity Index, adapted from the
SEER-Medicare program.32 This index was constructed
using claims for the 12 months before diagnosis.33

Definition of Cohorts
FOLFOX was defined as the presence of an oxaliplatin
claim, because oxaliplatin is the defining drug of the FOLFOX regimen and the innovative treatment of interest.
The referent treatment group received 5-fluorouracil, the
prior standard for chemotherapy, and had no claims for
oxaliplatin. Those receiving other treatments with 5-fluorouracil (eg, irinotecan) were included in the referent
group. An exposure window of 150 days from diagnosis
was used to ensure inclusion of all patients treated according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/National
Comprehensive Cancer Network quality standards. These
guidelines recommend administering adjuvant chemotherapy within 120 days of diagnosis for stage III colon
cancer,30 and a 30-day buffer was added because SEERMedicare does not contain the specific diagnosis date
(month/year only). Patients who received chemotherapy
before surgery are likely stage IV patients misclassified as
stage III and were not included.
Mortality Follow-up and Covariates
Mortality follow-up started 90 days after surgery irrespective of when chemotherapy was initiated. Date of death
was ascertained from Medicare data, which is drawn from
the US Social Security Administration, and was available
in these data through December 31, 2006. Race, the primary covariate of interest, along with other adjustment

Analytic Methods
Frequency tables and comparisons of covariates by treatment group and race were examined as part of a descriptive analysis. Treatment proportions were compared to
examine whether African Americans were as likely to
receive oxaliplatin-based treatments as Caucasian Americans. Crude and adjusted binomial regression models
were constructed to estimate prevalence ratios for treatment assignment by race. Crude all-cause 3-year mortality
was computed for patients who had 3 years of follow-up
or who died during the study time period to compare risk
of death between Caucasian Americans and African
Americans. Cox models including all patients were used
to estimate crude and adjusted HRs for overall mortality
comparing African Americans versus Caucasian Americans and the initiation of FOLFOX versus 5-fluorouracil
regimens in an intent-to-treat approach based on all available follow-up information. HR estimates for race as a
predictor of death were then compared, first unadjusted
and then adjusted for oxaliplatin receipt. Cox models
were constructed in a subgroup analysis to examine differences in oxaliplatin effectiveness between races. We measured the interaction of race and oxaliplatin on mortality
using the interaction contrast ratio,34,35 as the additive
scale (joint effects) is most appropriate when investigating
biologic interactions and for clinical decision making.36
Proportional hazard assumptions were tested and confirmed using log likelihood tests and graphical methods.
To compare survival by race among those who received
oxaliplatin, adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
generated. All analyses were performed using SAS (version
9.2.; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Directed acyclic graph methodology was used to
identify potential confounders.37 Independent variables
identified as important for adjustment in all models were
age, sex, urban/rural status, tumor grade, tumor substage,
site of tumor, SEER registry, median income, radiation,

Patients with surgery >90 days after diagnosis could have
been erroneously categorized as stage III when in fact they
already had metastatic disease. Third, to examine potential biases in the manner that follow-up time was calculated in Cox models, analyses were rerun with an origin of
30 days after the first date of 5-fluorouracil receipt instead
of using 90 days after surgery.

RESULTS
Study Population and Oxaliplatin Use
In descriptive analyses (Table 1), treatment groups were
similar. Those receiving oxaliplatin (n ¼ 477) were slightly
younger, had less comorbidity, and were in higher income
brackets that those receiving 5-fluorouracil without oxaliplatin (n ¼ 685). Oxaliplatin use was greater among those diagnosed in 2005 than in 2004 (56.4% vs 43.6%) as the
innovation diffused into practice. African Americans comprised 10% (n ¼ 116) of the study population. There was
variation in racial distribution among SEER registries; in
addition, African Americans were more likely to be female
and were generally in a lower income bracket than Caucasian
Americans. African Americans were as likely as Caucasian
Americans to receive oxaliplatin (40.5% vs 41.1%; adjusted
prevalence ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71-1.13).
Mortality and Oxaliplatin Effectiveness
Overall mortality among all cohort subjects was 28.8%
(n ¼ 335) over a mean follow-up of 2.4 years. Oxaliplatin was
protective in terms of lower mortality compared with 5-fluorouracil regimens (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-1.00).
Mortality among African American patients with
stage III colon cancer who were treated with chemotherapy tended to be lower than that of Caucasian American
patients (adjusted overall HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.56-1.28;
Table 2), with a 3-year mortality risk of 32.5% versus
39.3% (P ¼ .34). HR estimates did not appreciably
change when adjusted for receipt of oxaliplatin (adjusted
HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56-1.28).
Fewer than 11 of 41 African Americans on oxaliplatin died, compared with 23 of 69 African Americans who

died on 5-fluorouracil (the exact number is suppressed
because of SEER-Medicare confidentiality requirements).
The protective effect from oxaliplatin compared with 5fluorouracil was more profound in African Americans than
Caucasian Americans (adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.621.09 for Caucasian Americans and adjusted HR, 0.31;
95% CI, 0.12-0.82 for African Americans; Figs 2 and 3).
The formal examination of the race-oxaliplatin interaction
on mortality (assessment of joint effects) also demonstrates
a greater benefit of oxaliplatin among African Americans
(Table 3). The absolute difference in the benefit between
races was estimated as 57% of the hazard rate among the
Caucasian Americans receiving 5-fluorouracil (interaction
contrast ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 1.19 to 0.05).
Sensitivity Analyses
To assess if the inclusion of other races with Caucasian
Americans would change or bias the study results, a

2929

Original Article

sensitivity analysis compared African Americans
(n ¼ 116) with Caucasian Americans and all other races
(n ¼ 1098), rather than with Caucasian Americans alone
(n ¼ 1046). The associations between race and mortality
and between race and oxaliplatin receipt were essentially
unchanged. The small sample size of other races (n ¼ 52
not Caucasian American or African American) precluded
this group’s independent examination in comparison to
African Americans. Narrowing the timing of surgery after
diagnosis from 180 to 90 days excluded 42 additional
patients, but estimates were equal in magnitude to the
main analysis. Similarly, using an origin of 30 days after
the first date of 5-fluorouracil receipt instead of 90 days
after surgery excluded 84 patients but yielded no meaningful change in mortality HRs.

DISCUSSION
In this study examining whether racial disparities in colon
cancer mortality may be partly attributed to differential
receipt or effectiveness of oxaliplatin, we found that,
among older individuals with resected stage III disease,
not only were African Americans and Caucasian Americans equally likely to receive oxaliplatin, but oxaliplatin
unexpectedly appeared to be more effective among African Americans than Caucasian Americans. Overall, oxaliplatin-treated patients had lower mortality than patients
treated with nonoxaliplatin regimens, a finding consistent
with RCTs and recent observational comparative effectiveness research results.26,38 Although the study findings
do not explain racial disparities in colon cancer mortality,
the results overall are meaningful in our understanding of
colon cancer treatment and racial disparities.
Differential Mortality
Our finding that African American patients experienced
slightly lower mortality than Caucasian Americans is contrary to the findings of other studies.14,39,40 This may be
because of the equal access to overall medical coverage
experienced by those in the study, who were all Medicare
subscribers. It could also be that racial minorities enter at
a later stage in the cancer care continuum,41 but that once
engaged in the health care system, any differences in the
care they receive have little effect on mortality. The resources made available through Medicare participation to individuals in this study, who have accessed the health care
system and been diagnosed with cancer, may have essentially eliminated the disparity in access to care after diagnosis, and thus eliminated the disparity in mortality.
Indeed, in a study of stage III colorectal cancer patients
treated at Veterans Affairs hospitals where all patients have
equal access to medical care, there were no racial

differences in receipt of appropriate colorectal cancer
therapies and minimal racial differences in all-cause mortality.42 As they pertain to differential access among individuals not covered by Medicare, our data offer little
utility; the SEER-Medicare data reflect a population with
health insurance, although distance/access to providers,
copayments, and deductibles can still be substantial barriers to receiving care among insured populations. This
study used census-level measures of SES, which are limited
in their ability to remove all SES-related confounding.
Possible Racial Differences in Oxaliplatin
Effectiveness
The relatively equal receipt of oxaliplatin between races
coupled with the better survival of African Americans suggests that there could be differences in oxaliplatin effectiveness based on race. This is meaningful, given that the
proportion of minorities in RCTs of oxaliplatin efficacy
was substantially smaller than the overall population with
colon cancer, as well as younger and healthier, and that
seminal reports of oxaliplatin efficacy have not reported
race-specific outcomes.26,43,44 Race-stratified HRs as well
as the analysis of joint effects showed that oxaliplatin was
potentially more protective among African Americans as
compared with Caucasian Americans. This is a novel finding that has generally not been seen in clinical trials,
although other possible differences in oxaliplatin effectiveness have been described. Within a subgroup analysis of a
large RCT comparing bolus irinotecan/fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin/infusional fluorouracil/leucovorin
and bolus irinotecan and oxaliplatin,21 African Americans
were found to be less likely to experience severe adverse
events from chemotherapy compared with Caucasian
Americans. However, this trial also found that the response
rate to oxaliplatin was lower among African Americans
compared with Caucasian Americans, which is contrary to
our finding. If African Americans do have fewer side effects
during treatment, it is possible that they have greater treatment completion rates than Caucasian Americans when
taking oxaliplatin and are better able to maintain dose intensity and dose density. If true, this improved drug delivery might result in better outcomes in clinical practice.
Alternate Explanations
Another plausible reason for a more pronounced mortality
reduction in African Americans receiving oxaliplatin is
channeling away from oxaliplatin in frail patients (ie,

neling could be because of different prescribing or different decision making among African Americans compared
with Caucasian Americans, which has been shown in previous studies.45,46 Clinicians may be less likely to use a
more aggressive treatment such as oxaliplatin among
patients who are sicker and thus potentially more likely to
experience the risks of treatment without its prospective
benefit.47,48 It is possible that African Americans in this
study were sicker than Caucasian Americans but that we
were unable to see this difference in the data set used,
because health status measures such as frailty and functional status are not available in Medicare data. We did
adjust for comorbidities found within the 12 months
before cancer diagnosis, but differences in health status
may still exist and yield residual confounding, which
could be problematic when looking at mortality.
It is also possible that by removing those not treated
with any chemotherapy, we may have excluded the
patients who contribute to the gap in mortality between
races. A similar proportion of both races was excluded for
not receiving any chemotherapy within 90 days of surgery,
however, so this is unlikely. As in all analyses, chance
could also account for our results. In our final patient
population, there were small numbers of African Americans who died while on oxaliplatin, which limited our
ability to construct precise estimates; future studies with
more events are warranted.

Limitations and Sensitivity Analyses
Use of claims data has potential limitations that have been
well described.49-51 We used state-of-the-art methods to
minimize these acknowledged biases. In the overall analyses, we excluded races other than African American or
Caucasian American, and then performed sensitivity analyses, which suggested that results would not appreciably
differ if we had compared African Americans to all races.
In SEER, there is an estimated 80% concordance with diagnosis date and timing of claims for colon cancer,52 but
only month and year of diagnosis are provided; therefore,
index dates must be estimated. We built a time buffer to
take this into account by adding 30 days to the recommended treatment window and using the first day of the
previous month as an index date for finding surgeries and
chemotherapies. We also took a conservative approach for
inclusion, allowing patients who received surgery up to
180 days after diagnosis in the study. Sensitivity analyses
suggest that the results would be similar if surgery timing
after diagnosis were restricted to 90 days.

Original Article

Because Medicare is estimated to have 75% sensitivity for picking up 5-fluorouracil,53 we may have missed a
proportion of the referent group. To avoid missing a considerable proportion of FOLFOX users, we used evidence
of treatment with oxaliplatin to define our exposure rather
than requiring evidence of all medications in the FOLFOX regimen. Exposure misclassification would be possible for those who started 5-fluorouracil toward the end of
the 150-day claims window defined by this study and
started oxaliplatin after the 150-day window. This misclassification is likely small and would tend to bias results toward the null. Within the referent group, few patients
were on other chemotherapeutic agents in addition to 5fluorouracil; 5.8% received irinotecan, and 1.2% received
bevacizumab. Sensitivity analyses excluding these patients
from the referent group demonstrated no difference in
findings (data not shown).
To ensure comparability of our results with previous
work, mortality follow-up began 90 days after surgery irrespective of when chemotherapy was initiated. All included
patients had started chemotherapy by this landmark. Primary results were essentially unchanged in sensitivity analyses beginning follow-up closer to chemotherapy start (30
days after first date of 5-fluorouracil).
Overall Findings
This is the largest population-based study assessing race-specific channeling and comparative effectiveness of oxaliplatin
to date. Our findings of potential heterogeneity of effect in
different races highlight the need for additional comparative
effectiveness research on these therapies.54 By using the
SEER-Medicare data set, we have been able to demonstrate
that oxaliplatin retains its effectiveness among an unselected
group of elderly colon cancer patients to a similar degree as
seen in clinical trials. Furthermore, we have shown that elderly African American colon cancer patients, who are
markedly underrepresented in clinical trials, derive as much
if not more benefit from the addition of oxaliplatin.
Conclusions
In Medicare-insured stage III colon cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, we observed no meaningful racial disparities in receipt of oxaliplatin, the more effective
treatment, and potentially better survival among African
Americans. Differential receipt or effectiveness of oxaliplatin-containing regimens does not appear to contribute
to previously reported racial disparities in colon cancer
survival. Rather, our findings suggest that oxaliplatin may
act more effectively in African Americans, although small

2932

numbers and other limitations require confirmatory
research. This, combined with new evidence that oxaliplatin effectiveness may vary with biological differences,
highlights the importance of future studies examining
oxaliplatin effectiveness by race.
