BACKGROUND: Phase 3 studies of bevacizumab in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APCA) demonstrated no improvement in outcome. To the authors’ knowledge, no validated predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab exist, although emerging data
suggest that subsets of patients with APCA may benefit from treatment with bevacizumab. The authors evaluated baseline serum
albumin (b-alb) as a predictive biomarker in a pooled analysis from 7 prospective clinical trials of gemcitabine-based therapy with
or without bevacizumab. METHODS: Data were collected from individual databases from 7 prospective clinical trials. Patients were
grouped by exposure to bevacizumab and by b-alb level ( 3.4 g/L or < 3.4 g/dL). Overall survival (OS), time to disease progression (TTP), overall response rate, and disease control rate (overall response rate plus stable disease lasting  16 weeks) were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariable analyses of prognostic factors were performed. RESULTS: A total of 264
patients were included. The median age was 59 years (range, 31 years-85 years) and all patients had stage IV disease per TNM
staging. Normal b-alb was associated with significantly improved median OS (10.2 months vs 4.1 months; P 5.0001), median TTP
(6.2 months vs 3.7 months; P 5 0.0488), and disease control rate (71% vs 46%; P 5.007) for patients receiving bevacizumab, but
not for those treated without bevacizumab. Multivariable analysis revealed a significant influence of normal b-alb on OS
(P 5.0008) and TTP (P 5.033). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APCA with normal b-alb derive benefit from treatment with bevacizumab. Future prospective investigations of bevacizumab in patients with APCA should consider selecting patients with normal b-alb

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer (PCA) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer death in United States.1 The prognosis for patients
with advanced disease is poor, with the majority surviving < 6 months with standard gemcitabine therapy.2 Although a 4month survival benefit was recently reported with the combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX),3 the toxicities of this regimen prohibit its use in the majority of patients with metastatic disease.
Recently presented data indicate a less impressive but significant 1.8-month survival benefit from the addition of nabpaclitaxel to gemcitabine in patients with metastatic PCA.4 Despite these advances, there is a continuous need to further
improve survival through the investigation of molecularly targeted agents.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prevents it from interacting with its receptors (VEGFR).5 Although preclinical data have suggested VEGF as a promising therapeutic target in PCA,6-8 3 phase 3 trials of gemcitabine plus antiangiogenic therapy with

bevacizumab9,10 or the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib11 failed to reach their primary endpoint of
overall survival (OS) in unselected patients.
Efforts have been made to identify predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab efficacy in patients with PCA;
however, to the best of our knowledge none have been
validated to date. Exploratory analyses from the AViTA
trial9 suggested that a subset of patients with elevated
VEGFA or VEGFR2 levels may benefit from bevacizumab.12 These results suggest that angiogenesis remains an
interesting therapeutic target in patients with PCA and
further investigation is needed to identify subsets of
patients who may benefit from this treatment approach.
Pharmacokinetic analyses of bevacizumab have shown
that patients with a low baseline serum albumin (b-alb) experience a 15% to 20% increase in the rate of bevacizumab
clearance.13Although the clinical implications of this phenomenon are not well understood, exposure to lower therapeutic levels of bevacizumab could adversely impact clinical
outcome. We recently reported a significant improvement in
OS and time to disease progression (TTP) for patients with
advanced PCA (APCA) and a b-alb level  3.4 g/dL who
were treated on a phase 2 study of gemcitabine, infusional 5fluorouracil, and bevacizumab.16 Our data suggested that this
subset of patients may derive significant benefit from bevacizumab, and that the potential predictive value of b-alb should
be further investigated in patients with APCA.
To further investigate the role of b-alb as a biomarker for bevacizumab efficacy in patients with APCA,
we evaluated clinical outcomes according to b-alb using
pooled data from 7 prospective studies of gemcitabinebased therapy with or without bevacizumab.

University, University of Michigan, Roswell Park Cancer
Institute, University of California at San Francisco, The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and
the University of Oklahoma (Table 1).16-22 Raw data
were collected from each clinical trial database before
pooled analysis, including patient demographics, known
prognostic factors (including disease stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status,
baseline CA 19-9, and change in CA 19-9 with treatment), b-alb level (< 3.4 g/dL or  3.4 g/dL) measured
within 7 days of treatment initiation, and clinical outcome measures (including objective response rate [ORR],
disease control rate [DCR; ORR plus stable disease
lasting  16 weeks], TTP, and OS) for all patients.
Patients were grouped according to treatment with bevacizumab (group 1) or no bevacizumab (group 2) and clinical outcomes of interest were assessed within each group
and for all patients according to b-alb. The primary objectives of the current study were to determine the predictive
and/or prognostic value of b-alb in patients with APCA
and specifically those treated with bevacizumab.
Eligibility

Studies selected for pooled analysis were required to
include patients with APCA proven by cytology or histology. To limit potential confounding factors for clinical
outcomes, studies for pooled analysis (both bevacizumab
and nonbevacizumab studies) had strict inclusion criteria,
including the availability of b-alb data. Patients included
in the raw database were required to have stage IV disease,
an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1, no prior treatment for metastatic disease, and a b-alb value collected
within 7 days of treatment initiation. Treatment was
required to be gemcitabine-based for inclusion in the current analyses and would include bevacizumab at a dose of
5 mg/kg/week with the various dosing schedules. All studies included were approved by the respective Institutional
Review Boards at each institution.

Statistical Analysis

Clinical outcomes were defined as follows: OS was defined
as the time from first treatment until death from any cause,
TTP was defined as the time from first treatment until disease progression, ORR was defined as the percentage of
patients achieving a complete or partial response by
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria used in each individual study, and DCR was defined
as the percentage of patients achieving an objective response
or stable disease for  16 weeks. Patients who were lost to
follow-up or who were still alive were censored at the date of
their last visit. Patient characteristics were summarized using
descriptive statistics and graphical analyses as part of exploratory data analyses. Factors were compared between groups
of interest (eg, protocol treatment, bevacizumab vs not, low
b-alb vs not) using 2-sample Student t tests for continuous
measures and chi-square tests for categorical markers or their
nonparametric equivalents in the cases in which assumptions did not hold. The clinical outcomes described above
were compared between groups of interest. For dichotomous outcomes such as ORR and DCR, univariate and
multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate differences. Goodness of fit for logistic regression models
was assessed based on the methods of Hosmer and Lemeshow.23 For TTP and OS, univariate and multivariable Cox
regression models24 were used to assess the prognostic influence of clinical factors. Proportional hazards were tested
using the methods of Therneau and Grambsch.25 KaplanMeier26 methods were also used to assess differences in these
distributions graphically and log-rank tests27 were used to
quantitatively evaluate differences in survival distributions.
Statistical significance was declared for P values < .05.

disease (1 patient), or lack of an available b-alb value
(7 patients). A total of 264 patients were therefore
included in the raw data analysis. Patient characteristics
are outlined in Table 2, and were balanced between
groups 1 and 2 (bevacizumab vs no bevacizumab, respectively). Continuous measures of b-alb were found to be
similar in both treatment groups (measure 1: 3.8 g/dL;
and measure 2: 3.8 g/dL [P 5 .7]). The percentage of
patients with low b-alb (< 3.4 g/dL) was also similar in
groups 1 and 2 (21% vs 16%; P 5 .47) (Table 2).

Characteristics of Included Clinical Trials

When combining all patients, a b-alb level  3.4 g/dL was
found to be associated with significantly improved OS
(median, 9.6 months vs 4.9 months; hazards ratio [HR],
0.8 [P 5 .0005]), TTP (median 5.8 months vs 3.4
months; HR, 0.69 [P 5 .04]), and ORR and DCR
(ORR: 24% vs 10% [P 5 .043]; DCR: 65% vs 43%
[P 5 .007]). Using multivariable analysis adjusted for
known clinical prognostic factors and receipt of bevacizumab, b-alb remained a significant independent predictor
of OS (P 5 .0009) (Fig. 1 Top), TTP (P 5 .04) (Fig. 1
Bottom), and DCR (P 5 .008) and was found to have
borderline significance for ORR (P 5 .053).
In patients specifically treated with bevacizumab, a
b-alb level  3.4 g/dL was found to be associated with a
significant improvement in OS (median, 10.2 months vs
4.1 months; HR, 2.1 [P 5 .0001]) (Fig. 2 Top), TTP

Seven prospective clinical trials were included in these
analyses (Table 1).16-22 All trials involved gemcitabinebased therapy, and 4 trials included bevacizumab. Only 2
of these trials met their primary endpoint.16,19 All studies
included patients with APCA. Patient characteristics by
study included in these analyses demonstrated some differences in clinical factors, including ECOG performance
status distribution (P 5 .0003), sex distribution
(P 5 .03), and percentage of patients with a b-alb level < 3.4 g/dL (P 5 .014). Median age and CA 19-9 level
were found to be similar among the studies.

have had negative results in unselected patients.9-11 Increasing evidence suggests that proper patient selection through
the identification and use of predictive biomarkers may
maximize the efficacy of targeted anticancer therapies. To
the best of our knowledge, no such predictive biomarkers
for bevacizumab have been validated in any advanced
malignancy, although recent exploratory data have suggested baseline VEGFA levels may correlate with clinical
outcomes.12 Our previous investigations indicated that a balb level  3.4 g/dL may be predictive of bevacizumab efficacy and warranted further investigation.
The results of the current study suggest a predictive
role for b-alb in patients with APCA receiving bevacizumab, independent of other prognostic factors. Our analyses revealed that b-alb significantly influenced clinical
outcome in those patients with regimens that included
bevacizumab, but did not appear to impact survival outcomes in those patients who did not receive bevacizumab.
In addition, in our analysis of patients with APCA who
were treated with bevacizumab, a b-alb level < 3.4 g/dL
was found to remain a strong independent predictor of inferior outcomes for patients with APCA receiving bevacizumab, after adjusting for other clinical covariates. The
current study data suggest that b-alb has a prognostic role
in patients with APCA who are treated with bevacizumab,
and is a potential predictive marker for survival outcomes
in those patients despite combination treatments with
other agents. The literature suggests that this finding may
be confounded by the association between low b-alb with
other factors associated with poor prognosis, including
older age, poor ECOG performance status, more aggres1784

sive or advanced disease, poor nutritional status, or hepatic dysfunction. In the analysis cohort in the current
study, b-alb proved to be significantly associated with
clinical outcomes even when we adjusted for ECOG performance status and patient age. Therefore, despite the
previously reported prognostic significance of b-alb
regardless of treatment, the results of the current study
indicate a novel use for b-alb as a predictive biomarker in
patients with APCA receiving bevacizumab. Furthermore,
to the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
report of the predictive or prognostic value of b-alb specifically in patients with APCA.
The predictive value of b-alb may be explained by a
pharmacokinetic description of bevacizumab. A small exploratory analysis suggested a 15% increased rate of bevacizumab clearance for patients with colon cancer with
lower b-alb who were treated with bevacizumab. This was
independent of prognostic variables such as age, sex, tumor stage, and ECOG performance status, all of which
were found to have no impact on bevacizumab clearance.13 A larger study using pooled data from 8 clinical
trials found that patients with a b-alb level  2.9 g/dL
experienced a 20% increase in their rate of bevacizumab
clearance.14
The interpretation of the findings of the current
study is limited by their retrospective nature and the relatively small sample size of the group not treated with bevacizumab, although these results were strengthened by the
choice of study design. Unlike a meta-analysis, a pooled
analysis includes individual patient data that were prospectively collected within the context of a clinical trial,

which improves the strength and statistical significance of
the final results. An additional potential weakness of the
current study is that relatively small numbers of patients
had low b-alb levels. However, the overall results are
strengthened by the relatively large sample size of the
study population enrolled at multiple participating institutions, including a meaningful control population of
patients treated without bevacizumab. Finally, although
there was some heterogeneity with regard to treatment
and prognostic factors among the 7 individual studies
included, we demonstrated the absence of a significant
difference in these prognostic factors between groups in
our pooled data set.
In conclusion, we identified b-alb as a potential predictive biomarker for the efficacy of bevacizumab in
patients with APCA. In addition, the results of the current
study suggest a likely prognostic role for b-alb in patients
with APCA who are being treated with bevacizumab,
regardless of other agents being used in combination with
bevacizumab. Future prospective investigations of bevacizumab in patients with APCA should continue and
should consider selecting patients with normal b-alb to
maximize potential benefit. Finally, although the current
study focused on patients with APCA, the findings have
potential applicability to other advanced malignancies in
which bevacizumab is currently under study or represents
a standard of care.
