ABSTRACT
MGMT expression is a critical determinant for therapeutic resistance to DNA
alkylating agents. We previously demonstrated that MGMT expression is posttranscriptionally regulated by miR-181d and other miRNAs. Here, we performed a
genome-wide screen to identify MGMT regulating miRNAs. Candidate miRNAs were
further tested for inverse correlation with MGMT expression in clinical specimens.
We identified 15 candidate miRNAs and characterized the top candidate, miR-603.
Transfection of miR-603 suppressed MGMT mRNA/protein expression in vitro and in
vivo; this effect was reversed by transfection with antimiR-603. miR-603 affinityprecipitated with MGMT mRNA and suppressed luciferase activity in an MGMT3’UTR-luciferase assay, suggesting direct interaction between miR-603 and MGMT
3’UTR. miR-603 transfection enhanced the temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity of MGMTexpressing glioblastoma cell lines. Importantly, miR-603 mediated MGMT suppression
and TMZ resistance were reversed by expression of an MGMT cDNA. In a collection
of 74 clinical glioblastoma specimens, both miR-603 and miR-181d levels inversely
correlated with MGMT expression. Moreover, a combined index of the two miRNAs
better reflected MGMT expression than each individually. These results suggest that
MGMT is co-regulated by independent miRNAs. Characterization of these miRNAs
should contribute toward strategies for enhancing the efficacy of DNA alkylating
agents.

INTRODUCTION

tested [4], high MGMT expression is associated with
cellular resistance to DNA alkylating agents. Clinically,
high MGMT mRNA and protein expression have been
associated with therapeutic resistance to DNA alkylating
agents in a number of cancers [5].
A major mechanism of MGMT regulation involves
methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region
[6]. Methylation of these regions suppresses MGMT
transcription [7, 8]. This mechanism of regulation is
particularly important in glioblastoma, the most common

O6-methylguanine methyl transferase (MGMT)
encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein, the primary
function of which is to repair guanine nucleotides that
are alkylated at the O6 position [1]. O6-methyl guanine
constitutes the major cytotoxic lesion induced by
DNA alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, including
temozolomide [2]. In model organisms spanning the
entire evolutionary ladder [3] and in every cell line

form of primary brain cancer [9]. MGMT promoter
methylation has been associated with favorable response
to temozolomide in three randomized controlled trials,
including EORTC-NCIC [10], NOA-8 [11], and the
Nordic Trial [12].
While MGMT promoter status has been
associated with therapeutic response to temozolomide
for glioblastoma patients, there has been reluctance to
restrict temozolomide treatment to patients harboring
MGMT promoter methylated glioblastomas [13, 14].
One of the major reasons underlying this reluctance is the
observation that a significant portion of MGMT promoter
unmethylated tumors harbor MGMT levels comparable
to those with methylated MGMT promoters [7, 15, 16].
These findings suggest that many glioblastoma patients
with unmethylated MGMT can still derive benefit from
temozolomide treatment. Thus, understanding the
mechanism underlying the heterogeneity of MGMT
expression can fundamentally impact clinical care of
glioblastoma patients.
Our previous work showed that the low MGMT
expression in promoter unmethylated tumors was due
in part to the expression of miR-181d, a miRNA that
suppresses MGMT expression [17]. However, our analysis
indicated that additional miRNAs may be involved in
regulating MGMT expression. Here, we identify miR-603
as another MGMT regulating miRNA. We demonstrate
that miR-603 binds directly to the MGMT 3’UTR and
results in a loss of MGMT protein expression both in vitro
and in vivo. In addition, we show that miR-603 and miR181d cooperate to regulate MGMT expression.

miRNAs predicted to bind to MGMT-3’UTR by DIANA
microTv3.0 [18], Targetscan 6.2 [19], miRanda [20], and
MicroCosm [21] were 90, 61, 109, and 28 respectively
(Figure 1B). Overall, there was very little concordance
(3-22%) between the predictive algorithms and our
experimental results. Of the four algorithms tested,
MicroCosm predicted the greatest number of miRNAs
uncovered in our screen.

miR-603 as an MGMT-regulating miRNA.
From the 103 miRNAs that suppressed MGMT
expression in vitro, we wanted to identify those that
regulate MGMT expression in glioblastomas. We reasoned
that these miRNAs should exhibit an inverse correlation
with MGMT expression level in MGMT promoter
unmethylated specimens [22]. In order to identify these
miRNA, we used the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas
(CGGA) database. We identified miRNAs with inverse
correlation coefficients comparable to miR-181d, a
previously identified MGMT-regulating miRNA (See
Methods). The 15 candidates that fulfilled this criterion
were further tested for their effects on MGMT expression
in LN340, an MGMT expressing glioblastoma cell line
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 2).
Previous reports suggest miR-221/mir-222 [23],
miR-767-3p, and miR-648 [24] as potential MGMT
regulating miRNAs in glioblastoma. However, miR-221,
miR-222 and miR-648 transfection did not consistently
suppressed MGMT expression in our screen. Moreover,
their expression did not inversely correlate with MGMT
expression (Supplemental Figure 3). In contrast, miR-7673p transfection suppressed MGMT expression (Figure
1C). Its expression level also inversely correlated with
MGMT mRNA expression.
Of the top 15 candidates identified by our screen,
miR-603 most strongly suppressed MGMT expression
in all cell lines tested. When miR-603 mimics were
transfected into A1207 cells, MGMT mRNA and protein
were suppressed by approximately 50% (Figure 1D,
E). To further confirm the MGMT suppressing effect of
miR-603, we established an LN340 cell line that stably
expressed miR-603 (see Methods). Independent clones of
miR-603 and empty vector containing lines were tested
by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) for MGMT
expression. In this stable expression model, miR-603
expression was consistently associated with approximately
6-fold decrease in MGMT mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 1F, G).
Emerging literature suggests that neurosphere
culturing conditions better simulate glioblastoma biology
than adherent lines [25]. Therefore, we used neurosphere
lines as a model system to confirm the suppression
of MGMT by miR-603. In BT99 neurosphere cells,
transfection of miR-603 mimics caused an approximately
3-fold decrease in MGMT protein expression (Figure 1

RESULTS
Identifying miRNAs that suppress MGMT
expression.
To identify miRNAs that suppressed MGMT
expression, we individually transfected 885 known
miRNAs (Human miScript miRNA mimic 96 set, Qiagen)
into T98G, a glioblastoma cell line that showed high
expression of MGMT. 48 hours after transfection, the
cells were assessed for viability by direct visual inspection
(Supplementary Figure 1). MGMT protein expression was
then measured by Western blotting (Figure 1A). miRNAs
that suppressed MGMT expression more than 50%
without significant cytotoxicity (>50% cell death) were
identified. A total of 103 miRNAs were identified in this
manner (Supplementary Table 1).
We first tested whether the identified miRNAs
coincided with those predicted to interact with the 3’UTR
of MGMT by differing algorithms. For this in silico
analysis, only miRNAs predicted with a total context
score of -0.25 or lower were considered. The number of

48 hours after transfection and MGMT expression was quantified by Western blotting [43]. (B) Comparing screen results with predictions of
computational algorithms. Predicted miRNAs that bind to the 3’UTR of MGMT were identified using four different algorithms (miRanda,
DIANA microTv3.0, Targetscan 6.2 and MicroCosm). Results were compared in a pairwise manner between algorithmic predictions
and our screen results. The set of miRNAs that overlapped between methods are shown as a fraction of the total number of predicted
miRNA shown to the left (under the column Total predictions).The overlap was greatest between MicroCosm and the screen result. (C)
Identification of potential MGMT regulating miRNAs. miRNAs that suppressed MGMT expression in the screen were tested to see whether
their expression inversely correlated with MGMT expression in MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastomas using the Chinese Glioma
Genome Atlas (CGGA). Candidates that exhibited inverse correlation commensurate with miR-181d, an established MGMT-regulating
miRNA [17] were selected for further characterization. These 15 miRNAs were transfected into LN340 glioblastoma cells. 48 hours after
transfection, MGMT silencing was assessed by Western blotting; α-tubulin was used as a loading control. Quantitative assessments of
MGMT expression are shown in the bottom panel. (D) qRT-PCR demonstrating MGMT silencing 72 hours after transfection of A1207

by qRT-PCR. (G) Western blotting confirmed that miR-603 expression suppressed MGMT expression. Independent clones of miR-603 and

H). Together, these data suggest that miR-603 suppressed
MGMT expression.

these manipulations result in non-physiologically high
concentrations of the miRNA, resulting in experimental
artifacts. In order to exclude this possibility, we identified
a glioblastoma line, LN18, which intrinsically expressed
miR-603 at a level 18-fold higher than other cell lines
tested (Figure 2A). We tested whether the neutralization of
miR-603 via antimiR transfection in this cell line increased

48 hours after biotinylated miR-603 or biotinylated non-targeting miRNA (30nM) was transfected into A1207 cells, cells were lysed and
treated with streptavidin coated magnetic beads. qRT-PCR was performed to determine the relative abundance of MGMT mRNA and
GAPDH mRNA (control). There was a significant enrichment of MGMT mRNA in the biotinylated miR-603 pull-down relative to the
non-targeting miRNA pull-down. (B) Predicted miR-603 binding sites (MREs) in 3’UTR of MGMT. MRE prediction was performed using

significant loss of luciferase activity. A1207 cells were seeded at a 5x105 cells per well. 24 hours after seeding, cells were transfected with
both miR-603 and the MGMT 3’UTR or non-targeting miRNA and the MGMT 3’UTR. The NOTCH 3’UTR was co-transfected with miR34a as a positive control. Luciferase activity was assessed 48 hours after co-transfection. (D) Mutation of miR-603 MRE in the MGMT
3’UTR abolished the suppressive effect of miR-603. Truncated versions of the MGMT 3’UTR were constructed and tested as above
described. Mutations of the first three MREs disrupted the luciferase suppressive effect of miR-603.

was assessed 14 days after transfection. Representative images of the survival assay are shown in the lower panel. (B) Stable expression of

effect of miR-603 was rescued by MGMT cDNA expression. A1207 cells were seeded at 5x105 cells per well. 24 hours after seeding, cells

MGMT silencing. When LN18 cells were transfected
with anti-miR-603, a 2.3-fold increase of MGMT protein
expression was observed (Figure 2B). This effect was not
observed when cells were transfected with a control antimiR. We recapitulated this result using LN340 lines stably
expressing miR-603. Transfection of these lines with antimiR-603 resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in
MGMT protein expression. This effect was not observed
with a control anti-miR or in LN340 lines transfected
with a vector control (Figure 2C). These results suggest
that physiologic levels of miR-603 modulate MGMT
expression.
We next determined whether miR-603 suppressed
MGMT expression in vivo. High MGMT expressing,
patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts (GBM12TMZ and
43TMZ) that were serially passaged in murine flank were
injected with miR-603 or non-targeting miRNA (4 tumors
per condition) [26]. 48 hours after injection, xenografts
were harvested, and MGMT expression was assessed by
IHC and Western blotting. GBM12TMZ injected with
miR-603 exhibited no detectable MGMT staining by IHC,
whereas intense MGMT staining was found in xenografts

injected with the control miRNA (Figure 2D). Western
blotting analysis showed that the miR-603 injected
xenograft exhibited an approximately 8-fold decrease
in MGMT expression relative to the control injected
xenograft (Figure 2E). Similar results were observed with
GBM43TMZ, suggesting that the introduction of miR-603
in vivo suppressed MGMT expression

Interaction between miR-603 and the MGMT
3’UTR.
We wished to determine whether miR-603
suppresses MGMT by direct interaction with the MGMT
3’ UTR [27]. For this purpose, 3’biotinylated miR-603
or non-targeting miRNA were transfected into A1207
glioblastoma cells as described previously [17]. mRNAbiotinylated miRNA complexes were pulled down using
streptavidin coated magnetic beads and bound MGMT
and GADPH mRNA were analyzed by quantitative RTPCR (Figure 3A). We detected a 15-fold enrichment of
MGMT in the biotinylated miR-603 pull-down relative

and miR-603 binding sites on MGMT 3’UTR. MRE prediction was performed by Targetscan 4.2. The miR-181d MREs were previously
published [17]. The first three miR-603 MREs are as shown in Figure 3D. (B) miR-603 and miR-181d cooperate to suppress MGMT
expression. A1207 cells were seeded at 5x105 cells per well. 24 hours after seeding, cells were transfected with miR-603 (25nM or 30 nM),
miR-181d (5nM, 30nM) or a combination of miR-603(25nM) and miR-181d (5nM). Non-targeting miRNA (30nM) was transfected as a
control. MGMT expression was assessed by Western blotting 72 hours after transfection. Quantitative assessment of MGMT expression is
shown on the right panel. (C) Cooperative binding of miR-603 and miR-181d to MGMT mRNA. Biotinylated miR-603 (15nM or 20nM)
or biotinylated miR-181d (5nM, 20nM) were transfected in A1207 cells. Biotinylated non-targeting miRNA (20nM) were transfected as
a control. 48 hours after transfection, cells were lysed and treated with streptavidin coated magnetic beads. An increase in MGMT mRNA
precipitation is seen with a combination of biotinylated miR-603 and biotinylated miR-181d. This effect is not observed with increasing
concentrations of either miRNA by itself. (D) An index of miR-181d and miR-603 more closely mirrors MGMT expression in glioblastoma
specimens than each individual miRNA. To avoid arbitrary cut offs, we examined MGMT expression in the specimens dichotomized by
the median expression of miR-181d, miR-603, or a combined index of miR-181d and miR-603. Student’s t-test was performed to assess
whether MGMT expression differed significantly between the miR-high and miR-low groups. P-values of the comparison are as shown.

to biotinylated non-targeting miRNA. A GAPDH mRNA
pull-down using a GAPDH miRNA was performed as a
positive control. The mRNAs that were pulled-down by
GAPDH miRNA were not enriched for MGMT. We also
did not detect any GAPDH mRNA in the miR-603 pulldown (data not shown).
Additionally, we identified 5 potential MREs
(miRNA Response Elements) for miR-603 in the
MGMT 3’UTR (Figure 3B). The luciferase activity of
a pSiCheck-2 reporter construct harboring the MGMT
3’UTR was reduced by 40% when co-transfected with
miR-603 relative to experiments where co-transfection
was performed using non-targeting miRNAs (Figure 3C).
Moreover, this suppressive effect was abolished when the
first three putative miR-603 MREs were mutated (Figure
3D). These results suggest that miR-603 modulates
MGMT expression via interaction with the MGMT
3’UTR.

to

miR-603 and 5nM miR-181d completely suppressed
MGMT expression. Of note, this complete suppression
was not achieved by 30nM of miR603 or 30nM of
miR-181d, suggesting cooperativity between these two
miRNAs in their interactions with MGMT (lanes 3, 5
versus 7).
We next tested whether this cooperativity occurred
at the level of mRNA interaction. To test this hypothesis,
we performed affinity pull-down experiments with a
combination of biotin tagged miR-181d and miR-603.
At 5nM concentration, biotinylated-miR-181d pull-down
showed a 2.4-fold enrichment in the level of MGMT
mRNA relative to a control-miR pull-down (Figure 5B). A
similar level of MGMT-mRNA enrichment was observed
with the miR-603 pull-down relative to the control miR
pull-down. Notably, when a mix of 5nM biotinylatedmiR-181d and 15nM biotinylated-miR-603 were used, the
pull-down showed a 22-fold enrichment in MGMT mRNA
relative to the control miR pull-down (Figure 5D). This
synergistic enrichment was not observed when pull-downs
were performed with 20nM of biotinylated-miR-181d or
20nM of biotinylated-miR-603. These results support a
model of cooperative binding between miR-603 and miR181d to the MGMT mRNA.
These results suggest that MGMT expression is
regulated by multiple miRNAs. This model predicts that a
combined index of miR-181d and miR-603 should better
predict MGMT expression levels than either miRNA
individually. MGMT, miR-181d and miR-603 levels were
characterized for 74 glioblastoma specimens from the
UCSD glioblastoma tumor bank by qRT-PCR; GAPDH
was characterized as a control. We divided the specimens
into 2 groups based on median miR-181d or miR-603
expression levels. For both miR-603 and miR-181d,
the difference in the MGMT expression levels between
the high versus low groups was statistically significant
(p=0.0028 and p=0.0253 respectively) (Figure 5D). A
combined index of miR-181d and miR-603 expression
levels captured the variation in MGMT expression better
than each individually. For the index, the difference in
MGMT expression between the high and low miRNA
samples was highly significant at p<0.0001. In aggregate,
the co-transfection studies, the biotin pull-down studies,
and the clinical specimen analysis support a model where
MGMT expression is regulated by miR-603 and miR181d.

temozolomide

Modulation of MGMT expression should translate
into altered temozolomide sensitivity [28]. We first
tested this prediction using transient transfection assays.
A1207 cells were transfected with miR-603 or nontargeting miRNA and then treated with temozolomide.
Cells transfected with miR-603 showed a 60% loss in
temozolomide resistance (Figure 4A) relative to cells
transfected with non-targeting miRNA. Additionally,
LN340 cells stably expressing miR-603 demonstrated a
near two order of magnitude increase in temozolomide
sensitivity relative to LN340 stably transfected with a
vector control (Figure 4B). Importantly, co-transfection
of MGMT cDNA (missing the 3’UTR of MGMT) with
miR-603 reversed the expression and temozolomide
sensitization effects of miR-603 on MGMT (Figure 4C
lane 5 versus 6 and Figure 4D). Expectedly, the MGMT
cDNA was not able to reverse the effect of an siRNA
targeting the coding sequence of MGMT (Figure 4C, lanes
7-8).

miR-603 cooperates with miR-181d to silence
MGMT.
Cooperative repressive effects have been
documented between different miRNAs with distinct
MRE sites on a target gene [29-32]. We wished to
determine if miR-181d and miR-603 (Figure 5A) exhibit
such an interaction [33, 34]. We titrated the amount of
miR-181d and miR-603 necessary to achieve the same
level of MGMT repression (lanes 4 and 6, Figure 5B).
The transfection of 5nM miR-181d suppressed MGMT
expression by 90%, while 25nM of miR-603 suppressed
MGMT by 78%. Co-transfection of LN340 with 25nM

DISCUSSION
Here, we present the first study to integrate a
genome-wide miRNA screen with an informatics screen
using genomic data derived from clinical specimens to
identify clinically pertinent MGMT-regulating miRNAs.
We previously demonstrated that MGMT is posttranscriptionally regulated by miRNAs, specifically miR181d [16, 17]. Through a screen that utilized MGMT
4033

expression from endogenous loci as an assay, we screened
for other miRNAs that suppressed MGMT expression. To
our surprise, nearly a fifth of transfected miRNAs directly
or indirectly modulated MGMT protein expression. We
then hybridized this dataset to identify the miRNAs whose
expression inversely correlated with the expression of
MGMT in MGMT promoter unmethylated glioblastomas.
This refined our list of miRNA candidates to fifteen.
This result suggests that most of the MGMT-regulating
miRNA identified in a cell-based assay are unlikely
to be pertinent and emphasize the need to integrate the
results of such screens with clinical genomic information.
We characterized one candidate in detail, miR-603, and
showed that it binds to the MGMT 3’UTR to downregulate MGMT. Importantly, miR-603 cooperated with
miR-181d to regulate MGMT expression. In clinical
specimens, a combined index of the two miRNA better
reflects MGMT expression than the expression of either
miRNA individually
Our near-exhaustive screen of MGMT regulating
miRNAs affords an opportunity to compare experimental
data with in silico prediction algorithms. While there are
several computational prediction algorithms available to
predict miRNA–mRNA interactions [18-21], the degree of
overlap of their individual predictions is poor [35, 36]. The
discrepant predictions between algorithms were again seen
when we analyzed the 3’UTR of MGMT. The predictions
that were most consistent with our results were generated
by MicroCosm, where 21% of the miRNAs that were
predicted to interact with MGMT 3’UTR also suppressed
MGMT expression. It is notable that many of the miRNAs
that suppress MGMT expression were not predicted to
bind to MGMT 3’UTR by any of the algorithms. Since
we had excluded miRNAs with significant cytotoxicity
from our analysis, this result suggests that a large number
of miRNAs can influence expression of a gene without
direct binding to the mRNA of that gene. For instance,
MGMT degradation is mediated through proteasomes
[37] and miRNAs that modulate proteasome function
may “indirectly” influence MGMT levels. As such, the
miRNA regulatory network for MGMT regulation may
be significantly more complex than models with focus on
miRNAs that bind to the target gene. While these results
were derived using MGMT as a model, the finding may
bear relevance to miRNA regulation of oncogenes or
tumor suppressors genes.
In addition to the complexity of indirect miRNA
regulators, our results further suggest that MGMT is
concordantly regulated by at least two miRNAs that bind
to its 3’UTR, miR-181d and miR-603. In general, stronger
miRNA- mediated repression of mRNA is observed when
there are multiple binding sites for the same miRNA on
a 3’UTR [29, 33]. Moreover, several recent reports have
demonstrated cooperative binding of different miRNAs on
the same 3’UTR [30, 34, 38]. This cooperativity requires
that the involved miRNA response elements (MREs) be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

placed 16-40 nucleotides apart in the 3’UTR [32, 34].
Consistent with these findings, three of the five binding
sites predicted for miR-603 on the MGMT 3’UTR are
located within 40bp of miR-181d MREs. The arrangement
of these MREs likely contributed to regulation of MGMT
by miR-603 and miR-181d.
Only approximately 10% of glioblastoma patients
derive durable benefit from temozolomide treatment
[39, 40]. However, temozolomide remains a standard
of care for all glioblastoma patients because there are
currently no reliable predictive biomarkers of response
[41]. As temozolomide is a mutagen, it is highly desirable
that patients who will not derive durable benefit be
excluded from this therapy [42]. While MGMT promoter
methylation status represents a significant advance in
this regard, a significant portion of MGMT promoter
unmethylated patients derive therapeutic benefit from
temozolomide. A contributing factor to the limitation
of MGMT promoter assays is the post-transcriptional
regulation of MGMT. For instance, an MGMT promoter
unmethylated glioblastoma may harbor low MGMT
expression as a result of high miR-181d or miR-603
expression. Therefore, an integrated platform which
incorporates MGMT promoter methylation with MGMTregulating miRNA expression may be able to better predict
temozolomide therapeutic response.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and stable cell lines
Human glioblastoma cell lines A1207, LN340,
LN18, LN428, LN382, LN464, U373, U87, LN443,
U138, U118, SF767, LN319, LN215, U343, LN229,
U178, LN235 and T98G were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator
and passaged with Trypsin. NHA were purchased
from ScienCell (Carlsbad, CA). NHA were passaged
using Astrocyte Medium from ScienCell. The BT99,
BT74, BT112, BT147, BT179, BT145 neurosphere
line was provided by Dr. Keith Ligon (Dana Farber
Cancer Institute). Neurosphere lines were cultured in
NeuroCult media (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada) supplemented with EGF, FGF and Heparin
per manufacturer’s instructions and grown at 37°C in a
5% CO2 incubator. Stable cell lines were established by
transfecting LN340 cells with the pCMV-miR-603 miRNA
expression vector or empty vector control (SC400580,
Origene, Rockville,MD). Stable cells were selected
using neomycin. Single clones were isolated and cultured
in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% PenicillinStreptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

T98G cells were seeded into 96 well plates at
1,000 cells per well in 80μl of medium. 24 hours after
seeding, cells were transfected with 885 Human miScript
miRNA mimics (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in 96 well
plates. Transfection was performed by the addition of a
transfection mix consisting of 15.5μl of Opti-MEM, 0.5μl
of Hiperfect (Qiagen), and 4μl of 2μM siRNA. 48 hours
after transfection, miRNA cytotoxicity was scored by
visual inspection under the microscope, Qiagen cell death
siRNA used as a positive control for comparison on each
96 well plate. miRNAs causing >50% reduction in cell
number were excluded from further consideration. Cell
extracts were prepared from the 96 plates as described
previously [43].

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1%
Triton-X 100, 20mM β-glycerophosphate and 1mM
p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride
supplemented with complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche, Madison, WI). The lysates were heated at 95oC
for 5 minutes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000rpm
for 10 minutes before immunoblotting analysis.
Immunoblotting was performed using MGMT antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, ab7045, 1:500). β-actin
(Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO, 01673088,1:4000) and
α-tubulin (Sigma, T9026, 1:4000) were used as loading
controls. Intensities of the protein bands were quantified
using ImageJ software [44].

Glioblastoma xenografts
All animal studies were performed in accordance
with the Animal Care and Use Rules at the University of
California San Diego. Primary glioblastoma xenograft
lines with a “GBM” prefix were kindly provided by Dr.
Jann Sarkaria at the Mayo Clinic. These tumor samples
were originally derived from patient surgical specimens
and serially passaged as subcutaneous xenograft tumors
[45]. GBM12TMZ and GBM43TMZ were derived from
GBM12 and GBM43 after in vivo treatment with TMZ.
In these two xenografts, a significant induction of MGMT
expression was observed after TMZ treatment [26]. GBM
xenograft tumors were established in the flank of 5 week
old nude mice as described previously [26]. Once solid
tumors reached 50mm3 in size, 25μl of miR-603 mimics
or non-targeting control miRNA were injected into the
tumor (4 tumors each). Each injection contained 250pmol
of mimics, and mice received two injections of miR-603
or non-targeting control miRNA 24 hours apart. 48 hours
after the final injection, mice were sacrificed and tumors
were prepared for histology or protein isolation.

Transfection of miRNA mimics and antimiRs
Cells were transfected using HiPerfect transfection
reagent (Qiagen) with miRNA mimics (miR-603:
MSY0003271, miR-181d: MSY0002821, Allstars
Negative control siRNA: 1027280 (Qiagen), MGMT
SMARTpool siRNA: M-008856-00-0005 (Dharmacon,
Pittsburgh, PA)) or antimiRs (Anti-miR-603:MIN0003271,
anti-miR-181d: MIN0002821, anti-miR-Control 1027271)
from Qiagen per manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA
and protein were extracted from cells after 72 hours and
analyzed by Western blotting or qRT-PCR.

Immunohistochemical staining

Real-time PCR analysis

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was carried
out on 4μm sections heated for 30 minutes at 60°C using
the Bond III fully automated staining system with their
Bond Polymer Refine detection system and associated
reagents supplied by Leica Microsystems (NewcastleUpon-Tyne, UK). Antigen retrieval and dilution was
performed at 100°C for 30 min with MGMT antibody

Total RNA was extracted from cells using miRNeasy
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
cDNA was synthesized using 0.5 µg of total RNA with
the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
or Exiqon cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon, Woburn, MA).

with previous reports, MGMT was considered positive
when uniform MGMT staining was detected in cell nuclei
[46]. 

miRNA with either pSi-Check-2-MGMT 3’UTR or empty
vector controls using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
per manufacturer’s instructions. The MGMT 3’UTR was
sectioned into three regions (7110bp, 215-274bp and
490-549bp) containing predicted miRNA binding sites
based on restriction site availability. These three regions
were cloned into pSiCheck-2 luciferase reporter vector.
Corresponding constructs with mutated MREs were also
cloned. All cloned sequences were verified by direct DNA

miRNA affinity tagged precipitation
40nM of 3’ biotinylated miR-603 or control miRNA
(cel-miR-67) (Thermo Scientific) was transfected into
A1207 glioblastoma cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax
(Invitrogen) as described previously [17]. GAPDH miRNA
was also transfected as a positive control to precipitate
GAPDH mRNA. 48 hours after transfection, cells were
lysed using Lysis Buffer: 700μl of 20mM Tris (pH7.5),
100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 50U
RNAseOUT (Invitrogen) and 1:50,000 Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation (10,000xg, 10
min), the supernatant was mixed with streptavidin-coated
magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 4 hours at
4°C. The beads were washed, and the bound mRNA was
extracted using the miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen) as pull-down.
cDNA was synthesized from the pull-down using MMLVRT (Epicenter Biotechnology, Madison, WI) and random
primers (Promega, Madison, WI). qRT-PCR was then
performed and the fold enrichment of MGMT transcript
in the pull-down was determined for both control miRNA
and miR-603.

Temozolomide sensitivity assays and rescue
experiments
Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1000 cells
per well. 24 hours after seeding, cells were transfected
with 30nM miR-603 or non-targeting miRNA. 24 hours
after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and
TMZ containing media was added. Clonogenic survival
was assessed 14 days after transfection.
A1207 cells were seeded at 5x105 cells per well.
24 hours after seeding, cells were co-transfected with
combinations of miR-603 mimic (60nM) + MGMT
cDNA or miR-603 mimic (60nM) + empty vector. The
MGMT cDNA vector was lacking the 3’UTR. Cells were
lysed 48 hours after transfection and assessed for MGMT
expression

Glioblastoma patient specimen and analysis

Clonogenic assay

All research performed was approved by IRB boards
at University of California, San Diego Human Research
Protections Program and was in accordance with the
principles expressed at the declaration at Helsinki. Each
patient was consented by a dedicated clinical research
specialist prior to collection. Written consent was obtained
for each patient. The consent process was approved by
the ethics committee, and all records were documented
in our electronic record system. The written consent
from patients was also scanned into our electronic record
system. All diagnoses of glioblastoma were histologically
confirmed. Glioblasotma specimens were further
characterized in terms of qRT-PCR for the expression
levels of miR-181d, miR-603, and MGMT. 18S rRNA,
GAPDH and Actin were used as reference genes, yielding
comparable results.

Cells were plated at a concentration of 500 cells
per well. The following day, cells were treated with
temozolomide or DMSO as a control. 14 days after
treatment, cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with acetic
acid: methanol (1:3) for 15 minutes and stained with
crystal violet; and the number of colonies formed per well
were counted. A colony is defined as having 50 or more
cells.

Reporter Assays and Cloning
The MGMT 3’UTR (1,001 bp) was amplified from
genomic DNA isolated from U87 glioblasoma cells and
cloned into pSiCheck-2 dual reporter vector (Promega).

Fas/caspase-8 independent. Cancer Res. 2000; 60(20):58155824.

In order to computationally determine all the
miRNAs that target MGMT, we used four of the leading
miRNA prediction algorithms: DIANA - microT v3.0
http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/microT/ [18, 47], miRanda
http://www.microrna.org/microrna/getGeneForm.do
[20, 48], MicroCosm http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/
microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5/ and Targetscan 6.2 http://
www.targetscan.org/ [19, 49]. TargetScan 4.2 was used
to identify predicted binding sites for miR-603 on the
MGMT 3’UTR.
The CGGA data set was kindly provided by Dr.
Tao Jiang (Department of Neurosurgery, Tiantan Medical
Center, Beijing, China) as normalized, probe-level
expression values. Values of probes designed to assess the
same gene were averaged. MGMT promoter methylation
status was determined as previously described [50].
The expression levels of MGMT mRNA and candidate
miRNAs were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation.
Candidate miRNAs that negatively correlated with MGMT
mRNA levels with Pearson’s correlations coefficients
greater than or equal to that observed for miR-181d (R2=
-0.2) were selected for further analysis.
MGMT mRNA expression, MGMT methylation,
and miRNA expression were downloaded from the TCGA
Data Portal (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) as level 3,
normalized data. Only patients with complete information
were included for the analysis (n = 214). MGMT
methylation status (probe cg12981137) was binarized
using the mean value as a cut –off. Patient with a score
lower than the mean were considered as unmethylated.
The expression levels of MGMT mRNA and candidate
miRNAs were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation.
Statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism Software version 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla,
CA). Data are presented as the means with their respective
standard errors (SEM). Student’s t test (two-tailed) was
used and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
