ABSTRACT
The thyroid hormone, 3,3′,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), regulates cell growth,
development and differentiation via interactions with thyroid hormone receptors (TR),
but the mechanisms underlying T3-mediated modulation of cancer progression are
currently unclear. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a tumor-associated protein, is overexpressed in
a variety of cancer types. Oligonucleotide microarray, coupled with proteomic analysis,
has revealed that LCN2 is positively regulated by T3/TR. However, the physiological
role and pathway of T3-mediated regulation of LCN2 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis
remain to be characterized. Upregulation of LCN2 after T3 stimulation was observed
in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, TRE on the LCN2 promoter
was identified at positions -1444/-1427. Overexpression of LCN2 enhanced tumor
cell migration and invasion, and conversely, its knockdown suppressed migration
and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. LCN2-induced migration occurred through
activation of the Met/FAK cascade. LCN2 was overexpressed in clinical hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) patients, compared with normal subjects, and positively correlated
with TRα levels. Both TRα and LCN2 showed similar expression patterns in relation to
survival rate, tumor grade, tumor stage and vascular invasion. Our findings collectively
support a potential role of T3/TR in cancer progression through regulation of LCN2
via the Met/FAK cascade. LCN2 may thus be effectively utilized as a novel marker
and therapeutic target in HCC.

palindromes (IPs). T3 is implicated as a potential tumor
inducer in several cancer types [3–5]. The T3/TR complex
promotes intestinal cell proliferation and intestinal
tumorigenesis via cooperation with the WNT pathway, and
induces β-catenin and some of its targets [6]. Additionally,
hyperthyroxinemia is reported to increase the rate of colon
cancer incidence in a rat experimental model [7]. The
findings to date collectively implicate a critical role of T3/
TR signaling in tumorigenesis.
Previous microarray analysis, coupled with
proteomic data, revealed the existence of a 25 kDa protein
regulated by T3, lipocalin 2 (LCN2), which belongs to the
lipocalin gene superfamily located at human chromosome
9q34. Members of the superfamily are composed of

INTRODUCTION
The thyroid hormone (TH) regulates cell growth,
development and differentiation by binding to thyroid
hormone receptors (TR), which belong to a superfamily
of nuclear receptors. Human TRs are encoded by TRα
and TRβ genes located on human chromosomes 17 and 3,
respectively [1]. These receptors function as liganddependent transcription factors that form heterodimers
with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and regulate target
genes via binding to thyroid hormone response elements
(TRE) located in their promoter regions [2]. In particular,
TRs bind to TREs in which half-sites are arranged as
palindromes (Pal), direct repeats (DR), and inverted

20 small secreted lipoproteins that interact with specific
ligands and share the same three-dimensional structure
in an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel surrounding
a central pocket. The most important domain of LCN2
is the central calyx, which is responsible for its activity
as a transporter of small hydrophobic substances, such
as prostaglandins, retinoids, arachidonic acid and fatty
acids [8]. LCN2 is currently one of the most interesting
and enigmatic proteins involved in the process of tumor
development [9].
Increased LCN2 expression has been described in
variety of cancers [10]. However, the specific functions
of LCN2 and mechanisms underlying its modulation
of cancer progression are not well characterized at
present. An association between LCN2 and tumor
invasion/metastasis is documented [11]. Recent studies
demonstrated that LCN2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and upregulation of MMP-9 in cancer
progression [12, 13]. LCN2 is a recognized target gene
of T3/TR signaling, which enhances cell metastasis [14].
However, the mechanistic pathway linking T3/TR with
LCN2 function in metastasis has not been characterized
as yet. Here, we focused on the role of LCN2 and the
mechanism underlying its regulation by T3/TR in a
hepatoma cell line. Based on the collective findings, we
propose that T3/TR promotes metastasis through LCN2
upregulation in HCC.

Total cell lysates and conditioned media were
prepared, and protein concentrations determined with
the Bradford assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL). Equivalent amounts of proteins were fractionated
on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide
gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane (pH 7.9, Amersham Biosciences Inc.,
Piscataway, NJ), blocked with 5% non-fat powdered
milk, incubated with specific primary antibodies at 4°C
overnight, and subsequently hybridized with the respective
secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated mouse/rabbit/goat
anti-IgG) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, immune
complexes were visualized using the chemiluminescence
method with an ECL detection kit (Amersham) on Fuji
X-ray film, as described previously [18].

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (q-RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from four T3-treated
HepG2 isogenic cell lines using TRIzol reagent, as
described previously [19]. Subsequently, cDNA was
synthesized via RT-PCR with the Superscript II kit (Life
Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). Real-time qRT-PCR
was performed on a 15 μl reaction mixture containing
750 nM forward and reverse primers, varying amounts
of template and 1 × SYBR Green reaction mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SYBR Green fluorescence
was determined using the ABI PRISM 7500 detection
system (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed
using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems).
Genes were normalized against the ribosomal binding
protein RiboL35A gene.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human hepatoma cells, HepG2, Huh7, SK-HEP1
and J7, were routinely cultured at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HepG2 and J7 cell lines
were stably transfected with TRα1 (HepG2-TRα1 and
J7-TRα1) or TRβ1 (HepG2-TRβ1). The vector control
cell line employed was HepG2-neo [15, 16] Huh7-LCN2
and SK-HEP1-LCN2 represent Huh7 and J7 cell lines
expressing LCN2, respectively. Serum was depleted of T3
(Td), as described previously [17].

Cloning and activities of LCN2 promoter
fragments
Fragments of the LCN2 promoter (positions -1524
to +98) were ligated into the pA3TK vector (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI) based on the published sequence.
Several serial deletion and mutant constructs of the LCN2
promoter were amplified via PCR and cloned into pA3TK.
Promoter sequences were confirmed using automated
DNA sequencing. HepG2-TRα1 cells treated with 10 nM
T3 for 24 h were cotransfected with 0.6 μg DNA/well of
pA3TK vector containing the LCN2 promoter sequence
and 0.3 μg of SVβ plasmid, a β-galactosidase expression
vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), in 24-well plates using
TurboFect in vitro transfection reagent (Fermentas, Glen
Burnie, MD) to determine the transcriptional activities
of TREs within the LCN2 promoter. At the end of the
treatment period, transfected and non-transfected cells
were lysed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase

Preparation of conditioned medium
HepG2-TRα1, HepG2-TRβ1, HepG2-neo, J7-TRα1,
Huh7-LCN2 and SK-HEP1-LCN2 cells were grown to
confluence in 10 cm cell culture dishes. Cells contacting
dishes were washed twice with PBS, subsequently
incubated in serum-free medium, and either treated with
T3 for 24 h or left untreated. At the end of the treatment
period, conditioned medium (CM) was collected and
concentrated using spin columns with a molecular mass
cut-off of 3 kDa (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Billerica, MA).

activities measured. Luciferase activity was normalized to
that of β-galactosidase, as described earlier [20].

Short hairpin RNA clones targeting LCN2 were
purchased from the National RNAi Core Facility (Institute
of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan).
Transfection of shRNA against the endogenous LCN2
gene in HepG2-TRα1 and J7 cells was transit performed
using Turbofect reagent (Invitrogen). LCN2 repression
was confirmed via Western blot analysis.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP assays were performed to examine the
interactions between TR and TRE on the LCN2 promoter
[18]. HepG2-TRα1 cells treated with 10 nM T3 for 24 h
or left untreated were harvested and cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature in DMEM.
Reactions were terminated with the addition of 0.125 M
glycine. Subsequently, cell lysates were washed three times
with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS and 0.1%
sodium deoxycholate) containing three protease inhibitors
(1 mM PMSF, aprotinin, and leupeptin). Cell lysates were
sonicated with a Misonix Sonicator 3000 Homogenizer
(Mandel Scientific Company Inc., Guelph, ON, Canada) to
disrupt chromatin. Sonicated DNA was between 200 and
1000 bp in length. Products were precleared with 60 μl
protein A/G agarose (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for
2 h at 4°C. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with antiTR (kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. S-Y Cheng
at the National Cancer Institute) and anti-IgG antibodies
(R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The 59 bp
LCN2 promoter fragment containing the predicted TRE
region was amplified via PCR with the forward primer,
5′- TCAGGTACCCGGCCTGGCAGAGGATAC- 3′,
and
reverse
primer,
5′-TCACTC
GAGCCCAGGAACTCCACCTCTG- 3′.

In vitro migration and invasion assays
The influence of LCN2 on the migration and
invasion abilities of Huh7-LCN2 and SK-HEP1LCN2 cells was determined with a rapid in vitro assay
(Transwell) (Falcon BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey)
[21]. Briefly, cell density was adjusted to 105 cells/ml, and
100 μl of the suspension seeded on either non-matrigelcoated (migration) or matrigel-coated (invasion) (BectonDickinson) upper chambers of the Transwell plate. For
both assays, the pore size of the upper chamber was
8  mm. The medium in the upper chamber was serumfree DMEM, while the lower chamber contained DMEM
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After
incubation for 24 h at 37°C, cells traversing the filter from
the upper to lower chamber were examined via crystal
violet staining and cell counting. Experiments were
performed at least three times.

Immunohistochemistry staining
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from
lungs of SCID mice were evaluated via hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry using
a polyclonal antibody against LCN2 (GeneTex, Inc, San
Antonio, Texas) after the avidin-biotin complex method,
as described previously. Positive staining of cancer cells
was identified as dark brown color indicative of LCN2
immunoreactivity.

Cloning of LCN2
Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed
using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
and Oligo (dT) to synthesize template cDNA. LCN2
cDNA was amplified via PCR with the forward primer,
5′-TCAGGTACCATGC CCCTAGGTCTCCTGTG- 3′,
and reverse primer, 5′-CTCCTCGAGTCAGCCGT
CGATACACTGGT- 3′, for 30 cycles at 95°C for 1 min,
58°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. The LCN2 open
reading frame was ligated into pcDNA 3.0 expression
vector, and the resulting construct sequenced to confirm
the presence of the gene.

Gelatin zymography
Supernatant fractions of J7-control and J7-LCN KD
cells cultured for 24 h were collected and concentrated
using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Merck
Millipore Ltd.). Equal amounts of proteins were separated
via 10% SDS-PAGE with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). The gel
was incubated in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,
10 mM CaCl2, and 1% NaN3) at 37ºC overnight, stained
with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 10% acetic
acid and 50% methanol for 30 min, and de-stained with
10% acetic acid and 20% methanol twice for 30 min.

Establishing Huh7 and SK-HEP1 cell lines stably
overexpressing LCN2
Huh7 and SK-HEP1 cell lines were transfected with
the LCN2 cDNA construct in 10 cm cell culture dishes
using Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h,
transfected cells were transferred to medium containing
G418 (400 μg/ml) for selection until the generation of a
single cell clone. Expression of LCN2 protein in Huh7
and SK-HEP1 cells was detected using Western blot
analysis.

of J7-TR cells [14]. Mice were divided into two groups,
specifically, Group A (euthyroid) comprising control mice
given normal drinking water and Group B (hyperthyroid)
administered drinking water augmented with T3 (2 mg/L)
(Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) after inoculation of
tumor cells. Mice were sacrificed about 1 month after
injection, their livers and lungs removed for tumor biopsy,
and the T3 and TSH levels determined. The T3 and TSH
levels in sera of euthyroid mice (Group A) were 45.5 ng/
dl and 0.246 mIU/ml, while those in sera of hyperthyroid
mice (Group B) were 619 ng/dl and 0.008 mIU/ml,
respectively. Tumor volume was calculated using the
following equation: length × height × width. Formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from SCID mice
were evaluated based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining and immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal
antibody against LCN2 (Epitomics). All procedures were
performed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.

expression in HepG2-Neo cells (Fig. 1B, C), suggesting
that LCN2 is stimulated by T3 in a receptor-dependent
manner.

T3 induces LCN2 transcription
The reporter assay was performed to identify
the position of the thyroid hormone response element
(TRE) to further clarify the regulatory effects of T3 on
LCN2 at the transcriptional level. The LCN2 5′-flanking
region encompassing nucleotides -1524/-98 (relative to
the transcription initiation site) with numerous predicted
putative TREs (Fig. 1D) was cloned and inserted upstream
of the luciferase reporter gene in pA3TK-luc containing a
minimum thymidine kinase promoter to generate Construct
p1. Serial deletion mutants were subsequently generated,
designated Constructs p2–5 (Fig. 1D). The transcriptional
activities of the LCN2 promoter fragments are illustrated in
Fig. 1D. Among these, only the p5 construct containing one
putative TRE was activated ~8-fold by T3 in HepG2-TRα1
cells. TREs in the p1 fragment were sequentially mutated
to yield p6 constructs. Upon mutation of the putative TRE
(IPs), the luciferase activity of p6 was completely abolished
(Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that T3 regulates LCN2
at the transcriptional level by binding to the putative TRE
site between positions -1456/-1398 (p5) encompassing
an IP-like sequence between positions -1444 and -1427
(GGATACTTTTTAAGGTCA).

Human HCC specimens
All samples of HCC tissues with paired adjacent
normal liver tissues for Western blot and q-RT-PCR
analyses were from the Taiwan Liver Cancer Network
(TLCN). The study protocol was approved by the Medical
Ethics and Human Clinical Trial Committee of the Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital (IRB No. 98–0798B).

TR proteins interact with TRE (positions -1444
to -1427) within the LCN2 promoter

RESULTS

To further determine whether LCN2 TRE (IPs)
is directly targeted by TR proteins, the ChIP assay was
performed. TR proteins were clearly associated with the
TRE region within the LCN2 promoter in vivo (Fig. 1E).
Notably, TRα1 was recruited to the TRE-binding site
whereas control IgG produced only background levels
(Fig. 1E). Furin TRE was used as the positive control
[15]. Accordingly, we propose that TRα1 protein binds the
LCN2 promoter for transcriptional regulation.

Effects of T3 on LCN2 mRNA and protein
expression

LCN2 is associated with cancer progression
in vitro and in vivo

Several isogenic HepG2 cell lines stably expressing
high levels of wild-type TRα1 and TRβ1 (HepG2-TRα1
and HepG2-TRβ1, respectively) were established.
Three HepG2 cell lines, HepG2-Neo, HepG2-TRα1 and
HepG2-TRβ1, expressing various levels of TR (Fig. 1A)
were used for analyses. Notably, LCN2 expression was
stimulated by T3 in HepG2-TRα1 and HepG2-TRβ1
cell lines at both the mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein
levels (Fig. 1C) in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
In contrast, T3 had a marginal or no effect on LCN2

LCN2 expression was identified in five hepatoma
cell lines (Fig. 2A). To determine the specific function
of LCN2, control cell lines Huh7-V#1 and V#2
(Fig.  2B) or SK-HEP1-V#1 and V#2 (Fig. 2D) and
those overexpressing LCN2, Huh7-L#1 and L#2
(Fig. 2B) or SK-HEP1-L#1 and L#2 (Fig. 2D), were
established. Notably, Huh7 cell lines overexpressing
LCN2 displayed significantly increased (~4 to 5-fold)
migration and (~3 to 4-fold) invasion, compared with
control cells (Fig. 2C). Similarly, we observed markedly

To verify whether the in vitro effect of LCN2 can
be replicated in vivo, SCID mice were injected with

effect on cell growth (data not shown).

from H&E staining and IHC analyses (Fig. 3B), respectively.
Thus, LCN2 appears to promote cell migration and invasion
in SK-HEP1 hepatoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo.

nodules, determined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. Higher T3 levels (hyperthyroid conditions)
led to enhanced LCN2 expression and number of lung
foci, as evident from H&E staining and IHC (Fig. 3D,
S3A and S5). LCN2 expression in metastatic lung foci
of hyperthyroid mice was obviously higher than that in
euthyroid mice (normal T3 levels). Moreover, we observed
T3-induced cancer cell invasion and LCN2 expression
in vivo, supporting the theory that T3 influences tumor
motility via LCN2 regulation.

LCN2 is associated with EMT, and promotes
cancer cell migration [11]. The proto-oncogene c-Met
is a key regulator of EMT-induced cell migration and
invasion [22]. Earlier, Chen et al. [23] demonstrated
that cellular migration is mediated downstream of
c-Met through its phosphorylation of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK). Accordingly, we examined whether the
Met/FAK activation pathway is implicated in ­­LCN2induced phenotypes. Marked upregulation of p-Met
and p-FAK was observed in LCN2-overexpressing
cells (Huh7-LCN2, L#1 and L#2 ; SK-HEP1-LCN2,
L#1 and L#2), compared with control cells (Huh7control, V#1 and V#2; SK-HEP1-control, V#1 and V#2)
(Fig. 5A). Furthermore, after depletion of LCN2 in J7,
p-Met and p-FAK protein levels, MMP-9 and MMP-2
activities were decreased, compared with control cells
(Fig. 5B, C). Further examination of whether the LCN2mediated mechanism occurs in T3-regulated hepatoma
cells revealed upregulation of p-Met and p-FAK after
T3 stimulation in HepG2-TRα1 cells (Fig. S1). Based on
the collective findings, we conclude that stimulation of
p-Met and p-FAK by T3 in HepG2-TRα1 cells is mediated
via LCN2.

LCN2 depletion suppresses cancer progression
in vitro and in vivo
To determine the consequences of LCN2 depletion,
control cell lines J7-Luc (Fig. 4A, left panel) or HepG2TRα1-Luc (Fig. 4B, left panel) and LCN2 knockdown
lines, J7-KD#1 and KD#2 (Fig. 4A) or HepG2-TRα1LCN2-KD (Fig. 4B) were established. Data from the
transwell assay showed that after depletion of LCN2
in J7 or HepG2-TRα1 cells, migration abilities were
decreased, compared with those of control cells (Fig.
4A, B, middle panel), confirming the ability of LCN2
to accelerate tumor cell migration in vitro. LCN2
expression in control cells was induced by T3 to further
confirm the thyroid hormone effect. Induction of
expression was abolished in HepG2-TRα1-LCN2-KD
cells (Fig. 4B, middle panel). Moreover, the migration
ability of HepG2-TRα1-control cells was markedly
enhanced following T3 stimulation, but attenuated in
HepG2-TRα1-LCN2-KD cells (Fig. 4B, middle panel).
Notably, migration was minimally restored in the
HepG2-TRα1-LCN2-KD-T3 cell line after T3 treatment,
compared to the LCN2-silenced HepG2-TRα1-LCN2KD cell line. Migration was blocked by ~80% in HepG2TRα1-LCN2-KD cells treated with T3, compared with
HepG2-TRα1-control cells (Fig. 4B, middle and right
panels). Treatment with a LCN2-neutralizing antibody
additionally induced a significant decrease in migration
(~3-fold) in Huh7-LCN2, but not control cells (Fig.
4C). Taken together, the data indicate that the migration
phenotype in the T3-treated hepatoma cells can be
restored in LCN2-KD conditions, but attenuated by a
LCN2-neutralizing antibody.
To investigate the effects of LCN2 depletion
in vivo, SCID mice were injected with J7-LCN2-KD
(LCN2-pooled KD stable clone) and J7-control ­(Lucpooled stable clone) cells. Mice administered J7-LCN2KD cells displayed significantly reduced numbers of lung
foci (Fig. 4D, upper panel), compared to those injected
with control cells, as evident from H&E staining results
(Fig. 4D, middle panel). Accordingly, we conclude that
LCN2 depletion reduces migration and invasion in J7
hepatoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo.

LCN2 is upregulated in human HCC
The clinicopathologic significance of LCN2 in
HCC and its correlation with TR were evaluated. LCN2
levels were analyzed in 80 consecutive HCC patients
using qRT-PCR. Among the 80 HCC sample pairs,
LCN2 was overexpressed in 71.3% (57 of 80) cancerous
tissues, compared with matched noncancerous tissues,
and TRα levels elevated by about 76.3% (61 of 80) in
cancerous tissues. High TRα and LCN2 levels were
commonly observed in patients with poor survival rates
(Fig. 6A, left and middle panels). Linear regression
analysis further revealed a significant positive correlation
between LCN2 and TRα1 levels, based on the T/N ratio
(Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.3399, P = 0.002)
(Fig. 6A, right panel). In contrast, no significant
correlation between LCN2 and TRβ1 levels was evident
(data not shown). We examined LCN2 and TRα1

the transcriptional level, and TR proteins directly bind
TRE between positions -1444 and -1427 of the LCN2
5′-flanking region. Notably, cell lines overexpressing
LCN2 showed higher migration and invasion abilities,
both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, T3-mediated
regulation of LCN2 occurred via the Met/FAK cascade
and suppression of E-cadherin, leading to cancer cell
progression. The potential mechanism of LCN2-induced
EMT has been addressed (Fig. S4). According to
previous findings, integrin α5β1 acts upstream of c-Met
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and promotes c-Met activation [24]. Here, we observed
that overexpression of LCN2 induces upregulation of
integrin α5β1, leading to the hypothesis that LCN2
activates c-Met/FAK through the integrin α5β1 pathway.
In our experiments, c-Met/FAK was downregulated in
integrin α5β1-depleted cells, compared with control cells
(Fig. S4A). Moreover, EMT markers, slug and MMP9,
displayed similar repression patterns after integrin α5β1
depletion. To further address whether slug and MMP9
act downstream of c-Met, experiments were performed

with c-Met knockdown cell lines. Notably, slug and
MMP9 levels were downregulated in c-Met-depleted
cells, compared with control cells (Fig. S4B). The results
collectively indicate that LCN2 induces EMT through the
integrin α5β1/c-Met/FAK pathway (Fig. S3B).

marker (E-cadherin) and increased expression of
mesenchymal markers (vimentin, fibronectin and MMPs)
that contribute to invasiveness [12, 13], which accounts
for their roles in enhancing tumor cell motility for
metastasis. In breast cancer, LCN2 is upregulated by the
HER2/ PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Conversely, decrease
in LCN2 expression significantly reduces the invasion

and migration abilities of HER2-positive breast cancer
cells [25]. LCN2 has been shown to regulate the HIF1α/VEGF cascade through Erk activation and enhance
angiogenesis in the aggressive MDA-MB-231 cell line
[26]. Knockdown of LCN2 suppresses the invasion of
prostate cancer cells through downregulation of MMP2 and MMP-9 [27]. Moreover, LCN2 is overexpressed
in the intestine in colitis patients and acts as a negative
prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer. However, several
studies reported that LCN2 suppressed cell migration and
invasion in colon cancer and in Ras-transformed mouse
mammary cells [28]. LCN2 was also demonstrated to
inhibit invasion and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer
[29]. In Wang’s study [30], LCN2 negatively modulated
the HCC cells through an EGF (or TGF-β1)/LCN2/Twist1
pathway. According to their clinical data, 62.5% (25 of 40)
HCC specimens expressed higher levels of LCN2 mRNA
than adjacent nontumor liver tissue samples. Levels of
LCN2 mRNA and protein significantly increased in the
differentiation status of HCCs. Immunohistochemical
staining in their cohort of patients demonstrated that
LCN2 expression also increased in various tumor
stages. Their results suggested that LCN2 expression is
significantly correlated with a worse differentiation grade,
but negatively correlated with twist1 in HCC. Collectively,
LCN2 showed the similar expression pattern at HCC
specimens in our results, but the regulation pathway
and cell type are different. In our study, overexpression
of LCN2 led to suppression of E-cadherin and increase
in p-Met and p-FAK protein levels, while its depletion
rescued E-cadherin and suppressed p-Met and p-FAK
protein levels as well as MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities.
E-cadherin is a transmembrane protein that
participates in rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and cellcell junctions in cancer cell progression [31]. E-cadherin
overexpression attenuates tumor cell migration and
metastasis [32, 33]. In view of our finding that expression
of E-cadherin is decreased in LCN2-overexpressing cells,
compared with controls, and conversely rescued in LCN2depleted cells, we propose that LCN2 accelerates tumor cell
migration through alterations in E-cadherin expression.
c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds and
interacts with its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
to activate different cellular signaling pathways, including
proliferation, motility, migration and invasion [34]. Cell
migration is mediated downstream of c-Met through
phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which
is localized to cellular adhesion complexes. A  recent
study demonstrated that Met-FAK interactions are a
critical determinant for tumor cells to acquire invasive
potential [23]. Our study disclosed that phosphorylation of
c-Met (Y1349) and FAK (Y397) is increased in LCN2overexpressing cells, compared with controls. Conversely,
phosphorylation is decreased in LCN2-depleted cells.
Notably, however, HGF mRNA and protein levels were
not significantly changed upon LCN2 overexpression or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

knockdown (data not shown). These findings indicate
that LCN2 promotes c-Met, but not a ligand-dependent
activation pathway. We propose that LCN2 regulates tumor
cell migration through activation of the Met/FAK cascade.
The thyroid hormone is a critical regulator of
diverse cell functions. TH participates in cell proliferation,
metabolism, organ development and muscle control in
a normal physiological environment [35, 36]. T3/TR
stimulates or inhibits the expression of suppressor genesDKK4 [37] or oncogenes-PTTG1 [16], respectively in
a subset of HCC specimens. During cancer progression,
T3/TR may play dual roles to promote or suppress cancer
cells in a certain genetic background, similar to the TGFβpathway [33]. Specifically, in benign tumors or earlystage cancer, T3/TR may inhibit cancer cell proliferation,
but promote cancer cell migration and invasion in
malignant tumors or late-stage cancer. Recent studies
indicate that T3/TR signaling upregulates proteases, such
as cathepsin H (CTSH) [38]. and brain-specific serine
protease 4 (BSSP4) [39] for ECM cleavage, and promotes
cancer metastasis, supporting a potential oncogenic role.
However, the function of T3/TR signaling in tumorigenesis
cannot be prematurely established from a single gene
study, and “the whole genome T3 effect” must be
considered. Establishing the effect of T3/TR on an animal
model is a plausible means to define its role in cancer.
Since TR actions are complex, tissue- and time-specific
aberrant expression patterns of various TR isoforms
have different effects and are associated with different
tumor types or stages of development. T3 signaling and
its interactions with other coregulators may facilitate the
switch from tumor suppression in the premalignant stages
of tumorigenesis to promotion in later stages of liver
cancer, leading to metastasis. Further studies are necessary
to determine what conditions that TRs might act as a
tumor suppressor and in what other conditions, TRs could
play as an oncogene. Data from our current study showed
that T3/TR modulates LCN2, a cancer-associated protein,
to promote cancer progression.
In conclusion, LCN2 enhances migration and
invasion abilities in HCC cell lines, both in vitro and
in vivo. T3-regulated LCN2 may play a role in hepatoma
cell motility through activation of the Met/FAK cascade to
promote metastasis.
