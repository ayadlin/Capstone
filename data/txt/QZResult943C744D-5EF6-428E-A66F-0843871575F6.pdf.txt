Abstract
Endocrine therapy is well established for the treatment of
breast cancer, and antiangiogenic agents are showing considerable promise. Targeting the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways
concomitantly may provide enhanced therapeutic benefit in
ER-positive breast cancer. Therefore, the effects of the VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584
(PTK/ZK) were investigated using human breast cancer cell
lines engineered to express aromatase. As expected in this
system, estrogen (E2) or androstenedione induced a proliferative response and increased ER-mediated transcription in
ER-positive cell lines expressing aromatase. However, surprisingly, in the presence of androstenedione, PTK/ZK suppressed
both the androstenedione-stimulated proliferation and ERmediated transcription. PTK/ZK alone and in the presence of
E2 had no observable effect on proliferation or ER-mediated
transcription. These effects result from PTK/ZK having
previously unrecognized antiaromatase activity and PTK/ZK
being a competitive aromatase inhibitor. Computer-assisted
molecular modeling showed that PTK/ZK could potentially
bind directly to aromatase. The demonstration that PTK/ZK
inhibits aromatase and VEGFR indicates that agents crossinhibiting two important classes of targets in breast cancer
could be developed. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4716–23]

Introduction
Over 70% of breast carcinomas express the estrogen receptor
(ER) and require estrogen stimulation for their growth. Treatment
with tamoxifen, which blocks ER, has made a substantial
contribution to the dramatic decrease in the mortality from breast
cancer in western countries over the last two decades. More
recently, clinical trials have shown that aromatase inhibitors that
block estrogen production have superior efficacy to tamoxifen;
significant increases in disease-free survival were seen with the
third-generation aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, and
exemestane (1–4). However, a substantial proportion of women
with ER-positive breast cancer becomes resistant to endocrine
treatment. Therefore, it has been suggested that combining
aromatase inhibitors with agents targeting other key biochemical

pathways required for tumor viability may further improve breast
cancer survival (5, 6).
There is extensive evidence supporting the role of angiogenesis,
the formation of new blood vessels, in breast cancer development,
invasion, and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) is a critical regulator of angiogenesis, and VEGF actions
are mediated by binding to the VEGF receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1)
and KDR (VEGFR-2). The combination of targeted antiangiogenic
therapy with conventional treatment is an attractive strategy in
breast cancer (7), as malignant cells are targeted directly, as well as
indirectly, through neovascularization driven by the stroma. In
addition, antiangiogenic agents reduce tumor interstitial pressure
and normalize the vasculature, and this may improve the delivery
of systemic therapy. Resistance to hormonal therapies in breast
cancer remains a significant treatment challenge (5, 8). The VEGF
pathway has been implicated in this process (9), and this has led to
the hypothesis that concomitantly targeting the VEGF and ER
signaling pathways may provide enhanced therapeutic benefit.
Targeting VEGFR with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in breast
cancer has significant potential (7). PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK)
was developed as a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFR-2 and
VEGFR-1 (10) and is undergoing clinical evaluation for the
treatment of breast and other cancers. Although, TKIs commonly
have additional activity against other tyrosine kinases, inhibitory
activity across other classes of drug targets has not been
documented. Here, we show that the PTK/ZK, a VEGFR TKI, also
significantly inhibits aromatase. This ‘‘multitargeting’’ activity could
potentially contribute to the antitumor effect of PTK/ZK. The
ability of a single small molecule inhibitor to inhibit two distinct
biological and biochemical pathways may allow the rational
development of agents designed to inhibit cross-class targets.

Materials and Methods
Materials. 17h-Estradiol (E2) and androstenedione were from Sigma.
[1-3H]4-Androstene-3,17-dione was from NEN Radiochemicals. Letrozole
and PTK/ZK (Supplementary Fig. S1) were synthesized by Novartis Pharma
AG and stored at 20jC as 10 mmol/L stocks in 100% ethanol or DMSO,
respectively. Sorafenib was provided by R. Marais, and imatinib was from
LKT Laboratories. Chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were of molecular
grade and purchased from Sigma. Tissue culture grade plastics were
purchased from Nunc.
Tissue culture. ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 [ER+/
HER2 ] and BT474 [ER+/HER2+], together with the ER-negative cell line
SKBR3 [ER /HER2+], were stably transduced with a retroviral construct
pBabeAROM expressing full-length human aromatase (CYP19). Clones
expressing clinically relevant levels of aromatase activity were selected
(MCF7 AROM 2A, BT474 AROM, and SKBR3 AROM). Target cell lines were
also transduced with the pBabeneo backbone (MCF7neo, BT474neo, and
SKBR3neo). MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells, which have a high level of
aromatase activity, were generated by stable transfection of CYP19 under

control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3AROM), as previously
described (11), or the pcDNA3 backbone (MCF7/pcDNA3) [AROM /ER+].
All cell lines were cultured in phenol red RPMI medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 10 Ag/mL insulin, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1 mg/mL
G418. Steroid-depleted medium, called DCC-FBS medium, was composed of
the phenol red RPMI medium containing 10% dextran charcoal–stripped
FBS, 10 Ag/mL insulin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine. The characteristics of the
cell lines are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell proliferation assays. Cell lines were depleted of steroids for 3 d
(12), seeded into 12-well plates at 1 to 4  104 per well, and allowed to
acclimatize for 24 h before treatment with drug combinations indicated for
6 d with daily changes. Cell number was determined using a Z1 Coulter
Counter (Beckman Coulter). Results were confirmed in a minimum of three
independent experiments, and each experiment was performed in triplicate.
Transcriptional assays. Cell lines (previously stripped of steroids for
3 d) were seeded in 24-well plates at 7  104 per well in steroid-depleted
(DCC) medium and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) with 0.1 Ag ERE
luciferase reporter construct (EREIItkluc) and pCH110 (h-galactosidase for
normalizing luciferase data). Cells were treated for 24 h, with the
concentration of the relevant drugs indicated. h-Galactosidase (GalactoStar, PE Biosystems) and luciferase (Promega) activity were measured using
a luminometer (TD20/20). Normalized luciferase activity from triplicate
wells was expressed relative to vehicle-treated control. Results were
confirmed in a minimum of three independent experiments, and each
experiment was performed in triplicate.
Aromatase assays. Aromatase inhibition assays were performed using
MCF7 AROM 1 cells (‘‘in-cell’’ assay), microsomes isolated from MCF7
AROM 1 cells, and human placental microsomes. Aromatase activities were
determined by the standard tritiated water release method (13) with
[1-3H]4-androstene-3,17-dione as substrate, as previously described (14).
Protein concentrations were quantified by the Bradford method (15).
Aromatase activity was calculated in picomoles of tritiated water released
per hour per milligram of protein (pmol/hr/mg protein). The aromatase
activity of untreated microsomes or cells in the absence of test drug was
set at 1.
Kinetic analysis. For the determination of K i values, placental microsomes were tested and incubations were performed at 37jC using
increasing concentrations of [1h-3H]-androstenedione, excess NADPH
(0.24 mmol/L), 20 Ag protein, and phosphate buffer (0.05 mol/L, pH 7.4).
The PTK/ZK concentration was 600 nmol/L. The reaction was started by
the addition of protein and stopped after 20 min by the addition of
dichloromethane. An aliquot (0.5 mL) of the aqueous phase was removed
and placed in a tube to which 1 mL 5% charcoal suspension was added, and
the tubes were shaken for 15 min at room temperature. The tubes were
centrifuged at 3,000  g for 10 min. Aliquots (0.5 mL) were added to 10 mL
of scintillation fluid (Quicksafe A, Zinsser Analytic) and counted in a liquid
scintillation counter (LS 6500, Beckman Coulter). For calculation of K i and
K m values, results were plotted in a double reciprocal Lineweaver Burk plot
[1/product (1/pmol/h/mg protein  103) versus 1/substrate (1/nmol/L 
103)], wherein the x-axis intercept corresponds to 1/K m (in the absence of
inhibitor) or 1/K m’ (in the presence of inhibitor).
Computer modeling. A homology model of aromatase (CYP19A_Human) was created based on the crystal structure of human cytochrome P450
CYP3A4 enzyme (PDB code 1W0G) as a template. Modeling was done
within the Quantatm and Insightth programs. Docking was carried out using
the genetic algorithm program GOLD (16). To dock PTK/ZK, a binding
cavity of up to 10 Å within aromatase was generated around the coordinates
of C10 atom of metyrapone. The docked PTK/ZK structure was then
subjected to molecular dynamic simulation within YASARA. During the
simulations, the heme was constrained but the protein and PTK/ZK were
allowed free movement.
The pharmacophore model for aromatase inhibition is previously
described (17). In the pharmacophore model, the most potent azole and
steroid inhibitors of aromatase are aligned using the heme group of the
enzyme as the reference anchoring point. Close analogues of the potent
inhibitors devoid of aromatase inhibitory activity are also included in the
model, allowing the definition of the volumes accessible and nonaccessible

to ligands in the active site of the enzyme. PTK/ZK, in a low energy
conformation, was positioned in the model using its pyridine moiety to
chelate the iron atom of the heme group while trying to fit the rest of the
molecule in the space occupied by the active molecules defining the volume
accessible to ligands.
Statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple
comparison test was performed to determine statistical significance.
A P value of <0.01 was considered statistically significant.

with the VEGFR inhibitor PTK/ZK, we required ER-positive,
aromatase-transfected cell lines. The previously described ERpositive, aromatase-transfected cell lines MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/
ER+] cells (11), MCF7 AROM 2A [AROM+/ER+], and BT474 AROM
[AROM+/ER+/HER2+] and ER-negative SKBR3 AROM [AROM+/
ER ] cells were used. In this system, aromatase converts the
substrate androstenedione to estradiol, the growth signal for ERpositive cells and this process is inhibited by aromatase inhibitors.
Increasing doses of 17h-estradiol (E2) stimulated growth in both
MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells and MCF7 cells transfected
with the empty vector MCF7/pcDNA3 [AROM /ER+] (Fig. 1A).
These results were expected as the MCF7-derived cell lines are ER
positive. Increasing concentrations of E2 failed to induce
proliferation in the ER-negative SKBR3 AROM [AROM+/ER ] cells
(Fig. 1A), confirming that ER is necessary to mediate the effects of
E2. Treatment with androstenedione also caused a dose-dependent
increase in cell number compared with untreated MCF7 AROM 1
[AROM /ER+] cells; androstenedione at 10 nmol/L stimulated
growth of f12-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, unlike E2, androstenedione treatment did not increase
proliferation of the MCF7/pcDNA3 [AROM /ER+] cells. The ability
of androstenedione to increase proliferation of MCF7 AROM 1
[AROM+/ER+] cells was consistent with its metabolic conversion
into estrogens by the cells. The failure of androstenedione to
stimulate proliferation in the MCF7/pcDNA3 [AROM /ER+] cells

suggests that aromatase activity is required for androstenedionestimulated proliferation. This was confirmed by the inhibition of
androstenedione-stimulated proliferation of MCF7 AROM 1
[AROM+/ER+] cells by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Almost
60% suppression of androstenedione-stimulated proliferation was
achieved with 100 nmol/L letrozole (Fig. 1C). To investigate
whether this was a general phenomenon of ER-positive breast
cancer cells, these results were confirmed in MCF7 AROM 2A cells
[AROM+/ER+] and another ER-positive cell line, BT474-aromatase–
transfected cells (BT474 AROM [AROM+/ER+/HER2+]; data not
shown). Furthermore, androstenedione treatment did not lead to
proliferation in SKBR3 AROM [AROM+/ER ] cells, suggesting that
both aromatase and ER are required to mediate androstenedionestimulated effects.
Having validated the cell lines to be used, we then investigated
whether PTK/ZK could affect the proliferation of ER-positive
breast cancer cells. In view of the lack of vasculature and
microenvironment in this in vitro model, PTK/ZK was not expected
to affect proliferation. MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells were
cultured in steroid depleted media (DCC) and subsequently treated
over 6 days with 10, 100, and 1,000 nmol/L of PTK/ZK alone and in
combination with a standard dose of androstenedione (10 nmol/L).
As expected, treatment with androstenedione resulted in an
increase (12-fold) in proliferation compared with untreated cells.
Unexpectedly, however, increasing doses of PTK/ZK inhibited cell

proliferation with a dose of 1,000 nmol/L, resulting in a 43%
decrease (P < 0.0001). However, PTK/ZK in the absence of
androstenedione had no effect on proliferation (P = 0.72;
Fig. 2A). No effects of PTK/ZK were seen in MCF7/pcDNA3
[AROM /ER+] cells, either in the presence or absence of androstenedione (Fig. 2B). The reduction in androstenedione-stimulated
proliferation was confirmed in BT474 AROM [AROM+/ER+HER2+]
cells (Fig. 2C) and MCF7 AROM 2A [AROM+/ER+] cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, no effects were seen either in the
presence or absence of androstenedione in ER-negative SKBR3
AROM [AROM+/ER ] cells (Fig. 2D). This suggested that the
antiproliferative effects observed with PTK/ZK in the presence of
androstenedione might be associated with the expression of ER
and/or aromatase.
PTK/ZK inhibits ER-mediated transcription in MCF7 AROM
cells. To investigate the mechanism of the inhibition of cell
proliferation by PTK/ZK, we first assessed whether the effects of
PTK/ZK involved an ER-mediated mechanism. Therefore, an
estrogen response element (ERE)–linked luciferase reporter construct was transfected in the MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells and
the effects of various treatments on luciferase activity measured.
Androstenedione (10 nmol/L) increased ER transcriptional activity
at 12-fold compared with untreated cells, and PTK/ZK, in the
presence of androstenedione, abrogated this effect. PTK/ZK
decreased ER/ERE transactivation in MCF7 AROM cells in a dosedependent manner; 1 Amol/L reduced activity by 76% (P < 0.0001).
Consistent with the effects on proliferation, PTK/ZK had no affect
on ER/ERE transactivation in the absence of androstenedione (P =
0.72; Fig. 3A). These results suggest that PTK/ZK affects ERmediated transcription only in the presence of androstenedione.
The effects of PTK/ZK on ER-mediated transcription were
confirmed in BT474 AROM [AROM+/ER+/HER2+] cells (Fig. 3B)
and MCF7 AROM 2A [AROM+/ER+] cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
PTK/ZK has no effect on estradiol-stimulated MCF7 AROM
cells. We speculated that the unexpected effects of PTK/ZK on
proliferation in the androstenedione-stimulated cells could be due
to antiaromatase activity. To assess this, we provided E2 directly to
the cells, thereby negating the requirement for aromatase activity
in MCF7 AROM [AROM+/ER+] cells, and investigated whether
PTK/ZK maintained inhibitory effects in this situation. Proliferative responses to increasing doses of PTK/ZK (10, 100, and 1,000
nmol/L), in combination with 1 nmol/L E2, were assessed in
MCF7AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells. As expected, E2 treatment
caused an increase in proliferation (f20-fold) compared with
untreated cells. In contrast to the effects seen in the presence of
androstenedione, PTK/ZK had no effect on cell proliferation at a
concentration of up to 1 Amol/L (P = 0.81; Fig. 4A). As anticipated,
in the presence of E2, PTK/ZK had no effect in MCF7/pcDNA3
[AROM /ER+] cells (Fig. 4B) or SKBR3 AROM [AROM+/ER ] cells
(Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effects of PTK/ZK in the presence of
androstenedione, but not estradiol, were confirmed in BT474
AROM [AROM+/ER+/HER2+] cells (Fig. 4D) and MCF7 AROM 2A
[AROM+/ER+] cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similarly, no
inhibitory effect of PTK/ZK was noted in the presence of E2 in
ERE transactivation studies (Fig. 5A and B). These findings
suggested that aromatase function was necessary for the
antiproliferative action of PTK/ZK.
PTK/ZK is an aromatase inhibitor. To confirm the antiaromatase activity of PTK/ZK, tritiated H2O assays monitoring
aromatase activity were carried out in MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/
ER+] cells. As expected, letrozole suppressed aromatase activity.

Figure 3. PTK/ZK inhibits the ER/ERE-mediated transactivation of aromatase
expressing ER+ cells. To assess the effect of PTK/ZK on ER/ERE transactivation
MCF7 AROM 1 [AROM+/ER+] cells (A ) and BT474 AROM [AROM+/ER+/
HER2+] cells (B) were transiently transfected with an ERE-linked luciferase
reporter construct followed by 24 h of treatment with vehicle (0.01% v/v ethanol),
androstenedione (10 nmol/L), or estradiol (1 nmol/L) and increasing
concentrations of PTK/ZK. Luciferase activity was normalized by h-galactosidase
from cotransfected pCH110. Normalized luciferase activity from quadruplicate
wells was expressed relative to the vehicle-treated control. Bar, SE. Effects were
confirmed in three independent experiments. *, P < 0.01 compared with controls.

Assessment of enzyme activity using both an ‘‘in-cell’’ assay (data
not shown) and microsomes isolated from MCF7 AROM 1 cells
(Fig. 6A) showed the aromatase inhibition by PTK/ZK (P < 0.01).
These results were supported by measuring the aromatase activity
of human placental microsomes (data not shown). The in vitro
potency of this agent as an aromatase inhibitor was compared with
the established aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole,
using MCF7 AROM cell microsomes. The IC50 values were 3 nmol/L
(letrozole), 100 nmol/L (anastrozole), and 50 nmol/L (PTK/ZK;
Supplementary Fig. S4). Having established that PTK/ZK is an
aromatase inhibitor, we next investigated how this inhibition was
mediated. To determine the K i value of PTK/ZK, the conversion of
the substrate [1h-3H]-androstenedione at increasing concentrations by human placental aromatase in the absence and presence
of PTK/ZK was analyzed. Results, expressed as formation of 3H2O
in protein (pmol/h/mg), were plotted in a Lineweaver-Burk plot.
The resulting plot revealed two straight lines, which intersected on
the y axis of the double reciprocal plot, a typical finding for a
competitive inhibitor. The K m and K i values determined from the
plot was 30 and 101 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 6B). It was possible

that PTK/ZK might be inhibiting a kinase that regulates aromatase
activity. We, therefore, addressed the possibility that the antiaromatase activity of PTK/ZK might be acting through tyrosine
kinase inhibition. However, neither sorafenib (VEGFR and plateletderived growth factor receptor inhibitor) nor imatinib (c-KIT and
c-FMS inhibitor) inhibited aromatase (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the
ability of PTK/ZK to suppress aromatase activity is likely to be
independent of the tyrosine kinases VEGFRs, c-KIT, or c-FMS.
Computer modeling supports novel aromatase inhibitory
action of PTK/ZK. To provide a structural explanation for the
novel aromatase inhibitory activity of PTK/ZK, we carried out
computer-assisted molecular modeling studies. We used two
independent models to investigate this. Both suggest that PTK/
ZK binds favorably with aromatase, providing further support for
our data showing that PTK/ZK is an aromatase inhibitor (Fig. 6C
and D). From a pharmacophore model (17), it can be concluded
that PTK/ZK presents two structural characteristics consistent
with its ability to inhibit aromatase: a heme-binding group and a
hydrophobic moiety fitting in the sterically allowed region of the
active site (Fig. 6C). However, according to the model, the most
potent azole inhibitors of aromatase, such as letrozole, possess a
chemical moiety able to mimic rings C and D of androstenedione,
the enzyme natural substrate. This is not the case for PTK/ZK.
Although the compound can be fitted in the accessible volume
above the plane of the steroid substrate, it does not overlap with
the latter, in particular with rings C and D or equivalently with the
cyanophenyl ring of letrozole mimicking these features. This is
likely the reason why the compound does not show the very high
inhibitory potency achieved with letrozole.

In the second model, PTK/ZK was docked into a homology
model of aromatase using the GOLD program (Fig. 6D). To verify
the docking results, the aromatase substrate metyrapone was
docked using the same parameters and compared with the X-ray
structure of cytochrome P450CYP3A4. The docked structure of
PTK/ZK with aromatase showed that the pyridine moiety of PTK/
ZK superimposes onto the pyridine moeity of metyrapone, enabling
the nitrogen atom to make electrostatic interactions with the
heme. We also modeled other small molecule inhibitors to test
whether the aromatase inhibitory activity of PTK/ZK could be a
universal property of TKIs. A range of small molecule inhibitors
and known aromatase inhibitors were docked into the model of
aromatase [lapatinib (GW572016), lonafarnib (SCH66336), tipifarnib (R115777), sorafenib (BAY439006), vandetanib (ZD6474), everolimus (RAD001)]. Only letrozole, anastrozole, and PTK/ZK docked
in the favored orientation with a ring nitrogen pointing toward the
heme iron.

Discussion
The development of dual target inhibitors for the treatment of
breast cancer has generated much interest. For example, lapatinib
targets the tyrosine kinases EGFR and HER2 (18) and is showing
some success in the clinic (19). Recently, dual aromatase and
sulfatase inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical breast
cancer models (20). However, these approaches have been limited,
thus far, to the inhibition of similar classes of targets, for example,
either tyrosine kinases or E2 synthesis. Here, we show for the first
time that a single chemical entity, a TKI developed to target

favorably with aromatase. Our findings suggest that this property is
likely to be unique to PTK/ZK among drugs under clinical
development but the recognition of the dual activity might allow
related compounds that have increased dual potency/specificity for
the two targets to be developed.
PTK/ZK, currently under clinical evaluation, was developed as a
potent and selective TKI of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1. Kinase
inhibitor selectivity studies indicate that PTK/ZK is a relatively
selective kinase inhibitor (21). Several preclinical studies have
confirmed VEGFR inhibition of endothelial cells and resulting
antiangiogenic effects in in vitro and in vivo tumor models.

Targeting VEGFR with TKIs in breast cancer is believed to have
great potential. Patients have already been recruited to phase II
clinical trials of PTK/ZK in breast cancer (PTK/ZK/docetaxel, PTK/
ZK/trastuzumab, and PTK/ZK and letrozole).
Our early experiments in MCF7 AROM [AROM+/ER+] cells were
suggestive of angiogenesis-independent effects of PTK/ZK. PTK/ZK
inhibited androstenedione-stimulated proliferation and decreased
androstenedione-induced ER-mediated transcription. Of importance, no vasculature or stroma was present in this cell culture
system. These effects were abrogated in the presence of estrogen
and led us to investigate the effects of PTK/ZK on aromatase
activity. Both in-cell and microsomal aromatase assays confirmed
the previously unknown aromatase inhibitory action of PTK/ZK.
The in vitro potency of PTK/ZK as an aromatase inhibitor is in a
similar range as anastrozole but is less than letrozole. The lack of
aromatase inhibition with sorafenib and imatinib suggests that
aromatase inhibition is a direct effect of PTK/ZK. Structural studies
of PTK/ZK provided further support for aromatase inhibition and
suggested that other common TKIs do not have this activity.
However, the identification of this dual activity in PTK/ZK provides
a potential opportunity to achieve enhanced aromatase inhibitory
capability in related compounds. Following, the submission of this
manuscript, the crystal structure of human aromatase (3EQM) was
published (22). Modeling studies using this structure verified the
ability of PTK787 to dock into the heme site of human aromatase.
Data from phase I trials of PTK/ZK have shown that at a dose of
1,000 mg/day, a C max of 18 Amol/L, a C min of 0.41 Amol/L, and an
AUC of 88 Amol/L h are achieved, and over a 24-hour period, the
concentration of PTK/ZK is above 1 Amol/L for the majority of the
time (23). Our findings indicate that the IC50 of PTK/ZK for
aromatase activity is submicromolar and the K i of 101nmol/L is
significantly lower than the circulating concentrations achieved in
patients. Although the dose and scheduling of PTK/ZK has been
controversial (24), of clinical relevance, the pharmacokinetic
properties of PTK/ZK at doses commonly used in clinical trials
suggest that the systemic exposure is likely to be sufficient to
provide clinically relevant aromatase inhibition. Our findings
suggest the clinical potency of PTK/ZK is likely to be inferior to
letrozole but similar to that of anastrozole. Adverse effects known
to be associated with aromatase inhibitors have been reported in
phase I/phase II clinical trials of PTK/ZK. Arthralgia was
documented in 35% of patients with hormone refractory prostate
cancer (25), and 7% of patients with gastrointestinal stromal
tumors treated with PTK/ZK reported hot flushes (26). However,
the mentioned adverse effects are nonspecific and could be due to
other factors. Clinical studies of PTK/ZK specifically designed to
measure changes in estradiol levels are necessary to establish the
full clinical implications of our finding.
These results are provocative and suggest that there are novel
mechanisms of PTK/ZK action in ER+ breast cancer. PTK/ZK was
developed as a VEGFR inhibitor and may therefore affect angiogenesis. Our data suggests that PTK/ZK also inhibits aromatase,
and this may lead to a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. The
dual pronged attack of a single agent on both angiogenesis (stroma)
and cell proliferation (tumor) has the potential to reduce breast
cancer growth and metastases. In addition, if the antiaromatase
activity clinically is relevant, then this may have serious implications
when treating premenopausal women or indeed men with this
agent in a variety of malignant and nonmalignant conditions,
because there are significant consequences of aromatase inhibition
in these groups. Finally, by studying the structure and properties of

Figure 6. PTK/ZK inhibits aromatase activity. A, microsomes were isolated from MCF7 AROM [AROM+/ER+] cells. Microsomes were treated in triplicate with
androst-4-ene-3,17-dione [1h3H(N)] (0.125 Amol/L) in the presence of vehicle (ethanol, 0.01% v/v), letrozole (LET ), PTK/ZK, sorafenib, or imatinib. Aromatase activity
was measured by the conversion of androstenedione to tritiated water and expressed relative to the vehicle control. LET and PTK/ZK inhibited aromatase activity.
*, P < 0.01 compared with vehicle. B, a competition assay using increasing concentrations of androst-4-ene-3,17-dione [1h3H(N)] was carried out to determine
the K i value and mode of aromatase inhibition of PTK/ZK. Results, expressed as formation of 3H2O in pmol/h/mg protein, were plotted in a double reciprocal Lineweaver
Burk plot [1/product (1/pmol/h/mg protein  103) versus 1/substrate (1/nmol/L  103)]. C, model for the binding mode of PTK/ZK (green ) in the active site of aromatase.

orange, the iron atom of the heme; magenta, carbon atoms of letrozole (LET ); yellow, carbon atoms of androstenedione (AND ). The letter labels indicate the C and D
rings of the core steroid structure of androstenedione. D, structural model depicting PTK/ZK binding to the heme moiety of the aromatase enzyme. Purple, PTK/ZK; red,
heme moiety of aromatase; blue, substrate metyrapone. A homology model of aromatase (CYP19A_Human) was modeled based on the crystal structure of
human cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme as a template. The docked structure of PTK/ZK in aromatase showed that the pyridine moiety of PTK/ZK superimposes
onto the pyridine group of metyrapone (aromatase substrate), enabling the nitrogen atom to make electrostatic interactions with the heme (distance, 2.4 Å). Additionally,
the binding residues identified from structural and mutational studies (reviewed in ref. 27) are also found to play a role in the binding of PTK/ZK, in particular K119,
which forms a hydrogen bond with PTK/ZK.

PTK/ZK, it may be possible for drugs to be intentionally designed to
target two distinct biological pathways with greater potency.
