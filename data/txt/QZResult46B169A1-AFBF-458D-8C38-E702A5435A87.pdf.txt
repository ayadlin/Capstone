Abstract
Autophagy is a protein and organelle degradation pathway that is involved in diverse diseases, including cancer.
Recent evidence suggests that autophagy is a cell survival mechanism in tumor cells and that its inhibition,
especially in combination with other therapy, could be beneﬁcial but it remains unclear if all cancer cells behave
the same way when autophagy is inhibited. We inhibited autophagy in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and
found that some of them are dependent on autophagy for survival even in nutrient rich conditions without any
additional stress, whereas others need autophagy only when stressed. Survival under unstressed conditions is due
to cell type–speciﬁc autophagy regulation of STAT3 activity and this phenotype is enriched in triple-negative
cell lines. This autophagy-dependency affects response to therapy because autophagy inhibition reduced tumor
growth in vivo in autophagy-dependent but not in autophagy-independent breast tumors, whereas combination
treatment with autophagy inhibitors and other agent was preferentially synergistic in autophagy-dependent cells.
These results imply that autophagy-dependence represents a tumor cell–speciﬁc characteristic where autophagy
inhibition will be more effective. Moreover, our results suggest that autophagy inhibition might be a potential
therapeutic strategy for triple-negative breast cancers, which currently lack an effective targeted treatment.

Introduction
Autophagy is a long-lived protein and organelle degradation
pathway in which cytoplasmic material is engulfed in a double
membrane structure known as the autophagosome and later
delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Macroautophagy
(referred herein as autophagy) is thought to be the major type
of autophagy (1). It has been extensively studied in recent years,
increasing our understanding of the major constituents of the
autophagic pathway, encoded by the ATG genes, and unraveling many of its roles in homeostasis and development. Most
importantly, defects in the autophagic pathway have been
involved in diverse diseases, including cancer (1–4).
Under normal conditions, basal autophagy has been proposed to function as a tumor suppressor mechanism by
reducing oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and genome instabilAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Pharmacology, and 2Pediatrics,

ity (2). However, autophagy has also been suggested to act as a
survival mechanism in established tumors. It is well known
that in cells under stress—including starvation, growth factor
deprivation, hypoxia, radio- and chemotherapy—autophagy is
upregulated to recycle cytoplasmic components and provide
the cell with amino acids and ATP to support essential
metabolic pathways and protein synthesis (2). This is critical
in tumor cells, which are constantly exposed to both metabolic
stress via hypoxia, inadequate glucose supply and increased
energetic demands of rapidly proliferating cells as well as
proteotoxic stress induced by high levels of genomic instability
found in cancers. Although this autophagy requirement could
be a generally important mechanism of survival in tumor cells,
recent evidence suggests that certain tumors are "autophagy
addicted." In this regard, RAS transformation is known to
induce high levels of basal autophagy in cancer cell lines;
autophagy is required for efﬁcient RAS-induced tumorigenesis,
and many, but not all, RAS-transformed cell lines are highly
dependent on autophagy (5–7).
Despite implementation of prevention programs and novel
therapeutic strategies, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United
States (8). One of the biggest recognized barriers to progress in
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment is the clinical and genetic
heterogeneity of the disease (9). In this regard, gene expression
analyses have led to the deﬁnition of ﬁve molecular "intrinsic"
subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-

enriched, basal-like, and claudin-low), which have differences
in incidence, survival, and response to treatment (10). Basallike and claudin-low tumors comprise the majority of triplenegative breast cancers (TNBC; ref. 10), a subgroup of tumors
that do not express clinically signiﬁcant levels of estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 and thus cannot be
treated with endocrine or anti–HER2-targeted therapies. They
include 10% to 24% of invasive breast cancers and have a worse
prognosis when compared with other tumor subtypes. Importantly, although patients with TNBC do beneﬁt from chemotherapy, there are no known targeted agents for this type of
cancer and after therapy, they tend to relapse with distant
metastases, resulting in a worse overall survival (11) and
underscoring the need to develop better, less toxic treatment
approaches.
Among many other distinctive characteristics, TNBC cells
are known to have high levels of activation of the JAK–STAT
pathway (12). STATs are transcription factors that are activated in the cytoplasm by tyrosine phosphorylation in
response to cytokine receptor activation (IFN or interleukin6) and their associated Janus-activated kinase (JAK) or to
growth factor receptor signaling (EGF and platelet–derived
growth factor), either directly or through recruitment of associated proteins (13). Cytoplasmic kinases such as SRC and
ABL1 can also phosphorylate and activate STATs (14). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleusactivating transcription. Ligand-dependent activation of
STATs is associated with cellular differentiation and growth
regulation. Conversely, their constitutive activation is associated with tumorigenesis by inducing the transcription of genes
that promote cell-cycle progression, prevention of apoptosis
(BCL2L1, CCND1, and MYC), cancer inﬂammation, and inhibition of antitumor immunity (14–16).
We found that autophagy inhibition is much more important in some breast lines than others and that cancer cell lines
with constitutively high levels of STAT3 activity were more
sensitive to autophagy inhibition than those with low levels of
basal STAT3 activity. The most autophagy-dependent lines
require autophagy to survive even under conditions with no
added metabolic stress and are enriched in the basal-like and
claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer (10). These effects were
due to autophagy-dependent STAT3 activation and were also
associated with increased ability to synergize when autophagy
was inhibited in combination with another anticancer drug.
Our results suggest that autophagy inhibition might prove
beneﬁcial especially for "basal-like" and "claudin-low" breast
cancers, which mostly constitute the TNBC subgroup and that
currently lack effective treatment strategies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All cell lines were acquired from the University of Colorado
Tissue Culture Core in 2012 and were authenticated by allele
testing (date of authentication is as follows: MCF10A, MCF7,
T47D, HCC1937, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231: October
2011; MCF12A and BT549: May 2012). After acquisition, cells
were grown, frozen, and each time they were thawed, they were

not used for longer than 6 months. Cell culture media used are
shown in Supplementary Materials and Methods. STAT3C
plasmid and its empty vector (Addgene plasmids 24983 and
14883) were a gift from Linzhao Cheng (17) and David Baltimore (18), respectively. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
were transduced with lentiviruses expressing these plasmids
and sorted for a high green ﬂuorescent population.
The autophagy short hairpin RNA library
We designed a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library
with 629 shRNAs targeting autophagy proteins from the
autophagic core machinery, proteins described in the autophagy interactome (19) and apoptosis-related proteins. A pool of
shRNA-expressing plasmids from The RNAi Consortium (TRC)
library (pLKO.1 vector) was prepared at the Functional Genomics Core of the University of Colorado Cancer Center (Boulder, CO). Of note, three to ﬁve shRNAs per gene target were
used. Lentiviruses were generated according to protocols from
TRC (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc/lib) and cells
were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3
and selected with puromycin. Posttransduction samples were
collected 18 hours after the addition of virus in quintuplicate.
Another sample of transduced cells was replated with puromycin and allowed to grow for 15 days, after which the growth
sample was collected in quintuplicate. Samples were barcoded
as described previously (20) and analyzed in an Illumina
Genome Analyzer IIX.
Functional genetic screening data were analyzed using our
in-house bioinformatics pipeline (20–24), and as described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
shRNA lentiviral transduction
Lentiviruses were prepared according to protocols published
at TRC webpage (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc/lib).
Viruses (containing either nonsilencing, ATG5 TRCN0000151474,
ATG7 TRCN0000007587, BECN1 TRCN0000033549, STAT3
TRCN0000020840, or STAT3 TRCN0000020842 pLKO.1 vectors)
were added to achieve an MOI of 5 to10. Cells were selected with
puromycin according to a dose–response curve and with the
concentrations shown on Supplementary Materials and Methods
for 2 to 3 days, then tripsinized and used for experiments.
Viability assays
For long-term clonogenic assays, cells were plated in 12-well
plates and allowed to grow for 8 to 10 days. They were ﬁxed and
stained with crystal violet (Becton, Dickinson and Company).
Stain was solubilized and absorbance was measured at 540 nm.
For proliferation curves, cells were counted at 3, 6, 8, or 10 days
after plating. Trypan blue–negative cells were considered viable.
For MTS assays, cells were plated in 96-well plates and
allowed to grow for 2 to 6 days. Cells were treated with MTS
reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell death assessment, media were collected and
evaluated for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity with the
LDH Cytoscan Cytotoxicity Kit (G-Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. For time-lapse movies, cells
were plated at equal densities and imaged for 48 hours. For
propidium iodide (PI) staining, cells transduced with the

different shRNAs were plated, allowed to grow for 48 hours,
stained with PI, and imaged.
Protein isolation and Western blots
Of note, 2 to 3 days after plating, cells were lysed with RIPA
buffer containing protease inhibitor (Roche) and Halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Protein was
quantitated using Bradford reagent. Antibodies used are listed
in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Western blot analysis ﬁgures show a portion of the membranes containing the
corresponding bands cropped for clarity.
Animal studies
All animal studies were performed in accordance with the
Colorado State University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female nude nu/nu mice were purchased from the National
Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) and challenged with 5  106
MDA-MB-231 cells. Female nude nu/nu mice were ﬁrst ovariectomized and received a subcutaneous, 60 day release, 0.25mg estradiol implant (Innovative Research). Mice were then
challenged, 7 days later, with 5  106 MCF7 cells. Cells (100 mL)
in 50% serum-free media and 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad. Upon reaching
a tumor volume of 100 mm3, mice received either 60 mg/kg
chloroquine diphosphate salt or 0.9% saline given by intraperitoneal injection, once daily for the duration of the study. The
study was followed until tumors reached four times initial
volume (TV 4; ref. 25).
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were determined using a two-sample
equal variance Student t test. Log-rank analysis for the Kaplan–
Meier curves was done in Prism v5.0a. Three MCF7 xenografts
did not quite reach four times initial volume (TV 4), so time to
reach TV 4 was extrapolated using calculated tumor doubling
time. The combination index (CI) was calculated using CompuSyn (ComboSyn, Inc.).
A more detailed description of the Materials and Methods
section was included in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Results
The autophagy-focused shRNA lentiviral library
We designed an autophagy-speciﬁc shRNA library, targeting
the core components of the autophagic pathway (ATG genes)
as well as some of their interacting proteins (19) and used this
library to evaluate "autophagy dependence" in a panel of breast
cancer cell lines. Because functions independent from autophagy have been described for ATG genes (26–28), we reasoned
that if autophagy is important for tumor cell survival and
proliferation to different extents in different cell lines, this
would be manifested by differential selection for or against
shRNAs that target the autophagy pathway during cell growth,
leading to overall differences in the pattern of shRNA representation of the library in different breast cell populations, and
not to changes in the shRNA of a particular ATG protein. On the
other hand, if autophagy is not important for the growth or

www.aacrjournals.org

survival of cells, shRNA representation after growth selection
should be similar to the starting population. Because the
approach examines large numbers of shRNAs whose only
similarity is their connection to autophagy, differences in the
overall representation of the whole library should represent
the importance of autophagy itself rather than any other
function for individual autophagy regulators (Fig. 1A). We
used a nontumorigenic cell line (MCF12A), two luminal (MCF7
and T47D), and two triple-negative cell lines, one basal (MDAMB-468) and one claudin-low (MDA-MB-231), according to the
classiﬁcation by Prat and colleagues (10). One DNA sample was
collected 18 hours after transduction (posttransduction) and
another sample collected 15 days following cell growth in
complete medium, both in quintuplicate. Samples were barcoded and analyzed by next-generation sequencing as
described previously (20). Hierarchical clustering of the shRNA
readouts produced two main clusters (Fig. 1B). The ﬁrst cluster
contained all the posttransduction samples combined with the
MCF7 and MCF12A growth samples, indicating a similar
shRNA representation among these conditions. The second
cluster included MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MDA-MB-468
growth samples, suggesting differences in shRNA representation between this group of samples and the other cluster, but a
similar representation among them. Those shRNAs "lost" in the
growth sample but present in the posttransduction represent
proteins essential for growth, because their knockdown causes
decreased proliferation or cell death and a lack of representation of the shRNA in the growth sample (as in Fig. 1A,
panel 1). One condition cluster in the heatmap showed shRNAs
that had less reads in growth samples of MDA-MB-231, T47D,
and MDA-MB-468 cell lines when compared with the posttransduction cluster (Supplementary Fig. S1). This cluster
included mostly shRNAs that target autophagy at the nucleation and expansion steps, indicating that MDA-MB-231,
T47D, and MDA-MB-468 had a decreased proliferation or
death induction when transduced with these shRNAs, suggesting these cells were sensitive to autophagy inhibition. On the
other hand, MCF7 and MCF12A cell lines clustered with the
posttransduction samples with no signiﬁcant selection for or
against the shRNAs during the 15-day growth period, indicating they proliferate normally despite having shRNAs that target
the autophagic pathway. These results suggest that breast
cancer cell lines behave differently when autophagy is modulated and that some breast cancer cell lines are dependent on
autophagy for proliferation or survival, whereas others are
much less dependent on it. A complete list of the shRNAs in the
library and their representation per cell line is included in
Supplementary Table S1.
Breast cancer cell lines have a differential sensitivity to
autophagy inhibition
We validated our shRNA library results with individual
shRNAs targeting the core autophagy proteins ATG5, ATG7,
and BECN1 that were each independently validated as inhibiting autophagy. Figure 2A shows a panel of breast cell lines
organized in increasing sensitivity to autophagy inhibition in
complete medium when measured by a clonogenic survival
assay. These cell lines were differentially affected in their

Figure 1. The autophagy-focused shRNA library. A, experimental outline. Cells were transduced with a shRNA library containing autophagy-focused shRNAs. After
transduction, posttransduction (PT) samples were collected. Growth samples (G) were collected after 15 days in culture, both in quintuplicate. Hypothetical
heatmaps for the three possible outcomes are shown in the ﬁgure, showing different representations of shRNA tag counts. If most shRNAs targeted a process
important for cell survival (yellow cell) or proliferation (green cell), they would be underrepresented in the growth sample when compared with posttransduction
and the overall representation of shRNAs would look as in panel 1. The dendogram would produce two different clusters with quintuplicates grouping together. If
shRNAs in this cluster represent shRNAs that target the autophagic pathway, then autophagy would be important for proliferation/survival in these cells. If
the shRNAs had no effect on proliferation/survival (black cells), the heatmap would look as in panel 2 and samples would cluster without a clear distinction between
posttransduction and growth. If this cluster was enriched in shRNAs targeting the autophagic pathway, it would mean that autophagy has no effect on growth/
proliferation. Finally, if the shRNAs gave a proliferative advantage (red cells), they would be overrepresented in the growth sample when compared with the
posttransduction and representation would look as in panel 3. The dendogram would produce two well-deﬁned groups representing posttransduction and
growth samples. If these were shRNAs inhibiting autophagy, it would mean that autophagy decreases proliferation or induces cell death in these cells. B, hierarchical
clustering of breast cancer cell lines transduced with an autophagy-focused shRNA library produced two main clusters. Posttransduction samples from all
cell lines are labeled in black. First cluster included all the posttransduction samples as well as MCF7 and MCF12A growth samples. Second cluster included

Autophagy and STAT3 Control Breast Cancer Survival

(MCF10A and MCF12A), two luminal (MCF7 and T47D), and four TNBC cell lines (two basal, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468; and two claudin-low, MDAMB-231 and BT549) were transduced with shRNAs against ATG5, ATG7, or BECN1 and tested for clonogenic proliferation 8 days after plating. A,

decrease in cell number in MCF7, MCF12A, and T47D cells with
autophagy inhibition, the fact that cell number continued to
increase over time in the knockdown cells suggested that their
proliferation rate was only decreased. The most affected cell
lines were MDA-MB-231, HCC1937, BT549, and MDA-MB-468
(Fig. 2A and B), in which autophagy inhibition greatly
decreased proliferation, or completely inhibited it. Importantly, the three shRNAs showed a similar response in each cell line.

These results, together with the autophagy library screen,
suggest that inhibition of the autophagic pathway and not an
unspeciﬁc effect of the inhibition of a certain ATG gene
differentially affects breast cancer cell proliferation or survival.
Analysis of clonogenic experiments and growth curves
from all the cell lines indicated that TNBC cell lines (basal
and claudin-low) were the most sensitive to autophagy
inhibition (Fig. 2A and B). Conversely, in nontumorigenic

and luminal cells, proliferation was induced (MCF10A) or
was decreased to a much lesser extent (MCF12A, MCF7, and
T47D) than TNBC cell lines, suggesting a delay in cell
proliferation rather than cell death. The shRNAs were effective at knocking down their target proteins in all cell lines,
showing markedly decreased starvation-induced autophagy
as measured by LC3-II accumulation when autophagic ﬂux
was blocked (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Decreased clonogenic growth could be caused by
decreased proliferation or cell death. To test these possibilities, we chose a luminal line with only a modest effect of
autophagy inhibition (MCF7) and two TNBC cell lines
(MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) in which autophagy inhibition had a signiﬁcant effect and imaged them by timelapse microscopy after transduction with nonsilencing,
ATG7 or BECN1 shRNAs (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Movies
1–6). The same number of cells were plated for all conditions
and Fig. 3A shows the cells after 48 hours. ATG7 and BECN1
knockdown resulted in a decreased number of cells when
compared with the nonsilencing controls in the three cell
lines. MCF7 cells after ATG7 or BECN1 knockdown looked
normal and only proliferated at a somewhat slower rate
compared with the nonsilencing cells, resulting in smaller
colonies. Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cells showed signiﬁcantly decreased proliferation when compared with the nonsilencing controls and some cells died. The most affected cells
were MDA-MB-468s, in which ATG7 and BECN1 knockdown
cells did not proliferate and most of these cells died during
the 48 hours period. In agreement with these observations,
MCF7 cells did not show an increase in LDH release in a 6day period when autophagy was inhibited (Fig. 3B). MDAMB-231 cells showed increased LDH release after 6 days and
MDA-MB-468 cells showed a maximum LDH release since
day 3. All three cell lines had a similar knockdown when
measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Similar results
were found in a PI staining experiment to measure cell
death, in which the highest increase in PI staining was seen
on the MDA-MB-468 cells in which autophagy had been
inhibited (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Because autophagy inhibition did not induce cell death in
MCF7 cells, we tested the functionality of the autophagic
pathway in these cells by starving them with Earle's Balanced
Salt Solution, a standard treatment for autophagy induction.
Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine treatment (Fig. 3D) or inhibition of autophagy with ATG7 or BECN1
shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S3B) greatly decreased cell viability in a clonogenic assay, suggesting that MCF7 cells need
autophagy for survival but only under stressed conditions.
Chloroquine treatment had a similar effect as ATG7 or
BECN1 knockdown when cells were grown in full medium
(Fig. 4). A differential sensitivity to chloroquine was found
among all the breast cancer cell lines, with the TNBC cells
again being the most sensitive. An increase in LC3II was
observed in all the cell lines with chloroquine treatment (Fig.
4). However, this increase in LC3II did not correlate with
sensitivity to autophagy inhibition, suggesting that differences in basal autophagy among the cell lines are not the
cause of autophagy dependence. Together, these data show

that breast cancer cell lines differ greatly in their dependency on autophagy, with some lines barely affected when
autophagy is inhibited, some showing only growth inhibition, and some dying. The most autophagy-dependent cells
tended to be the triple negatives, which require autophagy
for their survival even under conditions of no added stress.
Autophagy regulates STAT3 phosphorylation and cell
survival
Autophagy has recently been linked to JAK/STAT pathway
activation (29–31) and some breast cancer cell lines are
known to have high levels of constitutively activated STAT3,
particularly those belonging to the TNBC subgroup (12, 32).

Autophagy and STAT3 Control Breast Cancer Survival

STAT3 knockdown did not induce a substantial amount of
LDH release, suggesting that proliferation was impaired but
that MCF7 cells are not STAT3 dependent. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 with Stattic, a STAT3 smallmolecule inhibitor (34), killed breast cancer cell lines in a
similar manner and with the same relative speciﬁcity to
autophagy inhibition by chloroquine or ATG gene knockdown (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 could not be detected in
MCF7 cells in basal conditions (Fig. 5A) or upon autophagy
inhibition (Fig. 5E). On the other hand, ATG gene knockdown
decreased tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in both the MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells and led to a reduction in the
levels of transcriptional targets of STAT3-like cyclin D and
BCL2L1 (also known as BCL-XL, Fig. 5E). Similar results were
observed in the other triple-negative cell lines (HCC1937 and
BT549; Supplementary Fig. S4B). Pharmacologic inhibition
of autophagy by chloroquine treatment (Fig. 5F) also
decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Together, these data suggest that
autophagy inhibition decreases STAT3 phosphorylation in
TNBC cell lines and that this reduction in STAT3 activity
induces cell death. To test this, we overexpressed a constitutively active form of STAT3 (STAT3C), which partially
restored phospho-Tyr STAT3 levels (Fig. 6A) and decreased
death induced by autophagy inhibition in both MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-468 cell lines (Fig. 6B).

different concentrations of chloroquine (CQ; mmol/L) and evaluated for

Importantly, basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer comprise most (70%–80%) of TNBC (10) and the basal
and claudin-low cell lines used in this study are known to be
triple negative (33).
In agreement with previous reports (12), TNBC cell lines
(MDA-MB-231, HCC1937, BT549, and MDA-MB-468) showed
substantially higher levels of activated STAT3 by Tyr phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) than the luminal cell lines. These cells
were determined to be STAT3 dependent, because genetic
inhibition of STAT3 by gene knockdown showed a signiﬁcant increase in LDH release as well as decreased MTS
activity (Fig. 5B) and clonogenic growth (Fig. 5C) in both
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. Although MCF7 cells
showed a decrease in MTS activity and clonogenic growth,

performed mouse xenograft studies with the MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines. Tumor growth was followed until tumors
reached four times initial volume (TV 4) as suggested by
Teicher (25). Chloroquine treatment signiﬁcantly delayed the
median time to reach TV 4 of mice injected with MDA-MB-231
cells and not in those having MCF7 xenografts (Fig. 7A). LC3
staining revealed more LC3-positive puncta in the chloroquine-treated tumors when compared with their respective
vehicle-treated controls, indicating inhibition of autophagy in
both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 chloroquine-treated tumors.
These results suggest that autophagy inhibition has differential
effects on breast cancer tumors in vivo and that TNBC tumors
similar to the MDA-MB-231 xenografts are more likely to
beneﬁt from autophagy inhibition even in the absence of
treatment with other agents.
Autophagy inhibition with chloroquine synergizes with
chemotherapy primarily in autophagy-dependent cells
Because MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were the
most affected by autophagy inhibition, we hypothesized that
chloroquine treatment would synergize with chemotherapy in
these cells. Figure 7B shows the CI for treatment with doxorubicin and chloroquine at different concentrations. MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468 cells showed the highest synergy (log CI
< 0), whereas the combined treatment in MCF7 cells was only
weakly synergistic in most concentrations tested and even
antagonistic in others (log CI > 0).

Discussion
Autophagy is frequently increased in tumors, particularly in
areas of low oxygen and blood supply, where it serves as a
survival mechanism that helps the cells survive periods of
metabolic stress (35). Although autophagy could, in principle,
serve as a general survival mechanism in all tumor cells, recent
studies suggest that certain types of cancers are particularly
sensitive to autophagy inhibition. In this regard, pancreatic
and RAS-transformed cancers seem to have high energetic
requirements that are supported by autophagic mitigation of
reactive oxygen species (6), and autophagic maintenance of
mitochondrial (5) and glucose metabolism (7). However, even
with RAS-driven cancers, the role of autophagy is context

2586

Cancer Res; 74(9) May 1, 2014

dependent because a recent study suggests that autophagy
inhibition prevents Kras-driven tumor development when p53
is wild-type but promotes tumorigenesis and progression
when p53 is deleted (36).
In this work, we studied autophagy dependence in a panel
of breast cancer cell lines representing different intrinsic
subtypes of the disease. Importantly, breast cancer has not
previously been considered particularly addicted to autophagy. Only two previous studies have suggested that autophagy could be a therapeutic target in breast cancer: one
using the MDA-MB-231 cell line, which is KRAS transformed
(7), and another one using the MMTV (mouse mammary
tumor virus)–PyMT mouse model of breast cancer, which

Autophagy and STAT3 Control Breast Cancer Survival

STAT3 decreases cell death
induced by autophagy inhibition.
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cells were transduced with a
lentivirus expressing a
constitutively active form of STAT3
(STAT3C). A, as shown by Western
blot analysis, STAT3C increased pTyr STAT3 levels after autophagy
inhibition with ATG7 (A7) or BECN1
(B1) shRNAs. B, cells were then
evaluated for death with an LDH
assay 3 days (MDA-MB-231) or 1
day (MDA-MB-468) after plating.

induces Ras, Src, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation
(37). Importantly, RAS has not been found to be frequently
activated in breast cancer (38).
Here, we found that different subtypes of breast cancer
vary markedly in their dependence on autophagy, with
TNBC cell lines displaying particular sensitivity to autophagy inhibition by ATG gene knockdown or chloroquine
treatment when compared with luminal and nontransformed cell lines (Figs 1–3). These cells were dependent on
autophagy for survival even in complete media, i.e., in the
absence of stresses, which are known to stimulate autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis. Conversely in autophagy-independent MCF7 cells autophagy was needed for
survival upon starvation but not in unstressed conditions.
Autophagy dependence was also independent of RAS pathway status because the only TNBC cell line that we used that
is known to be RAS mutated is the MDA-MB-231 cell line
(39). Instead, we found that STAT3 constitutive activity is
regulated by autophagy only in some cells and that this is
required and sufﬁcient for autophagy dependence for survival (Figs 5 and 6). This differential requirement for autophagy has effects on tumor treatment because mice with
chloroquine-treated MDA-MB-231 xenografts had a better
event-free survival (when compared with their matched
controls) than those with MCF7 tumors (Fig. 7A) and
autophagy inhibition with chloroquine treatment synergized
with chemotherapy in cell lines that were autophagy-dependent and not in the ones that were autophagy-independent
(Fig. 7B).
The effect of autophagy inhibition during cancer treatment
remains a controversial issue (1, 4, 40). Although numerous
studies have shown a signiﬁcant decrease in cell number with
autophagy inhibition in combination with radio- or chemotherapy in breast cancer cell lines (41, 42) and in tumor
xenografts (43–45); other studies show a limited or null effect
(46). Although it makes sense that autophagy inhibition may

www.aacrjournals.org

be more beneﬁcial when used with particular cancer therapies (e.g., those that themselves directly activate the autophagy pathway), our data suggest that in addition, only some
cancer cells will really beneﬁt from its suppression during
treatment. Particularly, we propose that TNBCs with high
constitutive levels of STAT3 phosphorylation will be autophagy dependent and will, therefore, respond the most to
autophagy inhibition alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Therefore, synergy with chemotherapy and autophagy inhibition will work best in such tumor cells. The
mechanism by which autophagy promotes STAT3 phosphorylation remains to be determined.
Recent studies have suggested a correlation between the
autophagic marker LC3B and patient outcome in breast cancer, in which breast cancers with the highest LC3B expression
were found to show increased markers for cell proliferation,
aggressiveness, and had the worst outcome (47, 48). About
breast cancer subtypes, Lazova and colleagues found that only
luminal A tumors correlated between LC3B expression and
poor outcome, whereas Chen and colleagues found this correlation only in TNBC. Although both studies suggest that
increased LC3B total staining could be used as a marker of
increased autophagy, this is not necessarily true because
increased total LC3 or autophagosome number could also
reﬂect a block in autophagic ﬂux (49). Our results suggest that
regardless of the levels of autophagy in breast cancer cells,
molecular markers like activated STAT3, could be used to
determine which breast cancers would beneﬁt the most from
autophagy inhibition.
This work has potential therapeutic implications because
TNBC has the worst prognosis among all breast cancers. There
are currently no speciﬁc therapies for patients with TNBC and,
although they can be treated with chemotherapy, they tend to
relapse and metastasize early (11). Our results suggest that this
subtype of the disease may be most responsive to autophagy
inhibition and that screening for high levels of constitutive
