BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy results in substantial survival benefits for patients with hormone receptor-positive
breast cancer. The rates of poor adherence and discontinuation of AI therapy are high, primarily because of treatment-related toxicities like musculoskeletal pain. Although pain-related symptoms may worsen during AI therapy, the authors hypothesized that nonpersistence with AI therapy was associated with symptoms that were present before treatment initiation. METHODS:
Postmenopausal women initiating AI therapy who were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial completed questionnaires at baseline to
assess sleep, fatigue, mood, and pain. Reasons for treatment discontinuation during the first year of treatment were recorded. Associations between baseline patient-reported symptoms and treatment discontinuation because of toxicity were identified using logistic
regression. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-nine patients were evaluable. The odds of treatment discontinuation were higher in patients
who reported a greater number of symptoms before AI initiation. Baseline poor sleep quality was associated with early treatment discontinuation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.89; P 5.002). Baseline presence of tired feeling and
forgetfulness had similar ORs for discontinuation (tired feeling: OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.15-2.67; P 5.009; forgetfulness: OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.112.48; P 5.015). An increasing total number of baseline symptoms was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment discontinuation, with an OR of 1.89 (95% CI, 1.20-2.96; P 5.006) for 3 to 5 symptoms versus 0 to 2 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom clusters in breast cancer survivors that are present before the initiation of adjuvant AI therapy may have a negative impact on a patient’s
persistence with therapy. Interventions to manage these symptoms may improve breast cancer outcomes and quality of life. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are routinely used for adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor
(ER)-positive, early stage breast cancer. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improvements in disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with AI therapy compared with tamoxifen.1,2 Early discontinuation of AI therapy, however, has been observed in >25% of patients, primarily caused by the toxicity of therapy.3,4 Nonadherence to AI
therapy has been associated with increases in mortality.5
The most common toxicities reported by AI-treated patients are musculoskeletal symptoms, including arthralgias
and myalgias.3 Attempts to identify the cause of these side effects have focused on clinical and treatment factors, such as
time since menopause, body mass index (BMI), prior tamoxifen therapy, and prior taxane chemotherapy.3,6-8 Despite
those studies, the etiology of AI toxicity remains undefined, although it is believed to be caused, at least in part, by estrogen
depletion.9,10 Vitamin D deficiency may also play a role in the development of toxicity.11
Studies of breast cancer survivors have demonstrated high rates of patient-reported symptoms, including pain,
insomnia, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disorders, which can be present during all phases of treatment and
can persist into the survivorship period.12,13 A similar constellation of symptoms is commonly reported by patients with

other chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia
and temporomandibular joint disorder.14 In patients with
breast cancer, these symptoms may partly arise from the
multiple treatment modalities used for disease management, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and=or endocrine therapy. In addition, these
symptoms may be related to the stress of the diagnosis
itself.15
By using data from the 503-patient Exemestane and
Letrozole Pharmacogenetics (ELPh) trial, we previously
reported associations between clinical and treatment factors and early discontinuation of therapy because of toxicity.3 In that study, >75% of patients reported
musculoskeletal pain at the time of discontinuation. On
the basis of the literature from other chronic pain disorders, we hypothesized that some breast cancer patients
who develop musculoskeletal pain might also have other
symptoms that are observed in response to stressors, such
as sleep disturbances, fatigue, mood disorders, and cognitive dysfunction.16 If this were the case, then it is possible
that some individuals would discontinue AI therapy
because of their total symptom burden at baseline, not
solely because of the emergence of their musculoskeletal
pain.17,18 In this article, we report associations between
the presence of patient-reported symptoms before the initiation of an AI and treatment discontinuation within 1
year of starting the drug in the ELPh trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants

Postmenopausal women with stage 0 through III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who were initiating
treatment with an AI were eligible for enrollment on the
ELPh trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00228956).
Details of the ELPh trial have been reported elsewhere.19
In brief, all indicated surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were completed before enrollment, and
patients who previously received tamoxifen therapy were
permitted to enroll. The clinical trial was approved by the
institutional review boards at all 3 participating sites, and
patients were required to provide written informed consent before undergoing study-related procedures.
Study Procedures

Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with oral
exemestane (Aromasin; Pfizer, New York, NY) 25 mg
daily or oral letrozole (Femara; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) 2.5 mg daily. Before AI initiation, enrolled patients
completed a battery of questionnaires and underwent
phlebotomy. Patients then initiated treatment and
2404

returned to the clinic for follow-up assessments, including
phlebotomy and questionnaire completion, after 1
month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months
of AI therapy.
Questionnaires

At each time point, patients completed the following questionnaires: depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-–
Depression [CESD])20; anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale-Anxiety [HADS-A])21; sleep quality
(Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI])22; and general
symptoms, including joint pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and vaginal dryness (the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [BCPT] Symptom Checklist).23
Laboratory Studies

Serum samples obtained at the baseline and 3-month time
points were assayed for estradiol (E2), estrone-1-sulfate
(E1S), and estrone (E1) using an ultrasensitive gas
chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy assay, as
previously described.24 The lower limits of quantification
were 0.625 pg=mL for E2, 2.88 pg=mL for E1S, and
1.56 pg=mL for E1.
Statistical Plan

The primary objective of the ELPh trial was to determine
the genetic predictors of change in breast density after 24
months of either an azole (letrozole) or a steroidal
(exemestane) AI medication; those results are being published separately.25 The primary objective of the exploratory analysis reported in this article was to investigate
associations between patient-reported symptoms before
AI initiation and discontinuation of AI therapy because of
toxicity during the initial 12 months of therapy.
Validated questionnaires to evaluate fatigue or cognitive dysfunction were not included in this trial. Therefore, to investigate these symptoms, the following
individual items on the BCPT questionnaire23 were analyzed: “joint pain” (pain), “forgetfulness” and “difficulty
concentrating” (cognitive dysfunction), and “tired feeling” (fatigue). “Vaginal dryness” was also analyzed as a
common AI-related symptom, which is believed to be predominantly peripherally mediated rather than centrally
mediated. The presence of each symptom was defined as
the patient reporting any degree of severity of the symptom (ie, slightly, moderately, quite a bit, or extremely).
Descriptive analyses were conducted of all baseline
characteristics for the entire sample and by discontinuation status. Odds ratios (ORs) and their significance comparing the characteristics of women who discontinued AI

therapy because of symptoms by the end of 1 year with
the characteristics of women who remained on treatment
at 1 year were calculated using logistic regression. Baseline
characteristics that were associated with AI discontinuation because of symptoms by the end of the first year by a
P value < .20 were included in a multivariable model in
which a stepwise procedure was used to identify those variables that were associated significantly with AI discontinuation because of toxicity. Estrogen measurements were
natural log-transformed in all models.
In addition, symptoms were combined to account for
the total number of symptoms each patient experienced at
baseline. Symptoms that were included in this variable
were sleep quality (poor [PSQI >5] vs good [PSQI 5]),
concentration (any severity vs none or no severity), tired
feeling (any severity vs none or no severity), anxiety (none
or no: HADS-A 7 vs borderline or definite: HADS-A
>7), and depression (none [CESD <16] vs possible or
probable [CESD 16]). If the baseline characteristic score
was missing, then it was conservatively coded as a 0, and
the total number of symptoms was summed for each
patient for a final number of symptoms ranging from 0 to
5. The total number of symptoms was dichotomized as either from 0 to 2 or from 3 to 5, and the association between
this variable and AI discontinuation was assessed in the univariate and multivariable setting. All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

months (Fig. 1). Enrolled patients who discontinued therapy within 1 year of treatment initiation because of toxicity were compared with those who continued study
participation beyond the 1-year time point (Table 1).
During the 24-month study, in total, 51 patients discontinued therapy for reasons other than treatment-emergent
toxicity, including inability to undergo phlebotomy and
recovery of ovarian function, as previously reported.3
Of the 449 patients who were eligible for the analysis, 140 (31.2%) discontinued AI therapy because of
symptoms by the end of the first year of treatment (Table
1). Patients who discontinued therapy were significantly
younger than those who continued therapy (median age,
56 years vs 60 years; OR, 0.97; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.95-1.00; P 5 .035). As previously reported,3 no
univariate statistically significant association (at the
P 5 .05 level) was identified between treatment discontinuation and BMI (P 5 .76), baseline serum estrogen concentration (E2, P 5 .50; E1S, P 5 .18; and E1, P 5 .73),
race (P 5 .33), previous receipt of chemotherapy
(P 5 .51), taxane-based chemotherapy (P 5 .18), radiation therapy (P 5 .51), prior tamoxifen (P 5 .18), or prior
hormone-replacement therapy (P 5 .18). Similarly, there
was no statistically significant association between stage of
breast cancer at diagnosis and the likelihood of treatment
discontinuation (P 5 .99). Treatment with exemestane
was associated significantly with an increased risk of treatment discontinuation compared with letrozole treatment
(OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.12-2.51; P 5 .012).
Although half of the analyzed patients started AI
therapy within 6 months of undergoing definitive surgery,
the time interval ranged from 0 to 109 months. The time
from surgery to the initiation of AI therapy was not

the first year of treatment is illustrated according to baseline
symptoms that were present before AI initiation. Light bars
represent the percentage of total evaluable patients who discontinued AI therapy within 1 year, and dark bars represent

associated significantly with AI discontinuation because
of symptoms. Those who discontinued therapy had a median time since surgery of 8 months (range, 1-108
months), whereas those who remained on AI therapy
beyond 12 months had a median time since surgery of 6
months (range, 0-109 months; P 5 .11).
Patient-Reported Symptoms Before AI Therapy
Initiation and Treatment Discontinuation

In the ELPh trial, 67 patients (15%) reported being possibly or probably depressed at the time of AI initiation
(using the CESD), and 64 patients (14.3%) reported
being borderline or definitely anxious (using the HADSA questionnaire) (Table 1, Fig. 2). An analysis of depressive symptomatology scores as a dichotomous variable
(possibly or probably depressed vs not depressed) using
the CESD questionnaire did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between depression before AI
initiation and an increased risk of treatment discontinuation within the first year (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.88-2.58;
P 5 .14). Similarly, no significant association was identified between pre-existing anxiety assessed using the
HADS-A questionnaire and discontinuation of AI therapy (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.62-1.93; P 5 .75).
In the ELPh trial, 206 patients (47.9%) reported
poor sleep quality on the PSQI questionnaire before the
initiation of AI therapy (Table 1, Fig. 2). A larger percentage of patients who had poor sleep quality before AI initiaCancer

tion discontinued therapy because of toxicity by 1 year
compared with those who had good sleep quality (59% vs
42.9%; OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.26-2.89; P 5 .002). Of the
206 patients who reported poor sleep quality before AI
initiation, 139 (67.5%) reported poor sleep quality at
75% of their subsequent visits during AI therapy, and 7
who reported sleep problems at the initial assessment discontinued therapy before the next time point. Fifty-seven
of those 139 patients (41%) patients discontinued AI
treatment by the end of 1 year.
Other patient-reported symptoms were collected
using a general symptom questionnaire (Table 1, Fig. 2).
No statistically significant association was identified
between patient-reported presence of joint pain at baseline and treatment discontinuation because of toxicity
(63.8% vs 56.2%, respectively; OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.912.08; P 5 .14). Patients who reported forgetfulness or
feeling tired before AI initiation were more likely to discontinue therapy because of toxicity compared with those
who did not report having the symptom (forgetfulness:
55.1% vs 42.5%; OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.11-2.48;
P 5 .015; tired feeling: 67.4% vs 54.1%; OR, 1.76; 95%
CI, 1.15-2.67; P 5 .009). In addition, there was no statistically significant univariate association between difficulty
concentrating before starting AI therapy and treatment
discontinuation (28.1% vs 21.2%, respectively; OR,
1.45; 95% CI, 0.92-2.13; P 5 .11) or vaginal dryness and
treatment discontinuation (37% vs 29.6%, respectively;
OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.91-2.13; P 5 .13).
The following 5 symptoms were combined to assess
whether having more symptoms at baseline was associated
with treatment discontinuation: poor sleep quality (PSQI
score, >5), depression (CESD score, 16), anxiety
(HADS-A score, 7), any degree of tired feeling, and any
degree of difficulty concentrating. Patients who reported a
greater number of symptoms before treatment initiation
were more likely to discontinue therapy because of toxicity (Fig. 3). There was a statistically significant difference
in the treatment discontinuation rate among those who
reported the presence of 0 symptoms, 1 or 2 symptoms,
and 3 to 5 symptoms before AI initiation (P 5 .007). Of
the 117 patients who did not report any of these symptoms at baseline, 26 (22%) discontinued AI therapy
within 1 year because of side effects. Of the 225 patients
who reported 1 or 2 symptoms before AI initiation, 69
(31%) discontinued AI therapy. In contrast, of the 107
patients who had 3 of these symptoms, 45 (42%) discontinued AI therapy. Compared with those patients who
reported none of the symptoms at baseline, those patients
with 1 or 2 symptoms at baseline had an increased

By including all variables in Table 1 that were related in
the univariate analysis to discontinuation, we sought a

These are multivariable logistic regression results from a step-down analysis of treatment discontinuation during the first year of aromatase inhibitor
(AI) therapy according to the number of symptoms present before AI initiation and patient characteristics (n 5 447; area under the curve 5 0.64).

more parsimonious model using a stepwise approach.
Thus, we evaluated a model that included age, AI medication, sleep quality, and concentration (Table 2). E1S at
baseline (P 5 .14) and pain score (P 5 .12) were the last
variables to be removed from the model. With all 5 variables included, the area under the curve (a measure of predictive power in logistic regression) was 0.68. In either the
full model or the reduced model (which excluded E1S
and pain score), both poor sleep quality and difficulty
concentrating remained statistically significant. In the
reduced model detailed in Table 2, those with poor sleep
quality had 1.79 times the odds of discontinuing AI medication by the end of the first year of treatment, holding
age, AI medication, and concentration severity constant
(P 5 .01). Those with moderate-to-extreme difficulty
concentrating had 2.62 times the odds of discontinuing
treatment, holding all other variables constant (P 5 .017).
The area under the curve of this reduced model was 0.65.
A second model was evaluated to specifically analyze
the effect of total number of symptoms at baseline (3-5
symptoms vs 0-2 symptoms) (Table 3). In this model, age
(OR, 0.97; P 5 .03), AI medication (OR, 1.66; P 5 .02),
and 3 symptoms (OR, 1.68; P 5 .03) had statistically
significant associations with treatment discontinuation
caused by to toxicity. This model also included a pain
score (measured on a visual analog scale) in which each
1-point increase in pain increased the odds of discontinuation by 1.09 (P 5 .07). This model had an area under the
curve of 0.64. When baseline E1S (P 5 .17) was also
included in this base model, the area under the curve
increased slightly to 0.65.
DISCUSSION
Early discontinuation of AI therapy, which is associated
with worse breast cancer outcomes, is frequently caused

by the development of side effects, especially musculoskeletal toxicity.3,5 Numerous previous studies of AI therapy
have reported an increased risk of developing musculoskeletal symptoms during AI treatment for factors such as
age, body mass index, pre-existing pain or arthritis, prior
chemotherapy, and prior tamoxifen.3,6-8 For the current
analysis, instead, we focused on associations between
patient-reported nonpain symptoms that were present
before the initiation of AI therapy, such as poor sleep
quality, fatigue, depression, and anxiety, and increased
rates of premature treatment discontinuation because of
toxicity. In the relatively large ELPh trial, we observed
that pre-existing poor sleep quality and difficulty concentrating were strongly associated with early treatment discontinuation because of toxicity. In addition, increased
symptom burden before AI therapy initiation was associated with both increased symptom burden during AI
treatment and increased likelihood of treatment discontinuation within 1 year.
Our findings are consistent with those reported in
the MA.27 trial of exemestane versus anastrozole.26 In
that study, the hazard ratio of early treatment discontinuation because of bother from side effects from previous
treatment that were present at the time of AI initiation
was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.08-1.55; P 5 .006). The contributions of specific side effects were not described.
The symptom cluster of mood disorders, fatigue,
and difficulty sleeping is frequently identified in patients
across diseases, including cancer and chronic pain syndromes.27 Many of the published reports evaluating
symptom clusters in breast cancer patients have focused
on patients undergoing therapy with short-term treatment
modalities, including chemotherapy and=or radiation
therapy. For example, in 1 study, patients who reported a
greater number of symptoms before the start of chemotherapy were more likely to report worse symptoms during the treatment.27 Other studies have identified specific
patterns of change in symptoms over time during chemotherapy and radiation. These patterns ultimately impact
functional status and quality of life, and they may influence patient management.17,28 In contrast, few published
reports have focused on patterns of specific symptoms
that occur during long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy.
Analogous to what has been observed previously with
chemotherapy, in the ELPh trial, we identified an association between a greater number of symptoms before treatment and decreased persistence with AI therapy because
of toxicity. The symptoms of poor sleep and difficulty
concentrating stood out as clinically important contributors to this symptom cluster.

Knowledge of these associations is clinically relevant,
because these symptoms are not frequently recognized as
problematic and are not typically carefully assessed or
aggressively managed by oncologists. Indeed, because difficulty sleeping and complaints of fatigue are common
among patients with breast cancer29 and often are believed
to be self-limited side effects of prior therapies, including
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, oncologists may not
appreciate that the presence of these symptoms could compromise future treatments. These results raise the possibility
that asking patients about these symptoms and addressing
them at the time of AI initiation, or even prophylactically,
could identify patients at risk and allow the implementation of measures to improve adherence=persistence with
subsequent adjuvant endocrine therapy.
Although the management of these symptoms is
essential for improving quality of life, the current data
suggest that it may also have an impact on breast cancer
outcomes if improvement in symptoms leads to increased
adherence to and persistence with therapy. There is a paucity of effective treatment options for poor sleep, cognitive
problems, and fatigue among cancer survivors. Numerous
clinical trials have been conducted to test various pharmacologic therapies for fatigue, although few studies of pharmacologic treatments have been conducted specifically for
sleep disturbance in cancer patients.18 Meta-analyses have
demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from methylphenidate compared with placebo for cancer-related fatigue, although the clinical benefit is modest.30 There are
also considerable data supporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for treatment of both insomnia and fatigue in cancer patients.30-32 The use of cognitive
behavioral therapy is recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of cancer-related fatigue,33 although it is unknown
how often these behavioral techniques are actually used in
clinical practice. Improvements in fatigue have also been
noted in patients with cancer who received other nonpharmacologic interventions, including physical activity.30 Although several treatment options are listed in the
currently available national guidelines, no individual modality is preferred.33
Our study has multiple strengths. The findings were
derived from a large, prospective clinical trial in which
reasons for discontinuation were prospectively recorded.
Validated questionnaires were used to assess patientreported sleep, pain, and mood disorders, although
fatigue and cognitive function data elements had to be
obtained from a more general symptom questionnaire.

study, so cost of the medication was not a factor in persistence with therapy.
In this analysis, we identified a numerically greater
but not statistically significant increased risk of treatment
discontinuation within 1 year among patients who
received a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen, which we
and others have previously reported. One important difference between the prior analysis of the ELPh trial and
the current report is the focus on discontinuation specifically within the first year of AI therapy. This 1-year limitation was intended to restrict analyses to the symptoms
likely caused by the AI medication and less likely caused
by changes that can occur over time with the natural aging
process, such as worsening osteoarthritis. Our findings
suggest that pre-existing symptoms are more strongly
associated with AI discontinuation because of toxicity
than clinical factors, such as prior chemotherapy. However, it remains possible that prior treatments like chemotherapy contributed to the symptoms reported by patients
at the time of their baseline study visit.
Our findings demonstrate the importance of symptom clusters that include poor sleep and difficulty concentrating in patients with breast cancer and the potential
detrimental effects of these symptoms not just on quality
of life but also on AI treatment adherence and breast cancer outcomes. Therapies to improve the constellation of
symptoms rather than those that target individual symptoms should be considered to allow optimal patient care.
Clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the impact of the
management of symptom clusters on adherence to potentially life-saving adjuvant endocrine therapies.
