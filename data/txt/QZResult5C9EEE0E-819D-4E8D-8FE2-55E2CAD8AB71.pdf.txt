ABSTRACT
Esophageal cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer mortality in the world. Due
to the increased drug and radiation tolerance, it is urgent to develop novel anticancer
agent that triggers nonapoptotic cell death to compensate for apoptosis resistance.
In this study, we show that treatment with gypenoside L (Gyp-L), a saponin isolated
from Gynostemma pentaphyllum, induced nonapoptotic, lysosome-associated cell
death in human esophageal cancer cells. Gyp-L-induced cell death was associated with
lysosomal swelling and autophagic flux inhibition. Mechanistic investigations revealed
that through increasing the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS),
Gyp-L triggered protein ubiquitination and endoplasm reticulum (ER) stress response,
leading to Ca2+ release from ER inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-operated stores
and finally cell death. Interestingly, there existed a reciprocal positive-regulatory
loop between Ca2+ release and ER stress in response to Gyp-L. In addition, protein
synthesis was critical for Gyp-L-mediated ER stress and cell death. Taken together,
this work suggested a novel therapeutic option by Gyp-L through the induction of an
unconventional ROS-ER-Ca2+-mediated cell death in human esophageal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Autophagy plays an important role in cancer
development and therapy [4]. Tumor cells usurp autophagy
to enhance their metastasis and survival in metabolic
stress such as DNA damage and hypoxia [5–7]. Besides,
autophagy is one of the mechanisms by which tumor
cells acquire therapy resistance [8–10]. Indeed, several
reports have demonstrated that inhibiting autophagic
flux significantly induces cell death or enhances the
sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents
[11–13]. Therefore, inhibition of autophagy pathway is an
alternative strategy for cancer therapy [14].

Esophageal cancer is the fifth leading cause
of cancer death for male and eighth for female in
developing countries [1]. The current therapeutic
treatments are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery
and combinations of them [2, 3]. However, due to the
poor diagnosis at an early phase, high recurrence of drug
and radiation tolerance, developing novel and efficient
chemotherapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment
of esophageal cancer is emergently required.

Natural products are the important resources for
drugs discovery of cancer therapy [15]. Gynostemma
pentaphyllum, also known as “South ginseng” in china,
has been extensively used in traditional human medicine
or tea in Asia. Gypenosides (Gyp), saponins extracted from
G. pentaphyllum, have shown a wide range of beneﬁcial
biological activities such as cholesterol-lowering,
hypoglycemic, antioxidant and immune-potentiating
effects [16–19]. Besides, fewer reports have described the
anti-tumor activity of Gyp [20–22]. However, the specific
functional component of Gyp and the detailed mechanism
remain unclear.
In this study, we identified Gypenoside L (Gyp-L)
(Figure 1A), a saponin isolated from Gyp (Supplementary
Figure S1), possessing the anticancer activity in human
esophageal cancer cells. Gyp-L was able to inhibit
the growth of esophageal cancer cells, which was
accompanied by lysosomal swelling and a halt in the
execution of autophagy at the stage of autophagosomelysosome fusion. Mechanically, Gyp-L-induced cell
death required ROS-mediated unfolded protein response
(UPR), and subsequently ER Ca2+ release. These results
suggested Gyp-L as a novel therapeutic agent to induce
an unconventional cell death in human esophageal cancer.

lysosomes. Through fluorescence microscopy assay using
Lyso-Tracker Red, we also found that Gyp-L-induced
vacuoles were colocalized with lysosomes (Supplementary
Figure S2B). Following Gyp-L treatment, small lysosomes
fused with each other and the sizes of the vacuoles
increased largely (Figure 2B). Additionally, electron
microscopic analysis showed that the ECA-109 cells
treated with Gyp-L contained large vacuoles (Figure 2C),
and higher magnification electron micrographs clearly
showed the presence of partially degraded cytoplasmic
materials in the vacuoles (Figure 2C, right panel). Due
to the progressive vacuolar swelling upon treatment with
Gyp-L, the nuclear size of ECA-109 or TE-1 cells was
reduced by > 40% within 12 h (Figure 2D). In addition,
although the LysoTracker signal as well as the level of
red ﬂuorescence of acridine orange (AO)-stained cells
increased over the ﬁrst 6 h of treatment with Gyp-L, the
signal intensity of both dyes was decreased after 24 h of
treatment. All the large vacuoles lost their red acridine
orange signal (Supplementary Figure S2C), indicating that
these dilated lysosomes lost functionality. Taken together,
these results indicated that Gyp-L-induced swelling and
dysfunction of lysosomes correlated with loss in cell
viability

Gyp-L-induced cell death is apoptosisindependent

Gyp-L induces cell death in human esophageal
cancer cells

To gain insight into the nature of Gyp-L-induced
cell death, we examined the ratio of apoptosis using flow
cytometry after Annexin V /PI double staining. As shown in
Figure 3A, Gyp-L barely induced apoptosis, as most of the
dead cells belonging to necrosis or other types of cell death.
We then applied the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
(Z-VAD) to Gyp-L treatments. Inclusion of Z-VAD-FMK
in a non-cytotoxic concentration significantly inhibited
caspase activity (Supplementary Figure S3A). However,
Z-VAD-FMK prevented neither Gyp-L-medicated cell
death (Figure 3B) nor cytoplasmic vacuolation (Figure 3C).
In contrast, treatment with Z-VAD-FMK enhanced Gyp-Linduced cell death, suggesting that Z-VAD-FMK switches
more apoptotic-liked cell death to Gyp-L-mediated cell
death. Moreover, no cleaved-PARP, Caspase-3 or Caspase-9
were detected by western blot (data not shown). In addition,
we measured mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1
staining. We found that no changes occurred when ECA109 cells were treated with Gyp-L for 24 h (Supplementary
Figure S3B), further suggesting that Gyp-L induced cell
death is apoptosis-independent. Furthermore, we assessed
the effect of Necrostatin-1 (NEC), a necrosis inhibitor, on
Gyp-L cytotoxicity. Unlike apoptosis, loss of necroptosis
provided partial rescue of cell viability with Gyp-L
treatment (Figure  3D). Moreover, cell cycle distribution
was monitored using flow cytometry. Essentially, treatment
with Gyp-L resulted in the accumulation of cells in the
G2/M phase, with a concomitant reduction in the proportion

To investigate the cytotoxicity of Gyp-L on human
esophageal cancer cells, ECA-109 and TE-1 cells were
treated with various concentrations of Gyp-L for 24 h,
48 h, 72 h and cell viability was determined by MTT assay
(Figure 1B). Gyp-L exhibited potent growth inhibitory
effect on both cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner. Besides, treatment with Gyp-L showed a
significant increase in cell death, when it was measured by
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (Figure 1C).
On the contrary, no cell death-inducing effect of Gyp-L
on normal cells (HUVEC) or normal esophageal epithelial
cells (HEEpiC) was observed (Figure 1D).

Gyp-L induces cytoplasmic vacuolation and
lysosomal swelling and fusion
The morphological changes were visualized and
Gyp-L induced extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation, which
affected ~95% of cells after 24 h (Figure 2A). Typically,
the numbers of vacuoles reduced and the sizes increased at
higher concentration. The vacuolated cells showed an intact
nucleus, shrined at later time points and underwent cell
death. Interestingly, lysosomal membrane marker LAMP1GFP was found to localize at the edge of the cytoplasmic
vacuoles (Supplementary Figure  S2A and Figure  2B),
indicating that these vacuoles were hypertrophic

interesting to investigate the contribution of the hindered
cell cycle progression to Gyp-L-induced cell death.

studies, unexpectedly did not affect Gyp-L-mediated
LC3-II accumulation (Supplementary Figure  S4B),
cytoplasmic vacuolation (Supplementary Figure S4C), as
well as cell death (Supplementary Figure S4D). Previous
studies have demonstrated that 3-MA could inhibit both
class III and class I PtdIns3-kinase and exhibited a dual
role in modulation of autophagy (induction or inhibition)
[23, 24]. Additionally, the synergism between 3-MA
and chemotherapeutic drugs in esophageal cancer cells
seems to be independent of autophagy [25]. Therefore
caution should be exercised in the application of 3-MA in
cancer combinatory study. Together, these above findings
suggested that Gyp-L-induced cytotoxicity depends on the
autophagic pathway.

Gyp-L regulates autophagy
Based on the progressive vacuoles formation
and dysfunction of lysosome, it is easy to envision that
autophagy process is interrupted. We therefore examined
the effect of Gyp-L on autophagy. Gyp-L augmented the
level of endogenous LC3-II in a time-dependent manner in
ECA-109 cells (Figure 4A). The accumulation of LC3-II
induced by Gyp-L was also observed in a dose-dependent
manner in both ECA-109 and TE-1 cells (Figure 4B).
We further used ECA-109 cells transiently expressing
GFP-tagged LC3 to confirm the autophagy modulatory
effect of Gyp-L (Figure 4C). Apparently, Gyp-L induced
a GFP-LC3 puncta increase and the number of puncta
per cell was largely increased after a longer incubation
with Gyp-L. Next siRNAs targeting autophagy-related
genes were used to investigate the role of autophagy in
Gyp-L-induced cell death (Supplementary Figure 4D).
Suppression of autophagy by knockdown of ATG5,
ATG7 or LC3 in ECA-109 cells significantly attenuated
Gyp-L-induced cell death (Figure 4D and Supplementary
Figure S4A). Finally, inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA
(10 mM), a class III PtdIns3-kinase inhibitor that has been
widely used as a pharmacological inhibitor in autophagy

Gyp-L inhibits autophagic flux
The increment of GFP-LC3 puncta or LC3-II
level may results from the increased autophagosomes
generation or the blockage of autophagosome-lysosome
fusion process. However, the progressive vacuolation and
lysosomal swelling upon Gyp-L treatment suggested that
autophagy may be halted at the stage of autophagosomallysosomal fusion. To explore this possibility further, we
performed an autophagic flux assay by measuring the total
cellular amount of p62 to distinguish Gyp-L-mediated
LC3 increment. p62 is degraded by lysosomal enzymes
after autophagosome fuses with lysosome. As p62 is

by MTT assay. Data are the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. (C) ECA-109 and TE-1 cells were treated with Gyp-L

an autophagy substrate, increased autophagy levels are
associated with p62 clearance. Consistently, immunoblot
analysis showed that a remarkable increase of p62 was
induced by Gyp-L in a time- and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 5A). Adding of chloroquine (CQ), an autophagic
inhibitor that can significantly increase the amount
of LC3-II and p62 [26], not significantly enhanced
the accumulation of p62 (Figure 5B), as well as GFPLC3 puncta induced by Gyp-L (Figure 5C). Except
for p62-mediated protein degradation in autophagy,
malfunctioning mitochondria is also selectively targeted
for autophagic degradation. According to this, we
suspected whether impaired autophagic flux by Gyp-L
may interrupt mitochondrial homeostasis. Actually, we
used Mito-Tracker Green to measure mitochondrial mass

and found a significant increase in Mito-Tracker Green
fluorescence in both cells after 12 h exposure of Gyp-L
(Supplementary Figure S5A). Together, these findings
suggest that autophagy flux is inhibited by Gyp-L.
Following this, we explored if autophagosome-lysosome
fusion was impaired. To do this, tfLC3, a novel reporter
protein (a chimeric LC3 protein fused tandemly with
mRFP and GFP, mRFP-GFP-LC3), was used to monitor
the autophagy process during Gyp-L treatment. GFP and
RFP exhibit differing pH sensitivity, wherein GFP is
quantitatively quenched in acidic compartments while RFP
is stable. Therefore tfLC3 develops yellow dots (GFPpositive/RFP-positive) when localized to autophagosomes,
and develops red dots (GFP-negative/RFP-positive) when
localized to autolysosomes. As shown in Figure 5D, the

Gyp-L significantly up-regulated the expression of RAB5,
whereas no change was occurred with the expression
of other genes (Supplementary Figure  S5C). However,
western blot assay showed that the protein level of RAB5
did not affected by Gyp-L (Supplementary Figure S5D).
Besides, knockdown of RAB5 using siRNA has no effect
on Gyp-L-induced cell death (Supplementary Figure S5E).

number of yellow and red puncta increased in Rapamycintreated cells, indicating that autophagic flux had increased.
In the presence of Gyp-L, we observed an enhanced
formation of yellow puncta without any significant
increase in the number of red puncta, as well as CQtreated cells. Additionally, the proteins LAMP2 and LC3B
also did not colocalize in Gyp-L-treated cells, indicative
of an arrest in the autophagic process at the stage of
autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Figure 5E). Therefore,
these above results clearly suggested that Gyp-L blocks
the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.
More importantly, CQ enhanced the cytotoxicity
of Gyp-L on all esophageal cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure S5B), suggesting that CQ and Gyp-L might have
different mechanisms to impair the autophagosomelysosome fusion process. Furthermore, we analyzed
the mRNA expression of several lysosomal positioning
proteins that have been demonstrated to regulate
autophagysosome-lysosome fusion, including RAB5,
RAB7, RAB11 and HDAC6 [27–29]. Treatment with

Upregulation of protein ubiquitination and ER
stress by Gyp-L
To understand the central mechanism through
which Gyp-L inhibits autophagic flux and induces
lysosome-associated cell death, we analyzed the possible
role for ER stress in Gyp-L-promoted cell death.
Since the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins
is a characteristic of ER stress, we first assessed the
level of total polyubiquitinated proteins. Western blot
analysis showed that Gyp-L increased polyubiquitinated
protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner

(Figure 6A). To mitigate the accumulation of unfolded
or misfolded proteins, stressed cells may activate a
homeostatic intracellular signaling network cumulatively,
the UPR pathway, to orchestrate the recuperation of ER
function. As expected, the protein levels of several UPR
associated proteins were largely increased in a time and
dose-dependent way after Gyp-L treatment (Figure 6B).
In addition, TUDCA, an specific ER stress inhibitor,
significantly reduced Gyp-L-mediated activation of
UPR (Figure 6C) and LC3-II accumulation (Figure 6D).
Consistently, TUDCA apparently attenuated Gyp-Lmediated cell death in both ECA-109 cells and TE-1 cells
(Figure 6E). These results indicated that ER stress plays a
crucial role in Gyp-L-induced autophagic flux inhibition
and cell death of esophageal cancer cells.
Furthermore, we examined the selectivity of
Gyp-L and tested whether Gyp-L induced ER stress
in normal esophageal epithelial cells. To our surprise,
although Gyp-L induced cytoplasmic vacuolation in
higher concentration in HEEpiC cells, only limited
cells had vacuole formation and the percentage of cell
with vacuoles was largely reduced (Supplementary
Figure S6A). Besides, Gyp-L failed to significant induce
the accumulation of LC3-II and p62 (Supplementary
Figure S6B). Gyp-L also failed to activate ER stress in
HEEpiC cells (Supplementary Figure S6C). Together,

these results suggested that Gyp-L exhibits selectivity
toward cancer cells to stimulate non-apoptotic cell death.

ER calcium release potentiates the ER stress and
cell death caused by Gyp-L
ER stress is accompanied by alteration in Ca2+
homeostasis, and the ER Ca2+ store depletion by itself
can induce ER stress and cell death [30]. We next sought
to investigate whether Gyp-L perturbed intracellular
Ca2+ homeostasis. ECA-109 cells were challenged with
different concentrations of Gyp-L for 12 h or 24 h, and
stained with Ca2+ specific indicator Furo-4/AM. Indeed,
incubation with Gyp-L dramatically increased the
intracellular Ca2+ levels (Figure 7A). An examination of
the functional significance of this increase in Ca2+ levels
showed that BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable acetoxymethyl
ester of the Ca2+ scavenger, inhibited Gyp-L-induced
LC3-II accumulation (Figure  7B) and UPR activation
(Figure 7C), suggesting that the increase in intracellular
Ca2+ levels is critically associated with ER stress and
cell death. Surprisingly, inhibiting ER stress by TUDCA
apparently reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentration
(Figure 7D), giving a hint that ER stress triggers the Ca2+
increment. Therefore, there existed a positive interplay
between Ca2+ and ER stress.

experiment. Scale bar: 20 μm. (D) Knockdown of autophagy-related genes prevented Gyp-L-induced cell death. ECA-109 cells were

for another 24 h. Cell viability were determined by MTT assay and western blot result showed the knockdown efficacy. Data presented are
representative of three independent experiments.

Next, we explored the sources of the increased
intracellular Ca2+ following Gyp-L treatment. The ER is
a major reservoir of intracellular Ca2+ and several Ca2+
channels, including inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor
(IP3R) and Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase
(SERCA), control the efflux or influx of Ca2+ [30, 31].
Release of Ca2+ from the ER is mainly via IP3R while
SERCA transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen
of the ER at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Firstly, we
found that treatment with Gyp-L significantly reduced the
mRNA expression of SERCA, whereas IP3R expression
was largely increased (Figure 7E), indicating that IP3R
may be responsible for Gyp-L-mediated intracellular Ca2+
increment. Then we used 2-APB, a selective inhibitor of
IP3Rs, to investigate the role of IP3R in Ca2+ signaling.
We found that pretreatment with 2-APB significantly
decreased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Figure 7F),

and inhibited Gyp-L-induced LC3-II accumulation
(Figure 7G), UPR activation (Figure 7H) and cell death
(Figure 7I). Collectively, these results suggested that Ca2+
release from IP3R-operated stores potentiates the ER stress
and contributes to Gyp-L-induced cell death in esophageal
cancer cells.

Gyp-L-induced ER stress and cell death requires
new protein synthesis
Overload of protein in the ER-lumen could lead to
the ER stress and subsequent cell death, thus we argued
that abrogating synthesis of protein could exert a contrary
role. Indeed, preventing protein synthesis by addition of
cycloheximide (CHX) inhibited Gyp-L-induced ER stress
in ECA-109 cells and TE-1 cells (Figure 8A). Treatment
with CHX also significantly attenuated Gyp-L-induced

protein ubiquitination (Figure 8B). In addition, CHX
prevented LC3-II and p62 accumulation (Figure 8C), as
well as Gyp-L-induced cell death (Figure 8D). These results
revealed that Gyp-L-induced extensive misfolding of new
synthesized proteins lead to ER stress and cell death.

reduced. (Supplementary Figure  S7 and Figure 9E).
Consequently, NAC pretreatment significantly ameliorated
Gyp-L-mediated reduction in cell viability (Figure 9F).
Furthermore, we tested the effects of other ROS scavengers,
including TEMPOL, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, and
Trolox, a vitamin E analog, on Gyp-L-induced cytoplasmic
vacuolation and cell death. Surprisingly, only TEMPOL was
capable to block Gyp-L-induced cell death (Figure 9G),
Ca2+ release (Figure 9G) and cytoplasmic vacuolation
(Supplementary Figure S7). Further works are required to
investigate the different effects of TEMPOL and Trolox.
Finally, overexpression of LC3 attenuated NAC-mediated
cell death inhibition (Figure 9I). Taken together, these
findings all clearly indicated that ROS generation acts
as a upstream to trigger Gyp-L-induced ER stress and
subsequent Ca2+ homeostasis and cell death.

ROS generation critically contributes to the ER
stress and cell death
It has previously been shown that ROS is involved in
ER stress and cell death [32–34]. In order to further test this,
we next examined whether Gyp-L also generates ROS in
esophageal cancer cells and, if so, whether this contributes
to the ER stress and subsequent cell death. Flow cytometry
using a ROS fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA) demonstrated that production of ROS
was markedly increased after treatment with Gyp-L for 4 h
(Supplementary Figure 9A). Consistently, pretreating the
cells with NAC, a ROS scavenger, significantly decreased
the production of ROS (Figure 9B). In addition, NAC
pretreatment reversed Gyp-L-induced increment of
several ER stress proteins (Figure 9C) and the intracellular
Ca2+ concentration (Figure  9D). Vacuole formation
and accumulation of LC3-II and p62 were also clearly

DISCUSSION
In the present work, we show that Gyp-L inhibits
autophagic flux and induces nonapoptotic, lysosomeassociated cell death in human esophageal cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S8). Exposure to Gyp-L was
characterized by lysosomal swelling, autophagosome

by Piao et al. has simply explored the anticancer activity
of Gyp-L in human lung cancer cells [37]. However, the
precise mechanism of Gyp-L-induced cell death have not
been clearly determined. Herein we provided evidence
that Gyp-L-induced cell death correlated with an increase
in levels of autophagosomes in human esophageal cancer
cells. In line with this, silencing of autophagy-related
genes (ATG5, ATG7 and LC3) protected against Gyp-L
cytotoxicity (Figure 4D). However, treatment of Gyp-L
resulted in a halt of the execution of autophagy at the stage
of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to hallmark

formation and halted autophagosome-lysosome fusion,
ultimately leading to cell death. More detailed studies
found that Gyp-L initially stimulated the generation of
ROS, which subsequently triggered ER stress and Ca2+
release from IP3R-operated stores. Our data provide a
preliminary insight into the possible use of Gyp-L as an
anticancer drug for esophageal cancer therapy.
Compounds from natural plants are important
sources for cancer therapeutic drug discovery. Gyp-L
has been demonstrated to act as a potential activators of
AMP-activated protein kinase [35, 36]. Previous study

accumulation of LC3B-II and p62 (Figure 5). Currently,
disruption of the late stages of autophagy might lead to
excessive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles containing
deleterious undegraded material, which have the potential
to turn autophagy into a destructive process [38, 39].
Such inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion has
previously been reported for the lysosomal inhibitor
CQ, leading to vacuolization and lysosomal swelling as
identiﬁed here for Gyp-L [40]. Therefore, Gyp-L seems to
act as a lysosomal inhibitor to exert its anticancer activity
by inhibiting the autophagic degradation of cytotoxic and
deleterious materials.
Besides, Gyp-L-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation
associated with increased LC3-II accumulation is similar
to previous descriptions in colon, breast, glioblastoma
cancer cell lines and mantle cell lymphoma [41–43].
However, in those studies large vacuoles derived from
ER and mitochondrial whereas Gyp-L-induced vacuoles
belonged to lysosomes. Besides, different signaling
pathways were involved in cytoplasmic vacuolation and
types of cell death were described inconsistently. For
example, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor-induced
vacuolation showed to be mediated by the MAPK
cascade and sensitive to the MEK inhibitor [44, 45].
15d-PGJ2-induced vacuoles formation was mediated by
both the MEK-1 and -2 cascades [41]. We showed here

that Gyp-L treatment triggered the generation of ROS
and UPR response. This process has also been observed
to be associated with cytoplasmic vacuole formation
and with enhanced antitumor activity [46]. Compared to
normal cells, cancer cells appears to be a defect in their
ability to eliminate Gyp-L-induced misfolded proteins as
evident from the absence of activated ER stress in normal
epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure S6C). These defects
ultimately led to the accumulation of misfolded protein
aggregates and novel non-apoptotic death. Moreover,
treatment with Gyp-L did not negatively affect primary
culture of normal epithelial cells. This differential
sensitivity of normal versus malignant epithelial cells to
Gyp-L provides a promising therapeutic window.
In addition, we showed that Gyp-L-induced ER
stress triggered the release of Ca2+ from the ER, which was
consistent with previous reports [47]. Indeed, intracellular
Ca2+ chelating agent BAPTA-AM attenuated Gyp-Linduced UPR activation (Figure 7C), as well as Gyp-Linduced autophagic flux inhibition (Figure 7B). This result
was further supported by the observation that following ER
stress, BAPTA-AM could block autophagy flux induced
by proteasome inhibitors [48]. One possible explanation
is that depletion of cytosolic Ca2+ might interrupt the
lysosomal function essential for complete autophagy flux
[48]. Interestingly, the ER-Ca2+ -mediated autophagic flux

inhibition was similar with the effect of thapsigargin, a
SERCA agonist that depletes ER Ca2+ reservoir [49–51].
Treatment with thapsigargin increased intracellular Ca2+,
which in turn, blocked autophagy flux at the end stage by
inhibiting the fusion of matured autophagosomes with
lysosomes [50], or by preventing the closure of elongating
phagophores [51]. It is therefore interesting to test the
effect of Gyp-L on lysosome maturation and elongation.
Together, these findings strongly suggest that autophagic

flux inhibition is predominantly a consequence of ER-Ca2+
perturbation.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that Gyp-L
induced a nonapoptotic, lysosome-associated cell death
in human esophageal cancer cells through ROS-ERCa2+ signaling. Our data suggest that small chemicals
modulating autophagy and lysosomal function can serve
as an alternative therapeutic option in esophageal cancer
therapy, especially in apoptosis-resistant cancer treatment.

(TaKaRa). A real-time PCR assay was performed using a
Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR system. The results were
analyzed with CFX manager software (Bio-Rad). The
sequences of primer pairs were shown in supplementary
Table S1. Messenger RNA transcription levels were
standardized against house-keeping gene GAPDH.

Western blotting
Cells treated with Gyp-L in the presence or absence
of inhibitors for indicated times were harvested and lysed
in RIPA buffer (Beyotime, P0013B) containing 1 mM
PMSF. The lysates were normalized to equal amounts
of protein, and were separated by 6–15% gradient SDSPAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane,
the proteins were probed with the indicated primary
antibodies. Detection was conducted by incubation with
species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL blotting
detection reagents (Thermo, 34080). GAPDH was used as
the loading control.

Cell viability and death assay
The cell viability of chemical inhibitors and
siRNA were determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide
(MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, M2128) assay. In brief, cells
were cultured in each well of 96-well plates with
varying concentrations of drugs for 24  h, 48 h or
72 h. Following incubation with MTT (0.5 mg/ml)
for 4 h, the supernatant of each well was discarded and
the insoluble formazan product was dissolved in 100 μl
DMSO. The optical density was measured at 570 nm,
with a reference wavelength of 630 nm, on a multiscanner
autoreader (M450, Bio-rad, USA). The OD570 in control
cells was taken as 100% viability. Cell death was assessed
by measuring LDH activity released into the culture
medium from damaged cells. LDH activity kit (Beyotime,
C0016) was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Unless otherwise specified, the effects of

system under a 40× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss).

Assays of cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial
membrane potential and mitochondrial mass
To determine the effects of Gyp-L on the cell
cycle distribution, ECA-109 cells were treated with
Gyp-L for 24 h, fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, and
stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma, P4170)
containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase and 5% Triton X-100 for
30 min at 37oC. The percentage of cells in different
phases of the cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometer
(BD FACSCalibur, USA) and inbuilt software. For
apoptosis analysis, the cells were incubated with
various concentrations of Gyp-L for 24  h, harvested,
washed, and resuspended in 500 μl of 1× binding buffer
containing Annexin V-FITC and PI (BD, 556547) for
10 min at room temperature. Mitochondrial membrane
potential and mass were evaluated using the probe JC-1
(Beyotime, C2005), or Mito-Tracker Green (Beyotime,
C1048), respectively. Briefly, esophageal cancer cells
in each group were harvested, washed twice with cold
PBS, centrifuged, and then stained with JC-1 (5 μg/ml)
or Mito-Tracker Green (200 nM) for 30 min at 37°C and
analyzed using flow cytometry.

Transmission electronic microscopy assay
ECA-109 cells were treated as indicated and were
fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde at 4°C overnight. After
dehydration, ultrathin sections were embedded and stained
with uranyl acetate/lead citrate. Images were captured
under a transmission electron microscope (Tencai G2 20,
Netherland).

Measurement of intracellular ROS or calcium
Cancer cells treated with indicated compounds
for 8 h were stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA (SigmaAldrich, D6883) for 30 min. Then ROS generation was
determined at 525 nm by flow cytometry. Intracellular
calcium concentration was measured by fluorescence
microscopy using specific probe Fluo-4/AM (Invitrogen,
F-14201). The cells treated with different concentrations
of Gyp-L were incubated with 5 μM Fluo-4/AM at 37oC
for 60  min and detected by fluorescence microscopy
(Nikon Ti-u). Software Image J was used to measure the
mean fluorescence intensity.
