nonclassic pathways of ER-mediated transcription as well as nongenomic roles of the ER have also been reported (1). Therefore,
although much remain to be understood about the regulation
of the ER, the original observation of its activation by binding to
estrogen has led to the development of antihormonal therapy for
the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers.
Tamoxifen was the first antiestrogen to be developed and has
been used for the management of ER-positive breast cancers over
the past three decades. Binding of both estrogen and tamoxifen
leads to conformational changes of the ER that result in the
recruitment of coactivators and corepressors; however, whereas
estrogen acts as an agonist whether AF1 or AF2 is dominant,
tamoxifen acts as a antagonist on AF2 but as an agonist on AF1. As
a result, tamoxifen can lead to repression or activation of estrogendependent genes depending on the cellular context and whether
AF1 or AF2 is dominant in this tissue. Because the presence of the
ER is essential for tamoxifen response, the ER status has been used
to identify breast cancer patients who are likely to benefit from
tamoxifen treatment. However, despite ER expression, some
tumors do not respond or develop resistance to tamoxifen (2, 3).
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the
resistance to tamoxifen, including change in uptake or metabolism
of tamoxifen, loss of expression of ER, expression of mutant or
variant forms of ER, loss of cofactors, modification of the estrogen
response element, and ligand-independent ER activation. In addition, because cyclin D1 binds and activates the ER in a ligandindependent manner and prevents its inhibition by tamoxifen
(4, 5), the overexpression of cyclin D1 may also contribute to tamoxifen resistance.
Cyclins act as the regulatory subunits of the cyclin-dependent
kinases (cdk). Binding of D-type cyclins to cdk4 and cdk6 leads to
the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), release of
the E2F family of transcription factors from Rb, which in turn
activates downstream targets of E2F required for the G1-S phase
transition and results in cellular proliferation (6, 7). In addition to
its original role as a cdk-dependent regulator of the cell cycle,
cyclin D1 also affects the activity of various transcription factors
in a cdk-independent manner including the ER (4, 5, 8–10).
Importantly, cyclin D1 not only interacts with the ER but also with
steroid receptor coactivators and P/CAF (11, 12). Therefore, by
binding to both the ER and its coactivators, cyclin D1 acts as a
bridging factor that recruits coactivators to the ER in the absence
of estrogen. This effect of cyclin D1 on the ER does not require
cdk binding by cyclin D1, because it can be recapitulated with a
cyclin D1 mutant that is unable to bind cdk4 (5). As cyclin D1 is
overexpressed in 35% of breast cancers and that cyclin D1
positivity is tightly linked to ER positivity, this observation has
led to the hypothesis that cyclin D1 overexpression may help
identify the subset of patients that do not benefit from tamoxifen
treatment.

Abstract
De novo or acquired resistance to tamoxifen is a major clinical
challenge for the management of estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancers. Although cyclin D1 overexpression is
associated with a better outcome for breast cancer patients,
its overexpression is also linked to tamoxifen resistance.
We previously reported that the beneficial effect of cyclin
D1 correlates with its ability to repress the antiapoptotic
transcription factor signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3). In contrast, molecular pathways
linking overexpression of cyclin D1 to tamoxifen resistance
have not been established. In the current study, the effect of
tamoxifen on the growth of genetically matched high or low
cyclin D1–expressing breast cancer cells was characterized
and the interactions between cyclin D1, ER, and STAT3 in
response to tamoxifen treatment were determined. We show
that repression of STAT3 by cyclin D1 inhibits cell growth on
Matrigel and in tumors in vivo; however, treatment with
tamoxifen abolishes cyclin D1–mediated repression of STAT3
and growth suppression. We show that tamoxifen induces a
redistribution of cyclin D1 from STAT3 to the ER, which
results in the activation of both STAT3 and the ER. These
results offer a molecular mechanism for the dual effect of
cyclin D1 overexpression in breast cancer and support the
notion that the level of cyclin D1 expression and activated
STAT3 are important markers to predict response to tamoxifen treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(3):852–60]

Introduction
Estrogen is required for the normal proliferation and differentiation of breast epithelial cells and is also implicated in the
development and progression of breast cancer. The estrogen
receptor (ER) is primarily a nuclear protein and the classic view is
that its activation involves the binding to estrogen and receptor
dimerization. The ER dimer then associates with coregulators,
binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of target genes,
which results in cell cycle progression (1). Ligand-independent
activity of the ER is also observed and results from phosphorylation of the ER (1). The transcription activity of the ER is mediated
by two domains, activation function 1 (AF1) and 2 (AF2). The
activities of AF1 and AF2 differ depending on the cell types and can
either be dominant or synergize with each other (1). In addition,

and the absorption at 570 nm was determined by Universal Micro plate
Reader ELX800 (BIOTEX Instrument, Inc.). The percentage of cell survival
was evaluated relative to that of untreated cells.
Quantitation of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cells were examined
morphologically after staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide.
Cells were trypsinized from Matrigel, and 4 AL stock solution containing
100 mg/mL acridine orange and 100 mg/mL ethidium bromide were added
to 100 AL of cell suspension. The numbers of total cells and apoptotic
cells that showed nuclear shrinkage and apoptotic bodies were counted.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated after counting a total of
1,500 cells.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Protein extracts
from cell lines were prepared by washing thrice in ice-cold PBS, followed
by lysis in 200 AL ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5),
250 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 50 mmol/L NaF, 0.2 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL pepstatin, 100 g/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol/L DTT]. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000  g
for 20 min at 4jC, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were
determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins (15 Ag) were
separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). Membranes were
incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti–cyclin D1 antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-STAT3 antibody (1:1,000; Zymed),
rabbit polyclonal anti–phospho-STAT3 antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERa (G-20) antibody (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (1:2,000;
Hybridoma Facility, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), and antigen-antibody
complexes were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). All experiments were performed at least twice. The intensity of the
bands was quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-800 densitometer equipped with
the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad).
To immunoprecipitate HA–cyclin D1, anti–HA-probe antibody (Y-11,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4jC
for 90 min. Protein A–Sepharose beads were added to the lysates and
incubation was continued overnight at 4jC. Protein A–Sepharose beads
were added to the lysates and incubation was continued overnight at 4jC.
Xenograft implantation and measurement of tumor size. Eight-weekold BALB/c nude mice were purchased from the Animal Research Center.
A pellet of 17-h-estradiol (0.72 mg/mL) and subsequently a tamoxifen pellet
(Innovative Research of America; 2.5 mg/pellet, 60 days release) were
inserted s.c. in the upper back of each mouse. To insert the pellets, mice
were anesthetized using ketamine and xylazine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg of
body weight. A small incision was made and the pellet was inserted using a
precision trochar. The incision was sealed using a clip. T47D or T47D-D1
cell pellets (1  107 cells) were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel
(Basement Membrane Matrix, BD Biosciences). The mixture was injected
s.c. in the lower back of each animal using a 26-gauge needle 1 week after
the insertion of the estrogen pellet. The estrogen pellets were kept throughout the experiment because the growth of T47D cells in mice is dependent
on estrogen and the removal of the pellet would lead to tumor regression
even in the absence of tamoxifen. Our protocol was approved by the animal
ethic committee at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Tumor size was measured using a digital caliper. Two independent
measurements (length and width) were taken for each tumor weekly and
their resulting average was used to obtain tumor volume.
Luciferase assay. T47D-D1 cells were plated in a 24-well plate 24 h before
transfection at a density of 3  104 cells/mL. Cells were transfected with a
vector expressing a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies
of STAT3 consensus binding sites linked to a thymidine kinase minimal
promoter, together with control pTK-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids
using the FuGENE 6 system. STAT3 plasmid was kindly provided by
Dr. Olivier Coqueret (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, France). After 24 h of
incubation, tamoxifen was added and incubated for an additional 24 h.
Luciferase activity was determined using a dual-luciferase reporter assay
system (Promega) and luminometer. Firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to the activity of Renilla luciferase and to obtain the relative
luciferase activity.

In agreement with this possibility, two recent clinical studies
have found a strong link between cyclin D1 overexpression and
resistance to tamoxifen (13, 14). First, in postmenopausal women,
high levels of cyclin D1 protein were found to promote resistance
to tamoxifen (13). Second, in premenopausal women, elevated
levels of cyclin D1 protein also abolished the beneficial effect of
tamoxifen on recurrence-free survival and further elevated levels of
cyclin D1 gene correlated with a 6.38-fold increase in relative risk
of breast cancer recurrence and a 5.34-fold increased in relative risk
of death following tamoxifen treatment (14). In contrast to the
adverse effect of tamoxifen treatment of cyclin D1–overexpressing
cancers, in the control group who did not receive tamoxifen,
elevated levels of cyclin D1 were found to be associated with a
better outcome in both studies (13, 14).
The beneficial effect of cyclin D1 overexpression on breast
cancer survival was also reported by several others groups (15–20).
Notably, a study using microarray analysis of cyclin D1 expression
reported that high cyclin D1 expression was associated with low
risk of local recurrence of breast cancer, whereas low expression
was associated with high risk (16). The other studies showed that
strong staining of cyclin D1 is associated with inverse tumor grade,
smaller tumor size, and improved relapse-free and overall survival
of breast cancer patients (18, 20). We recently reported that the
beneficial effect of cyclin D1 correlates with its ability to repress the
expression of the antiapoptotic transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; ref. 21). These results
suggest that cyclin D1 overexpression induces opposite effects
on breast cancer cell survival depending on whether tamoxifen
is given or not. We hypothesized that one possible explanation
for this opposite effect of cyclin D1 may be that tamoxifen alters
the interaction between cyclin D1/STAT3 and cyclin D1/ER. We
initiated this study to address this possibility and found that upon
tamoxifen treatment, cyclin D1 can no longer inhibit STAT3 and
that the resulting activation of STAT3 contributes to tamoxifen
resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagent, and transfection. Cells were grown in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin
(5 Ag/mL), and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). For depletion of
estrogen, cells were cultured in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, insulin (5 Ag/mL), and antibiotics.
Charcoal stripping of serum was carried out as follows: 1.25 g of activated
charcoal and 0.125 g of dextran (both from Sigma) were added to 500 mL
FBS, incubated at 55jC for 30 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min;
the resulting single-stripped serum was collected and the procedure was
repeated but with incubation at 37jC for 30 min, followed by centrifugation
and filter sterilization of the double-stripped serum.
Tamoxifen was purchased from Sigma. AG490 [a-Cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)N-benzylcinnamide] was purchased from Calbiochem.
Transient transfections were performed by lipofection using the FuGENE
6 system as described by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim).
Cell culture on Matrigel. Cells (5  103/mL to 1  104/mL) were plated
in 500 AL DMEM with 5% FBS and insulin (5 Ag/mL) in four-well plates that
had been precoated with 250 AL Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The medium
was replaced every 3 to 4 days.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
To determine the percentage of cell survival, T47D and T47D-D1 cells were
seeded at 3  104/mL in 24-well plates and then treated for indicated time
with or without drugs. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma) solution (50 AL of a 5 mg/mL solution in PBS) was
added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37jC. The
medium was then aspirated, the cells were lysed in 400 AL DMSO per well

Selection of tamoxifen-resistant clones. Tamoxifen-resistant T47D
clones were selected after f1 year of culture in phenol red–free RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS, insulin (5 Ag/mL), antibiotics, and 1 Amol/L of tamoxifen (Sigma).

colonies was analyzed (Fig. 1C). Forced expression of STAT3 in
HBL100-D1 cells resulted in the formation of larger colonies
compared with HBL100-D1 cells and, further, the cell survival was
increased (Fig. 1C). To quantify this effect, the number of surviving
cells in HBL100, HBL100-D1, and HBL100-D1 transfected with
STAT3 was determined by MTT assay. When the percentage of
surviving HBL100 cells was set at 100%, the survival of HBL100-D1
cells was reduced to 55% and forced expression of STAT3 in
HBL100-D1 rescued survival up to 90% (Fig. 1D). This result supports the hypothesis that overexpression of cyclin D1 inhibits cell
growth by repressing STAT3 expression and further supports our
previous findings (21).
Overexpression of cyclin D1 in ER-positive breast cancer
cells also promotes repression of STAT3 and inhibition of cell
growth. To further examine the beneficial effect of cyclin D1
overexpression, we created stable clones of the ER-positive breast
cancer cell line T47D overexpressing HA-tagged cyclin D1 (Fig. 2A).
In these clones, the levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 were
reduced (Fig. 2A) and consistent with a decrease in its transcriptional activity, endogenous cyclin D1 were also reduced because the promoter of cyclin D1 contains a STAT3-binding site
(22, 23). The growth rate of the four individual clones was then
compared with that of the parental cell line in vitro. We found
that when cells were grown in vitro, no significant difference in
the growth rate was observed between individual cyclin D1–
overexpressing clones or between the clones and the parental cell
lines (Fig. 2B). Because the highest expression of cyclin D1 was
observed in T47D-D1 clone no. 1, we selected this clone for further

Results
Cyclin D1–mediated repression of STAT3 is required for its
ability to repress growth of ER-negative cells on Matrigel. To
investigate the effect of cyclin D1 overexpression on cell growth, we
took advantage of our stable clone of the human ER-negative
breast cancer cell line HBL100 overexpressing HA-tagged cyclin D1
(HBL100-D1; ref. 21). Both HBL100 and HBL100-D1 were tested for
their ability to form colonies on Matrigel. HBL100 cells formed
large and elongated colonies, whereas HBL100-D1 cells formed
smaller, rounder colonies characterized by the presence of increased number of floating cells (Fig. 1A). This effect was due to
increased apoptosis as the percentage of apoptosis in HBL100
cells was 5.3%, whereas it increased to 23.7% in HBL100-D1 cells
(Fig. 1A). We previously reported that the beneficial effect of cyclin
D1–overexpressing cells was correlated with the repression of the
transcription factor STAT3 (21). Consistent with this observation,
in HBL100-D1 cells, STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 levels were low
compared with HBL-100 parental cell line (Fig. 1B). To determine
whether the growth suppression in cyclin D1–overexpressing cells
on Matrigel is due to reduced levels of STAT3, HBL100-D1 cells
were transiently transfected with a plasmid where STAT3 is under
the control of a constitutive promoter and the morphology of the

HBL100 and HBL100 cells stably transfected with
the plasmid expressing cyclin D1HA (HBL100-D1)
were cultured on Matrigel for 2 wk, and
representative photomicrographs were taken. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined
using a fluorescence microscope after staining
with acridine orange and ethidium bromide.
B, HBL100 and HBL100-D1 cells were harvested
and proteins were extracted. Levels of cyclin D1,
STAT3, and phospho-STAT3 were determined by
Western blot analysis using anti-cyclin D1,
anti-STAT3, and anti–phospho-STAT3 antibodies,
respectively. Anti–a-tubulin antibody was used as
a loading control. C, HBL100-D1 cells were
transiently transfected with or without a plasmid
expressing STAT3. Cells were then plated on
Matrigel and representative photomicrographs
were taken at 10 d. D, HBL100, HBL100-D1, and
HBL100-D1 transfected with STAT3 were plated
on Matrigel and allowed to grow for 10 d. Cells
were harvested and cell number was determined
by MTT assay. Transfection of STAT3 was
confirmed by Western blot analysis using
anti-STAT3 antibody.

represses cell growth in vivo but not in vitro in
ER-positive cells. A, T47D cells and four
independent clones of T47D cells stably
expressing cyclin D1HA (T47D-D1) were
harvested and proteins were extracted. Levels
of cyclin D1, STAT3, and phospho-STAT3
were determined by Western blot analysis
using anti-cyclin D1, anti-STAT3, and
anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies, respectively.
B, T47D and four clones of T47D-D1 cells
were cultured for 1, 3, 6, and 9 d, and cell
numbers were determined at each time
point. Points , mean of three determinations.
C, nude mice (n = 15) were injected with
1  107 T47D or T47D-D1 cells. Tumor
growth was determined over a period of
9 wk as described in Materials and Methods.

were extracted from three individual

volume of T47D xenograft was 260 mm3, whereas at week 17, the
average tumor volume of T47D-D1 tumors was 550 mm3 (Fig. 3B).
As we observed that the growth of cyclin D1–overexpressing cells
on Matrigel inversely correlates with STAT3 levels (Fig. 1), at week
17, tumors were extracted and the levels of STAT3 were determined
in individual tumors. We found that STAT3 levels were consistently
elevated in T47D-D1 tumors treated with tamoxifen compared with
the level of STAT3 in T47D tumors (the average ratio of STAT3/
a-tubulin in T47D/T47D-D1 is 1:3.0; Fig. 3C). In the majority of
mice, the levels of phospho-STAT3 were also elevated (data not
shown). This observation suggests that tamoxifen treatment not
only abolishes the inhibitory effect of cyclin D1 on STAT3 but also
stimulates STAT3 expression. As these results indicate that
tamoxifen may stimulate the growth of cyclin D1 tumors, we next
compared the tumor growth rate of T47D-D1 cells with or without
tamoxifen treatment. Consistent with the clinical observation (14),
when the growth rate of T47D-D1 tumors between week 4 and 9 in
absence of tamoxifen was set at 100%, in comparison the relative
growth rate of tumor during the same period in presence of
tamoxifen treatment was increased to 170% (Fig. 3D). In addition,
the levels of STAT3 in the xenografts from tamoxifen-treated T47DD1 were elevated compared with that from untreated T47D-D1
(average ratio of STAT3/a-tubulin in untreated T47D-D1 versus
tamoxifen-treated T47D-D1 is 1:1.9; data not shown). These results
suggest that tamoxifen promotes tumor growth when cyclin D1 is
overexpressed possibly through STAT3 up-regulation.
Tamoxifen promotes the growth of cyclin D1–overexpressing cells by up-regulating STAT3. To further examine the growthpromoting effect of tamoxifen on cyclin D1–overexpressing cells,

study. T47D and T47D-D1 cells were injected in mice and their
ability to form tumor in vivo was compared. Tumor formation was
monitored by weekly size measurements over a period of 9 weeks.
Consistent with our previous observation (24), the tumor growth
rate in T47D-D1 showed a tendency to be slower compared with
parental T47D (Fig. 2C). To further study the mechanism of growth
suppression in cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors, STAT3 and
phospho-STAT3 levels were determined in three individual tumors
at week 9. We found that the levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3
were lower in T47D-D1 tumors compared with that in T47D
tumors (Fig. 2D). This result further supports the hypothesis that
overexpression of cyclin D1 inhibits cell growth by repressing
STAT3 expression and therefore contributes to the beneficial effect
of cyclin D1 on breast cancer survival.
Tamoxifen stimulates the growth of cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors in vivo. In premenopausal women, cyclin D1
overexpression was found to not only lead to tamoxifen resistance
but to actually increase the risk for disease recurrence (14). This
adverse effect of tamoxifen on cyclin D1–overexpressing cancers
suggests that tamoxifen may in fact promote the growth of these
tumors. We first tested whether this clinical observation can be
reproduced using our cell line model. T47D and T47D-D1 cells were
injected in mice and tumors were allowed to grow for 10 weeks.
At week 11, slow release tamoxifen pellets were inserted s.c. and
tumor formation was monitored for an additional 6 weeks. As
expected, tamoxifen treatment inhibited further growth of T47D
tumors; however, tamoxifen failed to inhibit the growth of T47D-D1
xenografts (Fig. 3A). At week 17, the distribution of individual
tumor volume was plotted and revealed that the average tumor

overexpressing cells and that this effect correlates with an increase
in STAT3 levels.
Tamoxifen promotes the redistribution of cyclin D1 from
STAT3 to the ER. Cyclin D1 binds to both the ER and STAT3;
however, cyclin D1 binding activates the ER whereas it represses
STAT3 (4, 5, 26). As tamoxifen treatment rescues the levels of
STAT3 in cyclin D1–overexpressing cells, one potential explanation
is that the conformational change of the ER upon tamoxifen
treatment may enhance its binding to cyclin D1 and as a result
sequester cyclin D1 away from STAT3 allowing its reactivation.
To test this possibility, T47D-D1 cells were treated with tamoxifen
and the association between cyclin D1 and the ER was tested by
immunoprecipitation following tamoxifen treatment. We found
that tamoxifen increased the interaction between cyclin D1 and the
ER (Fig. 5A, top). The levels of cyclin D1 following immunoprecipitation were not changed during treatment with tamoxifen (Fig. 5A,
middle). The increase in ER levels in the crude lysate following
tamoxifen was observed in both T47D and T47D-D1 cells (Fig. 5A,
bottom, and data not shown). However, when the activation of the
ER transcriptional activity was measured using an ERE-luciferase
reporter, the activity of the ER was only stimulated in the cyclin
D1–overexpressing cells and not in the T47D (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, no association between cyclin D1 and the ER was detected in
the T47D cells (data not shown). These results indicate that despite
the ability of tamoxifen to increase the level of the ER in both cell

T47D and T47D-D1 cells were treated with various concentrations
of tamoxifen in vitro for 7 days and the number of viable cells was
determined. In agreement with the results obtained in vivo,
tamoxifen at concentrations between 0.01 and 1 Amol/L stimulated
cell growth of T47D-D1 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, tamoxifen also
stimulated the growth T47D-D1-KE cells that overexpressed a
mutant form of cyclin D1 that cannot activate cdk4 (data not
shown), indicating that the effect is independent of cdk activation.
Further, when T47D-D1 cells were allowed to grow for 3 weeks on
Matrigel, the colonies formed by T47D-D1 treated with tamoxifen
were clearly larger than the colonies of the untreated control
(average ratio of the colony volume; control/tamoxifen 1:6.69;
Fig. 4B). Because STAT3 was found to be elevated in the T47D-D1
xenograft treated with tamoxifen (Fig. 3C), we also determined
the levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 in T47D-D1 cells treated
with tamoxifen and in agreement with the in vivo observation,
tamoxifen treatment led to an increase in STAT3 and also phosphoSTAT3 levels (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the growth-promoting
effect of tamoxifen is dependent on STAT3 activity, T47D-D1
cells were treated with or without tamoxifen and STAT3 inhibitor,
AG490. We found that upon treatment with AG490 at a concentration of 20 Amol/L, as expected AG490 led to a reduction in
cell growth (25) and further that the growth-promoting effect of
tamoxifen was also significantly abolished (Fig. 4D). These results
indicate that tamoxifen stimulates the growth of cyclin D1–

The average tumor volume in each group was
adjusted to 100 mm3 to allow for a direct comparison
of the two groups, and at week 10, tamoxifen
treatment was initiated. Tumor volumes were
determined over a total period of 17 wk. Statistical

Tamoxifen Inhibits Cyclin D1–Mediated STAT3 Repression

Figure 4. Tamoxifen up-regulates
STAT3 and leads to proliferation of cyclin
D1–overexpressing cells. A, T47D and
T47D-D1 cells were plated in a 24-well plate
(1.5  104 per well) and treated with
increasing concentrations of tamoxifen
for 7 d. The percentage of growth was
determined by MTT assay. Results are
presented as the mean from one
independent experiment performed in
triplicate. B, T47D-D1 cells were plated on
Matrigel (5  103 per well, four-well plate)
and cultured with or without 0.1 Amol/L
tamoxifen. The photomicrographs were
taken after 3 wk. C, T47D-D1 cells were
plated in 10-cm plate (1  105 per well)
and treated with increasing concentrations
of tamoxifen for 7 d. Proteins were
harvested and extracted to determine the
levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 by
Western analysis using anti-STAT3 and
anti–phospho-STAT3 antibody. D, T47D-D1
cells were plated on a 24-well plate
(1.5  104 per well) and treated with or
without tamoxifen in the presence of 0
and 20 Amol/L AG490 for 5 d. At day 5,
the percentage of cellular survival was
determined by MTT assay. Results

lines, the elevation in ER level alone does not lead to an increase
in ER activity in cells that have low level of cyclin D1. In cyclin
D1–overexpressing cells, however, tamoxifen stimulates the binding of cyclin D1 to the ER and this results in an increase in the ER
activity.
To further test our hypothesis, the association between cyclin D1
and STAT3 was also tested by immunoprecipitation. We found that
using the same extract as in Fig. 5A, tamoxifen reduced the
interaction between cyclin D1 and STAT3 (Fig. 5C, top). We next
tested more directly the effect of tamoxifen on STAT3 transcriptional activity using a STAT3 luciferase reporter. T47D and T47DD1 cells were transfected with a plasmid where the luciferase
reporter is under the control of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter containing two STAT3 consensus binding sites (26). After
24 h, cells were treated with or without tamoxifen for an additional
24 h and STAT3 activity was measured. We found that at a dose of
3 Amol/L, tamoxifen increased STAT3 activity in T47D-D1 cells by
2-fold, whereas no effect was observed in T47D cells (Fig. 5D). This
higher dose was used because unlike other experiments measuring
effect on growth rate over several days, the luciferase assay is
performed only 24 h following transfection. This result therefore
indicates that in the context of cyclin D1 overexpression, STAT3
transcriptional activity is activated following tamoxifen treatment.
The activation of STAT3 transcriptional activity following tamoxifen treatment was further tested in two additional ER-positive
cell lines that have elevated levels of cyclin D1, namely MCF-7 and
ZR-75.1 cells. We found that in both cell lines, STAT3 transcriptional activity was also stimulated by tamoxifen (data not shown);
further, this increase in activity correlated with an increase in
STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 in these cells lines (data not shown).
These results therefore support the hypothesis that following
tamoxifen treatment, cyclin D1 is sequestered from STAT3 and
redistributed to the ER.

Cyclin D1 is elevated in tamoxifen-resistant T47D clones.
To further test the role of cyclin D1 in tamoxifen resistance, we
isolated tamoxifen-resistant clones by long-term incubation of
T47D cells in the presence of tamoxifen. Although T47D cells
rapidly lost their ability to grow upon depletion of estrogen and
addition of tamoxifen, after a period of 1 year, resistant colonies
(Tam-R-T47D cells) were identified, suggesting that some isolated
cells had gained the ability to grow under these conditions
although their growth rate is slow. Upon expansion of individual
clones in estrogen-depleted/tamoxifen-containing medium, the
level of cyclin D1 in each clone was compared with that in T47D
cells grown under the same condition for 9 days. We found that in
all resistant clones, cyclin D1 levels were elevated compared with
the parental T47D cells (Fig. 6A). Quantification of cyclin D1 levels
revealed that in average, cyclin D1 was increased by 3.6-fold in
tamoxifen-resistant clones compared with T47D cells. One possible
explanation for this observation is that the difference in cyclin D1
levels may simply reflect differential growth rates between the two
cell types because T47D cannot grow in the absence of estrogen,
whereas resistant clones do grow. Conversely, in complete medium,
T47D cells grow at a much higher rate than the resistant clones
(data not shown); therefore, to circumvent this difficulty, we
compared the growth of resistant clones, which were incubated
either in estrogen-depleted/tamoxifen-containing medium or
complete medium over a period of 5 days. As expected, we found
that Tam-R-T47D clones grew although slowly in estrogendepleted/tamoxifen-containing medium, whereas their growth
was accelerated in complete medium (Fig. 6B). Despite the slower
growth of Tam-R-T47D clones in estrogen-depleted/tamoxifencontaining medium, the levels of cyclin D1 were much higher
compared with the levels of cyclin D1 in the more rapid growth in
complete medium (Fig. 6C). This result indicates that the levels of
cyclin D1 did not simply reflect the growth rate but rather that

the value of cyclin D1 as a prognostic factor is highly dependent on
the type of treatment.
The results presented here offer a potential explanation for the
apparent beneficial effect of cyclin D1 overexpression in patients
that do not receive tamoxifen as well as an explanation for the
adverse effect of tamoxifen on cyclin D1–overexpressing breast
cancer in premenopausal women. Figure 6D summarizes a model
to explain the dual effect of cyclin D1 overexpression in breast
cancer. In the absence of tamoxifen, cyclin D1 preferentially binds
to STAT3 and only weakly to the ER. This interaction with STAT3
leads to the repression of STAT3 activity and therefore of STAT3
own transcription. Whereas cyclin D1 can activate the ER and
therefore cellular proliferation, in the absence of tamoxifen the
proapoptotic activity that results from the repression of STAT3 is
able to counteract the proliferation and contribute to the slower
tumor growth rate observed in cyclin D1–overexpressing cancers.
The growth-inhibitory effect of cyclin D1 was, however, only
observed in vivo and not in vitro (Fig. 2B and C). This finding
may be explained by the fact that several transcriptional targets
of STAT3 are genes involved in angiogenesis and extracellular
matrix degradation. Therefore, because the growth in vitro does
not require such events, the lack of growth inhibition despite a
reduction in STAT3 levels is not surprising.

growth in estrogen-depleted/tamoxifen-containing medium
requires elevated levels of cyclin D1. This result further supports
the observation reported by others that inhibition of cyclin D1 by
siRNA abolishes the ability of tamoxifen-resistant clones to grow
in the presence of tamoxifen (27). In agreement with our finding
that STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 levels were elevated in cyclin
D1–overexpressing cells in the presence of tamoxifen, this was also
observed in tamoxifen-resistant clones (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The best known function of cyclin D1 is in the regulation of the
cell cycle and therefore the general expectation was that cyclin D1
overexpression would lead to increased proliferation and therefore
bad prognosis. However, several studies have reported a beneficial
effect of cyclin D1 overexpression in breast cancer. This unexpected
observation may relate to the fact that under the abnormal situation where cyclin D1 is overexpressed, excess cyclin D1 becomes
available for binding to other partners and therefore the cdkindependent functions of cyclin D1 need to be also considered in
its overall effect in breast cancer. An additional complicating factor
in defining the role of cyclin D1 in breast cancer is that its
overexpression is linked to tamoxifen resistance (28–33). Therefore,

Figure 5. Tamoxifen stimulates the sequestration of cyclin D1 by the ER. A, T47D-D1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged cyclin D1 plasmid and treated with
increasing concentrations of tamoxifen for 4 d. To determine the interaction between cyclin D1 and ER, protein extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP ) using
anti-HA antibody, and the levels of ER bound to cyclin D1 were detected using anti-ER antibody (top ). The levels of cyclin D1 on the immunoprecipitate are shown
as a control (middle). Crude protein extracts were analyzed to determine ER expression by Western blot (WB ) using anti-cyclin ER antibody (bottom ). B, T47D
and T47D-D1 cells were transfected with a vector expressing ERE-luciferase reporter plasmid. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without tamoxifen and luciferase
activity was measured after an additional 24 h. Relative activities of untreated controls in T47D and T47D-D1 cells were set at 1. C, the same protein precipitates
as in A were used to detect the levels of STAT3 bound to cyclin D1 using anti-STAT3 antibody (top ). Crude protein extracts were analyzed to determine the
levels of STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 by Western blot using anti-STAT3 and anti–phospho-STAT3 antibody (middle and bottom ). D, T47D and T47D-D1 cells were
transfected with a vector expressing a luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of STAT3 consensus binding sites linked to a thymidine kinase minimal
promoter. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without tamoxifen and luciferase activity was measured after an additional 24 h. Relative activities of untreated controls
in T47D and T47D-D1 cells were set at 1.

Tamoxifen Inhibits Cyclin D1–Mediated STAT3 Repression

Figure 6. Tamoxifen-resistant clones display elevated
cyclin D1 expression and activated STAT3. A, T47D cells
were incubated in the presence of tamoxifen (Tam) over a
period of 1 y. Colonies of tamoxifen-resistant cells
(Tam-R-T47D cells) were identified and transferred to a
12-well plate for their expansion. Following their expansion,
cells from five individual clones were used for Western
analysis of cyclin D1 using anti-cyclin D1 antibody. As a
control, T47D cells were incubated in absence of estrogen
for 9 d. B, Tam-R-T47D cells were either grown in
estrogen-depleted/tamoxifen-containing medium or in
complete (10% FBS) medium for 10 d and the medium
changed at day 5. After 10 d in culture, 1  105
Tam-R-T47D cells were plated in estrogen-depleted/
tamoxifen-containing medium or in complete (10% FBS)
medium and allowed to grow for 5 d. At day 5, the cells
were counted. C, cells obtained from growth conditions
described in B were harvested after 5 d in culture and
used for Western analysis using anti-cyclin D1,
anti-STAT3, and anti–phospho-STAT3 antibodies.

proliferation of cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors following tamoxifen treatment. Therefore, our data fully support the clinical
observation of an adverse effect of cyclin D1 gene amplification in
premenopausal women treated with tamoxifen (14). Further, our
data support the use of STAT3 inhibitors to overcome acquired
tamoxifen resistance.
The difference between the observed resistance associated with
elevated cyclin D1 protein versus the adverse effect associated with
elevated cyclin D1 gene raises the possibility that some other genes
in the cyclin D1 locus may affect the response. However, because
the growth-stimulatory effect of tamoxifen is observed in our cell
lines where only the cyclin D1 gene is overexpressed, our data
indicate that the effect is due to cyclin D1. Therefore, the difference
between the predictive value of cyclin D1 protein and cyclin D1

In the presence of tamoxifen, our data suggest that the conformational changes of the ER promote a stronger interaction of
cyclin D1 with the ER. Alternatively, the transcription of genes
specifically in response to tamoxifen may encode proteins that
facilitate the binding of cyclin D1 to the ER or prevent its binding
to STAT3. Our data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities, which will need to be addressed in the future. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism, the end result of tamoxifen
treatment, is the preferential binding of cyclin D1 to the ER rather
than to STAT3. The release of the repression of STAT3 that results
from this sequestration of cyclin D1 to the ER would allow the
transcription of STAT3 and its antiapoptotic effect. In this situation, both the activation of the ER by cyclin D1 and the antiapoptotic activity of STAT3 would contribute to the increased

premenopausal women with cyclin D1–positive tumors would
receive tamoxifen therapy. Strong clinical data has indicated the
adverse effect of tamoxifen in this group of patients (14). Our data
now offer a mechanistic rationale to explain these clinical observations and further support the idea that determining cyclin D1
levels in addition to ER may be critical in the better clinical
management of breast cancer using tamoxifen.

gene suggests that the method of scoring cyclin D1 intensity by
immunohistochemistry need to be refined or combined with
fluorescence in situ hybridization to identified the patients at
most risk of an adverse response.
In postmenopausal women, cyclin D1 overexpression led to
resistance to tamoxifen (13). Our data further support the use of
aromatase inhibitors as the preferred antihormonal treatment for
postmenopausal women.
Although our results support the adverse effect of tamoxifen on
cyclin D1–overexpressing tumors (17, 29–33), we also reported
previously that cyclin D1–overexpressing cells show an increased
sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (21). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the clinical use of bortezomib may
also be useful for the treatment of breast cancers resistant to
tamoxifen. This possibility will be addressed in the future.
In conclusion, because cyclin D1 overexpression is closely linked
to ER positivity in breast cancer (34, 35), it is highly likely that
