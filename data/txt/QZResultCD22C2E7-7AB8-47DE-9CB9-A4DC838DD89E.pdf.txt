ABSTRACT
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia
in Western countries. Loss of p53 function in CLL cells due to chromosome 17p
deletion or p53 mutations often leads to a more malignant disease phenotype and
is associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. Thus, development
of novel therapeutic strategies to effectively target CLL cells with p53 deficiency is
clinically important. Here we showed that p53-null CLL cells were highly sensitive to
ROS-mediated cell killing due to their intrinsic ROS stress. We further demonstrated
that a natural compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) was able to effectively kill
CLL cells with loss of p53, even under the protection of stromal cells. In p53-defficient
CLL cells, PEITC induced a rapid depletion of glutathione and a severe accumulation
of ROS, leading to massive leukemia cell death in the stromal microenvironment. The
drug-induced cell death was associated with a significant decrease of in MCL-1 survival
molecule. We further showed that ROS-mediated cell death was the key mechanism
by which PEITC induced cytotoxicity, since such cell death could be prevented by
addition of antioxidant NAC. Importantly, in vivo study showed that PEITC was able
to induce substantial leukemia cell death in mice. Treatment of CLL mice harboring
TCL1-Tg:p53-/- genotype with PEITC significantly prolonged the median survival time
of the animals. Our study identifies a vulnerability of p53-null CLL cells with high
sensitivity to ROS-generating agents, and suggests that PEITC may potentially be
useful for clinical treatment of CLL with 17p deletion and p53 mutations.

INTRODUCTION

deletion of chromosome 17p renders the leukemia cells
more resistant to standard therapy, and is associated with
more aggressive disease progression and a significantly
shorter overall survival [4]. Chromosome 17p contains
the p53 gene that encodes the tumor suppressor p53
protein. It has been suggested that a loss of p53 function
in CLL cells with 17p-deletion maybe a major factor
contributing to the drug resistance and poor clinical
outcome of this subgroup of patients [5–6]. Loss of p53
function has been documented in many cancer types [7].
Although 17p-deletion is seen in approximately 5–10%
of CLL patients, mutations in p53 genes are observed in
approximately 30% of CLL patients [8, 9]. This suggests

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized
by the accumulation of dysfunctional B lymphocytes in
the blood, bone marrow, spleen and other organs [1]. In
the recent years, major progress has been made in our
understanding of CLL biology and in the development
of new therapeutic agents, which significantly improve
the clinical outcomes of CLL patients. However, CLL
still remains as an incurable disease [2]. Cytogenetic
alterations are commonly observed in CLL patients, and
certain cytogenetic changes are associated with aggressive
disease progression and poor prognosis [3]. Notably,

that a large proportion of CLL patients likely have a defect
in p53 function. As the guardian of genome, p53 plays a
pivotal role in regulating important cellular functions such
as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
and drug sensitivity. However, the exact mechanisms by
which a loss of p53 contributes to drug resistance and
disease progression in CLL remains to be elucidated.
Recent study suggested that one of the mechanisms
was through up-regulation of MCL-1 expression via
suppression of microRNA-15a/miR-16-1 [10].
Considering the important role of loss of p53 in
cancer development and drug resistance in CLL cells, it
is important to develop new therapeutic strategies that
are effective in eliminating p53-null CLL cells based on
their biological properties. One noticeable biochemical
feature of CLL cells is their intrinsic high ROS stress
[11–13], which renders them more dependent on cellular
antioxidants such as GSH to maintain the redox balance.
As such, the high oxidative stress could serve as a
biochemical basis to preferentially target CLL cells, using
proper redox-modulating strategies [14]. For instance,
recent studies showed that phenethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC), a natural compound found in certain vegetables,
could induce depletion of glutathione (GSH) and cause
severe ROS accumulation leading to massive death of
CLL cells [13, 15]. PEITC seems able to effectively kill
fludarabine-resistant CLL cells [13]. Importantly, p53
plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial
integrity and metabolic functions [16, 17] and also
exhibits an antioxidant function [18]. Thus, a loss of p53
function due to mutations or 17p-deletion in CLL cells
would be expected to cause mitochondrial dysfunction
and subsequently disrupt redox homeostasis, leading to
increased ROS generation and oxidative stress.
Based on the above observations, we hypothesized
that CLL cells with loss of p53 function might be more
vulnerable to further oxidative stress, and targeting ROS
stress might be an attractive therapeutic strategy for
treatment of CLL with 17p-deletion and/or p53 mutations.
The main goal of this study was to test the possibility to
use PEITC as a potential agent to effectively eliminate
CLL cells with loss of p53, using both in vitro assay with
primary leukemia cells isolated from CLL patients with
17p-deletion and in vivo test in a CLL mouse model with
TCL1-Tg:p53-/- genotype [10]. We demonstrated that
PEITC was highly effective in eliminating p53-defective
CLL cells, even in the presence of bone marrow stromal
cells, which usually protect CLL cells from the cytotoxic
effect of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In vivo,
PEITC exhibited significant therapeutic effects and
significantly improved the overall survival of the p53-/CLL mice.

Effective killing of primary CLL cells with
17p-deletion by PEITC in the presence of bone
marrow stromal cells
We first tested the cytotoxic effect of PEITC against
primary CLL cells with 17p deletion isolated from the
peripheral blood samples of CLL patients. Two standard
anti-CLL drugs, Fludarabine (F-ara-A, the active chemical
form of Fludarabine for in vitro study) and Oxaliplatin,
were used for comparison with PEITC. As shown in
Figure 1A, primary CLL cells with 17p-deletion were
relatively resistant to F-ara-A and Oxaliplatin at a high
drug concentration (10 µM). There were 53% and 42%
survival cells at 48 h after treatment with F-ara-A and
Oxaliplatin, respectively. In contrast, PEITC at a relatively
low concentration (5 µM) effectively killed 17p- CLL
cells, with only 17% viable cells remained at 24 h after
drug incubation. The resistance of 17p- CLL cells to
standard anti-CLL agents and high sensitivity to PEITC
were consistently observed in separate experiments with
9 different CLL patient samples (Figure 1D).
Since stromal tissue microenvironment plays a
major role in protecting cancer cells, we then compared
the ability of the three compounds to kill 17p- CLL cells
in co-culture with human bone barrow stromal cells
(NKTert). As shown in Figure 1B, 17p- CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells exhibited better survival (97%
viable cells without drug treatment), and became more
resistant to F-ara-A (10 µM) and Oxaliplatin (10 µM) with
93% and 73% viable cells at 48 h, respectively. Similarly,
17p- CLL cells co-cultured with stromal cells were also
resistant to another chemotherapeutic agent Bendamustine
(Supplementary Figure S1). Under this stromal co-culture
condition, PEITC (5 µM) was still effective against 17pCLL cells, leading to a loss of 70% cell viability in 24 h.
Interestingly, PEITC showed similar efficacy against CLL
cell without 17p-deletion (Supplementary Figure S2),
suggesting that this compound is equally effective in CLL
cells regardless of the p53 status.
We also used purified CD19+ CLL cells form
patient samples to further confirm the above observations.
CD19+ B-cells were isolated from three 17p- CLL blood
samples, using CD19 antibody-coated microbeads. The
purified CLL cells were then incubated with F-ara-A,
Oxaliplatin, or PEITC in co-culture with stromal cells.
As shown in Figure 1C and 1E, the purified CD19+ CLL
cells with 17p deletion were relatively resistant to F-ara-A
and Oxaliplatin (60% and 55% survival, respectively), but
remained highly sensitive to PEITC (9% survival).
We also tested if PEITC could induce autophagy,
which could play a role protecting cells under certain
stress conditions. CLL cells isolated from four different
CLL patient samples were incubated with various
concentrations (1–20 µM) of PEITC for 24 h, and

Cytotoxic effect of PEITC against p53-/- leukemia
cells from mice in vitro and in vivo

Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression
of autophagy marker LC3. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S3, PEITC did not induced any significant changes
in LC3, suggesting that this compound did not induce
significant autophagy in CLL cells.

We next used a CLL mouse model with TCL1Tg:p53-/- genotype to further test the ability of PEITC

to kill leukemia cells with defined p53 deletion in vitro
and in vivo. We previously showed that this mouse
model resembles human CLL patients with 17p-deletion
with aggressive disease progression and drug-resistant
phenotype [10]. Leukemic lymphocytes were isolated
from the spleens of TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice (age 4-month)
and co-cultured with mouse stromal cells (Kusa-H1
cells). The cells were treated with 5 µM PEITC for
24 h, 10 µM of F-ara-A for 48 h, or 10 µM Oxaliplatin
for 48 h, and then analyzed by cell viability assay. We
found that these cells were resistant to F-ara-A treatment
(76% viable cells compared to 80% viable cells in the
untreated control sample) and partially resistant to
Oxaliplatin (42% viable cells). They were also resistant
to Bendamustine (Supplementary Figure S1). In contrast,
the mouse leukemia cells exhibited massive cell death
when incubated with a relatively low concentration
(5 µM) of PEITC, resulting in a loss of 87% cells in 24 h
(Figure 2A, 2B). Thus, consistent with the observations
in human CLL cells with 17p deletion, the leukemic
cells from the spleens of TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice were also
resistant to traditional chemotherapeutic agents but were
highly sensitive to PEITC in vitro.
To test the ability of PEITC to induce leukemia cell
death in vivo, we treated TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice with PEITC
by intravenous injection. After treatment for 2 weeks,
the mouse spleen tissue sections were processed for
analysis of cell death using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. As
shown in Figure 2C–2D, there was a significant increase in
TUNEL signal in the spleens of mice treated with PEITC,
indicating that PEITC was able to induce apoptotic cell
death in leukemic splenocytes in vivo.

prior to cell death. Thus, induction of GSH depletion and
severe ROS accumulation are upstream events that likely
result in severe oxidative damage leading to massive death
of the leukemia cells.
To further evaluate whether induction of GSH
depletion and severe ROS stress were primary events
that triggered cell death in CLL cells with loss of p53,
primary CLL cells with 17p- deletion were treated with an
antioxidant NAC (which promotes glutathione synthesis),
PEITC, or their combination. NAC consistently prevented
PEITC-induced ROS accumulation (Figure 4A–4B), GSH
depletion (Figure 4E) and cell death (Figure 4C–4D) in
different CLL patient samples with 17p-deletion. Similar
results were observed in mouse leukemic splenocytes
isolated from TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice (Figure 5). These data
together suggest that PEITC induced cell death in both
human and mouse CLL cells with loss of p53 through
depletion of GSH and induction of severe ROS stress.

Rapid degradation of MCL-1 protein induced by
PEITC in 17p- CLL cells
Because MCL-1 is a ROS-sensitive anti-apoptotic
protein that plays an important role in the survival of
CLL cells [13] and is up-regulated in primary 17p- CLL
cells and leukemic splenocytes from TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice
[10], we tested the possibility that PEITC might induce
degradation of MCL-1 in 17p- CLL cells owing to its
ability to induce severe ROS stress. As shown in Figure 6,
when CLL cells with 17p-deletion were treated with 5
µM PEITC, there was a significant decrease in MCL-1
protein within 2 h and further decrease was observed as
the incubation time prolonged. This is consistent with our
previous finding that PEITC induced degradation of MCl1 in part by causing deglutationylation of MCL-1 protein
[13]. In contrast, incubation of 17p- CLL cells with 10 µM
F-ara-A for 24–48 h did not cause any change in MCL-1
protein (Figure 6A).

Induction of severe ROS accumulation and
glutathione depletion by PEITC in p53-deficient
CLL cells
Based on the previous observations that PEITC
could induce ROS accumulation by causing GSH depletion
in cancer cells [13, 21], we tested if this mechanism might
be responsible for killing CLL cells with loss of p53.
We isolated primary leukemia cells from CLL patients
with 17p-deletion and leukemic splenocytes from TCL1Tg:p53-/- mice, and incubated them with PEITC. Shortly
after drug incubation, intracellular ROS was measured
by flow cytometry, which revealed a substantial increase
of cellular ROS in the PEITC-treated cells 90 minutes
after PEITC treatment. This was consistently observed in
both human primary CLL cells (Figure 3A) and in mouse
leukemic splenocytes (Figure 3B). Measurement of GSH
showed a severe GSH depletion 6 hours after PEITC
treatment in all five CLL patient samples with 17p-deletion
and seven CLL samples without 17p-deletion (Figure 3C).
It is important to note that these biochemical changes
occurred within several hours of drug incubation and were

In vivo therapeutic activity of PEITC in CLL
mice with p53 deletion
Based on the observations that PEITC was able to
induce significant CLL cell death in primary human CLL
cells in vitro and in leukemic splenocytes in CLL mice, we
further evaluated the in vivo therapeutic activity of PEITC
in CLL mice with TCL1-Tg:p53-/- genotype. PEITC was
first formulated in a stable nanoparticle formulation using
the pluronic F127 as the carrier as described in Methods.
To ensure that such formulation did not cause loss of
anticancer activity, we first compared the in vitro activity
of the original PEITC and the formulated PEITC for
their ability to kill both primary human CLL and mouse
leukemic cells. As shown in Figure 7A–7B, the formulated
PEITC and the original free PEITC exhibited comparable
cytotoxicity against CLL cells in vitro.

DISCUSSION

We then evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of
the formulated PEITC in CLL mice with TCL1-Tg:p53-/genotype. These mice developed leukemia with aggressive
disease progression, resembling human CLL disease with
17p deletion [10]. Without any drug treatment, over 50%
of mice died from CLL at 4-month of age, and most mice
died within 6 months (Figure 7C). Treatment with PEITC
significantly prolonged the survival of CLL mice, with
almost all mice survived over 6 months (Figure 7C). The
median survival time in the PEITC-treated group was
7.8 months, compared to 3.5 months in the control group.
In a separate study, we found that the traditional drug
fludarabine exhibited only moderate therapeutic activity
in the TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice with a median survival time
of 5.3 months (data not shown). These results together
strongly suggest that PEITC was highly effective in killing
p53-deficient CLL cells in vitro, and exhibited promising
therapeutic activity in vivo in the TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mouse
model.

Metabolic alterations including altered nutrient
metabolism and elevated ROS generation are among
the hallmarks of cancer [19]. Genetic and epigenetic
alterations of p53 gene have been frequently observed
in various types of cancer [20]. Such genetic alterations,
through their downstream signaling processes, often
induce metabolic changes in cancer cells. The tumor
suppressor molecule p53 plays an important role in
maintaining mitochondrial genetic integrity and normal
metabolic functions, and a loss of p53 function has
been linked to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations
and elevated ROS production in cancer cells [16–18].
Thus, a loss of normal p53 function in CLL cells due
to gene mutations or deletion (17p-deletion) would lead
to elevated oxidative stress, and render the leukemia
cells more vulnerable to further ROS stress induced by
pharmacological agents. This study was conducted to test

this research hypothesis, using primary CLL cells from
patients with 17p deletion and CLL mice with TCL1Tg:p53-/- genotype as experimental models. PEITC was
used to induce ROS stress through its ability to cause
rapid glutathione depletion, which is known to effectively
kill K-Ras transformed ovarian cancer cells and F-ara-Aresistant CLL cells through a ROS-mediated mechanism
[13, 15, 21]. The current study showed that PEITC is
indeed effective in killing p53-null CLL cells, which are
otherwise resistant to standard anti-CLL drugs such as
F-ara-A, Oxaliplatin and Bendamustine.
The promising therapeutic activity of PEITC was
observed both in vitro and in vivo. We further confirmed
that the key mechanism of PEITC action against p53-null
CLL cells was mediated by induction of a rapid depletion
of GSH and severe accumulation of ROS. This was
evidenced by direct measurement of GSH (Figure 3C)
and by the ability of NAC, a glutathione precursor and
antioxidant, to prevent PEITC-induced ROS accumulation
and suppress the drug-induced cell death both in primary
17p- leukemia cells from CLL patients (Figure 4) and in
mouse leukemic cells from TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice (Figure 5).
It is worth noting that PEITC is equally effective in killing
CLL cells without loss of p53 (Supplementary Figure
S2), since CLL cells are in general under high ROS stress

and highly dependent on GSH to maintain redox balance.
The ability of PEITC to effectively kill CLL cells with or
without 17p deletion would be advantageous as a drug for
clinical treatment of CLL patients with 17p deletion, since
these patients harbor both 17p-deleted and 17p-wild type
CLL cells.
In the tumor microenvironment, the interactions
between cancer cells and stromal cells are complex
biological processes that, through secretion of stromal
factors and metabolic communication, often promote
tumor cell survival, proliferation, and migration, leading to
drug resistance and metastasis [19]. For example, elevated
ROS levels in p53-deficient fibroblasts may induce
E-cadherin expression in tumor cells and thereby promote
cancer cell migration [22]. In case of CLL, the stromal
factors such as SDF-1 (CXCL-12), BAFF, and APRIL
play a major role in protection of the leukemia cells [23].
Furthermore, stromal cells can also provide certain critical
metabolites such as cysteine to CLL cells to enhance their
GSH synthesis and thus promote CLL survival and drug
resistance [24]. The stromal protection of leukemia cells
is considered as an important factor contributing to the
persistence of residual disease after chemotherapy, and
imposes a major challenge in clinical treatment of CLL.
Our study showed that PEITC was able to effectively kill

MCL-1 is an important anti-apoptotic molecule that
belongs to the Bcl-2 family. Our study showed that PEITC
was able to cause a rapid decrease in MCL-1 protein in
p53-null CLL cells within 2–5 hours after drug incubation,
whereas treatment with 10 µM F-ara-A for 48 h did not

cause any significant decrease in MCL-1 (Figure 6A). The
exact mechanisms by which PEITC causes a decrease of
MCL-1 remain unclear at the present time. One possible
mechanism is that PEITC might induce degradation of
MCL-1 protein due to a severe depletion of glutathione,

leading to lower glutathionylation of MCL-1 protein
and instability. Indeed, our previous study showed that
MCL-1 protein was glutathionylated in CLL cells and
such glutathionylation was reduced by PEITC treatment
[13]. The fact that addition of NAC to replenish GSH
could increase the stability of MCL-1 and prevent PEITCinduced loss of MCL-1 [13] further support the importance
of glutathionylation in the regulation of MCL-1 stability.
Interestingly, a recent study showed that inactivation
of MCL-1 by a NOXA-dependent pathway sensitized
renal cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents [25]. The
involvement of NOXA in affecting MCL-1 stability in
CLL cells and the underlying mechanisms remains to be
investigated.
In summary, our study showed that although CLL
cells with loss of p53 were resistant to conventional
anti-CLL drugs such as F-ara-A, Oxaliplatin and
Bendamustine, these leukemia cells remain sensitive to
PEITC, even when CLL cell was under the protection
of bone marrow stromal cells. This high sensitivity of
CLL cells to ROS-modulating agents is likely due to
the intrinsic oxidative stress when p53 function is lost
in CLL cells as a consequence of 17p-deletion. PEITC
induced massive cell death in primary 17p- CLL cells and
p53-/- mouse leukemia cells through induction of severe
GSH depletion and ROS accumulation, accompanied by
a decrease of MCL-1 protein. Most importantly, in vivo
treatment TCL1-Tg:p53-/- CLL with PEITC significantly
extended the survival time of the leukemic mice. It
should be noted that PEITC at the concentration of 5 µM
was highly effective against p53-/- CLL cells, and such
concentration range is likely achievable in vivo according
to pharmacokinetic study [26, 27]. The promising
therapeutic activity of PEITC against p53-defficient CLL
cells in vitro and in vivo suggests that this compound
has a potential for use in treatment of CLL patients with
17p-deletion, and warrants further evaluation in clinical
setting.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridinetriphosphatase nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining kit
was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis,
IN). A glutathione assay kit was purchased from Cayman
Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-MCL-1 was from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-LC3 was
purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation (Billerica,
MA). Anti-β-actin was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA).

Formulation of PEITC or in vivo administration
PEITC (20 mg) was dissolved in EtAc (1 ml) to
form PEITC solution, which was introduced into 2 mL of
pluronic F127 water solution at the concentration of 5%
(w/w) under stirring by T10 homogenizer (IKA, Germany)
in ice bath. About 30 min later, well-mixed oil in water
(O/W) emulsion was formed. Then, EtAc was evaporated
in rotator evaporator (BÜCHI, Switzerland) at 4oC for
4–6 hours and the PEITC nanoparticles were obtained.
The PEITC nanoparticles slurry was lyophilized and the
powder was stored at 4oC for future use. All the procedures
were performed in the environment direct light exposure.
TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice were treated with (100 mg/kg)
formulated PEITC twice a week through tail vein
injection (i.v.). Treatment began when the mice reached
the age of 8 weeks.

Isolation of CLL cells and cytotoxicity assays
Primary leukemia cells (white blood cells) were
isolated from the peripheral blood samples of CLL
patients diagnosed according to the NCI criteria [28].
Proper informed consents under a research protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD
Anderson Cancer Center were obtained from all patients
before the collection of blood samples. Primary CLL cells
were isolated from blood samples by density gradient
centrifugation as described previously [13], and incubated
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and Penicillin (100 U/ml) + Streptomycin (100 ug/ml)
overnight before testing drug sensitivity by incubation
with F-ara-A or Oxaliplatin for 48 h or PEITC for 24 h
in presence or absence of human stromal NKTert cells.
CD19+ B cells were purified from CLL blood samples
by using CD19 microbeads, and incubated in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and Penicillin
(100  U/ml) + Streptomycin (100 ug/ml). On the same
day, these B leukemic cells were co-cultured with stromal
NKTert cells and treated with F-ara-A or Oxaliplatin for
48 h or PEITC for 24 h. Mouse splenocytes were isolated
from TCL1-Tg:p53-/- mice, and red blood cells were
removed from the splenocytes by ACK lysis buffer. After
lysis of red blood cells, the splenocytes were washed with

CLL cells (5 × 105 cells) with 1 µM CM-H2DCF-DA for 60
minutes and analyzed by flow cytometry as described [21].

Analysis of cellular glutathione
A glutathione assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI) was used to measure cellular glutathione. After
preparing cell extracts by sonication and deproteination,
GSH was determined as described [21].

Statistical analysis
Studentʼs t test was used for testing the statistical
difference between two groups of samples. Mouse survival
curves (Kaplan-Meier plots) were generated by Graphpad
Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) as described
[10], and the statistical significance of the mouse survival
curves was analyzed by the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
