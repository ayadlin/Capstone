Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Preclinical data indicate EGFR signals through both kinasedependent and independent pathways and that combining a small-molecule EGFR
inhibitor, EGFR antibody, and/or anti-angiogenic agent is synergistic in animal models.
METHODS: We conducted a dose-escalation, phase I study combining erlotinib,
cetuximab, and bevacizumab. The subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) was analyzed for safety and response.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with NSCLC (median four prior therapies) received
treatment on a range of dose levels. The most common treatment-related grade ≥2
adverse events were rash (n=14, 41%), hypomagnesemia (n=9, 27%), and fatigue
(n=5, 15%). Seven patients (21%) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥6 months, two
achieved a partial response (PR) (6%), and two achieved an unconfirmed partial
response (uPR) (6%) (total=32%). We observed SD≥6 months/PR/uPR in patients
who had received prior erlotinib and/or bevacizumab, those with brain metastases,
smokers, and patients treated at lower dose levels. Five of 16 patients (31%) with
wild-type EGFR experienced SD≥6 months or uPR. Correlation between grade of rash
and rate of SD≥6 months/PR was observed (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: The combination of erlotinib, cetuximab, and bevacizumab was
well-tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients
with NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

mutations [3, 10-12], and both resistant (e.g., L861Q) and
sensitive (e.g., exon 18 G719S, exon 19 deletion or exon
21 L858R point mutation) mutations have been identified
[12-15]. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody to EGFR, has
demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC when combined with
chemotherapy [16], but is not currently FDA-approved
for NSCLC.
Recently, Weihua, et al. [17] discovered that EGFR
can maintain cancer cell survival independent of its
kinase activity. This kinase-independent pathway operates
via increased glucose uptake due to stabilization of the
SGLT1 glucose transporter, with a downstream effect of
reduced autophagy [17]. Therefore, targeting both kinasedependent and kinase-independent EGFR functions may
be a rational treatment strategy. Indeed, studies in animal

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in
tumorigenesis [1], and signals via downstream effectors
[2]. EGFR mutations are seen in ~13% of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United States
[3], with a higher incidence in Japanese patients [4], and
contribute to the pathogenesis of affected lung tumors.
Targeted therapies have shown promise in the treatment
of NSCLC, with studies selecting patients for molecular
targets faring better in general [5-8]. Erlotinib, an EGFR
inhibitor, is approved by the Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) to treat locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC [9].
Most responses to erlotinib occur in patients with EGFR

models revealed that combining antibodies and kinase
inhibitors was synergistic [18, 19]. Cetuximab blocks
receptor activation by interfering with ligand binding,
as well as down-regulating EGFR levels and inhibiting
cell growth in association with inhibition of ligandindependent EGFR signaling [20, 21]. Therefore, it is
plausible that treatment with cetuximab could suppress
kinase-independent cell signaling [21].
Angiogenesis also plays an important role in tumor
development and metastasis [22], mediated in large part
by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its
receptor VEGFR [23]. Bevacizumab is a recombinant antiVEGF monoclonal antibody FDA-approved for treatment
of unresectable, locally-advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
NSCLC in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin [9,
24].
Unfortunately, targeting angiogenesis or EGFR
alone does not provide adequate tumor control in many
patients [25-27]. Prior studies combining erlotinib and
cetuximab or gefitinib and cetuximab failed to demonstrate
tumor regressions in patients with lung adenocarcinomas
resistant to erlotinib [28] or patients with NSCLC
previously treated with platinum-based therapy [29],
respectively. In contrast, targeting both VEGF and EGFR
pathways demonstrated synergy in vivo [30, 31], possibly
because resistance to EGFR inhibitors may be mediated
at least partly by activating VEGF-dependent signaling
as an alternative survival pathway [30, 31]. Furthermore,
combining erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with
NSCLC who had not received prior anti-VEGF or antiEGFR treatment, showed response rates (CR/PR) of 1820% [31, 32] and improved progression-free survival
(PFS), but not overall survival (OS) [33].
Here, we report, for the first time, the results of
administering dual EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib plus
cetuximab) together with an anti-angiogenic agent
(bevacizumab) in 34 patients with heavily-pretreated
NSCLC.

(E542K and E545K). PTEN expression was tested by
immunohistochemistry (n=3) or mutation analysis (n=2),
and no aberrations were found.

Adverse Events
The most common treatment-related grade
2 or higher adverse events were rash (n=14, 41%),
hypomagnesemia (n=9, 26%), and fatigue (n=5, 15%)
(Table 1). Treatment-related grade 2 hypotension,
hemoptysis, neuropathy, vomiting, anorexia, infusion
reaction, proteinuria, and grade 3 diarrhea were each
observed in only one patient. Two patients experienced
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), including grade 3 rash (n=1,
dose level 8) and grade 3 bronchospasm (n=1, dose level
6). Twenty-four patients (71%) experienced no drugrelated toxicity higher than grade 1. Three patients (9%)
withdrew due to toxicity, including grade 3 bronchospasm
in cycle 1 (n=1), grade 1 diarrhea in cycle 1 (n=1), and
grade 3 fatigue in cycle 4 (n=1). No deaths resulted from
adverse events. The RP2D was level 8, which includes the
recommended FDA-approved full dose of each medication
[34].

Responses

RESULTS

All 34 patients are included in the response data
(Figure 1). Three patients withdrew before the first
restaging assessment due to toxicity, and one patient
withdrew early because of financial considerations. These
four patients and any patients with clinical progression
or new lesions are arbitrarily depicted as 21% increase
(Figure 1) and are considered treatment failures. Four
patients (12%) achieved a PR (two were unconfirmed PR
(uPR)) and received treatment for 4, 6, 10, and 14 months
(Table 3, Figure 2). Seven patients (21%) achieved stable
disease (SD) lasting at least 6 months (duration was 6,
6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 25 months) (total SD≥6 months/PR/
uPR=11, (32%)).

Demographics

Prior EGFR inhibitor or VEGF Inhibitor Therapy
and Response

Thirty-four patients with NSCLC were enrolled
(Table 2). All patients had progressive disease at the time
of enrollment. Most patients were heavily pretreated,
with a median of four prior therapies (range 1-8). Most
patients (76%) had adenocarcinoma histology. Thirteen
patients (38%) were previously treated with erlotinib, and
11 patients (32%) had previously received bevacizumab.
Three of 19 patients tested (16%) had EGFR mutations;
19 patients tested for KRAS mutations were all wild-type.
The only patient tested for p53 had a mutation (R196*),
and two patients out of nine tested had PIK3CA mutations

Of all 34 patients on study, seven patients (21%)
had received prior erlotinib but no prior bevacizumab,
five patients (15%) had received prior bevacizumab but
no prior erlotinib, and six additional patients (18%) had
received prior erlotinib and bevacizumab (five patients
received prior sequential erlotinib and bevacizumab;
one patient received prior concurrent erlotinib and
bevacizumab). No patients had previously received
cetuximab. Of seven patients who received prior erlotinib
but no prior bevacizumab, two (29%) had SD≥6 months/
uPR. Of the five patients who received prior bevacizumab

but no prior erlotinib, three (60%) had SD≥6 months/uPR.
Of the six patients who had received both prior erlotinib
and bevacizumab, two (33%) achieved SD≥6 months/PR.
The patient who received prior concurrent erlotinib and
bevacizumab did not achieve SD≥6 months/PR.
Of the 11 patients with SD≥6 months/PR/uPR,
four (36%) had prior EGFR inhibitor treatment (two with
erlotinib alone and two with prior sequential erlotinib and
bevacizumab), five (45%) had prior bevacizumab (three
with bevacizumab alone and two with prior sequential
erlotinib and bevacizumab), and four (36%) had neither
prior erlotinib or bevacizumab (Table 3). Prior EGFR
and/or antiangiogenic treatment did not preclude SD≥6
months/PR/uPR.
Among the four patients with SD≥6 months/PR/uPR
who had received prior erlotinib, one patient had primary
resistance to erlotinib alone, having developed progression
after two months of erlotinib (Table 3, patient #146).
Three patients (75%) received the combination treatment
for as long or longer than the duration of the prior erlotinib
(Table 3, patients #197, 90, and 146) (2, 5, and 13 months,
respectively, with initial erlotinib treatment, and 6, 9, and
14 months, respectively, with the combination treatment).
Overcoming primary resistance to erlotinib and achieving
a longer duration of treatment with this combination was
demonstrated.

Of 11 patients with brain metastases, three achieved
a PR/uPR, and three had SD≥6 months (total six of 11,
54%) (Table 3). One of these patients had five small,
untreated brain metastases and achieved complete
resolution of the brain tumors. The presence of brain
metastases did not preclude SD≥6 months/PR/uPR.

Smoking History and Response
Twenty-three (68%) of the patients had a history
of smoking. Of these 23 patients, two (9%) achieved a
PR/uPR, and five (22%) had stable disease SD≥6 months
(total=31%), including one patient who was treated for 25
months (Table 3). Of the 11 patients (32%) that did not
have a history of smoking, two achieved a PR/uPR, and
two had SD≥6 months (total=36%) (Table 3). Smoking
history did not preclude SD≥6 months/PR/uPR.

Dosing and Response
Of 17 patients on dose levels 7 or 8, six (35%)
achieved SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. For patients treated at
dose levels 1-6, five of 17 (29%) achieved SD≥6 months/
PR (Table 1 and Figure 1). The only patient treated on

(exon 20 insertion and exon 19 deletion) demonstrated
20% and 11% regression, respectively, as best response,
but the regressions were short—2 and 4 months on
treatment, respectively. The presence of wild-type EGFR
did not preclude achieving SD≥6 months/uPR.
The only patient tested for p53 mutations had an
R196* nonsense mutation. This patient achieved a 22%
regression lasting 25 months.
Two of the nine total patients tested demonstrated
PIK3CA mutations. One had an E542K mutation (with
concomitant EGFR mutation) and had a 55% regression,
as mentioned above. The other patient, with an E545K
mutation, had a 28% decrease (treatment duration=4
months). The presence of PIK3CA mutations did not
preclude response.
Three patients were tested for PTEN loss, and in all
patients, PTEN expression was normal. While PTEN loss
can reflect a genetic aberration in NSCLC [36], the two
patients tested for PTEN mutation were wild-type.

Toxicity and Response
Rash was the most frequently observed toxicity in
patients (Table 1); 11 patients experienced grade 2 rash, of
whom five (45%) achieved SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. Two of
three patients with grade 3 rash or higher achieved SD≥6
months/uPR (Table 3). Of 20 patients with grade 1 or no
rash, four (20%) achieved SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. Patients
with higher grade rash were significantly more likely to
have SD≥6 months/PR/uPR (Spearman’s correlation
coefficient, p<0.01).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report the results of the cohort
of patients with NSCLC treated on a phase I doseescalation trial of combination bevacizumab, cetuximab,
and erlotinib. The rationale for this combination was:
(1) preclinical and clinical studies that suggested
increased activity when erlotinib was combined with
bevacizumab [30, 31]; (2) preclinical studies indicating
that EGFR signals through both kinase-dependent and
-independent pathways [17]; and (3) studies demonstrating
that combining an EGFR kinase inhibitor with EGFR
antibodies was synergistic in animal models [18, 19].
This combination of drugs was well-tolerated. The
RP2D was determined to be the full FDA-approved doses
for all three drugs [34], and 13 of the 14 patients (93%)
treated at the RP2D tolerated treatment without drugrelated dose-limiting effects.
This regimen demonstrated antitumor activity in
patients with NSCLC, including 11 patients (32%) who
had a best overall response of SD≥6 months (n=7) or PR
(n=4) (two PRs were unconfirmed). SD≥6 months/PR/uPR
were observed even in patients who had received prior

dose level 2 was stable for 6 months; two of the five
patients treated on dose level 3 achieved SD≥6 months/
PR. There was no obvious dose-response correlation,
although the number of patients was small.

Molecular Aberrations and Responses
Of 16 patients with documented wild-type EGFR,
five (31%) had SD≥6 months or uPR. Three of 19 patients
tested for EGFR aberrations showed an abnormality,
and one of the three patients, with an activating L858R
mutation [35] and a G873E mutation, had a PR. This
patient also demonstrated a co-existing PIK3CA
mutation and had received prior sequential erlotinib
and bevacizumab; on the current study, the patient has
achieved a 55% regression and received treatment for 14
months. The other two patients with EGFR aberrations

bevacizumab and/or erlotinib, those with brain metastases,
smokers, and patients treated at lower dose levels, so these
characteristics do not preclude antitumor activity.
Remarkably, patients who previously had failed
erlotinib also achieved SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. In fact,
overcoming primary resistance to erlotinib and achieving
a longer duration of treatment with this combination
than with prior erlotinib alone was demonstrated. Recent
preclinical studies suggest that combining EGFR kinase
inhibitors and anti-EGFR antibodies may be more
effective than either alone, perhaps because EGFR is able
to maintain cancer cell survival independent of its kinase
activity [17-19]. The clinical data presented here also
support combining kinase inhibitors and antibodies.
Previous phase I/II clinical studies combining
cetuximab and erlotinib in patients with NSCLC failed
to show significant tumor regression [28]. In contrast,
as mentioned above, four patients on our study achieved
a PR/uPR. The reason for this difference is unclear but
could be due to the addition of bevacizumab in our
regimen or because almost half of the patients treated on
the prior study (but none in our study) had a known EGFR
resistance mutation [37, 38]. It is important to use caution

comparing the previous study to the results presented
here because the previous study was conducted in a
select group of patients, i.e., only patients with NSCLC
who had received erlotinib throughout one month prior
to enrollment and who had clinically-defined erlotinib
resistance.
Prior studies combining erlotinib and bevacizumab
showed PR/CR rates of 18-20% and improved PFS, but
no improvement in OS, supporting a potential role for
bevacizumab [32, 33]. However, these results cannot be
compared directly with those in our study because patients
in the prior studies were less heavily pretreated (median
1-2 prior systemic regimens versus four in our study) and
both prior studies excluded patients who had received
previous EGFR or VEGF inhibitors.
The presence of brain metastases did not
compromise the rate of SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. Five of 11
patients with brain metastases achieved SD≥6 months/PR/
uPR, and one individual showed complete resolution of her
brain metastases. No patient had intracranial hemorrhage.
These results suggest that patients with NSCLC and brain
metastases can safely receive this regimen and that it has
activity, which is consistent with a previous studies on the

efficacy of TKIs against brain metastases in NSCLC [39].
SD≥6 months/PR/uPR were observed even at low
dose levels. No dose-related difference was observed in
the number of patients who achieved SD≥6 months/PR/
uPR (six of 17 patients at dose levels 7-8 versus five of 17
patients at dose levels 1-6). These data are consistent with
a previous study of 683 patients receiving treatment on
phase I trials in our department which found that patients
who received lower doses of predominantly targeted
agents fared as well as those receiving higher doses [40].
Exploratory analysis of molecular aberrations
was performed to identify potential subsets of patients
with SD≥6 months/PR/uPR. EGFR, PIK3CA, PTEN,
and p53 mutation data were available for 20 patients,
including patients who had PTEN assessed by
immunohistochemistry. Although the limited number
of patients prevents definitive conclusions, it was noted
that all five patients with molecular aberrations (EGFR
mutations L848R and G873E and PIK3CA mutation
E542K (n=1), EGFR exon 20 insertion (n=1), EGFR exon
19 deletion (n=1), p53 mutation (n=1), PIK3CA mutation
(n=1)) experienced tumor regression, which in some cases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was prolonged.
Of special interest, out of 16 patients with
documented wild-type EGFR, five (31%) achieved SD≥6
months/uPR. Although EGFR mutations are generally
found in lung cancer patients who are non-smokers [41],
seven of 23 smokers (30%) achieved SD≥6 months/PR/
uPR. These data suggest that wild-type EGFR and/or a
history of smoking did not preclude salutary effects with
this regimen.
In regard to toxicity, previous studies have shown a
correlation between rash and response to EGFR inhibitors
[42]. In our study, patients who had higher grade rash were
more likely to have SD≥6 months/PR/uPR (p<0.01). In
previous studies of metastatic colorectal cancer combining
bevacizumab, cetuximab, and cytotoxic chemotherapy, the
addition of cetuximab shortened progression-free survival
[43, 44]. In contrast, our trial combined bevacizumab and
cetuximab without chemotherapy. Future studies should
be pursued to further investigate this combination without
chemotherapy.
Despite the promising responses observed in our
study, most patients developed progressive disease, which

may be explained by multiple potential mechanisms of
resistance [45-47]. Future studies should be considered
to further investigate causes of resistance in the clinical
setting.
In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate
that dual inhibition of EGFR with erlotinib and cetuximab,
combined with the VEGF antibody bevacizumab, is welltolerated, allowing full doses of all three drugs in patients
with NSCLC. SD≥6 months/PR/uPR was achieved
in 32% of this heavily pretreated patient population,
including patients with brain metastases, smokers,
those treated at lower doses, those with prior erlotinib
and/or bevacizumab, and those with wild-type EGFR.
These results suggest that this regimen merits further
investigation.

Study Design
The study was conducted at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) per
Institutional Review Board guidelines. The lung cancer
cohort reported herein included all patients with NSCLC
who started therapy between 4/7/2008 and 12/27/2010 as
part of a dose-escalation study conducted in patients with
advanced cancer. The dose escalation portion of the study
determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be
bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every two weeks; cetuximab
loading 400 mg/m2, maintenance 250 mg/m2 IV weekly;
and erlotinib 150 mg PO daily [34]. A cycle was 28 days.
Patients were treated at variable dose levels, depending on
the time of study entry (Table 1).

(EGFR mutation not done, smoker), who achieved a PR (59% decrease), at baseline (i) and 32 weeks (ii), (B) patient #197 (EGFR L858R,
G873E and PIK3CA E542K mutations, nonsmoker) who achieved a PR (55% decrease), at baseline (i) and 20 weeks (ii), and (C) patient
#200 (EGFR wild-type, smoker), who achieved an unconfirmed PR (48% decrease), at baseline (i) and 8 weeks (ii).

Statistical Analysis

Patients had metastatic or advanced NSCLC not
amendable to standard therapy, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 [48],
and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
Exclusion criteria included hemoptysis, unexplained
bleeding, significant cardiovascular disease, intercurrent
uncontrolled illness, significant gastrointestinal bleeding
within 28 days, hemorrhagic brain metastases, prior
abdominal surgery within 30 days, pregnancy, and a
history of hypersensitivity to bevacizumab, cetuximab,
and/or erlotinib. Treatment with prior cytotoxic therapies
must have ended at least three weeks prior to enrollment,
and biologic therapy must have ended at least two weeks
or five drug half-lives prior to enrollment (whichever is
shorter).

No formal hypotheses were tested, and analyses
were descriptive and exploratory.
Non-parametric
correlations were determined with Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient.

Molecular Testing
EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, p53, and PTEN
mutation analysis, as well as PTEN expression by
immunohistochemistry, were performed in the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center laboratory for patients with
available archived tissue. For EGFR (exons 18-21 of the
kinase domain), KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61), PIK3CA
(codons 532-554 in exon 9 and codons 1011-1062 in exon
20), p53 (exons 4-9), and PTEN mutation (exons 1-9
(entire coding sequence)) testing, PCR-based sequencing
analysis was performed on DNA extracted from paraffinembedded tumor tissue. The lower limit of detection was
approximately one cell bearing the mutation per five to
ten normal cells. PTEN expression was determined by
immunohistochemistry using anti-PTEN monoclonal
mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
