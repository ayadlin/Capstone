BACKGROUND: This study sought to compare the effectiveness of aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment in reducing cancerspecific mortality for older men with early-stage prostate cancer across differing comorbid disease burdens at diagnosis. METHODS:
In total, the authors sampled 140,553 men aged 66 years with early-stage prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 1991 and
2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Propensity-adjusted competing-risks regression analysis was used to compare the risk of cancer-specific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment
among comorbidity subgroups. RESULTS: In propensity-adjusted competing-risks regression analysis, aggressive treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of cancer-specific mortality among men who had Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2 but not among
men who had Charlson scores 3 (subhazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.18). The absolute reduction in 15-year cancerspecific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment was 6.1%, 4.3%, 3.9%, and 0.9% for men
with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Among men who had well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumors,
aggressive treatment again was associated with a lower risk of cancer-specific mortality for those who had Charlson scores of 0, 1,
and 2 but not for those who had Charlson scores 3 (subhazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.89). The absolute reduction
in 15-year cancer-specific mortality between men who received aggressive versus nonaggressive treatment was 3.8%, 3%, 1.9%, and
20.5% for men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cancer-specific survival benefit from aggressive treatment for early-stage prostate cancer diminishes with increasing comorbidity at diagnosis. Men with Charlson scores 3 garC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Men with multiple comorbidities are at high risk for overtreatment of early-stage prostate cancer. Because the survival
advantage associated with surgery and radiation therapy is realized only after many years,1 men with multiple comorbidities who have a low likelihood of long-term survival2-6 are unlikely to benefit from these aggressive treatments. Although
the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines recommend against aggressive treatment for such men,7-9 comorbidity is poorly integrated into treatment
decision making due to a lack of data linking comorbidity status and treatment outcomes.10 In fact, no robust studies have
directly compared aggressive and nonaggressive treatment across groups of men with differing levels of comorbidity to
determine who does and does not reap a survival benefit from aggressive treatment. Therefore, it is difficult for clinicians
to confidently counsel these men for or against aggressive treatment based on comorbidity. In practice, men with Charlson
scores 3 receive aggressive treatment with surgery or radiation therapy more than half of the time, despite a 70% probability of other-cause mortality at 8 years after diagnosis.10
Aggressive treatment of men with multiple major comorbidities poses both an unnecessary health hazard to these
men and an undue burden on our overtaxed health care system. Because all aggressive local treatments for prostate cancer
may confer side effects that can substantially affect quality of life,11-13 aggressive treatment of men who are unlikely to benefit often creates new health problems—impotence, urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction—while not achieving the

primary objective of increasing cancer-specific survival. In
addition, because early-stage prostate cancer comprises
28% of new U.S. cancer diagnoses annually (approximately 238,000 men)14 and the medical expenditures for
treatment of prostate cancer in the U.S. totaled $2.1 billion in 2007,15 the cost of overtreating even a small fraction of these men has the potential to divert significant
financial resources from other needs in our strained
healthcare system.
We conducted a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative cohort of men with early-stage prostate
cancer to compare the effectiveness of aggressive versus
nonaggressive treatment in improving cancer-specific survival among men with different comorbidity burdens at
diagnosis. We investigated this issue in men with all levels
of tumor risk and in the subset of men who had welldifferentiated or moderately-differentiated tumors (Gleason scores 7). We also wanted to define the absolute
risks of death from other causes according to comorbidity
burden at diagnosis. We hypothesized that older men
with substantial comorbid disease burdens would have
less cancer-specific survival benefit with aggressive treatment because the vast majority of them do not live long
enough to die of prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

We identified men aged 65 years with incident prostate cancer (International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision [ICD-9] code 185.0) who were diagnosed between January 1, 1992 and December 31,
2011 using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. This database
contains Medicare insurance program files linked to the
population-based SEER cancer registries. The Medicare
database covers approximately 97% of the US population aged 65 years, and SEER regions encompass
approximately 14% of the US population before 2000
and 25% thereafter. Linkage to the SEER database is
complete for approximately 93% of patients. Our
cohort included men with well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated, or poorly-differentiated T1 or T2
tumors. We repeated our analyses using a subgroup of
men with well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated T1 or T2 tumors. We excluded men who had T3,
T4, and metastatic tumors. The final analytic cohort
included only men aged 66 years, because we needed
to determine the comorbidity burden at diagnosis using
claims data from 12 months before diagnosis.

Predictor and Outcome Definitions
Sociodemographic data

We determined sociodemographic information including
age at diagnosis, race, marital status, year of diagnosis, and
zip code of residence using SEER data from the Patient
Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File of the Medicare
data set. Patients were categorized into groups according
to age at diagnosis (ages 66-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79
years, and 80 years). Race was grouped as black, white,
Hispanic, or other. Marital status was defined as married
or unmarried.
Comorbidity

Comorbidity burden at diagnosis was ascertained using
both inpatient claims (Medicare Provider Analysis and
Review [MEDPAR] Part A and Carrier Part B files) and
outpatient claims information for the 12-month period
preceding prostate cancer diagnosis. Comorbidity was
assessed using the Deyo-Klabunde modification of the
Charlson comorbidity index, a validated method of determining Charlson scores using inpatient and outpatient
claims data.16,17 We grouped men according to Charlson
scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Tumor data

Tumor data including tumor pathology, stage, and histologic grade, were obtained using SEER data. We limited our analysis to men with prostatic adenocarcinoma
(ICD-9 code 185.0). We used extent-of-disease (EOD)
codes corresponding to American Joint Committee on
Cancer Cancer Staging Manual, Sixth Edition definitions
to define clinical tumor (T) stage classifications as T1
(EOD codes 13-15), T2 (EOD codes 24-29), or T1/T2
(EOD codes 30-34, 40, 41, 48, and 49). Tumor grade
was defined using World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Revision (ICD-O-3) codes as well-differentiated (Gleason
score 2-4; ICD-O-3 code 81403/1), moderately-differentiated (Gleason score 5-7; ICD-O-3 code 81403/2),
and poorly-differentiated (Gleason score 8-10; ICD-O3 code 81403/3). It is noteworthy that after 2003,
SEER coded men with Gleason scores of 7 using the
poorly differentiated code 81403/3; therefore, men with
Gleason scores of 7 are included in both of these
groups.
Type of Treatment

Type of treatment was identified by using International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) version 4 (CPT-4)
codes within the MEDPAR, National Claims History,
2433

and Outpatient files of the Medicare data set. Treatment
was categorized as aggressive or nonaggressive. Aggressive
treatment was defined as radical prostatectomy (CPT-4
codes 55801, 55810, 55812, 55821, 55831, 55840,
55842, and 55845; ICD-9 codes 60.3-60.66 and 60.62),
radiation therapy (CPT-4 codes 77305, 77310, 77315,
77321, 77332-77334, 77336, 77370, 77261-77263,
77280, 77285, 77290, 77295, 77299, 77300, 7740177431, and 77520-77525; ICD-9 codes 92.21-92.24,
V58.0, V66.1, and V67), or brachytherapy (CPT-4 codes
55859, 55860, 55862, 55865, 77326-77328, 77331,
77750, 77751-77799, C1715-C1719, C1728, C2632C2636, and Q3001; ICD-9 code 92.28 and 92.29)
within the first year after diagnosis. Nonaggressive treatment was defined as watchful waiting, active surveillance
with or without treatment, or immediate or delayed
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).
Watchful waiting was defined as no aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation, or brachytherapy according
to MEDPAR claims within the first year after diagnosis
and no use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing
(CPT codes 84152-84154; Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System [HCPCS] code G0103) or transrectal ultrasound-guided rebiopsy (CPT codes 55700,
76942, 76872, and 55706) during the period of followup. Active surveillance without treatment was defined by
the use of PSA testing or transrectal ultrasound-guided
rebiopsy (the same CPT/HCPCS codes indicated above)
after diagnosis without aggressive treatment (surgery,
radiation, or brachytherapy) according to MEDPAR
claims over the period of follow-up. Active surveillance
with treatment was defined similarly, except that men
received aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation, or
brachytherapy according to MEDPAR claims more than
1 year after diagnosis. Immediate/delayed ADT was defined
as treatment with androgen deprivation (CPT-4 codes
11980, C9216, C9430, J141, J0970, J1000, J1056,
J1380, J1390, J1950, J3315, J9202, J9217, J9218,
J9219, S0165, and S9560; ICD-9 code 99.24) or bilateral
orchiectomy (CPT-4 codes 54250, 54251, 54522,
54530, and 54535; ICD-9 codes 62.3, 62.4, 62.41, and
62.42) within/after 1 year of diagnosis according to
MEDPAR claims.
Survival and Cause of Death

Overall survival was calculated as the date of diagnosis to
the date of death as determined by the Patient Entitlement
and Diagnosis Summary File. Other-cause and cancerspecific mortality were defined by their respective designations in SEER.

Statistical Analysis

We first compared the characteristics of our sample across
treatment type using the chi-square test. We then calculated propensity scores for the receipt of aggressive treatment using logistic regression analysis. Our propensity
models included tumor grade, tumor stage, race, age, marital status, and zip code of residence. To validate our propensity adjustment models, we calculated c-indices and
reported the covariate balance after inverse probability
weighting using the propensity score.
To determine whether comorbidity attenuates the
cancer-specific mortality benefit of aggressive treatment, we
created propensity-adjusted, competing-risks regression
models predicting cancer-specific mortality within comorbidity subgroups. Competing-risks analysis was performed
as described by Fine and Gray.18 Competing-risks regression accounts for occurrences of a competing event when
calculating relative hazards of outcome and also allows for
projection of the subhazard distribution onto a cumulativeincidence function. For this analysis, our primary predictor
was aggressive treatment, the failure event was cancer-specific
mortality, and the competing event was other-cause mortality.
Our model adjusted for tumor grade, tumor stage, race, age
at diagnosis, marital status, zip code of residence, aggressive/nonaggressive treatment type, and propensity score for
receipt of aggressive treatment. This analysis was completed
across the entire cohort in aggregate and in Charlson score
subgroups (0, 1, 2, and 3). We then reran the models in
the subgroup of men with well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated tumors.
Next, we calculated the risk of prostate cancerspecific mortality in aggressively and nonaggressively
treated men across comorbidity subgroups. To do this, we
used competing-risks regression analysis to project the cumulative incidence of cancer-specific mortality by aggressive and nonaggressive treatment for each comorbidity
subgroup. We repeated this analysis in the subgroup of
men with well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated
tumors.
We then characterized longitudinal other-cause
mortality rates based on comorbidity burden at diagnosis
using competing-risks regression analysis. For this analysis, our primary predictor was the Charlson score at diagnosis, the failure event was other-cause mortality, and the
competing event was prostate cancer mortality. Our model
corrected for tumor grade, tumor stage, race, age at diagnosis, marital status, zip code of residence, aggressive/nonaggressive treatment type, and propensity score. We then
plotted the cumulative incidence of nonprostate cancer
mortality by Charlson score over time.

drastically improved, although age at diagnosis and certain subcategories of tumor classification/grade and
Charlson score still were not completely balanced.
Results of a multivariate, propensity-adjusted competing-risks regression model testing the association
between aggressive treatment and prostate cancer mortality are provided in Table 2. Across the entire cohort,
aggressive treatment was associated with lower risk of
cancer-specific mortality (subhazard ratio [SHR], 0.50;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.53). Among comorbidity subgroups, aggressive treatment was associated with
a significant reduction in the subhazard of prostate cancer
mortality for men with Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2 but
not for those with Charlson scores 3 (SHR, 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.62-1.18) (Table 2). Among men who had well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumors, aggressive treatment was associated with a lower subhazard of
cancer-specific mortality for those with Charlson scores of
0, 1, and 2 but not for those with Charlson scores 3
(SHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.70-1.89) (Table 2). Among subgroups defined by comorbidity and age (ages 66-69 years,
70-74 years, 75-79 years, and 80 years), aggressive treatment again was not associated with a significant reduction
in cancer-specific mortality for men with Charlson scores
3 (data not shown).
Comparisons of 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year cumulative incidence of prostate cancer mortality between men
who received aggressive treatment and nonaggressive
treatment are provided in Table 3. The 15-year absolute
risk reduction in cancer-specific mortality associated with
aggressive treatment diminished with worse comorbidity
burden at diagnosis. Across the entire cohort, the absolute
risk reduction in 15-year cancer-specific mortality
between those treated aggressively and nonaggressively
2436

was 6.1%, 4.3%, 3.9%, and 0.9% for men with Charlson
scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 3). When
considering only well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumors, the absolute reduction in cancerspecific mortality dropped to 3.8%, 3%, 1.9%, and
20.5%, respectively (Table 3).
A multivariate competing-risks regression model
predicting other-cause mortality by Charlson score
revealed that the risk of other-cause mortality was significantly greater with worse comorbidity burden at diagnosis
(Fig. 1). Across the entire cohort, men who had Charlson
scores of 1 (SHR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.59-1.67), 2 (SHR,
2.13; 95% CI, 2.01-2.26), and 3 (SHR, 3.11; 95% CI,
2.81-3.45) had a significantly higher subhazard of othercause death compared with men who had Charlson scores
of 0. At 10 years after diagnosis, the cumulative incidence
of other-cause mortality among men who had Charlson
scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was 45%, 62%, 72%, and 84%,
respectively. These estimates did not differ when considered in the subgroup of men who had well-differentiated
or moderately-differentiated tumors.
DISCUSSION
Because prostate cancer is often an indolent disease affecting older men, many of those who are diagnosed with
early-stage disease will not live long enough to benefit
from aggressive treatment.2-6 Previous arguments advocating for conservative management of older men with
multiple comorbidities have relied on a common-sense rationale: that older, sicker men have an outsize likelihood
of other-cause mortality and a minimal risk of prostate
cancer mortality.2,6 In the current study, we sought to
determine whether the overwhelming competing risk of
other-cause mortality would dilute the cancer-specific survival benefit of treatment for men with multiple comorbidities at diagnosis, since most do not live long enough
to incur substantial mortality from their disease and therefore do not have the opportunity to reap survival benefits
from potentially curative treatment. Our results confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that for men with
Charlson scores 3, there was no significant reduction in
cancer-specific mortality associated with aggressive treatment. By defining clear cutoff levels for treatment effectiveness, this information may help clinicians feel more
confident in recommending nonaggressive treatment for
older, sicker men with early-stage disease.
To provide further context for this argument, we
also demonstrated that the absolute risk reduction in
cancer-specific mortality associated with aggressive over
nonaggressive treatment is exceedingly small compared

with the risk of other-cause mortality for older men who
have multiple comorbidities. For example, among men
with Charlson scores 3, the 10-year cumulative incidence of other-cause mortality was 84%, whereas the 15year absolute risk reduction in prostate cancer mortality
between those treated aggressively versus nonaggressively
was only 0.9% for all tumors and 20.5% for well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated tumors. Among
men with Charlson scores of 2, the 10-year cumulative
incidence of other-cause mortality was 72%, and the 15year absolute risk reduction with aggressive treatment was
3.9% for all tumors and 1.9% for well-differentiated or
moderately-differentiated tumors. Understanding the
absolute risk reduction associated with aggressive treatment is critical to improving the quality of decisionmaking, because statistically significant relative reductions

absolute reductions in mortality. Even healthier men aged

treatment have only modest reductions in cancer-specific
mortality, underscoring the need for shared decisionmaking with transparent communication of treatment
effectiveness and competing risks for mortality.
The question of whether aggressive treatment is
equally effective in older men with differing comorbid
disease burdens has been addressed inadequately in
randomized controlled trials. The Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), which compared surgery with observation, revealed a nonsignificant
reduction in the risk of cancer-specific mortality with surgery both for men with Charlson scores of 0 (hazard ratio,
0.69; 95% CI, 0.34-1.37) and for men with Charlson
scores 1 (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.21-1.38), but
that study was not powered to detect differences of this
magnitude within subgroups and did not separately consider subgroups of men with Charlson scores >1.19 The
Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 randomized controlled trial, which compared surgery with watchful waiting, did not consider treatment effectiveness in
comorbidity subgroups.1 We used a propensity-weighted
approach to mitigate the selection bias associated with our
observational study design (ie, that men who receive
aggressive treatment are healthier and may be more likely
to reap survival benefits). We were able to overcome this
bias favoring treatment to demonstrate a lack of treatment
benefit for men with the highest Charlson scores, which
speaks to the strength of this variable in predicting treatment benefit.
Our data may help to clarify existing American Urological Association, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and European Association of Urology guidelines
regarding triage of treatment for men with early-stage
prostate cancer in the setting of limited life expectancy.
Although all of these guidelines recommend against
aggressive treatment for men with less than a 10-year life
expectancy,7-9 adherence to these recommendations has
lagged9 for several reasons, including lack of a widely
accepted method for evaluating life expectancy that incorporates both age and health status and because there are
limited data comparing the effectiveness of aggressive and
nonaggressive treatment strategies for these men. The
work presented here may assist in the operationalization of
these guidelines by validating previous population-based
estimates of long-term, other-cause mortality according to
comorbidity status4-6 and by providing evidence that older
men with significant comorbidity burdens at diagnosis
may not benefit from aggressive treatment.
Our study has limitations that may affect generalizability the results. First, the lack of PSA data and inconsis2438

tent definitions of tumor grade in SEER do not allow for
precise definitions of tumor risk, like those in the widely
recognized D’Amico20 or National Comprehensive Cancer Network8 tumor-risk paradigms. We attempted to
mitigate this limitation by considering our outcomes in a
subgroup of men with well- and moderately-differentiated
disease as well as in those with all tumor grades, including
poorly differentiated tumors. Although we observed a lack
of treatment benefit in the sickest men even when including those with high-grade tumors, this finding should be
tempered by the fact that cancer mortality risk in the
entire cohort is driven by the more prevalent low-grade
and intermediate-grade tumors. Second, assessment of
comorbidity status using claims data may not be accurate
compared with manual chart abstraction or physician/
patient report, although numerous studies have demonstrated that claims-based comorbidity assessment is comparable.21 Third, propensity-adjusted analyses may not
adequately adjust for endogeneity of health status between
men treated aggressively and nonaggressively, resulting in
an overestimate of the treatment benefit associated with
aggressive treatment (because men who receive aggressive
treatment tend to be healthier).22 However, this bias
would make it harder to prove our hypothesis that sicker
men do not benefit from treatment; therefore, our findings provide an a fortiori argument for the validity of these
claims in a real-world context. Fourth, because sample
size decreases with increasing comorbidity, our power to
detect significant differences in cancer mortality between
those treated aggressively and nonaggressively is diminished in the sickest men. However, the low ratio of the
number of model variables to the number of failure events
suggests that we are adequately powered to detect the
observed effect sizes; this is supported by the relatively
tight confidence intervals observed in our prediction
models. Finally, because treatment paid for through other
insurers is not captured in the SEER-Medicare data set,
the frequency of aggressive treatment may be underestimated, and watchful waiting/active surveillance may be
overestimated.
Our study provides evidence that the cancer-specific
survival benefit of aggressive treatment wanes with
increasing comorbidity burden at diagnosis. We demonstrated that aggressive treatment appears to be ineffective
at reducing cancer-specific mortality for older men with
Charlson scores >3. In addition, we demonstrated that
the risk of other-cause mortality far outweighs the absolute risk reduction associated with aggressive over nonaggressive treatment in these older, sicker men. We hope
that this information will empower clinicians to make

better treatment decisions for these men, because current
data suggest that they are often over treated with potentially morbid aggressive therapies.
