ABSTRACT
A better understanding of the dynamics of molecular changes occurring during
the early stages of oral tumorigenesis may help refine prevention and treatment
strategies. We generated genome-wide expression profiles of microdissected normal
mucosa, hyperplasia, dysplasia and tumors derived from the 4-NQO mouse model
of oral tumorigenesis. Genes differentially expressed between tumor and normal
mucosa defined the “tumor gene set” (TGS), including 4 non-overlapping gene subsets
that characterize the dynamics of gene expression changes through different stages
of disease progression. The majority of gene expression changes occurred early or
progressively. The relevance of these mouse gene sets to human disease was tested
in multiple datasets including the TCGA and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
project. The TGS was able to discriminate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) from
normal oral mucosa in 3 independent datasets. The OSCC samples enriched in the
mouse TGS displayed high frequency of CASP8 mutations, 11q13.3 amplifications and
low frequency of PIK3CA mutations. Early changes observed in the 4-NQO model were
associated with a trend toward a shorter oral cancer-free survival in patients with
oral preneoplasia that was not seen in multivariate analysis. Progressive changes
observed in the 4-NQO model were associated with an increased sensitivity to 4
different MEK inhibitors in a panel of 51 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines of the
aerodigestive tract. In conclusion, the dynamics of molecular changes in the 4-NQO

models of aerodigestive SCC. The study of the dynamics of
gene expression changes during oral tumorigenesis may help
refine prevention and treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Personalization of prevention strategies may allow
the decrease of morbidity and mortality of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the second
most common smoking-related cancer after lung cancer
[1]. Previous reports on head and neck premalignancy
and chemoprevention have focused on oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common anatomical
site of HNSCC. Although prospective evaluations of
chemopreventive agents have not yet resulted in the
development of an intervention that can be considered
as standard of care, they allowed the identification of
new biomarkers of OSCC risk in patients with oral
premalignant lesions (OPL), the most validated one being
loss of heterozygosities (LOH) at various sites [2–4].
Despite those efforts, the natural history of OPL
remains poorly understood, as they may persist for years,
regress spontaneously or after tobacco or alcohol cessation,
or evolve into invasive SCC in about 20% cases over periods
of up to 30 years [5–8]. A comprehensive characterization
of the molecular changes occurring in OPL may improve
our understanding of their natural history [7–10]. We have
previously shown that gene expression profiles of OPL may
improve the prediction of oral cancer [11]. However, the
study was limited to patients treated with retinoids and to
the analysis of a single baseline biopsy, which did not allow
us to appreciate the dynamics of gene expression changes
over time.
In order to address these limitations and to identify
key molecular changes leading to the development of
cancer, we sought to characterize the dynamics of gene
expression changes in the 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)
mouse model of human oral carcinogenesis that leads to the
development of malignant SCC preceded by preneoplastic
histological changes such as hyperplasia and dysplasia [12–
16]. Progression of premalignant pathologic stages has been
well described in this model [14], showing hyperplasia at first
weeks after 4-NQO administration and then an increasing
percentage of dysplasia and tumors, reproducing the
multi-step tumor process observed in humans. This model
represents a relevant model of human SCC as it is associated
with genetic alterations similar to those observed with
smoking exposure in HNSCC (i.e. EGFR overexpression)
[13, 16]. However, the 4-NQO mouse model has not
been extensively characterized at the molecular level.
In the present study, we characterized genomewide expression changes in the 4-NQO mouse model
and identified gene sets specific of sequential histological
changes and demonstrated the relevance of those changes
in human OSCC. An integrative analysis of the TCGA data
showed that the 4-NQO model may represent a specific
molecularly-defined subgroup of OSCC, and may be
associated with patterns of drug sensitivity in human in vitro

RESULTS
Dynamics of gene expression changes during
oral tumorigenesis in the 4-NQO mouse model
Nine mice treated by the 4 NQO as described
elsewhere [14] and three control mice (non-treated) were
selected for transcriptomic analysis. Total RNA extraction
was performed from microdissected epithelial cells of
tongue mucosa, including 3 normal mucosa from control
mice (week 12, 20, and 24), 3 hyperplastic lesions (1
at week 16 and 2 at week 20), 3 dysplastic lesions (2 at
week16, 1 at week 24) and 3 tumor samples (at week 16,
20 and 24) from the 4-NQO treated mice (Figure 1A).
Median RIN was 7.55 (range 4.6-9.2) with no significant
difference between normal, hyperplastic, dysplastic and
tumor samples. RNA concentration ranged between 0.5
and 5.7 ng/μL, with a median of 1.2 ng/μL. All of the 12
samples passed the quality controls, were amplified and
arrays were hybridized on Mouse Gene ST 2.0 Arrays. The
technical information is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.
A principal component analysis (PCA) of the
12 samples using whole-genome expression profiles
demonstrated strong patterns of normal mucosa,
hyperplastic, dysplastic and tumors lesions as shown in
Figure 1B. We then identified several sets of genes that
were associated with histological changes (Figure 1A).
Differential expression was defined by an absolute log2
fold-change (FC) >1. Each gene set was divided into an
“UP” version for genes upregulated (log2 FC > 1) and a
down (DN) version for genes downregulated (log2 FC <-1),
respectively. Five mouse gene sets were defined and human
orthologous genes were identified for each gene set, using
the JAX and HUGO orthology resources [17, 18]. We first
identified a set of genes differentially expressed between
tumor and normal mucosa that we called the “tumor gene
set” (TGS). TGS included 584 and 753 mouse genes that
were up- and down-regulated genes in tumors, respectively,
and that correspond to 514 and 508 human orthologous
genes respectively (Supplementary Table 2). A PCA of the
12 samples using TGS demonstrated a similar pattern as
the one observed using whole-genome expression profiles
(Supplementary Figure 1A).
In order to capture the dynamics of gene expression
changes during oral tumorigenesis, we subsequently
divided the TGS set into four non-overlapping gene
subsets: the “early” (EGS), the “intermediate” (IGS) and
the “late” (LGS) gene subsets, which represented the
changes observed at each step of oral tumorigenesis (i.e.
hyperplasia vs. normal mucosa, dysplasia vs. hyperplasia

performed to determine whether an a priori defined set of
genes showed statistically significant differences between
tumor vs normal samples [19]. The log2 FC was used to
successively analyze a total of 4,722 “curated gene sets”
(C2) and 189 “oncogenic signatures” (C6) available from
the MSigDB [19]. The most significant gene sets with a
positive enrichment score among “curated gene sets” were
related to proliferation and cell cycle (Supplementary
Figure 1B). EGFR and VEGF pathways were the most
significantly enriched gene sets with a positive score,
among the 189 “oncogenic signatures” (Supplementary
Figure 1C).
We then used the single sample GSEA (ssGSEA)
[19, 20] to compute an enrichment score (ES) for the
four subsets (EGS, IGS, LGS and PGS) in each of the 12

and tumor vs. dysplasia respectively). Genes included
in EGS, IGS and LGS were differentially expressed at
a given stage of oral tumorigenesis but not differentially
expressed at any previous stage. The fourth gene subset,
“progressive” gene set (PGS), represented changes
acquired progressively during each step, that reached
an absolute log2 FC > 1 in tumor vs. normal mucosa,
but did not reach this FC at any individual steps of oral
tumorigenesis (Supplementary Table 3). EGS and PGS
included the largest number of genes (Supplementary
Table 2). Details of the genes included in each gene set
are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
In order to gain insight on the biological significance
of genes differentially expressed in mice tumors vs. normal
mucosa, a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was

and tumor (T-D) (see Material and Methods section). D. Enrichment scores for EGS, IGS, LGS and PGS gene subsets were correlated with
enrichment scores for 208 BIOCARTA pathways (see Material and Methods section); pathways with the strongest correlation at each step

mouse samples. The specificity of each gene subset for
a given stage of oral tumorigenesis was confirmed by an
enrichment rate calculated for each gene subset at each
step, using the formula: |Δ GeneSet Score (Stepn-Stepn-1)|
/ |ΔGene Set score (Tumor-Nal)|. The rates of enrichment
score for ESG, IGS, and LGS were 80%, 97% and 78%,
respectively (Figure 1C). In contrast, the rate of ES of the
PGS was well distributed across different steps of oral
tumorigenesis (24%, 29% and 47%).
In order to test the biological significance of EGS,
IGS, LGS and PGS in the 12 mouse samples, we computed
their enrichment score and tested their correlation with the
enrichment score for 208 Biocarta pathways. We found
15 pathways correlated with at least one gene set using
a P <0.01 (see Supplementary Tables 5 and 6) (Figure
1D). Two of the pathways involve the mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways. The first one,
“NTHI”, corresponds to an inflammatory response through
the activation of NF-κB and p38/MAPK and was mostly
correlated with EGS (r=0.73, P=0.0070). The second
pathway, “TNFR1”, involves apoptosis and the JNK/
MAPK pathway, and was mostly correlated with LGS (r=
0.79, P=0.0023). Additional pathways correlated with the
gene subsets were immune-related. “CCR5” and “NKT”
were mostly correlated with the IGS (r=0.81, P=0.0016
and r=0.75, P=0.0053 respectively) while “IL4” pathway
was highly correlated with EGS (r=0.86, P=0.0003),
IGS (r=0.81, P=0.0014) and PGS (r=0.85, P=0.0005).
Apoptosis was represented by “DEATH” and “FREE”
pathways, mostly correlated with EGS (r=0.74, P=0.0061
and r=0.81, P=0.0013 respectively) and PGS (r=0.76,
P=0.0041 and r=0.72, P=0.0078 respectively).

We then computed the enrichment score (ES) of each
sample for the TGS using ssGSEA and consistently
found higher ES in cancer vs. normal mucosa samples
in GSE30784 (Figure 2C) and GSE9844 (Figure 2D).
Interestingly, dysplasia had intermediate scores, some of
them overlapping with tumors, while others overlapped
with normal mucosa (Figure 2C). These results were
validated in a TCGA set [23] of 221 OSCC and 24 normal
mucosa samples (Figure 2E). 4-NQO is a DNA adductforming agent that serves as a surrogate of tobacco
exposure. Interestingly, we evidenced that TGS ES scores
were higher in smokers and drinkers (SD) compared to
never-smokers and never drinkers (NSND) (P=0.0400)
(Supplementary Figure 2).
We then tested whether the 4-NQO model was
representing a subgroup of OSCC. For this purpose,
we performed an analysis integrating gene expression,
mutation and copy number (CN) data available for 152
patients with OSCC in the TCGA. Although TGS ES
was not associated with the percent of malignant cells,
OSCC tumors were ranked according to the TGS ES
(Figure 3). Tumors enriched for TGS were associated with
copy number gains in 11q13.3, a region that includes in
particular FADD, MIR548K and PPFIA13. A significant
correlation was found between the TGS ES and FADD
absolute CN (r=0.27, P=0.0007) (data not shown). Using
an absolute CN > 3 to define an amplification, we showed
that OSCC harboring FADD amplification had a significant
higher TGS score (P=0.0039). Furthermore, higher TGS
ES were observed in OSCC from patients with CASP8
mutations (P=0.0595) and WT PIK3CA (P=0.0319)
(Figure 3B, 3C, 3D).

The 4-NQO model derived TGS discriminates
OSCC from normal mucosa and identifies OSCC
with specific genomic alterations

The 4-NQO derived gene sets and their
association with drug sensitivity patterns in vitro
We then investigated whether cell lines enriched
for the 4-NQO derived gene sets were associated with
specific patterns of drug sensitivity. For this, we used
gene expression and drug sensitivity data downloaded
from “The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer”
(GDSC) project [24, 25]. We selected cell lines established
from SCC of the head and neck, esophagus and lung
because they are included in the same cancerization field
associated with cigarette smoking and they share common
genomic alterations (Supplementary Table 8). EGS, IGS,
LGS and PGS enrichment scores were computed in a
total of 51 SCC cell lines and were correlated with the
IC50 of 98 drugs. With a cut-off P-value of less than 0.01,
we identified 14 drugs negatively correlated with at least
one of the 4-NQO-derived gene sets. Most of them were
inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway and of the cell cycle
(Figure 4A). The PGS ES was correlated with sensitivity
to a variety of drugs. Those included an mTOR inhibitor
(AMPK agonist) and an EGFR inhibitor (gefitinib), two
targets that have been previously reported to prevent

In order to test the relevance of the 4-NQO model
in human disease, we first determined whether the TGS
was able to discriminate cancer vs. normal tissues in three
datasets downloaded from public repositories, using arraybased or RNAseq expression profiles (Supplementary
Table 7). A PCA and unsupervised hierarchical cluster
analysis was performed using the TGS in two independent
human datasets: GSE9844 [21] and GSE30784 [22]. Two
main clusters were observed in GSE30784 (Figure 2A):
the first one included no normal samples (0/45), 89%
(151/169) of tumor samples and 59% (10/17) of dysplastic
samples, whereas the second one included all normal
samples (45/45), 11% (18/169) of tumor samples and
41% (7/17) of dysplastic samples (Fisher’s exact test
P<0.0001). Similar results were obtained in GSE9844
(Figure 2B) with one cluster including 92% (24/26) of
OSCC of the tongue and no normal mucosa, while the
other one included 8% (2/26) of OSCC of the tongue and
all the normal samples (Fisher’s exact test P<0.0001).

oral cancer development in the 4-NQO model [26, 27].
Interestingly, all four MEK1/2 inhibitors included in the
panel of 98 drugs were significantly correlated with the
ES for EGS, IGS and PGS subsets (Figure 4A). Consistent
with the results obtained in the TCGA OSCC dataset
(Figure 3A), and using drug sensitivity and CNA data
from CCLE [28], we observed a trend for association of
copy number gain in 11q13.3 with increased sensitivity to
the two MEK1/2 inhibitors (PD-0325901 and AZD6244)
(Figure 4B) tested in 37 head and neck, esophagus and
lung cell lines (Supplementary Table 8). Considering cell
lines with IC50 below 8μM to be sensitive to PD-0325901
and cell lines with IC50 above 8μM to be resistant to PD0325901, we found higher miR548K copy number in
sensitive cell lines (P=0.0421) (Figure 4C).

Finally, we tested whether patients with OPL (oral
premalignant lesions) enriched for 4-NQO derived gene
subsets were at higher risk of developing OSCC. Gene
expression profiles of 86 OPL collected in a prospective
cohort of 86 patients were used (GSE26549) [11]. In this
study, 35 patients developed an OSCC as the median
follow-up was 7 years (95% CI [5.6-8.6]). Enrichment
scores of these 86 OPL were computed for TGS, EGS,
IGS, LGS, and PGS. For each gene subset, 3 groups of
patients were defined by dividing the ES into tertiles (low,
intermediate, high score). The Kaplan Meier analysis
revealed a tendency of association between a poor OCFS

was given by a Mann Whitney test D and E. or a Kruskal-Wallis test (C). We observed a significant difference (P<0.0001) between ES of
normal, dysplastic and tumor samples in all datasets.

and higher ES for the EGS (Log-rank test p=0.0529) and
PGS (Log-rank test p= 0.0495) (Figure 5). No significant
association was found between OCFS and TGS, IGS and
LGS (Supplementary Figure 3). (page 8)
Although univariate Cox analyses suggested a
prognostic effect on OCFS of EGS ES (HR High vs Low
=2.997 [1.149-7.816]; HR Intermediate vs Low=2.64
[1.013-6.878], p=0.0681) and PGS ES (HR High vs Low
=1.711 [0.790-3.707]; HR Intermediate vs Low=0.604
[0.233-1.562], p=0.0681) respectively, multivariate
analyses failed to confirm these results once adjusted on
age and histology (Supplementary Table 9).

In the 4-NQO model, enrichment of the NFKB
pathway was observed at early stages, and the activation
of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, was enriched at both
early (significant enrichment of the NTHI pathway) and
late (significant enrichment of the TNFR1 pathway) stages
(Figure 6A). Consistently, we found that in vitro (Figure
6B), sensitivity to inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK or NFKB
pathways (IKK) were correlated to the ES of 4-NQOderived gene subsets. Similarly, IL4 pathway, that involves
activation of the cell cycle, was found to be enriched in the

and in vivo datasets, we have shown that the 4-NQO is
a relevant mouse model for human OSCC with frequent
CASP8 mutations and amplifications at 11q13.3, that may
be sensitive to MEK inhibition. This work is in line with a
recent observation of cross-species genomic conservation
between preclinical models of HNSCC and HNSCC in
humans [29]. We also illustrate the value of studying
preclinical models of early tumorigenesis to help defining
new strategies for prevention and therapy of HNSCC.
CASP8 mutations have been reported in 8-10%
HNSCC [30–32]. They are considered as either lossof-function through suppression of apoptosis initiated
by this apoptosis related-gene [30], or gain-of-function
mutations conferring resistance to death receptor, or
enhancing migration, invasion and tumor growth in vitro

4-NQO model, consistent with the efficacy of CDK4/6,
CDK1, and AURKB/C inhibitors cell cycle inhibitors
in vitro. A trend toward association of EGS and PGS
with a poor OCFS is in favour of the clinical relevance
of association of EGS and PGS with these biological
pathways (Figure 6C). Finally, three pathways involving
apoptosis were found to be enriched in the 4-NQO model,
which was consistent with frequent FADD CN gains and
CASP8 mutations in OSCC enriched in TGS (Figure 6D).

by projecting those changes in various human in vitro

targets have not been reported. Targeting MIR548K may
be relevant in the context of chemoprevention of tumors
included in the same cancerization field.
The association between the enrichment mousederived gene subsets in OPLs validates the relevance of
the 4-NQO model for the study of new chemoprevention
agents. We observed a trend in association of the EGS
and OCFS, suggesting that the key molecular events
occur early during oral tumorigenesis. This observation is
consistent with our previous report of a strong association
between gene expression changes in OPL and the risk
of developing OSCC, beyond clinical and pathological
variables, including histological changes [11].
Beyond risk assessment, we seek to identify new
candidate drugs for chemoprevention. The concept of field
cancerization refers to the effects of chronic exposure to
smoking and alcohol in patients with or without cancer,
with progressive onset of molecular alterations in initially
histologically and clinically normal epithelia [37]. The
observation of the authors was that the grossly normal
epithelium adjacent to the invasive carcinoma frequently
demonstrated dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. Later,
the concept of field cancerization was supported by the
identification of similar genetic alterations in matched

[32]. CASP8 has been associated with HRAS mutations
[31] and seems to define a subgroup of HPV-negative oral
cancers recently identified by the presence of activating
mutations in HRAS, inactivating CAPS8 mutations and
wild type TP53 [33]. In our analysis, TCGA tumors
enriched for the 4-NQO TGS were less frequently mutated
for PIK3CA; which goes in line with the fact that PIK3CA
mutations are found in 6-11% HNSCC, mostly in HPVpositive and especially in pharyngeal cancers [33–35].
These observations suggest that CASP8 mutations may
be involved in smoking-related tumorigenesis of the oral
cavity, while PI3KCA may be more frequently involved in
OSCC developing in the population of never smokers. The
4-NQO model may be pertinent to smoking-associated
OSCC, but is likely not relevant to OSCC affecting nonsmokers or HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC.
Amplification in 11q13.3 was another genomic
feature associated with OSCC enriched for the 4-NQO
derived TGS. This region includes MIR548K, a microRNA
recently characterized as a novel oncogene in esophageal
squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC), a tumor entity that
shares common risk factors and genomic alterations with
HNSCC [36]. Depletion of MIR548K has been shown
to suppress cellular growth and mobility, although its

(P=0.0495) were associated with poor oral cancer-free survival. Statistical significance was given by the log-rank test.

The use of molecular markers has validated the concept
of field cancerization. Within the context of the recently
proposed paradigm termed “reverse migration”, we tested
the association between the enrichment of SCC cell
lines for mouse-derived gene sets with drug sensitivity
in order to identify new candidate drugs that may also
benefit patients in the context of prevention [38, 39].
We took advantage of the resources available from the
GDSC project. We selected SCC cell lines from various
anatomical sites, including the head and neck, esophagus
and lung because they were all established from tumors

included in the cancerization field. Most significant
correlations were observed with inhibitors of the MAPK/
ERK pathway and of the cell cycle. This was consistent
with the results of the GSEA analysis in mouse showing
a significant enrichment of gene sets involved in cell
cycle and proliferation in agreement with a recent Gene
Ontology analysis in the 4-NQO model [40]. The MAPK/
ERK pathway includes many targetable kinases [41].
Interestingly, the ES for the PGS was associated with
sensitivity to number of drugs, particularly inhibitors of the
MAPK pathway including AZD6244 (MEK1/2), CI-1040
(MEK1/2), SL0101-1 (RSK, AURKB, PIM3), RDEA119

Figure 6: Overview of the dynamic expression changes observed in the 4-NQO model projected in pathways pertinent
to human oral preneoplasia (OPL) and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This figure shows the coherence between main
molecular events occurring in the 4-NQO mouse model (EGS, IGS, LGS, PGS) and those involved in human oral preneoplasia and
OSCC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), apoptosis, cell cycle, and the nuclear factor NF-κB (NFKB) pathways are dysregulated
during oral tumorigenesis and were found to be correlated (p<0.01) with one or more of mouse gene subsets as indicated by blue (PGS),
green (EGS), red (LGS) and turquoise (IGS) arrows respectively (A). Those correlations were consistent with drug sensitivity patterns in
established squamous cell carcinoma cell lines; corresponding targets are highlighted (yellow) within the pathways A, B. Patients whom
OPL were enriched for the mouse EGS were at increased risk of developing OSCC (borderline statistical significance) C. OSCC enriched
for the mouse TGS harbor genomic features (amplification region 11q13) that may be associated with increased sensitivity to MEK1/2
inhibitors D. Abbreviations: TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas; GDSC: Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer; EGS: Early Gene Subset;

(MEK1/ 2), PD-0325901 (MEK1/2) and gefitinib (EGFR)
targeting members of this signaling cascade. Some may
affect predominantly the MAPK/ERK pathway while
others affect the MAPK/JNK pathway, confirming that
MAPK in an important node in OSCC. Although difficult
in the prevention setting, combination therapies may
help addressing the challenge of acquired resistance to
EGFR inhibition for patients with HNSCC [42]. These
observations suggest that MEK1/2 inhibition may be
of interest to prevent OPL malignant transformation
or to treat OSCC harboring CASP8 mutation and/or an
amplification at 11q13.3. Of note, our study was based on
the analysis of a small number of mouse samples that may
have hindered other significant pathways involved during
oral tumorigenesis.
In conclusion, the study of the dynamics of
molecular changes in the 4-NQO mouse model is relevant
to identify new strategies for both the prevention of
oral cancer development and the treatment of OSCC. In
particular, MEK1/2 inhibition may be of interest to prevent
the development of OSCC in patients with OPL or to treat
patients with OSCC harboring a CASP8 mutation and/or
amplification at 11q13.3.

enlarged nuclei and cells, large and/or prominent nucleoli,
increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromatic
nuclei, dyskeratosis, increased and/or abnormal mitotic
figures, bulbous or teardrop-shaped rete ridges, loss of
polarity, and loss of typical epithelial cell cohesiveness.
As proposed by Hasina et al [14], the degree of dysplasia
was not considered as it can be difficult even in human
preneoplasia, with a high interobserver and intraobserver
discordance rate [14, 44]. Biological triplicates of normal
mucosa, hyperplasia, dysplasia and tumor from 3 different
mice were selected for subsequent steps. Only typical
pathological diagnoses were selected from mice that
were sacrified at different time points, in order to avoid a
potential bias due to the biological effect of age.
In order to limit our study to changes occurring in
epithelial cells, we used an infrared laser microdissection
system (Arcturus PixCell II®, Life Technologies, NY,
USA) to isolate tongue epithelial cells from the underlying
stroma and muscle. For microdissection, the 12-μm
sections were stained with cresyl violet (Ambion® LCM
staining kit, Life Technologies) that allows to preserve
RNA quality. Microdissected cells on the cap were
solubilized using a RLT lysis buffer and were subjected to
total RNA extraction.
Total RNA extraction was carried out using the
RNeasy Microkit® (Qiagen) and included an on-column
DNase digestion. The RNA integrity number (RIN) was
measured to evaluate the quality and quantity of each RNA
sample, using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA
6000 Pico Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Aliquots of
RNA for genome-wide transcriptome analysis were prepared
at the time of extraction. A total of 2 ng was used for RNA
amplification using Ovation Pico WTA System v2 (NuGEN
Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA). Each amplified sense
cDNA product was fragmented and biotinylated, using
an Encore Biotin Module according to manufacturer’s
instructions (NuGEN Technologies). Each sample was
hybridized onto a GeneChip Mouse Gene ST 2.0 Array
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and imaged using the
GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). Raw data were
deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE75421).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse specimens
The animal protocol was approved by the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Animal Care
and Use Committee. A total of 52 male CBA mice were
included in the study. 4-NQO was administered in half
of them in their drinking water at the dose of 100 μg/
mL for 8 weeks as described elsewhere [14]. Drink water
was changed every week. Four mice treated with 4-NQO
and four control mice were sacrificed every four weeks.
Immediately following death, tongues were excised,
longitudinally bisected, each half of the tongue was frozen
on dry ice, embedded in OCT and stored at -80°C. By
week 24, experiment was completed.
Sections of mouse tongues allowed to identify
histologic changes associated with oral tumorigenesis
including normal mucosa in untreated mice tongue, and
hyperplasia, dysplasia, and tumor in 4-NQO treated mice
tongue. Sections were 12 μm thick with a 6 μm section
every 10 sections; all were stored at -80°C in order to
preserve RNA quality. A half-tongue required about
100 slides with 2 sections per slide to be fully analyzed.
Thinner sections were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained
with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) for a precise mapping
of pathological changes by a veterinary pathologist
(A.T.). Criteria used for histologic diagnoses were similar
to those established in human [43]. Hyperplasia was
defined by a thickened keratinized layer, with or without
a thickened spinous layer (acanthosis), and an absence
of nuclear or cellular atypia. Dysplasia was defined by

Human datasets downloaded from public
repositories for in silico analysis
Raw data of 3 independent datasets were
downloaded from GEO. These included a set of 26
microdissected OSCC of the mobile tongue and 12
matching normal mucosa (GSE9844) [21]; a set of 167
OSCC, 17 unpaired oral dysplasia, and 45 oral cavity
or oropharynx normal mucosa collected in patients
who underwent a surgery for diseases other than
cancer (GSE30784) [22]; and a set of 86 expression
profiles from OPL biopsies collected prospectively in a
chemoprevention trial, with a median follow-up of 7 years
35941

Oncotarget

(95% CI [5.6-8.6]) and available outcome (GSE26549)
[11]. A detailed description of these datasets is provided
in Supplementary Table 7.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was queried
[23] (last query in July 2014). Clinical and pathological
information from 221 HPV negative OSCC and 24
matching normal oral mucosa were downloaded. Level 3
RNAseqv2 data were downloaded, corresponding to gene
read counts that were generated from the IlluminaHiSeq
platform and normalized using MapSplice [45] to do the
alignment and RSEM [46] to perform the quantitation.
Then a log2 transformation was performed. Mutation and
copy number (CN) data were downloaded from cBioPortal
[47]. Among genes found to be significantly mutated
by MutSig, we selected those mutated in at least 5% of
HNSCC. The putative copy number (-2, -1, 0, 1 or 2) and
the log2 CN given by GISTIC for 310 genes with recurrent
CN alterations (CNAs) in HNSCC were downloaded.
Combined mutation and CN data was available for 152
patients with OSCC.
Gene expression raw data for 51 cell lines as
well as drug sensitivity data (half maximal inhibitory
concentration, IC50) for 144 drugs tested in those cell lines
were downloaded as well from “The Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer” (GDSC) project [24, 25]. Combined
expression profiles and drug sensitivity data were available
for 98 drugs in 51 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines from
the head and neck (n=22), the esophagus (n=23) and the
lung (n=6). We also used drug sensitivity and copy number
alteration data of 37 cell lines from Cancer Cell Line
Encyplopedia [28]. Description of cell lines is provided in
Supplementary Table 8.

for GSEA procedure were the following: i-a complete
table of genes ranked according to the log2 transformed
FC between tumor and normal mucosa, ii-a mapping file
for identifying transcripts in the corresponding platform
(GeneChip Mouse Gene ST 2.0 Array), and iii-a catalogue
of functional gene sets from Molecular signature Database
(MSigDB database v4.0 updated May 31, 2013, GSEA/
MSigDB web site v4.02 released Jan 18, 2014). A total of
4722 curated gene sets (canonical pathway, chemical and
genetic perturbations, BioCarta, GenMAPP, and KEGG
gene sets) and 189 oncogenic signatures were available.
Default parameters were used. Inclusion gene set size was
set between 15 and 500 and the phenotype was permutated
1,000 times.
The single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) projection tool
from GenePattern [50] was used to compute separate
enrichment scores (ES) for each sample of a given dataset
using defined gene sets i.e. TGS, IGS, LGS, PGS subsets
and BioCarta pathways from the Molecular Signature
Database (MSigDB database v4.0 updated May 31, 2013;
v4.02 released Jan 18, 2014, ref 20). The gene expression
values for a given sample are rank-normalized, and an ES
is produced using the empirical cumulative distribution
functions of the genes in the gene set and the remaining
genes [19, 20]. When UP and DN versions of a gene set
are available, a combined score was computed. A rate of
ES was computed for early (EGS), intermediate (IGS),
late (LGS) and progressive (PGS) gene sets at each step
of oral tumorigenesis: from “normal to hyperplasia” (H>N), from “hyperplasia to dysplasia” (D->H), and from
“dysplasia to tumor” (T->D), using the following formula:
∆ Gene set score (Step n - Step n−1 )
∆ Gene set score (Tumor - N al )

Bioinformatics analysis
Data analysis was performed using the Array Studio
software (Omicsoft Corporation) and the Bioconductor
packages in the R language (http://www.bioconductor.
org) [48]. Raw data from microarrays were processed
using quantile normalization and the robust multi-array
average (RMA) algorithm and were log2 transformed
[49]. Hierarchical cluster analysis using the Pearson
correlation and Ward linkage method and principal
component analysis (PCA) using the first 2 components
were performed to provide an overview of the data and
visualize the distribution of various samples according
to the similarities between their expression profiles. Both
analyses used either genome-wide expression profiles or
specific gene sets as defined above.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was
performed using the “pre-ranked” tool [19]. GSEA is a
robust computational method that determines whether an
a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant
differences between 2 biological states (in our case tumor
vs. normal). GSEA aims to interpret large-scale expression
data by identifying pathways and process. The input data
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test or nonparametrical Mann-Whitney test were performed to
compare continuous data between two groups and oneway ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test if more than 2
groups. Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test were used
to analyze qualitative data. The Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (r) was also estimated to measure the strength
of a linear association between two continuous variables.
The r coefficient can take values from +1 (positive
association) to -1 (negative association). A value of 0
indicates no association.
About the analysis of the 86 samples from
GSE26549 dataset, the median follow-up was estimated
with the inversed Kaplan Meier method. Oral Cancer
Free Survival (OCFS) distributions were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the LogRank test between groups of patients defined by tertiles
of gene set enrichment scores (low, intermediate and high
score). OCFS was defined as time from first biopsy to
35942

oral cancer or to the date of last follow-up (for censored
patients). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional
hazard model, including age and histology, were built
to investigate the potential association between the ES
for TGS, EGS, IGS, LGS and PGS and oral cancer-free
survival. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P-values
<= 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
The statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 (San Diego, SA) and SAS
software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).
