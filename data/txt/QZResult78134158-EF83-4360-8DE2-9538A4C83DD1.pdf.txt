Abstract
Microtubules are centrally involved in cell division, being the
principal components of mitotic spindle. Tubulin, the constituent of microtubules, can be cyclically modified on its
A-subunit by enzymatic removal of the COOH-terminal
tyrosine residue by an ill-defined tubulin carboxypeptidase
(TCP) and its readdition by tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL). We
and others have previously shown that suppression of TTL and
resulting accumulation of detyrosinated tubulin are frequent
in human cancers of poor prognosis. Explanations for the
involvement of TTL and detyrosinated tubulin in tumor
progression arise from the recent discovery that tubulin
detyrosination leads to CAP-Gly protein mislocalization,
which correlates with defects in spindle positioning during
mitosis. Impaired control of spindle positioning is one factor
favoring tumor invasiveness. Thus, TCP could be a target for
developing novel therapeutic strategies against advanced
stages of cancers. Inhibitors of TCP, by reversing abnormal
detyrosinated tubulin accumulation in tumor cells, could
impair tumor progression. TCP has never been isolated
and this has hampered search of specific inhibitors. In this
article, we describe a cell-based assay of TCP activity and
its use to screen a library of natural extracts for their
inhibitory potency. This led to the isolation of two sesquiterpene lactones. We subsequently found that parthenolide, a
structurally related compound, can efficiently inhibit TCP.
This inhibitory activity is a new specific property of
parthenolide independent of its action on the nuclear
factor-KB pathway. Parthenolide is also known for its
anticancer properties. Thus, TCP inhibition could be one of
the underlying mechanisms of these anticancer properties.

Introduction
Microtubules are key components of the cytoskeleton of
eukaryotic cells. They are centrally involved in the control and
mechanics of cell division, being the principal components of
mitotic spindle. The building block of microtubules is the ahtubulin heterodimer. In most eukaryotic cells, the a chain of

tubulin can be modified by enzymatic removal of the COOHterminal tyrosine residue by an ill-defined tubulin carboxypeptidase (TCP) and by readdition of this tyrosine by a distinct enzyme,
tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL; refs. 1, 2). This tyrosination cycle is
conserved among eukaryotes (1, 3) and generates two tubulin
pools: intact tyrosinated a-tubulin (Tyr-tubulin) and detyrosinated
a-tubulin (Glu-tubulin), which lacks the COOH-terminal tyrosine.
Its physiologic importance in normal cells, tissues, or organisms
has been shown with the generation of TTL-null mice. TTL-null
mice die within hours after birth due to the disorganization of vital
neuronal circuits (4), indicating that TTL is essential for neuronal
organization.
TTL is also frequently suppressed during tumor progression (5),
with resulting accumulation of Glu-tubulin in tumor cells. TTL
suppression and resulting tubulin detyrosination in human cancers
are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness (6–8). Experiments conducted in yeast (9), in TTL nude mice (4), and in TTLnull fibroblasts (10) show that tubulin tyrosination regulates
microtubule interactions with CAP-Gly microtubule plus tiptracking proteins, such as CLIP-170. In TTL-null fibroblasts, tubulin
detyrosination and CAP-Gly protein mislocalization correlate with
defects in spindle positioning during mitosis. Because impaired
control of spindle positioning has previously been proposed as one
factor favoring tumor invasiveness (11), these results partly shed
light on the molecular basis for the apparent stimulatory effect of
Glu-tubulin accumulation on tumor progression.
Inhibition of TCP could reverse abnormal Glu-tubulin accumulation in tumor cells and could lead to the restoration of normal
Tyr-tubulin levels through tubulin synthesis (4). Such an inhibition
could thus impair tumor progression (7, 8). Until now, there are no
known specific TCP inhibitors (12). Moreover, the TCP gene has
never been identified, although biochemical TCP activity has been
reported to be present in some subcellular fractions (1, 3). Thus,
the discovery of specific TCP inhibitors could also be useful for a
ligand-based affinity purification of TCP. Finally, TCP inhibition is
also necessary for a full understanding of the tyrosination cycle.
Detyrosinated tubulin is very abundant in differentiated cells (13).
Although tubulin tyrosination is essential for microtubule interaction with some proteins plus tip-tracking proteins, it is not known
why eukaryotic cells developed a tyrosination cycle by introducing
a detyrosination reaction.
Chemogenomic strategies have proven useful to isolate chemical
compounds that could induce a specific phenotype (14, 15). In such
approaches, also referred as chemical genetics, cells are tested
against a library of small molecules using high-throughput
screening and then examined for a desired phenotype (16–18).
The subsequent identification of the intracellular protein target of

these compounds, although often technically difficult (19), has
obtained notable successes (20–23). We designed a phenotype
assay of TCP activity and used this cell-based assay to screen a
chemical library to isolate TCP inhibitors. In this report, we
describe the assay, its application to a screen of 23,904 natural
extracts, and the purification and characterization of two
sesquiterpene lactones that were able to specifically inhibit TCP.
We tested several structurally related compounds and found that
parthenolide, a known nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) inhibitor (24),
can efficiently inhibit TCP activity. Parthenolide has also been
shown to present some anticancer properties, but the underlying
mechanisms are not fully understood. TCP inhibition could be one
of the mechanisms underlying the known anticancer properties of
parthenolide.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD). They were grown in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2 and 95% air.

(National Research Centre for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany) and
Dr. J.V. Kilmartin (Medical Research Council, Cambridge, United Kingdom),

plates (reference no. 655 083; Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmuenster, Austria) in
90 AL medium. They were allowed to grow for 24 h.
Drug addition. The day following microplate preparation, each well was
robotically supplemented with 10 AL RPMI 1640 containing natural extracts
and paclitaxel so that the final concentrations were 35 Ag/mL for natural
extracts and 5 Amol/L for paclitaxel. Bioinactive controls were obtained
with paclitaxel alone (5 Amol/L). The final concentration of DMSO was
0.5%. After drugs dispense, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37jC, 5% CO2, in
the workstation incubator.
Cell immunostaining. After medium aspiration, cells were washed with
TBS/0.1% Tween 20 and fixed for 1 h with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were
permeabilized with 100 AL methanol for 5 min.
After two washes with 300 AL of TBS/0.03% Tween 20 [10 mmol/L TrisHCl, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 0.03% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.4)], cells were
coincubated for 1.5 h at 37jC with Glu-tubulin and HRP-conjugated
antibodies diluted, respectively, at 1:10,000 and 1:5,000. Cells were rinsed
twice and then incubated for 10 min with SuperSignal ELISA
Pico chemiluminescent substrate. Luminescence was measured using a
BMG FLUOstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg,
Germany).
Result analysis. Raw data were exported from the software of the
microplate reader to an Excel file and normalized according to the
following procedure. Mean values of DMSO and paclitaxel were calculated
for each individual microplate using intraplate control data points.
Paclitaxel and DMSO mean values were considered as bioinactive control
(0% inhibition) and bioactive control (100% inhibition) of TCP activity,
respectively.
Assay performance. To evaluate the quality of the assay, the Z¶ factor
was calculated using the following equation according to Zhang et al. (26):
Z0 ¼ 1 

ð3cþ þ 3c Þ
jcþ  c j

where c+ is the bioactive controls, c is the bioinactive controls, l is the
mean, and r is the SD.
In our experimental conditions, the Z¶ was comprised between 0.54 and
0.57, indicating that the assay is of good quality for high-throughput
screening.

Sample Collection and Extract Preparation
Plant samples were collected worldwide under the general framework
of the International Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro,
Argentina, 1992). Bases for the collection were the taxonomic
identification of the species, botanical diversity, and availability for a
second collection. No rare or protected plants belonged to the collection.
When possible, the different organs of the plants were separated and
treated as different samples (bark, leaves, root, etc.). Each plant sample
was dried (55jC) and finely ground. An aliquot of the plant (20 g) was
macerated overnight in 200 mL ethyl acetate in an Erlenmeyer flask;
after filtration, the solvent was evaporated in vacuo to give the ethyl
acetate crude extract. Part of the extract (50 mg) was adsorbed on 500
mg Sigel, which was placed on top of SiO2 solid-phase extraction
cartridge. Successive elutions with CHCl3, CHCl3/MeOH (17:3), and MeOH
provided three ‘‘fractions,’’ which were conditioned in 96-well deep-well
plates for the screening after evaporation of the solvents and replacement
with 1 mL DMSO, along with the ‘‘crude extract’’ at a concentration of
50 mg/mL.

Bioassay-Guided Fractionation of the Extract from Vernonia
perrottetii
Finely ground aerial parts from the plant (97 g) were macerated
overnight in 1 L ethyl acetate; the suspension was filtered and the organic
filtrate was evaporated in vacuum to give 9.6 g of a gum. Part of this extract
(4 g) was dissolved in 8 mL chloroform and adsorbed on a Sigel column
(120 g) eluted in 200 mL fractions under 18 p.s.i. at a 30 mL/min flow rate with
a chloroform/methanol gradient (10 min: CHCl3; 50 min: CHCl3/MeOH (17:3);
10 min: MeOH). The second fraction concentrated the activity and was
further purified on a semiprep high-performance liquid chromatography

primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies. Antibodies were
diluted in PBS/0.1% BSA. YL1/2 and L4 antibodies were used at a 1:4,000
dilution. Cy3-conjugated antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 and 1:500 dilution, respectively. Nuclei
were stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 Ag/mL).
Coverslips were mounted in FluorSave and observed using a Zeiss
Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Microinjection
Cells grown on glass coverslips were injected using a 5171 micromanipulator and a 5246 transjector (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GmbH, Hamburg,
Germany).
ID3 antibody used in microinjection experiments was diluted at
a concentration of 4 mg/mL in PBS buffer. Before microinjection, the
solution was clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor
(100,000  g, 4jC, 10 min). The supernatant was then loaded into injection
needles and injected into HeLa cells. After microinjection, cells were
incubated for 4 h. They were then processed for immunofluorescence as
described above.

Assay of CPA Activity on Permeabilized Cells
Cells grown for 2 days on glass coverslips were permeabilized with warm
OPT buffer [80 mmol/L PIPES, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5%
Triton X-100, 10% glycerol (pH 6.8)]. OPT buffer permeabilizes cells while
preserving intact microtubules (28). CPA (0.5 Ag/mL) diluted in warm OPT
buffer was added with or without inhibitory compounds (1 mmol/L). Cells
were incubated for 15 min at 37jC and then fixed and processed for
immunofluorescence as described above.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the different steps of the cell-based assay of
TCP activity used for high-throughput screening of TCP inhibitors. TCP activity on
paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules is measured by quantifying the production of
detyrosinated tubulin using a specific antibody and an immunoluminescence
procedure as described in Materials and Methods. The inhibitory effect of active
natural extracts is detected by a decrease of the luminescent signal.

Lichrospher column with a water/acetonitrile gradient. Compound V18 was
eluted at 15.6 min and compound V19 was eluted at 16.6 min (gradient
system: water/acetonitrile, from 6/4 to 1/19 in 20 min).

Description of the Molecules
V18: crystals from diethyl ether (melting point 136jC), MS, UV, IR, and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra identical with those published
in the literature (27); V19: amorphous gum with MS, UV, IR, and NMR
spectra identical with those published in the literature.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Some of the natural extract fractions were tested for their cytotoxic
activity. This cytotoxic activity was estimated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation/cytotoxicity
assay. This assay is a colorimetric assay, which measures the reduction of a
tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the
mitochondria of viable cells. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well flatbottomed microplates at a density of 30,000 per well. Twenty-four hours
after plating, the fractions were added and appropriately diluted in DMSO.
After 2 h of incubation with the fractions, the medium was replaced with
MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL in
serum-free, phenol red–free RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies). The cells were
then let to incubate for 3 h to develop purple formazan precipitate. The
MTT formazan was then solubilized in DMSO, and the absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm.

Immunofluorescence Procedure
Cells grown for 2 days on glass coverslips were washed with warm PBS
and fixed for 6 min in anhydrous methanol at 20jC. After an additional
wash in PBS/0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, cells were sequentially incubated with

were then fixed, double stained with Tyr-tubulin and Glu-tubulin antibodies as
indicated, and processed for immunofluorescence as described in Materials and
Methods.

Figure 3. Analysis of the effect of natural extract fractions on TCP activity
revealed by accumulation of Glu-tubulin after ID3 microinjection. HeLa cells
were microinjected with the TTL inhibitory antibody ID3, incubated for 4 h
with (A) or without (B ) a TCP-inhibiting fraction, fixed, and processed for
immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods. Cells were triple
stained using an antimouse Cy3-conjugated antibody to mark ID3 microinjected
cells, L4 antibody and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody to
visualize Glu-tubulin, and Hoechst 33258 to visualize nuclei. In control cells (A),
Glu-tubulin is generated in the microinjected cells and not in a nonmicroinjected
cell (arrow ), which can be localized thanks to Hoechst 33258 staining.

presence of such a fraction, the level of Glu-tubulin is as low in microinjected
cells as in nonmicroinjected cells (arrows ).

immunoluminescence using a specific antibody (6, 28). The Glutubulin signal obtained after treatment of the cells with paclitaxel
alone was defined as 0% of inhibition, whereas the basal Glutubulin signal obtained after treatment with only DMSO was taken
as 100% of inhibition. The different steps of the assay are illustrated
in Fig. 1.
Screening of partially purified natural extracts. A total of
23,904 partially purified extracts, corresponding to 3,252 natural
species (81.5% plants, 2.5% insects, and 16% marine organisms),
was screened for potential TCP-inhibiting activity using the above
described assay (Fig. 1). Among these, 268 extracts (1.1% hit rate)
were scored as positive, showing >50% of inhibition. However, in
such a cell-based assay, a lowered Glu-tubulin signal could result
from a global toxic effect of the extracts on the cells. We thus
assayed the extract cytotoxicity using a MTT assay. A subset of
127 extracts showed some cytotoxicity after 2 h of incubation on
the cells and was discarded. Among the 141 remaining extracts,
49 extracts showed an apparent inhibitory activity superior to
70%. These most active extracts were set aside for further
characterization.
Bioguided fractionation and identification of TCP inhibitors. The 49 extracts were submitted to fractionation by
combining chromatographies (normal and reverse C18 phases),
and each fraction was tested again using several different biological
complementary assays (bioguided fractionation). The aim of these
other assays was to discriminate between false- and true-positive
compounds.

Results
Screen for chemicals that decrease paclitaxel-induced
tubulin detyrosination. The rationale of the assay relies on the
substrate properties of TCP and TTL. TTL, the enzyme that
catalyzes the tubulin tyrosination reaction, adds tyrosine to soluble,
detyrosinated tubulin and does not react with tubulin once it is
assembled into microtubules (3, 29–31). TCP is likely to prefer
polymerized substrate, and its binding to microtubules may be
required for its function (30, 32, 33). TCP acts slowly on
microtubules, whereas TTL recharges Glu-tubulin quickly on
release from microtubules (30). As a consequence of the substrate
specificity of TTL and of the kinetic differences of TTL and TCP,
Tyr-tubulin is the main component of dynamic microtubules, being
the dominant tubulin variant in cycling cells in vitro, whereas Glutubulin is a marker of long-lived stable microtubules (3, 30, 34–36).
Depending on the cell type, these Glu-microtubules either are not
detectable or represent a small subpopulation of the cellular
microtubules. In HeLa cells, these Glu-microtubules are almost
absent (28). However, they do accumulate on paclitaxel treatment,
indicating that TCP is active in these cells. We set up an assay
amenable to automation, in which TCP inhibitors were selected
according to their ability to inhibit accumulation of Glu-tubulin in
HeLa cells with paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules. Briefly, compounds were added to HeLa cells grown in 96-well microplates.
Cells were treated with paclitaxel immediately after addition of the
compounds. After 2 h of incubation, cells were rinsed, fixed, and
permeabilized with methanol. Glu-tubulin was then quantified by

Figure 5. Comparison of the effect of
several structural analogues of V18 and
V19 on TCP activity evaluated after
ID3 microinjection. HeLa cells were
microinjected with the TTL inhibitory
antibody ID3 and incubated for 4 h with
the different compounds as indicated.
They were then fixed and processed for
immunofluorescence as described in
Materials and Methods. Cells were
triple stained using an antimouse
Cy3-conjugated antibody to mark ID3
microinjected cells, L4 antibody and Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody
to visualize Glu-tubulin, and Hoechst
33258 to visualize nuclei as indicated.

All fractions were first screened using tubulin immunofluorescence microscopy to examine their effects on microtubule
structure (data not shown). Fractions able to depolymerize the
microtubule network were classed as potential false positive.
Indeed, such compounds could have competed with paclitaxel
during the high-throughput screening assay and thus led to a
diminished Glu-tubulin signal that does not result to TCP
inhibition. Such depolymerizing fractions were discarded, and
only fractions showing no detectable effect on the microtubule
network were kept. These last fractions were checked for their
inhibitory effect on paclitaxel-induced tubulin detyrosination using
tubulin immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). When cells were
only treated with DMSO (Fig. 2A), the Glu-microtubules represented a small subpopulation of cellular microtubules as expected.
After paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 2B), Glu-microtubules did accumulate, reflecting TCP action on stabilized microtubules. This
accumulation was prevented when cells were treated with the
fractions selected by the screening strategy, together with
paclitaxel (Fig. 2C), although paclitaxel still exerted its stabilizing
effect as indicated by the presence of tyrosinated microtubule
bundles.
Finally, the inhibitory effect of the remaining fractions was
investigated with another assay of TCP activity using microinjection experiments (Fig. 3). In such an assay, TCP activity is assessed
after blocking TTL activity in cells by microinjection of ID3,
a monoclonal antibody directed against the active site of TTL
(29, 37). The activity of TCP is revealed in injected cells by the
resulting accumulation of Glu-tubulin (Fig. 3A). In the presence of a
TCP-inhibiting fraction, such an accumulation does not occur. In
that case, the level of detyrosinated tubulin (Fig. 3B) is as low in
microinjected cells as in non-microinjected cells, which can be
localized thanks to Hoechst 33258 staining of the nuclei.

The overall process allowed the selection of an extract from
Vernonia perrottetii, and this led to the isolation of two compounds
(V18 and V19). Their structures were established by analysis of
their NMR data and comparison with published values. These
compounds were structurally related sesquiterpene lactones (V18
and V19; Fig. 4). They showed a potent TCP inhibitory activity, as
assessed by ID3 microinjection experiment, for a concentration of
10 Amol/L.
Preliminary structure-activity relationships. We tested the
effect of 17 available structural analogues of the active compounds
(Fig. 4), at a final concentration of 20 Amol/L, on TCP activity
evaluated by ID3 microinjection experiments. Among these
compounds, we found that only the known anti-inflammatory
sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, originally extracted from
feverfew Tanacetum parthenium, and, to a much lesser extent,
cnicin displayed a TCP inhibitory activity (Fig. 5D).
Parthenolide showed a similar TCP inhibitory activity than the
two compounds isolated from V. perrottetii (Fig. 5A). This indicates
that the C8 lateral chain, present on V18 and V19, is not necessary
for TCP inhibitory activity.
There are strong indications that alkylation of cysteine(s) is a
general mechanism for sesquiterpene lactones, which possess a,hunsaturated carbonyl structures, such as a-methylene lactones
(24). These structural elements preferably react with nucleophiles,
especially sulfhydryl groups, by a Michael-type addition. To test the
importance of such an unsaturated a, h-lactone, we synthesized
dihydroparthenolide and assayed it for TCP inhibition. Dihydroparthenolide did not show any activity (Fig. 5B), indicating that the
unsaturated a, h-lactone is in fact necessary for TCP inhibitory
activity. However, we found that the presence of the unsaturated a,
h-lactone, even if it is necessary, is not sufficient for TCP inhibition.
For instance, costunolide showed no TCP inhibitory activity

(Fig. 5C). Costunolide possesses an unsaturated a, h-lactone and
differs from parthenolide by the lost of an epoxide function. This
underlies the importance of the epoxide function in TCP inhibitory
activity. The replacement of this epoxide function by an alcohol
(cnicin) leads to a partial loss of activity (Fig. 5D).
We tested the cytotoxicity of parthenolide and of the compounds
V18 and V19. HeLa cells were exposed to increasing concentrations
of these molecules, and cytotoxicity was measured after 48 h using
MTT assay. We found that parthenolide, V18, and V19 had similar
cytotoxic properties with an IC50 of 8, 3.5, and 7.1 Amol/L,
respectively.
Does the observed parthenolide inhibition of TCP activity
result from NF-KB inhibition? One well-described activity of
parthenolide is its potent anti-inflammatory effect, which is mainly
achieved through its inhibitory effects on NF-nB activation. Thus,
the observed TCP inhibition by parthenolide could actually be an
indirect result of NF-nB inhibition. Costunolide, an also known NFnB inhibitor, has no effect on TCP activity, indicating that TCP
inhibition does not result from NF-nB inhibition. However, this
conclusion remains uncertain due to the different NF-nB inhibitory
potencies of parthenolide and costunolide (24). To get insight into
that question, we tested the effect of sulindac, an inhibitor of
NF-nB activation (38, 39) that is not structurally related to
parthenolide or costunolide, on TCP activity. We found that
1 mmol/L sulindac has no inhibitory effect on the generation of
Glu-tubulin induced by ID3 microinjection (data not shown). This
result strongly shows that parthenolide inhibition of TCP activity is
independent of NF-nB inhibition.
Specific action of parthenolide on TCP. In vitro, CPA is able to
excise the COOH-terminal tyrosine of tubulin as well as does TCP
in cells (40). We tested if parthenolide could also inhibit CPA using
a cell-based assay of CPA activity. In such an assay, the effect of the
application of exogenous CPA on the cellular microtubule network
is observed by the generation of Glu-tubulin in permeabilized cells.
The buffer used for the permeabilization preserves microtubule
network (28). In the absence of CPA, the microtubule network is
predominantly composed of Tyr-tubulin, whereas Glu-tubulin is
almost absent (Fig. 6A).
After an exposition of 15 min to CPA, the Glu-tubulin staining
is largely enhanced, extending to the entire microtubule network
(Fig. 6B). This augmentation is prevented when orthophenanthroline is added to cells in combination with CPA (Fig. 6C).
Orthophenanthroline is a known CPA inhibitor with no effect on
TCP (12). When cells are exposed with CPA in combination with
parthenolide, the Glu-tubulin staining is the same as the Glutubulin staining observed with CPA alone (Fig. 6D). Although
parthenolide is a reactive compound because of its unsaturated a,
h-lactone, this result shows that it has no effect on CPA even at the
highest concentration (1 mmol/L) tested.

Discussion
By screening a natural extract library on a cell-based assay of
TCP activity, we have isolated two structurally related sesquiterpene lactones that produce a strong inhibition on cellular TCP
activity.
When searching for therapeutic agents, cell-based assays are
particularly valuable because they select not only for activity
against a particular molecular target but also for other desirable
properties, such as the ability to permeate cells and to retain
activity in tissue culture medium and in cells (23). Moreover, by

Figure 6. Test of the effect of parthenolide on CPA. Permeabilized cells were
exposed to buffer alone (A) or to CPA (B–D ) alone (B) or in combination with
orthophenanthroline (C ) or with parthenolide (D ) as described in Materials and
Methods. After 15 min of exposition, cells were fixed and processed for
immunofluorescence. Cells were double stained with Tyr-tubulin antibody and
Glu-tubulin antibody as indicated.

screening for inhibitors on the entire cell, multiple potential
targets, direct or indirect, are tested, allowing the cell to dictate the
best target.
Although the screen that we set up could lead to the selection of
some false positives, the overall strategy was discriminative and led
to the isolation of only two compounds. This is noteworthy as
regards the high number of compounds tested. We have screened
extracts, which could be considered as mixtures of natural substances. Thus, the true number of different compounds tested is
much higher than 23,904 (i.e., the number of extracts tested).
We tested several commercially available analogues of the
compounds that were isolated by the screening procedure and
found that parthenolide, but not the closely related compound
costunolide, has also a potent inhibitory effect on TCP. Parthenolide, as well as other sesquiterpene lactones, contains an
a-methylene-h-lactone moiety, which is highly reactive with
cellular thiols, resulting in alkylation of sulfydryl residues through
Michael-type addition. We found that this a-methylene-h-lactone
moiety was indispensable for the inhibitory effect of parthenolide
on TCP. If the observed inhibitory effect of parthenolide is the
consequence of a direct reaction of parthenolide with TCP, this
result indicates that TCP could belong to the class of cysteine
proteases. Moreover, as parthenolide has no effect on CPA and as

known metalloproteinases inhibitors have no effect on TCP (12), it
seems that TCP is not a metalloproteinase.
Numerous bioactivities, probably as a consequence of its high
reactivity, have been described for parthenolide and other related
sesquiterpene lactones. These bioactivities include, for example,
anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of NF-nB activation
(41) and signal transducers and activators of transcription
signaling pathway (42) or induction of apoptosis through several
different mechanisms, such as caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction (43, 44). Contrary to the panel of actions
described for sesquiterpene lactones, TCP inhibition looks to be
a specific action of parthenolide and of the two Vernonia
compounds selected.
We have shown that the inhibitory effect of parthenolide on TCP
does not seem to result from the parthenolide action on NF-nB
pathway. However, we cannot exclude that TCP inhibition is an
indirect consequence of an action of parthenolide on another
known or unknown target. For example, it cannot be excluded that
parthenolide inhibits regulating enzymes, such as kinases or
phosphatases. It has been shown that inhibitors of serine/
threonine phosphatases seem to dissociate TCP from microtubules
(45). Such an inhibition could thus represent an indirect form of
TCP inhibition.
Our initial aim was to use the inhibitor selected by the screening
procedure as a hook, in an attempt to isolate TCP, as it has been

successfully done in some chemical genetic approaches. However,
because of its high reactivity and its numerous targets, parthenolide is no suitable for such a strategy. We are currently testing other
chemical libraries in an attempt to isolate a compound more
convenient for TCP purification.
The anticancer potential of parthenolide has been described
both in vitro (43, 46–49) and on animal models (44, 50). Moreover,
it has been shown that parthenolide could reduce metastasis (50).
We believe that TCP inhibition, which could antagonize the
abnormal accumulation of detyrosinated tubulin in tumor cells,
could be one of the mechanisms underlying the anticancer and
antimetastatic properties of parthenolide. Because parthenolide
has shown safety in phase I clinical trials, our results have direct
clinical relevance.
