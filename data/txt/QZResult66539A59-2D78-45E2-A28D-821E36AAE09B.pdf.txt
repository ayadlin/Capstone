and

macrocytosis have been described in patients treated with these agents.

METHODS. A retrospective review of all patients with metastatic RCC who were
treated with sunitinib or sorafenib for at least 3 months at the Cleveland Clinic
Taussig Cancer Institute was undertaken. Complete blood count (CBC) data
including red blood cell indices were recorded at baseline, after 3 months of therapy, and at the end of treatment.

RESULTS. A total of 61 patients were treated with sunitinib and 37 patients were
treated with sorafenib with available CBC data. In patients treated with sunitinib,
the median corpuscular volume (MCV) increased significantly at 3 months com-

pared with baseline (median increase of 5.1 femtoliters [fL]; P < .001) and continued to increase throughout treatment. Patients who developed hypothyroidism
had a larger MCV increase at 3 months than patients who remained euthyroid (P
5 .06), although macrocytosis was observed in patients without hypothyroidism.
Ten patients discontinued sunitinib therapy, and the MCV decreased in all
patients within 2 to 4 months, without further intervention. Bone marrow analysis of 4 patients revealed a hypocellular bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of metastasis. There was no evidence of folate or vitamin
B12 deficiency. In contrast to sunitinib, there was no change in the MCV for
patients treated with sorafenib.

CONCLUSIONS. Macrocytosis was a common occurrence after treatment with
sunitinib but not sorafenib in patients with metastatic RCC. Sunitinib-induced
macrocytosis is reversible with drug discontinuation. Cancer 2008;113:1309–14.

he underlying biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) supports
the importance of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
pathway in tumor pathogenesis.1 As such, several therapeutic agents
targeted against various aspects of the VEGF pathway have demonstrated robust clinical effects, largely supplanting cytokine therapy
as a standard of care for advanced RCC. Sunitinib and sorafenib are
small molecule inhibitors of a family of receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors including the VEGF receptor.2,3 The hematologic toxicities
of these agents have been reported, including neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.4,5 Macrocytosis, defined as
an increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the red blood
cells (RBCs), has also been noted with sunitinib therapy.6,7 Based on
these observations, a comprehensive review of the hematologic and

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The medical records of patients with metastatic RCC
who were treated with sunitinib or sorafenib and
who were enrolled onto institutional review boardapproved clinical trials at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute between October 2003 and January 2006 were reviewed. Sunitinib was administered
at a dose of 50 mg orally daily for the first 4 weeks of
a 6-week cycle. Sorafenib was administered orally
twice daily at a dose of 400 mg. Dose interruptions
and/or reductions were permitted for toxicity and
undertaken according to the guidelines for each individual study. Eligibility criteria for the trials were
fairly uniform and generally included the following:
histologic documentation of clear cell RCC; clinical
or biopsy evidence of metastatic disease; measurable
disease; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; adequate renal,
hepatic, and bone marrow function; absent or previously treated central nervous system metastasis; no
prior history of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma
or carcinoma in situ of the cervix); the absence of
significant cardiac disease; and no recent surgery.
Patients not receiving at least 3 months of treatment
because of toxicity, death, or disease progression
were excluded from the analysis.
Patient characteristics (including age and sex),
complete blood count (CBC) indices (hemoglobin [in
g/dL], white blood cell and neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and MCV), and thyroid function tests
(TFT) were recorded at baseline (within 2 weeks of
the initiation of starting therapy), at 3 months, and
at the end of therapy.

Statistical Analysis
Data were summarized descriptively as frequency
counts, medians, and ranges. Both absolute and
relative changes in the hematologic parameters after
3 months of treatment and at the end of treatment
were analyzed; however, the results were found to be
similar and therefore only the absolute changes are
reported here. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was
used to assess these changes within each treatment
group. The Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank
sum test were used to compare the 2 groups with
respect to patient characteristics and baseline hematologic parameters. All statistical tests were 2-sided
and a P value <.05 was considered statistically signif-

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 119 patients with metastatic RCC who were
treated with either sunitinib or sorafenib were initially considered for inclusion in the current study. After excluding 21 patients because they did not
receive at least 3 months of treatment due to disease
progression or discontinuation of therapy due to
toxicity, hematologic and patient data from
61 patients who were treated with sunitinib and
37 patients who were treated with sorafenib were
available for analysis. The study population was typical of RCC patients entered onto clinical trials (Table
1). Consistent with previous reports,8,9 the majority
of sunitinib-treated patients and some sorafenibtreated patents developed hypothyroidism (as
defined by 1 TFT biochemical abnormalities consistent with hypothyroidism occurring at some point
during therapy). Patients treated with sorafenib were
somewhat older than the patients treated with sunitinib (median age of 64 years vs 59 years, respectively;
P 5 .03); however, the distributions of sex and pretreatment hematologic parameters were found to be
similar (P > .15 in all cases).
Change in MCV and Other Hematologic Parameters
Among patients treated with sunitinib, the MCV
increased significantly at 3 months compared with
baseline (Table 2 (median increase of 5.1 femtoliters
[fL]; P < .001). A total of 41 patients (67%) had an
MCV >100 fL at some point after the initiation of
sunitinib therapy. In addition, platelet and WBC
counts decreased significantly, whereas hemoglobin
remained fairly stable. Similar patterns of change
were noted when comparing patients who received
less than compared with those who received greater

than 12 months of therapy (data not shown). Figure 1
depicts a representative peripheral blood smear of a
sunitinib-treated patient who developed macrocytosis.
Because of the retrospective nature of this review, serum studies to rule out other causes of macrocytosis
were only able to be drawn on a subset of patients
who were still receiving therapy of variable duration at
the time of analysis. The median serum vitamin B12
level was 422 pg/mL (12 patients; range, 220 pg/mL1249 pg/mL [laboratory normal range, 221 pg/mL700 pg/mL]) and the median serum folate level was
15.4 ng/mL (10 patients; range, 10.4 ng/mL->18 ng/
mL [laboratory normal range, 2.8 ng/mL-18 ng/mL]).
Available data indicated a normal reticulocyte count in
the subset of patients for whom data were available
and suggests that compensatory reticulocytosis in
response to drug-induced anemia is an unlikely cause
for macrocytosis. Similarly, spurious macrocytosis was
unlikely because of the absence of RBC agglutination
in several of the peripheral blood smears available.

Bone marrow analysis of 4 patients who had an MCV
increase while receiving sunitinib demonstrated a
hypocellular bone marrow (<5% [2 patients], 10%, and
10%-20%) with trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of metastasis. One of these patients had undergone a bone marrow examination 5 years prior for
unexplained neutropenia, with normal morphology
and 30% cellularity reported (Figs. 2a and 2b). In addition, in all patients there was normoblastic maturation
of erythroid precursors and no evidence of hypersegmented neutrophils.
In patients who received sunitinib for 12
months (18 patients), the MCV continued to increase
throughout treatment. Ten patients in whom the
MCV increased during sunitinib treatment had laboratory data available approximately 2 months to
3 months after sunitinib was discontinued. Among
these patients, the MCV values tended to decrease
relative to their final on-treatment assessment (median decrease of 9.7 fL; P 5 .002), hemoglobin tended

to remain stable (median decrease of 0.1 g/dL; P 5
.56), and the platelet and WBC counts tended to
increase (median increases of 30.5 K/lL [P 5 .06] and
1.9 K/lL [P 5 .01], respectively). These patients did
not receive subsequent treatment at the time of laboratory assessment while not receiving sunitinib.
There was no correlation reported between the development of hypothyroidism and pretreatment MCV,
hemoglobin, platelet counts, or WBC counts. Patients
who were euthyroid tended to have smaller increases
in the MCV at 3 months compared with patients who
developed hypothyroidism (median increase of 3.9 fL
vs 6.2 fL, respectively; P 5 .03). A total of 28 patients
(46%) who received sunitinib developed hypothyroidism (as defined by 1 TFT biochemical abnormalities
consistent with hypothyroidism noted at some point
during therapy). Twenty-one patients (51%) who developed macrocytosis (MCV >100 fL) also developed
hypothyroidism. There was no association noted
between other specific hematologic toxicities and other
toxicities with sunitinib and no association between
MCV changes and clinical outcomes such as objective
response or time to disease progression was observed.
As with sunitinib, the WBC count decreased after
3 months of therapy with sorafenib (P 5 .04) (Table
3). However, in contrast to sunitinib, there was no
change in MCV noted (P 5 .30), hemoglobin
increased (P 5 .02), and the platelet count remained
fairly stable (P 5 .62).

DISCUSSION
Sunitinib and sorafenib are targeted anticancer agents
that are in common use in metastatic RCC and currently are being investigated in a wide variety of malig-

nancies. This retrospective review describes the
hematologic effects of sunitinib and sorafenib in metastatic RCC patients treated for at least 3 months. The
MCV of RBCs increased throughout sunitinib therapy
and was associated with a nonsignificant decline in
hemoglobin levels. Although the MCV increase was
greater in those patients who developed biochemical
hypothyroidism, macrocytosis was not restricted to
this subset. Furthermore, no alternative etiology of
macrocytosis, including alternative drugs or vitamin
B12/folate deficiency, was identified and sunitinibinduced macrocytosis was found to be reversible with
drug discontinuation. These observations support
sunitinib as a cause of drug-induced macrocytosis.
Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV of > than
100 fL. Macrocytosis has been reported in 2% to 4% of
unselected patients, with the most common causes

being therapeutic agents, alcoholism, liver disease,
hypothyroidism, and the megaloblastic anemias including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.10 RBCs enter
the circulation from the bone marrow as reticulocytes,
which are macrocytic with an MCV ranging from
100 fL to 125 fL until remodeling leads to reductions in
the cell water content and membrane. Macrocytic anemia is divided into 2 categories: megaloblastic and
nonmegaloblastic. Nonmegaloblastic causes of normoblastic macrocytosis are alcoholism, liver disease,
hypothyroidism, primary bone marrow disorders, and
certain drugs, most notably zidovudine, azathioprine,
methotrexate, and capecitabine. None of these alternative etiologies were identified in the current study
cohort. Excessive reticulocytes in the peripheral blood
from a variety of causes including anemia can also
lead to an overall increase in MCV. Although hemoglobin levels in the sunitinib-treated cohort decreased
over the duration of treatment, this decline was nonsignificant and there was no evidence of reticulocytosis

leading to the MCV increase observed. Megaloblastic
anemia results from defective DNA synthesis leading to
ineffective or dysplastic erythropoiesis, most commonly
from vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Although data
were not available for the entire cohort, no evidence of
nutritional deficiency was identified in any of the
patients assayed. Furthermore, the decline in the MCV
to normal levels when patients were withdrawn from
sunitinib therapy argues against an alternative underlying etiology.
The results of the current study are in contrast
to recent reports of sunitinib-induced macrocytosis,
which implicated vitamin B12 deficiency in the etiology of macrocytosis.6,7 These studies also observed
similar degrees of macrocytosis, but were limited by
smaller sample sizes and their retrospective nature.
One of the studies noted that vitamin B12 deficiency
preceded macrocytosis and persisted after vitamin
B12 replacement therapy, thus implicating additional
or alternative mechanisms to sunitinib-induced mac-

rocytosis.6 An additional recent preliminary report of
RCC patients receiving sunitinib supports the observations made in the current study cohort, with a 48%
incidence of macrocytosis and a lack of identifiable
alternative etiologies.11
The current study is limited by the retrospective
nature of the review. Although all patients who
received sunitinib or sorafenib for at least 3 months
were included, we were unable to undertake any prospective examination to more thoroughly investigate
additional etiologic factors that might contribute to
macrocytosis. Similarly, the measurement of serum
factors such as vitamin B12 and folate was undertaken
in only a subset of patients. However, to our knowledge, the current study represents the largest number
of sunitinib-treated RCC patients with a comprehensive blood count analysis presented to date.
Although the mechanism of sunitinib-induced
macrocytosis is not clear, data from a report of imatinib treatment in patients with gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GISTs) may provide insight.12 GISTs prominently exhibit gain-of-function mutations in the stem
cell factor receptor (c-KIT) gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the c-KIT protein and its downstream
signals. Imatinib is a small molecule that has antitumor effect in GISTs through inhibition of c-KIT. Macrocytosis was noted in 42% of GIST patients receiving
imatinib with no other etiologies identified. The common mechanism for imatinib and sunitinib that may
lead to macrocytosis is c-KIT inhibition.2 It is interesting to note that sorafenib has much weaker inhibitory
activity against c-kit, and macrocytosis was not
observed with sorafenib treatment in this cohort.3 In
support of the hypothesis that sunitinib could cause
macrocytic anemia through inhibition of c-kit, the
bone marrow of the patients treated with sunitinib
was found to be hypocellular, with decreased trilineage
hematopoiesis, indicating a possibly low proliferation
rate in the stem cell compartment. The precise
mechanisms of c-kit–mediated macrocytosis requires
further investigation.
In conclusion, sunitinib treatment leads to RBC
macrocytosis in patients with metastatic RCC. The correlation between macrocytosis and the development of
anemia and hypothyroidism, and levels of nutritional
factors such as vitamin B12 and folate have not been
fully elucidated, but data presented in the current
study indicate sunitinib as a direct cause of macrocytosis. The mechanism by which sunitinib leads to
increases in RBC volume may be mediated by c-kit inhibition. The return of the MCV to normal after the
discontinuation of sunitinib without other intervention

supports the idea that this phenomenon is temporary
and reversible. The occurrence of macrocytosis with
sunitinib treatment does not preclude the continuation of treatment and does not appear to impact clinical efficacy or toxicity. However, this phenomenon
may compromise blinding in placebo-controlled sunitinib studies and could subsequently lead to unintended bias in the treatment or interpretation of
clinical outcomes such as objective response. Routine
monitoring of CBC and RBC indices during sunitinib
therapy is warranted, and sunitinib should be considered as a possible cause for otherwise unexplained
macrocytosis.
