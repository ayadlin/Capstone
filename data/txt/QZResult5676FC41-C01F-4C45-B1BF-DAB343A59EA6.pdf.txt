Abstract
The histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 are involved in recurrent leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations and are key
regulators of cell growth. Therefore, efforts to generate inhibitors of
CBP/p300 are of clinical value. We developed a speciﬁc and potent
acetyl-lysine competitive protein–protein interaction inhibitor, ICBP112, that targets the CBP/p300 bromodomains. Exposure of
human and mouse leukemic cell lines to I-CBP112 resulted in
substantially impaired colony formation and induced cellular
differentiation without signiﬁcant cytotoxicity. I-CBP112 signiﬁcantly reduced the leukemia-initiating potential of MLL-AF9þ

acute myeloid leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro
and in vivo. Interestingly, I-CBP112 increased the cytotoxic activity
of BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 as well as doxorubicin.
Collectively, we report the development and preclinical evaluation
of a novel, potent inhibitor targeting CBP/p300 bromodomains
that impairs aberrant self-renewal of leukemic cells. The synergistic
effects of I-CBP112 and current standard therapy (doxorubicin) as
well as emerging treatment strategies (BET inhibition) provide
new opportunities for combinatorial treatment of leukemia and
potentially other cancers. Cancer Res; 75(23); 5106–19. 2015 AACR.

The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP; CREBBP) and p300 (adenovirus E1A-associated 300-kD protein) are two closely related and evolutionary
conserved histone acetyl transferases (HAT; ref. 1). CBP/p300
function as transcriptional regulators by acetylating histone
tails and other nuclear proteins. They also act as scaffolds
recruiting transcription factors to transcriptional active loci
through a large diversity of protein interaction domains. The
HAT activity of CBP is regulated by autoacetylation of a basic
surface loop region that competes with substrate binding and
by the presence of a RING domain located adjacent to the
catalytic HAT domain (2). Interestingly, CBP/p300-mediated
acetylation creates binding sites for the acetyl-lysine–speciﬁc
CBP/p300 bromodomain, which is required for proper substrate targeting, resulting in a positive feedback loop and
maintenance of CBP/p300 enzymatic activity (2).
Homozygous loss of either Cbp or p300 leads to embryonic
lethality in utero in mice due to developmental defects including
impaired hematopoiesis (3, 4). Studies in heterozygous mice have
characterized Cbp as an essential regulator of hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) self-renewal. Likewise, conditional ablation of Cbp in
adult mice altered differentiation, quiescence, apoptosis, and selfrenewal of adult HSCs (5).
CBP/p300 has been functionally linked to the development of
multiple human cancers, including solid tumors and hematologic

Selective Inhibitor for CBP/p300 Bromodomains

malignancies (6). CBP/p300 has been detected in several
oncogenic fusions in leukemia involving either the MOZ acetyltransferase or the mixed linage leukemia (MLL) gene product
promoting cell proliferation (7, 8). The most prevalent is the
chromosomal translocation t(11;16)(q23;p13) associated with
mostly therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes resulting in a fusion protein that contains
the bromodomains of CBP and parts of MLL (8, 9). CBP/p300 was
also proposed to act as transcriptional coactivator of other leukemogenic proteins such as the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion (10).
Recently, it has been shown that p300 interacts with the AML1ETO fusion protein, present in over 20% of human AML, and that
it regulates transcription of multiple AML1–ETO target genes
including Id1 (inhibitor of DNA binding 1), the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 and Egr1 (early growth response 1) that are drivers of selfrenewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (11). Furthermore, inhibition of p300 abrogates acetylation of AML1-ETO
and impaired clonogenic growth in vitro and leukemic transformation in vivo (12).
The multidomain organization of CBP/p300 has prompted
several inhibitor development projects. The HAT activity has been
targeted by natural compounds that mostly lacked speciﬁcity
(13). The most potent HAT inhibitor developed so far is C646,
which has low micromolar activity (14). C646 inhibits growth of
tumor cell lines and promotes cellular senescence and reduced
colony formation of AML1-ETO–positive AML cell lines and
primary blasts isolated from leukemic mice and AML patients
(15). In addition, "ischemin" and a number of nonspeciﬁc fragments with micromolar potency have been reported to target the
CBP bromodomain (16, 17).
Here, we report a selective and highly potent chemical probe
compound targeting the bromodomains of CBP/p300. Bromodomains are protein interaction domains with predicted good
druggability (18), which has been demonstrated by potent and
selective inhibitors developed for the BET (bromo and extracellular domain) family of transcriptional regulators (19–22). We
developed the acetyl-lysine mimetic oxazepine inhibitor ICBP112 that binds to CBP/p300 with nanomolar afﬁnity and
good selectivity. In leukemia, we found that I-CBP112 impaired
the disease-initiating self-renewal leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo
without causing signiﬁcant cytotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
Protein puriﬁcation
cDNA encoding human bromodomains were cloned, expressed,
and puriﬁed as previously described (19). For puriﬁcation of in vivo
biotinylated protein expression, the same construct boundaries
(e.g., CBP residues R1081-G1198) were bromodomain subcloned
into pNIC-BIO1 vector, a derivative from pNIC28-Bsa4 vector
(Gene Bank: EF198106) containing a 10 His-tag and TEV protease
cleavage site at the N-terminus and an in frame biotinylation
sequence (SSKGGYGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) inserted at the C-terminus. The constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3)-R3-BirA cell
line (BL21 derivative coexpressing BirA using a pACYC coexpression vector). Cells were grown overnight at 37 C in 10 mL of LuriaBertani medium with 50 mg/mL kanamycin and 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol. The start-up culture was diluted 1:1000 in fresh
medium and cell growth was allowed at 37 C to an optical density
of about 1.0 (OD600) before the temperature was decreased to
25 C. D-Biotin was dissolved into 10 mM bicine pH8.3 and added

www.aacrjournals.org

to the culture at 500 mM ﬁnal. The protein expression was induced
for 8 hours at 25 C with 50 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Proteins were puriﬁed using Ni-afﬁnity chromatography and
size exclusion chromatography.
Thermal shift assay
Thermal melting experiments were carried out using an
Mx3005p Real-Time PCR machine (Stratagene) as described
(23). Proteins were buffered in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM
NaCl, and assayed in a 96-well plate at a ﬁnal concentration of 2
mM in 20 mL volume. Compounds were added at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM. SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes) was added as
a ﬂuorescence probe at a dilution of 1:1000.
AlphaScreen assay
Assays were performed as described previously (24), with
minor modiﬁcations from the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer). A 11-point 1:2.5 serial dilution of the ligands was prepared
over the range of 5000–0 mM and 0.1 mL transferred to lowvolume 384-well plates ﬁlled with 5 uL of the assay buffer
(ProxiPlate-384 Plus, PerkinElmer), followed by 7 uL of biotinylated peptide H-ALREIRRYQK(ac)STELLIRKLK(biotin)-OH and
His-tagged protein to achieve ﬁnal assay concentrations of 50 nM.
Plates were sealed and incubated for a further 30 minutes before
the addition of 8 ml of the mixture of streptavidin-coated donor
beads (12.5 mg/ml) and nickel chelate acceptor beads (12.5 mg/ml)
under low light conditions.
Cell culture and reagents
Human cell lines (MOLM13, MONOMAC, THP1, KOCL45,
RS4;11, SEM, MV4;11, KOCL44, KOPN8, KASUMI-1, MUTZ5,
HL60, K562, PL21, REH, U937) were obtained from ATCC and
the Leibnitz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (www.dsmz.de). Cell lines were cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin (Gibco).
Synthesis of I-CBP112 and related analogues will be described
elsewhere. The inhibitor was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM and diluted further in culture medium RPMI-1640
immediately before use.
I-CBP112 in an in vivo model of MLL-AF9þ leukemia
Leukemic blasts expressing MLL-AF9 were treated in liquid
culture with 5 mM of I-CBP112 for 3 days. Control cells were
exposed to the corresponding concentration of the DMSO vehicle.
The 50  103 treated cells were then transplanted into sublethally
irradiated (600Rad) syngeneic mice via tail vein injection. Upon
the development of signs of disease, the mice were sacriﬁced and
analyzed. All experiments were done according to Swiss laws for
animal welfare and approved by the Swiss Cantonal Veterinary
Ofﬁce of Basel (Basel, Switzerland).
RNA preparation and gene expression proﬁling
KASUMI-1, SEM, and MOLM13 cells were treated with 3 M
of I-CBP112 or the DMSO vehicle for 4 days. On the third day
of treatment, the cells were replated in fresh medium with or
without the inhibitor. Total RNA was extracted using the RNA
extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, GmbH & Co.) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Primers for q-PCR and chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Crystallization and structure solution
Aliquots of the puriﬁed proteins were set up for crystallization
using a mosquito crystallization robot (TTP Labtech). Coarse
screens were typically set up onto Greiner 3-well plates using
three different drop ratios of precipitant to protein per condition
(100þ50 nL, 75þ75 nL, and 50þ100 nL). All crystallizations were
carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4 C.
CBP crystals with I-CBP112 (2 mM ﬁnal concentration) were
grown by mixing 200 nL of the protein (8.6 mg/ml) with 100 mL of
reservoir solution containing 0.10 M MgCl2, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0,
20% PEG 6K, and 10% ethylene glycol. Crystals were cryo-protected using the well solution supplemented with additional
ethylene glycol and were ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data
were collected at diamond beamline I04 at a wavelength of
1.0121 Å. Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using
an ensemble of known bromodomain models (PDB IDs 2OSS,
2OUO, 2GRC, 2OO1, 3DAI, 3D7C, 3DWY). The models and
structure factors have been deposited with PDB accession codes:
4NR6. Additional experimental details are available in Supplementary Data.

Results
Discovery of I-CBP112
On the basis of the reported weak CBP/p300 bromodomain
binding activity of BET inhibitors such as JQ1 and I-BET762 we
analyzed the CBP/p300 activity of a series of related compounds
that all contained a benzo-oxazepine core structure (Fig. 1A). Hit

expansion at several positions led to I-CBP112 with good activity
against CBP/p300. The description of the structure activity relationship (SAR) of this compound class as well as the synthesis of
I-CBP112 and its intermediates will be reported elsewhere.
I-CBP112 is a potent and selective CBP/p300 inhibitor
We used temperature shift assays for the characterization of
I-CBP112 potency and selectivity within the bromodomain family. This assay monitors binding of an inhibitor to a protein based
on the magnitude of temperature stabilization (23). I-CBP112
showed signiﬁcant stabilization of CBP/p300 melting temperatures (7.8 C and 8.6 C, respectively) while DTm values were low
for 41 other members of the human bromodomain family suggesting excellent selectivity of the developed inhibitor (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Table S1). We investigated I-CBP112 selectivity
further using biolayer interferometry (BLI) as an additional selectivity screening technology. Similar to the related surface plasmon
resonance, this technology measures interactions of ligands with
biomolecules immobilized on a surface monitoring changes in
refractive index. To conﬁrm the selectivity of I-CBP112, we
screened a panel of 42 representative bromodomains that were
homogenously biotinylated in vivo during recombinant expression. BLI conﬁrmed the excellent selectivity measured by temperature shift experiments identifying only bromodomains of the
BET family members as having weak off-target activity (Supplementary Fig. S1). Finally, we determined afﬁnity of I-CBP112 for
CBP/p300 in solution using isothermal titration calorimetry

(ITC), which resulted in determination of a dissociation constant
(Kd) of 151  6 nmol/L and 167  8 nmol/L for CBP and p300,
respectively (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S2). Dose-dependent
BLI experiments resulted in a comparable Kd value for CBP (Kd:
142 nmol/L; Fig. 1D). The most signiﬁcant off-target activity in
our selectivity screen was against BRD4, which showed a DTm of
2.1 C and 0.6 C for the ﬁrst [BRD4(1)] and second [BRD4(2)]
bromodomain, respectively. ITC titrations resulted in the determination of Kds of 5.6 mmol/L and 20 mmol/L for BRD4(1) and
BRD4(2), demonstrating 37 and 132 fold selectivity, respectively
(Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S2).
To assess selectivity of I-CBP112 outside the bromodomain
family, we screened both stereoisomers against a commercial
selectivity panel including 104 binding assays monitoring
binding to nuclear receptors, ion channels, and 32 enzyme assays
(including 10 kinases, 9 proteases, and 5 phosphodiesterases).
Both I-CBP112 stereoisomers showed similar behavior when
screened against this panel that revealed only weak interaction
with two GPCRs (a1A and 5HT1) in the low micromolar
region (Supplementary Table S3). The S-isomer was selected as
chemical probe compound and was used in all subsequent
cellular assays.
I-CBP112 is an acetyl-lysine competitive inhibitor
To establish a functional assay we studied the speciﬁcity of the
CBP bromodomain towards histone peptide target sequences by
synthesizing acetylated and nonacetylated histone peptides on a
SPOT cellulose array (19). We found that the CBP bromodomain
did not bind nonacetylated control peptides conﬁrming high
speciﬁcity for the acetyl-lysine modiﬁcation (Fig. 2A). The peptide
screening data revealed strong interaction of CBP with the histone-3 acetylated lysine 56 (H3K56ac), a CBP HAT substrate site,
as well as interaction with H3K36ac and H3K79ac and H4K12ac
and H4K44ac. Polyacetylation seemed to increase binding for
some of the histone H4 acetylation marks. However, ITC data
showed that the CBP bromodomain had similar afﬁnities for
mono- and diacetylated peptides and the determined stoichiometries of 0.5 for polyacetylated peptides suggested that two
bromodomains simultaneously bound one diacetylated peptide
supporting a canonical binding model in which one acetyl-lysine
interacted with one CBP bromodomain (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Table S4). The strongest interaction was observed with H3K56ac
(Kd ¼ 13.8 mmol/L), which was used for the development of an
Ampliﬁed Luminescence Proximity Homogeneous Assay
(AlphaScreen; ref. 24). However, we ﬁnd it likely that additional
interaction with acetylation sites other than H3K56ac may occur in
the context of intact chromatin in cells. The developed assay
demonstrated that I-CBP112 is an acetyl-lysine–competitive
inhibitor displacing H3K56ac from the CBP-binding site with an
IC50 value of 170 nmol/L (Fig. 2C).
Cocrystallization of the R-isomer of I-CBP112 with the bromodomain of CBP conﬁrmed the acetyl-lysine mimetic nature of this
inhibitor. The structure of the complex was reﬁned at 1.6 Å
resolution (Supplementary Table S5). The inhibitor was well
deﬁned by electron density allowing assignment of its binding
mode (Fig. 2D). As expected, the carbonyl group branching off the
oxazepine ring acted as an acetyl-lysine mimetic moiety forming a
hydrogen bond with the conserved asparagine (N1168 in CBP) as
well as a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Y1125. The ﬁve water
molecules that are typically present in bromodomain inhibitor and
substrate complexes (25) were also conserved in the I-CBP112/CBP

5112 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

complex (Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, I-CBP112 bound with an induced
ﬁt binding mode, leading to an outward movement of the side
chain of R1173. This movement creates a deep pocket that accommodates the dimethoxyphenyl ring system forming an aromatic
stacking interaction with the R1173 side chain (Fig. 2F).
CBP remains bound to chromatin in the presence of I-CBP112
We next investigated whether I-CBP112 could dissociate CBP
from chromatin using a ﬂuorescent recovery after photo bleaching
(FRAP) assay (26). Full-length CBP contains a large number of
protein and DNA interaction domains (Fig. 3A). FRAP measurements using a GFP-tagged full-length CBP construct did not lead
to decreased recovery times when treated with I-CBP112, or when
a conserved key residue for acetyl-lysine interaction (N1168) was
mutated to phenylalanine (N1168F), indicating that full-length
CBP cannot be displaced from chromatin by bromodomain
inhibitors (Fig. 3B). We used the pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA to
increase chromatin acetylation levels. In agreement with FRAP
data using I-CBP112 and site-directed mutants, SAHA treatment
did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ﬂuorescent recovery times of fulllength CBP, suggesting that tight chromatin association of CBP is
not exclusively acetylation-dependent and is primarily mediated
by interaction domains other than the bromodomain. To verify
that I-CBP112 bound to the CBP bromodomain in nuclei of cells,
we cloned the CBP bromodomain fused to a nuclear localization
signal and a GFP tag. The assay window obtained for this construct
was small, which was expected considering the low afﬁnity of
isolated bromodomain with acetylated histone tails. However,
expression of three bromodomains (3xCBPBRD/GFP) fused in
frame by a linker region resulted in a GFP fusion protein that
showed signiﬁcant increase in FRAP signal after SAHA treatment
and provided a sufﬁcient assay window when compared with the
N1168F-mutant construct. Exposure to 1 mmol/L I-CBP112
signiﬁcantly reduced FRAP signal after SAHA treatment demonstrating that I-CBP112 can indeed target the CBP bromodomain
in the nucleus and is capable of competing with acetyl-lysine–
mediated interactions of the CBP bromodomain in cellular environments (Fig. 3C). Representative data of beached nuclei as well
as normalized ﬂuorescent recovery data are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. We conﬁrmed these observations by a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay using NanoLuc
Luciferase fusions of full-length CBP and the isolated CBP bromodomain as well as Halo-tagged Histone H3.3, which was
readily incorporated into chromatin (Fig. 3D), as BRET pairs. In
agreement with our FRAP experiments, dose response experiments revealed that I-CBP112 had no signiﬁcant effect on the
recruitment of full-length CBP to chromatin, whereas a construct
containing the bromodomain was readily replaced with a cellular
IC50 value of 600  50 nmol/L (Fig. 3E) conﬁrming cellular
activity of I-CBP112 inhibiting acetylation-dependent CBP bromodomain-mediated interactions.
Phenotypic responses of CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition
To get insight on the wider consequences of CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition in cellular systems, we exposed a panel of
12 stimulated primary human cocultured cell types (BioMAP)
with I-CBP112 and monitored a broad array of protein biomarkers. This unbiased approach has been well established to assess
target-speciﬁc phenotypic responses by proving a phenotypic
ﬁngerprint of an inhibitor based on a large number of marker

Selective Inhibitor for CBP/p300 Bromodomains

proteins (27). For I-CBP112, the analysis of BioMAP data revealed
a modest but robust response on the expression of some of the
measured protein markers. Comparison with ﬁngerprints generated by well-established BET bromodomain inhibitors, I-CBP112
revealed a very distinct phenotypic response (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Some effects of cytokine expression were
shared between BET and CBP/p300 inhibitors. Expression of the
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL10 or the vascular cell adhesion
protein 1 (VCAM1/CD106) for instance was downregulated by
both I-CBP112 as well as the BET inhibitor JQ1. In contrast to BET

inhibition, I-CBP112 had no effect on expression levels of a
number of marker proteins including for instance the chemokine
(C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) or the cell adhesion molecule
Selectin (CD62). In addition, we observed a number of differential responses comparing both inhibitors. Secreted IgG was for
instance strongly downregulated by the BET inhibitor JQ1, but it
was upregulated by I-CBP112. Using statistical methods comparing proﬁle similarity, we found that the BET bromodomain
inhibitors JQ1, PFI-1, and I-BET151 clustered closely together
(Pearson  0.6) in agreement with their reported selectivity for

Selective Inhibitor for CBP/p300 Bromodomains

BET bromodomains. I-CBP112 in contrast showed a distinct
phenotypic response (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, another bromodomain inhibitor that we developed recently, CBP30, that has potent
in vitro activity for the CBP/p300 bromodomain but also significant BET activity (28) clustered with I-CBP112 at low concentration but showed a clear BET bromodomain signature at 10
mmol/L as expected from its dual activity. Thus, exposure of the
BioMAP primary cell panel to I-CBP112 resulted in a unique
response on cytokine and marker protein expression.
I-CBP112 impairs clonogenic growth of immortalized murine
bone marrow cells
Next, we aimed to explore the anticancer potential of I-CBP112
in a CBP/p300-dependent transformation model. Chromosomal
translocations have been observed in patients after therapy with
topoisomerase inhibitors leading to MLL-CBP fusion proteins
that include the bromodomain. Expression of MLL-CBP has been
shown to immortalize mouse bone marrow cells in vitro but it has
a limited capacity of inducing leukemia in vivo (29). To address the
effect of I-CBP112 on MLL-CBP–driven transformation we therefore established an immortalized hematopoietic cell line by
retroviral expression of the MLL-CBP fusion in lineage marker
depleted mouse bone marrow cells and expansion by two rounds
of replating in methylcellulose. Interestingly, exposure of these
cells with I-CBP112 did not affect cell survival and signiﬁcant
cytotoxicity was only observed at high inhibitor concentrations
and after prolonged exposure (Fig. 4C). However, exposure to the
inhibitor signiﬁcantly reduced clonogenic growth of MLL-CBP
immortalized cells in methylcellulose, which became even more
apparent upon replating of the cells (Fig. 4D). I-CBP112 exposure
resulted in morphologic changes from large round compact, so
called class I type, to smaller and more loosely shaped colonies.
Wright–Giemsa–stained cytospots of treated cells harvested from
methylcellulose revealed morphologic changes, indicating differentiation of MLL-CBP–immortalized cells (Fig. 4E).
I-CBP112 pretreatment of MLL-AF9þ murine AML blasts
reduced the number of LICs and delayed induction of the
disease upon transplantation into irradiated recipients
We next studied the efﬁcacy of I-CBP112 on leukemic cells
isolated from mice transplanted with bone marrow retrovirally
expressing fusion oncogenes (Fig. 5A; ref. 30). Treatment of
primary murine MLL-AF9þ leukemic blasts with I-CBP112 signiﬁcantly impaired self-renewal in clonogenic replating assays in
methylcellulose without signiﬁcant cytotoxicity and induced signiﬁcant morphologic cellular differentiation (Fig. 5B–D). Similar
results were obtained in bone marrow cells in vitro immortalized
by expression of the NUP98-HOXA9 or the MLL-AF9 fusion
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The observation of reduced in vitro

clonogenic growth (Fig. 5C) and absence of general toxicity (Fig.
5D) suggested that I-CBP112 might selectively reduce the number
of leukemia-initiating cells (LIC) often also referred as leukemic
stem cells. We therefore addressed the stem frequency of MLLAF9–expressing blasts in methylcellulose by extreme limiting
dilution analysis (ELDA; ref. 31) and found that treatment of the
cells with 5 mmol/L I-CBP112 for 3 days resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in the estimated stem cell frequency (Fig. 5E).
In contrast to MLL-CBP, the MLL-AF9–driven mouse AML can be
efﬁciently propagated by transplantation into irradiated recipient
mice (30), making it an ideal model to study the antileukemic
potential of CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition in vivo. We
ﬁrst carried out a pharmacokinetic study in mice to assess suitability of I-CBP112 for progression into xenograft models. Intraperitoneal administration of the compound at 3 mg/kg yielded
moderate systemic exposure of the compound with a mean Cmax of
590 ng/mL [1.26  0.74 mmol/L (n ¼ 3)], an AUC of 384 ng/h/mL
and a half-life of 0.6  0.1 hours. Intravenous administration (1.2
mg/kg) revealed high blood clearance, moderate volume distribution, and comparison with intraperitoneal dosing suggested that ICBP112 was bioavailable F%: 114  63 (AUCt/Dip)/(AUC¥/Div).
Because of the modest pharmacokinetic properties of ICBP112, we used a pretreatment scheme to obtain a preliminary
evaluation of I-CBP112 in vivo activity (Fig. 5A). I-CBP112 exposure of the cells for 3 days (5 mmol/L) in liquid cultures led to
minor changes of expression of cell surface markers, only c-Kit/
CD117 and granulocyte marker Gr-1 were slightly decreased
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
We then compared disease initiation in vivo by transplanting ICBP112 or DMSO pretreated MLL-AF9þ AML cells in limited
dilutions into secondary recipients. We observed that in doses
from 5–50  103 cells, mice receiving treated cells developed the
disease signiﬁcantly later. Transplantation of as little as 500
control cells induced AML in all recipients after 50 days. In
contrast, only 1 mouse transplanted with 500 I-CBP112–treated
cells developed the disease only after a long latency (Fig. 5F and
Supplementary Fig. S6). Collectively, these data demonstrate that
exposure of murine MLL-AF9þ leukemic blasts to the I-CBP112
CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitor signiﬁcantly reduced colony
formation in vitro, as measured in the ELDA assay, and delayed
induction of AML upon transplantation into irradiated recipients.
I-CBP112 impairs the clonogenic growth of human leukemic
cells
To corroborate the observations made in the mouse model in the
human disease, we screened a panel of 18 human leukemic cell lines for
their sensitivity to I-CBP112. On the basis of the cancer cell line
encyclopedia (CCLE), none of these cell lines harbor any mutations in
the coding region of CBP or EP300 (Supplementary Table S4). Similar

to our observation on primary mouse leukemic blasts, we found that
I-CBP112 did not cause immediate cytotoxic effects (Supplementary
Figs. S7–S12). However, I-CBP112 signiﬁcantly reduced the clonogenic
growth in all 12 human cell lines that form visible colonies in
methylcellulose (Supplementary Fig. S8). We selected three leukemic cell lines with distinct genetic lesions: KASUMI-1 (AML1ETOþ), SEM (MLL-AF4þ), and MOLM13 (MLL-AF9þ/FLT3ITDþ) for more detailed studies. I-CBP112 signiﬁcantly impaired
clonogenic growth of all three lines in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 6A). I-CBP112 treatment resulted in dose-dependent G1
arrest of the cell cycle. Time-dependent analysis of KASUMI-1
cells showed a prominent G1 arrest at day 2 and 3 that was even
more pronounced at day 6 (Fig. 6B). Prolonged exposure of cells
to increasing concentrations of the compound in liquid culture
resulted in signs of apoptosis (as measured by 7-AAD/AnnexinV
staining) in KASUMI-1 cells at day 5, whereas MOLM13 and SEM
were less sensitive (Supplementary Figs. S9–S11).
We also tested the effects of I-CBP112 on clonogenic growth of
primary human cells. Exposure of cells from ﬁve different AML
patients to I-CBP112 showed a dose-dependent reduction in the
number of colonies and cells in methylcellulose. Similar to the
murine and human leukemic cell lines, I-CBP112–treated primary

5116 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

AML cells showed morphologic signs of differentiation (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, I-CBP112 exposure of peripheral CD34þ cells from three
healthy donors did not affect the colony number in methylcellulose. However, the size of the colonies was reduced, thus resulting
in a statistically not signiﬁcant tendency of lower overall cell
numbers (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S12). These observations
suggest that inhibition of the CBP/p300 bromodomain may have
therapeutic potential in AML by suppressing self-renewal.
I-CBP112 sensitizes human leukemic cells to BET inhibition
and doxorubicin
CBP/p300 and the BRD4 BET protein often colocalize on
active promoters (32). However, in contrast to inhibition of
BET bromodomains, blocking CBP/p300 BRDs by I-CBP112
resulted only in limited cytotoxicity. We therefore wondered
whether exposure of combinations of both BRD inhibitors
might show synergistic effects. In parallel, we also tested
whether I-CBP112 might enhance cytotoxicity of doxorubicin,
a clinically widely used genotoxic agent. We tested 8 different
concentrations of I-CBP112 ranging from 0.1875 mmol/L to 24
mmol/L in combination with 15 different concentrations of JQ1
and doxorubicin, respectively, in ratios ranging from 8:1 to

Selective Inhibitor for CBP/p300 Bromodomains

1:16 in WST1 proliferation/survival assays for KASUMI-1,
MOLM13, and SEM cells (Supplementary Fig. S12A and
S12B). As expected, JQ1 and doxorubicin alone showed low
nanomicromolar activity that was different for each of the three
cell lines. We analyzed the potential synergistic activity using
the Chou–Talalay method (33). We observed strong synergy
combining either JQ1 or doxorubicin with I-CBP112 except for
MOLM13 cells, in which synergism between doxorubicin and ICBP112 was less pronounced (Fig. 6E and F and Supplementary Fig. S12C and S12D). We also compared the impact of
these drug combinations on DNA damage by measuring
gH2AX foci formation and H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation. In
SEM and MOLM13, but not KASUM1 cells, increased gH2AX
foci and H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation was seen after treatment with the I-CBP112/JQ1 combination. Exposure to doxorubicin increased H2Ax phosphorylation and foci that were not
further increased by the combination with I-CBP112 (Supplementary Fig. S14). The combination of BET and CBP/p300 BRD
inhibitors is of particular interest as both target subfamilies
could be simultaneously targeted using a single agent with dual
activity.
I-CBP112 modulates transcription of key inﬂammatory genes
To address the transcriptional consequences of exposure to ICBP112, we performed microarray gene expression studies. We
compared the gene expression signatures from KASUMI-1,
MOLM13, and SEM leukemic cell lines that have been exposed
to I-CBP112 for 4 days in liquid culture, a time point where cellcycle alterations become detectable without any pronounced
effects on cellular viability (Supplementary Fig. S7). Exposure of
the three cell lines to I-CBP112 (3 mmol/L) resulted in transcriptional repression rather than activation. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identiﬁed signiﬁcantly regulated genes.
Heatmaps were generated for all genes identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly
altered (>1.5 FC, P < 0.01) in both KASUMI-1 and MOLM13
(Fig. 7A, left), or in all three of KASUMI-1, MOLM13, and SEM
(Fig. 7A, right). Interestingly, many of the repressed genes were
key regulators of immune response including the Fc fragment of
IgG, high-afﬁnity 1b, receptor (FCGR1B; CD64) playing an
important role in humoral immune response (34), or TNFSF13B
(B-cell–activating factor; B-lymphocyte stimulator; Delta4 BAFF)
a member of the TNF ligand family (35). The expression changes
of selected genes were conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7B) and found
to be consistent with the array data. A list of all deregulated genes
is compiled in Supplementary Tables S7–S9. To differentiate
between early and late transcriptional changes, we measured
mRNA levels at 8 hours and 4 days on a set of three representative
deregulated genes identiﬁed in the array study (Fig. 7C). For the
genes tested, stronger deregulation was observed after 4 days
exposure to I-CBP112.
We used ChIP in combination with PCR to detect p300 levels in
KASUMI-1 cells at promoter, enhancer, and exonic region of two
signiﬁcantly regulated genes: TNFSF13B and ID2. In agreement
with our FRAP data, we did not see signiﬁcant displacement of
p300 after 8-hour exposure with 3 mmol/L I-CBP112. At longer
exposure, however (4 days), we observed increased p300 occupancy at most regions investigated when compared with DMSOtreated cells, whereas control genes (IgG) were unaffected (Supplementary Fig. S16). Acetylation levels at p300/CBP substrate
sites (H3K56ac, H3K56ac), which are also P300/CBP bromodomain–binding sites, were signiﬁcantly reduced in particular after

4-day exposure to I-CBP112, suggesting that bromodomain inhibition affects also p300/CBP HAT activity at regulated gene
promoters.

Discussion
High-resolution crystal structures allowed to rationally design
several small molecules that selectively interact with high afﬁnity
to bromodomains of the BET family (19–22). BET inhibitors of
the benzodiazepine scaffold gave rise to the inhibitor I-CBP112,
the ﬁrst selective and potent inhibitor developed for CBP/p300
bromodomains. Together with the HAT inhibitor C646 and
inhibitors targeting other protein interaction domains the developed chemical probe extends the set of tool molecules targeting
this key chromatin protein. Several studies demonstrated that BET
inhibitors potently impaired the growth of cells originating from
hematologic and solid cancers (22, 27, 36, 37). Analysis of a large
number of different cell lines and primary murine and human
cells revealed that I-CBP112 selectively impaired aberrant leukemic self-renewal. In contrast, BET inhibitors, such as JQ1 or PFI-1
potently impaired proliferation, survival, and self-renewal not
only of cancer cells but also activated immune cells. This wide
window of cellular activity might result from blocking interaction
of BRD4 with a large number of super enhancer elements regulating multiple transcription factors including the Myc oncogene
(38, 39). Not surprisingly, conditional ablation of BRD4 in vivo
resulted in a severe phenotype due to stem cell depletion, for
example, in the small intestine (40). Conditional ablation of Cbp
in the hematopoietic system of adult mice led to an increase in
differentiation, quiescence, apoptosis, and defects in adult HSC
maintenance and self-renewal (5). Comparison with the observed
cellular phenotypes induced by I-CBP112 observed in this study
suggests that chemical inhibition of the CBP/p300 bromodomain
phenocopies some but not all of the cellular effects observed in
knockout studies including most remarkably defects in selfrenewal and increased differentiation of immortalized hematopoietic cells as well as primary leukemic blasts. Reduction of
colony formation by MLL-AF9–immortalized cells as shown by
the ELDA assay in vitro and impaired disease induction by ICBP112–treated leukemic blasts after transplantation strongly
suggest signiﬁcant activity of the compound on aberrant selfrenewal of leukemic cells.
Domain-speciﬁc functions have recently been addressed in a
systematic p300 deletion study in which loss of the p300 KIX or
CH1 domains have been reported to cause profound defects in
hematopoiesis, whereas deletion of other domains including the
p300 bromodomain lead to lineage-restricted effects (41). Deletion of the bromodomain only modestly impaired p300 hematopoietic function in B cells but the bromodomain was required
during T-cell development. Thus, the bromodomain interaction
module may only be required for a subset of albeit critical fraction
of CBP/p300 functions. Indeed, our FRAP and BRET experiments
demonstrated that wild-type full-length CBP/p300 or mutants
that lack the bromodomain interaction with acetylated histones
remained bound to chromatin in the presence of I-CBP112. The
lack of full displacement of CBP/p300 from chromatin may
explain the modest effects of I-CBP112 on gene transcription in
our microarray study that showed few genes upregulated greater
than 2-fold after treatment with I-CBP112. The observed modest
changes in gene transcription are however consistent with expression studies carried out using genetic deletion of CBP (5, 42, 43).

Picaud et al.

The small number of commonly regulated genes in all three cell
lines tested was surprising, suggesting a strong context dependence of CBP/p300–regulated transcriptional events.
The role of CBP/p300 in human leukemogenesis is complex.
Conditional knock-in of MLL-CBP in mice revealed that the
fusion protein selectively expanded granulocyte/macrophage progenitors and enhanced their self-renewal/proliferation (44). In
the MLL-CBP fusion, the bromo/HAT domain is maintained and
required for the transforming activity of this oncogene (29). CBP/
p300 was also found to regulate the transcriptional activity of the
AML1-ETO fusion driving AML-M2 by posttranslational modiﬁcation (12). CBP/p300 also seem to cooperate with the c-MYB
proto-oncogene in cellular transformation by different leukemiaassociated fusions including AML1-ETO, AML1-ETO9a, MLLENL, and MLL-AF9 (45). These observations suggest that the
block of aberrant self-renewal in leukemic cells mediated by ICBP112 might be the consequence of multiple activities inﬂuenced by the driver fusion oncogenes and multiple protein–
protein interactions of CBP/p300. It has been estimated that
CBP/p300 physically or functionally interact with close to 400
proteins acting as a coactivator of many transcription factors
including NF-kB, HIF-1a, p53, or b-catenin that are known key
regulators of leukemogenesis (46). It is likely that some of these
interactions are inﬂuenced by the bromodomains. The p300
bromodomain for instance, has been reported to be required for
recognition of speciﬁc acetylated lysine residues in p53 (47–49).
We have recently observed that p53-dependent induction of the
cell-cycle inhibitor p21 by genotoxic stress might be dependent on
the CBP/p300 BRD. Interestingly we also found regulation of
some p53 target genes at early time points in I-CBP112–treated
KASUMI-1 leukemic cells (Supplementary Fig. S15). Hence, we
found that the combination of I-CBP112 with doxorubicin
resulted in signiﬁcantly cytotoxicity in leukemic cells. Interestingly, we also saw also synergy between the BET inhibitor JQ1 and ICBP112. Previous studies have shown synergistic cytotoxic activity of BET inhibitors with some HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA or
LBH-589 in Myc induced murine lymphoma (50). Thus, small
molecules CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitors may have not
only the potential to improve current therapies by selectively
targeting aberrant self-renewal linked to disease relapse but also to
enhance protocols combining BET inhibitors and traditional
chemotherapy and suggest to further explore dual inhibitors
targeting CBP/p300 and BET family bromodomains for their
anticancer potential. Several compounds with dual BET and
CBP/p300 activity have been developed in our laboratory demonstrating that selective targeting bromodomains of both bromodomain subfamilies is feasible using a single agent.
