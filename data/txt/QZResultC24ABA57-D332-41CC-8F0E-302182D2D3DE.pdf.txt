ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have poor prognosis due to the
aggressive metastatic behaviors. Our study reveals that expression of estrogen related
receptor α (ERRα) is significantly (p < 0.01) positively associated with high grade tumors
and lymph node metastasis, while negatively correlated with overall survival (OS), in
138 TNBC patients. Targeted inhibition of ERRα by its inverse agonist XCT-790 or si-RNA
obviously inhibits in vitro motility of TNBC cells. While over expression of ERRα triggers the
invasion and migration of TNBC cells. Further, si-ERRα and XCT-790 inhibit the epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells with increasing the expression of E-cadherin
and decreasing fibronectin (FN) and vimentin. While XCT-790 has no effect on the
expression of EMT related transcription factors such as Snail or Slug. Further, inhibitors
of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB signal molecules, which are activated by XCT-790, can not
attenuate the suppression effects of XCT-790 on EMT. Alternatively, luciferase reporter
gene assays and ChIP analysis indicate that ERRα can directly bind with FN promoter
at ERR response element-3 (ERRE-1), ERRE-3, and ERRE-4, while XCT-790 reduces this
bond. In vivo data show that ERRα expression is significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with
FN in clinical TNBC patients. In MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft models, XCT-790 decreases
the expression of FN, inhibits the growth and lung metastasis, and suppresses the EMT.
Our results demonstrate that ERRα functions as a metastasis stimulator and its targeted
inhibition may be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment.

therapeutics (Trastuzumab and Lapatinib) [1]. Further,
TNBCs are associated with increased risks of metastasis
and high rates of recurrence. So far there is no FDA (Food
and Drug Administration)-approved targeted therapy for
TNBC patients. Therefore, TNBC patients have the worst
prognosis and shortest survival rates among all subtypes of
breast cancer [2]. There is an urgent need to develop targeted
therapy approaches for TNBC treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by
lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PGR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER-2) [1]. Since the lack of common therapeutic
targets, TNBCs are neither susceptible to endocrine therapy
(Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) nor to targeted

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
developmental process in which epithelial cells lose
polarity and develop a mesenchymal phenotype [3]. It
has been considered as the initiation process of cancer
metastasis including TNBC [3]. Tumor occurring EMT
can acquire invasive mesenchymal phenotypes, increase
motility and invasiveness, and infiltrate into the tumor
vascular. The EMT is positively correlated with tumor
progression, maintenance, drug resistance, and metastasis
[4, 5]. The progression of EMT is promoted by several
important transcription factors such as Snail, Slug,
Twist and Zeb [6]. Activation of multiple cellular signal
pathways such as MAPK, PI3K, NF-κB, and Wnt/βcatenin also can trigger the EMT process [5, 7]. Increasing
evidences show that the progression of TNBC, the most
aggressive metastatic behavior of breast cancer subtype,
is associated with the process of EMT [8, 9]. Further,
EMT related signal pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/
Akt are highly activated in TNBC cells [10]. Therefore the
inhibition of EMT might be a potential strategy to improve
the prognosis of TNBC patients.
The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) is an
orphan member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone
receptors [11]. It has similar structure with estrogen
receptor (ER) and controls the expression of genes related
to cell metabolism such as tricarboxylic acid cycle [12]
and aerobic glycolysis [13, 14]. Levels of ERRα have
been reported to be elevated in the more-aggressive
tumors in breast cancer [15–17] as well as other types of
tumors [18], which are associated with a worse prognosis.
XCT-790, the specific inverse agonist of ERRα, can
inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells [19, 20].
The ablation of ERRα in knock-out mice delays ERBB2induced mammary gland tumorigenesis [21]. Further,
studies revealed that inactivation of ERRα impairs
in vitro migration of breast cancer cells [17, 22], while

over expression of ERRα in xenografted breast cancer
cells increases their metastatic capacities by induction of
tumoral angiogenesis and up regulation of VEGF [23–25].
However, the roles of ERRα in TNBC progression and
whether it is related to EMT process are still not studied.
In the present study, we show that inactivation of
ERRα suppresses the migration and invasion of TNBC
cells via inhibition the process of EMT both in vitro
and in vivo. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that
inactivation of ERRα decreases its binding affinity with
the promoter of fibronectin (FN) and then down regulates
the transcription of FN. Therefore, our findings suggest
that inhibition of ERRα might represent a novel targeted
therapy in TNBC metastasis.

RESULTS
Expression of ERRα is negatively correlated with
prognosis in TNBC patients
To date there were very limited data concerning
the relationship of ERRα expression with prognosis of
TNBC patients, we then performed immunohistochemistry
for ERRα in a set of 138 TNBC tumors. Table 1 shows
that elevated ERRα is significantly associated with high
grade tumors (p = 0.035) and lymph node metastasis (p <
0.001) of TNBC. Kaplan-Meier analysis of all 138 patients
demonstrated a statistically significant negative correlation
between overall survival (OS) and ERRα expression level
(p < 0.001). Further, statistical comparison of survival
between groups with the log-rank statistic analysis suggested
that patients whose tumors express increased levels of ERRα
had poorer survival compared with those with low levels of
ERRα (p < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure S1). These data
suggested that increased expression of ERRα resulted in a
more aggressive phenotype in TNBC patients.

ERRα facilitates the in vitro motility of
TNBC cells

mRNA levels in both MDA-MB-231 (Figure 2E and 2F)
and BT-549 (Supplementary Figure S4) cells via both time
and concentration dependent manners, while had limited
effects on the mRNA of Vim in these two cell lines. This
was also confirmed by the results that si-ERRα obviously
prevent (Supplementary Figure S5) while over expression
ERRα significantly promote (Supplementary Figure S6)
the EMT in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these
observations showed ERRα can trigger the progression of
EMT in TNBC cells, while targeted inhibition of ERRα by
XCT-790 suppresses this process.

Clinical data revealed that elevated ERRα is
significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, then
we investigated the roles of ERRα in the motility of TNBC
cells. As shown in Figure 1A, the expression of ERRα
was low in MCF-7 and T47D cells, which have little
metastatic powers, while was relatively high in MDAMB-231, BT-549 and HS578T cells, which are capable
of metastasizing. Then the roles ERRα on motility of
TNBC cells were further investigated by use of in vitro
wound-healing and transwell invasion assay. As shown
in Figure  1B, treatment with 1 μM XCT-790 for 24 h
obviously inhibited wound closure of both MDA-MB-231
and BT549 cells as compared to the control group. Further,
the number of invaded MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells
treated with 1 μM XCT-790 for 48 h was significantly
(p < 0.05) less than that of control cells (Figure 1C). In
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with ERRα construct
for 24 h, the wound closure (Figure 1D) and invaded
cells (Figure 1E) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased
as compared to the control group. To further verify the
role of ERRα inhibition on cell motility, we knocked
know ERRα in MDA-MB-231 cells by it specific siRNA.
The results showed that si-ERRα significantly inhibited
wound closure and in vitro invasion of MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Cell viability analysis
revealed that these treatments had no significant (p > 0.05)
effect on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and BT549
cells (data not shown). Collectively, our results revealed
that ERRα can significantly trigger the motility of TNBC
cells, its inhibition or knockdown can inhibit the migration
and invasion of TNBC cells.

EMT related transcription factors and signal
pathways including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB
do not mediate the suppression effects of XCT790 on EMT
Since transcription factors Snail, ZEB1, Twist and
Slug play essential roles in regulating EMT [4], we then
investigated whether their expressions were altered in
TNBC cells treated with XCT-790. Our results showed
that XCT-790 treatment had no significant effect on the
protein expression of Snail, Slug, Twist or ZEB1 in either
MDA-MB-231 or BT-549 cells for various concentrations
(Figure 3A). Cellular signal pathways including MAPK,
PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, p53, Smad, and Stat3 are suggested
to promote the progression of EMT in cancer cells [5].
Then their statuses in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 5
μM XCT-790 for 30 or 60 min were checked by Western
blot analysis. The results showed that XCT-790 slightly
increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, p38MAPK, p65, and Akt, while had no obvious effect on
other signalling molecules such as p53, Smad2, or Stat3
(Figure 3B). To verify whether ERK1/2, JNK, p38MAPK, p65, and Akt mediate the suppression effects of
XCT-790 on EMT, we pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells
with their inhibitor for 90 min and then exposed to XCT790 for another 48 h. The results showed that inhibitors
of ERK1/2, JNK, p38-MAPK, PI3K/Akt, PKA, or NF-κB
can not attenuate XCT-790 induced FN down regulation
and E-Cad up regulation (Figure 3C). Our data suggested
that EMT related transcription factors and signal pathways
including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB do not mediate the
suppression effects of XCT-790 on EMT.

Targeted inhibition of ERRα suppressed the
EMT of TNBC cells
Increasing evidences show that the progression
of TNBC is associated with the process of EMT [8, 9].
We then hypothesized that ERRα plays a positive role
in the progression of EMT. Our results revealed that
MDA-MB-231 cells treated with XCT-790 (Figure 2A)
or transfected with si-ERRα (Supplementary Figure S3)
lost their spindle-like fibroblast appearance and assumed
a cobblestone-like epithelial morphology. Inversely, over
expression of ERRα was associated with an increase of
aggressive cell types (Figure 2B). This was also confirmed
by Western blot analysis on XCT-790 treated MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 2C) and BT-549 (Figure 2D) cells,
which showed an increased expression of the epithelial cell
marker E-Cadherin (E-cad), and an decreased expression
of the mesenchymal cell markers FN and vimentin (Vim)
via both time and concentration dependent manners.
Furthermore, qRT-PCRs analysis showed that XCT-790
treatment down regulated FN while up regulated E-Cad at
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Targeted inhibition of ERRα directly inhibited
the expression of FN
Since transcription factors and the above
signal pathways did not mediated the suppression
effects of XCT-790 on EMT, we then investigated
whether EMT biomarkers were directly regulated
by ERRα. We analyzed the human FN and CDH1
(E-Cad gene) promoter sequence in silico to detect
potential ERR response element (ERRE) composed
of the extended ERE half-site AAGGT (or its reverse

complement ACCTT) [18, 26]. As show in Figure 4A,
four potential ERREs were found located within the
proximal promoter of FN. Then we transfected the
promoter reporter gene plasmid pGL3-Basic-FN-luc
into MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells and then treated
with XCT-790 for the indicated times or concentrations.
Our data showed that XCT-790 significantly decreased
the activity of pGL3-Basic-FN-luc in MDA-MB-231
(Figure 4B) and BT-549 (Figure 4C) cells via both time
and concentration dependent manners. It suggested that
XCT-790 can inactivate the promoter of FN thereby
decreasing the transcription of FN.
We next performed a ChIP assay to test whether
ERRα binds to FN promoter in the native chromatin
environment of TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with 5 μM XCT-790 for 24 h, results showed
that ChIP with a human ERRα-specific antibody resulted
in a significant decrease in the genomic fragment that
contained the ERRE-1 (0.74 fold), ERRE-3 (0.78-fold),
and ERRE-4 (0.67-fold) sites in the FN promoter. As
negative control, weak precipitation was detected with
the use of no antibody or anti-rabbit IgG. Together, these
data suggested that XCT-790 can inhibit the bind between
ERRα and cis-regulatory domain of the endogenous FN
promoter and then suppress the transcription of FN.

XCT-790 on metastasis of MDA-MB-231 tumor
xenografts in nude mice. Our results revealed that the
average size of tumor in XCT-790 group was significantly
(p < 0.05) less than that of control ones at the end of
in vivo experiment (Figure 5A). Further, Western blot
analysis showed that XCT-790 treatment also significantly
decreased the expression of Vim while up regulated E-Cad
in primary tumors (Figure 5B). These data suggested that
ERRα inhibition suppresses the metastasis in nude mice
bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts via EMT suppression
of primary tumor. Interestingly, XCT-790 treatment also
decreased the expression of Snail and Slug in vivo, which
was contrary to in vitro results and needed further studies.
Further, XCT-790 reduced the number of metastases to the
lungs by 67%–85% (p < 0.05) compared with the control
group (Figure 5C). This was confirmed by histological
analysis which revealed that the extent of lung metastatic
lesions derived from control group was greater than that
of XCT-790 groups (Figure 5D). The data supported that
targeted inhibition of ERRα suppresses the metastasis of
TNBC in vivo by EMT suppression.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies revealed that ERRα has a positive
role in cancer cell migration and invasion [18, 21, 27].
One of the major characteristics of TNBC is aggressive
migration and invasion, while the role and mechanism of
ERRα on TNBC metastasis has not been well illustrated.
Our present study reveals that targeted inhibition of ERRα
can suppress the in vitro and in vivo motility of TNBC
cells via EMT suppression by directly down regulating
FN. Further, IHC results suggest elevated ERRα is
significantly positively associated with FN expression,
high grade tumors and lymph node metastasis, while
negatively associated with overall survival of 138
TNBC patients. These results suggest ERRα activation
as a mechanism of TNBC aggressiveness and imply that
targeting ERRα may be a promising approach for TNBC
treatment.
Our present study shows that targeted inhibition of
ERRα suppresses the migration and invasion of TNBC
both in vitro and in vivo. This is consistent with recent
studies that ERRα can down regulate RHOA stability [27]
or induce WNT11 expression [22] to increase cancer cell
migration, while knockdown of ERRα during the early
stages of zebrafish embryonic development results in
inhibition of cell migration [28]. The expression of ERRα
was also positively associated with markers of increased
recurrence and adverse clinical outcome, such as increased
expression of MYC oncogene, Ki-67 and AIB1 [16, 29, 30].
A molecular mechanism has been proposed linking ERRα
to the activation of Wnt11-elicited pathway leading
to increased N-cadherin expression [22], which is an
important mesenchymal biomarker for cancer cells [31].
These data confirm that ERRα plays a positive role in

The expression of ERRα was positively
correlated with FN in vivo
In vitro analysis showed that ERRα binds to FN
promoter and then activates its expression directly. To
evaluate the role of ERRα on in vivo FN expression, we
checked the relationship between ERRα and FN expression
in 138 TNBC tumors by immunohistochemistry. Of the
138 TNBC cases, 64 had elevated ERRα and 75 had low
levels of FN. The Fisher’s exact test showed that scores
for ERRα and FN immunostaining were significantly
correlated in 65.2% of tissues in this series (p < 0.001)
(Table 2). This result suggested that ERRα expression is
positively correlated with FN in clinical TNBC patients.
We then examined the in vivo effect of ERRα on the FN
expression in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts in nude mice
by tail vein injection of XCT-790. Western blot analysis
showed that XCT-790 treatment significantly decreased the
expression of FN in primary tumors (Figure 5B). Generally,
our data revealed that the expression of ERRα was
positively correlated with FN in vivo, while its inhibition
can suppress the FN expression.

Targeted inhibition of ERRα inhibited the
growth and metastasis of TNBC in vivo
As XCT-790 can suppress in vitro migration and
invasion of TNBC cells, a key question was whether
targeted inhibition of ERRα can inhibit metastatic
behaviors in vivo. We then examined the effect of

metastasis of TNBC cells, while its inhibition can suppress
the motility of TNBC cells.
Most TNBC patients exhibit gene expression
patterns associated with EMT [32]. EMT can endow
carcinoma cells with enhanced migratory and survival
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

abilities and is considered as the a first and key step in
cancer metastasis. When the EMT process is triggered,
epithelial cells lose the expression of intercellular adhesive
protein E-Cad and gain the mesenchymal markers such as
FN and Vim [5]. Our present results reveal that inhibition
25596

of ERRα by XCT-790 or siRNA suppressed aspects of
EMT in TNBC cells. While ectopic expression of ERRα
promotes the EMT and induction of epithelial markers. All
of these data confirm the positive role of ERRα in EMT
of TNBC cells. During this process, Vim only changed in
protein level rather than RNA level, which suggests that it
may just play a accompany role. Similarly, Lam et al. also
suggested that targeting ERRα inhibits EMT and stem cell
properties of ovarian cancer cells [33]. As EMTs account
for the aggressiveness and stemness of TNBC, targeting
the EMT-like phenotype becomes a unique strategy for
TNBC treatment. It is also worth noting that high levels of
ERRα are found in various cancers such as colon, prostate,
and ovarian cancers [18], suggesting that role of ERRα in
EMT may have broader implications for other tumor cell
types.
The mechanisms of ERRα in EMT progression are
not well illustrated. Lam et al. suggested that targeted
inhibition of ERRα inhibited the expression of Snail
through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional
regulation in ovarian cancer cells [33]. Inversely,
inhibition of ERRα has no effect on EMT related
transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, Twist, or ZEB.
This might be due to the variation among different
cancers. Further, although XCT-790 can slightly activate
ERK1/2, JNK, p38-MAPK, p65, and Akt, their inhibitors
have no effect on XCT-790 induced FN down regulation
and E-Cad up regulation. As a transcription factor, our
results indicate that XCT-790 can directly impair the
bind between ERRα and promoter of FN, then decrease
the transcription of FN (Figure 4). This was confirmed
by the results that XCT-790 decreases the protein and
mRNA levels and transcription activities of FN via both
time and concentration dependent manners. The human
FN promoter contains four ERREs which are suggested
to be bound by ERRα, while ChIP results suggest that
ERRE-1, ERRE-3, and ERRE-4 are the binding sites of
ERRα in TNBC cells. Among the extracellular matrix
(ECM) components, FN has often been used as one of
the mesenchymal markers whose expression is strongly
enhanced in EMT process [34]. Indeed, this is the first
demonstration that ERRα is a directly acting transcription
factor of the FN gene. Although we can not exclude
additional mechanisms by which ERRα induces FN, our
present study provides another mechanism for the positive
role of ERRα in cancer metastasis.
ERRα over expression is correlated with poor
outcome and bad prognosis in various cancer types such as
prostate, colorectal, cervical and ovarian carcinomas [35].
In support of such a role in TNBC patients, a survey of
138 clinical TNBC samples shows significant correlations
between increased ERRα levels and higher breast cancer
grade, metastasis, and unfavorable outcome. In addition,
the expression of ERRα and FN is significant positively
correlated with each other in 65.2% TNBC patients. This
suggests that over expression of ERRα might trigger the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastasis of TNBC cells via promoter EMT process
in human body through up regulation of FN. Our study
also revealed that ERRα has the potential to be used as a
marker of unfavorable prognosis of TNBC.
Our findings are important for several reasons. We
show that ERRα acts as mesenchymal function, which
provides another mechanism for the aggressive phenotype
of TNBC. We also present for the first time that ERRα
can directly bind to the promoter of FN and then increase
its expression. Further, ERRα can be an independent
prognostic marker and a unique therapeutic target, with
particular relevance to clinically aggressive TNBC. In
summary, our results, taken together with published
literatures, establish an essential role of ERRα in TNBC
progression and position it as an important target for
TNBC treatment. Considering that there is no efficiency
therapy target for TNBC, our findings are encouraging and
suggest that ERRα could be targeted for TNBC treatment
in the future.

and other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and
purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA) unless otherwise noted. Monoclonal antibodies
against FN, E-Cad, Vim, Snail, Slug, Twist, ZEB,
p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38 MAPK, p38
MAPK, p-p65, p65, p-IκB, IκB, p-p53, p53, p-Smad2,
Smad2, p-Stat3, Stat3, and GAPDH were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA).
Antibodies against p-Akt and Akt were purchased from
Bioworld Technology, Inc (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
All compounds were solubilized in DMSO. Medium
containing 0.5% DMSO was used as the control.

Cell culture and transfection
Cancer cell MCF-7, T47D, SkBr3, HS578T, MDAMB-231, BT-549, PC3, HepG2, and SkBr3 cells were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA), maintained in our laboratory, and
cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal Bovin serum, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere. An ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
25597

Oncotarget

Biosystems) was used for the profiling. The DNA profile
data were cross-checked with the ATCC data bank.
Medium was replaced with phenol red-free medium 24 h
before experiments to remove the estrogen-like activity of
phenol red. For transfection, cells were seeded into sixwell plates and transfectd with pcDNA3.1 (vector control),
ERRα construct (purchased from Addgene, Cambridge,
MA), siRNA negative control (siRNA-NC: 5′-GGC TAC
GTC CAG GAG CGC A-3′), or si-ERRα (sequence 5′GAG CAU CCC AGG CUU CUC A dT dT-3′) by use of
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).

determined by a luminometer, using a dual-luciferase assay
kit. Results were displayed as the ratios between the activity
of the reporter plasmid and pRL-TK [37].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assays were performed on MDA-MB-231
cells as previously described [20]. Briefly, cells were
incubated for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline
containing 1% formaldehyde. After sonication with
Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), soluble chromatin
fragments of 200 to 1000 bp in length were incubated with
5 μg of anti-hERRα antibody, rabbit anti-IgG antibody,
or no antibody for 16 h at 4°C, followed by incubation
with 80 μg of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose
for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed and
eluted. Samples were then treated with RNase A (Roche
Diagnostics) for 30 minutes at 37°C and with proteinase
K (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 h at 42°C. Isolated DNA
fragments were purified with QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen),
and quantitative PCRs were performed using 2 μl of DNA
in triplicate. The promoter of FN (–998 to +199) was
scanned for putative ERREs using the MAPPER search
engine [39]. The primers for four ERRE sites were listed
at Supplementary Table S1.

In vitro wound-healing and transwell invasion
assay
A wound-healing assay was used to compare the
migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells
as described previously [36]. The cell migration and
invasion assay was using 6-well transwell plates (Falcon
cell culture inserts, 8-μm pore size, BD, NJ) according
to our previous study [37]. The in vitro wound-healing
and transwell invasion assays were carried out at least 5
individual experiments.

Western blotting analysis
Western blotting was performed as previously
described [38].

Animal experiments
Nude mice were purchased from the Sun Yat-sen
University (Guangzhou, China) Animal Center and raised
under pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments
complied with the Zhongshan School of Medicine
Policy on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 106 per mouse) suspended in
100 μl 1640 medium were injected into the fourth right
mammary fat pad at the base of the nipple of nude mice
(n = 9) with 50% Matrigel (BD bioscience, Bedford,
MA). When the tumor was visible, mice of XCT-790
group were treated with XCT-790 (4 mg per kg, body
weight) by tail vein injection for six times for every three
days. When tumor volume at the control group reached
approximate 1000 mm3, mice were sacrificed, and the
tumors were removed and weighed for use in histology
and Western blot analysis. Tumor burden in the lung
was quantified by manually counting nodules visible on
the lung surface. Tumors and lungs were embedded in
paraffin for further study.

Quantitative real-time PCR
After treatment as indicated, total mRNA of cells
was extracted with TRIZOL reagent. Then the quantitative
real-time PCR for gene expression were conducted as our
previous method [36]. Transcripts of the housekeeping
gene GAPDH in the same incubations were used for
internal normalization. Primer pairs were as follows: FN,
forward 5′- CCC AGA CTT ATG GTG GCA ATT C-3′ and
reverse 5′- AAT TTC CGC CTC GAG TCT GA-3′; E-Cad
forward 5′- TAC ACT GCC CAG GAG CCA GA -3′ and
reverse 5′- TGG CAC CAG TGT CCG GAT TA -3′; Vim
forward 5′- TGA GTA CCG GAG ACA GGT GCA G -3′
and reverse 5′- TAG CAG CTT CAA CGG CAA AGT TC3′; ERRα forward 5′-CA ATG AGT GTG AGA TCA CC
-3′ and reverse 5′-CCG TTT GTA CTT CTG CCG TC-3′.

Reporter genes assay
The pGL3-Basic-FN-luc which contains FN promoter
with the sequence −998/+28 was the gift from Dr Tian Lan
at Guangdong Pharmaceutical University. For measuring
the transcriptional activity of FN, cells were transfected
with 0.2 μg DNA/cm2 per plasmid and lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and then treated with XCT-790 for the
indicated times. Transfection efficiency was normalized by
cotransfection with pRL-TK. Transcriptional activity was

Immunohistochemistry staining of formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue was conducted as previously
described [40]. Briefly, tumor tissues (both mice and
human) and lungs (mice) were fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 mm) were cut and
stained with H&E. For immunohistochemical staining,
sections were deparaffinized and hydrated, and
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3%
H2O2 in water for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was done
with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH6.0) for 10 min. Slides
were incubated with Biocare blocking reagent for 10 min
to block nonspecific binding. Then, they were incubated
with anti- ERRα, E-Cad, or FN overnight at 4°C. Slides
were washed in PBS twice and then incubated with goat
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and then
washed. Finally, slides were incubated with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine and counter stained with hematoxylin.

Statistical analysis
All values were reported as mean ± SD unless
otherwise specified. Data were analyzed by two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test between two groups and by OneWay ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test for multiple
comparison involved. The χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test
was used to analyze the association of ERRα expression
and clinical-pathological parameters or ERRα and FN
expression in clinical tissues. The survival curves were
plotted by using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Statistical analysis
was carried out using SPSS 16.0 for Windows. A p-value of
< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
