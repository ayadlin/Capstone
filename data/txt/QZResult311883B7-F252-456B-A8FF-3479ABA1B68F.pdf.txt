Perspective

Finding a Panacea among Combination Cancer Therapies
Ryuji Yamaguchi1 and Guy Perkins2

Abstract
Because each cancer is a heterogeneous mix of cancer cells at different stages of development, we are faced with
trying to treat many different diseased cells all at once. An authentic approach is to build a genomic and proteomic
proﬁle of a patient, identify the target oncogenes, and prescribe the combination of targeted drugs tailored for that
patient. However, there are many practical problems with this personalized medicine approach: (i) cancers often
generate treatment-resistant phenotypes, (ii) the treatment could be enormously expensive, and (iii) most of
the targeted drugs have not been developed yet. We propose a different approach: therapies that combine
2-deoxyglucose (2DG) with Bcl-2 antagonist such as ABT-263/737 (ABT). Proapoptotic protein Bak is normally
sequestered by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Only when Bak is released from both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can it induce apoptosis.
2DG can prime highly glycolytic cells by dissociating Bak-Mcl-1 complex. Some brain cells and most cancer cells
are primed by 2DG. ABT can bind to Bcl-xL, dissociating Bak-Bcl-xL complex, freeing Bak and inducing apoptosis.
Because ABT cannot cross blood–brain barrier, the only cells exposed to both agents are highly glycolytic cancer
cells located outside the brain. Because ABT directly triggers apoptosis at the step very near the terminal point of
apoptosis, 2DG-ABT combination therapies are applicable to many types of cancer at all stages of development,
with little side effect. Cancer Res; 72(1); 18–23. Ó2011 AACR.

Introduction
Genotoxin-based DNA-damaging agents and cell-cycle inhibitors cause damage to DNA, activating checkpoints and
inducing apoptosis in nearly all of the proliferating cells. Even
though severe side effects are associated with these therapies,
they are the most effective therapies in early stages of cancer.
However, as cancer progresses, cancer cells accumulate more
mutations, abrogating checkpoint functions and apoptosisinducing programs, making them resistant to genotoxin-based
treatments. More recently developed "targeted" therapies use
drugs that inhibit speciﬁc gene or mutated gene products
whose activities are important in cancer development and
growth in particular types of cancer. Generally they are less
toxic, yet their effects can be very dramatic, shrinking tumors
within days. However, there are many practical problems with
this approach. For example, inactivating one oncogene with its
many variants may not be possible with just one targeted drug
(1). Moreover, choosing just one oncogene in a complex cancer
genome to inactivate and eliminate a heterogeneous population of cancer cells is very difﬁcult and it may not be always
possible. Even when the right choice is made, showing dramatic tumor regression initially, there are numerous incidents

of cancer returning within a few years, in forms highly resistant
to the original therapy (2). To move beyond these limitations,
therapies using a combination of targeted drugs are being
envisioned as the best approach (2). However, to choose the
right combination, the genomic and proteomic proﬁle of each
patient's cancer may be required, raising the cost (see Micael
Stratton's comments in ref. 3). Furthermore, many of these
targeted drugs are not even developed yet, making this personalized medicine approach impractical (3). Finally, even with
the combination of targeted drugs, cancer could still generate
treatment-resistant cells by activating an alternate pathway.
We propose a different approach: search for a cancer therapy
that is applicable to many cancer types at different stages of
development. We believe this can be done by targeting cancer
cells with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) because they are highly glycolytic (4). Because 2DG also sensitizes cancer cells to Bcl-2
antagonists such as ABT (5), addition of a Bcl-2 antagonist to
2DG-treated cells mechanically activates Bak, circumventing
the usual signal transduction cascades required for Bak activation. Thus the combination could selectively induce apoptosis for cells with high glucose transporter activities. Indeed,
2DG-ABT can induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines
derived from many cancer types. It also eliminated p53-defective, PTEN-deleted, highly-metastasized cancer cells grafted
onto nude mice (5), for which the standard chemotherapies
and some targeted therapies had not worked. In this article, the
molecular mechanisms of 2DG-ABT combination therapies
and possible improvements will also be discussed.

The Complexity of Cancer
Incoming analyses from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project
already suggest enormous complexity of the cancer genome.

A Panacea for Cancer

an intermediate stage, suggesting that oncogenic addiction in
CML is limited to a particular stage of development.
Gleevec was also ineffective against acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) even though it frequently expresses the
bcr-abl protein. In treating AML and CML in blast crisis,
Gleevec usually caused very rapid cancer regression, only to
have cancer return within a short period of time in treatmentresistant forms (11). One reason for the resistance to Gleevec
in CML and AML is the expression of Src family of kinases that
can substitute for bcr-abl (12). Mutation in the Gleevec-binding
region of bcr-abl is thought to be another reason for the
generation of Gleevec-resistant cancer cells. Because p53 is
required for Gleevec-induced apoptosis, mutation in p53 could
also make CML cells resistant (ref. 13; Fig. 1B). The scenario is
remarkably similar to the treatment history of many targeted
drugs (2), including that of PLX4032, a speciﬁc B-RAF inhibitor,
used to treat metastasized melanomas. In the majority of cases,
PLX4032 induced rapid, near complete regression of tumors
within a few weeks. However, in 100% of the cases, cancer came
back within a year in PLX4032-resistant forms (14).
Generally, there are 3 ways that cancer can become resistant
to a targeted therapy:

For example, a typical solid tumor contains 30 to 80 somatic
mutations (6). Many researchers are actively engaged with
making annotations to each mutant gene. Some are the
expected standard mutations found in many cancer types
whereas others are unique to particular cancer types. Some
are so-called driver mutations, causally implicated in oncogenesis whereas others are passenger mutations, hitchhikers
on a clonal expansion, and some are totally unknown (6).
The ﬁndings conﬁrm that cancer is indeed a genetic disease.
The typical etiology of the disease is that it progresses
slowly, accumulating one mutation at time. But there seems
to be no ﬁxed schedule, nor a preset path. A cancer cell could
develop an unexpected mutation that could drive it in a
separate direction from the rest. Thus a tumor mass could
contain a heterogeneous population of cancer cells at many
different stages of development from which it might proceed
in all sorts of directions (7). Thus each cancer is unique in its
own way, deﬁned by its own set of mutations (Fig. 1A). The
challenge for cancer therapy is to ﬁnd a way to treat all these
diseased cells all at once.

Targeted Therapies
On the basis of a phenomenon called oncogenic addiction, in
which a speciﬁc cancer type becomes dependent on the
activities of just one oncoprotein for its growth and survival
(8), targeted therapies deploy a speciﬁc inhibitor for this
oncoprotein for treatment. The oncogene addiction model
gained credence when Gleevec, a speciﬁc inhibitor of bcr-abl,
successfully treated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
with remarkable efﬁcacy; 5-year incidence-free survival rates
reached more than 90% in most studies (9). However, Gleevec
could not eliminate CML completely because it could not
eliminate the cancer stem cell population (10), forcing treatment to be open-ended. Gleevec was also ineffective in treating
CML in blast crisis. Thus, Gleevec seems to be effective only at

(i) Mutations in the targeted oncogene, which make them
resistant to the speciﬁc targeted drugs. Examples:
Gleevec-resistant mutations in bcr-abl genes were found
in Gleevec-insensitive CML samples (1), and Tarcevaresistant mutations in ERBB3 were found in Tarcevainsensitive patients (2).
(ii) Expression of proteins that make the targeted protein
redundant. Example: COT expression and N-RAS and
PDGFRb upregulation were found in PLX4032-resistant
melanomas cells (reviewed in ref. 15), and
overexpression of Lyn, a member of Src kinase family,
was found in Gleevec-insensitive CML samples (16).

(iii) Loss of apoptosis-inducing programs that may be
needed when a targeted oncogene is inactivated.
Example: Loss of p53 makes CML cells resistant to
Gleevec-induced apoptosis (13).
These mutations may have been present in a small number
of cells in the initial tumor mass, or they may have developed
during the prolonged treatment. Trying to remedy the situation, more targeted drugs were developed in some cases. A new
drug targeting a different region of the same oncogene was
found effective in Gleevec-resistant CML patients (11).

Applying Personalized Medicine to Cancer
Treatment
When we examined the single-agent efﬁcacies of already
developed targeted drugs, except for one example (Gleevec),
they had all failed to extend life signiﬁcantly. In many cases,
targeted drugs did not even inhibit all variants of oncogenes
they are targeting (1). Compounding the problem is the ability
of cancer to develop an alternative signaling pathway, making
them independent of the targeted oncogene. Combining targeted drugs may certainly improve the efﬁcacy, but for the
combination to be effective, each patient's cancer genomic
proﬁle needs to be built. And even then, that is not a guarantee
of success as targeted drugs may not inhibit all the possible
variants of the targeted oncogene (1), or cancer may activate
alternative pathways for its survival (15, 16). In short, we
would not expect to know a priori how cancer responds
to a particular targeted drug and how they might possibly
become resistant to them, unless we have build signiﬁcant
experience with particular targeted drugs applied to particular
cancer types. Thus, it is our view that applying a personalized
medicine approach to treat cancer would face many obstructs.
Hence, searching for another approach that activates the
natural cell death pathways of body makes sense.

Inducing Apoptosis in Cancer Cells
In healthy individuals, unwanted cells and cells that threaten
our well-being are killed by inducing apoptosis-activating
programs. Genotoxin-based therapies target all proliferating
cells, inducing apoptosis through activation of cell-cycle checkpoint and genomic surveillance programs. Thus, even though
genotoxin-based therapies cause many side effects, unlike
targeted therapies in which only speciﬁc cancer types can be
treated, they can be applied to many cancer types at an early
stage of development. Rapidly dividing cancer cells are also
under pressure to compromise cell-cycle checkpoint and
genomic surveillance programs, the same programs that are
intermediary for genotoxin-induced apoptosis. As cancer progresses and accumulates more mutations, it seems natural that
it becomes more resistant to genotoxin-based therapies.
Therefore, to effectively treat advanced cancers, a different
approach is needed.
Another approach would be to directly activate apoptosis at
the most critical juncture in the apoptotic pathway. This would
be the step in which Bak or Bax are oligomerized, forming

20

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

mitochondrial outer membrane pores through which cytochrome c can escape to start the apoptotic cascade. The step is
often referred as the point of no return (17). Expression of BH3only proteins such as tBid or BimS or transfection of BH3
peptides can activate Bak/Bax and induce apoptosis in cancer
cells. They can also induce apoptosis in normal healthy cells
(18). Thus, there would be substantial side effects with this
approach. However, Bcl-2 antagonists, such as ABT-263 or
ABT-737 (ABT), could induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in only a limited set of cancer cells such as leukemia cells
and some small-cell lung carcinomas, yet leaving most of the
normal healthy cells intact.
The vast potential of ABT became apparent when we
realized that by preincubating cancer cells with deoxyglucose,
we could induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer types at a
submicromolar concentration of ABT (5). Furthermore, when
deoxyglucose was injected into animals, it predominantly
accumulated in cancer cells. Thus, we discovered a way to
target cancer cells in animals by simply injecting deoxyglucose
before the injection of ABT.

2DG-ABT Combination Therapy
Except for postmitotic cells such as neurons and muscle
cells, every cell in the body retains the capacity for self-sacriﬁce
through the apoptotic program. Proapoptotic protein Bak is
normally sequestered by Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Only when Bak is
released from both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL can it form oligomers on
the mitochondrial outer membranes through which cytochrome c can escape, thus initializing apoptosis. BH3 proteins
such as tBid or BimS or BH3 peptides such as SAHB can disrupt
the association of Bak to both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, thus freeing
Bak and releasing cytochrome c (19, 20). However, forced
expression of tBid or BimS, or peptide transfection of SAHB,
can also harm healthy cells (18). On the other hand, deoxyglucose is efﬁciently taken up by cancer cells and some brain cells,
disrupting the Bak-Mcl-1 association and priming only these
cells for Bcl-2 antagonist-induced apoptosis. When cells
primed by deoxyglucose are treated with ABT, the Bak-BclxL association is lost, inducing Bak oligomerization and apoptosis (Fig. 2). Even though deoxyglucose can potentially prime
brain cells for ABT-induced apoptosis, because ABT cannot
cross blood–brain barrier (21, 22), they are not targeted by the
combination therapy (Fig. 2). Because the combination of
deoxyglucose and Bcl-2 antagonist induces rapid apoptosis
through protein-effector activation of mitochondria, it leaves
little room for interference by highly active mutagenic programs of a cancer cell. Cancer cells resistant to 2DG-ABT
combination therapies are either cancer cells in chronic phase,
cells defective in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, or cells
expressing P-glycoprotein, which can exclude ABT from entering cancer cells.
Our tissue culture studies and cancer-bearing mice showed
that the 2DG-ABT combination induced apoptosis in a variety
of cell lines. The combination therapy effectively treated
difﬁcult-to-treat cancer cells xenografted onto nude mice
(5). We are now trying to initiate a clinical trial for the
combination. Because both deoxyglucose and ABT-263 are

B, brain cells have higher glucose uptake. However, ABT-263 is prevented from entering the brain by the blood–brain barrier. C, in cancer cells, 2DG
is carried across the plasma membrane by the active glucose transporter (Glu Transp). It activates multiple signal transduction cascades, possibly
phosphorylating Mcl-1/Bak, resulting in the dissociation of the Bak-Mcl-1 complex. ABT-263/737 (ABT) is membrane permeable, crosses the plasma
membrane and binds to Bcl-xL, causing dissociation of the Bak-Bcl-xL complex, freeing Bak. Bak oligomerizes, creating pores on the mitochondrial outer
membrane through which cytochrome c is released, crossing the point of no return. Cytochrome c triggers assembly of death-executioner apoptosomes,
causing cell death. The model is a simpliﬁed version of the one found in the work of Yamaguchi and colleagues (5). Note that deoxyglucose also triggers
a PI3K-mTOR-AKT prosurvival pathway by activating IGFR.

already in phase II clinical trials, we do know about the safety of
these agents. The only known side effects of ABT-263 are mild
lymphopenia and reversible thrombopenia. The only concern
we have had in using the combination in a clinical trial was
with deoxyglucose as it could affect brain function, and unlike
mouse or rat brains, the human brain seems much more
delicate and needs more attention. As it turns out, deoxyglucose was used to treat stress-related disorders and schizophrenic patients (23–25), generating enough information to
establish the pharmacologic dose for deoxyglucose.

Physiologic Effects of Deoxyglucose
The amounts of deoxyglucose used in the 2DG-ABT combination in tissue culture cells was 0.4 times that of glucose in
the media. Deoxyglucose primed various cell lines and primary
culture cells for ABT-induced apoptosis not through ATP
insufﬁciency (intracellular ATP levels declined less than 10%
in 8 hours), nor through activating ER stress, but by activating
signal transduction cascades, possibly phosphorylating Mcl-1
and dissociating the Bak-Mcl-1 complex (5).
In our mice experiments, we used 0.5 g/kg deoxyglucose
mixed with the same amount of glucose, applied by peritoneal injection, and observed no obvious harmful effects. In
the past animal studies, 0.25 to 2 g/kg deoxyglucose was
applied by peritoneal injection (see ref. 5 and references

www.aacrjournals.org

within) or 50 to 250 mg/kg of deoxyglucose intravenously
(26) to mice and rats. No harmful effects were observed
either. In one article, 250 mg/kg deoxyglucose actually
reduced the progression of the kindling in a rat kindling
model of temporal lobe epilepsy (27).
In past human clinical studies, 30 to 250 mg/kg deoxyglucose
has been used to treat stress and psychiatric disorders (23–25),
prostate cancer (28), and glioma patients (26, 29, 30). When 40
mg/kg deoxyglucose was administered intravenously to fasting
patients in one study, plasma norepinephrine levels increased
by 80%, raising glucose levels by 44%, suggesting that the
regulatory mechanisms can maintain a normal supply of
glucose in the presence of 40 mg/kg deoxyglucose (25). When
doses exceeding 300 mg/kg were administered in another
study, however, 2 of 6 patients became very restless and could
not complete the treatment regimen, though no signiﬁcant
changes in the vital parameters were observed even at this dose
(29, 30).
With the clinical trials for the combination therapy, the
same ratio of 0.4 glucose/deoxyglucose used for the tissue
culture and mice studies (5) should be maintained. Because
normal blood glucose concentration is usually maintained
between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/L in humans and mice, a concentration of 1.76 mmol/L deoxyglucose in the blood is indicated
for clinical trials of the combination therapy. Thus 40 to
50 mg/kg of deoxyglucose applied orally or intravenously

would be sufﬁcient for most adults, allowing the dose of
deoxyglucose to stay within pharmacologic parameters.

Possible Improvements on the Combination
Therapy
Is deoxyglucose an ideal agent targeting cancer cells? The
answer is no. Deoxyglucose activates insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGFR), which activates the PI3K-mTOR-AKT prosurvival pathway (Fig 2B; see ref. 5 and references within). Thus, in
many cases, having deoxyglucose in the medium actually
reduces the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutics, including the
2DG-ABT combination. Furthermore, the long-term treatment
of deoxyglucose could reduce the cellular concentration of ATP
enough to arrest the cell cycle, making certain genotoxins less
effective. Of course, this negative effect of deoxyglucose is also
an opportunity to improve the 2DG-ABT combination therapy.
The 2DG-ABT combination might actually be enhanced by
adding a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (5). PI3K
inhibitors tend to have adverse side effects. Because a new class
of safer and more effective PI3K inhibitors is now being
developed, it is anticipated that we could add a PI3K inhibitor
to an already very effective 2DG-ABT combination.
The combination of deoxyglucose and ABT successfully
induced apoptosis in many cancer cell lines derived from a
variety of cancer types such as leukemia, hepatocarcinoma,
lung, breast, prostate, and cervical cancer (5). It also induced
apoptosis efﬁciently at many stages of cancer development,
including p53-mutated PTEN-depleted hormone-independent

highly metastasized prostate cancer. Cancer cells resistant to
2DG-ABT combination therapies are either cancer cells in
chronic phase, cells defective in the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis, or cells expressing P-glycoprotein, which can
exclude ABT from entering cancer cells. Unfortunately, more
than 90% of pancreatic cancer cells express P-glycoprotein (31).
The combination treatment of cancer-bearing mice was very
effective against tumor xenograft from hormone-independent
highly metastasized chemoresistant human prostate cancer
cells. Even though the animal studies were efﬁcacious, precautionary measures should be considered when applied to
patients. First, as the combination treatment could cause
lymphopenia and thrombopenia (5), hematopoietic stem cells
should be collected and saved before the combination therapy,
for autologous transplant later. Second, as people taking
metformin for treatment of diabetes are known to have highly
elevated glucose uptake in their bowels (32), the use of metformin might need to be interrupted during the 2DG-ABT
combination therapy. Once we take these and possibly other
precautionary measures, the combination therapy may provide a safe and effective alternative to genotoxin-based cancer
therapies. Thus, we may have found a simple solution to a very
complex problem.
