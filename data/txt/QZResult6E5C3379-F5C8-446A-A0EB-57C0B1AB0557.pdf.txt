BACKGROUND: Refractory germ cell tumor (GCT) patients have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The
identification of novel active agents may be impaired by use of response as the primary endpoint in phase 2 trials.
Improved endpoints could enhance the development of new effective agents. METHODS: The characteristics and outcome of refractory GCT patients enrolled in 7 single-agent phase 2 trials conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed. The study agents were suramin, all-transretinoic acid, topotecan,
pyrazoloacridine, temozolomide, ixabepilone, and sunitinib. The major endpoints evaluated were response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Ninety patients (87 male, 3 female) were treated. The primary tumor site was testis in 65 patients, mediastinum in 17 patients, retroperitoneum in 4 patients, and other in 4
patients. Eighty-six patients had nonseminoma, and 4 patients had pure seminoma. Best responses were 1 (1%) partial
response (ixabepilone), 15 (17%) stable disease, and 74 (82%) progressive disease. Median PFS and OS were 1.0
month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.3) and 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.5-6.4), respectively. Eighty-six of the 90
patients have died. The 12- and 16-week PFS rates were 9% (95% CI, 3-15%) and 6% (95% CI, 1%-11%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with refractory GCT progressed rapidly to these single agents. PFS and OS may be useful
endpoints for designing phase 2 trials testing novel agents in this population. Twelve-week PFS (with comparison to
the 9% benchmark rate reported herein) is the recommended endpoint for phase 2 trial design and median OS (using
4.7 months as the predicted median for the control arm) is suggested for phase 3 trials. Cancer 2012;118:981-6.

INTRODUCTION
Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are considered a model for the treatment of other malignancies because of the high proportion of patients who can achieve cure even in the face of widely metastatic disease. Currently, more than 70% of such
patients are cured with initial cisplatin-based chemotherapy with or without adjunctive surgery.1 Furthermore, 30%-50%
of the remainder can still achieve durable remissions with salvage approaches, including high-dose chemotherapy.1 In contrast, nearly all patients progressing after high-dose chemotherapy (referred to as relapsed/refractory), will ultimately die
from progressive disease. An average of more than 35 years of life is lost when a patient dies from GCT, well over a decade
longer than any other adult malignancy.2

Original Article

Current therapeutic options for patients with
relapsed/refractory GCT are inadequate. Complete
responses range from 0% to 10% with salvage regimens
such as gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin3-5 or oral etoposide,6
and these responses are rarely durable. In addition, salvage
surgery (sometimes referred to as desperation surgery) is
only effective for a small percentage of the rare group of
patients with a solitary site of residual disease.
These realities underscore the need to identify new
active agents against GCT, which has been a major focus
of research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
over the past 2 decades. Whereas historic oncologic drug
development has focused on cytotoxics, most agents in
the current pipeline are considered targeted therapies,
many with cytostatic properties. Such agents may produce
clinical benefit through induction of prolonged periods of
disease stabilization rather than objective responses.
Objective response, the traditional primary endpoint for
phase 2 trials in GCT, may therefore be suboptimal for
assessing these agents, and improved endpoints for assessment of clinical benefit are therefore needed.7 With this
in mind, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics
and outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory GCT
treated at our institution for the purpose of defining progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as
new endpoints for phase 2 and 3 trial design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1990 to 2008, 7 phase 2 trials8-14 with novel single
agents were conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for patients with relapsed/refractory GCT. We
retrospectively reviewed the characteristics and outcome
of refractory GCT patients enrolled in these 7 trials. The
study agents (with year of study initiation) were suramin
(1990), all-transretinoic acid (1991), topotecan (1993),
pyrazoloacridine (1997), temozolomide (2000), ixabepilone (2003), and sunitinib (2007). In general, clinical
evaluation of these agents was supported by prior demonstration of efficacy in vitro or in phase 1 studies.8-14 Eligibility for these protocols varied slightly, but in general,
patients were included only if they were deemed incurable
by standard treatments at the time of the study. Beginning
in 1993, all patients were also required to have already
received, refused, or be deemed ineligible for high-dose
chemotherapy. Ineligibility criteria for high-dose chemotherapy included significant comorbidities, poor renal
function, inability to mobilize stem cells, teratoma with
malignant transformation, and poor performance status.

982

Clinical characteristics were obtained based on a
query of the data recorded and entered into our institution’s central research database at the time the trial was
conducted. Data were cross-checked for accuracy against
those previously reported at the time the trial was published and were supplemented by review of each individual patient’s electronic medical record. This review
included outside correspondence to ensure that therapies
patients had received at outside institutions were not
missed. For patients treated on more than 1 study, baseline characteristics and outcome to the first trial therapy
were used. Survival data was based on review of the electronic medical record and central research database, which
incorporate data from the Cancer Registry and the Social
Security Death Index (updated weekly).
Endpoints/Statistics
The major endpoints evaluated were response, PFS, and
OS. Responses were divided into complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression of disease.
The criteria used to categorize response types varied
between the studies as a result of changes over time.
World Health Organization criteria were used initially
but were later replaced by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. In addition, the frequency of imaging assessments varied, but was at a minimum between
every 4 and 8 weeks. If clinical progression (based on tumor marker rise and deteriorating status/symptoms)
occurred before the planned imaging assessments, the
date the patient was taken off the study was used as the official date of progression. Patients who were removed
from the study due to toxicity were censored but were
recorded as nonprogressors.
PFS was defined as the time from treatment initiation
until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first.
OS was defined as the time from treatment initiation until
death from any cause. PFS and OS curves, as well as 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated according to the
Kaplan-Meier method. A log-rank test was used to determine whether PFS and OS curves differed among groups
defined by each demographic and clinical variable. Twelveweek PFS estimates and 6-month OS estimates with CIs
were estimated using the log-log method were generated.

in more than 1 study. The majority of patients were male
(n ¼ 87) and Caucasian (n ¼ 85), but 3 women and 5
non-Caucasian patients were also included. The median
age was 35 (range, 17-64), and the primary tumor site was
testis in 65 patients, mediastinum in 17 patients, retroperitoneum in 4 patients, and other in 4 patients. Eighty-six
patients had nonseminoma, and 4 had pure seminoma.
Four patients had marker-only disease, and the remaining
86 patients had radiographic evidence of disease with or
without serum tumor marker elevation. The median
number of metastatic sites was 2 (range, 2-5), and the
most commonly involved areas were the lung, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, liver, and other (non-retroperitoneal)
lymph nodes.
All patients had been treated previously with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The median number of prior
lines of chemotherapy was 3 (range, 1-6). Fifty-six (62%)
patients were confirmed to have progressed despite prior
treatment with high-dose chemotherapy. Forty-six (51%)
patients had received paclitaxel as part of 1 or more of
their prior treatment regimens. Many patients who were
not previously treated with paclitaxel were treated in the
early 1990s before the identification of the activity of this
agent against GCT. A full set of patient characteristics is
provided in Table 2.

RESPONSE
Only 1 (1%) of the 90 patients achieved an objective
response, which was a partial response to ixabepilone. Fifteen (17%) patients achieved a best response of stable disease, including 3 patients each on sunitinib, ixabepilone,
topotecan, and temozolomide; 2 patients on all-transretinoic acid; and 1 patient on suramin. The overwhelming
majority of patients (n ¼ 74, 82%) had progressive disease
as their best response, an indication of disease progression

declined by the patient due to toxicity concerns.
PFS and OS
Two patients were taken off the study for toxicity without
documented progression, including 1 patient treated with
suramin and 1 patient treated with ixabepilone. These
patients were censored at the time of study discontinuation. The remaining 88 patients all progressed during
treatment. The median PFS for the entire cohort was 1.0
months (95% CI, 0.8-1.3). At 12 weeks, <9% (95% CI,
3%-15%) of patients were alive and progression-free, and
by 16 weeks, this figure dropped below 6% (95% CI, 1%11%) (Table 3 and Figure 1). The number of patients
who remained progression-free at 12 weeks are listed in
Table 4 according to the investigational agent they
received.

Overall, 86 patients have died, 2 have been lost to
follow-up, and 2 are alive and disease-free. Of these latter
2 patients, 1 was rendered continuously disease-free by
salvage resection of a lung nodule after progression on
sunitinib, now 33þ months from initiation of sunitinib.
The other patient progressed on topotecan before receiving paclitaxel as a single agent and achieving a complete
response to 6 cycles. This patient remains continuously
disease-free since treatment with paclitaxel, now 190þ
months from initiation of topotecan. The median OS was
4.7 months (95% CI, 3.5-6.4) and is illustrated in Figure
2.
Clinical factors (Table 1) were analyzed for an association with an adverse outcome. Elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) level was the only variable that
predicted statistically significant prolonged OS; 25%
(95% CI, 13-38) of patients with elevated LDH levels
achieved 6-month OS versus 57% (95% CI, 41-70) of
those with normal LDH levels. For PFS, an elevated LDH
level (12-week PFS, 4% vs 13%; P ¼ .012) and a human
chorionic gonadotropin level 1000 mIU/mL (12-week

PFS, 0% vs 10%; P ¼ .026) both correlated with adverse
outcome, whereas the presence of unusual sites of metastases (spleen, small intestine, esophagus, skin, heart) was
associated with a higher likelihood of achieving 12-week
PFS (24% vs 5%; P ¼ .022). A trend toward inferior 12week PFS (P ¼ .06) and 6-month OS (P ¼ .07) was also
observed for patients with Karnofsky performance status of
70% versus 80%. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein level and
prior treatments received were not prognostic for OS or
PFS.

DISCUSSION
Current treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory GCT include palliative single agents and combinations, salvage surgical resection, and palliative radiation
therapy to osseous or central nervous system metastases.
However, these options are inadequate, with nearly all
patients destined to die from progressive disease. Furthermore, relapsed/refractory GCT patients are typically
young adult men in the prime of their lives, and their
deaths are responsible for the greatest average number of
life years lost of any malignancy.2
Therefore, there is a need to identify and develop
new active agents against GCT. However, there are several
barriers to achieving this goal, including the long time to
complete studies due to the small number of patients seen
at any individual site and a historic lack of international
cooperation in studying the treatment of this patient population. In addition, with the increasing development of
targeted therapies with cytostatic rather than cytotoxic
properties, it is possible that traditional clinical trial endpoints such as objective response are suboptimal.7
Although cytostatic targeted agents could provide significant clinical benefit, including prolongation of survival
through induction of durable periods of disease stabilization, they would be deemed ineffective if objective
responses were used to assess activity. Therefore, novel
endpoints are needed for a phase 2 trial design in this population to prevent premature rejection of such agents. We
hypothesized that PFS and OS represent suitable endpoints for the study of novel agents in patients with
relapsed/refractory GCT.
The incorporation of new endpoints into phase 2
trials depends on reliable historical data. For example, in
Simon’s 2-stage design15 for single-arm phase 2 trials,
both uninteresting (null hypothesis, P0) and interesting
(alternative hypothesis, P1) levels of activity must be chosen. The specific rates selected for the null and alternative
Cancer

hypotheses are a critical part of trial design, directly affecting whether a drug is deemed promising for further study
as well as the sample size and duration of the trial. Thus,
to devise a trial for patients with relapsed/refractory GCT
with PFS or OS as the primary endpoint, historical data
on PFS and OS in a similar patient population is necessary, in particular when defining the null hypothesis.
In this study, we reviewed the characteristics and
outcomes of 90 patients with relapsed/refractory GCT
treated on 7 negative phase 2 trials at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center between 1990 and 2008. All 7
agents were declared ineffective; therefore, this population
represents a good historical control group for which future
studies can be based. Our primary observation is that
patients with relapsed/refractory GCT are very unlikely to
achieve prolonged PFS (>12 weeks) in the absence of
treatment with an effective therapy. This is in contrast to
other malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma or melanoma, where prolonged periods of stable disease can be
observed in some patients not receiving any form of active
therapy. We identified a median PFS of only 1 month in
this population and demonstrated that <9% and <6% of
patients remain progression-free after 12 and 16 weeks,
respectively, with an overall median survival of only 4.7
months. We also identified elevated LDH level as the sole
factor prognostic for both decreased PFS and OS in this
patient population.
These data are well-suited for application to the
design of phase 2 trials in patients with relapsed/refractory
GCT. For example, based on our data, a Simon’s 2-stage
design could use 12-week PFS as its primary endpoint with
a cutoff value of 10% as the uninteresting outcome (P0)
and 25% as warranting further study (P1). With an alpha
of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20, a trial according to Simon’s optimum 2-stage design15 would accrue 18 patients in the
first stage with a stopping rule to close the study early unless
2 or more patients remained progression-free at 12 weeks..
If 3 of the initial 18 patients achieved at least 12-week
PFS, the trial would expand to a total of 43 patients and
the agent deemed worthy of further study if 8/43 (19%)
patients were alive and progression-free at 12 weeks.15
It might be argued that the low rate of 12-week PFS
proposed as the historical comparator for future phase 2
trials might lead to false acceptance of an inactive drug for
larger study based on chance enrollment of a favorable
population. However, the universal poor outcomes of the
90 patients described herein—despite heterogeneous clinical factors and treatment with multiple different agents
over nearly 20 years—suggest that this is unlikely.

985

Original Article

Furthermore, an analysis of various clinical factors for
association with a more favorable or adverse outcome
among this group revealed a very limited potential to discriminate patients. As mentioned above, only elevated
LDH was prognostic for both PFS and OS. This is in
agreement with another retrospective analysis of 54 GCT
patients who underwent systemic treatment after progression to high-dose chemotherapy in which no clinical factor could be identified as prognostic for survival.16
Simon’s 2-stage design is particularly advantageous to
trials conducted in rare disease states such as relapsed/refractory GCT, where patient accrual can be challenging.
The early stopping rule for inefficacy allows investigators to
quickly close a trial of an inactive agent and move on to a
new study that may hold more promise. More widespread
adoption of this strategy could therefore improve the efficiency of trial conduct in this setting and expedite the development of novel active agents for GCT. Similarly, the
early stopping rule limits the number of patients exposed
to agents unlikely to offer therapeutic benefit, allowing
patients to pursue more worthwhile treatments, and potentially enhancing accrual to other more promising trials.
In conclusion, these data illustrate the rapid progression that nearly all patients with relapsed/refractory GCT
experience when treated with ineffective drugs and indicate that when prolonged stable disease (12 weeks) is
achieved, it is likely to be a manifestation of effective drug
therapy. Therefore, we recommend that 12-week PFS
(with comparison with the 9% benchmark rate reported
herein) be used as the primary endpoint for future phase 2
clinical trial design in this population. This is particularly
important for the study of agents with cytostatic antitumor properties to avoid the inappropriate dismissal of
potentially beneficial novel therapeutics. Similarly, these
data support using OS as the primary endpoint for phase
3 trials in this population, with a median survival of
approximately 5 months expected for the control arm.
