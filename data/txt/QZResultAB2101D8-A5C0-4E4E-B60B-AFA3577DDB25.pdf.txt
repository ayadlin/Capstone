Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells feature increased de novo lipogenesis. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1
(SREBP1), when presented in its mature form (mSREBP1), enhances lipogenesis through
increasing transcription of several of its target genes. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, are master regulators of cellular survival, growth and
metabolism. A role for mTORC1 in the regulation of SREBP1 activity has been suggested;
however the connection between mTORC2 and SREBP1 has not been clearly established and
hence is the focus of this study. mTOR kinase inhibitors (e.g., INK128), which inhibit both
mTORC1 and mTORC2, decreased mSREBP1 levels in various cancer cell lines. Knockdown of
rictor, but not raptor, also decreased mSREBP1. Consistently, reduced mSREBP1 levels were
detected in cells deficient in rictor or Sin1 compared to parent or rictor-deficient cells with reexpression of ectopic rictor. Hence it is mTORC2 inhibition that causes mSREBP1 reduction. As a
result, expression of the mSREBP1 target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase
was suppressed, accompanied with suppressed lipogenesis in cells exposed to INK128. Moreover,
mSREBP1 stability was reduced in cells treated with INK128 or rictor knockdown. Inhibition of
proteasome, GSK3 or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7, prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by
mTORC2 inhibition. Thus mTORC2 inhibition clearly facilitates GSK3-dependent, FBXW7mediated mSREBP1 degradation, leading to mSREBP1 reduction. Accordingly, we conclude that
mTORC2 positively regulates mSREBP1 stability and lipogenesis. Our findings reveal a novel
biological function of mTORC2 in the regulation of lipogenesis and warrant further study in this
direction.

Introduction
1

It has been shown that neoplastic tissues and tumor cells are able to synthesize lipid .
Consistently, the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a
family of master regulators of lipogenesis, and several SREBP target genes such as acetyl
coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and low density lipoprotein
2 3
receptor are elevated in tumor cells , . Accordingly, targeting SREBPs and lipogenesis in
4 7
cancer cells inhibits the growth and survival of cancer cells – . Hence SREBPs and
lipogenesis have emerged as potential cancer therapeutic targets.

Author Manuscript

There are three mammalian SREBP isoforms (SREBP1a, SREBP1c, and SREBP2) encoded
by two genes, SREBF1 and SREBF2. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are generated by alternative
splicing and vary in their expression levels across different tissues, with SREBP1a being the
most abundant isoform in most cultured cell lines. These isoforms have distinct, but
overlapping functions in the regulation of lipogenesis. SREBP1 mainly regulates fatty acid,
phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis, while SREBP2 primarily controls cholesterol
2 8
synthesis via positive regulation of the expression of cholesterol-synthesis genes , .

Author Manuscript

SREBP1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is attached to the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum, where it is associated with the SREBP-cleavage activating protein
(SCAP). Following cleavage in the Golgi, the released mature form of the N-terminal
protein (mSREBP1), which contains the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation
domains, translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription by binding to the sterol
3 8
response element (SRE) of their target genes , . Regulation of SREBP1 levels at
transcriptional, post-transcriptional or post translational level (i.e., gene expression, protein
maturation or protein stability) can cause a change in lipid homeostasis. It is known that
sterols inhibit the cleavage of the precursor SREBP1 and the mSREBP1 is rapidly
catabolized, primarily due to GSK3-dependent and FBXW7-mediated protein
ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation, thereby resulting in suppressed
8 9
transcription , .

Author Manuscript

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates a variety of biological functions
essential for maintaining cancer cell survival and growth by forming two complexes through
direct interaction with different partner proteins: raptor (mTOR complex 1; mTORC1) and
rictor (mTOR complex 2; mTORC2). mTORC1 is well known to regulate many key cellular
processes including cell growth and metabolism primarily via regulating cap-dependent
protein translation initiation. However less is known about the biological functions of
10 11
mTORC2 except for acting as an Akt S473 kinase and regulating cell skeleton , . A few
studies have implicated the role of mTORC1 in positive regulation of SREBP activity at
multiple levels including gene expression, protein processing and nuclear
12 19
translocation – . However, the involvement of mTORC2 in the regulation of SREBPs and
lipid metabolism has not been well studied. Two recent reports using hepatic rictor-knockout
mice suggest that mTORC2 may positively regulate hepatic SREBPs levels and lipogenesis
20 21
without defining the underlying mechanisms , .

Our recent studies have shown that mTORC2 positively regulates the stability of cyclin D1
by suppressing GSK3-dependent and SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated protein
22
degradation . Given that mSREBP1 undergoes GSK3/FBXW7-dependent
23 25
degradation – , we hypothesized that mTORC2 might positively regulate lipogenesis via
stabilizing mSREBP1 by suppressing GSK3/FBXW7-mediated degradation. In this report,
we have indeed demonstrated that mSREBP1 is a key cellular target of mTORC2. mTORC2
stabilizes mSREBP1 through suppressing GSK3-dependent and FBXW7-mediated protein
degradation and hence positively regulates lipogenesis. Accordingly, inhibition of mTORC2
(e.g., with an mTOR kinase inhibitor) triggers mSREBP1 degradation, leading to suppressed
transcription of its target genes and lipogenesis. Hence, our findings provide the first
evidence to connect the mTORC2 to regulation of mSREBP1 and lipid metabolism in cancer
as well other cells, revealing a novel biological function of the mTORC2.

Results
mTOR kinase inhibitors decrease mSREBP1 levels in cancer cells

Author Manuscript

We treated 8 different types of cancer cell lines with different concentrations of the mTOR
kinase inhibitor, INK128, for 8 h and then prepared whole-cell protein lysates for Western
blotting to detect SREBP1 and other proteins. In every tested cell line treated with 20 nM
and 100 nM INK128, we observed concentration-dependent reduction of mSREBP1 with
minimal or almost no effect on the levels of precursor SREBP1. In parallel, we detected
decreased levels of p-Akt and p-S6 (Fig. 1A), indicating effective suppression of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling by INK128 under the tested conditions. Reduction of
mSREBP1 by INK128 occurred at 4 h and was sustained up to 24 h in a fashion similar to
the suppression of Akt and S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Hence it is clear that INK128
effectively decreases mSREBP1 levels, while suppressing both mTORC1 and mTORC2
signaling. We repeated this observation with another mTOR kinase inhibitor, AZD8055. In
comparison, rapamycin decreased mSREBP1 levels in H157 and HCT116 cells, but not in
H1299 cells (Fig. 1C).
Genetic suppression of rictor and Sin1, but not raptor expression, decreases mSREBP1
levels

Author Manuscript

To determine the involvement of mTORCs in the positive regulation of mSREBP1 levels, we
compared the effects of knockdown of rictor and raptor on mSREBP1 levels. We detected
reduced levels of mSREBP1 in A549-shRictor cells, in which rictor was stably silenced, but
not in A549-shRaptor cells with stable knock down of raptor (Fig. 2A). In agreement,
transient knockdown of rictor, but not raptor, with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
transfection reduced mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we detected reduced levels of
mSREBP1 in rictor knockout (KO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in comparison
with wild-type (WT) and rictor-KO-rictor MEFs, in which rictor is re-expressed (Fig. 2C),
indicating that rictor deficiency reduces mSREBP1 levels and rictor re-expression can rescue
mSREBP1 reduction. Consistently, knockout of Sin1, another essential component of
mTORC2, also decreased mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results robustly
show an mTORC2-dependent positive regulation of mSREBP1 levels. Under the tested
conditions (e.g., knockdown or knockout of rictor or knockout of Sin1), we observed

minimal reduction of precursor SREBP1 levels, indicating that mTORC2 primarily regulates
mSREBP1 levels.
Inhibition of mTORC2 destabilizes mSREBP1 protein through promoting its proteasomal
degradation

Author Manuscript

We next determined the underlying mechanism by which mTORC2 inhibition decreases
SREBP1 levels. Given that mSREBP1 is known to be an unstable protein regulated by
24 25
degradation , , we compared the effects of INK126 on mSREBP1 levels in the absence
and presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. We detected mSREBP1 reduction in both
H157 and H1299 cells exposed to INK128. The presence of MG132 not only increased the
basal levels of mSREBP1, but also prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by INK128 (Fig.
3A), suggesting that INK128 decreased mSREBP1 levels through proteasome-mediated
degradation. Moreover, we compared the stabilities of mSREBP1 protein between DMSO
and INK128-treated cells and found that mSREBP1 protein levels were reduced much more
rapidly in INK128-treated cells than in DMSO-treated cells, demonstrating that INK128
destabilizes mSREBP1 protein (Fig. 3B). We also detected faster reduction of mSREBP1
protein in A549-shRictor cells than in A549-pLKO.1 and shRaptor cells (Fig. 3C),
indicating that knockdown of rictor, but not raptor, facilitates mSREBP1 degradation.
Consistently, mSREBP1 protein in rictor-KO MEFs was degraded more rapidly than that in
WT MEFs (Fig. 3D), further supporting the notion that mTORC2 is associated with positive
regulation of mSREBP1 stability. Taking these data together, it is obvious that inhibition of
mTORC2 with either INK128 or genetic rictor depletion initiates proteasomal degradation
of mSREBP1.
INK128 induces mSREBP1 reduction in part through a GSK3-dependent mechanism

Since GSK3 is known to be involved in mSREBP1 degradation , , we next determined
whether GSK3 is involved in mSREBP1 degradation induced by mTORC2 inhibition.
INK128 decreased the levels of mSREBP1 in the absence of the GSK3 inhibitor
CHIR99021 or SB216763 in both H157 and H1299 cells. The presence of CHIR99021 or
SB216763 increased basal levels of mSREBP1 and partially rescued mSREBP1 reduction
caused by INK128 (Fig. 4A). In agreement, genetic inhibition of GSK3 via siRNA-mediated
gene knockdown also increased basal levels of mSREBP1 and in part prevented mSREBP1
reduction induced by INK128 in these cell lines (Fig. 4B). These data hence suggest that
INK128 induces mSREBP1 reduction or degradation at least in part through a GSK3dependent mechanism.
mTORC2 inhibition induces FBXW7-mediated mSREBP1 degradation

Author Manuscript

It has been suggested that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7, mediates GSK3-dependent
23 25
mSREBP1 degradation , . We then investigated whether FBXW7 is involved in
mTORC2 inhibition-induced mSREBP1 degradation. We first studied the effect of FBXW7
silencing in H1299 cells on INK128-induced mSREBP1 reduction and found that INK128
decreased mSREBP1 levels in control siRNA- and non-transfected cells, but not in cells
transfected with FBXW7 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we noticed that FBXW7 knockdown
substantially elevated basal levels of mSREBP1 (Fig. 5A). The knockdown efficiency of
FBXW7 was confirmed with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (Fig. 5B) due to lack of a

specific FBXW7 antibody suitable for use in Western blotting analysis. In agreement, both
INK128 and AZD8055 decreased mSREBP1 levels in HCT116 parental cells, but not in
HCT116 cells deficient in FBXW7 (FBXW7-KO) (Fig. 5C). Again we observed elevated
basal levels of mSREBP1 in HCT116/FBXW7-KO cells (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we examined
the effect of FBXW7 deficiency on rictor knockdown-induced reduction of mSREBP1 and
found that rictor knockdown decreased mSREBP1 levels in HCT116 parental cells, but not
in FBXW7-KO HCT116 cells (Fig. 5D). These data together provide strong support for the
involvement of FBXW7 in mediating mSREBP1 degradation induced by mTORC2
inhibition.
mTORC2 inhibition induces mSREBP1 degradation independent of Akt inhibition

Author Manuscript

Considering that mTORC2 functions as an Akt S473 kinase, which suppresses GSK3
activity through phosphorylation, we further studied whether Akt inhibition is involved in
mediating mSREBP1 degradation triggered by mTORC2 inhibition. To this end, we
compared the effects of INK128 with other PI3K (BKM120) and Akt (API-1, MK2206 and
perifosine) inhibitors on altering mSREBP1 levels. As presented in Fig. 6A, INK128
decreased mSREBP1 levels in every tested cell line as we demonstrated above. Under the
tested conditions, INK128 reduced the levels of p-Akt and p-PRAS40, indicating that it
effectively inhibits Akt signaling. BKM120 reduced mSREBP1 levels in H157 and A549
cells, but not in H1299 cells. However, it suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and
PRAS40 in H157 and H1299 cells, indicating that it inhibits Akt signaling only in H157 and
H1299 cells. AP-1 weakly suppressed Akt and PRAS40 phosphorylation in the tested cell
lines accompanied with no (A549) or even increased (H157 and H1299) effect on mSREBP1
levels. Both MK2206 and perifosine effectively suppressed Akt and PRAS40
phosphorylation in all the tested cell lines as INK128 did, but decreased mSREBP1 levels
only in H157 cells. Rather, we observed increased mSREBP1 in A549 and H1299 cells
exposed to MK2206. Interestingly, we found that both INK128 and BKM120 had no effects
on decreasing p-GSK3 levels in any of the tested cell lines, whereas AP-1, MK2206 and
perifosine decreased p-GSK3 levels in H157 cells, but not in A549 and H1299 cells,
indicating that suppression of Akt does not necessarily lead to inhibition of GSK3
phosphorylation.
Moreover, we compared the effects of rictor and Akt knockdown on mSREPB levels and
found that both Akt II (specifically for Akt1) or Akt I (specifically for Akt1 and Akt2)
siRNA knockdown had limited effect on decreasing mSREBP1 levels in comparison with
rictor knockdown, which substantially reduced mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 6B). Hence it is clear
that Akt has limited effect on the regulation of mSREBP levels in our tested cancer cells.

Inhibition of mTORC2 suppresses the expression of SREBP1 target genes and lipogenesis
Finally, we determined the impact of mSREBP1 degradation induced by mTORC2
inhibition on the expression of SREBP1 target genes and on lipogenesis. We found that
INK128 treatment effectively decreased the levels of both ACC and FASN, two well-known
SREBP1-regulated proteins, in the tested cancer cell lines in both dose-and time-dependent
manners (Figs. 7A and B). We also detected reduced levels of both ACC and FASN in
MEFS deficient in either rictor (rictor-KO) or Sin 1(Sin1-KO). When rictor was re-

introduced into rictor-KO MEFs, both ACC and FASN levels were restored back to normal
levels (Fig. 7C). Moreover, we detected reduced levels of FASN and ACACA (encoding
ACC) gene expression at the mRNA level in INK128-treated cancer cells (Fig. 7D),
indicating that INK128 treatment suppresses transcription of SREBP1 target genes.
Collectively, we conclude that inhibition of mTORC2 suppresses the expression of SREBP1
target genes at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we examined the effect of
INK128 on the lipogenesis of cancer cells. With red oil O staining, we detected far fewer
cells positive for lipid droplets in INK128-treated H1299 cells than in DMSO-treated cells
(Fig. 7E), suggesting that INK128 significantly inhibits the formation of lipid droplets or
lipogenesis.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In agreement with recent finding from two studies using hepatic rictor-deficient mice
20 21
showing that mTORC2 is required for hepatic SREBP1 activation and lipogenesis , , the
current study using both pharmacological and genetic approaches has demonstrated that
mTORC2 plays an essential role in the positive regulation of SREBP1 activation and
lipogenesis in mammalian cells including human cancer cells. Our conclusions are primarily
based on the following findings: 1) mTOR kinase inhibitors that inhibit both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 strongly decreased levels of mSREBP1 with minimal effect on precursor SREBP1
levels in various types of cancer cells (Fig. 1); 2) knockdown of rictor, but not raptor, in
different cancer cell lines substantially decreased mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 2); 3) both rictorKO and Sin1-KO MEFS exhibited reduced levels of mSREBP1 in comparison with wildtype MEFs and re-expression of rictor in rictor-KO MEFs restored mSREBP1 levels (Fig.
2); and 4) inhibition of mTORC2 with both mTOR kinase inhibitors and deficiency with
rictor or Sin1 suppressed the expression of ACC and FASN, which are encoded by two wellknown SREBP1 target genes, and reduced lipid droplet formation (Fig. 7). Hence, it is clear
that, in addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 also plays a critical role in promoting SREBP1
activation and lipogenesis.
Rapamycin is generally thought to be weak or inactive against mTORC2. In this study, we
found that rapamycin also decreased mSREBP1 levels, as did INK128 or AZD6055, in some
cancer cell lines such as H157 and HCT116. We recently reported that acute or short-term
treatment of certain cancer cell lines (e.g., H157) with rapamycin disrupted the assembly of
not only mTORC1, but also mTOCR2, despite increasing Akt phosphorylation,
demonstrating that rapamycin inhibits mTORC2 in addition to mTORC1 in at least some
26
cancer cell lines . Therefore, it is not surprising to see mSREBP1 reduction induced by
rapamycin in some cell lines.

Author Manuscript

The current study has resulted in some important findings towards defining the mechanism
by which mTORC2 positively regulates SREBP1 activation. We have shown that inhibition
of mTORC2 triggers proteasomal degradation of mSREBP1, as demonstrated by the
decreased stability of mSREBP1 upon INK128 treatment, rictor knockdown and rictor
knockout and the rescue of INK128-induced mSREBP2 reduction by proteasomal inhibition
with MG132 (Fig. 3). Moreover, we have further shown that mTORC2 inhibition-induced
mSREBP1 degradation is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 and is at least in part

dependent on GSK3, since inhibition of GSK3 with both chemical inhibitors and genetic
knockdown in part rescued INK128-induced mSREBP1 reduction (Fig. 4) and knockdown
or knockout of FBXW prevented mSREBP1 reduction induced by INK128 or rictor
knockdown (Fig. 5). Hence, we conclude that mTORC2 activates SREBP1 by stabilizing
mSREBP1 through suppressing its GSK3-dependent and FBXW7-mediated degradation. We
noted that inhibition of GSK3 with either chemical inhibitors or gene knockdown only in
part rescued the INK128-induced decrease in mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 4). Whether this
implies an incomplete inhibition of GSK3 activity or that an additional kinase is involved in
priming phosphorylation of mSREBP1 for FBXW7-mediated degradation needs further
investigation.

Author Manuscript

GSK3 is known to be inactivated by Akt through phosphorylation. Given that mTORC2
functions as an Akt S473 kinase, it is reasonable to question the involvement of Akt in
mTORC2-dependent stabilization of mSREBP1. Previous studies have generated conflicting
results regarding the involvement of Akt in regulation of mTORC2-dependent lipogenesis:
one study found that constitutive Akt activation in mTORC2-deficient hepatocytes restored
20
lipogenesis suppressed by mTORC2 deficiency , while another observed that enforced Akt
activation failed to activate lipogenesis in the absence of mTORC2 or in liver specific rictor21
KO mice . In both studies, the involvement of Akt in mTORC2 activation of SREBP1 was
not investigated. In our study, we found that inhibition of Akt with different inhibitors (e.g.,
PI3K and Akt inhibitor) did not mimic the ability of INK128 to decrease mSREBP1 levels
across the different tested cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of Akt also did not mimic the
effect of rictor knockdown in decreasing mSREBP1 levels (Fig. 6). Therefore, we favor a
model in which mTORC2 positively regulates mSREBP stability independent of Akt.

Author Manuscript

It has been shown that mTORC2 does not affect GSK3 activity although it directly activates
Akt, since Sin1 knockout induced suppression of mTORC2, which abolished Akt S473
27
phosphorylation without affecting GSK3 phosphorylation . In our previous study, we
showed that different mTOR kinase inhibitors, at the typical tested concentration ranges
(e.g., 100 nM), suppressed Akt S473 phosphorylation without inhibiting GSK3
22
phosphorylation . Consistently, another study also reported that AZD8055 did not suppress
28
GSK3 phosphorylation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells . These data indicate that inhibition of
mTORC2 does not necessarily lead to GSK3 activation. In our current study, we did not see
INK128 suppression of GSK3 phosphorylation either, although it potently inhibited Akt
S473 phosphorylation and decreased mSREBP1 levels. Therefore, we believe that mTORC2
inhibition-induced GSK3-dependent mSREBP1 degradation is unlikely to be secondary to
Akt inhibition. Considering the importance of constitutive GSK3 activity in maintaining the
biological activities of mTOR kinase inhibitors including the induction of cyclin D1 and
22
Mcl-1 degradation (our unpublished data) and growth inhibition , we suggest that the
presence of constitutive GSK3 activity may be sufficient for mSREBP1 to undergo FBXW7mediated degradation upon mTORC2 inhibition. We are currently investigating the
mechanism(s) by which mTORC2 negatively regulates GSK3-dependent and FBXW7mediated protein degradation.
An increased rate of lipid synthesis or lipogenesis in cancerous tissues has long been

recognized as an important aspect of the rewired metabolism of transformed cells .

Accordingly, targeting SREBPs and lipogenesis in cancer cells inhibits their growth and

survival – . Some agents have been shown to exert their anticancer activity via suppression
7 29 31
of SREBPs and lipogenesis , – . mTOR kinase inhibitors have been recently developed
32
as potential anticancer agents and are currently tested in clinical trials . Therefore it is
likely that the anticancer activity of the mTOR kinase inhibitors is attributed at least in part
to their ability to inhibit SREBP1 activity and lipogenesis. In addition to cancer, other
diseases such as coronary artery disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, type II
diabetes, immunity disorders and neuronal diseases are also associated with altered SREBPs
8 14 33
expression and lipid homeostasis , , . Thus, the potential application of mTOR kinase
inhibitors in the treatment of these diseases should also be considered and investigated.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our current study has demonstrated that mTORC2 positively regulates SREBP1
activity and lipogenesis through suppressing GSK3-dependent and FBXW7-mediated
degradation of mSREBP1 and subsequent expression of SREBP1 target genes involved in
regulation of lipogenesis, hence connecting mTORC2 to the positive regulation of lipid
metabolism, a novel biological function of mTORC2. Accordingly, mTOR, particularly
mTORC2, inhibitors may have potential application in the treatment of certain diseases
associated with abnormal lipid metabolism such as cancer, diabetes and obesity.

protein lysates were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM sodium
chloride, 2.0% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1
mM EDTA and 1% Triton X-100). Western blot analysis was performed as described
22
previously .
Gene knockdown by siRNA
The non-silencing (control), rictor, raptor, GSK3α/β and FBXW7 siRNAs were the same as
22
described previously . Akt siRNA I (#6211) that targets Akt1 and Akt2 and siRNA II
(#6510) that targets Akt1 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Transfection
of these siRNA duplexes was conducted in 6-well plates using the Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s manual.

Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol regents. 2 μg of total RNA was then used as
templates for the reverse transcription reaction using the Easy Transcript kit (abm;
Richmond, BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for detection
22
of FBXW7 was the same as described previously . Detection of SREBP1 target genes
including FASN and ACACA was conducted by qPCR with the iTaq Universal SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Life Technologies/Applied
Biosystems; Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers for
these genes are as follows: FASN 5′-AACTCCAAGGACACAGTCACCAT-3′ (forward) and
5′-CAGCTGCTCCACGAACTCAA-3′ (reverse); ACACA 5′GGATGGGCGGAATGGTCTCTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′GCCAGCCTGTCGTCCTCAATGTC-3′ (reverse); and Actin 5′CTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′
(reverse).
