Abstract
Activating mutations of K-ras are the most common oncogenic alterations found in lung cancer. Unfortunately, attempts
to target K-ras–mutant lung tumors have thus far failed, clearly
indicating the need for new approaches in patients with this
molecular proﬁle. We have previously shown NF-kB activation,
release of IL6, and activation of its responsive transcription
factor STAT3 in K-ras–mutant lung tumors, which was further
ampliﬁed by the tumor-enhancing effect of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)-type airway inﬂammation. These
ﬁndings suggest an essential role for this inﬂammatory pathway
in K-ras–mutant lung tumorigenesis and its enhancement by
COPD. Therefore, here we blocked IL6 using a monoclonal
anti-IL6 antibody in a K-ras–mutant mouse model of lung
cancer in the absence or presence of COPD-type airway inﬂammation. IL6 blockade signiﬁcantly inhibited lung cancer pro-

motion, tumor cell–intrinsic STAT3 activation, tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis markers. Moreover, IL6 inhibition
reduced expression of protumor type 2 molecules (arginase 1,
Fizz 1, Mgl, and IDO), number of M2-type macrophages and
granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and protumor
T-regulatory/Th17 cell responses. This was accompanied by
increased expression of antitumor type 1 molecule (Nos2),
and antitumor Th1/CD8 T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that IL6 blockade not only has direct intrinsic inhibitory
effect on tumor cells, but also reeducates the lung microenvironment toward an antitumor phenotype by altering
the relative proportion between protumor and antitumor
immune cells. This information introduces IL6 as a potential
druggable target for prevention and treatment of K-ras–mutant
lung tumors. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3189–99. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

of lung cancer patients, are one of the most prevalent genetic
alterations associated with tobacco exposure (1). Unfortunately, pharmacologic attempts to develop targeted therapies to
interfere with K-ras activity have shown limited success to
date; therefore, alternative strategies are needed to inhibit
this oncogenic signaling pathway and bring clinical beneﬁts
to lung cancer patients with mutant K-ras. In addition, several
studies have found that smokers with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of lung
cancer (3- to 10-fold) compared to smokers with comparable
cigarette exposure but without COPD (3–5). COPD is a chronic
inﬂammatory disease of the lung, which is present in 40% to
70% of lung cancer patients (6). Importantly, among smokers
with COPD, even following withdrawal of cigarette smoke,
inﬂammation persists and lung function continues to deteriorate as does the increased risk of lung cancer (7, 8). Furthermore, because of the persistent lung cancer risk among former
smokers, and increased diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer
with the recommended screening method (low-dose CT scan;
ref. 9), strategies targeting pathways that stop the progression
of COPD and early-stage lung cancer to advanced lung cancer
would also be valuable.
We and other groups have demonstrated that K-ras–mutant
lung tumors have intrinsic inﬂammatory characteristics, with
activation of the NF-kB pathway, increased levels of the

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide due to its high incidence and low cure rate (1), and
cigarette smoke is by far the most common cause of it (2).

cytokine IL6, which is transcriptionally regulated by NF-kB,
and activation of the IL6-responsive transcription factor
STAT3 (10–12). This inﬂammatory response was further ampliﬁed by the tumor-enhancing effect of COPD (12, 13). These
data suggest an essential role for IL6 in lung cancer pathogenesis. Importantly, they also introduce IL6 as a potential druggable target for the prevention and treatment of K-ras–mutant
lung cancer.
In this study, using a K-ras–induced lung cancer mouse model,
we demonstrate that K-ras activation drives a protumor immunosuppressive microenvironment with increased type 2 and
reduced type 1 inﬂammatory signatures via IL6 signaling, which
is ampliﬁed in the presence of COPD-type inﬂammation.
Signiﬁcantly, we show that pharmacologic targeting of IL6 suppresses K-ras lung tumorigenesis, and reeducates the lung microenvironment toward an antitumor immune phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Human studies
STAT3 mRNA expression was determined by array analysis
(Illumina v3) of surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas from
150 patients that did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. This cohort
was obtained from the Proﬁling of Resistance patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax
(PROSPECT) study, developed in 2006 at MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, TX; ref. 14). Clinical characteristics of these
patients are presented in Table 1. STAT3 mRNA expression from
these patients was log2 transformed and median expression was
computed. We then dichotomized lung adenocarcinoma patients
based on median STAT3 mRNA expression in the manner previously performed (15). Patients with relatively "low" expression
displayed lower than the median STAT3 levels, whereas patients
with relatively "high" expression exhibited greater than the median STAT3 expression levels.

provided by Dr. Adi Gazdar (University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, Dallas, TX) in 2010, whose lab conﬁrmed their
identity by genotype testing. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine
(Gibco-BRL) at 37 C under 5% CO2. Cisplatin (Teva Pharmaceuticals), and tocilizumab (Roche-Genentech) were obtained
from the MD Anderson Cancer Center Pharmacy. Siltuximab was
kindly provided by Janssen Pharmaceuticals.
MTS assays
Cytotoxicity to cisplatin, tocilizumab, siltuximab, or combinations, was assessed by CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Absorbance was read at 495 nm using Softmax pro
(Molecular Devices). Concentrations resulting in cell growth
inhibition of 50 (IC50) were calculated for cisplatin. For other
treatments, the metabolic state was expressed as a percent of
controls (%CT).
Mouse models
CCSPCre/LSL-K-rasG12D mice (CC-LR) were generated as described previously (12). Brieﬂy, this strain is generated by crossing
mice harboring the LSL-K-rasG12D allele with mice containing Cre
recombinase inserted into the Club cell secretory protein (CCSP)
locus (12). All mice were housed in speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions and handled in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mice were
monitored daily for the evidence of disease or death.
NTHi lysate aerosol exposure
A lysate of nontypeable Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (NTHi) strain 12
was prepared as described previously (12). CC-LR mice were
nebulized with the lysate (2.5 mg/mL in PBS) once a week starting
at 6 weeks of age for 8 weeks. The delivery of the lysate to mice was
made by aerosolizing a thawed aliquot of NTHi placed in an
AeroMist CA-209 nebulizer (CIS-US) driven by 10 L/minute of
room air supplemented with 5% CO2 for 20 minutes.
In vivo IL6 blockade
Six-week-old CC-LR and control mice were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg dose of an anti-IL6 monoclonal (Clone
MP5-20F3, R&D Systems) or IgG1 isotype control (Clone 43414,
R&D Systems) antibodies twice a week for 8 weeks.
Histochemistry
Mice were anesthetized and sacriﬁced by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (Sigma), then the tracheas of euthanized mice were
cannulated with PE-50 tubing and sutured into place. The lungs
were infused with 10% buffered formalin (Sigma) and then
removed and placed in 10% buffered formalin. Tissues then were
embedded in parafﬁn blocks, and sectioned at 5-mm thickness.
The sections on glass slides were dried, then were deparafﬁnized
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The H&E-stained
slides were examined by a pathologist blinded to genotype
and treatment, and the proliferative lesions of the lungs were
evaluated in accordance with the recommendations of the
Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium (16).
Immunostaining
Previously sectioned lung samples on slides were immunohistochemically stained and evaluated for expression of

IL6 Blockade in K-ras–Mutant Lung Cancer

P-STAT3 (Tyr705; 1:250; Cell Signaling Technology), Ki-67
(1:200; Abcam), CD31 (1:50, BD Biosciences), VEGF (1:750;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and MMP-9 (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed
using 10 mmol/L of citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker
for 20 minutes. After quenching endogenous peroxidase with
3% hydrogen peroxide, blocking was performed with nonimmune normal serum. Immunoreactivity for IHC was detected
using biotinylated IgG secondary antibodies speciﬁc for each
primary antibody followed by incubation with ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories), and stained with diaminobenzidine chromogenic substrate. Slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin, followed by dehydration, and mounted with cytoseal
60 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Images were obtained by an
OLYMPUS BX 60 microscope at 4 or 40 magniﬁcation with
Image-Pro Plus, version 4.5.1.22. The numbers of labeled
positive cells for each marker were quantitated as a fraction
of total tumor nuclei per high power ﬁeld (40) in 10 ﬁelds
from 3 to 5 mice of each group. Results were expressed
as percentage of positive cells  SE.
Assessment of lung tumor burden and inﬂammation
Lung surface tumor numbers were counted, and then bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF) was obtained by sequentially instilling and collecting 2 aliquots of 1-mL PBS through a tracheostomy
cannula. The lungs were snap frozen and stored for future RNA
and protein analysis. Total leukocyte count was determined using
a hemocytometer and cell populations were determined by cytocentrifugation followed by Wright–Giemsa (W&G; Sigma) staining. The remaining BALF was centrifuged at 1,250  g for 10
minutes, and supernatants were collected and stored at 80 C for
further analysis.
Cytokines/chemokine measurement
The levels of IL6, IL10, IL17A, CCL5, CXCL1, and TNFa in the
BALF were assessed using the MCYTOMAG-70 K assay (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TGFb was
assayed using the TGFB-64 K-01 (Millipore) assay. Data were
collected using a Luminex 100 (Luminex Corporation). Standard curves were generated using a 5-parameter logistic curveﬁtting equation (StarStation V 2.0; Applied Cytometry Systems). Each sample reading was interpolated from the appropriate standard curve.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from whole lung according to the
TRIzol reagent protocol (Invitrogen) and puriﬁed by E.Z.N.A.
total RNA Kit I (OMEGA). RT-PCR was performed using the
qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences). Quantitative RTPCR was performed according to a standard protocol using genespeciﬁc primers (Supplementary Table S1). SYBR Green reactions
were done using FastMix, Low ROX (Quanta Biosciences) and
products measured on an ABI Viia 7 PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). The expression of individual genes was calculated
and normalized with the DDCt method.
Isolation of lung resident mononuclear cells
Lungs were harvested after perfusion with PBS, then were
inﬂated with 150 m/mL collagenase IV and 20 m/mL DNase1 in
PBS for 25 minutes at 37 C/5% CO2. Single-cell suspensions
were prepared by mechanical dissociation of lung tissue

www.aacrjournals.org

through a 70-mm nylon mesh. Lung cells were suspended in
PBS and layered on lymphocyte separation medium (Lonza).
Cells were centrifuged at room temperature for 20 minutes
at 900  g, and mononuclear cells were harvested from the
gradient interphase.
Flow cytometry and FACS
Cells were stained with ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies using
CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (BM8), CD11c (N418),
Ly-6C (AL-21), Ly-6G (1A8), and I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2) markers
on ice for 30 minutes (17). Cells were analyzed and gated (Supplementary Fig. S1) on an LSRII machine or isolated by FACS
(BD Biosciences). Data were further analyzed by FlowJo.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using two-tailed unpaired Student t test,
and presented as mean  SEM. GraphPad Prism 6 software was
used for analysis. Differences were considered signiﬁcant for P <
0.05. Assessment of disease-free survival was performed using Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis and the Kaplan–Meier
method for estimation of survival probability.

Results
IL6/STAT3 pathway as a potential druggable target for
K-ras–mutant lung tumors
Serum IL6 level in patients with stage I lung cancer is associated
with signiﬁcantly shorter survival and poorer outcome (18, 19).
Here we investigated whether STAT3, the principal IL6-activated
signaling molecule, is predictive of clinical outcome in KRASmutant human lung adenocarcinomas. Although STAT3 expression was not signiﬁcantly different between KRAS mutant (mean,
9.137; median, 9.274) and WT (mean, 9.112; median, 9.352)
subgroups, we found a trend for association of high STAT3 mRNA
expression with poor disease-free survival in all lung adenocarcinomas (HR ¼ 1.56, P ¼ 0.065; Fig. 1A). Further analysis demonstrated that in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, STAT3
mRNA level was a signiﬁcant predictor of poor disease-free
survival (HR ¼ 3.28, P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 1B). As STAT3 mRNA amounts
can reﬂect STAT3 activity due to STAT3 autoregulatory function
(20), these data insinuate that IL6/STAT3 pathway activation
worsens clinical outcomes of patients with KRAS-mutant lung
adenocarcinoma.
These observations prompted us to block IL6 using a pharmacologic approach. We ﬁrst assessed gene expression for IL6,
IL6R, and STAT3 in 39 NSCLC cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia mRNA expression dataset (21). This expression
data was plotted using the pheatmap package in R, where
dendrograms indicate clustering by standard Ward algorithm
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). We then selected (Supplementary
Method S1) a representative panel of cells that expressed IL6
and STAT3 and featured the major histologic subtype and mutational signature found among NSCLC patients (Supplementary
Fig. S2A–S2C). We then tested two FDA-approved mAbs
against IL6 or the IL6 receptor (IL6R), siltuximab and tocilizumab, respectively, in this representative panel of cell lines.
Inhibition of IL6 or IL6R resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of
phosphorylated STAT3, the main IL6-responsive transcription
factor (Supplementary Fig. S2D; Supplementary Method S2).
This indicates that IL6 produced by the cancer cell is functionally
active and acts through the IL6R within cancer cells, and these

IL6/STAT3 pathway as a potential druggable target for K-ras–mutant lung tumors. All adenocarcinomas (N ¼ 152; A) and KRAS-mutant adenocarcinomas
(N ¼ 39; B) from PROSPECT cohort were stratiﬁed on the basis of STAT3 median mRNA expression (high, black; low, gray). Patient subgroups were
then analyzed for differences in disease-free survival using the Kaplan–Meier method for estimation of survival probability and the log-rank test. C and
D, the cell lines were incubated with tocilizumab or siltuximab at different concentrations alone or in combination with the respective IC50 of cisplatin
(Combo) for 48 hours. Data represent means  SEM. (n ¼ 4 independent experiments;  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.005;    , P < 0.001;     , P < 0.0001).

humanized Abs are able to inhibit this process. Surprisingly, IL6
or IL6R blockade alone or in combination with cisplatin, while
having a mild to moderate effect on tumor cell proliferation, did
not show any greater effect than cisplatin alone (Fig. 1C and D).
These results suggest a potential role for tumor microenvironment in vulnerability of tumor to respond to targeting inﬂammatory signals as explored below.
Effects of IL6 blockade on murine K-ras–mutant lung tumors
We observed increased levels of IL6 in a conditional K-ras–
induced lung cancer mouse model (CC-LR) compared with
controls (LR mice), and during tumor progression (Supplementary Fig. S3), which was associated with increased expression of STAT3 mRNA (22), further suggesting an important
role for IL6/STAT3 pathway in K-ras–mutant lung tumorigenesis.
Accordingly, we investigated effects of IL6 blockade in vivo.
Cohorts of 6-week-old CC-LR mice were injected intraperitoneally with a 20 mg/kg dose of monoclonal anti-IL6 rat IgG1 or
IgG1 control antibodies, twice a week, for a period of 8 weeks,
then their lungs and BALFs were collected at the age of 14 weeks.

3192 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

IL6 blockade did not cause any signiﬁcant change in mouse
weight compared with control group. As we previously described, main lung lesions in CC-LR mice are epithelial hyperplasia in
the early stage, and adenomas in the middle and late stages (12).
Lesions that show atypical cytologic features and invasive histologic features are identiﬁed as adenocarcinomas and are present at late stage. Histopathologic analysis of the lungs from antiIL6–treated CC-LR mice revealed fewer and smaller lesions with
lower percentage of adenoma/adenocarcinoma lesions (Supplementary Fig. S4), and lower number of visible macroscopic lung
surface tumors (by 57%) compared with the IgG1-treated control group (Fig. 2A). This was associated with a 46% reduction in
tumor cell proliferation, as measured by Ki-67 expression (Fig.
2B). We also observed a signiﬁcant decrease (by 56%) in STAT3
activation, as judged by tyrosine-P-STAT3 amounts (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, targeting IL6 suppressed angiogenesis in the lungs of
CC-LR mice, as measured by decreased expression of the angiogenesis markers CD31, VEGF, and MMP-9 (Fig. 2D). These data
suggest that IL6 induces proliferative and angiogenic effects on
lung tumors in vivo that might be mediated by STAT3 activation.

Effect of IL6 blockade on K-ras–mutant lung tumor
microenvironment
In solid tumors K-ras mutation induces an inﬂammatory
response (10, 12), which has been linked to NF-kB activation
(11, 23). This tumor-promoting inﬂammation tailors the
tumor microenvironment toward a suppressive state, which is
considered a crucial step for tumor establishment (24); however, IL6 effects on tumor-inﬁltrating immune subsets have
not been fully characterized. Therefore, we analyzed the BALFs
and whole lungs of CC-LR mice with or without IL6 blockade
to determine whether IL6 affected immune cells within the
tumor microenvironment. W&G staining of BALF from CC-LR
mice showed that macrophages represent 93% of total white
blood cells (WBC) found in lung microenvironment in this
model (Fig. 3A). The anti-IL6 treatment signiﬁcantly decreased
the total WBC number and macrophage population, without
major effects on other leukocyte subsets (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometry analysis of BALFs of anti-IL6–treated CC-LR mice further revealed that there was no change in the percentage
of CD45þCD11CþF4/80þ alveolar macrophages compared
with IgG1 control group (Fig. 3B). However, we found a
45% decrease in total macrophage number in agreement with
our W&G ﬁndings (Fig. 3C). We also observed a signiﬁcant
decrease in the expression of the macrophage chemoattractant
CCL2 in the lungs of CC-LR mice treated with anti-IL6 Ab
(Fig. 3D), which may explain the reduction in total macrophage
number observed.
To study phenotypic changes in macrophage population,
we further analyzed the expression of genes related to macrophage polarization in the BALF population from CC-LR mice.

www.aacrjournals.org

We observed a reduction in the expression of macrophage
protumor (type 2) genes including arginase1 (Arg), found in
inﬂammatory zone 1 (FIZZ1), macrophage galactose binding
lectin (Mgl) and mannose receptor C, type 1 (Mrc1) with IL6
blockade (Fig. 3E). We also observed a similar reduction in
the expression of Arg1 and FIZZ1 in the whole lung tissue
from CC-LR mice with IL6 blockade (data not shown). We
observed an even greater reduction when Arg1 level was normalized to macrophage number and to expression of the
hematopoietic-speciﬁc marker CD45 (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Moreover, ELISA analysis of inﬂammatory mediators in
the BALF of CC-LR mice after IL6 inhibition revealed reduction
in CXCL1 expression as well as in the expression of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL10 and TGFb (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that IL6 drives protumor (type 2)
macrophage polarization in K-ras–mutant lung tumors and
suggest that one mechanism by which IL6 blockade suppresses
the tumor progression is by reprograming the lung immune
microenvironment.
We have previously demonstrated that Th17 and potentially
T-regulatory (Treg) cells play a role in K-ras–mutant lung tumorigenesis (13). Here, within the lung CD45þ population, we found
that IL6 blockade decreases the expression of IL17, Tgfb, and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), suggesting a decrease in Th17 and Treg
inﬁltration or differentiation (Fig. 3G). We also detected an increase in Ifng, granzyme B (Gzmb), and T-bet (Tbx21) expression
suggestive of enhanced Th1 differentiation and CD8 T-cell cytotoxic activation (Fig. 3G). Together, our data suggest that targeting
IL6 reformats immune subset inﬁltration and gene expression
patterns in the lung microenvironment toward an antitumor state.

Pharmacologic targeting of IL6 as a therapeutic strategy to
prevent the tumor-promoting effect of COPD on K-ras–induced
lung tumorigenesis
We have previously developed a COPD-like mouse model of
airway inﬂammation by repetitive exposure to a lysate of NTHi, a
common colonizer of the airways in COPD patients (25). We have
shown that this type of airway inﬂammation has a tumor-enhancing effect in CC-LR mice, associated with activation of the NF-kB
pathway and increased levels of IL6 (Supplementary Fig. S6;
refs. 12, 13). COPD patients show high levels of IL6 in their
sputum and there is an inverse correlation between lung function
and IL6 levels in these patients (26, 27). IL6 is also implicated in
inﬂammatory responses in COPD, and its overexpression results

in airspace enlargement and inﬂammation in murine models
(28). Therefore, we studied the effect of IL6 blockade on lung
cancer enhancement by COPD-type inﬂammation.
Six-week-old CC-LR mice were treated with anti-IL6 Ab twice a
week while being exposed to aerosolized NTHi lysate once a
week, for a period of 8 weeks. Histopathologic and macroscopic
analysis of the lungs from CC-LR mice after IL6 blockade and
COPD induction revealed fewer lesions (65% reduction) compared with IgG1-treated control group (Fig. 4A). This was associated with a 42% reduction in tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 4B),
a 63% reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), and
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor angiogenesis, as judged by angiogenesis marker expression (Fig. 4D). These ﬁndings suggest IL6

blockade directly suppresses enhancement of lung cancer by
COPD-type airway inﬂammation via tumor cell–intrinsic effects.
Effect of IL6 blockade on the COPD-associated tumor
microenvironment
W&G staining of the BALF population from NTHi-exposed
CC-LR mice showed that neutrophils comprise 72% of total
WBCs in the IgG1-treated control group, similar to BALF of
COPD patients (29). Surprisingly, IL6 blockade induced an
increase in total WBCs in BALF, including elevated macrophage
numbers without a signiﬁcant change in total neutrophils
(Fig. 5A). To conﬁrm this, we measured expression of Cd45
and Ccl2 in the lungs of CC-LR mice by qRT-PCR and we
observed a signiﬁcant increase in the expression of both markers after anti-IL6 treatment, corroborating our W&G ﬁnding
(Fig. 5B). In addition, we conﬁrmed the increase in the total
macrophage (CD45þF4/80þ) population in BALF by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the macrophage population
showed increased MHCII expression and reduced Ly6C, with
a greater proportion of CD45þF4/80þLy6CMHCIIþ cells
(Fig. 5D). Collectively, these results suggest IL6 blockade
induces macrophage inﬁltration as well as polarization toward
an antitumor M1 phenotype.
Chronic inﬂammation builds an altered microenvironment with recruitment and accumulation of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC). These immature cells show nonspeciﬁc suppressive capabilities and produce Arg1 and IDO
(indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase) that deplete arginine and
tryptophan, key amino acids for T-cell activation (30, 31). In
our COPD model, we found that BALFs from CC-LR mice
exposed to NTHi have an abundant granulocytic MDSC

www.aacrjournals.org

(G-MDSC; CD45þCD11bþLy6Gþ) population, which was
reduced signiﬁcantly upon anti-IL6 treatment (Fig. 5E). To study
qualitative changes in lung MDSCs, we analyzed gene expression within FACS-puriﬁed monocytic (CD45þCD11bþLy6G)
and granulocytic (CD45þCD11bþLy6Gþ) MDSCs from BALF
of CC-LR mice after NTHi exposure. We observed decreased expression of Arg1 in the monocytic population and
decreased expression of Ido in the granulocytic population
upon anti-IL6 treatment, suggesting skewing of these subsets
toward a nonsuppressive phenotype (Fig. 5F). Moreover,
anti-IL6 treatment was associated with a decrease in levels
of CXCL1 and IL17 proteins (Fig. 5G), two mediators involved in recruitment and promotion of MDSCs with suppressive
activity (32).
We also assayed the T-cell differentiation status in the lungs of
NTHi-exposed CC-LR mice, and we found that after IL6 blockade there is an increase in TNFa and CCL5 protein expression
(Fig. 5G), a cytokine and a chemokine related to T-cell activation
and recruitment, respectively (33). We further observed a
decrease in Tgfb and Foxp3 expression within the lung CD45þ
population (Fig. 5H), suggestive of reduced Treg differentiation.
Moreover, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in Gzmb and Tbx21
expression (Fig. 5H), signatures of CD8 and Th1 cytotoxic
programs, respectively. We also observed a decrease in Ccl2
and increase in Nos2 (Fig. 5H) expression suggestive of M1
macrophage polarization similar to what we observed in nonCOPD setting.
Overall, these results further suggest IL6 has a paracrine role
in K-ras–mutant lung cancer, and its blockade shifts the lung
microenvironment toward a nonsuppressive antitumor (type 1)
direction in the presence of COPD as well.

IL6 Blockade in K-ras–Mutant Lung Cancer

lower overall survival (19). Here, we observed that IL6 induces
tumor cell proliferation and orchestrates an immunosuppressive lung microenvironment with type 2 macrophage polarization along with MDSCs recruitment putting IL6 as a potential
druggable target for KRAS-mutant tumors with a novel paracrine effect. Our data is in agreement with a recently described
homeostatic function of IL6 in limiting inﬂammation via
polarizing monocytes to a suppressive M2 state (36), that could
favor tumor immune escape and growth (37).
Strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive state of the
tumor microenvironment by reeducating myeloid cells via targeting cytokines have been applied to other solid tumors (38, 39)
but have not been tested in lung cancer. Targeting of cytokines
such as IL6 is a safe strategy used for treatment of autoimmune
diseases (40). We found that anti-IL6 treatment signiﬁcantly
inhibits K-ras–induced lung tumorigenesis in vivo that is correlated with a shift in the lung microenvironment toward a less
proliferative, less angiogenic, and less suppressive antitumor
myeloid phenotype. Tumor inhibition in response to anti-IL6
Ab treatment was not due to reduced recombination rate as there
was no difference in CCSP expression in anti-IL6 Ab–treated
groups when compared with nontreated groups (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Tan and colleagues have also targeted IL6 using genetic
strategy in an Adenovirus Cre–dependent K-ras mouse model and
found that lack of IL6 interestingly increases tumor initiation
while suppressing tumor growth and increasing survival (41).
This was also observed in a model, which in IL6 was targeted
conditionally in epithelial cells using the same Adenovirus Cre
delivery strategy (42). In our model, IL6 blockade did not increase
tumor initiation. We attribute these differences to the distinct
timing and cell-speciﬁc effects of mutant K-ras induction and IL6
blockade, as well as absence or presence of adenoviral infection.
Interestingly, using commercially available NSCLC cell lines,
while we found a signiﬁcant STAT3 pathway inhibition by siltuximab (mAb against IL6) or tocilizumab (mAb against IL6 cognate
receptor), only a modest effect of these Abs alone or in combination with cisplatin on cell proliferation in vitro was observed.
This is similar to what has been recently described with siltuximab
alone or in combination with erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC
cell lines (43). Thus, our data and the aforementioned study point
to the crucial role of myeloid and other cell populations within
the tumor microenvironment as being important in the tumorinhibitory properties of anti-IL6 Ab.
We have previously shown that COPD-like airway inﬂammation promotes K-ras–induced lung tumorigenesis (12).
Here, we further found that this process was associated with
robust increase in IL6 levels, increased STAT3 activation, and
an ampliﬁed myeloid cell response (M2-type macrophage
polarization along with accumulation of neutrophils and
G-MDSCs). Interestingly, COPD patients with or without lung
cancer show increased MDSC population (44), which is associated with high levels of IL6 in both group. As expected,
treatment with anti-IL6 Ab signiﬁcantly reduced the promoting
effect of COPD-like airway inﬂammation on lung tumor cell
proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. However, IL6 blockade
surprisingly increased the total lung inﬂammatory cell number
in contrast to what we observed in absence of COPD-like
inﬂammation. This observation was largely due to increased
number of lung macrophages with M1 phenotype characterized by high MHC class II expression, which could be related
to increased expression of CCL2. Interestingly, anti-IL6 treat-

www.aacrjournals.org

ment did not increase the absolute number of neutrophils
but signiﬁcantly reduced the number of G-MDSCs thus further pointing to a paracrine effect of IL6 in modulating tumor
microenvironment. This was associated with a decreased
level of myeloid cell–related chemokine and cytokine, CXCL1
and IL17, which we have previously shown to have important
roles in promotion of K-ras–mutant lung cancer by inﬂammation (45, 46).
Phenotypic changes observed in myeloid cells due to anti-IL6
treatment, accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in expression of
metabolic mediators, Arg1 and IDO, two enzymes that deplete Larginine and tryptophan, respectively, which are key amino acids
for T-cell anabolic functions (47). This was associated with a
switch in T-cell response from a protumor Treg/Th17 to an
antitumor Th1/CD8 T-cell response. This is in accordance with
our previous ﬁnding indicating an essential role for Th17 cells in
promotion of K-ras–induced lung tumors, which was dependent
on the presence of MDSCs (13), and reinforces the notion that
myeloid cells are key immune cells in K-ras–mutant lung tumors.
The proliferative, survival, and angiogenic effects of IL6 on
epithelial (tumor) cells are mediated by the STAT3 pathway
activation (48–50). In a previously published study by Qu and
colleagues, upregulation of STAT3 and its target genes were
observed in lung tissues from both smokers and nonsmokers
with COPD (51). We have also found that relatively increased
STAT3 expression is signiﬁcantly associated with worse diseasefree survival in patients with K-ras–mutant lung tumors. This
suggests that aberrant STAT3 expression impacts clinical outcome
among early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients with KRAS
mutations, which can be attributed to cross-talk between KRAS
and STAT3 signaling. We further found that IL6 blockade inhibits
epithelial STAT3 activation and subsequent tumor cell proliferation in our K-ras–mutant mouse, which is in agreement with
recently published data (42, 52). Chronic STAT3 activation could
also inhibit the expression of mediators necessary for immune
activation against tumor cells (53), and contributes to the accumulation of MDSCs with immunosuppressive properties
(54, 55), which we observed in our study as well. Thus, our results
suggest that chronic IL6/STAT3 signals may contribute to both
observed cell intrinsic and immunosuppressive mechanisms of
tumor promotion, which were all signiﬁcantly reduced in our
model after IL6 blockade.
Collectively, our data show that K-ras mutation besides its cellintrinsic proliferative and angiogenic effects, drives an immunosuppressive protumor microenvironment with a M2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization, recruitment of MDSCs, and
increases Treg/Th17 response, which is probably orchestrated by
IL6 in both autocrine and paracrine fashion. To our knowledge,
these are novel functions for IL6 and novel ﬁndings in pathogenesis of K-ras–induced lung tumorigenesis. Importantly, we further
showed that IL6 blockade not only has direct inhibitory effect on
tumor (epithelial) cells but also could skew protumor immunosuppressive environment toward an antitumor phenotype. Therefore, we propose using anti-IL6 treatment in combination with
targeting downstream effectors of K-ras (e.g., MEK) or immune
checkpoint molecules (e.g., PD-1, PDL-1) as an alternative strategy to subvert undruggable K-ras–mutant lung cancer.
