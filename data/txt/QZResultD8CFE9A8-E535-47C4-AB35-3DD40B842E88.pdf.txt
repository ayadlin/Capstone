BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment for progressive epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). To investigate the significant vascularization of EHE, the activity/toxicity of sorafenib in patients with progressive EHE was explored. METHODS: In this multicenter, 1-stage, phase 2 trial of sorafenib (800 mg daily), the primary endpoint, which was chosen by default, was the 9-month
progression-free rate. All patients had documented progressive disease at the time of study entry. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were
enrolled between June 2009 and February 2011. The median age was 57 years (range, 31-76 years), and the ratio of men to women
was 9:6. The performance status was zero in 10 patients and 1 in 5 patients. Twelve patients had metastases, mainly in the lung (12
patients), liver (5 patients), and bone (3 patients). Five patients had received prior chemotherapy (doxorubicin in 5 patients and taxane in 3 patients). The median sorafenib treatment duration was 124 days (range, from 27 to >271 days). Seven patients required
dose reductions or transient treatment discontinuation. The 9-month progression-free rate was 30.7% (4 of 13 patients). The 2-month,
4-month, and 6-month progression-free rate was 84.6% (11 of 13 patients), 46.4% (6 of 13 patients), and 38.4% (5 of 13 patients),
respectively. Two partial responses were observed that lasted 2 months and 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Further clinical trials exploring

INTRODUCTION
Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors.1,2 Locally advanced or metastatic sarcomas are generally
treated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment.3 In contrast, there is no standard second-line therapeutic option after failure on or intolerance to doxorubicin (because the available literature is a list of successive phase 2 trials, which identify some drugs with promising activity but with no confirmation by formal, comparative phase 3 trials4).
However, recent data on histology-driven or biologic target-oriented strategies seem promising.3 These studies indicate the necessity of conducting phase 2 trials in some exceptional subtypes.
Among the rarest histologic subtypes of sarcoma, “vascular sarcomas” or “highly vascularized sarcomas” (comprising
several separate entities, such as angiosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma [EHE], and malignant solitary fibrous
tumors [SFT]) are heterogeneous entities.5-8 No evidence for their optimal treatment is available,6,7 because clinical trials
focusing on this disease are rare,6,7 and some trials include the different entities in the same category.8 Among these
tumors, angiosarcoma is characterized by its aggressiveness (with a median overall survival of approximately 8 months)

and the short duration of the response to chemotherapy
(with a median time to progression of approximately 2-4
months).5 In contrast, EHEs are indolent diseases in most
patients.9,10
Metastatic/advanced EHE can be stable for years
before requiring systemic treatment and can spontaneously regress in some exceptional cases. Until now, there
has been no standard treatment for progressive and nonresectable EHE.9,10
The inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising
approach for treating sarcoma, especially in the case of
highly vascularized sarcoma. Indeed, EHEs express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).11,12 For these reasons, sorafenib, a small-molecule B-Raf and VEGF
receptor inhibitor, is a logical candidate for the treatment
of EHE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Eligibility Criteria

The patients who were considered for this study were
required to be aged 18 years. All had histologically proven EHE, as reviewed by an independent pathologist
(Y.M.R.), with metastasis or EHE of a locally advanced
stage not amenable to radiotherapy or curative-intent surgery after multidisciplinary decision making. Prior systemic treatment for EHE was allowed. Disease that was
measurable or assessable by computed tomography scanning was required according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines.13
Additional key eligibility criteria were as follows: at least 1
lesion measurable according to RECIST 1.1; evidence of
progression at the time of study entry; no brain or meningeal metastasis; no more than 2 prior episodes of chemotherapeutic treatment (irrespective of the indication);
World Health Organization performance status 2; white
blood cell count 3000/mm; platelet count 100,000/
mm3; hemoglobin 9 g/dL; and international normalized
ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, liver transaminase levels, total bilirubin, serum creatinine, and amylase
and lipase levels all 1.5 times the upper normal limit.
Disease progression within the past 6 months was defined
as progression according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines.13
Treatment

Patients received a starting dose of oral sorafenib 400 mg
twice daily until they reached intolerable toxicity, had tumor progression, or withdrew informed consent. Dose
reduction to 400 mg daily and then to 200 mg daily was
permitted for patients who experienced severe toxicities
(grade 3 or recurrent grade 2 toxicities). In the event of
2640

treatment discontinuation for toxicity, if the toxicity
grade was 1 or 0, then the drug was reintroduced within 3
weeks; in contrast, treatment was definitively discontinued for toxicity grade 2.
Study Endpoints

Given the indolent course of the disease, we chose 9month progression-free survival as the primary endpoint.
The secondary endpoints were as follows: 1) safety and
toxicity assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0); 2) response
rates at 2 months, 6 months, and 9 months; 3) overall survival; and 4) the median time to progression.
During the study, patients underwent clinical, hematologic, and biologic evaluations at baseline and on
days 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 270. Response to
treatment was assessed by comparing unidimensional tumor measurements (computed tomography scans) in pretreatment and per-treatment imaging studies at 2 months,
4 months, 6 months, and 9 months. We assessed the treatment response according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines. An
independent, third-party radiologist reviewed selected
imaging studies from all imaging performed during the
treatment period with the trial drug to ensure the consistent and unbiased application of RECIST.
Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Analysis

This study was designed as an exploratory, hypothesisgenerating, proof-of-concept study. The sample size was
chosen (n 5 15) based on practical considerations rather
than statistical power and type I error rate calculations,
with the objective of demonstrating the biologic activity
of this targeted therapy on a very homogenous group of
patients with EHE.
Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

The sponsor of this study was the Oscar Lambret Cancer
Center on behalf of the French Sarcoma Group (GSF/
GETO). The study was opened in 9 regional centers:
Claudius Regaud Institute, Toulouse; Gustave Roussy
Institute, Villejuif; Leon Berard Center, Lyon; Bergonie
Institue, Bordeaux; Georges-Francois Leclerc Center,
Dijon; Oscar Lambret Center, Lille; Jean Minjoz Hospital, Besancon; Jean Perrin Center, Clermont-Ferrand; and
Rene Gauducheau Center, Nantes. Study investigations
were conducted after approval by the regional ethics committee (approved June 16, 2009) and after declaration to
the French Health Products Safety Agency (approved
June 1, 2009). Informed consent was obtained from each
patient. The study was registered in the European Union

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

From June 2009 to February 2011, 15 patients (9 men
and 6 women) were enrolled in 8 centers. The median age
was 57 years (range, 31-76 years). All patients were eligible and had evidence of tumor progression at the time of
study entry. Performance status was zero in 10 patients
(67%) and 1 in 5 patients (33%). The most common primary sites were the liver in 4 patients, the head and neck
in 2 patients, and the superficial trunk in 2 patients. The
other primary sites (1 patient per location) were as follows: lower limb, upper limb, buttock, pleura, retroperitoneum, lung, and unknown primary site. One tumor
arose in irradiated fields (in a patient with head and neck
EHE). The tumor was locally advanced and was not amenable to surgery in 3 patients. Metastases were present at
study entry in 12 patients (80%), and the most common
metastatic sites were as follows: lung (12 v patients), liver
(5 patients), and bone (3 patients). Prior treatments
included surgery in 7 patients (46%), radiotherapy in 5
patients (33%), and chemotherapy in 5 patients (33%).
The best responses obtained with the prior chemotherapy
were disease progression in 3 patients, stable disease (lasting 11 months) in 1 patient, and not assessable in 1
patient. The number of prior line(s) of chemotherapy was
1 line in 2 patients, 2 lines in 2 patients, and 3 lines in 1
patient. Five patients had previously received anthracycline, and 3 had previously received taxanes. The median
interval between diagnosis and study entry was 29 months
(range, 1-168 months).
Safety and Toxicity

Safety was assessable in 15 patients. The median duration
of treatment was 124 days (range, from 21 to 271 days).
Three patients (20%) required dose reductions (usually in
the first 4 weeks), and 5 patients (33%) required transient
drug discontinuation. The causes of transient treatment

related to sorafenib.

discontinuation were as follows: grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in 2 patients, grade 3 diarrhea in 1 patient, and
grade 3 mucositis plus anorexia in 1 patient. Eight
patients (53%) did not require transient drug continuation or dose adaptation. Table 1 lists the toxicities
observed. The safety profile was consistent with previous
reports. No toxic deaths were noted.
Efficacy

The median follow-up was 12 months, the median progression-free survival was 6 months (Fig. 1), and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached (2-year OS
rate, 26%; 4 of 15 patients) (Fig. 2). The treatment
response was assessable for 13 patients (Table 2). According to the study protocol, patients who were assessable for
response were those who had received sorafenib for at least
28 days (2 patients were not considered assessable because
of definitive drug discontinuation for unacceptable toxicity within the first 28 days). The nonprogression rate at 9
months was 30.7% (4 of 13 patients). The nonprogression rates at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months were
84.6% (11 of 13 patients), 46.4% (6 of 13 patients), and
38.4% (5 of 13 patients), respectively. No complete
responses were observed (Fig. 3). Two patients experienced partial responses lasting 2 months and 14
months.

DISCUSSION
We conducted a phase 2 trial of sorafenib in patients with
EHE as a subgroup from a larger phase 2 trial investigating sorafenib in “vascular” sarcoma. All patients had progressive disease at the time of study entry. The tolerance
to the drug was as expected. Sorafenib provided long-lasting (>6 months) tumor growth arrest in >33% of
patients. Partial responses were rare (2 of 15 patients).
The literature on the treatment of EHE with antiangiogenic agents is very limited and consists of a large retrospective study that was presented as an abstract and is not
yet published,14 some case reports, and 2 prospective series, as summarized in Table 3.15-21 Cioffi et al reported a
retrospective study of 42 other patients with metastatic
EHE. Thirty-four of those patients received systemic
treatment, including conventional doxorubicin-contain-

ing regimens (16 patients), other chemotherapy regimens
(6 patients), and angiogenesis-targeting drugs or tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (12 patients: sorafenib in 6 patients, thalidomide in 2 patients, metronomic cyclophosphamide in
2 patients, and imatinib mesylate in 2 patients). No objective responses were reported. Fourteen patients experienced stable disease for 6 months. The patients with stable
disease included 4 of 16 patients (25%) who received doxorubicin-containing regimens, 4 of 6 patients (25%) who
received other chemotherapy regimens, and 6 of 12
patients who received angiogenesis-targeting drugs or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (3 of 6 patients who received sorafenib [50%], 2 of 2 patients who received metronomic
chemotherapy, and 1 of 2 patients who received thalidomide). The median progression-free survival was 4.8
months, and the median OS was 41.0 months. Nevertheless, in that retrospective study, the number of patients
who experienced progressive disease before starting systemic treatment was not reported.14 Limited experience
with treatments like thalidomide, interferon 2a-a, and
bevacizumab have been reported (Table 3). These treatments seem to provide long-lasting stable disease in all
patients and produced a partial response in 1 patient.16
Agulnik et al recently reported the activity of bevacizumab
in patients with vascular sarcoma (mainly angiosarcoma21). Seven patients with EHE received bevacizumab
in that phase 2 trial. The reported activity was a response
in 2 of 7 patients, a median progression-free survival of 10
months, and a median OS of 36 months. Nevertheless,
the number of patients who had documented disease progression before study entry was not stated in the report by
Agulnik et al. Regarding disease heterogeneity, the status
of disease heterogeneity before treatment, the heterogeneity of treatment, and direct comparison of the objective
response rate, median progression-free survival, and median OS across the reported data were not relevant.

This study had several limitations. The major methodological limitation was the choice of primary endpoint
(9-month progression-free survival). We chose this longterm outcome because most EHEs have an indolent
course, and we believe that clinical benefit has to be measured after several months (at least after 6 months). We
cannot justify this choice based on previously reported
clinical trials, because there is still no published trial focusing on this exceptional form of sarcoma. Furthermore,
because of the lack of a statistical hypothesis, the observed
data remain difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, in a previously reported retrospective study,14 there was no objective response, whereas sorafenib provided 2 partial
responses in the current study. However, 1 of those objective responses lasted 2 months, which may be considered
an unconfirmed partial response.
Cancer

July 15, 2013

We conclude that sorafenib is a potentially active
drug for the treatment of patients with EHE. These findings require further clinical investigation and, if possible,
a randomized trial, eg a double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial or a phase 2 randomized discontinuation trial (maintenance of sorafenib vs drug holiday in nonprogressive
patients treated with sorafenib)m22,23 However, this tumor is so rare that an international effort will be needed to
achieve this goal.
