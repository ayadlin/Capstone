ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world,
and finding novel agents for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer is of urgent
need. Diphenyl difluoroketone (EF24), a molecule having structural similarity to
curcumin, exhibits potent anti-tumor activities by arresting cell cycle and inducing
apoptosis. Although EF24 demonstrates potent anticancer efﬁcacy in numerous types
of human cancer cells, the cellular targets of EF24 have not been fully deﬁned. We
report here that EF24 may interact with the thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), an
important selenocysteine (Sec)-containing antioxidant enzyme, to induce reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells. By
inhibiting TrxR1 activity and increasing intracellular ROS levels, EF24 induces a lethal
endoplasmic reticulum stress in human gastric cancer cells. Importantly, knockdown
of TrxR1 sensitizes cells to EF24 treatment. In vivo, EF24 treatment markedly reduces
the TrxR1 activity and tumor cell burden, and displays synergistic lethality with 5-FU
against gastric cancer cells. Targeting TrxR1 with EF24 thus discloses a previously
unrecognized mechanism underlying the biological activity of EF24, and reveals that
TrxR1 is a good target for gastric cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

[5], and anti-virus [6]. Moreover, structural curcumin
analogs have been designed to optimize the therapeutic
effects of curcumin by enhancing potency, reducing sideeffects, and increasing bioavailability [7-9]. Diphenyl
difluoroketone (EF24), a new compound having close
structural similarity to curcumin, has been reported to
inhibit the proliferation of a variety of cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo [10, 11]. Due to the dual advantages in
both pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, EF24 received
much attention from pharmacologists in the world. It is
one of curcumin analogs most close to anti-cancer clinical
study. A number of molecular targets in various types of
cells, such as NF-κB [12], p53 [13], HIF-1α [11, 14], AKT
[10], mitogen-activated protein kinase family [15], and
phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome

Natural products and their derivatives have
historically been invaluable as a source of therapeutic
agents, and served human kind in the treatment of various
diseases for centuries [1, 2]. It is roughly estimated that
half of modern marketed drugs originate from natural
products [3]. Thus, the past decades have witnessed
increasing interest in identifying the active chemical
components and their cellular targets, which leads to
discovering numerous new therapeutic agents, such as
vinblastine, rapamycin, and paclitaxel.
As an excellent natural compound, curcumin has
been extensively investigated for its potential biological
benefits, including anti-tumor [4], anti-inflammation

(PTEN) [16], have been reported to be affected by EF24.
Despite its undoubted anticancer efficacy, the molecular
mechanism underlying the action of EF24 still elusive,
and the primary cellular target and mode of action of this
molecule remain unclear.
The mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs)
are a family of selenium-containing pyridine nucleotidedisulphide oxidoreductases. There are currently two
confirmed forms of mammalian TrxRs, TrxR1 and
TrxR2, which are found in cytoplasm and mitochondria,
respectively [17, 18]. TrxR1 was overexpressed in many
human tumors and has a key role in regulating intracellular
redox balance [19-21]. TrxR1 inactivation by chemical
inhibition or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
knockdown inhibits self-sufficiency of tumor cells,
reverts the malignant phenotype, and sensitizes tumor
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs [22-24]. Hence, TrxR1
has emerged as a valuable target for anticancer drug
development [25, 26].
In the present study, we discovered that EF24
may interact with TrxR1 both in vitro and in vivo. EF24
primarily targets the Sec residue of the antioxidant enzyme
TrxR1 to inhibit its Trx-reduction activity, but further
elicits a new function of generating reactive oxygen
species. Accumulation of ROS disrupts the intracellular
redox balance, activates ER-stress and eventually induces
apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of TrxR1
in cells enhances the cyto-toxicity of EF24. Remarkably,
EF24 treatment significantly reduces the TrxR1 activity
and tumor cell burden in vivo. In addition, EF24 displays
synergistic lethality with 5-FU in vivo. Targeting TrxR1
by EF24 thus reveals an unprecedented mechanism
underlying the biological action of EF24 and sheds deep
light on the potential application of EF24 in the treatment
of cancer.

that EF24 treatment also dose-dependently inhibited the
expression of cell cycle-related proteins such as MDM2
and Cdc2 in these gastric cancer cells. In contrast, p53 was
significantly increased with EF24 treatment (Figure 1E).
These data suggest that the inhibition of cell proliferation
by EF24 is partly associated with the induction of G2/M
phase arrest.

EF24 induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer
cells
We further examined the pro-apoptosis effect of
EF24 on human gastric cancer cells using Annexin V/
Propidium Iodide (PI) staining assay. As shown in Figure
2A and 2B, all of three gastric cancer cell lines have
shown a concentration-dependent apoptosis after a 24 h
treatment with EF24. Then we determined the levels of
apoptosis-related proteins in SGC-7901 and BGC-823
cells treated with EF24. Figure 2C showed that treatment
with EF24 for 20 h dose-dependently increased the
expression of cleaved-PARP and Bax, whereas Bcl-2 was
downregulated compared with non-EF24-treated controls.
These results suggest that the anti-cancer effect of EF24 is
also associated with the induction of cell apoptosis.

EF24 activates ER stress, which contributes to
EF24 lethality in gastric cancer cells
The next step is to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of the anti-cancer effects of EF24. SGC-7901
cells were used for the subsequent studies. It is reported
that ER stress plays an important role in the initiation
of curcumin-induced apoptosis [27, 28]. Therefore, we
hypothesize that exacerbation of ER stress contributes
to gastric cancer cells apoptosis by EF24 treatment.
We next examined the expressions of ER stress-related
proteins, such as p-eIF2α and ATF4 in EF24-treated
gastric cancer cells. The time-course result indicated that
EF24 (7.5 μM) could significantly activates ER stress. The
expression levels of p-eIF2α and ATF4 reached the peak
at 3-6 h after treatment (Figure 3A). EF24 also showed
dose-dependent activation of the two protein expressions
in the gastric cancer cells (Figure 3B). CHOP induction
is probably the most sensitive to ER stress response,
and CHOP is considered as a marker of commitment of
ER stress-induced apoptosis [29]. We found that EF24
treatment significantly induced CHOP protein expression
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). To confirm the
accumulation of misfolded proteins in ER, the effect of
EF24 on the morphology of ER in SGC-7901 cells was
observed through electron microscopy. Compared with
DMSO-treated SGC-7901 cells, the ER in SGC-7901 cells
after 3 h of treatment with EF24 (7.5 μM) became swelling
(arrow), suggesting the accumulation of misfolded
proteins in ER (Figure 3D). We next determined the

cancer cells but not normal cells
The cytotoxic effects of EF24 were tested in
cultured human gastric cancer cells and normal cells.
EF24 treatment markedly inhibited the growth of gastric
cancer cells, while the viability of normal GES-1 and
NRK-52E cells were affected only minimally at the
highest concentration (10 μM) tested (Figure 1A-1B). To
determine whether the growth inhibition of gastric cancer
cells by EF24 was caused by cell cycle arrest, gastric
cells were treated with various concentrations of EF24
for 14 h. The results in Figure 1C and 1D showed that
EF24 treatment significantly induced G2/M cell cycle
arrest in human gastric cancer SGC-7901, BGC-823
and KATO III cells. Western blotting analysis indicated

in EF24-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells (Figure

apoptosis is at least partly mediated by ER stress pathway.

It has been recognized that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production in cancer cells triggered by some
therapeutic agents is one of the mechanisms underlying
their cytotoxicity [30-32]. Also, ROS overproduction has

EF24 directly binds and inactivates TrxR1 in
human gastric cancer cells

been reported to activate ER stress and mitochondrial
apoptosis [33]. Therefore, we determined the production
of intracellular ROS in EF24-treated and untreated cells
by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment with
EF24 in SGC-7901 cells caused a time-dependent increase
in DCF-reactive ROS. Using a series of fluorescent probes
specific for individual species of ROS, we found that
hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, but not superoxide
anion, were among the ROS species induced by EF24 in
gastric cancer cells. In addition, treatment with EF24 for
1 h in SGC-7901 cells caused a dose-dependent increase
in DCF-reactive ROS (Figure 4B). To identify the role
of ROS in mediating EF24’s anti-cancer effects, ROS
inhibitor NAC and catalase were used. Interestingly, it
was found that co-treatment with NAC or catalase fully
reversed the EF24-induced increase in ROS (Figure 4C4D). Similar results were observed in the cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis assay detected by flow cytometry (Figure
4E). These findings demonstrate that ROS generation is
the key regulator of EF24-induced apoptosis.

The thioredoxin system is multifunctional redox
active protein disulphide reductase systems, widely
distributed in nature [34]. Accumulating evidence showed
that ROS might be produced when the mammalian
TrxR1 was chemically inhibited [30, 35]. Analysis of
the chemical structure of EF24 reveals that this molecule
belongs to a class of highly reactive organic compounds
whose chemical structures (michael acceptor) allow them
to interact with biological molecules by forming covalent
bonds [36, 37]. Thus we speculated that EF24 might be
a novel inhibitor of TrxR. Then, we evaluated the direct
inhibitory effects of EF24 on TrxR1 enzyme activity
by using the DTNB and the endpoint insulin reduction
assay. When prereduced recombinant human TrxR1 was
incubated with various concentrations of EF24 for 2 h,
the DTNB-reducing activity of TrxR1 was decreased in a
dose-dependent manner. To further explore the inhibition

EF24 inhibits SGC-7901 xenograft tumor growth
in vivo, accompanied with decreased TrxR1
activity and increased ROS level

of TrxR1 by EF24, we determined the potency of EF24 at
inhibiting the TrxR1 in SGC-7901 cells. Consistent with
the inhibition of recombinant human TrxR1 protein, TrxR1
activity in cell lysates also decreased with increasing
EF24 concentration (Figure 5A). Thus, it is confirmed
that EF24 can inhibit TrxR1 enzyme activity in vitro. To
further investigate the underlying structural mechanism
of EF24 binding to the TrxR1 protein, we performed a
molecular simulation of EF24-TrxR1 complex using
docking software. As shown in Figure 5B, the michael
acceptor of EF24 form a covalent bond with the residue
Cys-498 of the C-terminal active site redox center of
TrxR1. Additionally, EF24 interacts with the residues
Cys-497 through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Thus,
the proposed reaction mechanism for EF24 is to block
simultaneously the adjacent C-terminal active site residues
Cys and Sec of TrxR1, which is expected to effectively
suppress TrxR1 activity.
Above data suggested the importance of TrxR1 in
EF24-induced ROS production and cell apoptosis. To
validate this note, genetic knockdown of TrxR1 was used
in SGC-7901 cells. Knockdown of TrxR1 by two separate
TrxR1 siRNAs showed that Seq1 and Seq2 markedly
reduced TrxR1 expression in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 5C).
The TrxR1 knockdown by either Seq1 or Seq2 resulted in
an appreciable increase in EF24-induced ROS levels and
apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 5D and 5E). GSH
is a pivotal component of the glutathione system, which
is a redox regulation network in cells in addition to the
thioredoxin system, and it also acts as a backup of the
thioredoxin system [38]. The depletion of GSH by erastin
in SGC-7901 cells significantly sensitizing the cells to
EF24 supported the involvement of the thioredoxin system
in the biological action of EF24 (Figure 5F). Abundant
intracellular ROS may cause DNA damage and activate
down-streamed signaling pathway. Therefore, it was
interested to investigate whether the ER-stress pathway
was activated by combined treatment. As shown in Figure
5G, treatment of cell with EF24 alone slightly induced
the expressions of p-eIF2α and ATF4. However, EF24
and erastin in combination dramatically activated ERstress pathway, as convinced by significantly enhanced
expressions of p-eIF2α and ATF4. In addition, NAC and
catalase pretreatment completely blocked the combined
treatment-induced overexpression of p-eIF2α and ATF4
and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 5H and 5I).
These results demonstrate that EF24 directly bound to
TrxR1, and then increased cellular ROS and induced
cancer cell apoptosis.

To evaluate the in vivo impact of EF24 treatment,
we used a subcutaneous xenograft model of SGC7901 cells in immunodeficient mice. Intraperitoneal
administration of EF24 at doses of both 3 and 6 mg/
kg for 17 days significantly reduced SGC-7901 tumor
volume and weight versus vehicle control (Figure 6A6C). Importantly, EF24 treatment for 17 days was well
tolerated, without significant weight loss (Figure 6D). In
addition, we found that EF24 dose-dependently increased
the level of lipid peroxidation product (MDA), a marker
of ROS, in tumor tissues (Figure 6E). TrxR1 activity in
tumor xenografts was measured by the endpoint insulin
reduction assay, and the result indicated that EF24
treatment significantly decreased the activity of TrxR1
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6F). Furthermore,
EF24 remarkably amplifies the therapeutic effect of
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in vivo, as convinced by significantly
decreased tumor volume and weight (Figure 6A-6C).
The in vivo mechanistic studies revealed that combined
treatment inhibited tumor xenografts by inhibiting TrxR1
activity and activating oxidative stress (Figure 6E-6F).
Taken together, these results indicate that EF24 exhibits
potent anti-tumor activity and high safety in vivo, and
EF24 can synergistically enhance 5FU-induced tumor
growth inhibition in vivo by targeting TrxR1.

DISCUSSION
Various chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin,
5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin have been used to treat gastric
cancer. Unfortunately, all of these anticancer drugs affect
not only pathological tumor cells, but also normal cells
[39-41]. Therefore, the search for new chemopreventive
and antitumor agents that are more effective but less
toxic has become a matter of great interest. EF24, a new
compound having close structural similarity to curcumin,
has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of a variety
of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [11, 13, 15]. To date,
the mechanism responsible for anti-cancer effects of
EF24 remains elusive, and the primary cellular target of
this molecule remain unclear. Our study show that EF24
treatment inactivates TrxR1, exacerbates endoplasmic
reticulum stress and preferentially kills human gastric
cancer cells. In addition, our data suggest that the strategy
to use EF24 and 5-FU in combination could be a highly
efficient way to achieve anticancer synergism by targeting
TrxR1 in vivo.
The thioredoxin system has emerged as an important
target in cancer chemotherapy, because both Trx1 and
TrxR1 have been shown to be overexpressed in a variety
of human cancer types and associated with increased

tumor growth, drug resistance and poor patient prognosis
[19, 23, 42, 43]. Thus, the past years have witnessed
increasing attention to developing novel inhibitors of the
system as potential antitumor agents. In the current study,
we identiﬁed TrxR1 as a target of EF24 and demonstrated
that EF24 induces apoptosis through a previously
uncharacterized mechanism by targeting this enzyme.
Binding of EF24 to TrxR1 inhibits the physiological
functions of TrxR1, which leads to ROS accumulation
within cells, consequently causing intracellular thiol
depletion and ﬁnally eliciting oxidative stress. The
glutathione and thioredoxin systems are two predominant
networks that work independently but with some
overlaps in maintaining the intracellular redox balance
and defending against oxidative stress [44]. Recent
studies indicate that the glutathione system can act as a
backup of the thioredoxin system [38]. Interestingly, our
results showed that downregulation of intracellular GSH
by erastin significantly enhanced EF24’s cytotoxicity.
Combination therapy inhibiting both GSH and TrxR
antioxidant pathways may yield success when applied in
the clinical setting. Further insight into the roles of other
antioxidants, and how they act both alone and together,
will no doubt provide important clues into more effective
treatments for cancer patients.

ER is also well known to regulate cellular responses
to stress. Disturbance of ER homeostasis results in the
activation of unfolded protein response. Accumulation
of misfolded proteins in ER can cause ER stress and
ultimately lead to apoptosis [45]. ER stress-induced
cancer cell apoptosis becomes an important signaling
target for development of cancer therapeutic drugs. The
inductions of cancer cell apoptosis by some anti-cancer
agents such as auranofin [35], farnesol [46] and arsenic
trioxide [47] have been reported to be mediated by ER
stress. Curcumin has also been found to activate ER stress
in various cancer cell lines [27, 48]. In consistent with
these findings, EF24 treatment concomitantly induces ER
stress response, which is highlighted by elevated levels
of p-eIF2α, and ATF4, as well as increase in the levels of
CHOP. CHOP is considered as a marker of commitment of
ER stress-induced apoptosis [29]. Findings presented here
demonstrated that the siRNA-mediated knockdown of
CHOP modestly inhibits EF24-induced apoptosis suggest
that EF24-induced ER stress is a secondary response to
EF24-induced ROS in gastric cancer cells. Collectively,
our results underscore that EF24-induced oxidative stress
is linked to proteotoxic and ER stress-based UPR, which
can amplify the lethal effects of EF24 in gastric cancer
cells.

Cell cycle analysis

In conclusion, we have discovered TrxR1 as a target
of EF24, both in vitro and in vivo, and demonstrated that
EF24 induces apoptotic cell death through ROS-mediated
ER-stress. The observation that EF24 has synergistic
cytotoxic effects with 5-FU sheds new light on the
possibility of treating tumors with EF24 in combination
with existing oxidative stress-causing anticancer drugs
or physical treatments. The discovery of EF24-TrxR1
interaction provides deep insight into the understanding of
how EF24 acts in vivo and this novel targeting mechanism
may lead to the development of potent small-molecule
TrxR1 inhibitors as potential cancer chemotherapeutic
agents.

species

Cellular ROS contents were measured by flow
cytometry as described previously [8]. Briefly, 5×105 cells
were plated on 60-mm dishes, allowed to attach overnight,
and exposed to EF24 for the indicated time periods. Cells
were stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA, 5 μM DAF-FM-DA
or 5 μM DHE (Beyotime Biotech, Nantong, China) at
37°C for 30 min. Cells were collected and the fluorescence
was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, CA). In some experiments, cells were
pretreated with NAC or catalase for 2 h prior exposure to
compounds and analysis of ROS generation.

Western blotting analysis
Cells were homogenized in protein lysate buffer,
and debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for
10 min at 4°C. The protein concentrations in all samples
were determined by using the Bradford protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After addition of sample
loading buffer, protein samples were electrophoresed
and then transferred to poly-vinylidene difluoride
transfer membranes. The blots were blocked for 2 h at
room temperature with fresh 5% nonfat milk in TBST
and then incubated with specific primary antibody
in TBST overnight at 4°C. Following three washes
with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h,
and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by using
ECL kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The density of the
immunoreactive bands was analyzed using Image J
computer software (National Institute of Health, MD).

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density
of 8×103 per well and allowed to grow overnight in RPMI
1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. EF24 was
dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 1640 medium to final
concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 μM. The
tumor cells were incubated with EF24 for 24 h before the
MTT assay.

In vitro TrxR activity assays

Transient transfection of small interfering RNA
(siRNA)

The TrxR activity was determined by the DTNB
assay at room temperature using a microplate reader
(SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, USA). The
NADPH-reduced TrxR (170 nM) was incubated with
various concentrations of EF24 for 2 h at room temperature
(the final volume of the reaction mixture was 50 μL) in a
96-well plate. A master mixture of TE buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 μL) containing DTNB and
NADPH was added (final concentrations: 2 mM and 200
μM, respectively), and the linear increase in absorbance
at 412 nm during the initial 3 min was recorded. The
same amounts of DMSO (1%, v/v) were added to the
control experiments and the activity was expressed as the
percentage of the control.

The sequences for the CHOP siRNA construct
were described previously [8]. Small interfering RNA
molecules, specifically targeting the TrxR1 mRNA, were
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For phenotypic
confirmation, two different siRNA sequences were
used (herein named Seq1 and Seq2). Seq1, sense
5′-(GCAAGACUCUCGAAAUUAU)dTdT-3′, antisense
5′-(AUAAUUUCGAGAGUCUUGC)dAdG-3′, Seq2,
sense5′-(CUUUGCAGCUGCGCUCA
AA)dTdT-3′,
antisense 5′-(UUUGAGCGCAGCUGCAAAG)dTdT3′. The siRNA duplexes targeting CHOP and TrxR1
were transduced into SGC-7901 cells. Forty-eight hours
posttransduction, the cells were washed with complete
media and plated with or without EF24 for 12 h for
immunoblot analysis or 24 h for assessing apoptosis.

Determination of TrxR activity in cells or tumor
tissues

Electron microscopy

After cells were treated with various concentrations
of EF24 for 2 h, the cells were harvested and protein
extracted with RIPA buffer. The total protein content
was determined by using the Bradford protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). TrxR activity in cell lysates
or tumor tissues was measured by the end point insulin
reduction assay. Briefly, the cell extract containing 100
μg of total proteins was incubated in a final reaction
volume of 50 μL containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
0.3 mM insulin, 660 μM NADPH, 3 mM EDTA, and 15
μM E. coli Trx (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37
°C. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μL of 1
mM DTNB in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8.0).
A blank sample, containing everything except Trx, was
treated in the same manner. The absorbance at 412 nm
was measured, and the blank value was subtracted from
the corresponding absorbance value of the sample. The
activity was expressed as the percentage of the control.

SGC-7901 cells were treated with vehicle control
(DMSO, 3 μL) or EF24 at the dose of 7.5 μM for indicated
time in 60 mm plates. Then the cells were collected and
fixed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5%
glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. The cells were postfixed
in 1% OsO4 at room temperature for 60 min, stained with
1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through graded acetone
solutions, and embedded in epon. Areas containing cells
were block mounted and cut into 70 nm sections and
examined with the electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi,
Ibaraki, Japan).

In vivo antitumor study
All animal experiments were complied with the
Wenzhou Medical University’s Policy on the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocols for animal studies
were approved by the Wenzhou Medical College Animal
Policy and Welfare Committee (Approved documents:
2012/APWC/0216). Five-week-old athymic BALB/
cA nu/nu female mice (18-22 g) purchased from Vital
River Laboratories (Beijing, China) were used for in vivo
experiments. Animals were housed at a constant room
temperature with a 12 h : 12 h light/dark cycle and fed
a standard rodent diet and water. SGC-7901 cells were
harvested and injected subcutaneously into the right flank
(5 ×106 cells in 100 μL of PBS). Mice were treated by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg EF24
once every other day, or by i.p. injection of 20 mg/kg 5-FU
every other day, or with a combination of EF24 (3 mg/kg)
and 5-FU (20 mg/kg) according to the same schedules.
The tumor volumes were determined by measuring length
(l) and width (w) and calculating volume (V = 0.5 × l ×

Docking of EF24 to the TrxR1 structural model
To further study the interaction between the
EF24 and TrxR1, a covalent dock was implement by
CovalentDock [49]. The crystal structure of human
TrxR1 (PDB code 2ZZ0, chain A) was used for present
docking study. The center coordination of dock pocket
was set as -29.11, -1.26, and -6.55 which calculated by
selecting residue Cys-497 and Cys-498. A grid box size of
60×60×60 points with a spacing of 0.375 Å between the
grid points was implemented. The default parameters were
used for running the docking simulation.

MDA assay
Tumors were harvested after all mice were
sacrificed. The tissue samples were homogenized and
sonicated in RIPA buffer on ice. Tissue lysates were then
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the
supernatant. The total protein content was determined by
using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Tumor tissue proteins were normalized according
to their concentrations and subjected to MDA assay
as described in the Lipid Peroxidation MDA assay kit
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nantong, China).
MDA levels were detected using multimode microplate
readers (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, USA) at 532
nm.
