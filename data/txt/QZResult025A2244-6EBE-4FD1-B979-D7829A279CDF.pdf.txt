ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells are proposed to be responsible for resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin. As phenylbutyrate enhances cancer
stem cell properties, we analyzed surviving lymphoma cells after treatment with
doxorubicin and phenylbutyrate. Human B-cell lymphoma cell lines, including Toledo,
BJAB, Daudi, and Raji were incubated with IC90 concentrations of doxorubicin (300 nM)
or phenylbutyrate (8 mM). After 48 h, live cells were sorted and analyzed for their
resistance to treatment by examining gene expression profiles using cDNA microarray
and biological characteristics. A small fraction of lymphoma cells that survived after
drug application showed higher expression of stem cell markers (NANOG, and SOX2)
and superior ability of self-renewal and sphere formation, compared to untreated
control cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression analysis disclosed elevated expression
of 41 genes, including FOXO4, in the four lymphoma cell lines that survived drug
treatment. Overexpression of FOXO4 was evident in lymphoma cells surviving
after phenylbutyrate treatment and refractory patient-derived lymphoma cells.
Induction of FOXO4 expression promoted self-renewal whereas its knockdown led to
diminished expression of stem cell markers and colony-forming ability of lymphoma
cells. Immunohistochemical staining for FOXO4 in tumor tissue of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma revealed nuclear localization and significant association with poor
prognosis. In conclusion, lymphoma cells resistant to treatment exhibit stem cell-like
properties and enhanced FOXO4 expression. The presence of FOXO4-expressing cells
in tumor tissue and their association with poor survival supports a role of FOXO4 in
promoting stem cell properties resulting in poor outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

sensitive to chemotherapy. However, a substantial number
of patients still fail to be cured and these treatment failures
are mainly associated with drug resistance. Lymphoma
cells could acquire drug resistance during they were
repeatedly exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. However,
a subset of cells with a peculiar characteristics leading
to primary refractoriness to chemotherapy might exist

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the
most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
accounting for ~30–40% of lymphomas in Western and
Asian countries [1]. DLBCL is a curable disorder by
systemic chemotherapy because lymphoma cells are

at diagnosis even though it has never been treated with
chemotherapeutic agents. The concept of cancer stem
cells (CSC) has been proposed to explain the existence
of a cell population responsible for tumorigenesis as well
as primary refractoriness to treatment in patients [2–4].
The CSC hypothesis postulates that this specific cell
population can self-renew and produce daughter cells,
continuously leading to treatment failure [5]. Consistently,
the association of this cell population with poor prognosis
has been suggested in several cancer types, including
breast, brain and colon cancer, following the first report on
the presence of CSCs in acute myeloid leukemia [6–10].
Thus, accumulating data support the involvement of CSCs
in treatment resistance resulting in tumor relapse and
metastasis [11, 12]. At present, limited data on CSCs in
DLBCL are available due to a lack of definitive markers,
although a few potential markers have been identified in
other B-cell lymphomas [13, 14].
In the current study, we developed an in vitro model
mimicking a cell population that is primarily refractory
to treatment by isolating a cell subset that survived
after treatment with the drug at IC90 concentrations
(required for 90% inhibition of tumor cell growth).
Given that surviving cells after long-term exposure to
low-dose drug may represent those cells with acquired
rather than intrinsic resistance, we treated cells with
high concentrations of drug for a short duration of time.
Doxorubicin and phenylbutyrate were used for drug
treatment, since doxorubicin is the main chemotherapeutic
agent in various regimens for DLBCL and phenylbutyrate
is a histone deacetylase inhibitor reported to induce
stemness in human induced pluripotent stem cells [15].
Gene expression profiles of the surviving cell population
revealed consistent overexpression of forkhead box O 4
(FOXO4), compared with the control group. Although
FOXO transcription factors are considered tumor
suppressors, contributory roles to cancer progression
and maintenance of CSCs in acute and chronic myeloid
leukemia have been recently described [16–18].
Accordingly, we examined the potential function of
FOXO4 in B-cell lymphoma cell populations showing
stem cell-like properties, and demonstrated its prognostic
value in DLBCL patients.

incubation with doxorubicin (300 nM) or phenylbutyrate
(8 mM) was different from control cells, and their
immunophenotype was also different (Figure 1A, 1B). The
comparison of immunophenotype using B-cell marker,
CD19 showed both groups, surviving cells after treatment
with doxorubicin and phenylbutyrate had significantly
higher number of CD19-negative cells than control
groups. Thus, the proportion of CD45+/CD19− cells
which was previously reported as CSC of B-cell
lymphoma was significantly higher in surviving cells
than control cells (Figure 1B) [13, 14]. Given the nature
of drug resistance of surviving cells after IC90 dose of
phenylbutyrate (PB cells), drug sensitivity was analyzed.
Compared to control cells, BJAB-PB and Raji-PB cells
showed higher viability when they were exposed to
various concentrations of doxorubicin, prednisolone and
rituximab (Figure 1C). Especially, the median inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of doxorubicin were 28.04 and
39.33 nM for BJAB and Raji control cells whereas
those for BJAB-PB and Raji-PB cells were over 300 nM
(P < 0.05). Thus, phenylbutyrate-treated surviving cells
showed resistance to other anti-lymphoma agents.

Stem cell-like properties of B-cell lymphoma
cells surviving drug treatment
Because CSC could be related to drug resistance
and tumor sphere formation is a surrogate marker of selfrenewal of cancer stem cells, we sorted live cells via flow
cytometry and plated them in stem cell-selective conditions
to observe formation of spheres. As a result, cells surviving
after phenylbutyrate treatment generated significantly
higher number of tumor spheres compared to control cells
(Figure 2A). As phenylbutyrate is known to induce stem
cell-like properties in mature tumor cells [15], we further
evaluated stem cell-like properties in phenylbutyratetreated surviving cells. In the soft agar colony formation
assays, PB cells showed greater colony formation than
control cells (Figure 2B, 2C). In accordance with these
findings, the expression of stem cell markers (NANOG
and SOX2) was significantly higher in B-cell lymphoma
cells survived after phenylbutyrate and doxorubicin
treatment than control cells (Figure 2D). This increased
expression of stem cell markers was also observed in other
B-cell lymphoma cell lines survived after phenylbutyrate
and doxorubicin treatment (OCI-Ly10, Riva, and U2932,
Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, BJAB-PB and
Raji-PB cells exhibited slower proliferation rates than
control cells (Supplementary Figure S2). In consistent
with these stem cell-like properties, the BJAB-PB and
Raji-PB cells showed significantly higher proportion of
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells than
control cells (Figure 2E) because ALDH is known as a
marker for CSC [19]. The BJAB-PB and Raji-PB cells
also showed the enrichment of side-population compared
to control cells (Figure 2F), thus, these cell populations

RESULTS
Generation of B-cell lymphoma cells surviving
drug treatment
Seven lymphoma cell lines (BJAB, Raji, Daudi,
Toledo, OCI-Ly10, RIVA, and U2932) were treated with
the IC90 dose of doxorubicin (300 nM) or phenylbutyrate
(8 mM) for 48 h. The majority of cells died after treatment
with a few surviving cells, and the proportions of viable
cells are specified in Supplementary Table S1. The

FOXO4 was one of the candidate genes identified because
FOXO transcription factors, which are directly inhibited
by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, have been implicated
in stem cell maintenance of several cell lineages [22].
Increased expression of FOXO4 in phenylbutyrate-treated
surviving cells was confirmed in three B-cell lymphoma
cell lines (BJAB, Raji and Daudi) and this increased
expression of FOXO4 was also found in vorinostat-treated
surviving cells (Figure 3B, 3C). FOXO4 expression
was also significantly enhanced in surviving cells from
other DLBCL cell lines (OCI-Ly10, Riva, and U2932)
(Supplementary Figure S3). The increased expression of
FOXO4 was found in B-cell lymphoma patient-derived
cells. Thus, when three patient-derived primary cells
were treated with phenylbutyrate in the same method as
cell lines, phenylbutyrate-treated surviving cells showed
significant higher expression of FOXO4 than control
cells (Figure 3D). Moreover, primary cells obtained

represented CSC like previous reports [20, 21]. When we
applied another histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat on
B-cell lymphoma cells with the same manner, the similar
effect of vorinostat on the stemness of lymphoma cells
was observed in BJAB and Raji cells (Figure 2G, 2H).

Analysis of gene expression profiles and FOXO4
overexpression
The cDNA microarray analysis was performed
to identify the differentially expressed target genes
between treatment-surviving and corresponding control
cells (Figure 3A). Comparison of the gene expression
profiles in four lymphoma cell lines (BJAB, Raji,
Toledo, and Daudi) revealed that 41 genes are commonly
overexpressed in cells surviving treatment with
doxorubicin or phenylbutyrate, compared with untreated
control cells (Supplementary Table S2). Among 41 genes,

B-cell lymphoma patients showed significantly more
increased expression of FOXO4 than that of a patient who
completely responded to 1st line treatment (Figure 3E).

CDK4, and cyclin A in consistent with a previous report
[23]. To ascertain whether FOXO4 affects CSC properties
of B cell lymphoma, the amplification of FOXO4 expression
increased colony forming ability whereas the knockdown
of FOXO4 decreased colony formation in BJAB cell line
(Figure 5A). Likewise, BJAB cell with the knockdown
of FOXO4 showed a significant decrease of stem cellassociated genes, OCT4, NANOG, and SOCS2 (Figure 5B).
Phosphorylated AKT level was decreased in BJAB-PB cells
with FOXO4 overexpression whereas siFOXO4-transfected
BJAB-PB cells showed the reverse of phosphorylated AKT
representing the association of downregulated FOXO4
expression with the phosphorylation of AKT (Figure 5C).
The sphere formation was not detectable in parental BJAB
cells or clones with low FOXO4 expression, however, the
sphere formation was markedly increased in the BJAB
clone overexpressing FOXO4 (Figure 5D, 5E).

Effect of FOXO4 on stem cell properties of
treatment-surviving cells
The expression of FOXO4 target proteins (p21,
p27, and SOD2) was increased in BJAB-PB and Raji-PB
cells compared with control cells (Figure 4A, 4B). On the
other hand, the expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins
(cyclin D1, CDK4, and cyclin A) was reduced in BJAB-PB
and Raji-PB cells where FOXO4 expression was increased
(Figure 4C, 4D). These results represent FOXO4 could upregulate the expression of p21, p27, and SOD2 whereas
FOXO4 down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1,

Prognostic value of FOXO4 protein expression in
DLBCL patients

categorized into FOXO4-low group. Overall, 37 patients
(18%, 37/211) were classified as FOXO4-high group.
FOXO4-high group was significantly associated with
unfavorable characteristics, including advanced stage and
increased extranodal involvement (P < 0.05, Table 1).
Thus, the high-intermediate/high-risk group of patients
according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI)
showed more strong association with FOXO4-high group
(32%, 15/47) than the low/low-intermediate risk group
(13%, 22/164, P = 0.008). Accordingly, the OS and PFS of
patients were significantly different according to positivity
for FOXO4 (Figure 5G, P < 0.05).

In total, 211 patients with DLBCL subjected to
at least one cycle of chemotherapy with curative intent
were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic value of FOXO4
protein expression. The median age of patients was
59 years (19–86 years). The characteristics of patients
at diagnosis are summarized in Table 1. FOXO4-high
group was defined as DLBCL cases with more than 70%
of positively stained nuclei of tumor cells (Figure 5F).
Although the optimal cutoff is not established for nuclear
staining of FOXO4, we applied the strict definition for
FOXO4-high group because some cases displaying weak
nuclear positivity for FOXO4 or cytoplasmic staining
in molarity of cells might increase the false positive
rate. Thus, all cases other than FOXO4-high group were

fraction that survived after high-dose drug treatment. This
subset of lymphoma cells survived after treatment with
high-dose doxorubicin and phenylbutyrate exhibited stem
cell-like properties compared to the untreated parental cell
population including the expression of stem cell markers,
colony and sphere forming activity and resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents. Because phenylbutyrate was
reported to induce pluripotency-associated genes [15], this
small population of lymphoma cells might be enriched
with cells having stem cell-like properties (so-called
CSCs). The presence of CSCs in tumor cells have been
demonstrated by the application of ALDH assay and sidepopulation analysis based on characteristics of normal stem
cells such as high expression of adenosine triphosphatebinding cassette transporters protecting against cytotoxic
agents [19–21]. Our study also showed higher proportion
of ALDH-positive cells and side-population in this subset
of cells survived after the treatment with IC90 dose of
phenylbutyrate than control cells (Figure 2E, 2F). Taken
together, these findings were consistent with that the small
subset of cells could have stem cell-like properties leading
to treatment failure in lymphomas.

Given this subset of cells having stem cell-like
properties was resistant to chemotherapeutic agents in
this study, the comparison of gene expression profiles
between treatment-surviving and untreated control
cells was performed to find a marker representing the
cell populations with drug resistance. Our comparison
revealed the increased expression of 41 genes in the four
different lymphoma cell lines (BJAB, Raji, Daudi, Toledo,
Figure 3A). These gene were commonly overexpressed in
doxorubicin- and phenylbutyrate-treated surviving cells.
Among them, we chose FOXO4 as a candidate gene for
indicating the cell fraction with stem cell-like properties
because previous studies have suggested the role of
FOXO transcription factors in the maintenance of stem
cell characteristics [16–18]. The increased expression
of FOXO4 was also demonstrated in other DLBCL cell
lines (OCI-Ly10, Riva, and U2932) when doxorubicinand phenylbutyrate-treated surviving cells were analyzed
(Supplementary Figure S3). Furthermore, primary cells
from refractory DLBCL patients showed increased
expression of FOXO4 compared to that of patient with
complete response (Figure 3E). These results might

support the association of FOXO4 expressing cells with
CSCs leading to drug resistance. Thus, overexpression
of FOXO4 might have a potential role as a predictor of
treatment failure in DLBCL.
The FOXO family transcription factors consisting of
four members, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6,
are reported to have various roles in the regulation of
stress response and oncogenesis [24]. Previous studies
reported that FOXOs protect cells under stress conditions
(e.g., oxidative stress, serum deprivation or hypoxia) and
contribute to cancer progression. Thus, FOXOs were
reported to promote invasion and metastasis of colon and
breast cancers [25–27]. FOXOs also could contribute to
the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells in chronic
myeloid leukemia [17, 18, 28]. Likewise, the depletion of
FOXOs could induce leukemic cell maturation and cell
death in acute myeloid leukemia [16]. In our experiments,
expression levels of FOXO4 and its transcriptional targets
(p21, p27 and SOD2) were low or undetectable in untreated
control cells but highly upregulated in treatment-surviving
cells. Additionally, FOXO4 expression led to enhanced
transcription of stem cell factors and self-renewal activity
of lymphoma cells whereas its knockdown had opposite
effects. The major mechanism of FOXO regulation is
associated with phosphorylation by Akt and other kinases
[29]. Phosphorylation of FOXO factors lead to their
nuclear export and abrogation of transcriptional activity.
Accordingly, we analyzed the association of FOXO4www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

positive cells with treatment failure using an archived
tumor tissue array of DLBCL patients. In our study, the
survival outcome of FOXO4-high group was significantly
worse than that of FOXO4-low group (Figure 5G).
In conclusion, a small subset of lymphoma cells
surviving treatment with doxorubicin or phenylbutyrate
showed stem cell-like properties including the expression of
stem cell markers, increased colony and sphere formation and
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The overexpression
of FOXO4 was found in these surviving cells, and DLBCL
patients with FOXO4-positive tumor cells had poor
prognosis. Thus, our results might suggest a role of FOXO4
as an indicator for the presence of cell population enriched
with CSCs leading to drug resistance and treatment failure.

Daudi and Toledo) were seeded at a density of 5 × 106
cells per 150 mm dish and incubated with 300 nM
doxorubicin or 8 mM phenylbutyrate for 48 h. For the
negative control, the same cell lines were incubated with
DPBS for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by cell
counting using a hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific,
Horsham, PA, USA) after staining with 0.4% Trypan
blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO, USA).
Viable cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria™ III cell
sorter, and total RNA extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and amplified using the
TargetAmp-Nano Labeling Kit for Illumina Expression
BeadChip (EPICENTRE, Madison). Labeled RNA
samples were prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina, Inc., San Diego), and array signals
detected with Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3
(GE Healthcare Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Raw
data were extracted using the software provided by the
manufacturer (Illumina GenomeStudio v2011. 1 (Gene
Expression Module v1.9.0)). Array probes with detection
p-values ≥ 0.05 (similar to signal-to-noise) in over 50%
samples were filtered out. We applied a filtering criterion
for data analysis. Thus, a higher signal value was required
to obtain a detection p-value < 0.05. The selected gene
signal value was transformed by the logarithm and
normalized with the quantile method. The statistical
significance of expression data was determined based on
fold change. Gene Enrichment and Functional Annotation
analyses were performed with DAVID (http://david.

differentially expressed genes were conducted using R

analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSverse, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA).

Reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For reverse transcription, 2 µg
RNA was converted to cDNA using an Omniscript RT
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The generated cDNA
was amplified using specific primers, with glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal
normalization control. Each PCR cycle consisted of
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, primer annealing at 58°C
for 30 sec, and extension at 72°C for 30 sec. Sample
was amplified for 35 cycles, and an additional extension
step carried out at 72°C for 5 min. The specific primer
sequences were as follows: FOXO4 forward, 5′- TGG
GCT CAA TCT CAC CTC TTC C -3′ and FOXO4
reverse, 5′- AGA AGC ACC CTT CTC CTG CTG A -3′;
NANOG forward, 5′-AAA GAA TCT TCA CCT ATG CC3′ and NANOG reverse, 5′-GAA GGA AGA GGA GAG
ACA GT-3′; OCT4 forward, 5′-CGA CCA TCT GCC GCT
TTG AG-3′ and OCT4 reverse, 5′-CCC CCT GTC CCC
CAT TCC TA-3′; SOX2 forward, 5′- CCT CCG GGA CAT
GAT CAG -3′ and SOX2 reverse, 5′- TTC TCC CCC CTC
CAG TTC -3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-ACA GTC AGC CGC
ATC TTC TT -3′ AND GAPDH REVERSE, 5′- GAC
AAG CTT CCC GTT CTC AG -3′.

Cell survival and colony formation assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 per well in
24-well plates and incubated with 0–1 μM doxorubicin,
0–3 μM prednisolone for 24 h and 0–100 ug/ml rituximab
for 72 h. After this period, cells were stained with 0.4%
trypan blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) and counted
using a hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham,
PA). Data were expressed as percentage cell proliferation,
taking the number of living cells incubated with DPBS as
100% reference. For colony formation, cells were seeded
in triplicate at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well in sixwell plates. The base agar was 0.3% agar containing RPMI
1640 with 10% FBS while the top agar was 0.6% agar in
the same culture medium. A 2 ml aliquot of medium was
added, and the plates incubated at 37°C. Colonies were
counted after 2 weeks.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) primers for FOXO4, Nanog, OCT4, SOX2 and
β-actin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays, Austin, TX), and reactions
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Side population analysis
The cells were suspended at 1 × 106 cells of
RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS and 10 mM
HEPES buffer and incubated with Hoechst 33342 dye

Reactions were carried out in an ABI7900HT system, and
the results expressed as fold change calculated with the
ΔΔCt method relative to the control sample. β-Actin was
used as the internal normalization control.

FOXO4-Flag overexpression constructs were
generated as follows: FOXO4 cDNA was obtained from
Addgene (plasmid 17549) and subcloned into a pCMV
tag4C vector to generate pCMV tag4C FOXO4-Flag.
BJAB was transfected with pCMV tag4C FOXO4Flag or empty vector using the Amaxa Nucleofector™
kit T and the corresponding Amaxa Nucleofector™
System (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Stable cell lines
overexpressing FOXO4 were selected with changes of
fresh medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) for 4 weeks.
FOXO4-targeting and control siRNA were purchased from
Dharmacon (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).

on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 4 μm thick tissue
sections. Tissue sections were deparaffinized three times
in xylene for a total of 15 min, and antigen retrieval
performed for 20 min with ER1 buffer (pH 6.0) in 97°C.
After endogenous peroxidase blocking for 5 min, tissues
were incubated with primary polyclonal antibody against
FOXO4 (1:1000; GTX50500; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA)
for 15 min using a BOND-MAX autoimmunostainer
(Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia) for 15 min. The
secondary antibody reaction was performed using a BONDMAX autoimmunostainer (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne,
Australia) with the BOND Polymer Refine Detection system
(DS9800; Vision BioSystems, Melbourne, Australia) for 10
min. Positivity for FOXO4 was determined by comparing
with the normal positive control from the tonsillar germinal
center. In every staining set, a negative control was included
in which primary antibodies and probes were omitted.
Stained slides were reviewed, and the extent of tissue
expression determined by pathologists (M.H. and Y.H.K).

Western blot

Statistical analysis

Whole cell lysates were prepared using ice-cold
RIPA buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet
P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate [SDS] and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride [PMSF]) and cleared by microcentrifugation
(14 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C). The protein concentration
in each sample was estimated with the BCA Assay. In
total, 30–40 μg protein sample was electrophoresed
on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and
electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After
1 h of incubation in blocking solution (5% non-fat milk),
membranes were exposed overnight at 4°C to primary
antibodies, included those against FOXO4, pAKT, AKT
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), p27 (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA), p21, cyclin D1, cyclin A, CDK4 and β-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa. Cruz, CA, USA). The
blot was washed with TBST buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5],
150 mM NaCl. 0.05% Tween 20) and further exposed to
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL).

Categorical variables were analyzed with Fisher’s
exact test. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated
from the date of diagnosis to the first day of progression,
relapse or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was
calculated from the date of diagnosis to death. Survival curves
were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. P values < 0.05 were considered
significant, and two-sided tests used in all calculations.
Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM PASW
version 18.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
