Abstract
The emergence of tumor resistance to conventional microtubule-targeting drugs restricts their clinical use.
Using a cell-based assay that recognizes microtubule polymerization status to screen for chemicals that interact
with regulators of microtubule dynamics, we identiﬁed Pyr1, a cell permeable inhibitor of LIM kinase, which is the
enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the actin-depolymerizing factor coﬁlin. Pyr1 reversibly stabilized
microtubules, blocked actin microﬁlament dynamics, inhibited cell motility in vitro and showed anticancer
properties in vivo, in the absence of major side effects. Pyr1 inhibition of LIM kinase caused a microtubulestabilizing effect, which was independent of any direct effects on the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Pyr1
retained its activity in multidrug-resistant cancer cells that were resistant to conventional microtubuletargeting agents. Our ﬁndings suggest that LIM kinase functions as a signaling node that controls both actin
and microtubule dynamics. LIM kinase may therefore represent a targetable enzyme for cancer treatment.

Introduction
Microtubules are ﬁlaments composed of a-tubulin and
b-tubulin heterodimers. They are highly dynamic polymers,
and their dynamics is tightly regulated by a balance between
activities of microtubules-stabilizing and microtubule-destabilizing proteins (1–3).
Moreover, the interaction of the microtubule growing tips
with some proteins such as CLIP 170 results in microtubule
stabilization (4, 5). The binding of all of these proteins to
tubulin is tightly regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes (6, 7) or, directly, by tubulin modiﬁcations
such as the tubulin tyrosination cycle (8, 9).

A detailed knowledge of the different players and how they
interact both spatially and temporally to regulate microtubule
functions is, however, still lacking.
Because of microtubules key role in mitosis, microtubuletargeting agents are powerful anticancer drugs. Tubulin is now
considered as one of the most highly validated cancer target
(10, 11). These drugs have, however, some limitations due to
side effects, principally myelosuppression and neurotoxicity.
Moreover, many cancers are, or become, resistant to these
drugs (12). This is often the result of multidrug resistance
caused by overexpression of ATP-binding cassette transporters
(13). Several strategies have been proposed for the development of more effective and less toxic anticancer drugs. One of

them is to identify drugs targeting proteins that regulate
microtubule functions and that would lead to mitotic arrest
and/or apoptosis.
The aim of this study was to identify chemical compounds
able to interact with regulators of microtubule dynamics. We
therefore conducted a screening using a cell-based assay that
probes the microtubule polymerization status (14). We identiﬁed a compound (Pyr1) that slows down microtubule dynamics. Pyr1 is toxic for cancerous cell lines, including drugresistant cell lines. Pilot studies on mice with xenografted
tumors indicate that Pyr1 prevented tumor growth and was
well tolerated. Pyr1 also affected the actin cytoskeleton and
inhibited cell motility. We have identiﬁed LIM kinases (LIMK)
as the main targets of Pyr1. The activity of LIMK1/2 is
regulated mainly by the Rho-dependent kinases ROCK1
(15) and ROCK2 (16) and the p21-activated kinases PAK1
(17) and PAK4 (18) and inactivated mainly by the slingshot
phosphatases (19). Phosphorylation and inhibition of the
actin-depolymerizing protein coﬁlin by LIMKs is the last step
of a cascade that regulates actin polymerization. Here, we
show that Pyr1 inhibits coﬁlin phosphorylation. We established that the microtubule-stabilizing effect of Pyr1 results
from its inhibitory effect on LIMKs and is independent of its
effect on the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, LIMK inhibition by
Pyr1 explains the observed phenotypes on both actin and
tubulin.

Materials and Methods
Screen for chemical modulators of microtubule
dynamics
The screen was conducted as described in the work of Vassal
and colleagues (14). For a summarized description, see the
Supplementary Methods.
Chemical reagents, recombinant and puriﬁed proteins,
plasmids, antibodies, and cell lines
All reagents used are indicated in the Supplementary
Methods.
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
To visualize microtubules, cells were seeded either on glass
coverslips or in microplates (ViewPlate-96, Perkin-Elmer Inc.).
They were permeabilized in warm OPT buffer (80 mmol/L
Pipes, 1 mol/L EGTA 1 mol/L MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and
10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and ﬁxed for 6 minutes in 20 C
methanol. To visualize F-actin, cells were washed in warm
PBS and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 37 C,
followed by cell permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in
PBS. After incubation with primary antibodies, cells were
incubated with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)
or Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies. To visualize Factin, Alexa 488-phalloidin (Invitrogen) was included with the
secondary antibody.
Images were captured either with a charge-coupled device
camera (CoolSNAP ES; Roper Scientiﬁc) in a straight microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i) controlled by Nikon software (Universal Imaging Corp.) using a 40, 60, or 100 Plan-Neoﬂuar

oil objectives, with an IN Cell Analyzer 1000 automated microscope (GE-Healthcare) using a 40 objective, controlled by IN
Cell software allowing automated cell imaging or with an Orca
R2 N/B camera (Hamamatsu) in a straight microscope (Zeiss
AxioImager Z1) controlled by Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss)
using a 63 oil objective. When necessary, cells were observed
with a confocal microscope (Leica).
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of growing microtubules
þ ends
HeLa cells were incubated for 2 hours with the tested
compound, ﬁxed for 6 minutes in 20 C methanol, and
processed for immunoﬂuorescence using anti-EB1–speciﬁc
antibody.
Tubulin polymerization assay
Microtubule polymerization assay was adapted from the
work of Bonne and colleagues (20). Brieﬂy, microtubule assembly was carried out in a half-area, 96-well black plate (Greiner,
#675090) using a microplate reader FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG
Labtechnologies). Wells were charged with either microtubule
proteins or pure tubulin (ﬁnal concentration of 25 and 30
mmol/L, respectively) in MEM buffer with 10 mmol/L 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and variable concentrations
of compounds. Following 10-minute incubation, assembly was
started by injection of GTP and MgCl2 to a ﬁnal concentration
of 1 and 5 mmol/L, respectively, in 100 mL. The excitation and
emission wavelengths were set at 360 and 450 nm, respectively, and the ﬂuorescence of microtubule-bound DAPI was
monitored as a function of time at 37 C. Fluorescence signal
at time 0 was subtracted from each of the subsequent
ﬂuorescence readings. Each compound was assayed in
triplicate.
Actin-pyrene polymerization assay
Mg-ATP-monomeric actin (2 mmol/L, 10% pyrene labeled) in
MME buffer containing 0.2 mmol/L ATP was polymerized at
room temperature after addition of one-tenth volume of 10
buffer (500 mmol/L KCl, 20 mmol/ MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA,
100 mmol/L imidazole, pH 7.5). Experiments were carried out
in the presence or absence of different compounds, as indicated in the ﬁgure legend. The polymerization was followed by
changes in pyrene ﬂuorescence using a Xenius SAFAS ﬂuorimeter (Safas SA).
Tumor xenograft experiments
Twelve B6D2F1 female mice were injected subcutaneously
in the right ﬂank with 2  106 L1210 cells. Mice were then
randomly separated into 2 groups of 6 mice each. In one group,
Pyr1 (10 mg/kg/d in PEG400) was injected intraperitoneally, on
the left ﬂank, daily for 10 days. In the other group, PEG400 alone
was injected, daily for 10 days. Each day, the mice were
observed for survival. They were weighted twice a week. The
experiment was stopped 20 days after the last vehicle-treated
mice death. The ethics committee of Lyon University (Lyon,
France) validated this experimental protocol.
All the other experimental procedures are described in the
Supplementary Methods.

Anticancer Properties of a New LIM Kinase Inhibitor

Results
Hits selection process
The screening assay is based on the properties of the
tubulin enzymes involved in the tubulin tyrosination cycle,
tubulin tyrosine ligase, and tubulin carboxypeptidase.
Because of their substrate properties, dynamic microtubules
are composed of tyrosinated tubulin (Tyr-tubulin), whereas
stabilized microtubules are composed of detyrosinated tubulin (Detyr-tubulin; ref. 21). Thus depolymerization or stabilization of the microtubule network can be distinguished by
double immunoﬂuorescence using speciﬁc Tyr- and Detyrtubulin antibodies (14). We selected 16 compounds that
enhance the Detyr-tubulin signal by 20%. After checking the
compounds structure, only 5 chemically nonreactive compounds that generate stable Detyr-microtubules in cells
were selected for further characterization (Supplementary
Table S1).
It is well established that sodium azide can stabilize
microtubules, thus generating Detyr-tubulin (22). To
eliminate compounds acting via similar mechanisms, we
analyzed compounds effects on mitochondria and discarded compounds targeting mitochondria as did sodium
azide (Supplementary Table S1). We also eliminated
compounds with no analogues, leaving one remaining
compound, 9-benzoyloxy-5,11-dimethyl-2H,6H-pyrido[4,3b]carbazol-1-one, (Pyr1; Fig. 1A). Incubation of HeLa cells
with 25 mmol/L of Pyr1 resulted in Detyr-microtubules
generation (Fig. 1B).

Pyr1 suppresses microtubule dynamic instability
without directly targeting tubulin
To check whether the enrichment of Detyr-microtubules
results from an effect on the tubulin tyrosination enzymes or
from an effect on microtubules dynamics, we ﬁrst studied the
resistance of the microtubule network to nocodazole-induced
depolymerization. Nocodazole binds free tubulin and prevents
its incorporation into microtubules, inducing microtubule
depolymerization. Microtubules with slow dynamics have
reduced exchanges with the free tubulin pool and are thus
less sensitive to nocodazole-induced depolymerization (23).
We found that a pretreatment of cells with Pyr1 protects the
microtubule network from nocodazole-induced depolymerization (Fig. 2A). We next examined the distribution of the plusend tracking protein (þTIP) EB1 (end binding protein 1) that
speciﬁcally probes growing microtubule plus ends. Cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 5 mmol/L paclitaxel, or 10
and 25 mmol/L Pyr1 were stained with an anti-EB1–speciﬁc
antibody (Fig. 2B). We observed a decrease of the number of
EB1 comets per cell in paclitaxel-treated cells (92% reduction
of the number of EB1 comets) as well as in cells treated
with Pyr1 (84% reduction of the number of EB1 comets for
25 mmol/L Pyr1), together with a size reduction of remaining
EB1 comets (45% and 27% reduction of the comets surface for
5 mmol/L paclitaxel and 25 mmol/L Pyr1, respectively), suggesting a strong reduction of microtubule growth dynamics
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
We then analyzed the effect of Pyr1 on microtubule dynamic
instability parameters, using time lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy on GFP-EB3–transfected cells (ref. 24; Supplementary
Movie S1). As expected, Pyr1 suppressed the microtubule
growth rate, strongly reduced the microtubule growth length
as indicated by the dose-dependent increase of the distancebased catastrophe frequency, and increased time spent in
pause. Such effects have been previously described for microtubule-stabilizing agents (ref. 25; Supplementary Table S2).
Taken together, these experiments clearly show that Pyr1
suppresses microtubule dynamics instability.
Close analysis of the morphology of the mitotic spindles
revealed that the spindles of cells treated with the compound
were abnormal, with disorganized asters. We found that 84.2%
of the mitotic spindles were normal in DMSO-treated cells and
12.8% abnormal, whereas 9.7% of the mitotic spindles were
normal in Pyr1-treated cells and 82.9% were abnormal. These
defects were clearly different from the multiple asters observed
in cells treated with paclitaxel. Spindles depolymerize in
nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 2C).
As agents interfering with microtubule dynamics lead to
a G2–M cell-cycle arrest, we analyzed Pyr1 effect on the cell
cycle, by ﬂow cytometry. Although Pyr1 effect was not as
strong as that of nocodazole or paclitaxel, we found that it
induced a cell-cycle arrest at the S- to G2–M phases (Fig. 2D).
To test whether Pyr1 directly interacts with tubulin, we
assayed it in an in vitro tubulin assembly. Paclitaxel is a wellcharacterized microtubule-stabilizing agent that can induce
in vitro tubulin assembly at low tubulin concentrations that
would not induce spontaneous tubulin assembly. We found
that Pyr1 could not induce in vitro tubulin assembly, neither

when assayed on tubulin in the presence of associated protein
(microtubule proteins, Fig. 2E) nor on pure tubulin (Fig. 2F).
This experiment strongly suggests that Pyr1 does not interact
directly with tubulin.
Pyr1 overcomes drug-resistant cell phenotype
Because Pyr1 was able to stabilize microtubules, with a
mechanism of action different to that of taxanes, we tested

4432

whether it could be of therapeutic interest. We ﬁrst examined
its toxicity on several cancerous cell lines, including drugresistant cell lines overexpressing the glycoprotein P or transporters such as ABCG2 and MRP1 that renders cells insensitive
to current chemotherapies.
Pyr1 reduced the viability of these cell lines in a dosedependent manner, with a GI50 (50% of growth inhibition) in
the micromolar range (Table 1).

Pyr1 is well tolerated in mice and shows anticancer
activity
The core structure of Pyr1 is similar to that of ellipticine, an
alkaloid with proven antineoplastic activity, through DNA
intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. The ellipticine
derivative N2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticium has been used in
the treatment of breast cancer, but it has been retrieved
because of its toxicity. Previous studies have shown that Pyr1
is a weak DNA intercalator and has no effect on topoisomerase
II (26).
To determine whether Pyr1 could serve as chemotherapeutic agent, we examined its toxicity in mice. Mice received daily
intraperitoneal injections of Pyr1 (from 15 to 60 mg/kg), during
7 days. Transient signs of discomfort related to administration
of the vehicle were observed in all animals (Supplementary
Table S3). The weights of Pyr1-treated animals and vehicletreated animals were not signiﬁcantly different (Supplementary Table S4). Hematologic parameters were normal after Pyr1
treatment. The only small changes observed for the highest
doses were not considered as having signiﬁcant toxicity (Supplementary Table S5). After treatment period, a full postmortem examination was conducted. Yellow foci on the liver for
mice that received high dose of Pyr1 were observed, which
correlated with acute to subacute peritoneal inﬂammation
seen in the hepatic capsule (data not shown) but without signs
of severe hepatic damage. Thus, under these experimental
conditions, no severe adverse effects related to Pyr1 administration were observed up to the dose of 30 mg/kg/d, indicating
that Pyr1 is well tolerated.
We then conducted a pilot study using an in vivo model of
leukemia L1210-bearing mice of the B6D2F1strain. The
injected dose of Pyr1 was chosen to be 3 times lower than
the dose (30 mg/kg/d) for which the ﬁrst adverse signs were

www.aacrjournals.org

detected. Vehicle-treated mice were all dead at day 70, whereas
all the Pyr1-treated mice survived (Fig. 3) and were still alive
20 days later, when the experiment was stopped. Thus, Pyr1
induced a complete survival gain (P < 0.002) with no apparent
toxicity (no loss of weight, data not shown).
These experiments indicate that Pyr1 has a good therapeutic
efﬁcacy and is well tolerated.
Pyr1 affects the organization of F-actin but does not
directly target it
We then tried to identify Pyr1 cellular targets. As the
microtubule and actin microﬁlament networks are highly
interconnected (27), we investigated the effect of Pyr1 on the
actin cytoskeleton. Cells treated with Pyr1 were stained for
ﬁlamentous actin (F-actin) using ﬂuorescein-phalloidin. Pyr1
affected the organization of the actin microﬁlaments, which
was not observed when cells were exposed to paclitaxel
(Fig. 4A).

Interestingly, Pyr1 toxicity is the same for the drug-sensitive

Time (min)

Because of the central role of actin dynamics in cell motility,
we examined the effect of Pyr1 on MCF10A cells motility, using
time lapse video microscopy. We found that Pyr1 rapidly and
completely blocked cell motility, even at the lowest concentration assayed (10 mmol/L; Fig. 4B).
Pyr1 was not able to directly affect actin assembly in vitro
and could not modify actin assembly kinetics, contrary to
phalloidin that can stabilize F-actin in vitro and to latrunculin
B that inhibits actin assembly (Fig. 4C). These results indicate
that Pyr1 does not directly interact with actin.
We have also tested the possibility that the effect of Pyr1
on F-actin inﬂuences microtubule dynamics, which could
indirectly result in the stabilization of microtubules. We
thus pretreated cells with cytochalasin D, which depolymerizes F-actin (28), and examined Pyr1 effect on microtubule dynamics (Supplementary Fig. S2). We observed that
even when the microﬁlaments are completely depolymerized, Pyr1 still induces the formation of Detyr-microtubules,
indicating that the microtubule network is stabilized. This
result strongly suggests that Pyr1-induced microtubule stabilization is independent of the inhibitor effect on the actin
network.
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that Pyr1 targets
regulators of actin as well as tubulin.

Pyr1 selectively inhibits LIM kinases activity
Previous screening identiﬁed a class of Pyr1 structurally
related compounds that often targets protein kinases (26, 29).
We therefore tested the ability of Pyr1 to inhibit the activity of a
panel of 66 protein kinases known to be involved in the
regulation of the cytoskeleton. Pyr1 inhibited only the activities
of a member of NIMA-related kinase family (NEK11), mixed
lineage kinase 1 (MLK1), and LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1; Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Table S6). The highest inhibition was observed
for LIMK1, which showed only 4% residual in vitro kinase
activity. A well-established substrate of LIMK1 is coﬁlin, a
protein that regulates actin dynamics. Using coﬁlin as substrate, we found that Pyr1 inhibited the activity of recombinant
LIMK1 and LIMK2 (Fig. 5B C) in vitro with an IC50 of 50 and
75 nmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3a). The inhibitor
behaved as an ATP competitor (Supplementary Fig. S3b).
As selectivity is a major issue for ATP-competitive kinase
inhibitors, we extended the evaluation of the compound on the
activity of 45 additional different kinases, using a thermal
stability shift assay (30). We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant interaction
of the identiﬁed inhibitor with any of the screened kinases
except LIMK1, which showed a Tm shift of 8.16 C, consisted
with the high potency of this inhibitor (Supplementary
Table S7).

Figure 5. LIM kinase is a target of Pyr1. A, inhibitory effect of Pyr1 on the kinase activity of a panel of 66 kinases including LIMK1. The data are expressed
as the percentage of the activity determined in the absence of inhibitor. B and C, Pyr1 inhibits the phosphorylation of GST-coﬁlin by GST-LIMK1 (B)
or GST-LIMK2 (C). Increasing concentrations of Pyr1 were incubated with kinase assay mix. Phosphorylated proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by autoradiography (top) and Coomassie blue staining (bottom). GST-LIMK1 autophosphorylation is also abrogated in presence of Pyr1. D, inhibition
of LIMK1-mediated GST-p25 phosphorylation by Pyr1. Increasing concentrations of Pyr1 were incubated with kinase assay mix. Phosphorylated
proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (top) and Coomassie blue staining (bottom). E, effect of Pyr1 on coﬁlin
phosphorylation in cells. HeLa cells were treated for 2 hours with increasing concentrations of Pyr1, as indicated. Cells lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE
and transferred for immunoblotting with anti-phospho-coﬁlin (Ser3) or coﬁlin as indicated.

Another substrate of LIMK1 is p25 (31). We investigated the
ability of Pyr1 to inhibit the in vitro phosphorylation of bacterially expressed and puriﬁed human GST-p25 by recombinant LIMK1. Although the phosphorylation of GST-p25 was not
efﬁcient in control conditions, we found that Pyr1 inhibits it
(Fig. 5D).
To ascertain that Pyr1 can also inhibit LIMK activity in cells,
we examined the level of phospho-coﬁlin (p-coﬁlin) in cells
treated for 2 hours with different concentrations of Pyr1. The
level of p-coﬁlin was greatly reduced with increasing amounts
of Pyr1, whereas the protein levels of coﬁlin were not affected. A
complete inhibition of coﬁlin phosphorylation was observed
after incubation of cells with 25 mmol/L of Pyr1 (Fig. 5E). This
concentration was chosen to determine the time course of Pyr1
effect in cells. Complete inhibition of coﬁlin phosphorylation
was observed 20 minutes after addition of Pyr1 (Supplementary Fig. S3c).
We also investigated whether the inhibition of LIMK1
activity by Pyr1 was reversible in vitro and in cells. To achieve
this, the kinase activity of a LIMK1-Pyr1 mix was assayed
before and after size exclusion chromatography, allowing the
potential separation of the kinase from unbound inhibitor.
After gel ﬁltration, a signiﬁcant increase in LIMK activity was

www.aacrjournals.org

observed (Supplementary Fig. S3d). Western blot analysis of
protein lysates prepared from cells ﬁrst treated with Pyr1 and
then re-incubated in fresh medium without Pyr1 showed that
coﬁlin phosphorylation was again detectable 30 minutes after
Pyr1 washout and reached basal levels after 2 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3e). These results clearly show that Pyr1 binding
to LIMK is reversible.
Similarly, the suppression of microtubule dynamic instability by Pyr1 observed in HeLa cells was also found reversible
(Supplementary Table S8).
We also checked whether Pyr1 inhibits NEK11 and MLK1
activities. In vitro, Pyr1 has weak activity on both NEK11 and
MLK1 (Supplementary Fig. S4a and S4b). Pyr1 effect was also
checked in cells. NEK11 is known to destabilize Cdc25A (32)
and a downstream target of MLK1 is Jun kinase. Looking on
Cdc25 expression and on the phosphorylation status of Jun
kinase, respectively, we found that Pyr1 has no effect on the
activity of neither NEK11 nor MLK1 (Supplementary Fig. S4c
and S4d).
LIMK inhibition causes microtubule stabilization
The identiﬁcation of LIMK1/2 as targets of Pyr1 strongly
suggested that the inhibition of coﬁlin phosphorylation is the

mechanism that underlies the actin network reorganization
and the loss of cell motility of cells treated with Pyr1. The link
between LIMK inhibition and the observed microtubule stabilization is, however, less obvious. To investigate this issue, we
compared the potency of several Pyr1 structural analogues to
inhibit LIMK1 activity in vitro (Supplementary Table S9), to
modify actin microﬁlaments dynamics, as assessed by the
resistance of Pyr1-induced actin structures to latrunculin
depolymerization, to induce the generation of Detyr-microtubules (Supplementary Fig. S5a), and to inhibit coﬁlin

found a good correlation between the levels of LIMK1 inhibition by the tested compounds and the stabilization of both the
actin structures and the microtubules. These experiments also
allowed the determination of Pyr1 structure–activity relationships (Supplementary Table S9). In another experiment,
we tested whether (N-[5-[2,6-dichloro-phenyl]-5-diﬂuoromethyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]thiazol-2-yl)-isobutyramide, a recently
described LIMK inhibitor (33, 34), also called LIMKi (Fig. 6A),
was able to stabilize microtubules. We showed that LIMKi was

indeed able to increase the Detyr-microtubules cell content
(Fig. 6B) and to stabilize them to a nocodazole-induced
depolymerization (data not shown). These results indicate
that an LIMK inhibitor structurally different from Pyr1 is also
able to induce a stabilization of the microtubule network.
We then tested whether the overexpression of LIMK1 could
counteract the microtubule-stabilizing effect of Pyr1. Cells
overexpressing LIMK1 (Fig. 6C) were treated with increasing
concentrations of Pyr1 and microtubule stability was then
probed with nocodazole, as described above. We found that at
all the concentrations assayed, the microtubule network of the
LIMK1-expressing cells treated with Pyr1 was less stabilized, as
compared with control cells (Fig. 6D).
Finally, we analyzed the effect of LIMK invalidation on
microtubule stabilization, as assessed by the generation of
Detyr-microtubules. We invalidated LIMK1 and LIMK2 into
MCF7 cells and found that LIMK invalidation not only
decreases coﬁlin phosphorylation but also increases Detyrtubulin content (Supplementary Fig. S6). We found that LIMK
expression, especially that of LIMK2, was more difﬁcult to
silence into HeLa cells. We succeeded, however, using short
hairpin RNA lentivirus, to diminish LIMK1 expression in such
cells. In these conditions, we found a large amount of cells with
Detyr-microtubules, indicating that microtubules are stabilized (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Taken together, our results show that speciﬁc inhibition of
LIMK activity by the small-molecule inhibitor Pyr1 is responsible of its effects on the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin and actin.

Discussion
Our strategy based on a screening of a chemical library led to
the discovery of a cell-permeable inhibitor of LIMK1/2,
enzymes known to phosphorylate and inactivate coﬁlin, an
actin-depolymerizing factor. As the readout of the assay used
for the library screening was the immunoﬂuorescence detection of a tubulin modiﬁcation indicative of the cellular microtubule stability status, it was somewhat surprising that this
approach led to the identiﬁcation of an inhibitor of a known
actin regulator. However, such a whole-cell–based assay
probes for inhibitors of entire pathways, allowing the cell
biology to dictate the best targets (35). Using cytochalasin
D, an actin-depolymerizing agent, we showed that the effect of
Pyr1 on microtubules was independent of its induced actin
cytoskeleton reorganization. Thus, this screening approach
allowed the selection of a chemical compound able to target
LIMKs, a shared signaling regulation node of the actin and the
microtubule cytoskeletons.
Because of the ability of Pyr1 to suppress microtubules
dynamic instability, we tested whether it has antimitotic and
cytotoxic properties on cancer cell lines. We found that this
was the case. Moreover, Pyr1 had the same toxicity for the
drug-sensitive human cell lines and for their multidrug-resistant counterparts. This suggests that Pyr1 may be used as an
alternative or in addition to standard chemotherapy, in drugresistant tumors. Our pilot study conducted on tumors xenografts in mice indicated that Pyr1 was indeed able to prevent
tumor growth at doses that are well tolerated by the animals.

www.aacrjournals.org

Moreover, because it is active at doses much lower than the
doses where the ﬁrst signs of toxicity appear, Pyr1 has a
convenient therapeutic window.
Although we found a close correlation between LIMK inhibition, actin disorganization, and microtubule stability, the
mechanism by which Pyr1 induces microtubule stabilization is
not completely understood. It was shown that phosphorylation
of p25 by LIMK1 inhibits its ability to polymerize microtubules,
resulting in reduced levels of stable microtubules (31). Therefore, a Pyr1-induced dephosphorylation of p25 could be
responsible of the observed stabilization of microtubules. We
cannot, however, rule out the possibility that Pyr1-induced
microtubule stabilization results from an effect of Pyr1 on
other targets.
The mitotic spindles of cells treated with Pyr1 show a
disorganization of astral microtubules. This phenotype is
similar to that obtained by Kaji and colleagues after LIMK1
knockdown (36), further supporting our conclusion that the
LIMKs are the main cellular targets of Pyr1.
Pyr1 induced rapid and almost complete coﬁlin dephosphorylation in vitro and in cells. This indicates that the basal
activity of coﬁlin phosphatases (slingshot and chronophin)
must be high in the cells tested and that Pyr1 may also target
closely related coﬁlin kinases, that is, TESK.
Pyr1 acts as an ATP-competitive inhibitor of LIMK. A major
concern in the use of kinase inhibitors that are ATP antagonist
is their target speciﬁcity, as the ATP-binding motif is present in
all kinases as well as in other proteins. We therefore tested the
ability of Pyr1 to inhibit the in vitro activity of 110 protein
kinases, and although it is possible that Pyr1 targets other
kinases such as TESK, than the ones already assayed, it shows,
however, a high selectivity. The kinases assayed include some
vital kinases such as the insulin receptor kinase. The absence of
Pyr1 effect on these kinases could contribute to the observed
limited animal toxicity of the compound.
It is anticipated that inhibition of coﬁlin phosphorylation
that results in activation of coﬁlin would lead to actin severing
and depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments. After 2 hours of
treatment with Pyr1, we observed a complete disorganization
of the actin microﬁlament network with decreased level of Factin. This phenotype was not previously observed when
LIMK1 and LIMK2 were knocked down by speciﬁc siRNA
(33). A possible explanation of this disparity is that there are
major differences between the mechanism of action of siRNA
and pharmacologic inhibitors. Indeed, in addition to differences in kinetics, siRNA experiments reduce protein levels,
whereas a small molecule only inhibits protein enzymatic
activity. Moreover, LIMKs contain protein–protein interaction
domains. They, thus, may have a variety of yet uncharacterized
functions, in addition to their enzymatic activity. These other
functions might be involved in the observed reorganization of
the actin network.
One major advantage of small molecules, particularly when
their effect is reversible, as is the case for Pyr1, is that they allow
high temporal and spatial control. Their effects can be observed
in real time by live cell imaging. To date only 2 cell-permeable
inhibitors of LIMK have been described with limited experimental data about their speciﬁcity (33, 34, 37, 38). Moreover,

LIMK is the last node in the signaling pathway that regulates the
actin and the microtubule cytoskeletons. Thus, Pyr1, with its
high speciﬁcity, is a new reagent that can be added to the biologist toolbox for dissecting cytoskeleton-dependent mechanisms and to investigate the effect of acute and chronic inhibition
of LIMKs, on different cells and organisms.
We have shown that LIMK inhibition totally blocks in vitro
cell migration. It has been recently shown, using siRNA or a
small-molecule inhibitor, that the activity of LIMK1/2 is
required for invasive path generation by tumor and tumorassociated stromal cells (33). In contrast to our results, the
authors found that LIMK inhibition did not affect cell motility.
This disparity can be explained by the differences in the cell
lines studied. The activity of coﬁlin kinases and coﬁlin phosphatases may vary among different cells. Yet, small changes in
the coﬁlin phosphorylation state may have a great impact on
the cell invasiveness (33). Differences in the afﬁnity for LIMKs
or in the selectivity of the 2 inhibitors could also explain their
different effects on cell motility.
Nevertheless, the coﬁlin pathway (39) including its upstream
effectors ROCK, PAK, and LIMK (40–43) was proposed as a
validated target for the treatment of cancer metastasis. Hence,
in addition to its use in basic research and possibly its
therapeutic use as an alternative antimitotic compound in
the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant tumors, Pyr1 has the
potential to be used for the inhibition of cancer metastasis.
