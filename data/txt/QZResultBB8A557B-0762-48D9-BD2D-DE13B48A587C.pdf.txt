Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint
blockade or adoptive T-cell transfer, can lead to durable
responses in the clinic, but response rates remain low due
to undeﬁned suppression mechanisms. Solid tumors are
characterized by a highly acidic microenvironment that might
blunt the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. In this study,
we directly investigated the effects of tumor acidity on the
efﬁcacy of immunotherapy. An acidic pH environment
blocked T-cell activation and limited glycolysis in vitro. IFNg
release blocked by acidic pH did not occur at the level of
steady-state mRNA, implying that the effect of acidity was
posttranslational. Acidiﬁcation did not affect cytoplasmic pH,

Introduction
The amplitude and quality of T-cell activation in response to
antigen activation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) is tightly controlled
by the engagement of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, Lag-3,
Tim-3, BTLA, and CTLA4. The ability of tumors to coopt these
inhibitory pathways plays an important role in the inhibition of
T-cell responses within the tumor microenvironment (1, 2).
Treatment with fully humanized neutralizing mAbs against
CTLA4, PD-1, or its ligand PD-L1 has led to durable antitumor
responses where conventional therapies have failed (3–5).
However, response rates remain low, from 18% to 27% for
anti-PD-1 antibodies (6) and 11% for anti-CTLA4 antibodies
(7). Recent studies have shown that multiple checkpoints can
be coexpressed on individual tumor–inﬁltrating lymphocytes,
such as PD-1þTIM-3þ T cells, which are defective in proliferation and cytokine production (8–10). Indeed, a recent clinical
trial combined PD-1 and CTLA4 blockade in patients with
melanoma and showed an increase rate of objective tumor

suggesting that signals transduced by external acidity were
likely mediated by speciﬁc acid-sensing receptors, four of which
are expressed by T cells. Notably, neutralizing tumor acidity with
bicarbonate monotherapy impaired the growth of some cancer
types in mice where it was associated with increased T-cell
inﬁltration. Furthermore, combining bicarbonate therapy with
anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1, or adoptive T-cell transfer improved antitumor responses in multiple models, including cures in some
subjects. Overall, our ﬁndings show how raising intratumoral pH
through oral buffers therapy can improve responses to immunotherapy, with the potential for immediate clinical translation.

responses as compared with blocking either checkpoint
alone, 40% versus 20% (11). However, there remain a significant proportion of nonresponders, suggesting that additional
immunosuppressive pathways are active.
Regulatory T cells (Treg) or myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) are also known to blunt T-cell responses (12, 13).
Tregs suppress antigen-speciﬁc T-cell response, and the removal
of Tregs in murine models led to enhanced antitumor T-cell
responses and tumor rejection (14). MDSCs are comprised of
immature macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DC;
ref. 15). They suppress T-cell responses, reduce antigen-speciﬁc
CD8þ T-cell proliferation, and increase T-cell death by apoptosis (16), and their elimination has been shown to enhance
antitumor immunity and tumor regression in murine tumor
models (17). In addition to these cell-based inhibitors of
immune function, there are also secreted factors that block
T-cell activation. The most widely studied of these are the
kynurenines, which are synthesized by the tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO can
be expressed by cancer cells and is normally expressed by DCs
in response to IFNg to blunt immune activation (18). There has
also been evidence that tumor-derived acidity also plays a role
in immunosuppression (19).
Solid tumors are unequivocally acidic (20). This is commonly believed to be a consequence of high rates of fermentative
metabolism in a poorly perfused environment (21). However,
newer models point to an active role for the membrane-bound
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) in establishing extracellular
acidity (22). This is relevant, as CAIX is an independent negative prognostic indicator in a number of cancers, including,
inter alia, breast (23), lung (24), and ovarian cancers (25).

Pilon-Thomas et al.

Tumor acidity is important to tumor progression, as it has been
shown to promote local invasion and metastasis (26), and
metastasis can be inhibited by neutralization of acidity with
oral buffers (27, 28).
Tumor-derived acidity is also hypothesized to suppress
immune function (19). For example, lactic acidosis is a strong
negative prognostic indicator in sepsis (29). In vitro, acidic pH
(6.5) can suppress T-cell functions, including IL2 secretion and
the activation of T-cell receptors (30), although the mechanism by
which this occurs is not known. Likewise, there is evidence that
acid pH affects other components of the immune system, such as
DCs, MDSCs, or macrophages, yet these effects are also not known
with certainty (19). For example, inhibition of proton pumps on
tumor cells with omeprazole can hamper tumor-induced suppression of macrophages in vitro and in vivo (31, 32), yet this
activity may be due to off-target effects, as the target for these drugs
are not known to be expressed in the immune system. It may be
assumed that the effects of acidity are not mediated via acidiﬁcation of the intracellular pH (pHi), as the pHi has been shown to
be highly buffered in activated T cells (33). More recently, families
of speciﬁc acid–sensing receptors have been identiﬁed (34) and
shown to transduce extracellular acidity into intracellular signals.
For example, acid pH has been shown to activate the G-protein, Tcell inhibitory receptor, T-cell death–associated gene-8 (TDAG8;
ref. 35), and this has been shown to be responsible for a reduction
in c-myc translation in lymphocytes (36). In this study, we
examined the effect of tumor acidity on antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies and observed that the neutralization of tumor
pH with bicarbonate increased response to checkpoint inhibitors
and, importantly, led to cures in combination with adoptive T-cell
therapy.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from
Harlan Laboratories. TDAG8 knockout (TDAG8 KO) mice on the
C57BL/6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Pmel, OT-I, and OT-II mice were bred and housed at the
Animal Research Facility of the H. Lee Mofﬁtt Cancer Center and
Research Institute (Tampa, FL). Mice were humanely euthanized
by CO2 inhalation according to the American Veterinary Medical
Association Guidelines. Mice were observed daily and were
humanely euthanized if a solitary subcutaneous tumor exceeded
200 cm2 in area or mice showed signs referable to metastatic
cancer. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance
with the U.S. Public Health Service Policy and National Research
Council Guidelines.
Cell lines and cell culture
B16 melanoma (obtained from ATCC), Yumm 1.1 melanoma (kindly provided by Marcus Bosenberg, Yale University,
New Haven, CT), and Panc02 pancreatic cancer (a kind gift
from Emmanual Zervos, East Carolina University, Greenville,
NC) cell lines were cultured in complete media (CM):
RPMI media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS,
0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 2 mmol/L fresh L-glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 0.5 mg/mL
fungizone (all from Life Technologies), and 0.05 mmol/L 2-ME

(Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma
contamination. All cell lines were passaged less than 10 times
after initial revival from frozen stocks. All cell lines were
validated in core facilities prior to use.
In vitro T-cell culture
T cells were isolated from the spleens of pmel, OT-I, or OTII mice using T-cell columns (R&D Systems). Pmel T cells
were cultured for 2 days in CM, containing 10 IU/mL IL2 and
5 mg/mL gp10025-33 peptide. T cells were collected and cultured in
CM, pH 6.6 or 7.4, with gp10025-33 peptide (10 mcg/mL) for 24
hours. Freshly isolated OT-I T cells were cultured in CM, pH 6.6 or
7.4, with OVASIINFEKL peptide (10 mcg/mL) for 24 hours. Freshly
isolated OT-II T cells were cultured in CM, pH 6.6 or 7.4, with
OVA323-339 peptide (10 mcg/mL) for 24 hours. Freshly isolated T
cell from TDAG8 KO and wild-type (WT) littermates were cultured with 5 mcg/mL plate-bound anti-CD3 antibodies for 48
hours. For restimulation experiments, pmel T cells were collected
after 24 hours of culture in CM, pH 6.6 or pH 7.4, containing 10
mcg/mL gp10025-33 peptide and recultured in CM, pH 7.4, with
10 mcg/mL gp10025-33 peptide for 24 to 48 hours. Cell supernatants were collected and IFNg production was measured by
ELISA. For measurement of IFNg production by ﬂow cytometry,
brefeldin A (1 mcg/mL) was added to the cell culture 4 hours prior
to harvest. Cells were harvested and stained with live/dead Aqua
(Invitrogen) to exclude dead cells. Surface staining was done with
anti-mouse CD8 APC antibody, followed by intracellular staining
with anti-mouse IFNg PE, and data were acquired on the LSR II
and analyzed using FlowJo software.
Treatment model
C57BL/6 mice received 200 mmol/L of sodium bicarbonate
water 3 days prior to tumor injection and continued to receive
bicarbonate water until the end of the experiment. Control mice
received regular tap water. A total of 1  105 B16, Yumm 1.1, or
Panc02 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in the left ﬂank
of C57BL/6 mice. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 20
mg/kg of anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies on day 3 and
continued to receive antibodies every 3 to 4 days until the end
of the experiment. Mice were humanely euthanized when tumors
exceeded 1.5 cm in diameter, appeared necrotic, or interfered with
locomotion. Tumors were collected and weighed.
Adoptive T-cell therapy
C57BL/6 mice received 200 mmol/L of sodium bicarbonate
water 3 days prior to tumor injection and continued to receive
bicarbonate water until the end of the experiment. Control mice
received regular tap water. A total of 1  105 B16 tumor cells were
injected subcutaneously in the left ﬂank of C57BL/6 mice. Three
days later, mice received a sublethal dose (600 cGy) of total body
irradiation (TBI) administered by an X-ray irradiator. For adoptive
transfer experiments, T cells were isolated from the spleens of
pmel mice and cultured in media containing 10 IU/mL of IL2 and
5 mg/mL of gp10025-33 in vitro for 5 days. On day 4 following
tumor injection, 5  106 T cells were intravenously injected. IL2
(2.5e5 IU) was given intraperitoneally following T-cell injection,
continuing every 12 hours for 3 days, for a total of 6 injections.
Following this treatment, tumor size was measured and recorded
every 2 days.

Flow cytometry
Spleens and tumors were harvested under sterile conditions.
Single-cell suspensions were prepared, and red blood cells
were removed using ACK lysis buffer. Tumor cell suspensions
were prepared from solid tumors by enzymatic digestion in
Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Life Technologies),
containing 1 mg/mL collagenase, 0.1 mg/mL DNAse I, and
2.5 U/mL of hyaluronidase (all from Sigma-Aldrich), with
constant stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. The resulting
suspension was passed through a 70-mm cell strainer and
washed once with HBSS. Cells were resuspended in PBS þ
3% BSA to a concentration of 0.5–1  106 cells/mL for ﬂow
cytometric analysis. After red blood cell lysis with ACK buffer,
cells were stained in FACS buffer with the following antibodies
for ﬂow cytometric analysis: CD3, CD4, and CD8 for T-cell
detection and CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C for MDSC detection (all
from BD Biosciences). Live/Dead ﬁxable near-IR or aqua ﬂuorescent reactive dyes (Invitrogen) were used to exclude dead
cells before analysis. Cells were acquired by LSR II equipped
with four lasers (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed
with FlowJo (Tree Star).
Intracellular pH measurement
Pmel T cells were cultured at pH 7.4 in the presence of
gp10025-33 peptide for 24 hours. Cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free media and SNARF-1, acetoxymethyl ester,
acetate (Life Technologies) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of

10 mmol/L. After 30-minute incubation, cells were split into two
aliquots that were washed two times with PBS at either pH 6.6 or
7.4. In the last wash, each of the two aliquots were again split into
two aliquots at each pH and resuspended in either regular PBS at
the respective pH or high-K PBS þ 10 mmol/L nigericin at the
respective pH. Samples were then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry with
laser excitation of approximately 543 nm and emissions at 540
and 680 nm. Ratios of ﬂuorescence emission intensities of SNARF1 at 580 and 640 nm, which are sensitive to pH, were then plotted.

qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Isolation Kit (Qiagen).
qRT-PCR was then carried out using iTaq Universal SYBR
Green One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad) using the primer sequence

T-cell characteristics. A, IFNg mRNA levels are unaffected by pH. Levels of IFNg mRNA in pmel T cells following a 48-hour stimulation at pH 7.4 and subsequent
incubation at pH 7.4 or 6.6 for a subsequent 24 hours. Data were normalized to ribosomal protein 36B4 and expressed as mean ratio  SD from three independent
experiments; B, pHi of activated T cells is unaffected by the incubation pH. Pmel T cells were activated as above and then incubated at pH 6.6 or 7.4 for
24 hours, after which they were loaded with SNARF-1, acetoxymethyl ester, acetate, washed, and resuspended in PBS (2,4) or high K/nigericin (1,3) at pH 6.6 (1,2) or
7.4 (3,4) and the 580/640 ﬂuorescence ratio subsequently determined by ﬂow cytometry. The ratio shows that the pHi values of cells in PBS at low and high pH were
both approximately 7.2, and the ratios in nigericin show pH calibration points. C, forskolin inhibits T-cell function. Activated pmel T cells were cultured with
DMSO or forskolin in the presence of gp100 peptide. After 24 hours, intracellular IFNg was measured by ﬂow cytometry. Data represent results from three separate
experiments, and P values were determined using two-tailed Student t test.

Statistical analyses
As indicated, unpaired Mann–Whitney or two-sided Student t
tests were used to compare between two treatment groups. All
statistical evaluations of data were performed using the GraphPad
Prism Software. Statistical signiﬁcance was achieved at P < 0.05.

Results
To investigate the effect of pH on T-cell activation in vitro, we
used CD8þ T cells isolated from pmel mice, which transgenically
express a TCR speciﬁc for the melanocyte-associated peptide,
gp10025-33. These T cells were cultured with gp10025-33 peptide
for 48 hours at neutral pH and then further incubated with
gp10025-33 peptide at acidic (6.6) or alkaline (7.4) pH for an
additional 24 or 48 hours. As shown in Fig. 1A, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the cell viability under acidic, compared
with alkaline, conditions. However, at the same time, we observed
a decrease in cell-associated IFNg (Fig. 1B). In subsequent studies,
we observed that the secretion of this cytokine was completely
abolished in T cells cultured under acidic conditions (Fig. 1C). The
effects of acidic pH were not due to irreversible effects on CD8þ
signaling, as T cells, exposed to pH 6.6 for 24 hours and then
shifted to pH 7.4 for 24 hours, regained the ability to secrete high
levels of IFNg (Fig. 1D). Identical results were observed when
CD8þ T cells isolated from OT-1 mice, which transgenically
express a TCR speciﬁc for the ovalbumin peptide (OVASIINFEKL),
were activated with OVASIINFEKL peptide at low pH (Fig. 1E). We

1384 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

also observed a decreased secretion of TNFa by pmel and OT-I T
cells cultured at pH 6.6 (data not shown). Although a similar effect
was observed in T cells isolated from OT-II mice, which are CD4þ
T cells speciﬁc for OVA323–339, it was not as dramatic due to a high
constitutive elaboration of IFNg from these T cells (Fig. 1F). The
suppression of IFNg was posttranscriptional, as the IFNg mRNA
levels were not signiﬁcantly different in activated pmel T cells
incubated at pH 6.6, compared with those at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2A). This
inhibition was also not mediated by changes in the pHi. Mammalian cells in general, and immune cells in particular, have
robust mechanisms that maintain a constant pHi when they are
exposed to an acidic extracellular pH (pHe; ref. 38). Indeed, it has
previously been shown that when lymphocytes in pHe 7.4 CM are
then exposed to pHe 6.7, the pHi decreases only from 7.3 to 7.15
(33). In this study, pHi of activated T cells was measured by ﬂow
cytometry using the pH-sensitive dye, SNARF-1. The ﬂuorescence
ratios of activated T cells at pH 7.4 and 6.6 were similar, indicating
that the pHi was not different, even after exposure to different pHe
values (Fig. 2B). One possibility is that the effects of acidic pHe on
CD8þ T-cell IFNg secretion were mediated via one or more acidsensing receptors (34), such as ASIC3, ASIC4, OGR1, and TDAG8,
which are all expressed in pmel CD8þ T cells (Table 2). Evidence
suggests that the effect is transduced via cAMP signaling (a TDAG8
target), as forskolin, a cAMP agonist, signiﬁcantly attenuated IFNg
production, even at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2C). Also, the effect does not
appear to be mediated via the PI3K pathway (an OGR1 target), as
inhibition of PI3K failed to rescue IFNg production at low pH and,

indeed, led to a general inhibition at all pHs (Supplementary Fig.
S1). A known function of cAMP-activated protein kinase-A is to
inhibit glycolysis. We observed that activated pmel T cells at low
pH had high oxygen consumption rates and low glucose-stimulated acidiﬁcation rates compared with cells cultured at high pH
(Fig. 3). A similar effect was observed in OT-I T cells stimulated
with OVASIINFEKL peptide (Supplementary Fig. S2). Unstimulated
T cells are not metabolically active, and there is no effect of low pH
(data not shown). This reduction of glycolysis may be consistent
with the observed sequestration of IFNg mRNA in cells with
low glycolytic rates (39). To investigate the acid sensor, TDAG8,
in more detail, T cells were isolated from TDAG8 KO or WT
mice and stimulated in the presence of anti-CD3 antibodies for
48 hours at pH 6.6 or 7.4. In both TDAG8 KO and WT T cells,
IFNg production was abolished at pH 6.6 (Supplementary Fig.
S3). This suggests that TDAG8 alone is not responsible for the

extracellular sensing of acidity in T cells. Investigations into this
and other acid-sensing receptors are ongoing to determine
whether inhibition alone or in combination is effective in
rescuing the phenotype at low pH.
In vivo, the acidic pHe of tumors can be increased by providing
mice with 200 mmol/L ad lib sodium bicarbonate in drinking
water (Fig. 4A). In numerous previous studies, this effect was
shown to be speciﬁcally caused by buffering the pH of tumors, as it
does not cause systemic alkalization nor is it due to the additional
sodium load. These results were consistent with prior work in
animal models where oral buffers that raise tumor pH were shown
to inhibit spontaneous and experimental metastases (27, 40–42).
In prior studies, bicarbonate has shown little to no effect on the
growth rate of primary human tumor xenografts, neither in
immunodeﬁcient mice nor in fast-growing and aggressive B16
melanoma tumors in immunocompetent mice (28). However, in
a transgenic (TRAMP) model of prostate cancer, bicarbonate
therapy was shown to impair tumor development and subsequent
metastases (41). In this study, as before, bicarbonate therapy had
no effect on the growth rate of B16 tumors in immunocompetent
C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4B). However, there were signiﬁcant (P <
0.01) effects of bicarbonate monotherapy on the growth of Yumm
1.1 melanoma (Fig. 4C and D). Notably, bicarbonate therapy led
to signiﬁcant increases in CD8þ T-cell inﬁltrates into the Yumm
1.1 tumor (Fig. 4E). Bicarbonate monotherapy had no effect on Tcell inﬁltration into B16 tumors (data not shown), consistent with

Buffer monotherapy in vivo. Animals bearing syngeneic melanoma tumors were treated with or without 200 mmol/L ad lib sodium bicarbonate (Bicarb) in their
drinking water. A, bicarbonate raises pHe. The pHe levels were measured with microelectrode in B16 tumors treated with or without 200 mmol/L sodium bicarbonate
therapy. Four separate animals were investigated under each condition, and a minimum of four measurements were made in each tumor along a single
needle track (P < 0.001). B, bicarbonate does not affect B16 tumor growth. Mice bearing B16 tumors were treated with or without buffer therapy, showing no effect on
tumor growth (n ¼ 8 mice/group). C, bicarbonate inhibits Yumm 1.1 tumor growth. Mice bearing Yumm 1.1 tumors were treated with or without buffer therapy,

B7 and PD-L1/L2 ligands are ligands expressed by antigenpresenting cells that inhibit T-cell activation by binding to
cognate checkpoint receptors CTLA4 and PD1, respectively,
(43, 44), that are expressed on CD8þ cytotoxic T cells. Neutralizing antibodies against CTLA4 and PD1 are being used
clinically to prolong antitumor T-cell responses, and, in trials
to date, response rates in melanoma range from 18% to 35%
(6, 7). Given the inhibitory effect of acidosis on T cells and the
reversal of acidosis with buffers, we therefore assessed if
bicarbonate would augment antitumor responses in combination with anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 antibody therapy. We
observed that combinations of bicarbonate therapy with
anti-CTLA4 (Fig. 5A and B) or anti-PD1 (Fig. 5C and D)
antibodies signiﬁcantly improved the antitumor effects of
these therapies in the B16 melanoma model that was resistant
to bicarbonate alone. Although the effects on tumor growth
appear modest, the morphologies of the tumors were dramatically affected by bicarbonate, in that they were macroscopically more vascularized, compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4). This was not a systemic effect, as there were no
differences in splenic T-cell responses induced by bicarbonate
in combination with PD-1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). In
patients, anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibody therapies are
being increasingly used in combination. When these agents
were combined, there were only modest effects of adding

1386 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

bicarbonate therapy (Fig. 5E), likely because the combination
of these checkpoint inhibitors was by itself so effective. Notably, bicarbonate in combination with either checkpoint inhibitor was as effective in suppressing tumor growth as the twocheckpoint inhibitor combination (compare Fig. 5E with 5A
or 5C). Notably, the combination of bicarbonate with PD-1
checkpoint blockade was also effective in a Panc02 pancreatic
cancer model. In this system, treatment with bicarbonate or
anti-PD1 antibody alone had no effect on tumor growth,
whereas tumors treated with combination were signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.005) smaller (Fig. 5F).
Anticancer immunotherapy also includes the adoptive cell
transfer (ACT) of tumor-speciﬁc T cells. In ACT, syngeneic recipient mice bearing B16 melanomas were treated with 600 rad to
deplete peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 1 day later were
infused with 10 million activated pmel (Thy1.1) T cells and
subsequently treated twice a day with 250,000 IU of IL2 for 3
days. As expected, adoptive transfer alone caused signiﬁcant
reductions in the tumor growth rates, yet an improved antitumor
response was evident, albeit not signiﬁcantly, in combination
with bicarbonate (Fig. 6A). However, long-term follow up
showed that the combination of bicarbonate þ ACT led to a
long-term (censored at 120 day) survival rate of 40%, compared
with 10% for ACT with pmel T cells alone (Fig. 6B). Importantly,
the beneﬁcial effects of bicarbonate were associated with

biomarker for response to adoptive T-cell therapy (45).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that the acidic pH encountered in
a tumor microenvironment has signiﬁcant immunosuppressive
effects. In vitro, acidic pH was shown to profoundly inhibit T-cell
responses, including an abrogation of IFNg and TNFa secretion,
suggesting that an acidic environment may lead to a general block
of translation of proinﬂammatory cytokines. This does not appear
to be a general blockade of exocytosis, as the intracellular levels of
IFNg protein were likewise reduced and, indeed, low pH has been
shown to stimulate exocytosis in a number of systems (46). An
inhibition of glycolytic activation, which is necessary for T-cell
activation, was also observed. Additional studies will be required
to deﬁne the molecular mechanisms leading to the inhibition of
glycolytic activation by acidic pH in this system. This is a significant scientiﬁc problem as acid-induced inhibition of glycolysis is
known to occur in almost all systems, yet the signal transduction
events are unknown. In vivo, treatment of mice bearing melanoma
with bicarbonate therapy raised tumor pH and increased the
durable response rates to both checkpoint inhibition (PD-1 and

www.aacrjournals.org

CTLA4) and adoptive cell therapy. In prior work, we have shown
that buffer therapy induces "compensated metabolic alkalosis"
and works by buffering the tumor pH to more neutral values,
without affecting systemic pH (47).
We have calculated from these mouse studies that the human
equivalent dose would be bicarbonate at 800 mg kg1 d1. This
dose is clinically achievable, and early-phase I clinical trials of
bicarbonate therapy have been conducted. Buffer therapy directly
targets the tumor pH, but there are alternative pharmacologic
approaches that may indirectly lead to the same effect, i.e.,
compensated metabolic alkalosis, such as K-sparing diuretics
(furosemide) or pan-speciﬁc carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide). Other approaches could target the rate of tumor acid
production through either isoform-speciﬁc CAIX inhibitors (DH348) or inhibition of LDH-A (FX-11). The ability of these agents to
neutralize tumor pH is not known, nor are their effects on
antitumor immunotherapy.
Harold Dvorak famously characterized tumors as "wounds
that do not heal" (48). One component of the wound response
is a transient ischemia–driven tissue acidiﬁcation, which
resolves as the wound heals (49). The role of acidiﬁcation in
physiologic wound healing is not known with certainty, but
recent data suggest that acidiﬁcation stimulates the production

of inﬂammatory cytokines by the stroma or endothelium (50).
As these induce neoangiogenesis, the acidosis is reduced and
inﬂammation resolves. Our data and work cited herein would
suggest that, while acidiﬁcation may send an inﬂammatory
signal, T cells are unable to activate until the pHe becomes
more alkaline. In tumors, this acidiﬁcation never resolves, and
artiﬁcially raising the pH of tumors through buffer therapy
allows the "wound" to heal by promoting antitumor immunity.

Correction: Neutralization of Tumor Acidity
Improves Antitumor Responses to
Immunotherapy
In this article (Cancer Res 2016;76:1381–90), which appeared in the March 15, 2016,
issue of Cancer Research, there is an error in the Materials and Methods section. The
Panc02 cell line was not obtained from ATCC. It was a kind gift from Emmanual
Zervos (East Carolina University, Greenville, NC).
The online version of the article has been corrected and no longer matches the print.
The authors regret these errors.
