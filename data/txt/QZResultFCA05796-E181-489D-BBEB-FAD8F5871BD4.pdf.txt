Inflammation is an important feature of lung cancers. Alveolar
macrophages from lung cancer patients secrete more proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1h, after
lipopolysaccharide stimulation than those from persons with
nonmalignant disease (12). Increased IL-6 in lung cancer patients
enhances the acute phase response and is correlated with poor
nutritional status and lowered survival (13). Both ANP and NPRA
are expressed by lung cancer cells, and oversecretion of ANP has
been linked with hyponatremia (14–16). However, little is known
about the effects of NPRA signaling on inflammation and cancer
progression. In addition, metastatic melanoma cells produce higher
levels of cGMP in response to natriuretic peptides than other cell
types, and ANP may contribute to local inflammation in the origin
of metastatic melanoma (17). ANP possesses some topological
similarity with melanin-concentrating hormone (12). Furthermore,
the ANP gene, located on chromosome 1p36, is considered a
candidate gene for melanomas (18). In some cases, natriuretic
peptides including ANP have been reported to inhibit proliferation
of various cancer cells and tumor growth (19). Although the
mechanism of action is unclear, these peptides also decrease
expression of NPRA. However, a direct role for NPRA in
tumorigenesis has not been investigated thus far.
Previously, we reported that an NH2-terminal ANP prohormone
peptide comprising residues 73 to 102 (NP73-102) significantly
inhibits activation of several proinflammatory transcription factors,
including nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), activator protein 1 and Erk-1,2,
in human bronchial epithelial adenocarcinoma A549 cells (20, 21).
Because these transcription factors augment the local inflammatory
milieu, it was reasoned that NPRA signaling plays a role in and
promotes tumorigenesis. By corollary, blocking NPRA signaling
would attenuate tumorigenesis and development of cancers. In this
study, we tested tumorigenesis in mice that are deficient in NPRA
and those exhibiting attenuated expression of NPRA via treatment
with nanoparticles conjugated with siNPRA or pNP73-102. The
results show that NPRA attenuation or deficiency protects from
tumorigenesis in lung and ovarian cancers and melanomas by
several mechanisms, including decreasing local inflammation,
inducing the expression of tumor suppressive gene Rb, and blocking
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.

Abstract
The receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), natriuretic
peptide receptor A (NPRA), is expressed in cancer cells, and
natriuretic peptides have been implicated in cancers. However, the direct role of NPRA signaling in tumorigenesis
remains elusive. Here, we report that NPRA expression and
signaling is important for tumor growth. NPRA-deficient mice
showed significantly reduced antigen-induced pulmonary
inflammation. NPRA deficiency also substantially protected
C57BL/6 mice from lung, skin, and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, a nanoparticle-formulated interfering RNA for NPRA
attenuated B16 melanoma tumors in mice. Ectopic expression
of a plasmid encoding NP73-102, the NH2-terminal peptide of
the ANP prohormone, which down-regulates NPRA expression,
also suppressed lung metastasis of A549 cells in nude mice
and tumorigenesis of Line 1 cells in immunocompetent
BALB/c mice. The antitumor activity of NP73-102 was in part
attributed to apoptosis of tumor cells. Western blot and
immunohistochemistry staining indicated that the transcription factor, nuclear factor-KB, was inactivated, whereas the
level of tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein was upregulated in the lungs of NPRA-deficient mice. Furthermore,
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was downregulated in the lungs of NPRA-deficient mice compared with
that in wild-type mice. These results suggest that NPRA is
involved in tumor angiogenesis and represents a new target
for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):249–56]

Introduction
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), comprising the COOH-terminal
amino acid residues 99 to 126 of the ANP prohormone, has been
extensively studied for its functions in relation to blood pressure
regulation (1–8). Its receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor A
(NPRA), is expressed on cells in many different tissues of various
organ systems and signals through guanylyl cyclase. Both ANP and
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) signal through NPRA by increasing
cyclic guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP) and activating
cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Activated PKG in turn
up-regulates expression of genes encoding ion transporters and
transcription factors, which together affect cell growth, apoptosis,
proliferation, and inflammation (9–11).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The mouse Lewis lung carcinoma LLC1 cell line, B16F10.9
melanoma cells, the type II alveolar epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line
A549, and the normal human lung fibroblast cell line IMR 90 were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Human prostate cancer
cells PC3 and DU145 were kindly provided by Dr. Wenlong Bai in the
University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida; mouse ovarian cancer cell line,
ID8, was kindly provided by Dr. Janat-Amsbury (Baylor College of Medicine,
Waco, TX). Both A549 and IMR 90 were grown in Earle’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC in a 5%

selected for tumorigenesis experiments. B16 melanoma cells (1.5  105)
were injected s.c. into 12-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. The mice were
then given intranasal suspensions of 33 Ag of siNPRA oligos, siNPRA
plasmid, or scrambled oligos encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles at a
ratio of 1:2.5. In experiments to determine the efficacy of topical siNPRA,
chitosan nanoparticles containing siNPRA plasmid or oligos were mixed
with cream and applied to the injection area. Cream-containing siNPRA
nanoparticles was applied twice a week and the control group received
cream only. Mice were sacrificed on day 22 and tumors were removed and
weighed.
Apoptosis assays. A549 or normal IMR90 cells were grown in 6-well
plates and transfected with pVAX1 or pNP73-102. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were examined for apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and
poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage by Western blotting. In the
TUNEL assay, cell nuclei were stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) to enable counting of total cell numbers and determination of the
percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. For the PARP cleavage, whole-cell
protein was isolated and equal amounts were Western blotted using an
antibody to PARP. Experiments were done in duplicate.
Statistics. The number of mice used in each test group was a minimum
of 4 and usually 8 or 12. Experiments were repeated at least once, and
measurements were expressed as means F SE or SD. Comparisons of
groups were done using a two-tailed Student’s t test.

CO2 incubator. LLC1, ID8, and B16F10.9 cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS.
Animals. Female 8- to 10-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory. Female nude mice and C57BL/6 mice were from
National Cancer Institute. C57BL/6 NPRA / (deficient in natriuretic
peptide receptor A) mice were kindly provided by Dr. William Gower
(Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Tampa, Florida). All mice were maintained
in a pathogen-free environment and all procedures were reviewed and
approved by the University of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Plasmid constructs and transfection. All plasmids used in this study
were constructed using the pVAX expression vector (Invitrogen). The
pNP73-102 plasmid encodes the natriuretic peptide sequence, amino acids
73 to 102, of the atrial natriuretic prohormone NH2-terminal fragment. In
some experiments, the NP73-102 sequence was fused to the FLAG sequence
to allow antibody detection of NP73-120 expression in lung sections. An
anti-NPRA small interfering RNA plasmid (siNPRA) was constructed as
previously described. A549 cells were transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Preparation of plasmid nanoparticles and administration to mice.
Plasmids pNP73-102 and pVAX1 were encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles (25 Ag of plasmid plus 125 Ag of chitosan). Plasmids dissolved in
25 mmol/L Na2SO4 and chitosan (Vanson) dissolved in 25 mmol/L Na
acetate (pH 5.4; final concentration, 0.02%) were heated separately for
10 min at 55jC. After heating, the chitosan and DNA were mixed, vortexed
vigorously for 20 to 30 s, and stored at room temperature until use. Plasmid
nanoparticles were given to lightly anesthetized mice in the form of nose
drops in a volume of 50 AL, using a pipetter with the tip inserted into the
nostril.
Injection of mice with tumor cells. For s.c. challenge with LLC1, ID8,
and B16F10.9 cells, cells were grown in DMEM and washed with PBS and
then resuspended in PBS at 2  107 cells per mL for both LLC1 and ID8 or
at 3  106 cells per mL for B16F10.9. Two groups of mice (n = 8 or 12 per
group) were tested: wild-type C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 NPRA-deficient mice.
Animals were injected s.c. with 100 AL of suspended cancer cells in the right
flank. Tumor sizes were measured regularly, and the tumors were removed
and weighed at the end of experiment. For the A549/nude mouse model,
two groups of nude mice (n = 4 per group) were given 5  106 A549 cells by
i.v. injection and treated intranasally with 25 Ag of pNP73-102 or pVAX1
control nanoparticles weekly. Three weeks later, mice were sacrificed and
lung sections were stained with H&E and examined for tumor nodules.
Lung sections were also stained with antibodies to cyclin B and phosphoBad. For the Line 1/BALB/c mouse model, 25 Ag of pNP73-102 or pVAX1
control nanoparticles was injected i.p. into two groups of BALB/c mice
(n = 4 per group) on days 1 and 3. A week later, these mice were injected s.c.
with 105 Line 1 lung adenocarcinoma cells in the right flanks. Additional
treatment with pNP73-102 or pVAX1 nanoparticles was continued at weekly
intervals from week 2. A third group of four mice received only Line 1 cells
as control. In each set of experiments, the mice were sacrificed on day
40 and their tumor burden was determined based on tumor size (measured
by digital caliper) and weight.
Western blots. A549 cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis
buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 2.5 Ag/mL leupeptin, 0.5 mmol/L NaF, and 0.1 mmol/L sodium
vanadate to extract whole-cell protein. Fifty micrograms of protein was
separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. Western immunoblots were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibodies against NF-nB p65, phosphorylated NF-nB p65 (Ser536), and
phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were purchased from Cell
Signaling; antibodies against VEGF or NPRA were ordered from Santa Cruz
Biotechonology.
Knockdown of NPRA expression with siNPRA. Small interfering RNA
constructs that targeted the NPRA transcript were prepared and tested for
effectiveness by immunoblot for NPRA levels in cells transfected with the
vector-driven siNPRA (psiNPRA) plasmid. The siNPRA9 construct was

Results
NPRA deficiency decreases lung inflammation. To determine
whether the ANP-NPRA pathway contributes to pulmonary
inflammation, we compared the lungs of mice deficient in NPRA
(NPRA / ) with those of wild-type mice after immunization with
ovalbumin i.p. and subsequent challenge with ovalbumin intranasally. C57BL/6 wild-type mice (n = 8) showed substantially higher
inflammation, blocked airways, and goblet cell metaplasia than did
NPRA / mice (Fig. 1). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from
NPRA / mice had significant reduced levels of the inflammatory
cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 relative to those in wild-type mice
(data not shown).
NPRA deficiency protects mice against lung, skin, and
ovarian cancers. Recent research suggests that alterations in the
lung microenvironment caused by inflammation are related to
carcinogenesis (22). Proinflammatory conditions, especially those
related to chronic pulmonary irritation, may contribute to the
development of lung cancer (23). A direct link between inflammation and lung tumors can be seen in the particle-induced lung
cancer murine model (24). Integral to the involvement of
inflammation in the development of lung cancer is the profile of

Figure 1. NPRA expression and signaling is involved in lung inflammation.
NPRA / mice exhibit reduced lung inflammation. Wild-type C57BL/6 and
NPRA / mice (n = 4) were sensitized (i.p.) at day 0 and day 7 and then
challenged twice with ovalbumin. Two days later, mice were sacrificed and lung
sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin.

Figure 2. NPRA / mice are resistant to
tumorigenesis. A, NPRA is overexpressed
in various cancer cells compared with
normal cells. Whole proteins were
extracted from different cell lines and
subjected to Western blot using primary
antibodies against NPRA. B and C,
groups of wild-type and NPRA / mice
(n = 8 per group) were injected s.c. with
2  106 LLC1 cells. Tumor sizes (B) were
measured on day 10, 13, 15, and 17,
and tumor weights (C ) at day 17 were
compared (P < 0.01). D and E, groups of
wild-type and NPRA / mice (n = 12)
were injected s.c. with 2  106 B16
melanoma cells, tumor sizes (D ) were
measured on day 1, 10, 14, and 18, and
tumor weights (E) were measured and
compared at day 18 (P < 0.01). Data from
one of the two repeated experiments is
presented. F, groups of wild-type and
NPRA / mice (n = 8) were injected s.c.

cells and tumor sizes were measured

observed. Significant differences in tumor size and weight were
observed between the two groups (Fig. 2B and C). As a further test
of the antitumor effects of NPRA deficiency, mice were injected s.c.
with B16 melanoma cells. A significant reduction in mean tumor
volume, measured >18 days after B16 cell injection, and a
significant decrease in tumor weight at day 18 were observed in
NPRA / mice (n = 12) but not in wild-type mice (Fig. 2D and E).
The potential of NPRA deficiency to inhibit the growth of ovarian
cancer cells was also tested. Groups of wild-type (n = 8) and NPRAdeficient (n = 8) C57BL/6 mice were injected with 2  106 ID8
mouse ovarian cancer cells at day 1 and were monitored at weekly
intervals for tumor growth. By week 8 after cancer cell inoculation,
all mice from the wild-type group developed solid tumors, but no
tumors were observed in NPRA-deficient mice (Fig. 2F). Again
NPRA / mice exhibited a significant reduction in ovarian cancer
development compared with that in wild-type mice. These results
indicate that NPRA deficiency significantly protects mice from
tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
Inhibition of melanoma by siNPRA nanoparticles. To further
validate NPRA as a drug target for cancer therapy, we used siRNA
to knock down NPRA expression in C57BL/6 mice and tested their

cytokines produced (25). Because ANP-NPRA signaling is involved
in lung inflammation, we sought to investigate the role of the ANPNPRA signaling pathway in the development of cancers of the lung
and other organs. To illustrate the role of the ANP-NPRA signaling
pathway in cancer development, we compared NPRA expression in
various tumor cells and normal cells. We found that NPRA is
expressed at a higher level in all tumor cells, including cells of lung
carcinoma (A549 and LLC1), melanoma (B16), ovarian cancer
(SKOV3 and ID8), and prostate cancer cells (DU145), compared
with that in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether blockade of ANP signaling could have a
protective effect against development of cancer, various C57/BL6
murine models of tumorigenesis were evaluated. Using the
Lewis lung carcinoma model, C57BL/6 wild-type and NPRA /
mice (n = 8 for each group) were injected s.c. with 2  106 LLC1
cells in the right flank. Tumors appeared within 1 week after
injection, and tumor size was measured with a digital caliper
beginning on day 10. The tumors in wild-type mice grew rapidly
after day 10, but tumors in NPRA / mice gradually shrank. On day
17, all mice were sacrificed, and tumor sizes and weights were
measured. In one of the NPRA / mice, no visible tumors were

candidates and identified three that inhibited NPRA expression.
HEK293-GCA cells that overexpress NPRA were transfected with
one of these siNPRAs or with scrambled siNPRA (Scr), and cell
lysates were examined at 48 h for NPRA expression by Western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, siNPRA decreased NPRA expression
by about 60%. Because NPRA-deficient C57BL/6 mice may have
abnormalities that make them resistant to tumor development,
wild-type mice were injected with 3  105 B16F10.9 melanoma cells
and were then treated twice a week with a cream containing either
synthetic siNPRA, psiNPRA, or Scr, respectively, for four consecutive weeks at the site of tumor cell injection. Four weeks later,
tumor burden from each group was compared. A significant
reductions in tumor burden was seen in mice treated with siNPRA
(either with synthetic or psiNPRA) but not those given Scr (Fig. 3C),
indicating that siNPRA can be used to treat melanomas.
Suppression of lung cancer tumorigenesis by NP73-102
nanoparticles. NP73-102 decreases activation of several transcription factors, including NF-nB that promote tumorigenesis. To test
whether overexpression of NP73-102 affects NPRA expression
in vivo, pregnant mice were injected i.p. with pNP73-102 or pVAX1.
After 3 to 5 days, mice were sacrificed, and thymocytes were isolated
from embryos. NPRA or natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPRC)
levels were quantitated by flow cytometry with gating on CD4+ cells.
Expression of both NPRA and NPRC in embryonic thymi was
significantly reduced by pNP73-102 when compared with that in
control mice injected with pVAX1 (Fig. 4A). Because NPRA-deficient
mice had reduced tumorigenicity, it was reasoned that NP73-102
might have antitumor activity, and this was evaluated in vitro in
A549 cells using a soft agar assay. A549 cells were transfected with
pVAX1, pANP, or pNP73-102. The results from the soft agar assay
(data not shown) indicated that cells transfected with pNP73-102
exhibited significantly decreased colony formation compared with
that of nontransfected cells or cells transfected with pVAX1. To test
whether overexpression of a plasmid DNA encoding NP73-102 could
express the peptide in vivo in the lung, a pNP73-102-FLAG was
constructed, in which NP73-102 was fused to a FLAG epitope to
verify expression of NP73-102 in lung cells. The pNP73-102-FLAG,
encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles, was given to mice
intranasally, and 24 h later, a BAL was performed. BAL cells were
stained with anti-FLAG antibody, and substantial numbers of cells
expressing NP73-102-FLAG were observed (Fig. 4B).
To determine whether intranasal NP73-102 nanoparticle administration abrogates metastasis in mice, 12 nude mice were
separated into three groups (n = 4 per group). Mice were given
5  106 A549 cells i.v. and weekly instillations of PBS (control) or
nanoparticles carrying pNP73-102 or pVAX1. Three weeks later,
mice were sacrificed and lung sections were stained with H&E and
examined for lung nodules. Control animals receiving only PBS
showed nodules and tumors, whereas the NP73-102–treated group
had no tumors (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the lung sections were
stained with antibodies to promitotic cyclin B and to antiapoptotic
phospho-Bad (biomarkers of lung tumors), and mice treated with
NP73-102 did not show any staining for cyclin B or phospho-Bad
(Fig. 4D). To test whether NP73-102 nanoparticles could attenuate
tumor burden in an immunocompetent mouse lung cancer model,
BALB/c mice (4–6 week old female; n = 3 to 4 per group) were
given pNP73-102 (25 Ag/mouse; i.p.) on days 1 and 3 and then s.c.
injected with 105 Line 1 cells in the right flank on day 7. Thereafter,
mice were i.p. injected with pNP73-102 nanoparticles at weekly
intervals. The mice were sacrificed on day 40, and the size and
weight of tumors was measured. The results show that the tumor

we intratumorally injected chitosan-siGLO nanocomplexes into the
PC3-induced prostate tumors in BALB/c nude mice, and siGLO was
examined 48 h after injection. Fluorescence microscopy revealed
that siGLO was only present in tumors when delivered in
nanocomplexes but not when delivered in naked form (Fig. 3A).
To identify the most effective siRNA, we screened several

examined after 48 h by fluorescence microscopy. B, inhibition of NPRA
expression in HEK293-GCA cells by siNPRA. HEK293-GCA cells were
untreated, transfected with siNPRA, or with scrambled siRNA. Cells were
harvested 48 h after transfection. Total protein was extracted and subjected to
Western blot assay with primary antibody against NPRA. C, B16 melanoma cells
(1.5  105) were injected s.c. into 12-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice. These
mice were then treated with synthetic siNPRA, psiNPRA, or Scr. All of these were
mixed with chitosan at a ratio of 1:2.5. Mixed chitosan and plasmid or oligos were
mixed again with a cream before application to the injection area.
The control group was given cream only. These treatments were given twice a
week. Mice were sacrificed on day 22, and tumors were removed and
weighed. Points, mean; bars, SD; n = 16; P < 0.01.

inflammatory, in addition to antitumor, properties. To determine
whether apoptosis induction was the dominant explanation for the
antitumor activity of pNP73-102, we tested the effect of overexpressing pNP73-102 in B16 melanoma and normal NIH3T3 cells.
The results showed significant apoptosis of B16 cells as measured by
flow cytometry assay but not of the normal cells (data not shown).
Also, significantly more B16 cells were observed to be TUNELpositive when they were treated with pNP73-102 compared with the
number observed among cells treated with pVAX1 (Fig. 5C). These
results indicated that a decrease in ANP-NPRA signaling may result
in the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells.
NF-KB and pRb are involved in tumor suppression in NPRAdeficient mice. Activation of the NF-nB pathway enhances tumor
development and may act primarily during the late stages of
tumorigenesis. To determine whether the lungs of NPRA / mice
differ in NF-nB activation when compared with wild-type mice, we
examined the lung extracts for signs of NF-nB activation through
Western blot. Whole proteins were extracted from the lungs of
wild-type and NPRA / mice and then probed using primary
antibodies against p50, p65, phospho-p50, and phospho-p65. No
significant difference in NF-nB expression in the lungs was
observed between wild-type and NPRA / mice (Fig. 5D). However,
the level of the activated form of NF-nB, phospho-NF-nB (both

burden in pNP73-102–treated mice was significantly reduced
compared with the tumor burden in those treated with PBS or
pVAX1 control vector (Fig. 4E).
NP73-102 induces apoptosis of A549 adenocarcinoma and
B16 melanoma cells. To verify whether antitumor effects of
pNP73-102 can be attributed to loss of cell viability, A549 and
normal WI-138 cells were examined for apoptosis by TUNEL assay
after 24 h of transfection. The results indicated that f80% of A549
cells transfected with pNP73-102 underwent apoptosis compared
with only 10% of WI-138 cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, more A549 cells
were observed to be TUNEL-positive when treated with pNP73-102
than were observed among cells treated with pVAX1 (data not
shown). Apoptosis was further confirmed by examining for the
cleavage of the caspase 3 substrates, PARP, by Western blotting.
A549 cells transfected with pNP73-102 showed more cleaved PARP
than controls (Fig. 5B). A microarray analysis of gene expression of
A549 cells after transfection with either pVAX1 or pNP73-102 was
performed. The results showed that pNP73-102 significantly altered,
both positively and negatively, the expression of a number of genes
(data not shown). The up-regulated genes were predominantly from
the family of IFN-regulated genes or related signal transduction
pathways. Similarly, the down-regulated genes included some
involved in inflammation, suggesting that NP73-102 has anti-

phospho-p65 and phospho-p50), was decreased in NPRA / mice
(Fig. 5D). These results suggest that the role of NPRA in lung
inflammation may involve NF-nB activation.
We then tested whether pRb, the protein product of the
retinoblastoma cancer suppressor gene, is involved in the
suppression of tumor growth in NPRA / mice. pRb and other
retinoblastoma family members, such as pRb2/p130 and p107, are
involved in controlling four major cellular processes of growth
arrest, apoptosis, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Inactivation of
pRb has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis
of human cancers. We compared the expression of pRb in the lungs
of wild-type C57BL/6 and NPRA / mice by immunohistochemistry analysis. It was revealed that NPRA deficiency induced
overexpression of pRb (Fig. 5E). In addition, expression of VEGF,
which is important in angiogenesis, was decreased in the lungs of
NPRA-deficient mice, as observed by Western blotting (Fig. 5D).
The differential expression of pRb and VEGF may help to explain
why several types of cancer were inhibited in NPRA / mice but
not in wild-type mice. We also compared the expression of another
major tumor suppressor gene, p53, in the lungs of wild-type and

NPRA / mice through Western blot analysis, and no significant
difference was observed (data not shown).
Other mechanistic studies were performed to understand why
lung tumor growth was inhibited in NPRA / mice by comparing
gene expression in the lungs of wild-type and NPRA / mice.
Superarray analysis revealed that the expression of several genes,
such as hexokinase 2, glycogen synthase 1, and matrix metallopeptidase 10 were down-regulated from about 4- to 17-fold in the
lungs of NPRA / mice. Interestingly, the expression of cellular
retinol binding protein 1 was up-regulated about 5.5-fold in the
lungs of NPRA / mice.

Discussion
A significant finding of this study is the demonstration that
signaling through NPRA, which is the receptor for ANP and BNP,
plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. As a key signaling molecule,
NPRA produces the second messenger cGMP and activates PKG.
PKG activation in turn activates ion transporters and transcription
factors, which together affect cell growth and proliferation,

apoptosis, and inflammation. The finding that NPRA / mice
showed reduced lung inflammation indicates that ANP-NPRA
signaling is involved in the inflammatory process. These data are
supported by an observed decrease in eosinophil numbers and in
Th1-like and Th2-like cytokines in BAL fluid from NPRA / mice
compared with levels in wild-type mice (data not shown). These
results show that ANP-NPRA signaling promotes inflammation in
rodent models.
To test the hypothesis that the increased inflammation
contributes to the genesis of cancer, three different cancer models
were investigated in C57BL/6 wild-type mice and NPRA / mice.
These include the Lewis-lung carcinoma model, the B16-induced
melanoma model, and the ID8-induced spontaneous model for
ovarian cancer. In all these models, the NPRA / mice showed
little or no tumor growth compared with wild-type mice. ANP has
been reported to possess anticancer properties (19), and our data
are consistent with this because ANP overexpression is known
to decrease NPRA levels in cells (26) presumably by feedback
inhibition. Natriuretic peptides, such as KP and VD (27, 28), have
also been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and have
shown anticancer activities, although the mechanism of their
inhibition is not known. Because these peptides down-regulate
NPRA expression, it is likely that these peptides may also function
by regulating NPRA signaling; therefore, NPRA may be considered a
target for cancer treatment.
To further validate NPRA as a drug target for cancer therapy, we
used siRNA to knock down NPRA expression in immunocompetent
C57BL/6 mice. Plasmids were designed that induce degradation of
NPRA transcripts and block expression of NPRA. To protect the
siNPRA plasmid from degradation and to facilitate its entry into
tumor cells, the DNA was complexed with chitosan nanoparticles,
and this represents a significant improvement in the delivery of
siRNA to tumor cells. In a B16 melanoma model, mice treated with
siNPRA nanoparticles showed a significant reduction in tumors
compared with those of mice given Scr as a control. To further test
this approach, siNPRA was used to treat mice injected with ovarian
cancer cells. Again, the growth of the tumor xenograft was
inhibited significantly in these mice (data not shown). Treatment
with siNPRA, however, was not as complete as seen in NPRA /
mice; this could be because siRNA knockdown was not complete or
that a large enough dose of siNPRA was not used. Nonetheless,
these studies have confirmed the potential of using NPRA
inhibitors as an anticancer agent.
The finding that pNP73-102 inhibits NPRA expression prompted
us to examine its role in treating lung cancer using chitosan
nanoparticle–based intranasal gene therapy. A549 cells injected
into BALB/c nude mice induced lung micrometastasis in the
control mice but not in pNP73-102–treated mice. The location of
the lung tumors, as indicated by cyclin B and phospho-BAD
biomarkers, was in agreement with the tissue staining data. In
addition, tests of spontaneous lung tumorigenesis induced with
Line 1 cells in immunocompetent BALB/c mice showed that
treatment with pNP73-102 significantly reduced tumors compared
with those observed after treatment with pVAX vector alone. These
findings confirm the potential utility of pNP73-102 for the
treatment of lung cancers. Although the mechanism of tumor
inhibition by NP73-102 is unknown, the evidence that pNP73-102
significantly decreases the expression of NPRA suggests that this
may be the explanation for its antitumor effect.
Localized inflammation involving proinflammatory transcription
factors such as NF-nB has been implicated in the development of

cancers (29). Several groups have reported in mouse models of
intestinal (30), liver (31), and mammary (32) cancer that activation
of the NF-nB pathway enhances tumor development and may act
primarily in the late stages of tumorigenesis. Many tumor cell
lines show constitutive activation of NF-nB, but there has been
conflicting evidence as to whether it promotes or inhibits
tumorigenesis. Several groups have reported that activation of
the NF-nB pathway enhances tumor development and may act
primarily in the late stages of tumorigenesis in mouse models of
intestinal, liver, and mammary cancer. Inhibition of NF-nB
signaling uniformly suppressed tumor development but, depending
on the model studied, this salutary effect was attributed to an
increase in tumor cell apoptosis, reduced expression of tumor cell
growth factors supplied by surrounding stromal cells, or abrogation
of a tumor cell dedifferentiation program that is critical for tumor
invasion/metastasis (33–40). The demonstration that pNP73-102
inhibited activation of NF-nB and that NF-nB activation was
reduced in the lungs of NPRA / mice could represent another
additional mechanism underlying its anticancer activity. Moreover,
we observed less lung inflammation in NPRA / mice than was
observed in wild-type counterparts when they were challenged by
ovalbumin in an asthma model. The results presented here provide
evidence of a critical role for natriuretic peptides and NPRA
signaling in many different cancers, including lung cancer, ovarian
cancer, and melanoma. Interestingly, NF-nB binding activity was
4-fold greater in the nuclear extracts of NPRA / mouse hearts
than in those of wild-type mouse hearts (41). Reduced inflammation was also reported in the hearts of NPRA / mice (42). Further
investigation is needed to understand the differential regulation of
NF-nB activity and inflammation in the mouse lung and heart after
loss of the NPRA gene.
To identify the mechanism by which NPRA deficiency suppresses
the growth of several types of tumors, we analyzed the expression
of tumor suppressor genes, including p53 and pRb. Tumor
suppressor genes participate in a variety of critical and highly
conserved cell functions, including regulation of the cell cycle and
apoptosis, differentiation, surveillance of genomic integrity and
repair of DNA errors, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. The
p53 gene is the best known, but other tumor suppressor genes of
interest include the retinoblastoma gene (pRb), PTEN, p16, nm23,
and maspin (42). We found that there was no significant difference
in the level of p53 in the lungs of NPRA / and wild-type mice.
However, the phosphorylation of pRb was up-regulated in the lungs
of NPRA / mice, as indicated by Western blot assays. pRb plays a
critical role in the control of cell proliferation and in DNA damage
checkpoints and inhibits cell cycle progression through interactions with the E2F family of transcription factors. In tumorigenesis, loss of Rb function is an important event caused by gene
mutation, promoter hypermethylation, deregulation of Rb phosphorylation, and viral protein sequestration. Dysfunctional pRb has
been reported in many different types of tumors, including those of
the eye, bone, lung, breast, and genitourinary system. In our
investigation, we found that NPRA deficiency did not affect pRb
expression but did up-regulate pRb phosphorylation.
The Rb gene family is also involved in tumor angiogenesis (43).
Angiogenesis represents a fundamental step in tumor progression
and metastasis. The induction of vasculature is important for
tumor growth because it ensures an adequate supply of oxygen and
metabolites to the tumor. pRb regulates the expression of
proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, such as the VEGF,
through an E2F-dependent mechanism. Some natural and syn-

effective treatment for a wide range of cancers in the future.

thetic compounds show their antiangiogenic activity through a
mechanism of action involving pRb. Consistent with the activation
of pRb in the lungs of NPRA / mice, the expression of VEGF was
down-regulated in NPRA / mice when compared with that in
wild-type mice. This indicated that angiogenesis was attenuated in
NPRA / mice, which may contribute to the suppression of tumor
growth in NPRA / mice. Although we have only showed that the
differential expression of pRb and VEGF may play an important
role in the mechanism of tumor suppression in NPRA / mice (43),
additional studies are under way to determine which of the several
signal transduction pathways in which NPRA is involved are
important for the antitumor effect. Because clinical studies of the
natriuretic peptides have not indicated any incompatibility
reactions or toxic effects (44), we expect that combining the
