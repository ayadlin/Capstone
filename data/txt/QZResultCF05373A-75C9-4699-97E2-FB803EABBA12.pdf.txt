Abstract
Mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) belongs to a
family of dual protein kinases that are activated by either
extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinases in response to stress or mitogenic extracellular stimuli. The physiologic role of MSK1 in malignant transformation and cancer development is not well understood.
Here, we report that MSK1 is involved in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–induced or epidermal growth factor
(EGF)–induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells.
H89, a potent inhibitor of MSK1, strongly suppressed TPAinduced or EGF-induced cell transformation. When cells
overexpressing wild-type MSK1 were treated with TPA or
EGF, colony formation increased substantially compared
with untreated cells or cells that did not overexpress MSK1.
In contrast, MSK1 COOH terminal or NH2 terminal dead
dominant negative mutants dramatically suppressed cell
transformation. Introduction of small interfering RNA-MSK1
into JB6 Cl41 cells resulted in suppressed TPA-induced or EGFinduced cell transformation. In addition, cell proliferation
was inhibited in MSK1 knockdown cells compared with
MSK1 wild-type cells. In wild-type MSK1-overexpressing cells,
activator protein (AP-1) activation increased after TPA or
EGF stimulation, whereas AP-1 activation decreased in both
MSK1 dominant-negative mutants and in MSK1 knockdown
cells. Moreover, TPA-induced or EGF-induced phosphorylation
of histone H3 at Ser10 was increased in wild-type cells but the
induced phosphorylation was abolished in MSK1 dominantnegative mutant or MSK1 knockdown cells. Thus, MSK1 is
required for tumor promoter-induced cell transformation
through its phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and AP-1
activation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2538–47]

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are
required for many cellular functions, including growth, proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, apoptosis, and malignant
transformation (1–3). The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/
2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK signaling pathways are among the best
characterized of these intracellular protein kinase cascades (4).
Mitogen-activated and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) is a serine/
threonine protein kinase that is activated by either ERKs or p38

MAPKs in response to stress or mitogenic extracellular stimuli.
MSK1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of genes,
including the inflammatory gene interleukin-6 and immediate early
response genes, such as c-fos, c-jun, MAPK phosphatase-1 (mkp-1),
and nurr1 (5, 6). MSK1 has also been reported to phosphorylate
chromatin proteins histone H3 and high mobility group 14 (HMG14; ref. 7). Further, MSK1 phosphorylates various transcription
factors including cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element-binding
protein (cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)),
activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and the p65 subunit of
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; refs. 8–10). Recently, MSK1 was shown to
play a positive role in the control of cell proliferation of HaCaT
keratinocytes (11) and might play a role in pathogenesis of psoriasis
by regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines in
psoriatic epidermis (12). MSK1 was suggested to be activated in
response to tumor promoters, such as epidermal growth factor
(EGF), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or UVB (7, 13,
14). However, the role of MSK1 in tumorigenesis or cell
transformation is not completely clear.
Here, we used MSK1 dominant-negative or small interfering RNA
(siRNA)–MSK1 knockdown cells to show that MSK1 is involved in
TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells.
Results indicated that blocking MSK1 suppressed anchorageindependent transformation of JB6 cells through the inhibition of
both phosphorylation of histone H3 and AP-1 activation. Thus,
we showed that MSK1 is required for tumor promoter-induced cell
transformation.

University of Michigan; si-MOCK) was digested with XbaI and BbsI.
The annealed synthetic primers (primer 1, 5¶-TTTGAGACCTACTTCAGCGTCTCTTCAAGAGAGAGACGCTGAAGTAGGTCTTTTTT-3¶; primer
2, 5¶-CTAGAAAAAAGACCTACTTCAGCGTCTCTCTCTTGAAGAGACGCTGAAGTAGGTCT-3¶) were then introduced following the recommended
protocols found online.3 The recombinant plasmid of psi-MSK1 was
confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ,
Inc.). Stable JB6 Cl41 cells expressing pU6pro (si-MOCK) or si-MSK1 were
established with pcDNA3.1 as the selection marker. Transfected cells were
selected in medium containing 400 Ag/mL G418, and the expression level of
the MSK1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2(4-sulfonyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay. To estimate cell proliferation, stable
psi-MSK1 JB6 Cl41 cells (1  103) were seeded into 96-well plates in 100 AL
of 5% FBS/MEM and incubated at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. After
culturing for various periods of time, 20 AL of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One
Solution (Promega) were added to each well and cells were then incubated
for 1 h at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To stop the reaction, 25 AL of a 10%
SDS solution were added, and absorbance was measured at 492 and 690 nm.
Anchorage-independent cell transformation assay. TPA-induced or
EGF-induced cell transformation was investigated in JB6 Cl41 and MSK1
dominant-negative cells and psi-MSK1 stably transfected cells. In brief, cells
(8  103) were exposed to TPA (20 ng/mL) or EGF (10 ng/mL) in 1 mL of
0.3% Basal Medium Eagle (BME) agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures
were maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2 incubator for 10 d (EGF) or 12 d (TPA),
and cell colonies were scored using a microscope and the Image-Pro PLUS
(v.4) computer software program (Media Cybernetics).
Cell cycle analysis. psi-MOCK or psi-MSK1 stably transfected JB6 Cl41
cells (2  105) were seeded into 60-mm dishes and cultured for 24 h at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were harvested with trypsin, fixed with icecold methanol, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and then analyzed for
cell cycle phase by flow cytometry.
Reporter gene assays. For reporter gene assays, transient transfections
were carried out using jetPEI (Qbiogene) and cells were cotransfected
in triplicate with 250 ng of the AP-1 reporter gene and 50 ng of a
h-galactosidase (h-Gal)–expressing plasmid. The h-Gal–expressing plasmid
was cotransfected for normalizing the transfection efficiency. Routinely,
36 h after transfection, cells were washed and then starved 24 h in 0.1%
FBS/MEM, and cell lysates were then prepared 12 h after stimulation with
TPA (20 ng/mL) or EGF (10 ng/mL). Luciferase and h-Gal activities were
measured using the Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Electron) and Multiskan
MS (Labsystems), respectively.
Isolation of histone proteins. For the isolation of histone proteins,
cells (6  106) were homogenized in 0.5 mL nuclear preparation buffer
[10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.65% NP40, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] in the
presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 25 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate). Nuclei were
recovered by centrifugation at 1,500  g for 15 min. All centrifugations
were carried out at 4jC. Nuclei were resuspended in 0.3 mL resuspension
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L PMSF, protein phosphatase inhibitors]. Nuclei were extracted with
0.4 N H2SO4 to isolate total histone proteins. The samples were precipitated
with trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in double-distilled H2O.
In vitro kinase assay. The histone H3 protein was used for an in vitro
kinase assay with active MSK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc). Reactions were
carried out at 30jC for 30 min in a mixture containing 50 Amol/L unlabeled
ATP and then stopped by adding 6 SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled
and then separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting.
Western blot analysis. Samples containing equal amounts of protein
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The
membranes were incubated in blocking buffer and hybridized with the
appropriate primary antibodies to detect phosphorylated MSK1, total

MSK1, phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10 or Ser28), total histone H3, or
h-actin. The Western blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) after hybridization with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated
secondary antibody.

Results
TPA or EGF induces MSK1 activation and cell transformation. TPA and EGF are well-known tumor promotion agents used
to study malignant transformation in cells and carcinogenesis in
animal models (15). By using the JB6 mouse epidermal cell system,
we found that TPA or EGF was very effective in dose-dependently
promoting the transformation of JB6 Cl41 cells (Fig. 1A and B).
Results also indicated that TPA or EGF caused phosphorylation of
MSK1 (Fig. 1C and D) at the same dose, as was effective for
inducing cell transformation. These results suggested that MSK1
phosphorylation might be involved in TPA-induced or EGFinduced cell transformation.
H89, a potent inhibitor of MSK1, suppresses TPA-induced
or EGF-induced AP-1 activation and cell transformation. H89
{N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonaime}
has been shown to have a potent and selective inhibitory action
against cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A;
ref. 16). H89 also was reported to strongly inhibit MSK1 activity
in vitro or in vivo (17, 18). To test whether H89 could affect cell
transformation, JB6 Cl41 cells were incubated with TPA (20 ng/mL)
or EGF (10 ng/mL) and various concentrations of H89. Our results
showed that H89 dramatically suppressed TPA-induced or EGFinduced cell transformation in JB6 Cl41 cells (Fig. 2A and B), which
supports a role for MSK1.
The AP-1 transcription factor is a dimeric complex that
comprises members of the Jun, Fos, ATF1 (activating transcription
factor 1), and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein families
(19). The regulation of cell proliferation by AP-1 is believed to be
of crucial importance for the multistage development of tumors
(20, 21). To test whether the inhibition of MSK1 by H89 might
contribute to the AP-1 activation response to TPA or EGF, we
cotransfected the AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and the pCMVb-Gal gene into JB6 Cl41 cells. Our data showed that H89 effectively
suppressed TPA-promoted (Fig. 2C, left) or EGF-promoted (Fig. 2C,
right) AP-1 activation in JB6 cells. We also found that TPA-induced
(Fig. 2D, left) or EGF-induced (Fig. 2D, right) c-fos promoter activity
in JB6 Cl41 cells was decreased by treatment with H89. These data
indicated that H89, a potent inhibitor of MSK1, is very effective in
preventing TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation and
AP-1 transactivation activity.
A dominant-negative mutant of MSK1 suppresses TPAinduced or EGF-induced cell transformation and AP-1
activation. The COOH terminal kinase domain of MSK1 is
essential for activation of its NH2 terminal domain and an
inactivation mutation either in the NH2 terminal or COOH
terminal kinase domain completely abolishes MSK1 activation
(8). To further investigate whether MSK1 is directly responsible for
TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation, we used JB6 cells
transfected with plasmids containing a pCMV5-FLAG vector
(pCMV-neo), pCMV5-FLAG-wild-type MSK1 (pCMV-MSK1 WT),
pCMV5-FLAG-MSK1-A565 COOH terminal kinase-dead (pCMVMSK1 CD), or pCMV-FLAG-MSK1-A195 NH2 terminal kinasedead (pCMV-MSK1 ND; ref. 13). These cells were treated with TPA
(20 ng/mL) or EGF (10 ng/mL) in soft agar and incubated at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 to 12 days, at which time colony

Figure 1. TPA or EGF induces cell transformation and MSK1 phosphorylation in JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal skin cells. A and B, JB6 Cl41 cells were assessed
for cell transformation in an anchorage-independent soft agar assay in the presence of TPA (A ) or EGF (B). Cells (8  103) were exposed to TPA (0, 0.5, 5, or
20 ng/mL) or EGF (0, 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/mL) in 1 mL of 0.3% BME agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 10 to 12 d,
and then colonies were counted using a microscope and the Image-Pro PLUS (v.4) computer software program. The average colony number was calculated
(right ); plates were photographed (left ) from three separate experiments (A and B ) and representative plates are shown. Significant differences were evaluated using
the Student’s t test, and the respective asterisks indicate a significant increase in TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation (*, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.0001)
compared with untreated control. C and D, JB6 Cl41 cells were used to determine the protein levels of endogenous phosphorylated MSK1 in TPA-induced or
EGF-induced cell transformation. Cells (2  105) were starved in 0.1% FBS-MEM for 24 h at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and then stimulated with 20 ng/mL
of TPA (C ) or 10 ng/mL of EGF (D ) and finally harvested at various time periods. Cells were disrupted and proteins extracted with NP40 cell lysis buffer and
Western blotting was conducted as described in the Materials and Methods using specific antibodies as indicated. h-Actin was used to confirm equal protein loading.

numbers were determined. Our results showed a marked increase
in colony numbers, as well as colony sizes in cells overexpressing
wild-type MSK1 (pCMV-MSK1 WT) promoted by TPA or EGF
compared with control cells (pCMV-neo; Fig. 3A and B). On the
other hand, the overexpression of COOH terminal dead MSK1
caused a dramatic suppression of colony formation induced by
TPA or EGF (Fig. 3A and B). Overexpression of the MSK1 NH2
terminal dead dominant-negative mutant resulted in a decrease in
the number of TPA-induced colonies (Fig. 3A), but seemed to exert
a lesser effect on EGF-induced colony numbers (Fig. 3B). These
results strongly suggested that MSK1 mediates cell transformation
stimulated by tumor promotion agents, such as TPA or EGF,
and the COOH terminal kinase domain of MSK1 plays an
important role.
To determine whether TPA- or EGF-induced cell transformation
elicited by the induction of AP-1 promoter activity mediated by
MSK1, we cotransfected the AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and
the pCMV-b-Gal gene into each of the MSK1 WT, COOH terminal
or NH2 terminal dead dominant-negative mutants, or control
JB6 Cl41 cell lines. The TPA-promoted or EGF-promoted AP-1
transcriptional activity response in JB6 Cl41 cells was much more
pronounced in MSK1 WT overexpressing cells (pCMV-MSK1 WT)
compared with mock vector control cells (Fig. 3C and D). In

contrast, a significant inhibition of AP-1 transactivation was
observed in COOH terminal and NH2 terminal kinase dead cells
after treatment with TPA (Fig. 3C) or EGF (Fig. 3D). These data
supported our idea that the induction of AP-1 promoter activity by
TPA or EGF mediated by MSK1 might be one of the mechanisms
explaining the increased anchorage-independent growth of JB6
Cl41 cells.
MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is important
in cell transformation. Different covalent modifications, such as
acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation at different sites of
the NH2 terminal tail of histone H3 seem to have various effects
on cell function. Mitotic and stimulus-inducible phosphorylation of
histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 has been characterized (22–25).
Furthermore, MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser10 and Ser28
has also been shown to occur after stimulation with EGF (25), UVB
(13, 26), TPA, or anisomycin (7). To investigate whether histone
H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 or Ser28 specifically induces cell
transformation promoted by TPA or EGF, we constructed stable
transfectant histone H3 WT and various histone H3 mutants
(S10A, S28A and S10/28A). The various cell lines were treated with
TPA (20 ng/mL) or EGF (10 ng/mL) in a soft agar matrix and
incubated at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 to 12 d. The results
indicated that the number of colonies promoted by either TPA or

atmosphere and then pretreated for 30 min with different doses of H89, followed by stimulation with 20 ng/mL of TPA (left) or 10 ng/mL of EGF (right ) for an additional
12 h and then harvested. D, JB6 Cl41 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid mixture containing the c-fos-luciferase reporter gene (0.1 Ag) and the pCMV-b-Gal
gene (0.05 Ag) for normalization purposes. At 36 h after transfection, cells were starved for 24 h by incubating in serum-deprived MEM at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere

EGF was decreased in S10A mutant cells compared with the
overexpressing histone H3 WT cells (Fig. 4A and B). The cell
transforming activity was also inhibited in H3 S28A mutant cells
compared with overexpressing H3 WT cells but to a lesser degree
than H3 S10A mutants (Fig. 4A and B). These finding indicated
that the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 is very likely a
critical site for mediating cell transformation induced by tumor
promoters, such as TPA or EGF.
MSK1 is a well known mitogen-responsive and stress-responsive
histone H3 kinase that is activated by the Ras-MAPK pathway (7).

MSK1 was incubated with human histone H3 and ATP. Immunoblot results showed that MSK1 phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10

the histone H3 kinase responsible for TPA-induced or EGF-induced

Knockdown of MSK1 suppresses cell proliferation by

siRNA-mediated knockdown of MSK1 in JB6 Cl41 could inhibit

visualized by Western blotting with specific antibodies to detect total MSK1 or phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 or Ser28. D, cells transfected with pCMV-neo,

of si-MSK1–transfected and si-MOCK–transfected JB6 Cl41 cells
revealed a suppression of endogenous MSK1 protein expression of
up to 80% compared with cells expressing the mock vector
(pU6pro; Fig. 5B).
MSK1 has been reported to play a positive role in the control of
cell proliferation of both HaCaT keratinocytes and the A431 human
epidermoid carcinoma line (11). To examine whether the
knockdown of MSK1 could affect cell proliferation, the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfonyl)2H-tetrazolium assay was used to examine proliferation of cells
stably transfected with si-MOCK or si-MSK1. Results indicated that
si-MSK1 stably transfected cells showed a marked decrease in the
rate of proliferation compared with si-MOCK stably transfected
cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, JB6 Cl41 cells overexpressing MSK1
exhibited an increased rate of proliferation (data not shown),
confirming that MSK1 is involved in cell proliferation. Using these
cell lines, we studied differences in cell cycle phases induced by
TPA or EGF. Our data indicated that knockdown of MSK1 resulted
in less cells occupying the S phase and a greater accumulation of
cells in the G1-G0 phase of the cell cycle compared with si-MOCK
control cell (Fig. 5D). These results clearly showed that the
knockdown of MSK1 suppressed cell proliferation because of an
impaired G1-S cell cycle transition.
TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation is suppressed by knockdown of MSK1. To examine the effect of
suppressing MSK1 expression on TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell

transformation, we analyzed colony-forming activity in si-MSK1
and si-MOCK cells. These cell lines were stimulated with TPA
(20 ng/mL) or EGF (10 ng/mL) in soft agar and incubated at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 to 12 days. Our results showed that,
as expected, the knockdown of MSK1 suppressed colony formation
induced by TPA (Fig. 6A, top) or EGF (Fig. 6A, bottom). Overall,
these data further showed that MSK1 plays a key role in cell
transformation induced by tumor promoting agents.
To determine whether the knockdown of MSK1 in JB6 Cl41 cells
might affect the AP-1 activation response to TPA or EGF, we
cotransfected the AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and the si-MOCK
or si-MSK1 gene into JB6 Cl41 cells. Results showed that TPAinduced or EGF-induced AP-1 activation was suppressed in siMSK1 stably expressing cells compared with mock control cells
(Fig. 6B). Similar results were obtained for EGF-induced or TPAinduced c-fos promoter activity (Fig. 6C), confirming that MSK1
has a role in c-fos promoter and AP-1 activation induced by TPA
or EGF.
We showed that the TPA-induced or EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28 was reduced in two different
MSK1 dominant-negative mutant cell lines (Fig. 4D). We therefore
next examined the effect of MSK1 knockdown on histone H3
phosphorylation (Ser10 or Ser28). Results confirmed that TPAinduced or EGF-induced histone H3 phosphorylation is effectively
suppressed in MSK1 knockdown cells compared with control
mock cells (Fig. 6D). This finding showed that MSK1 is essential for

Discussion
MSK1 is a nuclear kinase that acts downstream of both the ERK
and p38 MAPKs and has been suggested to be activated in response
to EGF, TPA, UVB, and anisomycin (7, 8, 13, 14). MSK1
phosphorylates various transcription factors, including CREB,

Cancer Research

ATF1, ATF2, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3,
and NF-nB (8–10, 27–29). MSK1 plays a critical role in the survival
of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells through the
phosphorylation of CREB (30). MSK1 also activates the transcription factor ER81, which is involved in oncogenesis and breast
tumor formation (31). MSK1 phosphorylation of these transcription factors may alter their ability to bind to their target DNA and/
or recruitment of required coactivators. MSK1 has also been shown
to be required for the full induction of several immediate early
genes, such as c-fos, junB, and mkp-1, in response to various stimuli
(5, 6). Moreover, MSK1 regulates the transcription of the Nur77,
Nurr1, and Nor1 nuclear orphan receptor genes of the NR4A
subfamily (32), the up-regulation of which has been implicated
in cell transformation (33). MSK1 is also required for chromatin
protein histone H3 and HMG-14 phosphorylation (7, 34). The
activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway and MSK1 resulting in
the elevation of phosphorylated H3 levels may contribute to the
aberrant gene expression observed in the oncogene-transformed
cells (35). However, the intriguing question is whether the
activation of MSK1 directly affects tumor promoter-induced cell
transformation.
Tumor promotion agents, such as TPA or EGF, can induce AP-1
activation and promote JB6 Cl41 cell transformation (20, 36). On
the other hand, the inhibition of AP-1 transactivation activity
suppresses TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell transformation (37).
Our results showed the relationship of MSK1 activity and AP-1
transactivation activity in TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell
transformation. Expression of c-Fos and c-Jun has been shown to
be increased TPA-induced and UVB-induced cell transformation in
JB6 cell and in mouse epidermis (38). Bcl-2–overexpressing JB6
cells enhanced TPA-induced cell transformation and also, bcl-2–
transfected cells expressed significantly more c-Fos, but not c-Jun,
after TPA treatment (39). Although overexpression of the Fos and
Jun proteins was found to correlate with a positive effect on cell
transformation (40), c-Fos might have a more important role than
c-Jun during late stage tumorigenesis (41). The importance of c-Fos
in tumor invasion has been supported in vivo, as the progression of
chemically induced papillomas to invasive squamous cell carcinomas was shown to be impaired in c-Fos–deficient mice (42).
Activated genes including c-fos and c-jun coupled with histone H3
phosphorylation at specific loci may contribute to a mechanism
that allows them to be rapidly activated in response to external
stimuli (25). The stimulation of the activity of the c-fos SRE by
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (25) might promote c-Fos
expression and c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer formation leading to
expression of AP-1 regulated genes (43). In histone H3 mutant S10A
cells, c-fos promoter activity and AP-1 activation was significantly
decreased compared with control cells (44). Therefore, histone H3
phosphorylation by MSK1 seems to be closely linked with AP-1
transactivation potential. Another implication of the increased
AP-1 transactivation activity in cell transformation induced by TPA
or EGF is that MSK1 can regulate AP-1 activation through the
phosphorylation of transcription factors, such as CREB and ATF1.

MSK-mediated phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 (6, 9) has been
implicated in the induction of c-fos and junB transcription. The
function of MSK1 is critical for interleukin-1–induced and CREBmediated c-fos gene expression in keratinocytes and promotes the
growth of both keratinocytes and human epidermoid carcinoma
cell lines (11). Therefore, increased AP-1 activity induced by MSK1
is very much associated with TPA-induced or EGF-induced cell
transformation.
In the present study, we found that MSK1 closely regulated cell
transformation and cell proliferation of JB6 Cl41 cells through the
phosphorylation of histone H3. Increased phosphorylation of
histone H3 at Ser10 was found in mitogen-stimulated and
oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblasts (45). The mutation of
Ser10 of histone H3 significantly suppressed cell transformation
promoted by EGF (44). Furthermore, we suggest that MSK1 can
directly regulate cell transformation through the phosphorylation
of histone H3 at Ser10. Histone H3 is a well-known substrate of
MSK1 when induced by mitogenic or stress stimuli (35, 45). Our
results indicated that MSK1 can directly phosphorylate histone H3
at Ser10 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of MSK1
activation in dominant-negative mutants or knockdown of MSK1
expression using siRNA suppressed the phosphorylation of histone
H3 at Ser10 and cell transformation induced by TPA or EGF. Other
studies using MSK1 and MSK2 knockout murine embryonic
fibroblasts revealed that MSK1 regulates phosphorylation of
histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28, as well as phosphorylation of
HMG-14 (7, 46). Increased mitotic histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation was also observed in various colorectal tumor cells with high
AIM-1, a mammalian Ipl1/aurora kinase involved in histone H3
phosphorylation (47). These previous studies strongly support our
finding that MSK1 might have an important role in carcinogenesis
through its phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10.
Although many factors have been shown to interact with and
promote cell transformation, we found that the MSK1 plays an
important role in cell transformation induced by tumor promoting
agents, such as TPA or EGF. MSK1 can induce cell transformation
leading to phosphorylation of histone H3 and induction of AP-1
activity, which may include its transactivating potential and DNA
binding capacity and the stability of AP-1 components. By linking
MSK1 to histone H3 phosphorylation and AP-1 transactivation
activity, these findings provide an attractive explanation of how
MSK1 might be related to cell transformation induced by tumor
promotion agents. Taken together, these results strongly suggested
that MSK1 is required for cell transformation and the relationship
of MSK1 and histone H3 might be a crucial target for cancer
chemotherapy or gene therapy in the future.
