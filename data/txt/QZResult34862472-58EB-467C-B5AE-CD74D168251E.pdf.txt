Abstract

Introduction

Aromatase is the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis. A
distal promoter, PI.4, maintains baseline levels of aromatase
in normal breast adipose tissue. In contrast, malignant
breast epithelial cells secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which
stimulates aromatase expression via proximal promoters
PI.3/PII in a cyclic AMP (cAMP)– and protein kinase C
(PKC)–dependent manner in adjacent breast adipose fibroblasts (BAF), leading to increased local concentrations of
estrogen. Although an effective treatment for breast cancer,
aromatase inhibitors indiscriminately abolish estrogen synthesis in all tissues, causing major side effects. To identify
drug targets to selectively block aromatase and estrogen
production in breast cancer, we investigated PGE2-stimulated
signaling pathways essential for aromatase induction downstream of cAMP and PKC in human BAFs. Here, we show
that PGE2 or its surrogate hormonal mixture dibutyryl cAMP
(Bt2cAMP) + phorbol diacetate (PDA) stimulated the p38,
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-1, and extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathways. Inhibition or small interfering RNA–mediated
knockdown of p38 or JNK1, but not ERK, inhibited
PGE2- or Bt2cAMP + PDA–induced aromatase activity and
expression via PI.3/PII. Conversely, overexpression of wildtype p38A or JNK1 enhanced PGE2-stimulated aromatase
expression via PII. PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulated
c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) phosphorylation and binding to the PI.3/PII region. Specific activation of protein kinase A (PKA) or EPAC with cAMP
analogues stimulated p38 and JNK1; however, only PKAactivating cAMP analogues induced aromatase expression.
The PKC activator PDA effectively stimulated p38 and JNK1
phosphorylation but not aromatase expression. Taken
together, PGE2 activation of p38 and JNK1 via PKA and
PKC is necessary for aromatase induction in BAFs, and p38
and JNK1 are potential new drug targets for tissue-specific
ablation of aromatase expression in breast cancer. [Cancer

Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of C19 steroids to estrogens
in a number of human cells and tissues, including ovarian
granulosa cells and skin and adipose fibroblasts, hypothalamic
neurons, bone, and the placental syncytiotrophoblast (1). A single
gene, CYP19, encodes aromatase. Aromatase expression in adipose
tissue is restricted to undifferentiated fibroblasts and not detected
in significant quantities in fully differentiated, lipid-filled adipocytes (1). Disproportionately high aromatase expression and
activity in undifferentiated breast adipose fibroblasts (BAF)
adjacent to malignant epithelial cells likely contributes to breast
cancer development and progression (2, 3). Moreover, malignant
epithelial cells secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin
(IL)-11, which maintain BAFs in an undifferentiated state (4). These
fibroblasts are compacted around malignant cells and provide
structural support for the tumor (4). This relationship, in which
BAFs provide functional support for cancer growth, is supported
by the observation that the breast quadrant bearing a malignant
tumor consistently displays the highest levels of aromatase
activity (2).
Expression of aromatase is controlled by several distinct and
partially tissue-specific promoters (5). The coding region of
aromatase transcripts and the translated protein, however, are
identical in all tissues where aromatase is expressed (6, 7). In
adipose tissue, three promoters are used. In disease-free breast
adipose tissue, aromatase is usually expressed at low levels via
distal promoter I.4, whereas in breast adipose tissue bearing a
tumor, aromatase expression is activated via two proximally
located promoters, I.3 and II (1). Currently, competitive or suicidal
aromatase inhibitors are the most effective endocrine treatment of
breast cancer (1, 8). However, these agents lead to indiscriminate
reduction of aromatase expression throughout the body, resulting
in severe estrogen deprivation and major side effects, including
hot flashes, bone loss, increased fracture rates, and abnormal lipid
metabolism (9). That activation of promoters I.3 and II leads to
up-regulation of aromatase expression in breast cancer provides
an opportunity to develop new breast cancer treatments that
specifically target pathways leading to PI.3/PII activation.
To this end, it is important to identify the mechanisms by which
aromatase PI.3/PII are activated in breast cancer adipose
fibroblasts. PI.3 and PII are located within 215 bp from each other
and are coordinately regulated by distinct hormonal stimuli (1).
Zhao et al. (10) found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was a potent
stimulator of aromatase expression via PI.3/PII, and several lines of
evidence suggest that PGE2 is involved in breast cancer development and progression (11, 12). Breast tumor epithelial cells secrete
large amounts of PGE2 as a result of up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2
expression (13), and high levels of PGE2 production are also

observed in other cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages,
and lymphocytes, in breast tumor (11, 12).
In human BAFs, PGE2 regulates aromatase expression through
the EP1, EP2, and EP3 prostanoid receptor subtypes (10, 14). PGE2
binding to EP1 leads to activation of protein kinase C (PKC). EP2
stimulates, whereas EP3 inhibits, the adenylate cyclase-protein
kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway (15). Both PKA- and PKCdependent signaling events are required for maximal PGE2induced aromatase expression (6, 16). PKC-dependent signaling
synergistically enhances PKA-dependent stimulation of aromatase
PI.3/PII (17). Thus, cyclic AMP (cAMP) analogues that activate
PKA strongly induce aromatase activity in BAFs, and this
induction is potentiated by phorbol esters that activate PKC
(16). Several studies have used a surrogate hormonal mixture of
dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) plus phorbol diacetate (PDA) to mimic
PGE2-stimulated intracellular signaling and aromatase expression
(6, 16, 17).
Signaling events downstream of PKA and PKC leading to
aromatase expression are unknown. The p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) has been implicated in follicle-stimulating
hormone–stimulated aromatase expression in granulosa cells (18),
and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which is an in vivo
substrate of p38 (19), was shown to bind to aromatase PI.3/PII
in response to treatment of malignant epithelial cell–conditioned
medium in BAFs (19, 20). p38, the c-jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK are
activated by environmental stress (e.g., UV and osmotic shock),
proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL-1), growth factors
(e.g., epidermal growth factor), and tumor promoters (e.g., phorbol
esters), and have important roles in regulation of gene expression,
cell proliferation, and apoptosis (21–25). Four isoforms of p38
(a, h, g, and y) have been identified (25). p38a and p38h are
sensitive to inhibitors such as SB202190 (25). There are three
major JNK isoforms: JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 (22). Relevant to our
study is JNK1, which has four splice variants: the longer JNK1a2
and JNK1h2 and the shorter JNK1a1 and JNK1h1 (22).
Stimulation of p38, JNK, and ERK requires dual phosphorylation
of threonine and tyrosine residues, which occurs as a consequence of sequential activation of pathway-specific sets of
MAP3Ks and MAP2Ks (22, 23).
In addition to PKA, EPAC1 and EPAC2 (exchange proteins
directly activated by cAMP) have been identified as novel effectors
for cAMP (26). EPACs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for
the small G protein Rap1 (26). cAMP-dependent and phorbol ester/
PKC–dependent activations of p38, JNK, and ERK have been
reported (18, 21, 27–31). For example, h-adrenergic stimulation of
p38 is blocked by a PKA inhibitor in brown adipocytes. Pituitary
adenylate cyclase–activating polypeptide stimulates p38 in neuronal cells via cAMP/EPAC (32). cAMP activates JNK in certain cell
types, and the Ras exchange motif domain of EPAC has been found
to be sufficient to stimulate JNK (31, 33). The mechanisms whereby
cAMP and PKA stimulate the p38 and JNK cascades, however,
remain poorly understood. Both PKA and EPAC can also mediate
cAMP activation of ERK (30, 34). PKA activation of ERK requires
C3G, another guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1, to bring
Rap1 to the plasma membrane and stimulate the Raf-MAPK/ERK
kinase (MEK)-ERK kinase cascade (30), whereas EPAC directly
activates the Rap1-Raf-B-MEK-ERK cascade (34). PKC-dependent
activation of p38, JNK, and ERK involves Ras (24, 25), and the
adapter protein receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK1) augments
PKC activation of JNK (35).

In this study, we examined activation of p38, JNK, and ERK by
PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA in BAFs and determined the roles of these
MAPKs in induction of aromatase expression and activity. We
report here that PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulates all three
members of the MAPK family, and that activation of p38 and JNK1
is necessary for PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulation of aromatase
expression via promoters I.3/II.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Bt2cAMP and PDA were purchased from Sigma. PKA-specific
6-MB-cAMP and EPAC-specific 8-pCPT-2¶-O-Me-cAMP were purchased
from Biolog-Life Science Institute. PGE2 was purchased from Cayman
Chemicals. Antibodies against phospho-MKK4, MKK4, phospho-p38, p38,
phospho-ATF2 (Thr71), ATF2, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-c-Jun (Ser63 or
Ser73), c-Jun, phospho-ERK, and ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. The p38 inhibitor SB202190, JNK inhibitor AS601245, and
MEK inhibitor PD98059 were purchased from EMD Biosciences. The LacZ
adenovirus was a gift from Dr. Ronald Kahn (Joslin Diabetes Center and
Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The p38a and JNK1 adenoviruses
were purchased from Seven Hills Bioreagents.
Cell culture. Human adipose tissue samples were obtained at the time
of surgery from women undergoing reduction mammoplasty following a
protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research of
Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). Isolation and culturing of primary
human BAFs were done as previously described (20). Cells were grown to
confluence and placed in serum-free medium for 16 h before treatment.
Adenoviral infection. Adenoviruses were amplified in HEK293 cells and
purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. They were applied at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 to confluent BAFs and allowed to
express for 36 h before BAFs underwent serum deprivation and treatment.
Hormonal treatments. Following serum starvation, BAFs were incubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium containing 1 Amol/L PGE2 or
0.5 mmol/L Bt2cAMP and/or 100 nmol/L PDA for various periods of time
as indicated in the figure legends. When kinase inhibitors were applied,
cells were preincubated for 1 h with the inhibitors or with DMSO (vehicle
control) of the same volume.
Cell extract preparation and immunoblotting. Cell extracts were
prepared as previously described (36). The Bradford assay was used to
quantify protein concentrations (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was done with
primary antibodies, as indicated, followed by a horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). All Western blots were developed
with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce).
TaqMan-based real-time PCR for total aromatase mRNA and
promoter-specific mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from cells with Trireagent (Sigma) and reverse transcribed with the Superscript III cDNA
synthesis system (Invitrogen). For total aromatase mRNA (coding regionspecific) real-time PCR, the forward and reverse primers were 5¶CACATCCTCAATACCAGGTCC-3¶ and 5¶-CAGAGATCCAGACTCGCATG-3¶,
and the fluorescence-labeled probe was 5¶-CCCTCATCTCCCACGGCAGATTCC-3¶. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
mRNA (control), the forward and reverse primers were 5¶-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3¶ and 5¶-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3¶, and the probe
was 5¶-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-3¶. For aromatase PII– and PI.3–
derived mRNA real-time PCR, single-stranded cDNA was first amplified by
two cycles of PCR with the PII or PI.3 primer sets, composed of their
respective forward primers 5¶-GCAACAGGAGCTATAGATGAAC-3¶ (PII) and
5¶-GTCTTGCCTAAATGTCTGATCAC-3¶ (PI.3) and the common reverse
primer 5¶-CAGAGATCCAGACTCGCATG-3¶. The single-stranded cDNA
template and double-stranded DNA product were purified by the high
pure PCR product purification kit (Roche). One aliquot of the purified DNA
sample was treated with ExoI to remove the single-stranded cDNA
template, and the amount of the remaining double-stranded DNA derived
from PII- or PI.3-specific aromatase mRNA was quantified using the same
primer and probe set for the aromatase coding region–specific real-time
PCR. Another aliquot of the purified DNA sample was directly subjected to

Figure 1. Treatment with PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulates the p38, JNK, and ERK MAPK pathways. BAFs were serum starved for 16 h and treated with
1 Amol/L PGE2 (A) or 0.5 mmol/L Bt2cAMP plus 100 nmol/L PDA (B) for the indicated times. Whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

the GAPDH real-time PCR protocol without ExoI treatment. The relative
amounts of GAPDH reflected the relative amounts of the input singlestranded cDNA templates and were used to normalize the levels of
promoter-specific aromatase mRNA. The amount of GAPDH in ExoI-treated
samples was 0.510 of that in nontreated counterparts, indicating complete
removal of single-stranded cDNA with ExoI. For aromatase PI.4–derived
mRNA real-time PCR, the forward and reverse primers were 5¶GTAGAACGTGACCAACTGGAG-3¶ and 5¶-AGGCACGATGCTGGTGATG-3¶,
and the fluorescence-labeled probe was 5¶-ATGGGCTGACCAGTGCCAGGGACC-3¶.
Aromatase activity assay. The aromatase activity of BAFs was
measured by the [3H]H2O release assay as previously described (20). Of
note, after BAFs were serum starved and treated as indicated in the figure
legends, the mixture of [3H]-labeled and cold androstenedione was added to
the medium, and incubation was continued for another 6 h.
Small interfering RNA knockdown. BAFs were transfected with a
nontargeting negative control small interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon) or
siRNAs against p38a (Dharmacon) and/or JNK1 (Invitrogen) at a final
concentration of 100 nmol/L using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
Mock transfection was conducted with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX only.
Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were serum starved for 16 h,
treated or not with 1 Amol/L PGE2 for 6 h, and processed for
immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and aromatase activity assays.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. BAFs were grown in 15-cm dishes to
confluence, serum starved for 16 h, and incubated in the presence or
absence of 1 Amol/L PGE2 or 0.5 mmol/L Bt2cAMP plus 100 nmol/L PDA as
indicated in the figure legends. The cells were harvested and subjected to
chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti–c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

Biotechnology), an anti–phospho-ATF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a control rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
as described (20). The aromatase proximal primers have been described by
Ghosh et al. (37): 5¶-AACCTGCTGATGAAGTCACAA-3¶ and 5¶-TCAGACATTTAGGCAAGACT-3¶. The amplified DNA sequence encompassed the 302/
38 bp region of aromatase PI.3/PII.

Results
PGE2 and Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulate p38, JNK, and ERK
MAPKs. In BAFs, PGE2 is a potent stimulator of aromatase
expression, and this effect is mimicked by Bt2cAMP + PDA
(6, 10, 14, 16, 17, 20). To identify the signaling events involved in
PGE2-induced aromatase expression, we examined phosphorylation of molecules within the p38, JNK, and ERK MAPK pathways.
MKK4, a MAP2K within the p38 and JNK pathways, was rapidly
phosphorylated following PGE2 stimulation, reaching a peak by
5 min and declining to basal level by 30 min. MKK4 underwent
a second phase of phosphorylation 1 to 4 h following PGE2
treatment (Fig. 1A, top). Because MKK4 is an upstream activating
kinase of p38 and JNK, phosphorylation of p38 and JNK1 was also
induced rapidly by PGE2 (refs. 22, 23; Fig. 1A, top). Remarkably,
JNK1 and its substrate c-Jun (on Ser73) exhibited a biphasic
phosphorylation similar to that of MKK4 (Fig. 1 A, top and
middle). Ser63 phosphorylation of c-Jun, by contrast, was largely
unchanged during the first 30 min following PGE2 stimulation

and declined over time (Fig. 1A, middle). ATF2 is an in vivo
substrate of both p38 and JNK (19, 20, 38). As expected, PGE2
induced acute phosphorylation of ATF2 (Fig. 1A, middle). The
ERK1/2 MAPKs were also stimulated by PGE2, exhibiting a

biphasic phosphorylation very similar to that of JNK1 (Fig. 1A,
bottom).
By simultaneously activating PKA and PKC signaling pathways,
Bt2cAMP + PDA mimics the action of PGE2, including induction of

pretreated with DMSO ( ), 5 Amol/L

(AS) for 1 h. Cells were subsequently
treated with 1 Amol/L PGE2 for 6 h
(A and B ) or 0.5 mmol/L Bt2cAMP plus
100 nmol/L PDA for 24 h (C). Aromatase
activity assays and quantification of
aromatase mRNA levels using TaqManbased real-time PCR were done. Basal
aromatase activity with DMSO pretreatment
was normalized to 1. The levels of

aromatase expression in BAFs (10, 14, 16, 17). Like PGE2, Bt2cAMP
+ PDA stimulated phosphorylation of MKK4, p38, JNK1, ATF2,
c-Jun (on both Ser63 and Ser73), and ERK1/2 (Fig. 1B); however, the
biphasic pattern of MKK4, JNK1, c-Jun, and ERK phosphorylation
was less prominent (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data indicate
that PGE2 and its surrogate hormonal mixture Bt2cAMP + PDA
stimulate the p38, JNK, and ERK MAPK pathways in BAFs.
Inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 or JNK1
reduces PGE2-stimulated aromatase activity and mRNA levels
in BAFs. We determined whether p38 and JNK1 activation by PGE2
was required for PGE2-stimulated aromatase activity and expression in BAFs. Because peak induction of total aromatase mRNA
was reached 6 to 10 h following PGE2 treatment (data not shown),
we measured aromatase activity and mRNA levels in the absence
or presence of the p38 and/or JNK inhibitors (SB202190 and
AS601245, respectively) following PGE2 treatment for 6 h (39, 40).
PGE2 induced a 4- to 5-fold increase in aromatase activity, which
was reduced to below basal levels in the presence of 5 Amol/L
SB202190 or AS601245 (Fig. 2A).
Increased aromatase activity with PGE2 treatment results from
increased aromatase gene expression (10, 16, 41). Using real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we found that PGE2 treatment
resulted in a 6- to 7-fold increase in total aromatase mRNA.
Addition of either SB202190 or AS601245 markedly reduced this
induction by f40% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Basal levels of
aromatase expression are maintained by a weak aromatase
promoter, PI.4, whereas PGE2-induced aromatase expression results
from increased activity of aromatase PII and, to a lesser extent,
PI.3 (10). Using aromatase promoter-specific real-time RT-PCRs, we
quantified aromatase transcripts derived from these promoters.
PGE2 treatment led to a robust increase in PII-derived aromatase
mRNA level, and it was significantly inhibited by SB202190 or
AS601245 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the previous report (10), PGE2
induced a very weak and statistically insignificant increase in PI.3derived aromatase mRNA level, and it was completely abolished by
the p38 or JNK inhibitor (Fig. 2A). Unlike aromatase PII–derived
mRNA, aromatase PI.4–derived mRNA was significantly downregulated by 33% following a 6-h PGE2 treatment, suggesting that
aromatase PI.4 activity is subjected to reciprocal negative
regulation. Neither the p38 nor the JNK inhibitor caused any
further changes in PI.4-derived mRNA levels (Fig. 2A).
The effects of the p38 and JNK inhibitors were additive because
dual blockade of p38 and JNK with both inhibitors completely
ablated PGE2 induction of aromatase, reducing its activity and total
mRNA to sub-basal levels (Fig. 2B).
Unlike PGE2, Bt2cAMP + PDA induced a more persistent and
sharper increase of total aromatase mRNA that started to plateau
24 h following the treatment (data not shown). Thus, we chose
Bt2cAMP + PDA treatment for 24 h, when total aromatase mRNA
level was near its peak, to examine the effects of the p38 and
JNK inhibitors on aromatase induction (Fig. 2C). Bt2cAMP + PDA
induced a 25-fold increase in aromatase activity, which was
markedly reduced by SB202190 or AS601245. In parallel, Bt2cAMP +
PDA stimulated a nearly 100-fold increase in total aromatase
mRNA. Likewise, the p38 or JNK inhibitor markedly diminished
Bt2cAMP + PDA–dependent induction of total aromatase mRNA
and aromatase PII– and PI.3–derived mRNA levels. PI.4-generated
aromatase mRNA tended to decrease following a 24-h Bt2cAMP +
PDA treatment; however, this was not statistically significant
(Fig. 2C). Unlike SB202190, treatment with AS601245 for 24 h
reduced PI.4-specific mRNA levels in the presence or absence of

PGE2- or Bt2cAMP + PDA–induced total aromatase mRNA levels
were not significantly altered (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).

Aromatase Induction in Fibroblasts Requires p38 and JNK

To validate the roles of p38 and JNK1 in PGE2 regulation of
aromatase, we used siRNAs to knock down p38a and/or JNK1
(Fig. 2D). In mock- or control siRNA–transfected BAFs, PGE2
stimulated a marked increase in aromatase activity and total
mRNA levels. BAFs transfected with sip38a had an undetectable
p38 protein level and a significant reduction in PGE2-induced
aromatase activity and total aromatase mRNA level. Likewise,
transfection of siJNK1, which abolished the expression of the
shorter JNK1 splice variants a1/h1 and which decreased the level
of the longer variants a2/h2, had a similar effect. Transfection of
both sip38a and siJNK1 further suppressed PGE2-stimulated
aromatase activity and mRNA level.
Taken together, these results indicate that activation of p38 and
JNK1, but not ERK, is necessary for PGE2- or Bt2cAMP + PDA–
dependent induction of aromatase expression via activation of
aromatase PI.3/PII. They also suggest that the JNK pathway plays a
positive role in maintaining baseline PI.4 activity.
Overexpression of wild-type p38A or JNK1 enhances PGE2
induction of aromatase mRNA levels. Conversely, we determined
whether overexpression of p38a or JNK1 would enhance aromatase
activity and promoter-specific aromatase expression. p38a is a
ubiquitously expressed and SB inhibitor–sensitive isoform of p38
(25). We infected BAFs with either a control adenovirus encoding
LacZ or an adenovirus encoding p38a or JNK1, followed by PGE2
treatment (Fig. 3). Compared with that of LacZ, adenoviral
overexpression of p38a or JNK1 markedly enhanced PGE2
induction of aromatase activity, total aromatase mRNA, and PIIderived mRNA levels. Overexpression of p38a caused a weak, but
significant, increase in basal total aromatase mRNA level (1.32 F
0.05-fold over LacZ, P < 0.05), associated with significant increases
in PI.3-derived (1.50 F 0.17-fold over LacZ, P < 0.05) and PI.4derived (1.64 F 0.29-fold over LacZ, P < 0.05) aromatase mRNA.
However, that was not sufficient to significantly increase basal
aromatase activity. Overexpression of JNK1, by contrast, caused a
significant increase in basal aromatase activity (1.85 F 0.14-fold
over LacZ, P < 0.05), associated with greater increases in basal total
aromatase mRNA levels (1.61 F 0.07-fold over LacZ, P < 0.01)
derived from PI.3 (1.63 F 0.04-fold over LacZ, P < 0.01), PII (1.91 F
0.19-fold over LacZ, P < 0.01), and PI.4 (2.81 F 0.37-fold over LacZ,
P < 0.01). Similar to our earlier observations (Fig. 2A), PGE2
treatment had little effect on PI.3-derived aromatase mRNA levels
in LacZ- and p38a-expressing cells; however, it significantly
stimulated PI.3 usage in JNK1-overexpressing cells. In addition,
PI.4-derived mRNA levels were down-regulated to a similar extent
(38% on average) in all overexpression groups following PGE2
treatment (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that
both p38a- and JNK1-dependent signaling pathways support

PGE2 activation of aromatase PII, and that the JNK1-dependent
signaling pathway also greatly enhances the activity of aromatase
PI.3 and PI.4.
PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulates binding of c-Jun and
phosphorylated ATF2 to the aromatase promoter I.3/II region.
The dependence of PGE2- or Bt2cAMP + PDA–induced aromatase
expression on JNK and p38 suggested that their substrates c-Jun
and/or ATF2 may regulate aromatase expression by interacting
with aromatase PI.3/PII. To determine c-Jun binding to aromatase
PI.3/PII, we treated BAFs with either PGE2 for 15 min or Bt2cAMP +
PDA for 30 min, treatments which stimulated peak c-Jun
phosphorylation (Fig. 1), and carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with an anti–c-Jun antibody followed by
aromatase PI.3/PII–specific PCR (Fig. 4A). In untreated cells, we
did not detect significant c-Jun binding to aromatase PI.3/PII
(Fig. 4A). Following PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA treatment, there was a
marked increase in c-Jun binding (Fig. 4A). Likewise, we carried out
chromatin immunoprecipitation with a phospho-specific ATF2
antibody, and found that treatment with PGE2 for 15 min, which
stimulated peak ATF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1), resulted in binding
of phosphorylated ATF2 to aromatase PI.3/PII (Fig. 4B). Taken
together, these data suggest that PGE2 or Bt2cAMP + PDA enhances
c-Jun and ATF2 binding to aromatase PI.3/PII, thus allowing c-Jun
and ATF2 to stimulate aromatase gene transcription.
cAMP- and PKC-dependent pathways contribute to p38 and
JNK activation. To determine the cAMP effector(s) responsible
for p38 and JNK activation and induction of aromatase in BAFs,
we used a PKA-specific cAMP analogue (6-MB-cAMP) or an EPACspecific cAMP analogue (8-pCPT-2¶-O-Me-cAMP), along with
Bt2cAMP that activates both PKA and EPAC (42, 43). All three
cAMP analogues induced p38, JNK1, and ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, only the PKA-activating cAMP analogues,
6-MB-cAMP and Bt2cAMP, strikingly induced aromatase mRNA
levels, whereas the EPAC-specific analogue 8-pCPT-2¶-O-Me-cAMP
did not (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that both PKA and EPAC
mediate cAMP-stimulated p38 and JNK activation, whereas
activation of PKA, but not EPAC, is responsible for aromatase
induction. Moreover, activation of p38 and JNK seems to be
required, but not sufficient, for aromatase induction.
We further examined the relative roles of cAMP and PDA/PKC in
stimulation of p38 and JNK1, and induction of aromatase mRNA
levels. Compared with Bt2cAMP, PDA induced comparable p38
phosphorylation and greater JNK1 phosphorylation with a similar
time course (Fig. 5C). However, PDA was a weaker stimulator of
aromatase expression than Bt2cAMP (Fig. 5D), although it
synergistically enhanced Bt2cAMP-stimulated aromatase gene
transcription by f9-fold (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that PKC

contributes to PGE2- or Bt2cAMP + PDA–stimulated p38 and JNK1
phosphorylation. They also indicate that activation of p38 and
JNK1 by PDA without concurrent PKA activation is not sufficient
for maximal aromatase induction.

Discussion
Our findings indicated that PGE2 stimulated p38, JNK1, and
ERK via cAMP and PKC. Among these, p38 and JNK1 were
essential, but not sufficient, for PGE2-dependent induction of
aromatase expression mainly via PII. Interestingly, PGE2-stimulated phosphorylation of MKK4, JNK1, c-Jun, and ERK exhibited
a distinct biphasic pattern. This may reflect a cross talk among
the EP receptors, kinases, and phosphatases involved in

regulating the MAPK pathways. Indeed, when cells were treated
with Bt2cAMP + PDA, which bypasses EP receptor activation,
biphasic phosphorylation was much less prominent. Richards
et al. (14) showed that EP3 also mediates PGE2 action in BAFs by
inhibiting the adenylate cyclase-PKA pathway and antagonizing
signaling through EP2. The dynamic net effect of EP receptor
stimulation on the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway would
determine activation or inactivation of downstream MAPK
cascades.
Both PKA and EPACs mediate cAMP signaling (26). Although our
findings suggest that PKA, but not EPAC, mediated the stimulatory
effects of PGE2 or cAMP on aromatase expression, we showed that
EPACs as well as PKA were capable of stimulating p38, JNK1, and
ERK phosphorylation, consistent with other published reports

Aromatase Induction in Fibroblasts Requires p38 and JNK

indicating the roles of both PKA and EPACs in MAPK activation
(28, 30–34, 44).
Our results were also consistent with published data about phorbol
ester/PKC–dependent activation of p38 and JNK, which seems to
involve PKC activation of the Ras-MEK kinase 1-MKK4 pathway
(24, 25), and RACK1-facilitated PKC phosphorylation of JNK (35).
The p38 and JNK inhibitors had different efficacies particularly
on PI.3 activities induced by PGE2-and Bt2cAMP + PDA, respectively. Bt2cAMP + PDA was a more potent stimulator of
aromatase than PGE2 because it induces stronger aromatase
activity, higher levels of total aromatase mRNA, and especially
more robust PI.3 activity as well as that of PII. PGE2, by contrast,
led to a weak and statistically insignificant increase in PI.3
activity. Aromatase PI.3 contains an upstream activator protein-1
(AP-1) site and two cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sites (45).
Similarly, aromatase PII contains a CRE site in the 211/ 199
region (20). ATF2 can form homodimers or heterodimers with
members of the ATF and AP-1 families, including c-Jun, and may
regulate aromatase PI.3/PII via these CRE and/or AP-1 sites (46).
Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showing binding of
c-Jun and ATF2 to aromatase PI.3/PII support this idea. Thus,
differential activation of ATF2 and c-Jun, which is indicative of
activation of upstream p38 and JNK1, may account for differential
activation of PI.3/PII. Indeed, Bt2cAMP + PDA–induced peak
ATF2 phosphorylation was more persistent ( for up to 30 min),
and c-Jun phosphorylation more robust (on both Ser63 and Ser73),
whereas PGE2-stimulated ATF2 phosphorylation was shorter
( for up to 15 min), and c-Jun phosphorylation weaker (only on
Ser73). Because relatively weak PGE2 stimulation of both p38 and
JNK1 barely stimulated PI.3, inhibiting one of the kinases readily
returned PI.3 activity to the basal level (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
because Bt2cAMP + PDA stimulation of p38 and JNK1 was
relatively strong, even complete inhibition of one kinase may still
allow enough activity of the other to keep PI.3 usage a bit above
the basal level as seen in Fig. 2C.
Using inhibitors, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression, we
established the roles of p38a and JNK1 in PGE2 regulation of
aromatase expression. Furthermore, our data suggest that JNK1 is
relatively more important than p38 for this regulation because,
in blocking PGE2 induction of aromatase mRNA levels, JNK
inhibitor was more effective than the p38 inhibitor, and partial
JNK1 knockdown was as effective as complete p38 knockdown;
also, JNK1 overexpression had stronger and broader stimulatory
effects on aromatase promoter activities. This is consistent with
our hypothesis that p38 regulates aromatase expression through
ATF2, and JNK regulates aromatase expression through both ATF2
and c-Jun. We previously showed binding of phosphorylated ATF2
to aromatase PI.3/PII in BAFs following treatment with MCF-7 cellconditioned medium (20). Here, we showed that PGE2 stimulated
binding of c-Jun and ATF2 to aromatase PI.3/PII and that the
binding coincided with peak phosphorylation and, therefore, peak
transactivational activity of the proteins. Ghosh et al. (37) have
identified the CRE element of aromatase PII as the c-Jun binding
site in granulosa cells; however, c-Jun represses rather than
promotes aromatase expression in those cells. Our preliminary
results suggested that ATF2 and c-Jun bound to the same element
in BAFs (data not shown). Because ATF2 and c-Jun are broad
regulators of gene expression, we cannot rule out the possibility
that p38 or JNK stimulates aromatase expression indirectly.
Given the presence of an upstream AP-1 site in PI.4 that ATF2
and c-Jun may jointly regulate (47), it is not surprising that

binds to the EP1 and EP2 receptors and stimulates the PKC and adenylate
cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathways, respectively. Both PKA and PKC contribute to
activation of MKK4, JNK1, and p38, resulting in phosphorylation and activation
of transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2. Active c-Jun and ATF2 bind to the
aromatase PI.3/PII region and promote aromatase gene transcription. Activation
of the p38 and JNK pathways is necessary, but not sufficient, for maximal PGE2
induction of aromatase, which requires collaboration among various signaling
pathways downstream of PKA and PKC, and concerted up-regulation and/or
activation of a number of transcription factors and coactivators such as c-Jun,
ATF2, LRH-1, and PGC1a.

overexpression of p38a or JNK1 increased baseline PI.4-specific
aromatase mRNA level, and that the JNK inhibitor AS601245
markedly reduced it during a 24-h period. Indeed, Zhao et al. (47)
have observed that c-Jun and the p38-dependent pathway were
important for PI.4 activation.
Other transcriptional enhancers that regulate aromatase gene
expression in BAFs have been identified, including PGC1a and
LRH-1 (48–50). LRH-1 binds to a nuclear receptor half site within
aromatase PI.3/PII and promotes aromatase expression (49). By
associating with LRH-1, PGC1a is a coactivator and enhances the
transcriptional activity of LRH-1 (50). In BAFs, PKA stimulates
PGC1a expression, and both PKA and PKC stimulate the
expression of LRH-1 (48, 50).
We found that EPAC or PDA activation of p38 and JNK1 without
PKA stimulation was not sufficient for appreciable induction of
aromatase expression in BAFs. We hypothesize that maximal PGE2
or Bt2cAMP + PDA induction of aromatase expression entails
collaboration among various signaling pathways downstream of
PKA and PKC, resulting in concerted up-regulation and/or
activation of a number of transcription factors, including c-Jun,
ATF2, LRH-1, and PGC1a (Fig. 6). Further studies are needed to
elucidate the signaling pathways and downstream transcription
factors that transactivate the aromatase promoter region, and to
identify additional potential molecular targets for breast cancer–
selective inhibition of aromatase expression.
