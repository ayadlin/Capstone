BACKGROUND: In this phase 2 study, the authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the Aurora B kinase inhibitor barasertib compared with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LDAC) in patients aged 60 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS:
Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either open-label barasertib 1200 mg (as a 7-day intravenous infusion) or LDAC 20 mg (subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days) in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective complete response rate (OCRR) (complete responses [CR] plus confirmed CRs with incomplete recovery of neutrophils or platelets [CRi] according to Cheson criteria
[also requiring reconfirmation of CRi 21 days after the first appearance and associated with partial recovery of platelets and neutrophils]). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. RESULTS: In total, 74 patients (barasertib, n 5 48; LDAC,
n 5 26) completed 1 cycle of treatment. A significant improvement in the OCRR was observed with barasertib (35.4% vs 11.5%; difference, 23.9%; 95% confidence interval, 2.7%-39.9%; P <.05). Although the study was not formally sized to compare OS data, the median OS with barasertib was 8.2 months versus 4.5 months with LDAC (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.58;
P 5.663). Stomatitis and febrile neutropenia were the most common adverse events with barasertib versus LDAC (71% vs 15% and
67% vs 19%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Barasertib produced a significant improvement in the OCRR versus LDAC and had a more

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents more frequently with advancing age.1,2 With standard intensive induction chemotherapy, 5-year survival rates in patients aged <60 years approach 50%; however, in older patients, prognosis remains
poor.3,4 In a recent study of 446 patients aged >70 years who received intensive cytarabine chemotherapy between 1990
and 2008, the median survival did not exceed 6 months, and mortality rates 30% were noted at 8 weeks.5 Patient-related
and drug-related factors, including age, contraindications/reduced tolerability to chemotherapy, and a poor cytogenetic
risk profile, account for poor survival outcomes in elderly patients with AML.3,5 To date, low-dose cytosine arabinoside
(LDAC) is the only agent that has demonstrated clinical benefit in randomized studies of patients aged 60 years with
AML who are not considered fit to receive intensive induction chemotherapy,6 and improvement in survival rates among
elderly patients remains an elusive treatment goal.7
Aurora kinases are a family of proteins (Aurora A, Aurora B, and Aurora C) that are known to play an integral role in
the regulation of mitosis and chromosomal segregation.8,9 Observed over-expression in a variety of cancers, including
AML, together with evidence of a potential for oncogenic transformation with increased activity,10-15 implicate Aurora B
kinase as a rational target for small-molecule anticancer therapy. Barasertib is a prodrug that rapidly undergoes phosphatase-mediated cleavage in serum to release barasertib-hQPA, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase.

Original Article

Preclinical evidence of efficacy with barasertib (growth inhibition and survival in AML models)16-19 also extends to
the clinical setting, in which preliminary anti-AML activity has been demonstrated in early phase clinical studies.20-23
The current study was designed with 2 stages. Here,
we report findings from stage I, in which we compare the
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of barasertib and LDAC
in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. The results
would then inform the decision to proceed to stage II, to
determine the relative efficacy of barasertib alone and in
combination with LDAC compared with LDAC alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Eligible patients were aged 60 years with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia and blast crisis of chronic myeloid
leukemia) who were considered unsuitable for intensive
induction with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and
who had a World Health Organization performance status from 0 to 3 (a performance status of 3 was acceptable
if it was solely attributable to the underlying leukemia).
Patients also had to be considered likely to complete 3
cycles of treatment. Unsuitability for intensive chemotherapy was determined by the treating physician in discussion with the patient and also required at least 1 of the
following: age 75 years, adverse cytogenetics, a World
Health Organization performance status >2, and organ
dysfunction arising from significant comorbidities not
directly related to leukemia. Exclusion criteria included
serum bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal
(ULN); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2.5 times the ULN; serum creatinine >1.5 times the ULN or 24-hour creatinine clearance
50 mL per minute (according to Cockcroft-Gault criteria); central nervous system disease because of leukemic
infiltration; selected, uncontrolled, intercurrent illness;
QTc 470 msec; administration of anticancer agents
within the 2 weeks before the start of study treatment; and
clinically significant toxicity (National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI
CTCAE] grade >1) related to treatment with anticancer
agents. All patients provided written informed consent.
Administration of hydroxyurea before and up to 3 days
into cycle 1 was allowed at the discretion of the investigator. This was limited to patients who had a white blood
count 25 3 109/L, and the total duration of hydroxyurea could not exceed 7 days.

Study Design

This was an open-label, randomized, 2-stage, phase 2
study of barasertib versus LDAC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00952588) conducted at 46 centers across Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States. Patients were
randomized 2:1 to receive either open-label barasertib
(1200 mg as a 7-day continuous intravenous infusion
from day 1 to day 8) or LDAC (20 mg as a subcutaneous
injection twice daily for 10 days) in 28-day cycles. Unless
considered inappropriate by the investigator, patients
were expected to complete at least 3 cycles (12 weeks) of
treatment. Additional cycles could be administered at the
discretion of the investigator if the patient was considered
to be deriving clinical benefit. The trial was approved by
the relevant institutional ethical committees or review
bodies and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice, and the AstraZeneca
policy on bioethics.24
The primary endpoint for stage I of this study was the
objective complete response rate (OCRR), defined as the
proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR)
and a confirmed CR with incomplete recovery of neutrophils or platelets (confirmed CRi; measured according to
criteria established by the International Working Group
for AML trials,25 but also requiring partial recovery of neutrophils and platelets in the absence of transfusions and
with confirmation of the CRi 21 days after the first
appearance). Secondary endpoints included the duration of
response, the time to response, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) in responders, and safety.
Assessments

Blood samples and bone marrow aspirates were collected
at baseline and at the end of each cycle; if an aspirate could
not be obtained, then an optional trephine biopsy was
requested. Bone marrow aspirates/biopsies and peripheral
blood samples were assessed by blinded independent central review. Patients who achieved a CR or a confirmed
CRi were followed every 4 weeks to assess the duration of
response.
Safety assessments were conducted throughout the
study and comprised the incidence of adverse events
(AEs), graded according to NCI CTCAE version 3.0, and
changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and
electrocardiograms.
Statistical Analysis

The sample size for stage I was based on the assumption
that, with 75 patients, there was 80% probability of
Cancer

observing at least a 10% difference in the OCRR, assuming that the true LDAC and barasertib OCRR rates were
18%6 and 36%, respectively. Efficacy analyses in stage I
were performed on the modified intention-to-treat set,
which included all randomized patients who commenced
study treatment. Treatment differences (and 95% confidence intervals) for the primary endpoint of OCRR were
calculated according to the Newcombe-Wilson method.26
Estimates of OS were obtained using log-rank testing and
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additional response and OS analyses were conducted in patients grouped according to previously established profiles of cytogenetic risk.27 Safety
data were summarized descriptively.
RESULTS
Patients

Between August 2009 and July 2010, 77 patients (median
age, 76 years; range, 61-85 years) were randomized to
receive either barasertib (n 5 51) or LDAC (n 5 26).
Three patients who were randomized to the barasertib
arm did not receive study treatment because they died
(n 5 1) or because they no longer met the eligibility criteria (n 5 2). At the time of data cutoff (June 27, 2011), 69
patients had actively discontinued treatment. The reasons
for active discontinuation included disease progression/no
improvement (barasertib, n 5 19 [37%]; LDAC, n 5 18
[69%]), improvement of their condition (barasertib,
n 5 10 [20%]; LDAC, n 5 1 [4%]), voluntary discontinuation (barasertib, n 5 5 [10%]; LDAC, n 5 4 [15%]),
and AEs (barasertib, n 5 4 [8%]; LDAC, n 5 2 [8%]).
The remaining 5 patients died without actively discontinuing treatment. At the time of data cutoff, no patients
remained on treatment.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
were generally comparable between the treatment groups
(Table 1). However, differences between the barasertib
and LDAC arms were observed for the proportion of
patients within the age category 75 years (65% vs 27%,
respectively), those with “unknown” cytogenetics (by central analysis; 29% vs 15%, respectively), and those with a
World Health Organization performance status of 3 (6%
vs 15%, respectively).
Efficacy

Treatment with barasertib was associated with a significant improvement in OCRR compared with LDAC treatment (35% [n 5 17 of 48 patients] vs 12% [n 5 3 of 26
patients]), which equated to a difference of 24% in favor
of barasertib (95% confidence interval, 2.7-39.9; P < .05)
(Table 2). Response to barasertib treatment was reported
Cancer

July 15, 2013

across all cytogenetic risk groups, including an OCRR of
33% for the 9 patients who had adverse cytogenetics
(Table 2). By comparison, response to LDAC was confined to patients who had either favorable or intermediate
cytogenetic risk. Differences identified in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between treatment
arms had a negligible impact on efficacy (data not shown).
Response to barasertib treatment was sustained for a
median duration of 82 days (range, 28-321 days). The
median duration of response to LDAC (3 responses)
could not be determined but ranged between 30 days and
85 days. Most responses were achieved within 2 treatment
cycles (barasertib, 12 of 17 responses; LDAC, 2 of 3
responses), corresponding to a median time to response of
59 days (range, 27-180 days) and 64 days (range, 63-96
days), respectively. Two patients who were randomized to
receive barasertib, both with adverse cytogenetics, were
ongoing in response at the time of data cutoff (Fig. 1).
The median follow-up for patients who were alive at
the time of data cutoff was 12.9 months in the barasertib
group and 13.6 months in the LDAC group. Across both
treatment arms, the minimum follow-up for patients who
remained alive at the time of data cutoff was 11.2 months.
There were 34 deaths (71%) in the barasertib group compared with 18 deaths (69%) in the LDAC group.
Although stage I of the study was not formally sized to
compare OS data, the median survival was 8.2 months for
the barasertib group and 4.5 months for the LDAC
group. This difference was not statistically significant
(hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.58;
P 5 .663) (Fig. 2A). The OS treatment effect was broadly
similar within each of the cytogenetic risk groups,
although the small numbers of patients in each subgroup
precluded any definitive conclusions (Fig. 2B).
Additional exploration of the OS results revealed
that the proportion of patients who received subsequent
anticancer therapy after progression was comparable
between treatment groups (barasertib, n 5 11 [23%];
LDAC, n 5 7 [27%]). However, these therapies were classified as intensive in a greater proportion of LDACtreated patients (barasertib, n 5 4 [8%]; LDAC, n 5 7
[27%]). Moreover, the 3 patients who had the longest survival duration in the LDAC group had subsequently
begun intensive anticancer therapy within 3 months of
randomization. In both groups, pyrimidine analogs were
the most commonly administered subsequent anticancer
therapies.
The median DFS among barasertib-treated patients
who achieved a CR or a CRi was 5.6 months (range, 2.012.5 months). The median DFS with LDAC (based on 3

Safety

All patients who commenced therapy within this study
received at least 1 cycle of treatment (Fig. 3). Of the completed cycles, most patients received 80% of the planned
dose (barasertib, n 5 45 [94% of the planned dose];
LDAC, n 5 24 [92% of the planned dose]).
The AEs (any grade; any cause) that occurred most
commonly and with higher incidence in the barasertib
group versus the LDAC group were stomatitis (71% vs
15%), febrile neutropenia (67% vs 19%), and diarrhea
(50% vs 12%) (Table 3). The overall incidence of grade
3 AEs was higher in the barasertib group (n 5 40; 83%)
2614

compared with the LDAC group (n 5 18; 69%), with
grade 3 febrile neutropenia (50% vs 19%), stomatitis/
mucositis (29% vs 0%), and pneumonia (23% vs 8%)
reported more frequently (15% higher incidence) in the
barasertib group than in the LDAC group (Table 3).
Grade 3 infection events (grouped) also occurred at a
higher incidence (>15%) in the barasertib group compared with the LDAC group (40% vs 23%, respectively),
with pneumonia and lobar pneumonia the most commonly reported infection event in either treatment group
(barasertib, 25%; LDAC, 8%).
Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 23 (48%) barasertib-treated patients and in 10 (39%) LDAC-treated
patients. In the barasertib group, SAEs observed in >1
patient were pneumonia (including lobar pneumonia;

group), stomatitis (n 5 1) and stomatitis plus febrile neutropenia (n 5 1) resolved with a reduction in dose. Interruption of dosing because of AEs was noted for 1 patient
in the barasertib arm (grade 2 extravasation) and for 2
patients in the LDAC arm (n 5 1, chills and hypoxia
events; n 5 1, pharyngitis); effective resolution of the
event was reported for the barasertib-treated patient only.

these events were judged treatment related, with the exception of sepsis, which was deemed to be related to LDAC
treatment. Furthermore, mortality rates for each treatment
group were evaluated at 30-day intervals (Table 4). At 30
days from the start of treatment, mortality rates were similar between treatment groups; whereas, at 60 days and 90
days, the rates were numerically lower in the barasertib
group. There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters pertaining to liver or renal function or in vital signs after treatment with either barasertib
or LDAC.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate barasertib versus a standard of care in AML. The first stage of
this open-label, randomized study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant and apparently durable
improvement in OCRR with barasertib compared with
LDAC in patients aged >60 years with newly diagnosed
AML who were considered unfit for intensive chemotherCancer

apy. The magnitude of response observed in this study
was up to 2-fold higher than that observed with preliminary signals in previously reported barasertib monotherapy studies,22,23 but it was similar to that reported in a
previous phase 1 dose-escalation study of barasertib in
combination with LDAC.21 Furthermore, barasertib
treatment demonstrated responses across all cytogenetic
risk groups; a potential benefit was indicated for those
patients with adverse cytogenetic profiles, although the
patient numbers were too small to make any definitive
conclusions.
Survival analysis revealed a numerical trend in favor
of barasertib in this population of elderly patients with
AML. The failure to observe a more distinct result
between treatment groups may reflect the lack of power in
this study to detect a robust treatment effect on survival.
However, previous studies with LDAC suggest that more
death events may have been expected 11 months postrandomization than were observed in this study.6,28 On further analysis, an imbalance in subsequent intensive

therapy received postdiscontinuation of randomized treatment (8% in the barasertib group compared with 27% in
the LDAC group) also may have influenced these OS
findings, although the small sample numbers preclude
any robust conclusions.
Safety results were consistent with the known tolerability profile of barasertib in monotherapy studies.20,22,23
Febrile neutropenia and stomatitis/mucositis, as expected,
occurred at a higher incidence in patients who received barasertib compared with those who received LDAC. Overall,
observed AEs generally resolved and led to a dose modification in only a small proportion of patients. Despite the
increased tolerability burden from barasertib treatment, cumulative toxicities were not observed with barasertib treatment, and rates of drug discontinuation and mortality were
similar for the barasertib group and the LDAC group.
Although it was expected that patients enrolled in this study
were to receive a minimum of 3 treatment cycles, in reality,
only approximately 50% of patients received >1 cycle. The
reasons for discontinuation after only 1 or 2 cycles were
investigated and were considered justified, eg rising blast
counts or no response. Early mortality rates with barasertib
treatment observed here were superior to findings from a
previous study of older patients with AML who received intensive chemotherapy, which reported 8-week mortality
rates in excess of 30%.5
Recent studies of other agents with activity versus
Aurora kinases have also demonstrated preliminary evidence of anticancer activity. These include AMG900,29 a
pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor currently being investigated
in a phase 1 trial in adult patients with acute leukemias
(NCT01380756). However, because AMG900 is not
selective for Aurora B, it remains to be established whether
the antileukemia activity observed with this agent is
because of an effect on Aurora B and/or other target(s).
The Aurora A kinase inhibitor MLN8237 has demonstrated preclinical anti-AML activity30 and is currently in
a phase 2 trial in patients with AML or myelodysplastic
syndrome (NCT00830518).
The significant favorable response to barasertib treatment versus LDAC observed in this study confirms and
extends preliminary signals of efficacy observed in older
patients with AML. On the basis of these results, AstraZeneca is considering further development options for this
active compound in this area of high unmet medical need.
