Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

FOXM1 is implicated in genotoxic drug resistance but its role and mechanism of action remain
unclear. Here, we establish that γH2AX foci, indicative of DNA double strand breaks, accumulate
in a time-dependent manner in the drug sensitive MCF-7 cells but not in the resistant counterparts
in response to epirubicin. We find that FOXM1 expression is associated with epirubicin sensitivity
and double strand break (DSB) repair. Ectopic expression of FOXM1 can increase cell viability
and abrogate DSBs sustained by MCF-7 cells following epirubicin, owing to an enhancement in
repair efficiency. Conversely, alkaline comet and γH2AX foci formation assays show that Foxm1null cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage, epirubicin and γ-irradiation. Furthermore, we find
that FOXM1 is required for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) but not nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), using HeLa cell lines habouring an integrated direct repeat green
fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) reporter for DSB repair. We also identify BRIP1 as a direct
transcription target of FOXM1 by promoter analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay. In
agreement, depletion of FOXM1 expression by siRNA down-regulates BRIP1 expression at the
protein and mRNA levels in MCF-7 and the epirubicin resistant MCF-7 EpiR cells. Remarkably,
the requirement for FOXM1 for DSB repair can be circumvented by reintroduction of BRIP1,
suggesting that BRIP1 is an important target of FOXM1 in DSB repair. Indeed, like FOXM1,
BRIP1 is needed for HR. These data suggest that FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 expression to modulate
epirubicin-induced DNA damage repair and drug resistance.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide, with 1 in 9 of all
western hemisphere women developing this disease in their lifetimes (1). Anthracyclines,
including epirubicin and doxorubicin, are some of the most widely used chemotherapeutic
drugs for the treatment of breast cancers in the adjuvant setting (2, 3). It is also the preferred
option for the management of advanced or metastatic breast cancers (2). Anthracyclines
function by intercalating DNA strands, releasing free oxygen radicals, and inhibiting
topoisomerase II activity (4). Acting as topoisomerase II poisons, anthracyclines form
complexes with DNA and topoisomerase, preventing DNA resealing, and thus promoting
double strand breaks. The resulting unrepaired breaks lead to damages to the genome and a
wide range of cytotoxic effects and ultimately cell death (5, 6). Despite anthracyclines being
some of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs, patients will eventually develop
resistance and relapse (3, 7). The exact molecular mechanism underlying response and
resistance to epirubicin is still not fully understood.
FOXM1 is a member of the Forkhead box (FOX) superfamily of transcription factors that
share a conserved winged-helix DNA-binding domain (8). It is ubiquitously expressed in
actively proliferating tissues (9, 10) and plays a crucial role in a wide range of biological
processes, including cell cycle progression (11, 12), angiogenesis (13-15), metastasis (14,
16, 17), apoptosis (18), tissue regeneration (19) and drug resistance (15, 20). FOXM1 has
been reported to be a cellular modulator of drug sensitivity and resistance in various types of
cancers. In breast cancer, FOXM1 has been shown to be involved in endocrine (20, 21),
cisplatin (15), trastuzumab and paclitaxel (22), gefitinib (23) and, most recently in epirubicin
resistance (24). In response to DNA damage, Chk2 has been proposed to phosphorylate and
stabilise FOXM1, which in turn induces the expression of breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2)
and X-ray cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1), genes involved in DNA damage repair
(25). However, recent evidence challenges the direct regulation of BRCA2 and XRCC1 by
FOXM1 upon DNA damage (15). In essence, despite having a role in DNA damage repair,
the mechanism of action of FOXM1 in DNA damage repair is still poorly understood.

In this study we found a link between FOXM1 and the BRCA1-interacting protein (BRIP1).
BRIP1, also known as BACH1 or FANCJ, is a DNA helicase that interacts with the BRCA1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, an important motif involved in cellular responses to DNA
damage (26, 27). This BRCA1-BRIP1 interaction contributes to the DNA repair activity of
BRCA1 and, on the basis of this interaction, BRIP1 has been proposed to be a potential
breast cancer susceptibility gene (26, 27). Consistently, BRIP1 mutations are associated with
intermediate risk of breast cancer predisposition (26, 28). BRIP1 (BRCA1 interacting
protein C-terminal helicase 1) has a complex role in double stranded-break (DSB) repair.
Homologous recombination (HR) is compromised in human cells after depletion of BRIP1
(29). In fact, for the high fidelity homologous recombination (HR), BRIP1 requires the
integrity of the helicase domain and BRCA1 binding (30, 31), but when uncoupled from
BRCA1, the error-prone microhomology-mediated non-homologous end-joining (MMEJ) or
polη-dependent translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) take precedence (30, 31). Moreover, the
BRCA1-BRIP1 complex formation is also essential for DNA damage-induced G2/M
checkpoint control (32). In the present study, we investigated the role of FOXM1 in BRIP1
expression, DNA damage repair and epirubicin resistance in breast cancer cells and mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs).

Results
Increased DNA damage upon depletion of FOXM1 levels

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The involvement of FOXM1 in genotoxic drug resistance has led us to investigate if
FOXM1 confers epirubicin resistance through enhancing DNA damage repair (24). To
investigate this, we examined the formation of γH2AX-foci in MCF-7 and the previously
described MCF-7 derived epirubicin resistant (MCF-7 EpiR) breast cancer cell lines
following epirubicin treatment (Figure 1A) (20). We found that MCF-7 cells had
significantly higher number of γH2AX foci after epirubicin treatment compared with
MCF-7-EpiR cells (Figure 1A), suggesting that the parental MCF-7 cells sustained higher
levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) compared with the resistant cells in response to
epirubicin. To test the role of FOXM1 in DNA damage, we depleted FOXM1 with siRNA in
the resistant cells and found that FOXM1 knockdown significantly increased the number of
γH2AX foci in comparison with those transfected with the non-specific (NS) siRNA (Figure
1B). The accumulation of γH2AX foci was observed 4 and 24 h after epirubicin treatment,
suggesting that FOXM1 depletion renders resistant cells more susceptible to DSBs induced
by epirubicin. Similarly, FOXM1 knockdown also sensitised MCF-7 EpiR cells to
epirubicin, further supporting a role of FOXM1 in epirubicin resistance (Supplementary
Figure S5B and S5C).
FOXM1 enhances DNA damage repair and confers epirubicin resistance

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To examine the role of FOXM1 in epirubicin-resistance and DNA damage repair, we
compared the proliferative rates of MCF-7, MCF-7 EpiR and MCF-7 cells stably expressing
FOXM1 (MCF-7 FOXM1) in response to epirubicin (Figure 2A). SRB assay revealed that
the overexpression of FOXM1 was sufficient to increase epirubicin resistance to the parental
MCF-7 cells (Figure 2B). These data suggest that overexpression of FOXM1 reduces
sensitivity to epirubicin and protects breast cancer cells against epirubicin-induced DNA
damage. We next used alkaline comet assays to analyse the levels of damaged DNA in
MCF-7, MCF-7 FOXM1 and MCF-7 EpiR cells in response to 1 μM epirubicin. As
expected, overexpression of FOXM1 led to significantly lower tail moments when compared
to MCF-7 WT, mimicking the lower rates of DNA damage sustained in MCF-7 EpiR cells
(Figure 2C). To directly assess the influence of FOXM1 on DNA damage, we assayed the
accumulation of DNA damage associated γH2AX foci on wild-type (WT) and Foxm1−/−
MEFs (Figure 3) treated with 0.1 μM epirubicin, a dose which produced significant
differential cytotoxic effects on WT and Foxm1−/− MEFs (Supplementary Figure S1).
Consistently, when assessing DNA damage by γH2AX foci quantification a greater number
of γH2AX foci was also observed at the longer times of 4 and 24 h after epirubicin treatment
in the Foxm1−/− compared to WT MEFs (Figure 3). However, it is also notable that the
accumulation of γH2AX foci in both WT and Foxm1−/− MEFs was at comparable rates at
the earlier time points of 0.5 and 2 h, indicating that the lower levels of γH2AX foci
observed in the WT is not due to the inability of epirubicin to access the genome DNA or to
cause DNA damage in the FOXM1 expressing cells. The accumulation of γH2AX foci in the
Foxm1−/− MEFs also suggests that the cells are less effective in repairing DSBs. To
demonstrate further that the accumulation of γH2AX foci in the FOXM1-deficient cells is
due to impaired DNA damage repair, WT and Foxm1−/− MEFs were γ-irradiated (5Gy) and
assayed for γH2AX foci formation at 0 (mock irradiated), 4 and 24 h following irradiation
(Figure 4A and 4B). The results showed that the accumulation of γH2AX foci in both WT
and Foxm1−/− MEFs was at comparable rates at the earlier time points of 0 and 4 h,
indicating similar levels of DNA damage induced. However, a greater number of γH2AX
foci was also observed at the longer time point of 24 h following γ-irradiation in the
Foxm1−/− when compared to WT MEFs, suggesting that MEFs-deficient of FOXM1 are
less effective in DNA damage repair rather than more susceptible to DNA damage. To

directly assess the influence of FOXM1 on DNA damage, we performed alkaline comet
assay on wild-type (WT) and Foxm1−/− MEFs (Figure 4C) treated with 0.1 μM epirubicin.
The result showed epirubicin induced higher levels of DNA damage in Foxm1−/− MEFs
compared to the WT control after 4 and 24 h treatment as revealed by the longer comet tails
(Figure 4C). Measurement of the tail moment, olive moment and percentage of DNA in tail
(Figure 4D) showed that the epirubicin-induced DNA damage was significantly higher for
Foxm1−/− MEFs compared to WT MEFs after epirubicin treatment.
FOXM1 reconstitution in Foxm1−/− MEFs abrogates the accumulation of γH2AX foci
To demonstrate definitely that the lack of FOXM1 in Foxm1−/− MEFs is responsible for the
progressive accumulation of γH2AX foci upon epirubicin treatment, we next sought to
determine whether reintroduction of FOXM1 to Foxm1−/− MEFs was able to abolish the
accumulation of γH2AX foci. As seen in Figure 5A, cells that were transfected with
pmCherry-FOXM1 (red) displayed significantly fewer foci compared with the neighbouring
non-transfected cells. However, Foxm1−/− MEFs transfected with the empty-pmCherry
control have similar kinetics for γH2AX foci accumulation as the non-transfected cells (see
Figure 7). All together these findings suggest that FOXM1 has a pivotal role in the
accumulation DSB-DNA damage upon epirubicin.
FOXM1 is required for homologous recombination repair

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next analysed a possible role for FOXM1 in DSB repair using HeLa cell lines habouring
an integrated direct repeat green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP) reporter for homologous
recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (33, 34). The I-SceI expression
plasmid was transfected into DR-GFP HeLa cells with the non-specific (NS), FOXM1, or
BRCA1 siRNA and the percentage of GFP-positive cells measured by flow cytometric
analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). The knockdown of BRCA1 significantly decreased the
percentage of GFP-positive cells in comparison with non-specific (NS) control siRNA in
both DR-GFP reporter systems for HR (34.2%) and NHEJ (31.6%) (Figure 5B). Likewise,
FOXM1 depletion using siRNA reduced the HR DSB repair (38.9%) by 61.1%, but had no
significant effects on NHEJ repair (Figure 5B). These observations suggest that similar to
BRCA1, FOXM1 contributes to HR-directed DSB repair. Consistent with the fact that
homologous recombination (HR)-deficient cells are more sensitive to blockade of the base
excision repair pathway through inhibition of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
activity (35), the Foxm1−/− MEFs were more sensitive to PARP inhibitors, olaparib and
veliparib, compared to WT MEFs (Supplementary Figure S3), further suggesting that
FOXM1 has a crucial role in HR.
FOXM1 modulates the expression of BRIP1 at protein and mRNA levels
The BRIP1 protein interacts with BRCA1 and is required for the HR DSB repair activity of
BRCA1 (29, 31). To explore the possibility that FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 expression, we
investigated the expression patterns of FOXM1 and BRIP1 in MCF-7 and MCF-7 EpiR cells
in response to epirubicin treatment. Western blot analyses showed that the expression levels
of BRIP1 protein decreased in response to epirubicin in MCF-7 cells, but remained at high
levels in the resistant MCF-7 EpiR cells, displaying similar kinetics as FOXM1 and its target
PLK upon epirubicin treatment (Figure 6A). Cleaved PARP was also included as a marker
for apoptosis. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the BRIP1 mRNA also followed similar
kinetics as the FOXM1 and PLK mRNA, suggesting FOXM1 may regulate BRIP1
expression (Figure 6B). To test this notion, both MCF-7 and MCF-7 EpiR cells were
transfected with non-targeting control (NS) or FOXM1 siRNA pools for 48 h and then
treated with epirubicin for 0, 24 and 48 h (Figure 6C and D). Silencing the expression of
FOXM1 caused a reduction in both BRIP1 protein and mRNA levels before and after

epirubicin treatment in MCF-7 and MCF-7 EpiR cells. These data clearly suggest that
FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 expression at the transcription and translation levels in MCF-7 and
MCF-7 EpiR breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with this idea, Foxm1−/− MEFs also express
lower levels of BRIP1 compared with WT MEFs (Supplementary Figure S4).
FOXM1 activates BRIP1 through a forkhead responsive element in its promoter

We next overexpressed the wild-type (WT) FOXM1 and a constitutively active ΔN-FOXM1
(15), which lacks the FOXM1 N-terminal repressor domain, in the MCF-7 cells. The result
showed that overexpression of WT or ΔN-FOXM1 caused an induction of BRIP1 mRNA
and protein expression levels in MCF-7 cells (Figure 7A). It is notable that BRIP1 levels
decrease regardless of FOXM1 or deltaNFOXM1 overexpression after 48h of epirubicin
treatment within MCF7 cells. This is likely to be due to the fact that both FOXM1 and
BRIP1 are also regulated at post-transcriptional levels in response to epirubicin as reported
recently (36) and as revealed by their differential mRNA and protein expression kinetics in
response to epirubcin (Figure 7A). To investigate if the regulation of BRIP1 by FOXM1 is
at the promoter level, MCF-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with the constitutively
active FOXM1 expression construct ΔN-FOXM1 and a luciferase reporter gene under the
control of a 2.1kb human BRIP1 gene region upstream of the putative transcriptional start
site (Figure 7B). We observed a dose-dependent increase in the BRIP1 (2.1kb)-luciferase
activity (1.7-4.6×) with the increasing amounts of ΔN-FOXM1 expression vector
transfected, indicating the putative BRIP1 promoter is responsive to FOXM1 induction. We
then examined the ability of FOXM1 to transactivate a 5′-truncated wild-type (WT) BRIP1
(0.4kb) promoter as well as a mutant (mut) BRIP1 (0.4kb) promoter with a putative FHRE
(forkhead response element) (−337bp) mutated. The results showed that while the (WT)
BRIP1 (0.4kb) promoter increased with titrated amounts of ΔN-FOXM1 (1.5-10.1×), the
mutant (mut) BRIP1 (0.4kb) promoter was not inducible by ΔN-FOXM1 and had little
promoter activity (Figure 7C). Collectively, these results suggest that FOXM1 is able to
transactivate BRIP1 promoter via the FHRE located at position −337 bp, further confirming
that BRIP1 is a target gene of FOXM1. To confirm further that FOXM1 binds to the FHRE
of the endogenous BRIP1 promoter, we studied the in vivo occupancy of FHRE region of the
BRIP1 promoter by FOXM1 using Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) before and after
16 h epirubicin treatment in both the MCF-7 and MCF-7 EpiR cells. The ChIP analysis
showed that FOXM1 is recruited to the endogenous FHRE in both the MCF-7 and MCF-7
EpiR and its binding to the FHRE increases in response to epirubicin (Figure 7D).
BRIP1 is the FOXM1 target involved in epirubicin-induced DSB repair and resistance
After establishing that BRIP1 is a direct transcriptional target of FOXM1, we next tested if
BRIP1 could account for the DNA repair and epirubicin resistant function of FOXM1. To
this end, we examined if overexpression of BRIP1 can override the defects in DSB repair, as
reflected by the abnormal accumulation of γH2AX foci in Foxm1−/− MEFs. Interestingly,
we found that similar to FOXM1 (Figure 5A), overexpression of BRIP1 in Foxm1-deficient
cells was able to significantly reduce γH2AX foci accumulation, when compared to those
neighbouring non-transfected cells and those transfected with the empty pmCherry vector
(Figure 8A and 8B), confirming that BRIP1 has a central role in DSB response (26, 27)
following epirubicin treatment. Consistently, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of BRIP1
was able to significantly increase γH2AX foci formation in comparison with cells
transfected with the non-specific siRNA (Supplementary Figure S5A). Moreover, SRB cell
viability assays revealed that knockdown of FOXM1 or BRIP1 (Supplementary Figure
S5B), was able to resensitise MCF-7 EpiR cells to epirubicin treatment, further showing that
FOXM1 and BRIP1 function together in response to epirubicin. To address further the role
of BRIP1 on the repair of DSBs by HR, we used the HeLa cell lines integrating the DRGFP-HR expression vector. We observed that overexpression of FOXM1 or BRIP1

increases the DSB repair via HR (Figure 8C, left panel; Supplementary Figure S6 and S7).
In contrast, depletion of FOXM1 and BRIP1 by siRNA, significantly reduced the ability of
cells to repair DNA via HR (Figure 8C, middle panel; Supplementary Figure S6 and S7).
Importantly, BRIP1 overexpression in the presence of FOXM1 silencing enhanced HR
repair over FOXM1 knockdown, but was not able to restore HR repair to levels similar to
BRIP1 overexpression alone (Figure 8C, right panel; Supplementary Figure S8). Western
blot analysis showed that the low HR repair activity is partly caused by the downregulation
of endogenous BRIP1 through FOXM1 knockdown. Collectively, this result indicates that
FOXM1 mediates HR repair in part through the regulation of BRIP1 expression, but other
FOXM1 target genes are also likely to be involved in HR repair and signalling. Taken
together, our present findings show that FOXM1 is a very important activator of DNA repair
genes involved in the HR, such as BRIP1, which renders cells more resistant to cytotoxic
drugs that cause DSBs.

Discussion

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Epirubicin is widely used in the clinical management of solid cancers, yet the development
of acquired resistance during the course of treatment constitutes a major limitation to the
clinical use of this drug (37). It has been shown that anthracycline-based chemotherapeutics
induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (5). DSBs are among the most cytotoxic of DNA
lesions that exist within the cell and generally their repair is carried out by two distinct and
complementary pathways: HR and NHEJ. Accumulating evidence reveals FOXM1 as a
cellular mediator of chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and resistance in various cancer
types. For example, in breast cancer, FOXM1 has been shown to be involved in the
development of resistance to hormonal (20, 21), cisplatin (15), trastuzumab, paclitaxel (22),
gefitinib (23) and epirubicin treatment (24). FOXM1 has been proposed to have a role in
modulating genotoxic drug resistance but its exact role and mechanism of action remain
elusive. Analyses of epirubicin sensitive and resistant MCF-7 cells revealed that MCF-7 has
higher levels of γH2AX foci compared with the drug resistant MCF-7 EpiR after prolonged
epirubicin treatment (4 and 24 h), suggesting MCF-7 cells accumulate damaged DNA in
response to epirubicin treatment and that MCF-7 EpiR cells may be more effective in DSB
repair. This notion is supported by the alkaline comet assay results showing that MCF-7
EpiR sustained lower levels of DNA damage compared with the parental MCF-7 cells upon
epirubicin treatment. The fact that MCF-7 EpiR express higher levels of FOXM1 compared
with the parental MCF-7 cells in response to epirubicin treatment suggests that FOXM1 has
a role in DNA damage repair and thus in genotoxic drug resistance. Consistent with this,
alkaline comet assays showed that Foxm1−/− MEFs sustained higher levels of DNA damage
compared with WT MEFs following epirubicin treatment. Similarly, γH2AX staining also
demonstrated that Foxm1−/− MEFs sustained higher levels of DSBs compared to WT MEFs
upon epirubicin treatment and γ-irradiation. Furthermore, overexpression of FOXM1 can
decrease the levels of DNA damage and epirubicin sensitivity in wild-type MCF-7 cells, as
confirmed by comet and cell viability assays, whereas depletion of FOXM1 expression by
siRNA can resensitise MCF-7 EpiR cells to epirubicin. Crucially, ectopic expression of a
pmCherry-FOXM1 fusion in Foxm1−/− MEFs could suppress the accumulation of γH2AX
foci, whilst the neighbouring bystander non-transfected cells as well as cells transfected with
the empty pmCherry vector displayed a time-dependent accumulation of γH2AX foci
following epirubicin. Lastly, in agreement with a recently published report which shows that
FOXM1 is important for HR (38), DR-GFP DNA repair reporter assays indicate that
FOXM1 is essential for HR but is dispensable for NHEJ. The finding that NHEJ activity is
unaffected by FOXM1 depletion probably indicates that redundant DSB-repair signalling
pathways exist; however, this does not preclude FOXM1 also having a role in regulating
NHEJ. Notably, the lack of γH2AX foci accumulation in the resistant cells is not because of
the inability of epirubicin to access the nuclear DNA or induce DNA damage, as depletion

of FOXM1 in MCF-7 EpiR cells and WT MEFs can restore the epirubicin-induced DNA
damage, as revealed by comet assays. It is unlikely that it is due to the regulation of drug
efflux transporters by FOXM1, as the γH2AX foci formation rates are at comparable levels
at the earlier time points in both the wild-type and Foxm1−/− MEFs upon epirubicin
treatment and γ-irradiation. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that high
levels of γH2AX foci accumulated in Foxm1−/− and not WT MEFs upon γ-irradiation at the
longer time point of 24 h. The observations that these defects in DSB repair are correlated
with a reduction in cell viability in response to epirubicin led us to consider that FOXM1
modulates epirubicin resistance through enhancing DSB-repair. In agreement, we also found
that FOXM1-deficient cells are more sensitive to other DSB-inducing anticancer agents,
including γ-irradiation, as well as PARP inhibitors, whereas Fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant
breast cancer cells also express higher levels of FOXM1 (Supplementary Figure S9).
Recently, BRIP1 has been found to have a role in replicative checkpoint control, and its
knockdown impairs Chk1 phosphorylation in response to Hydroxyurea (HU) (39). However,
despite the fact that Chk1 phosphorylation is compromised in response to epirubicin in
FOXM1-deficient MEFs, Chk1 phosphorylation was not affected in FOXM1-null MEFs
upon HU-treatment (Supplementary Figure S10). An explanation could be that BRIP1 and
FOXM1 have distinct roles in different checkpoints and DNA damage repair mechanisms.

γH2AX foci formation on the DSB sites is one of the earliest events following the induction
of DNA damage by genotoxic drugs (40). These γH2AX foci help to assemble DNA repair
proteins, including BRCA1, RAD51 and 53BP1, at the sites of damaged DNA to initiate the
HR repair process (41). In search for FOXM1 targets that function downstream of H2AX
phosphorylation, we found that FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 at the protein and mRNA levels
through an FHRE on its promoter in response to epirubicin treatment. BRIP1 is a key
regulator of HR DNA repair, most prominently through its ability to directly interact with
and activate BRCA1. Resembling FOXM1, BRIP1 overexpression decreases the
accumulation of damaged DNA upon epirubicin treatment as assayed by γH2AX foci
formation. Furthermore, like FOXM1, BRIP1 overexpression can increase the HR DNA
repair activity, whereas its depletion by siRNA decreases HR activity. These results led us to
conclude that BRIP1 is a crucial downstream target of FOXM1, which mediates the HR
DNA repair activity of FOXM1. However, it is likely that other FOXM1 targets are also
involved in mediating the DNA damage response. Indeed, a recent cDNA array has
identified a number of FOXM1 targets which have a putative role in DNA damage repair,
but their regulation by FOXM1 in response to genotoxic drugs and their involvement in
genotoxic drug-Induced DNA damage repair are yet to be elucidated (38). Nevertheless, the
ability of BRIP1 ectopic expression to repress the accumulation of damaged DNAassociated γH2AX in Foxm1−/− MEFs confirms that BRIP1 is a key FOXM1 target gene in
DNA damage response. The fact that FOXM1 participates in genotoxic drug-induced DNA
damage repair also suggests that targeting FOXM1 can potentially enhance the efficiency of
genotoxic drug and overcome drug resistance (8, 42). In agreement, the natural compound
thiostrepton has been shown to specifically target FOXM1 and repress its oncogenic
activity. Furthermore, thiostrepton can synergise with genotoxic drugs to eliminate cancer
cells. In fact, thiostrepton has been shown to reduce the transcriptional activity by binding
directly to FOXM1 and inhibiting the association of FOXM1 with its genomic targets (43).
In summary, this study identifies BRIP1 as a key FOXM1 target gene in DNA damage
response and shows that FOXM1 recruitment to the BRIP1 promoter is associated with its
transcriptional activation.

into the Xho I and Bgl lI sites of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega Madison, WI, USA)
using the following oligonucleotides: sense: 5′-TAAATGGCAATGCAAGGTGA-3′ and
anti-sense: 5′-GCTCTGAGCTCCGATTCACT-3′; to generate the 0.4 kb WT and mut
BRIP1 promoter fragments the sense: 5′TACTTTAAACAAACACTAGGGATTTGCTGG-3′ and 5′TACTGTAGGCAAGCACTAGGGATTTGCTGG-3′ primers were used, respectively with
the anti-sense: 5′-GCTCTGAGCTCCGATTCACT-3′ and cloned into the Xho I and Bgl lI
sites of the pGL3-Basic vector. The pcDNA3-FOXM1 and the constitutively active form of
FOXM1, pcDNA3-ΔN-FOXM1, have been described previously (15) and the pmCherryFOXM1 was generated by cloning the full-length FOXM1 cDNA from pcDNA3-FOXM1
into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pmCherry-N1 vector (Clontech). The pcDNA3-mychis-BACH1 WT was acquired from addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA) and the pCMV-I-SceI
has been described (33, 46).
Comet assay
The comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions (pH > 13) by a modified method
by (47). Also see supplementary Materials and Methods.
γH2AX immunofluorescent staining and foci quantification
Cells grown on chamber culture slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) for 15 min followed by permeabilisation for 10 min with
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocking with 5% goat serum for 30 min at RT. The slides
were incubated with primary antibody anti-γH2AX Ser139 (20E3) (Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Following washes with PBS, the secondary antibody Alexa
Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA) was added for 45 min at RT. Cells were then
counterstained with DAPI for 10 min before mounting with Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories). Also see supplementary Materials and Methods.
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed on whole cell extracts by lysing cells in buffer as described
(23). Antibodies FOXM1 (C-20), PLK (F-8), β-Tubulin (H-235) and I-SceI were purchased

purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and PARP from Cell Signaling (Danvers, USA).
The mouse monoclonal c-myc (9E10) antibody was acquired from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish
peroxidase–linked anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugates as appropriate (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) and visualised using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Pollards
Wood, UK).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Complementary DNA generated by Superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT
primers (Invitrogen, USA) was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as
described (48). Transcript levels were quantified using the standard curve method. L19, a
non-regulated ribosomal housekeeping gene was used as an internal control to normalise
input cDNA. The following gene-specific primers were used for human: L19-sense: 5′GCGGAAGGGTACAGCCAAT-3′ and L19-antisense: 5′-GCAGCCGGCGCAAA-3′;
FOXM1-sense: 5′-TCCTCCACCCCGAGCAA-3′ and FOXM1-antisense: 5′CGTGAGCCTCCAGGATTCAG-3′; BRIP1-sense: 5′GATTGATGCCACCCTTACTAGAAAA-3′ and BRIP1-antisense: 5′ATCCAGGGCTTCTTCAGAACAG-3′; PLK-sense: 5′-TGATGGCAGCCGTGACCTA-3′
and PLK-antisense: 5′-GGCGGTATGTGCGGAAGT-3′ and for mice: L19-sense: 5′CCCGTCAGCAGATCAGGAA-3′ and L19-antisense: 5′GTCACAGGCTTGCGGATGA-3′; FOXM1-sense: 5′AGAAATGTGACCATCAAAACTGAAAT-3′ and FOXM1-antisense: 5′GAGGGAGCAGAGGCTTCATCTT-3′; BRIP1-sense: 5′TCACAGGTTTGGGTTGGTACTG-3′ and BRIP1-antisense: 5′TGAAAGGTAGCGCAGAGATTCC-3′; PLK-sense: 5′TGGGTGGACTATTCGGACAAG-3′ and PLK-antisense: 5′ACCCCCACACTGTTGTCACA-3′.

Gene Silencing with Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
For gene silencing, cells were transiently transfected with siRNA SMARTpool reagents
purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA) using Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SMARTPool siRNAs used
were: siRNA FOXM1 (L-009762-00), siRNA BRIP1 (L-010587-00) and the non-specific
control siRNA, confirmed to have minimal targeting of known genes (D-001810-10-05).
Two-step cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation
Dual cross-linking chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using formaldehyde and di (Nsuccimidyl) glutarate was performed on MCF-7 cells, as described (49). Primers used to
amplify BRIP1 genomic region 5′-3′ (−390/−277): AGACTCTATCGCCGGTTTCA and
AAACAAGGGCTCAAGGTACG; CCGATGTCACAGAGCCTTCT and
TACCCAGCTTTGCAGTAGCC (−605/−512). Also see supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Sulforhodamine B assay and cell-cycle analysis
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays were performed and analysed as described (50).
Repair Assays
Homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining cell assays were performed as
previously described (33, 45, 46).

Figure 7. FOXM1 regulates BRIP1 expression through a forkhead responsive element (FHRE)
consensus on its promoter

A. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pcDNA3, (control) pcDNA3FOXM1 or pcDNA3-ΔN-FOXM1 and 24 h after transfection treated with 1 μM of
epirubicin for 0, 24 and 48 h. The protein expression levels were determined by western blot
using specific antibodies as indicated (left panel). Gene transcripts of these cells were
analysed by qRT-PCR (right panels) for FOXM1 and BRIP1 normalised to L19 mRNA
expression. Columns are the mean of three independent experiments in triplicate; bars, ±
