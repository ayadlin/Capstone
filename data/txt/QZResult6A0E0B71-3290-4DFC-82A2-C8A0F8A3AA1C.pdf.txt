BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the activity of 2 schedules of erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy, and the prognostic
significance of serum amphiregulin (AREG) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) in metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS:
A total of 60 untreated patients were randomized to a “continuous” (CON; erlotinib 100 mg daily) or an “intermittent” (INT; erlotinib
150 mg on alternate day on day 2 to 14, then 150 mg daily on days 15 to 21) schedule of erlotinib with a modified XELOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) regimen. Serum levels of AREG and TGFa were determined serially. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 arms. Of the 58 patients evaluated for response, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a slightly higher overall
response rate in the INT arm (66.7%) versus the CON arm (56.7%). At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the median overall survival was
18.8 months (95% confidence interval 5 11.3-22.9 months) and 20.7 months (95% confidence interval 5 12.5-31 months, P 5.19) for the
CON and INT arm, respectively. KRAS mutation did not predict drug response. The 2 arms did not differ significantly in toxicity. Baseline serum TGFa was an independent predictor of progression-free survival, whereas a drop in serum TGFa and AREG levels following
3 to 4 cycles of treatment were associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
The intermittent erlotinib schedule was associated with a higher response rate, although this is not statistically significant. Serum
TGFa and AREG levels have prognostic significance in erlotinib-treated patients with colorectal cancer, and further studies are warC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The development of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has taken a new turn with the recent reports on the DREAM1 and the DUX studies,2
which showed that erlotinib may play a role when combined with either bevacizumab1 or cetuximab2 in the palliative
treatment of mCRC. Studies in preclinical models of CRC have demonstrated an additive to synergistic effect on growth
inhibition when an EGFR TKI is combined with chemotherapy.3 Furthermore, this inhibitory effect could be scheduledependent in CRC cells, such that synergism could be better observed when chemotherapy was administered before the
EGFR TKI rather than concomitantly, whereas antagonism maybe observed if EGFR TKI is given before the cytotoxic
agent.4,5 Drug scheduling may also be important when combining EGFR TKI and cytotoxic agents, as shown in lung cancer models, where an intermittent schedule of EGFR TKI was more effective in controlling tumor growth than a continuous schedule.6 Despite the number of clinical reports on the activity of combining EGFR TKI and chemotherapy in
mCRC, none of them have evaluated the clinical impact of drug sequencing and scheduling.7-13 Moreover, given the high

incidence of overlapping toxicities observed with these
drug combinations, it would be important to investigate if
such toxicities can be ameliorated by novel drug sequences
and schedules.
Although somatic mutations of the EGFR TK domain can be found in 12% of CRC tissues,14 they do not
seem to predict response to EGFR TKI in CRC.15 The
role of KRAS mutation in this setting is even less understood. The HER1-specific EGFR ligands, amphiregulin
(AREG) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa)
have been shown to predict treatment outcome following
treatment with EGFR TKI in lung cancer.16-18 In CRC,
Mutsaers et al reported a dose-dependent increase in the
levels of TGFa and AREG which correlated with the
degree of growth inhibition by EGFR antibodies in models of CRC in vitro and in vivo.19 However, there is no
report to date on the serial changes and prognostic significance of circulating TGFa and AREG levels in patients
undergoing treatment with EGFR TKI for mCRC.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the
activity and tolerability of 2 different schedules of erlotinib
in combination with a modified XELOX regimen in previously untreated patients with mCRC. The other objectives
were to perform exploratory analyses on the prognostic significance of serum AREG and TGFa, and tumoral expression of KRAS mutation in erlotinib-treated patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection and Randomization

Eligible patients had to be 18 years or older with adequate
marrow and organ reserved, and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.
They must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum with evidence of inoperable metastatic disease
that were previously untreated and were measurable by the
RECIST criteria (version 1). This study was approved by the
institutional ethics committee and was conducted according
to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients
gave written informed consent prior to study enrollment.
Registration and randomization were carried out by telephone from the central office of the Comprehensive Cancer
Trials Unit of the author’s institution. A computer program
was used to generate the allocation list, and patients were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment arm.

therapy. Because sequential administration of EGFR TKI
after chemotherapy maybe synergistic on CRC cell
growth,4,5 erlotinib was started on day 2 in both treatment
arms after oxaliplatin on day 1. The dose of capecitabine was
attenuated to less than 2000 mg/m2/day, and 100 mg daily
for erlotinib because of previous reports from phase 1b13
and phase 2 studies, where capecitabine given at 2000 mg/
m2/day was poorly tolerated when combined with erlotinib.12 Erlotinib was given at 150 mg daily when administered on days without concomitant chemotherapy in order
to keep the same total dose of erlotinib delivered per cycle in
both arms. Eligible patients were randomized to either: 1)
“continuous” schedule (CON arm), which consisted of oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) administered over 2 hours intravenously (IV) on day 1, oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2, twice a
day) on days 1 to 14, and erlotinib 100 mg oral daily on
days 2 to 21, in a 21-day cycle; or 2) “intermittent” schedule
(INT arm), which comprised IV oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2)
on day 1, oral capecitabine (750 mg/m2 twice a day) on days
1 to 14, erlotinib (150 mg daily) starting on day 2 on alternate days until day 14, and then changed to 150 mg daily on
days 15 to 21, in a 21-day cycle. The combination of capecitabine (825 mg/m2) and erlotinib (100 mg daily) in the
CON arm was derived from a phase 1b study which found
these dose levels to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
when combined with oxaliplatin.13 The dose levels of capecitabine (750 mg/m2) and erlotinib (150 mg daily) in the
INT arm were derived from a phase 2 study, which found
that the incidence of grade 3 to 4 toxicities were much lower
than if higher doses of capecitabine were used.12
Analysis and Collection of Circulating EGFR
Ligands

In this study, 10 mL of plasma were obtained at baseline
and then around day 1 of each new treatment cycle. The
Human TGFa and AREG DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to quantify serum
TGFa and AREG levels (#DY239 and #DY262; R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) as described.16 In our
study, the cutoff values for describing high or low AREG
level were defined as  or < 10 pg/mL, and for high or
low TGFa values at > or  12 pg/mL, as determined in
the study by Addison et al.16 All assays were performed in
duplicate and the final result was derived from an average
of the 2 measurements.

Study Treatment and Rationale

Based on the results of preclinical reports as discussed
above,6,20 this study hypothesized that an intermittent
schedule of erlotinib might result in a higher response rate
than a continuous schedule when combined with chemo4146

of the KRAS gene was done by polymerase chain reaction
direct sequencing in microdissected tumor cells.
Statistical Analysis and Study Endpoints

Overall response rate of the 2 treatment arms was assessed
using the RECIST criteria (version 1), whereas toxicity
was scored according to the National Cancer Institute
CTCAE (version 3). Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the time from the date of randomization to the date of
death from any cause, whereas progression-free survival
(PFS) referred to the time from randomization to the date
of first documented disease progression or death. The chisquare test and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze the
relationship between categorical variables with the level of
significance set at P < .05. The Kaplan-Meier model was
used to estimate the time-to-event variables, and survival
curves were compared using the log-rank test. The Cox
proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the relationship between survival endpoints, treatment arms and
serum EGFR ligands and other cofactors (age, sex, number of sites of metastases, baseline carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] level, KRAS mutation status, previous surgery
and radiotherapy). All analyses on survival and response
were performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat
(ITT) principle. The “drop” in serum ligand levels was
defined as any magnitude of drop in level. The optimal
cutoff values for the magnitude of “drop” in the level of
serum ligands were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, using serum samples derived
from cycle 3 and 4.
Sample Size Calculation

A randomized phase 2 trial design was used to select the
treatment arm with the higher response rate in the treatCancer

ment of mCRC among patients recruited from a single
center. Using the method by Simon et al,21 the sample
size was estimated to be 60 with a 88% chance of correctly
selecting the best treatment. This was based on an estimate of the lowest response rate of 45% with an absolute
difference of 15% in response rate. Exploratory analyses
on the relationship between the EGFR ligands and KRAS
mutation status with clinical outcome were performed at
completion of the study.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

There were no statistically significant differences in the
baseline characteristics between the treatment arms (Table 1,
Fig. 1), except that more patients in the INT arm had prior
adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The paraffinembedded primary tumors from 44 patients were available
for KRAS mutation analysis, of which 59% (26 of 44) and
41% (18 of 44) of the samples were KRAS wild-type and
KRAS mutant, respectively.
Response Rate and Survival

A total of 58 patients were evaluated for response; 1
patient in each treatment arm was not evaluated. The
overall response rates in the ITT population were 66.7%
in the INT arm and 56.7% in the CON arm (P > .05)
(Table 2). At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (95%
CI 5 2.5-3.7 years), 45 patients had died and 44 patients
had progressed. The median PFS was 10.3 months (95%
CI 5 7.2-15.6 months) for the INT arm and 9.0 months
(95% CI 5 7.2-18.0 months, P 5 .42) for the CON arm.
The median OS was 20.7 months (95% CI 5 12.5-31.0
months) for the INT arm and 18.8 months (95%
CI 5 11.3-22.9 months, P 5 .19) in the CON arm.

These differences were not statistically significant. There
was no difference in the PFS or OS in patients who had
and had not received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, a borderline significant difference (P 5 .05) in response rate
was found between the 2 groups, favoring those who had
no prior adjuvant chemotherapy. It is unlikely that prior
exposure to adjuvant chemotherapy may explain the
slightly higher response rate reported in the INT group.

Prognostic Significance of Serum EGFR Ligands

At baseline, the mean serum levels of AREG and TGFa
were 36.7 pg/mL (standard deviation, [SD] 6 79.6;
range, 0-459.5 pg/mL) and 88 pg/mL (SD 6 268.2;
range, 0-1335 pg/mL), respectively. The corresponding
serum levels of AREG at cycle 3 and 4 were 56 pg/mL
(mean, 57.2 pg/mL; SD 6 139.9 pg/mL), and 54 pg/mL
(mean, 89.2 pg/mL, SD 6 276.5 pg/mL).
At baseline, serum AREG level correlated with
TGFa (Pearson coefficients, P P < .0001). The area under
the ROC curve (AUC) values for serum AREG were 0.53
and 0.34 for serum TGFa were 0.34 in cycle 3. There was
no difference in the serum ligand levels by treatment arm.
The actual number of patients, response rate, PFS and OS
for all patients, and for patients with or without a drop in
serum ligand levels in cycle 3 are summarized in Table 4.
The relationship between serum AREG or TGFa
level (at baseline, and then at day 1 of cycle 3 and cycle 4)
and survival were evaluated in a multivariate analysis. In

INT arm, the sample size was powered to detect a 15%
difference in response rate and hence it was inadequately
powered to detect a smaller difference. The lowered dose
of capecitabine used in the INT arm was derived from the
study by Meyerhardt et al, which found that the combination of a higher dose of erlotinib (150 mg daily) and capecitabine (750 mg bid) was safer and better tolerated than
higher doses.12 The lowering of capecitabine dose in the
INT arm did not adversely affect the treatment outcome
of the patients in this study, however, it may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in the higher
response rates compared with the CON arm. In exploratory analyses, KRAS mutation status did not appear to
affect treatment outcome, whereas serum TGFa and
AREG levels were prognostically significant. Although
this study is inconclusive, the data do raise some observations as discussed below.
The response rates and survival rates reported in this
study compare favorably with studies of XELOX alone.
For example, the overall response rates of XELOX in
phase 2 and 3 studies22,23 were approximately 45 to 55%,
whereas in the current study the response rates of
erlotinib-XELOX combinations were between 56.7% and
66.7%. This suggests that the effect of erlotinib on
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is far from being antagonistic, and may provide an impetus for further evaluation
of this approach. To date, only one randomized study has
been published to date comparing FOLFIRI alone versus
an EGFR TKI (gefitinib) and FOLFIRI in mCRC.24
However, the severe overlapping toxicities of gefitinib and
FOLFIRI could have contributed to the negative result of
that study.

DISCUSSION
This study tested the hypothesis that different schedules
of erlotinib when combined with a modified XELOX regimen might result in different clinical response. The INT
schedule resulted in a higher response rate (66.7%) than
the CON schedule (56.7%), but the difference was not
statistically significant. Although a 10% difference in
response rate was found in this study which favored the

Erlotinib Scheduling in Colorectal Cancer/Ma et al

Figure 5. Graphs show serum amphiregulin (AREG) or transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa) levels for selected patients, with
overall response rates (ORR) of partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD).

The clinical development of EGFR TKIs in mCRC
has been challenging because of the overlapping gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities with irinotecan and fluoropyrimidines. A high incidence of severe diarrhea has been
reported in phase 2 studies on EGFR TKI and chemotherapy (Table 5). Pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions
between erlotinib and cytotoxic agents have not been
reported to date in most phase 1 studies,10,25 except for a
study which found a nonsignificant reduction in erlotinib
concentration in the presence of capecitabine.13 In the
current study, the incidence of grade 3 to 4 diarrhea and
neutropenia was relatively low and compliance to treatment was better compared to past reports. Therefore, the
problem of overlapping toxicities between EGFR TKI
and fluoropyrimidines as experienced in past studies could
well be circumvented by the novel schedules of erlotinib
and chemotherapy.
Although KRAS mutation is an established biomarker of response to EGFR antibodies in mCRC, the
current study does not support such a predictive role for
erlotinib-treated patients. Activating EGFR TK mutations are very uncommon in CRC and do not predict
response to EGFR TKI, whereas phospho-EGFR level
may influence response to gefitinib only at an in vitro
level.15,26 In contrast, the prognostic significance of
AREG and TGFa in predicting outcome following therapy with EGFR TKI has been well investigated in different cancers. Increased expression of these ligands in blood
or tumor tissues (as messenger RNA or proteins) have
been associated with inferior outcome following treatCancer

ment with EGFR TKI in lung cancer.16,17,27,28 The
mechanism of this association is poorly understood, but
the existence of an intracrine feedback response to EGFR
TKI has been reported in breast cancer cells.29
There are few data on the clinical significance of circulating EGFR ligands in CRC, besides the knowledge
that serum TGFa is elevated in more than 50% of patients
with CRC compared with healthy controls.30 Using the
cutoff levels as defined by Addison et al,16 which is the
largest series reported to date on serum TGFa and AREG
in patients with cancer, the current study found that 42%
and 53% of patients with mCRC had increased serum levels of TGFa and AREG at baseline, respectively. Building
on the groundwork by Mutsaers et al19 as mentioned
before, the current study suggests that similar to EGFR
antibodies, EGFR TKIs may possibly induce changes in
the circulating level of TGFa and AREG. However, in the
absence of an erlotinib alone arm for comparison, it is difficult to conclude whether the observed changes reported
in this study were caused by the erlotinib or chemotherapy. It is possible that these changes could partly represent
a pharmacodynamic effect of erlotinib, but this remains
purely speculative.19 Another interpretation is that serum
ligand level could be a marker of tumor burden. Although
the current study did not find any association with objective response, other studies have suggested that serum
TGFa and AREG might predict response to EGFR TKI
in other cancers. Rothenberg et al investigated the changes
in serum TGFa and AREG during therapy with gefitinib,
by collecting paired blood samples at baseline and then 2

weeks after starting gefitinib monotherapy in 28 patients
with metastatic CRC.31 They found that approximately
40% of patients had an initial rise in serum TGFa level
during that 2-week period, but because of the relatively
small samples collected they did not detect any association
with survival. In studies of patients receiving gefitinib for
lung cancer, increased level of serum TGFa and/or AREG
were associated with survival and/or response to gefitinib.17,18 However, none of these studies obtained serial
blood samples during treatment at time points which are
comparable to the current study, making it difficult to
compare the results.
Serial blood sampling showed that in 16 patients
(26%), a transient surge in serum AREG and/or TGFa
could be observed between the first 50 to 100 days of
treatment, which corresponded approximately to cycle 2
and 4 of study treatment (Fig. 5). The number of responders were 13 (of 16 patients, 81.2%) in the “flare”
group and 24 (of 42 patients, 57.1%) in patients without
the “flare” response, but this difference was insignificant.
Interestingly, such a “flare” response has been observed
with CEA among 11% of patients with mCRC during the
initial cycles of chemotherapy, which has been associated
with better prognosis.32-34
In conclusion, both intermittent and concomitant
schedules of erlotinib were active and well tolerated when
administered together with a modified XELOX regimen,
with a (nonsignificantly) higher response rate favoring the
INT arm. This study provides further evidence that erlotinib has meaningful activity in mCRC regardless of KRAS
mutation status when combined with chemotherapy. Serum
levels of AREG and TGFa have prognostic significance in
this erlotinib-treated cohort and further studies are warranted on whether serial changes during treatment could
represent a pharmacodynamics effect of erlotinib in mCRC.
