ABSTRACT
As an ent-kaurene diterpenoid isolated from Isodon eriocalyx var. Laxiflora,
Eriocalyxin B (EriB) possesses potent bioactivity of antitumor and anti-autoimmune
inflammation, which has been suggested to work through inhibition of NF-kappaB
(NF-κB) signaling. However, the direct target of EriB remains elusive. In this study, we
showed that EriB induced apoptosis is associated with the inhibition of NF-κB signaling
in SMMC-7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. With activity-based probe profiling, we
identified p50 protein as the direct target of EriB. We showed that cysteine 62 is the
critical residue of p50 for EriB binding through the α, β-unsaturated ketones. As the
result, EriB selectively blocks the binding between p50 and the response elements,
whereas having no effect on the dimerization or the nuclear translocation of p50 and
p65. SiRNA mediated knockdown of p50 attenuated the apoptosis induced by EriB
in SMMC-7721 cells. Taken together, our studies illustrated that EriB induces cancer
cell apoptosis through interfering with the binding between NF-κB and the response
elements by targeting the cysteine 62 of p50, which highlights its potential for the
development of p50 targeted cancer therapeutic agents.

development, metastasis [8] and chemoresistance [9, 10].
The five members of NF-κB family, known as RelA (p65),
RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-κB1), and p52/p100 (NF-κB2),
are sequestered in the cytoplasm as either homodimers or
heterodimers. Upon activation, the inhibitory subunit IκBα
is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and degraded, which
promotes the translocation of the NF-κB complex into the
nucleus and activates the expression of the target genes
[11, 12]. It was proposed that EriB-mediated apoptosis
of acute myeloid leukemia cells and the ovarian cancer
stem cells was associated with NF-κB inactivation by
preventing the IκBα degradation and the subsequent
nuclear translocation of NF-κB [2, 3]. Interfering with
the binding of NF-κB subunits to the DNA response
element without changing the translocation of NF-κB or
their dimerization was reported to be responsible for cell
apoptosis induced by EriB as well [4, 5]. EriB inhibition
of NF-κB pathway also contributed to the attenuation of
autoimmune inflammation [6].

INTRODUCTION
Isodon species (Labiatae) are widely distributed
plants, many of which are used for the treatment of
cancer and inflammation in Chinese folk medicine. Over
the past twenty years, the structures and bioactivities of
their diterpenoids constituents, especially those with
an ent-kaurane skeleton, have received considerable
phytochemical and biological attention [1]. Eriocalyxin B
(EriB), an ent-kaurene diterpenoid (structure designated
in Figure 1a) isolated from Isodon eriocalyx var.
laxiflora, has been shown potent anti-tumor activity both
in vitro and in vivo, and may be a promising candidate
as an antitumor agent. A multitude of studies have been
undertaken to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
the anti-tumor activity of EriB. NF-κB, MAPK/ERK,
AKT and P53 pathways have been reported, among which
the NF-κB signaling is largely involved [2–7]. NF-κB
signaling regulates inflammation, tumorigenesis, cancer

RESULTS

Though extensive investigations of the mechanism
involved in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling by EriB have
been reported, despite of some controversies, the direct
targets of EriB remain unknown. To address the problem,
we resorted to the technology of activity-based protein
profiling (ABPP) strategy for solutions [13]. A series of
labeled EriB probes were designed and synthesized by
conjugating fluorophore or biotin with EriB. With the
labeled activity-based probes, we investigated the direct
target of EriB and the detailed mechanisms involved in its
anti-tumor activity. Our data showed that EriB covalently
modifies cysteine 62 of p50 through the α,β-unsaturated
ketones and EriB induces cancer cell apoptosis through
interfering with the binding between NF-κB and the
response elements by directly targeting the cysteine
62 of p50.

EriB inhibits NF-κB signaling and triggers cell
apoptosis
To begin with, the effect of EriB on the NF-κB
activity was investigated with reporter activity assay. We
observed that EriB significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced
activity of NF-κB reporter (p65-Luc) in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 1b). Further, we examined
the effect of EriB on the expression of the endogenous
target genes of NF-κB signaling. Western blot analysis
showed that EriB suppressed the expression of RelA [14]
and XIAP [15] in SMMC-7721 cells. The anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, also known the downstream
target genes of NF-κB [16], were down-regulated as

well by EriB when the concentration is over 0.5 μM
(Figure 1c). Taken together, EriB inhibited both intrinsic
and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation.
Then the effect of EriB on cell apoptosis was
checked by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The result
showed that EriB induced obvious apoptosis in ­SMMC7721 cells with a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1d),
whereas no evident cell cycle arrest was observed in EriBtreated SMMC-7721 cells (Supplementary Information,
Figure S1). There are two main pathways involved in
apoptosis: one is the extrinsic pathway related to the
activation of caspase-8, and the other is the intrinsic
pathway regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins and activation
of caspase-9, which converge at caspase-3 and follow
by the activation of executive caspases [17,  18] and
PARP-1  [19]. With western blotting assay, our results
demonstrated that the activation of both caspase-8 and
caspase-9, as well as the cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP-1, were increased in EriB treated SMMC-7721
cells, whereas the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of
caspase-3, 7 and 9 [20], was down-regulated (Figure 1e).
Our findings showed that EriB induces tumor cell
apoptosis as is associated with inhibited NF-κB signaling,
which is consistent with previous studies [2–6].

synthesized (Figure 2) (Supplementary Information,
Figure S2). Typically, the ABP contains three components:
the substrate that binds with the target protein, the
hydrophilic spacer and the reporter, which is either a
fluorophore for direct and sensitive detection, or a biotin
to facilitate the isolation and enrichment of target proteins
in complex proteomes. On the basis of the structureactivity relationship (SAR) studies of EriB [21], we
know that the substitutions at C-6 hydroxyl group exert
minimal implication on the activity. What’s more, the C-6
hydroxyl group is highly chemically accessible. So the C-6
hydroxyl group was chosen as the site for the attachment.
With polyethylene glycol as the hydrophilic linker, we
installed a dansyl tag, the fluorophore commonly used
in biological studies [22], to the C6 hydroxyl group to
yield dansyl EriB (EBF6). Biotinyl EriB (EBB8) was
directly accessed by condensation of biotin with EriB.
EBF7, dansyl EriB with reduced α, β-unsaturated ketones,
was generated by catalytic hydrogenation of EBF6 with
Pd/C under H2, whose stereochemistry was characterized
by NOESY. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized probes
was determined, with the parent compound EriB used as
the control (Figure 2). Both EBF6 and EBB8 exhibited
comparable cytotoxicity toward SMMC-7721 cells to that
of EriB. As expected, EBF7 lost the cytotoxicity due to the
destroyed α, β-unsaturated ketones, which were proved to
be the key pharmacophores for the anti-tumor activity of
EriB through structure-activity relationship studies [21].

Design and synthesis of activity-based
probes of EriB
Though extensive investigations of the mechanism
involved in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling by EriB
have been reported, despite of some controversies, the
direct targets of EriB remain unknown. To identify the
cellular target of EriB and further elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of EriB,
the activity-based probes (ABPs) were designed and

EriB directly binds to p50
Next we extended our studies to elucidate the
cellular target of EriB using the synthetic ABPs. It
was observed that EBF6 distributed in both cytoplasm
and nucleus of treated SMMC-7721 cells (Figure 3a).

To directly visualize the proteins labeled by EriB,
cytoplasmic and nucleic lysates of SMMC-7721 cells
were fractionated and incubated with EBF6 (1 μM),
respectively, followed by SDS-PAGE. The EBF6 bound
proteins were detected with fluorescence under a UV
trans-illuminator (UVP). As shown in Figure 3b, the
cytoplasm and nucleus were successfully separated with
the different expression of β-actin and Lamin A/C as the
demonstration and a specific protein band with molecular
weight of 50 kDa was detected both in cytoplasmic and
nucleic fractions (lane 4 and 9), whereas no any band was
detected under the treatment of either EriB or dansyl tag
alone (DT5, Supplementary Information) (lane 2, 3 and
7, 8). Moreover, the fluorescence of the labeled 50-kDa
protein band was competed off in the presence of a 3-fold
excess of EriB both in cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 3b,
lane 5 and 10), indicating EriB binds with the 50-kDa
protein specifically. When the cell lysates were treated
with high concentration of EBF6 (5 μM), a few proteins
were labeled and visualized, among which the 50-kDa
band appeared to be the predominant one (Supplementary
Information, Figure S3).
As one crucial regulator of NF-κB signaling, p50,
a protein of 50 kDa, dominantly dimerizes with p65
and is sequestered in the cytoplasm with the inhibitory
subunit IκB proteins in resting cells. Activation of NF-κB
signaling pathway leads to the release and translocation
of p50/p65 dimer to the nucleus, and then activates

the transcription of the target genes [23, 24]. So we
postulated that the protein weighing 50 kDa labeled by
EriB was p50.
To verify our speculation, the biotinylated EriB
(EBB8) was generated and incubated with SMMC-7721
cell lysates to directly pull down the potential proteins
bound to EriB, with the streptavidin-coated beads as
the immobilization strategy. As shown in Figure 3c, a
50-kDa protein was captured by EBB8. When the
membrane was subjected to immuno-blotting, the
50-kDa band was recognized specifically by p50 antibody.
Moreover, the interaction between EBB8 and p50 could be
effectively competed by the co-presence of 10-fold excess
of EriB, which was consistent with the results observed
in the competition experiment performed with EBF6, the
fluorophore probe of EriB. The interaction of EriB with
p50 was also observed in HEK293T cells. In HEK293T
cells, treatment of TNF-α caused a decrease of p105 and
an increase of p50 as reciprocation [25]. At the meanwhile
the augment of p50 captured by EBB8 was detected in
TNF-α stimulated cells and EriB competed the interaction
between EBB8 and p50 (Supplementary Information,
Figure S4).
To further confirm the binding between EriB and
p50, purified human recombinant GST-p50 was incubated
with EBF6, with GST protein as a control. The result
showed that EBF6 selectively interacted with p50 rather
than the GST protein (Figure 3d).

EriB interferes with the binding of p50 to the
response elements

EriB covalently modifies Cys62 of p50 through
the α, β-unsaturated ketones

The hallmark of the activation of NF-κB signaling
is the translocation of p50/p65 dimer from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus, and then binding to the response
elements to activate the transcription. We explored the
effects of the binding of EriB with p50 on these events.
We first determined whether EriB interfered with the
association of p50 and p65 in SMMC-7721 cells.
Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that TNF-α
treatment increased the dimerization of p50 with p65,
while pretreatment of EriB exerted little effects on the
amount of p65-associated p50 (Figure 4a).
Next we examined the nuclear translocation of NFκB by immunofluorescence staining of p65 protein. As
shown in Figure 4b, obvious translocation of NF-κB was
observed 30 min after TNF-α treatment. Pre-incubation
of the cells with EriB did not block the translocation of
NF- κB stimulated by TNF-α, indicating that EriB does
not affect the nuclear translocation of NF-κB either.
Subsequently, the effect of EriB on the interaction of
NF-κB with the DNA response elements was investigated
with chromatin immuno-precipitation assay. The results
demonstrated that TNF-α markedly promoted the binding
activity of NF-κB with the promoter of Bcl-xL as
previously reported [26], whereas, which was effectively
blocked by EriB dose-dependently (Figure 4c). Taken
together, EriB, through direct interacting with p50,
interfered with the DNA binding activity of p50 without
affecting the dimerization or translocation of p50/ p65.

Structure-activity relationship studies of EriB
revealed that the α, β-unsaturated ketones were the key
pharmacophores for the anti-tumor activity of EriB as
previous reported [21]. To elucidate the structural basis
of the binding of EriB with p50, in our present study,
EBF7, dansyl EriB with α, β-unsaturated ketones reduced
was created, which, as expected, lost the anti-tumor
activity in vitro (IC50>35 μM in MTT assay) (Figure 2).
Investigations were performed to verify the binding
between p50 and EBF7. As expected, no fluorescence
was observed in SMMC-7721 cells upon the treatment
of EBF7 (Figure 5a). Consistently, the 50-kDa protein
band on the gel was abolished as well from both the EBF7
treated cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions (Figure 5b).
These results indicated that the loss of binding capacity
of EriB resulted from the reduction of α, β-unsaturated
ketones and thus α, β-unsaturated ketones are crucial
motifs for EriB to interact with p50.
α, β-unsaturated ketones are known as Michael
acceptors that potentially capture well-positioned
nucleophiles at its target binding site, and may react with
sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues of proteins [27, 28].
Human p50 has seven cysteine residues at positions
62, 88, 119, 124, 162, 262, and 273 [29, 30]. It is known that
residues 59-71 (RYVCEGPSHGGLP) of p50 constitute
the DNA binding domain of NF-κB [31–34], among which
the sulphydryl group of Cys62 is an important determinant
of DNA recognition by p50 subunit of NF-κB [35].

EriB for 3 h before TNF-α (10 ng/ml) stimulation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-p65 antibody. P65 and the associated p50

by the green and blue fluorescence, respectively. (C) SMMC-7721 cells were incubated with EriB at the indicated concentrations for
3 h before TNF-α stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using p50 antibody. NF-κB -associated DNA was
analyzed by PCR with the histone 3-associated RPL30 DNA as the input.

To investigate if Cys62 of p50 is the residue that EriB
bound with, the mutants of p50 62Cys→Ser ( p50C62S) and
p50 119Cys→Ser ( p50C119S) were constructed. SMMC7721 cells transfected with wild type p50 ( p50wt), p50C62S
and p50C62S plasmids were treated with EBF6 respectively,
and were observed under the fluorescence microscope.
Compared with the vector transfected group, the intensities
of the fluorescence obviously increased in both p50wt and
p50C119S transfected cells, while hardly changed in the
p50C62S transfected cells (Figure 5c), suggesting the Cys62
is required for the binding of EriB with p50.

Compared with the wide type p50 and p50C119S, the

which confirmed EriB bound to the cysteine 62 of p50.
The covalent modification of cysteine 62 of p50 by EriB
was further confirmed by mass spectra analysis. As
shown in Figure 5e, a 344 Da increase (the molecular
weight of EriB) was found at the Cys62 of the peptide
(YVCEGPSHGGLPGASSEK) of p50 (Figure 5e).
Besides, the binding model of EriB to p50 was
demonstrated based on molecular docking. As shown in

and the following favorable interaction between EriB and

curve and the blue curve in Figure 6b). The IC50 of EriB
toward cells transfected with p50 siRNA was determined
using MTT assay (Figure 6c), with scrambled siRNA
as the control. As the result showed, transfection of p50
siRNA attenuated efficiently the cytotoxic activity of EriB,
though not remarkable due to probably the relatively low
efficiency of interference. Cell apoptosis assay revealed
that the apoptotic effect of EriB was markedly weakened
in SMMC-7721 cells with p50 knocked down by siRNA
(Figure 6d). Furthermore, the intensity of the fluorescence
of bound EriB to p50 decreased obviously in p50 knockeddown SMMC-7721 cells, comparing with the control
cells (Figure 6e). These data suggest that the interaction
between EriB and p50 is required for the anti-tumor
activity of EriB.

P50 knock-down attenuates the cytotoxicity and
the apoptosis induced by EriB
To investigate whether p50 is required for EriB to
exert its anti-tumor activity, cell proliferation was studied
in cells with p50 knocked down by small interfering
RNA (siRNA). Luciferase assay showed that p50 knockdown compromised the NF-κB transcriptional activity
suppressed by EriB (Figure 6a). According to the
growth curve analysis (Figure 6b), EriB showed obvious
inhibitory effects on the proliferation of SMMC-7721
cells (difference between the red curve and the black
line). As a result, siRNA mediated knock-down of p50 in
SMMC-7721 cells eliminated the antiproliferative activity
of EriB, deduced from the cell growth curves (the green

CONCLUSION

inflammation and has received largely the attention
from both chemistry and biology. Though extensive
investigations of the mechanism involved in the inhibition
of NF-κB signaling by EriB have been reported, despite
of some controversies, the direct targets of EriB remain
elucidated, which became the aim of this resent study. Our
findings showed that EriB-induced tumor cell apoptosis
was associated with inactivation of NF-κB signaling,
which is consistent with previous studies [2–6]. We then
synthesized the activity-based probes (ABPs) of EriB
and with the favor of the ABBP technology, we identified
p50 protein as the direct cellular target of EriB in
SMMC-7721 cells.
P50 is one of the key regulators of NF-κB signaling,
which forms either homodimers or heterodimers and
translocates into nucleus and activate the transcription
of the target genes of the pathway upon the activation
of the signaling. Either the dimerization or the cellular
distribution of p50/p65 in our current study turned out to
be not affected by the binding of EriB with p50, which is
consistent with previous studies [4, 5]. It was also reported
that EriB-mediated NF-κB inactivation of acute myeloid
leukemia cells and the ovarian cancer stem cells was
associated with the inhibition of nuclear translocation of
NF-κB [2, 3]. We assumed that the difference could be
due to the different types of cells tested and experimental
conditions, such as the doses and time used for EriB
treatment.
The direct interaction between EriB and Cys62 of
p50 was confirmed in the present study by mass spectra
analysis which showed that EriB directly interacted with
the Cys62 of p50. Based on the kinetic assay with total
nuclear lysates, it was showed that EriB works noncompetitively to inhibit NF-κB /DNA binding in previous
studies [4]. Our data may suggest EriB inhibits the binding
of p65/p50 complex to DNA through direct interaction
with p50.
At the last part, the present study further showed
that the interaction between EriB and p50 is crucial for the
antitumor activity of EriB, which verified that functionally
p50 is the cellular antitumor target of EriB. Downregulation of p50 using small interfering RNA attenuated
the NF-κB transcriptional activity, antiproliferative
activity, cytotoxic activity and apoptotic activity induced
by EriB in SMMC-7721 cells, which might be due to the
possibility that other NF-κB family members, which EriB
cannot interfere with, participate the signaling transduction
and activate the NF-κB pathway [36].
In our present study, a couple of proteins appeared
relatively weakly on the gel when pulled down with the
dansyl EriB besides p50. Though we couldn’t ruled out
the possibility that EriB may also covalently bind with
other proteins at the moment (Supplementary Information,
Figure S3), we propose p50 is the major antitumor target
of EriB based on our findings.

Activity-based protein profiling is a forwardchemical proteomic tool that uses specially designed
chemical probes to fish mechanistically-related protein
[13, 37]. With the favor of the technology, we identified
p50 protein as the direct target of EriB for the first time and
illustrated the structural basis for their binding. The fact
that EriB has already proved to be effective suppressing
tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo highlights that p50
may be a very promising drug target for cancer therapy
and EriB can be used as a natural chemical template for
the development of p50 targeted therapeutic agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of EriB and synthesis of the ABPs
Synthetic schemes, experimental procedures and
characterization data of all new compounds are detailed in
Supplementary Information.

Cells and plasmids
Hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 and
HEK293T cells were obtained from Shanghai cell bank
in China. All the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 or
DMEM medium (HyClone, Logan, UT), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT),
100 units/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin
(HyClone) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. p50wt, p50C62S and p50C119S were constructed by
site-directed mutagenesis based on pCMV-p105 (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL).

MTT assay
Cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by
MTT method. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well
plates 12 h before treatment and continuously exposed
to test compounds for 48 h. Then MTT (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) was added to each well. The samples were
incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and formazan produced was
dissolved by the addition of 200 μL/well of Trevogen,
followed by a further incubation at 37 °C overnight in the
dark. The optical density (OD) was measured at 595 nm
using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
IC50 values are calculated from appropriate dose-response
curves.

Cell apoptosis analysis
Cell apoptosis was analyzed using the Annexin
V-FITC/PI Apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were

seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1.2×106 cells/
well. After indicated treatment cells were collected and
then washed twice with cold PBS, and then resuspended
in a binding buffer containing Annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodine (PI). After incubation for 15 minutes
at room temperature in the dark, the fluorescent intensity
was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Total cell extracts were lysed and precipitated with
biotinyl-EriB for 2 h at room temperature, followed by
addition of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) at 4 °C overnight. After
washing for five times with the lysis buffer, the beads
were boiled in the presence of the SDS sample buffer.
The proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and the specific binding proteins were detected with
coomassie brilliant blue or p50 antibody (Epitomics,
Burlingame, California).

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed in SDS sample
buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2%
SDS, 50 mM DTT and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20
and incubated at 4 °C overnight with the following
antibodies: anti-bcl-2 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-bcl-xL
(Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p65 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-XIAP
(Epitomics), anti-survivin (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-caspase
3 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Santa Cruz,
CA), anti-caspase 9 (Epitomics), anti-caspase 8 (Santa
Cruz, CA), anti-PARP-1 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Lamin
A/C (Epitomics) and against β-actin (Santa Cruz, CA),
followed by the corresponding horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins of interest were
visualized and imaged under chemi-luminescent detection
using LASmini 4000 (GE Healthcare).

Co-immunoprecipitation assay
Extracts of SMMC-7721 cells were incubated with
anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h, and then
incubated with protein G plus/protein A agarose (Santa
Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed five
times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
NP-40 and subjected to Western blotting analysis.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells were grown on chamber slides for 18 h
before treatment. Drug-treated cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes. After being washed in
PBS, the slides were treated by 0.1 % Triton-X, blocked with
3% BSA in PBS, incubated with anti-p65 antibody (Santa
Cruz, CA) overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated
with corresponding FITC conjugated secondary antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The slides were then incubated
with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 minutes
and observed under microscopy (Eclipse Ti, Nikon).

Cell transfection and luciferase reporter assay
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with
p65-Luc (Beyotime Institute for Biotechnology, China)
and pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 h in
a 48-well plate. Cells were incubated with compounds for
1 h and subsequently activated with TNF-α (Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ). Luciferase activities were measured
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
ChIP was performed in SMMC-7721 cells
using SimpleChIP® Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Cell
Signaling Technology, Trask Lane Danvers, MA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified
DNA was subjected to PCR amplification using the
human Bcl-xL promoter specific primers [38]. forward
5’-GCACCACCTACATTCAAATCC-3’ and reverse
5’-CGATGGAGGAGGAAGCAAGC-3’. PCR fragments
were analyzed on agarose gel and the size (251 bp) was
compared to a molecular weight marker.

Nuclear and cytoplasmlic fractionation
Collected cells were lysed in lysis buffer A
(10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
DTT, pH 7.9) with 0.4% Nonidet P-40 and EDTA-free
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) for 10 minutes on ice. After being microcentrifuged
for 5 minutes at 500 g, the supernatants were collected
as cytoplasmic extracts. Pellets were resuspended in
lysis buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl,
0.5 mM  DTT, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 25% glycerol), and
incubated for 30 minutes on ice. After being centrifuged
at 12,000 g for 10 minutes, supernatants were collected.

The detailed protocols were described in Supporting
Information.

Molecular modeling of EriB with p50
EriB was prepared (generating stereoisomers and
valid single 3D conformers) by means of the Ligand
Preparation module in Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys).
The crystal structure of p50 was retrieved from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB entry: 3GUT). All crystallographic water
molecules and DNA were removed from the coordinate
set. Gold 4.0 (CCDC) was used for docking. The DNA
binding domain, amino acids 59–71, was defined as the
binding pocket on the basis of the previous studies[31–34].
In the docking process, the standard docking score was
used to rank the docking conformations. All the parameters
were set as the default values, except that a maximum
number of 300,000 operations and a population of 200
individuals were imposed. The GoldScore fitness function
and ChemScore fitness function were used sequentially,
and the best-fitting binding mode was identified.
