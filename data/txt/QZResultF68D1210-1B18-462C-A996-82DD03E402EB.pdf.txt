ABSTRACT
Type XIX collagen is a minor collagen associated with basement membranes.
It was isolated for the first time in a human cDNA library from rhabdomyosarcoma
and belongs to the FACITs family (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted
Triple Helices). Previously, we demonstrated that the NC1 domain of collagen XIX
(NC1(XIX)) exerts anti-tumor properties on melanoma cells by inhibiting their
migration and invasion. In the present work, we identified for the first time the
integrin αvβ3 as a receptor of NC1(XIX). Moreover, we demonstrated that NC1(XIX)
inhibits the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, by decreasing the phosphorylation and
activity of the major proteins involved in this pathway. On the other hand, NC1(XIX)
induced an increase of GSK3β activity by decreasing its degree of phosphorylation.
Treatments targeting this central signaling pathway in the development of melanoma
are promising and new molecules should be developed. NC1(XIX) seems to have the
potential for the design of new anti-cancer drugs.

INTRODUCTION

collagenous domains (Col1 to Col5) interrupted by six
non-collagenous domains (NC1 to NC6) [7, 8]. NC1(XIX)
is a 19 amino acid peptide localized at the C-terminal end
of the α1(XIX) chain. Unlike other FACIT collagens,
α1(XIX) collagen chain has interchain and intrachain
disulfide bonds which allow the formation of oligomers of
different sizes [5, 8]. For our part, we have recently shown
in the laboratory that the 19 amino acid NC1(XIX) forms
intrachain disulfide bonds in solution [9].
Collagen XIX is ubiquitously expressed during
embryogenesis where it is involved in the assembly of
the extracellular matrix. In adults, its distribution is more
restricted: vessels, skeletal muscle, spleen, prostate,
kidney, liver, colon, placenta, breast, neurons and skin
[10, 11]. It is involved in embryogenesis, in muscle
differentiation [12] and in the development of esophagus
[13]. Mice lacking collagen XIX are not viable and die
early, due to abnormalities in muscle development. More
recently, collagen XIX was reported to play a role in the
hippocampal synapses formation [14].

Collagen XIX was isolated from human
rhabdomyosarcoma cells in 1992 by Hidei Yoshioka,
under the name of collagen Y [1]. According to its amino
acid sequence, it was classified in the FACIT family (Fibril
Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices).
This initial classification was confirmed by several groups
[2, 3]. In 1993, Myers et al. described a new collagen
named RH COL [4] which turned out to be the same
as collagen Y, so that, in 1994 the collagen XIX name
replaced the two previous names [5]. Type XIX collagen
has high homology with collagens IX, XII and XVI, in
particular the presence of many well-conserved cysteine
residues [6].
The type XIX collagen is a homotrimer of 400
kDa, composed of the combination of three 112 kDa
α1(XIX) chains. Each chain is encoded by a 250 Kbp
gene (encompassing 51 exons) located on chromosome
6  q12-q14 and consists of 1142 residues, with 5

In 2003, Myers et al. demonstrated that collagen
XIX disappears early in the development of invasive
breast cancer even before invasive stages [11]. This was
the first description of the possible involvement of this
collagen in the control of tumor invasion. By analogy with
other NC1 domains of basement membrane collagens,
we hypothesized that NC1(XIX) could have anti-tumor
effects and demonstrated that it was able to inhibit in vitro
migration and invasion of melanoma cells and inhibited
melanoma growth in vivo [15, 16]. We also showed that
plasmin, a key enzyme in tumor invasion, releases a
peptide derived from the NC1 domain that has the same
anti-tumor effects as the entire NC1 domain [9].
Integrins are transmembrane receptors often
involved in tumor invasion. They are heterodimeric
molecules composed of two subunits, α and β [17]. Antitumor matrikines were reported to bind integrin receptors
but other receptor types are not excluded. For example,
tumstatin (the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of collagen IV)
binds the αvβ3 and α3β1 integrins [18, 19, 20], arresten
(the NC1 domain of the α1 chain of collagen IV) binds the
α1β1 integrin [21], canstatin (the NC1 domain of α2 chain
of collagen IV) binds the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins [22],
tetrastatin (the NC1 domain of the α4 chain of collagen
IV) binds the αvβ3 integrin [23] and endostatin (the NC1
domain of the α1 chain of collagen XVIII) interacts with
the α3β1, α5β1 and αVβ3 integrins [24, 25, 26].
Many signaling pathways are involved in the
different stages of melanoma development, as reported
by Uddensky et al. Koo et al. have shown [27]. The
FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) / PI3K (PhosphoInositide
3-Kinase) / Akt (proteine Kinase B) / mTOR (Mammalian
Target Of Rapamycin) pathway is the most commonly
involved signaling pathway. [28, 29]. This pathway is well
characterized in melanoma carcinogenesis and involves a
phosphorylation cascade well known in the literature [30]
and often activated through integrin binding [27].
The aim of this work was to identify the receptor(s) of
the NC1 (XIX) domain on melanoma cells and to identify the
involved signaling pathway that could explain its anti-tumor
effects in melanoma. We demonstrated the involvement of
αvβ3 integrin and a decrease in the phosphorylation of the
FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

33% (p < 0.05) and 31% (p < 0.05) at 24, 48 and 72 h,
respectively (Figure 1B).

αvβ3 integrin specifically binds NC1(XIX)
Integrins have been demonstrated to serve as
receptors of several matrikines, such as tumstatin or
endostatin. Since integrins require divalent cations
to bind ligands, we investigated the effects of Ca2+,
Mg2+, Mn2+ and EDTA on cell adhesion to NC1(XIX)
(Figure 2). SK-MEL-28 cell adhesion to NC1(XIX) was
significantly increased compared to the negative control,
BSA (p  <  0.001), whereas adhesion was similar to the
positive control, fibronectin. Adhesion of SK-MEL-28
cells was significantly decreased in the presence of
5 mM EDTA (p < 0.001). Cell adhesion was significantly
restored when Ca2+ and Mg2+ were added into the media in
order to counteract EDTA effect (p < 0.001) (Figure 2A).
Likewise, SK-MEL-28 cell adhesion to NC1(XIX) was
significantly increased in the presence of 0.1 mM Mn2+
(p  < 0.001) (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results
suggest the involvement of a cation-dependent receptor in
SK-MEL-28 adhesion to NC1(XIX).
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were preincubated
with monoclonal antibody directed against human αvβ3
integrin and then seeded in NC1(XIX) coated wells for
2 h at 37°C. The addition of the αvβ3 integrin monoclonal
blocking antibody significantly decreased cell adhesion
compared to control (p < 0.001) (Figure 2C), suggesting
αvβ3 integrin as a potential receptor for NC1(XIX).
SK-MEL-28 extracts were analyzed by affinity
chromatography on a NC1(XIX)-Sepharose column.
Proteins bound to the affinity column were eluted with
increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.15, 0.6 and 1.0 M).
Eluted samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE and analyzed
by western blot. The 0.6 M eluted samples revealed a
band which matched the 105 kDa band of the denaturated
recombinant αvβ3 integrin (Figure 2D). This result suggested
an interaction between NC1(XIX) and αvβ3 integrin.
The interaction was confirmed in liquid phase binding
assay. Recombinant αvβ3 integrin was incubated with
biotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide with or without excess of
unlabeled NC1(XIX) peptide. Integrin-peptide complexes
were precipitated using sepharose-streptavidin beads and
revealed by western blot. As shown in Figure 2E, biotinylated
NC1(XIX) peptide specifically binds recombinant αvβ3
integrin (lane 1). The binding is reduced in the presence of
unlabeled NC1(XIX) peptide (lane 2). Recombinant αvβ3
integrin was used as positive control (lane 3).

RESULTS
NC1(XIX) inhibits the migration of SK-MEL-28
melanoma cells
Previous studies performed in our laboratory clearly
demonstrated anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities of
NC1(XIX). These results were confirmed on SK-MEL-28
melanoma cell line. In scratch wound assay, migration of
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells was significantly decreased
after NC1(XIX) treatment (Figure 1A). NC1(XIX)
inhibited melanoma cell migration by 47% (p < 0.05),

peptide. Immunofluorescence studies showed biotinylated
NC1(XIX) peptide (20 µM) (green) fixation on SKMEL-28 cell surface. Competition assay with 10 foldconcentrated NC1(XIX) peptide (200 µM) completely
abolished the biotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide labeling on
SK-MEL-28 (Figure 3A). These data demonstrated the
specificity of the NC1(XIX) peptide immunofluorescence
fixation. As shown in Figure 3B, immunocytofluorescence
microscopy analysis showed colocalization (yellow
staining) between biotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide (green)
and αvβ3 integrin (red) which suggested that αvβ3 integrin
may be one of the NC1(XIX) SK-MEL-28 receptors.
Moreover, SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were
cultured on glass slides, fixed with paraformaldehyde
and incubated with biotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide and
anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (23C6). Competition assay
with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (23C6) abolished the
biotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide labeling on SK-MEL-28
(Figure 3C).

We characterized the expression of integrins at
the cell surface and demonstrated the expression of the
integrin αvβ3 on the cells surface using flow cytometry
(Supplementary Figure 1) and by immunocytofluorescence
microscopy analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover,
flow cytometry studies showed NC1(XIX) peptide
(100 µM) fixation on SK-MEL-28 cell surface. This binding
was inhibited by the addition of cRGDfV blocking peptide
or anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (23C6) (Figure 4B and 4C).

NC1(XIX) decreases FAKY861 phosphorylation,
PI3K P85Y458 phosphorylation and PDK1S241
phosphorylation in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells
It is now well established that the FAK/PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway plays a critical role in the development of
melanoma. SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were incubated
with NC1(XIX) for 1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Expression
of total protein and correspondent phosphorylated protein
were evaluated by western blot. FAKY397 phosphorylation
was not modified even after 60 min of incubation with
NC1(XIX). Total FAK level and FAKY397 / total FAK ratio
remained also unchanged (Figure 5A). By contrast, as
shown in Figure 5B, FAKY861 phosphorylation decreased
gradually after 1 min and 5 min of incubation with
NC1(XIX), while total FAK level remained unchanged.
The FAKY861 / total FAK ratio was decreased by 50%
at 5 min and was progressively restored after 30 min.

cRGDfV blocking peptide inhibits the NC1(XIX)
binding on αvβ3 integrin
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were preincubated
with cRGDfV αvβ3 blocking peptide and then seeded in
NC1(XIX)-coated wells for 2 h at 37°C. The addition of
cRGDfV blocking peptide significantly decreased cell
adhesion compared to control (p < 0.001) (Figure 4A).

measured by microscopy at 0, 24, 48, 72 h respectively. (B) Wound closure was significantly delayed after NC1(XIX) treatment compared

In the same conditions, Tyr458 phosphorylation of the
PI3K p85 subunit decreased gradually from 1 min to
60 min of incubation, while total PI3K p85 level remained
unchanged. The PI3K p85Y458 / total PI3K p85 ratio was
decreased by 20% at 5 min and 70% at 60 min (Figure 5C).
In the same way, NC1(XIX) induced a decreased in
PDK1S241 phosphorylation after 1 and 5 min of incubation,
while total PDK1 level remained unchanged. The
PDK1S241 / total PDK1 ratio was decreased by 30% at 5 min
and remained decreased for at least 60 min (Figure 5D).

The AktT308 / total Akt ratio decreased of 20% at 1 min
and 50% at 15 and 30 min (Figure 6A). In the same
way, NC1(XIX) also triggered a decrease in AktS473
phosphorylation. The AktS473 / total Akt ratio decreased
of 30% at 60 min (Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6C,
mTORS2448 phosphorylation decreased gradually from
15 min to 60 min of incubation with NC1(XIX),
while total mTOR level remained unchanged. The
mTORS2448 / total mTOR ratio was decreased by 25% at
30 min and 60% after 60 min of incubation. In the same
way, NC1(XIX) induced a decreased in mTORS2481
phosphorylation after 15 min. The mTORS2481 / total
mTOR ratio also decreased of 30% from 15 to 60 min
of incubation (Figure 6D).
In the same conditions, Ser 9 phosphorylation of
GSK3β decreased gradually from 30 min to 60 min of
incubation, while total GSK3β level remained unchanged.
The GSK3βS9 / total GSK3β ratio was gradually decreased
by 30% at 30 min, 40% at 60 min and remained decreased
by 30% at 360 min (Figure 6E).

DISCUSSION

We showed that the adhesion of NC1(XIX) on
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells was calcium/magnesium/
manganese dependent, evoking the involvement of
integrins. Integrins play key roles in malignant process
as well in the early stages of tumor invasion as in the
tumor angiogenesis or in the development of metastases
[31]. We identified for the first time αvβ3 integrin as a
receptor for NC1(XIX) by affinity chromatography and
liquid phase assay. This integrin is particularly involved
in tumor genesis and was broadly described as one
of the common receptor of the basement membrane
collagens [32]. In confocal microscopy, we showed a
co-localization of the integrin and NC1(XIX), showing
proximity and interaction between these two molecules
on melanoma cells. Furthermore, the zone of binding
between the NC1(XIX) peptide and integrin αvβ3 is close
to the integrin region of interaction with RGD peptide.

Our previous studies demonstrated that the NC1
domain of collagen XIX had anti-tumor effects by
inhibiting migration and invasion of melanoma cells
without affecting their proliferation [15, 16]. We also
showed that plasmin, a key enzyme in tumor invasion,
generates a peptide derived from NC1(XIX) which
reproduces the same inhibiting effects as the entire
NC1(XIX) domain on the tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo [9]. The aim of this study was to highlight the
receptor(s) involved in the anti-tumor effect of NC1(XIX)
and to elucidate the elicited signaling pathway.
Our present results demonstrated that the NC1(XIX)
inhibits the migration of SK-MEL-28 cells. These
results confirm previous studies from our laboratory
demonstrating anti-tumor activity of NC1(XIX) [15].

Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis. Phosphorylated protein was reported to corresponding total protein.

This was demonstrated by the competition found between
the NC1(XIX) peptide and RGD peptide. Moreover,
other receptors are probably involved since the inhibition
observed was 50% only when blocking αvβ3 integrin.
FAK is a multifunctional protein [33], especially
involved in tumor invasion [29], angiogenesis [34] and
energy metabolism of the tumor cell [35]. This is one
of the molecules activated after ligand fixation [36]. Its
activity is the result of a complex phosphorylation cascade
leading to the activation of multiple proteins in the tumor
process. Activation begins by auto-phosphorylation on
tyrosine 397 following the integrin liganding [29]. Later
on, the auto-phosphorylation allows the recruitment of
Src protein which in turn phosphorylates FAK on many
tyrosine residues (Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861, and
Tyr925) [29, 37].
FAKY861 phosphorylation has been well studied in
tumors and it is clear that this phosphorylation is essential
for tumor cell migration [38]. We demonstrated that
phosphorylation of FAKY861 was inhibited by NC1(XIX)
as soon as 1 min of incubation. Afterwards, this inhibition

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is the starter of a series of FAK partner phosphorylation
inhibitions, which may explain the anti-tumor and antiangiogenic effects of NC1(XIX).
Two main signaling pathways, the RAS /RAF/MEK/
ERK pathway and the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are
activated in melanoma and may explain the progression of
this cancer [39]. After activation of FAK via integrins, the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in the proliferation,
migration, and angiogenesis of many cancers, including
melanoma [39, 40].
Phosphorylation by the PI3K activating subunit
is important, especially for the migration and growth of
tumor cells [41, 42]. Our results show that NC1(XIX)
inhibits the phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit
p85 of PI3K on tyrosine 458. Activated FAK was
reported to phosphorylate the downstream PI3K that,
in turn, activates Akt [43]. Akt is a central enzyme in
tumor invasion, which participates in the regulation of
all stages of tumor development [44]. Inhibition of PI3K
and Akt promoted anoikis and decreased melanoma tumor
growth by inhibiting the Rho subfamily [45]. PDK1

(phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) and the complex
mTORC2 activates Akt through threonine 308 and serine
473 phosphophylations, respectively [43, 46].
As mentioned above, these two Akt-activating
protein kinases are also activated by phosphorylation,
essential for their activity, on serine 241 for PDK1 [47]
and on serine 2481 for mTORC2 [48].
We demonstrated that NC1(XIX) inhibited the
phosphorylation of many partners (AktS473, AktT308,
PDK1S241, mTORC2S2481) of the signaling pathway.
In addition, NC1(XIX) also induced an inhibition of
phosphorylation of the second mTORC1 complex on
Serine 2448. This phosphorylation is involved in tumor
invasion, particularly in melanoma progression [49] and
its phosphorylation is essential for its activity [48, 50].
Moreover, we demonstrated that NC1(XIX) induced
an inhibition of GSK3β (Glycogen synthase kinase 3-β) by
decreasing its phosphorylation degree. GSK3β plays an
important role in the activity of mTOR complex [51]. It is a
serine/threonine kinase initially described in the regulation
of glycogen synthesis [52]. It also plays a significant role
on directional cell migration [53] and is described as a
therapeutic target in melanoma [54]. Unlike most kinases,
GSK3β is activated under its dephosphorylated form.
More recently, Koo et al. have shown that activation of
GSK3β was essential for potentiating the action of antitumoral mTOR inhibitor [55]. The increase of GSK3β

activity induced by NC1(XIX), through a GSK3β
dephosphorylation process, could explain the effects of
NC1(XIX) on mTOR inhibition and could also explain its
anti-tumor effects on SK-MEL-28 and other melanoma
cell lines previously described [15, 16].
GSK3β implication in the mechanism of action
of NC1 (XIX) suggests the involvement of the Wnt /
β-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway is frequently
deregulated in carcinogenesis and is most often of poor
prognosis, in particular in colon cancer [56]. However, its
role in melanoma is still controversial and ambiguous. The
Wnt / β-catenin pathway is sometimes pro-tumoral and
sometimes anti-tumoral in other circumstances. According
to the literature, it inhibits the proliferation and migration
of tumor cells but increases their metastatic potential
[57– 58]. Given the complexity of this pathway and its role
in melanoma, studying the effects of NC1 (XIX) on this
pathway will be part of our prospects.
In summary, we have identified for the first time the
αvβ3 integrin as a receptor of the NC1 domain of the collagen
XIX. We have demonstrated that NC1(XIX) controls the
majority of the partners of the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway by inducing the inhibition of their phosphorylations,
essential for their biological activity (Figure 7). Inhibition of
several participants in a signaling pathway is more powerful
than that of a single molecule [55]. Treatments targeting this
central signaling pathway in the development of melanoma

Absorbance was then measured at 560 nm. To investigate
the effect of divalent cations or EDTA on adhesion, cells
were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 with or

(sc7312 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) diluted in
2 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2 supplemented DMEM
for 30 min on a carrousel at 37°C before adhesion assay.
In complementary experiments, cells were incubated with
0.1 to 10 µg of cRGDfV (Calbiochem™) (blocking αvβ3
integrin peptide).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptides synthesis
NC1(XIX) peptide was purchased from
Proteogenix® (Schiltigheim, France). It was obtained by
solid-phase synthesis using a FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)
methoxy-carbonyl) derivative procedure. It was then
purified by reverse phase high performance liquid
chromatography using a C18 column, eluted by a
gradient of acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid, and finally
lyophilized [59]. The NC1(XIX) peptide sequence was
NPEDCLYPVSHAHQRTGGN. Biotinylated NC1(XIX)
peptide was also purchased from Proteogenix® and had
the following sequence NPEDCLYPVSHAHQRTGGNK-Biotin.

Scratch wound assay
SK-MEL-28 cells were seeded in 12-well plates
and cultivated to confluence in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2. At confluence, cells
were incubated with fresh DMEM without FBS overnight
at 37°C. A homogenous wound was then created in each
well with a sterile 200 μL pipet tip. After washing with
DMEM, cells were incubated in DMEM with or without
20 µM NC1(XIX) for 24, 48 or 72 h at 37°C. Wounds
were microphotographed at 0, 24, 48 or 72 h of incubation
and wound closure was measured.

Cell culture
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cell line was purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). Cell were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal
Bovine Serum (FBS) in Nunclon® 25 cm2, 75 cm2 or
150 cm2 flasks (Dutscher Brumath, France) at 37°C in a
humid atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). All culture media
and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies
(Invitrogen, Strasbourg, France).

Immunocytofluorescence assay
30,000 SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were seeded
on coverslip placed into 24-well culture plate and then
incubated for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS (w/v) and incubated for 10 min
at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were
then incubated with biotinylated NC1(XIX), NC1(XIX)
and/or anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (MAB1976 Millipore,
Molsheim, France) diluted 1/200 in 1% BSA-supplemented
PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS,
cells were incubated respectively with a 1/1000 diluted
Alexa fluor 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibody
(A11057 and A11004 respectively, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA) in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA for 30 min
in a dark chamber at room temperature. Coverslips were
then mounted with aqueous mounting medium (Thermo
Scientific, Villebon sur Yvette, France) and examined using
a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSH710, Carl
Zeiss MicroImaging, GmbH, Germany).

Adhesion assay
For cell adhesion assays, 96-well microtiter plates
were purchased from Dutscher (Brumath, France). Plates
were coated with the different substrates described below,
diluted in carbonate buffer (0.2 M sodium carbonate, 0.2 M
sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) overnight at 4°C. Bovine
serum albumin (BSA) (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim,
France) at 0.1 µg/well was used as negative control
whereas fibronectin (Millipore, Molsheim, France) at
0.1 µg/well was used as positive control. NC1(XIX)
was coated in the same carbonate buffer at 1 µg/well.
Cells were detached with a Versene buffer (126 mM
NaCl, 5  mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES) and
centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells
were then incubated with 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2
in DMEM. After counting, cells were seeded at a density
of 60,000 cells in 100 µL/well and incubated for 2 h at
37°C in 5% CO2. Unattached cells were removed by
washing with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 1.1%
glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing, cells
were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. After
extensive washing with distilled water and air-drying,

Oncotarget

Performance column (GE Healthcare, Orsay, France)
previously functionalized with NC1(XIX) peptide,
according to the manufacturer instructions. Unbound
material was removed with 30 mL of washing buffer
(10 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.6, 1/100
PIC (ProteoBlock Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Fermentas,
Illkirch, France) (w/v) and 0.1% octylglucoside). Proteins
bound to the affinity column were then eluted with
elution buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1/100 PIC (w/v)
and 0.1% octylglucoside) supplemented with increasing
concentrations of NaCl (0.15, 0.6 and 1 M). Eluted
samples were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer with
10 mM DTT, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and submitted to
western blotting using an β3 integrin antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany.

Samples were denatured at 95°C for 5 min, centrifuged and
supernatants were submitted to SDS-PAGE.

Western blotting
SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells were cultured as
previously described in Nunclon 25 cm2 flasks. At
50%-confluence, cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with DMEM without FBS overnight at 37°C.
Cells were then treated with 50 µM NC1(XIX) diluted in
DMEM without FBS for 0, 1, 5, 15, 30 or 60 min. All
flasks were frozen at −80°C until protein extraction. Cells
were scrapped with 200 µL of protein lysis buffer (RIPA
buffer, Sigma, St Quentin Fallavier, France), supplemented
with 1% PIC, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and 50 mM
NaF (Sigma, St Quentin Fallavier, France) and cell
lysate were incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Cellular debris
was pelleted by centrifugation of lysates at 10000 g for
10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration of the supernatant was
quantified using Biorad Protein Assay (BioRad, MarnesLa-Coquette, France) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
For western blot analysis, samples were reduced
by 10 mM dithiothreitol and denaturated 5 min at 95°C.
Samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE (Criterion gel,
BioRad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) (20 µg of total
protein per lane) and then transferred onto membrane
using Transblot Turbo (BioRad, Marnes-La-Coquette,
France). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA
in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mM Tris HCl buffer,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 2 h at room temperature.
All antibodies were incubated in TBS-T supplemented
with 1% BSA overnight at 4°C. Antibody references
and dilutions are summarized in Table 1. After washing
with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with 1/10000
diluted corresponding peroxidase-conjugated second
antibody diluted in TBS-T, 1% BSA for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing, immune complexes were
revealed using ECL prime chemiluminescence detection
kit (GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Flow cytometry
Anti-integrin primary antibody and secondary
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody were used according
to manufacturer’s instruction (Supplementary Table 1).
Cells were analysed by LSRFortessa flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) using a laser emitting at 488 nm
and detecting Alexa Fluor 488 emission with a 530/30
bandpass filter. Ten thousand cells, gated on forward
scatter vs. side scatter, were collected for each sample.
Quantification of integrin expression was performed by
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio of sample /
control. MFI ratio of 2 were used as the threshold for
positivity. Results were analyzed using software Flow Jo
(TreeStar, Inc; SA).

Integrin binding assay
One µg of recombinant αvβ3 integrin (3050-AV-0505
R&D Systems) was combined with 1 µg of biotinylated
NC1(XIX) peptide in 500 µL of Dulbecco’s PBS without
divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+). This mixture was incubated
with or without 7 µg of unbiotinylated NC1(XIX) peptide
with gentle shaking at 4°C for 30 min. 10 µL of streptavidin
sepharose beads (Cell Signaling Technology) were added
to the samples for a second incubation period of 30 min
at 4°C. Samples were washed twice with 1 mL PBS
and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature.
20 µL of loading buffer (500 mM tris, 10% SDS (w/v),
20% saccharose (w/v), pH 6.8, 75 mg bromophenol blue,
5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v)) were added to each pellet.
