ABSTRACT
Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy significantly improves the survival
outcomes in non–small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), but drug resistance commonly
contributes to disease progression and relapse. Recently, accumulating evidence has
indicated that deubiquitinases (DUBs) are involved in regulating tumor cell proliferation,
apoptosis, and chemoresistance. We designed this study to investigate the role of WP1130,
a DUB inhibitor, in regulating cisplatin cytotoxicity in NSCLCs. After being combined with
WP1130, cisplatin sensitivity was significantly increased in A549 and HCC827 cells with
decreased p53 expression, inhibiting their proliferation, but not in p53-deficient NCI-H1299
cells. The synergistic cytotoxicity of the cisplatin and WP1130 co-treatment was abolished
in p53-knockdown cells. Western blotting verified the decreased p53 expression in A549
and HCC827 cells treated with cisplatin and WP1130. The administration of MG132, a
proteasome inhibitor, or knockdown of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked (USP9X)
both eliminated the effect of WP1130 in decreasing p53 expression. Taken together,
our findings confirm that the inclusion of WP1130 is potentially contributes to better
therapeutic effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy of NSCLCs in a manner dependent
on the USP9X–p53 ubiquitination–mediated degradation pathway.

INTRODUCTION

therapy, the long-term survival outcomes of lung cancer,
especially with metastasis, remain poor. Notably, molecular
targeted therapies have demonstrated a positive effect in
improving progression-free survival outcomes in patients
with advanced NSCLC [4, 5], but the incidence of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and the EML4-ALK
fusion gene is approximately 10% and only 4%, respectively
[6, 7]. Therefore, only a small proportion of patients with
NSCLCs would benefit from molecular targeted therapies,
and patients who do not present drug-targetable driver
mutations mostly receive platinum-based chemotherapy.
Compared with other platinum agents, cisplatin has
greater activity and is used in chemotherapy for various

Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1].
According to the National Central Cancer Registry of
China, incidence and mortality attributable to lung cancer
accounted for 73.33% of all new cancer cases and 61.02%
of all cancer-related mortality, respectively [2]. Based on
its histological characteristics, lung cancer is divided into
small cell lung carcinomas (SCLCs) and non–small cell lung
carcinomas (NSCLCs); the latter accounts for an estimated
85% of lung cancer cases [3] and commonly presents
with progression. Despite great advances in diagnosis and

cancers. Cisplatin was used for metastatic cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma and yielded an overall response
rate of 45% and prolonged disease-free survival [8].
Cisplatin was also suitable for treating non-nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, and every three weekly chemotherapy strategy
yielded better 5-year overall survival outcomes as
compared to a weekly chemotherapy strategy [9]. Cisplatin
is used for most patients with NSCLCs and forms the
basis of first-line chemotherapy [10]. Following cisplatin
therapy, the 1- and 2-year disease-free survival rates of
patients who underwent surgery for stage II–III NSCLCs
were > 70% and 50%, respectively [11].
Although NSCLCs commonly have high
chemosensitivity, the unavoidable disease recurrence
suggests cisplatin resistance. Many efforts have been made
to explore the mechanisms underlying lung cancer resistance
to cisplatin treatment. Overexpressed PDA/PD-L1 not only
decreased immunotherapy efficiency, but also increased lung
cancer resistance to cisplatin [12]. In human ovarian cancer,
upregulated zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) resulted in cisplatin
by promoting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1, CDK2)
and H3K27me3 [13]. In bladder cancer cells, the long
non-coding RNA UCA1 increased cisplatin resistance by
promoting microRNA (miR)-196a-5p expression targeting
p27kip1 [14]. However, there remains the lack of an effective
approach for overcoming NSCLC resistance to cisplatin.
Recently, several pieces of evidence have
demonstrated that deubiquitinases (DUBs) are important
for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
chemoresistance. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked
(USP9X), a DUB family member, contributes to
chemoresistance and disease relapse by stabilizing BCL2
family apoptosis regulator (MCL1) [15]. In aggressive
B cell lymphoma, USP9X decreased the degradation
of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to
confer resistance against spindle poison–containing
chemotherapy [16]. WP1130, a selective USP9X inhibitor,
promotes apoptosis and has been considered as a potential
chemosensitizer for combination chemotherapy [17]. Based
on these findings, we designed this study to investigate
whether WP1130 could attenuate cisplatin resistance and
even decrease the cisplatin dosage for treating NSCLCs.

The WP1130 IC50 in the A549, HCC827, NCI-H1299
cells was 2.5 µM, 2.5 µM, and 2.0 µM, respectively.
Following 48 h incubation with cisplatin in
combination with WP1130, A549 and HCC827 cells
presented enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Cell viability
was significantly decreased in the co-treatment group,
and the cisplatin IC50 in the A549 and HCC827 cells was
2.5 µM and 10 µM, respectively, higher than the IC50 of
1 µM and 5 µM in the A549 and HCC827 cells that had
been treated with WP1130. NCI-H1299 cells were more
sensitive to WP1130 than the A549 and HCC827 cells,
but did not benefit from the cisplatin and WP1130 cotreatment (Figure 1B).

WP1130 improved cisplatin resistance by
decreasing p53 expression
Of the three NSCLC cell lines, only NCI-H1299
cells did not express p53; RT-PCR and western blotting
were used to detect p53 expression in the NSCLC cells
and confirmed no p53 expression in the NCI-H1299 cells
(Figure 2A). Furthermore, p53 expression was markedly
upregulated in A549 and HCC827 cells after cisplatin
administration. To further confirm that p53 is a key
regulator of WP1130 promotion of cisplatin sensitivity,
the NSCLC cells were treated with cisplatin alone or
cisplatin plus WP1130 after p53 knockdown. The results
suggested that p53 knockdown eliminated the effect
of WP1130 in increasing cisplatin sensitivity (Figure
2B). Western blotting confirmed the efficiency of short
interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p53 (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, WP1130 co-treatment reversed the effect
of cisplatin on increasing p53 expression, but WP1130
alone did not inhibit p53 expression in the NSCLC cells
(Figure 2D, 2E and Supplementary Figure 2C) and in vivo
(Supplementary Figure 2A).Furthermore, we found that
WP1130 have no effect on the expression of MDM2 in the
NSCLC cells (Supplementary Figure 2D).

The role of WP1130 in NSCLC cell proliferation
and apoptosis
No matter DUBs or p53 is involved in regulating cell
proliferation and apoptosis. We used the EdU incorporation
assay and flow cytometry to determine the effect of WP1130
on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.
Compared with the controls, the proliferation ability of the
A549 and HCC827 cells was obviously reduced following
WP1130 and cisplatin co-treatment, but that of the
NCI-H1299 cells was not (Figure 3A–3C). In contrast to the
proliferation experiment, WP1130 and cisplatin co-treatment
did not increase the apoptosis rate of the A549 and HCC827
cells, but apparently promoted NCI-H1299 cell apoptosis
(Figure 3D). These results suggest that the WP1130
downregulation of p53 expression sensitizes NSCLC cells
to cisplatin mainly by inhibiting cell proliferation.

RESULTS
Effect of WP1130 co-treatment on cisplatin
sensitivity in NSCLC cells
Three NSCLC cell lines (A549, HCC827,
NCI-H1299) were incubated with 0–10 µM WP1130 to
determine the IC50 by CCK-8 assay for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h
(Supplementary Figure 1A–1B, Figure 1A). We chosen
48 h as the incubation time for all the next experiment.
After 48 h incubation, WP1130 inhibited NSCLC cell
proliferation significantly when the concentration are more
than 2.5 μM, but 0–1.25 µM WP1130 did not (Figure 1A).

WP1130 reduced NSCLC cell resistance to
cisplatin in a USP9X-dependent manner

no significant change in cell viability between the
cisplatin-only group and the co-treatment group (Figure
4A). Furthermore, USP9X knockdown increased the
inhibition of cell viability after cisplatin administration
(Figure  4B). Western blotting verified the efficiency of
USP9X knockdown (Figure 4C ). And the expression of
p53 was not altered after transfecting with USP9X siRNA
(Supplementary Figure 2B) as WP1130 treatment).

USP9X correlates with chemoresistance and is
a selective target of WP1130. To determine whether
the deubiquitination activities of USP9X are necessary
for the effect of WP1130, USP9X was knocked down
with siRNA in NSCLC cells. Consequently, there was

USP9X inhibited p53 ubiquitination–mediated
degradation

or WP1130 alone had inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis
in vivo, where, similarly to the in vitro studies, there was
delayed tumor growth and decreased tumor size and
weight (Figure 6A, 6C). The tumor regression rate of the
co-treatment group was significantly higher than that of
the single-treatment groups, which implies that cisplatin
and WP1130 co-administration has a synergistic anti-tumor
effect (Figure 6D). Together, these results suggest that
WP1130 increases cisplatin sensitivity in vivo.

MG132, a proteasome/calpain inhibitor, was
added to the A549 and HCC827 cell culture medium
that had been supplemented with WP1130 and cisplatin.
Compared with the co-treatment group, p53 expression
was upregulated in the triple combination (cisplatin
plus WP1130 plus MG132) group (Figure 5A). USP9X
knockdown eliminated the decreased p53 expression
caused by WP1130 in the presence of cisplatin
(Figure 5B). These results imply that WP1130 increases
p53 degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
and is dependent on USP9X. To further verify this, we
administered tenovin-1, a MDM2 inhibitor that inhibits p53
ubiquitination–mediated degradation, and it significantly
increased the cisplatin resistance of the WP1130-treated
A549 and HCC827 cells (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
A concerted effort has been made to refine the use
of cisplatin in the chemotherapy of NSCLCs over the
years. Unlike molecular targeted therapies that have small
proportions of candidates, cisplatin-based chemotherapy
is administered to almost all patients with advanced
NSCLCs. A meta-analysis revealed that cisplatin reduces
the risk of NSCLC-related death by 27% and increases
the rate of 1-year survival by 10% [18]. Furthermore, a
clinical trial confirmed that cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy significantly improves patient quality of life
[19]. A series of randomized trials with large sample sizes
also demonstrated that cisplatin-based chemotherapy is
associated with improved survival outcomes in NSCLCs
[20–22]
. These studies recommended cisplatin-based doublets
as standard care. However, the increasing cisplatin

WP1130 increased the inhibitory effect of
cisplatin on tumorigenesis in vivo
To characterize the cisplatin and WP1130 cotreatment in vivo, A549 cells were xenografted in to
immunodeficient mice. The body weights of the mice were
not significantly changed at the end of the treatment (Figure
6B). Compared with the control, treatment with cisplatin

resistance limits the survival benefits and promotes tumor
progression and relapse. Improving cisplatin sensitivity
is necessary for prolonging the duration of disease-free
survival and for reducing the cisplatin dosage; the latter is
also helpful for increasing patients’ tolerance by avoiding
serious adverse drug reactions such as nephrotoxicity,
emesis, and renal impairment.
Recently, it was revealed that DUBs affect the
resistance of many cancer cell types to spindle poisons
or doxorubicin by inhibiting ubiquitination-mediated
degradation of key proteins [15, 16, 23]. WP1130, a
DUB inhibitor, has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth
by blocking autophagy and inducing apoptosis [17, 24],
and it reduced chemotherapy resistance of hepatocellular
carcinoma [23]. Therefore, DUBs are considered potential
chemosensitizers or therapeutic targets. In the present
study, WP1130 and cisplatin co-treatment had a synergistic
inhibitory effect on A549 and HCC827 cell viability, but
not NCI-H1299 cell viability. The p53 expression levels
between the NCI-H1299 cells and the A549 and HCC827
cells differed greatly. After cisplatin treatment, p53
expression was markedly upregulated in the A549 and
HCC827 cells but was inhibited following cisplatin and
WP1130 co-treatment. These results suggest that p53 is
necessary to the WP1130-increased cisplatin sensitivity in
NSCLC cells.

Several studies have demonstrated that DUBs
regulate intracellular p53 protein levels. Abraxas brother
1 (ABRO1), a component of the BRCC36-containing
isopeptidase complex (BRISC), stabilizes p53 by
facilitating the interaction of p53 with USP7 to reduce
p53 ubiquitination [25]. Moreover, USP15 knockdown
delayed p53 ubiquitination–mediated degradation in an
obvious manner by accelerating MDM2 degradation in
A375 cells [26]. Based on WP1130 selective inhibition of
DUBs, including USP9X, USP5, USP14, and UCH37, we
investigated whether WP1130-increased chemosensitivity
was dependent on USP9X. Our results show that USP9X
knockdown eliminated the synergistic effect of WP1130
plus cisplatin in NSCLC cells. However, USP9X
knockdown increased NSCLC cell sensitivity to cisplatin,
as it did with WP1130. Together, these results imply that
WP1130 decreases cisplatin resistance by inhibiting the
USP9X–p53 ubiquitination pathways.
Ubiquitination or deubiquitination closely regulate
intracellular p53 protein levels [27]. We used the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 to further verify the p53
downregulation through proteasome-dependent degradation
after p53 ubiquitination. Western blotting revealed that
MG132 reversed the inhibitory effect of WP1130 on
p53 expression in the NSCLC cells following cisplatin
treatment. Tenovin-1, an inhibitor of MDM2 (the most

studied promoter of p53 ubiquitination), protects p53 from
ubiquitination-mediated degradation, and only in cells with
wild-type p53 status. In the present study, tenovin-1 (a wildtype p53 activator) pretreatment decreased NSCLC cell
sensitivity to cisplatin and WP1130 co-treatment, indicating
that the USP9X–p53 ubiquitination/degradation pathway is
necessary for WP1130-mediated chemosensitization.
The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcriptional factor
that promotes apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA
repair in response to cellular stress. Information on the
correlation between p53 and DNA-crosslinking agents
is conflicting because p53 potentially decreases the
effect of DNA poisons, leading to drug resistance [28].

For example, upregulated p53 increased doxorubicin
resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma [23]. Nevertheless,
several pieces of evidence support the premise that
increased p53 expression optimizes cisplatin treatment
efficacy by inducing apoptosis in various cancer cell
types [29, 30]. Several mechanisms are response to the
contradictory role of p53 in regulating cisplatin sensitivity.
p53 overexpression increases chemotherapy sensitivity
by increasing the expression and activation of apoptosisrelated proteins such as caspase-3, caspase-7, and Bax.
However, cycle arrest and DNA repair are increased in
tumor cells resistant to DNA poisons. In the present study,
p53 downregulation did not decrease the apoptosis rate

with cisplatin plus MG132. (C, D) WP1130 and cisplatin were co-administered to NSCLC cell lines pretreated or untreated with tenovin-1.

following WP1130 and cisplatin co-treatment. This result
suggests that inhibiting DUBs leads to p53 tending toward
cell cycle arrest and DNA repair rather than apoptosis.
Moreover, the presence of mutated p53 rendered
the NSCLC cells more resistant to cisplatin and increased
the cisplatin IC50 [31]. Mutation within the P53 gene is
one of the most common genetic alterations in more than
50% of NSCLCs [32]. Therefore, combining WP1130 with
decreased expression of mutated p53 would further increase
the therapeutic effect of cisplatin in clinical practice.
In conclusion, the present study confirms that
WP1130 co-treatment increases cisplatin cytotoxicity
by stabilizing p53 and reducing p53 ubiquitination–
mediated degradation in a USP9X-dependent manner.
The combination with WP1130 potentially contributes to
a better therapeutic effect of cisplatin-based chemotherapy
for patients with NSCLCs.

separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and then transferred to 0.45-µm
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA). The membranes were blocked using Trisbuffered saline (TBS) and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST)
containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h and then
incubated with primary antibodies (anti-p53, -USP9X, and
-GAPDH, diluted 1:1000 in TBST) overnight. After washing
three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Bands
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence in
the western blot detection system. All antibodies were
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).

Ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay
The cell proliferation rate was calculated using a
Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
cells were plated in 96-well plates at 4 × 105 cells per well.
EdU (50 μM, 100 μL/well) was added to the plates for
2-h incubation. After washing three times, the cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Apollo® fluorescent dye
solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added and
the plates were incubated for 30 min, and cell proliferation
was observed under fluorescence microscopy.

Tumor xenograft experiments
The experimental procedures were conducted in
conformity with institutional guidelines for the care and
use of laboratory animals of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Hu Zhou University, Huzhou, China, and conformed
to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications, No.
8023, revised 1978). A mouse model of NSCLC was
established using A549 cells to generate subcutaneous
xenografts. Briefly, approximately 5 × 106 cells per mouse
were injected subcutaneously into the lateral flanks of
immunodeficient mice. There were six mice in each
group. The tumor volume was measured and calculated
as follows: volume = (width2 × length)/2. The drugs were
administered to the mice when the tumor volumes were
about 100 mm3. Mice were randomly divided into three
groups: intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg/kg cisplatin
on alternate days, intraperitoneally injected with 20 mg/kg
WP1130 twice weekly, or co-treated with cisplatin with
WP1130. After 6 weeks, the mice were sacrificed and the
tumor xenografts were harvested.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were exposed to cisplatin [median inhibitory
concentration, IC50 (μg/ml) A549 cells, 2.5; HCC827
cells, 10; NCI-H1299 cells, 2.4] alone or to cisplatin and
WP1130 (A549 cells, 2.5 µM; HCC827 cells, 2.5 µM;
NCI-H1299 cells, 2.0 µM). After 48-h incubation, the
cells were centrifuged and collected. After washing
twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells
were resuspended in 100 µL PBS and incubated with
an Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
apoptosis rate was calculated using flow cytometry.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and subsequent
reverse transcription was performed using a ReverTra Ace
-α- reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
was performed according to the SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit
(Takara, Shiga, Japan) protocol in a Roche LightCycler
system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The primers utilized
for the real-time PCR are as follows: p53: Forward 5′-TCA
