In Vivo Regulation of Human Glutathione Transferase GSTP
by Chemopreventive Agents
Colin J. Henderson, Aileen W. McLaren, and C. Roland Wolf

Abstract
Relatively little progress has been made in determining the in vivo regulation of glutathione S-transferase P
(GSTP), particularly the human enzyme hGSTP1, despite being identiﬁed as a signiﬁcant factor in carcinogenesis and development of drug resistance in tumor cell lines. Here, we report the characterization of a
transgenic reporter mouse that reveals how hGSTP1 is regulated in vivo by chemopreventive agents. Basal
expression was found in crypts and villi of the small and large intestine, bronchiolar epithelial cells, the
epidermis and hair follicles, gall bladder epithelium, choroid plexus, and biliary epithelium. Expression was
induced in different tissues by the antioxidant chemopreventive agents ethoxyquin and butylated hydroxyanisole. However, genetic deletion of the Nrf2 transcription factor, which directs central genetic programs of
detoxiﬁcation and protection against oxidative stress, increased rather than attenuated GSTP1 expression.
In vitro investigations with mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts revealed factors, in addition to Nrf2, that control the
expression of GSTP1, offering further insights into regulation. The new reporter mouse described here provides
a useful tool to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of action of chemopreventive compounds and other
environmental agents. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4378–87. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The glutathione S-transferases (GST) comprise a family of
dimeric phase II drug metabolizing enzymes (EC 2.5.1.18)
whose principal function is to catalyze the conjugation of
reduced glutathione to reactive electrophiles as part of a
cellular adaptive response to chemical toxins and oxidative
stress (1). Glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP) has been
reported to be signiﬁcantly elevated in a range of animal and
human tumor types, although the role of this enzyme in the
tumorigenic process is still unclear; indeed, the endogenous
roles of GSTP have yet to be fully elucidated (2, 3). Cell lines
made resistant to toxic chemicals, including anticancer drugs,
express high levels of GSTP (4); likewise, cell lines in which
GSTP is overexpressed are found to be resistant to a range of
drugs and chemicals (5), even though many of these compounds are not known to be substrates of the enzyme. It seems,
therefore, that GSTP is likely to have actions that are not
mediated by its primary catalytic function (6). This is supported by a growing body of information that suggests that

GSTP can associate with kinases involved in signaling cellular
responses to stress [e.g., Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase (ASK1)], inhibiting kinase function
and suppressing apoptosis (7, 8). Furthermore, GSTP has been
shown to play a role in protein glutathionylation and to be
essential for the regeneration of the active site cysteine in the 1Cys peroxiredoxin Prdx6 (9).
Knockout mice lacking GSTP display no overt phenotype
because of the absence of the enzyme but have increased
susceptibility to chemically induced skin and lung tumors
(10, 11) and are almost completely resistant to the hepatotoxic
effects of acetaminophen (12). Furthermore, when GstP null
mice are crossed to the APCMin line, a marked increased
incidence of colonic adenomas is observed. These, like those
in humans, are located in the rectal area of the large intestine,
identifying the GstP null  APCMin hybrid as a model that
closely recapitulates human colorectal cancer (13).
The regulation of GSTP expression has been studied extensively in mouse and rat, but less so in humans (14, 15). We and
others have previously characterized the human GSTP1 promotor in vitro, identifying a number of elements through which
transcription of the gene is induced or repressed (16, 17). In
particular, it contains an AP-1 site (position 73 to 54) that
has been extensively characterized in a multidrug-resistant
derivative (VCREMS) of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (18).
The identiﬁcation and characterization of an antioxidant
response element (ARE; ref. 19), which potentially overlaps
with AP-1 regulatory sequences, raises the possibility that the
hGSTP1 gene may also be regulated by the Nrf2/KEAP1 system
(20).
To gain further insights into the in vivo regulation of GSTP,
we have generated a transgenic mouse model containing the

during prior testing of the Nrf2 null mice for LacZ expression in
our laboratory (data not shown), so we are conﬁdent that
the LacZ activity detected in hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 (Nrf2/)
mice is derived from the reporter driven by hGSTP1 regulatory
elements.
Mice were kept in open-top cages with access to RM1
rodent food (Special Diet Services) and water ad libitum and
a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All animal procedures were
carried out under Home Ofﬁce Project license according to
the Animal (Scientiﬁc) Procedures Act (1986) and after local
ethical review.

entire human GSTP1 gene, plus 2.5 kb of promotor region,
fused in-frame to lacZ and cloned into the ROSA26 locus
(21). We now report that this mouse line recapitulates the
known pattern of GSTP expression in man and demonstrate
for the ﬁrst time that the expression level of the human
gene can be profoundly induced by exogenous factors
such as cancer chemopreventive agents. These data provide
detail on how environmental factors inﬂuence cancer
susceptibility.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Fine Chemicals
unless otherwise stated. Mirsky's solution was purchased from
National Diagnostics, AGTC Bioproducts.

Treatment of mice
We have previously encountered difﬁculties, including
reluctance of the animals to consume adulterated food and
associated toxicities, when administering ethoxyquin (EQ) and
butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) via the diet. In this study,
therefore, these compounds were administered by gavage over
a shorter period. Adult male hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice (8–12
weeks) on an Nrf2þ/þ or Nrf2/ background were therefore
treated with EQ or BHA by gavage (350 mg/kg body weight in
corn oil daily for 2 days). Control groups received vehicle alone.
For experiments with 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), mice were
treated as above but received ABT (50 mg/kg body weight,
orally) 2 hours before treatment with EQ or corn oil. Mice were
sacriﬁced by a rising concentration of CO2 24 hours after the
ﬁnal dose. Organs were removed rapidly, rinsed in ice-cold
sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and either snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen for microsome preparation or ﬁxed for LacZ
staining. Blood was also collected by cardiac puncture into
heparinized tubes. Plasma for biochemical analysis (undertaken by the Clinical Pathology Service, MRC Harwell) was prepared and stored at 20 C until required. hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
Nrf2þ/þ and hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2/ mice treated with
vehicle, EQ, or BHA showed no evidence of alterations in ALT,
LDH, creatinine, or glucose levels compared with historical
wild-type controls, although they did exhibit a small (nonsigniﬁcant) increase in serum bilirubin (data not shown).

Generation of [hGSTP1LacZ]ROSA26 mice
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice were generated by Taconic Artemis, using approximately 500 bp of the 50 -UTR and the entire
hGSTP1 gene fused to LacZ (Fig. 1). This genomic sequence
was fused in-frame to b-galactosidase, and the whole construct
cloned into the ubiquitously transcriptionally active ROSA26
region in order to optimize the chances of generating a mouse
line in which the expression of the human GSTP gene is
faithfully recapitulated. This construct was targeted to the
ROSA26 region in C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells by
homologous recombination. The line was maintained in the
hemizygous state by crossing to C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice and
the presence of the genetic alteration was veriﬁed by PCR.
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2/ mice were generated by crossing
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice with Nrf2/ mice (22), obtained
originally from the laboratory of Prof. M. Yamamoto and
subsequently back-crossing to C57BL/6 for 6 generations. It
is important to note that the strategy used to generate the Nrf2
null mouse replaced the C-terminal half of Nrf2 with LacZ,
potentially confounding data generated in crosses with the
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 line. However, neither basal nor induced
reporter activity was detected in any of the tissues examined

Preparation of subcellular fractions and
immunoblotting
Microsomal and cytosolic fractions were prepared from
mouse tissues by differential centrifugation according to standard procedures and protein concentrations were determined
using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad). Western
blot analysis was carried out loading 5 mg microsomal protein
per lane and using polyclonal antisera raised against b-galactosidase (Sigma), GSTP1 (BD Biosciences), NQO1 (Abcam),
GSTA1 and GSTM1 (generous gifts from Prof. J. Hayes), and rat
P450s, as described previously (23). GAPDH was used as a
loading control (Sigma). Immunoreactive proteins were
detected using donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase IgG
(DAKO) as a secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECLþ, GE Healthcare) using a Fujiﬁlm LAS-3000
mini imaging system (Fujiﬁlm UK Ltd.). Densitometric analysis
was performed using Multi Gauge V2.2 software (Fujiﬁlm UK
Ltd.).
Tissue sections and LacZ staining
Liver samples were ﬁxed in PBS containing 2 mmol/L
MgCl2 and 1% para-formaldehyde for 3 hours. All other
tissues were ﬁxed in Mirsky's solution overnight. After
ﬁxation, samples were washed 3 times in PBS þ 2 mmol/L
MgCl2, dehydrated overnight in the same solution containing 30% sucrose, embedded in Cryo-M-Bed embedding compound (Bright), and frozen in a dry ice/iso-pentane bath.
Cryo-sectioning was performed using a Model OTF Cryostat
(Bright) set to 20 C. The samples were equilibrated to
chamber temperature for 30 minutes before sectioning.
Sections (10 microns) were cut and placed on adhesion
slides, rehydrated in PBS þ 2 mmol/L MgCl2 for 5 minutes
and incubated overnight at 37 C in X-gal staining solution
(PBS þ 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02%
Igepal CA630, 5 mmol/L potassium ferricyanide, 5 mmol/L
potassium ferrocyanide, and 1 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl b-D-galactopyranosidase). The next day, they were
washed in PBS þ 2 mmol/L MgCl2 and counterstained in
Nuclear Fast Red for 10 minutes. Following counterstaining,
the slides washed in distilled water and dehydrated through
70% and 95% ethanol before incubating in Histoclear (VWR)
for 3 minutes, air-drying and coverslipping using DPX
mountant (VWR). Images were captured using a Zeiss 12
MP digital camera and AxioVision software (v4.5; Carl Zeiss)
attached to an Olympus IX50 inverted light microscope.
Preparation of mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts
Embryos were harvested under sterile conditions and skeletal/connective tissue was scissor-minced then trypsinized in
PBS for 5 minutes at 37 C. Mouse embryo ﬁbroblast (MEF)
medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin) was added to inactivate the trypsin
and the tissue was disaggregated by pipetting before being
centrifuged at room temperature for 5 minutes. The pellet was
disaggregated in trypsin and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C,
then MEF media was added to inhibit the trypsin before
allowing the debris to settle, plating out the supernatant and
incubating at 37 C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

Following attachment, the cells were washed with sterile PBS,
refed with fresh MEF media, and grown to conﬂuency, at which
point they were harvested by trypsinization and passaged onto
fresh plates. Cells were not passaged beyond passage 4. Backup
stocks were frozen at each passage and stored in 90% FCS/10%
DMSO at 80 C.
Induction experiments using MEFs
MEFs (5  105 cells/10 cm2 dish) were plated in DMEM and
allowed to grow for 24 hours before being exposed to fresh
medium containing either DMSO (0.1%, v/v) alone or tBHQ
(ﬁnal concentration 20 mmol/L). After up to 24-hour exposure,
they were harvested and used for preparation of lysates. Brieﬂy,
the cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold PBS and each 10 cm2
dish was covered with 300 mL buffer [25 mmol/L Tris HCl pH
7.4 containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% (v/v)
Nonidet 40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and complete ULTRA protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)]. The cells were scraped into an
Eppendorf tube and vortexed for 10 seconds, kept on ice for 30
minutes, and centrifuged (16,000  g for 5 minutes at 4 C). The
supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and stored at
80 C. After protein estimation, samples were separated by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described.

Results
Hemizygous hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice generated and maintained on a C57BL/6 background were fertile, with normal
litter sizes and sex ratios. The transgene was transmitted in a
Mendelian fashion and the mice displayed no overt phenotype
or welfare issues.
An initial tissue screen characterizing the constitutive
expression of the LacZ reporter (and thus hGSTP1) in
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice (Fig. 2) revealed that the main
sites of reporter expression were the liver, lung, and intestine. In the liver, LacZ staining was only visible in cells in the
periportal area (Zone 1), consistent with reporter expression
in the biliary epithelium. The LacZ staining observed in the
lung was more intense, but this was located almost exclusively in bronchiolar epithelial cells, only occasional cells
being stained in the alveolar parenchyma. In the small
intestine, constitutive expression was noted in the midregion of the villus mucosa, but not in every villus. In the
large intestine, reporter expression was more uniform from
the crypt to top of the villus, but again the pattern of
expression was mosaic along the length of the colon. This
may reﬂect the role of speciﬁc crypt stem cell populations in
generating the mucosal population of the intestinal epithelium or the absence of essential cis-acting elements in
certain cell populations, and has been observed in other
transgenic reporter models (24, 25).
Low levels of reporter expression were also noted in the gall
bladder epithelium, hair follicle, and epidermis and across the
whole of the tissue in heart and kidney, where it was punctate
in nature. The brain, however, did not exhibit LacZ staining
except in the choroid plexus where expression of the reporter
was readily detectable, consistent with literature reports on
expression of GSTP in the human brain (26).

In the light of the above results, and to investigate whether
exogenous chemopreventive agents were able to regulate
GSTP1 expression in vivo, hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice were
treated with EQ or BHA and marked changes in reporter
expression were observed in the liver, lung, and small and
large intestine (Fig. 3A). In the liver, EQ treatment elicited
signiﬁcant LacZ staining in hepatocytes, predominantly in the
pericentral (zone 3) region, but also spreading into zone 2.
Following BHA administration, although signiﬁcant induction
was observed the effects were less marked than with EQ and
were restricted to the pericentral (zone 3) region. Conversely,
in the lung, BHA signiﬁcantly induced expression of the LacZ
reporter whereas EQ did not. Pulmonary LacZ staining was
almost exclusively restricted to the bronchiolar epithelial cells
under both basal and induced conditions, although a small
number of cells in the alveolar parenchyma were also positive
for reporter gene expression in untreated tissue and this

expression increased marginally in response to EQ and BHA
treatment. Reporter expression in the small intestine sections
was marginally induced by both EQ and BHA (more so by the
latter), but remained patchy throughout the tissue and was
absent from some regions even after induction. Reporter
expression was conﬁned to the mid-region of the villus, punctate staining being observed at the base of the crypt and in the
muscularis propria. In the large intestine, patchy reporter
expression was detected throughout the length of the tissue
(but was uniform along the length of those crypts that were
positive) and remained essentially unchanged following EQ
and BHA treatment. Western blotting demonstrated that the
detection of the reporter, as evidenced by LacZ staining (Fig.
3B), generally reﬂected the level of expression of both b-galactosidase and hGSTP1 protein in each tissue (Supplementary
Fig. S1). However, it should be noted that whereas Western
blots involve analysis of an entire tissue, b-galactosidase

staining shows the effects in speciﬁc cell types, often resulting
in different changes being observed between these 2 methods.
Chemopreventive agents such as BHA and EQ are thought to
exert their protective properties through the activation of the
transcription factor Nrf2, which in turn induces expression of
genes that contain the ARE in their promoters. To clarify the
role of the ARE in the induction of the hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
reporter, we crossed the reporter mice onto a Nrf2/ background and repeated the induction protocols with EQ and BHA
(Fig. 3C). Deletion of Nrf2 had no effect on basal reporter
expression in the liver, but resulted in a more marked response
to EQ treatment, leading to pan-acinar staining in hepatocytes
(Fig. 3B and C), although Kupffer cells, stromal cells, and
vascular and biliary epithelium remained unstained. Similarly,
expression was higher following BHA treatment on the Nrf2/
background than in the presence of Nrf2, but in this case it
remained conﬁned to pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes (Fig. 3A
vs. Fig. 3C). In the lung, deletion of Nrf2 made no difference to
basal or induced level or location of reporter expression in the
case of EQ, which remained almost exclusively conﬁned to the
bronchiolar epithelium, but LacZ staining was more intense
following BHA treatment, independent of Nrf2 status. LacZ
staining in the small intestine was unchanged after corn oil or
EQ treatment but was elevated and more widely distributed
after BHA administration (Fig. 3B and C). Both basal and
induced (by EQ or BHA) reporter gene expression were elevated in the large intestine; furthermore, rather than being
patchy or mosaic in nature [as in Nrf2þ/þ (Fig. 3A)], LacZ
staining was found throughout the large intestine (Fig. 3C),
although the lamina propria, muscularis propria, and lymphoid aggregates remained negative. For liver, lung, and small
intestine, hGSTP1 expression mirrored that of b-galactosidase,
as evidenced by Western blotting, although it should be noted
that expression of b-galactosidase and induction of hGSTP1 in
liver after EQ and BHA treatment are difﬁcult to estimate

4382

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

accurately because of the extremely low level of expression of
these proteins in control mice (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig.
S1). Furthermore, in Supplementary Fig. S1, the values for EQ
and BHA are shown with respect to their equivalent control;
however, the fold-change in absolute expression values
between Nrf2 wild-type and null genotypes for b-galactosidase
and hGSTP1 in liver after EQ treatment (1.9- and 2.3-fold,
respectively) are consistent with the increased expression
observed on the Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B).
To establish why deletion of Nrf2 resulted in an increased
expression of hGSTP1, we investigated the role of metabolism
in EQ-mediated regulation of hGSTP1. Western blot analysis of
the hepatic expression of several P450 enzymes following
induction by EQ and BHA indicated that treatment with EQ
increased the expression of Cyp1a, Cyp2b, and Cyp3a at the
protein level but only had a marginal effect, if any, on Cyp2a
and Cyp2c expression, whereas BHA only induced the expression of Cyp2b, and to a much lesser extent than EQ. Nrf2 status
did not affect this pattern of expression (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that differences
between Nrf2þ/þ and Nrf2/ mice in the effects of EQ are
not a function of different responsiveness to P450 induction by
this antioxidant. However, this does not preclude the possibility that P450-mediated metabolism plays a role in these
effects. To investigate this further, we used the cytochrome
P450 inhibitor ABT to interfere with the metabolism of EQ and
determined the consequences for reporter gene expression. As
expected, EQ upregulated reporter expression in hGSTP1::
LacZROSA26 Nrf2þ/þ mice, and reporter induction was more
marked on the Nrf2/ background. In mice treated with ABT
or vehicle, hepatic LacZ staining was completely absent,
regardless of the presence of Nrf2 (Fig. 4B). However, when
EQ treatment was preceded by dosing with ABT, reporter gene
induction was severely attenuated, being completely abolished
in the absence of Nrf2, whereas only a very few LacZ positive

essentially abolished, respectively, in the absence of Nrf2 (Fig.
4A). We went on to investigate the effects of EQ and BHA on
expression of other ARE-regulated genes in hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
mice (with or without functional Nrf2) by means of
Western blot analysis of NQO1, GSTA1, and GSTM1 in cytosolic
fractions from liver, lung, and small and large intestine (Fig. 5
and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Hepatic expression of NQO1 was
signiﬁcantly upregulated by both EQ and BHA in the presence
of functional Nrf2 but was not changed above basal values in
Nrf2/ mice; a similar pattern was observed in the other
tissues studied (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In the case of GSTM1,
basal and induced expression levels in hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
Nrf2þ/þ mice were reduced to varying degrees (but not abolished) in liver, lung, and large intestine in the absence of Nrf2.

hepatocytes were found in mice with functional Nrf2 (Fig. 4B).
These results indicate that P450-mediated metabolism of EQ is
an essential step in the induction of hGSTP1 expression, and
also for the activation of Nrf2 by EQ. Biochemical analysis of
serum from hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2þ/þ and hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
Nrf2/ mice treated with ABT  EQ showed no

Interestingly, this was not the case in the small intestine. In this
tissue, GSTM1 expression was not increased in hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
Nrf2/ mice following BHA treatment, but induction
by EQ was essentially undiminished and thus seemed to be
independent of Nrf2 status. The induction of GSTA1 observed
in lung and large intestine of hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2þ/þ mice
following EQ or BHA treatment was completely abolished on
the Nrf2/ genetic background, although some induction was
observed in the liver and small intestine of this genotype after
both treatments.
To model the regulation of hGSTP1 and the LacZ reporter by
signaling through the ARE, we used tBHQ (the active metabolite of BHA) as an example of a compound that has been
shown unequivocally to act via an antioxidant mechanism. The
regulation of b-galactosidase (representing the hGSTP1::LacZ
reporter), hGSTP1, and various antioxidant response proteins
was investigated by Western blotting in MEFs prepared from
both hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2þ/þ and hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
Nrf2/ mice. Treatment of hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 Nrf2þ/þ
MEFs with tBHQ led to an increased expression of hGSTP1
at 24 h; this increase was attenuated in ﬁbroblasts derived from
Nrf2/ mice, indicating a role for the ARE in hGSTP regulation
(Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S4). The expression of Nrf2 in
Nrf2þ/þ ﬁbroblasts began to be upregulated within 30 to 50
minutes of exposure, peaked after 4 hours and was beginning to
decline by 24 hours. There was also a time-dependent increase
in the expression of HO-1, which increased steadily over the
ﬁrst 24 hours of exposure, whereas there was little or no change
in NQO-1 expression at the earlier timepoints, increased
expression only being detected after 24 hours. In contrast, the
expression of NF-kB and ERK1/2 did not change over the 24hour period of exposure to tBHQ, and while there was
increased expression of both c-Jun and c-Fos peaking after 1
hour, the increase was barely detectable in the latter case.
When Nrf2/ ﬁbroblasts were treated in the same way, the
pattern of b-galactosidase and hGSTP1 expression was the
same as on the Nrf2þ/þ background, whereas the expression of
Nrf2 was, as expected, below the limit of detection (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast with the observations in Nrf2þ/þ
cells, the expression of NQO-1 was completely abolished in
Nrf2/ ﬁbroblasts, and HO-1 expression was somewhat lower,
although it exhibited the same general time course as in
Nrf2þ/þ cells. Protein quantitation shows the expression proﬁle for c-Fos to be virtually identical in mice with and without
functional Nrf2, whereas for c-Jun induction was observed in
both genotypes, albeit lower and less sustained in the absence
of Nrf2 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The expression of ERK1/2 and
NF-kB did not alter from basal levels over the 24-hour period,
regardless of the Nrf2 status of the cells. There was no change in
expression of b-galactosidase protein in untreated MEFs, or
MEFs treated only with DMSO, over the 24 h period (data not
shown).

Discussion
We and others have demonstrated that GSTP can play a
critical role in both chemically induced and genetically initiated carcinogenesis (11, 13, 27). GSTP is also often overex-

pressed in human tumors such as lung, colon, and ovary (28).
Understanding the endogenous and exogenous factors that
control GSTP expression is therefore important in deﬁning
those variables that may inﬂuence cancer susceptibility and
drug response in patients with cancer (2, 29). To that end, we
have generated a transgenic mouse model containing the
complete sequence of hGSTP together with a LacZ reporter
gene to permit histochemical localization of the expressed
products of the transgene. The reporter construct contained
2.6 kb of ﬂanking sequence upstream of the GSTP transcription
start site, encompassing the reported regulatory elements in
the promotor (18, 30) and the entire coding sequence, because
regulatory motifs have also been reported in both intronic and
exonic regions of the GSTP gene (31, 32). We demonstrate that
this model recapitulates the expression proﬁle of hGSTP in
vivo, allowing further investigation about the regulation and
expression proﬁle of this gene, and providing clues to the
endogenous role(s) of GSTP in cellular homeostasis.
Expression of hGSTP1 did not cause any overt phenotypic
changes in the hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice, which bred normally
and exhibited Mendelian inheritance of the transgene. A tissue

Human GSTP Reporter Mouse

screen for b-galactosidase activity found that the reporter gene
was expressed to varying degrees throughout the body, in a
manner that generally reﬂected what had been previously
reported for expression of hGSTP1 (33). In the livers of
hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice, reporter expression was evident
around the portal area and in the epithelium of the gall bladder.
This corresponds with the restricted expression of hGSTP1 in
human biliary epithelium and gall bladder (34, 35), whereas
mGstp1/p2 has been reported to be a major isoenzyme in male
mouse liver (36). GSTP1 has previously been reported to be the
major GST isoform in human lung (37), being expressed
predominantly in the bronchiolar epithelium (38) as observed
in this study. Similarly, consistent with our ﬁndings, hGSTP1
expression has been reported in both villi and crypts of the
small intestine, whereas in the colonic mucosa it was the only
GST isoform identiﬁable (34). LacZ staining was also seen in
the epidermis and sebaceous glands of the skin, heart muscle,
choroid plexus, and kidney tubules, consistent with the pattern
of GSTP1 expression in human tissues (33). In particular,
investigation of the expression of GST in human brain has
indicated localization to interfaces between blood, brain, and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), including the choroid plexus, leading
to speculation that GSTP might function to protect the brain
from blood- and CSF-borne toxins (26). These data are also
consistent with the expression of hGSTP1 measured by quantitation of RNA across tissues as reported in the BioGPS
database (http://biogps.gnf.org; ref. 39).
The pattern of reporter expression in hGSTP1::LacZROSA26
mice demonstrates the dominant effect of cis-regulatory
sequences over the prevailing cellular environment in the
regulation of hGSTP1 expression, the distribution observed
being more reﬂective of the human pattern (reﬂecting the
origin of the construct used) than the mouse pattern (determined by trans-acting factors within the mouse cellular environment). Thus, cis-acting elements in the 50 region of the
human GSTP1 gene are sufﬁcient to establish the human
pattern of expression. The utility of humanized mice for
studying the biologic role of hGSTP1 is illustrated by studies
in which a different humanized mouse line was used to address
species differences in the toxicity of acetaminophen. When
hepatotoxicity because of acetaminophen (300 mg/kg, administered either i.p. or orally) was compared in wild-type,
mGstp1/2 null, and GSTP1 humanized mice, the humanized
mice exhibited a response that was intermediate between
those of the wild-type and null mice, consistent with the
expression of hGSTP1 in nonparenchymal cell types (Kupffer
cells, endothelial cells, and bile ducts) but not hepatocytes in
the humanized line compared with expression in all (or the
majority of) hepatocytes in wild-type mice and a complete
absence of GSTP in null mice (35). The reporter line we
describe will be of utility in the further pursuit of these issues
because the construct it contains includes more of the 50
regulatory region of hGSTP1 and it carries a reporter gene for
localization of hGSTP1 expression as well as the complete
coding sequence of hGSTP1 for functional studies.
Having established that basal expression of the LacZ reporter in the hGSTP1::LacZROSA26 mice reﬂected the expression
proﬁle of hGSTP1, we looked at how this expression could be

www.aacrjournals.org

altered in 4 key tissues (liver, lung, small intestine, and large
intestine) following treatment with the inducing agents EQ and
BHA, both of which have been reported to induce gene
expression via the Nrf2/Keap1 system and the ARE (40).
Interestingly, however, the induction of reporter expression
in both liver and intestine following treatment with EQ or BHA
was potentiated by the removal of Nrf2, a phenomenon that
contrasted with the attenuated expression and induction of
NQO1, and to a lesser extent GSTM1 and GSTA1, in the absence
of Nrf2. It is also of note that the induction of oxidative stress in
the liver, as measured HO-1 expression, is mediated at least in
part by Nrf2, because EQ exhibits both Nrf2-dependent and
-independent action. Conversely, pulmonary expression of
hGSTP1, as determined by both LacZ staining and immunoblotting for the hGSTP1/bGal fusion protein, was unchanged
regardless of Nrf2 genotype. It is interesting to note that both
basal and induced expression of NQO1, GSTM1, and GSTA1 in
the lung was severely attenuated in the absence of Nrf2
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). This may indicate, either
that the ARE does not play a signiﬁcant role in regulating the
expression of hGSTP1, and/or that pulmonary expression is
already at maximal levels, possibly because of a critical role
played by the enzyme in this tissue (11, 41).
There are several possible explanations for these ﬁndings;
for example, Nrf2 may not regulate expression of hGSTP
directly; instead it may affect levels of an enzyme involved in
the metabolism of EQ and BHA or their derivatives. In the
absence of Nrf2, altered metabolism could lead to the accumulation of one or more metabolites that, in turn, result in
increased hGSTP induction through other regulatory elements
such as AP-1 or NF-kB. These data are interesting as they
illustrate not only that chemopreventive agents exert their
effects by multiple pathways in addition to their effects on Nrf2
signaling, but also that GSTP is regulated in vivo by cellular
stress pathways such as AP-1, independent of Nrf2. Our experiments with ABT demonstrate that at least 2 mechanisms are
involved in transgene (and hence hGSTP1) induction by EQ
and that one of them requires P450-mediated metabolic activation. Although the identity of the P450(s) involved is unclear,
it is likely to involve members of the Cyp2b family, because EQ
upregulated the expression of Cyp2b10 in our experiments and
has previously been shown to strongly induce the de-ethylation
of benzyloxyresoruﬁn (42). Furthermore, microarray analysis
of mouse liver following EQ administration revealed a gene
expression proﬁle similar to that observed following phenobarbital treatment: the expression of 70 genes was increased at
least 2-fold in response to PB and 23 of these were also
upregulated to a similar extent following treatment with EQ
(unpublished). The most likely explanation for the potentiation
of GSTP expression in Nrf2/ mice is that both EQ and BHA
activate other signaling cascades, such as AP-1 signaling, and
that as a consequence of the attenuation of the antioxidant
Nrf2 response these stress response pathways are further
induced.
It is clear from our in vitro data that tBHQ is capable of
inducing the expression of hGSTP and that this is compromised by the absence of Nrf2, at least in vitro, suggesting that
Nrf2 can regulate expression of hGSTP via the ARE (Fig. 6 and

Supplementary Fig. S4). Loss of Nrf2 may allow other transcription factors (e.g., Fos and Jun) to access the embedded AP1 site within the ARE (43), thus increasing gene expression. The
contrast between in vitro and in vivo ﬁndings with regard to
increased expression in the absence of Nrf2 may be because of a
lack of the relevant transcription factor(s) in the MEF system.
These data differ from those in a previous report stating that
tBHQ and sulforaphane fail to induce hGSTP expression in
HaCaT cells (44). These differences may simply reﬂect the
different models used: HaCaT is a transformed human keratinocyte cell line and may lack essential metabolic and/or
regulatory factors required for induction by tBHQ and
sulforaphane.
There has been intense debate about the consensus
sequence of the ARE, which apparently varies in terms of
sequence, numbers of elements, and genomic organization
not only between species but also between genes within the
same organism (19, 45, 46). Although a simple deﬁnition of the
ARE is not possible, Hayes and colleagues (20) have argued that
the variable context and content of the ARE lends itself to
recognizing 4 classes of enhancer element:
*

*

Classes 1 and 2 contain the 16 bp extended ARE (50 TMAnnRTGAYnnnGCR-30 , where M ¼ A/C, R ¼ A/G, and
Y ¼ C/T and the 9 bp core ARE is in bold), with or without an
embedded AP-1 site (underlined), respectively.
Classes 3 and 4 contain a minimal ARE (50 -RTGAYnnnGCR30 ), with or without an embedded AP-1 site (underlined),
respectively.

Examination of GSTP promoters in mouse, rat, and human
reveals an ARE within the ﬁrst 150 bp upstream of the
transcription start site in each case; the rodent sequences
consist of a 9 bp core with an embedded AP-1 site, whereas the
corresponding element in the human gene is, under the
classiﬁcation outlined above, a class 3 ARE. It is also noteworthy that the rat GSTP promotor contains a further ARE
approximately 2.5 kb upstream of the ATG. This has been
termed the GPEI (47) and comprises a class 1 ARE. The human
GSTP gene has another ARE at approximately 2,166 bp (44).

In summary, we have generated a transgenic mouse model
that recapitulates the expression proﬁle of hGSTP in vivo, and
shown that cellular levels of human GSTP can be profoundly
affected in vivo by environmental factors in a predominantly
Nrf2-independent manner. These data demonstrate how dietary components and other exogenous factors may, through
modulation of GSTP levels, affect cancer susceptibility and
thus potentially the outcome of chemotherapy. The hGSTP1::
LacZROSA26 model will also be a valuable tool with which
to investigate the endogenous role(s) of GSTP in cellular
homeostasis, response to toxic insults and mechanisms of
carcinogenesis.
