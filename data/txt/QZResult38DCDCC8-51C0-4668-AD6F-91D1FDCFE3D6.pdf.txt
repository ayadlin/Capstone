Abstract
The frequent use of chemotherapy to combat a range of malignancies can elicit severe cognitive dysfunction often referred to as
"chemobrain," a condition that can persist long after the cessation
of treatment in as many as 75% of survivors. Although cognitive
health is a critical determinant of therapeutic outcome, chemobrain remains an unmet medical need that adversely affects quality
of life in pediatric and adult cancer survivors. Using a rodent model
of chemobrain, we showed that chronic cyclophosphamide treatment induced signiﬁcant performance-based decrements on
behavioral tasks designed to interrogate hippocampal and cortical
function. Intrahippocampal transplantation of human neural stem
cells resolved all cognitive impairments when animals were tested
1 month after the cessation of chemotherapy. In transplanted
animals, grafted cells survived (8%) and differentiated along

neuronal and astroglial lineages, where improved cognition was
associated with reduced neuroinﬂammation and enhanced host
dendritic arborization. Stem cell transplantation signiﬁcantly
reduced the number of activated microglia after cyclophosphamide treatment in the brain. Granule and pyramidal cell neurons
within the dentate gyrus and CA1 subﬁelds of the hippocampus
exhibited signiﬁcant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine
density, and immature and mature spine types following chemotherapy, adverse effects that were eradicated by stem cell transplantation. Our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst evidence that cranial
transplantation of stem cells can reverse the deleterious effects of
chemobrain, through a trophic support mechanism involving the
attenuation of neuroinﬂammation and the preservation host neuronal architecture. Cancer Res; 75(4); 676–86. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

exception of survival, cognitive function following cancer treatment may be the most critical criterion for evaluating therapeutic
outcome and for determining long-term quality of life (10, 11).
Chemotherapy can lead to severe impairments in cognition
that persist long after termination of treatment in as many as 75%
of survivors (reviewed in ref. 12). The cognitive domains that are
disrupted are diverse and include memory, processing speed,
attention, and executive function (reviewed in refs. 11, 13).
Although there is growing clinical literature describing this devastating syndrome, often referred to as "chemobrain" or "chemo
fog," the precise mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced
cognitive decline, as well as the contribution of patient-to-patient
differences such as disease status, genetic background, and treatment strategy, remain unknown. While past work has clearly
deﬁned the sensitivity of neurogenic populations of neural progenitor cells to radiation (14) and chemotherapeutic agents
(4, 15), it remains difﬁcult to ascribe the spectrum of cognitive
deﬁcits to the loss of newly generated neurons in the hippocampus. Recent work analyzing the structure of newly born and
mature hippocampal neurons has found irradiation (16, 17) to
elicit marked reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density,
and synaptic protein levels. Morphologic alterations were temporally coincident with impaired cognition (18), suggesting a
cause and effect between altered neuronal anatomy and cognitive
function. This idea is supported by a wealth of data that have
linked perturbations in neuronal structure and synaptic integrity
to the onset, progression and severity of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including age-associated dementia (19–21).
To address some of the unresolved issues regarding the mechanistic basis of chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction and
to provide potential clinical recourse to those so afﬂicted, we
explored the use of stem cell transplantation using a preclinical

Advanced stage cancer treatments invariably involve some form
of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy that are useful in controlling both local and distal tumor growth. Efﬁcacy of these treatments depends on the differential deposition of genotoxic damage between cancer cells and normal tissue, with the goal of
minimizing injury to normal tissue while maximizing the death
of cancer cells. Over the years, oncologists have dramatically
improved long-term survival rates with over 12 million cancer
survivors in the United States alone (1). Unfortunately, longerterm survival comes at a cost, as there are now numerous clinical
(2, 3) and preclinical studies (4–6) that have established the
debilitating side effects of cancer therapies on cognition. The
situation is confounded further by the conspicuous absence of
any satisfactory treatments for reducing the progressive neurocognitive sequelae associated with cancer therapies, and is a
particularly pressing problem for pediatric cancer survivors
(7, 8), where one in 640 young adults in the United States is
estimated to be a pediatric cancer survivor (9). Thus, with the

model of chemobrain. This model has been successfully used to
reverse the adverse effects of irradiation on cognition and has been
adapted here to determine how cranial transplantation of human
neural stem cells (hNSC) might ameliorate cognitive impairments
caused by chronic administration of cyclophosphamide (CYP).
Here, we report the beneﬁcial neurocognitive effects of hNSC
cranially grafted in our rodent model of chemobrain, effects
caused in part, by the suppression of neuroinﬂammation and
the preservation of host neuronal structure.

Animals and chemotherapy
Four-month-old athymic nude (ATN) rats (Cr:NIH-Foxn1rnu,
strain 316; Charles River) were divided into three groups (n ¼ 8/
group): saline-treated controls receiving sham surgery (CON),
cyclophosphamide-treated sham surgery (CYP), and CYP with
hNSCs grafted 1 week following the ﬁnal CYP injection (CYP þ
hNSC). Cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in
buffered saline and delivered (i.p.) in four doses (100 mg/kg)
once weekly as shown in the study timeline (Fig. 1A).

Transplantation surgery
The use of human stem cells was approved by the Institutional
Human Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee. The validation,

expansion, and characterization of hNSCs (ENStem-A; EMD
Millipore) used for transplantation followed previously published procedures (22, 23). After CYP treatment, each rat received
bilateral, intrahippocampal transplantation of 100,000 live
hNSCs (passages 4–8) in 1 mL of cell suspension using a 33-gauge
microsyringe at an injection rate of 0.25 mL/minute. Each hippocampi received 4 distinct injections (total 4.0  105 live cells per
hemisphere) using precise stereotaxic coordinates, as described
previously (24). Sham-surgery controls and drug-treated cohorts
received sterile vehicle (hibernation buffer) at the same stereotaxic
coordinates. Animals were anesthetized using isoﬂurane (5%
induction, 2.5% maintenance; VetEquip).
Cognitive testing
To evaluate the outcome of hNSC transplantation on cognitive
function, rats from each cohort (CON, CYP, and CYPþhNSC)
were subjected to cognitive testing 1 month after transplantation
surgery. Cognitive testing was conducted over 3 weeks and
included 3 different open arena tasks followed by contextual and
cued fear conditioning (FC). All trials were later hand scored by an
independent observer blind to the experimental groups, where the
average of those scores was used to compute all behavioral data.
Open arena testing consisted of novel place recognition (NPR)
followed by a temporal order (TO) then an object in place (OIP)
task. For all arena tasks, a positive score was counted only when
the nose of the rat was within 1 cm and pointed in the direction of
the object. The time spent exploring novelty (place and/or object)
was used as the main dependent measure for all arena testing.
Data were used to derive an exploration ratio calculated as the
time spent exploring the novel object divided by the total exploration time (tnovel/tnovel þ tfamiliar), as described previously (24).
Additional details on animal behavior experiments are provided
in the Supplementary Data.
Graft survival and differentiation, neuroinﬂammation, and
morphometric analyses of neurons
Animals subjected to behavioral testing were segregated equally
for morphometric or immunohistochemical analyses. Procedures
for the assessment of graft survival, differentiation, neuroinﬂammation, ultrastructural analyses of Golgi–Cox impregnated neurons, including dendritic spines, are described in detail in the
Supplementary Data.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out using PASW Statistics 18
(SPSS, IBM Corporation) and GraphPad Prism (v6). One-way
ANOVA was used to assess signiﬁcance between groups. When
overall group effects were found to be statistically signiﬁcant, a
Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used to compare the
individual groups. For analysis of Sholl data (i.e., at speciﬁc
distances from the soma), repeated measures two-way ANOVA
were performed. All analyses considered a value of P  0.05 to be
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Behavioral testing: novel place-recognition task
One month after transplantation, animals were habituated and
tested on the NPR task (Fig. 1B). For the NPR task, total exploration of objects during the familiarization phase was not found
to differ between the cohorts. Similarly, the total exploration time

678 Cancer Res; 75(4) February 15, 2015

spent at either object during the test phase was not found to be
statistically different. Group means and 95% conﬁdence intervals
(CI) for the exploration ratio were as follows: control (CON,
mean ¼ 0.785; 95% CI, 0.58–0.99); CYP (mean ¼ 0.224; 95% CI,
0.017–0.43); CYPþhNSC (mean ¼ 0.676; 95% CI, 0.47–0.88). A
signiﬁcant overall group effect was found (F(2,21) ¼ 11.69; P ¼
0.0004) for the exploration ratio to differ between the groups.
After a 1-hour retention interval, CYP animals spent a signiﬁcantly
lower proportion of time exploring the novel place compared to
CON (P ¼ 0.0005) and CYPþhNSC (P ¼ 0.0043) groups (Fig.
1B). On the other hand, after the 1-hour retention interval,
CYPþhNSC animals did not differ from CON animals. Moreover,
one-sample t tests comparing the exploration ratios of individual
groups to chance (i.e., 0.5) revealed that CON (P < 0.05) and
CYPþhNSC (P < 0.05) groups spent signiﬁcantly more time
exploring the novel place than expected by chance, while CYP
animals explored the novel spatial location less than expected by
chance (P < 0.05). Data indicate that hNSC transplantation
improved exploration behavior after CYP treatment compared
with CYP-treated animals not receiving stem cells.
Temporal order
After NPR testing, animals were habituated and subjected to a
TO task (Fig. 1C). After familiarization with two sets of objects
presented 4 hours apart (sample phases 1 and 2), animals were
subjected to the test phase 1 hour after sample phase 2, using
copies of the objects presented earlier (i.e., 1 or 5 hours before).
Total exploration of the objects during the familiarization and test
phases were reduced signiﬁcantly after CYP treatment (i.e., CYP
and CYPþhNSC cohorts) compared to controls. Animals with
intact hippocampal function show preference for the original (5
hours prior) object.
Group means and 95% CIs for the exploration ratio were as
follows: control (mean ¼ 0.588; 95% CI, 0.40–0.77); CYP (mean
¼ 0.280; 95% CI, 0.13–0.43); CYPþhNSC (mean ¼ 0.538; 95%
CI, 0.40–0.68). A signiﬁcant overall group effect was found
(F(2,21) ¼ 5.894; P ¼ 0.0093) for the exploration ratio to differ
between the groups. CYP animals subjected to exploration testing
spent a signiﬁcantly lower proportion of time exploring the
original object compared with CON (P ¼ 0.013) and CYPþhNSC
(P ¼ 0.042) groups (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, CON and CYPþhNSC
groups did not differ statistically. Data indicate that hNSC transplantation improved exploration behavior after CYP treatment
compared with CYP-treated animals not receiving stem cells.
Object in place
After TO testing, rats were habituated and tested in the OiP
arena. Total exploration times of the objects followed similar
trends as found in the TO task. Rats having intact cortical function
will exhibit preference for those objects that have been switched to
a novel location. While CON and CYP-hNSC cohorts showed
preference for the objects placed at novel locations (Fig. 1D),
neither was signiﬁcantly different than CYP-treated animals.
Furthermore, none of the cohorts explored novelty at levels
signiﬁcantly different than expected by chance (i.e., 50%).
For each of the foregoing open arena tasks, exploration ratios
were normalized by the time spent at familiar locations and/or
objects by calculating the discrimination index (DI), and in each
case signiﬁcant preference for the novelty was again found for the
NPR and TO tasks with a trend in the OiP task (Supplementary

Table S1). While the overall tendency of CYP-treated cohorts
was to explore less during the TO and OiP phases, the reduced
exploration time was less likely to impact discrimination
between the novel and familiar object (Supplementary Table
S1). Since variations in overall exploration between the cohorts
may, however, confound the assignment of exploration ratio
data solely to cognitive deﬁcits, additional analyses including
locomotor activity and fear conditioning were conducted.
While no changes were found in locomotor activity during
habituation, CYP-treated cohorts did exhibit reduced locomotor activity compared with controls, an effect that was
completely reversed by stem cell transplantation in all cohorts
(Supplementary Data). Despite the beneﬁcial effects of stem
cell transplantation, these data prompted additional behavioral
testing using a contextual FC task that does not rely on spontaneous exploration.
Fear conditioning
Each phase of the FC task (training, cue and context tests) were
administered over 3 days. Group means and 95% CIs for post
training and context phase freezing (percent) were as follows:
post-training CON (mean ¼ 98.6; 95% CI, 96–100); CYP (mean
¼ 91.1; 95% CI, 87–95); CYPþhNSC (mean ¼ 81.9; 95% CI, 69–
94); context CON (mean ¼ 64.6; 95% CI, 52–78); CYP (mean ¼
30.1; 95% CI, 22–38); CYPþhNSC (mean ¼ 56.7; 95% CI, 44–
69). Using repeated measures ANOVA, a signiﬁcant overall group
 phase interaction effect was found for the percentage of time
spent freezing during the FC task (Fig. 1E; F(8,84) ¼ 12.54; P ¼
0.0001). Repeated measures two-way ANOVA for each phase
revealed signiﬁcant differences between CYP and Con groups in
posttraining (P ¼ 0.022) and context (P ¼ 0.002) phases; and
between CYP and CYPþhNSC groups in the context phase (P ¼
0.04). Groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in the freezing behavior
across baseline (P ¼ 0.25), pre-cue (P ¼ 0.17), and post-cue (P ¼
0.12) phases, indicating a selective deﬁcit on the hippocampaldependent contextual memory phase of the task. Transplanted
animals were found to spend less time freezing during the posttraining phase compared with controls (P ¼ 0.01). During the
context test phase, post hoc tests conﬁrmed that CYP animals spent
signiﬁcantly decreased percentages of time freezing compared
with CON (P ¼ 0.001) and CYPþhNSC (P ¼ 0.002) groups,
whereas CON and CYPþhNSC groups did not differ. Moreover,
because all groups showed signiﬁcant increases in freezing behavior after the tone-shock pairings (posttraining phase), CYP treatment did not impair sensory function. As cued memory was intact,
acquisition of the tone-shock pairing was not impaired, and the
deﬁcit was speciﬁc to the memory of the context in which the
pairing was learned.
Survival and differentiation of grafted human cells
Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of surviving grafted
human (HuN positive, green) cells in the hippocampus (Fig. 2A–
C). The differentiated fate of graft-derived cells was determined by
dual immunoﬂuorescence and confocal Z-stack analyses (three
representative sections/animal, n ¼ 4 animals) of the CYPþhNSC
cohort. Examination of dual immunoﬂuorescence-stained HuNþ
cells revealed the majority of grafted cells to coexpress the neural
stem cell marker (Fig. 2D, Sox2). Engrafted cells also differentiated along neuronal and astrocytic lineages. The analysis of
dual-labeled cells indicated that multiple immature and mature

neuronal, astrocytic and oligodendroglial phenotypes were present in the host hippocampus (Fig. 2D). Transplant-derived cells
were found to express immature and mature neuron (DCX and
NeuN), astrocyte (GFAP and S100bþ) and oligodendrocytes
(NG2 and Olig2) markers (Fig. 2D). Unbiased stereology used
to quantify the number of surviving grafted human cells revealed

following transplantation surgery (Fig. 2E).
Quantiﬁcation of differentiated phenotypes revealed that the

expressed Sox2 (11.9%  1.6%, N ¼ 4). Immature (DCX,
2.22%  0.51%; N ¼ 4) and mature (NeuN, 7.61%  0.25%;

 0.69%; N ¼ 4) oligodendrocytes were also found (Fig. 2F).
Collectively, these yields translated to 9.83  1.3% or 2,980  388
neurons and 8.20%  2.9% or 2,490  871 astroglia per hippocampus surviving 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 2G). Thus,
chemotherapy exposure did not impose any overt restrictions on
lineage-speciﬁc progression, as stem cells were able to graft and
differentiate within a permissive microenvironment.

Neuroinﬂammation
We reported previously that exposure to chemotherapy elevates
neuroinﬂammation (4), and to assess the impact of CYP and stem
cell treatments on the inﬂammatory status of the brain, microglia
were quantiﬁed throughout different regions of the hippocampus
(Fig. 3A–C). A signiﬁcant overall group effect was found for
differences in the number of activated microglia in the dentate
hilus (DH; F(2,9) ¼ 32.67, P ¼ 0.0001), the dentate gyrus (DG;
F(2,7) ¼ 6.343, P ¼ 0.0268) and the CA1/3 subﬁelds (F(2,8) ¼
22.46, P ¼ 0.0005). Compared with controls, CYP treatment
elevated the number of activated microglia (ED1þ cells) significantly in the DH and CA3/1 subﬁelds, an effect not found in the
DG (Fig. 3D). Stem cell grafting was found to reduce signiﬁcantly
the number of activated microglia in the DH, DG, and the CA3/1
subﬁelds (Fig. 3D). Data indicate that stem cell grafting signiﬁcantly reduced neuroinﬂammation in each of the hippocampal
subﬁelds analyzed.

neurons in the DG, Golgi–Cox impregnated sections were analyzed for changes in dendritic structure, spine density and morphology. Wide ﬁeld images of Golgi–Cox impregnated neurons in
the DG and CA1 hippocampal subﬁelds reveal the marked impact
of CYP treatment (Fig. 4A–C). Compared with controls (Fig. 4A),
neuronal complexity is severely compromised after exposure to
CYP (Fig. 4B) an adverse effect that is reversed by stem cell grafting
(Fig. 4C). Representative neuronal tracings from each cohort are
shown superimposed over concentric Sholl circles spaced 50 mm
apart (Fig. 4D). Dendritic tracing of granule cell neurons revealed
the adverse effects of chemotherapy and the beneﬁcial effects of
stem cell grafting on neuronal morphology. Signiﬁcant overall
group effects were found for dendritic length (F(2,9) ¼ 19.07; P ¼
0.0006), volume (F(2,9) ¼ 11.74; P ¼ 0.0031), and complexity
(F(2,0) ¼ 35.44; P ¼ 0.0001). Quantiﬁcation of dendritic parameters revealed that CYP cohorts exhibited signiﬁcant reductions
in overall dendritic length, volume and complexity compared
with the other cohorts (Fig. 4E). Signiﬁcant overall group effects
were also found for changes in dendritic endings (F(2,9) ¼ 17.82; P
¼ 0.0007), granule neuron cell body area (F(2,9) ¼ 6.491; P ¼
0.018) and soma perimeter (F(2,9) ¼ 40.18; P ¼ 0.0001). Compared with the other cohorts, CYP-treated animals exhibited
reduced dendritic endings and a marked swelling of the cell body
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, Sholl analyses showed
that CYP treatments reduced signiﬁcantly the number of distal

www.aacrjournals.org

dendritic endings and intersections (100–200 mm) from the soma
with smaller effects on the number of dendritic nodes (Supplementary Fig. S2B). For all the foregoing endpoints, sham-surgery
controls (CON) were statistically indistinguishable from those
animals receiving stem cell transplants (CYPþhNSC). Data show
that stem cell grafting preserved host dendritic structure following
chemotherapy.
Neuronal morphology in the CA1
Similar morphometric analyses were conducted in the CA1
subﬁeld to assess the impact of CYP and stem cell treatments on
pyramidal neurons. As before, overall dendritic arborization was
reduced signiﬁcantly in CYP-treated animals compared with other
cohorts, evident in the representative tracings of pyramidal cell
neurons (Fig. 5A). Further analysis of the basal dendritic tree
revealed signiﬁcant overall group effects for changes in the total
dendritic length (F(2,9) ¼ 24.73; P ¼ 0.0002), volume (F(2,9) ¼
50.89; P ¼ 0.0001), and complexity (F(2,9) ¼ 21.73; P ¼
0.0004; Fig. 5B). These data showed that CYP led to signiﬁcant
reductions in overall dendritic length, volume, and complexity
compared with the other cohorts (Fig. 5B). As in the DG, significant overall group effects were found for changes in basal
dendritic endings (F(2,9) ¼ 9.382; P ¼ 0.0063) and in pyramidal
neuron soma perimeter (F(2,9) ¼ 35.40; P ¼ 0.0001), where CYPtreated animals were found to have lower dendritic endings and

showed that CYP reduced signiﬁcantly the number of proximal
dendritic endings and intersections (50–200 mm) from the soma
with little impact on the number of dendritic nodes (Supplementary Fig. S3C) in the basal tree. For basal dendritic parameters,
sham-surgery controls (CON) were statistically indistinguishable
from those animals receiving stem cell transplants (CYPþhNSC).

treatments caused signiﬁcant reductions in total dendritic length,
volume, complexity (Fig. 5B), and endings (Supplementary Fig.
S3) compared with control and transplanted (CYPþhNSC)
cohorts. Stem cell grafting was again found to signiﬁcantly
increase each of these dendritic parameters compared with the
other cohorts (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S3). Sholl analyses
also revealed that CYP treatment led to marked and signiﬁcant
reductions in the number of dendritic endings, intersections, and
nodes over proximal distances (100–300 mm) from the soma
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Collectively, morphometric data indicate clearly that following chemotherapy stem cell transplantation had a signiﬁcant and beneﬁcial effect that involved the
enhanced arborization of the apical and basal dendritic trees of
CA1 pyramidal cells.

Dendritic spine analysis in the dentate gyrus and CA1
Analysis of dendritic spines along neurons within the DG
and CA1 subﬁelds again showed the signiﬁcant adverse effects
of CYP treatment when compared against untreated or stem
cell–grafted cohorts (Fig. 6). Representative images of selected
dendritic segments in the DG and CA1 (Fig. 6A and D) show
the stripping of synaptic spines caused by CYP treatments,
which was reversed by stem cell grafting. Stereologic quantiﬁcation of immature and mature spine morphologies along
granule and pyramidal cell neurons (Fig. 6B and E) show that
compared with the other cohorts, chemotherapy caused
marked and signiﬁcant reductions in all spine types. Signiﬁcant overall group effects were found for changes in the
number of long/thin (F(2,6) ¼ 8.301; P ¼ 0.0187) and mushroom (F(2,6) ¼ 40.25; P ¼ 0003) spine types in the DG, with a
trend (F(2,6) ¼ 4.969, P ¼ 0.0534) found for stubby spines
(Fig. 6B). Similarly, overall group effects were found for
altered numbers of long/thin (F(2,6) ¼ 12.04; P ¼ 0.0079),
mushroom (F(2,6) ¼ 14.84; P ¼ 0.0048), and stubby (F(2,6)
¼ 13.52; P ¼ 0.006) spine types in the CA1 (Fig. 6E). Importantly, reductions in the number of speciﬁc spine types after
CYP treatment translated to signiﬁcant overall group effects for
the number of total spines in the DG (F(2,6) ¼ 21.91; P ¼
0.0017) and CA1 (F(2,6) ¼ 16.70; P ¼ 0.0035) subﬁelds (Fig.
6C and F). Dendritic spine density in the DG and CA1 was
reduced signiﬁcantly in CYP-treated animals compared with
control and transplanted (CYPþhNSC) cohorts (Fig. 6C and
F). These data demonstrate that in addition to the preservation
of dendritic architecture, stem cell grafting increased immature
and mature spine numbers to enhance spine density after
chemotherapy.

Discussion
Adverse neurocognitive side effects associated with various
chemotherapy regimens have now been recognized clinically for
many years (25). Diverse and multifaceted decrements involving
memory, concentration, language, attention, and executive function have been described that impact multiple cognitive domains
that persist long after the cessation of chemotherapy (26). While
animal work conducted in the absence of confounding disease has
shed considerable light on many factors contributing to chemobrain, the mechanisms underlying this serious clinical disorder
remain incompletely understood. Thus, the current work sought
to identify potential neurobiologic mechanisms involved in chemobrain as well as to explore the use of stem cells as potential
therapeutic agents to reverse and/or protect against the neurocognitive sequelae associated with this condition.
Cognitive tasks were selected to speciﬁcally interrogate medial
prefrontal cortical function as well as hippocampal dependent
tasks. Chronic CYP treatment was shown to signiﬁcantly impair
behavioral performance on 3 of 4 cognitive tasks administered
(Fig. 1). Arena testing revealed signiﬁcant impairments on the
NPR and TO tasks with a similar trend found on the OIP task.
Permanent lesion studies have established the importance of the
perirhinal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in
TO and OIP recognition memory (27, 28). Performance on these
tasks also requires circuits from these three regions to interact (27,
28), suggesting that chronic CYP treatment disrupted neural
connectivity between hippocampal and cortical circuits. Exploration ratios (Fig. 1) and Supplementary Data shown as DIs show
a clear preference for the novel object (NPR and TO tasks), and the
similarity of time spent exploring either object on the NPR task

suggest these deﬁcits are likely the result of impaired hippocampal
learning and memory. For the TO and OiP tasks, the total time
exploring novel and familiar objects were found to exhibit some
variation, as the total exploration for the control group was
relatively high (and statistically different) compared with either
CYP or CYPþhNSC groups. While this may indicate that CYPtreated animals simply did not recognize that the arrangement of
objects/locations was different and so, did not possess the same
level of curiosity to explore a "new" environment, other factors
such as depression and/or anxiety may be associated with the
behavioral decrements on these tasks. Nonetheless, such effects
were still ameliorated by stem cell transplantation in all cohorts.
While the focus of this study was not to elucidate the sensitivity
of different brain regions to CYP, as treatments were systemic,
these data do corroborate certain clinical ﬁndings (29, 30), and
demonstrate that CYP treatments likely induced more global
insults to the brain not merely restricted to the hippocampus.
FC was conducted in part to ensure that reduced locomotor
activity was not differentially affecting exploration preference
between the cohorts. Data conﬁrmed that CYP treatment caused
a signiﬁcant impairment on the hippocampal-dependent contextual memory test, an effect that did not extend to cued memory
that has been shown to be more dependent on the amygdala (31).
Unbiased stereology used to quantify grafted cell survival
conﬁrmed that 8% of the transplanted cells were still present 2
months after surgery (Fig. 2). These data indicate that exposure to
chronic CYP did not preclude stem cell grafting or render the CNS
microenvironment refractory to the beneﬁcial effects of stem cell
transplantation. Cells surviving at this time were found to express
both immature and mature markers of neuronal and astroglial
lineages along with markers of multipotency (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that so few cells (i.e., 60,000/brain) were able to provide
such extensive neurocognitive beneﬁts, suggesting that transplanting fewer rather than greater numbers of stem cells may
provide equivalent (or superior) beneﬁcial effects. On the basis of
phenotype, morphology, location, distance from transplant core
and yield, the beneﬁcial CNS effects associated with stem cell
grafting appear more likely the result of trophic support, rather
than functional replacement. Finally, the impact of grafted cells
on host neurogenesis may also play a role in mediating certain
positive effects of stem cell grafting in the CYP-treated brain, and
while not a focus of this study, we cannot formally discount this
possibility.
To analyze further the potential mechanisms by which grafted
cells nurture and/or protect the host microenvironment, the
number of microglia were quantiﬁed to gauge relative levels of
neuroinﬂammation between cohorts and different regions of the
brain. With the exception of the DG, CYP treatment caused a
signiﬁcant (2-fold) rise in activated microglia compared with
controls (Fig. 3). For all cohorts, stem cell grafting reduced
signiﬁcantly, the number of activated microglia compared with
CYP-treated cohorts, and showed a trend toward reduced microglia compared to controls. Thus, the capability of grafted stem
cells to attenuate neuroinﬂammation provides one plausible
explanation for their beneﬁcial effects in the CYP-treated brain,
and likely involves the quenching of chemokine signaling in the
brain to dampen the recruitment and/or activation of resident
microglia (32, 33).
Suppression of neuroinﬂammation can have a variety of pleiotropic effects (34), where microglia have been found to regulate
synaptic plasticity by actively pruning neuronal circuits to main-

684 Cancer Res; 75(4) February 15, 2015

tain dendritic structure and synaptic function (35–37). In
response to chemotherapy, endogenous microglia may be activated to remodel damage circuits and synaptic connections,
resulting in reduced dendritic complexity and spine density. To
test this, neuronal architectural parameters were quantiﬁed within
the DG and CA1 subﬁelds and data revealed signiﬁcant reductions
in dendritic arborization and spine density (Figs. 4–6 and Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Overall, dendritic length, volume
and complexity were reduced signiﬁcantly by CYP treatments,
effects that were preserved at control levels in cohorts receiving
stem cell transplantation. Sholl analyses corroborated these
results, showing that granule and pyramidal cell neurons
from each region of CON and CYP-hNSC cohorts exhibited a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of dendritic endings and/or
intersections over proximal to distal distances from the soma
compared with CYP-treated cohorts. Collectively, data demonstrate that stem cell grafting either protected host neuronal
circuitry or promoted recovery following CYP treatment.
The beneﬁcial effect of stem cells extended to the ultrastructural
features of dendrites as reductions in spine density and critical
morphologies caused by CYP, were also resolved by stem cell
grafting. In the DG, exposure to CYP led to signiﬁcant reductions
in spine density and speciﬁc spine morphologies. In the CA1,
chronic CYP treatments caused signiﬁcant reductions in mushroom and stubby spine morphologies with a trend toward
reduced long/thin spines. These changes again translated to an
overall signiﬁcant reduction in spine density (Fig. 6). Interestingly, CYP treatment induced a signiﬁcant swelling of the cell body in
neurons of the DG and CA1 compared with the other cohorts. Past
work (38) has documented hypertrophy of the soma associated
with other neuropathologic conditions, and current ﬁndings
suggest that chemotherapy elicits a similar response. In each of
the foregoing instances, stem cell grafting promoted the recovery
of overall spine density and each of the CYP-depleted spine
morphologies. Thus, in addition to the improvements in dendritic
arborization, stem cell grafting had a signiﬁcant and beneﬁcial
impact on dendritic spines, where both immature (long/thin,
mushroom) as well as mature (stubby) morphologies depleted by
CYP treatments returned to levels at or higher than control levels
following stem cell grafting.
A wealth of past studies has established a clear link between a
variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and
disrupted neuronal morphology (20, 39, 40). Alterations to
dendritic arborization, synaptic integrity, spine density, and morphology have been found in all neurodegenerative diseases associated with deﬁcits in learning and memory (41–43). As evidence
indicates that compromised dendritic structure and synaptic
plasticity hastens the onset and severity of neurocognitive sequelae, it is not surprising that chemotherapy-associated cognitive
decline exhibits similar structural and functional parallels with
other conditions of cognitive dysfunction, especially when compared with other treatments (e.g., radiotherapy) used to control
the growth and spread of cancer (16, 17).
Our preclinical data shed considerable light on the causes and
potential treatments for chemobrain in two important ways. First,
chemotherapy-induced hippocampal and cortical behavioral deficits are directly associated with compromised neuronal architecture, depleted dendritic spines, and elevated yields of activated
microglia in the hippocampus. Second, the neuropathology associated with chemobrain can be reversed successfully via cranial
transplantation of hNSCs, leading to functional improvements in

behavior. Whether this effect was the consequence of suppressing
neuroinﬂammation and/or stimulating dendritic branching and
spinogenesis through secreted neurotrophic factors remains
uncertain, but our data demonstrate clearly that a wide range of
adverse effects associated with a chronic chemotherapy regimen
can be improved signiﬁcantly at the cellular, structural, and
functional levels by stem cell transplantation.
