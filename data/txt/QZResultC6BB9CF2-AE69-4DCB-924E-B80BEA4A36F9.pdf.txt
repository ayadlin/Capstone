ABSTRACT:
LINE-1 elements make up the most abundant retrotransposon family in the
human genome. Full-length LINE-1 elements encode a reverse transcriptase (RT)
activity required for their own retrotranpsosition as well as that of non-autonomous
Alu elements. LINE-1 are poorly expressed in normal cells and abundantly in cancer
cells. Decreasing RT activity in cancer cells, by either LINE-1-specific RNA interference,
or by RT inhibitory drugs, was previously found to reduce proliferation and promote
differentiation and to antagonize tumor growth in animal models. Here we have
investigated how RT exerts these global regulatory functions.
We report that the RT inhibitor efavirenz (EFV) selectively downregulates
proliferation of transformed cell lines, while exerting only mild effects on nontransformed cells; this differential sensitivity matches a differential RT abundance,
which is high in the former and undetectable in the latter. Using CsCl density gradients,
we selectively identify Alu and LINE-1 containing DNA:RNA hybrid molecules in cancer
but not in normal cells. Remarkably, hybrid molecules fail to form in tumor cells
treated with EFV under the same conditions that repress proliferation and induce
the reprogramming of expression profiles of coding genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and
ultraconserved regions (UCRs). The RT-sensitive miRNAs and UCRs are significantly
associated with Alu sequences.
The results suggest that LINE-1-encoded RT governs the balance between
single-stranded and double-stranded RNA production. In cancer cells the abundant
RT reverse-transcribes retroelement-derived mRNAs forming RNA:DNA hybrids. We
propose that this impairs the formation of double-stranded RNAs and the ensuing
production of small regulatory RNAs, with a direct impact on gene expression.
RT inhibition restores the ‘normal’ small RNA profile and the regulatory networks
that depend on them. Thus, the retrotransposon-encoded RT drives a previously
unrecognized mechanism crucial to the transformed state in tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

LINE- 1 elements and of the RT activity which they
encode, as well as LINE-1 copy number amplification in
early stages of breast cancer progression, suggesting that
LINE-1 activity can be regarded as an early cancer marker
[20].
Previous work in our laboratory showed that
LINE-1-encoded RT activity is crucial for control of
cell proliferation, differentiation and tumor progression
[reviewed in 21]. Indeed, RT downregulation via RNA
interference (RNAi) to active LINE-1 element was
associated with redifferentiation, decreased proliferation
and reduced tumorigenic potential of transformed cells
[22, 23]. RT inhibitors are powerful tools to probe RT
function. Efavirenz (EFV), a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor
originally designed to target the HIV-encoded RT, has a
demonstrated ability to inhibit the endogenous cellular
RT [24]; remarkably, EFV elicits the same cancer reversal
phenotypes [22, 23, 25] observed after RNAi silencing
of active LINE-1 elements [23, 26]. Similar effects were
reported in human cancer cell lines after treatment with
nevirapine, another non-nucleoside RT inhibitor [27]
or with the nucleosidic RT inhibitor abacavir [28 and
references herein]. Furthermore, EFV has anti-cancer
efficacy in vivo and antagonizes the development of
human tumors xenografted in nude mice [23]. These
results i) identify active LINE-1 retrotransposon families
as the major source of functional RT in transformed cells,
and ii) indicate that LINE-1-encoded RT might be regarded
as a novel target in cancer differentiation therapy. Phase
II trials are actually in progress to assess the therapeutic
efficacy of EFV on metastatic prostate carcinoma patients
(clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00964002?term=NCT00
964002&rank=1). In contrast with the empirical efficacy
of RT inhibitors, however, the molecular role of RT in
cancer genomes is still elusive.
Here we report that treatment of A-375 melanoma
cells with EFV causes a global reprogramming of the
transcriptome, involving both coding and non-coding
sequences with key roles in establishing cancer-repressive
or -permissive conditions. We describe an active role
of the endogenous RT in tumorigenesis, not only via
transposition-associated integration events, but also by
regulating the production of small non-coding regulatory
RNAs.

Evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed,
including in its non-coding component, is now an
established finding [1] and is changing our views of
global mechanisms of regulation of genome function [2].
It is emerging that non-protein coding sequences have
key roles in complex pathways regulating the genome
functional profile and are often dysregulated in cancer.
Mobile retroelements, including retrotransposons
and endogenous retroviruses, make up as much as 45%
of the human genome [3]. In contrast with traditional
views that considered them to be functionally inert,
parasitic burden of eukaryotic genomes, retroelements
are in fact extensively transcribed, harboring about 30%
of all human transcription start sites [4]. Alu and LINE-1
elements are the largest non-autonomous and autonomous
retrotransposon families, accounting for about 10% and
17% of the human genome, respectively [5]. Full-length
LINE-1 elements encode their own reverse transcriptase
(RT) enzyme, responsible for retrotranscription and,
hence, RNA-dependent mobilization of both LINE-1
elements themselves and of non-autonomous Alus. Both
families influence the transcriptional output of the genome
and growing studies highlight roles of both families in
tumorigenesis [6-8].
Alu and LINE-1 families display differentially
modulated patterns of expression [4 and references
therein]. Alus are stress-responsive elements transcribed
by Pol III and show upregulated expression in response
to various environmental stimuli (reviewed in 9). Aluderived RNA is exported to the cytoplasm and processed
into small cytoplasmic RNAs (scAlu RNAs) that target
matching Alu-containing mRNAs by specific base-pairing,
thus decreasing their stability [10,11]. Other proposed
mechanisms for Alu roles in gene regulation include
nuclear retention of Alu-embedded mRNAs, alternative
splicing and repression of translation into protein products
[9].
LINE-1 elements are transcribed by Pol II. They
provide a source of small RNAs derived from bidirectional
transcripts and endowed with regulatory functions [12].
They act as key players in embryonic development [13]
and as causative agents in numerous diseases, including
cancer [for a review see 14]. Indeed, LINE-1s are highly
expressed during embryogenesis [13] and in embryonic
stem cells [15], as other retroelement families, indicating
that early embryos represent a permissive environment
for both reverse transcription [16] and retrotransposition
[17]. In contrast, both LINE-1 transcript abundance and
retrotransposition are reduced in terminally differentiated
non-dividing cells [18]. Retroelements are however highly
active in cancer cells and tissues [for a review see 6]. In
recent work using a well characterized mouse model of
breast cancer progression, i.e. the MMTV murine strain
[19 ], we have been able to pinpoint overexpression of

RESULTS
RT-expressing cancer cell lines but not RTdeprived normal cells are sensitive to the RT
inhibitor EFV
In past work we found in time-course assays that
exposure of cancer cell lines to RT inhibitors reduced
proliferation and promoted differentiation (substantiated

by morphological and molecular changes) after 4-5 days
of treatment [22; 23]; prolonged treatment maintained
these features, whereas the cells quickly returned to their
original conditions upon discontinuation of the treatment
[23]. Prior to addressing the molecular mechanisms
through which RT inhibitors regulate these changes, we
first comparatively assayed the effect of RT-inhibitory
treatment in human cancer cell lines of unrelated
origin, i.e. A-375 melanoma, PC3 prostate carcinoma,
U87 glioblastoma and Saos-2 osteosarcoma and, for
comparison, in human non-transformed WI38 fibroblast
cells, testing increasing concentrations of EFV.
The results summarized in Fig.1A show that low
concentrations of EFV (10-20 uM) reduced the rate of
proliferation of all four tumor cell lines by about 50%
after 96 hours and higher concentrations (40-50 uM)
fully abrogated it; in contrast, proliferation of normal
WI38 was not, or only mildly, affected even with the
highest concentration. These results confirm that the
antiproliferative effects of EFV can be appreciated as
early as 4 days after onset of the treatment in a variety of
unrelated cancer-derived cell types, while undescoring a
markedly reduced sensitivity of non cancer cells. It was
relevant to assess the RT protein levels in the examined
cell lines. LINE-1-encoded RT derives from the LINE-1
ORF2 product (ORF2p), a single 150 kDa polypeptide
containing endonuclease (EN), reverse transcriptase (RT)
and cysteine-rich (CYS) domains. We used a specific
antibody directed against the LINE-1-encoded ORF2p in
Western blot analysis of total proteins extracted from the

cell lines analyzed in Fig. 1A. Results in Fig. 1B show
that LINE-1-derived ORF2p, encoding the RT activity,
is expressed in all cancer cell lines (most abundantly in
Saos-2 cells) while being undetectable in normal WI38
fibroblasts. Together these results provide further support
to the notion that the LINE-1-encoded RT is highly
expressed in cancer but not in normal cells and confirm
the selective sensitivity of cancer cells to RT inhibition
by EFV.

Alu- and LINE-1-containing hybrid RNA:DNA
structures are present in transformed cells and
are abrogated upon RT inhibitory treatment
LINE-1-encoded RT catalyzes the reverse
transcription of both LINE-1 and Alu RNAs as a key
step in the process of retrotransposition [29]. Both
retrotransposon families act as sources of regulatory
double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs) [30]. We wondered
whether RT inhibition by EFV affected the production
of dsRNAs in tumor cells. As newly reverse-transcribed
cDNA copies would be virtually undistinguishable from
the original DNA templates, we focused on the production
of intermediate RNA:DNA hybrid products as a read-out
of RT activity: we reasoned that such hybrid molecules
might form preferentially in tumor cells, where LINE-1
encoded RT activity is higher compared to normal cells
[21 and Fig. 1B]. If so, the formation of hybrid molecules
might hinder the production of regulatory dsRNAs in
cancer cells, but RT inhibitors should restore it. Such
hybrids might also represent novel molecular markers in
cancer cells.
To address this issue, we compared DNA
preparations from untreated A-375 melanoma, PC3
prostate carcinoma, non-transformed WI38 human
fibroblasts and EFV-treated A-375 cells in EtBr-containing
CsCl buoyant density centrifugation assays [31]. Linear
and closed circular plasmid DNA, 3H-end labelled poly
dA:U (DNA:RNA hybrid) and 3H-end labeled polyU
(RNA) were used as density markers (Figure 2A).
Gradient fractions were then analyzed by direct PCR
amplification using LINE-1 ORF2- and Alu-specific
oligonucleotide pairs.
LINE-1-containing sequences were identified in
fractions 6 to 12, peaking in fraction 8, in samples from
all cell types (Figure 2B): this corresponds to the density
of linear DNA marker and indicates that the DNA bulk
from all cell samples have comparable buoyant density.
An additional LINE-1 amplification product was also
identified in gradient regions of higher density, peaking
at fraction 21 (starred in Figure 2B), which overlaps the
buoyant density of the RNA:DNA hybrid marker. Hybrids
were detected in native A-375 and PC3 tumor cell lines,
but neither in non-transformed WI38 fibroblasts nor in
EFV-treated A-375 cells.

DNA amplification products peaking in fraction 8 in all
four samples, and in fraction 21 only in A-375 and PC3

PCR using both LINE-1 and Alu oligonucleotide pairs.
Indeed, DNAse I digestion abrogated both LINE-1- and
Alu- amplification products from fraction 8, while not
affecting the amplification products from fraction 21
(Figure 2D); the latter were abrogated after RNAse H and
DNAse I double digestion. For further characterization,
samples from fractions 8 and 21 were P32–labeled by
random priming and fractionated on 1,7 % agarose gel

to determine their size (Fig.2Ea): fraction 8 showed
two labeled components, one of high molecular weight,
corresponding to bulk DNA and another one of smaller
size ranging from 500 to 100 bp. Both components
contain normal DNA because they are fully degraded upon
digestion with DNAse I alone. As expected, fraction 21
(Fig. 2Eb) lacks the high molecular weight component;
the labeled material is distributed in a smearing pattern

DNAse I/RNase H digestion. This again confirms that
fraction 21 mostly contains DNA:RNA hybrid molecules,

cells are pretreated with EFV (Fig. 2Ec). These results

non transformed cells and are abrogated in transformed
cells treated with RT inhibitor.

RT governs these phenomena, we decided to carry out a

RNA transcription. A-375 melanoma cells were treated

and methods) focusing on: i) protein-coding genes, ii)
miRNAs and iii) ultraconserved regions (UCRs), a class
of genomic sequences frequently located at chromosomal
fragile sites and originating a subset of non-coding RNAs
whose expression is altered in human cancers [32-34].
The results indicate an extensive reprogramming of
transcription profiles for all three classes of sequences
in EFV-treated compared to untreated A-375 cells. 854
coding genes were found to be modulated by EFV, 456
of which were down- and 398 upregulated (full list in

growth (e.g., MYCN and BMX, both overexpressed in a
variety of tumors); conversely, the upregulated group
includes genes with growth suppressive activity, e.g.
ANGPTL4 (prevents metastatic progression by inhibiting
vascular activity, tumor cell motility and invasiveness),
RASAL1 (suppresses cell proliferation and transformation
ability of gastric cancer cells) and Rap1GAP (a negative
regulator of cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness).
The Gene Ontology classification of EFV-modulated genes
(Figure 3A), analyzed using the Fisher Modified Exact
(p-value ≤0.01), revealed that EFV-downregulated genes
are enriched in the classes of growth factor binding, cell
proliferation, signal transduction cell motion and response
to steroid hormones, while upregulated genes show,
among others, a significant enrichment in genes related to

the immune response, pathways of cell differentiation and
growth factor activity.
We next examined miRNA expression profiles in
control and EFV-treated A-375 cells, and found that 35 out
of 726 analyzed miRNAs showed significant variations
after EFV treatment (list in supplementary Table S3;
T test corrected p-value < 0.05, fold change ≥1.5); of
those, 19 were down- and 16 upregulated. The functional
annotation analysis of the resulting miRNA list, performed
using the TAM online tool, depicted a significant
enrichment (p-value <0.05) in cell proliferation-, tumor
chemosensitivity-, chromatin remodeling-, apoptosis-, cell
death and tumor suppression-associated miRNAs (Figure
3B). The same analysis conducted to detect any possible
overrepresented miRNA clusters showed that about one
third of the downregulated miRNAs belong to the hsamir-1283 cluster (data not shown), a primate-specific gene

cluster [35].
We noticed that most EFV-modulated miRNAs are
directed towards oncogenes or tumor suppressors and
typically localize close to or at cancer-associated genomic
regions (CAGRs) and fragile sites (Table 1). Remarkably,
ten EFV-modulated miRNAs classify as metastamiRs
(Table 2), a miRNA subpopulation with crucial roles
in tumor progression, invasiveness and metastasis
[reviewed in 34]. EFV treatment reversed their original
expression profiles in A-375 melanoma cells (Table 2) and
specifically upregulated those that are underexpressed in
cancer while downregulating the overexpressed ones, with
the exception of miR-125b, which can be either under- or
over-expressed in different tumors [37].
We also examined UCRs (481 sequences) [38] and
found that EFV significantly modifies the expression of
52 of them (p-value < 0.05, list in supplementary Table
S3, features are illustrated in Table 3). An analysis of
the genomic organization of EFV-modulated UCRs
revealed that 25 are upregulated and comprise mostly
(52%) non-exonic (N) elements, followed by 40% of
possibly exonic (P) and only 8% of exonic (E) elements.
In contrast, among 27 down-regulated UCRs, 78%
are exonic, whereas non-exonic and possibly exonic
elements account for only 15 and 7%, respectively. As in
the case of miRNAs, a large proportion of both up- and
downregulated elements are involved in human cancers
and/or structurally associated with loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) and fragile sites (Table 3). In synthesis, therefore,
the RT inhibitory treatment causes global changes in the
transcriptome of melanoma cells, affecting both coding
and non-coding sequences, many of which are involved in
cancer onset and progression.

The finding that exposure to EFV modulates the

these sequences might be physically associated to
retrotransposons. To address this question we analyzed
the EFV-modulated sequences using the RepeatMasker

these classes (details in Materials and Methods). EFVinsensitive members from the same class were used as

in tandem and inverted repeats (i.e. closely spaced elements with opposite orientation). The top left panel depicts four Alu elements in
opposite orientation on complementary DNA strands. Below, RNA transcripts (sense, red; antisense, green) containing two Alu retroelements
in opposite orientation can be generated either by the internal Alu promoters, or from one Alu promoter and a nearby gene promoter in
antisense orientation (external black arrows) provided by the host genome. LINE-1 elements (right) are endowed with sense (SP) and
antisense (ASP) promoters, supporting LINE-1 sense and antisense transcription. B) In normal cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) forms
either via intramolecular base paring of an RNA containing two oppositely orientated retroelements, or via base pairing between sense (S)
RNA and antisense (AS) RNAs. dsRNAs are processed by Dicer into small regulatory RNAs. C) In cancer cells, the RT encoded by highly
active LINE-1 elements reverse-transcribes the available RNA populations: RNA:cDNA hybrid molecules form efficiently (Figure 3B) to
the detriment of dsRNA. D) EFV treatment of cancer cells inhibits the RT activity, reduces the formation of RNA:cDNA hybrid and restores
the control of regulatory small RNAs, causing the epigenetic conversion to a normal phenotype.

A
proposed
model
for
RT-mediated
reprogramming of cancer transcriptome
The present findings suggest a model for the role
of LINE-1-encoded RT in the transition from normal to
tumorigenic transcriptome (Figure 6). The model builds
on the evidence that, in normal cells, LINE-1 and Alu
retrotransposons can generate dsRNAs [30] through
several pathways: intramolecular base paring of mRNAs
containing two oppositely oriented retroelements [9,39],
or base pairing between sense (S) RNA and antisense (AS)
transcripts - the latter originating from antisense promoters
occasionally provided by the host genome at nearby loci
[40] - or, for full-length LINE-1 elements, via transcription
from sense (SP) and antisense (ASP) promoters located
in their 5’-UTRs [12] (Fig. 6A). Retroelement-derived
dsRNAs are cleaved by Dicer into small RNAs that
have roles in regulation of the transcriptome [41] and in
heterochromatin organization [42] (Fig. 6B).
LINE-1 are overexpressed in cancer cells and RT
activity is correspondingly high [reviewed in 6; also
Fig. 1 in this paper]. In these cells, the abundant RT can
intercept and reverse-transcribe Alu and LINE-1 RNA
molecules (Fig. 6C), as indicated here by the presence
of DNA:RNA hybrids exclusively in cancer cells (Fig.
2). Such hybrid molecules have a potential to impair the
formation of dsRNAs. We find that DNA:RNA hybrid
structures do not form in EFV-treated melanoma cells
(Fig. 2B, C, Ea), suggesting that the RT inhibitor has
indeed removed a major hurdle in the biosynthesis of
Alu-derived small RNAs, thereby reestablishing the
physiological supply of regulatory small RNAs typical of
cancer-restrictive conditions. In other words, the model in
Fig. 6 highlights a previously unrecognized role of LINE1-encoded RT in disrupting miRNA-based regulatory
mechanisms operating in normal cells. Retrotransposonderived DNA:RNA hybrid molecules are found in cancer
cells of unrelated origin, suggesting that they are a
common feature in different cancer types. Interestingly,
we have identified discrete amounts of DNA:RNA hybrid
molecules in colon adenocarcinoma bioptic samples; only
faint traces were present in the neighboring colon tissue
from the same patient, deriving perhaps from infiltrating
cancer cells in the non-transformed tissue surrounding the
tumor (unpublished results). These data, to be extended in
further studies, confirm that RNA:DNA hybrids form in
primary cancer tissues.
The distinctive presence of the hybrid molecules in
cancer cells is consistent with the general observation that
both LINE-1-derived siRNA [43] and miRNAs [44] are
globally downregulated in tumor compared with normal
cells. Here we have used A375 melanoma cell cultures
to explore in depth the significance of the DNA:RNA

Closer inspection of EFV downregulated miRNA
and UCR populations revealed that a large proportion of
their Alu content is made up of pairs of typical inverted
Alu repeats (IRAlu), in which Alu elements are arranged
in opposite orientations (Figure 5A). We annotated
IRAlus in which the two sense/antisense arranged Alu
elements were separated by less than 2.000 base pairs
(Figure 5A). For both miRNAs (Figure 5B) and UCRs
(Figure 5C), IRAlu were strikingly more abundant among
EFV-downregulated compared to upregulated or nonmodulated sequence groups. In contrast, IRAlus were not
significantly enriched among EFV-downregulated proteincoding genes (Figure 5D), in which IRAlus were similarly
distributed among all subgroups.
The enrichment among EFV-downregulated
miRNAs and UCRs was confirmed when considering
only homologous IRAlus (red histograms in Figure 5), in
which both Alu repeats belong to the same subfamily; this
is interesting, as 82% of all homologous IRAlus belong to
AluS elements, one of the most ancient Alu subfamilies.
IRAlus constitute 87.4% of all Alu sequences found in
the vicinity of EFV-downregulated miRNAs, compared
to only 72% of Alus near non-modulated or upregulated
sequences (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Here we have combined microarray profiling,
genomic bioinformatics analysis and nucleic acid analysis
from density gradient fractions to investigate the molecular
mechanisms through which the cellular endogenous RT,
the major source of which is in active LINE-1 transposable
elements, and required for retrotransposition of LINE1 themselves and of non-autonomous Alu elements,
influences cancer cell proliferation. We report that:
i) exposure to the RT inhibitor EFV strongly inhibits
proliferation of RT actively expressing cancer cell lines,
while minimally affecting non transformed RT-deprived
cells; ii) RNA:DNA hybrid structures, containing both
Alu and LINE-1 sequences, are present in transformed
but not in normal cells; iii) EFV treatment of transformed
cells abrogates the formation of RNA:DNA hybrid
structures; concomitantly, iv) EFV treatment modulates
the expression of cancer-relevant miRNAs and coding
genes in a genome-wide analysis of melanoma cells; v)
EFV-downregulated sub-populations of miRNAs are
significantly enriched in Alus, and particularly in pairs
of inverted Alu repeats, IRAlu. These findings point to
a central role of RT, as detailed in the model explained

hybrids. We find that EFV-mediated RT inhibition,
parallel to preventing the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids
in A375 cells, induces an extensive remodulation of the
global transcriptome, an ultimate determinant of the cell
fate (supplementary Tables S1, S2, S3), involving coding
genes, miRNAs and UCRs implicated in proliferation,
signaling and growth fractor pathways. We propose
that RT inhibition suppresses the “cancer-promoting”
conditions that had lead to defective differentiation (or
dedifferentiation) and active proliferation, and restores a
“cancer-repressive” state.

as the basis for the establishment of “large-scale
regulatory networks across the transcriptome” [50]. The
RT-dependent mechanism in Fig. 6 presents a distinct yet
conceptually compatible scenario, in that the non-coding
component of the genome emerges as key not only to
shaping the global transcriptome, but also to balancing the
output of productive miRNAs through regulatory crosstalks.
In preliminary assays, we have found that EFV
modulates epigenetic marks and promotes a global
reorganization of nuclear chromatin, with a significant
increase in both heterochromatic foci and in histone
H3 K9 methylation (data not shown). These findings
highlight the nature of the LINE-1-encoded RT as an
epigenetic regulator and is consistent, in retrospect, with
earlier findings that RT repression (via RT inhibitors) and
reactivation (following discontinuation of the inhibitory
treatment) reversibly shift the cell status from normal to
tumorigenic [22, 23, 26]. This conclusion is in agreeement
with the view that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are
not necessarily separate events in oncogenesis [51].
A tempting parallel emerges between the
impairment, or partial inactivation, of small RNAdependent regulatory mechanisms associated with high
levels of LINE-1-encoded RT observed in cancer cells
and the global suppression of miRNA function occurring
during mouse preimplantation development [53], in stages
in which the RT-dependent mechanism is also highly
active [53,16]. This analogy suggests that the loss of small
RNA function is a general consequence of the activation of
the RT-dependent mechanism, a feature observed in both
tumor cells and embryos.

The link between retrotransposons and small
RNAs: functional implications
The RT-dependent mechanism described here,
and its origin in active LINE-1 elements, strengthen the
emerging links between the retrotransposon machinery
and small RNA-based regulatory mechanism(s) [35, 39,
45]. A high proportion of small RNAs originated and
evolved from retrotransposon families [39], e.g. MIR/
LINE-2 [45, 46], Alu [47, 35, 39, 9], LINE-1 [12, 44, 39]
and LTR-containing [44, 39]. Alu-specific dsRNAs are
generated in normal cells via intramolecular base paring of
mRNA containing two oppositely oriented retroelements.
The present data indicate that LINE-1-encoded RT can
disrupt small RNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, a
well-documented occurrence in cancer [48]. Our finding
that EFV preferentially downregulates sequences enriched
in Alus and IRAlus is also consistent with this idea.
The model in Fig. 6 proposes a key role for the
endogenous RT, and hence for LINE-1 and Alu repetitive
elements that depend on it, on the global production of
miRNAs, as part of a functional network that ultimately
targets the expression of protein-coding genes. The
network has a genome-wide reach, including ncRNAcoding sequences such as UCRs which, consistently,
are also modulated upon RT inhibition (Table 3,
supplementary Table S3). UCR expression is regulated by
direct interaction with miRNA [32,34]: while accounting
for their sensitivity to RT inhibition as observed in our
experiments, this would place UCRs downstream of
the RT-dependent regulatory circuit identified here. The
proposed model can also accommodate a role for long
ncRNAs, which are increasingly being identified as key
epigenetic players in various regulatory activities, two
thirds of which contain retroelement sequences [49 and
references herein].
Pseudogene-derived RNA transcripts have been
recently hypothesized to serve as “perfect decoys”
for absorbing specific miRNAs that otherwise affect
the expression of the ancestral protein-coding genes.
This hypothesis, referred to as the ceRNA hypothesis
(competing endogenous RNA), views the cross-talk
between reverse-transcribed cDNA copies and miRNAs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CONCLUSIONS
The present results extend previous findings that
LINE-1 elements, and their RT product, are expressed at
low levels in normal cells and abundantly in transformed
cells, and that RT inhibitory treatments restore
differentiation and reduce cell proliferation in transformed
cells. Moving one step further, the experiments reported
here identify an unsuspected role of RT in regulating the
production of small RNAs implicated in these events. In
normal cells, small regulatory RNAs are generated from
retroelements, a well-estabished source of double-stranded
RNA (dsRNAs) production. Our present findings indicate
that, in transformed cells, the endogenous RT reversetranscribes retroelement-derived transcripts and generates
DNA:RNA hybrid structures. We propose that this impairs
the production of dsRNAs that constitute the normal
substrate for Dicer cleavage, altering the formation of
regulatory small RNAs, with a direct impact on the global
transcriptome. RT inhibition restores the small RNAmediated mechanism of cellular control. These results
disclose a novel LINE-1 RT-dependent mechanism that
exerts a crucial role on proliferation and differentiation

METHODS
Cell culture and RT inhibition

Microarray analysis

Cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator. The human cancer-derived cell lines
A-375 (melanoma), U87 (glioblastoma), Saos-2
(osteosarcoma) were cultured in DMEM; the PC3
(prostate carcinoma) cell line was cultured in RPMI
1640. The non transformed WI38 human fibroblast cell
line (ATCC-CCL75) was cultured in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium supplemented with 1% non essential
aminoacids. All media were supplemented with 10%
FBS, 1% L-Glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
In proliferation assays 5x104 cells per well were seeded
in mutiwell culture dishes. EFV was purified from
commercially available Sustiva (Bristol-Myers Squibb)
as described [22], dissolved in DMSO and added to the
culture medium in the indicated concentrations and times.

Microarray results were analyzed by using the
GeneSpring GX 12.5 software (Agilent Technologies).
Data transformation was applied to set all the negative
raw values at 1.0, followed by a Quantile normalization
and a log2 transformation. Filters on gene expression were
used to keep only the miRNAs expressed (Detected) in
at least one sample. Differentially expressed miRNAs
were identified by comparing EFV vs. CTR samples. A
1.5 fold-change filter (for microRNAs and UCRs) or a
2 fold-change filter (for gene expression) followed by a
moderated t-test, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction,
were applied. The raw and normalized microarray data are
submitted to ArrayExpress database and can be retreived
using the following accession numbers: E-MTAB-1737
(microRNA), E-MTAB-1735 (gene expression),
E-MTAB-1736 (UCR expression). Gene annotations
were mined using web-based tools (DAVID, http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov, GeneCards, http://www.genecards.org/
index.shtml). A modified Fisher Exact test was used for
gene-enrichment analysis on Gene Ontology classification
(by DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) using the
composition of the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray
(V2) as a background. Gene ontology classification of
modulated miRNAs was performed using the TAM tool
for annotations of human miRNAs (http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.
cn/tam).

RNA extraction and array profiling of proteincoding genes, microRNAs and UCRs
For gene microarray and miRNA/UCR microarray
analyses, RNA was extracted from A-375 cells treated
for 12 days with 20 uM EFV or DMSO alone (controls,
CTR) using the PureLINK RNA mini kit (Ambion)
(gene microarrays) or Trizol (Ambion) (miRNA/UCR
microarray). Three biological replicates were used for
each microarray analysis.

NP-40, 0.25% (w/v) deoxycholic acid) and 1x complete
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals). 60 µg of total proteins were fractionated
through a 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel
(BIORAD 456-10237) and transferred using a TransBlot Turbo Transfer System (BIORAD 170-4155) on a
nitrocellulose membrane (Mini Nitrocellulose Transfer
Packs, (BIORAD 170-4158). Primary antibodies used
were LINE1 (H-110, raised against amino acids 10811190, mapping near the C-terminus of human LINE-1
protein product) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG

miRNA expression was investigated using the
Agilent Human miRNA microarray v.2 (#G4470B,
Agilent Technologies), as detailed in [54]. Proteincoding gene expression was detected using the Agilent
whole human genome oligo microarray (#G2509F,
Agilent Technologies). Labeled cRNA was synthesized
from 500 ng of total RNA using the Low Imput QuickAmp Labeling Kit, one color (Agilent Technologies) in
the presence of cyanine 3-CTP. Hybridizations were
performed at 65°C for 17 h in a rotating oven. Images
(5 um resolution) were generated by Agilent scanner
and the Feature Extraction 10.7.3.1 software (Agilent
Technologies) was used to obtain the microarray raw data.

Open-3.0 1996-2010, www.repeatmasker.org], we first
annotated from the human Reference sequence all REs
flanking (+/- 100 Kbp) each individual sequence of the
three analyzed classes (see supplementary Tables S5, S6,
S7). Gene-related elements were computed as “element
density”, i.e. element number divided by gene length,
then multiplied by 100.000; this procedure enabled a
direct comparison of the retroelement number among
genes of different length. We then compared the number
of retroelements from each family in EFV-modulated
genes, miRNAs and UCRs (modulated group) with
matched non-modulated members of the same classes
(see supplementary Figure S2 and Figure 4). Statistical
analyses were carried out using STATA. The RE content
was marked for each member of the analyzed classes
(genes, miRNAs, UCRs); a one-way ANOVA test was
then performed for each RE family between the modulated
and non-modulated group.

EtBr-CsCl buoyant density gradients and analysis
of gradient fractions
Genomic DNA was extracted from WI38, PC3
and A-375 cell lines in lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl
pH 7, 2 mM EDTA pH 8, 1% SDS) supplemented with
50 ug/ml Proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich) and 145 ug/ml
RNAse A (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37°C, followed
by several phenol/chlorophorm extractions. Solid CsCl
was added to a final concentration of 1.01 g/ml to 4 ml
aliquots containing 20 ug DNA and 200 ug/ml of ethidium
bromide [29] in polyallomer tubes (Beckman 342412) and
centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 24 h at room temperature
in a VTi65 rotor in a Thermo Scientific WX Ultra 100
ultracentrifuge. 27 fractions (190 ul each) were collected,
starting from the top, and their density was assessed in
a refractometer. DNA was ethanol-precipitated from each
fraction, washed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in 300
ul H2O and 5 ul aliquots from each fraction were PCR
amplified using the indicated oligonucleotide pairs:
ORF2: Fw- TCCAGCAGCACATCAAAAAG; RevCCAGTTTTTGCCCATTCAGT
Alu115: Fw- CCTGAGGTCAGGAGTTCGAG;
Rev- CCCGAGTAGCTGGGATTACA
GAPDH: Fw- GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT;
Rev- TGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAGG
Where indicated, fractions 8 and 21 collected from
the gradient were digested with either DNAse I alone, or
simultaneously with RNAseH/DNAse I and subjected
to PCR amplification. Circular and Bam H1-linearized
pCMV-EGFP plasmid DNA (Clontech) were used as
DNA density markers while [3H] end-labelled polyU
(100 nt) and [3H] end-labelled poly dA:U were RNA and
DNA:RNA hybrid density markers, respectively; densities
of these latters were determined by mixing aliquots of
gradient fractions with scintillation cocktail (Pico-Fluor
40, Perkin Elmer) and counting in a Beckman scintillation
counter. To determine the product sizes, fractions 8 (bulk)
and 21 (hybrid) from control and EFV-treated A375
cells were digested with DNAse I or RNAse H/ DNAse
I, labelled with alpha-32P dCTP using the Invitrogen
Random Primers DNA Labeling System kit (18187-013)
and fractionated through 1.7% agarose gels; the gels were
then dried and exposed to autoradiographic films.

Real-time PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed using a 7300 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR®
Green JumpStart™ Taq ReadyMix™ (Sigma-Aldrich
Co). 50 ng of cDNA from EFV-treated and control
(DMSO-treated) (4 days) A-375 cells were used. The
relative amounts of transcript were analyzed for serpin-1,
tachykinin (precursor 1), sox-11 and hmox1 genes using
the 2-DDCt method [55] and normalized to beta-actin.
