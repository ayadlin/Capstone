RING ﬁnger protein 31 promotes p53 degradation in breast
cancer cells

The atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 is highly expressed in human breast cancer, the most frequent neoplastic lethality among
women. Here, RNF31 depletion in breast cancer cells in combination with global gene expression proﬁling revealed p53 (TP53)
signaling as a potential RNF31 target. Interestingly, RNF31 decreased p53 stability, whereas depletion of RNF31 in breast cancer
cells caused cell cycle arrest and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, RNF31 associated with the
p53/MDM2 complex and facilitated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation by stabilizing MDM2, suggesting a molecular
mechanism by which RNF31 regulates cell death. Analysis of publically available clinical data sets displayed a negative correlation
between RNF31 and p53 target genes, including IGFBP3 and BTG1, consistent with RNF31 regulating p53 function in vivo as well.
Together, our ﬁndings suggest RNF31 as a potential therapeutic target to restore p53 function in breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide
and the most frequent neoplastic lethality among women.1
Chemotherapy is frequently used in patients resistant to endocrine therapy and in patients presenting with cancer that is
negative for the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs), progesterone receptors and HER2, the so-called triple-negative breast
cancer. A particular challenge is breast cancer resistance to
chemotherapy causing refractory disease.2 Thus, it is important to
further characterize signaling pathways in breast cancer with the
ultimate goal to identify novel therapeutic strategies.
The atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 (alias HOIP and ZIBRA),
belonging to the RING-between ring-RING (RBR) protein family of
E3 ubiquitin ligases,3 was initially cloned from breast cancer cells
based on its elevated mRNA expression.4 We previously showed
that RNF31 mRNA expression is higher in human breast cancer
compared with that in adjacent tissues.5
The tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53), discovered 30 years
ago,6 induces genes promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
including CDKN1A, BTG2 and BAX.7 The induced proteins can
either inhibit cell cycle progression by prohibiting cyclindependent kinases or promote apoptosis via the mitochondria
pathway.8 Mutant p53 is frequently observed in cancer and is
often associated with a loss of function to induce cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis.9 The frequency of p53 mutations in breast
cancer is ~ 20%.10,11
The p53-mediated pathways are activated by genotoxic
compounds, such as the chemotherapeutic compound cisplatin,
causing cell cycle arrest and cell death. If p53 is absent or mutated,
the execution of apoptosis is drastically reduced. Consistent with
this, the p53 status is a response marker to chemotherapy.12
Activation of p53 function is also being explored as a therapeutic
target in cancers.13,14

The p53 protein is the substrate of several E3 ubiquitin ligases,
including MDM2, p300 (EP300), COP1 and CHIP.15–18 MDM2 is
considered the major regulator of p53 and, on interaction, MDM2
induces p53 polyubiquitination and degradation.15 Furthermore,
as a short-lived protein, the MDM2 protein level is tightly
controlled. A number of E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate the
MDM2/p53 axis by stabilizing the MDM2 protein, rather than
directly modifying p53 stability.19,20
Using an unbiased approach of global gene expression proﬁling
after RNF31 depletion, we reveal RNF31 as a novel regulator of the
MDM2/p53 complex in breast cancer cells. We show that RNF31 by
stabilizing MDM2 promotes p53 degradation, leading to suppression of p53 target genes, ultimately facilitating breast cancer cell
proliferation and inhibition of cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
With this effect on a critical regulator, RNF31 should be
explored as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.
RESULTS
RNF31 depletion increases the expression of p53 target genes in
breast cancer cells
To approach the function of RNF31 in breast cancer cells in an
unbiased way, we analyzed changes in previously generated
global gene expression proﬁles following RNF31 depletion in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells.5 Interestingly, pathway analysis
revealed that RNF31 depletion is associated with changes in
speciﬁc signaling pathways, including p53 signaling (Figure 1a). By
overlapping published proﬁles of p53 target genes in MCF-7
cells21 with our derived gene expression proﬁles after RNF31
depletion in the same cell line, 62 genes that are subject to
regulation by both p53 and RNF31 were identiﬁed, supporting
common signaling pathways for RNF31 and p53 (Supplementary
Table S2). Figure 1b shows that the majority (68%) of these genes
were oppositely regulated by RNF31 and p53, suggesting that

Figure 1. RNF31 depletion increases the expression of p53 target genes in breast cancer cells. (a) Schematic graph illustrates signiﬁcantly
changed signaling by RNF31 depletion in MCF-7 cells. Signal pathway-enrichment analysis was used to derive the related pathways, using
Po0.001 and fold change42 as cutoff to derive regulated genes and Po 0.001 to deﬁne signiﬁcantly enriched pathways using Pathway
Studio (Elsevier). (b) Pie graph shows the relative fractions of genes regulated by p53 and RNF31 depletion. p53-activated/RNF31-suppressed
genes together with p53-suppressed/RNF31-activated genes account for 68% of the total genes. (c) The heatmap graph shows the
p53-activated/RNF31-suppressed genes in MCF-7 cells. (d) The heatmap graph shows that p53-activated genes are negatively correlated with
RNF31 expression in clinical breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

RNF31 inhibits p53 signaling (Figure 1b; blue segments). Among
these genes, 30 genes are p53 positively regulated genes that also
display increased expression by RNF31 depletion (Figure 1c).
Analysis of data in The Cancer Genome Atlas clinical sample
database shows that 15 out of these 30 p53-activated genes (50%)
are negatively and signiﬁcantly correlated with RNF31 expression,
thus supporting RNF31 inhibition of p53 signaling in vivo
(Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 1d).
RNF31 depletion induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in a p53-dependent manner
Consistent with the observation that RNF31 depletion induces p53
signaling in MCF-7 cells, RNF31 depletion induced p53 levels in
this cell line (Figure 2a). To investigate the role of RNF31 in cell
proliferation, in particular in relation to p53 signaling, we depleted
RNF31 or both RNF31 and p53 in MCF-7 cells. RNF31 depletion
reduced the number of cells in S phase, an effect that was reversed
on depletion of p53 (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1A).
In order to test the effect of RNF31 in an additional cell line
and to employ an alternative assay (ethynly-deoxyuridine (EdU)

incorporation), RNF31 or both RNF31 and p53 were depleted in
both MCF-7 cells and ZR-75-1 cells. RNF31 depletion decreased
EdU incorporation in both cells lines (Figures 2b and c, and
Supplementary Figures S1B and C), whereas an additional
depletion of p53 restored the EdU incorporation. Next, we
investigated whether RNF31 had an impact on cisplatin sensitivity.
As shown in Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure S2A, siRNF31
increased cisplatin sensitivity in ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175 cells, as
measured by cell viability at increasing concentrations of cisplatin.
MCF-7 cells are relatively resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis
due to the lack of caspase-3 expression, the main effector of
apoptosis, and were therefore not explored in these studies.22 The
potential effect of RNF31 depletion for cisplatin-induced apoptosis
was explored in ZR-75-1 cells. By propidium iodide and annexin V
double staining, we found that siRNF31 increased cisplatininduced apoptosis, which in turn was restored by depletion of
p53 (Figure 2e and Supplementary Figure S2B). Furthermore,
Figure 2f shows that RNF31 depletion increased activated
caspase-3 in the presence of cisplatin, whereas depletion of p53
in addition to RNF31 depletion restored activated caspase-3 to the

expression of the p53 target genes, p21 (CDKN1A), IGFBP3 and
BTG2, were observed using the same four individual siRNAs
(Figure 3b).
RNF31 depletion increased p53 levels in three distinct
breast cancer cell lines that all express wt p53 (MCF-7, ZR-75-1
and MDA-MB-175;23 Figures 3c–e). Furthermore, cisplatininduced p53 levels were further enhanced by RNF31 depletion
in all these three cell lines (Figures 3c–e). In addition,
RNF31 depletion caused increased expression of the p53target genes p21, IGFBP3 and BTG2 in all the three breast cancer
cell lines (Figures 3f–h). Furthermore, cisplatin-induction of
these genes was further enhanced by RNF31 depletion
(Figures 3f–h).

suggesting that RNF31 directly regulates p53 protein levels.
Furthermore, when cells were treated with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132, there was no further increase of p53 in
RNF31-depleted cells (Figure 4c). Finally, RNF31 depletion
signiﬁcantly increased the half-life of endogenous p53
(Figure 4d), whereas overexpression of RNF31 increases p53
degradation in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4e). Together, these data
suggest that RNF31 regulates the stability and subsequent
protein levels of p53.

system, as the known regulation of MDM2 mRNA by p53 could be
a confounder when we study the effects on p53 protein stability in
a system where MDM2 is derived from the endogenous gene.
Association of RNF31 with the p53/MDM2 complex was conﬁrmed
in HEK293 cells after the introduction of RNF31, p53 and MDM2
(Figure 5b). Figure 5c shows that RNF31 still interacts with p53 in
the presence of Nutlin-3 (compare lanes 7 and 3), which blocks the
interaction between p53 and MDM2 (compare lanes 8 and 4),
whereas the RNF31 association with MDM2 was partially blocked
by Nutlin-3. This suggests that RNF31 associates with p53
independent of the p53-MDM2 interaction, whereas RNF31’s
association with MDM2 at least partially depends on the
p53-MDM2 interaction. HEK293 cells were used to investigate
the function of RNF31 on the p53/MDM2 complex. As shown in

Figures 5d and e, MDM2-mediated p53-polyubiquitination was
increased by RNF31. Interestingly, in the presence of Nutlin-3,
RNF31 depletion did not increase p53 protein levels or the
expression of its target genes (Figure 5f and Supplementary
Figure S4B). Thus, MDM2 may have an important role in mediating
the RNF31-mediated effect on p53 protein stability.

inhibitor (MG132), RNF31 did not further increase MDM2 protein
levels (Figure 6c) and we observed a decreased polyubiquitination
of MDM2 in the presence of RNF31 (Figures 6d and e). Importantly,
as shown in Figure 6f, RNF31 depletion increased endogenous
MDM2 polyubiquitination in MCF-7 cells. In summary, these data
suggest that RNF31 stabilizes the MDM2 protein, thereby
increasing p53 polyubiquitination resulting in decreased p53
protein stability.
DISCUSSION
In this report we demonstrate that the RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase
RNF31 associates with the MDM2/p53 complex. We propose a
Oncogene (2016) 1955 – 1964

model where RNF31 stabilizes MDM2, resulting in increased p53
ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation. Furthermore, RNF31
depletion induces the p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle arrest and
facilitates cisplatin-induced apoptosis, making it an interesting
therapeutic target.
In this study we describe the effects of RNF31 on p53 levels,
cellular proliferation and apoptosis under non-stressed and
stressed (cisplatin induced) conditions (Figures 2e and f). We
show that RNF31 depletion was associated with increased p53
protein levels under both non-stressed and stressed conditions
(Figures 3c–e). Furthermore, RNF31 depletion was associated with
decreased cell proliferation under both non-stressed and stressed
conditions (Figures 2b and c, and Table 1). On the contrary, RNF31

depletion was only associated with increased apoptosis under
stressed conditions (Figures 2e and f). This is consistent with our
observation that overexpression of p53 did not increase apoptosis
under non-stressed conditions (Supplementary Figure S3).
This is in line with the described diverse effects of p53 on cell
proliferation and apoptosis.24,25
RNF31 was initially cloned from breast cancer cells based on its
elevated mRNA expression and shown to display higher
expression in breast tumors compared with adjacent tissues.7
Based on this information, we hypothesize that deregulated
expression of RNF31 may contribute to breast cancer development and/or growth. We used an unbiased approach to
identify signaling pathways that are regulated by RNF31 in
breast cancer cells. Interestingly, this approach identiﬁed p53
signaling as a potential target of RNF31. RING ﬁnger protein
family members harbor E3 ubiquitin ligase functions and some of
them have been demonstrated to modify p53 protein levels
and p53 signaling.19–22,24 However, the effects could be
quite different by different E3 ubiquitin ligases. For example,

signaling and promote breast cancer progression.19,20 RNF31 is
similar to BRCA1 in stabilizing a protein, in this case MDM2. On
the other hand, RNF31 is distinct from BRCA1 in that it
suppresses p53 signaling and facilitates breast cancer cell
progression. Future studies need to address the relative
importance of, and potential synergy between, different
members of E3 ubiquitin ligases in relation to modifying p53
signaling in cancer.
The RBR family includes several atypical E3 ligases, such as
RNF31, RBCK1 and Parkin (PARK2).3,27 These proteins mainly
localize to the cytoplasm, but harbor the ability to translocate to
the nucleus.28 Furthermore, RBR proteins have been shown to
associate with transcriptional factors and regulate the corresponding pathways.23,28 Importantly, RBR proteins can ubiquitinate
several proteins, thereby modifying their downstream signal
transduction pathways. However, the functions of RBR proteins
need further exploration.

RNF31 degrades p53 in breast cancer cells
J Zhu et al

1962
As one of the RBR family members, RNF31 regulates nuclear
factor-κB, ERα and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase pathways in
cancers.5,29–31 RNF31 also mediates protein stabilization by
ubiquitination in these pathways distinct from the classical
mechanism of polyubiquitination-mediated protein degradation.
Consistent with this, we demonstrate that RNF31 stabilizes MDM2,
which in turn regulates p53 levels. The details of how RNF31
interacts with MDM2 need further investigation. For example, it
remains to be determined whether RNF31 directly interacts with
p53 and/or MDM2 by analyzing potential interactions between
puriﬁed proteins.
In this study, we examined the role of RNF31 on p53 signaling in
three distinct breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDAMB-175, which are all ERα positive and express wild-type p53. We
previously reported that RNF31 facilitates ERα signaling and
proliferation in breast cancer cells.5 We demonstrated a nongenomic mechanism by which RNF31 could stabilize the ERα
(ERα/ESR1) and enhance its signaling.5 In addition, ERα has been
shown to suppress the function of p53 in relation to gene
regulation.32 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that RNF31 exerts
its effect on p53 via ERα signaling. The relative importance of the
effect of RNF31 on ERα and p53 signaling in relation to cell
proliferation needs to be addressed.
Functional p53 is required for chemotherapy-induced cell death
in cancer.25,33 Modulation of p53 protein levels is one approach to
increase p53 signaling and downstream cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. Treatment with the compound Nutlin-3, which blocks
the interaction between MDM2 and p53, and thereby stabilizes
p53, causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.34,35 Consistently,
Nutlin-3 was effective in several cancers when combined with
chemotherapy.36–38 We found that RNF31 depletion could arrest
the cell cycle and enhance cisplatin-induced cell death, providing
insight into the molecular mechanism for the regulation of p53
signaling in breast cancer cells. As a novel target to affect p53
signaling, inhibition of RNF31 activity may be a potential therapy
to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

RNA extraction and quantitative PCR analysis
RNeasy kits were used to extract total RNA (Qiagen, Stockholm, Sweden).
After that 1 μg RNA was subject to reverse transcription. Next, quantitative
PCR was performed as previously described.27 36B4 was used as the
internal control.5 Primer sequences for quantitative PCR are provided in
Supplementary Table S1.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer. After that, 10 μg protein lysis was
subject to immunobloting. Anti-GAPDH (ab8425), anti-RNF31 (ab46322)
and anti-caspase-3 (ab32351) antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge,
UK). Anti-Flag (F9291) and anti-GFP (G1544) antibodies were from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Anti-myc (9E10), anti-ubiquitin (FL76)
and anti-p53 (DO1 and FL-393) antibodies were from Santa Cruz.

Quantiﬁcation of cell viability
ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175 cells were transfected with siRNF31 or siControl
in 24-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates with
104 cells in each well. Next, cells were treated with the indicated
concentration of cisplatin. The cell numbers were determined using the
WST-1 cell proliferation reagent as previously described.23

Flow cytometry
For propidium iodide staining, 106 MCF-7 cells were seeded in 10-cm
dishes. After 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNF31, sip53 or siControl.
After an additional 24 h, cells were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol for 30 min and
stained by propidium iodide. For EdU-labeled DNA stain, cells were
transfected with siRNF31, sip53 and siControl. After 24 h, 10 μM EdU was
added into each plate for the last 60 min. The BD LSR II ﬂow cytometer
(BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used to measure the ﬂow of
ﬂuorescence intensity. For apoptosis assays, ZR-75-1 cells were seeded in
10-cm dishes and transfected with siRNF31, sip53 or siControl. After 24 h,
cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μM cisplatin. After another 24 h, cells
were stained by propidium iodide and annexin V. The BD LSR II ﬂow was
used to measure the ﬂow ﬂuorescence intensity.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Co-immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as previously described.40
First, 100 μg cell lysates were pre-cleared with rabbit IgG for 2 h and
subsequently incubated overnight with RNF31 rabbit antibody (ab46322),
whereas rabbit IgG was used as the negative control. The bound proteins
were analyzed by western blot with mouse MDM2 and p53 antibody.
For overexpression experiment, HEK293 cells were transfected with
10 μg Flag-RNF31, myc-MDM2 and p53 plasmids in 10-cm dish. Cell lysates
were pre-cleared with rabbit IgG for 2 h and subsequently incubated
overnight with Flag rabbit antibody/myc rabbit antibody/p53 rabbit
antibody, whereas rabbit IgG was used as the negative control. The
bound proteins were analyzed by western blotting with mouse antibodies.

The original MCF-7 cells were obtained from the Michigan Cancer
Foundation (Detroit, MI, USA). The MDA-MB-175 cells and HEK293 cells
come from ATCC cell bank. The ZR-75-1 cells developed from ATCC (LGC
Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany) cell bank and were kindly provided by
Dr Bergh Jonas. MCF-7 and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175 cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cisplatin was purchased from Santa Cruz
(Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were periodically tested for mycoplasma
contamination and were not used for more than 3 months after being
thawed.

MCF-7 cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNF31 or siControl. Twenty-four
hours post transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μM) or
MG132 (10 μM), or MCF-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg Flag-RNF31 or
Flag vector, and 48 h post transfection cells were treated with
cycloheximide (100 μM) for indicated time points. Samples were analyzed
by western blotting for p53 degradation.

Plasmids

Analysis of protein ubiquitination

RNF31 (pcDNA-MYC-RNF31 and pcDNA-Flag-RNF31) constructs were
previously described.28 p53 and MYC-MDM2 plasmids were obtained from
the Addgene Company (Cambridge, MA, USA) and were previously
described.39

HEK293 cells (107 cells) were transfected with 4 μg pCMV-myc-MDM2
together with 4 μg pCDNA3-Flag-RNF31. Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 or ethanol for 2 h and thereafter
lysed. Modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed p53, respectively, were detected by
western blot analysis.

Protein stability assays

siRNA transfection
Cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA. RNF31 siRNAs correspond to the
siGENOME SMARTpool RNF31 (Dharmacon, Epsom, UK; D-0021419). p53
siRNA and control siRNA are Stealth Select siRNA (Invitrogen). INTERFERin
transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) was used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

J Zhu et al

1963
The supernatant was collected and immunoprecipitated with 20 μl
ubiquitin beads (CalBiochem, Darmstadt, Germany; 662200). Western
blotting with anti-p53 (DO1) antibody was performed to detect
ubiquitinated p53.

Sub-network enrichment of differentially expressed genes
Analysis was performed for differentially expressed genes (Po0.001 and
fold change 42) using microarray data previously published5 and the
Pathway Studio software (Elsevier, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). P-values
indicating overrepresentation using the Pathway Studio Gene Ontology
analysis were calculated with Fisher’s exact test and considered signiﬁcant
when Po0.001.

Analysis of gene expression in publicly available data sets
Analysis of gene expression in 1106 breast cancer samples from The
Cancer Genome Atlas was carried out in the statistical environment R.41
Presented correlations are Pearson’s product–moment correlations.
Samples were separated into high/low expression of RNF31 by setting a
cutoff at the median value.

Statistics
Student’s t-test, Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient and Cox regression
analysis were used for comparisons. A P-value ofo0.05 was considered
to be signiﬁcant.
