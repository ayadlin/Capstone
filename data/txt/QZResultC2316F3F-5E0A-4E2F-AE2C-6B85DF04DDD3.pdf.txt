ABSTRACT
ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle to
successful chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Herein, afatinib at nontoxic concentrations
significantly reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR in ovarian cancer cells in vitro (p < 0.05).
Combining paclitaxel and afatinib caused tumor regressions and tumor necrosis in
A2780T xenografts in vivo. More interestingly, unlike reversible TKIs, afatinib had a
distinctive dual-mode action. Afatinib not only inhibited the efflux function of ABCB1,
but also attenuated its expression transcriptionally via down-regulation of PI3K/AKT
and MAPK/p38-dependent activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, apart from a substrate
binding domain, afatinib could also bind to an ATP binding domain of ABCB1 through
forming hydrogen bonds with Gly533, Gly534, Lys536 and Ala560 sites. Importantly,
mutations in these four binding sites of ABCB1 and the tyrosine kinase domain of
EGFR were not correlated with the reversal activity of afatinib on MDR. Given that
afatinib is a clinically approved drug, our results suggest combining afatinib with
chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian cancer. This study can facilitate the rediscovery
of superior MDR reversal agents from molecular targeted drugs to provide a more
effective and safer way of resensitizing MDR.

binding model between TKIs and ABCB1 was rarely
investigated.
The most critical challenge for TKI therapeutics
is also the development of drug-resistance [18]. Despite
the initial response, patients almost invariably become
resistant to TKIs gradually and relapse after several
months. One important reason is that most approved TKIs
are transported by ABC transporters, which results in an
altered pharmacokinetics of these TKIs in cancer patients
[18]. More seriously, as a substrate, longtime treatment
often induces the up-regulation of ABC transporters,
which further aggravates the resistance of conventional
chemotherapy drugs [19, 20]. Therefore, it is of great
medical significance that if a TKI could dynamically
attenuate the expression of ABCB1, as this may further
enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy drugs
and avoid its own drug-resistance. Unfortunately, to date,
no TKIs at reversal concentrations have been reported to
attenuate the expression of ABCB1.

INTRODUCTION
ABCB1-mediated MDR remains a major obstacle
to successful chemotherapy in the clinic [1–5]. ABCB1
is highly expressed in human ovarian cancer and its
overexpression is correlated inversely with a benign response
to chemotherapy and good clinical prognosis [6, 7]. For this
reason, tremendous efforts have been made to discover or
synthesize ABCB1 inhibitors to reverse ABCB1-mediated
MDR in the past decades [8–11]. One more efficient solution
is to rediscover new applications of existing drugs with
known pharmacokinetics and safety profiles.
Nowadays, tyrosine kinases have become the
second most important group of drug targets after
G-protein-coupled receptors [12]. It is reported that
several TKIs could only statically inhibit the efflux
function of ABCB1 and thus enhance the anticancer
efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs [13–17]. However,
the mechanisms are still not very clear. Furthermore, the

Afatinib is the first irreversible multi-targeted TKI,
functioning by selectively inhibiting EGFR and HER-2
and thereby attenuating the downstream oncogenic
signaling pathways correlated with cancer proliferation,
invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. It obtained FDA
approval for first-line treatment of patients with EGFRmutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in June 2013
and is also in clinical trials for various solid tumors with
encouraging prospects [21–23]. Considering the increasing
use of afatinib and the universality of ABCB1 substrate
drugs in the clinic, an understanding of the interaction
between afatinib and ABCB1 is necessary and of vital
medical significance for dosage adjustment of ABCB1
substrate drugs during their combination treatment with
afatinib. However, until now, no studies have reported the
interaction between afatinib and ABCB1.
Unlike reversible TKIs, afatinib is an ATPcompetitive aniline-quinazoline compound that covalently
binds to the Cys773 of EGFR and Cys805 of HER-2
and irreversibly inhibits them [24, 25]. An irreversible
tyrosine kinase blockade may result in the longer
suppression of correlated signaling than reversible TKIs,
thus producing more outstanding therapeutic effects [26,
27]. In consideration of its dual receptor and irreversible
inhibition, we wonder whether afatinib is also superior
in reacting with ABCB1 and whether the irreversible
inhibition will offer some unique effects.
In this paper, in vitro, in vivo and in silico
experiments were conducted to determine whether
afatinib could resensitize multidrug resistant cancer cells
to conventional chemotherapy drugs by interacting with
ABCB1 and to uncover its mechanisms.

were used as the maximum concentrations in the reversal
assays for SKOV3, SKOV3-DDP, SKOV3/ABCB1¯ and
SKOV3-DDP/ABCB1¯ cells, respectively.
As shown in Table 1, The ABCB1-overexpressing
A2780T and SKOV3-DDP cells showed significant
resistant phenotype to ABCB1 substrate drugs (paclitaxel
and adriamycin). Afatinib at nontoxic concentrations
strongly decreased the IC50 values of paclitaxel and
adriamycin in a concentration-dependent manner in
ABCB1-overexpressing A2780T and SKOV3-DDP
cells. In contrast, afatinib didn’t alter the cytotoxicity
of paclitaxel and adriamycin in A2780 and SKOV3
cells, which expressed low levels of ABCB1 protein. As
shown in Table 2, knockdown of ABCB1 in A2780T and
SKOV3-DDP cells further enhanced the reversal effect of
afatinib on MDR. Taken together, these results indicated
that afatinib could reverse the MDR to ABCB1 substrate
drugs in ABCB1-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. In
addition, afatinib could also reverse the MDR to ABCG2
substrate drugs (mitoxantrone and topotecan) in A2780T
and SKOV3-DDP cells, while having no effect on the
MDR to chlorambucil, which was an ABCC1 substrate
drug (data not shown).

Afatinib reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR in vivo
As shown in Supplementary Figure S1B, the average
weights of tumors were 0.707 ± 0.229 g, 0.655 ± 0.289 g,
0.247 ± 0.088 g and 0.113 ± 0.079 g for control, paclitaxel,
afatinib and the combination group, respectively. There were
no significant differences in both the tumor volumes (Figure
1E and 1F, Supplementary Figure S1A) and tumor weights
(Supplementary Figure S1B) between paclitaxel group and
control group (p > 0.05), indicating the in vivo resistance
to paclitaxel. However, the combination of paclitaxel and
afatinib not only significantly delayed the growth of A2780T
xenografts, but also induced significant tumor regressions
with an inhibition rate of 84.02% (Figure 1F). Furthermore,
compared with afatinib group, no treatment-correlated
mortality or apparent decrease in body weight (Figure 1G)
were observed, indicating the combination didn’t induce
additional adverse drug reactions.

RESULTS
Afatinib reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR in
ABCB1-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells
in vitro
As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, the expression levels
of ABCB1 in four kinds of ovarian cancer cells (A2780T,
A2780, SKOV3-DDP and SKOV3) were knocked down
by ABCB1-specific siRNA. Subsequently, MTT assays
were conducted to obtain the combination concentrations
of afatinib in different kinds of cells. As shown in Figure
1C and 1D, there was a significant difference in the
susceptibility of various cells to afatinib alone. More than
90% of the cells were viable with a concentration up to
0.5 μM afatinib for A2780 cells, 2.5 μM for A2780T
cells, 0.5 μM for A2780/ABCB1¯ cells and 1.25 μM
for A2780T/ABCB1¯ cells. Accordingly, afatinib at
concentrations of 0.5 μM, 2.5 μM, 0.5 μM and 1.25 μM
were used as the maximum concentrations in the reversal
assays for A2780, A2780T, A2780/ABCB1¯ and A2780T/
ABCB1¯ cells, respectively. Similarly, afatinib at
concentrations of 0.2 μM, 1.5 μM, 0.2 μM and 1.5 μM

Afatinib enhanced the paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, afatinib at nontoxic
concentrations significantly increased the percentage of
apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in multidrug-resistant
A2780T and SKOV3-DDP cells. Furthermore, few
isolated positive nuclei were observed in tumors of saline,
paclitaxel or afatinib group, whereas abundant apoptotic
nuclei were clearly exhibited in the combination group
(Figure 2C). Moreover, combining paclitaxel with afatinib
induced remarkable nucleus rupture and nuclear mass
leak, indicating a high occurrence ratio of tumornecrosis.

assay was conducted to examine whether the increase
of accumulation was achieved by decreasing the efflux
function of ABCB1. As shown in Figure 3C, afatinib
significantly decreased the efflux of rhodamine 123 in
A2780T cells while having no effect on that in A2780
cells. To sum up, afatinib significantly increased the
accumulation of rhodamine 123 both in vitro and in vivo
by inhibiting the efflux function of ABCB1.

5A, afatinib remarkably blocked the phosphorylation
of Akt without affecting total Akt levels, which was in
consistent with Chao’s study [29]. Meanwhile, LY294002,
a specific inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, also significantly
suppressed the nuclear translocation of p65 (Figure 5B).
Moreover, the combination of afatinib and LY294002
induced additive inhibitory effects on ABCB1 expression
(Figure 5D), suggesting that afatinib might suppress NFκB activity through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Afatinib stimulated the ATPase activity

EGFR mutations were not correlated with
the reversal efficacy of afatinib on MDR in

Energy consumption during the efflux process of
ABCB1 comes from ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, effect
of afatinib on ABCB1-mediated ATP hydrolysis was
evaluated. Both afatinib and paclitaxel stimulated the
ATPase activity of ABCB1 (Figure 3D) during a shorttime incubation with recombinant human ABCB1
membranes. Generally, the substrates of ABCB1 stimulate
its ATPase activity. Hence, like paclitaxel, afatinib may
also be a substrate of ABCB1. Besides, the concentrations
required for 50% stimulation of the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 were about 2.5 μM for afatinib and 70.1 μM for
paclitaxel, suggesting that afatinib had much stronger
affinity with ABCB1 than paclitaxel (Figure 3E, 3F).

More than 90% of EGFR mutations occur in the
tyrosine kinase domain, which are encoded by exon 18,
exon 19, exon 20 and exon 21 of the EGFR gene [30, 31].
As shown in Figure 5F, all the four exons were wide-type
in both drug-sensitive cells (A2780 and SKOV3 cells)
and multidrug-resistant cells (A2780T and SKOV3-DDP
cells). These results indicated that EGFR mutations were
not correlated with the reversal efficacy of afatinib on
MDR in ovarian cancer.

Blockage of the MAPK/p38 pathway contributed
to the reversal effect of afatinib

Afatinib attenuated the expression of ABCB1by
inhibiting the activation of NF-κB

Inhibition of the MAPK pathway may partially
restore the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer
cells [32]. As afatinib is a TKI targeting EGFR and HER-2,
of which the major downstream signaling pathways
include the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Therefore, the effects
of afatinib on the expression of total and phosphorylated
ERK1/2, JNK and p38 were examined. As shown in
Figure 5E, afatinib at reversal concentrations significantly
blocked the phosphorylation of p38 in A2780T cells,
whereas it didn’t alter the expression level of total and
phosphorylated ERK1/2 or JNK. Since MAPK/p38 is also
the upstream regulatory protein of the PI3K/AKT and
NF-κB pathway, these results indicated that afatinib could
attenuate the expression of ABCB1 via down-regulation
of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/p38-dependent activation of
NF-κB (Figure 5G).

Afatinib could dramatically attenuate the expression
of MDR1 mRNA (Figure 4A and 4B) and ABCB1 protein
(Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S2) in ABCB1overexpressing A2780T and SKOV3-DDP cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, whereas lapatinib (a
reversible TKI targeting to EGFR and HER-2) having
no effect on that. Moreover, both immunohistochemical
(Figure 4C) and immunofluorescent assays (Figure 4D)
showed that afatinib could also attenuate the expression
of ABCB1 protein in tumor tissues in vivo. In addition,
both PDTC (a specific NF-κB inhibitor) and p65-specific
siRNA could attenuate the expression of ABCB1 protein
(Figure 5A and 5C) and MDR1 mRNA (Supplementary
Figure S3). To evaluate whether NF-κB pathway
was involved in the observed suppression of ABCB1
expression by afatinib, the effect of afatinib on the NFκB pathway was assessed. As shown in Figure 5A,
afatinib attenuated the expression of the NF-κB subunit
p65 both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Meanwhile,
afatinib decreased the phosphorylation and degradation
of IκBα. The nuclear translocation of p65 is essential for
the activation of NF-κB pathway. As shown in Figure 5B,
like PDTC, afatinib abrogated both the constitutive and
LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p65. In conclusion,
afatinib could attenuate the expression of ABCB1 by
inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB.
PI3K/Akt pathway is closely involved in the
regulation of NF-κB activity [28]. As shown in Figure

Structural basis of afatinib as an
ABCB1 inhibitor
To identify the structural basis of afatinib as an
inhibitor of ABCB1, a novel pharmacophore model was
developed on the basis of two selective and potent ABCB1
inhibitors including tariquidar [33] and zosuquidar
[34]. The critical pharmacophore features necessary for
ABCB1 inhibitors were identified (Figure 6A). The best
pharmacophore model had five features, including one
aromatic center (AR), one hydrophobic center (HP) and
three hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs). Afatinib formed
an impressive alignment with this model. To be specific:

made to circumvent or reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR.
On one hand, ABCB1-mediated MDR could be indirectly
overcome by exploring new drug combination strategies
through exploiting the interaction between drugs and ABC
transporters, which could even have extra benefits. For
example, MV Blagosklonny reported that a “two drug”
strategy enabled selective killing of resistant leukemia
cells, whereas parental cells were fully protected [36]. In
addition, it had been reported that treatment with inhibitors
of caspases, that were substrates of drug transporters,
could selectively permit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
in multidrug-resistant cells but protect normal cells [37].
On the other hand, discovering or synthesizing ABCB1
inhibitors to reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR is more
direct and has been the primary means in the past decades
[8–11].
Ovarian cancer is the most fatal malignancy of the
female reproductive tract, causing more deaths than all
other gynecologic cancers combined [38]. Paclitaxel and
platinum combination chemotherapy has remained the
global first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with
ovarian cancer for the past 20 years [38]. However, ~80%
of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced
stage and these patients are intrinsically resistant to
chemotherapy mainly due to ABCB1-mediated MDR
[6, 7, 38]. Therefore, it is of vital medical significance to
overcome or reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR in patients
with ovarian cancer.
In the present study, afatinib robustly reversed
the MDR to paclitaxel and adriamycin (Table 1), and
increased the apoptosis ratio induced by paclitaxel in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells (Figure 2). Knockdown of
ABCB1 partly by siRNA further enhanced the reverse
efficacy of afatinib on MDR (Table 2), indicating that
the efficacy of afatinib in reversing MDR was associated
with its interaction with ABCB1. More meaningfully,
the combination of paclitaxel and afatinib induced
significant tumor regressions (Figure 1F) and tumor
necrosis (Figure 2C) of the A2780T xenografts in vivo as
well as delaying their growth. It is reported that apatinib
and saracatinib could reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR
[13, 14, 17]. However, their efficacies were weaker than
that of afatinib. In contrast, their concentrations needed
for reversing MDR were higher. More importantly, they
only delayed the growth of tumors, but not induced tumor
regressions. Taken together, several different experiments
suggest that afatinib has a superior efficacy in reversing
ABCB1-mediated MDR both in vitro and in vivo.
Xiao-kun Wang et al. reported that afatinib could
reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR, while not enhancing the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in resistant cells that expressed
ABCB1 [39]. By comparison, we found that there was a
significant difference in the susceptibility of various cells
to afatinib alone. Human ovarian cancer cell lines used in
our study are much more resistant to afatinib than cells
used in Xiao-kun Wang’s study. Therefore, the reversal

Binding mode between afatinib and ABCB1
To determine the binding mode between afatinib
and human ABCB1, the 3D structure of human ABCB1
(Figure 6B) was generated by homology modeling. All the
scores of various validation methods including PROCHECK,
ERRAT and PROSA (Supplementary Table S1), and the
ramachandran plot results (Supplementary Figure S4)
verified its quality. Afatinib was successfully docked into
both a substrate binding domain and an ATP binding domain
of this model (Figure 6B). The substrate binding domain was
a large flexible binding pocket, which could host different
substrates [35]. This finding also was in consistent with the
universality of ABCB1 substrate drugs. Furthermore, the
docking score for the ATP binding domain (–14.05 kcal/
mol) was very close to that of the substrate binding domain
(–14.09 kcal/mol), indicating that the binding of afatinib at
the ATP binding domain might also be with high affinity. The
interactions between afatinib and the ATP binding domain
of ABCB1 included three hydrogen bonds and an arenehydrogen interaction. The oxygen atom of oxolane in afatinib
formed two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Gly533 and
Gly534. Interestingly, the oxygen atom of oxolane in afatinib
was also identified as an HBA feature in the pharmacophore
model as mentioned above, which verified the reliability of the
pharmacophore model. Besides, the tertiary amine of afatinib
formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys536 while
the N-containing heterocyclic of afatinib formed an arene
hydrogen interaction with Ala560. A 378-bp fragment of
MDR1 gene, encompassing the sequence for Gly533, Gly534,
Lys536 and Ala560 of ABCB1 protein, was amplified. As
shown in Figure 6D, DNA sequencing results showed that the
normal human cells (liver LO2 cells) and four kinds of ovarian
cells were all wide-type in this fragment region of MDR1
gene. In addition, afatinib treatment also didn’t induce gene
mutations in these four sites in both drug-sensitive A2780 cells
and multidrug resistant A2780T cells. These results indicated
that mutations in these four sites were not correlated with the
reversal efficacy of afatinib on MDR in multidrug resistant
ovarian cancer cells. In summary, the docking simulation
study indicated that afatinib might bind to the ATP binding
domain of ABCB1 through forming hydrogen bonds with
Gly533, Gly534, Lys536 and Ala560 sites of ABCB1.

DISCUSSION
Multidrug resistance (MDR), mainly mediated
by the ABCB1 transporter, remains a major obstacle to
successful chemotherapy. Tremendous attempts have been

concentrations of afatinib used in ABCB1-overexpressing
cell lines in our study (0.375–2.5 μM) were much higher
than those used in his study (0.025–0.1 μM). Afatinib
under 0.25 μM also couldn’t reverse the drug-resistance
to adriamycin and paclitaxel in this study. Therefore, the
reversal effect of afatinib on MDR may be concentration
dependent. The huge concentration differences of afatinib
between the two studies may be responsible for the
different results.
Mechanistically, afatinib significantly enhanced the
intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 in ABCB1overexpressing cells and tumors by decreasing the efflux
function of ABCB1. In consideration of the universality of
ABCB1 substrate drugs and the increasing use of afatinib
in the clinic, these quantitative results offered a theoretical
basis for dosage adjustments of ABCB1 substrate drugs
during their combination treatment with afatinib in the
clinic. Furthermore, several TKIs could interact with
ABCB1, thereby inhibiting its efflux of chemotherapeutic
agents [13, 17]. However, the mechanisms are still not
very clear. Most reports hypothesize that these TKIs are
also substrates of ABCB1 and share substrate binding
domains with chemotherapeutic drugs. The competitive
binding of these TKIs to the substrate binding domains
relieves the binding of chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby
decreasing their efflux [18]. In this study, afatinib could
stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and was less
cytotoxic in ABCB1-overexpressing cells, indicating
that afatinib may also be a substrate of ABCB1. Further,
by homology modeling and a docking simulation, we
found that afatinib could be docked into a substrate
binding domain of ABCB1. This finding also supports the
hypothesis that afatinib could inhibit the efflux function of
ABCB1 by competitively binding to the substrate binding
domain.
In addition, we hypothesize that TKIs can inhibit the
function of ABCB1 by binding to the ATP binding domain
of ABCB1 and thereby cut the energy supply needed for
transport process. No studies have tested this hypothesis.
Similarly, by docking simulations, we found that afatinib
might bind to the ATP binding domain of ABCB1 with
high affinity by forming hydrogen bonds with Gly533,
Gly534, Lys536 and Ala560 sites of ABCB1 (Figure
6C). Most ABCB1 inhibitors compete with other ABCB1
substrates for access to the binding pocket on ABCB1 and
are called type I inhibitors. Their inhibitory effects are
often limited as achieving an inhibitory effect on ABCB1
often requires high concentrations, which may cause
toxicity problems. In fact, the first generation of ABCB1
inhibitors failed in the clinic mainly because of this
problem. More effective and promising, type II inhibitors
could bind to the ATP binding domains of ABCB1, cutting
off the energy supply needed during the efflux process.
Or they could bind to other domains that can modulate
the conformation of ABCB1 and thus abolish the efflux
function of ABCB1. Therefore, the finding that afatinib
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

might bind to the ATP binding domain of ABCB1 could be
the reason for the superior efficacy of afatinib in reversing
ABCB1-mediated MDR. Furthermore, since substrate
promiscuity is a hallmark of ABCB1 activity, a structural
description of poly-specific drug-binding is important for
the rational design of ABCB1 inhibitors [40]. From this
viewpoint, the human ABCB1 model generated in this
study, along with the docking simulation attempts may
help subsequent researchers verify whether a drug has the
potential to be developed as a reversal agent for ABCB1mediated MDR.
The reversal of ABCB1-mediated MDR could be
achieved either by inhibiting the function or attenuating
the expression of ABCB1. Further studies showed that
afatinib could attenuate the expression of ABCB1 both at
protein and mRNA levels (Figures 4 and 5A). It is widely
reported that TKIs could inhibit the function of ABCB1
[13–15]. However, to our best knowledge, it hasn’t
been reported that any TKI at nontoxic concentrations
could attenuate the expression of ABCB1. In this study,
lapatinib, a reversible TKI targeting EGFR and HER-2,
also could not attenuate the expression of ABCB1. On
the contrary, longtime administration of imatinib and
lapatinib could enhance the expression of ABCB1 as
they are substrates of ABCB1, which even aggravates the
resistance of other combinational chemotherapy drugs [18,
19]. Herein, for the first time, we found that afatinib at
nontoxic concentrations could dynamically reverse MDR
by attenuating the expression of ABCB1, while reversible
TKIs couldn’t achieve that. This finding indicates that
afatinib is a more promising and unique reversal agent for
ABCB1-mediated MDR.
NF-κB is an important factor in the transcriptional
regulation of many genes. Inactive NF-κB dimers,
composed of p65 and p50 subunits, are sequestered
in the cytoplasm in association with the inhibitory
molecules of the IκB family. Stimulation on cells
causes phosphorylation of the inhibitor IκB, leading
to its polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
degradation, and the release of active NF-κB. ABCB1
is encoded by the MDR1gene, which is located on 7,
q21.1 chromosome. It is reported that an NF-κB binding
domain (5′-GGGGAATTCC-3′) is located between base
pairs −167 and −158 of MDR1 promoter region and could
activate MDR1 gene transcription [41]. Furthermore,
inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB could attenuate
the expression of ABCB1 [42]. In this study, afatinib
attenuated the expression and nuclear translocation of
the NF-κB subunit p65 and blocked both constitutive and
inducible activation of the NF-κB. In addition, both PDTC
(a specific NF-κB inhibitor) and p65-specific siRNA
attenuated the expression of ABCB1 (Figure 5A–5C).
These results indicated that afatinib could attenuate the
expression of ABCB1 transcriptionally by inhibiting the
activation of NF-κB. Further studies showed that upstream
PI3K/AKT and MAPK/p38 pathways were involved
26154

Oncotarget

in the regulatory effect of afatinib on the activation of
NF-κB. As inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway may
partially restore sensitivity to cisplatinum in cancer cells
[43], this finding also explains the reason why afatinib
could reverse the resistance to cisplatinum, which is
not a substrate of ABCB1 (Table 1). Considering that
paclitaxel and platinum combination chemotherapy has
remained the global first-line chemotherapy regiment for
patients with ovarian cancer. This finding further proves
the superiority of afatinib as a reversal drug. To sum up,
afatinib attenuated the expression of ABCB1 by inhibiting
its transcription via down-regulation of PI3K/AKT and
MAPK/p38-dependent activation of NF-κB (Figure 5G).
Afatinib, an EGFR-targeted TKI, obtained FDA
approval for first-line treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
patients. These mutations include exon 19 deletions and
exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. It means that
afatinib is more effective in EGFR-mutated cancer cells.
Therefore, it’s possible that the efficacy of afatinib in
reversing ABCB1-mediated MDR in multidrug resistant
cells is because of EGFR mutations occurring in multidrug
resistant cells. To exclude this possibility, gene sequencing
experiments were performed and the results showed that
EGFR mutations were not correlated with the reversal
efficacy of afatinib on MDR in ovarian cancer.
The most critical challenge for TKI therapeutics
is also the development of drug-resistance [18]. Despite
an initial response, patients almost invariably become
resistant to TKIs gradually and relapse after several
months. One important reason is that most approved TKIs
are substrates and are transported by ABC transporters,
resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or an obvious
resistance to these drugs in cancer patients [19]. More
seriously, as a substrate, longtime treatment often induces
the up-regulation of ABC transporters, which further
aggravates the resistance of conventional chemotherapy
drugs [19, 20]. Consequently, TKIs that could attenuate
the expression of ABC transporters may affect their own
metabolism and thus diminish their own resistance. From
this viewpoint, afatinib may overcome its own ABCB1mediated drug resistance in the clinic. As expected, it was
reported that afatinib showed a potent inhibitory activity
even in in vitro models which were resistant to firstgeneration EGFR TKIs, and was still effective in NSCLC
patients that showed no or low response to gefitinib or
erlotinib [44]. We speculate that its covalent binding
to tyrosine kinase active domains and its irreversible
inhibition on EGFR and HER-2 may be responsible
for these phenomena, as an irreversible tyrosine kinase
blockade may result in a longer suppression of ErbB
signaling, leading to better treatment outcomes. However,
more studies should be taken, especially structural
chemistry assays.
In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates
that afatinib is a potential and superior reversal
drug for ABCB1-mediated MDR in human ovarian
cancer. This study also strongly advocates for the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination treatment of afatinib and ABCB1 substrate
chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, considering the
universality of ABCB1 substrate drugs and the increasing
use of afatinib in the clinic, the quantitative results of this
study also offer a theoretical basis for dosage adjustments
of ABCB1 substrate drugs during their combination
treatment with afatinib. Finally, this study can facilitate
the rediscovery of superior MDR reversal agents from
molecular targeted drugs to provide a more effective and
safer way of resensitizing MDR.

Mouse xenograft model

In vivo imaging assay

Athymic female nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu)
of 4~6 weeks old were used to establish the A2780T
xenograft model following the Declaration of Helsinki
and the guidelines from Southern Medical University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Briefly,
5 × 106 A2780T cells were suspended in 200 μl PBS and
inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of the nude
mice. When tumors reached a mean diameter of 0.6 cm,
the mice were randomized into four groups (9 in each
group) and received different treatments: (a) saline (q3d
× 6, intraperitoneally [i.p.]); (b) paclitaxel (18 mg/kg,
i.p., q3d × 6); (c) afatinib (70 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6); and
(d) paclitaxel (18 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6) plus afatinib (70
mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 6). Throughout the treatment, the mice
were weighed and their tumors were measured with a
caliper every 3 days. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated
using the formula: V = π/6 × larger diameter × (smaller
diameter)2. When tumors grew to a proper size, the mice
were euthanized and the tumors were excised, weighed
and stored at –80°C or 4% paraformaldehyde for further
examination. The ratio of growth inhibition (IR) was
calculated according to the following formula:

Athymic nude mice bearing A2780T cell xenografts
were established following the method described in the in
vivo xenograft model section. When tumors reached a mean
diameter of 1.5 cm, the mice were randomized into three
groups (3 in each group) and injected with different solutions
into the vein of the tail: (a) saline (400 μl); (b) rhodamine
123 (20 mg/kg, 400 μl); and (c) afatinib + rhodamine 123
(afatinib, 4 mg/kg; rhodamine 123, 20 mg/kg; 400 μl). 90
minutes after injection, the mice were anesthetized with
0.3% pentobarbital sodium, placed in a prone position on
a supporting cradle and moved into the scanner. Then,
the whole body scans of the mice under the fluorescence
transillumination model were collected by the In-Vivo
Imaging System (Kodak Carestream Health, Rochester, NY,

were centrifuged, washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in complete medium in the absence or presence
of different concentrations of afatinib. Then, the cells
were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. In the control
experiments, the same reactions were kept at 0°C. After
incubation, the cells were centrifuged, washed three times
with cold PBS and resuspended in 0.5 ml cold PBS for

×100%

Apoptosis assays
Cell apoptosis were measured by using the Dead
Cell Apoptosis Detection Kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Then, the apoptosis rates of cells were detected by flow
cytometry. TUNEL assay was performed using the

flow cytometric analysis. The quantity of the rhodamine
123 efflux by ABCB1 was calculated by subtracting the
values obtained at 37°C from the values obtained at 0°C.

hydrophobic center (HP), positive charge center (POS),
negative charge center (NEG), and aromatic ring (AR)
were selected. The number of each feature was set to range
from 0 to 5. The top ten pharmacophores were generated
with one being selected on the basis of the best match
between afatinib and the pharmacophore model.

ATPase activity assay of ABCB1
Effects of afatinib on the ATPase activity of ABCB1
were measured by using the P-gp-Glo™ Assay Systems
from Promega (Madison WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. A detailed description was
supplied in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Protein structure preparation and
docking simulation
The X-ray crystal structure of mouse ABCB1 (PDB
ID: 3G61), obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank,
was used as the template to build the homology model
of human ABCB1 [40]. The sequence alignment between
mouse ABCB1 and human ABCB1 (Supplementary
Figure S5) was performed to assist the model amendment
process. The initial homology model was constructed
in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2013)
and further optimized using AMBER 11 [47]. Various
validation methods, including PROCHECK, ERRAT and
PROSA were employed to evaluate the reliability of the
human ABCB1 model [48, 49]. The substrate binding
domain and the ATP binding domain were identified using
Site Finder module in MOE 2013. The 3D structure of
afatinib was built in MOE and energy minimized using
the CHARMM force field. Different protonation states of
afatinib with pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 and all
possible tautomers were generated. Each conformation
of afatinib was docked. Docking protocol in MOE was
employed to carry out the docking study.

RT-PCR and western blot
RT-PCR and western blot were performed
as described previously [42], and as detailed in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods section.
The sequences of specific PCR primers were
5′-TGGGGCTGGACTTCCTCTCATGATGC-3′ (forward)
and 5′-GCAGCAACCAGCACCCC AGCACCAAT-3′
(reverse) for MDR1; 5′-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCAT
TTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTC
TTC-3′ (reverse) for GAPDH.

Cell immunofluorescence
The nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65
was detected by cell immunofluorescence. Briefly, A2780T
cells were seeded on cover slips in 24-well plates and
induced with different treatments. Afterwards, the cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes,
washed three times with PBS and then permeabilized with
0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. Fixed cells were
saturated for 30 minutes in 5% BSA at room temperature.
Subsequently, cells were stained with the primary antibody
(p65, 1:200 dilution) overnight at 4°C, followed by an
incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with
CY3. DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei. Fluorescence
images were captured using a Fluoview FV10i confocal
microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA).

EGFR and ABCB1 mutational analysis
DNA was extracted from cells using the Tissue
DNA Kit (OMEGA; Norcross, GA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol [50]. PCR primers were
designed to amplify a 405-bp fragment encompassing the
sequence for exon 18 of EGFR gene, a 469-bp fragment
encompassing the sequence for exon 19 of EGFR gene, a
384-bp fragment encompassing the sequence for exon 20 of
EGFR gene, a 379-bp fragment encompassing the sequence
for exon 21 of EGFR gene, a 378-bp fragment of MDR1
gene encompassing the sequence for Gly533, Gly534,
Lys536 and Ala560 of ABCB1 protein, respectively. The
primers were listed below. DNA sequencing was performed
by an ABI 3730XL Auto-mated sequencer, using the ABI
Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit (Perkin Elmer, Branchburg, NJ).

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
were performed as described previously [46]. A detailed
description was supplied in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

To vertify the structural basis of afatinib as an
ABCB1 inhibitor, a novel pharmacophore of ABCB1
inhibitors was generated. Briefly, the common features
for afatinib, tariquidar, and zosuquidar were generated
with a pharmacophore protocol using the Discovery
Studio 3.5 [33, 34]. Six features including the hydrogen
bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD),
