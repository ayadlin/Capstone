ABSTRACT
Pterostilbene has been reported as a potential drug to inhibit oxidative stress and
inflammation. However, the effect of pterostilbene on chondrocytes and osteoarthritis
remains to be elucidated. We sought to investigate whether pterostilbene could
protect chondrocytes from inflammation and ROS production through factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. The pterostilbene toxicity on chondrocytes
collected from cartilages of Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed by CCK-8 test.
Immunofluorescence and Western blotting explored the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.
Nrf2 expression was silenced by siRNA to evaluate the involvement of Nrf2 in the effect
of pterostilbene on chondrocytes. Finally, osteoarthritis model was established by the
transection of anterior cruciate ligament and partial medial meniscectomy in rats, and
then these rats received pterostilbene 30 mg/kg, daily, p.o. for 8 weeks. Histology
and immunohistochemistry were used to assess histopathological change and Nrf2
expression in cartilage. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was stimulated by pterostilbene
without cellular toxicity. Pterostilbene inhibited the level of COX-2, iNOS, PGE2, and NO,
as well as the mitochondrial and total intracellular ROS production induced by IL-1β
in chondrocytes, partially reversed by the Nrf2 silencing. Pterostilbene prevented
cartilage degeneration and promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in cartilage.
These results suggest that pterostilbene could inhibit the IL-1β-induced inflammation
and ROS production in chondrocytes by stimulating the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

INTRODUCTION

chemokines, adipokines, and pro-inflammation cytokines
such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β
(IL-1β), IL-4, and IL-6 were increased in the serum
and OA cartilage [5, 6]. These cytokines stimulated
chondrocytes to secrete synthesize cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), leading to the
destruction of cartilages [7]. On the other hand, oxidative
stress has been regarded as another important etiology for
OA, which regulates the intracellular signaling processes,
chondrocyte senescence, apoptosis and autophagy, ECM
synthesis and degradation [2]. Importantly, reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production results in the proinflammatory
phenotypic alteration via the nuclear factor-kappa B

Osteoarthritis (OA), a most common joint disease,
causes the joint deformity and pain, contributing to work
disability and sick leave [1]. The erosion and destruction
of articular cartilage are the specific characteristics of
OA, accompanied by the loss of chondrocyte number and
function, as well as the degradation of extracellular matrix
(ECM). Recently, the focus on the mechanism and therapy
of OA has been shifted from structural to the molecular
changes such as inflammation and oxidative stress [2].
Several compelling pieces of evidences have
demonstrated the inflammation-associated changes in the
OA cartilage [3, 4]. Inflammatory mediators including

(NF-ĸB) pathway in OA chondrocytes [8, 9]. The wellacknowledged stimulator of inflammation and ROS
production [10], IL-1β, was used to mimic the condition
in the OA chondrocytes in the present study.
The main drugs against inflammation and pain in OA
are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
with some side effects and high economic burden [11].
However, a reliable and efficient drug for inhibiting ROS
remains to be explored. Pterostilbene (PTE), a natural
component of blueberry, is a phytoalexin and an analog
of resveratrol with higher bioavailability and convenience
[12, 13]. Some studies have reported the suppressive
effects of PTE on inflammation, oxidative stress, and
apoptosis in mammalian cells [14]. Under hyperosmotic
stress, PTE reduced the ROS production and the expression
of inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6,
TNF-α, metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 in
corneal epithelial cells [15]. The oxidative stress induced
by low-density lipoprotein in vascular endothelial cells
was also inhibited by PTE [16]. In addition, the protective
roles of PTE on anti-hyperlipidemia and carcinogenesis
have also been reported [17, 18]. However, the role of
PTE in chondrocytes and OA has never been investigated.
Therefore, we hypothesized that PTE could attenuate the
IL-1β-induced inflammation and ROS production.
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2) is a
basic leucine zipper transcription factor in an intracellular
adaptive mechanism against the hostile stimulations of
oxidative stress by managing the level of phase II detoxifying
enzymes andproteins [19]. Upon stimulation by oxidative
stress, the cytoplasmic Nrf2 enters into the nucleus and
promotes the transcription of antioxidant response element
(ARE)-dependent gene including the heme oxygenase 1
(HO1), NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1),
glutathione peroxidase (GPx), -glutamylcysteine synthetase
(γ-GCS), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)
[20]. The protective roles of Nrf2 in brain, heart, and liver have
been widely reported [21, 22]. Recently, the involvement of
Nrf2 in the protective role of PTE on the cell apoptosis and
oxidative stress has also been demonstrated [23]. However, the
association between Nrf2 and PTE has never been reported in
chondrocytes and OA. In the present study, we investigated
whether PTE could activate Nrf2 signaling and inhibit the
IL-1β-induced inflammation and ROS production, as well as
the effects in vivo. The OA model of SD rats were used in the
present study to investigate the role of PTE on the cartilage
degeneration and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in cartilages.

treated with 60 μM and 80 μM PTE showed decreased
viability (Figure 1A, P < 0.05). A significant difference
was not observed between 0–40 μM PTE-treated and
control chondrocytes. 20 μM PTE treatment for 0–36
hours did not decrease cell viability (Figure 1B, P < 0.05),
suggesting that the PTE treatment for less than 48 h
was not detrimental for rat chondrocytes. Therefore,
20 μM PTE treatment for 24 h was used in the following
experiments.
The activation of Nrf2 pathway in chondrocytes was
detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting.
In the control chondrocytes, the green fluorescence was
mainly found in the cytoplasm. However, the 10 and 20 μM
PTE markedly increased the intensity of green staining
in the nuclei (Figure 1C–1E), indicating the formation
of nuclear translocation. Western blotting detected a
similar finding. A dose-dependent change of the nuclearcytoplasmic distribution of Nrf2 protein was found in the
PTE-treated chondrocytes with a significant difference in
the 4, 10 and 20 μM PTE-treated cells compared with the
control cells (Figure 1F–1G), accompanied by the decrease
of cytoplasm protein and increase of the nuclear protein.
These results indicated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2
activated by the PTE.

The involvement of Nrf2 in the antiinflammation effect of PTE on IL-1β-treated
chondrocytes

RESULTS

RNAi against Nrf2 was utilized to analyze the
involvement of Nrf2 in the effect of PTE on IL-1β-induced
inflammation. Western blotting showed that the nuclear
Nrf2 expression was inhibited significantly in both the
control and PTE-treated chondrocytes after Nrf2 siRNA
transfection(Figure 2A–2B, P < 0.05). As anticipated, IL-1β
significantly increased the expression of COX-2 and
iNOS mRNA observed by real-time PCR(Figure 2C–2D,
P < 0.05). IL-1β significantly elevated the release of
NO and PGE-2 investigated by nitrite assay and ELISA
(Figure 2E–2F, P < 0.05). However, PTE could partly
attenuate the increase of these inflammatory mediators
in the IL-1β-treated chondrocytes (P < 0.05), indicating
the anti-inflammatory role of PTE. Compared to the cells
treated with IL-1β and PTE, Nrf2 inhibition could abolish
the inhibitory effect of PTE on the expression of COX-2
and iNOS mRNA and the release of NO and PGE-2 in
chondrocytes, suggesting that Nrf2 pathway might
mediate the protective role of PTE on chondrocytes under
inflammatory condition.

diacetate (DCFDA) staining for analyzing the production
of mitochondrial superoxide and intracellular ROS.
Unsurprisingly, IL-1β markedly enhanced the red
fluorescence density of MitoSOX-Red staining, which
was partially attenuated by the pre-treatment of PTE,
indicating the inhibitory effect of PTE on the generation
of mitochondrial superoxide (Figure 3A–3B, P < 0.05).
Conversely, Nrf2 silencing could reverse the inhibitory
role of PTE on the generation of mitochondrial superoxide,
indicating that Nrf2 was a potential mediator of the
protective effect (Figure 3A–3B). Similar to the result of
MitoSOX-Red staining, PTE inhibited the production of
total intracellular ROS induced by the IL-1β demonstrated
by DCFDA staining (Figure 3C). Also, the Nrf2 siRNA
transfection increased the intensity of DCFDA staining,

suggesting the involvement of Nrf2 in the effect of PTE
on total intracellular ROS production.

Effect of PTE on osteoarthritis in knee cartilages
of SD rats
During the surgery and experiment, all the rats
were healthy without anesthetic accident, weight loss,
and infection. In order to confirm the effect of PTE on
the cartilage degeneration and the nuclear-cytoplasmic
distribution of Nrf2 protein in cartilages, SD rats with
osteoarthritis were treated with PTE for 8 weeks. Compared
with the OA cartilage, the PTE-treated OA cartilage showed
more smooth, more deposit of proteoglycan in ECM and
less formation of fibrillations demonstrated by the HE

and Safranin O/Fast Green staining (Figure 4A–4L).
Additionally, cell cluster formation and cell density
decline could be found in the OA cartilage of ACLX group
(Figure 4A–4L). The OARSI score analysis showed that
the damage and degeneration of cartilage in medial tibia

was most severe, compared with that in medial femur,
lateral femur and lateral tibia (Figure 4M–4P). Importantly,
PTE could significantly reduced the severity of cartilage
degeneration in the four quadrants of OA cartilages
(Figure 4M–4P).

role of PTE on the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in vivo. In
the OA cartilages, the Nrf2 protein was mainly distributed
in the cytoplasm (Figure 5D–5F), and the normal cartilage
showed less Nrf2 expression in both the cytoplasm and
nucleus (Figure 5A–5C). In order to analyze the percentage
of Nrf2-positive cells in nuclei, three pictures were taken

inhibit inflammation and ROS production by activating
Nrf2 signaling and the following pathways. Finally, we
showed that PTE could prevent the cartilage degeneration
and promote the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the OA
articular cartilage, further demonstrating the protective role
of PTE on OA in vivo. However, the symptomatic recovery
in rats has not been described due to the difficult to obtain
the data about the symptom.
First, the cytotoxicity of PTE on chondrocytes was
checked, and we found that 20 μM PTE with 24 h treatment
was not detrimental to the chondrocyte viability. In a
previous study, PTE had no cytotoxic effects on the murine
macrophages at doses of 1–100 μM with 24 h treatment
[24]. However, when the treatment time was extended to
72 h, PTE was found to inhibit the cell viability at a dosage
above 30 μM [24].
IL-1β has been regarded as a classic pro-inflammatory
and pro-catabolic factor in chondrocytes, contributing to
the degradation of ECM [25, 26]. The present study also

DISCUSSION
Recently, PTE has been regarded a promising drug
to alleviate the cartilage degeneration which is considered
as an inflammatory disease. Because the protective role
of blueberry on OA has been extensively studied, it is not
surprising that PTE could inhibit the inflammation and
ROS production in chondrocytes induced by IL-1β. The
production of inflammatory mediators including COX-2,
iNOS, PGE2, and NO, as well as the mitochondrial
and intracellular ROS, was significantly inhibited by
PTE. However, Nrf2 silencing could partly abolish the
benefits in chondrocytes, suggesting that PTE might

showed that IL-1β increased the expression of COX-2,
PGE2, and iNOS which was an enzyme producing NO.
COX-2 and PGE2 are the primary mediators of osteoarthritis
pain induced by inflammation [26]. The in vitro studies
demonstrated that PTE could inhibit the expression
of these inflammatory mediators induced by IL-1β,
suggesting it as a candidate to relieve the pain symptom of
OA. However, PTE could to some extent increase the COX-2
and iNOS expression compared with the control group,
suggesting that PTE alone could also activate the low-level
inflammation in chondrocytes.
The inflammation and ROS production are initiated
in the OA cartilage. Compared with the low level of ROS
in normal cartilage, the ROS production was significantly

elevated in the OA cartilage [27]. ROS production leads
to the imbalance of ECM production, cell senescence,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, as well as
DNA damage [2]. In the present study, IL-1β increased
the production of the total intracellular and mitochondrial
ROS, further confirming the induction of mitochondrial
dysfunction by IL-1β [10] and suggesting mitochondria
as the primary source of ROS production. However,
these ROS production induced by IL-1β was inhibited by
PTE. Given the contribution of ROS and inflammation
to the degradation in cartilage [28], the inhibition of
inflammation and ROS production might mediate the
protective role of PTE on cartilage degeneration in the rat
model of OA.

Although the mechanisms mediating the protective
role of PTE included several signaling pathways such
as the regulation of Sirt1, extracellular regulated kinase
(ERK) and NF-ĸB pathways [29], the activation of Nrf2
pathway was still considered as a promising approach. The
nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of Nrf2 protein altered
by the PTE was found in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating
the stimulatory role of PTE on the nuclear translocation.
Furthermore, the involvement of Nrf2 in the protective
effect of PTE on cartilage degeneration was also proved.
As a self-adaptive mechanism in cells, Nrf2 expression
was changed in numerous diseases with inflammation and
oxidative stress. A significant decrease in nuclear Nrf2
expression was observed in the affected brain regions of
Alzheimer disease (AD) and liver of SAMP8 mice with a
systemic accumulation of oxidative stress [30, 31]. In the
present study, the nuclear Nrf2 protein was not increased
in the OA cartilage compared with the normal cartilage,
suggesting the inactivation of Nrf2-mediated transcription
against oxidative stress and inflammation in OA cartilage.
Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 binds to
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), therefore,
the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 is the first step of
Nrf2 nuclear translocation [32]. Ramkumar et al. [32]
found that PTE could disturb the Nrf-Keap1 interaction
and promote the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the
human embryonic kidney cells. Similarly, our finding
further validated the finding in chondrocytes. After
entering into the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to the ARE and forms
the heterodimers with the transcription factors c-Jun and
small Maf proteins (G/F/K), stimulating the transcription
of antioxidant genes and combating with not only the
products of oxidation, but also the oxygen radicals [20].
In conclusion, these results indicate that PTE
stimulates the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and inhibits
inflammation and ROS production in the IL-1β-induced
chondrocytes. The activation of Nrf2 pathway promotes
the transcription of antioxidant genes and inhibits ROS
production, as well as the inflammation. PTE could
prevent the cartilage degeneration and activate Nrf2 in the
OA cartilage.

The secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry
and Western blotting, DAPI, cytoplasmic and nuclear
protein extraction reagents, DCFDA assay kits were from
Beyotime (Shanghai, China). The cell culture reagents
including Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM),
fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 0.25% trypsin were bought
from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK-8) was obtained from Dojindo (Tokyo, Japan).

Rat chondrocyte culture
The chondrocyte extraction and culture were carried
out according to the previous reports [33]. 5 male 250–300 g
SD rats (2.5 months old) were euthanized by CO2
inhalation. The bilateral cartilages of knee joints were totally
resected, followed by cutting with Micro scissors, digestion
with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 30 min and collagenase II for
4 h. The cell aggregates after digestion and washing were
filtrated through 150-µM mesh, then high-glucose (4.5 g/L)
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
were used to culture chondrocytes in an incubator with
5% CO2 at 37°C. In order to eliminate the influence of dedifferentiation in chondrocytes, the second passage cells
were used in the downstream experiments.

Experimental design
Primary rat chondrocytes were isolated six times,
and the following experiments were repeated six times
using the isolated chondrocytes each time. First, the
cellular toxicity of PTE was examined by CCK-8 assay.
Then the effect of PTE on Nrf2 activation was explored,
followed by the investigation of its protective role
against inflammatory and ROS production, as well as the
involvement of Nrf2. 10 ng/mL IL-1β was used to promote
inflammation and ROS production in the chondrocytes.
PTE were added to the medium 2 h prior to the IL-1β.
RNAi was used for the silence of Nrf2. 48 h post
transfection, the PTE and IL-1β were added successively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The experimental protocols for animals were
approved by Wenzhou Medical University Animal Care

2 × 104 chondrocytes cultured in 48-well plate were
treated with 10 and 20 μM PTE for 24 h. The chondrocytes
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C.
Subsequently, the cellular membrane was permeabilized
with 0.2%Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 5%
BSA for 30 min. The chondrocytes were incubated with
the Nrf2 primary antibody (1:100) at 4°C for 12–16 h,
followed by incubation with FITC conjugated secondary
antibodies. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
Finally, the chondrocytes were observed under a confocal
microscope (Leica TCS SP8,Germany).

2 × SYBR Premix Ex Taq mixture, 0.2 μmol/L of each
primer and sterile distilled water. The 8-strip PCR tubes
and placed in a LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
for detection. The thermocycler parameters were 50°C for
2 min, 95°C for 30s, 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s, and 60°C
for 34 s [35]. DNA contamination was evaluated using
a non-template control. The primers of COX-2, iNOS,
and GAPDH of rats were shown in Table 2. After the
reaction, the cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained and
normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The
relative mRNA levels of each target gene were calculated
by the 2–ΔΔCt method.

Western blotting

Nitrite measurement

The nuclear and cytoplasmic protein from the
chondrocytes was isolated as recommended by the
manufacturer using the extraction kits (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China). The nuclear and cytoplasmic protein
concentration was determined using an Enhanced BCA
Protein Assay Kit. The total protein was resolved on sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto the polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane (BIO-RAD USA). After blocking with
5% nonfat milk for 2 h, the membrane was incubated with
the Nrf2 primary antibody (1:1000) and HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies. ECL Plus reagent was used to expose
the membrane in an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (PerkinElmer, USA). Semi-quantitative analysis of
band intensity was analyzed byAlphaEaseFC 4.0 software.

The nitrite level in the supernatant of the medium
was assessed by the classic Griess method [36]. After
treatments, Griess reagents I and II were added to the
supernatant to the 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C
for 3 min. Absorbance was measured with the microplate
reader at 540 nm, and the nitrite concentration calculated
from the standard curve.

Nrf2 siRNA transfection

MitoSOX red staining for mitochondrial ROS

The sequences of small interfering RNAs (siRNA),
shown in Table 1 were designed as previously described
[33, 34] and synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai,
China). Cells were cultured in a 6-well tissue culture
plate (2 × 105 cells/well). siRNA was delivered into
chondrocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h posttransfection, the infected cells were treated as described
in the experimental design. The non-specific non-targeting
siRNA (scrambled) was used as a control. Western blotting
consequently examined the inhibitory efficiency of specific
silencing using the nuclear extracts.

MitoSOX Red is a novel dye targeting the
mitochondria and emitting red fluorescence when oxidized
by the mitochondrial Superoxide Anion (O2-). First, 50μg
MitoSOX dye dissolved in 13 μL DMSO was added into a
serum-free medium for a 5 mM stock concentration. 5 × 104
chondrocytes cultured in glass dishes were incubated
with the 1 mL 5 μM working solution for 15 min at 37°C,
followed by DAPI staining for 5 min at 37°C. After
washing with PBS three times, the cells cultured in fresh
DMEM were observed under the confocal microscope
(Leica TCS SP8,Germany).

ELISA assay
After treatment with PTE and IL-1β for 24 h, the
culture supernatants were obtained. The concentration
of PGE-2 was measured by ELISA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sensitivity of PGE-2
ELISA assay was 13.4pg/mL.

DCFDA assay for intracellular ROS

Real-time PCR

DCFDA assay is a classic method for analyzing
the intracellular level of hydroxyl, peroxyl, and other
ROS, performed according to a previous report [37].
After treatments as described in the experimental design,
chondrocytes in 96-well plates were incubated with 10 μM
DCFDA in the serum-free medium at 37°C for 20 min.
Subsequently, chondrocyte suspensions were obtained by
harvesting with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and centrifugation.

After treatments as the experimental design
described, the total RNA of chondrocytes was extracted
using TRIzol reagent, followed by the synthesis of
cNDA using 1µg total RNA. The RNA was quantified
with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND-1000; Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, DE) by controlling the range of
ratio OD 260/280 between 1.8 and 2.0. The RT-PCR 20 μL

serial sectioning. The sections were HE stained to assess
the destruction of cartilage. In order to investigate
the matrix proteoglycans expression, Safranin O/Fast
Green staining was performed on the sections. Cartilage
degradation was quantified using the Osteoarthritis
Research Society International (OARSI) cartilage grading
system [39]. Three independent and blinded observers who
were not aware of the treatment procedures received by
each joint scored each section, and the scores for all of the
sections cut from the medial femur, lateral femur, medial
tibia and lateral tibia in 6 rats were averaged respectively.
In each quadrant, at least 3 sections were scored, and the
scores were averaged within groups. The higher score
indicates the more cartilage degeneration.

Establishment and treatment of an OA model of
knee joints in SD rats
The osteoarthritis Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model
was established as previously described [38]. Briefly,
18 male 200–300 g SD (2 months old) rats in the
conventional housing were anesthetized by the10% (w/v)
chloral hydrate (0.2 mL/100 g) by intraperitoneal injection
and randomly divided into 3 groups including normal,
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection and partial
medial meniscectomy (ACLX), and ACLX+PTE groups.
The surgeries were performed on the right knee joints.
After exposing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and
medial meniscus via the medial approach, the ACL was
transected, and the partial meniscus was resected (ACLX).
The rats in the ACLX, and ACLX+PTE groups received
the above surgery. The rats in the normal group underwent
the same incision and exposure without the resection of
ACL and meniscus. Subsequent to the surgery, all the
animals were administered solvent agent-sunflower oil, and
the rats in the ACLX+PTE group received the 30 mg/kg
PTE, daily, p.o. in sunflower oil for 8 weeks. 8 weeks after
the surgery, 6 rats in every group were euthanized for the
histological analysis and immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry
The above sections were used to perform the
immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinization and
graded rehydration, the endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. The antigen was
retrieved by the conventional heat method, followed by
blocking with 5% BSA and permeabilization with 1%
Tween-20 in PBS for 30 min. The sections were incubated
with the primary antibodies against Nrf2 (1:200) and PBS
as negative controls for 12–16 h at 4°C, followed by HRPconjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Finally, the sections were microscopically
examined. To assure the accuracy, three sections from the
6 knee joints were utilized to observe the expression of Nrf2
in the articular cartilage. In order to analyze the percentage
of cells with positive Nrf2 in nuclei, three pictures were
taken under 40× magnification in cartilage sections from
knees joints, representing the centre, medial and lateral tibial
surface. The number of cells with brown staining in the
nuclei and the total cell number in each section was counted.

Histological assessment
The whole knee joints of each rat were fixed in
10% neutral formalin and decalciﬁed with10% EDTA
for 2 months, and then parafﬁn-embedded for midsagittal
