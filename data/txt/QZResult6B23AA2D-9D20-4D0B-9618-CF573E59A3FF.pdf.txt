ABSTRACT
Aberrant activation of β-catenin/TCF signaling is related to the invasiveness
of pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of capsaicin on
β-catenin/TCF signaling. In a concentration and time-dependent study, we observed
that capsaicin treatment inhibits the activation of dishevelled (Dsh) protein DvI-1
in L3.6PL, PanC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Capsaicin treatment
induced GSK-3β by inhibiting its phosphorylation and further activated APC and Axin
multicomplex, leading to the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Expression of TCF1 and β-catenin-responsive proteins, c-Myc and cyclin D1 also decreased in response
to capsaicin treatment. Pre-treatment of cells with MG-132 blocked capsaicinmediated proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. To establish the involvement of
β-catenin in capsaicin-induced apoptosis, cells were treated with LiCl or SB415286,
inhibitors of GSK-3β. Our results reveal that capsaicin treatment suppressed LiCl or
SB415286-mediated activation of β-catenin signaling. Our results further showed that
capsaicin blocked nuclear translocation of β-catenin, TCF-1 and p-STAT-3 (Tyr705).
The immunoprecipitation results indicated that capsaicin treatment reduced the
interaction of β-catenin and TCF-1 in the nucleus. Moreover, capsaicin treatment
significantly decreased the phosphorylation of STAT-3 at Tyr705. Interestingly, STAT3 over expression or STAT-3 activation by IL-6, significantly increased the levels of
β-catenin and attenuated the effects of capsaicin in inhibiting β-catenin signaling.
Finally, capsaicin mediated inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth was associated
with inhibition of β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that
capsaicin-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells was associated with inhibition
of β-catenin signaling due to the dissociation of β-catenin/TCF-1 complex and the
process was orchestrated by STAT-3.

pancreatic cancer is less than 5% [1]. Most of the treatment
failures in the clinic are due to the development of resistance
to systemic therapy. Therefore, development of novel agents,
which can prevent and treat pancreatic cancer is an important
mission. β-catenin and other proteins including axin and
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in the Wnt signaling

pathway play an important role in many types of human
cancers, including pancreatic cancer [2–4]. Mutation of
β-catenin/APC or aberrant activation of Wnt and β-catenin
signaling have been reported in pancreatoblastomas [5, 6],
acinar cell carcinoma [7], pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
[3, 8, 9] and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN)
[10–13]. In the presence of Wnt inhibitor, β-catenin is
targeted for degradation through phosphorylation of
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which forms
complexes with APC and Axin. However, when Wnt or
Frizzled are up-regulated, this complex is inhibited and
β-catenin is phosphorylated resulting in its accumulation in
the cytoplasm and subsequent nuclear translocation. After
nuclear translocation, β-catenin is stabilized and binds to
TCF/LEF transcriptional co-activators, resulting in the
up-regulation of transcription responsive genes cyclin D1
and c-Myc. Through regulating target gene expression,
β-catenin/TCF signaling is involved in sequential neoplastic
development from initiation, progression to metastasis
[5, 14–16]. Published studies suggest that inhibition of
β-catenin decreases TCF transcriptional activity and induces
caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [17].
Signal transducer and activator of transcriptional
3 is a member of STAT family present in cytoplasm.
Phosphorylated STAT-3s dimerize and translocate to the
nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes
and modulate various physiological functions, including
cell cycle regulation, cell survival and angiogenesis
[18, 19]. Interestingly, recently published papers suggest
that STAT-3 activation might participate in β-catenin
nuclear accumulation in colorectal cancer [20].
Capsaicin is a major component of hot chili pepper.
Several studies have shown significant chemopreventive
and chemotherapeutic effects of capsaicin against certain
mutagens and carcinogens [21–26]. Capsaicin has also
shown effectiveness in preventing several types of cancer
through various mechanisms [27–31]. In the present study,
we evaluated the effect of capsaicin in β-catenin and TCF1 signaling and a possible link to STAT-3.

APC, and Axin protein levels (Figure 1A, 1B & 1C). These
results suggest that capsaicin treatment inhibits the Frizzled
receptor, inactivates DSH, resulting in increased APC/Axin/
GSK-3β complex formation, leading to the prevention of
β-catenin stabilization and activation of β-catenin/TCF-1
mediated transcriptional responsive genes. Further, cleavage
of caspase-3 was observed by capsaicin treatment indicating
apoptosis. In a time-dependent study, β-catenin levels began
decreasing after 4 h of capsaicin treatment concomitant with
the increase in APC and Axin levels, indicating that capsaicin
mediated inhibition of cytosolic β-catenin increased APC,
Axin and GSK-3β complex. Capsaicin treatment also
decreased TCF-1 at 16 h and CyclinD1 at 2 h (Figure 1D).
However cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was observed
only at 16 h as described in our previous study [32]. Overall,
these results suggest that capsaicin-induced apoptosis was
associated with the inhibition β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling.

Capsaicin treatment inhibits nuclear localization
of β-catenin, TCF-1 and p-STAT-3(Tyr 705)
β-catenin upon translocation to the nucleus associates
with transcription factor TCF and activates β-catenin/TCF-1
complex leading to the transcription of downstream
gene such as c-Myc and cyclin D1, hence increase in
cell proliferation. Since we observed decrease in c-Myc
and cyclinD1 expression by capsaicin treatment, we next
wanted to see β-catenin and TCF-1 protein levels in the
nucleus. Our results show that β-catenin and TCF-1 levels
decreased significantly in the nuclear fraction of capsaicin
treated PanC-1 and L3.6PL cells (Figure 2A & 2B).
STAT-3 upon phosphorylation dimerizes and translocates
to nucleus to transcribe cell survival genes. Our results
clearly demonstrate that capsaicin treatment blocks
nuclear entry of p-STAT-3 (Tyr705) in both the cell lines
(Figure 2A & 2B). Nuclear localization of β-catenin and
TCF-1 were further confirmed by immunofluorescence.
Capsaicin treatment decreased immuno-staining of
β-catenin and TCF-1 in the nucleus (Figure 2C), suggesting
that capsaicin treatment inhibits nuclear translocation
of β-catenin and thereby inhibits β-catenin and TCF-1
mediated transcription of responsive genes.

Our results revealed that capsaicin treatment decreased
the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at S9 and STAT-3 at Y705
and increased the phosphorylation of β-catenin at S33/37/
T41 (Figure 1A, 1B & 1C). Capsaicin treatment further
reduced the protein levels of Frizzled, DVI-1, β-catenin,
TCF-1, c-Myc and Cyclin D1, while increased GSK-3β,

capsaicin treatment decreased TCF-1 levels when
immunoprecipitated with TCF-1 or β-catenin antibodies,
indicating capsaicin treatment disrupts association of
β-catenin/TCF-1complex in the nucleus (Figure 3A & 3B).

Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibits APC/
Axin/GSk-3β complex, which prevents phosphorylation of
β-catenin leading to its translocation and accumulation in
the nucleus. We therefore wanted to see whether GSK3β inhibitor LiCl or SB415286 could block capsaicin
mediated inhibition of β-catenin signaling. To do so,
PanC-1 cells were pretreated with LiCl or SB415286 for
1 h, followed by 75 μM capsaicin treatment for 24 h. As
expected, LiCl and SB415286 activated β-catenin/TCF-1
signaling by increasing β-catenin, p-GSK-3β and TCF-1
levels (Figure 4C & 4D). However, these effects were

which in turn increased the expression of downstream
molecules such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc in PanC-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells (Figure 4A & 4B), suggesting that

treatment suppressed these effects (Figure 5C). To further
confirm this phenomenon, cells were pretreated with

we orthotopically implanted Panc1-Luc pancreatic tumor
cells in athymic nude mice [32]. After three week of tumor
cell implantation, animals were fed 5 mg/kg capsaicin
every day by oral gavage. Non-invasive imaging of mice
revealed that capsaicin treatment substantially suppressed
the growth of pancreatic tumors as shown in Figure 6A

of capsaicin were associated with inhibition of β-catenin,

and subjected to immunofluorescence (Figure 6B). Our
results revealed that tumors from capsaicin treated mice
exhibited decreased red staining for β-catenin, TCF-1 and
p-STAT-3 (Tyr 705), indicating that capsaicin treatment
inhibits β-catenin, TCF-1 and p-STAT-3 (Tyr 705) in vivo.

growth suppression was associated with inhibition of
β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling, tumors from control and
capsaicin-treated mice were subjected to western blotting.
Our results demonstrate that capsaicin treatment inhibited
β-catenin, TCF-1, p-STAT-3, survivin and c-Myc levels
whereas increased cleavage of caspase-3 in the tumors of
capsaicin treated mice as compared to controls (Figure 6C).
These results clearly indicate that tumor growth suppression
by capsaicin was indeed associated with the inhibition of
β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling in vivo (Figure 6C).

TCF-1/β-catenin mediated downstream target genes such
as c-Myc, cyclin D1 [36–40]. Another study reported that
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) inhibit
TCF-1/β-catenin mediated downstream target genes such
as cyclin D1 and thereby inhibits growth of colorectal
cancer cells [41]. Our results validated such reports as
capsaicin mediated inhibition of β-catenin and TCF-1
signal further inhibited c-Myc and cyclin D1, leading
to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Recent studies
on structural elucidation of β-catenin/TCF complexes
highlight the possibility of developing cancer drugs that
may disrupt this typically large hydrophobic interface of
interacting proteins. A modest disruption of the binding
equilibrium could establish value in treating cancer
or other diseases [42–44]. Our present study indicates
that capsaicin disrupts the interaction of β-catenin/
TCF complex in the nucleus of pancreatic cancer cells
and thereby suppresses β-catenin/TCF mediated cell
proliferative genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D1.
Mutation in the multiple components of Wnt
pathway including APC, Axin and β-catenin can result
in increased levels of β-catenin [5, 16, 45, 46]. This may
be due to mutational changes in GSK-3β phosphorylation
site, preventing β-catenin phosphorylation and its
proteosomal degration. Capsaicin treatment in the current
study increased β-catenin degradation and enhanced
its proteasomal degradation. Recent findings reported
that lithium chloride and SB415286, a Wnt signaling
activation mimic inhibits GSK-3β, which functions in the
degradation of free β-catenin [47, 48]. Activation of Wnt
signaling stabilizes cytosolic β-catenin, which translocate
to the nucleus, stimulates TCF/LEF transcription factor
protein and target transcription responsive genes such
as cyclin D1 and c-Myc to promote cell proliferation
[49, 50]. Our study demonstrated that capsaicin treatment
also inhibits β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling activated by
lithium chloride or SB415286.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT-3) is as a member of the STAT family which
participates in normal cellular responses as transcription
factor [50]. Several previous studies reported that STAT-3 is
a target of β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling [51, 52]. Interestingly
few other studies also reported that activated STAT-3 was
involved in β-catenin nuclear accumulation in human
colorectal tumors [20]. Our current and previous study
indicated that STAT-3 is up regulated in pancreatic cancer
cells [53]. We found that capsaicin treatment decreased
the translocation of β-catenin, TCF-1 and phosphorylation
of STAT-3 (Tyr 705) in the nucleus. Our present findings
also showed that STAT-3 over-expression increased
β-catenin, TCF-1 and further downstream molecules cylin
D1 and c-Myc levels, which were inhibited by capsaicin
treatment. Our results are in agreement with the studies,
which suggest that STAT-3 regulates β-catenin/TCF-1
signaling to promote pancreatic tumor progression. As a
proof-of-concept, oral administration of 5 mg/kg capsaicin

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of
cancer-related deaths worldwide, therefore, an effective
treatment approach is required for controlling this
malignancy. We have previously demonstrated that
capsaicin-mediated inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells
was associated with ROS generation and dissociation of
ASK1 and Trx-1complex [32, 33]. β-catenin and other
components of Wnt signaling have been found to play
an important role in human cancers and that aberrant
activation of this signaling pathway was observed in
pancreatic tumors [2–4]. Direct targeting of β-catenin
and its functional partners (LEF/TCF proteins) by
chemo preventive agents attracted attention in cancer
therapeutics [34]. In the present study, we investigated
a novel mechanism by which capsaicin inhibits the
proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Our current
results demonstrated that capsaicin treatment inhibits
β-catenin-TCF-1 signaling, thereby decrease downstream
transcriptional responsive genes cyclinD1 and c-Myc,
which act to promote cell cycle and cell proliferation.
Cleavage of caspase-3 was also observed after capsaicin
treatment indicating occurrence of apoptosis. Our results
further revealed that capsaicin treatment inhibits nuclear
localization of β-catenin and TCF-1 and therefore disrupts
nuclear β-catenin/TCF-1 complex, which is important for
the transcription of cell survival genes. Our results also
demonstrated that STAT-3 orchestrates β-catenin-TCF-1
signaling, which is inhibited by capsaicin. In addition,
capsaicin mediated pancreatic tumor growth suppression
was associated with the inhibition of β-catenin-TCF-1
signaling in vivo, consistent with our in vitro data.
Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition
of oncogene β-catenin by small molecules prevents the
growth of esophageal and colon carcinoma cells [17,
35]. In agreement, our current study also showed that
capsaicin treatment inhibits the activation of dishevelled
family protein DvI-1. This in turn activated APC/Axin/
GSK-3β complex, increased the phosphorylation of
β-catenin, and inhibited TCF-1/β-catenin mediated
transcription of responsive genes such as c-Myc and
Cyclin D1. Recent studies also concluded that activated
Wnt signaling inactivates GSK-3β activity, leading to
accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin and induction of

athymic nude mice [32]. Tumors from capsaicin treated
mice showed decreased β-catenin, TCF-1 and p-STAT-3
levels as evaluated by immunofluorescence and western
blotting. Capsaicin treated tumors also showed cleavage of
caspase-3 indicating apoptosis. The mechanism of action
of capsaicin targeting β-catenin signaling is shown in
Figure 7. Overall our results demonstrated that capsaicin
mediated inhibition of β-catenin/TCF-1 signaling results in
apoptosis which was orchestrated by STAT-3 in pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

pre-incubated respective medium was added to the cuvette
and samples were transferred into the 6well plate for

were treated with either 10 μM MG132, 20 μM AG-490,
40 mM LiCl or 50 μM SB415286 for 1 h or with 20 ng/
ml IL-6 for 15min, followed by treatment with 75 μM
capsaicin for 24 h. Cell lysate were prepared for western

SB415286 were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
The antibodies against Cl-caspase-3, Frizzled, DVI-1,
p-β-Catenin (S33/37/T41), β-Catenin, p-GSK-3β (S9),
GSK-3β, APC, Axin, p-STAT-3 (Tyr 705), STAT-3,
TCF-1, c-Myc, Cyclin D1 were purchased from Cell
Signaling (Danvers, MA). Lamin B was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (CA). Alexa fluor
488 (green), alexa fluor 594 (red) conjugated goatanti-rabbit secondary antibody and DAPI were obtained
from Invitrogen. MG-132 was procured from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA). AG-490, a specific inhibitor of STAT-3
was purchased from Sellack Chemicals LLC.

To examine the effect of capsaicin on the
nuclear interaction of β-catenin with TCF-1 protein,
immunoprecipitaion assay was performed as described
by us previously [32]. Briefly, PanC-1 cells were treated
with DMSO or 75 μM capsaicin for 24 h, nuclear fraction
was separated using a nuclear fractionation kit and
immunoprecipitated with β-catenin or TCF-1 antibodies.
Samples were immunobloted with β-catenin or TCF-1
antibodies.

Immunofluorescence assay in cells and tumor
section
Immunofluorescence assay was performed as
described by us previously [54]. Briefly, PanC-1 cells
were plated on coverslips and allowed to attach overnight
and then treated with 75 μM of capsaicin for 24 h. On the
other hand, at the end of the orthotopic experiment, tumors
from control and capsaicin treated mice were dissected
out. About 10 μm tumor sections were immediately
sliced, placed on glass slides and kept frozen at –80°C for
24 h. Treated and untreated cells and tumor sections were
fixed with acetone:methanol (1:1) mixture and blocked
with goat-serum for 1 h and incubated with β-catenin,
TCF-1 and p-STAT-3(Tyr705) antibodies overnight at
4°C. Immunofluoresence was detected by anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated with alexa fluor
594 (Invitrogen) (red), alexa fluor 488 (green) and DAPI
(blue). After four washings, coverslips were mounted
with antifade mounting reagents. Nuclei were stained
with DAPI and the immmunofluoresence was observed
by a fluorescence microscope using oil immersion at 60X
magnification.

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines PanC-1, L3.6PL
and MiaPaCa-2 were obtained from ATCC (Rockville,
MD). Monolayer cultures of PanC-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells
were maintained in DMEM medium and L3.6PL was
maintained in MEM medium, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, PSN antibiotic mixture (10 ml/l), 2
mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate
and 20% glucose. All the cultures were maintained at 37°C
in a humidified chamber of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cell lines
were verified by STR analysis at TTUHSC core facilities
(Lubbock, TX). All the three cell lines have mutant KRAS
and TP53. Panc-1 has homozygous deletions in CDKN2A
and p16 genes and wild type SMAD4. MiaPaCa-2 has

Transient transfection
PanC-1 cells were transiently transfected with
STAT-3 plasmid using Nucleofector transfection reagent
(Lonza, Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacture
instruction. Briefly 1 × 106 PanC-1 cells were collected
and suspended in 100 μl of nucleofection solution per
sample and then combined with 2 μg STAT-3 DNA. Once
the electroporator program was completed, 500 μl of­

In vivo orthotopic experiment
Pancreatic orthotopic implantation in nude mice
was performed previously, and the tumors from control
and capsaicin treated mice were used in this study [32].
All animal experiments proceeded according to the

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Briefly, 4–6 week old female athymic nude mice were
anesthetized and a small incision was made to implant
stably luciferase-expressing 1 × 106 PanC-1 (PanC-1-luc)
cells into the sub-capsular region on the pancreas. Skin
incisions were then closed. On the very next day of
surgery, animals were imaged for basal luminescence
using IVIS Bio Luminescent System equipped with
Living Image software (Caliper LifeSciences, MA) after
injecting luciferin (3 mg/mouse). Twenty-one days after

the surgical implantation of PanC-1-luc cells, mice were
randomly divided into two groups with 5mice in each
group. Group I served as controls and received 0.1 ml
vehicle every day by oral gavage. Group II received
5 mg capsaicin/kg of body weight every day by oral
gavage. Tumor luminescence and animal weight was
measured thrice a week for seven weeks. At the end of
the experiment (day 70), mice were sacrificed; tumors
and pancreas were excised from each mouse, weighed
and snap frozen.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cells were exposed to various concentrations of
capsaicin for different time points and lysed on ice as
described by us previously [32, 53]. Whole-cell extracts
were also prepared as mentioned above. The tumors
from control and capsaicin treated mice were minced
and lysed by the described procedure [32]. The cell
lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 g
for 30 min. Cell lysate containing 10–80 μg protein
was resolved by 6–12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the
proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk
in Tris buffered saline, the membrane was incubated
with desired primary antibody (1:1000 dilutions)
overnight. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated
with appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000 dilutions)
and antibody binding was detected by using enhanced
chemiluminescence kit, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each membrane was stripped and re-probed
with antibody against actin (1:20000 dilutions) to ensure
equal protein loading.
