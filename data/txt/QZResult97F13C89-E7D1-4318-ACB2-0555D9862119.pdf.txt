Abstract
The chromosome 11q13.5 locus is frequently amplified in
several types of human cancer. We have previously shown that
11q13.5 amplification was associated with significantly
shorter overall survival in ovarian cancer patients, but the
molecular mechanisms of how amplification of this locus
contributes to disease aggressiveness remain unclear. Because
ovarian cancer mortality is primarily related to resistance of
chemotherapeutic agents, we screened the top six candidate
genes within this amplicon for their contribution to drug
resistance. Rsf-1 (also known as HBXAP) was found to be the
only gene in which gene knockdown sensitized tumor cells to
paclitaxel. Rsf-1 has been known to interact with hSNF2H to
form an ISWI chromatin remodeling complex. We found that
Rsf-1 was up-regulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer
cell lines, and Rsf-1 immunoreactivity in primary ovarian
carcinoma tissues correlated with in vitro paclitaxel resistance. Ectopic expression of Rsf-1 significantly enhanced
paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Down-regulation
of hSNF2H or disruption of hSNF2H and Rsf-1 interaction
enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity in tumor cells with Rsf-1 upregulation. Rsf-1 expression altered expression in several
genes and activated certain signaling pathways that may
contribute to drug resistance. In conclusion, our results
suggest that Rsf-1 is the major gene within the 11q13.5
amplicon that contributes to paclitaxel resistance, and the
formation of the Rsf-1/hSNF2H complex is required for
inducing this phenotype. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1407–15]

Introduction
Gene amplification is a common mechanism underlying
oncogenic activation in human cancer (1, 2). Amplification of
MYC family genes, EGFR, ERBB2 (Her2/neu), CCND1 (cyclin D1),
CCNE (cyclin E), and FGFR , has been reported in a variety of
human neoplastic diseases. Amplifications in several of the
oncogenes are associated with worse clinical outcome and are
amenable to specific targeted therapy (3). In an effort to identify
amplified chromosomal regions that may harbor novel cancerassociated genes, we have applied both digital karyotyping (4) and
single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (5) to analyze DNA copy
number alterations in purified high-grade ovarian serous carcinoNote: Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online

ma, one of the most aggressive type of neoplastic diseases in
women. Based on previous studies (6, 7), we found that the most
common amplicons in high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas were
those harboring CCNE (cyclin E1), Notch3, AKT2, and a discrete
chromosomal region at 11q13.5 that contained several cancerassociated genes including p21/cdc42/Rad-activated kinase (PAK1;
refs. 8, 9), Gab2 (10), and Rsf-1 (HBXAP; ref. 6). Fluorescence in
situ hybridization analysis showed 11q13.5 amplification in 13% to
15% of high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas (6, 7). 11q13.5
amplification was significantly associated with worse clinical
outcome in patients with high-grade serous carcinomas in
independent retrospective cohorts (6, 11). Besides ovarian cancer,
this amplicon is frequently detected in several human malignancies including breast, oral, esophageal, and head and neck
carcinomas (12). These findings suggest that gene(s) within this
amplicon may contribute to clinical aggressiveness in the
neoplasms with 11q13.5 amplification.
The clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients depends on
several factors, and the development of drug resistance is one of
the main causes that account for the poor prognosis in patients
who suffer from this disease. To identify the potential gene(s)
within the 11q13.5 amplicon that may play a mechanistic role in
developing drug resistance in high-grade ovarian serous carcinomas, we first selected the top six genes within this amplicon that
showed the most significant correlation between DNA and RNA
copy number from a total of 14 genes within the amplicon. After
knockdown of each gene using RNA interference, we determined
their sensitivity to paclitaxel and carboplatin, which are routinely
used in treating ovarian cancer patients after cytoreduction
surgery. We found that Rsf-1 knockdown significantly decreased
the IC50 of paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells. In this study, we
further characterized the molecular mechanism of how Rsf-1
expression contributed to the development of drug resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. Ovarian cancer cells including
OVCAR3, SKOV3, and A2780 cells were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection, and MPSC1 was previously established by us (13).
Paclitaxel- and carboplatin-resistant cell lines were generated by selecting
the viable MPSC1, A2780, OVCAR3, and SKOV3 cells 3 mo after exposure to
paclitaxel (0.25–0.5 Amol/L) or carboplatin (0.5–2.0 Ag/mL). The resistant
cell clones from each cell line were maintained in culture medium
containing paclitaxel (0.25 Amol/L for SKOV3 and 0.5 Amol/L for A2780,
OVCAR3, and MPSC1) or carboplatin (2.0 Ag/mL for SKOV3 and MPSC1,
1.0 Ag/mL for A2780, and 0.5 Ag/mL for OVCAR3). All the cell lines used in
this study were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum.
Selection of genes within the 11q13.5 amplicon for functional
studies. As reported in our previous study (6), 10 high-grade ovarian serous
carcinomas with 11q13.5 amplification and 53 control specimens without

such amplification were analyzed to assess mRNA levels in all the genes
within the minimal amplicon using quantitative real-time PCR. The control
group included 1 freshly brushed ovarian surface epithelium (kind gift from
Dr. M. Birrer, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), 6 benign cystadenomas,
10 serous borderline tumors, and 36 high-grade serous carcinomas that did
not harbor 11q13.5 amplification. In our previous report (6), we performed
quantitative real-time PCR for all the genes except NARS2 because this gene
has only recently been updated to the genome assembly database. Thus, the
NARS2 expression level was analyzed in this study using the same method
as used for other genes (6). The Mann-Whitney (rank sum) test was used to
determine the significance in individual gene expression between 11q13.5amplified and nonamplified specimens.
Rsf-1 inducible cell clones. The full-length Rsf-1 gene tagged with a V5
epitope tag at the COOH-terminal was cloned into the Tet-off expression
vector, pTRE-hygro (Clontech). Parental SKOV3 cells were first transfected
with a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) expression vector, and
the tTA stable clones were selected by G418 (300 Ag/mL). The inducible
Rsf-1 vector was then introduced into the SKOV3-tTA cells, and the stable
transfectants were selected by 150 Ag/mL hygromycin and maintained in
the culture medium containing 300 Ag/mL G418, 150 Ag/mL hygromycin,
and 2 Ag/mL doxycycline. In this study, we selected two clones of Rsf-1
inducible cells and the pooled control cells with the tTA-vector only
construct. To determine the efficiency of Rsf-1 induction in the Tet-off
system, we performed Western blots to analyze Rsf-1 protein expression at
different time points after the gene was turned on using doxycycline-free
medium.
Immunohistochemistry. A mouse monoclonal anti–Rsf-1 antibody
(clone 5H2/E4) was purchased from Upstate and was used in immunohistochemistry at a dilution of 1:2,000. The specificity of the antibody has been
validated in previous reports (6, 14). An EnVision+ System peroxidase kit
(DAKO) was used for staining following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissue microarrays
containing 99 high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma tissues for which their
in vitro drug resistance status was available. Immunointensity for Rsf-1 was
scored as low (V2) or high (>2). This criterion was used because of a
significant correlation between immunointensity (score >2) and Rsf-1
amplification (6).
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Relative gene expression was
measured by quantitative real-time PCR using an iCycler (Bio-Rad), and
threshold cycle numbers (C t) were obtained using the iCycler Optical
system interface software. PCR primers were designed using the Primer 3
program. The primers for NARS2 real-time PCR were 5¶-GACTCTGAGGGAGCTG GAGAAC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AAGGTCGGACCAAAGGTAAACA-3¶ (reverse). The primers for cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61) were
5¶-CTCCCTGTTTTTGGAATGGA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGGTCTTGCTGCATTTCTTG-3¶ (reverse). The primers for osteopontin were 5¶TGAAATTCATGGCTGTGGAA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-ATG GTGCATACAAGGCCATC-3¶ (reverse). The primers for CTGF were 5¶-CCTGGTCCAGACCA CAGAGT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGGAGATTTTGGGAGTACGG-3¶
(reverse). The other primers including those for Rsf-1, hSNF2H, and hamyloid precursor protein (APP) genes were shown in previous reports (6,
15). The mean C t of the gene of interest was calculated from replicate
measurements and normalized with the mean C t of a control gene, APP,
for which expression is relatively constant among the SAGE libraries
analyzed (16).
Gene knockdown using small interfering RNA and small hairpin
RNA. For functional screening of the top six genes, we purchased two small
hairpin RNAs (shRNA) for each gene from Sigma. hSNF2H-specific small
interfering RNAs (siRNA; UUCAAAUCGAGUGCAAACA and UUAAUAUCCGAGUAUACCA) and control siRNA that targeted the Luciferase gene
(GAUUAAAUCUUCUAGCGACUGCUUCGC) were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies. Cells were transfected with shRNA or siRNA at a
final concentration of 2 Ag or 200 nmol/L, respectively, using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen). Six hours after transfection, the cells were washed and
harvested the next day for cell growth and drug resistance assays. To
enhance the silencing effect of Rsf-1 transcripts in the follow-up
experiments, we used lentivirus carrying the Rsf-1 shRNA sequence

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

templates (CCGGCCAGTTCTGAAC TTTGAAGATCTCGAGATCTTCAAAGTTCAGAACT) and (CCGGCTTCTGAGA CAAAGGGTTCTACTCGAGTAGAACCCTTTGTCTCAGA), which were inserted into the lentiviral
plasmid (pLKO.1-puro).
Cell growth and drug resistance assay. Cells were grown in 96-well
plates at a density of 3,000 per well. Cell number was measured by the
incorporation of SYBR green I nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes)
using a fluorescence microplate reader (Fluostar from BMG). Data were
determined from four replicates and were expressed as the fold increase to
the control group. For drug resistance assay, cells were seeded in 384-well
plates at a density of 600 per well. After overnight culture, the cells were
treated with a series of concentrations of paclitaxel or carboplatin. Four
days after transfection (i.e., 3 d after drug treatment), 8 AL of CellTiter-Blue
(Promega) were added and the plates were incubated for 5 h. The
absorbance was determined using a fluorescence microplate reader. The
signal produced by conversion of resazurin to resorufin is directly
proportional to viable cell number. Data were determined from four
replicates and were expressed as the fold increase of the control group. IC50
was defined as the concentration that results in a 50% decreased in the
number of cells as compared with that of the control cultures in the
absence of the drug.
GeneChip analysis for transcript expression. RNA was prepared using
a Qiagen RNAeasy kit from Rsf-1 inducible SKOV3 cells (15) in different
experimental conditions. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 arrays were used to
analyze gene expression from Rsf-1–induced SKOV3 cells (48 h after
induction), mock-induced SKOV3 cells (48 h after mock induction), and
vector-only control SKOV3 cells. Probe labeling, hybridization, and scanning
for the arrays were done using the standard protocols at the Johns Hopkins
Microarray Core. The dCHIP program was used to analyze the array data to
select the differentially expressed genes that were overexpressed in the Rsf1–induced group as compared with the mean of control groups including
mock-induced and vector-only control SKOV3 cells. The top up-regulated
and down-regulated genes with corresponding expression values that were
>2.5-fold of increase or decrease as compared with the control were input
into the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis System.4 These genes, called focus
genes, were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from
information updated in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Networks
of these focus genes were then algorithmically generated based on their
connectivity.
Drug resistance clinical assay. The assay was done in Oncotech, Inc.,
using published protocol.5 Briefly, a small piece of fresh tumor tissue was
cultured in agar-based cell culture system, and radioactive thymidine
incorporation was used for measuring cell growth in the presence of
different chemotherapeutic drugs. The level of drug resistance was
quantified and was classified into three groups: (a) low if tumor cells were
inhibited by the tested agent and showed less than median growth; (b)
intermediate if there was moderate tumor growth; and (c) extreme if tumor
cell growth was virtually unaffected by the chemotherapeutic agent. As
defined in previous reports, extreme drug resistance was interpreted as drug
resistant and intermediate and low drug resistance were interpreted as drug
sensitive (1, 11).

Results
Selection of genes within the 11q13.5 amplicon for
functional characterization. Using digital karyotyping to detect
genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in high-grade ovarian
serous carcinomas, we identified a minimal amplicon in the
11q13.5 chromosomal region (6). According to the UCSC Human
Genome Browser Gateway in March 2006,6 there were a total of 14

11q13.5 Amplicon in Ovarian Cancer

Figure 1. Effect of knockdown of the six
genes within the ch11q13.5 amplicon on
IC50 of paclitaxel (A) and carboplatin (B ) in
OVCAR3 cells. Two shRNAs (shRNA1 and
shRNA2) to target each gene were used to
knock down PAK-1, Gab2, Rsf-1, ALG8,
CLNS1A , and INTS4 in OVCAR3 cells with
ch11q13.5 amplification. Vector only was
used as the negative control. Rsf-1 is the
only gene in which shRNAs significantly
reduce IC50 of paclitaxel.

genes in which their complete coding sequences were located
within this minimal amplicon. To identify the candidate cancerdriving genes from the 14 genes, we applied an approach based on
the rationale that a tumor-driving gene, if amplified, is almost
always overexpressed whereas the coamplified ‘‘passenger’’ genes
that are not involved in tumor development may or may not be so
(17). Based on the Mann-Whitney (rank sum) test, we selected six
genes showing the highest correlation between DNA and transcript
copy number (P < 0.001). They included Rsf-1 (HBXAP; P < 0.0001),
INTS4 (P = 0.0001), CLNS1A (P = 0.0001), ALG8 (P = 0.0001), GAB2
(P = 0.0001), and PAK1 (P = 0.0002). The P values for NDUFC2,
C11orf67, and USP35 were 0.0015, 0.012, and 0.022, respectively.

There was no statistical significance for the remaining genes
including GFPD4, AQP11, KCTD14, THRSP, and NARS2. Therefore,
we selected Rsf-1 (HBXAP), INTS4, CLNS1A, ALG8, GAB2, and PAK1
for functional characterization.
Biological effects of gene knockdown of the six candidate
genes. To determine the biological roles of those six genes in
sustaining cell growth and in conferring drug resistance, we
transfected OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, known to harbor a high
level of 11q13.5 amplification, with shRNAs to knockdown each of
the six genes. Two independent shRNAs with satisfied knockdown
efficiency were used for each gene. Cell number of OVCAR3 cells
was determined 1 day and 4 days after shRNA transfection.

Figure 2. Enhanced expression of Rsf-1 protein in
paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Western blot
analysis shows that Rsf-1 protein levels are significantly
higher in the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
as compared with the parental and carboplatin-resistant
cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH ) was used as a loading control.

Supplementary Fig. S1 showed that cell number was most
remarkably reduced in the cells transfected with Rsf-1 shRNAs
as compared with PAK1, Gab2, ALG8, INTS4, and CLNS1A
shRNAs. To determine if these six genes are potentially involved
in drug resistance, we measured the IC50 of paclitaxel and
carboplatin in OVCAR3 cells after shRNA transfection. Of note,
the cell numbers in drug sensitivity assays were normalized to
those in shRNA-treated OVCAR3 cells without drug treatment.
For paclitaxel, we found that a significant decrease in the IC50
occurred only in Rsf-1 gene knockdown but not in other genes
(Fig. 1A). For carboplatin, none of the shRNAs that target these
six genes affected the IC50 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we selected Rsf-1
to further study its role in enhancing paclitaxel resistance in
ovarian cancer cells.
Correlation of Rsf-1 protein expression and drug resistance
in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether Rsf-1 gene upregulation was correlated with paclitaxel resistance, we performed
Western blot on the ovarian cancer cell lines including MPSC1,
A2780, and SKOV3, and performed immunohistochemistry on
clinical tumor specimens. First, we established three paclitaxelresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3TR , A2780TR , and
MPSC1TR , and three carboplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines,
SKOV3CR , A2780CR , and MPSC1CR , by treating the parental cells
with increasing concentrations of paclitaxel and carboplatin. We
then compared Rsf-1 expression between drug-resistant and
parental cells. As shown in Fig. 2, Rsf-1 protein levels were
significantly higher in paclitaxel-resistant cells than their parental
controls in all three cell lines. Like in OVCAR3 cells, the cell
number was decreased in SKOV3TR cells after treatment with Rsf-1
shRNAs (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we determined
whether Rsf-1 expression correlated with paclitaxel resistance in
ovarian cancer cells isolated from the primary tumors in patients
with stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Based on immunohistochemistry, we were able to show that Rsf-1 immunointensity was
significantly associated with increased paclitaxel resistance (Table
1). In contrast, there was no statistically significant correlation
between Rsf-1 expression level and resistance to carboplatin. Rsf-1

immunoreactivity in representative specimens was shown in
Supplementary Fig. S3.
Rsf-1 expression enhances paclitaxel resistance in ovarian
cancer cells. To show the causal role of Rsf-1 in developing drug
resistance, we used Tet-off Rsf-1 inducible SKOV3 ovarian cancer
cells, which expressed a very low level of Rsf-1 in the parental and
noninduced cells (15). Western blot analysis showed that Rsf-1
protein was detected 6 and 12 hours after induction in two
independent clones (Fig. 3A). Rsf-1 expression did not have a
significant effect on cellular proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4);
however, both clone 1 and clone 2 after Rsf-1 induction became
more resistant to paclitaxel than the control clones without Rsf-1
induction (Fig. 3B). The IC50 of paclitaxel in noninduced
(doxycycline on) clone 1 and clone 2 cells were 0.15 and 0.11
Amol/L, respectively, whereas the IC50 of paclitaxel in clone 1 and
clone 2 after Rsf-1 induction (doxycycline off) were 2.8 and
7.2Amol/L, respectively. In contrast, the control cells had a similar
IC50 in both doxycycline-on and doxycycline-off conditions. Rsf-1
induction did not confer carboplatin resistance as reflected by
similar IC50 curves between Rsf-1–induced and noninduced cells
(Fig. 3C).
The role of hSNF2H in Rsf-1–dependent paclitaxel resistance.
It has been known that Rsf-1 interacts with hSNF2H to form an ISWI
chromatin remodeling complex in which Rsf-1 serves as a histone
chaperone and hSNF2H as an ATPase (18–21). Here, we determined
if hSNF2H was required for Rsf-1 to confer paclitaxel resistance. As
shown in Fig. 4A, gene knockdown of hSNF2H reduced its
expression at both mRNA and protein levels in SKOV3 cells.
Reducing hSNF2H expression had only a minimal effect on cell
proliferation in the control SKOV3 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Next, we measured the IC50 of paclitaxel in Rsf-1 inducible SKOV3
cells after transfection with hSNF2H or control siRNA in both Rsf-1–
induced and noninduced conditions. We found that hSNF2H siRNA
significantly decreased the IC50 of paclitaxel in Rsf-1–expressing
SKOV3 cells. In contrast, hSNF2H siRNA had only a modest effect on
the IC50 in cells without Rsf-1 induction (Fig. 4B). Next, we further
tested if hSNF2H knockdown or expression of an Rsf-1 dominant

Figure 3. Rsf-1 induction in SKOV3 cells
increases paclitaxel resistance. A, Western

expression is detectable as early as

in two randomly selected clones (clone 1
and clone 2). B and C, drug resistance

negative protein, Rsf-D4 (15), could sensitize OVCAR3 cells with
abundant endogenous Rsf-1 expression to paclitaxel. We found that
either hSNF2H siRNA or Rsf-D4 reduced the cell proliferation to 81%
and 70% of the controls, respectively. Interestingly, both approaches
also enhanced the paclitaxel sensitivity in OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 4C).
The above results indicated an important role of hSNF2H in Rsf-1–
mediated paclitaxel resistance.
Genes regulated by Rsf-1 expression. To further identify the
Rsf-1–regulated genes and pathways that were potentially involved
in drug resistance, we performed global transcript profiling to
compare gene expression in Rsf-1–induced and control SKOV3
cells (mock induced and vector only controls) using the Affymetrix
U133-Plus 2 microarrays. As compared with the Rsf-1 turn-off
(mock induced) group and the vector-only control, Rsf-1–induced
cells showed up-regulation and down-regulation in 62 genes with
at least 2.5-fold increase or decrease as compared with the controls
(Supplementary Table S1). To identify the hidden connections
among the regulated genes, we performed a network analysis of
the top 25 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated genes using the
Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Systems. Applying this Ingenuity
Network filter, four functional networks could be constituted with
significant Ingenuity scores. The network with the highest score
was related to the Tissue Morphology, Cellular Assembly and
Organization System (Fig. 5A). Several molecular hubs including
nuclear factor nB (NFnB), extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK), Akt, and EGR1 to which many pathways converge were
identified in the network. Among the candidate genes, three
representative genes including osteopontin, cysteine-rich protein
61 (CYR61), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were
selected for validation by quantitative real-time PCR because these

three genes have been implied in the pathogenesis of human
cancer (22–24). As shown in Fig. 5B and C, all three genes showed
statistically significant up-regulation in SKOV3 cells after Rsf-1
induction and showed down-regulation in OVCAR3 cells after Rsf-1
shRNA transfection, indicating that Rsf-1 proteins were required
and sufficient to up-regulate the expression of CYR61, CTGF, and
osteopontin.

Discussion
Chromosome 11q13.5 amplification has been detected in several
types of human cancer, and the presence of the amplicon is
associated with a worse clinical outcome. For example, our
previous reports (6, 11) showed that 11q13.5 amplification in
ovarian serous carcinomas was significantly associated with
shorter overall survival. However, the mechanisms accounting for
the dismal clinical outcome are not clear. In the current study, we
performed a functional genomic screening on genes located in the
11q13.5 amplicon for their roles in developing drug resistance to
paclitaxel and carboplatin, which are routinely used in treating
patients at advanced stages of ovarian cancer. Our result showed
that Rsf-1 (HBXAP) played an important role in conferring
paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells.
Rsf-1/HBXAP encodes a nuclear protein containing several
distinct structure motifs including a PHD domain (25). This
protein was first identified as a novel cellular protein that bound to
the pX nuclear protein of hepatitis B virus (26). HBXAP expression
increases HBV transcription in a pX-dependent manner, suggesting
its role in regulating the virus life cycle. Further studies showed
that the interaction between HBXAP and pX proteins regulated

NF-nB activation (26). Soon after HBXAP was identified, an
independent research group reported the full-length HBXAP
(Rsf-1) protein as a subunit in a chromatin assembly factor, called
ISWI-containing remodeling and spacing factor (RSF; ref. 18). The
human RSF complex is composed of two subunits: the nucleosomedependent ATPase, hSNF2H, and the histone chaperon, Rsf-1
(18, 20, 27). The Rsf-1/hSNF2H (or RSF) complex mediates
nucleosome deposition and assembly and participates in chromatin remodeling by mobilizing nucleosomes in response to a variety
of growth-modifying signals and environmental cues (18–21). Such
nucleosome remodeling is essential for transcriptional regulation
(25, 26, 28), DNA replication (29), and cell cycle progression (30).
We have previously shown that Rsf-1 and hSNF2H were coupregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and that expression of Rsf-1
may likely prevent hSNF2H from protein degradation (15). Ectopic
expression of Rsf-1 in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells with a very low
level of endogenous Rsf-1 expression increased hSNF2H protein
levels and promoted SKOV3 tumor growth in a mouse tumor
xenograft model (15).
Our findings from this study could have several biological and
clinical implications. First, the current results provide a possible
explanation for how 11q13.5 amplification in ovarian serous
carcinomas contributes to shorter overall survival as compared

with those without 11q13.5 amplification (6, 11). It is likely that
tumors with increased DNA copy number of Rsf-1 overexpress
Rsf-1 protein, which renders the de novo paclitaxel resistance. The
Rsf-1–expressing residual tumors after tumor cytoreduction
surgery may survive better during chemotherapy and tend to
recur earlier, and thus they are likely related to poor clinical
outcome in ovarian cancer patients. Second, hSNF2H knockdown
or expression of an Rsf-1 dominant negative protein containing
the hSNF2H binding motif sensitized cancer cells with Rsf-1
overexpression to paclitaxel. These observations suggest that
paclitaxel resistance in Rsf-1 up-regulated cells is mediated by the
chromatin remodeling activity from the Rsf-1/hSNF2H complex.
This finding may have translational implications for new cancer
therapy because enhancing the sensitivity of chemotherapy can
be achieved by inactivating the Rsf-1/hSNF2H or by interrupting
the complex formation in cancer cells. Third, our previous result
showed that hSNF2H was required for cell proliferation and
survival in Rsf-1–expressing OVCAR3 cells but not in SKOV3 cells
with or without Rsf-1 induction. This finding is probably because
OVCAR3 cells with Rsf-1 gene amplification and constitutive upregulation have become molecularly ‘‘addicted’’ to Rsf-1/hSNF2H
expression, whereas SKOV3 cells that have a very low level of
endogenous Rsf-1 expression (15) are less sensitive to hSNF2H

(left ). Similarly, Western blot analysis
shows reduction of hSNF2H expression
by hSNF2H siRNA 24 h after siRNA
transfection in the Rsf-1 inducible SKOV3
cells (right ). siRNA against luciferase was
used as the control. B, Rsf-1 inducible cells
transfected with control or hSNF2H siRNAs
were treated with various concentrations
of paclitaxel under Rsf-1 turned-on or
turned-off condition. Relative cell number in
different treatment group was determined
and presented as percentage of the control
group at day 3 (left ). IC50 of paclitaxel in
Rsf-1 inducible SKOV3 cells transfected
with control or hSNF2H siRNAs were
determined under Rsf-1 turned-on or
turned-off condition (right ). hSNF2H siRNAs
significantly decreases the IC50 of paclitaxel
in Rsf-1–expressing SKOV3 cells. C, effect

on sensitivity of OVCAR3 cells to paclitaxel.
In contrast to SKOV3 cells, OVCAR3 cells
constitutively express Rsf-1 due to a high
level of 11q13.5 amplification. Both hSNF2H
siRNA (left) and Rsf-D4 (right ) significantly
sensitize OVCAR3 cells to paclitaxel
treatment. The cell number at each
concentration points was normalized to
hSNF2H siRNA– and Rsf-D4–treated cells
without paclitaxel treatment.

knockdown even after an acute induction of Rsf-1. However,
reducing hSNF2H expression sensitized both OVCAR3 cells and
Rsf-1–expressing SKOV3 cells to paclitaxel, suggesting that
different mechanisms are involved in promoting cell growth
and drug resistance. Fourth, Rsf-1 expression in tumor specimens
can be used as a surrogate marker alone or in combination with
other markers to predict treatment response to paclitaxel. To this
end, future multi-institutional cohort studies are required to
validate the usefulness of Rsf-1 immunoreactivity as a potential
diagnostic test for ovarian cancer or other cancer types with Rsf-1
amplification and overexpression.
There are at least two possible mechanisms that could explain
how Rsf-1 overexpression contributes to tumor cell survival and
growth in the presence of paclitaxel. First, an increased number of
RSF complexes may concentrate on specific promoter and/or
enhancer regions to modulate transcription activity of a set of
genes which participate in drug resistance. In fact, based on
comparison of gene profiles between Rsf-1–induced and noninduced SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, we found that Rsf-1
expression was associated with changes in the expression of

several genes. Among them, up-regulation of CYR61 and osteopontin is of interest because both gene products were previously
reported to be involved in developing drug resistance (22, 23).
Furthermore, using interaction network analysis, it seems that
several major molecular hubs were identified in this network and
they included NF-nB, ERK, Akt, and EGR1. Among them, NF-nB,
ERK, and Akt have been suggested to participate in developing
chemoresistance in cancer cells (30–37). For example, the Akt
pathway has been shown to play a causal role in the development
of docetaxel and paclitaxel resistance in cancer cell lines including
those derived from ovarian cancer (31–33). It is of great interest
that Rsf-1 has been shown to interact with NF-nB (34). Further
studies are required to show the detailed mechanisms of how the
Rsf-1/hSNF2H complex contributes to tumor development through
their downstream mediators. Second, Rsf-1 overexpression may
alter the dynamics of partnership between hSNF2H and hSNF2H
binding proteins. Besides Rsf-1, hSNF2H is known to interact with
several cellular proteins to form different hSNF2H-containing
protein complexes that have diverse cellular functions. In our
previous study, we showed that excessive Rsf-1 molecules

sequestered hSNF2H, leading to a loss or a decrease in the
abundance of other hSNF2H-binding complexes such as hSNF2H/
BAZ1A and hSNF2H/BAZ1B (15). Because several members in the
SNF family have been suggested as tumor suppressors and are
found to be down-regulated or inactivated in cancer tissues (35,
36), it is plausible that reduction of these hSNF2H complexes with
tumor suppressor potential by excessive Rsf-1 contributes to the
observed drug-resistant phenotype in cancer cells. However, in this
study, we found that expressing the Rsf-D4 deletion mutant, which
has the hSNF2H binding activity, enhanced the growth inhibitory
effect of paclitaxel in tumor cells. This observation suggests that
sequestering hSNF2H from other protein complexes by the Rsf-D4
mutant alone is not able to confer paclitaxel resistance as seen in
the full-length Rsf-1. Therefore, the paclitaxel-resistant phenotype
mediated by the full-length Rsf-1 is more likely due to an increase
in RSF complex formation rather than a decrease in other hSNF2Hcontaining complexes.
Although the above represents our preferred views, alternative
interpretations should be indicated. First, the shRNA screening
approach used in this study suggests that Rsf-1 is the main gene
within the 11q13.5 amplicon responsible for paclitaxel resistance.
However, other gene(s) within the 11q13.5 amplicon might also be
involved in the aggressive behavior of 11q13.5-amplified carcinomas. For example, PAK1, a member of serine/threonine kinase
family, plays a critical role in controlling anchorage-independent
growth and invasiveness in breast cancer cells (37) and in
promoting mammalian tumorigenesis (38) and angiogenesis (39).
Thus, PAK1 expression may lead to a more aggressive clinical
course in ovarian cancer. It is thus plausible that Rsf-1
collaborates with PAK1 and other genes to propel tumor
progression. Second, similar to other dominant negative
approaches that are applied to modulate activity of endogenous

proteins, the Rsf-D4 approach reported in this study may not be
specific to interrupt the interaction between Rsf-1 and hSNF2H. It
is possible that the Rsf-D4 mutant may complex with other
protein(s) besides hSNF2H and that overexpression of Rsf-D4 can
potentially interfere with the binding of these protein(s) to the
endogenous full-length Rsf-1. Finally, Although the correlation is
statistically significant, seven tissues with high Rsf-1 did not show
significant drug resistance. This finding suggests that other factors
may also play a role in conferring a paclitaxel resistance phenotype that is independent of Rsf-1.
In summary, we showed in this report that development of
paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells was attributed, at least
in part, to Rsf-1, which is frequently amplified in several types of
human cancer. We further showed that the formation of Rsf-1 and
hSNF2H chromatin remodeling complexes was essential for
developing this resistance phenotype. Our results suggest that
Rsf-1 can be used as a biomarker for paclitaxel resistance and can
be exploited as a potential target for chemosensitization in
carcinomas with Rsf-1 amplification or overexpression.
