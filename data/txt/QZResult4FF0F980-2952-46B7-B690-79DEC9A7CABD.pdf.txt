ABSTRACT:
Cell migration is an essential step in cancer invasion and metastasis. A number of
orchestrated cellular events involving tyrosine kinases and signaling receptors enable
cancer cells to dislodge from primary tumors and colonize elsewhere in the body. For
example, activation of the Src and Abl kinases can mediate events that promote
tumor cell migration. Also, activation of the Robo1 receptor can induce tumor cell
migration. However, while the importance of Src, Abl, and Robo1 in cell migration
have been demonstrated, molecular mechanisms by which they collectively influence
cell migration have not been clearly elucidated. In addition, little is known about
mechanisms that control Robo1 expression. We report here that Src activates Abl to
stabilize Robo1 in order to promote cell migration. Inhibition of Abl kinase activity by
siRNA or kinase blockers decreased Robo1 protein levels and suppressed the
migration of transformed cells. We also provide evidence that Robo1 utilizes Cdc42
and Rac1 GTPases to induce cell migration. In addition, inhibition of Robo1 signaling
can suppress transformed cell migration in the face of robust Src and Abl kinase
activity. Therefore, inhibitors of Src, Abl, Robo1 and small GTPases may target a
coordinated pathway required for tumor cell migration.

of GTPases to modify effectors including N-WASP to
promote cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility
[3,7,8]. However, Src also relies on parallel pathways
to induce tumor cell growth and migration [9,10].
The Abl kinase can phosphorylate the Robo1
receptor [11]. Robo1 is a transmembrane receptor of
the immunoglobulin family [7,12]. Upon binding to its
ligand, Slit2, Robo1 works with the Abl kinase to
rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and induce cell
migration [13,14]. Indeed, cell migration can be
inhibited by blocking Robo1 receptor activity with a
monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of the
protein [14]. Hence, the Abl kinase provides a link

INTRODUCTION
Tumor cell migration leads to metastasis, which is
responsible for about 90% of deaths caused by cancer
[1]. Signaling by a number of different growth factors,
including EGF and PDGF, can activate the Src and Abl
kinases in order to promote tumor cell invasion and
metastasis [2,3]. Src and Abl are nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases, that can inturn phosphorylate a variety of
substrates, including Cas, Crk, and paxillin, to initiate
cell spreading and migration [4-6]. Src phosphorylates
Abl [2], which associates with actin and the Rho family

expression of Slit2 [15] which binds to its receptor,
Robo1, to promote cell migration [13,14,19,22]. We
utilized expression microarrays to further investigate
the effect of Src kinase activity on Slit2 mRNA
expression. As shown in Figure 1a, these data indicate
that Src transformed cells expressed over 4 times more
Slit2 mRNA than nontransformed cells.
As stated above, Slit2 is a secreted protein that
binds to the Robo1 receptor [13,14,19,22]. Upon Slit2
binding to Robo1 the activity of the Rho GTPases are
regulated to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and
induce cell motility [7]. Therefore, if Slit2 were
promoting tumor cell migration, Src may also be
expected to increase Robo1 expression in transformed
cells. However, Affymetrix microarray data indicate
that Src transformed cells contained less Robo1 mRNA
than nontransformed cells (Figure 1a). The suppression
of Robo1 mRNA expression by Src was also confirmed
by qRT-PCR as shown in Figure 1b.
Src phosphorylates Cx43 to block gap junctional
communication between transformed cells [23,24].

between Robo1 and the actin cytoskeleton. However,
the role of Src kinase activity in this pathway has not
been defined.
Here, we describe a molecular relationship between
Src, Abl, and Robo1 that promotes tumor cell
migration. Our data indicate that Src activates the Abl
kinase, which in turn, stabilizes the expression of
Robo1 and increases GTPase activity to promote tumor
cell migration. These results demonstrate how
monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors may be
used to target specific components of the
Src/Abl/Robo1 pathway to prevent tumor cell
migration at multiple steps.
RESULTS
Src augments Robo1 production in transformed
cells
The Src kinase activates a variety of pathways that
promote cell migration [9,10]. For example, data from
previous experiments indicate that Src induces the

increasing Robo1 protein levels (Figure 1a-1c). These
data suggest that Src can stabilize Robo1 protein in
transformed cells. To investigate this, we measured the
effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide
on the stability of Robo1 in nontransformed and Src
transformed cells. After 24 hours of cyclohexamide
treatment, about 75% of Robo1 remained in Src
transformed cells compared to about 40% in
nontransformed cells (Figure 2a). Thus, Src appeared
to increase Robo1 protein stability in transformed cells
by about 2 fold.
As shown in Figure 2b, Robo1 was found at the
membrane of Src transformed cells where it may act as
a functional receptor to promote tumor cell migration
and invasion. In addition, a Robo1-GFP fusion
construct was also utilized to examine the location of
Robo1 in nontransformed and Src transformed cells.
As seen in Figure 2c, this Robo1-GFP protein was
found mostly at the plasma membrane of Src

Indeed, Cx43 can act as a tumor suppressor in a
number of cell types including mammary carcinoma
[25,26] and glioma cells [27-29]. In contrast, Robo1
activity can promote glioma cell migration [30] and
metastasis of breast cancer cells to the brain [31]. Thus,
we sought to analyze the role of Robo1 in the
migration of wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts
that express Cx43, as well as brain cells from Cx43
knockout mice (Cx43Ko cells). Cx43 did not affect the
ability of Src to decrease Robo1 expression at the
mRNA level. As shown in Figure 1b, results from
qRT-PCR revealed that both Src transformed Cx43Ko
and wild type cells expressed less than half as much
Robo1 mRNA as nontransformed cells. However, in
contrast to mRNA expression, Src appeared to augment
Robo1 protein expression in both Cx43Ko and wild
type cells by about 2 fold (Figure 1c-1d).
Taken together, qRT-PCR and protein analyses
indicate that Src decreased Robo1 mRNA levels while

more diffusely through the cytoplasm in
nontransformed cells and transformed cells treated with
an Abl kinase blocker (GNF-2), as discussed below.

Src transformed Cx43Ko and wild type cells
achieved similar levels of anchorage independence (see
Figure 3a and 3b). In addition, Src significantly
increased the motility of both Cx43Ko and wild type
cells. Src transformed Cx43Ko and wild type cells
migrated about 3 fold and 6 fold more than
nontransformed cells, respectively (Figure 3c and

Cells obtained from wild type (WT) or homozygous null Cx43 knockout (Cx43Ko) mouse embryos were

Abl antibody. Reciprocal experiments were also
performed; lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiAbl antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Robo1. As
shown in Figure 4b, results from these experiments
indicate that Robo1 and Abl associated with each other
in both Src transformed and nontransformed cells.
However, as shown in Figure 4b, phosphotyrosine
residues were detected in Robo1 from transformed
cells, but not nontransformed cells. These data suggest
that Src or Abl can phosphorylate Robo1 in
transformed cells.
We utilized siRNA and a chemical kinase blocker
to determine if Src utilized Abl to augment Robo1
protein expression. As shown in Figure 5, Abl siRNA
effectively silenced Abl protein expression and kinase
activity in Src transformed cells by about 70% and
40%, respectively. This resulted in a similar decrease
in Robo1 expression. Moreover, treatment of Src
transformed cells with the Abl kinase blocker GNF-2
did not affect Abl protein levels, but reduced Abl
kinase activity by over 90% and, consequently reduced
Robo1 expression by about 50% (Figure 5).
Cyclohexamide treatment shown in Figure 2a also
indicates that Src utilized Abl to stabilize Robo1 at the
protein level. After 24 hours of cyclohexamide
treatment, about 75% of Robo1 remained in Src
transformed cells compared to about 40% in
nontransformed cells or transformed cells treated with
the Abl blocker GNF-2 (Figure 2a). As shown in
Figure 2c, inhibition of Abl kinase activity by GNF-2
also resulted in intracellular cytoplasmic Robo1
localization similar to that seen in nontransformed
cells, as opposed to plasma membrane localization seen
in Src transformed controls. These data suggest that
Abl may stabilize Robo1 at the plasma membrane. It
should be noted that GNF-2 is highly specific for the
Abl kinase [33], having no detectable effect on Src
kinase activity at the concentrations used here (see
Figure 5a). Thus, Robo1 expression at the cell
membrane appeared to depend on Abl kinase activity
in Src transformed cells.
The effects of abrogating Abl kinase activity on cell
migration were also examined. As shown in Figure 3c
and Supplementary Figure S1, these data indicate that
Abl kinase activity promoted the migration of Src
transformed cells. Src transformed cells treated with
GNF-2 migrated about 5 fold less than control cells.
Taken together, these data indicate that Src activated
Abl to induce Robo1 expression in order to increase
migration of transformed cells as illustrated in Figure
6.
Abl kinase activity has been implicated in the
progression of non small cell lung cancer [34].

Supplementary Figure S1).
As mentioned above, Slit2/Robo1 signaling can
promote glioma cell migration [30] and metastasis of
breast cancer cells to the brain [31]. We utilized a
neutralizing antibody (R5 Ab) to examine the effects of
Robo1 on the motility of Src transformed cells. This
monoclonal antibody targets the first immunoglobulin
domain of Robo1 to block activation of Robo1
signaling [14,19]. As described above, Src significantly
increased the migration of Cx43Ko and wild type cells.
As shown in Figure 3c, application of R5 Robo1
antiserum suppressed the migration of these Src
transformed cells by at least 2 fold. As shown in Figure
1c, in contrast to mRNA levels, Src transformed cells
actually expressed less Slit2 protein than
nontransformed cells. In addition, conditioned medium
from Src transformed cells did not affect the migration
of nontransformed cells, indicating that Slit2 induction
was not sufficient to account for the increased
migration of Src transformed cells (see Supplementary
Figure S2). Thus, these data indicate that Src
augmented Robo1, but not Slit2, production to promote
tumor cell migration. However, the data also clearly
indicate that Robo1 induced migration in a Slit2
dependent manner.
Src activates Abl to augment Robo1 expression and
GTPase activity.
Many axon guidance receptors, including Robo1,
regulate the Rho family of GTPases to affect cell
motility. N-WASP is an effector through which Rho
GTPases regulate the actin cytoskeleton [7]. Effects of
R5 antiserum are also evident on N-WASP activity.
Application of the R5 antiserum reduced N-WASP
activity by over 60% (Figure 3d).
Robo1 interacts with the Abl kinase to initiate
cytoskeleton rearrangement [11,32]. However, in
contrast to this proposed role of Abl as a Robo1
effector, we hypothesized that Src activates Abl to
stabilize Robo1 expression in transformed cells. As
seen in Figure 4a, although Abl protein expression
levels were similar in both Src transformed and
nontransformed cells, Src increased the activity of Abl
in transformed cells by several fold.
Results from immunoprecipitation studies indicate
that Robo1 and Abl associate with each other and that
Robo1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in Src
transformed cells. Lysates from Src transformed and
nontransformed cells were immunoprecipitated with
anti-Robo1 antiserum and immunoblotted with anti-

As shown in Figure 7a, NCI-H28 mesothelioma cells
exhibited robust Abl activity and Robo1 protein
expression which were reduced by over 80% and 40%,
respectively, by treatment with GNF-2. As shown in
Figure 7b, GNF-2 and R5 antiserum reduced NCI-H28
cell migration by about 50% and 75%, respectively
(also see Supplementary Figure S3). These studies
indicate that the Abl kinase can augment Robo1 protein
levels to promote the migration of mesothelioma cells.
Robo1 modulates Rho GTPase activity to affect the
actin cytoskeleton. In particular, Cdc42 and Rac1
associate with N-WASP to regulate actin remodeling
leading to filopodia and lamellipodia movement
required for cell migration [7,31]. As shown in Figure
3d, Robo1 appeared to activate N-WASP in Src
transformed cells. We therefore, sought to determine if
Cdc42 or Rac1 activity were affected during Robo1
mediated migration of Src transformed cells. As shown
in Figure 8, while total Cdc42 and Rac1 protein levels
were not affected, R5 antiserum reduced levels of GTP
bound Cdc42 and Rac1 by approximately 50%. These
data are consistent with a role for Cdc42 and Rac1 in
tumor cell migration mediated by Robo1.

Studies have implicated Robo1 in liver, breast, and
brain cancers [30,31,40,41]. Moreover, Robo1
signaling can augment tumor angiogenesis [13,22].

play critical roles in tumor cell migration leading to

order to activate Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases, which
leads to N-WASP activation.
Previous studies suggest that Abl can inhibit Robo1
signaling [11], and that Robo1 can decrease Cdc42
activation during axon guidance and neuronal
migration [7]. However, in contrast to previous
observations from studies in developing drosophila and
mouse embryos [7,11], results from our studies
demonstrate that Src activates the Abl kinase, which in
turn stabilizes Robo1 protein to increase Cdc42 and
Rac1 GTPases activity to promote transformed cell
migration. Indeed, suppression of Abl activity (with
siRNA or GNF-2) decreased Robo1 protein levels and
inhibited the migration of transformed cells. In
addition, inhibition of Robo1 signaling by monoclonal
antiserum inhibited tumor cell migration without
affecting Abl kinase activity. As illustrated in Figure 6,
these studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies and

Robo1 [11,32,42]. However, actual mechanisms by
which Src, Abl, and Robo1 work together to promote
cell migration have not been defined. Here, we provide
evidence that Robo1 plays an important role in tumor
cell migration induced by Src and Abl.
Many axon guidance receptors including Robo1
regulate the Rho family of GTPases to effect changes
in motility. Rho GTPases are members of the Ras
superfamiliy. There are over 20 mammalian Rho
GTPases [43]. When bound to GTP, these GTPases
target effectors to modify the actin cytoskeleton. In
particular, 3 Rho GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42
activate members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
proteins (WASPs) and WASP verprolin homologous
proteins (WAVEs) which, in turn, activate actin
polymerization factors, including Arp2/3 and formin,
to cause elongation and branching of actin fibers [4446]. Our data indicate that Slit2 binds to Robo1 in

with Cx43Ko and wild type cells, with results from Cx43Ko cells shown. Single and triple asterisks indicate p

kinase inhibitors may be used to target specific
components of the Src/Abl/Robo1 pathway to prevent
tumor cell migration at multiple steps.
Our data indicate that the induction of cell
migration by Robo1 is highly regulated. Suppression of
Robo1 mRNA production by Src, coupled with the
need for Abl to stabilize Robo1 protein at the plasma
membrane ensure that cell migration results from a
response to a combination of appropriate stimuli. Thus,
two oncogenic kinases, Src and Abl, must work
together to promote Robo1-mediated cell migration.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI
RNA Isolation Reagent (T9424, Sigma). cDNA was
then synthesized using Protoscript first strand cDNA
synthesis Kit (E6500S, BioLabs). Quantitative RTPCR amplification of Robo1 and Actin cDNA was
performed with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad)
using primers for Actin (5'-CCCAGAGCAAGAGAGG-3'
and 5'-GTCCAGACGCAGGAT-3') and Robo1 (5’GAGGTAGCTATACTACGGGATGAC-3’
and 5’CAGATGTAGTAGCCGACATCAGAC-3’). SYBR
green emission intensities were measured during the
amplification reaction with an iCycler detection system
(Applied Biosystems 7800).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and treatments
Cells obtained from wild type (WT) or homozygous
null Cx43 knockout (Cx43Ko) mouse embryos were
transfected with v-Src or the empty parental vector and
cultured as described [15-18]. For some experiments,
nontransformed and Src transformed Cx43Ko cells
were transfected with a Robo1-GFP expression vector,
which was generated by cloning the entire coding
region of Robo1 (accession #: AF040990) into the
Nhe1-Sac1 sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). NCIH28
mesothelioma cells were obtained from the ATCC. For
some experiments, cells were treated overnight with 50
µg/ml cyclohexamide (Sigma, C7698), 60 nM R5
antibody to the extracellular region of Robo1, 60 nM
control IgG antibody [14,19], or 40 µM GNF-2 Abl
kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem, 197221).

Western blotting and Immunoprecipitation
For co-immunoprecipitation studies, cells were
lysed in CSK buffer (100mM NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2,
10mM pipes pH 6.8) containing 0.5% Triton-X-100,
1mM sodium vanadate (Sigma, S6508), 1mM PMSF
(Sigma, P7626), 50mM NaF (Sigma, S7920) and 1%
Protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells
(Sigma, P2417). For phosphotyrosine studies, cells
were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.9) containing 125
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.75% Triton
X-100, 1 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1mM PMSF and 10 µg/ml proteinase
inhibitor mixture (Sigma, catalog number P2714).
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated
with either Robo1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 16612)
or Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC 23) at 4oC
overnight. Protein A/G (Santa Cruz) or protein G
(Pierce, 20398) were added and the reaction was
incubated for an additional 2h. Immune complexes
were washed with lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling
the samples in sample buffer (7.5% SDS, 80mM DTT,
0.25M Tris pH6.8, 8.25% glycerol, 0.01%
bromophenol blue). Total protein was obtained from
cells lysed in buffer containing 62.5mM Tris-HCl
(pH6.8), 50mM DTT, 2% SDS and 10% glycerol.
Proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis,
transferred to Immobilion-P membranes (Millipore
IPVH00010), and subjected to immunoblotting with

Expression microarrays
Gene expression in nontransformed and Src
transformed Cx43Ko cells was examined by
microarray analysis with Mouse Genome 430 2.0
Arrays (Affymetrix) as previously described
[15,16,18]. These arrays contain approximately 45,000
probe sets which represent over 30,000 genes. Affected
probe sets displayed a difference of at least 4 fold
between transformed and nontransformed cells, or at
least a 2 fold change with p<0.05 by t-test with n=2.
All comparisons were done with cells from parallel
cultures to control for variability in reagents or
experimental conditions. Expression analysis was
performed with Vector Xpression software 4.0
(Invitrogen).

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in
PBS, permeabilized with acetone in PBS, blocked with
BSA, incubated with anti-Robo1 antibody (Abcam),
stained with a FITC conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (Invitrogen, Alexa 488, A-11008), rinsed in
PBS, and then immersed in PBS containing 1ug/ml
Hoechst 33258 for 1 min. Images were obtained with a
Carl Zeiss LSM510 meta confocal microscope
equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63X objective.
Argon (ex:488nm), and UV (ex:364nm) lasers were
used with appropriate band pass filters (BP:505-530,
BP:420-480) to detect Alexa 488 and Hoechst 33342
respectively.

The authors declare they have no conflict of interest.

Cdc42/Rac activity assays

1.

Cells (10,000 per well) were plated in standard
tissue culture treated 12-well plates (Falcon, 3043) or
in ultra low attachment 24-well plates (Corning, 3473)
to assay anchored and nonanchored growth,
respectively, as previously described [15,16,18]. Cell
numbers were determined by Coulter counter at the
indicated time points. Cell migration was measured by
a wound healing assay in which confluent layers were
scratched with a plastic pipette tip, washed with fresh
medium, and cultured for 24 hours. The number of
cells entering the wound were counted from phasecontrast images obtained with a digital camera
(AxioCam MRm) attached to a Zeiss microscope
(Axiovert 40 CFL) equipped with Axiovision 4.5
software as described [21].

Cdc42 activation was measured by affinity
precipitation of cellular GTP-bound form of Cdc42 as
described [20]. Cells were untreated or treated with
60nM IgG or R5 antibody for 8 hours. Cells were lysed
(50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 %
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 10 µg/ml
each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mM PMSF)
and incubated with GST fused to the Cdc42/Rac (p21)-binding domain of PAK bound to glutathionecoupled agarose beads (GST-PBD) for 90 minutes at
4°C. The fusion protein beads with bound proteins
were then washed three times in lysis buffer, eluted in
sample buffer and analyzed by western blotting.
