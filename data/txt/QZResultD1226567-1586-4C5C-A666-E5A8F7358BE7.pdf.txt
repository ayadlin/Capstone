Bone Marrow–Derived Cells in Glioblastoma

Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by a pathogenic vasculature that drives aggressive local
invasion. Recent work suggests that GBM cells recruit bone marrow–derived progenitor cells (BMDC) to
facilitate recurrence after radiotherapy, but how this may be achieved is unclear. In this study, we established
the spatiotemporal and regional contributions of perivascular BMDCs (pBMDC) to GBM development.
We found an increased recruitment of BMDCs to GBM in response to tumor growth and following
radiotherapy. However, in this study, BMDCs did not differentiate into endothelial cells directly but rather
provided a perivascular support role. The pBMDCs were shown to associate with tumor vasculature in a
highly region-dependent manner, with central vasculature requiring minimal pBMDC support. Regiondependent association of pBMDC was regulated by VEGF. In the absence of VEGF, following radiotherapy or
antiangiogenic therapy, we documented an increase in Ang2 that regulated recruitment of pBMDCs to
maintain the vulnerable central vasculature. Together, our results strongly suggested that targeting pBMDC
inﬂux along with radiation or antiangiogenic therapy would be critical to prevent vascular recurrence of
GBM. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3727–39. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequently
occurring and aggressive of all primary adult brain tumors
(1, 2). Despite maximal surgical resection followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the prognosis for
patients with GBM remains extremely poor, with median
survival time being 12 to 16 months and an almost 100%
recurrence rate (1–3). A major histopathologic hallmark of
GBMs is increased vascular endothelial proliferation, making
GBMs one of the most highly vascularized solid malignancies
(1, 2). Given their hyperproliferative vasculature, novel
antiangiogenic therapies are actively being explored (4, 5).
Unfortunately, despite some positive early therapeutic beneﬁts, overall patient outcomes have not signiﬁcantly improved
with antiangiogenic therapies (6). Resistance to antiangiogenic
therapies indicates that there remains, as yet, an unexplored
mechanism of neovascularization that allows GBM cells to
evade therapy and continue to grow.

Like other solid cancers, GBM uses complex molecular
cascades to create an independent vascular network sustaining
growth and recurrence following therapy (3, 6, 7). There has
been emerging interest in understanding the role of bone
marrow–derived cells (BMDC) in cancer and their contribution to tumor neovascularization (8, 9). The literature remains
controversial as work from several laboratories suggests that
BMDCs do not incorporate into the vessel lumen to a significant extent but rather stay adjacent to the vessel in the
perivascular niche (10), whereas other reports suggests that
endothelial cells in glioma models are directly derived from
BMDCs (11, 12).
One of the challenges in being able to deﬁnitively establish
whether circulating progenitor cells differentiate to form
endothelial cells lies in the limitations of histopathologic
analysis in distinguishing between different cell types and the
origin of cells that compose a vascular structure. We have
established an experimental strategy that takes advantage
of 2-photon laser microscopy (2PLM) coupled with an intracranial window in mouse models of GBM to obtain in vivo
real-time longitudinal imaging of normal brain and GBMassociated vasculature (13). We take advantage of this experimental strategy to complement traditional immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunoﬂuorescent analysis by allowing
direct visualization of single cells intracranially.
In this study, we demonstrate that BMDCs do not directly
differentiate into endothelial cells during brain tumor growth
or following radiotherapy but provide a supportive role as
perivascular cells. We show that BMDCs have a highly regiondependent association with GBM neovascularization, where
beyond a critical tumor volume, BMDCs are not required for
maintaining the central vasculature. VEGF regulates the

regional recruitment of perivascular BMDCs (pBMDC). Loss of
VEGF, either through antiangiogenic therapies or radiotherapy, results in upregulation of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), which in
turn signals recruitment of pBMDCs to support and restore the
vulnerable central vasculature following therapy. Blocking
Ang2, following loss of VEGF, prevents the inﬂux of pBMDCs
in central vessels, conﬁrming that an interplay between VEGF
and Ang2 is central to the regional association of pBMDC.
These results suggest targeting pBMDCs concurrent with
radiotherapy and antiangiogenic therapies will be an important therapeutic strategy for preventing GBM recurrence following therapy.

Materials and Methods
All animal procedures were carried out according to animal
user protocols approved ethically by Institutional Animal Care
Committee under the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care.
For all sections, see Supplementary Methods for full procedure outline.
Cell lines
U87MG and U251MG GBM cell lines and GSC8-18 stem cell
lines were used for intracranial xenograft models (Cell lines
were obtained from ATCC or MD Anderson, Houston, TX; all
lines are regularly authenticated on the basis of viability,
recovery, growth, and morphology, most recently conﬁrmed
3 months before use). Cells were grown as previously described
(13–15).
Cell transfections
Cell lines (U87MG, U251, GSC8-18) were transfected
with either FuGENE HD (Roche) or Lonza-Amaxa electroporation, as per commercial instructions, to express
constituently the mCherry ﬂuorescent gene (pCAG:
mCherry:Puro courtesy of Dr. Peter Tonge) or PBase-VEGFTrap (Dr. Andras Nagy).
Bone marrow reconstitutions
Bone marrow was extracted from 8- to 10-week-old donor
transgenic GFP/RFP mice (Dr. Andras Nagy) and transplanted
into 3 irradiated host mice, as previously described (13, 16).
Xenograft models of GBM
For all experimental arms, including control, 10 mice were
used, and all experimental arms were performed in triplicate.
Chimeric bone marrow mice underwent intracranial window surgery, as previously described (13, 16). Mice were
streamed into cohorts of control (no cell injection); GSC
Cherry 2.5  104 cells injected; U87/U251 Cherry/VEGFTrap
4  105 cells injected.
Transgenic mouse models
GBM transgenic mouse model, RASB8, was generated
through integration of a V12 RASB8 mutation under the
control of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein-promoter, leaving
mice predisposed to sporadic GBM-like astrocytoma (17).

3728

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

Both normal RASB8 and chimeric bone marrow RASB8 mice
were used in the study.
Targeted radiotherapy
Experimental mice undergo targeted radiotherapy on the
Xrad225 small animal irradiator at set treatment regimens of
single 2, 6, or 15 Gy or fractionated 3  2 and 3  5 Gy, as
previously described (13, 16).
Chemotherapy/Drug therapy
Temozolomide (Sigma) was administered at 60 mg/kg daily
for 5 days administered 1 hour before all radiotherapy doses.
Doxycycline (Bioserve) was administered in the mouse chow at
3 mg/mL 1 week following tumor implantation to turn on
VEGFTrap. AMG386 (Amgen) was administered twice weekly
at 10 mg/kg as an intravenous injection at the beginning of
either radiotherapy or VEGFTrap therapy.
Real-time in vivo imaging
Experimental mice were imaged on an inverted confocal
microscope through the intracranial window generated, as
previously described (13, 16). Intravenous ﬂuorescent dextran (Invitrogen) or CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen) was
administered 5 minutes before the imaging session to
highlight vasculature.
MRI
Serial multiparametric MRI protocol was carried out on a
7-Tesla Bruker MRI system to look at anatomy and perfusion,
as previously described (18).
Histologic analysis: IHC and IF
Mice at end point were sacriﬁced with paraformaldehyde
perfusion, as previously described. Optimal cutting temperature blocks of the brain were made and sectioned at 5-mm
intervals onto coated glass slides. Sections were air dried and
inhibited for peroxidase and biotin activity. Slides were
blocked before primary incubation and then washed three
times before secondary incubation. IHC slides then underwent
a peroxidase labeling treatment before DAB color development. Slides were dehydrated and mounted.
Semiquantiﬁcation image analysis
For 2PLM data quantiﬁcation, 10 high-powered ﬁelds were
analyzed on ImageJ. IHC and IF image analyses were carried
out on 10 high-powered ﬁelds in Kati-Kat cell counting software. All were carried out by three blinded counters.
Laser capture microscopy
Frozen tissue was sectioned onto laser capture microscopy
(LCM) slides and dehydrated through alcohols before loading
onto the microscope. Vessels were isolated through GFP
content, a minimum of 15 per sample.
Quantitative PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from LCM samples as per the Picopure
RNA Extraction Kit (Applied Biosciences), and cDNA synthesized using superscript VILO kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was

Results
BMDCs are recruited to GBMs in a tumor growth stagedependent manner
We examined the longitudinal response of BMDCs to GBM
growth in both intracranial xenograft models of GBM (U87 and
glioma stem cells; GSC) and in the spontaneous mouse models
of high-grade gliomas, RasB8 (15, 17, 19, 20). In vivo 2PLM
images of BMDCs in GBM xenografts show that BMDCs are
recruited via the intracranial vasculature speciﬁcally to the site
of tumor growth (Fig. 1A and B) as proven by minimal GFPþ
BMDCs seen in control non–tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1C) and
contralateral brain. Similarly, BMDCs are recruited speciﬁc
to the tumor foci in transgenic RASB8 models (Fig. 1D). BMDCs
populate three distinct anatomical distribution: circulating intravascular, pBMDC, and stromal BMDC (Fig. 1E–G).
pBMDCs are seen as those BMDCs that migrate out of the
vasculature but remain intimately associated with the vessels
(Fig. 1F). In both xenograft and transgenic models of GBMs, we
observe recruitment, migration, and inﬁltration of BMDCs,
which increases signiﬁcantly in a longitudinal manner in
response to the tumor growth (Fig. 1H).
Response of BMDCs following chemotherapy and
radiotherapy of GBM
We next examined the response of BMDCs to GBMs
treated with radiotherapy and the clinically relevant alkylating chemotherapy, temozolomide. Radiotherapy demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in ﬁnal tumor
volume (Fig. 2A and B) together with a statistically significant increase in BMDC recruitment in both 2PLM and ex
vivo IF analysis of xenografts and transgenic tumors (Fig.
2C, i and ii, D, and E). In comparison, irradiation of normal
brain results in recruitment of BMDCs speciﬁcally to the
site of radiotherapy, with minimal migration into the surrounding microenvironment (Fig. 2F; ref. 13). Furthermore,
extent of BMDCs seen in response to radiotherapy in GBMs
is signiﬁcantly greater than that seen in radiotherapy alone
and untreated GBMs (Fig. 2G). Chemotherapy, using temozolomide did not result in a change in the pattern or extent
of BMDC recruitment (Fig. 2H, i and ii).
To conﬁrm that results seen with BMDCs in response to
tumor growth and treatment are not simply related to tumor
proliferation rate, we measured the tumor proliferative
index using Ki67 staining. We see no statistically signiﬁcant
difference in early to late stages of tumor growth in Ki67
staining. Similarly, there is no statistically signiﬁcant change
in Ki67 positivity following radiotherapy, unless used at
higher than clinically relevant doses (3  5 Gy; Supplementary Fig. S1).

BMDCs differentiate to form distinct cell types
Concordant with previous reports by Kozin and colleagues,
we found that the majority of BMDCs recruited to the tumor
showed a predominantly inﬂammatory and microglial phenotype, in both xenograft and transgenic GBMs (Fig. 3A–C;
refs. 21, 22). Approximately 80% of the recruited BMDCs in
untreated and radiotherapy GBMs are MAC3þ, CD11bþ, and
IBA1þ (Fig. 3D). We found that 70% of cells expressing IBA1þ
were RFPþBMDCs, indicating that they are not resident
inﬂammatory/microglial cells in the brain, but rather
recruited from the bone marrow, suggesting that local
microglia are either not activated or sufﬁcient to provide
a response to GBM growth (Fig. 3E). Majority of the bone
marrow–derived IBA1þ cells take on a perivascular localization. We also found a subpopulation of BMDCs, which
could be characterized as Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEM;
Tie2þ CD11bþ), which have been shown previously to be
involved in tumor progression (Fig. 3F; refs. 22, 23). We
found no evidence of BMDCs differentiating to other potential cell types, such as ﬁbroblasts (reticulin), glial cells (glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein), and neurons (TUJ1) in any stage of
tumor growth. Furthermore, we did not ﬁnd any new cell
types into which BMDCs differentiate in response to radiotherapy or temozolomide.
Role of bone marrow–derived inﬂammatory cells
We explored the potential role of the bone marrow–derived
macrophages (MAC3þ, CD11bþ) and microglial/inﬂammatory
cells (IBA1þ) as scavengers in GBMs through analysis of Zstack images of bone marrow–derived inﬂammatory cells that
were engulﬁng GBM tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A–
S2F). Approximately 10% of the three cell types are involved in
scavenging tumor cells, with the percentage of scavenging
MAC3þ and CD11bþ cells signiﬁcantly increasing following
radiotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S2G). There was no evidence
of BMDCs scavenging endothelial cells. All bone marrow–
derived cells that are seen scavenging GBM tumor cells are
seen only in the GBM microenvironment and not in perivascular niches, suggesting that pBMDCs have a distinct vascular
supportive role. Previous published data support the described
phagocytic activity of microglia and immune cells in GBMs.
Hussain and colleagues showed that puriﬁed glioma-inﬁltrating microglia have the ability to phagocytose and play a
cytotoxic role in the microenvironment (24). In vitro assays
have demonstrated the ability of glioma cells to deﬁne the
response of many immune cells and their ability to phagocytose glioma cells (25–27).
Contribution of BMDCs to GBM vasculature
Using in vivo 2PLM analysis complemented with IHC and IF,
we sought to deﬁnitively establish whether pBMDCs differentiate to form endothelial cells (CD31 and factor-VIII/vWF) or
smooth muscle cells (aSMA, Ang1, PDGFRb). Intravenous
injection of CD31þ antibody allowed speciﬁc in vivo identiﬁcation of mature vessel endothelial cells on 2PLM images. Indepth analysis of pBMDCs and their relationship to the vessel
wall and speciﬁcally the endothelial cells is possible through
use of time lapse footage (Supplementary Video S1) and z-stack

however, no difference was seen. The majority of pBMDCs
show macrophage and microglial differentiation (Fig. 4B, iii).
This similar pattern is evident in the transgenic mouse model

Tumor region–dependent association of BMDCs to GBM
vasculature
BMDCs demonstrated a distinct regional pattern of association with the vasculature, where peripheral and central
vessels show a differential association of pBMDCs. We
deﬁned the periphery of the tumor as the region between
tumor and normal brain within 300 mm of nonneoplastic
brain in both xenografts and transgenic models of GBMs
(Figs. 5A and 1D). We quantiﬁed the extent of pBMDCs
associated with the vasculature in the center versus periphery of GBMs at early stages (<7 days) when tumor volume,
based on volumetric MRI analysis, is less than 1 mm3 and at

late (>14 days) stages of tumor growth when tumor volume
exceeds 1 mm3. At early stages of GBM growth, pBMDCs
were detected in 60% to 80% of the vasculature throughout
all regions of the tumor, with no distinguishable difference
between center and periphery or small and large vessels
(Fig. 5B, i, ii, and C), whereas in late stages of tumor growth,
the vessels in center have less than 10% association with
pBMDCs (Fig. 5B, iii and C). In late stages of tumor growth,
peripheral vessels continued to show approximately 80% to
90% association of pBMDCs (Fig. 5B, iv and C). This similar
regional association of pBMDCs was evident in the RASB8
model (Fig. 5D, i and ii).
Given the distinct region-dependent pattern of association of pBMDCs, we aimed to establish the quantitative PCR
expression proﬁle of key angiogenic factors of the vasculature, including the perivascular niche, isolated by LCM from
the center and periphery of both early- and late-stage GBMs,

Ang1 was the only factor to remain undetermined, low, in all
samples when compared with the control (Fig. 5E). Human
Ang2 decreased signiﬁcantly in both central and peripheral
vasculature in response to tumor growth (Fig. 5E, i), whereas
mouse Ang2 increased signiﬁcantly in only the peripheral
vessels (Fig. 5E, ii). Human Tie2 did not change in response
to tumor growth (Fig. 5E, i), a result that was expected as
Tie2 is considered to be endothelial cell-speciﬁc and derived
from host (mouse) vasculature. Similarly, there was a signiﬁcant increase in mouse Tie2 in peripheral vessels in
response to GBM growth (Fig. 5E, ii).
Region-dependent association of BMDCs in response to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy
In response to temozolomide, the region-dependent association of pBMDCs was not changed compared with untreated
tumors. However, following radiotherapy, there was an inﬂux
of pBMDCs to the central vessels. There remained no evidence
of pBMDC differentiation into endothelial cells or de novo

vessel formation in response to radiotherapy (Fig. 6A). Following radiotherapy, there is a statistically signiﬁcant increase
in number of central vessels that had associated pBMDCs (Fig.
6A, iii and B). The loss of regional association of pBMDCs
cannot be simply explained by a decrease in GBM tumor
volume as a consequence of radiotherapy as the effect is seen
immediately upon radiotherapy treatment and sustained until
GBM reoccurrence.
In response to radiotherapy, there was a pronounced change
in expression proﬁle of angiogenic factors in central and
peripheral vasculature as determined by real-time PCR. There
is an increase in mouse Ang2 in central vessels with radiotherapy (Fig. 6C, ii) and a signiﬁcant decrease in both human
and mouse Tie2 in peripheral vessels (Fig. 6C, i and ii). PCR of
angiogenic factors on systemic bone marrow shows an
increase in expression of mouse Ang2 but not Ang1 in response
to radiotherapy (Fig. 6D). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed an
increase in Ang2 but not Ang1 protein expression by bone
marrow in response to radiotherapy (Fig. 6E). IF analysis
conﬁrmed an upregulation of Ang2 protein expression, seen

Figure 6. Loss of region-dependent localization of BMDCs following radiotherapy. A, ex vivo IF images of GBM intracranial xenografts treated with

Untreated late tumors demonstrate minimal BMDC recruitment to central vessels (i), while periphery recruitment is high (ii). Following radiotherapy
þ
(3  2 Gy), pBMDCs are seen in the tumor center and are evident in the perivascular niche (iii) as well as in the tumor periphery (iv; GFP BMDC, green;

association of pBMDCs in response to radiotherapy (3  2 Gy) within the center (  , P ¼ 0.001) and the periphery ( , P ¼ 0.0045). Data represent

undetermined and presumed low in all samples. Data represent mean  SEM, n ¼ 5, in triplicate. D, real-time PCR data conﬁrm an increase in
mouse Ang2 in response to radiotherapy (6 Gy). E, Western blot analysis also shows an increase in mouse Ang2 expression by BMDCs with exposure to
radiotherapy (6 Gy). F, ex vivo IF analysis also veriﬁes an upregulation of Ang2 expression seen predominantly on tumor vasculature in response to

radiotherapy. The increase in Ang2 is associated with an increased colocalization of Ang2 to pBMDCs (white arrowhead; GFP BMDC, green;

factor in regulating GBM neovascularization. We inhibited
VEGF using doxycycline-inducible expression of VEGFTrap
(29, 30) in U87 or GSC GBM intracranial xenografts. The
blockade of VEGF through VEGFTrap activation leads to an
increase in invasiveness of the cells at the tumor border (Fig.
7A), a characteristic previously described by Paez-Ribes and

predominantly in tumor vasculature and colocalized to
pBMDCs, in response to radiotherapy (Fig. 6F and G).

colleagues (31). In addition, the loss of VEGF was able to
decrease the microvascular density and increase vessel diameter similar to that previously seen by Chae and colleagues (32)
(Fig. 7B–D). VEGF inhibition did not change the levels of
recruitment and migration of BMDCs to GBMs but did result
in a clear loss of the region-dependent association of pBMDCs
mirroring the effect of radiotherapy (Fig. 7E and F). Discontinuation of VEGFTrap resulted in tumor recurrence and
restoration of the regional association of pBMDCs and loss
of pBMDCs in the central vasculature in GBM xenografts.
These results implicate VEGF as a key molecular regulator
in triggering the regional association of pBMDCs in GBM
vasculature.
In response to VEGF inhibition, there was a signiﬁcant
increase in human Ang2 and Ang1 in central vasculature (Fig.
7G, i) together with elevated mouse Tie2 (Fig. 7G, ii). The
addition of radiotherapy concomitantly with VEGF inhibition
did not enhance the response or angiogenic proﬁle beyond
VEGF inhibition alone.
Following addition of AMG386, a therapeutically potent
ANG1/2 inhibitor, the inﬂux of pBMDCs to central vasculature
seen following radiotherapy or VEGFTrap is lost. In tumors,
treated AMG386 and radiotherapy or AMG386 and VEGFTrap
pBMDC are seen associated with the peripheral vessels, whereas there is minimal pBMDC seen in the central vessels. These
ﬁndings lend further support to the proposal that a compensatory upregulation of ANG2 following loss of VEGF (either
indirectly through radiotherapy or directly through VEGF
inhibition) is a potential driver for pBMDC recruitment following therapy (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
Emerging evidence suggests that de novo vessel formation or
vasculogenesis can occur in adult life, and it has been argued to
provide a potential mechanism for cancer neovascularization,
through mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from the
bone marrow or circulation (12, 33–36). This hypothesis
remains highly controversial with debate as to whether BMDCs
actually differentiate to directly form endothelial cells or
instead contribute a more supportive role to neovascularization in a paracrine manner (10, 21).
In this study, we take advantage of real-time in vivo 2PLM
imaging to demonstrate that BMDCs do not differentiate to
form endothelial cells at any stage of GBM growth, regardless of
tumor region, stage of tumor growth, or model investigated.
Moreover, we see no evidence of true vasculogenesis occurring
by BMDCs at any stage of GBM growth; speciﬁcally, no bone
marrow–derived vessels or vascular channels were evident in
the GBM models. Our results are in keeping with previous
studies that have also reported that BMDCs do not incorporate
into the tumor vasculature as endothelial cells (21, 37). In our
study, the majority of BMDCs remain on the outer lumen of
vascular channels throughout all stages of GBM growth in a
perivascular niche.
We identiﬁed a very distinct region-dependent association
of pBMDCs with GBM vasculature in response to tumor
growth. At early stages of GBM formation, there is no regional

www.aacrjournals.org

variation in association of pBMDCs with the vasculature, with
equal distribution of pBMDCs seen in peripheral and central
vessels. However, at later stages of tumor growth, pBMDCs
remain intimately associated with the peripheral vasculature
and show minimal to no association with central vasculature.
The region-dependent localization of pBMDCs suggests that
beyond a critical tumor volume, GBMs rely on distinct molecular mechanisms of neovascularization in peripheral versus
central regions of GBMs.
It is established that host vessel co-option is the principle
mechanism of GBM vascularization at early stages of GBM
growth. At this stage of GBM formation, Ang2 is known to be
the earliest angiogenic factor to be upregulated (1). Ang2 has
previously been shown to promote recruitment of a speciﬁc
CD11bþ subtype of BMDCs (37–39). Here, we show that at early
stages of GBMs, growth there is a signiﬁcant recruitment of
pBMDCs to GBM vasculature that continues throughout all
stages of GBM growth in the peripheral vessels. Associated
with this, there is an upregulation of Ang2 by the host vasculature, as the source of Ang2 is mouse and not human,
suggesting that elevated levels of Ang2 are created as a
consequence of host vessel destabilization that is needed for
vessel co-option to take place and this most likely involves
pBMDCs as suggested by their constant presence in the
peripheral GBM vessels.
VEGF is recognized as the central angiogenic factor that
regulates neovascularization, through angiogenesis or
branching of pre-existing vessels in cancer (1, 17, 40, 41).
GBMs have one of the highest levels of VEGF expression of
all cancer cells, in particular in pseudopalisading proliferative cells (6, 42), thereby creating a VEGF concentration
gradient, highest in central tumor regions and dissipating
through peripheral regions and the adjacent normal brain
(43, 44). At late stages of GBM growth, we show that there is
minimal association of pBMDCs. Along with this observation, we ﬁnd that there is minimal Ang2 or Tie2 upregulation
in central vessels. Taken together, these results suggest that
with high levels of VEGF, the central vasculature in GBMs
does not depend on pBMDCs for tumor neovascularization
and similarly the Ang2/Tie2 pathway is not involved in
maintaining the GBM central vasculature. However, with
inhibition of VEGF, there is a distinct loss of the regiondependent association of pBMDCs as evidenced by association of pBMDCs in central vasculature of VEGFTrap-treated tumors. In addition, with loss of central VEGF, there is an
upregulation of Ang2/Tie2 in the central GBM vasculature,
which supports a central role for Ang2 in signaling recruitment of pBMDCs. Furthermore, we show that bone marrow
cells themselves provide a source of Ang2, potentially to
ensure that a continuous and sufﬁcient supply of pBMDCs is
available to promote neovascularization and protection of
newly formed tumor vasculature.
Previous studies show that there is an inﬂux of BMDCs
into GBMs following radiotherapy to facilitate new vessel
formation, thereby providing a mechanism through which
GBMs can revascularize (21, 37). In this study, we also see an
inﬂux of BMDCs, and furthermore, we demonstrate that
there is a clear loss of the regional association of pBMDCs in

GBM vasculature following radiotherapy. We propose that
following radiotherapy, with the loss of central GBM tumor
cells, there is a loss of the primary source of VEGF and
overall decrease in VEGF production in the tumor center
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In turn, we ﬁnd that radiotherapy
results in an increase in Ang2 and Tie2 in the central vessels,
compared with untreated GBMs. Once again, it appears that
the upregulation of Ang2 signals recruitment of pBMDCs to
support, remodel, and restore the vulnerable central vasculature, following radiotherapy. Concurrent with elevated
Ang2, we see no increase in Ang1 following radiotherapy, either on the central vasculature or by the systemic
BM. Ang1 is known to provide a stabilizing force on the
vasculature, preventing vascular remodeling. Absence of
Ang1 upregulation is necessary to allow Ang2-induced vascular remodeling of central vessels to occur following
radiotherapy.
Recruitment of pBMDCs is associated with an upregulation of ANG2 that is seen with VEGF inhibition, either
directly with use of VEGFTrap or indirectly following radiotherapy. We show that blocking ANG2 in turn prevents
inﬂux of pBMDC into the central vessels following therapy,
lending support to the proposal that an interplay between
ANG2 and VEGF is central to the regional association of
pBMDC.
We established that approximately 80% of BMDCs in the
GBM microenvironment are inﬂammatory cells: macrophages and microglia. The majority of inﬂammatory cell
population in GBM are bone marrow–derived and not
resident brain cells, suggesting that the normal resident
brain inﬂammatory response is not sufﬁcient to meet the
demands, of either host or cancer cell, to respond to GBM
growth. At any given stage of GBM growth, only 10% to 20%
of BMDC in the tumor microenvironment, and not in
perivascular niche, provide a scavenging role as activated
anti-inﬂammatory cells directed against the cancer cells.
The remaining BMDCs appear to provide alternate roles,
potentially tumor-protective roles, that is driven by cancer
cells to aid in their progression, and given their perivascular
localization, possibly tumor vascular protective roles. The
region-speciﬁc contribution of pBMDCs suggests that their
role varies with different stages of tumor growth and in
response to therapy. The literature supports a dual role for
macrophages in cancer.
In a recent study, Pyonteck and colleagues show that
inhibition of CSF-1 increases survival and GBM regression,
however, not through depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) but through 're-education' of TAM to M1-like
macrophages that display increased phagocytic properties.
This switch is thought to be cancer cell driven through
expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) and IFNg (45). In addition, most recently,
Casazza and colleagues have shown that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)
guides TAMs to hypoxic areas to elicit proangiogenic and
immunosuppressive functions (46). Our results placed in the
context of these recent studies would suggest a better
understanding of how these factors regulate the regional
association of pBMDCs and are important in being able to

design effective targeted treatments concurrent with current
standard therapy.
In conclusion, we demonstrate a distinct region-dependent
association of pBMDCs in GBM vasculature. We established
that BMDCs do not directly contribute to new vessel formation
either by differentiating into endothelial cells or creating
vascular channels in GBMs. Rather, pBMDCs provide a vascular supportive role, either contributing to vessel co-option in
peripheral regions or through facilitating restoration of vasculature following radiotherapy and antiangiogenic therapies
(VEGF inhibition). In central GBMs, where there is abundance
of proliferative and viable GBM tumor cells and high levels of
VEGF, pBMDCs are not needed to support the angiogenic
process that is required for tumor neovascularization. However, loss of VEGF, either through antiangiogenic therapies or
radiotherapy, results in vulnerable vasculature in the central
region, triggering an upregulation in Ang2, which in turn
triggers recruitment of pBMDCs to create a supportive vascular environment that allows restoration of the vulnerable
GBM vasculature and ultimately tumor survival. Conﬁrming
the central role of Ang2 in regional localization of pBMDCs is
our data that show that inhibition of Ang2, following loss of
VEGF, prevents inﬂux of pBMDCs in the central vasculature.
Therefore, targeting inﬂux of BMDCs, particularly pBMDCs,
concurrent with radiotherapy and VEGF inhibition, can potentially offer a novel strategy for preventing GBM recurrence
following therapy.
