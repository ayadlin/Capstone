BACKGROUND: Novel therapies are needed to improve outcomes in T-cell lymphomas. The authors report the interim
results of a prospective multicenter trial evaluating lenalidomide in T-cell lymphomas. METHODS: Patients with recurrent and refractory T-cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides and untreated patients ineligible for combination
chemotherapy were prescribed oral lenalidomide (25 mg daily) on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response rate. Secondary endpoints were
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. The 2-stage design allows for up to 40 patients.
RESULTS: At the time of this interim analysis, 24 patients were enrolled in this study, and 23 were evaluable for
response. The median age was 65 years. The overall response rate was 7 (30%) of 23; all were partial responses. Two
patients had stable disease for 5 cycles. Responses were seen in anaplastic, angioimmunoblastic, and peripheral Tcell unspecified histologies. Median PFS was 96 days (range, 8-696þ days). Median OS was 241 days (range, 8-696þ
days). The most common grade 4 adverse event was thrombocytopenia (33%). The most common grade 3 adverse
events were neutropenia (21%), febrile neutropenia (17%), and pain not otherwise specified (17%). Rash correlated
with response to therapy (P ¼.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent and refractory T-cell lymphomas, oral
lenalidomide monotherapy has clinical activity, and toxicity is consistent with the known safety profile of lenalidoC 2010 American Cancer

T-cell lymphomas are a diverse and often aggressive group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Most subtypes of T-cell lymphoma are derived from mature T cells and are collectively called peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs). This group of
aggressive T-cell lymphomas is characterized by biological diversity, relative rarity of the disease, and a poor clinical prognosis. Conventional chemotherapy provides 5-year survival in the range of 30% or less for most types of PTCL.1-7 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has proven to be an exception, with significantly
longer survival than other forms of PTCL.8-10 The tendency of PTCL to recur has prompted several studies into highdose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant for recurrent and refractory disease. In general, these studies have found that
long-term survival remains in the range of 40% for chemosensitive disease, with predictably better survival in ALCL.11-14
The prognosis for patients with T-cell lymphomas that are either ineligible for or have developed disease recurrence after
high-dose chemotherapy remains poor.14,15 Novel therapeutic approaches are needed to further improve outcomes in Tcell lymphomas.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is an immunomodulatory agent that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in several hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide has several hypothesized mechanisms of action, including direct cytotoxicity to tumor
cells,16-18 and immunomodulatory effects such as cytokine modulation19 and enhanced natural killer and T-cell function.20,21 In addition, lenalidomide alters the tumor cell microenvironment to discourage the growth of tumor cells and

Lenalidomide has proven efficacy in the treatment
of several hematologic malignancies, including chronic
lymphocytic leukemia,26 multiple myeloma,27 and myelodysplastic syndrome.28,29 Preliminary results of a phase
2 trial of lenalidomide in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
have shown clinical activity,30 and a phase 2 trial has
recently demonstrated clinical activity of lenalidomide
monotherapy in recurrent or refractory aggressive B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.31 We report the interim results
of a prospective phase 2 multicenter trial evaluating the
safety and efficacy of oral lenalidomide monotherapy in
recurrent and refractory noncutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study was designed in accordance with the general
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Key inclusion criteria were age 18 years, histologically proven T-cell lymphoma (excluding cutaneous Tcell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides), with recurrent/refractory disease after at least 1 line of chemotherapy or
untreated patients with contraindications to chemotherapy (no restriction on number of prior therapies), allowing prior radiotherapy or autologous or allogeneic stem
cell transplant, at least 1 measurable lesion 2 cm on
imaging or clinical examination, World Health Organization performance status of 2 at study entry, absolute
neutrophil count 1.0  109/L, platelet count 75 
109/L, serum creatinine 200 lM/L, total bilirubin 2
 the upper limit of normal, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 2  the upper limit of
normal or 5  the upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases are present. Women of childbearing potential
must have had a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
within 10 to 14 days and again within 24 hours of starting
study drug. In addition, sexually active women of childbearing potential must have agreed to additional pregnancy testing throughout the study and to commit to
continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or
begin 2 acceptable methods of birth control 4 weeks
before initiation of study drug, during therapy and any
breaks in therapy, and for 4 weeks after the last dose of
study drug. Men must have agreed not to father a child
and to use a condom with partners of child-bearing poten-

tial even after successful vasectomy. Key exclusion criteria
are cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides histologies, pregnant or lactating women, the development of
erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating
rash while taking thalidomide or similar drugs, and any
prior use of lenalidomide.
Study Design
This open-label, single-arm, multicenter Canadian phase
2 clinical trial was designed to assess the overall response
rate (ORR) to lenalidomide for patients with T-cell lymphoma. The primary endpoint is ORR as defined using
the International Working Lymphoma Response Criteria.32 The secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), and safety.
Patients were treated with oral lenalidomide (25 mg
once daily) on Days 1 to 21 of every 28-day cycle. Treatment was continued until there was evidence of progressive disease, intolerable side effects, patient choice to
withdraw, or death. Administration of lenalidomide was
instructed to be in the morning, at approximately the
same time each day. Patients were provided with enough
lenalidomide for each 21-day cycle. Patients were
instructed to maintain a diary to record drug administration, and were asked to bring any unused study drug to
the research center at their next visit. Research personnel
recorded the number of used and unused study drug capsules at each visit, to document treatment compliance.
Dose modifications were predefined and followed
by the treating physician. These include dose modifications for grade 3 neutropenia associated with a fever, grade
4 neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, grade 3
nondesquamating rash, grade 2 sinus bradycardia or other
cardiac arrhythmias, grade 2 or 3 allergic reaction, grade
3 venous thrombosis/embolism, hyperthyroidism or
hypothyroidism, and any other grade 3 nonhematologic
toxicity assessed as lenalidomide related. Lenalidomide
treatment was discontinued for any grade desquamating
rash, grade 4 nondesquamating rash, grade 3 sinus bradycardia or other cardiac arrhythmias, or grade 4 allergic
reaction.
Supportive care and concomitant therapy, including
transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics,
antiemetics, erythropoietic agents, and filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), were allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Concomitant use of
sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and other anticancer therapies, including radiation, thalidomide, or other investigational agents, was not

permitted. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy
within 28 days of baseline was prohibited. Corticosteroid
use was allowed in palliative doses (maximum dose, dexamethasone 4 mg orally 4 daily or equivalent) to treat
nausea or peritumoral edema; however, corticosteroid use
in higher doses or as an antineoplastic agent was prohibited. Prophylactic anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy
was not required on study, but consideration was given as
deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

ments were clinically indicated. Serum thyroid function
tests were performed at screening, at the end of Cycle 3,
and every 3 cycles thereafter. For women of child-bearing
potential, a pregnancy urine or serum test was done 10 to
14 days prior and again within 24 hours of initiation of
therapy. In this population, pregnancy testing was
repeated weekly for the first 4 weeks, then monthly if
menstruation was regular or every 2 weeks if it was
irregular.

Response and Safety Assessments
Study visits were performed on Day 1 of every 28-day
cycle of treatment. Target and nontarget lesions were
assessed by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, and every 3 treatment cycles
thereafter. Bone marrow core biopsy was repeated only to
confirm a complete remission, and only if the pretreatment bone marrow biopsy showed evidence of lymphoma. Response and progression were evaluated using
the International Working Lymphoma Response Criteria.32 Patients who discontinued treatment for any reason
were followed for toxicity for at least 30 days, and underwent a safety assessment approximately 30 days after the
last dose of study drug. In addition, off study evaluations
were performed every 3 months to obtain follow-up data
on PFS and OS.
Safety evaluations included adverse events, vital
signs, and hematology and serum chemistry profiles every
28 days. Hematology profiles were done weekly during
Cycle 1, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 2 and 3, and then on
Day 1 of subsequent cycles unless more frequent assess-

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint is the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients assessable for response whose best
response was either a partial response (PR) or a complete
response (CR). Secondary endpoints are PFS, OS, and the
incidence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologic
toxicities as defined by the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 3.0.
The study has a 2-stage design, with a goal of enrolling a total of 40 patients. Stage 1 has accrued 22 patients,
and the remainder continue to be enrolled in stage 2. The
alpha level of the design is .04, and the power is 0.9. If <4
of 40 patients responded, this trial was to be considered

studied.
Response rates and the occurrence of grade 3-4 toxicities are expressed as percentages. Kaplan-Meier curves
are used to characterize OS (Fig. 1) and PFS (Fig. 2). Categorical variables are compared using Fisher exact test.

performance status was 0-1 (n ¼ 15), 2 (n ¼ 7), and 3
(n ¼ 2). The histology was PTCL unspecified (n ¼ 10),
angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (n ¼ 7), anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (n ¼ 5), enteropathic T-cell lymphoma
(n ¼ 1), and hepatosplenic gamma/delta lymphoma
(n ¼ 1). The median time from the completion of previous therapy to initiation of lenalidomide was 8 months
(range, 1-48 months). The median number of prior therapies was 1 (range, 0-4). Twenty (83%) patients had
received at least 1 prior treatment with combination
chemotherapy, 3 (12%) had undergone prior stem cell
transplantation, and 5 (21%) were refractory to their last
therapy. Four patients were previously untreated and, in
the opinion of the treating physician investigator, not candidates for combination chemotherapy.

RESULTS

Safety
The most common adverse events were fatigue, gastrointestinal, and hematological. Table 2 summarizes all
adverse events reported in 10 % of patients. The most
common grade 4 adverse event was thrombocytopenia
(33%), and the most common grade 3 adverse events were
neutropenia (21%), febrile neutropenia (17%), pain not
otherwise specified (17%), dyspnea (13%), muscle weakness (13%), and pneumonitis (13%). Table 3 summarizes
all grade 3 and 4 adverse events.
Four (17%) patients underwent a total of 6 dose
reductions. Three dose reductions were for neutropenia, 1
was for febrile neutropenia, 1 was for diarrhea, and 1 was
for a generalized maculopapular rash. The patient dose
reduced because of a rash was subsequently titrated back
up to full dose without further dose reductions required.
Reasons for discontinuing therapy on study were
disease progression (n ¼ 11), death (n ¼ 6), and intolerance (n ¼ 4). At current assessment, 3 patients are still on
treatment.
Fourteen patients have died on study to date, 8 of
whom died after discontinuing lenalidomide. Eleven
deaths were attributed to disease progression. Two
patients died of infection, 1 of pneumonia on Cycle 1 and
the other of a lung abscess on Cycle 3. One remaining
death was attributed to a small bowel obstruction complicated by perforation.

Patient Baseline Characteristics
From September 2006 to November 2008, at the time of
this interim analysis, 24 patients were enrolled at 5 centers
in Canada. Patient demographics and baseline disease

evaluation at the time of the analysis. The ORR was 7 of
23 (30%; Table 4). All 7 responders achieved a PR
(PR ¼ 30%), no patients achieved a CR, and 2 patients
had stable disease (SD) for 5 cycles. The median OS
(OS) was 241 days (range, 8-696þ days). The median
PFS was 96 days (range, 8-696 days). Among the 9
patients with SD or better, median time on treatment was
172 days, median PFS was 168 days, and median OS has
not yet been reached with 241 to 696 days of follow-up.
Mean time to response was 65 days (range, 29-87 days).
Histologic subtypes found to achieve objective responses
were anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ORR, 40%),
angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (ORR, 29%), and
PTCL unspecified (ORR, 33%). Patients who responded
to lenalidomide treatment had a median of 1 prior line of
treatment (range, 0-3), with no previously transplanted
patients responding to treatment. Two of the responders
had been refractory to their last treatment before lenalidomide. The median Ann Arbor stage of responders was
stage 4 at enrollment (range, 1-4).
The development of a skin rash was common among
patients responding to treatment. Of the 6 patients in this
trial who developed a rash (grade 1, n ¼ 3; grade 2, n ¼ 2;
grade 3, n ¼ 1), 5 achieved a PR. In every case, the rash
developed during the first cycle of lenalidomide treatment. The sixth patient who developed a rash did so in
the second cycle of treatment and achieved SD, which

continues at the time of this analysis after 24 cycles of
treatment. Two patients with no rash responded to treatment, both achieving a PR. Fisher exact test was used to
assess the relationship of rash to treatment response, and
the results suggest a significant relationship (P ¼ .003).
Several other baseline patient characteristics were
assessed in relation to treatment response. None of the
variables analyzed correlated with response, including age
60 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status <2, Ann Arbor stage 1 or 2, histology
subtype, time from completion of prior therapy to the
start of lenalidomide 3 months, and number of lines of
therapy before lenalidomide <2.
Two patients achieved SD. The first of these patients
had SD for 5 cycles before disease progression. This
patient had received 1 prior treatment regimen with
CHOP (Cytoxan, hydroxyrubicin, Oncovin, prednisone)
chemotherapy. The second patient remains on lenalidomide therapy after 24 cycles and has achieved SD. This
patient had received multiple prior treatment regimens,
including systemic prednisone, CHOP chemotherapy,
prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine, and
weekly systemic methotrexate. Both of these patients have
PTCL unspecified histology and had stage 4 disease at
enrollment.

DISCUSSION
The response rates of oral lenalidomide monotherapy in
T-cell lymphoma are comparable to those of other monotherapies previously tested. The nucleoside analogue gemcitabine has shown efficacy in phase 2 trials in recurrent
and refractory T-cell lymphomas with CR rates of 8% to
20% and ORR of 60% to 69%.33,34 The CR rate of the
histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin was 8% and the
ORR 30% in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and refractory
PTCL.35 Another phase 2 study in a similar group of noncutaneous T-cell lymphomas found denileukin diftitox,
an interleukin-2–diphtheria toxin fusion protein, to have
a CR rate of 22% and an ORR of 48%.36 Recently, a CR
rate of 12% and an ORR of 35% have been described for
lenalidomide monotherapy in aggressive B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma.31 Although lenalidomide therapy in
the current interim analysis has not resulted in CR, small
patient numbers in the studies discussed make direct comparison difficult. Strategic combinations of lenalidomide
with agents shown to achieve CRs may further improve
responses while capitalizing on complementary mechanisms of action.
The results demonstrate a marked difference in outcome between responders and nonresponders in this
study. Given the design limitations of a phase 2 trial, we
cannot conclude whether the improved outcome seen in
responders is because of favorable underlying disease biology or the treatment. However, it is possible that lenalidomide may have provided meaningful palliation of T-cell
lymphoma for a subset of patients in this study.
With a median number of 1 prior therapy (range, 04), and only 12% of patients previously undergoing stem
cell transplant, the majority of patients enrolled in this
trial were clearly not felt to be well suited for aggressive
chemotherapy or stem cell transplant by their treating
physicians. Younger patients who had been treated
aggressively and whose disease was demonstrably refractory to multiple therapies including transplantation were

4546

not well represented in this trial. Effectively, this was a
study of palliative oral therapy in older, nontransplant
candidates.
The median time from diagnosis to lenalidomide
treatment is relatively short at 13 months, and the median
Ann Arbor stage at enrollment was stage IV (range, I-IV).
These patient characteristics may reflect both the tendency for T-cell lymphomas to recur after primary treatment, and the lack of standard and effective treatment
strategies in recurrent and refractory T-cell lymphoma.
Among patients responding to treatment, 2 were
Ann Arbor stage I or II, and 5 were stage III or IV. It is
encouraging that responses were seen among 2 patients
who were refractory to their prior therapy.
A relationship between response to lenalidomide
and the development of a skin rash is suggested by the
results. Single-agent lenalidomide has been reported to
cause rash in about 30% of patients in various studies.31,37-39 To our knowledge, rash has not previously
been reported as predictive of response to lenalidomide
treatment in other hematological malignancies. The early
onset of rash among responders in this study is intriguing,
and suggests that rash could be an early predictor of
response. The first month of treatment with lenalidomide
has previously been identified as the most common time
of rash onset in general among multiple myeloma and amyloidosis patients.37 The mechanism of lenalidomideinduced rash remains unclear. Characteristic rashes have
been found with other agents, such as erlotinib and cetuximab when treating various solid malignancies, and in
some cases the severity of rash has been associated with
improved survival.40,41
Lenalidomide has proven to be a well-tolerated
drug, with clinical efficacy in a variety of malignancies
both as monotherapy and in combination. It has an acceptable safety profile alone or when combined with a
variety of other agents, including dexamethasone,27 melphalan,42 and rituximab.43 Lenalidomide, by virtue of its

oral dosing and tolerable side effect profile, also lends
itself to the setting of maintenance therapy after remission
induction, and its use in this fashion is being actively
investigated. Further investigations therefore are warranted within this indication.
