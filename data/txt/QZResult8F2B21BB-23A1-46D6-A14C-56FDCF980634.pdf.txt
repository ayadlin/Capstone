Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Many stem, progenitor and cancer cells undergo periods of mitotic quiescence from which they
can be reactivated1-5. The signals triggering entry into and exit from this reversible dormant state
are not well understood. In the developing Drosophila central nervous system (CNS), multipotent
self-renewing progenitors called neuroblasts6-9 undergo quiescence in a stereotypical
spatiotemporal pattern10. Entry into quiescence is regulated by Hox proteins and an internal
neuroblast timer11-13. Exit from quiescence (reactivation) is subject to a nutritional checkpoint
requiring dietary amino acids14. Organ co-cultures also implicate an unidentified signal from an
adipose/hepatic-like tissue called fat body14. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that Slimfast
amino-acid sensing and Target-of-Rapamycin (TOR) signalling15 activate a fat-body derived
signal (FDS) required for neuroblast reactivation. Downstream of the FDS, Insulin-like receptor
(InR) signalling and the Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/TOR network are required in
neuroblasts for exit from quiescence. We demonstrate that nutritionally regulated glial cells
provide the source of Insulin-like Peptides (Ilps) relevant for timely neuroblast reactivation but not
for overall larval growth. Conversely, Ilps secreted into the hemolymph by median neurosecretory
cells (mNSCs) systemically control organismal size16-18 but do not reactivate neuroblasts.
Drosophila thus contains two segregated Ilp pools, one regulating proliferation within the CNS
and the other controlling tissue growth systemically. Together, our findings support a model in
which amino acids trigger the cell cycle re-entry of neural progenitors via a fat
body→glia→neuroblasts relay. This mechanism highlights that dietary nutrients and remote
organs, as well as local niches, are key regulators of transitions in stem-cell behaviour.
In fed larvae, Drosophila neuroblasts (Fig. 1a) exit quiescence from the late first instar (L1)
stage onwards. This reactivation involves cell enlargement and entry into S-phase,
monitored in this study using the thymidine analogue, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU).
Consistent with a previous study10, we observed that reactivated neuroblast lineages
(neuroblasts and their progeny, Fig 1b) reproducibly incorporated EdU in a characteristic
spatiotemporal sequence: central brain (CB) → thoracic (Th) → abdominal (Ab)
neuromeres (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Mushroom-body neuroblasts (MB NBs) and
one ventrolateral neuroblast, however, are known not to undergo quiescence and to continue
dividing for several days in the absence of dietary amino acids14 (Fig. 1a,c,f). This indicates
that dietary amino acids are more than mere “fuel”, providing a specific signal that
reactivates neuroblasts. However, explanted CNSs incubated with amino acids do not

undergo neuroblast reactivation unless co-cultured with fat body from larvae raised on a diet
containing amino acids14. We therefore tested the in vivo requirement for a fat-body derived
signal (FDS) in neuroblast reactivation by blocking vesicular trafficking and thus signalling
from this organ using a dominant-negative Shibire Dynamin (ShiDN). This strongly reduced
EdU neuroblast incorporation, indicating that exit from quiescence in vivo requires a FDS
(Fig. 1d,e). One candidate we tested was Ilp6, known to be expressed by the fat body19, 20,
but neither fat-body specific overexpression nor RNA interference of this gene significantly
affected neuroblast reactivation (Supplementary Table 1 and data not shown). Fat body cells
are known to sense amino acids via the cationic amino-acid transporter Slimfast (Slif),
which activates the TOR signalling pathway, in turn leading to the production of a systemic
growth signal15, 21. We found that fat-body specific overexpression of the TOR activator,
Ras Homologue Enriched in Brain (Rheb) or of an activated form of the p110 PI3K catalytic
subunit, or of the p60 adaptor subunit, had no significant effect on neuroblast reactivation in
fed animals or in larvae raised on a nutrient-restricted (NR) diet lacking amino-acids (Fig.
1e,f and data not shown). In contrast, global inactivation of Tor, fat-body specific Slif
knockdown or fat-body specific expression of the TOR inhibitors Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/2) all strongly reduced neuroblasts from exiting quiescence (Fig.
1d,e). These results together show that a Slif/TOR-dependent FDS is required for
neuroblasts to exit quiescence and that this may be equivalent to the FDS known to regulate
larval growth.

We next investigated the signalling pathways essential within neuroblasts for their
reactivation. Nutrient-dependent growth is regulated in many species by the interconnected
TOR and PI3K pathways22-24 (Supplementary Fig. 2). In fed larvae, we found that
neuroblast inactivation of TOR signalling (by overexpression of TSC1/2), or PI3K
signalling (by overexpression of p60, the Phosphatase and Tensin homologue PTEN, the
Forkhead box subgroup O transcription factor FoxO or dominant-negative p110), all
inhibited reactivation (Fig. 1e). Conversely, stimulation of neuroblast TOR signalling (by
overexpression of Rheb) or PI3K signalling (by overexpression of activated p110 or
Phosphoinositide-Dependent Kinase 1, PDK1) triggered precocious exit from quiescence
(Fig. 1e). Rheb overexpression had a particularly early effect, preventing some neuroblasts
from undergoing quiescence even in newly hatched larvae (Supplementary Fig. 3). Hence,
TOR/PI3K signalling in neuroblasts is required to trigger their timely exit from quiescence.
Importantly, neuroblast overexpression of Rheb or activated p110 in NR larvae, which lack
FDS activity14, was sufficient to bypass the NR block to neuroblast reactivation (Fig. 1f).
Strikingly, both genetic manipulations were even sufficient to reactivate neuroblasts in
explanted CNSs, cultured without fat body or any other tissue (Fig. 1g). Together with the
previous results, this indicates that neuroblast TOR/PI3K signalling lies downstream of the
amino-acid dependent FDS during exit from quiescence.
To identify the mechanism bridging the FDS with neuroblast TOR/PI3K signalling, we
tested the role of the Insulin-like Receptor (InR, Supplementary Fig. 2). Importantly, a
dominant-negative InR inhibited neuroblast reactivation whereas an activated form
stimulated premature exit from quiescence (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, InR activation was
sufficient to bypass the NR block to neuroblast reactivation (Fig. 1f). This suggests that at
least one of the potential InR ligands, the seven Insulin-like peptides (Ilps), may be the
neuroblast reactivating signal(s). By testing various combinations of targeted Ilp null
alleles25 and genomic Ilp deficiencies25, 26, we found that neuroblast reactivation was
moderately delayed in larvae deficient for both Ilp2 and Ilp3 (Df[Ilps2-3]) or lacking Ilp6
activity (Fig. 2a). Stronger delays, as severe as those observed in InR31 mutants, were
observed in larvae simultaneously lacking the activities of Ilp2, Ilp3 and Ilp5
(Df[Ilps2-3],Ilp5) or Ilps1-5 (Df[Ilps1-5]) (Fig. 2a). Despite the developmental delay in
Df[Ilps1-5] animals25, 26, neuroblast reactivation eventually begins in the normal spatial

pattern albeit heterochronically, in larvae with L3 morphology (Fig. 2b, compare timeline
with Fig. 1c). Together, the genetic analysis shows that Ilps 2, 3, 5 and 6 regulate the timing
but not the spatial pattern of neuroblast exit from quiescence. However, as removal of some
Ilps can induce compensatory regulation of others25, the relative importance of each cannot
be assessed from loss-of-function studies alone.

Brain mNSCs (Fig. 1a) are an important source of Ilps, secreted into the hemolymph in an
FDS-dependent manner to regulate larval growth16-18, 21. They express Ilp1, Ilp2, Ilp3 and
Ilp5, although not all during the same development stages16-18. However, we found that
none of the seven Ilps could reactivate neuroblasts during NR when overexpressed in
mNSCs (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, increasing mNSC secretion using the NaChBac
sodium channel21 or altering mNSC size using PI3K inhibitors/activators, which in turn
alters body growth, did not significantly affect neuroblast reactivation under fed conditions
(Fig. 2a,c, Supplementary Fig. 1b and L. Cheng, A. Bailey, S. Leevers, T. Ragan, P. Driscoll
& A.P.G, submitted). Surprisingly, therefore, mNSCs are not the relevant Ilp source for
neuroblast reactivation. Nonetheless, Ilp3 and Ilp6 mRNAs were detected in the CNS cortex,
at the early L2 stage, in a domain distinct from the Ilp2+ mNSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Two different Ilp3-lacZ transgenes17 suggest that Ilp3 is expressed in some glia (Repo+
cells) and neurons (Elav+ cells). An Ilp6-GAL4 insertion (see Methods) suggests that Ilp6 is
also expressed in glia, including the cortex glia surrounding neuroblasts and the surface glia
of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) (Fig. 3a).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next assessed the ability of each of the seven Ilps to reactivate neuroblasts when
overexpressed in glia or in neurons (Supplementary Table 2). Pan-glial or pan-neuronal
overexpression of Ilp4, Ilp5 or Ilp6 led to precocious reactivation under fed conditions (Fig.
3b,c). Each of these manipulations also bypassed the NR block to neuroblast reactivation, as
did overexpression of Ilp2 in glia or in neurons, or Ilp3 in neurons (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Table 2). In all of these Ilp overexpressions, and even when Ilp6 was
expressed in the posterior Ultrabithorax (Ubx) domain (Fig. 3e), the temporal rather than the
spatial pattern of reactivation was affected. Importantly, experiments blocking cell
signalling with ShiDN indicate that glia rather than neurons are critical for neuroblast
reactivation (Fig. 4a,b). Interestingly, glial-specific overexpression of Ilps 3-6 did not
significantly alter larval mass (Fig. 2c). Thus, in contrast to mNSC-derived Ilps, glialderived Ilps promote CNS growth without affecting body growth.
Focusing on Ilp6, we used CNS explant cultures to demonstrate directly that glial
overexpression was sufficient to substitute for the FDS during neuroblast exit from
quiescence (Fig. 3d). In vivo, Ilp6 was sufficient to induce reactivation during NR when
overexpressed via its own promoter or specifically in cortex glia but not in the
subperineurial BBB glia, nor in many other CNS cells that we tested (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Table 1). Hence, cortex glia possess the appropriate processing machinery
and/or location to deliver reactivating Ilp6 to neuroblasts. Ilp6 mRNA is known to be uprather than down-regulated in the larval fat body during starvation19 and, accordingly, Ilp6GAL4 activity is increased in this tissue following NR (Fig. 4c). Conversely, we found that
Ilp6-GAL4 is strongly downregulated in CNS glia during NR (Fig. 4c). Thus, dietary
nutrients stimulate glia to express Ilp6 at the transcriptional level. Consistent with this, an
important transducer of nutrient signals, the TOR/PI3K network, is necessary and sufficient
in glia (but not in neurons) for neuroblast reactivation (Fig. 4a,b). Together, the genetic and
expression analyses indicate that nutritionally regulated glia relay the FDS to quiescent
neuroblasts via Ilps.
This study used an integrative physiology approach to identify the relay mechanism
regulating a nutritional checkpoint in neural progenitors. A central feature of the fat

body→glia→neuroblasts relay model is that glial Insulin signalling bridges the amino-acid/
TOR-dependent FDS with InR/PI3K/TOR signalling in neuroblasts (Fig. 4d). The
importance of glial Ilp signalling during neuroblast reactivation is also underscored by an
independent study, published while this work was under revision27. As TOR signalling is
also required in neuroblasts and glia, direct amino-acid sensing by these cell types may also
impinge upon the linear tissue relay. This would then constitute a feed-forward persistence
detector28, ensuring that neuroblasts exit quiescence only if high amino-acid levels are
sustained rather than transient. We also showed that the CNS “compartment” in which glial
Ilps promote growth is functionally isolated, perhaps by the blood-brain barrier, from the
systemic compartment where mNSC Ilps regulate the growth of other tissues. The existence
of two functionally separate Ilp pools may explain why bovine Insulin cannot reactivate
neuroblasts in CNS organ culture14, despite being able to activate Drosophila InR in vitro29.
Given that Insulin/PI3K/TOR signalling components are highly conserved between insects
and vertebrates, it will be important to address whether mammalian adipose or hepatic
tissues signal to glia and whether or not this involves an Insulin/IGF relay to CNS
progenitors. In this regard, it is intriguing that brain-specific overexpression of IGF1 can
stimulate cell-cycle re-entry of mammalian cortical neural progenitors30, suggesting
utilization of at least part of the mechanism identified here in Drosophila.

METHODS SUMMARY

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For GAL4/UAS experiments, animals were raised at 29 °C unless otherwise stated. Larvae
hatching within a 2 hr window were transferred to cornmeal food (5.9% Glucose, 6.6%
Cornmeal, 1.2% Baker's Yeast, 0.7% Agar in water) or NR medium (5% Sucrose, 1% Agar
in PBS) and further synchronised by selecting L2 larvae morphologically from an L1/L2
moulting population. For EdU experiments, dissected CNSs were incubated for 1 hr in 10
μM EdU/PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4 % Formaldehyde/PBS and Alexa Fluor azide detected
according to instructions (Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit, Invitrogen). CNS explants were
cultured on 8μm pore-size inserts in Schneider's medium-10% fetal calf serum, 2mM Lglutamine (Gibco) and 1x Pen Strep (Gibco)- in 24-well Transwell plates (Costar) in a
humidified chamber at 25 °C. For EdU quantifications, the “thoracic” region used
corresponds to the ventral nerve cord from the level of the brain-lobes down to A1/A2 (Fig.
1a). EdU+ voxels were quantified using Volocity (Improvision) from an average of 10 CNSs
per experimental genotype, normalized to controls processed in parallel (siblings or halfsiblings), using Leica SP5 scans (LAS AF software) with a 1.5 μm-step z-series. For larval
mass measurements, triplicates of ~50 wandering L3 male larvae per genotype were
transferred to pre-weighed microfuge tubes and wet weights determined using a Precisa XB
120A balance. For all histograms, error bars represent the s.e.m. and p values are from twotailed Student t-tests with equal sample variance. Further details can be found in full
Methods section.

METHODS
Rearing and staging of Drosophila larvae
To assist larval genotyping, lethal chromosomes were re-established over Dfd-YFP
balancers. For EdU experiments, crosses were performed in cages with grape-juice plates
(25% (v/v) grape-juice, 1.25% (w/v) sucrose, 2.5% (w/v) agar) supplemented with live yeast
paste. For GAL4/UAS experiments, larvae hatched within a 2 hr time-window were
transferred to our standard cornmeal food (5.9% w/v Glucose, 6.6% Cornmeal, 1.2% Baker's
Yeast, 0.7% Agar in water) or to NR medium (5% Sucrose, 1% Agar in PBS). Animals were
raised at 29 °C throughout, with the following exceptions due to lethality at high
temperature: tub-GAL80ts,Repo>shiDN and tub-GAL80ts,Repo>Ilp2 animals were raised at
25 °C during embryogenesis and 29 °C during larval development, other Ilp2

overexpressions were performed at 25 °C throughout. At the time of dissection,
development was further synchronised by selecting L2 animals morphologically from a
mixed L1/L2 moulting population. Df(3L)[Ilps2-3],Ilp5 and Df(3L)[Ilps1-5] animals
develop considerably slower than controls, so EdU-incorporation experiments utilized
morphological staging after the L1/L2 and L2/L3 moults. Co-expression of Dcr-2 was used
to enhance knockdown efficiency for the SlifANTI antisense EP allele. As absolute numbers
of reactivated neuroblasts can vary with small differences in temperature and humidity,
parallel control experiments were carried out for each genetic background (using the siblings
or half-siblings of experimental animals), rather than using a single control.

EdU detection, immunostaining, in situ hybridization and imaging
L1 and L2 tissues were immobilised on poly-L-Lysine-coated slides for all stainings, except
for CNS explants. For EdU experiments, dissected CNSs were incubated for 1 hr in 10 μM
EdU/PBS, fixed for 15 min in 4 % Formaldehyde/PBS, followed by detection of Alexa
Fluor azide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Click-iT EdU Imaging Kit,
Invitrogen) and washing in 0.1% Triton/PBS. Antibody staining and in situ hybridisation
were performed according to standard protocols. Primary antibodies used in this study were:
rabbit anti-β-Galactosidase (Molecular Probes) 1/2000; rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen) 1/1000;
mouse anti-Repo 1/20; mouse anti-Miranda 1/20 and rat anti-Elav 1/100 (Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank); pre-adsorbed Alkaline Phosphatase-conjugated sheep antiDigoxigenin 1/2000. Secondary antibodies used were: F(ab′)2 fragments conjugated to
either Alexa-Fluor-488, Alexa-Fluor-633 (Molecular Probes) or Cy3 (Jackson), used at
1/250-1/2000. Live tissues were photographed in PBS. Fixed tissues labeled for fluorescence
microscopy were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) whereas those processed for
in situ hybridisation were mounted in 80% Glycerol. Fluorescent images were acquired with
a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (LAS AF software) and bright-field images were acquired
with a Zeiss Axiophot2 microsope (AxioVision software). Images of the whole CNS are
projections of a 1.5 μm-step z-series. Images of fat body and of high-magnification doublelabels of parts of the CNS are single sections except for the right panel of Fig. 3e, which is a
projection of 13 sections from a z-series.

Quantification of EdU incorporation
The “thoracic” region used for EdU quantifications corresponds to the ventral nerve cord
from brain-lobe level down to A1/A2, distinguishable from more posterior neuromeres by a
sharp transition in neuroblast density (Fig. 1a). The numbers of EdU+ voxels per CNS were
determined using Volocity (Improvision) from Leica SP5 confocal microscope scans (LAS
AF software) using a 1.5 μm-step z-series. An average of 10 CNSs were quantified per
experimental genotype and controls (siblings or half-siblings) were processed in parallel.
Control and experimental values were normalized using the average number of control
EdU+ voxels. For all histograms, error bars represent standard error of the mean (s.e.m) of
normalised values and asterisks indicate p<0.05 using two-tailed Student t-tests with equal
sample variance.
Larval mass measurements
Wet weights were determined for wandering L3 male larvae, sexed and genotyped in PBS,
dabbed dry with tissue and transferred to pre-weighed microfuge tubes. For each data point,
triplicate samples, each containing an average of 50 animals per genotype were weighed
(Precisa XB 120A balance).

Fig. 2. Insulin-like peptides but not mNSCs control neuroblast reactivation

a, EdU-labelled CNSs from various Ilp or InR mutants show decreased reactivation whereas
larvae with Ilp2-GAL4 driving UAS-p60 (mNSC>p60) do not. b, EdU incorporation
timecourse in the CNS of Df[Ilps1-5] larvae. c, The mass of fed L3 larvae at the wandering
(W) stage is significantly altered by Ilp2-GAL4 (mNSC>) driving PI3K signalling
components but not by repo-GAL4 (Glia>) driving Ilps.
