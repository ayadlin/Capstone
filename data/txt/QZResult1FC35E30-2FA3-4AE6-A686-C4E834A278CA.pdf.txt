concurrent with chemotherapy without prior surgical resection for stage III and
IV oropharyngeal carcinoma. Chemotherapy was platinum based. The gross tumor volume (GTV) received 70 Gy in 2.12 Gy per fraction. The high-risk clinical
tumor volume (CTV) received 59.4 Gy in 1.80 Gy per fraction, and the low-risk
CTV received 54 Gy in 1.64 Gy per fraction.

RESULTS. With a median follow-up of 33 months, the 3-year local, regional, and
locoregional progression-free probabilities were 94%, 94%, and 90%, respectively.
The 3-year overall survival estimate was 83%. Locoregional failures occurred in
the GTV in 7 patients. Acute grade 3 or 4 toxicity developed in 35 patients. A
feeding gastrostomy was placed in 25 patients. Late xerostomia was grade 0 in 16
patients, grade 1 in 31 patients, and grade 2 in 24 patients at last follow-up. No
patients experienced grade 3 or 4 late toxicity, except for 1 who developed osteoradionecrosis of the mandible.

CONCLUSIONS. Excellent local and regional control was achieved with IMRT and
concurrent chemotherapy without prior surgical resection in the treatment of
stage III and IV oropharyngeal carcinoma. Significant sparing of the parotid
glands and other critical normal tissues was possible using IMRT with moderate acute toxicities and minimal severe late effects. Cancer 2008;113:497–

istorically, the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer consisted of
surgery alone, radiation therapy alone, or a combination of
both.1-8 There are no dedicated randomized trials that have focused
on comparing radiotherapy versus surgery for oropharyngeal carcinoma. Radiotherapy is preferred at many centers because of presumed lower morbidity and better functional and cosmetic outcome
compared with surgical treatment, particularly with the increased
use of chemoradiation.9,10 Multiple randomized trials have shown
improvements in locoregional control and survival with the additions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy by using either conventional or altered fractionation in locally advanced head and neck
cancer, with locoregional control ranging from 36% to 70% in concurrent arms of each study.11-16 In addition, a meta-analysis per-

formed by Pignon et al of head and neck trials that
used chemotherapy showed an absolute survival
benefit of 4% in favor of chemotherapy, with most
benefit seen in the concomitant trials.17
With the advent of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the ability to generate highly conformal
dose distributions around the tumor volume while
sparing the nearby sensitive structures has greatly
improved.18 The question of whether this dosimetric
improvement creates better clinical outcomes remains
to be answered in prospective trials. The Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has conducted a
phase 1/2 study of early stage oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiation alone by using IMRT
techniques, but RTOG has not yet reported its results.
While results from multi-institutional trials are
awaited, clinical experience from a single institution
remains valuable. A recent report from Hong et al on
variations in target delineation for head and neck IMRT
made an important observation.19 For a T2N1 tonsillar
case with predefined gross tumor volume, there was
large variation in target delineation, dose prescription,
and treatment philosophies concerning whether to
treat the contralateral neck or to use neoadjuvant and/
or concurrent chemotherapy. Because of different institutional treatment philosophies, it is even more valuable to continue to report clinical experiences from
single centers, particularly for advanced-stage oropharyngeal cancer patients, who are not eligible for the
RTOG trial mentioned above.
At our institution, we have been using IMRT for
treatment of head and neck cancer since 1995.20-22
Oropharyngeal cancer patients have been treated with
IMRT since early 2000 after our initial successful experience in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients,
in terms of both improved locoregional control and
preservation of salivary function.20,21 The philosophy
of our institution in treating oropharyngeal carcinoma
has favored an organ-preservation approach by using
radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for
advanced-stage patients, with surgery planned for residual neck disease and surgical salvage if necessary.
This article reviews our experience in treating stage III
and IV oropharyngeal cancer patients by using definitive IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy without prior
surgical resection. In addition, we provide a detailed
dosimetric analysis, so that our experience in developing IMRT plans for these patients may be used for
comparison with experiences from other institutions.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Patient and Staging Evaluation
This study was approved by the committee on
human research at our institution. Between April

2000 and September 2004, 90 patients underwent
IMRT for newly diagnosed stage III or IV oropharyngeal carcinoma at our institution. Of these 90
patients, 11 patients underwent prior neck dissection, 1 patient had IMRT as a boost only, 1 patient
received only half of the treatment course because of
compliance issues, and 6 patients did not receive
concurrent chemotherapy. These cases were excluded
from the current analysis, leaving 71 evaluable
patients for this study.
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete history and physical examination, computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
head and neck region, and preradiation dental evaluation. Fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron
emission tomography (18FDG-PET) scans or PET/CT
scans were performed in 10 patients. All patients were
retrospectively restaged for the purpose of this analysis according to the 2002 American Joint Commission
on Cancer (AJCC) staging classifications.23

Simulation, Immobilization, and Treatment
Planning CT Procedures
The simulation and treatment planning processes for
patients with head and neck cancer have been
described previously.22 Briefly, head, neck, and
shoulder masks were used to immobilize the patient
with the neck supported on a Timo (S-type; MedTec
Group, South Plainfield, NJ).24 Treatment planning CT
scans with 3-mm slice thickness from the head down
through the clavicles were obtained. Because of significant weight loss or shrinkage of tumor, causing masks
to fit improperly, 12 of the 71 (17%) patients underwent fabrication of a new mask with a second CT scan
and a second IMRT plan generated for use during the
final portion of the course of treatment.25
Delineation of Target Volumes
The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the
gross extent of the tumor shown by imaging studies as
well as by physical examination, which included the
primary tumor as well as all involved regional lymph
nodes. MRI, 18FDG-PET, and contrast-enhanced CT
scans were used in the delineation of GTV in consultation with a neuroradiologist. When possible, the MRI
scans were merged with the CT scans in the treatment-planning system to ensure accurate delineation
of the target volumes. On the basis of the size of primary tumor and the number of involved lymph nodes,
the high-risk clinical tumor volume (CTV1) was
defined as the GTV plus margin for microscopic
spread, the retropharyngeal lymph nodal regions,
levels Ib, II, III, IV, and V lymph nodes, the parapharyngeal space, and the oropharynx. The margin for the

IMRT of Oropharyngeal Carcinoma/Huang et al.

GTV varied by anatomic boundaries and critical
adjacent tissues, and was up to 2 cm. The low-risk
clinical tumor volume (CTV2) generally included
contralateral, uninvolved, lymphatic-drainage areas,
particularly below the larynx. The planning target
volume (PTV) for each above-mentioned target volume was PTVGTV, PTVCTV1, or PTVCTV2, respectively,
which was typically 3-5 mm, depending on relative
locations of tumor volume and adjacent critical
tissues.

Radiation Dose Prescription and Chemotherapy
The prescription dose was 69.96 Gy/2.12 Gy/fraction
to 95% of the PTVGTV, concurrently with 59.4 Gy/
1.8 Gy/fraction to 95% of PTVCTV1, and 54 Gy/1.64
Gy/fraction to 95% of the PTVCTV2. All patients
were treated once a day, 5 days a week. Because of
rapid tumor progression, 2 patients initiated treatment with conventional radiotherapy that used laterally opposing beams to 9 and 12 Gy, respectively,
before the IMRT plan could be implemented.
All patients received concurrent chemotherapy
as follows: 61 patients were treated with cisplatin on
Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43 of radiation treatment,
and among these 61, 33 patients received 75-80 mg/
m2, and 28 patients received 100 mg/m2 cisplatin;
these 2 different dose schedules were selected at the
discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Ten
patients were treated with weekly carboplatin  paclitaxel because of their baseline poor renal
function or poor audiometry test results with concern for renal toxicity and ototoxicity from cisplatin.
A neck dissection was planned for patients who had
suspected residual neck disease 6-8 weeks after completing IMRT.
Treatment Technique, Planning, and Delivery
In our initial experience, the primary tumor and the
upper neck above the level of the vocal cords were
treated with IMRT. The lower neck and the supraclavicular fossae were treated with a single anterior field
by conventional radiotherapy. The IMRT field was
matched to the lower neck and supraclavicular field
with a split-beam technique. The dose uncertainties
at the match lines led us to switch to an EF-IMRT
(extended field-IMRT) plan, treating the primary tumor along with all the regional lymph nodes, including the supraclavicular nodes.26 Forty-five patients
were treated with EF-IMRT, and the other 26 were
treated with the split-beam technique.
Inverse plans were generated by using a commercial inverse planning system (Corvus versions 4
and 5; North American Scientific, NOMOS Division,
Chatsworth, Calif; NOMOS now part of Best Medical

499

International doing business as Best NOMOS, Sewickley, PA). Forward plans were generated by using
the Pinnacle planning system developed by Philips
Medical Systems (Royal Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, Netherlands). For inverse IMRT plans, a median
of 8 gantry angles (range, 5-14 angles) were used.
For the forward IMRT plan, 7 gantry angles with a
total of 13 segments were used.27 Treatment was
delivered by using a computer-controlled autosequence multileaf collimator system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Concord, Calif). Examples of a forward
IMRT plan and an inverse plan are shown in Figures
1 and 2 .

Dose-Volume Analysis of Treatment Plans
Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the PTVGTV,
PTVCTV1, and PTVCTV2, and the critical normal structures, such as the brainstem, spinal cord, middle and
inner ears, temporomandibular joints (TMJ), mandible, larynx, and parotids, were retrieved from our
planning system and analyzed accordingly. Because
of a limitation of the planning software, which did
not allow different contours to overlap, the parotid
glands that were contoured were usually the superficial parotid glands rather than the entire glands.
Sixty-seven patients were treated with inverse plans,
and 4 patients were treated with forward plans.
For PTVGTV, PTVCTV1, and PTVCTV2, the volume,
the mean dose, the dose to 1 mL of target volume
(D1mL), the dose to 99% and 95% of the target volume (D99 and D95, respectively), and percentage of
the volume that received 93% of the prescription
dose (V93%) were calculated. In addition, to evaluate
dose inhomogeneity inside the targets, the ratio of
the dose to 2% of the volume and D95 was calculated as well. For critical organs with functional subunits organized in series, the dose to 0.1 mL of target
volume and D1mL were examined. For critical organs
with functional subunits organized in parallel, the
mean doses were examined.
Statistical Methods
The 3-year local progression-free, regional progression-free, locoregional progression-free, disease
specific, and overall survival probabilities were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier product limit
method. Durations were calculated from the date of
diagnosis.

study. The primary sites of disease were palatine tonsil (25), base of tongue (43), and oropharyngeal wall
(3). Table 1 shows the T-stage and N-stage distributions of the patients according to the 2002 AJCC staging classification system. The disease was stage III
in 17 (24%) patients and stage IV in 54 (76%)
patients. There were 12 T1, 36 T2, 15 T3, and 8 T4
lesions; nodal status included 5 N0, 15 N1, 48 N2,
and 3 N3. Prior tobacco history included 18 patients
who never smoked, 33 patients who were former
smokers, and 20 patients who smoked within 1
month of diagnosis.

Treatment Outcome
With a minimum of 2 years of potential follow-up for
living patients, the median follow-up was 33 months
(range, 3-72 months). There were 11 deaths, and 7
occurred within 2 years of diagnosis. Fourteen other
patients were censored and had <2 years of followup, including 3 patients who required neck dissections within 2 years of diagnosis. The interquartile
range for follow-up for the 60 survivors was 25-43
months. The 3-year estimates of local, regional, and
locoregional progression-free survival rates were
94%, 94%, and 90%, respectively (Fig. 3). The 3-year

estimates of disease-free and overall survival rates
were 81% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 4).
More specifically, there were 4 isolated local
recurrences at the primary site at 6, 10, 15, and 43
months follow-up. Two patients developed neck only
recurrences at 15 and 30 months after diagnosis. One
additional patient developed extensive lung metastases with persistent locoregional disease confirmed by
18FDG-PET scan 3 months after completing chemoradiation. The characteristics of those patients who

developed locoregional failures are summarized in
Table 2. Analyses of pattern of failures were performed by using CT and 18FDG-PET scan or MRI
coregistration. All patients with locoregional failures
recurred in the GTV.
Fourteen patients had suspected persistent disease in the neck clinically or by imaging at 6-8 weeks
after their completion of radiotherapy and underwent neck dissection. However, only 2 of these 14
(14%) patients had pathological evidence of disease.

Both patients remained disease-free in the neck after
dissection. Four additional patients developed distant

Acute and Late Toxicity
Acute side effects of radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy were moderate. Acute grade 3 or
4 toxicity developed in 35 patients. A feeding gastrostomy was placed in 25 patients, including 2 patients
who had a feeding gastrostomy placed prophylactically before the start of chemoradiation because of
low baseline body weight. One patient had a nasogastric tube placed toward the end of treatment to
avoid a feeding gastrostomy. The most common
acute toxicities were mucositis (6 grade 1; 27 grade 2;
34 grade 3; 4 grade 4), dermatitis (35 grade 1; 32
grade 2; 4 grade 3; 0 grade 4) and neutropenia (49
grade 0; 6 grade 1; 8 grade 2; 7 grade 3; 1 grade 4).
The late normal tissue effects were scored
according to RTOG criteria.28 One patient developed
grade 4 osteoradionecrosis of the mandible 14
months after chemoradiation for T4N2c squamous
cell carcinoma of the tonsil, after a tooth extraction

without prophylactic hyperbaric oxygen therapy. He
was treated with hyperbaric oxygen, surgical debridement, and tongue flap to cover the mucosal defect.
DVH analysis showed that 25% of the volume of the
mandible received >65 Gy, with a maximum point
dose of 76 Gy, corresponding to the region of mucosal ulceration. There were no other grade 3 or 4 late
toxicities noted. Late xerostomia was grade 0 in 16
patients, grade 1 in 31 patients, and grade 2 in 24
patients at last follow-up. Among patients who had
<2 years of follow-up, because of death or otherwise
being lost to follow-up, 13 of 21 (62%) had grade 2
xerostomia at last follow-up. In contrast, among
patients who had at least 2 years of follow-up, only
11 of 50 (22%) reported grade 2 xerostomia, suggesting a recovery trend with longer follow-up.

Dose-Volume Analysis
The inverse IMRT plans from 67 patients were used
for this analysis. To obtain target volumes, the average volume and mean doses for the PTVGTV, PTVCTV1,
and PTVCTV2 were extracted from the plans (Table 3).
In addition, endpoint doses derived from DVHs for
PTVs including D1mL, D99, D95, and V93% are also
reported here.
With regard to normal tissue doses (Tables 4 and
5), there was significant sparing of all critical structures without compromising tumor target coverage.
In patients for whom 2 IMRT plans were used for
treatment, similar target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing were achieved. Because of the
complexity of adding doses from 2 different IMRT
plans based on 2 different CT scans, the plan with
lower doses to target volumes and higher doses to

case scenario. Of note, excellent target coverage
could be achieved with either a forward or inverse

method delivered lower doses to the surrounding
normal tissues than the forward plan method.19 The

treated with inverse plans, whereas the average mean
parotid dose was 37.1 Gy in patients treated with forward plans. Since 2003, we have treated all of our

DISCUSSION
Our current series reports on patients with stage III
and IV oropharyngeal carcinoma treated with definitive chemo-IMRT without prior surgical resection.
With a median follow-up of 33 months, the 3-year
locoregional control was 90%, and the 3-year overall
survival was 83%.
Our finding of excellent locoregional control with
IMRT is consistent with other reports from singleinstitution studies, as summarized in Table 6. Garden
et al reported their results for IMRT for small oropharyngeal carcinoma treated primarily without
chemotherapy. The 2-year locoregional control was
94%.29 de Arruda et al published their single-institution experience to date in treating stage I-IV oropharyngeal cancer for 50 patients with a median followup of 18 months.30 Most (86%) patients received concurrent chemotherapy. The 2-year estimates of local

and regional progression-free probabilities were 98%
and 88%, respectively. Chao et al reported their experience in treating oropharyngeal carcinoma
patients with IMRT.31 Forty-three of their 74 (58%)
patients were treated with surgery and postoperative
IMRT, whereas 31 patients were treated with definitive IMRT. The 4-year estimate of locoregional control was 87% for the entire group, 78% for the
definitive group, and 95% for the postoperative
group. The volumes of the GTV for both the primary
site and the lymph nodes were found to be independent predictors of locoregional control. Eisbruch
et al reported their experience in treating non-nasopharyngeal head and neck cancer with IMRT.32
Included in this series were 80 oropharyngeal
patients. Among them, 43 of 80 (54%) were treated
definitively, and the rest of them were treated postoperatively. Overall, the 3-year locoregional control
was 94% for all oropharyngeal cancer patients. The
present series is 1 of the largest reported for stage III
and IV oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with
IMRT and chemotherapy without prior surgery.
There are many reasons for the observed apparent improvement in locoregional control using IMRT
with concurrent chemotherapy. This group of
patients may have better prognosis due to favorable
factors such as early T stages (54% T1 and T2),
younger median age (55 years), and fewer smokers
(20 current smokers). The last 2 factors may indicate
a patient population associated with human papillomavirus infection. Optimized tumor target coverage
and dose delivery from IMRT may prevent marginal
recurrences seen with traditional 2-dimensional
opposed lateral fields.33 Further investigation of the
pattern of failure for our series has shown that predominantly failure is in the GTV, with no marginal
misses, indicating that our practice of target volume
delineation has been adequate.22,31,34 We continue to
recommend the use of optimal image modalities (eg,
MRI, PET-CT, or contrast-enhanced CT scans) to
assist the delineation of the tumor targets. In addition, we routinely consult a neuroradiologist to assist
in GTV delineation. Because of failures in the GTV,
dose escalation to the GTV and the hypoxic regions
may further improve the local control rate.
Acute toxicity in this study was moderate and
comparable to those of other chemoradiation trials
that used conventional radiotherapy techniques and
fractionation and concurrent chemotherapy.11-16 We
were able to administer concurrent chemotherapy
and IMRT in our patients without creating undue
toxicity or compromising the delivery of radiotherapy. Findings of severe acute toxicity have been
reported at some institutions where a higher dose

IMRT of Oropharyngeal Carcinoma/Huang et al.

per fraction at 2.40 Gy was used, rendering concurrent chemotherapy excessively toxic.35 In a doseescalation study, the maximal tolerated dose deliverable to the GTV by using IMRT as a sole treatment
for locally advanced head and neck cancer was
reached at 70.8 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.36 Gy.36 In our
study, chemo-IMRT that used 2.12 Gy per fraction to
70 Gy was well tolerated. Late effects from higher
doses per fraction versus concurrent chemotherapy
with a more moderate dose per fraction remain to be
seen when longer clinical follow-up becomes available.
Late toxicity from our regimen of chemotherapy
and IMRT has been very minimal, although longer
follow-up may be needed to document the full spectrum of late effects from IMRT. A feeding tube was
used in only 35% of patients. Additional studies of
swallowing function with prospective evaluation are
underway at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) to document the full spectrum of
changes in swallowing function in patients with head
and neck cancer who have undergone IMRT. Our
approach is to avoid a feeding tube during and after
treatment as well as prophylactic placement in this
group of patients, if possible. Rather, patients
undergo active swallowing therapy and counseling
during and after treatment. This regimen might well
have provided benefit in maintaining pharyngeal
function in the current series.
Historically, xerostomia has been a significant
late sequela that has affected advanced-stage oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with conventional
radiotherapy, a technique that typically includes
most of their parotid glands in the treatment field
treated to a high dose bilaterally. IMRT provides a
means to spare the parotid glands, thereby avoiding
the side effect of late xerostomia and improving
patients’ quality of life. Studies have shown that stimulated salivary function after parotid-sparing IMRT
can be preserved when the mean parotid dose is limited to 26 Gy.37 In the present series, the average
mean parotid dose was 25.5 Gy. At last follow-up,
only 24 of 71 (33%) patients in the current series
reported grade 2 xerostomia, with no patients reporting higher than grade 2 xerostomia. As previously
reported in our nasopharyngeal patient population,
recovery of salivary function is time dependent, with
a median time to recovery at 10.5 months with continued improvement up to 24 months.20 In the current study, patients who had at least 2 years of
follow-up reported lower incidence of grade 2 xerostomia compared with patients who had shorter
follow-up. One reason to explain the slightly higher
than expected rate of xerostomia is that the reported

505

parotid doses were extracted from treatment plans,
which may underestimate the true parotid doses
because of the characteristics of the planning system,
which does not allow overlap of tumor volumes and
other
surrounding
normal-tissue
structures.38
Furthermore, compared with patients who have nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a significantly higher volume of the oral cavity and tongue received high
doses of radiation because of the anatomical location
of the primary tumor. The submandibular glands,
sublingual glands, and other minor salivary glands
may be more affected by radiation in this cohort of
patients. Further decrease of coverage of the oral
cavity should be weighed very carefully against the
risk of tumor recurrence. With more experience in
treatment planning, we are able to consistently
achieve parotid doses lower than 26 Gy.
The surgical management of the neck after chemoradiation is controversial, with some physicians
supporting routine use of planned neck dissection in
patients with N2 or higher disease in the neck.
Patients who have a complete response in the neck
are followed at our institution. In our study, 14
patients underwent neck dissection shortly after they
completed IMRT for persistent nodal enlargement.
Only 2 of these 14 dissected patients were found to
have evidence of residual tumor in their neck-dissection specimens. Two other reports from our institution have also addressed this issue.39,40 Recent
reports suggest that 18FDG-PET scan may be useful
for selected patients who may benefit from a neck
dissection after radiation therapy. Yao et al showed
that for patients with residual lymphadenopathy and
a negative PET scan at 12 weeks after definitive
radiation treatment, neck dissection can be safely
withheld,41 with a negative predictive value of 100%
and a positive predictive value of 43%.
In conclusion, at our institution in the treatment
of stage III and IV oropharyngeal carcinoma without
prior surgical resection, IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy have resulted in excellent local and regional
control. It is hoped that further refinements of treatment will address the long-term impact of these
treatment schedules on speech and swallowing as
well as locoregional control and survival.
