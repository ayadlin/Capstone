Abstract
Topical application of the bioflavonoid 4¶,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) to mouse skin effectively reduces the
incidence and size of skin tumors caused by UVB exposure.
The ability to act as a chemopreventive compound indicates
that apigenin treatment alters the molecular events initiated
by UVB exposure; however, the effects of apigenin treatment
on UVB-irradiated keratinocytes are not fully understood.
In the present study, we have used three models of human
keratinocytes to study the effect of apigenin treatment on
UVB-induced apoptosis: HaCaT human keratinocyte cells,
primary keratinocyte cultures isolated from human neonatal
foreskin, and human organotypic keratinocyte cultures.
Each keratinocyte model was exposed to a moderate dose
of UVB (300–1,000 J/m 2 ), then treated with apigenin
(0–50 Mmol/L), and harvested to assess apoptosis by Western
blot analysis for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage,
annexin-V staining by flow cytometry, and/or the presence of
sunburn cells. Apigenin treatment enhanced UVB-induced
apoptosis >2-fold in each of the models tested. When
keratinocytes were exposed to UVB, apigenin treatment
stimulated changes in Bax localization and increased the
release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria compared
with UVB exposure alone. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl-2 and expression of a dominant-negative form of
Fas-associated death domain led to a reduction in the ability
of apigenin to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis. These results
suggest that enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by
apigenin treatment involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways. The ability of apigenin to enhance UVBinduced apoptosis may explain, in part, the photochemopreventive effects of apigenin. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):3057–65]

Introduction
Each year, over 1 million patients present with nonmelanoma
skin cancers in United States, making it the most common form of
cancer in this country (1). Extensive epidemiologic, clinical, and
biological studies have concluded that overexposure to solar UV
radiation is responsible for the development and progression of
>90% of skin cancers (2–5). UVB radiation acts as a tumor initiator
and promoter in the absence of any other agent by causing damage
to critical macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids (ref. 6

and references therein). The cellular damage caused by exposure
to low doses of UVB can usually be removed by repair; however,
exposure to high doses of UVB overwhelm repair machinery, and
apoptosis is initiated to remove damaged cells from the epidermis.
Failure to remove the damage either by repair or apoptosis results
in the retention of UVB-induced mutations that can lead to aberrant
regulation of cell signaling ultimately responsible for tumor
formation (7, 8). Education regarding the harmful effects of UVB
radiation has been emphasized in recent years; however, primary
prevention approaches have had limited success at reducing skin
cancer incidence (9). The above findings emphasize the need to
develop an agent that can prevent UVB-induced damage and/or the
biological effects of UVB exposure by eliminating damaged cells
with carcinogenic potential.
Currently there are two major strategies being used for the
prevention of UVB-induced skin cancer. The first approach involves
use of sun screens and other agents to prevent UVB-induced
damage, thus reducing the formation of ‘‘initiated’’ cells. A second
chemoprevention strategy aims to eliminate initiated cells with
carcinogenic potential. This strategy is attractive clinically because it
allows intervention during the longer period of time between
development of preneoplastic foci and appearance of the tumor.
4¶,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) is a nonmutagenic, naturally
occurring flavonoid found in a variety of fruits and leafy vegetables
(10). Topical application of apigenin to mouse skin reduced the size
and frequency of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens (11).
Furthermore, Birt and coworkers (12) reported that apigenin
applied topically to mouse skin inhibited UVB-induced skin
carcinogenesis. Our group and others have shown that apigenin
treatment of cells results in a wide variety of antitumorigenic and
chemopreventive actions (13–18). More recently, we have focused
our investigative efforts on determining the effects of apigenin
treatment on keratinocytes exposed to UVB radiation (19, 20), the
primary causative agent of skin cancers.
In the present study, we have used multiple methods to
investigate the effect of apigenin treatment on UVB-induced
apoptosis in three human keratinocyte models: HaCaT keratinocyte
cells, primary human keratinocyte cultures derived from neonatal
foreskin, and human organotypic keratinocyte cultures. We present
results demonstrating that apigenin treatment enhanced UVBinduced apoptosis >2-fold in each of the models tested. We also
show that enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin
treatment involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
pathways. The present work shows that the photochemopreventive
properties of apigenin may be explained, in part, by its ability to
enhance UVB-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes. This is
the first report demonstrating the effect of apigenin treatment on
UVB-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and plasmids. DMSO and apigenin were purchased from
Sigma Chemical Co. Hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) was purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from
Biomedical Technologies, Inc. pBABE vector was purchased from Addgene,
and plasmid 1764 was donated by Dr. Robert Weinberg (Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Human Bcl-2 overexpression
vector in pBABE was a generous gift from Dr. Vincent Cryns (Northwestern
University, Chicago, IL). The Fas-associated death domain (FADDdn)-LZRS
expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. Mitch Denning (Loyola
University, Maywood, IL).
Cell culture. HaCaT cells, a spontaneously immortalized human
keratinocyte cell line, were cultured as described previously (21).
HaCaT cells were 85% to 90% confluent at the time of exposure to UVB
or ‘‘sham’’ irradiation followed by treatment with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L
apigenin. HaCaT/pBABE-U6 and HaCaT/p53shRNA cells were generated
and cultured as described by Boswell et al. (22) and kindly provided by
Dr. Sam Lee (Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School,
Charlestown, MA).
The Phoenix-Ampho retroviral packaging cells used to transduce HaCaT
cells with retrovirus encoding FADDdn or overexpression of Bcl-2 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection with permission from
Dr. Gary P. Nolan (Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA).
The packaging cells were cultured as decribed by Sitailo et al (23). J2-3T3
fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated bovine
serum (Life Technologies) and gentamicin/amphotericin solution (Cascade
Biologics).
Isolation and culture of primary keratinocytes. Primary keratinocytes
were isolated from normal human neonatal foreskin obtained from the
Pathology Core Facility (Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Center of Northwestern University) as described previously by Sitailo et al (23). Primary
keratinocytes were then washed with M154CF keratinocyte medium
containing 0.07 Amol/L CaCl2, GA solution, and human keratinocyte
growth supplements (Cascade Biologics). Experiments on primary keratinocytes were conducted on cells at passage V4.
Preparation of collagen gels and human organotypic keratinocyte
cultures. Aliquots of 1  106 J2-3T3 fibroblasts were resuspended in
10 reconstitution buffer, 10DMEM (Sigma), and rat tail collagen I (BD
Biosciences). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. This mixture was then
dispensed into Falcon Cell Culture Inserts (pore size, 3.0 Am) placed in BD
Companion Plates (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37jC for 45 min. The
collagen/fibroblast gels were cultured for 24 h submerged in E medium as
described by Wu et al. (24). Primary keratinocyte cultures were trypsinized,
and 1  106 keratinocytes were resuspended in E medium containing 5 ng/
mL EGF and seeded on top of each collagen gel. Keratinocytes form a
monolayer sheet on top of the collagen/fibroblast matrix while cultured
submerged in E medium for 2 d containing 5 ng/mL EGF with daily medium
changes. Medium was then aspirated carefully, and the Falcon inserts were
placed into a BD BioCoat Deep-well Plate designed for use with 6-well size
BD Falcon Cell Culture Inserts and cultured at an ‘‘air/liquid interface’’ for 6 d
with daily medium changes. On day 6, the human organotypic keratinocyte
cultures were exposed to UVB or sham radiation and then incubated with 0,
25, or 50 Amol/L apigenin for 24 h; cultures were harvested on day 7.
Transduction of keratinocytes. Phoenix cells were transfected with
6 Ag of either Bcl-2–overexpressing vector, FADDdn-expressing vector, or
control vector (pBABE vector) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for
6 h as directed by manufacturer. Phoenix cells were then selected for 2 to
3 d in medium containing 1 Ag/mL puromycin. The virus was generated,
harvested, and used for infection as described previously (23).
UVB irradiation and apigenin treatment. Cells were exposed to UVB
and treated with apigenin as described previously by Tong et al. (19).
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and lysed in Triton Lysis
Buffer as described previously (19). Whole cell lysates were collected and
then sonicated thrice for 3 sec followed by centrifugation. Aliquots
containing equal amounts of protein from samples were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

blocked for 1 h using 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were probed with
primary antibodies for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP), phospho-Ser15p53 (Cell Signaling Technology), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) from Chemicon, and p53-FL-393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
overnight at 4jC in 5%. After incubation with appropriate horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies, signals were detected with an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).
Apoptotic assays. Cells were treated as indicated, harvested by
trypsinization, and labeled using Annexin-V-APC as recommended by the
manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Annexin-V–positive cells were measured
using a Dako Cytomation CyAn flow cytometer (Flow Cytometry Core
Facility). The average of replicate experiments was used to determine
statistical significance by paired t test using Prism 3.0 software.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Human organotypic keratinocyte cultures were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed for
histology, and embedded lengthwise in paraffin to ensure a cross-section
cut. Each 5-Am section was dewaxed and stained with H&E to evaluate
formation of sunburn cells. They stain with a small, condensed pyknotic
nucleus and highly eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm, and are a hallmark of
apoptosis in the epidermis as described by Brash et al (25). Quantitative
assessment of keratinocytes staining positive for sunburn cell formation
from each sample was analyzed by blind counting the number of positive
cells per millimeter of tissue. Statistical significance was determined by
paired t test.
Immunofluorescence. To observe cytochrome c and Bax, keratinocytes
were adhered to glass coverslips and then exposed to 0 or 750 J/m2 UVB,
and then incubated with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin for 16 h. Cells
were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and
then ice-cold 90% methanol for 5 min. Cells were blocked in 5% goat serum
(Life Technologies) in PBS containing 0.02% saponin (Sigma). Cells were
then incubated with primary antibody to cytochrome c (BD Biosciences)
and Bax (Upstate Cell Signaling) at 1:300 dilution in blocking buffer. The
appropriate Alexa Fluor–conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was
used at 1:300 dilution in blocking buffer followed by mounting the cells on
slides using Vectashield containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories). Cell staining was observed by fluorescence microscopy using
a ZEISS axiovert 200 man fluorescence microscope and photographed using
an AxioCam HR camera.

Results
UVB induces apoptosis in human keratinocytes. To test
whether apigenin treatment of keratinocytes enhanced UVBinduced apoptosis, we first carried out dose-response studies to
establish the UVB dose that would produce moderate (but not
complete) levels of apoptosis in each of the three model systems
tested. These studies were necessary to identify a UVB dose that
could then be combined with apigenin treatment to determine
whether apigenin enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in each
particular model. The dose of UVB required to induce intermediate
levels of apoptosis in HaCaT cells was shown by Western blot
analysis to be 300 J/m2 UVB. This dose produced modest levels of
apoptosis in HaCaT cells 8 hours postirradiation, as indicated by
cleavage of PARP, a repair enzyme known to be cleaved during
apoptosis (Fig. 1A).
Next, we exposed human primary keratinocyte cultures to
various doses of UVB to establish the dose required to induce a
moderate level of apoptosis in this system. Interestingly, testing of
primary keratinocyte cultures isolated from different donors
revealed varying levels of sensitivity to UVB radiation. In the
majority of experiments with primary human keratinocyte cultures,
we observed PARP cleavage at moderate levels 24 hours after
exposure to 750 J/m2 UVB (Fig. 1B).
Lastly, we exposed human organotypic keratinocyte cultures to
different doses of UVB (0–2,000 J/m2) to determine the dose

Apigenin Enhances UVB-Induced Apoptosis

Figure 1. UVB-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes. Cell lysates were
harvested and PARP cleavage was detected using a monoclonal PARP antibody
to assess apoptosis induced by UVB exposure. Membranes were stripped
and reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control. A, HaCaT cells were grown to
80% to 90% confluence and then exposed to 0, 300, 500, 750, or 1,000 J/m2
UVB. The cells were incubated for 8 h. B, primary human keratinocyte cultures
were grown to 60% confluence; exposed to 0, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250,
or 1,500 J/m2 UVB; and then incubated for 24 h. C, human organotypic
keratinocyte cultures were cultured at the air/liquid interface for 6 d, then
exposed to 0, 1,000, 1,500, or 2,000 J/m2 UVB and incubated for 24 h. The
epidermis was removed from the dermis with forceps and was lysed in urea
sample buffer.

required to induce moderate levels of apoptosis in this third
model system. Our results of Western blot analysis for PARP
cleavage (Fig. 1C) show that a slightly higher dose of UVB
(1,000 J/m2) was required to induce moderate levels of apoptosis in
human organotypic keratinocyte cultures compared with the dose
capable of inducing moderate levels of apoptosis in the monolayer
primary keratinocyte cultures (750 J/m2; Fig. 1B). The barrier
provided by the presence of multiple differentiated epidermal
layers in this experimental model may account for the slightly
higher dose of UVB necessary to induce moderate levels of
apoptosis. It is of note that sensitivity to UVB-induced apoptosis in
human organotypic keratinocyte cultures was correlated to the
sensitivity of keratinocytes when they were exposed to UVB in
monolayer culture (data not shown). The results presented in this
section provided us with a specific dose of UVB radiation capable
of inducing a moderate level of apoptosis in each experimental
model. The dose of UVB identified above for each model system
was used in subsequent experiments to determine the ability of
apigenin to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis.
UVB-induced apoptosis is enhanced by apigenin treatment
of monolayer keratinocyte cultures. The ability of apigenin
treatment to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis was first examined
in human HaCaT cells. We exposed HaCaT cells to 0 or 300 J/m2
UVB radiation followed by incubation with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L
apigenin for 8 hours. Whole cell lysates were collected and

www.aacrjournals.org

analyzed by Western blot analysis for extent of PARP cleavage.
UVB-irradiated keratinocytes showed a greater level of apoptosis
as measured by PARP cleavage when treated with 20 Amol/L
apigenin (Fig. 2A) compared with UVB exposure alone. Because
Western blot analysis for PARP cleavage is difficult to quantitate,
we used flow cytometry to determine the percentage of annexin-V–
positive staining cells per 10,000 events as a second method to
measure apoptosis. Figure 2B shows apoptosis as measured by
annexin-V staining increased 1.8- and 2.2-fold in UVB-irradiated
HaCaT cells treated with 10 and 20 Amol/L apigenin (P < 0.05),
respectively, compared with UVB exposure alone.
To rule out the possibility that this phenomenon is limited to
HaCaT cells, we next tested the ability of apigenin to enhance
UVB-induced apoptosis in multiple preparations of primary human
keratinocyte cultures. Primary keratinocyte cultures demonstrating
moderate levels of apoptosis when irradiated with 750 J/m2 UVB
were used to evaluate the ability of apigenin to enhance UVBinduced apoptosis. Primary human keratinocytes were exposed to
0 or 750 J/m2 UVB, then incubated with medium containing 0, 10,
or 20 Amol/L apigenin for 24 hours, and harvested for Western blot
analysis. Treatment of UVB-irradiated keratinocytes with either
10 or 20 Amol/L apigenin resulted in increased apoptosis as
measured by PARP cleavage (Fig. 2C), compared with UVB alone. To
generate quantitative values for the extent of enhancement of
UVB-induced apoptosis in primary keratinocytes treated with
apigenin, we also stained the cells with annexin-V and measured
the percentage of apoptotic events by flow cytometry. UVBirradiated cells incubated with 10 and 20 Amol/L apigenin resulted
in a respective 1.9- and 2.7-fold increase in apoptosis (P < 0.05),
compared with UVB exposure alone (Fig. 2D). The results presented
in this section show that apigenin treatment leads to enhancement
of the apoptotic response initiated by UVB exposure in primary
human keratinocyte monolayer cultures.
UVB-induced apoptosis is enhanced by apigenin treatment
in human organotypic keratinocyte cultures. Numerous studies
have been conducted on the effectiveness of chemopreventive
compounds in monolayer cell culture. Here, we cultured primary
human keratinocytes isolated from neonatal foreskin in an
organotypic setting to more accurately predict the effect of
apigenin treatment on human skin exposed to UVB. Human
organotypic keratinocyte cultures were exposed to 0 or 1,000 J/m2
UVB then incubated with 0, 25, or 50 Amol/L apigenin for 24 hours.
The epidermal layer was then separated from the dermal fibroblast
collagen matrix, and tissue lysates were analyzed by Western blot.
The data presented in Fig. 3A show that human organotypic
keratinocyte cultures irradiated with 1,000 J/m2 UVB followed by
treatment with 50 Amol/L apigenin exhibited an increased level of
cleaved PARP compared with UVB alone. Treatment of human
organotypic keratinocyte cultures with 25 Amol/L apigenin had a
negligible effect on UVB-induced apoptosis.
To further evaluate the extent of apoptosis in human organotypic keratinocyte cultures, samples were exposed to 0 or
1,000 J/m2 UVB followed by treatment with 0, 25, or 50 Amol/L
apigenin. The samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
sectioned, and stained using H&E to evaluate architecture of
the human organotypic keratinocyte cultures and the presence of
apoptotic sunburn cells, which are characterized by a pyknotic
nucleus and highly eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm. Representative
sections of human organotypic keratinocyte cultures exposed
to 0 or 1,000 J/m2 UVB in combination with 0, 25, or 50 Amol/L
apigenin are shown in Fig. 3B with sunburn cells indicated by

arrows. The number of apoptotic sunburn cells in human
organotypic keratinocyte cultures were counted and then averaged
as described in Materials and Methods to assess the level of
enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis in organotypic keratinocyte cultures (Fig. 3C). In agreement with the Western blot data
(Fig. 3A), quantitative analysis of sunburn cell formation in human
organotypic keratinocyte cultures showed that 25 Amol/L apigenin
treatment had a negligible effect on UVB-induced apoptosis
(1.1-fold change; P > 0.5), but when the human organotypic
keratinocyte cultures were treated with 50 Amol/L apigenin after
UVB exposure, apoptosis increased 2.4-fold (P < 0.01). These findings
are the first to show enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis
by apigenin treatment of organotypic keratinocyte cultures.
Apigenin treatment of UVB-irradiated primary keratinocytes enhanced localization of Bax to the mitochondria,
leading to subsequent cytochrome c release. We used indirect
immunofluorescence to investigate the effect of apigenin treatment on localization of Bax in primary keratinocytes exposed to
0 or 750 J/m2 UVB and treated with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin
for 16 hours. As seen in Fig. 4A, Bax is uniformly distributed in
keratinocytes exposed to sham irradiation followed by treatment
with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin. Bax staining was more distinct
and seemed more punctuate in keratinocytes exposed to UVB
compared with sham-irradiated keratinocytes. Furthermore, pri-

mary keratinocytes exposed to UVB then incubated with medium
containing 10 or 20 Amol/L apigenin showed a marked increase in
the appearance of punctate localized staining of Bax compared
with primary keratinocytes exposed to UVB then incubated with
medium containing DMSO (vehicle control).
To evaluate whether the alterations in Bax localization led to the
release of cytochrome c, we exposed primary human keratinocytes
to 0 or 750 J/m2 UVB radiation; then treated with 0, 10, or
20 Amol/L apigenin; and stained the cells with an anticytochrome c
antibody. In keratinocytes exposed to 750 J/m2 UVB followed by
incubation with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin, cytochrome c
staining seemed more diffuse in a dose-dependent manner,
indicating that cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria
(Fig. 4B). No change in cytochrome c staining was observed in the
sham-irradiated keratinocytes treated with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L
apigenin. The above findings suggest that apigenin treatment of
UVB-irradiated cells enhanced localization of Bax to the mitochondria, which stimulated cytochrome c release and initiation of
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 reduced
the ability of apigenin to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis. To
investigate further how apigenin enhances UVB-induced apoptosis,
keratinocytes were infected with retrovirus overexpressing the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly

with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin for 8 h. A representative Western blot measuring apoptosis by PARP cleavage is shown. An antibody to GAPDH was used as a
loading control. B, HaCaT cells were exposed to 300 J/m2 UVB or sham radiation followed by incubation with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin for 8 h. Cells (5  105) were
stained with annexin-V, and 10,000 events were counted by flow cytometry. An increase in the percentage of annexin-V–positive cells (annexin + cells ) indicates
increased apoptosis. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, compared with UVB exposure alone. C, primary human keratinocyte cultures were exposed
to 0 or 750 J/m2 UVB and then incubated for 24 h with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin. Apoptosis was evaluated by assessing PARP cleavage by Western blot analysis
using a monoclonal antibody to PARP. The membranes were stripped and reprobed for GAPDH as a loading control. D, primary human keratinocyte cultures were
exposed to 750 J/m2 UVB or sham radiation followed by incubation with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin for 24 h. Cells (5  105) were stained with annexin-V, and
10,000 events were counted by flow cytometry. Increased annexin-V–positive cells indicate increased apoptosis. Columns, mean (n = 3; using keratinocytes
isolated from three different donors); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05 compared with UVB exposure alone.

reduced the level of apoptosis in each treatment group compared
with cells transduced with control vector (Fig. 5A). When Bcl-2–
overexpressing keratinocytes were exposed to UVB radiation and
treated with medium containing 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L apigenin, we
observed a 42%, 52%, and 42% reduction in apoptosis, respectively,
compared with vector controls (compare lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8,
and 11 and 12 in Fig. 5A). Our results show that overexpression of
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 reduced the ability of apigenin to
enhance UVB-induced apoptosis.
Expression of a dominant-negative FADD protected cells
from enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin
treatment. Transduction of HaCaT keratinocytes with a retroviral
construct coding for FADDdn was used to elucidate the role of
receptor-mediated apoptosis in this experimental system. The
percentage of annexin-V–positive cells was lower in FADDdn
keratinocytes than in vector controls for all treatment groups
(Fig. 5B). In particular, when FADDdn keratinocytes were exposed
to UVB then incubated in medium containing 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L
apigenin, apoptosis was reduced by 35%, 42%, and 45% respectively,
compared with vector controls (compare lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8,
and 11 and 12 in Fig. 5B). FADDdn keratinocytes were also more

resistant to enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin
treatment (compare lanes 4 and 12) than the corresponding
treatment in cells transduced with vector control (compare lanes 3
and 11). Collectively, our results confirm that enhancement of
UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin treatment involves activation
of both the receptor-mediated, extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and
the intrinsic pathway.
Enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin treatment is independent of p53 status in HaCaT keratinocytes.
HaCaT cells possess a mutant low-functioning p53 with an
increased p53 protein half-life (ref. 22 and references therein).
Therefore, we investigated whether the enhancing effect of
apigenin treatment on UVB-induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells
was p53-dependent by using two stable clones of HaCaT cells in
which p53 expression was ablated (Fig. 6A) with shRNA-targeting
p53 or control shRNA (kindly provided by Dr. Sam Lee; ref. 22).
HaCaT/p53shRNA cells were exposed to UVB or sham radiation,
incubated in medium containing 0 or 20 Amol/L apigenin for
8 hours, and then harvested for Western blot analysis. Cell lysates
from UVB-irradiated, apigenin-treated, and UVB + apigenin–
treated HaCaT/pBABE-U6 cells exhibited elevated levels of

phospho-Ser15 p53 compared with untreated HaCaT/pBABE-U6
cells (Fig. 6A). In both HaCaT/p53shRNA clones (lanes 8 and 12)
and in HaCaT/pBABE-U6 cells (lane 4), we observed enhancement
of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin treatment as evidenced by
increased PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A).
To quantitate the effect of UVB, apigenin, and UVB + apigenin
treatment on apoptosis, we measured annexin-V+ cells by flow
cytometry (Fig. 6B). Apigenin treatment significantly enhanced
UVB-induced apoptosis in both clone 15 and clone 22 of HaCaT/
p53shRNA cells, as well as in HaCaT/pBABE-U6 cells (lane 8 versus
6, lane 12 versus 10, and lane 4 versus 2, respectively; Fig. 6B).
Although it is possible that p53 modulates the enhancement of
UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin treatment, our findings show
that the enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin
treatment occurs largely via a p53-independent pathway.

Discussion
More than 15 years ago, Wei and coworkers (11) showed that
topical application of apigenin effectively inhibited chemical
carcinogenesis in mouse skin. Subsequent studies by Birt and
coworkers (12) revealed that apigenin applied topically also
inhibited UVB-induced photocarcinogenesis in SKH-1 hairless
mice. Further studies by others have investigated which molecular
processes are affected by apigenin treatment, thus providing
additional evidence that apigenin is an effective chemopreventive
agent. For example, Kuo and coworkers (14) have shown the ability
of apigenin to inhibit transformation. Experiments by Way et al.
and Yin and coworkers (17, 18) showed that apigenin induced
growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

cell lines. Similiarly, Wang and coworkers (26) reported that
apigenin induced G2-M arrest in human colon cancer cell lines.
Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that apigenin
treatment increased wild-type p53 stability in keratinocytes (15).
We also showed that apigenin can induce reversible G2-M cell cycle
arrest (27), and that G2-M arrest was accompanied by inhibition of
the p34(cdc2) cyclin-dependent kinase protein level and activity in
a p21(waf1)-independent manner (28). Van Dross et al. (29) showed
apigenin treatment can activate extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways,
and downstream transcriptional activators in 308 keratinocytes
and human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116.
More recently, our group has focused on the effects of apigenin
treatment on keratinocytes exposed to UVB radiation (19, 20).
These reports have shown that apigenin treatment downmodulates both basal and UVB-induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
expression in keratinocytes. A number of other laboratories have
shown that selective COX-2 inhibition can reduce tumor formation
(30–34), presumably by increasing apoptosis (35, 36) in cells that
have carcinogenic potential. A recent study by Akunda and
colleagues (34) reported COX-2 deficiency significantly increased
UVB-induced epidermal apoptosis, in agreement with previous
findings by Tripp et al. (32).
Two principal apoptotic pathways have been characterized in
the literature: the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and
the stress-mediated intrinsic pathway as reviewed by Fulda et al.
(37). UVB radiation induces both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
of apoptosis. Sitailo and coworkers (23) showed the critical
involvement of the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptotic
pathway in response to UVB radiation in keratinocytes by showing

Apigenin Enhances UVB-Induced Apoptosis

that expression of dominant-negative caspase-9 led to almost
complete inhibition of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9
activation typically induced by UVB. In the present study,
incomplete protection from enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes overexpressing the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2 allows for the possibility that enhancement of UVB-induced
apoptosis by apigenin treatment involves potentiation of receptormediated apoptosis. A recent report by Horinaka et al. (38) has
shown that apigenin can sensitize cells to receptor-mediated cell
death in various tumor cell lines if used in combination with tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand. It is possible
that direct activation of death receptors, such as Fas and TNFR1,
caused by UVB radiation (39–41) could be involved in the
enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis observed in irradiated
keratinocytes treated with apigenin. We show herein that FADDdn
expression in keratinocytes significantly reduced apigenin’s enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis compared with keratinocytes transduced with control vector. The reduced ability of
apigenin to enhance UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes
expressing FADDdn suggests that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
plays a critical role in apigenin’s enhancement of UVB-induced
apoptosis.
A number of laboratories have shown that treatment of
keratinocytes with natural products such as sanguinarine (42),
silibinin (43), curcumin (44), and caffeine (45, 46) can also enhance
UVB-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes. Induction of apoptosis
in cells repeatedly exposed to UVB exposure is thought to be an
important protective mechanism aimed at removing irreversibly
damaged and potentially carcinogenic keratinocytes from the

epidermis. In accordance with the above studies, we show herein
that the natural bioflavonoid apigenin also is capable of enhancing
UVB-induced apoptosis. We have identified additional pathways
through which apigenin exerts its photochemopreventive effects in
human keratinocytes. We observed enhancement of UVB-induced
apoptosis by apigenin treatment in HaCaT cells, in primary human
keratinocyte cultures, and in human organotypic keratinocyte
cultures.
Our laboratory has previously shown that apigenin treatment
induced the stabilization and transactivational activity of the
tumor suppressor p53 (15). In addition, a number of other
laboratories have reported that the chemopreventive properties
of apigenin can occur through p53-independent pathways as well.
For example, Shukla and coworkers (16) showed that apigenin
treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis and a
dose-dependent decrease in protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin
D2, and cyclin E in DU145 prostate cancer cell lines that possess a
mutant form of p53. In addition, apigenin treatment increased
apoptosis and expression of WAF1/p21, KIP/p27, INK4a/p16, and
INK4c/p18 compared with vehicle-treated controls similarly in
both 22Rv1 and PC-3 (p53 null) tumor xenograft mice in a dosedependent manner, suggesting that apigenin can exert its chemopreventive properties independently of p53 status (47). These
findings collectively support the premise that although apigenin
treatment mediates many p53-dependent pathways, apigenin can
also induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a p53-independent
manner. In agreement with these findings, we have shown herein
that apigenin treatment enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in
human HaCaT keratinocytes that have had p53 ablated (Fig. 6).

Figure 5. Apigenin (apig )-enhanced UVB-induced
apoptosis involves both the intrinsic pathway and the
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. A, HaCaT human
keratinocytes overexpressing Bcl-2 or expressing
control vector (pBABE) were exposed to 0 or 300 J/m2
UVB followed by incubation with 0, 10, or 20 Amol/L

for 8 h was quantified by annexin-V
staining. Cells (5  105) were stained
with annexin-V, and 10,000 events were
counted by flow cytometry. An increase
in the percentage of annexin-V–positive
cells indicates increased apoptosis.

compared with UVB + DMSO–treated
pBABE-U6.

Our findings also show that although it is possible that p53
modulates enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin,
it seems to occur largely via a p53-independent pathway.
Furthermore, apigenin treatment enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in stable HaCaT/p53shRNA cells, demonstrating that enhancement of UVB-induced apoptosis by apigenin treatment is not a
p53-dependent phenomenon.
Taken together, our results show that apigenin enhances UVBinduced apoptosis in human keratinocytes through both the
extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways. This conclusion is
based on the following observations: (a) Apigenin treatment
enhanced UVB-induced apoptosis in each model of human
keratinocytes as evaluated by Western blot analysis, annexin-V
staining by flow cytometry, and/or quantification of sunburn cells;
(b) Apigenin treatment of human keratinocytes facilitates changes
in Bax localization and cytochrome c release when exposed to UVB
