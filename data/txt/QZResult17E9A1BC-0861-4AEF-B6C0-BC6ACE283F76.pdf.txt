Abstract

Author Manuscript

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among women in the
United States, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood 1-3. Some epithelial cancers are known to
occur in transitional zones between two types of epithelium, while others have been shown to
originate in epithelial tissue stem cells 4-6. The stem cell niche of the ovarian surface epithelium
(OSE), which is ruptured and regenerates during ovulation, has not yet been unequivocally
defined. Here we identify the hilum region of the mouse ovary, the transitional/junction area
between OSE, mesothelium and tubal (oviductal) epithelium as a previously unrecognized stem
cell niche of the OSE. We find that cells of the hilum OSE are slowly-cycling and express stem/
progenitor cell markers ALDH1, Lgr5, Lef1, CD133, and CK6b. These cells display long-term
stem cell properties ex vivo and in vivo, as shown by our serial sphere generation and by longterm lineage tracing assays. Importantly, the hilum cells exhibit increased transformation potential
after inactivation of tumour suppressor genes Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are frequently
altered in the most aggressive and common type of human EOC, high-grade serous
adenocarcinoma 7,8. Our study experimentally supports the notion that susceptibility of
transitional zones to malignant transformation may be explained by the presence of stem cell
niches in those areas. Identification of a stem cell niche for the OSE may have important
implications for understanding EOC pathogenesis.

An extensive integrated genomic analysis of 489 high-grade serous ovarian
adenocarcinomas has provided important insights about repertoire of molecular aberrations
characteristic for this most common and deadly form of EOC 7. However, interpretation of
such results is complicated by continuous controversy about the cell of origin of this disease.
The OSE, the fimbrial epithelium of the uterine (Fallopian) tubes, and other derivatives of
the secondary Mullerian system have been proposed as likely sources of EOC based on
pathological observations, genetic and immunohistochemical studies of precursor lesions in
human cancer and experimental approaches in several species 2,3,9,10. Recently, it has been
hypothesized that transitional/junction regions between the OSE, mesothelium, and tubal
epithelium may have more plastic and, presumably, less differentiated state, thereby being a
possible place of origin of EOC 5,11,12. However, to date there are no direct experimental
data to support this notion.

Stem cells, such as those of blood and hair, are slow-cycling and retain DNA label in pulsechase experiments. Few years ago, OSE cells with some stem/progenitor cell properties have
been identified based on their slow proliferation in label retention assays 13. Unfortunately,
it remains uncertain if these cells have potential for long-term self-renewal, a key feature of
stem cells. It is also unknown if these cells occupy anatomically defined areas, similar to
those in other organs, such as the intestine, hair follicle, cornea and prostate 14,15. Activity
of detoxifying enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and corresponding expression of
ALDH1 have been identified as a useful marker of stem/progenitor cells in a number of cell
lineages, such as mammary, prostate, colon, hematopoietic, neural, and mesenchymal 16-19.
It has been also reported that about 7.6 % of OSE cells have high ALDH activity 20. Thus
we tested if detection of this activity can be used for enrichment of normal OSE stem/
progenitor cells. We separated primary OSE cells into ALDH high (ALDH+) and ALDH
low (ALDH-) populations according to their level of ALDEFLUOR fluorescence by
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS, Supplementary Fig. 1), and subjected them to
newly established monoclonal OSE-sphere formation assays (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary
Fig. 2, 3). ALDH+ cells represented 5.3% of OSE population and formed larger OSE
spheres and at significantly higher frequency as compared to ALDH-cells (Supplementary
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with expected self-renewal properties of
stem/progenitor cells, spheres were formed from a single cell suspension in at least 5
consecutive rounds of sphere dissociation and regeneration (Fig. 1c).

Towards identification of ALDH1+ OSE cells in the mouse ovary we have performed
immunohistochemical staining for ALDH1 expression in ovarian tissues from 3, 6 and 8
weeks old virgin FVB/N, C57BL/6J, B6;129 and Swiss Webster mice. Since the ovary has
well defined anatomical regions, we have evaluated expression of ALDH1 in the OSE
covering the corpus luteum, the distal, antral and the hilum regions, as well as in the tubal
epithelium. Strikingly, in mice of all age and strain groups, cells with high ALDH1 activity
have been predominantly detected in the hilum region (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 5).

This region represents the point where nerves and vessels enter the ovary and is covered by
the epithelium representing the transition between OSE, mesothelium and tubal epithelium.

Author Manuscript

To determine the location of slow proliferating cells we performed pulse-chase experiments
by injecting 6 - 7 weeks old virgin FVB/N mice for 10 days with a BrdU solution followed
by detection of label retaining cells (LRCs) immediately and monthly for up to 3 months
after the pulse (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Ovarian regional analysis revealed that the hilum
contains the highest percent of slow-cycling OSE cells by 3 months after BrdU pulse (Fig.
1e and Supplementary Fig. 6b). These LRCs expressed ALDH1, as shown by double
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1f). In agreement with earlier reports 13,21, proliferation of OSE
was significantly greater after ovulation. To test if LRCs preferentially divide after
ovulation, cells double positive for BrdU and Ki67 were scored in the hilum areas of mice
subjected to 2 and 3 months BrdU pulse chase experiments and sacrificed either in proestrus
(prior to ovulation) or estrus (after ovulation). Double positive cells were present in the
hilum OSE of mice only in estrus, no such cell were found in proestrus (Supplementary Fig.
7), suggesting that these LRCs were activated to repair the ruptured OSE.
We assessed the growth potential of OSE cells isolated by micro-dissection from the hilum
(posterior) and opposite part (anterior) regions of the ovary (Supplementary Fig. 8). After
three days of primary culture hilum OSE cells formed significantly more large colonies
(over ≥ 20 cells) than OSE from the anterior region (Fig. 2a, b). Notably, hilum cells
developed spheres at significantly higher frequency as compared to other OSE cells, which
could be propagated for at least 7 generations (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 9 and
Supplementary Table 2). These findings are consistent with results of our previous
experiments with ALDH+ cells.

Author Manuscript

For additional phenotypical characterization ALDH+ and ALDH- OSE cells were isolated by
FACS and their RNA used for gene expression profiling (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 10
and Supplementary Table 3). Aldh1 gene was among the highest expressed genes in ALDH+
cells (Supplementary Fig. 10). Among known stem cell markers Lgr5, CD133, CK6b, and
Lef1 were consistently higher in ALDH+ cells (Fig. 2e). Expression of these markers in the
hilum cells was also confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 2f). Consistently, we have found
that some of microRNAs counteracting stem cell properties, such as microRNAs of miR-34
family 22-24 as well as miR-376b (our unpublished data), are preferentially downregulated in
ALDH+ OSE cells relative to the ALDH- OSE population (Fig. 2g).

Author Manuscript

Since hilum cells express Lgr5, for tracing the fate of these cells we have taken an advantage
of Lgr5tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle/J (Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2) mice, which harbor a Lgr5-EGFPIRES-CreERT2 “knock-in” allele 25. In these mice, EGFP and Cre-ERT2 are expressed in
Lgr5 positive cells. However, activity of Cre-ERT2 fusion protein occurs only after
induction by tamoxifen. We have crossed Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice with
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J (Ai9) mice (Supplementary Fig. 11). In Ai9 mice
expression of Rosa26/CAG promoter-driven red fluorescent protein variant (tdTomato) is
possible only after Cre-mediated deletion of the STOP codon flanked by loxP sites 26. To
test if Lgr5 promoter directs Cre expression to the hilum cells, mice were exposed to a single
dose of tamoxifen and their ovaries have been collected 1 and 3 days later. Microscopy

analysis showed that cells of the hilum have been exclusively labeled in the OSE at these
early time points (Fig. 3a-c and Supplementary Fig. 12a-g). Control experiments included
administration of oil to double knock-in littermates (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 12hj). Also wild-type mice and mice carrying only one of the knock-in alleles have been
analyzed with and without tamoxifen administration. To test if Lgr5-expressing hilum cells
contribute to the rest of the OSE, we collected ovaries of Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 Ai9
mice at 1 and 2 months after tamoxifen administration. The majority of OSE cells in
tamoxifen but not control experiments expressed tdTomato, indicating that the hilum cells
contribute to regeneration of the OSE covering the ovary (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.
12k, l).

TP53 mutations and alterations of RB1 pathway occur in 96% and 67%, respectively, of
human high-grade serous adenocarcinomas 7,8, and result in formation of similar
malignancies in genetically modified mice 27,28. Thus we have compared proliferation and
immortalization efficiency of the OSE cells located at the hilum and in the remainder of the
ovary after conditional inactivation of Trp53 and Rb1 (Supplementary Fig. 13). The hilum
cells have exhibited significantly increased proliferation and were passaged for over 20
times without crisis phase. At the same time the majority of the remainder OSE cell pool
have become senescent by passage 6 according to their enlarged flattened shape and
expression of senescence markers, such as of senescence-associated β galactosidase, p16 and
p27 (Fig. 4a-c and Supplementary Fig. 14).

Author Manuscript

We have also carefully evaluated various regions of the ovary for the early stages of
carcinogenesis induced by Cre-LoxP mediated recombination after a single administration of
AdCre into the ovarian bursa. Such administration results in infection of over 80% of cells
in all anatomical regions of the ovary followed by formation of Trp53 and Rb1-deficient
neoplastic lesions in a relatively synchronous manner (Supplementary Fig. 15, 16 and 27)
The earliest atypical cells were detected in the hilum and adjacent areas but not in the other
regions of the ovary or in the tubal epithelium in 12 of 16 mice (75%) by 60 days after
induction (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Table 4).

Author Manuscript

To directly test tumourigenic properties of Trp53 and Rb1-deficient primary OSE cells we
transplanted them intraperitoneally (i.p.) and subcutaneously (s.c.). In i.p. experiments,
seven out of eight mice (87%) transplanted with the hilum cells developed high-grade serous
adenocarcinomas characterized by extensive proliferation and expression of cytokeratin 8
(CK8), Wilms Tumour 1 (WT1), PAX8, Estrogen Receptor α (ER), Ephrin B1 and ALDH1
(Fig. 4d-n and Supplementary Fig. 18, 19). Notably, 5 of 7 neoplasms (71%) metastasized to
the lung (Fig 4l-n and Supplementary Fig. 18d-f). Only one out of 12 mice (8%)
transplanted with the remainder OSE cells developed carcinoma. This neoplasm expressed
CK8, WT1, ER, but contained less of ALDH1 highly-positive cells, only few PAX8 positive
cells, and was not metastatic (Supplementary Fig. 19, 20). Similar results were also observed
in s.c. experiments (Supplementary Fig. 19-21 and Supplementary Table 5). Thus, the hilum
cells have increased transformation potential after inactivation of Trp53 and Rb1 and may be
the cell of origin of EOC.

In summary, we show that the OSE at junction areas contains a novel stem cell niche, which
is responsible for OSE regeneration and is prone to malignant transformation. These
findings provide experimental rationale for targeted detection and characterization of
preneoplastic and early neoplastic lesions in the areas of transition between OSE,
mesothelium and tubal epithelium in humans. Presence of adult stem cells in the areas of a
junction between two types of epithelia has been definitively demonstrated only for the
limbus region, a narrow transitional zone between the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva 29 and
gastroesophageal junction 30. However, it remains insufficiently elucidated if such junctionassociated stem cell niches are predisposed to cancer. Our findings support this possibility
and suggest that similar junction areas in other organs, such as the uterine cervix and the
anus, may also contain cancer-prone stem cell niches, thereby explaining susceptibility of
such regions to malignant transformation. Given the well anatomically defined location of
the hilum in the mouse ovary, this region may represent an attractive model for further
studies aimed to understand why stem cell niches reside in the junction areas and how
aberrations in the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing epithelium regeneration
may contribute to ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis.

isolated cells was confirmed by RT-PCR detection of CK8 expression.
ALDEFLUOR assay and FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting)

Author Manuscript

For detection of ALDH enzymatic activity primary OSE cells (4 × 106) were placed in
ALDEFLUOR buffer and processed for staining with the ALDEFLUOR Kit (Aldagen,
Durham, NC) according to the manufacture's protocol. Cell sorting and data analysis were
performed on a FACS Aria II sorter equipped with the FACS DiVa software (BD
Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Unstained and ALDH inhibitor (4
(diethylamino)benzaldehyde 33, DEAB, at a 10-fold molar excess)-treated cells served as
controls. Dead cells were excluded with propodium iodide (PI). The 5 – 8% brightest
ALDH+ cells were identified and electronically gated based on their characteristic lightscatter properties on the FITC channel emission pattern after excitation with 13 mW - 20
mW, 488 nm laser, elliptical shape of BD FACSAria II. The ALDH fluorescence emissions
were then captured simultaneously through a 515/20 band-pass and 505 nm long-pass filter.
ALDH+ and ALDH- OSE cells were collected in 0.5 ml OSE-SCM and subjected to OSESphere-rim-assays or RNA isolation as described below.
OSE-sphere formation rim-assay

Author Manuscript

Cell populations (5 × 105 cells/assay) were collected in 0.5 ml OSE-SCM, centrifuged and
pellets were suspended in 1:1 reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix (Geltrex,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)/OSE-SCM in a total volume of 120 μl. Following a modified
protocol of Lawson et al 34 cells were placed around the rim of a well of a 12-well plate and
allowed to solidify for 25 minutes at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator before adding 1.5 ml
OSE-SCM. Spheres were grown for 7 to 12 days. For passaging of spheres, media was
aspirated and Geltrex was digested by incubation in 750 μl D-Buffer for 1 hr, at 37°C.
During incubation spheres were suspended 2 - 3 times manually by pipetting using a blue 1
ml tip. Digested cultures were pelleted and incubated in 0.3 ml 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA for 10
min at 37°C, cells were suspended and the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml
OSE-SCM. Cells were harvested and counted by hemocytometer and cultured at different

LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope coupled with an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Optical sections, 512 × 512 pixels, were collected
sequentially for each fluorochrome. The data sets acquired were merged and displayed with
the ZEN software (Zeiss).
Monoclonality assays

Author Manuscript

Two approaches were used. First, similarly to earlier studies in other cell types 34-36, single
cell suspensions of primary OSE cells from Tgβ-actin EGFP or β-actin DsRed mice were
mixed at various ratios, grown in OSE-sphere forming rim-assays for 7-12 days without subculture in SCCM, followed by counting the number of monochromatic and dichromatic
spheres. Second, development of spheres from individual cells in rim-assays was monitored
by imaging the same fields of view at different time points. All images were collected using
a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope coupled with an Epi-Fluorescence Attachment (Nikon,
Melville, NY) and equipped with a DS-L2 camera control unit and cooled camera head
DS-5Mc (Nikon).
Primary culture of the hilum and ovary parts
Individual hilum and anterior ovary parts were isolated under dissection microscope from
adult virgin FVB/N mice, minced in a drop of PBS with 25G needles and transferred to 100
μl D-Buffer, following by incubation as described for the isolation of primary OSE cells.
After 24 hrs adherent cultures hilum and anterior ovary part cells were collected and seeded
out for the cell proliferation or OSE-sphere-rim-assays.

Gene expression arrays
Total RNA was isolated using a mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
Ovation Pico WTA System V2 (NuGen, San Carlos, CA) was used to amplify cDNA, and
then labeled with biotin using Encore Biotin Module (NuGen). Labeled DNA was
hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
All microarray analyses were performed as previously described 31,32,37,38. Briefly,
microarray data were analyzed with GeneSifter software (Geospiza, Seattle, WA). To
identify genes significantly altered in ALDH positive population, we performed paired two

Senescence detection assays
For detection of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), OSE cells were fixed
with 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes, rinsed several times with PBS,
and incubated in SA-β-gal staining solution (4.2 mM citric acid, 12.5 mM sodiumphosphate, 158 mM sodium chloride, 0.21 mM magnesium chloride, 2.21 mg/ml potassium

For microdissection of frozen sections, 5 μm thick frozen sections of the mouse ovaries were
placed on slides for membrane-based laser microdissection (Leica Microsystems,
Bannockburn, IL) and evaluated under the Leica DM LA microscope coupled with a
Fluorescence illuminator LRF 4/22. EGFP expressing OSE from the hilum and different
ovarian regions were microdissected using the Leica AS LMD laser microdissection system

images were acquired before and after the microdissection. Manual microdissection of
hematoxylin and eosin stained sections was performed essentially as described
preciously 27,39,41. Tissues were collected into caps of 0.6 ml centrifuge tubes filled with
lysis buffer and used for subsequent PCR amplification prepared as described
previously 27,37,42-44.

Trp53 Rb1 deficient primary OSE cells derived from primary hilum or rest of the ovary were
suspended in 500 μl of PBS and injected intraperitoneally (8 × 106 cells) or subcutaneously
(5 × 104 - 5 × 106 cells) into 5 weeks old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ4 female mice.
Upon signs of sickness, such as abdominal distention, intra-abdominal masses or
subcutaneous masses over 1 cm in diameter, or moribund behavior mice were euthanized
and subjected to necropsy.
Morphological evaluation

Author Manuscript

Due to coiled structure of the mouse uterine tubes 45 4 μm thick paraffin serial sections
within 100 μm of the OSE/tubal epithelium junction were used for all studies of the hilum
region. Serial sections were also evaluated to exclude potential misinterpretation of
tangential sections in all relevant quantitative assays. All mice in carcinogenesis
experiments were subjected to gross pathology evaluation during necropsy. A particular
attention was paid to potential sites of ovarian carcinoma spreading, such as the omentum,
regional lymph nodes, the liver, the lung and the mesentery. In addition to the ovary,
pathologically altered organs, as well as representative specimens of the brain, lung, liver,
kidney, spleen, pancreas, and intestine, omentum and intra-abdominal lymph nodes, were
fixed in 4% PBS buffered paraformaldehyde, and evaluated by microscopic analysis of
paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and subjected to necessary
immunostainings. All early atypical lesions were diagnosed based on their morphology,
staining for Ki67 and detection of floxed out Trp53 and Rb1 as described earlier 27. Location
of all lesions was determined by 3D reconstruction of 4 μm thick serial sections as described
previously 39.

Immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis

Author Manuscript

Information about all primary antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table 6.
Immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue was
performed by a modified ABC technique 37-39. For immunofluorescence analysis,
deparaffinized or frozen sections and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Ten-minutes
treatment with 4N HCl and 10 minutes boiling in 10 mM citric buffer was used for antigen
retrieval for detection of BrdU. Staining of theca cells 46 served as a positive internal control
for ALDH1 detection. Sections with immunoperoxidase stainings were scanned by
ScanScope (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) with 40X objective followed by lossless
compression. Sections with immunofluorescent stainings were analyzed under an Axioskop
2 (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Quantitative analysis of
IHC and IF experiments were performed with the ImageJ software (W. Rasband, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) as described previously 37-39.
