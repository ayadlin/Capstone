Sonic Hedgehog Signaling in Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome
Mohammad Athar1, Changzhao Li1, Arianna L. Kim2, Vladimir S. Spiegelman3, and David R. Bickers2

Abstract
The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is considered to be a major signal transduction pathway during
embryonic development, but it usually shuts down after birth. Aberrant Sonic hedgehog (Shh) activation during
adulthood leads to neoplastic growth. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is driven by this pathway. Here, we
summarize information related to the pathogenesis of this neoplasm, discuss pathways that crosstalk with Shh
signaling, and the importance of the primary cilium in this neoplastic process. The identiﬁcation of the basic/
translational components of Shh signaling has led to the discovery of potential mechanism-driven druggable
targets and subsequent clinical trials have conﬁrmed their remarkable efﬁcacy in treating BCCs, particularly in
patients with nevoid BCC syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder in which patients inherit a
germline mutation in the tumor-suppressor gene Patched (Ptch). Patients with NBCCS develop dozens to
hundreds of BCCs due to derepression of the downstream G-protein–coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO).
Ptch mutations permit transposition of SMO to the primary cilium followed by enhanced expression of
transcription factors Glis that drive cell proliferation and tumor growth. Clinical trials with the SMO inhibitor,
vismodegib, showed remarkable efﬁcacy in patients with NBCCS, which ﬁnally led to its FDA approval in 2012.

Introduction
Skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma and
melanoma) are the most common types of human malignancy
with approximately 2.8 million new cases diagnosed annually
in the United States (1–3). Activated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
driven by mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene Patched
(Ptch) and/or the G-protein–coupled receptor Smoothened
(SMO) is known to promote oncogenic signaling and drives
the growth of basal cell carcinomas (BCC; ref. 4). Nevoid BCC
syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is an
autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals
develop multiple (dozens to thousands) of microscopic and
macroscopic BCCs, various benign hair follicle hamartomas,
palmar, and plantar pits in addition to skeletal defects (biﬁd
ribs and syndactyly), central nervous system abnormalities
(calciﬁcation of the falx cerebri and agenesis of the corpus
callosum), craniofacial features (enlarged skull, hypertelorism,
and frontal bossing), and benign odontogenic keratocysts of
the jaw (4, 5). In addition to BCCs, these patients are at
increased risk for other tumors, including medulloblastomas,
rhabdomyosarcomas, benign ovarian cysts, cardiac ﬁbromas,

and mesenteric cysts linked to aberrant/abnormally increased
Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling (4).
Disease penetrance in NBCCS is known to be dependent on
genetic background. Caucasians with sun-sensitive skin develop far more BCCs as compared with darker skinned individuals
(6, 7). For example, the frequency of BCCs development is
much higher in patients from the United States, Australia, and
the United Kingdom compared with Asians and African-Americans. Similarly, mean age of BCCs onset in Caucasians is much
lower than in patients from other Asian or African countries.
However, no marked differences were reported in the frequencies of other clinical manifestations in these different populations (6, 7).
Family based linkage analysis identiﬁed underlying mutations in the Patched 1 gene (Ptch1) located on chromosome 9 in
these tumors (8). PTCH 1 is a highly conserved 12-pass
transmembrane protein receptor that negatively regulates
(tumor suppressor) the Hh signaling pathway. The Hh ligands
namely Shh, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert hedgehog (Dhh)
bind to PTCH 1, thereby releasing the 7-pass transmembrane
protein SMO allowing its migration to the tip of the primary
cilium in which a multistep process activates Gli transcription
factors driving cell proliferation and tumor growth as summarized in Fig. 1. In vertebrates, three isoforms of Glis have
been identiﬁed. Gli1 and Gli2 are transcription activators
whereas Gli3 is generally a transcription repressor (4). Among
the three Hh ligands, Shh has been the most widely studied. Shh
overexpression in the skin induces epidermal hyperplasia by
antagonizing p21-mediated cell-cycle arrest. It also regulates
the growth and maturation of the dermal papillae of the hair
follicle. It signals via Glis to activate the Brahma/SWI2–related
gene 1 (Brg1) in bulge stem cells, which is important for hair

regeneration. Subsequently, Brg1 recruits NFkB required to
sustain proliferation in hair matrix cells (9). Dhh overexpression like Shh may lead to marked expansion of epidermal
progenitor cells, an increase in basal cell proliferative activity
and a delay in basal cell differentiation (10). Ihh is highly
expressed in human sebaceous skin tumors and human sebocyte cell lines. Recently, Kakanj and colleagues (9) showed the
importance of Ihh in murine skin cancer pathogenesis by
controlling proliferation and differentiation. It was also shown
to block metastasis (9). Ihh has also been linked to the
pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare but potentially
fatal epithelial skin neoplasm (11).
Upregulation of Hh signaling is considered the pivotal
abnormality in all BCCs (whether in patients with NBCCS or
in sporadic BCCs). Greater than 80% of sporadic BCCs have a
loss-of-function mutation in at least one allele of PTCH1 and
the remainders have activating gain-of-function mutations in
SMO. These mutations result in aberrant Hh signaling pathway
activation. Although aberrant Shh signaling is primarily
responsible for the pathogenesis of BCCs, it is also involved
in the growth of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Both BCCs

4968

and SCCs apparently share a common cell of origin, within the
interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle bulge, and hair germ
because all can give rise to both tumor types, depending on
the genetic milieu (for review see refs. 4, 12, 13).

Origin of BCCs
The cellular origin of BCCs has been a source of controversy
for over a century. In 1903, BCCs were proposed to originate
from the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis. Other
concepts focused on hair follicles or interfollicular epidermis
and so-called "follicular germinative cells." Others proposed
the involvement of cells from lower portion of the spinous cell
layer (14, 15). In 1990, Cotsarelis and colleagues (16) traced a
population of presumptive stem cells possessing a quiescent
phenotype to the hair follicle bulge both in mouse and humans.
On the basis of their long-lived nature, it was proposed that
these cells accumulate multiple genetic mutations driving
tumor formation (16). Youssef and colleagues (17) generated
mice conditionally expressing constitutively active mutant
SMO (SmoM2) and showed enhanced Hh signaling in various

epidermal cellular compartments capable of driving the
growth of BCCs. However, SmoM2 activation in bulge stem
cells and their transient amplifying progenies did not induce
BCCs. Using clonal analysis, these authors showed that BCCs
arise from long-term resident progenitor cells of the interfollicular epidermis and the upper infundibulum of the hair
follicle, thereby conﬁrming the idea that expression of differentiation markers in tumor cells may not predict the origin of
the cancer-initiating cells (17). Subsequently, using cell fate
tracking of X-ray–induced BCCs in Ptch1þ/ mice, Wang and
colleagues (18) showed that these tumors were almost exclusively derived from the keratin 15–expressing stem cells of the
bulge. Importantly, conditional p53 loss enhanced BCC growth
from both bulge precursors and the interfollicular epidermis, at
least in part by enhancing SMO expression (18).
Another remarkable study in this regard was the demonstration that phenotype of Hh-driven skin tumors is regulated
by not only the cell of origin but also the tissue context and level
of oncogenic signaling. Thus, nodular BCC-like tumors originate from a subset of stem cells localized in the lower bulge and
secondary hair germ compartment whereas high-level signaling in the interfollicular epidermis is essential for the growth of
superﬁcial BCCs (19).
Mechanisms involving Hh activation
The mechanism of Shh activation may be tumor-speciﬁc (4).
For BCCs or medulloblastomas, the pathway activation is
mutation driven but in other cancers it may be regulated by
autocrine or paracrine signaling. Constitutive activation of the
Hh signaling pathway in tumors involving lung, stomach,
esophagus, pancreas, prostate, breast, liver, and brain without
somatic mutations affecting the Hh signaling pathway genes
exhibits an autocrine, ligand-dependent activation of Hh signaling. Here, ectopic Hh ligand production in tumor cells or in a
small subset of cancer stem cells (CSC) may prolong survival of
the tumor cells, thereby contributing to overall tumor growth
(20). Aberrant paracrine signaling in prostate and pancreatic
models of carcinogenesis alters the tumor microenvironment
to enhance aggressive tumor growth (21). In contrast, in
hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia, Hh is directly secreted by the stromal
cells, which are required for the Bcl2-dependent survival of the
malignant B cells (22). Noncanonical Hh signaling involves
regulation of Hh pathway components independent of downstream Gli-mediated transcription or direct interaction of
these proteins with components of other molecular pathways
and/or involves atypical interaction of core Hh pathway components with one another. For example, PTCH1 can interact
directly with cyclin B1 and caspases. Shh-mediated regulation
of cell migration important for tumor invasion and metastasis
is independent of downstream components (reviewed in
refs. 4, 23). Nonetheless, the role of noncanonical (independent
of Gli transcription) Shh signaling in skin tumor growth
remains obscure.
Shh signaling crosstalk
Recent studies have highlighted the crosstalk between Hh
and other key oncogenic pathways (summarized in Fig. 2),

www.aacrjournals.org

among them include transforming growth factor beta (TGFb),
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth
factor (IGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and Wnt (24–29). We
recently showed that the coding region determinant–binding
protein (CRD-BP), a direct target of Wnt/b-catenin signaling,
binds with Gli1 mRNA and regulates BCC development (30).
Wang and colleagues (31) established a key role for crosstalk
between the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6
kinase 1(S6K1) and Hh pathways in the pathogenesis of
esophageal adenocarcinoma. The activated mTOR/S6K1 signaling promotes Gli1 transcriptional activity through S6K1mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, thereby releasing Gli1
from its endogenous inhibitor, Suppressor of Fused (SuFu).
Moreover, inhibition of mTOR pathway signaling by rapamycin
blocked S6K1 and augmented the cytocidal effects of the Hh
pathway inhibitor. It also blocked Shh signaling, thereby
inhibiting the growth of rhabdomyosarcomas in a mouse
xenograft assay (32). A role for SuFu and Kif7 has recently
been shown in the regulation of Gli2 in the pathogenesis of
BCCs (33). Identiﬁcation of four kinases, unc-51–like kinase 3
(Ulk3), kinesin family member 11 (Kif11), mitogen-activated
protein kinase 10 (Map3K10), and dual speciﬁcity tyrosine-(Y)phosphorylation–regulated kinase 2 (Dyrk2) with phenotype
similar to Fused (Fu) is interesting but their role in the
processing Hh signaling regulatory proteins remains to be
deﬁned (34–36).
Aberrant Hh also occurs during malignant progression. Yoo
and colleagues (37) showed that Hh signaling enhanced tumor
metastasis by driving epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) through activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway and
MMP-9. During this process, polarized epithelial cells are
transformed into motile mesenchymal cells, thereby facilitating invasiveness and metastasis. Hh signaling also enhances
EMT by upregulating the transcription factor Snail and downregulating E-cadherin. The vast majority of BCCs are locally
invasive and rarely metastasize (38). De Craene and colleagues
(39) showed that in vivo expression of Snail results in de novo
epithelial carcinogenesis (including BCCs) by allowing
enhanced survival, expansion of the CSC pool with accumulated DNA damage.
Primary cilium and Hh signaling
The primary cilium is a microtubule-based, membraneenclosed structure present in all vertebrate cells that is essential for mammalian Hh activation (Fig. 1). Recently, we have
veriﬁed its importance for skin and hair follicle homeostasis
(40). It is known that SMO, and the Glis both localize to primary
cilia in a manner gated by Hh pathway activity (41). This
translocation suppresses protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated
phosphorylation of Gli transcription factors and induces dissociation of Gli proteins from their inhibitor SuFu (42). PKAmediated phosphorylation of Glis is important in controlling
their tissue levels by targeting them to ubiquitination-dependent proteosomal degradation (43).
Ciliopathies is a term used to describe an emerging group of
diseases associated with aberrant ciliary function. Ellis–
van Creveld syndrome (EVC) or chondroectodermal dysplasia,

Figure 2. Hh pathway crosstalk with other signaling pathways. The Hh signaling pathway demonstrates complex crosstalk with multiple signaling pathways
that modulate cancer pathogenesis. The TNF–mTOR pathway activates Gli1 in an SMO-independent manner. Activated mTOR enhances Gli1 transcriptional
activity and oncogenic functions via S6K1-mediated Gli1 phosphorylation at Ser84, which helps to release Gli1 from SUFU. The IGF/PI3K/Akt pathway
regulates Gli1/2 activities involving modulation of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Glis and so are the EGFR/MEK/ERK or TGFb signaling pathways. In
addition, TGFb can directly induce Gli2 expression independent of Hh signaling and requires Smad3. Wnt signaling also modulates Hh activity although
the underlying cascade remains unclear. CRD-BP, a direct target of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, can bind with Gli1 mRNA promoting tumor growth. Hh signaling
can also regulate Wnt signaling through modulation of b-catenin. aPKC-i/l acts downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate Gli1, resulting in its

congenital heart defects, and short-limbed dwarﬁsm among
other abnormalities (44). A closely related disorder is Weyer
acrofacial dysostosis (WAF) that is inherited in an autosomal
dominant pattern and is characterized by abnormalities of the
teeth and nails, extranummary digits and moderately restricted growth (45, 46). Many of these abnormalities occur in
patients with NBCCS. Ciliary dysfunction in EVC has been
linked to a mutation in two adjacent genes on chromosome 4
known as EVC and EVC2 that participate in the development of
cilia (46). The EVC gene encodes for EVC protein, whereas EVC2
codes for another protein called limbin. EVC2 mutations also
underlie WAF (47).
Following Shh stimulation, Ptch1 suppression of Smo is
relieved allowing its translocation to the primary cilium. This
translocation of Smo to the primary cilium is essential for Shhmediated downstream signaling. In mice, intraﬂagellar transport (IFT) component IFT172 is required for targeting SMO to

cilia (48). Dorn and colleagues (47) have identiﬁed an SMO–
EVC2 signaling complex that localizes to the EvC zone in a
distinct portion of the membrane compartment in primary
cilia. This is a critical transduction step between SMO and
PKA/SuFu (suppression of Gli proteolytic processing), and
results in the inhibition of Gli3 repressor formation (recruitment of Gli proteins and SuFu to the tips of cilia) and the
induction of activated Gli2 and Gli3 (47). In addition, Yang and
colleagues (49) demonstrated that Hh activates SMO by inducing its phosphorylation, which recruits EVC/EVC2 to activate
Gli proteins by antagonizing Sufu. More recently, Pusapati and
colleagues (50) have identiﬁed a complex between two ciliary
proteins EF-hand calcium-binding domain 7 (EFCAB7) and IQ
domain-containing protein E (IQCE) that positively regulates
Hh signaling (Fig. 1). ECFAB7–IQCE anchors the EVC/EVC2
in a signaling microdomain at the base of the primary cilium
(50). It is also known that cilia are unique calcium signaling

organelles regulated by a heteromeric transient receptor potential channel polycystic kidney disease 1–like 1 (PKD1L1)–
PKD2L1 that controls ciliary Ca2þ concentration and regulates
SMO-activated Gli2 translocation and Gli1 activation (51).
Murine models
Murine models of skin carcinogenesis have been major
contributors to current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of nonmelanoma skin cancers, including BCCs and
SCCs (12). In particular, murine models of BCCs have clariﬁed
the role of Hh signaling in the development of this tumor
(reviewed in refs. 4, 12). In a major advance, Oro and colleagues
(52) developed Ptchþ/ knockout mice that have proven
extremely useful in expanding knowledge of the pathogenesis
and prevention of UVB-induced BCCs. These animals were
engineered by deleting exons 1 and 2 and inserting the Lac Z
reporter gene at the deleted site. These animals spontaneously
develop only a few BCCs, similar to the pattern of growth of
sporadic BCCs in humans. They also display rarely some
phenotypic characteristics of patients with NBCCS. Exposure
of these mice to ultraviolet B (UVB) and X-ray greatly augments
the growth of BCCs (53).
One example of the utility of these mice is their potential
usefulness in deﬁning crosstalk in cancer-relevant signaling
pathways. For example, we previously showed that increased
expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enhances the
proliferation of BCC cells using Ptchþ/ mice overexpressing
K6-driven ODC. These mice developed a few macroscopic
BCC-like lesions spontaneously, and following chronic exposure to UVB developed lesions over the dorsal skin in a pattern
similar to that seen in patients with NBCCS (54). An alternate
approach for assessing Hh downstream target genes in the
pathogenesis of BCCs was the development of transgenic mice
overexpressing K5 promoter–driven Gli1 or Gli2. These animals exhibited multiple BCC-like lesions on the ears, tail, trunk,
and dorsal aspects of the paws. Albino mice showed characteristics of sporadic human BCCs, whereas pigmented strains
exhibited features of pigmented BCCs (55).
Regulation of stemness
Hh signaling can also regulate the self-renewal of CSCs. CSCs
are slow-growing cells that often manifest resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiation protocols. This seems
to facilitate cancer relapse after tumor debulking by conventional therapeutic modalities. Thus, Hh inhibition offers a
mechanism-driven approach to inhibiting tumor-forming
CSCs, ideally in combination with other conventional cancer
treatment modalities. Colmont and colleagues (56) isolated
BCC cells from human tumors and identiﬁed a small subpopulation of CD200þCD45 cells comprising 1.63%  1.11% of all
BCC cells residing at the tumor periphery. In tumor xenografts,
tumor-initiating cell (TIC) frequencies approximate one per 1.5
million unsorted BCC cells. These CD200þCD45 BCC cells
recreated BCC tumor growth in vivo with as few as 10,000 cells
whereas CD200CD45 BCC cells formed no tumors. These
data suggest that CSCs exist as subpopulations of BCC TICs
that could be targeted to reduce tumor recurrence when Hh
inhibitors are discontinued.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of resistance to
anticancer therapy. MDR enhances drug efﬂux from cancer
cells mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family. Sims-Mourtada and colleagues (57) have
shown that Hh signaling blockade increases the response of
cancer cells to numerous forms of chemotherapy by regulating
ABC transporter proteins. These results suggest that the Hh
pathway may be a target to overcome MDR, thereby increasing
the chemotherapeutic response.
Inhibitors of Shh signaling pathway
Cyclopamine was the ﬁrst Shh inhibitor identiﬁed and has
proven useful to complement genetic experiments verifying
the growth-promoting/tumorigenic role of Hh signaling (For
review please see (4, 12, 58). Cyclopamine was shown to bind
with SMO and antagonize its downstream signal transducing
functions (59). Using a UVB-induced BCC photocarcinogenesis
murine model, our group was the ﬁrst to show that cyclopamine prevents BCCs (60). Trials assessing its feasibility for
human use revealed multiple drawbacks, including low water
solubility, weak SMO afﬁnity, poor oral bioavailability and
suboptimal pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, nonspeciﬁc cytotoxicity, off-target apoptosis inducing effects with
troubling side effects (61–64).
As the role of aberrant Hh signaling in multiple forms
of potentially lethal malignancies unfolded, these efforts were
redoubled, leading to the discovery of several small molecules
(Fig. 1), including SANT1–SANT4, CUR-61414, HhAntag-691,
GDC-0449, MK4101, IPI-926, BMS-833923, and others (only a
few of them are discussed here due to space constraints;
refs. 4, 12). On the basis of preclinical assays, Hh-blocking
antibodies that act upstream of SMO such as the 5E1 monoclonal antibody that binds to Shh ligand and disrupts protein
binding to the receptor Ptch (Fig. 1) seem promising (4).
Another strategy seeks mimetics of various natural Shh inhibitors such as Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip), SUFU,
etc., and agents (GANT61 and GANT58) that act on downstream
Gli proteins (Fig. 1; ref. 4). We have shown the importance of
Hhip in the pathogenesis and prevention of BCCs (65). Robotnikinin, a small molecule that binds with the Shh protein may be
an approach to inhibit Shh signaling in tumor stromal cells (Fig.
1; ref. 66). Recently, Atwood and colleagues (67) showed that an
atypical protein kinase C i/l (aPKC-i/l) acts as a novel regulator
of Gli (Fig. 2). The concept here is that targeting aPKC-i/l in
SMO inhibitor–resistant BCCs could be efﬁcacious (67).
In a screen of drugs previously tested in humans, Kim and
colleagues (68) identiﬁed itraconazole, a systemic imidazole
antifungal, as a potent antagonist of the Hh signaling pathway
that acts to inhibit SMO by a mechanism distinct from that of
other SMO antagonists (Fig. 1). It prevents the ciliary accumulation of SMO that follows Hh stimulation (68). Itraconazole
suppressed Hh pathway activity and the growth of Hh-driven
medulloblastoma in a mouse allograft model at serum levels
comparable with those found in patients undergoing antifungal treatment with the drug. Recently, this drug showed some
efﬁcacy in a clinical trial against BCCs in NBCCS (69). Arsenic
trioxide (ATO) has been FDA-approved for the treatment of
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), since 2000. ATO inhibits

growth of Hh pathway–driven medulloblastoma allografts
derived from Ptchþ/p53/ mice within a range of serum
levels comparable with those achieved in treating human APL
(70). Similarly, arsenic can block Hh-induced ciliary accumulation of Gli2 (71). In addition, it can also directly bind with Gli1
and can inhibit its activity independent of primary cilia (Fig. 1;
ref. 72). Tang and colleagues (73) showed that Vitamin D3
inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and Hh signaling with efﬁcacy matching that of cyclopamine. These Hh inhibitory effects
are Vitamin D receptor independent. Topical application of
Vitamin D3 to murine BCCs decreased Gli1 and Ki67 staining
(73). Interestingly, patients with NBCCS are frequently Vitamin
D deﬁcient (74).

Clinical Trials with Small Molecular Weight
Inhibitors of Shh Signaling
Over the past 15 years, we have conducted several clinical
trials to assess the efﬁcacy and safety of mechanism-driven
agents capable of targeting various components of the Hh
signaling pathway (Fig. 1) and various Hh-unrelated molecular
targets as an approach to inhibit the growth of BCCs in patients
with NBCCS (75–78). However, in these studies as well as those
done by others, efforts with Hh inhibition proved more effective than blocking other Shh signaling-unrelated molecular
targets (75, 76).
Topical formulations
The antitumor efﬁcacy of topically applied cyclopamine was
evaluated in patients with BCCs who were scheduled for
surgical excision of the tumor (77). All of the cyclopaminetreated tumors regressed clinically and reduced cell proliferation and enhanced differentiation and apoptosis of tumor
cells, were conﬁrmed histologically (77). Topically applied
CUR61414, an SMO inhibitor, was ineffective (78). Another
SMO inhibitor, LDE225 in a double-blind, randomized, vehiclecontrolled, intraindividual study in human subject showed
limited therapeutic efﬁcacy (79).
Oral agents
Vismodegib (GDC-0449) is structurally related to cyclopamine and a potent Smo inhibitor. Several multicenter trials
have been conducted with orally administered vismodegib. In a
phase I clinical trial, the safety and pharmacokinetics were
tested in patients with metastatic or locally advanced BCCs.
The median duration of the study was 9.8 months and 18 of 33
patients had an objective response to drug (80). Another phase
I trial in 68 patients with solid tumors refractory to current
therapies or for which no standard therapy existed, was conducted. Adverse events, tumor responses, pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics, and downmodulation of Gli1 expression
in noninvolved skin were assessed. On the basis of this study,
the recommended daily dose was 150 mg/d (81). Less frequent
administration of the drug showed comparable safety, tolerability, and steady-state levels of total and unbound vismodegib as continuous daily dosing (82).
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vismodegib in patients with NBCCS at three
clinical centers. The primary end-point was reduction in the

4972

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

incidence of new surgically eligible BCCs (SEB) with vismodegib versus placebo after 3 months; secondary end points
included reduction in the size of existing BCCs. In 41
patients followed for a mean of 8 months (range, 1–15) after
enrollment, the per patient rate of new SEBs was lower with
vismodegib than with placebo (2 vs. 29 cases/group/year,
P < 0.001), as was the size (the percentage of change from
baseline in the sum of the longest diameter) of existing SEBs
(65% vs. 11%, P ¼ 0.003). In some patients, all BCCs
clinically regressed and no tumors progressed during treatment with vismodegib. Patients receiving vismodegib
reported grade 1 or 2 adverse events of dysgeusia (loss of
taste), muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss. Overall,
54% of patients (14 of 26) receiving vismodegib discontinued
drug treatment due to adverse events. At 1 month, vismodegib use had reduced Shh target gene expression in BCCs
by 90% (P < 0.001) and diminished tumor cell proliferation,
but apoptosis was unchanged. No residual BCC tumor was
histologically detectable in 83% of biopsy samples taken
from sites of clinically regressed BCCs (83).
Another multicenter, international, two-cohort, nonrandomized study of vismodegib, was conducted in patients with
metastatic BCC or with locally advanced BCC with inoperable
disease or for whom surgery was inappropriate. In 33 patients
with metastatic BCC, the independently assessed response
rate was 30% whereas in 63 patients with locally advanced BCC,
the independently assessed response rate was 43%. The median
duration of response was 7.6 months in both cohorts (84).
On the basis of these preclinical and clinical investigations,
vismodegib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of
recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic BCCs (85). Several
vismodegib-treated patients in these trials developed invasive
keratoacanthomas by an unknown mechanism (86, 87). Thus,
patients receiving this drug should be monitored carefully for
this complication.
In addition to the risk of developing keratoacanthomas, a
major challenge with vismodegib is the rapid development of
drug resistance that limits its efﬁcacy (88). Induction of new
mutations in Smo seems to be responsible for the acquired
resistance. Yauch and colleagues (88) identiﬁed this mutation
as a heterozygous G-to-C missense mutation at position 1697
predicted to change codon 473 from Asp to His. Although this
mutant was found to be competent to transduce Hh signaling,
it led to loss of SMO binding by vismodegib (88). It was also
shown that the PI3K pathway is upregulated in these refractory
tumors and PI3K inhibition may signiﬁcantly delay tumor
growth (89).

Summary and Future Prospects
Aberrant Shh signaling is the major driver of both sporadic
BCCs and the BCCs that occur in patients with NBCCS as well
as many other tumors in which this pathway is activated.
Additional Hh signaling modifying proteins seem to be capable
of modulating the growth of these tumors in a noncanonical
setting. Hh signaling is not considered important in the
initiation of other common epidermal cancers such as SCCs
but may be involved in the later stages of tumor growth or in

BCCs Development in Gorlin Syndrome

the development of speciﬁc subtypes of SCCs showing altered
differentiation patterns. The growth of BCCs may also use
crosstalk with other signaling pathways such as mTOR, PI3K–
Akt, and/or Wnt. Clariﬁcation of the mechanistic basis for such
crosstalk may help to identify additional novel targets that
could inhibit tumor growth. SMO inhibitors have been shown
to have substantial antitumor efﬁcacy in sporadic and NBCCSassociated BCCs. Unfortunately, SMO resistance develops
rapidly in many instances (88, 90). In this regard, a search for
agents capable of inhibiting SMO by identifying new binding
sites could prove useful. Furthermore, targets downstream of
SMO such as Gli could also have potential, although none have
yet been shown to be clinically effective. Exploration of novel
approaches to inhibiting this pathway could prove useful in

other epithelial/hematologic neoplasms in which Hh signaling
is known to play key roles in tumor development. In this regard,
combinational approaches using therapeutic agents targeting
other pathways that drive the growth of these tumors should
also be explored.
