Abstract
Lipid rafts are membrane platforms that spatially organize
molecules for specific signaling pathways that regulate
various cellular functions. Cholesterol is critical for liquidordered raft formation by serving as a spacer between the
hydrocarbon chains of sphingolipids, and alterations in the
cholesterol contents of the plasma membrane causes disruption of rafts. The role that S receptors play in cancer is not
clear, although it is frequently up-regulated in human cancer
cells and tissues and S receptors inhibit proliferation in
carcinoma and melanoma cell lines, induce apoptosis in colon
and mammary carcinoma cell lines, and reduce cellular
adhesion in mammary carcinoma cell lines. In this study, we
provide molecular and functional evidence for the involvement of the enigmatic S1 receptors in lipid raft modeling by
S1 receptor–mediated cholesterol alteration of lipid rafts in
breast cancer cell lines. Cholesterol binds to cholesterol
recognition domains in the COOH terminus of the S1 receptor.
This binding is blocked by S receptor drugs because the
cholesterol-binding domains form part of the S receptor drugbinding site, mutations of which abolish cholesterol binding.
Furthermore, we outline a hypothetical functional model to
explain the myriad of biological processes, including cancer,
in which these mysterious receptors are involved. The findings
of this study provide a biological basis for the potential
therapeutic applications of lipid raft cholesterol regulation in
cancer therapy using S receptor drugs. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells form liquid-ordered
microdomains enriched with cholesterol and sphingomyelin that
spatially organize molecules for specific signaling pathways that
regulate a variety of processes (1). j Receptors were first thought to
be a novel type of opiate receptor (2); subsequent studies showed
that the j receptors were able to bind a variety of pharmacologically effective drugs, including benzomorphans, neuroleptics,
antidepressants, cocaine, peptides related to neuropeptide Y, and
neurosteroids ( for review, see ref. 3), although intriguingly no
known natural specific ligand(s) have been discovered. The j
receptors have been classified into three subtypes; thus far, the only
gene that has been cloned is the r1 receptor subtype (4, 5). The j1

receptor protein does not share any homology with any known
mammalian protein; however, it has some amino acid homology
with yeast sterol isomerases (4). The j1 receptors are transmembrane proteins that are reported to be localized to plasma
membranes (6, 7), perinuclear areas, and in regions of cell-to-cell
communication (8) and are proposed to possess cytoplasmic NH2
and COOH termini (6). However, j1 receptor drugs trigger
translocation of the j1 receptor from the cytosol to the vicinity
of the cell membrane, indicating the dynamic nature of this
receptor localization (9). Splice variants of the j1 receptor were
found to be nonfunctional in drug-binding assays, suggesting that
the drug-binding site is located within the COOH terminus (10).
Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified two
amino acids in the COOH terminus, D126 and E172, that are
obligatory for ligand binding (11).
Sigma receptors are implicated pharmacologically in a multitude
of functions, disorders, and cellular processes (6, 12, 13).
Surprisingly, the j1 receptor knockout mouse shows no obvious
phenotype (14, 15). The role that j1 receptors play in cancer is not
clear ( for review, see ref. 16), although it is frequently up-regulated
in human cancer cells and tissues (7, 16, 17) and j receptors inhibit
proliferation in carcinoma and melanoma cell lines, induce
apoptosis in colon and mammary carcinoma cell lines, and reduce
cellular adhesion in mammary carcinoma cell lines ( for review, see
ref. 16). Moreover, numerous preclinical studies have evaluated the
usefulness of radiolabeled j drugs (particularly j2 receptor drugs),
as tumor-imaging agents (16).
Experiments indicate that G proteins or protein phosphorylation
(18, 19) do not mediate j1 receptor responses and that signal
transduction requires close proximity between the receptor and its
target molecule (18). Recently, the presence of j1 receptors in both
raft and nonraft fractions was shown (20), and it was postulated
that j1 receptors cause the remodeling of lipid rafts, by increasing
the level of lipid raft–associated cholesterol through an unknown
mechanism (21). Moreover, Hayashi and Su (22) proposed that j1
receptors are involved in regulation of galactosylceramide-enriched
lipid microdomains and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the
nervous system. Hayashi and Su (23) found j1 receptors in
detergent-resistant microdomains, which differed from those of
classic, glycosphingolipid-containing lipid rafts in that they
possessed a higher buoyant density than classic lipid rafts but
retained high cholesterol content. Interestingly, both j1 receptors
and lipid raft levels are elevated in cancer cell lines (7, 24).

Cell culture. Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and human
embryonic kidney cell line (HEK) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) containing
10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mmol/L glutamine with penicillinstreptomycin. All cell lines were maintained in a 37jC CO2 incubator in
100-mm culture dishes. For certain adhesion experiments, cells were plated

onto dishes containing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (collagen, fibronectin, or laminin). Plates were coated in a solution containing 125 Ag/mL
of ECM protein in PBS for 1 h at 37jC before washing thrice with PBS and
once with DMEM.
Expression and purification of S1 receptor from HEK cells. The j1
receptor gene was cloned into pCDNA3.1-c-myc (Invitrogen) so that a
c-myc tag was fused to the COOH terminus. The plasmid was transfected
into 100-mm culture dishes containing HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. As a control, an empty plasmid was also transfected into
HEK cells. Four days posttransfection, j1 receptor tagged with c-myc was
purified from these cells using a Profound c-myc tag purification kit
(Pierce).
Drugs, buffers, reagents, and antibodies. SKF10047 (Sigma), the
prototypical j1 receptor drug, was used at a concentration of 100 Amol/L,
which has been shown to be the optimal concentration when used in wholecell situations (7). Please note that the j receptor drug concentrations used
for functional assays on whole cells are higher than concentrations for
radiolabeled j receptor agonists used in ‘‘receptor binding’’ studies on
isolated membrane preparations. Buffers are listed in Supplementary
Material.
The following peptides were obtained from Biopeptide:
j1161-180(myc) EQKLISEEDLAVEWGPNTWMVEYGRGVIPS,
j1161-180(myc)Y173S EQKLISEEDLAVEWGPNTWMVESGRGVIPS,
j1191-210(myc) EQKLISEEDLFSTQDFLTLFYTLRSYARGL,
j1191-210(myc)Y201/6S EQKLISEEDLFSTQDFLTLFSTLRSSARGL,
Env686-705(myc) EQKLISEEDLFDITNWLWYIRLFIMIVGGL, and
Env686-705 FDITNWLWYIRLFIMIVGGL.
All peptides were initially dissolved in PBS or PBS with 10% DMSO at
1 mg/mL j1 receptor antibody as described previously (7). Other antibodies
were obtained from commercial suppliers as detailed in Supplementary
Material.
Immunostaining of cells for B1 integrin. Detailed protocol listed is in
Supplementary Material. Cells were visualized on a Leica DMIRB confocal
with a 100 objective, and analysis was performed with Leica confocal
software.
Protein assays. Samples in a volume of 100 AL were applied to
nitrocellulose membrane using a slot blotting apparatus. The blots were
blocked with a solution containing 2.5% skimmed milk and 2.5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in PBST overnight at 4jC before probing with specific
antibodies.
Protein samples generally at a concentration of 1 mg/mL were mixed
with SDS sample buffer (Sigma) and 5 Ag of protein were loaded per lane
and separated on acrylamide 4% to 20% gradient Tris-glycine minigels
(Cambrex). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for
2 to 4 h at 4jC; transfer was verified using Ponceau red (Sigma) and the
blots were blocked with a solution containing 2.5% skimmed milk and 2.5%
BSA in TBST overnight at 4jC before probing with specific antibodies.
Immunoblots (slot or Western) were probed with antibodies to various
epitopes. The antibodies were diluted to 1 Ag/mL in PBST with 0.5%
skimmed milk and 0.5% BSA and incubated with the blot for 4 h at room
temperature. Following four 10-min washes with PBST (with constant
agitation) at room temperature, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (at
the manufacturers’ suggested concentrations) as appropriate, and diluted in
PBST with 0.5% skimmed milk and 0.5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature.
The blots were again washed as before and then developed with an
enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot kit (Amersham). All blots were
quantified using NIH IMAGE. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with
a kit from Pierce. As controls, the immunoprecipitation was performed in
the absence of immunoprecipitation antibody (either j1 receptor or h1
integrin) and with beads without protein A attached (to verify nonspecific
binding of proteins).
Isolation of lipid raft microdomains, lipid raft staining, and
cholesterol assays. About 1  108 cells were washed twice in PBS and

then treated on ice with 2 mL of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 in
25 mmol/L Tris-HCl and 140 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.0). The lysis buffer
contained a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche
Diagnostics). Cells were left on ice for 20 to 30 min to lyse, and then
centrifuged at 10,000  g for 5 min at 4jC to obtain the postnuclear
fraction. The quantity of protein in this fraction was calculated using a
Bio-Rad protein estimation kit. The postnuclear lysate was adjusted to
50 mg of total protein in 40% (w/v) sucrose and then a 5% to 30%
discontinuous sucrose gradient was layered on the top. Typically, 4 mL of
30% sucrose and 3 mL of 5% sucrose were layered on a 3 mL sample in
40% sucrose in a centrifuge tube. Gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at
175,000  g in an SW41 rotor at 4jC. Fractions of 1 mL (typically
10 fractions in total) were collected from the top of the gradient and
stored at 80jC. Lipid raft labeling uses a fluorescently labeled cholera
toxin subunit B (CT-B), which binds to the pentasaccharide chain of
plasma membrane ganglioside GM1, which selectively partitions into lipid
rafts. An antibody that specifically recognizes CT-B is then used to crosslink the CT-B–labeled lipid rafts into distinct patches on the plasma
membrane, which are visualized by fluorescence microscopy after fixing of
the cells with paraformaldehyde. These reagents were provided in a
Vybrant Lipid Raft Labeling Kit from Invitrogen. Cholesteryl hemisuccinate
was immobilized on diaminodipropylamine agarose (Pierce) with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Sigma). At the same time, diaminodipropylamine
agarose was reacted without cholesteryl hemisuccinate to serve as a
control for nonspecific binding. Beads were blocked in 5% (lipid-free) BSA
in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were stored in PBS with 0.02%
NaN3 at 4jC as 50% bead/PBS slurry. Peptides or proteins were dissolved
in 100 AL of PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and mixed with 100 AL of
cholesteryl beads (or control beads) for 2 h at room temperature. The
beads were washed thrice with PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 using Handee
spin cup columns (Pierce), and bound peptides/proteins were eluted by
incubating the beads with 100 AL of SDS-PAGE buffer (Sigma) at 80jC for
5 min. Cholesterol was assayed spectrophotometrically using a cholesterol/
cholesterol ester quantitation kit (BioVision).

See Supplementary Material.
S1 Receptor gene silencing. A j1 receptor gene silencing vector was
constructed using the pSilencer RNAi vector (Ambion) as described
previously, which affects both j1 receptor mRNA and protein levels
without effecting basal gene expression levels (7). As a control, a j1
receptor RNAi randomized sequence was constructed in pSilencer.
Transfection was accomplished using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Transfection efficiency was verified by
cotransfecting a green fluorescence protein–expressing plasmid. Silencing
efficiency was quantified by protein extraction from cultures 4 days
posttransfection and slot blotting 5 Ag of total cell protein onto
nitrocellulose followed by detection using a j1 receptor–specific antibody
and an antiactinin antibody (as control for nonspecific effects on
gene expression; Supplementary Fig. S1). Additionally, mRNA levels
were detected for the j1 receptor using reverse transcription-PCR as
described previously (7). Silencing efficiencies of >70% were usually
obtained.
Single-cell adhesion measuring assay. This process has been described
previously (7).
Biotin surface labeling. Cells (1  107) were washed in cold PBS and
incubated for 2 h at 4jC with 10 mg/mL sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Molecular
Probes) in binding buffer, 50 mmol/L NaHCO3 (pH 8.5). The remaining
reactive sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was blocked by adding 2 vol of 100 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and by further incubation for 1 h. Cells were harvested by
incubation twice in cold PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 min and once in PBS, containing
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L DTT,
with protease inhibitors. The cells were scraped from the dish, and cell
debris was removed by centrifugation at 300  g for 20 min at 4jC.
Biotinylated proteins were purified using Immunopure-immobilized avidin
(Pierce). As a control, biotinylated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE,
Western blotted, and probed with antibodies to actin to verify nonlabeling
of internal proteins.

Results
The S1 receptor contains cholesterol-binding motifs in its
COOH terminus. j1 Receptors are predicted to have at least one
(4) or two transmembrane domains (amino acids 9–28 and 81–101;
ref. 6) and intracellular NH2 and COOH termini (6). Transmembrane predictions reveal a further possible region of transmembrane helices (amino acid residues 176–203; Fig. 1A), which contain
cholesterol-binding domain (CBD) motifs of the sequence L/V-X1-5Y-X1-5-K/R as described in the benzodiazepine receptor (25) and

the HIV envelope protein (26). The sequences VEYGR (single CBD)
and LFYTLRSYAR (two overlapping CBDs) from the j1 receptor are
presented schematically in a revised model for the j1 receptor in
Fig. 1B. Also shown are amino acid residues known to be obligatory
for j1 receptor drug binding and the splice sites of a non–drug
binding splice variant (10, 11).
Do S1 receptors bind cholesterol? Because j receptors are
reported to be localized to lipid rafts, it is highly likely that they
are associated with cholesterol. Therefore, we attempted to
produce an assay that is capable of determining true cholesterol
binding instead of mere association in a membrane. A c-myc–
tagged j1 receptor (j1-myc) construct was transfected into the
HEK mammalian cell line, and the protein was purified through
its myc tag. As expected, bands of f26 kDa were observed upon

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Cholesterol was
immobilized to beads (27) and used to study j1 receptor binding
to cholesterol as described previously for the HIV envelope
protein, which also contains a CBD (26). j1-myc pure protein at a
concentration of 100 ng/mL was found to bind to cholesterol
beads but not to control beads (Fig. 2B). As a positive control, a
known cholesterol-binding peptide Env686-705myc (26) with a myc
tag attached was also tested (9 ng/mL). This cholesterol-binding
peptide Env686-705 (without a myc tag) at a 100-fold molar excess
was found to block binding of j1-myc protein to cholesterol,
indicating that the j1 receptor binds specifically to cholesterol
(Fig. 2B). As a negative control, a glutathione S-transferase protein
with a myc tag was also tested. The j1 receptor drug SKF10047
(at a 100 Amol/L concentration, f25-fold molar excess) was

found to block the binding of j1-myc to cholesterol beads
(Fig. 2B) by 80% (F = 270, P = 3.2  10 6, n = 5), demonstrating
that the cholesterol-binding sites of the j1 receptor form part of
the drug-binding site for this receptor. Peptides spanning the j1
receptor CBD motifs were synthesized (Fig. 1A) with myc tags
attached (j1161-180myc and j1191-210myc). These peptides at a
concentration of 13.5 ng/mL were found to bind to cholesterol
beads (Fig. 2C). The binding of these peptides to cholesterol beads
was blocked by the cholesterol-binding peptide Env686-705 (used at
a 100-fold molar excess; Fig. 2C). SKF10047 (100 Amol/L) reduced
the binding of these peptides to cholesterol beads by a small
amount, 39% (F = 58, P = 1.6  10 3, n = 5) and 33% (F = 43,
P = 2.8  10 3, n = 5), respectively (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the CBD
from the benzodiazepine receptor revealed that mutation of the

tyrosine in the sequence L/V-X1-5-Y-X1-5-K/R abolished binding to
cholesterol (25). j1 Receptor peptides j1161-180myc and j1191-210myc
were synthesized with Y173S and double Y201/6S mutations,
respectively. The binding of these mutated peptides to cholesterol
beads was abolished (n = 3; Fig. 2D), indicating that the
cholesterol-binding site lies close to these amino acid residues.
Molecular modeling of S1 receptor cholesterol-binding
peptides and predicted cholesterol docking. To understand
the ability of the j1 receptor to bind cholesterol, molecular
modeling studies were undertaken on the cholesterol-binding
peptides j1161-180 and j1191-210. To determine the cholesterol-j1
receptor interaction, the following aspects must be considered: (a)
cholesterol is a planar molecule, thus offering a limited number of
conformations; (b) its length corresponds to about three helix
turns; and (c) its small polar head, a hydroxyl group, should be
located at the boundary region of the membrane interface (i.e.,
close to R175 and R208 in our model; ref. 25). All these features
simplify the search for docking sites for cholesterol. Almost all the
bulky side chains (F, L, or V) are gathered on one helix side of both
peptides, which can thus be ruled out for steric hindrance reasons
as a part of a cholesterol-binding site. The results show that both
peptides may form a pocket where cholesterol could dock (Fig. 3A
and B). This pocket is absent in the mutated peptides (data shown
only for j1191-210 Y173S), predicting the lack of interaction of these
sequences with cholesterol (Fig. 3A). Computational docking
simulations indicated that, indeed, cholesterol could dock in the
pocket of the target most likely in the vicinity of Y173 and Y206
(which is in agreement with the mutational studies) with the polar
group of cholesterol rationally buried in the lipid membrane.
Docking of cholesterol was not possible in the vicinity of peptides
with Y173S or Y201/6S mutations (data shown only for j1191-210
Y173S). These results are in concordance to the results obtained for
the docking of cholesterol to the CBD of the benzodiazepine
receptor (25). Docking of cholesterol within the vicinity of Y201 in

j1191-210 was possible but resulted in the hydroxyl group being
exposed to an aqueous environment (data not shown).
Physiologic implications of the S1 receptors ability to bind
cholesterol. The j receptors have been implicated in a multitude
of cellular functions (3, 13, 16). It has been shown that either j1
receptor drugs or j1 gene silencing reduce cellular adhesion in
mammary carcinoma cell lines (7). In this study, we chose to study
the mechanism through which j1 receptors can affect the adhesion
of cancer cells in light of our experiments, demonstrating the
ability of the j1 receptor to bind cholesterol. As previously
reported, SKF10047 significantly reduces the adhesion of MDA-MB231 cells (7) and h1 integrin plays a significant role in the adhesion
of MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cell line (28). Application of
SKF10047 or a h1 integrin blocking antibody for 2 h significantly
reduced the adhesion by 72% (F = 49, P = 1.4  10 11, N = 140, n = 3)
and 88% (F = 84, P = 0, N = 140, n = 3; Fig. 4A). Dual application of
SKF10047 and h1 integrin blocking antibody did not significantly
alter the adhesion compared with h1 integrin blocking antibody
alone (F = 0.01, P = 0.94, N = 140, n = 3). As previously reported, j1
receptor silencing significantly reduced the adhesion of MDAMB-231 cells (7). In this study, we observed a 49% reduction (F = 13,
P = 3.8  10 4, N = 109, n = 3) in adhesion; however, as for the
SKF10047 experiments above, dual j1 receptor silencing and h1
integrin blocking did not significantly alter the adhesion compared
with h1 integrin blocking alone (F = 0.9, P = 0.34, N = 110, n = 3;
Fig. 4A). Both of these results indicate that h1 integrin blocking and
j1 receptor drugs or j1 receptor gene silencing have a similar
effect. Because dual treatments of h1 integrin blocking and j1
receptor modulation (with SKF10047 or gene silencing) was not
significantly different from h1 integrin blocking alone, we propose
that j1 receptors may be altering cellular adhesion in MDA-MB231 cells by effecting h1 integrin.
h1 integrin heterodimers are receptors for collagen, fibronectin,
and laminin. Therefore, we also tested the effect of SKF10047

Figure 4. Effect of j receptors on
h1 integrin–mediated cell adhesion.
A, MDA-MB-231 cells were either treated
with SKF10047, a h1 integrin blocking
antibody (Ab ), or both for 2 h; the adhesion
was measured using single-cell adhesion
measuring assay compared with untreated
control cells. In a separate experiment, the

and the adhesion was measured using
single-cell adhesion measuring assay.
B, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated onto

cells to these substrates. As expected, the adhesion of MDA-MB-231
cells seeded onto dishes coated with collagen, fibronectin, or
laminin increased compared with cells plated onto uncoated dishes
(Fig. 4B). Treatment of cells with SKF10047 produced a greater
reduction in adhesion (78%, N = 50, n = 3) for cells seeded onto
plates coated with collagen compared with cells seeded onto
uncoated dishes (63%, N = 50, n = 3; Fig. 4B). Also, the reduction in
adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells upon j1 receptor RNAi (76%, N = 50,
n = 3) on dishes coated with collagen was greater than on cells
seeded into uncoated dishes (48%, N = 50, n = 3; Fig. 4B). Similar
results were obtained with dishes coated with fibronectin and
laminin (Fig. 4B). These results strengthen our hypothesis that j1
receptors may be altering cellular adhesion in MDA-MB-231 cells

which extracts cholesterol from the membrane, then adhesion is
dramatically reduced (Fig. 4C ). Subsequent treatment with
SKF10047 did not reduce the adhesion compared with untreated
cells (N = 50, n = 3; Fig. 4C). Similarly for cyclodextrin-treated cells,
j1 receptor RNAi did not reduce the adhesion of MDA-MB-231
cells compared with control RNAi (N = 50, n = 3; Fig. 4D). These
data suggest that if lipid rafts composition is disrupted, j1
receptors are unable to affect cellular adhesion. It seems plausible
that j1 receptor antagonism or interference inhibit breast cancer
cell adhesion by displacing j1 receptors and h1 integrin outside
lipid rafts, the same as methyl-h-cyclodextrin.

The effect of j1 receptors on h1 integrin was investigated. In
SKF10047-treated cells or j1 receptor–silenced cells, no significant
difference in surface h1 integrin staining was observed compared
with untreated or control cells (Fig. 5A; F = 0.3, P = 0.3, N = 300, n = 3).

n = 5) or surface expressed (surface biotinylated) h1 integrin (Fig.
5B; F = 0.02, P = 0.99, n = 5), indicating that neither application of
SKF10047 nor j1 receptor silencing changed the surface expression
of h1 integrin. Immunoprecipitations were performed and the j1
receptor was found to coimmunoprecipitate with h1 integrin and
visa versa (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, although the presence of
SKF10047 did not effect total j1 receptor levels, the levels of j1
receptor that coimmunoprecipitated with h1 integrin were
significantly reduced by 87% upon application of SKF10047
(Fig. 5D; F = 422, P = 3.3  10 5, n = 5). Similarly, the levels of
h1 integrin that coimmunoprecipitated with the j1 receptor were
significantly reduced upon application of SKF10047 by 54%
(Supplementary Fig. S2; F = 602, P = 1.6, n = 3).
Effect of S1 receptors on lipid raft membranes. MDA-MB-231
cells were either treated with SKF10047 or the j1 receptor was

silenced using RNAi. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and
lipid raft fractions were prepared. Each fraction was slot blotted to
nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies to h1 integrin (which is
found in raft and nonraft fractions; ref. 29), flottillin (a lipid raft
resident protein), or Na+/K+-ATPase (a nonraft protein; Fig. 6A). All
antibodies were previously tested in SDS-PAGE and Western blots
to ensure the specificity of antibody binding and the absence of
nonspecific bands. Results are shown in Fig. 6B; a reduction of the
levels of h1 integrin in the lipid raft fractions ( fractions 4 and 5)
was noted upon SKF10047 application by 43% (F = 120, P = 3.9 
10 4, n = 3) or j1 receptor silencing by 41% (F = 49, P = 2.2  10 3,
n = 3), showing that in the presence of SKF10047 or j1 receptor
silencing, h1 integrin moves from lipid raft fractions to nonraft
fractions. Additionally, the SKF10047-treated and untreated cells
were slot blotted and probed with a j1 receptor antibody (Fig. 6A)
and the results were quantified. In untreated MDA-MB-231 cells,

Fractions (1–10 ) were slot blotted to nitrocellulose and subsequently probed with antibodies to h1 integrin, flottilin (lipid raft resident protein), or Na+/K+-ATPase

46% of the j1 receptor protein is present in the lipid raft fractions.
Upon SKF10047 treatment, a 7-fold reduction (F = 62, P = 2.1 
10 3, n = 3) in the amount of j1 receptor protein present in the
lipid raft fractions was observed (Fig. 6B). Note that application of
2% methyl-h-cyclodextrin for 30 min to cells reduced the amount
of j1 receptor present in the lipid raft fractions by 7-fold
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Cholesterol levels were also quantified
from each fraction (Fig. 6C), and a reduction in the levels of lipid
raft cholesterol was noted upon SKF10047 application by 34%
(F = 18, P = 1.3  10 3, n = 3) or j1 receptor silencing by 50%
(F = 12, P = 1.6  10 3, n = 3). Total cellular cholesterol and total
cholesterol in all fractions was not significantly affected (data not
shown). We also used lipid raft staining to study the effect of
SKF10047 or j1 receptor silencing on lipid rafts. This labeling uses
a fluorescently labeled probe that binds to the pentasaccharide

www.aacrjournals.org

chain of plasma membrane ganglioside GM1, which selectively
partitions into lipid rafts. An antibody that recognizes the probe is
then used to cross-link the labeled lipid rafts into patches on the
plasma membrane. We observed a significant reduction in lipid
raft staining (Fig. 6D) upon SKF10047 treatment by 56% (F = 26,
P = 1.4  10 6, N = 500, n = 3) or j1 receptor silencing by 56%
(F = 70, P = 4.8  10 13, N = 500, n = 3).

Discussion
We have shown that the j1 receptor is capable of binding to
cholesterol through two CBD motifs [similar to the CBDs found in
the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (25) and the HIV Env
protein (26)]. Cholesterol docked to these CBDs as revealed by
molecular modeling in a position such that the polar hydroxyl group

is buried in the membrane with the steroid rings bound to the j1
receptor at the submembrane interface in a cleft/concavity. It is
likely that these CBDs in the COOH terminus of the j receptor form
part of the SKF10047 binding site because binding of the entire j1
receptor protein to cholesterol was inhibited by SKF10047 and
because one of the amino acids that seem to be essential for
cholesterol binding (Y173) is adjacent to one of the amino acid
residues (D172) found to be obligatory for ligand binding (11).
However, other amino acids (e.g., D126) have been found to be
obligatory for ligand binding (11) and SKF10047 only minimally
inhibited binding of the j receptor CBD peptides to cholesterol;
thus, we deduced that the CBDs partially form the binding site for
SKF10047 along with other amino acids (e.g., D126). Interestingly, a
study to investigate the interaction of the phenyl ring of cocaine
with the j1 receptor has identified D188 to be close to or in the
binding site (30). Our model for the j1 receptor is consistent with
this recent study, suggesting that this third hydrophobic region in
the j1 receptor is close to the j1 receptor ligand binding site. There
is evidence that certain steroid-like substances, such as progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA, can bind to j receptors (31) and it is
plausible that these neurosteroids can affect the ability of j
receptors to bind to cholesterol and hence affect lipid rafts. Our
experiments also explains why many drugs that bind to the j1
receptor such as haloperidol and ifenprodil also bind to the product
of the yeast gene ERG2, which encodes a sterol C8-C7 isomerase
(32). The existence of a lipophilic cholesterol-binding site in the j1
receptor explains the ability of the j1 receptor protein to bind so
many drugs from distinct pharmacologic classes because we
postulate that j drugs like sterol isomerase inhibitors mimic the
unstable carbocationic isomerization intermediate (33, 34).
In this study, we chose to study how j1 receptors may affect the
adhesion of cancer cells. j1 Receptor knockdown resulted in a
lowering of the levels of cholesterol in lipid rafts. Additionally,
SKF10047 ‘‘block’’ of the j1 receptor reduced levels of j1 receptor
localized to lipid rafts, indicating that the j1 receptor can
contribute to the cholesterol content of the lipid layers surrounding them and probably any associated molecules, for example,
integrins (in this study) or ion channels (6). Interestingly, Kv1.4 and
Kv1.5, two of the channels shown (6) to be a target of j1 receptors,
are also associated with cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and cholesterol
depletion dramatically alters the kinetic properties of Kv1.4 and
Kv1.5 (35, 36). Many of the pharmacologic effects of j receptor
drugs observed can be explained in terms of cholesterol alteration
of lipid rafts, for example, ion channel modulation (19), transporter
modulation (37), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation (38),
h1 integrin modulation (this article), and epidermal growth factor
modulation (21), because disruption of cholesterol in lipid rafts has
been shown to affect the signaling molecules that are present in
these rafts (39).
We have shown that j1 receptors are in a complex with h1
integrin in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and previously with

Kv1.4 channels in neurophysial terminals (6). We postulate that j1
receptors can form complexes with signaling molecules and that
the action of the j1 receptor may be to form or to stabilize lipid
rafts in the vicinity of these molecules by insertion of cholesterol.
Moreover, levels of the j1 receptor-h1 integrin complex in lipid raft
fractions were lowered upon SKF10047 application. The observed
effects of the j1 receptor drug SKF10047 on cancer cell adhesion
and Kv1.4 (6) can be interpreted only if we consider that this drug
acts to block the j1 receptor. Indeed, either application of
SKF10047 or transfection of j1 receptor RNAi had similar effects
in that they lowered the level of h1 integrin in the raft fractions,
which thus affected cellular adhesion. On the basis of adhesion,
results, and distribution of receptors in the raft and nonraft
sections, it should be stressed that breast cancer cell adhesion
inhibition require delocalization of j1 receptors and h1 integrin
outside lipid rafts to occur.
We can hypothesize that the physiologic function of j1 receptors
may be to bind and insert cholesterol into lipid membranes. This is
in agreement with the results of Hayashi and Su (23) who also
found j1 receptors in detergent-resistant microdomains but which
differed from those of classic, glycosphingolipid-containing lipid
rafts in that they possessed a higher buoyant density than classic
lipid rafts but retained high cholesterol content. Future experiments will thus focus on proving that the j1 receptor is capable of
directly inserting cholesterol into lipid membranes. It is interesting
to note that both j1 receptor and lipid raft levels are elevated in
cancer cells (7, 24). It is postulated that elevated cholesterol levels
lead to lipid raft coalescence, which might serve to sequester and
thus stimulate ‘‘on’’ signals to an oncogenic pathway (40). Notably,
cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane results in a
reduction in raft levels and leads to anoikis-like apoptosis, Bcl-xL
down-regulation, caspase-3 activation, and Akt inactivation of
various cancer cell types (24). This is remarkably similar to some of
the effects reported for j receptor drugs (16). It is very interesting
to find elevated levels of membrane cholesterol in prostate cancer
cell lines and breast cancer cell lines compared with their normal
counterparts, especially because j1 receptors and lipid raft levels
are elevated in cancer cells (7, 24) and SKF10047 treatment results
in a decrease in lipid raft cholesterol. Additionally, elevated levels of
cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in cancer cells are correlated with
apoptosis sensitivity induced by cholesterol-depleting agents (24);
we therefore suggest that j receptor drugs may be used as a
therapeutic treatment to lower lipid raft cholesterol in cancer cells,
thus inhibiting ‘‘on’’ signals to an oncogenic pathway (40) and
resulting in sensitivity to apoptotic drugs.
