ABSTRACT
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway activation contributes to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) pathogenesis
and drug resistance. Antitumor activity has been observed with mTOR inhibitors.
However, they have shown limited clinical efficacy in relation to drug activation of
feedback loops. Selective PI3K inhibition or dual PI3K/mTOR catalytic inhibition are
different therapeutic approaches developed to achieve effective pathway blockage.
Here, we have performed a comparative analysis of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus,
the pan-PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235
in primary MCL cells. We found NVP-BEZ235 to be more powerful than everolimus or
NVP-BKM120 in PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibition, indicating that targeting the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at multiple levels is likely to be a more effective strategy
for the treatment of MCL than single inhibition of these kinases. Among the three
drugs, NVP-BEZ235 induced the highest change in gene expression profile. Functional
validation demonstrated that NVP-BEZ235 inhibited angiogenesis, migration and
tumor invasiveness in MCL cells. NVP-BEZ235 was the only drug able to block IL4
and IL6/STAT3 signaling which compromise the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in
MCL. Our findings support the use of the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 as a
promising approach to interfere with the microenvironment-related processes in MCL.

INTRODUCTION

3-kinase (PI3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) is known to confer drug resistance to many
types of cancer, including MCL. This pathway integrates
signals from extracellular stimuli to regulate fundamental
cellular processes, including mRNA translation, cell
cycle progression and cell survival.[2] MCL tumors
frequently express the inactive phosphorylated form of
PTEN, a negative PI3K regulator, thereby contributing
to constitutive PI3K signaling.[3] In addition, gene
ampliﬁcation of PIK3CA (PI3K p110 catalytic subunit
alpha) has also been described in MCL.[4]
Selective targeting of PI3K has demonstrated the
potential to inhibit this pathway. However, the ﬁrst p110δ
isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib (GS-1101),

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive
B-lymphoid neoplasm with poor response to conventional
chemotherapy and short survival. It is genetically
characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)
(q13;q32), which dysregulates cyclin D1 expression.
Although cyclin D1 up-regulation is detected in nearly
all MCL, it is not sufficient for the development of the
disease. Additional chromosome alterations that target
genes involved in molecular pathways, such as cell cycle,
DNA damage response and cell survival, are frequently
found in MCL.[1]

with notable results in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma[5]
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia,[6] showed modest
responses in patients with MCL.[7] Moreover, it has been
postulated that the increased expression of PI3K p110α
isoform in MCL particularly at relapse might play a role
in MCL progression,[8] supporting the use of pan-PI3K
inhibitors. Currently, multiple PI3K inhibitors are under
clinical investigation.[9] Among them, NVP-BKM120
has shown efficacy both in vitro[10-13] and in vivo[14] in
several malignancies.
Allosteric mTOR inhibitors, which include
rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogues (temsirolimus,
everolimus and ridaforolimus), mainly target mTORC1
and also show single agent activity in a range of B-cell
malignancies.[15] Temsirolimus was approved by
the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of
relapsed and refractory MCL, while ridaforolimus and
everolimus have been entered in several clinical trials.
[16] However, mTORC1-specificity of rapamycin
analogues may limit its efficacy due to feedback
activation of upstream PI3K signaling, leading to Akt
hyperactivation.[17] In this sense, we previously reported
that activity of the oral mTOR inhibitor everolimus, is
limited by Akt rephosphorylation and that a selective
Akt inhibitor overcomes this compensatory reactivation.
[18] In this context, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors have
been synthesized, which, unlike rapamycin and its
analogues, are ATP competitive inhibitors and target
the catalytic site of both kinases.[9] These dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors have increased antitumor effects due
to their ability to suppress the prosurvival regulatory
feedback.[19] NVP-BEZ235 is an orally bioavailable
imidazoquinoline derivative that inhibits the kinase
activity of PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2.[20] It has
shown pre-clinical activity against a range of lymphoid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

malignancies[13;19;21-23] and is currently undergoing
phase I evaluation in acute leukemia (NCT01756118).
NVP-BEZ235 also exhibited antiproliferative effect
in MCL cell lines by downregulating Mcl-1[24] and
synergisms with conventional agents.[25;26]
In this study, we compared the therapeutic
potential of the novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235 to NVP-BKM120 (pan-class I PI3K inhibitor)
and everolimus (mTORC1 inhibitor) in primary MCL
samples. Our study supports the view that the concurrent
suppression of PI3K and mTORC2, in addition to
mTORC1, is likely to be a more effective strategy for the
treatment of MCL than single inhibition of these kinases.

RESULTS
Superior inhibitory activity of NVP-BEZ235
towards PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling compared to
everolimus and NVP-BKM120 in primary MCL
cells
Cells from 11 primary MCL cases were exposed
to everolimus (5 µM), NVP-BEZ235 (1 µM) or NVPBKM120 (1 µM) for 48 hours and cytotoxicity was
measured by Annexin V labeling (Table 1). Drug optimal
doses were selected based on previous studies.[10;18;24]
These doses showed a low cytotoxic effect in healthy B
and T lymphocytes (data not shown). Figure 1A the three
compounds induced significant cytotoxicity compared
to control (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). Among them,
NVP-BEZ235 induced a high cytotoxic effect with a mean
response of 40.80 ± 21.30 % which was significantly
higher than that observed with everolimus (mean response

of 22.74 ± 17.63 %; **, P < 0.01). The antitumor effect
of the pan-PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 reached 31.93 ±
17.31 %. The sensitivity to these drugs was not related to
genomic alterations of PI3K/Akt/mTOR (PTEN deletion,
PIK3CA and AKT1 amplifications) or TP53 alterations
(Table 1).
We then studied the ability of these drugs to
overcome stroma-mediated resistance. As expected,
coculture of primary MCL cells with the stromal cell line
HS-5 protected MCL cells from spontaneous apoptosis
after 48 hours of HS-5 coculture (**, P < 0.01; data not
shown). Of note, the three compounds were able to induce
apoptosis with the same efficiency despite the presence of
stromal cells, although only NVP-BEZ235 enhanced MCL
cell killing in HS-5 coculture (Figure 1B; *, P < 0.05).

We further evaluated the effect of these compounds
in the PI3K-mediated signaling. As expected, everolimus
blocked the activation of the mTOR downstream target
RPS6 but barely modified phospho-Akt levels, consistent
with the Akt rephosphorylation after exposure to
everolimus.[17;18] We also observed that NVP-BKM120
downregulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt and the
mTOR targets, RPS6 and EIF4E, while the dual inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235 demonstrated the greater inhibitory activity
toward PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, with a
complete reduction of the phosphorylation levels of Akt,
4EBP1, RPS6 and EIF4E (Figure 1C).
Thus, in MCL primary cells, dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibition is the best strategy to efficiently block PI3Kmediated signaling and to induce major apoptosis, even in

4EBP1 and EIF4E were determined by Western blot. Ratio between phosphorylated and total protein levels was calculated and relative
protein quantification in treated versus control extracts was conducted with Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). α-tubulin was probed as a
loading control. Two representative cases are shown (MCL nº.1 and nº.7). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ns, not significant.

gene expression pattern, as indicated by the independent
branch of the dendogram (Supplementary Figure A.1). We
then selected the genes specifically modulated by NVPBEZ235 that were not modified by the other inhibitors.
Figure 2B shows the heatmap of these 619 genes (281
genes upregulated and 338 genes downregulated) in a
representative primary MCL case.
As NVP-BEZ235 came out to be the compound
that induces more dramatic changes in GEP, we next
explored the biological networks involved in NVPBEZ235 treatment in MCL cells. As shown in Figure
2C, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with
a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a normalized
enrichment score (NES) < -1.7, we identified several
gene sets negatively enriched in NVP-BEZ235-treated
cells that were related to respiratory electron transport,
glucose metabolism, B-cell receptor signaling, cell cycle
and proliferation, all of them pathways well-known to be
affected by PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors.[2] In addition,
we also identified other pathways negatively enriched in
NVP-BEZ235-treated cells involved in hypoxia response,
angiogenesis, cell invasion, cytokines and inflammation,
such as NF-κB pathway, TOLL pathway, IL4 and IL6
signaling, and STAT3 pathway. Complete information of
the gene signatures is shown in Supplementary Table A.2.
Altogether, these findings suggest that improved
antitumor activity of NVP-BEZ235 in MCL is mostly

We next analyzed the impact of these PI3K/Akt/
mTOR inhibitors on gene expression profile (GEP) of
two representative MCL cases (MCL nº.1 and nº.2, Table
1) treated for 8 hours with the corresponding drugs. We
selected the common genes between the two MCL cases
that were differentially expressed from each treatment
compared to the control, with an absolute fold change
above 1.5. Everolimus treatment induced the lowest
number of gene modulations (118 genes upregulated
and 68 downregulated), whereas after NVP-BKM120
treatment 254 genes were upregulated and 290 genes were
downregulated. Interestingly, NVP-BEZ235 modulated
the highest number of genes, being 319 genes upregulated
and 399 downregulated (Figure 2A). Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering in each case showed that control
and everolimus-treated samples clustered together,
consistent with the low number of genes modified by the
drug. NVP-BKM120-treated samples clustered with the
previous control-everolimus group. Importantly, NVPBEZ235-treated samples showed the most different

in invasive and angiogenic processes in MCL. As tumor
invasiveness couples with the migratory ability of
cells, we first investigated the effect of these drugs on
actin polymerization and cell chemotaxis in response
to CXCL12. As shown in Figure 4A, CXCL12 induced
a notable increase in actin polymerization that was
significantly decreased only after NVP-BEZ235
incubation (*, P < 0.05). MCL cells were then assayed
for chemotaxis toward CXCL12. Figure 4B shows that
everolimus and NVP-BEZ235 significantly reduced the
number of migrating MCL cells in the presence of the
chemokine (59.80 ± 6.87 % of inhibition for everolimus,
66.87 ± 4.78 % of inhibition for NVP-BEZ235; *, P
< 0.05), whereas NVP-BKM120 had no significant
effect. We then examined the effect of these drugs on
MCL invasive properties with matrigel-coated invasion
chambers that simulate extracellular matrix. In response
to CXCL12, untreated MCL cells passed through matrigel,
however, NVP-BEZ235 significantly reduced CXCL12induced invasion (*, P < 0.05) whereas NVP-BKM120
and everolimus did not (Figure 4C).
Finally, we analyzed the effect of these drugs
on tumor angiogenesis with HUVEC tube formation
assay. Supernatants from MCL cells treated with NVPBEZ235 were significantly less angiogenic than those
from untreated MCL cells (*, P < 0.05), although MCL
cells exposed to everolimus or NVP-BKM120 showed a
tendency but not a significant decrease in the angiogenic
activity on HUVEC cells (Figure 5A).
All these results show that NVP-BEZ235 exerts a
significant reduction of migratory, invasive and angiogenic
properties of MCL cells.

NVP-BEZ235 blocks IL4 and IL6 signaling in
MCL cells
In order to validate the relevance of the GSEA gene
categories related to inflammation and cytokine signaling,
we selected a subset of the top leading edge genes for
further analysis in 10 primary MCL cells exposed to the
different drugs (Supplementary Table A.1). Several genes
related to the IL4, IL6 and STAT3 signatures, HCK (**, P
< 0.01), IL6 (*, P < 0.05), IRF1 (*, P < 0.05) and SP110
(**, P < 0.01) were validated as being downregulated only
by NVP-BEZ235 treatment. STAT1 was downregulated
by both everolimus (*, P < 0.05) and NVP-BEZ235
(**, P < 0.01), although NVP-BEZ235 effect was more
pronounced. Statistical significance was also achieved
with TLR4 (**, P < 0.01), from the TOLL pathway
signature (Figure 3A).
To further study the effect of NVP-BEZ235 in
interleukin signaling, primary MCL cells were exposed
to the corresponding drugs in the presence or absence of
IL4 or IL6 (Figure 3B). We observed that IL4 protected
MCL cells from spontaneous apoptosis (*, P < 0.05; data
not shown). Interestingly, while the cytotoxic effect of
everolimus and NVP-BKM120 was almost completely
reverted by IL4 (**, P < 0.01 for everolimus; *, P <
0.05 for NVP-BKM120), no alteration of NVP-BEZ235
citotoxicity was observed in the presence of IL4. It is
known that the activating phosphorylation of STAT
proteins can be triggered by cytokines such as IL4 and
IL6.[27] As shown in Figure 3C, incubation of primary
MCL cells with IL4 resulted in the phosphorylation of
downstream STAT6 and, in a minor degree, of STAT3.
Consistent with GEP data, NVP-BEZ235 was the only
drug able to block STAT6 and STAT3 phosphorylation
after IL4 stimulation, indicating that this compound is
interfering IL4 signaling in primary MCL cells. In the case
of IL6 stimulation, despite no differences in viability were
observed after treatment with the corresponding drugs
(Figure 3B), only NVP-BEZ235 was able to decrease the
phosphorylation levels of STAT3 induced by IL6 (Figure
3C).
These data demonstrate that only the dual inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235 is able to hamper IL4 and IL6 signaling in
MCL cells compared to everolimus or NVP-BKM120.

DISCUSSION
MCL is characterized by an unfavorable clinical
evolution being one of the most aggressive B-cell
lymphomas. Furthermore, current conventional therapies
are not able to control the long term evolution of the
disease and the tumors present frequent relapses. The
constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway, which is involved in the regulation of essential
cellular functions, is commonly observed in many tumors,
including MCL, and is critical for tumor progression and
resistance to antineoplastic drugs.[3;9]
Antitumor activity has been observed with mTOR
inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination. However,
only a portion of relapsed/refractory MCL patients respond
to the rapamycin analogues and the response is generally
not durable.[28-32] It has been reported that several
signaling feedback loops might attenuate the effectiveness
of these compounds,[17] so dual catalytic inhibition of
PI3K/mTOR could be a good strategy to address PI3K/
Akt/mTOR resistance mechanisms.
Here, we have compared the effect of everolimus,
an mTORC1 inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of

PI3K and mTOR (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and NVPBKM120, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, in primary MCL cells.
We observed that NVP-BEZ235 was more powerful
than everolimus or NVP-BKM120 in PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling inhibition and in cytotoxicity induction in the

presence of stromal cells. Accordingly, the ability of NVPBEZ235 to overcome microenvironment signals has been
previously reported in MCL cell lines.[25] Our results
confirmed for the first time this effect in primary MCL
cells. Thus, the use of the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
would support the idea that targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR
at multiple levels might be more efficient at inducing
apoptosis in the presence of microenvironment signals
and to prevent the development of drug resistance. This is
in agreement with a previous report of our group, where
we showed that dual mTORC1 and Akt targeting with
everolimus and an isoselective Akt inhibitor, respectively,
exerted synergistic antitumor activity in MCL.[18]
Based on the differences in drug-related cytotoxic
effect, GEP approach revealed that NVP-BEZ235
treatment was associated with the highest number of
modulated genes compared to NVP-BKM120 and
everolimus, being the MTORC1 inhibitor the drug that
induced the lowest number of gene changes. Consistently,

NVP-BEZ235-treated MCL samples downregulated wellknown pathways affected by PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors.
[2] In addition, we observed inhibition of pathways
involved in angiogenesis, cell invasion and inflammation
processes. Importantly, NVP-BEZ235 treatment
downregulated IL6 and IL4 cytokine signaling pathways
confirming an essential contribution of STAT family to the
PI3K/mTOR pathway[33] in MCL.
Interactions between the neoplastic B cells and
accessory cells in tissue microenvironments, such as the
lymphatic tissues, are critical for disease progression
and chemoresistance in various B-cell malignancies.
[34] In MCL, STAT3 activation has shown to be either
constitutively through a cytokine autocrine loop of IL6
and/or IL10 secretion or in response to B-cell receptor
engagement.[35] Moreover, IL6–mediated STAT3
activation has recently been found to compromise the
therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in MCL.[36] In this
context, we demonstrated that NVP-BEZ235 was able
to decrease STAT3 signaling in the presence of IL6, in
contrast to everolimus or NVP-BKM120. Besides, NVPBEZ235 also downregulated the gene expression levels
of HCK, IRF1, SP110 and STAT1, all genes related to the
IL6 signaling pathway. As human bone marrow stromal
cells have been described to secrete IL6,[37;38] we
hypothesize that NVP-BEZ235 increased cytotoxicity in
HS-5 coculture could be related to its ability to interfere
with cytokine signaling.
Growth-promoting activity of IL4 by means of
STAT6 phosphorylation has also been described in B-cell
lymphomas.[33;39-41] Interestingly, NVP-BEZ235
effectively overcame the prosurvival effect of IL4 as well
as completely inhibited IL4 signaling. In addition, TLR4
levels were also found to be downregulated by NVPBEZ235 treatment. A previous report described that the
activation of TLR4 signaling in MCL cells, one of the
predominant TLRs in these cells, induced proliferation
and secretion of cytokines like IL6 and VEGF.[42]
Recently, a whole-exome sequencing study detected
recurrent activating mutations in TLR2 that increased the
IL6 production among other chemokines.[43] Moreover,
NVP-BEZ235 was found to inhibit multiple paracrine and
autocrine survival growth factors in PI3K/Akt/mTORaddicted lymphomas.[19] Thus, our data support that
NVP-BEZ235 treatment may interfere with cytokine
signaling in MCL, which is crucial for keeping tumor
thriving in its microenvironment.
A key event in the development and progression of
cancer is the potential of tumor cells to migrate and invade
into surrounding tissues. In this context, we show for the
first time that NVP-BEZ235 clearly reduced the migratory
and invasive potential of MCL cells, as indicated in GEP
data. Recently, ibrutinib[44] and sorafenib[45] have been
described to inhibit migration of MCL cells, indicating
the potential of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors
in modulating the homing of MCL cells into lymphoid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tissues. Besides migratory and invasive processes,
angiogenesis appears to be of particular importance in the
physiopathology of lymphomas, as disease progression
was found to correlate with increased angiogenic activity.
[46] In this sense, involvement of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway in cell invasion and angiogenesis has been
proposed in follicular lymphoma.[47] Here, we provide
the first evidence of NVP-BEZ235 ability to interfere with
the angiogenic process. This effect could be related to the
observed downregulation of STAT3 signaling, as it was
demonstrated to participate in angiogenic responses in
vivo.[48]
MCL is one of the most difficult types of lymphoma
to treat, which is due in part to its frequent relapses and
progressive resistance to treatment suggesting that the
microenvironment may sustain residual tumor cells
resistant to chemotherapy.[1] Our findings suggest the use
of NVP-BEZ235 as a therapeutic strategy to interfere with
malignant cell/microenvironment interactions, thanks to its
involvement in essential processes such as angiogenesis,
migration, invasiveness and cytokine signaling. We
propose that targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at
multiple levels may therefore provide a more effective
antitumor activity than the current strategies using mTOR
inhibitors in MCL.

METHODS
Culture of primary and stromal cells
Primary cells from 11 patients diagnosed of MCL
were obtained. The ethical approvals for this project
including the informed consent of the patients were
granted following the guidelines of the Hospital Clínic

Significant gene signatures differentially regulated
by each drug versus untreated cells were identified with
GSEA version 2.0 (Broad Institute at MIT; http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/) using the C2 (curated gene sets)
collection from the Molecular Signature Database v2.5.
A two-class analysis with 1000 permutations of gene
sets and a weighted metric was used. Gene sets with a
false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.05 were considered
significant.

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)

Whole protein extraction and Western blot analysis
were done as previously described.[18] Membranes were
probed with the following primary antibodies from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers): phospho-Akt (Ser473),
phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6; Ser235/236),
phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46), phospho-eIF4E (Ser209),
phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705, clone D3A7), phospho-STAT6
(Tyr641), Akt, RPS6, 4EBP1, eIF4E, STAT3 (clone
79D7) and STAT6 (clone D3H4). Horseradish peroxidaselabeled anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and anti-rabbit IgG (Cell
Signaling Technology) were used as secondary antibodies.
Ratio between phosphorylated and total protein levels was
calculated and relative protein quantification in treated
versus control extracts was conducted with Image Gauge
software (Fujifilm). Equal protein loading was confirmed
by re-probing membranes with anti-β-actin or anti-αtubulin antibodies (Sigma).

mRNA quantification by real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol method
(Life technologies) as above. In order to eliminate any
traces of DNA, RNA was incubated with the DNA-free
kit (Life Technologies). DNA-free RNA (0.5-1 μg) was
retrotranscribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies). Then,
samples were processed to Specific Target Amplification
using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix and the TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays (Life Technologies) for a
multiplexed preamplification of the targets of interest
(Supplementary Table A.1). Finally, samples were diluted
1/5 in Tris-EDTA buffer and 48.48 Dynamic Array –
Gene Expression IFC (Fluidigm Corporation) was run as
recommended by the manufacturer, with the same TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays as before. The relative expression
of each gene was quantified by the comparative cycle
threshold (Ct) method (ΔΔCt) using GUSB as endogenous
control. mRNA expression levels are given in arbitrary
units, taking as a reference the untreated control sample.

Gene expression profiling (GEP)
Total RNA was isolated from primary MCL cells,
previously exposed to 5 µM everolimus, 1 µM NVPBEZ235 or 1 µM NVP-BKM120 for 8 hours, using
the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was examined
with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies)
and 150 ng of high quality RNA were used to generate
biotin-labeled cRNA. After cRNA fragmentation,
samples were hybridized on the HT HG-U219 GeneChip
perfect-match-only array plate (Affymetrix) following
standardized protocols. Scanning was processed in
the Gene Titan instrument (Affymetrix) and analyzed
with GeneChip Command Console Software (AGCC)
(Affymetrix). Raw data were normalized using the Robust
Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm implemented in the
Expression Console Software v1.1 (Affymetrix). Raw data
have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
Database (accession number GSE53309).
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 10000
high-standard deviation genes was performed using
Pearson’s correlation coefficient and average linkage,
as the similarity measure and clustering algorithm
respectively, within TM4-MultiExperiment Viewer
platform. Genes modulated by a specific treatment were
displayed with Cluster (version 2.11) and TreeView

Chemotaxis and actin polymerization assays
CXCL12-induced
chemotaxis
and
actin
polymerization assays were performed as previously
described.[10] Migration is represented as the relative
number of migrating cells, taking as a reference the
untreated control without CXCL12. As for actin
polymerization assays, results are plotted relative to the
mean fluorescence of the sample before the addition of
CXCL12.

Cell invasion assay
Primary MCL cells were serum-starved for 1.5
hours in FBS-free RPMI 1640 (107 cells/mL). Next, cells
6796

were diluted (5x106 cells/mL with 0.5 % BSA in RPMI
1640), incubated with the corresponding drugs for 1 hour
and afterwards, 100 µL were added to the top chambers of
rehydrated BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (Becton
Dickinson). Chambers had been previously transferred to
wells containing 600 μL of 0.5 % BSA in RPMI 1640 with
200 ng/mL of CXCL12. Input cell count was obtained
from adding 100 μL of cell suspension to wells containing
600 μL of 0.5 % BSA in RPMI 1640. After 24 hours of
incubation, 100 μL were collected in triplicate from each
lower chamber and input well, viable cells gated in a
FSC/SSC plot and counted on an Attune cytometer under
constant flow rate. Invasion is represented as the ratio
between invasive cells and input viable cells, relative to
the untreated control.

HUVEC tube formation assay

AUTHORSHIP AND DISCLOSURES

HUVEC cells, kindly provided by Dr MC Cid
(IDIBAPS), were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 20 % defined bovine calf serum (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 0.2 mg/mL endothelial cell growth supplement
(Becton Dickinson), 5 units/mL sodium heparin (EMD
Millipore), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillinstreptomycin, 50 μg/mL gentamycin (Life Technologies)
and 2.5 μg/mL fungizone (Sigma). Supernatant from
primary MCL cells (2x106 cells/mL) was collected after
8 hours of incubation with drugs. Twenty-four-well plates
were coated with 300 μL of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson)
and allowed to polymerize for 30 minutes at 37ºC.
Subsequently, 500 μL of the supernatant of interest and
500 μL of HUVEC cells (0.8x105 cells/mL) in its medium
were added into each culture well. After 24 hours of
incubation, the number of branch points was quantified
as the mean of 5 randomly chosen fields from each well.
Images were taken at x40 magnification in a DM IL LED
microscope coupled to a DFC295 camera with Leica
Application Suite v 3.7 software (Leica).
