Abstract
SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene) was first identified as a
stress-responsive protein that, when overexpressed, inhibited
apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. SAG was later found to be
the second family member of ROC1 or Rbx1, a RING
component of SCF and DCX E3 ubiquitin ligases. We report
here that SAG/ROC2/Rbx2 is a novel transcriptional target
of activator protein-1 (AP-1). AP-1 bound both in vitro and
in vivo to two consensus binding sites in a 1.3-kb region of
the mouse SAG promoter. The SAG promoter activity, as measured by luciferase reporter assay, was dependent on these
sites. Consistently, endogenous SAG is induced by 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) with an induction time
course following the c-Jun induction in both mouse epidermal
JB6-Cl.41 and human 293 cells. TPA-mediated SAG induction
was significantly reduced in JB6-Cl.41 cells overexpressing a
dominant-negative c-Jun, indicating a requirement of c-Jun/
AP-1. On the other hand, SAG seemed to modulate the c-Jun
levels. When overexpressed, SAG remarkably reduced both
basal and TPA-induced c-Jun levels, whereas SAG small
interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing increased substantially the
levels of both basal and TPA-induced c-Jun. Consistently, SAG
siRNA silencing reduced c-Jun polyubiquitination and blocked
c-Jun degradation induced by Fbw7, an F-box protein of SCF
E3 ubiquitin ligase. Finally, SAG overexpression inhibited,
whereas SAG siRNA silencing enhanced, respectively, the TPAinduced neoplastic transformation in JB6-Cl.41 preneoplastic
model. Thus, AP-1/SAG establishes an autofeedback loop, in
which on induction by AP-1, SAG promotes c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation, thus inhibiting tumor-promoting
activity of AP-1. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3616–25]

Introduction
Activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is a dimer
consisting of 18 different combinations of Jun-Jun or Jun-Fos
proteins. The Jun family of proteins includes c-Jun, JunB, and JunD,
whereas the Fos family of proteins includes c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and
Fra-2 (1). The c-jun and c-fos genes are inducible by a broad range
of extracellular stimuli. On activation, AP-1 binds to 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements or AP-1
binding sites, 5¶-TGAG/CTCA-3¶, to transactivate many effector
genes, thus regulating cell proliferation, tumor promotion, cell

cycle, growth arrest, and apoptosis (1–3). The analysis of cells and
mice deficient in individual AP-1 proteins has identified several
physiologically relevant AP-1 target genes, including cyclin D1, p16,
p19, p53, p21, and Fas ligand (1). Activation of cyclin D1 and
inhibition of p53 and p21 would promote cell cycle progression
from G1 to S to induce cell proliferation.
AP-1 was first considered as a mediator of tumor promotion by
its ability to alter gene expression in response to tumor promoters,
such as TPA and UV irradiation (3). Indeed, TPA, UV, as well as
reactive oxygen species activate AP-1 (4–6). In mouse epidermal
JB6 cell variants, representing from early to late stages of tumor
promotion, the AP-1 activity is progressively elevated (7). On the
other hand, cell growth and neoplastic transformation was significantly impaired on blockage of AP-1 activity by either pharmacologic inhibitors, such as glucocorticoid, retinoic acid, or
molecular biological inhibitors, including dominant-negative c-Jun
(TAM67), dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (p85),
and dominant-negative extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2
(Erk2; refs. 8–13). Moreover, acquisition of a tumor promotionresistant phenotype is associated with a loss of responsiveness
to tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation (14), whereas rescuing
such a response by introducing wild-type (WT) Erk2 converts tumor
promotion-resistant phenotype to tumor promotion-sensitive phenotype (15).
SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene) was initially cloned by
differential display as a redox-inducible gene that encodes an
evolutionarily conserved RING finger protein (16, 17). Further
characterization of SAG revealed that SAG is a dual-function
protein with antioxidant activity when acting alone or E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity when complexed with other ligase components
(17, 18). Recently, ROC1/Rbx1/Hrt1, a family member of SAG and a
component of SCF (Skp1, cullin1, and F-box protein) and DCX
(DDB1, cullin 4A, and X-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases was
implicated in ubiquitination and degradation of c-Jun (19–23).
However, it has not been shown previously that SAG, through
binding to Cul-1 and Cul-4A (20), will replace ROC1/Rbx1 to form
a SAG-SCF E3 ligase and promote c-Jun degradation. We report
here that SAG is induced by TPA via AP-1–mediated transactivation. On the other hand, AP-1 component, c-Jun, is a SAG
substrate. When overexpressed, SAG remarkably reduced both
basal and TPA-induced c-Jun levels, whereas SAG small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing significantly increased the levels of
both endogenous and TPA-induced c-Jun. SAG silencing inhibited
c-Jun polyubiquitination and blocked Fbw7-induced c-Jun degradation. Finally, SAG overexpression within physiologic levels
inhibited, whereas SAG silencing enhanced, the TPA-induced
neoplastic transformation in JB6-Cl.41 cells. Thus, it seems that
c-Jun-SAG constitutes a negative feedback loop as a cellular
defensive mechanism to minimize the prolonged effect of AP-1
activation.

SAG and c-Jun, an Autofeedback Loop

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human HeLa, 293, and H1299 cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mouse JB6-Cl.41 cells were
cultured in DMEM containing 5% FBS. JB6-Cl.41 cells expressing TAM67
(24) were cultured in 5% DMEM containing G418 (400 Ag/mL).
Promoter cloning, luciferase reporter construction, and luciferase
activity assay. A 1.3-kb fragment upstream of mouse SAG translational
initiation site was cloned by PCR with primers mSAG-P01 (5¶-GGGGTACCAGCCTTGGTTGCCCGAAAC-3¶) and mSAG-P02 (5¶-CCGCTCGAGGGCGGCGGCGCAGAACGG-3¶). The fragment was then gel purified and subcloned
into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter (Promega, Madison, WI) at the KpnI/XhoI
or KpnI/HindIII site with subsequent sequencing confirmation as described
(25). The luciferase reporter was designated as mSAG-P1.3 or 7AP ( for
containing seven putative AP-1 binding sites). This construct was used as the
template to generate a series of deletion or site-directed mutants, including
5AP (containing five AP-1 sites) with the primer set of AP1-3-KpnI (5¶GGTACCGAGGGATGACTCAGTGGT-3¶) and mSAG-P02; 4AP (containing
four AP-1 sites) with primer set of D3 (5¶-GGTACCGTGGTTAAAACCATGGTCTG-3¶) and mSAG-P02; 2AP (containing two AP-1 sites) with the
primer set of AP1-6-KpnI (5¶-GGTACCCCTCGTGACGTCACTGGC-3¶) and
mSAG-P02; 1AP (containing one AP-1 site) with the primer set of AP1-7-KpnI
(5¶-GGTACCGCGCCATCCAATCATCGC-3¶) and mSAG-P02; and 0AP (with all
AP-1 sites deleted) with the primer set of D5 (5¶-GGTACCTCGCCGTCTGGCTCCGCCCG-3¶) and mSAG-P02. A T!A substitution at AP1-3 and AP1-6
primers was introduced to generate Mu-5AP and Mu-2AP constructs with
AP-1 binding site abolished. To generate the 1.3-kb promoter construct with
AP-1 sites 3 and 6 mutated (Mu-3,6), the QuickChange Multi Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used, following the
manufacturer’s instruction. The sequence of the primers used is Sag-AP1mu3-01 (5¶-TGTAGTGTCTGGAGGGAAGACTCAGTGGTTAAAAC-3¶) and
Sag-AP1-mu6-01 (5¶-CCCAGCCCCTCGAGACGTCACTGGC-3¶). To measure
the promoter activity of the mSAG-P1.3 and its deletion or site-directed
mutants, HeLa cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 18,000 cells
per well. Cells were transiently cotransfected, using TR01 transfection
reagent (America Pharma Source, Gaithersburg, MD), with these luciferase
reporters individually, along with a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase
(Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Forty hours posttransfection, cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase activity assay, using
the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) on a LD400 Luminescence
detector (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) as described (26). The results from
three independent experiments with each run in duplicate or triplicate were
expressed as fold induction after normalization with transfection efficiency
and by arbitrarily setting the value of pGL3-Basic vector control as 1.
Identification of the transcription initiation site. To define the
transcription initiation site of the mouse SAG, a PCR-based 5¶-rapid
amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done using the First-choice RLMRACE kit with protocols suggested by the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin,
TX) as described previously (26). Briefly, total mouse RNA was treated with
calf intestine alkaline phosphatase to remove free 5¶-phosphates from
molecules of fragmented mRNA. The RNA was then treated with tobacco
acid pyrophosphatase to remove the cap structure from full-length mRNA,
leaving a 5¶-monophosphate. A 5¶-RACE adapter oligonucleotides, 5¶-GCUGAUGGCGAUGAAUGAACACUGCGUUUGCUGGCUUUGAUGAAA-3¶, which
is specific for the 5¶-monophosphate, was ligated to the RNA population
using T4 RNA ligase. A reverse transcription was done using random
decamers, and the nest PCR then amplified the 5¶-end of the mouse SAG
mRNA using the 5¶-RACE outer primer, 5¶-GCTGATGGCGATGAATGAACACTG-3¶, or 5¶-RACE inner primer, 5¶-CGCGGATCCGAACACTGCGTTTGCTGGCTTTGATG-3¶ and a primer from the SAG mRNA, 5¶-CAACACAGTCCTCTTGCTTGT-3¶. The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TA
cloning vectors and insert fragments were sequenced. The transcription
initiation site was determined by comparing the sequences immediately
after the 5¶-RACE adapter oligonucleotide to the mouse SAG gene sequence.
Gel retardation assay. Seven oligonucleotides and their corresponding complementary strands were synthesized (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
as follows with the putative AP-1 binding sites in italics: Sag-AP1-1

(5¶-GAAACTTGATTTGTAGACCA-3¶), Sag-AP1-2 (5¶-GCCTTATAACTCACAAGGAT-3¶), Sag-AP1-3 (5¶-GAGGGATGACTCAGTGGTTA-3¶), Sag-AP1-3-MU
(5¶-GAGGGAAGACTCAGTGGTTA-3¶), Sag-AP1-4 (5¶-TTTGTTTGTTTGCTTGCTTGC-3¶), Sag-AP1-5 (5¶-AAGGTGTGAGCTACCACGCC-3¶), Sag-AP1-6 (5¶CCTCGTGACGTCA CTGGCGC-3¶), Sag-AP1-6-Mu (5¶-CCTCGAGACGTCACTGGCGC-3¶), and Sag-AP1-7 (5¶-GCGCCATCCAATCATCGCCGT-3¶). The
paired oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with 32P using T4
polynucleotide kinase and [g-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared from
JB6-Cl.41 cells treated with TPA (20 ng/mL) for 16 h and subjected to gel
retardation assay as described (27). In some experiments, the c-Jun antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 50 excess of cold specific or
nonspecific oligonucleotide was included to determine the binding specificity.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. JB6-Cl.41 cells were left
untreated or treated with TPA (20 ng/mL) for 12 h before being subjected
to chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) analysis, according to the
protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) as described
(26, 28). Input samples (one tenth of original DNA lysates) or samples
precipitated with no antibody (Ab) or IgG for negative controls or c-Jun
antibody (c-Jun) were PCR amplified. The primer sequences for the third
AP-1 binding site (WT3) are mSAG-p-ChIP-3-01, 5¶-GTTCTTGCCCTTCTGCTTACC-3¶, and mSAG-p-ChIP-3-02, 5¶-TGCTGTGAGGTGTCAGATTC-3¶,
to generate a 215-bp fragment. The primer sequences for the sixth AP-1
binding site are mSAG-p-ChIP-6-01, 5¶-TGTAACTCCAGACAATGCTC-3¶,
and mSAG-p-ChIP-6-02, 5¶-AGCCAGACGGCGATGATTGG-3¶, to generate a
115-bp fragment.
Northern and Western blotting analyses. The cells were treated with
TPA (20 ng/mL) for various periods up to 24 h and subjected to Northern
analysis as described previously (29). For Western blotting analysis, cells
were lysed in a Triton X-100 lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/L EGTA, and 5 mmol/L EDTA]
with freshly added protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for
30 min on ice followed by centrifugation for 30 min. Supernatants were
measured for protein concentration using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and subjected to Western blotting (17) using
antibodies against c-Jun, c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SAG, or ROC1/
Rbx1. The h-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used as a loading control.
Lentivirus-based SAG overexpression in mouse JB6-Cl.41 cells. A
lentivirus-based SAG-overexpressing construct (FG9-HA-SAG) was generated using lentivirus vector, FG9-EF1a (kindly provided by Dr. Colin Duckett,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Following DNA sequencing
confirmation, the HA-tagged SAG construct, along with the empty vector
control, was transiently cotransfected into 293 cells with plasmids
expressing gag, env, and polymerase. Virus-containing supernatants
were collected and used to infect mouse JB6-Cl.41 cells. Expression of both
HA-SAG and endogenous SAG was determined by Western blotting using
anti-SAG antibody.
siRNA silencing. A lentivirus-based siRNA construct (H1, kindly
provided by Dr. Ihor Lemischka, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) was
used to make an LT-SAG-siRNA. The sequences of SAG siRNA oligonucleotide are LT-bSAG01 (5¶-AACAAGAGGACTGTGTTGTGGTCTGGTTCAAGAGACCAGACCACAACACAGTCCTCTTGTTTTTTGT-3¶) and LT-bSAG-02
(5¶-CTAGACAAAAAACAAGAGGACTGTGTTGTGGTCTGGTCTCTTGAACCAGACCACAACACAGTCCTCTTGTT-3¶). The control siRNA sequences are
LT-Control-01 (5¶-ATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTTTCAAGAGAAAGTCTGCGATCGCATACAATTTTTTGT-3¶) and LT-Control-02 (5¶-CTAGACAAAAAATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTTCTCTTGAAAAGTCTGCGATCGCATACAAT-3¶). The LT-SAG-siRNA plasmid, along with the control LT-ContsiRNA, was confirmed by DNA sequence and then cotransfected into 293
cells, along with gag- and env-expressing plasmids. The supernatants
containing viable LT-SAG-siRNA virus or LT-Cont virus were collected and
used to infect JB6-Cl.41 cells.
To silence human SAG or ROC1/Rbx1 in 293 cells, a plasmid-based
hairpin RNAs were made using the pU6pro vector (kindly provided by Dr.
David L. Turner, University of Michigan; ref. 30) as described.1 The siRNA

template oligonucleotides were made by Invitrogen. For psiSAG, the primer
sequences are iSAG2-1 (5¶-TTTGAACAAGAGGACTGTGTTGTGGTCTGGGCAAGAGCCAGACCACAACACAGCCTGTTTTT-3¶) and iSAG2-2 (5¶-CTAG AAAAACAAGAGGACTGTGTTGTGGTCTGGCCTCCAGACCACAACAACAGTCCTCTTGTT-3¶). For psi-hROC1, the primer sequences are iROC1-1
(5¶-TTTG AAGACTTCTTCCATCAAGCTTCAAGAGAAGCTTGATGGAAAGAAGCTTTT-3¶) and iROC1-2 (5¶-CTAG AAAAAGACTTCTTCCATTCAAGCTTCTCTTGAAGCTATGAAAAGTCTT-3¶). The control psiCont
sequences are iCont01 (5¶-TTTGATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTCAAGAAGAAGTCTGCGATCGCATACAATTTTT-3¶) and iCont02 (5¶-CTAGAAAAATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTCTCTTGAAGTCTGCGATCGCATAACAAT-3¶). The cohesive ends of restriction enzymes BbsI (TTTG) and XbaI
(CTAG) are in italics. The annealed synthetic primers were ligated into
pU6pro vector predigested with BbsI and XbaI. The recombinant psiSAG
plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To determine the effect of
siRNA silencing of SAG or ROC1/Rbx1 on Fbw7-mediated c-Jun degradation, the 293 cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids expressing
ubiquitin and c-Jun with or without Fbw7 in the absence or presence of psihSAG or psi-hROC1. Thirty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were
harvested and lysed. The cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to
Western blotting using various antibodies.
In vivo ubiquitination. Human lung H1299 cells were transiently
transfected with His-Ub and c-Jun alone or in combination with psiSAG or
psiCont. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and split into two
aliquots with one for direct Western blotting analysis and the other for
in vivo ubiquitination assay as described (31). Briefly, cell pellets were lysed
in buffer A [6 mol/L guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/L h-mecaptoethanol] and incubated
with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at room temperature for 4 h.
Beads were washed once with each of buffer A, buffer B [8 mol/L urea,
0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/L
h-mecaptoethanol], and buffer C [8 mol/L urea, 0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4/
NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.3), 10 mmol/L h-mecaptoethanol].
Proteins were eluted from beads with buffer D [200 mmol/L imidazole,
0.15 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 30% glycerol, 0.72 mol/L h-mecaptoethanol,
5% SDS]. The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting for
polyubiquitination of c-Jun with anti–c-Jun antibody.
Soft agar assay. A standard soft agar assay was done as detailed
previously (32). Briefly, 10,000 of parental JB6-Cl.41 P+ cells or its Lenti-SAG
transfectants (either SAG overexpressed or SAG silenced), along with the
vector controls, were suspended in 0.33% agar containing 10% FCS in a 60mm dish either in the absence (DMSO) or the presence of TPA (20 ng/mL).
After grown in 37jC for 14 days, the cells were stained with piodonitrotetrazolium (1 mg/mL; Sigma) for overnight and the colonies
with cell numbers more than eight were counted in five randomly selected
areas from each dish. The results were from three independent assays, each
run in duplicate. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA and
Student’s t test.

Results
Molecular cloning and characterization of mouse SAG
promoter. We have shown previously that SAG is inducible at
the transcriptional level under redox-stress and hypoxic conditions
(17, 33, 34). To determine the nature of SAG induction under
various stress conditions, we went on and cloned a 1.3-kb genomic
sequence upstream from the translational initiation site of mouse
SAG gene (accession no. NT_039476). Bioinformatics analysis,
using Transfac2 software, of this potential SAG promoter fragment
revealed the consensus binding sites for many transcription factors
including AP-1, nuclear factor-nB, p53, and hypoxia-inducible
factor-1, among others. In this study, we characterized the
regulation of the SAG promoter by AP-1. In this 1.3-kb potential

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

SAG promoter fragment, there are seven putative AP-1 binding
sites (Genbank accession no. DQ231571). Some are exactly
matching the typical AP-1 consensus site 5¶-TGAG/CTCA-3¶,
whereas others are its derivatives identified by Transfac software
as the potential AP-1 binding sites (data not shown). Before a
detailed characterization of the SAG promoter, we first defined the
transcription initiation site of the mouse SAG gene by the 5¶-RACE
experiment. DNA sequencing of several independent 5¶-RACE
clones all showed an adenine at 31 position upstream the
translational initiation site at the very 5¶-end of SAG transcript
before reaching the adaptor sequence, indicating that it is the
transcription initiation site.
AP-1 binds both in vitro and in vivo to the consensus
binding sites in the promoter of mouse SAG gene. We next
determined whether AP-1 directly binds to these putative
consensus sites first in vitro by a gel retardation assay. Nuclear
extracts were prepared from JB6-Cl.41 cells treated with TPA and
incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides, each containing a
putative AP-1 binding site. Initial binding assay revealed that AP-1
only bound to two consensus sites, site 3 (TGACTCA) and site 6
(TGACGTCA) significantly, but not to other five putative sites (data
not shown). To determine the binding specificity, these two sites
were mutated by a single T!A substitution ( for site 3, AGACTCA;
for site 6, AGACGTCA). These mutant oligonucleotides, along
with their WT controls, were subjected to gel retardation assay as
shown in Fig. 1A. AP-1 bound significantly to the sites 3 (Fig. 1A,
WT3, lane 1) and 6 (Fig. 1A, WT6, lane 7). These AP-1 bindings can
be supershifted by an anti–c-Jun antibody (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 8),
blocked by a specific cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 9),
but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 10).
A single T!A point mutation completely abolished the AP-1
binding in both sites (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 11 and 12).
Thus, AP-1 specifically bound to two AP-1 sites in the mouse SAG
promoter.
We further confirmed these AP-1 direct bindings using an in vivo
ChIP. JB6-Cl.41 cells were left untreated or treated with TPA for
12 h to activate AP-1 and then subjected to ChIP analysis. As shown
in Fig. 1B (top), a 215-bp PCR-amplified fragment, corresponding
to the third AP-1 binding site (WT3), was detected in the input
sample (Fig. 1B, top, lane 1) or in the samples immunoprecipitated
with c-Jun antibody (Fig. 1B, top, lane 4) but not in two control
samples either without antibody added (Fig. 1B, top, lane 2) or
with IgG added (Fig. 1B, top, lane 3) for immunoprecipitation.
This specific AP-1 binding was enhanced after TPA treatment
(Fig. 1B, top, compare lanes 4 versus 8). Similarly, AP-1 bound to
the sixth binding site (WT6), revealed as a 156-bp fragment in the
input or in c-Jun antibody, immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 1B,
bottom, lanes 1 and 4) but not in other controls (Fig. 1B, bottom,
lanes 2 and 3). The binding was again enhanced by TPA treatment
(Fig. 1B, bottom). Thus, we conclude from these results that AP-1
indeed directly binds to two AP-1 consensus sequences in the
promoter of the mouse SAG gene.
AP-1 binding site-dependent transactivation of mouse SAG
promoter. We next determined the promoter activity of this 1.3-kb
mouse SAG upstream fragment and its dependence of AP-1 binding
sites. The luciferase reporters driven by the 1.3-kb fragment (7AP)
and its series of mutants with AP-1 site either deleted or mutated
were constructed and tested in a luciferase reporter assay. As
shown in Fig. 1C, the construct (7AP) driven by this 1.3-kb fragment caused a 550-fold higher luciferase activity compared with
the empty vector, indicating that this 1.3-kb fragment has a strong

to ChIP analysis. Input samples or
samples precipitated with no antibody
(Ab), IgG, or c-Jun antibody (c-Jun)
were PCR amplified using primers specific
for the third AP-1 binding site (WT3, top )
or the sixth AP-1 binding site (WT6,

site-dependent transactivation of the
mouse SAG promoter. Left, representation
of a series of luciferase reporters driven by
various deletion or mutation mutants of
mouse SAG promoter with putative AP-1
binding site boxed in black; right, the
luciferase activity of each construct. HeLa
cells were plated in 96-well plates and
transiently cotransfected with luciferase
reporters driven by the 1.3-kb SAG
promoter fragment and its series of
deletion or mutation mutants, along with
the pGL-3–negative control, respectively.
Renilla-luc reporter was included for
normalization of transfection efficiency.
Forty hours post-transfection, cells were
lysed and subjected to luciferase activity
assay. Luciferase activity was presented
as fold activation from three independent
transfections, each run in duplicate or
triplicate after normalization of transfection
efficiency by arbitrarily setting the value
of pGL-3 as 1.

promoter activity. Deletion of 467 base nucleotides from the 5¶-end
(construct 5AP) caused a 1.6-fold reduction of the luciferase
activity. Because this deleted fragment contained two putative AP-1
sites to which AP-1 failed to bind, it is likely that the cis-elements
for other transcription factors rather than AP-1 contributed to this
portion of the promoter activity. The deletion or mutation of the
AP1-3 site (construct 4AP or Mu-5AP, respectively), which showed a
strong AP-1 binding, caused an additional 1.4-fold reduction of the
promoter activity, indicating that this AP-1 binding site alone
contributed significantly to the promoter activity. Further deletion
of 629 base nucleotides (construct 2AP), including two putative
AP-1 sites to which AP-1 failed to bind, did not cause any change in
luciferase activity, indicating that this fragment has no promoter
activity. Further deletion or mutation of a strong AP-1 binding site
6 (construct 1AP or Mu-2AP, respectively) resulted in a 1.6-fold
reduction of the promoter activity, indicating its strong contribution to the promoter activity. Moreover, the deletion of AP-1
binding site 7 (construct 0AP) caused an additional 1.4-fold
reduction of the promoter activity, suggesting the contribution
from other transcription factors. Finally, we directly compared the
luciferase activity between two reporter constructs driven either by

www.aacrjournals.org

the 1.3-kb mouse SAG promoter (7AP) or by its mutant with a
single mutation at both AP-1 binding sites 3 and 6 (Mu-3,6), which
abolished the AP-1 binding. As shown in Fig. 1D, the mutations at
these two AP-1 binding sites reduced the overall luciferase activity
by 3.4-fold. Taken together, the results clearly showed that the
promoter activity of mouse SAG gene is significantly dependent
on two true AP-1 binding sites and strongly suggested an AP-1–
dependent activation of the SAG promoter.
SAG induction by TPA. We next determined whether
endogenous SAG mRNA and protein are subjected to induction
by TPA, a typical tumor promoter and AP-1 activator. Mouse
epidermal JB6-Cl.41 cells were treated with TPA (20 ng/mL) for
various times and subjected to Northern analysis. As shown in
Fig. 2A, SAG mRNA was detectable in JB6-Cl.41 cells and started to
increase 1 h post-TPA treatment and reached a peak induction of
3.8-fold at 4 h. Increased mRNA started to decrease thereafter and
returned toward the background level by 24 h. These results further
indicated that SAG induction by TPA occurred at the transcriptional level. We next determined the SAG induction by TPA at the
protein level. Cell lysates were prepared after TPA treatment for
various periods and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-SAG

antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, similar to the pattern of SAG mRNA
induction, the SAG protein levels started to increase at 1 h after
treatment and reached a peak induction of up to 2.5-fold at 4 to 8 h.
The induced SAG level then gradually reduced to the untreated
control level at 24 h post-TPA treatment. We next determined the
time course of c-Jun induction by TPA in this cell model. If SAG is a
true target of c-Jun/AP-1, the time course of SAG induction should
follow that of c-Jun induction. Indeed, the c-Jun levels increased
30 min after TPA exposure and continued to increase and reached
a peak induction of 5-fold from 2 to 8 h. The induced levels started
to decrease at 16 and 24 h (Fig. 2B). The results clearly showed that

the time course of SAG induction by TPA closely followed that of
c-Jun induction.
To determine whether TPA-induced SAG induction requires
c-Jun/AP-1, we used the JB6-Cl.41 cells overexpressing TAM67, a
dominant-negative c-Jun that has been shown previously to block
AP-1 activity in multiple cell models, including JB6-Cl.41 cells
(24, 35–38). As shown in Fig. 2C, in vector-transfected control cells,
TPA caused a gradual increase of SAG level with a peak induction
of 3- to 3.5-fold at 4 to 8 h post-treatment. In contrast, TPA only
slightly induced SAG expression up to 1.5-fold at 2 to 4 h post-TPA
exposure in TAM67-transfected cells. Thus, the magnitude of TPAinduced SAG induction was significantly reduced when the AP-1
activity is blocked, indicating that SAG induction by TPA is largely
AP-1 dependent. Finally, we extended our observation in JB6-Cl.41
cells that SAG is inducible by TPA to human 293 cells. As shown
in Fig. 2D, the SAG level started to increase for f2-fold at 2 to
4 h post-TPA exposure and reached the peak of a 3-fold increase
at 16 h. The c-Jun expression at the basal level was hardly detectable in 293 cells but was rapidly induced by TPA, starting at 30 min
for f2-fold increase and reaching the peak of a 13-fold increase at
16 h. Again, the time course of SAG induction seemed to follow
that of c-Jun induction. Taken together, the data from assays of
gel retardation, luciferase-based transactivation, and endogenous
induction in both mouse and human cell lines all suggested that
SAG is inducible by TPA through AP-1 binding and transactivation
and SAG is a novel AP-1 target gene.
SAG overexpression reduces both basal and TPA-induced
c-Jun levels in JB6-Cl.41 cells. Few recent studies have shown that
c-Jun is subjected to ubiquitination and degradation by SCF and
DCX E3 ubiquitin ligases (22, 23). Because SAG is a RING component of SCF E3 ligase, we wondered whether SAG is involved in
and if so, SAG would inhibit c-Jun levels on overexpression. We
tested this hypothesis by using a lentivirus-based SAG construct
expressing HA-tagged SAG. Infection of this construct into JB6Cl.41 cells led to a 2.7-fold increase of SAG levels compared with
the control vector (Fig. 3A). This increased SAG level is within
the physiologic range and is comparable with the level induced by
TPA (see Fig. 2). These cells were then tested for both basal and
TPA-induced c-Jun levels. In control cells, c-Jun was detectable
and subjected to induction by TPA, starting at 1 h for 3-fold
increase and reaching a peak of 6.4-fold increase at 8 h. In contrast,
in SAG-infected cells, the basal c-Jun levels decreased f2- to 3-fold
and total TPA-induced levels were also reduced by 2-fold (Fig. 3B).
As a negative control, SAG overexpression had no effects on p53, a
protein not to be induced by TPA and not known to be a SAG
substrate. The results suggested that SAG could reduce c-Jun levels,
probably through promoting its degradation. To pursue this, we
treated cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, alone or in
combination with TPA. If c-Jun is targeted for degradation by SAG,
then MG132 should block it. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3C, MG132
alone treatment caused a slight increase in basal level of c-Jun
in control cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 versus 3) but a 2-fold increase in
SAG-overexpressed cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 versus 7), resulting in
similar c-Jun levels in both control and SAG-overexpressed cells
(Fig. 3C, lanes 3 versus 7). Accordingly, SAG-mediated inhibition
of c-Jun induction by TPA was also blocked by MG132 (Fig. 3C,
compare lanes 2 versus 6 and lanes 4 versus 8).
SAG silencing increases both the basal and TPA-induced
c-Jun levels in JB6-Cl.41 cells. We further tested this hypothesis
by using a lentivirus-based SAG siRNA silencing construct. Again,
it is expected that SAG silencing should increase the levels of c-Jun,

reduced both basal and TPA-induced c-Jun accumulation. Lentivirus-infected

densitometry quantification with h-actin normalization, setting the value in
LT-Con without TPA treatment as 1. C, MG132 blocked SAG-induced c-Jun

if it indeed promotes c-Jun degradation. As shown in Fig. 4A, lentiSAG siRNA infection of JB6-Cl.41 cells reduced endogenous SAG
levels by 80% compared with that of lenti-control siRNA infection,
indicating that endogenous SAG was indeed significantly silenced.
We then exposed these two lines to TPA for various periods of time
up to 8 h followed by immunoblotting analysis for c-Jun protein
levels. As shown in Fig. 4B, the basal level of c-Jun was very low but
detectable in LT-Cont–infected cells. The levels of c-Jun continuously increased and reached a peak induction of 10-fold at 8 h postTPA treatment. Significantly, in SAG silenced cells (LT-bSAGsi), the
basal level of c-Jun was increased up to 3-fold than that in the
control cells and TPA treatment further increased the c-Jun levels
up to a total of 18-fold. Unlike c-Jun, SAG silencing had no effect on
both basal and TPA-induced levels of c-Fos, an AP-1 component,
but not a SAG substrate (Fig. 4C). Finally, SAG silencing had, once
again, no effect on the levels of p53, which is neither inducible by
TPA, nor a SAG substrate (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggested
that SAG is involved in down-regulation of both basal and TPAinduced levels of c-Jun, but not of c-Fos, in mouse JB6-Cl.41 cells.
SAG silencing inhibits c-Jun ubiquitination and blocks
Fbw7-mediated c-Jun degradation. We next determined whether
SAG siRNA silencing would inhibit c-Jun polyubiquitination by a
commonly used in vivo ubiquitination assay (31). H1299 cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

transiently cotransfected with His-Ub and c-Jun, alone or in
combination of plasmid expressing control siRNA or SAG siRNA.
Ubiquitinated c-Jun was purified by Ni-NTA beads and detected by
antibody against c-Jun. As shown in Fig. 5A, c-Jun polyubiquitination can be readily detected in cells transfected with His-Ub, c-Jun,
and control siRNA (Fig. 5A, lane 4), indicating that endogenous SCF
components are sufficient to promote c-Jun polyubiquitination on
c-Jun overexpression via transfection. When cotransfected with
plasmid that silenced SAG expression (Fig. 5A, middle), c-Jun
polyubiquitination was remarkably inhibited (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Thus,
SAG is required for c-Jun polyubiquitination.
The F-box protein Fbw7 has been shown previously to promote
c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation (22, 39). Because Fbw7 is the
F-box component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase, it is likely that either
SAG or ROC1/Rbx1, the RING component of SCF, would be
required. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether
silencing SAG or ROC1/Rbx1 by siRNA would block Fbw7-induced
c-Jun degradation. Human 293 cells were transiently cotransfected
with Ub, c-Jun, and plasmids expressing Fbw7, alone or in
combination with psi-hSAG (to silence SAG) and/or psi-hRbx1
(to silence Rbx1/ROC1). As shown in Fig. 5B, endogenous c-Jun was
hardly detectable (Fig. 5B, lane 1), whereas exogenously transfected
c-Jun expressed well (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Consistent with a previous
report (22), cotransfection of c-Jun with Fbw7 reduced the level of
c-Jun by 5.6-fold (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 versus 2, from 1 to 0.18).
Remarkably, cotransfection of Fbw7 with psi-hSAG, which caused a
2.5-fold reduction of endogenous SAG level (Fig. 5B, middle top,
lanes 4 versus 1), reversed Fbw7-induced reduction of c-Jun from
5.6- to 1.3-fold (Fig. 5B, lane 4, from 1 to 0.18 and from 1 to 0.76).
Similarly, cotransfection with psi-hROC1, which caused a 2-fold
reduction of ROC1 (Fig. 5B, middle bottom, lanes 5 versus 1),
also partially reversed Fbw7-induced c-Jun degradation from 5.5- to
1.6-fold (Fig. 5B, lane 5, from 1 to 0.18 and from 1 to 0.62).
Simultaneously silencing both SAG and ROC1 (up to 2.5-fold of
each) by cotransfecting both psi-hSAG and psi-hROC1 further
inhibited c-Jun degradation by Fbw7 (Fig. 5B, lane 6). These results
clearly showed that SAG as well as ROC1 is required for Fbw7induced c-Jun degradation.
SAG expression inhibited TPA-induced soft agar colony
formation in JB6-Cl.41 cells. It has been well established that cJun induction and AP-1 activation play a key role in TPA-induced
tumor promotion (3, 5). Thus, by promoting c-Jun degradation,
SAG might be able to inhibit tumor promotion activity of TPA. We
tested this hypothesis by overexpressing SAG in JB6-Cl.41 cell line,
a well-established line that is sensitive to TPA-induced neoplastic
transformation as measured by anchorage-independent growth in
soft agar (40, 41). The lentivirus expressing HA-tagged SAG was
made and infected into JB6-Cl.41 cells to make stable SAGexpressing line, along with the vector control line. As shown in
Fig. 6A, lenti-SAG stable JB6-Cl.41 cells expressed HA-tagged SAG
at a level comparable with the endogenous SAG (Fig. 6A, right,
lane 3 compared with lanes 1 and 2), indicating that lenti-SAG
infection increased a total of SAG level by 2- to 3-fold. This is within
the physiologic range because the endogenous SAG can be induced
up to 3-fold after exposure to TPA (Fig. 2). All three JB6-Cl.41 lines
(parental, vector infected, and HA-SAG infected) were subjected to
soft agar assay to determine the effect of SAG expression on
anchorage-independent growth (a measure of cellular transformation) in the absence or presence of TPA. As shown in Fig. 6A (left),
all three lines had few background agar colonies in the absence
of TPA. TPA treatment dramatically increased the number of agar

colonies in parental cells, as expected. The vector virus infection
caused a further increase of agar colonies, consistent to our previous observation made with the plasmid vector transfection (32).
Significantly, exogenous SAG expression at the physiologic level
reduced number of TPA-induced agar colonies by 40%, which is
statistically significant (P < 0.05 compared with the parental
control). Thus, a 2- to 3-fold increase of the SAG level could inhibit
TPA-induced cellular transformation in mouse epidermal JB6-Cl.41
cells.
SAG silencing increased the numbers of soft agar colonies in
JB6-Cl.41 cells. Finally, we determined whether SAG siRNA

silencing, which caused c-Jun accumulation at both basal and
TPA-induced levels (Fig. 4), would promote cellular transformation
as measured by this soft agar anchorage-independent assay in the
absence or presence of TPA. As shown in Fig. 6B, lenti-SAG siRNA
infection significantly reduced the level of endogenous SAG
compared with scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 6B, right, lane 3
versus lanes 1 and 2). All these three lines were subjected to soft
agar assay to determine the effect of SAG silencing on anchorageindependent growth in the absence or presence of TPA. As shown
in Fig. 6B (left), in the absence of TPA, parental or control siRNAinfected cells formed few background agar colonies. However, SAG

P < 0.05, compared with parental cells (left).
B, SAG siRNA silencing increased soft agar colony
numbers in the absence or presence of TPA.

ANOVA analysis (Origin 75 Demo) was done
followed by Student’s t test. *, P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01,
compared with parental cells, respectively (left).

siRNA silencing caused a significant increase in soft agar colony
numbers, suggesting that SAG silencing partially transformed this
promoting sensitive line as a result of c-Jun accumulation. As
expected, TPA treatment dramatically increased the number of
soft agar colonies in parental cells as well as scrambled siRNAinfected cells. SAG silencing caused a further increase in soft agar
colony numbers with statistically difference from both control cells.
It is worthy noting that higher number of soft agar colonies was
observed in both untreated and TPA-treated cells in this experiment compared with what was shown in Fig. 6A. This is due to the
change of the serum lot number, a common phenomenon seen
in soft agar assay with JB6-Cl.41 cells. Our results clearly showed
that on SAG silencing to induce c-Jun accumulation, the tumor
promotion-sensitive JB6-Cl.41 was partially transformed with a significant increase in its ability to grow in an anchorage-independent
manner and that TPA treatment further enhanced this phenotype
of cell transformation.

Discussion
We have shown previously that SAG is a stress-responsive gene
that is induced by redox agents and ischemia/reperfusion in
multiple cell lines and normal tissues and acts as a cellular defense
mechanism to protect cells or tissues from apoptosis induced by
these stresses (16, 17, 33, 34). We report here that SAG is induced by
TPA via AP-1–mediated transcriptional activation. Four lines of
evidence presented in this study support notion that SAG is a direct
AP-1 target. (a) Several AP-1 consensus elements were identified
in the promoter of mouse SAG gene and AP-1 binds strongly to two
of such elements in vitro and in vivo. (b) The SAG promoter activity
is dependent of the true AP-1 binding sites. (c) Both SAG mRNA
and protein are induced by TPA, a typical AP-1 activator, and the
time course of SAG induction follows that of c-Jun induction. (d)
SAG induction by TPA is c-Jun/AP-1 dependent. Targeting c-Jun by
TAM67, a dominant-negative c-Jun mutant, significantly reduced
TPA-induced SAG expression. Many AP-1 target genes have been

www.aacrjournals.org

identified previously that regulate cell proliferation, tumor promotion, and apoptosis (3, 5, 42). The unique feature for identification
of SAG as yet another direct AP-1 target is that SAG is a component
of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase that on induction could in turn inhibit
AP-1 activity through promoting c-Jun degradation, thus establishing a negative feedback loop that keeps AP-1 activity in check.
C-Jun was shown to be ubiquitinated and degraded by at least
three types of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including SCF-Fbw7 (Skp1cullin-Fbw7; refs. 22, 39), DCX (DDB1, cullin 4A, and X-box protein;
ref. 23), and Itch (43, 44). ROC1/Rbx1, the RING component of SCF
and DCX E3 ubiquitin ligases, was implicated, but not directly
proven, in at least two c-Jun targeting E3s. Now, we showed here
that SAG is indeed involved in c-Jun ubiquitination and
degradation. When overexpressed, SAG remarkably reduced the
levels of both basal and TPA-induced c-Jun, whereas on SAG
silencing, both basal and TPA-induced levels of c-Jun were significantly increased. Furthermore, SAG silencing inhibited c-Jun
polyubiquitination and Fbw7-induced degradation, indicating a
requirement of SAG for c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation
through SCF-Fbw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our data also directly
showed that like SAG, ROC1/Rbx1, which has the same tissue
expression pattern as SAG (17, 45) but is expressed in a constitutive
manner,3 was also involved in promoting c-Jun ubiquitination and
degradation.
Mouse JB6 epidermal model consists of three variants with
distinct transformation response phenotypes as judged by anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar colony formation assay on
exposure to TPA: the variant with the promotion-resistant
phenotype (P-) is resistant to TPA-induced transformation, as
evident by its failure to form soft agar colonies in the presence of
TPA. The variant with promotion-sensitive phenotype (P+), to
which JB6-Cl.41 cells belong, is sensitive to TPA-induced transformation and will form agar colonies only in the presence of TPA.

The third variant with transformed phenotype (Tx) will form agar
colonies regardless of TPA. Thus, P-, P+, and Tx JB6 variants
represent earlier-to-later stages of preneoplastic-to-neoplastic
progression and provide an excellent cell model to study multistage
carcinogenesis (41). It has been shown previously that in this JB6
model, the AP-1 activity was progressively elevated during
preneoplastic-to-neoplastic progression (7) and blockage of TPAinduced AP-1 activity by a dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM67),
encoding a transcriptionally inactive product, inhibited transformation induced by TPA and epidermal growth factor (8). This
observation made in JB6 cell model has been extended to an in vivo
transgenic mice model, in which TAM67 was overexpressed in
mouse epidermal cells driven by a K14 promoter. Indeed,
overexpression of TAM67 inhibits in vivo tumor formation induced
by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/TPA chemical carcinogens as well as by UV exposure (35, 46). Likewise, we showed
here that overexpression of SAG in physiologic level in mouse JB6Cl.41 cells inhibited TPA-induced transformation, whereas SAG
silencing induced cellular transformation of tumor promotionsensitive JB6-Cl.41 cells. Furthermore, a SAG transgenic model, in
which SAG expression was targeted to the epidermal cells by the
K14 promoter (47), was generated and characterized. A decreased
incidence with a longer latent period for the formation of
papillomas induced by DMBA/TPA was also observed.4 Thus, AP1 activation indeed plays a critical role in multistage carcinogenesis, and inactivation of AP-1 through targeting its component,
such as c-Jun, would be a sound strategy for chemoprevention.
Our data presented here that (a) SAG is a direct AP-1 target, (b)
SAG is involved in c-Jun degradation, and (c) SAG expression
inhibits TPA-induced neoplastic transformation, establishing an
autofeedback loop of c-Jun/AP-1-SAG, in analogue to p53-Mdm2

(48). TPA exposure induces the levels of c-Jun and c-Fos as well as
c-Jun phosphorylation. Consequently, AP-1, consisting of Jun-Jun
homodimer or Jun-Fos heterodimer, is activated to transactivate
its target genes, leading to cell proliferation and tumor promotion
(3, 5, 49, 50). Activated AP1 also transactivates SAG. On induction,
SAG blocks AP1 effects through recruiting and complexing with
SCF-Fbw7 E3 ligase to promote c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation. Induction of SAG or SAG-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases
would therefore inhibit AP-1 activity, leading to inhibition of TPAinduced tumor promotion. Thus, SAG induction by TPA/AP-1 can
serve as a cellular defensive mechanism to shut off cell
proliferation and tumor promotion signals induced by prolonged
AP-1 activation. It is worthy noting, however, that up-regulation of
SAG by AP-1 will not only increase the activity of SAG-SCF-Fbw7
ligase to target c-Jun for degradation but may also induce the
degradation of many other SAG-SCF ligase substrates, dependent
on the availability of their specific F-box proteins. We therefore
cannot exclude the possibility that degradation of other proteins
may also contribute to SAG-mediated inhibition of neoplastic
transformation. Nevertheless, our study suggests that SAG, on
induction, inhibits TPA-induced neoplastic transformation and
could serve as a cancer prevention target whose induction may
help to delay the process of tumor promotion and progression
through elimination of c-Jun and inactivation of AP-1.
