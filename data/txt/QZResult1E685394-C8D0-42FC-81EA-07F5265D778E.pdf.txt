BACKGROUND: The long-term outcome of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib after failure of interferon alpha therapy has not been detailed. METHODS: In total, 368 patients were analyzed.
Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: Overall,
247 patients (67%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Of the 327 patients who were studied, 207
patients (63%) achieved a major molecular response (MMR), and 99 patients (30%) had undetectable breakpoint
cluster region/c-abl oncogene (BCR-ABL) levels at some time during therapy. The estimated 10-year survival rate was
68%, the progression-free survival rate was 67%, and the event-free survival rate was 51%. In multivariate analysis, age
60 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, bone marrow basophils 5%, any peripheral blasts, and clonal evolution were independent adverse factors for survival. The estimated 7-year survival rate according to the presence of no factors (n ¼
154), 1 or 2 factors (n ¼ 190), or 3 factors (n ¼ 24) were 93%, 70%, and 25%, respectively (P < .01). Achieving an
MMR, a CCyR, or a partial cytogenetic response at 12 months was associated with significantly better 10-year survival
rate in a landmark analysis (10-year survival rate, 80%-90%) compared with achieving a minor cytogenetic response
or a complete hematologic response (10-year survival rate, 55%-65%) or another response (10-year survival rate,
10%). In a landmark analysis that included imatinib response at 12 months, achieving a major cytogenetic response or
better (hazard ratio, 0.12; P < .001) and achieving a complete hematologic response or a minor cytogenetic response
(hazard ratio, 0.36; P ¼ .003) were significant favorable prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the estimated 10-year survival rate of 68% for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who receive imatinib

INTRODUCTION
Imatinib mesylate, a breakpoint cluster region/c-Abl oncogene (Bcr-Abl) selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI),
has revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML). Imatinib is now the frontline standard of care in CML.1-4 With imatinib therapy, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) is obtained in 80% to 85% of patients and is durable at 5 years in 67% of patients. The estimated
8-year survival rate of patients is 84% to 93%, depending on whether non-CML deaths are included or censored.2,4
The incidence of CML in the United States is about 5000 new cases annually.5 With a median survival of 3 to 6 years
before the widespread use of imatinib, the prevalence of CML was estimated at approximately 15,000 to 30,000 cases.
These patients either would have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or would have received interferon
alpha-based therapy. Thus, it is estimated that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States may have
received imatinib after interferon. The short-term follow-up of these patients revealed favorable results6-8; however, it is

important to determine their long-term prognosis to
decide whether such therapy continues to be beneficial
and to identify which patients should be considered for
alternative therapies, including second-generation TKIs
and allogeneic SCT. This analysis focuses on the very
long-term results of patients with chronic phase CML
who received imatinib after interferon failure at our institution. Compared with multi-institutional or pharmaceutical-sponsored studies, single-institutional studies may be
better at following the course of patients for events or progression after they are taken off the protocol imatinib
regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adults with Ph-positive CML in chronic phase who were
treated at our institution with imatinib therapy after interferon failure were included in this analysis. These patients
were entered on institutional review board-approved
protocols that were available at our institution during the
period. Informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The details of eligibility criteria,
treatment plan, and modifications have been detailed
previously.6-8
Response criteria were as previously described. A
cytogenetic response (CyR) was categorized as complete
(CCyR) if Ph-positive metaphases were reduced to 0%,
partial (PCyR) if Ph-positive metaphases were reduced to
1% to 35%, and minor if Ph-positive metaphases were
reduced to 36% to 90%.6-8 A major CyR (MCyR)
included CCyRs and PCyRs. Survival was calculated
from the start of therapy until death from any cause. The
time to progression to accelerated or blastic phase (progression-free survival [PFS]) was calculated from the start
of therapy until the development of accelerated or blastic
phase or until death from any cause on or off TKI therapy.
Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the start of
therapy until the development of any event leading to the
patient being off the study, including loss of MCyR, loss
of hematologic response, unacceptable toxicity, death
from any cause, or transformation to accelerated or blastic
phase. Survival, PFS, and EFS curves were analyzed with
the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared by using
log-rank tests.9 The cumulative incidence rates for CCyR,
complete molecular response (CMR), and major molecular response (MMR) were estimated by taking into
account the competing risks for events. Standard statistiCancer

cal methods were used for univariate and multivariate
survival analyses.10
Follow-up studies included bone marrow studies,
and cytogenetic and molecular analyses were performed
every 3 months in the first year, every 6 months in years 2
to 5, and at least every 6 to 12 months thereafter. It is
noteworthy that 95 patients were not followed regularly at
our institution after deciding not to continue on the
imatinib study protocol. Their subsequent outcome is
followed only for death as an event. Therefore, they are
censored at the time of last follow-up at M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center unless they die, at which time they would
be updated as death event for survival, PFS, and EFS.

RESULTS
In total, we analyzed 368 patients with Ph-positive CML
in chronic phase who received imatinib therapy after failure on interferon alpha. Their characteristics are detailed
in Table 1. Their median age was 54 years, and
121 patients (33%) were aged 60 years. The median
follow-up of patients on study was 114 months (range,
1-132 months).
Overall, 247 patients (67%) achieved a CCyR as
their best cytogenetic response. Of 326 patients who had
molecular studies, 207 (63%) achieved an MMR (BCRABL ratio on the international scale, 0.1%), and 99

(30%) had undetectable levels at some time during therapy. The cumulative incidence of MMR by 7 years was
55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45%-64%), and the
cumulative incidence of undetectable BCR levels was
35% (95% CI, 29%-42%). Considering the total denominator of 368 patients, in an intent-to-treat analysis at 7
years, 129 patients (35%) were in CCyR, 116 patients
(32%) were in MMR, and 40 patients (11%) had undetectable BCR-ABL levels.

Figure 1. Survival, progression-free survival (Progression),
and event-free survival (Event) are illustrated.

At the most recent follow-up, the estimated 10-year
survival rate was 68%, the PFS rate was 67%, and the EFS
rate was 51% (Fig. 1). Currently, 104 patients (28%)
have died. The causes of death are indicated in Figure 2.
Death in transformation was caused by accelerated phase
disease complications in 13 patients and by blastic phase
disease in 39 patients. Among the latter group, blastic
phase was lymphoid in 9 patients, myeloid in 24 patients,
and mixed lineage in 1 patient (5 patients had unknown
blastic phase morphology).
Among 256 patients (70%) in whom imatinib therapy was discontinued, 11 died on imatinib therapy from
non-CML causes (Fig. 2). One hundred eighteen patients
(35%) stopped the study imatinib for reasons other than
imatinib resistance, including no further follow-up at our
institution (n ¼ 95), patient request (n ¼ 4), physician
decision (n ¼ 3), socioeconomic factors (n ¼ 5), noncompliance (n ¼ 3), and other malignancies or diseases (n ¼
8). One hundred twenty-seven patients failed imatinib,
including 86 patients who remain in chronic phase and
41 patients who have transformed (blastic phase; n ¼ 14;
accelerated phase; n ¼ 27) (Fig. 2).
Sixty-two of 127 patients (49%) who failed on imatinib therapy received salvage therapy with second-generation TKIs as first salvage (nilotinib, 14 patients; dasatinib,
34 patients; others, 14 patients), and 27 patients received
second salvage therapy with second-generation TKIs. The

estimated 5-year survival of patients from the time of second-generation TKIs as salvage therapy is 60%.
In total, 10 patients were referred for allogeneic
SCT. Referral to transplantation was after the development of imatinib resistance in chronic phase for 4 patients
and in transformation for 6 patients. Currently, 3 patients
(30%) are alive without evidence of disease. (1 patient
relapsed received dasatinib treatment).
Prognostic factors associated with survival are listed
in Table 2. A multivariate analysis identified older age
(60 years), severe anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL), bone
marrow basophils 5%, the presence of any peripheral
blasts, and clonal evolution at the start of imatinib therapy
as independent adverse factors. Overall survival according
to the number of adverse factors is illustrated in Figure 3
and Table 3. Three risk groups were generated to predict
for long-term survival.
The outcome of patients according to their 12month response to imatinib is illustrated in Figure 4.

PCyR by 12 months had better outcomes, those who
achieved even a minor CyR or even a complete hematologic response had better outcomes than nonresponders.
By using a landmark analysis to include imatinib
response by 12 months, we identified the achievement of
an MCyR (hazard ratio, 0.12; P < .001), and a complete
hematologic response or a minor CyR (hazard ratio, 0.36;
P ¼ .003) as significant prognostic factors for long-term
outcome after the analysis was adjusted for covariates.

DISCUSSION
This study presents the unique experience of very longterm follow-up results from a single institution in patients
who received imatinib after interferon failure. We noted
favorable results with a 10-year survival rate of 68% and
an EFS rate of 51%.
Several recent studies have analyzed the outcome of
patients with CML on imatinib therapy in different contexts, and some have included patients who received imatinib after interferon failure.11,12 In the study by
Gambacorti-Passerini et al,11 832 patients who received
imatinib were reviewed. Among them, 478 patients
received imatinib as second-line therapy. Those authors
focused on the long-term side effects and safety profile of
imatinib, emphasizing the need for independent, multicenter assessment of outcomes in patients with CML. In a
population-based study of patients with CML who were
diagnosed in Sweden from 1973 to 2008, Bjorkholm et al
demonstrated the impact of introducing imatinib therapy
to a large CML population on long-term survival.12 In
their analysis, the 5-year cumulative relative survival rates
increased 20% to 50% during the years 1973 to 2000 up
to 80% since 2001, the year when imatinib therapy
started having increased penetration into CML therapy in
Sweden. Those authors did not separate outcome according to patients who received imatinib as frontline therapy
versus salvage therapy; however, they did demonstrate the

overall impact of introducing imatinib therapy to the total
CML population.
Our results and those of others8,11,12 are encouraging and suggest a major change in the natural course of
CML after interferon failure, which, of course, is partly
expected from the results of frontline imatinib therapy.
This clarifies the favorable outcome of patients after interferon failure, a group whose median survival was 3 years
when imatinib therapy was not available.7 In the current
study, the estimated 10-year survival rate of patients was
68% compared with 20% to 30% in the historic group of
patients who had failure on interferon therapy and had no
access to imatinib.7 This suggests that most patients can
be managed safely and effectively with imatinib after
interferon failure and do not have to consider the option
of allogeneic SCT as long as they are in CyR. Even if they
demonstrate imatinib resistance in chronic phase, subsequent salvage therapy with second-generation TKIs (second salvage in the context of this analysis; interferon
therapy frontline, imatinib therapy as salvage) can be
safely entertained as a durable therapeutic approach as
long as the patients are sensitive and responsive to imatinib therapy.
In multi-institutional studies, patients on TKI therapy often may not be followed adequately for events that
occur after they are taken off the study TKI, except for
death.1,2 This is because of limited resources as well as difficulties in following patients (for example, with bone
marrow studies or even routine blood tests that are not
prespecified in the protocol requirements). Our single-

Cancer

institutional study offers the opportunity of more precise
estimations of events after failure on TKI therapy, but it is
still limited by a lack of detailed follow-up in 95 of 368
patients (26%). The variability in the definitions of EFS
and PFS and its impact on perceived differences in outcome has been highlighted recently.13,14 In our study, we
used the most conservative definition of EFS in which all
events are counted, including the event of taking a patient
off TKI therapy for any reason. Therefore, a 10-year EFS
rate of 51% represents a reasonably favorable outcome for
this study group.
In summary, the current analysis confirms the efficacy and safety of continued imatinib therapy in patients
with Ph-positive CML after interferon failure and reassures patients who are currently on such therapy in the oncology community, and their treating physicians, that
continuation of this therapy is reasonable. Undertaking
allogeneic SCT should be considered only in patients who
develop imatinib resistance.
