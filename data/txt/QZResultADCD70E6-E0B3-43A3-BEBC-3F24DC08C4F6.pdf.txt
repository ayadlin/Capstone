Abstract

Author Manuscript

Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a class of protein synthesis inhibitors that selectively kill
aneuploid tumor cells and repress translation of specific mRNAs1-4. RocA targets eukaryotic
initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase; its mRNA selectivity is
proposed to reflect highly structured 5′ UTRs that depend strongly on eIF4A-mediated
unwinding5. However, rocaglate treatment may not phenocopy the loss of eIF4A activity, as these
drugs actually increase the affinity between eIF4A and RNA1,2,6. Here, we show that secondary
structure in 5′ UTRs is only a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and RocA does not repress
translation by reducing eIF4A availability. Rather, in vitro and in cells, RocA specifically clamps
eIF4A onto polypurine sequences in an ATP-independent manner. This artificially clamped eIF4A
blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature, upstream translation initiation and reducing protein
expression from transcripts bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the
mechanism of selective translation repression by this lead anti-cancer compound, we provide an
example of a drug stabilizing sequence-selective RNA-protein interactions.

We analyzed the global translational inhibition caused by RocA, as well as its marked
mRNA selectivity, using ribosome profiling7. RocA treatment of HEK 293 cells caused a
dose-dependent decrease in polysome formation and protein synthesis (Extended Data
Figures 1a and 2a). Translation was inhibited without 4EBP dephosphorylation or eIF2α
phosphorylation (Extended Data Figure 1b), but partially rescued by expression of RocAresistant eIF4A proteins6 (Extended Data Figure 1c and d). We quantified the reduction in
overall cytosolic ribosome footprints following normalization of our ribosome profiling data
against footprints from the mitochondrial ribosome8, which employs molecular machinery
distinct from the cytoplasmic translation apparatus (Figure 1a and Extended Data Figure 1eh). We saw that RocA sensitivity varied widely across different transcripts (Figure 1a and b
and Supplementary Tables 1a and b). This mRNA-specific translational repression occurred

even at a low, therapeutically relevant concentration of RocA (30 nM)1-4, correlated well
between different drug concentrations, and was not accompanied by significant changes in
mRNA abundance (Extended Data Figure 2b-d and Supplementary Table 1c).
Given that eIF4A acts during the scanning of the pre-initiation 43S complex along the 5′
UTR9, we reasoned that the varied RocA sensitivity of different mRNAs might be
determined by their 5′ UTR sequences. We confirmed that the 5′ UTRs of selected mRNAs
were sufficient to confer RocA sensitivity on a Renilla luciferase reporter, while the
scanning-independent HCV IRES10 was totally resistant to the drug (Figure 1c and
Extended Data Figure 2e). However, RocA sensitivity did not reflect either the calculated
thermodynamic stability or experimentally derived DMS-Seq secondary structure
measurement11 of the 5′ UTR, and the presence of predicted G-quadruplexes5 contributed
only modestly (Extended Data Figure 3).

Author Manuscript

Because RocA enhances the RNA affinity of eIF4A1,2,6, we suspected that it could induce
effects beyond the simple loss of eIF4A activity. Indeed, we found that the eIF4A inhibitor
Hippuristanol (Hipp), which decreases the affinity between eIF4A and RNA12,13, yields a
different spectrum of mRNA-specific repression (Extended Data Figure 4a-e). The mTOR
inhibitor PP242, which inhibits formation of eIF4F (a complex of eIF4E/G/A)14,15, represses
a subset of these Hipp-sensitive mRNAs (Extended Data Figure 4f and g). Thus, RocA
exerts effects beyond reduced eIF4A activity, particularly at low, therapeutic doses.

Author Manuscript

We next asked how RocA affected eIF4A occupancy across the transcriptome in cells by
sequencing transcripts that co-purified with streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tagged
eIF4A (Extended Data Figure 5) (RIP-Seq). Increasing RocA doses elevated the overall
amount of RNA that co-purified with SBP-tagged eIF4A, (Extended Data Figure 5d), and
greatly changed the abundance of individual transcripts, leading to 15-fold or larger
differences between mRNAs. Strikingly, enhanced eIF4A binding in the presence of RocA
correlated strongly with translation inhibition by RocA (Figure 1d and Extended Data Figure
5f), suggesting that a selective increase of the eIF4A-RNA affinity underlies the specific
translation inhibition caused by RocA.

Author Manuscript

This mRNA selectivity led us to explore the sequence preferences of eIF4A in the absence
and presence of RocA. We measured the RNAs that bound to eIF4A out of a random pool of
oligonucleotides using deep sequencing (RNA Bind-n-Seq)16 (Extended Data Figure 6a-c).
We then calculated the enrichment of 4- to 6-nt motifs in RNAs retained on eIF4A, as
DEAD-box RNA helicases typically contact 6 nt17. The motifs enriched from randomized
synthetic RNA by Bind-n-Seq also predicted RIP-Seq enrichments of endogenous transcripts
(Figure 2a and Extended Data Figure 6d). In both experiments, RocA greatly enhanced
binding to short polypurine sequences (Figures 2b and c and Extended Data Figure 6e).
Although drug-free eIF4A also had intrinsic RNA sequence preferences18 (Extended Data
Figures 6g and 8b and c) and transcripts containing these preferred sequences were relatively
resistant to Hipp treatment (Extended Data Figure 6h), RocA only selectively increases
binding to a subset of sequences containing polypurine stretches (Extended Data Figure 6g).

Polypurine motifs were also enriched in the eIF4A binding sites detected by
photocrosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP)19 following RocA treatment (Figure 2d
and Extended Data Figure 7), and in the 5′ UTRs of translationally RocA-sensitive mRNAs
(Figure 2e). This striking correspondence among in vitro binding to recombinant protein, ex
vivo co-purification, crosslinking in cells, and translational repression in cells led us to
hypothesize that selective binding to polypurine motifs induced by RocA binding could
explain mRNA-specific translational repression. We then directly confirmed that inserting
the polypurine motif into an unstructured CAA repeat 5′ UTR (Extended Data Figure 9a)20
sensitized the reporter to RocA inhibiton (Figure 2f).

We found that RocA-induced, sequence-selective eIF4A binding occurs through ATPindependent clamping that suffices to repress translation of the clamped mRNA. The cycle
of ATP-dependent RNA binding and subsequent release upon ATP hydrolysis is necessary
for the efficient RNA remodeling activity of eIF4A as well as its role in translation21. Drugfree eIF4A bound RNA only in the presence of ATP (AMP-PNP and ADP-BeFx) and
transition state (ADP-AlF4) analogues but not hydrolysis products (ADP + Pi). Remarkably,
RocA clamped eIF4A on polypurine RNA, but not CAA-repeat RNA, in an ATPindependent manner (Figure 3a and b and Extended Data Figure 8a and b). Bind-n-Seq
performed with ADP + Pi likewise recovered polypurine-enriched RNAs in the presence of
RocA and no detectable RNA in the absence of RocA (Figure 3c and Extended Data Figure
6i). RocA provided polypurine-specific RNA binding activity to mutant eIF4A defective for
ATP binding (VX4GKT)22, which does not bind to RNA at all without RocA (Extended
Data Figure 8d-f), and even to the truncated N-terminal domain of eIF4A, albeit with lower
affinity (Extended Data Figure 8g). The eIF4A/RocA complex dissociated far more slowly
from polypurine RNA than naïve eIF4A, even in the presence of ATP, whose hydrolysis
ordinarily permits rapid dessociation (Figure 3d). High RNA affinity in the ADP-bound state
can prolong RNA binding beyond the time required for adenosine nucleotide exchange to
restore the high-affinity ATP-bound state and thus greatly reduce the effective dissociation
rate. This effective dissociation rate from polypurine RNA measured in hydrolysable ATP
(reflective of the intracellular environment) becomes much slower than the ~1 minute
timescale of translation initiation23, and could serve to directly block the ribosome.

Author Manuscript

In order to probe how clamped eIF4A repressed translation, we recapitulated RocA-induced,
polypurine motif-specific translational repression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL)
(Extended Data Figure 9b and c). In this system, RocA treatment represses the formation of
48S pre-initiation complexes on the start codon of sensitive mRNAs, which we assessed
using a primer extension toeprinting assay20,24 (Figure 3e and Extended Data Figure 9d).
Surprisingly, we observed additional RocA-dependent toeprints on the 5′ UTR,
corresponding to the position of polypurine motifs (Figure 3e), even without eIF4F
recruitment (Extended Data Figure 9e). We recapitulated these toeprints using only purified
eIF4A and drug, showing that they reflect eIF4A/RocA complexes clamped directly onto
polypurine motifs, bypassing its canonical recruitment via cap and the eIF4F complex21
(Extended Data Figure 9f). RNase I footprinting revealed the full extent of the eIF4A
protected region centered on the motif (Figure 3f and Extended Data Figure 9g).

These eIF4F-independent eIF4A/RocA complexes directly repress translation. We preformed such stable complexes on an mRNA during a pre-incubation with recombinant
eIF4A and RocA, and then showed that they repressed its subsequent translation in the
absence of free RocA (Figure 4a). Recombinant forms of eIF4A bearing mutations that
disrupt either ATP binding or eIF4G binding still retained the ability to clamp onto
polypurine RNA in the presence of RocA (Extended Data Figures 8d-f,h-i, and 9h-i) and
repress translation from the RNA as strongly as wild-type eIF4A/RocA complex (Extended
Data Figure 9j). Furthermore, supplementation of recombinant eIF4A protein into an in vitro
translation reaction actually strengthened the repressive effect of RocA (Figure 4b and
Extended Data Figure 9k), confirming the dominant repressive effect of the eIF4A/RocA
complex. In contrast, translation repression by Hipp, which decreases the affinity between
eIF4A and RNA and thereby mimics a loss of its function, was relieved by the addition of
recombinant eIF4A.

Author Manuscript

Assembly of an eIF4A/RocA complex could in principle repress 48S formation by blocking
40S attachment to the 5′ end of an mRNA or subsequent 43S scanning along the 5′ UTR.
Because the impact of eIF4A/RocA bound to a single polypurine motif is unaffected by its
distance from the 5′ end (Extended Data Figure 9a and l), we infer that eIF4A/RocA bound
to these motifs blocks 43S scanning. We also found that eIF4A/RocA could inhibit
translation from the polio virus (PV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which bypasses
ordinary 40S recruitment but still depends on scanning (Extended Data Figure 9a)25 when
we inserted polypurine motifs in the scanned region (Figure 4c and Extended Data Figure
9m). Scanning inhibition suffices to explain repression by the eIF4A/RocA complex,
although our data do not exclude an additional effect on 40S loading.

Impediments to 43S scanning by stable hairpins26 or RNA-binding proteins27 can enhance
the translation from upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that otherwise would be
skipped. We observed that RocA treatment, but not Hipp treatment, caused an analogous
accumulation of translation on 5′ UTRs despite the global reduction in footprints on proteincoding sequences (CDSes) (Extended Data Figure 10a and b). This enhancement occurred
specifically on high-sensitivity transcripts (Figure 5d and Extended Data Figure 10c). The
uORFs activated by RocA showed enrichment of a polypurine motif 20-30 nt downstream of
the uORF initiation codon (Figure 5d, inset), reflecting the distance between the start site
and the leading edge of the scanning complex27. We tested directly whether eIF4A/RocA
complexes on polypurine motifs can drive cryptic upstream initiation using a reporter
mRNA with two alternative start sites that yield distinguishable protein isoforms. Insertion
of a polypurine motif 30 nt downstream of the earlier AUG increased translation initiation
from this codon upon RocA treatment (Figure 5e), confirming that clamped eIF4A/RocA
complexes on polypurine motifs drive upstream translation initiation. We found evidence
that that this enhanced upstream initiation could contribute to eIF4A/RocA-mediated
repression of downstream CDSes28, as RocA-sensitive transcripts showed more pre-existing
uORF initiation29 (Extended Data Figure 10d and e).
We have shown that RocA induces ATP-independent clamping of eIF4A onto polypurine
sequences, creating an inhibitory roadblock for the scanning ribosome (Figure 5d). Our
identification of the eIF4A/RocA binding motif provides the first observation of a drug that

stabilizes sequence-selective RNA-protein interactions30. RocA may bind near the RNA
interface on the N-terminal domain of eIF4A6, raising the possibility that the drug directly
contacts purine bases of target RNAs. Alternatively, RocA might induce a conformational
change leading to direct or indirect recognition of the polypurine motif by protein residues.
Future structural insight into this polypurine selectivity may enable rocaglate derivatives
with altered base selectivities that target different mRNA.

The 30-nt randomized RNA followed by 3′ DNA sequence for reverse transcription priming

Our read depth (~108 reads) is less than the theoretical complexity (430 ≈ 1018), so that the
probability that the same sequence appears multiple times in the library is quite low.
Therefore, we assumed that reads with exactly the same sequence and length in the library
reflect PCR duplicates and counted them only once. Motif enrichment in the range of
interest (4-6 nt) was calculated as the ratio of the motif frequency between libraries16.
Spearman’s correlation of motif number in 5′ UTR versus RIP-Seq -fold change caused by
RocA treatment was used as motif prediction in RIP-Seq. High scoring motifs were defined
as those with enrichment of the prediction or the enrichment is >1.5 standard deviation from
the mean in RIP-Seq and Bind-n-Seq, respectively.
Data analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome reference and the resulting aligned reads
were mapped to UCSC known reference genes, downloaded from UCSC genome browser
on July 2013. A UCSC bed file of known genes was used for the 5′ UTR analysis. For
mitochondria footprints alignments, we used the RefSeq genes track corresponding to the
mitochondrial chromosome (chrM), downloaded from UCSC genome browser. Specific Asite nucleotides were empirically estimated based on the length of each footprint. The offsets
were 14 for 26-29 nt and 15 for 30-31 nt. For mitochondria footprints, 9 for 26-27 nt, 11 for
28-29 nt, 12 for 30 nt, 13 for 31 nt, and 18 for 32-34 nt. For mRNA fragments, we used
offset 14. For measuring footprint density and mRNA fragments of RIP-Seq between
samples, we restricted our analysis to genes, which have at least 40 and 100 summed counts
in each sample, respectively. For CDSs, the analysis only included the transcript positions
beginning 15 codons following the start codon and stopping 5 codons preceding the stop
codon. For 5′ UTRs, we included the transcript positions from the 5′ end of the mRNA until
5 codons preceding the start codon. DESeq33 was used to calculate relative enrichment of
genes in the library, including the mitochondrial footprints and spike-in hRluc mRNA
counts. The calculated -fold change was re-normalized to the value of the summed
mitochondria footprints or the spike-in hRluc mRNA fragments.
High-sensitivity messages were defined as transcripts with reduction more than 2-fold from
the median, and with q value <0.01, between 3 μM RocA-treated and untreated cells. Low-

For calculation of ΔG, RNALfold (ViennaRNA Package)34 was run with −L30 −g options
on 5′ UTRs sequences from UCSC foldUtr5 table. The minimum ΔG along each 5′ UTR
was used as a representative free energy value for each gene.
The presence of G-quadruplexes was predicted with RNAfold (ViennaRNA Package). The
Gini differences across 5′ UTRs were calculated using published data11. Analysis was
restricted to the mRNAs bearing 5′ UTRs which have one or more reads on A/C positions on
average.

“uORF translation intensity” was calculated using published data29. To incorporate the
number and intensity of each upstream initiation site in the 5′ UTR, we calculated the
density of 5′ UTR footprints for each transcript as mentioned above, as the great majority of
these footprints derive from ribosomes trapped on first codons (Extended Data Figure 10c).
To normalize mRNA abundance in cells, we normalized the density by footprint counts from
the CDS start codon region using the genomic position between start codon and 6 nt
downstream. We restricted the analysis to transcripts with at least 10 counts from CDS start
codons and re-normalized the value to the median as 1.

Proteins (0-50 μM) were incubated in 14.4 mM HEPES-NaOH, 108 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 0.36 mM TCEP, 14.4% glycerol, 0.1% DMSO, and 10 nM 5′FAM-labeled RNA
with or without 50 μM RocA in 10 μl reaction for 30 min at 25 °C. The experiments were
performed with 1 mM AMP-PNP (for AMP-PNP), 1 mM ADP, 5 mM BeCl2, and 25 mM
NaF (for ADP-BeFx), 1 mM ADP, 5 mM AlCl3, and 25 mM NaF (for ADP-AlF4), or 1 mM
ADP and 1 mM Na2HPO4 (for ADP + Pi). For the condition without ATP analog, MgCl2
was omitted from the reaction.
For competition assay, the complexes were preformed with 1 mM ATP or AMP-PNP, 1 μM
eIF4A, 10 nM FAM-labeled RNA, and 50 μM RocA and chased with 100 μM non-labeled
RNA. Because of the low affinity, 50 μM eIF4A was used with ATP and DMSO.
Fluorescence polarization was measured using an Infinite F-200 PRO (TECAN). Kd and t1/2
was calculated with fitting to Hill equation and one-phase exponential decay equation,
respectively, by Igor Pro software (WaveMatrics).
