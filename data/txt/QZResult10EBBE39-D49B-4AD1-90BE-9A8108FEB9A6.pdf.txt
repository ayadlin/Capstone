Abstract
Preclinical and clinical evidence shows that antiangiogenic
agents can decrease tumor vessel permeability and interstitial
fluid pressure (IFP) in a process of vessel ‘‘normalization.’’
The resulting normalized vasculature has more efficient
perfusion, but little is known about how tumor IFP and
interstitial fluid velocity (IFV) are affected by changes in
transport properties of the vessels and interstitium that are
associated with antiangiogenic therapy. By using a mathematical model to simulate IFP and IFV profiles in tumors,
we show here that antiangiogenic therapy can decrease IFP
by decreasing the tumor size, vascular hydraulic permeability,
and/or the surface area per unit tissue volume of tumor
vessels. Within a certain window of antiangiogenic effects,
interstitial convection within the tumor can increase dramatically, whereas fluid convection out of the tumor margin
decreases. This would result in increased drug convection
within the tumor and decreased convection of drugs, growth
factors, or metastatic cancer cells from the tumor margin
into the peritumor fluid or tissue. Decreased convection of
growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-C
(VEGF-C), would limit peritumor hyperplasia, and decreased
VEGF-A would limit angiogenesis in sentinel lymph nodes.
Both of these effects would reduce the probability of
lymphatic metastasis. Finally, decreased fluid convection into
the peritumor tissue would decrease peritumor edema
associated with brain tumors and ascites accumulation in
the peritoneal or pleural cavity, a major complication with a
number of malignancies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2729–35]

Introduction
Interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is elevated in tumors in cancer
patients (Table 1; ref. 1). We have previously shown that this
elevated pressure is a result of the abnormal structure and function
of blood and lymphatic vessels in tumors. The leaky vessels in
tumors lack permselectivity and are unable to sustain the
hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients across the vessel wall
(2, 3). As a result, IFP, which is close to zero in most normal tissues,
is nearly as high as the microvascular pressure (MVP) in tumors

(4, 5). Tumor vessel leakiness is so extreme that a sudden,
pharmacologically induced change in MVP results in an equivalent
change in IFP, delayed by only about 10 s (6, 7). This suggests there
is unhindered fluid communication between the blood and
interstitial spaces in tumors.
In normal tissues, lymphatic vessels drain excess fluid to
maintain the IFP close to zero, but tumors do not seem to have
functional lymphatic vessels. In many tumors, there are no
structures that stain for lymphatic endothelial markers. In those
tumors that do have structures that seem to be lymphatics via
immunohistochemistry, the structures do not transport fluid or
macromolecules (8–10). The lack of functional lymphatics in
tumors contributes to the elevated IFP and probably results from
compression of these vessels by proliferating cancer cells (11) and/
or impaired lymphatic valves (12). The absence of lymphatic
function in tumors is quite surprising, considering the prevalence
of lymphatic metastasis from these tumors (9, 13): it is difficult to
reconcile the prevalence of lymphatic metastasis with the lack of
intratumor conduits for cell entry. Our hypothesis is that the
lymphatics in the tumor margin are adequate for lymphatic
metastasis (8, 9). However, whether and how the elevated IFP in
tumors facilitates lymphatic metastasis remains to be elucidated.
To gain insight into the etiology and implications of elevated
tumor IFP, we developed a mathematical model in 1988 to simulate
fluid and macromolecular transport in tumors (14–17). The most
striking prediction of this mathematical model, confirmed in 1990
experimentally (18), was that the IFP is relatively uniform
throughout the tumor and decreases precipitously in the tumor
margin. Because fluid convection, or bulk flow, requires pressure
gradients, the model also predicted that convection would be
negligible throughout the tumor but significant near the tumor
margin. Prior and subsequent experimental studies were in concert
with our model predictions, showing that fluid flow rates from the
tumor margin calculated by our model were of the same order of
magnitude as those measured in transplanted tumors in rodents
(19–21) and colon carcinomas in patients (22).
We propose that in addition to creating peritumor edema and
ascites, the fluid flowing from the tumor margin transports tumorgenerated molecules and cells that facilitate angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis (Fig. 1). Therefore, any therapeutic
strategy that can lower the rate of fluid seepage from the tumor
margin is likely to interfere with tumor dissemination and alleviate
peritumor edema and ascites. Using our mathematical model, we
show here that antiangiogenic therapy is one such strategy that can
have a profound effect on tumor vessel transport properties,
lymphatic metastasis, and tumor-associated edema.
Other recent, counter-intuitive findings have also prompted us
to revisit our 1988 model. First, anti–vascular endothelial growth
factor (anti-VEGF) or anti-VEGFR2 therapy has been shown to

peritumor lymphatics, increasing their flow capacity and facilitating
cancer cell transport to nearby lymph nodes; this process can be
inhibited by an anti-VEGFR3 antibody (32). Fourth, VEGF-A overexpression in the primary tumor can induce lymph node angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and promote lymphatic metastasis
from some tumors (33, 34). Fifth, oral VEGF receptor kinase
inhibitors can alleviate ascites formation in an ovarian cancer model
in mice (35) and edema in patients with recurrent brain tumors (36).
Here, we show that our mathematical model can be used to
integrate these seemingly diverse observations in a unified framework and to elucidate how vascular normalization by anti-VEGF
therapies can (a) improve the convection of therapeutics in tumors,
(b) decrease the shedding of metastatic cells and growth factors
out of tumors, and (c) alleviate peritumor edema and ascites
formation.

‘‘normalize’’ tumor vessels (23, 24) and to reduce IFP in a variety of
tumors in mice and in rectal carcinomas in patients (refs. 25–30;
Table 2), but it is unclear how these changes in IFP influence fluid
convection within and out of the tumor. Second, direct and indirect
anti–VEGF/VEGFR2 therapy can improve the penetration of
therapeutics in tumors (26, 31). This observation might be explained
by better convection within tumors due to restored transvascular
pressure gradients. Third, VEGF-C induces lymphatic hyperplasia in

Mathematical model. We employ here a mathematical model of a tumor
growing as an isolated mass in a body cavity (e.g., peritoneal cavity, case I) or
embedded in a host organ (case II; refs. 14, 15). The model predicts how
different transport properties of the vessel wall and the interstitium affect
tumor IFP and interstitial fluid velocity (IFV). At each radial position, the
relative IFP (P̂) and relative IFV (û i) can be expressed as a function of a single
variable, a (see Online Supplement for details). P̂ is the interstitial pressure
relative to the ‘‘effective pressure’’ P e defined as P e = MVP r (kv ki).
In tumors, kv  ki so that P e is approximately equal to MVP;
therefore, P̂ is the interstitial pressure relative to microvascular pressure.
a represents the ratio of the rate of water movement across the blood
vessel wall to the rate through the interstitial matrix. Mathematically, a is

Figure 1. The tumor is modeled as a
sphere of radius R embedded in a body
fluid (e.g., peritoneal cavity, pleural cavity)
or host tissue. The interstitial fluid oozing
from the tumor periphery carries
therapeutics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies),
growth factors (e.g., VEGF-A, VEGF-B,
VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), and cells (e.g.,
metastatic cells) into the surrounding
fluid/tissue. The result may be higher fluxes
of cancer cells and growth factors from the
tumor into the surrounding tissue or body
fluid. The growth factors (including
VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D)
can induce angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis, and the cancer cells
can contribute to metastatic dissemination
via the lymphatic or blood vessels. Fluid
seeping from the tumor surface can also
cause edema (e.g., around brain tumors)
and ascites formation (e.g., ovarian
cancer). Antiangiogenic therapy can
normalize the tumor vasculature, leading to
lower IFP at the center, less steep IFP
gradients, and lower fluid flow rates at the
tumor margin, thus potentially reducing
peritumor edema, ascites formation, and
lymphatic metastasis. Furthermore, the
normalized vessels may be more resistant
to cancer cell intravasation, a prerequisite
for hematogenous metastasis.

. Here, K is the tissue hydraulic conductivity (cm2/mm Hg/s),
equal to R KV
and L p is the vascular hydraulic permeability (cm/mm Hg/s). These
variables describe the ease with which water moves through the interstitium
(K) and across the vessel wall (L p). R is the tumor radius, and S/V is the
surface area of vessel wall per unit volume of tissue (cm 1). The rate of fluid
seeping from the tumor margin into the peritumor fluid or tissue is simply
a product of the IFV at the tumor margin and the surface area of tumor
(i.e., 4kR 2).
These variables are expected to change with tumor growth and
treatment. For example, VEGF produced by cancer and host cells in a
tumor can increase the number and size of the pores in the vessel wall
(37, 38), which would increase L p and, in turn, a. Conversely, anti-VEGF
therapy can decrease the size of pores, vessel surface area, and tumor radius
and thus would decrease a. The model predicts that these changes in a will
affect the fluid pressure and flow within, and out of, the tumor. a influences
IFP and IFV in a complicated, nonintuitive way; therefore, we used our
mathematical model to help understand and quantify these effects.
To use our model to predict tumor IFP and IFV, we need direct
measurements or estimates of all the model variables. None of these
values were available for tumors in 1988 when this mathematical model
was originally developed (14, 15). Fortunately, in the intervening years, we
and others have been able to experimentally determine most of the
necessary variables in tumor and normal tissue. For example, we recently
measured IFP, MVP, and intravascular and extravascular oncotic pressures
in both the untreated and anti-VEGFR2 antibody–treated murine
mammary carcinoma MCaIV transplanted in mice (26). In what follows,
we estimate the remaining variables before and after vascular normalization of a given tumor. Then we calculate IFP and IFV profiles (see the
Online Supplement for details of the calculations) and compare the
calculated IFP with the measured values of IFP (Table 2). We then use our
validated model to calculate fluid loss from the tumor periphery before
and after antiangiogenic therapy for different sets of model variables. The
model results help to reconcile contradictory data in the literature on IFP
and lymphatic metastasis in animal and human tumors and show how
vascular normalization can alleviate per-tumor edema and ascites
formation.
Estimation of L p and K. Vascular hydraulic permeability has been
measured in various normal tissues in a variety of animals (3). For
capillaries in skeletal muscle in rats, L p was calculated to be 3.6  10 8 cm/
s/mm Hg (39). We used this value for normal tissue.
For tumors, we measured a capillary filtration coefficient (i.e., L pS/V ) of
f2.7 cm3/min/100 g/mm Hg (21). Assuming S/V = 250 cm2/cm3 (40), this
translates to a hydraulic permeability of 1.86  10 6 cm/s/mm Hg. To
estimate how L p changes with antiangiogenic treatment, we use data from
experiments in which we measured hydraulic permeability with and
without VEGF treatment. We found that the addition of VEGF causes a
5-fold increase in L p in monolayers of endothelial cells (41). This agrees
well with values measured in various animal models. For example, Pocock

et al. (42) found that VEGF induced a 3.8-fold increase in L p in frog
mesentery, and Bates and Curry (43) found a 7.8-fold increase in a similar
system.
Therefore, we assume a 5-fold decrease in L p when tumors are treated
with an anti-VEGFR2 antibody. Thus, L p of normalized vessels was
estimated to be 3.7  10 7 cm/mm Hg/s. This 5-fold decrease is likely an
underestimate considering that both perivascular cell and basement
membrane coverage increase in MCaIV tumors during normalization (26).
These processes, absent in the in vitro experiments, would be expected to
further fortify the endothelial barrier.
For transport through the interstitium, hydraulic conductivity values (K)
vary widely depending on the tissue type. For example, lung is extremely
conductive, with K of f500 cm2/s/mm Hg, whereas cartilage has low
conductivity, in the range of K = 0.01 to 0.1 cm2/s/mm Hg. Mesentery and
skin fall in between these extremes, with values in the range 10 to 100 cm2/
s/mm Hg (2). For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that normal tissue
hydraulic conductivity will not be too different from the tumor embedded
within it. In other words, the tumor originates from the host cells in which
it resides; thus, as a first approximation, K may be the same for the tumor
and normal tissue. We have measured K for a number of tumors and have
used a representative value of 2.5  10 7 cm2/s/mm Hg for MCaIV tumors
(44). How the hydraulic permeability of the interstitium changes with
antiangiogenic treatment is not known; thus, we assume K to be the same
before and after normalization.
Estimation of S/V. S/V was calculated from intravital images of tumor
vasculature (40, 45). This variable showed a large amount of heterogeneity
across tumor types as well as within individual tumors. The values generally
fall in the range of 50 to 250 cm 1 for normal tumor and normalized tumor
vasculature; thus, in the analysis, we consider the entire range. Regardless,
as shown in multiple tumor models, antiangiogenic therapy will lower S/V
compared with pretreatment levels.
Estimation of oncotic pressure contribution. The oncotic pressure
contribution, which counters the hydrostatic pressure difference across the
vessel wall in normal tissue, is given by r (kv ki). The oncotic pressure
coefficient r is determined by the size of the largest pores in the vessel wall.
The larger the pore size, the less selective the vessel wall will be, leading to a
smaller value of r. Decreases in pore size by antiangiogenic therapy might
cause induction of permselectivity (increased r) and establishment of an
oncotic pressure difference inside versus outside the vessels. This would
lower IFP and fluid convection throughout the tumors. As shown next, our
ki) is very small, even after
analysis suggests, however, that r (kv

influence water convection across tumor vessels.
In normal tissue, the value of r for albumin varies between 0 for the liver
(with a high vascular permeability) and 1 for the impermeable brain vessels,
with lung falling in the middle of the range with a r of 0.5 (3). In our
simulations, we used r of 0.91 for normal tissue, measured for albumin in
s.c. tissue (see Table 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Because there are no

measurements of r for tumors, we estimated it using a spherical solute/
cylindrical pore model (46, 47). In this model, albumin was modeled as a
solid sphere, and the vascular wall was assumed to have cylindrical pores.
r can be estimated as r = [1 (1 k)2]2, where k = r s (solute radius)/r o
(pore radius). Bovine serum albumin is reported to have a hydrodynamic
radius of around 3.5 nm (2, 3). Using a functional assay, the maximum
diameter of vascular pores in MCaIV tumors implanted in the dorsal
skinfold chamber was found to be between 1.2 and 2 Am (37). Analysis of
scanning electron microscopy measurements in the same tumors gave
similar results, with intercellular openings of 1.7 Am in diameter and
transcellular holes of 0.6 Am in diameter (38). Thus, for this analysis, we
assumed the pore diameter to be 1.5 Am. Based on the solute and pore radii,
the calculated r was 8.7  10 5, a value consistent with the extremely leaky
vessels in the MCaIV tumor.
To estimate the value of r in normalized vessels, we used the pore size
measured after hormone withdrawal from a hormone-dependent tumor.
Hormone withdrawal from a hormone-dependent Shionogi mammary
tumor leads to a decrease in VEGF level, similar to VEGF blockade by an
anti-VEGF antibody, and a decrease in maximum pore size to about one
fifth of its baseline value (37, 48). Thus, we estimated the pore size of
normalized blood vessels to be 300 nm (one fifth of the baseline value); in
this case, the calculated r was still quite low (i.e., 2.1  10 3). Even a 20-fold
decrease in pore size would only increase r to 0.03.
Recently we measured MVP, kv, and ki in MCaIV tumors before and
after anti-VEGFR2 therapy. In this study, MVP and kv did not change
significantly (pretreatment: MVP = 5.5 mm Hg, kv = 19.8; posttreatment:
MVP = 5.3 mm Hg, kv = 19.2 mm Hg), and there was only a slight
decrease in ki (pretreatment: ki = 17.3; posttreatment: ki = 15.1 mm Hg;
ref. 26). Thus, the oncotic pressure difference across the vessel wall is
small in tumors (f2 mm Hg) and is not greatly affected by VEGF
blockade, at least in this limited study. Thus, given the small values for r
and oncotic pressure gradients, oncotic pressure–induced fluid flux across
the vascular wall is negligible in this tumor. Table 3 summarizes the
variable values used in our model simulations, and Supplementary Table S2
gives the literature references used to estimate these values.

Results and Discussion
Effect of vascular normalization on IFP profiles. Our lab and
others’ have shown that antiangiogenic therapy can lower the IFP
in transplanted and spontaneous tumors (Table 2), without
lowering the MVP or altering lymphatic function. However, there
are no measurements to date of the changes in the spatial profile of
IFP in tumors after antiangiogenic therapy. Previously, we showed
that our model can predict the IFP profiles in untreated tumors

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

(18); we now extend it to the analysis of tumors treated with
antiangiogenic therapy.
To compare our calculations with the published data of Tong
et al. (26), we assume variable values (such as tumor radius) consistent with that study (Table 3). Using Eqs. 8 to 13 in the Online
Supplement, we calculated the IFP (Fig. 2A and C) and IFV (Fig. 2B
and D) profiles for cases I and II using various values of a. The
striking result is that there is a range of a in which IFP and IFV are
extremely sensitive. For example, changing a from 1 to 10 raises
relative IFP in the center of the tumor from <0.2 to 1. Further
increases in a do not affect IFP except near the margin. Untreated
tumors are expected to have a values in the range of 7 to 17
(Table 3). As shown in Fig. 2A and C, these values lead to saturation
of relative IFP that extends almost to the tumor margin, with MVP
equal to IFP except in a thin shell near the boundary. This is similar
to the results from our previous studies of untreated tumors
(18). Antiangiogenic therapy lowers both L p and S/V, resulting in
a values in the range of 3.5 to 8 (Table 3). Interestingly, this is the
range in which IFP decreases dramatically with decreases in a,
producing significant IFP gradients and convection within the
tumor (Fig. 2B and D; e.g., a = 5, green line).
The most important message from these simulations is that the
mechanism of IFP reduction in tumors by vascular normalization
depends on the baseline transport properties of the tumor. Moving
a from 50 to 10 will have little effect on IFP, but moving from 10 to
1 will have dramatic consequences. This is further elucidated in
Fig. 3A and C, which shows the relationship between the relative
IFP at the center of the tumor, where IFP is maximum, and a. For a
greater than f6, the value of relative IFP levels off inside the
tumor, becoming insensitive to changes in a. This is because the
MVP is balanced by the IFP and a small oncotic pressure difference,
and there is nearly zero fluid flux across the vessel walls in most
regions of the tumor. Despite a 25-fold increase in permselectivity
(r) by anti-VEGF therapy, the decrease in IFP is small (<1 mm Hg).
The fluid that does flow out of the tumor comes from the vessels
near the periphery (Fig. 1).
For tumors that have a < 6, changes in a have a significant effect
on IFP. In these tumors, a (and IFP) can be lowered by decreasing
the hydraulic permeability of tumor vessels (L p), surface area of
tumor vessels (S/V ), or tumor radius (R) or by increasing the
hydraulic conductivity of the tumor matrix (K). Indeed, antiangiogenic therapies have been shown to lower three of these variables
in tumors (L p, S/V, and R). Whether these therapies can also
increase the hydraulic permeability (K) of tumors is not known. In
any case, these simulations indicate that the magnitude of IFP
change in a given tumor depends on the range of a values
achievable.
Effect of vascular normalization on IFV. Unlike IFP, there
are no reported measurements of IFV profiles in tumors. In cases
in which experimental data are difficult to obtain, a mathematical model can provide useful insight, as long as it can be
validated independently. We previously validated our model by
comparing the rate of fluid loss from the surface of a tumor with
that predicted by the model (14, 15). In subsequent work, the
model predictions were consistent with measurements of fluid
loss from human colon carcinomas surgically excised from
patients (22). Thus, the model seems to provide reasonable
predictions of IFV.
With this as a basis, we calculated the IFV profiles with various
values of a. As shown in Fig. 2B, there is a regime near a = 5 in
which convection within the tumor is higher, but flow from the

Vascular Normalization by Antiangiogenic Therapy

boundary is lower than tumors with higher a values (i.e., the lines
cross). This is due to the lowering of IFP, which allows
redistribution of flow: flux from vessels at the periphery decreases,
and that from deeper vessels increases (Fig. 2B and D). Again, this
is within the range of a that we estimate for normalized tumors.
Thus, drugs injected before normalization might be washed out
directly from peripheral vessels across the tumor boundary, but
delivery of injected drugs after normalization would be significantly improved inside the tumor, whereas less drugs will be
washed out of the tumor margin. Note that in tissue with a less
than f1, IFP will be close to 0, with hardly any gradient in the
interstitium, and IFV will be correspondingly small everywhere.
Thus, excessive decreases in a could hinder drug delivery.
These results have important implications for cancer prevention
and treatment. Increased intratumor convection is likely to
facilitate distribution and penetration of therapeutics throughout
the tumor, and decreased fluid loss from the tumor surface is likely
to decrease the convective loss (bulk flow) of therapeutics or
growth factors (e.g., VEGF-A and VEGF-C) into the surrounding
fluid/tissue. In addition to alleviating peritumor edema, measured
in brain tumor patients (36), a decrease in the delivery of VEGF-A
will decrease the likelihood of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
in the nearby tissues and lymph nodes, and a decrease in delivery
of VEGF-C will attenuate hyperplasia of peritumor lymphatics.
Finally, in addition to a decrease in ascites from ovarian cancer,
measured in mice (35), the reduction in fluid loss from the tumor
margin is likely to decrease the delivery of cancer cells into the
body cavities (e.g., peritoneal or pleural cavity) or to the hyperplastic lymphatics in the tumor margin.

In tumors with a close to 5 after antiangiogenic therapy, it is also
possible that the flux of growth factors reaching the draining lymph
nodes will be decreased due to less fluid flow from the boundary
(Fig. 2D); this could also inhibit lymph node lymphangiogenesis
(33). Lymph node lymphangiogenesis is thought to increase the
incidence of lymph node metastasis, potentially by providing
additional opportunities for cell entry into the lymphatic system.
Collectively, these simulations suggest that antiangiogenic therapy
and the resulting vascular normalization will improve the delivery/
penetration of therapeutics in tumors, alleviate peritumor fluid
accumulation, and, at the same time, decrease the shedding of
cancer cells into peritumor fluid or tissue.
Relationship between IFP and lymphatic metastasis. It is
tempting to assert that elevated IFP should increase lymphatic
metastasis: indeed, one study in the literature supports this notion
(49). On the other hand, we and others have not seen any
correlation between these two variables (9, 50). Our hypothesis is
that it is not the IFP but the gradient of IFP in the tumor margin
(which is proportional to the rate of fluid ‘‘seeping’’ from the tumor
surface) that determines how much VEGF-A/VEGF-C/VEGF-D and
how many cancer cells enter the peritumor lymphatics. In any
system, flow rate is determined by pressure gradients rather than
absolute pressure. We used our model to address this question by
calculating the relative IFP in the tumor center (IFPmax) and IFV at
the tumor boundary (IFVmax). As shown in Fig. 3A and C, we find
that IFPmax is relatively insensitive to a for a > 6, typical values for
tumors, but it decreases monotonically for a < 6. IFVmax also
decreases significantly as a decreases (Fig. 3B). As a result, the
relationship between IFVmax and IFPmax is not strictly linear

B and D, velocity profiles. a represents the
ratio of rate of fluid filtration across the
vessel wall and that across the interstitial
matrix. Relative distance <1 represents
region within the tumor, whereas >1
represents region outside of the tumor.
Note that as a decreases, tumor pressure
begins to decrease, and fluid velocity
begins to increase in the center of tumors.
On the other hand, as a decreases, the
velocity at the tumor boundary decreases.
For the calculations in C and D, a for
normal tissue was assumed to be 2.0.
Relative IFP is the actual local IFP divided
by the ‘‘effective’’ pressure [P e = P v r
(kv ki)], which is approximately P v
because kv is close to ki, and r is nearly
zero in tumor tissue. Relative IFV is
defined as the local velocity relative to an
effective, or average, bulk velocity at the
margin, calculated as though IFP were
uniform throughout the tumor: K (P e)/R
(see Online Supplement for details).

Figure 3. Relationships between IFP near
the tumor center and the fluid convection
from the margin. Influence of a on the
relative IFP at the center of the tumor and
the fluid velocity at the tumor margin for
isolated (A ) and embedded tumor (C ).
This information is displayed again in (B )
and (D ), but with IFV at the boundary
shown as a function of the pressure in the
tumor center. Note that when a is greater
than f5, IFP is uniformly high throughout
the tumor. Further increases in a cannot
produce additional increases in IFP but do
increase fluid flux from the margin. This
implies that in this regime, where many
tumors fall, fluid convection (and probably
rates of metastasis) is insensitive to IFP at
the center of the tumor.

(Fig. 3C and D). Assuming lymphatic metastasis is proportional to
IFVmax (32), it is likely to be independent of IFP for most tumors,
where a > 6. However, for tumors in which a < 6, lymphatic
metastasis is likely to be proportional to IFP.
In conclusion, we show here that vascular normalization can
decrease tumor IFP in a number of ways: increasing tumor
hydraulic conductivity (K) and/or by lowering vessel hydraulic
permeability (L p), surface area to volume ratio (S/V ), or tumor size
(R). We also show that the fluid convection into the peritumor
tissue or fluid can be lowered by normalizing the structure of tumor
vessels and decreasing tumor size and/or its hydraulic permeability.
Thus, normalization is likely to decrease peritumor edema, a major
cause of morbidity in brain tumors (36). Decrease in convective flow
from the tumor margin is also likely to lower the dissemination of
cancer cells to the body fluid surrounding a tumor mass, when the
tumor is located in a body cavity (e.g., peritoneal cavity). If the
tumor is located in host organ with lymphatics, then the decreased convective flow out of the tumor is likely to decrease
dissemination of cancer cells to lymph nodes. Additionally, the

decreased convective flow of growth factors at the edge of the tumor
may reduce angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the draining
lymph nodes. Finally, the normalized vessels fortified by pericytes
will be resistant to cancer cell invasion, a prerequisite for hematogenous metastasis. It is important to point out that the vascular
normalization could be brought about not only by blocking VEGF
or VEGFR2 but also possibly by blocking VEGF-C or VEGFR3, as a
fraction of tumor vessels are VEGFR3 positive (8). In addition,
endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as thrombospondin,
endostatin, and tumstatin, could also do the same (24, 51).
