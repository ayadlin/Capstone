Abstract
Translocations of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene occur
in 60% to 80% of all infant acute leukemias and are markers of
poor prognosis. MLL-AF9 and other MLL fusion proteins aberrantly recruit epigenetic regulatory proteins, including histone
deacetylases (HDAC), histone methyltransferases, bromodomain-containing proteins, and transcription elongation factors
to mediate chromatin remodeling and regulate tumorigenic gene
expression programs. We conducted a small-molecule inhibitor
screen to test the ability of candidate pharmacologic agents
targeting epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory proteins to
induce apoptosis in leukemic cells derived from genetically engineered mouse models of MLL-AF9–driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib and

HDAC inhibitor panobinostat were the most potent inducers of
apoptosis in short-term in vitro assays. Treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemic cells with dinaciclib resulted in rapidly decreased
expression of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, and accordingly,
overexpression of Mcl-1 protected AML cells from dinaciclibinduced apoptosis. Administration of dinaciclib to mice bearing
MLL-AF9–driven human and mouse leukemias elicited potent
antitumor responses and signiﬁcantly prolonged survival. Collectively, these studies highlight a new therapeutic approach to
potentially overcome the resistance of MLL-rearranged AML to
conventional chemotherapies and prompt further clinical evaluation of CDK inhibitors in AML patients harboring MLL fusion
proteins. Cancer Res; 76(5); 1158–69. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

less, treatment responses and outcome to this regimen vary from
primary refractory disease to cure (2). Chromosomal abnormalities are found in 50% to 80% of AML cases with rising incidences
in patients with secondary leukemia or older age. Frequently
found abnormalities include chromosome loss or deletion
(e.g., 5, 7, Y, and 9) and translocations such as t(16;16)/inv
(16), t(8;21)(q22;q22); t(15;17)(q22;q21). These and other class
II mutations occur concomitantly with class I mutations activating
oncogenes such as RAS, FLT3, and KIT to cooperatively drive AML
onset and progression (3).
Translocation of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is an
independent predictor of poor prognosis. MLL has been found in
73 different translocations and 54 partner genes have been
cloned. MLL fusion proteins (MLL-FP) share a common structure
with the respective partners invariably fused in-frame to MLL,
resulting in maintenance of DNA-binding capacity but altered
transcriptional regulatory capacity (4, 5). Many MLL-FPs recruit
large macromolecular transcription regulatory complexes such as
the super elongation complex (SEC) and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc; refs. 6–10). Important epigenetic
enzymes and regulatory proteins that interact with MLL-FPs as
a part of the SEC, PAFc, or through direct interaction with MLL-FPs
include the positive transcription elongation factor b (pTEFb)
consisting of CDK9 and cyclin T1 that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, the
acetylated lysine-binding bromodomain-containing "chromatin
reader" protein BRD4, the methyltransferase PRMT1, the histone
demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A), and the histone methyltransferase

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute
leukemia affecting adults accounting for approximately 25% of all
leukemias in adults in the Western world (1). The combination of
cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) with an anthracycline is the
standard-of-care for patients ﬁt for induction therapy; neverthe-

Effects of Dinaciclib against MLL-Rearranged AML

DOT1L (6–12). In addition, histone deacetylases (HDAC) can
also associate with MLL-FPs (13). It is clear that not all MLL-FPs will
recruit the same epigenetic or transcription-regulatory enzymes and
therefore selective targeting of a speciﬁc enzyme(s) may be required
to effectively treat AML driven by the different fusion proteins. For
example, MLL-EEN and MLL-CBP do not recruit the SEC (12);
however, MLL-EEN does recruit PRMT1 and requires this for
oncogenesis (14).
Small molecules targeting DOT1L (15, 16), BRD4 (8, 17), LSD1
(18, 19), HDACs (20), and CDK9 (21) have been tested for activity
against MLL-FP–driven AML in diverse in vitro and in vivo systems
with varying effect. Herein, we have used sophisticated genetically
engineered mouse models of MLL-AF9 AML and human leukemias
expressing MLL-AF9 and other MLL-FPs to test the sensitivity of
these tumors to a range of agents that target the epigenetic and
transcriptional regulatory proteins recruited by these oncogenic
fusion proteins. Using an in vitro screen, we found that the CDK
inhibitor dinaciclib was consistently the most potent inducer of
apoptosis of the MLL-AF9–driven leukemia cells. This apoptosis
correlated with suppression of CDK9 enzymatic activity and downregulation of previously identiﬁed MLL-AF9 target genes HoxA9
and Meis1, indicating CDK9 as an important mediator of the effect
of dinaciclib. Consistent with prior reports in other malignancies
(22–24), apoptosis induction by dinaciclib correlated with acute
transcriptional downregulation of Mcl-1 and retroviral overexpression of Mcl-1 rescued dinaciclib-induced death of MLL-AF9–driven
AML cells. Importantly, dinaciclib was efﬁcacious in vivo in mice
bearing human and mouse MLL-AF9–driven AMLs and very clearly
outperformed a chemotherapeutic regimen involving a combination of cytarabine and doxorubicin. Our data provide a strong
rationale for the testing of dinaciclib in patients with AML driven by
MLL-AF9 and other MLL-FPs that recruit pTEFb.

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals and materials
Retroviral constructs were previously described (25). C57BL/6
mice were purchased from The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of
Medical Research (Melbourne, Australia) and NOD/SCID, IL2R g
chain-deﬁcient (NSG) were bred in-house. All mice were used in
accordance with the institutional guidelines of Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia). EPZ004777 was supplied
by Epizyme, JQ1 was supplied by Dr. J. Bradner (Dana Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), while panobinostat was provided
by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia, and prepared as a 2 mg/mL
solution in 5% dextrose/dH2O (D5W). Dinaciclib was provided
by Merck and prepared as a 2 mg/mL solution in 20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin solution. Cytarabine, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide were obtained from the Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) and further diluted in PBS
to a 12.5 mg/mL solution. Flavopiridol was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals and prepared in sterile water as a 5 mmol/L
stock, and palbociclib was generously provided by Shatha Abuhammad and Prof. Grant McArthur (Peter MacCallum Cancer
Centre, Melbourne, Australia).
Transduction of fetal liver cells and reconstitution in irradiated
mice
Primary leukemias were generated by the retroviral coexpression of MSCV-MLL-AF9-IRES-VENUS with MSCV-luciferase-IRESNrasG12D or MSCV-luciferase-IRES-Cherry expression constructs

www.aacrjournals.org

as described previously (20). Transduced cells were used to
reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment of each irradiated
6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Mice were then monitored for
disease onset and progression by the analysis of peripheral blood
and bioluminescence imaging.
Isolation of primary murine leukemias
Spleens were harvested from primary leukemic mice at ethical
disease burden. The spleens were then macerated and sifted
through a 0.40-mm ﬁlter, centrifuged, and resuspended in fetal
calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen Life Technologies)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Life Technologies) before cryopreservation. For subsequent in vitro assays, thawed primary MLL-AF9 leukemia cells
were cultured as described previously (20). Retroviral transduction of MLL-AF9 leukemia cells with the murine stem cell virusinternal ribosomal entry site-GFP (MSCV-I-GFP) Mcl-1 construct
was performed as described previously (26).
In vitro dose response assays
Human THP-1, MV4-11, HL60, and Kasumi cell lines were
obtained from the ATCC directly and minimally cultured in
RPMI1640 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) þ 10% FCS while
murine MLL-AF9 leukemias were cultured in a DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Exponentially growing cells were seeded
into 96 well-plates at 150,000 cells/150 mL. Inhibitors were
serially diluted from appropriate starting concentrations. After
24-hour incubation, 50 mg/mL of propidium iodide (PI; Life
Technologies) was added and the cells were analyzed via ﬂow
cytometry.
Patient-derived AMLs were described previously (27). The
mouse bone marrow stromal cell line MS-5 was kindly provided
by Prof. Mori (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan; ref. 28). MS-5
cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 104 cells per well in aMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and
L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), and grown to conﬂuence over 3 to 4
days. Human AML PDX cells (27) were retrieved from cryostorage
and seeded onto the conﬂuent MS-5 monolayer at 5  104 cells
per well in Iscove's modiﬁed Dulbecco's medium containing
0.5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine. The next
day, dinaciclib was added to duplicate wells at concentrations
between 5 nmol/L and 10 mmol/L and plates were incubated for
an additional 24 hours. Cells were then harvested with trypsin and
stained with Annexin V-PE (BD Biosciences), an anti-human
CD45-APC antibody, and 7AAD (BioLegend) according to the
manufacturers' instructions. The stained cells were enumerated on
a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer and analyzed by CellQuest
Pro v6.0 (BD Biosciences). Cells that were human CD45þ/
Annexin V/7AAD were gated as viable leukemia cells. IC50 was
determined by cubic spline regression analysis using GraphPad
Prism 5.0.
Apoptosis assays
For mitochondrial membrane potential assays, cells were incubated for 20 minutes with 50 nmol/L of tetramethylrhodamine
(Abcam) before being resuspended in PBS for ﬂow cytometry
analysis. For the detection of subdiploid DNA content, cells were
analyzed using the Nicoletti method (29). Phosphatidyl serine
exposure was assessed by Annexin V antibody (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) staining in buffer solution (10 mmol/L HEPES
adjusted to pH 7.4, 140 mmol/L NaCl, and 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2) as
described previously (30). For caspase inhibition, cells were

pretreated with 20 mmol/L of Q-VD-OPh as previously described
(31). Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCanto II ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo 7.6.4
software (Tree Star).
Colony assays
Primary murine MLL-AF9 leukemia cells were plated on DNA
grade agar (BD Biosciences) dissolved in DMEM onto non-tissue
culture 6-well plates at 8,000 cells per well. For shRNA-mir
knockdown experiments, cells were FACS-sorted for reporter
expression prior to plating. After three weeks of incubation, viable
colonies were identiﬁed using the MTT assay (32) prior to macrophotography and colony counting using Metamorph analysis
software.
Western blot analysis
Western blot assays were performed as previously described
(20) using antibodies against acetyl-histone H3 (Merck, 06-599),
p-Rpb1 CTD (Ser2/5; Cell Signaling Technology, #4735), b-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich #A2228), Mcl-1 (Rockland Immunochemicals
Inc.), HSP90 (AC88, Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.), and the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase–coupled secondary antibodies (Dako).
All antibodies were used at 1:1,000 and detected with the ECL
reagent by GE Healthcare.
In vivo studies
For murine MLL-AF9 treatment studies, 1  106 primary
leukemia cells isolated from the spleens of terminally diseased
mice were transplanted into 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice via
tail vein injection. Dinaciclib and panobinostat treatment began
7 days posttransplantation via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. For
panobinostat, mice were treated with 25 mg/kg Monday–Friday
(M–F) for the ﬁrst week and then 15 mg/kg M–F thereafter
as described previously (20). For dinaciclib, mice were given
30 mg/kg every third day. To simulate cytosine arabinoside/
anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, mice were treated
every 24 hours with 100 mg/kg of cytarabine from days 1 to 5 and
3 mg/kg of doxorubicin from days 1 to 3.
MV4-11 cells were transduced with MSCV-luciferase-IRESCherry vector and cherry-positive cells were sorted by ﬂow cytometry and xenografted by tail vein injection into NSG mice two
days after preconditioning with 5 daily doses of 150 mg/kg
cyclophosphamide. Dinaciclib, 30 mg/kg, was administered every
third day from day 7 posttransplant.
Treated mice were monitored by peripheral blood analysis and
in vivo imaging using the IVIS100 bioluminescence imaging
system (Perkin Elmer) as described previously (20).
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Life Technologies)
or NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit, (Macherey-Nagel) according to
manufacturer's instructions and cDNA was synthesized using
TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis was performed using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) on an iCycler mounted with an iQ5 Multicolor RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Signals were quantiﬁed
using the DDCt method and normalized to L32 levels. Primer

Statistical analysis
Appropriate results were expressed in graphs with means 

same source were determined using one-way ANOVA and twosample paired and nonpaired t tests were used to determine
differences between groups. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05. All statistics were performed on GraphPad Prism 6.01
with a at P < 0.05 for statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
Panobinostat and dinaciclib induce death of MLL-AF9 tumor
cells in vitro
We previously developed a preclinical murine model of MLLAF9–driven AML using retroviral vectors expressing MLL-AF9
linked to a GFP construct, and a luciferase reporter gene that is
coexpressed with NRASG12D or the ﬂuorescent cherry protein
(25). Previous studies have shown that these leukemias were
relatively insensitive to conventional chemotherapeutics (25) and
we therefore sought to identify therapeutic agents that would
effectively kill MLL-AF9–driven AMLs. Three independently
derived primary AMLs expressing MLL-AF9 with (MLL-AF9;
NRASG12D) and without (MLL-AF9;cherry) coexpression
of oncogenic RAS were subsequently used to test the cell
death–inducing activity of small molecules targeting HDACs
(panobinostat), CDK9 (dinaciclib), DOT1L (EPZ4777), and BET
bromodomian proteins (JQ1), or the chemotherapeutic agents
cytosine arabinoside and etoposide in a 24-hour assay. JQ1,
EPZ4777, and etoposide had minimal effect on the short-term
viability of all leukemias studied, while panobinostat and cytosine arabinoside were effective against certain leukemias and only
at relatively high concentrations in the majority (Fig. 1). The most
potent cell death responses were observed using dinaciclib, with
this agent consistently inducing death of all six independently
derived murine MLL-AF9 leukemias using the 24-hour assay (Fig.
1). Combination studies using dinaciclib and the two agents that
demonstrated weaker antileukemic effects (panobinostat and
cytosine arabinoside) did not reveal additive or synergistic activities between the agents. In fact, both panobinostat and cytosine

arabinoside (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) antagonized the
apoptotic effects of dinaciclib.
We next tested our panel of agents for activity against primary
murine leukemia expressing MLL-ENL and NRASG12D (MLLENL;NRASG12D) and against human AML cell lines expressing
MLL-AF9 (THP-1) and MLL-AF4 (MV4-11) fusion proteins (Fig.
2A). In all instances, dinaciclib was the most potent deathinducing agent in a 24-hour cell death assay, indicating that
CDK inhibition effectively kills tumors driven by different MLL
fusion proteins. Interestingly, AML cell lines (Kasumi-1 and
HL60) that do not express MLL-FPs were less sensitive to
dinaciclib than THP-1 or MV4-11 cells (Fig. 2A). The sensitivity
of MLL-rearranged leukemias to dinaciclib was further demon-

strated using patient-derived AMLs (Fig. 2B). Dinaciclib
reduced the viability of primary leukemias cultured ex vivo,
with AMLs expressing MLL fusion proteins (AML-17 and AML18) being particularly sensitive.
To conﬁrm apoptotic cell death following treatment with dinaciclib, we demonstrated phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
in dinaciclib- and panobinostat-treated MLL-AF9;NRASG12D cells
(Fig. 2C). Also consistent with apoptotic cell death, the pan-caspase
inhibitor QVD-OPh rescued cell viability following dinaciclib
exposure (Fig. 2D). Finally, both dinaciclib and panobinostat
reduced the colony-forming potential of MLL-AF9;NRASG12D cells
in a dose-dependent manner, with dinaciclib again being the more

on the survival of MLL-AF9;NRASG12D cells, we tested the effect of
ﬂavopiridol, a small-molecule inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and
12 (33, 34) and the more selective CDK 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib
(35). As shown in Fig. 2F, ﬂavopiridol was less potent than
dinaciclib at equimolar concentrations while palbociclib had no
effect on the survival of MLL-AF9;NRASG12D leukemias. Similar
responses were observed when MLL-AF9–expressing THP-1 cells
were exposed to dinaciclib, ﬂavopiridol, and palbociclib (Fig. 2G).
These cells were more sensitive to dinaciclib than ﬂavopiridol while
palbociclib did not induce apoptosis but did mediate cell-cycle
arrest at the G1–S checkpoint (Fig. 2G).

Dinaciclib inhibits the activity of CDK9, reduces expression of
MLL-FP target genes, and induces apoptosis through
downregulation of Mcl-1
As dinaciclib was identiﬁed as the most potent apoptosisinducing agent against MLL-driven leukemias, we sought to link
this biologic response with the kinase-inhibitory activity of this
agent. Dinaciclib potently inhibits CDK9 and phosphorylation of
the RNA polymerase II CTD at Ser2 may be used as a biomarker of
CDK9 activity (36). As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of MLL-AF9;
NRASG12D cells with dinaciclib resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in phospho-RNA Pol II. To demonstrate that dinaciclib
downregulates MLL-AF9 target genes, qRT-PCR analysis was

performed to assess the expression of Meis1 and Hoxa9. Dinaciclib treatment of MLL-AF9;NRASG12D cells resulted in robust
decrease in the expression of these MLL-AF9 targets following
exposure for as little as 6 hours (Fig. 3B). To conﬁrm that CDK9
was essential for the growth and survival of MLL-driven AML,
we developed retroviral vectors expressing a GFP reporter gene
and shRNAs targeting human CDK9. Transduction of THP-1
cells with retrovirus expressing a control (scrambled) shRNA
had no effect on CDK9 mRNA expression or phosphorylation
of RNA Pol II (Fig. 3C). Importantly, knockdown of CDK9
using two different shRNAs reduced RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and completely suppressed the colonyforming capacity of THP-1 cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these

data indicate that pharmacologic inhibition or genetic depletion of CDK9 has a detrimental effect on the growth and
survival of AML cells expressing MLL-FPs.
Expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 can
be regulated by CDKs (37) and we have recently demonstrated
that dinaciclib causes downregulation of Mcl-1 in primary mouse
B-cell lymphomas (23). As shown in Fig. 3E, treatment of MLLAF9;NRASG12D cells with dinaciclib for 3 hours resulted in a
signiﬁcant decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA levels but no change in the
related prosurvival gene Bcl-2. The dinaciclib-induced decrease in
Mcl-1 levels resulted in decreased expression of the Mcl-1 protein
concomitant with dinaciclib-mediated dephosphorylation of the
RNA Pol II CTD (Fig. 3E). To demonstrate the functional

importance of dinaciclib-induced downregulation of Mcl-1, we
used retroviral transduction to overexpress the protein in MLLAF9;NRASG12D cells and observed the derived MLL-AF9;
NRASG12D;Mcl-1 cells to be protected from dinaciclib-induced
apoptosis over a range of different drug concentrations (Fig. 3F).
Taken together, these experiments indicate that the decrease in
Mcl-1 expression following exposure to dinaciclib is important for
the apoptotic effects of the compound.
Dinaciclib induces apoptosis of MLL-AF9–driven leukemia cells
in vivo, resulting in a reduction in tumor burden and therapeutic
efﬁcacy
C57/BL6 mice were transplanted with MLL-AF9;NRASG12D
tumors and following tumor establishment, cells were harvested
at various times following dinaciclib treatment. Treatment of
tumor-bearing mice for a little as 30 minutes resulted in an
increase in apoptosis of MLL-AF9;NRASG12D tumors residing in
the spleens of these animals as measured using Annexin V/PI
staining and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4A). Dinaciclib-mediated
in vivo apoptosis occurred concomitantly with a reduction of
phospho-RNA Pol II (Fig. 4B) providing a direct correlation
between on-target molecular activity of the compound and antitumor biologic responses.
To determine the therapeutic potential of dinaciclib, C57BL/6
mice bearing established MLL-AF9;NRASG12D tumors were treated
with vehicle or the compound at the maximum tolerated dose.
Treatment with dinaciclib resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
tumor burden as measured by a decrease in white blood cell
counts and a reduction in bioluminescence (Fig. 5A). Treatment
of tumor-bearing mice with dinaciclib resulted in an overall
survival beneﬁt, with median survival times of 37 days in the
Dinaciclib-treated cohort compared with 19 days for the vehicletreated mice (Fig. 5A, P  0.0001). The therapeutic effects of
dinaciclib were greater than observed when mice bearing established MLL-AF9;NRASG12D tumors were treated with panobinostat or a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cytarabine and
doxorubicin at the MTD (Fig. 5B and C). Treatment with panobinostat resulted in a median survival time of 19 days compared
with the control cohort that had a median survival of 15 days. The
chemotherapy regimen resulted in a median survival time of 20
days compared with 16 days for vehicle-treated mice. These results

conﬁrm the potent antitumor effects of dinaciclib and demonstrate a direct correlation between the potency of the compound in
vitro with in vivo therapeutic effects.
To further demonstrate the therapeutic effects of dinaciclib
against MLL-AF9–driven AML in the absence of an engineered
Ras mutation, mice bearing established MLL-AF9;cherry leukemias
were treated with dinaciclib or vehicle and the effects in vivo were
monitored. Similar to the effects shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with
dinaciclib signiﬁcantly decreased leucocytosis and reduced tumor
burden as demonstrated by decreased bioluminescence (Fig. 6A).
Treatment with dinaciclib resulted in a signiﬁcant prolongation of
the survival of mice transplanted with MLL-AF9;cherry tumors
(Fig. 6A, median survival of dinaciclib-treated mice ¼ 86 days;
median survival of vehicle-treated mice ¼ 60 days, P  0.0002). In
contrast, the antitumor effects of panobinostat (Fig. 6B, median
survival of panobinostat-treated mice ¼ 62 days; median survival
of vehicle-treated mice ¼ 53 days) and chemotherapy (Fig. 6C,
median survival of chemotherapy-treated mice ¼ 71 days; median
survival of vehicle-treated mice ¼ 56 days) were markedly less
robust than that observed with dinaciclib.
Therapeutic effects of dinaciclib against human MLL-fusion
protein–driven AML tumors
The encouraging results using dinaciclib to treat mice bearing
primary mouse MLL-AF9–driven tumors prompted us to further
study the potential therapeutic efﬁcacy of dinaciclib in a human
MLL-translocated leukemia in vivo. Mice with established disseminated MV4-11;MSCV-Luciferase tumors were treated with dinaciclib or vehicle and tumor progression and overall survival of the
treated mice were assessed. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment with
dinaciclib resulted in a substantial decrease in white blood cell
counts that corresponded with a signiﬁcant survival advantage.
Treatment with dinaciclib resulted in a median survival time of
52 days compared with the vehicle-treated control cohort that had
a median survival of 33 days.

Discussion
MLL-FP–driven AML is associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapy and poor prognosis (38). A key oncogenic
feature of MLL-FPs such as MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL is their

recruitment of large macromolecular complexes that mediate
chromatin remodeling and regulate gene transcription initiation
and elongation (6–10). Herein, we utilized primary mouse AMLs
driven by MLL-AF9 or MLL-ENL and human AML cell lines
harboring MLL-FPs to assess the apoptotic and therapeutic effects
of small molecules that inhibit key epigenetic and transcriptional
regulatory enzymes recruited by these oncogenic fusion proteins.
Our initial screen using mouse AMLs driven by MLL-AF9 that were
relatively chemorefractory indicated that dinaciclib, an inhibitor
of CDKs 1, 2, 5, and 9, was the most potent inducer of apoptosis in
a 24-hour assay. Interestingly, inhibition of DOT1L using
EPZ004777 or BET bromodomain proteins with JQ1 did not
induce apoptosis during the time course of our assays. Previous
studies indicated that in vitro antitumor effects of EPZ004777 or
JQ1 in similar models of MLL-AF9–driven AML are evident, albeit
with slower kinetics than described herein (16, 17, 39).
Relatively selective killing of MLL-FP–driven AML by dinaciclib
was demonstrated by comparing the effects against human AML
cell lines harboring different oncogenic lesions. AMLs expressing
MLL-AF9 (THP-1) and MLL-AF4 (MV4-11) fusion proteins were
more sensitive than those expressing AML1-ETO (Kasumi) or with
a complex karyotype including mutations in TP53, NRAS, and
CDKN2A (HL60). This provides some evidence supporting the
notion that the leukemias driven by MLL-FPs that recruit the
CDK9-containing SECs are preferentially sensitive to CDK9 inhibition compared with other tumors where transcriptional elongation may not be as molecularly important. A recent functional

www.aacrjournals.org

genomics–based screen using gene knockdown technologies
demonstrated that inhibition of CDK9 may be an effective therapeutic approach for Myc-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC;
ref. 40). Myc-regulated transcriptional elongation is mediated by
the CDK9-containing pTEFb complex (41–44) and the anti-HCC
effects observed following knockdown of CDK9 were phenocopied by knockdown of c-Myc (40). Consistent with the notion that
targeting CDK9 is an effective strategy for the treatment of Mycdriven malignancies, we very recently demonstrated curative
responses in dinaciclib-treated mice bearing Myc-driven B-cell
lymphomas (23). Interestingly c-Myc expression is important for
the maintenance of MLL-AF9–driven AML (8, 17, 45) and it is
possible that dinaciclib-mediated inhibition of CDK9 had such a
potent effect in our AML models because CDK9 is important for
the oncogenic activity of both MLL-AF9 and c-Myc.
In addition to its crucial role in phosphorylating the CTD of
RNA Pol II and regulating gene expression, CDK9 also functionally interacts with other cellular proteins including MyoD, p53,
pRb, and c-Myc and can affect diverse biologic processes including
cell differentiation, survival, and quiescence (46). Herein, we
demonstrated that inhibition of CDK9 enzymatic activity resulted
in rapid dephosphorylation of RNA Pol II and induction of
apoptosis in AML cells and we identiﬁed Mcl-1 as a gene crucial
for this response. Proteins with relatively short half-lives such as
Mcl-1 appear to be selectively reduced following CDK9 inhibition
(23, 47–49). Dinaciclib treatment resulted in almost complete
loss of Mcl-1 expression within 3 hours demonstrating that this

elegant genetic studies shown the essential role of Mcl-1 in the
development and maintenance of MLL-FP–driven AML (50). We
demonstrated that downregulation of Mcl-1 by dinaciclib was
functionally important as ectopic overexpression of Mcl-1 rescued
tumor cells from dinaciclib-induced apoptosis. On the basis of
these studies, we posit that downregulation of Mcl-1 could serve

(left) and overall survival (right). Dinaciclib-treated tumor-bearing mice had signiﬁcantly fewer white blood cell numbers (day 14; P ¼ 0.0004) and a Kaplan–Meier
survival curve showed a signiﬁcant difference (P ¼ 0.0006) in median survival for vehicle-treated mice (33 days) compared with dinaciclib-treated mice (52 days).

Effects of Dinaciclib against MLL-Rearranged AML

(52) and was recently shown to bind to members of BET family of
bromodomain-containing proteins, albeit in the higher micromolar range (53). Our data demonstrating that the antitumor
effects of dinaciclib occurred concomitantly with inhibition
of CDK9 activity as shown by reduced phosphorylation of
RNA Pol II and that knockdown of CDK9 phenocopied the
biologic (loss of AML clonogenic growth) and molecular
(RNA Pol II dephosphorylation) effects of dinaciclib provide
evidence that inhibition of CDK9 has important antileukemic
consequences. Indeed, other agents capable of inhibiting CDK9
can also kill human AML cell lines and primary human leukemias
in vitro (54–57). Comparison of the effects of dinaciclib with the
broad CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol and the more selective CDK 4/6
palbociclib revealed that ﬂavopiridol also induced rapid apoptosis of MLL-AF9–driven AML cells, albeit at higher concentrations
than dinaciclib, while palbociclib had no effect on cell survival.
These data indicate that inhibition of CDK4 and/or CDK6 is
not sufﬁcient to phenocopy the effects of dinaciclib and provides further evidence supporting the role of CDK9 inhibition
in mediating antileukemic apoptotic effects. Previous studies
demonstrated that knockdown of CDK6 or inhibition of enzymatic activity resulted in delayed cell proliferation and induction of myeloid differentiation (58) as opposed to the apoptotic effects we observe using dinaciclib or ﬂavopiridol. Collectively, these studies indicate that different CDKs likely play
disparate roles in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and
survival of MLL-rearranged AML.
Our in vivo data demonstrating the efﬁcacy of dinaciclib in mice
bearing disseminated syngeneic or xenogeneic MLL-FP–driven
AML in the absence of overt toxicity provides preclinical evidence
that targeting CDK9 in humans with AML should be considered
for further evaluation. The antitumor effects using dinaciclib to
treat mice bearing murine MLL-AF9 AML were signiﬁcantly greater
than the responses we observed using panobinostat or a chemotherapeutic regimen. These preclinical ﬁndings highlight the
potential therapeutic value of dinaciclib for patients with AML
harboring MLL translocations. Dinaciclib has already been shown
to be deliverable in humans and initial clinical trials in patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (59), multiple myeloma (60),
and solid tumors (61) have demonstrated the therapeutic effects
of dinaciclib in those settings. A recent phase II study of dinaciclib
including 14 patients with relapsed/refractory AML demonstrated
dramatic reductions in blast counts in the majority of patients,
associated with biochemical tumor lysis syndrome and acute
reductions in Mcl-1 (62). However, formal remissions were not
demonstrated due to pharmacokinetic limitations in heavily
disease-burdened patients and the cohort was not enriched for
MLL-translocated disease. Our studies provide evidence support-

ing the extended clinical utilization of dinaciclib in AML, especially in the context of MLL-FP–driven disease.
