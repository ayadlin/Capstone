BACKGROUND. It has been recognized that cure is possible for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL) if
appropriate chemotherapy is used. The introduction of rituximab in BL therapeutic schemes has been scarcely explored. The outcome and toxicity of HIV-positive
patients with BL treated in a rituximab and intensive chemotherapy-based trial
was evaluated.

METHODS. Thirty-six consecutive patients, 15 to 55 years of age, diagnosed with
advanced stage BL were recruited from July 2003 to August 2006, stratified
according to HIV infection status and treated with 6 cycles of intensive chemoPhD

patients having a risk of developing these lymphomas that is 200- to 1000-fold higher than that of the
general population.3 In recent years it has been
increasingly recognized that cure is also possible in
this population if appropriate intensive multiagent
chemotherapy is used,4–8 particularly for patients
with a preserved immune status who respond to
highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART).9
Improvement in immune function has led to an
improved tolerance to full-dose chemotherapy for
HIV-associated lymphoma, including BL, in which
recent studies have shown similar outcomes for HIVinfected and noninfected patients when treated with
the same chemotherapeutic protocols. Because of
the intense CD20 expression in Burkitt cells, the
introduction of rituximab in BL therapeutic schemes
may be an interesting alternative to explore in these
patients. However, some studies have raised concern
about an increased risk of infections for HIV-positive
patients treated with chemotherapy and rituximab.10
At the PETHEMA (Programa Español de Tratamiento
en Hematologı́a) cooperative group, we routinely
treat patients with BL with chemotherapy regimens
irrespective of HIV status.9 To evaluate the feasibility
of including HIV-positive patients in our current protocol, based on rituximab and intensive chemotherapy for BL, we prospectively compared toxicities and
outcome of the first set of consecutive HIV-positive
and negative adult patients with BL included in the
trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility and Diagnostic Criteria
The PETHEMA Group adopted the study B-ALL/
NHL2002 from the GMALL (German Multicenter
Study Group for the Treatment of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) protocol11,12 that combined
Burkitt-specific short intensive cycles of chemotherapy and rituximab and began accrual in July 2003 for
HIV-negative patients and in September 2004 for
HIV-positive individuals. To assess the feasibility of
including HIV-positive patients in the protocol, an
early interim analysis of consecutive patients, 15 to
55 years of age, diagnosed with advanced stage BL
(bulky stage II and stages III and IV) or L3ALL enrolled up to August 2006 was planned. There was no
restriction by performance status, or organ dysfunction if it was because of BL or L3ALL, and patients
were stratified according to HIV status only. To be
eligible, HIV-infected patients had to be under or
had to begin HAART. Appropriate ethical approval
was obtained for each center, informed consent was

obtained from all patients, and the trial adhered to
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients were registered after diagnosis of BL by
local pathologists according to REAL/WHO13 criteria.
A mature B-cell immunophenotype was defined as
reactivity to B-cell antigens (CD10, CD19, CD20,
CD22, CD24 in cell suspensions or frozen tissue, or
CD20 and CD79a in fixed tissue) and monoclonality
of surface immunoglobulins. Cytogenetic study of
bone marrow, peripheral blood or lymph node, or tumor mass was performed in institutional laboratories
using direct methods and unstimulated short-term
(24 and 48 hours) cultures with G-banding, following
the International System for Human Cytogenetics14
guidelines. Leukemic disease was considered if >20%
atypical bone marrow cells were present. Central
nervous system disease was defined as the presence
of blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cranial
nerve palsy not related to a facial tumor, clinical
signs of spinal cord compression, or an intracranial
mass. Tissue slides were stained by hematoxylin/eosin and Giemsa techniques, and the Ki-67 proliferation antigen was used. Immunophenotypic and
cytogenetic studies were performed in both cytological samples and/or fixed tissue whenever possible.
To be as inclusive as possible and to avoid selection
biases associated with diagnostic restrictions, a diagnosis of BL was accepted when characteristic morphology was present together with >90% nuclear
labeling on Ki-67 stained slides in any tissue or cytologic sample.

Parameters Evaluated
Baseline parameters included physical examination
with assessment of WHO performance status, a complete blood cell count, coagulation and biochemical
profiles including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
urate levels, computed tomography scanning of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis including measurement
of tumor diameters, bone marrow aspirate, or trephine biopsy, and a diagnostic lumbar puncture performed with a first instillation of triple intrathecal
therapy. Bulky disease was defined by a single
tumoral mass larger than 10 cm at its largest diameter. Assessment of left ventricular cardiac function
was recommended before the onset of therapy.
Sequential evaluations included complete blood
counts, liver and renal function studies, and coagulation profiles. CD4 lymphocyte counts (by flow cytometry) and HIV viral load counts (Nuclisens HIV-1QT,
Organon Teknica, Doxtel, The Netherlands) were
obtained from HIV-positive patients.
A complete assessment was performed to determine complete remission (CR) achievement after 2

of 6 cycles plus 2 additional rituximab doses. After
completion of therapy, patients in CR were assessed
every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months
during the second year, and annually thereafter.

Chemotherapy Regimen
The chemotherapy schedule is summarized in Table
1. Briefly, a prephase treatment with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 intravenously (iv) over 1 hour and
prednisone 60 mg/m2 i.v. every 24 hours for 5 doses
on Days 1–5 was given to prevent the tumor lysis
syndrome. Afterward, 3 different courses (A,B,C) of
intensive chemotherapy were given at 4-week intervals and repeated up to 6 total cycles. All cycles
began with a standard dose of rituximab followed by
methotrexate 1500 mg/m2 in a 24-hour infusion the
next day and 5 doses of dexamethasone on Days 1 to

5. In addition, A-cycles (cycles 1 and 4) included vincristine, iphosphamide, teniposide, and standard
dose cytarabine. B-cycles (cycles 2 and 5) included
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin and
C-cycles (cycles 3 and 6) included vindesine, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine. Two additional doses
of rituximab were administered 3 and 6 weeks after
the last C cycle up to 8 doses for the complete treatment. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis
included 8 doses of intrathecal administration of
methotrexate, cytarabine, and dexamethasone in
cycles A and B (2 doses per cycle). During induction
the first dose of intrathecal treatment was administered on Day 1 of prephase treatment. Patients with
documented CNS involvement received intrathecal
chemotherapy twice weekly during induction until
the CSF cell count was normalized and the cytological examination was negative and then followed the
prophylactic scheme described above.

Supportive Care and Complementary Treatment
During the prephase and first treatment course, allopurinol was given together with intravenous hydration and alkalinization to reduce the complications
of tumor lysis. Afterward, only hydration (3000 mL/
m2 day) and alkalinization (40 mmol of sodium bicarbonate per liter of hydration) were mandatory.
Calcium leucovorin was given at a dose of 75 mg/m2
i.v. 12 hours after the completion of methotrexate, a
second dose of 30 mg/m2 i.v. was given 3 hours later
and continued at a dose of 10 mg/m2 i.v. every 6
hours until methotrexate blood levels were less than
0.2 mm/L. Afterward, oral calcium leucovorin was
given orally for 2 additional doses. Standard doses of
methotrexate were reduced to 0.5 g/m2 for patients
with serum creatinine >2 mg/dL or serum total bilirubin >2 mg/dL, being raised according to tolerance
in subsequent cycles. From the second and subsequent cycles, an absolute granulocyte count of
>1 3 109/L without growth factor support and an
unsupported platelet count of >75 3 109/L were
required to begin the cycle. G-CSF administration (5
mg/kg/day subcutaneously) was administered in each
cycle if severe neutropenia was present in the previous cycle to maintain the intervals between cycles.
No dose reductions were recommended based on the
degree or duration of myelosuppression at the previous cycle, but 25% to 50% reductions of methotrexate, cytarabine, and vincristine doses were allowed
with the presence of severe mucositis, hepatotoxicity,
or severe sensory symptoms in prior cycles.
Hospitalization, prophylaxis, and management of
infections and transfusion policy were not prescribed
by the protocol and were performed according to the
specific protocols of each participating hospital.
HAART (at least 1 or 2 protease inhibitors and 2
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors)15 was
mandatory for all HIV-infected patients. Patients who
were not under antiretroviral therapy before diagnosis of BL started HAART during the first chemotherapy course and continued after the end of therapy.
Prophylaxis against HIV-specific opportunistic infections was not recommended while on chemotherapy
except Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis for patients
without immunological response to HAART at baseline. Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis during
neutropenia was performed according to institutional
protocols of participating centers.
Response Criteria and Toxicity Evaluation
Intermediate evaluations of response status were performed after 2 and 4 treatment cycles and final evaluations were performed 1 month after completion
of therapy and every 3 months thereafter during the

first year. CR was defined as 5% blasts in a normocellular marrow associated with hemoperipheral recovery and complete resolution of extramedullary
disease as assessed by clinical examination, imaging
studies, and CSF cytology. The ‘unconfirmed CR’
category according to standard criteria was accepted
only at the first evaluation (after 2 cycles of treatment) but not in evaluations after treatment completion. Partial remission (PR) suggested a >50%
reduction in the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. Progressive disease (PD) suggested a >25% increase in the
size of lesions as defined for PR. Both PR and PD
were considered treatment failures if present in the
evaluations after treatment completion. Induction
death was defined as death within 8 weeks of the
initiation of therapy (within the 2 cycles before first
response assessment). Treatment failure was considered when a patient survived the induction treatment
but did not achieve PR after 2 treatment cycles or a
CR after 4, and relapse was defined as disease recurrence at any site after at least 2 months of documented CR.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
first day of chemotherapy to death due to any cause
or to the date of the last follow-up contact for
patients who were alive (May 2007). Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated for patients having
achieved CR from the day of documented CR to
death due to any cause, relapse, or to the date of the
last follow-up contact for patients who did not experience any event. Differences in time-to-event (ie, OS
and DFS) among HIV-infected and noninfected
patients were expressed as odd ratios (ORs). In HIVinfected patients, virological response to HAART was
defined as having total HIV RNA loads below the
limit of detection in serum (<80 copies/mL) and
immunological response as having CD4-positive lymphocyte counts >250/mL (>0.25 3 109/L). Toxicity
was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute
(NCI) criteria (v. 3.0).

Statistical Methods
Similar numbers of HIV-infected and noninfected
patients were expected. Infectious toxicity and feasibility of the complete planned treatment were the
main variables under study. CR, DFS, and OS rates
were considered important secondary endpoints.
Most HIV-positive patients were expected to be in an
advanced stage and expected to be younger than 60
years of age. As stage and age are considered important prognostic factors and dose or cycle reductions
were considered in the protocol for patients with
advanced age or localized disease, only patients with

Rituximab in HIV-related Burkitt Lymphoma/Oriol et al.

advanced stage younger than 55 years old were
included for comparison to allow a fair comparison
between groups. Therefore, HIV status was the only
stratification variable for analysis. Exploratory analyses of a limited number of other potential prognostic
factors were carried out for association with CR and
survival, including age, sex, performance status,
bulky disease, leukemic disease, Ann Arbor stage,
CNS involvement, LDH, and albumin. The association between the initial characteristics and comparisons among strata were explored by means of the w2
test, Fisher exact test, or the Student t-test. Prognostic factors associated with CR were calculated using
the w2 test and ORs and the 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. OS and DFS curves were plotted according to the
Kaplan-Meier method.16 The log-rank test17 was used
for univariate analyses and the Cox proportional
hazard ratio model for multivariate analyses.18

RESULTS
Patients
Accrual for HIV-negative patients started in July 2003
and in September 2004 for HIV-positive individuals.
Up to August 2006, 44 patients were registered at 10
centers. Thirty-six patients (82%) were aged 18 to 55
years and were diagnosed with advanced stage disease and therefore formed the selected group for
analysis. Twenty-nine were males (81%), with a median age of 39 years (range, 15–55). Seven patients
(19%) had bulky Ann Arbor stage II and 6 (17%) stage
III. Among the remaining patients, 15 (42%) had
morphologically evident bone marrow involvement,
10 of whom (28%) fulfilled L3ALL criteria and 8 presented stage IV lymphoma without bone marrow
involvement. Two patients with L3ALL and 2 with BL
had CNS involvement at diagnosis (11%); abdominal
masses were present in 21 (58%) and involved the
gastrointestinal tract in 19 cases (53%). Hepatic and
splenic involvement were demonstrated in 8 and 2
cases, respectively. Other extranodal sites involved
included the kidneys (5 cases), lung (5), the oral cavity (1), thyroid gland (1), and skeletal muscle (1).
Four patients had active infection at the time of diagnosis and 4 presented with mild to moderate renal
insufficiency. Twenty-six patients (72%) had an evaluable cytogenetic analysis; typical Burkitt karyotypes
t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(8;22)(q24;q11) were present as
the only abnormality in 16 and 1 patients, respectively; 4 of them had complex additional chromosomal abnormalities and 5 had normal diploid
karyotypes and an undetermined partner of a rearranged c-myc.

Nineteen (53%) of the patients were HIVinfected. Their clinical characteristics were comparable to those of the HIV-negative patients and are
summarized in Table 2. Seventeen patients had been
diagnosed with HIV infection 1 to 17 years before diagnosis of lymphoma (median, 8 years) and 12 had
received HAART for a median of 5 years (range, 1–
12). Five other patients not receiving HAART at diagnosis because of adequate CD4-positive lymphocyte
counts (4 cases) or abandonment of treatment (1
case) and 2 patients diagnosed with HIV infection at
the time of diagnosis of BL began or restarted
HAART treatment during the first course of chemotherapy. Nine patients had had prior AIDS-defining
conditions (Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, 2
patients; oral or esophagic candidemia, 2; tuberculosis, 3; or disseminated herpetic lesions, 2). Eleven
(58%) patients were in immunological response or
had an adequate CD4 count (over 200/mL) and 8
patients (42%) were in complete virological response
at diagnosis.

Response to Induction Treatment
Among the 17 HIV-negative patients treated, 15
achieved CR (88%), 1 died during early induction
treatment (cycle A) and 1 because of the first B cycle
toxicity. Sixteen of the 19 HIV-positive patients (84%)
achieved CR, 3 died early during induction (cycle A).
Major infection was involved in 4 early deaths (1
case each of Geotrichum capitatum sepsis, Scedosporium prolificans sepsis, and bilateral pneumonia

due to an unknown agent in HIV-positive patients
and 1 case of Candida glabrata pneumonia in an
HIV-negative individual). The remaining patient
(HIV-negative) developed multiple organ failure
attributed to direct toxicity of treatment after receiving the second treatment cycle, although no single
chemotherapeutic agent could be identified as the
causal drug. The overall CR rate of the series was
86%. The differences in induction-related mortality
or in CR rates between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients were not statistically significant. None
of the initial characteristics evaluated could be identified as prognostic for CR achievement or early
death.

Consolidation Treatment
Four of the patients who achieved CR (3 HIV-positive) did not complete the 6 planned cycles. One
patient (HIV-negative) relapsed while on therapy
(after the third treatment cycle, after 1.8 months of
CR). In the other 3 cases (all HIV-positive), toxicity
led to permanent interruption of treatment (1 case)
or death (2 fatal pneumonias due to Aspergillus fumigatus in 1 case and to an unknown agent in the
other). In all 3 cases excessive toxicity appeared after
the first C cycle. Twenty-seven patients (75%) completed the 6 protocol scheduled cycles. The proportion of HIV-infected patients who completed the
treatment plan was lower (68% vs 82%), albeit not
statistically different than that from HIV-negative
individuals.

(B) in individual cycles according to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status.

Treatment-related Toxicity and Morbidity
The prephase was well tolerated, with only 1 case of
reversible tumor lysis syndrome being reported. Figure 1 summarizes the main adverse events of the 176
cycles of high-dose treatment in which toxicity was
evaluated. Myelosuppression was universal and grade
4 neutropenia was expected in most cycles. The duration of cytopenia was similar for all cycles with a
global median time to recovery of neutrophils of
0.5 3 109/L at 7 days (range, 0-24 days) and platelets of 20 3 109/L at 5 days (range, 0-31 days). No
statistically significant differences in the duration of
neutropenia or delays in following treatment cycles
were observed between HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients. One HIV-positive patient permanently
discontinued treatment after the first C cycle because
of severe pancytopenia persisting more than 2 months.
More HIV-infected individuals developed severe
mucositis and septic side effects than HIV-negative
individuals. The overall incidence of grade 3-4 mucositis was 17% (30 of 176 cycles), 27% for HIVinfected, and 7% for HIV-negative patients (P 5 .0005).

The incidence of mucositis ranged from 4% (cycles
B2 and C2) to 36% (cycle A1) and, thus, was more
frequent after the first 3 cycles than later on for both
HIV-positive and -negative individuals (Fig. 1A). The
overall incidence of severe infectious episodes (grade
3–5) was 17%, with statistically significant differences
between HIV-negative and -positive individuals (7 of
86 cycles, 8% vs 23 of 90 cycles, 26%, P 5 .0025). The
overall incidence of septic episodes was also more
frequent after the first induction cycle (39%) and
decreased thereafter (<20% in any other cycle, Fig.
1B). Other toxicities were less frequent (2 episodes of
grade 3 nephrotoxicity during induction cycles and 1
episode of grade 3 neurotoxicity after a C1 cycle).
Mild neurotoxicity related to either vincristine or to
intrathecal treatment was frequent. No significant
differences in frequency or intensity were observed
according to HIV status.
No AIDS-characteristic opportunistic infections
were observed in HIV-infected individuals during

poor clinical outcomes21 to more Burkitt-oriented
short, intensive multiagent chemotherapy including
fractionated cyclophosphamide, high-dose methotrexate, and cytarabine.5-8 The widespread use of
HAART has broken much of the reluctance to pursue
intensive regimens in AIDS-related BL. The policy of
the PETHEMA cooperative group is to administer
chemotherapy for BL irrespective of HIV status. Consequently, this protocol was able to achieve an acceptable cure rate with Burkitt-oriented treatment
strategies in individuals with HIV infection, with a
67% proportion of durable responses similar to that
obtained for HIV-negative individuals,4 particularly
in patients responding to HAART.9
The intense expression of CD20 in Burkitt cells
provides a strong rationale for the addition of rituximab to Burkitt-oriented chemotherapies. Rituximab
also has a proven anti-BL effect in vitro.22 At least 1
prospective and randomized clinical trial in AIDSrelated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has warned of
a probable increase in major infectious toxicity in
patients treated with rituximab10; however, such excessive toxicity appears to be limited to the most
severely immunosuppressed set of patients. Such excessive infectious risk was not detected in other studies.23 Some groups have introduced rituximab to
their prior AIDS-related BL protocols6 without unexpected infectious toxicities, although the series are
short and the analyses are mostly retrospective. The
present study was designed to prospectively evaluate
the adequacy of treating HIV-positive individuals in
the currently ongoing B-ALL/NHL2002 protocol from

advanced stage and up to 55 years. We expected that

Survival
The 27 patients who completed all the scheduled
cycles and the patient who abandoned treatment after 3 cycles because of toxicity remained in first CR
at the time of the last contact, after a median followup of 1.8 years (range, 0.8-4 years). The 2-year OS
probability was 77% (95% CI, 64%–90%) for the overall series. The OS of HIV-negative (82% at 2 years;
95% CI, 65%–99%) and HIV-positive (73% at 2 years;
95% CI, 54%–92%) patients did not significantly differ (Fig. 2). The OR of HIV-positive patients was 1.56
(95% CI, 0.37-6.53) None of the variables initially
evaluated (including stage, bulky disease, leukemic
disease, and CNS involvement) was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of death.
The 2-year DFS for the 31 patients achieving CR was
90% (95% CI, 81%–99%). DFS did not differ between
HIV-negative (93% at 2 years; 95% CI, 82%–99%) and
HIV-positive (87% at 2 years; 95% CI, 72%–99%)
patients (Fig. 3). The OR of HIV-positive patients was
2.0 (95% CI, 0.18–22.22). None of the other initial
characteristics tested were significantly associated
with an increased risk of relapse or death.

DISCUSSION
BL accounts for 35% to 40% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases in HIV-infected individuals.1,19,20

the HIV-infected cohort would include younger
patients in a more advanced stage and these would
have been an important confounding factor, as age
proved to be the main factor associated with a worse
outcome in our previous protocol.4 Moreover, in the
present protocol cycle reductions were contemplated
for patients with localized disease and reduced doses
were scheduled for advanced age patients. Given the
relatively low frequency of BL and the difficulty in
obtaining a large sample of patients, it was critical to
obtain 2 groups with homogeneous initial characteristics and treatment to perform an adequate comparison of toxicities. Thus, we limited the analysis to the
2 groups of patients receiving the highest dose of
chemotherapy, including 2 cycles with high-dose
cytarabine (C-cycles). The 36 patients selected represented 82% of all patients diagnosed with BL during
the accrual period and included 100% of all HIVpositive patients for the whole period. The clinical
characteristics and the immune status of the HIVpositive cohort are typical in the AIDS-related BL in
the HAART-era setting. BL usually occurs early in the
course of HIV disease and often presents as the initial AIDS-defining illness in the setting of higher CD4
counts. However, BL was the AIDS-defining disease
in only 20% of the study population in the current
study. This emphasizes the finding that is not a short
evolution of HIV infection but rather an adequate
control of viral load that is the likely factor responsible for an adequate tolerance to treatment. The relatively good immune function and low or negative
HIV viral load of the patients included in the study
do not represent a selection bias but a real change in
patient characteristics with the widespread introduction of HAART treatment in the last decade, and further suggests that this subset of patients must be
offered the benefit of aggressive chemotherapy regimens despite significantly higher toxicities.5,6
The short-term toxicity of the regimen proved to
be high irrespective of the HIV status of patients and
was particularly manifested by myelosuppression,
mucositis, and neutropenia-related infections. Therefore, most patients required in-patient care. The early
death rate was also significant (14%), although not
higher than in other studies including rituximab22 or
not.7,8
With no relapses among HIV-infected patients,
infectious toxicity was the only factor to account for
the 10% difference in survival in favor of HIV-negative patients, although this difference did not achieve
statistical significance. However, the clinical outcome
of HIV-positive patients was not significantly affected
in terms of CR, DFS, or OS rates. Outcome of HIVpositive patients in the current study was similar to

that referred in other recent multicenter trials including rituximab24 and unparalleled by prior results
with intensive chemotherapy only.4–8
In the absence of available results of larger trials,
the current data strongly suggest a possible benefit
of immunochemotherapeutic approaches in the
treatment of BL in all patients. Our CR, OS, and DFS
rates confirm the remarkable efficacy observed in
other preliminary studies24 in a group of patients
with high-risk features. Given the small number of
patients analyzed, it is not possible to assess the
impact of the addition of rituximab to intensive
chemotherapy yet. Although the results appear promising both for HIV-positive and negative patients,
evolving methods of supportive care over the last 10
years may account for part of the difference. For
HIV-positive patients in particular, the use of HAART
in all the patients analyzed precludes an adequate
comparison with prior studies,4–6 where HAART use
was not warranted in every patient. Still, the relapse
rate is impressively low (1 patient), making infectious
complications the main direct cause of death during
induction or in complete remission (5 of 7, 71%).
Systemic sepsis and lung involvement caused by fungal agents were present in most documented cases.
It is important to note that severe fungal infections
were the major cause of induction death (thus, in
patients not yet heavily treated) affecting HIVinfected and noninfected patients equally.
Larger ongoing prospective studies may help to
elucidate the extent of the contribution of rituximab
to the efficacy of BL treatment,11,25 although formal
randomized studies are unlikely to be performed in
such a relatively uncommon entity. Larger studies
including low- and high-risk patients may also identify prognostic factors that the design and statistical
power of our study did not allow detecting. Our
results support the inclusion of HIV-infected patients
in such protocols. Furthermore, the low relapse rate
observed argues in favor of considering the addition
of rituximab, rather than increasing the dose intensity of chemotherapeutic agents in future approaches
to BL. Furthermore, recruitment and extended follow-up of our currently ongoing protocol may eventually identify HIV-positive patients at higher risk of
major toxicity and relapse. It may also help to elucidate if immune reconstitution is as relevant to outcome as it appears to be in pre-rituximab trials.4,8
In summary, we have prospectively demonstrated that intensive immunochemotherapy can be
administered safely to patients with Burkitt lymphoma or leukemia and HIV infection, with comparable results to those observed in HIV-negative
patients.
