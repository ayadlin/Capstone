ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to reconsider the biological characteristics of epithelioid
malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (E-MpM) in the light of new concepts about
epithelial mesenchymal transition and mesenchymal epithelial reverse transition
(EMT/MErT) and the role of epigenetic reprogramming in this context. To this end we
profiled surgical specimens and derived cells cultures by a number of complementary
approaches i.e. immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization,
biochemistry, pluripotent stem cell arrays, treatments with cytokines, growth factors
and specific inhibitors.
The analyses of the surgical specimens showed that i) EZH2 is expressed throughout
the spectrum of MpM, ii) that E-MpM (including the high-grade undifferentiated form)
are characterised by c-MYC and miRNA 17-5p expression, and iii) that progression
to sarcomatoid MpM is dictated by EMT regulators. They also showed that E-MpM
expressed c-MET and are enriched in E- and P-cadherins- and VEGFR2-expressing CSCs,
thus strongly supporting a role for MErT reprogramming in endowing E-MpM tumour
cells with stemness and plasticity, and hence with a drug resistant phenotype. The cell
culture-based experiments confirmed the stemness traits and plasticity of E-MpM, and
support the view that EZH2 is a druggable target in this tumor.

adhesion molecules [2, 3]. The activation of EMT makes
cancer cells highly plastic [4], and enable non-cancer stem
cells to acquire the traits of cancer stem cells (CSCs) [5].
Two recent studies [6, 7] have challenged the field
of EMT research by introducing the concept of hybrid
EMT. Both studies suggest that cells that undergo partial
EMT, i.e. cells co-expressing epithelial and mesenchymal
markers, are more plastic and have an high degree of

stemness sustained by cell-cell adhesion compared to fully
transited cells. This new view implies that cells with a
hybrid phenotype can exploit a wider repertoire of survival
strategies thus making it easier to evade cell death and
anti-cancer treatments.
Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MpM) is a
heterogeneous, aggressive tumour mainly caused by
exposure to asbestos. It has been shown that all three
types of asbestos are the most potent micro-enviromental
inducers of MErT by means of an epigenetic process [8] or
direct interaction with mesothelial cells [9]. MpMs express
markers such as calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6 and podoplanin
[10, 11], which are routinely used for diagnosis, and markers
that have been more recently described such as VEGFR2
[12] and c-MET [13], or more widely explored in preclinical settings such as E-cadherin [14] and c-MYC [15].
MErT can be initiated by many signalling effectors
[16], including the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor
(HGF/SF)-mediated activation of c-MET in mesenchymal
cells [17, 18]. It has been reported that, in addition to
mediating intracellular cohesion, E-cadherin participates
in regulating stemness [19–21], and the same is true for
c-MYC [22, 23]. The recently described co-expression
of E- and P-cadherin is particularly interesting as it has
been reported to be a marker of stemness [24] or related to
poor prognosis [25], and can be seen in the hybrid state of
EMT/MErT [6, 7, 24].
It has been suggested that EMT is a significant
morphological feature of malignant mesothelioma [25],
and that aberrant polycomb-group (PcG) protein expression
contributes to the pathogenesis of MpM [26]. We here
propose a model of MpM in which the epithelioid variant
(E-MpM), the most frequently encountered, at this site
has the characteristics of MErT, and displays features
of reprogramming with involvement of c-MYC, E- and
P-cadherins and VEGFR2 as CSC regulators. E-MpMs
may progress toward the undifferentiated high-grade (HGMpM) variant or a sarcomatous MpM (S-MpM), which is
characterised by a change in immunophenotypical make up
from the pluripotent OMSK (OCT4, c-MYC SOX2, and
KLF4) marker c-MYC to the TWIST and SLUG EMT
regulators. The PcG protein EZH2, which acts as a catalytic
subunit in polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and is
shared by the methylation signatures of DNA and histone
marks [27] emerges as a possible druggable target.

(IHC), immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization (ISH),
biochemistry and human pluripotent cell array. Cultured
E-MpM tumour cells derived from the specimens were
then used to confirm in vivo observation on stemness and
plasticity by challenging them with cytokines and growth
factors as well as small drugs (bevacizumab, sunitinib and
GSK 126).

Surgical specimen analyses
Comparison of mesothelium and E-MpM expression
profiles
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
VEGFR2 and c-MET were expressed by the E-MpM
specimens and mesothelium (Table 1 and Figure 1),
in line with recent reports [12, 13], and the same was
true of the pleiotropic marker c-MYC [22, 23, 28]. In
the mesothelium, E-cadherin expression was faint and
heterogeneous, whereas the EZH2 catalytic unit of PRC2
[26], which has been reported to be expressed at low levels
in normal cells [26, 29], was undetectable and Slug was
negative (Supplementary Figure S1). With the exception
of the undetectable EZH2, non-activated mesothelium
seems to bear the basic machinery exploited by E-MpMs.
Immunoprofiles of the surgical specimens of MpM
variants
EZH2 was expressed by the entire spectrum of
MpM surgical specimens, although to different extents
(Table 1 and Figure 1). The loss of INI1-mediated EZH2
upregulation [30] was excluded by IHC (not shown).
Unlike that of EZH2, the expression of OMSK cocktailrelated c-MYC transcription factor (TF) [22], the receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) c-MET and VEGFR2, and the
adhesion molecule E-cadherin segregated with the E-MpM
variant (Table 1 and Figure 1).
In terms of cell immunostaining distribution, c-MET
expression was mainly restricted to cell membranes,
whereas the expression of VEGFR2 was both membranous
and cytoplasmic, thus suggesting that it may play a noncanonical role. The expression of both markers was
confirmed by ISH at RNA level (Supplementary Figure
S2). E-cadherin showed membrane reactivity, in line
with its role in promoting pluripotency by means of cellto-cell adhesion [19, 21, 31]. The percentage of nuclei
immunolabelled by the specific c-MYC and EZH2
antibodies was similar in most of the E-MpM specimens,
with an increase paralleling that of Ki-67 restricted to cases
#16 and #17 (Table 1, Figure 1). This finding suggests that
these two cases may represent an intermediate point in the
spectrum of progression toward the HG/undifferentiated
form of E-MpM (see below).
The S-MpM specimens (cases #20 and 21, Table 1)
showed the loss of E-cadherin as well as c-MYC, VEGFR2
and c-MET and were enriched in cells expressing the
SLUG (Figure 1) and TWIST (not shown) nuclear TFs,

RESULTS
Our working hypothesis was that the phenotypical
reversion of EMT (MErT) characterises the epithelial
variant of peritoneal mesothelioma (E-MpM), and
that this variant is plastic and has some of the traits of
CSCs. To address this hypothesis, we analysed surgical
specimens (17 E-MpMs, 2 HG E-MPM and 2 S-MpMs,
Table 1) obtained from 21 untreated patients, using an
integrated approach including immunohistochemistry

with a large percentage of nuclei decorated by EZH2 and

The immunophenotypical analysis highlighted the
fact that not all E-MpMs progress to S-MpMs, but there
is a type of upgraded form of E-MpMs that retains a
immunoprofile more close to E-MpM (cases #18 and #19,
Table 1, Figure 1). The increase in EZH2 in HG MpMs

is consistent with the reported increase in the level of
TGFbeta (see below and Figure 5), its acknowledged role
in maintaining CSCs [32] and the decreased expression
of E-cadherin [33]. Taken together, these findings suggest
that c-MYC or EMT regulators respectively concur
in MErT and EMT via the EZH2 chromatin modifier.
The c-MYC findings are in line with its role as a core

HG E-MpMs (#18 and #19, Table 1) and two S-MpMs (#20 and #21, Table 1). The classic E-MpM is characterised by a positive triple
immunophenotype including VEGFR2, c-MET and E-cadherin, whose intensity and the number of immunolabelled cells decreases in the
progressed case, become even less in the HG E-MpM, and disappear in the S-MpM. The reverse is true in the case of c-MYC, EZH2 and
Mib-1, which decorate an increasing number of cells going from E-MpM to HG E-MpM. SLUG is constantly negative. On the other hand,
S-MpM always has a negative triple immunophenotype and c-MYC immunostaining, but show SLUG positivity, and the expression of
EZH2 and Mib-1 are similar to that in HG E-MpM. S-MpM3 has one pleomorphic and one spindle area (identified by parentheses). The
image gallery of three additional cases of E-MpM (#11, #13 and #16) shown in Supplementary Figures 4, 5 and 7 shows that VEGFR2

of miRNAs to influence tumorigenesis in a cell-specific
manner [36].
Biochemistry

miRNA 17-5p in situ hybridisation

Using the cryopreserved material obtained from
each halved surgical sample before fixation, we used
Western blotting (WB) to confirm MET and VEGFR2
expression, and interrogate the activation status of c-MET
(Figure 2B) and VEGFR2. Unexpectedly, very little or
no activation of VEGFR2 was observed (Figure 2C).
To address this issue, we first investigated VEGFR2/
MET co-immunoprecipitation in order to explore the
hypothesis of VEGFR2 silencing- induced phosphatasemediated MET up-regulation [37]. As both analyses
were unsuccessful (data not shown), we made in vitro
analyses of cells obtained from frozen surgical material
(see Figure 4, VEGFR2 switching off) in order investigate
possible stemness in E-MpMs. Recent studies have shown
that sunitinib-mediated VEGFR2 silencing participates

As the observed modulation of c-MYC in E-MPMs
and S-MPMs paralleled the level of miRNA 17-5p, we
used ISH to investigate miRNA 17-5p expression in two
cases of E-MpM (#1 and #11, Table 1) and one of S-MpM
(S-MpM3, case #20, Table 1). This miRNA belongs to
a cluster of miRNAs in human chromosome 13 that has
been reported to be activated by c-MYC [35]. The two
E-MpMs expressed high levels of miRNA 17-5p, with
granular cytoplasmic expression in less than 25% of the
tumoral cells and signal intensity ranging from moderate to
strong (score ≥6), whereas no signal was expressed by the
S-MpM (Figure 2A). These findings complement previous
observations [35] and reinforce the idea that miRNA 17-5p
in E-MpMs has oncogenic activity supporting the capacity

the E- and S-MpMs (#3 and #4) expressed E-cadherin. This discrepancy may be attributable to a difference in the E-cadherin epitopes
recognised by the IHC antibody (clone NCH-38, M3612, Dako) and the R&D E-cadherin antibody present in the array but, as both

that was enriched in cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) expressing smooth muscle actin (SMA) [43]
and characterised by SLUG decoration. They also had
a tumoral stromal component in which single cells
expressed lower levels of E-cadherin and P-cadherin,
and showed nuclear GATA4 immunoreactivity, findings
that were confirmed by the co-immunofluorescence
analysis (Figure 3). The same immunostaining pattern
was seen in two other cases (#6 and #7, Table 1) with a
well-developed, multifocal stromal component revealed
by hematoxylin and eosin. It is worth noting that FISH
analysis showed that all four cases had a diploid profile
in the CAF component (not shown), unlike the tumoral
cells that presented at least one FISH abnormality
(Supplementary Table S1).

Human pluripotent stem cell array
Pluripotent stem cell array analysis of the
frozen material also used for the WB experiments
revealed three factors in a ground state and therefore
characteristics of CSCs: VEGFR2, which was expressed
in E-MpM; E-cadherin, a MErT/EMT regulator that was
shared by E-MpMs and S-MpMs despite its irrelevant
immunophenotypical expression in S-MpMs; and GATA4,
a lineage control transcription factor that activates or
represses depending on the cell context [40, 41] and was
restricted to two E-MpM cases (#14 and #15, Table 1,
Figure 2D).
Together with the immunophenotype data, the stem
cell array readouts pointed at E-cadherin as a stemness
regulator (attributable to its ability to form cell-cell
adhesion exchanges) [19], and support a pluripotencyrelated role of dephosphorylated VEGFR2.

Cell cultures
In order to investigate stemness and plasticity
further, we used short-term cultures and stable cell
lines obtained from the same surgical specimens as
those analysed by means of IHC, immunofluorescence,
biochemistry and the pluripotent stem cell array.

Hybrid immunophenotyping

Characterisation of two short-term cell lines and one
spontaneous stabilised cell line

In the light of the recent suggestion that the hybrid
epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype plays a key
role in stemness as well as in MErT and EMT [6], we
applied IHC and immunoflourescence to investigate the
distribution of E-cadherin and VEGFR2 in individual
E-MpM tumoral cells of the histological fixed samples.
The IHC and immunofluorescence analyses showed
that, although some cells were decorated by E-cadherin or
VEGFR2 alone, a considerable number co-expressed both
markers (case #1, Table 1, Figure 2E and Supplementary
Figure S3). This confirms the hybrid phenotype, highlights
E-MpM heterogeneity, and suggests that the tumour
may endow the cells with some of the characteristics of
stemness and plasticity.
Furthermore, as it has been shown that P-cadherin
expression is crucial to identifying the intermediate EMT
state and cells with CSC properties when concomitantly
expressed with E-cadherin [42], we investigated our samples
using P-/E-cadherin antibodies and broadened the panel to
include beta-catenin. P-/E-cadherin immunodecoration and
immunofluorescence co-labelling proved to be restricted
to E-MpMs and, once again, had a patchwork distribution
and beta-catenin immunostaining revealed membrane
expression, as previously reported [24] (Figure 2F).
Taken together, these findings confirm that the EMT
in cancer has features of plastic process with multiple
intermediate states rather than a “all or nothing” response
[6], and support the idea that E-MpM is governed by its
conversion to MErT.
Interestingly, the two cases expressing GATA4
as revealed by the pluripotent stem cell array (#14 and
#15, Table 1) had a well-developed stromal component
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Starting from fresh E-MpM surgical samples, two
short-term cell lines (STC1 and STC2, corresponding to
E-MpM cases #11 and #13, Table 1) and one spontaneous
stable cell line (SSL1, corresponding to case #16
E-MpM) were established, characterised, and used in in
vitro experiments. STC1 (Supplementary Figure S4) and
STC2 (Supplementary Figure S5) both consisted of large,
round, epithelial-like cells, and had an immunophenotype
that was fully consistent with E-MpM, except for the
activation of VEGFR2 shared by both cell lines and SLUG
expression restricted to STC1 (Supplementary Figure S6).
The spontaneously obtained SSL1 cell line was mainly
made up of spindle-shaped cells but also included cells
with epithelioid features (Supplementary Figure S6). Its
immunophenotype was consistent with E-MpM in terms
of c-MET, c-MYC and EZH2 expression, but E-cadherin
levels were low, SLUG was expressed, and there was
no VEGFR2 expression (Supplementary Figure S6-S7).
This phenotype, which strongly suggested an attenuated
epithelioid phenotype consistent with MErT, and a
transition towards an intermediate rather than a full EMT
phenotype, was not unexpected as the cell line was derived
from case #16, the most “progressed” of the E-MpMs.
As this intermediate (epithelioid/mesenchymal)
phenotype was shown by the cells immediately after
seeding and was maintained during the passages (in
terms of cytokeratin CAM 5.2/CD44 co-expression, data
not shown), we concluded that SSL1 is a stable hybrid
cell population co-expressing epithelial (CAM 5.2)/
mesenchymal as well as CSCs (CD44) markers. It is
worth noting that compared to the surgical specimens
75508

from which they were derived the cell lines had a more
mixed profile including features of both HG E-MpM and
S-MpM. These changes probably represent an incomplete
switch towards a mesenchymal phenotype endowed with
high degree of plasticity because of the partial EMT [6].

status as shown by the increase in SLUG protein and RNA
(Figures. 4B and 4C), even if this did not result in full
EMT. Further support to the concept of incomplete EMT
was given by the retained epithelioid morphology of STC1
and STC2 after VEGFR2 had been switched off (compare
Figure 4D with Figure 5).

Stemness and plasticity experiments

CSC array-based comparative analysis

Given the characteristics of the short-term
cultures and the stable cell line, we used the first (which
showed activated VEGFR2) to investigate whether
phosphorylation had an impact on stemness, and the
second (which had more mesenchymal traits) to verify the
more metastable plasticity of E-MpMs.

As pluripotent genes are critical for maintaining
pluripotency, we used CSC array to compare the number
of CSC genes between an E-MpM and glioblastoma
cell line (which is known to harbour a high percentage
of CSCs) [44] as a means of further confirming that
E-MpMs are enriched in CSC cells. The results showed
the transcriptional enrichment of genes known to be overexpressed in mesenchymal stem cells (Thy1, Fgfr2, Axl,
Alcam and CD105) and genes involved in controlling
pluripotency (c-MYC and ID1) in STC1 (Figure 4E).

The pharmacological switching off of VEGFR2
STC1 and STC2 were treated for 24 hours with
bevacizumab (a specific VEGFR2 inhibitor) and sunitinib
(an inhibitor of the PDGFR family, VEGFR2 and c-MET).
In addition to reduce the activation of their targets
(stronger in sunitinib respect to bevacizumab treatments,
Figure 4A), both drugs induced an increase in SLUG
(Figure 4B). Overall, the experiments demonstrated that
VEGFR2 activation induces SLUG degradation, and
that its switching off leads to a more primitive CSC-like

MpM plasticity
After HGF stimulation, SSL1 showed a decrease of
EZH2 expression (Figure 5A). Conversely, the treatment
of SSL1 with TGFbeta1/IL1 induced an increase in EZH2
(Figure 5B). On the contrary, c-MYC levels remained
stable during both treatments.

Overall, these findings are in keeping with the
idea that MErT and EMT are transient and reversible
conditions, and that mesothelioma cells can feature a
dynamic phenotype that allow them to shift from more
epithelioid (MErT) or more mesenchymal traits (EMT)
and back.

126, which lead to a reduction in growth and a decrease in
SLUG transcription (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
Most previous studies have focused on the role of
EMT and very few have investigated MErT, particularly
in the context of mesothelioma. Our findings provide
evidence that E-MpM is enriched in stemness and
plasticity governed by an MErT process.

EZH2 pharmacological inhibition by GSK 126
To verify whether EZH2 inhibition could be
therapeutically exploited in E-MpM, we treated SSL1

the corresponding dots in treated and untreated samples. After bevacizumab treatment, PDGFRB and VEGFR2 respectively showed
activation (from 8.25 to 9.26) and deactivation (from 6.92 to 6.40). After sunitinib treatment, both PDGFRB and VEGFR2 were completely
de-phosphorylated. Both drugs induced an increase in SLUG (the relative changes in SLUG expression were calculated using ImageJ

Cat. No. PAHS-176Z). Hprt was chosen as the reference house-keeping gene because its transcription level was similar in STC1 and U-87
(i.e. a cycle threshold of about 24 in both lines). The most significantly over-transcribed genes are shown in the figure. The results underline
the transcriptional enrichment of mesenchymal (Thy1, FGFR2, AXL, ALCAM and CD105) and staminal genes (c-MYC and ID1) in STC1
in comparison with U-87. Original magnification 10x; scale bar 10 μM (inset).

MpM arises from the mesothelium, a mesenchymal
tissue derived from the celomic epithelium expressing
WT1 [45] that has an intrinsic ability to differentiate
along both the epithelial and mesenchymal axes. This
trait is preserved in MpM. We began our analysis by
investigating the status of c-MET, which is known to
favour mesenchymal-epithelial transition [17], in a
series of surgical specimens. The expression/activation
of c-MET proved to be restricted to E-MpM and, focally
and to a very little extent, its direct high-grade (HG)
progression. The HGF/c-MET activation loop, that
possibly reflects the cell response to asbestos-induced
DNA damage, triggers mesothelial cell reprogramming.
This phenomenon may directly affects bivalent
mesothelial cells [45] but also mesothelial cells that have
acquired a myofibroblast phenotype after a first EMT
round triggered by an inflammatory asbestos-induced
repair response [46].
The aim of the subsequent surgical specimenbased analyses was to identify the interactions between
chromatin-modifying factors, TFs, adhesion molecules
and RTKs, and showed that EZH2 was increasingly
expressed from E-MpM to HG E-MpM and S-MpM,
whereas c-MYC, E-cadherin and VEGFR2 expression
was restricted to E-MpMs. The expression of c-MYC
not only increased within the E-MpM spectrum, but
also closely correlated the expression of miRNA 175p, a non coding c-MYC regulated RNA that has been
reported to contribute to highly malignant tumours in
humans and promote stem cell properties in mice [37].
On the basis of these findings, and bearing in mind the
spectrum-wide role played by c-MYC [15, 22, 23, 28,
36] and the typical wide spread presentation of MpM,
we hypothesised that c-MYC may facilitate and maintain
[47] the CSC-like status of E-MpM cells during their
characteristic metastatic-like seeding of the abdominal
cavity [11] that acts as hospitable soil similar to an
enlarged niche [48].
Further robust support of the stemness of E-MpM
was given by the pluripotent stem cell array readouts,
which allowed us to investigate the existence of the hybrid
E-cadherin/VEGFR2 phenotype that may provide E-MpM
cells with stemness and plasticity by exploiting epithelialrelated cell-cell adhesion and mesenchymal-related
migration. The membranous decoration of E-cadherin,
P-cadherin [6, 42], and beta-catenin [24] also supported
the presence of the E/M phenotype and its association with
stemness and plasticity (Figure 3).
The results also suggested that the progression
to HG E-MpM may occur in two different ways. In the
first case, which may correspond to that described as
transitional or, more probably HG/undifferentiated MpM
[11], the E-MpM cells retain the immunophenotypical
profile but activate c-MYC and EZH2. This correlates
with a high tumor proliferation index (Ki-67) and, due
to EZH2 overexpression, a decrease in E-cadherin (Table
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1, cases #18 and #19) [49]. The hypothesis of direct
progression is supported by evidence of E-MpM cases
with increasingly malignant characteristics, such as our
cases #16 and #17. The second type of progression is the
progression to S-MpM. In this case, c-MYC is replaced by
the expression of the EMT regulators SLUG and TWIST,
with down regulation of E-cadherin, VEGFR2 and c-MET.
The modulation of the immunoprofile is in line with the
ability of c-MYC to counteract the EMT pathway [50]
and, as happens in embryonic stem cells [51], interfere
with the epigenetic regulation of CSCs [52].
Overall, our findings suggest a model in which the
reprogramming is driven by MErT in E-MpM and by EMT
in S-MpM (Figure 6). During such reprogramming, it is
thought that the interaction between TFs and the epigenetic
regulators is essential to induce the decommission of their
poised status in order to activate/repress transcriptionally
the specific context-dictated epithelial/mesenchymal
genes. Here, the c-MYC and EMT regulators representing
TFs and the histone protein EZH2 acting as a surrogate of
epigenetic regulators, while P-/E-cadherin and VEGFR2
cooperate in giving a hybrid phenotype that endows
E-MpM cells with stem cell characteristics.
In addition to E-/P-cadherin and VEGFR2, two
our E-MpMs investigated by means of pluripotent stem
cell array also showed the expression of GATA4, another
stemess-related marker. The signature of these two cases
(subsequently joined the two fixed cases #6 and #7,
Table 1) closely mirrored that of E-MpM but they also
had a well-developed stromal component enriched in
CAFs expressing SLUG and TWIST, thus supporting the
idea that CAFs may elicit the acquisition of stem-like traits
and/or favour EMT [53, 54]. No evidence of malignancy
of the stromal component was found in any of these cases,
but the tumoral cells showed nuclear immunoreactivity
when challenged with GATA 4 antibody and retained,
albeit decreased, E-cadherin decoration. The interplay
between GATA4 and E-cadherin is in line with the noncanonical GATA4-type of EMT in which GATA4 triggers
a E-cadherin-mediated redistribution that affects adhesion
and facilitates collective cell migration without interfering
with the RNA or protein levels of E-cadherin [55]. These
findings further support the hybrid nature of tumoral cells
and raise the hypothesis that the observed changes may
represent an early phase of progression to a biphasic
variant of MpM.
Short-term cultures allowed us to identify a
possible unprecedented role for VEGFR2. Whilst
canonical VEGFR2 activation is typically marked by
SLUG degradation, VEGFR2 novel and activationindependent activity is associated with SLUG expression
(Figure 4). It is worth noting that the extent expression of
SLUG was moderate, and this is in line with the partial,
hybrid phenotype known to endow tumour cells with
stemness [6]. These results disregard the expectancies
generated by the recently re-proposed vascular featuring

immunophenotype of E-MpM (VEGFR2 expression and/
or VEGFR2/MET co-expression in E-MpM) [12] for a
role of anti-angiogenic treatments.
The hypothesis that E-MpM is made up of cells
with stem-like properties was also supported by the
results obtained by applying the cancer stem cell profiler
complemented by PCR to STC1. The readouts highlighted
the transcriptional enrichment of genes known to be
involved in maintaining pluripotency (c-MYC and ID1)
[22, 56] or highly expressed in mesenchymal stem
cells (Thy1, Fgfr2, Axl, Alcam and CD105) [57–59].
Furthermore, our SSL1 experiments demonstrated that
E-MpM has a high degree of plasticity: when challenged
with TGFβ1/IL1b, the tumoral cells acquired a more

mesenchymal phenotype but, when challenged with HFG,
they acquired a more epithelioid phenotype. Finally, given
the biological characteristics of our E-MpM specimens,
we treated the most spindle cell-enriched E-MpM-derived
SSL1 cell line with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK 126. The
observed reduction in cell proliferation strongly suggests
that it is worth considering the possibility of using
chromatin modifiers or inhibitors to treat patients with
mesotheliomas.
On the basis of our findings as a whole, we propose
a model in which E-MpM may be viewed as a disease
essentially composed by cells with an hybrid phenotype
within the MErT framework. In this model, rather than
corresponding to a more differentiation-committed entity,

Figure 6: Proposed E-MpM model. The model suggests that, once having overcome the senescence barrier A., (see also Supplementary

Table S1) which per se significantly increases the yield of CSC colonies, the cells enter MErT to up-regulate pluripotency as a result of a
c-MET/HGF loop B. The expression of c-MYC, miRNA 17-5p and E-cadherin seems to be necessary and sufficient to trigger the initial
steps of MErT. Thereafter, the interaction of c-MYC and EZH2 (acting as surrogate epigenomic mediators determining cell fate) allows and
maintains the hybrid E-cadherin/VEGFR2 phenotype (the hallmark of E-MpM) and the concomitant expression of P- and E-cadherin. As
demonstrated by our cell culture experiments, these hybrids are endowed with stemness traits and a high degree of plasticity. During disease
progression, in keeping with the plasticity of MErT/EMT processes, the hybrid MErT phenotype can progress to high-grade E-MpM or
acquire the full EMT leading to S-MpM. This parallels the decommissioning c-MYC, which is replaced by EMT regulator expression
(SLUG and TWIST). As a lineage control factor, GATA-4 may be involved in resetting progression, and be a prerequisite for biphasic
E-MpM (E-MpM showing separated areas of both sarcomatous and epithelial elements).

E-MpM represents a state of greater, plastic, stemnessenriched tumoral growth that is likely to be poorly
responsive to traditional treatment but may respond to
epigenetic regulator inhibitors. This possibility is further
supported by the recently reported inverse correlation
between strong EZH2 expression and the loss of the
chromatin modifier BAP-1 [60], whose increasingly
deregulated nature in sporadic mesotheliomas [61] we are
currently investigating.

used to detect the expression of VEGFR2, c-MET,
E-cadherin, c-MYC, EZH2, Ki67, SLUG, TWIST,
P-cadherin, beta catenin, 1A4 actin, GATA4, p16, BAP1
and INI1 are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunofluorescence

In situ hybridization (ISH)
The c-MET RNA, VEGFR2 RNA and microRNA
(miRNA) 17-5p ISH methods are described in the
supplementary material.
The co-expression of E-cadherin, VEGFR2,
E-cadherin/P-cadherin and E-cadherin/GATA4 was
investigated by means of immunofluorescence. The
primary antibodies were diluted and retrieved as described
in the supplementary material, and the slides were then
incubated for one hour at room temperature with the
specific secondary Alexa Fluor antibody (Alexa Fluor 488
and 546, Thermo Fischer Scientific, MA, USA).

Patient samples
The case material consisted of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical samples obtained
from 21 previously untreated patients (who subsequently
underwent cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy).
On the basis of the proposed TMN staging of MpM
[62], all but one patient (case #12, Table 1) were in stage
2 (10 patients) or 3 (10 patients). The diagnoses made
on the basis of morphological and immunophenotypical
criteria (calretinin, WT1, cytokeratin 5/6) [11] as well as
podoplanin as proposed in the WHO classification [10]
were 17 E-MpMs (#1-17, Table 1), two HG E-MPM
(#18-19, Table 1) and two S-MpMs (#20-21, Table 1).
Frozen material was available for biochemical analyses
of 11 patients, three of whom also provided additional
fresh material for the primary cell culture experiments.
Finally, three FFPE omentum samples were obtained
from unrelated MpM patients. Written informed consent
was obtained from all of the patients in accordance with
the regulations of the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione
IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.

Western blotting and phospho-Receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) array
All of the analyses were made using frozen material
taken from the patient samples (Table 1). VEGFR2
activation was investigated using a phospho-RTK
array kit (Proteome Profiler™ Array, ARY001B, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 1 mg of protein
lysate in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol.
The Western blot (WB) conditions used to detect c-MET,
c-MYC, EZH2, SLUG and β-actin expression and c-MET
activation are shown in Supplementary Table S3.
Protein amounts were evaluated using ImageJ
software in accordance the manufacturer’s instructions.
Human pluripotent stem cell array
Stem cell marker expression was assessed by
means of a human pluripotent stem cell array kit (Cat.
No. ARY010 R&D Systems) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ
hybridisation (FISH) and PCR assessments of p16,
NF2 and BAP1
All of the cases were analysed for P16 and NF2
gene status by FISH, P16 gene promoter methylation by
means of PCR, and p16 and BAP1 expression by means
of IHC. The methodological details and results are given
in the supplementary material and Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2. In brief, 18 cases had overcome senescence:
12 cases showed the inactivation of P16 (detected by
means of FISH and/or promoter methylation and/or IHC),
6 cases the loss of BAP1 and 1 case the loss of BAP1/
NF2. The remaining three cases showed the loss of BAP1,
together with the loss of NF2 in one case (Supplementary
Table S1).

Primary cell cultures
Establishment and characterisation
Two short-term cell cultures and one stable cell line
were obtained starting from the fresh material of three
patients (Table 1) and characterised by means of WB,
flow cytometry and IHC as described in the supplementary
material.
RNA analyses
RNA extracted from mesothelioma cell cultures and
the U-87 glioma cell line (American Tissues Cell Cultures,
Cat. No HTB-14), was quantified and retro-transcribed
as described in the supplementary material. The cancer
stem cell genes were investigated using RT2 Profiler PCR
array cancer stem cells (Cat. No. PAHS-176Z, Qiagen,
