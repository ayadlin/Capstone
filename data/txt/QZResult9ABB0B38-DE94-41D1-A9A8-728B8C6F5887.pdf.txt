ABSTRACT
In development of amphibians and flies, gene amplification is one of mechanisms
to increase gene expression. In mammalian cells, gene amplification seems to be
restricted to tumorigenesis and acquiring of drug-resistance in cancer cells. Here,
we report a complex gene amplification pattern in mouse neural progenitor cells
during differentiation with approximately 10% of the genome involved. Half of the
amplified mouse chromosome regions overlap with amplified regions previously
reported in human neural progenitor cells, indicating conserved mechanisms during
differentiation. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we verified the amplification
in single cells of primary mouse mesencephalon E14 (embryonic stage) neurosphere
cells during differentiation. In vivo we confirmed gene amplifications of the TRP53
gene in cryosections from mouse embryos at stage E11.5. Gene amplification is not
only a cancer-related mechanism but is also conserved in evolution, occurring during
differentiation of mammalian neural stem cells

interpreted based on threshold settings that were consistent
with the hypothesis of an intact genome. In addition these
imbalances were found between tissue samples including
brain, testis, liver and blood samples [7]. These tissues
were known to contain stem cells and differentiating cells
of varying stage. To explain the genomic imbalances
authors frequently blame preparation conditions and the
influence of early and late replication timing. As of now,
there is, however, no final evidence about the origin of
the imbalances that are observed throughout many studies.
Our results on human neural progenitor cells are
indicative of amplification as physiological process
during stages of differentiation [5]. To follow up on this
finding, we set out to investigate the hypothesis that
gene amplifications occur as a developmental process in
different species. Interestingly double minutes (DMs) as
cytogenetic manifestations of gene amplification were
found in 1% of serum free mouse embryo (SFME) cells
and an increased frequency of DMs was found in cells
grown in medium containing fetal calf serum (FCS) [8].
SFME cells were a neural stem cell line consisting of

INTRODUCTION
DNA sequence amplification is a phenomenon
that occurs predictably at defined stages during normal
development in Xenopus, Drosophila, Sciara and
Tetrahymena [1–4]. A cell’s strategy of amplifying genes
represents a means of satisfying a heavy demand for stagespecific proteins [1]. These amplifications affect specific DNA
regions and appear during narrow windows of development
[4]. In mammals, gene amplification appears to be absent in
normal cells but commonly occurs in cancer cells. However,
we recently published first evidence for gene amplifications
during differentiation of human neural progenitor cells [5].
Recent publications on haploid embryonic stem
cells reported an intact genome without amplifications
and losses. However, comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) data in these studies showed genomic imbalances
that were not further investigated due to the selected
threshold for amplification detection [6]. Likewise
genomic imbalances reported for stem cells and/
or induced pluripotent stem cells have always been

neural progenitor cells that are capable of differentiating
into astrocytes when grown with growth factor TGF-ß
or fetal calf serum (FCS). SFME cells were routinely
cultivated on fibronectin coated culture ware. Many
studies however have shown, that cell surface interactions
of neural stem cells to extracellular matrix proteins
(e.g. fibronectin, laminin) were capable of inducing cell
differentiation processes suggesting synergic effects of
adhesion and growth factor signals [9]. Sphere growth
was reported for SFME cells as unattached multicellular
aggregates in the absence of fibronectin [10]. Here
we analyzed mouse neural progenitor cells during
differentiation using SFME sphere cells and primary
mesencephalon E14 neurosphere cells. Since both,
our previous human and the present mouse analyses,
are performed with cells under in vitro differentiation
conditions, we also investigate amplifications on mouse
embryo tissue sections to provide in vivo evidence for
gene amplification as a physiological process.

conditions. Former studies showed an increased glial
differentiation specific GFAP mRNA expression 24 h after
TGF-ß addition and 8–16 h after FCS addition. Based on
these observations we choose to analyze undifferentiated
SFME cells grown as spheres, SFME cells grown for
12 h with 10% FCS, and SFME cells grown for 24 h
with TGF-ß. As shown in Figure 1a–1c we found clear
morphology changes between the treatments. The SFME
cells were also analyzed by immune fluorescence (Figure
1d–1f). Undifferentiated SFME cells expressed the neural
stem cell marker nestin. Out of the SFME cells that were
grown 24 h with TGF-ß, 30% of cells did not show nestin
expression but GFAP expression, 50% of cells showed
simultaneous nestin and GFAP expression and 10% of
cells showed only nestin expression. All SFME cells
that were grown for 12 h with 10% FCS showed GFAP
expression but no nestin expression.
The array-CGH experiments were done by a twocolor approach and all analyzed samples were compared
to mouse genomic DNA from Clontech. We established
the following data analysis pipeline to determine
amplifications: Following the array-CGH analysis, signal
intensities were extracted from scanned images of each
array using Roche NimbleGen NimbleScan v2.6 software.
Intensity values for Cy3 and Cy5 were spatially corrected,
normalized using Qspline normalization, and the log2 of
the ratios from Cy3/Cy5 intensity values were calculated.

RESULTS
Amplification analysis in SFME cells
To identify early differentiation-associated amplifi­
cations we performed array-CGH analysis on SFME
cells that were induced to differentiate using different

To reduce size and noise of the data we applied a 10 x
window-averaging step. To detect amplifications we used
the dynamic segMNT algorithm that identifies segments
by minimizing the squared error relative to the segment
mean. To detect representative alterations and to minimize
the identification of random alterations, we extracted
segments with segment means above a 0.1 threshold and
a size greater than 500 kb. Since we did not compare the
SFME cells to the original parental strain (BALB/c) but
to normal mouse cells DNA, we expected several CNVs
(copy number variations) between the individual mouse
samples. We therefore excluded chromosomal regions
representing CNVs from our results across all investigated
samples that were included in a list of CNVs published
in 2010 [11]. For the identification of differentiationassociated amplifications we further excluded chromosomal
regions that revealed a copy number gain with a comparable
log2 ratio value in all samples.
In total we detected 3 amplified regions in
undifferentiated SFME sphere cells and 89 amplified
chromosomal regions in 24 h-TGF-β-differentiation
induced SFME cells. Amplifications were detected on
all autosomal chromosomes with no specific clustering
on a specific chromosome. In 12 h-FCS-differentiation

induced SFME cells we detected only 13 amplified
regions. Interestingly 2 out of 13 chromosome regions
were solely detectable in FCS-differentiation induced
cells and 11 of 13 chromosome regions were detectable
under both differentiation induction conditions. The size
of the amplified chromosome region varied between 250
kb–22 Mb. Amplified regions are summarized in Table 1.
Representative array-CGH plots for mouse chromosomes
11, 9, 10 and 18 are shown in Figure 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d.
As an independent method of verifying amplification
in single cells, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). Representative BAC probes used for FISH analysis
were selected for both the amplified and the control region.
Corresponding gene names were only used for annotation
of the BAC probes. Localization of probes used for FISH
experiments are indicated in Figure 2. Two BAC probes
were selected for two amplified chromosome regions on
two different chromosomes with a log2 ratio value greater
0.24 (Table 1). We selected one region solely amplified in
TGF-ß differentiation induced cells on chromosome 9 and
one region amplified under both differentiation-induction
conditions on chromosome 11. Both amplified chromosome
regions were confirmed to be amplified using fluorescence
in situ hybridization on individual cells. Examples of

resolution using a log2 scale. Localization of BAC clones used for FISH analysis were indicated including known genes: C1QL1, GFAP
(RP23–235I12), TRP53 (RP23–150N14), EGFR (RP23–51E21), and COX10 (RP23–40P10) for chromosome 11; S1PR5 (RP23–4A11) for
chromosome 9; FZR1 (RP23–421E11), CDK4 (RP23–432F11), ANO4 (RP23–279E23), and TRHDE (RP23–361I2) for chromosome 10;
PDGFRb (RP23–143A24) for chromosome 18.

amplification of sequences on mouse chromosome 11q
detected in 24 h-TGF-β–differentiation induced cells are
illustrated in Figure 3a–3c. Amplifications were seen on
interphase nuclei revealing several fluorescence signals for
BAC RP23–235I12 (including C1QL1 gene in pink) and two
fluorescence signals for the control probe BAC RP23–51E21
(including EGFR gene in green). An example of normal copy
number fluorescence signals for BAC RP23–235I12 and the
control probe BAC RP23–51E21 is shown in Figure 3d.
Examples of sequence amplification on mouse chromosome
9q detected in 24 h-TGF-β–differentiation induced cells are

interphase nuclei revealing several fluorescence signals for
BAC probe RP23–4A11 (including S1PR5 gene in pink).
Examples of normal copy number fluorescence signals for
BAC RP23–4A11 are shown in Figure 3h.
Taken together, in differentiation induced SFME
we determined a wavy pattern of genomic imbalances
including amplifications that were confirmed in individual
cells by fluorescence-in-situ hybridizations. Comparing
our results with previously published results on arrayCGH in haploid embryonic stem cells revealed noteworthy
similarities. Representative chromosome plots for

chromosome 11 from SFME array-CGH were presented
in Figure 4a–4c. The pattern of imbalances present in
TGF-ß-differentiation induced SFME cells is very similar
to the pattern of imbalances at chromosome 11 in haploid
embryonic stem cells published by Leeb and Wutz 2011 as
presented in Figure 4d. This observation illustrates that far
more stem cells use the mechanism of gene amplification
during their development than hitherto believed.
Additional chromosome plots for chromosome
11 from array-CGH analysis at various time points and
differentiation induction conditions were supplied in a
Supplementary Figure S1a–S1d.

Analysis of amplified regions in mice
Previously, we reported 66 amplified chromosome
regions after a 2 day long differentiation induction
and 93 amplified chromosome regions after a 5 day
differentiation induction in human neural progenitor
cells [5]. We ask if and to what extend the human and the
mouse amplifications overlap on the chromosomal level.
Using UCSC-Genome Browser we converted mouse
chromosome regions amplified in SFME sphere cells

amplifications for C1QL1 on interphase nuclei from 24 h-TGF-β–differentiation induced SFME cells (a–c). C1QL1 specific BAC-probe
(RP23–235I12) was labeled in pink and control BAC probe (RP23–51E21) (containing EGFR) from the same chromosome was labeled
in green. Representative interphase nuclei without C1QL1 amplification from not-differentiated cells revealed comparable fluorescence
signals for C1QL1 and EGFR control probe (d) Interphase-FISH was used to confirm gene amplifications for S1PR5 on interphase nuclei
from 24 h TGF-β-differentiation induced cells (e–g). S1PR5 specific BAC-probe (RP23–4A11) was labeled in pink. Representative
interphase nuclei from undifferentiated cells revealed single copy fluorescence signals for gene S1PR5 (h) Nuclei were counterstained with

Several regions failed to convert completely because
sequences were split or duplicated. Out of 92 converted
mouse sequences, 46 showed an overlap with amplified
regions found in human neural progenitor cells after 5 day
differentiation induction and 3 regions showed an overlap
with amplified regions in human neural progenitor cells
after 2 day differentiation induction. A detailed overview
on this conversion is given in Table 1.

for FISH analysis were selected for both the amplified
and the control region. Localization of hybridization
probes for amplified loci and control probes from the
same chromosome are shown in Figure 2 and further
information including the percentage of cells with
amplification is summarized in Table 2. Undifferentiated
neurosphere cells revealed normal copy number in 100
analyzed nuclei. We induced differentiation in primary
mesencephalon E14 neurosphere cells for 2 or 3 days
in differentiation medium containing small amounts of
FCS as supplied by the manufacturer. Hybridization
of FZR1 against neurosphere cells differentiated for 2
days (Figure 5a, 5b) and for 3 days (Figure 5c) revealed
an increased number of fluorescence signals scattered
over the whole nucleus in contrast to two fluorescence
signals from the control probe ANO4. The increased
number of fluorescence signals along with the two signals
found for the control probe confirmed the amplification
of FZR1. Gene amplifications of CDK4 after 3 days of
differentiation induction are shown in Figure 5d. Gene
amplifications of TRP53 (Figure 5e), C1QL1 (Figure 5f),
S1PR5 (Figure 5g) and PDGFRb (Figure 5h) found in
3-day differentiation induced neurosphere cells confirmed
our array-CGH results.

differentiation-induced mesencephalon cells showed also
GFAP protein expression (Figure 6c).

Multiple amplification analysis
We also investigated whether cells revealed
multiple amplified chromosome regions per single cell.
For co-hybridization experiments we labeled FZR1 from
chromosome 10 with Alexa-594 in pink, TRP53 from
chromosome 11 with Alexa-488 in green, and C1QL1
from a second amplified region on chromosome 11 with
Alexa-555 in yellow. As shown in Figure 7a–7d a very
variable pattern of hybridization signals was detectable.
We found cells with normal copy number for all
investigated probes (i) cells with amplification of either
TRP53 (ii) or FZR1 (iii) amplification and cells with
co-amplification of probes from chromosome 11 (iv) or
co-amplification of all investigated probes (v and vi).

In vivo analysis of gene amplification
For in vivo analysis we selected a chromosome
region that was amplified in mouse and human neural
progenitor cells during in vitro differentiation. We selected
TRP53 for further confirmation as the most prominent
gene. Embryonic stage E11.5 was selected because we
had preliminary evidence that amplifications occur during
stages of brain development. Using FISH analysis we were
able to confirm amplification of TRP53 on a cryosection
from a mouse embryo at stage E11.5 (Figure 8a–8c).
TRP53 amplifications were detectable in the developing
brain, particularly in cells of the metencephalic part of the
rhombencephalon and in cells of the cephalic mesenchyme
(Figure 8d, 8e).

Simultaneous gene amplification and GFAP
expression
Immune fluorescence was used to analyze the
differentiation of neurosphere cells to glial lineage cells
by simultaneous analysis of nestin and GFAP. As shown
in Figure 6a neurosphere cells expressed nestin only. As
shown in Figure 6b differentiation induced neurosphere
cells expressed GFAP and showed a decreased nestin
expression. To analyze a possible association between
gene amplification and differentiation, we performed
simultaneous FISH-analysis and immune fluorescence
staining with an antibody against the astrocyte marker
protein GFAP. Mesencephalon E14 neurosphere cells
that were differentiation-induced for 2 days, showed
amplifications for BAC RP23–421E11 containing FZR1
and BAC RP23–235I21 containing C1QL1 and GFAP. The

DISCUSSION
Gene amplification during differentiation was
recently detected in human neural progenitor cells [5].
Here we report a similar complex amplification pattern
in mouse neural progenitor cells during differentiation.
Although gene amplifications were mainly an attribute

six gene loci on nuclei from differentiation induced mesencephalon E14 neurosphere cells. FZR1 (RP23–421E11) (pink) gene amplification
was confirmed in 2-day differentiation induced cells and normal copy number of the control probe from the same chromosome ANO4
(RP23–279E23) (green) (a, b). FZR1 (pink) amplifications detected in 3-day differentiation induced cells frequently revealed an increase
of fluorescence signals at only one of the corresponding loci (c). CDK4 (RP23- 432F11) (pink) gene amplification in 3-day differentiation

with normal copy number of control gene COX10 (RP23–40P10) (pink) from the same chromosome (e). C1QL1 (RP23–235I12) (pink)

of tumor cells and drug resistant cells in humans, there
were many reports of programmed gene amplification
during development of amphibians and flies. Interestingly
polyploidization in mammalian cells gains more and
more attention in respect to its physiological significance
and distribution [12]. The reasons for polyploidy were
manifold and sometimes achieved by multiple rounds of
replication without entering mitosis (endocycles). The
occurrence of endocycles is widespread in nature and
points to an ancient and practical innovation [13]. In
somatic follicle cells of Drosophila polyploid cells cease
their genome replication and start to endoreplicate four
specific genomic regions resulting in gene amplifications
[14]. In the present study TGF-β–differentiation induced
SFME cells revealed 89 amplified chromosome regions
by array CGH analysis. Interestingly, FCS differentiation
induced SFME cells show only 13 amplified chromosome
regions. These results strongly argue against a simple
artifact of DNA preparation or replication timing. In
both scenarios one would expect genomic imbalances
throughout the genome and not on specific chromosomes.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

As shown in other studies, a wavy CGH pattern was even
found after increased protein digestion, further indicating
that the wavy pattern that indicate genomic imbalances
was not due to preparation effects [7]. In addition, it is
very unlikely that early and late replication effects were
responsible for the wavy pattern of amplifications in our
experiments since we investigated a very heterogeneous
cell population. This effect may apply to rapidly
proliferating cells but not to a non-synchronized cell
population during differentiation. Although induction
of differentiation might have a synchronization effect
we did not find an amplification pattern indicative of
synchronization. The simultaneous analysis of multiple
amplified regions revealed a very heterogeneous pattern
of amplifications and co-amplifications that argues against
synchronization. In a synchronized cell population one
would expect a similar frequency for cells to be involved
in amplification of a given gene. We found that the
amplification frequency varies between 5% for TRP53
and 33% for C1QL1 and GFAP. One would also expect
that cells with amplifications would have the same regions

amplified and/or co-amplified. However we have cells
with and without co-amplifications. One would further
expect an almost similar intensity of the fluorescence
signals for the amplified gene. Here, we have a great
variation of fluorescence signal intensities between cells
with an amplified gene.
As shown in Supplementary Figure S1 we found
amplifications and an increased wavy pattern in SFME
cells freshly seeded on fibronectin and cultivated for one
day. Although still proliferating the SFME cells cultivated
for 4 d revealed a more flattened pattern. This observation
suggests an early influence mediated by fibronectin on
differentiation-induced amplifications.
Interestingly, we found that 50% of the amplified
mouse chromosome regions detected after TGF-β
differentiation induction overlap with amplified
chromosomal regions detectable in human neural
progenitor cells upon differentiation induction for 2 and
5 days. The overlap of the amplified chromosome regions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

between both cell types points to a basic and conserved
mechanism used by cells during differentiation. Out of the
large number of genes that were affected by amplification,
we would like to draw attention to the following groups of
genes. Many amplified genes were involved in replication
initiation or endocycling, including GINS genes, POLA2,
PRIM1, CDH1, FZR, and genes from the CST (Cdc13Stn1-Ten1) complex. Recently, a study reported that
human CST complex is involved in replication restart
[15]. Amplification of TP53 in human and mouse neural
progenitor cells is consistent with previous observation
that p53 expression might prevent neuronal terminal
differentiation in neuroblasts [16].
There are several lines of evidence pointing to gene
amplification as a mechanism to elevate the abundance
of mRNAs and proteins in mammalian cells specifically
during differentiation. Gurok et al 2004 investigated the
mRNA expression pattern of mouse neurosphere cells
differentiated by BDNF for 1, 2 and 4 days [17]. More

than 50% of the up-regulated genes in the study by Gurok
were localized in chromosome regions that we found
amplified in our present study. The amplified regions
included 3 genes that showed the highest up-regulation
of expression including 6330403K07 RIKEN cDNA,
complement component 3 and complement component
4 cDNAs. Regarding the protein level we showed that
amplification of the chromosome region harboring the
GFAP gene was associated with high GFAP expression
detectable by immune fluorescence as early as 12 hours
after FCS differentiation induction. Likewise, we found
high GFAP expression in TGF-ß differentiation induced
SFME cells. In mesencephalon neurosphere cells we
confirmed GFAP amplification and GFAP expression using
simultaneous FISH and immunefluorescence analysis after
2-day differentiation induction. Considering the biological
effects of the amplifications, one has to bear in mind that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

array-CGH is likely to miss chromosome regions that are
amplified during differentiation. Since the array-CGH
data stem from a mixed population of cells, this method
indentified only amplifications that are present in at least
5% of the cells. In addition, array-CGH analysis does not
show if a given amplified domain has the same extend in
the cells that harbor this amplification. Thus, the in vitro
array-CGH analysis can only be a first step towards a
complete picture of gene amplifications in differentiating
cells. We used fluorescence-in-situ hybridization on
differentiation induced SFME cells and mesencephanlon
derived primary neuronal progenitor cells to validate
our CGH-analysis. Six chromosome regions randomly
selected from the amplified chromosome regions were
confirmed in our in-situ hybridization experiments. The
FISH experiments showed several cases with a sprinkled
highly dense pattern of fluorescence signals, which is

probably due to amplification on double minutes or even
smaller units like episomes. As for the amplification
mechanism, the process underlying the amplification in
normal differentiating cells is likely different from the
amplification mechanism assumed for mammalian tumor
cells. The breakage-fusion-bridge-cycle model that may
explain gene amplifications in tumor cells is not able to
explain the tremendous increase in gene copy numbers
observed in differentiating cells within 12–48 hours. The
observed increase points to a mechanism independent
from mitosis and appears more related to the endocycling
and amplification mechanism described in Drosophila. A
recent study reports amplified and under-replicated regions
caused by repression of replication initiation and fork
progression in Drosophila [18].
Our in vivo results on gene amplifications in a
specific mouse embryonic stage provide further evidence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that developmental gene amplification is not restricted
to amphibians and flies. The tissue section contains a
heterogeneous mixture of cells at different time points of
the differentiation process including stem cells, progenitor
cells and completely differentiated cells. We showed
that gene amplification is present in specific cells of the
developing mouse brain at stage E11.5 of embryonic
development. We assume that amplification occurs in cells
in the process of differentiation. Notably, fluorescence in
situ hybridizations was done on tissue sections with nonrepetitive hybridization probes. Under these conditions
signal detection is complicated by the thickness of the
section and the possibility that nuclei are cut in two. This
may cause possible loss of one of the signals of the two
gene copies. Higher numbers of gene copies as result of an
amplification process are, however, likely to be detected by
strong hybridization signals even under these experimental

conditions. Independent of these technical issues, it
remains to be seen to what extend gene amplifications
may be found beyond the analyzed stage, genes and cell
types. Published array-CGH data of previous studies
on haploid embryonic stem cells, murine iPS or tissues
containing differentiating cells show a striking similar
wavy CGH pattern that we found in our experiments. As
addressed above, the wavy pattern appears to result neither
from short protein digestion nor simply from replication
timing. Throughout our studies, samples from murine or
human neural stem cells were processed the same way
and amplifications were detectable at various time points
during differentiation. We are aware that our threshold
setting is below the setting used in other studies, but
mixed populations of cells with only small number of cells
harboring amplifications require this setting to allow for
amplification detection. In conclusion we need a rethinking
on the genomic stability of stem cells. It is very unlikely
that amplification as a powerful mean to up-regulate
genes was lost during evolution from amphibians and flies
towards mammals and only reinvented by tumor cells.
Stem cells during differentiation might represent the link
to explain the appearance of gene amplifications during
tumor development.

differentiation induced for 2 d and 3 d. All experiments
were done with neural stem and progenitor cells in P1 or
P2. Cells differentiating for 3 d were cultured for 24 h in
proliferation medium containing bFGF and EGF prior to
differentiation induction. Culturing for 24 h in proliferation
medium with bFGF and EGF is recommended by the
manufacturers to stimulate progenitor cell proliferation.

Array preparation, hybridization and detection
Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously
[5] and mouse genomic DNA from Clontech was used as
control DNA. NimbleGen 3x720K mouse whole genome
array hybridization was performed with the certified full
service of NimbleGen provided by ImaGenes Berlin,
Germany. Array data were deposited in GEO (GSE35523).

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
BAC clones were taken from the RP-11 (http://
www.chori.org/bacpac/) libraries of the Welcome Trust
Sanger Institute and available from ImaGenes GmbH,
Germany.
BAC probes for C1QL1 and S1PR5 were directly
labeled using the High Prime Labeling System (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). BAC-DNA (1
μg) was labeled with Cyanine-3-dCTP (Cy3) (pink
fluorescence signals) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Additional BAC probes were either labeled
with Alexa-488-dCTP (green fluorescence signals)
or with Alexa-594-dCTP (pink fluorescence signals)
using the FISHTag DNA labeling Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For multiple amplification
analysis three BAC probes were labeled with Alexa-555dCTP, with Alexa-488-dCTP and with Alexa-594-dCTP.
Differentially labeled probe DNAs (60 ng) were
precipitated in the presence of mouse Cot-1 DNA. Samples
were resuspended in hybridization mix (50% formamide,
2xSSPE, 10% dextrane sulphate and 4% SDS).

METHODS
Cell culture and differentiation
SFME cells (CRL-9392™) were obtained from
ATCC as cryopreserved culture and were cultivated in
DMEM:F12 Medium supplemented with bovine insulin
(0.01 mg/ml), human transferrin (0.01 mg/ml), chemically
defined lipids (1%), sodium selenite (10 nM) and mouse
EGF (50 ng/ml). Cells were seeded on fibronectin
coated cultureware and allowed to grow for 18 h prior to
differentiation induction with TGF-β. SFME cells were
differentiation induced using above supplemented ATCC
DMEM:F12 Medium containing TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for
24 h or DMEM:F12 supplemented with FCS for 12 h.
For fibronectin control experiments cells were
grown an additional 4 d and 1 d on fibronectin before
DNA isolation. Cells cultured in the absence of fibronectin
formed spheres and served as non-differentiated controls.
Mouse Ventral Mesencephalon E14 neurospheres
were obtained as P1 cryopreserved neurospheres from
STEMCELL Technologies. These neurospheres contain
neural stem and progenitor cells. Cells were cultured
in complete NeuroCultTM NSC proliferation medium
supplemented with rhEGF (20 ng/ml). As undifferentiated
controls those P1 neural stem and progenitor cells were
cultivated on laminin coated glass slides for 2 d.
Differentiation was induced according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using NeuroCultTM NSC
differentiation medium without cytokines and with laminin
or poly-D-lysine/laminin coated glass slides. Cells were

Fluorescence in situ hybridization using
SFME cells
SFME interphase nuclei were fixed using Carnoy’s
fixative (methanol ice acetic acid). Nuclei were dropped
on clean glass slides. Slides were RNase treated (100 μg/
ml RNaseA in 2 × SSC) for 30 minutes at 37°C and pepsin
treated (0.005% in 0.01 M HCl at 37°C) for 10 minutes.
Postfixation was performed using 1% formaldehyde/1x
PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Labeled BAC probes were applied to the slides and
denatured for 2 min at 80°C. Hybridization was carried out
in a humid chamber at 37°C for 16 h. Post hybridization
washes were performed in 50% formamide/2 × SSPE
(4 × 5 minutes; 45°C) followed by 0.1 × SSPE (3 × 5
minutes) at 60°C. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(4’,6’-Diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1 μg/ml in PBS)
