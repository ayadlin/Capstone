ABSTRACT:
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a critical cell cycle regulator, has been identified
as a potential target in osteosarcoma (OS). 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2
(15d-PGJ2), a prostaglandin derivative, has shown its anti-tumor activity by inducing
apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inactivation of v-akt, a
murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog, (AKT) in cancer cells. In the study analyzing
its effects on arthritis, 15d-PGJ2 mediated shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via
protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of PLK1. In this study, the cytotoxic
effect and mechanism underlying 15d-PGJ2 effects against OS were explored using
OS cell lines. 15d-PGJ2 induced significant G2/M arrest, and exerted time- and dosedependent cytotoxic effects against all OS cell lines. Western blot analysis showed
that both AKT and PKA-PLK1 were down-regulated in OS cell lines after treatment
with 15d-PGJ2. In addition, transfection of constitutively active AKT or PLK1 partially
rescued cells from 15d-PGJ2-induced apoptosis, suggesting crucial roles for both
pathways in the anti-cancer effects of 15d-PGJ2. Moreover, ROS generation was found

l-cysteine. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK partially rescued 15d-PGJ2 cytotoxicity. Thus,
ROS-mediated JNK activation may contribute to apoptosis through down-regulation of the
p-Akt and PKA-PLK1 pathways. 15d-PGJ2 is a potential therapeutic agent for OS, exerting
cytotoxicity mediated through both AKT and PKA-PLK1 inhibition, and these results form
the basis for further analysis of its role in animal studies and clinical applications.

INTRODUCTION

been explored in cancer. Since PLK1 has been identified
as a potential target of OS, the role of 15d-PGJ2 in the
treatment of OS deserves further investigation. In this
study, we demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 could exert a
cytotoxic effect on OS cell lines via a ROS-mediated dual
inhibition of AKT and the cell cycle.

Primary bone tumors account for 0.2% of all
malignancies. Osteosarcoma (OS) is the major tumor
type [1]. Sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery
and adjuvant chemotherapy provide a of 5-year overall
survival of 60−70% in patients with localized disease [24]. However, 40−50% of patients with initially localized
disease develop recurrence during treatment [5,6], and less
than 20% of newly diagnosed cases present with metastatic
disease [3,7]. Most of these patients will eventually die of
the disease due to refractoriness to therapy [2].
Previous studies have revealed several genetic
mechanisms in OS tumorigenesis, including dysfunction
of tumor suppressor mechanisms, such as cell cycle
regulatory genes (e.g., tumor protein 53 [TP53],
retinoblastoma 1 [RB1] and mouse double minute
2 homolog [MDM2]) [8-10] as well as novel tumor
suppressor genes (e.g., limbic system-associated
membrane protein [LSAMP]) [11-13]. In addition,
telomere dysfunction [14,15], dysregulation of cell death
and cytokine pathways [16,17] and upregulation of ezrin
(EZR) have been reported in metastatic OS [18,19].
However, genetic complexity is a hallmark of high-grade
OS, and currently, no ideal target has been identified.
Recently, two independent groups have identified
polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine/threonine kinase that
regulates many stages of mitosis and maintains genomic
stability [20], as a potential target for OS treatment,
using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries in lentiviral
vectors for screening of protein kinases [21,22]. In
addition, previous studies have demonstrated the potential
oncogenic role of PLK1 [23-26]. Therefore, inhibition of
PLK1 could represent an effective treatment for OS.
15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has
gained attention as a potential cancer treatment because
of its unique anti-tumor activity. Earlier studies showed
that it could significantly inhibit cell growth and induce
apoptosis in cancer cells through activation of PPARγ
[27-29]. However, recent evidence indicates that its
cytotoxicity is largely PPARγ-independent, and is closely
related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [3032], with subsequent inhibition of critical pathways, such
as v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT)
[33-37]. Interestingly, in arthritis, 15d-PGJ2 mediated
shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via protein kinase
A (PKA)-dependent regulation of PLK1 [38]. However,
the role of 15d-PGJ2 in modulating PLK1 has never

RESULTS
15d-PGJ2 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis
of OS cell lines
To evaluate the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the growth
of OS cells, three OS cell lines (MG63, SaOS2, U2OS)
were treated with various concentrations of 15d-PGJ2
for a range of time. Cell viability was assessed by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) assay. As shown in Figure
1A and 1B, 15d-PGJ2 significantly inhibited the growth
of all three OS cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent
manner.
We then investigated whether 15d-PGJ2 induced
apoptosis of OS cell lines. After treatment of all three
OS cell lines with 15d-PGJ2 at different dose level and
durations, cells were co-stained with annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI). 15d-PGJ2 significantly induced
apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Figure
1C and 1D, respectively). Both these studies indicated
that 15d-PGJ2 exerted a cytotoxic effect, inhibiting OS
cell growth.

15d-PGJ2 induced significant G2/M arrest in OS
cell lines
Because PLK1 is a cell cycle regulatory protein, we
next examined the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the cell cycle
in OS cells in vitro. After treatment with 15d-PGJ2 for 72
h, increased G2/M DNA content was observed in all three
OS cell lines (Figure 2), indicating that 15d-PGJ2 could
induce a significant G2/M arrest in OS cells.

15d-PGJ2 activated ERK but down-regulated
both AKT and PKA-PLK1 pathways

AKT or PLK1 expression was confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Figure 4A and 4C). Expression of constitutively
active AKT or PLK1 partially protected cells from
apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ2 (Figure 4B and 4D).
These findings indicate that down-regulation of both AKT
and PLK1 plays a functional role in the death of OS cells
resulting from treatment with 15d-PGJ2.

Since both the PI3K/AKT and PKA-PLK1 signaling
pathways have been implicated as targets of 15d-PGJ2, we
investigated the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on AKT expression
and phosphorylation as well as changes in expression of
members of the PKA-PLK1 pathway. As shown in Figure
3, 15d-PGJ2 induced ERK activation, as reported by
previous studies [30,39]. On the other hand, 15d-PGJ2
induced a significant time-dependent down-regulation of
AKT and p-AKT in U2OS and Saos2 cells, and, to a lesser
extent, in MG63 cells. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 dramatically
down-regulated total and phospho- PKA, PLK1, and
CDC25 levels in all three cell lines. Cleavage of PARP
was also seen after 24–48 h of treatment (Figure 3).
Thus, 15d-PGJ2 repressed both the AKT and PKA-PLK1
pathways, thereby inducing apoptosis.

15d-PGJ2-induced ROS generation in OS cell
lines, and cytotoxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 on OS cell
lines are ROS-dependent
ROS generation was considered the major cytotoxic
mechanism of 15d-PGJ2 in tumor cell death [32,37].
Therefore, we measured ROS levels in U2OS cell lines
exposed to 15d-PGJ2. 15d-PGJ2 induced production of
ROS in U2OS cells after 2 h, peaking at 3-4 h (Figure
5A). To investigate a functional relationship between
ROS generation and the cytotoxic effect of 15d-PGJ2,
U2OS cells were exposed to 15d-PGJ2 in the absence
or presence of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant.
As shown in Figure 5B, reduced suppression of the AKT
and PKA-PLK1 pathways, as well as PARP degradation
was observed in cells treated with 15d-PGJ2 and NAC.
In addition, co-treatment of cells with NAC reduced
15d-PGJ2-induced ROS production (Figure 5C) and
ameliorated the 15d-PGJ2-induced cell cycle arrest

Both AKT and PKA-PLK1 pathways are critical
targets of 15d-PGJ2
To explore the functional significance of AKT and
PKA-PLK1 pathway suppression in 15d-PGJ2–mediated
cell death, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with a
constitutively active AKT or PLK1 expression constructs
as well as empty vector controls. Constitutively active

(Figure 5D) and apoptosis (Figure 5E). Thus, 15d-PGJ2
induced ROS generation in OS cell lines, and the cytotoxic
effects of 15d-PGJ2 on OS cell lines were mediated by
ROS-dependent down-regulation of the PKA-PLK1 and
AKT pathways.

proliferation by inducing apoptosis. This finding is in
agreement with the results of previous studies of 15d-PGJ2
in other cell lines [28,37]. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic mechanism of
15d-PGJ2–induced apoptosis remained unclear. The
present study shows that 15d-PGJ2 induced generation
of ROS and activated JNK in OS cells, resulting in the
down-regulation of the AKT and PLK1 pathways with
subsequent apoptosis.
Several pathways, such as nuclear factor kappalight-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [40-42],
hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF2α) [43], and AKT [3337], have been identified as targets for 15d-PGJ2-induced
cytotoxicity. AKT is a critical regulator of diverse cellular
functions [44], and ROS may activate AKT through
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) inactivation
[45]. However, our study disclosed that 15d-PGJ2 downregulated AKT in OS cells with resultant apoptosis, which
is consistent with that of previous studies in other cancer
types [34-37].
More importantly, we found that the PKA-PLK1CDC25 pathway is a target of 15d-PGJ2 on OS cells.
A previous study showed that 15d-PGJ2 inhibited PKA
in renal proximal epithelial cells [40]. In addition, Zhu
et al. [38] showed that exogenous PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2
diminished the viability of human chondrocytes through
down-regulation of the PKA-PLK1 pathway [38]. These
earlier studies prompted us to explore the possibility of
targeting this pathway by 15d-PGJ2 in cancer. In this
study, we demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 down-regulated
the PKA-PLK1-CDC25 pathway in OS cell lines. We
also showed that constitutive activation of AKT or PLK1
partially reversed the apoptosis induced by 15d-PGJ2.
These data confirmed the important role of both AKT and
PLK1 in 15d-PGJ2–mediated cytotoxicity of cancer cells.

15d-PGJ2 induced ROS-mediated c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (JNK) activation contributes
to apoptosis through down-regulation of the AKT
and PKA-PLK1 pathways
Studies suggest that JNK plays an important role in
ROS-induced apoptosis [30,37]. To investigate whether
15d-PGJ2–induced ROS leads to the activation of JNK
in OS cells, we examined the phosphorylation state of
JNK in OS cells treated with 15d-PGJ2. As shown in
Figure 6A, 15d-PGJ2 treatment significantly increased
the phosphorylation of JNK. Furthermore, pretreatment
with JNK inhibitor, SP600125, for 1 h could prevent the
phosphorylation of JNK caused by 15d-PGJ2, and block
15d-PGJ2-induced down-regulation of AKT as well as
PKA-PLK1-CDC25 (Figure 6B). SP600125 also inhibited
15d-PGJ2–induced apoptosis (Figure 6C). These results
indicate that ROS-mediated JNK activation may in part
contribute to apoptosis through down-regulation of AKT
and PLK1.

ROS has been implicated in several oncogenic
pathways, such as promoting tumor growth [46],
angiogenesis [45], mutagenesis [47,48], and drug
resistance [49,50]. On the other hand, ROS-mediated
cytotoxicity has also been identified as an important
mechanism in some anti-cancer agents [51,52]. Several
studies have linked ROS generation with 15d-PGJ2–
induced apoptosis [31,32]. In this study, 15d-PGJ2

induced ROS generation in OS cell lines. Moreover, the
anti-oxidant, NAC, could reverse the cytotoxic and cell
cycle inhibition effects of 15d-PGJ2, confirming the

MATERIALS AND METHODS

apoptosis of cancer cell lines.
A previous study suggested that activation of JNK
through ROS generation is important for 15d-PGJ2induced apoptosis [30]. To investigate this hypothesis, we
used immunoblot analysis to examine the expression of
p-JNK after treatment with 15d-PGJ2. 15d-PGJ2 treatment
activated JNK, and SP600125 pretreatment partially
inhibited 15d-PGJ2–induced apoptosis. Taken together,
these data suggest that activation of JNK through ROS
may contribute to down-regulation of AKT and PLK1 to
lethality.
In this study, we did not explore other possible
mechanisms of 15d-PGJ2-induced cytotoxicity, such as
the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, we cannot exclude the
possibility that 15d-PGJ2 also inhibits NF-κB in OS. Also,
we did not analyze the mechanism of 15d-PGJ2-induced
down-regulation of PKA-PLK1-CDC25. Previous studies
have shown that 15d-PGJ2 down-regulated AKT at the
transcriptional level [35,37]. However, in a recent study
analyzing 15d-PGJ2 target proteins, heat shock protein 90
(Hsp90) was found to be one of the targets [53]. Thus,
it is also possible that 15d-PGJ2 may inhibit Hsp90 with
subsequent degradation of PKA-PLK1-CDC25.
	 In summary, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the growth
and induced apoptosis of OS cells. 15d-PGJ2 generated
ROS, activated JNK, and suppressed the AKT and PLK1
pathways. These results suggested that 15d-PGJ2 may be
of therapeutic importance in the treatment of OS, and form
the basis for further analysis of its role in animal studies
and clinical applications.

Cell lines and reagents
Three OS cell lines, U2OS, MG63 and SaOS2,
were chosen as our in vitro study model. They were kept
in the DMEM or IMDM base media with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). 15d-PGJ2 was purchased from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA, USA). The following antibodies were
used for immunoblotting: PKA C-α (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA; #4782; 1:1000); PLK1 (Cell Signaling
#4513; 1:1000); AKT (Cell Signaling #9272; 1:2000);
p-AKT (Cell Signaling #9271; 1:1000); Cdc25c(5H9)
(Cell Signaling #4688; 1:1000); P-cdc25c (Ser216) (Cell
Signaling #4901; 1:1000); PARP (Cell Signaling #9542;
1:1000), and actin (Abs 24-100; 1:50000). The anti-8hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) antibody (Santa
Cruz, #sc-66036; 1:200) and anti-mouse conjugated
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch West Grove, PA; 1:400) were used for
8OHdG detection.

Analysis of cell viability
Cells were seeded in triplicate 96-well plates in
100 μL complete media at a density of 2000-20000
cells per well. On the next day, drugs were added at
different concentrations with variable times. Then, 10
μL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to the
wells and the plates were incubated for an additional 4
h at 37°C. A detergent solution (200 μL/well) was next
added and mixed thoroughly to dissolve the dark-blue
crystals. Absorbance of the converted dye was measured
spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader (Vmax,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 570 nm (test)
and 650 nm (reference). Cell survival was calculated as
percentage of MTT inhibition as follows: % survival =
(mean experimental absorbance/ mean control absorbance)
× 100 [54].

Statement of translational relevance
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key component
in cell cycle regulation, and has been identified as a
potential target of osteosarcoma (OS). On the other hand,
15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) has been
found to mediate shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via
protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of PLK1. In
the current study, we explored the cytotoxic effect and
mechanism of 15d-PGJ2 in an in vitro model of OS. In
OS cell lines, 15d-PGJ2 induced a significant cytotoxic
effect, including G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the
cytotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2 resulted from ROS-mediated,
JNK-dependent down-regulation of both the AKT and
PKA-PLK1 pathways in OS. The current study revealed
a unique mechanism of 15d-PGJ2 against OS, and its
efficacy in xenograft models and clinical usages deserved
further exploration.

Apoptosis assessment by annexin V staining
Drug-induced apoptosis was measured using
annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Annexin V-FITC)
and PI co-staining using an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis
detection kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). After
15d-PGJ2 or DMSO treatment, cells were washed and
resuspended in 100 μL staining solution (containing
Annexin V-FITC and PI in a HEPES buffer). After
incubation in dark and at room temperature for 15 min,
cells were diluted in 400 μL of 1x binding buffer, and

stress [56], was measured as previously described [57],
with modification. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and
harvested, washed twice with PBS and fixed by 1%
paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The fixed cells
were then washed with PBS, permeabilized by adding
0.1% Triton X100 for 15 min at room temperature,
and washed with PBS again. Next, a blocking solution
consisting of 1% BSA in PBS was added for 1 h at 37°C
with gentle shaking, and cells were incubated with anti8OHdG antibody for  1 h at 37°C after washing. Cells
were washed again with PBS, and anti-mouse conjugated
FITC antibody was then added and incubated for 1 h. Flow
cytometry was used to detect the immunofluorescence.

Cell cycle analysis
After 15d-PGJ2 or DMSO treatment, OS cells were
trypsinized and fixed in 99% ethanol at -20°C for 2 h,
washed and re-suspended in 420 μL PBS. Subsequently,
samples were first incubated with RNase A (Sigma) (50
μL of a 10 mg/mL solution) at 37°C for 30 min, and then
PI (20 μL of a 0.2 mg/mL solution) at room temperature
for 10 min. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry
using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson & Co.) and
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson & Co.) [55].

Transfection of the Myr-Akt or PLK1 vector
In order to explore the critical function of AKT
or PLK1 in 15d-PGJ2-induced cytotoxicity, U2OS cells
(7×105) were transfected with either 8 μg of myc-tagged
myristoylated Akt expression vector (pCDEST-myrAkt)
or pWZL NeoMyrFlag PLK1 expression vector or their
corresponding empty vector (pCS2+ or pWZL-Neo-MyrFlag-DEST) (all purchased from Addgene, Cambridge,
MA, USA) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s procedure.
After transfection, cells were cultured in 10% FBS–
supplemented IMDM for 24 h and then subjected to 0.1%
DMSO or 15d-PGJ2 treatment.
