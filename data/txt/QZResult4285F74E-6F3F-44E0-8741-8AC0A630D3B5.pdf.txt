Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their
Use in Cell-Based Therapies
Helena Motaln, PhD1,2; Cristian Schichor, MD3; and Tamara T. Lah, PhD1,2

The human population is increasingly facing various diseases, including types of cancer, that cannot be cured with
conventional drugs. Advanced drug targeting of tumor cells is also often impossible when treating highly invasive
and infiltrative tumors such as glioblastoma or pulmonary cancer, because of tumor cells’ high migration and invasiveness. Pluripotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been extensively studied, and strategies are
being proposed for treating ‘‘incurable’’ cancers and injury/disease-affected organs. Because of their own intrinsic
properties, involving homing and immunomodulatory potency, hMSCs could be used as an excellent cell/drug delivery vehicle in those cell-based therapies. Their unprecedented use has been shadowed, however, by their spontaneous transformation, which links them to cancer-initiating cells during tumor development. How malignant initiation
proceeds in vivo, and what are the exact characteristics of the cancer-initiating cells, still remain to be investigated.
In the present review, the authors summed up the most recent knowledge about hMSC characteristics, their
malignant transformation, and outlined the possibilities of their safe use in novel cell-based therapies. Cancer

Cells to be used in cell-based regenerative therapies should display certain properties and have a broad differentiation
potential. Cells’ differentiation potency is their ability to differentiate into cell precursors of all 3 germ layers and extraembryonic structures. Pluripotent cells, for that matter, can differentiate into derivatives of all 3 germ layers, but are risky to
use for therapeutic administration; a donor-derived fetal stem cell tumor was observed in a patient with ataxia telangiectasia after transplantation.1 Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells, which are an in vitro equivalent of pluripotent cells
residing in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage embryo, face tremendous ethical issues that are stalling their research.
For this reason, isolation and characterization of pluripotent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as putative adult
analogues of human embryonic stem cells is of such importance. hMSCs are present in different tissues and have a potential to differentiate into numerous cell types.2-4 The ease of hMSC isolation from adult tissues and the fact they are not
ethically restricted make them attractive candidates for use in cell/gene therapy for tissue regeneration and anticancer treatments. The characteristics that speak for and against hMCS use shall be addressed in the present review.
Isolation Efficiency and Origin-Dependent Growth of hMSC
Human mesenchymal stem cell niches reside in various tissues, from which different amounts of hMSCs can be isolated.
With 100% efficiency they can be isolated from bone marrow (BM) aspirates, adipose tissues, and umbilical cords,5
whereas from fresh cord blood the isolation efficiency is only 30%5 to 63%.6,7 The lowest 19.5% isolation efficiency was
determined for cryopreserved cord blood samples.7 Recently, amniotic membrane became an attractive source of hMSCs,
because this fetal tissue is discarded without any ethical issues, gives the greatest yields of hMSCs, and is devoid of vasculature that causes hematopoietic cell contamination.8 Improved hMSC isolation protocols and optimized culture/storage/
transport conditions5,9 allow the isolation of hMSCs from almost any identified source. Nevertheless, the growth rate of
hMSCs seems to be origin dependent,10 and interclonal variability exists among the hMSC clones derived from the same

Figure 2. Proliferation response of human mesenchymal stem
cells (hMSCs) and glioma cells in cocultures is shown. The
proliferation index of hMSCs was defined as a ratio of (a)
positive Ki-67 nuclei versus (b) the total number of hMSCs
per vision field. (c) Glioblastoma cells U251 and their conditioned media (CM) significantly increased (P < .05) the proliferation index in 2 hMSC clones, whereas (d) hMSCs and their
CM significantly decreased (P > .05) the proliferation index of
U251 cells.

high interindividual variability in their growth rate. (a-e) Four
different clones of hMSCs derived from the bone marrow of

span,11,12 as also demonstrated for the 4 BM hMSC
clones (Fig. 1). Novel devices containing a nonwoven fabric filter that selectively traps BM hMSCs by bone marrow
affinity, not cell size, may give purer hMSC cultures with
high expansion potential.13
Proliferation/expansion potential of hMSCs is
affected by in vitro culture, which results in changed cell/
culture morphology. That is, under established in vitro
conditions, hMSCs grow as a monolayer, but when cultured in hypoxic atmosphere—a condition found in
many tumors in vivo—they continue to proliferate during
cell density increase and display a 30-fold higher expansion rate.14 This could be used when treating chronically
hypoxic tumor tissues, where even low numbers of

2520

hMSCs present may display a beneficiary effect because of
their proliferative activity. With scalable automated cell
culture platforms, it is possible to optimize the expansion
process and conduct a factorial screening (seeding density,
serum concentrations, media quantity, and incubation
time) of different hMSC responses (such as cell number,
gene expression, STRO-1, CD105, and CD71
increase).15 Addressing differences accompanying hMSC
growth under hypoxic conditions may reveal the true
characteristics of hMSCs and their putative derivatives,
tumor stem cells, which are causative for cancer development and persistence.16
In addition, the proliferation of hMSCs could be
increased by treated adhesion surface17 or with growth
factor-supplemented hMSC culture media.18 Collagen
I-coated scaffolds, in addition to improving cell attachment, enhance proliferation up to 3.17 Moreover,
hMSC proliferation increases in cocultures with glioma
cells or their conditioned medium (Fig. 2).19 In contrast,
the addition of recombinant protein wingless-type mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV) integration site family
member 3A (Wnt3a)20 and growth factors transforming
growth factor (TGF)b1 and TGFb221 decreases hMSC
proliferation. hMSC proliferation ceases similarly during
prolonged in vitro culture, because of increased

endogenous expression of TGFb, TGFb-R1, and
Smad3.21 Systemic quality engineering approaches are
essential for the design of regulated cell therapy manufacturing processes because of their focus on identifying the
sources and the control of in vitro culture variations.
Immunophenotype and hMSC Differentiation
There is no single surface marker, but rather a panel of
surface markers that define hMSCs, derived from fresh
tissues or cryopreserved samples. Due to different hMSC
tissue sources, differences exist among these cells. Therefore, the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee
of the International Society for Cellular Therapy proposed 3 minimal criteria to define hMSC: 1) the ability to
adhere to plastic; 2) presence of >95% expression of
hMSC-specific antigen markers and >95% absence of
hematopoietic/endothelial marker expression; and 3) the
differentiation of the hMSCs into osteoblasts, adipocytes,
and chondroblasts in vitro.22 Thorough evaluation of
those criteria still does not rule out the heterogeneity of
hMSCs from different sources; however, detailed description of cell markers and behavior allows us to decide
which cell source to use for a certain therapy in a certain
individual.
In detail, hMSCs are negative for 3 hematopoietic
markers, CD14, CD34, CD45, and antigens CD4, CD8,
CD11a, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD25, CD31 (endothelial marker), CD33, CD49b, CD49d, CD49f, CD50,
CD62E, CD62L, CD62P, CD80, CD86, CD106,
CD117, cadherin V, glycophorin A, human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-DR, and HLA class II.3,8,23-25 Conversely,
hMSC are positive for CD10, CD13, CD29 (b1-integrin), CD44, CD49e (a5-integrin), CD54 (ICAM-1),
CD58, CD71, CD73 (SH3), CD90 (Thy-1), CD105
(SH2/endoglin), CD146, CD166, CD271, vimentin,
cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, nestin, and von Willebrand
factor. They weakly express HLA class I and CD123, and
have a variable expression of FLK1 (KDR), CD133/1,
and CD133/2.3,8,23-25 With the refinement of isolation
methods, a new ‘‘perivascular niche’’ of hMSCs was identified recently and defined as a common stem cell microenvironment for resident hMSC-like cell populations in
different tissues.26 The hMSCs from the perivascular
niche display also a STRO-1 marker,26 which classifies
them for a more primitive hMSC subset of the bulk tissue
hMSCs.27,28 A new concept has emerged that a high-quality primitive subpopulation of hMSCs from different
tissues may actually all originate from the perivascular
niche.26-28 The origin-dependent level of surface antigen

expression in hMSCs is still higher in early passages than
in late passages,12 suggesting that the hMSC pool within
an organism probably consists of a heterogeneous hMSC
population.
Despite morphological and immunophenotypical
similarities, hMSCs from different origins differ regarding
their differentiation potential. BM hMSCs can differentiate along all known differentiation pathways.3 In contrast,
umbilical cord blood (CB) hMSCs and umbilical cord
(UC) hMSCs display a reduced sensitivity to undergoing
adipogenic differentiation,6,7 although they can differentiate into adipocytes.29 During adipogenesis, hMSCs’
continuous secretion of interleukin (IL)-1b inhibits collagen II, aggrecan, and matrix metalloproteinase-13 expression30 and induces IL-6 secretion by p38MAPK
activation.31 CB hMSCs’ lower adipogenic commitment
shows in the production of fewer and smaller lipid
vacuoles, compared with BM hMSCs or adipose tissue
(AT) hMSCs, whereas amniotic membrane hMSCs differentiate into advanced lipid-secreting aggregates.8 Independently of their origin, hMSCs’ adipogenic potential is
inversely related to the length of in vitro culture, and
sharply declines when hMSCs become senescent.32
Contrary, prolonged culturing increases their osteogenic
potential.12 hMSC in vitro expansion should therefore be
performed with limited passaging, to avoid changes in
cells’ differentiation ability.
In addition to differentiation pathways that define
hMSCs, they can differentiate into other cell types. Their
differentiation ability can be controlled by various means:
•

•

•

Media supplemented with growth factors, such as the
addition of 1 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 or 10 ng/mL of TGFb3 improves osteogenesis33 and
chondrogenesis, respectively.34 Similarly, a hepatogenic
protocol to predifferentiate hMSCs includes the successive addition of FGF-2, FGF-4, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor, nicotinamide,
oncostatin M, dexamethasone, and insulin-transferrinselenium.35
Microenvironment: hMSC coculture with other primary
cells (ie, liver cells) enhances hepatic transdifferentiation,36 and constant oxygen levels or hypoxic preconditioning enhances osteogenesis.37
Also, biomaterial surface coatings affect hMSC differentiation in a lineage-dependent manner,38 and biodegradable scaffolds do not act only as a temporary matrix for
cell migration, but have osteoinductive potential even
without osteogenic media stimulation.17

Moreover, some noncoding RNAs together with transcripts of unknown function (TUFs) affect transcriptional kinetics during hMSC differentiation.39
Finally, mechanotransduction40 and electrostimulation41
have a stimulating effect on hMSC differentiation as
well, by which the drawbacks of conditioned media
could be avoided.

Genetic Fingerprint and Cytokine Profiling
of hMSCs
With advanced gene expression analyses, it is possible to
characterize morphology changes of hMSCs. Transcriptome analysis from early and late passage hMSCs shows
significant alterations in the patterns of gene expression.42
Gene expression reflects a hierarchy that exists among
hMSCs32 by confirming the highest level of transcription
factor Oct-4 expression in amniotic membrane hMSCs.8
Oct-4 expression defines pluripotency of stem cells, and
always decreases during differentiation. A broad differentiation potential and Oct4 expression place amniotic
membrane hMSCs at the top of the differentiation potential hierarchy among all hMSCs.8 Second place in this hierarchy is occupied by CB hMSCs, which in turn have a
higher differentiation potential than BM hMSCs.29 Thus,
we believe that CB and amniotic membrane may in the
future present the optimal source of high-quality hMSCs,
where their heterogeneity may be made uniform by standardized protocols. Such high-quality hMSCs could be
preserved in human tissue banks and used for either autologous or allogeneic cell therapy when needed.
In each organ, there is a location or niche enriched
with tissue stem cells that resides within a subpopulation
of stromal cells, which are closely associated and control
the activity of stem cells. In niches, hMSCs secrete molecules to communicate and respond to other cell types. In
vitro, hMSCs secrete several cytokines, ILs, and growth
factors like epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating
peptide-78, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor, growth-related oncogene, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, oncostatin m
(OSM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-9, granulocyte chemotactic protein
2 (GCP-2), insulinlike growth factor-binding protein
(IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, interferon-inducible protein-10, macrophage-inhibiting factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-3a, osteoprotegerin,
pulmonary and activation regulated chemokine (PARC),
phosphatidylinositol glycan class F (PIGF), TGF-b2,

2522

TGF-b3, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1,
and TIMP-2.31 In addition to these, CB hMSCs also constitutively produce somatic cell-derived growth factor
(SCF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-11, IL-12, IL-15, stromal cellderived factor-1a, and hepatocyte growth factor,25 and after IL-1b stimulation, they secrete significantly more granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, SCF, and LIF.25 The
basal cytokine profile of hMSCs from different origins is
the same, differing only in concentration ranges. The cytokine secretion levels depend on hMSC morphology.43
Aggregated hMSCs or spheroids secrete up to 20 more
VEGF, FGF-b, angiogenin, procathepsin B, IL-11, and
bone morphogenetic protein type 2 compared with hMSC
monolayers.43 The enhanced/inhibited production of cytokines in vivo might lead to interaction with cells at the implantation site. Therefore, affecting this secretory crosstalk
would be recommended tool in regenerative medicine and
oncology, and needs to be addressed in further studies.
hMSC Proliferation Arrest and Senescence
Gradual shortening of the telomeres during a cell’s life
continues, until the presence of critically short telomeres
triggers a p53/Rb senescence pathway,10 which results in
proliferation arrest. Because of that, a normal human cell
can only divide 50 to 100 times in in vitro conditions.
hMSCs are no exception, with the telomere shortening
rate of 50 bp per population doubling.10,29 CB hMSC,
however, have slightly longer telomeres than other
hMSCs, and thus can be cultured for longer before they
senesce.25 Proliferation arrest in hMSCs results in senescence, which is described by the appearance of large senescent cells with flat shape, circumscribed nuclei, increased
lysosome compartment, and endogenous b-gal activity.12
These morphological changes are not restricted to the senescent stage only, but represent continuous alterations in
the course of hMSCs’ long-term culture.12
In senescent hMSCs, up-regulated genes are highly
over-represented (P < .0001) in the categories integral to
plasma membrane, receptor activity, cell adhesion,
vacuoles, and lysosomes,12 which coincides with the
enlargement of the plasma membrane during senescence.12,23 Significantly up-regulated genes in senescent
hMSCs are: human glycoprotein neuromedin B (NMB),
regeneration-associated muscle protease homolog
(RAMP), p16 (INK4A), p53, p53 apoptosis effector
related to PMP-22 (PERP), p21 (Waf1), lymphocyte antigen 96 (LY96), STAT1, and prion protein (PRNP).12,32
The expression levels of p16 (INK4A), Cdk inhibitor 2A,

hMSCs and Cell-Based Therapies/Motaln et al

plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1), and c-myc
genes steadily increase with hMSC population doubling.12,32 Presenescent and senescent hMSCs can therefore be distinguished from early passage hMSCs by
differential gene expression profiles.
Proliferation arrest influences hMSCs’ karyotype,
and at least 30% of senescent hMSCs display trisomy of
chromosome 8.23 hMSCs start to be polyploid (mainly
tetraploid) at passage 20, and become aneuploid afterward.32 During senescence, deregulated genes in hMSCs
were mainly found on the chromosome region 4q22-q23,
which when inserted into immortal cells caused a loss of
proliferation.12 Senescence is also associated with up-regulation of micro RNAs, namely hsa-mir-371, hsa-mir369-5P, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-499, and hsa-let-7f, which
change the methylation pattern.12 With respect to therapy
application, special attention should be given during culture to hMSC epigenetic changes and the appearance of
senescence that could result in genomic abnormalities.
Spontanenous Transformation of hMSCs
Cell transformation (spontaneous or artificial) is the process, initiated by at least 2 genetic events (mutations), by
which cells gain immortality. First studies of spontaneous
transformation claimed that unlike hMSCs, only murine
MSCs can spontaneously transform in culture.42 It was
concluded that in vitro BM-hMSC expansion and their
use in therapy are completely safe.11 But in parallel, Rubio
demonstrated23 that after 4 to 5 months of in vitro culture, 50% of the postsenescent AT hMSC clones can
escape the proliferation crisis, resume proliferation, lose
contact inhibition, and become tumor-like transformed
mesenchymal stem cells.23 It was argued nonetheless that
the susceptibility to malignant transformation is dependent
on hMSC origin, and that AT hMSCs derived from stem
cell poor fat tissue are more prone to transformation than
BM hMSCs derived from stem cell rich BM.11 This argument was banned when BM hMSC clones were shown to
spontaneously transform as well.21 A 2-stage model of
spontaneous transformation was proposed, according to
which a senescence crisis with proliferation arrest always
precedes the resumption of proliferation that occurs when
hMSCs undergo spontaneous transformation.44 This
model was widely accepted and challenged only by Wang
et al, who argued that spontaneous transformation may already occur as early as at hMSC isolation.24
Spontaneously transformed hMSCs (transformed
mesenchymal stem cells) are morphologically distinct
from early passage hMSCs and senescent hMSCs,23 as we

Cancer

demonstrated for BM hMSCs (Fig. 3). Being actively
proliferating and compact, transformed mesenchymal
stem cells exhibit a higher nucleus to cytoplasm ratio,
prominent nucleoli, and more desmosomes.45 Transformed mesenchymal stem cells derived from BM hMSCs
may sometimes become intermixed with short spindle
cells, which lack contact-independent growth and form
foci with cells released into suspension.24 Transformed
mesenchymal stem cells down-regulate expression of typical early passage membrane markers CD34, CD90, and
CD105, and phenotypically become CD133þ, CD34,
CD45, CD105, and VEGF receptorþ.23,24 Because
of the antigen profile and obvious transformed mesenchymal stem cell’s morphology, the progress of spontaneous
transformation is easy to detect.
Spontaneous transformation is accompanied by distinct transcriptomic changes. Cells bypass the senescence
crisis and transform by up-regulation of c-myc expression,
repression of p16 levels, acquisition of telomerase activity,
Ink4a/Arf locus deletion, and Rb hyperphosphorilation.44
Transformed mesenchymal stem cells display increased
transcription and translation of Cdk1, Cdk2 Cdk4, Cdk6,
cyclins B1 and D2, RAD51a, DNA-PKcs, ERCC4, DNA
ligase IV, DNA polymerase,44,45 and VEGF.23,24 In contrast, they display down-regulation of cyclin D1, cadherin
6, Snai1, ACTA2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, collagens Ia2 and Va2, syndecan2, fibulin2, connective tissue
growth factor, and FGF-2.44,45 A low level of TGFb expression in transformed mesenchymal stem cells compared with
hMSCs indicates that TGFb signaling is not active in transformed mesenchymal stem cells because of overexpression
of Smad7, telomerase, and c-myc.45 Although transformed
mesenchymal stem cells posses a high level of telomerase activity compared with hMSCs, they soon become aneuploid,
with various intrachromosomal translocations.24 Karyotype
changes are consistent among different transformed mesenchymal stem cell isolates, and they include a translocation
between chromosome 3 and 11, intrachromosomal rearrangements of chromosome 5, and the occasional presence
of an isochromosome 8.23 Whether the genetic predisposition of an individual is responsible for these genomic
changes, or they result from in vitro culture conditions,
remains to be investigated.

injured sites, and persistently colocalize with the sites of
tumor development.46 Because of that, they could be
used as drug carriers for treatment of tumors that are difficult to reach and remove. In vivo BM hMSCs efficiently home to brain tumor and human glioma
xenografts (U87, U251, and LN229).47,48 Unfortunately, culture-expanded hMSCs exhibit much lower
tropism to bone marrow and damaged tissue,43 because
in culture they lose CXCR4, which is a key receptor
responsible for hematopoietic stem cell homing.43 However, in vitro 3-dimensional culturing of hMSCs as spheroids increases stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)
(CXCL12) signaling, which restores functional expression of its receptor CXCR4 and homing potential,43 that
is crucial for hMSCs’ therapeutic application.
Homing potential of hMSCs to desired cells/tissues
was proved in vitro by hMSC coculture with glioma cells
or glioma-conditioned medium (Fig. 4) that increased
hMSC invasiveness, similar to the addition of VEGF-A.49
The in vivo homing potential of hMSCs circulating in the
bloodstream to the sites of injury/inflammation can be
regulated by adhesion of hMSCs to endothelium,

2524

achieved by pretreatment of endothelial cells with proapoptotic agents.50 Other angiogenic and inflammatory
cytokines and growth factors, such as IL-8, neurotrophin3, TGFb, IL-1b, TNFa, platelet-derived growth factor,
EGF, and SDF-1 enhance hMSC migration as well.48,51
Many of those are secreted by tumor cells,48 so this way
tumors could attract hMSCs in vivo, where hMSC migration/invasion toward tumor cells is accompanied by their
secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes MMP-2, membrane type 1 MMP, and MMP-9, and their inhibitors
TIMP-1 and TIMP2.51 With controlled/maintained concentration gradients of cytokines that recruit hMSCs from
BM via peripheral blood to injured tissue, hMSC homing
could be optimized. In vivo myocardial injury was shown
to establish the SDF-1 gradient toward the heart, which
recruited hMSCs from BM.52 Moreover, in regenerating
skeletal tissues, the hMSC homing may be improved with
growth factor delivery, as combined hMSC and erythropoietin infusion gave better results in limb ischemia
treatment.53
The hMSC engraftment at the site of injury is not
always optimal, and there is room for improvement. In

vitro hMSC chondrogenic predifferentiation apparently
increases engraftment during in vivo cartilage repair,34
and genetic modification enhances hMSC engraftment as
well. In an animal model, transgenic hMSC-MCN-2
more efficiently engrafted and activated a pacemaker
function of the damaged dog heart.54 In addition, hMSC
engraftment is improved by sustained delivery of growth
factors to injected hMSCs,34 their coinjection,55 or
cotransplantation of hMSCs with healthy tissue parts.56
Tumor Formation and Putative Involvement
of hMSCs and Transformed Mesenchymal
Stem Cells
Cell-based therapies for anticancer treatment rely on
hMSCs’ ability to home actively to distant tissues and
their intrinsic ability to affect the cells at the target site.
hMSCs can inhibit growth of the tumor in vivo57 and

Cancer

decrease the proliferation/invasion of hepatoma cells
(H7402, HepG2)57 and of glioma cells (Fig. 4) in vitro.
hMSCs inhibit the malignant phenotype of the cancer
cells by lowering their oncogene expression (c-myc, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, survivin, and b-catenin) and
increasing latent time of tumor formation.57
Unfortunately, hMSCs are also considered candidates for cancer initiation, because of their self-renewal
ability, which is similar to cancer cells, and their ability to
spontaneously transform in vitro,23,24,45 with higher frequency than other cell types.58 Such spontaneous genetic
changes, if occurring in vivo, could lead to the establishment of a malignant (stem) cell population.59 Indeed, in
vivo cancer metastatic cells acquire an invasive phenotype
via a similar epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which
also occurs during the 2-step process of hMSC spontaneous transformation in vitro.45 The hypothesis was proposed by Matushansky et al60 that tumors may develop
from highly invasive transformed mesenchymal stem cells.
They showed that stem progenitors of malignant fibrous
histiocytoma (MFH) cells can be derived from transformed mesenchymal stem cells, and oppositely, that
hMSC-like cells can be derived from MFH cells and differentiate in the hMSC’s manner.60 However, hMSC and
cancer cells still differ significantly regarding the expression of proliferation genes,61 which argues against the hypothesis of hMSCs being direct predecessors of cancer
(stem) cells.
Furthermore, Rubio et al45 hypothesized that
during spontaneous transformation, hMSCs undergo a
dedifferentiation process, resulting in transformed mesenchymal stem cells, which overexpress podocalyxin antigen
and stage-specific embryonic antigen-4—a pluripotent
marker of embryonic stem cells. Those markers give transformed mesenchymal stem cells a more primitive, embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like characteristic compared with
hMSCs.45 Similar to ESCs, transformed mesenchymal
stem cells are able to integrate into developing blastocysts
and contribute to normal placental tissue during embryonic development, without tumor formation.45 Their
repair role was also demonstrated in age-related tumors,
where by fusion of transformed mesenchymal stem cells
with host cancer cells, the latter converted into nonmalignant cells.58 Nevertheless it remains that unlike hMSCs,
injected transformed mesenchymal stem cells form poorly
differentiated, solid tumors with epithelial phenotype in
nearly all organs of mice,23 where they grow aggressively
and display large areas of necrosis.23,45 In tumors, transformed mesenchymal stem cells contribute to the tumor

vasculature and AT, and recruit host BM-derived cells to
the site of tumor formation.24,58 The unpredictable transforming ability of hMSCs casts doubt on their use in in
vivo therapies.

hMSC Genetic Modification for Anticancer
Treatment
Because of hMSCs’ ability to home to distant tumors,
strategies of using them in anticancer therapy are being
developed. BM is still the preferred tissue source for
hMSC isolation, but the low frequency of hMSCs in BM
necessitates in vitro expansion before clinical use. At the
same time, senescence-associated growth arrest occurring
during in vitro culture limits the hMSC numbers that
could be generated. Together with the transformation
phenomenon, this questions in vitro expansion of
hMSCs, which is necessary to prepare hMSCs for anticancer treatment via genetic modification.
hMSC’s limited lifespan can be prolonged by viral
transduction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT).62 Lentivirally transduced hMSCs never senesce
or malignantly transform, and apart from ectopic hTERT
expression, show no endogenous telomerase activity.62
The tumor suppressors Rb, p21, and p53 are not downregulated in transduced hMSCs, suggesting that growth
of those cells is still normal and under the control of those
known gatekeepers.62 Lentiviral hTERT transduction
thus seems to be a safe way to generate immortal nonmalignant cells for further gene modification and therapy
applications. For invasive types of cancer, a novel therapeutic approach using a combination of hMSCs as intermediate carriers and conditionally replicating
adenoviruses has emerged.63 Due to hMSC intracellular
support to conditionally replicating adenovirus amplification, more efficient tumor cell elimination was observed
in distant tumors compared with direct viral injection.64
The main aim of tumor growth inhibition strategy is
to genetically modify the hMSCs directly to act as a drug
vehicle that exerts tumor cell’s (tumor stem cell) toxicity
and causes complete irreversible elimination of tumor.
Treatment of human colon cancer xenografts (HT29Inv2, CCS) in mice with hMSCs expressing a suicidal
tyrosine kinase gene (HSV1-Tk) resulted in tumor elimination and postfestum healthy stroma formation.65
Therefore, genetically modified hMSCs with active homing potential and a preserved helping role in tissue regeneration could potentially be used for treating infiltrative
tumors that cannot be cured with conventional drugs.

Delivery of hMSCs In Vivo and Monitoring of
Their Behavior
Delivery routes and cell numbers required should be optimized for in vivo use of hMSCs for regenerative or anticancer therapy. In this respect, peripheral and direct
injection of hMSCs into the injured organ are still preferred routes to be used in regeneration therapies.54 Bone
fractures in rats can thus be cured successfully with paraspinal injection of 106 transgenic hMSC-BMP9,66
whereas cell doses of about 7  105 cells are sufficient for
restoring a pacemaking activity in dogs.54 Excessively
small cell numbers, however, may prove insufficient and
fail to show the positive effect.67 hMSC numbers should
always be optimized precisely to reach a positive outcome,
and they depend heavily on the delivery route to be taken
during therapy.
Direct hMSC injection is useful at the sites of soft
tissue injury, where by proper cell differentiation and
function acquisition the organ function can be successfully restored. But when regenerating bone or cartilage,
extracellular matrix components and their tensile
strength need to be restored for organ full function. In an
attempt to solve that, initial studies focused on hMSC in
vitro differentiation before transplantation34 and hMSC
embedding into scaffold structures, which can enhance
chondrogenic or osteogenic hMSC differentiation.38 After a variety of biodegradable gel scaffolds were
tested,34,68 natural silk and wool-like microfibers combined with nanoparticles evolved as the latest development in nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering
therapy.69 Because those scaffolds require mild aqueous
conditions during their construction, they represent an
option for labile cytokine or recombinant protein (bone
morphogenetic protein type 1) incorporation.70 In addition to serving as a release medium for cytokines and
growth factors, they act as an immune barriers70 and
could therefore be efficiently used during allogeneic
hMSC transplantation.
For designing new anticancer gene/cell therapies,
however, the possibility of in vivo, noninvasive, wholebody tracking during tumor targeting or tissue regeneration with hMSCs needs to be addressed. Past assessments
of hMSC behavior in recipients have relied on visual
detection in host tissue after sacrifice, thus failing to monitor in vivo hMSC dispersion. Therefore cytocompatible,
optimized labeling systems for hMSC detection evolved,
which allow tracking of the injected cells’ behavior
(migration) in vivo.71-74 Recent ones are based on quantum
dots—small,
light-emitting

nanocrystals, typically in the size range of 2 to 10 nm,
metal nanoparticles, or nanonatural fibers.71-73 Their
ability to either bind to selected integrins on the membrane of hMSCs or reside in the cell organelles73,75 makes
them useful for prolonged in vivo cell tracking. In case of
metal nanoparticles like super paramagnetic iron oxide73
or ferocarbuten,75 magnetic resonance imaging tracking
can be used, whereas hMSCs modified to express firefly
luciferase can be monitored by bioluminescent imaging
during tissue engraftment.46
hMSC-Based Cell Therapy and Reality
Understanding the aging effect on hMSCs is crucial for
autologous therapy of degenerative diseases and cancer,
because elderly people are primary candidates for hMSCbased therapies. By using a wide range of donor ages,
measuring various hMSC parameters, a significant reduction of hMSCs’ fitness in adulthood relative to childhood
was confirmed.76 hMSCs undergo a decline in cell numbers, differentiation, and expansion capacity during
aging.76,77 Moreover, hMSC pools of disease-afflicted
people may be deficient, as MSCs from a mouse model of
systemic lupus erythematosus display defects in gap junctions and impaired differentiation,78 and the elderly may
simply have inadequate BM hMSC pools because of its
depletion caused by osteoporosis or metastatic bone disease.66 This is problematic for the use of autologous
hMSC in therapy. In these cases, allogeneic cell sources
should be considered. Obtaining sufficient numbers of
allogeneic hMSCs for all treatments needed by patients
represents a limit to modern hMSC-based therapies. In
this respect, one should look for alternative cell sources.
Examples may be articular cartilage-harboring stem cells79
and fetal bone cells that are positive for Stro-1 (an hMSC
marker). Because the latter are more differentiated than
stem cells, fetal bone cells in particular represent an interesting allogeneic cell source in tissue engineering
applications.80
But could allogeneic cell therapy be as safe as autologous cell therapy? General concern over immune
response and hMSC rejection diminished when experimentally transplanted hMSCs were detected in most of
animals’ organs, indicating a lack of hMSC immune recognition, clearance,81 and graft-versus-host disease.81
hMSCs indeed alter the cytokine secretion profile (tumor necrosis factor-a, interferon-c, IL-4, and IL-10) of
immune cells (dendritic cells, naive T helper [TH] type 1
cells, effector TH2 cells, and natural killer cells) and promote anti-inflammatory phenotype.81 On their own,

hMSCs produce prostaglandin E2, which is causative for
immune response modulation81 and B-cell proliferation.82 Also, a Stro-1–enriched population of hMSCs
showed a 10 larger inhibitory effect on lymphocytes
than nonenriched hMSCs.27 Altogether, this may be
why infused hMSCs are only weakly immunogenic in
humans, which speaks strongly in favor of a valid clinical
use of hMSCs from HLA-mismatched donors.83 Nevertheless, in future therapies allogeneic hMSCs could be either artificially encapsulated84 or modified by
engulfment of microcapsules slowly releasing immunomodulatory cytokines34 to more efficiently escape
patients’ immune systems.

Conclusions: Expectations Too High?
A great deal of hope has been put into hMSC research and
therapy development, but in reality the beneficiary effects
of hMSCs may not live up to our expectations. hMSC
transplantations may for instance not result in adequate
hMSC engraftment, as proven in animal models,10 or
hMSCs could migrate to other organs and act there in a
harmful manner. Moreover, even if recruited correctly to
the damaged organ/tumor, hMSCs could fail to repair the
organ function or cure the tumor. Examples are predifferentiated cardiomyocytes, which failed to repopulate murine heart85 and porcine hMSC infusion, which failed to
repair renal lesions.86 However, most ongoing clinical trials for the bone disease osteogenesis imperfecta,87-89 heart
stroke,90 neurodegenerative disorder caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,91 and graft-versus-host disease88 are
giving promising results. But so far, we are still not able to
fully predict hMSCs’ behavior, homing potential, and
their ability to spontaneously transform. Last is a problem
at developing hMSCs for tumor treatment when genetic
modification and prolonged culture are needed. By optimized/standardized culture conditions and the use of
high-quality hMSCs (from amniotic membrane or CB),
spontaneous transformation, unless genetically predisposed, should be avoided in vitro. However, this does not
guarantee that the injected cells will not transform on in
vivo administration. But we believe that with the structural and comparative genomic characterization of cells,
we should in the future be able to answer how vital cellular
functions, stem cell differentiation, homing, and spontaneous transformation are related and why proposed tissue
endogenous hMSCs transform in vivo into tumor-associated fibroblasts or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts that
play an important role in the growth of epithelial solid

tumors.16 In this way, cell-based therapies for targeting
tumor stem cells and treating currently incurable cancers
may meet success and advance as accepted regenerative
therapies where hMSCs are already being used.
