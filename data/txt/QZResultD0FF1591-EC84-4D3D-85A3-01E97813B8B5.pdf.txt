Summary

Author Manuscript

Targeting sirtuins for cancer treatment has been a topic of debate due to conflicting reports and
lack of potent and specific inhibitors. We have developed a thiomyristoyl lysine compound, TM,
as a potent SIRT2-specific inhibitor with broad anticancer effect in various human cancer cells
and mouse models of breast cancer. Mechanistically, SIRT2 inhibition promotes c-Myc
ubiquitination and degradation. The anticancer effect of TM correlates with its ability to decrease
c-Myc level. TM had limited effects on non-cancerous cells and tumor-free mice, suggesting that
cancer cells have an increased dependency on SIRT2 that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.
Our studies demonstrate that SIRT2-selective inhibitors are promising anticancer agents and may
represent a general strategy to target certain c-Myc-driven cancers.

Introduction
Oncogenes that drive tumorigenesis have attracted extensive interest as therapeutic targets
for treating cancers. MYC, and c-Myc in particular, is one such oncogene. MYC was
discovered in studies of fulminant chicken tumors caused by oncogenic retroviruses, which

co-opted cellular c-Myc to generate the oncogenic v-Myc (Meyer and Penn, 2008).
Subsequently, mouse plasmacytomas and human Burkitt lymphomas were found to be
caused by c-Myc activation due to chromosomal translocations that fused c-Myc to the
immunoglobin (Ig) gene loci (Meyer and Penn, 2008). Recent genomic sequencing efforts
identified c-Myc as one of the most highly amplified oncogenes in many different human
cancers, further highlighting the oncogenic role of c-Myc activation (Beroukhim et al.,
2010). The identification of effective therapeutic strategies targeting Myc has been
challenging. Recently it was demonstrated that bromodomain inhibitors that target BRD4
could suppress c-Myc transcription and lead to tumor inhibition in vivo (Delmore et al.,
2011). This finding underscores the therapeutic value of targeting Myc.

The sirtuin family of NAD-dependent protein lysine deacylases has been shown to play
important roles in many physiological processes, including the regulation of transcription,
metabolism, and DNA repair (Haigis and Sinclair, 2010; Imai et al., 2000; Imai and
Guarente, 2010). Many of these functions are achieved by their ability to deacylate various
substrate proteins, including histones, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes (Du et
al., 2011; Haigis and Sinclair, 2010; Imai et al., 2000; Imai and Guarente, 2010; Jiang et al.,
2013; Peng et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012). Because the functionally related but structurally
distinct zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) are established cancer targets (Lee et
al., 2012; Marks and Breslow, 2007), there is interest in exploring whether sirtuins can also
be important targets for cancers (Fang and Nicholl, 2011; Herranz and Serrano, 2010;
Stünkel and Campbell, 2011). However, there is evidence suggesting both tumor suppressor
and oncogenic roles of sirtuins (Fang and Nicholl, 2011; Herranz and Serrano, 2010; Stünkel
and Campbell, 2011). In the case of SIRT2, genetic studies indicated that aged Sirt2
knockout (KO) mice show increased tumor incidence as compared to wild-type (WT) (Kim
et al., 2011a) controls. In contrast, SIRT2 was also observed to have tumor promoting
activity in several studies (Chen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; McGlynn et al., 2014; Soung
et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2013). Moreover, several
SIRT2 inhibitors have also been reported to have anticancer effects (Cheon et al., 2015; He
et al., 2014; Heltweg et al., 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011b; Mahajan et al.,
2014; McCarthy et al., 2013; Neugebauer et al., 2008; Rotili et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2009).
However, the moderate potency and specificity of the existing sirtuin inhibitors are
insufficient to draw conclusions about the anticancer potential of sirtuin inhibition. Thus,
whether sirtuin inhibitors are useful anticancer agents is still an open question. Here we set
out to develop sirtuin inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity to explore the
potential of targeting sirtuins for treating human cancers, especially c-Myc driven cancers.

Results
Development of a highly selective and potent SIRT2 inhibitor
Most existing sirtuin inhibitors are either not very potent (e.g. with IC50 values in the high
micromolar range) or not very selective (i.e. they inhibit several different sirtuins). More
potent and more selective sirtuin inhibitors would greatly aid in evaluating the therapeutic
potential of targeting sirtuins. To develop potent inhibitors specific for a particular sirtuin,
we used mechanism-based thioacyl lysine compounds. Thioacyl lysine peptides can react

with NAD in the sirtuin active site, forming a relatively stable intermediate that inhibits
sirtuin (Figure 1A) (Fatkins et al., 2006; Hawse et al., 2008; Smith and Denu, 2007). Recent
studies suggested that different sirtuins may have different acyl group specificity (Du et al.,
2011; Feldman et al., 2013; et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2012), which can be utilized to design
inhibitors specific for different sirtuins (He et al., 2012; He et al., 2014). To target the
sirtuins that can recognize aliphatic acyl groups, we synthesized four thioacyl lysine
compounds, TA (thioacetyl) (Suzuki et al., 2009), TB (thiobutyryl), TH (thioheptanoyl), and
TM (thiomyristoyl) (Figure 1B), and then analyzed their ability to inhibit different sirtuins.

Author Manuscript

Remarkable differences in the potency and selectivity of these compounds were observed by
sirtuin activity assays in vitro (Figure 1C, Figure S1A). TA could inhibit SIRT1, SIRT2 and
SIRT3, but not very potently. TB was a better SIRT1/SIRT2 inhibitor than TA. The IC50 of
TB for SIRT1 (3.8 µM) and SIRT2 (0.43 µM) were about 3 fold and >10-fold, respectively,
better than those of TA (Figure 1C). Further increasing the size of the thioacyl group by
three methylene groups lead to TH, which had even lower IC50 values for SIRT1 (1.2 µM)
and SIRT2 (0.13 µM). Remarkably, TM, with a 14-carbon thioacyl group, could inhibit
SIRT2 with an IC50 value of 0.028 µM, but inhibited SIRT1 with an IC50 value of 98 µM
and did not inhibit SIRT3 even at 200 µM (Figure 1C). None of these compounds can
efficiently inhibit SIRT5, SIRT6, or SIRT7. Thus, TM is a SIRT2-speific inhibitor in vitro.
To facilitate later investigations of TM, we also synthesized the corresponding myristoyl
lysine compound (M, Figure 1B) as an inactive control for TM. M differs from TM by only
one atom (the S atom in TM is changed to an O atom in M). As expected, M did not show
sirtuin inhibition even at 200 µM (Figure 1C).

To further confirm that TM is a mechanism-based inhibitor of SIRT2, we performed
substrate competition analyses for TM-mediated SIRT2 inhibition. At saturating NAD
concentration, the apparent Km value for acetyl-H3K9 peptide (acH3K9) increased with
increasing TM concentrations, whereas the vmax remained relatively constant (Figure 1E).
The double-reciprocal plot of 1/v versus 1/[acH3K9] revealed a series of lines that intersect
at the 1/v axis (Figure S1C), suggesting that TM is competitive with acH3K9. This is
consistent with our recent finding that SIRT2 possesses a large hydrophobic pocket that can
accommodate the myristoyl group (Teng et al., 2015). At saturating acH3K9 concentration,
both the apparent Km value for NAD and vmax decreased with increasing TM concentrations
(Figure 1F), suggesting that TM is uncompetitive with NAD, which is consistent with the
fact that formation of the inhibitory covalent intermediate requires NAD. We then used
liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) to examine the formation of the stalled
covalent intermediate. Ions with m/z of 1123.33 (the protonated intermediate) and 1145.25
(the sodium adduct of the intermediate) were detected only when TM was incubated with
both SIRT2 and NAD (Figure 1D), but not without SIRT2 or NAD (Figure S1B). Overall,
these results indicate that TM acts as a mechanism-based inhibitor of SIRT2.
TM exhibited potent anticancer activity
Sirtuin inhibitors have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, most of the
inhibitors used are not very selective and thus, inhibiting which sirtuins can provide
beneficial effects remains unclear. Having a potent and very selective SIRT2 inhibitor

provided a unique opportunity to investigate whether inhibiting SIRT2 can be useful as an
anticancer strategy. We initially explored this in several breast cancer cell lines because of
the substantial tumor-promoting role of SIRT2 in breast cancer (McGlynn et al., 2014;
Soung et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014) and the previous studies showing that SIRT2 inhibitors
exert anti-proliferative effect against breast cancer cell lines (Di Fruscia et al., 2012;
Neugebauer et al., 2008; Rotili et al., 2012; Seifert et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2014). We
assayed the ability of TA, TB, TH, and TM to inhibit three human breast cancer cell lines,
MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231. The cytotoxicity of these compounds correlated
with their in vitro SIRT2 inhibitory effects (Figure 2A and Figure S2A). TA, which showed
modest SIRT1, SIRT2 and SIRT3 inhibition in vitro, did not inhibit cell viability at 50 µM.
TB had greater inhibitory effect on cell viability than TA, but only showed inhibition at 50
µM. TH and TM were more potent than TA and TB. Compared with TH, the SIRT2selective inhibitor TM showed greater inhibition of cell viability. The inactive inhibitor
mimic M did not affect cell viability at 50 µM. Similar result was also obtained in HeLa
cells (Figure S2B). Next we treated eight different human normal and breast cancer cell lines
with TM. As shown in Figure 2B, different malignant cells showed differential susceptibility
to TM. And the two non-cancerous cell lines, MCF-10A and HME1, were much less
sensitive to TM, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of TM is relatively selective toward cancer
cells. We further evaluated the anticancer activity of TM using soft agar colony formation
assay. TM significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth of various cancer cells
tested (Figure 2C and Figure S2C), while the control compound M did not (Figure 2C).

The correlation between the cytotoxic effects of TA, TB, TH, TM and M and their in vitro
SIRT2 inhibitory activities suggests that SIRT2 inhibition could have anticancer effects. To
further confirm this, we knocked down all seven sirtuins individually in MCF-7, MDAMB-468, and HeLa cells, which were relatively sensitive to TM (Figure S3A). SIRT2
knockdown (KD) produced the strongest cytotoxicity in all the three cell lines tested (Figure
3A & S3B), which further supported SIRT2 inhibition as a promising anticancer strategy.

Author Manuscript

We then further examined the effect of SIRT2 KD in the same set of human breast cancer
and non-tumorigenic mammary cell lines in which the cytotoxic effect of TM was tested.
SIRT2 KD significantly decreased cell viability in a time-dependent manner in MCF-7,
MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 cells, but did not show much cytotoxicity in BT-549,
SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-453 cells or the non-transformed MCF-10A and HME1 cells
(Figure 3B). In MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, SIRT2 KD resulted in less than 1% cell
viability after 10 days of lentiviral infection (Figure S3C). Moreover, colony formation in
soft agar by MCF-7 cells was dramatically diminished by SIRT2 KD (Figure 3D–3F). The
knockdown data are thus consistent with the small molecule data, indicating that SIRT2
inhibition can effectively suppress cancer cell proliferation and that the anticancer effect of
TM is likely through SIRT2 inhibition.
TM inhibits SIRT2 in cells
We next wanted to determine whether TM inhibits cancer cells by targeting SIRT2. We first
carried out a number of experiments to validate that SIRT2 is the target of TM in cells. We
conjugated biotin to TM and M to generate Biotin-TM and Biotin-M compounds (Figure

S4A). We then added these compounds to either total protein extract (Figure 4A) or live
cells (Figure 4B) to pull down sirtuins. Biotin-TM was able to pull down SIRT2 but not
SIRT1 from the HEK293T cell extract. In contrast, Biotin-M, the inactive control
compound, did not pull out SIRT2 (Figure 4A). When assayed using SIRT2 KD cells, the
amount of SIRT2 pulled down by Biotin-TM was also decreased (Figure 4B). These data
suggest that TM targets SIRT2 but not SIRT1 in cells.

Second, we confirmed that TM inhibits SIRT2 in cells by detecting the acetylation level of
known SIRT2 as well as SIRT1 targets. In MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, TA, TB, and
TH, inhibited SIRT1, based on the acetylation level of a known SIRT1 deacetylation target,
p53 (Figure 4D). In contrast, TM showed almost no inhibition of p53 deacetylation. By
detecting the acetylation of α-tubulin, a known SIRT2 target, we monitored SIRT2
inhibition. TA or M, which did not inhibit SIRT2 well, did not affect the acetylation of αtubulin. TB and TH, which have intermediate SIRT2 inhibition potency, slightly increased
the acetylation of α-tubulin. TM, the best SIRT2 inhibitor, led to the greatest increase in αtubulin acetylation (Figure 4C). The effect of TM on α-tubulin acetylation was dosedependent, whereas M did not affect acetyl-α-tubulin level at 50 µM (Figure 4E). Similarly,
TM, but not M, increased the level of α-tubulin acetylation in MDA-MB-231 cells based on
immunofluorescence imaging (Figure 4F). SIRT2 has been reported to be not only a
deacetylase, but also a defatty-acylase (He et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014), so we further
examined the effect of TM on the defatty-acylase activity of SIRT2 in cells. Metabolic
labeling of fatty-acylated proteins revealed that SIRT2 KD (Figure S4B) but not TM (Figure
S4C) was able to elevate the fatty-acylation levels of many proteins, suggesting that in cells
TM is a potent inhibitor of SIRT2 deacetylase but not defatty-acylase.

Finally, to confirm that the anticancer effect of TM is due to SIRT2 inhibition, we tested the
sensitivity of cells to TM under SIRT2 overexpression or knockdown conditions. If TM
inhibits cancer cells by targeting SIRT2, overexpression of SIRT2 would decrease the
sensitivity of cells to TM (the increased SIRT2 level would require more TM for inhibition),
while partial and transient knockdown of SIRT2 would increase the sensitivity. Indeed,
overexpression of SIRT2 (Figure 4H) significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of TM (Figure
4G), while transient and partial knockdown of SIRT2 (Figure S4E) sensitized cells to TM
(Figure S4D). These results support the conclusion that the anticancer effect of TM is
through SIRT2 inhibition instead of other off-target effects.
TM inhibits tumor growth in mouse models of breast cancer

Author Manuscript

To further demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition can be useful for treating cancers, we tested
TM in two mouse models of cancer. The first was a xenograft model in which the triplenegative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was injected subcutaneously into
immunocompromised mice. When tumor size reached ~200 mm3, the mice were divided
into two groups and treated by either direct intratumor (IT) (Figure S5) or intraperitoneal
(IP) (Figure 5) injection of the control vehicle solvent (DMSO) or TM (1.5 mg TM in 50 µL
DMSO; n = 5) daily. Tumors were collected after 30-days of treatment and analyzed. TM
treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared to the control (Figure S5A, S5B,
and 5A). Histopathological examination revealed central areas of necrosis in tumors from

both DMSO and TM treated mice, but the necrosis was more extensive and the overall
tumor size was smaller in the TM treated mice (Figures S5D and 5C). IT TM injection
showed a stronger effect in reducing tumor volume and increasing areas of necrosis as
compared to IP TM injection. Analysis of TM content in tissue samples from TM-treated
mice showed that IP-administered TM reached the tumors, even though the serum
concentration of TM was low and a significant amount of TM accumulated in abdominal fat
(Figure 5D). TM did not cause significant toxicity in mice (one mouse from each treatment
group died, likely due to infection caused by repeated IP injection but not due to TM
toxicity) and no significant weight loss was observed in TM-treated mice (Figure S5C and
5B). Immunohistochemistry staining of Ki-67 was performed to assess the effect of TM on
the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo. As shown Figure 5E (upper panel) and 5F, as well as
Figure S5F (upper panel) and S5G, a significant decrease in Ki-67+ cells was observed with
TM treatment relative to vehicle treatment. To determine whether TM inhibits SIRT2 in
vivo, we performed immunofluorescence staining of acetyl-α-tubulin in the xenograft
tumors. As shown in Figure 5E (lower panel) and 5G, and Figure S5F (lower panel) and
S5H, the acetyl-α-tubulin level was moderately but statistically significantly increased in
tumors from TM treated mice compared with those from vehicle-treated mice, suggesting
that TM indeed inhibits SIRT2 in vivo.

The second mouse model was the mammary tumor model driven by mammary glandspecific expression of polyoma middle T antigen under the control of mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter/enhancer (MMTV-PyMT model) (Guy et al., 1992). The MMTVPyMT mice received daily IP injections with either the control vehicle solvent (DMSO) or
TM (1.5 mg TM in 50 µL DMSO; n = 10). The Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curve
showed that TM treatment significantly prolonged the tumor-free survival of mice compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6A). While the average time to tumor onset in the control
group was 48 days, the mean latency for TM-treated mice was 54 days. Histopathological
examination revealed more extensive areas of necrosis in the neoplasms from TM-treated
mice as compared to the control group (Figure 6B). A significant decrease in proliferation of
tumor cells was observed with TM treatment relative to vehicle treatment as measured by
Ki-67 staining (Figure 6C, upper panel, and 6D). A modest but statistically significant
increase in the acetyl-α-tubulin level was observed in tumors from TM-treated mice
compared to those from vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6C, lower panel, and 6E), indicating
that SIRT2 was inhibited by TM in vivo. The data demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition with
TM delays tumor onset in the MMTV-PyMT model and reduces tumor growth in vivo.

COMPARE analysis with the NCI-60 cancer cell panel points to possible mechanism of
action for the SIRT2 inhibitor TM
To further investigate the anticancer effects of TM, we first examined whether the level of
SIRT2 in different cell lines could be used to predict which cell lines would be more
sensitive to SIRT2 inhibitors. We checked the SIRT2 protein level in all the eight human
normal and breast cancer cell lines above (Figure 2B & 3B) to see if the sensitivity to TM
correlated with SIRT2 level in these cell lines. Compared to MCF-10A and HME1 cells, the
cancer cell lines showed relatively high SIRT2 expression. However, we did not see an

obvious correlation between SIRT2 level and TM sensitivity (Figure S6A and S6B) among
the cancer cell lines, suggesting that other factors account for the SIRT2 inhibitor sensitivity.

Author Manuscript

To examine the anticancer activity of TM against other malignancies and the molecular
mechanisms underlying its activity, we submitted the TM compound to the Developmental
Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of
Health for screening against the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell lines (Shoemaker, 2006)
at a single dose of 10 µM. The screening result showed that TM inhibited 36/56 of the
NCI-60 cell lines by >50% at 10 µM (Figure 7A). In particular, all the leukemia cell lines
were very sensitive to TM and most of colon cancer cell lines were sensitive to TM. In
contrast, melanoma and ovarian cancer cells were less sensitive to TM. Consistent with our
earlier findings (Figure 2), MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were very sensitive to TM. One
discrepancy was noted for MDA-MB-231 cells, which were very sensitive to TM in the
NCI-60 screening, but not very sensitive to TM in our study (IC50 34 µM). This could be
due to differences in the MDA-MB-231 cells or the culture conditions used in NCI-60
screening and our laboratory. To confirm our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells, we
purchased a new batch of MDA-MB-231 cells and showed that the sensitivity to TM was
similar to that of the cells we tested earlier (Figure S2D). Despite the discrepancy with
MDA-MB-231 cells, the screening results suggest that SIRT2 inhibitors can potentially be
used to treat many types of cancers.

Author Manuscript

To investigate how SIRT2 inhibition halts cancer cell proliferation, we took advantage of
NCI molecular target COMPARE analysis (Zaharevitz et al., 2002). NCI has accumulated
many data sets regarding the properties of the NCI-60 cell lines, including gene expression,
DNA methylation, protein expression, and post-translational modifications. The molecular
target COMPARE analysis serves to correlate the response of the NCI-60 panel to a small
molecule (TM in this case) to known molecular patterns. From this analysis, we found that
the sensitivity of NCI-60 cell lines to TM correlated best with c-Myc phosphorylation/
protein levels. In other words, cell lines with higher c-Myc phosphorylation/protein levels
were more sensitive to TM (Table S1). The correlation between TM sensitivity and c-Myc is
intriguing as c-Myc is an oncoprotein that is up-regulated in many cancers.
TM decreases c-Myc oncoprotein level in cancer cells

Author Manuscript

The correlation between TM efficacy and c-Myc was informative, but the small correlation
value (~0.5) was not sufficient to establish a mechanistic relationship. To further understand
the connection, we measured c-Myc level in the cells treated with and without TM or M.
TM decreased c-Myc protein level in a time-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells, whereas M
treatment had no effect on the c-Myc protein level (Figure 7B). Similar effects of TM on cMyc were also observed in K562 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure S6C and S6D).
Consistent with the effect of TM, c-Myc abundance was also reduced by SIRT2 KD (Figure
7D), suggesting that TM works through SIRT2 inhibition to decrease c-Myc. To further
establish that the reduction in c-Myc protein is important for the anticancer effect of TM, we
examined whether the sensitivity of cancer cell lines to TM correlated with the decrease in
c-Myc level induced by TM treatment. Among the six breast cancer cell lines in the NCI-60
panel, BT-549 did not respond to treatment with 10 µM TM. At 10 µM TM, the viability of

BT-549 was close to 100%. This result was in line with our own findings (Figure 2B).
Although higher concentrations of TM did decrease the viability of BT-549, the sensitivity
was much lower than that of MCF-7 cells. Consistent with the reduced sensitivity to TM,
SIRT2 KD in BT-549 cells did not decrease cell viability (Figure 3B and S3C). We
therefore examined whether TM could affect c-Myc protein level in BT-549 cells.
Consistent with the decreased TM sensitivity, TM treatment did not have a significant effect
on c-Myc protein abundance in BT-549 cells (Figure 7C). SIRT2 KD also failed to decrease
c-Myc level in BT-549 cells (Figure 7D). These data collectively suggest that the sensitivity
of cancer cell lines to TM correlates with the ability of TM to decrease c-Myc level via
SIRT2 inhibition in these cell lines. We further measured the IC50 values of TM in six
different cancer cell lines and the corresponding decrease in c-Myc level in these cell lines
upon TM treatment. Plotting the IC50 values against the decreases in c-Myc levels indicates
that there was an excellent correlation between them (Figure 7E), supporting that the ability
of TM to decrease c-Myc is important for its anticancer effect in the cell lines that are very
sensitive to TM.
MCF-7 cells were then further analyzed for Myc-specific biological effects. Flow cytometry
of TM-treated cells revealed a pronounced increase in cells arrested in G0/G1 phase, with a
concomitant decrease of cells in S phase (Figure 8A). Treatment of TM resulted in
significant cellular senescence by β-galactosidase staining (Figure 8B). Similar effects of
TM on cell cycle progression and cellular senescence were also observed in K562 cells
(Figure S6E and S6F), suggesting that the effect of TM-induced c-Myc decrease is not
restricted to breast cancer cells. Overall, the phenotypes of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and
cellular senescence are consistent with the anticipated effects of inhibiting cellular c-Myc
function (Wu et al., 2007).

Author Manuscript

To further establish that decreasing c-Myc is important for the anticancer effect of TM, we
examined whether forced overexpression of c-Myc in MCF-7 cells is able to reduce TMmediated cytotoxicity. Cells were transfected with c-Myc for 12 hr before being treated with
TM. As shown in Figure 8C and S6G, overexpression of c-Myc significantly reduced the
cytotoxicity effect of TM. Together, these results demonstrate TM decreases c-Myc, which
is important for the cytotoxicity of TM in tumor cell, although it is likely not the only
mechanism that underlies the cytotoxicity.

Author Manuscript

The c-Myc mRNA level was not affected by TM treatment, suggesting that TM does not
affect c-Myc transcription (Figure 8D, Figure S6H). Therefore, the effect of TM on c-Myc
protein turnover was tested. The half-life of c-Myc was shortened by TM treatment,
suggesting that TM promoted c-Myc degradation (Figure 8F). Treatment with a proteasome
inhibitor, MG132, prevented the TM-induced down-regulation of c-Myc, suggesting that
TM promoted the proteasomal degradation of c-Myc (Figure 8E). Increased proteasomal
degradation was associated with increased c-Myc ubiquitination (Figure 8G). It was
previously reported that SIRT2 can suppress the expression of NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase for c-Myc (Liu et al., 2013), which could explain why SIRT2 inhibition promotes cMyc degradation. Indeed, NEDD4 was up-regulated by TM at the transcriptional level
(Figure 8H and Figure S6H) and also modestly at the protein level (Figure 8I and Figure
S6C) in both MCF-7 and K562 cells. However, this is not a universal mechanism as

alteration of NEDD4 level was not detected in TM-treated MDA-MB-468 cells despite the
observed reduction in c-Myc protein abundance (Figure S6D & H). As TM regulates the
protein stability of c-Myc in all three cell lines, we checked the effect of TM on the
transcription levels of several additional known E3 ligases that destabilize c-Myc (Choi et
al., 2010; Kim et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2013; Paul et al., 2013; Welcker et al., 2004). As
shown in Figure S6H, NEDD4 and TRPC4AP were increased in MCF-7 and K562 cells, but
not in MDA-MB-468 cells; FBXW7 and STUB1 were up-regulated only in MDA-MB-468
cells; FBXO32 was increased in all the three cell lines. However, none of the E3 ligase
genes was obviously up-regulated by TM in BT-549 cells in which neither cell viability nor
c-Myc level was affected by TM. These results suggested that SIRT2 inhibition led to upregulation of several c-Myc E3 enzymes, which may result in the destabilization of c-Myc
by TM.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Previous reports have suggested that SIRT1 or SIRT2 inhibitors can have anticancer
activity. However, the potency of most of these inhibitors is modest, with IC50 values in the
micromolar range at inhibiting purified sirtuins. Most of the sirtuin inhibitors tested for
anticancer activity are also not very selective and can inhibit several sirtuins. The modest
potency and selectivity make it hard to rule out off-target effects and pinpoint which sirtuin
should be targeted for treating cancers. Our SIRT2 inhibitor TM described here has an
excellent combination of potency and selectivity that allowed us to conclude that inhibiting
SIRT2 produces anticancer effects in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Knocking down
of all seven sirtuins also confirmed that SIRT2 is important for the viability of various
cancer cell lines while knocking down other sirtuins either had no significant effect or much
less effect on cancer cell viability.

C-Myc is an important oncoprotein and is up-regulated in many human tumors. Thus, it has
been considered as a promising cancer target. So far, no small molecules can directly target
c-Myc in vivo. Recent studies showed that bromodomain inhibitors targeting BRD4 can
suppress c-Myc transcription and inhibit tumorigenesis (Delmore et al., 2011). Our studies
demonstrate that inhibiting SIRT2 offers a different way to target c-Myc. We show here that
our SIRT2 inhibitor TM can effectively decrease the level of c-Myc in various cancer cell
lines. Our data suggest that the ability of TM to decrease c-Myc abundance in different cell
lines correlates with the sensitivity of the cell lines to TM. We further demonstrate here that
decreasing c-Myc protein level is an important mechanism that accounts for hypersensitivity
of certain cancer cell lines to TM. However, it should be pointed out that effects on other
SIRT2-regulated pathways may also contribute to the activity of TM in cancer cells. This is
especially true given that even cells without TM-induced c-Myc decrease (e.g. MDAMB-231 and BT-549 cells) can still be inhibited by TM at higher concentrations. This also
likely explains why c-Myc overexpression confers some but not complete resistance to TM
(Figure 8C). We found that TM promotes the proteolytic degradation of c-Myc without
affecting its transcription, which serves as an important but perhaps not the only mechanism
by which TM destabilizes c-Myc. Aberrant translational control of the Myc oncoprotein has
been implicated in many cancers (Chappell et al., 2000; Wolfe et al., 2014) and might also
be involved in TM-induced reduction in c-Myc level. Our work establishes SIRT2 inhibition

as a strategy to target the oncoprotein c-Myc, which is effective in many human cancer cell
lines. Future detailed mechanistic investigations of the SIRT2/c-Myc regulatory pathway
could potentially lead to the identification of additional therapeutic targets.
The roles of sirtuins in cancer have been a topic of debate. Both tumor-promoting and
tumor-suppressing roles of SIRT1 have been reported. For SIRT2, Kim et al. reported that
SIRT2 is a tumor suppressor because Sirt2 KO mice develop tumors earlier than WT mice
(Kim et al., 2011a). Serrano and co-workers did not find a cancer-prone phenotype in
unchallenged Sirt2 KO mice that they generated, although they did observe that Sirt2 KO
mice had increased tumorigenesis when challenged with carcinogens (Serrano et al., 2013).
Contradictory to these genetic studies that pointed to a weak tumor suppressor role of
SIRT2, we found that inhibiting SIRT2 with TM has broad anticancer activity in many
cancer cell lines.

Different outcomes for mouse genetic studies and pharmacological studies in cancer cells
are not without precedent. Similar cases have been well documented in the literature (Weiss
et al., 2007). There are several possible explanations. First, there are several examples of
factors that have tumor suppressor activity in normal cells but nevertheless are required for
the growth and survival of transformed cells. For example, loss of function for the DNA
damage checkpoint kinase ATR causes modest tumor predisposition, but greatly impairs the
growth of established tumors (Bartek et al., 2012). SIRT2 has been identified as a regulator
of mitotic chromosome segregation (Kim et al., 2011a), a function that could account for the
weak tumor predisposition phenotype in Sirt2-deficient mice given the oncogenic
consequences of genomic instability. Nevertheless, a greater dependency of transformed
cells on SIRT2 due to increased mitotic and other stresses, or because of the regulation of
other targets such as c-Myc by SIRT2, result in heightened sensitivity to SIRT2 inhibition in
cancer cells. It also should be noted that small molecules may have off target effects, which
could contribute to observed pharmacological effects. While it is difficult to completely rule
out this possibility for the anticancer effect of TM, our studies using the inactive control
compound (M) and the SIRT2 KD studies suggest that the anticancer effect is largely
through SIRT2 inhibition.

An alternative explanation relates to the fact that in a genetic knockout, the protein is gone
and thus all the enzymatic activities and protein-protein interactions involving the enzyme
also are gone. In contrast, when using a small molecule to inhibit the enzyme, the protein is
intact and so are the protein-protein interactions that involve the protein. In the case of
SIRT2, another layer of complexity is that SIRT2 has multiple enzymatic functions. We and
others recently found that sirtuins are not only deacetylases. Some sirtuins, such as SIRT5
(Du et al., 2011) and SIRT6 (Jiang et al., 2013), prefer to hydrolyze other acyl lysine
modifications. Perhaps more surprising is the fact that even the well-studied deacetylases
(SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3) can remove long chain fatty acyl groups efficiently (He et al.,
2014; Liu et al., 2014). Although the exact substrate proteins for the defatty-acylase activity
of SIRT2 remain to be identified, our preliminary studies showed that the fatty-acylation
levels of many proteins were elevated when SIRT2 was knocked down (Figure S4B), but not
when SIRT2 inhibitor TM was used (Figure S4C). Thus, the small molecule inhibitor may
selectively target one of the enzymatic functions of SIRT2, thus contributing to the fact that

small molecule inhibitors may produce beneficial pharmacological effects that are different
from genetic knockout.

The assays were carried out using an HPLC-based method with different acyl peptides. The
detailed method is described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 3000–4000 cells per well. After 24 hr, test
compounds were added to cells to final concentrations ranging from 1–50 µM. Cells were
then incubated for 72 hr and cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Blue viability
assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Relative cell viability in the
presence of test compounds was normalized to the vehicle-treated controls after background
subtraction. Graphpad Prism software was used to determine the IC50 values.

Knockdown of SIRT1–7 in various cell lines was achieved by lentiviral infection. Lentiviral
supernatants were generated as described previously. Cell viability was assessed after 3, 5 or
10 days of infection by using CellTiter-Blue.
Animal experiments
All animals used in this study were handled in accordance with federal and institutional
guidelines, under a protocol approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC). For more animal experimental details, please see the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± sd (standard deviation, shown as error bar) from
at least three independent experiments. Differences between two groups were examined
statistically as indicated (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).

Significance
Inhibiting oncoproteins frequently found in cancers is a common theme in targeted
cancer therapy. One such oncoprotein is c-Myc, which is up-regulated in ~50% human
tumors. Small molecules targeting c-Myc are highly sought as anticancer agents. Our
studies identified SIRT2 as a promising target to treat c-Myc-driven cancers. We have
developed a SIRT2 inhibitor with the best combination of potency and selectivity
reported and showed that it has broad anticancer activity with little effects on noncancerous cells. The small molecule inhibitor studies combined with knockdown and/or
overexpression of sirtuins provide extensive evidence establishing SIRT2 as a promising
anticancer target, especially for certain c-Myc-driven cancers.
