Abstract
Fra-1 is a member of the Fos transcription factor family that is highly expressed in multiple cancers, playing
important roles in transformation, proliferation, and metastasis. In this study, we observed an inverse correlation
between the expression of Fra-1 in human stage II breast cancer tissues and the corresponding level of clinical
chemoresistance. Extending these ﬁndings in vitro, we found that knockdown of Fra-1 in breast tumor cells was
sufﬁcient to confer resistance to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, whereas enhanced Fra-1 expression could
render these cells chemosensitive. The tumor cell side population, which is enriched for cancer stem cells, was
found to be associated with chemoresistance. Increased side population fractions were detected among tumor
cell lines subjected to Fra-1 knockdown. In contrast, enhanced expression of Fra-1 was correlated with a
decreased side population fraction, and signiﬁcantly, this ﬁnding was recapitulated in vivo, where tumors with
enhanced expression of Fra-1 were found to have blunted growth. Tumor cells subjected to Fra-1 knockdown grew
faster and were larger in size. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that Fra-1 may be an important prognostic
marker for breast cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 72(14); 3451–6. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Chemotherapy has become a routine therapeutic approach
for the treatment of cancer, with signiﬁcant impact on patient
survival. Nonetheless, many unsolved issues remain that lead
to dose-limiting toxicities of chemotherapy. Among these,
cancer relapse and emerging drug resistance remain key
factors in determining chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy.
The cancer stem cell hypothesis suggests that a small
population of cells within a tumor will tend to share some
common features with stem or progenitor cells, including
self-renewal and differentiation. These cancer stem cells (CSC)
are thought to be responsible not only for primary tumorigenesis, but also for resistance to chemotherapy and subsequent cancer recurrence. A variety of mechanisms have been
proposed to contribute to CSC chemoresistance, including
relative quiescence, expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)

transporters and/or multidrug resistance transporter 1
(MDR1), a more robust DNA repair capability, and the elevated
expression of antiapoptotic proteins (1). All of these natural
characteristics combine to make CSCs a particularly challenging target for chemotherapy (2, 3).
The Fos family transcription factor Fra-1 has weak transforming activity, due largely to its lack of potent transactivation
domains. Fra-1 typically heterodimerizes with Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, or JunD) to form the activator protein (AP-1)
transcription factor complex. Initially identiﬁed as an immediate early transcriptional response element following exposure
to serum (4), Fra-1 was later found to exhibit transforming
activity in rat ﬁbroblasts (5) and thyroid cells (6). Recent studies
suggest Fra-1 to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer
progression, with elevated Fra-1 expression detected in breast
(7), lung (8), brain (9), colon (10) and prostate cancers (11).
Functionally, Fra-1 expression promoted tumor cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and increased cell invasion (12).
Here, we examined Fra-1 for its role in breast cancer progression via its potential effect on CSCs. Unexpectedly, we found
that immunohistochemical staining of human stage II breast
cancer tissues supported a signiﬁcant correlation between the
expression of Fra-1 and patients' responses to chemotherapy
and outcomes. When we directly tested the function of Fra-1 in
breast CSCs, we found that suppression of Fra-1 expression
correlated with both an increase in tumor CSCs and a concurrent increase in chemoresistance, whereas ectopic Fra-1 expression correlated with decreased incidence of CSCs and increased
chemosensitivity of murine breast cancer cells. Together, these
results suggest a novel role for Fra-1 in cancer biology, and raise
the possibility that Fra-1 may be a signiﬁcant prognostic
response marker for tumor therapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals, cell lines, and tissue samples
Female BALB/c mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age, were purchased
from The Scripps Research Institute Rodent Breeding Facility, La Jolla, CA. All animal experiments and protocols were
carried out according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and approved by The Scripps
Research Institute Animal Care Committee. Murine breast
cancer cell line 4TO7 was kindly provided by Suzanne
Ostrand-Rosenberg (University of Maryland, College Park,
MD). Human 293T cells were a gift from Wen-yuan Hu
(Biosettia). A total of 63 stage II breast cancer samples were
collected at the Cancer Institute and Hospital of Tianjin
Medical University after informed consents had been
obtained from all patients.
Lentiviral transduction systems
Murine Fra-1 cDNA was generated by PCR-based ampliﬁcation with the following primer set: forward primer: 50 GGCCTCTAGAGCCACCATGTACCGAGACTACGGGGAACCGGGACCG-30 , reverse primer: 50 -GGCC GGATCCTCACAAAGCCAGGAGTGTAGGAGAGCCCAG-30 , and cloned into XbaI
and BamHI restriction sites of pLV-EF1a-MCS-IRES-Bsd
expression vector (Biosettia). Three helper plasmids
pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-REV, and pCMV-VSV-G were kindly
provided by Wen-yuan Hu (Biosettia). Short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) of Fra-1 were inserted into pLV-H1-EF1a-puro vector
(Biosettia). Sequences of the hairpins and the scramble control
vector are the following:
shRNA1:
AAAAGTTCCACCTTGTGCCAAGCATTTGGATCCAAATGCTTGGCACAAGGTGGAAC
shRNA2:
AAAAGAAAGGAGCTGACAGACTTCTTGGATCCAAGAAGTCTGTCAGCTCCTTTC
Scr-shRNA:
AAAAGCTACACTATCGAGCAATTTTGGATCCAAAATTGCTCGATAGTGT AGC
Lentiviruses were generated from 293T cells according to
the protocol of Single Oligonucleotide RNAi Technology for
Gene Silencing (Biosettia). Stable 4TO7 cells were selected by
blasticidin (Invitrogen) or puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 48 hours
after lentiviral transduction.
HOECHST 33342 dye exclusion assay
Cells (1  106/mL) were stained with 10 mg/mL HOECHST
33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) with or without verapamil hydrochloride (50 mmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated at 37 C
for 1 hour as described previously (13).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells (1  106/mL) were ﬁxed with 70% cold ethanol for 1
hour, then incubated in ice-cold PBS containing 50 mg RNase
A (QIAGEN) at 37 C for 1 hour. Cells were treated with 10 mg
of propidium iodide (PI; 10 mg/mL, Molecular Probes),

incubated at 4 C overnight, and data collected on the next
day.
Protein expression analysis
Protein expression of Fra-1 was showed by immunoblotting
using antibodies (Abs) from Santa Cruz (anti-murine Fra-1,
anti-murine b-actin, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, and goat antimouse IgG-HRP). To detect expression of Sca-1, 106 cells were
harvested and incubated for 1 hour at 4 C in 100 mL of ice-cold
ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) buffer with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-Sca-1 Ab (BD Pharmingen). FITC conjugated anti-rat IgG (eBioscience) was used
as an isotype control. Intracellular expression of Ki-67 was
measured by FACS; 106 cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized
following manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience) and antimurine Fra-1 Ab (Santa Cruz), FITC-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG Ab (Southern Biotech) and FITC-conjugated antiKi-67 Ab (Abcam) were used for staining. For histology, parafﬁn-embedded human tissue samples were stained with Fra-1
Ab (Santa Cruz).
Doxorubicin extinction assay
Cells were seeded at 1.5  105/well in a 12-well plate 1 day
before doxorubicin treatment (Sigma-Aldrich). Doxorubicin
(1.5 mg/mL) was added to each well at different time points
(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, and 24 hours). The pumping abilities of
the cells were measured by FACS.
Analysis of apoptosis
4TO7 tumor cells (3  105) were seeded in a 6-well plate and
cultured for 24 hours before drug treatment. Cyclophosphamide (500 mmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into each well on
the following day and maintained for 24 hours before Annexin
V and PI double staining (BD Pharmingen).
Tumor cell challenge and cyclophosphamide treatment
BALB/c mice (n ¼ 4/group) were divided into 4 experimental groups. A total of 5  105 4TO7 cells with Fra-1 extinction,
Fra-1 overexpression, or control vectors were injected s.c. to
the left front ﬂank of mice on day 0. From day 3 to day 11,
cyclophosphamide was administered to all groups of mice by
i.v. injection (30 mg/kg) for a total of 5 times at 2 day intervals.
Tumor dimensions were measured in 2 dimensions with
microcalipers every other day and tumor volume was calculated as previously described (14)
Statistics
A statistical comparison of experimental groups and controls was determined by Student t test. Findings were regarding
as signiﬁcant if 2-tailed P value were less than 0.05.

Results and Discussion
We evaluated the expression of transcription factor Fra-1
within a panel of 63 parafﬁn-embedded tissue samples from
patients with stage II breast cancer who received chemotherapy following tumor resection by immunohistochemistry.
Results from immunohistochemical staining were scored as
negative (no Fra-1 expression), low (<75% Fra-1–positive cells,

Fra-1 Drives Breast Cancer Cells from Dormancy

Figure 1. Immunohistochemical staining of Fra-1 was carried out in
parafﬁn-embedded tissues from human patients with stage II breast
cancer. Fra-1 staining score was deﬁned as negative expression (A), no
detectable Fra-1; low expression (B), <75% Fra-1–positive cells and
weak staining; high expression (C), >75% Fra-1–positive cells and strong
staining. Scale bar, 200 mm. D, a summary of all immunohistochemical

weak staining), and high (>75% Fra-1–positive cells, strong
staining; Fig. 1A–C). We expected to ﬁnd a correlation between
increased Fra-1 expression and disease progression (7). Surprisingly, among the cohort of patients with rapid cancer
recurrence (<3 years), there was little staining of Fra-1, with
12 of 20 patients exhibiting no detectable expression, and 8
revealing weak expression. In contrast, each of the tissues
derived from patients who failed to recur for 5 or more years,
expressed Fra-1, with 9 of 22 patients showing strong expression. Patients whose disease recurred between 3 and 5 years
exhibited an intermediate phenotype: 1 of 21 tissues had no
detectable Fra-1, whereas the remaining 20 exhibited weak Fra1 expression (Fig. 1D). This trend was highly signiﬁcant (P <
0.001), suggesting that high Fra-1 expression may indicate a
delayed tumor relapse after chemotherapy. Conversely, the
complete absence of Fra-1 would seem prognostic for rapid
relapse. This correlation between chemosensitivity and Fra-1
expression was further conﬁrmed in a panel of human breast
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).

www.aacrjournals.org

To examine the impact of Fra-1 on breast cancer growth and
cell-cycle regulation, we generated stable murine breast tumor
sister cell lines with either enhanced or suppressed expression
of Fra-1. Fra-1 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in 4TO7Fra-1 cells, whereas Fra-1 expression was decreased by 2
independent shRNAs, which created the 4TO7-sh1 and
4TO7-sh2 cell lines. An examination of growth and proliferation of these cells via Ki-67 staining (15), indicated that 4TO7sh1 and particularly 4TO7-sh2 cells revealed a signiﬁcantly
decreased expression of Ki-67 relative to scrambled controls
(Supplementary Fig. S2A; #, P ¼ 0.12;  , P < 0.05). However, Ki-67
expression was increased in 4TO7-Fra-1 cells, which exhibited
enhanced Fra-1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2B;  , P <
0.05). During further evaluation, we assessed cell-cycle progression as a function of Fra-1 expression by FACS analysis.
Staining of nuclear DNA with PI showed that suppression of
Fra-1 resulted in an increased fraction of cells in the G0–G1
population, with a concurrent decrease in incidence of cells in
S- and G2–M phases (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Conversely,
ectopic expression of Fra-1 correlated with a decrease in the
G0–G1 population and increase in S- and G2–M fractions
relative to controls (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Together, these
data support prior conclusions by others (6) that Fra-1 plays a
positive role in regulating breast cancer proliferation in vitro,
yet was paradoxically associated with better clinical prognosis
in our study.
This paradox might, however, be resolved when one
considers both the relative susceptibility of highly proliferative populations to chemotherapeutic therapies currently
in clinical use. For example, slowly proliferating tumor cell
populations may represent a somewhat enhanced signiﬁcant
risk for more rapid breast cancer relapse. Accordingly,
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a characteristic
associated with among other factors, an incidence of CSCs.
To explore this, we further conducted Hoechst 33342 exclusion technique to identify populations enriched in CSCs in
different 4TO7 cell lines via side population gating protocols
(16). Our ﬁndings showed a dramatic increase in the CSCenriched population following suppression of Fra-1 expression, which was dose-dependent according to relative Fra-1
depletion (Fig. 2A and B), whereas increased expression of
Fra-1 depleted these CSCs (Fig. 2C and D). To conﬁrm that
gating of our side population indeed identiﬁed a CSC population, we costained for expression of Sca-1, a CSCs marker
(17–19), and found it highly expressed in the gated cells (Fig.
3A). Accordingly, increased staining of Sca-1 was observed in
cells lacking Fra-1 expression, whereas decreased expression
of Sca-1 was found in cells with enhanced Fra-1 expression
(Fig. 3B). Together, these data revealed a strong negative
correlation between the expression of Fra-1 and the relative
proportion of CSCs, raising the interesting notion that Fra-1
may promote loss of CSC dormancy, and thereby enhance
chemosensitivity.
To verify this contension, we ﬁrst tested doxorubicin
uptake as a function of Fra-1 expression. To this end, cells
were treated with doxorubicin (1.5 mg/mL) at different time
points (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, and 24 hours) and the retention of
doxorubicin assessed by quantitation of ﬂuorescence.

indicate that Fra-1 expression may be associated with different sensitivities to chemotherapeutic agents.

Fra-1 Drives Breast Cancer Cells from Dormancy

Figure 4. Fra-1 expression
inﬂuences chemosensitivity of 4TO7
breast cancer cells, both in vitro
and in vivo. The intracellular
autoﬂuorescence of doxorubicin
(1.5 mg/mL) was measured by FACS
at time points (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20,
and 24 hours) in 4TO7 cells with Fra-1
suppression (A, left) or ectopic
expression (A, right). Apoptosis of
4TO7 cells with Fra-1 extinction (B,

was evaluated by Annexin V and PI
double staining. Cells were treated
with cyclophosphamide (500 mmol/L)
for 24 hours before FACS analysis.
Three independent results were
calculated and shown as bar graphs.

experimental approach: 5  10
4TO7 cells, with varying Fra-1 status,
were injected s.c. in the left front ﬂank
of female BALB/c mice (n ¼ 4/group)
on day 0. All mice were treated with
CTX (30 mg/kg) by i.v. injection (day
3–11). D, when 4TO7 tumor growth
became visible, tumor volume was
monitored and results were
graphically displayed. Scale bar,
100 mm. Error bars represent mean 
SD.  , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01, versus
control group.

To further extend this result, we evaluated a second commonly used breast cancer therapeutic drug, cyclophosphamide, in our breast tumor sister cell lines. As might be predicted from prior studies of doxorubicin, a remarkably
decreased number of cell deaths was observed in 4TO7 cells
with suppressed Fra-1 expression (Fig. 4B, left;  , P < 0.05),
whereas more dead cells were detected in 4TO7 cells overexpressing Fra-1 (Fig. 4B, right;  , P < 0.05). Together, these
ﬁndings show that the expression levels of Fra-1 do affect in
vitro chemosensitivitiy of 4TO7 breast cancer cells.
To determine whether the effect of Fra-1 on chemosensitivity in vitro also extended to tumors growing in vivo, we
injected syngeneic female BALB/c mice with 5  105 4TO7
cells and then evaluated their response to cyclophosphamide treatment. Starting on day 3, and every 2 days
thereafter, mice were treated i.v. with cyclophosphamide

(30 mg/kg) and tumor sizes tracked. Mice were sacriﬁced
on day 23 and tumors were resected and weighted (Fig. 4C).
Following termination of chemotherapy, the 4TO7-sh2
group of mice exhibited enhanced tumor growth relative
to control group (Fig. 4D, left;  , P < 0.05). In fact, among
4TO7 cells with enhanced Fra-1 expression, chemotherapy
had a signiﬁcant impact on early tumor development. While
these tumors did continue to grow, they propagated at a
markedly reduced rate (Fig. 4D, right;  , P < 0.01). These
results also correlated with signiﬁcant differences in ﬁnal
tumor burden (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B) of different Fra-1 expression mice (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Importantly, these in vivo data not only conﬁrmed our in vitro
observations of the impact of Fra-1 on chemosensitivity, but
also suggested that Fra-1 could become a valuable clinical
marker of chemosensitivity.

Together, our analysis of human clinical breast cancer
tissues and our preclinical investigations show an unexpected but important ﬁnding indicating that patients with
high Fra-1 expression are more likely to present with a
delay in tumor relapse following chemotherapy. This is
surprising because initial studies attributed an oncogenic
function of Fra-1 in multiple solid tumors including breast
tumor (7–11). We also reported that Fra-1 played a crucial
role in modiﬁcation and maintenance of the malignant
phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages, which promoted breast cancer cell survival and invasiveness (20).
Thus immune therapies were targeted to Fra-1 in mice
(21, 22). In contrast, our current ﬁndings reveal that patients
with breast cancer lacking Fra-1 are more likely to undergo a
rapid tumor relapse after chemotherapy, which may make
Fra-1 a valuable prognostic marker for sustained tumor
chemosensitivity.
