BACKGROUND: High-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is frequently upstaged after surgery and is associated with uniformly poor survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may offer a way to improve clinical outcomes. The authors compared the survival
rates of patients with UTUC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery with the rates among patients who did not.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with high-risk UTUC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
by surgery from 2004 to 2008 (study group) compared with a matched cohort who underwent initial surgery from 1993 to 2003
(control group). Fisher exact tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Kaplan-Meier methods were used. The log-rank test and Cox
proportional-hazards models were used to evaluate the association of the 2 outcomes with patient, treatment, and tumor characteristics in univariate and multivariate models. RESULTS: Of 112 patients, there were 31 in the study group and 81 in the control group.
Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had improved overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) with a
5-year DSS rate of 90.1% and a 5-year OS rate of 80.2% versus DSS and OS rates of 57.6% for those who underwent initial surgery
(P 5.0204 and P 5.0015, respectively). In multivariate analyses, the neoadjuvant group had a lower risk of mortality (OS: hazard ratio,
0.42 [P 5.035]; DSS: hazard ratio, 0.19 [P 5.006]). CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved the survival of patients with
UTUC compared with a matched historic cohort of patients who underwent initial surgery. Patients with high-risk UTUC should be
considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in view of the limited opportunity to administer effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy

INTRODUCTION
The current standard treatment for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is radical nephroureterectomy. Results from
single-institution,1,2 multi-institution,3 and population-based4-6 studies have consistently demonstrated poor survival for
patients with muscle-invasive and nonorgan-confined UTUC and for patients who have lymph node involvement identified after extirpative treatment. Initial support for the use of perioperative chemotherapy for UTUC was provided by studies of bladder cancer indicating improved survival in patients who received neoadjuvant, cisplatin-based chemotherapy.7,8
The strongest argument for the use of neoadjuvant, as opposed to adjuvant, chemotherapy in patients with UTUC is based
on the high incidence of baseline and subsequent decline in renal function after nephroureterectomy. The use of adjuvant
chemotherapy in this population is limited by the significant loss of renal function that occurs after surgery. Studies have
demonstrated that >50% of patients who present with UTUC have chronic kidney disease, which worsens after nephroureterectomy and precludes postnephroureterectomy cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the majority of patients; indeed, only
19% to 22% of patients remain eligible for such therapy based on current renal function standards.9,10
We previously reported significant rates of disease downstaging and a 14% complete response rate after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy among patients with high-risk UTUC who underwent nephroureterectomy compared with the rates for a
matched historic control group of UTUC patients who underwent surgery without receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.11 An earlier study by Igawa et al of 15 patients who had locally advanced UTUC produced a 13% complete remission
rate and suggested improved survival.12 The objective of the current study was to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy confers a demonstrable survival benefit compared with initial surgery in patients with high-risk disease.

Neoadjuvant Chemo Improves UTUC Survival/Porten et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
On the basis of our finding that patient survival had not
improved over several decades1 and in light of the limitations of postoperative chemotherapy, in 2004, we began
uniformly offering neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients
with UTUC who presented with high-risk features at our
institution. The criteria used to identify high-risk UTUC
patients to be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
were a biopsy specimen that exhibited high-grade tumor,13-15 sessile tumor architecture,16,17 and large tumor
burden (measurable on axial imaging).18,19 This became
our standard practice based on the few retrospective studies available and expert opinion based on experience with
urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder. Patients who
elect to undergo initial surgery despite the recommendation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are not explicitly
accounted for in the current analysis, but they form a very
small proportion of the patients who are offered the neoadjuvant approach.
Thus, the study group comprised patients with
UTUC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical nephroureterectomy at our institution
from 2004 to 2008. These patients are the same as those
in our initial report,11 with the exception that only
patients with clinically negative lymph node (cN0) status
were included in the current analysis.
The control group consisted of patients with UTUC
who underwent a nephroureterectomy at our institution
from 1993 to2003, a period during which nephroureterectomy was offered to >90% of UTUC patients at our
institution.1 For the current retrospective study, we rereviewed the initial biopsy findings and included only those
patients who had truly high-grade disease on the basis of
the 2004 update to the World Health Organization tumor
classification system,20 and we also ensured that all
patients had cN0 status.
For the current study, from the patients’ records, we
obtained and evaluated multiple clinical and pathologic
features, including patient data (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status), tumor data
(laterality, radiographic tumor size, prior history of bladder cancer, location of tumor, tumor architecture), treatment (type and courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
lymphadenectomy performed), pathology (pathologic
classification, pathologic lymph node classification, number of lymph nodes removed; and presence of extranodal
extension, lymphovascular invasion, carcinoma in situ,
and multifocality), and survival (disease-specific survival
[DSS] and overall survival [OS]). Pathologic complete
remission was defined as the absence of any identifiable

malignancy in all resected specimens. This retrospective
study was approved by our institutional review board with
waiver of informed consent.
The Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
were used to compare categorical and continuous patient
characteristics, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to estimate the probability of OS and DSS rates starting from surgery. Patients who were alive at the last followup or who were lost-to-follow-up or died for other reasons
were censored. The log-rank test and a Cox proportionalhazards model were used to evaluate the association of these
2 time-to-event outcomes with patient characteristics, treatments, and tumor characteristics.
Clinically relevant variables and variables that were
significant in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. Age, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and sessile architecture were significant on univariate analysis for
OS and/or DSS. The number of lymph nodes removed
was added to the model as a surrogate to control differences over time in surgical management and principles of
lymphadenectomy for upper tract disease. The mere performance of a lymphadenectomy as well as the total number of lymph nodes removed was not significantly
associated with DSS or OS on univariate analysis. In a retrospective study, Roscigno et al recently reported that at
least 8 lymph nodes were necessary to consider lymphadenectomy to be sufficient in patients with UTUC21; therefore, we used this cutoff value in our analysis as a
surrogate to account for differences in surgical technique.
Lymphadenectomy in the study group included the paracaval or para-aortic lymph nodes with or without interaortocaval lymph nodes in those who had tumors above the
mid-ureter; whereas patients who had distal ureteral
tumors underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy.
SAS software 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and
S Plus software 8.2 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto,
Calif) were used for statistical analyses. P values < .05
were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The study group consisted of 31 patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the control group consisted of 81 patients who underwent surgery without
receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Table 1 lists the
results of baseline, surgical, and tumor characteristics of
the 2 groups based on Fisher exact and Wilcoxon ranksum tests. Differences in laterality seemed spurious, and
the lower incidence of lymphadenectomy in the control
group reflects changing trends in treatment of the disease.
Twenty patients (24.7%) in the control group received

3 patients. Kidney-sparing therapy (primarily gemcitabinepaclitaxel-doxorubicin) was received by 7 patients. All
patients who were started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy
were able to complete a median number of 4 cycles (interquartile range, 4-5 cycles; range, 2-6 cycles) before surgical
extirpation. No patient was precluded from surgery because
of preoperative chemotherapy.
Significant differences in disease staging were
observed between the study population and the control
group for individual stages and various stage subgroupings. For example, there were significantly lower rates of
muscle-invasive disease (P 5 .0017) and organ-confined
disease (P 5 .0024) in the study population versus the
control group when evaluating only those who had pathologically lymph node-negative (pN0) disease (Table 2).
Downstaging remained significant when pN-positive
patients were included (P 5 .0001 and P 5 .0005, respectively). There was no difference in the rates of pN1/pN2
disease between the control group and the study groups
(18.5% and 6.5%, respectively; P 5 .2218). The 5-year
OS and DSS rates were 80.2% and 90.1%, respectively,
in the neoadjuvant group versus 57.6% and 57.6%,
respectively, in the initial surgery group (Figs. 1, 2).
Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the
effects of individual factors on outcomes. Variables that
were significant and clinically relevant in univariate analyses were included in multivariate models, as described
above (see Materials and Methods). Cox regression

had a significant influence on OS (Table 3). Age, the

were not significant in the model. Similar analyses for
DSS indicated the significant influence of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and tumor architecture (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with
improved OS and DSS compared with a matched historic cohort of patients who underwent initial surgery.
Our results validate the initial observations reported by
Igawa et al12 and confirm the validity of using pathologic
outcomes as a reasonable surrogate for outcomes in
patients with UTUC. Prior studies demonstrated that

the majority of patients with UTUC present with
chronic kidney disease, and an even greater proportion
cannot receive effective postoperative chemotherapy
when adverse pathologic features are present.9,10 This
finding may explain the conflicting and largely inconclusive reports from previous studies on the utility of adjuvant therapy for UTUC patients.22-27
Despite significant improvements in imaging and
technologic advances in ureteroscopy (both presumably
enabling earlier disease detection and treatment), not only
have survival rates not improved for patients with
UTUC,1 but they may be worsening.28 These developments indicate that the treatment paradigm for UTUC
may need to shift from reflexive initial surgery to more
accurate, thoughtful risk stratification with the consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients who are
classified as high risk.
Accurate clinical risk stratification becomes essential
to avoid overtreatment and to identify the patients who
are most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To aid with clinical risk stratification, it has been
demonstrated in 2 preoperative nomograms that using a
combination of various clinically available factors—such
as biopsy grade, tumor architecture, results of selective
cytology, and imaging findings like hydronephrosis—can
provide independent prognostic value.29,30 These tools
can help make the selection of the most appropriate treatment for a patient more systematic and more accurate
than has historically been possible.
The limitations of the current study included the
retrospective nature of the analysis. We performed
pathologic reanalysis of any equivocal biopsy results and
excluded those that indicated tumors that were not high
grade. The survival rates for our control population were
similar to the survival rates in other published studies of
1797

patients with UTUC, supporting the valid use of this
group as an historic, matched control group. In a study
of 1363 patients with UTUC who underwent radical
nephroureterectomy, Margulis et al reported that
patients with high-grade disease had a 5-year survival
rate of 57.2%, which is very similar to our findings.3
Likewise, in a study of 252 patients with UTUC who
were treated surgically, Hall et al reported DSS rates
from 72.6% to 40.5% for patients who had T2
through T4 disease.2 Those data support the validity of
our control population. In contrast to pathologic outcomes reported in bladder cancer neoadjuvant trials,
documented downstaging for each individual patient
with UTUC is not possible given the inaccuracy of initial clinical staging. It is believed that clinical stage has
a misclassification bias of approximately 45%, and current expert opinion as well as many retrospective studies
have demonstrated that tumor grade is a stronger predictor of high-risk disease with a strong association to
advanced pathologic stage, recurrence, and outcome.1,3
Therefore, it is difficult to control for true clinical stage
in this disease, which adds to the limitations of our
findings and conclusions. In addition, a small number
of patients did have a history of bladder cancer, and
although this was not significantly different between
groups, it may confound findings and outcomes related
to DSS. Thus, matched historic cohorts like the group
used in this study provide the best available data for
assessing patient outcomes.
Nevertheless, only a prospective and, ideally,
randomized study can definitively validate these findings.
The design of such trials is made complicated by variations in the chemotherapy regimens needed, as observed
in our study. Given the relatively advanced age of patients
with UTUC and the high rates of comorbidity (including
baseline renal dysfunction and cardiac disease), the current dogma of devising narrow inclusion criteria for the
sake of study population homogeneity would render the
recruitment of patients with this rare disease even more
difficult, and the subsequent results would be inapplicable
to a large proportion of patients. It is on this basis that a
call has been made to consider in future trials more practical designs that allow for the diverse comorbidities frequently observed in patients with UTUC. In the
meantime, the results of the current study provide a strong
foundation for urologists and medical oncologists who
seek to improve the outcomes of patients with UTUC to
consider applying accurate clinical risk stratification and
to offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy to patients with
high-risk features.
1798

Conclusions

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk
UTUC resulted in significantly higher survival rates than
surgery without neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a matched
historic group.
