ABSTRACT
This study evaluated the factors impacting overall survival (OS) and time to
progression (TTP) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). HCC patients were grouped
based on tumor vascularity and lipidiol deposition after TACE. Tumor vascularity
was classified based on contrast enhancement on arterial phase baseline CT scans.
Lipiodol deposition was evaluated using CT scans. The progression-free rate was
significantly higher in patients with good blood supply + good lipiodol deposition
compared to those with good blood supply + poor lipiodol deposition. In patients with
poor lipidiol deposition, risk of death was significantly positively correlated with stage,
and negatively correlated with number of TACE procedures and degree of lipidiol
deposition after the first TACE. Risk of disease progression in these patients was
positively correlated with tumor size, and negatively correlated with number of TACE
procedures and degree of lipidiol deposition after the first TACE. Our data showed that
tumor vascularity and lipiodol deposition can be used as early radiological markers
to identify patients who do not respond to TACE, and who can be considered earlier
for alternative combination treatment strategies. Our data also indicated that poor
lipiodol retention may predict a poor TTP and OS despite the blood supply status.

of HCC patients present at the intermediate (BCLC
stage B) or advanced (BCLC stage C) stage of disease.
Patients with BCLC stage B are currently treated with
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [9]. TACE,
which selectively obstructs the tumor vessels, is
conventionally performed by intra-arterial infusion of a
viscous emulsion of an ethiodized oil such as lipiodol,
along with a chemotherapeutic agent. This is followed by
an injection of gelatin sponge particles which embolize
the blood vessel [10]. Embolization ensures the retention
of lipiodol thereby enhancing drug delivery, reducing
drug washout from the tumor, and inducing ischemic
necrosis. Molecular targeted drugs such as sorafenib have
also been recently used to treat patients with unresectable/
metastatic disease who are unresponsive to conventional
therapy [11].
A number of studies have investigated the prognostic
value of lipiodol retention and tumor vascularity in HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
malignancy of the liver, and the third leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. Chronic infection with
the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are
the most important risk factors for HCC, and patients with
untreated, unresectable HCC have a median survival time
of < 6 months [2, 3]. Almost 75% of all HCC cases are seen
in Asia [4], and HCC is a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in China [5].
Current therapeutic options are based on the
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system
which integrates tumor characteristics and performance
status with liver function [6]. Surgical resection and
liver transplantation is the currently accepted treatment
of choice in patients who have early stage HCC with
decompensated cirrhosis [7, 8]. However, a majority

Although early studies did not support the hypothesis that
lipiodol deposition was a predictor of overall survival (OS)
[12], other studies showed that HCC tumors which did not
exhibit lipiodol retention had a lower treatment efficacy
and higher risk of liver damage [13–16]. Furthermore,
TACE was found to be as effective as hepatic resection
when lipiodol was compactly retained within the tumor
[17]. Additionally, patients with well-differentiated,
hypovascular HCC tumors responded poorly to TACE, had
a shorter OS, and were associated with early recurrence
compared to patients with well-differentiated hypervascular
tumors [18, 19, 20, 21]. However, in patients with
unresectable HCC treated with TACE, OS was higher
in hypervascular responders, and in hypervascular nonresponders and hypovascular responders compared to
hypovascular non-responders [3]. These data strongly
suggested that tumor vascularity is not the only determinant
of treatment outcome in TACE-treated HCC patients.
The prognostic significance of biomarkers such as
alpha-fetoprotein, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 and des-carboxyprothrombin after TACE remains unclear [22]. However,
angiogenesis is known to be key to the pathophysiology
of HCC, and increased serum vascular endothelial growth
factor-A (VEGF-A) and angiopoietin-2 levels after TACE
were shown to predict rapid HCC growth [23]. Similarly,
increased levels of serum VEGF levels 1-2 days after
TACE in HCC patients was shown to be associated with
distant metastasis and poor outcomes [24]. There is a
current imperative need to identify novel and reliable
targets and biomarkers which would allow the clinician
to predict the course of HCC post-treatment in order to
personalize therapeutic strategies.
Based on current EASL guidelines, TACE is
ruled ineffective only after a patient goes through two
or three cycles of TACE with progressing disease. Our
present study aims to identify early markers that can
predict responsiveness to TACE treatment after the
first TACE procedure. Identification of early markers
is important because patients who do not respond
to TACE can be considered earlier for alternative
combination treatment strategies instead of waiting
for two or three cycles of TACE. In this study, we
evaluated the prognostic value of tumor vascularity
and lipiodol deposition on OS and time to progression
(TTP) in HCC patients treated with TACE. We also
investigated the impact of other risk factors including
baseline tumor size, number of nodules, Child Pugh
score, blood supply, AFP, gender, age, BCLC stage,
and ECOG score on OS and TTP.

age of 57.35 years. There were 63 patients who were
BCLC stage B and 38 patients who were BCLC stage
C. The mean tumor size was 8.2 cm, the mean number
of nodules was 3.05, the mean Child Pugh score was
5.54, and the mean baseline AFP was 614.74. The
study patients had a mean ECOG Performance Status
of 0.45, and the mean number of times they had
received TACE was 2.74. The mean degree of lipiodol
deposition after the first TACE was 58.32 %. A total
of 59 subjects had tumors with a good blood supply +
good lipiodol deposition, and 42 subjects had tumors
with a good blood supply + poor lipiodol deposition.
The mean survival time was 31.44 months and the
mean time to disease progression was 11.8 months
(Table 1).

RESULTS

Univariate analyses showed that gender,
number of nodules, ECOG Performance Status, the
degree of lipiodol deposition after the first TACE,
and lipiodol deposi­tion ≥ 50% were significantly
associated with disease progression (p < 0.05). The
hazard of disease progression was increased 1) with
increasing number of nodules (HR=1.12, p < 0.001);

Univariate and multivariate analysis to
determine factors associated with OS in subjects
with good blood supply
Univariate analyses showed that tumor size,
AFP, number of TACE procedures, BCLC stage, and
the degree of lipiodol deposition after the 1st TACE
procedure were significantly associated with OS (p <
0.05). The hazard of death was increased 1) with every
cm increase in tumor size (HR=1.05, p = 0.017); 2)
with every unit increase in AFP levels (HR=1.0004, p =
0.041); and 3) in subjects with BCLC stage C compared
to BCLC stage B (HR=3.23, p < 0.001). The hazard of
death was decreased 1) with each increase in the number
of TACE procedures (HR=0.65, p < 0.001); and 2) with
each percent increase in the degree of lipiodol deposition
(HR=0.99, p = 0.024).
Factors that were significantly associated with OS
on univariate analysis were included in the multivariate
analysis. After adjusting for all other factors, data from
the multivariate analysis showed that the hazard of
death was decreased with each increase in the number
of TACE procedures (HR=0.62, p = 0.002); and was
increased in subjects with BCLC stage C compared to
BCLC stage B (HR=2.6, p = 0.001) (Table 2). There was
no significant difference in OS rates between subjects
with good blood supply + good lipiodol deposition and
those with good blood supply + poor lipiodol deposition
(p = 0.709) (Figure 1).

Patients were categorized into two groups based
on their lipiodol deposition (< 50% lipiodol deposi­
tion or > 50% lipiodol deposition). After adjusting for
all other factors, the lipiodol deposition group was
not associated with disease progression (p > 0.05)
(Multivariate 2, Table 2 ).
Patients with good blood supply + good lipiodol
deposition had a significantly higher progression-free
rate compared to patients with good blood supply + poor
lipiodol deposition (p = 0.027) (Figure 2).

Baseline characteristics of subjects with poor
lipiodol deposition
There were 62 males and 11 females in the group

a mean age of 57.01 years. There were 40 subjects who
were BCLC stage B, and 33 subjects who were BCLC
stage C. The mean tumor size was 8.41 cm, the mean
number of nodules was 3, the mean Child Pugh score

poor TACE outcome (Supplementary Figure S1). Case 2
was a 45-year-old BCLC stage B male patient with poor

pattern as predicted (Supplementary Figure S2). Case 3
was a 50-year-old BCLC stage C female HCC patient who
showed a very good lipiodol retention pattern immediately
after TACE, and had a significant decrease in lipiodol
retention later with a poor TACE outcome (Supplementary
Figure S3). The decrease in lipiodol retention could be
either because 1) although the lipiodol retention was
originally good, it was gradually degraded by the tumor
cells, or 2) it was originally a bad lipiodol retention.

Additionally, different situations may call for different
treatment modalities. For example, in the first situation,
TACE may be performed repeatedly and sorafenib may
be used during the interval between TACE sessions; and in
the 2nd situation (or in tumors with poor blood supplies),
TACE may be stopped relatively early, and sorafenib may
be used to delay tumor progression.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of
tumor vascularity and lipiodol deposition pattern on OS
and TTP in patients with advanced HCC treated with
TACE. We showed that tumor vascularization and lipiodol

supplies.
deposition can be used as radiological markers to predict/
reflect treatment efficacy after TACE. A radiological
finding of angiogenesis after TACE at the site of the
tumor is a novel marker for early identification of TACE
non-respondent patients, who can then be treated with
alternative combination treatment strategies.
A number of studies have investigated factors
that impact disease progression and survival after
TACE in patients with advanced HCC. Tumor number
> 5 was shown to be a significant negative predictor
of outcome after TACE [21]. Our data were consistent
with this study and showed that increased number of
nodules correlated with a significantly higher risk of
disease progression in the good blood supply group.
Although Child-Pugh grading was previously shown to
be an independent predictor of overall survival [25, 26],
we did not observe a correlation between Child Pugh
score and OS or disease progression in the two groups
of patients. Advanced disease stage (BCLC stage C)
has previously been shown to be a negative predictor
for TACE in randomized controlled trials [27], and
this agreed with our present results which showed a
higher risk of death in BCLC stage C patients compared
to BCLC stage B patients in both study groups. We
showed an inverse correlation between hazard of
death and number of TACE cycles in all patients.
Additionally, patients with poor lipiodol deposition
had a decreased hazard of disease progression with
increasing number of TACE procedures. Our data were
consistent with previous results showing a positive
correlation between number of TACE cycles and OS
and disease progression [28].

Angiogenesis is thought to influence tumor survival
after TACE likely via the VEGF signaling pathway
[29]. Studies investigating tumor vascularity as a factor
impacting treatment outcome after TACE showed that
high serum VEGF levels were significantly correlated
with poor outcomes after TACE [30]. However, other
studies showed that patients with hypovascular HCC had
a poorer response, poorer survival, and early recurrence
compared to patients with hypervascular tumors [3, 18,
20, 21], possibly because the chemotherapeutic agent or
embolic agent is more efficiently delivered to tumors with
a good arterial supply. These data suggested that the role
of tumor vascularity in treatment response and OS is not
completely understood. Lipiodol accumulation has also
been suggested as an important prognostic factor after
TACE, although the mechanism remains unclear. It was
recently shown that uptake of non-compact lipiodol was a
risk factor for local recurrence, and that uptake of compact
lipiodol resulted in complete necrosis of resected tissue
[31, 32]. In HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus
(PVTT), lipiodol accumulation in the PVTT after TACE
was a predictor of longer survival [26]. TACE-treated
HCC patients who had lipiodol accumulation surrounding
the HCC lesion were shown to have significantly higher
disease free survival (DFS) rates compared to patients with
lipiodol accumulation involving the lesion, or covering the
lesion [33].
Using a combination of tumor vascularity as well as
lipiodol deposition as a prognostic factor for TACE, we
showed that although there was no significant difference
in OS rates between subjects with good blood supply
+ good lipiodol deposition and those with good blood
7249

supply + poor lipiodol deposition, the progression-free
rates were significantly higher in patients with good blood
supply + good lipiodol deposition compared to those with
good blood supply + poor lipiodol deposition. There was
no significant difference in OS rates or progression-free
rates between subjects with good blood supply + poor
lipiodol deposition and those with poor blood supply +
poor lipiodol deposition. Interestingly, patients with good
tumor vascularity are generally considered to have good
lipiodol retention and therefore, a good prognosis. This
was demonstrated in our representative Case 3 patient who
showed angiogenesis at the original site of the tumor, and
a good lipiodol retention pattern immediately after TACE.
However, although this patient had a good TACE outcome
initially, there was a significant decrease in lipiodol
retention at a later stage leading to a poor TACE outcome
in this patient. These data suggested that a poor lipiodol
retention would result in a poor TACE outcome despite the
status of tumor vascularity.
Previous studies showed that TACE induced the
expression of angiogenic factors in residual tumor cells.
Part of the non-embolized liver exhibited compensatory
hyperplasia, and HCC recurrence was attributed to the
establishment of collateral circulation after TACE. It
was thought that this could play an important role in
reducing lipiodol deposition [34, 35]. These data support
our hypothesis that 1) tumor vascularity as well as
lipiodol deposition should be considered during clinical
management after TACE, and 2) a poor lipiodol retention
pattern would result in a poor TACE outcome, despite the
blood supply status. Possible reasons for poor lipiodol
deposition in tumor may be: 1) Clinicians sometimes fail
to find the supply arteries, or in situations of arteriovenous
fistula, there is poor blood supply or collateral circulation
formation leading to poor lipiodol retention, or 2) Tumor
cells “eat” up the deposited lipiodol possibly by remaining
in a differentiated state and retaining their ability to
consume foreign bodies (Supplementary Figure S3).
In conclusion, current EASL guidelines dictate that
TACE non-responsiveness should be determined only after
several cycles of TACE. Our present study used tumor
vascularity and lipiodol deposition as early radiological
markers of TACE non-responsiveness in patients with
advanced HCC. We showed that risk of death decreased
with increased number of TACE procedures, and increased
deposition of lipiodol, while it was increased in subjects
with BCLC stage C compared to BCLC stage B. The risk
of disease progression was increased with 1) increasing
number of nodules and 2) increasing ECOG score. Risk
of disease progression was decreased with increasing
number of TACE procedures, and with every percent
increase in the degree of lipiodol deposition after the first
TACE procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report which used both tumor vascularity and lipiodol
deposition to evaluate the risk of disease progression after
TACE in advanced HCC. We demonstrated that poor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lipiodol retention resulted in poor TACE outcomes, despite
good tumor vascularity. In addition, our results may also
explain why patients who respond well to TACE do not
benefit from addition of sorafenib to their TACE procedure
compared to patients who do not respond to TACE. The
major limitation of this study was its retrospective nature.
Other important limitations are 1) the small sample size, 2)
determination of lipiodol deposition is subjective, and 3)
although TACE impacts blood supply to the tumor, direct
assessment of the tumor is still a challenge.
Our data have important implications for the clinical
management of patients with advanced HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective, single-center study evaluated
records of successive subjects who were diagnosed with
HCC at the Department of Interventional Radiology of
Henan Tumor Hospital between April 2004 and March
2012. Inclusion criteria were 1) diagnosis of HCC (BCLC
stage B or C); 2) Child-Pugh grade A or B; 3) ECOG score
of 0 or 1; 4) received at least two cycles of TACE. Exclusion
criteria were 1) previous treatment with microwave
ablation, radiofrequency ablation, surgical resection or
liver transplantation after TACE; 2) platelet count < 50 ×
109 / L. Doxorubicin (Pude Pharmacy, Datong, China) was
used at a concentration of 10 – 30 mg/m2 and mixed with
5 – 20 mL of iodized oil (Lipiodol Ultrafluide, Laboratoire
Guerbet, Aul-nay-sous-Bois, France). Under fluoroscopic
monitoring, the mixture was infused at a rate of 1 – 2 mL/
min through a microcatheter until stasis flow in tumor
vascularity was achieved. A gelatin sponge (Jingling,
Nanjing, China) was used to embolize the feeding artery
of the tumor. All treatments in this study were based on the
standard of care in alignment with international standards.
Follow-up visits were done every 2-3 months. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Henan Tumor
Hospital, and written, informed consent was obtained from
all study subjects.
Since the inclusion criteria stated that all study
patients were required to undergo at least two cycles
of TACE, and TACE is the standard therapy for stage B
patients, our cohort had a larger number of BCLC stage B
patients than BCLC stage C patients. The gender ratio of
our study population was typical of the Chinese population.
Patients were classified into two groups based on tumor
vascularity and lipiodol deposition after the first TACE.
There were 101 patients in the good blood supply group
and 73 patients in the poor lipiodol deposition group.
Tumor vascularity was evaluated as previously described
[20, 21]. The degree of contrast enhancement on arterial
phase baseline CT scans was used to classify tumors as
hypervascular or hypovascular. In hypervascular tumor
lesions, the density of tumor lesions was significantly higher
than the density of the surrounding liver parenchyma on the
enhanced CT arterial phase scan. In hypovascular tumors,
7250

the tumor lesion density was equal to or lower than the
density of the surrounding liver parenchyma.
Lipiodol deposition was evaluated using CT scans.
Areas with lipiodol deposition had a significantly higher
density than areas of no lipiodol deposition, while the
surrounding liver parenchyma showed medium density.

Statistical analysis
For baseline distribution, continuous variables
were presented as means and standard deviations, and
categorical variables were presented as counts and
percentages.
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard
models were used to investigate the factors associated
with overall survival and disease progression. Factors
which were found to be significantly associated with
overall survival or disease progression in the univariate
model were included in the multivariate analysis. KaplanMeier curves were used to determine the survival rates
and progression-free rates in subjects in the different
experimental groups.
All statistical analyses were performed with the
IBM SPSS statistical software version 22 for Windows
(IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). A two-tailed p of
< 0.05 was considered significant.
