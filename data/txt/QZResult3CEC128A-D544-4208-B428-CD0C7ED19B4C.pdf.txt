Abstract
A-Raf belongs to the family of oncogenic Raf kinases that are involved in mitogenic signaling by activating
the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)–ERK pathway.
Low kinase activity of A-Raf toward MEK suggested that A-Raf might have alternative functions. Here, we
show that A-Raf prevents cancer cell apoptosis contingent on the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H) splice factor, which is required for the correct transcription and expression
of a-raf. Apoptosis was prevented by A-Raf through sequestration and inactivation of the proapoptotic MST2
kinase. Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of hnRNP H or A-Raf resulted in MST2-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, enforced expression of either hnRNP H or A-Raf partially counteracted apoptosis induced
by etoposide. In vivo expression studies of colon specimens corroborated the overexpression of hnRNP H in
malignant tissues and its correlation with A-Raf levels. Our findings define a novel mechanism that is usurped
in tumor cells to escape naturally imposed apoptotic signals. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1679–88. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H) is
a member of the subfamily of hnRNPs, including hnRNP H,
H′, F, and 2H9 (1). hnRNP H functions in the splicing of selected target mRNAs, such as c-src in neuronal cells (2), bcl-x
(3, 4), plp/dm20 (5), Drosophila nanos (6), HIV-1 splicing substrates (7), and rodent tropomyosin (8). According to available
knowledge of their functions, hnRNP F/H and hnRNP A/B
are key players in alternative splicing (9). As shown more recently, they also have a role in generic splicing (i.e., in molecAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Head and Neck Research, LudwigMaximilians-Universität München; 2Clinical Cooperation Group Molecular

ular mechanisms of intron definition; ref. 10). Overexpression
of hnRNP H was described in various human cancers, including hepatocellular, pancreatic, and laryngeal carcinomas
(11, 12). Whether and how hnRNP H is linked to the pathogenesis of cancer remains unexplored to date. We combined
specific inhibition of hnRNP H expression with whole-genome transcriptome analysis, with the aim to analyze the
phenotype of hnRNP H–deficient carcinoma cells. High levels
of hnRNP H were mandatory for the expression of the fulllength A-Raf protein, whereas it affected neither Raf-1 nor
B-Raf protein expression. On knockdown of hnRNP H expression, a-raf mRNA levels were reduced. The expression of ARaf was essential to sequester and deactivate the proapoptotic kinase MST2 and inhibit apoptosis. Thus, this study provides a rational explanation for the overexpression of hnRNP
H in human tumors as a splicing regulator of the a-raf
mRNA. In addition, it identifies a role for A-Raf as a potent
inhibitor of the MST2 tumor suppressor pathway in carcinoma cells.

Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemistry. Carcinoma specimen and healthy
tissue were obtained during routine biopsy or surgery after
informed consent. Carcinoma and healthy tissue specimens
were snap frozen, cryopreserved, and processed to generate
serial sections (4 μm). For immunohistologic staining, polyclonal rabbit anti-human hnRNP H antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) and polyclonal goat anti-human A-Raf antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Antigen-antibody
complexes were visualized using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
method (13).

Cell lines. HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells, GHD-1
human hypopharynx carcinoma cells, HCT116 human colon
carcinoma cells, and HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells
were cultured in standard DMEM containing 10% FCS and
passaged thrice each week. HeLa, HCT116, and HEK293 cell
lines were purchased from either the American Type Culture
Collection or Cancer Research UK. The cells were authenticated by the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures in
September 2009 using microsatellite genotyping (PCR based).
GHD-1 is a self-established cell line from a hypopharynx head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumor (14).
Laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Endogenous
A-Raf and MST2 expression in HeLa carcinoma cells and
human carcinoma specimen was analyzed using a fluorescence laser scanning system (TCS-SP2 scanning system and
DM IRB inverted microscope, Leica). For A-Raf, MST2, and
cytochrome c detection, cells were fixed and stained with
specific antibodies against A-Raf, MST2, and cytochrome
c. Dye-coupled Alexa Fluor antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488
and Alexa Fluor 647, Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. Subsequently, Hoechst 33342 was used
for labeling of nuclear DNA (Sigma). Confocal Software Lite
(Leica) for evaluation and quantification was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Transfections. Transient transfections of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and expression plasmids were conducted
with MATra-A reagent (IBA) or the Nucleofector system
(Amaxa GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amounts of transfected DNA or siRNA were
kept constant by filling up with empty vector or control
siRNA as required. The following siRNA sequences were
used: hnRNP H, 5′-GGAGCUGGCUUUGAGAGGAdTdT-3′
(siRNA#1), 5′-GAAUAGGGCACAGGUAUAUdTdT-3′ (siRNA#2), and 5′-GCAAGGAAGAAAUUGUUCAdTdT-3′ (siRNA#3; Eurogentec); A-Raf, Silencer Validated siRNA 151
(Ambion); MST2, 5′-GGAUAGUUUUUCAAAUAGGdTdT-3′;
and control siRNA, 5′-UCGUCCGUAUCAUUUCAAUdTdT-3′.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA
from cell lines was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Macherey-Nagel), and cDNA was generated using
the reverse transcription system (Promega) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from human tissues was isolated using the Precellys 24 Cell Lysis System
(Bertin Technologies) and the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
We performed semiquantitative PCR analysis for the expression of hnrnp h, Bcl-x, a-raf, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and mapk1 (95°C for
30 s, annealing for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s). Amplicon size
of the PCR is given in brackets: hnRNP H (385 bp),
5′-AAAATGGGGCTCAAGGTATTCG-3′ and 5′GCTATTTCCTGTGAAGCAAACTGC-3′; A-Raf (210 bp),
5′-ATGGAGCCACCACGGGGC-3′ and 5′-CGTCTTT‐
CGTCCCTTGATGAGTC-3′; Bcl-x (xl isoform, 456 bp; xs
isoform, 267 bp), 5′-ATGGCAGCAGTAAAGCAAGCG-3′ and

5′-TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA-3′; GAPDH (258 bp), 5′TGTCGCTCTTGAAGTCAGAGGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGAACATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTG-3′; and MAPK1 (233 bp),
5′-CCTTCCAACCTGCTGCTCAACAC-3′ and 5′-GGAAAGATGGGCCTGTTAGAAAGC-3′. ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD)7 was used for quantification of RT-PCRs.
Immunoprecipitations. Hemagglutinin (HA)–A-Raf was
immunoprecipitated using immobilized monoclonal mouse
anti-HA tag antibody 3F10 (Roche Diagnostics). Flag-MST2,
Flag–A-RafWT and mutants, Flag–Raf-1, and Flag–B-Raf were
immunoprecipitated using immobilized monoclonal mouse
anti-Flag antibody M2 (Sigma). Endogenous A-Raf was immunoprecipitated using the polyclonal goat anti-human A-Raf
antibody. Endogenous MST2 was immunoprecipitated using
the polyclonal goat anti-human MST2 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). As an isotype control, the polyclonal goat
anti-human enolase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
was used. HA-tagged A-Raf was immunoprecipitated using
the monoclonal mouse anti-HA tag antibody 3F10. All antibodies were covalently bound to protein G–Sepharose (Amersham) as described elsewhere (15) to avoid interference of
immunoglobulin heavy chain bands with the similar-sized
MST2 protein. Cells were lysed in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.5% NP40 supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics).
Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation (20,000 × g,
10 min) and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with lysis
buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted.
Immunoblot analysis. Protein lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS PAGE (10–15%) and blotted on
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Protein visualization was performed using the following antibodies in
combination with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare): polyclonal rabbit anti-human hnRNP H
antibody, polyclonal goat anti-human A-Raf antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-human MST2 antibody (Stratagene), polyclonal rabbit anti-human Bcl-xl antibody (Cell Signaling),
monoclonal mouse anti-human actin antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), monoclonal mouse anti-human tubulin
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal mouse anti-human c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal mouse anti-human Flag antibody (Sigma), monoclonal
mouse anti-human c-Raf-1 antibody (Becton Dickinson),
polyclonal rabbit anti-human B-Raf antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), monoclonal rabbit anti-human MST2 (N
terminus) antibody (Epitomics, Inc.), polyclonal rabbit
anti-human mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2] antibody
(Sigma), monoclonal mouse anti-human MAP kinase activated (diphosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2) antibody (Sigma),

antibody (8G10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal
mouse anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody (Becton Dickinson).
MST2 kinase activity assay. MST2 immunoprecipitates or
cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using gels that were
copolymerized with 0.5 mg/mL myelin basic protein. In-gel
kinase assays were performed as described previously (16),
except that after the final wash gels were soaked in 50
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 2 mmol/L
DTT for 30 min before the addition of 50 μmol/L ATP, including 1.85 MBq [γ-32P]ATP, in a total volume of 10 mL.
Apoptosis assays. Attached and floating cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed in 80% ethanol. Subsequently, cells were incubated with RNase A (10 units;
Roche) and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/mL) before
analysis on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometer (BD Clontech). Apoptosis was determined by measuring subgenomic DNA content.
Image analysis and quantification. Relative expression
levels from RT-PCRs and immunoblots were assessed using
Quantity One software according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis. Significance levels were determined
by two-tailed Student's t test analyses using Microsoft Excel.
Due to the non-normal distribution of the expression analysis data (RT-PCR), results are given as the median with the
interquartile range (IQR). For comparison of hnRNP H and
A-Raf expression between sample groups, we used the
Mann-Whitney U test. The association between hnRNP H
expression and the expression of A-Raf was tested using
Pearson correlation. All tests were two-sided and results
were considered significant if P < 0.01. Calculations were
carried out with Minitab 15 software (Minitab Ltd.).

Results
hnRNP H is overexpressed in carcinomas. hnRNP H was
overexpressed in head and neck carcinomas, whereas normal
mucosa samples displayed low levels of hnRNP H, with the

exception of an intermediate expression in cells of the basal
membrane layer (Fig. 1). hnRNP H was overexpressed in the
vast majority of head and neck carcinoma (i.e., in 60% of oropharynx, 80% of hypopharynx, 100% of larynx carcinomas,
and 67% of lymph node metastases; Supplementary Table
S1). Dysplasia of the head and neck area also showed an increase in hnRNP H expression (data not shown). In normal
tissue, hnRNP H was absent or only faintly detectable in most
human tissues, including muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and
pancreas samples. Prostate, gastric, and gut epithelium as
well as spleen and testis cells showed an intermediate expression of hnRNP H as compared with carcinoma samples
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Downregulation of hnRNP H induces apoptosis. Knockdown of hnrnp H in HeLa (cervix), GHD-1 (hypopharynx), and
HCT116 (colon) cells via RNA interference (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A and B) reduced cell numbers (Fig. 2B) by
induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by activation of caspase-3, PARP cleavage, and 10-fold increases in DNA fragmentation with up to 50% of cells displaying a pronounced sub-G1
DNA content (Fig. 2A). Decreased cell numbers could be completely rescued by exogenous hnRNP H expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and were hence not the result of offtarget effects of the siRNAs used. Transient hnRNP H overexpression also protected against etoposide-induced apoptosis
by 50% (Fig. 2C), confirming that hnRNP H has antiapoptotic
properties both under normal growth conditions and under
cytotoxic drug challenge.
A-Raf and Bcl-xl are splicing targets of hnRNP H. As
hnRNP H is a splicing factor, we performed a genome-wide
cDNA microarray screening to profile hnRNP H target
mRNAs potentially involved in apoptosis (data not shown).
Downregulation of hnRNP H caused a decrease in antiapoptotic Bcl-xl and A-Raf mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A and
B), which theoretically could promote apoptosis. hnRNP H
specifically regulated the expression of wild-type A-Raf, leaving Raf-1 or B-Raf unaffected (Fig. 3B). Transfection of A-Raf,
but not Bcl-xl, prevented apoptosis resulting from hnRNP H
repression (Fig. 3C). Double staining of hnRNP H and A-Raf

Figure 2. Knockdown of hnRNP H induces apoptosis in carcinoma cell lines. A, HeLa and GHD cells were transfected with three different hnRNP H–specific
siRNA oligonucleotides (siRNA#1–3) or scrambled control siRNA (Ctrl. siRNA) at 100 nmol/L final concentration. Top, 3 d after transfection, apoptosis
was measured by flow cytometry, assessing fragmented DNA content (sub-G1). Bottom, additionally, cells were lysed, and expression of hnRNP H,
caspase-3, and PARP was assessed by immunoblotting. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. B, numbers of HeLa and GHD-1

independent experiments; bars, SD. C, hnRNP H overexpression partly counteracts etoposide-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were transfected with
indicated amounts of a hnRNP H expression plasmid and treated with 10 μmol/L etoposide 24 h later. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the proportion

in HNSCC sections and single stainings of consecutive tumor
sections revealed a tight correlation between A-Raf and
hnRNP H expression at the single-cell level (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S3A–F).
A-Raf counteracts apoptosis by controlling MST2 activity. To test whether A-Raf mediates hnRNP H apoptosis
protection, its expression was suppressed by siRNA (Fig.
4A and B). Knockdown of a-raf caused a 3-fold reduction
in cell numbers (Fig. 4A) and an increase in apoptotic
cells similar to the levels observed after hnRNP H inhibition (Fig. 4B). Likewise, A-Raf overexpression counteracted

etoposide-mediated apoptosis comparably with hnRNP H
(Fig. 4C).
A role in tumor suppression was suggested for the
mammalian MST1/2 kinases based on their ability to induce cancer cell apoptosis (17–20). Raf-1 suppressed
MST2-mediated apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting
the enzymatic activity of MST2, whereas B-Raf barely interacted with MST2 (16). Transfection of A-Raf inhibited
MST2 kinase activity in a dose-dependent fashion
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, the knockdown of either hnrnp
h or a-raf augmented MST2 kinase activity, which was fully

prevented by complementation with an A-Raf expression
plasmid when knocking down hnRNP H (Fig. 5B). MST kinases are cleaved by caspases, releasing a 36-kDa kinase
moiety that can translocate to the cell nucleus where it
phosphorylates substrates involved in apoptotic processes
(17, 21–25). MST2 cleavage and activation of caspase-3 occurred after knockdown of hnRNP H (Supplementary Fig.
S4A and B), further confirming that the reduction of
hnRNP H expression leads to a critical deregulation of
MST2. Additionally, knockdown of either hnRNP H or ARaf resulted in the activation of caspase-3 and PARP and

an upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Puma (Supplementary Fig. S4A), indicating that downstream targets of
the MST2 pathway are activated (26). Inhibition of MST2
expression with siRNA fully abrogated apoptosis induced
by hnrnp h or a-raf knockdown, confirming that hnRNP
H and A-Raf regulation of apoptosis was MST2 dependent
(Fig. 5C).
A-Raf and MST2 interact. Raf-1–mediated inhibition of
MST2 effects was dependent on an interaction of both
proteins (16). Transfected HA–A-Raf and Flag-MST2 as
well as endogenous A-Raf and MST2 interacted (Fig. 5D).

Figure 3. hnRNP H controls bcl-x and a-raf mRNA levels and splicing, but only A-Raf antagonizes apoptosis induced by hnRNP H depletion. A,
bcl-xl/s, a-raf, and hnRNP H mRNA expression in HeLa cells was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR 4 d after transfection with control (Ctrl. siRNA)
or hnRNP H–specific siRNA (siRNA#1). gapdh mRNA levels were determined as loading controls. Shown is a representative result from three independent

Figure 4. A-Raf mediates carcinoma cell survival. A, HeLa cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L A-Raf siRNA oligonucleotides or control siRNA. Cell
numbers were assessed at the indicated time points after transfection with A-Raf or control siRNAs. Columns, mean of two independent experiments;
bars, SD. In parallel, the expression of A-Raf was monitored in whole-cell lysates for 3 d after transfection by immunoblotting. Bottom, representative results
from three independent experiments. B, apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation 3 d after transfection with A-Raf or control siRNAs. Columns,
mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. Bottom, additionally, cells were lysed, and expression of A-Raf, caspase-3, and PARP was assessed by
immunoblotting. C, A-Raf overexpression counteracts etoposide-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were transfected with increasing amounts of an A-Raf
expression plasmid (Flag-tagged A-Raf) and treated with 10 μmol/L etoposide 24 h later. Top, 72 h after transfection, the proportion of apoptotic cells was
assessed on measuring DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. Bottom, in parallel, the
expression of A-Raf was monitored in whole-cell lysates by immunoblotting.

In addition, A-Raf–K336M, a catalytically inactive mutant,
A-Raf–Y301D, a kinase-active mutant, and A-Raf–YY301/
302FF, a nonactivatable mutant, interacted with MST2 similarly as A-Raf (Supplementary Fig. S5A), hence indicating
that kinase activity is dispensable for the inhibitory effects
of A-Raf on MST2. In contrast to the interaction of Raf-1
with MST2, which is disrupted by growth factors (Supplementary Fig. S5B; ref. 16), interaction between A-Raf and
MST2 revealed largely resistant (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
As shown before (16), an interaction of the third isoform,
B-Raf, with endogenous MST2 is hardly detectable (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and may occur via heterodimerization of
B-Raf and Raf-1 (16).
Endogenous localization of A-Raf and MST2 was visualized
in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Both proteins appeared as cytoplasmic speckles, which perfectly merged in
digital overlays (Supplementary Fig. S6B). These speckles represented mitochondria as shown by costaining with cytochrome c, indicating that A-Raf–MST2 interaction occurs at
mitochondria. Importantly, the results obtained in cultured
cancer cells were corroborated in human HNSCC (Supplementary Fig. S6C). Similarly, A-Raf and hnRNP H stainings
both overlaid with cytochrome c stainings (Supplementary
Fig. S6D and E).
hnRNP H and A-Raf are both overexpressed in carcinomas. As suggested from immunohistochemistry with head

1684

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

and neck carcinomas, hnRNP H and A-Raf were both overexpressed in tumors. Next, endogenous mRNA expression
levels of hnrnp h and a-raf were analyzed in a series
(n = 29) of human Dukes B colon carcinomas and autologous adjacent nonmalignant tissues by semiquantitative
RT-PCR (Fig. 6A). As a basic principle, hnrnp h and
a-raf mRNA levels correlated, independently of the tissue
analyzed. Expression levels of hnrnph and a-raf in normal
tissue were then set to one for a comparison with the autologous carcinomas. A median relative expression of 2.6fold for hnrnph and 1.7-fold for a-raf in tumor specimens
was calculated, indicating that hnrnph and a-raf are overexpressed in carcinomas. hnrnp h overexpression significantly correlated with increased levels of a-raf at the
single patient level (rp = 0.564; P < 0.001; Fig. 6B). When
patients were divided into three groups according to their
relative expression levels of hnRNP H and a-raf mRNA in
tumor tissue (Fig. 6B), a significantly elevated number of
patients showed both high expression of hnRNP H (n =
16/29; χ2 = 21.8; P = 0.001) and a-raf (n = 11/29; χ2 =
16.7; P = 0.001; Fig. 6B). Comparing the relative expression
of hnRNP H and a-raf mRNA in normal and tumor tissues
(Fig. 6C), we found that in tumor tissues the expression of
hnRNP H (406; IQR, 278–462) was significantly higher than
in normal tissues (137; IQR, 100–290; P = 0.0001),
corresponding to a 3-fold increase. Expression of a-raf

(328; IQR, 174–404) was also significantly higher than in normal tissue (186; IQR, 138–276; P = 0.0026), corresponding to a
1.8-fold increase.

Discussion
Tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression are in part
maintained by naturally imposed proapoptotic events. Rapidly proliferating cells, including tumor cells, depend on
antiapoptotic signals that counteract intrinsic and extracel-

lular death-promoting factors to survive (27, 28). Various
carcinoma entities present an overexpression of the nuclear factor hnRNP H (11, 12). Here, we show that hnRNP H
promotes the proper generation of a-raf mRNA to express
full-length A-Raf protein. As a member of the Raf family,
A-Raf was long seen as a kinase, although with poor enzymatic potential. As a result of hnRNP H inhibition, an additional variant of a-raf mRNA was detectable, which
probably represented a shortened, alternatively spliced variant. Whether this shortened mRNA gives rise to a variant

Figure 5. hnRNP H and A-Raf suppress apoptosis via inhibition of MST2 kinase activation. A, increasing amounts of Flag–A-Raf expression plasmids
were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and MST2 immunoprecipitates were examined for kinase activity using an in-gel kinase assay. An equal
aliquot was used for immunoblotting to assure that equal amounts of MST2 had been immunoprecipitated. Lysates were immunoblotted for expression of
the transfected Flag–A-Raf and tubulin as loading control. Shown are the representative results from three independent experiments. B, HeLa cells
were transiently transfected with hnRNP H (siRNA#1), A-Raf, and control siRNAs at final concentrations of 100 nmol/L. Where indicated, A-Raf
expression plasmid (1.0 μg) was cotransfected. Top, the kinase activity of MST2 immunoprecipitates was assessed by in-gel kinase assays at days 1
and 2 after transfection. Bottom, the amount of MST2 immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates was visualized by immunoblotting. C, HeLa cells
were transfected with hnRNP H siRNA, A-Raf siRNA, or MST2 siRNA as indicated. Total amounts of siRNA were adjusted using control siRNA. Three
days after transfection, apoptosis was determined by assessing DNA fragmentation using flow cytometry. Top, columns, mean of three independent

D, A-Raf and MST2 interact in cultured cells. Left, Flag-tagged MST2 and HA-tagged A-Raf were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. Top, after
24 h, MST2 and A-Raf were immunoprecipitated (IP) with Flag tag–specific or HA tag–specific antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting (WB). Bottom,
right, lysates were immunoblotted for expression of the transfected HA–A-Raf, Flag-tagged MST2, and tubulin as loading control. Endogenous
A-Raf and MST2 were immunoprecipitated from lysates of HeLa cells, which had been serum starved (0.1% FCS, 16 h) or treated full medium (10%
FCS) after serum starvation using specific antibodies for A-Raf or MST2, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Top, as an isotype control, an antibody
specific for enolase was used. Bottom, lysates were immunoblotted for expression of A-Raf, MST2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Phospho-ERK1/2), ERK1/2,
and tubulin as loading control. HC, heavy chain immunoglobulin. Shown are representative results from three independent experiments.

Figure 6. Expression of hnRNP H and a-raf in colon carcinomas and normal adjacent tissues. A, the expression of hnRNP H and a-raf mRNA was assessed
in colon tumors (T) and normal adjacent tissues (N) by semiquantitative RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. mapk1 mRNA levels were
determined as a loading control. B, significantly elevated number of patients with high expression of hnRNP H and a-raf in tumors. The expression level of
hnRNP H and a-raf in tumor tissue was correlated to each corresponding normal tissue after standardization of all values using mapk1. Patients were
divided into three groups according to their relative expression levels of hnRNP H and a-raf mRNA in tumor tissue. Black columns (tumor < normal) indicate
tissues where expression in the tumor is lower than in normal tissues, white columns (tumor = normal) indicate no significant difference between
normal and tumor tissue, and gray columns (tumor > normal) indicate tissues where expression in the tumor is significantly higher than in normal tissues.
Shown are the numbers of patients in each group. The distribution of relative expression was calculated using the χ2 test. C, relative expression of
hnRNP H and a-raf mRNA according to disease state of the tissue. Significantly elevated expressions of hnRNP H and a-raf were observed in tumor tissues.
Shown are box plots where boxes indicate the median (line) and IQR, whiskers show the range, and asterisks indicate outliers. D, model for hnRNP
H–mediated A-Raf transcription and regulation of MST2-dependent apoptosis. hnRNP H is necessary for proper splicing of mature A-Raf. A-Raf binds to
MST2 and, thus, is a potent inhibitor of MST2-dependent apoptosis.

A-Raf protein and what functions are assigned to this potential protein remains to be elucidated.
Knowledge of a pathophysiologic role of A-Raf in cancer
cells is rather scarce when compared with Raf-1 and B-Raf.
Especially the comparatively low capacity of A-Raf to phosphorylate MAP/ERK kinase (MEK), the only widely accepted substrate for Raf kinases was suggestive of alternative
functions of A-Raf (29, 30). Our results suggest that a physiologic relevance of maintaining high-level expression of
A-Raf is to prevent apoptosis by antagonizing the proapoptotic kinase MST2. This pathway has emerged as an important mode of control of apoptosis both in Drosophila
melanogaster, where the MST2 orthologue is called Hippo
(21), and in mammals (17). Downstream MST2 substrates
such as Lats and hWW45 (called Warts and Salvador in
Drosophila melanogaster, respectively) have been identified
as tumor suppressor genes in mammals (31). Raf-1 has

1686

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

been shown to interfere with MST2 dimerization and
phosphorylation by directly binding MST2 (16). As a result,
MST2-mediated apoptosis was prevented. The B-Raf isoform did not bind MST2 and could not compensate for
Raf-1 in this respect (16). Our results show that the third
Raf family member, the A-Raf isoform (32), can efficiently
repress MST2 activity and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, this capability depends on the presence of hnRNP H,
which enhances the generation of full-length A-Raf. MST2
and A-Raf were concomitantly overexpressed and colocalized at mitochondria in cancer cell lines and also in primary human tumors. The significance of this colocalization
at mitochondria warrants further investigation but may explain why in human cancers A-Raf seems more efficient in
inhibiting MST2 proapoptotic activity than Raf-1. A role for
the potential shortened variant of A-Raf in binding MST2
is as yet unknown. A short isoform of A-Raf might lack the

ability to bind to MST2 and thus might be ineffective in
repressing apoptosis.
In mice, a-raf knockout resulted in a severe phenotype in
X −/Y males and in X −/X − females, hence in homozygous
knockouts as a-raf maps to the X chromosome. Deficient animals died within 7 to 21 days after birth, displaying abnormalities in colon organogenesis and neurologic defects
resulting in abnormal movement and proprioception. Although in vivo biochemical evidence is missing, these pathologic phenotypes seem reconcilable with increased apoptosis
due to a lack of A-Raf control over the MST2 pathway (33,
34). Inhibition of MST2 requires neither the kinase activity
of Raf-1 (16) nor the kinase activity of A-Raf. Such an antiapoptotic, kinase-independent function would be consistent
with a comparably low MEK kinase activity of A-Raf (35)
and was corroborated by the interaction of MST2 with a kinase-deficient variant of A-Raf. However, A-Raf still participates in ERK pathway as shown by double knockouts of
Raf-1 and A-Raf in mouse embryos (36), although an inverse
correlation between the kinase activity of Raf homologues

and the capacity to interact with MST2 emerges from the
data available (16).
In summary, our study presents three central findings: (a)
A-Raf is a potent inhibitor of MST2-dependent apoptosis, (b)
hnRNP H is necessary for proper splicing of mature A-Raf,
and (c) the hnRNP H–A-Raf–MST2 axis seems instrumental
in human tumors.
