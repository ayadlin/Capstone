ABSTRACT
miRNAs are a group of small RNAs that have been reported to play a key role at
each stage of tumorigenesis and are believed to have future practical value. We now
demonstrate that Bim, which stimulates cell apoptosis, is obviously down-regulated in
pancreatic cancer (PaC) tissues and cell lines. And Bim-related miR-24 is significantly
up-regulated in PaC. The repressed expression of Bim is proved to be a result of miR24, thus promoting cell growth of both cancer and vascular cells, and accelerating
vascular ring formation. By using mouse tumor model, we clearly showed that miR24 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing Bim expression in vivo.
Therefore, a new pathway comprising miR-24 and Bim can be used in the exploration
of drug-target therapy of PaC.

INTRODUCTION

unexplored.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of
small non-coding RNAs which typically consist of 22
nucleotides [7]. So far, miRNAs have been found to
be participated in various biological and pathological
processes, including metabolism, cell growth and
apoptosis, hormones secretion, aging, organic development
and immune response [8, 9]. miRNAs are also known as a
major regulator of the initiation and progression of human
cancers, and our previous study demonstrated that serum
miRNAs can be the potential biomarkers for the diagnosis
of pancreatic cancer [10].
It has been reported that miR-24 is up-regulated in
non-small cell lung cancer and leukemia and promotes
the survival and proliferation of cancer cells [11, 12],
and latest study reported that miR-24 was also involved
in mesothelial cell integration of PaC [13]. In the present
study, we found that miR-24 showed higher expression
while Bim was significantly down-regulated in pancreatic
tumor tissues. The subsequent bioinformatics analysis
and luciferase assay demonstrated that Bim is a direct
target of miR-24. Overexpression of miR-24 in PaC

Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the common
cancers worldwide, ranking forth in the causes of cancerrelated deaths in western countries [1-3], and has the
lowest survival rate ( < 5%) among all the malignancies
[3, 4]. A variety of studies have been focused on the novel
anti-PaC agents, however, the direct molecular mechanism
of cell growth, apoptosis and angiogenesis remains
unclear.
Although it has been recognized that anti-apoptotic
members of BCL-2 family (e.g., BCL2L1/BCL-xL) [5],
inhibit autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells, little
known is about the biological function of pro-apoptotic
members (e.g., BCL2L11/Bim, BID). Bim belongs to
the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family and is located in the
outer mitochondrial membrane, where it acts as a central
regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade and mediates
excitotoxic apoptosis [6]. The anti-apoptotic BCL2
members have multiple domains, while the pro-apoptotic
members of BCL2 family are BH3-only proteins. But the
role of Bim in cancers, especially in PaC, remains largely

cells depressed Bim expression, thus accelerating cell
proliferation, increasing the ratio of cells in S phase, and
reduced cell apoptosis. In vascular endothelial cells, cell
growth, apoptosis and ring formation were also proved to
be regulated by miR-24 and Bim. We finally used tumor
model mice to obtain the direct evidence that miR-24
promotes while Bim inhibits pancreatic tumor growth.
To conclude, the miR-24-Bim pathway contributes to the
complex network that activates pancreatic tumor growth
and angiogenesis, and gives novel potential target for
further therapy of PaC.

Bim is down-regulated in pancreatic cancer
tissues
Bim is known as an accelerator of cell apoptosis
[14-16]. In this study, the expression of Bim in human
PaC tissues was firstly determined by western blotting
assay. Six pairs of PaC tissues and corresponding

Bim-related miR-24 is up-regulated in both PaC
tissues and serum

noncancerous tissues were collected, and Bim was found
to be significantly down-regulated in PaC tissues (Figure
1A, 1B and 1D). The Bim protein was down-regulated by
more than 60% on average, however, the mRNA level of
Bim showed only slight decrease in PaC tissues compared
to the noncancerous tissues (Figure 1C). We detected
three isoforms of Bim with similar molecular weight (24
KD, 21 KD and 19 KD respectively). Bim is found to be
mainly expressed in cancer cells instead of stroma cells
by using IHC assays (Figure 1D). This result suggested
that the expression of Bim mainly depends on the posttranscriptional regulation in PaC.
We also evaluated Bim expression pattern by
using ‘Oncomine’ database, and it is showed that Bim
is significantly down-regulated in pancreatic carcinoma
(Supplemental Figure 1).

We have previously reported a panel of miRNAs
was dramatically changed in the serum of PaC patients
and can be a potential diagnostic tool for early stage PaC
[17]. Among the miRNAs, we found that miR-24, which
is a predicted upstream regulator of Bim, was up-regulated
in the serum of PaC patients (Supplementary Table 1). As
is predicted, miR-24 directly binds two regions in 3’UTR
of Bim mRNA (Figure 1E and 1F).
The miR-24 expression was measured by RTqPCR, and it showed great increase in PaC tissues (Figure
1G). Thus miR-24 was selected for further experimental
verification.

plasmid with a mutated sequence was used instead. And
the co-transfection of miR-24 inhibitors and the plasmid
with the WT Bim 3’UTR resulted in a relative increase in
the luciferase signal (Figure 2B and 2C).

To give the direct evidence of the interaction
between miR-24 and Bim, a luciferase assay was
performed in HEK293T cells to evaluate the association.
As is shown in Figure 2B and 2C, the relative luciferase
activity was clearly inhibited when miR-24 mimics were

To study the biological role miR-24 in PaC cells,
miR-24 mimics or inhibitors were used to interfere
the expression of miR-24. Overexpression of miR-24
by mimics lead to a sharp reduction of Bim, while the
inhibition of miR-24 slightly enhances Bim expression
(Figure 2E). It is also clear that miR-24 does not affect
Bim mRNA levels in PANC1 cells (Figure 2D).
These data demonstrated that miR-24 regulates Bim
protein levels by directly binding two separated regions in
Bim 3’UTR.

while transfection of miR-24 inhibitors suppresses cell
proliferation (Fgiure 3D).
Since the primary function of Bim is to accelerate
cell apoptosis, we also determined the apoptosis levels
of PANC1 cells using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining kit
(BD Biosciences, CA, USA). As is expected, ratio of cell
apoptosis significantly increased in FBS-free medium, and
cell apoptosis was inhibited with the transfection of miR24 mimics (Figure 3E).
It has been made clear that miR-24 plays an
important role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis and cell
cycle in PaC cell line.

miR-24 promotes cell proliferation while inhibits
cell apoptosis of PANC1 cells

Knock-down of Bim boosts cell proliferation in
PaC

To assess the role of miR-24-Bim pathway in the
process of cell growth, we used CCK8 kit to measure the
growth rate of PANC1 cells [18].
The change of cell proliferation and apoptosis are
mainly driven by cell cycle. In this study, the alteration
of cell cycle was valued by cell flow assays. Following
transfection, cells were harvested at o h, 24 h, 40 h and
48 h respectively. The cell ratios in S phase were clearly
higher, while cell ratios in G1 phase were relatively
decreased when miR-24 was up-regulated (Figure 3A, 3B
and 3C).
Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK8
assays. Overexpressed miR-24 strongly enhances

To give a clear view of Bim-regulated cell growth
and apoptosis, we used Bim siRNA to knock-down Bim
protein in PANC1 cells. As is shown Figure 4A and
4B, both the mRNA and protein of Bim were markedly
inhibited, and the Bim protein level was reduced by about
60% in PANC1 cells with the transfection of siRNA.
Subsequently, the function of Bim was also
measured. As expected, cell proliferation was promoted
while the cell apoptosis was repressed by Bim siRNA
(Figure 4C and 4D). This result approved that Bim is an
important regulator cell apoptosis and growth in PaC.

Role of miR-24-Bim pathway in angiogenesis

increased by 80% with miR-24 mediated Bim inhibition;
while cell growth rate was reduced by nearly 50% in miR24 down-regulated cells compared with the control (Figure
5F and 5G).
The main biological function of Bim is to boost
cell apoptosis, therefore, we also assessed apoptosis rate
using cell flow assays. HUVEC cells were transfected
with miR-24 mimics or inhibitors, and the medium was
removed and fresh FBS-free RPMI-1640 was added to
promote apoptosis. As is shown in Figure 5H and 5I, ratio
of cell apoptosis clearly increased without FBS compared
with control, and the apoptosis was inhibited in miR-24
overexpressed cells while was significantly enhanced in
miR-24 down-regulated cells.
These data demonstrated that the miR-24-Bim
pathway play a key role in regulating angiogenesis in PaC.

To find out the role of miR-24 in angiogenesis of
pancreatic tumors, we checked vascular ring formation
of HUVEC cells with the overexpression or knockdown
of miR-24. As is shown in Figure 5A and 5B, Bim
protein levels were reduced in HUVEC cells transfected
with miR-24 mimics, while were enhanced by miR24 inhibitors. However, the mRNA of Bim remained
unchanged (Figure 5C). Subsequently, effects of miR24 on angiogenesis were valued by endothelial tube
formation assay. It is clear shown that overexpressed miR24 promotes tube formation in HUVEC cells compared
with control; whereas the tube formation was blocked as a
result of miR-24 knockdown (Figure 5D and 5E).
Cell proliferation was valued by Edu/Dapi ration
using immunofluorescence assays, and the cell growth rate

in vivo

subcutaneously in the armpit of mice. It is observed that
the tumor sizes and weights are obviously increased in
miR-24-overexpressing group compared with control,
while the tumor growth is strongly inhibited in Bimoverexpressing group (Figure 6A and 6B). The expression
of miR-24 and Bim in tumors was measured respectively.
miR-24 raised by 4 folds and Bim raised by 3 folds in the
corresponding overexpressing groups (Figure 6C, 6D and
6E).

We also evaluate the function of miR-24 and Bim
in the growth of human PaC cell xenografts in nude mice.
The PANC1 cells were treated with lentivirus particles
to rapidly produce high intracellular levels of mature
miR-24 or Bim, and cells were harvested and injected

To access the role of miR-24 and Bim in
angiogenesis of PaC, IHC was performed using antiCD31 antibody. As is shown in Figure 6F and 6G,
CD31 expression was reduced in Bim-overexpression
group; whereas overexpressed miR-24 increased CD31
expression. This result suggests that miR-24 promotes
while Bim inhibits angiogenesis of PaC in vivo.
The tumor-implanted experiment offers a strong
confirmation that miR-24-Bim pathway effectively
regulates tumor growth in PaC, and implies that inhibition
of miR-24 is a potential novel method for anti-PaC tumor.

various types of cancer.
Taken together, we revealed an important miRNAinvolved pathway that regulates tumor cell growth,
apoptosis and tumor angiogenesis in PaC. It would
therefore be of great interest to extend miR-24 to clinical
research for the therapy of PaC as well as the other
cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals

DISCUSSION

Male nude mice (BALB/c-nu, 6~8 weeks) were
purchased from the Model Animal Center of Nanjing
University and were housed in a pathogen-free animal
facility with access to water and food and allowed to eat
and drink ad libitum. All of the experimental procedures
were performed in accordance with protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory
Committee of Nanjing University.

Dysregulation of miRNA expression in cancer has
been widely reported in both tumor tissues and serum
[19-22]. Tissue miRNAs provide an accurate diagnosis
for various types of cancer, and usually lead to disorder
of protein expression in cancer cells. In this study, Bim
expression is found to be clearly repressed in tumor tissues
of PaC, which is believed to contribute to the fast growth
rate and reduced cell apoptosis of cancer cells.
We have previously reported the serum miRNA
profile of PaC, and miR-24, which is among the predicted
Bim-related miRNAs, was found to be up-regulated [10].
We further determined the miR-24 levels in PaC tumor
tissues, and miR-24 expression is significantly increased.
Concerning that Bim mRNA is consistent in PaC, miR-24
may be the main upstream regulator of Bim. The following
experiments demonstrated that miR-24 directly targets
Bim in both PaC cells and vascular cells, inhibiting cell
apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation. The repression
of Bim in vascular cells also accelerates ring formation.
Therefore, the miR-24-Bim pathway is essential for
tumor growth in both cancer cell proliferation and tumor
angiogenesis. High expression of miR-24 in vascular cells
may be secreted from PaC cancer cells, though it needs
further evidence.
Over the past decades, chemotherapy and radiation
have focused mass cell killing without specific targeting
and often cause side effects and frequent failures[23-27].
Study on the molecular mechanism of tumor growth
usually provides potential drug targets for future clinical
application. In recent years, miRNAs or anti-miRNAs
trafficked by microvesicles (MV) or plasmids have been
used for the treatment of tumors and the other diseases in
mouse models [28-30]. As far as we know, small RNAs
can also be packed with nano-liposomes for in vivodelivery and targeted therapy.
As is reported previously, miR-24 promotes cell
proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer [31]; the high
expression of miR-24 is associated with risk of relapse and
poor survival in acute leukemia[12]; and the dysregulation
of plasma miR-24 is also treated as clinical biomarker in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [32]. Based on these reports,
we believe that miR-24 is a common oncogene among

Human tissue
Pancreatic cancer tissues and paired adjacent
noncancerous tissues were derived from patients
undergoing a surgical procedure at the Tianjin Medical
University Cancer Institute and Hospital (Tianjin, China).
Both tumor tissues and noncancerous tissues were
confirmed histologically. The pathological type of each
cancer was determined to be glandular carcinoma. Written
consent was provided by all of the patients, and the Ethics
Committee of Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute
and Hospital approved all aspects of this study. Tissue
fragments were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at
the time of surgery and stored at −80 °C.

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cell line PANC1, human embryo
kidney epithelial cell line HEK293T were cultured in
DMEM (Gibco, USA); and HUVEC was cultured in
RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA), both were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA) in a
humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
Assays to quantify mature miRNAs were conducted
as previously described with slight modifications [33,
34]. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells and
tissues using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. miRNA determination
was performed using Taqman microRNA probes (Applied

Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All of the reactions were
run in triplicate. After the reactions were complete, the
cycle threshold (CT) data were determined using fixed
threshold settings, and the mean CT was determined from
triplicate PCRs. A comparative CT method was used
to compare each condition to the control reactions. U6
snRNA was used as an internal control of miRNAs, and
The mRNA levels of Bim was normalized to GAPDH.
The relative amount of gene normalized to control was
calculated with the equation 2-ΔCT, in which ΔCT = CT geneCT control. Primers of Bim and GAPDH were as follows:
5’-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG-3’
(GAPDH,
sense); 5’-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3’(GAPDH,
antisense); 5’- CACCAGCACCATAGAAGAA-3’ (Bim,
sense); 5’- ATAAGGAGCAGGCACAGA-3’ (Bim,
antisense).

RNase A solution (5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 mg/
ml RNase A). Cells were incubated with propidium iodide
at room temperature in the dark for 1 h, then the stained
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
For cell apoptosis analysis, cells were cultured
overnight with both serum-containing complete medium
and serum-depleted medium; the attached cells and
floating cells were then harvested. Flow cytometry analysis
of apoptotic cells was carried out using an Annexin
V-FITC/PI staining kit (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). After
washes with cold PBS, the cells were resuspended in
binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,
and 25 mM CaCl2) followed by staining with Annexin
V-FITC/PI at room temperature in darkness for 15 min.
Apoptotic cells were then evaluated by gating PI and
Annexin V-positive cells on a fluorescence-activated cellsorting (FACS) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell transfection

Cell proliferation assay

Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate, and transfection
was conducted after 24 h. The miR-24 overexpressing
lentivirus, Bim overexpressing lentivirus and the control
lentivirus were bought from GenePharma (Shanghai,
China), and 106 lentivirus were added into every single
well with gentle mixing.
Cell transfection with miRNA mimics and
inhibitors were conducted by using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For each well, equal doses (100 pmol) of miRNA mimics,
inhibitors, siRNAs (Santa Cruz, sc-29802), or scrambled
negative control RNA were used. The cells were harvested
at 24 h after transfection for real-time PCR analysis and
western blotting.

PANC1 cells were collected 24 h, 48 h, 72
h, 96 h, 120 h, 144 h and 168 h post- transfection.
After transfection, 10 μL of WST-8 was added into a
corresponding test well and incubated for 4 h. Absorbance
was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm.

Immunofluorescence
HUVEC cells were incubated in 50 µM
EdU (RiboBio Inc.) for 16 h, and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min at RT. Next, the cells were
washed in PBS (2×5 min, RT) and then permeabilized
using PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min.
After extensive washes in PBS, the cells were incubated
in Apollo staining solution (RiboBio Inc.) for 20 min,
washed with NaCl/Pi (3×10 min, RT), and then incubated
in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:2500; Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min at RT.

Lucifersase assay
Part of the wild type and mutated 3’UTR of Bim,
containing the predicted miR-24 targeting regions, was
synthesized and inserted into a p-MIR-report plasmid
(Genescript, Nanjing, China). For luciferase reporter
assays, 2 mg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 2 mg
of β-galactosidase expression vector (Ambion), and equal
amounts (200 pmol) of mimics, inhibitors, or scrambled
negative control RNA were transfected into cells. And the
β-galactosidase vector was used as a transfection control.
At 24 h after transfection, cells were assasyed using
luciferase assay kit (Promega).

Angiogenesis in vitro
The in vitro endothelial tube formation assay was
performed as previously described [29, 35, 36]. Briefly,
100 μl of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) was added to each
well of a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize at 37
°C for 30 min. HUVEC cells were firstly transfected with
miR-24 mimics or inhibitors, and subsequently, cells were
resuspended in FBS-free 1640 medium and seeded in each
well at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 6 h, the
cells were examined under a light microscope to assess
the formation of capillary-like structures. The branch
points of the formed tubes, which represent the degree of
angiogenesis in vitro, were scanned and quantified in five

Cell flow assays
For cell cycle analysis, cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and fixed in 70%
ethanol at 4 °C for 2-4 h. After fixation, cells were washed
twice with PBS before resuspension in propidium iodide/
