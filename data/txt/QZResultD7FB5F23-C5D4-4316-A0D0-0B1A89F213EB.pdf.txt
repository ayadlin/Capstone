BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to determine the impact of prior coronary revascularization (angioplasty,
stent, or coronary artery bypass graft) on the risk of all-cause mortality after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) for
prostate cancer (PC) in men with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD)-induced congestive heart failure (CHF)
or myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Among 7839 men who received radiation with or without a median of 4
months of HT for PC from 1991 to 2006, 495 (6.3%) had CAD-induced CHF or MI and formed the study cohort. Of
these men, 250 (50.5%) had been revascularized before treatment for PC. Cox regression was used to determine
whether HT increased the risk of all-cause mortality, and whether revascularization altered this risk, after adjusting
for known PC prognostic factors and a propensity score for revascularization. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.1
years. Neoadjuvant HT was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (28.9% vs 15.7% at 5 years;
adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.64; P ¼ .01). Men who received HT without
revascularization had the highest risk of all-cause mortality (33.3%; adjusted HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.18; P ¼ .047),
whereas men who were revascularized and did not receive HT had the lowest risk of all-cause mortality (9.4%;
adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.93; P ¼ .028). The reference group had an intermediate risk of all-cause mortality
(23.4%) and was comprised of men in whom HT use and revascularization were either both given or both withheld.
CONCLUSIONS: In men with a history of CAD-induced CHF or MI, neoadjuvant HT is associated with an excess risk of
C 2010
mortality, which appears to be reduced but not eliminated by prior revascularization. Cancer 2011;117:406–13. V

On the basis of randomized controlled trials showing a survival benefit, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (HT) combined

with radiation is widely used in men with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (PC).1-4 However, evidence is mounting that the deleterious effects of HT on cardiovascular health may contribute to excess mortality in susceptible patients.
Specifically, a postrandomization analysis of 1 randomized trial suggested that men with moderate to severe cardiac
comorbidity based predominantly on a prior history of a myocardial infarction (MI) did not have improved survival with
the addition of HT.2 Moreover, a recent study identified the specific comorbidities that placed men at greatest risk of
excess mortality when exposed to HT, and found that men with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD)-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) or MI had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality when HT was used in addition to
radiation.5

Revascularization and Mortality With ADT/Nguyen et al

An important unanswered question concerning men
with high-risk localized or locally advanced PC and a history of CAD-induced CHF or MI is whether HT should
be delivered and if so, what can be done to eliminate the
observed excess risk of death associated with HT use.
Although coronary revascularization in men with CADinduced MI or CHF using angioplasty, stent, or coronary
artery bypass graft (CABG) is possible, there are no data
to suggest that such an approach can eliminate the
observed increased risk of all-cause mortality with HT
use. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine
the impact of prior coronary revascularization on the
increased risk of all-cause mortality associated with neoadjuvant HT in men with a history of CAD-induced CHF
or MI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment
From 1991 to 2006, 7839 consecutive men received
brachytherapy-based radiation with or without a median
of 4 months of neoadjuvant HT for localized or locally
advanced PC at 1 of 20 US community-based practices
located in Florida, New York, and North Carolina.
Among these men, 495 (6.3%) had a history of CADinduced CHF or MI and a minimum of 1-year follow-up
and comprised the study cohort. Among the cohort, 250
(50.5%) had undergone revascularization (angioplasty,
CABG, or stenting) before presentation.
Decisions about adjuvant therapies were typically
based on the American Brachytherapy Society guidelines,
which recommend brachytherapy alone for low-risk disease and suggest the use of supplemental external beam
radiotherapy (EBRT) when there is a significant risk of
extraprostatic extension.6 Neoadjuvant HT was generally
used in the setting of unfavorable-risk disease, and typically only used in the setting of favorable-risk disease if it
was needed to downsize the prostate to eliminate pubic
arch interference so brachytherapy would be technically
feasible.
Neoadjuvant HT consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with or without an antiandrogen and was given before brachytherapy. EBRT was
generally delivered using photons in 25 1.8 gray [Gy] fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles, for a total dose
of 45 Gy using computed tomography-based simulation
and a 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated
radiotherapy technique. The pelvic lymph nodes were not
included in the EBRT volume. Brachytherapy was per-

formed using a peripheral loading technique using preloaded iodine-125, palladium-103, or cesium-131
sources and preplanned dosimetry. The prescribed minimum peripheral doses used were consistent with accepted
standards within the United States. Specifically, they were
144, 108, and 115 Gy, respectively, for iodine-125, palladium-103, and cesium-131 when used as monotherapy
and 108, 90, and 100 Gy, respectively, when used in conjunction with 45 Gy of supplemental EBRT.
Prostate needle biopsy specimens underwent review
by a pathologist with expertise in genitourinary pathology
at each center. In accordance with federal and institutional
guidelines, all research was conducted under an institutional review board-approved protocol permitting collection and analysis of deidentified patient data at baseline
and follow-up. The data collection on the study patients
was performed by a team of data managers and was overseen by a biostatistician at each facility.
Ascertainment of Comorbidities
For each patient, as part of the initial consultation, the
treating physician systematically assessed for the presence
or absence of CAD risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and CADinduced conditions, including CHF or MI. This information was initially ascertained from medical records provided by referring physicians and then confirmed through
verbal communication with each patient at the time of initial consultation. Although no specific diagnostic criteria
or threshold laboratory levels were enforced by the study,
it was assumed that each patient’s primary care physician
or cardiologist used up-to-date, evidence-based diagnostic
criteria set forth by national, consensus panel statements
for each comorbid condition.
Follow-Up
Follow-up started on the day of prostate brachytherapy
and concluded on the date of death or the date of last follow-up for patients still alive. Patients were generally seen
every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for an additional 4 years, and then annually thereafter. At each follow-up, a history and physical examination including a
digital rectal examination was performed in addition to a
serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level measurement
before the digital rectal examination. At the time of PSA
failure, in addition to the routine follow-up assessment, a
pelvic computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging and a bone scan were also obtained. Salvage therapy consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone

agonist, which was typically initiated within 1 year after
PSA recurrence and always before symptomatic or radiographic progression.
All deaths from PC were confirmed using either the
National Death Index or attending report.

Statistical Methods
Comparison of the distribution of baseline
patient and tumor characteristics across
treatment modalities

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the
clinical characteristics of the study cohort at baseline and
are shown in Table 1, stratified by the use of neoadjuvant
HT. A Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used to compare the distribution of categorical covariates at baseline
among men who received HT versus those who did not
receive HT. For continuous covariates, including the serum PSA levels, and age at and year of treatment, medians
and their distributions were compared across strata using
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Table 2 uses similar methodology, but the stratification is based on whether men underwent a revascularization procedure.

Risk of all-cause mortality

Cox multivariate regression was used to evaluate
whether neoadjuvant HT use was significantly associated
with the risk of all-cause mortality, adjusting for known
PC prognostic factors (clinical T classification, Gleason
score, PSA), whether EBRT was added, and a treatment
propensity score for EBRT that incorporated information
about PC prognostic factors, age at brachytherapy, and
year of brachytherapy.7 Propensity analysis required calculation of a conditional probability for the 2 treatment
groups (brachytherapy alone or brachytherapy with supplemental EBRT) using a multivariate logistic regression
model.8
A second Cox model assessed whether prior revascularization affected the risk of all-cause mortality because
of neoadjuvant HT use, after adjusting for the same covariates as in the prior model, except that the treatment propensity score was constructed to account for the
propensity for receiving revascularization. This revascularization propensity score contained information about age
at brachytherapy, year of brachytherapy, and whether the
patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, or of both CHF
and MI versus either alone. The adjusted risk of all-cause
mortality was compared within 4 groups defined based on
whether patients were revascularized or received HT: 1)
revascularization plus no HT, 2) revascularization plus

HT, 3) no revascularization plus no HT, and 4) no revascularization plus HT. Given that the adjusted risk of allcause mortality was not significantly different in the initial
adjusted model between groups 2 and 3 (adjusted P ¼
.87), these 2 groups were collapsed in the final model and
served as the baseline group to which the other 2 groups
(1 and 4) were compared.
For the Cox models, an event was defined as death
from any cause. PSA level was log transformed to ensure
it followed a normal distribution and was treated as a
continuous variable. For the categorical variables of
Gleason score (6, 7, 8-10) and tumor category (T1c,
T2, T3), cutpoints were determined before the analysis
on the basis of established clinically relevant strata.
Baseline groups for those categorical variables were
defined as Gleason score 6 or less and clinical category
T1c, respectively. The assumptions of the Cox model
were tested, and no evidence that these assumptions
were violated was found. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality with associated
95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P values were calculated for each covariate.

Estimates of all-cause mortality stratified by
treatment(s) received

RESULTS

For the purpose of illustration, the method of
Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate all-cause mortality
(defined as 1 minus the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall
survival) and stratified by whether neoadjuvant HT was
used.9 Comparisons of these estimates were also made
across the 3 groups as previously defined based on whether
a revascularization procedure was performed and whether
neoadjuvant HT used. Time zero was defined as the day
of prostate brachytherapy. Comparisons of these estimates
across cohorts defined by the treatment received were performed using the log-rank test,10 and adjustment for multiple comparisons was made using the Bonferroni
method.11 For the revascularization/HT groups, given
that there were 3 possible log-rank pairwise comparisons
across the 3 groups, a Bonferroni corrected significance
level of .05/3 ¼ .017 was used.
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used
for all calculations.

Description of Study Cohort
Of the 7839 men, the study cohort was comprised of the
495 (6.3%) patients with a history of CAD-induced CHF
or MI. Men with low-risk PC (clinical category T1c/T2a,
Gleason 6, and PSA <10) accounted for 44% of the
cohort, and men with intermediate-risk PC (T2b, PSA
10-20, or Gleason 7) accounted for 39%, whereas men
with high-risk PC (T2c or higher, Gleason 8-10, or PSA
>20) comprised only 17% of the study cohort.12
Among these 495 men, 250 (50.5%) had been revascularized before presentation, and 315 (63.6%) received
neoadjuvant HT. As seen in Table 1, when compared
with men who did not receive neoadjuvant HT, the
patients who received neoadjuvant HT had more unfavorable PC prognostic factors, including higher PSA (P ¼
.0001), a greater proportion of high-grade disease (P <
.001), and higher T category (P ¼ .042), which all contribute to men receiving HT being in higher risk groups

HT Use and the Risk of All-Cause Mortality in
Men With a History of CHF or MI
After a median follow-up of 4.1 years (interquartile range,
2.7-6.6), 126 (25.4% of 495) men died. As shown in
Table 3, neoadjuvant HT was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR,
1.73; 95% CI, 1.13-2.64; P ¼ .01) in men with a history
of CHF or MI. No other covariates were significantly
associated with the risk of all-cause mortality.
For illustrative purposes, estimates of all-cause mortality stratified by whether neoadjuvant HT was administered are shown in Figure 1. The 5-year estimate of allcause mortality for men who received HT was 28.9%
(95% CI, 22.8-36.3), and for those who did not receive
HT it was 15.7% (95% CI, 9.8-24.6).

HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.93; P ¼ .028). The reference
group had an intermediate risk of all-cause mortality, and
was comprised of men in whom HT and revascularization
were both given or both withheld. Those 2 groups were
combined to form the reference group, because their
adjusted risk of all-cause mortality did not differ from
each other (P ¼ .87).
Figure 2 illustrates estimates of all-cause mortality
based on whether a revascularization procedure was performed and whether neoadjuvant HT was used. The 5-year
estimate of all-cause mortality for men who received HT and
were not revascularized was 33.3% (95% CI, 24.6-44.0).
For men in whom revascularization and HT were both given
or those in whom neither was given, it was 23.4% (95% CI,
17.1-31.5), and for those who received revascularization but
not HT, it was 9.4% (95% CI, 3.8-22.5).

Figure 2. Estimates of all-cause mortality stratified by revascularization and neoadjuvant hormone therapy (HT) use are
shown. The groups were defined as follows: Group 1, HT use
and no revascularization; Group 2, HT use and revascularization or no HT and no revascularization; and Group 3, revascularization and no HT. The following pairwise log-rank P values
were determined: Groups 1 versus 2, .0674; Groups 2 versus
3, .0295; and Groups 1 versus 3, .0006.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that among men receiving brachytherapy for PC, those with a prior history of CADinduced CHF or MI (representing 6.3% of this group)
were at increased risk for all-cause mortality when treated
with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy after adjusting for
age, known PC prognostic factors, and a treatment

propensity score. This result is concordant with a prior
study that also found that men with a history of CADinduced CHF or MI (5.0% of that population) were at
increased risk of all-cause mortality when treated with
neoadjuvant HT.5
In addition, we attempted to determine how prior
revascularization impacted the increased risk of all-cause
mortality attributed to HT use in men with a history of
CAD-induced CHF or MI. We found that HT use without revascularization was associated with the highest risk
of all-cause mortality. An intermediate risk of all-cause
mortality was seen for HT use with revascularization or
HT avoidance without revascularization. However, the
lowest risk of all-cause mortality was seen for HT avoidance with revascularization. This suggests that prior revascularization reduced but could not completely eliminate
the excess risk of mortality associated with HT use in men
with a history of CAD-induced CHF or MI.
In current practice, neoadjuvant HT is given to up
to 25% to 50% of patients with low-risk PC undergoing
brachytherapy in an attempt to shrink the prostate gland
to make the procedure more technically feasible, but there
is no evidence in the literature that neoadjuvant
HT reduces PC-specific mortality in men with low-risk
PC.13-17 Therefore, the data from this study suggest that
neoadjuvant HT for gland size reduction should not be
considered for men with low-risk disease and a history of
CAD-induced CHF or MI, even if they have been
revascularized.
For patients with unfavorable-risk PC (intermediate
or high risk), there are several randomized trials showing
that adding HT to radiation improves overall survival.1,2,18 However, it is possible that not all subgroups of
patients in a randomized trial benefit from an intervention
even if an overall effect is seen. Specifically, a postrandomization analysis of 1 of those trials suggested that the benefit of HT appeared to be limited to those with no or mild
comorbidity (76% of the study cohort) on the validated
ACE-27 scale; those with moderate or severe comorbidity
(24% of the study cohort) did not benefit from the addition of HT, and had a nonsignificant decrement in survival when HT was given (8-year overall survival 25%
with HT, 54% without HT, P ¼ .08).2,19 The current
study identifies men with a history of CAD-induced CHF
or MI as a subgroup that may be harmed by HT and suggests that this harm can be reduced but not completely
eliminated by prior revascularization.
Therefore, these data raise the possibility that for
men with unfavorable-risk PC, clinicians may need to be

selective about which men are offered HT, and will particularly need to individualize care for men with a history of
CAD-induced CHF or MI. This study did not have
enough men with high-risk PC (17% of the cohort) to
perform an adequately powered analysis within that
group, and it may be possible that for patients with CADinduced CHF or MI who have very aggressive PC characteristics, the known benefit of HT on prostate-specific
survival may be large enough outweigh the suggested decrement of HT on non–PC-specific survival. This may be
particularly true for patients who have been revascularized, as this seemed to reduce the harms caused by HT.
One limitation of this study is that because of its
retrospective nature, it is not possible to prove that HT
increased the risk of all-cause mortality or that prior revascularization truly modified this risk, but rather we
could only show significant associations between these
observations. Future randomized studies of PC interventions should be stratified before randomization by cardiac
comorbidity and risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidity, and in particular by a history of CHF or MI, to
help determine precisely which patients are helped and
harmed by additional interventions. In addition, the
mechanism by which neoadjuvant HT is increasing the
risk of all-cause mortality remains uncertain. The observation that men who had been revascularized had a partial reduction in the excess risk of all-cause mortality
suggests that the coronary vessels may play a role in the
underlying mechanism, but there are most likely other
mechanisms as well that are distinct from the coronary
vessels. Further work will be needed to characterize these
mechanisms. Finally, the median duration of HT was
only 4 months, and so it is unknown from this study
what the implications of longer-course HT would be on
cardiovascular outcomes.
In summary, in patients with a history of CADinduced CHF or MI, neoadjuvant HT is associated with
an excess risk of all-cause mortality that appears to be
reduced but not eliminated by prior revascularization.
Therefore, neoadjuvant HT should not be considered for
men with low-risk PC and a prior history of CHF or MI
regardless of whether they have been revascularized. Decisions about neoadjuvant HT use in men with unfavorable
risk PC and a history of CHF or MI should be
individualized.
