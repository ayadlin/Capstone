ABSTRACT
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), a key metabolic enzyme involved in
aerobic glycolysis, is highly expressed in many solid tumors. Small molecule compound
DAP (2,2-dichloroacetophenone) is a potent inhibitor of PDK1. Whether targeting
PDK1 with DAP can inhibit acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and how it works remains
unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of inhibition of PDK1 with DAP on cell
growth, apoptosis and survival in AML cells and identified the underlying mechanisms.
We found that treatment with DAP significantly inhibited cell proliferation, increased
apoptosis induction and suppressed autophagy in AML cells in vitro, and inhibited
tumor growth in an AML mouse model in vivo. We also showed that inhibition of
PDK1 with DAP increased the cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins (PARP and Caspase
3) and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-xL and BCL-2)
and autophagy regulators (ULK1, Beclin-1 and Atg). In addition, we found that DAP
inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDK1
interacted with ULK1, BCL-xL and E3 ligase CBL-b in AML cells, and DPA treatment
could inhibit the interactions. Collectively, our results indicated that targeting PDK1
with DAP inhibited AML cell growth via multiple signaling pathways and suggest that
targeting PDK1 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs.

INTRODUCTION

are older than 60 years have even poorer prognoses (5year survival rates <10%).[1] In recent years, inhibitors
of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) have emerged as
promising treatment options for AML. However, only
35% of AML patients have acquired a FLT3 mutation.[2]
Therefore, it is of importance to discover and identify new
key regulators that are widely expressed in the majority of
AML patients.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by
the deregulated proliferation of immature myeloid cells.[1]
Nearly 80% of adult leukemias are AMLs with a median
age at diagnosis of 65 years.[1] The majority of AML
patients who receive intensive chemotherapy can achieve
complete remission. However, the relapse rates are high,
and the overall five-year survival rate is 20%. Patients who

Nearly 80 years ago, Otto Warburg discovered that
the majority of tumor cells favor aerobic glycolysis even
when oxygen is plentiful. This phenomenon was later
termed the Warburg effect. Warburg hypothesized that this
metabolic dysfunction caused the development of tumors.
[3] The most sensitive clinical diagnostic tool for cancer
is positron emission tomography (PET) because aerobic
glycolysis is crucial for most tumor cells. Recently, the
study of tumor metabolism has been revived. Pyruvate
kinase M2 (PKM2) is expressed predominantly in tumor
cells [4, 5] and is important for tumor growth because it is
the rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. PKM2
catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP
into pyruvate and ATP. Other researchers discovered that
the inhibition of key kinases in the glycolysis pathway
has strong anti-tumor effects, [6, 7] and the inhibition of
PKM2 markedly induces apoptosis in breast tumor cells.
[8]
Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) is the key
metabolic enzyme involved in aerobic glycolysis, and it
has been found to be overexpressed in many tumors. [9,
10] PDK1 acts as a gate keeper that regulates the flux of
pyruvate from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. [9]
By inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, PDK1
decouples glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation.
PDK1 overexpression may inhibit mitochondrial
function, which may lead to resistance to apoptosis. The
inhibition of PDK sensitizes both wild type and BCL-2overexpressing cancer cells to radiation by interacting
with BCL-2. [11] Recent study has also demonstrated that
the prognosis is poor for gastric cancer patients who have
high levels of PDK1.[12]
PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) has been
reported to inhibit PDK1 signaling and exert strong antitumor effects in glioblastoma. Therefore, we inferred
that PDK1 is important for tumor cell survival. Based
on the results of previous studies [11, 13, 14]. DCA is
a relatively weak inhibitor of PDK1, and millimolar
(mM) concentrations of DCA are required to achieve the
desired effects. Some studies has shown DCA is toxic
(ie neuropathy), which has resulted in some clinical
trials being halted [15, 16]. Because it is difficult to
avoid off-target effects at mM concentrations, it is
necessary to identify stronger inhibitors. Importantly,
2,2-dichloroacetophenone (DAP) is a much more potent
inhibitor of PDK1. It is effective at concentrations in the
micromolar (μM) range.
In established cancer cells, autophagy is often
induced as an alternative source of energy and metabolites.
[17] When cancers are treated with HDAC inhibitors or
rapamycin, autophagy is often induced as a pro-survival
strategy.[18, 19] These previous studies suggested that
inhibiting autophagy could sensitize cancer cells to HDAC
inhibitors or rapamycin. Moreover, Chen et al.[19 ]
discovered that the suppression of ATG5, ATG6, or ATG7
and co-treatment with bafilomycin A1 sensitized various
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumors to several anti-cancer drugs and therapies.
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is one of the major
cellular survival pathways. The constitutive activation of
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been reported to be a
common feature in AML patients. [20, 21] This pathway
also controls the membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter, multidrug resistance associated protein
1. For these reasons, many small molecules, such as
rapamycin and PI-103, [22, 23] have been developed
to target this pathway. However, for the most part, the
results of the clinical trials that have been performed
with these compounds have been disappointing. [24, 25]
The outcomes of these clinical trials suggest that tumor
cells may bypass the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, there is
an urgent need to identify a more promising target that
is essential for cancer cell survival. Akt also regulates
aerobic glycolysis. [26] 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase-1 may phosphorylate and activate Akt, [27
]but it is unclear if pyruvate dehydrogenase has an effect
on the PI3K/Akt pathway.
In this study, we investigated the role of targeting
PDK1 with DAP in the regulation of the growth and
survival of AML cells and identified the underlying
mechanisms of actions. Our study suggests that PDK1
may be a promising therapeutic target for AML.

RESULTS
DAP suppressed cell proliferation in vitro in AML
cell lines
We first evaluated the effects of PDK1 inhibitor
DAP on cell growth in AML U937 and Raji cell lines.
The cells were treated with the increasing concentrations
of DAP at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μM for 24,
48 or 72 hours. The cell viability was measured using
a CCK-8 assay. As shown in Figure 1A, DAP at 5 μM
slightly inhibited cell growth, but DAP at 10 μM or higher
concentrations significantly inhibited cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values were 14.0 µM
for U937 cells and 24.4 µM for Raji cells. However, DAP
treatment had no significant inhibition on cell viability in
the normal blood cells (PBMCs) (Figure 1B). Because the
U937 cell line was more sensitive to DAP than Raji cell
line, we chose this AML cell line as a model to study the
molecular mechanism by which DAP targeted PDK1 to
inhibit AML growth. Microscopy analysis also revealed
that the number of cells decreased in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 1C). We also examined the
effects of PDK1 inhibition on colony formation using soft
agar colony formation assays. The number of colonies
decreased as the concentration of DAP increased (Figure
1D).

DAP suppressed tumor growth in vivo in an AML
mice model

DAP induced apoptosis and inhibited PDK1
experssion in AML cells

To confirm the inhibition of DAP in AML cell
growth and survival, we analyzed the effects of DAP
treatment on tumorigenicity in vivo using a AML xenograft
mouse model. U937 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the nude mice, and the visible tumors developed at the
injection sites after 4 days. DAP was then subcutaneously
injected for two weeks. As shown in the growth curve in
Figure 1A, DAP treatment markedly suppressed tumor
growth (Figure 2A). At 12 days, the tumors were taken
out and weighted. DAP effectively inhibited the tumor
volumes (Figure 2B) and tumor weights (Figure 2C) as
compared to the control group (p=0.0023). However,
treatment with DAP did not affect significantly the body
weight weights of the mice (p=0.7307) (Figure 2D).

We next analyzed the effect of DAP on apoptosis by
flow cytometry. Based on the results of our preliminary
screening using the CCK-8 assay, we selected 5, 20,
and 80 µM DAP as the representative doses for the next
experiments. After 24 h of exposure to DAP, U937 cells
were subjected to Annexin V-PI double staining and
analyzed by flow cytometry. DAP treatment resulted
in a significant increase in the proportion of Annexin
V-positive apoptic cells (Figure 3A). Interestingly,
we found that DAP induced late apoptosis in a dosedependent manner but not any change for early apoptosis
(Figure 3A). In addition, DAP induced the cleavage of the
pro-apoptotic proteins PARP and caspase-3 in U937 cells
(Figure 3B). We also found that DAP treatment decreased

from healthy donors, were treated with the increasing concentrations of DAP (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 uM) for 24 h. Cell viability

the protein levels of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
proteins, namely BCL-XL and BCL-2, and up-regulated
the expression of the apoptotic proteins BAX (Figure 3C).
Moreover, we showed that in U937 cells treatment with
DAP markedly inhibited the expression of PDK1 protein
(Figure 3B), implying that DAP inhibited AML cell
growth and induced apoptosis through PDK1 signaling
pathway.
To further confirm whether the influence of DAP on
cells survival was through targeting PDK1, the U937 cells
were pre-transfected with PDK1 siRNA for 48 h to inhibit
the PDK1 singaling first, and then followed by the addition
DAP. After 24 h, cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK8 assay. As shown in Figure 3D, knockdown of PDK1
by siRNA or treatment with DAP alone considerably
inhibited cell proliferation. However, the addition of DAP
did not dramatically increased the proliferation inhibition
induced by PDK1 siRNA in AML cells as compared
with the treatment with DAP alone, implying that DAP

regulated AML cell growth by targeting PDK1 signaling.

DAP suppressed autophagy in AML cells
Cell autophagy plays an important role in tumor
growth. We next tested whether the DAP-mediated
inhibition of AML cell growth is due to the regulation of
autophagy. The U937 cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of DAP for 24 h and autophagy was
detected using acridine orange staining and flow
cytometry. The results showed that the number of
autophagic vesicles decreased as the concentration of
DAP increased (Figure 4A). The changes in the expression
levels of autophagy-regulating proteins were measured by
Western blotting analyses. The expression of the early
stage autophagy regulators, namely ULK1, Beclin-1,
Atg 5 and Atg 7, was significantly inhibited by DAP in a
dose-dependent manner, and also the LC3-I converted to

II (Figure 4B). We then performed Co-IP to test if PDK1
could target and interact with the autophagy regulatory
protein ULK1 and DAP treatment could inhibited this
interaction. As shown in Figure 4C, a clear interaction

between PDK1 and ULK1 was detected in AML cells, and
treatment with DAP considerably inhibited the expression
of ULK1, thereby decreasing the amount of ULK1 protein
which interacted with PDK1.

DAP inactivated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in
AML cells

DAP at the doses of 5, 20, or 80 µM for 24 h and the
proteins were detected by Western blot assay. As shown in
Figure 5A, the levels of Akt, phospho-Akt, PI3K, phosphoPI3K and mTOR proteins were markedly inhibited
by DAP. To verify the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
is involved in the DAP-mediated inhibition of AML
cells. We pre-treated U937 cells with the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 at 50 uM to block the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway and followed the treatment with DAP. As shown

The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is implicated in
AML cell growth and survival. We next determined the
effect of DAP on the regulation of the key molecules
involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway in the Aktoverexpressing U937 cells. The cells were treated with

in Figure 5B, treatment with LY294002 alone significantly
inhibited U937 cell proliferation, so we chosen the dose
of 50 uM for our next experiments. The addition of DAP
did not dramatically affect the LY294002-mediated
inhibition of proliferation compared to the treatment with
LY294002 or DAP alone. Moreover, neither LY294002

nor chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagy, decreased the
level of PI3K protein expression. Only DAP treatment
decreased PI3K protein expression levels (Figure 5C).
Based on these observations, we postulated that PDK1
stabilized PI3K and that the inhibition of PDK1 promoted
PI3K degradation. To text this possibility, we pre-treated

U937 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and
followed the treatment with DAP. As shown in Figure 5D,
MG132 could inhibit U937 cell proliferation, however,
combination with DAP, there was no obvious difference
between 1 µM MG132 and 10 µM MG132. And also, we
detected the protein levels of PI3K and PDK1, as well as
relative proteins. As shown in Figure 5E, pre-treatment
with MG132, the degradation of PI3K and PDK1 was
significantly decreased.

AML cells. After treatment with DAP, the interaction
between PDK1 and BCL-xL was decreased, but the
interaction between BCL-xL and mTOR did not change
(Figure 6C). Both BCL-2 (anti-apoptotic member of the
BCL-2 family) and BAX (pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family
member) interacted with PI3K. After exposure to DAP,
the interactions between PI3K and both BCL-2 and BAX
increased dramatically (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION

DAP inhibited the interaction of PDK1 with
CBL-b, Akt and BCL-xL

In the present study, we demonstrated that the DAP
strongly inhibited cell growth via inhibiting PDK1 in
many different AML cell lines, which suggest that PDK1
inhibition has a broad spectrum of anti-tumor effects.
We found that the canonical PI3K/Akt survival pathway
was also inhibited by DAP, and this inhibition decreased
the post-translational modifications and reduced the
expression levels of key regulatory proteins. In our study,
we also demonstrated that the CBL-b E3 ligase interacted
with PDK1 and ULK1 and that CBL-b levels were not
significantly altered when the cells were exposed to DAP.
Autophagy protects tumor cells from death when
they are challenged with starvation or other distresses
[29, 30]. ULK1 (Unc-51 like kinase1) is a key molecule
involved in triggering autophagy initiation. ULK1 is

We next determined the potential molecular targets
of PDK1 which interact with PDK1 and assessed the
effect of DAP on their interactions in AML cells by Co-IP
assay. We found that the E3 ligase CBL-b could interact
with PDK1 and the autophagy regulatory protein ULK1
(Figure 6A). Treatment with DAP effectively abolished the
interaction of CBL-b with PDK1 or ULK1 (Figure 6A).
We also detected the interaction of PDK1 with Akt or Erk
and found that treatment with DAP considerably inhibited
the expression of Akt, thereby decreasing the amount of
Akt protein which interacted with PDK1 (Figure 6B).
BCL-xL is involved in AML proliferation. We next
detected the interaction between PDK1 and BCL-xL in

suggested to have a significant contribution in controlling
autophagy. [31] In our study, we showed that DAP induced
cell apoptosis and suppressed cell autophagy though
inhibiting PDK1 and ULK1 expression, respectively.
Recently, it has also been shown that both PDK1 and
ULK1 affect the function of mitochondria. [9, 32] mTOR
is known to suppress ULK1, and BCL-2 is known to
suppress Beclin-1. [33, 34] Therefore, autophagy may
be activated or enhanced when PI3K/mTOR and BCL2 are strongly inhibited. Here, we hypothesized that
PDK1 might interact with these factors, and then have
effects on mitochondria. However, our results indicated
that DAP decreased autophagy. The protein levels of
ULK1 and Beclin-1 were reduced when PDK1 was
inhibited, indicating that the PDK1-mediated regulation

of autophagy may be independent of PI3K/mTOR and
BCL-2. The results of the Co-IP experiments verified our
hypotheses and showed that PDK1 interacted with ULK1.
Because PDK1 regulates the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, PDK1 may also regulate autophagy. Both of
these pathways provide important building blocks for
tumor cells, and these two pathways require coordination.
Therefore, PDK1 may be one of these signal hubs.
When LY294002 was added to the cells, the DAPmediated inhibition of proliferation was blocked, thereby
indicating that PDK1 required PI3K and mTOR activity to
carry out its function. Furthermore, neither LY294002 nor
chloroquine decreased the protein levels of PI3K, but DAP
reduced the levels of PI3K. Based on these observations,
we postulated that PDK1 stabilized PI3K and that the

Figure 7: The model for the role of PDK1 in AML cell growth. A. When PDK1 is active, it blocks the CBL-b E3 ligase and
prevents the degradation of oncoproteins, such as ULK1, Akt, PI3K, and BCL-xL, by the proteasome. PI3K binds to BCL-2 and blocks
BAX oligomerization. B. When PDK1 is inhibited by DAP, the CBL-b E3 ligase releases from PDK1, and the ULK1, Akt, PI3K, and BCLxL oncoproteins are degraded. PDK1 itself is also degraded. Meanwhile, PI3K releases BCL-2, translocates BAX to the mitochondria and
allows the BAX oligomerization, thereby inducing apoptosis.

Our animal experiments showed that DAP inhibited
tumor growth as compared to controls, but was unable
to completely inhibit tumor growth. Additional research
is required, and more connections between apoptosis
and tumor metabolism must be identified before PDK1
inhibition can be used in a clinical setting.
Based on the data obtained in the present study, we
propose the model depicted in Figure 7. In tumor cells,
PDK1 acts as a brake blocking the CBL-b E3 ligase,
thereby preventing the degradation of key oncoproteins,
such as PI3K and BCL-xL, by proteasome. When PDK1
is inhibited by DAP, the inhibition of the CBL-b E3
ligase is decreased, which promotes the degradation of
PDK1. Following PDK1 degradation, the levels of Akt,
PI3K, BCL-xL, BCL-2, mTOR, and ULK1 are also
decreased, and the interactions between these proteins
become increasingly weaker. In addition, BAX loses its
abilities to inhibit BCL-2 and BCL-xL, translocate to the
mitochondria, and induce apoptosis. Because ULK1, the
key regulator of autophagy, is reduced, it becomes difficult
for tumor cells to up-regulate autophagy and restore
survival.
Previous research has been found that PDK1
is associated with various types of cancers including
melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer,
prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer
[35]. Most researchers adopted tumortransplantation
mouse model to study PDK1 expression on tumor
growth. In this study, we also analyzed the effect of
DAP treatment on tumorigenicity in vivo using a U937
cells AML xenograft mouse model. Our data showed
that DAP treatment markedly suppressed tumor growth.
However, the deviation of tumors in the treatment group
are much smaller than those in the control group at the
end point (Day 12), while the deviation of tumors in the
control group is smaller than the DAP treatment group.
That is because the tumor size for each mouse in the DAP
treatment group was small and we measured the tumor
size outside the skin of mice, the deviation in the DAP
treatment group was smaller than those in the control
group.
In addition, in our study, at day-1 after treatment,
the tumor volumes of xenograft are a little bit different
between the control group and treatment group. The
tumor volumes of the control group have been over 1000
mm3 after 4-day cell injection and drug injection for 2
weeks, and rapidly increased to 6000 mm3 within 12
days. Therefore, it would be better if the record of tumor
growth shown in the graph started from the time point
when the tumors formed and were treated with DAP.
Moreover, an in vivo model such as NRas/Bcl-2 AML may
be more relevant than U937 xenografts and the Western
blot data from tumors for the same signaling pathways
would strengthen this paper.Oxidative stress in AML and
drug response is of key interest in the field. The assays to
address the oxidative stress response and/or DNA damage

inhibition of PDK1 promoted PI3K degradation. However,
we discovered that the inhibition of PDK1 reduced the
protein levels of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and Erk. We found it is
difficult to explain using a model whereby PDK1 stabilizes
PI3K. Therefore, we postulated that PDK1 decreased the
degradation of some onco-proteins, such as Akt. When the
MG132 proteasome inhibitor was added, the degradation
of PI3K and PDK1 was significantly decreased, thereby
suggesting that PDK1 may be coupled with the ubiquitin
degradation system and act as a brake. In addition, we
found that both PDK1 and ULK1 interacted with the
CBL-b E3 ligase. Based on our data, we suggest that
PDK1 blocks the E3 ligase-dependent degradation of key
oncoproteins.
Elstrom et al. [26] reported that Akt-expressing
cancer cells up-regulate the rate of aerobic glycolysis,
and we demonstrated that Akt directly interacted with
PDK1, which may explain why tumors shut down their
mitochondria to achieve apoptotic resistance and upregulate survival proteins, such as Akt. PDK1 may be
located at a pivotal position in coordinating these two
tasks.
Following the induction of apoptosis, the
interactions between PDK1 and Erk, Akt, and BCL-xL
decreased, but BCL-xL remained bound to mTOR. The
DAP-induced decreased expression of BCL-xL may have
disrupted the interaction between PI3K and mTOR. Our
co-IP data suggested that PI3K may have caused the
release of BCL-2 from the mitochondria, assisted in Bax
oligomerization, and released procaspase-8.
PDK1 not only acts as a metabolic enzyme but also
as an oncogene protecting tumor cells from apoptosis.
Based on the results of our study, we inferred that PDK1
protected BCL-2, BCL-xL, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR from
degradation and that the persistent stabilization of these
proteins made the tumor cells resistant to apoptosis, thus
conferring survival advantages. PI3K was one of the
proteins protected from degradation, and PI3K was found
to be a major mediator of PDK1 activation (see Figure 7) .
Inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
by PDK1 is crucial to maintain energy homeostasis.
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a relatively weak inhibitor of
PDK1 and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in
glioblastoma. However, some studies with DCA proved
this compound to be toxic (ie neuropathy). In our study,
we demonstrated that 2,2-dichloroacetophenone (DAP)
is a much more potent inhibitor of PDK1. It is effective
at concentrations in the micromolar (μM) range. We did
not anticipate that the inhibition of PDK1 would cure
cancer. Instead, we were searching for potential processes
and targets that are vital to cancer based on the literature.
We believed that PDK1 may be one such target and that
tumor metabolism was one of these vital processes. PDK1
inhibition has been shown to have powerful and broad
spectrum anti-tumor effects in vitro, and these effects
are relatively unique compared to tyrosinase inhibitors.

Analysis of apoptosis

to DAP would be important to investigate the metabolic
effects of PDHK inhibition on these cells.Thus, the further
study is needed in the future.
We conclude that targeting PDK1 by DAP inhibited
cell proliferation and induced apoptosis induction in AML
cells. We also showed that DAP suppressed the expression
of the anti-apoptotic proteins and autophagy regulators and
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated
that PDK1 interacted with ULK1, BCL-xL and E3 ligase
CBL-b in AML cells, and DPA treatment could inhibit the
interactions (see Figure 7).

The DAP-treated cells (1× 105 cells/ml) were stained
with Annexin V-FITC using an Annexin V/Dead Cell
Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen, USA). The cells were washed
twice in cold PBS and resuspended in binding buffer. This
suspension (100 µl) was stained with 5 µl of Annexin
V-FITC, gently vortexed, and incubated in the dark for
15 min at room temperature. Finally, 10 µl of PI was
added, and the mixture was incubated in the dark for five
min at room temperature. After the addition of 400 µl of
binding buffer to each tube, the cells were analyzed using
Cytomics FC500 Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Detection of autophagy

Cell culture and chemicals

The cells were pelleted, and 1 ml of PBS was added.
Then, 50 µl of acridine orange (100 µg/ml) was added
and mixed in the dark for 15 min. [28] Autophagy was
analyzed by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC500 Flow
Cytometer, Beckman Coulter).

BCL-2- and Akt-overexpressing human myeloid
leukemia U937 cell lines were maintained in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS, Hyclone, Logan, UT). 2, 2-dichloroacetophenone
(DAP) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Stock
solutions of the drug (1 mM and 1 M) were prepared in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), stored as small aliquots at
-20°C and diluted as needed in cell culture medium.

Western blot analyses
Cellular lysates were prepared by suspending 1
x 106 cells in 100 µl of RIPA lysis buffer (1 x PBS, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS)
that was supplemented with freshly added 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10
mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The
cells were extracted on ice for 30 min. The proteins were
electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore
Corp., Bedford, MA), and detection of the specific
proteins was performed using chemiluminescence. All
of the antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology Corporation, Boston, USA.

Cell counting Kit-8 assay
The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to
determine cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Briefly,
10000 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates and treated
with various concentrations of DAP. The cells were
then grown for an additional 24, 48, and 72 h, and the
Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used according to the
manufacturer’s recommended instructions (Dojindo,
Japan). The effect on cell viability was assessed as the
percent cell viability compared to the un-treated control
group, which were arbitrarily assigned 100% viability at
24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. IC50 was calculated by
Graphpad Prism 5.0.

Co-IP analysis
The cells were lysed using IP lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and
1% NP-40). One mg of protein, 5 µg of antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, USA) and 30 µl of protein A/G
agarose beads (Santa Cruz, USA) were added to a 1.5-ml
Eppendorf tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight on
a rotator at 4°C. The beads were washed and centrifuged,
and the supernatant was discarded. Next, 20 µl of 5x
loading buffer was added, and the beads were heated for
five min at 100°C. Immunoreactive proteins were detected
using Western blotting.

Soft agarose cloning assay
Low-melting agarose was dissolved in pure water
at 1.2 and 0.7%, sterilized using an autoclave, and then
warmed at 42°C in a water bath. One ml of 2x RPMI 1640
was transferred to each well of a 6-well plate, and 1 ml of
1.2% agarose was then added. After these two solutions
were mixed, 500 µl of 0.7% agarose and 500 µl of RPMI
1640 containing 500 cells were pipetted into each well.
Two weeks later, the number of colonies was counted.

REFERENCES

Female nude mice (4-5 weeks old and weighing
17-23 g) were housed and cared at the animal facility of
the Laboratory Animals Centre of Sun Yat-sen University
under temperature 22°C and 12 hr light/dark cycle with
free access to food and water. All animal maintenance
and procedures were carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations established by the Animal Care and
Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-sen University as well as
the guidelines by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The
protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Ethics
Committee of Sun Yat-sen University.In animal study, all
efforts were made to minimize suffering ofmice. All mice
were humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation before death.
U937 cells (5x106) were injected subcutaneously into the
nude mice. The mice were randomly assigned into two
groups: each mouse in the treatment group was injected
with 10 mg per kg DAP each day; and an equal volume
of PBS solution was injected into the control group
(intraperitoneal injection). The length (L) and width (W)
of each tumor was measured with calipers, and the volume
(V) was calculated as follows: V = (L x W2) x 0.5. The
volumns of tumors and the weights of mice were measured
and calculated for 12 days after treatment. The tumor
xenograft weights were measured and deducted from the
body weights of mice.
