ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence suggests that Nanog is involved in cervical tumorigenesis.
However, the regulating role of Nanog in tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity are still
poorly understood. In this study, Nanog was disrupted by transcription activatorlike effector nucleases (TALEN) in Hela cells and its expression was significantly
decreased in a single-cell derived sub-clone with biallelic mutations. The disruption
of Nanog not only induced down regulation of some other core transcription factor
genes for cell self-renewal, such as Oct4, Sox2 and FoxD3, but also led to the down
regulation of some mesenchymal representative genes, vimentin and N-adherin,
and up regulation of the epithelial gene, E-cadherin. In addition, the invasiveness
and clonogenicity of the Hela cells were obviously affected, and surprisingly their
sensitivities to anti-cancer drugs were also significantly increased in vitro. After
Xenograft into nude mice, the growth volumes of the neoplasms from the Nanog
disrupted Hela cells were significantly smaller compared with those from wild type
ones. In conclusion, these results suggest that disruption of Nanog may reverse the
status of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is critical in tumorigenesis, and
alleviate chemoresistance, as well as their invasiveness, in cervical cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

stem cells [4, 5]. It has been reported that abnormal
expression of Nanog is associated with human germ cells
and several other types of cancers, such as gliomas [6],
embryonic carcinomas [7], prostate cancers [8], breast
cancers [9], etc. Down regulation of Nanog inhibits the
proliferation, colony expansion and clonogenic growth
of tumor cells [10], while over expression of Nanog may
induce chemoresistance in breast cancer and prostatic
cancers [11]. However, the correlation between Nanog
expression and the cervical cancer remains unclear and
the molecular mechanisms of Nanog in inducing EMT,
metastasis and chemoresistance also need to be further
clarified.
Since their discoveries, various kinds of RNAi
techniques have been widely used to repress some
gene expression in vitro because of their convenience
in use. However, none of these techniques are able to
induce complete disfunction of the target gene. The

The cervical cancers are the third most common
cancers in females, with their mortality in the fourth place
[1]. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is believed to play the
major role in the etiology of these cancers, though some
other factors may also be involved [2]. Poor prognosis
is usually associated with the characteristics of highly
invasive and diffusely metastatic [3]. In the initial stage
of invasion and metastasis, the morphogenetic changes
due to conversion of polarized epithelial cells to motile
mesenchymal cells, are referred as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). However, how cervical cancer cells
acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues and
metastasize is far from understood and little is known
about the reversal of EMT in these tumors.

recently developed genome-editing techniques, such as
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN),
could overcome this problem [12]. TALEN could induce
some mutations at random to a specific gene, which often
lead to translational termination and loss of its function
[13]. In the present study, Nanog of Hela cells was
biallelicly disrupted by TALEN in order to investigate
if it plays any role in affecting invasiveness, EMT and
chemoresistance in human cervical cancers.

cell cultures (Figure 1). As a matter of fact, this biallelic
Nanog disrupted Hela cell clone was not true Nanog
knockouts due to the polyploidy nature of Hela cells [14,
15]. Obviously, there are at least three Nanog alleles in
the selected Hela cell clone based on the gene sequencing
results. Nevertheless, they were used for the following
experiments.

Nanog disruption alleviated the invasiveness of
the Hela cells

RELSULTS

Transwell cell migration assay and scratch assay
were carried out to investigate how the invasiveness of
Hela cells was affected by Nanog disruption. As shown in
Figure 2, the numbers of the cells that passed through the
matrigel and transwell at 24h and 48h were 19±3 and 42±5
respectively for Nanog disrupted Hela cells, and 58±7 and
106±13 respectively for those with wild type Nanog. The
numbers for Nanog disrupted Hela cells were remarkably
less (P<0.05). In scratch assay, the migration rates for the
Nanog disrupted Hela cells at 24h and 48h were 20±4%
and 31±4% respectively while those for wild type Nanog
Hela cells were 29±4% and 51±7% respectively (P<0.05,
Figure 3).

T7E1 analysis and selection for cell clones with
biallelic mutations
To assess the endonuclease-dependent genome
editing activities, gDNA were prepared from the
transfected Hela cells after two rounds of transfection by
TALEN. The target region of Nanog gene was amplified
by PCR, and then digested by T7E1 enzyme. In result,
TALEN induced Nanog mutations were found to be more
than 50% and one cell clone was selected as with biallelic
Nanog mutations by gene sequencing from 30 single-

Nanog disruption decreased the cloning efficiency
of the Hela cells

sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel as shown in Figure
5A,B. The expression of MDR1, which is regarded as an
important indicator for drug resistance in chemotherapy,
was also significantly down regulated in the Nanog
disrupted Hela cells (P<0.05).

In cell colony formation assay as shown in Figure
4, the colony numbers formed by Nanog disrupted Hela
cells were 133±15, while those formed by wild type
Nanog Hela cells were 285±32. This significant difference
(P<0.05) indicated that the clonogenicity of Hela cells was
greatly inhibited by Nanog disruption.

Nanog disruption reversed the status of EMT
EMT is usually regarded as a progression sign
toward malignancy. However, this progress seemed to
be reversed by Nanog disruption. Apart from Nanog,
several other genes, like Oct4, Sox2 and FoxD3, were
also remarkably down regulated in real-time PCR,
though the expressions of c-Myc, Lin28, Klf4 and
Rex1 remained unchanged (Figure 6A,B). Meanwhile,
E-cadherin expression increased while that of vimentin
and N-Cadherin decreased in Western blots (Figure 6C).
All these changes suggested a reversal of EMT.

Nanog disruption increased the chemosensitivity
of the Hela cells
To evaluate the effect of Nanog disruption on
chemosensitivity of Hela cells, both wild type and
Nanog disrupted Hela cells were exposed to cisplatin or
paclitaxel. In result, Nanog disrupted Hela cells were more

cells. Control stands for the Hela cells of wild type; Nanog- stands for those with Nanog disruption.

The Nanog disrupted Hela cells grew slower in the
Xenograft test

by the chemoresistance of cancer cells through different
signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) [20, 21]. Studies have
shown that the failure of chemotherapy in many malignant
tumors was partially associated with abnormal expression
of MDR1 gene, which encodes the P-glycoprotein to pump
anticancer agents out of the cells [22, 23]. Surprisingly
in this study, MDR1, the most important indicator for
chemoresistance in chemotherapy, was down regulated
by Nanog disruption, though the mechanism underlined
remained unclear. And these Hela cells did show more
chemosensitivity when exposed to either cisplatin or
paclitaxel.
In conclusion, our data suggested that the disruption
of Nanog could reverse the status of EMT, which resulted
in alleviation of invasiveness and poor clonogenicity
in Hela cells, and that MDR1, an indicator gene for
chemoresistance, could somehow be down regulated
by even partial Nanog disruption, though it is usually
thought to be regulated through other singling pathways,
and this down regulation of MDR1 did result in less
chemoresistance.

Both Nanog disrupted and wild type Hela cells were
separately injected subcutaneously into nude mice and
the sizes of neoplasms formed from implanted Hela cells
were measured weekly. In result, the size of the neoplasms
formed from Nanog disrupted Hela cells was significantly
smaller than those from the wild type ones (P<0.05).
Furthermore, the mice implanted with Nanog disrupted
Hela cells lived longer than those with wild type ones (6-8
weeks vs. 4-5 weeks) (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
The development of a malignant tumor is a
complex process of multiple factors and stages, involving
malfunctions or mutations of a variety of genes. The
EMT is believed to be one of the most critical steps for
neoplasms to progress toward malignancy. It endows
tumor cells with migratory and invasive properties [16].
Understanding the molecular mechanism underlines
EMT and finding a way to stop or reverse it should be
very important for developing new therapeutic strategies
against various cancers.
In this study, Nanog was disrupted by TALEN
and that seemed to result in a dramatic reversal of EMT
process in Hela cells. Not only the expression of Nanog
was remarkably inhibited, but also the expressions of some
other core transcription factor genes for cell self-renewal,
such as Oct4, Sox2 and FoxD3, were down regulated.
E-cadherin mediates epithelial cell-to-cell adhesion [17].
The decrease of E-cadherin expression is a critical step
in the process of EMT [18], and it is often companied
with increase of N-cadherin expression. Vimentin is one
of the major mesenchymal intermediate filaments and its
expression represents the completely dedifferentiated state
in tumor cells that are highly proliferative and invasive
[19]. Remarkably, the E-cadherin expression increased
while the expressions of N-cadherin and vimentin
decreased after disruption of Nanog. These data suggest
Nanog may play a critical role in the process of EMT.
The grade of malignancy is closely related with
the invasiveness and the clonogenicity of a tumor. Both
transwell cell migration assay and scratch assay showed
that the invasiveness of the Nanog disrupted Hela cells
was significantly alleviated. Also, the clonogenicity
of Hela cells was obviously affected in the cell colony
formation assay. These findings suggested that the Nanog
disrupted Hela cells become less malignant, which is very
well in line with the phenomenon described above as a
reversal of EMT process.
Chemotherapy has been widely used in the
treatment of a variety of cancers including cervical
cancers. However, the benefits are frequently limited

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
The Hela cells transfected with a firefly luciferase
gene (also named as Hela-luc cells) was a generous gift
from Dr. Wang (University of British Columbia), were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

and

cell

The paired Nanog TALEN arms were designed
according to the manufacture’s instruction (Figure
1A). TALEN plasmids were constructed by one-step
ligation using the Fast TALETM TALEN Assembly Kit
(SIDANSAI).
About 10 μg of paired Nanog TALEN plasmids
(each 5ug) were mixed with 1×106 Hela cells in the cuvette
with 100μl Opti-MEM. The transfection was carried out
under 130 V by NEPA21 (Japan). The transfected cells
were transferred into one well of 6-well plate and cultured
at 37˚C against puromycin at 3μg/ml. After 3 days, the
cells were refreshed with the medium free of puromycin
and kept at 37˚C for few more days before harvested for
DNA extraction and single-cell culture in order to select
the Nanog disrupted cell clones.

Hela cells with Nanog disruption and those without were
digested and re-suspended with DMEM medium to 1×105
cells/ml. 200µl cell suspension were seeded into an upper
chamber of the polycarbonate membrane filter inserts with
8-µm pores (Corning, USA), which were pre-coated with
matrigel. The lower chamber was filled with 500 µl of
DMEM medium with 10% FBS. The cells (not migrated)
in the upper chamber surface were removed with cotton
swabs after incubated at 37˚C for 24 and 48 h, and the
cells (migrated) on the bottom side of the membrane
were fixed with 95% ethanol for 30 min, stained with the
0.1% crystal violet and counted under a microscope. The
experiment was performed in triplicates.

Genomic DNA was prepared from both the Nanog
disrupted and wild type Hela cells with Blood Genomic
DNA Extraction Mini Kit (TIANGEN). The genomic
region encompassing the TALEN target site was amplified
by PCR and its products were denatured and annealed to
form heteroduplex DNA. The annealed DNA was treated
with 5 units of T7E1 (Viewsolid Biotech) at 37˚C for
15 min and then ran an agarose gel to separate the DNA
fragments. The TALEN target rate was calculated on the
intensities of DNA bands, which were proportionally
measured by grey scale technique.

Chemosensitivity assay

Scratch assay

The chemosensitivities of the Hela cells with/
without Nanog disruption were compared by the cell
viabilities after exposed to cisplatin or paclitaxel. Briefly,
after washed with PBS, freshly disassociated cells
were seeded into a 96-well plate (1×104 cells/well) and
incubated at 37˚C for 24h. Refreshed the cells with the
growth media containing 1 µg/ml cisplatin or 40 ng/ml
cisplatin and continually incubated for 48 more hours,
took the cells out of the incubator, added 1ul luciferase
substrate to the medium and left them at RM for10-15
min, then checked cell viabilities with a florescent imaging
system (IVIS ® Spectrum, caliper). The experiment was
performed in duplicates and repeated three times.

The scratch assay [2] was used to observe the cell
migration. The Hela cells with/without Nanog disruption
were cultured to completely confluent in 6-well plates and
a scratch was made across the cell monolayer of each well
with a 10µl pipette tip. Then washed the cell monolayer
3 times with D-PBS and incubated in serum free DMEM
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48h. The widths of the scratch
were measured and the percentages of narrow down were
compared at 0h, 24h and 48h respectively. The experiment
was performed in triplicates.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration assays were carried out with
transwell filters as described by Liu et al [2]. Both the

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The clonogenicity was analyzed by colonyformation tests. The Hela cells with/without Nanog
disruption were plated into 6 wells at 1000 cells/well
in a 12-well plate pre-coated with 1% gelatin. The cells
were incubated at 37˚C for 10 to 12 days, until the cell
colonies grew large enough to be visualized. Then the
colonies were counted with the same imaging system
as the chemosensivity assay used. The experiment was
performed in triplicates.

Results were presented as means of three
independent experiments (M±SD). Statistical analyses
were performed with the Student’s t-test by using SPSS
13.0. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
