ABSTRACT
Glioblastomas are progressive brain tumors with devastating proliferative
and invasive characteristics. Ion channels are the second largest target class for
drug development. In this study, we investigated the effects of the TRPM7 inhibitor
carvacrol on the viability, resistance to apoptosis, migration, and invasiveness of the
human U87 glioblastoma cell line.
The expression levels of TRPM7 mRNA and protein in U87 cells were detected by
RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. TRPM7 currents were recorded
using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. An MTT assay was used to assess cell
viability and proliferation. Wound healing and transwell experiments were used to
evaluate cell migration and invasion. Protein levels of p-Akt/t-Akt, p-ERK1/2/tERK1/2, cleaved caspase-3, MMP-2 and phosphorylated cofilin were also detected.
TRPM7 mRNA and protein expression in U87 cells is higher than in normal
human astrocytes. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that carvacrol blocks
recombinant TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells and endogenous TRPM7-like current
in U87 cells. Carvacrol treatment reduced the viability, migration and invasion of
U87 cells. Carvacrol also decreased MMP-2 protein expression and promoted the
phosphorylation of cofilin. Furthermore, carvacrol inhibited the Ras/MEK/MAPK and
PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
Therefore, carvacrol may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of
glioblastomas through its inhibition of TRPM7 channels.

INTRODUCTION

to the rapid proliferation and unrestricted migration of
glioblastomas [1]. The potent ability of glioblastomas
to migrate throughout brain tissue via the degradation of
extracellular matrix is the main reason that surgery fails
to completely remove glioblastomas from the brain [2].
Thus, the current standard treatment for GBM involves
maximal surgical resection, followed by radiation and
adjuvant chemotherapy using temozolomide [3]. Since,
the effectiveness of GBM therapies is limited [4], the

GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) is a common
primary brain tumor with aggressive proliferative
and invasive characteristics; it has a 5-year survival
rate of 9.8% in adults that undergo a combination
of chemotherapy and radiotherapy [1]. The median
overall survival is only 14.6 months after surgical
resection, chemotherapy and radiation, which is due

discovery of new and specific chemotherapeutic agents is
welcomed.
Genetic abnormalities that enhance receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated constitutive activation
of Ras/MEK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways
have been identified in human glioblastomas [5, 6]. It is
for this reason that novel compounds targeting receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) receptors, the PI3k/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway are currently
being evaluated in clinical trials [7].
The TRPM7 channel is a member of the melastatin
subfamily within the transient receptor potential (TRP)
ion channel superfamily.It is a divalent cation channel
that conducts calcium, and it is ubiquitously expressed
in almost all tissues. TRPM7 plays important role in
anoxia/ischemia, development and cell proliferation [810]. Studies also show that ion channels are involved in
the differentiation, proliferation, and invasion of tumors
[11]. The specific involvement of TRPM7 has been
demonstrated in the tumor cells of several cancer types,
including breast cancer [12], gastric cancer, head and neck
cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer,
prostate cancer, retinoblastoma and leukemia [13-17]. The
role of TRPM7 in cancers is suggested by its up-regulation
in the tissues of several cancer types [16, 18]. Therefore,
TRPM7 can potentially serve as both a clinical biomarker
and therapeutic target in a variety of cancers [19].
Several inhibitors of TRPM7 have been
identified, including carvacrol [20], Waixenicin A [21],
2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) [22], sphingosine
and FTY720 [23]. Carvacrol is a naturally synthesized,
bioactive monoterpenoid phenol with multiple uses. Its
synthesis originates from the mevalonate pathway [24]
and constitutes various proportions of oregano essential
oils from numerous genera [25]. It’s oral LD50 is 810
mg/kg in rats [26] and it is a “generally recognized as
safe” food flavor additive according to the United States
Food and Drug Administration. Carvacrol exhibits
bioactivity in a variety of areas. It has antimicrobial,
antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiprotozoal
properties thus suggesting its usefulness as an inhibitor
of foodborne pathogens and human pathogenic bacteria
[27]. In the physiological system, carvacrol exhibits
anti-inflammatory,
antidiabetic,
antinociceptive,
cardioprotective, neuroprotective and anticarcinogenic
properties [27]. The effects of carvacrol on glioblastoma
cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis remain
unclear.
This study evaluated the anti-glioblastoma
effects of the TRPM7 inhibitor carvacrol on U87 cells
and investigated the potential mechanisms underlying
these effects. Wound healing and transwell assays, in
combination with RT-PCR, western blotting and patchclamp recordings were used to study the effects of
carvacrol.

TRPM7 mRNA and protein expression is greater
in U87 cells compared to NHA cells
To examine the levels of TRPM7 mRNA and protein
in U87 cells, RT-PCR and western blotting were carried
out, respectively. The NHA cell line was used as a control.
Figure 1A shows that the amount of TRPM7 mRNA in
U87 cells (normalized to GAPDH: 0.98±0.7 arbitrary unit,
n=6) was significantly higher than in NHA cells (0.78±0.2,
n=6. p<0.05). Western blotting demonstrated that TRPM7
protein level (normalized to β-actin) was also higher in
U87 cells (1.99±0.31 arbitrary unit, n=3) compared to
NHA cells (0.20±0.12, n = 3. p<0.05) (Figure 1B). TRPM7
protein levels were further measured in U87 cells using
immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Figure 1C, a
higher level of TRPM7 protein was observed in U87 cells
compared to NHA cells in cell culture. The fluorescence
intensity in U87 cells was 25% higher than NHA cells
(p<0.05, n=3). Our results provide the first evidence that
TRPM7 channels are highly expressed in U87 cells.

Carvacrol inhibits TRPM7 and TRPM7-like
currents in U87 cells
To confirm the blocking effect of carvacrol on
TRPM7 current, we first carried out whole-cell patchclamp recording on HEK293 cells overexpressing
recombinant TRPM7 channels. Tetracycline was used to
induce TRPM7 overexpression in HEK293 cells. Figure
2A and 2B show that the TRPM7 currents in HEK293 cells
treated by tetracycline were large and outwardly rectifying,
whereas those in cells without tetracycline incubation
were smaller and outwardly rectifying. Carvacrol (300
μM) significantly reduced TRPM7 current intensity at +90
mV in HEK293 cells treated with tetracycline, reducing
TRPM7 current density by approximately 56% (Figure
2A, n = 8, p<0.05). Carvacrol did not reduce TRPM7
current intensity at +90 mV in HEK293 cells without
tetracycline treatment (Figure 2A, n=6). We next tested
whether carvacrol reduced TRPM7-like currents in U87
cells. As shown in Figure 2C, the intensity of outwardly
rectifying current in U87 cells recorded at a current
density of 100 mV was 9.0±1.0 pA/pF. Carvacrol (500μM)
perfusion significantly reduced the outward current to
4.6±1.2 pA/pF (p<0.05, n=3 cells). Inward current was
similarly reduced by carvacrol (p<0.05, n=3 cells). After
washout of carvacrol, the inhibitory effects of carvacrol
were eliminated. Our results suggest that TRPM7 channels
are functional in U87 cells and channel activity is sensitive
to carvacrol block.

U87 cells was measured by western blotting from three different passages. After normalized to β-actin, the results showed that TRPM7

Carvacrol reduces U87 cell viability and
proliferation

at the same time-points: 28.5±1.7%, 45.2±1.1% and
77.7±2.2% (p<0.05, n=4), respectively. This indicated
that the migration of U87 cells in the carvacrol group was
significantly reduced compared to the control group. In
Figure 4C and 4D, transwell assay results indicated that
carvacrol (500 μM) treatment significantly inhibited U87
cell invasion (75±4 invading cells in the carvacrol group
versus 101±2 invading cells in the control group, p<0.05,
n=3).

After verifying that carvacrol reduced TRPM7-like
current activity in U87 cells, we investigated the effects of
carvacrol on viability and proliferation of U87 cells using
an MTT assay. Figure 3A shows that carvacrol treatment
for 24 hours reduced the viability of U87 cells in a dosedependent manner, with an IC50 of 561.3±22.2μM. The
time course of cell proliferation is shown in Figure 3B.
The proliferation of cells in the control group increased
with time in culture (119.9±2.0%, 196.1±5.4% and
250.1±2.7% at 24, 48 and 72 hours). Compared with
control (0.1% DMSO in culture medium), 125 μM
carvacrol did not affect the proliferation of U87 cells
(p>0.05, n=8). After treatment with 250 μM carvacrol, cell
proliferation increased to 112.0±1.7%, 180.5±3.5% and
222.3±7.1% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. This is
significantly lower than the proliferation of control cells at
48 and 72 hours (p<0.05, n=8). Carvacrol (500-1000μM)
significantly inhibited proliferation of U87 cells at 24, 48
and 72 hours (Figure 3B, data presented as the mean±
SEM, p<0.05, n=8 experiments).

Carvacrol reduces MMP-2 protein expression
The inhibition of MMP-2 activity or downregulation
of MMP-2 protein levels inhibits migration and invasion
of glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo [3, 4, 7].
To determine whether carvacrol exerts its effects via an
MMP-2-dependent mechanism, we measured the protein
level of MMP-2. Western blotting analysis showed that
carvacrol (500 and 750 μM) treatment for 24 hours
reduced MMP-2 protein level in U87 cells Figure 4E
(86.8±8.5% in the 500 μM carvacrol group, 24.5±3.7%
in the 750 μM carvacrol group, versus 111.1±9.6% in the
control group, n=6, p<0.05).

Carvacrol upregulates phosphorylation of cofilin
(p-cofilin) and reduces polymerization of F-actin

Carvacrol induces apoptosis in U87 cells
We next addressed whether carvacrol reduces the
viability of U87 cells by enhancing apoptosis. We first
measured apoptotic nuclear condensation using DAPI
staining. Figure 3C shows induced apoptotic nuclear
condensation after treatment with carvacrol (750 μM)
for 24 hours (Figure 3C). We then measured the level of
cleaved caspase-3, an active form of apoptosis-related
cysteine peptidase using western blotting analysis. As
shown in Figure 3D, carvacrol (500 and 750 μM) treatment
for 24 hours enhanced cleaved caspase-3 levels in a dosedependent manner. Cleaved caspase-3 levels were about 9
times higher in the 500 μM carvacrol group and 48 times
higher in the 750 μM carvacrol group compared to the
control group (Figure 3D, p<0.05, n=6).

Cofilin is an actin-binding protein and depolymerizes
actin filaments [29]. It is inactivated by phosphorylation
[30]. We wondered whether the effects of carvacrol were
mediated through regulation of cofilin. In Figure 5A-5D,
western blotting analysis showed that carvacrol (500 μM)
treatment for 24 hours increased the level of p-cofilin,
while the total cofilin (t-cofilin) did not change. The ratio
of p-cofilin/t-cofilin was significantly higher in carvacroltreated cultures (500 μM, 0.42±0.05, n = 6) than in control
cultures (0.29±0.02, n=6; p<0.05, Figure 5B). Moreover,
we evaluated the effects of carvacrol on the regulation
of the actin cytoskeleton in U87 cells. In Figure 5E and
F, rhodamine phalloidin staining shows that cells in the
control group are rich in bright actin clusters (indicated
by arrow), while cells treated with carvacrol- for 24 hours
have fewer of these clusters (Figure 5G).

Carvacrol reduces U87 cell migration and
invasion

Carvacrol suppresses PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK
signaling pathways

A wound healing assay and transwell assay were
carried out to evaluate whether carvacrol alters the cell
migration and invasion properties of U87 cells. Wound
healing assays are used for analysis of cell migration
in vitro [28]. In Figure 4A and 4B, cell culture images
were captured at 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours after carvacrol
(500 μM) treatment and the wound gap was analyzed. At
6, 12 and 24 hours, wound closure in the control group
was 38.8±0.3%, 59.7±2.0% and 97.9±0.6%, which
was faster than wound closure in the carvacrol group

PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways are
involved in the regulation of proliferation, migration and
invasion of glioblastoma cells. As shown in Figure 6A,
both p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 protein levels were reduced in
carvacrol-treated (500 μM) cells. Densitometry analysis
shows that p-Akt levels, when normalized to GAPDH
levels, are significantly reduced in the carvacrol group

group (0.19±0.01). Carvacrol treatment for 24 hours did
not significantly affect total Akt (t-Akt) protein expression
in U87 cells (Figure 6C, p>0.05, n=6). In addition, the
ratio of p-Akt/t-Akt in the carvacrol group was smaller
than in the control group (Figure 6D, carvacrol (250

A172 cells- a human glioma cell line [31]. In this study,
we observed the effects of silencing TRPM7 on these
functions in U87 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, TRPM7
siRNA significantly decreased TRPM7 protein by ~70%
(p<0.05, n=4). We further employed whole-cell patchclamp recording to measure TRPM7-like current in U87
cells. TRPM7 siRNA transfection of 72 hours significantly
reduced TRPM7-like current in U87 cells (Figure 7B
and 7C, p<0.05, n=5 cells in NC group and 9 cells in
siRNA group). These data suggests that TRPM7 siRNA
can effectively silence TRPM7 by reducing protein
expression and ion channel activity. As shown in Figure
7D, silencing TRPM7 significantly reduced cell viability
(67.0±2.8% of NC, p<0.05, n=5). Moreover, silencing
TRPM7 significantly inhibited U87 cell migration (Figure
7E and 7F, siRNA: 77.9±1.3% versus NC: 95.9±1.1%
wound closure, p<0.05, n=3) and invasion (Figure 7G, S2:
62.5±4.0% of NC, p<0.05, n=3).

Tumorigenesis is a product of the imbalance
between cell proliferation and apoptosis. However,
the process of tumor growth is complicated and does
not simply result from enhanced cell proliferation and/
or reduced apoptosis. The fact that significant cell
death occurs in tumors explains why the amount of cell
proliferation does not always correlate with tumor growth
rate [32]. Standard care for glioblastomas includes surgery,
chemotherapy (temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating
agent) and radiation therapy [33]. However, malignant
glioma cells have intense resistance to death-inducing
stimuli such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Thus, it is
clinically important to discover novel therapeutic targets
for the treatment of glioblastomas.
Recent studies have focused on the TRPM7 pathway
in glioma cells and stem-like cells derived from human
glioma cell lines [34]. Consistent with previous reports
[16, 18], we found high mRNA and protein levels of
TRPM7 in human U87 cells (Figure 1). Liu et al reported
that TRPM7 promotes the proliferation, migration, and
invasion of A172 cells, a glioma cell line [34]. TRPM7
activates JAK2/STAT3 and/or Notch signaling pathways
and leads to increased cell proliferation and migration [34].
Activation of STAT3 by TRPM7 also directly regulates
expression levels of ALDH1. The Notch signaling pathway
has potential as a therapeutic target since it plays important
roles in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cancer
stem cell regulation. STAT3 is a tumor suppressor in
PTEN-deficient glioblastoma tumors but has a promoting
function in EGFRvIII-expressing tumors [35]. Apart
from being a stem cell marker in human glioblastoma,
ALDH1 may also have functional roles related to selfprotection, differentiation, expansion, and proliferation
[36, 37]. TRPM7 suppression by shRNAi inhibits the
growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion of A172
cells [31]. Thus, TRPM7 appears to be a promising target
for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma. In this study,
we investigated whether blocking TRPM7 activity using a
pharmacological approach mimics the effects of TRPM7
suppression.
Carvacrol blocks TRPM7 channels with an IC50
of 307 μM in HEK cells over-expressing TRPM7 [20].
We have verified that carvacrol (500 µM) blocks both
recombinant TRPM7 and endogenous TRPM7-like
currents in U87 cells (Figure 2). Human glioblastoma
cell line A172 is very similar to the human U87 cell line
used in this study - both of which are human malignant
astrocytoma cell lines [38]. We found that blocking
TRPM7 channelswith carvacrol reduced viability,
proliferation, migration and invasion of U87 cells. These
results were further confirmed by silencing TRPM7, which
was shown to reduce cell viability, migration and invasion.
The effects of TRPM7 silencing on U87 cells is consistent
with a previous report [31]. The IC50 of carvacrol for
the reduction of cell viability and proliferation of U87
cells was 561.3 µM in our study. A lower carvacrol

We examined p-Akt/t-Akt, p-ERK1/2/t-ERK1/2
and MMP-2 protein expression in U87 cells after
silencing TRPM7. As show in Figure 8, silencing TRPM7
significantly reduces p-Akt (Figure 8B, 62.6±5.4% of NC,
p<0.05, n=4) and p-ERK1/2 (Figure 8E, 64.8±6.9% of
NC, p<0.05, n=4) protein levels, as well as the ratio of
p-Akt/t-Akt (Figure 8D, 55.5±6.2% of NC, p<0.05, n=4)
and p-ERK1/2/t-ERK1/2 (Figure 8G, 69.1±7.9% of NC,
p<0.05, n=4) while it did not significantly affect t-Akt and
t-ERK1/2 protein expression (Figure 8C and 8F, p>0.05,
n=4). Moreover, silencing TRPM7 reduced MMP-2
protein expression (Figure 8H, 60.4±9.6% of NC, p<0.05,
n=4).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that TRPM7 was
upregulated in U87 cells. Carvacrol treatment reduced
cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of
U87 cells, and induced apoptosis by blocking TRPM7.
Moreover, we showed that carvacrol decreased matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) protein levels and increased
levels of phosphorylated cofilin in U87 cells, which may
be the underlying mechanism of the inhibitory effects of
carvacrol on U87 cell migration and invasion. Carvacrol
treatment also inhibited PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK
signaling pathways. In the parallel experiments, silencing
TRPM7 elicited effects on U87 cellsconsistent with those
of carvacrol , including the inhibition of cell viability,
migration and invasion, the attenuation of PI3K/Akt and
MEK/MAPK signaling pathways, and the reduction of
MMP-2 protein expression.

concentration has been reported to exert antiproliferative
effects in leiomyosarcoma cells [39]. A previous study
reported that carvacrol treatment at concentrations below
200 mg/L (1.33 mM) for 24 hours did not affect the
viability of healthy neurons and N2a cancer cells [40]. The
concentrations of carvacrol used in our study are below
this concentration. Carvacrol also has non-specific channel
targets such as the activation of TRPV3 and TRPA1
channels [41], and the inhibition of TRPL channels at a
similar concentration [20]. To date however, there is no
evidence illustrating the involvement of TRPV3 or TRPA1
in the regulation of glioma cell function. Considering
that ion channels are the second largest target for drug

development, it is important to study TRPM7 channels for
drug development and translational research.
Carvacrol has been shown to provide protection
against apoptosis in ischemia-reperfusion injury [42],
acute myocardial infarction [43], thioacetamide-induced
hepatotoxicity [44], and H2O2 induced injury in isolated
pancreas islet cells [45]. However, carvacrol exhibits proapoptotic effects in multiple cancer cell lines, including
DBTRG-05MG human glioblastoma cells [46], a breast
cancer cell line [47] and a human hepatocellular carcinoma
cell line HepG-2 [48], via either ROS generation [46] or
mitochondrially mediated apoptosis [48]. In this study we
show that carvacrol triggers apoptosis-related processes

Figure 9: Schematic diagram of signaling mechanisms involved in the effects of carvacrol on proliferation, migration
and invasion of U87 cells. TRPM7 is constitutively active in resting cells. When exposed to various extracellular or cytosolic stress
or stimuli, TRPM7 regulates entry of Mg2+ and Ca2+. Moreover, TRPM7 has an α-type serine/threonine protein kinase domain that can
phosphorylate itself, as well as cytosolic substrates such as modulating phosphorylation of PLC and subsequently regulating PI3K/Akt
and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways, leading to functional gene transcription and translation. As a consequence, the TRPM7 channel
modulates cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. It indicates that carvacrol exerts its anti-glioblastoma effects by inhibiting TRPM7
and thus PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways.

in U87 cells, supporting the notion that the effects of
carvacrol are cell type-dependent.
Cell migration is a complex mechanism essential
for biological processes such as immune response, wound
healing, tissue repair and embryogenesis. Errors in cell
migration lead to a variety of pathologies, including cancer
invasion and metastasis [49, 50]. Cell migration is driven
by the formation of specific cytoskeletal structures known
as lamellipodia, filopodia and invadosomes, which initiate
the protrusion of the cell membrane [51]. Formation of
these structures is in turn highly dependent on the spatial
and temporal assembly and disassembly of actin filaments
at the protruding edge [52]. To date, several intracellular
pathways that regulate the formation of these structures
have been identified and the overexpression of the proteins
involved in these pathways has been shown in several types
of cancers. These include the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
protein (WASP) family (Apr2/3 complex, LIM kinase),
cofilin and cotractin pathways [53]. While all of these
pathways have been extensively studied in the context
of cancer cell migration and invasion, the LIM kinase –
cofilin pathway is considered to be essential in regulating
cancer cell motility [53]. Cofilin is highly overexpressed
in rat glioblastoma, human adenocarcinoma, breast cancer,
ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer cells [54-58]. The
amount of phosphorylated (inactive) cofilin is significantly
decreased in cell lines derived from Jurkat T-lymphoma,
kidney, liver, colon and cervical cancers [58]. In particular,
cofilin has been shown to be involved in the formation
of invadopodia [59] (the major structure involved in
cancer cell motility), and inhibiting confilin with siRNA
or overexpression of the LIM kinase active domain
reduces the invasion of carcinoma cells [60, 61]. Cofilin
acts through severing cross-linked actin filaments, thus
increasing the number of free-pointed and barbed ends,
as well as the number of actin monomers available for
polymerization and formation of invadopodial protrusions
[52]. In our study, carvacrol enhances p-cofilin levels
without affecting total cofilin levels, which subsequently
attenuates U87 cells migration and invasion. Invadosomes
were observed in F-actin-rich areas at the leading edge
of the cell membrane [62]. In accordance with our
findings, TRPM7 inhibition also causes a reduction in
invadosome formation in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells
[62]. Immunofluorescent images showed that untreated
cells possess actin-rich invadosomes that are visualized
by rhodamine phalloidin (Figure 5E). In contrast, cells
treated with 500 µM carvacrol exhibit longer, unsevered
actin filaments and fewer actin-rich hotspots at the leading
edge of the cells. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2)
is highly localized to the invadosomes of cancer cells,
causing degradation of the extracellular matrix and aiding
in the invasion process [63]. Carvacrol decreased MMP2
levels along with invadosome number - thus reducing the
ability of U87 cells to migrate and metastasize.
PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

considered to play a critical role in proliferation, migration
and invasion of glioblastoma cells. Inhibitors that target
these signaling pathways are currently under evaluation
in clinical trials [7]. However, majority of patients fail
to respond to treatments that suppress only one of these
signaling pathways [64] (likely due to cross-talk between
these pathways). Therefore, blocking both of these
signaling pathways simultaneously may be a rational and
more effective strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma
[65]. Several studies suggest that TRPM7 regulates
PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK pathways. Down-regulation
of TRPM7 decreases the level of p-Akt in OVCA cells
and human lung fibroblasts, and also decreases the level
of p-ERK1/2 in breast cancer cells [66-68]. Moreover,
silencing TRPM7 in hepatic stellate cells prevents an
increasing in p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 levels induced by
PDGF-BB [69]. In this study, we found that both carvacrol
and the silencing of TRPM7 reduced p-Akt and p-ERK1/2
protein levels, suggesting that blocking TRPM7 by
carvacrol inhibits PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling
pathways. The molecular mechanism by which TRPM7
interacts with these signaling pathways remains unclear.
PI3K/Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling are regulated by
phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) [70],
and several phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes also interact
with the TRPM7 α-type serine/threonine protein kinase
domain [71]. Hence, we speculate that TRPM7 likely
regulates PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling through an
interaction with PLC (A schematic diagram is shown in
Figure 7). However, further study is needed to determine
if this is indeed the case.
In conclusion, carvacrol reduced cell viability,
proliferation, migration and invasion in the human
glioblastoma U87 cell line, as well as induced apoptosis
- likely by inhibiting TRPM7 activity and both the PI3K/
Akt and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways. Carvacrol may
regulate U87 cell migration and invasion through the
reduction of MMP-2 protein expression and an increase
in p-cofilin levels. Our findings suggest that carvacrol has
therapeutic potential for the treatment of glioblastomas.

unless mentioned otherwise.

Western blotting experiments were performed as
previously described [72, 73]. Cells were scraped in RIPA
buffer plus proteinase inhibitor cocktail (50 mM Tris, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS,

temperature (RT) for 1 hour. Bands were developed with
a chemiluminescence reagent system (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences Inc., Boston, MA). Densitometry was carried out
using Image-Pro Plus software.

Cell culture
Human glioblastoma cell line U87 was received
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA) and normal human astrocytes (NHA, Clonetics, East
Rutherford, NJ) were plated on 10-cm culture dishes and
cultured in complete DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100
U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, USA) in 5%
CO2 and 95% humidified air atmosphere at 37ºC. HEK293 cells with stable expression of Flag-murine TRPM7/
pCDNA4 were cultured with MEM supplemented with
10% FBS, blasticidin (5 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, USA),
Glutamax-1 (2mM, Invitrogen, USA) and zeocin (0.4 mg/
mL, Invitrogen, USA). TRPM7 expression was induced
by adding 1 μg/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to
the culture.

Immunofluorescent staining
U87 and NHA cells (5×104 cells/mL) were
maintained on 18-mm round Poly-D-Lysine-coated
coverslips (Warner Instruments, USA) for 24 hours,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at RT,
and then permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C
with anti-TRPM7 (ab729, Abcam, 1:50) and β-tubulin
(mouse mAb, Invitrogen, USA, 1:500) antibodies in 2%
bovine serum albumin (BSA, Bioshop, Canada), 2% FBS
and 0.2% fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cells
were then incubated with Alexa-Fluor 488 conjugated
anti-mouse and Alexa-Fluor 405 conjugated anti-goat
(1:500, Molecular Probes, USA) antibodies for 2 hours
at RT. Fluorescence was visualized with an LSM700
Zeiss confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Gottingen,
Germany).

RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis and PCR
reactions were also carried out according to the
product directions. PCR amplifications were carried
out with the following primers: TRPM7 (F:5’CTTATGAAGAGGCAGGTCATGG-3’,
R:5’CATCTTGTCTGAAGGACTG-3’, product size is 214
bp). GAPDH (F: 5’-AATCCCATCACCATCTTCC-3’,
R: 5’-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAA-3’, product size
is 312 bp). PCR reaction conditions: denaturing at 94ºC
for 30 seconds, annealing at 50ºC for 30 seconds, and
polymerization at 72ºC for 5 min. PCR products were

viable (living) cells. Cells seeded on 96-well culture plates
at a density of 5×104 cells/mL were treated with various
concentrations of carvacrol (from 125 μM to 1000 μM)
for 24, 48 or 72 hours. MTT reagent (0.5 mg/ml MTT in
PBS) was diluted into completed medium (dilution ratio of
1:10) and added to each well. After incubating in a CO2
incubator for 3 hours, the medium was aspirated from
each well and 200 μL DMSO was added. The absorbance
was measured in a microplate reader (Syngery H1,
Biotek, USA) at 490 nm. Cell viability was expressed as a
percentage of the control (0.1% DMSO).

Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was used to study
TRPM7 currents from TRPM7-overexpressed HEK-293
cells and TRPM7-like currents from U87 cells using an
Axopatch 700B (Axon Instruments, Inc.) [9]. Currents
were recorded using a 400 ms voltage ramp protocol
(−100 to +100 mV) with an interval of 5s at 2 kHz and
digitized at 5 kHz. pClamp 9.2 software was used for
data acquisition and Clampfit 9.2 was used for data
analysis. All experiments were carried out at RT. Patch
pipette resistance was between 3-5 megaohms after filling
with pipette solution containing (in mM): 145 cesium
methanesulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH
adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The bath solution contained
(in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, and 10
glucose (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) [9]. When
recording the TRPM7-like currents in U87 cells, 500 nM
tetrodotoxin and 5 μM nimodipine was added to the bath
solution.

Apoptotic morphological changes assay
The apoptotic morphological change was examined
using DAPI staining as previously described [72, 73].
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes
at RT, then incubated with DAPI (1μg/mL) for 15 minutes.
At least 6 fields were randomly chosen and images were
captured using ZEISS AXIO fluorescence microscope
equipped with a 20× objective (Zeiss, Germany). Cells
with condensed chromatin or shrunken, irregular, or
fragmented nuclei were considered to be apoptotic.

Cell migration assay
Cell migration was measured using a wound healing
assay as described previously [74]. In brief, cells were
seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5×104 cells/mL and
grown to over 90% confluence. The monolayer of cells
was scratched with a 200 μL pipette tip to create a wound
gap, and treated with either carvacrol (500 μM) or vehicle
control (0.1% DMSO) at various time points. Cell images
were obtained with a digital camera connected to a phasecontrast Olympus microscope (CKX41, 10× objective).
The same visual field was used throughout the experiment.
The wound gap was measured by Image-Pro Plus
software with the wound healing tool. Wound closure was
calculated using the following formula: Wound closure
(%) = Gap(T-T0)/GapT0*100% (where T is the treatment
time and T0 is the time that the wound was induced).

Silencing experiments
Nonspecific control siRNA (NC) and 3 pairs
of siRNA for human TRPM7 (NM_017672) were
purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd
(China). The TRPM7 siRNA sequences were as follows:
sense 5’-GCAGGACCUUAUGUAAUGATT-3’ and
antisense 5’-UCAUUACAUAAGGUCCUGCTT-3’. The
nonspecific control siRNA sequences were as follows:
sense 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’ and
antisense
5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3’.
SiRNA transfection was performed following the
manufacturer’s instructions using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX Reagent (Life Technologies, USA) and
120 nM siRNA. Western blotting, MTT assay, wound
healing and invasion experiments were carried out after
transfection with siRNA for 72 hours.

Transwell assay to evaluate cell invasion
Transwell assay experiments were carried out
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BioCoat
Matrigel invasion chambers (8-μm polycarbonate
Nucleopore filters, Cat. 354480. BD BioSciences) were
used to examine U87 cell invasion. After treatment with
carvacrol (500 μM) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO)
for 24 hours, 100 μL of cells (2.5×104 cells/mL) in FBSfree DMEM were added to the top chamber. 600 μL of
complete medium was added in the bottom chamber
as a chemoattractant. Invading cells that degrade the

Cell viability and proliferation assay
Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay as
previously described [73]. When incubated with U87 cells
in culture medium, the ratio of yellow MTT to purple
formazan is reduced in the mitochondria of living cells.

cells were captured with a digital camera connected to an
Olympus microscope (CKX41). The number of invading
cells was counted using Image-Pro Plus software with the
cell counter tool.
