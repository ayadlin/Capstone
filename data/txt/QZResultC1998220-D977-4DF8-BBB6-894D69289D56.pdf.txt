BACKGROUND: Detailed information about how patients with head and neck carcinoma (HNC) are treated across practice settings
does not exist. The authors conducted a prospective, observational study to examine the patterns of care for a series of patients with
newly diagnosed HNC in the United States and to test 2 hypotheses: 1) There is no difference in the pattern of care between community and academic settings; and 2) the results of major randomized clinical trials will change the pattern of care in both practice settings within 1 year of publication in peer-reviewed journals. METHODS: Patients aged 18 years were enrolled in the Longitudinal
Oncology Registry of Head and Neck Carcinoma (LORHAN) after providing written informed consent if they had a confirmed diagnosis of new HNC and were scheduled to receive treatment other than surgery alone. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2010, 100 centers
enrolled 4243 patients, including 2612 patients (62%) from academic investigators and 1631 patients (38%) from community centers.
Initial treatments were radiation with concurrent chemotherapy (30%) or cetuximab (9%), adjuvant radiotherapy (21%), induction
chemotherapy (16%), and other (24%). Intensity modulated radiation therapy was the dominant radiation technique (84%). Singleagent cisplatin was prescribed in nearly half of patients and more often in academic centers (53% vs 43% of patients; P < .0001). Single-agent cetuximab was the next most common drug used (19%) and was prescribed more frequently in community settings (24%
vs 17%; P ¼ .0001). The data rejected the 2 prospective hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: LORHAN documented differences in patient
characteristics and treatments between community and academic settings for a large series of patients in the United States. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 49,000 new cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are diagnosed each year in the United States.1 Most
patients with HNC present with locally advanced disease,2 diminishing their chance for a cure. Several clinical trials3-7
and meta-analyses8,9 established that adding cisplatin concurrently to radiation improved the rates of locoregional control,
organ preservation, and/or survival for patients with HNC. Four recently reported randomized trials established new therapy options. Bonner et al reported on a trial of cetuximab plus radiation versus radiation alone in patients with locally
advanced HNC10 and demonstrated that adding cetuximab to radiation significantly improved locoregional control and
overall survival (OS) without increasing the grade 3 toxicities commonly associated with radiation, including mucositis.
Two phase 3 trials addressed induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) versus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) alone followed by radiation or chemoradiotherapy11,12 and demonstrated that TPF yielded significantly longer OS compared with PF alone. Rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were higher for the
TPF group in both studies, although treatment delays because of neutropenia, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, and fatigue

were more frequent in the PF group.11 Pointreau et al also
reported that TPF was significantly better than PF alone
in preserving the larynx at 3 years in patients with
advanced cancers of the larynx and hypopharynx who
required total laryngectomy.13 Patients in the TPF group
had more grade 4 or febrile neutropenia compared with
patients in the PF group, who had more grade 3/4 stomatitis and grade 4 creatinine elevation. It is unclear how
quickly and the extent to which these positive trials have
changed daily clinical practice and whether and how treatment strategies have varied by practice setting.
The Longitudinal Oncology Registry of Head and
Neck Carcinoma (LORHAN) is a national registry that
was launched in 2005 with the objective of collecting data
on patterns of care for patients with HNC. LORHAN was
designed to extend and complement general cancer registries by capturing more details on primary cancer treatments, toxicities, supportive care, and outcomes across
practice settings. LORHAN also differs from other registries in that it prospectively identified 2 hypotheses to test:
•

•

There is no difference in the pattern of care between
community and academic settings for patients with
HNC; and
The results of major randomized clinical trials will
change the pattern of care in community and academic
settings within 1 year of publication in peer-reviewed
journals.

Here, we report the first comprehensive analysis of
LORHAN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A multidisciplinary advisory board led LORHAN and
guided the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting.
Funding of the registry originally was provided by
ImClone Systems Inc. (Branchburg, NJ) and was assumed
by Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, Ind) after acquisition of ImClone in 2008. MedNet Solutions, Inc. (Minnetonka, Minn) administered LORHAN, including
providing the electronic data capture system, site, and statistical support, and advisory board management. Any
physician who was treating HNC and was willing to follow patients for at least 2 years was eligible to participate
in LORHAN. Sites were recruited through mass mailings
using society lists, the registry website, gatherings at medical conferences, and in-person visits. Investigators
received a modest stipend per patient, which was spread
out over 3 years to encourage entry of follow-up data.
MedNet Solutions Inc. provided site training using an
online, interactive tutorial or individual personal instruc5784

tion. Participating investigators could view their data
against the blinded aggregate database at any time. The
LORHAN advisory board had full access to data listings
and collaborated with MedNet Solutions Inc. on the
interpretation and publication of data. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01080313).
Eligibility

After institutional review board approval was obtained, eligible patients who provided written informed consent
were enrolled. Eligibility criteria were aged 18 years and
a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
new carcinoma involving the oral cavity, oropharynx,
nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or neck lymph node
metastasis from unknown origin. Patients must have been
scheduled to receive treatment other than surgery alone.
Principal investigators at each center designated their
practice setting as academic or community.
Data Collection

Information collected for LORHAN was considered part
of routine care. No additional assessments or evaluations
were required for registry participation. Data collected at
baseline included sex, race, weight, histology and location
of primary tumor, stage of disease and performance status,
type of prior surgery (debulking, staging, curative) if applicable, and enrollment in a clinical trial. During treatment, details on radiotherapy and systemic therapies
captured included dose, schedule, and duration. Data also
were entered on supportive care received, including use of
opioid analgesics, antiemetics, and feeding tubes. At the
completion of therapy, the best response to treatment and
incidence of selected toxicities were recorded. Retreatment information was collected for progressive disease.
Patients were followed for up to 4 years for disease and
vital status. Outcome data were collected at the end of
treatment/retreatment and during follow-up periods.
Data Entry and Management

Data were entered by the physicians or designees into electronic forms through the registry’s website. There were up
to 4 forms for any given patient: baseline, initial treatment
(cancer therapy and supportive care), follow-up, and,
when applicable, retreatment. Normal ranges were predefined by the LORHAN advisory board from which hard
edit checks were created. Data were subject to manual and
automated error checking during electronic entry with
procedures that searched for logical inconsistencies, out of
range values, and missing data. Error messages were generated when missing or inconsistent data were identified.
The form was ‘‘locked’’ once any error messages were

addressed and the physician reviewed and digitally signed
the form.
MedNet Solutions Inc. enforced restricted access
control mechanisms and incorporated encrypted pointto-point data transfer by secure HTTP protocols. Patient
and physician confidentiality was strictly maintained.
Study Design and Methods

The primary objective was to describe, in detail, patterns
of care for patients with HNC. Secondary objectives were
to determine the incidence and severity of major treatment toxicities; to identify supportive care received for
managing nutrition, pain, nausea, and other complications, and, subsequently, to document outcomes (tumor
control, survival).
The current analysis focused on describing patient
characteristics, treatment patterns, and early treatment
outcomes. For categorical and ordinal variables, frequencies and percentages were calculated. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, median,
standard deviation, and range) were used. To test the null
hypothesis, we used chi-square tests, t tests, and other
nonparametric tests as required. Survival-based analyses
were performed using Kaplan-Meier methodology with
censoring as appropriate and were evaluated using logrank tests with a 2-tailed P value  .05 to reject the null
hypothesis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
Cancer

assess the relation of prespecified independent variables to
selected site-related and treatment-related dichotomous
measures. Wald chi-square tests and likelihood ratio tests
were used to assess the significance of independent variables. Nonsignificant variables (eg, P > .05) were not
removed from the final models. Odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals also were calculated. All
analyses were performed using the statistical software
package R (version 2.12.0 or later; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna Austria; available at:
http://www.r-project.org/; accessed April 19, 2012).
RESULTS
Practice Characteristics

In total, 193 investigators from 100 sites enrolled patients.
Sites and distribution of patients mirrored data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database
(available at: http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/index.
html; accessed April 19, 2012) (Fig. 1). The majority
(77%) of principal investigators designated their setting as
a community practice.
Patient Characteristics

Between December 2005 and September 2010, 4243
patients were enrolled (Fig. 2), including 2612 patients
(62%) from academic investigators and 1631 patients
(38%) from community centers. Patients who were

treated in academic centers were slightly younger but had
relatively more advanced disease and poorer performance
status. In addition, more African Americans and higher
proportions of patients with oropharyngeal and sinonasal
tumors were treated in academic centers (Table 1). The
distribution of primary sites was similar to data from the
5786

Table 2 lists the initial cancer treatments and supportive
care. The most common treatment was radiation given
concurrently with either chemotherapy (CRT) (30%) or
biologic agent therapy (BRT) (cetuximab, 9%) followed
by postoperative radiotherapy (PORT), either with chemotherapy (14%) or without chemotherapy (7%). Other
treatment strategies were radiation alone (16%), induction chemotherapy followed by CRT/BRT (13%) or radiation (3%), and systemic therapy alone (2%). The
remaining 6% of patients received a variety of combinations of radiation and chemotherapy. Compared with the
entire population, a higher percentage of patients receiving chemotherapy alone had distant metastases at diagnosis (32% vs 2%).
Compared with the whole population, relatively
more patients with oral cavity tumors received PORT
(39% vs 21%), and less received CRT (16% vs 30%) or
induction chemotherapy followed by CRT/BRT (7% vs
13%). A smaller proportion of patients with oropharyngeal cancer received radiation alone (9%) or adjuvant
radiotherapy (4%), and a greater proportion received
CRT (36%). Almost 33% of patients with laryngeal cancer received radiation alone, and another 33% received
CRT or BRT.
Table 2 also indicates that intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has largely replaced 3-dimensional
(3-D) conformal or conventional radiation techniques,
particularly in academic centers (88% vs 78%; P <
.0001). The median radiation dose, number of fractions,
and duration were 70 grays (Gy) (interquartile range, 6670 Gy), 33 fractions (interquartile range, 30-35 fractions),
and 7 weeks, respectively. Once-daily radiation (5 fractions per week) was the most common fractionation
schedule used. Concomitant boost was used more frequently in an academic setting (15% vs 10% of patients; P
< .0001), and its use did not change significantly from
2006 to 2010. Twice-daily radiation (10 fractions per
week) was given infrequently (3% of patients) and did not
differ between settings.
Single-agent cisplatin was most common drug
(49%) and was prescribed more often in academic centers
than in the community (53% vs 43% of patients; P <
.0001). The drug was given most often every 3 to 4 weeks
(71% of patients) and weekly (14%). Cetuximab was the

next most common drug (19% of patients); and, in contrast to cisplatin, was prescribed more frequently in the
community (24% vs 17% of patients; P ¼ .0001). Multiagent chemotherapy regimens were prescribed less
frequently.
More than half of patients (58%) received a feeding
tube, either before or during treatment (Table 2). A feeding tube tended to be placed more often in patients who
were treated at academic centers and particularly during
treatment. The majority of patients were prescribed
opioid analgesics and antiemetics during treatment
(80% and 78% of patients, respectively) (Table 2). The

use of antiemetics in patients who were receiving chemotherapy was greater (92%) than that in the overall population. Prescribing of opioids and antiemetics was more
frequent in patients who were treated in academic
settings.
Differences in Patterns of Care

Multivariable analyses were undertaken to test the first hypothesis that, ‘‘There is no difference in the pattern of care
between community and academic settings for HNC
patients.’’ Several differences were observed (Table 3).

was a general pattern of bias toward an academic setting
until approximately age 70 years); larynx and oral cavity
cancers; treatment with BRT, CRT, or induction chemotherapy followed by radiation; placement of a feeding

associated with patients being more likely to be treated at
academic sites included non-Caucasian race, stage III/IV
disease at diagnosis, a Zubrod performance status of 1 or
2, treatment with radiation after initial surgery, placement

Impact of Major Clinical Trials

To test the second hypothesis that, ‘‘The results of
major randomized clinical trials will change the pattern

of care in community and academic settings within
1 year of publication in peer-reviewed journals,’’ use of
cetuximab and TPF was examined (Table 4). There
was no significant change in the use of the agents/
regimens after the publication of trial results in highimpact journals.
Outcomes

The median follow-up was 1.1 years for patients who
were included in the survival-based analyses, and the
maximum follow-up was 4.3 years. Locoregional control
and overall survival are illustrated in Figure 3. The 1year, 2-year, and 3-year rates of locoregional control
were 95%, 93%, and 92%, respectively; and the 1-year,
2-year, and 3-year rates of survival were 86%, 76%,

DISCUSSION
LORHAN is the largest repository of detailed treatment
data on patients with HNC in the United States. The
registry has provided important information on patterns
of care in everyday clinical practice, both for primary
treatment of disease and for supportive care, and it has
revealed differences in patient demographic and treatment
patterns between community and academic practice settings. Patients enrolled in LORHAN who were treated at
academic centers tended to be younger, had more
advanced disease, had fewer laryngeal cancers, and had a
poorer performance status compared with patients who
were treated in the community.
Overall, CRT, given either upfront or after surgery,
was prescribed most for patients with newly diagnosed
HNC. The combination of IMRT plus single-agent cisplatin was received frequently. Few patients received multidrug regimens, either as induction or with radiation.
Most patients received a feeding tube, opioid analgesics,
and antiemetics. Patterns of care at academic settings
included the receipt of adjuvant CRT/BRT, IMRT, single-agent cisplatin, TPF/cetuximab, tracheotomy, opioid
analgesics, and antiemetics. Patients who were treated in
5790

the community more often received BRT, radiation
alone, conventional and 3-dimensional conformal radiation, single-agent cetuximab, TPF, PF, and amifostine.
These differences may be explained in part by differences
in baseline patient characteristics, although several of
these differences persisted after controlling for important
covariates. Differences in receipt of IMRT may be
explained by a differing level of access to new radiation
technologies in the community because of the substantial
training and upfront investment required. The higher use
of cetuximab and amifostine in the community suggests
that similar barriers do not exist for the adoption of new
drugs. It is possible that physicians in academic settings
viewed the data for these drugs differently than those in
the community. The higher use of tracheotomy in academic settings may reflect the preferential referral of
patients with airway compromise to these centers,
although it is interesting to note that more patients with
laryngeal cancers were treated in the community, and the
proportion with hypopharyngeal tumors was equal
between the 2 settings.
Broad adoption of treatments from major trials
within 1 year of publication in high-impact journals was
not observed. In the cetuximab trial,10 analyses may have
been hampered by the lack of a true baseline period and
an insufficient sample size. It is possible that acceptance of

cetuximab was heavily influenced after the presentation of
the data at the American Society for Clinical Oncology
meeting in June 2004,14 18 months before the first
patient was enrolled in LORHAN. By the time the publication came out in February 2006, the study results may
have been perceived as ‘‘old news.’’ The distribution suggests that cetuximab probably is prescribed when contraindications for cisplatin exist.
It is rather surprising that the 3 major positive trials
on TPF did not appear to broadly influence daily clinical
practice within 1 year of their publication. A plausible explanation is that these scientifically important trials produced a treatment option that can be adopted as an
alternative to, rather than as a replacement for, the already
well established radiation-cisplatin platform in the United
States. It is therefore likely that most oncologists are
awaiting the results of phase 3 trials comparing induction
TPF followed by CRT versus concurrent radiation-cisplaCancer

tin alone before routinely adopting induction TPF into
their practice. It is also possible that the additional toxicity
of a taxane, although manageable in the context of a clinical trial, was more problematic in busy daily clinical
practice.
The generalizability of the findings from LORHAN
depends on the representativeness and quality of the data.
Enrollment in LORHAN required written informed consent by the patient; and, although participating physicians
were encouraged to approach all eligible patients, we do
not know how many patients declined or whether and
how these patients differed from those who participated.
Another potential bias is the positive selection of physicians with a self-declared interest in HNC or physicians
with a bias in favor of cetuximab, a product marketed by
the registry sponsor, Eli Lilly and Company. However,
the distribution and characteristics of cases suggest that
patients participating in LORHAN are similar to those in
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. A strength of LORHAN is that few patients were
lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. The most common
reason for registry discontinuation was death. Data logic
and consistency were monitored on an ongoing basis by
the LORHAN advisory board. Reports of outliers were
generated and sites were contacted to confirm data points,
as needed. Although information entered into LORHAN
was not audited against source documents, these reviews
provide some measure against systematic error. Random
error is likely addressed by the size of LORHAN. Interpreting the outcomes of LORHAN would have benefited
from information on the quality of radiation planning
and delivery, but such efforts require substantial funding
to complete.
In summary, LORHAN has documented differences in the treatment of patients in community and academic settings for a series of patients in the United States.
The establishment of similar registries outside the United
States would provide the means for geographic comparisons and should be pursued. Future analyses of LORHAN
will focus on questions that can be addressed uniquely by
the registry, such as disparities in care and shifting treatment paradigms in specific diseases like oropharyngeal
cancer.
