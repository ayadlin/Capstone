BACKGROUND: Some copy number alterations (CNAs) have independent prognostic significance for adults with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). METHODS: This study analyzed via multiplex ligation–dependent probe amplification the frequency and prognostic
impact of CNAs of 12 genetic regions in 142 adolescents and adults with de novo precursor B-cell ALL. RESULTS: The cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) deletion (59 of 142 or 42%) was the most frequent CNA, and it was followed by Ikaros
family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) losses (49 of 142 or 35%). IKZF1 deletions were more prevalent in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive
ALL and were associated with advanced age and high white blood cell (WBC) counts. The multivariate analysis showed that
advanced age and early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) deletions were associated with chemotherapy resistance in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 0.949 and 0.135, respectively) and the Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 0.946 and 0.118, respectively). High WBC
counts and focal IKZF1 deletions correlated with disease recurrence (hazard ratios, 1.005 and 1.869, respectively), whereas advanced
age and CDKN2A/B losses influenced overall survival in both the whole series (hazard ratios, 1.038 and 2.545, respectively) and the
Ph-negative subgroup (hazard ratios, 1.044 and 2.105, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of EBF1, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B have
an independent adverse prognosis for adolescents and adults with B-precursor ALL, and this suggests that these CNAs should be

INTRODUCTION
The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) depends on age, white blood cell (WBC) counts, and genetic features1; the response to therapy, assessed with the minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance, is the most important prognostic factor at any age.2
Chromosome aberrations are key drivers of leukemogenesis, but additional abnormalities are required for leukemia
development.3 Sequence mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), and losses of heterozygosity in genes involved in
lymphoid development, cell cycle, and tumor suppression have been studied in pediatric ALL,4,5 with deletions of Ikaros

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Statistical Analyses

Patients, Diagnosis, and Treatment

The following variables were included: sex, age, WBC
count, and BM blast percentage (as continuous variables);
central nervous system involvement; immunological phenotype (pro-B, common, or pre-B); cytogenetic subgroup;
risk category; and treatment results. Complete remission
(CR) was defined as the absence of extramedullary disease,
a neutrophil level > 1 3 109/L, a platelet level > 100 3
109/L, and a BM blast level < 5%. Relapse was defined as
disease recurrence at any site after CR. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was calculated from the date of CR
to the date of relapse; patients not known to have relapsed
were censored on the date of their last visit. Overall survival
(OS) was measured from the time of entry into the protocol
to the time of death or last follow-up.
Associations of CNAs, comparisons of proportions,
and rankings of variables between groups were performed
with the chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, the KruskalWallis H test, and the median test as appropriate. For each
CNA, the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used
for univariate comparisons of CR, and actuarial curves of
CIR and OS were plotted with the Kaplan-Meier method
and were compared with the log-rank test. A secondary
analysis of CIR and OS was performed, with the transplant
patients censored at the time of HSCT. In addition, relapse
mortality and nonrelapse mortality were analyzed as competing events with Gray’s test. The CNAs and the clinical
and biological variables (age, WBC count, immunological
subtype, cytogenetic subgroup, number of CNAs, and
treatment) with P values lower than .1 in univariate analyses were included in multivariate models. A binary logistic
regression model was used to identify predictive factors for
CR attainment, whereas multivariate analyses for CIR and

ALL was diagnosed by bone marrow (BM) cytomorphology, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and molecular
testing for mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and breakpoint
cluster region-Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene
(BCR-ABL1). Cytogenetics was performed at individual
centers, and karyotype reports were centrally reviewed.16
Informed consent was obtained from patients for molecular
analysis. The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol.
High-risk ALL was defined as the fulfillment of any
of the following criteria: age > 30 years, WBC count > 30
3 109/L, MLL rearrangements, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), or
slow response to therapy as assessed by >10% BM blasts
on day 14 of induction. MRD was included for treatment
decisions in the most recent trials.17 Patients with
standard-risk ALL were treated with pediatric-based
chemotherapy,18 whereas patients with high-risk ALL
received chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT).17,19 Since 2002,
patients with Ph-positive ALL have received chemotherapy and imatinib upfront, and these have been followed
by HSCT in patients younger than 55 years.20
Analysis of CNAs

DNA samples from BM or peripheral blood with a minimal
proportion of blasts of 30% (stored at 12 Spanish centers)
were processed. DNA (50-100 ng) was subjected to multiplex ligation–dependent probe amplification (MLPA) reactions with both P335 and P202 SALSA MLPA kits (MRCHolland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) according to the

From these, 142 patients were selected on the basis of the
availability of stored DNA and adequate follow-up data.
No significant differences were found in comparisons of
tested and untested patients with respect to demographic
variables, clinical variables, or outcomes.
The main clinical and biological characteristics of
the series are shown in Table 1. The median age was 40
years (range, 15-74 years). t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 was the
most recurrent genetic abnormality. Risk subgroups
included 124 patients with high-risk ALL and 18 with
standard-risk ALL.

OS were performed with the Cox proportional hazards
regression model. No imputation method was used for
missing data. The significance level was set at P < .05.
RESULTS
Descriptive Analysis of the Cohort

CDKN2A/B deletions were the most frequent abnormality
(42%), whereas IKZF1 deletions were more frequent in
Ph-positive cases than Ph-negative cases (Table 2). Most
of the IKZF1 deletions were heterozygous (43 of 49), 13
patients showed whole gene deletions, and the remaining
36 presented with focal gene deletions. Focal deletions
were more prevalent in Ph-positive cases than Ph-negative
cases (13 of 14 vs 23 of 35; P 5 .050). Patients with
IKZF1 deletions were older (median, 48 years [range, 1574 years] vs 38 years [range, 15-72 years]; P 5 .033) and
showed higher WBC counts at presentation (median,

[range, 0.4-364.8 3 109/L]; P 5 .010) than those with
wild-type (WT) IKZF1. Among Ph-negative patients,
IKZF1 deletions also correlated with leukocytosis (median, 18 3 109/L [range, 1.5-388 3 109/L] for IKZF1
deletions vs 9.6 3 109/L [range, 0.4-364.8 3 109/L]

Table 1 (see online supporting information) shows the
CNA associations. As for the number of CNAs per
patient, 26 (18%) did not show any CNAs, 25 (18%) had
1 CNA, 22 (16%) presented with 2 CNAs, 22 (16%)
showed 3 CNAs, and 47 (32%) harbored >3 CNAs.
CDKN2A/B loss (n 5 50) was the most recurrent
event in patients exhibiting 3 or more CNAs, whereas
IKZF1 was the most frequently deleted gene in patients
harboring 1 or 2 CNAs (7 of 25 patients and 12 of 22
patients, respectively). IKZF1-deleted patients showed
more additional CNAs than undeleted patients (median, 4
[range, 1-10] vs 2 [range, 0-7]; P 5 .033) without differences in the number of whole and focal gene deletion carriers
(median, 4 [range, 1-8] vs 3.5 [range, 1-10]; P 5 .348) or
in the frequency of homozygous or heterozygous losses
(median, 2.5 [range, 1-4] vs 4 [range, 1-10]; P 5 .116).
CDKN2A/B-deleted patients also showed a higher number
3812

of CNAs than nondeleted individuals (4 [range, 1-10] vs 1
[range, 0-6]; P < .001). No specific cytogenetic subgroup
was found to be enriched with a higher or lower number of
CNAs with the exception of MLL-rearranged patients, in
whom fewer CNAs were detected (median, 0.5 [range, 0-3]
vs 3 [range, 0-10] for the remaining; P 5 .005).
Prognostic Significance of CNAs

The CR rate for the whole series was 85% (121 of 142
patients). With a median follow-up of 3.7 years [range,
0.6-11.3 years], the 5-year CIR and OS probabilities for
the whole series were 46% [range, 35%-57%] and 43%
[range, 34%-52%], respectively. The CIR probability was
46% [range, 34%-58%] for Ph-negative patients and
44% [range, 16%-72%] for Ph-positive patients, and the
OS probabilities were 44% [range, 34%-54%] and 37%
[range, 10%-64%], respectively.

The univariate analysis showed that EBF1-deleted
patients had lower CR rates than undeleted individuals in
the whole series and in the Ph-negative cohort. In addition,
IKZF1 deletions had a negative impact on CR in the Phnegative subgroup and showed a trend in the whole series
(Supporting Table 2 [see online supporting information]).
IKZF1 deletions were significantly associated with a
higher CIR in the whole series (Fig. 1A and Supporting
Table 2 [see online supporting information]) and in the
Ph-negative cohort. According to the competing risk analysis, the relapse incidence was 58% (range, 41%-75%) for
IKZF1-deleted patients and 40% (range, 28%-52%,
P 5 .048) for patients without deletions, and there were
no differences in nonrelapse mortality (19% [range, 6%32%] vs 17% [range, 8%-26%], P 5 .780). Patients with
focal deletion (n 5 27) showed worse CIR than those

tantly, whole gene deletion patients showed a CIR similar
to that of WT IKZF1 individuals in both the whole series
(Fig. 1C) and the Ph-negative cohort. A trend toward a
higher CIR was observed in IKZF1-deleted patients harboring additional CNAs (n 5 32) versus patients with isolated IKZF1 loss (n 5 6; 5-year CIR, 79% [range, 62%96%] for IKZF1 loss with additional CNAs vs 20%
[range, 0%-55%] for isolated IKZF1 loss; P 5 .070).
Patients with focal IKZF1 deletions and >3 additional
CNAs (n 5 12) had a higher CIR than patients with focal
IKZF1 deletions and 3 CNAs (n 5 15; 5-year CIR,
89% [range, 69%-100%] for >3 CNAs vs 71% [range,
44%-98%] for 3 CNAs; P 5 .025). On the other hand,
focal IKZF1 deletions correlated with a higher relapse propensity among patients with a high burden of CNAs (>3
CNAs; n 5 12) because these patients showed a 5-year
CIR of 89% (range, 79%-100%) versus 67% (range,
38%-96%) for patients without focal IKZF1 deletions
and >3 CNAs (n 5 25; P 5 .003). As for OS, IKZF1
deletions also had a negative impact on patients’ prognoses in the whole series (Fig. 1B) and in the Ph-negative
cohort, and there were no differences between focal and
whole gene losses. The same results were observed after
the censoring of patients at the time of HSCT (data not
shown).
Deletions of CDKN2A/B were associated with a
higher CIR in both the whole series (Fig. 2A) and the Phnegative cohort without differences between heterozygous
and homozygous losses (79% [range, 58%-100%] vs 51%
[range, 24%-78%]; P 5 .486). According to competing
risk analysis, the relapse incidence was 54% (range, 39%69%) for CDKN2A/B-deleted patients and 41% (range,
27%-55%) for undeleted patients (P 5 .063), and there
were no differences in nonrelapse mortality (26% [range,
13%-39%] vs 12% [range, 4%-20%]; P 5 .217). In addition, CDKN2A/B deletions were associated with a lower
OS in the whole series (Supporting Table 2 [see online
supporting information] and Fig. 2B) and in both the Phnegative and Ph-positive subgroups, with no differences
being found in comparisons of homozygous and heterozygous losses. Finally, patients with >3 CNAs (n 5 47) had
higher CIR and lower OS probabilities than those with
3 CNAs (n 5 95) in the whole series (Fig. 3A,B) and in
the Ph-negative subgroup. Similar results were observed
after the censoring of patients at the time of HSCT (data
not shown).

CIR in the whole series and in the Ph-negative subgroup,
whereas IKZF1 deletions were associated with a higher
CIR for the whole series. Age and CDKN2A/B deletions
had a negative impact on OS for the whole series, and age,
high WBC counts, and CDKN2A/B deletions impaired
the prognosis for the Ph-negative subgroup.

DISCUSSION
This study shows that the genes most frequently deleted
in adolescent and adult patients with B-precursor ALL are
CDKN2A/B, IKZF1 and PAX5, with IKZF1 being the
most frequently deleted gene in Ph-positive patients.
Microdeletions in EBF1, IKZF1, and CDKN2A/B were
associated with the poorest outcomes, and these molecular
markers had prognostic significance independent of age,
WBC counts, and cytogenetic subtypes, regardless of
3814

HSCT. Patients with whole IKZF1 deletions had a significantly lower CIR than those with focal deletions.
The frequency of IKZF1 deletions in Ph-negative
patients was similar to that described in the Group for
Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
(GRAALL) study.15 However, the frequency in Phpositive patients was lower than that observed by Gruppo
Italiano
Malattie
Ematologiche
dell’Adulto
(GIMEMA)14 and slightly higher than that reported by
UK Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (UKALL)/Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) for Ph-negative
patients.12 IKZF1 deletions are more recurrent in highrisk patients than standard-risk patients, and their frequency increases with age,21 as observed in the current
study. The GIMEMA study showed a higher median age,
and the UKALL/ECOG cohort included younger
patients with standard-risk ALL in comparison with our
high-risk enriched series.
EBF1 deletions were associated with an increased
risk of treatment failure. Moorman et al12 reported that
EBF1-deleted Ph-negative adolescent and adult patients
showed lower CR rates and poorer event-free survival and
OS than nondeleted individuals. Mullighan et al7
reported that IKZF1 and EBF1 losses were strongly associated with higher levels of MRD on day 29 of induction.
EBF1 losses were enriched in the ETV6-RUNX1 subtype
(the most common cytogenetic aberration in childhood
B-cell ALL), although this is rarely observed in adult Bcell ALL.4 Harvey et al22 showed that EBF1 deletions
were present in only the 2 poorest outcome groups in a series of 207 children with high-risk ALL, and they correlated with the BCR-ABL1–like signature. Den Boer et al23
showed that EBF1 deletions were exclusively present in
the BCR-ABL1–like subtype and were associated with resistance to L-asparaginase and daunorubicin. Interestingly,
we observed frequent EBF1 and PAX5 codeletions in
addition to the recurrent EBF1-IKZF1 codeletion, and
this suggests a synergistic effect. Because these 3 genes are
key elements of B-cell development,24 their abnormal
function could play a role in the preservation of stem cell–
like properties important for drug resistance. In line
with this observation, multiple deletions in lymphoid
development genes are frequently observed in Ph-like
patients.22,23,25
IKZF1 deletions were identified as an independent
prognostic factor for CIR in the whole series but not in
the Ph-negative subgroup. The low number of Phpositive patients does not allow specific conclusions to be
drawn regarding the prognosis. Moorman et al12 reported
a trend of IKZF1 deletions decreasing relapse-free survival

in a univariate analysis of adolescents and adults with Phnegative ALL, and Martinelli et al14 showed that IKZF1
deletions hampered disease-free survival in Ph-positive
ALL. Beldjord et al15 identified IKZF1 deletions as independent markers of CIR in adults with Ph-negative ALL.
On the other hand, we observed a higher relapse propensity in patients harboring IKZF1 deletions along with
additional CNAs in comparison with patients with isolated IKZF1 loss, and this suggests that the unfavorable
prognosis of IKZF1 deletions may be attributable to
genetic instability.9 However, among our patients with
>3 CNAs, IKZF1 loss was a marker of relapse, and this
suggests that it may be a poor prognostic factor per se.
In our study, a significantly higher CIR was
observed for patients with focal IKZF1 deletions versus
whole IKZF1 deletions. Indeed, the CIR of patients with
Cancer

November 1, 2015

WT IKZF1 and whole IKZF1 deletions were similar, as
shown in the study from the GRAALL group.15 In normal
hematopoiesis, the activity of the Ikaros transcription factor is autoregulated by the balance between long and short
isoforms generated by alternative splicing. Patients with
focal deletions express more truncated isoforms, which in
the majority of cases act as dominant-negative proteins
(Ik6) and interfere with the normal function of Ikaros and
other IKZF family members.26 We speculate that Ikaros
proteins encoded by the WT IKZF1 allele in whole gene
deletion patients are less hindered by short dominantnegative isoforms in comparison with patients with focal
deletions, and this results in a lower CIR in these patients.
Because our observations were made from follow-up data
for 10 patients with a whole gene deletion and 27 patients
with a focal gene deletion, further studies should be performed to clarify this hypothesis.
CDKN2A/B deletions correlated with a high number
of additional CNAs and a poor prognosis, and this suggests that CDKN2A loss may lead to genetic instability
because it is involved in cell cycle progression. The prognostic significance for adult ALL is controversial. Iacobucci et al13 reported that CDKN2A/B deletions had
independent significance for lower disease-free survival in
a series of 112 adult Ph-positive patients, but other
authors did not show any prognostic impact.27 No differences in outcomes were observed from a comparison of
heterozygous and homozygous CDKN2A/B deletions,12
and this suggests an important haplo-insufficiency effect28
or concomitant inactivation of the remaining allele by epigenetic events.29,30
Although our patients were treated within protocols,
some limitations should be pointed out. First, the low
number of standard-risk ALL and Ph-positive patients limited the validity of our results for these specific subgroups.
Second, the lack of data regarding the MRD status for
most of the patients made the evaluation of the prognosis
according to both the information provided by the genetic
study and the pattern of MRD clearance not possible, as
recently shown.15 Finally, because MLPA is a technique
with limited sensitivity, we selected samples with a blast
burden  30%.31,32 With this approach, we assumed that,
for instance, approximately 3% of WT IKZF1 samples
may have had subclonal populations with Ikaros deletions
not detected by MLPA in contrast to what could have been
found with polymerase chain reaction.32
The results of the current study could help to refine
the risk stratification of adolescent and adult ALL patients
according to their genetic features. Remarkably, EBF1
deletions had an impact on the CR rate, IKZF1 deletions

were markers of the relapse propensity, and CDKN2A/B
deletions were associated with a reduction in OS in both
the whole series and the Ph-negative ALL series. Whole
IKZF1 gene deletions may not be critical for a patient’s
outcome in contrast to focal deletions, and a high CNA
burden should also be considered in IKZF1-deleted
patients. These results did not change after the censoring
of transplant patients at the time of HSCT. However,
because of the controversial prognostic significance of
some CNAs in ALL, more studies of uniformly treated
patients should be performed to clarify the prognostic
impact of these and other genetic alterations.
