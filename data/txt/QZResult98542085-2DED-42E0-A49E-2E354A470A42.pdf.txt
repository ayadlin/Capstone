BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) represents a devastating complication of systemic
cancer, and patients with LC have a dismal prognosis and increased mortality. The few studies that have
focused on the evaluation of prognostic factors in patients with LC have resulted in contradictory results.
Thus, the treatment of LC remains controversial, and no straightforward guidelines exist in the literature.
The objective of the current study was to identify prognostic markers related to LC survival to better select
patients who are eligible for intensive treatment. METHODS: Seventy patients who had a diagnosis of LC
were reviewed, and clinical data, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, tumor-related characteristics, and
treatment information were registered. The impact of single parameters on overall survival was determined
by both univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis revealed that Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group score 2 (P ¼ .028), a glucose level in CSF 2.7 mmol/L (P ¼ .001), the presence
of infratentorial symptoms at onset (P ¼ .026), and intrathecal treatment (P < .001) were associated independently with longer overall survival in patients with LC. In addition, the same clinical factors also predicted response to treatment in such patients. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive factors for patients with LC
that were identified in this study could help to better select patients who are more likely to benefit from

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a devastating complication of systemic cancer that occurs
in 5% to 10% of patients with solid tumors, more frequently adenocarcinoma, and is observed most commonly in patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma.1-11 Recently, an increased incidence of
LC was observed because of the development of new, effective antineoplastic treatments against primary
tumors and improvements in neuroimaging techniques.7,12
Overall, current treatments offer a poor outcome and a high frequency of treatment-related toxicity. Without therapy, the median survival is 4 to 6 weeks, which can be extended to 4 months to 6 months with chemotherapy in selected patients.13 In most studies, at least 55% of treated patients die within a few weeks after
starting treatment. There is only a 20% response to treatment, and the median survival is 4 months, although

some patients can survive for >1 year. To date, these significant differences in survival rates in LC have not been
explained and remain unpredictable.14,15
Prognostic factors in LC may help the clinician to
select the patients who would benefit most from chemotherapy. However, studies focused on the evaluation of
prognostic markers in patients with LC have produced
contradictory results, most likely because of methodologic
differences among them. There are weaknesses in the
studies: Some have included in their series hematologic or
primary brain tumors, they show important differences in
sample size and analyzed variables, they have evaluated
selected subsets of patients, and only univariate analyses
were considered.5,9,11,13-20,22 Accordingly, currently,
there are no useful prognostic markers, except for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) blocks,23,24 that could help clinicians
to decide the best therapeutic approach for patients with
LC. The objective of this study was to identify prognostic
factors related to LC survival and enable clinicians to
select patients who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventy patients who were diagnosed with LC at the University Hospital of Bellvitge between 1990 and 2007 were
evaluated. Patients with leptomeningeal infiltration either
from hematologic malignancies or primary brain tumors
were not included in the current analysis. The diagnosis of
LC was based on the detection of malignant cells in CSF
(n ¼ 62 patients) or on the demonstration of findings
consistent with LC on neuraxis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biochemical abnormalities in the CSF, and
suitable clinical signs and symptoms.

Evaluated Parameters
Demographic data, clinical features, primary tumor characteristics, CSF findings, and treatment were evaluated.
The clinical features at LC presentation were classified
into 5 groups according to their origin: 1) supratentorial
symptoms (seizures, cognitive impairment, difficulty in
walking, sensory or unexplained weakness from brain metastases, decreased visual acuity without endocranial
hypertension, and dysphasia), 2) infratentorial symptoms

other symptoms, and 5) encephalopathy. Patients were
included in only 1 group according to their main clinical
manifestations at onset. To further evaluate patients’
physical capability, the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) neurologic functional status score (Table
1) at the time of LC diagnosis was calculated.25 The
RTOG score was used because it was estimated more reliably from medical records when data regarding Karnofsky
performance status (KPS) were not available.
Regarding tumor-related characteristics, the histology and location of the primary tumor, the primary disease status (stable or response vs progression), and the
presence or absence of brain metastases at the time of LC
diagnosis were analyzed. CSF findings included fluid cytology as well as measurement of glucose and protein concentrations at LC presentation.
With respect to treatment, previously administered
chemotherapy regimens for the primary neoplasm, time
from the primary tumor diagnosis to the onset of LC, and
therapy for LC were evaluated. Indeed, regarding treatment of LC, 36 patients (51.4%) received intrathecal
methotrexate administered by lumbar puncture at a dose
of 10 mg twice weekly. Ten of these patients also received
systemic concomitant chemotherapy, and 6 patients also
received systemic adjuvant chemotherapy and wholebrain irradiation. Finally, the remaining 34 patients

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival,
which we measured from the date of LC diagnosis to the
date of either last follow-up visit or death. The date of LC
diagnosis was defined as the date of the first positive cytologic study or the date of MRI diagnostic scans, depending on the diagnostic criteria. The analysis was performed
for both in the whole series, to identify prognostic variables, and for the treatment group, to identify predictive
factors of response to treatment. The univariate analysis
was made by constructing probability curves according to
the Kaplan-Meier method and comparing them by using
the log-rank test. Variables that achieved a P value <.1 in
the univariate analysis subsequently were introduced in a
backward stepwise proportional-hazard analysis (Cox
model) to identify independent predictors of survival.

the study are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Thirty-six
patients received intrathecal chemotherapy, as mentioned
above, and the remaining 34 patients received only best
supportive care. Because treatment decisions were made
arbitrarily, the 2 groups of patients were compared with
respect to baseline characteristics to identify any potential
bias. Indeed, differences regarding age at presentation and
CSF parameters were observed: Patients in the treatment
group were younger (median age, 51 years [range, 35-74
years] vs 61 years [range, 37-84 years]; P < .001), had
higher glucose levels in CSF (median, 3.3 mmol/L [range,
0.9-8mmol/L] vs 1.85 mmol/L [range, 0.07-6 mmol/L];
P < .001), and had lower protein levels in CSF (median,

0.76 g/L [range, 0.15-9.4 g/L] vs 1.4 g/L [range, 0.2725.8 g/L]; P < .028) than patients in the palliative group.

Survival and Prognostic Factors
The median overall survival was 21 days (range, 1-2155
days). In the univariate analysis, age, sex, RTOG score,
glucose levels in CSF, breast cancer as primary tumor,
infratentorial symptoms at onset, and intrathecal chemotherapy were identified as variables that had prognostic
influence on survival (Table 4). The Cox regression model
revealed that an RTOG score 2 (hazard ratio [HR],

.006), glucose levels in CSF 2.7 mmol/L (HR, 2.2; 95%
CI, 1.04-4.66; P ¼ .04), the presence of infratentorial
symptoms at onset (HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.62-5.87; P ¼
.001), and intrathecal chemotherapy (HR, 3.65; 95% CI,
1.55-8.6; P ¼ .003) were associated independently with
longer overall survival. In addition, breast cancer as the
primary tumor had a marked tendency to indicate a better
prognosis (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.93-3.81; P ¼ .079).
In patients who received intrathecal chemotherapy,
the median overall survival was 108 days (range, 8-2155
days). In the univariate analysis, the factors that influenced overall survival were sex, RTOG score, encephalopathy, infratentorial symptoms at onset, and glucose levels
in CSF. The Cox regression model revealed that an
RTOG score 2 (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69; P ¼
.005), glucose levels in CSF 2.7 mmol/L (HR, 0.21;
95% CI, 0.08-0.58; P ¼ .002), and the presence of infratentorial symptoms at onset (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.070.55; P ¼ .002) were independent predictive variables.

Scoring Scale for Predicting Patient
Survival
The RTOG score, glucose levels in CSF, and the presence
of infratentorial symptoms at onset were selected as prognostic factors in the whole series and in the subset of
treated patients, and we included those 3 parameters in an
equation to estimate the probability of survival in patients
with LC. To calculate the index, each variable was scored
as 0 or 1 according to the absence or presence, respectively, of the favorable category. Subsequently, to evaluate
the prognostic significance of this index, patients were
classified into 2 groups: Group 1 (unfavorable group)
included patients who scored 0 or 1 points, and Group 2
(favorable group) included patients who scored 2 or 3
points. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that this prognostic index allowed an accurate classification of patients
with respect to their probability of survival (Fig. 1).
Indeed, patients in Group 2 had a probability of remaining alive that was nearly 3 times greater than the probability for patients in Group 1 (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.675.59; P ¼ .0003), with 50% of the patients in Group 2
surviving for >3 months; whereas the majority of patients
in Group 1 died within 1 month.
To ascertain the reliability of the prognostic index,
we also evaluated its predictive capability in some subsets

of patients. In fact, the score maintained its prognostic
value in patients who had breast cancer (HR, 6.45; 95%
CI, 1.99-20.94; P ¼ .002) and lung cancer (HR, 2.58;
95% CI, 1.03-6.48; P ¼ .044) as their primary tumor
(Fig. 2A,B) and in patients who received intrathecal
chemotherapy (HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.48-8.51; P ¼ .005)
or only best supportive care (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.016.43; P ¼ .049) (Fig. 3A,B).

DISCUSSION
LC remains largely incurable despite current therapeutic
approaches, and there remain reasonable doubts regarding
which patients with LC have a better chance of achieving
better responses or even longer survival after treatment. In
this setting, our current results suggest that the presence of
infratentorial symptoms and an RTOG score 2 at LC
presentation, glucose levels in CSF 2.7 mmol/L, and intrathecal chemotherapy are the factors associated independently with longer overall survival in patients with

that responds best to therapy.2,5,12,26 However, our results
suggest that, based on the selected clinical prognostic factors, the calculated prognostic index allowed the classification of patients into different prognostic groups regardless

of their primary neoplasm. In addition, the current study
allowed us to identify not only prognostic factors of survival but also predictive factors of survival in treated
patients based on multivariate analysis. The evaluation of
predictive factors of survival in LC has been limited
because of the relatively small size of the studies and their
mostly retrospective nature,3,13-15,17-22,27-29 and only a

regression
approaches.3,6,12,14,18 In this sense, data obtained in previous studies are sometimes controversial, resulting in a lack
of consensus regarding consistent predictors of survival
(Table 5). Hence, 1 of the most noteworthy aspects of the
current study is the finding that its results are derived
from an actual clinical setting. Although randomized clinical trials represent the best approach to comparing 2 different therapeutic options, their stringent inclusion and
exclusion criteria obviously induce a selection bias. In the
current study, in addition to intrathecal chemotherapy,
the same set of criteria were identified as independent predictive factors of survival and response to treatment, not
only reinforcing their prognostic value but also validating
the clinical judgment used for selecting those patients
who should have been treated. In addition, despite the
limitations of a retrospective study, patients in the current
analysis had clinical features at LC onset, primary tumorrelated characteristics, and survival curves similar to those
in previously reported series,3,13,18 thus reducing a potential selection bias.
In particular, in this study, we identified 3 pretreatment prognostic variables with relevance that could be reinforced by several factors. First, CSF glucose levels and
their prognostic meaning can be explained by the consumption of glucose by a mass of circulating tumor cells
or by a widespread involvement of the meninges that may
result in impaired transfer and, hence, may contribute to
lower glucose concentrations.14,16 Second, the meaning
of RTOG neurological scores can be explained because
they constitute a functional status scale25,30 and, similar
to the others, they are well known prognostic markers in
cancer.31-33 It is very likely that the use of the KPS would
reinforce the results obtained with the RTOG scale
regarding its prognostic significance. In that sense, according to our data, an RTOG score 2 corresponds to a KPS
60. Third, the favorable meaning of infratentorial
symptoms was an unexpected finding, because some
reports have described nerve palsy as a marker of poor
387

prognosis.14 However, it should be noted that supratentorial symptoms also have been identified as a poor prognostic factor in other series.3 In our study, the group of
infratentorial symptoms included spinal symptoms from
radicular and medullar involvement, as in previous
reports,29 as well as cranial nerve palsy (excluding optic
nerve involvement) without endocranial hypertension.
Most patients with cranial nerve involvement in our series
had endocranial hypertension, and they were classified
into the group with endocranial hypertension plus other
symptoms. It is tempting to hypothesize that the relevance
of nerve involvement depends on whether it is accompanied by endocranial hypertension in accord with the
nearly significant correlation observed with this variable.
Supporting this observation, previous studies have identified encephalopathy as a parameter of poor prognosis,34
and endocranial hypertension most likely is involved in
the onset of this process.
Although the side effects of intensive therapy and
the lack reversibility of fixed neurologic deficits most
likely lead to a nihilist therapeutic attitude and an under
diagnosis of LC, early diagnosis and treatment of LC provides good palliation, local disease control, and improved
quality of life for patients who respond to treatment.6,12
Our study, despite its retrospective nature and the need
for future validation, contributes to the elucidation of
prognostic and predictive factors and provides us with an
easy-to-use composite score for determining which
patients with LC may benefit from chemotherapy. This
has obvious application in clinical management and in the
design of future therapeutic trials.
