Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tamoxifen has both cytostatic and cytotoxic properties for breast cancer. Tamoxifen engaged
mitochondrial estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) as an antagonist in MCF-7 BK cells, increasing
reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations from the mitochondria that were required for
cytotoxicity. In part this derived from tamoxifen down-regulating manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD) activity through nitrosylating tyrosine 34, thereby increasing ROS. ROS
activated protein kinase C delta and c-jun N-terminal kinases, resulting in the mitochondrial
translocation of Bax and cytochrome C release. Interestingly, tamoxifen failed to cause high ROS
levels or induce cell death in MCF7BK-TR cells due to stimulation of MnSOD activity through
agonistic effects at mitochondrial ERβ. In several mouse xenograft models, lentiviral shRNAinduced knockdown of MnSOD caused tumors that grew in the presence of tamoxifen to undergo
substantial apoptosis. Tumor MnSOD and mitochondrial ERβ are therefore targets for therapeutic
intervention to reverse tamoxifen resistance and enhance a cell death response.

Tamoxifen (TAM) often prevents primary breast tumor formation or causes the regression

radiation and chemotherapies are effective because they induce tumor cell death 4,5 and
resistance to adjuvant therapies may arise when treatment does not cause apoptosis.
Therefore it is important to understand the mechanisms involved to enhance cell death.
Resistance to TAM develops in as many as 50% of women taking this adjuvant endocrine
therapy for breast cancer.6 Both primary (de novo) and secondary (acquired) resistance
occurs, and several mechanisms have been proposed. One supported mechanism of
resistance is that TAM engages plasma membrane ERα as an agonist, trans-activating
members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family including ErbB1 and ErbB2.7 As a
result, downstream kinases such as PI3K/AKT enhance growth in part by stimulating steroid
receptor coactivator-3 expression and function,8 or the down-regulation of the growth
inhibitory. PAX-2 nuclear protein.9 Current efforts to overcome TAM resistance are
centered on the inhibition of both ER and ErbB family signaling.7

Author Manuscript

Numerous, interactive pathways mediate the growth and survival of breast cancers and may
underlie resistance to TAM-induced cell death. Here we investigated these mechanisms and
demonstrated a novel difference in TAM responsive or resistant cells. The key mediator of
the differential responses to TAM is the relative generation of mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (mt-ROS) that induces the intrinsic apoptosis program. TAM engages the
mitochondrial ERβ receptor as an antagonist or agonist to differentially regulate manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity that impacts ROS levels. Thus, MnSOD is a target
to ensure TAM induced apoptosis We further propose this ER pool serves as an ROS
rheostat to determine cell fate responses to TAM.

Western blot. E2 (Steraloids), PPT (ERα agonist) and DPN (ERβ agonist) (Tocris), and
Flag-human-WT and Y34F MnSOD plasmids (Origene) were obtained. Two siRNAs to
each ER isoform or a control siRNA were from Santa Cruz.
Apoptosis Assays
For apoptosis studies, TAM-sensitive or resistant cells were subjected to TAM ± other
chemicals or steroids, sometimes following siRNA transfection with 2.5 µg each of siRNAs
using OLIGOfectamine. Experiments were carried out at 48 hours. Apoptosis was

MTT assay
Cell viability was quantified by a kit that measures mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in
viable cells, based on conversion of MTT to MTT–formazan by mitochondrial enzyme. In
brief, MCF7 BK and BK-TR cells were exposed to treatments for up to 72 hours, then
incubated with medium containing MTT 1 mg/ml for 4 h at 37 °C. MTT/formazan was
extracted overnight at 37 °C with 100 µl extraction buffer. Optical densities at 570 nm were
measured.
Cell fraction isolation

Author Manuscript

Mitochondria were isolated from 70% percent confluent cells, collected by gentle scraping,
then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cells as we described 11,53. Cells were
homogenized using the pestle of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer until about 90% of the
cells were broken, pellets suspended in buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and DNAase and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and layered onto a discontinues sucrose gradient (1.0–2.5
M). Cytosolic fractions were centrifuged at 100,000×g for 1 hour to obtain membrane
fractions The mitochondria were suspended in PBS and protein concentration determined
(BCA method).
ER detection in cells

Author Manuscript

MCF7 cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with
0.2% triton-X, then incubated with antibodies to ERα or ERβ used at 1/50 dilution overnight
at 4°C. ER antibodies pre-absorbed with purified ERα or ERβ protein were used as
additional negative controls and IgG antibody produced no staining. FITC (Green)conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector lab Inc.) were added at 1/500 dilution and 2 hours
at room temperature for fluorescent visualization. Western blot of cell fractions was
previously described 10,18.
Mitochondrial cytochrome C release and membrane potential

Author Manuscript

MCF7 BK and BK-TR cells were transfected with control or ER isoform siRNAs and the
mitochondria isolated. Mitochondrial protein was normalized and the organelles were placed
in DMEM and exposed to 5 µM TAM ± 10 µM Mito-Q or SP600125 for 4 hours.
Mitochondria were processed for Western blotting of cytochrome C, released into
incubation media (supernatant) and remaining in mitochondria. In other experiments, MCF7
BK cells were transfected with one of four siRNAs (control, ERα, ERβ, PKCδ or PKCβ), the
cells recovered, then exposed to TAM ± E2 for 4 hours. Cytosol was isolated for Western
Blot of cytochrome C after SDS-PAGE separation of proteins. Mitochondrial membrane
potentials were measured by the Apo Alert mitochondrial membrane kit (Clontech
Laboratories) as we described10.

ROS formation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cultured cells were loaded with 10 µM 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (CMH2DCFDA, Molecular Probes) for 1 h prior to TAM ± other chemical including Rotenone,
2.5 µM, or steroid incubation. After oxidation by ROS, CM-H2DCF is converted to greenfluorescing dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Mitochondrial superoxide generation was detected
by using a specific mitochondrial superoxide indicator, MitoSOX red (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA). MitoSOX red is a cell-permeative dye that reacts with superoxide for
fluorescence upon binding to mitochondrial DNA. Cells grown on specialized coverslips
were loaded in the dark with MitoSOX red (5 µM; 10 min at 37°C) then exposed to TAM.
At 6 hours, cells were washed with PBS and superoxide was quantified in a NovaStar
spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelengths, 396 and 510 nm, emission measured at 580
nm). Values were fold increase in fluorescence from TAM exposure over control cells. In
addition, cells were grown on glass coverslips and observed using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon Eclipse 800) with rhodamine filter, then photographed. Most studies
were carried out three times, and the mean and SEMs were analyzed by ANOVA plus
Schefe's test at a p<0.05 level.
Bax Dimerization and translocation
MCF7 BK cells at near confluency were synchronized, then subjected to TAM ± E2,
Rottlerin, or SP600125 for 6 hours except control cultures.
Mitochondria and the remaining cytoplasm were then isolated for Bax localization as we
described10.
PKC and JNK activity

Author Manuscript

PKCδ activity at 10 minutes incubation was determined as phosphorylation of the protein
isoform at the active site with antibodies to tyrosine 311 or total PKCδ protein. PKC isoform
kinase activity against peptide substrate was also determined10. JNK activity (15 minutes
incubation) was determined similarly by in-vitro assay using c-Jun protein as substrate.54
Interfering RNA to PKC and MnSOD studies
MCF7 BK or BK-TR cells were transfected with 2.5 µg each of the siRNAs and immunoblots for the proteins were carried out 24–48 hours after transfection as we described.50
Manganese superoxide dismutase activity assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were incubated with TAM for 4 hours, sometimes following siRNA transfections 48
hours earlier. MnSOD activities were determined using a superoxide dismutase activity
assay kit (Cayman Chemical) as we described10. Results from 3 experiments were combined
and reported as mean absorption ± standard error.
MnSOD nitration
For MnSOD nitration immuno-blots, cells were incubated with Tam ± E2 or DPN for 2
hours and washed with PBS and suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris + HCl, pH 7.4).
Anti-MnSOD monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) at 2 µg/ml was preincubated with 25 µl of

protein A sepharose (Sigma Chemical) for 3 h. Cell lysates were normalized for protein and
500 µg in 300 µl Chaps buffer per condition were added to MnSOD antibody/sepharose
beads at 4°C overnight, then eluted with sample buffer for Western blotting. Specific
primary antibody to nitrotyrosine (Abcam) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody allowed immuno-blot visualization with the ECL detection system (Amersham).
Nitric Oxide
Nitric oxide synthase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [3H]Larginine to [3H]citrulline in whole cells. Cells were cultured for 5 min and the conversion of
labeled arginine to citrulline was stopped with experimental medium containing unlabeled
L-arginine, 4 mM EDTA, and 1 mM Lcitrulline.

Author Manuscript

The cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris buffer/EDTA and homogenized by a Dounce
homogenizer. Nuclear pellets from the homogenates were obtained by centrifugation at 1000
g for 10 min. Supernatants were layered onto a sucrose gradient producing a top layer
(cytosol) and a mitochondrial layer at the sucrose gradient interface. Mitochondrial fractions
were sonicated and 1ml aliquots from cytosol or mitochondria were added to a slurry (1:1)
of Dowex AG5OWX8 (Bio-Rad), vortexed, and applied to an Econo column (Bio-Rad.
Effluents from washings were mixed with 15 ml scintillation fluid and counted.
In-Vivo Studies

The VA Medical Center, Long Beach Animal Care and Use Committee approved all
procedures. 6-week old athymic (nu/nu) female mice received an E2 pellet under the skin for
6 days (3 days prior to cell injection) then removed, and a 90-day release Tamoxifen pellet
(Innovative Research of America) was inserted. MCF7-BK-TR cells (log phase) in 200 µl of
cells in PBS/growth factor poor matrigel (50/50, 5×106 cells) were injected subcutaneously
into each flank. Tumor size was measured with caliper weekly. At 5 weeks, lentiviral control
shRNA or lentiviral MnSOD shRNA (~5×107 virus, MOI=10) was injected for 2 days into
either left or right flank tumors (400 µl total volume). At 8 weeks, the mice were sacrificed
and tumors harvested. Tumors were divided, one portion fixed in RNA later and the other
stored in liquid nitrogen. Modeling de novo resistance, BK-TR cells were suspended.in
(50/50)PBS/matrigel with control or MnSOD lentiviral shRNA(s) (5×106 cells/200 µl and
virus, MOI=10), injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6 female mice. Tumors were
grown for 5 weeks under TAM pellet conditions, and Annexin V and caspase-7 cleavage
was determined. Fixed tumors were paraffin embedded, cut in 5-um sections, and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. For immuno-staining, tissue sections were deparaffinized,
dehydrated, antigen retrieved, and incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min.
Nonspecific staining was blocked using normal serum (1:50 dilution), then incubation
overnight occurred at 4°C with primary antibodies against Annexin V (goat polyclonal IgG;
Santa Cruz). A brown positive reaction was visualized after incubating the slides with 3,3–
diaminobenzidine for 5 min. Apoptotic cells were counted under the microscope. MnSOD
knockdown was determined by immuno-blot. Caspase-7 was determined from frozen
tumors, pulverized by mortar and pestle, and the proteins extracted with buffer containing
protease inhibitors (Sigma). Proteins were homogenized by polytron, the solution
centrifuged at 14000×G for 10 minutes. Proteins were separated by 10% SDSPAGE,

detect endogenous un-cleaved and 30 and 20 kDa fragments of this caspase.
Statistical Analysis
Most in-vitro studies were carried out three times, and the mean and SEMs were analyzed
by ANOVA plus Schefe's test at a p<0.05 level of significance. In-vivo studies were carried
out in 6 mice and analyzed as noted.

Results
Tamoxifen differentially induces ROS formation and apoptosis in BK and BK-TR cells

Author Manuscript

TAM induces apoptotic cell death in many cells.3–5 In breast cancer, this action could be
mediated through large amounts of ROS as induced by numerous tumor cell stressors.12–14
We first found that the SERM induced a significant increase in ROS generation in MCF7BK cells relative to control (Figure 1a). This occurred from TAM engaging ER as an
antagonist, since TAM's effect was significantly reversed by the ER agonist, 17-β-estradiol
(E2). In contrast, TAM did not stimulate ROS formation in BK-TR cells, or HCC-1569 cells
(ERα and β null), the latter indicating TAM regulates ROS via engaging ER.

Author Manuscript

In BK cells, TAM induced a 16-fold increase in apoptosis compared to unexposed(control)
cells, significantly reversed by E2 (Figure 1b), and in a concentration-related fashion
(Supplemental Figures S1a and S1b). We incubated the cells with 5 µM TAM for many
experiments, a concentration that is 1–2 logs less potent than the equivalent of 4-OH TAM
that is often used for in vitro studies. No cell death occurred in either BK-TR or HCC-1569
cells exposed to the SERM. ROS generation in normal epithelial cells occurs mainly as a
byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation that generates ATP.15 We therefore pretreated BK
cells with specific inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I (Rotenone) and III
(Mito-Q) prior to TAM exposure. Rotenone can induce or inhibit ROS formation,16 but in
MCF7 cell culture rotenone inhibits ROS formation.10 The Mito-Q compound is a
mitochondrial-targeted derivative of ubiquinone that reduces ROS formation by inhibiting
complex III.17

Author Manuscript

Each inhibitor significantly impaired TAM-generated ROS in BK cells, together reducing
ROS by 68% (Figure 1c). The majority of ROS was generated by complex III, as inhibited
by Mito-Q, and rotenone and Mito-Q each significantly prevented TAM-induced cell death
particularly when combined (Figure 1d). Also, E2 as a receptor agonist reversed both TAMgenerated ROS and cell death in BK cells (Figures 1a–d). Thus TAM differentially regulates
ROS levels in BK and BK-TR cells underlying cell fate responses. To further support the
idea that the majority of ROS originate from mitochondria, we measured total ROS and
superoxide levels in BK cells. TAM generated a 4-fold increase in total cellular ROS over
control that was substantially inhibited by concomitant Mito-Q or E2 (Figure 1e, left). In the
same experiments, TAM stimulated a 3-fold increase specifically in superoxide generation
as detected by the Mito-SOX dye, again substantially inhibited by Mito-Q or the sex steroid.
These data indicate that the majority of ROS including superoxide originated from the
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes.

ERβ mediates TAM-induced ROS generation and cell death

Author Manuscript

We determined the ER isoform involved by knocking down ERα and ERβ in BK and BKTR cells with specific siRNAs, as previously described 10,18 and shown in Supplemental
Figure S2. ERα siRNA had a modest effect on ROS levels and apoptosis induced by TAM
in BK cells (Figure 2a). In contrast, ERβ knockdown substantially reversed ROS abundance
and cell death in these cells. ROS generation and apoptotic cell death caused by TAM also
were antagonized to a much greater extent by 10 nM di-propylnitrile (DPN) (ERβ specific
agonist) compared to equimolar propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT) (ERα specific agonist)19
(Figure 2b).

Author Manuscript

These results were confirmed by a second assay, MTT, where TAM induced a progressive
loss of viability over three days in BK cells, but promoted the viability of BK-TR cells
(Figure 2c). Also, at 48 hours, TAM-enhanced cell viability was significantly prevented only
by ERβ but not by ERα siRNA(s) in BK-TR cells (Figure 2d, left). By contrast, TAMinduced loss of viability in BK cells was inhibited by concomitant E2 (Figure 2d, right).
However, in BK-TR cells, E2 or TAM comparably improved cell viability, indicating TAM
functions here as an agonist.
We carried out similar studies in T47D breast cancer cells sensitive or resistant to TAM.20
TAM-sensitive cells responded with increased ROS production and apoptosis mediated
through ERβ but TAM-resistant T47D cells failed to undergo apoptosis to TAM
(Supplemental Figure S2).
Distribution of ERα and ERβ in MCF7-BK and BK-TR cells

Author Manuscript

To further support which ER isoforms and cell pools mediate apoptotic effects, we
determined the distribution of ERα and ERβ in MCF7-BK and BK-TR cells. From immunofluorescence and Western blot studies, endogenous ERβ is found to be mainly peri-nuclear/
mitochondrial (Figures 3a and 3b) but also is present to a lesser extent in nucleus and plasma
membrane, comparably in both BK and BK-TR cells. We previously found that in wild type
MCF7 cells, ERβ extensively co-localizes with the mitochondrial dye, Mitotracker, and
mitochondria are mainly peri-nuclear.10 Thus our finding that ERβ is engaged by TAM as an
antagonist to generate mitochondrial-derived ROS that causes apoptosis in BK cells is
supported by the localization of this receptor isoform to the mitochondria. However, the
differential cell fate response to TAM is unlikely to be due to a large difference in
mitochondrial ERβ in the two cell types.

Author Manuscript

In contrast, ERα is predominantly extra-nuclear/mitochondrial in BK-TR cells (arrows) but
mainly nuclear in BK cells. Since ERα does not appear to be important for the differential
cell fate response to TAM, we do not believe these results are important in this regard. We
previously validated ER antibody specificity in cells11. Here, we first immuno-precipitated
ERα or ERβ from whole cell lysates with the appropriate antibody, then carried out
immuno-blots (IB) with each ER isoform antibody (Figure 3b). These results validated that
each ER isoform antibody was specific. We also immuno-blotted the cell fractions with
antibodies to Tom 20 (mitochondrial), NTF2 (nuclear) and 5'NT (membrane) proteins, as we
previously published to establish the purity of cell fractions from MCF7 and other cells.10,11

TAM regulates MnSOD activity that modulates cell fate

Author Manuscript

Oxidative stress stimulates mitochondrial ROS production21 but several scavenger enzymes
prevent cell damage and apoptosis. Especially important is MnSOD that exists exclusively
in mitochondria and rapidly reduces superoxide to hydrogen peroxide.22 Genetic deletion of
MnSOD in mice is early post-natal lethal,23 indicating ROS quenching by this oxidant
scavenger is probably essential. E2 rapidly activates MnSOD activity and prevents
radiation-induced cell death in MCF7 cells10 and therefore we postulated that the differential
regulation of this enzyme's activity by TAM regulates ROS levels that dictate cell fate.

Author Manuscript

MnSOD activity was significantly reduced in BK cells but increased in BK-TR cells at 2
hours of exposure to TAM (Figure 4a) and was consistent with the different levels of ROS
found in the respective cells. Furthermore, TAM-induced inhibition of MnSOD activity in
BK cells would be predicted to increase superoxide levels, as we demonstrated in Figure 1e.
MnSOD activity regulation depended upon ERβ and the protein levels of MnSOD were not
affected (Figure 4a). We therefore determined how TAM differentially regulates MnSOD
activity. The peroxynitrite ROS inactivates MnSOD by nitrosylating tyrosine 34.24,25 TAM
stimulated the overall tyrosine nitration of endogenous MnSOD in BK cells but inhibited
tyrosine nitration in BK-TR cells, consistent with the differential effects on enzyme activity
(Figure 4b). Interestingly, E2 and the ERβ agonist DPN inhibited TAM-stimulated MnSOD
nitration in BK cells, indicating TAM acts as an ERβ antagonist. In BK-TR cells, the
estrogenic compounds acted like TAM and reduced the control MnSOD nitration, consistent
with TAM engaging ERβ as agonist.

Author Manuscript

To implicate tyrosine 34 nitration in the differential effects of TAM on MnSOD activity, we
expressed Flag-tagged, human wild type (WT) or Y34F MnSOD: the latter is a mutant that
abrogates nitration at this regulatory site. TAM suppressed Flag-WT MnSOD activity in
BK-transfected cells but stimulated activity in BK-TR cells (Figure 4c), similar to
endogenous MnSOD regulation (Figure 4a). Importantly, TAM failed to significantly
modulate the basal activity of the Y34F mutant enzyme in either cell. Additionally, TAM
stimulated the overall tyrosine nitration of Flag-WT MnSOD in BK cells and suppressed
nitration in BK-TR cells (Figure 4d). In these two cells, nitration inversely correlated to the
differential regulation by TAM of endogenous or expressed WT MnSOD activities (Figures
4a and 4c) and ROS levels (Figure 1). By contrast, TAM did not modulate the overall
nitration of Y34F MnSOD in either cell type. These results implicate tyrosine 34 as the
specific target for differential nitration and regulation of MnSOD activity by TAM.

Author Manuscript

To link enhanced MnSOD activity to TAM resistance, we knocked down this enzyme with
siRNA as previously validated in MCF7 cells.10 MCF7 BK-TR cells expressing control
siRNA and exposed to TAM showed few cells undergoing apoptotic cell death (Figure 5a).
In contrast, MnSOD knockdown caused a 15-fold increase in apoptosis but only in the
presence of TAM. We then further investigated how TAM modulates MnSOD nitrosylation.
Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits cytochrome oxidase in respiratory complexes, increasing
peroxynitrite generation that nitrosylates tyrosine 34 of MnSOD.25 TAM stimulated NO
formation only in the mitochondria but not the cytoplasm of BK cells and reduced NO
formation in BK-TR cell mitochondria (Figure 5b). The inhibitor of mitochondrial Complex

III, Mito Q, prevented the differential regulation of NO by TAM, indicating Complex III is
involved in modulating NO levels/generation.
By using an NO inhibitor, L-NMMA, we found that TAM caused an NO dependent
nitrosylation of expressed WT MnSOD in BK cells (Figure 5c, lanes 3 versus 5), correlating
to decreased MnSOD activity (Figures 4a and 4c). TAM or NO did not affect Y34F MnSOD
nitrosylation in BK cells. In BK-TR cells, basal nitrosylation of WT but not Y34F MnSOD
was strong and TAM substantially inhibited only WT enzyme nitrosylation (Figure 5c, lanes
1 versus 3). The results in BK-TR cells correlate to increased MnSOD activity, and LNMMA had no effect when added with TAM. Thus, in BK-TR cells, TAM stimulates
MnSOD activity by inhibiting NO generation and its target nitrosylation of tyrosine 34. This
leads to reduced ROS and cell survival.

Author Manuscript

Mediators of ROS-induced cell death
In BK cells, TAM induced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane permeability that
correlated to stimulating the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Supplemental
Figure S4). We therefore sought to identify targets of ROS that mediated engagement of this
pathway.
Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) is implicated in mitochondrial-related cell death, and the
hydrogen peroxide ROS promotes PKCδ translocation to the organelle to modify proapoptotic BCL-2 family activities.26,27 Additionally, c-Jun, N-terminal kinase (JNK)
contributes to apoptosis in breast cancer cells.28,29 We found that TAM stimulated both JNK
and PKCδ activities in BK but not BK-TR cells, and through mitochondrial ROS since
Mito-Q reversed these actions (Figures 6a and b).

Author Manuscript

A possible target of this signaling is the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In response to death
stimuli, Bax translocates to the mitochondria, undergoes dimerization/activation, and inserts
into the outer mitochondrial membrane.30,31 This promotes cytochrome C release into the
cytoplasm, stimulating. apoptosome formation.32 Under our control conditions, Bax exists
predominantly as a monomer in the cytosol of the TAM-sensitive BK cells (Figure 6c, lanes
1).
TAM caused both the translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial cell fraction and
dimerization of this protein (lanes 2) but Rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor) and SP 600125 (JNK1
inhibitor) significantly prevented both actions (Figure 6c, lanes 2–4). Thus, mtROS-induced
kinase activation likely results in BAX participating in the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
apoptosis pathway in these cells.

Author Manuscript

To link PKC to apoptosome formation, we used siRNAs as previously validated.10
Specifically, PKCδ knockdown significantly prevented TAM-induced cytochrome C release
into the cytoplasm of BK cells and this action of TAM also depended upon JNK activity
(Figure 6d).
At what sub-cellular site does TAM act since ERβ is predominantly in mitochondria (Figure
3)? BK and BK-TR cells were transfected with ERα, ERβ, or control siRNAs, the cells

recovered, and mitochondria were isolated and placed into culture. TAM caused secretion of
cytochrome C protein from isolated BK mitochondria into the culture media (supernatant)
(Figure 6e, left 2 panels), inhibited by only ERβ siRNA. Mito-Q also substantially reversed
cytochrome C secretion from BK mitochondria linking TAM-generated ROS in this
organelle. In contrast, there were no effects from any treatment on BK-TR cells. (Figure 6e,
right 2 panels).
MnSOD serves as an in-vivo target to restore TAM sensitivity

Author Manuscript

Tamoxifen resistance in women develops after initial tumor response of varying duration or
as a primary/de novo event and we modeled both situations in-vivo. At two separate flank
sites, BK-TR cells were injected into mice where 90-day, Tam release pellets were inserted
and the tumor cells were grown for 8 weeks. At week 5, comparable size tumors were seen
in each flank (Figure 7a) and either control or MnSOD lentiviral shRNAs were injected into
the palpable tumors on each of 2 successive days. The lentiviral shRNA(s) were first
evaluated in cultured BK-TR cells, and the MnSOD shRNA induced substantial apoptosis
only in the presence of TAM (Supplemental Figure S5).

Author Manuscript

Tumors injected with lentiviral control shRNA showed continued growth at 8 weeks (1690 ±
146 (SEM) mm3)(Fig. 7a). In contrast, lentiviral MnSOD shRNA resulted in substantial
tumor regression (480 ± 62 mm3), compared both to 5 weeks growth and to control shRNAinjected tumors at 8 weeks (*p<0.05, n=6) (Figure 7a). The removed tumors showed
significantly different weights (Figure 7b), expression of MnSOD protein (Figure 7c),
staining for Annexin V (Figure 7d), and cleaved caspase-7 (Figure 7e). Thus in-vivo TAM
resistance can be reversed by inhibiting MnSOD, restoring a significant apoptotic response
in mature tumors. We also injected BK-TR cells in matrigel into both flanks of nude mice,
one site co-injected with lentiviral control shRNA and the other with lentiviral MnSOD
shRNA. Control shRNA tumor cells rapidly grew into palpable tumors while MnSOD
shRNA tumors very slowly progressed over 5 weeks (Supplemental Figures S6a). MnSOD
protein was significantly reduced by the lentiviral shRNA against this protein, tumor
weights and size were significantly diminished, and Annexin V expression and caspase-7
cleavage were demonstrated only in MnSOD shRNA tumors (Supplemental Figures S6b–d).
We believe that the incomplete knockdown of MnSOD in some tumor cells allowed
expansion into the small tumors seen at 5 weeks.

In breast cancer, adjuvant therapies generate large amounts of ROS that cause oxidative
damage and induce apoptosis.33 By contrast, moderate ROS formation is often required for
rapid signaling by growth factor receptors 21,34 including estrogen actions in breast cancer.35
Also, mitochondrial gene mutations that result in moderate ROS levels promote cancer
development.36,37 Thus, the tight regulation of ROS underlies cancer fate.
TAM resistance may arise from several mechanisms. One mechanism is that increased
membrane ERα and the resulting rapid signaling promotes TAM resistance 7, 38.
Interestingly, we found enhanced expression of ERα at the membrane of the BK-TR cells
and not in BK cells. However, ERα does not seem to play a role in the adjuvant resistance of

BK-TR cells investigated here. From our models, TAM acts in sensitive breast cancer cells
as an ERβ antagonist increasing mitochondrial ROS concentration due to diminished
MnSOD activity, and activating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Although TAM also has
cytostatic properties, cytotoxicity is an important mechanism in the effectiveness of this
SERM. 3,29 Resistance to TAM occurs from the SERM acting as an ERβ agonist, upregulating MnSOD activity that diminishes ROS to result in cell survival and growth.
Although we don't know why cancer cells become TAM resistant or why TAM engages ERβ
as an agonist in this setting, we have uncovered a mechanism that differentiates sensitivity
versus resistance and a potential target to reverse the latter. Importantly, knocking down
MnSOD impressively changed BK-TR SERM resistance to sensitivity, resulting in a 15-fold
increase in TAM induced apoptotic cell death. High MnSOD expression in ER-positive
breast tumors was identified as a significant negative prognostic factor for patient survival,
associated with the development of distant metastases.39 Insufficient numbers of recurring
tumors however did not allow analysis of contributing factors.
In many cell types including breast cancer, others and we have localized a significant
expression of endogenous ERβ to mitochondria10,40–42 where in several models, ERβ
mediates cell survival.10,43,44 However, the role of ERβ in breast cancer is unclear. In
women with this malignancy, ERβ is expressed at relatively low amounts but correlates to
TAM resistance45 and the cytoplasmic expression of the endogenous ERβ2 isoform
correlates to poor prognosis from this cancer.46

In sensitive cells, TAM caused substantial cell death through mtROS dependent kinase
activation that induced the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis program. Importantly, TAM
directly stimulated the release of cytochrome C from isolated mitochondria of sensitive but
not resistant cells in both ERβ and ROS dependent fashions. Decreased ROS abundance in
TAM-resistant cells resulted primarily from ROS quenching by enhanced MnSOD activity.

We provide the novel insight that TAM differentially regulates MnSOD nitration at tyrosine
34 and hence enzyme activity in BK versus BK-TR cells through the differential generation
of NO in mitochondria. TAM/ERβ was found to activate a mitochondrial NO synthase
(blocked by L-NAMME) to produce NO that is known to inhibit cytochrome oxidase in
respiratory complexes, increasing peroxynitrite generation that nitrosylates tyrosine 34 of
MnSOD.47 TAM stimulated NO formation only in the mitochondria of BK cells and
reduced NO formation in BKTR cell mitochondria. The inhibitor of mitochondrial Complex
III, Mito Q, prevented the differential regulation of NO by TAM, indicating that Complex
III is likely also involved in TAM modulating NO levels/generation in some way. In mice,
genetic deletion of MnSOD leads to neonatal death due to cell apoptosis.48 Thus, other
oxidant scavenging proteins can't fully compensate for the loss of MnSOD, establishing its
importance.
Recent studies have linked lysine 122 acetylation of MnSOD to the downregulation of
enzyme activity.49 Sirtuin 3 is a de-acetylase that is mainly mitochondrial in location and
prevents lysine122 acetylation that results from radiation and other stresses. As a result,
sirtuin 3 maintains MnSOD activity to reduce superoxide levels and genomic stress.
Interestingly, female sirtuin 3 knockout mice develop ERα and progesterone receptor

positive mammary tumors, correlating to the reduced sirtuin 3 levels described in human
breast cancer.50 Whether mitochondrial ERβ in breast tumor epithelial cells affects sirtuin 3
expression and function is unknown.

We found that TAM resistant tumors significantly grew in-vivo in the presence of this
SERM but underwent substantial regression/apoptosis upon MnSOD knockdown. As shown
in-vitro, TAM exposure was required for extensive cell death of MnSOD knockdown cells.
This model indicates a possible target to reestablish sensitivity in women whose tumors
were initially inhibited by TAM but subsequently acquired resistance. We also found that
our model of de novo TAM resistant tumor development was substantially prevented by
MnSOD knockdown. This is not accomplished by deleting ERβ since TAM-induced
mitochondrial ROS generation and cell death requires engaging this steroid receptor, as seen
in sensitive cells. Rather we inhibited the downstream mediator of TAM-resistance,
MnSOD, to allow sufficient ROS levels to cause apoptotic cell death. Recently reported,
cancer stem cells produce lower levels of ROS than non-tumor initiating, transformed
epithelial cells, attributed to increased expression of ROS scavenging systems that also
confer radiation resistance.51 Thus augmenting ROS levels may be important in several
therapeutic contexts.
In summary, down-regulating mitochondrial MnSOD in ER positive breast cancers may
prevent and reverse tumor resistance to adjuvant TAM therapy. The results also support
developing a selective ERβ antagonist and delivering this reagent into breast tumors to
stimulate the important cytotoxic mechanisms delineated here, perhaps providing
therapeutic benefit.
