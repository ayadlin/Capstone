ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains lack of effective
chemotherapeutic drugs, therefore, discovering novel anti-HCC drugs is a very
attractive and urgent task. In this study, we reported VOSL (volatile oil from
Saussurea lappa root) exhibits potent therapeutic effect on SMMC-7721 xenografts
without obvious side effects. In the in vitro experiments, VOSL inhibited HCC cell
proliferation by arresting cell cycle at S and G2/M phases, and induced HCC cell
apoptosis by activating the Caspase3 pathway. VOSL also decreased the capability of
HCC cell migration and invasion through MMP-9 depression. Moreover, mechanistic
study indicated that VOSL can act as an epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitor to suppress EGFR activation and then to suppress its downstream MEK/P38
and PI3-K/Akt pathways. These results suggested that VOSL may be a novel antiHCC drug candidate.

approved anticancer drugs are plant-derived agents,
including some well-known chemotherapeutic agents,
such as vinblastine, etoposide, paclitaxel, topotecan
[8, 10].
The root of Saussurea lappa, has been used in the
treatment of cancer for thousands of years in China. It
includes a variety of bioactive ingredients like volatile oil,
sterols, alkaloids, organic acids and so on. Our previous
studies demonstrated that the volatile oil from Saussurea
lappa root (VOSL), sesquiterpene lactones-rich fraction,
contains the most important anti-cancer constituents [9].
Thereinto, costunolide (Cos) and dehydrocostuslactone
(Dehy) are the main natural sesquiterpene lactones in
VOSL, account for about 75% by weight. Numerous
researches reported that these two compounds exhibited
potential anti-cancer activities towards various types of
cancer, including leukemia, bladder cancer, breast cancer,
prostatic cancer, and so on [10]. Cos and Dehy have anti-

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a most
malignant cancer which generally arises from various
kinds of chronic liver diseases [1–3]. The five year
survival rate of HCC patients after surgery is only about
20%-30%. Frequent recurrence, metastasis and multi-drug
resistance are the main reasons for the high mortality rate
of HCC [4, 5]. Up to now, sorafenib is the only effective
target chemotherapeutic agent for late-stage HCC patients,
however, its therapeutic effect is still rather disappointing.
Therefore, to discovernovel drugs is an urgent work for
the treatment of HCC.
During a long time, natural products have been
served as important sources of novel lead structures for
discovery of anticancer agents as their diverse ‘drug-like’
structure and ‘biologically friendly’ molecular qualities
[6–9]. According to a recent analysis, at least 73 clinically

hepatitis B virus activity, which is very important for
prevention of liver cancer [11]. Therefore, we thought
that VOSL and its main bioactive constituents, Cos and
Dehy, may be potential drug candidates for prevention and
treatment of HCC.
Our previous study also revealed that Cos and Dehy
exhibited synergistic anti-cancer effect in vivo. VOSL
showed stronger inhibition effects on human breast cancer
MCF-7 xenografts than Cos or Dehy alone. Moreover,
VOSL not only inhibited the growth of tumors, but also
maintained weight and vitality of tumor-burdened nude
mice, which is a great significance to “tumor-burdened
survival” [12]. However, the synergistic anti-tumor
mechanism of VOSL remains vague. Therefore, we
investigated the anti-HCC efficiency and molecular
mechanisms of VOSL in order to promote its pre-clinical
research, which may offer a novel chemotherapeutic agent
for HCC prevention and treatment.

phase increase combined with G0/G1 depletion. Moreover,
Cos changed Hep3B cell cycle progression by increasing S
phase and decreasing G0/G1 and G2/M phases. However,
VOSL, C+2D and Dehy changed Hep3B cell cycle
progression by increasing S and G2/M phases combined
with decreasing G0/G1 phase (Figure 2C and Table 1).

VOSL induces HCC cell apoptosis
Hoechst analysis revealed that cell nuclei of HCC
cells in the tested groups experienced a stronger blue
fluorescence than those in the control group, which meant
that VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy treatment can induce
apoptosis of SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells accompanied
with nucleus condensation (Figure 3A).
Annexin V-FITC/PI staining showed that VOSL,
C+2D, Cos, and Dehy treatments led to a dramatic increase
of apoptotic ratio in both SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells (Figure 3B and 3C; Supplementary Figure S2).
Active Caspase3 is the primary markers of cells undergo
apoptosis. Cleaved-Caspase3 and Caspase3 were measured
by Western blot at 48 h later after treatment. The results
showed VOSL, C+2D and Dehy treatments up-regulated
the expression of cleaved-Caspase3 and down-regulated
the expression of Caspase3 in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells. However, the expression of Caspase3 and cleavedCaspase3 in the Cos-treated group had no obvious changes
compared with the control group, which meant that the
apoptotic induction mechanism of Cos on HCC cells may
be different from VOSL, C+2D and Dehy (Figure 3D).

RESULTS
VOSL suppresses HCC cell proliferation and
HCC xenograft growth
VOSL, Cos and Dehy were obtained from the dry
roots of Saussurea lappa through a bioactivity-oriented
screening platform in previous study (Figure 1A) [9].
MTT assay showed that SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells
were more sensitive to these compounds. Simultaneously,
the inhibitory rate of VOSL on normal liver cells,
especially WRL-68 cells, was the lowest, which revealed
the relatively weak toxicity on normal cells (Figure 1B).
SMMC-7721 xenografts in nude mice were used
to evaluate the anti-HCC effects of VOSL and its active
ingredients, and the results demonstrated that VOSL
revealed the best anti-HCC activity among five test groups
(Figure 1C, 1D and 1E). The inhibitory rates of VOSL,
5-Fu, C+2D, Dehy, and Cos on SMMC-7721 xenografts
are 55.71%, 42.22%, 37.51%, 30.23%, and 23.15%,
respectively, after intraperitoneal injections for 24 times.

VOSL inhibits the capbility of HCC cell motility
The majority of HCC patients die of tumor
recurrence and metastasis, therefore, inhibiting the
capbility of HCC cell motility is an attractive strategy
for its treatment [10]. We examined the possible effects
of VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy on HCC cell migration
and invasion through wound healing and Transwell assay.
The results indicated that VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy, at
low concentrations that did not notably reduce the viability
of HCC cells, dose-dependently reduced the capabilities
of HCC cell migration and invasion when compared
with the untreated group (Figure 4A-4D; Supplementary
Figure S3 and S4). Moreover, MMP-9, a major member of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), was measured through
Western blot, the results showed that its expression was
significantly reduced in both SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells after treatment (Figure 4E).

VOSL inhibits clone formation of HCC and
modulates cell cycle progression
To investigate the long-term cytotoxicity of VOSL
and its active ingredients on HCC cells, cell clone
formation assay was carried out on SMMC-7721 and
Hep3B cells. The results revealed that VOSL, C+2D,
Cos and Dehy dose-dependently inhibited the clone
formation of SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells (Figure 2A
and 2B; Supplementary Figure S1). The uncontrolled
cell cycle progression is one of the hallmarks of cancer,
therefore, agents targeting this process may be potential
chemopreventive drugs [10]. Our results demonstrated
that VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy dose-dependently
modulated SMMC-7721 cell cycle progression through S

VOSL inhibits EGFR activation in HCC cells
Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated
kinases (ERK), the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and
the p38 MAPKs plays an important part in regulating
of cancer cell biological characteristics [14, 15]. PI3-K/
Akt signaling is widely involved in controlling the

proliferation, survival or death of cancer cells [16].
Therefore, the effects of VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy
on MAPK and Akt activation were examined. MEK/P38
cascade activation in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells was
dose-dependently suppressed by VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and
Dehy, but they had no effect on the activation of ERK.
Meanwhile, VOSL, C+2D, and Dehy dose-dependently
decreased p-Akt levels in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells,
however, the p-Akt level had no obvious changes in the
Cos-treated group (Figure 5A).
Since MEK/P38 and PI3-K/Akt is the primary
downstream cascades of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
meanwhile, EGFR is the most important RTK in cancer
cells [17, 18]. Therefore, we speculated that VOSL may
act as an EGFR inhibitor to suppress EGFR activation.
In order to validate this speculation, we determined the
EGFR activation in the control group and the treatment
groups. The results revealed that the phosphorylated
EGFR (p-EGFR) levels in HCC cells were significantly

suppressed after VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy treatments
(Figure 5B).

VOSL suppresses RTKs-mediated signaling in
HCC xenografts
The expression of relevant factors and the number
of apoptotic cells in xenograft tumors were detected by
immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively.
VOSL, C+2D, Cos, and Dehy treatments could induce
SMMC-7721 cell apoptosis in xenograft tumors, among
them, VOSL exerted the greatest effect on inducing cell
apoptosis (Figure 6A and 6C). The phosphorylation of Akt
was also blocked by VOSL, C+2D, and Dehy treatments
in the SMMC-7721 xenografts, except the Cos-treated
group (Figure 6A and 6B). Simultaneously, the expression
of Ki67, p-P38 and p-EGFR in all treatment groups was
reduced compared with the control group, and their lowest
expression levels were observed in the VOSL-treated

the two main mechanisms of chemotherapeutic agents
[21]. In this study, VOSL, C+2D, Cos and Dehy markedly
inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells, interfered the progression of cell cycle, and also
triggered apoptosis to inhibit the progress of HCC. The
apoptotic mechanisms in HCC cells induced by Cos may
be partially different from those induced by VOSL, C+2D
or Dehy due to the ratio of cleaved-Caspase3 to Caspase3
was obviously increased in the VOSL, C+2D or Dehytreated groups, but it was no obvious change in the Costreated group. Activation of Caspase 3 is always involved
in the regulation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
pathways, and the activity of P38 has great relationship
with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic

DISCUSSION
HCC is one of the common malignances and has
high mortality due to frequent recurrence, metastasis and
multi-drug resistance [19, 20]. Our study demonstrated
that VOSL, C+2D, Cos and Dehy, acting as EGFR
inhibitors, exhibited anti-HCC activity, and VOSL showed
the best anti-HCC activity among the tested groups.

pathway [10]. In this study, we also found that the
phosphorylation of P38 in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells
was dose-dependently inhibited by VOSL, C+2D, Cos,
and Dehy. Therefore, we suggested that VOSL, C+2D or
Dehy-induced HCC cell apoptosis may adopts at least two

different apoptotic pathways, but Cos-induced HCC cell
apoptosis possibly employs the ER stress pathway.
Numerous studies indicated that Cos and Dehy can
modulate cell cycle progression by activating the P21/
P27 pathway, which lead to cell cycle arrest in S or/and

G2/M phases [22, 23]. In this study, we indeed observed
that VOSL, C+2D, Dehy and Cos induce HCC cell cycle
arrest in S or/and G2/M phases. MMP-9 can degrade some
extracellular matrixs, and the change of MMP-9 expression
is closely related to tumor metastasis and invasion in
various tumors [24–28]. Our results from Scarification
and Transwell assays indicated that VOSL, C+2D, Cos,
and Dehy at low concentrations significantly reduced
the capabilities of HCC cell migration and invasion. In
addition, we observed the down-regulation of MMP-9 level
in the VOSL, C+2D, Cos or Dehy- treated HCC cells.
Accumulating evidence showed that MAPK
activation play a vital role in HCC development [17].
We found that VOSL, C+2D, Cos and Dehy treatments
significantly depressed MEK/P38 cascade activation, but
didn’t influence ERK activation. PI3-K/Akt pathway is
also involved in HCC progression. The activated Akt has

been considered as an indicator for HCC recurrence and
poor prognosis of patients [29]. Our results revealed that
VOSL, C+2D, Cos and Dehy significantly suppressed
the PI3-K/Akt signaling in HCC cells. Taken together,
the simultaneous suppression of MEK/P38 and PI3-K/
Akt signaling always by VOSL represents an attractive
strategy for treating HCC.
RTKs are glycoproteins spanning cell membrane,
which interact with growth factors and in turn cause the
activation of intracellular catalytic domains, whereby
transmit cellular signals [30]. EGFR is the most
important RTK in cancer cells and overexpresses in a
variety of malignancies [31, 32]. It can activate distinct
downstream kinases, and leads to the phosphorylation
of MAPK kinases and Akt [33–36]. Considering VOSL
could simultaneously inhibit MEK/P38 and PI3-K/Akt
signaling, we thought that VOSL may influence EGFR

activation in HCC cells. Interestingly, our data showed
that VOSL, C+2D, Cos and Dehy significantly suppressed
the phosphorylation of EGFR in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells, which confirms our conjecture.
Although both Cos and Dehy are natural
sesquiterpene lactones, their anti-HCC molecular
mechanisms seem to be different. Combination treatment

of these two compounds (C+2D) showed a synergistic antiHCC effect in the SMMC-7721 xenografts. In addition,
we speculated that there should be indirect anti-HCC
compounds besides direct anti-HCC compounds, Cos and
Dehy, in VOSL because VOSL exhibits better anti-HCC
effect than C+2D in vivo. Therefore, VOSL exhibited
the therapy characteristics of multiple-components and

xenografts directly, and other active ingredients in VOSL
may act on nude mice to exert indirectly anti-HCC activity.
Figuring out the indirect anti-HCC ingredients in VOSL
and exploring their associated mechanism will be our topic
of further research. In conclusion, our experiments showed
that VOSL suppressed HCC progression by regulating
EGFR pathway (Figure 7), which could be a useful drug
candidate in HCC therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human HCC cell lines, SMMC-7721, Hep3B,
HepG2, Huh-7, HCC-LM3, and two normal hepatic cell
lines, WRL-68 and L02, were cultured in DMEM with
10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), and
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2.

VOSL was prepared as previously described [9].
Briefly, ten g of Saussurea lappa roots were crushed into
powder, and extracted with 100 mL of hexane for 1h, The
filtrates were evaporated to get VOSL, and then were
analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography
coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Commercial Cos and Dehy
were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biotech CO., Ltd
and its purity is more than 98%. VOSL, Cos and Dehy

The ratio of Cos to Dehy is about 1 to 2 by weight
in VOSL, therefore, in the following experiments, we
generally designed four tested groups, the Cos group,
Dehy group, C+2D (Cos/Dehy=1:2, w/w; simulating the
composition ratio of VOSL) group, and VOSL group, to
treat HCC cells. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay.
0, 5, 10, 15, 20 μg/ml of the tested samples (Cos, Dehy,
C+2D and VOSL) were added in cultured cells. After 48
h incubation, MTT reagent was added to each well, then

the absorbanc at 492 nm was detected and the IC50 value
of every tested sample was calculated using the Trimmed
Spearman-Karber Method [13].

SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells were cultured and
incubated with Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL at IC30 and
IC50 concentrations for 48 h, respectively. The harvested
cells were prepared to extract total protein. The extracted
protein was separated on 8% - 12% SDS-PAGE, then
transferred onto PVDF membrane (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology). The blot was blocked with non-fat milk,
incubated with the primary antibodies (Caspase3, cleavedCaspase3, Akt, p-Akt, P38, p-P38, ERK, p-ERK, EGFR
and p-EGFR) and then with the secondary antibodies.
Signals were developed using ECL reagents (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Shanghai, China). GAPDH was
used as an inner control.

Cell clonogenic and cell cycle assays
To determine long-term effects of Cos, Dehy,
C+2D or VOSL on the proliferation of SMMC-7721
and Hep3B cells, cells were exposed to the tested
samples at IC10, IC30 and IC50 concentrations for
48 h, respectively, and rinsed with fresh medium. The
resulting adherent cells were cultured continuously for
14 days in normal culture condition. Finally, the cells
were fixed and stained with crystal violet for counting
the clone formation.
The distribution of cell cycle was detected by
propidium iodid (PI) staining. SMMC-7721 and Hep3B
cells were treated with Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL at
various concentrations (IC10, IC30 and IC50) for 48 h.
The harvested cells were fixed in alcohol (70%) for 24 h
at 4°C, stained with PI for 30 min, then analyzed with flow
cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

In vivo tumor xenograft study
All procedures involving animals were approved
by the Experimental Animal Ethics and Management
Committee. Male nude mice (4 weeks old; BALB/cnude) were purchased from SLAC Laboratory Animal
Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China). SMMC-7721 cells were injected subcutaneously
into the axillary fossa of nude mice (4×106 cells in 150
μl PBS). Tumors were developed at 10 days after cell
injection. The treatment was started when tumors reached
a size of 2 - 3 mm in diameter. Thirty-six mice were
randomly divided into six groups. The Cos, Dehy, C+2D
and VOSL-treated groups were injected intraperitoneally
at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day, respectively. The positive
and negative control group were administrated with
5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day, and
an equal volume of vehicle, respectively. Tumor size
was monitored every three days, and tumor volume was
calculated using the formula: tumor volume=0.5×a×b2,
where a and b represent the largest and smaller diameters,
respectively.
Tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed after 24 times
of administrations. Tumors were collected and weighed,
and then prepared the consecutive sections for examining
the expression of p-AKT, p-P38, Ki-67 and p-EGFR by
immunohistochemistry. The apoptotic cells in xenograft
tumors were detected by TUNEL (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). The positive cells were
observed under microscope within 5 medium-power fields
at magnification 200×.

Apoptosis analysis
Hoechst was used to determine the morphological
change of apoptotic cells. SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells
were treated with Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL at IC50
concentration for 48 h, and then stained with Hochest
33342 (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 15
min. A fluorescence microscope was used to observe the
morphological change of apoptotic cells.
SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells were treated with
Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL at IC10, IC30 and IC50
concentrations, respectively, for 48 h, and stained with
Annexin V-FITC/PI (Yesen, Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China) for 10 min, and then analyzed by FACS Calibur
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to
calculated the apoptotic ratio of cells.

Migration and invasion activity assays
Scarification test was used to evaluate the migration
of HCC cells. SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells were planted
in 6-well plates and wounds were created with a micropipette tip in the cell monolayer. The cells were exposed
to Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL at IC5, IC10, and IC20
concentrations, respectively, for 48 h, and their migration
distances were measured by Photoshop.
Transwell assay with extracellular matrix (ECM)
was performed to evaluate the influence of Cos, Dehy,
C+2D and VOSL on tumor invasion. SMMC-7721 and
Hep3B were exposed to Cos, Dehy, C+2D or VOSL
at IC5, IC10, and IC20 concentrations for 48 h, and
the infiltrated cells were stained with crystal violet and
statistically analyzed by microscope.

Statistical analysis
The in vitro experimental data were derived from at
least three independent experiments, and the in vivo data
were collected from 6 mice. All data were expressed as
mean±SD, and the significant difference was determined
by using the Student’s t-test. The statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05.
