Abstract
Helicobacter pylori infection and a high dietary salt intake are
risk factors for the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. In
this study, we tested the hypothesis that high salt concentrations might alter gene expression in H. pylori. Transcriptional profiling experiments indicated that the expression of
multiple H. pylori genes, including cagA, was regulated in
response to the concentrations of sodium chloride present
in the bacterial culture medium. Increased expression of cagA
in response to high salt conditions was confirmed by the use
of transcriptional reporter strains and by immunoblotting.
H. pylori CagA is translocated into gastric epithelial cells via a
type IV secretion pathway, and on entry into target cells, CagA
undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and causes multiple
cellular alterations. Coculture of gastric epithelial cells with
H. pylori grown under high salt conditions resulted in
increased tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA and increased secretion of interleukin-8 by the epithelial cells compared with
coculture of the cells with H. pylori grown under low salt
conditions. Up-regulation of H. pylori cagA expression in
response to high salt concentrations may be a factor that
contributes to the development of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Introduction
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that persistently colonizes the human stomach (1, 2). H. pylori elicits a gastric
mucosal inflammatory response, and infection with this organism
is a risk factor for gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease (1, 2).
H. pylori has been classified as a class I carcinogen by the WHO (3).
H. pylori exhibits a high level of intraspecies genetic diversity
(4). Whether symptomatic disease develops in H. pylori–infected
persons is determined in part by characteristics of the H. pylori
strains with which individuals are infected. Some H. pylori strains
contain a 40-kb region of chromosomal DNA known as the cag
pathogenicity island (PAI; refs. 5–7). The risk of gastric cancer or
peptic ulcer disease is higher among persons infected with cagpositive H. pylori strains than among persons infected with cagnegative strains (5–7). The cag PAI encodes a protein, CagA, that
enters gastric epithelial cells, as well as a type IV secretion system
that delivers CagA into host cells (8, 9). Within gastric epithelial
cells, CagA can interact with multiple target molecules and can
cause a wide array of cellular alterations, including changes in the
morphology of gastric epithelial cells, cell scattering, cell prolifer-

ation, alterations of tight junctions, dephosphorylation of cellular
proteins, activation of h-catenin, and activation of the Ras/
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) kinase/ERK pathway (6). Based on these observations, it
has been proposed that CagA functions as a bacterial oncoprotein
(6, 10).
The risk of gastric carcinoma is influenced not only by H. pylori
strain characteristics but also by host genetic determinants and
environmental factors. One of the environmental factors associated
with an increased risk of gastric cancer is high dietary salt intake
(11–13). A link between high salt intake and gastric cancer has
been shown in human epidemiologic studies and also in animal
models (14, 15). The mechanisms by which high salt intake
contributes to the development of gastric carcinoma remain poorly
understood.
Gene expression in several bacterial pathogens, including Vibrio
cholerae, Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes (16, 17), is
regulated in response to salt concentration. In the present study,
we tested whether H. pylori gene expression is altered in response
to changes in salt concentration in the bacterial culture medium.
We report that the expression of numerous H. pylori genes is
regulated in response to sodium chloride concentration. We
describe in detail the effect of salt concentration on the expression
of CagA, a bacterial factor that may contribute to the development
of gastric cancer.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions. Mutant strains were derived
from H. pylori 26695 SC#7, which contains an intact cag PAI (18). H. pylori
strains were grown on trypticase soy agar plates containing 5% sheep blood,
or in sulfite-free Brucella broth medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; i.e., BB-FBS). The previously described sulfite-free Brucella
broth medium (19) was modified by the use of Bacto Proteose peptone
(Becton Dickinson) in place of peptamin. The BB-FBS medium routinely
used for growing H. pylori was prepared by addition of 0.5% NaCl. In the
current study, BB-FBS was supplemented with NaCl concentrations ranging
from 0.25% (43 mmol/L) to 2% (342 mmol/L) NaCl. When appropriate, agarbased culture media were supplemented with kanamycin (10 Ag/mL) or
chloramphenicol (5 Ag/mL). All H. pylori strains were grown at 37jC in
room air supplemented with 5% CO2. Escherichia coli strains were grown
in Luria Bertani (LB) medium or in LB liquid medium supplemented
with ampicillin (50 Ag/mL), kanamycin (25 Ag/mL), or chloramphenicol
(30 Ag/mL), as appropriate.
RNA isolation and array analyses. H. pylori strain 26695 (SC#7) was
grown for 15 h in BB-FBS medium containing 0.5% sodium chloride (i.e.,
BB-FBS-0.5%). The bacterial cells (A 600, 0.4–0.5) were then centrifuged and
resuspended in fresh BB-FBS-0.25% or BB-FBS-1.5% medium at an A 600 of
0.1. The bacteria were grown for 10 h, harvested by centrifugation, and
frozen at 80jC. Extraction of RNA was done using the Trizol method
(Invitrogen), and the extracted RNA was further purified with RNeasy spin
columns (Qiagen). Labeling of RNA with [33P]dATP was carried out with
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously

(20). Each labeled RNA preparation was then hybridized to H. pylori
Panorama arrays (Sigma Genosys) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The H. pylori Panorama arrays contain 1,681 PCR-amplified
open reading frames (ORF), including 1,590 ORFs from H. pylori strain
26695, as well as 91 strain-specific ORFs found in H. pylori strain J99.
Scanning of the hybridized arrays was done with a PhosphorImager (Fuji,
Inc.), and the hybridization signals were quantified with ImageQuant (Fuji)
and Array Vision (Imaging Research, Inc.) software. For each array feature, a
normalized signal intensity was calculated as a ratio of the signal intensity
for the individual array feature divided by the total signal intensity of the
entire array. The results of multiple array experiments were then used to
calculate mean normalized signal intensities for each array feature. Array
data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database,
accession number GSE7183.
Plasmid construction and generation of H. pylori transcriptional
reporter strains. PCR was carried out using Vent DNA Polymerase (NEB).
To construct H. pylori transcriptional reporter strains, target genes of
interest were PCR amplified from H. pylori strain 26695 using the following
forward and reverse primers sets: 5¶-AATCGTTCTAGCCTTTAGACGCC-3¶
and 5¶-CAGGTTCTATGCCATTATGACTCCC-3¶ for cagA (HP0547); 5¶-GCCCTCATCGCCCACGCTTTCCCC-3¶ and 5¶-TGCGGGTATGGGACTAAACAAC-3¶
for HP1322; and 5¶-CATGGAAAATAAGCTCACGCCAGC-3¶ and 5¶-TGAGATCGCTTTTATCCATGCC-3¶ for HP0209. Each amplified product was then
cloned into pGEMT-Easy (Promega). The resulting plasmids (pHP0547a,
pHP0209a, and pHP1322a) were then digested with HindIII (cagA) or StuI
(HP0209 and HP1322), blunt ended with Klenow (NEB), and a blunt-ended
promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) reporter cassette
from plasmid pCM7 (ATCC 37173; ref. 21) was inserted into the respective
blunt-ended restriction sites. Plasmids containing the cat cassette in the
desired orientation were identified by PCR. The plasmid used for
construction of the ureA-cat transcriptional fusion has been described
previously (20). H. pylori reporter strains were generated by transformation
of H. pylori strain 26695 SC#7 with the plasmids described above, and transformants were selected on BB-FBS-0.5% agar plates containing 5 Ag/mL
chloramphenicol. The plasmids used in these experiments are unable to
replicate in H. pylori; therefore, chloramphenicol-resistant strains result
from the integration of the cat reporter cassettes into the H. pylori
chromosome. PCR was used to confirm the insertion of the cat reporter
cassettes into the appropriate H. pylori genes and to verify that double
crossover events had occurred. H. pylori strains harboring insertions of a
kanamycin cassette into either cagA or cagE (picB) were generated by
transformation of H. pylori strain 26695 SC#7 with either pMC3-Kan (22) or
picB-Kan (23), respectively.
Transcriptional reporter analyses. The level of CAT expression in each
transcriptional reporter strain was determined using a CAT ELISA kit
(Roche Diagnostics). For analyses of CAT expression, bacterial cultures were
grown overnight in BB-FBS-0.5% medium. The bacteria were centrifuged at
1,000 g, resuspended in BB-FBS-0.25% medium, and then transferred to
medium containing varying salt concentrations and cultured for the
indicated times. Aliquots of H. pylori cells were lysed using the ELISA kit
lysis buffer, and protein concentrations of lysates were determined using
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) reagent kit (Pierce). The amounts of lysate
protein added to each ELISA plate well were 2 Ag ( for HP0209-CAT and
HP1322-CAT reporter strains), 0.25 Ag ( for ureA-CAT), and 0.05 Ag ( for
cagA-CAT). The levels of CAT bound per well were quantified using
protocols provided by the manufacturer. Absorbance data were obtained
using an ELISA plate reader (Dynatech).
Immunoblot analysis of CagA expression. In experiments designed to
analyze CagA protein expression during bacterial growth, H. pylori was
grown in broth cultures containing varying concentrations of NaCl. Bacteria
were lysed using NP40 lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)] supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini;
Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were measured using the
BCA reagent kit and samples were standardized based on protein
concentration. Proteins in the cell lysates were then separated by SDSPAGE (8% SDS-acrylamide gels) and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (TBS

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

containing 0.1% Tween, 3% nonfat powdered milk) and immunoblotted for
1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against CagA (1:6,000
dilution in blocking buffer; Austral Biologicals) followed by rabbit antiserum
to soluble H. pylori proteins (1:10,000 dilution; ref. 24). The membranes were
then washed with TBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; BioRad), diluted 1:6,000 in blocking buffer. Signals were detected on X-ray film
using chemiluminescent methods (Amersham Bioscience). Antibodies were
removed from membranes with a stripping buffer (Pierce) before being
reprobed.
Coculture of H. pylori with AGS gastric cells. Human gastric
carcinoma-derived AGS epithelial cells (CRL-1739; American Type Culture
Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 2
mmol/L L-glutamine and 10% FBS at 37jC in 5% CO2. AGS cells were
routinely passaged every 3 days. AGS cells were seeded into 24-well plates
(2.5  105 per well) and grown for 24 h before addition of H. pylori. H. pylori
cells were cultured overnight in BB-FBS-0.5% and then subcultured for
12 h in fresh BB-FBS containing different concentrations of added NaCl.
Bacteria were then directly added to AGS cells (50:1 ratio of H. pylori to AGS
cells) for the indicated times. Following infection, AGS cells were analyzed
to detect a morphologic change known as the hummingbird phenotype (25).
Quantification of H. pylori binding to AGS cells was done as described by
Franco et al. (26). Briefly, H. pylori-AGS cocultures were washed five times
with PBS (pH 7.5) to remove unbound bacteria, and AGS cells were then
detached by scraping with a rubber policeman. Serial 10-fold dilutions of
the cell suspensions were plated on blood agar plates, and the numbers of
colony-forming units (CFU) were determined 5 days after plating.
To analyze tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA, H. pylori-AGS cocultures
were lysed with NP40 lysis buffer (described above) containing protease
inhibitors and 2 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentrations
were measured using the BCA reagent kit and samples were standardized
based on protein concentration. Proteins in the cell lysates were then
analyzed by immunoblotting as described above, using mouse antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (1:3,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biosciences)
or rabbit antiserum to soluble H. pylori proteins (1:10,000 dilution; ref. 24).
The membranes were then washed with TBS-Tween and incubated for
1 h with either HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham
Biosciences) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:6,000 in
blocking buffer. Signals were detected on X-ray film using chemiluminescent methods. Antibodies were removed from membranes with a stripping
buffer before being reprobed.
Analysis of interleukin-8 secretion. Following infection of AGS cells for
5 h with H. pylori 26695 wild-type (WT) or isogenic mutant strains as
described above, supernatants were removed and the concentrations
of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the supernatants were determined using an
IL-8 cytometric bead assay (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. After 2 h of incubation, samples were analyzed
using a FACSCalibur four-color flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), and the
data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc.). IL-8 concentrations were determined using purified human IL-8 standards provided
with the IL-8 kit.

Results
Effects of salt concentration on H. pylori growth. Because
both high salt intake and H. pylori infection are associated with an
increased risk for gastric cancer, we investigated the possibility that
high salt concentrations might alter gene expression in H. pylori. As
a first step, we analyzed the growth of H. pylori strain 26695 (SC#7)
in BB-FBS medium supplemented with different NaCl concentrations (0.25–2.0%). This range includes salt concentrations that
are both lower and higher than the 0.5% NaCl concentration
typically used for preparation of BB-FBS. In agreement with the
results of a previous study (27), growth of H. pylori strain 26695 was
observed at each of the NaCl concentrations tested. The rate of
bacterial growth was relatively similar for cultures grown in NaCl

Helicobacter pylori and Salt

Figure 1. Growth of H. pylori in medium containing different salt concentrations.
H. pylori strain 26695 was grown overnight in BB-FBS-0.5% medium.
Bacteria from this culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in
BB-FBS-0.25% medium, and inoculated into fresh Brucella-FBS broth containing
different concentrations of added NaCl (0.25–2.0% NaCl). At the indicated time
points, A 600 values of the cultures were measured. Mean results based on
analysis of triplicate cultures from a single experiment are reported; all SDs were
<12% of the reported mean values and are not depicted. At time points >32 h,
clumping of the bacteria resulted in an artifactual reduction in absorbances;
therefore, data for time points >32 h are not reported. The experiment was
repeated five times with similar results.

concentrations ranging from 0.25% to 1.5% (Fig. 1). However, the
rate of bacterial growth was slower in cultures containing 2.0%
NaCl (Fig. 1). To test the effects of NaCl on viability of the bacteria,
cultures containing different concentrations of NaCl were
harvested before the onset of stationary phase, normalized to an
A 600 of 0.1, serial dilutions were plated onto blood agar plates, and
the numbers of CFU (CFU/mL) were determined. The numbers
of CFUs recovered from the normalized cultures were similar,
suggesting that high salt concentrations (2.0% NaCl) retard H. pylori
growth but do not have a bacteriocidal effect (data not shown).
Effect of salt concentration on H. pylori gene expression. We
next investigated the effect of salt concentration on H. pylori gene
expression. RNA was isolated from cultures of H. pylori strain 26695
that were grown for 10 h under two different conditions (either BBFBS-0.25% or BB-FBS-1.5% medium). RNA preparations from eight
independent cultures ( four from each condition) were each
hybridized independently with H. pylori DNA macroarrays. The
mean normalized signal intensity for each array feature was
calculated as described in Materials and Methods. To compare
gene expression in bacteria grown under the two different
conditions, ratios of normalized signal intensities were generated
(signal intensity when grown in BB-FBS-1.5% divided by the signal
intensity when grown in BB-FBS-0.25%). The mean F SD of
intensity ratios was 1.05 F 0.27. Genes that had expression ratios
>2 SD above or below the mean ratio were considered to be
potentially regulated in response to salt concentration. Based on
these criteria, 63 genes were classified as potentially up-regulated
and 61 genes as potentially down-regulated in response to high salt
concentration (Table 1). The list of candidate regulated genes
(Table 1) includes genes that encode heat shock proteins (e.g.,
HP0010, HP0011, and HP1024), genes encoding outer membrane
proteins (e.g., HP0229, HP0671, HP1177, and HP0722), and several
genes associated with H. pylori virulence [(e.g., cagA (HP0547),

www.aacrjournals.org

napA (HP0243), and iceA (HP1209)]. Several genes that encode heat
shock proteins (e.g., HP0010 and HP1024) have been reported
previously to be up-regulated in response to osmotic shock (28).
These data indicate that gene expression in H. pylori is altered
when the bacteria are grown in environments containing different
salt concentrations.
Effect of salt on cagA transcription. One of the genes
regulated in response to salt was cagA. Array analyses indicated
that there was increased cagA transcription (a 2-fold increase in
normalized signal intensity) in bacteria grown in BB-FBS-1.5%
medium compared with bacteria grown in BB-FBS-0.25% medium.
Based on the criteria for identifying salt-regulated genes described
above, the transcription of other genes in the cag PAI was not
regulated in response to salt. To validate the observation that
cagA transcription was regulated in response to salt, we inserted
a promoterless CAT reporter into cagA, thereby generating a
H. pylori cagA-CAT transcriptional reporter strain. In addition,
we constructed three control reporter strains, in which the CAT
cassette was inserted into genes that were not regulated in
response to salt, based on array experiments [ureA, HP0209
(encoding an outer membrane protein designated HofA) and
HP1322 (an ORF of unknown function)]. The H. pylori reporter
strains were cultured in medium containing different NaCl
concentrations for varying lengths of time. After growth for >6 h
in BB-FBS-1.5% medium, the cagA-cat reporter strain expressed
higher levels of CAT activity than when it was grown for the same
length of time in BB-FBS-0.25% or BB-FBS-0.5% medium (Fig. 2A).
The expression of CAT activity by the cagA-cat reporter strain was
also stimulated by overnight growth in medium containing 1.0%
NaCl (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the expression of CAT activity in
ureA-CAT, HP0209-CAT, or HP1322-CAT reporter strains was not
affected by salt concentration (Fig. 2B; data not shown). When the
bacteria were cultured in medium containing low salt concentrations (0.25% or 0.5% NaCl), cagA expression was not affected
by the bacterial growth phase (Fig. 2A). Specifically, under these
conditions (0.25% or 0.5% NaCl), there was no increase in cagA
expression when the bacteria were in stationary phase (36 h)
compared with earlier time points.
Analysis of CagA protein expression. We next investigated the
effects of salt concentration on CagA protein expression. As shown
in Fig. 3, Western blot analyses using a polyclonal anti-CagA
antibody revealed the presence of high molecular mass immunoreactive bands in H. pylori 26695 (SC#7) but not in an isogenic cagA
mutant strain. The presence of multiple immunoreactive bands is
consistent with results of several previous studies that provided
evidence for post-translational modification of CagA (18). Consistent with the transcriptional analysis, the levels of CagA protein
expression were higher in H. pylori cells grown in high-salt medium
than in H. pylori cells grown in medium containing 0.25%, 0.5%, or
0.75% NaCl (Fig. 3). Increases in CagA expression in response to
NaCl were also detected in immunoblotting experiments with
H. pylori strains 60190 and SS1 and several H. pylori strains isolated
from Japanese patients. However, salt-dependent changes in CagA
expression were not detected for several other strains, including
H. pylori strain J99 (data not shown). Western blot analysis of
H. pylori whole cells did not reveal any consistent effect of salt
concentration on VacA expression (data not shown), and similarly,
no effect of salt concentration on vacA transcription was detected
in array experiments (Table 1). Supplementation of the bacterial
culture medium with potassium chloride or potassium acetate
(osmolarity of 0.43 Osm, osmoequivalent to 1.25% NaCl) resulted in

NOTE: H. pylori strain 26695 was grown in medium containing either
1.5% or 0.25% NaCl. Transcriptional profiling and identification of
differentially expressed genes were accomplished as described in the
text. The indicated genes were up-regulated or down-regulated during
growth in BB-FBS-1.5% medium compared with growth in BB-FBS0.25% medium.

increased CagA expression, albeit to a lesser extent than observed
with NaCl. Supplementation of the bacterial culture with
osmoequivalent concentrations of several other solutes (magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, magnesium acetate, sorbitol, or
sucrose) did not result in increased CagA expression.
Effect of salt on H. pylori-AGS cell interactions. When
H. pylori is cocultured with AGS gastric epithelial cells, CagA is
translocated into the epithelial cells via a type IV secretion
pathway, and it subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation
within host cells (8, 25). To analyze translocation and tyrosine
phosphorylation of CagA, AGS cells were infected with H. pylori
26695 for 5 h and then washed to remove unbound H. pylori. The
AGS cells were then lysed and tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA was
detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, the levels of
phosphorylated CagA and total CagA were each markedly
increased in AGS cells infected with H. pylori cells grown in BBFBS-1.0% medium compared with AGS cells infected with H. pylori
grown in low-salt medium.
Translocation of CagA into AGS gastric epithelial cells can result
in a morphologic change known as the hummingbird phenotype,
which is characterized by the appearance of elongated, needleshaped cells (25). To determine if varying salt concentrations
altered the ability of H. pylori to cause the hummingbird
phenotype, H. pylori strains were cultured for 12 h in BB-FBS
containing 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1.0% NaCl, and the bacteria were then
incubated with AGS cells. Cells were inspected microscopically
after incubation for 5 h. The proportion of AGS cells showing
epithelial cell elongation was higher when infected with H. pylori
26695 grown in BB-FBS-1.0% medium than when infected with
H. pylori 26695 grown in medium containing either 0.25% or 0.5%
NaCl (55 F 12% versus 10 F 5% and 15 F 5% elongated cells,
respectively). Representative micrographs are shown in Fig. 4B.
Parallel infections of AGS cells with either an isogenic H. pylori
cagA mutant strain or a cagE mutant strain did not result in the
hummingbird phenotype, regardless of the salt concentrations in
which these H. pylori mutant strains were grown (data not shown).
Similarly, the addition to AGS cells of uninoculated (bacteria-free)
BB-FBS medium containing 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1.0% NaCl did not
produce the hummingbird phenotype. Growth of H. pylori in
medium containing different concentrations of NaCl did not
influence the number of viable H. pylori associated with gastric
epithelial cells (data not shown). Moreover, immunoblot analyses

cells and an enhanced ability of H. pylori to cause alterations in cell
morphology.
Effect of salt on H. pylori–induced IL-8 production by AGS
cells. Two studies (29, 30) showed recently that CagA can stimulate
increased expression of IL-8 in AGS cells. We thus sought to
determine if increased levels of CagA in H. pylori strains grown in
high salt concentrations could affect the ability of H. pylori to
stimulate IL-8 production by AGS cells. H. pylori strains grown in
medium containing varying salt concentrations were added to AGS
cells, and supernatants from the H. pylori-AGS cocultures were
removed after 5 h. The levels of secreted IL-8 were analyzed by flow
cytometry as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in
Fig. 5, WT H. pylori grown in BB-FBS-1.0% medium induced higher
levels of IL-8 secretion than did H. pylori grown in medium
containing lower salt concentrations. The addition of bacteria-free
BB-FBS-0.25% or BB-FBS-1.0% medium to the AGS cells did not
alter IL-8 production (data not shown). As expected, based on
previously reported results (31), cagE (picB) mutant strains were
defective in the ability to induce IL-8 secretion, regardless of the
levels of salt in the growth medium. The cagA mutant strain
induced higher levels of IL-8 production than did the cagE mutant
strain (Fig. 5), but growth of the cagA mutant in high-salt medium
did not alter its ability to elicit IL-8 production in the AGS cells
(Fig. 5). These results indicate that exposure of H. pylori to high salt
conditions enhances the ability of the bacteria to stimulate AGS
cell expression of IL-8 in a CagA-dependent manner.

Discussion
Many epidemiologic studies have reported a correlation between
high levels of dietary salt intake and an increased risk of gastric
cancer (11–13). This association has been detected in prospective
studies (32), case-control studies (33), and in a study that compared
urinary salt excretion with gastric morbidity rates (34). The
mechanisms by which a high-salt diet increases the risk of gastric
cancer in humans are incompletely understood. One possibility is
that salt may have direct effects on the gastric mucosa that lower
the threshold for malignant transformation (35). Another proposed
explanation is that salt damages the gastric mucosa (36), thereby
allowing increased entry of carcinogens into gastric tissue. Whether
H. pylori infection and high salt intake are independent or
interdependent risk factors is not entirely clear. A prospective
study of a Japanese population (37) and a case control study in

of the lysates with an anti–H. pylori antiserum did not reveal any
obvious effect of salt on H. pylori interactions with the AGS cells
(Fig. 4A). These results suggest that exposure of H. pylori to high
salt concentrations increases the level of CagA expression, which in
turn leads to an increased amount of CagA translocated into AGS

Korea (33) each reported that H. pylori–infected subjects
consuming a high-salt diet had an increased risk of gastric cancer
when compared with H. pylori–infected subjects who consumed
lower levels of salt. Another study reported a correlation between
the prevalence of H. pylori infection and levels of dietary salt intake
(38). Studies using a Mongolian gerbil model have shown that the
presence of H. pylori and a high-salt diet have a synergistic effect
on gastric carcinogenesis (15, 39).
In this study, we investigated the changes in H. pylori gene
expression that occur in response to a high-salt environment.
Transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that the expression
of multiple H. pylori genes was altered in response to changes in
the salt concentration of the bacterial culture medium. The NaCl
concentrations tested in the current study ranged from 0.25%
(43 mmol/L) to 2.0% (342 mmol/L). Dietary salt intake varies
widely among humans. Levels of dietary salt intake are reported to
reach 41 g/d in Japan (40) and 55 g/d in China (41). Based on an
average adult stomach volume of f900 mL (42) and an intake
of three meals a day, we estimate that gastric luminal salt
concentrations of 300 mmol/L may commonly be attained or
exceeded in some populations. Therefore, the NaCl concentrations
tested in the current study are likely to be physiologically relevant.
However, salt concentrations in the gastric mucus layer (the
natural niche for H. pylori) are likely to be lower than in the gastric
lumen.
A particularly interesting finding in the current study was the
observation that cagA expression is regulated in response to salt
concentration. Several previous studies provided evidence that

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

expression of cagA is not constitutive. Specifically, modulation of
cagA expression in response to iron concentration (43) and pH
(44, 45) has been reported. The mechanisms by which cagA
expression is regulated in response to environmental conditions
are not yet understood. Potentially, regulation of cagA expression in
response to multiple environmental stimuli is indicative of a
generalized H. pylori stress response. Alternatively, there may be a
variety of regulatory pathways that individually regulate cagA
expression in response to specific environmental conditions. As
shown in Fig. 1, H. pylori can survive and grow in NaCl
concentrations up to 2.0% (342 mmol/L), a result that is consistent
with previous reports (27). However, the growth rate of H. pylori
was retarded when the bacteria were cultured in medium
containing 2% NaCl. As gene expression in H. pylori is altered in
response to growth phase, the observed effects of salt on gene
expression in H. pylori could potentially be related to retardation of
H. pylori growth. However, among the 138 genes listed in Table 1,
only 8 (i.e., cagA, napA, HP0229, HP0630, HP0719, HP1172, HP1200,
and HP1292) were reported previously to be differentially expressed
based on growth phase (46). Moreover, in the current study, CagA
expression was up-regulated in response to NaCl concentrations
(1.0–1.5%) that did not have a substantial effect on H. pylori
growth. Karita et al. (44) detected a growth phase-dependent
change in cagA expression when the bacteria were grown at pH 5
but detected relatively little growth phase-dependent change in
cagA expression when the bacteria were grown at pH 7. Similarly,
under the experimental conditions tested in this study, we did not
detect growth phase-dependent changes in expression of cagA
when the bacteria were grown in BB-FBS-0.25% or BB-FBS-0.5%
medium (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the observed effects of
NaCl on cagA expression are not attributable to salt-induced
effects on the bacterial growth phase.
Epidemiologic studies indicate that the risk of gastric cancer is
higher among humans infected with cagA-positive strains than
among persons infected with cagA-negative strains, and the
development of gastric cancer in the Mongolian gerbil model is

or isogenic mutant strains were grown in broth containing the indicated NaCl
concentrations for 12 h. Bacteria were then added to AGS cells and incubated for
5 h. The tissue culture media were collected, and IL-8 secreted by the AGS
cells was assayed using an IL-8 cytometric bead assay as described in Materials
and Methods. Columns, mean of triplicate samples; bars, SD. Statistical
significance was analyzed using Student’s t test, and P values for the indicated
comparisons are shown.

also dependent on presence of the cag PAI (26, 47, 48). Our present
findings provide further insight into mechanisms by which cagpositive H. pylori strains and high dietary salt intake may
contribute to the development of gastric cancer. Specifically, the
results of this study indicate that high salt concentrations stimulate
increased expression of H. pylori CagA, which in turn leads to an
increased amount of CagA translocated into gastric epithelial cells
and an enhanced ability of H. pylori to alter gastric epithelial cell
function. CagA may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of
gastric cancer by altering signal transduction pathways in gastric
epithelial cells (6). In addition, by causing enhanced secretion of
the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, CagA may indirectly contribute
