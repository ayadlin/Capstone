Abstract
NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling
pathway that regulates cell fate during development and
postnatal life. It has been increasingly linked to carcinogenesis, although its role in cancer seems to be highly context and
tissue specific. Although NOTCH signaling is required for lung
development, little is known about its role in lung cancer. In
this study, we show that NOTCH signaling, as measured by the
;-secretase cleavage product NIC-1, is active in both normal
human and lung tumor samples; however, downstream
NOTCH readouts (i.e., HES-1 and HES-5) are elevated in lung
tumors. Levels of NOTCH signaling components in primary
human lung cells reflect observations in tissue samples, yet
lung tumor cell lines showed little NOTCH signaling. Because
oxygen concentrations are important in normal lung physiology and lung tumors are hypoxic, the effect of low oxygen
on these lung tumor cell lines was evaluated. We found that
hypoxia dramatically elevates NOTCH signaling (especially
NOTCH-1) in lung tumor cell lines and concomitantly
sensitizes them to inhibition via small-molecule ;-secretase
inhibitors or NOTCH-1 RNA interference. ;-Secretase inhibitor–
induced apoptosis of lung tumor cells grown under hypoxic
conditions could be rescued by reintroduction of active
NOTCH-1. Our data strengthen the role of NOTCH in lung
cancer and as a therapeutic target for the treatment of lung
and other hypoxic tumor types. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):7954–9]

Introduction
Lung cancers are the most common malignancies in the United
States, accounting for 31% of male and 26% of female cancerrelated deaths (1). Adenocarcinoma of the lung (ACL) represents
f50% of all lung cancers (2), and 15% to 20% of ACL cases occur in
nonsmokers (2). Genetic data in nonsmokers (2) suggest that
unidentified carcinogens may be one cause of ACL in the
nonsmoking population. Despite treatment, the 5-year survival
rate for ACL is 15% (1); thus, it is imperative that novel targets and
therapies are identified.
NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that
regulates critical cell fate decisions (3). In humans, NOTCH

signaling is mediated by a family of transmembrane receptors
(NOTCH-1 to NOTCH-4) and ligands (JAGGED-1 and JAGGED-2
and DELTA-like 1, 3, and 4; ref. 3). NOTCH receptors consist
of a modular NH2-terminal extracellular subunit (NEC) noncovalently bound to the COOH-terminal transmembrane domain
(NTM) subunit (4).
NOTCH ligands are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are
presented to NOTCH receptors by a neighboring cell. On ligand
binding, NOTCH receptors undergo proteolytic modifications in
the NTM, which makes them susceptible to final cleavage by a
presenilin-1–dependent g-secretase (3). This process leads to the
release of the activated form of NOTCH (intracellular NOTCH or
NIC), which translocates to the nucleus where it modulates gene
expression primarily by binding to ubiquitous transcription factor
CBF-1 in humans (3). NOTCH target genes include several helixloop-helix transcription factors collectively named Hairy/enhancer
of split (HES) and HEY (3). Many of these are negative transcriptional regulators that inhibit differentiation-inducing factors
during development contributing to the maintenance of a
precommitted cell state for proper interpretation of differentiation
or proliferation stimuli (3). Knockout mouse studies have shown
that NOTCH signaling is required for lung development (5). During
postnatal life, NOTCH regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis
is context dependent (6) and although in certain tissues NOTCH is
suggested to play a tumor suppressor role (6), NOTCH signaling
is increasingly linked to oncogenicity (7). In light of mounting
evidence for a role of NOTCH in cancer, little is known about
NOTCH in lung cancer. Although expression of constitutively
active NOTCH-1 caused growth arrest in small cell lung cancer
cells (8), NOTCH-3 seems overexpressed in 30% to 40% of non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; ref. 9). Moreover, a t(15:19)
chromosomal translocation has been detected in some lung cancer
and derived cell lines, suggesting that NOTCH-3 may be an
oncogene in NSCLC (10). Here, we have studied the expression
levels and the biological effects of NOTCH signaling in ACL using
cell lines and frozen tumor biopsies.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, hypoxia, and ;-secretase inhibitor. Human bronchial
epithelial cells 4F0439 and 4F0624 and small airway epithelial cells 3F1584,
4F0001, and 4F0715 were cultured as recommended (Cambrex). Human
lung fibroblasts MRC5 and CRL-7285 [American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC)] were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). We
used NSCLC cell lines of different histologic subtypes [i.e., H226 and HCC95
(squamous cell carcinomas); HCC1171 (large cell carcinoma); and H1395,
H1755, HCC2374, A549, HCC827, H1299, and H2347 (adenocarcinomas)]. All
lines were from ATCC. Cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10%
FBS. All cells were fingerprinted using the GenePrint fluorescent STR
system (Promega). Cells grown in hypoxia were maintained in chambers

(Stem Cell Technologies) filled with certified 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2
(Airgas North Central) at 37jC. Oxygen concentration was measured with
MiniOX1 oxygen meters (Mine Safety Appliances Co.).
We used the g-secretase inhibitor MRK003 (11). This compound was
dissolved in DMSO to make 40 mmol/L stock solutions.
Plasmids and lentiviral vectors. The pNIC-1 plasmid expresses
NOTCH-1 NIC cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.0
(Invitrogen; ref. 12). This same cDNA was inserted into pLenti4/TO/V5DEST (tetracycline-inducible ViraPower T-Rex Lentiviral system, Invitrogen)
to obtain pNIC1-DEST plasmid. pNIC-1 and control vectors were transfected
by electroporation. The vector expressing a short hairpin targeting
NOTCH-1 (shN1) was constructed by annealing two oligonucleotides
(5¶-GATCCTCGAGAGCGACCGCTGCCTGGATCCAAGATCAATGGTGAAGCAGATGCATTGATCTTGTCCAGGCAGCGGCTGCCCTCGAG-3¶ and
5¶-AATTCTCGAGGGCAGCCGCTGCCTGGACAAGATCAATGCATCTGCTTCACCATTGATCTTGGATCCAGGCAGCGGTCGCTCTCGAG-3¶). The
resulting dsDNA was ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pENTRgus (Invitrogen). The shN1 sequence was transferred to lentiviral expression
vector pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST to generate pshN1-DEST following the
manufacturer’s instructions. To generate tetracycline-inducible, stable cell
lines, ACL cells were first infected with tetracycline regulator lentivirus.
Stable tetracycline regulator–expressing cells were then infected with
pNIC1-DEST virus, pshN1-DEST virus, or pDEST virus, respectively.
Lentiviral packaging and selection of transduced cells were done as
recommended (Invitrogen). Doxycycline-inducible expression of NIC-1 was
verified by Western blot.
Antibodies. We used the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antiNOTCH-1 (C-20), rabbit polyclonal anti-NOTCH-3 (M134), rabbit polyclonal
anti-NOTCH-4 (H-225), goat polyclonal anti-JAGGED-1 (C-20), goat
polyclonal anti-DELTX (C-20), mouse monoclonal anti–hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF-1a; 28b), mouse monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1)-horseradish

peroxidase, goat polyclonal anti-AKT (C20), rabbit polyclonal anti-BAX
(N-20), and mouse monoclonal anti-BCL-2 (C-2; all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal anti-NOTCH-2 was from Abcam. Rabbit
polyclonal anti-cleaved NOTCH-1 (Val1744), rabbit monoclonal anti–
phospho-AKT (Ser473), rabbit polyclonal anti–c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(JNK), and rabbit monoclonal anti–phospho-JNK (T183/Y185) were from
Cell Signaling. Mouse monoclonal anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Chemicon. One hundred micrograms of
total cell lysates were run onto 10% SDS-PAGE and assayed by Western blot
following standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry on frozen biopsies
was done following standard procedures.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA from cultured cells
was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit, whereas RNA from frozen biopsies
was extracted with RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with
First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). Quantitative real-time PCR
was done with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an
ABI 7300 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. For each sample, a serial dilution of
cDNA template was measured in triplicate. Non–reverse transcription
reactions served as controls. All measurements were normalized for 18S
rRNA. Comparison between groups were analyzed by Student’s t test, with
a = 0.05.
Cell viability assays. Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay kit
(Roche). The results were verified by trypan blue assays. Results were
expressed as mean F SD of three independent experiments. Comparison
between control and g-secretase inhibitor treatment was analyzed by
Student’s t test.
Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-phycoerythrin/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; BD FACSCanto;
Becton Dickinson).

Results and Discussion
We measured the expression levels of the four NOTCH receptors
and ligands JAGGED-1 and DELTA-1 and DELTA-4 in 10 NSCLC
cell lines compared with primary bronchoepithelial, small airway
epithelial, and lung fibroblast by Western blot (Fig. 1A and B). All
NSCLCs showed reduced expression of several components of the
NOTCH signaling pathway compared with primary bronchoepithelial and small airway epithelial. The seven ACL lines displayed
reduced or undetectable amounts of NOTCH-1 (Fig. 1A), with
similar observations made at the mRNA level (Fig. 1C). The mRNA
expression levels of NOTCH downstream effector HES-5 reflected
what was observed at the protein level with exception of two NSCLC
lines (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained measuring other
NOTCH targets, such as HES-1 and HEY-1 (data not shown). Overall,
the expression levels of NOTCH components in ACL cell lines were
more similar to those of lung fibroblasts than to those of primary
lung epithelial cells, suggesting epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Because primary cells and cell lines are cultured in different
media, we tested whether this could explain differences in expression. We compared NOTCH-1 expression levels in one ACL cell line
and in one SA culture grown in RPMI 1640 and the media used for
primary cells. We detected no differences in NOTCH-1 levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Because NOTCH-1 expression seemed to
be specifically lost in ACL cell lines, we focused on this receptor.
We tested 11 matched frozen biopsies of ACL and normal lung
by immunohistochemistry using a highly specific antibody recognizing NIC-1 (active NOTCH-1; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Lung
epithelia showed a strong nuclear staining for NIC-1, whereas ACL
samples displayed reduced NIC-1 expression, with some tumor areas
showing undetectable staining (Supplementary Fig. S2B and C).
When we expressed NIC-1 in ACL lines either through transient
transfection or via a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector, NIC-1
induced apoptosis (Fig. 2) mediated at least in part by reduced

expression of antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2 and MCL-1 and by
increased expression of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosisinducing ligand (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggested
that NOTCH-1 could play a tumor-suppressive role in ACL. We
therefore tested the hypothesis that NOTCH signaling is reduced in
ACL compared with normal lung by measuring HES-1 mRNA expression in matched tumor lung biopsies. The results showed that mRNA
expression of this NOTCH downstream transcription factor was
either the same or increased in ACL biopsies compared with normal
lung (Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar results were obtained when
measuring the HES-5 mRNA expression levels (data not shown).
This suggested that the activation status of the pathway does not
correlate with the levels of NIC-1 detected by immunohistochemistry
and that other factors contribute to regulating NOTCH pathway
activity in ACL. Lung cancers are significantly hypoxic compared
with normal lung epithelia (13). A recent study has shown that
HIF-1a potentiates CBF-1–mediated transcription through direct
association with NOTCH-1/CBF-1 transcriptional complexes (14).
Thus, we investigated the NOTCH signaling pathway in two
ACL lines (A549 and H1755) under hypoxia. We found that, in 1%
oxygen, mRNA expression levels of the NOTCH downstream factors
HES-1, HEY-1, and HEY-2 were increased compared with those
measured in the same cells cultured in normoxia (Fig. 3A). Under
hypoxia, HIF-1a increased as did the total amount of NOTCH-1;
however, steady-state levels of NIC-1 showed only a modest increase
(Fig. 3B), suggesting rapid activation followed by degradation. Other
components of the NOTCH signaling pathway seemed unaffected by
hypoxia (Fig. 3B). In agreement with protein levels, hypoxia induced
NOTCH-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C), anticipated to further support
NOTCH signaling because NOTCH-1 expression is under a positive
feedback loop (15). To understand the biological function of NOTCH
signaling in ACL lines grown in hypoxia, we inhibited the pathway
using the g-secretase inhibitor MRK-003 (11). When ACL lines were

Figure 2. Expression of constitutively active NOTCH-1 in ACL cells causes cell death. Representative experiment. A, forced expression of NIC-1 in H1755 cell line
at the specified hour after transfection of control plasmid (lanes 1–4 ) and plasmid containing NIC-1 (lanes 5–8 ). After transfection, 100 Ag of whole-cell lysates
were analyzed by Western blot analysis. B, Annexin V/7-AAD double staining and FACS analysis to measure the rate of apoptosis of cells shown in [A, lane 4 (left) and
lane 8 (right )]. According to our FACS specialist (Patricia Simms, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL), the positioning of the quadrants in left and right has been set
as the most biologically relevant. This is due to the significantly different number of death cells between the two samples, which affects the binding of Annexin V.
C, Western blot analysis was done to detect the expression of NIC-1 on lentivirus transduction (see Materials and Methods and text). Note the low levels of NIC-1
expression. After a series of doxycycline dilution experiments (data not shown), we determined that such level of NIC-1 was comparable with that of primary
airway epithelial cells. D, viability of A549 cells transduced with the control retroviral vector (DEST ) or with the vector expressing NIC-1 (NIC-1). Cells (105) were
transduced with the respective vectors; 4 wks after doxycycline treatment, cells were stained with crystal violet. The results showed complete absence of cells in the
NIC-1–transduced population.

Figure 3. Hypoxia up-regulates the NOTCH
signaling pathway in ACL cell lines. A, upregulation of mRNA expression of NOTCH
downstream target genes by hypoxia. Cells were
cultured in regular incubator (21% O2) or in
hypoxic chambers (1% O2) for 48 h. Then, mRNA
expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR.
The expression levels of the mRNAs of the genes
of interest were normalized to 18S rRNA. Relative
expression is calculated as normalized level of
each mRNA in hypoxia-treated cells compared
with normoxic conditions (the latter are set as
1 arbitrary unit). Columns, relative expression
(six independent measurements); bars, SD.
We show the results obtained in ACL cell lines
A549 and H1755. Similar results were obtained
in other two ACL cell lines (data not shown).
B, hypoxia specifically up-regulates NOTCH-1
protein expression. Western blot analysis was
done 48 h of either normoxic or hypoxic
incubation. Note that the protein levels of total
NOTCH-1, cleaved NOTCH-1, and HIF-1a are
increased by hypoxia, whereas other components
of the NOTCH signaling pathway seem unaffected
by hypoxia. C, hypoxia up-regulates NOTCH-1
mRNA expression levels. The relative expression
of mRNA was determined as described in (A).

exposed to increasing concentration of MRK-003, we observed dosedependent accumulation of NTM-1 and corresponding loss of NIC-1
(Fig. 4A), confirming that NOTCH-1 cleavage was inhibited. As a
further control, we measured HES-1 mRNA expression levels in cells
treated with MRK-003 under normoxia and hypoxia. We found that
in hypoxia, MRK-003 treatment reduced the expression of HES-1
mRNA 685-fold (Fig. 4B), further confirming MRK-003–mediated
NOTCH signaling inhibition. MRK-003 treatment caused a potent
apoptotic response in ACL cells as early as 48 h after treatment
(Fig. 4C, middle). This apoptotic response was reduced if NIC-1 was
reexpressed in these cells through doxycycline-inducible lentivirus
(Fig. 4C, top right), whereas doxycycline did not affect cells
transduced with control lentivirus (Fig. 4C, bottom right). Importantly, MRK-003 treatment specifically killed ACL cells under hypoxia
but had no effect under normoxia (Fig. 4D). Expression of NIC-1 in
ACL cells exposed to MRK-003 in hypoxia did not rescue the totality
of cells. This can be explained by the fact that g-secretase inhibitors
prevent the activation of all four NOTCH receptors (16) or to offtarget effects. Thus, we used a genetic strategy by down-regulating
NOTCH-1 under hypoxia using a RNA interference (RNAi) approach.
A shN1 was cloned into the pLenti4/TO/V5-DEST and the ACL cell
line A549 was transduced with this construct. When transcription of
NOTCH-1 targeting small hairpin RNA was induced by doxycycline
in this cell line under hypoxia, apoptosis resulted (Supplementary
Fig. S5), further confirming that NOTCH-1 signaling is required for
ACL cell survival under hypoxia.
Our data show that the biological outcome of NOTCH signaling
in lung cancer depends on oxygen concentrations. When ACL cell
lines were studied under standard tissue culture conditions, NOTCH1 seemed to have tumor-suppressive activities, whereas under
hypoxia (a condition that more closely reflects tumor physiology;
ref. 13), NOTCH seems to be essential for cell survival. This may

www.aacrjournals.org

explain part of the controversy about the role of NOTCH signaling in
cancer (6). Furthermore, our data suggested that the role of hypoxia
should be carefully considered when reexamining earlier studies
showing tumor suppressor activities for NOTCH (e.g., refs. 17–19).
The effects of NOTCH signaling are notoriously dose dependent
(7). It is likely that mechanisms have evolved whereby cells with
excessive NOTCH activity die, as is the case for other well-known
oncogenes. An excess of NIC is toxic for numerous cell types
in vitro, and cells use multiple mechanisms to maintain optimal
levels of NOTCH activity (7). In normal human keratinocytes,
NOTCH-1 causes growth arrest at high levels and transformation
at low levels (7). Under hypoxia, which potentiates the strength of
NOTCH signaling, the low levels of NIC-1 protein may reflect rapid
activation-degradation. Alternatively, ACL cells may reduce total
NOTCH protein expression to prevent hyperactivation and
maintain NOTCH signaling to levels compatible with life. Our data
do not exclude a participation of NOTCH-3 in the pathogenesis of
ACL. Indeed, cross-talk between NOTCH-1 and NOTCH-3 has been
described is some systems (7). Nonetheless, NOTCH-1 signaling
seems essential for survival of ACL cells under hypoxia. Our data
suggest that targeting NOTCH signaling using g-secretase inhibitors may be an attractive therapeutic strategy to treat highly lethal
ACL and possibly other commonly hypoxic malignancies (20).

leads to a f3.6 increase in the amount of dead cells.
Constitutively active NOTCH-1 reexpression in
these cells leads to a f2-fold reduction of dead cells
despite MRK-003 treatment. Similar results were obtained
