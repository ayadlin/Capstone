ABSTRACT
Bevacizumab (BV) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting vascular
endothelial growth factor and it is the first molecular-targeted agent to be used for
the treatment of ovarian cancer (OC). Randomized Phase III trials evaluated the
combination of BV plus standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced
OC and for platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant recurrent OC. These trials
reported a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival but
not in overall survival. Furthermore, BV effectively improved the quality of life with
regard to abdominal symptoms in recurrent OC patients. Bevacizumab is associated
with adverse events such as hypertension, bleeding, thromboembolism, proteinuria,
delayed wound healing, and gastrointestinal events. However, most of these events
can be adequately managed. This review describes the latest evidence for BV
treatment of OC and selection of patients for personalized treatment.

INTRODUCTION

followed by a chemotherapeutic association of platinum
and taxanes, according to different schedules [2-5].
Even if this first line chemotherapy is highly active,
with ORR >75%, a large number of patients recur or
experience cancer progression, finally dying for this
disease (only 10-30% experience long term survival).
These patients are candidates for second-line
chemotherapy, unfortunately with conflicting and
poor results [6-12]. Nevertheless recurrent OC may be
chemosensitive to platinum and therefore patients can
be still treated selected with platinum-based schedules.
Usually ORR and TFI (treatment-free interval) are directly
proportional. On the other site, patients not responding
to platinum chemotherapy (platinum refractory) and
those presenting early relapse, within six months of
treatment with platinum (platinum resistant), need further
chemotherapy with non-cross resistant drugs. According
to this concept, it is clear that new strategies are needed in
order to improve clinical outcome in these poor prognosis
patients.
More than 10 years ago, scientific evidences showed
that paclitaxel seemed to be more effective when given

Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most debated
oncologic disease in western and industrialized countries
for different reasons. It is the second most common
malignant gynecological disease, constantly showing an
increase of incidence and prevalence; moreover among
all the gynecological tumors it shows the main highest
of mortality; despite recent important advances in early
diagnosis it is usually detected at a very advanced stage;
finally its prognosis remains unsatisfactory even today,
with poor survival rates, despite the current availability
of many active and emerging drugs (in Europe, in women
diagnosed between 2000 and 2007, mean 5-years survival
was about 37.6%) [1].
There is also great debate and confusion about who
is the specialist appointed to manage the patient with OC;
often this uncertainty implies that OC is frequently treated
in centers not sufficiently skilled by a multidisciplinary
point of view. The recognized standard treatment for OC
is aggressive cytoreductive surgery (when it is possible),

weekly and that a part of this additional benefit may be
due to an antiangiogenic effect [13]. Thus in the last years,
in order to improve patients prognosis, a large number of
trials were developed, investigating new targeted agents
and specific molecular targets involved in the onset and
progression of OC, including anti-angiogenesis agents. A
number of key pathways are involved in the angiogenesis
process. Some of these pathways seem to play a
preeminent role: PDGF, VEGF, angiopoietin-Tie2 receptor
and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) [14]. In this context a
strong evidence has developed confirming that alterations
and disruption of angiogenesis mechanisms are involved
in the progression of OC, activating tumor growth,
progression and metastatic spreading [15-16]. Already it
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has showed that increased angiogenesis, evaluated with
increased tumor microvessel density (MVD), plays an
unfavourable therapeutic effect since it is related with a
reduced delivery and availability of chemotherapeutic
drugs; this mechanism impaired clinical outcome in many
tumors, including OC [15-18]. According to these data,
in the last years an emerging scientific interest developed
in order to investigate the role of angiogenesis inhibitors
in OC patients [19-22]. Moreover, it is important to
remember that anti-angiogenic drugs show a synergical
effect with conventional chemotherapeutic agents
and a different toxicity profile, due to their different
mechanisms of action. In this context, since these targeted
molecules are generally less toxic compared to traditional
12390

chemotherapeutic drugs, we must better explore their role
in the management of OC patients, as single agents or in
association with other chemotherapeutic or targeted drugs,
in order to treat more patients with innovative therapeutic
schedules.
But, unfortunately, there is still much to discover:
since there are still conflicting and uncertain results in term
of clinical outcome in patients receiving anti-angiogenesis
therapy, it is useful to evaluate their effective impact in
OC conducting phase III trials, evaluating safety, PFS and
OS (see tables 1 and 2) . BV is a MAb targeting VEGFR
ligand and is currently the most investigated angiogenesis
inhibitor in cancer patients. This targeted agent inhibits
neoplastic vascularization, reducing the formation of
new blood vessels, their number, density, diameter and
permeability [23]. We can certainly say that with BV, the
first angiogenesis inhibitor approved by FDA [24], the
era of anti-angiogenesis therapy in clinical oncology was
started. According to the promising results in other tumors,
in the last years many studies have started investigating
the role of BV in OC, as single agent or associated
with other traditional drugs, showing an interesting and
promising activity also in patients with recurrent disease
[25-30]. Despite the availability of many new angiogenesis
inhibitors explored in the therapy of OC, still today BV is
the most investigated drug in this area, proving more and
more to be a drug reference for this disease. To confirm
this, we report that in USA Clinical Trial website there
are at moment about 114 international registered trials
investigating the use of BV in OC [31].

and results were similar in TC and TCP groups (p value
was 0.16 and HR 0.908); in the study the association of
TC with BV showed a mPFS significantly longer than
TC schedule (p value < 0.001 and HR of 0.717) [21]. The
authors investigated median OS (mOS) and quality of
life (QoL) as secondary endpoints. Regarding mOS the
three treatment groups didn´t show significant differences.
In comparison with the controls, the risk of death was
estimated about 1.036 (p value = 0.76) in the TCP
group and 0.915 (p = 0.45) in the TCBV one. A specific
parameter Trial outcome index (TOI) was used in order
to evaluate QoL analyzing the functional assessment of
ovarian cancer treatment; during maintenance therapy no
significant difference has been observed between the three
groups. In TCP and TCBV groups, QOL before cycle 4
and cycle 7 was lower than that of the TC group [21].
The second trial we are going to analyze is ICON
7, a randomized open label study of phase III, that
investigated on the clinical impact of BV in combination
with chemotherapy [22].
This two arms trial enrolled 1,528 OC women with
the following characteristics: clear cell G3 OC I-IIA
staging (G3), stage IIB-IV OC, carcinoma of the fallopian
tube or peritoneal cancer. Two randomized groups were
selected: TC therapy was given every 21 days for a total of
six cycles in a group; in the second group BV was added
(at 7.5 mg/kg) and was given concomitantly for 5-6 cycles
and continued for 12 additional cycles (TCBV). Primary
endpoint was mPFS and it was significantly prolonged
with BV (HR 0.81; p = 0.0041) [22].
Secondary endpoints were mOS, QoL and ORR.
With 48.9 months of follow up, in contrast with data for
progression free survival, no mOS benefit was reported
in patients assigned to the TCBV schedule (HR 0.85; p
= 0.11). A subsequent exploratory evaluation was able
to detect a significant difference in OS in a subgroup
of patients with disease at fourth stage, not surgical
resectable tumor or sub-optimally resected disease (stage
III) with residual tumor >1 cm (defined as poor prognosis)
and treated with BV (p value = 0.03). In low-medium risk
cases there were no significant differencebetween two
groups in term of OS (p value = 0.20). Regarding QoL,
TCBV group experiencedworse results (p value < 0.0001).
About ORR, in the TC group 48% obtained complete or
partial remission versus 67% in TCBV group (p < 0.001)
[22].

LINE

In the landscape of front-line OC therapy, two
important recent trials investigated the employ of BV to
chemotherapy: the GOG218 trial and the ICON7 trial.
In 2011 the GOG Group reported data from the
randomized phase III GOG218 trial. In this study 1873
women with III-IV stage tumors (epithelial OC or
fallopian/peritoneal cancer )were enrolled . The patients
were free of therapy after surgical approach [21].
Women were randomly assigned to three different
arms in order to evaluate BV activity when associated with
standard schedule. Treatment cycles were given every 21
days and all patients received six cycles of chemotherapy
with taxol and carboplatin. The control therapy was
standard chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin
(TC) plus placebo, added in cycles 2 trough 22 (n = 625);
the BV-starting (TCP) therapy was standard chemotherapy
associated to BV (at dose of 15 mg/kg) added in cycles
two trough six. The schedule was followed by placebo (n
= 625); the BV-throughout (TCBV) therapy was standard
chemotherapy plus BV added in cycles 2 trough 22 (n =
623). TC therapy and BV (or placebo) were administered
every 21 days. Primary endpoint was median PFS (mPFS)

CANCER
In Aurelia trial, 361 patients progressing within 6
months after the end of ≥ 4 platinum based chemotherapy
cycles were enrolled [20]. Patients treated with more
than 2 previous regimens of chemotherapy or patients
with refractory tumor were excluded, as well as women
with previous history of gastrointestinal diseases

Patients received single-agent chemotherapy
according to the following options: paclitaxel with a
weekly schedule, liposomal adriamicin, every 4 weeks,
5 days of therapy with topotecan repeated every 3
weeks.Women were assignedto be treated only with
chemotherapy or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3
weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in topotecan treated
patients).Treatment was discontinued in case of tumor
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
In the study cross over to BV were possible in case
of clear evidence of progression. Patients in the BV-CT
arm were treated with standard therapy without BV at
progression.
Primary objective of the study was reached, because
a significant increase of mPFS (3.4 versus 6.7 months, p

mPFS benefit was observed in all subgroups evaluated.
The improvement was remarkable in women with ascites.

In the Oceans trial [19], 484 patients with platinumsensitive recurrent OC were randomized to treatment with
Carboplatin and Gemcitabine (GC) associated to BV (15
mg/kg) or PL (from 6 to 10 cycles). Patients continued the
treatment until disease progression.

CA-125 elevation alone was not enough to establish
progression, that could be determined by clinical
progression. Regarding to the use of subsequent treatment
after disease progression, 88% of patients in PL arm were
treated and 84% in BV arm, including BV in 31% of the
PL group and 15% of the BV group.
Patients pretreated with Bevacizumab or other
VEGF inhibitors and those with previous gastrointestinal
perforations and obstructions, , abscesses, fistulas , were
excluded. In the BV arm the median PFS was better than
in the PL arm (12.4 months versus 8.4 months, p-value:
p < 0.0001, HR = 0.484,); the ORR was increased with
the addition of BV (78.5% v 57.4%; p < 0.0001). In the
analyses of all subgroups, including age, performance
status, platinum-free interval and surgical cytoreductione
for relapsed disease, BV demonstrated significantly
improved mPFS. OS was similar between the two groups
(GC+BV: 33.6 months; GC+Placebo: 32.9 months; p
value: 0.65, HR = 0.95); it appeared consistent in the two
groups (median follow-up was 58.2 months in the GCBV
arm and 56.4 in GCP arm). Post progression survival
(PPS) was 24 months; this could be linked to the four
months difference occurred in mPFS but not in mOS. [19]
The randomized phase III trial GOG213, compared
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the activity of carboplatin, taxol and gemcitabine with
or without Bevacizumab in patients with ovarian cancer,
fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal carcinoma.
Eligible patients must have experienced clinical
complete response to taxane-platinum chemotherapy and
a minimum of 6 months of treatment-free period without
clinical evidence of progression. Also women receiving
maintenance targeted or endocrine therapy were eligible,
but after at least 4 weeks since last infusion of biological
therapy.
Patients were randomized to chemotherapy if they
were not candidates for surgical cytoreduction.
Exclusion criteria were the following: more than
one previous regimen of chemotherapy, secondary
cytoreduction, need of parenteral nutrition; previous bowel
perforation and/or obstruction, active bleeding or high risk
of bleeding linked to other pathologies. Primary outcome
were OS; secondary outcome were QoL, safety, molecular
and/or biochemical profiles, PFS.
GOG213 accrued 674 women with recurring disease
after frontline or maintenance therapy, including prior
use of BV.In case of biochemical recurrence, surgical
randomization was not permitted and chemotherapy
schedule alone should have been considered.

The aim of the trial was selected in order to analyze
activity of BV (at 15 mg/kg) associated to carboplatin
and paclitaxel in a schedule of 6 cycles followed by BV
maintenance therapy versus chemotherapy alone.
Interim data were presented during the international
Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology in 2015
[32].
An OS in the BV arm of 42.2 months was reported
vs 37.3 in the chemotherapy arm (HR: 0.83, p value:056).
A median PFS of 13.8 ms was reported in BV group vs
10.4 in chemotherapy arm (HR: 0.61, p value < 0.0001).
A risk reduction of progressive disease (39%) and death
(17%), was registered.
The recruitment for the second aim of the study
(investigating on secondary cytoreduction before
chemotherapy) is ongoing. Primary endpoint was OS for
both objectives; secondary endpoints were: PFS, QoL,
safety and toxicity.

neutropenia of grade 4 and febrile neutropenia, venous
or arterial thrombosis, and wound disruption. [21]. Fatal
AEs were reported in 1.0% of patients in the TC arm, in
1.6% in TCP arm, and in 2.3% in the TCBV arm. Only
proteinuria, hypertension, pain were more frequent with
extended treatment than with chemotherapy schedule, in
TCBV arm [21].
In Aurelia trial, there was a higher frequency with
the use of BV of grade ≥ 2 proteinuria and hypertension.
[20]. A grade ≥2 of GIP was observed in 2.2% of patients
treated with BV-CT. The same toxicity was not observed
in pts treated with CT alone. In the BV-CT arm, in which
there was a higher chemotherapy exposure, peripheral
sensory neuropathy and hand-foot syndrome were
observed more frequently.
In Oceans trial [19], the overall incidence of serious
AEs ( ≥ grade 3) was more frequent in BV treated patients
than in placebo group (24.9% versus 34.8%). Grade ≥ 3
hypertension (17.4% vs < 1%), venous thromboembolism
(2.6 % vs 4.0 %) and proteinuria (8.5% vs < 1%) occurred
more frequently in the BV group. No differences in
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia rates were observed
in both groups. None new safety concerns were observed.
GIP occurred in two patients of BV group.
In the GOG213 [32], AEs were more common in
BV-containing treatment, but within expected percentages.
Infections (13% vs 6%) thromboembolism (4% vs 1%),
hypertension (12% vs < 1%), GIP or fistula/abscess (15%
vs 4%) and proteinuria (8% vs 0%) were the main AEs of
severe grade (≥3) for the BV arm versus chemotherapy
arm. Two deaths were reported in the patients treated with
chemotherapy and 9 in the BV arm (7 possibly related to
therapy).
At ASCO 2015 the authors reported intervention
related Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) [34].
Patients assigned to CT arm (298; 88%) or BVCT arm (302; 90%) were evaluable in term of QoL.
Compliance to therapy was 93% at baseline; it lowered
to 88% after cycle 3,to 83% after cycle 6, to 82% after 6
months and 78% after 12 months. The FACT-O TOI scores
were similar at baseline. No differences were shown in
treatment side effects related to BV, with the exclusion
of an impaired physical well-being occurring before cycle
3, worsened by treatment (p value: 0.028).In CPB group
there was a decrease in physical activity (p value: 0.0156).
Difference of 3.4 points (p value: 0.048) after cycle 3 and
6.8 points (p value:0.0004) after cycle 6.

BEVACIZUMAB-RELATED TOXICITY
Main adverse events (AEs) following BV infusion
arebleeding, thromboembolism, delayed wound healing,
proteinuria, hypertension, and gastrointestinal adverse
events (Table 3).
Data from the ICON7 study, showed that 56%
of the women in the TC arm and 66% of TCBV arm
reported AEs of grade 3 or higher [22]. Treatment with
BV was associated with different AEs. A grade 1-2
mucocutaneous bleeding was observed in 36% of patients
in BV arm versus 7% of those in the control group [33].
Eighteen percent of women treated with antiangiogenetic
therapy experienced hypertension versus 2% of control
group. In the TCBV group 7% of women showed grade
3-4 thromboembolic events versus 3% of patients in
the TC group [22]. One percent of patients recruited in
experimental group presented GIP vs < 1% in the control
group. In extended follow-up of OS, one gastrointestinal
fistula grade 3 and 3 grade 2 accidents (sarcoidosis,
cardiac failure, and feet fractures) were also reported,
all occurring in patients treated with BV [33]. In the
TCBV arm, patients receiving BV with their first cycle of
chemotherapy had abscesses, fistulas, or gastrointestinal
perforations in similar percentage compared to those that
did not receive BV at first cycle (3% and 4%, respectively)
[22].
In GOG218 therapy was discontinued, due to AEs,
in a more consistent rate of pts recruited in TCP arm
(15%) and TCBV (17%) than in the TC arm (12 %). It´s
remarkable that 76% of these AEs occurred during the
chemotherapy period.
Hypertension occurred more frequently with BV
than placebo; for this reason drug discontinuation was
reported in only 2.4% of pts in the TCBV arm [21]. The

patients) was performed by Ye Q [35].
Bevacizumab significantly increased ORR,
compared with chemotherapy alone (OR = 2.17) and was
significantly beneficial in first-line therapy (OR = 1.90)
and in patients with recurrent OC (OR = 2.77).
The addition of BV significantly improved PFS (HR
= 0.69), and the subgroup analysis found a significant
increase in PFS for both first-line (HR = 0.83) and second
line therapy (HR = 0.48). No significant differences in
term of OS were reported (HR = 0.934).
Patients receiving BV had a greater risk ( 2.7 ) of

grade ≥ 2 GI adverse event, of grade ≥2 hypertension, (4.6)
of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria (4.9) and of arterial thrombosis
(2). There was no difference in the risk of significant
venous thromboembolism.
In second meta-analysis by Mingyi Zhou [36], 3621
patients were considered: 1808 received BV plus standard
chemotherapy and 1813 received chemotherapy alone.
Improved PFS was observed with chemotherapy
plus BV as adjuvant therapy after initial surgical treatment
(HR = 0.82; p value :0.000). A significant improving of
PFS was also shown with the use of chemotherapy plus
12395

Oncotarget

BV in patients with platinum-sensitive and platinumresistant disease (HR = 0.48; p value : 0.000).
An increased OS was observed with the association
of chemotherapy plus BV (HR: 0.87; p value: 0.026) for
patients treated with surgery with recent diagnosis of OC.
OCEANS study showed similar results in OS
between two arms and this endpoint was not achieved,
until publication of this meta-analysis, in AURELIA.
The benefit of BV in term of PFS in newly
diagnosed OC patients was stratified basing on various
prognostic factors. Women presenting an high risk of
progressive disease (stage III, macroscopic residual
tumor>1 cm and stage IV) received clinical benefit from
BV, as well as patients with a lower risk of progressive
disease (I, II and III stage, macroscopic residual disease ≤
1 cm) (high risk: HR:0.72; p value: 0.001; low risk: HR:
0.77 ; p value:0.001).
ICON7 trial showed no benefit from BV treatment
for women with low risk for progressive disease. This
result could be related to ICON7 recruitment: also patients
withI-II stage were included in low risk subgroup.
The benefit of BV addition was observed only in
patients younger than 70 ( < 60 yr: HR:0.77; p value:
0.001; 60-69 yr: HR: 0.76; p value: 0.003), while in
patients aged 70 years or more no significant advantage
was observed (HR: 0.74; p value: 0.067).
BV benefit was observed either in patients with a
high tumor grading and low tumor grading (high grading:
HR: 0.76; p value: 0.000; low grade: HR:0.71; p value:
0.007), but it is remarkable that ICON7 data showed no
benefit in those patients expressing lower tumor grading.
Performance status 1-2 patients benefited from BV
(HR: 0.68; p value: 0.000), while patients with PS 0 didn´t
show significant advantage (HR: 0.87; p value: 0.103).
In newly diagnosed OC, BV was linked to higher
risk for events such as bleeding (RR = 3.63; p = 0.000),
ATE (RR = 2.29; p = 0.003), hypertension of grade ≥ 2
(RR = 4.90; p = 0.000), GIP (RR = 2.90; p = 0.003), and
with proteinuria grade ≥3 (RR = 6.63; p = 0.000).
The results in term of PFS and OS in the two dose
groups were very similar (16.5 ms with 7.5 mg/kg and
15.6 ms with 15 mg/kg; HR = 1.04 for PFS; HR = 1.15
for OS).
In the GOG218 trial patients treated with the dose
of 15 mg/kg of BV experienced a worse toxicity profile
than patients treated with 7.5 mg/kg of BV in ICON7
trial: hypertension ≥ 2 (p = 0.003), GIP ≥ 2 (p = 0.028),
proteinuria ≥ 3 (p = 0.017). Patients treated with lower
dose of BV showed a higher rate of ATE (p = 0.000) , with
wound-healing infections and complications (p = 0.001)
than with the higher dose (15 mg/kg).
Four trials involving BV in OC were analyzed in a
more recent meta-analysis [37], which confirmed that BV,
in first line treatment, significantly extended PFS (HR =
0.82) and OS (HR = 0.86). In second-line BV extended
PFS (HR = 0.48), but did not enhanced OS (HR = 0.93).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In another meta-analysis [38], Jun Li investigated
on the effects of antiangiogenetic therapy in OC patients
in terms of survival. This study was developed according
to a pool of 12 clinical trials, including 4 phase III trials
involving BV. Subgroup analyses were conducted, basing
on the anti-angiogenesis agents, and they showed that
administration of BV, considering together the results
of first and second line treatment, was related with an
increased PFS but not OS (HR: 0.90; p value:0.08).
With regard to toxicity, Ranpura [39] evaluated
Phase II or III randomised controlled trials that compared
BV in association with targeted therapy or chemotherapy
versus placebo or best supportive care in association with
targeted therapy or chemotherapy. Unfavourable outcome
of interest was incidence of fatal AEs (FAEs).
The trials selected investigated patients with
several solid tumors. Patients received 2.5mg/kg or
5mg/kg BV per week along with any of the following
treatments:
irinotecan,
fluorouracil,
leucovorin,
oxaliplatin, capecitabine, paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin,
gemcitabine, docetaxel, pemetrexed, interferon alpha and
erlotinib.
Subgroup analyses were undertaken by treatment
dose, trial date, tumor type and chemotherapy regimens.
Sixteen RCTs (10216 patients) were included in the
review: four phase II trials and 12 phase III trials. Median
length of follow-up varied significantly, ranging from 6.7
to 28 months. The overall incidence of FAEs with BV was
2.5%. Bevacizumab addition was related with a consistent
safety problem, for the increased risk of FAEs compared
to standard therapy alone, with an RR of 1.46 (p = 0.01).
No statistically significant differences,between
patients receiving high- or low-dose BV (p = 0.16), in
risk of FAEs were observed. Moreover the authors did not
observed statistically significant variation in risk of FAEs
by tumour type (p = 0.13). This association depended on
chemotherapeutic agents employed (p = 0.045).
Taxanes or platinum agents were related to an
increased occurrence of FAEs with BV (RR = 3.49; p =
0.006) but risk increase was observed when they were
used with other agents (RR = 0.85). The most common
ones were the following: neutropenia (12.2%), GIP (7.1%)
hemorrhage (23.5%). There was no significant association
with year of trial starting. Addition of BV to chemotherapy
or biological therapy increased treatment-related mortality
compared to standard treatment without BV.
Hongxin Huang [40] investigated on the role of
BV in the risk of FAEs in patients with solid tumors.
In NSCLC (RR = 1.88), pancreatic cancer (RR = 1.83),
prostate cancer (RR = 3.34) and OC (RR = 2.35) a higher
occurrence of FAEs was shown.
According to subgroup analyses,based on different
doses of BV was performed, with no significant difference
among dose schedules regarding risk of FAEs (p value:
0.90). Another evaluation according to subgroup analysis
was stratified selecting the chemotherapeutic agents used

COST-EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIONS

in association with BV. Trials were divided into two arms:
chemotherapy with platinum and chemotherapy without
using platinum. RR of BV in association with platinum
was 1.54 vs 1.15 for non-platinum.
All the trials were further divided into two arms:
taxanes and chemotherapy without them. RR with BV
associated with taxanes was 1.60 vs a value of 1.14 for
non-taxanes. Significant higher risk of toxicity was
observed with the association of BV and platinum/taxanes
chemotherapy with a RR of 3.57 (p value: 0.005).
In conclusion, these meta-analyses suggested that
in OC patients chemotherapy and BV regimen followed
by BV significantly in frontline setting lead to improving
of PFS and OS; in recurrent OC an increase in PFS was
observed.
Furthermore, considering toxicity and price, these
meta-analyses found that cost-effectiveness was better in
patients treated with the lower dose of BEV (7.5 mg/kg)
than the dose of 15 mg/kg in first line treatment.Toxicities
were similar in all kind of tumors [41-46].
However, the occurrence of FAEs could be more
frequently in OC, both for comparison with other types of
cancer and for schedule of chemotherapy most frequently
used.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

All oncologists claim a study with clinical
advantages for women suffering from OC, considering
the costs of treatment as a secondary problem.Unluckily,
the financial coast of cancer care reached more than $90
billion annually [47]. Beyond this, the advantage of adding
BV to standard OC treatment is not so clear, because it´s
based on the PFS, that is an end point which depends on
the measure adopted to evaluate the treatment’s efficacy.
Moreover, the cost-benefit analysis of new drugs and
therapies must consider economical costs other than
efficacy and tolerability. Therefore, it is more and more
important to obtain cancer therapies not only efficacious,
but also cost-effective (CE) [48-52]. Furthermore, the most
investigated and standard measurement was the ICER
system ( incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ) considered
as the cost of the therapy for life-year saved (LYS) using
the following equation: ICER = (costA - costB)/(efficacyA
- efficacyB).
Regarding the GOG218 study, in a recent costs
analysis, the estimation of the drugs costs were calculated
by using medicare system reimbursement, including costs
due to BV, chemotherapeutic drugs, supportive treatments,
infusional expenses, and including the cost deriving from
12397

Oncotarget

other kinds of clinical approach ( for example : surgical
and medical care for GIP ). For all patients treated in
GOG218 trial, considering the PFS and GIP at the baseline
estimates, the ICER was $479,712 per progression-free
LYS (PF-LYS) for PCBV and $401,088 per PF-LYS for
PCBV-BV [53].
In their evaluation, Cohn et al, using the GOG218
data, tested differing BV prices to determine the ideal
cost to reach cost effectiveness; anyhow, only at a price
of 25% of the actual BV cost does the ICER dip below
$100,000 per PF-LYS [54]. Therefore, the use of BV
associated to chemotherapy in locally advanced and
metastatic OC patients was not CE. Regarding GOG218,
Hensley ML et al highlighted that the authors provide a
simplified cost-effectiveness analysis because the analysis
does not consider any indirect costs, except these for
management of GIP. Moreover, it´s considerable that
most of these analyses evaluate the costs of improvements
in OS or quality-adjusted OS comparing results with a
standard limit for what may be considered CE: $50,000
per LYS or, more recently, $100,000 per LYS [55].
Furthermore, the use of PFS as key parameter in CE
analysis presumes that 3.8 months of progression-free time
were a concrete benefit for patients. Anyhow, CA125 and
periodic instrumental evaluation are employed because
the large part of recurrent OC are found in absence of
symptoms. Therefore, the advantage of 3.8 months in
radiographically progression free does not mean that BV
improve patient’s QoL. Moreover, considering the absence
of any improvement in OS by BV, the cost effectiveness
of PCBV-BV is not reaching the limit of acceptability.
Only if PFS with PCBV-BV would be 32.1 months did
the ICER approach under the cutoff of $100,000 per PFLYS [56].
Chan JK et al, conduced a CE analysis based
on therapy regimens and outcome of ICON7 trial. In
ICON7 study, the use of BV at lower-dose and shorterduration could reduce the value of the cost numerator
in the CE equation. They evaluated the ICER in highrisk OC patients with a demonstrated OS benefit (HR =
0.64, p>0.002) [21,56].The limit of this analysis was the
use of a model referring to data deriving from a single
prospective study.Regarding toxicity, authors did not
consider minor complications because of their similarity
between the two treatment groups of the ICON7trial.
Furthermore, this study did not consider costs of following
therapies, additional expences for the patients, other costs
for caregivers. Time lost and other derived financial
efforts from other professional contributions were also
considered. [19-21,58]. Anyhow, the cost of treatment
per cycle were calculated based on Medicare payment
for administration of chemotherapy; and considering
an 8-month advantage in OS, the ICER of BV was
$167,771 per LYS [59]. Considering an option with a
value acceptable for new therapeutic purposes (ICER =
$200,000 per LYS), the ICER of BV is CE [60,61].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mehta DA et al in their three-state Markov analysis
used the ICER as incremental cost for QALY score
derived (Quality adjusted life year ), including QoL and
median PFS. This cost method of analysis considers lower
QoL to establish a decrease in effectiveness. Moreover,
because the potential impact of a new emerging drug in
medical oncology (Biosimilar BV) was also considered,
a 30% price reduction with this agent was calculated.
In GOG218 trial, BEV addition determined an ICER of
approximately $2,420,691/QALY; whereas, in ICON7
trial, ICER resulted in a global cost of $225,515/QALY
[62]. Considering different patient populations for both
the clinical trials, the strategy is cost-ineffective in the
universal pool of patients of GOG218 trial and in the
high-risk subset of individuals of the ICON7 trial [22].
Furthermore, the main improvement with the use of BV
was CE in patients with stage IV disease ( about $ 126,169
/ QALY), Performance status 1 according to ECOG system
($116,575/QALY) and in the sub-group of women with
suboptimal and large residual disease ( $ 122,822/QALY
), as experienced in ICON7 trial [63,64]. In this model,
GOG218 was analyzed including QoL, with the result of
worse ICER in regimens containing BV compared with
those without BV. In ICON7, it´s possible to suppose that
the employ of BV at a reduced dose, could be more CE
than that in GOG218; however, even considering only
the therapy of high risk arm, use of BV did not show to
be CE, with the evidence that the influence of BV costs
is strong [62,65].However, the efficacy of BV is proven
by the better PFS seen in patients treated with PCBV-BV
compared to PC,but the results could be influenced by a
percentage of patients who didn´t respond.More factors
to detect subgroups of responders patients could aid to
reach the aim of demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel
therapeutic like BV [66].
Moreover, a number of studies have shown better
PFS results with consolidation chemotherapy after
cytoreduction and use of adjuvant chemotherapy with
CP for OC.A system was prepared considering the GOG
trials n.178 and n.218. The group 1 was treated with six
cycles of chemotherapy according to CP schedule. Group
2 was treated with six cycles of CP and followed by twelve
cycles of P (CP-P). Group 3 was treated with one cycle
of CP, five cycles of CPBV, and sixteen cycles of BV
(CPBV-BV). Main evaluation parameters of outcome were
: OS, PFS, costs, QoL utility values and complications.
ICER value for CP-P schedule was about $13,402/QALY
gained respect to CP schedule, whereas comparing CPBVBV with CP, ICER value was about $326,530/QALY.
Therefore CPBV-BV schedule appears more expensive
with less efficacy than CP-P schedule., then CP-P seemed
to be the best choice.On the other hand, CPBV-BV would
be the best purpose if it was able to increase OS over CP-P
schedule (6.1 years). According to this experience, BV
maintenance led to worse results in terms of effectiveness
compared to P consolidation, and it resulted more costly.
12398

However, its acceptance was due to not confirmed benefit
in OS in patients treated with extended use of and therapy
related severe neurotoxicity.
Lesnock JL et al, reported an OS of 58 months in
optimal cytoreducted patients ( < 1cm ) and 35 months for
patients with poor residual disease. The samecompromise
was used for PFS evaluation, establishing for optimal
patients and suboptimal patients the values of 24 and 14
months respectively. This model revealed that CPBVBV is more expensive, with less efficacy, than CP-P.
Considering these data, CPBV-BV would never become
the CE in terms of PFS by 10. Regarding OS, CPBV-BV
would be the best CE option if the OS would be improved
of 6.1 years beyond baseline CP-P improvement. If the
total costs of CPBV-BV reach a value below 37% of the
total expenses, ICER score would lower below the value
of $100,000 respect to the CP schedule, while the best
option is still CP-P schedule.The total cost of CPBVBV schedule might be less than 12% to gain the CE
preference. Considering an ICER value about $13,402/
QALY for twelve extended cycles of P, the CP-P schedule
is better than CP followed by BV consolidation in terms of
CE.In order to affirm the role of biological therapy in OC
treatment, survival advantages might be supported by an
improvement of CE balance. [67].

in both studies, women were treated with BV for the
period determined in each studies and not until disease
progression. Although no differences in OS have been
shown in both studies, a subgroup analysis of these trials
demonstrated an advantage in the high risk patients; in
GOG218, IV stage patients receiving BV, showed better
OS results (40.6 months in TCBV arm vs 32.8 in TCP arm,
HR = 0.73); in ICON7 trial, high risk patients showed a
median value of OS of 30.3 ms in TC arm and 39.7 ms in
TCBV arm (HR = 0.64, p = 0.002).
However, the absolute mPFS improvement with
the use in first-line of BV associated to chemotherapy
and followed by extended treatment was 3.8 months
(seeGOG218), and 1.5 months (ICON 7). Assessment of
PFS was performed in GOG218 trial using both CA125
marker and radiologic evidence of progressive disease.
Censoring CA125 elevations, the PFS difference increases
to 6.0 months. According to ICON7 and GOG218 results
, it appears that the PFS difference was smaller in the first
study, probably due to the choice of using a lower dose
(7.5 mg/kg) of BV ; nevertheless we must also consider
that in ICON7 study the patients recruited had a better
prognostic profile than in GOG218 study. The difference
in PFS was not significant in recurrent OC, showing a
value of 4 months being 4 months in platinum-sensitive
relapsed OC (OCEANS trial) and 3.3 months in platinumresistant OC (AURELIA trial) [19,20].
AURELIA trial observed a statistically significant
3.3 month improvement in PFS, very similar to the value
observed other different studies (ICON7, OCEANS and
GOG218 studies), which confirmed an important role
of the association of BV with chemotherapy in different
groups of OC patients [19,20]. Nevertheless, according to
the results of other randomized trials, none benefit in terms
of OS was observed (13.7 months) in BV arm, considering
the median OS of approximately 12 months observed
in patients with platinum-resistant tumor. Instead, the
association of chemotherapy and BV in AURELIA trial
has shown to improve significantly ORR from 11.8% to
27.3% (p = 0.001) (similar to the OCEANS trial).
AURELIA trial seem to confirm that there are strong
evidences supporting the possibility to improve the clinical
outcome in OC, justifying treatment of ovarian cancer
with a prolonged use of BV, mostly in patients requiring a
palliation without unacceptable toxicity.
Tomao et al [68] criticized the use of BV in
conjunction with paclitaxel in Aurelia trial, because
all patients received one or two lines of treatment with
taxanes, and it would have been better to use another drug
active in OC. Furthermore, they said that in several metaanalyses BV therapy, associated with paclitaxel/docetaxel,
was characterized by higher toxicity than in association
with other chemotherapeutic drugs and advised against the
use of taxanes in association with BV in second- or thirdline chemotherapy in platinum-resistant and recurrent OC
patients.

CONCLUSIONS
This review could help the clinicians to receive
the most updated evidences concerning the use of
Bevacizumab in OC, suggesting future developments
too in this emerging area of investigation. Main
differences between the two studies in first line treatment
of OC patients were the following: eligibility criteria,
investigational arms, drug dosing and duration of
maintenance, cross-over possibility.
Regarding eligibility criteria, while in GOG218
only III and IV staging patients were enrolled, in ICON7
also women with stage I-IIA (with clear cell histology
and/or grading 3) and stage IIB have been included
[21,22]. Furthermore, in GOG218 there were three arms
of treatment, considering TC, TCP and TCBV arms; in
ICON7 only TC and TCBV arms were considered because
no placebo control was provided. Bevacizumabwas
administered at different doses inclinicaltrials: 15 mg/
kg (GOG218 trial) and 7.5 mg/kg (ICON7 trial). No
differences in PFS and OS were observed between the two
doses of BV; furthermore, 15 mg/kg dose was linked to
a higher frequency of AEs (mainly proteinuria and GIP).
In GOG218, there was no advantage in OS, probably for
the possibility to use crossover strategy, but similar same
result has been shown in ICON7, in which cross-over was
not allowed; maybe 7.5 mg/kg could not represent a right
dose to give survival advantage in first line.
The duration of maintenance was 15 months in
GOG218 and 12 months in ICON7. It is noteworthy that,

Aurelia trial authors [69] replied that these
observations are in contrast with results deriving from
other experiences that suggest that paclitaxel is a highly
active and well-tolerated regimen in a weekly schedule in
relapsed OC patients, inducing significant RR in women
with paclitaxel resistant disease given every 21 days;
the authors also showed in the AURELIA’s exploratory
analyses, that paclitaxel adminestered with a weekly
schedule was able to give a high RR and a long mPFS,
compared with PLD or topotecan. No deaths were
documented in the cohort of pts treated with BV associated
to weekly paclitaxel schedule.
Occurrence of peripheral sensory neuropathy may
occur more frequently after prolonged treatment with
chemotherapy; this toxicity may also be increased in case
of extended therapy with BV and weekly paclitaxel, when
a prolonged and persistent PFS, require to continue the
treatment until progression or toxicity.
In the study patients were stratified according to
different chemotherapeutic schedules by without specific
randomization. The study indicated that mPFS improved
significantly associating BV to chemotherapy in all
three different groups of treatment. HRs were 0.46 in
the paclitaxel cohort (10.4 v 3.9 months), 0.57 in PLD
cohort (5.4 v 3.5 months), and 0.32 in topotecan cohort
(5.8 months v 2.1 months). A higher ORR was observed
in patients treated when BV was associated to paclitaxel
(53.3% vs 30.2%) and topotecan (17.0% vs 0.0%); a lower
advantage was shown with the association of BV and PLD
(13.7% vs 7.8%). No significant different results in mOS
was found between treatment arms for PLD (13.7 months
with BV-CT vs 14.1 with CT alone; HR = 0.91) and for
topotecan (13.8 months v 13.3 months; HR = 1.09). Better
clinical results in terms of OS were observed in patients
treated with paclitaxel and BV (22.4 v 13.2 months; HR
= 0.65). In all the three cohorts of treatment the rates of
cross-over from chemotherapy to BV was similar (with
paclitaxel: 38%; with PLD: 39%; with topotecan: 41%).
Different trials in metastatic breast cancer revealed
that BV associated to weekly paclitaxel is an effective
and safe schedule. Several studies confirm that this
combination may be more efficient than the association
with other drugs [70]; in the past some exploratory studies
showed that the combination of BV and paclitaxel could
enhance antiangiogenic effects of BV. Unfortunately,
in the GOG-262 trial this attractive hypothesis was not
investigated [71]; while in Aurelia trial the use and the role
of paclitaxel administered with a weekly schedule remains
an investigational therapeutic strategy [63,72].
Important limitations of these studies are the
following: randomization procedures, different prognostic
factors among the patients recruited in different trials,
disease related different profiles. Certainly, these factors
and not homogeneous patient characteristics could have
influenced chemotherapy selection in the different trials.
However, according to results of the study, there is full
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

evidence supporting favourable effects on PFS, ORR, and
OS with the association of BV with weekly paclitaxel.
There were no differences in OS between the two groups,
but we must consider that in the study crossover to BV
was accepted without restrictions from chemotherapy
groups and occurred in a large number of patients (about
40%).Another critical point of the study is the following:
a BV-alone arm was not available reducing the possibility
to analyze BV activity in an off-chemotherapy arm.
In 113 patients (31%) experiencing ascites, 9 (17%) in
chemotherapy arm and one (2%) in BV-chemotherapy
arm underwent paracentesis from beginning of therapy.
Although no benefit in mPFS was observed in all the
patients (with or without ascites at baseline), the results
suggest that the use of BV improved control of ascites.
Patient-reported outcomes were analyzed using the
EORTC QLQ-OV28 , given to the patients at baseline,
after two or three cycles and until tumor progression [65].
Analyses compared the proportion of patients experiencing
≥ 15% improvement after 8 or 9 week of treatment and
evaluating abdominal and GI symptoms scores. This
benefit was major in BV-CT than CT group (21.9% v
9.3%; p = 0.002).The reached benefit was 25.0% vs 13.0%
in the paclitaxel group, 20.0% vs 8.8% in the topotecan
group and 21.1% vs 6.8% in the PLD group. These results
may underestimate the PRO improvement BV, in fact 1/3
of patients had symptoms at baseline evaluation
AURELIA must to be considered the first study,
investigating the role of BV in OC, to demonstrate a
statistically significant improvement in PROs.
GOG 218 trial was not able to confirm the Aurelia’s
results in terms of improvement in PROs and ICON7
demonstrated slightly worse PROs [73,74]. In fact, in first
line settings, most patients reported few disease-related
symptoms at the beginning of chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, OCEANS trial did not investigated as
end point the PROs evaluation.
Furthermore, it is possible that the open-label
characteristics of study design could have determined
this bias. Moreover patients enrolled in the BV-CT arm
could have reported more favorable PROs, because of the
knowledge of receiving an additional drug.
Another critical issue about PROs is that earlyprogressed patients were not regularly evaluated in order
to analyze PROs after 8 or 9 week of treatment , resulting
therefore in a larger number of patients not receiving
regular PRO comparative analysis both in the control and
experimental arms.As a consequence of this clinical bias,
effective rates in PRO benefit between the arms treated
with BV and chemotherapy and the arms treated only
with chemotherapy gave decreased and not statistically
significant values .
About Oceans trial, Tomao et al [75] observed
that the improvement in PFS wasnot able to generate an
advantage in terms of OS and QoL. The choose of select
PFS as the only criterion useful to identify the value
12400

of novel therapeutic strategies is wrong. According to
positive predictive CA-125 value and modifications in
many patients before the radiologic response, the use of
CA-125 detection could be a correct strategy to assess and
identify disease progression in clinical trial investigating
innovative therapeutic protocols in recurrent OC .
GCI (Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup) suggested
novel parameters in order to evaluate disease progression
(during therapy) and recurrence (after treatment), stressing
and underlining the necessity of evaluating strategic data
(CA-125, CA-125 alone, HE4, symptoms, only RECIST
criteria) in order to optimally develop therapy in patients
experiencing stable measurable disease but with a CA-125
constant rising [76].
Other authors (Aghajanian et Coll), did not use
Ca125 as a predictive factor of response to therapy without
including results suggestive for biomarker modifications.
Patients received BV until progression or unacceptable
toxicity; RECIST criteria, used alone as eligibility criteria
of inclusion and as predictive factor of response to therapy
could produce negative suggestions, prolonging in an
inappropriate way an inefficient therapy, with expensive
costs and little improvement by clinical point of view.
GOG 213 reached the average survival beyond 40
months in patients with recurrent disease.
Indeed, many open questions are emerging about
the role of BV in OC and many doubts still deserve clear
explanations. [77].
Should BV be used alone or associated with
chemotherapy? Is use of BV as single-agentless toxic in
all the patients? Is it extended and maintenance therapy an
effective part of front-line treatment?
Regarding duration of BV, an extended therapy
could be associated with an improved clinical benefit but,
at same time, with higher costsand greater toxicity.
AURELIA and ICON7 were two important and
attractive not placebo-controlled trials suggestive for
potential bias in the evaluation of toxicity and activity.
Moreover, in trials investigating the role of BV in recurrent
disease patients received BV until toxicity or progression,
whereas in the two first-line trials women were treated
with BV for 15 and 12 months. This difference could
explain the lower safety profile in relapsed patients.
Open questions include also the potential alternative
use of BV in integrated therapy for OC; intraperitoneal
chemotherapy plays still an experimental role like as
dose-dense chemotherapy; the optimal dose of BV and its
role in patients with BRCA mutations that can be treated
with olaparib, the role of BV in patients with platinumsensitive OC and in competition with olaparib and other
PARP inhibitors, with still conflicting data in progress.
Patients with high-grade serous OC could receive a
VEGF-directed therapy like a PARPi for treatment;
different studies support the combination of VEGF
inhibitors with PARPi [78]. In AURELIA and OCEANS
trials, PFS and QoL (clearly improved in AURELIA)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrate the significant clinical benefit of adding BV
to chemotherapy in relapsed disease.The OS improvement
in stage IV patients enrolled in GOG218 and in patients
with elevated risk of relapse in ICON7 trialare consistent
with the probability that BV is able to increase the clinical
outcome in patients with OC. We can absolutely conclude
that adding BV to chemotherapy could increasetumor
control in OC,both in first-line therapy and in case of
relapse disease.
However, the results of studies including BV have
not showed improvementin OS for eitherprimary or
relapsed disease; considering the high cost associated with
this treatment, it is necessary to select patients carefully.
Several phase II and III trials are currently ongoing
to evaluate the role of BV in several settings of patients
(Table 4 and Table 5).
Therefore, valid predictive biomarkers are an
important issue to maximize the efficacy of BV in the
treatment of OC [79, 80].
