BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws (BP-ONJ) is a relatively new disease.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of BP-ONJ in breast cancer patients with osseous metastasis and bisphosphonate therapy. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a EUSOMA
accredited breast unit in Germany. All patients treated from January of 2000 to March of 2006 with metastatic breast cancer and bisphosphonate therapy were reviewed. All patients were contacted, and missing
data were completed through structured interviews with their dentists and physicians (n ¼ 75). Primary
outcome was the development of BP-ONJ and the detection of possible additional trigger factors for the
development of BP-ONJ. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients with breast cancer fulfilled the inclusion criteria,
and data for 75 still living patients were included. Of these 75, 4 patients developed a BP-ONJ, resulting in
a prevalence of 5.3%: 3 patients received zoledronate only; 1 patient had first pamidronate followed by
zoledronate and ibandronate. A tooth extraction could be identified as an additional trigger factor for 2
patients. CONCLUSIONS: With a prevalence of 5.3%, BP-ONJ in breast cancer patients has become a relevant disease that should be discussed with patients for whom bisphosphonates have been recommended.
Appropriate dental care before bisphosphonate therapy commences has been advised to reduce the

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in women
worldwide. The skeleton is the most frequent site of distant metastasis in breast cancer patients.1 The metastases cause severe morbidity including pain, impaired mobility, hypercalcemia, pathological fractures,
spinal cord compression, and bone marrow infiltration.2
Bisphosphonates play an important role in the therapy of breast cancer patients with osseous metastases.
Depending on the ligands, bisphosphonates are separated into nitrogen-containing and non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. The former inhibit the mevalonate pathway, and the latter are integrated into the
ATP molecule. Both mechanisms result in a cytotoxic effect on the osteoclasts.3,4 There is further evidence

that bisphosphonates reduce and delay skeletal-related
events and reduce pain and thereby improve quality of life.1
Further effects of bisphosphonates are listed in Table 1.
Adverse side effects are acute-phase-reactions, affection of the upper aerodigestive tract and renal toxicity.5 In
2003, a new adverse side effect was described for the first
time6 and has since increased in frequency, probably due
to increased awareness, namely bisphosphonate associated
osteonecrosis of the jaws (BP-ONJ).7 At first, causality
was questioned and the appearance of the osteonecrosis
was explained by the higher incidence of osteonecrosis already associated with cancer patients, radiation, chemotherapy, co-medications such as steroids, infections of
dental or sinus origin, dental procedures, anemia, and
local anesthetics with vasoconstrictor.8 Recently, BP-ONJ
has been included in the summary of product
characteristics.
Patients with BP-ONJ mainly suffer from pain and
infection of the soft tissue and the bone. In general, the
bone is exposed to the oral cavity or a fistula can be
detected. Usually these patients have an additional trigger
factor such as previous tooth extraction, surgical dental
procedures, periodontal diseases with odontososis, or denture pressure sores.7 There is evidence that patients with
an additional risk factor for osteonecrosis, such as radiation of the head and neck area, have an increased risk of
developing BP-ONJ.9

Regarding pathogenesis, several theories are being discussed. In addition to the death of osteoclasts with consequential reduced bone remodeling,10 the antiangiogenetic
potency and the development of an avascular bone necrosis,11
and the impact of bisphosphonates on the mucosal layer over
a proapoptotic effect on keratinocytes are implicated.12
Because bone remodeling is affected by bisphosphonates, a typical radiological sign in dental x-rays is persistent alveolar sockets.13
Therapy for the manifest BP-ONJ is difficult.14,15
Depending on the stage of the disease, therapy ranges
from mouth rinses, debridement, to huge resections of the
affected area with a broad influence on the quality of life
for these patients. Independent from any form of therapy
mastication, the possibility of wearing dentures and nutritional intake are affected. The incidence, prevalence, and
etiology of the BP-ONJ and risk factors triggering BPONJ are largely unknown. In most BP-ONJ case series
and case reports, the authors report a previous dental surgical procedure.7,16 Therefore, guidelines have been established that recommend introducing patients to a dentist
or an oral and maxillofacial surgeon before bisphosphonate therapy starts, with the goal of restoring and/ or
extracting teeth before treatment. This regimen is already
routinely practice for patients with forthcoming radiation.17 Only a few studies have been published about BPONJ in breast cancer patients. The study by Durie et al

was a Web-based survey without strictly defined inclusion
criteria and, therefore, may be hampered by events-based
bias.18 The studies of Bamias et al19 and Wang et al20
reported an incidence of 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively.
Aguiar Bujanda et al21 describe in a smaller study 4 BPONJ cases out of 35 breast cancer patients receiving
zoledronate only, resulting in an incidence of 11.4%.
Sanna et al22 report an incidence of 6.2% in breast cancer
patients receiving pamidronate and zoledronate. Overall,
the available amount of data regarding BP-ONJ compared with the widespread use of bisphosphonates seems
remarkably sparse. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study in a dedicated breast unit. Our aim was to
evaluate the prevalence of BP-ONJ and to investigate predictive or prognostic factors that might be related to the
development of the BP-ONJ.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was performed at the breast unit
of the HSK, Dr. Horst Schmidt Hospital, Wiesbaden,
Germany. The protocol was approved by the local ethics
committee (837.099.06 (5197)), and every patient gave
written informed consent.
Data were primarily derived from the in-house cancer registry. All patients treated in the breast unit from
January 2000 to March 2006 with breast cancer were
identified. Patients with osseous metastasis and
bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled. The living patients
were contacted by mail and, if the patient agreed, by
phone. Further information was extracted from the medical records. Additional data were gained by structured
interview with the family physicians and dentists of
patients who agreed. Data collected included age, breast
cancer characteristics, applied bisphosphonate, co-morbidity and co-medication, radiation of the head and neck
area, and dentist consultation frequency. Due to its retrospective character, statistical analysis was restricted to a descriptive analysis only.

RESULTS
A total of 117 patients with osseous metastases due to
breast cancer were identified and 88 were still alive at the
time of this analysis. Thirteen patients could not be
included because they either refused participation or we
failed to locate them. All together, 75 patients (64.1% of
the 117 patients) with a median age of 60 years (range,
Cancer

April 15, 2009

30-92 years) could be included. The median age at breast
cancer diagnosis was 58 years (range, 27-89 years). Median duration of bisphosphonate therapy was 28 months
(range, 6 months to 93 months). Bisphosphonates were
either given orally or applied intravenously every 3 or 4
weeks. The bisphosphonates administered were as follows:
exclusively zoledronate in 26 patients, exclusively coldronate in 24 patients, exclusively ibandronate in 7 patients,
and exclusively pamidronate only in 3 patients. Seven
more patients had combinations of different bisphosphonates sequentially with zoledronate. The other 8 patients
had different bisphosphonate combinations but without
zoledronate (Table 2).
Of 75 patients, 4 developed a BP-ONJ (5.3%). In
these patients, the bisphosphonate had been applied for a
median of 42 months (range, 16 months to 74 months).
In all BP-ONJ cases, zoledronate had been used. One of
the BP-ONJ patients had also received pamidronate and
ibandronate sequentially (Table 3). In contrast, no patient
receiving clodronate only developed BP-ONJ in our
cohort.
All affected patients had received prior chemotherapy, whereas patients without prior chemotherapy in our
cohort did not develop BP-ONJ. Eighteen patients were
treated with aromatase inhibitors only, 4 patients received
antiestrogens, 43 patients received aromatase inhibitors
and antiestrogens sequentially, and 10 patients had no
additional endocrine therapy. All patients with BP-ONJ
had a treatment consisting of sequential tamoxifen and
aromatase inhibitors.
One BP-ONJ patient had melanoma and renal
insufficiency. None of the BP-ONJ patients had prior
radiation of the head and neck region, 2 of the affected
patients reported prior smoking.
Two patients with BP-ONJ were treated in the
Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in the
HSK, Dr. Horst Schmidt Hospital, Wiesbaden. A patient
with necrosis in the maxilla had a hemimaxillectomy and
developed half a year later relapse and had an extended
second resection of the maxilla. In the second patient, a
partial resection of the left mandible was planned, but the
patient cancelled the appointment and was lost to followup. The third patient did not have infected osteonecrosis
in the mandible and was treated without surgery. The
fourth patient was lost to follow-up shortly after BP-ONJ
diagnosis.

DISCUSSION
This study was conducted for evaluation of the prevalence
of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw
(BP-ONJ) in breast cancer patients treated with
bisphosphonate in a tertiary breast center.
Of 75 breast cancer patients, 4 developed BP-ONJ,
resulting in a prevalence of 5.3%. These findings are a
higher than most of the reported incidences in the literature of 2.9 % (2 of 7019), 4.3 % (13 of 29918) and 2,5 %
1634

(2 of 8120). A reason for this higher incidence in our
cohort might be that anticancer therapy such as chemotherapy or endocrine therapy was different in our population. Of interest, all our affected patients had not only
received bisphosphonate therapy but also had been
administered prior chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors. Both chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors have a
negative impact on the bone mineral density.23,24 Therefore, an additional impact on the risk for BP-ONJ cannot

be ruled out. Unfortunately, anticancer medication
accompanying bisphosphonate therapy had not been fully
reported in most other series.
The study by Sanna et al22 reports a little higher incidence possibly because of the study design. It was a prospective study, and every patient had an oral examination so that
even asymptomatic BP-ONJ cases were recorded.
The bisphosphonates that are related to BP-ONJ development in other studies were nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonates such as zoledronate, pamidronate, and
ibandronate.6,7 This observation was also true in our
cohort. All affected patients had been administered
zoledronate, the most potent bisphosphonate. However,
our trial was not designed to compare BP-ONJ risks
among different bisphosphonates, and conclusions should
be withheld until prospective comparisons have been performed. The bisphosphonates used in this study are typically used in breast cancer patients.1
In 3 of the 4 BP-ONJ patients, the osteonecrosis

often affected. This observation had been explained by the
more critical blood perfusion of the mandible compared
with the maxilla25 and the antiangiogenetic effect of the
bisphosphonates.26 In 2 of the patients, a previous tooth
extraction shortly preceded the onset of BP-ONJ, a phenomenon that has been described as a risk factor several
times.7,11 Because the possible adverse effects of
bisphosphonates are not really well known, there might be
no difference as to whether a patient developed BP-ONJ
due to a tooth extraction or to periodontal disease. Awareness of BP-ONJ on behalf of the bisphosphonate-prescribing or -applying physicians and dentists could
reasonably lead to prevention.
No potential dental status-related additional risk
factors could be identified in the 2 other patients with BPONJ. However, no prospective dental evaluation had
been performed prospectively. Predispositions for BPONJ might have been missed in these 2 patients, thus
underlining the limitation of retrospective studies as
always bearing the potential of missing data. Furthermore,
the latter accounts not only for potential prognostic or
1635

Original Article

predictive factors, we may have also missed BP-ONJ cases
because we could not contact all patients, especially those
who had already died.
The incidence of BP-ONJ in breast cancer patients
seems to be lower than in patients with prostate cancer or
patients with multiple myeloma, with reported incidence
rates ranging from 3.8% to 11.0% (Table 4). This first
observations might suggest that not only co-medication
but also the underlying malignant disease may influence
the occurrence of BP-ONJ. However, non-cancer-related
patient characteristics might add to different incidence
rates in different populations, eg, breast cancer patients on
average are younger compared with patients with prostate
cancer (around 70 years of age).27 Age (and gender) had
been reported as prognostic factors for treatment needs
for conservative dental treatment, tooth extractions, and
prostheses.28 Younger and female patients may have better
motivation or manual abilities needed for oral hygiene.
Thus, better oral hygiene may suggest fewer possible trigger factors for the development of BP-ONJ in younger
women, resulting in a lower prevalence of BP-ONJ.
Further prospectively designed subprojects associated with prospective trials evaluating bisphosphonates
should focus on BP-ONJ to better define risk populations
and strategies for prevention.
