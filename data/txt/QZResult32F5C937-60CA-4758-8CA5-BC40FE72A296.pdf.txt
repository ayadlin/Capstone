ABSTRACT
Drug resistance is a major hurdle in anticancer chemotherapy. Combined therapy
using drugs with distinct mechanisms of function may increase anticancer efficacy.
We have recently identified the novel chalcone derivative, chalcone-24 (Chal-24),
as a potential therapeutic that kills cancer cells through activation of an autophagymediated necroptosis pathway. In this report, we investigated if Chal-24 can be
combined with the frontline genotoxic anticancer drug, cisplatin for cancer therapy.
The combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin synergistically induced apoptotic cytotoxicity
in lung cancer cell lines, which was dependent on Chal-24-induced autophagy. While
cisplatin slightly potentiated the JNK/Bcl2/Beclin1 pathway for autophagy activation,
its combination with Chal-24 strongly triggered proteasomal degradation of the cellular
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (c-IAPs) and formation of the Ripoptosome complex that
contains RIP1, FADD and caspase 8. Furthermore, the cisplatin and Chal-24 combination
induced dramatic degradation of cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme)inhibitory protein large (cFLIPL) which suppresses Ripoptosome-mediated apoptosis
activation. These results establish a novel mechanism for potentiation of anticancer
activity with the combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin: to enhance apoptosis signaling
through Ripoptosome formation and to release the apoptosis brake through c-FLIPL
degradation. Altogether, our work suggests that the combination of Chal-24 and
cisplatin could be employed to improve chemotherapy efficacy.

of anticancer drugs, thereby causing therapy failure [2,

combines drugs with distinct mechanisms of function,
would significantly increase anticancer efficacy.
Two major apoptosis activation pathways exist.
The extrinsic pathway is activated through the ligation
of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokines to their
respective receptors initiating formation of the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) [7, 8]. Intracellular
stresses activate the intrinsic pathway that involves loss
of mitochondrial potential and release of mitochondrial
proteins such as cytochrome C and SMAC to form the
apoptosome consisting of cytochrome C, APAF-1 and
caspase 9. Many anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin,
activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through DNA
damage and genotoxic stress [9, 10]. Recently, it was
found that genotoxic anticancer therapeutics such as
etoposide induce an alternative apoptosis pathway
that involves formation of a complex called the
Ripoptosome, consisting of RIP1, FADD, and caspase
8 [11, 12]. This pathway is likely activated through
degradation of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (c-IAPs) [11, 12]. The activation of caspase
8 in the Ripoptosome is negatively regulated by
cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme)inhibitory protein large (cFLIPL), and thus, suppressing
cFLIPL would promote Ripoptosome-mediated apoptosis
[11, 13]. Additionally, autophagy, a catabolic process
for degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and
organelles, can also lead to apoptotic cell death [14, 15].
Thus, these apoptosis activating pathways could be
exploited for chemosensitization.
Our recent work has suggested the novel chalcone
derivative, Chal-24, as a potential anticancer agent
[16, 17]. Without obvious signs of toxicity in nude
mice, Chal-24 potently inhibited xenografted human
tumor growth [16]. At relatively high concentrations
(> 4 μM), Chal-24 activates autophagy through JNKmediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, leading
to disruption of the Beclin1/Bcl-2 and Beclin1/Bcl-xL
complexes, with subsequent degradation of the c-IAP
proteins and formation of the Ripoptosome complex,
resulting in necroptosis in cancer cells [17]. However, at
lower concentrations (≤ 1 μM) Chal-24 mainly induces
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [17, 18]. The potential use
of Chal-24 in combination with other anticancer drugs in
chemotherapy has not been explored.
In this study, we hypothesized that due to their
distinct cytotoxic mechanisms, Chal-24 and cisplatin
would synergistically kill cancer cells. We found that
the combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin synergistically
increased cytotoxicity, which was associated with autophagymediated apoptosis. While cisplatin slightly potentiated
autophagy activation, its combination with Chal-24
strongly enhanced proteasomal degradation of c-IAPs
and formation of the Ripoptosome complex. Furthermore,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the cisplatin and Chal-24 combination induced dramatic
degradation of the Ripoptosome-inhibiting factor, c-FLIPL.
Our results establish a novel mechanism for potentiation
of anticancer activity with the combination of Chal-24
and cisplatin: to enhance apoptosis signaling through
Ripoptosome formation and to release the apoptosis brake
through c-FLIPL degradation. Data from this study suggest
that the combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin could be
employed to improve chemotherapy efficacy.

RESULTS
Combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin results in
synergistic apoptotic cell death in lung cancer cells
To investigate the potential of combination of C
­ hal-24
and cisplatin for chemotherapy, we first treated A549 cells
with increasing concentrations of cisplatin (10–30 μM)
and a fixed concentration of Chal-24 (0.5 μM). Cell
death was detected and quantified by LDH assay. While
treatment with Chal-24 alone at this low concentration
caused little cell death, Chal-24 synergistically potentiated
cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in a cisplatin dosedependent manner (Combination index, CI: 0.5625)
(Fig. 1A). Consistently, a similar synergy was also
observed with increasing concentrations of Chal-24
(0.125–1.0 μM) and a fixed cisplatin dose (10 μM) (CI:
0.375) (Fig. 1B). Because Chal-24 at 1 μM exerted limited
cytotoxicity but effectively potentiated cisplatin-induced
cell death, this concentration of Chal-24 was used for
later experiments. To confirm whether the potentiation of
cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin and Chal-24 combination
is a common phenomenon, three additional human lung
cancer cell lines, H23, H460 and H1299, were tested
under similar conditions. Comparable sensitization
in the anticancer effect was seen in all these cell lines
(Figs. S1A–S1C). Collectively, these results suggest that
Chal-24 and cisplatin synergistically kill lung cancer cells.
Next, we performed a series of experiments
to elucidate the mechanism of cell death induced by
cisplatin and Chal-24 combination. Results from all these
experiments supported that apoptosis was the main cell
death mode: with activation of caspase 3 and cleavage
of PARP (hallmarks of apoptosis) (Figs. 1C, S1D); with
morphological apoptotic features in dead cells detected
by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining
(cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, and nuclear
condensation) (data not shown); Annexin V positive in
the main portion of dead cells (data not shown); and with
effective suppression of cell death by the pan-caspase
inhibitor z-VAD or caspase 9 knockdown (Figs. 1D, 1E,
S1E and S1F). These results suggest that the cisplatin
and Chal-24 combination mainly induces apoptotic
cytotoxicity in cancer cells.

slightly potentiated autophagy (Fig. 2A). Induction of
autophagy by the cisplatin and Chal-24 combination
was further confirmed by an autophagic flux assay
(Fig. 2B). The role of autophagy in cell death induced by
the Chal-24 and cisplatin combination was examined with
the use of different autophagy inhibitors to inhibit different
steps in the autophagy process. All these three inhibitors
significantly suppressed cytotoxicity induced by Chal-24
and cisplatin co-treatment (Figs. 2C and S2). Supporting
this observation, knockdown of the key autophagy
mediator, ATG7, effectively attenuated the cytotoxicity
induced by cisplatin plus Chal-24 (Fig. 2D). These data

We previously found that Chal-24 induces
autophagy-dependent necroptosis at higher concentrations
(8–32 μM) [17]. Therefore, we investigated whether the
combination of cisplatin and a lower concentration of
Chal-24 induces autophagy. Chal-24 at 1 μM evidently
induced autophagy, which was shown as conversion
of LC3I to LC3II (4–24 h) and reduction of p62 (24 h).
While cisplatin alone had little effect on the autophagy
markers, the co-treatment with cisplatin and Chal-24

cytotoxicity depending on Chal-24-induced autophagy.

S3B). Moreover, Chal-24 induced phosphorylation of
Bcl-2 (Figs. 3C, and S3C). Interestingly, the co-treatment
with cisplatin resulted in reduction of phosphorylated Bcl2 (Figs. 3C, 3D, 3E). This was likely due to degradation
of this phosphorylated protein in proteasome, because
phosphorylated Bcl-2 was restored by the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 but not the lysosome inhibitor
chloroquine (Figs. 3D, 3E). Together with previous
studies showing that JNK-mediated phosphorylated Bcl-2
releases Beclin-1 to activate autophagy [17], these results
suggest that the cisplatin and Chal-24 combination induces
cell death dependent on autophagy activation involving
JNK-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of Bcl2. Furthermore, suppression of JNK inhibited autophagy,
caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage induced by
combination of Chal-24 and cisplatin (Fig. S1F and data
not shown), suggesting JNK is involved in autophagymediated apoptosis induced by this drug combination.

Combination of cisplatin and Chal-24 activates
the JNK-mediated autophagy pathway involving
phosphorylation of Bcl-2
Our recent studies showed that Chal-24 induces
autophagy through activation of JNK, phosphorylation
of Bcl-2, and disruption of the Beclin1/Bcl-2 complex
[17]. Therefore, we investigated whether the cisplatin
and Chal-24 combination induces autophagy by the
same mechanism. While cisplatin barely affected JNK
activity, the drug combination induced a higher level of
JNK activation compared to that of Chal-24 alone (Figs.
3A and S3A). Inhibition of JNK effectively suppressed
the cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin and Chal-24 cotreatment in both A549 and H460 cell lines (Figs. 3B,

respectively, then treated with cisplatin (10 μM), Chal-24 (1 μM) or in combination for an additional 8 h. The indicated proteins were
detected by Western blot, GAPDH was detected as an input control.

Combination of cisplatin and Chal-24 induces
ERK-mediated degradation of the IAP proteins

Furthermore, ERK suppression inhibited apoptosis but
not autophagy (data not shown), consisting with that ERK
is involved in IAP suppression but not autophagy [17].
Altogether, these results suggest that combined treatment
with cisplatin and Chal-24 induces ERK-mediated
proteasomal degradation of IAP proteins for promoting
apoptosis.

Our recent studies found that Chal-24 at high
concentrations causes ERK- and autophagy-dependent
degradation of IAPs [17]. Because the IAP family
proteins are important antiapoptotic factors [19–22], we
then examined if the cisplatin and Chal-24 co-treatment
impacts the expression of IAPs. Under the experimental
condition with moderate drug concentrations, cisplatin or
Chal-24 alone had little effect on the expression of cIAP1,
cIAP2 and XIAP. However, the combination of these
two agents dramatically suppressed the expression of
these proteins (Figs. 4A, S4A). The proteasome inhibitor,
MG132, significantly restored the expression of IAPs,
suggesting that the cisplatin and Chal-24 co-treatment
enhanced proteasomal degradation of the IAPs (Figs. 4B
and S4B). Consistent with previous studies [17], Chal24 alone at a lower concentration also activated ERK,
which was slightly increased by cisplatin (Fig. 4C and
S4C). Inhibition of ERK significantly attenuated IAPs
degradation and the cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin
and Chal-24 co-treatment (Figs. 4D, 4E, S4D and S4E).
In addition, cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin and Chal24 co-treatment was substantially attenuated by ectopic
expression of cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP (Fig. 4F).

Combination of cisplatin and Chal-24 triggers
Ripoptosome formation and cFLIPL degradation
Because suppressing expression of cIAPs by
genotoxic drugs or high concentrations of Chal-24 results
in formation of the Ripoptosome complex consisting of
RIP1, FADD, cFLIPL and caspase 8 that mediates cell death
[11–13, 17, 23], we examined, by co-immunoprecipitation
with an anti-RIP1 antibody, if the cisplatin and Chal-24
co-treatment triggers Ripoptosome formation. Under
this condition, Chal-24 but not cisplatin alone induced
the formation of the Ripoptosome. Interestingly, the
co-treatment with cisplatin enhanced the recruitment of
caspase 8 to the Chal-24-induced Ripoptosome (Fig. 5A).
RIP1 is the central factor for Ripoptosome formation
and function [11, 13, 24, 25]. Knockdown of RIP1
expression with siRNA or suppression of RIP1 kinase
activity with Necrostatin-1 significantly suppressed

[11, 26, 27]. Thus, we investigated the effect of Chal-24

1645

cells, cisplatin individually caused a moderate decrease
of cFLIPL expression. However, the co-treatment with
Chal-24 significantly promoted cisplatin-induced c-FLIPL
expression suppression (Fig. 5D). A similar trend for
this effect was also detected in H460 cells, although
cisplatin individually induced decrease of cFLIPL is
more evident at a later time point (24 h, Fig. S5B). The
proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly restored
c-FLIPL expression in cells treated with the Chal-24
and cisplatin combination (Fig. 5E), suggesting the­
co-treatment triggered proteasomal degradation of cFLIPL.
Consistently, the recruitment of cFLIPL to the Ripotosome
was significantly reduced in the cisplatin and Chal-24
co-treated cells, which was associated with increased
caspase 8 recruitment (Fig. 5A). Importantly, ectopic
expression of cFLIPL strongly attenuated cytotoxicity
induced by cisplatin and Chal-24 co-treatment (Fig. 5F).
Altogether, these data suggest that the combination of
cisplatin and Chal-24 induces cell death by promoting
Ripoptosome-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 6).

repair and apoptosis inhibition [30]. Chal-24 may prevent
and attenuate acquired cisplatin resistance by targeting
different pathways from those activated by cisplatin, which
deserve further studies.
We reported recently that Chal-24 activates
autophagy and Ripoptosome formation for cancer cell
necroptosis at relatively high concentrations (>  8  μM)
[17]. However, it was noticed that at a lower concentration
(0.3 μM), Chal-24 induces apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest [17, 18]. At the high Chal-24 concentrations,
the JNK-mediated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL phosphorylation
pathway that disrupts the Beclin1/Bcl-2 and Belin1/
Bcl-xL complexes is required for autophagy, and the
ERK- and autophagy-mediated degradation of IAPs
promotes Ripoptosome formation. Interestingly, we found
in this report that these cancer cell-killing pathways can
be activated by relatively low Chal-24 concentrations
(≤ 1 μM) and further potentiated by cisplatin, although the
cellular outcome is apoptosis instead of necroptosis. The
outcome of apoptotic cell death is not surprising, because
both the autophagy process and the Ripoptosome can
lead to either apoptosis or necroptosis depending on cell
context and the types of stimulation [12–14, 25, 31, 32].
Interestingly, mitosis inhibitors such as taxol induce
Bcl-2 phosphorylation involving MAPKs such as JNK
[33, 34]. However, consistent with literature [35], there is
limited potentiation of cytotoxicity in Taxol and cisplatin
co-treatment (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that
the induction of JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation
is insufficient and additional important pathways are
required for synergistic cytotoxicity induced by Chal-24
and cisplatin combination. It would be interesting to
investigate in the future if Chal-24-induced and JNKmediated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL phosphorylation involves cell
cycle signaling pathways.
The IAP proteins are important for promoting the
NF-κB cell survival pathway and suppressing cell death
during TNFR1 signaling [19, 36, 37]. IAPs are frequently
overexpressed in cancer cells, which contributes to cell
survival, chemoresistance, disease progression and poor
prognosis [23]. Thus, IAPs are proposed to be targets
for cancer chemotherapy [38]. One major IAP-regulated
factor is RIP1, a key mediator of both cell survival and
death pathways and the central protein of the Ripoptosome
complex [23]. Under certain conditions such as DNA
damage induced by DNA topoisomerase II inhibition,
IAPs are degraded to trigger Ripoptosome formation,
and the Ripoptosome serves as a cell death-inducing
platform for either apoptosis or necroptosis [12, 13, 25].
The Ripoptosome-mediated cell death pathways are
kept in check by c-FLIPL [11, 12]. Data from the current
study suggest that cisplatin is able to effectively cause
FLIPL degradation to release the brake on Ripoptosomemediated cell death pathways. Interestingly, c-FLIP is
overexpressed in cancer cells and involved in cancer

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that the combination
of cisplatin and Chal-24 significantly potentiates
apoptotic cytotoxicity in several human lung cancer
cell lines. These results establish a novel mechanism
for combination therapy with these agents that involves
a series of processes: Chal-24 induces autophagy and
Ripoptosome formation that are effectively enhanced by
cisplatin, and cisplatin promotes degradation of c-FLIPL
to release the brake on Ripoptosome-mediated apoptosis.
The autophagy- and Ripotosome-mediated apoptosis
signaling pathways, together with the DNA damagemediated apoptosis pathway activated by cisplatin,
cooperatively contribute to the synergistic anticancer
effect of cisplatin and Chal-24 combination (Fig. 6). This
novel cancer cell killing mechanism could be exploited for
chemotherapy, and the cisplatin and Chal-24 combination
could be a potential effective approach for improving
anticancer therapeutic efficacy and overcoming cancer
chemoresistance.
Theoretically, combinations of drugs that cause a
similar effect but function through distinct mechanisms
could achieve a synergistic effect in outcome [28, 29].
It is well established that cisplatin kills cancer cells
by crosslinking DNA resulting in DNA strand breaks
during mitotic cell division to induce apoptosis [9, 10].
In contrast, Chal-24 kills cancer cells through autophagyand Ripoptosome-mediated cell death [17]. Thus,
we hypothesize the combination of these agents will
synergistically kill cancer cells. Indeed, the results verified
this hypothesis. In addition, acquired cisplatin resistance
is common in patients receiving platinum-based therapy,
which involves increased drug detoxification and DNA

pathogenesis [39]. It is also proposed that c-FLIP could
be a target for cancer therapy [40]. Because the cisplatin
and Chal-24 combination simultaneously suppresses
both IAPs and c-FLIP, it could be an ideal approach to
achieve synergistic anticancer efficacy by targeting these
two antiapoptotic factors that function through different
mechanisms. It is remarkable that p53 is a key factor
for DNA damage response that affects the anticancer

activity of cisplatin. Our results show that the response
to cisplatin and Chal-24 combination in cells with p53
mutation (H23) or deletion (H1299) was comparable to
cell lines having wild-type p53 (A549 and H460) (Figs.

had no detectable effect on cell death induced by this drug
combination (Data not shown). Thus, it is likely that the

A549, H460, H23 and H1299 cells were obtained
from America Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA,
USA) and grown in RPIM 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured in
standard incubator conditions at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity assay was conducted with a
cytotoxicity detection kit (Promega) based on the
release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cells were
seeded in a 48-well plate at 40–50% confluence. After
overnight culture, cells were treated as indicated in each

figure legend. LDH release was measured as described
previously [44]. Combination index (CI) was calculated as
described [45]. To examine the effect of ectopic expression
of cIAP2 or c-FLIP on cytotoxicity induced by the Chal-24
and cisplatin combination, A549 cells were transfected 24
h with EGFP and pcDNA, EGFP and c-IAP2 expression
plasmids or EGFP and FLIP expression plasmids. EGFP
was used as a transfection marker. Then the cells were
treated with cisplatin (10 μM) and Chal-24 (1 μM) for
40 h and examined under a fluorescence microscope. The
percentage of live cells in the treated samples relative to
their respective untreated cells was calculated as described
previously [46].

Western blot and immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were prepared by suspending cells
in M2 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 0.5% NP40,
250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate,
1 mM sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal
amounts of protein from each cell lysates were resolved
by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western
blot. The proteins were visualized with enhanced
chemiluminescence (Millipore) following the instructions
of the manufacture. Each experiment was repeated at
least three times and representative results are shown.
For immunoprecipitation, cells were cultured in 100-mm
dishes, treated as indicated in each figure legend, and
lysed in M2 buffer. Cell lysates were incubated with 1 mg
RIP1 antibody and 20 μl protein A-agarose beads (50%)
overnight. Then the beads were washed six times with M2
buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted off the beads
with electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were
boiled for 5 min and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel.
Proteins of interest were detected by Western blot [47, 48].

A549 and H460 cells were seeded in a 12-well
plate and 48-well plate the day before transfection at
40–50% confluence. siRNA was transfected with siRNA
INTERFERin (polyplus-transfection.) [48]. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cisplatin (10 μM) and Chal-24
(1 μM) were added to the culture for 48 h and LDH
release was measured to examine cisplatin and Chal24 induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown was confirmed by
Western blot.
