Abstract
Acquired chemoresistance has curtailed cancer survival since
the dawn of chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests a
major role for cancer stem cells (CSC) in chemoresistance,
although their involvement in acquired resistance is still
unknown. The use of aspirin has been associated with reduced
cancer risk and recurrence, suggesting that the anti-inﬂammatory
drug may exert effects on CSCs. In this study, we investigated the
contribution of CSCs to acquired chemoresistance of breast cancer
and the avenues for reversing such effects with aspirin. We
observed that the residual risk of recurrence was higher in breast
cancer patients who had acquired chemoresistance. Treatment of
preexisting CSCs with a genotoxic drug combination (5-ﬂuoro-

uracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) generated an NFkB–
IL6–dependent inﬂammatory environment that imparted stemness to nonstem cancer cells, induced multidrug resistance, and
enhanced the migration potential of CSCs. Treatment with aspirin
prior to chemotherapy suppressed the acquisition of chemoresistance by perturbing the nuclear translocation of NFkB in
preexisting CSCs. Therefore, disruptions to the NFkB–IL6 feedback loop prevented CSC induction and sensitized preexisting
CSCs to chemotherapy. Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that
combining aspirin and conventional chemotherapy may offer a
new treatment strategy to improve recurrence-free survival of
breast cancer patients. Cancer Res; 76(7); 2000–12. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

cancer stem cells (CSCs), by virtue of their relative resistance to
chemotherapy may contribute to tumor recurrence (5, 6). Consistent with these reports, several groups reported enrichment for
CSCs when solid cancers were subjected to classical anticancer
treatment (7–11). In accumulation, these studies suggest that
signiﬁcant improvement in patient outcome will require drugs
that selectively target CSCs in combination with conventional
chemotherapeutic regimens that target rapidly proliferating cells.
Epidemiologic and clinical studies indicate that inﬂammation
is correlated with an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer
patients (12), and NFkB plays a causative role in inﬂammation
(13). Recent literature highlights the importance of NFkB-controlled family of proinﬂammatory cytokines, signiﬁcantly IL6, in
CSC maintenance (14) and in regulating plasticity of neoplastic
cells (15), thereby suggesting the possible involvement of NFkB–
IL6 pathway in aggressive disease recurrence following NACT.
Interestingly, multiple meta-analyses showed that patients with
cardiovascular diseases treated with FDA-approved anti-inﬂammatory drug, aspirin, have reduced cancer risk (16, 17). Recent
epidemiologic studies have found that women who took aspirin
after a diagnosis of breast cancer had a better prognosis than
women who did not take aspirin, indicating that aspirin was
associated with a decreased risk of distant recurrence (18),
although the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Considering
all this information, we envisaged the role of aspirin in improving
the response of breast tumors to chemotherapeutic regimen to
ﬁnally improve recurrence-free survival of patients. We therefore
investigated whether aspirin could suppress acquisition of

Although the advent of highly targeted therapeutics based on
small-molecule inhibitors and mAbs has revolutionized the treatment of some cancers, chemotherapy remains the mainstay
treatment for most tumors, especially for locally advanced breast
cancer (LABC; ref. 1). Although a majority of LABC patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) experience a
reduction in tumor size (1), a substantial number either exhibits
signiﬁcant intrinsic resistance or acquire characteristics of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy, i.e., acquired resistance (2,
3), thereby limiting the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic regimens.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this treatment failure and recurrence (4). In particular, it has been suggested that a small subpopulation of cells within tumors, called

resistance during standard chemotherapy by targeting CSC pool,
which would be expected to diminish disease progression and
consequently improve overall and disease-free survival (DFS) of
LABC patients.

Materials and Methods
Preclinical study design
Retrospective cohort observational study. A total of 203 patients,
enrolled for treatment in either Bankura Sammilani Medical
College (BSMC; Bankura, West Bengal, India) or Comprehensive
Breast Service Clinic in IPGMER and SSKM Hospital, (Kolkata,
West Bengal, India) between January 2010 and December 2013,
with histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed breast cancer recurrence were retrospectively reviewed for their medical records
and radiologic images to determine the DFS period and their
response to chemotherapy cycles. Patients having histologically or
cytologically documented LABC characteristics, that is, primary
tumors > 5 cm, with skin or chest wall involvement or with matted
axillary adenopathy at the time of the ﬁrst presentation of disease
and grade III according to American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) criteria (19) and were prescribed neoadjuvant 5-ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 per cycle (FAC) chemotherapeutic regimen,
were eligible for this study, whereas previous solid tumors, age <
18 years, distant recurrences, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
dropouts were considered exclusion criteria of the study.
Prospective cohort experimental study. Fifty patients with histologically or cytologically documented LABC characteristics, who
attended above-mentioned hospitals from January 2009 to
December 2010, were assessed for their pathologic (20) and
clinical (21) responses toward neoadjuvant FAC treatment. On
the basis of their responses during the course of chemotherapy,
patients were categorized into chemotherapy-sensitive (CS),
acquired chemoresistant (CR), and inherent resistance group.
Response of primary cells to treatments was also determined on
the basis of their estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR), and HER2 status. Tumor characteristics, that is, clinical (age,
tumor, and node), histopathologic (grade, ER, PR, and HER2
status, ductal, lobular, and invasive), and molecular [luminal and
basal, by assessing their ER/PR status (22, 23)] characteristics of
each patient were collected from the pathology departments
of above-mentioned hospitals and tabulated for reference in
Supplementary Table S1A. Patients with inherent chemotherapy
resistance, previous solid tumors, <18 years, and breast cancer
recurrences or contralateral tumors were excluded from the study.
All LABC patients were treated with FAC regime with a gap of 21
days between two cycles, followed by surgery. After the completion of treatment, patients were followed up monthly for ﬁrst
three months and then once in four months for a total period of
three years to determine their "clinical outcome." DFS period was
calculated from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence of
disease.
Ex vivo study. Patients having histologically or cytologically documented LABC characteristics, and of grade III according to AJCC
criteria (19), luminal histotype, i.e., ERþ/PRþ and either negative
(luminal A subtype) or positive (luminal B subtype) HER2 status
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), and those not been treated with
chemotherapy or radiotherapy were eligible for this study.

Selected cases consisted of 30 primary breast cancer patients. Basal
histotype breast cancers were excluded from the study as basal
subtypes displayed "inherent" resistance to chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1A; ref. 24). Tumor characteristics (clinical and
histopathologic) were available and collected retrospectively from
the pathology departments of above-mentioned hospitals. Furthermore, the response of primary cells to in vitro treatments was also
determined on the basis of their ER/PR/HER2 status. All this
information has been tabulated in Supplementary Table S1B.
All these studies were planned and approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committees of BSMC, Bankura, India (approval
number: CNMC/ETHI/162/P) and IPGMER and SSKM Hospital
(approval number: Inst/IEC/308), Kolkata, and associated
research and analyses were done in Bose Institute (Kolkata, India)
in accordance with the Institutional Human Ethics Committee
(approval number: BIHEC/2010-11/11). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Primary human tissue culture
For prospective cohort experimental study, ultrasound-guided
core biopsy samples were obtained at baseline before any chemotherapy, and thereafter, upon completion of treatment, surgically resected breast cancer tissue, tumor marginal tissue, and
normal breast tissue samples were obtained. For ex vivo preclinical
study, untreated primary human breast cancer tissue samples were
procured. All samples were mechanically disaggregated with
collagenase (25). Tumor cells were sorted twice after staining
with APC-anti-CD44 and PE-anti-CD24. Nontumor cells were
depleted with FITC-tagged cocktail of lineage marker antibodies,
and the purity was veriﬁed ﬂow cytometrically (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Dilutions of antibodies are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.
Cell lines and cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75-1
were obtained from National Centre for Cell Science (Pune, India)
between 2012 and 2015, and MDA-MB-361 and BT-474, received
in 2015, were kind gifts from Dr. A. Mal, Roswell Park Cancer
Institute (Buffalo, NY). All cell lines were authenticated by short
tandem repeat analysis and each was passaged for fewer than 6
months after resuscitation. Cells were routinely maintained in
DMEM as described previously (26).
Antibodies and treatments
Cells were treated with chemotherapeutic regimen FAC (MP
Biomedicals) in 10:1:10 ratios and with 1 to 5 mmol/L aspirin
(MP Biomedicals) for speciﬁc experiments. Because aspirin is
sparingly soluble in distilled water (27), the 1 mol/L stock
solution was prepared in DMSO. For all in vitro assays with aspirin,
DMSO was used as control. In selected experiments, cells were
incubated with IL6-neutralizing antibody (1.5 mg/mL), recombinant IL6 (rIL6, 1.2 ng/mL), Brefeldin A (1 mg/mL), PMA (500 ng/
mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL; BD Biosciences), SN50 (18 mmol/L)
or MG132 (10 mmol/L; Calbiochem), and mitomycin c (10 mg/
mL, MP Biomedicals).
In vitro tumorigenicity assay and mammosphere culture
Different breast cancer cells (2.5  104 cells/well) were cultured
and propagated in suspension culture as described previously
(28). Mammosphere-forming efﬁciency was determined by

counting the number of mammospheres (average diameter, 100
mm) under a light microscope at 10 magniﬁcation and reported
as the number of mammospheres divided by the number of cells
seeded and expressed as percentage.
Flow cytometry
Human breast CSC markers, chemoresistance, EMT, and dedifferentiation phenomena were analyzed ﬂow cytometrically
(FACSVerse, Becton Dickinson; ref. 29). Percent apoptosis of
CSCs/nonstem cancer cells (NSCC) were determined (26). For
assaying intracellular IL6, IL6-PE was used (30). Dilutions of
antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Positive staining
was considered based on the negativity of an isotype control. A
minimum of 10,000 events were recorded for all samples. Most
phenotypic data were validated using the same antibodies with
alternate labels.
Plasmid transfections
CSCs were transfected separately with 300 pmol of IL6 shRNA
(Addgene). The pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding IkBa-32A/36A
cDNA (IkBa super-repressor, IkBa-SR; kind gift from Dr. J.
Didonato, The Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH) was transfected
in sorted CSCs for overexpression studies, and pd2EGFP-N1
vector (Clontech) was used for labeling sorted NSCCs (29).
Confocal microscopy
Confocal microscopy for the visualization of NFkB was done as
previously described (31).
Transwell migration assay
Cells (2.5  104) were seeded into 24-well cell culture inserts
with 8 mm pores (BD Falcon), and migration of cells was recorded
after 12 hours (29).
ChIP assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a ChIP Assay Kit (Millipore) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. PCR assay for identiﬁcation of
NFkB-binding region on ABCG2 and ABCC1 promoters was
performed using speciﬁc primer sets. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The PCR products were analyzed by 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis (32, 33).
Statistical analysis
Values are shown as SEMs except otherwise indicated. Comparison of multiple experimental groups was performed by twoway ANOVA test. Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot DFS
curves, and log-rank test was used to estimate the statistical
difference between groups. Data were analyzed, and when appropriate, signiﬁcance of the differences between mean values was
determined by a Student t test. Results were considered signiﬁcant
at P  0.05.
Other standard reagents and methods are provided in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.

Results
Residual risk of recurrence was higher in LABC patients with
acquired chemoresistance
Analysis of retrospective cohort observational study revealed
that the number of chemoresistant patients (n ¼ 153) with

2002 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

recurrence of disease was higher than chemosensitive patients
(n ¼ 50; Fig. 1A). Further scrutiny of the analysis revealed a close
association between locoregional recurrences (LCR) of disease
with acquired resistance to therapy (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
These indications were conﬁrmed by prospective cohort experimental study. According to clinical and pathologic response
guidelines (20, 21), 11 cases were categorized in acquired CRgroup (CR-primary tumor), whereas 29 cases were categorized in
CS-group (CS-primary tumor; Supplementary Table S1A). Inherently, CR patients were excluded from this study. Acquisition of
resistance by cells of CR-primary tissue was validated by their
higher expression levels of chemoresistant markers, ABCG2 and
ABCC1, following NACT when compared with cells of CS-primary
tissue (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The analysis of tumor molecular
characteristics showed that all CS- and CR-primary tumors were of
luminal histotype, that is, ERþ/PRþ, whereas inherently CR
patients were of basal histotype, i.e., ER/PR and were excluded
from this study. Luminal primary tumors were of two subtypes: (i)
ERþ/PRþ/HER2 luminal A histotype and (ii) ERþ/PRþ/HER2þ
luminal B histotype. For this study, primary breast cancer tissues/
cells of luminal histotype were included as a broad category,
although the presence or absence of ER/PR and HER2 was predictive of the response of tumor to chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S1A). Follow-up studies further validated the relation
between poor therapeutic response and LCR as conﬁrmed by
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (Fig. 1B). These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that the residual risk of breast cancer recurrence was higher
in patients who acquire resistance with treatment as compared
with CS patients.
Chemotherapy increases CSC pool in LABC patients with
acquired chemoresistance
Next, we investigated the effect of chemotherapy on CSC content
of mammary epithelial tumors. Higher percent CSC content of CRtumors was detected as compared with CS-tumors (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, increase in percent CSCs with chemotherapy was
observed when paired specimens from CR patients, obtained prior
to chemotherapy and at surgery following chemotherapy, were
compared (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2C). Increase in the
expression levels of other CSC-related markers, Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2, and Aldh1 in chemotherapy-treated CR-primary tumor samples
when compared with matched untreated samples, supported
above-mentioned ﬁndings (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S2D).
In vitro validation of chemotherapy-mediated increase in CSC
content
For in vitro validation of above ﬁndings, breast cancer cell lines,
MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-361, and BT-474, mimicking
the characteristics of the primary cell lines, i.e., luminal histotype,
were included in the study. Among these, MCF-7, T47D, and ZR75-1 were ERþ/PRþ/HER2, whereas MDA-MB-361 and BT-474
were ERþ/PRþ/HER2þ. Percent CSCs, expression levels of CSCrelated markers, and mammosphere-forming efﬁciency (Fig. 1F,
Supplementary Fig. S2E) increased when these cells were treated
with chemotherapeutic regimen FAC as administrated to the
patients included in the study (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Furthermore, FAC treatment selectively killed NSCCs as opposed to CSCs
(Fig 1G, top). These ﬁndings supported our postulation that
posttreatment increase in CSC repertoire can be "apparent" due
to relative decrease in NSCCs. Revalidating analysis, showing
increase in CSC number upon FAC treatment, ruled out the

mammary tissue (Fig. 2C, right) of FAC-treated CR-patients as
compared with CS-patients. Such increase in CSCs might be due
to relative increase in CSC number in CR-primary tissue. However, the fold change (normal to tumor) in CSC numbers, being
signiﬁcantly higher in CR-set than in CS-set (Fig. 2D), nulliﬁed
this apprehension. CSCs isolated from normal tissue of CRprimary patients demonstrated enhanced expression of chemoresistance markers and migration potential (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S3F) when compared with that of CS-patients. These
ﬁndings are in accordance with the recent reports that following
chemotherapy, the proportion of disseminated CSCs with mesenchymal phenotype increases in the blood of patients (34, 35).
These ﬁndings indicate the possibility that aggressive CSCs
hiding in distant anatomic sites even after resection of primary
tumor might play a role in disease recurrence at the local site in
CR-patients (Fig. 1B).
Therapy induces expression of CSC phenotypic markers in
NSCCs
FAC-induced increase in CSCs might be due to (i) proliferation of
preexisting CSC pool or/and (ii) conversion of NSCCs into a stemlike state. However, proliferation blocker mitomycin C failing to
signiﬁcantly inhibit FAC-induced increase in CSCs and the expression of CSC-speciﬁc markers (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4A)
highlighted the second possibility. Interestingly, irrespective of the
presence or absence of mitomycin C, FAC treatment failed to
signiﬁcantly increase the number of puriﬁed CSCs (Fig. 3B). These
ﬁndings conﬁrmed that induction of stemness in NSCCs was a
major cause underlying FAC-induced CSC expansion, although the
input of CSC proliferation was not completely negated.
Therapy-mediated induction of CSC phenotype in NSCCs is
driven by preexisting CSCs
In paradox with our previous ﬁndings, no signiﬁcant induction
of CSC markers (Fig. 3C), chemoresistance, and migration related
markers (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4B) was observed in
FAC-treated NSCCs from pretreatment CR-primary tumors and
MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4E). Treatment-mediated
induction of stem-like signature in NSCCs might thus be inﬂuenced by preexisting CSCs. To validate our hypothesis, (i) puriﬁed
NSCCs were GFP-tagged and thereafter cocultured with untagged
CSCs (1:1) and (ii) CSCs and NSCCs (1:1) puriﬁed from MCF-7
cells were cocultured in contact-independent manner. Appearance of GFP-CSCs in the mixed population postchemotherapy
(Fig. 3E) conﬁrmed the contribution of preexisting CSCs in
NSCC-to-CSC conversion. Also, several fold increase in FACmediated CSC induction was observed in contact-independent
NSCCs as compared with that in FAC-treated NSCCs (Fig. 3F).
Increase in the expression levels of other CSC-speciﬁc markers
(Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S5A) only in NSCCs cocultured
with CSCs further validated preexisting CSC-mediated induction
of CSC phenotype in NSCCs.
Therapy triggers NFkB-dependent IL6 inﬂammatory feedback
loop in preexisting CSCs
Aforementioned results raised the possibility of the involvement of CSC-derived soluble factors in NSCC to CSC conversion.
Recent reports have demonstrated NFkB-dependent IL6 activation (13, 14) and the role of IL6 in inducible transition of NSCCs
to CSCs (15). Our results showed FAC-induced signiﬁcant
increase in nuclear NFkB in CR-primary tumors (Fig. 4A) and in

www.aacrjournals.org

different breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B). However,
FAC-treated CS-primary tumors failed to demonstrate such
increase (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, CSCs of MCF-7 cells displayed
increased levels of nuclear NFkB (Fig. 4Band Supplementary Fig.
S5C) and its downstream inﬂammatory and antiapoptotic regulators, Cox-2, Bcl-2, and XIAP (Fig. 4C), when compared with
their corresponding NSCCs, and FAC treatment further increased
the expressions. Posttreatment CR-primary tumors, but not CSprimary tumors, also demonstrated increase in IL6 mRNA when
compared with pretreatment ones (Fig. 4D). Time-dependent
stimulation of intracellular IL6 was also observed in MCF-7 cells
upon FAC treatment (Fig. 4E, left) and also in different breast
cancer cells upon 3 hours of FAC treatment (Fig. 4E, right). IL6
secretion was higher from CSCs than NSCCs of MCF-7 cells and
increased further with FAC treatment (Fig. 4F). That FAC-mediated increase in CSC-shed IL6 was NFkB-dependent was conﬁrmed when blocking NFkB nuclear activity in CSCs signiﬁcantly
decreased IL6 secretion (Fig. 4G, left). Interestingly, although IL6
inhibitions failed to retain NFkB in nucleus in preexisting CSCs
even upon FAC treatment, exposing CSCs to rIL6(1.2 ng/mL)
enhanced the same (Fig. 4G, middle and right), conﬁrming that
FAC treatment activated an NFkB–IL6–positive inﬂammatory
feedback loop in preexisting CSCs.
Preexisting CSCs promote NSCC-to-CSC conversion in a
paracrine manner
Next, NSCCs of MCF-7 cells were (i) cocultured with conditioned media (CM) of untreated/FAC-treated puriﬁed CSCs, or
(ii) treated with rIL6 (Fig. 5A, left). After 72 hours, CM of FACtreated CSCs or rIL6 was found to induce CD44þ/CD24/low
phenotype in NSCCs of MCF-7 cells, while reversing such conditions resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition, although not complete,
in inducing CSC signature in NSCCs (Fig. 5A, middle). Increase in
IL6 in the CM of CSCs also increased ABCG2 level in newly
generated CSCs (Fig. 5A, right).
Therefore, FAC-triggered robust positive inﬂammatory feedback loop in preexisting CSCs signiﬁcantly contributed in the
transition of NSCCs-to-CSCs as well as in their attainment of
aggressive phenotype, although the involvement of other soluble
factors could not be ruled out.
Aspirin inhibits chemotherapy-mediated de novo generation of
aggressive CSC pool
Next, preexisting CSCs, puriﬁed from MCF-7 cells, were treated
with plasma achievable dose range (1-5 mmol/L; ref. 36) of
aspirin. Results of Fig. 5B and C and Supplementary Fig. S6A
depicted that 2.5 mmol/L dose of aspirin efﬁciently downregulated nuclear NFkB as well as Bcl-2, and Cox2, in CSCs by
decreasing IkBa phosphorylation level and disrupting NFkB–IL6
inﬂammatory signaling (Fig. 5D). Incubation of NSCCs with CM
of CSCs treated with aspirin prior to FAC treatment decreased the
induction of CSC phenotype (Fig. 5E, left) and inhibited the
upregulation of chemoresistance markers in newly generated
CSCs (Fig. 5F). In contrast, CM of aspirin-treated (i) NFkB-overexpressed or (ii) rIL6-exposed CSCs failed to resist in inducing
CSC phenotype in NSCCs (Fig. 5E, left). Aspirin pretreatment was
also effective when NSCCs were cocultured with CSCs, as evident

comparatively better response to treatment (Supplementary Table
S1B). Thereafter, CSCs puriﬁed from CS- and CR-primary human
cell lines and from different breast cancer cell lines, with almost
similar characteristics as that of primary cell lines, were exposed to
aspirin treatment prior to FAC. Supporting our hypothesis, results
of aspirin-preexposed CSCs showed signiﬁcant increase in
Annexin V positivity upon FAC treatment while aspirin alone
failed to do so (Fig. 6A and 6B, top and Supplementary Fig. S6C),
indicating that aspirin sensitized CSCs towards chemotherapy
regimen. Such combinatorial therapy also decreased CSC content
even below the level present in their untreated counterparts (Fig.
6A and 6B, bottom and Supplementary Fig. S6D). Further analysis
with MCF-7 cells revealed that such sensitization of preexisting
CSCs resulted from signiﬁcant decrease in the expression levels of
chemoresistance markers (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, aspirin-induced

decrease in chemoresistance of preexisting CSCs was inhibited by
rIL6 or upon NFkB overexpression (Fig. 6D). ChIP assay further
showed that although FAC treatment increased NFkB recruitment
on the promoter regions of ABCG2 and ABCC1 in CSCs (Fig. 6E),
such bindings were decreased in aspirin-pretreated sets. These
results signiﬁed that aspirin pretreatment decreased the expression of drug efﬂux pumps, thereby sensitizing preexisting CSCs to
genotoxic therapy.
All these results unveiled the hitherto unexplored role of aspirin
in hindering the acquisition of aggressive phenotype by luminal
histotype breast cancer cells during the course of therapy by (i)
perturbing preexisting CSC-assisted de novo conversion of NSCCs to
aggressive CSCs and (ii) sensitizing inherently chemoresistant
preexisting CSCs. These ﬁndings not only identiﬁed preexisting
CSCs as the probable candidates escalating therapy-induced

recurrence in breast cancer patients but also raised the possibility of
combining aspirin with genotoxic therapies to efﬁciently improve
relapse-free survival in NACT-treated breast cancer patients.

Discussion
Resistance of breast tumors toward therapy is one of the major
causes of the incurability of the disease. In addition to being
inherently resistant to therapies during the course of chemotherapeutic treatments, tumors also acquire resistance towards such
therapies. The consequences are 2-fold; ﬁrst, the tumors acquire
resistance with progressive treatment and second, provide impetus to the growth of recurrent tumors (1–4). CSC subpopulation
of the tumor has been held responsible for both therapy resistance
and development of tumor recurrences (5–7, 26, 38). Therefore,
the resistance of CSCs to chemotherapy/radiotherapy might be a
plausible mechanism to explain breast cancer recurrence.
In keeping with these reports, we observed that acquired
chemotherapy–resistant patients are at a greater risk of developing
tumor recurrence than chemotherapy-sensitive patients. An explanation for this observation is partly provided by existing reports
that NACT leads to enrichment of CSCs (7–11, 39). However, this
explanation alone is not enough to reason the recurrence of
tumors as the CSC subpopulation, being a part of the primary
tumor itself, must get removed during surgical resection of the
tumor mass. In this preclinical study, we identiﬁed that in patient
samples and cell lines of luminal histotype, NACT treatment
results in augmentation of aggressive CSC pool, which besides
impeding therapeutic outcome, also helps them to hide in distant
sites to escape surgery, thus providing an unintended advantage of
recurrence.
Next, we sought to explore the mechanisms responsible for the
enrichment of CSCs following NACT. Several studies have demonstrated that therapeutic intervention may contribute to CSC
genesis. In addition to earlier reports that suggest that the CSC
enrichment after NACT results from selection as the NSCCs naturally succumb to these anticancer therapies, we found conversion
of nonstem breast cancer population to CSCs, which also concurrently acquire resistance and aggressive properties. These ﬁndings
are further supported by earlier reports describing the spontaneous
conversion of nonstem tumor cells to CSCs (15, 40, 41).
An in-depth analysis to divulge the mechanisms responsible for
NACT-induced conversion of NSCCs-to-CSCs revealed that this
effect was brought about through paracrine secretion of IL6, NFkB
downstream effector (13–15). Iliopoulos and colleagues (15)
have shown that the spent media from CSCs promote non–
CSC-to-CSC conversion in IL6-dependent manner. Interestingly,
in many types of cancer, elevated level of serum IL6 was found
(42), and the same was strongly correlated with poor overall
survival and accelerated disease progression (43).
Interestingly, NFkB–IL6 signaling has been implicated in the
self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumorigenesis (14, 44–47).
The involvement of NFkB–IL6 signaling in our ex vivo and in vitro
models prompted us to evaluate the role of aspirin in abrogating
this pathway to chemosensitize resistant breast tumors. In our
study, physiologic doses of aspirin (36) efﬁciently perturbed
nuclear translocation of NFkB, resulting in the abrogation of
NFkB–IL6 feedback loop culminating in the inhibition of paracrine induction of NSCC-to-CSC conversion and also perturbing
the gain of chemoresistance and migration potential. Moreover,
aspirin potentially chemosensitized preexisting CSC pool by

2010 Cancer Res; 76(7) April 1, 2016

perturbing NFkB-mediated expression of chemoresistance promoting factors. Our study, therefore, signiﬁes the possibility of a
combination strategy that induces apoptosis in preexisting CSCs
and NSCCs after FAC administration. This approach was further
justiﬁed by a recent study by Maity and colleagues (37), where
aspirin treatment prevented tumor growth in nude mice xenograft
model by reducing the self-renewal capacity and growth of breast
CSCs but failed to induce apoptosis by itself even in inherently
resistant CSCs at physiologically achievable dose (37). Taken
together, our study thus provides a scientiﬁc rationale for combining aspirin with standard chemotherapy for successful targeting of both CSC and NSCC pool to restrain the acquisition of
aggressive phenotype by breast cancer cells during the course of
chemotherapy. These data corroborated previous clinical studies
with breast cancer patients, in which a link between aspirin use
and lower incidences of cancer initiation, recurrence, and metastasis, the three attributes associated with CSCs, has been found
(16, 17, 48, 49).
In conclusion, tumor relapse is a common and devastating
phenomenon in clinical oncology following initial success with
cytotoxic therapies. We provide evidence that aspirin-mediated
inhibition of NFkB–IL6 inﬂammatory signaling in preexisting
CSC meets the criteria for the development of potential treatment
strategies by sensitizing preexisting CSCs in one hand and inhibiting NSCC-to-CSC conversion on the other. Moreover, controlling chemoresistance of CSCs and the generation of new CSCs
during chemotherapy treatment may ultimately improve curability and allow deescalation of currently given chemotherapeutic
dose, thereby reducing acute and long-term adverse effects. Therefore, cotreatment of aspirin and chemotherapeutic regimen can be
a potentially safe and attractive treatment strategy to tackle cancer
in a multipronged approach, targeting both CSC and NSCC
populations.
