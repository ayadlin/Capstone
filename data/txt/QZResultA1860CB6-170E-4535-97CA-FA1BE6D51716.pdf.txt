Resistance of Human Breast Cancer Cells

Abstract
Despite the fact that most breast cancer patients have estrogen receptor (ER) a-positive tumors, up to 50% of
the patients are or soon develop resistance to endocrine therapy. It is recognized that HER2 activation is one of
the major mechanisms contributing to endocrine resistance. In this study, we report that the ER coactivator MED1
is a novel cross-talk point for the HER2 and ERa pathways. Tissue microarray analysis of human breast cancers
revealed that MED1 expression positively correlates most strongly with HER2 status of the tumors. MED1 was
highly phosphorylated, in a HER2-dependent manner, at the site known to be critical for its activation.
Importantly, RNAi-mediated attenuation of MED1 sensitized HER2-overexpressing cells to tamoxifen treatment.
MED1 and its phosphorylated form, but not the corepressors N-CoR and SMRT, were recruited to the ERa target
gene promoter by tamoxifen in HER2-overexpressing cells. Signiﬁcantly, MED1 attenuation or mutation of MED1
phosphorylation sites was sufﬁcient to restore the promoter recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT. Notably, we found
that MED1 is required for the expression of not only traditional E2-ERa target genes but also the newly described
EGF-ERa target genes. Our results additionally indicated that MED1 is recruited to the HER2 gene and required for
its expression. Taken together, these ﬁndings support a key role for MED1 in HER2-mediated tamoxifen resistance
and suggest its potential usage as a therapeutic target to simultaneously block both ERa and HER2 pathways for
the treatment of this type of endocrine resistant breast cancer. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5625–34. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Estrogen receptor (ER) a is the key mediator of estrogen
functions in the breast and plays prominent roles in breast
cancer (1–5). In fact, about 70% of all breast cancer patients
have ER-positive tumors, whereas selective estrogen receptor
modulators such as tamoxifen have been widely used in the
treatment of these patients. Unfortunately, up to half of all ERpositive tumors either do not respond to this endocrine
therapy or, after initial successful treatment, the tumors recur
as endocrine-resistant breast cancer (6–10). It has been recognized that activation of the tyrosine kinase ErbB-2/HER2 is
one of the major mechanisms contributing to the endocrine
resistance (10–12). However, although blockage of HER2 with
the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been
successfully used as a second-line treatment, again, resistance
to this therapy is quite high. Hence, further development of

novel strategies to selectively block the activities of these
pathways remains a major challenge for the treatment of
human breast cancer.
HER2 is ampliﬁed and overexpressed in 20% to 30% of
invasive breast cancers and has been implicated as a major
player in both de novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance
(7, 12–18). Several clinical studies have also indicated that
HER2 overexpression is associated with a poor outcome in
tamoxifen-treated patients. It was found that ectopic overexpression of HER2 in MCF-7 cells is sufﬁcient to confer these
cells with tamoxifen resistance (19). Further studies showed
that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activated by
HER2 signaling can phosphorylate both ERa and its cofactors
to enhance their activities (11, 16, 20–22). Signiﬁcantly, this
cross-talk between HER2 and ERa pathways has now been
recognized as one of the key mechanisms that confers endocrine therapy resistance to human breast cancers.
Recent studies have established mediator subunit 1 (MED1)
as a key ERa coactivator both in vitro and in vivo (23–30). It has
been shown that ectopic MED1 expression is able to markedly
enhance ERa functions, whereas knockdown of MED1 impairs
both ERa-regulated transcription and estrogen-dependent
growth of breast cancer cells. MED1 directly interacts with
ERa through its 2 classical LxxLL motifs on its central region,
whereas its C-terminus is likely to play important regulatory
roles, as recent studies have shown that MED1 can be phosphorylated and activated by the MAP kinase pathway on
threonines at the C-terminal 1,032 and 1,457 sites (31–34).
Interestingly, further biochemical analyses indicated that

MED1 exists only in a subpopulation of the Mediator complex
with distinct subunit compositions (29). Importantly, most
recent animal studies further revealed that MED1 is expressed
only in selected cell types and plays rather cell-, tissue-, and
gene-speciﬁc roles in mediating estrogen functions in vivo (30).
Signiﬁcantly, MED1 has been reported to be overexpressed in a
high percentage (40%–60%) of human breast cancer cell lines
and primary breast cancers (25, 35–37).
Consistent with previous reports that the MED1 gene is
located within the HER2 amplicon on the chromosome
17q12 region and often coampliﬁes with HER2 (25, 35), here
we provided further evidence showing that MED1 protein
expression levels correlate most strongly with the HER2
status of human breast cancer by tissue microarray (TMA)
analyses. Signiﬁcantly, our studies showed that MED1 is
phosphorylated at the above-mentioned key MAP kinase
sites by HER2 activation. Subsequent mechanistic studies
supported a key role for MED1 and its cross-talk with HER2
in tamoxifen-induced coactivator/corepressor switch on the
ERa target gene promoter. Moreover, we went on to further
explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of MED1 in
HER2-mediated tamoxifen resistance and found that MED1
is not only required for the expression of both E2-ERa and
EGF-ERa target genes, but also for the optimal expression of
HER2 itself.

DM MED1 with packaging constructs according to the manufacturer's instructions (System Biosciences).
Transient transfection and reporter gene assays
MCF-7 and MCF-7/HER2 cells were ﬁrst plated in 24-well
plates containing phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS. Control vector only
(pcDNA3.1) or pcDNA3.1-MED1 was cotransfected with
plasmids expressing ERE-TK-Luc reporter gene by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). pRL-CMV plasmids were
also cotransfected to serve as a transfection efﬁciency
control. Following the transfection, the cells were treated
with TAM for 24 hours before harvest. A dual luciferase
reporter assay system (Promega) was used to measure the
luciferase activity.

Materials and Methods

Real-time reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen) and
reverse transcribed using a SuperScript III ﬁrst strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was then conducted
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagents (Roche) on an ABI
Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems)
using the following primers: cyclin D1: 50 -CGCCCCACCCCTCCAG-30 and 50 -CCGCCCAGACCCTCAGACT-30 ; glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): 50 -CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTA-30 and 50 -AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-30 . The primers used to detect TFF1, Myc, ACP6, and LIF
genes were as described (39, 40).

Cell culture
The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT474 were purchased from American type culture collection and MCF-7/
HER2 cells were described previously (38). Cell lines were
authenticated on the basis of viability, recovery, growth, and
morphology. The expression status of ERa, HER2, and MED1
was further conﬁrmed by Western blot before they were used
in the experiments. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM) medium containing 10% FBS
(Hyclone) at 37 C with 5% CO2 in tissue culture incubators. The
MAP Kinase inhibitor PD95089 and HER2 inhibitor AG825
were purchased from Calbiochem and EMD chemicals, respectively. 17b-estradiol (E2) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM) were
purchased from Sigma. For experiments involving E2 or TAM
treatments, cells were routinely cultured in phenol red-free
DMEM plus 10% charcoal-stripped FBS for at least 3 days
before the treatments.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was conducted as described previously (29, 41). In brief, MCF-7 and
MCF-7/HER2 cells were treated for 45 minutes with vehicle
(ethanol), 100 nmol/L E2 or 1 umol/L TAM and immediately
ﬁxed by adding formaldehyde to the medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 1%. After PBS washing, cells were harvested and
the nuclear lysates were sonicated to generate an average DNA
size of 0.5 to 1 kb. Immunoprecipitation experiments were then
conducted with antibodies against MED1 (29), p-MED1 (34), NCoR, and SMRT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Real-time PCR
ampliﬁcations were conducted after reverse cross-linking and
extraction of DNA from immunoprecipitated chromatin. The
primers for TFF1 promoter, ERa-binding site on HER2 gene,
ACP6 promoter, and LIF enhancer2 all have been previously
described (40, 42).

Plasmids and lentiviral vector preparation
The plasmid pERE-TK-Luc (ERE, estrogen response element), pRL-CMV, pcDNA3.1-MED1, pLKO.1-MED1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and pLKO.1-scramble shRNA were described
previously (29). To generate lentiviral constructs expressing
double-phosphomutant MED1 (T1032A and T1457A, termed
DM MED1), PCR-mediated mutagenesis was conducted using
pcDNA3.1-MED1 as a template. The PCR products were then
cloned into lentiviral vector pCDH-CMV (System Biosciences)
and the sequence conﬁrmed by sequencing (Genewiz). High
titer lentiviruses were generated by transient transfection of
293T cells vector only, pCDH-CMV-WT MED1 or pCDH-CMV-

MTT assay
MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, Sigma) assays were conducted as described previously with minor modiﬁcations (39). Two thousand cells per
well were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with vehicle or
tamoxifen at indicated concentrations in regular DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 7 days. MTT was added to the
medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and incubated
for 30 minutes at room temperature. The medium was then
removed and 0.2 mL DMSO was added. The absorbance of the
converted dye was measured at 570 nm using a Synergy
spectrophotometer (Biotek).

HER2/MED1 Cross-talk and Tamoxifen Resistance

Immunohistochemistry staining
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of human breast
cancer TMA was carried out essentially as previously described
(30). In brief, the slide was ﬁrst deparafﬁnized and subjected to
heat-induced antigen retrieval using citrate buffer. The tissue
sections were then incubated with primary antibodies against
MED1 overnight at 4 C, followed by extensive washes. The slide
was subsequently treated with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and then developed using avidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase with diaminiobenzidine as the substrate (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit, Vectorlab). Hematoxylin
was used for counterstaining and the images were visualized
and captured using axioplan imaging 2e microscope (Zeiss).
Statistical analysis of the data
All experiments were repeated at least 3 to 5 times and data
expressed as average  SD. Statistical analyses of the data were
conducted by pairwise Student's t test. Differences are considered statistically signiﬁcant ( ) if P  0.05 and very significant ( ) if P  0.01. For TMA analyses, the staining intensity of
MED1 in tumor cells was scored by a pathologist using a scale
of 0 to 3 and analyzed by age-adjusted spearman correlation.
The information on age, TNM, tumor grade, and HER2 status
were provided by the manufacturer (BR962, 48 cases/96 cores,
US Biomax).

Results
MED1 expression levels strongly correlate with HER2
status in human breast cancer
We have previously shown that MED1 is required for ERamediated transcription and breast cancer cell growth (29).
MED1 has also been reported to be overexpressed in a high

percentage of human breast cancer cell lines (25, 35–37). To
further explore the role of MED1 in breast cancer, we decided
to assess the MED1 protein expression in human breast cancer
by using TMA analysis. To achieve that, we carried out immunohistochemical staining of the human breast cancer TMA
BR962 (US Biomax) using anti-MED1 antibodies (Fig. 1). The
staining intensity of both nuclear and cytosolic MED1 in these
tumor sections was scored using a scale of 0 to 3. By using ageadjusted spearman correlation, we found that nuclear, but not
cytoplasmic, MED1 expression was highly correlated with
HER2 status, but not with tumor grade or stage (TNM) of the
human breast cancer tissue samples (Table 1).
HER2 overexpression enhances MED1 phosphorylation
via activation of MAP kinase pathway
Previous studies have shown that MED1 can be phosphorylated and activated by the MAP kinase pathway (31–33). It is
also known that the MAP kinase pathway is a key downstream
pathway activated by HER2 ampliﬁcation (15). Therefore, we
decided to carry out experiments to determine whether HER2
activation could lead to MED1 phosphorylation. For this, we
used an antibody generated speciﬁcally against phosphopeptides containing the phosphorylation site of MED1 (Threonine
1023; ref. 34). We ﬁrst compared phosphor-MED1 levels using
MCF-7 cells and BT474 cells that have HER2 ampliﬁcation, and
found that phosphorylated MED1 were present at signiﬁcantly
higher levels in BT474 cells (Fig. 2A). As BT474 cells may
contain additional alterations that can also affect MED1
phosphorylation, we further used MCF-7/HER2 cells to determine whether HER2 overexpression alone is sufﬁcient to
enhance MED1 phosphorylation. Consistent with the results
above, we found that ectopic overexpression of HER2 in MCF-7
cells was sufﬁcient to induce MED1 phosphorylation at this
MAPK site (Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous reports that
MED1 phosphorylation could also increase its stability, we also
found a slight increase of total MED1 protein levels in MCF-7/
HER2 cells, whereas the mRNA levels of MED1 was not affected
(Fig. 2C). Importantly, AG825, a speciﬁc inhibitor for HER2,
signiﬁcantly inhibited MED1 phosphorylation in both BT474
and MCF-7/HER2 cells (Fig. 2D and E). Moreover, we found
that treatment of MCF-7/HER2 cells with MAP kinase inhibitor
PD98059 signiﬁcantly decreased MED1 phosphorylation levels
(Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data support a key role for

HER2 overexpression in mediating MED1 phosphorylation
through the MAP kinase pathway.
Knockdown of MED1 sensitizes HER2 overexpression
cells to tamoxifen treatment
HER2 overexpression has been recognized as a key mechanism in conferring endocrine resistance in human breast
cancer. Our data above, indicating both coexpression and
cross-talk between HER2 and MED1, led us to further test
whether MED1 plays a role in the tamoxifen resistance of
HER2-overexpressing cells. To achieve that, we infected the
BT474 and MCF-7/HER2 cells with lentivirus expressing control scramble or MED1 shRNA and measured cell proliferation
by MTT assay after control vehicle or tamoxifen treatments. As
shown by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3A and B), MED1 shRNA
treatment successfully knocked down MED1 protein expression in both cells. Importantly, we found that MED1 knockdown signiﬁcantly sensitized these HER2-overexpressing cells
to tamoxifen treatment, as compared with control scramble
shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3C and D Supplementary Fig S1A). As
a control, we also conducted the same experiments using
above-mentioned MCF-7 cells that do not express high levels
of HER2. We found that these cells are already highly sensitive
to tamoxifen treatment, as previously reported, and that MED1
knockdown does not signiﬁcantly alter their sensitivity to
tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). These data
support a key role for MED1 in mediating the tamoxifen
resistance of HER2-overexpressing cells.
Previous studies have shown that tamoxifen plays an agonist
role on ERa-mediated transcription in HER2-overexpressing
cells (14, 16). Thus, we carried out to determine the effect of
MED1 on ERa transcriptional activity and estrogen-responsive
gene expression in response to tamoxifen. In agreement with
previous studies, we found that tamoxifen could induce ERa
transcriptional activity in MCF-7/HER2 cells but not in MCF-7

5628

cells (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, we found that transient expression
of MED1 could further enhance ERE-reporter expression by
tamoxifen treatment in MCF-7/HER2 cells. Importantly,
AG825 could totally abolish this tamoxifen induced EREreporter gene activation by MED1, indicating an HER2 dependency. In addition, we have also examined the requirement of
MED1 for tamoxifen-induced expression of several well-known
endogenous ERa target genes (TFF1, cyclinD1, and c-Myc) in
these cells. As shown in Fig. 3F, our results indicate that MED1
is indeed required for the expression of tamoxifen-induced
expression of these endogenous ERa target genes. Moreover,
we also examined the potential effect of MED1 on the transcription of the ERa gene and found that MED1 knockdown
does not affect the ERa mRNA level in MCF-7/HER2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
MED1 inhibits the recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT to
TFF1 promoter by tamoxifen in HER2-overexpressing
cells
Transcriptional corepressors N-CoR and SMRT have been
shown to play important roles in the antiproliferative action of
tamoxifen in breast cancer cells through repression of ERa
target genes in HER2-overexpressing cells (43–45). To gain a
better understanding of the mechanism of how activation of
MED1 phosphorylation by HER2 may lead to endocrine resistance, we conducted ChIP assays to examine the role of MED1
on the recruitments of N-CoR and SMRT on the promoter of
above TFF1 gene, the most widely used and best-characterized
estrogen-responsive gene. As expected, we found tamoxifeninduced promoter occupancy of N-CoR and SMRT but not
MED1 or p-MED1 on the TFF1 promoter in MCF-7 cells (Fig.
4A). However, we observed instead an increased occupancy of
MED1 and p-MED1, but not N-CoR or SMRT on TFF1 gene
promoter in MCF-7/HER2 cell in the presence of tamoxifen.
Importantly, treatment with HER2 inhibitor AG825 effectively

restored the recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT to TFF1 gene
promoter by tamoxifen. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of MED1 by shRNA in these cells can also block this
tamoxifen-induced occupancy of MED1 and p-MED1, and also
restore tamoxifen-induced recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, we have carried out re-ChIP assay and
conﬁrmed that MED1 and ERa are acting on the same TFF1
promoter in MCF-7/HER2 cells by tamoxifen (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Finally, re-ChIP assays again supported that gain of
the interactions between N-CoR/SMRT and ERa occurred on
the same TFF1 promoter in a MED1-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that MED1 phosphorylation by HER2 plays key
roles in preventing tamoxifen-induced recruitment of N-CoR
and SMRT to the promoter of ERa target genes in HER2overexpressing cells. In addition, we found that knockdown of

MED1 also increases tamoxifen-induced recruitment of ERa
corepressor HDAC1 but has no effect on the recruitment of
either ERa itself or ERa coactivator CBP (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
Wild type but not phosphor mutant MED1 prevents
tamoxifen-induced N-CoR and SMRT recruitment
To further determine whether MED1 phosphorylation is
required for the inhibition of the recruitment of these corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT) to the TFF1 gene promoter in
HER2-overexprssing cells, we further generated a double phosphomutant MED1 (DM MED1) with both threonines (T1032
and T1457) known to be activated by the MAP kinase pathway
mutated to alanine (Fig. 5A). Lentivirus expressing WT and DM
MED1 was then used to infect MCF-7/HER2 cells pretreated
with MED1 shRNA for the rescue experiments. We found that

although both WT and DM MED1 express at a very similar level
as shown by Western blot analyses (Fig. 5B), only WT MED1 but
not DM MED1 can effectively restore the tamoxifen-induced
recruitment of MED1 and p-MED1 to TFF1 gene promoter (Fig.
5C). We also found that expression of WT MED1 completely
abolishes tamoxifen-induced recruitments of N-CoR and
SMRT to TFF1 gene promoter. However, in contrast, expression of DM MED1 failed to prevent the promoter recruitments
of either N-CoR or SMRT by tamoxifen. Taken together, these
ﬁndings support the importance of MED1 phosphorylation
sites on tamoxifen-induced recruitment of transcriptional
corepressors N-CoR and SMRT in HER2-overexpressing cells.
MED1 regulates EGF-induced ERa target genes in MCF7/HER2 cells
Most recently, a genome-wide ERa-cistrome analysis
revealed that growth factors such as EGF can stimulate the
binding of ERa to a distinct group of genes (e.g., ACP6 and
LIF; Fig. 6A; ref. 40). These genes were named EGF-ERa target
genes as they are different from previously described E2-

induced ERa target genes (e.g., TFF1 and CyclinD). Importantly, these EGF-ERa target genes are also overexpressed in HER2positive breast cancers. To determine whether MED1 can also
regulate the expression this type of genes in HER2-overexpressing cells, we ﬁrst examine the chromatin occupancy of MED1
on ACP6 and LIF promoters. As shown in Fig. 6B, we found
that MED1 is present on the promoter of ACP6 and LIF genes.
Importantly, the presence of MED1 on these promoters is
signiﬁcantly enhanced in HER2 overexpressing MCF-7/HER2
cells when compared with that of MCF-7 cells. Signiﬁcantly,
treatment with AG825 again totally abolished this increased
recruitment of MED1 to the promoters of ACP6 and LIF genes
in MCF-7/HER2 cells. Next, we conducted real-time RT-PCR
assays to determine whether MED1 is required for the expression of ACP6 and LIF genes by knocking down MED1 in MCF-7/
HER2 cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, we found MED1 shRNA but not
control scramble shRNA treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited
the mRNA levels of both ACP6 and LIF in MCF-7/HER2 cells.
These, together with our above data (Fig. 3F), indicate that
MED1 plays a key role in controlling the expression of both

MED1 is required for the optimal expression of HER2
gene
Interestingly, it has been previously reported that ERa is able
to directly regulate the HER2 gene expression through its
binding site within the HER2 gene (ref. 42; also see diagram
in Fig. 7A). As we have shown that MED1 functions as an ERa
coactivator in both E2-ERa and EGF-ERa target genes, it raises
an important question as to whether MED1 can also regulate
the expression of HER2. To determine the role of MED1 in the
regulation of HER2 expression, we ﬁrst conducted ChIP experiments to determine whether MED1 can bind to this ERabinding region on the HER2 gene. As shown in Fig. 7B, using IgG
as a control, we found MED1 does bind to this ERa-binding
region in both MCF-7 and BT474 cells. Furthermore, our data
indicated that MED1 is present in a signiﬁcantly higher level at
this site in BT474 cells when compared with that of MCF-7
cells. Moreover, we found tamoxifen treatment can further
increase the occupancy of MED1 at this ERa-binding site in

BT474 cells through ChIP and re-ChIP assays (Fig. 7C, Supplementary Fig. S5). Finally, to determine whether MED1 is
required for HER2 gene expression, we conducted further
MED1 shRNA knockdown experiments using BT474 cells. The
data show that MED1 shRNA, but not control scramble shRNA,
effectively inhibits the mRNA and protein expression levels of
HER2 (Fig. 7D and E). Collectively, these data support a direct
role for MED1 in regulating HER2 gene expression.

Discussion
Through this study, we have established the cross-talk
between HER2 and MED1 and showed its roles in mediating
tamoxifen resistance of human breast cancer cells. We found
that: (i) MED1 protein expression highly correlates with HER2
status in human breast cancer; (ii) HER2 overexpression
induces MED1 phosphorylation and knockdown of MED1
sensitize HER2-overexpressing cells to tamoxifen; (iii) instead
of known corepressors N-CoR and SMRT, MED1 and p-MED1
are recruited to ERa target gene promoters by tamoxifen in
HER2-overexpressing cells; (iv) knockdown of MED1 or

required for its optimal expression. Taken together, these
ﬁndings support a key role for MED1 in HER2-mediated
tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer.
It has been previously reported that the MED1 gene is
localized on chromosome 17q12 and often coampliﬁes with
HER2 in human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors
examined (25, 35). Our studies here provided further evidence
that MED1 protein expression levels strongly correlate with
HER2 status by using human breast cancer TMAs. Importantly,
we found that overexpression of HER2 alone is sufﬁcient to
induce MED1 phosphorylation at Thr (1032), a key site that is
known to be critical for its functions, whereas blockage of
HER2 or its downstream MAP kinase diminishes its phosphorylation levels in these cells. HER2 overexpression has been
reported to be one of the major mechanisms for tamoxifen
resistance of ERa-positive breast cancer cells (10, 11, 16, 20–
22). Because our own and others' studies have established
MED1 as a key transcriptional coactivator for ERa, we decided
to further examine the role of MED1 in tamoxifen resistance of
these cells. Indeed, we found that knockdown of MED1 signiﬁcantly sensitizes the HER2-overexpressing cells to tamoxifen. Although our studies here focus on HER2, we should also
mention that tamoxifen resistance has also been linked to a
number of other kinases [e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), IGF1R, and c-Src; refs. 9, 46–48]. As they are also known
to activate the MAP kinase pathway, it is conceivable that
MED1 could also be phosphorylated and play a role in these
kinase-mediated tamoxifen resistances.
In the presence of tamoxifen, ERa is known to preferentially
bind and recruit transcriptional corepressors N-CoR and
SMRT to target gene promoters. Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of tamoxifen critically depends on the recruitment of these corepressors, whereas reducing the levels of NCoR and SMRT can instead convert tamoxifen into an agonist
to stimulate endogenous ER target gene expression and cell
growth (43–45). Interestingly, in this study, we found MED1
and p-MED1, but not N-CoR and SMRT, are recruited to the

HER2/MED1 Cross-talk and Tamoxifen Resistance

ERa target gene promoter by tamoxifen in HER2-overexpressing cells. Importantly, blockage of HER2 signaling, knockdown
of MED1, or mutations of both phosphorylation sites of MED1
all could effectively prevent the recruitment of MED1 and pMED1, and restore N-CoR and SMRT to the promoter of ERa
target gene. Taken together, these evidences strongly support a
key role for HER2/MED1 cross-talk in tamoxifen resistance
through affecting the preferential recruitment of MED1/pMED1 versus N-CoR/SMRT by tamoxifen-bound ERa. However, one important question remaining is exactly how MED1
phosphorylation may lead to its recruitment to ERa target
gene promoters by tamoxifen. One possibility is that it could be
simply because of an increased MED1 protein level in these
cells rendered by its phosphorylation-induced stabilization.
Indeed, it has been previously proposed that the overall
balance of coactivators and corepressors levels is an important
determinant of the agonist or antagonist nature for tamoxifen
(43–45). An alternative or maybe even complement possibility
to this is that phosphorylation of MED1 may also lead to its
conformation changes, which can in turn increase its accessibility or may even render higher afﬁnity to tamoxifen-bound
ERa. Nevertheless, future structural studies on ERa interactions with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MED1,
in the presence of tamoxifen or estrogen, may be required to
gain further deep insights into this important question.
Recent genome-wide ChIP-seq studies have found that
activation of the growth factor signaling EGFR pathway by
EGF could lead to the binding of ERa to EGF-ERa target genes,
a distinct group of genes that are different from previously
reported E2 induced E2-ERa target genes (40). Importantly,
similar phenomena have most recently been further conﬁrmed
by using primary breast cancers from patients with different
endocrine responses and clinical outcomes (49). It is known
that ampliﬁed HER2 often forms complex with EGFR to
activate its downstream signaling pathways. Importantly,
these EGF-ERa target genes have been found to be overexpressed in HER2 overexpressing cells and are proposed to
play important roles in mediating endocrine resistance of
HER2 positive cells. Signiﬁcantly, we found MED1 is not only
recruited to E2-ERa target genes but also to EGF-ERa target
genes, and are required for the expression of both these target
genes. These results suggest that MED1 could potentially be
used as an advantageous therapeutic target to block both these
pathways for the treatment of tamoxifen resistant human
breast cancer. Importantly, as MED1 functions at one of the

last steps right before transcription starts, targeting MED1
could effectively block these EGF-ERa and E2-ERa target
genes, even if other HER2 and ERa downstream components,
cofactors, or even ERa itself is misregulated or activated.
Furthermore, as we have found that MED1 could also regulate
the expression of HER2 itself, targeting MED1 could also
simultaneously attenuate the activation of the HER2 pathway
in these cells. Moreover, our most recently published data
revealed a previously unexpected tissue- and gene-speciﬁc role
for MED1 in vivo, and showed that disruption of MED1 resulted
in an impaired estrogen response in breast, but not in uterus
and bone (30). Most importantly, recent studies found that
MED1 expression highly correlates with poor clinical outcome
of breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy (49).
Thus, targeting MED1 in a combined therapy with lower doses
of tamoxifen may also result in selective inhibition of these
pathways in the breast and overcome the severe adverse effects
of currently used high dose tamoxifen regimens.
