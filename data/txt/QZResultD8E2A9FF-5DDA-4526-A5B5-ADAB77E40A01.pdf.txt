Abstract

Author Manuscript

Activation of oncogenes by mechanisms other than genetic aberrations such as mutations,
translocations, or amplifications is largely undefined. Here we report a novel isoform of the
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is expressed in ~ 11% of melanomas and sporadically in
other human cancer types, but not in normal tissues. The novel ALK transcript initiates from a de
novo alternative transcription initiation (ATI) site in ALK intron 19, and was termed ALKATI. In
ALKATI-expressing tumours, the ATI site is enriched for H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II,
chromatin marks characteristic of active transcription initiation sites1. ALKATI is expressed from
both ALK alleles, and no recurrent genetic aberrations are found at the ALK locus, indicating that
the transcriptional activation is independent of genetic aberrations at the ALK locus. The ALKATI
transcript encodes three proteins with molecular weights of 61.1, 60.8 and 58.7 kilodaltons,
consisting primarily of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. ALKATI stimulates multiple
oncogenic signalling pathways, drives growth-factor-independent cell proliferation in vitro, and
promotes tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse models. ALK inhibitors can suppress the kinase activity
of ALKATI, suggesting that patients with ALKATI-expressing tumours may benefit from ALK
inhibitors. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer through de
novo alternative transcription initiation.

Author Manuscript

To identify novel mechanisms of oncogene activation, we performed transcriptome analyses
(RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)) of metastatic melanoma and thyroid carcinoma. We used an
algorithm2 to investigate the differential expression of exons and focused our analysis on
receptor tyrosine kinases with high expression of the kinase domain. In two melanoma
(MM-15, MM-74) and one anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC-28) samples, we identified a
novel ALK transcript, which contained the ALK exons 20–29 preceded by ~400 base pairs
(bp) of intron 19, but not exons 1–19. The novel ALK transcript was distinct from wild-type
ALK, which contains all exons, and from ALK translocations, which usually encompass
exons 20–29 with little intronic expression due to preserved splice sites (Fig. 1a and

Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). We confirmed the presence of the novel ALK transcript with a
northern blot (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).
The RNA-seq profile of the novel ALK transcript suggested an alternative transcription
initiation site in intron 19, and we termed the novel transcript ALKATI. We performed 5′rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) and mapped the ATI site to a 25 bp region in
intron 19 (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2c–e and Supplementary Table 1). ChIP-seq and
ChIP-qPCR showed that only ALKATI-expressing tumours, but not controls, had significant
enrichment of histone H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II (RNApol II) at the ATI site, which
are typical of active promoters1 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). These data suggest
that ALKATI originates from a newly established bona fide ATI site associated with
characteristic chromatin alterations.

Author Manuscript

To determine the prevalence of ALKATI expression, we screened more than 5,000 samples
from 15 different cancer types in the TCGA RNA-seq data set. ALKATI was expressed in ~
11% of melanoma and sporadically in other cancer types (Extended Data Table 1). We
found no ALKATI expression in more than 1,600 samples from 43 different normal tissues in
the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-seq data set3, indicating that ALKATI is
primarily expressed in a subset of cancer. To accurately distinguish and quantify the
expression of ALKATI, wild-type ALK, and translocated ALK in clinical specimens, we
developed a NanoString nCounter assay4 with probes in ALK exons 1–19, intron 19, and
exons 20–29, and identified additional ALKATI-expressing tumours derived from formalinfixed paraffin-embedded clinical specimens (Fig. 1d).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether somatic genomic aberrations at the ALK locus contribute to the
establishment of the de novo ATI site, we performed comprehensive genetic analyses
including interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH), whole-genome sequencing, and ultra-deep sequencing of the ALK
locus, but found no genomic aberrations that could account for the de novo expression of
ALKATI (Extended Data Figs 4a–d and 5a–c, and Supplementary Tables 2–4). Reasoning
that local genomic aberrations are usually cis-acting and only alter the expression of the
affected allele5, we analysed the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the DNA-, RNA-, and
ChIP-seq data. In all three data sets, we found similar allelic SNV frequencies, indicating
that H3K4me3 decorates both ALK alleles and that both ALK alleles are actively transcribed
(Fig. 1e). These data suggest that the transcriptional activation of ALKATI is independent of
genomic aberrations at the ALK locus, and that alteration of trans-acting elements, such as
transcription factors or chromatin modifiers, may contribute to ALKATI expression.

Author Manuscript

The ATI region contains transposable elements, including a long terminal repeat (LTR) in
ALK intron 19 and a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) in intron 18, both of which
can regulate transcription6 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To evaluate whether CpG methylation
of these elements might be associated with ALKATI expression, we performed bisulfite
sequencing. Compared to the controls, the ALKATI-expressing samples showed lower CpG
methylation in regions flanking the ATI site, including the LINE (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d).
The LTR contained only few CpG sites with low methylation levels in all samples. As
expected, we found H3K27ac, a histone mark characteristic of active promoters and

enhancers, enriched at the ATI site of ALKATI-expressing tumour samples. Surprisingly,
H3K27ac was also enriched in ALKATI-negative melanoma samples, but not in the control
lung cancer cell lines or the 17 non-melanoma cell lines analysed by the ENCODE
consortium7 (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f). By integrating ChIP, DNase I hypersensitivity, and
5′-RACE data, we defined the proximal cis-regulatory region on chromosome 2 as
chr2:29,445,000–29,447,100 and computationally determined the potential transcription
factor binding motifs8 (Supplementary Table 5). To test whether the LTR could function as
a promoter, we used a luciferase reporter assay and found that, in contrast to lung cancer cell
lines, melanoma cell lines showed low but consistent luciferase activity (Extended Data Fig.
6g). These data suggest that melanomas with H3K27ac enrichment at the ATI site might be
primed to express ALKATI.

Author Manuscript

The ALKATI transcript has three predicted in-frame start codons (ATGs), resulting in
proteins with molecular weights of 61.1, 60.8, and 58.7 kilodaltons (kDa). All three proteins
maintain the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, but lack the extracellular and
transmembrane domains of wild-type ALK (Fig. 2a). Immunoblots of two neuroblastoma
cell lines (SK-N-BE2, SK-N-DZ) expressing wild-type ALK and two lung cancer cell lines
(H3122 and H2228) expressing two distinct variants of the EML4–ALK gene fusion showed
bands at the expected sizes. ALKATI-expressing tumours revealed a double band at ~ 60
kDa, suggesting that ALKATI is translated from more than one start codon (Fig. 2b). To
confirm our prediction, we mutated the three start codons individually or in combination,
and expressed them in 293T cells. Immunoblots revealed that each mutated form of ALKATI
no longer produced the corresponding protein band, indicating that all three start codons in
ALKATI are functional and give rise to three distinct proteins (Fig. 2c).

ALKATI proteins were phosphorylated in tumours with endogenous ALKATI expression and
in cells with exogenous ALKATI expression (Fig. 2b, c), indicating that ALKATI is active.
ALK activity was confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay (Extended Data Fig. 7a). A kinasedead ALKATI (ALKATI-KD), in which a lysine in the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain
was replaced by a methionine9, was not phosphorylated or active. Reasoning that ALKATI
may auto-activate by forming homodimers similar to other receptor tyrosine kinases10, we
tested the ability of self-interaction using co-immunoprecipitation with V5- and HA-tagged
ALKATI proteins. The V5–ALKATI readily co-immunoprecipitated with the HA–ALKATI
and vice versa, indicating that ALKATI can self-interact, resulting in auto-phosphorylation
and kinase activity (Fig. 2d). Using immunofluorescence, we detected ALKATI in both the
nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas ALK with the F1174L mutation (ALKF1174) and
EML4–ALK were found mainly in the cytoplasm and/or at the cell membrane (Fig. 2e).
ALK immunohistochemistry in clinical samples confirmed the nuclear and cytoplasmic
localization of ALKATI, suggesting that detection of nuclear ALK expression by
immunohistochemistry could be used as a simple bio-marker to identify ALKATI-expressing
tumours (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 7b).
To establish the functional consequences of ALKATI expression, we stably transduced
Ba/F3, NIH-3T3 and melan-a cells with ALKATI, negative controls (ALKATI-KD and empty
vector), and positive controls (oncogenic ALK variants ALKF1174L, EML4–ALK, and wild
type). In interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells, expression of ALKATI and the positive

controls, but not the negative controls, led to IL-3-independent proliferation (Fig. 3a). We
confirmed that ALKATI was expressed at similar levels in the transformed ALKATI-Ba/F3
cells to those in human tumours, and that all ALK isoforms were phosphorylated when
expressed at levels required for IL-3-independent growth (Fig. 3b). In competition assays,
only Ba/F3 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) co-expressed from the ALK
expression vectors were growing under IL-3-independent growth conditions, indicating that
the Ba/F3 cell transformation was driven by expression of the ALK variants (Extended Data
Fig. 7c). Consistently, ALKATI-expressing NIH-3T3 and melan-a cells efficiently induced
tumour growth in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Fig. 3c and
Extended Data Fig. 7d–f).

Author Manuscript

All cells expressing ALK variants (ALKATI, ALKF1174L, EML4–ALK, and wild-type ALK)
were able to establish growth-factor-independent proliferation and tumorigenesis with
similar growth rates once the tumours were established. The observed oncogenic capacity of
wild-type ALK is consistent with previous reports that high endogenous expression or
genomic amplification of ALK drives oncogenesis and confers sensitivity to ALK inhibitors
in neuroblastomas11–16. To explore the functional consequences of ALKATI expression
further, we stably transduced NIH-3T3 cells with either a low or high titre of ALKATI,
resulting in cells expressing ALKATI either at low or at high levels. We found that a further
increase in ALKATI expression levels did not accelerate tumour graft establishment and
growth, indicating that ALKATI can drive tumorigenesis once a threshold of expression is
reached (Extended Data Fig. 7g–i).

Author Manuscript

To examine the therapeutic responses to pharmacological ALK inhibition, we treated Ba/F3
cells stably expressing various ALK isoforms with three different ALK inhibitors (crizotinib,
ceritinib, and TAE-684). All three ALK inhibitors effectively inhibited IL-3-independent
growth of the transformed Ba/F3 cells, whereas they had no effect on growth in the presence
of IL-3 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Crizotinib inhibited ALKATI phosphorylation
and downstream signalling in a concentration-dependent manner, further corroborating that
ALKATI is activated through auto-phosphorylation (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8c–e).
Crizotinib treatment induced regression of ALKATI-driven NIH-3T3 tumours in vivo, and
immunohistochemistry of explanted tumours confirmed reduced cell proliferation, increased
apoptosis, and inhibition of several oncogenic signalling pathways (Fig. 4c–e and Extended
Data Fig. 9a–f).

Author Manuscript

On the basis of our pre-clinical data, we identified a patient with ALKATI-expressing
metastatic melanoma (Fig. 4f, g). A clinical sequencing assay17, which evaluates 341
cancer-related genes for genomic aberrations, and FISH to assess ALK rearrangements and
MET amplifications, revealed deletions of CDKN2A and PTEN (Extended Data Fig. 9g–i).
The patient had previously progressed on a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab
immunotherapy in a clinical trial, followed by palliative radiation and dacarbazine
chemotherapy. Subsequent treatment with crizotinib resulted in marked symptomatic
improvement and tumour shrinkage within 6 weeks of therapy (Fig. 4h).
Taken together, we have identified a novel ALK transcript, ALKATI, which arises
independently of genomic aberrations at the ALK locus through alternative transcription

initiation. ALKATI-driven tumours are sensitive to ALK inhibitors, suggesting that patients
harbouring such tumours may benefit from ALK inhibitor therapy. Importantly, we have
discovered alternative transcription initiation as a novel mechanism for oncogene activation.
Additional oncogenes may be activated via similar mechanisms in other human
malignancies, and their identification may provide new insights into oncogenesis and
opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

METHODS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
Human tumour samples

Author Manuscript

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards and Ethics Committees of
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York and informed consent was obtained
from all subjects (#12–245 and #00–144). Representative portions of excised tumours were
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, or fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and processed using routine histological methods and stained with haematoxylin
and eosin.
RNA sequencing

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue sections (17 metastatic melanomas and 6
thyroid carcinomas) using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The isolated RNA was processed
using the TruSeq RNA sample Prep kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform with 50, 75, or 100bp
paired-end reads to obtain on average 40,000,000–100,000,000 reads per sample.
Sequencing data was mapped to hg19, and analysed using publicly available software
packages: SAMtools18, Tophat19, GATK20, Picard (http://picard.sourcefor-ge.net), and
IGV21.
Screening for aberrantly expressed kinases
For initial screening of RNA-seq data, candidate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes were
defined by Gene Ontology annotation GO:0004714 as found in AmiGO22. DEXSeq2 was
used to calculate exon level counts using RTK Ensembl Gene IDs. For each gene the ratio of
reads in the first half of the gene to the second half was calculated. ALK was identified as the
top hit.
Analysis of public data sets

Author Manuscript

RNA-seq data were downloaded from the Broad Institute GTEx Genotype-Tissue
Expression Portal (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gtex/). Level 3 TCGA data was
downloaded from the Broad Institute TCGA GDAC Firehose (http://
gdac.broadinstitute.org/) 2013_09_23 run using exon_quantification data from
illuminahiseq_rnaseqv2__unc_udu. ALKATI candidates were identified as samples with an
ALK expression level of RSEM ≥100, ≥ 500 total reads across all ALK exons, and ≥10-fold
greater average expression in exons 20–29 compared to exons 1–19. To confirm ALKATI
expression, candidates were manually examined in IGV21. ENCODE ChIP-seq data for

Promoter/motif analysis
The proximal cis-regulatory region, chr2:29,445,000–29,447,100, was scanned for
transcription factor motifs using FIMO8 with default parameters against the known
vertebrate transcription factor motifs in the JASPAR database23.
5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE)

Author Manuscript

We used two independent 5′-RACE techniques and three ALKATI-expressing tumours
(MM-15, MM-74, and ATC-28) to map the ATI site and the 5′-end of the ALKATI transcript.
We applied a tobacco-acid-pyrophosphatase 5′-RACE technique according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Epicentre) using the following primers: 5′TCATACACATACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAGCGGCCGCCTGCAGGAAA-3′; 5′CAGGTCACTGATGGAGGAGGTCTTGCCAGCAAAGCA-3′. RACE products were
sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq System with a 150 bp paired-end protocol according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing reads were mapped to hg19 using BWA and
visualized using IGV21. We confirmed the continuous transcription starting in ALK intron
19 with an independent oligonucleotide-based 5′-RACE kit (Clontech) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol using the primers 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′, 5′ACACCTGGCCTTCATACACCTCC-3′. We cloned the RACE cDNA products into
plasmids (Invitrogen) and analysed them with Sanger sequencing. Two lung cancer cell lines
(H3122 and H2228) with EML4–ALK translocations were used as controls.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP-qPCR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Chromatin was isolated from human tumour tissue and cell lines. Fresh-frozen human
tumour tissue (MM-15, MM-74, and ATC-28) was sectioned with a microtome and crosslinked in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-linked tissue samples were quenched
in 125 mM glycine, washed in PBS, re-suspended in lysis buffer, ground in a Tenbroeckstyle tissue grinder, and sonicated. Chromatin isolation from cell lines and
immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described24. Solubilized chromatin was
immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and RNApol II (all
Active Motif). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 51 bp single
reads. Reads were aligned to hg19 using Bowtie within the Illumina Analysis Pipeline. Peak
calling was performed using MACS 1.4 comparing immunoprecipitated chromatin with
input chromatin25. ChIP-qPCR was performed on a ViiA 7 Real Time PCR System (Life
Technologies) using Power SYBR Master Mix (Life Technology) with 3 technical replicates
and 5 independent primers pairs, which are specified in Supplementary Table 6.
Ultra-deep targeted sequencing of the entire ALK locus and MSK-IMPACT
Targeted sequencing of the entire ALK locus was performed using custom hybridization
capture probes tiling hg19 chr2:29,400,000–30,300,000 (Roche/NimbleGen’s SeqCap EZ).
This region encompassed the entire genomic footprint of ALK and ~ 150 kb of upstream
sequence. After the genomic DNA was fragmented (E220, Covaris), we prepared barcoded

sequence libraries (New England Biolabs, Kapa Biosystems) and performed hybridization
capture on barcoded pools. Using 250 ng of genomic DNA, we constructed libraries from 7
separate samples: 2 melanomas (MM-15 and MM-74), 1 anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
(ATC-28), 2 lung cancer cell lines (H3122 and H2228) with EML4–ALK translocations, 1
melanoma cell line (SKMEL-28), and 1 control pool of 10 ‘normal’ blood samples.
Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations (100 ng per library) and used in the
capture reaction as previously described26. To prevent off-target hybridization, we added a
pool of spike-in blocker oligonucleotides complementary to the full sequences of all
barcoded adaptors. The captured libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to
generate 75 bp paired-end reads. Sequence data were de-multiplexed using CASAVA, and
aligned to hg19 using BWA27. Local realignment and quality score recalibration were
performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) according to GATK best
practices28. We achieved mean unique target sequence coverage of 1,778 × per sample
(range: 1,293–2,188×). Sequence data were analysed to identify single nucleotide variants,
small insertions/deletions (indels), and structural rearrangements. Single nucleotide variants
were called using muTect29 and were compared to the negative control pool (pooled
‘normal’ blood samples). Variants were retained if the variant allele frequency in the tumour
was >5 times than in the negative control and the frequency in the negative control was
<0.02. Validated SNPs in the dbSNP database were filtered out. Indels were called using the
SomaticIndelDetector tool in GATK28 and were retained if the tumour harboured >3
supporting reads and the frequency in the negative control was <0.02. DELLY was used to
search for structural rearrangements30. Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation
Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) was performed as described
previously17.

Bisulfite sequencing of the entire ALK locus

Author Manuscript

We performed custom capture of the entire ALK locus using custom hybridization capture
probes tiling the entire genomic footprint of ALK (900 kb, chr2:29,400,000–30,300,000)
followed by bisulfite sequencing. After fragmentation (E220, Covaris) of 3 μg genomic
DNA of each sample (MM-15, ATC-28, H3122, and SKMEL-28), libraries were prepared
with the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems) without PCR amplification to preserve
the methylation status. Of each barcoded library, 1 μg was pooled at equimolar
concentrations and captured according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche/NimbleGen’s
SeqCap EZ). After washing the Dynabeads M-270 (Life Technologies), the non-biotinylated
tumour/cell line DNA was dissociated from the biotinylated capture beads with 0.5MNaOH.
The single-stranded eluted DNA was used for bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA
Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, except for
the 98 °C denaturation step. After bisulfite conversion, we used the KAPA HiFi Uracil PCR
polymerase (Kapa Biosystems) to amplify the library, purified the reaction with Agencourt
AMPure XP beads (A63881, Beckman Coulter), and sequenced the library on an Illumina
MiSeq with a 150 bp paired-end protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence data were aligned to hg19 and analysed using Bismark31. We compared the
methylation level at CpG sites across all samples; no methylation was detected in the CHG
and CHH contexts. Methylation was first computed as the number of methylated CpG reads
vs the number of total reads covering each CpG site (sites with < 10 reads were excluded). A

sliding window was used to determine the mean methylation level for every 250 bp region
(with at least three CpGs) near the ALK promoter region (chr2:29,444,000–29,452,000).
Differential methylation was evaluated using a Mann–Whitney test.

Allelic frequencies SNVs at the ALK locus

Whole-genome sequencing was performed at the New York Genome Center. Briefly,
genomic DNA libraries were prepared from MM-15 and ATC-28 (no matched normal DNA
was available) using the Illumina PCR-free kit. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 using the 100bp paired-end whole-genome sequencing protocol. Sequence reads
were mapped using BWA27 and processed using GATK28. Genome-wide analyses of
mutations (HaplotypeCaller28), copy number alterations (FREEC)32, and structural
variations (CREST)33 were performed. Mutations were annotated with the Ensembl Variant
Effect Predictor34 and filtered to remove common polymorphisms. Non-synonymous
mutations along with copy number alterations and structural variations were visualized using
Circos35.

DNA-seq, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq (H3K4me3) data were displayed in the Integrative
Genomics Viewer and the allelic frequencies were compared for each single nucleotide
variant (SNV).

probes. Slides were scanned using a microarray scanner G2505B (Agilent) and analysed
using Genomic Workbench (Agilent).
Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
ALK break-apart probes and locus-specific probes for MET and for centromere 7 were
purchased from Abbott. The probes were hybridized on 5-μm-thick tissue sections and the
number and localization of the hybridization signals was assessed in a minimum of 100
interphase nuclei with well-delineated contours.
Northern blots

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue or cell lines using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). Up to 10 μg RNA was used for running formaldehyde-based northern blot
analysis according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the RNA Ambion NorthernMax Kit
(Ambion). After hybridization with a32 P-labelled probe, consisting of ALK exon 20–29, the
membrane was washed and visualized.
NanoString
Details of the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies) were reported
previously36. In brief, two sequence-specific probes were constructed for ALK exons 1–19,
intron 19, and exons 20–29, respectively. Four control genes (RPS13, RPL27, RPS20, and

the target mRNA and are listed in Supplementary Table 7. 100ng of total RNA from each
sample was hybridized, the raw data were normalized to the standard curve generated via the
nCounter system, and the average value of the two probes in each target region (exons 1–19,
intron 19, exons 20–29) was printed in bar charts using GraphPad Prism software 6.0.
NanoString experiments were independently performed at least twice with appropriate
positive and negative controls, and a representative experiment is shown.
Cell lines

Author Manuscript

The NIH-3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (#CRL-1658) and the two neuroblastoma
cell lines, SK-N-DZ (#CRL-2149) and SK-N-BE2 (#CRL-2271), were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium (DMEM). The lung carcinoma cell lines H2228 (#CRL-5935, ATCC) and H3122
(NCI, Bethesda, MD) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI).
The IL-3-dependent murine pro B-cell line, Ba/F3, was obtained from the ‘Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen’ (DSMZ) and was cultured in RPMI
supplemented with 1 ngml−1 IL-3 (R&D). The melanoma cell lines A375, A2058, and
Colo800 were provided by the laboratory of J. Massagué and were cultured in DMEM. The
melanoma cell lines 501 mel and WW94 were provided by the laboratory of L. Garraway
and were cultured in DMEM. SKMEL-23, SKMEL-28, SKMEL-31, and SKMEL-524 are
patient-derived melanoma cell lines established at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
and were cultured in RPMI. Melan-a cells were provided by D. Bennett (St. George’s
Hospital, University of London, London, UK)37 and were maintained in RPMI
supplemented with 200 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Cell Signaling).
For retrovirus production, 293T cells were purchased (Clontech) and cultured in DMEM.
All cell culture media contained 10% FBS, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 Uml−1),
and streptomycin (100 μg ml−1). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and were
biochemically tested negative for mycoplasma contamination every 4–8 weeks (Lonza).
After receiving the cell lines from the indicated sources, the cell lines were not further
authenticated, but showed the expected genomic aberrations, such as EML4-ALK
translocations. The genomic aberrations have been validated by various methods, including
RNA-seq or northern blot.

Plasmids

Author Manuscript

For the ALKATI vector, RNA from MM-15 was reverse-transcribed with anchored oligo(dT)
primers into cDNA (Roche), PCR amplified with ALK the primers 5′CACCATCCCATCTCCAGTCTGCTTC-3′, 5′-AGAGAAGTGAGTGTGCGACC-3′, and
cloned into a pENTR vector (Life Technologies). The full-length ALK plasmid
(HsCD00079531) was purchased from the DF/HCC DNA Resource Core (http://
plasmid.med.harvard.edu) and EML4–ALKv1 was synthesized at GeneArt (Life
Technologies). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange (Agilent): for
kinase-dead ALKATI (ALKATI-KD), we mutated the lysine in the ATP-binding site of the
kinase domain to methionine (p.K1150M referring to wild-type ALK) in ALKATI, and for
ALKF1174L a p.F1174L mutation was introduced into wild-type ALK. Plasmids were subcloned into pMIG-w backbones38 (http://www.addgene.org), resulting in MSCV-ALKvariantNature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 24.

IRES-GFP constructs, which were confirmed by digestion and sequencing. To confirm the
start codons, we mutated the three start codons from ATG to AAG individually or in
combination as indicated. For co-immunoprecipitation, ALKATI was subcloned into
pcDNA3.1/nV5-Dest (Life Technologies) and MSCV–N-HA–FLAG-Dest (Addgene). For
bioluminescence imaging, we used a triple modality retroviral reporter plasmid (red
fluorescent protein (RFP)–thymidine-kinase–luciferase)39.
Stable gene expression

Author Manuscript

Retrovirus was produced in 293T cells by standard methods using ecotropic or amphotropic
packaging vectors and XtremeGene 9 (Roche). We harvested the virus-containing
supernatant 48, 64 and 72 h after transfection. The supernatant was pooled, filtered through
a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane, and used for transduction in the presence of polybrene (8 μg
ml−1). Stable eGFP- or RFP-expressing cells were sorted with a FACSAria II (BD
Biosciences).
Co-immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

V5–ALKATI and HA–ALKATI was transiently transfected into 293T cells using
XtremeGene 9 (Roche), and after 24 h, cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1%
Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and proteinase/
phosphatase inhibitors. After incubation and centrifugation, 100 μl supernatant was used as
input, and 300 μl for immunoprecipitation using the following antibodies: 2 μg of anti-V5
antibody (Thermo Scientific), 10 μl of EZview Red anti-HA Affinity Gel (Sigma), 2 μg of
anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz). We used 20 μl of Protein A/G UltraLink Resin (Thermo
Scientific) for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated material was eluted in 4× SDS
loading buffer for immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation was independently performed
twice and a representative immunoblot is shown in Fig. 2d.
In vitro kinase assay

Author Manuscript

Stably transduced NIH-3T3 cells were grown in a 15 cm dish, washed with PBS, and lysed
in 20mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1% NP-40, 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA with
proteinase/phosphatase inhibitor. Lysates were incubated on ice, centrifuged, pre-cleared
with 25 μl Protein A/G UltraLink Resin (Thermo Scientific) for 30min at 4 °C under
rotation, and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl ALK (D5F3) XP Rabbit monoclonal antibody
and 25 μl Protein A/G UltraLink Resin. After rotation for 120 min at 4 °C, the
immunoprecipitated material was washed and used according to the instructions of
Universal Tyrosine Kinase Assay Kit (Clontech). After the enzymatic reaction, the
immunoprecipitated material was mixed with 4×SDS loading buffer for immunoblotting. In
vitro kinase assays were performed in quadruplicates, independently repeated three times,
and a representative experiment is shown.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tumour specimens using a standard multimer/diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection protocol on
a Discovery Ultra system (Roche/Ventana) with appropriate negative and positive controls.

luciferase vector (Promega). To determine the promoter activity of LTR16B2, 105 cells were
transfected in triplicates with 500 ng pGL4.14-LTR16B2 or vector alone; as internal control,
200 ng pRL-TK-Renilla luciferase reporter vector (Promega) was co-transfected. Luciferase
activity was measured using Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) 48 h after
transfection. Promoter activity was calculated by normalizing firefly luciferase activity to
the control Renilla luciferase activity and compared between pGL4.14-LTR16B2 and vector
alone. The luciferase reporter assays were independently performed three times, the results
were combined, and the mean ± s.d. is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6g.
Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

Author Manuscript

Flow cytometry analysis for in vitro transformation assays with Ba/F3 cells was performed
on an LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) at day 0 and day 14 after IL-3 withdrawal. GFP-or
RFP-positive cells were sorted using the FITC (blue laser) or PE (yellow laser) channel,
respectively, on a FACSAria II configured with 5 lasers (BD Biosciences).
In vitro transformation and drug treatment assays

Author Manuscript

Stably transduced Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with IL-3 (1 ng
ml−1). For the cell proliferation assay, Ba/F3 cells were transferred into IL-3 depleted RPMI
medium, and cell growth was quantified in quadruplicates every 2–4 days by a luminescence
assay (Promega). For cell viability assays and ALK inhibitor–dose-response curves, 2,000
Ba/F3 cells were plated in triplicates in 96-well plates with increasing concentrations of the
ALK inhibitors crizotinib (LC laboratories), TAE-684 (ChemieTek), or ceritinib
(ChemieTek) as indicated. All drugs were re-suspended in DMSO. The cell viability was
assessed after 72 h by a luminescence assay (Promega). Results were normalized to cell
growth in medium containing an equivalent concentration of DMSO. The inhibition curve
was determined with GraphPad Prism 6.0 software using the ‘log(inhibitor) vs response –
variable slope’ nonlinear regression model. For immunoblots, 10 million Ba/F3 cells were
harvested after 2 h treatment with crizotinib, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA
buffer. All assays were independently performed at least twice and a representative
experiment is shown.
In vivo tumorigenicity and drug treatment assays

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by MSKCC
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#11-12-029). The size for each cohort was
determined based on previous experience without specific statistical methods. We resuspended 106 cells of stably transfected NIH-3T3 or melan-a cells in 50 μl of 1:1 mix of
PBS and Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and subcutaneously and bilaterally injected the cells
into the flanks of 6–8 weeks old female CB17-SCID mice (Taconic). Mice were chosen
randomly and no animals were excluded. For tumour growth assays, 5 mice were injected
with parental or stably transduced cell lines and 10 tumours were assessed (expect of melana cells stably transfected with ALKF1174L, in which 4 mice were injected and 8 tumours
were assessed). Tumour sizes were measured with callipers, without blinding, every 2 to 7
days for a period of up to 100 days, and were calculated using the following formula:
tumour volume = (D ×d2)/2, whereby D and d refer to the long and short tumour diameter,

respectively. For in vivo drug sensitivity studies, 9 mice were injected with the stably
transduced NIH-3T3 cells expressing a luciferase reporter construct and the indicated
plasmids. When the tumours reached an average size of 200–250 mm3, mice were
randomized into a vehicle (4 mice) or treatment (5 mice) group. Mice were orally gavaged
once a day with crizotinib (100 mg kg−1 per day) or vehicle. We performed non-blinded
measurement of 8 tumours in the vehicle group and 10 tumours in the crizotinib group with
callipers every 2 to 3 days, and growth curves were visualized with Prism GraphPad 6.0. In
parallel, we monitored tumour growth by bioluminescence imaging of anaesthetized mice by
retro-orbital injection of D-luciferin (150 mg per kg body weight) and imaging with the
IVIS Spectrum Xenogen machine (Caliper Life Sciences). Bioluminescence analysis was
performed using Living Image software, version 2.50. After euthanizing the mice, tumours
were explanted and either lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) or fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining or immunohistochemistry. Mice experiments were
performed once.

recurrent genomic aberrations at the ALK locus

Author Manuscript

a, Ultra-deep sequencing data of the ALK locus are displayed in IGV. The genomic region
around intron 19 reveals several single nucleotide variations (SNVs). However, the vast
majority of SNVs at the ALK locus are also found in the general population as they are
detected in the pool of normal DNA, which was used as the control (pooled normal, bottom
panel). Numerous SNVs are also documented in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
database (dbSNP; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). No genomic aberrations were found
at the transcription initiation site of ALKATI. Supplementary Table 2 shows the detected
SNVs and indels at the ALK locus after filtering out SNPs documented in the dbSNP
database. None of the genomic aberrations was found in more than one case, indicating that
the expression of ALKATI is probably not caused by alterations of the DNA nucleotide
sequence. b, c, Circos plots of the whole-genome sequencing data of MM-15 (b) and
