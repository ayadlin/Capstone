ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is believed to result from the interplay of genetic and
non-genetic risk factors, and individual genetic variation may influence the efficacy
of chemotherapy. Here we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with response to anthracyclineand taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. In
the discovery stage, we divided 92 patients who received anthracycline-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy into 2 groups according to pathologic response and
performed a genome-wide study using Affymetrix SNP6.0 genechip. Of 389,795 SNPs
associated with pathologic complete response (pCR), we identified 2 SNPs, rs6044100
and rs1799937, that were significantly associated with pCR after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. In the validation stage, genotype analysis of samples from an
independent cohort of 401 patients who received anthracycline-based neoadjuvant
regimens and 467 patients who received taxane-based regimens was performed using
sequencing analysis. We found that only SNP rs1799937, located in the WT1 gene,
was associated with pCR after anthracycline-based neoadjuvant therapy (AA vs GG;
odds ratio [OR], 2.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–6.98; P < 0.05) but not
after taxane-based neoadjuvant therapy (AA vs GG; OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.36–2.04;
P = 0.72). These results suggest that WT1 may be a potential target of anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer.

of the genetic component of breast cancer [1]. Genetic
association studies, such as genome-wide association
studies (GWASs), have identified low-penetrance common
variants (predominantly single nucleotide polymorphisms
[SNPs]) associated with breast cancer risk. Since the first 3
GWASs that identified SNPs associated with breast cancer
susceptibility were conducted in early 2007 [2–4], over 80
loci associated with increased breast cancer risk have been
found [5–16]. These studies have suggested that high-

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common malignant
neoplasm among women in the world. It is believed to
result from a complex interplay of genetic and non-genetic
risk factors. Linkage and family-based studies have
shown that germline mutations of high- and moderatepenetrance genes such as BRCA1/2, PTEN, ATM,
CHEK2, TP53, PALB2, and BRIP1 account for 20%–25%

and moderate-penetrance genes and GWAS-identified
low-penetrance common variants together may explain
about 50% of the familial risk of breast cancer [17].
Accumulating evidence has shown that certain genetic
variations are associated with response to chemotherapy in
patients with lung cancer [18, 19]. However, genetic variants
associated with tumor response to specific chemotherapy
regimens in breast cancer have rarely been studied [20–22].
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is increasingly used for operable
primary breast cancer because it yields survival rate at least
equal to those of adjuvant chemotherapy [23–25]. Some of
the most effective cytotoxic agents against breast cancer are
the anthracyclines, which have formed the backbone of most
adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens for more than 2 decades
[23, 26–29]. Another class of effective cytotoxic agents,
taxanes (such as paclitaxel and docetaxel), are also used as
standard therapy for breast cancer, as monochemotherapy,
in combination therapy, or in sequential therapy [30–32].
As neoadjuvant therapy, taxanes have produced dramatic
increases in response rates [33–35]. Still, only a minority of
patients achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) after
receiving either anthracycline- or taxane-based neoadjuvant
regimens. Given the lack of a preferred neoadjuvant
treatment regimen, identifying which patients are most
likely to respond to a specific regimen could significantly
improve breast cancer treatment outcomes and facilitate
the development of targeted therapies. Since GWASs have
been successful in identifying low-penetrance common
variants for breast cancer predisposition, several studies
have investigated the potential roles of GWAS-identified
SNPs in the choice of neoadjuvant therapy and evaluation of
patient prognosis [18, 19]. In the current GWAS, we aimed
to identify associations between SNPs associated with breast
cancer susceptibility and response to anthracycline- and
taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
breast cancer.

received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and were included in
the discovery or validation cohort are shown in Table 1.
In the discovery stage, the pCR rate was 32.6%. In the
validation stage, the pCR rate was15.5% in patients who
received anthracycline-based neoadjuvant therapy and
17.1% in those who received a taxane-based regimen.

Identification of SNPs
The discovery cohort included 92 patients who
each received 4 cycles of the anthracycline-based CTF
neoadjuvant regimen. pCR was used to differentiate
cases from controls. All individuals had < 10% of
missing genotypes, and all were genotyped as females
based on X-chromosome genotypes, and therefore all
were included. GWAS was performed using PLINK on
genotype data from 30 patients with pCR and 62 patients
with non-pCR. Of 389,795 SNPs included in the analysis,
351 SNPs showed significant associations with pCR. We
then employed 3 additional criteria to select SNPs for
inclusion in the validation stage. First, the 351 SNPs that
showed significant association with pCR were confirmed
using a genome-wide significance at P < 1e-03 (Figure 1).
Second, the data set was narrowed down to 32 SNPs that
are known to be related to genes that correlate with cancer
using a search of gene annotation databases and published
literature (ORs ranging from 2.89 [95% CI, 1.53–5.48]
to 6.14 [95% CI, 2.07–18.20]) (Table 2). Third, using
unadjusted univariate Cox proportional hazard models
(P < 0.05), we ended up with only 2 SNPs with a pCR
rate that was significantly higher for both homozygotes
(Table 3).
One of these two SNPs, rs1799937, is located in
an intron of the WT1 gene at 11p13; the A allele had an
OR of 3.33 (95% CI, 1.70–6.51) compared with the G
allele. The other SNP, rs6044100, is located in an intron
of the KIF16B gene at 20p11, and the T allele had an OR
of 4.05 (95% CI, 1.98–8.29) compared with the C allele.
We found significantly higher pCR rates in patients with
the rs1799937 AA genotype (60.0%) and the rs6044100
TT genotype (71.4%) than in patients with the rs1799937
GG genotype (16.7%) and the rs6044100 CC genotype
(16.4%) (Table 3).

Association of rs1799937genotype and response
to anthracycline-based regimens

Association between rs1799937genotype and
survival

Having confirming that the SNPs rs1799937 AA
genotype and rs6044100 TT genotype are associated with
pCR, we investigated the potential association between
these two genetic variants and pCR after anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We attempted to validate
rs1799937 and rs6044100 in an independent cohort of
401 patients who received CTF regimens by sequencing
analysis. The results showed that patients with the
rs1799937 AA genotype benefited from anthracycline-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy more than patients with the GG
genotype; the pCR rates of the AA versus GG genotypes
were 26.7% and 11.5%, respectively (P = 0.035). Logistic
regression models showed an odds ratio for patients with
the rs1799937 AA genotype compared with those with
the GG genotype of 2.81 (95% CI, 1.13–6.98; P = 0.026,
Table 4). However, no association was identified between
rs6044100 and pCR; the pCR rates after CTF therapy for
patients with the TT genotype versus those with the CC
genotype were 18.8% and 15.2%, respectively (P = 0.86).

Among the 493 patients who received CTF regimen,
including 92 from the discovery stage and 401 from the
validation stage, patients with the rs1799937 AA genotype
had a slightly higher but not statistically significant 5-year
recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate (89.3%; 95% CI,
79.5%-99.1%; AA vs GA+GG; P = 0.35) and 5-year
distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) rate (92.2%; 95%
CI,83.8%-100.1%; AA vs GA+GG; P = 0.31) than those with
the rs1799937 GG genotype (RFS, 84.0%; 95% CI, 79.1%88.9%; DRFS, 87.4%; 95% CI, 82.9%-91.9%; Figures 2a
and 2b). However, no difference in RFS and DRFS was
detected between rs1799937 AA versus GG genotype in
the 467 breast cancer patients treated with taxane-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Figures 2c and 2d).

DISCUSSION
We performed a GWAS to assess genetic variants
that may be associated with pCR in patients receiving
neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We identified
1 SNP, rs1799937 A > G, as a genetic variant associated
with response to anthracycline-based CTF neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Patients with the rs1799937 AA genotype
showed significantly higher rates of pCR and better
prognosis after treatment with CTF than patients with the
GG genotype. However, we found that the AA allele of
rs1799937 was not associated with sensitivity to taxanebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens.
The rs1799937 A > G SNP is located in an intron
region of the WT1 gene at 11p13. WT1 encodes a
transcription factor that contains 4 zinc-finger motifs

Association between rs1799937genotype and
response to taxane-based regimens
Further, we explored the association of rs1799937
with pCR in patients receiving taxane-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. Rs1799937 genotypes were assessed
by sequencing in an independent cohort of 467 patients
who received taxane-based regimens. No association was
observed between rs1799937 genotype and pCR status;
the two homozygous genotypes showed similar pCR rates
(17.1% vs 19.5%; P = 0.34, Table 5).

at the C-terminus and plays an important role in organ
development and cell survival [36]. In addition to
regulating nuclear transcription, WT1 is also involved
in RNA splicing and metabolism [37, 38]. WT1 was
first identified as a tumor suppressor gene in Wilms’
tumor. However, accumulating evidence has shown that
overexpression of WT1 exerts an oncogenic effect in other
tumors [36, 39, 40] and is linked to poor prognoses in
leukemia and breast cancer [41, 42].
Previous studies have also shown that WT1 gene
expresion is related to sensitivity to chemotherapy.
Perugorria et al. have reported that WT1 knockdown
markedly sensitized hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines
to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis [43]. Interestingly, the
effect of WT1 expression on apoptosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells seems to be specific to doxorubicin, and
not to other chemotherapeutic agents. Doxorubicin, an
anthracycline, is a potent inhibitor of Top2 isozymes and
exerts its genotoxic effect by impeding DNA duplication
[44–36]. We speculate that rs1799937 may function by
altering WT1 gene expression, thus rendering cancer
cells in patients with the AA allele more sensitive to
anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
In summary, our results indicate that anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy may benefit breast
cancer patients with the rs1799937 AA allele more than
those with the GG allele. Therefore, further investigation
of WT1 as a potential target of chemotherapy for breast
cancer is warranted.

non-pCR group. In the validation stage, 401 patients who
had received 2–6 cycles of CTF and 467 patients who
had received a taxane-based regimen using paclitaxel
were included.

Genotyping methods and quality control
In the discovery stage, we isolated DNA from
peripheral blood lymphocytes using phenol-chloroform
extraction and ultrapurification. Genotyping was
conducted using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human
SNP Array 6.0 chips (Santa Clara, CA). We performed
systematic quality control on the raw genotyping data
to filter out unqualified samples and SNPs. As quality
control, we excluded DNA samples that failed to be
genotyped as female based on X-chromosome genotypes.
SNPs were excluded if (1) they were not mapped on
autosomal chromosomes; (2) they had a call rate < 95%;
(3) they had minor allele frequency < 0.01; (4) they
deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at P < 1e05; or (5) their genotyping clusters had poor resolution.
These led to a total of 389,795 SNPs to be analyzed using
a GWAS toolset PLINK [47].
The genotypes of the patients with and without pCR
were compared. We selected SNPs that were (1) associated
with pCR in the discovery stage at P < 1e-03; (2) located
in genes that have been correlated with cancer in gene
annotation databases and published literature; and (3)
associated with pCR status in the discovery stage at P <
0.05 using unadjusted univariate Cox proportional hazard
models. Finally, 2 SNPs, rs1799937 and rs6044100, were
identified.
For the validation phase, genomic DNA samples
were extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of
an additional 868 patients, including 401 who received
anthracyclin-based regimens and 467 who received
taxane-based regimens. Genotyping of the samples was
conducted using a polymerase chain reaction/sequencing
assay (ABI 3730 system, Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection
The GWAS included 960 patients with breast cancer
who were treated at Peking University Cancer Hospital
between October 2003 and November 2011. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients, and
this study was approved by the Research and Ethical
Committee of Peking University Cancer Hospital.
The discovery stage included 92 patients from a
pool of 493 patients who had received 4 cycles of an
anthracycline-based neoadjuvant regimen consisting
of cyclophosphamide, pirarubicin (THPADM),
5-fluorouracil (CTF). This regimen included pirarubicin
35 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and day 8, cyclophosphamide
500 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and day 8, and 5-fluorouracil
200 mg/m2/day i.v. continuous infusion for 28 days,
every 4 weeks. All the 92 patients received an identical
CTF regimen with the same dosage and same number
of cycles. There was no bias in terms of any patient
characteristics. Using pCR, defined as the absence
of invasive breast tumor cells in the breast and
axillary lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, the patients were divided into 2 pathologic
response groups with 30 in the pCR group and 62 in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Association between SNPs and response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast
cancer was assessed using logistic regression models
and reported as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). ORs were estimated for heterozygotes
and homozygotes for the variant allele compared with
homozygotes for the common allele. A logistic regression
model was applied to determine whether a factor was an
independent predictor of pCR in a multivariate analysis.
Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier
curves. All statistical tests were two-sided. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS
Inc.,Chicago, IL).
