Abstract:

In the last 6 years, since the first reports of an association between somatic mutations
in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exons 19 and 21 and response to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
changed dramatically. Based on laboratory and clinical observations, investigators
have anticipated that these mutations could be predictive of response to EGFR TKIs and
numerous studies have confirmed that the presence of mutation was associated with
longer survival in patients receiving targeted therapy. Prospective trials comparing
standard platinum-based chemotherapy with EGFR TKIs in patients with and without
activating EGFR mutations validated the predictive value of molecular selection of
patients for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Recently, preclinical and firstin-human studies have demonstrated impressive activity of ALK TKI in tumors
harboring ALK rearrangement. In this article, we review current data on molecular
biology of lung cancer and evidence-based patient selection for targeted therapy.

Introduction

PI3K/AKT/mTOR, as seen in Figure 1 [3]. Molecular
aberrations on the EGFR pathway are the most commonly
studied predictive biomarkers of response/ resistance to
targeted agents in lung cancer. This review delineates
the current role of EGFR inhibitors in the treatment
of advanced NSCLC according to EGFR and KRAS
status of the tumor, strategies to overcome resistance to
agents targeting EGFR and also discusses other recently
discovered molecular aberration in lung cancer, ALK
rearrangement, which is being efficiently targeted with
ALK inhibitors.

Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of cancerrelated death worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers [1]. Only
a minority of NSCLC patients is suitable for radical
treatment as curative care. Most patients have advanced
disease at diagnosis and palliative therapy is the mainstay
of management. Conventional chemotherapy of NSCLC
has apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness in
improving survival of lung cancer patients, and treatment
outcomes must still be considered disappointing [2].
Based on a better understanding of the biology of lung
cancer, targeted therapies are also available to treat
patients with NSCLC. Predictive markers of response to
these agents are undergoing prospective validation and
promising results have been reported.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling pathway is importantly implicated in tumor cell
growth, local invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, protein
translation and cell metabolism. It activates two major
pathways in solid tumors, RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK and

response
NSCLC is associated with EGFR overexpression in
up to 80% of the patients and a high EGFR gene copy
number is found in nearly 60% of the cases [4-6]. Mutation
of the EGFR proto-oncogene is found in 10% to 20% of

and 21 and response to gefitinib, treatment of NSCLC has
changed dramatically [7, 8]. It has been shown that exon
19 deletions are more sensitive to erlotinib inhibition than
the L858R mutation, a finding demonstrated by kinetic
analysis [15] and also confirmed in clinical studies [1618]. On the other hand, cetuximab is not as potent as
EGFR TKIs in tumors with exon 19 deletion or L858R
EGFR mutations [19].
Differences in the design of the clinical studies and
technical approaches have led to some confusion about
the role of molecular diagnostics in guiding the use of
EGFR-targeted therapy in NSCLC. Most information
regarding clinical benefit with these agents comes from
retrospective analysis of large studies. At the present time,
prospective clinical data confirming the predictive value of
receptor mutations for response to EGFR TKIs is available
[20, 21]. Apart from mutation analysis, EGFR protein
expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and EGFR gene copy number determined by fluorescent
in situ hybridization (FISH) have been evaluated as
markers for clinical decision making regarding EGFR
TKI therapy. Technical considerations are important in
assessing IHC, which suffers from the lack of a standard
methodology and inconsistencies among testing centers
[6]. In addition, gene copy number evaluation by FISH

lung carcinomas (mostly adenocarcinomas) and nearly
90% of lung cancer-specific EGFR mutations comprise a
leucine-to-arginine substitution at position 858 (L858R)
and deletion mutations in exon 19 (delE746-A750) [710]. These mutations cause constitutive activation of
the tyrosine kinase of the EGFR [11]. DNA sequencing
is the most accurate method for identification of EGFR
mutations in tissue samples. Using polymerase-chain
reaction (PCR) amplification, deletions in exon 19 and
exon 21 point mutations in codon 858 can be detected
by length analysis and specific probes for wild-type and
mutant sequences [12]. In addition, the Scorpion Amplified
Refractory Mutation System (SARMS) technology can be
used to detect EGFR mutations in serum genomic DNA or
circulating lung-cancer cells [13, 14].
The EGFR kinase domain can be targeted with
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib
and gefitinib. In addition, another strategy to inhibit
EGFR activity is with monoclonal antibodies such as
cetuximab, a human-mouse chimeric IgG1 agent. It has
been demonstrated that a subgroup of NSCLC patients
achieves impressive response rates (RR), symptomatic
improvement and long-term progression-free survival
(PFS) with these agents. Since the first reports of an
association between somatic mutations in EGFR exons 19

demonstrated that patients with and EGFR mutation
had an improved RR to gefitinib compared to wild-type
patients (46% versus 10%), as shown in Table 1 [27].
The early trials that evaluated EGFR TKIs for the
second- and third-line settings of advanced NSCLC did
not select patients on the basis of any EGFR marker [28,
29]. The ISEL trial evaluated the role of second-line
gefitinib 250 mg/day in 1,692 patients with advanced
NSCLC [29]. Median overall survival (OS) was 5.6
months, compared to 5.1 months in the placebo group,
difference not statistically significant. High EGFR gene
copy number (30.8% of patients) was associated with a
nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with gefitinib
treatment and patients with EGFR mutations had higher
RR than patients without (37.5% versus 2.6%) [30]. In the
INTEREST trial, 1,466 pretreated patients with advanced
NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib or
docetaxel in the second-line setting [31]. Non-inferiority
of gefitinib compared to docetaxel was confirmed for OS
(7.6 versus 8.0 months). EGFR mutation-positive patients
had significantly longer PFS (HR – Hazard Ratio = 0.16)
and higher objective RR (42.1% versus 21.1%) with
gefitinib compared to docetaxel. Patients with high EGFR
copy number also had higher RR with gefitinib (13%
versus 7.4%) [32].

may be affected by tumor heterogeneity within analyzed
specimens. Therefore, a detailed review of the clinical
trials evaluating molecular markers of response to antiEGFR agents is warranted.

Review of clinical trials with
anti-EGFR agents in NSCLC
Gefitinib and Erlotinib
Phase I studies of gefitinib defined dose-limiting
toxicities at 700 to 1000 mg/day [22, 23]. However,
pharmacodynamic data showed that a dose of 150 mg/
day was sufficient to suppress EGFR signaling in skin
biopsy specimens [24]. As chronic daily doses higher than
500 mg/day were relatively not well tolerated, further
studies evaluated 250 and 500 mg/day doses. Gefitinib
was examined as monotherapy in two phase II studies
called IDEAL trials [25, 26]. Response rates with doses
of 250 and 500 mg/day were similar, ranging from 10% to
18%. Notably, responses were more likely in patients with
specific characteristics: Asians, females, non-smoking
and those with adenocarcinoma tumors. Posterior analysis

mutation was confirmed, with longer overall survival in
patients with EGFR mutation tumors compared to wildtype tumors in both treatment arms [41].
A similar trial was carried out in the USA in 676
nonselected patients with advanced NSCLC (BMS099)
[42]. There was no survival benefit with the addition
of cetuximab to paclitaxel-carboplatin combination
chemotherapy. Tissue samples for biomarker subanalysis
were available for one-third of the patients. EGFR
expression, EGFR copy number and EGFR mutations
were not associated with treatment outcomes [42].

In contrast to gefitinib, dose of erlotinib studied
in phase II and III trials is the maximum-tolerated dose
defined in phase I trials (150 mg/ day) [33]. A phase II
trial in patients with refractory NSCLC confirmed RR
of approximately 12% and survival outcomes similar
to gefitinib [34]. The BR.21 study (erlotinib in secondand third-line settings of advanced NSCLC) found
superiority in survival with erlotinib group as compared
to placebo (median OS of 6.7 versus 4.7 months) [28].
Molecular analysis of BR.21 trial showed that FISH
positivity (45% of tumors) was predictive of improved
survival with erlotinib (HR = 0.44) [35]. EGFR mutations
were confirmed in 17% of tumors (34 patients had
classical EGFR activating mutations). Response rate was
significantly higher in patients with these mutations (27%
versus 7%) compared to patients with wild-type or other
indeterminate mutations [36]. This trial also confirmed
symptomatic and survival benefit of erlotinib in patients
without initial clinical predictors of response to EGFR
TKIs [37]. One possible explanation to this finding is
that erlotinib was administered at its maximum-tolerated
dose, which could have different effects in the population
of patients with wild-type EGFR, not hypersensitive to
EGFR TKIs. This correlates with the higher prevalence of
rash, a known marker of efficacy with these agents, in the
erlotinib trial (76%, as compared to 37% in the gefitinib
trial) [38].
Another study with relevant molecular data is the
SATURN trial, which randomly assigned 889 patients with
advanced NSCLC who had response or stable disease after
four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy to erlotinib
or placebo as maintenance treatment [39]. Progressionfree survival was significantly improved in the erlotinib
maintenance arm (HR = 0.71). Tumor biomarker analysis
of EGFR mutation status was available for 437 patients:
those with EGFR mutation had median PFS of 44.6 weeks
on erlotinib compared to 13 weeks with placebo (HR =
0.1), a remarkable benefit for this subgroup of patients.
EGFR mutation was the only marker significantly
predictive of differential erlotinib effect [39].

Prospective
studies
with
EGFR-TKIs in selected patient
populations
Studies with first-line EGFR TKIs in advanced lung
cancer have been recently reported. The first study was
conducted in Asian patients and examined EGFR status in
75 patients [43]. Sixteen patients with EGFR mutation were
enrolled onto the study and received gefitinib 250 mg/day.
Overall RR was 75% and median PFS was 9.7 months.
As seen in Table 1, a confirmatory trial with gefitinib as
first-line treatment of advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC
reported RR of 53% in 45 patients [18]. Interesting data
came from another prospective trial in Japan that enrolled
30 patients with EGFR mutations and poor Performance
Status (PS) without indication for palliative chemotherapy
[44]. The overall RR was 66% and the disease control rate
was 90%. Of note, 15 of 22 patients with baseline PS 3
improved to PS 1. Median PFS and OS were 6.5 months
and 17.8 months, respectively [44].
Prospective screening studies in non-Asian
populations have also been reported. The first study
screened chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced
NSCLC and clinical characteristic associated with EGFR
mutations [45]. Response rate was 55% in 31 patients who
received gefitinib and the median PFS was 9.2 months.
The authors also evaluated EGFR gene copy number by
FISH and concluded that it did not provide additional
predictive information. This was because most patients
who harbor EGFR mutations also had high gene copy
numbers [46]. The Spanish Lung Cancer Group trial
observed a prevalence of EGFR mutations in patients
with lung cancer in Spain around 16% (350 of 2,105
cases) [16]. In 60% of the patients, EGFR mutations were
also detected in the serum. Median PFS and OS for 217
patients who received erlotinib were 14 months and 27
months, respectively, and radiologic RR was around 70%.
Duration of response was similar for patients receiving
first-line therapy (14 months) or second-line therapy (13
months) [16].
Recently, results of the phase II randomized trial
of erlotinib compared to erlotinib in combination with
paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy in treatmentnaïve, never or light former smokers with advanced lung

Cetuximab
In the FLEX trial, 1,125 patients with advanced
NSCLC and EGFR-positive tumors by IHC were
randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus cetuximab or
chemotherapy alone [40]. Patients given chemotherapy
plus cetuximab survived longer than those in the
chemotherapy-alone group (median OS of 11.3 versus
10.1 months; HR for death 0.87, p = 0.044). Molecular
biomarker study showed that no significant differences
in survival were detected between patients with FISH
positive or negative tumors in either treatment arm [41].
As anticipated by preclinical data, EGFR mutation status
(positive in 17% of cases) was not predictive of benefit
with cetuximab. However, the prognostic value of

adenocarcinoma [47]. Of the 182 patients randomized, 67
(39%) had mutant and 105 (61%) wild-type EGFR. In
the overall patient population, addition of chemotherapy
did not significantly increase response rate or PFS. EGFR
mutant patients had median PFS of 15.7 months with
single-agent erlotinib as compared to 17.2 months with
combination therapy. On the other hand, PFS in patients
with tumors harboring wild-type EGFR was only 2.4
months with single-agent erlotinib and 4.8 months with
the addition of chemotherapy [47].
Based on these findings, several phase III trials are
comparing first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with
chemotherapy or EGFR TKI in specific populations of
patients: (a) in a clinically-enriched subgroup; or (b) in
a biomarker-selected subgroup - those with documented
EGFR exon 19 or 21 mutations. The first published
trial, named IPASS, selected more than 1,200 patients
to receive gefitinib 250 mg/day or standard paclitaxelcarboplatin chemotherapy [17]. Only patients with clinical
characteristics predictive of response to EGFR TKIs
were enrolled (adenocarcinoma histology; nonsmokers,
defined as patients who had smoked <100 cigarettes in
their lifetime; or former light smokers, defined as those
who had stopped smoking at least 15 years previously
and had a total of ≤10 pack-years of smoking). The study
met its primary objective of showing the noninferiority of
gefitinib and also showed its superiority, as compared to
chemotherapy, with regards to PFS (HR for progression

or death = 0.74). The 12-months rates of PFS were 24.9%
with gefitinib and 6.7% with paclitaxel-carboplatin.
However, the overall population result is clearly of less
relevance than the outcome in subgroups of patients. As
shown in Table 2, in the 261 patients who were positive
for the EGFR mutation, PFS was significantly longer
among those who received gefitinib than among those
who received paclitaxel-carboplatin (HR = 0.48), whereas
in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the
mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who
received chemotherapy (HR for progression or death with
gefitinib = 2.85). In the mutation-negative population,
objective RR was only 1.1% with gefitinib versus 23.5%
with chemotherapy. High EGFR copy number by FISH
was predictive for efficacy only when accompanied by the
presence of concomitant EGFR mutation. Patients with
a high EGFR copy number and wild-type EGFR did not
benefit from gefitinib, but did benefit from chemotherapy
[17]. No difference in OS was seen in patients with EGFR
mutation regardless of the treatment assigned [48]. The
major reason for the lack of survival benefit is the crossover effect, as half of the patients in the chemotherapy
arm received EGFR TKIs at disease progression [48]. The
second trial assigned 309 chemotherapy-naïve patients
with adenocarcinomas who had never smoked to receive
250 mg gefitinib daily or gemcitabine plus cisplatin at
standard doses [49]. Progression-free survival was similar
in both arms (6.1 months for gefitinib, 6.6 months for

chemotherapy) and in the subgroup of patients with known
EGFR mutations (44%), gefitinib produced a higher RR,
as shown in Table 2 [49]. Both studies emphasize the
importance of molecular selection of patients for first-line
treatment with an EGFR TKI.
Preliminary results of other phase III trials that
randomized patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR
mutations at baseline to receive EGFR TKIs or standard
first-line platinum-based regimens are presented in Table
2. The North-East Japan trial (prematurely interrupted after
interim analysis) and the WJTOG3405 trial demonstrated
that treatment with gefitinib doubles the RR and
significantly improves PFS as compared to chemotherapy
[20, 21]. The first study with erlotinib as comparator was
recently presented. In the OPTIMAL trial, Asian patients
with chemonaïve NSCLC with EGFR mutations were
randomized to erlotinib 150 mg/day or gemcitabine plus
carboplatin [50]. Both RR and PFS were higher in the
EGFR TKI subgroup [50]. Additional prospective studies
are underway, as seen in Table 2.

no previous EGFR TKI therapy received BIBW2992 as
single agent [59]. Overall RR was 60%, with a promising
PFS of 14 months. This drug has also shown activity in
patients whose tumors harbored less common EGFR
mutations [60]. Its efficacy was also evaluated as a
rescue treatment after failure to erlotinib or gefitinib in a
randomized phase III trial [61]. At primary analysis (358
events in 585 patients), median OS was 10.8 months in the
BIBW2992 group and 11.9 months in the placebo group. A
significant PFS increase was seen in patients that received
the study drug (3.3 versus 1.1 months) [61]. Regarding
the PF00029804 compound, preliminary data from a
phase II randomized trial showed that PFS was superior
when compared to erlotinib in the general population
of patients with chemotherapy-refractory NSCLC, not
selected according to EGFR mutation status (12.4 weeks
versus 8.3 weeks) [62]. As first-line treatment of patients
with known EGFR mutation or clinically selected (Asians
with adenocarcinoma and non-or light smoking history),
PF00029804 showed encouraging efficacy, with 6 monthPFS rate of 67% (85% in those with EGFR mutation) [63].
Activation of downstream signaling via alternative
mechanisms that stimulate the RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is another mechanism of
resistance to EGFR TKIs. This occurs with activation of the
IGF-1R pathway (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor)
[64], amplification/ mutations of MET (the receptor for
hepatocyte growth factor receptor, identified in 10-20% of
NSCLC) [65-67], and PIK3CA amplification/ mutations
(identified in up to 17% of NSCLC) [68]. In this situation,
there appears to be dual input to signaling and combined
inhibition of EGFR and the alternative pathway may be
necessary to kill tumor cells. A combination approach
may prevent the emergence of resistance that eventually
occurs following initial response to EGFR TKIs and may
increase the proportion of EGFR wild-type patients that
respond. Preliminary data of a phase II randomized trial
of erlotinib and placebo or in combination with a nonATP competitive receptor TKI of c-MET (ARQ 197) were
recently presented [69]. Progression-free survival was
significantly higher for the dual inhibition approach (HR
= 0.68, p < 0.05) [69]. A monoclonal antibody targeting
MET (MetMab) is also under clinical development. In
patients with advanced NSCLC and MET expression by
IHC analysis, the combination of erlotinib and MetMab
significantly increased PFS (HR = 0.56, p = 0.05) as
compared to erlotinib and placebo in a phase II randomized
trial [70]. Multiple phase I and II trials are underway to
evaluate the additive benefit of other targeted agents, such
as anti-IGF1R monoclonal antibodies, PI3K/mTOR and
MEK inhibitiors.

Overcoming resistance to EGFR
TKIs
Tumors become resistant when they reactivate
downstream signaling despite the presence of the EGFR
inhibitor. Zhang et al. summarize the current understanding
of the functional role of activating EGFR mutations in
addition to the pivotal primary and acquired resistance
mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors [51]. Resistance is
typically caused by mutations in the EGFR gene that
are not associated with sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, such
as insertion mutations in exon 20 [52], or by other
somatic mutations in genes that have an impact on the
EGFR signaling pathway, such as KRAS [53]. Acquired
resistance may be caused by additional mutations in the
EGFR gene obtained during the course of treatment that
change the protein-coding sequence or by amplification of
another oncogene signaling pathway [54].
The most commonly identified mechanism of
resistance is an EGFR mutation at position 790 (T790M),
resulting in substitution of a threonine residue with
methionine, which abrogates the ability of gefitinib or
erlotinib to inhibit EGFR [55, 56]. This mutation can
be found in 50% of the tissue samples from patients
with acquired gefitinib resistance [57]. Another acquired
mutation in EGFR, which leads to substitution of alanine
for threonine at position 854 (T854A) and hinders the
inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation by erlotinib, has also
been reported [58]. Various irreversible EGFR inhibitors,
such as BIBW2992/ afatinib (targeting EGFR and HER2)
and PF00299804 (targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER4)
are undergoing clinical development. These agents may
prevent and overcome primary and acquired resistance to
first-generation reversible EGFR TKIs. In the LUX-Lung
2 study, 129 patients with activating EGFR mutations and

KRAS status and response to antiEGFR agents
KRAS mutations were identified in NSCLC tumors
170

more than 20 years ago [71]. KRAS encodes a GTPase
downstream of EGFR and mutations (most frequent
in exons 12, 13 and 61) lead to stimulus-independent,
persistent activation of downstream effectors of the RAF/
MAPK/MEK/ERK cascade [72]. They are associated
with significant tobacco exposure and worse prognosis,
although contradictory data have been reported [73, 74].
Prevalence of mutation is about 20% in the overall lung
cancer patient population, 5% to 15% in never-smokers
patients with adenocarcinoma and approximately 5% in
the squamous cell carcinoma subtype [75-77].
KRAS mutations are associated with primary
resistance to EGFR TKIs [78]. Phase II trials have shown
very small or absent response rates to erlotinib in patients
with KRAS mutations [79]. A recent meta-analysis
demonstrated 3% rate of objective tumor response
to EGFR TKIs in patients with KRAS mutations, as
compared to 26% in those with wild-type KRAS [80].
Data from the TRIBUTE trial (chemotherapy with or
without erlotinib for previously untreated patients with
NSCLC) suggest that, in KRAS mutated patients, OS and
RR may be worse with the addition of EGFR TKI [81].
KRAS mutant patients (20% of available tumor samples)
showed a RR of 8% with paclitaxel-carboplatin plus
erlotinib, compared with 23% for patients that received
the chemotherapy doublet alone. Of note, the RR for
patients treated with chemotherapy alone did not differ
significantly by KRAS mutation status (26% in those
without mutation versus 23%) [81]. In the INTEREST
trial, KRAS mutation was not a predictive factor for a
differential survival effect between gefitinib and docetaxel
[32]. In the BR.21 trial, significant survival benefit from
second- or third-line erlotinib therapy was observed for
patients with wild-type KRAS (HR = 0.69, p=0.03) but
not for patients with mutant KRAS (HR = 1.67, p = 0.31)
[36]. Molecular data from the maintenance SATURN trial
suggested that KRAS mutation was a negative prognostic
factor for patients receiving placebo, with significantly
shorter PFS (HR = 1.5, p = 0.017) [39]. Patients with
wild-type KRAS had statistically significant benefit with
erlotinib in terms of PFS (HR = 0.7, p = 0.0009). The
hazard ratio for PFS was similar in the KRAS mutant
population, but the benefit was not statistically significant
(HR = 0.77, p = 0.22) [39].
Based on data from KRAS mutation status and
benefit of cetuximab in advanced colon cancer, molecular
analysis of FLEX trial was conducted. Of the 1,125
patients enrolled, 395 had tumor samples available and
KRAS mutation was detected in 19%. The comparison
of the cetuximab treatment effects in patients with KRAS
wild-type tumors and those with KRAS mutant tumors
showed no marked differences with regard to PFS or OS
[41]. In this trial, the benefit of cetuximab was observed

and

A fusion gene between echinoderm microtubuleassociated protein like 4 (EML4) and the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) has recently been identified in
NSCLC [82]. Although more frequent in hematological
malignancies, recurrent chromosome translocations may
play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of solid tumors.
The fusion gene EML4-ALK, inv(2)(p21p23), becomes
activated to exert a marked oncogenicity both in vitro and
in vivo, possibly by switching on the RAS/RAF signaling
pathway [83]. ALK rearrangement can be identified by
FISH analysis using break-apart probes to ALK, which
detects disruption of the ALK locus but does not confirm
EML4 as the partner fusion gene. Recently, a novel highly
sensitive antibody allowed for the routine detection of
ALK-rearranged lung carcinomas by standard IHC [84].
Among 266 resected NSCLCs in an East Asian
population, the EML4-ALK fusion gene was found in
about 5% of cases, as assessed by reverse transcriptasePCR and posterior sequencing [85]. EML4-ALK was
associated with younger age of cancer onset and with
never-smoking status. EML4-ALK, EGFR, and KRAS
mutations were all mutually exclusive, suggesting that
ALK mutation may be an important oncogenic factor,
and a potential therapeutic target in EGFR wild-type and
KRAS wild-type lung cancer. When patients are selected
for genetic screening on the basis of two or more of
clinical characteristics (female sex, Asian ethnicity, never/
light smoking history, and adenocarcinoma histology),
a recent study demonstrated that among 141 tumors
evaluated, 19 (13%) were EML4-ALK mutant and 31
(22%) were EGFR mutant [86]. Considering only never/
light smokers without EGFR mutation, the frequency of
EML4-ALK was 33%. EML4-ALK positivity was related
with resistance to EGFR TKIs but similar RR to platinumbased combination chemotherapy. In addition, presence of
EML4-ALK mutation was not associated differences in
OS, as compared to those patients with wild type EML4ALK and EGFR [86].
Impressive clinical activity was demonstrated in
a phase I trial of an oral ATP- competitive TKI of ALK
and c-MET, crizotinib (PF-02341066), in patients with
advanced NSCLC and whose tumors harbored ALK
rearrangement by FISH analysis [87]. Patients enrolled
shared several key clinical features with EGFR-mutated
patients (adenocarcinoma histology and nonsmoking
history). Among 82 patients treated in an expanded cohort
of the dose-escalation study (250 mg twice daily), 57%
had an objective RR and 72% were progression-free at
6 months [87]. All patients tested negative for EGFR
mutation and amplification of MET, another target for
crizotinib, which suggested that the therapeutic effect is

unfit or who do not agree with chemotherapy; and (b)
as maintenance/ “early second-line” therapy for patients
that received previous chemotherapy. Erlotinib may be
considered a salvage treatment in unselected patient
populations of chemotherapy-refractory NSCLC, as
disease stabilization and symptomatic improvement was
observed independent of molecular or clinical predictors
of benefit. In addition, more clinical and translational data
on irreversible EGFR inhibitors and dual targeted therapy
in molecularly-selected subgroups of patients will help
oncologists to personalize therapy of advanced NSCLC
even further.

Conclusions
Identifying the patients who are most likely to obtain
clinical benefit from targeted therapies in NSCLC is of
paramount importance. To make rational clinical decisions,
in addition to understanding the biology of the disease,
oncologists need to rely on standardized and validated
methods of molecular assessment. EGFR amplification
by FISH and protein expression measured by IHC are not
informative for personalized therapy in advanced NSCLC
but further analysis of studies that combine chemotherapy
with monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR is indicated.
In addition, the value of determining KRAS mutation
status to select EGFR TKI therapy is not clear. On
the other hand, it is now well established that specific
genetic lesions that drive the proliferation of cancer
cells render some tumors very sensitive to therapeutic
inhibitors targeting the mutated pathway. The most useful
biomarker is EGFR mutation status and its determination
is mandatory for proper therapeutic decisions. It is a
good prognostic factor and has also predictive value for
selecting treatment with EGFR TKIs. Different from
the initially unsuccessful trials of EGFR inhibitors in
nongenotyped patients, data from multiple phase III trials
show superiority of gefitinib/ erlotinib over standard
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC in terms of RR and
PFS in the biomarker-selected EGFR mutation positive
subgroup of patients. Additionally, ALK rearrangement is
a promising biomarker of benefit with ALK inhibitors and
its detection resulted in prompt translation of preclinical
data to patient care. Only 3 years after the initiation of the
phase I trial, a phase III registration study of crizotinib in
ALK-positive patients started enrollment. Participation in
a clinical trial is the best alternative for this subgroup of
patients. Importantly, although EGFR and ALK mutations
are found mostly in patients with history of no smoking
or light smoking who have adenocarcinoma, genotyping
should be offered to all patients with advanced NSCLC if
treatment with specific TKIs is available.
In conclusion, EGFR TKI therapy should be
recommended to patients with activating EGFR mutations
in the course of the disease. However, the lack of OS
advantage with early treatment raises the question of
whether we should give these drugs up-front, as maintenance
therapy or as second-/ third-line options. Clinical practice
in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients has shown
that progression and symptomatic deterioration can occur
very short after treatment discontinuation. EGFR TKI
therapy may be started once the mutation status is known:
