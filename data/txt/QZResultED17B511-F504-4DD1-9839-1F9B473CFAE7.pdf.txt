Discovery of Mesothelin and Exploiting It as a Target for
Immunotherapy
Ira Pastan and Rafﬁt Hassan

Abstract
We have recently reported that an immunotoxin targeting mesothelin produced durable major tumor
regressions in patients with extensive treatment-refractory mesothelioma. These unprecedented tumor
responses have prompted us to review how mesothelin was discovered and the advances that led to these
tumor responses. This review is not comprehensive but focuses on major developments over the past 20 years
since mesothelin was ﬁrst identiﬁed in our laboratory. Mesothelin is a cell-surface glycoprotein whose expression
in normal human tissues is restricted to mesothelial cells. Because it is highly expressed by many solid tumors, it is
an attractive immunotherapy target. Antibody-based therapies currently in clinical trials include an immunotoxin, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, and an antibody drug conjugate. In addition, a mesothelin tumor vaccine
and a mesothelin- chimeric antigen receptor are being evaluated in the clinic. SS1P, an anti-mesothelin
immunotoxin, was the ﬁrst mesothelin-directed therapy to enter the clinic, and its use showed that mesothelin-targeted therapy was safe in patients. More importantly, our recent work has shown that SS1P in combination
with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide can result in durable tumor regression in patients with advanced
mesothelioma and opens up the possibility that such an approach can beneﬁt patients with many common
cancers. Cancer Res; 74(11); 2907–12. 2014 AACR.

Discovery of Mesothelin
In the early 1990s, Ira Pastan and Mark Willingham (National Cancer Institute, NIH), realizing there were very few targets
on the plasma membrane of solid tumors that were useful for
antibody-based therapies, initiated a search for new antibodies
that recognized cell-surface proteins highly expressed on
cancers and not expressed on essential normal tissues so that
undesirable side effects would not occur when antibodies were
given to these patients. To make new monoclonal antibodies
(mAb), they used standard hybridoma methodology, but to
prevent mice from making antibodies to normal tissue antigens, they added a step in which mice were tolerized to normal
human proteins by ﬁrst immunizing them with normal liver
or kidney membranes and then treating with cyclophosphamide to kill the B cells activated by this immunization. In the
experiment that led to the discovery of mesothelin, they
were looking for a new antibody to ovarian cancer and thus
the mice were immunized with an ovarian cancer cell line
(OVCAR3). After isolation of candidate mAbs, they used
immunohistochemistry on frozen sections of normal tissues
to exclude mAbs reacting with essential organs.

In 1992, these investigators reported on an antibody reacting
with ovarian cancers named mAb K1 (1). Immunohistochemical studies performed on normal human and monkey tissues
showed that the reactivity of mAb K1 was limited to the
mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium,
as well as cells of the fallopian tubes and tonsils (1). The mAb
was subsequently shown to react with malignant mesotheliomas, as well as squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus and
cervix (2, 3). The antibody was given the name K1, to acknowledge the contribution of Kai Chang (National Cancer Institute,
NIH), the postdoctoral fellow who worked on the project.
The K1 antibody has low afﬁnity; it reacts with frozen tissues
but not as well with formalin-ﬁxed tissues, presumably because
the epitope it recognizes is destroyed by ﬁxation. Subsequent
studies using an antibody made to a peptide that reacts with
ﬁxed tissues showed that mesothelin was also present in
cancers of the pancreas, lung, stomach, bile ducts, and triple-negative breast cancer (4–7). It was estimated that
mesothelin is expressed in 30% of human cancers and is
therefore a very important target for immunotherapy (8).

To identify the protein reacting with mAb K1, proteins on
the cell surface were labeled with 125I and the cells were treated
with phospholipase C to release surface proteins. The proteins
released were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western
blotting. The antibody recognized a protein with a molecular
weight of 40 kDa on both OVCAR3 and Hela cells. The K1 mAb
was then used to screen a lambda cDNA expression library
made from Hela cells. The cDNA that was isolated encoded a

the action of the protease furin (Fig. 1A). MPF was initially

69-kDa protein, much larger than the 40-kDa protein detected
on the surface of cells (9). When the cDNA was expressed in 3T3
cells, a major 40-kDa band and a minor 69-kDa band were
detected indicating that the 40-kDa band was derived from a
larger protein. Furthermore, analysis of the DNA sequence
showed that the C terminus of the protein was characteristic of
proteins, which are attached to the plasma membrane by
phosphatidyl inositol. Because the protein was expressed in
normal mesothelial cells, we named the gene and the protein it
encoded as mesothelin.
Cell-surface mesothelin is almost exclusively of the 40-kDaglycosylated form. The amino terminal peptide named MPF
(megakaryocyte potentiating factor) is released from cells by

uptake of the labeled antibody was demonstrated (11). To
determine whether the antibody could be used to kill tumor
cells, a fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) was attached
to the antibody and the resulting immunotoxin (K1LysPE38QQR) was shown to kill mesothelin-expressing cell
lines and to cause regressions of a mesothelin-expressing tumor
in mice (12). These two experiments, as well as the frequent
distribution of mesothelin on cancers and the limited expression on normal tissues, provided key evidence that mesothelin is
an excellent target for antibody-based therapies and encouraged the development of agents that could be used in patients.
Because the K1 antibody has a low afﬁnity for mesothelin, a
new antibody termed SS was produced by immunizing mice
using a mesothelin-expressing cDNA construct. The technique
of phage display was used to isolate an Fv that bound to
mesothelin (13). The afﬁnity of SS was low, but was improved to
a Kd of about 1 nmol/L by mutagenizing residues in the CDR3
of the heavy chain of the Fv using a new technique called hot
spot mutagenesis (14). The new Fv (SS1) was used to make a
recombinant immunotoxin, termed SS1P, by fusing the Fv to a
38-kDa fragment of PE. Recombinant immunotoxins are chimeric proteins in which a tumor-speciﬁc Fv is attached to a
portion of PE or other protein toxins (15). SS1P kills cells by
binding to mesothelin, entering cells by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, inactivating elongation factor 2, arresting protein
synthesis, and inducing apoptosis.

Blood Test for Mesothelin
In 1999, Scholler and colleagues reported the development of
a blood ELISA test that measured "soluble member(s) of the
mesothelin/megakaryocyte potentiating factor family" in sera
from patients with ovarian carcinoma (16). They named this
material SMRP (soluble mesothelin-related peptide) and suggested that it differed from mesothelin. Our group had also
been developing a test to measure mesothelin levels in the
blood using two new antibodies to mesothelin (MN and MB),
and we thought it very likely that SMRP was actually shed
mesothelin (17). To demonstrate the nature of the protein shed
from cells, we isolated the protein and determined its amino
acid sequence. These studies showed that the shed protein is
identical to mesothelin and established that SMRP is actually
shed mesothelin (18).
Mesothelin levels are elevated in about 50% of patients with
mesothelioma and ovarian cancer (17, 19). Unexpectedly,
mesothelin levels are not elevated in patients with pancreatic
cancer despite the fact that the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas highly express mesothelin on the cell surface (20).
It is also not clear why mesothelin levels are not elevated in
more patients with mesothelioma because the protein is highly
expressed in almost all patients with epithelial-type mesothelioma. Possible reasons for the lack of detection of mesothelin
in the blood are poor shedding, destruction in the cancer
before entry into the blood, barriers to entry into the blood,
and small-volume disease. Several ELISAs have also been
developed to measure the levels of MPF in human serum
(21). MPF levels, like mesothelin levels, are elevated in many
patients with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer but are not
elevated in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (20).

www.aacrjournals.org

Although mesothelin is attached to the cell membrane
through its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and
phospholipase C can release the protein from the cell, it seems
that phospholipase C does not play a signiﬁcant role in the
physiologic shedding process. Mesothelin shedding is mediated by the sheddase TNF-a converting enzyme, which is a
member of the matrix metalloproteinase/a disintegrin and
metalloprotease family (22).

Mesothelin Function
Although many studies have been carried out on the possible
function of mesothelin, its role in cancer is still unclear and may
be cancer type speciﬁc. Mice in which the mesothelin gene had
been inactivated appeared perfectly normal. They bred normally, had normal blood counts, and grew to normal size (23).
It was shown that cells expressing CA125 bind to cells
expressing mesothelin (24). Furthermore the anti-mesothelin
antibody, MORAb-009, prevents this binding (25). On the basis
of these studies, it was suggested that mesothelin has a role in
the spread of ovarian cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity and
mesothelioma in the pleural and peritoneal cavity. However, no
direct evidence in support of this hypothesis was published,
although an interaction of mesothelin and CA125 must occur
in patients, because patients treated with the mesothelinbinding antibody MORAb-009 had an elevation in serum levels
of CA125 (26).
A variety of studies have been done to evaluate the function
of mesothelin. In Eker rats, the development of tuberous
sclerosis-2–induced renal carcinoma was signiﬁcantly reduced
in the absence of a homologue of the MSLN gene (27). In
pancreatic cancer cells, overexpression of MLSN was implicated in signiﬁcant enhancement of tumor cell growth and
migration in vitro, but the molecular mechanism that contributes to these phenotypes is not well understood (28). On
the other hand, human mesothelioma cells frequently lose
mesothelin expression when placed in culture, indicating that
mesothelin is not needed for growth of mesothelioma cells,
although it may contribute to the aggressive behavior of some
types of cancer in animals (29). Recently it was shown that in
patients with early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, overexpression of mesothelin is associated with decreased overall survival
(30). However, the precise role of mesothelin in carcinogenesis
is unclear and is an active area of investigation.

Clinical Trials
Because of the high expression of mesothelin in many
malignancies (Fig. 1B), a variety of agents are being developed
to target mesothelin. Results of several ongoing clinical trials of
immunotherapy agents directed against mesothelin have
shown that targeting mesothelin is safe and does not result in
toxicity to essential normal tissues. Both antibody-based therapies, as well as mesothelin vaccines, are being investigated.
Immunotoxins
The ﬁrst mesothelin-directed agent to enter the clinic was
the immunotoxin SS1P (Fig. 1C). Because the SS1P contains a
bacterial protein, the goals of the phase I trials were to

determine its safety proﬁle, to determine a maximum tolerated
dose (MTD), and to assess how many doses could be given
before antibodies formed and inactivated the toxin. In one trial,
SS1P was given as a bolus infusion over 30 minutes and the
dose-limiting toxicity was pleuritis. A second cycle of SS1P
could only be given to 10% of patients due to neutralizing
antibody formation (31). In another trial, SS1P was given as a
continuous infusion for 10 days. Dose-limiting side effects were
very similar to those from the bolus infusion trial (32). In
neither trial were major responses observed, although there
was shrinkage of small-volume disease in some patients.
One factor limiting the activity of large-molecular-weight
molecules like immunotoxins and antibody drug conjugates
(ADC) is penetration into solid tumors. To overcome this
limitation, we performed a clinical trial in which we combined
SS1P with chemotherapy. We had shown in mouse studies that
chemotherapy, by disrupting tumor cell packing and lowering
intratumoral ﬂuid pressure, allowed immunotoxin to reach
more cells within the tumor and produced better antitumor
responses (33). In the trial, SS1P was combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy-na€ve
patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma. Results of
this clinical trial showed that SS1P can be safely combined with
pemetrexed and cisplatin and both chemotherapy and SS1P
could be administered at their MTDs without overlapping
toxicity. Out of the 13 patients treated at the MTD, 10 patients
had objective partial responses. Although this was a small trial,
the objective response rate of 77% was signiﬁcantly better than
the 41% response rate seen in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (34). However, as seen in the phase I clinical trials
of SS1P alone, 90% of patients developed neutralizing antibodies to SS1P after only one cycle of SS1P and limited
retreatment.
Development of human antibody response to immunotoxins
in patients with solid tumors is a signiﬁcant impediment to
their clinical development, and previous efforts to limit their
immunogenicity by treatment with single agents such as
steroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or rituximab have
not been successful (35–37). However, we have recently shown
that a regimen of two agents, pentostatin and cyclophosphamide, to deplete T and B cells, completely abrogated the
development of anti-SS1P antibodies in immune-competent
Balb/C mice, which were immunized with SS1P (38).
This strategy of using pentostatin and cyclophosphamide to
prevent human antibody response to SS1P was evaluated in a
pilot study of heavily pretreated chemotherapy-refractory
mesothelioma patients. Eleven patients were enrolled in the
study and received pentostatin and cyclophosphamide before
SS1P administration. This regimen was well tolerated, and no
patient developed opportunistic infections. As predicted, this
regimen decreased the development of human antibodies to
SS1P; only two of ten patients developed antibodies after one
cycle of therapy, which was signiﬁcantly better than that in
prior clinical trials where about 90% of patients developed
antibodies after one cycle of therapy (39). Unexpectedly, we
observed remarkable antitumor activity in these treatmentrefractory patients who had poor prognosis (Fig. 1D). Three of
the ten evaluable patients with extensive tumor burden had

2910

Cancer Res; 74(11) June 1, 2014

durable partial responses, and two of these patients had
complete metabolic responses by positron emission tomography scan. All three patients were alive after 27, 25, and 22
months of starting therapy. In addition, two patients who did
not initially respond to SS1P had a dramatic antitumor
response when treated with chemotherapy to which they had
not previously responded. We have recently initiated additional clinical studies in which the pentostatin and cyclophosphamide regimen will be evaluated in more patients with mesothelioma, as well as in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Chimeric anti-mesothelin antibody
MORAb-009 (amatuximab) is a chimeric antibody directed
to mesothelin. In preclinical studies, it kills mesothelin-expressing cell lines by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and also inhibits the interaction between mesothelin and
CA-125 (25). In a phase I clinical trial, this antibody was well
tolerated and the MTD was established as 200 mg/m2 (40). A
randomized phase II clinical trial of amatuximab plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with pancreatic
cancer failed to show any advantage to the combination
therapy (41). In a nonrandomized clinical trial of patients with
advanced unresectable pleural mesothelioma, amatuximab
was given in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin.
Although this trial did not achieve its primary objective,
improvement in progression-free survival as compared with
historical controls, it did show improvement in overall survival
with a plateau at the end of the survival curve (42). These data
are encouraging for patients with advanced mesothelioma and
suggest that this regimen should be evaluated in a randomized
clinical trial compared with pemetrexed and cisplatin alone.
Antibody drug conjugates
BAY94–9343 is an ADC in which a humanized immunoglobulin G 1 anti-mesothelin mAb is linked to the maytansine
derivative DM4; it is currently undergoing phase I evaluation in
patients with advanced solid tumors. BAY94-9343 is given as an
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or
unacceptable side effects. Preliminary results of this trial show
an acceptable toxicity proﬁle, and the MTD has not yet been
achieved (43).
Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are engineered to
express the Fv portion of a mAb fused to a T-cell receptor.
Binding of the CAR to the tumor antigen activates T-cell
signaling and results in cell killing. Because early clinical trials
of SS1P showed no off target toxicity, there is a growing interest
in exploiting mesothelin as a target for CAR T-cell therapy.
Currently, two anti-mesothelin CAR T-cell approaches are
being pursued (44, 45). Preliminary results of mesothelinspeciﬁc CAR mRNA-engineered T cells show that this
approach is safe and can induce antitumor responses (46).
Mesothelin tumor vaccines
The only mesothelin tumor vaccine currently in clinical
development is CRS-207, which consists of a live-attenuated
strain of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes expressing

human mesothelin. The safety of this vaccine was established
in a phase I clinical trial of patients with mesothelin-expressing
refractory cancers (47). This vaccine has recently been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial of patients with advanced
pancreatic cancer. These patients were randomized to six
cycles of GVAX (allogeneic pancreatic cancer cell lines secreting granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) vaccine alone or two cycles of GVAX followed by four cycles of
CRS-207 every 3 weeks. A total of 90 patients were enrolled with
61 treated with GVAX/CRS-207 and 29 with GVAX alone. After
a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival
of patients treated with GVAX/CRS-207 was 6.1 months versus
3.9 months for patients treated with GVAX alone (P ¼ 0.011;
ref. 48). Although a small study, these results are impressive in
this study population and need to be validated in a larger phase
III setting. CRS-207 is also in early stages of clinical evaluation
in patients with mesothelioma and is being tested in a ﬁrst-line
setting in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin.

pentostatin and cyclophosphamide can delay antibody formation to SS1P and lead to durable antitumor activity in some
patients. We have also used protein engineering to identify and
remove B- and T-cell epitopes in SS1P to make a less immunogenic immunotoxin (49, 50). On the basis of these studies, we
have recently developed a new immunotoxin in which domain
II of PE was deleted and six residues in domain III mutated to
alanine. Because the deletion of domain II resulted in a protein
that is small and rapidly ﬁltered by the kidney, we collaborated
with Roche Pharmaceuticals to replace the Fv with a Fab to
make RG7787. Preclinical studies with RG7787 have shown that
large doses can be safely given to mice, it has a decreased
capacity to cause capillary leak syndrome in rats, and it has
signiﬁcant antitumor activity in mice bearing several types of
mesothelin-expressing tumors. RG7787 is expected to undergo
phase I clinical evaluation by the end of 2014.
Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest
No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed.

Future Directions
Clinical trials of different agents targeting mesothelin have
conﬁrmed that it is an excellent target for cancer immunotherapy, and much of the effort is now focused on larger trials
to conﬁrm the preliminary hints of antitumor activity seen in
patients. Our studies have shown that combining SS1P with
