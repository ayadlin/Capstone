Abstract
The alkyloid compound ellipticine derived from the berrywood tree is a topoisomerase II poison that is used in
ovarian and breast cancer treatment. In this study, we report the identification of ellipticine derivatives and their
tetracyclic angular benzopyridoindole analogues as novel ATP-competitive inhibitors of the protein kinase CK2.
In vitro and in vivo assays showed that these compounds have a good pharmacologic profile, causing a marked
inhibition of CK2 activity associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human cancer cells. Further, in vivo
assays demonstrate antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft model of human glioblastoma. Finally, crystal
structures of CK2–inhibitor complex provide structural insights on the molecular basis of CK2 inhibition. Our
work lays the foundation for development of clinically useful CK2 inhibitors derived from a well-studied scaffold
with suitable pharmacokinetics parameters. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9865–74. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Protein kinases represent major therapeutic targets and
several kinase inhibitors have demonstrated powerful clinical
activity in pathologies in which the target kinase is dysregulated.
Protein kinase CK2 plays critical roles in cell growth, cell
differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenic transformation (1, 2).
CK2 has been found dysregulated in many cancers and its dual
function in promotion of cell growth and in suppression of
apoptosis may be particularly relevant to its oncogenic potential (3). The recent association of aberrant CK2 expression with
unfavorable prognostic markers in prostate cancer (4) and in
acute myeloid leukemia (5) supports the direct implication of
CK2 in tumor formation and recurrence. Indeed, CK2 is now
considered as a promising therapeutic target, supporting the
development of chemical inhibitors. Consequently, several

classes of CK2 inhibitors have been reported showing various
efficacy and specificity. Quercetin, emodin, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo1-benzotriazole (TBB), and indoloquinazolin derivative (IQA)
are representative of main classes of ATP-competitive CK2
inhibitors (6, 7). Other families were also described, such as
anthraquinone-related compounds, condensed polyphenolic,
7-substitued indoloquinazoline derivatives, and 2,8-difurandicarboxylic acid derivatives (8–11). However, so far, only a
single report described a CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945; Cylene
Pharmaceuticals) disclosing in vivo efficacy (http://www.
cylenepharma.com/cylene/pr_1230934977). Thus, broadening
the availability and diversity of CK2 inhibitors is warranted.
We have identified ellipticine and benzopyridoindole derivatives as new CK2 inhibitors. Ellipticine and its derivatives
exhibit antitumoral properties and are established chemotherapeutics (12), acting either by distinct or common
mechanisms of action. First, their intercalation in doublestranded DNA interferes with DNA replication or DNA transcription (13). Second, ellipticine induces topoisomerase
II–mediated transient DNA double-strand breaks, which have
been identified as the primary cellular target of the drug
(14, 15). A third mechanism involves DNA adduct formation
after P450 (CYP)-mediated activation of ellipticine in target
tissues (16). Several studies have also reported apoptosis
induction by ellipticine involving the p53 tumor suppressor
protein (17–19). Finally, protein kinase inhibition may also
represent a novel mechanism involved into ellipticine effect.
Cdk2-dependent p53 phosphorylation is selectively inhibited
by ellipticine and 9-hydroxyellipticine (20). Ellipticine derivatives have also inhibitory activity on c-Kit (21).
Here, we report that ellipticine and its benzopyridoindole
derivatives are in vitro and in vivo ATP-competitive CK2

inhibitors displaying antitumoral activity. We provide a rationale basis for the mode of action of these compounds on the
basis of the crystal structure of CK2a-inhibitor complexes.
Knowing that ellipticine displays good pharmacokinetics criteria, this new class of inhibitors is a source of attractive leads
for further optimization.

Material and Methods
Chemical libraries
The Institut Curie-CNRS library (6,560 compounds) and The
Prestwick Chemical Library (1,120 compounds) were screened
for CK2 inhibitors. Active compounds in the primary screen
were retested from freshly made solutions.
Cell culture
HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma), U373 (human
glioblastoma), MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial cells),
MESSA, and MESSA Dx5 (myosarcoma) cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
during 2005. Cells were cultured and stored according to the
supplier's instructions and used at passages 5 to 20. Briefly,
cells were routinely cultivated in Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
calf serum (BioWest), except for MCF-10A cells that were
maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with
5% horse serum, L-glutamine, 25 ng/mL human recombinant
EGF, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 10 mg/mL insulin, and 0.5 mg/
mL hydrocortisone. Cells were last tested in July 2009 through
cell morphology monitoring, growth curve analysis, and contamination checks.
Automated screening
Automated screening of chemical libraries was performed in
96-well plates using the automated platform of the CMBA
(centre de Criblage pour Molecules Bio-Actives, Grenoble)
screening facilities as described in the study of Prudent et al. (22).
CK2 phosphorylation assays
Compounds were tested in a radiometric CK2 assay performed in a final volume of 18 mL containing 1 mL of compound or equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as
control, 3 mL of CK2a (36 ng), and a mixture containing
100 mmol/L of peptide substrate (RRREDEESDDEE),
10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 100 mmol/L [g-32P]-ATP (6,000 Ci/
mmol). Assays were performed at room temperature for
5 minutes before termination by the addition of 60 mL of
4% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of 32P in the peptide
substrate was determined as previously described (23).
Protein purification and crystallization
A truncated active form of the catalytic a subunit of human
CK2 (CK2aDC) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified
as described in the study of Ermakova et al. (24). CK2aDC was
first crystallized using hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. Crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 2 mL of
CK2aDC–Mg2þ–substrate peptide mix [4.6 mgmL-1 CK2aDC,

114 mmol/L peptide substrate RRREDEESDDEE, 680 mmol/L
MgCl2, 340 mmol/L adenosine 50 -(b,g-imido)triphosphate]
with 2 mL of precipitant solution (36% polyethylene glycol
5000 monomethyl ether, 150 mmol/L ammonium sulfate, and
100 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Crystals of ellipticine and
benzopyridoindole derivative–CK2aDC complexes were then
obtained by soaking techniques: crystals were soaked for
1 week in a 4-mL drop of same composition as crystallization
drop except that adenosine 50 -(b,g-imido)triphosphate was
replaced by 300 mmol/L of these derivatives.
Structure determination and refinement
For X-ray diffraction data collection, CK2aDC complex
crystals were directly flash frozen in liquid nitrogen without
adding any extra cryoprotectant. All data were collected at
173.15°C on beamlines of either ID23-eh1 or ID23-eh2 of the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at a wave
length of 1.072 or 0.834 A using an ADSC Quantum 315R CCD
detector. Data processing was performed using XDS (25) and
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The CK2aDC complex
structures were determined by molecular replacement
method with AMoRe (26) from the CCP4 suite (27) using
the CK2aDC structure as search model [pdb code: 1PJK, (24)].
The final models were obtained after several rounds of alternate manual building with coot (28) and maximum likelihood
refinement with Refmac5 of CCP4 (29), and using data in all
available resolution range. The final refinement statistics are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Pymol was used to
generate structure figures. The structure factors and coordinates are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the
accession numbers: 3OWJ, 3OWK, and 3OWL.
Kinase selectivity profiling
Kinase selectivity of compound 18 was assessed using a
panel of 57 recombinant protein kinases. The assays were
performed at 10 mmol/L ATP in the presence of 10 mmol/L
inhibitor using the Kinase profiler panel service (Millipore).
Inhibition, expressed as the percent of activity determined in
the absence of inhibitor, was calculated from the residual
activity measured in the presence of 10 mmol/L inhibitor.
Cellular CK2 activity assay
Cellular CK2 activity was assayed as previously described (22,
30). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with a chimeric yellow
fluorescent protein–based CK2 activity reporter (pEYFPc1-SbS).
Phosphorylation status of the reporter was measured using the
monoclonal antibody anti-GFP/yellow fluorescent protein
(Roche, ref. 1814460) at 1/1,000 and the goat anti-mouse HRP
as secondary antibody (Sigma, ref. A4416).
Murine xenograft tumor assay
All experimental procedures adhered to our local ethical
committee (Comite regional d’ethique pour l’Experimentation animale CREEA, Rhône Alpes, protocol no. 286). Female
Harlan athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks) were inoculated
subcutaneously into the right flank with 7.5  105 U373
cells. When tumors reached 50 mm3 (volume ¼ length 
width  height), animals were treated intraperitoneally

(0.14 mg/100 mL per injection), or equivalent amount of
DMSO (10% final) dissolved in PEG3350 22.5%, bovine serum
albumin 0.45%. Body weight and tumor volume were determined twice a week. The experiment was terminated when
tumor volume reached about 1,000 mm3. Results are presented as mean  SEM.

Results
Discovery of new CK2 inhibitors by automated
screening
So far, only few CK2 inhibitors display suitable pharmacokinetics criteria for in vivo investigations. To find new CK2
inhibitor scaffolds appropriate for in vivo uses, we screened
the Prestwick Chemical Library. This library contains small
molecules that were selected for their known bioavailability
and safety in humans. The expectation was to identify
hits that exhibit correct bioavailability and toxicity. These
hits could provide good starting points for optimization
program.
The library was screened in an automated luminescencebased kinase assay using human recombinant CK2a catalytic
subunit (Supplementary Fig. S1). Screening data were normalized and analyzed using an in-house software, TAMIS (Tool to
Analysis and Manage Informations of Screening, Version 2.0;
CEA, Grenoble, France). CK2 kinase inhibitory activity was
determined at compound concentration of 10 mmol/L, using
TBB and DMSO as positive and negative controls, respectively.
Up to 24 compounds belonging to several distinct structural
families showed inhibition greater than 50%. Among those
hits, ellipticine was the only drug with therapeutic indication
in oncology. To identify more potent and selective CK2
inhibitors we performed a focused screen on ellipticine derivatives present in the Institut Curie-CNRS small molecule
library (Supplementary Fig. S1).
This led to the identification of benzopyridoindole derivatives (31, 32). Radiometric CK2 kinase assay showed that 1,
8, 16, 18, 19 efficiently inhibited kinase activity in a dosedependent manner (Table 1) with IC50 ranging from 0.31 to
1.5 mmol/L. This represents a 10- to 50-fold improvement in
inhibitor potency when compared with our primary hit,
ellipticine (in these conditions, IC50 for ellipticine is
15.4 mmol/L ).
Chemical features of pyridocarbazole derivatives
conferring CK2 inhibitory potency
To define the mode of CK2 inhibition by compound 1, we
performed steady-state kinetic analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Lineweaver–Burk inhibition plots showed that CK2
inhibition by compound 1 is ATP competitive, with Ki ¼
0.86 mmol/L . Similar inhibitory potencies were found using
CK2 holoenzyme (data not shown).
To gain insights into the features conferring inhibitory
potency to compound 1, we tested a set of derivatives
(Table 1). Position 11 is relatively tolerant because substitution of methyl by hydrogen also leads to an active compound
(compound 8) albeit less potent. In contrast, the free hydroxyl

www.aacrjournals.org

substituent at position 9 (compounds 1 and 8) is necessary
because analogues bearing substituents other than hydroxyl
(e.g., ether, ester) are less active or inactive even when assayed
at 10 mmol/L (compounds 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
and 17).
Similarly, methylation of N2 is also not tolerated because
compound 3 is inactive. In line with this observation, compound 5, which is fully substituted at positions 2, 9, and 11, is
also inactive. Position 1 also seems to be relatively tolerant
because replacement of lactam function (compound 8) by
chloro group (compound 16) leads to active compound.
Whether compounds 11, 12, and 13 are inactive because
position 9 bears methoxy group or position 1 bears too
bulky/hydrophobic substituents remains unknown.
Interestingly, although compounds 14, 15, and 17 bear
methoxy groups at position 9, they display residual inhibitory
potency. In the same trend, ellipticine is active (albeit at higher
concentration). This observation indicates that unfavorable
substitution at this important position can be counterbalanced by a network of favorable substitutions at other positions. We next investigated the features of the scaffold
required for activity. Available pyridoindole (or g-carboline)
derivatives bearing 3 fused rings exhibit poor or no activity
(data not shown), meaning that 4 rings are necessary for
optimal activity. We tested several available angular tetracyclic compounds related to intoplicine, which corresponds to
antitumor agent inhibiting both topoisomerase I and II activities (33). Surprisingly, 2 compounds belonging to benzo[g]and benzo[e]-pyridoindole (or BgPI and BePI) (compounds 18
and 19, respectively) are potent CK2 inhibitors (Table 2). This
indicates some tolerance into the scaffold of these new CK2
inhibitors.
In summary, regarding linear tetracyclic ellipticine derivatives, it appears that positions 9 and N2 are crucial for
activity whereas positions 1 and 11 are relatively tolerant.
Moreover, some variations into the scaffold of the molecule
are allowed. Indeed, the angular tetracyclic analogues BgPI
and BePI, which are structurally related to ellipticine, also
exhibit significant CK2 inhibitory potencies.
Pyridocarbazole derivatives are multitarget
compounds
Given the multiple targets of ellipticine and derivatives, we
compared our structure-activity relationship data with published data (Supplementary Table S2), and on c-Kit (21) and
topoisomerase II (15). This analysis showed differences in
structure-activity relationship according to the targets. For
instance, whereas C1 substitution does not have a strong
influence on topoisomerase II and CK2a activities, it is detrimental on c-Kit inhibitory potency when substituted by bulky
groups. In contrast, N2 substitution is detrimental for CK2a
inhibitory potency, but has no effect on topoisomerase II and cKit inhibition. N6 substitution has no influence on topoisomerase II, but is detrimental for c-Kit and CK2a inhibition. A
common feature of the 3 targets is the presence of hydroxyl on
position 9 in active compounds. Taken together, these observations indicate that distinct chemical requirements are necessary to selectively inhibit each of the 3 targets.

Figure 1. A, ellipticine inhibition of CK2 activity in living cells. HeLa cells
transfected with a plasmid expressing a chimeric CK2 activity GFP-based
reporter were incubated with the CK2 inhibitor TBB, ellipticine, or DMSO
(as control) for 24 hours. Cell extracts were then analyzed by native
electrophoresis and GFP was revealed by immunoblotting. The arrow
indicates the CK2-phosphorylated form of the reporter. B, selected
derivatives that were active in vitro were submitted to the cell-based CK2
activity assay as in A. þ, a significant decrease in the phosphorylated
form of the CK2 activity reporter (lower band in A and in Supplementary
Fig. S3).

Pyridocarbazole derivatives are cell-potent CK2
inhibitors
We assayed the inhibitory potencies of pyridocarbazole
derivatives on living cells using a cell-based CK2 kinase assay
(Fig. 1) (22, 34). In control HeLa cells, the CK2 activity reporter
could be detected as a phosphorylated form (lower band in
Fig. 1A). When cells were treated with the known CK2
inhibitor TBB, the phosphorylated CK2 reporter form disappeared. Interestingly, 50 mmol/L ellipticine triggered a similar
strong inhibition (Fig. 1A). Other derivatives selected in the
present work were found to be active in cells at similar or even
lower concentrations (compounds 1, 8, 18, 19) (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S3).
Ellipticine and B[g/e]PI derivatives inhibit cell viability
through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
Because both ellipticine and CK2 inhibitors are known to
affect cell survival, we measured cell viability of p53wt HeLa
cells after 48-hour treatment with TBB, ellipticine, or angular
compounds 18 and 19 (Fig. 2A). B[g/e]PI derivatives reduced
cell viability more efficiently than TBB (IC50 of 2–10 mmol/L
and 20 mmol/L, respectively). Interestingly, in p53mut U373
glioblastoma cells, 5 mmol/L of pyridocarbazole derivatives
was sufficient to decrease cell viability by 50% whereas in
these conditions, TBB was not efficient (Fig. 2B). U373 cells
harbor a TP53 mutant isoform and are particularly resistant to
drug-induced apoptosis. Other cancer cell lines such as wildtype or resistant myosarcoma cells (MESSA and MESSA Dx5,

www.aacrjournals.org

respectively) were highly sensitive to ellipticine and to a lower
extent to compounds 18 and 19. Of note, the cell viability of
the nontransformed MCF10A mammary epithelial cells was
also strongly affected by ellipticine, whereas compounds 18
and 19 had a much weaker effect. As cell viability inhibition
induced by ellipticine was reported to be correlated with cell
cycle arrest (35), we measured the effect of ellipticine and
B[g/e]PI derivatives on cell cycle distribution of HeLa and
U373 cells (Fig. 3A). Compared with vehicle-treated cells, 18or 19-treated U373 cells exhibited a cell cycle arrest in G2/M
phase. The treatment also caused an appreciable accumulation of the cells in sub-G1 phase. We next assessed the effects
of the compounds on the induction of apoptosis in U373 cells
by (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL). The results showed that 18 or
19 treatment results in the accumulation of TUNEL-positive
cells. This effect was more pronounced with Ellipticine or
staurosporine treatments (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the same treatments induced an increase of caspase-dependent apoptosis
attested by the activation of caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 3C).
Although these compounds are cell-potent CK2 inhibitors,
we noticed that except for ellipticine, the active concentrations able to induce marked CK2 inhibition were higher than
those required to induce cytotoxicity. Ellipticine is known as a
multitarget agent, thus our selected active benzopyridoindole
derivatives could, beside CK2a, affect other targets involved in
cell viability. Indeed, when kinase selectivity of compound 18
was profiled, several kinases involved in cancer-related pathways such as Pim-1, Mnk2, and DARK1 were significantly
affected (Supplementary Table S3).
Benzopyridoindole derivatives inhibit
colony formation and tumor growth
To ascertain the potential therapeutic interest of compounds 18 and 19, we first tested their ability to inhibit
colony formation using soft agar assay as an in vitro surrogate of tumorigenesis. U373 cells can grow without anchorage and form colonies in soft agar culture, reflecting their
malignant properties. Both compounds 18 and 19 at a
concentration of 5 mmol/L inhibited drastically colony formation (Fig. 4A). In comparison, a weak inhibition of colony
formation (10%) was observed in response to 50 mmol/L of
TBB (data not shown).
Next, murine xenograft tumor assays were carried out to
assess both toxicity and efficiency of compound 18, which
showed the best inhibitory activities toward cell viability and
colony formation. In mice treated with compound 18, we
observed a significant reduction of tumor incidence, whatever the time point. Three weeks after first compound
injection, mice injected with compound 18 had tumors that
were 5 to 6 times smaller than those injected with DMSO
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, mice were healthy after repetitive
injections of the compound. They grew normally without
significant weight loss. In addition, no obvious toxic effects
were observed when the experiment was terminated and the
tumors removed, indicating that compound 18 was relatively well tolerated at doses sufficient to induce antitumoral
effect.

compounds and CK2 are mainly hydrophobic and involve
mainly residues 53, 66, and 174. They use the plane formed
by 2 adjacent cycles to fit perfectly into the "purine plane''
naturally occupied by the ATP adenine moiety (24, 36).
However, they differ in their orientation to conserve specific
interactions between the common atoms of their scaffold
and of the ATP groove. For instance, the common hydroxyl
group (at position 9) of the 3 derivatives forms a direct
hydrogen bond with the main chain nitrogen of Val 116 that
mimics the classical ATP/CK2 interaction. But, the

Discussion
Despite many published CK2 inhibitors with various modes
of inhibition (37, 38), only few were successfully validated in
vivo. In this work, first we report that pyridocarbazole and its
angular analogues B[g/e]PI are in vitro potent submicromolar
ATP-competitive CK2a inhibitors. Substitution requirements
in pyridocarbazole derivatives are different for efficient inhibition of CK2 than substitution required for other known ellipticine targets (c-kit, topoisomerase IIa, DNA intercalation).
This can give guidelines for compound optimization. Second,
these compounds are also active on cellular CK2 kinase activity
and induce cell cycle arrest of a glioblastoma cell line.
Proteins involved in the cells’ suicide program such as ARC,
Bid, and p53 (2) are some of the many cellular substrates of

CK2 (39). Indeed, we observed that in response to pyridocarbazole derivatives, HeLa cells showed caspase-dependent
apoptosis. Cytotoxic effect may be partially due to CK2
inhibition because cytotoxicity appeared at concentrations
lower than those required to achieve complete CK2a inhibition. Most of cancer cells rely, however, on high CK2 activity as
judged from their susceptibility to CK2 inhibitors or silencing
of CK2 catalytic subunits (40). This undue reliance of tumor
cells on CK2 activity may explain their high sensitivity to the
pyridocarbazole derivatives. Another explanation is that these
compounds target other cellular proteins such as prosurvival
kinases. Indeed, kinase selectivity profiling of compound 18
showed that several kinases were significantly affected: Pim-1
and Mnk2, which are involved in cancer-related pathways (41),
and DRAK1, which is related to death-associated protein
kinases that trigger apoptosis (42). It is now accepted that
high specificity is not a requisite for potent drugs (43) and that
polypharmacology is an underlying mechanism essential in
drug actions (43). Indeed, hitting more than 1 kinase at once
can prevent cells to bypass the primary target by activating
redundant signaling pathways (44). Interestingly, when
assayed in a murine xenograft tumor growth assay, 1 of our
compounds (18) exhibited antitumoral activity without
apparent toxic effects. We conclude that this chemical class
of leads seems to be safe enough to represent a good starting
point for future optimization.
We have solved 3 CK2a–inhibitor complex structures.
Crystal structure of CK2–compound 1 complex provides a
clear explanation for the differential potency of various pyridocarbazole derivatives. The intolerance to any substitution
except hydroxyl group at position 9 is fully explained by the
crucial hydrogen bond that compound 1 makes with CK2a

9872

backbone, and that mimics interactions between ATP and
CK2. However, the disruption of this crucial hydrogen bond
can be partially compensated by extra interactions involving
other residues as in compounds 14, 15, and 17, which bear
polar groups either at position 1 or at position 2 and have
residual inhibition capacity. Those groups would be there in
favorable position to interact with CK2a residues Leu45 and
His160. This is exemplified by the substitution in compound
16 , which bears a chlorine group as compound 15 and a
hydroxyl group as compound 1, and retains full inhibition
potency. However, in contrast to CK2a–compound 1 structure, the structures of CK2a in complex with compounds 18
and 19 revealed that their orientations are flipped by 180
degree, which lead their chlorine group to fit into the ATP
cavity. Therefore, the position of such polar group cannot
easily be predicted. Concerning position 11, reduction of this
group volume by the substitution of a methyl group (in
compound 1) by an atom of hydrogen (in compound 3) is
correlated with a decreased inhibition (higher IC50). This can
be easily explained by the disruption of hydrophobic contacts
between the methyl group and Met163 and Leu45 of CK2a.
However, as the number of those contacts is in minority as
compared with the overall network between compound 1 and
CK2a, this disruption has a limited impact on IC50 suggesting
that position 11 would be tolerant to bulkier substituents. The
structures of CK2a in complex with compounds 18 and 19
illustrate the ability of the CK2 ATP-binding groove to bind
benzopyridoindole derivatives with "cycle'' configurations different from the original ellipticine, as long as they remain
perfectly plane to fit into the purine plane. Furthermore, it
appears crucial to keep the OH group at position 9 to mimic
ATP/CK2 interaction as for compound 1.

Antitumor Activity of Pyridocarbazole and Benzopyridoindole

To conclude, this class of pyridocarbazole and benzopyridoindole derivatives has a well-mastered chemistry and
displays new biological activities and good pharmacokinetic
profile. Its high potency, the well-explored structure-activity
relationship and the solved structure of these compounds in
complex with CK2 will provide a good starting point for
further optimization processes.
