BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy has been established as a standard treatment option in
the first-line setting for advanced nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there has been no evidence to support
the use of bevacizumab beyond disease progression in such patients. METHODS: West Japan Oncology Group 5910L was designed as
a multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial of docetaxel versus docetaxel plus bevacizumab every 3 weeks for patients with
recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC whose disease had progressed after first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus a
platinum-based doublet. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomly
assigned to receive docetaxel (n 5 50) or docetaxel plus bevacizumab (n 5 50), and this yielded median PFS times of 3.4 and 4.4
months, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.71 and a stratified log-rank P value of .058, which met the predefined criterion for
statistical significance (P <.2). The median overall survival also tended to be longer in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group (13.1
months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6-21.4 months) versus the docetaxel group (11.0 months; 95% CI, 7.6-16.1 months) with an HR of
0.74 (95% CI, 0.46-1.19; stratified log-rank P 5.11). No unexpected or severe adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Further evaluation of bevacizumab beyond disease progression is warranted for patients with advanced NSCLC whose disease has progressed after

that contribute to the various biological behaviors of malignant tumors, including NSCLC. Platinum-based
chemotherapy regimens are the standard first-line treatment for individuals with advanced NSCLC who do not
harbor identifiable driver oncogenes such as mutant forms
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene or
translocations involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
gene, but the efficacy of such regimens has reached a plateau.2-5 Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
to vascular endothelial growth factor, has been found to
improve outcomes when it is added to standard chemotherapy regimens for bevacizumab-naive patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer,6,7 metastatic breast cancer,810
or nonsquamous NSCLC11,12 in the first-line setting,
with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy having now
become a standard treatment option for these patients.
Consistent with preclinical studies showing that angiogenesis is essential throughout the life cycle of a tumor,1315
a recent randomized, phase 3 study found that continuation of bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease had progressed after standard
first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy resulted in a
significant improvement in both progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS).16 The effect of the continuation of bevacizumab after first-line bevacizumabcontaining therapy for advanced NSCLC has been
unknown, however. We, therefore, designed the current
randomized trial to evaluate the continuation of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone
in NSCLC patients whose disease had progressed after
treatment with bevacizumab plus platinum-based
chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients

This open-label, randomized, phase 2 study (West Japan
Oncology Group 5910L) was designed to evaluate the
addition of bevacizumab to standard therapy with docetaxel in NSCLC patients whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus a platinum-based
doublet. The study protocol has been previously published.17 We included patients who were 20 years old or
older and had histologically or cytologically confirmed
recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. A patient who had received preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy was eligible if the last
administration of the prior adjuvant regimen occurred at
least 12 months before the onset of platinum-based

chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Patients with a history
of treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib) before platinum-based chemotherapy
plus bevacizumab were also eligible if they harbored an
EGFR mutation. Patients with central nervous system metastases were allowed to enter the trial after previous treatment with central nervous system radiation therapy or
neurosurgery (or both) if the metastases had not progressed. This study did not restrict patient eligibility on
the basis of the time to registration after the last administration of the first-line treatment. Adequate bone marrow,
renal, and liver function was required. A baseline computed tomography scan was mandatory within the 28
days before registration. A lesion not previously irradiated
that was measurable according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) was required for
the evaluation of response.
Exclusion criteria included the following: prior
treatment with docetaxel; active hemoptysis or a recent
history of hemoptysis (>1/2 teaspoon); central nervous
system metastases without any prior local treatment;
active thrombosis or embolism; serious infection; serious
uncontrolled medical conditions, including heart disease,
diabetes, and hypertension; uncontrolled effusion (pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial effusion requiring drainage
for symptom management); major surgery within the 4
weeks before registration; minor surgical procedures, radiation therapy, or transfusion within the previous 14 days;
evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis
on the baseline chest X-ray; pregnancy or lactation; and a
history of cancer other than NSCLC within the previous
5 years. All patients provided written informed consent,
and the study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by
the institutional review board at each study site.
Randomization and Masking

In this multicenter, phase 2 trial, patients were randomly
assigned on a 1:1 basis to docetaxel or docetaxel plus bevacizumab by the central randomization with minimization
method. Patients were stratified on the basis of 1) the
baseline ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), 2) a history of treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(gefitinib or erlotinib vs neither), 3) the duration of treatment with bevacizumab plus a platinum-based doublet
(<6 vs 6 weeks), and 4) the time to disease progression
after the last bevacizumab administration of the first-line
treatment (<3 vs 3 weeks). All patients and investigators
were unmasked to treatment allocation.

Procedures

Patients received docetaxel (60 mg/m2, which is the

disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in
the docetaxel plus bevacizumab arm were allowed to
receive docetaxel alone as a result of bevacizumab-related
toxicity, but they were not allowed to receive bevacizumab
alone. No more than 2 dose reductions of docetaxel (to 50
and 40 mg/m2) were permitted, and no dose reductions
were allowed for bevacizumab. The relative dose intensity
of chemotherapy was calculated as follows:

=Total planned duration ðweeksÞ
Patients underwent a tumor assessment at the baseline, every 4 weeks during the first 12 weeks, and every 6
weeks thereafter. Adverse events were recorded on the basis of the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 4.0). Poststudy treatment was at the discretion of physicians and patients.
Statistical Analysis

The trial was based on a randomized, phase 2 screening
design, which allowed us to assess whether the experimental regimen was more promising than the standard control
regimen with respect to PFS, as described previously.20
The primary endpoint was PFS, which was defined as the
time from enrollment to the date of disease progression or
death. Secondary endpoints included OS, response rates,
and safety. This trial required a total of 90 progression
events to detect a 30% risk reduction with 80% statistical
power (with a median PFS of 2 months assumed for the
control arm) and with a 1-sided significance level of .2.20
The targeted accrual was planned to be 50 patients per
arm. The protocol originally stipulated that a stratified
log-rank test be used to compare PFS curves between the
2 arms with the 4 stratification factors described previously; as a result of the sparseness of the distribution for
factors 1 to 3, however (Table 1), we stipulated in the statistical analysis plan before data analysis that the stratified
test would be performed with factor 4 to prevent a loss of
statistical power. Survival curves were estimated with the
Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios (HRs) for the 2
arms were estimated with the stratified Cox proportional
hazards model. Confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
on the basis of Greenwood’s formula. Response rates were
compared with Fisher’s exact test. An efficacy analysis was
performed for the full analysis set, which consisted of all
randomized patients with confirmed eligibility. All tests
were 1-sided, and all statistical analysis was performed

demographics and clinical characteristics of the subjects,
including previous responses to first-line therapy, were
well balanced between the 2 treatment groups (Table 1).
Most patients were male and smokers; had a good performance status (0 or 1), stage IV disease, and adenocarcinoma histology; and were wild-type for EGFR.
Treatment Delivery

The median number of treatment cycles per patient was 4
for both the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group (range, 116) and the docetaxel group (range, 1-36). The relative
dose intensity for docetaxel was 88.6% (range, 0%100%) in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group and
94.2% (range, 67.5%-100%) in the docetaxel group, and
the relative dose intensity for bevacizumab was 91.6%
(range, 24.0%-100%). Twenty-six patients (52%) in the
docetaxel plus bevacizumab group and 18 patients (36%)
in the docetaxel group underwent a dose reduction for
docetaxel, and 8 patients (16%) had a dose interruption
for bevacizumab (Table 2).
Efficacy

At the data cutoff for the primary analysis of PFS (May
20, 2014), 90 progression events had occurred, and the
1054

median follow-up time was 11.2 months (interquartile
range, 6.4-17.8 months). The median PFS was 4.4
months for docetaxel plus bevacizumab and 3.4 months
for docetaxel (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.09; Fig. 2A).
The 1-sided P value for the stratified log-rank test was
0.058, which met the predefined criterion for statistical
significance (P < .2). The median OS tended to be longer
(by 2.1 months) in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group
(13.1 months; 95% CI, 10.6-21.4 months) versus the
docetaxel group (11.0 months; 95% CI, 7.6-16.1
months) with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.46-1.19; stratified log-rank P 5 .11; Fig. 2B).
Forty-six patients in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab
group and 48 patients in the docetaxel group were evaluable for a response (Table 3). The objective response rate
was 36% (95% CI, 22.9%-50.8%) in the docetaxel plus
bevacizumab group and 26% (95% CI, 14.6%-40.3%) in
the docetaxel group (P 5 .387). The disease control rate
was the same in both groups at 62% (95% CI, 47.2%75.3%; P 5 1.00). A waterfall plot of maximum tumor
shrinkage from the baseline is shown for each group in

or 26.5%).
A subgroup analysis of PFS according to demographics and baseline characteristics, including sex, age,
ECOG performance status, and smoking status, was consistent with the primary analysis and favored the docetaxel
plus bevacizumab group (Fig. 4). An analysis of additional
subgroups revealed that patients who achieved a complete
response or partial response to first-line treatment with
bevacizumab plus a platinum-based doublet and those
who were registered in the current study at least 6 months
after the initiation of first-line chemotherapy appeared to
derive greater benefit from docetaxel plus bevacizumab
than patients experiencing stable disease or progressive
disease and those patients registered within <6 months,
respectively. The addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel
in patients with a time to progressive disease after the
last bevacizumab administration of the first-line
treatment  3 weeks led to a significant improvement in
the median PFS from 3.3 to 5.4 months (HR, 0.55; 95%

at grade 3 or worse were low in both groups (6% vs 2%
for hypertension, 0% vs 0% for hemorrhagic events, and
4% vs 0% for proteinuria; Table 4). No arterial thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction and
cerebrovascular events, were reported. Seventeen patients
(34%) in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group and 12
patients (24%) in the docetaxel group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The number of adverse
events leading to death was low in both the docetaxel plus
bevacizumab group (interstitial lung disease, n 5 1) and
the docetaxel group (pneumonia, n 5 1).

Hematologic events of grade 3 or worse occurring in at

The incidence of grade 3 or worse leukopenia (64% vs
52%) and neutropenia (90% vs 82%) was higher in
patients treated with docetaxel plus bevacizumab versus
those receiving docetaxel alone, whereas the incidence of
febrile neutropenia was the same (26%) in both treatment
groups. Among nonhematologic toxicities, hypertension
(40% vs 24%), hemorrhagic events (40% vs 6%), and
proteinuria (46% vs 18%) of all grades occurred more frequently in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group versus
the docetaxel group, although the rates of these toxicities

DISCUSSION
The current study (West Japan Oncology Group 5910L)
was designed to evaluate the potential benefit of bevacizumab in addition to docetaxel in NSCLC patients whose
disease had progressed after first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus a platinum-based doublet. Our study has
demonstrated an improved PFS in patients treated with
docetaxel plus bevacizumab in comparison with those
receiving docetaxel alone (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.09,
P 5 .058). We adopted a 1-sided significance level of .2
on the basis of a randomized, phase 2 screening design for
a nondefinitive, randomized comparison of an experimental regimen with a standard treatment.20 Indeed, several randomized, phase 2 trials for advanced NSCLC have
adopted this same 1-sided significance level.21-23
Although our results met the threshold significance level
for the log-rank test (P 5 .058), they require careful interpretation because of the marginal effect of the addition of
bevacizumab to docetaxel.
The magnitude of the improvement in PFS in our
study (HR, 0.71) is similar to that achieved in the
ML18147 trial (HR, 0.68)16 and the TANIA trial (HR,

0.75),24 which investigated the use of bevacizumab
beyond progression in metastatic colorectal cancer and
advanced breast cancer, respectively. The improvement in
OS observed in the current study (HR, 0.74) is also similar to that obtained in the ML18147 trial (HR, 0.81).
However, whether the PFS benefit achieved with bevacizumab beyond disease progression in our study translates
into an OS benefit warrants careful consideration because
OS may be influenced by the effect of postprogression
treatments.25 Although the proportion of patients who
received postprotocol therapy did not differ significantly
between the 2 treatment groups (P 5 .19), more patients
treated with docetaxel plus bevacizumab (78%) received
postprotocol therapy than did those treated with docetaxel
alone (64%; Table 5). Among the 6 patients (12%) who
received EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors as postprotocol
therapy in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group, 1 individual harbored an EGFR mutation, whereas none of the
3 patients (6%) who received postprotocol treatment with
these drugs in the docetaxel group did.
The objective response rate in the docetaxel group of
the current study was 26%, which is higher than that
(13%-18%) reported in phase 3 studies of second-line
therapies for advanced NSCLC conducted in Japan.18,19
The favorable response to prior chemotherapy in the current study (objective response rate: 70% for the docetaxel
plus bevacizumab group and 68% for the docetaxel
group) may account for the higher response rate to
second-line chemotherapy.
In our study, patients were eligible for enrollment
regardless of the response to or duration of prior treatment with a platinum-based doublet plus bevacizumab.
Our subset analysis revealed that a longer PFS was
achieved by patients in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab
group who achieved a complete response or partial
response to first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus a
platinum doublet and by those for whom the time from
the initiation of first-line chemotherapy to registration in
the current study was 6 months. These findings are consistent with those of the ML18147 trial, which showed
that a better clinical outcome of treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was achieved in patients who
experienced a long first-line PFS versus those who did
not.16 Because tumor revascularization was shown to
occur after the removal of anti–vascular endothelial
growth factor therapy in a preclinical study,13 we adopted
the time to progressive disease (<3 vs 3 weeks) after the
last bevacizumab administration of the first-line treatment
as a stratification factor. The continued use of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel in patients with a
Cancer

time to progressive disease after the last bevacizumab
administration  3 weeks led to a significant improvement in PFS, whereas no such effect was seen in patients
with a corresponding interval < 3 weeks. The longer
interval from the last bevacizumab administration to progressive disease might allow the restoration of sensitivity
to bevacizumab in the former individuals. The results of
our subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution,
however, because of the small number of patients analyzed
and the substantial risk of a selection bias.
Several therapies that target angiogenesis are currently under development for the treatment of NSCLC
patients in the second-line setting. The REVEL trial, a
randomized, phase 3 study of docetaxel plus ramucirumab
versus docetaxel plus a placebo in the second-line setting
for advanced NSCLC patients, demonstrated a significant
improvement in PFS and OS in the former arm.26 The
LUME-Lung 1 trial, a randomized, phase 3 study of docetaxel plus nintedanib versus docetaxel as second-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC, showed that PFS
was significantly longer in the docetaxel plus nintedanib
group.27 The VITAL trial, a randomized, phase 3 study of
docetaxel plus aflibercept versus docetaxel alone in the
second-line setting for patients with advanced NSCLC,
showed a benefit from the combination regimen in terms
of PFS.28 These studies have thus indicated that angiogenesis inhibitors enhance the antitumor activity of standard
chemotherapy for NSCLC patients in the second-line setting. However, these 3 trials included only a small number
of patients who received bevacizumab as first-line therapy
(14%, 4%, and 12% in REVEL, LUME-Lung 1, and
VITAL, respectively). In contrast, our study was the first
randomized trial to restrict eligibility to individuals whose
disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab
plus a platinum-based doublet and thus to demonstrate
the potential impact of continued use of bevacizumab
beyond disease progression in NSCLC.
In agreement with previous phase 3 studies of bevacizumab and chemotherapy, we found that the addition
of bevacizumab to docetaxel was associated with a slight
increase in toxicity (grades 1 or 2), particularly with
respect to hypertension, proteinuria, and hemorrhagic
events. The incidence of grade 3 or worse hematologic
adverse events (leukopenia and neutropenia) was also
higher in the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group. The
small increase in the incidence of these adverse events in
the docetaxel plus bevacizumab group may have led to the
higher discontinuation rate in this group (34% vs 24% in
the docetaxel group). Although patients in the docetaxel
plus bevacizumab group had received long-term
1057

bevacizumab treatment in the first- and second-line settings, no unexpected or severe adverse events were
recorded, and this suggests that continuation of bevacizumab beyond disease progression is tolerable in individuals
with advanced NSCLC.
There are several limitations to our study, including
its small sample size and its hypothesis-generating, nondefinitive, randomized, phase 2 trial design with a high a
level (.2). A confirmatory phase 3 trial (AvaALL) is currently under way to assess the continuation of bevacizumab beyond disease progression in patients with advanced
NSCLC after first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus
platinum-based chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01351415).29
