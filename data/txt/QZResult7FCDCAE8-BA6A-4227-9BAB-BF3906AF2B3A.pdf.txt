ABSTRACT
Proteasome inhibition is an attractive approach for anticancer therapy.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used for treatment in a number of cancers including
breast cancer; however, the development of DOX resistance largely limits its clinical
application. One of the possible mechanisms of DOX-resistance is that DOX might
induce the activation of NF-κB. In this case, proteasome inhibitors could inhibit the
activation of NF-κB by blocking inhibitory factor κB (IκB) degradation. Carfilzomib,
a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, overcomes bortezomib resistance and
lessens its side-effects. Currently, the effect of carfilzomib on breast cancer cell
proliferation remains unclear. In this study, we exploited the role of carfilzomib in
seven breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, T-47D, MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231, and BT-549, representing all major molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
We found that carfilzomib alone had cytotoxic effects on the breast cancer cells and it
increased DOX-induced cytotoxic effects and apoptosis in combination by enhancing
DOX-induced JNK phosphorylation and inhibiting DOX-induced IκBα degradation. The
results suggest that carfilzomib has potent antitumor effects on breast cancer in vitro
and can sensitize breast cancer cells to DOX treatment. DOX in combination with
carfilzomib may be an effective and feasible therapeutic option in the clinical trials
for treating breast cancer.

substrate proteins and, ultimately, cell death [2]. Over
the last several decades, proteasome inhibition has
been extensively investigated as a selective anti-cancer
strategy and validated in clinical trials using first- and

second-generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs)[3]. The
mechanisms of the antitumor activity of PIs are inhibition
of proteasome activity, down-regulation of nuclear factor
κB (NF-κB) signaling through blocking inhibitory factor
κB (IκB) degradation, induction of cancer cell apoptosis
through production of the pro-apoptotic factor tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), stabilization of p53, and
interference with a number of different cell cycle signaling
pathways, e.g. AKT, MAPK, and c-Jun [4, 5].
Proteasome inhibition has proven to be an effective
therapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma and mantle
cell lymphoma [6, 7]. Bortezomib, a first-generation PI,
was the first to be approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for treatment of multiple myeloma
in 2003 and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma
in 2006 [8]. Second-generation PI carfilzomib (CFZ, PR171) is the second FDA-approved PI for the treatment of
recurrent multiple myeloma [9]. CFZ is an irreversible
tetrapeptide epoxyketone PI that selectively inhibits
the chymotrypsin-like activity of the constitutive 20S
proteasome and the immunoproteasome [2]. Compared to
bortezomib, CFZ has minimal off-target effects on nonproteasome, serine proteases which is thought to explain
its reduced neurotoxicity as compared to that of other PIs
[10]. CFZ overcomes bortezomib resistance and lessens
side effects in patients treated with bortezomib [9]. These
agents have also been studied in solid tumors in a number
of phase I and II clinical trials [11, 12], yet they have not
shown consistent antitumor activity in solid tumors. At
present, the effect of carfilzomib on breast cancer cell
proliferation remains unclear.
Breast cancer is a common malignancy affecting
women of all ages [13]. While targeted therapy has
proven effective in a subset of breast cancer patients, new
molecularly targeted agents are necessary for breast cancer
patients whose tumors develop resistance to chemotherapy.
Doxorubicin (DOX, Adriamycin), an anthracycline,
inhibits DNA/RNA synthesis by intercalation between
base pairs of DNA strands, inducing apoptosis of tumor
cells. Despite the wide use of DOX in cancer treatment,
acquired drug resistance and profound cytotoxicity
largely limits its clinical application potential [14, 15].
Hence, combined treatment with some sensitizing agent is
desirable to overcome the resistance to DOX and increase
the antitumor effects. One of the explanations for DOX
resistance is that DOX could induce the activation of NFκB [16]. PIs are known to selectively target cancer cells
and make them more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents.
Given the potential for improved efficacy and greater
tolerability of CFZ and CFZ’s known down-regulation
of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, we investigated
the antitumor activity of CFZ in a panel of molecularly
unique breast cancer cell lines alone or in combination
with DOX. Here we report that CFZ alone resulted in
potent inhibition of cellular proliferation and induction of
apoptosis, sensitized cells to DOX-induced toxicity, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

intensified DOX-induced apoptosis in combination across
a diverse set of breast cancer cell lines in vitro.

RESULTS
Carfilzomib suppresses the proliferation of
breast cancer cells
To assess the anti-tumor effect of CFZ on breast
cancer cells, seven breast cancer cell lines, including
MCF7, T-47D, MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, MDAMB-468, MDA-MB-231, and BT-549 were used, which
together represent the major molecular subtypes of
breast cancer (Table 1) [17–19]. These cells were treated
with CFZ at the indicated concentrations of 0.001 μM
to 50 μM for 72 h, then subjected to an MTT assay.
The results showed that carfilzomib reduced the cell
viability of all types of tested breast cancer cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). The IC50s of CFZ
were between 6.34 nM (MDA-MB-361) and 76.51 nM
(T-47D) (Figure 1). The cytotoxic effect of CFZ was
confirmed by morphological changes of the cells after
treatment for 72 h (Supplementary Figure S1a). Since
the IC50s were around the doses of 0.01 μM and 0.05
μM within all cell lines, we only showed the data for
these two doses.
To further validate the inhibitory effect of CFZ
on cell proliferation, a cellular colony formation assay
was performed. The cells were treated with CFZ at
the concentrations of 0 μM, 0.005 μM and 0.01 μM
for 72 h and then cultured in drug-free medium for
about two weeks. Carfilzomib treatment remarkably
inhibited the cellular proliferation compared to the
control groups  (Supplementary Figure S1b). These
data indicate that CFZ has a potent inhibitory effect on
the proliferation of breast cancer cells, regardless of
molecular subtypes.

Carfilzomib restrains the anchorageindependent growth of breast cancer cells
Cancer cells possess the ability to grow into ballshaped colonies in a three dimensional space when
cultured in soft agar. To evaluate whether carfilzomib
could impair the anchorage-independent growth ability
of breast cancer cells, soft agar assays were performed.
Here, breast cancer cells, including MCF7, T-47D, MDAMB-361, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and BT-549,
were cultured with CFZ at 0 μM, 0.005 μM and 0.01
μM for three weeks. After that, the visible colonies were
fixed and stained. The anchorage-independent growth
ability of HCC1954 cell line was too weak to form visible
colonies in soft agar, so the data for this cell line is not
shown. The number of colonies decreased in CFZ-treated
groups compared to the control cells in the tested cell
lines (Figure 2a). The inhibitory effects of CFZ on colony

μM of carfilzomib for 72 h, and the cell proliferation was
assessed by MTT assay. Cytotoxic effects of 0.01 μM of
carfilzomib alone on MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cell lines
were very strong, so we used 0.005 μM of carfilzomib as
the alternative. The results showed that the cell viabilities
were much lower when treated with the combination
compared to those treated with DOX alone (Figure 4a4g). The combination indexes (CIs) for most combinations
were far lower than 1.0, indicating synergistic effects on
breast cancer cells (Figure 4a-4g). It implies that CFZ
could sensitize the cytotoxicity of DOX on the tested cell
lines.

Carfilzomib induces apoptosis in breast
cancer cells
It has been reported that CFZ can induce apoptosis
in a variety of tumor types, including lung cancer,
melanoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [11, 20,
21]. To examine whether CFZ could induce apoptosis
in human breast cancer cells, the cells were treated with
CFZ at concentrations of 0, 0.01 μM, 0.05 μM, 0.1 μM
and 1 μM, respectively, and then harvested and subjected
to immunoblotting. Since MCF7 cells are Caspase 3
deficient, we tested Caspase 7 as the alternative. We found
that CFZ could induce the cleavage of PARP and Caspase
3 (or Caspase 7) in the tested cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner except MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-468 and MDAMB-231 cell lines (Figure 3a-3g). To further verify that
carfilzomib could induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-361,
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the cells
were treated with CFZ at concentrations of 0, 0.05 μM,
and 1 μM, respectively, and then harvested and subjected
to flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a-S2c). The
results showed that CFZ could induce apoptosis in the
tested cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether,
the results suggest that carfilzomib alone could trigger
apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

Carfilzomib enhances the DOX-induced
apoptosis in breast cancer cells
To explore whether CFZ could strengthen DOXinduced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, the cells were
treated with DOX alone (1 μM) or combined with
carfilzomib at 0.05 μM (lower dose) for 0, 16 h, or 24
h. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that CFZ could
boost DOX-induced PARP and Caspase 3 (or Caspase 7)
cleavage in all subtypes of breast cancer cell lines tested
(Figure 5a-5g). This indicates that CFZ could intensify
DOX-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

Activation of JNK, but not p38 MAPK, and
inactivation of NF-κB is required for carfilzomib

cancer cells

Carfilzomib intensifies the cytotoxic effect of
DOX on breast cancer cells

Both NF-κB and MAPK are key signal transduction
pathways in regulating cell survival [21–24]. Studies
have revealed that DOX could induce NF-κB and MAPK
activation [16, 25, 26]; meanwhile proteasome inhibitors
could inhibit the activation of NF-κB [27]. To better

effects on breast cancer cells, the cells were cultured in the

that CFZ reinforced DOX-induced SAPK/JNK and p38
MAPK phosphorylation, whereas it inhibited DOXinduced NF-κB activation.
To investigate which pathway contributes to
the enhanced effects of carfilzomib on DOX-induced
apoptosis in breast cancer cells, we used specific inhibitors
to individually block NF-κB or MAPK pathways. The
human estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive MCF7
is a well-established and widely used model system of
breast cancer cells. We then examined the impact of the
specific inhibitors on the proliferation of MCF7 cells. The
results of MTT showed that the JNK-specific inhibitor
SP600125, not p38 inhibitor SB203580, protected MCF7
from the enhanced effect of carfilzomib on DOX-induced
cytotoxicity, and IκB kinase (IKK) inhibitor, PS-1145

contributed to the enhanced effect of carfilzomib on DOXinduced cytotoxicity (Figure 7a). In order to assess the
ability of SP600125 and PS-1145 to block JNK and NFκB pathways, we performed Western blotting analysis in
MCF7 cell line. As expected, carfilzomib in combination
with DOX- induced strong phosphorylation of c-Jun and
JNK was significantly blocked, and IκBα degradation
was blocked when cells were coincubated with SP600125
or PS-1145 (Figure 7b). Furthermore, SP600125 caused
significant reduction of carfilzomib in combination
with DOX-induced Caspase 7 cleavage, and PS-1145
enhanced  to carfilzomib in combination with DOXinduced Caspase 7 cleavage (Figure 7c). Collectively,
these studies provide evidence that carfilzomib could
boost DOX-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells

by activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic pathway and
inhibition of NF-κB.

Increasingly, clinicians are challenged with
resistance and toxicity to monotherapy or even in
combination therapy. It is reported that DOX induces
NF-κB activation and gives rise to DOX resistance in
breast cancer and uterine cervical carcinoma [16, 30].
NF-κB activity has been implicated in several aspects of
oncogenesis and chemoresistance [31, 32]. These include
its ability to induce transcription of genes associated
with proliferation and survival, such as cyclin D1,
c-IAP-2 and Bcl-xL [33, 34]. Chemoresistance caused
by NF-κB activation is a common off-target effect
and often necessitates discontinuation of therapy. For
these reasons, in recent years, there has been a growing
interest aiming at inhibiting NF-κB activity in cancer
cells. In addition, DOX also induces the activation of
p38 MAPK and JNK apoptosis signaling in breast cancer
cells [35]. Combinations of proteasome inhibitors and
other chemotherapeutic agents have been examined for
use in cancer therapy. In imatinib-sensitive and -resistant
chronic myeloid leukemia models, CFZ showed a
synergistic effect in combination with tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [36]. Dual drug-loaded liposomes containing
CFZ and DOX exhibited synergistic efficacy in multiple
myeloma in vitro and were more efficacious in inhibiting
tumor growth in vivo [37]. As shown, CIs for most
combinations of CFZ and DOX were far lower than 1.0,
indicating synergistic effects on breast cancer cells, and
the combination of the lower doses of CFZ and DOX
significantly and synergistically induced increasingly
cytotoxic effects and apoptosis in breast cancer cells by
preventing inhibitory factor κB αlpha (IκBα) degradation
in the NF-κB signal pathway and activating JNK apoptosis
signaling not p38 MAPK in our assays. These data
support a model described in Figure 8. It demonstrated

DISCUSSION
The clinical success of the first-generation PI
Bortezomib as an anticancer therapy for multiple myeloma
and relapsed mantle cell lymphoma [28] has bolstered
interest in the development of new generations of PIs, such
as CFZ and NPI-0052. Development of PIs with distinct
substrate selectivity, improved bioavailability and lower
toxicity may open the door to widespread usage in solid
tumors. Here, we examined the antitumor effect of CFZ on
the proliferation of breast cancer cells. We found that CFZ
has a high cytotoxic activity, accompanied with reduced
cellular proliferation, attenuated colony forming ability, and
increased apoptosis in a diverse panel of breast cancer cell
lines representing all major molecular subtypes of breast
cancers. IC50 values for the tested cell lines treated with
CFZ were all in the low nanomolar range from 6.34 nM
(MDA-MB-361) to 76.51 nM (T-47D), there was more than
10-fold difference. This is similar to the reported CFZ IC50
values (0.2 nM -99.4 nM) in other solid tumor cell lines [11,
12], and it implies that the different subtypes of breast cancer
cell lines might show the sensitivity difference to CFZ. It’s
worth mentioning that the anchorage-independent growth
ability of HCC1954 was too poor to form macroscopic
colonies in soft agar. These data suggest that CFZ alone
could effectively restrain proteasome activity and has a
significant antitumor effect on the tested breast cancer cells.
Similarly, studies with CFZ have demonstrated that CFZ
causes diminished cell proliferation and increased cell death
across a variety of cancer cell lines such as those from lung
cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer [11, 12, 29].

that though breast cancer cells showed higher sensitivity
to CFZ, breast cancer cells were further sensitized by
the combination of CFZ with DOX treatment. CFZ may
sensitize breast cancer cells to DOX chemotherapy and
thus lessen DOX resistance and toxicity. In kind, some
reports suggest that proteasome inhibitors exacerbated
DOX-induced cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes [38] and
sensitized leukemia cells and breast cancer cells to DOX
by suppressing NF-κB and activating JNK apoptosis
signaling pathway [39, 40].
A study that combined treatment of bortezomib and
Lapatinib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and HER2 tyrosine kinases, showed a synergistic
effect in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells [41]. In
our work, carfilzomib alone or in combination with DOX
showed potent cytotoxic effects and induced apoptosis
in HER2-positive MDA-MB-361 and HCC1954 breast
cancer cells. CFZ may also be combined with inhibitors
to other receptor tyrosine kinases to increase therapeutic
efficacy for breast cancer patients. Another paper reported
that Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and GSH are upregulated in bortezomib-resistant neuroblastoma [42]. In
future studies, the use of PIs and the development of novel
strategies to combat cancer that inhibit multiple targets
may be indispensable in order to model better treatment
options for breast cancer patients.
In conclusion, by using a panel of breast cancer
cell lines, we provided compelling evidence that
carfilzomib alone could suppress the proliferation and
induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells and enhance the
cytotoxic effect of DOX and DOX-induced apoptosis in
combination by preventing IκBα degradation in the NFκB signal pathway and activating JNK apoptotic signaling.
This study suggests that carfilzomib might serve as an
effective drug in the potential combination therapy for
breast cancer patients with chemoresistance.

was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas,
TX, USA). DOX (D1515) was obtained from SigmaAldrich. Carfilzomib (C3022) was purchased from LC Lab
(Woburn, MA, USA).

Cytotoxicity assay
Cell cytotoxicity assays were performed using
MTT (MKBH9792V) (Sigma-Aldrich, Spring, TX, USA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the density of 5 ×
103 cells per well. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, cells
were either allowed to grow in media alone or in media
containing increasing concentrations of carfilzomib, DOX,
or the combination of the two agents. 72 hours later, cells
were observed and photographed by optical microscope.
10 μl of MTT was added into each well, and the cells were
incubated for another 2 h. Then, 50μl of DMSO was added
into each well, and the cells were incubated for another 10
min. The absorbance of each well was measured at 540 nm
and plotted for the cell viability curve. Each experiment
was performed in triplicates.

Determination of synergy
Cells were seeded in triplicate (5 × 103/well) in
96-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. The
cells were then treated for 72 h with varying doses of
individual drugs alone or varying doses of non-constant
ratio of two drugs together. Untreatment was used as a
control. Following performance of MTT assays, data were
analyzed and combination indexes (CIs) were determined
according to the method of Chou and Talalay [43] using
CalcuSyn V2.0 software (BIOSOFT). CI values lower
than 1.0 were considered evidence of synergism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, T47D,
MDA-MB-361, HCC1954, MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-231, and BT-549 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
MCF7, MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), and T-47D,
HCC1954, MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 were maintained
in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza), all supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.
St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100
mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 2 × 103 cells
per well. 48 or 72 hours later, cells were incubated with
carfilzomib at 0, 0.005 μM, or 0.01 μM for 72 h, and then
cultured in drug-free medium for about two weeks. After
that, cells were fixed and stained with methanol/crystal
violet for 10 min and photographed. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate.

to PI staining. Unstained cells were used as a negative
control and untreated cells were used as a control for
treated cells. Then analysis was performed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACDiva
software v. 6.0.

Cell anchorage-independent growth ability was
assessed by soft agar assay. In a 6-well plate, the bottom
layer was made of 0.5% agar, 2 ml in each well, cooled
to semi-solid. For the top layer, cells were mixed with
0.3% agar, 1.5 ml in each well at the density of 5 × 103
cells per well, mixed with carfilzomib at concentrations
of 0, 0.005 μM, or 0.01 μM. Cells grew at 37°C for
three weeks until the colonies were visible to the naked
eye, were stained with crystal violet for 2 h and were
photographed. The colonies were counted by Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA,
USA) and plotted. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 5 software. All values were presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). P-values <0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant. Student’s t-test (two-tailed)
or ANOVA (Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-test) were
used to analyze the difference between the drug treatment
groups and control group.

Immunoblotting

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

For immunoblotting, after each treatment, cells
were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and spun down.
The cell pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer for 30 min
at 4°C [50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM
benzamidine, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 10 mM sodium fluoride (NaF), 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate (OV), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
2 and 3 (p5726 and p0044, Sigma-Aldrich)]. The
solutions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min,
and the supernatants were collected as cell lysates. The
cell lysates were subjected to 10% or 15% SDS–PAGE
electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes, followed by immunoblotting with
the primary antibodies and the horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse
IgG. The membranes were developed using the ECL
Western blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

The experiment was performed as the following.
Breast cancer cell lines were seeded in 6 cm dishes and
treated with carfilzomib of 0, 0.05 μM, or 1 μM for 24
h. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in the medium
with 10% FBS, and centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 min
at 4°C. Cells were then washed with PBS for three
times, resuspended in 200 μl of PI staining solution
(51-66211E; BD Biosciences), and then transferred into
new 5 ml culture tubes with filter. The tubes were gently
vortexed and incubated for 15 min at RT (25°C) in the
dark, then the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
within 1 h. As viable cells with intact membranes resist
PI staining, only the membranes of dead cells are subject
