Abstract:
Epigenetic inactivation of tumor-suppressor and other regulatory genes plays a
critical role in carcinogenesis. Transcriptional silencing is often maintained by DNA
methyl transferase (DNMT)-mediated hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter
DNA. Nucleoside analogs including azacytidine and decitabine have been used to
inhibit DNMT and re-activate genes, and are clinically used. Their shortcomings include
a short half-life and a slow onset of action due to required nucleotide incorporation
during DNA replication, which may limit clinical utility. It might be useful to begin to
identify lead compounds having novel properties, specifically distinct and fast-acting
gene desilencing. We previously identified chemicals augmenting gene expression
in multiple reporter systems. We now report that a subset of these compounds
that includes quinacrine re-expresses epigenetically silenced genes implicated in
carcinogenesis. p16, TFPI2, the cadherins E-cadherin and CDH13, and the secreted
frizzle-related proteins (SFRPs) SFRP1 and SFRP5 were desilenced in cancer cell lines.
These lead compounds were fast-acting: re-expression occurred by 12-24 hours. Reactivation of silenced genes was accompanied by depletion of DNMT1 at the promoters
of activated genes and demethylation of DNA. A model compound, 5175328, induced
changes more rapidly than decitabine. These gene desilencing agents belonged to
a class of acridine compounds, intercalated into DNA, and inhibited DNMT1 activity
in vitro. Although to define the mechanism would be outside the scope of this initial
report, this class may re-activate silenced genes in part by intercalating into DNA
and subsequently inhibiting full DNMT1 activity. Rapid mechanisms for chemical
desilencing of methylated genes therefore exist.

Introduction

and ADP-ribosylation [2, 3]. These modifications are
individually associated with gene activation or repression
and are collectively known as the histone code. Because
epigenetic changes are potentially reversible, they provide
attractive targets for cancer therapy. Reprogramming
of epigenetic controls is also an emerging strategy for
in vitro development of stem cells and for generating
therapeutically useful differentiated cell types [4].
Demethylating agents currently in use, e.g. azacytidine
and decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine), are nucleoside
analogs. They demethylate promoter DNA slowly because

Genes silenced in cancer comprise tumorsuppressor genes, regulatory genes, and genes involved
in differentiation. These genes are often inactivated by
epigenetic mechanisms involving methylation of cytosines
in CpG islands of promoter DNA, higher-order heritable
chromatin folding/remodeling, and modifications on
histone proteins 3 and 4 [1]. Histone tail modifications
include acetylation, phosphorylation, lysine or arginine
methylation, ubiquitylation, glycosylation, sumoylation,

they require incorporation into DNA during cell division
and subsequent depletion of DNA methyl transferases
(DNMTs) through irreversible binding of these proteins
[5]. Their limited efficacy in culture and in treating solid
tumors has, however, partially been addressed by cotreatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
such as trichostatin A (TSA) [6].
When exploring compounds for therapeutic
functions, the identification of novel properties in lead
compounds is an endeavor preceding the subsequent
optimization to create a drug. Because the identified lead

compounds initially tend to have toxicity/off-target effects
and relatively low potency and efficacy, optimization can
be a long and expensive process. These two endeavors are
discrete. Here, we provide lead compounds so as to begin
to explore new properties by which gene desilencing can
be accomplished.
From high-throughput cell-based screening,
we previously identified eleven compounds that
nonspecifically elevated the activity of multiple reporter
systems tested [7]. Quinacrine, 1-phenyl-3-(2-thiazolyl)-2thiourea, piperine, apigenin, and ChemBridge compounds
5100018, 5110235, 5175323, 5175324, 5175328,
5234881, and 5238219 indiscriminately activated gene
expression. The activation property was shared among
more than one of the following seven reporter systems:
Smad4R, RKO p53R, HCT116 p53R, DLD/BFP, CHOAA8, Shh FF, and Shh REN. Of the eleven agents listed
above, four are structurally similar acridine compounds:
5175323, 5175324, 5175328, and quinacrine. These
four share a hetero-tri-cyclic functional group known
to intercalate into DNA [8] and produced the greatest
induction of the reporter systems studied [7]. We therefore
set out to determine whether these compounds could be
used in cancer cell lines to re-activate methylated and
silenced genes that had been implicated in carcinogenesis.
We found that acridine compounds could rapidly desilence
genes without any apparent requirement for incorporation
into DNA. We thus identified a class of lead compounds
with novel useful properties which could be optimized in
the future for anticancer effects and reprogramming of
gene expression.

To extend our prior results [7], CHO AA8-Luc
Tet-Off cells were plated and quadruplicate wells treated
with each chemical at each of various concentrations for
18 hours. In these cells, luciferase expression is driven
by the constitutively active cytomegalovirus (CMV)
promoter. Therefore, luciferase assays were used to
measure the effect of treatment on nonspecific gene
expression. 5175324 could not be tested because it was not
readily available. Five chemicals produced highly robust
induction (greater than 10-fold) of the reporter system,
indicating indiscriminate elevation of gene expression:
TSA, Scriptaid, 5175323, 5175328, and quinacrine. The
greatest reporter activity was seen using 0.5 – 5 µg/ml for
TSA, 2 – 10 µg/ml for Scriptaid, 2 µg/ml for 5175323, 1
– 2 µg/ml for 5175328 (all replicated multiple times with
similar findings), and 5 µg/ml for quinacrine (replicated
with similar findings). Lesser induction (less than 10-

5234881, and 5238219. These findings were consistent
with prior work [7].
Of the five chemicals causing significant induction,
TSA and Scriptaid are well established as histone
deacetylase inhibitors [9]. The rest belong to the same
class of acridine compounds (Table 1). Intrigued by their
strong ability to nonspecifically enhance gene expression,
we decided to study these compounds (5175323, 5175328,
and quinacrine) in greater detail and used dose-response
curves to determine the desired range of concentrations for
further studies (Fig. 1).

with similar results). 5175328 (Fig. 3) re-expressed
CDH13, E-cadherin, SFRP1, and TFPI2 in MiaPaCa2
cells (replicated multiple times with similar findings), but
it did not re-activate BNIP3 in the same cells. Similarly,
5175328 (Fig. 2E) desilenced SFRP1 and SFRP5 in
RKO cells (replicated with similar observations), but did
not re-activate p16 in the same cells. Finally, 5175328
(Fig. 2F) re-expressed SFRP1, SFRP5, and TFPI2 in
HCT-116 (colorectal) cells (replicated with similar
findings). Sporadic failures to re-express were seen
occasionally (Fig. 2C), but re-expression was observed
over a continuous range of drug concentration in other
experiments. We thus showed that acridine compounds
desilenced genes in cancer cells (Table 2).

Attempts to re-activate specific methylated and
silenced genes in cancer cell lines

Specificity: Chemotherapeutic agents do not have
a general ability to cause gene re-expression

In an attempt to re-express specific methylationsilenced genes, we treated several randomly chosen cancer
cell lines with various concentrations of each acridine
compound for 24 hours. We found that 5175323 (Fig.
2A) and quinacrine (Fig. 2C) both re-expressed CDH13,
E-cadherin, SFRP1, and TFPI2 in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic
cells (replicated with similar findings). 5175323 (Fig.
2B) and quinacrine (Fig. 2D) also re-activated p16,

To address the possibility that gene desilencing
was simply a consequence of toxicity or DNA damage,
we tested several chemotherapeutic drugs for their ability
to induce reporter activity in CHO AA8-Luc Tet-Off
cells or desilence genes in MiaPaCa2 cells. Etoposide,

caused moderate to negligible induction of the reporter
system (less than 10-fold induction) in CHO AA8-Luc
Tet-Off cells (Etoposide: 4.5-8.3 fold, 5-fluorouracil (5FU): 2.4 fold, mitomycin C: 1.5 fold, and quercetin: 1.3
fold). Also, none of these drugs re-activated E-cadherin,
SFRP1, or TFPI2 in MiaPaCa2 cells. We concluded that
DNA-damaging agents had little ability to enhance gene
expression specifically or nonspecifically.

early as 12 hours after treatment (Fig. 3). The level of reexpression diminished at 48 hours after treatment (Fig. 3).

Preliminary mechanistic explorations
The focus of these studies was to identify genedesilencing agents having novel properties, described
above. Although outside the fundamental scope of a
report of lead compounds, we also performed limited
mechanistic explorations that could help explain the
class of compounds indentified and orient future research
into optimized compounds. It is these later-generation
compounds, which would reflect optimization for potency,
specificity, and efficacy, that would provide the most
suitable agents for defining mechanisms of action. With
these caveats, the results of brief mechanistic explorations
of the lead compounds are provided below.

Rapid onset of effect
Next, we determined the time-course of gene reactivation by 5175328 (our model acridine compound) in
MiaPaCa2 cells. We did not see any gene re-expression
after 6 hours of treatment. However, 5175328 induced reexpression of CDH13, E-cadherin, SFRP1, and TFPI2 as

fashion. Cells were treated with an acridine compound for 24 hours or with decitabine for 48 hours with drug and medium replaced 24

control. A, Compound 5175323 induced gene re-expression in MiaPaCa2 cells. Re-expressed genes: CDH13, E-cadherin, SFRP1, and

by a degree of rapid promoter demethylation for the
majority of genes tested.
We thus wondered whether 5175328 affected global
DNMT1 protein quantity, as was observed following
treatment of cells with decitabine or azacytidine [16]. We
evaluated the effects of 5175328 on DNMT1 protein level
and histone acetylation in MiaPaCa2 cells by western
blot (replicated with similar observations). TSA-treated
MiaPaCa2 cells served as a positive control for histone
acetylation (Fig. 4C). We found that the amount of
DNMT1 protein decreased in MiaPaCa2 cells after higherdose 5175328 treatment at 12 hours and 24 hours (Fig. 4C).
Interpretation of this finding was, however, complicated
by the observation that etoposide and mitomycin C also
reduced global DNMT1 protein level in MiaPaCa2 cells
without inducing re-expression of methylation-silenced
genes. This suggests that depletion of DNMT1 at a global
level might not always lead to gene desilencing and may
be secondary to inhibition of proliferation, proliferation
being associated with DNMT1 expression. We observed
a decrease in global histone acetylation after treatment of
MiaPaCa2 cells with 5175328 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
inhibition of histone deacetylases was unlikely to be its
mechanism of action as this would increase global histone
acetylation.
Next, we sought to determine the effect of 5175328
on the localization of DNMT1 to specific re-activated
promoters, using the chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay (each experiment performed twice with
similar findings and PCRs performed in triplicate for
each experiment). We saw a decrease in the amount of
DNMT1 associated with specific promoters after treatment
of MiaPaCa2 cells with 5175328 for 24 hours (Fig. 4D).
For example, 5175328 reduced the level of DNMT1 at
CDH13, E-cadherin, and SFRP1 promoters (Fig. 4D).
A similar pattern of DNMT1 localization was observed
at a second site in the SFRP1 promoter. Consistent with
the failure to detect any change in demethylation at the
TFPI2 promoter, the amount of DNMT1 localized to this
promoter did not decrease with 5175328 treatment. Also,
in accordance with the pattern of TFPI2 re-expression,
the level of histone acetylation peaked after low-dose
5175328 treatment and declined at a higher dose. There
was a decrease in the amount of histone acetylation at

In an effort to explore possible modes of action,
we used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to examine the
methylation status of re-activated promoters after 5175328
treatment since previous studies had established DNA
methylation as a mechanism for silencing these genes
[10-15]. 5175328 induced dose- and time-dependent
demethylation of CDH13, E-cadherin, and SFRP1
promoters in MiaPaCa2 cells. This process began by 6
hours at the CDH13 promoter, 12 hours at the SFRP1
promoter, and 18 hours at the E-cadherin promoter (Fig.
4A). It peaked around 24 hours in all three promoters (Fig.
4A). Evidence for 5175328-dependent demethylation was
ambiguous at the desilenced TFPI2 promoter in MiaPaCa2
cells since this gene was only partially methylated prior
to treatment. 5175328 consistently induced these changes
more rapidly and robustly than decitabine (Fig. 4A). The
evidence also suggested dose-dependent demethylation
of the SFRP1 promoter in RKO cells after 24 hours of
5175328 treatment (Fig. 4B). However, we could not
detect 5175328-mediated demethylation at the re-activated
SFRP5 promoter in RKO cells, which was also partially
methylated at baseline. Consistent with the failure of
5175328 to re-activate p16 in RKO cells, we did not see
evidence for demethylation of the p16 promoter in the
same cells. It is conceivable that 5175328 re-activated
some genes by alternative mechanisms or that baseline
incomplete methylation made detection of small degrees
of demethylation challenging.
5175328-induced demethylation of the SFRP1
promoter was confirmed to affect CpG dinucleotides
by bisulfite sequencing in RKO and MiaPaCa2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). We analyzed 58 CpG sites
from the SFRP1 promoter in both cell lines. The average
number of demethylated CpG sites per DNA molecule
increased after treatment with 5175328. Patches of
adjacent demethylated CpG dinucleotides also were
observed after treatment. Considering the methylationspecific PCR results and the pattern observed using
bisulfite sequencing, 5175328-mediated re-expression of
methylation-silenced genes appeared to be accompanied

CDH13 and SFRP1 promoters (Fig. 4D). The pattern
of histone acetylation was similar at a second site in the
SFRP1 promoter. At the E-cadherin promoter, 5175328
treatment increased the level of histone acetylation at a
low dose (correlating with gene re-expression in Fig. 3)
and decreased it at a higher dose (Fig. 4D). In summary,
5175328 induced depletion of DNMT1 at specific
desilenced promoters, undergoing demethylation. The
effect on histone acetylation was variable.

ethidium bromide (Fig. 5B). Higher concentrations of
5175328 resulted in greater retardation, while the effect
of ethidium bromide reached a maximum (Fig. 5B).
5175323 at 500 µg/ml and quinacrine at 50 µg/ml induced
retardation similar to 5 µg/ml ethidium bromide (Fig.
5B). We concluded that acridine compounds could swiftly
intercalate into DNA in a dose-dependent manner.

Acridine compounds intercalate into DNA and
inhibit DNMT1 activity in vitro

Our findings suggested that specific acridine
compounds rapidly re-activate expression of methylated
and silenced genes at µg/ml concentrations (5175328: 0.5
– 5 µg/ml, 5175323: 1 - 5 µg/ml, and quinacrine: 2 – 20
µg/ml). A possible mechanism would be the demethylation
of promoter CpG islands due to intercalation of the
compound into DNA and subsequent inhibition and
depletion of DNMT1 at the desilenced promoter. Other, not
yet explored, mechanisms might also be involved, and the
process of demethylation may be complex. For example,
increasing concentrations of a model acridine compound
lead to progressive DNA demethylation and DNMT1
depletion at specific promoters, but gene re-expression
was lost beyond an optimal concentration. These higher
concentrations were also associated with growth arrest.
Since inhibition and depletion of DNMT1 would result
in demethylation only if cell division occurred (passive
demethylation), progressive demethylation in the absence
of cell proliferation would suggest a possible role for nonpassive modes of DNA demethylation. Another intriguing
observation was the absence of DNMT1 depletion or any
detectable change in DNA methylation at the re-activated
TFPI2 promoter, allowing for alternative mechanisms of
gene desilencing.
Coincidentally, 5175328, a model intercalating
agent, is also a highly selective α2C-adrenoceptor
antagonist at low nM concentrations with anti-depressant
and antipsychotic properties [17]. Some of the observed

Discussion

Because 5175328 treatment led to the appearance
of demethylated promoter DNA, we inquired whether it
could directly inhibit DNMT1 in vitro. We assayed the
ability of DNMT1 to methylate a DNA substrate in the
presence of various concentrations of 5175328, 5175323,
and quinacrine (each experiment replicated multiple times
with similar findings and assays performed in duplicate for
each experiment). Increasing concentrations of 5175328,
5175323, and quinacrine reduced DNMT1 activity (Fig.
5A). 5-fluorouracil, a negative control, had no effect on
DNMT1 activity (Fig. 5A). Acridine compounds thus
inhibited DNMT1 activity in vitro in a dose-dependent
manner.
To explore a potential mechanism by which
acridine compounds might inhibit the DNA-interacting
enzyme DNMT1, we assayed DNA intercalation in vitro
(replicated with similar results). Briefly, closed, circular
plasmid DNA was incubated with each compound for 5
minutes. Ethidium bromide was used as a positive control.
5238219 lacking the hetero-tri-cyclic acridine ring, served
as a negative control (Fig. 5B). Increasing concentrations
of 5175328, 5175323, and quinacrine retarded the
migration of plasmid DNA (Fig. 5B). 5175328 at 5 µg/
ml caused the same degree of retardation as 5 µg/ml

pharmacologic properties of 5175328 at higher doses,
however, might include its ability to affect gene
expression.
Quinacrine is known to act as a potent inhibitor of
histamine N-methyl transferase [18]. It is also reported to
have anticancer activity at µM concentrations, synergizing
with 5-fluorouracil in inducing apoptosis of colorectal
cancer cells [19], rendering hepatocellular carcinoma

cells susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [20], and
enhancing toxicity of other chemotherapeutic agents [20].
The mechanisms for these effects are unknown. Our results
suggest a new possible mechanism, for quinacrine might
exert some of its anticancer effects in part by inhibiting
another methyl transferase DNMT1 and affecting DNA
methylation, which could alter the expression of genes
affecting the sensitivities to other chemotherapies.

Nucleoside DNMT inhibitors such as azacytidine,
decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine), SG-110 (decitabine
prodrug), 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine, and zebularine have
been used effectively to inhibit DNA methyl transferase
and re-express silenced genes. Azacytidine and
decitabine have been approved for use in the treatment
of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but have properties
that may limit their use. They may mutagenize due to
DNA strand breaks [5, 21]. They have a short half-life
in vivo, and yet require at least 48 hours of treatment in
culture even for low-level gene re-activation [6]. Their use
is characterized by a slow onset of the demethylated state
because they require covalent incorporation into DNA
during an initial cell division, prior to any inhibition of
DNMTs during a subsequent cell division [5]. Thus, at
least three cell divisions are required for demethylation
of both strands of DNA to be accomplished. To provide
a more efficient reversal of gene silencing, HDAC
inhibitors including SAHA (Vorinostat), Belinostat,

Entinostat, TSA, Panobinostat, phenyl butyrate, sodium
butyrate, valproic acid, Scriptaid, and Romidepsin have
been used in conjunction with azacytidine and decitabine
[22]. However, HDAC inhibitors cannot be used alone
to desilence methylated genes [6]. Polyamine LSD1 (a
protein lysine demethylase) inhibitors have also been
used to re-express genes, but they were found to be less
effective than decitabine [23]. Among histone-lysinemethyl transferase inhibitors, EZH2 inhibitors like
3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) and Sinefungin and G9a
(EHMT2) inhibitors like BIX-01294 and 8 (UNC0224)
[24] have been used for gene desilencing. Several classes
of topoisomerase inhibitors re-activate the dormant
allele of Ube3a in neurons [25]. These classes include
camptothecin derivatives, indenoisoquinoline derivatives,
bis-dioxopiperazine derivatives, the podophyllotoxin
derivative etoposide, and the aminoacridine derivative
amsacrine [25]. DNA intercalation might plausibly be
involved in their desilencing effect, based upon the

Compounds and drugs

observations in this manuscript.
Considerable effort has gone into developing
putative non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors as gene
desilencing agents. Examples include flavonoids like
(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from green tea
[26], genistein from soybean [27] [28], quercetin [29],
the thiopurine 6-thioguanine [30], disulfiram [21],
mitoxantrone [31], psammaplin A [32], hydralazine [33]
[34], procainamide [33] [34], procaine [35], N-acetylprocainamide [36], arsenic trioxide [37], SGI-1027
[38], RG108 [39], and the phosphorothioate antisense
oligonucleotide MG98 [40] [41] [42]. Of these, MG98
was abandoned after failure in clinical trials [43] [44]. In
subsequent studies, EGCG [45] [46], hydralazine [45],
procaine [46], and procainamide [45] were found to have
insignificant demethylating activity. RG108 was less
effective than azacytidine or decitabine, but comparable
to zebularine [46].
A general consensus is that decitabine and
azacytidine remain the most potent DNMT inhibitors,
superior to other compounds tested [45-47]. Acridine
compounds might yet offer some advantages over
decitabine and azacytidine as novel non-nucleoside
inhibitors of DNMT1 and gene desilencing agents.
As a class, they are known to rapidly intercalate into
DNA [8]. DNA intercalation by these compounds
might mediate DNMT1 inhibition as well as other, not
yet identified rapid biochemical events such as active
DNA demethylation. Decitabine or azacytidine inhibits
DNMT only after covalent incorporation into DNA,
this inhibition thus requiring at least two rounds of cell
division. Since acridine compounds would not require
covalent incorporation into DNA for their activity,
demethylation could be observed by methylation-specific
PCR after only one round of cell division, as early as 6-12
hours after treatment in vitro. Our study thus identifies a
promising class of lead compounds for development of
gene-desilencing mehods and reprogramming of gene
expression. Among other properties, these compounds
are novel, fast-acting, non-nucleoside gene-desilencing
agents, and optimized class members might be used to
restore expression of epigenetically silenced genes in
cancer cells.

Compounds 5100018, 5175323, 5175328, 5234881,
and 5238219 were obtained from ChemBridge. 5-Aza2’-deoxycytidine (decitabine), etoposide, 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), mitomycin C, quercetin, quinacrine, Scriptaid
[7, 9], and TSA were from Sigma. Ethidium bromide was
from Fisher Biotech. Compounds 5175323, 5175328, and
quinacrine are further described in Table 1.

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter assay was performed with the
Promega Firefly Luciferase Assay System according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were plated
in quadruplicate, incubated with each compound for 18
hours, and then lysed for luciferase assay. We used the
PerkinElmer Microbeta Trilux plate reader to measure
luminescence.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from cell populations
using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and subjected to
DNAse I (Invitrogen) digestion to remove contaminating
DNA. 1 µg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20 µl
volume (SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System,
Invitrogen). In a parallel tube, 1 µg of RNA was treated
with the cDNA synthesis reagents without the reverse
transcriptase (RT) enzyme in a 20 µl volume (the “no RT
control”). 1 µl of the cDNA mixture or “no RT control”
was subjected to PCR amplification for 35 cycles to
evaluate expression of genes of interest. Primer sequences
used in RT-PCR reactions and corresponding annealing
temperatures are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
Genomic DNA was extracted from cell populations
(Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini Kit). EZ DNA Methylation Kit
(Zymo Research) was used for bisulfite treatment of DNA.
To determine the methylation status of promoter regions,
each sample of bisulfite-modified DNA was subjected to
35 cycles of PCR amplification with an annealing temp of
60⁰ C using one primer pair specific for methylated DNA
and another pair for unmethylated DNA. Primers used for
MSP reactions are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
MiaPaCa2 (from ATCC), HCT116 (ATCC), RKO
(ATCC), and CHO AA8-Luc Tet-Off (Clontech) cells were
grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin.
The CHO AA8-Luc Tet-Off cell line was additionally
supplemented with 100 µg/ml G418.

CTNNA1-BSeq-reverse,
5′-TCCTACCRCAAACTTCCAAAAACCT-3’ with an
annealing temp of 60⁰ C. This amplified a 429 bp region of
the CpG island, containing 59 CpG sites. PCR products
were separated from reagents using PCR cleanup and
cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Plasmids from single colonies were purified using
QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and were sequenced
with M13 reverse primers. All CpG sites (58) from the
amplicon (excluding primer sequences) were analyzed.

(Bio-Rad iCycler) was performed to determine the relative
abundance of the promoter DNA sequence associated
with the protein of interest. Primers used for ChIP realtime quantitative PCRs and corresponding annealing
temperatures are provided in Supplementary Table S3.

Assay for DNMT activity
Recombinant DNMT1 was obtained from Active
Motif. The DNMT activity assay was performed using
the EpiQuik DNMT Activity Assay Ultra Kit (Epigentek)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Assay for DNA intercalation

To prepare whole-cell extracts, cells were lysed
by rocking in a detergent (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for an hour at 4⁰C and clarified
by centrifugation. The supernatant was recovered as a
whole-cell extract. To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were
lysed by gentle hypotonic treatment (10 mM HEPES
pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP40, and protease inhibitor) and gently centrifuged. The
supernatant was removed as the cytoplasmic extract. The
nuclear pellet was resuspended (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150
mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease
inhibitor). The protein concentration was determined by
the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). After adding a denaturant
(2% (m/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) , 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 0.002% (m/v) bromophenol blue, 2 mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris pH 6.8, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol),
samples were boiled and resolved on a NuPAGE 4-12%
Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to
a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Pierce).
Blots were incubated with primary antibodies: antiDNMT1 (Sigma), anti-actin (Santa Cruz), or anti-acetyl
histone3 lysine9 (Millipore), followed by horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz): anti-rabbit IgG, anti-goat IgG, or anti-mouse IgG.
Membranes were developed with the Immobilon substrate
(Millipore). Chemi-luminescence signals were captured on
HyBlot CL film (Denville).

Closed, circular pRLSV40 plasmid (3705 bp)
(0.5 µg) was incubated with various concentrations of
each chemical in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 37⁰ C for
5 minutes [48]. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was
analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.6% agarose gel at 4⁰ C.
The gel was incubated in ethidium bromide for 30 minutes
and photographed under UV light.
