ABSTRACT
Systemic siRNA administration to target and treat glioblastoma, one of the
most deadly cancers, requires robust and efficient delivery platform without
immunogenicity. Here we report newly emerged multivalent naked RNA nanoparticle
(RNP) based on pRNA 3-way-junction (3WJ) from bacteriophage phi29 to target
glioblastoma cells with folate (FA) ligand and deliver siRNA for gene silencing.
Systemically injected FA-pRNA-3WJ RNPs successfully targeted and delivered siRNA
into brain tumor cells in mice, and efficiently reduced luciferase reporter gene
expression (4-fold lower than control). The FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP also can target human
patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells, thought to be responsible for tumor initiation
and deadly recurrence, without accumulation in adjacent normal brain cells, nor other
major internal organs. This study provides possible application of pRNA-3WJ RNP for
specific delivery of therapeutics such as siRNA, microRNA and/or chemotherapeutic
drugs into glioblastoma cells without inflicting collateral damage to healthy tissues.

INTRODUCTION

more aggressive when they recur, developing resistance
to the primary chemotherapy. We sought a new strategy
targeting both brain tumor cells and glioblastoma stem
cells to treat the primary brain tumor and prevent tumor
recurrence. RNA nanotechnology has been rapidly
growing as a new generation platform for biological
and medical application [2, 3]. As nanotechnology
rapidly evolves, many attempts have been made to
deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) using viruses,
liposome, lipid, and polymer based nanoparticles [4]. For
maximal potential, such nanoparticles must be delivered
systemically and specifically target intracranial tumors
with minimal toxicity. Recently, it was reported the pRNA

The most common primary brain tumors in adults
are glioblastomas, which are also one of the most deadly
cancers [1]. For glioblastomas, conventional treatment
involves surgical resection followed by radiation and
concurrent chemotherapy. Even with this treatment
regimen, the median survival of patients with glioblastoma
is less than 15 months. The poor prognosis is primarily
due to tumor recurrence, which is thought to originate
from a subset of cancer stem cells that survive the primary
treatments. Recent studies suggested that glioblastoma
stem cell survived the therapeutic stresses and become

three-way junction (pRNA-3WJ) of the bacteriophage
phi29 DNA packaging motor can be used to fabricate a
RNA nanoparticle (RNP) with precise control of shape,
size and stoichiometry [4-10]. Creation of boiling
resistant RNPs with controllable shapes and defined
stoichiometry has been recently reported [11]. The pRNA3WJ nanoparticles with 2’-Fluoro (2’-F) modifications
of U and C nucleotides renders the RNPs resistant to
RNase degradation enhancing their in vivo half-life while
retaining authentic functions of the incorporated modules
[7, 12, 13]. Furthermore, the pRNA-3WJ RNPs were
non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and displayed favorable
biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles in mice
[14]. These favorable characteristics make this novel
platform attractive for the systemic delivery of siRNA
to glioblastoma. One promising ligand for nanoparticle
therapy in glioblastoma targeting is folate, a natural
member of the B-vitamin family. Folate is required for
early neuronal development and differentiation [15]. Its
transportation across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier
(BCSF) occurs by the choroid plexus [16]. The choroid
plexus expresses the largest amount of folate receptor
(FR) in a body, while no FR expression is detected in
cerebellum, cerebrum or spinal cord [17, 18]. Since
folate is an essential component required during DNA
replication and methylation in highly proliferating cells,
many cancer cells, such as those of the brain, ovary, lung,
breast, kidney, endometrium, colon and bone marrow,
over-express FRs to increase folate uptake [19]. Folic acid
(FA), a synthetic oxidized form of folate, has been widely
used as a ligand in various cancer targeting materials [20].
Herein, we report a new strategy to target and
deliver therapeutic siRNA to brain tumors using FAconjugated pRNA-3WJ RNP. We first established
intracranial tumor xenograft models in mice and then
systemically administered RNPs through the tail vein.
Based on fluorescence imaging, we demonstrated that
the pRNA-3WJ RNP efficiently targeted and internalized
into brain tumor cells through FR-mediated endocytosis
with little or no accumulation in adjacent healthy brain
cells. Gene silencing by the RNPs was also demonstrated
within the luciferase gene expressing brain tumors. More
importantly, pRNA-3WJ RNPs were also capable of
targeting brain tumor stem cells derived from a human
patient. The data demonstrate that artificially engineered
RNPs can specifically target brain tumor cells, including
glioblastoma stem cells, and deliver functional siRNA
and possibly even therapeutic microRNAs (miRNAs)
[21]. The results will pave the way for developing
multifunctional RNPs for disrupting pathways involved
in glioblastoma biology.

siRNA and miRNA, into brain tumors in a mouse model
system. For targeted delivery of siRNA into brain tumors,
a multifunctional RNP was constructed, as previously
described [7, 12, 13, 22], using a scaffold based on
pRNA sequences of phi29 bacteriophage with slight
modifications (see Materials and Methods). Three RNA
modules individually transcribed in vitro or synthesized
chemically were mixed at equal molar ratio and formed
three-branched RNP via one-step self-assembly. Each
RNA module was designed to carry a functional moiety:
1) FA as the FR targeting ligand; 2) fluorophore Alexa647
as the imaging agent; and 3) luciferase siRNA as the
gene silencing functional moiety or scrambled RNA as a
negative control (Fig. 1A) [7, 12, 13, 22]. The resulting
RNP was named FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP. Observation
of the self-assembled FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP under
atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the formation of
homogeneous three-branched architectures with 3WJ core
in the center (Fig. 1B), confirming the previous reports that
modifications on each RNA module did not abrogate the
shape-controlled self-assembly to retain the pRNA-3WJ
core structure essential for homogeneous RNP formation.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) determined average
hydrodynamic diameters of FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP
to be 5.2 ± 1.2 nm (Fig. 1C), which was smaller than the
predicted size (10 × 4 × 2 nm) calculated by RNA folding
software based on expected duplex helix parameters and
base pair lengths of the three individual RNA modules.
The discrepancy between DLS measurement and
computational prediction implies that each protruded
branch of FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP was avoided from
averaging three dimensions due to rapid motion of RNPs
in solution. Another factor that needs to be addressed for
successful systemic in vivo application of nanoparticles is
freedom from aggregation to avoid rapid clearance from
the body and diminished specific interaction between
the conjugated ligand and cellular target receptors.
Aggregation depends largely on the surface charge of
nanoparticles and the surface of RNA is indeed highly
charged. Aggregation will also change the surface charge
proportional to the extent of size increase. To determine
the aggregation extent, FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP was
subjected to zeta potential analysis to measure the particle
surface charge. Zeta potential of FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc)
RNP in DEPC H2O was measured as a single peak at ‒15.8
± 5.6 mV (Fig. 1D), indicating that most FA-pRNA-3WJsi(luc) RNP exist as a single form without aggregation.
These physical properties favor the FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc)
RNP for systemic in vivo application.
Human glioblastoma cells are known to overexpress
FR, while normal brain cells show no FR expression
[17-19]. To determine the specific recognition and
binding capability of FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(luc) RNP
towards human glioblastoma cells, firstly association
of FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ with U87EGFRvIII cell
was tested in vitro in comparison to FA-free control

RNP (Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ). Flow cytometry analysis
showed a higher association of FA-Alexa647-pRNA3WJ with U87EGFRvIII cells (63.1 ± 4.5%) than that of
Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ (40.3 ± 3.7%) (student t-test, p <
0.001, n=4) (Fig. 2A). When FRs of U87EGFRvIII cells
were pre-masked by incubating with 1 mM free-folate for
1 hr of culture before the RNP binding, the association
between FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ and U87EGFRvIII
cells was decreased to an extent similar to the negative
control Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ (Supplementary Fig. S1),
indicating that the association between FA-Alexa647pRNA-3WJ and U87EGFRvIII cells was FR dependent.
The FR-mediated specific binding of FA-Alexa647pRNA-3WJ to U87EGFRvIII cells was further confirmed
by visualizing the Alexa647 signal from surface-cultured
U87EGFRvIII cells treated with FA-Alexa647-pRNA3WJ RNP under confocal fluorescence microscope. Higher

fluorescence intensity of Alexa647 dye was observed from
U87EGFRvIII cells treated with FA-Alexa647-pRNA3WJ than those with control RNP (Alexa647-pRNA3WJ) (Fig. 2B). Again, the FA-dependent association of
FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP was abolished by pretreatment of U87EGFRvIII cells with 1 mM free folate
in culture medium (Fig. 2B). The FR-mediated specific
association between FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP and
human glioblastoma cell was also observed with other
glioblastoma cell lines including T98G (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Taken together, FA-conjugated pRNA-3WJ RNP
has the capability to recognize and bind to human brain
tumor cells through FR.
Next, we tested whether FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP can
specifically target tumor cells in vivo using an orthotropic
mouse model of glioblastoma. On the 14th day post
U87EGFRvIII cell implantation into nude mouse brain,

intracranial tumor growth in mice was determined by
MRI (Fig. 2C, top) and randomly separated into three
groups for injection of PBS and Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ
as two negative controls, and FA-Alexa647-pRNA3WJ as experimental. Each group of mice (n=4) was
injected via tail vein (1 mg/kg of RNP in 100 μL of
PBS). Fifteen hours post injection, the mice brains were
dissected and subjected to fluorescence imaging to detect
the Alexa647 signal from RNP. A higher fluorescence
signal of Alexa647 was observed in the brains of mice
injected with FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ than that in the
mice brains injected with control RNP (Alexa647-pRNA3WJ) (Fig. 2C). ANOVA analysis on the fluorescence
intensity from each group (n=4) normalized by their tumor
volumes (Alexa647 intensity/tumor volume) confirmed the

significant increase in average fluorescence intensity in
the mouse brains treated with FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ
(2.052±0.416, s.e.m.) compared to Alexa647-pRNA3WJ (1.014±0.279, s.e.m.) (p=0.019) with respect to PBS
(1.000±0.298, s.e.m.) (Fig. 2D). The brain tumor region
was frozen sectioned (10 µm thick) and further examined
under a fluorescence confocal microscope. It revealed that
FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP was mostly associated
with counterstained brain tumor cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3). These in vivo data strongly indicated that systemically
injected FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP can travel to
brain tissue, and successfully recognize and bind human
glioblastoma cells through FA-FR interaction, rather than
randomly distribute throughout the entire brain tissues.
After binding to target glioblastoma cells, RNP

needs to internalize to deliver its cargo, siRNA, for
successful target gene silencing, which is the most critical
property for any nanoparticle to claim its therapeutic
application. In order to test whether siRNA-loaded FA3WJ RNP can silence the target gene in glioblastoma cells
in mouse brain after systemic administration, we set up
a luciferase-based gene expression reporter system by

implanting luciferase gene-expressing U87EGFRvIII cells
(U87EGFRvIII-Luc) in mouse brain. For a preliminary
in vitro test, U87EGFRvIII-Luc cells were incubated for
72 hrs in culture medium containing a range between 0
and 400 nM of FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) or scrambled
RNA-conjugated control FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm)
RNPs without any transfection agent. After 72 hrs, FA-

pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) clearly reduced luciferase activity in
a concentration dependent manner. At 400 nM, average
luciferase activity in U87EGFRvIII-Luc cells incubated
with FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) was decreased about
five folds (0.214±0.210, s.e.m.) with respect to 0 nM.
However, FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm) did not significantly
reduce luciferase activity in the cells (0.876±0.056,
s.e.m.) compared to 0 nM. The difference of luciferase
activity at 400 nM between FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) and
FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm) was statistically significant
(p=0.006) (Fig. 3A). For in vivo test, intracranial tumor
in mice was induced by implanting U87EGFRvIII-Luc
cells. Bioluminescence signal measured from the resulted
brain tumor is expected to correlate with tumor growth.
When a group of brain tumor-bearing mice (n=5) were
systemically injected with FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm) (1
mg/kg in 100 μL of PBS) for a total of three times over
6 days, the luciferase activity rapidly increased as the
tumor grew indicating no effect of the control RNP on
luciferase gene expression. However, luciferase activity
from the group of mice (n=5) injected with FA-pRNA3WJ-si(Luc) was observed to increase very slowly over
time (Fig. 3B). After 3 injections, the luciferase activity
from the mice injected with FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) was
significantly lower (p=0.007) than that from the control
group mice injected with FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm). The
luciferase activity from the tested mice at day 13 post
tumor implantation was mostly lower than that from the
mice treated with FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm) (Fig. 3C).
However, MRI revealed that the relative tumor size
between those two groups was statistically insignificant
(1.160±0.352 mm3, s.e.m. with respect to 1.000±0.300
mm3 in negative control group) (p=0.468, n=5) (Fig. 3D).
When their luciferase activity was normalized by the
tumor volumes, the relatively averaged luciferase activity
over tumor volumes from the mice treated with FA-pRNA3WJ-si(Luc) (0.255±0.040 Luminescence Radiance [p/s/
cm²/sr]/tumor volume [mm3], s.e.m.) was significantly
lower compared to the control mice group treated with
FA-pRNA-3WJ-si(Scrm) (1.000±0.410 Luminescence
Radiance [p/s/cm²/sr]/tumor volume [mm3], s.e.m.)
(p=0.015, n=5) (Fig. 3E). These data strongly indicated
that FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP not only specifically targeted
glioblastoma cells, but also successfully internalized into
the cells and delivered the cargo siRNA. The delivered
siRNA, more importantly, remained functionally intact
for the whole time of systemic delivery, confirming both
stability and therapeutic efficacy of the FA-pRNA-3WJ
RNPs. The data successfully demonstrated the therapeutic
usability as a siRNA delivery system for glioblastoma
treatment.
In clinical settings, glioblastomas are notorious for
their frequent recurrence with increased aggressiveness
after initial therapy, resulting in poor survival rates. It has
been hypothesized that glioblastoma stem cells tend to
survive the initial treatment and induce tumor recurrence,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

meaning that any therapeutic strategy lacking the ability to
kill glioblastoma stem cells would not prevent recurrences
[23]. The potential of FA-pRNA-3WJ RNPs to target
glioblastoma stem cells and their derived tumor cells
was investigated. We used human glioblastoma patient–
derived primary neurosphere cells, named “1123”, which
has been shown to possess stem cell-like characteristics
including a high level of CD44 expression, self-renewal
capability and tumorigenicity when implanted in mouse
brain [24-26]. First, the CD44+ 1123 cells, maintained
in serum-free sphere culture medium, were incubated in
vitro with 200 nM of either FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ or
Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNPs. Flow cytometry analysis
revealed higher FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ binding to the
1123 cells than control RNP (Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ) (Fig.
4A). Compared to PBS-treated 1123 cells, 33.2 ± 0.8%
of CD44+ 1123 cells were positively associated with FAAlexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP. However, Alexa647-pRNA3WJ control RNP was associated with only 12.7 ± 0.4% of
CD44+ 1123 cells. The difference between FA-Alexa647pRNA-3WJ and Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ was statistically
significant (p<0.0001).
For systemic assessment, a group of mice was then
implanted with 1123 cells to induce intracranial brain
tumor. Determined by MRI, mice bearing a similar size
of brain tumors were then injected with PBS, Alexa647pRNA-3WJ or FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNPs in 100 μL
of PBS through the tail vein. Fifteen hours post injection,
the brains were dissected out and subjected to fluorescence
imaging. Higher accumulation of FA-Alexa647-pRNA3WJ RNP was observed in the tumor region, while less
accumulation of Alexa647 signal was observed from the
brains treated with either control RNP (Alexa647-pRNA3WJ) or PBS (Fig. 4B). When two different dosages of
FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNPs (20 or 100 μg/mouse)
were tested in a group of mice bearing small sized
tumors, fluorescence signals were proportional to the
amount of RNPs injected (Supplementary Fig. S4). These
observations suggests that FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP
can also recognize and target human glioblastoma stem
cells and their derived tumor cells through FA-FR specific
interaction. Throughout these studies, a fluorescence signal
from the groups treated with FA-free 3WJ-pRNA control
RNP was also observed although the extents were always
lower than the groups treated with FA-3WJ-pRNA RNP.
This might be explained by the nature of tumor induced
from human patient derived stem cell-like glioblastoma
cells, in which the aggressive hypervasculature leaves a
large portion of blood vessels as “leaky” as they are poorly
finished before forming a tight junction of the BBB, also
called the EPR (enhanced permeability and retention)
effect [27].
To assess the biodistribution profile of the
pRNA-3WJ RNP throughout the body after systemic
administration, major internal organs, including heart,
lung, liver, spleen and kidney, were also collected
14771

Oncotarget

together with brain and subjected to fluorescence imaging.
Compared to brain, no significant fluorescence signal was
detected from the internal organs except kidney (Fig.
4C). The biodistribution profile of FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP
after its systemic administration was consistent with the
previous report [28], in that FA-conjugated drugs that
failed to target tumor cells are cleared from a mouse
body through the kidney, reducing the safety concern
of unbound pRNA-3WJ nanoparticles circulating in the
blood [7, 12-14].

RNP for human glioblastoma detection and treatment,
it was critical to evaluate its capability to access brain
tumor cells by discriminating them from adjacent normal
brain cells, and to have favorable biodistribution. To
address those two goals, the most critical checkpoints
deciding the drugability of the pRNA-3WJ nanoparticles,
we employed an orthotropic intracranial glioblastoma
model system in mice. According to our observations, it
was clear that FA-conjugated FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP can
target human glioblastoma cells through FA-FR specific
interaction-mediated endocytosis by distinguishing
glioma cells from adjacent normal brain cells. A series of
in vitro experiments indicated that such targeting in vivo
was not obviously a result of non-specific accumulation

DISCUSSION
For successful clinical application of pRNA-3WJ

for two reasons: 1) association of FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP
with glioblastoma cells was ligand-dependent; and 2)
the association was mediated through FA-FR specific
interaction, since free folate pre-treatment interfered with
the specific interaction between FA and FRs on the targeted
cells. This suggests that FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP can target
and accumulate in FR+ glioblastoma cells. Taken together
with the fact that our brain imaging data were collected 15
hrs post injection of FA-3WJ RNA nanoparticles and the
luciferase gene silencing effect was seen for days, these
data suggest that FA-pRNA-3WJ RNP can survive in the
body by retaining the chemical integrity of cargo siRNA
until it reaches the brain. Most importantly, the therapeutic
delivery by the FA-3WJ RNA nanoparticles was clearly
demonstrated by targeting endogenous luciferase mRNAs
as a reporter system (Fig. 3). The decreased luciferase
activity observed from a group of mice injected with
FA-3WJ-pRNA-si(Luc) RNP clearly answered questions
towards the capability of the FA-3WJ RNP regarding: 1)
specific targeting to brain tumor cells; 2) internalization
into brain tumor cells; and 3) releasing the functional
moiety (siRNA against luciferase mRNA). In addition,
the targeting capability of pRNA-3WJ nanoparticles for
both brain tumor cells and glioblastoma stem cells through
a FA-FR mediated manner will overcome the weak point
of conventional brain tumor therapies which largely relies
on surgical debulking and less-specific toxic drugs with
radiation. In summary, our current study successfully
demonstrated the drugability of FA-conjugated pRNA3WJ RNP as therapeutic gene delivery for clinical
applications to meet the urgent need of new strategies
to target and kill both glioblastoma stem cells and their
derived tumor cells. Due to the ease and flexibility of
modification of each RNA module, any drug conjugation
and siRNA can be loaded to the RNP as therapeutic
functionalities. Recently, microRNAs have been found to
involve in pathological process in glioblastoma making
them as promising therapeutic targets [29-32]. Since
size and working mechanism of miRNAs are similar to
those of siRNAs [21], therapeutic miRNAs also can be
considered to be loaded onto the pRNA-3WJ-RNP.

2’-F modified nucleotides and purified separately to
homogeneity. For the current study, each RNA module
was further modified as following: module a3WJ was
extended with luciferase siRNA sequences (sense:
5’-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAUU-3’ and anti-sense:
5’-UCGAAGUACUCAGCGUAAGUU-3’), or scrambled
as negative control; module b3WJ was conjugated with
FA at the 3’ end; and module c3WJ was conjugated with
fluorophore Alexa647 (Alexa Fluor® 647, Invitrogen) at
the 3’ end. The three RNA modules were mixed at equal
molar ratio to form one-step self-assembly. The selfassembled FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) RNPs were
purified from 8 M urea-containing PAGE and frozen at
-80ºC after reconstituted in PBS. To obtain the designated
concentration for each experiment, the RNPs were further
diluted in PBS before use.

Characterization of self-assembled FA-Alexa647pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) RNP
Three dimensional structure and shape of the
final form of self-assembled FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJsi(Luc) RNP was analyzed by atomic force microscopy
(AFM) imaging as described previously [7, 12, 13, 22].
Apparent hydrodynamic sizes and zeta potential of preassembled FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc) RNP (1.5
µM) in DEPC H2O was measured by Zetasizer nano-ZS
(Malvern Instrument) at 25°C. The laser wavelength was
633 nm. The data were obtained from three independent
measurements.

Human glioblastoma cells and human patientderived glioblastoma stem cells
Human glioblastoma cells, U87EGFRvIII and
U87EGFRvIII-Luc (expressing luciferase reporter gene),
were obtained from Dr. Webster Cavenee (Ludwig Cancer
Institute, San Diego, CA). Both cells were maintained
in DMEM/10% FBS/penicillin/streptomycin. Human
glioblastoma patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell
“1123” [24] was cultured in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with B27 (1:50), heparin (5 mg/mL), basic
FGF (bFGF) (20 ng/mL), and EGF (20 ng/mL). Growth
factors (bFGF and EGF) were added twice a week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc)
RNP

Intracranial human glioblastoma xenografts from
human glioblastoma cells and human patientderived glioblastoma stem cells

Multifunctional pRNA-3WJ RNP was prepared
as previously described [7, 12, 13, 22] with slight
modifications. In brief, three RNA modules, named
a3WJ (5’-UUGCCAUGUGUAUGUGGG-3’),
b3WJ
(5’-CCCACAUACUUUGUUGAUCC-3’),
and
c3WJ
(5’-GGAUCAAUCAUGGCAA-3’),
were
transcribed in vitro or synthesized chemically using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Six weeks old athymic female nu/nu mice (Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed and handled in
accordance with the Subcommittee on Research Animal
Care of the Ohio State University guidelines approved
by the Institutional Review Board. All mice were fed
14773

Oncotarget

folate-free diet (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) for at least two
weeks before tumor implantation. Intracranial human
glioblastoma xenograft tumor was induced by implanting
human glioblastoma cell U87EGFRvIII or human patientderived glioblastoma stem cells (1×105 cells per mouse),
as described previously [33]. Two weeks post intracranial
tumor implantation, the location and size of the implanted
tumors were determined by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).

Microscope System (Olympus Corp.) at the wavelengths
of 461 nm (for the cell nucleus stained by DAPI), 530
nm (for the cytoskeleton stained by Alexa Fluor 488
Phalloidin) and 665 nm (for the Alexa647). Images were
analyzed by Olympus FluoView Viewer software ver. 4.0
(Olympus). For in vivo targeting, the brain tumor xenograft
collected 15 hrs after RNP injection was fixed in 4% PFA
with 10% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4ºC and embedded
in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek USA,
Inc., Torrance, CA) for frozen sectioning (10 µm thick).
The sectioned samples were mounted by ProLong®
Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) overnight. The fluorescent
images were obtained using FluoView FV1000-Filter
Confocal Microscope System (Olympus Corp.).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for location
and size of implanted brain tumor in mice
On the indicated day post-surgery of intracranial
tumor injection, the location and size of the implanted
tumors were determined by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Mouse was anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane
mixed with 1 L/min carbogen (95% O2 with 5% CO2),
then maintained with 1% isoflurane thereafter. Maintaining
core temperature using a warm water bath, imaging was
performed using a Bruker Biospin 94/30 magnet (Bruker
Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). Mice were injected with
Magnevist, gadolinium-based contrast agent (Bayer
Health Care Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ) by an i.p.
administration with 0.5 mmol/kg dose, then positioned in
the magnet. T2-weighted RARE imaging was collected
using a sequence (TR = 3524 ms, TE = 36 ms, rare factor
= 8, navgs = 2, FOV=20×20 mm, 0.5 mm slice thickness).
Region-of-interest (ROI) was manually outlined based on
contrast in signal intensity between brain and tumor tissue.

Flow cytometry for in vitro RNP binding
Flow cytometry analysis was performed for in
vitro targeting by pRNA-3WJ RNP in malignant human
glioblastoma (U87EGFRvIII) and glioblastoma stem
cells (1123). The cells were plated in 6-well plate one day
before RNP binding. After washing with PBS, the cells
were incubated with 200 nM of either FA-Alexa647pRNA-3WJ RNP or Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP in 200
µL of culture media for 2 hrs at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.
For blocking cellular FRs by free folate, the PBS-washed
cells were pre-treated with 1 mM of free folate in 200 µL
of culture media for 1 hr in 37°C CO2 incubator before
RNP treatment. After washing with PBS, the cells were
harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 4% PFA solution
for 2 hrs at 4°C. The cells were washed with PBS for
3 times at room temperature, then subjected to Flow
Cytometry analysis using BD FACS Aria-III Cell Sorter.
The data were analyzed by FlowJo 7.6.1 software.

Fluorescence confocal microscopy for in vitro and
in vivo RNP binding
For the in vitro targeting test of pRNA-3WJ RNP, 2
× 103 of U87EGFRvIII (malignant human glioblastoma)
cells in 200 µL were plated in Lab-TekII 8-well chamber
slide (Nunc, Rochester, NY). The next day, the cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with 200 nM of
either FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ RNP or control RNP
(Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ) in 200 µL of culture media for
2 hrs at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. To block cellular FRs
by free folate, PBS-washed cells were pre-treated with
1 mM free folate in 200 µL of culture media for 1 hr at
37°C in a CO2 incubator before RNP treatment. After
washing with PBS, the RNP-treated cells were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 2 hrs at 4°C. The
cytoskeleton of the fixed cells was stained by Alexa Fluor
488 Phalloidin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) for 30 min
at room temperature and the nucleus stained with 0.01%
DAPI solution for 10 min at room temperature. The cells
were then rinsed with PBS for 3 × 10 min and mounted
with PermaFluor Aqueous Mounting Medium (Thermo
Scientific). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using
Olympus 4-filter-based FluoView FV1000-Filter Confocal

Systemic injection of RNPs to intracranial human
glioblastoma xenograft tumor bearing mice
Based on the MRI evaluation taken one day before
RNP injection, a group of mice bearing similarly sized
tumors at similar location was selected for systemic
injection of RNPs. Designated amount of RNPs (1 mg/kg
of mouse body weight) prepared in 100 µL of PBS were
injected through mouse tail vein. After 15 hrs of RNP
injection, the brains were dissected out and subjected to
fluorescence imaging. Tumor volume calculated from
MRI was also used to normalize fluorescence intensity or
luciferase activity for each mouse as described below.

To investigate the delivery of pRNA-3WJ RNPs in
vivo, a brain fluorescence imaging study was performed
after tail vein injection into mice bearing brain tumor.
The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under
anesthesia 15 hrs post injection, and brains were dissected
out of mice. Fluorescence signals were detected from the
dissected brains using IVIS Lumina Series III Pre-clinical
In Vivo Imaging System (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA)
with excitation at 640 nm and emission at 660 nm for 2
min exposure. The fluorescence intensity was expressed
as Mean Radiant Efficiency [p/s/cm²/sr] / [µW/cm²], then
normalized by tumor volume (mm3). PBS injected mice
were used as fluorescence negative control. Major internal
organs together with brain from the harvested mice were
collected and subjected to fluorescence imaging for
assessment of biodistribution profile study.

To investigate the siRNA delivery and silencing
effect of pRNA-3WJ RNPs in vivo, U87EGFRvIII-Luc
cell-induced brain tumor was prepared into two groups of
mice (n=5). At 5, 7 and 9 days post-surgery, 1 mg/kg of
mouse body weight of FA-Alexa647-pRNA-3WJ-si(Luc)
RNP (or siScrm as negative control) was injected through
the mouse tail vein in 100 µL of PBS. After each injection,
mice were subjected to bioluminescence whole body
imaging to detect the endogenous luciferase expression
level. Mice were injected with 75 mg/kg Luciferin (Perkin
Elmer, Waltham, MA), and anesthetized. Bioluminescence
from the anesthetized mice was detected by ZFOV-24
zoom lens-installed IVIS Lumina Series III Pre-clinical
In Vivo Imaging System (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).
The luminescence intensity was expressed as Averaged
Radiance [p/s/cm²/sr], then normalized by tumor volume
(mm3).
