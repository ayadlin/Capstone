BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess activity and toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed,
advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who were receiving dose-intense paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and filgrastim delivered with a flexible dosing schedule. METHODS: Patients with stage III/IV EOC received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, followed by a 24-hour infusion of paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day
2. Filgrastim began on Day 3 at 10 lg/kg daily for 9 days. Patients received 6 cycles of all drugs. Those who achieved
a pathologic complete response or had microscopic residual disease at the conclusion of 6 cycles of therapy received
an additional 2 to 4 cycles of paclitaxel with cyclophosphamide. Patients who had an objective response continued
on cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Thirty-two of 62 patients had stage
IIIC disease, and 26 of 62 patients had stage IV disease. According to an intent-to-treat analysis, 55 patients (89%)
experienced a clinical complete remission. At a median potential follow-up of 11.4 years, the median progression-free
survival was 18.9 months, and the median survival was 5.4 years. The most serious toxicity was grade 3/4 neutropenic
fever (35%). Although all participants developed peripheral neuropathy, improvement in neuropathic symptoms
began with the decrease or cessation of paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: The studied regimen yielded a high response rate
and encouraging overall survival. The current data and those reported by the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group
suggest that further study is warranted of dose-dense or dose-intense paclitaxel regimens in women with newly diagC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States,
and 15,520 deaths are expected in 2008.1 It continues to be associated with a poor prognosis and advanced-stage disease at
presentation.2 Most women with advanced-stage disease can anticipate optimal surgical cytoreduction and a subsequent
response to platinum-based chemotherapy, yet most will experience tumor recurrence and eventual death from EOC. Sustained remissions and cures remain rare in women with advanced-stage disease.
Many approaches have been explored to optimize and improve the initial treatment. Interval surgical cytoreduction
has been tested without notable advantage in the paclitaxel era. Other approaches in initial systemic therapy include tripledrug or sequential doublet regimens,3,4 maintenance therapy,5 introduction of novel treatment regimens (including

dose intensification.7-11 Limited advances, albeit statistically significant, have been observed. Recent reports indicate that dose-dense taxane therapy benefits patients with
breast cancer and EOC. After standard adjuvant therapy,
patients with breast cancer who received weekly paclitaxel
had improved disease-free survival (progression-free survival [PFS]) and overall survival (OS) compared with
patients who received paclitaxel every 3 weeks.12 More relevant are recent results from the Japanese Gynecologic
Oncology Group (JGOG), who demonstrated improved
PFS in women with stage II through IV disease who
treated with carboplatin coupled with weekly paclitaxel at
a dose of 80 mg/m2 compared with standard schedule
paclitaxel (180 mg/m2) delivered every 3 weeks.11
In this article, we report the activity, toxicity, and
10-year survival outcome of women with EOC in a phase
2 trial of a dose-intense paclitaxel regimen. Prospective
goals were to define the surgical response rate, a flexible
filgrastim dosing schedule to maintain paclitaxel dose
density, individualization of treatment duration, and
portability through multi-institutional collaboration. Secondary objectives were the characterization of OS and
PFS and the kinetics of neurotoxicity.
Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, with differing and
potentially synergistic mechanisms of action, were combined with dose-intensified paclitaxel.13-16 Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubule assembly17 and slows the repair of
DNA lesions, including cisplatin adducts and cyclophosphamide cross-links.16,18 We defined the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel as 250 mg/m2 given as a 24-hour
infusion with flexible filgrastim support19 and determined
its safety when combined with cyclophosphamide 750
mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2.20 Administration of the
triplet to patients with advanced stage EOC led to an
89% clinical response rate and a 61% surgical response
rate (microscopic and pathologic) in a single-institution
study of patients with EOC.20 That phase 2 study defined
the activity and tolerability of this dose-intense paclitaxel
combination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility and Pretreatment
Evaluation
The study was approved by the institutional review boards
at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH). Eligibility criteria included
women with untreated, newly diagnosed, International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III/IV

EOC; initiation of therapy within 6 weeks of staging laparotomy; creatinine clearance 60 mL/minute; good endorgan function; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status between 0 and 2; and informed consent. Patients were excluded for a prior history of invasive
cancer, myocardial infarction, or unstable dysrhythmia
within 6 months of study entry or for gastrointestinal
bleeding within 1 month of entry.
Drug Administration
Agents were provided by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program, NCI. NCI patients received their first cycle in
the hospital and received subsequent cycles as outpatients,
whereas MGH patients received all cycles in the hospital.
The premedication, treatment, and dose modification
schema are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Cisplatin was limited
to 6 cycles to minimize the risk of allergic reactions and
cumulative neurotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel were continued in patients who required >6 cycles
to achieve the best clinical response and after surgical reassessment. Subsequent cycles were initiated if nonhematologic toxicity was grade <3 and if their absolute
granulocyte count was 1500 cells/mm3.
Toxicity Assessment and Dose Modification
Drug compliance and toxicity were assessed at each visit
and were graded using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
version 1.0 (CTC v1.0). Proprioception, vibration, and
pinprick sensory modalities; deep tendon reflexes; Romberg maneuver; and tandem gait were evaluated in each
cycle. The paclitaxel dose was modified for objective clinical findings with functional impairment consistent with
CTC v1.0 grade 3 neurologic toxicity.
Outcome Assessment
Patients underwent clinical assessment every cycle and radiographic assessment every 2 cycles. Patients who had
normal physical examination, CA 125 levels, and radiographic studies after 6 cycles (clinical complete response
[CCR]) underwent surgical reassessment. Therapy after
surgical assessment was guided based on intraoperative
findings. Two cycles of paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide
were administered to patients who had pathologically negative findings, whereas women who had microscopic residual disease received 2 to 4 additional cycles. Patients
who had unresectable gross residual tumor (pathologic
partial response [PPR]) were referred to other treatments.
Patients who did not attain a CCR after 6 cycles received
from 2 up to 4 additional cycles of paclitaxel and

cyclophosphamide if they still were responding. Continued persistent disease led to a change in therapy. All
patients were followed for survival.
Disease outcomes were measured using radiographic
imaging studies and/or physical examinations. Response
was documented as a CCR, or a partial response (PR) that
lasted 4 weeks, or progressive disease (PD). A PR
required a reduction >50% in the sum of the products of
bidirectional measurements of tumor masses. Standard
PD definitions were used. Disease response was classified
further at surgery. Patients who had CCR and underwent
surgical assessment were categorized with a pathologic CR
(pCR), microscopic residual disease (micro), or a PPR.
Off-study criteria included failure to achieve a CCR,
PPR, or PD as the best response; grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity; and voluntary withdrawal.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objectives were to identify the pCR rate and
to determine regimen portability to another academic

1478

site; the study was defined to accrue up to 80 participants.
Assessments of OS and PFS were secondary objectives and
were calculated from the on-study date until the date of
death, disease progression, or last follow-up. OS and PFS
probabilities were computed using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Survival was censored at the time of the most
recent follow-up.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
This cohort had multiple indicators of a poor prognosis
(Table 3). All patients underwent attempts at optimal
debulking during surgical staging, and 42% had pathologically documented stage IV disease. Residual disease was
present at enrollment in 35 patients (44%), most of
whom had hepatic parenchymal involvement; 93% had
radiologic or clinically measurable disease, and 7% had residual effusions only. Forty-three percent of patients
underwent optimal debulking (<1 cm; n ¼ 27).

Response and Duration
The pCR rate, which was the primary study objective, is
presented in Tables 4 and 5. CCRs occurred in 55 patients
(89%), and 2 patients had a PR (overall response rate,
92%) (Table 4). All but 1 patient underwent an invasive
reassessment. pCRs occurred in 26 patients (47%), and
microscopic residual was identified in 20 patients (36%),
yielding an 84% overall pathologic response rate (Table
5). A patient who had microscopic disease at reassessment
had a pCR identified at surgery for an adhesion-induced
small bowel obstruction. The median potential follow-up
for the cohort was 11.4 years, the median PFS was 18.9
months (Fig. 1), and the median OS was 5.4 years (5-year
OS rate, 53%). When the results were restricted to patients
with stage IV disease who had parenchymal liver or splenic
involvement, the median PFS was 15.8 months, and the
median OS was 2.9 years, (5-year OS rate, 42%).

Drug Administration and Toxicity
A secondary objective was maintenance of dose density in
the first 6 cycles. Patients received a median of 10 courses
and 7 courses at NCI and MGH, respectively. Details of
dose modifications are shown in Table 6. The administered dose was maintained in 89% of patients during the
first 6 cycles, and 10 patients (16%) required increased filgrastim doses. Toxicity is presented in Table 7. Seventeen
patients (27%) had grade 3 neutropenic fever without a
documented source, and 5 patients had grade 4 neutropenic fever that required aggressive management. Filgrastim-induced bone pain was grade 1/2 in 19% of patients
and was reduced by premedication with acetaminophen
and diphenhydramine. The most common adverse events
were grade 2 fatigue (37%), peripheral neuropathy
(37%), nausea (27%), and diarrhea (24%). One patient
withdrew from the study with grade 2 tinnitus after 2
cycles. No deaths and no severe anaphylactoid reactions
occurred on study. There have been no secondary
malignancies.
The natural history of treatment-induced neuropathy was a secondary objective analyzed at NCI (Table 8).

impaired hearing during Cycle 2. Gabapentin, oxycodone, sertraline, and amitriptyline provided symptomatic
relief. Neurologic improvement began with paclitaxel
dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Nineteen
patients (41%) had complete resolution of neuropathy
with mean time to resolution of 14 months (median, 11
months; range 3-36 months).

DISCUSSION
We hypothesized that dose-intense paclitaxel, in combination with cyclophosphamide and cisplatin and flexible
filgrastim dosing, would yield improved pCR or microscopic response rates compared with historic controls and
Cancer

that this might translate into improved long-term outcomes. We individualized the number of administered
treatment cycles, gave consolidation therapy after reassessment surgery, and maintained dose intensity with flexible
filgrastim dosing. The portability of this regimen was
demonstrated through a multi-institutional collaboration
between the NCI and MGH. Administration of this 3drug regimen resulted in 92% CCR and 84% pCR or microscopic residual disease. The median OS was 5.4 years,
and the median PFS was 18.9 months (the median PFS
was 15.8 months for patients with stage IV parenchymal
organ involvement). Although a direct comparison is neither feasible nor appropriate, at the least, outcomes are
comparable and may be superior to outcomes in institutional historic controls and to the outcomes reported in

phase 3 carboplatin/paclitaxel control arms for optimally
debulked patients.4,20,21
Since the initiation of this trial in 1995, several
reports have suggested a benefit of dose-dense paclitaxel in
breast and ovarian cancers.7,8,11,12 Patients with breast
cancer who received weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 over 1
hour for 12 doses after standard adjuvant therapy experienced improved PFS and OS compared with patients who
were randomized to receive paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3
hours every 3 weeks for 4 doses.12 A phase 2 trial in
patients with stage IIB through IV EOC who received
weekly paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 followed by carboplatin
AUC, 2 for a total of 18 cycles (which were interrupted by
treatment breaks every 6 cycles), had a median PFS of 21
months, and an OS of 43 months.22 The JGOG recently
reported their randomized trial of patients who had stage
II through IV EOC and received carboplatin (AUC, 6)
with either dose-dense paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly) or
paclitaxel 180 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.11 Twenty percent of
those patients had stage II disease, and 45% underwent
optimal debulking. PFS was significantly improved in the
dose-dense paclitaxel arm (median, 27.9 months vs 17.1
months; P ¼ .0014). OS at 2 years favored the dose-dense
cohort (83.6% vs 77.7%; P ¼ .05). Our median PFS of
18.9 months in a cohort of patients with stage IIIC/IV
disease suggests the potential of our regimen.

Randomized clinical trials to date have failed to
demonstrate the superiority of a triplet regimen using
pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine against
standard carboplatin and paclitaxel (PFS, 15.4-16.4
months).4 To our knowledge, no triplets have incorporated dose-dense or dose-intense paclitaxel. In a randomized trial, the addition of epirubicin to paclitaxel and
carboplatin (AUC, 5) increased toxicity and did not
improve activity.23 In the absence of a randomized trial, it
is impossible to determine the contribution of each
component in the triplet to the observed activity and
toxicity.
Biasing against overall PFS may be the nonstandard
and aggressive follow-up approach used at the NCI of
computed tomography scans, physical examinations, and
CA 125 measurements every other month for the first
year. This may have resulted in the earlier detection of disease recurrence, often before notable increases in CA 125.
This detection of early recurrence was followed by prompt
therapeutic intervention and, thus, may account for the
relatively short median PFS. However, in view of the
JGOG data, it is also possible that the dose-intense paclitaxel played a role. The JGOG regimen administered
paclitaxel at a dose of 240mg/m2 over 3 weeks, comparable to our dose of 250 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. A previous
Gynecologic Oncology Group study failed to

demonstrate improved survival in patients who were
randomized to receive paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 or cisplatin
100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks compared with patients who
received paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2;
however, the interpretation of this trial was complicated
because of an imbalance in the treatment arms.24 Our
dose-intense regimen and the JGOG dose-dense regimen
used higher net doses of paclitaxel in combination with a
platinum compound. Unlike regimens that contain carboplatin, there was no evidence of long-term bone marrow injury.
All patients experienced some peripheral neuropathy,
which is a major reason for discontinuing cisplatin use in
EOC, but it was grade 2 in the majority of patients. Despite the assumption that cisplatin was the cause of neuropathy in this regimen, neuropathy began to resolve after
paclitaxel was decreased or discontinued. We previously
described neuropathy as the dose-limiting toxicity of highdose, single-agent paclitaxel and demonstrated that toxicity was not augmented by the addition of cisplatin.19,20
Early dose reduction of paclitaxel for neuropathy in this
study occurred in only 3 patients, whereas 9 patients
required late dose modification after 6 cycles, consistent
with a late and cumulative process. Resolution of neuropathy was observed in 41% of patients, and the median time
to resolution was 11 months (range, 3-36 months).
In summary, this triplet dose-intense paclitaxelbased regimen resulted in a high pathologic response rate
and encouraging OS. Outcome analyses of this generally
poor-prognosis group of patients with advanced-stage disease usually are inferior, which makes the current findings
potentially noteworthy. The JGOG results and ours
reported herein suggest that the combination of dosedense/intense paclitaxel and a platinum may warrant further study for the treatment of patients with advancedstage EOC.
