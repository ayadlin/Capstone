ABSTRACT
Interleukin (IL)-24 is a tumor suppressor/cytokine gene that undergoes
post-translational modifications (PTMs). Glycosylation and ubiquitination are
important for IL-24 protein stabilization and degradation respectively. Little is
known about IL-24 protein phosphorylation and its role in IL-24-mediated anti-tumor
activities. In this study we conducted molecular studies to determine whether IL-24
phosphorylation is important for IL-24-mediated anti-cancer activity.
Human H1299 lung tumor cell line that was stably transfected with a doxycycline
(DOX)-inducible (Tet-on) plasmid vector carrying the cDNA of IL-24-wild-type
(IL-24wt) or IL-24 with all five phosphorylation sites replaced (IL-24mt) was used in the
present study. Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and
induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed in DOX-induced IL-24wt-expressing
cells but not in IL-24mt-expressing cells. Secretion of IL-24mt protein was greatly
reduced compared to IL-24wt protein. Further, IL-24wt and IL-24mt proteins markedly
differed in their subcellular organelle localization. IL-24wt but not IL-24mt inhibited the
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. SiRNA-mediated AKT knockdown and overexpression
of myristolyated AKT protein confirmed that IL-24wt but not IL-24mt mediated its anticancer activity by inhibiting the AKT signaling pathway.
Our results demonstrate that IL-24 phosphorylation is required for inhibiting the
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and exerting its anti-cancer activities.

INTRODUCTION

investigated
whether
phosphorylation
affected
IL-24 cellular localization. Confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence revealed that IL-24wt protein
localized to the cytoplasm, ER, and Golgi. However,
IL-24mt protein was primarily localized to the perinuclear
area and overlapped with ER (Figure 1C). These results
suggest that phosphorylation of IL-24 protein is important
for proper subcellular localization and trafficking in the cells.
To determine whether these results were unique
to the stably-transfected H1299 single cell clone,
we transiently transfected naïve H1299 cells with
pcDNA3.1 plasmid DNA vector carrying IL-24wt and
IL-24mt cDNA under the control of constitutively active
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Supplementary
Figure 1A). Western blotting showed that IL-24wt- and
IL-24mt-expressing cells had different banding, irrespective
of the time of analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B).
We further tested IL-24 protein expression in a human
melanoma (MeWo) cell line and compared to protein
expression in H1299 cells by transient transfection
using the pcDNA3.1-IL24wt or -IL24mt plasmids. MeWo
and H1299 cells showed the same differences in the
protein banding for IL-24wt and IL-24mt (Supplementary
Figure 1C). Protein localization study results concurred
with the results that were observed with the stable H1299
cell line (Supplementary Figure 1D). Thus, the banding
pattern and organelle localization is not cell-line-specific,
and protein phosphorylation is important for IL-24 protein
maturation, localization, and secretion.

Interleukin (IL)-24 is a novel tumor suppressor
and a member of the IL-10 cytokine superfamily [1, 2].
Endogenous IL-24 protein expression is detectable in the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T- and B-cells
and in melanocytes [2, 3]. However, IL-24 protein expression
is lost in a majority of cancer cells of human origin [1, 2–4].
Previous studies from our laboratory and others have
demonstrated that IL-24 has anti-tumor, anti-metastatic,
and anti-angiogenic activities [3–8]. Further, studies have
also shown that IL-24 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and
stimulates the Th1-type immune response [2, 9], and is
subject to post-translational modifications (PTMs), including
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination [9–11].
IL-24 is reported to interact with protein kinase [12].
However, whether phosphorylation is required for
IL-24-mediated antitumor activities is unknown.
In the present study, we investigated whether
IL-24 phosphorylation is required for antitumor activities.
The human IL-24 DNA sequence has five potential
phosphorylation sites: Serine (Ser) 88, 101, and 161, and
Threonine (Thr) 111 and 133. Using molecular techniques,
we replaced all of the five phosphorylation sites, producing
a mutant (IL-24mt). We compared IL-24mt with wild-type
IL-24 (IL-24wt). New to science, our data show that
IL-24 phosphorylation is required for IL-24-mediated anticancer activities.
The present study provides a platform for identifying
the phosphorylation site(s) critical for IL-24 to function as
an anti-cancer drug. Studies investigating the molecular
mechanisms of IL-24 phosphorylation are also warranted.

IL-24mt protein secretion is reduced in
doxycycline-induced lung cancer cells

RESULTS

IL-24 protein is known to be secreted [6, 13, 14].
Phosphorylation is reported to regulate protein
secretion and function [15, 16]. To determine whether
phosphorylation modulates IL-24 protein secretion,
we used ELISA to analyze IL-24 protein in cell culture
supernatants from DOX-treated H1299-IL-24wt and H1299IL-24mt cells. We detected IL-24 protein in supernatants
collected from both cell types (Figure 1D). However, there
was markedly less IL-24 protein in IL-24mt-expressing
cells than in IL-24wt-expressing cells (Figure 1D). These
results demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates IL-24
protein secretion. Modification of the phosphorylation sites
resulted in intracellular retention of IL-24 protein, leading
to reduced secretion. Our western blot data (Supplementary
Figure 1C) also showed reduced IL-24 protein in the
culture supernatant from H1299 and MeWo cells.

IL-24wt and IL-24mt have different protein
banding patterns and cellular localization
IL-24wt-expressing H1299 cells showed a typical
expression pattern [3, 11] with multiple 17 Kd to
26 Kd bands, representing different post-translational
modification and maturation stages of IL-24 protein
(Figure 1A). However, IL-24mt-expressing cells showed
a single 19–20 Kd protein band, suggesting that
phosphorylation regulates IL-24 protein maturation.
We used immunoprecipitation to determine the
phosphorylation status of IL-24wt and IL-24mt protein.
We detected 26 Kd bands in sample lysates prepared
from IL-24wt-expressing cells, reflecting IL-24wt protein
(Figure 1B). No 26 Kd band was observed in lysates
prepared from IL-24mt-expressing cells, indicating that
IL-24mt protein is not phosphorylated.
Since exogenous IL-24wt protein expression is
detectable in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), and secretory organelles [3, 13, 14], we

protein banding patterns differed following DOX treatment of H1299-IL-24wt and H1299-IL-24mt cells. Cells that did not receive DOX
treatment served as controls. B. Cell lysates from DOX-treated H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt were immunoprecipitated (IP) with
phosphorylated Serine or Threonine antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with human IL-24 antibody. IL-24 protein was detected in H1299IL-24mt cell lysate, but not in H1299-IL-24mt cell lysate. This shows that only wild-type IL-24 protein is phosphorylated. IgG protein band
served as internal protein loading control. C. Immunofluorescence studies showed that IL-24wt protein was uniformly distributed in the
cytoplasm, with some localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cell. In contrast, IL-24mt protein was mostly localized in the ER,
with little distributed in the cytoplasm of the cell. Magnification, x100. D. IL-24 protein level was markedly low in the culture supernatant
collected from DOX-treated H1299-IL24mt cells compared with the IL-24 protein level in the supernatant from DOX-treated H1299-IL24wt
cells, as determined by ELISA. Cell culture supernatant from untreated cells served as a negative control. The number above the bar
indicates the protein concentration (ng/ml). E. Expression of IL-24wt following DOX treatment greatly reduced cell viability of H1299 cells,
compared with cells expressing IL-24mt at 72 h. F. A colony formation assay on soft agar demonstrated that H1299-IL-24wt cells formed
fewer colonies than H1299-IL-24mt when treated with DOX. G. Cell cycle analysis showed that only IL-24wt induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest
at 48 h after DOX treatment. H. IL-24wt activated caspase-9, PARP and pJNKThr183/Tyr185 in H1299 cells at 48 h after DOX treatment, while
IL-24mt did not. Beta actin was detected as protein loading control. *denotes P < 0.05. “NS” denotes Not Significant.

cell viability assays to determine whether modification
of the phosphorylation sites in IL-24wt influences its
ability to inhibit growth. IL-24wt-expressing H1299 cells
were significantly less viable than IL-24mt-expressing
cells (P < 0.05; Figure 1E). We also conducted colony
formation assays on soft agar. IL-24wt expression inhibited
cell growth, with fewer IL-24wt-expressing cell colonies
than controls (25% reduction; Figure 1F). In contrast,
IL-24mt-expressing H1299 cells had slightly more
colonies than controls (Figure 1F).

We next performed a Matrigel assay, which mimics
the invasive process of tumor cells travelling through
basement membrane components. A significant reduction
in cell invasion was observed only in IL-24wt-expressing
cells (P = 0.001; Figure 2C). These results demonstrate
that phosphorylation is required for IL-24-mediated
inhibition of tumor cell migration and invasion.

IL-24wt induces cell cycle arrest

We investigated the signaling mechanism by
which IL-24 phosphorylation regulates its anti-tumor
activity. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis
[21, 22] on IL-24wt and IL-24mt cell lysates indicated
different expression levels of proteins involved in the
AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
(data not shown). Thus, we investigated the regulation
of the AKT-mTOR pathway by IL-24. Induction of
IL-24wt in H1299-IL24wt cells significantly decreased
pAKTS473 protein expression at 24 h and 48 h (Figure 3A).
Expression of a critical downstream target of AKT,
pPRAS40T246, was also reduced upon IL-24wt induction
(Figure 3A). Furthermore, IL-24wt markedly reduced
pmTORS2448 expression at 24 and 48 h (Figure 3A).
The expression of IL-24mt protein in H1299-IL24
cells produced no change in pAKTS473 expression at
24  h (Figure 3A). However, we observed significantly
increased expression at 48 h (P < 0.05; Figure 3A).
pPRAS40T246 expression increased at 24 h and 48 h, while
pmTORS2448 expression only increased at 24 h.
We further evaluated the effect of IL-24
phosphorylation on pAKTT308 expression and on AKT
isoforms AKT1 and 2. AKT1 and 2 are ubiquitously
expressed and individually contribute to cell
survival, proliferation, and metastasis via different
mechanisms [23]. In IL-24wt-expressing cells, we
observed a marked reduction in pAKTT308, pAKT1S473, and
pAKT2S474 expression at 48 h, compared with controls.
IL-24mt expression increased pAKTT308 and pAKT2S474,
with no change in pAKT1S473, suggesting that IL-24
phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of AKT
isomers (Figure 3B).

IL-24wt inhibits the AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway

Previous studies reported that IL-24wt expression in
cancer cells results in cell cycle arrest, leading to apoptosis
[3, 5, 17]. We therefore investigated whether IL-24wt and
IL-24mt expression perturbed cell cycle progression in
H1299 cells. IL-24wt expression increased the number of
cells in the G2/M phase (9.3%) compared with controls
(3.65%; Figure 1G). IL-24mt expression decreased the
number of cells in the G2/M phase (3.4%) compared
with controls (8.05%). These results demonstrate that
phosphorylation is required for IL-24wt-mediated G2/Mphase cell-cycle inhibition.

IL-24wt activates caspase-9, PARP, and JNK
Our studies and others have demonstrated that
adenovirus (Ad)-IL-24 induces apoptosis in cancer
cells by activating caspase-9, poly (ADP ribose)
polymerase (PARP), and JNK [3, 17–19]. In the present
study, we determined the status of these proteins in
IL-24wt- and IL-24mt-expressing H1299 cells. We
observed activated caspase-9, PARP, and phosphorylated
(p) JNKThr183/Tyr185 only in IL-24wt-expressing cells,
indicating that phosphorylation is required for the proapoptotic activity of IL-24 (Figure 1H).

IL-24wt inhibits tumor cell migration and
cell invasion
We previously demonstrated that lung cancer cells
expressing exogenous wild-type IL-24 migrate and invade
less [20]. Here, we performed a scratch assay to evaluate
whether cell migration and invasion were altered by
modification of the phosphorylation sites in IL-24wt cells.
IL-24wt-expressing cells migrated into 26.5% of
the scratched area, whereas IL-24mt-expressing cells
migrated into 94% of the scratched area (Figure 2A).
To further confirm that lack of IL-24 phosphorylation
abrogates the inhibition of cell migration, cell migration
assays were performed. IL-24wt expression reduced tumor
cell migration, compared with controls, at 24 h and 48 h
(P = 0.01; Figure 2B). IL-24mt-expressing cells also
migrated less than controls, although to a lesser degree
than IL-24wt-expressing cells (Figure 2B).

IL-24 mediates anti-tumor activity by
suppressing AKT and AKT-mediated
PRAS40 phosphorylation
To evaluate whether IL-24 mediates its anti-tumor
function by inhibiting AKT activation and phosphorylation
is required for AKT inhibition, we knocked down
AKT in H1299-IL-24 cells with si-AKT. pAKTS473
expression and cell migration were significantly lower in
IL-24wt-expressing cells than controls (Figure 4A, 4B).
Si-AKT knockdown mimicked the effect of IL-24wt

compared with the individual treatments (Figure 4A, 4B).

H1299-IL-24wt and H1299-IL-24mt cells were analyzed for proteins associated with the AKT signaling pathway and changes in protein
expression quantified by Western blotting. A. IL-24wt, but not IL-24mt, significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated (p) AKTS473,
pPRAS40T246, and pmTORS2448 proteins at the two time points tested. B. Analysis for changes in the expression of AKT isoforms demonstrated
that IL-24wt significantly reduced the expression of pAKTT308, pAKT1S473, and pAKT2S474. Increased expression of all of the AKT isoforms

mTORS2448 expression in myr-AKT-expressing cells
compared with vector controls (Figure 4C). However,
we observed no noticeable IL-24wt-mediated inhibition
of AKT or its downstream signaling proteins in myrAKT-expressing cells. Furthermore, expression of myr-AKT
abrogated the IL-24wt-mediated inhibition of cell migration
compared with IL-24wt-mediated inhibition in the absence
of myr-AKT (P < 0.05; Figure 4D). Our results confirm that
the regulation of AKT signaling and phosphorylation are
crucial for IL-24wt to produce anti-tumor effects.
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 at
Threonine (T) 246 inactivates PRAS40 and influences

H1299-IL-24wt cells (Figure 4A, 4B). IL-24mt, unlike
IL-24wt, showed reduced cell migration inhibition
compared with controls. The combination of treatment
inhibited cell migration more than the individual treatments
did. Together, our data show that IL-24wt mediates its antitumor activity by regulating AKT, and, importantly, that
IL-24wt must be phosphorylated to regulate AKT.
We also examined whether IL-24wt could mediate its
tumor suppressor effects when AKT was overexpressed.
Constitutive AKT expression was achieved by transfecting
H1299-IL24wt cells with myr-AKT plasmid. We observed
significantly increased pAKTS473, pPRAS40T246, and

H1299-IL-24wt and H1299-IL-24mt cells were transfected with AKT siRNA, or not transfected, followed by treatment with or without DOX
(1 μg/ml). Then, cells were subjected to molecular analysis at 48 h after DOX treatment. A. Western blotting showed that IL-24wt plus AKT
siRNA produced a greater inhibitory effect on pAKTS473 expression than IL-24mt plus siAKT. B. Cell migration assay results correlated
with Western blotting and showed that IL-24wt plus siAKT produced inhibited cell migration more than IL-24mt plus siAKT. C. H1299IL-24wt cells were either not transfected, or transfected with myr-AKT plasmid, followed by treatment with or without DOX (1 μg/ml) and
subjected to molecular analysis at 48 h after treatment. Expression of myr-AKT abrogated the inhibitory effect of IL-24wt on AKT and its
downstream targets, PRAS40 and mTOR. D. IL-24wt-mediated inhibition of cell migration was reduced when myr-AKT was expressed.
E. Phosphorylation of PRAS40T246 and AKTS473 was significantly reduced in IL-24wt-expressing and PRAS40mt-expressing cells compared

Control cells did not receive any treatment. Beta actin was detected as protein loading control. *denotes P < 0.05. “NS” denotes Not Significant.

mTOR activation [24]. Our myr-AKT study results
concurred with this report. We used PRAS40mt plasmid
to further test whether reduced PRAS40 expression in
IL-24wt-expressing cells occurs via AKT. The plasmid
expresses PRAS40 protein, in which the T is replaced
with Alanine (A) at amino acid 246 (T246A), such
that AKT cannot phosphorylate PRAS40, resulting in
reduced pPRAS40 expression and mTOR activation.
We anticipated that induction of IL-24wt, along with
mutated PRAS40 expression, would show greater
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reduction in pPRAS40 expression. PPRAS40T246
expression was significantly reduced in mutant
PRAS40T246A plasmid-transfected cells compared with
controls (P < 0.05; Figure 4E). However, pPRAS40
expression was further reduced when combined with
IL-24wt, comparable to our findings from cells
expressing IL-24wt alone (Figure 4E). Our results show
that IL-24wt inhibits AKT-mediated phosphorylation
and PRAS40 inactivation to execute its anti-tumor
activity.

IL-24wt modulates PRAS40-Raptor interaction

kinase 1 (PAK1) are also downstream targets of AKT.
Expression of pFLNaS2152 and its downstream target
pPAK1T423 were significantly reduced in IL-24wt-expressing
cells (Figure 6). However, IL-24mt-expressing cells exhibited
significant reduction of pβ- cateninS33/37/T41, and increased
cyclin D1, pFLNaS2152, and pPAK1T423, with no change in
pGSK-3S21/9 protein expression, compared with controls
(Figure 6). Our results demonstrate that only IL-24wt
effectively inhibits AKT and its downstream target proteins.

AKT is known to inactivate PRAS40 via
phosphorylation, thereby disrupting PRAS40-mTORC1
binding and removing PRAS40 inhibition of mTORC1
[24, 25]. PRAS40 binds to mTORC1 primarily through
interactions with Raptor. Our results showed that IL-24wt
expression reduced AKT-mediated PRAS40 inactivation.
IL-24wt expression might, then, increase PRAS40
inhibition of mTORC1 by increasing the tight interaction
between PRAS40 and Raptor. To test this, we treated
H1299-IL24wt cells with DOX for 48 h. The cytosolic
extracts were immunoprecipitated with PRAS40 and
immunoblotted for Raptor. We observed a marked
reduction in Raptor binding to PRAS40 upon IL-24wt
induction (Figure 5A). Similar results were observed
in H1299-IL24wt cells that were treated with mTORC1
inhibitor rapamycin (100 nM) for 48 h (Figure 5B),
suggesting that IL-24wt functions similarly to rapamycin
in inhibiting mTORC1.

DISCUSSION
Protein phosphorylation is a common PTM in
mammalian cells, playing a crucial role in regulating
protein functions [16, 26]. Upon phosphorylation, proteins
regulate critical cellular processes, such as the cell cycle,
apoptosis, signal transduction, metabolism, survival,
proliferation, and development [16, 26, 27]. In this study,
we investigated whether phosphorylation of IL-24 is
critical for anti-tumor activity. For this, we generated
DOX-inducible H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells.
We chose H1299 cells because these cells do not express
endogenous IL-24 protein and lack IL-24 receptors [6, 13].
Thus, any anti-tumor activity observed against H1299
cells would be solely attributable to the exogenous IL-24
that is expressed intracellularly when induced by DOX
and not confounded by secreted IL-24 [6, 13].
We demonstrated for the first time that lack of
IL-24 phosphorylation affects its subcellular localization,

IL-24wt alters the expression of downstream
targets of AKT
We next determined the expression of proteins that
are downstream of AKT in H1299 cells after induction
of IL-24wt/mt protein expression. IL-24wt significantly
reduced pGSK-3S21/9 and cyclin D1 and markedly increased
pβ-cateninS33/37/T41 expression, compared with controls
(Figure 6). Filamin A (FLNa) and p21-activated

Figure 5: IL-24wt modulates PRAS40 and Raptor interaction. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Raptor protein bound

to PRAS40 was markedly reduced in A. IL-24wt-expressing cells and B. rapamycin-treated cells, compared with untreated controls. Total
proteins for Raptor, PRAS40, and mTOR were detected in cell lysates to ensure that the reduced Raptor binding was not due to a reduction
in total protein levels. Beta actin was detected as protein loading control.

secretion, and anti-tumor activity (Figures 1 and 2).
Further, transient transfection studies revealed that our
results were not cell-type-specific or attributable to the use
of stable clones (Supplementary Figure 1). Other tumor
suppressor proteins, including p53, LKB1, and von HippelLindau proteins, require phosphorylation to function
[28–31]. Similarly, phosphorylation of the herpes simplex
virus type 1 ICP0 protein is necessary for its subcellular
localization and efficient function [32]. Phosphorylation
is also known to regulate protein secretion. Oh et al. [33]
demonstrated that HMGB1phosphorylation is critical for
HMGB1 protein secretion.
Functional studies showed that only IL-24wt
significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation,
induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest, and activated caspase-9,
PARP, and JNK, indicating that phosphorylation is required
for IL-24 to exert anti-tumor effects (Figure 1). Zhao et al.
[34] showed that AMPK protein phosphorylation was
essential for inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of
cell proliferation and colony formation in nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells. Similarly, stress-activated protein kinases
(SAPK)-mediated phosphorylation of p53 induces nuclear
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p53 accumulation and transcriptional activation of
proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [35].
These findings are consistent with our results showing
that subcellular localization, protein secretion, and the
tumor-suppressive function of IL-24 is modulated by
phosphorylation.
Tumor cell migration and invasion play important
roles in lung cancer progression and metastasis [36]. We
and others have shown that IL-24 inhibits metastasis by
inhibiting cell migration and invasion [20]. Therefore,
we focused on investigating the importance of IL-24
phosphorylation in the inhibition of migration and invasion
of H1299-IL24 cells in vitro. Migration and invasion were
significantly reduced only in IL-24wt-expressing cells
(Figure 2). Consistent with our data, phosphorylation of
the human estrogen receptor-beta at Serine 105 resulted
in inhibition of breast cancer cell migration and invasion
[37]. Our data reveal that IL-24 phosphorylation is
important for its anti-metastatic function.
We next determined the molecular signaling
mechanism by which IL-24mt and IL-24wt differed. The
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is associated with the
16279

development of human cancers, including lung cancer
[38]. AKT is an essential downstream component of PI3Kmediated oncogenic signaling and provides critical cell
survival signals for tumor progression by phosphorylating
several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and proapoptotic factors [38]. Studies showed that pharmacologic
and biological inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling
suppressed cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis
[38]. In parallel, we previously reported that IL-24 can
negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in
Ad-IL24-transduced lung and breast cancer cells [39].
Consistent with these reports, only IL-24wt significantly
inhibited the expression of AKT isoforms and their
downstream signaling proteins (Figure 3). Studies using
si-AKT and myr-AKT plasmid DNA demonstrated that
IL-24wt specifically inhibits AKT (Figure 4A, 4B). This
inhibition activated PRAS40, as evidenced by its reduced
phosphorylation at Threonine 246 residue, and mTOR
inhibition. AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation at
Threonine 246 promotes PRAS40 binding to 14-3-3
protein complex, thereby weakening PRAS40 interaction
with mTORC1, resulting in mTOR activation [25]. Further
evidence for the involvement of PRAS40 in AKT/mTOR
pathway inhibition was demonstrated using PRAS40T246A
plasmid DNA (Figure 4E).
In the absence of nutrients, PRAS40 binds to
Raptor and inhibits mTOR kinase activity by blocking
TOR signaling (TOS)-mediated substrate access to
Raptor [25, 40]. Since IL-24wt relieved PRAS40 from
AKT inhibition, indicated by reduced pPRAS40T246
expression, we examined whether activated PRAS40
further interacted with Raptor to inhibit mTORC1. We
observed less interaction between PRAS40 and Raptor in
IL-24wt-expressing H1299 cells than in controls
(Figure 5A). To determine whether our observation was
common among the agents that disrupt mTOR, we tested
rapamycin on H1299-IL24wt cells and observed reduced
interaction between PRAS40 and Raptor in rapamycintreated cells, compared with controls (Figure 5B). While
we might speculate that IL-24wt likely disrupts the mTOR
complex, additional studies investigating the molecular
mechanism are warranted.
Finally, we investigated the expression of proteins
that are molecular targets of and regulated by AKT.
Only IL-24wt reduced the phosphorylation of GSK-3 and
increased β-catenin phosphorylation (Figure 6). GSK-3
and β-catenin regulate cellular processes and are often
deregulated in cancer [41]. The ability of IL-24wt to
modulate GSK-3 and β-catenin concurs with our previous
report demonstrating that Ad-mediated IL-24 expression
in breast cancer cells reduced the expression of these
proteins [39]. The expression of cyclin D1, a cell-cycle
regulator and a target gene of β-catenin, is increased in
lung cancer and correlated with increased risk of tumor
progression and metastasis [42, 43]. In the present study,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

only IL-24wt reduced cyclin D1 expression (Figure 6).
The ability of IL-24wt to markedly inhibit β-catenin and
cyclin D1 expression and activate GSK-3, determined by
its phosphorylation, makes IL-24-based cancer therapy
attractive.
Recent studies have shown that cyclin D1
interacts with and regulates FLNa expression in
migrating breast cancer cells [44]. FLNa is a widely
expressed molecular scaffold protein that organizes
filamentous actin into networks and stress fibers [45],
is involved in cell motility and invasion [46], and is
frequently overexpressed in cancers, including lung
cancer [46]. SiRNA-mediated knock-down of cyclin
D1 reduced phosphorylation of FLNa at Ser2152
and Ser1459, resulting in reduced cell migration and
invasion [44].
FLNa is also regulated by PAK1 [47]. PAKs play an
important role in cellular processes, including cytoskeletal
rearrangements and growth and apoptotic signal
transduction through mitogen-activated protein kinases
[47]. PAK1 phosphorylation at Threonine 423 by PDK1
is associated with an increase in phosphorylation of PAK1
substrates, including FLNa at Serine 2152 [48]. Physical
interaction of FLNa with PAK1 has been shown to enhance
PAK1 kinase activity, which subsequently phosphorylates
FLNa at Serine 2152 [47, 48]. This bidirectional PAK1/
FLNa interaction has been demonstrated to influence actin
cytoskeletal structures and enhance tumor cell migration.
Finally, PAK1 has been reported to be regulated by AKT
and regulate chemotaxis [48]. Our study indicated that
only IL-24wt reduced pFLNaS2152and pPAK1T423 expression,
coinciding with reduced AKT and cyclin D1 (Figure 6).
We did not, however, analyze for cyclin B1, which has
also been shown to regulate FLNa [49]. To our knowledge,
this is the first report demonstrating that IL-24 protein
phosphorylation is critical for modulating the AKT/
mTOR signaling axis and exerting its anti-tumor activities
in lung cancer. Whether IL-24-mediated inhibition
occurs via the AKT/mTOR pathway in human cancers of
different origins is unknown and should be investigated.
Additionally, all of the experiments in this study were
performed in a receptor-negative H1299 lung cancer cell
line. Thus, the role of phosphorylation in IL-24 cytokine
function in immune cells remains unexplored. Finally, the
contribution of protein phosphorylation on IL-24 protein
stability is not known and is currently being investigated
in the laboratory.
In
conclusion,
we
demonstrated
that
IL-24 phosphorylation is essential for its anti-cancer
properties. IL-24 is the only IL-10 cytokine family
member whose functions are regulated by PTMs,
analogous to classical tumor suppressors. Our results
provide a platform for identifying the phosphorylation
site(s) that are critical for IL-24 to function as an
anti-cancer drug.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

On the basis of wild-type IL-24wt cDNA sequence,
IL-24 phosphorylation mutant (IL-24mt) plasmid was
generated by replacing the three serine (S) and two
threonine (T) sites using the forward and reverse PCR
primers (Table 1) and the “Overlay PCR” method. The
primers designed (Table 1) for creating the IL-24mt was
such that the amino acid replacing the native amino acid
in MDA-7/IL24 protein had equivalent size, structural
similarity, charge and polarity. In the “Overlay PCR”
method, the forward primer was designed such that the
intended one or two or three nucleotides which are to be
replaced were flanked on each side with approximately
20 oligonucleotide bases. The forward primer was used
in conjunction with a complementing reverse primer. The
forward primer for a mutant is paired with a next 3′ reverse
primer for a high fidelity PCR reaction; the reverse primer
is paired with previous 5′ forward primer in a high fidelity
PCR reaction. Then the two segments of PCR products,
which share approximately 40 bases together (so-called
overlay), are used as templates for overlaying both
segments together using previous 5′ forward primer and
next 3′ reverse primer. The resulting PCR product with
all five phosphorylation site replaced was subsequently
TA cloned into TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and
sequenced at the DNA sequencing core facility (MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
The IL-24wt and IL-24mt cDNA from the TOPO
plasmid vector was sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1+ plasmid
expression vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmids
were verified by BamHI-XhoI restriction enzyme
digestion, PCR, and by the inserted signature restriction
enzyme digestion. All PCR reactions performed in the
study followed the High Fidelity PCR system protocol

Cell culture
We cultured human non-small cell lung cancer cells
(H1299) in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) as previously
described [4, 6]. The cell line was authenticated at the
Genetic Resource Core Resource Facility, Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD. In all experiments, untreated
cells served as controls.

IL-24 plasmid vectors and cell lines
MDA-7/IL-24 (GenBank accession NM_006850,
variant 1) cDNA is 621 bp in size with 206 amino acids.
Potential phosphorylation sites of MDA-7/IL-24 protein
predicted by NIH NCBI ORF finder are S88, S101, T111,
T133 and S161 where S stands for Serine; T stands for
Threonine. The software predicted that phosphorylation
in MDA-7/IL-24 are as following: amino acid 88 SAR,
amino acid 133 TLK, amino acid 161 SIR are casein
kinase II consensus sites; amino acid 101 SDAE, amino
acid 111 TLLE, amino acid 161 SIRD are protein kinase C
(PKC) consensus sites [50].
Human IL-24wt cDNA cloned in pLJ143 plasmid
backbone was used as a template to create the IL-24
phosphorylation mutant (IL-24mt). Briefly, IL-24wt cDNA
was retrieved by BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme
digestion and ligated back into to pBlueScript SK+
(Agilent). The sequence was verified by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using primers MDA-7.F.BamHI (forward
primer) and MDA7.R.XhoI (reverse primer; Table 1) and
confirmed by DNA sequencing from T7 and M13R.

purchased from New England Biolabs. The pcDNA3.1+
plasmid vector carrying IL-24wt and IL-24mt cDNA
sequence were either used in transient transfection studies
or used in creating doxycycline (DOX)-inducible plasmid
vector as described below.

continued for fourteen days at 37°C, with culture medium
replenished twice a week. The number of surviving
colonies was determined by staining with 0.005% crystal
violet. Colonies were photographed and counted.

Tet-ON inducible IL-24 expression in H1299
lung cancer cell line

H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (1 × 105)
seeded in six-well plates were treated with DOX (1 μg/ml).
Untreated cells served as controls. Cells were collected
at 48 h after treatment and subject to flow-cytometric
analysis as previously described [6, 17].

Cell cycle analysis

The Tet-ON inducible system was purchased
from Clontech. The IL-24wt and IL-24mt cDNA sequence
cloned in pcDNA3.1+ plasmid vector was retrieved
by BamHI and PmeI restriction enzyme digestion
and sub-cloned into BamHI and EcoRV enzyme
digested pTRE-Tight plasmid (Clontech). The resulting
pTre-IL24wt and pTre-IL24mt plasmids with appropriate
inserts were verified by PCR, restriction enzyme
digestions and signature enzyme digestions. The plasmids
were subsequently used for creating Tet-ON inducible
stable cell lines per manufacturer’s guidelines. Briefly,
human H1299 lung cancer cell line was transfected
with pTet-ON-adv plasmid (Clontech) using Fugene
(Roche) and selected in Neomycin (800 μg/ml; Sigma)
for fourteen days. Transfection studies were performed
using 10% tetracycline free fetal bovine serum (Atlanta
Biologicals). The surviving fraction of cells was replated
and transfected with pTreT-IL-24wt or pTreT-IL-24mt
plasmid followed by hygromycin (400 μg/ml; Sigma)
for two weeks. The surviving fraction of cells were then
expanded and screened for IL-24wt and IL-24mt expression
by Western blotting after DOX (1 μg/ml) treatment
for 24 h. The IL-24wt and IL-24mt expressing cells were
then seeded in ninety-six-well plates and subjected to
single-cell cloning. Each clonal population of cells was
subsequently screened for IL-24 protein expression by
Western blotting. The clone that demonstrated the highest
IL-24wt and IL-24mt protein expression was expanded and
labeled as H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt respectively
and used in all of the studies described herein.

Western blotting assay
H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (1 × 105/well)
seeded in six-well plates were trypsinized and collected at
24 h and/or at 48 h after DOX (1 μg/ml). Cell lysates were
prepared and protein samples subjected to western blotting
[6, 11, 17]. Primary antibodies against IL-24 (Introgen
Therapeutics), pAKTS473, pAKTT308, AKT, pAKT1S473,
AKT1, pAKT2S474, AKT2, pPRAS40T246, PRAS40,

PAK1, pJNKThr183/Tyr185, JNK, cyclin D1, caspase-9, and
PARP (Cell Signaling) were purchased and used. Betaactin (Sigma) was used as an internal loading control.
Proteins were detected using the appropriate secondary
antibodies, as previously described [6, 11, 17, 39]. Protein
expression levels were quantified using Image Quant
(Syngene) software.

Immunoprecipitation assay
Cells (5 × 106) actively growing in 150-mm tissue
culture plates were treated with DOX (1 μg/ml). Fortyeight hours after treatment, the cells were washed and
trypsinized, and total cell lysates prepared. About 500 μg
of total protein was mixed with 100 μl of appropriate
antibody (phospho-Serine, phospho-Threonine, PRAS40;
Cell Signaling) and incubated at 4°C overnight with
constant mixing. Immune complexes were captured by
incubation with 75–100 μl protein A/G-coated agarose
beads for 1 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated proteins
were recovered by boiling the agarose beads in 2X SDS
sample buffer and western blotting. The membrane
was subsequently probed using the appropriate primary
antibody (IL-24, Raptor), and the protein bands detected
as previously described [6, 17].

Cell viability assay
H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (1 − 2 × 105
cells/well) seeded in six-well plates were treated with
DOX (1 μg/ml). The number of viable cells at 72 h
after DOX treatment was determined by the trypan-blue
exclusion assay method as described previously [6, 17].

Colony-forming assay

Immunofluorescence assay

H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (2 × 104) were
mixed with 0.7% low-melting agarose and seeded in sixwell tissue culture plates previously coated with 0.7%
agarose. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then,
the cells were treated with DOX (1 μg/ml). Incubation

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C and
subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After fixation,
the cells were washed with PBS, incubated with
100% methanol for 10 min, and permeabilized with
0.5% TritonX-100 for 10 min. The cells were washed
with PBS, followed by incubation in blocking buffer
(3% BSA + 1% normal serum) in PBS for 1 h at RT.
Then, we added a mixture of anti-human IL-24 antibody
raised in goat (5.0 μl; Introgen Therapeutics) and mouse
anti-PDI antibody (0.5 μl; Molecular Probes) in blocking
buffer and incubated for 2 h at RT. The cells were
subsequently washed with 0.5 ml of 1X blocking buffer,
followed by the addition of a mixture of Alexa Fluor®
488 (anti-mouse green) and Alexa Fluor® 594 (anti-goat
red) diluted in 1 ml of blocking buffer. The cells were
incubated in the dark for 1 h at RT, then counter stained
with DAPI (Sigma) for 1 min. The stained cells were
washed with 1X PBS, mounted with Dako cytomation
fluorescent mounting media (Dako), and then viewed
using a laser confocal microscope equipped with
appropriate fluorescein filters.

The in vitro scratch assay was performed using the
CytoselectTM 24-well wound healing assay (Cell Biolabs).
Briefly, H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (2.5 × 104)
were added to 24-well plates with inserts in place. After
24 h incubation, we removed the inserts to generate a
0.9 mm wound field, washed it with media, and incubated at
37°C. The cells were then treated with DOX (1 μg/ml). We
photographed the scratch area 24 h later using a Nikon TiU
microscope (Nikon). The distances between the two cell
edges were measured per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell migration assay
H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (5 × 104)
suspended in 1 ml RPMI-1460 medium were seeded in
the upper chambers (8 μm; BD Biosciences) and placed in
a six-well plate filled with serum-free RPMI-1640 medium
(lower chamber). After 24 h, the culture medium was
replaced with fresh medium containing 20% tetracyclinefree FBS (Atlanta Biologicals). The upper chamber was
filled with 2% tetracycline-free FBS-containing medium,
with or without DOX (1 μg/ml; Sigma). Following
incubation for 24 h and 48 h, the inserts were removed
and processed as previously described [20, 51, 52]. Four
random fields were selected and we counted the migrated
cells per field under an inverted bright-field microscope
at 10X magnification. The results were expressed as the
average number of cells of four fields.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt cells (1 × 104)
seeded in six-well plates were incubated overnight at
37°C, 5% CO2. The next day, the culture medium was
replaced with fresh RPMI-1640 medium containing
2% FBS. DOX (1 μg/ml) was added. Culture supernatants
were collected at different times after treatment,
centrifuged, and stored at -80°C. We detected IL-24
protein in the supernatant by sandwich ELISA (R&D
Systems). Briefly, ninety-six well flat-bottomed plates
were coated with 100 μl of anti-IL-24 capture antibody
(2.0 μg/mL; R&D Systems) overnight at +4°C. The plates
were washed with sterile PBS followed by incubation in
100 μl of blocking buffer containing 10% bovine serum
albumin (BSA in PBS) for 1 h at RT. On completion of
incubation, the blocking buffer was aspirated and 100 μl
of culture supernatant collected from H1299-IL24wt and
H1299-IL24mt cells with and without DOX treatment was
diluted in PBS (1:2) and added in duplicate wells and
incubated for 2 h at RT. The culture medium from the
wells was subsequently aspirated and washed with sterile
PBS. To the wells 100 μl of horse-radish peroxide (HRP)conjugated anti-IL-24 detection antibody (R&D Systems)
was added. After 1 h incubation, the wells were washed
with sterile PBS followed by addition of streptavidinhorse radish peroxidase (100 μl/well) and incubation in
the dark for 20 min at RT. The reaction was stopped by
adding 50 μl of stop solution (R&D Systems). The plates
were then read using a plate reader equipped with 450 nm
excitation and 540 nm emission filter.

Cell invasion assay
The cell invasion assay was performed using sixwell Matrigel invasion chambers with 8-μm pore inserts
(BD Biosciences). H1299-IL24wt and H1299-IL24mt
(5 × 104) cells were seeded into the upper chambers. The
lower chambers were filled with serum-free medium. After
24 h, the medium was replaced with 20% FBS-containing
culture medium, and the upper chambers were filled with
2% FBS-containing culture medium, with or without DOX
(1 μg/ml). After an additional 24 h and 48 h incubation,
the filters were removed and processed as previously
described [20, 51, 52]. Tumor cell invasiveness was
determined by counting cells in four microscopic fields per
well. The extent of invasion was expressed as an average
number of cells per field.

RNA interference studies
H1299-IL24 (wt and mt) cells (1 × 105 cells/well)
were seeded in serum-free medium in six-well plates and
transfected with 100 nM AKT siRNA (Santa Cruz) using
transfection reagent (Dharmacon), per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Six hours later, the medium was replaced with
