BACKGROUND: Palliative chemotherapy is aimed at increasing survival and palliating symptoms. However, the
response rate to first-line chemotherapy in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is less than 30%. Experimental studies have shown that supplementation with fish oil (FO) can increase chemotherapy efficacy without negatively affecting nontarget tissue. This study evaluated whether the combination of FO and chemotherapy
(carboplatin with vinorelbine or gemcitabine) provided a benefit over standard of care (SOC) on response rate and
clinical benefit from chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. METHODS: Forty-six patients completed the
study, n ¼ 31 in the SOC group and n ¼ 15 in the FO group (2.5 g EPA þ DHA/day). Response to chemotherapy was
determined by clinical examination and imaging. Response rate was defined as the sum of complete response plus
partial response, and clinical benefit was defined as the sum of complete response, partial response, and stable disease divided by the number of patients. Toxicities were graded by a nurse before each chemotherapy cycle. Survival
was calculated 1 year after study enrollment. RESULTS: Patients in the FO group had an increased response rate and
greater clinical benefit compared with the SOC group (60.0% vs 25.8%, P ¼ .008; 80.0% vs 41.9%, P ¼ .02, respectively). The incidence of dose-limiting toxicity did not differ between groups (P ¼ .46). One-year survival tended to
be greater in the FO group (60.0% vs 38.7%; P ¼ .15). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, supplementation with FO
results in increased chemotherapy efficacy without affecting the toxicity profile and may contribute to increased

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in Western countries.1 The majority of patients with lung cancers present with advanced-stage disease for which standard treatment consists of palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Efficacy of chemotherapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is low with large trials of different chemotherapy combinations reporting response rates below 30%.2-4 The effectiveness of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC has
reached a plateau, with little improvement in response rates, and it has been suggested that research should focus on new
approaches and novel treatments rather than different combinations of chemotherapy drugs.5
Experimental studies in a variety of tumor types using several different chemotherapy agents including anthracyclines, cisplatin, irinotecan, and alkylating agents have reported greater efficacy of chemotherapy when fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA 20:5 n-3 and docosahexaenoic acid, DHA 22:6 n-3) is added to the diet or cell medium.6-10 The
mechanisms of action of these antineoplastic agents vary, suggesting that fish oil modulates chemotherapy response via
diverse mechanisms (see Biondo et al11 and Baracos et al12 for reviews). EPA and DHA may also have antitumor effects
including inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis12; however, the specific mechanisms behind these effects have not
been elucidated. Regardless of the exact mechanisms, these studies suggest that fish oil (FO) has potential as an effective
adjuvant to chemotherapy treatment.

Fish Oil and Chemotherapy Response/Murphy et al

Current treatment of advanced NSCLC is nonspecific and toxic, typically consisting of platinum-based
regimens such as carboplatin in combination with vinorelbine or gemcitabine. Efficacy is dose-dependant and
limited by gastrointestinal, hematological, and cardiac
toxicities. Treatment approaches that enhance cytotoxicity of anticancer agents to tumor cells while minimizing
toxicity to nontarget tissue have the potential to increase
benefits of chemotherapy including disease control and
survival. Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy appears to
be specific to tumor tissue as evinced by lack of additional
toxicity to nontumor tissues after the addition of dietary
EPA and DHA.13 There is also evidence that dietary FO
enrichment may have a protective effect on nontumor tissue including minimization of gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity.13,14 However, many experimental
studies have used amounts of fish oil that are beyond concentrations achievable in humans, even with supplementation, and only 1 study in humans has been conducted.15
We aimed to expand upon the base of information
on fish oil, chemotherapy efficacy, and treatment-related
toxicity. This is the first study to evaluate the ability of
fish oil to improve chemotherapy efficacy in patients with
lung cancer. We hypothesized that supplementation with
fish oil during first-line chemotherapy for lung cancer
would increase response rates without significantly affecting chemotherapy toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was approved by the Alberta Health Services
Research Ethics Board. Study accrual occurred during a 2year period, 2007-2009. Written, informed consent was
obtained from all patients. This study is part of a larger
open-label trial that was focused on nutritional status during chemotherapy in which 60 NSCLC patients receiving
first-line chemotherapy consented to either 1) nutritional
intervention with FO or 2) standard of care (SOC, no
intervention). The subset described here was chosen on
the basis of treatment intent (palliative vs adjuvant) to
standardize the type of chemotherapy treatment patients
received. Detailed rationale, study design, and analysis of
the effect of fish oil supplementation on body composition in a partly overlapping subset of these patients has
been published.16 In brief, patients with advanced lung
cancer who were newly referred to the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) were given an information sheet detailing available nutritional studies. Patients

indicated their interest and were approached to participate
accordingly. This study was designed as an open-label trial
with a contemporary control group to facilitate enrollment
and study adherence. Patient interest in placebo-controlled
studies is low, as this is a vulnerable patient population
with an expected survival of less than 2 years.
Patients on the FO arm were offered a choice of 2
formats of supplementation: 1) 4 1-g gelatin capsules per
day containing 2.2 g EPA and 240 mg DHA or 2) 7.5 mL
liquid fish oil per day (2.2 g EPA and 500 mg DHA). The
number of capsules or the amount of liquid remaining at
the end of the study was measured to determine compliance. Capsules were provided in kind by Ocean Nutrition
Canada (Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada). Liquid fish
oil was purchased from NutraSea (Ascenta Health,
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada). These companies
were not privy to the results of this study and did not
influence the study conclusions.
Patient Eligibility
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of stage IIIB or IV
NSCLC who were chemotherapy-naive were eligible for
enrollment. Stage of disease was based on the American
Joint Committee on Cancer stage groupings.17 Patients
had consented to receive first-line platinum-based
doublet chemotherapy of palliative intent consisting of
either carboplatin with vinorelbine or carboplatin with
gemcitabine. Additional criteria included ability to
maintain oral intake and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 2 as assessed
by a physician.
The majority of plasma n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are
carried in phospholipids, which reflect the amount of
EPA and DHA available to tissues, including tumor
tissue. Because previous trials of FO supplementation
have reported noncompliance18 or cross-contamination
between control and intervention arms,19 concentrations
of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipids were analyzed
in both the SOC and FO groups as a secondary measure
of compliance. Blood was drawn from patients by a registered nurse before chemotherapy initiation (baseline), 1
day before each 3 week cycle of chemotherapy, and on the
last day of chemotherapy treatment.
Anthropometric Measurements
Height and weight were measured using a stadiometer
and a medical balance-beam scale at baseline. Body
mass index (BMI in kg/m2) was calculated from height
and weight. Self-reported weight loss in the 6 months

preceding enrollment in the study was recorded using the
patient-generated subjective global assessment20 or from
patient history. Height and weight recorded by hospital staff
on the same date were used for verification when available.
Lower than normal muscle mass (sarcopenia) has
emerged as an important predictor of chemotherapy toxicity.21,22 Computed tomography (CT) image analysis
can precisely quantify skeletal muscle.23 To distinguish
between the effect of FO and the effect of sarcopenia on
toxicity, CT images taken for diagnostic purposes at the
time of oncologic referral were analyzed to determine the
prevalence of sarcopenia in the FO and SOC groups.
Cross-sectional muscle areas (cm2) were determined for 2
consecutive images taken at the third lumbar vertebrae
(L3) using Slice-O-matic software V4.3 (Tomovision,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as described previously.23
Mean muscle area was calculated and subsequently normalized for stature (cm2/m2). Lumbar skeletal muscle area
is linearly related to whole-body skeletal muscle.24 To
express data in conventional units, a regression equation
was used to estimate whole-body skeletal muscle,24 and a
density of 1.04 g/cm3 was used to convert muscle volume
to mass.25 Sex-specific cutpoints (males <55.4 cm2/m2
and females <38.9 cm2/m2) that were previously defined
and used in advanced cancer populations23,26 were used to
classify patients as sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic.
Tumor Response, Survival, and Toxicity
Assessments
Response to chemotherapy was evaluated by a radiologist
and an oncologist on the basis of clinical examination and
imaging, which consisted of computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, or x-ray after 2 cycles of
chemotherapy. If progressive disease was noted, then
chemotherapy was discontinued. Otherwise, patients
received an additional 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed
by imaging. As 4 cycles is standard practice specifically
agreed upon as Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Alberta
Provincial Lung Tumor Group, response rates was
defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial
response (PR) after 4 cycles of chemotherapy divided by
the number of patients. Clinical benefit was defined as the
sum of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles of
chemotherapy divided by the number of patients.
Toxicity was graded using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Patient
toxicities were graded by a nurse before each cycle of
chemotherapy. Dose was reduced or suspended if patients
developed grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia, or

3776

thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 or greater nonhematological toxicities, excluding alopecia or inadequately treated
nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. After completion of
the trial, patients were followed for post-trial treatment
and determination of time to death. Median follow-up
was 18.5 months for all living patients. There were only 8
deaths in the FO group leaving 46.7% of patients censored, which coupled with our small sample size was too
few to conduct a formal survival analysis. Instead, survival
was expressed as percentage of patients surviving 1 year
after enrollment in the trial (1-year survival).
Plasma Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis
Blood was collected in heparin tubes and centrifuged to
isolate plasma, which was immediately frozen at 80 C
until analysis. Plasma fatty acids were extracted using a
2:1 chloroform:methanol solution, and phospholipids
were isolated on G-plates.27 The phospholipid band was
scraped, and C17:0 standard (1 mg/L) was added followed
by direct methylation. Plasma phospholipid fatty acid
composition was determined using automated gas liquid
chromatography (Varian 3600CX Gas Chromatograph;
Varian, Mississauga, Canada) as previously described.28
Plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA were expressed as a
proportion (%) of total phospholipid fatty acids.29
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was chemotherapy response rates.
Clinical benefit, chemotherapy toxicity, and survival
were secondary endpoints. Data are presented as mean
 standard deviation. Significance was determined at P <
.05. Student t-test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test
were used to determine differences between SOC and FO
groups where appropriate. All tests were two-sided. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of response
to treatment (PR or CR vs SD and PD) and grade 3 or 4
toxicities. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
(version 18.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Initial screening was performed on 204 patients. Major
reasons for exclusion included ineligible for chemotherapy
and participation in a clinical trial (nonstandard chemotherapy). Thirty-one patients in the SOC group and 15
patients in the FO group completed the study. Our
sample size is a reflection of the inherent difficulties of
conducting studies in palliative care. No patients

withdrew their consent, but 13 patients in the SOC group
and 7 patients in the FO group were accrued and subsequently deemed ineligible due to rapid disease progression and inability to tolerate planned chemotherapy.
Baseline characteristics and anthropometric measures of the FO and SOC group were well matched
(Table 1). In addition, characteristics of these groups
are comparable to those observed in the NSCLC population at our cancer center.16,30 Although weight loss
in the 6 months preceding oncology referral was common, no patients in either group were underweight
(BMI < 18.5 kg/m2). More than 50% of patients in
each group were overweight or obese. Sarcopenia was
highly prevalent in both the FO and SOC groups
(46.7% vs 51.6%; P ¼ .75). Reported use of overthe-counter supplements did not differ between groups
(P ¼ .49). The proportion of patients receiving carboplatin with vinorelbine versus carboplatin with gemcitabine did not differ between groups (P ¼ .75).

Compliance to the FO supplement was more than
95%. Mean intake was 2.1  0.25 g EPA and 0.29 
0.04 g DHA per day. No difference in plasma EPA or
DHA concentration was observed between patients taking
liquid fish oil or fish oil capsules (P ¼ .42 and P ¼ .62,
respectively). In the FO group, plasma phospholipids
EPA and DHA increased significantly after supplementation (Table 2). Plasma phospholipids EPA and DHA after
supplementation was not available from 3 patients in the
SOC group whose chemotherapy was discontinued
because of toxicity, and they were lost to follow-up. There
was no change in plasma phospholipids EPA or DHA
from baseline to end of trial in the SOC group (Table 2).
After supplementation, plasma EPA and DHA in the FO
group were significantly higher than the SOC group
(P<.0001 and P ¼ .04, respectively).
Chemotherapy Response
The response rates and clinical benefit were approximately
2-fold greater in the FO group compared with the SOC
group (Table 3). The proportion of patients in the FO
and SOC group who had a CR, SD, PR, or PD is shown
in Table 3. Logistic regression demonstrated that plasma
phospholipid EPA concentration after supplementation
was a significant predictor of response to chemotherapy
independent of age, sex, BMI, presence of sarcopenia, performance score, and weight loss history (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5; P ¼ .03). There were no
other significant predictors of response to treatment.
Compared with the FO group, a greater percentage
of patients in the SOC group had progressive disease after
2 cycles of chemotherapy. Consequently, more patients in
the FO group completed all planned chemotherapy
(86.7% vs 54.8%, P ¼ .03). On average, patients in
the FO group completed an additional 3 weeks of

chemotherapy (1 cycle) compared with patients in the
SOC group (Table 3).
Despite the wide variation in overall survival (1-30
months), 1-year survival in the FO group appeared to be
greater than in the SOC group (Table 3). The median
number of post-trial lines of therapy was 1 in both
cohorts. The most common post-trial therapy was erlotinib (55% of SOC and 53% of FO group). Thirty-five
percent of patients in the SOC group and 27% patients in
the FO did not receive any further treatment (P ¼ .40).
Chemotherapy Toxicity
FO supplementation was well-tolerated with no reported
adverse events. The most commonly reported chemotherapy-related grade 1 and 2 toxicities were neutropenia followed by nausea, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. The
overall incidence of any grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 22.6% in
the SOC group versus 13.3% in the FO group (P ¼ .46).
Grades 3 and 4 toxicities included nausea, vomiting,
hand-foot syndrome, neutropenia, constipation, and gastritis. One patient in each group discontinued treatment
because of fatigue and increased symptom burden. Hematological toxicity resulted in treatment discontinuation in
2 patients in the SOC group. In the SOC group, a further
2 patients discontinued chemotherapy because of gastritis
and hand-foot syndrome. The total incidence of grade 3
or 4 toxicity resulting in discontinuation of planned
chemotherapy did not differ between groups (16.1% vs
6.7%, P ¼ .52). Logistic regression did not reveal any significant predictors of grade 3 or 4 toxicity.

DISCUSSION
The goal of palliative chemotherapy is to improve
symptoms and survival. However, more than 65%
of advanced NSCLC cases do not respond to first-line

3778

chemotherapy,2-4 and 1-year survival rates are low. This is
the first study to show that the addition of approximately
2.5 g of EPA plus DHA per day significantly increases the
response rates to first-line chemotherapy compared with
SOC without affecting the toxicity profile. In addition,
supplementation with FO has the potential to increase
survival as a greater proportion of patients in the FO
group were surviving at time of censorship.
The response rates observed in this study represents
an approximately 2-fold-increase over the SOC group, and
only 3 patients in the FO group did not experience clinical
benefit from chemotherapy. Comparatively, one-third of
patients in the SOC group responded to treatment, which
falls within the range of response rates reported in large
randomized trials of first-line combination chemotherapy
regimens.2-4 Our finding is concordant with a previous
study in an animal model of lung cancer, which showed
that the combination of cisplatin chemotherapy and dietary FO resulted in slower tumor growth and a lower metastatic load.10 In humans, a positive correlation between
chemotherapy efficacy and breast tissue n-3 fatty acid concentration in patients with breast cancer has been
reported.31 The same researchers followed up this study
with a trial examining the ability of supplementation with
DHA to improve response rates in patients with advanced
breast cancer15 and found that despite the poor prognosis
of the patient population, the response rates was comparable to previous trials for standard first-line chemotherapy.
Only one-third of patients with nonoperable stage
III and IV NSCLC survive 1 year after first-line platinumbased treatment.4,32,33 Comparably, approximately twothirds of patients in the FO group were surviving 1 year
post-trial. Although the difference in 1-year survival only
tended toward significance between the FO and SOC
groups, this may be a reflection of our small sample size.

Cancer

Fish Oil and Chemotherapy Response/Murphy et al

The observed increase in survival may be due to the
increased response rates and decreased tumor burden.
Bougnoux et al15 reported a similar increase in survival in
advanced breast cancer patients supplemented with DHA.
In addition, higher plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA
concentrations, as observed in the FO group, have been
shown to be predictive of increased survival in patients
with advanced cancer.34 A further study by Gogos et al35
demonstrated increased survival in patients with generalized malignancy when provided with fish oil versus
placebo. Although we were unable to calculate overall survival because of the large number of censored patients, we
continue to follow the study patients to determine the
effect of FO on overall survival.
Toxicities from carboplatin are cumulative, with few
patients receiving more than 4 cycles. Although patients
in the FO group received more cycles of chemotherapy
than the SOC group, the prevalence of grade 3 and 4
hematological and nonhematological toxicities did not
differ. These results are consistent with animal studies
demonstrating a protective effect on host tissue despite
increased tumor response.36-38 In addition, a protective
effect of high plasma DHA concentrations on hematological toxicities was observed in patients with advanced
breast cancer receiving anthracycline therapy.15 Taken together, these studies show that supplementation with fish
oil does not result in higher chemotherapy sensitivity in
nontarget tissue.
Platinum-based chemotherapy for NSCLC is the
standard worldwide, and a 30% increase over the typically
observed response rates that we report in this study could
have a large impact. In Canada alone, an estimated
24,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer each
year,1 among which 75%-80% are deemed incurable, and
two-thirds will receive palliative chemotherapy. Fish oil
supplementation may represent a safe and nontoxic
approach to improve current standard of care in patients
with lung cancer. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our
results require verification in larger randomized controlled trials, as our study was designed as a pilot study
with a limited sample size. However, the observed difference in response rates between the FO and SOC groups
was striking, even with a small number of patients.
Although this study was open-label, our results are
most likely due to an effect of FO and not due to group
selection bias because the baseline characteristics of the
SOC and FO group were well-matched and representative
of our local NSCLC population. As well, the response
rates and 1-year survival in the SOC group were compara-

ble to those typically observed in chemotherapy trials.
Our study was not designed to investigate underlying
mechanisms, and we are aware that our results do not
ensure causality. However, the interaction between FO
and carboplatin-based chemotherapy holds promise for
improving the treatment of lung cancer patients.

CONCLUSION
The addition of fish oil to standard first-line platinum
based chemotherapy may increase response rates and clinical benefit in patients with advanced NSCLC without
affecting treatment toxicity. Additional randomized trials
are warranted to confirm these findings.
