ABSTRACT
Myxoid sarcoma (MLS) is one of the most common types of malignant soft tissue
tumors. MLS is characterized by the FUS-DDIT3 or EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion oncogenes
that encode abnormal transcription factors. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
encoding RET was previously identified as a putative downstream target gene to
FUS-DDIT3 and here we show that cultured MLS cells expressed phosphorylated
RET together with its ligand Persephin. Treatment with RET specific kinase inhibitor
Vandetanib failed to reduce RET phosphorylation and inhibit cell growth, suggesting
that other RTKs may phosphorylate RET. A screening pointed out EGFR and ERBB3
as the strongest expressed phosphorylated RTKs in MLS cells. We show that ERBB3
formed nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes with RET and both RTKs were previously
reported to form complexes with EGFR. The formation of RTK hetero complexes could
explain the observed Vandetanib resistence in MLS. EGFR and ERBB3 are clients of
HSP90 that help complex formation and RTK activation. Treatment of cultured MLS
cells with HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, caused loss of RET and ERBB3 phosphorylation
and lead to rapid cell death. Treatment of MLS xenograft carrying Nude mice resulted
in massive necrosis, rupture of capillaries and hemorrhages in tumor tissues. We
conclude that complex formation between RET and other RTKs may cause RTK
inhibitor resistance. HSP90 inhibitors can overcome this resistance and are thus
promising drugs for treatment of MLS/RCLS.

INTRODUCTION

isoform (Figure 1B), and immunohistochemical (IHC)
analysis of tumor tissues detected RET protein in both
nuclei and cytoplasm of most tumor cells (Figure 1C).

Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) accounts for more
than a third of all liposarcoma cases [1]. This entity
is characterized by t(12;16) or more rarely t(12;22)
chromosome translocations that result in fusions of the
transcription factor gene DDIT3 (also known as CHOP
or GADD153) to FUS (also designated TLS) or to EWSR1
[2–4]. The chimerical FUS-DDIT3 and EWSR1-DDIT3
encoded proteins are believed to function as abnormal
transcription factors and FUS-DDIT3 was reported to
cause MLS like tumors in experimental mouse models
[3, 5]. Most MLS tumors carry normal and functional
TP53 genes and are genetically stable [6, 7].
A subtraction screen for target genes downstream
of FUS-DDIT3 identified the proto oncogene RET among
genes that are expressed in FUS-DDIT3 carrying MLS,
but not in normal adipose tissue or in benign lipoma [8].
RET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) [9–11] that
may bind four alternative RET ligands. Ligand binding
promotes RET complex formation, auto-phosphorylation
[12] and activation of downstream signaling pathways
[13–16]. RET can also form active heterodimers with the
epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) [17] and recently
the receptor tyrosine kinase MET was also reported to
form heterodimers with RET in MLS tissues [18]. Such
hetero-complex formation and activation of RET may
operate in MLS cells as EGFR is strongly expressed in the
tumor cells [19]. The observed co-expression of RET and
EGFR in MLS prompted further investigation of RTKs as
possible drug targets and their role in tumor development.
In the present study, we analyzed the expression of
RET and its ligands in 8 MLS cases and 4 MLS derived
cell lines and investigated its potential interaction with
other RTK species. RTK inhibitors were tested for growth/
survival effects in MLS cell lines. The HSP90 chaperone
proteins enlist RET and several other RTKs as client
proteins [20, 21]. HSP90 inhibitors were thus tested for
effects in MLS cell lines and in an MLS xenograft model.

The RET protein is phosphorylated in MLS cells
Ligands or activating mutations cause autophos­
phorylation of RET Y905 [22]. At least a fraction of the
RET molecules reacted with a phospho-Y905 specific
antibody in MLS (Figure 1B). Sequencing of four MLS
cell lines showed that the Y905 phosphorylation was not
caused by activating mutations in RET [6]. Other full
exome sequencing efforts on large cohorts of MLS also
report normal RET gene sequences [7].

MLS tumors express the RET ligand Persephin
but not co-receptors GFRα1–4
Activation of RET could be caused by RET ligands
in MLS. Our analysis of MLS cell lines showed that
they contained mRNAs for glia derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN) and persephin (PSPN)
but RNA extracted from tumor tissues contained only
the PSPN transcript (Figure  1A). Sequence analysis
of PSPN cDNA from MLS cell lines showed a normal
PSPN sequence (data not shown) and Western blot
analysis of protein extracts from MLS cells showed
two bands at the sizes reported for the unprocessed
PSPN precursor (17 kDa) and the mature PSPN
(12 kDa) (Figure 1B). Both bands were detected with
antibodies against N-terminal and C-terminal parts of
PSPN. IHC analysis with PSPN specific antibodies in
sections from eight MLS tumors showed a cytoplasmic
staining of the tumor cells in all cases (Figure 1C).
RT-PCR analysis of RET co-receptors GFRα1–4 in
four MLS tumors and three MLS-cell lines detected no
transcripts (data not shown).

RET RTK inhibitor Vandetanib fails to block
RET Y905 phosphorylation and cell growth/
survival of MLS derived cells lines

RESULTS

The RTK inhibitor Vandetanib is reported to inhibit
RET kinase activity with 50% inhibition at 100 nM
[23]. However, treatment of MLS cells with up to 2 µM
Vandetanib failed to reduce RET Y905 phosphory­
lation and cell proliferation/survival (Supplementary
Figure 1A and 1B). The observed phosphorylation of RET
Y905 may therefore depend on other, Vandetanib-resistant
kinases.

RET mRNA and protein is expressed in MLS cell
lines and tumor tissues
A meta-analysis of public expression array datasets
from 434 human tumor samples, pointed out expression
of RET as typically for MLS compared to other soft tissue
tumors (Supplementary Data Table 1).
RT-PCR analysis with three primer pairs that
amplified sequences encoding extracellular, transmem­
brane and tyrosine kinase encoding parts showed that full
length RET transcripts were expressed in all MLS tumors
investigated (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis of RET in
protein extracts from three MLS cell lines showed reactive
bands at 170 kDa, the reported size for the longest RET

phosphorylated RTKs in MLS cell lines (Figure 2A).
Western blot analysis confirmed that EGFR (130 kDa) and
ERBB3 (190 kDa) proteins were expressed in three MLS
cell lines and that at least a fraction of these proteins were
phosphorylated at their activation specific positions Y1068
and Y1289, respectively (Figure 2B). IHC studies of MLS
tissues showed surface/cytoplasmic expression of EGFR
whereas ERBB3 showed nuclear/cytoplasmic localization
in MLS tissues and cell lines (Figure 2C).

(PLA) showed that ERBB3 and RET localized close
enough for PLA detection (Figure 2D), indicating that
these molecules indeed form hetero-complex in MLS
cells. The hetero-complex formation was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation one word of RET with EGFP-antibodies
in ERBB3-EGFP transfected MLS cells (Figure 2F).
Our IHC and PLA results showed a mixed
cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of RET and ERBB3
(Figures 1C, 2C and Supplementary Film Clips).

(Figures 1C and 2C), raised our suspicion that RET and
ERBB3 also could form complexes. Proximity ligation assays

failed to block growth/survival at concentrations within
their range of specificity (Supplementary Figure 1D).

(Supplementary Data Table 1). Expression of RET in MLS
has independently been reported by others and higher
expression level has been associated with poor survival
[18, 26, 27]. Here, we show that PSPN, one GDNF-family
member ligand of RET, is expressed in MLS and that the
RET protein is phosphorylated at tyrosine 905 (Y905) as
a sign of receptor activation [28–33]. PSPN binds to RET
in complex with glycosyl-phosphatidyl­inositiol (GPI)anchored co-receptors GFRα1–4 [13–15, 34, 35]. We did
not detect any GFRα1–4 transcripts in the tumors or cell
lines. However, GFRα1–4 independent ligand binding
and RET signaling has been described [36], indicating
a possible role for autocrine RET activation by PSPN in
MLS. Expression of Artemin, another RET ligand and
the RET coreceptor GFRα3 has been reported in MLS by
Negri et al. [18], but we have, for unknown reasons, not
detected transcripts/proteins from these genes in our cohort
of MLS. Taken together, the expression of RET in MLS
and the reported function of RET in cell survival/growth
mechanisms, suggests that this RTK may be important
in MLS pathogenesis. These results also provided a
rationale for trying to block RET Y905 phosphorylation
with the RET specific TK inhibitor Vandetanib. This drug
failed, however, to block RET Y905 phosphorylation or
cell growth indicating that RET phosphorylation was
maintained by a Vandetanib resistant kinase, possibly
another RTK species that could form complex with RET.
Our screen for phosphorylated RTKs pointed out
EGFR and ERBB3 as the most abundantly expressed
in MLS. Using PLA and co-IP techniques, we showed,
for the first time, that RET and ERBB3 form heterocomplexes. ERBB3 forms hetero-complexes with several
other members of the EGFR RTK family but cannot form
homodimers [24]. Adding to the complicated scenario of
interacting RTKs, a previous report also suggest that RET
may interact with and be phosphorylated by the MET RTK
in MLS [18]. MLS cells thus contain at least four distinct
RTK species (RET, EGFR, MET and ERBB3) that can
form various complexes around RET. This could result in
deregulated RTK activation and increased growth/survival
of the tumor cells.
The finding that RET may form dimers with EGFR
[17], provided a rationale for trying to block RET Y905
phosphorylation and growth/survival with the EGFR
specific RTK inhibitor Gefitinib or combinations of
Gefitinib and Vandetanib. No decrease in cell growth
was observed at concentrations within the range of RTK
specificity, indicating that the survival/growth supporting
activity was maintained by a Gefitinib and Vandetanib
resistant mechanism. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
SRC has been reported to phosphorylate RET at Y905
and promote RET protein activity [37]. This SRC activity
could possibly explain the Vandetanib resistance of RET
in MLS is compatible with the reported growth inhibiting
and cytotoxic effects of a specific SRC inhibitor in MLS
cells [38].

The HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG causes loss
of phosphorylated RET, EGFR and ERBB3
proteins in MLS cell lines
The failure to inhibit RET Y905 phosphorylation
with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors could possibly
be explained by formation of multi-member protein
complexes between RET, EGFR, ERBB3 and perhaps
yet other tyrosine kinases. This hypothesis led us to
investigate other means of modifying the activity of the
RTKs. RET, EGFR and ERBB3 are listed among clients
of HSP90 chaperone proteins [20, 21]. Cell proliferation
and survival assays showed an LD50 between 10 and
30 nM for the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG in the tested
MLS cell lines (Figure 3A). The RET Y905, and ERBB3
Y1289 phosphorylation levels were reduced 24 hours after
addition of 17-DMAG while the total RET and ERBB3
protein levels were unaffected (Figure 3B).

The HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG causes massive
necrosis in xenografted MLS tumors
An MLS tumor was serially transplanted in BALB/C
NUDE mice and grew with the typical histological
features of MLS (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure 2A). Xenografts from two mice, each carrying
two tumors, were treated for three days, one injection/
day with 17-DMAG. Three of four tumors showed
hemorrhages with scattered extravasated erythrocytes
and extensive coagulation type necrosis of tumor cells as
well as of small vessels. The fourth and smallest tumor
showed smaller affected areas and no hemorrhages. Four
tumors analyzed after two weeks of treatment showed
similar morphological changes. The extent of necrosis
remained with a peripheral rim of viable tumor cells and
without evidence of adipogenic maturation or stromal
hyalinization (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 2B).
In a separate experiment, 4 animals, each carrying
two tumors were given three injections of 17-DMAG with
48 hours intervals. This was repeated for two weeks with
a 72 hours interval after the third injection. This treatment
caused no dramatic changes in tumor size during, or
immediately after the treatment period, but most tumors
decreased slowly in size or halted their growth during an
83 day follow up period (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
Our previous search for possible downstream
target genes of FUS-DDIT3 identified RET as a candidate
[8] and meta-analysis of microarray data in this study
confirmed expression of RET as a characteristic of MLS

Our IHC analysis showed that RET and ERBB3
was expressed as cytoplasmic/nuclear proteins and this
was confirmed by PLA analysis (Figure  2D, 2E and
Supplementary Film Clips 1–3) and western blot analysis
of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions (Figure 3B) .

Nuclear, smaller variants of ERBB3 have been reported
to bind the promoter and activate transcription of the
cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) [39]. We could not detect
shorter ERBB3 variants in MLS but found the full-length
protein in nuclear MLS extracts (Figure 3A). A role for

nuclear ERBB3 in CCND1 regulation is compatible with
the reported strong expression of CCND1 in MLS [19].
Nuclear expression and specific nuclear down-stream
effects have been reported for many different RTK species
including EGFR, ERBB3 and RET [40–43]. Nuclear RET
expression was reported to cause phosphorylation of the
apoptosis promoting transcription factor ATF4 and thus
inhibit apoptosis and promote survival [43]. The nuclear

expression of ERBB3 together with RET in MLS may thus
be central for MLS pathogenesis.
We have previously reported a cytoplasmic/nuclear
expression of the FLT1 receptor tyrosine kinase and its
ligand PLGF in MLS [44]. Taken together, at least three
RTK species (RET, ERBB3, FLT1)with two of their
ligands (PSPN, PGF) show a nuclear localization in
these cells. This unusual expression pattern stands out as

typical for MLS compared to normal mesenchymal cells.
Cross activation between these and perhaps additional
tyrosine kinases may thus be an essential function for selfsustaining growth and survival of MLS cells and could
also cause the observed resistance to RTK inhibitors [45].
RTK activation and complex formation has been
reported to depend on HSP90 activity [45, 46]. Our data
shows that inhibition of HSP90 functions lead to loss of
RET and ERBB3 phosphorylation. It also caused growth
cessation and death of MLS cells in vitro and extensive
necrosis of xenografted MLS tumors. The cytostatic in
vitro effects of HSP90 inhibition in MLS cell lines has
recently been reported for an unrelated HSP90 inhibitor
[47], confirming the MLS sensitivity to this class of drugs.
Several mechanisms for HSP90 inhibitor induced
cell death have been described including inhibition/
degradation of RTKs [45, 46, 48–51]. HSP90 has a large
number of client proteins and inhibition can be expected
to affect many cellular functions leading to cell death.
However, normal cells, including the human fibroblasts
used as in vitro controls here, were highly resistant to
HSP90 inhibitors. An outstanding difference between
normal fibroblasts and MLS cells, is the co-expression
and nuclear expression of RET and ERBB3. This
difference may play an important role in the vulnerability
of MLS cells exposed by HSP90 inhibition. The fact
that 17-DMAG caused decreased ERBB3 and RET
phosphorylation with maintained total levels of these
proteins prior to cell death supports this conclusion.
Our in vitro results lead us to try HSP90 inhibitor
treatment in an MLS xenograft model. This tumor has
been serially transplanted from the patient and was not

passaged in culture. It closely recapitulates the typical
histology and slow growth pattern of MLS tumors.
HSP90 inhibitor treatment caused massive cell death and
bleeding/rupture of tumor capillaries. Macroscopically,
the tumor tissues showed a slow decline or in some cases
stable size. Histological examination revealed narrow
marginal regions of surviving tumor cells several months
after finished treatment. These surviving tumor cells may
be senescent since MLS tumors contain major populations
of resting and senescent cells [52]. Senescent cells are still
capable of maintaining the extensive extracellular matrix
[53], and could therefore prevent fast shrinkage of 17DMAG treated tumor tissues. The small and slow size
reduction of MLS tumors stands in contrast to the dramatic
histological findings and has to be taken into consideration
when clinical trials with MLS patients are to be evaluated.
We conclude that MLS cells express a mix of
interacting RTKs and their ligands that could cross interact
and cause their resistance to RTK inhibitors. Inhibition
of HSP90 activity could overcome this resistance as
shown by reduced RTK phosphorylation/proliferation
and massive death of the tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
HSP90 inhibitors are therefore attractive drug candidates
for treatment of MLS.

Cells were seeded to 96-well microtiter plates. Drugs
were added after 24 hours at different concentrations.
Each test was set up in three or more replicates. The
medium was removed and plates were washed 72 hours
after treatment and stored in –80°C until analysis. The
cells were lysed and DNA was stained using a Cell

RET specific goat antibody (C-19) (1:200), both from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Assays with unmatched first
antibodies and DuoLink probes and with single DuoLink
probes were used as negative controls and gave no
background signals.
Microphotographs were captured on a Zeiss LSM
700 confocal microscope and deconvolution, image
analysis, quantification of PLA spots and animation
clips were made with the Volocity soft-ware package,
(PerkinElmer Inc). The deconvolution was performed
using iterative restoration with a calculated point spread
function.

15 minutes. Cytoplasmic (supernatant) and nuclear (pellet)
fractions were collected and diluted 1: 4 with 4 × NuPAGE
LDS sample buffer (Life technologies) for Western blot
analysis. Immunoprecipitation of GFP tagged ERBB3 was
made 24 hours after transfection. Cells were harvested and
suspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tis pH 7.5, 150 mM
KCl, 1,5 mM MgCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0,5% NP 40. After
30 minutes on ice followed by a 10 minutes centrifugation
at 16000 × G, the supernatant was diluted to 0,2% NP40.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with GFP-TRAP
beads (Chromotek) according to the manufacturers
protocol.

Western blots analysis

Animals and drug treatment

Whole cell extracts were prepared as described
[58] and separated on a 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel (Life
Technologies as previously described [59]. The proteins
were blotted on Immobilon™-P PVDF membranes
(Millipore Corporation) or Invitrolon PVDF membranes
(Life Technologies) and detected using the following
antibodies: RET (C-19), goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); phospho-RET Tyr-905, rabbit polyclonal
(Cell Signaling Technology); Persephin (N18 and C17),
goat antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); EGFR (E30),
mouse monoclonal (DAKO); phospho-EGFR Tyr-1068
(1H12), mouse monoclonal (Cell Signaling Technology);
ERBB3 (G-4), mouse monoclonal (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); phospho-ERBB3 Tyr-1289 (21D3), rabbit
monoclonal (Cell Signaling Technology); GFP (JL-8)
mouse monoclonal (Clontech); GAPDH (mAbcam
9484), mouse monoclonal (Abcam); Lamin A (133A2),
mouse monoclonal (Abcam). RP-conjugated secondary
antibodies were used: Stabilized Goat Anti-Mouse IgG
(H  + L), Peroxidase Conjugated (Thermo Scientific
Pierce); Stabilized Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L),
Peroxidase Conjugated (Thermo Scientific Pierce); bovine
anti-goat IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
All antibodies were evaluated by tests on positive
and negative control western blot samples and normal
human tissue sections with published and established
expression patterns of EGFR, ERBB3 and RET in specific
cell types as described [19]. Extracts from human cultured
fibroblasts were used as control for RET, Persephin and
ERBB3 proteins. Breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was used
as positive control of ERBB3.
Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
was made from trypsin detached cell suspensions that
were washed twice in PBS and suspended in 100 μl of
ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM TRIS PH 6. 8, 0, 5% TritonX. The cells
were disrupted by repeated pipetting for 5 minutes on ice.
Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for

Five to six weeks old BALB/C NUDE mice
(Janvier Labs) were transplanted with approximately
2 × 2 mm large tumor pieces. Mice with tumor sizes
from 8 × 8 mm were used for drug treatment tests. Tumor
sizes were measured in mm with a caliper from 14 days
after transplantation and volume calculated according
to Feldman et al. [60]. 17-DMAG (Selleckchem) was
dissolved in 150  mM NaCl to a final concentration of
1 mg/ml and stored frozen. The drug was administered
by peritoneal injections (25 mg/Kg body weight). Drug
treatment was started 114 days after transplantation with
three injections at 48 hours intervals repeated for two
weeks with a 72 hours break after injection 3. Tumor sizes
were followed up for 83 days after first injection. The
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and tumors
were immediately collected and transferred to ice-cold 4%
formaldehyde in PBS.
