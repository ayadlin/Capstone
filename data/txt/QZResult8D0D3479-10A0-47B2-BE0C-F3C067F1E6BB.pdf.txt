SUMMARY

Oncogenic mutations regulate signaling within both
tumor cells and adjacent stromal cells. Here, we
show that oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D) also regulates
tumor cell signaling via stromal cells. By combining
cell-specific proteome labeling with multivariate
phosphoproteomics, we analyzed heterocellular
KRASG12D signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. Tumor cell KRASG12D engages heterotypic fibroblasts, which subsequently instigate
reciprocal signaling in the tumor cells. Reciprocal
signaling employs additional kinases and doubles
the number of regulated signaling nodes from cellautonomous KRASG12D. Consequently, reciprocal
KRASG12D produces a tumor cell phosphoproteome
and total proteome that is distinct from cell-autonomous KRASG12D alone. Reciprocal signaling regulates tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis and
increases mitochondrial capacity via an IGF1R/AXLAKT axis. These results demonstrate that oncogene
signaling should be viewed as a heterocellular process and that our existing cell-autonomous perspective underrepresents the extent of oncogene signaling
in cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Solid cancers are heterocellular systems containing both tumor
cells and stromal cells. Coercion of stromal cells by tumor cell
oncogenes profoundly impacts cancer biology (Friedl and Alexander, 2011; Quail and Joyce, 2013) and aberrant tumor-stroma
signaling regulates many hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). While individual oncogene-driven regulators
of tumor-stroma signaling have been identified, the propagation
of oncogene-dependent signals throughout a heterocellular
system is poorly understood. Consequently, our perspective of
oncogenic signaling is biased toward how oncogenes regulate
tumor cells in isolation (Kolch et al., 2015).

In a heterocellular cancer, tumor cell oncogenes drive aberrant
signaling both within tumor cells (cell-autonomous signaling)
and adjacent stromal cells (non-cell-autonomous signaling)
(Croce, 2008; Egeblad et al., 2010). As different cell types process signals via distinct pathways (Miller-Jensen et al., 2007),
heterocellular systems (containing different cell types) theoretically provide increased signal processing capacity over homocellular systems (containing a single cell type). By extension,
oncogene-dependent signaling can theoretically engage additional signaling pathways in a heterocellular system when
compared to a homocellular system. However, to what extent
activated stromal cells reciprocally regulate tumor cells beyond
cell-autonomous signaling is not well understood.
We hypothesized that the expanded signaling capacity provided by stromal heterocellularity allows oncogenes to establish
a differential reciprocal signaling state in tumor cells. To test this
hypothesis, we studied oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D) signaling
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). KRAS is one of
the most frequently activated oncogenic drivers in cancer
(Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011) and is mutated in >90% of PDA
tumor cells (Almoguera et al., 1988). PDA is an extremely heterocellular malignancy—composed of mutated tumor cells, stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells (Neesse
et al., 2011). Crucially, the gross stromal pancreatic stellate cell
(PSC) expansion observed in the PDA microenvironment is
non-cell-autonomously controlled by tumor cell KRASG12D in vivo
(Collins et al., 2012; Ying et al., 2012). As a result, understanding
the heterocellular signaling consequences of KRASG12D is
essential to comprehend PDA tumor biology.
Comprehensive analysis of tumor-stroma signaling requires concurrent measurement of cell-specific phosphorylation
events. Recent advances in proteome labeling now permit cellspecific phosphoproteome analysis in heterocellular systems
(Gauthier et al., 2013; Tape et al., 2014a). Furthermore, advances
in proteomic multiplexing enable deep multivariate phosphosignaling analysis (McAlister et al., 2012; Tape et al., 2014b).
Here, we combine cell-specific proteome labeling, multivariate phosphoproteomics, and inducible oncogenic mutations
to describe KRASG12D cell-autonomous, non-cell-autonomous,
and reciprocal signaling across a heterocellular system. This
study reveals KRASG12D uniquely regulates tumor cells via heterotypic stromal cells. By exploiting heterocellularity, reciprocal
signaling enables KRASG12D to engage oncogenic signaling

pathways beyond those regulated in a cell-autonomous manner.
Expansion of KRASG12D signaling via stromal reciprocation suggests oncogenic communication should be viewed as a heterocellular process.
RESULTS
Tumor Cell KRASG12D Non-cell-autonomously Regulates
Stromal Cells
To investigate how KRASG12D supports heterocellular communication, we first analyzed tumor cell-secreted signals (using PDA
tumor cells containing an endogenous doxycycline inducible
KRASG12D) (Collins et al., 2012; Ying et al., 2012). Measuring
144 growth factors, cytokines, and receptors across three
unique PDA isolations, we observed that KRASG12D increased
secretion of GM-CSF, GCSF cytokines, and the growth
morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Figure 1A). As SHH regulates
pancreatic myofibroblast expansion (Collins et al., 2012; Fendrich et al., 2011; Thayer et al., 2003; Tian et al., 2009; Yauch
et al., 2008), and ablation of SHH signaling reduces PDA tumor
stroma in vivo (Lee et al., 2014; Olive et al., 2009; Rhim et al.,
2014), we focused on understanding the trans-cellular signaling
consequences of SHH.
As previously established, KRASG12D simultaneously induces
SHH secretion (Collins et al., 2012; Lauth et al., 2010) (Figure 1B)
and disrupts primary cilium in PDA cells (Figure 1C). Concordantly, PSCs and KRASWT PDA cells transduce canonical SHH
signaling (via SMO-GLI), while KRASG12D cells do not (Figure 1D).
This enables KRASG12D PDA cells to non-cell-autonomously
signal to PSCs via SHH, while remaining insensitive to autocrine
SHH (Figure 1E).
Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed SHH induces
widespread changes across the cytoplasmic, membrane, and
secreted PSC proteome (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1A; Data S1).
SHH upregulates multiple extracellular matrix components (collagens, MMPs, fibrillin-1, LOX)—suggesting KRASG12D controls
PDA desmoplasia via SHH-activated PSCs. Notably, SHH also
upregulates IGF1 and GAS6 across multiple PSC isolations but
not in PDA cells (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1B). Since IGF1 and
GAS6 are growth factors capable of activating the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) IGF1R and AXL, respectively, this suggests
that SHH-activation alters the intercellular signaling potential of
PSCs.
These results demonstrate KRASG12D non-cell-autonomously
communicates with stromal cells via SHH-SMO-GLI and renders
tumor cells insensitive to autocrine SHH. Moreover, KRASG12D
achieves a unique signaling output (e.g., production of ECM,
IGF1, and GAS6) via stromal cells that is distinct from that produced by tumor cell KRASG12D alone.
KRASG12D Regulates Distinct Cell-Autonomous
Signaling
To provide a baseline of cell-autonomous oncogene-regulated
signaling from which to compare stromal-dependent reciprocal
signaling, we first determined the effect of KRASG12D expression
on the PDA phosphoproteome (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A).
Despite being the primary oncogenic driver in PDA, KRASG12D
only regulates 7% of the observed tumor cell phosphoproteome

(+/ 1 log2, p < 0.01) (Figure 2C; Data S1). KRASG12D expression
induces canonical activation of ERK1/2 and increases phosphorylation of MAPK/CDK1/CKII-directed kinase motifs. However, while the PI3K-AKT axis is often presumed directly downstream of KRASG12D in PDA (Eser et al., 2014)—expression of
KRASG12D does not activate AKT in a cell-autonomous manner
(Figures 2D and S2). This observation is consistent across
multiple PDA cell isolations from several independently developed genetic mouse models (Collins et al., 2012; Ying et al.,
2012) (Figure S3). To further investigate the dependency of
MEK and AKT activity in KRASG12D cell-autonomous signaling,
KRASWT and KRASG12D PDA cells were perturbed with MEK
(PD-184352) and/or AKT (MK-2206) inhibitors and analyzed
by quantitative phosphoproteomics. This analysis confirmed
MEK-ERK1/2, not AKT, controls the differential phosphoproteome of KRASG12D (Figure 2E; Data S1).
Collectively, these observations demonstrate cell-autonomous KRASG12D regulates a distinct section of the tumor cell
phosphoproteome. Notably, KRASG12D induces MAPK/CDK/
CK kinase motifs via MEK-ERK and does not regulate AKT.
Activated Stromal Cells Extend Tumor Cell Signaling
beyond Cell-Autonomous KRASG12D
Given that KRASG12D non-cell-autonomously regulates growth
factor production from PSCs (e.g., IGF1 and GAS6), we hypothesized that KRASG12D-activated PSCs initiate a reciprocal
signaling axis back in the tumor cells. However, given that tumor
cells already undergo phosphoproteomic deregulation by
KRASG12D, it was unclear whether additional reciprocal signals
from PSCs can further regulate the tumor cell phosphoproteome.
To investigate this, the phosphoproteome of KRASWT and
KRASG12D PDA cells were directly compared to PDA cells treated
with conditioned media from SHH-activated PSCs (Figure 3A).
Despite the considerable regulation of cell-autonomous
signaling by KRASG12D, PDA cells are further modulated by signals from SHH-activated PSCs (Figure 3B). In fact, PSC-signaling
regulates (+/ 1 log2, p < 0.01) comparable numbers of PDA tumor
cell phosphosites (6.7% phosphoproteome) when compared to
KRASG12D alone (7.2% phosphoproteome) (Figures 3C, S4A,
and S4B; Data S1). This implies stromal cells can substantially
alter tumor cell signaling beyond cell-autonomous KRASG12D.
Notably, while PDA KRASG12D expression does not activate
AKT in a cell-autonomous manner (Figures 2 and S3), tumor cell
AKT substrate phosphosites (e.g., AKTS1 [pT247] and GSK3a
[pS21]) are exclusively regulated by stromal PSCs (Figures
S4C–S4E).
Targeted temporal analysis revealed SHH-activated PSCs
induce rapid phosphorylation of IGF1R (receptor for IGF-1),
AXL/TYRO3 (receptor for GAS6), and downstream IRS-1 and
AKT (pT308/pS473) in KRASG12D PDA cells (Figure 3D). Tumor
cells treated with conditioned media from control or SHH-activated PSCs and perturbed with either MEK and/or AKT inhibitors
further confirmed PSCs drive a differential phosphoproteome
in PDA cells. However, unlike cell-autonomous KRASG12D,
stromal-driven signaling depends on both active MEK and AKT
(Figure 3E; Data S1).
As IGF1 and GAS6 are secreted by activated PSCs, we investigated the dependency of IGF1R and AXL activity on the

KRASG12D Regulates Tumor Cell Signaling via a
Reciprocal Signaling Axis
Our data suggests that oncogenic KRAS in tumor cells establishes a reciprocal signaling axis between stromal cells and tumor cells. Herein, we define an oncogenic reciprocal signaling
axis as an oncogenic cue that signals via an adjacent heterotypic

cell to produce a distinct response in the oncogene-expressing cell. For this heterocellular variation on the ‘‘cue-signalresponse’’ systems biology paradigm (Janes et al., 2004, 2005;
Miller-Jensen et al., 2007) to be valid, we hypothesized that
oncogenic reciprocal signaling requires three essential features:
(1) an oncogenic cue (e.g., KRASG12D), (2) a cue-driven non-cellautonomous signal (e.g., KRASG12D-induced SHH), and (3) a heterotypic cell capable of transducing the signal response back to
the instigating oncogenic cell (e.g., PSC). To test this multi-node

reciprocal signaling hypothesis, we systematically perturbed
each reciprocal feature in a native heterocellular tumor-stroma
context.
To measure multivariate signaling in a heterocellular system,
concurrent cell-specific and variable-specific phosphoproteomic data are required. We have previously shown that stable isotopic proteome labeling (Ong et al., 2002) can resolve between
discrete cell types in direct culture of heterotypic cells (Jorgensen et al., 2009) and recently introduced cell type-specific labeling with amino acid precursors (CTAP) (Gauthier et al., 2013)
LyrM37-KDEL and DDCM.tub-KDEL enzymes for cell-specific isotopic
labeling (Tape et al., 2014a). To this end, we combined CTAP labeling (spatial resolution) with isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT)
phosphoproteomics (variable resolution) (Tape et al., 2014b;
Thompson et al., 2003) to enable heterocellular multivariate
phosphoproteomic analysis of each reciprocal signaling component (Figure 4A). This technique allows simultaneous observation
of cell-autonomous, non-cell-autonomous, and reciprocal oncogenic phosphoproteomes at cell-specific resolution.
Cell-specific phosphoproteomes were interrogated in PDA
cells expressing either KRASWT or KRASG12D, either in homoor heteroculture with isotopically ‘‘heavy’’-labeled PSCs, and
treated with either SHH inhibitor or vehicle. We monitored
3,695 lysine-containing (8,566 total) phosphopeptides across
eight conditions, two heterotypic cell types, and three biological
replicates with cell-specific resolution (Figures 4B and S5;
Data S1). As expected, expression of KRASG12D in tumor cells
alone regulates (+/ 1 log2) 7.2% of the identified cell-autonomous phosphoproteome. In parallel, tumor cell KRASG12D noncell-autonomously regulates 4.7% of the PSC phosphoproteome. Moreover, when KRASG12D is allowed to communicate
with PSCs via SHH, a reciprocal axis is completed and the differentially regulated tumor cell phosphoproteome almost doubles
to 13.8%. Importantly, perturbation by a SHH blocking antibody
decreases the phosphoproteomic regulation on PSCs back
down to 1.2% and PDA phosphoproteome to 8.1% (close to
cell-autonomous at 7.2%).
Heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomics demonstrates
how tumor cell oncogenes exploit the differential signaling
capacity of stromal cells to achieve a unique signaling state in
the inceptive tumor cell. KRASG12D reciprocal signaling engages
additional phospho-nodes to cell-autonomous KRASG12D alone,
allowing KRASG12D to extend the oncogenic signaling capacity in
the inceptive tumor cells. Crucially, these observations are the
product of native tumor-stroma signaling and are independent
of exogenous stimulation.
KRASG12D-Driven Reciprocal Signaling Regulates the
Tumor Cell Phosphoproteome and Total Proteome
Comprehensive phosphoproteomic quantification of reciprocally
engaged PDA cells (Figures 5A–5C and S6A; Data S1) revealed
upregulation of several AKT substrates (e.g., BAD [pS136],
PDCD4 [pS457], CHSP1 [pS53], AKTS1 [T247], and GSK-3a
[pS21]). Interestingly, cell-autonomous targets of KRASG12D
(e.g., RAF1 [pS621] and ERK1/2 [pT183/pY185; pT203/pY205])
were not regulated by reciprocal signaling—further implying
reciprocal KRASG12D supplements cell-autonomous KRASG12D
by engaging additional tumor cell kinases (Figure S6B).
Cell 165, 910–920, May 5, 2016 913

Reciprocal signaling also activates several translational mediators (e.g., RPS6 [pS235/pS236], PDCD4 [pS457], and EIF4B
[pS422]). Concordantly, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of
PDA cells revealed reciprocal signaling upregulates RNA associated with translational control (Figures S6C–S6F), further suggesting a de novo control of PDA protein abundance. To validate
whether the SHH-driven reciprocal signaling axis regulates
de novo tumor cell protein turnover, PSC+DDCM.tub-KDEL and
PDA+LyrM37-KDEL CTAP cells were differentially isotopically
labeled, treated with a SHH inhibitor or vehicle, and cell-specific
proteomes were quantified in heteroculture (Figure 5D). This
experimental format permitted cell-specific quantification of
changes to the KRASG12D tumor cell proteome following inhibition of the PSC targeting signal (SHH). Parallel perturbations
with AKT and IGF1R/AXL inhibitors provided additional insight
into the role of each reciprocal node.
Cell-specific proteomics confirmed KRASG12D reciprocally
regulates the PDA proteome and is dependent on active SHH,
IGF1R/AXL, and AKT signaling (Figure 5E; Data S1). As with
the PDA phosphoproteome, reciprocal signaling regulates
the PDA proteome differently to cell-autonomous KRASG12D.
For example, while cell-autonomous KRASG12D rapidly depletes
distinct mitochondrial components from PDA cells (Data S1) (Viale et al., 2014), reciprocally engaged KRASG12D restores mitochondrial proteins in an SHH-, IGF1R/AXL-, and AKT-dependent
manner. Moreover, PDA proteins involved with DNA replication are also upregulated under reciprocal conditions. These
results demonstrate reciprocal signaling uniquely regulates
both the tumor cell phosphoproteome and global proteome
when compared to cell-autonomous signaling. Reciprocal
signaling states are unique to a heterocellular environment and
are not observed in tumor cells alone.
KRASG12D-Driven Reciprocal Signaling Regulates
Tumor Cell Phenotypes
Reciprocal signaling regulates proteins and phospho-sites
known to control several important biological processes. For
example, while cell-autonomous and reciprocal KRASG12D
signaling both regulate mitochondrial proteins, many of these
are asymmetrically regulated. As a result, we hypothesized
PDA mitochondrial activity would be differentially regulated
by cell-autonomous and reciprocal KRASG12D. Concordantly,
cell-autonomous KRASG12D decreases PDA mitochondria polarization (Dcm) and mitochondrial superoxide production, whereas
reciprocal signaling increases these processes (via SHH, IGF1R/
AXL, and AKT) (Figures 6A and S7). Furthermore, reciprocal

conditions (via SHH, IGF1R/AXL, and AKT activity) (Figure 6C).
Upregulation of AKT substrates (e.g., inhibition of BAD [pS136])
also suggested reciprocal signaling might protect tumor cells
from apoptosis. Concordantly, TUNEL and caspase 3/7 profiling
revealed activated PSCs protect tumor cells from apoptosis and
sensitize tumor cells to reciprocal node inhibitors (IGF1R/AXL
and AKT) (Figures 6D–6E).
Increased mitochondrial performance, proliferative capacity,
and resistance to apoptosis collectively implied reciprocal
signaling supports tumor cell phenotypes beyond cell-autonomous KRASG12D. In accordance, reciprocal signaling increases
semi-solid colony growth relative to cell-autonomous KRASG12D
alone (Figure 6F). Reciprocal colony growth is dependent on SHH
activation of PSCs and IGF1R/AXL-AKT activity in tumor cells.
Collectively, these results demonstrate the unique signals produced by reciprocal KRASG12D control distinct metabolic, proliferative, anti-apoptotic, and anchorage-independent growth phenotypes in tumor cells.

signaling increases spare mitochondrial respiratory capacity in
tumor cells (Figure 6B). These results demonstrate KRASG12D
can differentially regulate mitochondrial performance via heterocellular communication.
Reciprocal signaling also regulates proteins known to control
cell proliferation and survival. In agreement, cell-specific analysis of PDA proliferation in homo and heterocellular cultures revealed increased tumor cell proliferation under heterocellular

Whether oncogenes regulate tumor cell signaling via stromal
cells is a fundamental question in tumor biology. Using heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomics, we demonstrate how
oncogenic KRAS signals through local non-tumor cells to
achieve a differential reciprocal signaling state in the inceptive
tumor cells. In PDA, this reciprocal axis supplements oncogenic
cell-autonomous signaling to control protein abundance, transcription, mitochondrial activity, proliferation, apoptosis, and
colony formation. Reciprocal signaling is the exclusive product
of heterocellularity and cannot be achieved by tumor cells alone.
These observations imply oncogenes expand their capacity
to deregulate cellular signaling via stromal heterocellularity
(Figure 7).
Despite the well-established heterocellularity of cancer, our
understanding of oncogenic signaling within tumor cells has
largely excluded non-tumor cells. We observe that stromal cells
approximately double the number of tumor cell signaling nodes
regulated by oncogenic KRAS, suggesting both cell-autonomous (internal) and reciprocal (external) stimuli should be
considered when defining aberrant oncogenic signaling states.
For example, although KRAS is thought to cell-autonomously
regulate AKT in PDA (Eser et al., 2014), we show that KRASG12D
activates AKT, not cell-autonomously, but reciprocally. As PI3K
signaling is essential for PDA formation in vivo (Baer et al.,
2014; Eser et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014) reciprocal signaling
may control oncogene-dependent tumorigenesis. Our findings
suggest future genetic studies should consider the heterocellular signaling consequences of oncogene/tumor-suppressor
deregulation.
The observation that many oncogene-dependent tumor cell
signaling nodes require reciprocal activation has important implications for identifying pharmacological inhibitors of oncogene
signaling. For example, if PDA tumor cells were screened alone,
one would expect MEK, MAPK, and CDK inhibitors to perturb
KRASG12D signaling. However, when screened in conjunction
with heterotypic stromal cells, our study additionally identified
SHH, AKT, and IGF1R/AXL inhibitors as KRASG12D-dependent

heterocellular phenotypes (e.g., protein expression, proliferation, mitochondrial performance, and anti-apoptosis), but have
little effect on KRASG12D tumor cells alone. An appreciation of
reciprocal nodes increases our molecular understanding of

drug targets downstream of oncogenic drivers and highlights
focal points where reciprocal signals converge (e.g., AKT). These
trans-cellular observations reinforce the importance of understanding cancer as a heterocellular disease.

toward the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (Ying et al.,
2012), whereas KRASG12D-ablated cells depend on mitochondrial
activity (Viale et al., 2014). Here, we show that heterocellular reciprocal signaling can restore the expression of mitochondrial proteins and subsequently re-establish both mitochondrial polarity
and superoxide levels. This suggests KRASG12D regulates nonoxidative flux through cell-autonomous signaling and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation through reciprocal signaling.
These results provide a unique example of context-dependent
metabolic control by oncogenes and reinforce the emerging role
of tumor-stroma communication in regulating cancer metabolism
(Ghesquière et al., 2014).
In PDA, the stroma has dichotomous pro-tumor (Kraman
et al., 2010; Sherman et al., 2014) and anti-tumor (Lee et al.,
2014; Rhim et al., 2014) properties. It is becoming increasingly
evident that non-cell-autonomously activated stromal cells

vary within a tumor and can influence tumors in a non-obvious
manner. For example, while vitamin D receptor normalization
of stromal fibroblasts improves PDA therapeutic response
(Sherman et al., 2014), total stromal ablation increases malignant behavior (Lee et al., 2014; Rhim et al., 2014). Thus, while
stromal purging is unlikely to provide therapeutic benefit in
PDA, ‘‘stromal reprogramming’’ toward an anti-tumor stroma
is now desirable (Brock et al., 2015). Although we describe a
largely pro-tumor reciprocal axis, both pro- and anti-tumor stromal phenotypes likely transduce across reciprocal signaling
networks. Our work suggests future efforts to therapeutically
reprogram the PDA stroma toward anti-tumor phenotypes will
require an understanding of reciprocal signaling. In describing
the first oncogenic reciprocal axis, this study provides a foundation to measure the cell-cell communication required for anti-tumor stromal reprogramming.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
KRASG12D-Induced Soluble Signaling Molecules
KRASWT PDA cells (1 3 106) were plated in a 6-well dish and cultured in
DMEM + 0.5% FBS ± 1 mg/ml doxycycline for 72 hr. Conditioned media was
analyzed for relative changes in KRASG12D-driven cytokines and growth factors using the RayBio Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array G2000 (RayBiotech
AAM-CYT-G2000-8) (144 proteins quantified in duplicate per sample).
SHH-N expression after 24 hr was further validated by sandwich ELISA
(R&D Systems DY461).

Figure 7. Heterocellular Oncogenic Signaling
In a homocellular context, tumor cell oncogenic signaling operates within
distinct cell-autonomous phospho-networks. As heterotypic cell types can
transduce different signals, a heterocellular system provides increased
oncogenic signaling space over a homocellular system. Tumor cells can use
heterocellularity to bypass the cell-autonomous threshold via non-cellautonomous signaling. Activated stromal cells can then return unique reciprocal signals to the initiating oncogenic tumor cell. Reciprocal signaling
subsequently allows oncogenes to adopt a tumor cell oncogenic signaling
space beyond cell-autonomous signaling alone.

We demonstrate heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomics can be used to observe reciprocal signaling in vitro.
Unfortunately, cell-specific isotopic phosphoproteomics is not
currently possible in vivo. To delineate reciprocal signaling
in vivo, experimental systems must support manipulation of multiple cell-specific variables and provide cell-specific signaling
readouts. Simple pharmacological perturbation of reciprocal nodes (e.g., IGF1R, AXL, AKT, etc.) in existing PDA GEMMs will in
principle affect all cell types (e.g., tumor cells, PSCs, immune
cells) and cannot provide axis-specific information in vivo. Future
in vivo studies of reciprocal signaling will require parallel inducible genetic manipulation (e.g., oncogene activation in cancer
cell and/or inhibition of reciprocal node in stromal cell), combined with cell-specific signaling data (e.g., using epithelial tissue mass-cytometry) (Simmons et al., 2015).
We describe KRASG12D reciprocal signaling between PDA tumor cells and PSCs. However, it is likely oncogenic reciprocal
signaling occurs across multiple different cell types in the tumor
microenvironment. For example, in PDA, FAP+ stromal fibroblasts secrete SDF1 that binds tumor cells to suppress T cells
(Feig et al., 2013). Our model predicts oncogene signaling expands across several cell types in the tumor microenvironment—including immune cells. Moreover, as oncogenes noncell-autonomously regulate the stroma in many other tumor
types (Croce, 2008), our model predicts oncogenic reciprocal
signaling to be a broad phenomenon across all heterocellular
cancers. The presented heterocellular multivariate phosphoproteomic workflow now enables future characterization of oncogenic reciprocal signaling in alternative cancer types.
As differentiated cells process signals in unique ways, heterocellularity provides increased signal processing space over homocellularity. We provide evidence that KRASG12D exploits heterocellularity via reciprocal signaling to expand tumor cell
signaling space beyond cell-autonomous pathways. Given the
frequent heterocellularity of solid tumors, we suspect reciprocal

KRASG12D Cell-Autonomous Signaling
For comprehensive phosphoproteomic quantification of KRASG12D-dependent cell-autonomous signaling, 1 3 106 KRASWT PDA cells were plated in a
6-well dish (DMEM + 0.5% FBS) and cultured ± 1 mg/ml doxycycline for
24 hr (biological replicates n = 5). Cells were lysed in 6 M urea, 10 mM NaPPi,
20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, sonicated, centrifuged to clear cell debris, and protein
concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce 23225). One hundred micrograms of each condition were individually digested by FASP (Wisniewski
et al., 2009), amine-TMT-10-plex-labeled (Pierce 90111) on membrane (iFASP)
(McDowell et al., 2013), eluted, pooled, lyophilized, and subjected to automated phosphopeptide enrichment (APE) (Tape et al., 2014b). Phosphopeptides were desalted using OLIGO R3 resin (Life Technologies 1-1339-03) and
lyophilized prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) analysis (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Automated Phosphopeptide Enrichment
For TMT-labeled samples, phosphopeptides were enriched from each fraction
using the automated phosphopeptide enrichment (APE) method described by
Tape et al. (2014b). Phosphopeptide fractions were individually desalted using
OLIGO R3 resin (Life Technologies 1-1339-03) and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid prior to Q-Exactive Plus HCD FT/FT LC-MS/MS (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). For reciprocal phosphoproteomics PSCPDA co-cultures, 15 mg protein was digested with 150 mg Lys-C (Wako 12505061) (24 hr) and 150 mg Trypsin (Worthington) (24 hr) using 2 ml FASP.
Lyophilized tryptic peptides were re-suspended in 60% MeCN and resolved
using a Ultimate 3000 (Dionex) high-performance liquid chromatography fitted
with a 10 mm particle size, 7.8 mm ID, and 30 cm TSKgel Amide-80 hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column (Tosoh 14459) (McNulty and
Annan, 2008) into 24 fractions. Phosphopeptides were enriched from each
fraction by APE. Phosphopeptide fractions (n = 192) were individually desalted
using OLIGO R3 resin (Life Technologies 1-1339-03) and re-suspended in
0.1% formic acid prior to LTQ Velos HCD FT/FT LC-MS/MS (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Multi-axis Phosphoproteomics
For concurrent PDA cell-autonomous and reciprocal phosphoproteomics, 1 3
106 PSCs were plated in a 6-well dish, stimulated with 5 nM SHH-N (C25II)
(R&D Systems 464-SH-025/CF) in DMEM + 0.5% FBS, and conditioned media
was collected after 48 hr. PDA cells (1 3 106) were cultured without doxycycline (KRASWT), with 1 mg/ml doxycycline (KRASG12D), and with 1 mg/ml doxycycline (KRASG12D) + PSC+SHH conditioned media (biological n = 3) (all
in +0.5% dialyzed FBS). One hundred micrograms of each condition was
then processed for TMT and APE analysis as described above.
Cell-Type Labeling with Amino Acid Precursors
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (DDCM.tub-KDEL) (P0A5M4) diaminopimelate
decarboxylase (DDC) and Proteus mirabilis lysine racemase (LyrM37-KDEL)
(M4GGR9) were synthesized by GeneArt. Full details can be found in Tape
et al. (2014a). DDC cells were grown in DMEM (-K/-R) (Caisson DMP49) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS (GIBCO), 0.3 mM L-arginine (Sigma
A8094) and 5 mM meso-2,6-diaminopimelate (DAP) (Sigma 07036). Lyr cells
were grown in DMEM (-K/-R) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS,

0.3 mM L-arginine and either 2.5 mM ‘‘Medium’’ D-lysine-4,4,5,5-d4 HCl (C/D/
N D-7334) (Delta mass: 4.025107, Delta average mass: 4.0246) or 2.5 mM
‘‘Heavy’’ D-lysine-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-d8 2HCl (C/D/N D-6367) (Delta mass:
8.0502136, Delta average mass: 8.04928).
Heterocellular Multivariate Phosphoproteomics
PDA cells were transfected with DDCM.tub-KDEL and grown on 5 mM DAP
(‘‘Light’’). PSCs were transfected with LyrM37-KDEL and grown on 2.5 mM
D-lysine-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-d8 2HCl (‘‘Heavy’’). PDA+DDC cells (3 3 106) were
cultured in a 10 cm dish ± 1 mg/ml doxycycline, ±10 mg/ml SHH neutralizing
monoclonal antibody (mAb) (R&D Systems MAB4641) and ±3 3 106 ‘‘Heavy’’
PSC+Lyr cells (biological triplicates). All cells were grown in DMEM (-K/-R)
supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) dialyzed FBS, 0.3 mM L-arginine, 5 mM DAP,
and 2.5 mM ‘‘Heavy’’ D-lysine. After 5 days, each condition was lysed in 6 M
urea, sonicated, centrifuged to clear cell debris, and protein concentration
was determined by BCA. One hundred micrograms of each variable was
then processed for TMT and APE analysis as described above.
Heterocellular Reciprocal Proteomics
To investigate reciprocal regulation of PDA protein abundance, ‘‘Heavy’’ PDA+
LyrM37-KDEL cells were co-cultured with ‘‘Light’’ PSC+DDCM.tub-KDEL in the presence of 2.5 mM ‘‘Heavy’’ D-lysine-3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-d8 and 5 mM ‘‘Light’’ DAP
(biological n = 3). For each experiment, a control co-culture of ‘‘Medium’’ PDA+
LyrM37-KDEL cells and ‘‘Light’’ PSC+DDCM.tub-KDEL was performed in the presence of either PDA pre-treatment with IGF1R inhibitor (250 nM picropodophyllin [PPP]), AXL inhibitor (500 nM R428), or 20 mg/ml SHH-neutralizing antibody
(R&D Systems MAB4641). All co-cultures were performed in +0.5% dialyzed
FBS for 72 hr. Co-cultures were lysed in 100 mM Na2CO3 (pH 11.0), pooled,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, treated with Benzonase (Novagen 70746),
centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (to resolve membrane-bound proteins from cytosolic
proteins), and denatured in 6 M urea 2 M thiourea. Differential changes in cytoplasmic and membrane protein levels were determined using ‘‘In-gel digestion’’
(see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To investigate the comparative KRASG12D cell-autonomous proteome, KRASWT ‘‘Medium’’ and ‘‘Heavy’’
PDA+LyrM37-KDEL cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes (biological n = 3)
(5 3 106 PDA cells/plate). Doxycycline (1 mg/ml) was then added to the ‘‘Heavy’’
PDA cells (i.e., KRASG12D) and the ‘‘Medium’’ cells were left untreated (i.e.,
KRASWT) (in +0.5% dialyzed FBS). After 72 hr, cells were lysed as above.
