ABSTRACT
Inhibition of FASN has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer,
and numerous inhibitors have been investigated. However, severe pharmacological
limitations have challenged their clinical testing. The synthetic FASN inhibitor
triclosan, which was initially developed as a topical antibacterial agent, is merely
affected by these pharmacological limitations. Yet, little is known about its mechanism
in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Here we compared the cellular and molecular
effects of triclosan in a panel of eight malignant and non-malignant prostate cell lines
to the well-known FASN inhibitors C75 and orlistat, which target different partial
catalytic activities of FASN. Triclosan displayed a superior cytotoxic profile with a
several-fold lower IC50 than C75 or orlistat. Structure-function analysis revealed
that alcohol functionality of the parent phenol is critical for inhibitory action. Rescue
experiments confirmed that end product starvation was a major cause of cytotoxicity.
Importantly, triclosan, C75 and orlistat induced distinct changes to morphology,
cell cycle, lipid content and the expression of key enzymes of lipid metabolism,
demonstrating that inhibition of different partial catalytic activities of FASN activates
different metabolic pathways. These finding combined with its well-documented
pharmacological safety profile make triclosan a promising drug candidate for the
treatment of prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

product, free palmitate [2].
FASN is expressed at relatively low levels in
normal cells (except liver, brain, lung and adipose tissue),
whereas it is highly expressed in a wide variety of cancers,
including cancer of the prostate, breast, brain, lung, ovary,
endometrium, colon, thyroid, bladder, kidney, liver,
pancreas, stomach, oesophagus, eye, mesothelium and
skin (reviewed in [3]). Elevated expression of FASN has
been found in the earliest stages of cancer development
and becomes more pronounced during tumor progression.
In prostate cancer (PCa), elevated levels of FASN have
been linked to poor prognosis, reduced disease-free
survival, aggressiveness of disease, and increased risk
of death (reviewed in [3]). Despite the presence of high
levels of circulating dietary FAs, FASN plays a central role

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key metabolic
enzyme that catalyzes in a stepwise and sequential
manner the de novo synthesis of fatty acids (FA),
predominantly palmitate, from the condensation of seven
molecules of malonyl-CoA and one molecule of acetylCoA. This NADPH-dependent process plays a central
role in energy homeostasis by converting excess carbon
intake into FAs for storage [1]. As a homodimeric,
multifunctional enzyme, FASN employs seven catalytic
activities (β-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyl transferase,
dehydrase, enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, and acyl
carrier protein) during each cycle of FA chain elongation
before its thioesterase activity releases the ultimate

in tumor cell development and survival. Knockdown or
pharmacological inhibition of FASN selectively induces
cell death of cancer cells and a reduction in tumor volume
in xenograft mouse models with only a minimal effect
on normal cells, indicating that FASN is a promising
target for cancer treatment with the potential for a large
therapeutic index (reviewed in [4]).
Several natural and synthetic FASN inhibitors
such as the antifungal agent cerulenin and its synthetic
derivative C75, the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin3-gallate (EGCG) and other flavonoids (luteolin,
quercetin, and kaempferol), the β-lactone orlistat as well
as the bactericide triclosan have been shown to inhibit
cancer cell growth by inducing cell death (reviewed in
[4]). Some of these inhibitors have been shown to work
by directly binding and inhibiting different active sites
of FASN. For example, cerulenin and C75 interact with
the β-ketoacyl synthase domain and irreversibly inhibit
the condensation reaction (reviewed in [4]). In addition,
C75 was found to also inactivate the enoyl reductase
and thioesterase partial activities of FASN [5]. EGCG
acts through competitive binding inhibition of NADPH
and irreversible inactivation of the β-ketoacyl reductase
activity [6], orlistat inhibits FASN through formation of
a covalent adduct with the thioesterase domain [7], and
triclosan (TCS) binds and inactivates the enoyl reductase
domain [8]. Given the multi-domain structure of FASN, it
is not surprising that the cytotoxic effect of various FASN
inhibitors can have different underlying mechanisms, such
as end product starvation through depletion of palmitate,
or toxic accumulation of the FASN substrate malonyl-CoA
or intermediates of FA synthesis.
Although FASN inhibitors showed promising anticancer activities, their evaluation in clinical trials was
challenged due to pharmacological limitations. Cerulenin
was found to be chemically unstable and undesirable for
use in vivo due to its very reactive epoxy group. This led to
the development of the chemically more stable, synthetic
derivative C75 [9]. However, studies in mice revealed
that C75 and cerulenin cause appetite suppression and
profound weight loss through direct activation of carnitine
palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1), which leads to increased
FA β-oxidation [10]. These concerns have been addressed
with the development of C93, a derivative of C75 that
does not activate CPT-1 [11]. EGCG as a clinical FASN
inhibitor is challenged by its low potency, bioavailability,
serum stability and specificity, which is due to its off-target
effects (inhibition of several kinases and topoisomerases)
(reviewed in [12]). A clinical application of orlistat will
require novel formulations, because it is poorly soluble
and has an extremely low oral bioavailability [13]. TCS is
an FDA-approved topical broad-spectrum antibiotic that
inhibits type II enoyl reductase in bacteria [14] and has
been in use for more than 30 years in personal hygiene
products. TCS strongly binds to bacterial type II enoyl
reductases with affinities in the low picomolar range [15].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Although bacterial and human FASN share very little
sequence homology, TCS was found a decade ago to also
inhibit the enoyl reductase partial activity of human FASN
and to block growth of the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and SKBr-3 at concentrations in the low micromolar
range [8]. Since then, TCS-induced cytotoxicity in
cancer cells has been reported for the retinoblastoma
Y79 cell line, the epithelial carcinoma KB cell line [16]
and the choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cell line [17], whereas
similar concentrations of TCS were not cytotoxic to
non-malignant cell lines derived from fibroblasts (3T3)
or Müller glia (MIOM1) [16, 18]. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated in a rat model of mammary carcinogenesis
that TCS-mediated inhibition of FASN significantly
reduced tumor incidence and tumor numbers per animal,
with only minor effects on body weight and no effects on
food intake [19]. Similarly, treatment of male rats for 60
days with a daily dose between 5-20 mg/kg TCS did not
induce significant changes in body weight at any of the
test doses [20]. The lack of any significant weight loss
strongly suggests that TCS does not share the side-effects
of appetite suppression, CPT-1 activation, and increased
FA β-oxidation that impeded the development of cerulenin
and C75 into clinical FASN inhibitors.
The fact that PCa is the most frequently diagnosed
malignancy in men and the second leading cause of male
cancer death in industrialized countries [21] highlights
the need for alternative therapeutic strategies to manage
this devastating disease. Our interest to evaluate the
FASN inhibitor TCS as a potential chemotherapeutic for
the treatment of PCa was supported by previous findings
that TCS showed minimal toxicity in rats, dogs and
baboons when treated daily over several months [22] and
that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of FASN
with C75 induced cell death of PCa cells in vitro and a
reduction in tumor volume in vivo (reviewed in [4]). Here,
we tested TCS for the first time in various PCa cell lines
and compared its cytotoxic potency and phenotypic effects
on cell morphology, cell cycle, cellular lipid levels, and
expression and regulation of key enzymes involved in
energy homeostasis and FA synthesis to the well-known
FASN inhibitors C75 and orlistat.

RESULTS
Triclosan is cytotoxic in prostate cancer cells
In order to evaluate the effect of the FASN inhibitor
triclosan (TCS) on the growth of the PCa cell line LNCaP
and to compare its activity to other FASN inhibitors, we
treated cells with TCS (2.5-20 M), C75 (5-50 µM) or
orlistat (10-80 µM) and measured cell confluence by live
imaging for 96 hours (Fig. 1A). In addition, we included
TOFA (5-40 µM) in this analysis, which is an inhibitor of

acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the rate-limiting enzyme
of de novo FA synthesis which converts acetyl-CoA into
malonyl-CoA [23]. As shown in Figure 1A, all inhibitors
were cytotoxic to LNCaP cells, and cell death was
preceded by loss of cell-cell contacts, cell shrinkage, and
membrane blebbing which are typical signs of apoptosis
(data not shown). Yet, the timing of growth inhibition and
cell death was different between the inhibitors, as indicated
by their distinct growth profiles. While LNCaP cells
treated with 40 µM of C75, orlistat or TOFA continued to
grow between 20-36 h at a similar rate as control before
their growth was negatively impacted by the inhibitors,
cells treated with 10 µM TCS showed an immediate
growth inhibitory effect. Kinetic analysis revealed an
IC50 of 6.9 µM for TCS, 35.4 µM for C75, 23.5 µM for
orlistat, and 7.5 M for TOFA (Table 1) after treatment of
LNCaP cells for 48 h. Measurement of metabolic activity
/ viability of LNCaP cells treated for 48 h by Alamar Blue
assay revealed similar IC50 values (Table 1). Inspection
of the images from the time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1A)
revealed that TCS induced cell morphology changes in
LNCaP cells after 24 h which were similar to cells treated
with orlistat or TOFA, where cells were flat and enlarged
and highly granular. This phenotype was very similar to
the morphological changes induced by TCS in MCF-7
breast cancer cells [8]. In contrast, C75 caused cells to
round up with shortened processes.
Analysis of the cell confluence-derived IC50 values
at different time points revealed that TCS and TOFA
reached maximum potency in growth inhibition as early as
6 h post treatment, which remained relatively unchanged
over the 96 h incubation period (Fig. 1C). In contrast, C75

reached maximum potency (IC50=16.9 µM) after 72 h of
incubation, a two-fold increase relative to the IC50 at 6 h
(33.6 µM). A similar time-dependent increase of potency
was also observed with orlistat (data not shown).
FASN inhibition by TCS was also cytotoxic in
the PCa cell lines C4-2B (a castrate-resistent LNCaP
derivative), LAPC4, 22RV1 and the metastatic PCa cell
line PC-3 (Table 2). While TCS possessed similar IC50
values (4.5 µM to 7.8 µM) in the different PCa cell lines,
the potency of C75 varied by more than four-fold between
cell lines (8.3 µM to 35.4 µM). Interestingly, the nonmalignant prostate cell lines RWPE-1, BPH-1 and WPMY1 also displayed increased sensitivity to TCS and C75
(Table 2) and orlistat and TOFA (data not shown) when
compared to non-malignant 3T3 fibroblasts. Notably,
FASN is mainly expressed in adult hormone-sensitive cells
like prostate cells or in cells with high lipid metabolism
[24]. Consistent with our findings, concentrations of up
to 100 µM TCS or C75 showed no cytotoxic effects in the
non-malignant fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1 [18].
Previous work has shown that pharmacological
inhibition of FASN with C93, a C75 derivative, activates
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in SKOV3 human
ovarian cancer cells [11]. AMPK acts as a metabolic master
switch with a critical role in sensing cellular energy levels
and metabolic stress stimuli (reviewed in [25]). AMPK
activation through phosphorylation inhibits de novo FA
biosynthesis through phosphorylation and repression
of the lipogenic transcription factor, SREBP1, which
regulates the expression of FASN [11], androgen receptor
expression and PCa progression [26, 27]. In addition,
activated AMPK directly phosphorylates ACC, thereby
9366

inhibiting malonyl-CoA synthesis, the rate-limiting step of
de novo FA synthesis. Reduced malonyl-CoA levels in turn
activate mitochondrial FA β-oxidation through relieved
inhibition of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1)
[28]. Hence, we investigated the effects of the lipogenic
inhibitors TCS, C75, orlistat and TOFA on protein
expression and phosphorylation levels of FASN, ACC and
AMPK by Western blot analysis (Figs. 1D and 1E). As
positive controls, we treated LNCaP cells with metformin
or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside
(AICAR) which lead to phosphorylation and activation
of AMPK (reviewed in [25]). As shown in Figure 1D,
the four lipogenic inhibitors TCS (1.8-fold), C75 (2.3fold), orlistat (2.8-fold) and TOFA (2.9-fold) caused an
increase in AMPK phosphorylation which was similar to
metformin (2.2-fold) and AICAR (2.0-fold). Consistent
with increased AMPK activity, phosphorylation of ACC
(P-ACC) was increased by all three FASN inhibitors.
Interestingly, like metformin and AICAR, TCS and orlistat
decreased FASN protein levels. Yet, FASN expression
remained largely unchanged by C75 and TOFA. Western
Blot analysis of a time course experiment revealed that
TCS caused a decrease in FASN protein by 2.5-fold after
72 h, while C75 increased FASN protein by 1.5-fold (Fig.
1E). Taken together, inhibition of de novo lipogenesis
through pharmacological targeting of ACC or FASN
increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and its target
ACC. Importantly, the FASN inhibitors TCS, C75 and
orlistat, which target different partial catalytic activities of
FASN, had distinct effects on its protein levels.
Next we investigated whether the cytotoxic
effect of TCS, C75 and orlistat was caused through end
product starvation of palmitate. We performed a rescue
experiment where we supplemented TCS-treated LNCaP
cells with exogenous palmitate and measured growth in
real time (Fig. 1F). When compared to control, addition
of palmitate did not affect growth of LNCaP cells.
However, supplementation with exogenous palmitate
rescued the profound growth inhibition produced by TCS
(Fig. 1F). Similarly, exogenous PA recued the growth
inhibition induced by orlistat (Fig. 1F), which has been
reported previously in PC-3 cells [29]. Furthermore, TCStreated LNCaP cells did not display the above described
morphological phenotype (flat, enlarged and highly
granular cells) when co-treated with exogenous palmitate
(Fig. 1G). These results indicated that the anti-proliferative
and morphological effects of TCS were a result of end
product starvation which was mediated through FASN
inhibition. In contrast, C75-induced growth inhibition
of LNCaP cells could not be rescued by palmitate (Fig.
1F). This observation is consistent with a previous study
[30], which suggested that increased malonyl-CoA levels
might be the major cause for cytotoxicity of C75 [31].
Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the FASN
inhibitor TCS is a potent cytotoxic compound in PCa
cells. Furthermore, these results highlight that inhibition of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

different partial catalytic activities of FASN with different
inhibitors can produce distinct phenotypes regarding cell
morphology, expression levels of FASN and mechanism
of growth inhibition.

Triclosan, C75 and orlistat have different effects
on the expression of lipogenic genes
The above observed changes to FASN protein
levels by the inihibitors raised the possibility that these
effects were caused through transcriptional changes
via SREBP1. In addition, we investigated key genes
of FA synthesis (ACC and FASN) and FA metabolism
like FA uptake and transport (SLC27A1 and ACBP),
FA conversion (HSL/LIPE, ACSL5 and FADS-2), FA
β-oxidation (CPT-1), and arachidonic acid metabolism
(PLA2G6 and PTGS1) by quantitative real-time PCR
(Figs. 2A-2C). As shown in Figure 2A, TCS, C75 and
orlistat did not affect the mRNA expression of SREBP1
and ACC in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, TOFA led
to a significant upregulation of SREBP1 mRNA levels and
decrease in ACC expression (Fig 2A). More importantly,
TCS significantly reduced the gene expression of FASN,
whereas C75, orlistat and TOFA caused a significant
increase (Fig. 2A). In addition, the lipogenic inhibitors
displayed distinct effects on the transcript levels of FA
transporters SLC27A1 and ACBP, hormone-sensitive
lipase HSL/LIPE which hydrolyzes stored triglycerides to
free FAs, acyl-CoA synthase ACSL5, and FA desaturase
FADS-2 (Fig. 2B). We observed that both orlistat and
TOFA significantly decreased the expression of carnitine
palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1), which controls the ratelimiting step of FA β-oxidation. Of note was also the
opposite regulation of phospholipase PLA2G6 expression
by TCS compared to C75, orlistat and TOFA. PLA2G6
has been shown to play a role in the release of FA and
arachidonic acid from phospholipids [32]. Consistent with
a potential effect of orlistat and TOFA on the arachidonic
acid pathway, both inhibitors caused a strong decrease in
the expression of PTGS1, which catalyzes the conversion
of arachidonic acid into prostanglandin [33]. Acetyl-CoA,
the building block of FA synthesis, is also a substrate
of the mevalonate pathway, which is important for the
synthesis of cholesterol, sterols and other isoprenoids. The
FA and cholesterol synthesis pathways are coordinately
regulated by a feedback system mediated by SREBP1
and SREBP2 [34]. SREBP2 regulates the expression of
hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS) and
hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR),
two key enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. In addition,
previous work has shown that C75 and TOFA inhibited
sterol synthesis in primary hepatocytes [35]. Hence, we
tested if FA synthesis inhibition affected the expression
of SREBP2, HMGCS, and HMGCR by qRT-PCR (Fig.
2C). In contrast to TCS and C75, orlistat and TOFA caused
9367

a significant up-regulation in the expression of SREBP2,
HMGCS and HMGCR, suggesting that the latter two
inhbitors stimulate cholesterol synthesis in LNCaP cells
through a feedback mechanism. In summary, inhibition
of de novo FA synthesis with different ACC and FASN
inhibitors activates distinct transcriptional responses of
genes involved FA and cholesterol metabolism.

We next performed DNA content analysis by
FACS to measure the effect of different concentrations

treatment. Similar to previous studies in RKO colon
cancer cells [36] and A-375 melanoma cells [37], C75
increased the number of LNCaP cells in S phase and G2/M
of the cell cycle (Fig. 3A). We observed similar results in
PC-3 and LAPC4 cells (data not shown). Importantly, Ho
et al. showed that the G2/M arrest of A-375 melanoma
cells generated by C75 preceded induction of apoptosis
and DNA fragmentation [37], suggesting that C75 is
cytotoxic in proliferating cells. Consistent with this, C75
was more potent in fast growing PCa cell lines (PC-3 and
22RV1) when compared to slow growing LNCaP cells
(Table 2). Unlike C75, TCS (10 µM) and orlistat (40 µM)
led to an increase in the number of cells in G0/G1 and,
concomitantly, a reduction of S phase and G2/M cells
(Fig. 3A), suggesting a cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, which
was previously reported for orlistat in the breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-435 [38]. Consistent with the above
findings in LNCaP cells, TCS also caused a G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest in PC3 (Fig. 3B) and 22RV1 cells (data not
shown).
Compared to the control, treatment with 20 µM
TCS caused a 12-fold increase in the number of LNCaP
cells in the hypodiploid subG1 peak, which is indicative
of DNA fragmentation and cell death (Fig. 3A). For
comparison, 30 µM C75 and 40 µM orlistat increased
the number of cells in subG1 by six-fold and 11-fold,
respectively (Fig. 3A). Further subG1 analysis of titration
(Fig. 3C) and time course experiments with LNCaP
cells (Fig. 3D) showed that TCS induced cell death in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner. Similar results
were observed in PC-3 cells (data not shown). Importantly,
FACS analysis of the apoptosis marker phosphatidylserine
with Annexin V confirmed that TCS induced cell death
through apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner
in LNCaP (Fig. 3E) and PC-3 cells (data not shown).
Furthermore, immunoblotting with poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) antibody showed that TCS caused
PARP cleavage in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3F). Together, these
results demonstrate that TCS causes a G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest and induces apoptosis in PCa cells.
Consistent with the above findings that TCS caused
cytotoxicity predominantly through end product starvation
(Fig. 1F), androgen deprivation (Fig. 3G) or inhibition
of androgen signalling with the androgen receptor
antagonist bicalutamide (data not shown), which reduces
expression of the androgen receptor-regulated FASN
gene and lipogenesis [39, 40], increased the sensitivity of
LNCaP cells to TCS, as shown by a significant increase
in dead cells in the hypodiploid subG1 population when
compared to cells grown in the presence of the androgen
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 5% fetal calf serum
(Fig. 3G). Similar results were observed in androgensensitive 22RV1 cells (results not shown). Similarly, cotreatment with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
activator metformin, which leads to a robust reduction of
FASN expression and cellular lipid levels (Fig. 3H) via
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suppression of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1
[28], enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TCS in LNCaP
(Fig. 3H) and 22RV1 cells (data not shown), as indicated
by a substantial increase in dead cells (hypodiploid
subG1 population) when compared to TCS or metformin
treatment alone. Consistent with this, real-time live cell
imaging demonstrated that co-treatment of LNCaP cells
with TCS and the AMPK agonists metformin or AICAR
substantially enhanced the cytotoxic effect of TCS when
compared to the individual treatments (Fig. 3I). Taken
together, these results indicate that the levels of FASN
expression and lipogenesis are strongly correlated with
sensitivity of PCa cells to TCS.

Triclosan reduces the lipid content of LNCaP cells
To evaluate the effect of FASN inhibition by TCS
or C75 on the cellular lipid content, we stained LNCaP
cells with the lipophilic fluorescent dye, Nile Red.
The fluorescence intensity of Nile Red-stained cells is
linearly correlated with the lipid content [41]. Nile Red
displays different emission maxima, depending on the
hydrophobicity of the bound lipids [42]. For example,
when excited at 485 nm, Nile Red-stained neutral lipids
like triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, which are
the main contents of lipid droplets, fluoresce with an
emission maximum of ~520 nm, while polar lipids like
phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylserine, which are the main constituents of
lipid bilayers, have an emission maximum of ~620 nm.
As shown in Figure 4A, fluorescence microscopy revealed
that treatment of LNCaP cells with 10 µM TCS visibly
reduced the staining of neutral and polar lipids when
compared to control or cells treated with 30 µM C75 (Fig.
4A). Quantitative analysis of Nile Red-stained lipids in
LNCaP cells indicated that increasing concentrations
of TCS lowered the neutral and polar lipid content
by up to two-fold (Fig. 4B). This was in stark contrast
to the biphasic effect seen with C75, where increasing
concentrations from 5-30 µM caused a steady rise of the
lipid content, while C75 at 40 M reversed this stimulatory
effect. We repeated the measurement of cellular lipids with
LNCaP cells in which FASN expression and neutral lipid
levels were markedly upregulated through stimulation
of lipogenesis with the synthetic androgen mibolerone
[39, 40] prior to the addition of TCS (Fig. 4C). When
compared to control, androgen treatment increased the
neutral lipid content by almost 8-fold. Incubation with
10-20 µM TCS caused a decline in neutral lipids of up
to 2.5-fold, while only a modest reduction in the lipid
content was detected when treated with 40 µM C75 (Fig
4C). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the
FASN inhibitor TCS reduced the lipid content of LNCaP
cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

3). Kinetic analysis of the IncuCyte and Alamar Blue data
for TCSm treatment of LNCaP cells for 48 h with revealed
an IC50 of 52.6 µM and 60.8 µM (Table 3), respectively,
representing an 8 to 9-fold reduction in potency when
compared to TCS (6.9 µM and 6.6 µM). We also noticed
that TCSm did not induce the above described changes to
cell morphology, e.g. flat and enlarged cells with increased
granularity (results not shown), and 20 µM TCSm did not
reduce the neutral and polar lipid content of LNCaP cells
(Table 3). These results suggested that the hydroxyl group
of triclosan may be critical for its potency as a FASN
inhibitor, and prompted us to generate five derivatives for
preliminary structure-activity relationship studies (Table
3). The IC50 of the TCS analogs were determined in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LNCaP cells by live cell imaging (IncuCyte) and Alamar
Blue assay, and cellular lipid levels were measured by
Nile Red staining (Table 3). All analogs but TCS15 (3)
showed substantial losses in cytotoxic potency (Fig.
5C) and the ability to reduce cellular lipid levels (Table
3), respectively. Interestingly, LNCaP cells displayed a
biphasic dose response profile when treated with 10-20 µM
TCS15 (Fig 5D), where, unlike the parent compound (Fig.
1A), cytotoxicity was observed with a delay of 24 h post
treatment. We suggest that the inhibitory effect of TCS15
can be explained by hydrolysis of the phenolic acetate
to release the parent compound in the biological system.

chain-extended benzylic alcohol in place of the parent
phenol. Similarly, compounds TCS79 (7) and TCS79n2
(8), which bear chain-extended ester and carboxylic acid
functionality, respectively, did not maintain the inhibitory
activity of TCS. Analogs TCSm (2) and TCS11 (5), which
lack alcohol functionality showed very limited inhibitory
activity. Together, these results strongly suggest that the
activity of TCS is dependent on alcohol functionality of
the parent phenol.
As shown above, inhibition of FASN by TCS
increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC
and decreased FASN protein levels (Figs. 1D and 1E). To
determine if these molecular effects were correlated with
the cytotoxic effect of the TCS analogs, we treated LNCaP
cells for 24 h with 10 µM of the TCS analogs and analyzed
FASN, ACC and AMPK expression by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 5E). Notably, among the five analogs, only
TCS (Fig. 1A) and TCS15 (3) (Figs. 5C and 5D) inhibited
growth of LNCaP cells at this concentration. As shown
in Figure 5E, all TCS analogs caused a similar increase
in AMPK phosphorylation (1.5 to 2.1-fold), whereas
phosphorylation of ACC was increased the most by TCS
(3.9-fold) followed by TCS15 (2.7-fold). Similarly, FASN
expression was decreased the most by TCS (-1.8-fold) and
TCS15 (-1.4-fold), while the less cytotoxic analogs caused
only a modest change in FASN levels (-1.2 to 1.2-fold).
Taken together, these results suggest that TCS-induced
cytotoxicity is linked to a reduction in FASN protein
levels but does not correlate with the level of AMPK
phosphorylation. In summary, these results demonstrated
that the hydroxyl group is critical for the activity of TCS
in inhibiting cancer cell growth and reducing cellular lipid
levels and FASN expression.

Orlistat is also an irreversible inhibitor of the thioesterase
activity of FASN and decreases cell viability of PCa cells
by inducing apoptosis [29]. Its potential application for
cancer chemotherapy is limited by its poor solubility
and very low level of oral bioavailability (reviewed in
[44]). C75 is a synthetic analog of cerulenin and lacks the
unstable, highly reactive epoxy group [9]. FASN inhibition
by C75 induces apoptosis [45] and showed significant
antitumor activity with little adverse effects on normal
proliferating tissues, such as bone marrow, intestine,
skin, or lymphoid tissue [9]. However, studies in mice
revealed that C75 causes strong appetite suppression and
profound weight loss through direct activation of carnitine
O-palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1), thereby increasing FA
β-oxidation [10]. With regards to mechanism of action,
C75 is a unique FASN inhibitor since it targets the first
reaction step which is catalyzed by the β-ketoacyl synthase
partial activity, as well as inactivates the TCS-targeted
enoyl reductase and orlistat-targeted thioesterase partial
activities with similar rates [5].
Like C75 and orlistat [29, 45], FASN inhibition
by TCS ultimately caused cell death of LNCaP cells via
apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner
(Figs. 3A-3F). TCS was cytotoxic in five different PCa
cell lines with similar IC50s in the low micromolar
range (4.5-7.8 µM). Early structure-function relationship
analysis with a panel of seven TCS analogs suggested that
alcohol functionality of the parent phenol is critical for
cytotoxic potency (Fig. 5 and Table 3). In comparison,
C75 displayed cytotoxic potency that varied by more than
four-fold between PCa cell lines (8.3-35.4 µM, Table 2)
and appeared to be correlated with the proliferation rate
/ number of cells in S phase (data not shown). Indeed,
previous work has shown that C75 induces apoptosis of
MCF7 and A-375 during S phase [37], suggesting that
C75 is more potent in rapidly proliferating cancer cells.
Similar to previous reports [18], we found that TCS and
C75 were non-cytotoxic at up to 60 µM in non-malignant
NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Yet, our analysis showed considerable
cytotoxicity of TCS and C75 in the non-malignant
prostate cell lines BPH-1, RWPE-1 and WPMY-1, with
IC50s ranging between 0.74 M and 28.2 µM (Table 2).
A recent study described a similar observation, showing
that RWPE-1 cells were more sensitive to FASN inhibition
by siRNA or C75 than the malignant cell lines LNCaP,
DU145 or PC-3 [46]. Furthermore, TCS has been shown
to induce degeneration and atrophy of prostatic tissue
in rats after treatment for 60 days with a daily dose of
20 mg/kg [20]. Taken together, our observations suggest
that cells of prostatic origin are particularly sensitive
to FASN inhibition. We found no correlation between
FASN inhibitor sensitivity and the status of the androgen
receptor, PTEN, or p53 in the cell lines tested (results not
shown).

DISCUSSION
TCS has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval as a bactericide in personal hygiene products
(toothpaste, mouth rinse, handwash, soaps, deodorant)
and has been used since 1968. TCS has an established
safety profile, with minimal toxicity in rats, dogs, baboons
and humans, no significant weight loss is associated with
TCS treatment, and TCS is not a genotoxic or mutagenic
compound. TCS has excellent oral bioavailability and
stability in plasma (reviewed in [43]). Promising results
have shown previously that FASN inhibition by TCS
showed chemo-preventative activity in a rat mammary
carcinogenesis model [19]. In this study we evaluated
TCS, which inhibits the enoyl reductase domain of FASN
[8], as a repurposed drug against PCa cells and compared
its activity to C75 and orlistat, two well-known FASN
inhibitors whose clinical development are impeded
by various pharmacological limitations (reviewed in
[44]). Orlistat, a U.S. FDA-approved drug designed for
obesity, inhibits pancreatic lipase, thereby preventing
the absorption of free FAs from the diet in the intestine.

valuable kinetic information about potency, growth
inhibition and cell death (Fig. 1A). These observations
were validated by Alamar Blue assay which measures
cell viability based on metabolic activity (Table 1).
Interestingly, inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of
de novo FA synthesis, ACC, with TOFA or FASN with
TCS reached maximum potency in LNCaP cells as early
as 6 h after treatment commenced and remained relatively
unchanged over the entire incubation period (Fig. 1C).
This is in agreement with a significant rise in cell death
of LNCaP cells when treated for >6 h with TCS (Fig. 3D).
In contrast, the potency of C75 (Fig. 1C) and orlistat (data
not shown) to inhibit growth of LNCaP cells changed
by two-fold over the treatment period and required
up to 72 h to reach maximum potency. Importantly,
this analysis demonstrated that there were substantial
differences between the four inhibitors of de novo FA
synthesis (TOFA, TCS, C75 and orlistat) with regards to
growth profile and timing of growth inhibition at IC50
(Fig. 1A) and time-dependent maximum potency (Fig
1C), suggesting that they induced cytotoxicity through
different mechanisms, e.g., end product starvation or
accumulation of toxic levels of malonyl CoA substrate
or intermediates of palmitate synthesis. Indeed, rescue
experiments with exogenous palmitate showed that TCSand orlistat-induced cytotoxicity was largely caused by
end product starvation (Fig. 1G). This mechanism of
cytotoxicity was previously reported for orlistat in PC-3
cells [29]. Consistent with earlier work [30], C75-induced
growth inhibition of LNCaP cells could not be rescued
by palmitate (Fig. 1G), and it was suggested previously
that accumulation of toxic levels of malonyl-CoA caused
cytotoxicity of C75 [31]. This is a particularly interesting
observation, given that (i) C75 inactivates three partial
activities of FASN (β-ketoacyl synthase, enoyl reductase
and thioesterase) with similar rates [5], (ii) inhibition
of the enoyl reductase activity by TCS and thioesterase
activity by orlistat cause cytotoxicity predominantly
through end product starvation (Fig. 1G) and (iii) TCSmediated inhibition of the enoyl reductase activity was
suggested to increase the concentration of the enoyl
thiolester intermediate, which strongly resembles the
two β-ketoacyl reductase inhibitors, CM-55 and C75 [8].
Hence, it will be interesting to address biochemically in
future work how inactivation of various partial catalytic
activities of FASN contribute to overall cytotoxicity
through accumulation of potentially toxic metabolites.
In addition to the cause of cytotoxicity by end
product starvation, TCS-mediated inhibition of FASN
generated phenotypes in LNCaP cells with regards to cell
morphology (Fig. 1B), cell cycle (Fig. 3) and expression
of FASN protein (Fig. 1D) that resembled the effects seen
with orlistat, which were distinctively different to C75.
Of note was our discovery that TCS caused a significant
reduction in FASN gene (Fig. 2) and protein expression
(Figs. 1D and 1E) in LNCaP cells, while C75 led to an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase. FASN gene expression was also increased by
orlistat and TOFA. Yet, gene expression of the lipogenic
transcription factor SREBP1 remained unchanged by
the FASN inhibitors TCS, C75 and orlistat, while it was
increased two-fold by TOFA. In addition, we discovered
that the lipogenic inhibitors caused distinct changes to the
expression of genes involved in FA uptake and transport
(SLC27A1 and ACBP), FA conversion and remodeling
(HSL/LIPE, ACSL5 and FADS-2), FA β-oxidation (CPT1), and arachidonic acid metabolism (PLA2G6 and
PTGS1) (Fig. 2), suggesting the activation of different
feedback mechanisms. This was further exemplified by
the significant upregulation of key genes of cholesterol
synthesis (SREBP2, HMGCS and HMGCR) by orlistat
and TOFA but not TCS and C75.
We also observed that inhibition of de novo
FA synthesis with four different inhibitors targeting
ACC (TOFA) and FASN (TCS, C75, orlistat) caused
a substantial increase in AMPK phosphorylation. Yet,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of FASN protein by 94%
after 96 h did not change AMPK phosphorylation (data not
shown). Furthermore, the levels of AMPK phosphorylation
did not correlate with cytotoxic potency, FASN inhibition
and reduction of cellular lipids, as shown by the inactive
TCS analogs (Table 3). These observations suggest
that AMPK phosphorylation was not directly induced
by a reduction in de novo FA synthesis, and that other
canonical or non-canonical pathways might be responsible
for AMPK activation, e.g. xenobiotic or oxidative stress
(reviewed in [25, 47]). Furthermore, while metformin- and
AICAR-induced upregulation in AMPK phosphorylation
caused an expected and proportional increase in ACC
phosphorylation, we noticed that this was not the case with
the lipogenic inhibitors (Fig. 1D).
Previous work has shown that 7.9–39.4 µM C75
substantially reduced incorporation of [U-14C]acetate
via inhibition of de novo synthesis into acylglycerides
(80%) and FAs (50%) in HL60 cells without affecting
phospholipid synthesis [9]. Interestingly, C75 caused
a biphasic effect on total neutral and polar lipid content
(Fig. 4), which is the sum of lipids derived from de novo
synthesis and recycling pathways. 5-30 µM C75 increased
the neutral lipid content of LNCaP cells, while 40 µM C75
suppressed this stimulation to base line levels (Fig. 4B).
Previous work in CHO-K1 cells has shown that C75induced cellular stress caused lipid droplet biogenesis and
metabolic synthesis of triacylglycerol through recycling
of structural phospholipids [48]. In contrast, TCS reduced
cellular lipid levels in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figs. 4B and 4C), suggesting that TCS affected the FA
recycling pathway differently. Furthermore, preliminary
structure-function relationship studies with seven TCS
analogs demonstrated that the reduction of cellular
lipid levels was correlated with cytotoxic potency and
dependent on alcohol functionality of the parent phenol,
respectively.

Androgen ablation therapy (ADT) has been the
standard treatment for metastatic PCa for decades, and
treatment of type II diabetes with the AMPK activating
drug metformin has been shown to improve patient
outcomes in PCa (reviewed in [49]). Moreover, a recent
study of the novel AMPK activator MT 63-78 provided a
rationale for blocking lipogenesis through the combined
targeting of AMPK and the androgen receptor in advanced
PCa [50]. Consistent with these reports, we found that
ADT and treatment with the AMPK activators metformin
and AICAR, which cause a reduction of FASN gene and
protein expression and lipogenesis, sensitized LNCaP cells
to FASN inhibition by TCS (Figs. 2G-2I), suggesting that
combination therapy of FASN inhibitors with ADT and/or
AMPK activators (metformin, AICAR, MT 63-78) might
improve the clinical outcome of PCa patients.
In this comparative study we discovered that TCS
is a superior alternative to C75 and orlistat in inducing
cell death of PCa cells via inhibition of FASN. Strikingly,
inhibition of different partial catalytic activities of
FASN generated distinct phenotypes with regards to
cell morphology, cell cycle, total lipid content, and the
expression of FASN and key genes of FA and cholesterol
metabolism, highlighting the need for further studies of
the mechanism of action of the cytotoxicity-inducing
molecule(s), i.e. malonyl-CoA, intermediates of FA
synthesis, depletion of palmitate. The known safety
profile of TCS and its chemo-preventative antitumorigenic
activity warrant further characterization of TCS in a preclinical setting to address its efficacy in inhibiting PCa
xenograft tumor growth. Thus, TCS-mediated inhibition
of the metabolic oncogene FASN has promising potential
for therapeutic development for advanced PCa.

6-well plates in phenol-red free RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 5% FBS for 48 h. After treatment
for 48 h with TCS or C75, cells were harvested with
trypsin, washed with 1 ml of PBS and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed
again with 1 ml of PBS and finally resuspended in 0.2
ml of PBS. For androgen treatment, cells were seeded at
8.0 x 104 cells per well in 6-well plates and processed as
described above. A 96-well plate was set up with 40 µl of
cell suspension in a total volume of 100 µl with PBS, and
lipids were stained with Nile Red at a final concentration
of 0.5 µg/ml. For normalisation, 40 µl of cell suspension
in a total volume of 100 µl with TE (10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) was mixed with 0.5 µl of QuantiT PicoGreen DNA stain (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence of Nile Redstained neutral lipids (485 nm/520 nm) and polar lipids
(485 nm/620 nm) and Quant-iT PicoGreen-stained DNA
(485 nm/520 nm) was measured in a FLUOstar Omega
plate reader (BMG Labtech). Fluorescence intensities were
normalized according to the DNA content and calculated
as fold-changes relative to control. For analysis by flow
cytometry, cells were seeded and harvested as described
above and directly stained with Nile Red (0.5 µg/ml). The
median fluorescence intensity of 20,000 cell events was
measured at 520 nm with a FITC filter on a FACSCanto
(BD Biosciences).

Flow cytometry
Cells were seeded at 2.0 x 105 cells per well in
6-well plates in phenol-red free RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 5% FBS for 48 h. After treatment
for 48 h with TCS or C75, cells were harvested with
trypsin, washed with 1 ml of PBS and fixed in 1 ml of
70% ethanol for 60 min at -20°C. Cells were washed in 1
ml of PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS supplemented
with 10 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) and 30 µg/
ml DNAse-free RNAse A (Sigma) and incubated over
night at 4°C. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCanto
(BD Biosciences), where 20,000 events were counted after
exclusion of cell doublets and polyploid cell populations.
DNA histograms were analyzed with ModFit LT (Verity
Software House). For the detection of apoptosis, samples
were prepared as above except that cells were not fixed in
70% ethanol. Instead, 1 x 105 cells were resuspended in 1
x Annexin V binding buffer (10 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) containing 2 µl of 0.15 mg/
ml FITC-conjugated Annexin V (BioVision) and PI at 5
µg/ml and incubated for 5 min in the dark. After electronic
compensation, FITC and PI fluorescent intensities were
measured for 20,000 cell events on a FACSCanto (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed with FACSDiva software (BD
Biosciences).

Oncotarget

RNA was obtained using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was prepared from 2 µg total RNA with Superscript III
(Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) on a 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA
expression levels were calculated according to the ΔΔCt
method and normalized relative to the expression levels
of the house keeping gene (RPL32) of the respective
treatment and expressed as fold change relative to the
control (DMSO). Statistical significance was analyzed
with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) by one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests. The sequences of the
primers used are listed in the Supporting Information.
