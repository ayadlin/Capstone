One of the most conserved features of all cancers is a profound reprogramming of cellular metabolism, favoring biosynthetic
processes and limiting catalytic processes. With the acquired knowledge of some of these important changes, we have designed a
combination therapy in order to force cancer cells to use a particular metabolic pathway that ultimately results in the accumulation
of toxic products. This innovative approach consists of blocking lipid synthesis, at the same time that we force the cell, through the
inhibition of AMP-activated kinase, to accumulate toxic intermediates, such as malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) or nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate. This results in excess of oxidative stress and cancer cell death. Our new therapeutic strategy,
based on the manipulation of metabolic pathways, will certainly set up the basis for new upcoming studies deﬁning a new
paradigm of cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Metabolic changes are key early events during cellular transformation. Increased glycolytic ratio, high lactate production and
augmented de novo lipid synthesis have been well documented in
most types of cancer. Most adult normal cells and tissues, even
those with high cellular turnover, preferentially use circulating
fatty acids (FAs) for the synthesis of new structural and signaling
lipids. In contrast, it is now well documented that various tumors
and their precursor lesions, including prostate cancer (PC),
undergo exacerbated endogenous FA biosynthesis, irrespective
of the levels of extracellular lipids. These speciﬁc metabolic
features of cancer cells have been used to deﬁne new metabolic
targets for cancer therapy. Abrogation of lipid synthesis through
inhibition of lipogenic enzymes, such as the FA synthase (FASN),1,2
ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase
(ACC)3 or stearoyl-CoA desaturase,4 results in decreased
proliferation and increased apoptosis of cancer cells (reviewed
in Fritz and Fajas5). The cytotoxic effects of these experimental
therapies are probably secondary to the inhibition of the
synthesis of speciﬁc lipids, such as phosphatidyl inositols, or
phosphatidic acids, which are essential for cancer cell growth. In
addition, accumulation of toxic intermediates could also account
for the observed increase in apoptosis of cancer cells. Indeed, it
has been suggested that the cytotoxicity induced by FASN
inhibition may be the result of malonyl-CoA accumulation,
which is a toxic intermediate.6,7 In addition, inhibition of
lipid synthesis has a strong impact on general metabolism. For
instance, de novo lipogenesis requires nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is generated by the
1

pentose phosphate pathway, or by malate dehydrogenases and
malic enzyme, as a cofactor for the synthesis of palmitate by FASN.
Inhibition of lipid synthesis will therefore result in the
accumulation of NADPH, which can be transformed in reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells.
In this study, we used a new therapeutic approach based on the
previous observation that malonyl-CoA accumulation results in
apoptosis of cancer cells. We hypothesized that inhibition of
malonyl-CoA utilization, as a substrate for palmitate synthesis,
through blocking of FASN activity, together with the induction of
the activity of ACC, which produces malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA,
would result in further accumulation of malonate and therefore
increased apoptosis of PC cells. Hyperactivity of ACC was achieved
through inactivating AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and inhibits ACC activity.
Here we show that this experimental approach resulted
not only in the accumulation of malonyl-CoA but also in the
activation of NADPH-producing ME, which leads to a cytotoxic
generation of NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent oxidative stress,
ultimately resulting in the abrogation of tumor growth in a mice
model of PC.

RESULTS
Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition induces malonyl-CoA
accumulation in PC cells
Malonyl-CoA accumulation has been previously shown to be toxic
for cancer cells.6 During de novo lipid synthesis, malonyl-CoA is
produced from acetyl-CoA precursor by ACC and then converted

Figure 1. Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition induces malonyl-CoA accumulation in PC cells. The AMPK and FASN inhibitors’ concentration
used in all in vitro experiments were as follows: cC 1 mg/ml, araA 0.5 mM and C75 7 mg/ml, unless otherwise indicated. (a) Immunoblot analysis
of phospho (p)-AMPK and p-ACC in PNT2, LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3 cell lines at 24 h following treatment with increasing concentration of AMPK
activators AICAR or metformin (Metf.). (b) Immunoblot analysis of p-AMPK, total AMPK, p-ACC and tubulin in the LNCaP cell line at 24 h
following treatment with either 1 mg/ml cC alone, 5–7 mg/ml C75 alone or with cC combined to increasing C75 concentrations. (c) Lipid
synthesis through [14C]palmitate incorporation into TAG was measured in C4-2 cells at 24 h following treatment with either cC, C75 or
cC þ C75 (left panel). Basal lipid synthesis levels were quantified in normal prostate PNT2 cells compared with C4-2 and PC-3 PC cells.
(d) Cellular contents in malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA were measured in PNT2, LNCaP or C4-2 cells at 24 h following treatment with either cC,
C75 or with combined cC þ C75 treatment.

to palmitic acid by the FASN enzymatic complex. ACC activity is
inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation. Inhibition of AMPK should
therefore result in increased ACC activity and increased malonylCoA synthesis. Furthermore, concomitant inhibition of FASN
should result in decreased malonyl-CoA utilization, and overall
malonyl-CoA accumulation. Before testing this hypothesis, we ﬁrst
analyzed the status of AMPK activity in non-tumoral PNT2 and
tumoral LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3 human prostate cell lines, under
control culture conditions or in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the AMPK activators AICAR or metformin.
AMPK activity was evaluated by assessing the phosphorylation
status of the AMPK activation loop (Thr172) and its direct substrate
ACC (Ser79). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated basal AMPK
activity in non-tumor and tumor cell lines, probably secondary to
cell culture stress conditions (Figure 1a). Treatment of the cells
with AICAR and metformin revealed, however, robust increases of
phospho-AMPK and phospho-ACC levels, suggesting increased
AMPK activity. Interestingly, increased AMPK activity, as measured
by changes in ACC phosphorylation, was signiﬁcantly higher in the
more aggressive PC cell lines C4-2 and PC-3, compared with
normal prostate cell line PNT2 or hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells
(Figure 1a).
We next tested the hypothesis that concomitant inhibition of
FASN and AMPK would result in malonyl-CoA accumulation and
overall decreased de novo lipid synthesis in these cells. Treatment
of LNCaP PC cells with compound C (cC) signiﬁcantly decreased
AMPK activation, as demonstrated by decreased phosphorylation
(Figure 1b). Consistently, cC treatment efﬁciently inhibited ACC
phosphorylation. Total AMPK levels were not changed in response
to cC. Treatment of PC cells with C75 showed no impact on AMPK
and ACC phosphorylation, whereas treatment with cC combined
with C75 decreased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation to a similar
extent compared with cC alone (Figure 1b). Consistent with the
inhibition of FAS activity, treatment of the cells with C75 in the
absence or presence of cC resulted, as expected in inhibition of
de novo lipid synthesis, in PC cells (Figure 1c, left panel).
Oncogene (2013) 5101 – 5110

[14C]acetate was used by the cells to synthesize FAs, which are
subsequently incorporated into TAGs. All cancer cell lines tested
showed a decrease of 14C incorporation in TAGs (Figure 1c). Most
interesting was the observation that de novo lipid synthesis was
almost not detectable and strongly decreased in the noncancerous prostate cell line PNT2 (Figure 1c, right panel). This
suggested that the toxic effects of the treatment should not be
observed in normal cells, compared with PC cells, because nontumor prostate cells do not have active lipid synthesis. This will be
demonstrated in the following ﬁgures.
Interestingly, combined C þ C75 treatment induced signiﬁcant
increase of both malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA levels in PC LNCaP
cells (Figure 1d). The observation that in C4-2 cells individual
treatments resulted only in mild increases in malonyl-CoA
accumulation is intriguing, although a signiﬁcant increase in
malonyl-CoA levels was observed in cells co-treated with cC and
C75 (Figure 1d). In contrast, a robust accumulation of acetyl-CoA
was observed when C4-2 cells were treated with either C75 or the
combination treatment. This suggested that unexpected mechanisms activated the conversion of malonyl into acetyl-CoA in
response to FASN inhibition in these cells. Despite this,
concomitant inhibition of FASN and AMPK activities results in
the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, which is a toxic metabolite for
the cell.
Combination treatments of AMPK and FASN inhibition abrogate
PC cell growth and viability in vitro
Combination treatments were now tested for the effects on
proliferation and cancer cell growth and viability. Inhibition of
AMPK activity by cC treatment induced a signiﬁcant decrease in
cell proliferation in LNCaP (38%), C4-2 (33%) and PC-3 (32%) PC
cells (Figure 2a). Similarly, inhibition of FASN induced a block in
the proliferation of these cells, whereas the combined treatment
with cC and C75 resulted in a further inhibition of cell proliferation,
reaching 78%, 84% and 85% in LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3 cells,

Figure 2. Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition blocks PC cells’ proliferation in vitro and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis. (a) Effects of
cC and C75 inhibitors on LNCaP and C4-2 cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting at the indicated times. (b–e) Genetic inhibition of
AMPK in PNT2, LNCaP and C4-2 cells was performed by nucleofaction with siRNA against hAMPKa1/2. Reduced AMPKa1/2 expression is
shown by AMPKa1/2 immunoblotting (b) in LNCaP cells 24 h after transfection with control or siRNA against hAMPKa1/2. (c) Proliferation of
sicont- or siAMPKa1/2—PNT2, LNCaP or C4-2 cells was measured by cell counting following treatment with control or C75-supplemented
media at the indicated times. (d) Effect on cell viability was analyzed by FACS by measuring the percentage of annexin V-FITC þ cells at 16 h
following treatment with control or C75-supplemented media at the indicated times. Rescue from apoptosis induction was analyzed following
pre-treatment of cells with 20 mM qVD-oph caspase inhibitor. (e) Effect on cell viability was analyzed by FACS by measuring the percentage of

respectively, at 72 h. The speciﬁcity of the measure effect was
conﬁrmed by using another AMPK inhibitor, adenine 9-b-Darabinofuranoside (AraA). Indeed, we showed that combined
AraA þ C75 treatment resulted in 80%, 77% and 84% in LNCaP, C42 and PC-3 cells, respectively, at 72 h (Figure 2a). In contrast, PNT2
cell proliferation was much less sensitive to the inhibition of AMPK
activity by either cC or AraA. PNT2 cell proliferation was also
decreased, but to a less extent than tumoral PC cells, at 72 h
following cC þ C75 treatment or AraA þ C75 treatment (Figure 2a).
Similar to that observed using AMPK inhibitors, genetic AMPKa1/2
inhibition using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, which
reduced AMPKa1/2 protein expression (Figure 2b), resulted in 35%
and 21% decrease of LNCaP and C4-2 tumor cell proliferation,
respectively, but in only 10% decrease of non-tumoral PNT2 cell
proliferation (Figure 2c). Upon addition of C75, proliferation of
AMPKa1/2 knockdown LNCaP or C4-2 cells was markedly
decreased by 62 and 75%, although proliferation of sicont.-LNCaP
or C4-2 cells was decreased by 27% and 27%, respectively, as
compared with control culture media. In contrast, upon addition
of FASN inhibitor C75, proliferation of sicont- and siAMPKa1/2PNT2 cells was reduced by 60% and 65%, respectively, at 72 h,
indicating that AMPK does not have a crucial role in proliferation
in non-tumoral PC cells, as compared with that observed in PC
cells. This indicated that the effects of cC are mediated by AMPK.
Malonyl-CoA accumulation has been previously shown to
induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The combined treatment using
AMPK and FASN inhibitors is efﬁcient in malonyl-CoA

accumulation, which correlated with decreased viability of the
cells. We therefore tested the effects on apoptosis of this
treatment. The combination of cC and C75 inhibitors induced a
signiﬁcant 4.7- and 2-fold increase in the percentage of LNCaP and
C4-2 cells positive for annexin V-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC),
respectively, as compared with control, reﬂecting externalization
of phosphatidylserine during early apoptosis (Figure 2d).
Similarly, combination treatment of AraA and C75 induced a
signiﬁcant 3- and 2.2-fold increase in the percentage of LNCaP and
C4-2 cells positive for annexin V-FITC. Moreover, the caspase
inhibitor qVD-oph efﬁciently abrogated the effects of cC þ C75 or
AraA þ C75 co-treatment on apoptosis (Figure 2d). In sharp
contrast, only 5% of PNT2 cells were stained positive for annexin
V-FITC following treatment with either C75 alone or with cC þ C75
or AraA þ C75 co-treatments, indicating that combined AMPK and
FASN inhibition does not affect non-tumoral PNT2 cell viability.
Moreover, cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining indicated the
activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis in PC but not in
PNT2 cells following AMPK and FASN inhibition by treatment with
either cC þ C75 or AraA þ C75 (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, cytochrome c immunostaining in C4-2 cells following
cC þ C75 or AraA þ C75 treatment was diffuse and funter
indicative of apoptotic induction, although it was intense and
punctate in PNT2 cells, indicating that it has not been released
from the mitochondria (Supplementary Figure 1).
Similar to that observed using AMPK inhibitors, the percentage
of apoptotic annexin V-FITC þ cells was signiﬁcantly induced by

Figure 3. Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition reduces tumor growth in mice. (a–c) Tumor volume progression of subcutaneously implanted
LNCaP (a), C4-2 (b) and PC-3 (c) cells in nude athymic mice was measured weekly following intraperitoneal injection with 10 mg/kg of either
cC alone, C75 alone or both cC and C75 for 5 days a week. Values are expressed as the mean tumor volume (mm3)±s.e.m. (n ¼ 5 for each
group) from day 1 to day 14. (d) Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining of C4-2 tumor sections. (e) Quantification of cycling Ki67 þ cells
on C4-2 tumor sections. Six fields per section were analyzed for Ki67 immunostaining indicative of cell proliferation. Sections of tumors of all
mice were analyzed. At least 300 cells were counted per tumor. (f ) The lipidic composition was analyzed in total lipids extracted from C4-2
tumor tissues. Values are expressed as fold of control (mean±s.e.m.).

3.9-fold in siAMPKa1/2 as compared with sicont-LNCaP cells, and it
was further increased to 4.7- and 6-fold in siAMPKa1/2 LNCaP and
siAMPKa1/2 C4-2 cells, respectively, upon addition of C75. In sharp
contrast, only 1.4- and 1.5-fold increases of annexin V-FITC staining
were induced in sicont.- and siAMPKa1/2-PNT2 cells treated with
C75 as compared with the control media.
Combinations of AMPK and FASN inhibition abrogate PC cell
growth in a mouse model of PC
Inhibition of cancer cell growth was further proved by in vivo
experiments using a mouse model of PC. LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3
cells were injected subcutaneously in male athymic nude mice.
Treatment of each individual mouse started when tumor nodules
were measurable. We observed that treatment of mice with
10 mg/kg of either cC alone, C75 alone or a combination of cC and
C75 signiﬁcantly inhibited both androgen-dependent LNCaP
(Figure 3a) and androgen-insensitive C4-2 (Figure 3b) and PC-3
(Figure 3c) tumor volume and tumor growth rate, as compared
with control mice that received vehicle only. Early efﬁciency of
cC þ C75 combined treatment was evidenced in LNCaP, C4-2 and
PC-3 tumor xenografts by a 80%, 47% and 37% decrease,
respectively, in mean tumor volume as soon as day 7, reaching
89%, 67% and 65% at day 14, as compared with the control group.
In contrast, cC individual treatment induced signiﬁcant tumor
volume decrease only by day 14 in LNCaP, C4-2 and PC-3
xenografts, whereas C75 individual treatment induced signiﬁcant
tumor volume decrease (60%) by day 7 only in LNCaP tumor
xenografts (Figures 3a–c). On day 7 of treatment, we observed
that C4-2 tumor volume was increased more than twofold in 63%
of vehicle-treated mice and more than threefold in 50% of them,
whereas this was observed only in 20% of cC þ C75-treated mice
(Figure 3b). These results suggested that the combination of
AMPK and FASN inhibition has cytotoxic effects that result in the
abrogation of tumor growth in vivo.
Oncogene (2013) 5101 – 5110

Immunostaining of tumors from C4-2 xenografts for the cell
cycle entry-associated marker Ki67 further supported the efﬁciency of combined cC þ C75 treatment to inhibit tumor cell
proliferation with an average 73% decrease of Ki67 þ cells in
tumors, compared with tumors from control animals (Figure 3e).
Importantly, the decrease of Ki67 þ cells was associated with an
increase of cleaved caspase-3 þ cells in C4-2 tumors from animals
treated with cC þ C75, as compared with animals that received
control or single treatments (Figure 3d). This indicates that
combined AMPK and C75 inhibition may induce apoptosis in PC
tumors in vivo. We next investigated whether the reduction of
tumor growth following combined AMPK and FASN inhibition was
associated with changes in FA composition in vivo. Analysis of
total lipids extracted from tumor tissues revealed an overall
decrease in lipid content in mice receiving cC þ C75 treatment, as
compared with control mice, and more speciﬁcally a signiﬁcant
decrease in palmitate (16:0) (24%), stearate (18:0) (34%), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) (30%) and DHA (22:6n-3) (29%) FAs’ contents
(Figure 3f). This suggested that the observed effects of cC þ C75
treatment on tumor growth are mediated, at least in part, by
inhibition of lipid synthesis.
Importantly, no signiﬁcant weight loss or other toxicity was
observed in mice following daily intraperitoneal injections of cC
and or C75 (Supplementary Figure 2). Histological examination
conﬁrmed the absence of toxicity in the liver, and no difference of
tissue integrity between control and treated animals (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, hematocrit analysis revealed normal
erythropoiesis in treated vs control animals (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Increased ME1 activity mediates the effect of AMPK and FAS
inhibition on PC cell proliferation
We next asked how AMPK inhibition could decrease tumor growth
and induce apoptosis in the context of blocked lipid synthesis.

Figure 4. Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition in PC cells is associated with an increased ME activity. (a) Induction of the SREBP-1
transcriptional activity following cC þ C75 co-treatment was assessed by measuring firefly Luc activity in LNCaP cells overexpressing SREBP-1
and FAS-Luc promoters, as compared with control. Values are expressed as relative luciferase unit (RLU) normalized relative to the bgalactosidase activity. (b) Variations in mRNA expression levels of SREBP-1 target genes G6PDH, ATP-citrate lyase, ME1 and malate
dehydogenases (Mdh)-1 and -2 were analyzed by RT-qPCR in LNCaP cells at 24 h following indicated treatments. (c) Induction of the ME1
transcriptional activity following cC þ C75 co-treatment was assessed by measuring Renilla luciferase (Luc) activity in LNCaP and C4-2 cells
overexpressing ME1-Luc promoter, as compared with control. Values are expressed as relative luciferase unit (RLU) normalized relative to the
b-galactosidase activity. (d) Induction of ME enzymatic activity in whole LNCaP cells was analyzed by spectrophotometry in the presence of
NADPH substrate at 24 h following indicated treatments. (e) Rescue from the antiproliferative effect of cC þ C75 treatment in LNCaP cells was
conducted by genetic inhibition of ME1. ME mRNA and protein expression is indicated. (f ) Quantification of the percentage of BrdUincorporating cells transfected with siRNA against ME1, as compared with control.

AMPK is known to inhibit SREBP-1 activity, which regulates the
expression of genes implicated in lipid synthesis, and also genes
implicated in the generation of ROS, such as the glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Indeed, SREBP-1 transcriptional activity was induced 4.4- and 3.6-fold at 12 h following cC
and cC þ C75 treatment, respectively (Figure 4a), in LNCaP cells,
consistent with an inhibitory effect of AMPK on SREBP activity.
Moreover, mRNA expression of the SREBP-1 target genes G6PDH
and ATP-citrate lyase was induced 1.4- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in
LNCaP cells after 24 h of cC treatment (Figure 4b). No further
induction in the expression of these genes was observed when
cells were co-treated with cC þ C75 or when the expression of
malate dehydogenases 1 and 2 was analyzed. In contrast, ME1
mRNA level was further increased up to 4.4-fold when cells were
treated with the cC þ C75 combination treatment, compared with
the 2.8-fold increase observed with each individual treatment
(Figure 4b). The increase in ME1 mRNA concentration correlated
with the induction of the ME1 promoter (Figure 4c) and with
signiﬁcant changes in ME enzymatic activity (Figure 4d) upon
treatment. Importantly, the pre-treatment of cells with the caspase
inhibitor qVD-oph had no effect on measured ME activity
following the different treatments (Figure 4d). Similar results were
obtained in C4-2 and PC-3 cells (data not shown). These results
suggested that ME1 activity was mediating, at least in part, the
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

proapoptotic effects of the treatment. To test this hypothesis, ME1
was silenced in LNCaP cells using speciﬁc siRNA, which highly
decreased ME1 expression (Figure 4e). ME1 genetic inhibition had
no signiﬁcant impact on cell proliferation in control conditions,
whereas ME1 siRNA rescued proliferation in cells treated with
cC þ C75 as measured by the percentage of bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU)-incorporating cells (Figure 4f). These results suggested that
the increase in ME1 activity contributes to the antiproliferative
effects of combined AMPK and FASN inhibition on PC cells.
Accumulation of NADPH, NOX activity and oxidative stress in PC
cells treated with AMPK and FASN inhibitors
ME1 catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate concomitantly
generating NADPH from NADP. Increased ME1 activity (Figure 4d)
was fully consistent with the accumulation of NADPH in cells
treated with the combination of FASN and AMPK inhibitors
(Figure 5a). In cells, NADPH is either used to support FASNmediated lipid synthesis or is used as a substrate for the NOX,
which generates ROS. NOX converts oxygen into superoxide
radicals (O2  ), which are then converted into hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) by superoxide dismutase. As expected, a signiﬁcant 2.5-fold
increase of NOX activity was measured in cells following treatment with cC þ C75 (Figure 5b), which was correlated to a 2.2- and

Figure 5. Combined AMPK and FASN inhibition in PC cells is associated with an increased NOX activity and associated ROS production.
(a) NADPH on NADP cellular ratio was measured in LNCaP cells by colorimetric assay at 48 h following indicated treatments. (b) NOX activity
was measured by chemiluminescence in the presence of NADPH substrate and lucigenin at 24 h following indicated treatments. (c) NOX1 and
-2 isoforms mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR at 24 h following indicated treatments. (d, e) FACS analysis of cellular ROS production
measuring superoxide radicals (O2  ) and H2O2 with DHE (d) and DCFDA (e) fluoroprobes, respectively. (f ) Co-treatment of cells with 2 mM NOX
inhibitor DPI abrogated cC þ C75-induced ROS increase, as measured with DCFDA fluoroprobe by FACS analysis. (g) Rescue from NOX1 mRNA
level induction following cC þ C75 treatment was measured by RT-qPCR following LNCaP cell transfection with siRNA against ME1, as
compared with control.

9.8-fold induction, respectively, of NOX1 and NOX2 mRNAs
(Figure 5c). A subsequent increase in oxidative stress in response
to cC þ C75 treatment was demonstrated by a threefold increase
in the level of superoxide (Figure 5d) and a twofold increase in the
level of H2O2 (Figure 5e), which was consistent with the increased
NOX activity. These results suggested that NOX contributed to
ROS generation in PC cells following combined FAS and AMPK
inhibition. To test this hypothesis, LNCaP cells were pretreated
with diphenyliodonium (DPI), which is a known NOX inhibitor,
before cC þ C75 treatment. Analysis of ROS production indicated
that DPI pre-treatment selectively abrogated the effects of cC þ
C75 co-treatment on H2O2 overproduction, further demonstrating
that NOX activity leads to oxidative stress in these cells in
response to the combination treatment (Figure 5f). Moreover,
genetic inhibition of ME1 in LNCaP cells by siRNA blocked NOX1
mRNA upregulation following cC þ C75 co-treatment, strongly
suggesting that NADPH production by ME1 activity stimulated
NOX activity in PC cells (Figure 5g).
AMPK and FASN inhibition results in the inhibition of cell
proliferation and induction of apoptosis in PC cells through
NOX-dependent increased oxidative stress
Increased ROS production in response to AMPK and FASN coinhibition was associated with oxidative stress in PC cells, as
demonstrated by the augmentation of lipid peroxidation measured on cellular extracts from LNCaP treated with both cC and
C75 (Figure 6a). Oxidative stress was also associated with an
upregulation of the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as
peroxidase-1, peroxidase-2 or catalase (Figure 6b). To evaluate the
implication of ROS overproduction in apoptosis induction following AMPK and FASN inhibitions, LNCaP cells were treated with
various antioxidant agents before cC and C75 treatment. Thus,
ascorbic acid blocked the induction of ROS generation by cC þ
C75 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6c). ROS
production was also signiﬁcantly reduced by pre-treatment with
the antioxidant Trolox (Figure 6c). Interestingly, inhibition of ROS
production by antioxidant treatment signiﬁcantly rescued cell
viability (Figure 6d) and abrogated cC þ C75-induced apoptosis in
Oncogene (2013) 5101 – 5110

LNCaP cells (Figure 6e). Strikingly, inhibition of NOX activity by DPI
also abrogated cC þ C75-induced apoptosis in these cells
(Figure 6f). These results suggested that the oxidative stress,
induced by NOX activity, induces apoptosis in cancer cells.
Altogether, these results suggested that, in the context of AMPK
and FASN co-inhibition, the excess of generated oxidative stress
resulting from increased NOX activity leads to apoptosis in PC
cancer cells.
DISCUSSION
Cancer cell metabolism is an emerging target for cancer
therapeutics. Here we have designed an original experimental
therapy that considers metabolic pathways as a very dynamic
system that ultimately adapts to speciﬁc stress conditions and
substrate utilization. On the basis of our results, we propose a new
concept in cancer therapy that we call metabolic bioengineering.
It is founded in the observation that some speciﬁc metabolic
pathways are well deﬁned in cancer cells, and that by using
inhibitors of speciﬁc reactions we can take control of cells’
metabolism and direct it toward a particular output of toxic
products. Our approach is represented in Figure 7. Cancer cells, in
contrast to normal cells, depend on lipid synthesis pathways for
survival. Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of lipid
synthesis using FASN inhibitors hampers cancer cell growth and
proliferation.8,9 It was demonstrated that these effects are
mediated by the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, which blocks
CPT1-mediated FA b-oxidation, leading to the accumulation of
ceramide and other proapoptotic lipids (reviewed in Menendez
and Lupu10). In addition, malonyl-CoA accumulation results in the
upregulation of the transcription factor PEA3, which represses the
expression of ERBB2, thus abrogating this oncogenic signaling
pathway.11 In this scenario, we designed a combination therapy
aiming to force cancer cells to accumulate high levels of malonylCoA. We show that co-treatment of cells with FASN and AMPK
inhibitors results in additive accumulation of malonyl-CoA in
cancer cells. Inhibition of FASN results in decreased malonyl-CoA
utilization, whereas inhibition of AMPK ultimately results in the
activation of ACC1, and consequently more malonyl-CoA synthesis

Figure 6. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of AMPK and FASN inhibition in PC cells are mediated by a NOX-dependent ROS
overproduction. (a) The presence of oxidative stress as a consequence of ROS overproduction following cC þ C75 treatment was analyzed by
measuring the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substrates (Tbars), indicative of lipid peroxidation, on LNCaP cellular extracts. Values
are expressed as mM of malonaldehyde and normalized to protein content. (b) The mRNA expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes
peroxidase (Perox)-1 and -2 and catalase, as measured by RT-qPCR, were compared following LNCaP treatment, as indicated. (c–e) Protective
effects of antioxidants on ROS production (c), cell proliferation (d) and apoptosis (e) in cC þ C75-treated LNCaP cells was conducted by 2-h
pre-treatment with increasing amounts of the antioxidants ascorbic acid (AA) and Trolox, as indicated. (c) Rescue of ROS overproduction in
cC þ C75-treated LNCaP cells was assessed by FACS analysis by measuring H2O2 content with DHE fluoroprobe following treatment with
increasing doses of antioxidants. (d) Rescue of cC þ C75-treated LNCaP cell proliferation was measured by XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay at 48 h following co-treatment with increasing amounts of antioxidants. (e) Rescue of
cC þ C75-treated LNCaP cells from apoptosis induction was measured by FACS analysis of annexin V-FITC þ cells at 16 h following cotreatment with increasing amounts of antioxidants. (f ) Rescue of cC þ C75-treated LNCaP cells from apoptosis induction by 6-h co-treatment
with 2 mM NOX inhibitor DPI was measured by FACS analysis of annexin V-FITC þ cells.

Figure 7. Hypothetical mechanism underlying the proposed metabolic therapy. Inhibition of AMPK, in the context of inactive FASN, influences
several metabolic pathways. First, AMPK inhibition activates ACC-mediated malonyl-CoA formation, the accumulation of which has apoptotic
effects. Second, AMPK inhibition results in the activation of SREBP and of ME and G6PDH enzymes, resulting in the accumulation of NADPH.
Moreover, FASN inhibition leads to further accumulation of NADPH, which is not used as a substrate for de novo lipids synthesis. As the NOX
enzyme is also activated as a result of AMPK inhibition, excess of NADPH substrate will be converted into ROS. Altogether, this results in an
increased apoptosis in cancer cells.

(Figure 7). We showed that accumulation of this lipid precursor
results in increased cancer cell death. It is important to stress that
the toxic effects of lipid synthesis inhibition are speciﬁc of cancer
cells, as we showed that de novo lipid synthesis pathways are at
very low levels in non-cancer prostate cells (Figure 1c and Fritz
et al.4). We also show, however, that inhibition of FASN alone has
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

effects in cell proliferation or apoptosis despite the low
accumulation of malonyl-CoA. FASN inactivation is already a
potent anti-lipogenic effect. De novo FA biosynthesis is required
for cancer cells to synthesize new membranes, to generate
signaling molecules, such as phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl
serine or phosphatidyl choline, which are important factors to

5108
activate proliferative and survival pathways. We can therefore
hypothesize that FASN inhibition by itself could lead to these
effects independent of malonyl-CoA accumulation.
As our experimental approach is based on the inhibition of
AMPK, we further explored the mechanisms underlying the effects
of AMPK inhibition in the context of blocked lipid synthesis. AMPK,
in addition to blocking ACC1, is also known to inhibit SREBP-1
activity. We showed, consequently, that co-treatment increased
the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1, as well as the expression
and activity of some of the tested SREBP-1 target genes, in
particular ME or G6PDH. Previous studies using transgenic mice
overexpressing SREBP isoforms evidenced a marked increase of
mRNAs for NADPH-producing enzymes, such as ME or G6PDH.12,13
In the context of concomitant lipid synthesis inhibition, this has
several connotations. First, SREBP-1 target gene activation, such as
ME or G6PDH, results in the generation of NADPH species in the
cell. Under normal conditions, NADPH would be used by FASN as a
cofactor for lipid synthesis, whereas under FASN inhibition
conditions, such as that used in our study, NADPH would
accumulate (Figure 7). AMPK also inhibits NOX enzymes, which
convert NADPH into ROS, thus generating oxidative stress.
Strikingly, NOX activity was increased secondary to AMPK
inhibition in PC cells. We showed that increased NADPH and ME
activity was translated into NOX-dependent increase of ROS,
which correlated with increased apoptosis in these cells (Figure 7).
It is known that ROS generation promotes cancer cell development, but excess ROS is also toxic for cancer cells. Recent studies
have shown the therapeutic potential of agents that increase
cellular ROS levels to selectively kill cancer cells.14 Overall, we
created in these PC cells a synergistic accumulation of apoptotic
signals, that is, malonyl-CoA accumulation and ROS generation, by
using the ‘metabolic bioengineering’ approach. Considering the
complexity of metabolic pathways, we strongly believe that
many other strategies using similar approaches will emerge in the
near future.
We show here that AMPK inhibition results in proliferation arrest
and apoptosis of cancer cells, whereas AMPK activation is regarded
as an emerging therapy for cancer treatment.15 To explain this
apparent paradox, we have to consider the effects of AMPK in the
proper context. AMPK activators are mimicking energy deprivation
in cancer cells, thus inhibiting biosynthetic processes, including cell
proliferation. Moreover, under energetic stress conditions, such as
that observed in cancer cells, AMPK activation can have a protective
effect against apoptosis and facilitate cancer cell survival.16 In
addition, AMPK activation could be required for the observed
metabolic switch in cancer cells (reviewed in Viollet et al.17). Finally,
AMPK may protect cancer cells from oxidative stress.18 When lipid
synthesis pathways are inhibited, the antiproliferative effects of
AMPK activation are, however, lost. Furthermore, in this scenario,
inhibition of AMPK forces the system toward the generation of
oxidative stress, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death, as we have
demonstrated.
In conclusion, a better knowledge of metabolic pathways in
cancer cells will facilitate the design of targeted therapies that we
prove promising for the treatment of cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, transient transfections and RNA interference
experiments
The benign PNT2 prostate epithelial cell line was obtained from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier,
France). The androgen-sensitive LNCaP and the androgen-independent
C4-2 human prostate carcinoma cell lines were purchased from Viromed
Laboratory Inc. (Minnetonka, MN, USA). The metastatic androgenindependent PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell lines were kindly provided by
Dr Patrick Balaguer (IRCM, Montpellier, France). Monolayer cell cultures
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Cergy, France)
Oncogene (2013) 5101 – 5110

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) at
37 1C in 5% CO2. The transcriptional activity of SREBP-1 was analyzed by
performing transient co-transfections with 0.25 mg SREBP-1 or control
vector and 0.25 mg FASN promoter luciferase (Luc) reporter or control
vector. The transcriptional activity of ME1 was analyzed by performing
transient transfections with 0.25 mg ME1 promoter Luc reporter (LightSwitch Luciferase) or control Luc vector (SwitchGear Genomics, Menlo Park,
CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Renilla luciferase
activities in cell lysates were normalized relative to the b-galactosidase
activity to correct for differences in transfection efﬁciency. For siRNA
experiments, transfection of LNCaP or C4-2 cells was carried out with predesigned ON-TARGET plus smart pool siRNA oligonucleotide control or by
targeting the human AMPKa1/2 (IDT, Paris, France) or the human ME1
sequence (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA). Nucleofaction of cells with
2.5 mg of siRNA was performed on 2  106 cells using the Amaxa
nucleofactor R kit (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). At 24 and 48 h after
transfection, cells were processed for cell proliferation by cell counting or
BrdU staining and harvested for annexin staining or RNA analysis.

Animal experiments
Male athymic nude mice (Foxn1nu/nu) (Harlan, Grannat, France) were used
at the age of 6–7 weeks (weight 25–30 g). All procedures were performed
in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of
Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimentation (animal house agreement no.
B-34-172-27, authorization for animal experimentation no. 34.324). Animals
were killed before they became compromised. Xenografts were established by subcutaneously injecting 2  106 LNCaP, C4-2 cells or PC-3 in
100 ml of Matrigel solution. For curative experiments, tumors were allowed
to grow until they were measurable with a caliper. In each group, the mice
were randomized according to their established tumor volume and given
either the AMPK inhibitor cC at 10 mg/kg, the FASN inhibitor C75 at 10 mg/
kg or both cC and C75 inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich) at 10 mg/kg, in 100 ml of a
Labraﬁl-DMA-Tween-80 solution (89:10:1) (treated group) or vehicle alone
(control group), by daily intraperitoneal injections 5 days a week. Tumor
volume measurements were taken two to three times a week and
calculated according to the following formula: length  width 
height  0.5236. Data are expressed as the mean tumor volume±s.e.m.
Experiments were carried out at least two times for each tested condition.
Mice were bled at the retro-orbital sinus for hematocrit analysis. At the
time of killing, tumors were excised and either ﬁxed in 4% formalin for
immunohistological analysis or prepared for FA analysis.

Quantitative real-time PCR
For gene expression analysis following treatment of cells with different
inhibitors, RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative (q) realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were carried out as described
previously.4 qPCR was conducted on the ABI Prism 7300 Sequence
detection System software (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies SAS,
Villebon sur Yvette, France), using the SYBR Green Light Cycler Master Mix
(Euroﬁns MWG Operon, Roissy CDG, Italy) and the oligonucleotides speciﬁc
for human G6PDH, ATP-citrate lyase, ME1, malate dehydrogenase-1 and -2,
NOX1 and -2, peroxidase-1 and -2 isoforms and catalase. Values are
expressed as the relative mRNA level of speciﬁc target gene normalized to
18S levels, as obtained using the formula 2  (DCt).

Malonyl-CoA measurement
Quantiﬁcation of malonyl-CoA concentration in whole-cell lysates from
PNT2, LNCaP and C4-2 cells was realized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (antibodies online.com). Brieﬂy, subconﬂuent cell cultures
grown in 6-well plates were treated for 24 h with cC and/or C75 inhibitors,
and whole-cell lysates were subjected to several freeze–thaw cycles and
then centrifuged. Malonyl-CoA in the supernatant was detected by speciﬁc
biotin-conjugated antibody on pre-coated 96-well plates and revealed with
avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Values are expressed as nM
malonyl-CoA and were normalized to total protein content (mean±s.e.m.).

Acetyl-CoA measurement
Concentration of acetyl-CoA in whole-cell lysates from PNT2, LNCaP and
C4-2 cells was measured by ﬂuorescence assay using a commercial kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Abcam). Values are

Measurement of de novo FA synthesis

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Subconﬂuent cultures of PNT2, LNCaP, C4-2 or PC-3 cells grown in 6-well
plates were treated overnight with cC and/or C75 inhibitors in serum and
FA-free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.2%
bovine serum albumin. Cultures were then labeled in triplicate with 1.0 mCi
of [14C]acetate for 6 h. Total lipids were extracted two times with 5 ml of
Folch mixture (chloroform:methanol, 2:1 (v/v)) and 500 ml of water,19 and
then dried under gaseous nitrogen. Labeled lipids were then subjected to
TLC in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid 90:10:1 (v/v) to separate cholesterol
ester, triglycerides and phospholipids. Air-dried plates were scanned on a
PhosphorImager, and FA spots on TLC were analyzed with the Typhoon
9200 PhosphorImager software (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare
Europe, Velizy-Villacoublay, France). Values were normalized to protein
contents and areas are expressed as mean±s.e.m.

Immunohistochemical analyses of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 expression
were performed on 5 mM parafﬁn-embedded sections of C4-2 tumor
xenografts. Brieﬂy, after antigen retrieval, deparafﬁnized sections were
blocked for Fc receptors with PBS containing 5% goat serum and then
incubated with the corresponding anti-Ki67 rabbit antibody (1:500; Abcam,
Strasbourg, France) or cleaved caspase-3 rabbit antibody (1:500; Cell
Signaling, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France) in PBS-Tween 0.1%, overnight at
4 1C. Staining was revealed with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1:100; Jackson Immunoresearch, Interchim, Montlucon, France) and with the DAB chromogen (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as
substrate. Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin.

FA analysis
Total lipids from C4-2 tumors xenografts were extracted three times with
folch mixture, converted to fatty methyl esters as described previously4
and subjected to gas chromatography identiﬁcation. Gas chromatography
was conducted with a Thermo GC ﬁtted with a ﬂame ionization detector. A
supelcowax-10 fused silica capillary column (60 m  0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 mM
ﬁlm thickness) was used, and the oven temperature was programmed
from 50 to 200 1C, increased 20 1C/minute, held for 50 min, increased 10 1C/
min to 220 1C and held for 30 min. Values were normalized to tissue weight
and are expressed as mean±sem.

Proliferation assay
Proliferation of LNCaP or C4-2 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h following the
addition of inhibitors in dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl sulfoxide alone at
the indicated doses was determined by cell counting using an
hematocytometer, as described previously.4

XTT proliferation assay
LNCaP or C4-2 cells were seeded in triplicate 96-well dishes containing 104
cells per well. At 48 h after treatment with inhibitors in dimethyl sulfoxide
or dimethyl sulfoxide alone, the enzymatic reduction of tetrazolium salt
XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide; Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France) to formazan was quantiﬁed
by optical density reading at 490 nm in each well, and normalized with a
reference wavelength at 650 nm in a microplate reader.

BrdU staining
The percentage of proliferative BrdU-incorporating LNCaP and C4-2 cells
was measured as described previously.4

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of apoptosis and ROS
production
Induction of apoptosis in subconﬂuent LNCaP or C4-2 cells following 16 h
treatment with either 1 mg/ml cC, 7 mg/ml C75 or both cC þ C75 inhibitors
was determined by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis by
measuring the percentage of FITC-conjugated annexin V þ cells as
described previously.4 Caspase inhibition was achieved by adding
20 mmol/l of caspase inhibitor qVD-oph (MP Biomedicals SARL, Illkirch,
France) 30 min before the apoptotic stimuli. Induction of ROS in
subconﬂuent LNCaP or C4-2 cells following a 6-h treatment with either
1 mg/ml cC, 7 mg/ml C75 or both cC þ C75 inhibitors was determined by
FACS analysis by measuring he production of cellular superoxide (O2  )
and H2O2 using the ﬂuoroprobes dihydroethidium (DHE) at 2 mM and
carboxy-H2DCFDA (DCFDA) at 10 mM, respectively. To analyze the effects of
antioxidants on apoptosis and ROS production, cells were pre-treated for
2 h with increasing doses of ascorbic acid (from 50 to 200 mM) or Trolox
(from 50 to 100 mM) and then incubated with cC, C75 or both cC þ C75 in
the presence of antioxidants. To analyze the effects of NOX inhibition on
apoptosis induction and on ROS production, LNCaP or C4-2 cells were pretreated for 2 h with NOX inhibitor DPI at 2 mM and then incubated for an
additional 4 h with either cC 1 mg/ml, C75 7 mg/ml or both cC þ C75 in the
presence of DPI. FACS experiments were performed using a Becton
Dickinson FACScalibur with 488-nm laser excitation, and analyzed with the

Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemical analysis of cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome C
expressions were performed on PNT2, LNCaP, and C4-2 cells grown on
coverslip. Brieﬂy, after ﬁxation in 4% PFA and permeabilization with 0.5%
Triton X-100, cells were incubated with blocking buffer (PBS- 1% BSA).
Cleaved caspase-3 expression staining was detected with an cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175) rabbit primary antibody, 1:500 (Cell signaling) for 2
hour at 37 1C and revealed with a Alexa Fluor 488nm-labeled goat antirabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch), 1:500 for 45 min at
37 1C. Then cytochrome C expression staining was detected with an
cytochrome C mouse primary antibody, 1:40 (BD Pharmingen) overnight at
4 1C and revealed with a Alexa Fluor 594 nm-conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch), 1:500 for 45 min at 37 1C.
In the last wash, cells were labeled with with dapi for 5 min at room
temperature. Slides were mounted in mowiol and analyzed rapidly.

Lipid peroxidation
Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the formation of
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substrates in LNCaP cellular extracts. Concentrations were measured against a standard curve obtained with
malonaldehyde. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substrate values were
expressed as mM malonaldehyde/mg protein.

Protein extracts and immunoblot analysis
Protein extracts and sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransfer and immunoblotting were carried out as
described previously.20 The primary antibodies rabbit anti-AMPK, rabbit
anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172), rabbit anti-phospho-ACC (Ser79) and rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Ozyme, Saint Quentin Yvelines, France). The primary antibody rabbit antiME1 was purchased from Abcam. The primary antibody mouse antitubulin-a was purchased from Lab Vision (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Microm
France, Francheville, France).

Determination of ME activity
ME activity was determined as described previously,21 with some
modiﬁcations, by measuring the ﬂuorescence associated with the
generation of b-NADPH during conversion of L-malate to pyruvate in the
presence of b-NADP, according to the reaction: L-malate þ b-NADPpyruvate þ CO2 þ b-NADPH. Brieﬂy, protein extracts (50 mg) were added to
a 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mM MnCl2, 20 mM NADP þ and
100 mM malate, in a cuvette positioned inside a temperature-controlled
chamber maintained at 25 1C. Fluorescence was measured with a 340-nm
excitation and 460-nm emission on a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer.
Values are expressed as ABS/min/mg proteins.

Determination of NADPH cellular content
NADP and NADPH concentrations were determined on fresh LNCaP or C42 cellular extracts by colorimetric assay using the EnzyChrom TM NADP þ /
NADPH Assay Kit (Gentaur, Paris, France), as described by the
manufacturer.

Determination of NOX activity
NOX activity was measured in whole LNCaP or C4-2 cells by using
lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence as described previously, with some

modiﬁcations.22 Brieﬂy, 5  105 cells were diluted in 200 ml of 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
and 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. A volume of 180 ml of the
reaction mixture containing 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 150 mM
sucrose, 100 mM NADPH and 5 mM lucigenin was immediately added to 20 ml
of the cell suspension in a dark-adapted 96-well plate, and
chemiluminescence was measured at 8-s intervals for 20 min. Data are
expressed as mean relative luciferase units.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean±s.e.m. of triplicates. Figures show
representative results of at least two independently performed experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired Student’s t-test.
Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at Po0.05 (*Po0.05,
**Po0.01 and ***Po0.001).
