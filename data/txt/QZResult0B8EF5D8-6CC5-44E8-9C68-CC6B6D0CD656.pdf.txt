Abstract
The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs) during life is
associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer1,2. Extreme variation in cancer risk
across tissues was recently proposed to depend on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to
unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication1. However, the rates and patterns
of mutations in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation
patterns in ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3

to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary multipotent cells3–5. Our
results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time in all of the assessed tissue types, at a
rate of approximately 40 novel mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence
among these tissues1. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those of
the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this difference can be
attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues in the colon and small
intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yetunknown underlying mechanism is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show
high similarity to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational
processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual variation in mutation
rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific activity of common mutational processes
throughout life.

It has not yet been possible to measure somatic mutation loads in ASCs from specific human
tissues. However, such knowledge could be valuable in understanding tissue homeostasis
and repair capacities as well as ASC vulnerabilities to extrinsic factors. The accumulation of
mutations as life progresses is thought to underlie the genesis of age-related diseases such as
cancer6 and organ failure2. Mutations acquired in the genomes of multipotent ASCs are
believed to have the largest impact on the mutational load of tissues, owing both to their
potential for self-renewal and capacity to propagate mutations to their daughter cells1,2.
Consistently, cancer-initiating mutations in intestinal ASCs lead to tumour formation within
weeks, whereas these mutations fail to drive intestinal adenomas when induced in
differentiated cells7. Unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication in
normal ASCs have recently been proposed to impart a large influence on cancer risk1.
Consequently, tissues with a high ASC turnover would show higher cancer incidence when
compared to tissues with low ASC proliferation rates1,8. However, computational modelling
has suggested that the variation in ASC proliferation rate alone cannot exclude extrinsic risk
factors as important determinants of organ-specific cancer incidence9. Yet, the number of
mutations that accumulate during the lifespan of normal human ASCs with different
turnover rates has, to date, not been directly determined and compared. To understand tissue
homeostasis and tissue-specific susceptibility to cancer and ageing-associated diseases it is
important to assess mutation accumulation in ASCs of different tissues.
Here, we experimentally define ASCs as those cells that give rise to long-term organoid
cultures and have the potential to differentiate into multiple tissue-specific cell types3–5. To
catalogue the in vivo-acquired somatic mutations in individual normal human ASC
genomes, we used an in vitro system to expand single ASCs into epithelial organoids, which
reflect the genetic make-up of the original ASC (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Methods). This
procedure allowed us to obtain sufficient DNA for accurate whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) analysis, while circumventing the high noise levels associated with single-cell DNA
amplification10. We assessed ASCs from the small intestine, colon and liver, tissues that
differ greatly in proliferation rate and cancer risk1. Cancer incidence is much higher in the
colon compared to the small intestine and liver1. We sequenced 45 independent clonal
organoid cultures derived from 19 donors ranging in age from 3 to 87 years (Extended Data
Table 1). In addition, we sequenced a blood or polyclonal biopsy sample of each donor to

identify and exclude germline variants. Subclonal mutations, which must have been
introduced in vitro after the single-cell step, were discarded based on their low variant-allele
frequency (Extended Data Figs 1b–d, 2 and Methods). Overall, we identified 79,790
heterozygous clonal somatic point mutations and subsequent extensive validations showed
an overall confirmation rate of approximately 91% (Extended Data Figs 1, 3).

A positive correlation (t-test linear mixed model; P < 0.05) between the number of somatic
point mutations and the age of the donor could be observed for all organs (Fig. 1a and
Extended Data Fig. 4), indicating that ASCs gradually accumulate mutations with age,
independent of tissue type. Notably, we found that the annual mutation rate in ASCs was in
the same range for all assessed tissues, despite the dissimilar cancer incidence in these
tissues; ASCs of the colon, small intestine and liver accumulate around 36 mutations per
year (95% confidence intervals are 26.9–50.6, 25.8–43.6 and 11.9–60.1, respectively; Fig.
1b). The mutation spectra in small intestinal and colon ASCs were very similar, but differed
markedly from liver (Fig. 1c). Notably, the mutation spectrum within tissues did not differ
between young and elderly donors (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Genome-wide mutation patterns in the ASCs provide insights into the mutational and DNA
repair processes that are active in different organs11. Using non-negative matrix
factorization12, we extracted three mutational process signatures (Fig. 2a and Methods). All
of these signatures were previously described in a pan-cancer analysis11. Signature A
(corresponding to signature 5 in ref. 11), characterized by T:A to C:G transitions, was the
main contributor to the mutation spectrum observed in the liver and was also clearly present
in the small intestine and colon (Fig. 2). Although the underlying mutational process
remains unknown, the number of mutations attributed to this signature that accumulate with
age resembles a linear trend in all tissues (Fig. 2b). This suggests that this signature
represents a universal genomic ageing mechanism (that is, a chemical process acting on
DNA molecules) independent of cellular function or proliferation rate.
The majority of the somatic mutations observed in small intestinal and colon ASCs could be
attributed to signature B (corresponding to signature 1A in ref. 11), which is characteristic of
spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues into thymine at CpG sites (Fig.
2a). The resulting T:G mismatch can be effectively repaired, but the mutation is incorporated
if DNA replication occurs before the repair is initiated13. In line with this, high rates of
signature B mutations are observed in many cancer types of epithelial origin with high cell
turnover13. This process showed a minimal contribution to the age-related mutational load
in liver ASCs (Fig. 2c), which is likely to reflect the relatively low division rate of these cells
during life. Finally, contribution of a third signature, signature C (corresponding to signature
18 in ref. 11), was minimal in all tissues and did not correlate with age (Fig. 2b). Sequential
clonal ASC expansions in culture followed by WGS analysis showed that in vitro-induced
mutations are predominantly characterized by this signature (Extended Data Fig. 6 and
Methods).
Signature B mutations were strongly associated with the timing of replication and
predominantly present in late-replicating DNA (Extended Data Fig. 7) even though the
majority of CpG dinucleotides are located in early-replicating DNA. This bias suggests that

this mutagenic process is more active in late-replicating DNA or, alternatively, that
replication-coupled repair shows reduced activity in late-replicating DNA14. Consequently,
somatic mutations in small intestine and colon ASCs were strongly enriched in latereplicating DNA and depleted in early-replicating DNA (Fig. 3a, b). In addition, somatic
point mutations in small intestine and colon ASCs were depleted in H3K27ac (histone H3
acetyl Lys27)-associated DNA and enriched in H3K9me3 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys9)associated DNA (Fig. 3a), similar to patterns previously observed in cancer15. As genic
regions are predominantly located in early-replicating DNA and open chromatin, we
observed a depletion of mutations in exonic sequences (Fig. 3a). This demonstrates that
genome-wide mutation rates and spectra cannot be reliably estimated using mutation
discovery in reporter genes16, such as the T-lymphocyte HPRT cloning assay17, or by deep
sequencing of genic regions18–21. To test whether the depletion of coding mutations was
caused by selection against cells with damaging mutations, we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) taking into account the mutation spectra and
sequence composition (see Methods)18. We did not observe negative selection for nonsynonymous mutations (Extended Data Fig. 7f), arguing against the negative selection of
cells with damaging protein-coding mutations.

In liver ASCs, somatic mutations are more randomly distributed throughout the genome and
are less associated with replication timing or chromatin status (Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, a
comparable depletion of exonic mutations was observed in all tissues (Fig. 3a), suggesting
that liver ASCs use different mechanisms to maintain genetic integrity in functionally
relevant regions. Signature A, the most predominant in liver ASCs, shows little bias towards
DNA-replication-timing dynamics, but a pronounced transcriptional-strand bias11
(Extended Data Fig. 7), consistent with activity of transcription-coupled repair22. In line
with this, point mutations in the genic regions of the assessed ASCs showed a significant
transcriptional strand bias, exemplified by the more frequent occurrence of T:A to C:G
transitions on the transcribed strand compared to the untranscribed strand (Fig. 3c).
Our results indicate that a stable balance between the degree of DNA damage and the
subsequent repair is maintained throughout life in various ASC types, since mutations
accumulate steadily and display a constant mutation spectrum. Earlier work in mice using
mutation-discovery in a LacZ reporter gene, showed major age-related changes in mutation
spectra in different tissues23. The difference between these observations could be explained
by the comprehensive genome-wide analysis applied here to ASCs, whereas reporter assays
assess specific genes predominantly in differentiated cells. Although variation in tissuespecific mutation spectra in mice has been reported previously23–25, we observed a
difference in both mutation rate and spectrum in human cells (Extended Data Fig. 8). This
indicates that mutation data derived from mice are not necessarily suitable for interpreting
mutational processes and their consequences in humans.
Although we analysed cells from many different donors without controlling for lifestyle
differences or gender, the point-mutation rate and spectrum were highly similar between
individuals within organs. This suggests that incidental exposure to environmental
mutagenic factors has minimal effect on the point-mutation landscapes in normal ASCs of
the organs we assessed. Cell-intrinsic mutational processes, such as deamination-induced

mutagenesis in rapidly cycling ASCs, seem to be more important determinants of pointmutation load. Indeed, many colorectal cancer mutations in the driver genes APC, TP53,
SMAD4 and CTNNB1 are C:G to T:A transitions at CpG dinucleotides, whereas liver
cancer driver mutations in the same genes have a completely different spectrum (Fig. 4a).
However, ASCs of the colon and small intestine show very similar age-related mutation
characteristics, although cancer incidence is extremely low in the human small intestine1,9.
In addition to somatic point mutations, we evaluated the presence of somatic structural
variants (Fig. 4b–e and Extended Data Table 2). We detected small deletions (91–443 kb) in
3 out of 14 small intestinal ASCs and a larger deletion (2 Mb) in one ASC. Notably, colon
ASCs showed complex and larger chromosomal instability in 4 out of 15 colon ASCs,
including a complex translocation (Fig. 4d) and a trisomy (Fig. 4e). These events are
characteristic of segregation errors that can occur during cell division, and are a hallmark of
many colorectal cancers26. In addition, other factors, such as tissue clonality or external
agents may also contribute to the difference in cancer incidence between colon and small
intestine.
Here we have shown that ASCs of organs with different cancer incidences gradually
accumulate mutations at similar rates, but that the mutation profiles are tissue-specific. In the
ASCs of the tissues assessed here, mutation accumulation is primarily driven by a
combination of proliferation-dependent mutation incorporation following spontaneous
deamination of methylated cytosine residues and another process with a currently unknown
underlying molecular mechanism. Notably, the former intrinsic, unavoidable mutational
process can cause the same types of mutation as those observed in cancer driver genes. We
have shown that, at least in colon ASCs, this class of mutations could have a role in driving
tumorigenesis.

Methods
No sample-size estimate was calculated before the study was executed. The experiments
were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments
and outcome assessment.
Human tissue material
Endoscopic, colorectal and duodenal biopsy samples were obtained from individuals of
different ages that had been admitted for suspected inflammation. One individual (donor 1)
showed no inflammation during colonoscopy, but was later diagnosed with microscopic
colitis. The other individuals were found to be healthy based on standard histological
examination. Endoscopic biopsies were performed at the University Medical Center Utrecht
and the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital. The patients’ informed consent was obtained and
this study was approved by the ethical committee of University Medical Center Utrecht.
Additionally, normal tissue was isolated from resected colon segments at >5 cm distance
from a tumour in three colorectal cancer patients (donors 3, 4 and 19). The colonic tissues
were obtained at The Diakonessen Hospital Utrecht with informed consent and the study
was approved by the ethical committee. Liver biopsies (0.5–1 cm3) were obtained from
donor livers during transplantations performed at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam.

Establishment of clonal ASC cultures

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Dissociated colon and small intestinal crypts were isolated from the biopsies and cultured
for 1 - 2 weeks under conditions that are optimal for stem-cell proliferation, as previously
described5. Liver cells were isolated from human liver biopsies and cultured as previously
described3. From these cultures, single cells were sorted by flow cytometry and clonally
expanded (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Clonal ASC cultures were subsequently established by
manual picking of individual organoids derived from single cells and in vitro expansion for a
period of ~6 weeks.
Whole-genome sequencing and read alignment
DNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were generated using standard protocols (Illumina)
from 200 ng - 1 μg of genomic DNA isolated from the clonally expanded ASC cultures with
genomic tips (Qiagen). The libraries were sequenced with paired-end (2 × 100 bp) runs
using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencers to a minimal depth of 30× base coverage. Samples of
donors 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 19 were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq X Ten
sequencers to equal depth. The reference samples, blood or biopsy, were sequenced
similarly. Sequence reads were mapped against human reference genome GRCh37 using
Burrows–Wheeler Aligner v0.5.9 mapping tool27 with settings ‘bwa mem -c 100 –M’.
Sequence reads were marked for duplicates using Sambamba v0.4.7 (ref. 28) and realigned
per donor using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) IndelRealigner v2.7.2 and sequence
read-quality scores were recalibrated with GATK BaseRecalibrator v2.7.2. Alignments from
different libraries of the same ASC culture were combined into a single BAM file.

Point mutation calling
Raw variants were multi-sample (per donor) called using the GATK UnifiedGenotyper
v2.7.2 (ref. 29) and GATK-Queue v2.7.2 with default settings and additional option
‘EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES’. The quality of variant and reference positions was
evaluated using GATK VariantFiltration v2.7.2 with options ‘–filterExpression “MQ0 ≥4
&& ((MQ0 / (1.0 * DP)) > 0.1)”–filterName “HARD_TO_VALIDATE”–filterExpression
“QUAL < 30.0 “–filterName “VeryLowQual”–filterExpression “QUAL > 30.0 && QUAL <
50.0 “–filterName “LowQual”–filterExpression “QD < 1.5 “–filterName “LowQD”’.
Point mutation filtering
To obtain high-quality catalogues of somatic point mutations, we applied a comprehensive
filtering procedure (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We considered variants that were passed by
VariantFiltration and had a GATK phred-scaled quality score ≥100. Subsequently, for each
ASC culture, we considered the positions with a base coverage of at least 20× in both the
culture and the reference sample (blood or biopsy). Furthermore, we only regarded variants
at autosomal chromosomes. We excluded variant positions that overlapped with singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SNP database (dbSNP) v137.b37 (ref. 30).

Furthermore, we excluded all positions that were found to be variable in at least two of three
unrelated individuals (that is, donor 5, 6 and X (not in study)) to exclude recurrent
sequencing artefacts. To obtain somatic point mutations, we filtered out all variants with any
evidence of the alternative allele in the reference sample. We validated the clonal origin of
the sequenced ASC cultures by analysing the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of the
somatic mutations. Two cultures (donor 14, cell b and donor 17, cell c) showed a shift in the
peak of the somatic heterozygous mutations to the left, indicating that they did not arise
from a single stem cell, and were therefore excluded from the analysis (Extended Data Fig.
2). Finally, for all cultures we excluded point mutations with a VAF < 0.3 to exclude
mutations that were potentially induced in vitro after the (first) clonal step (Extended Data
Fig. 1b–d). The number of mutations that passed each filtering step for the samples of donor
5 and 6 is depicted in Extended Data Fig. 1c. The overlap of the point mutations between
ASCs of the same donor is depicted in Extended Data Fig. 4d.
Validations of point mutations

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We evaluated our mutation filtering procedure by independent validations of 374 preselected positions that were either discarded or passed during filtering using amplicon-based
next-generation sequencing. To this end, primers were designed ~250 nucleotides 5′ and 3′
from the candidate point mutations to obtain amplicons of ~500 bp (primer sequences
available upon request). These regions were PCR-amplified for both the organoid cultures
and reference samples of donor 5 and 6, using 5 ng genomic DNA, 1× PCR Gold Buffer
(Life Technologies), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold
(Life Technologies) in a final volume of 10 μl. This which was held at 94 °C for 60 s
followed by 15 cycles at 92 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s (with a decrement of 0.2 °C per
cycle) and 72 °C for 60 s; followed by 30 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C
for 60 s; with a final extension at 72 °C for 180 s. The PCR products were pooled and
barcoded per culture. Illumina sequence libraries were generated according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the libraries were pooled and sequenced using the
MiSeq platform (2 × 250 bp) to an average depth of ~100×. Alignment and variant-calling
was performed as described above. For each ASC we evaluated those positions with at least
20× coverage for both culture and reference sample, and defined positive positions as those
with a call in culture, with a VAF ≥ 0.3 and no call in the reference sample. Subsequently,
we determined the number of confirmed negatives of the positions that were filtered out for
each filter step (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Moreover, we determined the number of confirmed
positive of the positions that passed all filters (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f).
Assessment of effects of in vitro culturing on ASC mutation load
We expanded 10 initial clonal organoid cultures from small intestine and liver for a further
3–5 months (equivalent to ~20 weekly passages), upon which we isolated single cells and
subjected them to clonal expansion to obtain sufficient DNA for WGS (Extended Data Fig.
6a). This approach allowed us to catalogue the mutations that accumulated in single ASCs
during the culturing period between the two clonal steps. To this end, we selected the
somatic point mutations that were unique to the sub-clonal cultures and not present in the
corresponding original clonal cultures and therefore acquired during the in vitro expansion.
We evaluated the specificity of our mutation-discovery procedure by determining the

confirmation rate of the mutations identified in the original clone in the corresponding
subclone. Only positions that had a coverage of ≥20× in both the original clonal and
corresponding subclonal culture as well as in the reference sample were evaluated. On
average, 91.1% ± 4.87 (mean ± s.d). of these point mutations were confirmed in the
subclonal cultures (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Correlation between ASC somatic point mutation accumulation and age
The surveyed area per ASC was calculated as the number of positions coverage ≥20× in both
culture and the reference sample. The percentage of the whole non-N autosomal genome
(GCRh37: 2,682,655,440 bp) that is surveyed in each ACS is depicted in Extended Data
Table 1. For each ASC the total number of identified somatic point mutations was
extrapolated to the whole non-N autosomal genome using its surveyed area. Subsequently, a
linear mixed-effects regression model was fitted to estimate the effect of age on the number
of somatic point mutations for each tissue using the nlme R package31,32, in which ‘donor’
is modelled as a random effect to resolve the non-independence that results from having
multiple measurements per donor. A two-tailed t-test was performed to test whether the
slope is significantly different from zero (that is to say, whether the fixed age effect in the
linear mixed model is statistically significant). The intercept of the regression lines with the
y axis represents the somatic mutations present at birth (that have accumulated in the tissue
lineage during prenatal development) plus the noise levels in the data and the mutations that
have accumulated during the first week(s) of culturing proceeding the clonal step (see
above). Since all cells were assessed in a similar manner, noise levels will be comparable
and therefore will not bias the mutation rate (slope) estimates. The slope of the regression
line was used to estimate the fixed age effect on somatic point mutation rate per tissue.

To exclude the possibility that differences in surveyed areas between ASCs bias our results,
we performed the age correlation and spectrum analyses on a subset of mutations that are
located in genomic regions that are surveyed (≥20×) in all samples in this study. This
consensus surveyed area comprises 38.2% of the autosomal non-N genome and both the
mutation rate and spectra were highly similar to those in Fig. 1c (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c),
indicating that the differences in surveyed areas between the clones do not bias our
conclusions.
Definition of genomic regions
To generate a conserved DNA replication timing profile for the human genome, we
downloaded 16 Repli-seq data sets from the ENCODE project33 at the University of
California, SantaCruz (UCSC) genome browser34 (GRCh37/hg19). The data consisted of
Wavelet-smoothed values per 1-kb bin throughout the genome for 15 different cell lines (BJ,
BG02ES, GM06990, GM12801, GM12812, GM12813, GM12878, HeLa-S3, HepG2,
HUVEC, IMR90, K562, MCF-7, NHEK and SK-N-SH). We considered the median values
of all cell lines per bin, thereby excluding cell-specific values. We arbitrarily divided the
genome into early- (≥60), intermediate- (>33 & <60) and late- (≤33) replicating bins (Fig.
3b). To generate a conserved chromatin-association profile for the human genome, we
downloaded data containing the H3K9me3 signal per 25-nucleotide bin throughout the
genome for 22 different cell lines (A549, AG04450, DND41, GM12878, H1-hESC, HeLa-

NHDF-Ad, NHEK, NHLF, osteoblasts, MCF-7, NT2-D1, PBMC and U2OS) and the
H3K27ac signal for 9 different cell lines (CD20+_RO01794, DND41, H1-hESC, HeLa-S3,
HSMM, monocytes-CD14+_RO1746, NH-A, NHDF and osteoblasts). Data were
downloaded from the ENCODE project33 at the UCSC browser34 (GRCh37/hg19) and the
median values of all cell lines per bin were calculated. Next, we determined the distribution
of the fractions of all bins (genome-wide). According to the shape of the resulting graph, we
considered bins with an H3K9me3 value ≥4, or an H3K27ac value ≥2, as associated with
that chromatin mark. Finally, exonic sequences were defined as all exonic regions reported
in Ensembl v75 (GCRh37)35.
Enrichment or depletion of point mutations in genomic regions
We determined whether somatic point mutations were enriched or depleted in the genomic
regions described above. To this end, we determined how many point mutations were
observed in each genomic region for each donor. Next, we calculated the number of bases
that were surveyed in each genomic region and calculated the expected number of point
mutations by multiplying this surveyed length with the genome-wide point-mutation
frequency. The log2(observed/expected) of the mutations in the genomic regions was used as
a measure of the effect size of the depletion or enrichment. One-tailed binomial tests were
performed to calculate the statistical significance of deviations from the expected number of
mutations in the genomic regions using pbinom31; P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Mutational signatures

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The occurrences of all 96-trinucleotide changes were counted for each ASC and averaged
per donor. Three mutational signatures were extracted using NMF36. To determine the
replication bias of signatures, we determined whether the point mutations were located in an
intermediate, early or late replicating region (as defined above) using GenomicRanges37 and
repeated the NMF on a 288 count matrix (96 trinucleotides × 3 replication timing regions).
Similarly, we looked at transcriptional strand bias by performing NMF on a 192 count
matrix (96 trinucleotides × 2 strands). To this end, we selected all point mutations that fall
within gene bodies and checked whether the mutated C or T was located on the transcribed
or non-transcribed strand. We defined the transcribed units of all protein coding genes based
on Ensembl v75 (GCRh37)35 and included introns and untranslated regions.

The dN/dS ratio was determined as described previously18. In brief, we used 192 rates, one
for each of the possible trinucleotide changes in both strands. For each substitution type, we
counted the number of potential synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the proteincoding sequences of the human genome, using the longest DNA coding sequence as the
reference sequence for each gene. Poisson regression was used to obtain maximumlikelihood estimates and confidence intervals of the normalized ratio of non-synonymous
versus synonymous mutations (dN/dS ratio). The dN/dS ratio was tested against neutrality
(dN/dS = 1) using a likelihood-ratio test.

Comparison of mouse and human intestinal ASCs mutation loads

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Intestinal ASCs were isolated from the proximal part of the small intestine of randomly
chosen ~2-year-old mice (one male and one female) carrying the Lgr5-EGFP-Ires-CreERT2
allele (mice were C57BL/6 background) by sorting for GFPhigh cells. Subsequently, three
Lgr5-positive cells per animal were clonally expanded as described4. All experiments were
approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences
according to the Dutch legal ethical guidelines. DNA isolated from the intestinal ASC
cultures isolated from mouse 1 were sequenced with paired-end (75 and 35 bp) runs using
SOLiD 5500 sequencers (Life Technologies) to an average depth of ~18× base coverage.
Intestinal ASC cultures of mouse 2 were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencers
as described above. Sequence reads were aligned using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner to the
mouse reference genome (NCBIM37) and point mutations were called using the GATK
UnifiedGenotyper v2.7.2 as described above. Post-processing filters for the intestinal ASCs
of mouse 1 (analysed by SOLiD sequencing) were as follows: a minimum depth of 10×,
variant uniquely called in one intestinal stem cell without more than one alternative allele
found at the same position in the other ASCs of the same mouse, a GATK a phred-scaled
quality score ≥100, variant absent in mouse 2, variant position absent in the dbSNP (build
128) and a VAF ≥ 0.25. Post-processing filters for the intestinal ASCs of mouse 2 (analysed
by Illumina sequencing) were as described above for the human mutation data.
Cancer-associated mutation spectra analysis in driver genes
Mutations identified in the indicated genes in colorectal or liver cancers were downloaded
from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Only point mutations that resulted in a
missense, nonsense or splice-site mutation were considered.
CNV detection

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To detect copy-number variations (CNVs), BAM files were analysed for read-depth
variations by CNVnator v0.2.7 (ref. 38) with a bin size of 1 kb and Control-FREEC v6.739
with a bin size of 5 kb. Highly variable regions, defined as harbouring germline CNVs in at
least three control samples, were excluded from the analysis. To obtain somatic CNVs, we
excluded CNVs for which there was evidence in the reference sample (blood/biopsy) of the
same individual. Resulting candidate CNV regions were assessed for additional structural
variants on the paired-end and split-read level through DELLY v0.3.3 (ref. 40). Based on
these results, we excluded five candidate CNV regions as mapping artefacts on the readdepth level and acquired base-pair accuracy of the involved breakpoints for the other events.
This also revealed the tandem orientation of the duplication events and the complex
structural variation in the colon sample.
Reported gene definitions (Extended Data Table 2) are based on Ensembl v75 (GCRh37)35.
Common fragile sites overlapping the events were detected using existing definitions41.
LINE/SINE elements within 100 bp of the breakpoints were determined with the repeat
element annotation42 from the UCSC genome browser34 GCRh37 (retrieved 26 October
2015).

a, Schematic overview of the experimental setup to determine somatic mutations in
individual human ASCs. Colon, small intestine and liver biopsies were cultured in bulk for
1-2 week(s) before single cells were sorted and clonally expanded until enough DNA could
be isolated for WGS analysis. WGS of the clonal organoid culture allows for cataloguing of
somatic variants in the original ASCs that gave rise to the clonal cultures that were acquired
during life and the first 7–14 days of culturing. Biopsy or blood was sequenced as a
reference sample. b, Filter steps to obtain somatic mutations in ASCs. c, Number of point
mutations that pass each corresponding filter step in a for each ASC culture of donors 5 and

Independent validations of mutations that passed all filters by amplicon-based resequencing. Confirmed positions are defined as those with a call in the indicated ASC with a
VAF ≥ 0.3 and without a call in the corresponding reference sample. f, Qualification of
unconfirmed positions based on manual inspection. True-positive positions are positions that
were correctly called, but for which the VAF threshold was not met in the validation
experiment. False-positive positions are positions without evidence in the validation
experiment or are noisy. ‘Missed in germline’ are positions that were called in the reference
sample in the validation experiment.

Extended Data Figure 2. Variant allele frequency distribution plot for each assessed ASC.

A distribution plot of the VAFs of all somatic mutations that remain before filtering for the
VAF in filter step 6 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Clonal heterozygous somatic mutations form a
peak around VAF = 0.5. A threshold of VAF ≥ 0.3 was used to obtain somatic mutations that
were clonal in the organoid cultures and therefore present in the original cloned ASCs (see
Methods). Mutations acquired after the single ASC expansion step are subclonal (that is, not
present in all cells of the clonal culture) and have lower VAFs. Two samples (donor 14, ASC
14-b and donor 17, ASC 17-c) showed a shift in the main VAF peak to the left, indicating

Figure 1. Age-associated accumulation of somatic point mutations in human ASCs.

a, Correlation of the number of somatic point mutations in each ASC type examined
(extrapolated to the whole autosomal genome) with age of the donors per tissue. Each data
point represents a single ASC. The P values of the age effects in the linear mixed model
(two-tailed t-test) are indicated for each tissue. The sample sizes for colon, small intestine
and liver ASCs are 6, 9 and, 5 donors, with, in total, 21, 14 and 10 ASCs, respectively. b,
Somatic mutation accumulation rate per tissue as estimated by the linear mixed models in a.
Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the slope estimates. c, Relative
contribution of the indicated mutation types to the point mutation spectrum for each tissue
type. Data are represented as the mean relative contribution of each mutation type over all
ASCs per tissue type (n = 21, 14 and 10 for colon, small intestine and liver, respectively) and
error bars represent standard deviation. The total number of identified somatic point
mutations per tissue is indicated.

a, Contribution of context-dependent mutation types to the three mutational signatures that
were identified by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) analysis of the somatic mutation
collection observed in the ASCs across all assessed tissues. The contribution of each
trinucleotide (order is similar to that in ref. 11) to each signature is shown. For each
signature, the presence of transcriptional-strand bias, DNA-replication-timing bias and/or
association with the culture system is indicated. b, Absolute contribution of each mutational
signature type (extrapolated to the whole autosomal genome) plotted against the age of the
donors for each tissue. Each data point represents a single ASC. The P values of the age
effects per tissue are shown (linear mixed model, two-tailed t-test). c, Signature-specific
mutation rate per year per genome for each tissue as estimated by the linear mixed model in
b. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the slope estimates.

Figure 3. Non-random genomic distribution of somatic point mutations in ASCs.

a, Enrichment and depletion of somatic point mutations in the indicated genomic regions for
each tissue. The log2 ratio of the number of observed and expected point mutations indicates
the effect size of the enrichment or depletion in each region. *P < 0.05, one-sided binomial
test. b, Distribution of DNA replication timing for all genomic positions and the somatic
point mutations detected in human ASCs per tissue. c, Relative contribution of each pointmutation type on the transcribed and untranscribed strand for each tissue. *P < 0.05, twosided Poisson test.

ASCs.

a, Spectrum of point mutations in cancer driver genes APC, TP53, SMAD4 and CTNNB1
identified in colorectal and liver cancer. The total number of somatic point mutations per
gene per cancer type is indicated. b, Read-depth analysis indicating a relatively small
deletion (~90 kb) located within a common fragile site (FRA2I) in intestinal ASC 11-a. Each
point represents the log2 value of the GC-corrected read-depth ratio per 5-kb window.
Dashed lines indicate breakpoint regions; a schematic representation of the identified
structural variant with associated genomic and breakpoint features is depicted below. c, Two
