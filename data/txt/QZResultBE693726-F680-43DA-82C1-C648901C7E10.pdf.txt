ABSTRACT
Luminal A breast cancer usually responds to hormonal therapies but does not
benefit from chemotherapies, including microtubule-targeted paclitaxel. MicroRNAs
could play a role in mediating this differential response. In this study, we examined
the role of micro RNA 100 (miR-100) in the sensitivity of breast cancer to paclitaxel
treatment. We found that while miR-100 was downregulated in both human breast
cancer primary tumors and cell lines, the degree of downregulation was greater in
the luminal A subtype than in other subtypes. The IC50 of paclitaxel was much higher
in luminal A than in basal-like breast cancer cell lines. Ectopic miR-100 expression
in the MCF-7 luminal A cell line enhanced the effect of paclitaxel on cell cycle arrest,
multinucleation, and apoptosis, while knockdown of miR-100 in the MDA-MB-231
basal-like line compromised these effects. Similarly, overexpression of miR-100
enhanced the effects of paclitaxel on tumorigenesis in MCF-7 cells. Rapamycinmediated inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a target of miR100, also sensitized MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel. Gene set enrichment analysis showed
that genes that are part of the known paclitaxel-sensitive signature had a significant
expression correlation with miR-100 in breast cancer samples. In addition, patients
with lower levels of miR-100 expression had worse overall survival. These results
suggest that miR-100 plays a causal role in determining the sensitivity of breast
cancers to paclitaxel treatment.

INTRODUCTION

key molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of
breast cancer subtypes to specific drugs largely remain to
be clarified [2, 5]. For example, while luminal A breast
cancers generally have a good prognosis and respond well
to hormonal therapies, they do not appear to benefit from
the addition of the microtubule-targeted chemotherapy
drug paclitaxel [2, 6-8]. The underlying mechanisms for
this are still unclear, although a gene signature has been
suggested based on expression profiling of breast cancers
that respond or do not respond to paclitaxel treatment [9].
MicroRNAs are a group of small non-coding
RNAs that function as gene regulators in a variety
of biological processes [10]. For example, miR-100
regulates apoptosis, autophagy, cell growth and survival,
migration, stem cell self-renewal and drug sensitivity by

Breast cancer is a major disease for which more
effective and efficient therapies need to be developed.
Molecular expression profiling, in combination with the
expression status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) [1-3], has led to the classification of breast
cancers into four subtypes [4, 5]: luminal A (ER+, PR+
and HER2-), luminal B (ER+, PR+ and HER2+), HER2
positive (ER-, PR- and HER2+), and basal-like (ER, PR- and HER2-, or triple negative) [3]. Each subtype
has distinct biological behavior, prognosis, and usually
different responses to different chemotherapies, yet the

targeting different molecules such as mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR), PLK1 and SMARCA5 [11-13].
MiR-100 appears to play a role in cancer development.
For example, miR-100 is commonly downregulated in
various types of human tumors [14-20], and lower levels
of miR-100 expression correlate with poorer prognosis
in patients with several types of malignancies such as
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer [14-17, 21].
In breast cancer, miR-100 also appears to play a role, as
miR-100 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition but
suppresses tumorigenesis, migration and invasion [11].
The tumor suppressor function of miR-100 appears to
involve the proliferation and survival-promoting oncogene
insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 2 [22]. However, the role
of miR-100 in breast cancer remains to be clarified. For
example, while miR-100 regulates β-tubulin isotypes in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells [23], and tubulin alteration is
a known mechanism for breast cancer resistance to the
microtubule-targeted drug paclitaxel [24], luminal A breast
cancers are less responsive to paclitaxel treatment, and
the role of miR-100 in paclitaxel response is unknown.
In addition, while miR-100 inhibits the self-renewal of
breast cancer stem-like cells (BrCSCs) and sensitizes
basal-like breast cancer stem cells to hormonal therapy by
promoting cell differentiation [25, 26], whether miR-100
has different effects on different subtypes of breast cancer
remains unknown.
In this study, we evaluated the role of miR-100
in different subtypes of breast cancer, with a focus
on paclitaxel response. Considering that mTOR, an
important player in PI3K oncogenic signaling, has been
identified as a target molecule of miR-100 [13, 27], and
combined use of rapamycin and paclitaxel improves the
chemotherapeutic effect of either in breast cancer [28],
we also tested whether miR-100 affects the response
of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel by targeting mTOR.
Expression evaluation, functional and molecular tests, and
bioinformatic and survival analyses suggest that miR-100
plays a role in breast cancer development by promoting
paclitaxel sensitivity in part by targeting mTOR.

breast cancers, luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and basal-like
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, the ratio of miR-100 level in a
tumor to that in matched normal control, which indicates
the extent of miR-100 downregulation, was significantly
smaller in luminal A tumors than in other tumors (Figure
1A), indicating that miR-100 downregulation was more
extensive in the luminal A subtype of breast cancer.
Similar results were obtained when miR-100
expression, as determined by RNA-Seq, was analyzed
in the group of breast cancer samples that had matched
normal tissues with complete ER, PR and HER2 status
in the TCGA database (Table S1). Again, miR-100
was downregulated in these breast cancers, and the
downregulation was more pronounced in luminal A breast
cancers than in other subtypes of tumors (Figure 1B).

MiR-100 sensitizes breast cancer cells to paclitaxel
inhibition of cell proliferation and survival
Compared to other subtypes of breast cancer,
luminal A cancers are responsive to hormonal therapy
but more resistant to chemotherapies including paclitaxel
treatment [2, 6-8]. Considering the more severe miR100 downregulation in luminal A cancers (Figure 1), it is
possible that miR-100 is functionally involved in breast
cancer sensitivity to paclitaxel’s cytotoxic effect. To test
this possibility, we first evaluated miR-100 expression by
real-time PCR in 3 luminal A (ZR-75-1, T-47D and MCF7) and 3 basal-like (BT-549, Hs 578T and MDA-MB-231)
breast cancer cell lines [29, 30], with immortalized
noncancerous breast epithelial cell lines 184A1 and
MCF10A as references. Compared to the noncancerous
lines and 3 basal-like lines, the 3 luminal A cell lines
expressed much less miR-100 (Figure 2A), consistent with
the pattern of miR-100 expression in the two subtypes
seen in human breast cancer specimens (Figure 1).
We then determined IC50 values of paclitaxel in the
6 breast cancer cell lines. The IC50 values of paclitaxel
were much higher in the 3 luminal A lines (ranging from
2 to 10 µg/ml), all of which had lower levels of miR-100
expression, than in the 3 basal-like breast cancer cell lines
(less than 0.05 µg/ml) (Figure 2B). IC50 values between
the 2 groups of breast cancer cell lines were significantly
correlated with miR-100 expression levels (P < 0.001),
supporting the role of miR-100 in the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment.
To determine whether miR-100 plays a causal role
in paclitaxel response, we increased miR-100 expression
in MCF-7 cells to a level similar to that in basal-like
breast cancer cell lines, as determined by real-time PCR
(Figure 2C, panel at right), and then measured the effect
of paclitaxel on cell proliferation and survival using the
CCK8 assay. While restoration of miR-100 expression did
not change cell proliferation or survival (Figure 2C, bars
at far left), it significantly enhanced the effect of paclitaxel

RESULTS
MiR-100 is downregulated in human breast
cancer, particularly the luminal A subtype
To clarify the function of miR-100 in breast cancer,
we first evaluated the expression of miR-100 by real-time
PCR in 36 breast cancer specimens, with each cancer’s
adjacent normal breast tissue as the control. In addition
to confirming a significant downregulation of miR-100 in
breast cancer tissues (Figure 1A), we noticed that miR-100
downregulation occurred in each of the four subtypes of

even at the low concentration of 1 ng/ml (Figure 2C, panel
at left), with IC50 decreasing from 9.6 μg/ml (9.56 ± 1.8) to
0.05 μg/ml (0.05 ± 0.02). In addition, paclitaxel induced
miR-100 expression in two luminal A breast cancer cell
lines, MCF-7 and T-47D (Figure 2D), suggesting that
miR-100 can serve as an effector in paclitaxel-induced
cellular responses.
In the MDA-MB-231 basal-like breast cancer
cell line, which expressed a much higher miR-100
level than MCF-7 cells (Figure 1) and was much more
sensitive to paclitaxel (Figure 2B), knockdown of miR-

100 expression did not affect cell proliferation or survival
with no or lower concentrations of paclitaxel (0-0.01 µg/
ml) but significantly compromised the effect of higher
concentrations of paclitaxel (0.1-10 µg/ml) (Figure 2E).
These results indicate that miR-100 plays a causal role
in breast cancer cell sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of
paclitaxel on cell proliferation and survival.

before paclitaxel administration, miR-100 expression
appeared to reduce tumor volumes but the reduction was
not statistically significant (Figure 3A). After paclitaxel
treatment was started, tumor growth was significantly
suppressed. This suppression was much more profound
in tumors expressing ectopic miR-100, as indicated by
significantly reduced tumor volumes from day 2 after
paclitaxel administration (Figure 3A), tumor weights

paclitaxel treatment in a xenograft model.

We also performed tumorigenesis assays to
determine whether miR-100 expression improves the
therapeutic effect of paclitaxel on breast cancer. MCF7 breast cancer cells were transfected with miR-100
expression plasmid and control vector, and cells stably
expressing exogenous miR-100 or control vector were
injected subcutaneously into nude mice, with or without

translation, to regulate biological processes. We therefore
performed a series of analyses to identify the molecular
target(s) of miR-100 involved in breast cancer sensitivity
to paclitaxel treatment. Based on previous publications,
we first summarized the major cellular processes and
underlying molecules that determine breast cancer
sensitivity or resistance to paclitaxel treatment (Table S2).
We then collected all molecules that had been identified
as target molecules of miR-100 (Table S3). By comparing
molecules involved in both groups, we found that mTOR
was the only known miR-100 target that has also been
shown to affect breast cancer sensitivity to paclitaxel. To
evaluate whether mTOR is a target molecule of miR-100
in breast cancer, we collected breast cancer samples in the
TCGA database that had expression information for both
miR-100 and mTOR protein (Table S4), and looked for
correlations between their expression levels. A significant
inverse correlation was found between miR-100 and
mTOR in invasive breast cancers (Figure 5A), implicating
mTOR as a target of miR-100 in breast cancer.
To experimentally test whether mTOR plays a role
in miR-100-mediated sensitivity to paclitaxel, we first
measured mTOR protein expression in the 6 luminal A and
basal-like breast cancer cell lines used for expression and
functional analyses of miR-100. The expression of mTOR

Paclitaxel treatment induces cell cycle arrest,
multinucleation and apoptosis [31, 32]. We examined
these cellular processes in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells
with or without miR-100 overexpression to determine
their involvement in miR-100-mediated sensitization to
paclitaxel. While miR-100 overexpression did not itself
alter cell cycle progression, it significantly enhanced
the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by
paclitaxel treatment (Figure 4A and 4B). Similarly,
while miR-100 overexpression did not induce detectable
multinucleation and apoptosis, it significantly enhanced
the induction of both multinucleation and apoptosis
observed following paclitaxel treatment (Figure 4C-4F).
These findings indicate a role of miR-100 in paclitaxelinduced cell cycle arrest, multinucleation and apoptosis.

was significantly higher in the 3 luminal A cell lines than in
the basal-like lines (P < 0.01) (Figure 5B). The pattern was
the inverse of that seen for miR-100 expression (Figure
2A). Additional experiments further confirmed that mTOR
is indeed a target of miR-100 in breast cancer cells. When
miR-100 was ectopically expressed in MCF-7 cells, the
mTOR protein level was dramatically decreased (Figure
5C, panel at left). Consistently, when miR-100 expression
was inhibited in MDA-MB-231 cells, the mTOR protein
level was increased (Figure 5C, panel at right).
To functionally evaluate whether mTOR plays a
role in miR-100-mediated paclitaxel sensitization, we
treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a concentration
of paclitaxel (1 ng/ml) that was too low to affect cell
proliferation and survival. Under these conditions,
inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, also at a concentration
that was too low to suppress cell proliferation and survival,
significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel
on cell proliferation and survival (Figure 5D). This result
confirms that mTOR plays a role in miR-100-mediated
sensitization of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel.

We also performed survival analyses for the group
of breast cancer patients from the TCGA database (Table
S4). Patients with lower miR-100 expression in their
cancers had worse overall survival (Figure 6C). For
mTOR, patients with higher tumor protein levels had a
trend of worse survival but the difference did not reach
statistical significance (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION
MiR-100 causally affects paclitaxel sensitivity in
breast cancer
Luminal A breast cancers are more resistant to
chemotherapies including paclitaxel treatment [2, 6-8],
and the greater degree of downregulation of miR-100
in luminal A breast cancers (Figure 1) suggests a role
for miR-100 in determining breast cancer sensitivity to
paclitaxel treatment. Our study provides several lines
of evidence indicating that this is indeed the case. First,
when breast cancer cell lines were classified into different
subtypes based on the expression status of ER, PR and
HER2 [29, 30], luminal A lines expressed much lower
levels of miR-100 than basal-like lines (Figure 2), which
was consistent with our finding in breast cancer tissues
(Figure 1). Interestingly, the IC50 of paclitaxel was much
greater in the luminal A lines than in the basal-like lines
(Figure 2B), providing functional support for the role of
miR-100 in paclitaxel sensitivity. Second, in the MCF-7
luminal A breast cancer cell line, which expressed a lower
level of miR-100 (Figure 2A), ectopic expression of miR100 sensitized cells not only to paclitaxel-induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro (Figure 2, 4) but also
to tumor suppression in nude mice (Figure 3), providing
direct functional evidence. Consistently, in MDA-MB-231
basal-like cells, which expressed a higher level of miR100 and were very sensitive to paclitaxel (Figure 2A, 2B),
inhibition of miR-100 expression desensitized cells to
paclitaxel-induced cell proliferation and survival (Figure
2E). Third, of the published gene expression signature
that predicts a positive response of patients to paclitaxel,
the upregulated genes positively correlated, and the
downregulated genes negatively correlated, with miR-100
expression in human breast cancer (Figure 6). In addition,
paclitaxel treatment increased miR-100 expression level
in the luminal A breast cancer cell lines we tested (Figure
2D). We therefore conclude that miR-100 affects the
therapeutic response of breast cancer to paclitaxel, and
that patients with higher levels of miR-100 expression
benefit more from paclitaxel treatment.
The role of miR-100 in paclitaxel sensitivity does
not seem specific to luminal A breast cancer, because
the downregulation of miR-100 was also frequent and
significant in other subtypes of breast cancer (Figure 1),

Implication of miR-100 in the treatment of human
breast cancer with paclitaxel
To explore whether patients with breast cancers
with higher miR-100 expression levels benefit more from
paclitaxel treatment, we analyzed whether the expression
of miR-100 correlative genes is associated with the
expression of genes in the paclitaxel-sensitive signature
by using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The
paclitaxel-sensitive gene signature was established in a
previous study [9], and consists of genes that were either
upregulated or downregulated in breast cancers from
patients with a positive response to paclitaxel treatment
when compared to those from unresponsive patients. We
used the cBioPortal program and the TCGA database to
determine the expression change for every gene between
cancers and their matched normal tissues, and then
calculated the correlation of these changes to those of
miR-100 [33]. All genes were then ranked based on their
correlation scores [33]. We found that genes upregulated
in the paclitaxel-sensitive signature were significantly
enriched among genes that positively correlated with miR100 expression (Figure 6A), while genes downregulated
in the paclitaxel sensitive signature were enriched among
genes whose expression was inversely correlated with
miR-100 expression (Figure 6B). When the breast cancer
samples were divided according to their subtypes for the
GSEA, the correlation was still significant in luminal
A and B subtypes but not in the basal-like and HER2
tumor subtypes (data not shown). These results suggest
that breast cancer patients with higher tumor miR-100
expression, particularly those with luminal A and B
subtypes, benefit more from paclitaxel treatment.

and knockdown of miR-100 in MDA-MB-231 basallike breast cancer cells desensitized their response to
paclitaxel. It is unknown why and how luminal A breast
cancers have a greater degree of miR-100 downregulation
compared to other subtypes.

apoptosis [34] and autophagy [35] and in the inhibition of
cell proliferation [36] (Table S3). Our expression analysis
in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines, including
cell lines where miR-100 expression was manipulated,
further confirmed mTOR as a target of miR-100 (Figure
5A, 5B, 5C). Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin enhances
paclitaxel-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells [28], and
our results showed that even a very low concentration of
paclitaxel enhanced the effect of rapamycin on cell death
(Figure 5D). Therefore, targeting mTOR appears to be an
important mechanism by which miR-100 sensitizes breast
cancer cells to paclitaxel.

MiR-100 sensitizes breast cancer cells to paclitaxel
by targeting mTOR and other mechanisms
As a miRNA, miR-100 targets a number of genes
for translational regulation. Previous studies identified
mTOR as a direct target of miR-100 in the promotion of

Other targets of miR-100 may also contribute to
its effects on breast cancer cell sensitivity to paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel causes exit from mitosis into a G1-like
multinucleated state, and multinucleated cells undergo
apoptosis because of DNA damage [31]. Different doses
and treatment times of paclitaxel also have different effects
on these processes, as longer treatments and higher doses
induce a shift from cell cycle arrest to multinucleation and
further to apoptosis [31, 32]. Our results showed that miR100 overexpression enhanced the effect of paclitaxel on
cell cycle arrest, multinucleation and apoptosis (Figure 4).
In addition, among the large number of miR-100 targets
that have been identified in published studies (Table S3),
PLK1 kinase has also been shown in a number of studies
to function in cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is thus
possible that, like mTOR, PLK1 may also mediate the
effect of miR-100 on breast cancer sensitivity to paclitaxel,
though this remains to be determined.
In several breast cancer cell lines including the
MCF-7 luminal A line, miR-100 overexpression decreases
the number of ALDH positive cells, which represent a
stem-like subpopulation [25]. Consistently, miR-100
overexpression in MCF-7 cells inhibited mammosphere
formation (data not shown), which indicates the stemlike feature of cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-100
overexpression in basal-like cells not only inhibits the
maintenance and expansion of breast cancer stem-like
cells (BrCSCs), it also promotes their differentiation
or conversion from a basal-like phenotype to a luminal
phenotype [26]. In addition, GSEA showed that the
enrichment of genes conferring paclitaxel sensitivity in
miR-100-corresponding genes was more profound in the
luminal A and B subtypes than in basal-like and HER2
subtypes, and the former two are more differentiated than
the latter two. Therefore, while the mechanism by which
luminal A breast cancers appear to be more affected by
miR-100 is unknown, one possibility is that miR-100
plays a more crucial role in the luminal differentiation of
breast epithelial cells, and more severe downregulation of
miR-100 is important for the formation of luminal breast
cancers.

survival in breast cancer patients (Figure 6). Ectopic
expression of miR-100 sensitized, while inhibition of
miR-100 expression desensitized, breast cancer cells to
the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel both in vitro and in
xenograft tumorigenesis (Figure 2 and 3). The association
of lower miR-100 expression with worse patient survival
has also been reported in other types of cancers, including
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [14], colorectal
cancer [15], hepatocellular carcinoma [16], bladder cancer
[17], ovarian cancer [21] and non-small cell lung cancer
[20]. In addition, detection of miR-100 in the serum of
cancer patients appears to have diagnostic and prognostic
value as a potential biomarker [19, 37-40]. Our findings in
this study suggest that miR-100 may also have therapeutic
value. For example, enhancement or restoration of miR100 expression in cancer cells, particularly in luminal
A breast cancer, may sensitize these cells to paclitaxel
treatment.
In summary, we found that miR-100 expression
was significantly downregulated in breast cancer, and
the downregulation was more extensive in luminal A
breast cancers and was associated with worse patient
survival. Ectopic expression of miR-100 sensitized, while
inhibition of miR-100 expression desensitized, breast
cancer cells to the effect of paclitaxel on cell cycle arrest,
multinucleation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Expression
of genes that are part of a known signature of paclitaxel
sensitivity in breast cancer significantly correlated with
miR-100 expression. Mechanistically, targeting mTOR
appeared to mediate miR-100’s function in sensitizing
breast cancer cells to paclitaxel, but other mechanisms also
seem to be involved, including targeting other molecules
such as PLK1. These findings suggest that miR-100 plays
a role in breast cancer development, and its detection and
expression have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic
value in the detection and treatment of breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid construction

MiR-100 plays a suppressor role in breast cancer

The pcDNA3.1-miR-100 expression vector
was constructed by PCR amplification of the
genomic DNA containing pre-miR-100 with primers
5’-TCCGGAATTCGTGGAAACCAAGGGAAGC-3’
and 5’-CTAGTCTAGATTGAGGGCCAGCCTATTA-3’,
digestion with EcoRI and XbaI, and subsequent cloning
into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

Previous studies suggest that miR-100 plays a
tumor suppressor role in breast cancer, as it suppresses
the migration, invasion and tumorigenesis of breast cancer
cells, inhibits the self-renewal of BrCSCs, and promotes
the differentiation of BrCSCs[11, 22, 25, 26]. In this
study, we provided another line of evidence for a tumor
suppressor role of miR-100 in breast cancer, as we found
that miR-100 was frequently downregulated in human
breast cancer, and the extent of downregulation was
greater in the luminal A subtype of tumors than in other
subtypes (Figure 1). In addition, miR-100 downregulation
in breast cancer was associated with worse overall

Cell lines, primary tumor specimens and special
reagents
Breast cancer cell lines used in this study included
T-47D, MCF-7, ZR-75-1, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 and
5710

Oncotarget

Hs578T, all of which were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and
propagated as previously described [41]. STR analyses
have been used for cell line authentication within 6
months. MCF-7 cells with ectopic expression of miR100 were obtained by transfecting pcDNA3.1-miR-100
plasmids into cells, along with the vector control, and
selection with G418-containing medium (800 μg/ml) for
at least 2 weeks after transfection.
Breast cancer specimens and matched adjacent
noncancerous breast tissues from 36 patients were
obtained from the Department of Breast Cancer Pathology
and Research Laboratory, Cancer Hospital of Tianjin
Medical University, Tianjin, China. Samples were free of
hemorrhagic and necrotic areas, snap frozen within half an
hour after surgery in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a -80oC
freezer until use for RNA isolation.

of 10 µl CCK-8 solution per well, and the optical density
for each well was measured using an EMax Precision
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Shanghai, China)
at a 450 nm wavelength. Each treatment was performed at
least in triplicate.

RT-PCR and real-time PCR

Apoptosis assay

Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen), and the cDNA for miRNA
was synthesized with the stem-loop primer 5’ GTCGTATCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACC
ACAAG - 3’) using the RT kit from Promega
(Fitchburg, WI). Real-time PCR with SYBR green
(Takara, Dalian, China) was performed with the
Realplex Real-time PCR Detection System (Eppendorf,
Beijing, China) to detect the expression of miR-100,
with the 5’-GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT-3’ (forward)
and
5’-CCCGTAGATCCGAACTTG-3’
(reverse)
primer sequences. U6 was used as an internal
control with 5’-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3’ and
5’-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3’ PCR primers.

Apoptosis was measured by staining the cells with
Annexin V-FITC and PI. After incubation with paclitaxel
for 48 hours, cells were collected, washed with cold PBS,
resuspended in 100 µl of 1 x Annexin V binding buffer,
stained with Annexin V and PI (BD Pharmingen) by
adding 5 µl of each to each tube and incubating for 15
min at room temperature in the dark, followed by flow
cytometry analysis. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 7.6
software.

Cell cycle analysis
MCF7 cells with or without miR-100 overexpression
were exposed to paclitaxel for 48 hours as described
above, and then collected and fixed with 70% ethanol for
at least 24 hours. After washing, cells were resuspended
in PBS, incubated with propidium iodide (10 mg/ml,
Sigma) and RNase A (20 mg/ml) for 30 min in the dark,
and subjected to flow cytometry analysis with a BD
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Multinucleation analysis
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton
X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 2% BSA for 2 hours at
room temperature, and stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1000) for 15 min. Fluorescence
images were taken at room temperature with a Leica
DM4000B microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with
a DFC490 charge coupled device camera.

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described in
our previous publication [42]. Rabbit polyclonal mTOR
antibody was from Cell Signaling (catalogue #2972,
Beverly, MA) and was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Mouse
β-actin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma (Beijing,
China) and was used at 1:2000 dilution. Intensities of
protein bands were measured using NIH ImageJ software
[43, 44].

Tumorigenesis assay in nude mice
MCF-7 cells with and without miR-100 expression
were resuspended in a solution of Matrigel (BD USA) and
PBS (equal volume), and then inoculated subcutaneously
into the flanks of 8 week old female BALB/c nude mice
(Charles River, San Diego, CA) at 3 × 106 cells per
site. Pellets of 17β-estradiol (0.72 mg, 60-day release;
Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were
implanted subcutaneously in the shoulder region of each
mouse one day before cell inoculation. Three weeks after
cell inoculation, mice were given daily intraperitoneal
injections of paclitaxel (20 mg/kg b.w) or the solvent
DMSO for 5 consecutive days according to a previously

Cytotoxicity assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5000 cells
per well, allowed to adhere overnight, and incubated in
medium containing paclitaxel at various concentrations for
48 hours. Total cell numbers were determined using the
Cell Counting Kit-8 (DojinDo, Beijing, China). Briefly,
cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37℃ after the addition

described procedure [45]. Tumor volumes were measured
every other day before paclitaxel administration and daily
after the initiation of paclitaxel treatment. At the end of the
tumorigenesis assay, tumors were surgically isolated from
mice and their weights measured.

All experimental readings were expressed as mean
± standard errors. Differences between two groups were
determined by using the unpaired Student t-test, and
p-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant. In addition, the Spearman correlation analysis
was applied to the mean of miR-100 expression levels and
that of paclitaxel IC50 in luminal A and basal-like breast
cancer cell lines to determine the correlation between
miR-100 expression, IC50 and subtypes of breast cancer.

Bioinformatic analyses
Publically available databases were used for
bioinformatic analyses. MiR-100 expression in breast
cancer tissues and their adjacent normal tissues, as
determined by the Illumina HiSeq and Illumina Genome
Analyzer and indicated by normalized read counts, were
retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov) using the Synapse platform
(http://synapse.org) (syn1461151) [11]. Surrogate subtypes
of breast cancer in the TCGA database, as defined by the
IHC status of ER, PR and HER2 in patient pathological
reports, were retrieved from the Cancer Digital Slide
Archive [46]. The cBioPortal program [33] was applied to
the TCGA database to identify invasive breast carcinomas
that had information on the expression levels of both
miR-100 and mTOR protein. The latter was based on the
reverse phase protein array (RPPA) .
To identify genes whose expression changes
corresponded to that of miR-100 in breast cancer, we
used the cBioPortal program to rank the expression
change of each gene between a cancer and its normal
control compared with miR-100’s expression change
in the same tumor and normal samples. For paclitaxelresponsive genes, we used a published microarray dataset
[9], in which paclitaxel-responsive genes were identified
by comparing pre-treatment breast cancer biopsies from
patients who had a pathologic complete response (pCR)
to paclitaxel treatment to those from patients who had
no pCR (NR). Some paclitaxel-responsive genes were
upregulated while some were downregulated in biopsies
of patients with pCR to paclitaxel treatment.
As previously described [47], we used the Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software to calculate
enrichment scores for paclitaxel-responsive genes and
their expression correlation with miR-100 expression.
GSEA calculates the enrichment score by walking down
the ranked list of genes, increasing a running-sum statistic
when a gene is in the gene set and decreasing the runningsum when a gene is not in the set. The magnitude of the
increment depends on the correlation of the gene with
a phenotype (paclitaxel response). ES is the maximum
deviation from zero encountered in walking the list,
reflecting the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented
at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes (e.g., miR100-responsive genes). A positive ES indicates gene set
enrichment at the top of the ranked list, and a negative ES
indicates gene set enrichment at the bottom of the ranked
list.
