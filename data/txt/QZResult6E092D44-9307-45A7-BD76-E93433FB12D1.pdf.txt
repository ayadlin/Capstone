Factors Influencing Changes in
Employment Among Women With
Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer*
Michael J. Hassett, MD, MPH1; A. James O’Malley, PhD2; and Nancy L. Keating, MD, MPH2,3

BACKGROUND: Although studies have demonstrated that women are less likely to work after they are
diagnosed with breast cancer, the influence of cancer treatments on employment is less clear. The authors
of this report assessed whether chemotherapy or radiation therapy was associated with a disruption in
employment during the year after a breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Using a database of health insurance claims that covered 5.6 million US residents, 3233 women aged 63 years were identified who were
working full time or part time when they were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1998 and 2002. All
changes in employment during the year after a breast cancer diagnosis were identified. Using a Cox proportional hazards model that incorporated time-varying treatment variables, the authors evaluated the
impact of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on the likelihood of experiencing an employment disruption.
RESULTS: Although most women (93%) continued to work, chemotherapy recipients were more likely than
nonrecipients to go on long-term disability, stop working, or retire (hazards ratio, 1.8; P < .01). Women aged
54 years were more likely to experience a change in employment than women aged 44 years (P < .01).
Radiation therapy did not influence employment (P ¼.22). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of employed,
insured women, chemotherapy had a negative impact on employment. This finding may aid treatment decision making and could foster the development of interventions that support a patient’s ability to continue
working after treatment. It also reinforces the need to assess the impact of treatments, especially new

KEY WORDS: breast cancer, employment, disability, outcomes, risk factors.

A substantial proportion of adult cancer survivors40% to 54%reduce their work hours or stop working altogether after their cancer diagnosis.1-3 Working women with breast cancer are no exception.4-7
Older women; African-American women; and those who have physically demanding jobs, less accommodating employers, more advanced cancer, and more comorbidities are especially likely to experience a disruption of employment.5,6,8-12 Although temporary changes in employment may be needed to complete
therapy and could be welcomed by patients, permanent changes could lead to the loss of income, workrelated benefits, social connections, and satisfaction and may precipitate anxiety or depression.

The resulting financial strain and psychologic distress
could have a substantial detrimental impact on quality of
life.2,13-16
Many of the 200,000 women who are diagnosed
with breast cancer each year in the US are employed.4,6,17
Unfortunately, relatively little is known regarding the
influence of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on a
woman’s desire and ability to work. Clinical trials usually
do not report the effects of treatment on employment.
Although 2 retrospective surveys of employed women
with newly diagnosed breast cancer indicated that chemotherapy did not result in a reduction in employment,8,18 1
prospective cohort study indicated that receipt of chemotherapy was associated with more lost wages and longer
absence from work.19
Whether or not chemotherapy and radiation therapy lead to permanent changes in employment status
remains unclear. These treatments are being given increasingly frequently for ever smaller absolute benefits, and
newer more intensive treatment regimens could be more
likely to affect employment than traditional regimens.
Therefore, understanding the impact these treatments
have on employment could help patients make informed
treatment decisions. In the current study, our objective
was to determine whether chemotherapy or radiation
therapy was associated with a major disruption in employment during the year after a breast cancer diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Medstat MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters Research Database served as the data source
for this analysis. Medstat is a medical information company that compiles data from health plans that provide insurance to large companies, state and local governments,
and public organizations in the US. The MarketScan
database includes claims and enrollment records for >5.6
million individuals receiving employer-sponsored health
insurance. Similar to a previous analysis,20 we used data
from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2002 to
identify women ages 18 years to 63 years with at least 2
breast cancer diagnosis codes (174.x from the International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition [ICD-9]).
The codes had to be dated at least 30 days apart, at least 1
code had to be from a face-to-face encounter with a
healthcare provider, and women had to be enrolled con2776

tinuously for at least 3 months before through 12 months
after their first breast cancer diagnosis. Patients with other
cancer diagnoses were excluded. On the basis of a previously developed algorithm for identifying incident breast
cancer using administrative data,21 women had to have at
least 1 code for a breast cancer biopsy/surgery.
Employment status was recorded on a monthly basis
for up to 12 months after the first breast cancer diagnosis.
We categorized employment status using definitions created by Medstat, which characterized employment status
monthly based on data provided by the employer-sponsored health plans. The 8 Medstat categories were full
time, part time, early retiree, retiree, long-term disability,
Comprehensive Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
insurance, or unknown. Women whose employment data
were unavailable and those who were not working full
time or part time at the time of their first diagnosis of
breast cancer were excluded from the analysis. For women
who were working full time, we recorded a change in
employment for those whose work status changed to part
time, early retiree, retiree, long-term disability, COBRA,
or unknown. For women who were working part time, we
recorded a change in employment for those whose work
status changed to early retiree, retiree, long-term disability, COBRA, or unknown. We assumed that each of these
employment changes reflected a decrease in hours worked
or a discontinuation of employment. This included
women whose employment status changed to COBRA or
unknown, because we knew that these women were no
longer working in their old jobs and we believed they were
unlikely to start new jobs while receiving cancer therapy.
Patients were censored after their first employment status
change. We did not assess return to work, because the
dataset did not capture employment at other employers
and did not allow the linkage of records between employers. We focused our analysis only on the year after the
breast cancer diagnosis, because the majority of treatments
occur or start within this time frame.
We extracted data on age (categorized into quintiles
defined as ages 44 years, 45-49 years, 50-53 years, 5457 years, or 58-63 years), health plan type (basic comprehensive, health maintenance organization, point of service, preferred provider organization, or point of service
with capitation), and region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, West, or unknown) for each woman at her
first diagnosis of breast cancer. Noncancer comorbidity

was categorized using the Klabunde modification of the
Charlson score.22-24 A comorbid condition was considered present if 2 claims for that condition were made at
least 30 days apart from 3 months before to 12 months after the first breast cancer.20 Metastatic status was identified using ICD-9 codes for secondary malignant
neoplasms (codes 197-199); because this analysis was
based on insurance claims, more detailed stage data were
not available. Variables were categorized as listed in
Table 1. Medical claims during the 12 months after a
breast cancer diagnosis were used to identify chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hospitalization for serious
chemotherapy-related adverse events; the specific claims
that were used included Current Procedural Terminology
codes, ICD-9 codes, Diagnosis Related Group codes, and
J&Q codes, as described previously.20 Chemotherapy
medications included all major cytotoxic agents that were
used to treat breast cancer. Because anthracyclines have
been associated with additional adverse effects,25 the
receipt of an anthracycline was coded separately.
We calculated the incident rate of change in employment, expressed as the number of employment changes
per 1000 patient-years, and used Student t tests and analyses of variance to compare this rate by patient characteristics and receipt of treatments. Claims for chemotherapy
and radiation therapy were used to derive on-treatment
intervals for these therapies. The 30-day period after a
treatment was considered ‘‘time on treatment,’’ and all
other periods were considered ‘‘time off treatment.’’
When a patient received a second treatment within the
30-day window, which typically is the case (for example,
most chemotherapy regimens consist of 4 to 8 treatments
given every 2 to 3 weeks), the on-treatment period was
considered continuous until 30 days after the last treatment. An employment change was attributed to a therapy
only if it occurred during an on-treatment period for that
therapy.
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess
the effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on the
likelihood of experiencing a change in employment while
on treatment. Time-varying treatment variables for chemotherapy and radiation therapy were included in the
model, so women could contribute information to the
treatment groups when they were receiving therapy and to
the control group when they were not receiving therapy.
The model also included the covariates described above.

To explore whether other factors might help explain the
association between chemotherapy and change in employment, we modified the base model in several ways. First,
we added a time-varying covariate for women who experienced hospitalizations for serious chemotherapy-related
2777

Original Article

adverse events to test whether these events explained any
part of the association between chemotherapy and change
in employment. Second, we added a variable reflecting
the receipt of anthracycline chemotherapy to assess
whether these agents were responsible for any part of the
association between chemotherapy and employment
change. Third, to test whether proportional hazards was a
reasonable assumption, we added time-by-predictor interaction variables (eg, time*age, time*chemotherapy, time*
radiation, time*metastatic status). The interaction terms
tested whether the effects of the predictors changed after a
certain time had elapsed; such effects are referred to commonly as change points. Because no significant interaction
effects were identified, we concluded that the proportional hazards assumption was reasonable.
In sensitivity analyses, we restricted the cohort to
the 70% of employment changes to early retiree, retiree,
and long-term disability status (ie, excluding changes to
COBRA and unknown); the results were similar and are
not presented. We also repeated analyses restricting the
cohort to women who were working full time at diagnosis (99% of women); again, the results were similar and
are not presented. Finally, to explore whether the relation between chemotherapy and employment varied for
younger women versus older women, we repeated analyses after stratifying at the median age (51 years). Model
results are presented as hazards ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs). Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were 2-sided,
and P values <.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Of the 5.6 million insured lives in the MedStat dataset
from January 1998 to December 2002, there were 4068
women aged <64 years who had newly diagnosed breast
cancer and at least 1 year of follow-up data. Seventy-nine
percent of these women (3233) were working full time or
part time when they first were diagnosed with breast cancer; these women comprised the main cohort that we
analyzed in the current study. The majority of the
835 patients who were not included in the final cohort
were early retirees at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis. They tended to be older (mean age, 58.3 years vs
50.6 years; difference, 7.7 years [95% CI, 7.2-8.2 years])
2778

and were less likely to receive chemotherapy (40.5% vs
53.8%; P < .001).
The baseline characteristics of the 3233 women who
were working full time or part time are listed in Table 1.
Most women had nonmetastatic disease and no comorbidities (Table 1). Approximately 54% received chemotherapy, 58% received radiation therapy, and 6.6%
experienced a change in employment. The most common
employment change was from full time to early retiree
(67%), followed by full time to unknown (12%), full
time to COBRA (9%), full time to retiree (6%), and full
time to long-term disability (5%). Only 2% of all changes
in employment were from part time to another status.
Not controlling for other predictors, women who were
older and those who had metastatic cancer or a comorbidity score 1 demonstrated a higher rate of employment
change than others (Table 2). Chemotherapy recipients
also demonstrated a higher rate of employment change
than nonrecipients, but this unadjusted difference was not
statistically significant.
Controlling for other observed patient characteristics and using time-varying treatment variables to examine the effects of treatments on employment, women
who were receiving chemotherapy had 1.8-fold greater
risk of experiencing a change in employment versus
women who were not receiving chemotherapy, and older
women were more likely to experience a change in
employment than younger women (Table 3). Radiation
therapy, having more comorbid conditions, and having
metastatic cancer were not found to be associated with
employment change. In additional models, receiving
anthracycline chemotherapy and being hospitalized for a
chemotherapy-related adverse effect also were not associated with employment change. None of the interaction
terms that were added to the base model (including chemotherapy*age, radiation therapy*age, chemotherapy*
metastatic status, and age*metastatic status) were statistically significant. When we repeated the model stratified
by age, a significant association between chemotherapy
use and employment change was observed among
women aged >51 years (HR, 1.9; 95%CI, 1.2-3), but
not among women aged 51 years (HR, 1.5; 95%CI,
0.5-3.9). There was less power to detect an association in
the younger women, because the relative difference
between the event rates in the chemotherapy and nonchemotherapy subgroups was smaller.

DISCUSSION
We observed that chemotherapy recipients were more
likely to go on long-term disability, stop working, or retire
compared with women who were not receiving chemotherapy even after controlling for other patient characterCancer

istics and treatment variables. Although our analysis could
not characterize the exact mechanism by which chemotherapy affects employment, we suspect that chemotherapy-related adverse events decrease patients’ desire or
2779

Original Article

ability to work or both. It is noteworthy that hospitalizations for acute chemotherapy-related adverse events did
not appear to mediate this correlation. This finding suggests that chronic chemotherapy-related adverse events are
more likely to influence employment than short-term
chemotherapy-related side effects, even when those shortterm side effects are serious enough to cause hospitalization. We also observed that the association between chemotherapy and employment was greater for older women
than for younger women, although the relation for
younger women was estimated imprecisely because of the
small number of employment changes in that group. No
other patient characteristics were associated with a greater
risk of experiencing a change in employment, nor was
receipt of radiation therapy.
Quality-of-life studies identify chemotherapy as the
breast cancer treatment that causes the most long-term
physical and emotional morbidity.26-30 Many women with
breast cancer who stop working within 6 months of their
diagnoses do so because of treatment-related symptoms.6
However, 2 previous studies (a survey of 145 breast cancer
patients who were diagnosed between 1986 and 1991 and a
study of 416 breast cancer patients who were diagnosed during 2001 and 2002) reported no association between the
receipt of chemotherapy and employment.8,18 Several factors could explain why we observed an association when
these other studies did not. First, our analysis may have had
greater power to detect a relation, because the sample size
was larger. Moreover, the multivariate model accounted for
predictor variables that could have masked the effect of
chemotherapy and incorporated time-varying covariates
that may have helped isolate the component of variation attributable to chemotherapy. Second, we obtained information on cancer treatments and employment directly from
patients’ insurance companies rather than patient surveys,
which may be subject to response and recall bias. Finally,
patients with more advanced cancer and those who have
more difficulty with chemotherapy may have been less likely
to complete surveys but more likely to experience employment changes. Our results build on and reinforce the findings of a recently reported, contemporaneous study
indicating that chemotherapy recipients had, on average, 19
additional weeks of absence from work and 8% less compensation during their absence.19
In our large, population-based cohort, 93% of
women who were working when they were diagnosed
2780

with breast cancer still were working 12 months later.
This is higher than several previous estimates of employment among women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
One study compared 646 breast cancer survivors with 890
controls and observed that 79% of the cancer survivors
and 85% of the controls were working 3 years later.4 A
second study, a longitudinal analysis of working women
with newly diagnosed breast cancer identified from the
Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System,
observed that 82% were employed 12 months after their
diagnosis.6,8 Our cohort may have been less likely to experience an employment change than the general population
of working women with breast cancer for several reasons.
First, we required continuous enrollment in a health plan
for 12 months. Women who disenrolled before 12 months
may have experienced an employment change but were
not included in our analysis. However, women who left
the workforce but maintained their health insurance benefits through COBRA were included in the analysis. Second, our analysis only included women who worked for
employers who were sponsoring the health plans. Women
who were classified as spouses or dependants may have
been more likely to stop working but were excluded from
the analysis, because the Medstat file did not contain their
employment information. Because all of the women in
our study risked losing their benefits if they stopped working, they had an incentive to keep working. Finally, everyone in our cohort worked for a large employer. Compared
with small employers or women who are self-employed,
large employers may be more able to accommodate
employees and, in some cases, are required to do so by
law.8,31,32
Our analysis has several limitations. First, although
employment status was defined in a nontraditional way,
the categories we used (full time, part time, early retiree,
retiree, COBRA, and long-term disability) came directly
from employer-sponsored health plans as coded by Medstat and reflected major changes in employment. Moreover, our findings were robust to different definitions of
employment change. In other words, restricting the analysis to women who were employed full time when they
were diagnosed with breast cancer or to women whose
employment status changed only to retiree, early retiree,
or long-term disability (ie, excluding COBRA and
unknown) yielded similar results. We were not able to
control for return to work at other employers or to assess
Cancer

June 15, 2009

Employment and Breast Cancer/Hassett et al

employment changes that occurred more than 1 year after
a breast cancer diagnosis. However, at least 1 study
suggests that few employment changes occur more than
1 year after a breast cancer diagnosis.7
Second, information concerning several potentially
important covariates was not available from the Medstat
file. Some of these variables, such as tumor grade and receptor status, are unlikely to have a direct impact on the
relation between chemotherapy use and employment
change. They may indirectly affect employment through
their influence on treatment decisions. However, treatments were included in the model, and therefore we believe
that excluding grade and receptor status did not limit the
validity of our findings. Other variables, such as socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, occupational characteristics,
marital status, spousal employment, other family members’
insurance coverage, second jobs, or return to work, cannot
be excluded as potential confounding or mediating variables. Future analyses that include these variables would
help to assess their impact on employment change.
Third, we could control for stage only to a limited
degree, because detailed stage data were not available. Any
impact that stage could have on employment probably would
be mediated either through treatment-related adverse effects
caused by more aggressive treatment or cancer-related symptoms. Our current analysis controlled for treatments and metastatic status (patients with metastatic disease have the
greatest chance of experiencing cancer-related symptoms).
Although we did not observe an association between
advanced stage (ie, metastatic disease) and change in employment, previous studies have reported such an association.2,3,8
Our study may have lacked sufficient power to identify an
association, because only a small fraction of the patients had
metastatic disease. Although it is possible that unmeasured
variations in stage could explain the relation that we observed
between chemotherapy and employment status, this seems
unlikely, because changes in employment status were attributed to chemotherapy only if they occurred within 30 days of
receiving chemotherapy. Because disease severity could shape
the decisions made by patients and providers, its influence on
employment should be studied further.
For many patients with breast cancer, the trend is to
offer more aggressive therapies that lead to more frequent
and more serious consequences (eg, taxanes and trastuzumab for the adjuvant treatment of women with lymph
node-positive and HER-2–positive breast cancer, respecCancer

tively). Clinical trials provide few details regarding
patients’ ability to continue workinga practical consequence of therapy that may be of particular interest to
patients. Future clinical trials should assess the impact of
treatment on patient-centered outcomes such as employment. In addition, research studies should strive to gain a
better understanding of the reasons for the association
between chemotherapy and employment (ie, do changes
in employment result directly from toxicities, or do they
reflect a priori choices made by patients receiving chemotherapy), which chemotherapy-related toxicities have the
greatest impact on employment, and which factors prevent women who want to return to work from doing so.
Although knowing that chemotherapy might affect
employment is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the
decisions made by many women with breast cancer, this information could prove particularly valuable for women in
whom chemotherapy offers relatively modest benefits and
employment change confers significant detrimental consequences. For example, although it is doubtful that an association between chemotherapy and employment would have
an impact on the decision making of a woman aged 46 years
with stage III, HER-2–positive breast cancer who works
part time and is enrolled in a health plan through her husband’s employer, this information could influence the decision making of a woman aged 62 years with stage II,
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who is employed
full time and could lose her health insurance if she stops
working. Regardless, knowledge of a link between the
receipt of chemotherapy and experiencing a change in
employment could lead to stronger efforts, by employers
and others, to support women while they are being treated
for cancer and to provide rehabilitative services that help
women return to work if that is what they desire.
