ABSTRACT
While the predominant elderly and the pediatric glioblastomas have been
extensively investigated, young adult glioblastomas were understudied. In this study,
we sought to stratify young adult glioblastomas by BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations
and examine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers. In 107 glioblastomas aged from
17 to 35 years, mutually exclusive BRAF-V600E (15%), H3F3A-K27M (15.9%), H3F3AG34R/V (2.8%) and IDH1-R132H (16.8%) mutations were identiﬁed in over half of the
cases. EGFR ampliﬁcation and TERTp mutation were only detected in 3.7% and 8.4%
in young adult glioblastomas, respectively. BRAF-V600E identiﬁed a clinically favorable
subset of glioblastomas with younger age, frequent CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and
was more amendable to surgical resection. H3F3A-K27M mutated glioblastomas were
tightly associated with midline locations and showed dismal prognosis. IDH1-R132H was
associated with older age and favorable outcome. Interestingly, tumors with positive
PDGFRA immunohistochemical expression exhibited poorer prognosis and identiﬁed
an aggressive subset of tumors among K27M mutated glioblastomas. Combining BRAF,
H3F3A and IDH1 mutations allowed stratiﬁcation of young adult glioblastomas into
four prognostic subgroups. In summary, our study demonstrates the clinical values of
stratifying young adult glioblastomas with BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations, which has
important implications in reﬁning prognostic classiﬁcation of glioblastomas.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma is the commonest and most devastating primary brain cancer [1]. The disease has a universally
fatal prognosis despite aggressive treatment in which
over 85% of patients die within two years [2]. While
the median age group is middle age to elderly, a smaller
numbers of cases are found in young adults and children
[2, 3]. The predominant group of middle aged and elderly
glioblastomas has been extensively investigated. Molecular

identiﬁed a subset of adult glioblastoma with gliomaCpG island methylation phenotype (G-CIMP) which was
enriched in proneural subgroup, tightly associated with
IDH1 mutation and exhibiting favorable prognosis [5].
For the younger group, only the children’s glioblastomas
has been extensively studied [6–9]. Distinct genomic
aberrations including PDGFRA alterations and hotspot
mutations in histone 3.3 (H3F3A) at codons 27 (K27) and
34 (G34) as well as histone 3.1 (HIST1H3B) at codon 27
(K27) were frequently found in glioblastomas in children
[6–8]. Genomic study in combined series of pediatric
and adult glioblastomas further identiﬁed age-speciﬁc
biological subgroups which can be deﬁned by driver
events including H3F3A-K27M, H3F3A-G34R/V and
IDH1 mutations, strongly indicating that glioblastomas
are different diseases in different age groups [10, 11].
Recent study also reported the activating mutation BRAFV600E identiﬁed a distinct clinical subgroup of pediatric
high grade gliomas [12]. While current literature has
been only focused in glioblastomas of either children
or older patients and in particular, vast majority of adult
glioblastomas studied were above 35 years as a result
of the skewed distribution towards older age (median
age 64 years) [2], the young adult age group was known
to have better prognosis [3, 13] but was understudied
in the literature. In this regards, we investigate a set of
subgroup-deﬁning molecular biomarkers in young adult
glioblastomas aged from 17 to 35 years and evaluate the
prognostic impact of the biomarkers. Our study reveals
that BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 mutations are associated
with distinct clinical features and can stratify young adult
glioblastomas into prognostic subgroups, which have
important clinical implications in reﬁning the prognostic
classiﬁcation of glioblastomas in young adults.

(81.3%) and 80 patients (74.8%), respectively. Fifty-eight
of 87 patients (67%) received total resection. Sixty-one
of 80 patients (76.3%) received radiotherapy and 64 of
80 patients (80%) received chemotherapy, with 52 of 80
patients (65%) received concomitant chemo-radiotherapy.
Survival data was available in 94 patients (87.9%). The
median overall survival and median follow-up were 14.7
months and 31.6 months, respectively.

Young adult glioblastomas show recurrent BRAF,
H3F3A and IDH1 mutations but infrequent
TERTp mutation and EGFR ampliﬁcation
Mutational status of BRAF, H3F3A, HIST1H3B and
IDH1 were examined in all 107 young adult glioblastomas.
Over half of the cases exhibited mutations in BRAF, IDH or
H3F3A. Mutation rates of BRAF, H3F3A and IDH1 across
the cohort were 15% (16/107), 18.7% (20/107) and 16.8%
(18/107), respectively. None of the tumors showed mutation
in HIST1H3B. Among the H3F3A mutated tumors, 17
cases harbored K27M mutation, two cases harbored G34R
mutation and one case harbored G34V mutation. All IDH1
mutated tumors showed IDH1-R132H mutation and all
BRAF mutated tumors showed BRAF-V600E mutation.
TERTp mutation was only identiﬁed in 8.7% (9/104) of
young adult glioblastomas, including six cases of C228T
mutation and three cases of C250T mutation. EGFR
ampliﬁcation was detectable in only 3.7% (4/107) of young
adult glioblastomas (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure
S1). Notably, with the exception of three BRAF mutated
glioblastomas concurrently harboring TERTp mutation,
BRAF, H3F3A, IDH1, TERTp mutations and EGFR
ampliﬁcation were mutually exclusive (Figure 1).

Cohort characteristics

BRAF mutated glioblastomas show frequent
CDKN2A homozygous deletion and younger
patient age

Clinical and molecular data of the cohort was
summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. The age of the young
adult glioblastoma cohort ranged from 17 years to 35 years.
The mean and median ages were 25 years, respectively.
The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.61. Eighty-eight tumors
(82.2%) were located in cerebral hemisphere. There were
51 tumors (47.7%) involving frontal lobe, 18 tumors
(16.8%) involving parietal lobe, 30 tumors (28%) involving
temporal lobe and seven tumors (6.5%) involving occipital
lobe, with 18 cases (16.8%) affected two cerebral lobes
and ﬁve frontal tumors also affected corpus callosum (four
cases) and lateral ventricle (one case). Twenty-four tumors
(22.4%) affected midline structures including one case
(0.9%) in basal ganglia, seven cases (6.5%) in thalamus,
six cases (5.6%) in ventricular system, ﬁve cases (4.7%) in
corpus callosum, one case (0.9%) in cerebellum and four
cases (3.7%) in spinal cord. Treatment data in operation
and chemo-radiotherapy was available in 87 patients

CDKN2A homozygous deletion was detected in
35.6% (31/87) of cases with analyzable data (Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure S1). Data was non-analyzable in 20
cases due to either weak hybridization signals or strong
background ﬂuorescence. Correlating with other molecular
biomarkers examined, CDKN2A homozygous deletion was
associated with BRAF mutation. Eighty percent (12/15)
of BRAF mutated glioblastomas concurrently harbored
CDKN2A homozygous deletion, compared with 26.4%
(19/72) of BRAF wild-type glioblastomas ( p = 0.0002)
(Figure 2a). Comparing the age between BRAF mutated
and BRAF wild-type glioblastomas, patients with mutated
BRAF were younger than those with wild-type. The mean
ages of BRAF mutated glioblastomas and BRAF wild-type
glioblastomas were 22.3 years and 25.5 years, respectively
(p = 0.013) (Figure 2b). Further comparison of patient age
between the mutually exclusive molecular subgroups also
revealed that BRAF mutated glioblastomas were younger

to IDH1 wild-type tumors, with median overall survival
of 24.2 months in the mutant group and 13.5 months in
the wild-type group (p = 0.034). H3F3A-K27M mutation
was associated with poor prognosis across the cohort.
The median overall survival was 6 months in K27M
mutated tumors, compared to 17.6 months in the wild-type
counterparts (p < 0.0001). Tumors with positive PDGFRA
expression showed shorter survival (8.6 months) than
those with negative expression (17.4 months) (p = 0.03).

stratiﬁed young adult glioblastomas into four prognostic
groups across the cohort (p < 0.00001). BRAF mutated
tumors (p = 0.038) and IDH1 mutated tumors (p = 0.028)
had better prognosis than BRAF/IDH1/K27 wild-type
tumors, which in turn showed better survival than K27M

biomarkers evaluated, BRAF, H3F3A-K27M, IDH1

DISCUSSION

Figure S2). The potential prognostic value of BRAF-V600E
mutation was also recently reported in pediatric high-grade
gliomas [9, 12]. Mistry and colleagues described a series
of pediatric secondary high-grade gliomas harboring
BRAF mutation and CDKN2A deletion, showing longer
latency to transformation from low-grade lesion and better
clinical outcome [12]. By conducting genome-wide DNA
methylation proﬁling in 202 pediatric glioblastomas,
Korshunov and colleagues identiﬁed an epigenomic
subset of glioblastoma showing methylation pattern
similar to pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, enriched for
BRAF mutation and CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and
showed favorable prognosis [9]. Although those studies
were on pediatric glioblastomas, our study provided
complementary results to theirs and supported the clinical
signiﬁcance of BRAF-V600E testing in glioblastoma of
young person [9, 12, 17, 19]. Apart from the potential
prognostic value, BRAF-V600E mutation also served as
a novel therapeutic target in this subset of glioblastomas.
Robinson and colleagues recently reported a case of
BRAF mutated pediatric glioblastoma treated by BRAF
inhibitor vemurafenib and showed complete response [20].
Given the potential clinical utility in prognostication and
treatment selection, BRAF mutational testing, either by
direct sequencing or immunohistochemistry [21], should
be conducted in glioblastomas of young patients.
Histone H3 mutation was exclusively observed in
H3F3A in 18.7% of young adult glioblastomas. HIST1H3B
mutation was not found in any of the 107 young adult
samples examined, suggesting the mutation was speciﬁc
to diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) but not for
non-brainstem high grade gliomas in both pediatric and
adult patients [7, 22]. K27M and G34R/V mutated tumors
showed distinct tumor locations and clinical outcome
in our cohort as in pediatric glioblastomas [9, 10]. In
our cohort, vast majority of K27M mutated tumors
were located in midline structures including thalamus,
ventricular system and cervical / thoracic spinal cord.
These rare midline glioblastomas, despite of their different
anatomical locations, shared the same driver mutation and
suggested a closely-related origin [10, 23]. Notably, K27M
mutated glioblastomas showed aggressive clinical course
in our cohort with median overall survival of 6 months
(range 0.1 months to 19.8 months). Within this aggressive
subset of glioblastoma, tumors with positive PDGFRA
immunohistochemical expression exhibited a signiﬁcantly
shorter survival (median 2.5 months) than tumors with
negative expression (median 11.7 months) (p = 0.03).
Interestingly, Puget and colleagues previously reported a
distinct transcriptional subgroup of DIPG characterized
by oligodendroglial differentiation, driven by PDGFRA
upregulation and exhibited signiﬁcantly worse outcome
[23]. The association of PDGFRA expression with poor
prognosis in K27M mutated glioblastomas in our study
was in line with previous observation. The prognostic
value of PDGFRA expression / alterations in the K27M

While the predominant middle-aged and elderly
glioblastomas as well as the pediatric glioblastomas have
been extensively investigated, there is lack of focusing
study in the young adult age group. In this study, we
showed that prognostication and possibly classiﬁcation
of young adult glioblastoma can be biomarker-based and
demonstrated that a signiﬁcant portion of young adult
glioblastomas could be genetically deﬁned by mutually
exclusive BRAF-V600E mutation (15%), H3F3A-K27M
mutation (15.9%), H3F3A-G34R/V mutation (2.8%) and
IDH1-R132H mutation (16.8%). BRAF-V600E mutation
was frequently identiﬁed in pediatric low-grade gliomas
including pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, ganglioglioma
and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma [14, 15]. In
contrast to these pediatric low-grade glioma subtypes,
mutation frequency was much lower in adult diffuse
gliomas [15–19]. Knobbe and co-workers investigated
94 glioblastomas and identiﬁed three cases (3.2%)
harboring BRAF mutation [16]. In the study by Schindler
and colleagues examining 1,320 nervous system tumors,
BRAF mutation was detected in less than 2% of adult
glioblastomas investigated [15]. Dahiya and colleagues
evaluated the BRAF status in 39 adult glioblastomas and
identiﬁed 7.7% (three cases) possessing the mutation [19].
The mutation was reported in up to 54% of epithelioid
glioblastoma, an uncommon histologic variant of
glioblastoma in young adults [17]. In our current study
focusing on young adult patients aged from 17 to 35
years, 15% of patients had BRAF mutation but no BRAF
mutation was identiﬁed in seven cases of secondary
young adult glioblastomas. And patients had BRAF
mutation were signiﬁcantly younger than those without
the mutation. Mutated cases had mean age of 22.3 years
and median age of 21 years, compared to mean age of 25.5
years and median age of 26 years in wild-type cases (p
= 0.013). Additionally, BRAF mutation identiﬁed a subset
of patients with favorable prognosis in our cohort. In
univariate analysis, the median overall survival of patients
with BRAF mutated glioblastomas was 43.2 months and
those with wild-type BRAF was 13.6 months (p = 0.032).
Notably, among the 16 BRAF mutated glioblastomas,
11 cases had operation record and total resection could
be achieved in all cases (p = 0.013), suggesting BRAF
mutated glioblastomas were more amendable to surgical
resection. Seven cases received concomitant chemotherapy
and radiotherapy, out of nine cases with adjuvant treatment
data available. Since majority of the BRAF mutated tumors
received total resection and concomitant chemo-radiation
which could account for the favorable outcome of this
subset of patient in our cohort, we tried to analyze the
prognostic value of BRAF mutation in patients receiving
total resection and concomitant chemoradiation (n = 37).
Seven BRAF mutated tumors showed strong trend of better
prognosis than 30 BRAF wild-type tumors (Supplementary

the ETS system [41–43]. The synergistic effect of BRAFV600E and TERTp mutations in promoting tumorigenesis
was therefore biologically explainable [38]. Although
only 2.9% (3/104) of patients harbored concurrent BRAFV600E and TERTp mutation, this subgroup accounted for
18.8% (3/16) of BRAF mutated glioblastomas of young
adults. Further study should be conducted to evaluate the
clinical value of concurrent BRAF and TERTp mutations
in young adult glioblastomas.
In summary, our study demonstrates recurrent
BRAF, IDH1 and H3F3A mutations in young adult
glioblastomas with clinical impacts. BRAF mutation and
IDH1 mutation identify glioblastomas with less aggressive
clinical course and H3F3A-K27M mutation deﬁnes
glioblastomas with dismal prognosis. The biomarkerbased stratiﬁcation has clinical implications and reﬁnes
the prognostic classiﬁcation of young adult glioblastomas.

mutated tumors warranted further evaluation in a larger
cohort.
IDH1 mutation was present in 16.8% of young
adult glioblastomas of which the mutation frequency was
comparatively higher than the predominant group of adult /
elderly glioblastoma as well as pediatric glioblastomas
[8, 9, 24–27]. Previous study by Pollack and colleagues
reported that IDH1 mutation was common in adolescent
malignant gliomas in which 16.3% of high grade gliomas
between 3 to 21 years harbored the mutation and was
signiﬁcantly associated with age greater than 14 years
[28]. As expected, IDH1 mutated glioblastomas showed
favorable prognosis in our cohort which was independent
of age, tumor location, operation and adjuvant treatment
among the young adult patients. Favorable prognostic
value of IDH1 mutation was also recently demonstrated
in pediatric glioblastomas [9]. Notably, although IDH1
mutation was identiﬁed in nearly 90% of secondary elderly
glioblastomas [27], only 43% (3/7) of IDH1 mutation was
detected in our young adult glioblastomas, suggesting that
IDH1 mutation wasn’t a main contributing marker for
young secondary glioblastomas. Collectively, our study
provided complementary evidence to previous studies that
IDH1 mutated glioblastoma was a glioblastoma subgroup
with favorable prognosis prevalent in adolescents and
young adults [11].
Hotspot mutations in TERT promoter region were
identiﬁed in up to 80% of adult / elderly glioblastomas
[29–31] but rare in pediatric glioblastomas [32]. The
prevalence of TERTp mutation in the young adult age
group was not precisely reported. In our study, only 8.7%
of young adult glioblastomas harbored TERTp mutation,
suggesting that mutation induced telomerase activation
might not be a major mechanism in telomere deregulation
in that age group. It remained to be investigated if promoter
methylation of TERT causing telomerase upregulation or
the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) represented
the major mechanism of telomere maintenance in young
adult glioblastomas [6, 33]. TERTp mutations were
associated with poor prognosis in glioblastomas [30, 31,
34, 35] as well as lower-grade gliomas with wild-type IDH
[34, 36, 37]. Although not reached statistical signiﬁcance,
the median overall survival of patients with TERTp
mutated glioblastomas was only 5.1 months, compared to
15.6 months in those with wild-type TERTp. Notably, three
TERTp mutations were overlapped with BRAF-V600E
mutation in the cohort and overall survival was 5.1 months
in one patient with survival data available. BRAF-V600E
and TERTp mutations were recently found cooperatively
identifying the most aggressive subset of papillary thyroid
cancer with high recurrence rate [38]. TERTp mutations,
either C228T or C250T, generated a consensus binding
site (5′-TTCC-3′) for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription
factors and upregulated TERT expression [34, 39, 40]. On
the other hand, activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathway was also shown to cause upregulation of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
A total of 107 tissue samples (all formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded) were obtained from young adult
patients (age from 17–35 years) of Department of
Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales
Hospital (Hong Kong) and Department of Neurosurgery,
Huashan hospital (Shanghai) with a histological diagnosis
of “glioblastoma, WHO grade IV”. Seven out of the
107 samples were secondary glioblastomas progressed
from low grade gliomas, including oligoastrocytoma and
astrocytoma. Other 102 cases were diagnosed as primary
glioblastomas. Clinical and survival data of the patients
were retrieved from the respective institutional medical
record systems. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shanghai Huashan Hospital and the New
Territories East Cluster-Chinese University of Hong Kong
Ethics Committee.

Molecular analysis
Mutational analysis was performed as described
previously [36, 44]. Tissues from representative tumor area
with tumor content 70% were scrapped off from dewaxed
sections and treated with proteinase K at a ﬁnal concentration
of 2 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at 55°C for
2–18 hours and then at 98°C for 10 minutes. Crude cell lysate
was centrifuged and supernatant was used for subsequent
PCR analysis. The forward and reverse primers then were
used to amplify gene BRAF, H3F3A, HIST1H3B, IDH1
and TERT. PCR was performed in 10ul reaction mixture for
different thermal protocol (Supplementary Table S1, S2).
Sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing kit v1.1 (Life Technologies). The products
were resolved in Genetic Analyzer 3130 × l and analyzed
by Sequencing Analysis software. Hotspots BRAF-V600E,

analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall survival (OS) was
deﬁned as the duration between the diagnosis and death
or last follow-up [25]. Survival curves were plotted by
Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by Log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis for independent prognostic marker
was performed by Cox-proportional hazards model. Tests
with a p value below 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for
EGFR ampliﬁcation and CDKN2A deletion
Dual-probe ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
assay was performed on parafﬁn-embedded sections,
with locus-speciﬁc probes for EGFR and CDKN2A
paired with centromere probes for chromosome 7p12 and
chromosome 9p21 (Supplementary Figure S1, Table S4).
Deparafﬁnization of the sections was carried out, followed
by dehydration in 100% ethanol, retrieval by 1M sodium
thiocyanate at 80°C for 10 minutes, and digestion in 0.04%
pepsin at 37°C was applied on each section for 10 minutes.
Simultaneous probe per specimen was denatured at 80°C
for 10 minutes with subsequent overnight incubation at
37°C. The sections were washed next day in 1.5 M Urea/2X
saline sodium citrate at 50°C for 10 minutes twice. After
washing, sections were stained with Vectashield mounting
medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories) and visualized under a ﬂuorescent microscope
(Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, NY, USA). Hybridizing
signals in at least 100 non-overlapping nuclei were counted.
EGFR ampliﬁcation was considered when 50% of the tumor
cells harbored more than ﬁve signals per nuclei CEP7 or
innumerable tight clusters of signals of the locus probe [45].
CDKN2A deletion was considered if both signals were lost
(homozygous deletion) in at least 20% of tumor nuclei [46].

Immunohistochemistry of PDGFRA
FFPE tissue sections of 4 micron thickness were
deparafﬁnized in xylene and rehydrated in graded
alcohols. For PDGFRA, antigen retrieval was carried out
by treating the sections in 1M Citrate buffer (PH = 6.0) in a
microwave oven. After antigen retrieval, all sections were
processed by BondMax automade staining systems (Leica
BondMax) using validated protocols. Tissue sections were
incubated at 37°C for 30 mins with relevant antibodies of
PDGFRA (Supplementary Table S3). Antigen detection
was performed using Ultra View diamino benzidine
chromogen step (BondMax). The presence of cytoplasmic
and membrane staining indicated positivity for PDGFRA
[47] (Supplementary Figure S1, Table S5).
