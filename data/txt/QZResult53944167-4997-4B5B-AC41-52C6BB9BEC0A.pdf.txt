with tolerance for self-constituents (1). Pathologic imbalances of
Treg are found in two major disease classes, i.e., autoimmune
diseases and cancers. Whereas in autoimmune diseases, low Treg
levels contribute to the failure to protect the body from its own
defense mechanisms (2–4), recent studies indicate an overrepresentation of Treg in the peripheral blood of patients with solid
tumors (5–10). Furthermore, an increased accumulation of Treg in
the tumor mass goes along with an adverse prognosis (11, 12).
Those observations not only contradict the concept of immunoignorance, but they suggest an alternative functional explanation
for tumor immunity: tumor-induced dysregulation would exhibit
tolerance, impeding a self-protective immune response. The tumor
development thus would be promoted in part by the immune
system itself, i.e., the suppressive function of Treg. Thus, Treg could
be an important variable to be measured in diagnostic and patient
monitoring settings.
An increasingly explored option for the therapy of solid tumors
and other diseases is the modulation of the immune system. For
instance, patients with melanomas and kidney cancer are treated
by the administration of an immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is thought to activate natural killer (NK) cells
and T cells. Recent reports suggest that Treg proliferation is also
triggered by IL-2, which would constitute an adverse effect for the
intended immune activation of the therapy (13–16). A converse
approach is pursued in immunosuppression therapies for transplantations, in which the intention is to abrogate host versus graft
and graft versus host reactions. For that, T lymphocytes are blocked
or eliminated. Modern therapies use antibodies, such as thymoglobuline (rabbit ATG) and basiliximab. rATG is a polyclonal
antibody reactive against a variety of T-cell antigens and has been
shown to efficiently eradicate T-lymphocytes (17). Basiliximab is a
chimeric mouse human monoclonal antibody directed against the
IL-2Ra (CD25; ref. 18). Binding of basiliximab to its target
effectively inhibits T-cell signaling. In order to judge the efficacy
of those therapies, it is important to measure the actual cellular
effects of both stimulation (such as IL-2 treatment) and
immunosuppression (basiliximab and rATG). Accordingly, immunomonitoring strategies are a crucial diagnostic and analytic
component during the development or even in the clinical routine
application of those therapies. Within the monitoring concepts,
it is of particular value to quantitatively determine Treg because—
in healthy individuals—they are naturally responsible for the
regulation of an adequate immune response. However, precise Treg
measurement has thus far remained awkward. Initially, CD4+ Treg
were characterized by high expression levels of CD25, which is a

Abstract
Regulatory T-cells (Treg) have been the focus of immunologic
research due to their role in establishing tolerance for
harmless antigens versus allowing immune responses against
foes. Increased Treg frequencies measured by mRNA expression or protein synthesis of the Treg marker FOXP3 were
found in various cancers, indicating that dysregulation of
Treg levels contributes to tumor establishment. Furthermore, they constitute a key target of immunomodulatory
therapies in cancer as well as transplantation settings. One
core obstacle for understanding the role of Treg, thus far, is
the inability of FOXP3 mRNA or protein detection methods to
differentiate between Treg and activated T cells. These
difficulties are aggravated by the technical demands of
sample logistics and processing. Based on Treg-specific DNA
demethylation within the FOXP3 locus, we present a novel
method for monitoring Treg in human peripheral blood and
solid tissues. We found that Treg numbers are significantly
increased in the peripheral blood of patients with interleukin
2–treated melanoma and in formalin-fixed tissue from
patients with lung and colon carcinomas. Conversely, we
show that immunosuppressive therapy including therapeutic
antibodies leads to a significant reduction of Treg from the
peripheral blood of transplantation patients. In addition,
Treg numbers are predictively elevated in the peripheral
blood of patients with various solid tumors. Although our
data generally correspond to data obtained with gene expression and protein-based methods, the results are less fluctuating and more specific to Treg. The assay presented here
measures Treg robustly in blood and solid tissues regardless
of conservation levels, promising fast screening of Treg in
various clinical settings. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):599–608]

component of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor (1). Although CD25
has always been known to be a rather unspecific activation marker,
the identification of the forkhead box transcription factor
(FOXP3)—as a constitutively expressed master switch for Treg
development—has provided a powerful marker and an essential
tool for analyzing and understanding the role of Treg (19–22). The
specificity of FOXP3 expression in Treg was shown in the murine
immune system using transgenic animals harboring FOXP3
promoter–driven reporter genes (23). High levels of FOXP3
expression were also found in human natural CD25highCD4+ Treg.
As a marker for human Treg, however, FOXP3 mRNA expression
and protein synthesis is of doubtful value, due to the transient
expression of FOXP3 in activated nonregulatory effector T cells
(24–26). Thus, in the absence of a specific Treg marker, the
interpretation of FOXP3+ and/or CD25+ Treg remained ambiguous
because the measurements employed determine a mixture of
activated conventional T cells and natural Treg. In addition,
quantification of Treg by measuring FOXP3 and CD25 in solid
tissues using immunohistochemical methods remains experimentally demanding, error-prone, and difficult to objectively standardize (27). Far-reaching clinical decisions within routine applications
in such a setting are not in sight at present.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (2). January 15, 2009

We have previously shown, both in mice and men, that stable
expression of FOXP3 in naturally occurring Treg requires
epigenetic, i.e., DNA methylation–based regulation (28, 29). DNA
methylation is a biologically and chemically stable epigenetic
modification, locking long-term gene expression patterns (30–32).
Demethylation at a highly conserved region within the human
FOXP3 gene (Treg-specific demethylated region, TSDR; ref. 29) was
found to be restricted to Treg when tested against all major
peripheral blood cell types and a selection of non–blood cells. In
addition to the high specificity for Treg, it was also observed that
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation occurred only in natural Treg, but not
in recently activated effector T cells transiently expressing FOXP3
(28, 29). It was further associated with stable FOXP3 expression
upon Treg expansion in vitro. These data indicated that epigenetic
modifications in the FOXP3 TSDR serve as a valuable marker for
the identification of T cells with a stable Treg phenotype.
Here, we established a quantitative real-time PCR-based
methylation assay, which enables the specific and sensitive
determination of Treg numbers by measuring demethylated FOXP3
TSDR DNA. We addressed the question of whether the methylation
assay reliably reports Treg numbers in diagnostic or therapeutic
settings, such as IL-2 therapy for patients with melanoma and

therapies (n = 2 male, n = 4 female; mean age, 52 F 11) were also first
transplanted (kidney) and received two doses of basiliximab (20 mg i.v.
2 h before reperfusion and at day 4 posttransplantation). Maintenance
immunosuppression in both groups consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque 1.077 (Biochrom or Sigma-Aldrich).
All experiments using human material were approved by the local ethical
committee.
Peripheral blood analysis of cancer patients and healthy donors.
Samples were obtained from the sources listed below and sample numbers
received from each source are indicated in parentheses: Proteogenex (93),
Universitätsklinik des Saarlandes (n = 1), Universitätsklinikum SchleswigHolstein, Campus Lübeck (n = 2), Medizinische Hochschule Hannover
(n = 18), and Universitätsklinikum Münster (n = 2). Written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants adhering to the local
ethical guidelines. Blood was collected in one or more 10 mL BD vacutainer
tubes (BD Vacutainer Plus blood collection tube; Becton Dickinson) and
each tube immediately inverted f10 to avoid blood clotting. The blood
collection tubes were centrifuged at 1,500  g for 10 min at 4jC with
the centrifuge brake turned off. After centrifugation, f0.5 to 1 mL of
fluid including the cellular layer between plasma and erythrocytes were
transferred into a prelabeled 2 mL Cryo vial (Fisherbrand 2 mL round style
bottom cryogenic storage vials; Fisher Scientific). Samples were frozen at
80jC within 4 h of the blood draw and stored at this temperature until
shipped on dry ice. The sample collection consisted of 22 patients with
breast cancer (22 women; mean age, 60; 18 patients with stage I to II disease
and 4 patients with stage III or IV disease), 27 patients with colorectal
cancer (13 men and 14 women; mean age 64; 13 patients with stage I or
II and 14 patients with stage III or IV disease), 24 lung cancer patients
(11 male and 13 females; mean age, 62; 9 patients suffering from stage I and
II, 9 patients with stage III or IV, and 6 patients with no disease stage
information), 23 prostate cancer patients (23 male; mean age, 65;
9 with stage I/II disease, 1 with stage III/IV disease, and 13 without stage
information) and 20 normal controls (11 male and 9 female; mean age, 55).
FFPE tissues. FFPE samples from 15 patients with primary colorectal
cancer and 5 patients with stages II to IV primary lung cancer were
retrieved from the Pathology Department of Charité, Campus B.F., Berlin.
Colorectal cancer tissues had been already analyzed in a previous study for
FOXP3 expression using immunohistochemistry (35). FFPE control samples
were either from adjacent healthy colon ( five samples) and lung (one
sample) tissue from the tested patients or healthy tissue from other colon
( five samples) and lung (two samples) patients obtained during surgery. All
patients with colorectal cancer (mean age, 55 years; range, 36–73) and
controls (mean age, 58 years; rang, 48–76) were female. All lung controls
(n = 3) were male (ages 61, 65, and 67), one lung cancer patient was female
and four were male (mean age, 63 years; range, 52–74). For DNA isolation
from FFPE tissues, up to eight tissue slices were used. Slices were incubated
overnight in 50 mmol/L of Tris/HCl (pH 8), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20
containing 2 mg/mL of proteinase K with subsequent incubation at 90jC
for 10 min and DNA was purified with Qia-AMP DNA FFPE tissue kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

rATG or basiliximab treatment for transplantation patients. For the
former, we used peripheral blood from patients with melanoma
before and after completion of an IL-2 cytokine treatment. For the
latter, we analyzed peripheral blood of patients prior to and after
kidney or simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplantation, with the
antibodies administered perisurgically. We further conducted a
blinded study testing the notion that an increase of FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation in the peripheral blood would serve as an indicator
for the establishment of malignancies in patients with manifested
cancers compared with healthy controls. Finally, we conducted
studies to evaluate this real-time PCR tool in its use to quantify the
Treg number in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) solid
tissue samples, including both healthy and tumorous tissues.

Materials and Methods
Samples and Sample Preparation
Healthy donors. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy
donors after informed consent in accordance with local ethical committee
approval. For the sorting of major peripheral blood leukocyte populations,
samples were treated according to Baron and colleagues (29). Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by density gradient
centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich). CD4+ T cells were
isolated from PBMC by using anti-CD4 microbeads and the AutoMACS
magnetic separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). All microbeads were
purchased from Miltenyi Biotec and all antibodies for cell surface stainings
were from BD PharMingen. Intracellular FOXP3 staining was performed
with the PE anti-human FOXP3 staining set (eBioscience) and used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MACS-sorted CD4+ T cells
were stained using anti–CD45RAFITC and anti–CD25APC. Cells were
sorted into CD25highCD45RA Treg and CD25CD45RA+ naı̈ve T cells by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Aria, BD Bioscience). An aliquot
of the CD4 population was used to determine the content of FOXP3+ cells
by flow cytometry; here, the analyzing gates resemble the sorting gates.
Cytometric analysis was performed as previously described (33) using a
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and the FlowJo software (Tree Star).
For cell spiking, 10,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,250, and 625 purified CD25highCD4+
cells were each mixed with 2 million isolated granulocytes corresponding to
a Treg percentage of 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.13%, 0.06%, and 0.03%, respectively. Cell
mixtures were subjected to genomic DNA isolation, followed by bisulfite
treatment and methylation-sensitive FOXP3 TSDR real-time PCR (see
below). Template input per reaction corresponds to 56, 28, 14, 7, and
(approximately) 3.5 copies of Treg DNA.
Patients with melanoma following IL-2 therapy. Patients with
melanoma ( five men and one woman; mean age, 52 years; ranging from
33 to 75) with stage IV metastatic disease, received IL-2 by s.c.
administration with or without the addition of histamine dihydrochloride
as described previously (34). After informed consent according to the local
ethical guidelines, heparinized blood samples were drawn before and
2 weeks after the completion of a 4-week schedule of IL-2 therapy. PBMCs
were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque 1.077
(Biochrom or Sigma-Aldrich). For extracellular staining, the following
surface monoclonal antibodies were used: anti–CD3-PercP (clone
SK7), anti–CD25-PE (M-A251), and anti–CD4-FITC (B9.11). Nuclear anti–
FOXP3-APC staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using anti–FOXP3-APC (PCH101; eBioscience). Data acquisition
was performed on FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience).
Transplantation patients under immunosuppressive therapy.
Between October 2007 and May 2008, transplantation patients were
recruited from the Department of Surgery and Nephrology, Virchow Klinik,
Universitätsmedizin Charité, Berlin, and received a non-HLA identical
allograft from a cadaveric donor. Transplant patients (three male patients;
mean age, 48 F 13) were first transplanted (kidney/pancreas) and received
an initial 1.5 mg/kg body weight i.v. thymoglobulin (Genzyme) starting
at day 0 followed by 4 further consecutive days. Patients for basiliximab

DNA Preparation from Blood and Bisulfite Conversion
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit
(Qiagen). For PBMC and sorted blood cells, the protocol for cultured cells
was followed. For DNA isolation from buffy coats, the whole blood protocol
was used. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was performed according to
Olek and colleagues (36) with minor modifications.

Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was performed in a final reaction volume of 20 AL using
Roche LightCycler 480 Probes Master (Roche Diagnostics) containing
15 pmol each of methylation or non–methylation-specific forward and
reverse primers for TSDR, 5 pmol of hydrolysis probe, 200 ng of lambdaDNA (New England Biolabs), and 30 ng of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA
template or a respective amount of plasmid standard. Each sample was
analyzed in triplicate using a LightCycler 480 System (Roche). Cycling

conditions consisted of a 95jC preheating step for 10 min and 50 cycles of
95jC for 15 s followed by 1 min at 61jC. Methylation-specific and
demethylation-specific amplification primers for TSDR map to the following chromosomal positions: NCBI36:X:49004163-49004190:1 ( forward
primers) and NCBI36:X:49004227-49004251:1 (reverse primers). Hydrolysis
probes map to chromosomal position NCBI36:X:49004200-49004222:1
(demethylation-specific probe) and NCBI36:X:49004200-49004217:1 (methylation-specific probe).

Plasmid Standard
PCR products were generated with methyl– and non-methyl–specific
primers for FOXP3 TSDR using genomic, bisulfite-treated DNA from sorted
naı̈ve and regulatory T cells. DNA fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO
vector, using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and verified by sequencing. Plasmids were
purified with Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit, the concentration was determined
by Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and diluted to obtain final concentrations
of 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 fg representing 20,000, 2,000, 200, and 20 plasmid copies
as standard for quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions, each for methylated and
nonmethylated FOXP3 qPCR assay.

Statistical Analysis
Amounts of methylated and unmethylated FOXP3 DNA were estimated
from calibration curves by linear regression on crossing points from the
second-derivative maximum method (37). The median was used to
aggregate triplicate measurements of the buffy coat samples. The
proportion of unmethylated DNA was computed as the ratio of
unmethylated FOXP3 TSDR-DNA and the sum of methylated and
unmethylated FOXP3 TSDR-DNA. For female patients, this ratio was
corrected with a factor of 2 due to the fact that one of the two TSDR alleles
is methylated as a result of X-inactivation.
For the quantitation of the FOXP3 methylation-based discrimination
between peripheral blood of cancer patients and normal controls, the area
under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) value was
used. Here, it is equivalent to the probability that a randomly selected
cancer patient shows higher FOXP3 methylation in peripheral blood than a
randomly selected normal control. No discriminative ability corresponds to
an AUC of 0.5. A perfect discrimination has an AUC of 1.0. AUCs were
estimated by means of the trapezoidal rule. The Wilcoxon-rank sum test
was used to compare demethylation rates between normal and cancer
patients. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare demethylation rates pre– and post–IL-2 treatment. For correlation analysis, Pearson’s
product moment coefficient and t test statistics were used. All P values are
two-sided.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described
(35). In brief, slides were incubated with the rat monoclonal antibody
against human FOXP3 protein (PCH101, 1:200; eBioscience), followed by
biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-rat and the EnVision peroxidase kit (Dako).
Ten randomly selected high-power fields (1 HPF = 0.237 mm2) were
analyzed for FOXP3+ cell infiltration in tumor tissue and matched normal
colonic mucosa/lung parenchyma, and 10 HPF were averaged in each case.

Results
Methylation-sensitive FOXP3 TSDR real-time PCR system. In
order to quantitatively analyze the specificity of FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation to Treg, we established a real-time PCR system
(qPCR). This system consists of methylation-dependent amplification primers and hybridization probes for both bisulfiteconverted methylated and unmethylated DNA of the FOXP3 TSDR
(Fig. 1A). We tested this system on plasmids cloned from bisulfiteconverted Treg and naı̈ve T cell DNA. These clones contain
sequences corresponding to unmethylated or methylated bisulfite-converted FOXP3 TSDR. We showed high specificity, linearity

monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD56+ NK cells, and both CD8+
memory (CD27+CD45RA+) and CD8+ naı̈ve (CD27+CD45RA)
cytotoxic T cell fractions showed <0.5% TSDR demethylation.
CD19+ memory and naı̈ve B cell fractions comprise <2%
demethylated TSDR. CD4+CD27+CD45RA+ naı̈ve T cells and
CD4+CD27+CD45RA memory T cells contain a demethylated
fraction of 6.2% and 10.86%, respectively. Both fractions have
previously been described to contain approximately 10% of
CD25high FOXP3+ Treg. Therefore, our measurements meet the
expected rate of Treg in those fractions. As shown above in Fig.
2B, the selective removal of CD25high cells from the total CD4+
cell fraction leads to the depletion of all cells with a demethylated
FOXP3 TSDR. This fact once more suggests the specificity of
TSDR demethylation to CD25++ cells. Taken together, it seems
that only Treg are demethylated at the TSDR and a specific Treg
measurement based on the TSDR demethylation should be
feasible.
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in patients with melanoma
treated with IL-2. Next, we studied the effect of IL-2 therapy on
the frequency of CD4+CD25high Foxp3+ Treg in the PBMCs of six
patients with metastatic melanoma using both FACS and TSDR
demethylation analyses (Fig. 3A). Prior to therapy, FACS measurements of PBMC showed an average frequency of CD4+CD25high
FOXP3+ cells of 4.5% (range, 1.9–8.9%; SD, 2.4%). After 4 weeks of
an IL-2 therapy schedule followed by 2 weeks of reconvalescence,
the levels of FOXP3+ cells were measured again. Compared with
pretherapy levels, FACS data showed a significant increase with
an average of 11.6% of FOXP3 expressing cells (range, 5.1–17.3%;
SD, 4.6%; P = 0.03). When Treg frequency was determined using
the FOXP3 TSDR demethylation assay in the same samples, the
average demethylation ratio prior to IL-2 therapy was at 3.4%
(range, 2.4–4.2%; SD, 0.7%). After IL-2 therapy, Treg levels were
significantly increased showing an average demethylation level of
8.8% (range, 6.9–11.5%; SD 1.6%; P = 0.03). From two of these
patients, CD4+CD25high Treg were isolated by magnetic beads
(MACS) before and after IL-2 therapy. In both patients,
CD4+CD25high cells showed similar demethylation values ( from
87.5% to 88.3% and from 85.2% to 93.9%; data not shown). Taken
together, cell numbers as measured by FACS and FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation correlate well (Pearson correlation R = 0.65,
P = 0.023) and they seem to detect largely congruent cell populations (i.e., Treg). The previously reported increase of Treg upon
IL-2 therapy was confirmed by two independent technological
approaches.
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in immunosuppressed, solid
organ–transplanted patients. We counted Treg levels in
transplantation patients treated with the immunomodulatory
therapeutic antibodies thymoglobulin (rATG; three patients) and
basiliximab (six patients) applying the FOXP3 TSDR demethylation
assay (Fig. 3B). When demethylation prior to and after ATG
treatment was analyzed, we found that Treg levels decreased in all
three patients. Pretherapy levels ranged from 0.6% to 7.6% and
dropped to values <0.25% in each case. Statistical significance
could not be reached due to the low number of patients (n = 3)
included. When demethylation prior to and after basiliximab
therapy was analyzed, we found a significant decrease of Treg
levels (P = 0.03) for all samples with an average pretherapy
demethylation level of f1.6% (range, 0.6–4.3%), and an average
posttherapy demethylation level of 0.66% (range, 0.02–2.2%). Taken
together, we see a significant decline of Treg levels upon the
described immunosuppressive therapies.

of amplification over six orders of magnitude, and no crossreactivity with the opposite template species, even at unphysiologically high concentrations (ranging from 20 to 200 million
copies of plasmid DNA; Fig. 1B).
With technical variables specified, we compared the performance of conventional FACS analysis for Treg detection with the
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation assay. For this, we used sorted
CD25highCD4+ T cells and CD25CD4+ conventional T cells from
healthy male and female donors. Flow cytometry analysis revealed
FOXP3 expression in >95% of CD25high Treg and up to 4.3% in
CD25CD4+ conventional T cells (Fig. 2A). Demethylation analysis
confirmed these findings with f93% of the CD25high Treg
showing an unmethylated FOXP3 TSDR in male donors and 45.9%
in female donors (f92% of the cells, when corrected with a
factor of 2 owing to inactivation and methylation of one Xchromosome). Among CD4+CD25 cells, <1% were demethylated
in the FOXP3 TSDR (Fig. 2B). Treg content in CD4+CD25high as
determined by TSDR analysis is somewhat lower than observed
with FOXP3 expression analysis, suggesting superimposition by
activated non–Treg in the latter procedure. Equally, TSDR
demethylation is lower in naı̈ve T cells than determined by FACS
analysis, suggesting that impurities retained during CD25 sorting
mainly originated from CD25medium cells, which may express
FOXP3 to some extent but are not exhibiting bona fide natural
Treg with the CD25high, FOXP3 TSDR demethylated Treg phenotype. However, altogether, a good correlation between both
detection methods was observed.
Next, the assay sensitivity was tested in an in vitro system. For
this, we added a gradually decreasing amount of sorted Tregs into
a constant number of control cells (granulocytes), which have
been shown to be completely methylated in the FOXP3 TSDR
(ref. 29; see also next paragraph). We robustly detected 0.5%,
0.25%, 0.13%, and 0.06% Treg. The detection limit was at 0.03%
Treg corresponding to approximately 3.5 copies of unmethylated
template DNA in 12,000 copies of methylated background DNA
(Fig. 2C).
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in sorted blood cell subtypes.
For the presented assay, it is a prerequisite for Treg measurement
in full blood that all non-Treg blood fractions are overwhelmingly
methylated in the FOXP3 TSDR. Thus, to characterize biological
specificity, we analyzed the methylation level in various leukocyte
fractions. Results are summarized in Table 1. Isolated CD14+

FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in peripheral blood of patients
with cancer and healthy donors. Next, we tested if an upregulation of Treg numbers was observed in the peripheral blood of
patients suffering from solid tumors using the FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation assay. For this, we measured the methylation status
of the FOXP3 TSDR in the leukocyte fraction of a total of 115 blood
samples from healthy controls, colorectal, lung, prostate, and
breast cancer patients in a blinded study ( for sample preparation
and characteristics, see Materials and Methods). For healthy
donors, the average Treg frequency was at 1.4%, ranging from
0.4% to 2.9%. For patients with colorectal cancer, the Treg
concentration was at 2.3%, ranging from 0.6% to 3.5% with one
outlier at 19%. Excluding the outlier, the average Treg frequency
was at 1.6%, only slightly higher than for healthy donors. Treg
concentration in lung cancer patients ranged from 0.5% to 4.4%
with an average of 2.3%. Although results for patients with
colorectal cancer did not significantly differ from normal controls,
Treg frequencies in patients with lung cancer were significantly
elevated (P = 0.003). ROC curves for colon and lung cancer show an
AUC (see Materials and Methods: Statistical Analysis) of 0.66 for
colon and an AUC of 0.75 for lung cancer (Fig. 4A). A separate
analysis of Treg levels in male and female lung cancer patients
and comparison with gender-matched controls shows similar
AUC values (male lung cancer AUC = 0.73; female lung cancer
AUC = 0.74); however, comparisons are no longer significant (male
lung cancer P = 0.076; female lung cancer P = 0.071). When
comparing Treg frequencies in breast and prostate cancer patients
to healthy controls of the same sex, the average Treg concentration
was elevated to 2.4% for both cancer types, compared with 1.7% in
female and 1.4% in male normal controls. The changes, compared
with normal individuals, were statistically significant for prostate
cancer (P = 0.03) and slightly below significance for breast cancer
(P = 0.08). ROC curves showed an AUC of 0.71 for discriminating
between normal females and those with breast cancer and an AUC
of 0.73 for discriminating between normal males and those with
prostate cancer (Fig. 4B).
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in FFPE tissue samples. Finally,
we asked if measurement of FOXP3 TSDR demethylation might
resolve the technical issues encountered with current methods to
detect Treg in solid tissues. We selected FFPE samples from non–
small cell lung and colon carcinoma and corresponding adjacent
normal tissue. On the one hand, samples were measured using
immunohistochemistry, detecting the number of FOXP3+ cells in
tissue sections per HPF (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, we used
material from the same paraffin blocks for Treg quantification
by measurement of FOXP3 TSDR demethylation. When using
immunohistochemistry, higher concentrations of Treg were found
in colorectal cancer tissue (average immunohistochemistry cell
number, 15.3 Treg/HPF; range, 4.4–52 Treg/HPF) when compared
with normal adjacent colon tissue (average immunohistochemistry
cell number, 0.3 Treg/HPF; range, 0.1–0.6 Treg/HPF). When the
concentration of Treg in colorectal cancer tissue was analyzed
using FOXP3 TSDR demethylation assay, an average demethylation
of 6.3% was observed, ranging from 1.9% to 12.3%. In healthy
control tissue, on average, 1.5% Treg were measured ranging from
0.8% to 2.8%. For both technologies, the tumor-specific increase of
Treg infiltration is statistically highly significant (P < 0.001). For
lung tissue, immunohistochemistry measurements showed an
increase of Treg in tumor tissue (average immunohistochemistry
cell number, 6.8 Treg/HPF; range, 3.9–10.1 Treg/HPF) compared
with normal lung tissue (average immunohistochemistry cell

FOXP3 TSDR demethylation analysis, average Treg levels were at
3.8%, ranging from 1.6% to 6.4% for cancerous tissue and average
demethylation levels were at 0.7% for healthy tissue, ranging from
0.5% to 0.8%. Despite the limited amount of lung tissue samples
included in this study, the observed changes are statistically
significant (P = 0.036 for immunohistochemistry and FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation). Further statistical analysis showed that the
determination of FOXP3+ cells by immunohistochemistry and
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation analyses are highly correlated
(Pearson correlation R = 0.80; P < 0.001; Fig. 5B). To compare the
performances of the technologies, we used the nonparametric test
of DeLong (38). Immunohistochemical analysis showed a perfect
separation between normal and cancerous tissues (AUC = 1.0).
FOXP3 TSDR methylation analysis showed an almost perfect
separation (AUC = 0.96). Based on these two AUC values, there is
no significant difference between the immunohistochemical and

data show that both measurement methods are equivalent as far as
distinction is concerned.

than Treg, including B cells, is most likely attributed to incomplete
purification by the flow cytometric sorting schemes used (Table 1).
Physiologic Treg levels are assumed to range between 0.5% and 5%
in the peripheral blood and at f0.1% in healthy other tissues
(27, 39, 40). Thus, the observed detection limit of the FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation assay (0.03%) qualifies for accurate Treg measurements in all clinical settings (Fig. 2). Although our analyses prove
specificity within the blood components, eventually, it will be
necessary to analyze the epigenetic profile of further, nonhematopoietic cell types to show the universal applicability of this
system. This is particularly significant because recent data indicate
that FOXP3 mRNA expression has been observed to act as a tumor
suppressor in non-Treg in solid tissues (41), a fact that might or
might not be reflected in the epigenetic pattern. The universal
applicability of this assay might also be impaired by differences
between male and female donors. The straight correction by a
factor of 2, which we used to compensate for the X-inactivation,
does not take into account possible biological differences between
the two sexes, such as increased tolerance of foreign antigens
during pregnancy, which might require elevated Treg levels (42).
In awareness of the specifications and limitations referred to, we
intended to use the newly developed assay in a number of possible
routine applications in clinical settings.

Discussion
Over the last decade, Tregs have become a central focus of
immunologic research and an important player in tumor immunity
(1, 2, 15). In order to understand the role of Treg in disease settings,
it is of paramount importance to be able to specifically detect and
quantify the number of Tregs present in peripheral blood or
disease-inflicted tissue. Once possible, Treg counts might serve as
an important diagnostic and prognostic variable. However, current
detection methods for Treg do not allow for exact quantification
due to the absence of cell type specificity in the FOXP3 and CD25
mRNA and protein markers used (26, 27). All evidence from our
previous studies (28, 29) suggested that demethylation of the
FOXP3 TSDR is exclusive for stable bona fide Treg. Thus, its
measurement seemed highly suitable for the establishment of a
quantitative Treg assay. When transformed onto a qPCR platform
(Fig. 1), FOXP3 TSDR demethylation showed high biological
specificity to Treg when all major leukocyte fractions were
analyzed. Residual FOXP3 TSDR demethylation in cell types other

together, we show that the effects of both, immunostimulatory and
immunosuppressive therapy on Treg levels can be monitored using
the presented qPCR assay.
We then investigated the idea that the FOXP3 TSDR demethylation assay might provide a new, early indicator for the body’s
response to the existence of solid tumors, which can be analyzed in
peripheral blood. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a blinded
study that included patients with breast, prostate, colon, and lung
tumors and compared those with healthy donors. In line with recent
reports (39, 40), we showed that in blood from patients with lung
and prostate cancers, significantly higher signals of Treg, i.e.,
demethylated FOXP3 TSDR, were found compared with healthy
controls. For patients with breast cancer, the Treg frequency
determined by the demethylation assay was scarcely nonsignificant
(P = 0.08) but still distinctly higher than in controls (Fig. 4). The
results of FOXP3 TSDR demethylation analysis in the peripheral
blood of patients with colon cancer differ from previous results
obtained by FACS, which showed an increase of FOXP3+ cells
compared with normal controls (45, 46). These differences might
reflect the fact that the demethylation assay exclusively detects
natural Treg. This is in contrast with the FACS analysis, which also
detects other fractions of T cells transiently expressing FOXP3.
Thus, if we speculate that all tumors take advantage of some
suppressive immune function, it may be that the FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation assay falls short of identifying important other
(transiently) FOXP3-expressing suppressive cells. Those cells may
govern tumor immunity in colorectal cancer. Further research on
both natural Treg and those other suppressive cell types is required.
The search for epigenetic detection systems for these other cell
types, including Tr1 cells, is ongoing in our laboratory.
Analysis of a larger number of patients and controls may clarify
its significance to breast cancer and reconfirm those for lung and
prostate cancer. Because it is assumed that markers which identify
tumor patients with an AUC value of >0.7 are considered as
potential diagnostic tools (47), FOXP3 TSDR demethylation could

We measured blood samples from melanoma patients that had
received IL-2 treatment. Although aiming at enhancing NK and
T cell responses, recent observations suggested a significant increase of Treg numbers following IL-2 treatment (13, 16). These
observations ignited a debate as to whether this treatment would be
beneficial (due to the intended enhancement of NK and T effector
cells) or adverse (due to enhancement of the immunosuppressive
activity of Treg) to cure. Complicating this debate is the question of
whether the IL-2–induced FOXP3+ T cells are bona fide Tregs. Data
about their suppressive function are inconsistent (14–16) and
transient expression of FOXP3 is also an established property of
activated effector T cells (24). Our data now confirm that cells with
multiple Treg characteristics including CD25 and FOXP3 expression
and FOXP3 TSDR demethylation are up-regulated after IL-2 therapy
(Fig. 3A). Although still falling short of a functional test, these
findings reiterate those concerns that IL-2 therapies stimulate
natural Treg (16).
A converse treatment strategy is used for immunosuppression of
transplantation patients. Transplantation patients receiving rATG
showed a dramatic decrease of Treg (Fig. 3B), as would be expected
from a therapy that unselectively depletes T cells. We also see a—
less pronounced, but consistent for all tested patients—decrease of
Treg following basiliximab therapy (Fig. 3B). The latter observation
is unexpected because previous studies do not report a Treg
decrease. Basiliximab’s mode of action has been described as solely
blocking the IL-2a receptor (CD25) without initiating cell depletion
(43, 44). We cannot pinpoint the observed decrease of Treg on
basiliximab exclusively because the therapy regimen includes other
potent immunosuppressive factors, such as calcineurin inhibitors
(tacrolimus), antiproliferate agents (mycophenolate mofetil), and
corticosteroids (prednisone). At this point in time, we do not
speculate on effects leading to or caused by the observed decrease
of Treg during basiliximab treatment. Instead, our rationale behind
the analyses performed was to exemplarily show that the qPCR
assay is capable of monitoring the patients’ Treg status. Taken

tumors (48) as reported for invasive breast, pancreas (6), hepatic
(5), and lung (49) tumors. The implementation of a precise and
routine testing of solid tissues for Treg becomes particularly
important because there are various reports which suggest Treg as
an important prognostic factor for disease outcome, as shown for
ovarian cancer or breast cancer (11, 12).
In conclusion, we believe that the presented assay for
quantitative Treg detection will, in the future, lead to better
interstudy comparability, and faster and more efficient analysis
even of FFPE tissues. Furthermore, our findings render the
measurement of Treg frequency by analysis of the FOXP3 TSDR
methylation status a prime target not only for early tumor
recognition but also for monitoring antitumor strategies.

serve as an early detection marker for breast, lung, and prostate
cancers. In our view, two major conclusions can be drawn from the
results presented here: (a) this study encourages the idea to
monitor Treg levels as variables for malignant tumor development
in the body or the risk thereof; (b) further extensive studies are
required for the various cancer entities and therapeutic approaches
in order to validate FOXP3 TSDR demethylation as a marker in the
various settings.
We also investigated the applicability of the FOXP3 TSDR
demethylation assay as an alternative for the laborious and
sometimes imprecise and biased immunohistochemistry analyses
currently used for the measurement of Treg in fixed tissue samples
(Fig. 5). Our analyses showed that the performance of both
technologies is equivalent as far as distinction of cancer compared
with healthy tissue is concerned. When taking into account that
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation is fully quantitative, performed
without field/slide selection bias, is technically less demanding
and independent of antibody performances, it seems to be the
adequate tool for routine applications. Consequently, we believe
that the low technical demands of the assay here will allow a
significant acceleration of research and standardization of routine
testing of tumor-infiltrating Treg. Biologically, our data obtained
with both FOXP3 TSDR demethylation and immunohistochemistry
assays confirm an accumulation of Treg in lung and colon
carcinoma tissue compared with their healthy adjacent tissues.
This supports previous findings which suggest that an increased
prevalence of Treg in the microenvironments of solid epithelial
