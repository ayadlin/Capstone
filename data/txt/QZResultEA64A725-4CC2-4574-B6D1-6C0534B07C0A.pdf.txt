BACKGROUND. The authors assessed patterns of perioperative chemotherapy use
in elderly patients with resected stage I, II, or IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) from 1992 to 2002.

METHODS. By using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program, 11,807 patients were identified who had resected stage I, II, or IIIA
NSCLC between 1992 and 2002 and survived 120 days beyond diagnosis. The

rate of perioperative chemotherapy use was measured by calendar year, and the
association between clinical/demographic characteristics and the receipt of
chemotherapy was examined by using logistic regression.

RESULTS. In total, 957 patients with stage I, II, or IIIA NSCLC (8.1% of the study

receiving chemotherapy for stage I NSCLC changed little during the study period.
Of 3230 patients with stage II and IIIA NSCLC, 609 patients (18.9%) received
chemotherapy, 423 patients (13%) received chemotherapy combined with radiation. 452 patients (15.6%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 66 patients
(2.3%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The use of chemotherapy increased
significantly among patients who were diagnosed after 1994 relative to patients
who were diagnosed in 1992 after controlling for sociodemographic and treatment characteristics (P < .001). There was significantly increased use of new-generation chemotherapy agents, such as carboplatin and taxanes (P < .001). The
proportion of patients receiving combined-modality therapy also increased significant (P < .001). Younger age, being married, having advanced-stage tumor or adenocarcinoma, having a later diagnosis year, receiving radiation, and seeing an

ung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading
cause of cancer-related death in the U.S., with 174,470 new diagnoses and 163,460 deaths in 2006.1 The majority of patients with
lung cancer have nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).2 The most
effective treatment for stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC is surgical resection. Despite surgical resection, from 50% to 60% of patients relapse
and die from their lung cancer.3 Systemic recurrence has been
reported as the most frequent type of failure in patients with
NSCLC,4 and it is postulated that >75% of deaths are related to

disease relapse, especially distant metastases.5
Because of these recurrences, the 5-year survival rate
of patients with early-stage NSCLC, despite complete
resection, ranges from 45% to 70%.5,6 After other
solid cancers (ie, breast, colon), effective adjuvant
therapy theoretically should include systemic chemotherapy. Many attempts have been made in the past
to reduce the risk of relapse and death from lung
cancer by administering adjuvant chemotherapy to
patients after surgical resection.
In 1995, a meta-analysis of postoperative chemotherapy in NSCLC by the British Medical Council
indicated a 13% reduction in the hazard of death,
leading to a 5% absolute improvement in survival
5 years after the start of adjuvant cisplatin-based
chemotherapy compared with observation only.7
Although this trend did not reach statistical significance, the findings led to multiple national and
international trials that were powered adequately to
find an absolute benefit of 5% at 5 years. Results of
these trials have been reported in the last 5 years.8–16
In 2003, the abstract of the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) study, which was presented at the Annual Meeting of American Society of
Clinical Oncology, first demonstrated a survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.8 In 2004, chemotherapy became the standard of care in the U.S., when
the IALT trial demonstrated that, compared with
surgery alone, cisplatin-based adjuvant therapy
improved the 5-year survival rate by 40% to 44.5% in
patients with resected NSCLC.9
To our knowledge, there is little information
regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients with resectable NSCLC outside clinical
trials. It is known that the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials.17 For example, the median
age in the IALT trial was 59 years (range, 27–
77 years).8,9 We used data from the population-based
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)Medicare database to study the trend in receipt of
chemotherapy during the decade from 1992 to 2002
to investigate factors associated with use of perioperative chemotherapy among elderly patients with
resected NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Cohort
The study cohort was comprised of patients who
were registered in the National Cancer Institute’s
SEER Program from 1992 to 2002. The SEER Program
collects uniformly reported data from 11 populationbased cancer registries covering approximately 14%
of the U.S. population.18 For each incident cancer,

383

the SEER registries collect information on patients’
tumor characteristics, demographic characteristics,
and month and year of diagnosis. Since 1991, SEER
data have been merged with Medicare administrative
data by a matching algorithm that has successfully
linked files for >94% of SEER registry patients who
were diagnosed at age 65 years. The Medicare
claims files contain extensive diagnostic, treatment,
and cost data for patients who are covered by Medicare. In 1993, these 2 databases were linked.19
We identified 34,511 patients aged >66 years
who were diagnosed with NSCLC between 1992 and
2002 (SEER codes 34.0–34.9 and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second edition
[ICD-O-2] morphology codes 8010–8040, 8050–8076,
8140, 8250–8260, 8310, 8320, 8323, 8430, 8470–8490,
8550–8573, 8980, and 8981). We excluded patients
without Medicare Part A and Part B coverage during
the year before and the 120 days after diagnosis and
those who were members of a health maintenance
organization (n 5 9709 patients for both exclusions).

Identification of Staging and Surgical Procedures
We defined resection surgery as wedge resection,
pneumonectomy, or lobectomy that occurred within
4 months after the diagnosis of NSCLC from both
the site-specific surgery code in SEER and Medicare
claims. The IDC ninth revision, clinical modification
(ICD-9-CM) and Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes were taken from outpatient and inpatient billing claims and were used to define the following procedures: pneumonectomy (ICD9-CM codes
32.50 and 32.60; CPT codes 32,440, 32,442, and
32,445), lobectomy (ICD9-CM code 32.40; CPT codes
32,480, 32,482, 32,484, and 32,486), and wedge resection (ICD9-CM codes 32.29 and 32.30; CPT code
32,500). Of 24,802 patients who met the selection
criteria, 11,807 patients underwent resection.
Identification of Chemotherapy and Radiation Treatment
We used the Health Care Financing Administration’s
Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) to
identify patients who received a specific chemotherapeutic drug within 120 days after their NSCLC diagnosis according to their physician claims or their
hospital outpatient claims files. We chose the 120day window to differentiate initial adjuvant treatment
from treatment at relapse. In addition, using Level II
HCPCS codes (J9XXX, 96,400–96,549), ICD-9-CM
diagnostic codes (V581, V662, and V672), revenue
codes (0331, 0332, and 0335), and a procedure code
(9925) from physician claims files or outpatient or
admission hospital claims, we searched for evidence
of other chemotherapy delivery. Among patients

without specific J9XXX chemotherapy HCPCS codes,
these codes were used to capture evidence that an
unspecified chemotherapeutic drug had been given
during the 120 days after diagnosis. We defined
radiation therapy within 120 days after cancer diagnosis through the radiation code in SEER and Medicare claims.

Identification of Patients Seeing a Medical Oncologist
We defined the patient as one who ‘‘saw a medical
oncologist’’ if the patient had a physician claim
within the 4-month period from the month of diagnosis and the physician specialty (primary or secondary) was medical oncology or hematology based
on data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS). The physician claims have a 2-digit
CMS provider specialty code (90 for medical oncologist, 83 for hematology oncologist) that represents
the specialty reported to the carrier who processed
the claim.18
Definition of Explanatory Variables
Our analysis of use of adjuvant chemotherapy by
year was adjusted by the following patient-level variables: sex, race, marital status, age at diagnosis,
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor
grade, histology type, and SEER site. The socioeconomic characteristics of each patient were based on
the percentage of adults with <12 years of education
and the percentage of residents living below the poverty level from census tract data. To assess the prevalence of comorbid disease in our cohort, we
calculated the Charlson comorbidity index by identifying billing codes for various conditions during the
year before diagnosis of cancer using the Deyo
implementation of the Charlson score applied to
both inpatient and outpatient claims.19 Hospital
affiliation with a medical school was available from
the SEER-Medicare Hospital file and was categorized
as no, limited, graduate, and major affiliation. The
number of beds at each hospital also was available
from the SEER-Medicare Hospital file.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.13; SAS Inc., Cary, NC). We measured
the proportion of patients with resected NSCLC who
underwent adjuvant chemotherapy in each calendar
year stratified by stage. We performed univariate and
multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate
the association between other clinical and demographic characteristics and adjuvant chemotherapy
use. Covariates included sex, race, age, marital status,

RESULTS
Receipt and Predictors of Perioperative Chemotherapy
In total, 11,807 patients with stage I, II, or IIIA
underwent surgical resection during the study period. Among them, 957 patients (8.1% of the study
population) received perioperative chemotherapy.
The proportion of patients with stage I NSCLC
receiving chemotherapy changed little over the study
period (Fig. 1). Next, we focused our attention on the
3230 patients with stage II or IIIA NSCLC who underwent resection. Table 1 shows the demographic and
clinical characteristics of those 3230 patients and the
percentage in each subgroup who received chemotherapy. Overall, 609 patients (18.9%) received perioperative chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was delivered
postoperatively to 15.6% of patients and preoperatively
to 2.3% of patients. Combined-modality therapy
(chemotherapy and radiation therapy) were delivered
to 423 patients (13%), and chemotherapy alone was
delivered to 186 patients (5.8%).
Younger patients were more likely than older
patients to receive chemotherapy. For patients ages
66 to 69 years and aged 80 years, chemotherapy
use declined from 25.8% to 9% (P < .0001). Among
patients who had stage II NSCLC, 13.3% received
chemotherapy compared with 24.5% of patients who
had stage IIIA NSCLC (P < .0001). In addition to age
and advanced stage, having an adenocarcinoma histology (P < .0001), having a later diagnosis year
(P < .0001), being married (P < .0001), receiving
radiation (P < .0001), and seeing an oncologist
(P < .0001) were associated with chemotherapy use

Receiving care in a nonteaching hospital also
was associated with a higher rate of adjuvant chemotherapy use than receiving care in a teaching hospital
in univariate analysis (Table 1). However, this factor
became nonsignificant in multivariate analyses (Table

were not associated with use of perioperative chemotherapy after adjusting for other variables in this cohort

in the early 1990s, reached to its peak around 1997/
1998 for stage II and around 1999/2000 for stage IIIA,
and slowly declined afterward. The use of chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA NSCLC increased
again around 2000 (Fig. 1). The time trend for the
proportion of patients who received combinedmodality therapy and chemotherapy alone is shown
in Figure 2.

Type of Chemotherapeutic Agents Used
The proportion of patients receiving specific chemotherapeutic agents also changed significantly during the study period (Fig. 3), rising from 16.7% to
75% and from 0% to 65.4% for carboplatin and taxane, respectively, and declining from 45% to 3.85%
and from 30% to 7% for etoposide and cisplatin,
respectively.

DISCUSSION
The decision to use chemotherapy is complex in the
face of uncertain benefit. Surveys reveal that individual physicians and types of specialists differ widely
in their beliefs regarding chemotherapy.20,21 Because
of the high risk of recurrence even in patients with
resected NSCLC, clinicians are motivated strongly to
add systemic therapy to surgery either preoperatively
or postoperatively even in patients with early-stage
disease.22,23 Some experts recommended adjuvant
chemotherapy for patients with resected NSCLC in
the absence of definitive data because of the great
risk of distant recurrence.22,23 Some patients prefer
aggressive treatment because of the perceived high
risk of recurrence.24
In a population-based sample of Medicare beneficiaries with resected stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC
between 1992 and 2002, we observed that 8.1%
of patients received perioperative chemotherapy.
The use of chemotherapy increased significantly in
patients who were diagnosed after 1994 relative to
patients who were diagnosed in 1992 after controlling for sociodemographic and treatment characteristics. Our findings are consistent with recent studies
of patterns of care in patients NSCLC conducted in
the U.S. and other countries.25–27 A noteworthy observation from our study was that chemotherapy use
initially increased and reached to its peak around

agents for resected stage II, IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer during the period
from 1992 to 2002.

1997/1998 for stage II, around 1999/2000 for stage
IIIA, and slowly declined afterward. Increased chemotherapy use in the 1990s corresponded temporally
with publication of the British Medical Council’s
meta-analysis, which demonstrated the moderate efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
resected NSCLC.7 The later decline in the use of
chemotherapy corresponded to the publication of
several randomized trials, which failed to demonstrate the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy,16,28 suggesting that community practice is sensitive to new
findings from clinical trials. However, some of those
trials were criticized for being underpowered for
detecting small benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in
this patient population.29
Chemotherapy use declined dramatically with
increasing age at diagnosis, consistent with previous
findings.30,31 This may be because of physicians’ perception of decreased chemotherapy tolerance or
increased risks of toxicity in elderly patients.30 Older
patients with lung cancer often are compromised by
the surgery itself and have a prolonged recovery time
compared with other cancer operations, such as
mastectomy and colectomy. This may interfere with
the receipt of chemotherapy. Elderly patients also
may be reluctant to trade quality of life for a perceived survival benefit31 and may be more likely to
refuse chemotherapy.32,33
We observed significant associations between
disease stage and the receipt of chemotherapy. For
patients with stage I disease, perioperative chemotherapy use was rare. This is in line with a recent
updated analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
trial, which failed to show a significant improvement
in overall survival in patients with stage IB NSCLC.11
For patients with stage II or IIIA disease, chemotherapy
use was greater and increased substantially by stage.

This is consistent with the results from clinical trials in
which increasing benefit was reported with advanced
stage.5,6
We observed that married patients received
chemotherapy more often, consistent with findings
in other cancers.34,35 The reasons underlying treatment differences by marital status are unclear but
may include encouragement or support from
patients’ spouses in seeking aggressive treatment36 or
the perception of a higher ‘‘value’’ of life in those
patients with a spouse and dependents.36 Clinicians
also may recommend aggressive therapies more often to married patients.
Patients who had a medical oncology referral
were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy
(adjusted OR, 5.63; 95% CI, 4.46–7.10). This is in
agreement with other studies, which demonstrated
that the decision to get a medical oncology referral is
a key step in the eventual receipt of chemotherapy.37–39
From 1992 to 2002, the combination of chemotherapeutic agents also changed. Our results suggest that carboplatin and paclitaxel came into wide
use as agents for patients with NSCLC in the U.S.
This shift occurred despite lack of definitive data on
the efficacy of these agents in the adjuvant setting.
Tolerance and toxicity of chemotherapy is a major
concern for elderly patient with lung cancer.40 Many
elderly patients with NSCLC have difficulty tolerating
cisplatin-based treatment because of its nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity; cisplatin administration requires aggressive hydration that may be
contraindicated in elderly patients because of their
comorbidities. Furthermore, cisplatin is also one of
the most emetogenetic drugs. The substitution of
carboplatin in elderly patients is appealing.22
Although carboplatin does not possess activity equivalent to that of cisplatin in all platinum-sensitive
tumors,41–43 carboplatin still may be an alternative to
cisplatin in elderly patients who are poor candidates
for cisplatin. With both activity and tolerability demonstrated in the treatment of advanced NSCLC,44,45
the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) also became a
popular option in the U.S.; with the increased use of
newer chemotherapeutic agents, the use of older
agents (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin)
dropped to a low rate.
The best sequence of surgery and chemotherapy
remains controversial. The majority of patients received chemotherapy postoperatively during the
study period. The advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy includes no delay of tumor resection and precise
pathologic staging. In addition, chemotherapy generally is more effective in treating minimal-volume dis-

ease compared with grossly apparent disease.29 The
advantages of using neoadjuvant chemotherapy
include earlier commencement of systemic therapy,
allowing for the surgical resection of tumor that may
not have been suitable for surgery at diagnosis. The
potential disadvantages of neoadjuvant therapy
include delaying potentially curative surgery and
increasing postoperative morbidity and mortality.29
The patients in the current analysis were aged
66 years. To our knowledge, there have been no
trials specifically assessing chemotherapy for NSCLC
in older patients. In a subgroup analysis of the
National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group study JBR.10, adjuvant vinorelbine and cisplatin improved survival in patients aged >65 years with
acceptable toxicity, even though elderly patients
received less chemotherapy.46 The results from a
meta-analysis of NSCLC7 indicated that the benefit
of adjuvant chemotherapy was independent of age.
We examined the association of chemotherapy with
survival from lung cancer in the SEER-Medicare data.
There are major challenges to assessing treatment outcomes in observational data, most of which
relate to selection biases. For example, a selection
bias may be expected for patients with better underlying health to be more likely to receive chemotherapy.47 In our analyses, we used multivariable survival
analyses and also controlled for propensity to treat.
We also stratified the analyses into deaths from cancer versus deaths from other causes. In our analyses,
patients with lung cancer who received chemotherapy experienced an approximate 33% lower mortality
from noncancer causes. This indicates that there
were strong residual selection biases that were not
eliminated after controlling for potential confounders
and propensity to receive chemotherapy. Consequently, the survival analyses lack validity, and we
did not present them.
The current study has several strengths. First, the
nationwide Medicare claims data offer a unique opportunity to study the use of adjuvant chemotherapy
in elderly patients with NSCLC. Compared with clinical trials data, which are known to underrepresent elderly patients, population studies are more likely to
represent all elderly patients in the real world. Second, this large, population-based study conducted in
community-dwelling elderly patients accounted for
14% of the U.S. population. The sample size was
large enough to allow us to draw conclusions regarding patterns of care in a diverse population and to
examine several potentially confounding variables.
Our study had some limitations. First, the study
findings may be applicable only to patients who
were diagnosed with NSCLC at age 66 years who

Chemotherapy for NSCLC in Elderly/Wang et al.

were not health maintenance organization members
and had both Medicare Part A and Part B coverage.
Chemotherapy use most likely was greater in patients
aged <65 years. Second, administrative databases
have inherent problems with data collection and
coding. Another limitation is that we were unable to
address the role of patients’ performance status in
perioperative chemotherapy use. Although the diagnoses included in Medicare claims data do allow for
an assessment of comorbidity, previous studies indicate that comorbidity may not be associated with
performance status.48,49
Our results demonstrated a trend toward the
increased use of chemotherapy and combined-modality therapy in elderly patients with resected
NSCLC during the decade from 1992 to 2002. The
most frequent use of chemotherapeutic agents also
changed. Our analysis assessed practice patterns that
existed before the publication of a large clinical trial
that confirmed the survival benefits of adjuvant
chemotherapy. Consequently, the proportion of
patients receiving chemotherapy today may be
higher. Better understanding of the biology of lung
cancer, the introduction of less toxic regimens, and
better supportive care are likely to impact treatment
patterns further in elderly patients with NSCLC. Our
findings may be used as a baseline against which the
benefit of new therapies can be compared.
