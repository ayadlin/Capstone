ABSTRACT
Background: The appropriate number of chemotherapy cycles for limited stage
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients without gross residual lesions after
complete resection, has not been specifically questioned. We performed a multicenter,
single-arm, phase 2 study to investigate the feasibility of 3 cycles of abbreviated R-CHOP
chemotherapy in low-risk patients with completely resected localized CD20+ DLBCL.
Results: Between December 2010 and May 2013, we recruited 23 patients. One
was excluded due to ineligibility, and hence, 22 were included in the final analysis. The
primary sites comprised the intestine (n = 15), cervical lymph nodes (n = 4), stomach
(n = 1), tonsil (n = 1), and spleen (n = 1). All patients successfully completed the 3
cycles of planned R-CHOP chemotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 39.5 months
(95% confidence interval, 29.9—47.1 months), both the estimated 2-year disease-free
survival and overall survival rates was 95% confidence interval, 85.9–104.1%. Only
one patient with an international prognostic index of 2 experienced relapse and
died. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity condition included neutropenia (n = 8,
36.4%). Three patients experienced grade 3 febrile neutropenia, but no grade 3 or 4
non-hematologic toxicity was observed.
Materials and Methods: DLBCL patients without residual lesions after resection
were enrolled and R-CHOP chemotherapy was repeated at 3-week-intervals over
3 cycles. The primary endpoint was 2-year disease-free survival.
Conclusions: Three cycles of abbreviated R-CHOP immunochemotherapy is
feasible for completely resected low risk localized DLBCL.

INTRODUCTION

(DLBCL). Using this combined treatment modality,
the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate has
been improved to up to 93% in certain LS DLBCL
patients [1]. Moreover, the British Columbia Cancer
Agency group showed that 3 cycles of abbreviated
R-CHOP chemotherapy, followed by an additional

cycle of chemotherapy, while omitting radiotherapy, can
achieve excellent outcomes in elderly patients with LS
DLBCL, who were found to achieve negative interim

F-fluorodeoxyglycose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET) [2].
In some cases, lymphomatous lesions are completely
resected during the diagnostic surgical procedure. In
addition, surgical resection of the lesions is often performed
in cases of gastrointestinal lymphomas with LS disease
due to the presence of obstructive lesions, uncontrolled
bleeding, or perforation risk. In these completely resected
patients, the subsequent chemotherapy aims to not treat the
macroscopic lesions but only eradicate any microscopic
disease if present. However, in these patients without gross
residual lesions, the adequate number of chemotherapy
cycles remains unexplored. Hence, full cycles of
chemotherapy are usually administered by following the
conventional treatment scheme in advanced stage disease.
Thus, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of a less
intensive therapeutic approach—a 3-cycle abbreviated
course of R-CHOP chemotherapy—in low-risk patients
with completely resected stage I or II CD20+ DLBCL.

day 45 and 49, after a 6-week interval, due to delayed
recovery from surgery. Three elderly patients received
dose-attenuated R-CHOP from the first cycle. Two of
these patients required another dose reduction by 25%
for cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin from the second
cycle due to the development of grade 4 neutropenia.
Another 4 patients required dose reduction for
cyclophosphamide and/or doxorubicin during treatment
due to the development of grade 4 neutropenia (n = 2) or
grade 3 febrile neutropenia (n = 2). None of the patients
required dose modification for rituximab, vincristine, or
steroids. Thus, the mean cumulative dose of each agent
is as follows: 1,125 mg/m2 for rituximab, 2,062.5 ±
311.6 mg/m2 for cyclophosphamide, 139.3 ± 20.2 mg/m2
for doxorubicin, 6 mg for vincristine, and 300 mg for
prednisolone. The cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin
doses correspond to 45.8% and 46.4% of those used
for 6 cycles of R-CHOP. All patients were confirmed as
having no evidence of disease via PET-CT after 3 cycles of
R-CHOP chemotherapy, except for 2 patients who refused
response evaluation. However, these 2 patients were
confirmed to be alive and well at the final survival data
update (July 2016).
Over a median follow-up duration of 39.5 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 29.9–47.1 months),
only 1 patient showed disease progression. This patient
was a 68-year-old man with non-GCB type disease; he
was the only patient with a preoperative IPI of 2 (aged
> 60 years and elevated LDH levels). He had 2 splenic
nodules and underwent splenectomy, followed by
3 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. Systemic disease
progression was confirmed at 12.3 months, and he died
due to rapid progressive disease after 2 weeks despite
salvage R-ESHAP chemotherapy. The estimated 2-year
DFS and OS rates were 95.0% (95% CI, 85.9–104.1%;
Figure 1). All of the 16 patients with gastrointestinal
tract involvement survived without disease progression
(Supplementary Materials, Supplementary Table 1, and
Supplementary Figure 1).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between December 2010 and May 2013, we
enrolled 23 patients. Of these, we included 22 patients
in the analysis excluding 1 patient with ineligibility. The
baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
preoperative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was
available for 11 patients, as the study procedures were
initiated after resection; It was elevated in 2 patients,
in whom the level was still above the reference range
after surgical resection. Thus, preoperative international
prognostic index (IPI) scores could be calculated in those
11 patients, and were found to be 0 in 8, 1 in 2, and 2 in
1 patient. Among the 11 patients for whom preoperative
LDH levels were not available, 8 were elderly without
other risk factors for IPI and 10 had at least 1 risk factor
of stage-modified IPI [3], either age (n = 8) or stage 2
disease (n = 2). The postoperative LDH levels of these
patients were within the reference range. One patient with
unknown IPI had CD5-positive DLBCL. According to
the cell of origin (COO) based on Han’s criteria [4], 10
patients were classified as having germinal-center B-cell
like (GCB)-DLBCL and the other 12 were classified as
having non-GCB DLBCL.

Toxicity
The toxicities are summarized in Table 2.
Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or 4
hematologic toxicity (36.4%). Three patients experienced
grade 3 febrile neutropenia, all of which developed after
the first cycle of R-CHOP chemotherapy. No grade 3 or 4
non-hematologic toxicities, including sensory neuropathy,
were observed. Moreover, no cardiac toxicity or treatmentrelated death occurred. Thus, 36.4% of patients experienced
grade 3 or 4 toxicities, which included neutropenia-related
adverse events. Four serious adverse events, including
abdominal pain and neutropenia in 2 patients and febrile
neutropenia in 2 patients, were reported. One patient was
positive for HBsAg with HBV-DNA level of 2,849 IU/mL.
The patient was given telbivudine as primary prophylaxis

Treatment and survival outcomes
All of the patients included in the analysis completed
the planned 3 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. The
median time from resection to chemotherapy was 24 days
(range, 9–49 days); 2 patients started chemotherapy on

DLBCL. Unlike cases of LS DLBCL treated with
combined modality, in which chemotherapy is the main
therapy and radiotherapy works as a consolidative
treatment, the patients in this trial were treated with surgical
resection followed by chemotherapy alone. In this surgicochemotherapeutic approach, surgical resection removes
the gross mass. Accordingly, the subsequent chemotherapy
only needs to eradicate the microscopic disease whichever

Our current findings suggest that 6 cycles of
chemotherapy may not be the gold standard for every

One on-study cardiac arrest
remains. Resected stage I Burkitt lymphoma can be
managed with a short course of chemotherapy after
surgical resection, even though it is the most aggressive
form of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [5, 6]. Hence, we
supposed that 3 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy, without
radiotherapy, might serve as an effective therapeutic
approach for completely resected LS DLBCL.
Our previous retrospective study that included 18
completely resected DLBCL patients treated with a short
course of chemotherapy also showed that none of the
patients experienced disease progression or relapse [7].
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center group
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recently reported that LS DLBCL can be successfully
managed irrespective of whether the therapeutic approach
involves short or long-course chemotherapy, with or
without radiotherapy [8]. In that study, 16 of 261 patients
were treated with 3–4 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy
without radiotherapy. Of these patients, 6 had fully
resected disease. Although the specific outcomes in those
resected patients were not illustrated separately, they
achieved excellent outcomes; a 5-year PFS rate of 93.8%
and 5-year OS rate of 100%.
We believe that a higher dose or a greater number
of cycles of chemotherapy does not always translate
13370

into better outcomes. Eight cycles of CHOP or R-CHOP
chemotherapy were previously used for the treatment
of aggressive lymphoma; the number of cycles was
reduced to 6 based on the findings of RICOVER-60,
which compared 6 and 8 cycles of biweekly CHOP with
or without rituximab [9]. Moreover, the risk-stratified
therapeutic approach does not simply mean more intensive
therapy for high-risk patients, but instead recommends
a reduced intensity of therapy in the lower risk group
to prevent attendant toxicities from overtreatment. The
British Columbia Cancer Agency PET-based treatment
algorithm recommends 4 cycles of chemotherapy in certain
patients who achieve complete response after 3 cycles
[10]. A similar risk-adapted therapeutic approach for LS
DLBCL is also currently under investigation in the SWOG
1001 trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01359592).
The DSHNHL-FLYER trial (NCT00278421) is an
ongoing study assessing the non-inferiority of 4 cycles of
R-CHOP, compared to 6 cycles, in low-risk LS DLBCL
patients with an age-adjusted IPI of 0. The data on the
exact threshold dose of chemotherapy for controlling
DLBCL are insufficient. Surprisingly, we found that 2
elderly patients in our trial received a cyclophosphamide
dose of only 1,312.5 mg/m2 and a doxorubicin dose of
only 87.5 mg/m2, which corresponds to 1.75 cycles of fulldose R-CHOP as they underwent a 25% dose reduction
from the first cycle, and the dose was further reduced to
a half dose from the second cycle. These patients were
disease-free and alive at the final follow-up.
Only 1 patient with primary splenic DLBCL
experienced disease progression. He was the only patient
with an IPI score of 2 and elevated LDH levels; in fact, his
stage-modified IPI score was also 2, which corresponds
to the intermediate risk group based on the LS DLBCL
classification [3]. Even though the SWOG 8736 trial
was conducted before the introduction of rituximab, the
5-year OS rates in patients with a stage-modified IPI of

2 was 60%, compared to the rates of 77% in those with 0
or 1 risk factor. The LDH level is a powerful prognostic
marker that has been considered a surrogate of disease
burden [11]. Furthermore, the patient exhibited not a
solitary lesion but 2 nodules in the spleen. According to
Han’s criteria, 12 patients (54.5%) developed non-GCB
type DLBCL, which is known to have a poor prognosis.
However, none of these patients, except for the primary
splenic case, experienced lymphoma relapse, which is
consistent with previous report on the insignificance of
COO in LS DLBCL treated with combined modality [8].
Surgical resection for aggressive lymphoma is
primarily used for diagnosis and for treatment in cases
of gastrointestinal lymphoma with pending perforation
or intractable bleeding. Thus, we did not intentionally
employ surgical resection for the treatment of localized
lymphoma, but only selected those patients for abbreviated
chemotherapy in this trial. However, some studies advocate
that surgical resection combined with chemotherapy can
help achieve better outcomes in patients with intestinal
DLBCL [12, 13]. In particular, patients with T1 to T3 or
N0 disease had significantly better OS, as compared to
those with T4 or N1 disease [14]. However, regardless
of LN metastases, depth of invasion (T1-3 vs. T4), or
COO, all the patients with intestinal DLBCL survived
without relapse until the last follow-up in the present study
(Supplenetary Materials). This excellent outcome might
be related to the patient selection, wherein only low-risk
gastointestinal lymphoma patients with IPI of 0 or 1 have
been selected. This finding suggests that certain low risk
gastrointestinal lymphoma patients may achieve excellent
survival without full-course R-CHOP chemotherapy.
Although R-CHOP is known to be a relatively
tolerable regimen, it is still associated with grade 3
or 4 neutropenia in up to 80% of patients and febrile
neutropenia in 20% of patients, as reported by recent
phase 2 or 3 clinical trials (Table 2) [1, 15–17]. However,

and OS rates were 95.0% (95% confidence interval, 85.89–104.11%).

the incidence of these adverse event rates was lower in the
present study, even without routine prophylactic G-CSF
administration. In fact, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was noted
in 8 patients (36.4%) and grade 3 febrile neutropenia was
noted in 3 (13.6%) patients; which can be understandably
expected with less cumulative dose intensity although
hematologic toxicities tend to occur more in the early
period of treatment.
Considering the favorable prognosis of LS DLBCL,
long-term morbidity and non-relapse mortality should
also be considered in the therapeutic decision. In the
SWOG 8736 trial, 17.9% of patients reported a second
malignancy after treatment and approximately 10% died
as a result of this malignancy [18]. Moreover, 14% of
patients in the GELA LNH-93 study died due to a second
malignancy. However, no cases of death due to second
malignancy were noted in our study, as expected, given the
low cumulative chemotherapy dose and the short followup period. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up is necessary.
In addition, cardiovascular disease is another long-term
toxicity to consider. In the SWOG 8736 trial, the incidence
of cardiovascular events was 16.5%, with a higher rate
of mortality in the chemotherapy alone arm (21.4% vs.
11.6%) [18]. The development of anthracycline-related
cardiotoxicity is well-known to be strongly correlated with
the cumulative dose [19]. Even though cardiotoxicity after
R-CHOP chemotherapy is not as common, as the cumulative
dose of doxorubicin is limited to 250 mg/m2 (well below
the usual recommended upper limit dose of 450–500
mg/ m2), 1–4% of patients were found to experience grade
3 cardiotoxicity, even in recent trials, as there is variable
sensitivity to anthracyclines among patients [15–17, 20].
The mean cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 139.3 ± 20.2
mg in the present study, which corresponds to 46.4% of the
full dose in the 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy.
The present study is a small-scale phase 2 trial, and
hence, the findings need to be cautiously interpreted. In
particular, this included a very small number of nodal
DLBCL cases. Nevertheless, it is well-known that stage
1 nodal DLBCL has better prognosis than extranodal
disease, including intestinal lymphoma, which has the
best prognosis among primary extranodal lymphomas
(median OS of nodal DLBCL vs. intestinal DLBCL: 180
vs. 159 months) [21]. Nevertheless, our findings should
be confirmed in a larger study even though the efficacy
outcome was excellent. Moreover, the median follow-up
duration was 39.5 months. This is not a short length of
follow-up, considering that patients achieving 2-year
EFS are known to have an OS equivalent to that of the
age- and sex-matched general population [22]. However,
the recently published long-term follow-up data of
SWOG 8736 showed that the continued risk of relapse
exists in LS DLBCL, unlike that with advanced stage
disease [18]. Accordingly, a longer follow-up duration
would more definitely indicate the actual prognosis in
these patients.

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective
clinical trial to suggest a reduced number of
immunochemotherapy cycles is feasible for completely
resected DLBCL. However, these findings should not
be generalized to all cases, including those with disease
at high-risk sites such as the testis, breast, orbit/nasal/
sinus region, or central nervous system, and patients with
bulky disease. Despite these limitations, we conclude that
3 cycles of abbreviated R-CHOP immunochemotherapy
might be effective and safe for patients with localized and
completely resected DLBCL, particularly among those
with low-risk IPI, which warrants further validation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
This prospective, single-arm, phase 2 trial was
conducted in 13 hospitals in Korea. Eligible patients
were aged ≥ 18 years, had newly diagnosed stage 1 or
2 CD20-positive DLBCL, and had undergone complete
resection of all lesions. Completely resected disease was
defined as the lack of any residual lymphoma on spiral CT
of the involved area after surgical resection, or confirmed
complete excision with negative resection margins on
pathologic examination after surgery in the case of stage I
disease with a single lesion on preoperative imaging study.
All the pathological results were reviewed by a dedicated
pathologist (J Huh), and the lesions were confirmed to be
de novo DLBCL as per the WHO classification [23]. Other
eligibility criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2 and adequate
hematologic and chemistry profiles. The exclusion
criteria included bulky disease; primary breast, testicular,
or central nervous system lymphomas; any previous
lymphoma treatment except for surgical resection; HIV
seropositivity; B symptoms; or any disorder that would
compromise the patient or the study, in the opinion of the
investigator. The study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board at each participating institute
and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01279902).

Procedures
Baseline assessments included complete blood
count, determination of the serum lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) levels, bone marrow aspiration and trephine
biopsy, CT scanning of the involved lesions and FDGPET. All these studies were performed before R-CHOP
chemotherapy and after the completion of 3 cycles
of immunochemotherapy; to monitor relapse, these
examinations, except for FDG-PET, were repeated at
3-month-intervals for 2 years, and at 6-month-intervals
for the next 3 years. R-CHOP chemotherapy was initiated
within 6 weeks from the surgical resection and was
repeated every 3 weeks over 3 cycles [24]. The upfront
13372

dose reduction of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by
25% was permitted if the patients were aged > 65 years,
at the discretion of investigators. Prophylactic G-CSF was
not routinely administered.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint was 2-year disease-free
survival (DFS), defined as the time from the date of surgical
resection to the first recording of relapse or death by any
cause. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS),
defined as the time from surgical resection to death or the
last follow-up, and safety. The treatment response was
assessed according to the International Working Group
response criteria [25]. Toxicity was evaluated before each
treatment cycle according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0.

Statistics
This study required the enrollment of 20 assessable
subjects in order to determine whether the 2-year DFS rate
is ≤ 70% (P0) or ≥ 90% (P1), with an alpha level of 0.05
and a power of 80% using a two-sided test. We assumed
that the drop-out rate would be 10%, and hence, a total
of 23 patients were required. All patients who received
any treatment in the study, except for those who were
ineligible, were included in the treatment evaluation,
safety, and efficacy analyses. The Kaplan–Meier method
was used to calculate the DFS and OS. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.
