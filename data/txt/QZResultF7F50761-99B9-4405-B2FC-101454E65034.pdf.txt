Abstract
Although speciﬁc mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) identify
tumors that are responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), these genetic alterations are present in only a
minority of patients. Patients with tumors expressing wild-type EGFR lack reliable predictive markers of their
clinical response to EGFR TKIs. Although epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been inversely correlated
with the response of cancers to EGFR-targeted therapy, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this
association have not been deﬁned and no speciﬁc EMT-associated biomarker of clinical beneﬁt has been
identiﬁed. Here, we show that during transforming growth factor b (TGFb)–mediated EMT, inhibition of the
microRNAs 200 (miR200) family results in upregulated expression of the mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), a
negative regulator of EGFR. The MIG6-mediated reduction of EGFR occurs concomitantly with a TGFb-induced
EMT-associated kinase switch of tumor cells to an AKT-activated EGFR-independent state. In a panel of 25 cancer
cell lines of different tissue origins, we ﬁnd that the ratio of the expression levels of MIG6 and miR200c is highly
correlated with EMT and resistance to erlotinib. Analyses of primary tumor xenografts of patient-derived lung and
pancreatic cancers carrying wild-type EGFR showed that the tumor MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio was inversely
correlated with response to erlotinib in vivo. Our data demonstrate that the TGFb–miR200–MIG6 network
orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and identify a low
ratio of MIG6 to miR200 as a promising predictive biomarker of the response of tumors to EGFR TKIs. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The sensitivity of some tumors to epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors can be explained by the presence of
mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (1, 2). However,
such mutations are rare in tumors other than non–small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC; refs. 3–6). There is a need to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the differential drug response of cancer
cells with wild-type EGFR to identify those patients who could
respond and clinically beneﬁt from tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI), and to develop new therapeutic strategies to circumvent
the de novo or acquired resistance of tumors to EGFR inhibitors.

The response to EGFR-targeted agents is inversely correlated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple types of tumors without known EGFR mutations,
including NSCLC, head and neck (H&N), bladder, colorectal,
pancreas, and breast carcinomas (7–11). Notably, epithelial
tumor cells have been shown to be signiﬁcantly more
sensitive to EGFR inhibitors than tumor cells, which have
undergone an EMT-like transition and acquired mesenchymal characteristics (11). These data suggest that EMT is a
common denominator of tumors that are resistant to EGFR
inhibitors. However, the precise molecular mechanisms
underlying this association have not been deﬁned and no
speciﬁc EMT-associated biomarker of clinical beneﬁt has
been identiﬁed.
EMT is driven by a network of transcriptional repressors,
which include SNAIL1, SNAIL2 (SLUG), ZEB1 (zinc-ﬁnger Ebox binding factor), ZEB2, and TWIST (12). Transforming
growth factor b (TGFb)–activated SMAD3/4 stimulates the
expression of SNAIL1 and TWIST1, which cooperate with
SMAD proteins to repress the expression of epithelial genes
such as CDH1 (which encodes E-cadherin; refs. 12, 13). These
transcriptional effects of TGFb cooperate with TGFBR2-mediated phosphorylation of partitioning defective 6 (PAR6) to
trigger EMT (12, 14). Whereas TGFb stimulates EMT, bone
morphogenetic protein signaling through SMAD1/4 induces

expression of proepithelial microRNAs (miRNA; miR200 and
miR205) that oppose EMT (12, 15). The miR200 family
consists of ﬁve members localized on two genomic clusters
that can be further divided into two subgroups according to
their seed sequences—subgroup I: miR141 and miR200a;
subgroup II: miR200b, miR200c, and miR429 (16). During
TGFb-induced EMT, miR200 family and miR205, but not the
other miRNAs, are greatly downregulated to facilitate this
transition (10, 16, 17).
Members of the miR200 family not only inhibit EMT, but also
inﬂuence sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors (10, 17–19). miR200c
may directly inhibit the expression of the mitogen-inducible
gene 6 (MIG6; also known as RALT, ERRFI1, or Gene 33; ref. 10),
a negative regulator of EGFR, which plays an important role in
signal attenuation of the EGFR network by blocking the
formation of the activating dimer interface through interaction
with the kinase domains of EGFR and ERBB2 (20–23). We
recently reported that EGFR activity was markedly decreased
during acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI erlotinib, with a
concomitant increase of MIG6 through the activation of the
PI3K–AKT pathway. A low MIG6/EGFR ratio was highly correlated with erlotinib sensitivity in a panel of cancer cell lines
and early passage xenografts of human tumors with wild-type
EGFR (24).
In this study, we report that in response to tumor cell–
autonomous expression of TGFb, erlotinib-sensitive tumor
cells undergo EMT-associated suppression of the miR200
family and subsequent upregulation of MIG6 expression. We
show that the MIG6-mediated reduction of EGFR occurs
concomitantly with a TGFb-induced EMT-associated kinase
switch of tumor cells to an AKT-activated state, thereby
leading to an EGFR-independent phenotype that is refractory
to EGFR TKI. In a panel of 25 cancer cell lines of different tissue
origins, we ﬁnd that the ratio of the expression levels of
MIG6 and miR200c is highly correlated with EMT and resistance to erlotinib. Moreover, analyses of primary tumor xenografts of patient-derived lung and pancreatic cancers carrying
wild-type EGFR showed that the tumor MIG6(mRNA)/miR200
ratio is inversely correlated with response to erlotinib in vivo.
Our data demonstrate that the TGFb–miR200–MIG6 network
orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that induces
resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and identify the ratio of MIG6
to miR200 as a promising predictive biomarker of the response
of tumors to EGFR TKIs.

HT-1376, BFTC-905, and J82), and the human H&N cell line
FaDu were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were freshly ordered and used within 6
months of order date.
Establishment of acquired resistance to erlotinib
Drug-resistant cell lines were generated via a process of
slowly escalating exposure to erlotinib, as reported previously
(24). SCC-S is used to designate the parental UM-SCC1 cells
exposed to DMSO, and SCC-R refers to the erlotinib-resistant
clone.
Antibodies and immunoblot analysis
Pelleted cells were lysed on ice with RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) supplemented with protease/phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method and lysates diluted in SDS sample buffer
(Bio-Rad) before SDS–PAGE. Anti-MIG6 antibody was a gift from
Dr. Ingvar Ferby of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,
Uppsala, Sweden (25). b-Actin was obtained from Abcam. All
other antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies were
from KPL and signals developed using West-Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc). ImageJ software was
used to quantify immunoblot signals on exposed ﬁlms.
Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
RNA was extracted using TRizol (Invitrogen) followed by
RNeasy kit cleanup (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed to
cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen), which was then used
as a template for real-time PCR. Gene products were ampliﬁed
using iTaq SYBR green Supermix with Rox dye (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). All reactions were performed in triplicate and
relative quantity was calculated after normalizing to GAPDH
expression.
Quantitative real-time PCR for miRNAs
RNA from cultured cells was extracted using the mirVana
Kit (Ambion). Total RNA from fresh-frozen tumors was
isolated using the TRizol reagent (Invitrogen). Speciﬁc quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays for miR200a, miR200b, miR200c, miR205, and
control RNU6b (Applied Biosystems) on a 7900HT detector
(Applied Biosystems).
Cell viability assay
Relative cell viability was determined using an Alamar Blue
assay as outlined by the manufacturer (AbDSerotec). New
media containing 1/10 volume of Alamar Blue reagent were
added to the wells and cells were incubated at 37 C for 1 hour.
Fluorescence (545-nm excitation, 590-nm emission wavelengths) was measured using a SpectraMax-Plus384 ﬂuorometer. Cell viability was calculated relative to an untreated
culture of cells incubated in parallel.
Measurement of TGFb in tumor cell supernatants
A total of 1  106 cells were plated in media containing 0.1%
FBS. Tumor cell supernatants were evaluated by ELISA (R&D

Systems) to determine the amount of TGFb expressed by 1 
106 cells per 24 hours.
Xenograft generation
The xenografts were generated and erlotinib treatment was
performed as published previously (26, 27). Relative tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) in response to erlotinib (35 mg/kg) was
calculated as the relative tumor growth of treated mice divided
by relative tumor growth of control mice (T/C). The animals
were maintained in accordance to guidelines of the American
Association of Laboratory Animal Care and the research
protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Use and Care Committee.
Statistical analysis
Student t tests were used for statistical analysis between two
groups. The signiﬁcance level was deﬁned as 0.05. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS. The IC50 value was
generated using GraphPad Prism software.

Results
The erlotinib-resistant tumor phenotype is associated
with a kinase switch that enables EGFR-independent
activation of AKT
To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the
resistance of tumor cells to EGFR TKI, we examined tumor
cell expression and activity of EGFR and alternative receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that lead to EGFR-independent
AKT activation. We evaluated pairs of cancer cell lines
with wild-type EGFR that were either sensitive or resistant
to the EGFR TKI, erlotinib; lung carcinoma (H358/H1703
and Calu3/Calu6) and H&N cancer (SCC-S/SCC-R and
JHU011/JHU028). Erlotinib-resistant (SCC-R) and erlotinib-sensitive (SCC-S) isogenic cell lines were generated by
chronic exposure of human H&N squamous cell carcinoma
UM-SCC1 cells to either erlotinib or DMSO (vehicle control;
ref. 24). The other three pairs of cell lines (JHU011/JHU028,
H358/H1703, and Calu3/Calu6) are intrinsically erlotinibsensitive or erlotinib-resistant. For every sensitive/resistant
cell line pair tested, the IC50 value of the resistant cells was
at least 10 times more than that of their sensitive counterparts (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the expression and activity of
EGFR family members in resistant and sensitive cell lines
revealed that the levels of phosphorylated EGFR, HER2, and
HER3 were markedly decreased in resistant cells (Fig. 1B).
In resistant cells, low activity of EGFR family kinases was
associated with a signiﬁcantly higher expression of the
endogenous EGFR family negative regulator, MIG6. Consistent with the observed upregulation of MIG6 expression by
PI3K-dependent pathways (24, 28), the resistant cell lines
exhibited higher AKT phosphorylation levels compared
with their sensitive counterparts (Fig. 1B). In accordance
with their increased AKT phosphorylation despite low
activity of the EGFR family members, erlotinib-resistant
cells exhibited a switch from EGFR to activation of an
alternative tumor cell–speciﬁc RTKs (PDGFR, FGFR,
VEGFR, and/or IGFR; Fig. 1C).

Increased production of TGFb induces an EMTassociated kinase switch that promotes erlotinib
resistance of tumor cells
The nonreceptor focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays an
important role in TGFb-induced EMT progression (29) and
upregulation of mesenchymal markers (30). We tested FAK
phosphorylation and total expression level in our four pairs of
erlotinib-resistant and -sensitive cell lines and found that FAK
activity is signiﬁcantly higher in erlotinib-resistant cells from
lung and H&N origin (Supplementary Fig. S1). To evaluate
whether resistance to erlotinib is associated with features of
EMT, we tested levels of E-cadherin and vimentin in the panel
of 25 erlotinib-sensitive or erlotinib-resistant cell lines with
wild-type EGFR from lung, H&N, and bladder cancer origin
(24). Although erlotinib-sensitive cells displayed characteristics
of typical epithelial cells, including expression of E-cadherin
and absence of vimentin, the majority of resistant cells displayed a mesenchymal phenotype manifested by loss of E-cadherin
and acquisition of vimentin (Fig. 2A). To determine whether
erlotinib sensitivity correlates with levels of tumor cell expression of TGFb (31), we measured the amount of TGFb produced
in cell supernatants of each of the 25 tumor cell lines. Erlotinibresistant, mesenchymal-like tumor cell lines produced higher
levels of TGFb compared with the erlotinib-sensitive, epitheliallike tumor cells (Fig. 2B). To examine whether TGFb induces
the EMT-associated kinase switch responsible for resistance to
erlotinib, erlotinib-sensitive epithelial cell lines were exposed to
TGFb1 or TGFb3. These cell lines included one H&N (SCC-S)
and two lung (H358 and H292) cancer cell lines. Serial examination of EMT markers (loss of E-cadherin and upregulation of
vimentin) in a time course (1–21 days) showed that TGFb
treatment resulted in complete EMT by day 14 (Fig. 2C and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). Strikingly, both total EGFR and
phospho-EGFR were reduced with this transition and were
accompanied by elevated expression of MIG6 in cells with a
mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Concomitant with these molecular alterations, the mesenchymal-like cells acquired a relative resistance to erlotinib (Fig. 2D
and Supplementary Fig. S2B). The acquisition of an erlotinibresistant EMT phenotype in response to TGFb was associated
with a signiﬁcant increase in AKT activity (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2A). To conﬁrm the causal role of AKT in
upregulating MIG6 in tumor cells that have acquired resistance
to erlotinib, we treated H358, H358/TGFb1-day 21, and H358/
TGFb3-day 21 cells with LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), U0126
(MEK inhibitor), or erlotinib (Fig. 2E). Whereas all three inhibitors reduced basal expression of MIG6 in H358 cells, only
LY294002 resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of MIG6 in the
erlotinib-resistant H358/TGFb1-day 21 and H358/TGFb3-day
21 cells. These data indicate that basal EGFR activity induces
an autoregulatory expression of MIG6 in epithelial cells, and
that TGFb-induced activation of AKT coopts this activity in
mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2E). Together with the data shown
in Fig. 1C, these data suggested that MIG6 elevation in EMT
cells is due to activation of AKT by EGFR-independent tyrosine
kinases. To test whether TGFb can promote this kinase switch,
levels of phospho IGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, and FAK kinases were
assessed in response to treatment of erlotinib-sensitive cells

kinases showed signiﬁcantly greater activity in TGFb1-treated cells when compared with the untreated counterparts
(Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data indicate
that TGFb-mediated activation of AKT via alternative
kinases may substitute for the loss of EGFR activity in a
cell-speciﬁc manner and contribute to the acquisition of an
erlotinib-resistant phenotype.
TGFb-induced EMT and erlotinib resistance is
associated with decreased levels of the miR200 family
and increased MIG6 expression
Because the miR200 family of miRNAs is downregulated to
facilitate EMT (10, 17), we used RT-PCR to assess the level of
expression of miR200 in three sensitive cell lines (SCC-S,
H358, and H292) in response to exposure to TGFb for 21
days. In all tested cell lines, expression of the miR200 family
members (200a, 200b, 200c, and 205) was signiﬁcantly
reduced upon TGFb treatment (Fig. 3A). Consistent with
the observed ability of miR200c to directly inhibit expression
of MIG6 (10), the loss of miR200 family in response to TGFb

was attended with elevation in MIG6 expression during
EMT-associated resistance to erlotinib (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2A). We next examined changes in miR200
levels in erlotinib-sensitive (SCC-S) and erlotinib-resistant
(SCC-R) isogenic H&N cell lines. We found that parental
erlotinib-sensitive SCC-S cells displayed signiﬁcantly higher
levels of miR200 family members than the resistant, mesenchymal like, SCC-R cells (Fig. 3B). The same pattern was
observed in the other three intrinsically sensitive/resistant
cell lines pairs (JHU011/JHU028, H358/H1703, and Calu3/
Calu6). Finally, examination of the 25 H&N, bladder, and
lung cancer cell lines used in this study demonstrated a
clear inverse correlation of miR200 levels and erlotinib
sensitivity (Fig. 3C). Notably, the levels of miR200 family
members were also inversely correlated with the expression
of MIG6. Although erlotinib-sensitive cells demonstrated a
high level of miR200 and a low level of MIG6, most of the
erlotinib-resistant cells showed decreased levels of miR200
miRNAs and elevated MIG6 expression (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together, these data indicate that
TGFb-induced repression of miR200 family unleashes the

The TGFb–miR200–MIG6 Pathway Induces Resistance to EGFR TKIs

Figure 2. Increased production of TGFb induces an EMT-associated kinase switch that promotes erlotinib resistance of tumor cells. A, protein lysates were
extracted from indicated cell lines with known sensitivity to erlotinib. Immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies against E-cadherin, vimentin,
and b-actin. B, tumor cell supernatants of 25 cancer cell lines shown in A were collected and differential levels of TGFb production were analyzed by ELISA. C,
the erlotinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line H358 was treated with TGFb1/TGFb3 (4 ng/mL) or control vehicle for 21 days. Cells were collected at different
time points and immunoblot analysis was performed with indicated antibodies. D, parental and TGFb-induced H358 cells were treated with erlotinib
for 72 hours at indicated time points and cell viability was assayed. E, cells treated with TGFb1/TGFb3 or control vehicle for 21 day were exposed to LY294002,
U0126, or erlotinib for 24 hours. Immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies against MIG6 and b-actin. F, protein lysates were extracted from

expression of MIG6 in tumor cells during their EMT-associated conversion to an erlotinib-resistant phenotype.
Inhibition of TGFb signaling results in upregulation of
miR200c and miR205, decrease in MIG6 levels, and
increased erlotinib sensitivity
Autocrine or paracrine TGFb signaling is required for the
maintenance of the mesenchymal state. Blockage of this
signaling can inhibit or reverse EMT by upregulating miR200
and subsequently downregulating ZEB1/2 (31–34). As a corollary to this observation, overexpression of miR200c restores
the sensitivity of resistant NSCLC cells to the anti-EGFR
antibody cetuximab (35). To determine whether inhibition of
TGFb can restore miR200 expression and reverse the erlotinibresistant phenotype, we blocked TGFb signaling in two erlotinib-resistant cell lines of lung (H1703) and H&N (JHU028)
origin with SB-431542, a potent inhibitor of the activin receptor–like kinase (ALK) receptors family. Tumor cells were

cultured with TGFb alone or in combination with TGFb
inhibitor for 7 days, and then treated with 1 mmol/L erlotinib
for an additional 72 hours. In both cell lines, exposure to TGFb
inhibitor resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in miR200c and
miR205 levels, and concurrent downregulation of AKT phosphorylation and MIG6 expression (Fig. 4A and B). Treatment
with SB-431542 increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to
erlotinib (Fig. 4C). Likewise, cells incubated with TGFb RII/
Fc (recombinant TGFb receptor II, which binds to and inhibits
TGFb1, TGFb3, and TGFb5), displayed a similar increase in
erlotinib sensitivity (Fig. 4C).
The elevated ratio of MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 expression is
associated with erlotinib resistance in cancer cell lines of
different tissue origins
We observed a strong correlation between MIG6 mRNA and
protein levels in 25 tumor cell lines (Fig. 5A). Akin to the MIG6
protein (24), MIG6 mRNA expression was considerably lower in

Figure 3. TGFb-induced EMT and erlotinib resistance is associated with decreased levels of the miR200 family and increased MIG6 expression. A, erlotinibsensitive cell lines H358, H292, and SCC-S were exposed to TGFb for 21 days. RNA was extracted and expression levels of miR200a, miR200b, miR200c,
and miR205 were quantiﬁed by real-time PCR. B, RNA was extracted from four sensitive/resistant cancer cell lines pairs. Levels of miR200a, miR200b,

erlotinib-sensitive cell lines. Next, we tested whether the ratio
between MIG6 mRNA and miR200 levels is a reliable predictor
of tumor cells response to erlotinib. We found that across the
panel of 25 cancer cell lines, the ratio of MIG6 mRNA to each
one of the miR200 family members tested seemed to be a
reliable predictor of tumor cell responsiveness to erlotinib (Fig.
5B and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Given the strong correlation
between MIG6 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5A), the ability of
MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratios to predict erlotinib sensitivity
was equal to the predictive value of the MIG6/miR200 protein
expression ratio (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the ability of the
MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio to predict erlotinib sensitivity in
cancer cell lines was even better than the predictive value of the
MIG6/EGFR protein expression ratio (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
The MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio predicts response to
erlotinib in directly xenografted primary human lung
and pancreatic tumors
We obtained 18 human NSCLCs, and 27 pancreatic tumors
that were directly xenografted into nude mice (27). Tumor
characteristics, including KRAS, NRAS, and p53 mutation sta-

tus, are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. No erlotinibsensitizing mutations in EGFR were detected in any of these
tumors and there was no correlation of KRAS mutation with
erlotinib response. For all models tested, miR200 levels were
measured by quantitative RT-PCR and mRNA levels of MIG6
and EGFR were determined by Affymetrix expression array.
Relative TGI in response to erlotinib (35 mg/kg) was calculated
as the relative tumor growth of treated mice divided by relative
tumor growth of control mice. We next plotted the
MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio against erlotinib responsiveness,
with the more resistant tumors clustered to the left and the
more sensitive models clustered on the right. Lung and pancreatic tumors that display a high MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio
tended to cluster on the left side of the chart, indicating
that they were more resistant to erlotinib (Fig. 6A and B).
Lung models with a TGI more than 40% and pancreatic models
with TGI greater than 50%, were associated with signiﬁcantly
lower MIG6(mRNA)/miR200a, MIG6(mRNA)/miR200b, or
MIG6(mRNA)/miR200c ratios and greater miR200 expression
(Fig. 6). Our data showed that expression of miR200c (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and subsequently the MIG6(mRNA)/
miR200c ratio (Fig. 6) showed the strongest correlation with

Two erlotinibresistant cell lines (JHU028 and H1703) were treated with TGFb (2 ng/mL) alone or in combination with SB-431542 (10 mmol/L) for 7 days. A, cell lysates were
collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis with indicated antibodies. B, levels of miR200c and miR205 were measured and relative expression is
presented as DDCt. C, cells were incubated with TGFb (2 ng/mL) alone or in combination with either SB-431542 (10 mmol/L) or TGFb-RII/Fc (20 ng/mL)
for 7 days and then were treated with 1 mmol/L of erlotinib for an additional 72 hours. Cell viability was assayed and values were set at 100% for
untreated controls.

erlotinib response compared with miR200b and miR200a,
suggesting that miR200c might play a more dominant role in
regulating MIG6. Supporting this observation, an inverse correlation between miR200c and MIG6 expression levels was
noted across the pancreatic models (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
In lung models, tumors with higher erlotinib sensitivity displayed a similar pattern of the low MIG6(mRNA)/miR200c
ratio. Of note, four erlotinib-resistant lung tumors with low
EGFR and MIG6 expression (CTG-0167, CTG-0502, CTG-0199,
and CTG-0157; Supplementary Fig. S5C) exhibited even lower
levels of miR200c (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Unlike the limited
predictive ability of the MIG6/EGFR ratio in such tumors with
low EGFR expression (24, 27), the MIG6(mRNA)/miR200c ratio
was still able to correctly identify three of four of these lung
tumors with low EGFR mRNA as erlotinib resistant. Therefore,
the ratio of MIG6 to miR200 was a reliable predictive biomarker
of the primary tumors response to EGFR TKIs regardless of
their EGFR status.

Discussion
TGFb, a multifunctional cytokine that regulates cell growth
and differentiation, is frequently upregulated in many human
cancers (31, 36–38). Although TGFb exerts a suppressive effect
on normal epithelial cells, tumor cells frequently become
refractory to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGFb and acquire
an ability to increase expression and secretion of TGFb (31–
34). This switch enables tumor cells to leverage the tumorpromoting effects of TGFb in the tumor microenvironment to
facilitate tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis (31–39).
Previous studies have demonstrated that TGFb plays a key role
in promoting EMT, a switch of epithelial cells into a mesenchymal migratory phenotype that is driven by a network of
transcriptional repressors that include SNAIL1, ZEB1, ZEB2,
and TWIST (12, 39, 40). TGFb uses both, canonical and
noncanonical signaling pathways to engineer this kinase
switch. TGFb-activated SMAD3/4 stimulates the expression
of SNAIL1 and TWIST1, which repress the expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

epithelial genes, such as CDH1 (which encodes E-cadherin;
ref. 13). TGFb also inhibits the expression of proepithelial
miRNAs (miR200 and miR205) that inhibit ZEB1/2 and oppose
EMT (17, 18, 32, 41). Besides promoting EMT, TGFb engages
SMAD-independent pathways to activate PI3K–AKT, such as
tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE)-mediated secretion of EGFR ligands (42).
In this study, we report that TGFb induces tumor cells to
undergo an EMT-associated kinase switch that renders them
resistant to EGFR inhibitors. TGFb-mediated suppression of
the miR200 family not only facilitates EMT, but also enables
upregulation of MIG6, a negative regulator of EGFR whose
expression is held in check by miR200c. In addition to curtailing EGFR activity via upregulation of MIG6, TGFb promotes
EGFR-independent activation of alternative RTKs and PI3K–
AKT signaling. We ﬁnd that the net effect of TGFb signaling is
the loss of EGFR activity with a concomitant EMT-associated
kinase switch of tumor cells to an AKT-activated state, thereby
leading to an EGFR-independent mesenchymal phenotype that
is refractory to EGFR TKI. Our study demonstrates that the
molecular signature of this resistant tumor phenotype is an
elevated MIG6/miR200 ratio.
Our data demonstrate that the TGFb–miR200–MIG6 network orchestrates the EMT-associated kinase switch that
induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors (Fig. 7). As such, the
autonomous production of TGFb by tumor cells may be a
frequent mechanism by which cancers induce an erlotinibresistant phenotype. Our study provides the following lines of
evidence to support this conclusion. In a panel of 25 cancer cell
lines of different tissue origins (H&N, bladder, and lung),
erlotinib-resistant, mesenchymal-like cells produced higher
levels of TGFb than the epithelial-like, erlotinib-sensitive cells,
suggesting that increased autocrine exposure to TGFb may be
a driving force behind the erlotinib-resistant phenotype. In the
same panel, resistance to erlotinib was highly correlated with
EMT and an elevated MIG6/miR200c ratio. Besides the high
TGFb expression and elevated MIG6/miR200 ratio exhibited by

The TGFb–miR200–MIG6 Pathway Induces Resistance to EGFR TKIs

Figure 6. The MIG6(mRNA)/miR200 ratio predicts response to erlotinib in directly xenografted primary human lung and pancreatic tumors. RNA was extracted
from 18 human NSCLCs (A) and 27 pancreatic directly xenografted low passage tumors (B). Levels of miR200 family members were measured by quantitative
RT-PCR and mRNA levels of MIG6 were determined by Affymetrix expression array. The ratios of MIG6(mRNA)/miR200a, MIG6(mRNA)/miR200b, and
MIG6(mRNA)/miR200c were plotted against erlotinib responsiveness, with the more resistant tumors clustered to the left and the more sensitive models
clustered on the right.

de novo erlotinib-resistant cell lines, this phenotype was also
exhibited by SCC-R tumor cells that had acquired erlotinib
resistance by culturing erlotinib-sensitive SCC-S cells in the
presence of escalating concentrations of erlotinib. SCC-R cells
expressed more than 10-fold higher levels of TGFb compared
with SCC-S cells (31), and this was associated with reduction of
miR200 family members (200a, 200b, 200c, and 205) and
concomitant increase in MIG6 expression. Furthermore, these
cells showed evidence of EMT and manifested a kinase switch
involving reduced activity of the EGFR kinase family and
activation of alternative RTKs (pPDGFR, pFGFR, pVEGFR, and
pIGFR) and AKT. In support of the causal association of tumor
cell expression of TGFb with an elevated MIG6/miR200 ratio
and erlotinib resistance, exposure of various erlotinib-sensitive
epithelial tumor cells to exogenous TGFb resulted in their
EMT-associated conversion to an erlotinib-resistant phenotype with an attendant reduction of miR200, increase in MIG6
expression, decrease in EGFR activity, and activation of AKT.
Conversely, blockade of TGFb signaling in erlotinib-resistant,
mesenchymal-like cell lines resulted in a concurrent increase
of miR200c and miR205 transcripts, downregulation of AKT

activity and MIG6 levels, and a signiﬁcant increase in erlotinib
sensitivity.
The 25 H&N, bladder, and lung cancer cell lines used in this
study showed an inverse correlation between the expression
levels of MIG6 and miR200. Whereas erlotinib-sensitive cells
displayed a low MIG6/miR200 ratio, erlotinib-resistant cells
exhibited a high MIG6/miR200 ratio. A similar pattern was
noted during TGFb-induced EMT, wherein downregulation of
miR200 family members was paralleled by upregulation of
MIG6. By performing PicTar, TargetScan, miRanda, and miRBase searches to predict miRNA–mRNA interactions on the
MIG6 30 untranslated region (UTR), we found that the 30 UTR of
MIG6 contains conserved potential binding sites for miR200
family members. In addition, recent work indicates that
miR200c can directly bind to the 30 UTR region of MIG6 mRNA
and downregulate its expression (10). In line with these data,
the MIG6(mRNA)/miR200c ratio showed the strongest association with erlotinib sensitivity in cancer cell lines as well as
primary human tumor xenografts in vivo. These data suggest
that TGFb-mediated suppression of the miR200 family
unleashes expression of MIG6, which in turn quenches EGFR

responsible for resistance to EGFR TKI. Consistent with these
observations, our analyses of patient-derived primary tumor
xenografts of 18 NSCLC and 27 pancreatic cancers carrying
wild-type EGFR showed that the tumor MIG6/miR200 ratio is
inversely correlated with response to erlotinib in vivo.
Our study demonstrates that an elevated MIG6/miR200
ratio is a molecular signature that characterizes the erlotinib-resistant tumor phenotype. These observations have
important clinical implications for the treatment of patients
with EGFR inhibitors. The tumor MIG6/miR200 ratio may have
clinical value as a predictive biomarker to discern patients who
are likely to beneﬁt from EGFR inhibitors from those who are
unlikely to respond to such therapy. Our ﬁndings further
suggest that inhibition of the molecular determinants of the
EMT-associated kinase switch, such as TGFb, may prevent or
reverse the de novo or acquired resistance of cancers to EGFR
inhibitors.

activity. The elevation of MIG6 following TGFb-induced EMT
is sustained by EGFR-independent activation of AKT because
this is reduced by PI3K inhibitors, but not by erlotinib. Therefore, a high MIG6/miR200c ratio is a sequel of TGFb-induced
EMT and a signature of the EMT-associated kinase switch
