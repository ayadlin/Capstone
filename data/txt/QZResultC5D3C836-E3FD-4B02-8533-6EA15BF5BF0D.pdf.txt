Abstract
Cancer continues to be a major cause of mortality despite decades of effort and expense. The problem
reviewed here is that before many cancers are discovered they have already progressed to become drug
resistant or metastatic. Biomarkers found in blood or other body fluids could supplement current clinical
indicators to permit earlier detection and thereby reduce cancer mortality. Cancer Res; 70(13); 5203–6. ©2010 AACR.

The Need for Earlier Detection of Cancer
Progress against cancer has been slow despite decades of
effort. Since 1990 the death rate for all cancers combined has
decreased by only 1% per year, a decline due to a combination of factors including reductions in tobacco use, improvements in treatment of specific cancers, and successful early
detection of a few specific cancers (1). New treatments for
leukemia, lymphomas, and testicular cancer have reduced
death rates for these cancers, but no magic bullet has
emerged. Current anticancer drugs have limited efficacy
against advanced cancers. Drugs and surgery can be effective
against early tumors, but they usually only briefly extend survival of patients with metastatic cancer. For example, survival for breast cancer patients with early localized disease is
98% as compared with a dismal 27% for those whose cancer
has already progressed to distant metastasis at initial diagnosis (2). Although efforts to develop efficacious therapeutics
continue, the other side of the coin is the need for improved
methods to detect cancers earlier.
Early detection can significantly reduce cancer mortality.
Death rates from some major cancers have declined recently
because of early detection. In particular, Papanicolau test
screening detects and allows removal of presymptomatic cervical cancers and has saved many lives. There have also been
partial successes in early detection screening programs for
breast, colon, and prostate cancers. Mammography detects
80 to 90% of breast cancers and has reduced risk of death
by 15% in all women screened. Unfortunately, mammography
also generates a high rate of false positives and detects inAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Bioarray Therapeutics Inc., Belmont,

dolent localized cancers that may not require treatment (3).
The effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy for people 50 years of age or above reduces incidence as well as mortality, though screening rates remain
low (1). Recent declines in prostate cancer deaths were
attributed to early detection by prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), however, there are still questions about death reduction and overdiagnosis rates (1). Less successful programs
do not negate the value of early detection screening. It remains a challenge to researchers to develop screens that
overcome current problems and efficiently detect treatable
early cancers.
Here we provide an overview of the current state of development of body-fluid biomarkers for cancer detection.
Although body-fluid biomarkers have been studied and applied for many years, exciting new discoveries are supported
by recent advances in bioinformatics, bioengineering, and
high-throughput genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics
technologies.

Body Fluid Biomarkers for Early Detection
Fluid sampling has advantages over imaging as it is widely
accepted, readily repeated, convenient, noninvasive, and low
cost. Biomarkers in body fluids have the potential to detect
a wide variety of primary tumors and metastases located
throughout the body. Fluid biomarkers include a variety of
components in blood, urine, or other fluids that reflect the
presence of a tumor in the body. These include circulating
tumor cells (CTC) and macromolecules such as lipids, proteins, RNA, microRNA, and DNA that originate from tumor
cells (Fig. 1). In addition to CTCs, other circulating cells being explored include immune, stromal, and endothelial cells.
It is particularly exciting that a combination of biomarkers
can be more effective than a single biomarker by decreasing
false positives and increasing detection of multiple tumor
subtypes. Several sources of body fluids can yield biomarkers
as described below.
Blood-based mRNA gene signatures
Blood is an excellent fluid in which to find biomarkers. A
paradigm for blood biomarkers is the PSA protein test

for prostate cancer. In addition to proteins, mRNAs are
promising biomarkers, and microarrays represent a powerful
approach for their discovery in blood. A study using customspotted arrays published in 2001 identified a signature of 12
genes whose mRNA expression was elevated in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of breast cancer patients
(4). Conclusions were limited by low numbers of genes
and samples tested. More recent microarray studies have
identified additional early detection signatures. A study of
PBMCs from lung cancer patients identified a signature of
29 genes that distinguished patients from controls (5). A
study of sorted peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients
with melanoma and healthy controls identified 17 interferonstimulated genes that distinguished the groups; findings
were confirmed by PCR and functional tests (6). Panels of
mRNA biomarkers for early detection have also been identified in bladder, breast, and renal carcinomas (7–9). These
studies suggest that blood-based mRNA signatures may be
potentially useful for early detection screening of multiple
solid tumor types.
Shortcomings of blood mRNA signature studies are notable. It is often not clear if signals originate from tumor cells
or PBMCs. Immune cell responses could lead to false positives. Only small scale studies have been done to date and

clinical translation will require studies involving larger number of patients.
Circulating tumor cells
CTCs are indicators of cancer and have been extensively
reviewed (10, 11). CTC applications are currently limited to
following progression and therapy response in patients with
metastatic cancer in which five or more CTCs per 7.5 ml
blood are associated with disease progression. Several issues
must be addressed to allow the application of CTC technology to the early detection of cancer. One challenge is to
find highly specific markers able to address a very low signalto-noise ratio. CTC detection currently relies on a single
marker, the epithelial cell surface epitope EpCAM. Although
EpCAM is an excellent epithelial cell marker, it is not expressed on all cancer cells (11). Emerging approaches include
the use of gene mutations, antibody cocktails, negative selections, and filtrations on the basis of cell size or density (10).
Additional studies will determine if CTC counting is applicable to early cancer detection.
Circulating cell-free nucleic acids
The detection of cell-free nucleic acids (RNA and DNA)
originating from tumor cells and circulating in serum or

Biomarkers for Cancer Early Detection in Body Fluids

plasma of cancer patients was first reported decades ago
(12, 13) and has been verified for a variety of tumor types.
The presence of circulating DNAs harboring somatic mutations in growth factor receptors, tumor suppressor genes,
and oncogenes has been used as tumor-specific serum biomarkers for cancer cells (13). Recently, Schmidt and colleagues
detected mutant DNA in the blood of approximately 50% of
patients with early stage colorectal cancer (14).
Preliminary evidence has shown that RNAs are more readily detected in plasma than in the cellular fraction that would
contain intact CTCs. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis
of the prostate marker KB208E9 mRNA showed a six fold
higher level in the plasma than in the buffy coat fraction.4
Further, serum levels of microRNA-141 distinguished
patients with prostate cancer from healthy controls (15). At
least four microRNAs (miR-21, miR-210, miR-155, and miR196a) have been found in plasma and pancreatic cancer
tissues but not in healthy controls. Epigenetic modifications
including specific DNA methylation changes are increasingly recognized as important in cancer progression and
these can also be found in free DNA circulating in cancer
patient blood (16).
The clinical value of nucleic acid detection in plasma or
serum for early detection has been extensively assessed but
results are still inconsistent (17). A limitation is a high rate of
false negatives. Although positive results are found in patients with cancer, the absence of circulating nucleic acid
does not correlate with the absence of cancer.
Other approaches
Other fluids have been used for early cancer detection. For
example, KB208E9 mRNA and other prostate biomarkers are
elevated in urine of prostate cancer patients (18) and shown
to distinguish metastatic from localized prostate cancer.
Saliva has been used to detect oral and breast cancers (19).
Hundreds of metabolites have been found in urine, plasma,
and tissue specimens of prostate cancer patients. Other
promising early detection biomarkers exploit the tumor
microenvironment and angiogenic switch by quantifying
urinary metalloproteinases and analyzing the platelet
angiogenic proteome (20). Circulating endothelial cells and
stromal stem cells are also potential future biomarkers for
early cancer screening.

Goals of Future Basic Biomarker Research
In this era of highly innovative molecular technologies in
the research laboratory, there is a critical need to efficiently
translate tests to the clinic. Thousands of articles on biomarkers have been published in the past decade, but few are
applied clinically. Recently, a report of a set of promising
biomarkers for serum-based detection of ovarian cancer recommended inappropriate clinical applications because of
the use of flawed biostatistics (21). Several other promising
biomarkers have not been validated in large scale clinical

studies. For screening of the general population, the costs
of false positives and false negatives are major criteria and
minimum acceptable rates can vary depending on the cancer
type. For instance, lower false positive rates are acceptable
for cancers that require more invasive follow up (e.g., ovarian
cancer). There is no formula for selecting successful biomarkers to date, but this should include hypothesis-driven
experimental design, robust statistical analysis, representative patient selection, and validation in independent data
sets early in biomarker development. Guidelines have been
developed for both reporting of results (REMARK) and
phases of biomarker development [Early Detection Research
Network (EDRN)].
Fluid-based early detection research brings several questions: How early can a cancer be detected by biomarkers?
And is the earliest detection of a malignancy always valuable? Some tumors are indolent and never become invasive
or life threatening (20), whereas others progress rapidly.
Methods to distinguish indolent and aggressive cancers are
research topics, but few clinical tests are currently available.
Mammaprint and OncoTypeDX gene expression signatures
are prototype tests that are applied to breast tumor tissue
to identify patients likely to have a good outcome without
treatment. However, until there is more experience with
and reliance on similar tests, early detection poses the risk
of overtreatment. A “watch and wait” approach can be
recommended for prostate patients with positive PSA tests
and localized cancer, but often patients prefer treatment.
The successful implementation of early detection programs
will ideally require the codevelopment of tests to distinguish
aggressive from indolent tumors.
A further question is posed: What response is appropriate
in the situation of a positive body fluid test when the tumor
cannot be clinically diagnosed? Experience with the new
detection tests will be required to know if systemic treatment
is warranted. Small steps will be necessary to validate body
fluid biomarkers. For instance, fluid biomarkers could be initially introduced as complimentary tests to confirm positive
results from conventional screening methods, and to aid in
deciding further treatments.
As with all screening programs, the measure of success
will be nothing less than reducing cancer-specific mortality.
Determining whether a program is effective could require
large (i.e., multithousand patient) clinical trials lasting many
years and requiring great expense. Clinical translation is vastly more expensive than basic research. But it is necessary, as
is validation of a new drug. Unfortunately, it is much less
likely that industry will fund early detection biomarker tests
than highly profitable drug development programs.
Given the great expense of clinical trials, it will also be important that the right biomarker sets are taken into clinical
trials. Biomarkers are needed for routine early detection
screening for all types of cancers. It may be most appropriate
if initial trials address frequently lethal cancers for which
there are large amounts of data and resources. Archived
blood samples with clinical outcome data can be used to test
proposed biomarker sets before proceeding to prospective
sampling of patients.

Methods developed for finding and applying fluid biomarkers for one type of cancer will likely be applicable to
other cancer types. In particular, cancers such as pancreatic
and ovarian are often discovered too late for effective therapy. It remains to be seen if early detection of these aggressive
tumor types will impact mortality rates. In addition to early
detection applications, the same fluid biomarker tests would
likely also have applications to monitoring therapy response
and disease outcome. Improvements in selection of effective
therapeutic drugs and surgical procedures could be developed from results.

Conclusions
The application of fluid biomarkers for the early detection of
cancers of all types is of significant potential value and deserves
a similarly significant share of funding. Roughly 1,000 commercial genetic tests are being developed for medical problems
including cancer, but very few biomarker tests are currently
applied (22). Although fluid-based biomarkers seem promising,

their reliability has not been determined. Assay sensitivity
and specificity need to be improved, techniques must be
standardized and validated, and biomarkers are not yet
closely legally regulated. Pressing financial, political, and
cultural issues have the potential to derail anticipated
benefits (23).
What directions will cancer research take? We can be confident that general progress and remarkable new discoveries
will continue. Techniques for earlier detection are beginning
to be developed and could have major impacts. Clinical progress depends on testing novel ideas. Paraphrasing the late
Dr. Judah Folkman, “There are only experts on the past, none
on the future”.
