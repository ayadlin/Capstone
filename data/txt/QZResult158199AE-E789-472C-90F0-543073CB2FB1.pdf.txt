Abstract
Nuclear expression of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 is
a biomarker of increased invasiveness in cholangiocarcinoma, a
primary liver cancer with scarce treatment opportunities and
dismal prognosis. In this study, we provide evidence that targeting
S100A4 nuclear import by low-dose paclitaxel, a microtubulestabilizing agent, inhibits cholangiocarcinoma invasiveness
and metastatic spread. Administration of low-dose paclitaxel
to established (EGI-1) and primary (CCA-TV3) cholangiocarcinoma cell lines expressing nuclear S100A4 triggered a marked
reduction in nuclear expression of S100A4 without modifying
its cytoplasmic levels, an effect associated with a signiﬁcant
decrease in cell migration and invasiveness. While low-dose
paclitaxel did not affect cellular proliferation, apoptosis, or
cytoskeletal integrity, it signiﬁcantly reduced SUMOylation of
S100A4, a critical posttranslational modiﬁcation that directs its

trafﬁcking to the nucleus. This effect of low-dose paclitaxel was
reproduced by ginkolic acid, a speciﬁc SUMOylation inhibitor.
Downregulation of nuclear S100A4 by low-dose paclitaxel was
associated with a strong reduction in RhoA and Cdc42 GTPase
activity, MT1-MMP expression, and MMP-9 secretion. In an
SCID mouse xenograft model, low-dose metronomic paclitaxel
treatment decreased lung dissemination of EGI-1 cells without
signiﬁcantly affecting their local tumor growth. In the tumor
mass, nuclear S100A4 expression by cholangiocarcinoma cells
was signiﬁcantly reduced, whereas rates of proliferation and
apoptosis were unchanged. Overall, our ﬁndings highlight
nuclear S100A4 as a candidate therapeutic target in cholangiocarcinoma and establish a mechanistic rationale for the use of
low-dose paclitaxel in blocking metastatic progression of cholangiocarcinoma. Cancer Res; 76(16); 4775–84. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

decades (1, 2), but, unfortunately, the prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma has not changed, with less than 5% of patients surviving up to 5 years from diagnosis (1). At the time of diagnosis,
less than 30% of patients are eligible for surgical resection or liver
transplantation, the only potentially curative strategies. Thus, in
70% of patients, the stage is advanced, because of the tumor
invasiveness and early extrahepatic dissemination. Furthermore,
success of curative treatments is hindered by the high rate of
recurrence, with a 5-year survival after resection around 20%–
40% (3). Combined cisplatin and gemcitabine therapy, the current standard of care for advanced cholangiocarcinoma, increases
the patient's overall survival by less than 4 months with respect to
gemcitabine alone (4). The lack of effective treatments reﬂects the
deep gap in knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying
cholangiocarcinoma invasiveness. Better understanding of these
mechanisms is needed to predict the invasiveness of the individual tumor and to devise molecular-targeted therapy (5).
Among the biomarkers of increased tumor invasiveness,
S100A4 has drawn particular attention in the past few years.
S100A4, a low molecular weight, cytoskeleton-associated calcium-binding protein, is normally expressed by mesenchymal
(mostly ﬁbroblasts and macrophages), but not by epithelial
cells. S100A4 may handle different functions depending upon
its subcellular localization. When localized in the cytoplasm, it
may interact with cytoskeleton and plasma membrane proteins
(including actin, non-muscle myosin-IIA and -IIB, p53, liprin-b1,

Cholangiocarcinoma, a malignancy arising from either the
intrahepatic or the extrahepatic bile ducts, still carries a severe
prognosis. Cholangiocarcinoma is responsible for the 10%–20%
of deaths related to primary liver tumors (1). In the Western
countries, its incidence has been steadily increasing in the past

methionine aminopeptidase-2; ref. 6), thereby contributing to the
regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, as well as
cell reshaping and cytoskeletal rearrangement. When translocated
to the nucleus, S100A4 may act as a transcription factor for several
genes, including those encoding adherence junction proteins,
thus controlling cell motility (7). A number of studies have
shown that S100A4 is a marker of poor prognosis in breast and
colon cancers (7, 8). We have shown that in cholangiocarcinoma
patients undergoing surgical resection, nuclear expression of
S100A4 in tumor cells is a strong, independent prognostic
marker of poor outcome in terms of both metastasization and
tumor-related death (9). Furthermore, S100A4 lentiviral silencing
signiﬁcantly reduced motility and invasive capabilities of
cholangiocarcinoma cells (9), suggesting that nuclear expression
of S100A4 is not merely a marker of cancer invasiveness,
but is a key determinant of the metastatic phenotype of
cholangiocarcinoma.
Aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms by which
nuclear S100A4 induces an invasive phenotype in cholangiocarcinoma and the mechanism regulating nuclear translocation of
S100A4. Unfortunately, mechanisms governing S100A4 expression in the nucleus remain elusive, and there are no strategies to
selectively target S100A4 nuclear import. In planning our experiments, we came across studies from the early 1990s showing
that paclitaxel was able to reduce the total expression of S100A4
in the B16 murine melanoma cells (10, 11).
Paclitaxel is a semisynthetic derivative of taxol, a natural
diterpene alkaloid, isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia.
Because of its antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, paclitaxel
is currently used in chemotherapy protocols for the treatment of
ovary, lung, thyroid, and breast carcinomas (12). Our study shows
that low-dose paclitaxel inhibits tumor invasiveness and hematogenous metastases by blocking SUMOylation-dependent
S100A4 nuclear import in cholangiocarcinoma.

Materials and Methods
Human established and primary cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines
The S100A4-expressing established cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines, EGI-1 (both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm) and
TFK-1 (only in the cytoplasm), both obtained from extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (9), were purchased from Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen. The primary cholangiocarcinoma cell line CCA-TV3 was isolated from
a human sample derived from surgical resection of an intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma, histologically categorized as cholangiocellular carcinoma (grade G3), performed
in Treviso Regional Hospital (M. Massani and T. Stecca), as
described previously (13). Local regional ethical committee
approval was obtained for tissue collection and cell preparation. Cultured cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and then frozen at low passages (<5). After any resuscitation, cell authentication was performed by checking morphology and by evaluating their immunophenotype as characterized by our previous studies (9, 13), including cytokeratin
(K)-7, K19, EpCAM (clone HEA125), E-cadherin, b-catenin,
and S100A4. Following experiments were run in cultured cells
with <20 passages. Mycoplasma contamination was excluded
using a speciﬁc biochemical test (Lonza).

Treatment with paclitaxel
In all experiments, cultured cholangiocarcinoma cells were
seeded and grown for 24 hours (otherwise differently indicated)
before exposure for 24 hours to paclitaxel at low doses (1.5 and 15
nmol/L, diluted in DMSO, Sigma), except for assessment of cell
proliferation, viability, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal integrity,
where high doses (150 and 1,500 nmol/L) were further tested.
Untreated cholangiocarcinoma cells served as controls.
Expression of S100A4
Differential expression of S100A4 was evaluated in cytoplasmic
and nuclear cell fractions by Western blotting using the same
primary antibody (DAKO, 1:2000) and the NE-PER Kit (Pierce) as
detection system, as already performed by us previously (9, 13).
Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase expression
Membrane-type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis in total lysate of
EGI-1 before and after paclitaxel treatment using an anti-MT1MMP mAb (Millipore, 1:500). The membrane expression levels of
MT1-MMP were then evaluated by assessing the ﬂuorescence
intensity proﬁle on cultured cells in ﬁve random ﬁelds for each
experiment (14). See Supplementary Data for details.
Cell proliferation and cell viability were evaluated by BrdUrd
(GE Healthcare) and MTS (Promega) respectively, while cell
apoptosis was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence for cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology). See Supplementary Data
for details.
Cytoskeletal integrity assessment
In paclitaxel-treated cholangiocarcinoma cells, actin ﬁlaments
were stained by Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen), and then the percentage of cells showing a damaged cytoskeleton on the total cultured cells was evaluated (15). In additional experiments, we assessed the expression of b-tubulin by
Western blot analysis in EGI-1 cells before and after exposure to
paclitaxel at different doses, in microtubule fractions puriﬁed by
ultracentrifugation (Cytoskeleton Inc).
Cell migration (wound-healing) assay
For details, see Supplementary Data.
Cell invasion (Boyden chamber) assay was performed as
described previously (9, 13).
Rho-A, Rac-1, and Cdc-42 GTP levels
For details, see Supplementary Data.
MMP-9 secretion
As ELISA assessed both pro and active MMP-9 forms (RayBiotech), we performed gelatin zymography in EGI-1 with and
without paclitaxel treatment to see whether MMP-9 was actually
active. For details, see Supplementary Data.
SUMOylation assay
Cholangiocarcinoma cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and let
to grow until conﬂuence, before exposure to paclitaxel. Cell
lysates were prepared using CelLytic MT (Sigma) and 200 mL
lysates (1 mg/mL) were loaded into column coated with VIVAbind SUMO matrix (VivaBioscience), to capture SUMOylated
proteins. SUMOylated protein fraction was then eluted and

analyzed by Western blot analysis (1:1,000). Amount of SUMOylated S100A4 was then related to that of total S100A4 (ﬂow
through) and compared with controls.
SUMO E1, E2, and E3 enzyme expression
In cholangiocarcinoma cells cultured and exposed to paclitaxel
as before, expression levels of the three enzymatic subunits, E1
(activating enzyme), E2 (conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ligase),
involved in SUMO modiﬁcation, were measured by real-time PCR
using speciﬁc probes (Life Technologies) and compared with
untreated cells.
Effects of ginkolic acid on S100A4 nuclearization, and on
cholangiocarcinoma cell viability and migration
Selected effects of ginkolic acid (GA), a well-established
SUMOylation inhibitor, on nuclearization of S100A4 (by Western blot analysis), cell viability (by MTS assay), and migration (by
wound-healing assay) of cholangiocarcinoma cells were studied
and compared with paclitaxel. Given the toxicity of GA, a preliminary dose–response experiment of cell viability was run
treating EGI-1 with increasing concentrations of GA (1, 10, 100
mmol/L) for 72 hours (16).
Xenotransplantation experiments in SCID mice
EGI-1 (500,000 cells suspended in PBS 100 mL) were injected into
the spleen of SCID mice (6–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories), after transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding the ﬁreﬂy
luciferase gene to enable detection of tumor engraftment by in vivo
bioluminescence imaging. Tumor engraftment was checked at
weekly intervals using the Living Image software (Xenogen), and
considered positive when reaching an average of at least 103 p/sec/
cm2/sr, according to our previous studies (9, 13). Cholangiocarcinoma cells injected intrasplenically are delivered straight into the
liver through the portal venous axis, giving rise to orthotopic
cholangiocarcinomas. Procedures involving animals and their care
conformed to the institutional guidelines that comply with national
and international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609,
OJ L 358, December 12, 1987), and approved by the Ethical
Committee of the University of Padua (Padua, Italy).
Low-dose metronomic paclitaxel treatment of SCID mice
xenotransplanted with human EGI-1 cells
Once tumor engraftment was conﬁrmed by bioluminescence
imaging (time 0), we started metronomic infusion of paclitaxel
[diluted in a 50%/50% solution of Cremophor EL (BASF)
and ethanol (Carlo Erba; vehicle)] for 2 weeks at the dosage of
2.6 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection using micro-osmotic
pumps (Alzet 1004, Durec). Mice were randomly divided into 2
experimental groups: (i) controls (vehicle only, n ¼ 14); (ii) lowdose metronomic (LDM) paclitaxel (n ¼ 10). After the ﬁrst week
of treatment, mice were checked by bioluminescence imaging
(time 1) to detect metastatic spread, as performed previously
(9, 13). At the end of treatment (time 2), after a further
bioluminescence analysis, mice were anesthetized and sacriﬁced for necroscopic examination and sample harvesting from
spleen (to evaluate the tumor mass at the site of injection) and
lungs (to evaluate hematogenous metastases). Tissue samples
were ﬁxed in buffered formalin and embedded in parafﬁn for
immunohistochemical analysis. The xenograft model is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1A.

www.aacrjournals.org

Assessment of the tumor growth in the site of engraftment
The tumor growth in the site of injection was evaluated in
parafﬁn-embedded sections obtained from the tumor-bearing
spleen and collected at the time of sacriﬁce. The tumor mass area
was measured using an electronic caliper and expressed in mm2.
Metastasis analysis
Serial sections from 10 different cutting plans at a 200-mm
interval were taken from lungs of sacriﬁced mice and stained by
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Supplementary Fig. S1B). In the
same section, IHC for human mitochondria (1:100, Millipore) was
performed to detect two different types of metastatic invasion,
isolated tumor cells (ITC), represented by single cells or small
clumps up to 5 cells, and micrometastases (MM), larger clusters
containing more than 5 cells (17–19). IHC for human mitochondria provides a useful tool to improve human cancer cell detection
in xenograft models. The metastases were expressed as total number
of human mitochondria–expressing cells in the 10 cutting plans.

For details, see Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis
In vitro experiments. Results were shown as the mean  SD.
Statistical comparisons were made using Student t test. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp.). A
two-tailed P value <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
In vivo experiments. Continuous data were shown as mean  SD,
and categorical data as counts and percentages. Distributions of
tumor size, number of MMs and ITCs in lung samples were
graphically displayed by box plots and scatter dot plots comparing
the two groups (paclitaxel vs. vehicle). One-sample Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test was used to check distributions for normality, while
Levene statistic was used for homogeneity of variances. Mean
differences between the two groups were analyzed with the two
independent samples t test or Welch test, according to the distribution characteristics. Welch t test is an adaptation of Student t test
and is more reliable when the two samples have unequal variances
and unequal sample sizes. Data were collected and reviewed in
Microsoft Excel, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
20.0 software. All two-tailed P < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Low-dose paclitaxel decreased expression of S100A4 in the
nucleus but not in the cytoplasm of EGI-1 and primary
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines
As previously shown (9), EGI-1 cells constitutively expressed
S100A4 in the nucleus, and therefore represent a good model to
study the effects of its nuclear downmodulation. Treatment with
low-dose paclitaxel (1.5 and 15 nmol/L) induced a signiﬁcant and
marked reduction in S100A4 nuclear expression (of about 60 and
80%, with respect to controls, respectively; Fig. 1A), without
modifying its cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 1B). This ﬁnding was
further conﬁrmed in primary cholangiocarcinoma cell lines
(CCA-TV3) obtained from a surgical sample similarly expressing
S100A4 in the nucleus; paclitaxel induced a dose-dependent
reduction in the nuclear levels of S100A4 of 38% (1.5 nmol/L)

nuclear reduction (Fig. 2A and B).

paclitaxel (Fig. 3A–C and Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C) in both
cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. These data indicate that in cholangiocarcinoma cells, nuclear expression of S100A4 exerts clear
promotile and proinvasive effects, without inﬂuencing the proliferation/apoptosis balance.
Low-dose paclitaxel reduced Rho-A and Cdc-42 activation and
MMP-9 secretion in EGI-1 cells
To better understand the mechanisms promoting cell motility
and invasiveness dependent upon S100A4 nuclearization, we
turned to study the effects of low-dose paclitaxel on the activity
of small Rho GTPases, the expression of MT1-MMP, and the
secretion of MMP-9. Small Rho GTPases are key effectors of cell
motility by inducing the formation of stress ﬁbers (Rho-A),
lamellipodia (Rac-1), and ﬁlopodia (Cdc-42; ref. 20). MMP-9,
on the other hand, is a proteolytic enzyme secreted by many
cancer cell types: it potently stimulates matrix degradation, facilitating the invasive migration of tumoral cells from the primary
site of growth (21). Its activation depends upon the expression of
membrane-anchored MMP, particularly of MT1-MMP, whose
expression at the surface of cancer cells is critical for breaking the
basement membrane (22). As EGI-1 phenocopied the behavior of
primary CCA-TV3 cell line, the following experiments were performed in EGI-1 only. As compared with controls, EGI-1 treated
with low-dose paclitaxel showed a signiﬁcant reduction in Rho-A
(Fig. 4A) and Cdc-42 (Fig. 4B) GTP levels, but not in Rac-1
(Supplementary Fig. S4). As evaluated by Western blot analysis
and immunoﬂuorescence on cultured EGI-1, MT1-MMP expression signiﬁcantly decreased after paclitaxel treatment (inhibition
of 40% and 46% with 1.5, and of 50% and 49% with 15 nmol/L,
for Western blot analysis and immunoﬂuorescence, respectively;
Fig. 4C and D). Similarly, MMP-9 secretion and activation were
inhibited by challenging cholangiocarcinoma cell cultures with
paclitaxel, as shown by ELISA (inhibition of 57% with 1.5, and of
72% with 15 nmol/L) and gel zymography (Fig. 4E and F).
Low-dose paclitaxel did not induce cytoskeletal damage in
EGI-1 cells
S100A4 is normally associated to cytoskeletal ﬁbers. To study
whether low-dose paclitaxel altered cytoskeletal integrity, we
performed phalloidin ﬂuorescence in dose-dependent experiments, ranging from 1.5–15 nmol/L to 150–1500 nmol/L. In
contrast with high-dose paclitaxel, which induced actin ﬁber
changes (shortening, thickening, fragmentation often leading to
dense coiling, accumulating in the perinuclear area) in 16% (150
nmol/L) and 32% (1,500 nmol/L) of cultured EGI-1, more than
90% of cells treated with low-dose paclitaxel showed preserved
cytoskeletal structure (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data indicate that effects of low-dose paclitaxel on cell motility and
invasiveness are not due to a cytoskeletal damage. Next, we sought
to understand the mechanisms regulating the nuclear import of
S100A4.
Paclitaxel selectively reduced the SUMOylation fraction of
S100A4, a critical mechanism for cell invasiveness of EGI-1 cells
Posttranslational modiﬁcation by small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer (SUMO) of target proteins is an important mechanism directing their intracellular shuttling. We showed that EGI-1 contained
much higher amounts of SUMOylated S100A4 than TFK-1, a
cholangiocarcinoma cell line expressing S100A4 only in the

cytoplasm, where instead un-SUMOylated S100A4 was detected
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Furthermore, after treatment with lowdose paclitaxel, EGI-1 showed a marked reduction selectively in
the SUMOylated fraction of S100A4 as compared with controls,
whereas the S100A4 unSUMOylated levels remained unchanged
(Fig. 5A). SUMO inhibition by paclitaxel was not associated with
decreased mRNA expression levels of the three SUMO E components of the SUMOylating complex (Supplementary Fig. S6B–
S6D). To study whether the inhibition of SUMOylation halted
cell-invasive capabilities, EGI-1 were treated with GA, a speciﬁc
natural inhibitor of the E1 subunit. Preliminary dose–response
experiments to assess toxicity levels of GA on EGI-1 cells identiﬁed
1 mmol/L as the dose devoid of effects on cell viability (not
shown), and therefore used onwards. Consistent with our hypothesis, GA signiﬁcantly reduced cell motility of EGI-1 with respect to
controls (Fig. 5B), an effect associated with a signiﬁcant reduction
(37%) in the nuclear expression of S100A4 to an extent comparable with paclitaxel 1.5 nmol/L, without affecting the cytoplasmic levels of S100A4 (Fig. 5C and D).
Paclitaxel treatment reduced lung metastasization but not the
tumor growth at the site of injection in the experimental model
of cholangiocarcinoma
Altogether, the in vitro data suggest that the SUMOylationdependent nuclear import of S100A4 is indeed a mechanistic

determinant of the invasive phenotype of cholangiocarcinoma
cells, which can be inhibited by paclitaxel at nanomolar doses
without altering the cytoskeletal integrity, as well as the proliferation and/or apoptosis activities. To test in vivo whether targeting
nuclear S100A4 by low-dose paclitaxel is therapeutically relevant
to reduce cholangiocarcinoma invasiveness, we moved to the
experimental model of cholangiocarcinoma generated by EGI-1
cell xenotransplantation in the SCID mouse (9, 13).
To reproduce the small nmol/L doses of paclitaxel able to
hamper S100A4 nuclear entry in cholangiocarcinoma cells in
vitro, a low-dose metronomic regimen was chosen for drug infusion in xenografted mice (LDM paclitaxel). To assess speciﬁc
effects on cancer invasiveness, the treatment was started upon
successful EGI-1 cell engraftment as conﬁrmed by bioluminescence imaging (on average 29.75  4.53 days after intrasplenic
injection). Notably, before starting LDM paclitaxel, the levels of
photon emission were comparable between the two groups. With
respect to control animals, LDM paclitaxel neither signiﬁcantly
reduced the photon emission from the spleen through the treatment time (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B) nor the size of the
splenic tumor mass at the time of sacriﬁce (Supplementary Fig.
S7C). IHC in tissue sections obtained from the tumor mass
conﬁrmed that LDM paclitaxel was effective in decreasing
S100A4 expression in the nucleus of engrafted EGI-1 cells compared with controls (Fig. 6A); however, the expression of p-Hist3

reproduces the downmodulating effects on S100A4 nuclear
expression by EGI-1 shown in vitro, without causing a dysregulation in the proliferation/apoptosis balance of cholangiocarcinoma cells. In contrast, LDM paclitaxel signiﬁcantly halted metastatic dissemination. IHC for human mitochondria revealed that
both ITCs and MMs in the lung were signiﬁcantly reduced by

paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 7A and B). These data further prove the
functional impact of S100A4 nuclear expression on cholangiocarcinoma biology as a mechanism speciﬁcally driving hematogenous metastasization, without stimulating tumorigenesis.

approaches, is the development of biomarkers able to identify
patients most likely to take advantage of curative treatments.
Biomarkers may also represent disease-relevant targets for
therapeutic interventions (9). Our previous studies showed that
nuclear expression of S100A4 in cancer cells of resected cholangiocarcinoma (nearly a half) identiﬁed a more invasive clinical
phenotype, characterized by increased metastasization and
reduced survival after surgery (9). Notably, a worse prognosis
after surgery was still observed even when S100A4 nuclear expression was scattered, limited to less than 30% of the neoplastic ducts
(9). The aim of the current study was to understand the mechanisms by which nuclear expression of S100A4 promotes cancer
invasiveness, and to elucidate the mechanism regulating nuclear
translocation of S100A4. We also wanted to understand whether
these mechanisms are putative target for therapeutic intervention.
We initially found that paclitaxel given in vitro at low doses (1.5
and 15 nmol/L) was able to effectively and selectively downregulate S100A4 expression in the nucleus of cholangiocarcinoma
cells, leaving cytoplasmic expression unaffected. Then, by combining in vitro and in vivo techniques, we showed that: (i) paclitaxel
-induced downregulation of nuclear S100A4 was associated with
a reduction in motility and invasiveness of cholangiocarcinoma
cells, in activity of Rho-A and Cdc-42, and in secretion of MMP-9;
(ii) at the doses able to downregulate nuclear expression of
S100A4, paclitaxel did not affect cell proliferation, apoptosis,
and cytoskeletal architecture; (iii) the nuclear translocation of
S100A4 was regulated by SUMOylation, a posttranslational
mechanism that was affected by paclitaxel; (iv) in SCID mice
xenografted with human nuclear S100A4–expressing cholangiocarcinoma cells, downregulation of nuclear S100A4 by LDM
paclitaxel was associated with a reduction in hematogenous
metastasization.
The biological functions of S100A4 are largely unknown. They
depend on its interacting partners, which are mainly located in the
cytoplasm, where S100A4 is commonly expressed. In the nucleus,
interacting partners have not been characterized yet, opening the
possibility that nuclear S100A4 may act independently as transcription factor (7).
Earlier studies showed that in mouse melanoma cells, taxol at
conventional doses, reduced the total amount of S100A, an effect

associated with maintenance in the G0 phase of the cells
and increased expression of p53 (10, 11). We initially found that
in cholangiocarcinoma cells, low doses of paclitaxel (1.5–15
nmol/L) induced a marked reduction in S100A4 selectively in
the nucleus, without altering its cytoplasmic expression. This
effect, obtained in an established cholangiocarcinoma cell line
(EGI-1) was reproduced in a primary cholangiocarcinoma cell
line derived from a patient undergoing surgical resection. The
nuclear downregulation of S100A4 was biologically relevant as it
associated with a strong inhibition of the motile and invasive
properties displayed by cholangiocarcinoma cells in culture. Interestingly, at the same small doses, paclitaxel did not exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions, nor it affected cell viability
or the integrity of the actin cytoskeletal ﬁlaments of cultured
cholangiocarcinoma cells. All these cytotoxic effects were instead
induced by paclitaxel at higher doses (150–1,500 nmol/L), coupled with pronounced antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities, in line with the mechanism of action supporting the current
indications of paclitaxel for the chemotherapeutic treatment of
several aggressive carcinomas, from ovary to breast and thyroid
cancer (23, 24). The lack of proproliferative stimuli when S100A4
translocates into the nucleus has been recently shown also in
colorectal cancer cells (25). In this study, although S100A4
translocated into the nucleus in a cell-cycle–dependent fashion,
being most prominent in the G2–M phase, lentiviral silencing of
nuclear S100A4 did not induce changes in cell proliferation. Our
ﬁndings are consistent with these observations, and conﬁrm that
nuclear S100A4 confers speciﬁc proinvasive functions.
Among putative molecular players mediating the effects of
nuclear S100A4 on cell motility and invasiveness, we focused
on the small G proteins (GTPases) belonging to the Rho family
and on MMPs. The small Rho GTPases are recognized as key
effectors able to activate invasion and metastasis programs
(20, 26). In EGI-1 cells, inhibition of S100A4 nuclear import by
low-dose paclitaxel signiﬁcantly reduced the activation of Rho-A
and Cdc-42. In cancer cells, Cdc-42 is one of the factors involved in
the formation of specialized plasma-membrane actin-based
microdomains combining adhesive properties with matrixdegrading activities, called invadopodia, which support cancer
invasion by dismantling the basement membrane and then by

invading the stromal environment mostly composed of ﬁbrillar
type I collagen. A main component of invadopodia is the
transmembrane metalloproteinase MT1-MMP, whose function
is essential for the in situ to invasive carcinoma transition in
breast cancer (14). MT1-MMP promotes the activation of
several soluble MMPs, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. Our data
indicate that EGI-1 cells constitutively expressed MT1-MMP
and MMP-9, but not MMP-2, and when exposed to low-dose
paclitaxel, they showed a signiﬁcant dose-dependent reduction
in the surface expression of MT1-MMP along with the ability to
secrete MMP-9. Interestingly, the interplay between Rho-A and
Cdc-42 regulates the delivery and accumulation of MMPs at the
invading surface (27). Furthermore, as MMP-9 secretion can be
also modulated by the activation of the Rho-A/ROCK signaling
(21), and the membrane translocation of MT1-MMP is directly
regulated by Cdc-42 (28), we suggest the cooperation of Rho-A/
MMP-9 and Cdc-42/MT1-MMP pathways to form invadopodia
activated by nuclear S100A4.
Cytoskeletal damages induced by paclitaxel, a well-established
depolymerizing agent (29), could in theory, inﬂuence the nuclear
translocation of S100A4. From this point of view, it is important
to underline that structural cytoskeleton alterations were absent
with low-dose paclitaxel, in contrast with what coherently
observed with high-dose paclitaxel.
The mechanisms regulating S100A4 entry into the nucleus
remain enigmatic. Notably, S100A4 does not possess nuclear
docking sites or nuclear import sequences. In human chondrocytes, nuclearization of S100A4 was induced by IL1b through a
SUMOylation-dependent mechanism (30). SUMOylation is a
posttranslational mechanism similar to ubiquitination, operated
by SUMO proteins, and involved in several biological functions,
including protein stability, DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation,
apoptosis, nuclear transport, and gene transcription (31). The
SUMOylation processes are catalyzed by three enzymes, SUMO
E1, E2, and E3, acting as a pacemaker of the cascade reaction
leading to the modiﬁcation of their substrate protein (32). Components of the SUMOylation machinery have been found deregulated in several human cancers, and are emerging as relevant
players in tumor invasiveness and in epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (33). We found that EGI-1 (expressing S100A4 the
nucleus) contained higher amounts of SUMOylated S100A4 with
respect to TFK-1 (expressing S100A4 only in the cytoplasm). Then,
in EGI-1 treated with low-dose paclitaxel, downregulation of
nuclear S100A4 was associated with a signiﬁcant, dose-dependent
reduction in the S100A4 SUMOylated fraction, without changes
in the un-SUMOylated subset. These effects occurred without
affecting the expression levels of E1, E2, E3 subunits of the
SUMOylating complex, thus suggesting a functional inhibitory
mechanism, similar to GA. GA is a natural compound derived
from Gingko biloba that speciﬁcally inhibits the ﬁrst step of the
SUMOylation reaction by directly binding E1 and inhibiting the
formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate (16). Of note, also the
reduction in nuclear levels of S100A4 induced by GA signiﬁcantly
inhibited EGI-1 cell motility, to an extent comparable with
paclitaxel. This observation conﬁrms the relevance of SUMOylation in mediating the pro-oncogenic functions of S100A4 when
translocated into the nucleus.
To translate the results of the in vitro experiments, we turned to
an experimental model of cholangiocarcinoma generated by
xenotransplantation of human EGI-1 cells into the spleen of SCID
mice, as we performed in previous studies (9, 13). Because of its

short half-life (34), paclitaxel was administered to xenografted
SCID mice with a LDM infusion. Continuous delivery of paclitaxel by LDM ensured the achievement of constant low concentrations of paclitaxel comparable with the small doses used for the
in vitro experiments (34). To evaluate speciﬁc effects on tumor
invasion, LDM paclitaxel was started only after human cholangiocarcinoma cell engraftment was conﬁrmed by bioluminescence imaging. At the end of treatment, histologic evaluation of
the splenic tumor showed in the LDM paclitaxel–treated group, a
signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of nuclear S100A4-expressing
EGI-1 cells. In line with what observed in vitro, downregulation of
S100A4 was not associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation
(p-Hist3) or with increased apoptosis (CC3) of cholangiocarcinoma cells. Therefore, our experimental model is ideal to study
whether the pharmacologic targeting of nuclear S100A4 is a useful
strategy to inhibit invasiveness and metastasization. We found
that LDM paclitaxel did not affect the growth of the tumor at the
site of injection, but caused a signiﬁcant reduction in both ITCs
and MMs in the lungs, where EGI-1 cells metastasize following a
hematogenous route through the portal vein and the hepatic
veins. This ﬁnding is of great clinical value, because the lung is
the site most frequently involved in the extrahepatic progression
of cholangiocarcinoma, fostered by a speciﬁc mechanism of
vascular encasement by tumor cells (5).
It is important to underline that paclitaxel may exert additional
functions not related to modulation of S100A4 nuclear transport
that potentially may contribute to its anti-invasive effects. These
are largely dependent upon paclitaxel ability to promote microtubule polymerization and stabilization, which inhibits mitosis
and leads to apoptosis. While these mechanisms of action are well
evident at the conventional doses, at the much lower doses used in
the current study, they do not seem to occur. Recent studies
performed in ovarian carcinoma cells indicate that alternatively,
paclitaxel may inhibit the expression of other critical molecular
factors of tumor progression, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
and VEGF (35).
In conclusion, this study unveils a speciﬁc role of SUMOylation-dependent nuclear import of S100A4 in cholangiocarcinoma
on hematogenous metastasization. The small GTPases Cdc-42
and Rho-A, in concert with MT1-MMP and MMP-9, are the
molecular effectors mediating the proinvasive functions promoted by S100A4 nuclearization. Bearing in mind the potential toxic
effects of paclitaxel in patients with overt cirrhosis and cholestasis
(36), these mechanisms represents a promising therapeutic target
aimed at preventing metastatic dissemination after detection of
the tumor.
