Abstract
STAT3 promotes the survival, proliferation, metastasis, immune escape, and drug resistance of cancer cells,
making its targeting an appealing prospect. However, although multiple inhibitors of STAT3 and its regulatory or
effector pathway elements have been developed, bioactive agents have been somewhat elusive. In this report, we
report the identiﬁcation of a speciﬁc STAT3-binding peptide (APTSTAT3) through phage display of a novel "aptide"
library. APTSTAT3 bound STAT3 with high speciﬁcity and afﬁnity (231 nmol/L). Addition of a cell-penetrating
motif to the peptide to yield APTSTAT3-9R enabled uptake by murine B16F1 melanoma cells. Treatment of various
types of cancer cells with APTSTAT3-9R blocked STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced expression of STAT targets,
including cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and survivin. As a result, APTSTAT3-9R suppressed the viability and proliferation of
cancer cells. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of APTSTAT3-9R exerted potent antitumor activity in both
xenograft and allograft tumor models. Our results offer a preclinical proof-of-concept for APTSTAT3 as a tractable
agent for translation to target the broad array of cancers harboring constitutively activated STAT3. Cancer

Introduction
STAT3, a member of the STAT family, has received considerable attention for the important role it plays in signaling
pathways linked to inﬂammation-associated diseases and cancers (1). Notably, unlike the transient activation of STAT3
characteristic of normal cells, STAT3 tends to be constitutively
activated in most cancer cells. In these cells, STAT3 is associated
with tumorigenesis and malignancy because its downstream
signaling results in production of a number of cytokines that
regulate proliferation, angiogenesis, survival, and metastasis (2).
For these reasons, many research groups have focused on
developing inhibitors that can block upstream or downstream
elements in the STAT3 signaling pathway (3, 4). Upon activation, STAT3 becomes phosphorylated and undergoes dimerization. The active, dimeric form enters the nucleus, in which it
binds to target DNA-response elements, leading to the expression of proteins related to cancer progression and malignancy.
Thus, inhibitors reported to date, including small molecules

(5–9), decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN; ref. 10), siRNAs (11),
and peptides (12, 13) and their peptidomimetics (14, 15), target
one of the key steps required for STAT3-mediated gene expression. Several small molecules that can inhibit phosphorylation
and subsequent dimerization by binding to the SH2 domain of
STAT3 have been shown to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro
and reduce tumor burden in vivo, and indeed a few such
inhibitors are now in various phases of clinical trials (3). Decoy
ODNs that can intercept the active form of the STAT3 dimer
also show potential as inhibitors in in vivo tumor models (16).
Peptide-based STAT3 inhibitors have also been reported. These
inhibitory phospho-peptides (P YLKTK, Y LPQTV), based on a
truncated gp130 sequence, bind to the SH2 domain of STAT3
and block dimerization (17, 18). However, the relatively low
potency and limited cell permeability of such phospho-peptides
have hampered their further use in an in vivo setting. Peptide
libraries have been screened for interaction with the DNAbinding domain (DBD) of STAT3, and the identiﬁed peptides
have been shown to inhibit STAT3 DNA-binding activity (19).
Very recently, a short peptide derived from the helices of the Nterminal domain of STAT3 has been shown to inhibit STAT3
transcriptional activity (20). However, although these peptide
inhibitors have shown cytotoxicity in various cancer cells by
blocking STAT3 signaling, to date there have been few reports
demonstrating antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo (3, 21).
Aptides, developed by our laboratory, constitute a platform
technology that enables screening and identiﬁcation of highafﬁnity and -speciﬁcity peptides for various biologic targets (22).
An aptide consists of a tryptophan zipper scaffold that forms a
robust b-hairpin structure and a target-binding site containing

(Fig. 1A). Phage display of an aptide library has enabled us to
identify a number of aptides speciﬁc to various protein targets
(22). Most such aptides showed afﬁnities in the tens of nanomolar range, even before afﬁnity maturation, and as such
represent a general source of high-afﬁnity binders. Here, we
report the screening and identiﬁcation of a STAT3-speciﬁc
aptide (APTSTAT3) and evaluate its potential as an inhibitor of
STAT3 signaling in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor-bearing
mice in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, APTSTAT3 is the ﬁrst
reported peptide inhibitor to show therapeutic efﬁcacy in in vivo
animal models by blocking STAT3 activation.

Screening and identiﬁcation of STAT3-speciﬁc binders
A STAT3-speciﬁc aptide was identiﬁed using a phage display-based screening method, as described previously (22).
Brieﬂy, STAT3 was immobilized on 96-well plates (Corning)
overnight at 4 C. After incubating phage library pools on
STAT3-immobilized plates for 1 hour at 25 C, unbound phages
were removed by washing with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20
(PBS-T), and bound phages were eluted with 0.2 mol/L glycine
buffer (pH 2.2), followed by immediate neutralization with
Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). The eluted phages were ampliﬁed using
log-phase cultures of Escherichia coli ER2537 (New England
Biolabs). The above mentioned screening steps were iterated
with the ampliﬁed phages several times until speciﬁc phages
enriched. After biopanning, phage ELISAs were carried out.
Bound phages were detected by incubating with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-M13 antibody (GE Healthcare) followed by monitoring absorbance at 450 nm after incubation with the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine.
DNA-binding assay
Following treatment of cells with APTSTAT3-9R, APRscr-9R, or
PBS for 6 hours, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for
STAT3 DNA-binding activity in triplicate using a TransAM
STAT3 Transcription Factor Assay Kit, following the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Ribo EX (GeneAll) and
subjected for reverse transcription using Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR were carried out as described
previously (23).
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared in PRO-PREP protein extraction
solution. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford
assay. A sample of 30 mg of each protein was loaded in 15%
SDS–PAGE gels. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore). The
membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumen (BSA)
in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2
hours followed by overnight incubation at 4 C with primary
antibodies in TBST containing 5% BSA. The membranes were
then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in
TBST containing 5% BSA for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Anti-mouse and -rabbit antibody were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Speciﬁc proteins were detected by ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad).
Cell viability assay
Cells were plated in a 96-well plate (5,000 cells/well) and
incubated for 12 hours. After incubation the cells were treated
with nine-arginine (9R), APTSTAT3-9R, and APRscr-9R for 12
hours. After 12 hours incubation, 20 mL MTT (5 mg/mL) was
added to each well. After 4 hours, 100 mL dimethyl sulfoxide
was added to each well, and absorbance was measured at 570
nm using a Spectra Macplus microplate reader (Molecular
Devices).

Colony formation assay
Cells in growth medium were cultured at 500 cells per well in
12-well plates and treated with APTSTAT3-9R, APRscr-9R, or PBS
on the following day. Cells were then allowed to grow for 2
weeks until colonies were visible. Colonies were stained by
incubating with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 20
minutes.
Flow cytometry analysis
The Annexin V–ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Apoptosis
Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) was used to detect apoptosis by
ﬂow cytometry. Cells were exposed to APTSTAT3-9R, APRscr-9R,
or PBS treatment at 30 mmol/L, and after 6 hours, they were
harvested (including detached cells), and processed according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Antitumor efﬁcacy in the A549 xenograft tumor
model
A549 cells (1  107 cells) were harvested and resuspended
in 50 mL F12K media and injected subcutaneously into the
right ﬂank of 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Approximately 14 days later, when tumor volumes had reached
approximately 50 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into
three groups (n ¼ 5 mice/group): APTSTAT3-9R, APRscr-9R,
and PBS. Mice were intratumorally injected four times with
APTSTAT3-9R and APRscr-9R (8 mg/kg in 50 mL PBS) or PBS.
At the same time, tumor volume was determined by measuring with calipers and calculated according to the formula,
A  B2  0:5, where A is the longest dimension of the tumor
and B is the shortest dimension of the tumor. After 30 days,
mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were excised for use in
other assays. All mice were maintained at an animal facility
under pathogen-free conditions. Experimental procedures
and handling of mice were carried out in accordance with
experimental animal guidelines approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences among groups was
calculated by one-way ANOVA. A P value of < 0.001 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results and Discussion
A speciﬁc STAT3-binding peptide and its cell permeable
derivative
Using phage display of an aptide library, we were able to
screen and identify a speciﬁc STAT3-binding peptide (Fig.
1A). A total of four rounds of selection were performed to
enrich for phage clones that showed speciﬁcity for STAT3 in
phage ELISAs (Supplementary Fig. S1). Sequencing of the
bound phages yielded only an aptide sequence. The afﬁnity
and speciﬁcity of the identiﬁed STAT3-binding aptide (APTSTAT3) were measured. A surface plasmon resonance assay
revealed that APTSTAT3 bound to STAT3 with a dissociation
constant (Kd) of 231 nmol/L; a control peptide containing
the same trpzip scaffold but with a scrambled sequence in
the target-binding site, APTscr, did not bind STAT3 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Phage ELISAs showed that the phage

displaying APTSTAT3 sequence was highly speciﬁc to the
target STAT3 compared with other proteins, whereas the
phage displaying APTscr sequence showed no appreciable
binding to any of the proteins tested (Fig. 1B). To impart cell
permeability to APTSTAT3, we fused APTSTAT3 with a 9R, a
cell-penetrating peptide (Fig. 1A; ref. 24). ELISAs using an
antiaptide monoclonal antibody (mAb) showed that
APTSTAT3-9R was also able to speciﬁcally bind STAT3 with
a comparable binding ability to APTSTAT3, as evidenced by a
concentration-dependent increase in the ELISA signal,
whereas the 9R-modiﬁed scrambled aptide (APTscr-9R)
showed little signal enhancement (Fig. 1C). Next, we examined whether the attachment of 9R to the aptides would
enable cell penetration and, thus, intracellular localization.
As clearly shown in Fig. 1D, most B16F1 melanoma cells
treated with FITC-labeled APTSTAT3-9R or APTscr-9R showed
intense ﬂuorescence signals in the cytosol, demonstrating
cellular uptake and conﬁrming the cell-penetrating ability of
the 9R-conjugated aptides.

APTSTAT3-9R inhibits STAT3 activation and downstream
signaling by speciﬁcally blocking STAT3
phosphorylation
To examine whether binding of APTSTAT3-9R to STAT3 is
able to affect STAT3-mediated signaling pathway, we carried
out STAT3–DNA-binding assays. Human lung carcinoma cells
(A549) were chosen because they are known to maintain high
levels of constitutively activated STAT3 (1). The cells were
treated with various concentrations of APTSTAT3-9R (7.5, 15,
and 30 mmol/L) or APTscr-9R (30 mmol/L) for 6 hours and then
DNA-binding activity of the activated STAT3 dimer existing in
the cell extracts was measured using a STAT3 Transcription
Factor Assay Kit (see Supplementary Information). APTSTAT3
-9R signiﬁcantly reduced STAT3–DNA-binding activity in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas APTscr-9R even at a concentration of 30 mmol/L did not affect STAT3–DNA-binding
activity in A549 cells (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that
APTSTAT3 is not a just binder but an effector involved in
inhibition of homo- or heterodimerization of P-STAT3. To

further examine the inhibitory effect of APTSTAT3-9R on STAT3
downstream signaling, we measured mRNA expression of the
STAT3 target genes, cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and survivin (10), by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Treatment with
APTSTAT3-9R decreased the mRNA levels of the indicated
targets in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells, whereas
APTscr-9R (30 mmol/L) treatment had little effect (Fig. 2B).
Next, we estimated the expression of these genes at the protein
level by Western blotting after treatments of A549 cells with
APTSTAT3-9R (7.5, 15, and 30 mmol/L) or APTscr-9R (30 mmol/L)
for 6 hours. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression level of each
protein was markedly decreased by treatment with APTSTAT3
-9R in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in
untreated controls. As expected, cells treated with nonrelevant
APTscr-9R showed no appreciable difference in the levels of
these proteins compared with controls. Furthermore, a similar
trend of results was also obtained in various murine and
human cancer cell lines, including B16F1, HepG2, MDA-MB231, and U87MG that are known to express constitutively
activated STAT3, conﬁrming the inhibitory effect of
APTSTAT3-9R on STAT3 downstream signaling (Supplementary
Figs. S3–S5). Interestingly, we found that APTSTAT3-9R effectively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2D) but did not
affect the level of AKT phosphorylation, indicating speciﬁcity
of the aptide. This suggests that APTSTAT3-9R may be able to
suppress expression of STAT3-associated target genes by
speciﬁcally inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation.
On one hand, there are other proteins belonging to STAT
family, some of which have some degree of sequence homology
to STAT3. Thus, we further examined the speciﬁcity of
APTSTAT3 over other STATs. Phage ELISAs using a phage
displaying APTSTAT3 sequence against STAT3, STAT1, and
STAT5 revealed preferential binding of the aptide phage to
the target STAT3 over STAT1 or STAT5 (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). Furthermore, as shown in the Western blot analysis data
in A549 cells following treatment with APTSTAT3-9R or APTscr
-9R (30 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S6B), APTSTAT3-9R significantly inhibited only STAT3 phosphorylation but did not
affect phosphorylation of other STAT1 and STAT5, indicating
high speciﬁcity of the STAT3 aptide. On the other hand, it is
known that the SH2 domain of STAT3 plays a key role in
membrane recruitment, recognition of the phosphorylated
site, and subsequent homodimerization of P-STAT3 (7, 21).
To elucidate the binding site of APTSTAT3 in STAT3, we carried
out binding assays using phage ELISAs for STAT3 and its
domains: DBD, SH2 domain, and transactivation domain (TA).
A phage displaying APTSTAT3 sequence showed much higher
binding to SH2 domain than other domains (TA and DBD),
which was close to the level of binding to parent STAT3;
however, moderate binding to DBD was also observed (Supplementary Fig. S7A). This ﬁnding suggests that the SH2
domain may be a putative binding site of the aptide. Furthermore, to obtain a piece of clues about the mode-of-action of
APTSTAT3, we carried out a JAK2 kinase activity assay as the
kinase is a key enzyme responsible for STAT phosphorylation.
As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C, phosphorylation of the plate-immobilized STAT3 by JAK2 was signiﬁcantly inhibited with increasing amounts of APTSTAT3-9R,

2148

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

whereas the control scrambled peptide minimally affected the
JAK2 activity. Although more studies such as the X-ray crystallographic study on the STAT3–APTSTAT3 complex are
required to probe the exact binding site and the mode-ofaction of APTSTAT3, we speculate that tight binding of APTSTAT3
to the SH2 domain may inhibit the interaction between STAT3
and JAK2 during the membrane recruitment step, thereby
causing inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation.
APTSTAT3-9R suppresses cell viability and proliferation of
cancer cells
To examine whether the inhibitory effect of APTSTAT3-9R on
STAT3 signaling affects cancer cell viability, we performed
MTT assays. The IC50 value of APTSTAT3-9R was estimated to be
10 to 20 mmol/L in A549 cells; in contrast, those of APTScr-9R
and 9R alone were estimated to be >100 mmol/L (Fig. 3A). A
similar level of IC50 values was attained in B16F1 and HepG2
cells treated with APTSTAT3-9R (Supplementary Figs. S3D and
S4C). In addition, we carried out colony formation assay to
assess whether APTSTAT3-9R suppresses cancer cell proliferation. Proliferation of A549 and B16F1 cancer cells was monitored for 2 weeks after cell seeding (500 cells/well) in the
presence of APTSTAT3-9R or APTscr-9R (30 mmol/L). Colony
formation was signiﬁcantly suppressed in the APTSTAT3-9R–
treated group but not in the APTscr-9R group (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Fig. S3E). Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that
APTSTAT3-9R treatment induced apoptosis of A549 cells by
approximately 3-fold increase compared with APTscr-9R in
ﬂow cytometry assessment (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results
indicate that APTSTAT3-9R effectively suppresses cell survival
and growth.
APTSTAT3-9R suppresses tumor growth in vivo
Encouraged by the potency of APTSTAT3-9R in inhibiting cell
proliferation in vitro, we explored the antitumor efﬁcacy of the
aptide in vivo. A human lung carcinoma xenograft model was
prepared by subcutaneous implantation of A549 cancer cells.
After tumors had reached a volume of approximately 50 mm3
(2 weeks), APTSTAT3-9R or APTscr-9R (8 mg/kg) was intratumorally injected every other day for a total of four injections.
Tumor burden was signiﬁcantly reduced (65% relative to the
control) in the APTSTAT3-9R–treated group (Fig. 4A) compared with that in the PBS control group; however, there was
little difference in tumor size between APTscr-9R and PBS
groups. Images of excised tumors at day 30 further indicate
signiﬁcant difference between the aptide-treated group and
control groups (Fig. 4B). We found that the amount of PSTAT3 in the excised tumor tissues of the APTSTAT3-9R–
treated group was substantially diminished, whereas APTscr
-9R did not show any appreciable inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in the tumor tissues (Fig. 4C). Furthermore,
TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling) assays on excised tumor tissues
revealed that, unlike PBS or the scrambled aptide–treated
groups, the APTSTAT3-9R–treated group showed a signiﬁcant
level of apoptosis in tumor sections, presumably due to
inhibition of STAT3 activation and downstream signaling
(Fig. 4D). In addition to the A549 xenograft mouse model,

staining were denoted in x- and y-axis, respectively. The number represents the percentage of apoptotic cells (upper right quadrant).

we also evaluated the anticancer efﬁcacy of APTSTAT3-9R in
two additional tumor models, B16F1 melanoma allograft and
U87MG glioblastoma xenograft models. Because B16F1 melanoma tumor is known to be aggressive and rapidly grows,
APTSTAT3-9R was injected to the same foot pad in which the
melanoma cells were implanted 2 days ago as suggested in the
protocol published elsewhere (25). The APTSTAT3-9R substantially reduced tumor burden by approximately 49% and, thus,
extended survival time by more than 15 days compared with
the control (PBS-treated) group (Supplementary Fig. S8). In
the case of the U87MG glioblastoma xenograft tumor model
the ﬁrst intratumoral injection of each group was initiated
when the tumor volumes had reached approximately 120 mm3
and terminated after a total of four times injection. The tumor
growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited by treatment of the STAT3speciﬁc aptide but little inhibition was seen from the scrambled aptide–treated group (45% vs. 7% inhibition; Supplementary Fig. S9). Collectively, these results indicate that
APTSTAT3-9R could effectively suppress tumor growth in the

www.aacrjournals.org

in vivo allograft and xenograft tumor models by inhibiting
STAT3 phosphorylation.

Conclusion
In summary, we screened and identiﬁed a speciﬁc STAT3binding peptide (APTSTAT3) using aptide platform technology.
With the addition of a cell-penetrating motif, the resulting
APTSTAT3-9R aptide was able to suppress the viability and
proliferation of cancer cells by blocking STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting STAT3 downstream signaling. Furthermore, intratumorally injected APTSTAT3-9R showed potent
antitumor activity in both xenograft and allograft tumor
models. To the best of our knowledge, APTSTAT3-9R is the ﬁrst
example of a peptide-based STAT3 inhibitor demonstrating
potent antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that APTSTAT3 holds potential for the treatment of
cancers maintaining high level of constitutively activated
STAT3. Further works are currently undergoing to examine
