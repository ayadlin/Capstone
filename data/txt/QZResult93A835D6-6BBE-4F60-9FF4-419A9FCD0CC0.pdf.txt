Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of
transcription factors with important regulatory roles in cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Using
proteomic analysis, we showed expression of PPARγ protein in a series of 260 newly diagnosed primary acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples. Forced expression of PPARγ enhanced the sensitivity of myeloid leukemic cells to apoptosis induced by PPARγ agonists 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)
and 15-deoxy-12,14-15DPGJ2, through preferential cleavage of caspase-8. No effects on cell cycle distribution
or differentiation were noted, despite prominent induction of p21 in PPARγ-transfected cells. In turn, antagonizing PPARγ function by small interfering RNA or pharmacologic PPARγ inhibitor significantly diminished
apoptosis induction by CDDO. Overexpression of coactivator protein DRIP205 resulted in enhanced differentiation induction by CDDO in AML cells through PPARγ activation. Studies with DRIP205 deletion constructs
showed that the NR boxes of DRIP205 are not required for this coactivation. In a phase I clinical trial of CDDO
(RTA-401) in leukemia, CDDO induced an increase in PPARγ mRNA expression in six of nine patient samples;
of those, induction of differentiation was documented in four patients and that of p21 in three patients, all
expressing DRIP205 protein. In summary, these findings suggest that cellular levels of PPARγ regulate induction of apoptosis via caspase-8 activation, whereas the coactivator DRIP205 is a determinant of induction of
differentiation, in response to PPARγ agonists in leukemic cells. Cancer Res; 70(12); 4949–60. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are
ligand-activated transcription factors that are members of
the nuclear hormone receptor gene superfamily. To date,
three PPAR subtypes have been identified, namely, PPARα,
PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ (also termed as NR1C1, NR1C2, and

NR1C3, respectively; ref. 1). PPARγ is an important regulator
of lipid and glucose homeostasis, cellular differentiation, and
inflammation. There are three PPARγ isoforms differing at
their 5′ ends, each under the control of its own promoter
(2). Most tissues express the PPARγ1 isoform, whereas the
PPARγ2 isoform is specific to adipocytes. However, the receptor is expressed in many others tissues and cell types
such as monocytes and macrophages, skeletal muscle, breast,
prostate, colon, and type 2 alveolar pneumocytes.
PPARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR).
Transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors (NR), including PPARs and RXRs, involves the binding and recruitment of
coactivators and/or mediators to target gene promoters. One
component of the TRAP-Mediator complex, TRAP220 (the
thyroid hormone receptor–associated protein, also known
as ARC/DRIP205), is directly associated with the thyroid
receptor, vitamin D receptor, and PPAR and facilitates
NR-mediated transcription. Recent studies have further
shown a functional role of TRAP220 in the optimal vitamin
D receptor– and retinoic acid receptor–mediated myelomonocytic differentiation processes in hematopoietic cells (3).
It was also found to act as a pivotal coactivator for GATA-1
in erythroid development (4) and has been shown to play a
role in differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes in
response to vitamin D receptor stimulation (5, 6).

PPARγ ligands have been extensively investigated and are
known to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation or
apoptosis in different cancer cell types, including hematologic malignancies (7). Our studies have shown that PPARγ ligands alone or in combination with RXR-specific activators
can inhibit clonal proliferation and induce differentiation of
HL-60, U937, and THP1 human myeloid leukemic cell lines
(8). 2-Cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO),
a synthetic triterpenoid, is a ligand for PPARγ (9) that induces growth arrest, apoptosis, and/or differentiation of a variety of tumor cell types. We have shown that CDDO induces
Bcl-2 downregulation, mitochondrial depolarization, and caspase activation in myeloid leukemic cells (10). It also potently
enhances apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor in myeloid leukemia cells (11) and refractory chronic lymphocytic
leukemia B cells (12). In breast cancer, CDDO-induced
growth inhibition correlates with PPARγ transactivation
and is mediated, at least in part, by upregulation of P21 and
downregulation of cyclin D1 (13, 14). Notably, CDDO and its
derivatives also induce differentiation of leukemic cells (15–
17), effects that in some cell types are synergistically enhanced
by concomitant ligation of the RXR nuclear receptor. The
multiple effects of CDDOs have been attributed to both
PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent mechanisms of
action (18). One of the most powerful anti-inflammatory
and anticarcinogenic activities induced by CDDO and related
compounds is activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway,
a major regulator of antioxidant cellular responses (for
review, see ref. 19).
In this study, we investigated the role of PPARγ and its
coactivator DRIP205 on the apoptosis- and differentiationinducing properties of CDDO in leukemic cells. The results
show that the PPARγ ligands CDDO and 15-deoxy- 12,14 15DPGJ2 (15d15DPGJ2) induce higher degrees of apoptosis in
leukemic cells modified to overexpress PPARγ. Furthermore,
we provide evidence that overexpression and recruitment of
the coactivator DRIP205 contributes to the enhanced differentiation by this agent. Finally, we report induction of
myeloid differentiation of PPARγ/DRIP205–coexpressing
leukemic blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) treated with CDDO (RTA-401) in a “first-in-man”
clinical trial.

anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies were from Bio-Rad.
Cell lines and primary AML samples
HL-60, U937, MCF-7, and SW480 were purchased from The
American Type Culture Collection. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 260 AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) samples were assessed for PPARγ
expression by reverse-phase protein array (Supplementary
Methods; ref. 22). Samples were collected for the Leukemia
Sample Bank at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between January 15, 1998 and March 9, 2006, on
Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved protocol Lab01473, and consent was obtained according to the Declaration
of Helsinki. Samples were analyzed under an IRB-approved
laboratory protocol (Lab05-0654).
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle
Early apoptotic events were detected by the flow cytometric measurement of externalized phosphatidylserine with
the Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit from Roche Diagnostics.
Cell cycle analysis was conducted using propidium iodide as
described (23).
DNA fragmentation assay
Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in lysis
buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.025% Triton
X-100, pH 8.0) for 10 to 20 minutes on ice. Lysates were digested with RNase A (50 μg/mL) and then with proteinase K
(2 mg/mL) for 1 hour each at 37°C. DNA samples were separated on 1.8% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and
visualized by UV light.
Differentiation assay
The differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells was determined by their ability to produce superoxide, as measured
by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) as described
(24). The analysis of differentiation-specific cell surface antigens was measured by flow cytometry using the PE-conjugated
anti-CD11b and FITC-conjugated anti-CD14 monoclonal
antibodies.

were generated by PCR (25). FLAG-tagged wild-type (wt)
PPARγ construct was kindly provided by Dr. K. Chatterjee
(Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom). pcDNA3-DRIP205 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Leonard P. Freedman (Merck
Research Laboratories, West Point, PA).
For transient transfection assays, SW480 cells were
cotransfected with DNA using FuGENE. In coactivation
experiments, cells were cotransfected with 250 ng of SV40
β-galactosidase (used as an internal control) and 1 μg of
the reporter construct containing three copies of the acylCoA oxidase PPARγ response element (PPRE) cloned
upstream of the TK-LUC reporter, PPREx3-LUC reporter
(kindly provided by Dr. Ronald M. Evans, The Salk Institute,
La Jolla, CA), and various amounts of DRIP205 or deletion
mutant constructs. After 24 hours, transfected cells were
treated with DMSO or 0.75 μmol/L CDDO for another 48
to 72 hours. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by
dividing luciferase activity by β-galactosidase activity for
each well.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed at a density of 1 × 106/50 μL in protein
lysis buffer (0.25 mol/L Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecylsulfate,
4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol
blue) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostic). For preparation of nuclear lysates, cells
were washed in cold PBS and digitonin-permeabilized for
5 minutes on ice at a density of 20 million cells/mL in extraction buffer (250 mmol/L sucrose, 70 mmol/L KCl; 137
mmol/L NaCl; 4.3 mmol/L Na2HPO4; 1.4 mmol/L KH2PO4
(pH 7.2), 200 μg/mL digitonin, and protease inhibitors).
Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C,
and pellet containing nuclear fraction was lysed as above.
Cell lysates were then loaded onto a 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE
gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech), followed by immunoblotting. Signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, version 4.0,
Molecular Dynamics).
Clinical trial of CDDO in patients with AML
Patients with refractory/relapsed AML were treated with
CDDO (RTA-401, Reata Pharmaceuticals) from 0.6 to 75
mg/m2/h × 5 days, in a phase 1 clinical trial, following informed consent according to the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center and Princess Margaret HospitalOntario Cancer Institute guidelines (Supplementary Table
S1). Bone marrow or peripheral blood sample mononuclear
cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Chemical)
density-gradient centrifugation. Apoptosis was examined
by simultaneous staining with CD34 allophycocyanin
(APC; BD) and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM;
Invitrogen) to measure mitochondrial inner transmembrane
potential (Δψ m ). Cell differentiation was examined by
simultaneous staining with CD34-APC (BD), CD33-PE-Cy7
(BD), CD14-FITC (BD), and CD11b-PE (BD) at the indicated
time points.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples obtained from
AML patients were lysed with RNA Stat 60 (Tel-Test). The
RNA was subjected to purification in an RNeasy ionexchange column (Qiagen) with on-column DNase treatment.
cDNA was prepared from 1.0 μg of total RNA per 20 μL of
mix containing 0.07 μg/μL random-sequence hexamer primers, 0.5 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 5 mmol/L
DTT, 0.2 units/μL SuperAsin RNase inhibitor (Ambion),
and 10 units/μL SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
was carried out using an ABI Prism 7700 instrument as
described (26). For primer and probe sets to detect PPARγ,
p21, NQO1, and housekeeping gene ABL1, we used TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays Hs00234592_m1, Hs00355782_m1,
Hs00168547_m1, and Hs00245445_m1, respectively. The
abundance of each transcript of interest relative to that of
ABL1 was calculated as follows: relative expression = 100 ×
2 exp [−ΔCt], where ΔCt is the mean Ct of the transcript
of interest less the mean Ct of the transcript for ABL.
Transfection of PPARγ small interfering RNA
Cells were transfected by the Amaxa electroporator Nucleofector I from Amaxa Biosystems, using the Nucleofector
Kit C (program W-001). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
PPARγ transfection was performed using validated Stealth
RNAi VHS 40941 for duplex 1 (siRNA1) and VHS 40944 for
duplex 2 (siRNA2; Invitrogen). Cells (106) were resuspended
in 100 μL of Nucleofector Solution C and transfected by electroporation with scramble LO GC Duplex Stealth RNAi Negative Control (12 935-200; Invitrogen) or with PPARγ
siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, DMSO or CDDO
was added to the cells for 24 hours, and protein expression
was monitored by immunoblotting.

Results
PPARγ protein expression in AML
We have previously shown that PPARγ protein is expressed in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines
(8). Expression of PPARγ protein was analyzed in 260 newly
diagnosed leukemia-enriched AML/MDS samples. PPARγ
protein was variably expressed in different AML subtypes
(Supplementary Fig. S1). There was no difference in overall
survival between patients expressing high or low levels
PPARγ (not shown).
CDDO induces PPARγ activation in AML cells
We next characterized the relationship between PPARγ expression and the ability of pharmacologic PPARγ ligands to
affect the growth and survival of leukemic cells. To this end,
we established stable transfectants of U937 cells expressing
empty vector (pcDNA3) or Flag-tagged wt-PPARγ (Fig. 1A–C).
Overexpression of PPARγ facilitated growth of cells but the
differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.1;
Supplementary Fig. S2A). Exposure of cells to the PPARγ ligand
CDDO further enhanced PPARγ protein expression in both vector
control and transfected cells (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, CDDO
induced PPARγ mRNA expression wt-PPARγ–overexpressing

and PPARγ protein levels were examined by immunocytochemistry. D, PPARγ transcript was measured in wt-PPARγ–transfected cells (clone 1) or in the

cells or in the same cells transfected with scrambled siRNA
(2.3- and 3-fold, respectively), and this induction was largely
abrogated in PPARγ siRNA–transfected cells. These data suggest that PPARγ ligation with CDDO induces expression of its
cognate receptor in a PPARγ-dependent fashion.
Relationship between PPARγ expression and growth
inhibitory responses to PPARγ agonists
Next, we examined the functional consequences of PPARγ
induction and overexpression in response to the receptor activation by CDDO or by the structurally different PPARγ
agonist 15dPGJ2. Vector control (pcDNA3) or wt-PPARγ–
transfected U937 cells were treated with 1 μmol/L CDDO
for 24 hours. Overexpression of PPARγ significantly enhanced the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptosis induced
by CDDO or 15dPGJ2 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2B).
We next analyzed modulation of apoptosis and cell cycle–
regulating proteins in PPARγ-transfected clones. Following
treatment with CDDO for 24 hours, cells overexpressing
wt-PPARγ exhibited significantly decreased procaspase-3

and increased cleavage of caspase-3 and its substrate PARP
(Fig. 2B). In accordance with these results, CDDO induced a
higher degree of endonucleolytic DNA cleavage in PPARγoverexpressing cells. Analysis of the upstream (initiator) caspases showed the appearance of the active (p18) fragment of
caspase-8 in these cells, whereas caspase-9 was similarly
cleaved in both vector control and PPARγ-overexpressing cells
(Fig. 2B). In a time-course experiment, no caspase-8 cleavage
and DNA fragmentation were observed in vector-treated cells,
whereas both ligands induced caspase-8 cleavage and DNA
fragmentation at 5 and 24 hours in PPARγ-overexpressing
cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, caspase-9 cleavage did not substantially differ between control and PPARγ-transfected cells.
Activation of caspase-8 may proceed through CHOP-dependent
transcriptional upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR5)/tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor
2 (TRAIL-R2) triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress and
unfolded protein response (27), and CDDO slightly increased
the level of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker protein
Bip/GRP78 in PPARγ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B). Knocking

down exogenously transfected PPARγ by two different
siRNA constructs abolished apoptosis induced by lower
CDDO concentration (0.5 μmol/L) but did not significantly
affect it at higher CDDO concentration (1 μmol/L; Fig. 2D),
indicating the contribution of PPARγ-dependent and
PPARγ-independent mechanisms of cell death. Likewise,
the pharmacologic PPARγ inhibitor T007 partially protected
PPARγ-overexpressing cells, but not control cells, from

CDDO-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2C). CDDO
potently induced expression of the stress-responsive inducible
enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1; Fig. 2B) and of one of the
critical Nrf2 target genes, NADPH quinine oxidoreductase-1
(NQO1; Supplementary Fig. S3A), in both control and PPARγoverexpressing cells.

cycle inhibitory protein p21Waf1/CIP1, and we have previously

DNA fragmentation were determined. C, caspase-8 and caspase-9 processing and DNA fragmentation at 5 and 24 h were measured. D, U937-wt-PPARγ
cells were transiently transfected with scrambled or PPARγ siRNA (siRNA1 and siRNA2) at a final concentration of 67 nmol/L. Seventy-two hours after
transfection, cells were exposed to indicated concentrations of CDDO for 24 h. Induction of apoptosis was measured by Annexin V flow cytometry. Columns,

shown that CDDO induced p21 mRNA and protein in breast
cancer cells (14). Consistent with these findings, CDDO induced p21 mRNA in leukemic cells (Fig. 3A). This increase
in P21 transcription was evident both in control cells and in
cells overexpressing PPARγ (Fig. 3A and B). The expression of
p27KIP1 was unchanged, and no significant differences in cell
cycle distribution were noted between PPARγ-overexpressing
and control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Although P21
promoter contains a potential conserved consensus PPRE,
CDDO may also increase transcription of P21 indirectly
through increased binding of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription
factors to the GC-rich regions of the P21 promoter. To determine the mechanism of transcriptional activation of P21 by
CDDO, we conducted promoter assays by transient transfection of SW480 cells expressing endogenous PPARγ (Fig. 3C,
inset) with full-length P21 luciferase promoter plasmid and
plasmids containing point mutations in GC-rich elements 1
to 6 (Mut1–Mut6) of the proximal P21 promoter (28). CDDO
induced an ∼6-fold increase in P21-wt promoter activity
(Fig. 3C, p21-Luc wt). Interestingly, CDDO was capable of
transactivating all constructs containing point mutations.

Cancer Res; 70(12) June 15, 2010

To determine if CDDO induces p21 expression via PPARγ,
we measured p21 levels following depletion of PPARγ by
siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3D, inhibition of PPARγ using siRNA
failed to block CDDO-induced levels of p21 mRNA or protein
expression. These data indicate that CDDO causes induction
of p21 levels in a PPARγ-independent fashion. Consistent
with documented properties of triterpenoids and other
electrophilic compounds to activate the Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, CDDO robustly induced HO-1 (Fig. 3D)
and NQO1 (Supplementary Fig. S3B) in cells with functional
or silenced PPARγ, indicating that these responses are likewise PPARγ independent. No appreciable change in Bip/
GRP78 expression was noted in control or transfected cells
(Fig. 3D), indicating no significant contribution of endoplasmic
reticulum stress to the proapoptotic effects of CDDO in this
cell system.

mediate tissue-specific effects (29). To ascertain whether
DRIP205 overexpression will affect the transcriptional activity
of PPARγ, the ability of CDDO and 15dPGJ2 to induce (PPRE)
3-tk-luc reporter was examined in MCF-7 cells transfected
with full-length DRIP205 plasmid. Transient cotransfection
with (PPRE)3-tk-luc reporter and full-length pcDNA3DRIP205 plasmid resulted in higher levels of PPARγ transactivation induced by 15dPGJ2 and CDDO (1.9- and 2.7-fold,
respectively; Fig. 4A).
Previous studies have shown that the NR boxes in DRIP205/
TRAP220 contribute to the physical and functional interactions of these coactivators with NRs (30, 31). Their role in
coactivation of PPARγ was further investigated in SW480 cotransfected with (PPRE)3-tk-luc reporter and NH2- or COOHterminal GAL4-DRIP205 deletion constructs (Fig. 4B). The
full-length DRIP205 expression plasmid encodes for
1,566 amino acids, which are identical to amino acids 16–
1,581 of the TRAP220 coding sequence. CDDO significantly
induced activity in cells transfected with (PPRE)3-tk-luc
and GAL4-DRIP205 (wild-type). In addition, significant coactivation, albeit to a lesser degree, was observed for several
GAL4-DRIP205 chimeras (pMDm5, pMDm7, pMDm7Δ, and
pMDm6), two of which express NH2-terminal (pMDm5) or
COOH-terminal (pMDm6) regions of DRIP205 but do not con-

tain the central NR box sequences (Fig. 4C). These results confirm that the NR boxes of DRIP205 may contribute to, but are
not required for, coactivation and indicate that multiple domains of DRIP205 are involved in interactions with PPARγ.
DRIP205 contributes to myelomonocytic
differentiation of leukemic cells in response to CDDO
To determine the functional role of DRIP205 in the
context of PPARγ ligation in leukemic cells, we investigated the effects of CDDO in HL-60 cells stably transfected
with DRIP205 plasmid (three separate clones; Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S4A). No difference in cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S4B), cell cycle progression (Supplementary
Fig. S4C), or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S4D) was found
in cells overexpressing DRIP205, cultured alone or exposed
to CDDO. In contrast, CDDO induced a higher degree of
myelomonocytic differentiation in DRIP205-overexpressing
cells as shown by increased expression of CD11b (P < 0.01;
Fig. 5B) and by NBT assay (36.7 ± 6.1% versus 79.7 ± 4.7%, P <
0.001; Fig. 5C).
To determine if the enhanced differentiation was mediated through PPARγ, we assessed CD11b expression in
cells pretreated with the pharmacologic PPARγ antagonist
T007. As shown in Fig. 5D, blocking PPARγ transactivation

CDDO induces expression of markers of differentiation
and apoptosis in leukemic blasts of patients
treated in phase I clinical trial
In a first-in-man clinical phase I trial of increasing doses
of CDDO (RTA-401; escalated from 0.6 to 75 mg/m2/h) in
patients with relapsed/refractory AML, we investigated the
in vivo differentiating and proapoptotic effects of CDDO

and correlated these changes with PPARγ and DRIP205 expression in cells from nine patients by quantitative TaqMan
PCR (PPARγ) and immunoblotting (PPARγ and DRIP205).
Clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. PPARγ mRNA was expressed in
all samples at baseline albeit at different levels. PPARγ and
DRIP205 proteins were expressed in samples from seven of
nine patients studied; no expression of either protein was detected in samples from patients #307 and #309 (Fig. 6A). After
6 days of continuous CDDO administration, PPARγ mRNA
was induced >2-fold in four patient samples (Supplementary

and CD14+ cells and a concomitant reduction of immature
cells expressing CD34 or CD33 were observed (#301, #304,
#305, and #306, Fig. 6B). Examples of flow cytometric profiles
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. Baseline expression of
PPARγ protein was highest in samples from patients #301
and #304 (Fig. 6A), and in all four patients increase in PPARγ
mRNA was shown (1.5-, 2.4-, 1.8-, and 2.2-fold, respectively;
Supplementary Table S2). In these, p21 mRNA was induced
>2-fold in samples #304, #305, and #306. No change in
differentiation markers was observed in patients #307 and
#309 with no detectable baseline PPARγ or DRIP205 proteins. Moderate induction of apoptosis, documented as loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential in circulating CD34+
cells, was observed in samples from three patients (#301,
#303, and #305); in sample #303, corresponding apoptosis induction was seen in day 6 bone marrow CD34+ cells (Fig. 6C).
Examples of flow cytometric profiles are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. Clinically, patients did not fulfill protocol response
criteria: differential counts did not change significantly and
maximum tolerated dose was not reached at the low dose
levels in this phase I study.

Discussion
PPARγ ligands inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce
apoptosis and/or differentiation in multiple tumor types, and
these effects have been attributed to both PPARγ-dependent
and PPARγ-independent mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the role of PPARγ and one of its cellular coactivators,
DRIP205, in the proapoptotic and differentiating properties
of PPARγ agonists CDDO and 15dPGJ2. A high-throughput
reverse-phase protein array technique showed high levels of
PPARγ expression in 260 primary AML samples. To functionally characterize the relationship between baseline PPARγ
levels and cellular effects of PPARγ agonists in leukemic
cells, we generated stably transfected myeloid leukemic cells
overexpressing the receptor. U937 cells induced to overexpress wt-PPARγ were more sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of PPARγ ligands CDDO and 15dPGJ2 compared with
vector-transduced cells. These proapoptotic effects were significantly inhibited by silencing PPARγ with siRNA or by
blocking PPARγ activation with the pharmacologic antagonist T007, consistent with previously published findings of
PPARγ-dependent and PPARγ-independent mechanisms of
action of this class of agents. Time-course analysis showed
that high PPARγ levels facilitated cleavage of caspase8 and caspase-3 (but not of caspase-9), resulting in accelerated PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. Of
note, several reports indicated the ability of CDDOs to activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and sensitize to TRAIL
via diverse molecular mechanisms including FLIP downregulation (32), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase–mediated induction of
TRAIL receptor expression (33), and inhibition of NF-κB–
dependent antiapoptotic proteins (11). Conversely, data
reported by us and others show that CDDO and its more
potent derivative CDDO-Me promoted the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria, suggesting that CDDOs

www.aacrjournals.org

directly target the mitochondria to trigger the intrinsic pathway of cell death (34, 35). Data presented here suggest a proximal role for caspase-8 downstream of ligand-activated
PPARγ, whereas direct mitochondrial effects of CDDO observed at higher concentrations are likely PPARγ independent, possibly by modifying the mitochondrial proteins
through nucleophilic attack and Michaels addition (36). Unlike in non–small lung cancer cells (27). CDDO did not induce
significant endoplasmic reticulum stress response, hence
making upregulation of DR5 an unlikely mechanism of
caspase-8 activation. The exact mechanistic link between
PPARγ transactivation and activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in AML remains to be determined.
It has recently been shown that synthetic triterpenoids are
potent activators of Nrf2/ARE signaling in a variety of cell
types, resulting in marked induction of a variety of antioxidative genes and detoxifying enzymes (37–39). In our studies,
CDDO promptly upregulated expression of HO-1 and NQO1 in
leukemia cells engineered to overexpress or silence PPARγ.
These observations are consistent with the notion that these
responses are likely mediated by the chemical structure of
CDDO and other electrophilic compounds capable of modifying cysteine residues on KEAP1 protein (37) and represent important PPARγ-independent activities of this class of
compounds.
PPARγ agonists including CDDO modulate cell cycle progression in multiple tumor types (13, 14). Our present data
show that CDDO induced expression of p21waf1/CIP protein
in leukemic cells. This induction was observed in parental
cells, in cells overexpressing PPARγ, or in cells transfected
with PPARγ siRNA. These findings indicate that the ability
of CDDO to activate P21 promoter is likely mediated via
PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Because induction of p21
expression is frequently mediated via increased binding of
Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription factors to the GC-rich regions
of the P21 promoter, we used the constructs containing point
mutations in the GC elements. In contrast to our previous
study in pancreatic cells (40), we were unable to identify the
specific site required for PPARγ-dependent activation of P21.
Of note, p21 is regulated by many different pathways and
transcription factors, and CDDO could conceivably mediate
its effects on p21 expression through an alternate pathway.
Surprisingly, induction of p21 protein expression did not
translate into a discernible cell cycle arrest in leukemic cells.
The observation that CDDO preferentially induces apoptosis
rather than cell cycle arrest in AML cells attests to the cell
type–dependent properties of these agents, likely related to
the distinct mitochondrial architecture of leukemic cells compared with solid tumor cells. Whether functional consequences of p21 overexpression other than control of cell
cycle, such as regulation of apoptosis, differentiation, or transcriptional activation (41), are operational in leukemic cells
remains to be investigated. Notably, p21 mRNA induction
was observed in samples from three of the nine patients treated with very low doses of CDDO (RTA-401) in a phase I
clinical trial.
Emerging evidence suggests the critical importance of
the cellular context, in particular the composition of

tissue-specific coactivators and corepressors, in the biological responses to NR agonists. PPARγ is known to interact with both the p160/SRC-1 family of coactivators and
the multisubunit DRIP/Mediator coactivator complex. Our

results show that CDDO induced significant activity in
cells transfected with (PPRE)3-tk-luc and full-length
DRIP205. In addition, significant coactivation was observed
using several NH2- and COOH-terminal domain mutants of

for immunoblotting. B, patients were treated with CDDO (RTA-401) during a phase I clinical trial, and cells were collected from the PB or BM and assessed
for expression of surface markers CD11b, CD14, CD33, and CD34 by flow cytometry at the indicated time points (see also Supplementary Table S2).

DRIP205, and this coactivation did not require the NR boxes
(Fig. 4B). These results suggest that multiple domains of
DRIP205 are involved in interactions with PPARγ, similar to
findings reported for estrogen receptor-α coactivation by
DRIP205 (25). Interestingly, recent structural and functional
analyses indicate that a direct interaction of PPARγ with
DRIP/Mediator complex through the NR motifs of DRIP205
is not required for PPARγ-stimulated adipogenesis (42).
DRIP205 is involved in the vitamin D–triggered regulation
of gene transcription during keratinocyte differentiation (6),
and overexpression of DRIP205 was observed in some cancer
cell lines (43). CDDOs have been shown to induce differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells (16, 17, 44), and in this study,
CDDO induced a higher degree of myelomonocytic differentiation in DRIP205-overexpressing HL-60 cells, a process mediated through PPARγ. Whereas we recently reported that
one of the mechanisms of differentiation induction by CDDO
involves modulation of CEBPα expression and function (45),
our data shown here provide first evidence that high cellular
levels of the coactivator DRIP205 can enhance the differentiation induced by PPARγ ligation and is therefore an important determinant of tissue-specific effects of PPARγ agonists.
We here report that leukemic blasts from patients treated in
a phase I clinical trial of CDDO (RTA-401) express DRIP205
in seven of nine samples, all of which expressed PPARγ
mRNA and protein. Further, sequential studies showed
increased expression of the differentiation markers CD11b
and/or CD14 in four patients. In these patients, CDDO
induced PPARγ transcription. Although the numbers are
too small to draw definitive conclusions, the data suggest
that CDDO activates PPARγ in a subset of patients with
AML in vivo, whose cells express DRIP205. We did not
observe correlation between PPARγ levels and apoptosis

induction, possibly due to very low levels of CDDO in this
phase I study. Alternatively, this finding may indicate that
PPARγ-dependent functions of CDDO may manifest primarily through differentiation induction rather than apoptotic
responses in primary AML cells. Recently, the RXR agonist
bexarotene was shown to induce differentiation in non–
acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with AML who were
treated with this agent in a phase I trial (46). Taking into
consideration multiple studies showing that addition of
RXR ligands synergistically enhances the differentiating and
growth-suppressive effects of PPARγ ligands (8, 47), the
combined use of these agents seems to be worth testing in
the therapy of AML. The ongoing efforts by the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas consortium to profile coactivators/
corepressors in primary AML may assist in identifying patients who are likely to benefit from PPARγ/RXR ligation
strategies.
