BACKGROUND. A prospective, single-arm, open-label, nonrandomized Phase 2
study of combined fludarabine and mitoxantrone (FM) plus radioimmunotherapy
was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients with untreated, indolent, nonfollicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

METHODS. Between February 2005 and June 2006, at their institute, the authors
treated 26 eligible patients with previously untreated, indolent, nonfollicular NHL
(10 marginal zone lymphomas, 8 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, and 8 small
lymphocytic lymphomas) using a novel regimen that consisted of 6 cycles of FM
chemotherapy followed 6 to 10 weeks later by yttrium-90 (90Y) ibritumomab
tiuxetan.

RESULTS. After FM chemotherapy, the overall response rate was 80.5% and

at the end of the entire treatment regimen. At a median follow-up of 20 months,
the estimated 3-year progression-free survival rate was 89.5%, and the estimated
3-year overall survival rate was 100%. The 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan toxicity
included grade 3 hematologic toxicity in 16 of 20 patients; the most common
grade 3 toxicities were neutropenia (11 patients) and thrombocytopenia (16
patients) (adverse events were graded according to the World Health Organization criteria for toxicity). Transfusions of erythrocytes and/or platelets were given
to 5 patients.

(MALT) lymphomas, which can be cured by surgery, local radiotherapy, or antibiotic treatment,1–3 indolent, nonfollicular nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL) generally are regarded as incurable.
Studies from Stanford in the 1970s indicated that there was
no difference in freedom from disease progression or survival
between 4 different approaches to treatment—namely, single-agent,
alkylating agent therapy; whole-body irradiation, combined

cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone
(CVP) chemotherapy; and CVP plus total lymphoid
irradiation.4,5 The Stanford group also reported that
patients with indolent, nonfollicular NHL did not
necessarily need to start treatment as soon as a diagnosis was made and that a ‘‘watch-and-wait’’ policy
in selected groups of patients did not lead to an inferior outcome for these individuals.6 This conservative
approach is particularly applicable to elderly patients
(the majority), who usually are less tolerant to drug
toxicity.
In the last decade, fludarabine has emerged as
one of the most active agents available for the treatment of indolent NHL. Although early trials using
single-agent fludarabine produced overall response
rates that ranged from 30% to 50% in previously treated patients,7–10 more recent efforts have focused on
combining fludarabine with other agents, especially
mitoxantrone,11–16 idarubicin,17–19 cyclophosphamide,20–22 and a combination of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone.23,24 Phase 2 trials
using these combination regimens have yielded reproducible overall response rates from 40% to 70%,
which appear to be superior to the rates reported
with single-agent fludarabine.
With regard to the role of rituximab in patients
with indolent, nonfollicular NHL, to our knowledge
its efficacy is not well known because there have
been conflicting results. In a European trial in
patients with recurrent indolent, nonfollicular NHL,
the efficacy of rituximab was lower than that
reported in patients with follicular NHL, with
response rates ranging between 14% and 38%,
depending on the histologic subtype.25 However, in
untreated patients, the response rate reportedly was
higher.26 In a Phase 2 study, Hainsworth et al.26
reported a 51% response rate after 4 administrations
with only a 4% complete remission (CR) rate.
Radioimmunotherapy has emerged as an important treatment option for patients with B-cell NHL.
Yttrium-90 (90Y) ibritumomab is a murine monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 j antibody to CD20, which
is a surface antigen that is expressed on 90% of Bcell lymphomas,27 and is conjugated to the metal
chelator tiuxetan for retention of the b emitter 90Y
for therapy. Thus, treatment with 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan targets radiation to B-cell lymphomas,
which inherently are sensitive to radiation.28
In the initial Phase 1/2 trial of 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan, responses were observed in 82% of 34
patients with indolent NHL, including a CR in 26%
of patietns.29 Witzig et al. compared 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan with standard-dose rituximab in a randomized, controlled, Phase 3 study30 in patients with

857

recurrent or refractory, indolent, follicular NHL
and reported statistically significantly higher overall
response and CR rates. Other investigators have
reported additional data that tends to confirm the
safety and activeness of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in
patients with follicular NHL.31,32 In view of these
findings, we decided to investigate the efficacy and
safety of a novel approach combining induction
chemotherapy with fludarabine and mitoxantrone
(FM) chemotherapy followed by consolidation with
90
Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in a Phase 2 trial for
patients with previously untreated, nonfollicular
NHL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients aged 18 years with biopsy-proven,
untreated, bidimensionally measurable, stage II, III,
or IV (graded according to the Ann Arbor Staging
System), indolent nonfollicular (small lymphocytic,
lymphoplasmacytic, and marginal zone lymphoma)
NHL that expressed the CD20 antigen were eligible
for this trial if they had a World Health Organization
(WHO) performance status of 0 to 2. All patients
were notified of the investigational nature of this
study and signed a written informed-consent for that
was approved in accordance with institutional guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board. All diagnostic biopsies were reviewed by an
expert pathologist (Stefano Pileri) from our institute
to confirm the diagnosis of indolent, nonfollicular
lymphoma according to the WHO classification.33
Baseline Studies
All patients who entered this trial were required to
undergo a full history; physical examination; complete blood cell count with leukocyte differential; platelet count; computed tomography (CT) scans of the
neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and bone marrow
aspiration and biopsy. According to good medical
practice, patients also were tested for blood chemistry (including creatinine, liver function tests, uric
acid, and lactate dehydrogenase) and underwent urinalysis and electrocardiography. Patients who had a
history of impaired cardiac status were assessed by
echocardiograph and were eligible only if their cardiac ejection fraction was normal.
Treatment Plan
Patients received standard FM chemotherapy every
28 days for 6 cycles with dosages of 25 mg/m2 of fludarabine on Days 1 through 3 and 10 mg/m2 of

858

mitoxantrone on Day 1 (both drugs were administered intravenously). Allopurinol (300 mg orally) was
recommended as adjunctive therapy for patients
with bulky disease. If patients had a granulocyte
count <1500/lL or a platelet count <100,000/lL by
the start of the next cycle, then treatment was
delayed for 1 week, and counts were repeated. If
counts had not recovered after 2 weeks, then the
patient received at 75% of the last dose of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin received. Re-escalation
was at the discretion of the treating physician.
Growth-stimulating factors were not administered to
prevent neutropenia, but patients who experienced
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or who developed neutropenic fever between cycles of chemotherapy were
allowed to receive growth factors for subsequent
cycles of therapy at the discretion of the treating
physician.

Restaging
Patients were restaged from 4 to 6 weeks after they
completed the sixth cycle of FM chemotherapy by
physical examination, blood testing, CT scans, and
bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Patients who
achieved at least a partial response after 6 cycles of
FM were eligible for consolidation with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan provided their granulocyte count was
>1500/lL granulocytes, their platelet count was
>100,000/lL, and their bone marrow examination at
the completion of FM chemotherapy had 25%
involvement with lymphoma.
Six to 10 weeks after completing the sixth cycle
of FM chemotherapy, eligible patients received 1
course of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (Fig. 1), which
consisted of an initial infusion of rituximab at a dose
of 250 mg/m2 on Day 1 and another on Day 7, 8, or
9; a second infusion of rituximab at a dose of 250
mg/m2 was followed by a weight-based dose of 90Y
ibritumomab tiuxetan (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) given as a slow intravenous push over 10 min-

utes. The dose of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was 11.1
megabecquerels (MBq)/kg (0.3 mCi/kg) in patients
with pretreatment platelet counts from 100,000 to
149,000/lL and 14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) in patients
with pretreatment platelet counts 150,000/lL. In all
patients, the maximum total dose was 1184 MBq (32
mCi). 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was administered
routinely on an outpatient basis because of the lack
of g emissions.
Disease status was evaluated with a physical examination; a bone marrow biopsy; and CT scans of
the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis along with
other clinically relevant tests. This assessment was
repeated 3 months after 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan
infusion.
Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring the incidence, severity, and type of any adverse
event. Adverse events were graded according to the
WHO criteria for toxicity. Responses were classified
according to the International Working Group
Response Criteria.34

Statistical Analysis
Sample size estimation was performed by using the
Fleming single-stage procedure.35,36 Previous experience has demonstrated that the response rate
(adjusted for the response criteria as par) is 50%. By
defining p0 as the proportion of responses below
which treatment does not warrant further investigation and defining pa as the proportion of responses
beyond which a Phase 3 trial should be performed,
we set p0 5 0.5 and pa 5 0.8. According to this calculation, the number of patients required is 18 given a
type I error (a) of .05 (2-sided) and a power of 1b 5 80%, and the number of successes (responses)
required is 13. If, by the end of the trial, at least 13
responses (successes) are observed, then the treatment will be accepted for a Phase 3 trial.37 Overall
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)
curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier
method.38 PFS was defined as the time from registration to the first observation of progressive disease or
death from any cause.

III disease, 22 patients had stage IV disease (22
patients had bone marrow involvement), and 2
patients (8%) had bulky disease.

Clinical Response
At the evaluation after 6 cycles of FM chemotherapy,
the overall response rate was 80.5%: Thirteen
patients (50%) were in CR, 8 patients (30.5%) were in
PR, and the remaining 5 patients were considered
nonresponders. According to histology, the 5 nonresponders had 2 small lymphocytic leukemia,
2 patients had lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and
1 patient had marginal zone lymphoma.
Twenty of 26 patients were evaluable for 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment, including all patients
who achieved CR and 7 patients who achieved PR
(the remaining patient who achieved PR had a small
lymphocytic lymphoma and was excluded from the
second part of the therapy program because of bone
marrow infiltration >25%). There is no record of any
patient receiving a reduced dose of 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan because of persisting thrombocytopenia after FM. The median time from the initiation of
Course 6 of chemotherapy to the initiation of radioimmunotherapy was 8 weeks.
The overall response rate of the 20 patients who
completed the entire treatment regimen (FM plus 90Y
ibritumomab tiuxetan) was 100%, and the CR rate
was 100%. Therapy with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan

improved the CR rate substantially (Table 2). In all
7 patients (100%) who initially achieved PR on the
FM regimen alone, the addition of 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan improved the overall best response (from PR
to CR). With a median follow-up of 20 months
(range, 12–39 months), 2 eligible patients experienced disease progression, resulting in an estimated
3-year PFS rate of 89.5% (Fig. 2). One patient died
because of lymphoma progression; the 3-year OS
estimate was 100% (Fig. 2).

Safety
There were no treatment-related deaths. The FM regimen was tolerated well by most patients. Reversible
hematologic toxicities constituted most of the
adverse events, including grade 4 hematologic toxicity in 5 patients (19%) and grade 3 hematologic toxicity in 13 patients (50%). We observed that all
of these patients presented with neutropenia. Only
1 patient (4%) developed febrile neutropenia.
With regard to 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan, there
were no infusion-related reactions. Adverse events af-

ter 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment were primarily hematologic and transient; and no patient discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.
The duration of hematologic toxicity is listed in Table 3. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 16
of 20 patients (61.5%), grade 3 and 4 neutropenia
occurred in 11 of 20 patients (42%), and grade 3 and 4
anemia occurred in 7 of 20 patients (27%). In terms of
the median duration (in days) of nadir with grade 3
and 4 hematologic toxicity, the data indicated that anemia and thrombocytopenia were longer lasting than
what is observed normally in patients with aggressive
lymphoma. Four patients (15%) received granulocyte
colony-stimulating factors, 3 patients (11.5%) received
platelet transfusions, and 5 patients (19%) received
erythrocyte transfusions. Only 1 patient (4%) experienced febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization. No
patients developed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels or any secondary malignancies.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we established the feasibility, tolerability,
and efficacy of sequential treatment with 6 cycles of
FM chemotherapy followed by 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan as front-line therapy for patients with untreated, indolent, nonfollicular NHL. In particular, to our
knowledge, the data represent the first demonstration
in the literature of the real role of 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan in the treatment of indolent nonfollicular NHL.
The clinical evaluation of immunotherapy based
on anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has affected
the treatment approach markedly for patients with
indolent nonfollicular NHL.25,26 At the same time,
the fluorinated nucleotide analog fludarabine is a
potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis and has demonstrated activity in indolent NHL both as a single
agent and in combination with other agents.11,39 In
parallel, radioimmunotherapy with 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan has been developed and has been proven to

be among the most active agents in lymphoma therapy. Its toxicity is manageable and consists primarily
of transient myelosuppression in addition to typical
antibody-associated infusion reactions. Clinical trials
with this agent have demonstrated significant activity
in indolent NHL,29,30,32 including disease that is resistant to chemotherapy or rituximab.31 The data
have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of
patients can have durable remissions, extending in
some patients >5 years. On the basis of these data,
further investigations have monitored radioimmunotherapy as consolidation after initial treatment
with chemotherapy40,41 in patients with follicular
NHL. Initial reports from those indicate acceptable
toxicity with promising antilymphoma activity, and
randomized studies are in progress in indolent, follicular NHL. The principal challenge when it comes
to applying these radiolabeled immunotherapies is
how to integrate them into the treatment approach
in the most effective manner. The finding that radioimmunotherapy has demonstrated the highest
response rate of any ‘‘single-agent’’ approach in lymphoma therapy highlights the potential importance
of this therapeutic modality.
The reason we decided to conduct this sequential treatment trial using conventional chemotherapy
followed by radioimmunotherapy (90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan) was to test its degree of activity and its
safety in this particular subset of patients with indolent, nonfollicular NHL in which conventional chemotherapy and/or rituximab are significantly less
active than in indolent, follicular NHL. By the end of
sequential combined treatment, 20 patients (100%)
had achieved CR. It is even more noteworthy that, of
the 7 patients who achieved PR with FM, all
improved their remission status after treatment with
90
Y ibritumomab tiuxetan, and the 3-year PFS rate
was 89.5%. However, of course, a longer follow-up
will be required to really comment on these data in
terms of the duration of response.

Zevalin in Indolent NHL/Zinzani et al.

The toxicities we observed generally were mild
without any aspect of cumulative toxicity. Hematologic toxicity was moderate with 90Y ibritumomab
tiuxetan after 6 cycles of FM and rarely led to infection or required transfusion support. Conversely,
nonhematologic toxicity practically was absent with
90
Y ibritumomab tiuxetan.
In particular, the current results have demonstrated the possibility of using FM, a regimen that
contains fludarabine (an important immunosuppressor agent), sequentially with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in this histologic subtype and producing a
complete hematologic recovery. Because this novel
sequential treatment appears to be promising compared with results reported in the literature for the
combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone/CVP/fludarabine-containing
regimens plus rituximab, we believe that the current
Phase 2 trial represents an important first step and
positive new angle in therapy to combat indolent,
nonfollicular NHL.
