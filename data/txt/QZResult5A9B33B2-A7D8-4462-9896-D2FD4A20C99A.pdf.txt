Abstract

Author Manuscript

Inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy against certain types
of cancers such as melanoma and thyroid cancer. While demonstrated to be effective anticancer
agents, B-Raf or MEK inhibitors have also been associated with early tumor progression and
development of secondary neoplasms. The ligation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) with its receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5), leading to induction of
apoptosis, offers a promising anticancer strategy. Importantly, this is also a natural
immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer development. We previously demonstrated that
activated B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5 expression. Hence, our current
work sought to address whether B-Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition and the consequent suppression of
DR5 expression impede cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis and activated
immune cell-induced killing. We found that both B-Raf (e.g., PLX4032) and MEK inhibitors (e.g.,
AZD6244 and PD0325901) effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced DR5 levels
in both human thyroid cancer and melanoma cells. Similar to the observed effect of genetic
knockdown of the B-Raf gene, pretreatment of cancer cell lines with either B-Raf or MEK
inhibitors attenuated or abolished cellular apoptotic response induced by TRAIL or the DR5
agonistic antibody AMG655 or cell killing by activated T cells. Our findings clearly show that
inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling suppresses DR5 expression and impairs DR5 activationinduced apoptosis and T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. These findings suggest a potential
negative impact of B-Raf or MEK inhibition on TRAIL- or DR5-mediated anticancer therapy and
on TRAIL/DR5-mediated immune-clearance of cancer cells.

Introduction

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The MEK/ERK kinase cascade is known to be the predominant and best-studied effector
pathway downstream of Ras and Raf. It is often hyper-activated in many types of cancers,
particularly those with Ras or Raf mutations such as melanoma, thyroid and colon cancers,
hence playing a critical role in supporting the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. As a
result, great effort has been devoted to developing effective anticancer drugs targeting the
1 3
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway over the past decades. – The recent success of BRaf and MEK inhibitors in the treatment of advanced melanoma represents a giant stride
forward and has stimulated further research into the potential applications of this therapeutic
2 3
strategy in other types of cancers. , Despite the demonstrable efficacy in patients with
melanoma harboring the B-Raf V600E mutation, resistance to B-Raf inhibitors emerges
within months. Moreover, secondary tumors, most commonly cutaneous squamous-cell
carcinomas and keratoacanthomas, develop following prolonged treatment with B-Raf
4 5
inhibitors. , Similarly, increased cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and
keratoacanthomas are also seen in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma or primary
6 8
liver cancer in association with treatment with sorafenib. – These drawbacks limit the
clinical impact of these B-Raf inhibitors. Potential mechanisms mediating the increased
incidence of secondary neoplasia are under active investigation. Ras (particularly H-Ras)
mutation through paradoxical C-Raf-mediated activation of MEK/ERK signaling has been
9
suggested as an important factor contributing to increased risk of secondary tumors.
Consequently, the combination of B-Raf and MEK inhibitors was proposed as a strategy to
delay or even prevent the onset of resistance without increasing the development of
secondary cancers. Indeed, a recent phase II trial comparing the combination of B-Raf and
MEK inhibitors with B-Raf inhibition alone showed increased progression-free survival and
reduced incidence of secondary malignancies in patients with mutant B-Raf V600
10
melanoma. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the development of rapid resistance
and secondary cancers and even other potential risks with this targeted therapy remain to be
fully elucidated.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) represents a tumorselective apoptosis-inducing cytokine with potential as a cancer therapeutic agent. Its
ligation with death receptor 5 (DR5; also called TRAIL-R2 or Killer/DR5) rapidly activates
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, leading to apoptotic cell death. This process involves
trimerized DR5 interacting specifically with the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain
(FADD) via death domain interaction. The subsequent recruitment of caspase-8 through the
11
death effector domain of FADD leads to caspase-8 activation and ultimately, apoptosis.
Additionally, induction of DR5 aggregation or trimerization, e.g., by a DR5 agonistic
antibody, also triggers apoptosis. Consequently, pharmacological DR5 agonistic antibodies
11
have been developed and tested in the clinic as potential cancer therapeutics. Thus,
recombinant TRAIL and DR5 agonistic antibodies constitute a novel group of anticancer
therapeutics with promising potential.
TRAIL can be expressed by various cells of the immune system, including natural killer
12
(NK) cells, T cells, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), dendritic cells and macrophages.
Induction of apoptosis by ligation of endogenous TRAIL with its receptors (e.g., TRAIL/

DR5) has been recognized as a critical mechanism underlying the body’s immune
12 13
surveillance against tumors and metastases. , We demonstrated in our previous studies
that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5 expression through enhanced
14 15
CHOP and Elk-mediated transcription. , Moreover, we showed that human cancer cell
lines with Ras or Raf mutations were enriched in human cancer cell lines most responsive to
15
the DR5 agonistic antibody, AMG655. The current study aims to address whether
inhibition, particularly pharmacological inhibition, of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
downregulates DR5 expression and impairs cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced
apoptosis including immune-killing induced by activated T cells.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of B-Raf expression reduces DR5
levels and impedes cell response to TRAIL-induced apoptosis

Author Manuscript

To determine whether downregulation of DR5 expression by B-Raf inhibition affects cancer
cell response to DR5-mediated apoptosis, we used two different B-Raf siRNAs: one targets
mutant B-Raf V600E (siRaf-m) only and another silences both wild-type and mutant B-Raf
(siRaf). We knocked down B-Raf expression in two cancer cell lines with B-Raf V600E
mutation and then evaluated cell responses to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In both BCPAP
and LOXIMVI cell lines, knockdown of B-Raf expression with either of the two B-Raf
siRNAs reduced p-ERK1/2 levels accompanied by reduced levels of DR5 (Fig. 1A), hence
15
confirming our previous finding that B-Raf positively regulates DR5 expression.
Following exposure to TRAIL, we detected much higher levels of cleaved PARP, capase-8
and caspase-3 in control siRNA-transfected cells than in B-Raf siRNA-transfected cells (Fig.
1B) as evaluated by Western blotting. In agreement, there were much more survival cells in
B-Raf siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells upon TRAIL
treatment (Fig. 1C). These results together clearly indicate that genetic inhibition of B-Raf
confers resistance of these cancer cell lines to undergo TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Pharmacological inhibition of B-Raf or MEK downregulates DR5 expression

Author Manuscript

We then asked whether pharmacological inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling with either
B-Raf or MEK inhibitors suppresses DR5 expression in cancer cell lines with activated
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. To this end, we chose three inhibitors in clinical development,
PLX4032 (vemurafenib; a B-Raf V600E specific inhibitor), AZD6244 (selumetinib or
ARRY-142886; a MEK inhibitor) and PD0325901 (a MEK inhibitor), and tested their effects
on DR5 expression in two thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP and TPC-1) and two melanoma
cell lines (LOXIMVI and A375). At the tested concentration ranges (1–10 μM), all three
agents decreased the levels of p-ERK1/2 in the four cancer cell lines, indicating the effective
suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Correspondingly, we observed reduction of
DR5 levels in these cell lines post exposure to these inhibitors (Fig. 2A). Moreover we
examined the effects of PLX4032 and AZD6244 at sub-micromolar concentrations on DR5
expression and found that both agents at 0.25 μM and 0.5 μM effectively reduced the levels
of p-ERK1/2 and DR5 (Fig. 2B), indicating that these agents at low concentration ranges
also suppress DR5 expression. Time-course analysis showed that the onset of DR5 reduction
occurred as early as 4 h post treatment and was sustained for up to 20 h (Fig. 2C). Together

these results clearly demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling pathway with either a B-Raf or a MEK inhibitor downregulates DR5 expression in
cancer cells. We also looked at the effect of PLX4032 on DR4 expression and found that
PLX4032 did not decrease the levels of DR4 in the tested cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1),
suggesting that PLX4032 primarily decreases the expression of DR5, but not DR4.
We noted that PLX4032 had a weaker effect than AZD6244 and PD0325901on decreasing
the levels of p-ERK1/2 in the TPC-1 cell line, which lacks an activating B-Raf mutation,
indicating a limited effect on wild type B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Accordingly, we
observed a weaker effect of this agent on reducing DR5 levels in this cell line (Figs. 2A and
2C). Thus, it appears that the potency of suppression of MEK/ERK signaling is tightly
associated with the degree of DR5 reduction.

Author Manuscript

We also examined the recovery rate of DR5 expression after stopping treatment. To this end,
we treated BCPAP cells with PLX4032 for 16 h and then washed off the agent. Cells were
re-fed with fresh complete medium and harvested at different time points post wash. As
presented in Fig. 2D, recovery of DR5 expression was observed at 4 h which progressively
increased until it reached almost normal levels at 16 h. In parallel, p-ERK1/2 levels showed
a similar pattern of recovery. Similar results were also generated in BCPAP cells treated with
AZD6244 (data not shown). These results indicate that the DR5 suppression by a B-Raf or
MEK inhibitor is transient and its recovery is tightly associated with reactivation of
MEK/ERK signaling.
Pharmacological inhibition of B-Raf decreases cell surface DR5 levels and suppresses
DR5 transcription

Author Manuscript

Since DR5 primarily function as a cell surface protein, we then further analyzed the effect of
inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling on cell surface DR5 levels. As presented in Figs.
3A and 3B, PLX4032 substantially decreased the amounts of cell surface DR5 in both A375
and LOXIMVI cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling (e.g.,
with PLX4032) clearly reduces levels of functional cell surface DR5 in cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5
14 15
expression through enhancing its transcription. , Thus we speculated that B-Raf
inhibition will suppress DR5 transcription, leading to downregulation of DR5 expression.
Indeed, we detected decreased DR5 mRNA levels in cells exposed to PLX4032 as evaluated
with RT-PCR (Fig. 3C). Moreover, B-Raf (V600E)-induced DR5 promoter activity was
substantially inhibited by PLX4032 in a DR5 promoter luciferase assay (Fig. 3D). Hence, it
is clear that B-Raf inhibition (e.g., with PLX4032) suppresses DR5 expression at
transcriptional level.
Pre-treatment of cancer cells with a B-Raf or MEK inhibitor or with their combination
impairs cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis
Following these findings, we further determined whether pharmacological inhibition of
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling compromises cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced
apoptosis. The general strategy was to pre-expose cancer cell lines known to be sensitive to
TRAIL or DR5 agonistic antibody to a B-Raf or MEK inhibitor for a given period of time

and then switch to treatment with either TRAIL or a DR5 agonistic antibody (e.g.,
AMG655; conatumumab). Overnight pre-treatment (approximately 18 h) of BCPAP cells
with PLX4032, AZD6244 or PD0325901 abolished the apoptosis-inducing effects of TRAIL
as evidenced by increased survival of the tested cancer cells (Fig. 4A), decreased cleavage of
caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4B), and decreased DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4C). In
TPC-1 cells, we generated similar results with AZD6244 or PD0325901 pre-exposure.
However, PLX4032 showed only partial inhibition of TRAIL effects on cell survival, protein
cleavage and DNA fragmentation (Figs. 4A-C), likely due to its weaker suppression of
MEK/ERK signaling and DR5 expression. Similar results were also generated in A375 cells
pre-exposed to PLX4032 or in LOXIMVI cells pre-exposed to AZD6244 (supplemental Fig.
S2). These data clearly show that pre-inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling indeed
compromises or impairs cancer cell response to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

We also examined whether pre-treatment of cancer cells with these inhibitors impacts cancer
cell response to AMG655-induced apoptosis. Using AZD6244 as a representative inhibitor,
we found that AMG655 potently reduced cell survival, induced cleavage of caspase-8,
caspase-3 and PARP and increased DNA fragmentation in BCPAP, TPC-1 and LOXIMVI
cells pre-exposed to DMSO control solvent, whereas overnight pretreatment with AZD2644
abrogated these effects of AMG655 (Fig. 5). Therefore, pre-treatment of cancer cells with a
MEK inhibitor also impedes cancer cell response to DR5 agonistic antibody-induced
apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

Given that the combination of a B-Raf inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor has been a common
strategy for treatment of certain types of cancers (e.g., melanoma) in the clinic, we further
examined the effects of the combination on DR5 expression and cell response to TRAILinduced apoptosis. We found that the combination of PLX4032 and AZD6244 exerted
similar results to PLX4032 or AZD6244 alone in suppressing ERK phosphorylation and in
decreasing DR5 expression in both A375 and LOXMVI cells (Fig. 6A). In agreement, the
combination was as effective as PLX4032 or AZD6244 alone in protecting the tested cancer
cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis as evaluate with detection of cleaved caspases and
PARP (Fig. 6B) and DNA fragments (Fig. 6B) occurred during apoptosis. Collectively, we
conclude that pre-treatment of cancer cells with a B-Raf or MEK inhibitor or with their
combination impairs cancer cell responses to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis.
Pharmacological inhibition of B-Raf signaling protects cancer cells from killing by
activated human T cells

Author Manuscript

Lastly, we asked whether pharmacological inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling impairs
cancer cell killing by immune cells. To this end, we used T cell-mediated killing of cancer
cells as a model to address this question. In this particular study, we used A375 and
LOXIMVI, which are sensitive to both TRAIL-induced apoptosis and T-cell-mediated
killing. When comparing the responses of control and PLX4032-pretreated A375 or
LOXIMVI cells to T cell-mediated killing following co-culture of activated human T cells
and the tested cancer cells, we found a greater proportion of surviving cells with PLX4032pretreated A375 or LOXIMVI cells than the matched control cells (Figs. 7A and 7B). In the
presence of a neutralizing TRAIL antibody, T cell-mediated killing of A375 cells was

significantly attenuated (Fig. 7C), indicating that TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is indeed
involved in T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. Together, our data suggest that B-Raf
inhibition can protect sensitive cancer cells from activated T cell-mediated killing.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The current study clearly shows that inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, through
suppression of mutant B-Raf expression with a B-Raf siRNA or through inhibition of B-Raf
or MEK activity with a pharmacological inhibitor, downregulates the basal expression levels
of DR5 including cell surface DR5 in the tested cancer cell lines (Figs. 1–3). The degree of
DR5 reduction seems tightly associated with the potency of suppression of MEK/ERK
signaling (e.g., the case of PLX4032 on DR5 suppression in TPC-1 cells). Hence these
results reinforce our previously reported finding that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
14 15
14 15
positively regulates DR5 expression. , As demonstrated previously, ,
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activates CHOP and Elk1-dependent DR5 transcription,
resulting in elevated DR5 expression. In this study, inhibition of B-Raf with PLX4032
decreased DR5 mRNA levels and suppressed DR5 promoter activity (Figs. 3C and 3D),
indicating that PLX4032 suppresses DR5 expression at transcriptional level. Hence, it is
plausible to assume that inhibition of B-Raf or MEK (e.g., with a chemical inhibitor)
suppresses the MEK/ERK signaling and CHOP/Elk1-dependent DR5 transcription,
eventually resulting in downregulation of DR5 expression.

Induction of apoptosis with a recombinant TRAIL or an agonistic DR5 antibody has
emerged as an attractive cancer therapeutic strategy, but has not been established to be
successful in the clinic. In our previous study, we showed that cancer cell lines with Ras or
Raf mutations were enriched in the category of cells most responsive or sensitive to
15
AMG655. In this study, we demonstrate that pre-treatment of the sensitive cancer cell
lines (e.g., LOXIMVI, A375, TPC-1 and BCPAP) with a B-Raf or MEK inhibitor
downregulates DR5 expression and impedes the response of these cancer cell lines to
TRAIL- or AMG655-induced apoptosis, implying a potential negative impact of B-Raf- or
MEK-targeted cancer therapy on the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL- or DR5-based cancer
therapy. Of the three tested inhibitors, PLX4032 is an FDA-approved anticancer, while
AZD6244 and PD0325901 are under testing in the clinic. The clinically achievable
16
17 18
concentration of PLX4032 in plasma is over 80 μM and is 2–6 μM for AZD6244. ,
We observed that these inhibitors effectively inhibit DR5 expression at these clinically
relevant doses in our preclinical models (Fig. 2). Hence, it is safe to expect that sustained
treatment of patients with these B-Raf or MEK inhibitors in the clinic may result in drastic
downregulation or depletion of DR5 expression in cancer tissues. It also follows from our
findings that cancer patients who have been exposed to B-Raf- or MEK-targeted therapy or
other similar therapies that may inhibit the MEK/ERK signaling are less likely to respond to
treatment strategies that depend on TRAIL- or DR5-mediated mechanisms. Thus, our
findings are clearly of high translational significance.
Immunotherapy also represents an attractive strategy against cancers such as melanoma, and
is believed to involve killing of cancer cells by induction of apoptosis. One of the primary
underlying mechanisms involves death ligand-induced apoptotic signaling mainly by TRAIL

from T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells. Similar to TRAIL-based cancer therapy, our
findings also raise important concerns for a potential negative impact of B-Raf or MEKtargeted pretreatment on the clinical efficacy of salvage treatment with immune-based cancer
therapy. The most significant support for this concern comes from our data showing that
human T cells, which cause TRAIL-mediated killing of cancer cells, were significantly less
effective in killing cancer cells pretreated with the B-Raf inhibitor PLX4032 in comparison
to the degree of cytotoxicity observed in untreated control cancer cells (Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

While prior reports have shown that inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling with B-Raf
inhibitors (e.g., Raf265, L-779450 and sorafenib) sensitizes certain types of cancer cells to
20 22
TRAIL-induced apoptosis, – these results were generated under conditions in which the
cancer cells were co-treated with the combination of a given inhibitor and TRAIL. Our
findings emphasize the negative impact of pretreatment of cancer cells with a B-Raf or MEK
inhibitor on TRAIL-induced apoptosis and hence would suggest a potentially harmful effect
of the sequence whereby patients are first treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of B-raf
or MEK followed by an immune-based or TRAIL- or DR5-targeted cancer therapy.

Author Manuscript

Endogenous TRAIL and DR5 interaction leading to induction of apoptosis is recognized as a
12 13
critical immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer cells. , Hence defective death
receptor signaling is a mechanism that may favor immune evasion and survival of cancer
cells. Our demonstration of the downregulation of DR5 expression in cancer cells and
impairment of cancer cell response to TRAIL-induced apoptosis or T cell-mediated killing
by inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling may suggest that the long-term treatment of
cancers with a B-RAF or MEK inhibitor may compromise immune surveillance of cancer
cells or encourage their escape from immune surveillance. As a consequence, this may lead
to increased metastasis or the appearance of secondary malignancies. Thus, further
preclinical and clinical studies in this direction are warranted.
Our results clearly show that DR5 reduction due to pharmacological inhibition of the
Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is transient, with full repletion within 16 hours of
stopping the treatment (Fig. 2). An intermittent treatment schedule rather than continuous
administration may thus prevent sustained suppression of DR5 expression and the attendant
negative consequences. Alternatively, a combination of Raf/MEK/ERK-targeted therapy
with a biological agent that can prevent DR5 reduction without interfering with suppressive
activity against Raf/MEK/ERK signaling should be explored.

Author Manuscript

Although the combination of a B-Raf and MEK inhibitor represents an effective strategy in
preventing rebound activation of MEK/ERK signaling due to B-Raf inhibition, it does not
eliminate the concerns we discussed above regarding suppression of DR5 expression and
impairment of DR5 activation-induced apoptosis occurred during B-Ref- or MEK-targeted
cancer therapy. This is simply because both inhibitors target the same signaling axis. Indeed,
we found that the combination of PLX4032 and AZD6244 functioned just as PLX4302 or
AZD6244 alone did in decreasing DR5 expression and protected cancer cells from TRAILinduced apoptosis (Fig. 6). Hence the potential harmful effect of the combination regimen
on DR5-targeted cancer therapy, immunotherapy and immune surveillance should be
considered as well.
