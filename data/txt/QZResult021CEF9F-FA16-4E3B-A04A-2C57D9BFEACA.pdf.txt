Disruption of the histone modiﬁcation patterns is one of the most common features of human tumors. However, few genetic
alterations in the histone modiﬁer genes have been described in tumorigenesis. Herein we show that the histone methyltransferase
SETDB1 undergoes gene ampliﬁcation in non-small and small lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors. The existence of additional
copies of the SETDB1 gene in these transformed cells is associated with higher levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein. From
a functional standpoint, the depletion of SETDB1 expression in ampliﬁed cells reduces cancer growth in cell culture and nude mice
models, whereas its overexpression increases the tumor invasiveness. The increased gene dosage of SETDB1 is also associated with
enhanced sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effect mediated by the SETDB1-interfering drug mithramycin. Overall, the ﬁndings
identify SETDB1 as a bona ﬁde oncogene undergoing gene ampliﬁcation-associated activation in lung cancer and suggest its
potential for new therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Disruption of the epigenetic landscape is a common event in
cancer cells, leading to signiﬁcant changes in chromatin structure
and gene expression.1,2 Although information about DNA
methylation proﬁles is widespread, we know much less about
the patterns of histone modiﬁcation disruption in human tumors.3
In this latter setting, it is recognized that there are particular
combinations of histone marks for a given promoter associated
with the transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such
as deacetylation of histones H3 and H4, loss of H3K4
trimethylation, and gain of H3-K9 methylation and Lys27 of
histone H3 (H3K27) trimethylation.1,2 At the global level, cancer
cells show reduced monoacetylated and trimethylated lysines 16
and 20 of histone H4,4 respectively, and histone acetylation and
dimethylation changes in histones H3 and H4, respectively, might
have prognostic value.5 Recent efforts to study human cancer
genomics have highlighted that point mutations, translocations,
deletions and gene ampliﬁcation events occur in histone modiﬁer
enzymes such as histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases,
methyltransferases and demethyltransferases.6–9
One of the best examples of a histone methyltransferase
involved in human cancer is the enhancer of zeste homolog 2, a
component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which
represses gene transcription via trimethylation of H3K27 that
targets tumor suppressor genes.10–13 The enhancer of zeste
homolog 2 has the hallmarks of an oncogene, particularly in
prostate and breast cancer, where elevated levels are found in the
more advanced forms of the disease.14–16 Recently, the enhancer

of zeste homolog 2 gain-of-function mutations have also been
found in lymphomas.17 However, the list of histone methyltransferases with a role in tumorigenesis is rapidly growing,
and includes such examples as the mixed lineage leukemia 1
(ALL-1/HRX),18 hDOT1L,19 which is targeted by chromosomal
translocations, and NSD1 that undergoes DNA methylationassociated silencing in solid tumors.20
Among the different histone methyltransferases, SETDB1 has
been of increasing interest owing to its involvement in the
development of melanoma, where it resides in a recurrently
ampliﬁed chromosome 1q21 interval and accelerates melanoma
onset in a zebraﬁsh model,21 and also because the described
1q21.3 region includes a plausible human melanoma susceptibility
gene. SETDB1 is a likely candidate for this.22 Also known as ESET or
KMT1E, SETDB1 is a histone H3 lysine 9-speciﬁc methyltransferase
involved in the transcriptional silencing of euchromatic genes and
retroelements.23–26 Recent reports also show that SETDB1 is
essential for proviral silencing and for controlling developmental
regulators and chimeric transcripts that maintain the fate of
embryonic stem cells.26–28 In addition to the discoveries in
melanoma,21,22 the role of SETDB1 in cancer was also suggested
by its association with the DNA methylation machinery,25 the
promyelocytic nuclear leukemia-nuclear bodies29 and by its
increased expression in transformed broncoepithelial cells.30
These ﬁndings prompted us to investigate the possible
presence of SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation and its associated overexpression in lung cancer cells and primary tumors. Extra copies of
an oncogene may give tumor cells a growth advantage as well as

Figure 1. Determination of SETDB1 gene amplification and its association with RNA and protein overexpression in lung cancer cell lines.
(a) Assessment of SETDB1 copy-number by quantitative genomic PCR. Amplification frequency of SETDB1 (evaluated with SYBR Green,
Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was calculated by the standard curve method using the 7900HT SDS program. To define an internal control gene,
we chose chromosome 1p36.23 because it is the least aneuploid region among our cell lines (PEX19 gene). Primers are available upon request.
DNA from normal lung was used as the reference standard. Results are reported as n-fold copy-number increase relative to the PEX19 gene.
(b) Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the SETDB1 gene. The UCSC genome browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu) was used to select the
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone spanning the 1q21 region for the SETDB1 gene: RP11-42A12. A telomeric BAC clone located in the
telomeric 1p36.23 region was used as a control. The BACs were obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center at the Children’s Hospital Oakland
Research Institute (Oakland, CA, USA). SETDB1 and telomeric probes were labeled with Spectrum Green and Red dUTP (Abbott, Wiesbaden,
Germany), respectively, using a CGH Nick Translation Reagent Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). The samples were
counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield antifade solution (Burlingame, CA, USA). Gene amplification was observed in
the interphases of NCI-H1437, NCI-H1395 and DMS-273. Probes were verified to give a single signal on normal commercial lymphocyte
metaphase slides (CGH Reagents, Abbott). Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (c) and western blot (d) demonstrate higher levels of
SETDB1 mRNA and protein (ab12317, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), respectively, in amplified cancer cell lines (H1437, NCI-H1395 and DMS-273)
than that in unamplified cells. PCR primers are available upon request.

being a mechanism associated with different sensitivity to
therapies.31 The identiﬁcation of ampliﬁed target genes is of
great importance for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and
ultimately for designing targeted therapies, ERBB2/HER-2 in
breast cancer being the best example.32 Thus, we examined
whether the SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation occurs in lung cancer cell
lines and primary tumors, and studied its impact on mRNA and
protein expression levels, its functional role in lung cancer growth
and its potential value as a biomarker for predicting the response
to particular chemotherapeutic agents in lung tumors.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We ﬁrst screened a collection of 15 human lung cancer cell lines
for SETDB1 gene copy-number alterations. These included seven
non-small (A549, NCI-H1299, NCI-H1975, NCI-H1993, NCI-H2170,
NCI-H1437 and NCI-H1395) and eight small (HCC-33, N417, NCIH446, NCI-H1048, NCI-H1963, NCI-H2029, DMS-114 and DMS-273)
cell lung cancer types. The lung cancer cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA)
and were grown and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium. Primary normal tissues
such as lung epithelium and leukocytes were used as normal
SETDB1 copy-number control samples. Using a quantitative
genomic PCR approach, we observed that two non-small (NCIH1437 and NCI-H1395) and one small (DMS-273) cell lung cancer
Oncogene (2014) 2807 – 2813

lines had a greater than four-fold change in SETDB1 gene copy
number (Figure 1a). This increase was particularly important in the
small lung cancer cell line DMS-273 (Figure 1a). The remaining
eleven lung cancer cell lines did not present any evident change
in SETDB1 gene copy number (that is, ampliﬁcation, half gene
dosage or homozygous deletion). We performed ﬂuorescence
in situ hybridization analyses to conﬁrm the presence of SETDB1
gene ampliﬁcation suggested to occur in the three lung cancer
cell lines by the competitive genomic PCR approach (Figure 1b).
The ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization technique conﬁrmed the
presence of SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation in NCI-H1437, NCI-H1395
and DMS-273 (Figure 1b). The applied ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization technique was validated by the observation of the
normal copy-number of the SETDB1 gene in lymphocytes
(Figure 1b). Using reported copy-number variation data,33 we
have determined the size of the amplicon that contains SETDB1 in
the three studied lung cancer cell lines: DMS-273 (1 038 210 bp),
NCI-H1437 (4 539 342 bp) and NCI-H1395 (4 623 419 bp). SETDB1 is
genomically located in the middle of all three amplicons, even in
the case of the smallest one (DMS-273; Supplementary Figure S1).
In melanoma, the only other tumor type where SETDB1 genetic
ampliﬁcation has been reported,21 all the melanoma cell lines with
ampliﬁcation at this genomic locus (1q21) contain the SETDB1
gene according to the copy-number variation data.33 In addition,
in the smallest amplicon detected in the melanoma setting (cell
line COLO-679, 2 797 611 bp), SETDB1 is also located right in the

analysis of variance (ANOVA) test). (c) The colony formation assay showed that DMS-273 and NCI-H1437 cells stably transfected with the

middle (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, SETDB1 is within the
smallest identiﬁed region of recurrent ampliﬁcation.
We next considered the possible existence of an association
between extra copies of the SETDB1 gene and overexpression of
the corresponding RNA transcript and protein using quantitative
reverse transcription–PCR and western blot approaches, respectively, (Figures 1c and d). We found that the expression of SETDB1
for both mRNA and protein was enhanced in cancer cell lines
harboring the SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation event relative to nonampliﬁed cancer cells (Figures 1c and d). In the smallest SETDB1
amplicon (present in DMS-273 cells), thirty-four genes are also coampliﬁed (Supplementary Figure S1). Using reported microarray
expression data, we have observed that, in addition to SETDB1,
only 7 of these other 34 genes (21%) are overexpressed in DMS273, NCI-H1437 and NCI-H1395 in comparison with unampliﬁed
lung cancer cells (NCI-H1299 and A549; Supplementary Figure S1).
In this regard, we have conﬁrmed by quantitative reverse
transcription–PCR that six of these seven genes are overexpressed
in the SETDB1-ampliﬁed lung cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1).
Once we had demonstrated the presence of SETDB1 gene
ampliﬁcation and its associated overexpression in the lung cancer
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

cell lines, we examined its contribution to the tumorigenic
phenotype in vitro and in vivo. We ﬁrst analyzed the effect of
SETDB1 depletion in lung cancer cells harboring its gene
ampliﬁcation and its associated overexpression. Supplementary
Table S1 includes all the used short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
sequences. Three SETDB1 shRNA-depleted clones were established for DMS-273 cells (A30, A31 and B32-63) and two clones for
NCI-H1437 (A56-B and B49-6). Experiments for each clone were
performed in triplicate. We observed that the reduction of SETDB1
expression in the gene-ampliﬁed cells had cancer growth
inhibitory features (Figure 2). Upon stable transfection of shRNAs
against SETDB1 in the gene-ampliﬁed DMS-273 and NCI-H1437
lung cancer cell lines and efﬁcient depletion of the SETDB1 protein
(Figure 2a), the cells proved less viable in the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S2) and had a markedly
reduced percentage colony-formation density in the assay
developed on plastic plate (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure
S2). Transfection of the scramble shRNA did not reduce cell
viability (Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S2) and had no
impact on the colony formation assay (Figure 2c and

Figure 3. Impact of SETDB1 on invasiveness and chemosensitivity. (a) Effect of SETDB1 on the invasion potential of A549 cells determined by
the matrigel invasion assay. Cells were transfected with 3 mg of Flag-SETDB1 or empty vector in 60 mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were stimulated
or not with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin (Io) for 30 min. Then cells were trypsinized, and 5  104 cells were resuspended in
serum-free media and added to the upper compartment of a transwell coated with 1 mg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Lexington, KY, USA).
Media with 10% fetal bovine serum was added in the lower compartment and cells were incubated at 37 1C for 42 h. Invasive cells were fixed
with phosphate-buffered saline 4% paraformaldehide, stained with 0.5% violet crystal and visualized and photographed under a  10
magnification objective with a microscope. Invasive cells were counted using ImageJ 1.45s (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA) and percentage of invasive cells were represented. Results are the mean of at least three experiments by duplicate and
the significance was determined using analysis of variance test. *oP ¼ 0.05. (b) Cancer cells harboring the SETDB1 gene amplification are
sensitive to the decrease in cell viability caused by mithramycin, a SETDB1-interfering drug. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays in control-scrambled shRNA DMS-273-transfected cells in comparison with three shRNA-stable
downregulated SETDB1 clones (A21, A30 and A31) show enhanced inhibition of viability in cells with SETDB1 gene amplification-mediated
overexpression.

Supplementary Figure S2). Confocal microscopy experiments in the
NCI-H1437 lung cancer cell line conﬁrmed the expected nuclear
staining of the SETDB1 protein (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
colocalization; Supplementary Figure S3) and the disappearance
of the nuclear signal upon SETDB1 shRNA-mediated depletion
(Supplementary Figure S3). SETDB1 knockdown by the shRNA
approach in a lung cancer cell line without gene ampliﬁcation (NCIH1299) did not cause a signiﬁcant effect in the cell growth
determined by the MTT experiments or the colony formation assay
(Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting the SETDB1 dependence for
cell growth only in the ampliﬁed cancer cells.
We next tested the ability of SETDB1 shRNA-transfected DMS273 and -NCI-H1437 cells to form tumors in nude mice compared
with scramble shRNA-transfected cells (Figure 2d). DMS-273- and
NCI-H1437-scramble shRNA-transfected cells formed tumors
rapidly, but cells with shRNA-mediated depletion of SETDB1 had
much lower tumorigenicity (Figure 2d). We also studied the
oncogenic potential of SETDB1 by evaluating its ability to enhance
cell invasion in a lung carcinoma cell line without SETDB1 gene
ampliﬁcation (A549; Figure 3a). To this end, we transfected the
plasmids driving the expression of SETDB1 and performed a
matrigel invasion assay. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in the
number of invasive cells upon SETDB1 transfection in comparison
with empty vector-transfected cells (Figure 3a).
We also wondered about gene targets in the ampliﬁed lung
cancer cells whose expression could be regulated by SETDB1mediated H3-K9 promoter methylation and that could further
explain the above observed impact in cell growth and invasiveness. To ﬁnd downstream targets of SETDB1 in the ampliﬁed lung
cancer cell lines DMS-273 and NCI-H1437, we have developed
expression microarray analyses (Agilent G4851B 60K, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) of both SETDB1 shRNA-depleted cell lines in comparison
Oncogene (2014) 2807 – 2813

with their corresponding shRNA-scrambled control cell lines. The
microarray expression data obtained are freely available at the
Gene Expression Omnibus database: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?token=tdexdacygiayejy&acc=GSE45175.
Using this approach, we have identiﬁed eighteen common
genes repressed in both SETDB1-ampliﬁed lung cancer cell lines
that become upregulated upon SETDB1 shRNA-mediated downregulation (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S4).
We have also conﬁrmed the expression changes of the candidate
genes by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR and the shift in
H3-K9 methylation status in their respective promoters by
quantitative chromatin immunoprecitation (Supplementary Figure
S4). Related to function, gene ontology analysis of these genes
determined ‘regulation of cell proliferation’ as the most signiﬁcantly enriched biological process (false discovery rate ¼ 0.0006).
Representative examples included the tumor suppressor roles of
delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor34 and
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7.35
The observation that the presence of the SETDB1 gene
ampliﬁcation with associated overexpression was critical for the
tumorigenesis of these lung cancer cells prompted us to examine
whether drugs targeting this pathway might ﬁnd a therapeutic
‘niche’ for their use in the described subset of cases with extra
copies of this gene. Similar scenarios have been described for
inhibitors of another histone methyltransferase, DOT1L,36 and the
BET family of acetyl-lysine-recognizing chromatin ‘adaptor’
proteins37–39 in which hematological malignancies carrying
gene-activating events involving targets of these pathways are
more sensitive to these drugs. No highly speciﬁc inhibitor for
SETDB1 has been described in the publicly available literature, but
to the best of our knowledge, one agent —mithramycin— could
be important in targeting SETDB1.40 Mithramycin is a clinically

(a) Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the SETDB1 gene shows gene amplification in the primary lung tumors 1, 2 and 3. SETDB1 unamplified

approved antitumor antibiotic that binds to DNA by interacting
with the minor groove and displacing transcriptional activators
that bind to GC-rich binding sites.41 Most importantly, it has been
shown to suppress basal SETDB1 promoter activity in a dosedependent manner by inhibiting the binding of Sp transcription
factors.40 Thus, we tested whether a putative growth inhibitory
effect of this drug in lung cancer cells was dependent on SETDB1
expression. First, we developed western blot analyses for the
SETDB1 protein in the SETDB1-ampliﬁed lung cancer cell lines
DMS-273, NCI-H1437 and NCI-H1395 upon the use of the drug. We
found that mithramycin was able to inhibit SETDB1 expression in
the three cell lines (Supplementary Figure S5). Using the small
lung cancer cell line DMS-273, harboring the previously identiﬁed
SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation, in comparison with three stable short
hairpin SETDB1-depleted clones, we observed that the scramble
shRNA DMS-273 cells were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to the
growth inhibitory effect mediated by mithramycin than any of the
depleted clones (A30, A31 and B32-63; Figure 3 and
Supplementary Figure S5). Experiments for each clone were
performed in triplicate. Furthermore, we extended the cell viability
experiments, using the MTT assay, to the other two SETDB1ampliﬁed lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H1437 and NCI-H1395) and to
three SETDB1 non-ampliﬁed lung cancer cell lines (DMS-114, A549
and NCI-H1299). The determination of the corresponding EC50
values further conﬁrmed that SETDB1-ampliﬁed cell lines
(EC50 ¼ 13.6 nM for NCI-H1437 and EC50 ¼ 14.7 nM for NCIH1395) are more sensitive to the drug than the non-ampliﬁed
cell lines (EC50 ¼ 347.5 nM for DMS-114, EC50 ¼ 122 nM for A549
and EC50 ¼ 32 nM for NCI-H1299; analysis of variance, Po0.001).
Thus, at least in vitro, the presence of SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation
could ‘mark’ lung cancer cells that are more sensitive to the
inhibition of cell viability associated with the use of mithramycin,
for which previous data also suggested SETDB1 as a likely
candidate target gene of the drug.40
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

Finally, we sought to demonstrate that the presence of SETDB1
gene ampliﬁcation was not a speciﬁc feature of in vitro grown lung
cancer cell lines and that it also occurred in primary tumors of
lung cancer patients. In this regard, the 1q chromosome arm
undergoes gains (trisomic or tetrasomic) in lung cancer42–44
that are also associated with overrepresentation of the 1q21
region.45–47 Recent genomic data48,49 using single-nucleotide
polymorphism microarrays conﬁrm the gain of the SETDB1-1q21
chromosomic region in primary lung tumors. Herein, we
performed ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analyses for the
SETDB1 locus using a collection of 59 primary lung tumors,
corresponding to 40 non-small cell lung tumors (20 squamous cell
carcinoma and 20 adenocarcinomas) and 19 small cell carcinomas
(Figure 4a). We identiﬁed SETDB1 gene ampliﬁcation in nine
tumors corresponding to 20% (4 of 20), 20% (4 of 20) and 5%
(1 of 19) of adenocarcinoma, squamous and small cell lung cancer
cases, respectively. Most importantly, we also demonstrated that
the presence of extra copies of SETDB1 in these nine primary
tumors was associated with overexpression of the SETDB1 protein,
as determined by immunohistochemistry in all cases (Figure 4b).
Among the remaining ﬁfty unampliﬁed cases, eight (14%) also
showed enhanced SETDB1 expression that could be associated
with other upstream regulatory events.
Overall, our results indicate that the histone methyltransferase
SETDB1 undergoes gene ampliﬁcation in the natural history of
lung tumorigenesis in non-small and small cell lung cancers. The
copy-number gain for SETDB1 is associated with overexpression of
the transcript and protein in lung cancer cell lines and primary
tumors. From a functional standpoint, SETDB1 exerts growth
enhancing activity in vitro and in vivo, as we have shown by
depletion and transfection experiments in cell culture and in the
nude mice model. Lung cancer cells carrying a SETDB1 gene
ampliﬁcation event are also more sensitive to the antiproliferative
action mediated by the antitumoral antibiotic mithramycin, a

proposed inhibitor of SETDB1 activity. Thus, our results suggest
an oncogenic role for SETDB1 in lung carcinogenesis and raise
the possibility of exploring new targeted therapies for the
subset of lung tumor patients harboring the SETDB1 gene
ampliﬁcation event.
