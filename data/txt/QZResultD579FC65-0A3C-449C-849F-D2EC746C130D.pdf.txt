BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are a biologically heterogeneous group in which various gene alterations
have been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and prognostic impact of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC rearrangements in cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab (R-CHOP)-treated DLBCL cases. METHODS:
Tissue microarrays were constructed from 239 cases of DLBCL, and the expressions of CD10, BCL6, MUM1/IRF4, and BCL2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements were investigated by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays. Survival analysis was constructed from 145 R-CHOP–treated patients. RESULTS: MYC, BCL2, and BCL6
rearrangements were detected in 14 (6%), 36 (15%), and 69 (29%) of 239 DLBCL patients. Double or triple rearrangements were
detected in 7 (3%) of 239 DLBCL cases. Of these, 4 had BCL2 and MYC, 2 had BCL6 and MYC, and 1 had BCL2, BCL6, and MYC rearrangements. The prognosis of these cases was extremely poor, with a median survival of 9 months. MYC rearrangement was associated with significantly worse overall survival (P ¼ .01), especially for the cases with GC phenotype (P ¼ .009). BCL6 rearrangement
also predicted significantly shorter overall survival (P ¼ .04), especially for the non-GC phenotype (P ¼ .03). BCL2 rearrangement had
no prognostic impact on outcome. International Prognostic Index (P ¼ .004) and MYC rearrangement (P ¼ .009) were independent
poor prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of MYC gene rearrangement along with BCL2 and BCL6 is critical in identifying

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases with varied morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features.1 Although
more than half of the patients are cured with a combination of rituximab with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, such as
the R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab; immunochemotherapy) regimen, responses are heterogeneous, and many patients die of their disease.2,3
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is considered the most important prognostic factor for survival and the best
method to identify high-risk patients who are unlikely to achieve a long-term remission with standard chemotherapy.3,4
However, even within identical IPI risk groups, a substantial variability in outcome has been observed.3 In addition, gene
expression profiling has identified DLBCL subtypes based on cell of origin, including germinal center (GC), activated Bcell subtype, and unclassified DLBCL.5,6 Hans and colleagues proposed an algorithm to discriminate GC from non-GC
phenotypic DLBCL, based on CD10, BCL6, and MUM1/IRF4 expression, determined by immunohistochemistry.7
Patients with GC phenotype had better survival than those with non-GC phenotype.7,8 The prognostic value of this algorithm has been confirmed among patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy by some studies but not
others.9-13 In addition, even for patients receiving immunochemotherapy, the predictive value of the immunohistochemically defined GC and non-GC phenotypes remains controversial.14,15
Because the patients with DLBCL have widely various clinical outcomes, the discovery of prognostic markers that
accurately predict outcome is an important area of investigation. Recurrent chromosomal translocations of MYC, BCL2,
and BCL6 have been reported in DLBCLs.16-20 The MYC translocation is a characteristic cytogenetic event for Burkitt

lymphoma (BL), but has also been reported to occur in
DLBCLs with a frequency of 3% to 16%.13,18,21-27 Such
cases have an adverse prognosis with chemoresistance and
shortened survival, but little is known about the relative
significance of MYC in the context of other established
prognostic features.21-26 Moreover, it is unclear whether
there are identifiable clinicopathologic presentations that
predict the likelihood of MYC aberrancy.
In contrast to BL, MYC aberrations in DLBCL are
usually associated with multiple cytogenetic abnormalities
and other genetic lesions, such as concurrent rearrangements of BCL2 and/or BCL6. Patients with so-called double-hit or triple-hit lymphomas have an extremely poor
prognosis, with few survivors beyond 6 months.28-32 In
the updated 2008 World Health Organization (WHO)
classification, double-hit and triple-hit lymphoma are
classified as B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features
intermediate between DLBCL and BL.33
BCL6 is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality
in DLBCL, occurring in up to 30% to 35% of cases.
BCL2 gene rearrangement also occurs in 20% to 30% of
cases of DLBCL.11,13,16-20,27 Clinical studies investigating
the prognostic impact of BCL2 and BCL6 gene rearrangements on patients of DLBCL have yielded conflicting
results.11,13,16-20,25,27,34,35 Conversely, there are very few
data on the prognostic impact of chromosomal translocations involving MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 genes in patients
with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP.13,21,24,35
In this study, the frequency of MYC, BCL2, and
BCL6 rearrangements was investigated in DLBCLs using
interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In addition, the clinicopathological features and
prognostic implications of these gene aberrations in
DLBCLs treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy were
examined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

whereas 29 patients were treated with CHOP or CHOPlike chemotherapy regimens, and 4 patients received palliative therapy only. The characteristics of the patients who
received R-CHOP therapy were similar to the remaining
cases. For the purpose of achieving homogeneity of the
patient population, the survival analysis was constructed
from 145 patients who had been uniformly treated with
R-CHOP therapy. This group consisted of 69 males and
76 females, with a median age of 56 years (range, 17-95).
The median follow-up for this group was 26 months
(range, 2-96). At the time of analysis, 43 (30%) of 145
patients had died, and 102 (70%) were reported to be
alive.
This retrospective study was approved by the Gazi
University Medical School Research Ethics Board and is
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Immunohistochemistry

The hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each tumor block were reviewed, and representative areas with
the highest percentage of tumor cells were selected for tissue microarray (TMA) construction. TMA blocks were
constructed with a tissue microarrayer. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-lm TMA sections using
CD10, BCL6, MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, and Ki-67. The sections were stained using automated immunohistochemistry on the Ventana Benchmark XT using standard
protocols. Immunoreactivity was determined without any
knowledge of survival or other clinical data. The cases
were then subclassified as GC and non-GC phenotype
using the algorithm described by Hans and colleagues.7
For evaluation of CD10, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM1/
IRF4, the staining was interpreted as positive if 30% or
more of the tumor cells showed expression.7 The Ki-67
antibody was used to determine the proliferation rate, and
Ki-67 80% was defined as ‘‘high proliferation’’ as previously described.36

Patients

Biopsies from 250 DLBCL patients diagnosed from January 2001 to June 2009 in the Pathology Departments of
Gazi and Hacettepe Universities were included in this
study. The diagnosis of DLBCL was based on the 2008
WHO classification criteria, and BL cases were excluded.
Of the 250 patients, 239 cases in which FISH was successfully performed were analyzed in this study. These cases
included 117 males and 122 females, with a median age of
57 years (range, 16-95). Follow-up data were available for
178 of these patients. Clinical data were obtained from
the referring oncologists and medical records. One hundred forty-five patients received R-CHOP therapy,

FISH Analysis

Interphase FISH analysis was performed on 3-lm TMA
tissue sections using split signal FISH DNA probes for
MYC/8q24, BCL2/18q21, and BCL6/3q27 (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The slides were analyzed with an Olympus
BX-51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). At least 100 intact, nonoverlapping nuclei were
assessed by 2 pathologists, and the percentages of positive
nuclei were averaged. A sample was considered positive
for the rearrangement if >10% of nuclei exhibited breaking apart.

Statistical Analysis

Pearson chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to test
for differences in the frequencies between groups. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney
U test. Spearman test was used to analyze correlations
between different variables.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
time interval from initial diagnosis to progressive disease
under therapy, failure to achieve complete remission,
additional therapy, relapse, or death from any cause.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from initial
diagnosis to death or the last contact. Patients were censored for OS at the time of the last contact if currently
alive and for PFS if no relapse or disease progression had
occurred at the time of their last visit. PFS and OS were
estimated according to Kaplan-Meier and compared by
log-rank test. Multivariate analyses were performed with
the use of a Cox regression model to estimate hazard ratios
for an evolving event. All P values are based on 2-tailed
statistical analysis, considering P values <.05 as significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 15.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) statistical software.

RESULTS
FISH was successfully performed in 239 cases, which were
analyzed in this study (Table 1). A GC phenotype was
found in 49% and a non-GC phenotype in 51% of the
tumors, as defined by the Hans’ algorithm. No significant
differences were observed with regard to age (<60 vs 60
years), sex, primary site of presentation (nodal vs extranodal), stage (I-II vs III-IV), IPI (low- vs high-risk), or high
Ki-67 proliferation index among GC and non-GC subgroups. However, BCL2 protein was expressed in a higher
proportion of non-GC than GC DLBCLs (P ¼ .03).
MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 Rearrangements

MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene rearrangements were
observed in 6%, 15%, and 29% of the cases, respectively
(Table 1). There was no significant difference between
GC and non-GC phenotype cases with regard to MYC,
BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements.
MYC Rearrangements

MYC rearrangements were observed in 14 (6%) of 239
DLBCL patients (Fig. 1A). MYC rearrangement was
more frequent in the high-risk IPI group (P ¼ .04). Cases

Survival Analysis

We studied clinicopathological characteristics and their
association with PFS and OS by univariate analysis for
145 R-CHOP–treated patients (Table 2). Among clinical
parameters, an IPI score >2 (high-risk IPI) was associated
with worse OS (P < .001), as was advanced stage (stage
III or IV, P ¼ .03). By univariate analysis, CD10, BCL6,
MUM1/IRF4, and BCL2 expressions and high proliferation rate were not prognostic for PFS or OS. Similarly, no
significant difference in PFS (P ¼ .1) or OS (P ¼ .3) was
observed between the GC and non-GC phenotypes.
Considering FISH analysis, patients with MYC gene
rearrangements had significantly worse OS (P ¼ .01;
Fig. 3A) than those without MYC rearrangement, but not
PFS (P ¼ .1). In particular, when analyzed according to
GC and non-GC phenotypes, the prognostic implication
of MYC rearrangement was statistically significant only
for the GC phenotype, in which patients with MYC rearrangement had significantly shorter OS (P ¼ .009) and
tended to have worse PFS (P ¼ .09). However, no significant prognostic impact of MYC rearrangement on PFS (P
¼ .6) or OS (P ¼ .1) was observed for the patients with
non-GC phenotype.
BCL6 rearrangement had a significantly unfavorable
impact on OS (P ¼ .04; Fig. 3B) but not on PFS (P ¼ .1).
When analyzed according to GC and non-GC phenotypes, cases with BCL6 rearrangement had significantly
inferior OS (P ¼ .03) if they had non-GC phenotype, but
not if they had GC phenotype (P ¼ .3). BCL2 rearrangement was not significantly associated with PFS (P ¼ .4) or
OS (P ¼ .2; Fig. 3C) in either the GC or the non-GC
subgroup.
All 6 patients with double-hit lymphoma (BCL2/
MYC or BCL6/MYC rearrangements) were treated with
R-CHOP, and 1 patient with triple-hit lymphoma
(BCL2/BCL6/MYC rearrangements) received only
CHOP chemotherapy. The prognosis of the cases with
double-hit lymphoma and triple-hit lymphoma was
extremely poor, with a median survival of 9 months and a
2-year OS rate of 14% (PFS, P ¼ .003 and OS, P < .001;
Fig. 4). Only 1 BCL2/MYC double-hit lymphoma case
was currently in complete remission at 30 months after
the diagnosis.
In a multivariate analysis incorporating IPI, stage,
and BCL6 and MYC rearrangements, only IPI (P ¼ .01)
and MYC rearrangement (P ¼ .02) remained as independent prognostic factors for OS, whereas the prognostic
significance of BCL6 rearrangement disappeared. With
respect to PFS, only IPI (P ¼ .001) was independently
associated with PFS.

DISCUSSION
Several studies have examined the prognostic factors for
predicting survival and for determining optimal therapeutic strategies in DLBCL. In the present study, GC/nonGC phenotype according to Hans’ algorithm had no
prognostic impact, in agreement with the majority of
studies among R-CHOP–treated patients.13-15,37 This
might be explained by the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy, as it may modify the prognostic impact of
BCL6 or BCL2 protein expressions.13,34,35
Recently, the prognostic impact of chromosomal
translocations involving MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 genes
have been widely investigated in DLBCLs, but only a
small number of studies have been conducted in the rituximab era (Table 3).13,16,19-25,35,38 In this study, the freCancer

September 1, 2012

quency of MYC rearrangement was 6%, which is
comparable to the previous studies, which have reported
in 3% to 16% of DLBCL.13,18,21-27 Several studies have
analyzed the clinicopathologic presentations predicting
the likelihood of MYC rearrangement. MYC rearrangement was significantly associated with a high proliferation
rate, whereas the other studies did not show any correlation between a high proliferation rate and the presence of
MYC rearrangement.21-24
In this study, MYC-rearranged DLBCLs were more
frequently found in the high-risk IPI group. Barrans and
colleagues found patients with MYC-rearranged DLBCL
were significantly associated with an advanced stage and a
higher IPI score.21 Niitsu and colleagues showed that
patients with MYC-rearranged DLBCL significantly

correlated with poor performance status, bone marrow
involvement, high IPI score, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels.23 On the basis of these findings, one can recommend the routine screening for MYC rearrangements

lymphoma (DHL) shows inferior survival to that of the other

in DLBCL cases, with high-risk features and/or a high
proliferation rate.
DLBCL with MYC rearrangements has a poor prognosis, with outcomes that are inferior to both BL and to
other types of DLBCL. When treated with CHOP-like or
augmented CHOP-like regimens, the 5-year survival is
only 44% compared with 67% for DLBCL without a
MYC aberration.23 Furthermore, the negative impact of
MYC expression supersedes the favorable prognosis of
GC phenotype of DLBCL, with significantly inferior
event-free survival and OS compared with either non-GC
phenotype or non–MYC-associated DLBCL treated with
CHOP.22
The presence of MYC rearrangement retains its negative prognostic significance even in patients treated with
rituximab and anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy, and is an independent predictor of outcome in
DLBCL.21,24 In our study, patients with MYC gene rearrangement showed significantly worse OS than nonrearranged patients, especially in GC phenotype DLBCL.
The MYC rearrangement and IPI score remained as independent prognostic indicators by multivariate analysis in
this study. Savage and colleagues found that for DLBCL,

MYC, BCL2, BCL6 Rearrangements in DLBCL/Akyurek et al

MYC rearrangements had a negative prognostic impact by
multivariate analysis for both PFS and OS, as well as a
higher risk of central nervous system relapse even when
treated with R-CHOP.24
Even in pediatric patients with DLBCL, the presence
of 8q24 rearrangements independently reduces event-free
survival by 6-fold.39 By contrast, Copie-Bergman and colleagues found that presence of MYC rearrangement did not
predict shortened OS in DLBCLs treated with R-CHOP.13
Half of our cases with MYC rearrangement also had
BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements. The poor clinical
outcome of the group of tumors with MYC rearrangement
is likely to be a consequence of the synergistic interaction
between multiple dysregulated genes.
Because of the very poor outcome and resistance to
lower-dose therapies, an intensive chemotherapy regimen
used for BL (CODOX-M/IVAC) has been examined in
patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas characterized
by complex patterns of cytogenetic abnormalities, but this
therapy did not improve survival in this group of patients
in 1 study.40
BCL6 gene rearrangement is the most common
chromosomal translocation identified in DLBCL, occurring in up to 30% to 35% of cases.13,16,18,19,27,38 The frequency of BCL6 rearrangement was 29% in our study. It
has been reported that BCL6 rearrangement occurs more
frequently in patients with extranodal disease and, interestingly, has an association with non-GC phenotype.13,16,18,19,38 However, in our study, no significant
correlation was found between BCL6 rearrangement and
the site of presentation. We also did not find a correlation
between BCL6 rearrangement and BCL6 protein expression, consistent with recent observations.19,35 It has been
suggested that BCL6 rearrangements does not directly
lead to BCL6 expression. However, BCL6 mutations and
a number of alternative translocation partners may be
related to deregulation of BCL6 expression.38 Ohno and
colleagues found that nonimmunoglobulin/BCL6 translocation correlated with low-level BCL6 protein expression, and was associated with a poor prognosis.41
Different studies investigating the prognostic significance of the BCL6 rearrangement in DLBCL have
yielded conflicting results, which probably reflects the heterogeneity of the disease and various molecular techniques
used. For example, BCL6 rearrangement has been associated with a favorable prognosis in DLBCL patients treated
with CHOP-like chemotherapy in some studies, but not
in others.11,16,18,19,38
In the present study, BCL6 rearrangement was also
associated with an inferior outcome in patients treated

with R-CHOP on univariate analysis, but was not an independent prognostic factor. Otherwise, BCL6 rearrangement did not correlate with the presence of high-risk
clinical features. In agreement with our results, investigators have reported results of 2 other large series and have
also demonstrated that BCL6 rearrangement is associated
with significantly worse OS in patients treated with RCHOP.13,35 Shustik and colleagues noted that BCL6 rearrangement correlated with the presence of high-risk clinical features, but was not a prognostic factor independent
of the IPI score.35 Although we did not find any correlation among BCL6 rearrangement and GC/non-GC phenotype, the poor survival effect of BCL6 rearrangement
was particularly evident in non-GC phenotype DLBCL
in our study. Thus, BCL6 rearrangement could be a biomarker of more aggressive disease in the non-GC
subgroup.
In the present study, the frequency of BCL2 rearrangement was 15% in DLBCL patients. Moreover, no
significant difference in the frequency of BCL2 rearrangement was observed between GC and non-GC phenotype
cases. However, we observed that BCL2 rearrangement
correlated with BCL2 protein expression, which was more
frequently observed in non-GC phenotype cases. It has
been suggested that alternative mechanisms other than
(14;18)(q32;q21), such as 18q21 amplification or activation of nuclear factor-jB pathway, may be primarily responsible for the up-regulation of BCL2 expression in the
non-GC subgroup.42 In our cohort, 24% of DLBCL cases
showed amplification at BCL2 locus (data not shown). Of
these cases, roughly 2/3 had non-GC phenotype, and 1/3
had GC phenotype. This observation lends further evidence to the presence of alternative mechanisms for BCL2
overexpression in non-GC DLBCL. The prognostic role
of BCL2 rearrangement is still controversial. In the present study, BCL2 rearrangement was not predictive of OS
in patients treated with R-CHOP, in accordance with
most reports.11,13,18,43 Barrans and colleagues demonstrated that GC type DLBCL patients with t(14;18) had
significantly worse survival.20
Double-hit and triple-hit lymphomas are rare neoplasms, with estimated frequencies ranging from 1% to
12% of DLBCLs. BCL2/MYC double-hit lymphomas
(62%) formed the great majority of double-hit lymphomas. BCL6/MYC double-hit lymphomas were relatively
rare (8% of all cases), and triple-hit lymphomas that
involved BCL2/BCL6/MYC (16%) were more frequent
than BCL6/MYC double-hit lymphoma cases in these
studies.11,21,24-27 In our study, in accordance with the
reported cases in the literature, most patients presented as
4181

Original Article

de novo DLBCL.29-32 However, in a recent study on 20
patients with BCL2/MYC double-hit lymphoma, lowgrade follicular lymphoma history was reported in 6
(30%) of the cases.44
In conclusion, our findings and other studies confirm that double-hit and triple-hit lymphomas are characterized by aggressive clinical behaviors. Patients usually
present with poor prognostic parameters, including
advanced stage, B symptoms, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, poor performance status, bone marrow and central
nervous system involvement, and a high IPI score.
Patients with these lymphomas have poor prognosis and
resistance to multiagent chemotherapy, even if treated
with R-CHOP or high-intensity treatment regimens.
This poor outcome is likely related to synergistic action of
MYC-induced growth promotion and the antiapoptotic
effect provided by BCL2. The presence of MYC rearrangement in DLBCL was associated with a poor prognosis,
and is an independent predictor of shortened OS in the
R-CHOP treatment era. Because there are no clinical,
morphological, or immunophenotypic features to identify
such cases, all DLBCL cases should be analyzed for MYC
abnormality using FISH, especially if the proliferation
index is >80%. In addition, determination of BCL2 and
BCL6 rearrangements is also imperative to identify double-hit and triple-hit lymphoma, which have clinically
more aggressive behavior and extremely poor prognosis.
BCL6 rearrangement was also associated with worse prognosis in DLBCL, particularly in the non-GC subgroup.
Patients with these abnormalities have a poor response to
R-CHOP, and novel therapeutic approaches should be
developed for these cases.
