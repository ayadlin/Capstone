ABSTRACT
Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells (MSC) are currently being explored in
diverse clinical applications, including regenerative therapies. Their contribution to
regeneration of bone fractures is dependent on their capacity to proliferate, undergo
osteogenesis and induce angiogenesis. This study aimed to uncover microRNAs
capable of concomitantly regulate these mechanisms. Following microRNA array
results, we identified miR-195 and miR-497 as downregulated in human primary MSC
under osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR-195 or miR-497 in human
primary MSC leads to a decrease in osteogenic differentiation and proliferation rate.
Conversely, inhibition of miR-195 increased alkaline phosphatase expression and
activity and cells proliferation. Then, miR-195 was used to study MSC capacity to
recruit blood vessels in vivo. We provide evidence that the paracrine effect of MSC
on angiogenesis is diminished when cells over-express miR-195. VEGF may partially
mediate this effect, as its expression and secreted protein levels are reduced by miR195, while increased by anti-miR-195, in human MSC. Luciferase reporter assays
revealed a direct interaction between miR-195 and VEGF 3´-UTR in bone cancer cells.
In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-195 regulates important mechanisms
for bone regeneration, specifically MSC osteogenic differentiation, proliferation and
control of angiogenesis; therefore, it is a potential target for clinical bone regenerative
therapies.

INTRODUCTION

several connective tissues [1, 2] and can be isolated and
expanded in vitro. This, together with their paracrine
effect on immune response modulation and angiogenesis
stimulation, makes MSC attractive candidates for clinical
applications [1]. Patients suffering from delayed or
impaired healing, which accounts for 5-10% of patients
with bone fractures [3, 4], as well as patients who
suffer from bone diseases such as osteoporosis, could
potentially benefit from MSC-associated therapies [5,

During bone regeneration, three main phases,
inflammation, new bone formation and bone remodeling
take place in an orchestrated fashion to repair the injury.
Human multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells
(MSC) are progenitor cells capable to differentiate into
multiple cell lineages, including bone, cartilage, fat, and
muscle [1, 2]. MSC are present in bone marrow and in

6, 7]. Consequently, modulation of gene expression of
MSC at the bone fracture site is emerging as an attractive
approach for the improvement of bone fracture healing
and for the therapy of bone-related diseases [5, 8]. Such
strategy would be particularly important for the elderly
population who not only have an increased risk of bone
fractures but also have their bone regenerative capacity
compromised [9].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs,
approximately 22-nucleotides (nt) long, that control gene
expression at the post-transcription level by binding to
5´untranslated region (UTR), coding regions or 3´UTR of
messenger RNAs (mRNA). Upon binding, miRNAs inhibit
mRNA translation or cause mRNA degradation [10].
miRNAs regulate virtually all cellular mechanisms and are
deregulated in several human diseases, including cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, among
others [10]. Proof-of-concept of pre-clinical application
of miRNAs was achieved by the demonstration that a
locked nucleic acid-modified antisense oligonucleotide
designed against miR-122 was able to suppress hepatitis
C virus (HCV) viremia without side effects in primates
[11]. Later, anti-miR-122 therapy was tested in human
HCV patients and resulted in a dose-dependent reduction
in HCV RNA levels and no adverse effects [12], opening
an avenue for the use of miRNA-associated therapies in
humans. In regenerative medicine, miRNA therapies are
not yet translated into the clinics but are an emerging and
exciting area of research [13]. Interestingly, modulation
of a single miRNA can improve treatments. This effect
may be explained by the fact that a single miRNAs is
able to regulate a large number of mRNAs. Consequently,
manipulation of the expression of a single miRNA may
affect simultaneously several biological processes,
including osteogenesis and angiogenesis, which are
two coupled mechanisms absolutely required for bone
formation [14, 15, 16, 17].
The aim of this work is to identify miRNAs that
orchestrate crucial events in bone regeneration/repair. By
modulating the levels of a single miRNA we intend to act
synergistically on central functions for bone regenerative
therapies, including MSC osteogenic differentiation, MSC
proliferation and MSC ability to control angiogenesis.

material and a representative pattern MC3T3, a preosteoblast cell line, was used for the array.
To confirm osteogenic differentiation, cultures
were set up in parallel to follow the classical osteogenic
differentiation markers. Results obtained show, as
expected, that after 7 days stimulating cells with
osteogenic-inducing supplements, activity of Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALP, a membrane-bound metalloenzyme
which is considered an early osteogenic differentiation
marker) was strongly increased, visible as the formation
of a red insoluble product after incubation with Fast Violet
B salt /Naphthol AS-MX (Figure 1A). Also, after 14 days
of osteogenic differentiation, MC3T3 cells exhibited
calcium-rich deposits (mineralization) visualized upon
Alizarin Red S staining (Figure 1A). ALP activity and
mineralization were not detected in cells grown without
osteogenic-inducing supplements (basal condition) (Figure
1A). Furthermore, to confirm osteogenic gene expression
program, expression levels of key genes directing bone
formation were analyzed by RT-qPCR: ALP, RUNX2 and
OSX expression levels were upregulated, particularly
at day 3 of the differentiation process, while the late
osteogenic marker OPN was upregulated after 7 and 14
days of culture with osteogenic-inducing supplements
(Figure 1B). Cultures in the same conditions were used
to perform a miRNA expression profile by microarrays, at
days 3 and 7 of differentiation, which was compared with
the miRNA profile of cells grown under basal conditions
(Figure 1C). In total, 358 miRNAs were analyzed.
Considering absolute values of log fold change
larger than 1, seven miRNAs (mmu-miR-2137, mmumiR-204-5p, mmu-miR-762, mmu-miR-146b-5p, mmumiR-711, mmu-miR-222-3p, mmu-miR-25-5p) were
differently expressed after 7 days, while two miRNAs
(mmu-miR-3473b, mmu-miR-204-5p) were differently
expressed after 3 days of osteogenic differentiation versus
basal conditions at the same time points (Supplementary
Table 1). As small differences in miRNA levels can have
a major impact on cell mechanisms and phenotypes, for
array validation we not only considered high differently
expressed miRNAs but we also randomly selected
miRNAs with log fold change larger than 0.4. In total, ten
miRNAs were selected for validation in 3 independent
experiments using RT-qPCR. During MC3T3 osteogenic
differentiation, miR-29b-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-204
expression was upregulated, both at day 3 and at day 7
of differentiation, while miR-146b-5p and miR-20a5p were upregulated only at day 7 of differentiation,
which is in agreement with microarray results (Figure
2A; Supplementary Figure 1). On the other hand, miR143-3p, miR-195a-5p and miR-497-5p expression was
downregulated in osteo- versus basal condition at day
7 but not at day 3 (Figure 2A). These differences are
consistent with the array results (Supplementary Table 1).
Conversely, miR-33a-5p and miR-711 were expressed at
very low levels with Cq values higher than 35 cycles and,

consequently, array results were not confirmed for these
miRNAs.
Although some miRNAs are conserved through
evolution, their regulation and target genes may differ
from mouse to human, so it was fundamental to determine

miRNAs expression during human MSC osteogenic
differentiation. For this purpose, bone marrow derived
primary human MSC from different donors were used.
Cells were incubated with osteogenic supplements and
allowed to differentiate up to 28 days. Differentiation

was confirmed, as in osteogenic-supplemented cells ALP
activity increased, mineralization was present and ALP
gene expression increased, compared with cells grown
in basal conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). miRNA
expression levels in osteogenic stimulated primary
human MSC were compared with basal control (without
osteogenic supplements) at 5 different time points (3, 7,
14, 21, and 28 days). Results obtained show that miR29b-3p, miR-29c-3p and miR-20a-5p were upregulated
upon osteogenic differentiation, while miR-143-3p, miR195-5p and miR-497-5p were downregulated (Figure 2B).
Notably, downregulation of miR-195-5p was consistent
and significant along all differentiation time points (Figure
2B). Upregulation of miR-146b-5p and miR-204 was
not demonstrated in primary human MSC osteogenesis
(Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 1). The levels of
miR-33a-5p and miR-711 in primary human MSC were
undetectable by RT-qPCR.
Among the analyzed miRNAs, miR-195-5p (and
the genomic closely located miR-497-5p - Supplementary
Figure 3) were selected for further analysis since 1) this
is the first report showing downregulation of miR-195-5p
in human primary MSCs under osteogenic differentiation
conditions versus basal control, 2) the profile is consistent
for all MSC donors during 28 days, and 3) other biological
mechanisms for this miRNA in primary human MSC are
still unexplored.

differentiation supplements (Figure 3D). This result
further strengthens the impact of miR-195 on osteogenic
differentiation. Therefore, we concluded that miR-195
and miR-497 play an anti-osteogenic differentiation role
in human primary MSC cells.
The same effect was observed during osteogenic
differentiation of MC3T3. Cells were transfected with
either SCR, miR-143 (used as a positive control), miR195 or miR-497. ALP staining levels decreased to 21%
and 60% in miR-195 and miR-497 transfected cells,
respectively, compared with SCR control (Supplementary
Figure 5A). In agreement, early osteogenic differentiation
markers ALP, RUNX2, OSX expression levels were
decreased (Supplementary Figure 5B).

miR-195 and miR-497 affects cell proliferation of
primary human MSC
To characterize the impact of miR-195 and miR497 on MSC biology, we next investigated their impact
on cell proliferation. The resazurin reduction assay,
where active viable cells reduce the non-fluorescent dye
resazurin to the strongly-fluorescent dye resorufin, was
used as an indirect assessment of cell proliferation. In two
independent experiments, we measured cell viability in
miR-195 and miR-497-electroporated human MSC. Cell
viability was significantly decreased in miR-195 and miR497-overexpressing MSC (P < 0.001) in comparison with
the SCR control (Figure 4A).
To further confirm if cell proliferation was indeed
affected by miR-195 and miR-497, staining with the
proliferation marker Ki-67 was quantified. Ki-67 positive
cells were counted and normalized to the total number
of cells (DAPI positive cells). Ki-67+/DAPI+ levels
were significantly reduced in miR-195 and miR-497electroporated cells compared with SCR control 48h
post-electroporation (P < 0.05) (Figure 4B). Therefore,
miR-195 and miR-497 impaired MSC proliferation.
Additionally, significantly more nuclei (DAPI+) were
detected in SCR control cells (P < 0.05) (Figure 4B)
when compared with the number of nuclei in miRNAelectroporated cells, which further supports the effect
of these miRNAs on MSC proliferation. The difference
in proliferative cells (Ki-67+/DAPI+) is evident even
96h after electroporation (P < 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure 6). Furthermore, the specific effect of miR-195 on
proliferation was confirmed, as treatment with miR-195
antagonist (anti-miR-195) significantly increased Ki-67+/
DAPI+ levels, compared with control (P < 0.05) (Figure
4C).
In conclusion, our data shows that both miR-195
and miR-497 decrease cell proliferation in human primary
MSC.

miR-195 and miR-497 modulates osteogenic
differentiation in primary human MSC and
mouse MC3T3 cell line
To further elucidate the impact of miR-195 and miR497 during osteogenic differentiation of human primary
MSC, these were successfully electroporated with SCR
control, miR-195 or miR-497 (P < 0.05) (Figure 3A) and
allowed to differentiate with osteogenic supplements up to
7 days. miR-195 and miR-497- overexpressing cells did
not show ALP activity (negative for ALP staining) while
SCR control MSC showed positive ALP staining in 9% of
the well surface (Figure 3B). This result is in agreement
with the significant reduction in ALP mRNA expression
level in miR-195 and in miR-497-electroporated cells
compared with SCR control (P < 0.05) (Figure 3C).
Moreover, expression levels of the key osteogenic
differentiation marker RUNX2 was diminished in miR195 and miR-497-electropotared cells compared with SCR
control (P < 0.05) (Figure 3C). To further test the specific
effect of miR-195 on osteogenesis, we successfully
transfected cells with anti-miR-195 (Supplementary
Figure 4) and analyzed its effect on the early osteogenic
marker ALP. Results showed a significant increase of 1.9fold in ALP expression level (P < 0.05) and enhanced
ALP activity in anti-miR-195-MSC when compared
with control, 5 days after stimulation with osteogenic

Angiogenesis is decreased by miR-195 and miR497 expression in primary human MSC

Human primary MSCs were electroporated
with either miR-195 or SCR control. After 72 hours,
conditioned media was collected, concentrated and
placed on top of E10 growing CAM. Two independent
experiments were performed and a total of 24 eggs were
used per condition. Out of those, 23 eggs survived with
SCR-conditioned media and 21 eggs survived with miR195-conditioned media although only 19 allowed the
reading for evaluation of the angiogenic response. Our

Considering that an adequate angiogenic response
is crucial for successful bone healing [18] and knowing
that MSC are able to recruit and induce formation of new
vessels during bone regeneration [14, 15], we investigated
the impact of miR-195 and miR-497 on this biological
process.

results showed a statistically significant decrease of 28%
(Mean ± SEM SCR: 8,000 ± 0,5146 N = 23, miR-195:
5,737 ± 0,3734 N = 19; P < 0.01) in the endothelial vessels
growth induced by miR-195 MSC conditioned media
compared with SCR control MSC conditioned media
(Figure 5A, 5B). In conclusion, expression of miR-195 in
MSC regulates the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells.
This assay was also performed using conditioned
media from MSCs electroporated with either miR-497 or
SCR control. Our results showed a statistically significant
decrease of 12% (Mean ± SEM SCR: 10,60 ± 0,3352 N
= 15, miR-497: 9,313 ± 0,3950 N = 16; P < 0.05) in the
endothelial vessels growth induced by miR-497 MSC
conditioned media compared with SCR control MSC
conditioned media (Supplementary Figure 7). Taken
together, the in vivo CAM assay results suggest miR-195
negatively impacts angiogenesis to a greater extent than
miR-497.
Additionally, we tested whether VEGF, a known key
angiogenic mediator [14, 15], was able to rescue the effect
of this miRNA on angiogenesis in vivo. An independent
CAM assay experiment was performed and results are
shown in Figure 5C. Interestingly, VEGF was able to
dose-dependently revert the decrease in the number of new
blood vessels caused by miR-195-MSC conditioned media.
When compared to miR-195-MSC conditioned media, low
doses of VEGF produced a slight recovery, while high
levels of VEGF significantly increased the number of
vessels (P < 0.05), restoring the number of vessels formed
in response to SCR control condition media (Mean ± SEM

miR-195 decreased VEGF expression and MSCsecreted VEGF levels

Increased risk of bone fracture is associated with
aging and the regenerative capacity is reduced in the
elderly [9]. New clinical strategies are currently being
developed to improve bone regeneration and, among
those, modulation of miRNA levels has been investigated
[13]. Beyond their role as regulators of the immune
response, MSC therapeutic effect for bone regeneration
is likely related to their capacity to proliferate, undergo
osteogenic differentiation and control angiogenesis [22].
In this study, we analyzed the ability of miRNAs to
regulate these processes.
Firstly, miRNA profiling of cells under osteogenic
differentiation stimuli versus non-stimulated cells was
obtained and then the microarray data was validated
by RT-qPCR in mouse pre-osteoblasts and in human
bone marrow-derived primary MSC. Upregulation of
miR-20a during human osteogenic differentiation was
previously described by Zhang et al. [23]. Therefore,
we analyzed miR-20a expression in our MSC samples
as a positive control. Moreover, miR-146b expression

miR-195 directly targets VEGF
To test if miR-195 directly binds VEGF in bone
cells luciferase assays were performed in U-2 OS cells.
Luciferase levels were significantly reduced when cells
were co-transfected with pGL3-VEGF binding site
construct and miR-195 compared with control. However,
this difference was abolished when the binding site was
mutated suggesting a specific VEGF::miR-195 direct
interaction (Figure 6C). The same results were obtained
when using HeLa cells, which is a cell line commonly
used in human in vitro studies (Figure 6C).
Also, SMAD family member 5 (SMAD5) and
Homeobox A10 (HOXA10) genes, located in chromosome
5 and chromosome 7, respectively, have been described
as regulators of osteogenesis and/or angiogenesis [19, 20,
21]. Both genes were predicted to be targeted by miR195 (Supplementary Figure 8). Potential interaction site
was cloned into PGL3 vector. Luciferase levels of pGL3SMAD5 and PGL3-HOXA10 or mutated constructs cotransfected with miR-195 were not altered compared with
control (Figure 6D, 6E). On the other hand, mRNA levels
of SMAD5 and HOX10A were decreased after miR-195
MSC electroporation, while increased after anti-miR-195
MSC tranfection (Figure 6F, 6G), indicating that miR195 controls SMAD5 and HOXA10 expression but it
does not directly interact with SMAD5 and HOXA10.
However, we cannot exclude the hypothesis of a direct
SMAD5::miR-195 and HOXA10::miR-195 interaction in
other mRNA sites or cells lines.

DISCUSSION

We next investigated VEGF as a potential target
for miR-195. In fact, in silico predictions using different
algorithms indicate miR-195 targets VEGF 3´UTR
(Supplementary Figure 8). To test if VEGF levels were
altered by miR-195, RNA was isolated from MSC 48h
after miR-195 electroporation. VEGF expression levels
were significantly decreased in miR-195 MSC versus
SCR control (P < 0.01) (Figure 6A). Conversely, MSC
transfected with anti-miR-195 expressed higher levels of
VEGF than control (P < 0,05) (Figure 6A).
Also, levels of VEGF secreted protein, which
are important for vessels formation, were measured by
ELISA. Concentration of secreted VEGF was significantly
decreased in miR-195 electroporated MSC versus control
(P < 0.05) (Figure 6B). On the other hand, VEGF was
found to be increased in cell culture supernatants of MSC

levels during MC3T3 osteogenic differentiation were
upregulated compared with controls, but this profile was
not confirmed for human MSC differentiation. This is
not surprising as regulation of human and mouse miRNA
may differ [24]. Also, miRNA targets in both species
may be totally different, which reinforces the importance
of studies using human primary cells. Furthermore,
validation of our miRNA-microarray results by RT-qPCR
confirmed miR-29b and miR-29c as positive regulators
of osteoblast differentiation in the mouse cell line,
which is in agreement with previous reports and further
strengthen the quality/relevance the array data [25, 26].
However, studies on human MSC were missing. This
is the first report demonstrating miR-29b and miR-29c
upregulation during osteogenic differentiation in human
primary MSC. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-143
levels are consistently decreased in MSC after 14 days of
differentiation in human cells, suggesting that this miRNA
negatively regulates late mineralization stages.
Within the analyzed miRNAs, miR-195 was the
only one consistently and significantly downregulated in
human MSC under osteogenic stimuli compared with nonstimulated cells in all time points and, for this reason, was
further explored. Interestingly, miR-195 is located within
less than 10kb distance from miR-497, in chromosome 17
(sequence details are shown in Supplementary Table 2).
In vitro results indicate both miRNA are able to suppress
osteogenic differentiation in human primary MSC. A
recent study by Grünhagen et al. showed that miR-195miR-497 cluster impaired osteoblast differentiation in
mouse cells [27]. Thus, in general terms, the miR-195 and
miR-497 regulation of osteogenic differentiation are likely
conserved from mouse to human.
However, different biological processes beyond
MSC differentiation contribute to bone regeneration, and
differences in a single miRNA may affect simultaneously
distinct biological mechanisms [28]. So, the potential
involvement of miRNA in MSC proliferation and their
capacity to promote angiogenesis were also studied. Gainof-function studies revealed miR-195 (and the clustered
miR-497) decreased cell proliferation, as determined by
significant decreases in the number of positive cells for
the cellular proliferation marker Ki-67, which is present
during all active phases of the cell cycle, and in the overall
number of cells. As expected, miR-195 knockdown
increased MSC proliferation. Growth-suppressive
properties of miR-195 have been mainly described for
tumor cells, particularly for hepatocellular carcinoma
[29, 30], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [31], nonsmall cell lung cancer [32, 33, 34] and colorectal cancer
[35]. To the best of our knowledge our study is the first
to describe the role of miR-195 in the proliferation of
human primary non-malignant and non-transformed cells.
This effect in not likely to be explained by extracellular
VEGF as no differences in MSC proliferation were found
when recombinant VEGF was added to our MSC primary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cultures (data not shown). Considering that this miRNA
has multiple targets, some with potential effects on cell
proliferation, it is reasonable to expect that this effect may
be mediated by other miR-195 targets acting intracellularly
(e.g. SMAD5 or HOXA10 related pathways).
Formation of new blood vessels is an essential
process for tissue regeneration, as it mediates the transport
of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors and circulating
cells [36, 37]. For this reason, the effect of miR-195 on
angiogenesis was tested in vivo, using the chicken CAM
assay model. We concluded that miR-195 decreased
significantly the number of vessels formed in response
to MSC conditioned medium. This biological effect is
crucial for bone formation and may be partially explained
by the ability of miR-195 to target VEGF. Moreover, other
proteins in the supernatants, which could be miR-195
direct or indirect targets, may have a synergistic effect on
angiogenesis inhibition.
Interestingly, coupling of angiogenesis and
osteogenesis is supported by several reports [16, 17]. In
vitro, inhibition of VEGF decreases nodule formation and
ALP activity in primary human osteoblasts [38]. In vivo,
VEGF stimulates repair of femoral fracture and cortical
bone defect in mice model and radius critical size defect
in rabbit model [38]. Additionally, MSC with reduced
expression of VEGF inhibited osteoblast differentiation
by decreasing RUNX2 levels and mice with low VEGF
expression in osteoblastic lineage cells lead to reduced
bone density in mice [39]. In agreement, VEGF expression
is reduced during aging [40].
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates
that miR-195 (and the clustered miR-497 gene) acts as
a negative regulator of osteogenesis in human primary
bone marrow MSC, an inhibitor of MSC proliferative
capacity and an anti-angiogenic player. All together,
these results indicate miR-195 as a potential target for
enhancing regeneration of human bone defects (or bonedegenerative diseases, such as osteoporosis). Efficient in
vivo therapeutic delivery and specific cellular uptake of
miRNAs antagonists for clinical application is in progress
[41]. Considering the biological effect and targets of miR195, future studies should address in vivo delivery of antimiR-195 oligonucleotides into bone injury scenarios.

Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

Procedures were approved by the ethics committee and
informed consent was obtained from all donors included
in this study. Isolation and purity of MSCs was confirmed
by flow cytometry after staining of surface CD105, CD73,
CD90 (positive markers) and CD45, CD34, CD14, CD19
and HLA-DR (negative markers), and by testing cells
ability to differentiate in osteoblasts, chondroblasts or
adipocytes [17, 43].
Commercial human primary MSC for miRNA
electroporation were acquired from Lonza.

RNA was treated with TURBO DNA-free Kit (Life
Technologies) and complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthesized using Random Hexamers (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies), dNTPs (Bioline) and SuperScript® III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies).
qPCR was carried out in iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad) using cDNA, primers and iQ SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primers for qPCR experiments
are shown in Supplementary Table 3.
miRNA expression was evaluated using TaqMan
miRNA assays (Life Technologies). Briefly, cDNA was
synthesized using 20 ng of RNA as a template, genespecific stem-loop Reverse Transcription primer, and
the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Life
Technologies). qPCR was carried out in iQ5 Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using cDNA, TaqMan
probe and SsoAdvanced™ Universal Probes Supermix
(Bio-Rad). Small nuclear RNA U6 was used as reference
gene.
Experiments were performed in duplicate. Relative
expression levels were calculated using the quantification
cycle (Cq) method, according to MIQE guidelines [45].

Cell lines
Pre-osteoblast mouse cell line MC3T3-E1 subclone
4 (ATCC) was grown in alpha- Minimum Essential
Medium (Gibco). U-2 OS and HeLa cells (ATCC) were
grown in McCoy’s 5a Modified Medium (Corning
Cellgro) and DMEM, respectively. Cells were incubated
at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Osteogenic differentiation
Cells were incubated in the presence of the
osteogenic supplements 10-7M dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich), 10-2M β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and
5x10-5M ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) (differentiation
media) during 28 days (for human MSC differentiation
into osteoblasts) or 14 days (for MC3T3 differentiation
into osteoblasts). Media was changed every 3 days. ALP
staining (a key osteogenic marker) was performed at day
14 (human MSC) and day 7 (MC3T3) of differentiation;
Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) staining to confirm the
presence of extracellular calcium deposits (a hallmark of
mineralization) was performed at day 28 (human MSC)
and day 14 (MC3T3) of differentiation (Supplementary
Methods).
Weak and strong ALP intensities were counted after
thresholding colour images on the total area of each well
and quantified as previously described by us (light ALP:
red > 77 and 1.2 x green < red < 1.5 x green; strong ALP:
red > 77 and red > 1.5 x green) [44].

Microarrays
MiRNA expression profiling data was generated
by MicroRNA Array Services from Exiqon. Briefly,
the samples were labeled using the miRCURY LNA™
microRNA Hi-Power Labeling Kit, Hy3™/Hy5™ and
hybridized on the miRCURY LNA™ microRNA Array
(7th Gen). Following normalization of the quantified
signals (corrected background) using the global Lowess
regression algorithm, an unsupervised as well as
supervised data analysis was performed.

Electroporations and transfections
Human primary MSC (Lonza) (0.5x106) were mixed
with Pre-miR miRNA Precursors miR-195, Pre-miR
miRNA Precursors miR-497 or Pre-miR miRNA Precursor
Negative Control (Scrambled - SCR) (Life Technologies)
in an electroporation cuvette and electroporated using
OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) in a Gene
Pulser Xcell Electroporation Systems (Bio-Rad) with the
following conditions: voltage - 250 V, capacitance - 950
µF, resistance - 200 Ω [46].
For miR-195 antagonist experiments, 100nM antimiR-195 (mirVana® miRNA inhibitor, ThermoFisher
Scientific) or SCR Negative Control (Anti-miR Negative
Control #1, ThermoFisher Scientific) were used to
transfect MSC using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent

RNA isolation
RNA from human primary cells and cell lines was
isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity was
assessed with NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was assessed
by gel electrophoresis of total RNA ran in 1% agarose gel.

Chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) angiogenesis assay

(Invitrogen), according to manufacturer´s instructions.
MC3T3 cells (3x106) plated in a 10-cm culture dish
were transfected with 50 nM Pre-miR miRNA Precursors
miR-143, Pre-miR miRNA Precursors miR-195, PremiR miRNA Precursors miR-497 or Pre-miR miRNA
Precursor Negative Control (Scrambled - SCR) (Life
Technologies) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection
reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Media without
antibiotics was used.
Cells were collected after 12 hours and plated for the
different assays. All Electroporations/Transfections were
confirmed by RT-qPCR.

The chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) model was used to evaluate angiogenic effect
of miR-195, miR-497 and SCR electroporated MSC
conditioned media. The media was collected 72h after cell
electroporation and 2x concentrated in Savant SpeedVac
Concentrator under vacuum (Thermo Scientific).
Fertilized chick (Gallus gallus) eggs obtained from
commercial sources were incubated horizontally at 37.8°C
in a humidified atmosphere and referred to embryonic
day (E). On E3 a square window was opened in the shell
after removal of 2-2.5ml of albumen to allow detachment
of the developing CAM. The window was sealed with
a transparent adhesive tape and the eggs returned to the
incubator. Conditioned medium from miR-195, miR497 or SCR expressing MSC, were placed on top of E10
growing CAM into a 3mm silicone ring under sterile
conditions. The eggs were re-sealed and returned to the
incubator for an additional 72h. After removing the ring,
the CAM was excised from the embryos and photographed
ex ovo under a stereoscope at 20x magnification (Olympus,
SZX16 coupled with a DP71 camera). The number of
new vessels (less than 15µm diameter) growing radially
towards the ring area was counted in a blind fashion
manner by two independent observers. The first CAM
assay experiment was performed using 3 different batches
of eggs and using condition media from 2 independent
experiments. The second CAM assay independent
experiment was performed using a new batch of eggs and
20 pg or 50 ng of human recombinant VEGF (VEGF-165,
PeproTech) were added to the miR-195-MSC condition
media and placed on CAM together with the controls.
GraphPad statistical program was used for data
analysis. A student t test (for samples with unequal
variance) was used to calculate significance. Values of P <
0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Resazurin reduction assay
To determine the effect of miRNAs on proliferation,
MSC (Passage 7) electroporated with Pre-miR miRNA
Precursors miR-195, Pre-miR miRNA Precursors miR497 or Pre-miR miRNA Precursor Negative Control
(Scrambled - SCR) were plated in 96-well plates in
sextuplicates. Cells were incubated with resazurin (Sigma
Aldrich) for 2 h at 37ºC protected from light to allow
cells to convert resazurin to resorufin. Fluorescence was
measured (530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission) in
a Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek).
Two independent experiments were performed. Student t
test was used to calculate significance. Values of P < 0.05
were considered to be statistically significant.

Immunostaining
miR-195, miR-497 or SCR-electroporated MSC,
and anti-miR-195 or SCR negative control-transfected
MSC, were grown on top of cover-slips. Cells were fixed
with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% triton X-100
and blocked with 5% BSA. Cells were incubated for 2
h with primary anti-Ki-67 (Thermo Scientific) antibody
and for 45 min with secondary anti-rabbit CY3 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) antibody. Vectshield with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories) was used as mounting media. Slides were
observed using Leica TCS SP2 (Inverted microscope
Leica DMIRE2 and LCS 2.61 software). Details on
quantification of total number of cells and Ki-67+ cells
are provided in Supplementary Methods.
GraphPad Prism statistical program was used for the
construction of a column bar graphic. One-way ANOVA
(and non-parametric) was used to calculate significance.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
