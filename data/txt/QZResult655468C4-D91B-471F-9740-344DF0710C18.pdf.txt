mechanism of intrinsic multi-drug resistance based on the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation.

mitochondrial respiration blocked the emergence of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and
sensitized melanoma cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a twotiered approach combining anti-cancer agents that eliminate rapidly proliferating melanoma cells
with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling subpopulation.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Malignant melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor of neuroectodermal origin that can be cured
if excised at an early stage; however, once disseminated to distant organs, the median
survival of patients drops below 9 months. All major cancer therapies have failed to
persistently increase melanoma patients survival rates. This failure is attributed to different
resistance mechanisms including increased DNA repair, overexpression of anti-apoptotic
proteins such as BCL-2, and drug efflux pumps such as ABCB5 (Chen et al., 2009). Despite
encouraging response rates seen with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAFV600E–
positive individuals, relapses occur after a median duration of ~5 months following initial
tumor shrinkage (Sosman et al., 2012). Several groups have identified various mechanisms
of acquired therapy resistance in BRAF-targeted melanomas. Surviving melanomas reactivate pivotal networks such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways, e.g. through activation of
PDGFR- , CRAF, and IGFR1 (Nazarian et al., 2010; Villanueva et al. 2010), dimerization
of aberrantly spliced BRAF isoforms (Poulikakos et al., 2011) or by secondary genetic
events such as genomic amplification of COT, NRAS mutations, or the MEK1C121S
mutation (Johannessen et al., 2010; Wagle et al., 2011). However, even among functionally
and genetically heterogeneous tumors, common and intrinsic survival mechanisms exist.
Cytotoxic agents including conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation most
effectively eliminate rapidly dividing cells (Blagosklonny, 2005). This concept is gaining
prominence in the field of cancer research with several studies reporting the enrichment of
quiescent cancer stem cells after chemotherapy. For example, slow-cycling glioblastoma
cells survive temozolomide treatment (Chen et al., 2012). Accordingly, if cell
subpopulations can act as major drivers for tumor maintenance and mediate universal
therapeutic resistance, approaches that target this phenotype could increase the efficacy of
treatment regimens and reduce the risk of melanoma relapses.

We have recently demonstrated that even within highly proliferative melanomas, there is a
slow-cycling cell subpopulation that is identifiable by the expression of the histone 3 K4
demethylase JARID1B (Roesch et al., 2005; Roesch et al., 2010). JARID1B (KDM5B/
PLU-1/RBP2-H1) is a member of the highly conserved family of jumonji/ARID1 H3K4
demethylases which are involved in tissue development, cancer, and stem cell biology
(Christensen et al., 2007; Dey et al., 2008; Yamane et al., 2007). The JARID1Bhigh slowcycling subpopulation is required for the continuous tumor growth of melanoma; however, it
does not follow a unidirectional cancer stem cell hierarchy. The JARID1Bhigh phenotype is
temporarily distinct, dynamic, and can be acquired depending on the microenvironmental
context (Roesch et al., 2010). In this respect, another study indicates that other types of
cancers, such as breast or lung cancer, also harbor populations of quiescent cells that are
drug resistant, and whose phenotypes can switch dynamically (Sharma et al., 2010).
Interestingly, in the latter study slow-cycling cells were characterized by the expression of
the chromatin-remodeling factor JARID1A, a homologue of JARID1B.
Considering JARID1B’s role in continuous tumor maintenance (Roesch et al., 2010), we
asked, (1) whether the subpopulation of JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling melanoma cells displays
lower drug susceptibility compared to the bulk of tumor cells, and (2) whether this resistant
phenotype can be pharmacologically eradicated.

Cytotoxic treatment of melanoma cells results in the enrichment of a surviving
JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling subpopulation
To assess whether slow-cycling melanoma cells show differences in the therapeutic response
compared to the rapidly proliferating bulk, we treated melanoma cultures with various anticancer drugs. To discriminate between slowly and rapidly cycling subpopulations, we used a
JARID1B-promoter-EGFP-reporter construct as previously described (Roesch et al., 2010).
This fluorescence-based model allows both the detection of slow-cycling melanoma cells
based on their expression of JARID1B and monitoring of the dynamic nature of the
JARID1B phenotype while cells are alive and interacting with their microenvironment. Prior
in vitro and in vivo expression studies confirmed the correlation between the endogenous
expression of JARID1B and the JARID1B-promoter-induced expression of EGFP
(abbreviated J/EGFP) using an analytical threshold set to the maximum 5% of the
fluorescence signal (Figure S1A and Roesch et al., 2010). Cells with an EGFP signal above
this threshold show the highest endogenous JARID1B levels and, thus, can be reliably
selected and analyzed. Two genetically different melanoma cell lines, WM3734 and
1205Lu, were stably transduced with this reporter construct and named
WM3734JARID1Bprom-EGFP and 1205LuJARID1Bprom-EGFP.

When the cell lines were treated with cisplatin at a highly toxic concentration (20 µM) for
24, 48, and 72 hr, a gradual separation of the total population emerged into live, 7AAD− and
dead, 7AAD+ subpopulations (Figure 1A). With increasing incubation time, 7AAD− cells
were incrementally enriched for J/EGFPhigh cells whereas 7AAD+ cells were relatively J/
EGFPlow. Control cells stably expressing a CMV-promoter-EGFP-reporter construct failed
to show such a separation/enrichment pattern. While the total number of cells was constantly
decreasing with rising cisplatin doses, the relative number of J/EGFPhigh cells was
significantly increasing in the drug resistant population (Figure 1B, Figure S1B). For
example, up to 30.2% J/EGFPhigh cells were seen following 20 µM of cisplatin addition,
compared to the 5% seen in vehicle controls. Immunoblotting confirmed a ~3-fold
enrichment for endogenous JARID1B protein after densitometric normalization to GAPDH
(Figure 1C). Vemurafenib also failed to eradicate all melanoma cells and enriched for J/
EGFPhigh cells; however, to a lesser extent than seen for cisplatin (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
even when high concentrations of vemurafenib were applied, a distinct subpopulation of
cells remained alive (7AAD−) and displayed a ~3-fold higher fluorescence intensity for J/
EGFP (GMean=25.55) than the population of vemurafenib-sensitive (7AAD+) cells
(GMean=8.54, Figure 1D). The surviving melanoma cells did not change in their mutational
status of BRAF as confirmed by DNA sequencing before and after treatment (not shown). In
a previous publication, we have excluded the acquisition of secondary mutations for a large
panel of diverse melanoma cell lines rendered resistant to BRAF inhibitors. We have tested
451Lu, Mel1617, WM983B, WM902B, SKMel28 (parental and resistant pairs, several
passages) for mutations in BRAF, NRAS, TP53, PTEN, KIT, MEK1, MEK2, AKT1,
CDKN2A, and CDK4 (Villanueva et al., 2010).
Interestingly, similar results were observed for other anti-cancer drugs such as bortezomib
and temozolomide (Figure 2A). We also note that a number of cells with relatively low J/
EGFP expression can survive various drug treatments indicating other potential operating
mechanisms of phenotypic resistance. In contrast to its proposed effect on cancer stem cells
(Gupta et al., 2009), the potassium ionophore salinomycin also showed a strong enrichment
of J/EGFPhigh cells. To rule out an unspecific bias in our model, we tested vitamin D3 as a
compound with a different anti-cancer mechanism (pro-differentiation; Figure 2B). Here, no
significant change in J/EGFPhigh cells was seen. Next, we tested compounds that are
expected to diminish the slow-cycling phenotype such as the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A

(Sharma et al., 2010) or the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A (Sp1 binding sites within the
JARID1B promoter are indicative of a possible regulatory potential); however, both
compounds failed to reduce the J/EGFPhigh subpopulation (Figure 2B). Similarly,
leflunomide which was suggested to interfere with developmental processes in melanocytes
and melanoma growth (White et al., 2011), did not reduce the J/EGFPhigh subpopulation in
our model (Figure S2).
The in vivo relevance of our observations was confirmed in WM3734 cells xenografted to
NSG mice and treated with vemurafenib (Figure 3A). While tumors decreased in size due to
treatment, the number and staining intensity of resistant JARID1Bhigh cells significantly
increased. Importantly, a clear increase in JARID1B expressing cells could be observed in 3
out of 4 matched pairs of patients’ melanomas that relapsed under vemurafenib (Figure 3B).
Together, these data indicate a universal resistance of the slow-cycling JARID1Bhigh
melanoma subpopulation against various anti-cancer agents.
Knockdown of JARID1B leads to increased in vivo sensitivity to anti-melanoma treatment

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous studies suggested that the abrogation of the slow-cycling phenotype by JARID1Bspecific knockdown leads in vitro and in vivo to increased cell proliferation followed by
melanoma exhaustion (Roesch et al., 2010). To quantify the shifts in cell cycle progression
depending on the presence or absence of JARID1B, we performed cell cycle experiments in
WM35 melanoma cells stably knocked down for JARID1B (Figure 3C and S3). WM35
were chosen because changes in cell cycle of this low tumorigenic cell line could be better
assessed compared to lines with high doubling rate. Influences of cell densities and growth
factors were considered. Cells were seeded at different densities and serum-starved at 0%
FCS for 4 days to synchronize the cell cycles. Under these conditions, knockdown of
JARID1B led to an increase in S phase cells when compared to the control. Following
stimulation with 2%, 5%, and 10% FCS over 4, 8, 16, and 24 hr, JARID1B knockdown cells
shifted to G2/M. The most consistent changes in the cell cycle were seen after 8 hr of 10%
FCS stimulation. Across five independently performed experiments, we saw an average
decrease in G1 phase cells in JARID1B knocked down cells by ~20% [ranging from ~5% to
40% (the latter experiment is depicted in Figure 3C)], while S phase cells increased by ~6%
(~2% to 12%), and G2/M phase cells by ~14% (~1% to 31%). As predicted by previous
studies showing JARID1B/pRB-dependent cell cycle control (Roesch et al., 2006),
JARID1B knockdown was accompanied by an increase in pRB phosphorylation at the
JARID1B-specific phosphorylation site Ser795 (Figure 3C). Consequently, we asked if the
inhibition of JARID1B could affect the therapeutic responsiveness of melanoma cells to
anti-cancer drugs while releasing them from their slow-cycling phenotype. Indeed, stable
knockdown of JARID1B in WM3734 melanoma cells xenografted to NSG mice led to
increased cell proliferation accompanied by a significant sensitization to different treatments
(Figure 3D). JARID1B knockdown plus bortezomib showed an additive effect, improving
the moderate anti-melanoma effect of bortezomib to an almost complete stasis of tumor
growth. When we combined JARID1B knockdown with vemurafenib, which by itself
dramatically prevents melanoma growth, we still observed a decrease in the average tumor
volume below that of the treatment-starting volume. Because of the biological variability of
tumor sizes this effect was not significant in the MANOVA, but an analysis of the change in
the logarithm of volume per unit time by t-test had significantly different rates. In sum, these
results support the hypothesis that targeting the slow-cycling cell phenotype can sensitize
melanoma to anti-cancer approaches including chemotherapeutics and molecular targeted
drugs.

Dynamics of the therapy-resistant JARID1Bhigh phenotype

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

According to our previous observations, the progeny of both J/EGFPhigh and J/EGFPlow
cells can dynamically interconvert into the opposing phenotype, indicating a flexible system
that is dependent on the microenvironmental context (Roesch et al., 2010). Thus, we asked
(1) if the newly developing progenies of initially sorted J/EGFPhigh or J/EGFPlow cells show
a differential drug response and (2) if the observed enrichment of J/EGFPhigh cells after anticancer treatment results from selection of J/EGFPhigh cells or induction of J/EGFPhigh
expression. In regular culture, spontaneous phenotype interconversion usually becomes
visible within a few days after FACS sorting of the two populations. For example, 69.9% of
FACS-sorted J/EGFPhigh cells turned negative 72 hr after separation (Figure 4Ac, upper left
plus lower left quadrant), while in total 3.5% of the progeny of sorted J/EGFPlow cells
became J/EGFPhigh (Figure 4Ae). When sorted cells were treated with 20 µM cisplatin for
72 hr, we saw no substantial enrichment for J/EGFPhigh cells in the progeny of initially J/
EGFPhigh cells indicating that no additional JARID1B-expression cells were induced
(summarized upper and lower right quadrants, Figure 4Ac vs. 4Ad). Interestingly, most
newly developed J/EGFPlow cells became 7AAD+ under cisplatin treatment (Figure 4Ac vs.
d, upper and lower left quadrants). The apparent preference for JARID1B induction in the
progeny of J/EGFPlow cells (Figure 4Ae vs. f) was counteracted by an increased rate of
cisplatin-induced cell death in cells derived from the J/EGFPlow population. Manual counts
revealed a significantly lower number of surviving cells in the progeny of sorted J/EGFPlow
cells compared to the progeny of J/EGFPhigh cells [p<0.05 for 5 µM and 10 µM cisplatin
(data not shown)]. Together with the results from consecutive measurements of JARID1B
mRNA under cisplatin treatment that did not show transcriptional upregulation (Figure 4A),
we concluded that the major mechanism for the enrichment of J/EGFPhigh cells following
therapy is a selection of pre-existent JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling cells. However, to a lesser
extent JARID1B induction may also occur, e.g. shifting cells with intermediate JARID1B
expression to higher levels.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When cells were long-term challenged with cisplatin, the J/EGFPhigh subpopulation
remained constantly elevated over several weeks in a dose-dependent manner. The cisplatininduced elevation of J/EGFPhigh cells was fully reversible following drug withdrawal
(Figure 4B). In line with the concept of dynamic phenotype switching (Roesch et al., 2010),
drug-resistant cells that are enriched for JARID1B can regain the original cell distribution
and J/EGFP-ratios after drug removal. Moreover, cisplatin-surviving JARID1B-enriched
cells gave rise to fewer but significantly larger, i.e. rapidly growing, 3D colonies in soft agar
compared to untreated cells (Figure 4C). This observation is reminiscent of earlier
clonogenicity and single cell dilution assays showing that untreated FACS-isolated J/
EGFPhigh cells give rise to a rapidly-proliferating progeny with elevated repopulation
capacity when compared to JARID1Blow cells (Roesch et al., 2010).
Bioenergetic metabolism plays an important role in the survival of slow-cycling melanoma
cells
We next designed experiments to unravel druggable targets that are specifically activated in
slow-cycling melanoma cells. Since global gene expression screening with cDNA
microarrays did not provide significant hit candidates in FACS-sorted J/EGFPhigh vs. J/
EGFPlow or JARID1B knockdown vs. control cells (not shown), we performed quantitative
proteome profiling. Following our established protocols for isolation of slow-cycling
melanoma cells (Roesch et al., 2010), we co-stained WM3734JARID1Bprom-EGFP cells with
the PKH26 dye, then FACS-isolated the label-retaining and J/EGFPhigh subpopulation vs.
non-label-retaining J/EGFPlow cells after a period of 4 weeks of cell divisions. Prior to
sorting, the cells were grown as melanospheres to attain a more stringent J/EGFP phenotype
as previously reported (Roesch et al., 2010). Tryptic digests of the cell lysates were analyzed

by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Label-free computational
quantitation identified 423 proteins with significant expression changes between labelretaining J/EGFPhigh cells and non-label-retaining J/EGFPlow cells with a p-value <0.001.
Unexpectedly, neither common cancer target nor drug-resistance-related protein could be
detected by this approach. Instead, we found a differential regulation of a number of
mitochondrial proteins with particular functions in bioenergetic metabolism (Table S1).
Many of the upregulated proteins play a major role in cell respiratory electron transport
(oxidative phosphorylation, OXPHOS) such as NADH dehydrogenase (complex I of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain), ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase (complex III),
cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and ATP-synthase. In contrast, glycolytic hexokinase I
and II were downregulated. Immunoblotting of lysates from J/EGFP-sorted cells confirmed
upregulation of ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase, ubiquinol-cyctochrome C reductasebinding protein, and cytochrome c oxidase in J/EGFPhigh cells (Figure 5A). WM3734 cells
transiently overexpressing JARID1B had a higher mitochondrial energy production
compared to the mock control (Figure 5B). Accordingly, JARID1B-overexpressing
WM3734 cells consumed ~ 50% more oxygen than control cells (Figure 5C). Treatment
with different concentrations of oligomycin and rotenone severely reduced the oxygen
consumption by up to 94%, indicating a major role for mitochondria in this process (not
shown). Because high mitochondrial electron transfer activity can lead to increase in
superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, we analyzed the H2O2 level. 60–72
hours after transfection, JARID1B-overexpressing cells generated 76% more H2O2 than
control cells (Figure 5D). The H2O2 increase was completely abolished by treatment with
oligomycin or rotenone. These results suggest that redox signaling may play an important
role for JARID1Bhigh cells. Furthermore, high oxygen consumption can ultimately lead to
hypoxic conditions, which is known to favor the JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling phenotype (Xia
et al., 2009; Roesch et al., 2010).
Targeting the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibits the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation and
reveals long-term effects against melanoma cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been reported to exert tumor
suppressive effects in different types of cancers including neuroectodermal glioblastoma
cells (Hao et al., 2010). Since enzymes of almost all respiratory chain complexes were found
differentially regulated in slow-cycling J/EGFPhigh cells (Table S1), we explored
representative inhibitory tool compounds such as (i) the ATP-synthase inhibitors oligomycin
and Bz-423, (ii) the NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) inhibitors rotenone and phenformin,
and (iii) antimycin A which inhibits the ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase in a series of
preliminary cytotoxicity assays (not shown). Here, ATP-synthase and complex I inhibitors
revealed the most prominent results; thus, these were selected for subsequent studies. High
concentrations of oligomycin were reported to exert unspecific effects in eukaryotes due to
the uncoupling of the respiratory chain (Charton et al., 2004). Therefore, MTT assays were
used to estimate the minimal concentration of oligomycin that could cause mitochondrial
uncoupling in our cell lines since reduction of the tetrazolium compound MTT is dependent
on intact mitochondrial electron transport (Grazette et al., 2004). We observed an abrupt
decrease in MTT reduction above an oligomycin concentration of 2.5–5 µg/ml independent
of the incubation time and the genetic background of all cell lines tested (Figure 6A,
depicted are WM3734 as an example). These results are in line with oligomycin
concentrations that were reported by others to specifically block oxidative phosphorylation
(Hao et al., 2010). Thus, we considered oligomycin concentrations below 2.5 µg/ml to work
through the specific inhibition of the ATP-synthase and not through mitochondrial
uncoupling.

We next asserted that low-dose oligomycin still leads to functional and significantly
measurable effects such as a decrease in ATP production or increase in lactate secretion in
WM3734 cells (Figure 6B), and subsequently confirmed this for a panel of genetically
different melanoma lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Figure 6C). The detected
changes in ATP and lactate were comparable to those measured by others for a number of
different cell types (Hao et al., 2010). Interestingly, ATP-synthase inhibition was
accompanied by a complete loss of endogenously expressed JARID1B protein after 72 hr of
oligomycin treatment (Figure 6D). Also, the enrichment of JARID1Bhigh cells usually seen
after hypoxic treatment was inhibited by low-dose oligomycin.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Due to the evolutionary link between non-proliferative and OXPHOS-dependent cell
phenotypes (Berridge et al., 2010; Jose et al., 2011; Vander Heiden et al., 2009), we next
asked if inhibition of mitochondrial ATP-production also influences the cell cycle of
melanoma cells. In fact, even very low-doses of oligomycin (0.01 µg/ml) caused a
measurable decrease in the percentage of cells in G1/0 phase and an increase in the
percentage of cells in S- and G2/M-phase compared to vehicle controls. To optimize the
readout, cells were serum-starved for 4 days and subsequently stimulated with FCS for 8 and
16 hr (Figure 6E). After 24 hr, cell cycle phases were again equal in oligomycin and vehicle
control-treated cell groups (not shown). Despite the increase in proliferative cell cycle
phases, we found a relative decrease in overall cell numbers after oligomycin treatment
compared to controls (Figure 6F). A likely explanation for this paradox is that
simultaneously to (or after) the acceleration of the cell cycle, a considerable portion of the
cells is undergoing cell death as indicated by independently performed 7AAD staining and
subsequent flow cytometric analysis (e.g. ~20% dead cells after 72 hr of 0.1 µg/ml
oligomycin, Figure S4A). Short-term analysis of oligomycin’s effect on total cell numbers
showed that the cell population slightly expands at low doses (Figure 6F, left panel),
whereas high doses starting from 5 µg/ml caused persisting or decreasing cell numbers,
possibly due to highly toxic mitochondrial uncoupling. The full effect of the anti-tumor
potential of low-dose oligomycin became visible in long-term colony formation assays.
Here, a significant reduction in colony growth was seen after 3 weeks of treatment (Figure
6F, right panel), which is reminiscent of the results previously reported for JARID1B
knockdown (Roesch et al., 2010). Short-term treatment of WM3734 cells with the ATPsynthase inhibitor Bz-423 and the complex I inhibitors rotenone and phenformin confirmed
these findings (Figure S4B, S4C, and S4D). In conclusion, this suggests that
pharmacological targeting of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can inhibit the
JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling subpopulation and reveal long-term suppressive effects in
melanoma cells.

Inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain overcomes intrinsic multi-drug resistance
of melanoma
We asked if inhibition of the mitochondrial respiration could counteract the intrinsic multidrug resistance mediated by slow-cycling melanoma cells. Flow-cytometric quantitation of
J/EGFP levels in WM3734 cells (Figure 7A) and 1205LU cells (Figure S5A) revealed a
significant blockade of the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation when cells were treated with the
combination of cisplatin plus oligomycin. Similar results were seen for Bz-423, which also
acts as an ATP-synthase inhibitor (Figure S5B). Even treatment with extremely low doses of
oligomycin (0.001 µg/ml,Figure S5C) still blocked the enrichment of J/EGFPhigh cells. At
0.001 µg/ml, single agent oligomycin did not induce substantial cell death as measured by
7AAD flow cytometry in WM3734 cells (Figure S4A); however, when combined with
cisplatin the overall number of dead cells strongly increased (Figure S5C). Immunoblots
revealed a complete loss of endogenous JARID1B under oligomycin co-treatment
overcoming the cisplatin-induced enrichment of JARID1B protein after 24, 48, and 72 hr

(Figure 7A). Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that the combination with oligomycin sensitizes
melanoma cells to cisplatin treatment, but depending on the cell line used the contribution of
single agent oligomycin to cell killing can vary (Figure 7B). MeWo cells, the melanoma cell
line with the lowest oligomycin response in lactate secretion (Figure 6C), were not
sensitized to cisplatin indicating that the combination with oligomycin is not universally
cytotoxic but instead, responses match our mitochondrial activity-based hypothesis. The
tumor suppressive potential of combinatorial ATP-synthase inhibition was further
demonstrated in 3D collagen-embedded spheroids of 1205Lu cells, a model which more
readily mimics the melanoma microenvironment. The combination of oligomycin plus
vemurafenib more potently inhibited cell invasion into collagen than each drug alone
(Figure 7C, p<0.0003). Notably, treatment of WM3734 cells with a single pulse of low-dose
oligomycin plus cisplatin over 72 hr substantially reduced long-term growth in soft agar and
the number of 3D-colonies remained at almost undetectable levels even after 5 weeks of
culture in drug-free medium (Figure 7D). This effect reached statistical significance with
p<0.02 when large colonies above a diameter of 10 µm were counted. Consistent with the
observation that significantly larger colonies grew from cisplatin pre-treated cells (that were
enriched for the J/EGFPhigh subpopulation, Figure 4C), these results indicate that (i) adding
mitochondrial inhibitors to common anti-cancer treatment significantly diminishes the
number of cells with high repopulation and invasion potential and (ii) that even a relatively
short-term treatment can yield a sustained anti-tumor effect.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial inhibition as a combinatorial strategy against cancer drug-induced enrichment
of slow-cycling JARID1Bhigh melanoma cells was further confirmed for the complex I
inhibitors rotenone and phenformin. Phenformin is used in the clinics as an anti-diabetic
drug. Both compounds potently blocked the emergence of JARID1Bhigh cells during antimelanoma treatment (Figure 8A, Figure S6A–Figure S6D). Immunoblots and
immunohistochemistry of phenformin-treated cells confirmed that complex I inhibition
affects the endogenous JARID1B phenotype in vitro and in vivo (Figure S6C and S6D).
Similar to the combinations of bortezomib or vemurafenib with JARID1B gene knockdown
shown in Figure 3D, the mitochondrial inhibition by phenformin improved the tumor
suppressive potential of vemurafenib in xenotransplanted melanomas in vivo (Figure 8B and
Figure S6D). Statistical overall significance was shown by MANOVA (p=0.0263).
Significant differences between the combination and single treatments were seen after
adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (combination vs. vemurafenib was p=0.022, vs.
phenformin p=0.010, and vs. control p=0.010). Altogether, these findings suggest that multiresistant, slow-cycling melanoma cells are susceptible to the inhibition of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain and that the oxidative energy metabolism could be a prime target to
overcome intrinsic drug resistance in melanoma.

Discussion
Despite recent discoveries in the area of therapy resistance in melanoma, we do not fully
know how therapeutic escape arises and if it is the result of an evolutionary process under
treatment or from the selection of pre-existing resistant subpopulations or a combination of
both. Likely, even among functionally and genetically heterogeneous tumors, common
mechanisms may exist that allow cells to survive in harsh conditions in general. Based on
our experience with vemurafenib-resistant clones in vitro, we observed that functionally
acquired resistance in cell lines that are initially vemurafenib-sensitive takes time to
develop, but eventually leads to re-activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways (Villanueva
et al., 2010). Intrinsic resistance conferred by the slow-cycling cell phenotype could
represent an additional and universal protection mechanism that helps cells survive the very
first contact with various cytotoxic agents and provides cells with added survival time to
establish longer-lasting secondary resistance mechanisms. A major challenge for successful

therapy is that these slow-cycling cells can be present at any stage of the disease and that
this phenotype can be dynamically acquired by other melanoma cells depending on the
microenvironmental context, thus representing a ‘moving target’ (Roesch et al., 2005;
Roesch et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our findings indicate that the slow-cycling phenotype reflects a metabolic state that is
characterized by high expression of mitochondrial bioenergetic enzymes relative to the
rapidly proliferating tumor bulk population. Otto Warburg predicted that cancer cells
generally rely on an increase in glucose uptake, the enhancement of glycolysis and lactate
production along with the absence of oxidative respiration, despite the presence of sufficient
oxygen concentrations (Warburg et al., 1924). He erroneously suggested defective
mitochondria as a possible cause. However, it is becoming clear now that mitochondria in
cancer cells are mostly intact and may play an important role in tumor growth (Caro et al.,
2012; Weinberg et al., 2010). The cells’ decision to employ glycolysis or oxidative
phosphorylation for their energy supply depends on multiple factors, including the cancer
type and stage, the sequence of oncogenes activated which can directly influence
mitochondrial metabolism, the current microenvironmental context, and also the rate of cell
proliferation (Berridge et al., 2010; Jose et al., 2011; Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Our
results support the general hypothesis that slow-cycling cells rely more on oxidative
phosphorylation, whereas rapidly growing cells are characterized by high glycolysis
(Berridge et al., 2010; Jose et al., 2011; Vander Heiden et al., 2009). As previously shown
by others, the blockage of glycolysis by bromopyruvate treatment is only efficient on rapidly
growing cells and barely useful to decrease the growth rate of tumor cells with slow
proliferation (Jose et al., 2011). This observation together with ours indicates that cell
cycling and energy metabolism represent interwoven biologic processes that holistically
contribute to the phenotype of tumor cell subpopulations. With regard to intrinsic drug
susceptibility, we found that the JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling phenotype is not responding to
exogenous cell cycle influences such as serum starvation (data not shown). Since depletion
of JARID1B does affect cell cycle phases, we would consider JARID1B expression to be a
“driver” of the slow cycling phenotype rather than a “passenger”. Treatment with the multiCDK inhibitor dinaciclib resulted in massive cell death rather than in proliferation arrest
and, thus, passively selected for JARID1Bhigh cells as seen before for other anti-cancer
agents (data not shown). We further suggest that consideration of single biologic features,
such as cell cycling, without the metabolic contribution may not be sufficient to predict
therapeutic response. For example, MeWo cells, which are known to have a high ability to
metabolize glutamine in the (reversed) TCA cycle as an alternative energy source (Scott et
al., 2011), responded least to cytotoxic killing and mitochondrial inhibition, although having
a rather high proliferation rate (and low endogenous JARID1B expression, data not shown).

We cannot exclude the possibility that our initial proteome profiling strategy may have
missed additional important factors contributing to the biology of slow-cycling cells.
Therefore, we analyzed common molecular players of melanoma tumorigenesis by
immunoblotting of sorted J/EGFPhigh vs. J/EGFPlow cells. We found no difference in
MAPK activation (measured by pMEK and pERK levels) nor in the expression of the
apoptosis markers BCL-2, MCL-1, and BIM or the cell cycle regulators CDK2, CDK4, and
CDK9 (not shown). Interestingly, we found an increase in pAKT in J/EGFPhigh cells that
correlates well with our previous finding that re-activation of PI3K signaling can overcome
vemurafenib’s cytotoxicity in melanoma cells (Villanueva et al., 2010). The relevance of
this finding with regard to therapeutic strategies comprising combinatorial inhibition of
PI3K in slow-cycling cells will be the subject of future studies. Considering the
heterogeneity of melanoma, we are currently delineating additional molecular mechanisms
underlying resistance of the JARID1Bhigh slow-cycling phenotype. However, non-

JARID1B-related phenotypic resistance is likely to occur and all potential resistance
mechanisms could contribute to melanoma recurrence.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our data confirm that slow-cycling melanoma cells of different genetic backgrounds are
intrinsically resistant to various anti-cancer drugs and are characterized by the presence of
several key enzymes of oxidative energy metabolism. Depletion of the JARID1Bhigh slowcycling phenotype either by gene knockdown or by targeting of its bioenergetic metabolism
sensitizes melanoma for a more pronounced and long-lasting therapeutic effect. Selective
targeting of the slow-cycling subpopulation in combination with conventional tumor
“debulking” strategies could help to eliminate a dramatically higher percentage of melanoma
cells and significantly prolong the therapeutic response in patients with malignant
melanoma.

Experimental Procedures
Melanoma cell lines, tissue, and vector constructs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Establishment and studying of non-commercial melanoma cell lines from human tumor
samples was approved by the Internal Review Boards of the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine and The Wistar Institute. Immunohistochemical staining of human
melanoma samples was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Frankfurt
and the Saarland University. Informed consents were obtained from all participating
subjects. For details on cell culture techniques, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
The consistency of cellular genotypes was confirmed by DNA fingerprinting at the
Department of Human Genetics of The Saarland University Hospital. The lentiviral vector
constructs for stable knockdown of JARID1B were purchased from Sigma. Details on
lentiviral pLU-JARID1Bprom-EGFP-Blast, pLU-CMVprom-EGFP-Blast, and transient
transfection with pBIND-RBP2H1(JARID1B) were previously described (Roesch et al.,
2010; Roesch et al., 2008).
Detection of JARID1B and flow cytometry of J/EGFP signals

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For immunoblotting and immunostaining rabbit polyclonal anti-JARID1B antibodies
(Novus 22260002 and NB100-97821) were used following established protocols (Roesch et
al., 2010). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus instrument
(Applied Biosystems) using self-designed primers or primers from the Harvard primer bank
as described earlier (Roesch et al., 2010). Flow cytometric detection of JARID1B promoterdriven EGFP signals was performed using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) as described in
the supplements. Dead cells were excluded by staining for 7AAD. Fluorescence activated
cell sorting was done on a Cytomation MoFlo (DakoCytomation) or a FACSAriaIII (BD
Biosciences) instrument.
Cell proliferation and three-dimensional growth/invasion/survival assays
Cell proliferation was quantified by MTT and crystal violet assays according to standard
protocols. Anchorage-independent colony formation was measured in 0.35% soft agar
assays and quantified manually or digitally as described before using Image Pro Plus 7.0
(Roesch et al., 2010). Collagen-embedded three-dimensional melanoma spheroids were
prepared and treated with inhibitors at the designated concentrations for 72 hours as
previously described (Smalley et al., 2006). Following treatment, spheroids were imaged
using a Nikon-300 inverted fluorescence microscope. To quantitate invasion into the matrix,
borders were established around the invasive edge based on an ImageJ-defined cell density
parameter and the same parameters were applied to all images.

Measurement of ATP and lactate

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total cellular ATP was measured using the ATP-based CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each well on a 96-well plate was seeded with
2000 cells which were incubated with compounds at designated concentrations over varying
time points (1, 2, 4, 24 hr). Luminescence was measured on a Tecan M200 Infinite plate
reader. Mitochondrial ATP levels were determined using the mitochondrial ATP sensor
protein ATEAM as reported (Imamura et al., 2009) and described in the supplements. For
lactate measurement, 105 cells were plated per well on a 6-well plate and treated with
compounds over 6, 24, or 72 hr. Cell culture supernatant (500 µl) was collected and
centrifuged to remove any cellular debris. Subsequently, an aliquot of 100 µl was analyzed
using Roche’s automated Modular Analytics system.
In vivo melanoma models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and national
guidelines and regulations. The protocols have been approved by the Wistar IACUC or the
Saarland Veterinary Administration. NOD/LtSscidIL2R null (NSG) and SCID beige mice
were used for xenotransplantation. WM3734 or SKMel28 human melanoma cells were
subcutaneously injected at a Matrigel®/culture medium ratio of 1:1. Mice were treated with
(i) bortezomib every other day (20 µg per intraperitoneal injection) or (ii) with vemurafenib
every 12 hr (100 mg/kg per oral gavage) or (iii), for combination studies, with vemurafenib
(15 mg/kg) plus phenformin [150 mg/kg (Appleyard et al., 2012)] every 12 hr. Buffered
saline or 0.1% Tween 80/0.5% methylcellulose served as vehicle controls. Treatment started
at an average tumor volume of ~120–200 mm³. Tumor growth was measured every 2–3 days
using a caliper. Tumor volumes were calculated according to the formulas V=WxDxH
[mm³].
Statistics
Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between
treatment groups; the change in the natural logarithm of volume over time was estimated for
each animal from a linear regression and mean slopes were compared using a t-test. For the
SKMel28 animal study, p-values were adjusted according to Hochberg, 1988. The two-sided
Wilcoxon two-sample test was used when assumptions for the t-test were violated (Figure
3A), otherwise the Student’s t test was used. Box plots show the sample minimum (lower
whisker), the lower quartile (bottom of the box), the median (line inside the box), the upper
quartile (top of the box), and the sample maximum (upper whisker). A p value of less than
0.05 was considered significant. As software tools, SAS version 9.2 using Proc GLM and
Microsoft Excel were used.

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metastatic melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor of neuroectodermal origin with a median
survival below 9 months. All chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and radiotherapies have
failed to persistently increase survival. Despite the encouraging response rates following
BRAFV600E–targeting, relapses occur after a median duration of ~5 months because
melanoma cells acquire multiple resistance mechanisms. However, even among
functionally and genetically heterogeneous tumors, common and intrinsic mechanisms
exist that support the immediate survival of certain cells against the attack of cytotoxic
agents. We have identified a subpopulation of slow-cycling tumor-maintaining melanoma
cells with intrinsic phenotypic resistance to various therapies, irrespective of their mode
of action. Targeting the slow-cycling subpopulation could increase the efficacy of current
treatment regimens and reduce relapses.

(A) WM3734JARID1Bprom-EGFP cells were FACS-sorted according to their J/EGFP
expression and the isolated subfractions were cultured as adherent monolayers over night.
After subsequent treatment for 72 hr, the frequencies of J/EGFPhigh and J/EGFPlow cells
were again quantified by flow cytometry. Dead cells were detected by 7AAD staining.
JARID1B mRNA expression was quantified by QPCR. (B) Flow cytometric detection of J/
EGFPhigh WM3734 cells after prolonged incubation with different concentrations of
cisplatin and after drug recovery. (C) Colony forming assay of WM3734 cells that
underwent cytotoxic pulse treatment prior to seeding. Cells were treated for 72 hr with
cisplatin or vehicle. Surviving cells were subsequently embedded into soft agar (2000 cells/

Figure 5. Elevated mitochondrial bioenergy metabolism in the JARID1Bhigh subpopulation

(A) Immunoblotting of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes in FACS-sorted J/EGFPhigh and
J/EGFPlow WM3734 cells. Fold changes were normalized to GAPDH. (B) Relative
mitochondrial ATP levels in control (CTRL) or JARID1B-transfected WM3734 cells were
measured using the ATP sensor protein ATEAM. Representative ATEAM ratio images (top)
and summarized ATEAM ratio values in control (n=72) and JARID1B-transfected (n=47)
cells (bottom). (C) Mean oxygen consumption of control- (black) or JARID1B-transfected
(red) WM3734 cells presented as decline of trityl radical intensity per minute per 106 cells

independent experiments. (D) Relative H2O2 levels were measured in JARID1B-transfected
WM3734 cells using the H2O2 sensor protein Hyper. Columns represent averaged Hyper
ratio values of control- (black, n=71) or JARID1B-transfected cells (red, n=48). To test the
role of mitochondria as source of H2O2, cells were treated with 1 µM oligomycin (dark gray)
or 1 µM rotenone (light gray). Numbers of cells averaged were: CTRL plus oligomycin
(n=50), CTRL plus rotenone (n=42), JARID1B plus oligomycin (n=45) and JARID1B plus
rotenone (n=52). In a confirmation experiment with WM3734 cells transfected with
pCAGGS-JARID1B-IRES-RFP (right), positively transfected cells were selected for
analysis based on the expression of RFP. Error bars represent SEM. See also Table S1.
