Abstract
Drug-resistant cell lines are essential tools for investigating the mechanisms of
resistance to molecular-targeted anti-cancer drugs. However, little is known about
how to establish clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines. Our study examined the
impact of a drug-free period on the establishment of a cell line with clinically relevant
resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. We used PC9 cells, a lung cancer cell line
carrying EGFR mutation, because this is a validated target for EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI). PC9 cells were intermittently or continuously exposed to increasing
concentrations of gefitinib (0.01 µM to 1.0 µM) and the emergence of the most common
acquired resistance mutation in EGFR, T790M, was determined. T790M was detected
at a 25-fold lower drug concentration in cells continuously exposed to gefitinib
(PC9/GRc) than in cells intermittently exposed to gefitinib (PC9/GRi) (0.04 µM
vs 1.0 µM, respectively). The mutation frequencies at those drug concentrations
were 19.8% and 8.0% in PC9/GRc and PC9/GRi cells, respectively. After drug-free
culture for 8 weeks, resistance to gefitinib decreased in the PC9/GRi cells but not in
the PC9/GRc cells. In the PC9/GRc cells, the frequency of the T790M mutation was
consistently about 20% from 0.04 µM to 1.0 µM of gefitinib. In the PC9/GRc cells, the
T790M mutation was detected in all single-cell clones, at frequencies ranging from
7.0% to 37.0%, with a median of 19.5% (95% confidence interval, 17.3%–20.9%).
In conclusion, compared with intermittent drug exposure, continuous exposure
might select better minor drug-resistant clones when creating cell lines resistant to
molecular-targeted drugs.

Introduction

investigate the mechanisms involved in drug resistance [1].
An artificially-established cell line is more commonly
used in experiments to study the acquired drug resistance
mechanisms because it is not feasible to collect tissue
samples in many cases. However, an establishment of
drug-resistant cell lines is mainly laborious, which takes
from several months to years [2]. Furthermore, the clinical
relevance of some drug-resistant cancer cell lines remains
controversial [3, 4]. Thus, the appropriate strategy to
efficiently make a clinically-relevant drug-resistant cell
lines is much required to study the mechanism resistant to
molecularly-targeted drugs.

Recent technologic advances in identifying and
targeting driving gene alterations has allowed highly
effective and innovative treatments for human cancer to
be developed, particularly molecular-targeted therapies.
However, the emergence of drug resistance has become
an inevitable problem even in the era of anti-cancer
molecular-targeted therapies [1]. Thus, knowing the cause
of resistance to molecular-targeted drugs has been more
important to delay or overcome drug resistance. Both
tissue samples and cell lines are conventionally used to

the relevance of these regimens to the emergence of
clinically relevant drug resistance.

There are several critical decisions to be made
during the developing of drug resistant cell lines such
as the choice of parent cell line, drug dose, and interval
of drug treatment. Especially, drug treatment interval
was seriously considered in earlier studies for cell lines
resistant to conventional cytotoxic drugs like cisplatin
and doxorubicin. Most patient receiving cytotoxic drugs
are not continuously exposed to the drug, having the
recovery period. Thus, previous studies elucidated that
this treatment schedule might have an impact on the
development of drug resistance. Some studies used an
intermittent treatment method, in which the cells can
periodically recover in drug-free media like the patient’s
real treatment schedule [5–7]. Other studies applied a
continuous treatment method with stepwise drug dose
escalation to establish more stable resistance [8–10].
The intermittent drug treatment was inferior in stability
and strength of drug resistance whereas the continuous
drug treatment was less clinically relevant even though
it had high-level resistance [2]. On the other hand, for
molecularly-targeted drug resistance, it is unknown about
the impact of drug treatment schedule on making drugresistant cell line.
This study examined the impact of a drug-free
culture period on establishing a cell line with clinically
relevant resistance to a molecular-targeted drug because
previous studies using cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs
showed the characteristics and strength of acquired drug
resistance in an established cell line were influenced by a
drug-free interval. Thus, the current study was designed
to intermittently versus continuously expose a cancer cell
line to a molecular-targeted drug and to determine the
phenotypes and genotypes of the resistant cancer cells.
We used a lung cancer cell line carrying a mutation
in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR)
because this is a validated target for EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) [11–13]. EGFR-TKIs were the
first molecular-targeted drugs to dramatically change
the chemotherapeutic approach to lung cancer [14–16].
These drugs are particularly effective in lung cancers with
activating EGFR mutations such as exon 19 deletion and
exon 21 L858R mutation [11–13]. However, most cancers
that have initial huge response to EGFR-TKIs eventually
acquire drug resistance. Several mechanisms are
responsible for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and the
most common is the emergence of the T790M mutation
in exon 20 of EGFR [17–19]. This secondary resistance
mutation was detected in approximately 60% of rebiopsy
samples obtained from patients with acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs [17]. Furthermore, a preclinical study
using established drug-resistant cell lines revealed the
molecular mechanism of resistance induced by the T790M
in EGFR [20]. Therefore, we measured the frequency of
EGFR T790M in an EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell line
resistant to EGFR-TKIs, which were established using two
different drug-treatment regimens, in order to determine

Results
Generation of two drug-resistant cell lines
With continuous exposure to gefitinib (PC9/
GRc  cells), drug resistance was observed after 42 weeks,
whereas with intermittent exposure (PC9/GRi cells), drug
resistance was observed after 18 weeks (Figure 1A). The
gross morphologies and growth rates of both resistant
cell lines were similar (Figure 1B). Both cell lines also
displayed similar sensitivities to gefitinib (gefitinib
IC50, 17.8 μM in PC9/GRc and 15.8 μM in PC9/GRi)
(Figure  1C). Additionally, there was no difference in
migration activity between two cell lines (Figure 1D).

Long-term stability of gefitinib resistance
To assess the long-term stability of gefitinib
resistance, the sensitivity of both cell lines to gefitinib
was measured after drug-free culture for 8 weeks. The
sensitivity of the PC9/GRc cells to gefitinib was not
significantly different before and after drug-free culture
(gefitinib IC50, 17.0 μM and 13.5 μM before and after
drug-free culture, respectively) (Figure 2A). By contrast,
the sensitivity of the PC9/GRi cells was significantly
higher after drug-free culture compared with their
sensitivity before drug-free culture lines (gefitinib IC50,
15.9 μM and 1.04 μM before and after drug-free culture,
respectively) (Figure 2B).

EGFR T790M mutation
We next compared the frequency of the
EGFR T790M mutation in the two drug-resistant
cell lines. The Mass spectrometry (MS) assay was
performed in both cell lines established at serially
increasing concentrations of gefitinib (Figure 3).
The lowest drug concentration at which T790M was
detected was 0.04 µM in PC9/GRc cells and 1.0 µM in
PC9/GRi cells. The mutant allele frequency at the lowest
drug concentration at which T790M was detected was
19.8% in PC9/GRc cells and 8.0% in PC9/GRi cells.
In PC9/GRc cells, the allele frequency of T790M
was approximately 20% at the lowest drug concentration
at which T790M was detected and more, even at the
highest drug concentration. The frequency of the T790M
mutation in these cells did not increase as the drug
concentration increased. These results are consistent with
the results obtained with direct sequencing (Figure 4).
Although the height of the mutant chromatogram peak was
low, the peak corresponding to T790M was detected at
each concentration from 0.04 µM to 1.0 µM in PC9/GRc

cells, but was not detected in the PC9/GRi cells. The direct
sequencing chromatogram also showed that the height of
the T790M peak in the PC9/GRc cells did not increase as
the drug concentration increased.

Several studies support our finding that continuous
exposure to a molecular-targeted drug selects better drugresistant tumor cells than intermittent exposure [22, 23].
For example, using a mathematical cancer model and
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines, Chmielecki et al.
showed that a high–dose pulse dosing combined with
a continuous low dosing of EGFR-TKI delayed the
emergence of T790M-mediated resistance compared with
its emergence in cells treated with a continuous standard
dosing [22]. This research group has implemented a
phase I clinical trial based on these preclinical data. The
results of their studies should help us improve the clinical
efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of EGFRmutant lung cancers by delaying the emergence of drug
resistance. Additionally, Thakur et al. reported that drugresistant cells showed continuous dependence on a B-RAF
inhibitor in BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines and that
an intermittent dosing strategy delayed the onset of drug
resistance in a xenograft tumor model [23]. Based on these
preclinical data, a clinical trial has been commenced to
compare the efficacy of intermittent dosing and continuous
dosing with a B-RAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor in
patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.
Interestingly, there is an apparent drug concentration
at which the expansion of drug-resistant clones plateaus,
because the frequency of T790M remained constant
once the drug concentration exceeded this value. This
indicates that the strength of resistance does not correlate
positively with the frequency of the resistance mutation.
Unfortunately, we could not determine the clinical
relevance of these results because there are no clinical
data on the frequency of the EGFR T790M mutation
in drug-resistant tumor tissues. However, if we knew
the threshold concentration at which drug resistance is
expected to develop, we could save time and labor in
producing cell lines with resistance to molecular-targeted
drug that mimic the molecular characteristics of human
tumors. In addition, we observed individual clones within
PC9 cell population acquiring resistance to gefitinib have
a different allele frequency of T790M mutation. This
finding may be explained by innate clonal heterogeneity
of the tumor. Several clinical studies suggested the
presence of clone with T790M-resistant mutation before
exposure to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant lung cancer
[24–26]. The recent preclinical study by Hata A.N. et al
directly detected the pre-existing EGFR-T790M clones
in PC9 cell carrying 8 to 10 copies of EGFR gene [27].
Therefore, it is necessary to consider clonal diversity in
the phenotypes and genotypes of single-cell drug-resistant
clones when they are used to examine the mechanisms of
drug resistance.
In conclusion, cancer cell lines are an important tool
in studying the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in
human cancer. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms
responsible for the resistant phenotype of cell lines can
vary according to the conditions used to establish the

Intra-cell-line T790M heterogeneity
We examined whether there was intra-cell-line
heterogeneity in the frequency of the EGFR T790M
mutation in the PC9/GRc cells. Overall, 54 single-cell
clones were isolated from PC9/GRc cells established with
continuous exposure to 1.0 µM gefitinib. The MS assay
for T790M was performed for each single-cell clone.
T790M was detected in all single-cell clones, but the allele
frequencies ranged considerably, from 7.0% to 37.0%,
with a median of 19.5% (95% confidence interval 17.3%–
20.9%; Figure 5). The frequency of T790M in PC9/GRc
clone 51 was substantially lower than that in PC9/GRc
clone 49, so these two representative single-cell clones
displayed the heterogeneity of T790M. This heterogeneity
was also detected with direct sequencing (Figure 6).

Discussion
This study tried to evaluate the effect of drug-free
period in acquiring resistance to molecularly-targeted
drugs in a cancer cell line. In this study, the intermittent
drug exposure led to the establishment of cells with
less stable drug resistance than the continuous drug
exposure. Furthermore, the intermittent drug treatment
was less effectively induced the emergence of the EGFR
T790M mutation which is the most common resistance
mechanism found in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients
treated by EGFR-TKI, compared with the continuous drug
treatment. We could not detect EGFR T790M mutation in
the PC9/GRi cells by a standard direct sequencing method
having a detection limit of about 20%, even when they
had the highest-level resistance to the drug. These findings
are consistent with those of another study in which the
researchers used intermittent drug exposure to establish a
lung cancer cell line resistant to an EGFR-TKI [21]. Rho
et al. generated resistant PC9 cells by exposing them to
gefitinib or erlotinib for 48 h, maintaining them in drugfree medium, and then re-exposing them to increasing
concentrations of the drug to a final concentration of
1.0 μM. They were unable to detect T790M in the drugresistant cell lines with direct sequencing, although when
they used the more sensitive pyrosequencing method, the
mutation frequency was 13%~14%. These results suggest
that when the drug selection pressure gets removed, the
residual drug-sensitive clones can be restored, expand,
and then suppressed the expansion of other drugresistant clones. Taken together, these findings indicate
that continuous drug exposure offers an advantage over
intermittent drug exposure in terms of long stability and
mimicking the molecular change observed in the patients.

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification was performed with 5 µl of
the extracted genomic DNA, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase,
0.25  mM each dNTP, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 40 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, and 20 pmol of the primers in a final volume
of 20 µl. The following primers were used to amplify exon
20 of EGFR: 5ʹ-CCATGAGTACGTATTTTGAAAC- TC-3ʹ
(forward) and 5ʹ-CATATCCCCATGGCAAACTCTTGC3ʹ (reverse). The PCR cycling parameters were 95°C for 5
min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for
30 s, followed by a final step at 72°C for 10 min. After the
PCR products were purified, they were directly sequenced
with the MegaBACE DNA Analysis System (Amersham
Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), with a standard
published protocol.

Materials and Methods
Cell line and reagents
PC9 cells, a human lung cancer cell line carrying
a deletion in exon 19 (DelE746A750) of EGFR, were
purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center Cell Bank
(Ibaraki, Japan). The cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. An
EGFR-TKI, gefitinib (Iressa®), was purchased from LC
Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA).

Mass spectrometry (MS) assay
The EGFR T790M mutation was detected in the
cells with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight MS using a standard protocol, on the
MassARRAY System (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).
The mutant signal frequency was calculated as follows:
mutant signal frequency (%) = (mutant peak height)/
(mutant peak height + wild-type peak height) × 100.

Establishment of gefitinib-resistant cell lines
The gefitinib-resistant cell line (PC9/GR) was
generated by continuously exposing PC9 cells to increasing
concentrations of gefitinib. Starting at a concentration of
0.01 μM, the exposure dose was doubled until it reached
a final concentration of 1.0 μM. We used two different
drug treatment regimens, intermittent and continuous
exposure (Figure 1A). Cells in the intermittent treatment
group (PC9/GRi) were exposed to gefitinib in culture
medium for 72 h, washed, and then cultured in gefitinibfree medium until their growth rate was similar to that of
the parental cells. The cells in the continuous treatment
group (PC9/GRc) were continuously exposed to gefitinib
at a given concentration and the medium was not changed
to drug-free medium at any time. When the growth rate
of these cells was equal to that of the parental cells, they
were exposed to increasing concentrations of gefitinib.
The drug-resistant phenotypes of both groups of cells were
confirmed with a cell viability assay. An aliquot of cells
was stored before each increase in the dose of gefitinib.

Single-cell clone assay
Individual clones were established from the resistant
cell lines. Briefly, 4 × 103 drug-resistant cells were serially
diluted and then incubated in 96-well plates. Each well
was checked to identify those that contained a single
colony. These colonies were picked from the wells and
subcultured in larger vessels.

Cell migration assay
The migration assay was performed using transwell
plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) that were
6.5 mm in diameter with 8 μm pore filter. The RPMI
medium containing 10% FBS was inserted into the
lower chamber. Cells were plated in 1.5 ml of serum-free
RPMI per filter with a cell density of 5 × 104. Cells were
allowed to migrate in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 72 hr and were
subsequently fixed by immersion of the filters in methanol
at room temperature for 15 min. Filters were washed and
stained in 0.2% crystal violet in a 20% methanol/water
solution for 10 min. Cells were removed from the upper
chamber with a cotton swab. The absorbance at 590 nm
of each filters was measured with an enzyme-labeling
measuring instrument (Gene Company Limited).

Cell viability assay
The cells were cultured in gefitinib-free medium
for ≥ 1 week before testing. The cells were then seeded
at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates. After
24 h, the cells were exposed to different concentrations
of gefitinib and were incubated for 72 h. The cells were
then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the cell
viability was measured with the CellTiter 96® AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
We estimated IC50 for gefitnib using GraphPad software.
