BACKGROUND: Women with advanced bladder cancer have inferior survival compared with men. However, women treated on clinical
trials do not appear to have a survival disadvantage. Less frequent administration of systemic chemotherapy in women with
advanced bladder cancer may contribute to their inferior survival. METHODS: The authors identified patients diagnosed with stage IV
bladder cancer from 1998 through 2010 using the National Cancer Data Base, a national outcomes database that includes 70% of all
newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States. Sex differences in demographics, systemic chemotherapy administration, and
overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 23,981 patients were identified (35% of whom were female). Compared
with men, women were older, more likely to be black, and less likely to be insured (P<.01 for all). The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity
score did not differ between men and women. Women were less likely to receive systemic chemotherapy than men (45% vs 52%;
adjusted relative risk, 0.91 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-0.94]). Women had a lower median OS compared with men (8.0
months [95% CI, 7.7-8.3 months] vs 9.8 months [95% CI, 9.5-10.0 months]; P<.001). OS remained lower for women on multivariable
analysis, even after adjusting for the administration of systemic chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Women are less likely than men to receive systemic chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer and this difference may
partially account for the poorer OS observed in women. However, OS remains lower in women independent of chemotherapy use,

INTRODUCTION
Overall, after a diagnosis of cancer, women have improved survival compared with men.1 However, this is not true with a
diagnosis of bladder cancer. Although men are nearly 3 times more likely to develop bladder cancer than women in the
United States,2 women are more likely to die of the disease.1 This survival disadvantage among women occurs across all
stages of disease, but is more pronounced in those with advanced stages, with an estimated 12% difference in the 5-year
survival reported between men and women with stage IV disease.3-5
To the best of our knowledge, the cause of the survival disparity between sexes is not clear. It is interesting to note
that women with advanced bladder cancer who are treated with chemotherapy on clinical trials do not appear to have a
survival disadvantage compared with men.6 Although this may mean that women in clinical trials are not representative of
the general population, it also suggests that less frequent administration of standard chemotherapy could contribute to the
survival disadvantage noted among women with advanced disease. To our knowledge, it is not known whether women
with advanced bladder cancer are less likely than men to receive systemic chemotherapy.
The current study used a large national database to examine rates of chemotherapy use and survival among women
and men with advanced bladder cancer. We hypothesized that women with advanced bladder cancer are less likely to
receive chemotherapy than men, and that the difference in the frequency of chemotherapy use explains the survival disadvantage observed in women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The data source for the current study was the National
Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a nationwide oncology outcomes database established in 1989 that includes approximately 70% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the
United States annually. The NCDB is a collaboration of
the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society in
which all types of cancer are included. Data are collected
using national standardized data item and coding definitions as specified by the CoC’s Facility Oncology Registry
Data Standards and include patient and facility characteristics, cancer stage, treatment, and outcomes.7 The American College of Surgeons has executed a business associate
agreement that includes a data use agreement with each of
its CoC-accredited hospitals.
Patient Population

The NCDB was queried for all patients with stage IV
bladder cancer who were diagnosed between 1998 and
2010. Staging was defined by the NCDB Analytic Stage
Group, which reports the American Joint Committee on
Cancer TNM pathologic stage if available or the clinical
stage if the pathologic stage is not available. The year
2010 was the latest year for which 3-year survival data
were available and therefore was the last year included in
the current analysis. Patients were excluded if they did not
have information regarding systemic treatment or were
lost to follow-up within 1 month.
Data Items

We collected patient demographics, facility information,
tumor characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Demographic variables included sex, age, race, education,
household income, insurance status, region of the country, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score. Race was classified as white, black, or other. Education was defined as
the percentage of adults within the patient’s zip code who
did not graduate from high school and was categorized as
29%, 20% to 28.9%, 14% to 19.9%, and <14%.
Household income was defined as the quartile of median
household income for each patient’s area of residence
based on zip code. Insurance status was dichotomized as
insured or not insured. Region of the country was categorized as South, Northeast, West, and Midwest. Comorbidities were estimated using the Charlson-Deyo
comorbidity index, with a score of 0 (no comorbid conditions), 1, or 2 as per NCDB standards.8

Facility-level information included facility type
(community-based practice or cancer programs, academic
or research programs, and other) and distance to the diagnosing facility. The distance from the patient’s residence
to the diagnosing facility was estimated by the NCDB
using the patient’s and facility’s zip codes. Tumor characteristics included histology and the presence of lymph
node or distant metastases. Patients with stage IV disease
were identified using the NCDB analytic stage, which
uses the pathologic stage if reported and the clinical stage
if the pathologic stage is not reported. Receipt of chemotherapy was defined as receipt of any cancer-directed systemic therapy. Receipt of cystectomy also was recorded.
Outcomes included median overall survival (OS) and 1year, 3-year, and 5-year OS. Survival was defined as the
time between the date of diagnosis and the date of death.
Statistical Analysis

Chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables between men and women, and Student t tests were
used for continuous variables. Modeling was used as a tool
to evaluate the relation between sex and outcome while
controlling for important covariates that were specified a
priori based on availability in the data set and clinical expertise.9 Patients with incomplete data (approximately
15%) were excluded from modeling fitting. Poisson
regression was performed, and risk ratios were reported,
to evaluate predictors of chemotherapy administration,
including sex.10 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
estimate OS. Cox proportional hazards modeling was
used to evaluate factors associated with OS and compare
survival between sexes with adjustment for potential confounders after graphically confirming that the proportional hazards assumption held for all covariates.
Chemotherapy receipt was treated as a time-varying covariate based on time from diagnosis to the initiation of
treatment with chemotherapy. All statistical tests were 2sided and a P value <.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Because all patient information was deidentified in
the NCDB, the current study was approved for exempt
status by the University of North Carolina Institutional
Review Board.
RESULTS
A total of 23,981 patients were identified. The median
age of the patients was 69 years; approximately 35% were
female, 88% were white, and 96% were insured. Of the
patients, 38% had clinical evidence of distant metastatic

disease at the time of diagnosis (an additional 8% had distant metastatic disease diagnosed pathologically). Approximately 25% of the patients had clinically positive lymph
nodes (44% of the patients were not able to be assessed,
and 31% were found to have negative lymph nodes).
Approximately 40% of the patients had pathologically
positive lymph nodes (53% were not able to be assessed,
and 7% were found to have negative lymph nodes).
Patients were categorized as having stage IV disease as follows: 6.3% with T4N0M0, 44.2% with TxN1-3M0,
46.2% with TxNxM1, and 3.2% with an unknown
TNM stage of disease.
Differences in demographic variables between sexes
are summarized in Table 1.
Women were older than men at the time of diagnosis (median age, 71 years vs 68 years; P<.01). Women
also were more likely than men to be black (13% vs 8%;
P<.01) and were more likely to be insured (97% vs 96%;
P<.01). The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score did not
appear to differ between men and women. Women were
less likely to have distant metastatic disease (P<.01) and
more likely to undergo cystectomy (P 5 .003). Women
were more likely to have a higher T classification than
men (P<.01). However, women were less likely to have
clinically positive lymph nodes than men (24% vs 26%;
P<.01). Women also were less likely to have pathologically positive lymph nodes than men (39% vs 40%; P 5
.03).
Women were less likely to receive systemic chemotherapy than men (45% vs 52%; relative risk [RR], 0.86
[95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.83-0.88]). This
difference remained significant after adjusting for age,
year of diagnosis, race, insurance status, distance to and
location of the facility, income, education, facility type,
Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, histology, receipt of
cystectomy, clinical T classification, and the presence of
lymph node and distant metastases (RR, 0.91 [95% CI,
0.88-0.94]). Factors found to be associated with a lower
likelihood of receiving chemotherapy on multivariable
analysis included older age, black race, lower educational
level, lack of insurance, less comorbidity, unknown or
nonurothelial histology, higher T classification, and the
presence of distant metastatic disease (Table 2).
Among the patients who underwent cystectomy
(37% of the total population), women remained less likely
to receive chemotherapy than men (49% vs 54%; RR,
0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.94]). This difference was no longer
found to be statistically significant in the multivariable
model (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91-1.00]). Women also
remained less likely to receive chemotherapy than men
2014

when the analysis was restricted to those patients who had
distant metastatic disease (41% vs 48%; RR, 0.84 [95%
CI, 0.80-0.89]) and the difference remained statistically
significant after adjustment for covariates (RR, 0.88 [95%
CI, 0.84-0.93]).
Women had a lower median OS compared with
men (8.0 months [95% CI, 7.7-8.3 months] vs 9.8
months [95% CI, 9.5-10.0 months]; P<.001), with a
hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.09-1.15)
(Fig. 1) (Table 3). OS remained lower for women on multivariable analysis after adjusting for age, year of diagnosis,
race, insurance status, distance to facility, location of facility, income, education, facility type, Charlson-Deyo
comorbidity score, histology, receipt of cystectomy, clinical T classification, presence of lymph node and distant
metastases, and receipt of chemotherapy as a time-varying
covariate (HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.15]). Other factors
found to be associated with improved survival in the
adjusted model included younger age, white race, higher
household income, presence of insurance, treatment at a
community program, lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity
score, urothelial histology, lower T classification, and absence of lymph node or distant metastases (Table 4).
Receipt of chemotherapy also was found to be associated
with improved survival. Among patients who underwent
cystectomy, the adjusted HR for death in women compared with men was 1.05 (95% CI, 1.00-1.11). Among
patients with distant metastatic disease, the adjusted HR
was 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05-1.16). OS rates are listed by sex
in Table 3, with a median follow-up of 24 months for the
survivors (range, 1-168 months).
DISCUSSION
In the current analysis using the NCDB, women were
found to be less likely than men to receive systemic chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer. Although this difference may partially account for the survival
disadvantage noted among women compared with men,
OS remains lower in women independent of chemotherapy use.
The cause of the disparity in chemotherapy use may
be related to several factors. The majority of research in
this area has focused on sex differences in tumor characteristics such as histology and stage of disease, and health
care-related factors such as time to diagnosis and surgical
mortality.11 Women with bladder cancer tend to be older
at the time of diagnosis, although the results of the current
study demonstrated that the disparity in chemotherapy
use between men and women remained significant even
after adjusting for age. Women may be less likely to be

receive chemotherapy, with an RR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.890.95), which is similar to the RR of women compared with
men. Patients with distant metastases generally are less
healthy than those without distant metastases, suggesting
the possibility that the sex disparity could be related to fitness as well. However, a prior study by Konety and Joslyn
demonstrated that women with stage IV bladder cancer
have the same rates of radical cystectomy and slightly higher
rates of radiotherapy compared with men,12 thereby suggesting that fitness for aggressive treatment may not differ
between sexes. We did find that women were more likely to
have a higher T classification but were less likely to have
clinically positive lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis, a
finding that perhaps is related to the greater difficulty in
staging with conventional imaging studies, although
women also were found to have lower rates of pathologically positive lymph nodes. Data are conflicting with regard
to whether perioperative complication rates are indeed different between women and men, but sex-specific differences in postoperative recovery could influence rates of
adjuvant chemotherapy administration.13-16 The current
study data indicated that the sex disparity in chemotherapy
administration is less pronounced among those patients
who undergo cystectomy, suggesting that differences in the
perioperative use of chemotherapy and surgical complications are less likely to explain the findings.
Sex disparity in systemic treatment rates has been
documented in other diseases, despite the overall resource

use of health care spending being higher for women.17 In
particular, women with cardiovascular disease have lower
rates of evidence-based medication use such as aspirin and
statins compared with men.18-21 To the best of our
knowledge, sex disparities in the receipt of chemotherapy
have been less well studied. The results of the current
study align with the existing oncologic literature, including a recent analysis of patients with stage IV pancreatic
cancer, in which decreased use of systemic therapy was
found in women compared with men.22 Other studies
also have demonstrated a decreased use of chemotherapy
in female patients compared with men among those with
lymphoma,23 renal cell carcinoma,24 and colon cancer.25
However, a causative association between lower rates of
chemotherapy use and decreased survival among women
is unclear.
The survival rates noted in the current study overall
appear to be in agreement with prior studies of patients
with stage IV bladder cancer. Mungan et al found the 5year OS rate of stage IV bladder cancer to be 11.7% in
men and 9.6% in women in a study cohort from the
Netherlands, and 27% in men and 15% in women using

cohort had distant metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, which may explain the lower survival compared
with that noted in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results program analysis. The survival rates in the
current study are significantly lower than published rates
reported in clinical trials (8-10 months vs 14-15 months,
respectively), and are likely more reflective of a typical oncology practice.26 We found the median OS of patients
with distant metastatic disease was <5 months, suggesting
that many patients die soon after diagnosis and reflecting
the limited effective treatment options for this population. In terms of the survival disparity between sexes,
Micheli et al found an overall estimated 1.3 relative excess
risk of death in women with bladder cancer compared
with men (95% CI, 1.27-1.33),1 a finding that is similar
to our unadjusted HR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.09-1.15). The
finding of an association between treatment at an academic medical center and decreased survival in the current
study is likely reflective of referral bias, with sicker patients
being treated at academic centers.
Women are more likely to have a delay in diagnosis27 and more likely to present with muscle-invasive disease at the time of diagnosis,11 although such differences
do not explain the large disparity in survival noted among
patients with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.
Prior studies have suggested that women more often present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, which
may contribute to the survival disadvantage noted among
women.28 Because OS was defined as starting from the
date of diagnosis, it is possible that even among patients
with stage IV disease, men are diagnosed earlier and therefore appear to have a survival benefit over women that is
in reality just an artifact of diagnostic efficiency. The
results of the current study found that women did have a
higher T classification, but were less likely to harbor
lymph node and distant metastases, suggesting that diagnostic delay is not the only contributing factor. Decreased
functional status or a high burden of unmeasured comorbidities in women also could be a potential explanation
for the survival disparity. Ultimately, the cause of the sex
survival disparity in patients with advanced bladder cancer
remains unclear.
Recently, distinct molecular subtypes of high-grade
bladder cancer have been identified as “basal” and
“luminal,” which have clinically meaningful differences in
outcome.29,30 Basal-like tumors are associated with
decreased disease-specific survival and OS. It is interesting
to note that women have a significantly higher incidence
of basal-like bladder cancer compared with men.29 In
addition, black individuals are also more likely to have the
Cancer

basal-like subtype of bladder cancer, and the data from
the current study indicate that women with bladder cancer
are more likely to be black.31 Therefore, the results of the
current study support the premise that tumor biology
may partially be responsible for the inferior survival noted
in women. Differences in tumor biology also have been
suggested as an explanation for the lower incidence rates
of bladder cancer noted in women, mostly focusing on a
potentially deleterious effect of male sex hormones (or a
lack of female sex hormones).32 However, sex hormones
alone are unlikely to explain the survival disparity after diagnosis across ages.
A limitation of the current study was the inability to
fully account for socioeconomic status and functional status. We were able to classify insurance on a patient-level
basis, but education and household income were based on
each patient’s zip code. The NCDB also does not report
smoking or other environmental exposures that may be
important to the pathogenesis and natural history of bladder cancer, which also limited the current analysis. However, prior data have suggested that the populationattributable risk of smoking in the pathogenesis of bladder
cancer is similar between men and women.33 In addition,
although we were able to control for time from diagnosis
to the initiation of chemotherapy, we were unable to control for the type and duration of the chemotherapy
received.
The results of the current study indicate that women
are less likely to receive chemotherapy for stage IV bladder
cancer, even after controlling for multiple potential confounders. Women also have inferior OS compared with
men independent of chemotherapy use, perhaps related to
unmeasured comorbidities, functional status, or tumor
biology. Future research should focus on the difference in
treatment decisions in men and women, as well as the differences in tumor biology between the sexes.
