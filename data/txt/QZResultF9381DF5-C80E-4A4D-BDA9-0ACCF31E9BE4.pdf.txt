BACKGROUND: Relatively few sarcomas harbor TP53 (tumor protein p53) mutations, but in many cases, amplification of MDM2 (murine
double minute 2) effectively inactivate p53. The p53 pathway activity can also be affected by normal genetic variation. METHODS: The
mutation status of TP53 and expression of MDM2, TP53, and their genetic variants SNP309 and R72P (Arg72Pro) were investigated in
125 sarcoma patient samples and 18 sarcoma cell lines. Association of the different genotypes and gene aberrations with chemotherapy
response and survival, as well as response to MDM2 antagonists in vitro was evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of the tumors
had mutant TP53 and 20% MDM2 gene amplification. Patients with wild-type TP53 (TP53Wt) tumors had improved survival (P < .001)
and TP53Wt was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio ¼ 0.41; 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.23-0.74; P ¼ .03). Interestingly,
there was a trend toward longer time to progression after chemotherapy for tumors with the apoptosis-prone p53 variant R72 (P ¼
.07), which was strongest with doxorubicin/ifosfamide-based regimens (P ¼ .01). Liposarcomas had low R72 frequency (33% versus
56%), but increased levels of MDM2 and MDM4 (51% and 11%, P < .001). MDM2 overexpression on a TP53Wt background predicted better response to MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a, irrespective of R72P or SNP309 status. CONCLUSIONS: Improved survival after chemotherapy was found in patients with TP53Wt tumors harboring the R72 variant. MDM2 overexpression in TP53Wt tumors predicted good
response to MDM2 antagonists, irrespective of R72P or SNP309 status. Thus, detailed TP53 and MDM2 genotype analyses prior to

In addition to direct mutations, p53 can be inactivated by abrogation of other components of the signaling pathway or
effector molecules that convey p53 downstream effects.1 In sarcomas, TP53 (tumor protein p53) mutations are infrequent,2 but in the wild-type TP53 (TP53Wt) tumors, p53 may be inactivated by amplification of the mouse double minute
2 (MDM2) gene (MDM2Ampl), in particular, in well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLS).3-5 Complementary mechanisms have been suggested,6,7 but it is still unclear whether and how the pathway is inactivated in the remaining tumors.
In addition to rare predisposition syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni,8 more frequent normal genetic variation of
TP53 and MDM2 is reported to influence cancer risk, progression and overall survival.9-12 A polymorphism replacing arginine (R72) with proline (P72) at position 72 in p53 (codon72 polymorphism, referred to as R72P) has been reported to
affect p53 function.13 It has been shown that R72 increases the affinity of p53 to MDM2, affects its export from the nucleus, and provides increased apoptotic potential.14-16 The MDM2 polymorphism, SNP309, changes a base from T to G
at nucleotide position 309 in the MDM2 promoter. This polymorphism is located in a binding site for the Sp1 transcription factor, and a G gives increased expression level of MDM2, hence reduced apoptotic response.17 The SNP309G may
also give higher sensitivity to MDM2 antagonists such as Nutlin-3a.18 The reported frequencies of these polymorphisms
vary (eg, 23%-67% for P72,19 with 58% in Norwegians,20 and 8%-58% for SNP309G, with 55% in Norwegians21).
Here, we investigate whether these normal variants and somatic aberrations of TP53 or MDM2 in tumor material may
affect disease outcome, and also how they may relate to Nutlin-3a responses in vitro.

by the ethical committee of Southern Norway (Projects S06133 and S-06134). Samples were collected immediately
after surgery, cut into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C until use. Only malignant
tumors confirmed by an experienced pathologist according to World Health Organization guidelines22 were
used, categorized in Table 1. The clinical information was
retrieved from the hospital’s quality database (http://medinfo.net/medinsight/), and 125 untreated tumor samples
were included in the analysis.
Cell Lines

We used 18 sarcoma cell lines; 9 osteosarcomas (OHS,
MHM, KPD, IOR/OS14, IOR/OS15, IOR/MOS,
U2OS [HTB96], SaOS-2 [HTB85], and OSA [SJSA-1 or
CRL2098]) described in Ottaviano et al,23 4 liposarcomas
(T449, T778, Fu-ddl-S1, and SW872 [HTB92]), and 1
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS13) described in Müller et al.24
In addition, SA-4 (CRL7938) was obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, Va), WLS-160 was given by Dr. Boven (Academic Hospital Vrije Universiteit, the Netherlands), and
RMS4 and RMS28 by Dr. Look and Dr. Houghton (St
Jude’s Hospital, Memphis, Tenn). All cell lines were
grown as described in Ohnstad et al.25
DNA Quantification by Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction

Frozen tissue was pulverized in liquid nitrogen and DNA
isolated by phenol chloroform. Copy number analysis of
MDM2 and MDM4 (also known as MDMX) was done by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using FastStartSYBRGreen (Roche). Oligonucleotide primers used were MDM2-Forward (50 -AAGCCAAACTG
GAAAACTCAACAC-30 ), MDM2-Reverse (50 -CAGGA
ACATCAAAGCCCTCTTC-30 ), MDM4-Forward (50 -C
AGCAGGAGCAGCATATGGTATA-30 ) and MDM4Reverse (50 -GAAGCTCTGACGTCCCAGTAG-30 ). ALB
was used as internal reference, using the primers ALB-Forward (50 -TTTATTCACATCATTCTCTC-30 ) and ALBReverse (50 -GAGTGAGATATGAGTTGAG-30 ). Universal Human Reference DNA (Promega) was used as normal
control. The fold-change was determined by the delta-Ct
method. Fold-change < 0.5 was scored as loss, between 0.5
and 2 as normal, between 2 and 5 as gain, and amplification
as > 5. Samples with PCR failure for target (n ¼ 2) or reference (n ¼ 7) were excluded from further analysis, 2 samples
were missing.

TP53 somatic mutations and polymorphic variants
(frequency of 1% or higher) in tumors and cell lines were
scored by the AmpliChip p53 test (Roche/Affymetrix, in
development), a DNA microarray-based sequence-variant
scoring method.26 The PCR failed completely in 4 samples and partly in 7 samples (exon 3 in 6 samples, exon 7
in 1 sample). In cases of partial failure, sequence variations
detected were registered, but obviously this could lead to
underestimation of mutants and variants.
MDM2SNP309

The region surrounding SNP309 was amplified
using flanking intronic primers, and the restriction
enzyme MspA1I was used to cut the PCR products. The
fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis on a
Megabase-1000 (GE Healthcare) and the variants indicated as TT, GG, and TG, respectively.27 Samples without
detectable fragments (n ¼ 7) were excluded.
Statistical Analysis

Association between genotypes and clinicopathologic factors was assessed using Pearson chi-squared test/Fisher
exact test and independent 2-tailed t test. Time to recognized metastasis or sarcoma-related death was used as time
to progression (TTP). Disease-specific survival (DSS) was
time from day of diagnosis until death of disease or last
follow-up. Survival probabilities were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and assessed by log-rank test. Cox
regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounding clinical variables (Table 1) and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Ill), and P values < .05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Clinical characteristics of primary tumors and treatmentspecific data are given in Table 1 (n ¼ 125). A total of 114
samples were informative for SNP309 and MDM2/
MDM4 copy number, 74 for expression (including the
major subtypes: liposarcoma [LS], osteosarcoma [OS],
leiomyosarcoma [LMS], malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor [MPNST], and malignant fibrous histiocytoma [MFH]) and 121 for TP53 genotype. Complete
results were available for 62 samples. The genotype frequencies are listed in Table 2.
P72 was most frequent in LS compared to all other
subgroups (P ¼ .05; Fig. 1A), particularly if WDLS or
other/unknown LS (n ¼ 10 and 8). Although R72 enrichment was noted in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST),
MPNST, and synovial sarcoma (SS), it was not significant.
TP53Mut was detected in 27 samples (21.6%), of which 13
had the P72 variant. Fourteen cases had mutation in more
than one position. The majority of mutations (23 of 29)
occurred in exons 4 through 8, primarily exon 5 and 8,
without codon preference. Seven mutations occurred outside the DNA-binding domain. Twelve of the TP53 mutations were not previously reported in sarcoma.19,27
TP53Mut dominated in LMS (63%, P ¼ .01, Fig. 1A),
whereas the frequency of TP53Mut was low in LS (6%,
P ¼ .01). No TP53Mut was detected in GIST, MPNST or
SS, but this was not significant (P > .2).
No significant differences in SNP309 distribution
among histological subgroups were found (Fig. 1B).
However, there was a tendency toward lower SNP309G

frequency in SS (P ¼ .06), and among LS, only WDLS
displayed the GG genotype. MDM2Ampl was observed in
20% of samples and MDM4Ampl in 3%. As expected, the
frequency of MDM2Ampl was high in LS (51%, 81% in
WDLS, and 44% in other/unknown LSs) compared with
the other subtypes (P < .001; Fig. 1C), and MDM4Ampl
was only observed in myxoid or other LSs (11%; Fig. 1D).
Correlations Between Genotypes

The samples from major subtypes having a maximum of 2
missing data points were included in the analysis of patterns of genotypes/phenotypes. The results are visualized
in a heat map in Figure 2. There was a strong correlation
between MDM2 copy number and expression (P < .001).
In general, TP53 mutation and MDM2 amplification was
mutually exclusive with 2 exceptions: LS03 and MFH53.
However, none of these expressed high level of MDM2.
LS stands out with 93% TP53Wt samples, of which 80%
had MDM2 overexpression. Notably, only 24% of
TP53Wt samples were scored as TP53Norm for expression.
1016

MDM4 was also overexpressed in a substantial fraction of
TP53Wt LS samples (52%, MDM4High), with a strong
correlation with MDM2 expression (P < .001). No
skewed distribution of R72P was observed in MDM2Ampl
samples. However, almost all SNP309G in LS samples
coexisted with MDM2 overexpression, but not
conversely.
The OS samples showed the same pattern of
MDM4 overexpression in TP53Wt samples, where
MDM2 was also overexpressed. P72 was observed together with TP53Mut in 67% of LMS. Except for the
MFHs, of which about half had TP53Mut and almost all
had MDM2Gain, no other specific patterns were found.
No clear association of SNP309G and other genotypes/
phenotypes could be seen.

No statistical differences were observed with respect
to R72P polymorphism, but patients with TP53Mut had
shorter DSS and TTP than those with TP53Wt (P < .001;
Fig. 3A). Despite the importance of TP53 status for survival (hazard ratio[DSS] ¼ 0.41, 95% confidence interval
¼ 0.23-0.74, P ¼ .03 and hazard ratio[TTP] ¼ 0.43,
95% confidence interval ¼ 0.25-0.73, P ¼ .02), multivariate analysis revealed that axial localization increased the
risk of sarcoma-related death 2-fold.

No statistical differences in DSS or TTP were
detected for the SNP309 genotypes (Fig. 3B) or between
histological subtypes, except in WDLS, which showed significantly better DSS and TTP than the other LSs. Both
MDM2 copy number and expression levels correlated
with prognosis: lower levels indicated shorter DSS and
TTP (Fig. 3C,D). However, this was not significant in
multivariate analysis, where absence of metastasis at diagnosis correlated with better DSS, and axial localization
was associated with more than 3-fold increased risk of sarcoma-related death (hazard ratio ¼ 3.64, 95% confidence

Response to Chemotherapy

Response to Nutlin-3a

Complete information about radiotherapy was not
available; hence analysis of treatment response was restricted to chemotherapy. A total of 43 patients received
chemotherapy at least once: doxorubicin (30%), ifosfamide (26%) or a combination of these (28%) as regimen
backbone. Doxorubicin was typically given at a dose of 50
to 75 mg/m2 and ifosfamide 4.5 to 9 g/m2 per cycle.
Response to treatment was estimated as TTP. Median
TTP in this selected cohort was 14 months.
Interestingly, there was a tendency toward longer
TTP after chemotherapy with the apoptosis-prone R72
variant (compared with P72, P ¼ .07; Fig. 4A). Patients
with R72 responded significantly better to the doxorubicin/ifosfamide combination, although the number of
patients was limited (P ¼ .01; Fig. 4B). No significance
was found for ifosfamide alone, doxorubicin alone, or
other regimens, and no confounding factors were identified in univariate analysis. Hence, R72P status appears to

The cell line characteristics and genotypes are outlined in Table 3. One-third of the cell lines were TP53Mut,
four with mutations not previously reported in sarcomas.
All RMS cell lines were TP53Mut, whereas the majority of
LS and OS cell lines were TP53Wt. None of the TP53Mut
lines had SNP309G. All TP53Wt LS cell lines expressed
high MDM2 level, whereas TP53Wt OS cell lines were either MDM2Ampl/MDM2High or MDM2Gain/MDM2Norm.
In the latter cases, SNP309G was always present. Both variants of R72P were present in LS and OS cell lines, R72
only together with SNP309G in LS. As all LS were
MDM2Ampl, no relation between R72 and MDM2Ampl
could be observed. Similarly, no association was found in
OS cell lines, and no significant relation with MDM4 was
observed.

lines to Nutlin-3a.24,25,28 All cell lines sensitive to Nutlin3a harboredTP53Wt together with MDM2Ampl or

DISCUSSION
Mutations in TP53 are less frequent and more heterogeneous in sarcomas than in other cancer types,29 and in
addition to the amplification and overexpression of
MDM2, other mechanisms, including MDM4 amplification, may be involved.4,6,7,30 The hypothesis that
MDM2Ampl and TP53Mut both provide inactivation of the
p53 response has been challenged by the occasional report
that the 2 aberrations may be found in the same tumor.31
We found such apparent double mutations in 2 samples,
LS03 and MFH53 (Fig. 2). However, none of these
expressed MDM2, thus confirming the hypothesis that
MDM2Ampl and TP53Mut are mutually exclusive. Most
likely, the amplification of the locus containing MDM2
was selected for by overexpression of other genes, such as
CDK4 or HMGA2.32-34 Furthermore, contrary to common reports that TP53Mut leads to accumulation of p53
1020

protein, we found low p53 expression in these samples
(Fig. 2).
In line with previous reports,2,5,29 we found
TP53Mut in only 22% of tumors and 39% of cell lines,
with no codon preference. Fourteen of the mutations have
not been previously reported in sarcoma. LS had only 6%
TP53Mut. Thus, drug strategies that activate wild-type
p53 may have potential in sarcomas, in particular
liposarcomas.24,35
Twenty percent of the patient samples had more
than 5-fold amplification of MDM2, and significantly
more in LS, primarily WDLS, confirming previous
reports.36,37 Furthermore, MDM4Ampl was found exclusively in the LS patient samples, strongly associated with
MDM2Ampl, indicating that these aberrations are not
mutually exclusive, and suggesting that therapeutic strategies that target both MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX)
may be particularly promising in LS patients.
Normal variation in the TP53 and MDM2 genes
has also been reported to affect tumor properties.11,38 The
presence of SNP309G in the promoter may increase
MDM2 expression.39 However, no overall enrichment of
SNP309G was observed in this tumor material compared
with that from healthy Norwegians, arguing against any
predisposing effect,21 and no clear association between

MDM2 expression level and SNP309 was found in this
panel. The latter point is perhaps not surprising, because
MDM2 expression is highly associated with gain or gene
amplification, and there was no tendency for specific alleles to be overrepresented in tumors with altered MDM2
copy number.
As shown here, most published studies conclude
that mutant TP53 is associated with poor outcome.40
Similar to loss of p53 function, overexpression of MDM2
could be a poor prognostic indicator, although published
conclusions differ (reviewed in Onel and CordonCardo41). We found association of low MDM2 (messenger RNA) expression with shorter DSS and TTP. It
should be noted that MDM2 messenger RNA may not
correlate with MDM2 protein,42 and also there are multiple splice variants complicating the interpretation of either. However, the relation to survival could not be
verified in multivariate analysis, probably due to the
strong influence of WDLS with high MDM2, but it is
also noteworthy that low MDM2 level is associated with
TP53Mut.
Presence of TP53 R72 has been associated with better induction of apoptosis.14 However, excluding LS, P72
was less frequent in this tumor material than in healthy
Norwegians (30% versus 58%20), contradicting a protective role of R72. Interestingly, we found a tendency toward longer TTP after chemotherapy for patients with the
R72 variant, as previously reported for squamous carcinomas.16 Subsequent subgroup analysis revealed that
patients with R72 respond significantly better to doxorubicin/ifosfamide combination regimens than do those
patients with the P72 variant. Although the number of
patients was limited, the association was significant in
multivariate analysis. The reduced chemotherapy
response often observed in LS could be associated with
lower prevalence of R72.
In addition, TP53Mut combined with R72 has previously been shown to reduce apoptosis after chemotherapy,43 because specific p53 mutants are capable of
inhibiting p73, another possible mediator of cytotoxicity.
In this series, the number of samples was too small to conclude, but patients with P72/TP53Mut showed longer
TTP than their equivalent (R72/TP53Mut).
Finally, an important objective of this study was to
investigate if TP53 or MDM2 polymorphism could modify sensitivity to MDM2 antagonists. In our hands, all cell
lines with MDM2Ampl responded well to MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a, as long as TP53 was wild-type. Interestingly, one cell line (U2OS) only having MDM2Gain, but
SNP309TG, also had satisfactory drug-response. In conCancer

March 1, 2013

trast, the TP53Wt OS cell line KPD was not sensitive to
Nutlin-3a, despite being homozygous for the variant allele
(SNP309GG). This did not appear to be due to inactivation by MDM4, as reported,44 because the MDM4
expression level was normal. However, TP53 expression
level was very low. Recently, Knappskog et al reported
that other SNPs (eg, SNP285 in breast and ovarian
tumors) may interact with SNP309 and modulate the
MDM2 phenotype.21 Thus, extended genotype examination may be necessary to guide future p53-activation
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
Patients with TP53 wild-type sarcomas and the R72 variant had improved survival and response to chemotherapy.
If TP53 is mutated, presence of R72 may have the opposite effect. MDM2 overexpression predicts good response
to MDM2 antagonists such as Nutlin-3a, but intact p53
pathway is essential. Detailed analysis of aberrations in the
p53 pathways may help to predict tumor sensitivity and
resistance to p53 activating therapy by MDM2
antagonists
