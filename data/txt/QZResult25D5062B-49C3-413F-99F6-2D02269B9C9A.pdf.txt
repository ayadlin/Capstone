ABSTRACT
Targeting cancer stem cell (CSC) represents a promising therapeutic approach
as it can potentially fight cancer at its root. The challenge is to identify a surface
therapeutic oncotarget on CSC. Tissue factor (TF) is known as a common yet specific
surface target for cancer cells and tumor neovasculature in several solid cancers.
However, it is unknown if TF is expressed by CSCs. Here we demonstrate that TF is
constitutively expressed on CD133 positive (CD133+) or CD24-CD44+ CSCs isolated
from human cancer cell lines, tumor xenografts from mice and breast tumor tissues
from patients. TF-targeted agents, i.e., a factor VII (fVII)-conjugated photosensitizer
(fVII-PS for targeted photodynamic therapy) and fVII-IgG1Fc (Immunoconjugate
or ICON for immunotherapy), can eradicate CSC via the induction of apoptosis
and necrosis and via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complementdependent cytotoxicity, respectively. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that
TF is a novel surface therapeutic oncotarget for CSC, in addition to cancer cell TF and
tumor angiogenic vascular endothelial TF. Moreover, this research highlights that
TF-targeting therapeutics can effectively eradicate CSCs, without drug resistance,
isolated from breast, lung and ovarian cancer with potential to translate into other
most commonly diagnosed solid cancer, in which TF is also highly expressed.

metastasis [3, 4, 6]. There is a need to develop therapies
that can specifically target and eradicate CSC, so that
cancer can be treated at its earliest stages. The challenge is
to identify selective surface therapeutic targets for CSCs.
Tissue factor (TF) is a 47-kDa membrane-bound cell
surface receptor [7–9] and can initiate blood coagulation
upon disruption of vessel wall integrity [10, 11]. TF is a
common yet specific biomarker for cancer cells and tumor
vascular endothelial cells in solid cancers [12–15]. Using
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced in
vitro angiogenic vascular endothelial models, we showed

INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a small subpopulation
of neoplastic cells within a tumor that theoretically
possess the capacity to self-renew and develop into the
heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the
tumor [1]. The CSC hypothesis not only offers a model of
tumorigenesis, but also helps explain tumor heterogeneity,
recurrence and resistance to therapeutic agents [1–3].
Recent reports suggest that CSC may contribute to tumor
angiogenesis, resistance to multiple therapies [4, 5] and

that TF is an angiogenic-specific receptor and the target
for factor VII-targeted therapeutics [16]. It is unknown if
TF is consistently expressed by CSC. We hypothesize that
TF can serve as a novel biomarker for CSC and propose
that targeting TF represents a novel therapeutic approach
for the eradication of CSC.
To target TF-expressing angiogenic vascular
endothelial cells (VEC) and cancer cells, Dr. Garen and
Dr. Hu co-invented and developed two therapeutics
using fVII, the natural ligand for TF, as the targeting
domain in the context of immunotherapy [13, 14, 17]
and photodynamic therapy (PDT) [15, 18–20]. For TFtargeted immunotherapy, Hu et al. constructed an immunoconjugate of active site-mutated fVII and human IgG1 Fc
(fVII-IgG1Fc), called ICON [13, 14, 17]. Intra-lesional
ICON immunotherapy of experimental melanoma,
prostate and head and neck tumors leads to marked
tumor inhibition, and in some cases, complete eradication
without affecting normal tissues [13, 14, 17, 21]. Upon
binding to TF-expressing cancer cells, ICON can mediate
natural killer cell (NK) cell dependent antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytototoxicity (ADCC) and complementdependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as its mechanism of
action [21]. For TF-targeted PDT, Hu et al. conjugated a
monomeric fVII peptide with the photosensitizers (PS)
verteporfin (VP) and Sn(IV) chlorin e6 (SnCe6) (referred
to as fVII-VP and fVII-SnCe6, respectively) and showed
that fVII-targeted PDT could selectively and effectively
kill angiogenic vascular endothelial cells and cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo in mouse models of human breast
[18–20] and lung cancer [15].
To test our central hypothesis in the clinical realm,
we assessed the impact of the CSC-killer drugs on putative
stem cells isolated from cancer cell lines, tumor xenografts
from mice as well as from human tumors of various types,
including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), lung
cancer and ovarian cancer. TF is highly expressed in these
cancer cells (80%-100% in breast cancer, 40%-80% in
lung cancer and 84% in ovarian cancer) [15]. These three
types of cancer are not only difficult to control, but also
are major causes of mortality in the United States and
worldwide and often develop CSC-based resistance to
chemotherapy and radiation therapy [22–24]. Our marker
for isolation of CSC was CD133 (AC133), which has been
confirmed as a cancer stem cell marker [1, 2] in cancer of
the brain, colon, breast, lung, ovaries, head and neck and
pancreas. The CSC marker CD133 has been reported to
co-express with another CSC marker, CD44, in ovarian
cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [25, 26]. So their
expression of TF and CD44 were also examined. Their
tumor initiating ability was verified by a tumorsphere
assay in vitro and by tumor xenograft assay in vivo in
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice [1].
Finally the efficacy and mechanism of action of ICON and
fVII-tPDT were tested in vitro for the eradication of CSCs
with comparisons to non-CSC cancer cells.

TF is expressed by CD133+ CSCs isolated from
human cancer lines, tumor xenografts and
patients’ tumor tissues
To obtain putative stem cells for identification of
novel CSC biomarkers, CD133+ cancer cells were isolated
from various human tumor cell lines, including MDAMB-231 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), H460
and A549 (lung cancer), OVCAR-5 and HEY (ovarian
cancer), from subcutaneous human lung tumor xenografts
established in immunodeficient mice and from surgically
resected primary breast tumor tissues from six patients.
The results in Supplementary Table S1 verified that
CD133+ CSCs represent a small population in cultured
cancer cell lines (0.1% to 2%), tumor xenografts (0.5%
for H460 and A549, 3% for MDA-MB-231) and tumor
tissues from patients with breast cancer (3.82%). These
isolated CD133+ cancer cells were further verified that
they were tumor initiating stem cells, i.e., CSCs, by in
vitro tumorsphere assays in 96 well micro-plates and by in
vivo tumor xenograft assays in SCID/Beige mice.
The results of in vitro tumorsphere assays
demonstrated that CD133+ cancer cells formed
significantly more (p values <0.05 or less for CD133+ vs.
CD133-) (Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary
Table S2) and larger (Supplementary Figure S2)
tumorspheres than CD133- cancer cells did. We also
tested whether the isolation protocol and the medium in
the sphere assays would cause variations of sphere size
and/or number. The results (Supplementary Figure S1-S2
and Supplementary Table S2) showed that there were no
significant differences in tumorsphere numbers between
two CD133 antibody-based isolation protocols (EasySep
vs. MACS) and between two tumorsphere assay media
(FBS-containing growth medium vs. serum-free stem cell
medium) (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary
Figure S1).
The in vivo tumor xenograft assays showed that
even 100 or 200 CD133+ H460 cancer cells could form
significantly larger tumors that were detectable earlier
than those CD133- H460 cells (results with 200 cells
reported in Supplementary Figure S3; results with 100,
500 and 1000 cell groups reported in Supplementary
Figure S4). Supplementary Figure S3a showed that 200
CD133+ H460 cells formed tumors with an average size
of 60 mm3 on day 17, whereas CD133- cells took almost
twice as long (31 days) to form the same size tumor (60
mm3) (p<0.0001 from day 17 through day 38). The sizes
and weights of tumors formed by CD133+ cancer cells
were also greater than those from CD133- cancer cells
in the same mouse groups, as observed morphologically
(Supplementary Figure S3b and S3c) and quantitatively

0.15 grams, p=0.0302) (Supplementary Figure S3d).
Having verified that CD133+ cancer cells are CSCs,
we examined expression of TF and/or CD44 on CD133+
CSCs isolated from the human cancer lines, tumor
xenografts and patients’ tumor tissues to identify new
biomarkers for CSCs. Figure 1 shows co-expression of TF
and CD44 in CD133+ cancer cells isolated from the human
lung cancer line H460, i.e., CD133+ cells from H460
line co-express TF (Figure 1a) and CD44 (Figure 1c),
whereas CD133- cells express only TF (Figure 1b and
1d). Similarly, Figure 2 shows co-expression of TF and
CSC markers (CD133 and CD44) in CD133+ H460 cells

(Figure 2a and 2c) isolated from human tumor xenografts
grown in mice, whereas CD133- cancer cells express only
TF, but no CD44 and CD133 (Figure 2b and 2d). Figure 3
shows that CD133+ cancer cells, either from the ovarian
cancer line OVCAR-5 (Figure 3a), TNBC MDA-MB-231
line (Figure 3b), or from breast cancer patients (Figure 3c),
all express TF. CD133- breast cancer cells from in vitro
cultured line (Figure 3b) and from patients (Figure 3c) also
express TF. In summary, both the CD133+ and CD133cancer cells express TF, either isolated from cancer cell
lines, tumor xenografts or from patients’ tumor tissues.
To further validate TF expression on CSCs, we also
used a CD44-based human CD24 negative CD44 positive

also positive for expression of CD133 and TF, whereas
non-CSC CD24- cancer cells were negative for express of
CD133 (not shown).

towards eradicating CSC-based tumors by TF-targeted
PDT using fVII-conjugated SnCe6, we examined the
effectiveness of fVII-tPDT for killing CD133+ TF+ CSCs
in vitro in this study. Figure 4 shows that fVII-tPDT
effectively eradicated CD133+ H460 CSCs (Figure 4a)
and A549 CSCs (Figure 4b) isolated from lung tumor
xenografts. The doses of fVII-SnCe6 conjugate and laser
energy tested for CSCs were based on our published data
on the parental H460 and A549 cancer lines [15]. With
1 μM SnCe6 and 36 J/cm2 laser energy, fVII-tPDT was
able to completely eradicate CD133+ H460 and A549
CSCs (0% survival), whereas the survival of CD133non-CSC H460 and A549 cancer cells was 0.3% (p<0.001
for CD133+ vs. CD133- H460, Supplementary Table S3).
When increasing SnC6 to 2 μM, fVII-tPDT was able to

completely eradicate CD133+ CSCs, CD133- non-CSCs
and parental H460 and A549 lung cancer cells (Figure 4a
and 4b and Supplementary Table S3). We have previously
shown that fVII-PS alone and laser light alone did not
have effects in killing cancer cells [20]. FVII-targeting
significantly improved not only the effectiveness and but
also the selectivity of non-targeted PDT effect in killing
lung and breast cancer cells and angiogneic vascular
endothelial cells in vitro [15, 20], all of which expressed
TF. In contrast, fVII-tPDT had no effect on TF-negative
normal cell controls, including 293 [20], CHO-K1
[21] and unstimulated HUVEC (a model of quiescent
endothelial cell control) [20, 21]. Moreover, it was verified
that the effect of fVII-tPDT was mediated by fVII binding
to TF [20]. Thus we believe that eradication of CSCs by
fVII-tPDT was mediated specifically via TF targeting.
To compare the effectiveness of fVII-tPDT for
killing parental, CD133+ CSC and CD133- cancer cells,
half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of SnCe6
were determined using One-phase decay (Prism software).
Figure 4a showed that, with laser energy at 36 J/cm2, EC50s
of SnCe6 in fVII-SnCe6 conjugate were 0.19 μM, 0.30
μM and 0.26 μM for CD133+ CSCs, CD133- non-CSCs
and parental H460 cancer cells, respectively. Similarly,
EC50s of SnCe6 in fVII-tPDT for CD133+ CSCs, CD133non-CSCs and parental A549 cancer cells were 0.25 μM,
0.60 μM and 0.26 μM, respectively (Figure 4b). The EC50s
for CD133- and parental A549 cells are similar to the
published data for the same cancer line [15]. Statistical
analyses showed that CD133+ CSCs was significantly
more sensitive to fVII-tPDT than CD133- non-CSC
cancer cells (p values <0.01 or less) (Figure 4a and 4b,
Supplementary Table S3), suggesting that CSCs are
actually more sensitive to fVII-tPDT treatment than nonCSC cancer cells.
TF-targeted PDT was also effective in killing human
ovarian CSCs. The CSCs from OVCAR5 (Supplementary
Figure S5a) and HEY cells (Supplementary Figure S5b)
were more sensitive to fVII-tPDT (2 μM SnCe6 in fVIISnCe6 and 36 J/cm2) than CD133- non-CSC cancer cells
(p=0.0107 and p=0.0437, respectively). It is worth noting
that fVII-tPDT was able to completely eradicate CSC from
ovarian cancer cells. To verify that those CSC had been
killed after fVII-tPDT treatment, we carried out both the
clonogenic assay and the crystal violet staining assay for
determining the effect of fVII-tPDT. Supplementary Table
S4 showed that after fVII-tPDT treatment (2 μM SnCe6
in fVII-SnCe6 and 36 J/cm2), both the CD133+ CSCs
and CD133- cancer cells were completely eradicated (0%
survival) as determined by the clonogenic assay, whereas
the membrane-staining assay, due to its limitations
that crystal violet would stain any cellular membrane,
either viable cells or cell debris (see Figure 4e–4f and
Supplementary Figure S6), so that the membrane staining
assay showed that the survival % of CD133+ CSCs
was ~31% and CD133- H460 was ~40% (p=0.0171).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Taken together, these results suggest that fVII-tPDT can
completely eradicate CD133+ CSCs and CD133- nonCSC cancer cells without drug resistance.
To elucidate the mechanism of action of fVIItPDT in killing CD133+ CSCs, we stained the CSC for
evidence of apoptosis and necrosis immediately after fVIItPDT treatment. Figure 4c shows that fVII-tPDT induced
apoptosis (Annexin-V/FITC stained membrane) and
necrosis (PI stained nuclei) in CD133+ H460 CSCs. Under
bright field, it is obvious that the membrane integrity of
H460 CSCs was damaged due to the fVII-tPDT treatment
(Figure 4c), whereas untreated CSC control cells showed
no signs of apoptosis or necrosis (Figure 4d). The
observation about CSC was similar to those in CD133- and
parental H460 cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S5c).
Crystal violet staining assay further verified the cellular
destruction of OVCAR5 CSCs by fVII-tPDT (Figure 4e),
whereas untreated control cells were intact and confluent
(Figure 4f). The observations on CSC cellular destruction
by fVII-tPDT were repeatedly observed in CSCs from
lung cancer A549 (Supplementary Figure S6) and H460
(not shown) and were consistent with our observations in
the H460 cancer cells [15].

ICON effectively kills CSCs via antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
In addition to testing TF-targeted fVII-tPDT for
eradicating CSCs, we tested another TF-targeted agent,
namely ICON (fVII-IgG1Fc), for killing CSC via CD16+
effector cell- and complement-mediated immunotherapy.
Figure 5 shows that ICON was effective in killing CSCs
via ADCC and CDC. ICON could augment CD16+ effector
cell-mediated ADCC to kill CD133+ CSCs and CD133non-CSC H460 lung cancer cells (no significant difference
between CD133+ and CD133- cells) (Figure 5a), whereas
human IgG control antibody showed no ADCC effect on
those cancer cells (p<0.001 between ICON and IgG control).
ICON could also activate complement to kill CD133+
CSCs, CD133- and parental H460 cancer cells (Figure 5b).
To verify that ICON-mediated ADCC is also
effective in killing CD24-CD44+ CSCs isolated from
the CD24 and CD44-based CSC isolation protocol, we
compared the effect of ICON-mediated ADCC assay in
killing CD24-CD44+ and CD133+ CSCs isolated from
the TNBC MDA-MB-231 line and breast cancer CSCs
isolated from patients. Figure 5c and 5d shows evidence
that ICON was equally effective in killing CSCs and
non-CSC breast cancer cells, using either CD24 CD44
antibodies-based protocol (R&D) (Figure 5c) or CD133
antibody-based protocol (StemCell) (Figure 5d). Figure 5e
shows that ICON was equally effective in killing CD133+
CSCs and CD133- non-CSC breast cancer cells isolated
from surgically dissected primary tumor tissues from
patients, while IgG isotype negative control showed no

contact with circulating fVII and TF-targeting agents at
these sites by the semipermeable normal blood vessels
[29]. In contrast, newly formed tumor blood vessels
are leaky because they lack tight junctions between
endothelial cells, and their walls may even lack endothelial
cells entirely [30, 31]. Thus, only the TF on CSCs,
angiogenic VECs and cancer cells is accessible to TFtargeting therapeutic agents via leaky tumor blood vessels.
The finding that TF-targeted therapies are able
to eradicate CSCs, in addition to their direct effects on
cancer cells and tumor vessels, may help explain the
marked in vivo efficacy of ICON and fVII-tPDT, which
can eradicate established tumor xenografts (100-500
mm3) and prevent recurrence in preclinical mouse models
of human prostate [14], melanoma [17], tongue [21] and
lung [15] cancer. With respect to the levels required for
complete tumor ablation, our previous murine studies
showed that 50-100 ng/ml of plasma ICON levels in
blood circulation was effective in eradication of distant
metastasis after intratumoral injections of ICON-encoding
adenoviral vectors [14]. In order to determine the optimal
ICON concentration for humans, Phase I testing is
needed. Delivery of ICON to the tumor target can be
achieved by several means such as direct injection into
tumors of ICON-encoded viral vectors [14, 17, 21] or i.v.
administration of ICON protein [14]. These approaches
have been detailed in previous publications [14, 17, 21,
32]. Regarding possible side effects, we have shown that
ICON administration has minimal side effects in multiple
animal models [13, 14, 17, 21]. Overall, the side effects
of PDT using non-targeted photosensitizing agents are
well described and manageable. Photosensitizing agents
directed at TF would be expected to localize specifically
to tumor cells and tumor vasculature. As has been shown
in mouse models, TF-targeting with fVII-conjugated
photosensitizers has the potential to significantly improve
the selectivity and efficacy of PDT for the treatment of
breast and lung cancer [15, 18–20]. On the other hand,
this also makes it difficult to test the in vivo efficacy of
TF-targeted therapies as a result of only eradicating
CSCs alone, due to the observations that TF is expressed
additionally on cancer cells and/or tumor vasculature
in vivo in animal tumor models [13, 15]. Nevertheless,
a newly developed cancer stem cell reporter vector
system by the Wakefield group at NCI [33] may allow
us to selectively label CSCs in vitro and in vivo in tumor
xenografts and then to specifically examine in vivo
evidence of the efficacy of TF-targeting therapies for
eradication of CSCs in our ongoing studies using tumor
cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft mouse
models.
To our knowledge, this study identifies for the
first time that TF is a novel CSC therapeutic target and
demonstrates that TF-targeted therapeutics (ICON and
fVII-tPDT) can completely eradicate CSCs without drug
resistance. In fact, our results indicate that CSCs are more

effect in killing any cancer cells (p value not significant
for CSCs vs. non-CSCs; p<0.0001 between ICON and IgG
isotpye control for CSCs and non-CSCs).

DISCUSSION
Dr. Wicha’s group has elegantly summarized and
proposed to target CSC via CSC surface markers, such
as ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase), CD44, CD133
and HER2, or the CSC niche, such as tumor associated
macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, using
immunologic approaches [27]. In this study, we identified
TF, a membrane-bound receptor that is different from
those previously known CSC targets, as a novel surface
therapeutic target for CSCs. We confirmed that CD133+
CSCs were presented in small percentages in several
cancer cell lines cultured in vitro, mouse tumor xenografts
and patients’ tumor tissues. Furthermore, we confirmed
that these CD133+ cancer cells were CSCs, which coexpress TF and CD44. TF-targeting therapeutics, fVIItPDT and ICON, could eradicate CSCs via induction
of apoptosis and necrosis and via ADCC and CDC,
respectively. These findings are consistent with our
previous findings of the mechanisms of action for fVIItPDT [15] and ICON [21] to kill cancer cells. When we
initiated this project in 2008, CD133 was the major surface
biomarker along with other commonly used markers such
as CD44 for isolating CSCs [1]. Given that the CSC field
evolved in the course of this study, CD24- and CD44based protocols were used to validate the CD133-based
protocols in the current work for isolation of breast
CSCs. An earlier study showed that TF was expressed
by CD133+ cancer cells that were isolated from a highly
tumorigenic squamous cell carcinoma cell line A431 [28].
However, that earlier study did not include studies to ask
whether those CD133+ A431 cells were cancer initiating
stem cells, a characteristic that could be verified by
tumorsphere assays in vitro and by a tumorigenesis assay
in vivo [1]. Nonetheless, it provides independent evidence
for TF expression in CD133+ cancer cells from a different
cancer line.
An ideal surface target molecule for CSCs ought
to be expressed selectively on CSCs, but not on normal
cells, or even on some normal cells, these normal cells
should be located outside of blood vessels and thus will
be sequestered from direct contact with systemically
administered therapeutic agents. We believe TF is such
an ideal surface target for CSCs. Based on its selective
expression and the leakiness of tumor neovasculature
along with the findings in this study, we believe that TF is a
common yet specific biomarker and therapeutic target not
only for cancer cells and angiogenic vascular endothelial
cells, but also for CSCs in tumor microenvironment.
Although TF is expressed on extravascular cells and
in the adventitial layer of the blood vessel wall under
physiological conditions, it is sequestered from direct

sensitive than non-CSC cancer cells, to TF-targeting
therapies. These findings may translate into other most
commonly diagnosed solid cancer. This is because,
similar to the cancer of breast, lung and ovary, TF is also
expressed at high percentages in many other human solid
cancers [15], for instance, 95% in primary melanoma and
100% in metastatic melanoma, 53%-90% in pancreatic
cancer, 57%-100% in colorectal cancer, 63%-100% in
hepatocellular carcinoma, 60%-78% in primary and
metastatic prostate cancer and 47%-75% in glioma. Since
CSCs represent a small population of malignant cells
in a tumor tissue, targeting CSC alone therapy may not
completely eradicate the established tumors. In this regard,
TF-targeted therapeutics with ability to target three major
tumor compartments, i.e., CSCs, cancer cells and tumor
neovasculature, may achieve better efficacy and clinical
outcome for cancer patients than those that only target
CSCs, cancer cells or tumor angiogenesis/neovasculature
alone.

were labeled with CD133/1 microbeads in the CD133 cell
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) by gently agitating for 30
min at 4°C. The single cell suspension was separated using
a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotech). The uncoated cells
(CD133- cells) were removed by several washes with
PBS/BSA (1× PBS pH7.4 free of Ca2+ and Mg2+, 1mM
EDTA and 2% heat-inactivated FBS). The retained cells
were designated CD133+ cancer cells.
We established the EasySep procedure for isolating
CD133+ CSCs by modifying StemCell PE selection kit
(StemCell Technologies) with PE-anti-CD133 antibody.
After non-enzymatic dissociation, cancer cell suspension
was incubated with PE-conjugated anti-human CD133/1
antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) at a concentration of 0.33μg/ml, were then incubated with EasySep PE Selection
Cocktail and magnetic nanoparticles. Finally the cell
suspensions were separated by magnet means. The
uncoated cells (CD133- cells) were removed by four
washes with PBS/FBS. The retained cells were designated
CD133+ cancer cells.
When isolating CSC from tumor xenografts and
tumor tissues from breast cancer patients, the tumor tissues
were minced into small pieces (1-2 mm), washed twice
in HBSS and then dissociated in HBSS with 1 mg/ml
Collagenase IV (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C with rotation.
The dissociated cell suspension was filtered through a 70mesh filter (Sigma). The cell suspension was washed in
PBS and then processed for isolation of CD133+ cancer
cells using the EasySep PE selection procedure or the
MACS procedure, as described above. Note that isolation
of cancer stem cells from surgically dissected tumor
tissues from cancer patients has been approved by OSU
IRB committee with patients’ consent.
The protocol for isolating CD24-CD44+ CSCs was
the same as suggested by the manufacturer using the CD24
CD44 breast cancer stem cell isolation kit (R&D) with a
modification of using the EasSep magnet. The resulting
three cell populations were termed CD24-CD44+ (CSCs),
CD24-CD44- (non-CSCs) and CD24+ (non-CSCs) cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell lines
Human lung cancer cell lines (H460 and A549)
were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen), human ovarian
cancer lines (OVCAR5 and HEY) were cultured in F12
(Invitrogen), and the human triple negative breast cancer
line (MDA-MB-231) was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen),
all supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Patient-derived breast
cancer cells and ADCC bioassay effector cells (a T cellderived leukemia cell line Jurkat transfected with Fc
receptor CD16 and NFAT-Luciferase under the control of
CD16 binding followed by NFAT activation) (Promega)
were cultured in RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine and
HEPES (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. The medium for ADCC effector cells was
additionally supplemented with 250 μg/ml Antibiotic
G-418 Sulfate Solution (Invitrogen) and 100μg/ml
hygromycin (Invitrogen).

Immunostaining and immunoblot analysis
After isolation, the CD133+ and CD133- cancer
cells from the same parental cancer line were evaluated for
expression of TF, CD133 and CD44 by immunofluorescent
staining. Briefly, equal numbers (1 × 104) of CD133+ and
CD133-H460 cells were grown on the sterile 8-chamber
slides for 48 hr, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
minutes at room temperature. All slides were incubated
with primary anti-human TF antibody (Clone HTF1,
kind gift of Professor William Konigsberg), followed
by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). Then slides
were incubated using PE-conjugated anti-human CD133/2
antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) or PE-conjugated anti-human
CD44 antibody (BD Biosciences). Finally, the nuclei

Isolation of CD133+ CSCs from human cancer
lines, tumor xenografts from mice and breast
tumor tissues from patients
Using published procedures [34–36] [37–45] [28,
46–50] with modifications, CD133+ CSCs in this study
were separately isolated using anti-CD133/1 (AC133)
PE conjugate MACS microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotech)
and EasySep PE positive selection kit (StemCell
Technologies). For the MACS procedure, cancer cells
were dissociated in non-enzymatic solution (Sigma) and

were counterstained with DAPI (Dilactate, Molecular
Probes). Representative images were photographed using
a LSM510 NLO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss).
For immunoblotting, the isolated CD133+ and
CD133- cancer cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Santa
Cruz Biotech) and were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE.
The protein samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose
(NC) membrane using Turbo Transfer unit (Bio-Rad).
After blocking in 5% non-fat milk blocker (Bio-Rad), the
NC membrane was incubated with 0.5 μg/ml monoclonal
antibody against human TF (HTF1) followed by HRP
conjugated a secondary antibody against mouse IgG
(1:10,000, 1mg/ml stock, Vector Laboratories) and then
with ECL reagents (Pierce) and exposure to film. After the
first probing for TF, the NC membrane was incubated in
Western stripping buffer (Pierce) to sequentially re-probe
with anti-CD133/1 antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) (0.5 μg/
ml stock, 2nd probing) for CD133 followed by anti-mouse
IgGFc HRP conjugate (Vector Laboratories) and then
with anti-GAPDH HRP (1:5000) (Novus Biologicals) for
assessing sample loading.

A recombinant protein consisting of murine factor
VII (mfVII) with a K341A mutation followed by two short
amino acid tags, S peptide with D14N mutation (S tag) and
6x Histidine tag (His tag) in the C-terminus was produced
using recombinant DNA technique, as described [15,
20]. After affinity purification using Ni-NTA (Qiagen),
fVII protein was characterized and conjugated to Sn(IV)
Chlorin e6 dye (Frontier Scientific) by using a cross linker
EDC (Pierce). After size exclusion separation of fVII
conjugated dye from free dye, fVII-SnCe6 conjugate was
verified for binding activity to cancer cells by ELISA and
then was used for fVII-tPDT below.

fVII-tPDT for CD133+ and CD133- cancer cells
in vitro and crystal violet membrane staining and
clonogenic assays
The procedure of fVII-tPDT in vitro using fVIISnCe6 conjugate was described in detail [15, 20]. Briefly,
1 × 104 cells of CD133+ CSCs, CD133- and parental
cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plate overnight,
washed once with 1X HBSS containing 1% BSA,
incubated with fVII-SnCe6 in 1X HBSS containing
1% BSA and 10 mM CaCl2, or the buffer only as nontreatment control, for 90 minutes as optimized drug light
interval [20]. The cells were irradiated with 635 nm fiber
delivery diode laser with adjustable power (0-250 mW/
cm2, B & W Tek, Inc) at different energy. The PDT effect
was determined by the monolayer cell membrane staining
with crystal violet and by a clonogenic assay, as described
[15, 20, 52]. The therapeutic effect was presented as cell
survival percentage (%) based on OD595 nm using the
formula: cell survival percentage (%)=(PDT treatedmaximal killing control)/(untreatment control-maximal
killing control) × 100%. In the conventional clonogenic
assay, the colony numbers were counted by staining the
colonies with crystal violet and the cell survival %= PDT
treated/untreated control × 100%.

Tumorsphere assay in vitro in matrigel
microplates
The tumorsphere assay was done as described
[39]. Briefly, 96-well plates were pre-coated with 50 μl
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) per well, then CD133+ and
CD133- cancer cells were suspended in growth medium
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) or MammocultTM
Basal medium (Stemcell Technologies) and seeded upon
Matrigel at the density of 100, 50, 25 or 12.5 cells per well.
All experiments were conducted in triplicate wells. The
numbers of colony were counted at week 1, 2 and 3. The
data were presented as mean ± SEM and representative
views were photographed.

In vivo tumorigenicity of CD133+ and CD133cancer cells in mice
The in vivo tumorigenicity of isolated CD133+
and CD133- cancer cells was assessed and compared as
formation of tumors in severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice. After isolation, the CD133+ or CD133cancer cells were mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) and 50 μl of cancer cells/Matrigel
mixture containing 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 CD133+ or
CD133- lung cancer cells were subcutaneously injected
into right and left flanks of 3 weeks male SCID/Beige
mice (Taconic Farms). The tumor volume was calculated
by measuring tumor width and length in millimeters (mm)
with calipers twice a week from day 0 to day 38 and using
tumor volume (mm3)=(width)2 × length/2, as described
[13, 14, 17, 51]. Photographs of mice and tumors were
taken during and at the time of sacrifice of the mice. At
the end of experiments, CD133+ and CD133- cancer cellderived tumors were dissected and weighed separately.

Assays for apoptosis and necrosis
After CD133+ CSCs and non-CSCs were treated
by fVII-tPDT, markers for apoptosis and necrosis
were assayed using ApoDETECT Annexin V-FITC
kit (Invitrogen), in which Annexin V FITC staining for
apoptosis and propidium iodide staining DNA for necrosis,
as described [15].

ICON-mediated ADCC assay
ICON-mediated ADCC to CSCs and non-CSCs was
determined using an ADCC effector assay (Promega) [53]
following the manufacturer’s instruction with a critical
modification to the assay medium by using DMEM
medium supplemented with 0.5% super low IgG FBS

(HyClone), instead of RPMI 1640. The reason is that
DMEM medium contains relatively a higher calcium
concentration (1.8 mM) than RMPI 1640 (0.42 mM)
according to the information on calcium in cell culture
from Sigma-Aldrich. Calcium is required for ICON and
fVII binding to its receptor TF [13]. Briefly, CSCs and
non-CSC cancer cells (4 × 103 or 1 × 104 cells per well)
were seeded in duplicate into the 60 inner wells and grown
overnight in 96-well white assay plate (Corning) at 37°C
and 5% CO2. The next morning ICON protein at serial
dilutions was added in duplicate wells to CSCs and nonCSC cancer cells, whereas human IgG (Sigma) was used
as IgG isotype control. After 15 min incubation at 37°C,
ADCC effector cells were added to achieve a ration of
effector to target (E:T) at 25:1. At the end of 6-hr or 19hr incubation, equal volume of Bio-Glo assay reagent
(Promega) was added and raw bioluminescence (RLU)
was read on SpectraMax i3 (Molecular Devices) every 5
min for 30 min and analyzed by Prism software.

ICON-mediated CDC assay
ICON-CDC to CD133+ CSCs and CD133- nonCSCs was determined by a fluorescent dye Calcein AM
release assay, as described [21]. Briefly, the CD133+
CSCs and non-CSC CD133- cells were seeded in 96well U-bottom microplates overnight. The next morning
the cells were labeled with 4 μM Calcein AM (Molecular
Probes) for 40 min and then the cells were incubated
with ICON diluted in 1× VBS buffer supplemented with
10mM CaCl2 and followed by incubation with 1:4 diluted
rabbit complement MA (Cedarlane Laboratories) as a
source of complements. Controls include ICON alone
and complement alone, buffer alone (as spontaneous
release control) and maximal release control (0.1% Triton
X-100 lysis). After 4-hr incubation, the plate was briefly
centrifuged and supernatant was transferred to a new 96well black plate with clear, flat bottom. Fluorescence in
supernatants was read on a fluorescence microplate reader
(Molecular Devices). CDC cytotoxicity was calculated as
described [21].

Statistical analysis

Authorsʼ contributions

All the data in vitro and in vivo are presented as
mean ± SEM and analyzed for statistical significance
using SAS 9.4 software. Linear mixed effects models
and t-tests were performed for comparing CD133+ and
CD133- groups. Multiple comparisons were adjusted
by Holm’s method where appropriate. For analyses of
statistical significance triplicate or quadruplicate wells in
each group were used for tumorsphere assays in vitro in
tissue culture plates and 3 mice per group were used in
vivo in animal studies. The significance of tumorigenicity
between CD133+ CSCs and non-CSC CD133- cancer
cells was determined by comparing their tumor volumes
side by side in the same mice (3 mice per group) using
