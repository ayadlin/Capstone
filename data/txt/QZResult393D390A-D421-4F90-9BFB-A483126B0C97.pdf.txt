Abstract
Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands may be a valuable tool to promote antitumor responses by reinforcing
antitumor immunity. In addition to their expression in immune cells, functional TLRs are also expressed by many
cancer cells, but their signiﬁcance has been controversial. In this study, we examined the action of TLR ligands on
tumor pathophysiology as a result of direct tumor cell effects. B16 murine melanoma cells were stimulated in vitro
with a TLR4 ligand (LPS-B16) prior to inoculation into TLR4-deﬁcient mice (Tlr4 lps-del). Under such conditions,
B16 cells yielded smaller tumors than nonstimulated B16 cells. The apoptosis/proliferation balance of the cells
was not modiﬁed by TLR ligand treatment, nor was this effect compromised in immunocompromised nude mice.
Mechanistic investigations revealed that IFNb was the critical factor produced by TLR4-activated tumor cells in
mediating their in vivo outgrowth. Transcriptional analysis showed that TLR4 activation on B16 cells induced
changes in the expression of type I IFN and type I IFN-related genes. Most importantly, culture supernatants from
LPS-B16 cells improved the maturation of bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from TLR4-deﬁcient
mice, upregulating the expression of interleukin-12 and costimulatory molecules on those cells. BMDC
maturation was blunted by addition of an IFNb-neutralizing antibody. Moreover, tumor growth inhibition
observed in LPS-B16 tumors was abrogated in IFNAR1-deﬁcient mice lacking a functional type I IFN receptor for
binding IFN. Together, our ﬁndings show that tumor cells can be induced through the TLR4 pathway to produce
IFN and positively contribute to the antitumoral immune response. Cancer Res; 72(3); 592–603. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize molecules derived from
pathogens as well as endogenous danger signals possessing
similar chemical structures (1, 2). Recently, functional TLRs
were found to be expressed in cancer cells, but their signiﬁcance remains controversial (3–12). Whereas most of the
therapeutic strategies using microbial products were designed
with the idea of activating TLRs present on innate immune
system cells (3–10), clear distinction about the separate contribution of immune and cancer cells to the immune response
has yet to be done. Stimulation of TLR4, the main receptor of
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on tumor cells has been

shown to have a positive role in tumorigenesis in in vivo (13–
15), but mainly in in vitro settings (16–19). When tumor
expression of TLR4 or the adaptor molecule MyD88 was
inhibited in tumor cells themselves, opposite conclusions were
observed. This suggests a more complex scenario and that the
consequences of TLR4 triggering on tumor cells could depend
on the type of tumor, the way TLR4 is activated, if such
activation is sustained in time, as it would be in the case of
chronic activation by endogenous ligands or if it is the result of
an acute process (20–24).
Stimulating MAT-LU cells, a rat prostate adenocarcinoma
cell line, with LPS in vitro, before inoculation, produced signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth in Copenhagen rats (24, 25).
The same effect was observed when B16 melanoma cells were
stimulated for 48 hours in vitro with LPS or monophosphoryl
lipid A prior to its inoculation into syngeneic mice. This in vivo
inhibition of tumor growth depends exclusively on TLR4
present on tumor cell themselves and not on antigen-presenting cells from the host, as it was not observed in TLR4-deﬁcient
mice (Tlr4lps-del; ref. 24). When LPS-stimulated B16 or MAT-LU
cells were inoculated into nude mice, the growth of tumors
elicited did not signiﬁcantly differ from tumors induced by
nonstimulated B16 or MAT-LU cells, indicating that the T-cell
compartment was required (24).
These ﬁndings prompted us to determine which molecular
and cellular mechanisms might be involved in this phenomenon. We have identiﬁed IFNb, produced by TLR4-activated

tumor cells as an important mediator of these effects. Our work
brings in a novel aspect to discuss: under speciﬁc conditions
and, probably, at speciﬁc moments of tumor development,
TLR4 triggering on tumor cells could positively help the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells, favoring an antitumoral
immune response.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
LPS from Escherichia coli 055:B5 and non methylated deoxycytidyl-phosphate-deoxyguanosin (CpG) were from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). Ultra-pure LPS from E. coli K12 was
from InvivoGen.
Animals
C57BL/6 mice were from UNLP, Argentina. C57BL/10ScNJ
mice with a deletion of the Tlr4 gene (Tlr4lps-del) were from the
Jackson Laboratories. Il12p40/ mice (26) were provided
by Dr. Silvia Di Genaro (UNSL, Argentina). Ifnar1/ and
Il28r/ mice were provided by Dr. Claude Libert (Ghent
University, Belgium). Animals were maintained at the Animal
Resource Facility of the CIBICI-CONICET in accordance with
the experimental ethics committee guidelines.
Cell lines
Murine B16-F0 melanoma and TRAMPC2 prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and authenticated by isoenzymology and/or the
Cytochrome C subunit I (COI) PCR assay. They were periodically
cultured in our laboratory for the last 10 and 5 years, respectively.
The MB49 bladder cancer cell line was gently provided by Dr. IC
Summerhayes (Lahey Clinic, Burlington, MA) and was used after
5 passages of propagation in supplemented medium. All cell
lines were free of Mycoplasma infection tested by PCR every 6
months. Cells were stimulated in vitro with LPS for 48 hours,
washed exhaustively, and inoculated subcutaneously into
Tlr4lps-del mice. To generate conditioned medium (CM), cells
were kept in 2.5% FBS and stimulated or not with 1 mg/mL
Ultrapure LPS (LPS-B16 CM or B16-CM, respectively). After 48
hours, supernatants were collected.
Generation of DCs
Dendritic cells (DC) were obtained from bone marrow of
Tlr4lps-del mice as described by Inaba and colleagues (27): more
than 80% of harvested cells expressed CD11c. CD11cþ cells (2.5
 105/mL) were incubated with LPS-B16 CM or with B16-CM
and exposed to 10 mg/mL of CpG for 24 hours to analyze
cytokine secretion by ELISA. LPS-B16 CM and B16-CM was
incubated for 1 hour with an IFNb-blocking antibody (4 
102NU/mL; PBL Interferon Source), and then used to stimulate
bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDC).
In vivo tumor challenge
Melanomas were established in C57BL/6, Tlr4lps-del,
Il12p40/, Ifnar1/, and Il28r/ mice by subcutaneous
injection of 1  106 cells into the right ﬂank. Tumor development was monitored every day as described previously (24). To

evaluate the therapeutic activity of LPS, C57BL/6 and Tlr4lps-del
mice were inoculated with 1  106 B16 or 5  105 MB49 cells
and, once tumors reached approximately 5 mm3, they were
treated intratumorally with LPS (1 mg/200 mL) or with 200 mL of
PBS, every other day for 6 consecutive times.
Obtention of tumor-inﬁltrating cells
Tumor-inﬁltrating cells were obtained as previously
described (24).
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
B16 cells (1  106 cells) were stimulated or not with
Ultrapure LPS for 6 and 24 hours. In the case of DCs, they
were previously incubated with LPS-B16 CM or B16-CM for 20
hours prior to the addition of CpG for 4 hours. mRNA expression was analyzed with mouse toll-like receptor signaling
pathway, RT2Proﬁler PCR Array, SABiosciences according to
the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR array was done in ABI
Prism7500 Cycler Detection System. The following primers
were used: IFNb1 Fw50 -TTACACTGCCTTTGCCATCC, Rev50 ACTGTCTGCTGGTGGAGTTCAT; IL-6 Fw50 -GAGGATACCACTCCCAACAGACC-30 , Rev50 -AAGTGCATCATCGTTGTTCATACA-30 ; GAPDH Fw50 -TCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-30 ,
Rev50 -GCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCA-30 . To analyze the data
the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method was used (28).
ELISA
Cytokines were measured by ELISA Kits (e-Biosciences, BDBioscience, and PBL Interferon Source) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. IFNb levels were measured in 5-fold
concentrated tumor supernatants (Vivaspin sample concentrator; GE Healthcare Life Science).
Flow cytometry
Monoclonal antibodies conjugated with their respective
ﬂuorochromes were from BD-Bioscience and e-Biosciences.
Intracellular cytokine was detected after stimulating cells for 5
hours with PMA (10 ng/mL) and Ionomycin (1 mg/mL; SigmaAldrich). Brefeldin A (10 mg/mL; Sigma) was added for the last 4
hours of cell culture. Results were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Statistics
Statistical analysis was done using the Tukey posttest to
ANOVA analysis with the InfoStat software (National University of C
ordoba). Values of P less than 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Triggering TLR4 on B16 cells induces the expression of
important modulators of DC activity
To analyze the expression of genes related to TLR4-mediated signal transduction and effector molecules by a qPCR
array, B16 cells were either nonstimulated or stimulated with
1 mg/mL LPS for 6 and 24 hours. Distinctive TLR4 activation of
downstream genes in B16 cells is shown in the gene expression
heat map in Fig. 1A. Whereas more than a 6-fold induction was

IFNb Produced by TLR4-Activated Tumor Cells

observed for the NFkB mediator genes after 6 hours of stimulation (Nfkb1, Nfkb2, Nfkbia, Nfkbib, RelA, MyD88, and others),
most of the effector molecules were induced after 24 hours
poststimulation (150x IL-6, 6x CCL2, 6x Csf2, 13x TNFa). Interestingly, an important increase in the expression of genes from
the IRF pathway (160x Cxcl10, 11x Irf1), mainly IFN beta (120x)
was observed (Fig. 1A). This upregulation of IFN beta expression levels was conﬁrmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase
PCR using a different set of primers (Fig. 1B). The upregulation
of IFNbeta mRNA expression levels was also observed in 2 other
murine tumor cell lines expressing TLR4: the MB49 and
TRAMPC2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Both cell lines
generated smaller tumors once activated via TLR4, prior to
their in vivo inoculation in Tlr4lps-del and C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). In the case of the TRAMPC2
prostate cancer model, the inhibition of tumor growth
observed was not statistically signiﬁcant, but the incidence
of tumor-bearing animals was lower in the LPS group (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Low levels of secreted IFNb could also be
reliably measured by ELISA in LPS-activated tumor cells (Fig.
1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Interleukin (IL)-6 and TNFa
secreted levels increase with time in LPS-stimulated B16 cells
supernatants, whereas the levels of IL-10 drop after just 12
hours of stimulation of B16 cells with LPS (Fig. 1C). In contrast,
the levels of TGFb were not modiﬁed.
LPS-stimulated B16 cell supernatants can partially
reverse the suppressive effect of B16 cell–derived factors
on Tlr4lps-del BMDC maturation
Tumor-derived factors signiﬁcantly inhibit the generation of
DCs from hematopoietic progenitors, increase the accumulation of myeloid suppressor cells (usually characterized as
GR1þ CD11bþ cells), and inhibit DCs maturation (29–31). To
see if factors secreted by LPS-stimulated B16 cells could
somehow overcome this inhibitory effect, we collected supernatants from B16 cells stimulated for 48 hours with 1 mg/mL
Ultrapure LPS (LPS-B16 CM) or from nonstimulated cells (B16CM) and incubated with BMDCs from Tlr4lps-del mice for 20
hours before inducing their maturation with CpG. We used
BMDCs from Tlr4lps-del mice to exclude any direct effect on the
maturation state of the DCs by vestigial LPS in the CM. We
hypothesize that factors present in B16-CM would interfere in
this process, inhibiting the transcription of key effector molecules, whereas LPS-B16 CM would do it at a lesser extent or
would not do it at all. After 4 hours of stimulation of Tlr4lps-del
BMDCs with CpG, transcription of genes coding for effector
molecules such as IL-12a (x8), IL-1a (x12), IL-1b (x7), IL-6 (x11),

TNFa (x20), Csf2 (x15), Csf3 (x16) was increased (Fig. 2A).
Transcription of genes related with the NFkB complex was
not observed, although the expression of inhibitors of the
pathway such as NFkBia (IkBalpha) showed a moderate raise
(x11). When the same analysis was done in Tlr4lps-del BMDCs
that had been incubated with B16-CM and LPS-B16 CM prior to
maturation, some intriguing ﬁndings were detected. Transcription of genes coding for some effector molecules was not
extremely altered (such as IL-1a and b, TNF and IL-6). Other
genes were extremely downregulated in both experimental
groups subjected to tumor supernatants (such as Csf2 and
Csf3). In contrast, differences were found in the expression of
certain genes among the 3 experimental groups. When transcription of genes of the NFkB complex was evaluated, only
Tlr4lps-del BMDCs matured in the presence of LPS-B16 CM
showed a signiﬁcant increase (x380 NFkb1, x468 Rela), indicating a more sustained or stronger stimulation of the cells.
Reasonably, a strong increase in transcription levels of both
inhibitor molecules such as NFkBia (IkBalpha) and NFkBib
(IkBbeta) was also observed (x80 and x1250 compared with x33
and x375 in B16-CM). Interestingly, the expression of IL-12a
that was inhibited in DCs incubated with B16-CM (x1.8) was
partially restored when LPS-B16 CM (x5) was present at the
time of maturation.
Next, we examined the ability of B16-CM and LPS-B16 CM to
modulate cytokine secretion by DCs. As expected, immature
DCs (iDCs) exposed to CpG showed a signiﬁcant increase in IL12p40 secretion (Fig. 2B). A 5-fold reduction in IL-12p40
secretion was observed when iDCs were simultaneously incubated with B16-CM and CpG for 24 hours. This reduction was
not due to an expansion of Gr1þCD11cþ at the expense of
CD11cþ cells, because the exposure of the iDCs for 24 hours to
CM did not alter the ﬁnal phenotype of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). In contrast, IL-12p40 secretion levels were
partially restored when the cells were incubated with LPS-B16
CM (3-fold reduction, P < 0.05; Fig. 2B). Similar results were
observed when IL-12p70 levels were evaluated: even though
CpG alone is a poor inducer of IL-12p70 (32), detectable levels
of IL-12p70 could be reliably measured in Tlr4lps-del DCs
exposed to CpG (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2C). These
levels were almost abrogated when Tlr4lps-del DCs were incubated with B16-CM, LPS-B16 CM, and B16-CM plus CpG.
In contrast, IL-12p70 was partially restored when Tlr4lps-del
DCs were matured with CpG in the presence of LPS-B16 CM
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2C). When TNFa (Fig. 2B)
and IL-6 (data not shown) were measured a similar effect was
observed. The levels of these cytokines present in B16-CM or

LPS-B16 CM did not signiﬁcantly interfere with those secreted
by DCs.
TGFb is also secreted by the tumor itself as an escape
mechanism (29, 30, 33). TGFb levels in B16-CM and LPS-B16
CM were similar to those measured in Tlr4lps-del BMDCs in
basal conditions. When Tlr4lps-del BMDCs were incubated
with B16-CM for 20 hours, TGFb levels raised approximately
1.5 times compared with those detected in the B16 cells
supernatants, suggesting that under these experimental conditions, DCs are also a source of TGFb. When BMDCs
were incubated with LPS-B16 CM for 20 hours, TGFb levels
dropped signiﬁcantly (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, maturation of
Tlr4lps-del BMDCs in the presence of LPS-B16 CM signiﬁcantly
reduces the levels of TGFb secreted, when compared with
those secreted by DCs matured in the presence of B16-CM,
supporting our hypothesis that DC proactivating factors are
increased in LPS-B16 CM.
In vitro stimulation of B16 cells with TLR4 agonists, such as
LPS or monophosphoril lipid A, for 48 hours before inoculation
produced signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth in syngeneic
C57BL/6 or in Tlr4lps-del mice. Because this effect was not
observed in athymic nude mice, T cells must somehow be
involved. DCs are crucial in initiating a Th1 response, mainly
through the secretion of IL-12. To test whether cytokines
secreted by DCs were crucial intermediaries in the inhibition
of tumor growth observed in LPS-B16 tumor-bearing mice, we
induced tumors with B16 or LPS-B16 cells in Tlr4lps-del and IL12p40–deﬁcient mice. As expected, LPS-B16 tumors were
signiﬁcantly smaller than B16 tumors in TLR4lps-del mice; in
contrast, both experimental groups (B16 and LPS-B16) followed the same pattern of tumor growth in Il12p40/ mice,
indicating that either IL-12 or IL-23 (which share the IL-12p40
subunit) is required in the inhibition of tumor growth observed
in wt animals bearing LPS-B16 tumors (Fig. 2C). This experiment also suggests that DCs, one of the most proliﬁc producers of these cytokines could be involved in the inhibition of
tumor growth observed in our in vivo model.
LPS-B16 tumor–bearing mice show spleen DCs with a
more mature phenotype as well as increased frequencies
of IL-12þ CD11cþ and IFNgþ tumor-inﬁltrating cells
Then, Tlr4lps-del mice were subcutaneously injected with
B16 or LPS-B16 cells, sacriﬁced on day 20 and CD11cþ and
GR1þ CD11bþ cells from spleens and tumors were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry. A higher percentage of CD11cþ cells and
a lower percentage of GR1þ CD11bþ cells were found in the
spleens of animals bearing LPS-B16 tumors, compared with
those bearing B16 tumors or normal control (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Spleen CD11cþ cells from all tumorbearing animals showed an activated phenotype, with a
higher percentage of cells expressing increased levels of
MHC class II and costimulatory molecules (Fig. 3B). However, a further enhancement in the expression levels of CD40,
CD80 and, in some experiments, of CD86 was observed in
CD11cþ cells from animals bearing LPS-B16 tumors (Fig. 3B
and C).
Intratumoral inﬁltrating mononuclear cells were also analyzed. Although the percentage of CD11cþ cells in LPS-B16

tumors did not change (Fig. 3A), the frequency of IL-12þ
CD11cþ cells (Fig. 3D) was increased. Moreover, when
tumor-inﬁltrating mononuclear cells were stimulated ex vivo
with PMA–ionomycin for 5 hours and IFNg–IL-10 cytokine
intracellular staining was done, an increased frequency of
IFNgþ CD3þ cells was observed in LPS-B16 tumors compared
with B16 tumors. The opposite was observed when IL-10þ
CD3þ cells were analyzed (Fig. 3E and F).
Thus, LPS-B16 cells inoculated into Tlr4lps-del mice promoted
a better functionality of DCs in vivo, which could be associated
with a more efﬁcient Th1 response in situ and the reduced
tumor growth observed.
IFNb produced by TLR4-activated tumor cells is involved
in reversing the suppressive effect of B16 cell–derived
factors on Tlr4lps-del BMDC maturation
Induction of type I IFN during stimulation of DCs through
innate receptors is essential for optimal production of the IL-12
p70 heterodimer (33). Thus, we investigated the putative role of
IFNb present in LPS-B16 CM in restoring the suppressive effect
of B16-CM on Tlr4lps-del BMDC maturation. We looked at CD40
expression in Tlr4lps-del BMDCs incubated with LPS-B16 or B16CMs for 20 hours and matured with CpG. A neutralizing antiIFNb was added to the CMs 1 hour before incubating them with
DCs. As expected, the percentage of DCs expressing CD40
increases to an 80% after 4 hours of stimulation with CpG
(Fig. 4A). This increase is not affected with the addition of
anti-IFNb to the culture medium. An inhibition in the percentage of CD40þ CD11cþ cells and in the levels of CD40
expression is observed when Tlr4lps-del BMDCs were incubated
with B16-CM and then matured with CpG, which is restored
when the cells are matured in the presence of LPS-B16 CM. This
restitution of CD40 expression was abrogated when the neutralizing anti-IFNb was added, indicating that IFNb is participating in the improvement of DC maturation observed (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar results were obtained
when IL-12p70 secreted by the DCs under the different conditions were measured by ELISA (Fig. 4B).
To conﬁrm the role that type I IFN could be playing in our
model, we inoculated B16 or LPS-B16 cells into mice lacking
the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN receptor. Inhibition of
tumor growth was observed only in wild-type mice bearing
LPS-B16 tumors, indicating that type I IFN signaling is involved
in tumor growth inhibition induced by activation of TLR4
expressed on tumor cells (Fig. 4C). To observe whether IL-28
(a distinct category of type I–like IFN, also referred to as type III
IFN; ref. 34) could be playing a role in tumor inhibition in our
model, we inoculated B16 cells stimulated or not with LPS in
Il28r KO mice. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in
wild-type mice, but only a partial and nonstatistically significant inhibition of tumor growth was seen in the Il28r KO mice,
indicating that type III IFNs could also be playing a role in the
phenomenon (Fig. 4D).

C57BL/6 and Tlr4lps-del mice. In both models, a signiﬁcant
inhibition of tumor growth was observed in C57BL/6 animals
that received LPS injections once tumors became visible
(Fig. 5A). Interestingly, B16 and MB49 tumors in Tlr4lps-del
mice also showed a signiﬁcant but transient inhibition of
tumor growth that was sustained as long as the LPS treatment
was maintained. Immediately after the LPS treatment was
ﬁnished, tumors began to grow (Fig. 5B). However, although
nonstatistically different, tumor volumes kept being slightly
smaller in LPS-treated mice.

Discussion
B16-derived soluble factors strongly suppressed the activation of BMDCs in response to CpG, downregulating the secretion levels of IL-12p40, IL-12, and TNFa and diminishing the
percentage of CD40þ CD11cþcells. Interestingly, when
BMDCs from Tlr4lps-del mice were matured with CpG in the
presence of LPS-B16 CM, the inhibition observed in the different parameters was partially reversed. Although DCs

obtained from spleens of B16 and LPS-B16 tumor–bearing
mice both show an activated phenotype, it is improved in the
latter group. Also, an increase in IL-12þ CD11cþ cells inﬁltrating tumors was observed, further providing evidence of
their improved functional state in vivo. Initial CD4þ T-cell
activation occurs in secondary lymph nodes, but to elicit
effector functions, in lymph nodes or in nonlymphoid tissues
such as tumors, they need to see again the speciﬁc MHC II–
peptide complexes to produce effector cytokines, such as IFNg
(35). Tumor cells do not express MHC class II molecules;
therefore, inﬁltrating DCs would sustain CD4 T-cell stimulation (36, 37). Tumor-inﬁltrating DCs have already been
described in B16 melanomas, in numbers even higher than
those found in normal skin, being poor producers of IL-12. The
fact that tumor-inﬁltrating mononuclear cells produce higher
levels of IFNg and reduced levels of IL-10, argues in favor of a
more efﬁcient immune response taking place in LPS-B16
tumor–bearing animals, responsible for controlling tumor
growth.
Thus, upon TLR4 activation, B16 cells could secrete a
different pattern of soluble factors and cytokines, which would

favor the balance to a friendlier environment for activating
DCs. Transcriptional analysis of LPS-stimulated B16 cells
conﬁrms this idea. The expression of GM-CSF and G-CSF genes
considerably increases as well as those involved in the type I
IFN pathway. Also, the levels of IL-6 and TNFa are increased in
LPS-stimulated B16 cell supernatants. IL-6 has been involved
in activation of STAT3 in DCs, which in turn would contribute
to the inhibition of their phenotypic and functional maturation
(38). In contrast, type I IFN, TNFa, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have potent effect
in inducing maturation of DCs and have been used as adjuvant
therapy for advanced-stage melanoma in patients and in mice
(39). Thus, cytokines reported to have modulatory effects on
DC activation could simultaneously be present at augmented
or diminished levels in LPS-B16 CM making a cocktail that
would provide signals to DCs that, in turn, will be differentially
integrated.
The involvement of DCs in our tumor model could also be
indirectly analyzed by the lack of inhibition of tumor growth
induced by inoculation of LPS-stimulated B16 cells in mice
deﬁcient for IL-12p40 subunit, arguing that antigen-presenting
cells, main producers of IL-12 and IL-23 and presumably DCs,
play a key role in our model. Both IL-12p40 and IL-12p70
secretion levels are partially restored when TLR4/ DCs are
matured with CpG in the presence of LPS-B16 CM. Type I IFNs

12p70 (40, 41). Type I IFNs have an established role in regulating the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system
(34, 42–44), and when given exogenously to tumor patients,
retard tumor growth and inhibit angiogenesis (34). Mice
challenged with tumor cells that produce type I IFN as recombinant protein do not develop tumors (45–47). B16 tumors
grew faster in Ifnb1/ mice and they reach larger sizes
and higher weights compared with wt mice (45–47). Also,
Ifnar1/ mice are more susceptible to the development of
sarcomas induced with a chemical carcinogen. As it has been
reported previously, the levels of IFNb secreted under our
experimental conditions were very low and difﬁcult to measure
with commercial ELISA kits (45, 46). U'Ren L and colleagues
have found that in vitro cultured tumor tissues spontaneously
released low concentrations of IFN-a (in the range of 5 pg/mL)
and that concentrations of IFN-b in cultured tumor supernatants were below the level of detection of the ELISA
(<100 pg/mL; ref. 46). However, these low levels were enough
to inhibit the generation of tumor-associated macrophages
and to restrict tumor angiogenesis (45, 46).
Type III IFNs (also known as IL-28 and IL-29) could also have
a role in the inhibition of tumor growth observed in LPS-B16
tumors. They share the same intracellular signaling with type I
IFNs but use a cell surface receptor, IL-28R, mainly expressed in
epithelial layers (34, 43). B16 cells express IL-28R (48). LPS-B16
tumors in Il28r KO mice are not signiﬁcantly smaller but still
show a reduced growth compared with B16 tumors. Therefore,

we could hypothesize that IL-28 (produced by either LPSactivated tumor cells or host cells) could participate in this
minor effect.
In our model, IFNb produced by TLR4-activated tumor cells
is involved in restoring the suppressive effect of B16 cell–
derived factors on Tlr4lps-del BMDC maturation. Also, lack of
inhibition of tumor growth is observed when LPS-stimulated
B16 cells are inoculated in Ifnar1/ mice. Thus, endogenous
IFNb, secreted by LPS-stimulated B16 cells could be enough to
improve the maturation state of local DCs, promoting the
secretion of IL-12 and then a more efﬁcient antitumoral
response (Fig. 6). Our ﬁndings show, for the ﬁrst time, that
tumor cells can be manipulated with classical adjuvants to
contribute positively to the antitumoral immune response.
Another aspect that should be discussed is whether this
positive contribution could actually happen in more realistic
scenarios such as therapeutic settings in which the adjuvant is
administered once tumors are visible. Only a transitory halt of
tumor growth was observed in both, B16 and MB49 tumors in
Tlr4lps-del animals which were intratumorally treated with LPS,
indicating that type I IFN is necessary but not sufﬁcient. In both
cases, it has to be highlighted that even in the absence of TLR4
on innate immune cells (which are the expected target of LPS),

tumor growth is controlled by the LPS treatment (at least
transiently) in a context in which it can only be recognized by
tumor cells.
The role of TLRs and, particularly, TLR4 in tumorigenesis
and tumor promotion is highly controversial. Further research
in this topic will open up new avenues for understanding tumor
biology and for identifying potential new therapy strategies for
cancer.
