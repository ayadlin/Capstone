Abstract
5-Chloro-6-[2,6-difluoro-4-[3-(methylamino)propoxy]phenyl]N -[(1S )-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methylethyl]-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-7-amine butanedioate (TTI-237) is a microtubule-active compound of novel structure and function.
Structurally, it is one of a class of compounds, triazolo[1,5a]pyrimidines, previously not known to bind to tubulin.
Functionally, TTI-237 inhibited the binding of [3H]vinblastine
to tubulin, but it caused a marked increase in turbidity
development that more closely resembled the effect observed
with docetaxel than that observed with vincristine. The
morphologic character of the presumptive polymer is unknown at present. When applied to cultured human tumor
cells at concentrations near its IC50 value for cytotoxicity (34
nmol/L), TTI-237 induced multiple spindle poles and multinuclear cells, as did paclitaxel, but not vincristine or
colchicine. Flow cytometry experiments revealed that, at low
concentrations (20–40 nmol/L), TTI-237 produced sub-G1
nuclei and, at concentrations above 50 nmol/L, it caused a
strong G2-M block. The compound was a weak substrate of
multidrug resistance 1 (multidrug resistance transporter or
P-glycoprotein). In a cell line expressing a high level of
P-glycoprotein, the IC50 of TTI-237 increased 25-fold whereas
those of paclitaxel and vincristine increased 806-fold and 925fold, respectively. TTI-237 was not recognized by the MRP or
MXR transporters. TTI-237 was active in vivo in several nude
mouse xenograft models of human cancer, including LoVo
human colon carcinoma and U87-MG human glioblastoma,
when dosed i.v. or p.o. Thus, TTI-237 has a set of properties
that distinguish it from other classes of microtubule-active
compounds. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2292–300]

Introduction
Microtubules, composed mainly of ah-tubulin heterodimers and
also numerous associated proteins, are macromolecular structures
that participate in many crucial cellular functions (1). Microtubules
are a proven target in cancer treatment because they are part of the
mitotic spindle, the complex and dynamic structure that mediates
chromosome separation at mitosis (2–5). Without a functional
spindle, cells cannot divide correctly and typically undergo
apoptosis (6). The discovery of new antimitotic compounds, both
those targeting microtubules and those targeting other components of the mitotic machinery, has received much attention (7, 8).

At the present time, there are two categories of tubulin-binding
compounds that are approved for cancer therapy: Vinca alkaloids
(vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, and vindesine) and taxanes
(paclitaxel and docetaxel). Vinca alkaloids bind at one of three
known pharmacologic sites on the tubulin heterodimer, called the
Vinca site (3). Many other compounds, mostly natural products,
also bind at or near this site (9, 10); collectively, the region of the
protein where these compounds bind is called the Vinca domain.
Vinca domain ligands destabilize microtubules and inhibit
microtubule formation. Taxanes (and several other classes of
natural products; ref. 11) bind at the taxane site to stabilize and
promote formation of microtubules, the opposite effects of Vincas.
A third site, defined by colchicine, also binds many ligands, both
natural and synthetic, all of which destabilize microtubules and
inhibit their formation. We report here a new compound, 5-chloro6-[2,6-difluoro-4-[3-(methylamino)propoxy]phenyl]-N-[(1S)-2,2,2trifluoro-1-methylethyl]-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a ]pyrimidin-7-amine
butanedioate (TTI-237; Fig. 1), that differs in significant ways from
known tubulin ligands. TTI-237 may be the prototype of a new
category of tubulin-binding compound. It is potent and shows
in vivo antitumor activity in xenograft models.

Materials and Methods
Materials
TTI-237, as the free base, the hydrochloride salt, or the succinate salt,
was synthesized as described (12). In all cases, the compound was used as
a stock solution in DMSO and was stored at 20jC. Paclitaxel, vincristine,
and colchicine were obtained from Sigma, and docetaxel was obtained
from LKT Laboratories, Inc.; all were used as stock solutions in DMSO
with storage at 20jC. Microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-rich tubulin,
also called microtubule protein, containing f70% tubulin and 30% MAPs
(ML113), and highly purified tubulin (>99% pure; TL238), both from bovine
brain, were obtained from Cytoskeleton, Inc. Both of these were
lyophilized products and contained small amounts of guanosine 5¶triphosphate (GTP; approximately equivalent to 0.5 mmol/L GTP when
the protein concentration was 10 mg/mL). PEM buffer [80 mmol/L
piperazine-N,N¶-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (pH 6.9), 1 mmol/L ethylene
glycol-bis(h-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N¶,N¶-tetraacetic acid, 1 mmol/L magnesium chloride], GTP, and the advanced protein assay reagent were also
obtained from Cytoskeleton. Glycerol was purchased from Pierce, and
2¶,3¶-dideoxy-GTP was from Sigma.
[3H]Vinblastine (specific activity, 9.6 Ci/mmol) and MicroSpin G-50
columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences; columns were
prepared for use according to the manufacturer’s instructions. [3H]Colchicine (specific activity, 76.5 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England
Nuclear, and [3H]paclitaxel (specific activity, 14.7 Ci/mmol) was from
Moravek Biochemicals.

Methods
Cell lines. Human cancer cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, except for KB-3-1 (herein called KB, cloned from a
human epidermoid carcinoma) and the derived lines KB-8-5 and KB-V1,
which express moderate and very high levels of the multidrug resistance 1

(MDR1; P-glycoprotein) drug transporter protein, respectively, which
were provided by Dr. M. Gottesman (National Cancer Institute; ref. 13)
via Dr. L. Greenberger (Wyeth Research). Unless otherwise noted, all cell
lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine and supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (all from Life Technologies). Cells were incubated at 37jC in
humidified 5% CO2 in air. Resistant cells were cultured without selective
drug for at least 1 wk before use.
Cytotoxicity assay. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed,
counted, and distributed to wells of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates
at 1,000 cells per well in 200 AL of medium. All plates were incubated at
37jC in humidified 5% CO2 in air for f24 h.
On day 2, compounds for test were diluted and added to wells.
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 10 to 20 mmol/L. For each
compound, nine serial 2-fold dilutions were prepared in DMSO. Ten
microliters of each dilution was transferred to 100 AL of medium and
mixed well, and then 5 AL of this dilution were transferred in triplicate or
quadruplicate to wells containing cells. The final high concentration of

each compound was typically 5 Amol/L. All cultures, including controls
with no compound, contained a final concentration of 0.27% DMSO. After
3 d of culture with test compounds (day 5 overall), the MTS assay
(Promega; CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay)
was done on all wells. The averaged replicates for each compound at each
concentration level were plotted against concentration, and the concentration that produced a relative color yield half way between the
maximum (no compound) and minimum (all cells killed) was taken as
the IC50 value.
Tubulin polymerization experiments. Immediately before use, microtubule protein or purified tubulin was dissolved in ice-cold PEM buffer.
When used, GTP was present in PEM buffer at 1 mmol/L. In the case of
purified tubulin without added GTP, the PEM buffer contained 10% (w/v)
glycerol. The tubulin solution was centrifuged at top speed in an Eppendorf
model 5415C microcentrifuge (Brinkmann Instruments) for 10 min at 4jC
to remove any particles or aggregates. The supernatant from this
centrifugation was dispensed at 100 AL per well to wells of a half-area
96-well plate (Corning, Inc.) already containing 10 AL of the compounds of
interest. Compounds were diluted in the same buffer used for tubulin
solubilization before being added to wells. The final compound concentrations and tubulin concentration are given in figure legends. Each
compound was tested in duplicate at each concentration in each
experiment. The polymerization plate was prepared at room temperture,
and the cold tubulin solution was the final addition. As rapidly as possible
after tubulin addition, the plate was put in a SpectraMax Plus plate reader
(Molecular Devices Corp.), thermostated at either 24jC or 35jC, and mixed
for 15 s using the instrument mix function, and the absorbance of each well
at 340 nm was determined every minute for 60 min. An increase in apparent
absorbance at 340 nm over the course of the reaction was a measure of the
appearance of turbidity believed to be caused by the formation of tubulin
polymers of unknown morphology. The absorbance at time 0 for each well
was subtracted from each of the subsequent absorbance readings for that
well, and then the duplicates were averaged. Every other point is shown in
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. S1 to S3 for clarity.

Cancer Research
To measure very rapid turbidity development that might occur before the
first absorbance reading could be made, the background absorbance of each
well of the empty reaction plate was taken before each assay. (Control
experiments showed that the absorbance of the empty wells was the same
as that of wells filled with unpolymerized tubulin starting solution.) If the
time 0 absorbance reading differed from the background absorbance
reading of that well, then the time 0 value was corrected accordingly.
Competitive binding experiments. To study possible competition at
the Vinca domain and colchicine site, incubations were done under
conditions which do not favor polymerization because vinblastine and
colchicine bind preferentially to unpolymerized heterodimer. Highly
purified tubulin was dissolved in PEM buffer without GTP and used at
a final concentration of 1.0 to 1.3 mg/mL (10–13 Amol/L). Aliquots of
competitor stock solutions were added to aliquots of the tubulin solution to
give final concentrations of 100 Amol/L, and then aliquots of either
[3H]vinblastine or [3H]colchicine were added to give final concentrations of
100 nmol/L or 50 nmol/L, respectively. Each reaction was run in
quadruplicate. These solutions were incubated at 24jC for 1 h and then
applied to MicroSpin G-50 columns which were centrifuged for 2 min at
3,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C microfuge. An aliquot of each column
effluent (containing tubulin and bound radioligand) was mixed with
scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer.
Controls included samples without competitor and samples with unlabeled
vincristine, colchicine, or paclitaxel. The ability of the competitor to inhibit
the binding of the radioligand was expressed as a percentage of control
binding in the absence of any competitor.
For competition with [3H]paclitaxel, preformed microtubules were used
because paclitaxel binds preferentially to microtubules rather than free
heterodimer. Highly purified tubulin was dissolved in PEM buffer
containing 0.75 mol/L glutamate and 25 Amol/L dideoxy-GTP; final protein
concentration was 0.25 to 0.35 mg/mL (2.5–3.5 Amol/L). These conditions
foster the rapid formation of short stable microtubule polymers (14). This
solution was incubated for 30 min at 37jC to allow microtubules to form.
Then aliquots of the microtubule solution were added to microfuge tubes
already containing both [3H]paclitaxel ( final concentration of 2.1 Amol/L,
1.2 Ci/mmol) and competitors at the final concentrations given in the
figures, and incubation at 37jC was continued for another 30 min. The
samples were then centrifuged at top speed in an Eppendorf 5415C
microfuge for 20 min at room temperature to pellet the microtubule
protein. Triplicate aliquots of each supernatant were mixed with
scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. From
the amount of radioactivity in the supernatants and the measured total
starting radioactivity, the amount of [3H]paclitaxel bound to pelleted
microtubule protein was calculated. In addition, duplicate aliquots of each
supernatant were taken for analysis of protein content using the advanced
protein assay. From the amount of protein in the supernatants and the
measured total starting protein concentration, the amount of protein in the
pellets was calculated. Controls included samples without competitor and
samples with unlabeled vincristine, colchicine, or paclitaxel. The ability of
each competitor to inhibit radioligand binding to pelleted protein and to
change the amount of protein in the pellets was expressed as a percentage
of control without any competitor.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (all from Life Technologies). For experiments,
cells were plated at 2.5  104 per 0.5 mL per chamber of Biocoat polyD-lysine–coated eight-well culture slides (Becton Dickinson Labware).
Compounds were added to chambers the next day in a volume of 5 AL
DMSO, giving a final DMSO concentration of 1%. Twenty hours later,
medium was removed from the wells, the chamber sides were lifted off, and
cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for a minimum of 10 min. The slides
were removed from methanol and allowed to air-dry. All remaining steps
were done at room temperature. The cells were washed with two changes of
PBS (10 min each time, in a Copland jar), then incubated with anti
a-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, clone DM1-A, Sigma) in 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA; IgG free and protease free, from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

PBS for 10 min each time, then incubated with secondary antibody [1:100
dilution of FITC-conjugated goat antimouse IgG, F(ab¶)2 specific, Jackson
ImmunoResearch] in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h in the dark. After two washes
with PBS, 5 min each, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular
Probes) at 6 Ag/mL in PBS for 10 min, followed by two PBS washes. Finally,
cells were mounted in SlowFade Light (Molecular Probes) and examined
with an Olympus BX61 microscope using a 40 UPlanApo air objective.
Images were acquired with a Cooke SensiCam CCD imaging camera and
Sliderule software.
Flow cytometry. HeLa cells were plated at 1.25  105 in 2 mL/well in
12-well plates and cultured overnight. Then various concentrations of
compounds were added as indicated in the figures, and culture was
continued for 18 h. Cells were then harvested, taking care to recover all
nonadherent as well as adherent cells from each well. The recovered cells
were processed using the Cycle Test Plus DNA reagent kit from Becton
Dickinson. This kit contains reagents to dissolve cell membrane lipids with
a nonionic detergent, degrade structural proteins with trypsin, remove RNA
with RNase, and stabilize the nuclear chromatin with spermine. The
cleaned, isolated nuclei were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed
by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur instrument from Becton Dickinson.
Nuclei were analyzed instead of cells because this approach gives greater
accuracy in DNA content estimates (15) and because we wished to detect
nuclei from multinuclear cells, although mitotic cells, which lack a nuclear
envelope, may not be accurately measured. Each compound was analyzed in
three independent experiments, and data were averaged to make the graphs
presented here. Estimates of the fraction of total nuclei in each cell cycle
compartment were done by visually setting markers on the population
histograms as illustrated in Fig. 5B.
Tumor xenograft experiments. Athymic nu/nu female mice were
implanted s.c. in the flank with either 1  107 LoVo human colon
adenocarcinoma cells or 1  106 U87-MG human glioblastoma cells. Cells
were suspended in culture medium for injection. When tumors attained a
mass of between 80 and 120 mg (day 0), animals were randomized into
treatment groups each containing 5 to 10 animals. After staging, animals
were treated i.v. or p.o. with TTI-237 formulated in 0.9% saline or Klucel
according to the schedules given in the figure legend or with vehicle alone.
Tumor volumes [(length  width2) / 2] were determined at regular
intervals. Results are reported as relative tumor growth (mean tumor
volume on day measured divided by the mean tumor volume on day 0) as a
function of time after staging. The data were analyzed by a one-sided
Student’s t test. A P value of V0.05 indicated a statistically significant
reduction in tumor growth of the treated group compared with that of the
vehicle control group.

Results
TTI-237 causes marked turbidity development with both
microtubule protein and purified tubulin. Figure 2 shows the
effects of TTI-237 on the aggregation of microtubule protein or
pure tubulin in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L GTP. TTI-237
was studied at six concentrations, ranging from below to above
the concentration of tubulin. At 0.1, 0.3, and 0.9 Amol/L with microtubule protein (i.e., with tubulin in excess by a factor of f100 to
11-fold), TTI-237 reduced the lag phase and enhanced the rate of
aggregation compared with the control reaction without added
compound (Fig. 2A). By comparison, docetaxel at the same
concentrations had similar but quantitatively greater enhancing
effects (Supplementary Fig. S1A), whereas vincristine progressively
inhibited polymerization, such that at 0.9 Amol/L (and also at
2.7 Amol/L), microtubule formation was completely inhibited
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Colchicine also inhibited polymerization
of microtubule protein in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
There was a qualitative change in the effect of TTI-237 on
microtubule protein aggregation at a concentration of 2.7 Amol/L

and above. The lag phase was greatly reduced or eliminated, and
the curves assumed a hyperbolic rather than S-shaped appearance
(Fig. 2A). Concentrations of 8.1 and 24.3 Amol/L TTI-237 (TTI-237
in rough molar equivalence and molar excess over tubulin,
respectively) produced hyperbolic curves with much higher
plateaus. The polymerization curves induced by the same
concentrations of docetaxel were also hyperbolic (Supplemetary
Fig. S1A). Vincristine at 8.1 and 24.3 Amol/L produced hyperbolic
aggregation curves, reflecting the property of this compound to
induce formation of nonmicrotubule aggregates at high concentrations (ref. 16; Supplementary Fig. S2A). The plateaus reached by
vincristine-containing reactions were much lower than those
reached in the presence of docetaxel or TTI-237. Colchicine, on
the other hand, progressively inhibited polymerization of microtubule protein (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Figures 2B and C show the effect of TTI-237 on the aggregation
of microtubule protein without added GTP and on highly purified
tubulin with GTP, respectively. In both cases, TTI-237 at some
concentrations caused tubulin aggregation. Docetaxel was more
potent in both situations (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C);
vincristine at 2.7, 8.1, and 24.3 Amol/L caused aggregation of
microtubule protein without added GTP (Supplementary Fig. S2B),
but the curves continued to increase after a 1-hour reaction time,
unlike those of docetaxel and TTI-237 which reached a plateau.
Colchicine inhibited the very weak intrinsic polymerization of
microtubule protein without added GTP (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
and neither vincristine nor colchicine had any effect on highly
purified tubulin with GTP (Supplementary Figs. S2C and S3C).

www.aacrjournals.org

TTI-237 was also able to induce aggregation of highly purified
tubulin in the absence of added GTP (Fig. 2D). By itself, such
tubulin does not spontaneously polymerize. TTI-237 was active
only at concentrations of 8.1 and 23.4 Amol/L, i.e., near or above the
concentration of tubulin heterodimers. Docetaxel induced measurable polymerization at concentrations as low as 0.1 Amol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). Vincristine and colchicine did not
induce aggregation at any tested concentration (Supplementary
Figs. S2D and S3D).
TTI-237 inhibits binding of vinblastine to tubulin. TTI-237
competed with [3H]vinblastine, but not with [3H]colchicine, for
binding to purified tubulin heterodimers. Vincristine and TTI-237
substantially inhibited the binding of [3H]vinblastine to tubulin
heterodimers, but colchicine and paclitaxel did not (Fig. 3A).
In comparison, using the same set of inhibitor compounds, only
colchicine inhibited the binding of [3H]colchicine (Fig. 3B). Further
experiments were done using a range of TTI-237 concentrations
to determine whether the inhibition of [3H]vinblastine binding
was competitive. However, these experiments yielded inconclusive
results, perhaps because the aggregation state of tubulin in
the reactions changed with time in the presence of TTI-237
(not shown).
Competition with [3H]paclitaxel for binding to preformed
microtubules was done using a sedimentation assay which allowed
both the amount of protein in the pellets and the amount of bound
radioactivity to be determined (Fig. 3C and D). Unlabeled paclitaxel
strongly inhibited the amount of [3H]paclitaxel recovered in
the sedimented pellets, but increased the amount of protein

in the pellets. In contrast, vincristine initially inhibited both protein
and radioactivity in the pellets; but as vincristine concentration
increased, the amount of protein in the pellets also increased
whereas the radioactivity in those pellets remained low. This was
because vincristine initially depolymerized the preformed microtubules, causing a decrease in both protein and radioactivity in the
pellets. At higher vincristine concentrations, nonmicrotubule
aggregates which contributed to the increased protein in the
pellets were formed. However, [3H]paclitaxel did not bind well to
these abnormal aggregates. Colchicine caused a coordinate and
concentration-dependent decline in both protein and radioactivity
in the sedimented pellets. This reflected the action of colchicine to
depolymerize the preformed microtubules without inducing
abnormal aggregates. The effects of TTI-237 in this assay were
different from those of any of these reference compounds. TTI-237
did not reduce either protein or radioactivity in the sedimented
microtubules. This indicated that TTI-237 neither competed with
[3H]paclitaxel for binding to microtubules nor depolymerized the
microtubules. Such a result is consistent with two interpretations:
that TTI-237 does not bind to microtubules at all or it binds at a
site distinct from the taxane site without causing microtubule
depolymerization. In combination with the other results presented
here, the latter interpretation is favored.
Taken together, these competitive binding experiments show
that TTI-237 does not bind at the colchicine or taxane sites. We
have not yet been able to show whether the inhibition of
[3H]vinblastine binding is competitive or allosteric. Therefore,
TTI-237 binds either to the Vinca domain or to a novel site on
tubulin that allosterically affects vinblastine binding.
TTI-237 induces multiple spindle poles and multinuclear
cells. Control HeLa cells had predominantly single nuclei and wellformed, highly detailed microtubule networks (Fig. 4A). Aberrant
cells were rare, and mitoses were normal (not shown). At
concentrations as low as 17 nmol/L, TTI-237 caused the
appearance of extra centrosome-like microtubule organizing
centers in some mitotic cells, although the overall frequency of
mitotic cells was not increased; these organizing centers were

apparently functional, as judged by the Y-shaped structure of
chromatin (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Figure 4B shows a cell that
appears to be dividing into triplets, and each of the progeny cells
seems to be binuclear or at least to have a bilobed nucleus.
At 34 nmol/L (near its IC50 value of 40 nmol/L on HeLa cells),
TTI-237 continued to induce abnormal, multipolar mitotic spindles
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Other images (not shown) revealed that
although many of the mitotic figures were abnormal, the mitotic
index at this concentration was not changed substantially from
control. Thus, TTI-237 did not induce mitotic arrest of HeLa cells
at this concentration. Instead, many of the cells with abnormal
spindles seemed to continue through mitosis and reenter G1 phase
with multiple nuclei (typically 2–4). Figure 4C shows that these
multinuclear cells had reformed interphase microtubules that
seemed similar to those in control cells (Fig. 4A). At 68 nmol/L with
HeLa cells, TTI-237 caused a strong mitotic block (Fig. 4D). The
blocked cells were characterized by having three to eight dense
clusters of microtubules. Microtubules in interphase cells still
seemed normal (not shown). At no concentration up to 1 Amol/L
did TTI-237 induce the bundling of interphase microtubules that is
characteristic of taxanes.
By comparison, paclitaxel, at low concentrations (around its
cytotoxic IC50 value of 3 nmol/L in a 3-day cytotoxicity assay) and
at early times (18–20 hours after addition to cells), did not induce a
mitotic block, but rather produced mitotic cells with multiple
tubulin nucleation centers (refs. 17–21 and data not shown). These
cells were able to proceed through mitosis, producing progeny G1
cells with multiple nuclei as a result of failed or abnormal
cytokinesis (18). In contrast, vincristine and colchicine caused a
weak mitotic block at 20 hours at concentrations around their IC50
values (2 and 20 nmol/L, respectively) and did not produce
significant numbers of multinuclear cells (ref. 17 and data not
shown).
TTI-237 produces sub-G1 nuclei at a concentration lower
than that required for mitotic block. Detailed evaluations of the
effects of TTI-237 on cell cycle progression as a function of
concentration were carried out, using a flow cytometry procedure

that determined the DNA content of washed and stabilized nuclei
obtained from treated cells. In the absence of compound, f61%
of the counted nuclei were in G1 phase, 15% were in S phase, and
15% were in G2-M phase (Fig. 5A and D). In addition, f8% had a
sub-G1 (or <2N) DNA content, and 1% had >4N content. As TTI-237
concentration increased from 10 to 35 nmol/L (20-hour incubation), there was a sharp decline in the G1 population and a

www.aacrjournals.org

corresponding increase in the sub-G1 population, which reached
f60% of the total nuclei counted at its peak; there was little
change in the S, G2-M, or >4N populations (Fig. 5B and D). At
concentrations higher than 35 nmol/L, the sub-G1 peak fell and the
G2-M peak increased (Fig. 5C and D), reaching plateau values that
remained constant to 200 nmol/L.
Docetaxel also produced a strong peak of sub-G1 nuclei at
concentrations around its cytotoxic IC50 value (f1 nmol/L),
without an increase in the G2-M population (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). At higher concentrations, the sub-G1 population declined
and the G2-M population increased, but these changes were not as
dramatic as with TTI-237. Vincristine and colchicine, on the other
hand, did not produce peaks of sub-G1 nuclei at any tested
concentration (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). Rather, with both
compounds, there was a gradual increase in the sub-G1 population
that paralleled the increase in G2-M.
Cytotoxic activity of TTI-237. Multiple batches of TTI-237,
including the free base form, hydrochloride, and succinate salts,
were tested in a 3-day cytotoxicity assay with COLO 205 cells over
a period of many months. The mean IC50 value F SD from 43
assays was 34 F 10 nmol/L. There were no differences in activity
among the free base and salt forms. IC50 values for several
reference compounds in this assay are given in Supplementary
Table S1.
The cytotoxic activity of TTI-237 was also tested on several
other human tumor cell lines from various tissues (Supplementary
Table S2). The compound showed good activity (between 18 and
40 nmol/L IC50 values) on lines from ovarian, breast, prostate, and
cervical tumors.
TTI-237 is a poor substrate of P-glycoprotein. The activity of
TTI-237 against cells expressing the MDR1 multidrug resistance
transporter, P-glycoprotein, was assessed in two lines derived from
human KB epidermoid carcinoma cells. KB, the parental line,
expresses no P-glycoprotein; KB-8-5 expresses a moderate level of
P-glycoprotein, and KB-VI expresses a very high level. The
recognition of a compound by P-glycoprotein can be assessed by
the resistance ratio, which is the ratio of the IC50 value on the
resistant line to that on the sensitive parental line. Results for
TTI-237, paclitaxel, vincristine, colchicine, and several other
compounds, are shown in Supplementary Table S3. The resistance
ratio for TTI-237 on KB-8-5 was 2.9, indicating very little resistance,
whereas the values for paclitaxel and vincristine were 11 and 26,
respectively. On the highly expressing KB-VI line, the ratios
for TTI-237, paclitaxel, and vincristine were 25, 806, and 925,
respectively. Therefore, TTI-237 is a poor substrate of the
P-glycoprotein transporter and retains substantial activity against
lines expressing this protein.
Similar experiments on appropriate nonexpressing and expressing cell lines showed that TTI-237 was not a substrate of the MRP
or MXR transporters (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5).
TTI-237 is active by i.v. and p.o. administration against
human tumor xenografts. Because of the successful clinical use
of Vinca alkaloids and taxanes in the treatment of cancer, TTI237 was tested for antitumor efficacy in two mouse xenograft
models. In the first, the compound, which has excellent solubility
in water, was formulated in 0.9% saline and given i.v. to athymic
mice bearing staged tumors of LoVo human colon adenocarcinoma. The compound was given every 4 days for four cycles at
doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg/dose. The compound showed
dose-dependent effects, with good antitumor activity at 20 and
15 mg/kg (Fig. 6A).

vehicle only (Klucel) by i.v. injection. The control
group contained 10 animals and each experimental group contained nine animals. In both

different than control.

In the second model, U87-MG human glioblastoma, TTI-237 was
given both i.v. and p.o. at a single dose of 25 mg/kg to tumorbearing mice. The compound was about equally effective by the
two routes (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
TTI-237 is unusual among tubulin ligands because (a) it
displaces [3H]vinblastine from the ah-heterodimer but it does not
depolymerize microtubules; it does not displace [3H]colchicine or
[3H]paclitaxel; (b) it promotes the aggregation of both microtubule protein and purified tubulin in biochemical assays; and (c) it
promotes the formation of multiple centrosome-like microtubule
organizing centers and multinuclear cells, like paclitaxel, but it
does not cause microtubule bundling. The compound is also
potent, fully synthetic, of fairly simple structure, water soluble,
not a good substrate of P-glycoprotein, and shows in vivo activity.
Thus, there is a reasonable expectation that TTI-237 could show
efficacious effects in cancer patients.
Most examples of tubulin-polymerizing small molecules are
natural products of complex structure, e.g., taxanes, including
paclitaxel and docetaxel, epothilones (22), discodermolide (23),
sarcodictyins (24), eleutherobins (25), laulimalides (26), peloruside
A (27), dictyostatins (28), cyclostreptin (29), and taccalonolides
(30), some of which are not water soluble and/or not available in
large quantities. Among this group, only paclitaxel and docetaxel
have achieved clinical approval, although several of these classes
offer promising future prospects (31).
The compounds that seem to be most similar to TTI-237 in
pharmacologic properties are rhazinilam (32) and ceratamines
A and B (33). ()-Rhazinilam, derived from a natural product
of complicated structure during isolation, induced the formation
of anomalous tubulin assemblies (spirals). This process was
prevented by vinblastine and maytansine, but not by colchicine.
Saturable and stoichiometric binding of radioactive rhazinilam
to tubulin in spirals was reported, and binding was abolished
in the presence of vinblastine and maytansine. In contrast, specific
binding of radioactive rhazinilam to tubulin assembled in
microtubules was undetectable. These findings may be analogous
to our results in Fig. 3C and D that TTI-237 did not affect
either the binding of [3H]paclitaxel to or the protein content of
preformed microtubules. ()-Rhazinilam showed no in vivo
activity, probably due to CYP2B6 oxidation (34). Therefore, the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

rhazinilam structure must serve as a guide to the synthesis of more
active compounds (35).
Ceratamines A and B (33) are another class of natural product
that may be similar in action to TTI-237. These sea sponge-derived
alkaloids of relatively simple structures are considerably less potent
than TTI-237 and have not yet been shown to have in vivo
antixenograft activity. They caused a concentration-dependent
block in cell cycle progression at mitosis, and biochemical studies
with purified tubulin indicated that they directly stimulated
microtubule polymerization in the absence of MAPs. Cells treated
with ceratamines showed a dense perinuclear microtubule network
in interphase and multiple pillar-like tubulin structures in mitotic
cells. The ceratamines did not compete with paclitaxel for binding
to microtubules.
Several other synthetic small molecules have been reported to
enhance tubulin polymerization (36–40). GS-164 (36), which is not
structurally related to TTI-237, stimulated the assembly of
microtubule proteins in vitro in a concentration-dependent and
GTP-independent manner. GS-164 in the micromolar range
arrested the cell cycle of HeLa cells in the mitotic phase leading
to cell death, and it increased the amounts of cellular microtubules
in HeLa cells, resulting in the formation of microtubule bundles.
However, the binding site of GS-164 was not identified, and the
cytotoxicity of GS-164 against human tumor cells was several
hundred-fold lower than that of paclitaxel, making GS-164 itself a
lead for the synthesis of more useful compounds.
The compound reported by Mayer et al. (37) and Haggerty et al.
(41), called synstab A, polymerized microtubules from purified
tubulin. It produced microtubule bundles in interphase cells, but it
had an IC50 of f15 Amol/L in a cytoblot assay. Synstab A displaced
a fluorescently labeled paclitaxel analogue from stabilized microtubules, so it presumably was bound in the paclitaxel site.
Trapidil (Rocornal) is a name given to a triazolopyrimidine that
has been used clinically for many years (not available in the United
States and some European countries). The structure of trapidil is
5-methyl-7-diethylamino-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine, and thus,
its side chains and side chain locations are different than TTI-237.
Trapidil is reported to have a number of biological activities, but its
in vivo mechanisms of action are poorly defined. An antitubulin
activity has not been described for trapidil.
The aggregates of tubulin induced by TTI-237 have not yet
been analyzed electron microscopically to determine whether
they are real microtubules or an aberrant polymeric structure. If

TTI-237 Is a Novel Microtubule-Active Compound

TTI-237 is indeed a Vinca-site ligand and induces abnormal
nonmicrotubule polymers of tubulin as vincristine does, then
TTI-237 is unusual in that it does not cause microtubule
depolymerization as other Vinca-site ligands do, it induces
aggregation under conditions in which vincristine does not and
it would be the first fully synthetic chemotype of high potency
for this site yet described. On the other hand, TTI-237 might
bind at a novel site, distinct from the Vinca, colchicine, or
taxane sites. Interestingly, both laulimalide (42) and peloruside A
(43) induce microtubule assembly by binding to sites distinct
from the taxane site.
The immunofluorescence images in Fig. 4 suggest that TTI-237
does not grossly disrupt interphase microtubules at compound
concentrations where it has a clear effect on mitotic microtubules.
This observation may have consequences for possible toxicities in
patients. Peripheral neuropathies, important and often doselimiting side effects of some tubulin-active drugs, are thought to
be caused by the disruptive actions of these drugs on interphase
microtubules in nerve cells. Peripheral neuropathies may be
minimized in patients taking TTI-237 compared with other
microtubule-active drugs.
The sub-G1 nuclei detected by flow cytometry in Fig. 5D
probably came mainly from the multinuclear interphase cells
seen in the immunofluorescence images (Fig. 4C). The highest
frequency of multinuclear cells and the sub-G1 peak both occurred
over the same range of TTI-237 concentrations (f25–40 nmol/L).
Furthermore, in both cell cycle and immunofluorescence experiments, cells were analyzed 18 to 20 hours after compound addition.
This period of time would allow only one cycle of DNA replication
for most cells, so the maximum amount of DNA in most cells
would be a 4N amount. Multiple nuclei derived from a cell initially
having a 4N amount of DNA would, on average, have less than a

2N amount, i.e., a sub-G1 amount, of DNA. Another source of the
sub-G1 nuclei detected by flow cytometry, especially in the cases of
vincristine and colchicine, could be apoptosis. It has been reported
that the multinuclear cells produced by low concentrations of
paclitaxel undergo apoptosis (18), and apoptotic nuclear fragments
are typically found in the sub-G1 region of cell cycle histograms
(44). Further experiments will be required to determine the relative
contributions of apoptosis and fragmentation of multinuclear cells
to the sub-G1 population.
The absence of a G2-M block in cell cycle analysis (Fig. 5D) at
the concentrations of TTI-237 that caused peak levels of sub-G1
nuclei (25–40 nmol/L) is consistent with the immunofluorescence
observation that there was no increase in the mitotic index at
these same concentrations. At higher TTI-237 concentrations
(>60 nmol/L), the substantial increase in the G2-M population
agrees with the immunofluorescence observation of cells blocked
in mitosis (Fig. 4D).
In summary, TTI-237, a novel, potent, synthetic small molecule,
inhibits binding of vinblastine at the Vinca alkaloid site of the
ah-tubulin heterodimer. It enhances the aggregation of microtubule protein at substoichiometric concentrations and also induces
aggregation of highly purified tubulin in the absence of GTP. At low
concentrations with cells, TTI-237 induces mitotic spindle perturbations that do not cause mitotic block but lead to the production
of multinuclear G1 cells. TTI-237 shows good antitumor activity in
nude mouse xenograft models of human cancer.
