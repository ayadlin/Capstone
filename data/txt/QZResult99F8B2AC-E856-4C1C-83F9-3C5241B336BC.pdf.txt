Some of the most significant therapeutic advances in the treatment of cancer have occurred in the management of colorectal metastases. The introduction of new cytotoxic chemotherapeutic and biologic
agents has changed the approach to these patients from both an oncologic and a surgical perspective. In
addition, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which these agents affect tumors is developing. This molecular information will be critical in the future in designing therapeutic regimens based on an
individual tumor’s genetic profile rather than treatment for a specific tumor type. The rapidly evolving
treatment of colon cancer has provided several interesting genetic biomarkers/pathways/genes-/kinases
that have been targeted or seem to play an important role. Of particular interest is the blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with monoclonal antibodies. This treatment is efficacious when used
alone or combined with chemotherapy. However, recent data revealed that patients with tumors positive
for the K-ras mutation do not benefit from EGFR blockade. Compelling evidence has indicated that
mutated K-ras is an important oncogene involved at the early stage of the development of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, mutations in the K-ras gene have been associated with aggressive tumor biology. K-ras
mutational analysis is an important step in the overarching goal of developing personalized medicine. New
treatment strategies are needed to more effectively treat patients with the K-ras mutation. Cancer

In 2008, there will be approximately 148,810 new cases of colorectal cancer in the United States. In addition, 50,000 individuals die annually from this disease.1 The survival of colorectal cancer clearly correlates
with the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Patients with stage I disease have more than a 90% 5-year survival,
whereas the survival for metastatic disease is only about 5%.2-4 Approximately 20% of patients have stage
IV disease at their initial presentation. Over the past decade, treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer has
significantly improved with the approval of several new agents, including 3 targeted agents: bevacizumab,
cetuximab, and panitumumab. The median survival of stage IV disease has significantly increased to more
than 20 months (more recently approaching 24 months) with the addition of the newer cytotoxic and targeted biologic agents.5 Over the past several years, more research interests have been focused on identifying
patients who will benefit from these targeted therapies. This review focuses on the impact of the K-ras
mutation in the development, clinical outcomes, and treatment selection of colorectal cancer.

K-ras Gene Mutation and the Development
of Colorectal Cancer
Ras proteins are GTP-coupled proteins that are important
in many receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Activation of
Ras results in initiation of its complex signaling network.
One of the earliest defined receptor tyrosine kinase pathways is the Ras/Raf/Erk/Map kinase pathway. Activation
of the Erk/Map kinase pathway via growth factors and
their receptors ultimately leads to gene transcription and
cell proliferation. It is well established that the Erk/Map
kinase pathway plays an important role in Ras-mediated
oncogenesis.6,7 Aside from the classic Erk/Map kinase
pathway, Ras is a key activator for many other signaling
pathways leading to distinct biological effects. For
instance, both phosphainostide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) and
Ral proteins are downstream effectors of Ras.8-10 Yet, the
biological consequences are very different. The PI3 kinase/AKT pathway mainly regulates cell survival and apoptosis, while the Ral pathways may be related to cell
transformation.11,12 So far, at least 9 pathways have been
identified as the result of Ras activation.13 The complexity
of the Ras network and cross-talk between its downstream
pathways pose challenges in the development of therapeutic strategies.
Mutations in the Ras protein usually cause constitutive activation of Ras GTPase, which leads to overactivation of downstream signaling pathways, resulting in cell
transformation and tumorigenesis.14-17 Mutations in the
K-ras gene have been found in multiple human cancers
including colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers.15-18
However, the relationship of the K-ras mutation and colorectal cancer was not delineated until Fearon and Vogelstein established a stepwise hypothesis in 1990.19
The development of colorectal cancer is a multistep
process involving cumulative genetic mutations. Oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and chromosomal deletions are required to ultimately transform colonic
epithelium. Among those genes, K-ras is considered to be
critical components in the development of colorectal cancer.20-22 In clinical specimens, it has been reported that
approximately 30% to 50% of colon cancers harbor K-ras
mutations.16,17,23 Evidence also suggests that the K-ras
mutation is an early event in a subset of colorectal cancers.
For example, the K-ras mutation has been detected in precancerous aberrant crypt foci of the colonic epithelium.24,25 Furthermore, transgenic mice model expressing
3610

the mutated k-Ras protein using the colonic epithelialspecific promoter, villin 1 promoter, developed aberrant
crypt foci-like morphology throughout the colon.26 Clinically, the K-Ras mutation has been found in early adenomatus polyps.27 It has been shown that larger polyps
(> 1cm) with severe dysplastic histology usually have a
higher frequency of K-Ras mutations.27
In addition to the K-Ras mutation and silencing of
p53 and APC tumor suppressors, multiple alleic losses
(17q-, 5q- and 18q-) and epigenetic changes, such as
DNA hypermethylation, play roles in the development of
colorectal cancer.19,27-29 Fearon and Vogelstein postulated that the K-Ras mutation occurs in a preexisting small
adenoma, and through clonal expansion, it generates
larger and more dysplastic tumors. Alleic deletions likely
occur at a later stage of cancer development.19

K-ras Gene Mutation and Clinical Outcomes
The consequence of a mutated K-ras gene affects multiple
aspects of colorectal cancer. Constitutively activated K-Ras
not only promotes tumor initiation but also tumor growth,
survival, progression, local invasion, metastasis formation,
angiogenesis, and even immune response.30 The effect of
mutant K-Ras on epithelial cell proliferation is well documented.31 This is supported by the identification of K-Ras
mutations in early cancerous lesions in clinical specimens.24,25 However, it is not clear whether a K-Ras mutation is absolutely required for colorectal cancer
proliferation at later stage or in metastatic foci. In addition,
mutated K-Ras promotes angiogenesis and, in turn, aids tumor progression. The mutant K-Ras protein also has been
shown to up-regulate VEGF through the PI3 kinase pathway in human colon cancer cells.32 Clinically, antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab has proven to be effective
even in K-ras mutant colorectal cancer.33,34
Aside from tumor growth and angiogenesis, oncogenic K-Ras also plays a critical role in promoting tumor
metastasis. To invade into the local stroma or disseminate
from the primary tumor, colorectal cancer cells need to
pass through the epithelial basement membrane. Invading
colorectal cancer cells produce matrix metalloproteases
(MMPs), cysteine proteases, serine proteases, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) that break down and
facilitate migration through the basement membrane.
Yamamoto et al showed that mutated K-Ras stimulates

MMP-7 production, a determinant of metastatic potential.35 In addition, Jankun and colleagues demonstrated
that expression of activated K-Ras significantly increased
uPA release in fibroblasts.36 Mutant K-Ras is required for
high-level expression of the uPA receptor in human colorectal cancer cells.37 Buo et al revealed that the expression
of uPA and uPA receptor is often associated with tumor
local invasion in human colorectal cancers.38 Conversely,
deletion of the endogenous K-ras from HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells markedly reduced cell motility.39 On
the basis of these compelling findings, it is reasonable to
conclude that constitutively activated mutant K-ras facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis.
The relations among K-ras mutational status, tumor
stage, and survival in early studies are not very consistent.
Two large studies have been conducted to address this
question. In 1998, RASCAL I study enrolled 2721
patients and was reported by Andreyev and colleagues.23
The study showed no association of K-ras mutation with
tumor stages. However, the presence of the mutation significantly increases the risk of recurrence and death. Interestingly, the study also found that poorly differentiated
cancers less frequently had a mutated in K-ras gene (P <
.01). Subsequently, Andreyev and colleagues published
the largest study thus far, RASCAL II, in 2001.40 The
RASCAL II study collected data from 4268 patients.
From this larger cohort, 3439 patients could be evaluated
by multivariate analysis. The study demonstrated that a
codon 12 mutation, glycine to valine, had a significant
impact on disease-free survival (P ¼ .004, hazard ratio
[HR], 1.3) and overall survival (P ¼ .008, HR, 1.29).
Patients with the mutation had a much poorer prognosis.
Further evaluation revealed that this mutation had a
greater survival impact on Duke C (disease-free survival,
P ¼ .008; HR, 1.5; overall survival, P ¼ .02; HR, 1.45)
than Duke B cancers (disease-free survival, P ¼ .46, HR,
1.12; overall survival P ¼ .36; HR, 1.15). On the basis of
these 2 studies, the authors hypothesized that the presence
of the codon 12 mutation, glycine to valine, in K-ras gene
may predict a more aggressive biological behavior of the
cancer.
In addition to these 2 large studies, there are several
smaller studies that investigated the impact of the K-ras
mutational status and colorectal cancer.41-44 Some studies
showed positive relationship between K-ras mutation and
advanced stages while others did not. A common criticism

of these studies focused on the nonstandardized methods
for detection of K-ras mutations. The methods used in
these studies varied widely, which included restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), single-stranded
conformational polymorphism (SSCP), allele-specific
hybridization, and direct sequencing of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA. Recently,
Conlin et al took tumor samples from 107 patients with
colorectal cancer treated with surgery from November
1997 to December 1999 in Tayside, Scotland and subjected
them to K-ras mutation analysis. Clearly, tumors with K-ras
mutation had a significantly poorer overall survival (P ¼
.0098).45 Multivariate analysis after adjusting for stage, age,
and sex confirmed that K-ras mutation carriers had a much
higher risk of dying from their disease (HR, 2.9, confidence
interval [CI], 1.4-6.2, P ¼ .004). Interestingly, the presence
of APC and p53 mutations did not affect survival.
In 2000, Samowitz et al reported the first large US
study assessing K-ras mutation in 1413 individuals with
colon cancer.46 Approximately 32% tumor had either
codon 12 or 13 mutations. Codon 12 mutations were
found to be much more common in proximal tumors.
The study also demonstrated that the codon 12 mutation
was associated with an advanced stage of colon cancer, but
it did not correlate with cancer-related deaths. The
authors also determined that a codon 13 mutation had a
40% increase in short-term mortality from colon cancer.
This piece of data is partially consistent with the study
published by Bazan et al.47 Bazan and colleague showed
that codon 12 mutation was associated with mucinus histology, whereas codon 13 is associated with advanced
Duckes stage. Collectively, the effect of K-ras mutational
status on clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer has not been well defined. Although, there is some evidence suggesting that tumors with the K-ras mutation
may have a more aggressive biologic behavior. In addition,
the relationship between the K-ras mutation and tumor
stage is also not conclusive.

K-ras Gene Mutation and Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor Targeting
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that controls cell growth, differentiation,
and transformation. It is ubiquitously expressed in human
tissues. Upon activation of the EGFR, the receptor
3611

Review Article

undergoes dimerization and activation of its kinase activity. Subsequently, the downstream signaling cascade is
initiated, which includes activation of Ras-GTPase and
Erk/Map kinase resulting in cell proliferation. EGFR
expression is detected in up to 80% of colorectal cancers.48,49 Tumors with a high level of EGFR expression
usually have poor prognosis.50 These data have led to the
clinical use of EGFR blockade in the treatment of colorectal cancer with cetuximab. Cetuximab is a chimeric
monoclonal antibody directly against the extra cellular domain of the EGFR and blocks the signal cascade through
the EGFR. In 2004, Cunningham et al showed that addition of cetuximab to irinotecan achieved a 20% response
rate (RR) in irinotecan-refractory patients. This suggests
that cetuximab can overcome irinotecan resistance.51 Similarly the CRYSTAL trial published by Van Cutsem and
colleagues, demonstrated a significant increase in response
rate when cetuximab was combined with FOFIRI in the
first-line setting (38.7% for FOLFIRI; 46.9% for cetuximab þ FOLFIRI; P ¼ .0038).52 This higher response rate
also translated into a superior progression-free survival
(progression-free survival, HR ¼ 0.637, 95% CI, 0.4320.941, P ¼ .023).
As K-Ras is the downstream effector of EGFR and it
is frequently mutated in colorectal cancer, the effectiveness of cetuximab in K-ras mutated tumors has become a
topic of many recent studies. One of the initial reports
came from Personeni and colleagues at the 2007 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.53 In their study, the
authors demonstrated that an increasing copy number of
EGFR in colorectal cancer by FISH analysis predicted the
response to cetuximab. However, tumors with the K-ras
mutation did not respond to cetuximab therapy. This observation was further confirmed by several studies presented at 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) annual meeting.54,55 In a recently published
report, De Roock et al found that K-ras mutations precluded tumor response to cetuximab.55,56 However, all of
these studies suffered from small patient cohorts.
Recently, 2 large studies were published correlating K-ras
mutations with the efficacy of cetuximab and panitumumab. Amado and colleagues examined K-ras mutations in
427 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
panitumumab or best supportive care.57 Patients with
wild-type K-ras clearly benefited from panitumumab with
a significantly longer progression-free survival and overall
3612

survival. However, this benefit diminished in57 patients
with mutant K-ras. Hence, the authors recommend that
K-ras mutational analysis should be perfomed before initiating panitumumab therapy. Similar results were demonstrated by Karapetis and colleagues.58 A total of 394
tumor samples from patients treated with cetuximab or
best supportive care were tested for the K-ras mutation.
Their results supported the finding that patients with Kras mutations did not benefit from cetuximab treatment.
The relation between the K-ras mutational status
and the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy was further assessed
by several other groups who reported similar results at the
2008 Gastrointestinal Cancer Symposium and the ASCO
annual meeting.57,59-61 Van Cutsem and colleagues performed a retrospective study to assess K-ras mutational
status in patients who participated in the CRYSTAL
trial.62 In this study, 348 patients (64.4%) had wild-type
K-ras, while 192 patients (35.6%) had mutant K-ras. In
patients with wild-type K-ras, cetuximab significantly
improved the response rate (43% for FOLFIRI, 59% for
cetuximab þ FOLFIRI, P ¼ .0025) and progression-free
survival (8.7 months for FOLFIRI, 9.9 months for cetuximab þ FOLFIRI, P ¼ .017). However, cetuximab had no
effect on tumors bearing the K-ras mutation (RR: 40%
without cetuximab vs 36% with cetuximab, P ¼ .46; progression-free survival: 8.1 months without cetuximab vs
7.6 months with cetuximab, P ¼ .75). This observation
was confirmed by another large retrospective study presented by Bokeneyer et al in the OPUS study.61 In the
OPUS study, patients with EFGR-expressing metastatic
colorectal cancer were randomized to receive FOLOFX4
or cetuximab plus FOLFOX4. The K-ras mutation was
correlated with RR and progression-free survival. Bokemeyer and colleagues found that the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX4 significantly increases RR in K-ras
wild-type tumors (37% without cetuximab vs 61% with
cetuximab, P ¼ .011). This enhanced RR was not
observed in K-ras mutant tumors (49% without cetuximab vs 33% with cetuximab, P ¼ .106). Similarly,
patients with wild-type K-ras benefited from cetuximab
with a better progression-free survival (7.7 months with
cetuximab vs 7.2 months without cetuximab, P ¼ .016).
Surprisingly, cetuximab had a detrimental effect on progression-free survival in patients with K-ras mutation (5.5
months with cetuximab vs 8.6 months without cetuximab, P ¼ .0192). Similar results were reported by Tejpar

and colleagues in the EVEREST.63 In that study, the
authors tried to address the relationship between development of skin rash, K-ras mutation and the efficacy of
cetuximab. Patients were initially treated with standard
dose (400 mg/m2 loading dose followed by weekly
250mg/m2) cetuximab with irinotecan. Those with grade
0 of 1 skin rash were further randomized to receive standard dose of cetuximab (250 mg/m2 weekly) or dose escalation of cetuximab (increase by 50 mg/m2 every 2 weeks).
The authors were able to demonstrate that patients with
Cancer

August 15, 2009

wild-type K-ras benefited from cetuximab dose escalation.
Overall, progression-free survival was found to be better
in K-ras wild-type population (173 days for wild-type vs
83 days for mutant, P < .0001). The development of
cetuximab related rash was an independent predictor for
cetuximab. The results from these studies will undoubtedly change our current practice pattern. The results of
these trials are summarized in Table 1.

treatment to more accurately guide their therapy. Figure 1
is a proposed algorithm to stratify patients based on their
K-ras mutational status. Cetuximab should be offered
only to those with wild-type K-ras. Similarly, Amado and
colleagues have demonstrated that panitumumab, a fully
humanized monoclonal antibody to EGFR, exhibits efficacy only in wild-type K-ras tumors.57 Hence, the use of
panitumumab should be restricted to patients with K-ras
wild- type tumors.
Numerous additional genetic mutations are presently being investigated to tailor therapy to these specific
gene alterations. One such gene that has similar implications is PTEN. Loupakis and colleagues examined the
expression of PTEN and K-ras mutation in metastatic
colorectal cancers to correlate with the response to cetuximab and irinotecan treatment.64 The authors demonstrated that patients with tumors expressing PTEN and
wild-type K-ras had a better prognosis and higher
response rate. One possible mechanism is that the loss of
3614

PTEN leads to activation of PI3 kinase/AKT pathway
which inhibits cell apoptosis triggered by cytotoxic agents or
cetuximab. An additional piece of evidence came from a
preclinical study in prostate cancer in which C4-2 Cap, a
prostate cancer cell line deficient of PTEN, was investigated.
This cell line is essentially resistant to EGFR inhibitors such
as gefitinib and lapatinib. However, restoration of PTEN in
C4-2 Cap cells resensitized cells to EGFR inhibitors.65
Most recently, mutations in other signaling molecules
along Ras/Raf/Map kinase pathway have been explored. In
2002, Davies et al identified gain-of-function BRaf mutations in colorectal cancer and melanoma.66 All point mutations occurred within the kinase domain of BRaf protein
leading to constitutive activation of BRaf kinase. Ras is not
required for the activated BRaf-induced transformation in
NIH 3T3 cells. After Davies’ discovery, several other groups
also evaluated BRaf mutations specifically in colorectal cancer. A French study published by Barault et al identified a
13.3% BRaf mutation rate in a cohort of 586 patients.
Unlike the K-ras mutation, mutations in BRaf frequently
occurred in females, patients older than 75 years of age,
proximal lesions, and tumors with higher frequency of
microsatellite instability.67 These important discoveries
opened up more questions. Are K-ras and BRaf mutations
mutually exclusive in colorectal cancer? What is the efficacy
of EGFR-blocking therapy in colorectal cancers with BRaf
mutations? And finally, are currently available BRaf inhibitors such as sorafenib effective in colorectal cancers with the
BRaf mutation?
These breakthrough findings on the molecular
mechanisms of cancers are changing not only our current
practice paradigm but also the traditional method by
which clinical trials are designed in this new era of molecular medicine. Clinical trials involving certuximab have all
undergone modifications in the randomization strategies
based on the K-ras mutation status. CALGB 80,405, a
phase 3 study assessing cetuximab and bevacizumab in
combination with either FOFOX or FOLFIRI as a firstline therapy, will randomize patients based on their K-ras
mutational status. The SWOG/NCCTG study evaluating
the continuation of bevacizumab versus cetuximab in the
second-line setting will also stratify patients using K-ras
analysis. Finally, ECOG-N0147/NCCTG-N0147, an adjuvant trial for stage III colon cancer, will adopt the same
strategy. We propose an algorithm in the management of
metastatic colorectal cancer as illustrated in Figure 2.

Conclusions
K-ras genetic testing is an important development in the
treatment of colorectal cancer. Numerous other genes are
currently being studied to further define the role of specific targeted therapies. Molecular profiling of individual
tumors, an in-depth understanding of cancer genomics,
and epigenomic alterations will lead to more effective
therapies in the near future. The individualization of therapy for a particular patient will be a revolution in the
treatment of cancer patients when its potential is fully
explored and recognized in the upcoming era of personalized medicine.
