Abstract
As the pathophysiology of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
involves a block of myeloid maturation, a desirable therapeutic strategy is to induce leukemic cell maturation to
increase the efficacy and to avoid the side effects of traditional
chemotherapeutics. Through a compound library screen,
6-benzylthioinosine (6BT) was identified as a promising
differentiation-inducing agent. 6BT induces monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines such as HL-60 and
OCI-AML3, as well as primary patient samples as evidenced by
morphology, immunophenotyping, and nitroblue tetrazolium
reduction. Not only can 6BT induce differentiation but a
subset of AML cell lines such as MV4-11 and HNT34 instead
undergo 6BT-mediated cell death. Despite inducing cell death
in some leukemic cells, 6BT exhibits extremely low toxicity on
several nonmalignant cells such as fibroblasts, normal bone
marrow, and endothelial cells. This toxicity profile may relate
to the function of 6BT as an inhibitor of the nucleoside
transporter, ent1, which is thought to prevent it from entering
many cell types. In contrast, 6BT likely enters at least some
leukemic cell lines as shown by its requirement for phosphorylation for its differentiation activity. 6BT is also able to
synergize with currently used myeloid differentiation agents
such as ATRA and decitabine. Early studies indicate that the
mechanism of action of this compound may involve ATP
depletion that leads to growth inhibition and subsequent
differentiation. Besides in vitro activity, 6BT also shows the
ability to impair HL-60 and MV4-11 tumor growth in nude
mice. 6BT is a promising new monocytic differentiation agent
with apparent leukemic cell–specific activity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of
acute leukemia in adults with >13,000 cases expected in the United
States this year (1).7 Despite advances in treatment, the 5-year
survival is still only 33% in patients under the age of 65 years and
4% in patients >65 years (2).7 The poor efficacy of the current AML
therapeutics may be due to the pathophysiology of AML as it is
characterized by the arrest of differentiation of immature myeloid
cells and rapidly dividing cells. Unfortunately, the current AML

chemotherapeutics such as cytarabine and idarubicin primarily
target the highly proliferative cells.
In contrast to the poor prognosis for the majority of patients
with AML, the use of differentiation therapy for a rare subtype of
AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 5–10% of AML),
illustrates the promise of differentiation therapy for AML. In
APL, the use of the differentiation-inducing agent all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA) has revolutionized the treatment of APL and leads to
the long-term survival and presumed cure of 75% to 85% of
patients (3). By inducing myeloid leukemia cells to terminally
differentiate, ATRA is able to successfully treat APL in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents without additional cytotoxicity. The use of ATRA is especially advantageous in the elderly as
this population often cannot tolerate induction chemotherapy. By
using therapies that include ATRA and low-dose chemotherapy, the
elderly can achieve long-term survival. ATRA illustrates the great
potential of differentiation-inducing agents for other subtypes of
AML as they may provide comparable or greater efficacy and less
toxicity than the currently used chemotherapeutics.
Although a wide range of myeloid differentiation-inducing
compounds have been reported, few of them have shown clinical
efficacy in treating AML. The most commonly used agents, ATRA
and arsenic trioxide, have been found to be clinically useful only
for AML patients with the rare APL subtype. In an attempt to
discover potential clinically useful differentiation-inducing compounds, a cell-based, small compound library screen was performed that was intentionally biased to select relatively nontoxic
compounds with high activity. We identified one particularly promising novel compound, 6-benzylthioinosine (6BT) through this
screen. In this article, we show that not only does 6BT exhibit
high myeloid differentiation–inducing activity in at least a subset
of leukemic cells, but its putative mechanisms of action also
highlight specific pathways that may be exploited in developing
future leukemia therapeutics. Further the identification of
differentiation-inducing compounds such as 6BT illustrates the
potential of the devised compound library screen in identifying
novel differentiation compounds with potential clinical utility.

Cell lines. HL-60 and MV-411 cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. OCI-AML3, HNT-34, and OCIM2 cells were obtained
from DSMZ. Patient samples were obtained from the stem cell core facility
at University Hospitals Case Medical Center. MEF and human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were kindly provided from the
laboratory of Dr. Mary Laughlin (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH). Cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
(Invitrogen) except for MEF (DMEM; Invitrogen) and HUVEC (EGM Lonza).
Medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen),
penicillin G (100 Ag/mL), and streptomycin (100 Ag/mL). Mononuclear cells
were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) density-gradient centrifugation,
and for selected patients, leukemic myeloblasts were isolated by flow
sorting after staining with anti-CD34 PE (Becton Dickinson).
Cell proliferation and viability. Cell proliferation was assessed by
manual counting cells with a hematocytometer. Cell viability was assessed
by the trypan blue dye exclusion method.
Compound library screen. For screening, 100 AL of HL-60 cells (5 
105 cells/mL) were cultured in 96-well plates. Cells were treated with
10 Amol/L of compounds from the following libraries: Lopac (Sigma),
Prestwick (Prestwick Chemical), and NCI diversity collection. DMSO (0.1%)
and ATRA (1 Amol/L) were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively. After 5 d, the differentiation of the cells was assessed by the
NBT reduction assay. To perform the NBT assay, 20 AL of a solution of NBT
(5 mg/mL) and PMA 100 ng/mL (as a stimulant of the respiratory burst)
were added to the HL-60 cells. The cells were incubated at 37jC for 30 min
and the color of the wells was assessed. Those wells that displayed a visual
color change from the production of blue insoluble formazan greater than
the negative control were examined microscopically to determine the
percentage of blue cells. At least 200 cells were counted for each positive well.
Differentiation. NBT reduction was performed in a similar manner as
described for the compound library screen. Immunophenotyping was
performed by costaining cells with CD11b-PE and CD14-FITC (Becton
Dickinson). The stained samples were run on a Beckman Coulter Cytomics
FC 500 cytometer. For morphology assessment, cytospin preparations were
made using a Shandon cytospin3 cytocentrifuge, and the slides were stained
with a modified wright-giemsa stain.
Soft agar clonogenic assay. HL-60 cells (2  105 cells/mL) were treated
with 6BT or vehicle for 3 d. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and 3,000
cells were dissolved in 3 mL of 0.35% Soft Agar (Noble Agar; Sigma)
supplemented with 20% FBS. The cells were incubated for 10 d in 37jC in a
5% CO2 incubator. After 10 d, the colonies were counted under a light
microscope.
Cell cycle analysis. HL-60 cells were treated with 6BT or vehicle for 3 d.
Cells were fixed overnight at 20jC in methanol. Cells were washed in PBS,
treated with RNase A ( final concentration, 0.5 Ag/mL; Sigma), and stained
with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL). The cells were kept at 4jC for 30 to
60 min and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells treated with
6BT or vehicle at indicated time points, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the Enhanced Avian RT First Strand
Synthesis kit (Sigma). Relative quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate
using the FastStart SYBR Green Master (Roche Diagnostics) on an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-TimePCR System. The primers used were
CEBP/h5¶ primer, 5¶-GAACAGCAACGAGTACCGGGTG-3¶, and 3¶ primer,
5¶-CCCATGGCCTTGACCAAGGAG-3¶; b-actin 5¶primer, 5¶-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3¶, and 3¶primer, 5¶-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3¶;
c-myc 5¶ primer, 5¶-GCCACGTCTCCACACATCAG-3¶, and 3¶ primer,
5¶-TCTTGGCAGCAGGATAGTCCTT-3¶. Thermal conditions of the system
were as follows: 95jC for 5 min, 40 cycles at 95jC for 15 s, 55jC for 45 s, and
72jC for 1 min.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed with p21 (Cell
Signaling), bcl-2 (Santa Cruz biotechnology), and h-actin antibodies (Sigma).
Cells were treated with 6BT or vehicle for the indicated times and washed in
PBS. Cells were centrifuged and lysed with a Triton containing lysis buffer.
Protein lysates (80 Ag per lane) were electrophoresed on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The
membranes were blocked, incubated with the indicated primary antibodies
at 4jC overnight, and then the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized by autoradiography after incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).
Mouse xenograft. Six-wk-old male nude mice were injected bilaterally
s.c. with 5  106 HL-60 or MV-411 cells. Drug treatment was started 10 d or
1 d after tumor cell injection for the established tumor or tumor formation
models, respectively. Palpable tumors were present for the established
tumor model before initiating drug treatment. 6BT or vehicle (150 mg/kg)
was injected i.p. daily for 5 d and then 3 d a week for 2 wk for both model
systems. Vehicle consisted of 20 AL of DMSO and 80 AL of peanut oil. The
Case Western Reserve University Animal Research Committee approved all
of the animal protocols used in this study.
ATP measurement. Cells were treated with vehicle or 6BT for the
indicated times, and the relative ATP concentration was measured using
the ATPlite 1step kit (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturers
recommendations. Briefly, after the indicated treatment time cells were
washed in PBS and resuspended in RPMI at a concentration of 3  103
viable (trypan blue negative) cells per mL. Cells (100 AL) were mixed with
100 AL of ATPlite 1step reagent in a 96-well plate, and the luminescence was
measured using a Spectramax L luminometer (Molecular Devices).

Figure 2. 6BT induces monocyte/
macophage differentiation of HL-60 cells.
A, 6BT induces morphologic changes

reduction activity consistent with
myelomonocytic differentiation. HL-60 cells
were treated with the indicated compounds
for 4 d and then the NBT reduction assay
was performed. The percentage of
NBT-positive cells was calculated by
counting at least 200 cells under a light
microscope. Results are an average of
three independent experiments. D, 6BT
induces the monocytic transcription
factor CEBP/b and down-regulates the
transcription factor c-myc . HL-60 cells
were treated for the indicated number of
days with vehicle or 10 Amol/L 6BT. The
relative expression of CEBP/b and c-myc
was determined by real-time PCR.

screen assessed differentiation by measuring the functional
maturation of HL-60 leukemic cells by the NBT reduction assay,
a test that is highly specific to and has been used extensively as a
measure of functional myelomonocytic differentiation (4–8). The
NBT reduction test measures the ability of cells to generate a
respiratory burst, a function that is only present in differentiated
cells. From this screen, 4 novel compounds (as well as 8 known
compounds), with at least 75% of the NBT reduction activity of the
positive control, ATRA, were identified (Fig. 1A). All four novel
compounds exhibit chemical structures unrelated to ATRA
(Fig. 1B).
6BT can induce myeloid differentiation. One compound in
particular, 6BT, exhibits clinical potential. 6BT induces differentiation of HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells as shown by morphology,
immunophenotyping, and NBT reduction (Fig. 2). Clear morphologic monocyte/macrophage differentiation is shown by such
features as condensed nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and vacuoles
(Fig. 2A). In addition, 6BT induces cells to adhere to the tissue
culture plate. Immunophenotyping with CD11b, which is upregulated during myelomonocytic differentiation, and CD14, which
is up-regulated primarily during monocytic differentiation, further
confirms the differentiation pathway. ATRA, which induces
granulocytic differentiation, induces primarily CD11b expression,
whereas 6BT and vitamin D3, which induce monocytic differentiation, lead to up-regulation of both CD11b and CD14 expression
(Fig. 2B). 6BT exhibits similar differentiation-inducing activity to
the highly active differentiation agents ATRA and vitamin D3 as
measured by NBT reduction with 6BT differentiating 97% F 1.9%,
ATRA differentiating 95% F 1.7%, and Vitamin D3 differentiating
91% F 4.6% of HL-60 cells (Fig. 2C).
To further examine the ability of 6BT to induce myeloid
differentiation, its effects on the transcription factors CEBP/b

www.aacrjournals.org

and c-myc that are regulated during myeloid differentiation were
examined (Fig. 2D). Consistent with monocytic differentiation, the
expression of the monocytic transcription factor CEBP/b was upregulated almost 10-fold compared with vehicle-treated cells at
5 days after treatment with 6BT. Also supportive of the induction of
myeloid differentiation, the expression of the proliferation-related
transcription factor c-myc is rapidly down-regulated after 6BT
treatment.
6BT induces terminal differentiation. To assess the ability of
6BT to affect leukemic cell growth, its effects on HL-60 cell
proliferation were measured. 6BT led to a significant inhibition of
HL-60 cell growth compared with the vehicle control. At the doses
used, 6BT induces even more growth inhibition than ATRA (30% F
7.1% versus 58% F 6.5% of vehicle-treated cells; Fig. 3A). To
determine the mechanism of growth inhibition, cell cycle analysis
was performed. 6BT growth inhibition involves accumulation of
cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle with >80% of cells present
in G0-G1 compared with 55% in the vehicle control at 72 hours after
treatment (Fig. 3B). Consistent with accumulation in the G0-G1
phase, 6BT induces p21 that plays a critical role in preventing the
G1 to S transition by inhibiting the cyclinD–cyclin-dependent
kinase 4/6 complex and down-regulates bcl-2 that among other
functions is involved in leukemic cell proliferation (Fig. 3C). To
assess whether the observed 6BT-mediated growth inhibition and
differentiation results in terminal differentiation, colony forming
assays were performed in soft agar. Limited exposure (72 hours) of
HL-60 cells to 6BT at doses of 5 and 10 Amol/L almost completely
prevented colony growth in soft agar, demonstrating that terminal
differentiation can be induced at low noncytotoxic concentrations
(Fig. 3D).
6BT induces differentiation or cell death in multiple
leukemic cell lines and primary patient samples. In addition

Figure 3. 6BT has growth inhibitory effects
on HL-60 cells. A, 6BT inhibits the proliferation
of HL-60 cells. Cells were treated with the
indicated compounds for 5 d, and the number
of cells present at specific time points was
assessed by counting at least 200 cells with a
hematocytometer. Results shown represent
the number of 6BT-treated cells present
divided by the number of vehicle-treated cells
at specific time points and are an average of

induces alterations of the cell cycle. HL-60
cells were treated with the indicated
compounds for 3 d, and the cells were stained
with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Results are representative of three
independent experiments. C, 6BT leads to the
up-regulation of p21 and down-regulation of
Bcl-2. HL-60 cells were treated with the
indicated compounds for 1, 3, or 5 d, and
Western blot analysis was performed on the
same membrane with p21, Bcl-2, and
h-actin antibodies. D, 6BT inhibits colony
formation in soft agar. HL-60 cells were
incubated with 6BT or vehicle for 72 h, and the
drug was washed off. An equal number of
viable cells were added to soft agar, and
colony formation was assessed after 10 d.

to HL-60 cells (AML-M2), we assessed the ability of 6BT to induce
myeloid differentiation in leukemic cells representing different
AML subtypes including OCI-AML3 (AML-M4), HNT34 (AML-M4),
MV-411 (AML-M5), and OCIM2 (AML-M6) cells as well as several

primary leukemic patient samples. Similar to HL-60 cells, OCIAML3 cells underwent monocyte/macrophage differentiation in
response to 6BT as measured by morphology, NBT reduction, and

significantly up-regulated in OCI-AML3 cells, suggesting monocytic
differentiation. In contrast, ATRA treatment leads to granulocytic
differentiation and only up-regulates CD11b, whereas Vitamin D3
also leads to monocytic differentiation.
Surprisingly, in contrast to OCI-AML3 cells, both HNT34 and
MV-411 cells undergo cell death to low concentrations of 6BT with
an LD50 at 5 days of 0.5 and 2 Amol/L for these cell lines,
respectively. In contrast, the LD50 at 5 days for OCIAML3 and HL60 cells is >100 and 30 Amol/L, respectively. Subtoxic concentrations of 6BT do not induce evidence of differentiation in HNT34
or MV-411 cells (data not shown). The OCIM2 cells did not respond
to up to 30 Amol/L of 6BT by differentiation or cell death (data not
shown). Besides leukemic cell lines, 6BT can also induce myeloid
differentiation and, in some cases, cell death of primary leukemic
patient samples. Of five leukemic samples tested, two showed
evidence of differentiation (AML-M4 and chronic myelogenous
leukemia), two different patient samples showed 6BT-mediated cell
death (AML-M2 and AML-M4), and one sample seemed nonresponsive (AML-M5; Fig. 4B). One of the two patient samples that
exhibited 6BT-mediated differentiation is from a patient with the
closely related myeloid disorder, chronic myeloid leukemia in blast

crisis, indicating the possible utility of 6BT in this disease as well.
The other patient sample is derived from a patient with AML-M4
with relapsed leukemia. This patient sample let to dramatic
morphologic changes characterized by attachment of the vast
majority of leukemic cells to the tissue culture plate as well as an
increase in NBT reduction activity (Fig. 4B). Both patient samples
that exhibited cell death showed >90% dead cells as shown by
morphology and trypan blue dye exclusion after 6BT treatment
(Fig. 4B).
As 6BT induces differentiation activity and/or cell death against
leukemic cell lines and patient samples at low micromolar
concentrations, the potential toxicity of 6BT against nonmalignant
cell types was assessed. Of particular note, the LD50 of 6BT on
normal human bone marrow cells is >100 Amol/L, which was the
highest dose tested. Similarly, the LD50 was >100 Amol/L for the
other cell types examined including human umbilical vein
endothelial cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human
mononuclear cells (Fig. 4C).
6BT synergizes with other chemotherapy agents in treating
leukemic cells. We also investigated if 6BT has synergistic effects
on leukemic cells in combination with agents that have been

Figure 4. 6BT has differentiation and specific cell death activity in multiple AML cell lines and patient samples, and can synergize with clinically used therapeutics.
A, 6BT induces monocytic differentiation of OCI-AML3 cells. Cells were treated with 6BT for 4 d and assessed for differentiation by morphology, immunophenotyping,
and NBT reduction as described in Fig. 2. B, 6BT can induce differentiation or cell death in primary patient samples. Primary leukemic blasts were purified by
flow sorting after staining with CD34-PE. Cells were treated with 6BT (10 Amol/L) for up to 10 d and assessed for differentiation by morphology and NBT reduction and
cell death by trypan blue dye exclusion as described in Fig. 2. An exception is that the photograph of the primary AML-M4 patient sample was unstained and taken
directly from the tissue culture plate. C, 6BT exhibits low in vitro toxicity. The indicated cell lines were treated with up to 100 Am of 6BT for 5 d, and the LD50
was determined. Results represent three independent experiments. D, 6BT can synergize in HL-60 cells with ATRA, decitabine, and cytarabine. To assess ATRA and
decitabine synergy, HL-60 cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 4 d, and the NBT reduction assay was performed as described in Fig. 2. Results
are representative of three independent experiments. To assess cytarabine synergy, cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 72 h and viable cells were
assessed by trypan blue staining. Results are an average of three independent experiments. Cyt, cytarabine; dox, doxorubicin.

clinically used in the treatment of AML. 6BT can synergize with
decitabine (a hypomethylating agent used for myelodysplastic
syndrome and AML) and low doses of ATRA to induce
differentiation, indicating these compounds likely work through
different pathways (Fig. 4D). Cotreatment of HL-60 cells with a low
dose of 6BT (1 Amol/L) led to an increase in NBT reduction from
20% with 6BT alone to 77% with decitabine (100 ng/mL) and 89%
with ATRA (250 nmol/L).
In addition, 6BT was tested for its ability to enhance cytarabinemediated cell death. The currently used AML chemotherapeutic,
cytarabine, is a nucleoside analogue known to primarily use the
ent1 nucleoside transporter to enter and exit cells (9). As 6BT is a
potent ent1 inhibitor, the ability of 6BT to inhibit or synergize with
cytarabine-mediated leukemia cell killing was assessed. 6BT was
found to significantly augment cytarabine-mediated HL-60 cell death.
After 48 hours of treatment with cytarbine alone (400 nmol/L),
68.8% F 9.9% of cells were alive compared with only 26.6% F 8.8%
after cotreatment with 6BT. Another chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, which does not depend upon ent1, did not show synergy with
6BT (Fig. 4D). This result reveals the potential that ent1 may be a
desirable drug target for combination therapies with cytarabine or
other nucleoside analogues that primarily use ent1.
6BT shows high activity in mouse xenograft experiments.
Mouse AML xenograft models were used to determine the in vivo
activity of 6BT. First, 6BT was assessed for its ability to inhibit the
growth of established HL-60 s.c. tumors in nude mice. In the
established tumor model, tumors were significantly smaller after
6BT treatment (150 mg/kg) compared with vehicle-treated mice
(0.16 grams F 0.05 grams versus 0.73 grams F 0.28 grams; Fig. 5A–B).
Flow cytometric analysis of the dissected tumors (n = 3) at the
end of the study period shows evidence of the induction of the
mature myeloid marker CD11b (27.7% F 1.5% in the vehicle and
63.3% F 6.4% in the 6BT-treated tumors). Surprisingly, there was no
difference in CD14 expression between the tumors in the 6BT and
vehicle mice.
In the second model system, the ability of 6BT to prevent either
HL-60 or MV-411 tumor formation in nude mice was assessed. In
this model, 6BT treatment initiated 1 day after leukemic cell
inoculation completely prevented tumor formation of both
leukemic cell types in all five mice tested for each cell line with
bilateral tumor cell inoculations (Fig. 5C). Therefore, as a single
agent, 6BT exhibits in vivo activity.
Phosphorylation of 6BT is required for differentiation
induction. To begin to elucidate the mechanism of 6BT-mediated
differentiation induction, a closely related compound 6-methylthioinosine (6MT) was used as a model. 6BT is nearly identical in
chemical structure to 6MT except for substitution of a methyl
group for the benzyl group. As 6MT is monophosphorylated by
adenosine kinase, the role of phosphorylation in 6BT activity was
assessed (10). Phosphorylation of 6BT is required for its
differentiation activity as there is complete loss of 6BT-mediated
differentiation induction of HL-60 cells with coincubation of
1 nmol/L of the specific adenosine kinase inhibitor, 5-iodotubericin
(Fig. 6A). The requirement of 6BT phosphorylation for its activity
also provides strong evidence that it enters leukemic cells.
6BT depletes ATP stores in HL-60 cells. Because monophosphorylated 6MT is known to act as a potent inhibitor of the
enzyme amidophosphoribosyltransferase, the first committed step
in de novo purine synthesis, the ability of 6BT to deplete ATP, was
assessed (11). 6BT was found to potently deplete ATP stores in HL60 cells (Fig. 6B). Treatment of HL-60 cells with 6BT (5 Amol/L)

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (11). June 1, 2008

leads to rapid depletion of f70% of ATP stores within 24 hours.
The depletion of ATP is not due to the differentiation process itself
as, after 6BT treatment, HL-60 cells contain 30.3% F 9.2% of the
ATP levels of vehicle-treated cells compared with 93.0% F 9.1% in
ATRA-treated cells (1 Amol/L). Although 6BT does induce growth
arrest of HL-60 cells and the cells ultimately die, the time course of
significant cell death (f7 days) and ATP depletion (hours) is
significantly different. 6BT was also found to deplete ATP in OCIAML3 cells (50–60% at 24 hours) but did not lead to significant
ATP depletion, at least at early time points, in MV411 cells that
undergo 6BT-mediated cell death instead of differentiation. Due to
the induction of cell death in MV411 cells, it was not possible to
assess the ATP depletion at 24 hours.
6BT may use a non-ent1 transporter to enter leukemic cells.
To begin to elucidate how 6BT may enter leukemic cells, wellcharacterized nucleoside transporter inhibitors were used. Neither
nitrobenzylthioinsoine (NBTI) nor dipyridamole was able to block
low-dose 6BT-mediated differentiation of HL-60 cells at optimal
doses for the inhibition of ent1 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, when NBTI
was used at an extremely high concentration (10 Amol/L) that is
capable of inhibiting several other nucleoside transporters, a

6-Benzylthioinosine Induces Myeloid Differentiation

Figure 6. Mechanism by which 6BT can
induce differentiation. A, phosphorylation
of 6BT is essential for its activity. HL-60
cells were treated with 6BT alone or in
combination with the specific adenosine
kinase inhibitor, 5 iodotubericidin for 4 d,
and the NBT reduction assay was
performed as described in Fig. 2. Results
are an average of three independent
experiments. B, 6BT potently depletes ATP
stores in leukemic cells. HL-60, OCI-AML3,
and MV411 cells were treated for the
indicated time points with 6BT, ATRA, or
vehicle. An equal number of viable
(as measured by trypan blue) cells was
assessed for ATP using a luciferase-based
assay system. The results shown
represent the amount of ATP in the treated
groups as a percentage of the ATP
present in the vehicle-treated group.
Results are an average of three
independent experiments. C, inhibition of
ent1 does not block 6BT-mediated
uptake into leukemic cells. HL-60 cells
were treated with the indicated compounds
with or without a low dose of 6BT (5 Amol/L)
for 3 d, and the NBT reduction assay
was performed as detailed in Fig. 2.
Results are an average of three
independent experiments.

dramatic decrease in 6BT-mediated differentiation was observed
(86% F 9.6%–25% F 13.20%). Therefore, 6BT is likely capable of
entering leukemic cells through a nonent1–mediated pathway that
is at least partially inhibited by NBTI. It is well-established that
leukemic cells can express nucleoside transporters not widely
expressed on other cells (12).

Discussion
We identified a novel myeloid differentiation-inducing compound, 6BT, through a small compound library screen. This
compound induces monocyte/macrophage differentiation in a
subset of leukemia cell lines and patient samples. The mechanism
of action of this compound may involve the depletion of ATP stores
that leads to growth inhibition and subsequent differentiation.

Besides differentiation induction, a subset of leukemic cell lines
and patient samples instead undergo 6BT-mediated cell death at
significantly lower concentrations (>100-fold) than required to
induce similar cell death in several nonmalignant cells including
normal human bone marrow cells. It is possible that this cell death
pathway is mediated through an unknown mechanism that does
not involve ATP depletion. We have also shown that 6BT can
inhibit leukemic tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.
The successful use of differentiation therapy for AML has been
clearly shown by the remarkable success of ATRA in 5% to 10% of
AML patients. As ATRA targets retinoic acid receptor a and induces
granulocytic differentiation, the mechanism of action of 6BT is likely
significantly different as it may target ATP depletion and induces
monocytic differentiation. Although many other differentiationinducing compounds have been described previously, the vast

majority are not therapeutic candidates due to suboptimal
differentiation activity, inability to induce terminal differentiation,
poor drug-like properties, or unacceptable toxicities. One notable
example is Vitamin D, which is a potent monocytic differentiationinducing agent but leads to toxic hypercalcemia at the required
dosages (13). Although 6BT is early in development, it can induce
almost the complete differentiation of some leukemic cell lines as
well as at least one of the limited number of patient samples tested,
and also force leukemic cells to terminally mature to a point where
they lose their proliferative capacity.
6BT has several intriguing properties that support its further
preclinical development. The apparent favorable toxicity profile of
6BT may directly relate to its well-characterized activity as an
inhibitor of ent1 (14). The ability to inhibit ent1 may also
contribute to its capacity to synergize with cytarabine to induce
leukemic cell death. Although not previously shown with
cytarabine or leukemic cells, it has been shown for other
chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that inhibition
of nucleoside transporters with dipyridamole can enhance cell
killing by preventing the efflux of a 5-FU metabolite (15). This
finding opens up the attractive possibility of using lower doses of
cytarabine that may have increased efficacy and more tolerability.
Future studies will address whether the ability of 6BT to inhibit
ent1 is directly related to its ability to synergize with cytarabine to
kill HL-60 cells. It will also be important to assess if ent1 inhibition
leads to enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy with unacceptable
toxicities.
Interestingly, a portion of the leukemic cell lines tested that do
not undergo 6BT-mediated differentiation undergo cell death in
response to concentrations of 6BT that are at least 100 times lower
than those required to induce equivalent death in nontumorderived cell types such as fibroblasts, human endothelial cells, and
normal human bone marrow cells (LD50 values of f1 Amol/L
versus >100 Amol/L). Despite the ability of 6BT to induce leukemic
cell death or differentiation, the mouse models show that 6BT can
be effective in vivo against leukemic cells that respond to 6BT by
either differentiation (HL-60) or cell death (MV-411). Interestingly,
6BT led to the up-regulation of the mature myeloid marker CD11b
but not CD14 in tumors. It is possible that that pathway of
differentiation is different in vivo as it is likely influenced by various
cytokines and growth factors.

Previous studies by El Kouni et al. (16) have suggested that 6BT
does not normally enter mammalian cells, and the lack of its
uptake seems to be related to its potent activity as an inhibitor of
the nucleoside transporter, ent1. Interestingly, this group has
studied 6BT as a potential therapeutic for Toxoplasma gondii
infection as 6BT can be selectively transported by Toxoplasmainfected mammalian cells by using the Toxoplasma adenosine/
purine transporter. The lack of uptake of 6BT into many
mammalian cells likely explains the apparent favorable toxicity
profile of 6BT. Consistent with our results, El Kouni et al. reported
that 6BT and related analogues exhibit low toxicity using human
fibroblasts.
In contrast to many mammalian cells, 6BT likely can enter
leukemic cells as evidenced by its dependence on phosphorylation
for its activity. As it is well-known that leukemic cells express
nucleoside transporters not widely expressed on other cell types,
it is possible that 6BT is using one of these transporters to enter
leukemic cells. The identification of the 6BT transport mechanism
may help to explain the relative sensitivity of specific leukemic
cells to 6BT. It is possible that 6BT nonresponsive leukemic cells
do not express the particular transporter(s) required for 6BT to
enter cells.
Overall, 6BT is a promising new AML differentiation–inducing
agent. 6BT exhibits both in vitro and in vivo activity in at least a
subset of leukemic cells. Due to the current poor prognosis of
patients with AML, new agents and therapeutic strategies are
greatly needed. Further elucidation of the mechanism of action of
6BT and its in vivo properties are necessary to determine its clinical
potential.
