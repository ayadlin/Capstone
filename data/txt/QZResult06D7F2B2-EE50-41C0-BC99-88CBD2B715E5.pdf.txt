ABSTRACT
The dynamic balance of cellular sphingolipids, the sphingolipid rheostat,
is an important determinant of cell fate, and is commonly deregulated in cancer.
Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a signaling molecule with anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative
and pro-angiogenic effects, while conversely, ceramide and sphingosine are proapoptotic. The sphingosine kinases (SKs) are key regulators of this sphingolipid
rheostat, and are attractive targets for anti-cancer therapy. Here we report a firstin-class ATP-binding site-directed small molecule SK inhibitor, MP-A08, discovered
using an approach of structural homology modelling of the ATP-binding site of SK1
and in silico docking with small molecule libraries. MP-A08 is a highly selective
ATP competitive SK inhibitor that targets both SK1 and SK2. MP-A08 blocks proproliferative signalling pathways, induces mitochondrial-associated apoptosis in a
SK-dependent manner, and reduces the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma
tumours in a mouse xenograft model by both inducing tumour cell apoptosis and
inhibiting tumour angiogenesis. Thus, this selective ATP competitive SK inhibitor
provides a promising candidate for potential development as an anti-cancer therapy,
and also, due to its different mode of inhibition to other known SK inhibitors, both
validates the SKs as targets for anti-cancer therapy, and represents an important
experimental tool to study these enzymes.

immune cell trafficking and vascular integrity, while S1P
in general confers pro-proliferative, pro-survival signaling
[5]. Sphingosine and many ceramide species, however,
are pro-apoptotic, modulating the activity of a range
of enzymes involved in the control of cell survival [5].
Thus, the balance between the cellular levels of S1P and
ceramide/sphingosine, the so-called sphingolipid rheostat,
appears an important regulator of cell fate.
The cellular levels of the sphingolipids are
controlled by an array of bidirectional metabolic
pathways that are subject to complex spatial and temporal

INTRODUCTION
A number of sphingolipids, including ceramide,
sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), are
important signaling molecules controlling a diverse
array of important cell processes [1]. S1P, in particular,
has diverse cell signaling roles through its actions as
both a ligand for a family of five S1P-specific G proteincoupled receptors (named S1P1–5), as well as a modulator
of a range of intracellular proteins [2–4]. S1P receptormediated signaling most notably plays significant roles in

regulation [1, 6]. Some of the most important regulators
of this system are the sphingosine kinases (SKs), which,
through their action of phosphorylating sphingosine
to generate S1P, play a vital role in controlling the
sphingolipid rheostat [1], and therefore, cell fate. Two
SKs exist in mammals; SK1 and SK2, which catalyze
the same reaction and share a high degree of sequence
similarity. The two SKs share some redundant and related
roles, but also appear to possess some different functions,
probably due to their different subcellular localizations,
with SK1 predominantly localized to the cytoplasm
while SK2 is mainly localized at the nucleus and other
organelles [7].
The SKs have been widely implicated in
carcinogenesis. SK1 expression is elevated in a wide
array of human solid cancers, with higher levels of SK1
correlating with the severity of malignancy and shorter
patient survival [8]. Similarly, SK2 was recently found to
be elevated in human non-small cell lung cancer, with high
expression levels correlated with poor patient survival [9].
Furthermore, a large number of studies have shown that
targeting SKs has considerable potential as an anti-cancer
strategy. For example, RNAi-mediated knockdown or
inhibition of SK1 and SK2 has been widely demonstrated
to induce apoptosis and enhance sensitivity to chemo- or
radiation therapy of many different cancer cells [10, 11].
Similarly, genetic ablation of SK1 and SK2 in mice was
found to reduce tumor growth in vivo in numerous cancer
models [12–19]. This body of evidence has secured the
SKs as promising therapeutic targets in cancer and has
driven drug development to target the enzymes in a range
of cancer models [10, 11].
Initial SK inhibitor development used
molecules derived from sphingosine including L-threodihydrosphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine and N,N,Ntrimethylsphingosine. These compounds, however, have
low specificity, with several important off-targets identified,
such as protein kinase C, ceramide synthase and the 14–3-3
pro-survival protein [11, 20]. Other inhibitors developed to
more selectively target the sphingosine-binding pockets of
SK1 and SK2 have been successful in blocking cancer cell
growth and reducing tumor burden in animal models [2, 11].
Again, however, these second generation SK inhibitors
also appear to have numerous off-targets, with the most
commonly employed SK inhibitor in the last decade, SKI-II
[21] recently shown to inhibit dihydroceramide desaturase
[22] and also enhance signalling via the Nrf2 transcription
factor in a SK-independent manner [23]. Similarly, the most
commonly used SK2-selective inhibitor ABC294640 has
been shown to also act as a direct antagonist of the estrogen
receptor [24].
Notably, some high affinity sphingosine-competitive
SK1 inhibitors developed recently have been controversial.
Despite showing potent SK1 inhibition in vitro and
decreases in S1P in cells, these inhibitors failed to induce
apoptosis or show anti-neoplastic properties in vivo
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[25–27]. This has lead to the groups that developed
these reagents to reach the contentious conclusion that
SK activity is not required for tumor cell viability [26],
despite the large body of evidence to the contrary. Notably,
unlike other SK inhibitors or SK knockdown, these recent
inhibitors failed to enhance cellular ceramide levels at low
concentrations where SK1 was inhibited [25–27]. This
suggests the similarity of these molecules to sphingosine
may result in off-target inhibition of ceramide synthases
which blocks ceramide generation and associated ­proapoptotic signaling.
Here we describe the discovery and characterization
of a novel SK inhibitor, MP-A08, using a structure-based
approach to target the ATP-binding pocket of SK1. Via
this approach we both exploit the known divergence of
the SK ATP-binding site from other kinases [28] and also
overcome common off-target effects of sphingosine-like
molecules. Characterization of MP-A08 demonstrated its
high selectivity to SK1 and SK2 over other kinases, and
importantly revealed its anti-neoplastic effects against a
panel of cancer cell lines in vitro and also in human lung
tumor xenografts in mice.

RESULTS
Modeling and validation of the ATP-binding
pocket of SK1
Until recently there was no structural information
available for SK1. Therefore, we employed homology
modeling to predict the structure of the ATP-binding
pocket of SK1 using the solved structures of two
bacterial lipid kinases, DgkB [29] and YegS [30] that,
while possessing little overall sequence similarity to
SK1, do show some sequence similarity with residues
proposed to contribute to ATP binding in SK1 [1, 28,
31] (Supplementary Figure 1). In the model (Figure 1A),
residues from all five regions highly conserved in the SKs
(Motifs 1–5; Supplementary Figure 1) were involved
in forming the ATP-binding pocket of SK1, with the
79
SGDGLMHE86 motif forming the centre of the pocket.
To identify potential residues most important for ATP
binding we next computationally docked ATP into the
predicted SK1 ATP-binding pocket (Figure 1A). The
docked ATP was predicted to form hydrogen bonds with
multiple residues in Motifs 1 to 4 (Asn22, Thr54, Gly80,
Asp81, Gly82, Leu83, Glu86 and Ser112) (Figure 1A).
Additionally, Asp341 and Glu343 from Motif 5 were
predicted to coordinate a magnesium ion, as inferred from
similarity to the DgkB structure [29].
To validate the modeling and ATP docking we then
carried out alanine mutagenesis of the residues predicted
to contribute to the ATP-binding pocket. Mutagenesis
of all the SK1 residues predicted to form hydrogenbonds with ATP either abolished or substantially reduced
enzyme activity, while mutation of other residues in this

region not predicted to directly interact with ATP (Arg24,
Glu55 and Ser79) generally had less effect (Figure 1B).
Mutation of Asp341 and Glu343 abolished SK1 activity,
consistent with their proposed role in the coordination
of the magnesium ion cofactor. Together, these findings
supported the accuracy of the model. Notably, the recent
availability of the SK1 crystal structure [32] also enabled
us to retrospectively assess the validity of our model.
Structural alignment of the ATP-binding pocket residues
of our SK1 ATP-binding site model with those of the
ADP-bound SK1 crystal structure (3VZD) showed very
close alignment (RMSD = 1.1366 Å), further confirming
the validity of our model (Supplementary Figure 2).
Interestingly, the main differences between our model and
the SK1 structure were in Arg185 and Arg191, which were
excluded from the model because the sequence identity in
that region was below the required threshold for homology
modeling (< 30%). These residues contribute to binding
of the β-phosphate of ADP in the crystal structure and
were confirmed to contribute to ATP binding as alanine
mutations of Arg185 and Arg191 substantially reduced
SK1 activity (Figure 1B).

R191A mutations. Interestingly, the R24A mutation did
not affect SK1 activity (Figure 1B) but reduced MP-A08
inhibition (Figure 1E), which was in agreement with the
docking where the Arg24 side-chain was overarching
the central phenyl rings of MP-A08 (Figure 1D). These
findings confirm that MP-A08 is an inhibitor targeting the
ATP-binding pocket of SK1. Together with the docking
it also suggests that a subset of the residues that bind
the adenosine component of ATP, namely Arg24, Thr54,
Glu55 and Leu83, accommodate the amine group from the
benzene-sulfonamide and the central imine in MP-A08.
Additionally, the polar side-chains of Ser79 and Ser112
and the positively charged Arg185 and Arg191 which
coordinate the negatively charged phosphates of ATP,
accommodate the bulky phenyl rings and sulfonyl group in
MP-A08. A lack of activity precluded us from testing the
affect of mutation at Asp81 on MP-A08 binding; however,
it is predicted that the acidic side-chain of this residue
would also contribute to MP-A08 binding.
To assess its selectivity, MP-A08 was tested
against purified recombinant human SK1 and SK2, with
both enzymes being similarly inhibited (Figure 1F).
Notably, unlike some other recently developed SK
inhibitors [26], comparable inhibition of murine SK1 and
SK2 was also observed (Figure 1F). We also examined the
inhibitory activity of MP-A08 against the related human
lipid kinases, diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) and ceramide
kinase (CERK), which both show considerable polypeptide
sequence similarity to the SKs in most of the conserved
regions involved in forming the ATP-binding pocket [31]
(Motifs 1–5). Notably, MP-A08 showed no inhibition of
human DAGK, and only weakly inhibited CERK when
employed at 192 μM (Figure 1F). Since SKI-II was
recently shown to inhibit dihydroceramide desaturase
[22] we also tested whether MP-A08 had any effects on
this enzyme. While, consistent with this previous study,
dihydroceramide desaturase activity was substantially
blocked by 10 μM SKI-II, no effects were observed by 20
μM MP-A08 (data not shown). To further assess specificity,
we next tested MP-A08 against a panel of 140 human
protein kinases. Consistent with the structural divergence
of the ATP-binding pocket of SK1 from that of the protein
kinases, initial screening showed very few protein kinases
were affected by 25 μM MP- A08, and those that were only
displayed modest inhibition (Supplementary Table 1).
Further analysis using very high concentrations of MPA08 (250 μM) against seven protein kinases that were
inhibited by more than 30% in the initial screen, failed
to show a dose-dependent trend for six of the enzymes.
Only testis-specific serine kinase 1 (TSSK1) was modestly
inhibited (by 57%) at this very high concentration of MPA08 (Supplementary Table 1).
Inhibition kinetics confirmed that MP-A08 was
an ATP-competitive inhibitor of human SK1 and SK2
(Figure 2A–2B). Somewhat surprisingly, MP-A08 was a
higher affinity inhibitor of SK2 than SK1, with Ki values

Virtual screening identifies MP-A08 as a novel
SK-selective inhibitor
The validated model of the ATP-binding pocket
of SK1 was then used in a virtual screen to identify
novel inhibitors of SK1. Libraries composed of 120,000
compounds were docked into the ATP-binding pockets
of the SK1 model and DgkB structure using a twostep screening approach. Candidate compounds were
chosen that displayed preferential docking scores and
orientation for the ATP-binding pocket of SK1 over
that of DgkB. Physical screening of the top candidate
compounds was then performed to examine their
ability to inhibit the activity of purified recombinant
SK1 in vitro. From this screening we identified several
novel hit molecules (data not shown) however due
to superior inhibition and solubility 4-methyl-N-[2-[[2[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonylamino]phenyl]iminomethyl]
phenyl]benzenesulfonamide (henceforth referred to as
MP-A08) (Figure 1C) was chosen for further investigation
as an inhibitor of SK1. The molecule contains two
benzenesulfonamide groups joined by a central benzy­
lideneaniline group.
MP-A08 docked into the ATP-binding pocket of
SK1 in close association with conserved Motifs 1–3, and
was predicted to form close associations with Asn22,
Arg24, Thr54, Ser79, Gly80, Asp81, Gly82, Leu83
and Ser112 (Figure 1D). To confirm this orientation of
MP-  A08 binding we next assessed its ability to inhibit
the ATP-binding pocket mutants of SK1 (Figure 1E).
MP-A08 inhibition of SK1 was reduced by around threefold by the T54A, L83A, R185A and S112A mutations
and approximately two-fold by the S79A, R24A and

of 6.9 ± 0.8 μM and 27 ± 3 μM, respectively. In order
to analyze these differences in binding to SK1 and SK2
we produced a homology model of SK2 using the recent
SK1 crystal structure, and then docked MP-A08 into
the SK1 crystal structure (Figure 2C) and the predicted
SK2 ATP-binding pocket (Figure 2D). Comparison of
the SK1 crystal structure and the SK2 model revealed a
highly conserved ATP pocket with the exception of the
substitutions at SK2Phe154/SK1Arg24 and SK2Asn187/SK1Arg57
(Figure 2C–2D, Supplementary Figure 3A–3B). In the
SK1 structure Arg24 and Thr54 appear to coordinate one
of the central phenyl rings of MP-A08 and shield the amine
groups from the basic side-chains of Arg24 and Arg57. The
second central phenyl ring likely shields the internal amine
group from the Arg185 and Arg191 side-chains, pointing
the sulfonyl groups towards Asn22, Ser79 and Leu83
in SK1 (Figure 2C). One methyl substituted ring points
out towards the outside of the pocket and the other is
orientated towards the internal Ser112 and the Arg185 and
Arg191 side-chains in SK1. The predicted orientation of
MP-A08 in the ATP-binding pocket of SK2 is altered due
to the substituted residues at Phe154 and Asn187 (Arg24
and Arg57 in SK1, respectively). The bulky aromatic
side-chain of Phe154 and the smaller basic side-chain of
Asn187 alter both the size and charge of the ATP pocket
in SK2 (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 3A–3B).
The terminal methylphenyl rings point towards the sidechain of Thr184 and Asn152. Compared to the SK1
pocket, the central phenyl rings of MP-A08 are shifted
towards the bottom of the SK2 pocket, coordinated by
Arg315 and Arg321. The sulfonyl groups are tethered via
hydrogen bonding to Asn152 and Ser242 side-chains.
To validate the SK2 model we tested alanine
mutants of the SK2 ATP pocket predicted to contribute to
MP-A08 binding. As was found with the corresponding
residues in SK1, SK2 activity was significantly reduced
with alanine mutations at Asn152, Thr184, Ser242, Arg315
and Arg321 (Figure 2E). Conversely, alanine mutations of
either Phe154 or Leu213 displayed a two-fold increase in
SK2 activity (Figure 2E), due to the removal of the bulky
side-chains. These residues are involved in binding the
adenosine of ATP, therefore removal of either of these

side-chains appears to reduce steric hindrance in this
region of the pocket. We next assessed the SK2 mutants
for MP-A08 binding. In agreement with the docking
we found that alanine mutations at Asn152, Thr184
and Leu213 gave some reduction in SK2 inhibition
by MP-A08, while mutations at Arg315 and Arg321
resulted in much less inhibition of SK2 by this inhibitor
(Figure 2F). Alanine mutation at Phe154 had only a minor
effect on SK2 inhibition by MP-A08 as it is shielded by
the side-chain of Asn152 (Figure 2F), which was, again,
in agreement with the docking. Surprisingly, mutation at
Ser242 did not affect MP-A08 binding in SK2 despite the
predicted hydrogen bonding interaction of its side-chain
hydroxyl. It appears that for SK2 Arg315 and Arg321
tether MP-A08 in the pocket without the involvement of
Ser242, whilst in SK1 Arg185, Arg191 and Ser112, all
contribute to MP-A08 binding in this region of the ATP
pocket.

MP-A08 does not induce degradation of SK1
Some SK inhibitors, such as SKI-II and PF-543
have been found to inhibit SK1 in cells by targeting the
protein for proteasomal degradation [33–36,  45]. Therefore
we investigated whether MP-A08 induced proteasomal
degradation of SK1. As reported previously [34], treatment
with SKI-II caused a reduction in SK1 levels which
could be restored with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Figure 3). Conversely, however, cell treatment with MPA08 had no affect on SK1 protein levels, demonstrating that
MP-A08 does not induce degradation of SK1 (Figure 3).

MP-A08 inhibits S1P production in cells and
increases pro-apoptotic sphingolipids
To test whether MP-A08 was a cell permeable
SK inhibitor we next examined its ability to block S1P
generation in cells. Treatment of Jurkat cells pre-labeled
with 3H-sphingosine with 15 μM MP-A08 resulted in
significantly reduced cellular S1P generation (Figure 4A),
confirming this compound is cell permeable and able to
block SK activity in cells. In order to assess the impact

of MP-A08 on endogenous cellular sphingolipids the
sphingolipid profile of MP-A08-treated Jurkat cells was
analyzed (Figure 4B). Significant increases in levels
of dihydrosphingosine, C16-dihydroceramide and all
ceramides examined were observed at both 6 and 16 h after
cell exposure to MP-A08 (Figure 4B). Indeed, cells treated
with MP-A08 for 6 hours displayed significant increases
in dihydrosphingosine and all ceramide species compared
to vehicle-treated cells, but most notably in C18-, C20and C20:1-ceramide, which displayed 3.7, 3.5 and 5.8fold increases, respectively (Figure 4B). At 16 h after
MP-A08 treatment the levels of C18-, C20- and C20:1ceramides remained significantly elevated compared to
vehicle controls (3.4, 2.8, 3.9-fold, respectively), while
levels of C14- and C18:1-ceramide, dihydrosphingosine
and sphingosine were elevated further compared to the 6
hour treatment. As expected, S1P levels were significantly
decreased at both time points with 2-fold reduction at 6 h
and a 3.5-fold reduction after 16 h.

indicating mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
consistent with induction of mitochondrial-mediated
apoptosis (Figure 5F).
To validate the SKs as the targets of MP-A08induced apoptosis we next assessed the sensitivity
of primary SK1/SK2 double knockout (dKO) mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to MP-A08 treatment
(Figure 5G). Unlike wildtype MEFs, which showed
a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis with MP-A08
treatment, dKO MEFs had an elevated basal level of
apoptosis that was unaffected by MP-A08 treatment
(Figure 5G). These results strongly suggest that MP-A08
induced-apoptosis is mediated by inhibition of the SKs.

MP-A08 blocks survival and neoplastic growth
of a range of cancer cell lines
Due to the ability of MP-A08 to induce apoptosis
in Jurkat cells we then tested its affects on the growth of
a range of solid cancer cell lines, including three from
the NCI60 human tumor cell line panel (A549 lung
adenocarcinoma cells, and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
breast adenocarcinoma cells) (Figure 6A), as well as BJ7
human foreskin fibroblasts transformed via the expression
of V12-Ras, the telomerase catalytic subunit and the
SV40 large and small T antigens [40] and the parental
untransformed foreskin fibroblast line, BJ1 (Figure 6B).
These cell lines, along with Jurkat cells, were treated
with varying doses of MP-A08 to determine the median
effective concentration (EC50) to block cell proliferation
(Figure 6A–6B, 6D). Growth of all five of the transformed
cell lines (A549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Jurkat and BJ7)
was blocked by MP-A08, but with varying sensitivities
(Figure 6A–6B, 6D), while notably the growth of the
untransformed BJ1 fibroblast line was not affected by
MP-A08 (Figure 6B). We next assessed the EC50 of MPA08 required to block neoplastic, anchorage-independent
growth of the solid tumor cell lines in in vitro colony
formation assays, as a better indicator of anti-neoplastic
activity. Again, MP-A08 blocked neoplastic growth of all
four cell lines (Figure 6C–6D). Interestingly, however,
the cell lines displayed very different sensitivities in
the colony formation and cell growth assays. A549
cells, for example, were least sensitive to MP-A08 in
cell proliferation assays, but most sensitive in colony
formation assays (Figure 6C–6D).

MP-A08 induces mitochondrial-mediated
apoptosis
As MP-A08 treatment was found to increase levels
of pro-apoptotic ceramides we next assessed the affects of
MP-A08 on signaling pathways associated with survival
and proliferation. S1P is known to regulate the Akt and
MAPK pathways via signaling through the S1P G-protein
coupled receptors and via other unknown intracellular
pathways [37]. As expected, MP-A08 treatment caused
a dose-dependent loss in activation of the pro-survival
and pro-proliferative Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, and
induction of the apoptosis-associated p38 and JNK
pathways (Figure 5A).
Previous studies have demonstrated that knockdown
or inhibition of SKs induces apoptosis in many cell types
[11, 38, 39]. Thus, we next assessed the effects of MP-A08
on induction of apoptosis via an array of apoptosis markers;
caspase-3 cleavage and activation, PARP cleavage,
Annexin V staining, and mitochondrial permeability
transition by TMRE staining (Figure 5B–5F). Treatment
of Jurkat cells with 10 and 15 μM MP-A08 caused a dosedependent induction of caspase 3 activity (Figure 5B). This
was confirmed by immunoblotting for caspase 3 and PARP
cleavage products, which demonstrated a dose-dependent
activation of caspase 3 and inactivation of PARP with
MP-A08 treatment (Figure 5C). Consistent with this,
MP- A08 also induced cell surface expression of annexin
V in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5D). To verify that
MP-A08 was inducing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis,
Jurkat cells overexpressing the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein
were treated with MP-A08 and assessed for apoptosis.
Bcl2 overexpression blocked both MP-A08-induced
annexin V staining and PARP cleavage compared to the
parental cells (Figure 5D–5E). MP-A08 treatment of cells
also reduced TMRE staining in a dose-dependent manner,

Figure 4). Furthermore, no differences were detected in
tissue pathology of the kidney, liver, heart and spleen
between these MP-A08 treated mice and vehicle treated
mice, suggesting low toxicity of MP-A08.
We next examined in vivo efficacy of MP-A08 to
attenuate growth of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma
xenografts in mice. Subcutaneous xenografts of A549
cells were established in NOD/SCID mice and grown
to a volume of approximately 75 mm3 before mice were
treated with MP-A08 at 100 mg/kg, six times a week for
two weeks. MP-A08 significantly reduced tumor volume
and weight (Figure 7A–7B). Consistent with in vivo SK
inhibition, excised tumors from MP-A08 treated mice
displayed significantly lower S1P compared to the tumors
from vehicle control mice (Figure 7C). MP-A08 treated
tumors exhibited significantly higher levels of apoptotic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell death compared to the vehicle control as indicated by
TUNEL staining (Figure 7D). In addition to promoting
cell growth and survival, SK has an established role
in promoting cancer angiogenesis [41]. As expected,
MP- A08 treated tumors showed reduced vasculature as
signified by a reduction in CD31 positive blood vessels
(Figure 7E). This data, therefore, suggests MP-A08 acts
as an anti-cancer agent by both inducing apoptosis and
blocking angiogenesis.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have identified MP-A08 as a novel,
first-in-class selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of SK1
and SK2. MP-A08 alters the balance of the sphingolipid
rheostat away from anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative S1P,

towards pro-apoptotic sphingosine and ceramide, and as
a result blocks neoplastic growth and induces apoptosis
in a range of human cancer cell lines. Furthermore,
MP-A08 is active in vivo, inhibiting the growth of human
lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in mice via a
mechanism that involved both induction of tumor cell
apoptosis and reduction in tumor angiogenesis.
Previously developed SK inhibitors have almost
exclusively targeted the sphingosine-binding pocket
of these enzymes. As these inhibitors often retain
sphingosine-like characteristics, just like sphingosine,
they can have off-target affects [11, 20, 22–24]. The
sphingosine-analog inhibitor SKI-II, for example,
inhibits dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme in the
de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway [22]. Similarly,
the sphingosine-like FTY720, which shares a common
backbone with other sphingosine-analog inhibitors, can
at high concentrations disrupt membranes, inhibit other
sphingosine-binding or lipid metabolizing enzymes such
as ceramide synthase and S1P lyase, and also target
protein phosphatase 2A, the pro-survival 14–3-3 protein,
and autotaxin [42]. For this reason we sought ways to
target the ATP pocket of SK1 for inhibitor development; a
strategy employed with success with many protein kinase
inhibitors despite these proteins possessing a very high
degree of structural conservation in their ATP binding
sites [43, 44]. For the SKs, this approach was particularly
attractive as their ATP-binding pockets are structurally
distinct from protein kinases, as well as almost all
other lipid kinases [28, 32], allowing it to be effectively
exploited for inhibitor development.
Until very recently no structural information was
available for the SKs. Therefore, we employed a homology
modeling and in silico docking approach to screen for
inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of SK1.
Notably, retrospective comparison showed our predicted
SK1 model aligned very closely with the recently
published SK1 crystal structure [32]. Using modeling
and mutagenesis we have built on the mechanistic
understanding of catalysis by the SKs obtained from
the SK1 crystal structure by characterizing the residues
required for ATP binding and catalysis of SK1. Of note,
our analysis demonstrated the requirement of residues
from all five regions highly conserved in the SKs;
21
LNPRGG26, 54TERR57, 79SGDGLMHE86, 111GSGN114
and 340VDGE343 (where underlined residues denote where
mutation reduced or abolished SK1 activity). Furthermore,
our prediction and mutagenesis of the ATP-binding pocket
of SK2 confirmed its high overall conservation with that
of SK1, but also uncovered key differences in this region
between the two human SK isoforms that may allow for
the development of isoform-selective ATP-competitive
inhibitors of these enzymes.
Identification and subsequent analysis of MPA08 inhibition revealed it to act, as expected, as an ATP
directed inhibitor of SK1. MP-A08 also inhibited SK2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in a comparable manner, although surprisingly with a
somewhat higher affinity than SK1. Analysis of MP-A08
docking into the SK1 structure and SK2 model suggests
that the Phe154 and Asn187 substitutions in the ATPbinding pocket of SK2 (compared to Arg24 and Arg57
in SK1, respectively) may explain, in part, the increased
MP- A08 affinity for SK2. These amino acid substitutions
in the SK2 pocket are predicted to cause an altered
arrangement of the phenyl rings of MP-A08, binding
the molecule deeper into the pocket. Interestingly,
inhibition of SK1 by MP-A08 did not induce proteasomal
degradation. This is in contrast to the sphingosine-analog
inhibitors SKI-II [34], PF-543 and 55–21 [45]. Therefore it
is tempting to speculate that inhibitor-induced degradation
is a property regulated by binding to the sphingosine
pocket and not the ATP pocket of SK1.
Consistent with the divergent structure of the ATPbinding pocket of SK1 from protein kinases, MP-A08
displayed a high degree of specificity for the SKs. This
is in stark contrast to CB5468139, the only other ATPbinding site directed SK1 inhibitor described to date,
which inhibited a broad array of protein kinases [46].
Indeed, TSSK1 appeared the only potential off-target
of MP-A08 in our kinome screen, although the in vitro
inhibition of this protein kinase by MP-A08 was only
modest, even when the inhibitor was employed at 250
μM. Notably, TSSK1 expression is restricted to the testis,
and thus any potential inhibitory effect on this protein
kinase is unlikely to impact on the findings of this study.
Furthermore, due to its role in spermatid maturation,
TSSK1 has been targeted for contraceptive development
[47], meaning any off-target inhibition of this enzyme is
unlikely to present serious detrimental side-effects in vivo.
Interestingly, our studies also showed that Ser79, Leu83
and Ser112 of SK1 contribute to MP-A08 binding. Since
these residues are not conserved in CERK and DAGK,
this is consistent with these residues conferring selectivity
of MP-A08 for the SKs over other related members of the
SK/DAGK superfamily.
It is notable that MP-A08 significantly increased
the cellular levels of sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine
and all ceramide and dihydroceramide species examined
(Figure 4B). Unlike SKI-II which displays off-target
inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase, increases in
dihydroceramides with MP-A08 treatment are likely
induced by ceramide accumulation and re-equilibration
of all upstream pre-cursors (including dihydroceramides
and dihydrosphingosine). Our findings with MP-A08
are consistent with almost all previous studies that have
found significant increases in ceramide levels following
genetic ablation, or transient knockdown or inhibition of
SK1, with this correlating with induction of apoptosis [38,
39, 48, 49]. This is, however, in stark contrast to some
recently reported high affinity SK inhibitors that fail to
induce apoptosis or show anti-neoplastic effects [25–27].
Notably, where examined, these high affinity inhibitors
7076

Oncotarget

did not show any enhanced ceramide levels when used
at concentrations sufficient to inhibit SK1 [25, 27]. This,
combined with observed increases in sphingosine levels by
these inhibitors, which would normally be associated with
enhanced ceramides [21, 38, 39, 46, 50, 51], suggest these
high affinity inhibitors may exhibit inhibitory effects on at
least some ceramide synthases [45], potentially explaining
their impotence as anti-neoplastic agents.
Examination of the downstream signaling affects of
SK1/2 inhibition by MP-A08 revealed a dose-dependent
reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK1/2
(Figure 5A), indicating a dampening of the phos­
phoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/ERK1/2 pathways,
respectively. MP-A08 concomitantly induced a dosedependent activation of stress pathways through
phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK (Figure 5A). This loss of
pro-survival and pro-proliferative signaling and induction
of stress-induced signaling, combined with induction
of numerous markers of apoptosis, is completely in
agreement with known effects of blockade of the SK
pathway [21, 38, 39, 46, 50, 51]. Furthermore, the absence
of effects of MP-A08 on MEFs lacking SK1 and SK2
provides considerable evidence that the observed cellular
effects of this molecule are mediated via SK1/2 inhibition.
Interestingly, transient SK inhibition in wildtype MEFs
resulted in greater apoptosis than that observed with
genetic ablation of the SKs in the dKO MEFs. While the
reasons for this remains unclear, it is possible that the
chronic loss of SKs in the dKO cells results in selection
of a population of MEFs that is somewhat more resistant
to apoptosis.
Examination of the sensitivities to MP-A08
of different cancer lines showed both reduced cell
proliferation and in vitro neoplastic growth, with EC50
values comparable to those of a number of other widely
employed SK inhibitors [46, 52]. In addition, MP-A08
did not affect the growth of the parental untransformed
BJ1 fibroblast cell line, while the transformed BJ7 cells
displayed a dose-dependent reduction in cell growth with
treatment (Figure 6B). This suggests that transformed cells
are more sensitive to MP-A08 consistent with previous
non-oncogene addiction theories for the SKs [53, 54].
With A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells
demonstrating sensitivity to MP-A08 we undertook a
mouse xenograft study with these cells, with MP-A08
significantly reducing tumor growth, demonstrating
clear efficacy of this inhibitor in vivo. Indeed, MPA08 enhanced tumor apoptosis, and consistent with the
known role of SK1-derived S1P as a potent angiogenic
factor through S1P1 receptor [55–57], also reduced tumor
vascularization (Figure 7D).
In conclusion, here we report a first-in-class ATPbinding site-directed small molecule SK inhibitor, MPA08 that was discovered using a combined approach
of structural homology modeling of the ATP-binding
site of SK1 and in silico docking with small molecule
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

libraries. MP-A08 is a highly selective ATP-competitive
inhibitor that inhibits both SK1 and SK2. MP-A08 blocks
pro-proliferative signaling, induces apoptosis in an
SK-dependent manner and represses the growth of human
lung adenocarcinoma in a mouse xenograft model by both
inducing tumor apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis.
Therefore, this newly developed SK inhibitor that targets
the ATP-binding pocket provides a promising candidate
for further development as a potential cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prediction of SK structures by homology
modeling
A multiple sequence alignment of human DAGKα
(Genbank Accession number: NP_963848), human
DAGKζ (NP_963290), human CERK (NP_073603),
Escherichia coli YEGs (P76407), Staphylococcus aureus
DgkB (Sequence from PDB code: 2QV7) and human
SK1a (Q9NYA1) was performed using ClustalW [58].
This alignment was used as input for Modeller 9v6 [59].
DgkB (2QV7) and YegS (2JGR) crystal structures were
used as templates for homology modeling. Due to poor
homology with the template structures, residues 1–12,
162–189 and 203–230 of human SK1 were excluded from
the SK1 model. The model was optimized using 50 cycles
of Refmac structure idealization [60]. The CCP4 software
suite was used for model assessment and structural
alignments using Procheck and Superpose modules,
respectively [60]. Figures were produced using the Pymol
graphics program [61]. The structural model of human
SK2 was produced as described above using the human
SK1 crystal structure [32] bound with ADP (3VZD) as
a template. Due to large insertions in the SK2 sequence
(AAH10671) residues 1–142, 355–370 and 609–618 were
excluded from the SK2 model.

In silico molecular screening
The SK1 structural model and DgkB crystal
structure were prepared for docking using the DockPrep
module in Chimera [62]. Docking was performed using
DOCK6 [63, 64] on the eResearch SA Hydra server.
Docking parameters were optimized using comparisons
of the structure of DgkB co-crystallized with ADP and
with the DgkB structure docked with ADP. For in silico
screening, a virtual library of 120,000 compounds was
generated from databases (Sigma-Aldrich, Calbiochem,
and the National Cancer Institute Chemical and Natural
Products libraries) [65]. The docking was carried out in
two stages: initial low stringency screening, and then high
stringency screening. Default high stringency docking
parameters were used with a minimum anchor size
of two atoms and scored with chemical matching. All
compounds that docked at high stringency were assessed

Sphingolipid analysis
S1P generation in cells was assessed in Jurkat
cells suspended at 5 × 105 cells in 1 ml RPMI containing
0.5% FBS. Cells were treated with 15 μM MP-A08 or
vehicle control (0.06% (v/v) DMSO/0.54% (v/v) ethanol)
for 4.5 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were labeled with
0.5 μCi 3H-sphingosine (Perkin Elmer), incubated for
30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2, and then harvested by
centrifugation at 1500 × g for 1 min, washed once with
cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 300 μl
of acidified methanol (methanol:HCl, 100:1, by vol.),
and S1P (including 3H-S1P) extracted by the addition of
300 μl of chloroform, 300 μl of 2M KCl and 30 μl of 3M
NaOH. The samples were mixed and then centrifuged at
13000 × g for 5 min to separate the chloroform and
aqueous/methanol phases, which under these alkaline
conditions contained the partitioned 3H-sphingosine
and 3H-S1P, respectively. 3H-S1P in the upper aqueous/
methanol phase was then determined by scintillation
counting.
Sphingolipid mass spectrometric analyses analysis
was performed on 5 × 106 Jurkat cells treated in the
same manner as above for 6 h or 16 h with either 15
μM MP-A08 or vehicle control. For mass spectrometric
analyses cells were pelleted, lyophilized and sphingosine,
ceramides and their dihydro species assessed at the
Medical University of South Carolina Lipidomics Core
Facility using methods described previously [73]. S1P/
dhS1P levels were assessed by ELISA (MyBioSource,
MBS069092). Cell pellets were prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

MP-A08 cross-screening
SK1 and SK2 activity was determined using
d-erythro-sphingosine (solubilized in fatty acid-free
bovine serum albumin) and [γ32P] ATP as substrates, as
described previously [68]. DAGK assays were performed
using β-octylglucoside solubilized dioleoyl-s,n-glycerol
(DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS), based on methods
previously described [69]. CERK assays were performed
as described previously [70]. Cross-screening assays
were carried out using 20 μM ATP (0.5 μCi [γ32P]ATP)
and contained either MP-A08 (0.1 mg/ml, 192 μM) or
vehicle control (1% DMSO/9% (v/v) ethanol final).
Data are represented as % activity compared to vehicle
control. For determination of kinetic constants SK assays
were carried out as described above with 7.8–500 μM
ATP and 100 μM sphingosine and treated with either
vehicle (0.25% DMSO/2.25% (v/v) ethanol), 25 or 50 μM
MP-A08. Kinetic constants were calculated using nonlinear regression in Graphpad Prism 5.
Screening of MP-A08 for inhibitory activity against
a panel of 140 protein kinases encompassing the major
enzymes within this protein family was performed at
the Dundee International Centre for Kinase Profiling.
Dihydroceramide desaturase assays were carried out in
intact Jurkat cells as described previously [71].

Assessment of apoptosis, cell viability, and
proliferation
Jurkat cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with
vehicle (70% PEG, 0.28% v/v final) or MP-A08 (5–15
μM) for 5 or 24 h in RPMI medium containing 0.5%
FBS. Analysis of TMRE staining and caspase 3 activity
were carried out as described previously [74]. Annexin
V staining was carried out according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Annexin-V-Fluos, Roche) and analyzed by
flow cytometry as described previously [74]. Generation
of the Jurkat cell line stably expressing human Bcl-2α will
be described elsewhere.
For population cell growth assays, adherent cancer
cell lines (A549, BJ1, BJ7, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231)
were seeded into 48-well plates (20,000 cells per well)
or 96-well plates (15,000 cells per well) 8 h prior to
treatment. Cells were then treated with MP-A08 or
vehicle control (0.16% (v/v) DMSO/1.44% (v/v) ethanol)
in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, 1.2 mg/ml penicillin,

SK1 degradation assays
Flp-In T-Rex HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) with
doxycycline-inducible expression of FLAG-tagged human
SK1 were generated as previously described [34, 72].
Expression of wild-type SK1 in Flp-In T-Rex HEK293
cells was induced with low concentrations of doxycycline
hyclate (50–200 ng/ml) that resulted in approximately
10-fold increases in SK1 activity above basal levels. After
24 h, cells were treated with 10 μM SKI-II or 30 μM
MP-A08 with or without 10 μM MG132. PEG400 0.35%
(v/v), 0.58% (v/v) DMSO was used as the vehicle control.
Cells were harvested after 24 h treatment and assessed
for SK1 levels by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using

staining using the Fluorescein in situ cell death detection
kit (Roche) according the manufacturers’ instructions.
For immunohistological analysis of visualization tumor
tissue sections underwent a citrate buffer antigen retrieval
process followed by blocking with 10% serum/PBS
at room temperature for 60 min. Affinity purified goat
polyclonal antibody to CD31/PECAM-1 (Santa Cruz;
sc-1506) at 0.2 μg/ml was incubated overnight at 4°C
followed by a 35 min incubation with biotinylated rabbit
anti-goat antibody (1:500; Abcam) at room temperature.
Sections were then incubated with VECTASTAIN
Elite ABC Reagent at room temperature for 30 min,
followed by peroxidase substrate solution. Sections were
counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin, mounted using
DPX and visualized on an Olympus BX45 microscope
equipped with an XC10 camera. A single image was
collected using the 10× objective which covered 30–60%
of the total area of the section, and CD31-immunoreactive
vessels were enumerated by a person blinded to the
identity of the samples.

1.6 mg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mM HEPES. After 48 h
relative viable cell numbers were determined using the
MTS assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Apoptosis in MEFs was assessed by DAPI
staining as previously described [72].

Colony formation in soft agar
Assays were performed as previously described
[75], with the following modifications. Cells were
prepared in growth media containing 0.33% DMEMlow-melting point agarose (Sigma) with either MP-A08
or vehicle control. This was overlaid onto 0.5% DMEMlow-melting agarose gel. After 14–21 days cells were
analyzed by light microscopy and the number of colonies
was quantified using ImageJ software [76].

Toxicity study of MP-A08 in NOD/SCID mice
MP-A08, dissolved in 70% (v/v) polyethylene
glycol 400 (PEG 400), was administered at 50, 75 and
100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection daily for
2 weeks, as was vehicle control. Mice were weighed daily,
and murine cell blood counts were determined after two
weeks of treatment by a SYSMEX XE 2100 hematology
analyzer. Tissue pathology of hematoxylin and eosin
stained sections of the kidney, liver, heart and spleen of
MP-A08 and vehicle-treated mice were assessed by an
experienced veterinary pathologist.

A549 xenograft model
Mice were used with permission from the SA
Pathology/Central Adelaide Local Health Network Animal
Ethics Committee and experiments were performed under
guidelines from the Australian code of practice for the
care and use of animals for scientific purposes 7th Edition,
2004.
A549 cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously injected
into the flanks of 6–8 week old female NOD/SCID mice.
Tumor development was assessed daily and measured
by caliper. Four weeks post engraftment when tumor
sizes reached approximately 50–100 mm3, MP-A08
was administered at 100 mg/kg six days a week for
2 weeks, with daily measurement of tumors. Tumors
were then excised and half was fixed in 10% formalin,
paraffin embedded and sectioned. The remaining
tumor was homogenized in a 1.5 ml tube using a pestle
(Axygen) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol,
1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 15 mM NaF, 0.5 mM deoxypyridoxine, 40
mM β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, EDTA-free) and tissue debris was pelleted by
centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 mins at 4°C. S1P
levels in samples were assessed by a S1P ELISA assay
kit (Echelon; K-1900) according to manufacturers’
instructions. Apoptosis was examined by TUNEL
