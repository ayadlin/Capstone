ABSTRACT
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in cancer cell
survival, however, the mechanism of which remains elusive. In this study, we
found that COX-2 was abundantly expressed in breast TAMs, which was correlated
to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Ectopic over-expression of COX-2 in
TAMs enhanced breast cancer cell survival both in vitro and in vivo. COX-2 in TAMs
was determined to be essential for the induction and maintenance of M2-phenotype
macrophage polarity. COX-2+ TAMs promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and
survival by increasing Bcl-2 and P-gp and decreasing Bax in cancer cells. Furthermore,
COX-2 in TAMs induced the expression of COX-2 in breast cancer cells, which in turn
promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway in cancer cells
suppressed COX-2+ TAMs-induced cancer cell survival. These findings suggest that
COX-2, functions as a key cancer promoting factor by triggering a positive-feedback
loop between macrophages and cancer cells, which could be exploited for breast
cancer prevention and therapy.

lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and IFN-γ, macrophages are
polarized to proinflammatory M1 (classical) macrophages
and exert strong microbicidal and tumoricidal activities.
Conversely, when exposed to Th2 cytokines such as IL-4
and IL-13, they are polarized to immunosuppressive
M2 macrophages and involved in parasite containment,
tissue remodeling and tumor progression. Compared with
M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages do not produce proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), IL-1β and IL-12/23, but express high levels of
immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β,
high arginase-1 activity and specific surface markers such
as CD163 and CD206 (mannose receptor). Functional
plasticity of macrophages during tumor progression
has been proposed. Macrophages at early stages of
tumor initiation show an M1 phenotype, while TAMs in
established tumors show an M2-biased phenotype. As a

INTRODUCTION
The tumor microenvironment comprises a
variety of stromal cells that play an essential role in
tumor initiation and progression [1]. Tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs), the most abundant inflammatory
stromal cells in malignant tumors including breast cancer,
have been implicated in orchestration of many stages of
tumor progression such as tumor growth, angiogenesis,
metastasis, and resistance to treatment, through releasing
various factors including chemokines, inflammatory and
growth factors [2, 3]. Several studies have indicated that
increased infiltration of TAMs to breast cancer is strongly
associated with poor prognosis in patients [4, 5].
Macrophages have a tremendous plasticity and
can change their functional profiles repeatedly in
response to environmental stimuli. When exposed to

this study, we aim to investigate the contribution of COX-2
in TAMs to breast cancer progression, and to explore the
mechanisms underlying the process.

particular pathophysiological consequence in the setting of
cancer, the M1-M2 switch is the key step that accelerates
tumor aggressiveness [2, 6, 7].
A large body of work describing a link between
inflammation and cancer has generated intense interest in
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that is the rate-limiting enzyme
in the metabolic conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into
various prostaglandins (PGs) including prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) for mediating inflammation and cancer
progression. Over-expression of COX-2 has been detected
in a number of malignancies including breast cancer, and
contributes to carcinogenesis by stimulating cancer cell
proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, increasing invasiveness
and modulating inflammation and immunity [8, 9]. Clinical
studies have noted a reduced risk for breast, lung, prostate,
and colon cancers after treatment with non-selectively
COX-2 inhibition by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) or selective COX-2 inhibition with
COX-2 inhibitors [10, 11]. COX-2 and its products,
particularly PGE2, act via classical cancer signaling
pathways in primary tumor cells to promote tumorigenesis.
Recent evidence has shed a spotlight not only on the tumor
cell itself, but also the tumor microenvironment, especially
macrophages in the tumor [12]. COX-2-positive TAMs are
found in more advanced melanoma, and appear to act as
a biomarker for melanoma progression [13]. TAMs in the
post-irradiated tumor microenvironment express a higher
level of COX-2, and promote early prostate cancer growth
in mice [14]. Although these data suggest that COX-2 in
TAMs might participate in cancer process, its exact role

RESULTS
High COX-2 expression in TAMs in breast
cancer
Primary TAMs isolated from breast cancer tissue
produced a large amount of IL-10 and arginase-1, and
a small amount of IL-12/23, and exhibited a cluster
of differentiation (CD)163high/CD206high phenotype
(Supplementary Figure S1). MDMs-derived TAMs
established by in vitro co-culture of normal macrophages
(monocyte-derived macrophages, MDMs) with breast
caner cells for 7 days, also showed more M2-like
characteristics than untreated MDMs (Supplementary
Figure S1). Real-time PCR was performed to measure
COX-2 expression in TAMs isolated from breast cancer
patients, paired peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs),
normal MDMs and MDMs-derived TAMs. The mRNA
expression of COX-2 was significantly higher in primary
TAMs and MDMs-derived TAMs, compared with that in
PBMs and untreated MDMs (Figure 1A). Furthermore,
MDMs-derived TAMs produced abundant amounts of
PGE2 in the supernatants (Figure 1B). These results
suggested that there was increased COX-2 expression and
function in breast cancer TAMs.

COX-2 in TAMs may play an important role in breast

involved in mammary tumor progression [15]. In order
to investigate whether COX-2 in macrophages exerted
pro-tumor activity mainly through direct PGE2 effect on
cancer cells, the expression of EP2 and EP4 in breast
cancer cells was confirmed (Figure 3A). The antagonist
against EP2 (AH6809) and EP4 (AH23848) were used
to block the PGE2 signaling. The results showed that
inhibiting the PGE2 signal pathway only partly attenuated
cell proliferation and drug resistance in breast cancer
cells induced by TAMs (Figure 3B–3C), suggesting
that other mediators are involved in COX-2-mediated
communication between TAMs and breast cancer cells.

Over-expression of COX-2 in TAMs promotes
breast cancer cell proliferation and survival
In order to elucidate the tumor-promoting role of
COX-2 in breast TAMs, TAMs were first transfected with
adenoviral COX-2 or siRNA COX-2 (Supplementary
Figure S2), and then co-cultured with different breast cancer
cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) for 7 days. Cancer
cell proliferation, viability or apoptosis induced by various
cytotoxic drugs were measured by CCK-8 or PI staining
assays, respectively. We found that TAMs promoted
proliferation and resistance to drugs-induced apoptosis in
breast cancer cells, which was enhanced by COX-2 overexpression but attenuated by COX-2 knockdown in TAMs
(Figure 2A–2B and Supplementary Figure S3). Consistent
with these in vitro findings, higher mammary tumor weight/
volume was observed in NOD/SCID mice injected with
4T1 murine breast cancer cells/RAW 264.7-derived TAMs,
compared with that in mice injected with 4T1 cells only.
Tumor weight/volume was much higher in mice injected
with 4T1/COX-2+ TAMs, while lower in mice injected
with 4T1/COX-2− TAMs than that in mice injected with
4T1/normal TAMs (Figure 2C). Furthermore, significantly
increased proliferation (Ki- 67 staining) and decreased
apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 staining) were detected in
the tumor specimens of mice injected with 4T1/COX-2+
TAMs, while an inverse result was obtained from mice
injected with 4T1/COX-2− TAMs, compared with that of
mice injected with 4T1/normal TAMs (Figure 2D–2E).

COX-2 is essential for macrophages polarized to
M2 phenotype
Since the polarization of infiltrating macrophages
to M2-like TAMs is the key step that promotes tumor
development by inducing various tumor-related cytokines,
we next investigated whether COX-2 in TAMs promoted
cancer cell survival and proliferation by enhancing
macrophages polarity. The expression of EP1–4
in  MDMs and TAMs was confirmed (Supplementary
Figure S4). The phenotypes of macrophages transfected
with adenoviral COX-2 or siRNA COX-2 were then
identified by detection of arginase activity and cytokines.
We found that COX-2 over-expression or exogenous PGE2
promoted MDMs polarized to M2 phenotype. In contrast,
TAMs treated with siRNA COX-2 lost M2 phenotype
(Figure 3D–3G). These results sytrongly suggest that
COX-2 is an essential factor for the induction and
maintenance of M2 polarity in TAMs.

PGE2 is unlikely the only mediator of the effect
of TAMs COX-2 on breast cancer cells

COX-2 in TAMs increases the expression of
Bcl-2 and P-glycoprotein and decreases Bax
expression in breast cancer cells

As the key factor for the biological function of
the COX-2 pathway, PGE2 activates intracellular signal
transduction by binding to the E-series of prostaglandin
receptors EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. Increasing studies
indicate that EP2 and EP4 are the main EP subtypes

are well documented in breast cancer, and aberrant
expressions of which are strongly associated with
cell survival or resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
[16, 17]. In order to identify whether or which Bcl-2
family members are involved in COX-2+ TAMs-induced
breast cancer cell survival, the common anti-apoptotic
proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and pro-apoptotic proteins
(Bax, Bad and Bid) were detected by Western blot. TAMs
induced Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression in breast
cancer cells (Figure 4A). Ectopic COX-2 expression
significantly promoted, while COX-2 knockout in
TAMs markedly abated, this effect (Figure 4B). In
addition, TAMs increased the efflux of ADM and Rho
123 in cancer cells. Ectopic COX-2 expression in TAMs
significantly reinforced, while inhibiting COX-2 in
TAMs attenuated, this effect (Figure 4C–4D). Because
the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters including
P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), multi-drug resistanceassociated protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1), lung resistance
protein (LRP), and breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP/ABCG2), are membrane proteins that couple the
energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to extrude a variety
of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cancer cells [18],
we examined the effect of COX-2 on expression of these
proteins by Western blot. We found that P-gp but not
other proteins was significantly increased in cancer cells
co-cultured with TAMs (Figure 4E). The association of
P-gp expression in breast cancer cells and COX-2 in
TAMs was validated by ectopic COX-2 expression and
COX-2 knockdown in TAMs (Figure 4F). These results
suggest that TAMs COX-2 enhances breast cancer cell
survival by increasing Bcl-2 and P-gp, and decreasing
Bax in cancer cells.

Over-expression of COX-2 in tumor cells is
closely linked to cell survival, and it is suggested that
TAMs are associated with high COX-2 expression
in cancer cells [19–21]. In addition, PGE2 is also
demonstrated to activate COX-2 expression with a
positive feedback manner [22, 23]. To investigate the
mutual activation between COX-2 in different cell
types, the expression of COX-2 in cancer cells and
macrophages under different co-culture conditions
was examined. We found that COX-2 over-expression
in TAMs enhanced COX-2 expression in breast cancer
cells, while inhibiting COX-2 in TAMs attenuated
this COX-2 induction in cancer cells (Figure 5A).
Interestingly, COX-2 in breast cancer cells was shown
to activate COX-2 in macrophages and induce M2
macrophage polarization (Figure 5B–5F). These results
suggest that COX-2 expressed in both TAMs and cancer
cells forms a positive feedback loop for mediating
communication between TAMs and cancer cells.

COX-2 in TAMs enhances the activation of
PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells
TAMs activate PI3K/Akt pathway in cancer cells, and
aberrant activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is implicated in
breast cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance [24–27].
Our results confirmed the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway
in breast cancer cells co-cultured with TAMs. Moreover,

COX-2 over-expression in TAMs enhanced the activation
of PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells, while inhibiting
COX-2 by siRNA suppressed this effect (Figure 6A).
Among, the three Akt isoforms, Akt1 is the most widely
expressed and the best studied one in cancer progression
[28–30]. Blocking Akt1 in cancer cells suppressed the
pro-survival effects of the COX-2+ TAMs on breast cancer
cells (Figure 6B–6C). Meanwhile, down-regulation of Akt1
resulted in the suppression of Bcl-2, P-gp and COX-2, and
increase of Bax expression in breast cancer cells (Figure 6D).
These results strongly suggest that activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway is closely involved in COX-2+ TAMs-induced
pro-tumor activity in breast cancer cells.

described. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in normal
adult human tissues. In contrast, COX-2 is absent or
expressed at low levels in normal human tissues, but
is induced in endothelial cells, monocytes, and tumor
cells by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, or tumor
promoters [31]. Accumulating evidence shows that
COX-2 is over-expressed in breast cancer cells and is
closely associated with cell proliferation, metastasis,
angiogenesis and immune regulation [32, 33]. In
addition, high level of COX-2 was also prevalent in
other components of tumor microenvironment such as
fibroblasts, myeloid cells and vascular endothelial cells,
and may contribute to malignant tumor progression
[34–36]. In our study, we found that over-expression
of COX-2 in breast TAMs promoted breast cancer cell
proliferation and survival. More importantly, COX-2
exerted an effect on the pro-tumor potential of TAMs.
These results indicate that high expression of COX-2 in
the tumor microenvironment exerts great influence on
cancer progression.
As the principle COX-2 product, PGE2 plays
a critical role in the biological function of COX-2 in
tumors. PGE2 has been implicated in various breast
cancer processes via activating PKC, PKA or TGF-β
signal pathways through specific PGE2 receptors [15].

DISCUSSION
TAMs have been shown to promote tumor growth,
angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis in many cancer
types. TAMs are generally thought to more closely
resemble the M2-polarized phenotype [2, 6]. Here,
we demonstrate that COX-2 is abundantly expressed
in breast TAMs and correlates with poor prognosis
in patients with breast cancer. COX is an enzyme
that converts arachidonic acid into prostaglandin
endoperoxide. Two isoforms of COX have been

D. Inhibiting Akt1 resulted in the suppression of Bcl-2, P-gp and COX-2, and increase of Bax expression in breast cancer cells co-cultured

loading control, and the blots shown are representative of six independent experiments.

However, our study showed that inhibiting the PGE2 signal
transduction in breast cancer cells only partly attenuated
pro-tumor effect induced by COX-2 in TAMs, suggesting
that PGE2 was not the only direct mediator involved in the
process. It was reported that COX-2 inhibition caused loss
of the M2 macrophage characteristics in TAMs, which
may assist to prevent breast cancer metastasis in a murine
breast cancer model [37]. Furthermore, PGE2 is typically
associated with immunosuppression, restraint of M1
macrophage polarization, as well as enhanced expression
of M2 markers [38–40]. Consistent with the reports, we
confirmed that COX-2 was indeed an essential factor for
the induction and maintenance of M2 polarity in human
breast TAMs. COX-2 in TAMs may also exert its protumor effect by increasing various pro-tumor cytokines
release from TAMs. Further studies are needed to identify
the involved cytokines and elucidate the underlying
mechanisms.
TAMs have been shown to induce cell proliferation
and inhibit apoptosis in many kinds of malignant tumors
such as sarcoma, lymphoma, colon and breast cancers
[4, 41–43]. Enhanced stemness of cancer cells by cytokines
(e.g. TGF-β and IL-1β) from TAMs may contribute to the
pro-tumor activities of TAMs [43, 44]. In addition, TAMs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can promote cell survival and resistance to chemotherapeutic
treatment through regulating Bcl-2 family members and
drug-resistance factors in cancer cells [45, 46]. In our study,
we found that TAMs induced breast cancer cell survival
by up-regulating Bcl-2 and p-gp and down-regulating Bax
expression. It has been shown that COX-2 can regulate the
expression of Bcl-2 family members and drug-resistance
proteins in breast cancer cells [47–50]. Our study indicated
that COX-2 in TAMs was involved in the regulating function
of TAMs on Bcl-2 family members and p-gp in cancer cells.
Moreover, we found that there was a positive COX-2mediated feedback loop between TAMs and breast cancer
cells, which may play a key role in tumor microenvironment
reprogramming and thus cancer progression.
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway promotes cancer
cell survival by modulating Bcl-2 members and drugresistance proteins. Bcl-2, Bax and p-gp are all regarded
as the downstream signal molecules of the PI3K/Akt
pathway [51, 52]. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway
in cancer cells is a central event in TAMs-mediated
cancer progression, as chemokines or cytokines secreted
from TAMs may be the effective PI3K/Akt activators
[24, 26, 53]. PGE2 was reported to inhibit apoptosis
in human cancer cells through PI3K/Akt activation.

Furthermore, COX-2/PGE2 was shown to promote
the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway that is a part of
the positive feedback loop to maintain an active prosurvival COX-2/PGE2 pathway in cancer cells [54–57].
Additionally, other cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10, CCL18, etc.)
which can be released from TAMs also have the ability to
promote tumor progression through the PI3K/Akt pathway
[58–60]. All these factors could contribute to COX-2+
TAMs-induced PI3K/Akt activation in breast cancer cells,
which warrants further studies.
In summary, our studies shows that COX-2,
abundantly expressed in TAMs, is important for
macrophages polarization and breast cancer cell survival
(Fig. 7). Future studies are needed to investigate the
detailed mechanism by which COX-2/PGE2 influences the
tumor microenvironment. Accumulating evidence suggests
COX-2 inhibitors are potential anticancer therapeutic
agents [61]. Studies on the emerging roles within the
COX-2/PGE2 pathway in tumor microenvironment may
reveal novel approaches or molecular targets for both
cancer chemoprevention and therapy.

primary breast carcinoma samples from 160 patients with
a median age of 53 years and a median follow-up period of
118 months at the hospitals in central China. Every sample
dot with a diameter of 1.5  mm and a thickness of 4 μm
was prepared according to a standard method. All samples
were collected with informed consent from patients, and
all related procedures were performed with the approval of
ethics boards of the indicated hospitals.

Generation of macrophages or tumor associated
macrophages
Mononuclear cells from the blood of healthy
donors were incubated in 6-well plates for 2 hours
at 37°C to remove non-adherent cells. The adherent
monocytes were incubated for 7 days in medium with
M-CSF to become normal macrophages (monocytederived macrophages, MDMs). MDMs were co-cultured
with breast cancer cells for an additional 7 days to
generate tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) [46].

Isolation of TAMs from tumor tissues by
magnetic-activated cell sorting

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor tissues were minced into small pieces
and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5 ml of HBSS
(10% fetal calf serum) containing 125 U/ml of
collagenase I (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 60 U/ml of Dnase

I and 60 U/ml of hyaluronidase (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA). Supernatants were harvested and then depleted of
RBC with ACK. Cell suspensions were passed through
a fine screen mesh and then several times through a #25
needle. Cell pellets were resuspended and labeled with
biotinylated mouse anti-human CD163 antibody (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) using 0.2 μg /1×106 cells in 100
ml staining buffer. Streptavidin microbeads were added
at 10 ml per 107 cells and then incubated 15 min at 4°C.
Cells were re-suspended in 500 ml of separating buffer
and applied to an LS column in a magnetic field (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Unlabeled cells
that passed through the column were collected, as were
retained cells after removal of the magnetic field [62].

respectively. Thermal cycling conditions were 95°C
for 30 sec, followed by 5 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C
for 40 cycles. Melting-curve analysis and agarose gel
electrophoresis of PCR products were further performed.
Relative expression levels of COX-2 in cells were
standardized to β-actin levels.

Adenovirus infection
The adenovirus expressing empty Ad-Easy1 vector,
COX-2, Akt1, scrambled siRNA or siRNA COX-2
or Akt1 was used following the procedure described
previously [64]. Target sequences of the siRNA specific
for COX-2 and Akt1 are as follows: siRNA-COX-2,
5′-AACCGAGGTGTATGTATGAGTGT-3′;
siRNAAkt1, 5′-TCGTGCCATGATCTGTATTTAAT-3′. In
addition to the expression of transgenes, the adenovirus
expressing system also expressed RFP as amarker for
monitoring transfection efficiency. A series of infections
using various dilutions of adenovirus were conducted to
determine the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI)
in which expression of target genes occurred with low
cytotoxicity.

Arginase activity assay
The arginase activity was measured as previously
described [63]. Briefly, the cell lysate was activated
by heating for 10 min at 56°C. L-arginine hydrolysis
was conducted by incubating the activated lysate with
0.5 M L-arginine (pH 9.7) at 37°C for 15 to 120 min. The
reaction was stopped with H2SO4(96%)/H3PO4(85%) /H2O
(1:3:7, v/v/v, VWR). α-isonitrosopropiophenone (ISPF)
dissolved in 100% ethanol (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
was added and incubated for 45 min at 100°C, followed by
30 min at 4°C. A standard curve was obtained by treating
serially diluted urea with ISPF and incubated in the final
step. The optical density (OD) was measured at 550 nm.
Protein concentration of samples was measured using the
BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, USA). One unit
of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that
catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of urea per min.

Cell proliferation/viability assay
Cells seeded into a 96-well plate at 4000 cells/well
were treated with or without different concentrations of
chemotherapeutic drugs and incubated for 48 h. Cell viability
was measured according to the protocol of CCK-8
(KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China). All plates had control
wells containing medium without cells to obtain a value for
background spectrometric absorbance which was subtracted
from the test sample readings. Data were expressed as ratios
of treated to control cells, mean ± SD for three replications.

ELISA and EIA

Flow cytometry analysis of cell apoptosis

The levels of IL-10 and IL-12/23 p40 in
macrophages were determined by ELISA using human
ELISA Kits, according to the manufacturers’ instruction
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The PGE2
amount in macrophages was determined by EIA kits,
according to the manufacturers’ instruction (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan USA).

For apoptosis analysis, Annexin V-FITC/propidium
iodide (PI) staining (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China)
was performed by Elite ESP flow cytometry according to
the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Animal experiments
All the animal studies were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.
5-Week old severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
hairless female mice were purchased (Institute of Laboratory
Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Science,
Beijing, China) and randomly divided into four groups of
10 mice each. All the mice were housed according to the
national and institutional guidelines for humane animal care.
Macrophages in mice were depleted by injection of freshly
prepared clodronate-containing liposomes as described [62].
At 6 weeks of age, the mice were injected subcutaneously
on the right rear flanks with 4T1 cells that were prior

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction
Real-time PCR was carried out in ABI 7500 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems) by using Maxima
SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (MBI Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Primer pairs were as follows: (a)
COX-2, 5′- TCCCTGAGCATCTACGGTT-3′ (forward)
and 5′-CATCGCATACTGTTGTGTTC -3′ (reverse);
and (b) β-actin, 5′-CCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3′

admixed with COX-2 over-expression, COX-2 knockdown
or wild-type RAW264.7-derived TAMs, respectively. Body
weights were monitored weekly as an indicator of overall
health. After 4 weeks, the mice were euthanized via CO2
asphyxiation. Tumors were then removed, weighed, and sent
for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.

was determined by flow cytometry. The cells above
washed by PBS for 3 times were resuspended and then
cultured with 1640 medium without Rho123 for 2 h. After
washing with PBS for 3 times, intracellular Rho123 was
determined by flow cytometry.

Intracellular adriamycin accumulation assay

Indirect immunofluorescence analysis

Cells were first incubated with 1640 medium
containing 10 μg/ml ADM at 37°C for 1 h. After washing
with PBS for 3 times, the cells were resuspended and then
cultured with 1640 medium without adriamycin (ADM)
for 2 h. After washing with PBS for 3 times, intracellular
ADM was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer.

For the immunofluorescence experiments, paraffin
embedded tissues were prepared and analyzed under
fluorescence microscope following the procedure
described previously [65]. Briefly, samples were incubated
with primary mouse antibody against CD163 and rabbilt
antibody against COX-2, and then incubated with DyLight
488 against mouse IgG or DyLight 549 secondary
antibody against rabbit IgG (Cwbiotech, Beijing, China).
Cells were then counterstained with DAPI and imaged
with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRB).

Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was done using SPSS
18.0 software. Chi-square test was applied to analyze
the relationship between COX-2+ TAMs counts and
clinicopathological status. Pearson’s correlation
and regression analysis was performed to assess
the relationship between COX-2+ TAMs and Ki-67 or
COX-2 in the enrolled samples. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were plotted, and log rank test was done. The
significance of various variables for survival was
analyzed by the Cox proportional hazards model in a
multivariate analysis. The data in cell experiments
were presented as the mean values ± standard deviation
(SD). Differences were considered significant when the
p values were 0.05.

IHC
Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde
solution (pH 7.0) and subsequently embedded in paraffin.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using
the standard streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) method with
the UltraSensitive TM SP Kit (Maixin-Bio, Fujian,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tumor specimens were stained using Ki-67 antibody
(Maixin-Bio, Fujian, China) for cell proliferation and
cleaved caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc., Danvers, MA) for apoptosis. Negative control was
performed by replacing the primary antibody with PBS.
Immunostained slides were blindly evaluated by a trained
pathologist under a transmission light microscope.
