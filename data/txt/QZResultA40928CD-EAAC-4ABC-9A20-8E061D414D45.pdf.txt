BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to review the outcome of women with breast cancer with known receptor status who were treated with whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases and to determine factors that
impact survival. METHODS: A total of 223 women with breast cancer and brain metastases, who received whole brain
radiotherapy, were identified. All women with HER-2–positive disease had received trastuzumab. Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to determine overall survival (OS) estimates. Cox proportional hazards models were then
fitted to explore the association of OS with various patient and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: Median age at brain
metastases diagnosis was 50 years. Sixty-seven (30.2%) patients had hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative
disease, 101 (45.50%) had HER-2–positive disease, and 54 (24.3%) had triple receptor-negative disease. Median OS
from brain metastases was 6 months, with 1-year survival of 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23%-36%). Women
with hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative, HER-2–positive, and triple-negative tumors had median survivals of
5, 9, and 5 months, respectively (P ¼.0069). In the multivariate model, women with HER-2–positive disease had a significantly decreased risk of death compared with women with hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease
(hazard ratio, 0.63; 95%CI, 0.42-0.94; P ¼.02). The risk of death among women with triple-negative disease compared
with hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease was not significantly different (P ¼.54). Lower recursive partitioning analysis class and 30-gray brain radiation dose were also significantly associated with a decreased risk of
death. CONCLUSIONS: Breast tumor subtype has a significant prognostic role among women with breast cancer and
brain metastases. In addition, in the trastuzumab era factors such as recursive partitioning analysis and adequate

Brain metastasis, the most common cause of malignancy in the brain, is a serious cause of comorbidity, afflicting

approximately 100,000 to 170,000 patients per year in the United States.1,2 Breast cancer is the second most common
cause of brain metastases, being diagnosed in approximately 10% to 20% of breast cancer patients; however, autopsy
data suggest that the true prevalence of brain metastases among patients suffering from breast cancer could be as high as
30%.3-5 The incidence of brain metastases among women with breast cancer is likely increasing because of factors such as
improved detection of disease, as well as the introduction of chemotherapeutic and biological agents that result in
improved control of systemic disease but do not cross the blood-brain barrier.

The mainstay of treatment of brain metastases is
whole brain radiotherapy, with the most common fractionation pattern for this treatment in the United States
being 30 gray (Gy) in 10 once daily doses (fractions). Median survival of untreated patients with brain metastases is
approximately 1 month.6 After whole brain radiotherapy,
median survival of approximately 4 to 5 months has been
reported.7,8 However, the prognoses of women with
breast cancer and treated brain metastases vary. Several
studies have reported factors that can predict for better
prognosis, including younger age at brain metastases diagnosis, fewer lesions, and higher Karnofsky performance
score (KPS).9,10 In addition, stratification by Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning
analysis, a classification that is based on age, KPS, and disease status, has consistently been shown to predict for
prognosis, with best survival rates observed in recursive
partitioning analysis class I patients and worst among recursive partitioning analysis class III patients.11
A limited number of studies have explored important prognostic factors such as HER-2 and hormone receptor status after a diagnosis of brain metastases. In
addition, we have previously shown that the administration of trastuzumab among women with HER-2–positive
disease and brain metastases prolongs survival compared
with a comparable group not receiving trastuzumab.12
Thus, an important question that arises is whether the
prognostic significance of previously described factors
persists in the trastuzumab era. The goal of this retrospective study was to determine survival after a diagnosis of
brain metastases in a cohort of women with breast cancer
who had received whole brain radiation. We sought to
confirm the prognostic significance of HER-2 status in
this cohort, and in addition explore factors that would
have a prognostic impact on these patients.

required all women with HER-2–positive disease to have
received trastuzumab either before or after diagnosis of
brain metastases. Excluded from the analyses were
patients who were male, had >1 primary or bilateral disease, or whose tumors had unknown HER-2 status. In
addition, patients with leptomeningeal disease at the time
of brain irradiation were excluded. Variables recorded for
analyses included, but were not limited to, patient demographics, tumor characteristics, number of brain metastases, dose of radiation given for whole brain radiotherapy,
performance status at the time of brain metastases diagnosis, and presence or absence of extracranial metastases.
Medical charts for all patients were then cross-checked to
verify the accuracy of recorded information. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review
board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Pathology
The grade of primary tumor specimens was classified
according to the World Health Organization modified
Black nuclear grading system.13 HER-2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. Tumors
demonstrating no staining by IHC and/or demonstrating
no gene amplification by FISH were considered to be
HER-2 negative. Tumors demonstrating 3þ staining by
IHC and/or gene amplification by FISH were considered
to be HER-2 positive. Tumors that demonstrated 2þ
staining by IHC required FISH confirmation for classification as HER-2 positive or negative. Hormone receptorpositive status was assigned to those tumors that exhibited
positivity for either estrogen or progesterone receptors.
Hormone receptor-negative status was assigned to those
tumors that exhibited negative staining for both estrogen
and progesterone receptors. Tumors were classified as triple-negative if they exhibited both HER-2–negative and
hormone receptor-negative status.

Patient Population
A prospectively collected database, maintained at the
Breast Medical Oncology Department of The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, was used to
identify a cohort of women with histologically confirmed
breast cancer who had developed brain metastases and
received first-line whole brain radiotherapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. As our
previous work has shown the importance of the impact of
trastuzumab on outcome in women with breast cancer
and brain metastases,12 our prespecified study criteria

Outcome Measures and Statistical Analyses
Patient characteristics were categorized by HER-2 status
and compared between groups with the chi-square test
and Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. Breast tumor
subtype was classified as follows: 1) hormone receptor
positive/HER-2 negative, 2) HER-2 positive, or 3) triple
receptor negative. The primary endpoint of this study was
survival after diagnosis of brain metastases, which was
computed from the date of diagnosis of brain metastases
to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up. This

endpoint was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product
limit method and compared between groups with the logrank statistic. All patients alive at the time of analysis were
censored with date of last follow-up. Several covariates
were examined, including HER-2 status, breast tumor
subtype, age at brain metastases diagnosis, initial KPS,
radiation dose, recursive partitioning analysis class, stage
of disease, additional surgery/radiosurgery treatment of
brain metastases, number of involved lymph nodes of the
primary breast tumor, and grade and lymphovascular
invasion of the primary breast tumor.
Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to
explore the association of covariates and survival subsequent to the diagnosis of brain metastases. Covariates
with a P value of <.05 at univariate analysis were chosen
for the Cox models. We further stratified the multivariate
models based on HER-2 status. All statistical tests were 2sided, and P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using the SAS 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Two hundred twenty-three women with breast cancer
who developed brain metastases with known HER-2 status of their tumors were identified. Table 1 summarizes
patient and tumor characteristics stratified by HER-2 status. Median age at diagnosis of brain metastases was 50
years (range, 26-79 years). Sixty-seven (30.2%) patients
had hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease,
101 (45.50%) had HER-2–positive disease, and 54
(24.3%) had triple receptor-negative disease. Among
women with HER-2–positive disease, 22 (21.8%)
received trastuzumab before developing brain metastases,
and 79 (78.2%) received trastuzumab after a diagnosis of
brain metastases. Forty-six (21.1%) women had de novo
stage IV disease, whereas 172 (78.9%) women had recurrent disease after a diagnosis of stage I to III breast cancer.
Seventeen (8%) women presented with brain metastases
as the first site of distant disease. All women received
whole brain radiotherapy for their brain metastases. The
median dose of radiation received was 30 Gy (range, 7.540 Gy), and the median number of fractions was 10
(range, 3-20 fractions). Fifteen (6.73%) women received
<30 Gy, 167 (74.9%) received 30 Gy, and 41 (18.4%)
received >30 Gy of radiation, including a tumor bed
boost in 6 cases. In addition 33 (15%) and 8 (3.6%)
women underwent surgery and radiosurgery, respectively,

3086

for their brain metastases as a component of their initial
treatment.
Survival From Brain Metastases
At the time of this analysis, 184 (82.5%) of women with
breast cancer and brain metastases had died. Median time
to brain metastases for the whole cohort was 12 months
(range, 0-134 months). Median survival after a diagnosis
of brain metastases was 6 months (range, 0-93 months).
One-year survival of the whole cohort was 30% (95% CI
[CI], 23%-36%). Fifty-three women survived >12
months after a diagnosis of brain metastases, of whom 33
(62.3%) survived between 12 months and 24 months, 14
(26.4%) survived between 24 months and 36 months,
and 6 (11.3%) survived >36 months.
Table 2 summarizes the 1-year survival estimates after a diagnosis of brain metastases. On univariate analysis,
several factors were found to be significantly associated
with survival (Fig. 1). Breast tumor subtype was significantly associated with survival, with patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease having a
median survival of 5 months, those with HER-2–positive
disease having a median survival of 9 months, and those
with triple receptor-negative disease having a median survival of 5 months (P ¼ .0069). Older age at brain metastases diagnoses, black race, >10 lymph nodes involved with
disease at primary breast cancer diagnosis, receiving <30
Gy of whole brain radiotherapy, lower KPS, and triple receptor-negative status were all associated with poor survival outcome (Fig. 1). Women with brain metastases
receiving whole brain radiotherapy alone had worse outcome compared with those who had additional treatment
in the form of surgery or radiosurgery of the brain metastases (P < .0001). Women with recursive partitioning
analysis of 3 had poorer survival outcomes compared with
those with recursive partitioning analysis of 1 or 2 (P <
.0001).
Table 3 summarizes the multivariate model results
for the whole cohort. Variables in the model included
breast tumor subtype, stage of disease, recursive partitioning analysis, radiation dose, treatment, number of positive
lymph nodes, and race. Age and KPS variables were not
included in the model, as they formed the components
used to calculate recursive partitioning analysis. Women
with HER-2–positive disease and brain metastases had a
lower risk of death compared with those with hormone receptor–positive/HER-2–negative disease (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.94; P ¼ .02). The risk of
death was not significantly different among women with

hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–negative disease (HR,
0.87; 95%CI, 0.55-1.37; P ¼ .54). In addition, women
with a recursive partitioning analysis score of 3 had a
higher risk of death compared with those with recursive
partitioning analysis scores of 1 or 2 (HR, 3.47; 95% CI,
2.35-5.14; P < .0001), and those receiving whole brain
radiation doses of <30 Gy had a higher risk of death compared with those receiving a dose of 30 Gy (HR, 3.41;
95% CI, 1.56-7.50; P ¼ .002). Other factors significantly
associated with survival after a diagnosis of brain metastases included initial stage of disease and number of
involved lymph nodes.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to determine survival after a
diagnosis of brain metastases and to examine factors that
impact this survival in a contemporary cohort of women
with breast cancer treated with whole brain radiotherapy.
This study is unique in that all patients had known receptor status and received trastuzumab for HER-2þ disease.
Median survival of the whole cohort was 6 months, which
is consistent with previously published studies. Factors

3088

that were found to be associated with a better prognostic
outcome on both univariate and multivariate analyses
were positive HER-2 status of breast tumors, lower recursive partitioning analysis class, and higher dose of
radiotherapy.
By using gene expression profiling, several distinct
intrinsic breast tumor subtypes have been identified,
including hormone receptor-positive subtypes (ie, luminal A and B), basal-like subtype (triple negative), and hormone receptor-negative/HER-2–positive subtype.14,15
Each subtype is associated with a distinct prognostic outcome. Surrogates of these subtypes using IHC have also
been studied classifying tumors based on hormone receptor, HER-2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
and cytokeratin 5/6.16 By using IHC surrogates to classify
breast tumors, Carey et al16 reported on the correlation
between survival and breast tumor subtype in a cohort of
469 women with early stage breast cancer. Patients in this
cohort who had HER-2–positive disease did not receive
trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. The authors observed
that survival was poorest among the women with HER-2–
positive/hormone receptor-negative tumors, followed by
those with basal-like tumors, with the best outcome
observed among women with luminal A and B tumors,

which essentially concurred with the findings of the original gene expression profiling studies. Apart from various
prognostic outcomes, research has also focused on determining the risk of developing brain metastases that is

3090

attached to each subtype. In an earlier study, Pestalozzi
et al17 examined a cohort of 9524 women with early stage
breast cancer who were enrolled in the International
Breast Cancer Study Group clinical trials during the pretrastuzumab era. The authors reported that estrogen receptor-negative disease and HER-2–positive disease were
independently predictive for the development of brain
metastases as the site of first recurrence. In a more recent
study, Heitz et al18 reported that compared with women
with other breast tumor subtypes, women with triple receptor-negative disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.16; 95% CI,
2.26-7.64; P < .001) had the highest odds of developing
brain metastases, followed by those with hormone receptor-negative/HER-2–positive disease (OR, 3.43; 95% CI,
1.46-8.05; P ¼ .005).
With data pointing to the finding that breast tumor subtype influences risk of developing future brain
metastases, the next question was to evaluate whether
these tumor subtypes influenced survival after the development of brain metastases. Nam et al19 recently
reported on prognostic outcome of 126 women with
breast cancer and brain metastases stratified by breast
tumor subtype. Excluding women who had received
trastuzumab after a diagnosis of brain metastases, the
authors reported a median survival of 4.0, 7.3, 3.1, and
3.4 months among women with luminal A, luminal B,
hormone receptor-negative/HER-2–positive, and triplenegative disease, respectively (P ¼ .0448). Studying a
cohort of 222 women with breast cancer and brain metastases, Niwinska and Murawska20 reported median
overall survivals of 3.7, 9, and 15 months among
women with triple-negative, HER-2–positive, and estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-positive HER-2–
negative disease, respectively. Our group previously
reported on a cohort of 598 women with breast cancer
and brain metastases looking specifically at the effect of
the introduction of trastuzumab on the survival outcome after a diagnosis of brain metastases.12 We
reported median survivals of 6.3, 6.1, and 11.6 months,
respectively, among women with HER-2–negative disease, HER-2–positive disease who had never received
trastuzumab, and HER-2–positive disease who had
received trastuzumab either before or at the time of diagnosis of brain metastases (P < .0001).With these
results, we hypothesized that the prognostic outcome
based on breast tumor subtypes may have changed with
the introduction of trastuzumab.
In our present study, we attempted to partially answer this question. Given that whole brain radiation is the

most common treatment for brain metastases, our study
cohort was restricted to women with breast cancer and
brain metastases who had received whole brain radiotherapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, and those with HER-2–positive disease had to
have received trastuzumab. We then stratified women
into 3 groups based on the receptor status of their tumors.
Among women with hormone receptor-positive/HER-2–
negative (surrogate for luminal A tumors), HER-2–positive (a surrogate for a combination of luminal B and
HER-2–positive/hormone receptor-negative tumors),
and triple-negative disease (a surrogate for basal-like
tumors), we observed a median survival of 5, 9, and 5
months, respectively, after a diagnosis of brain metastases
(P ¼ .0069). These results were confirmed in the multivariate analysis, where compared with women with triplenegative disease, women with HER-2–positive disease
had a 37% decreased risk of death after a diagnosis of
brain metastases compared with women with HER-2–
negative disease, which was statistically significant,
whereas among women with triple-negative disease, no
significant difference was observed. Our limited data provide provocative evidence for the finding that at least
within the boundaries of the cohort studied, prognostic
outcome of breast tumor subtypes has changed with the
introduction of trastuzumab, with HER-2–positive
tumors now no longer associated with the poorest outcome. This is somewhat surprising, given that most
patients received trastuzumab after the diagnosis of brain
metastasis, and penetration across the blood-brain barrier
has been questioned for this drug. To truly assess this hypothesis, a larger sample size would be required, including
breast tumors undergoing gene expression profiling or
additional IHC staining for cytokeratin 5/6 and EGFR,
so that true surrogates of luminal A, luminal B, HER-2,
and basal-like subtypes can be obtained.

In the pretrastuzumab era, several studies identified
several additional factors that predict prognostic outcome
among women with breast cancer and brain metastases
who had undergone whole brain radiotherapy.7,9-11 Some
of the most important ones that have been identified
include KPS, age, number of brain metastases, and the
presence of active extracranial disease. Examining data
derived from a database of 3 randomized RTOG trials
and using recursive partitioning analysis, Gaspar et al11
developed a 3-tiered recursive partitioning analysis prognostic index that was based on KPS, primary tumor status,
age of the patient, and presence of extracranial metastases.
The authors observed median survival rates of 7.1, 4.2,
and 2.3 months for patients who were categorized as recursive partitioning analysis class I, II, and III, respectively. Since its development, this prognostic system has
been widely validated.10,21,22 In our study, women categorized as recursive partitioning analysis class I/II and III
had median survival rates of 11 and 2 months, respectively
(P < .0001). After adjusting for several factors, including
breast tumor subtype, recursive partitioning analysis
remained a statistically significant prognostic factor, with
a higher risk of death associated with recursive partitioning analysis class III compared with recursive partitioning
analysis class I/II.
We acknowledge that our study has several important limitations, including it being a retrospective study
and thus subject to all the biases that are inherent to this
type of study. First, all patients received whole brain
radiotherapy, which may itself reflect a bias either toward
patients with more brain metastases who were selected for
whole brain radiotherapy or toward patients with better
performance status able to undergo radiation. In addition,
patients who received <30 Gy to the brain had outcomes
similar to those with untreated brain metastases based on
historical studies. This appears to be an inadequate dose

independent of performance status. However, details as to
why 30 Gy was not received are not available. Patient
choice, toxicity, or deteriorating performance status are
likely and would bias this result. Similarly, although
whole brain radiotherapy without surgery or radiosurgery
was associated with worse outcome on univariate analysis,
this was not significant on multivariate analysis, likely
reflecting a larger disease burden in patients who received
only whole brain radiotherapy. However, despite these
limitations we made several important observations. First,
we observed that breast tumor subtype still plays an important prognostic role after the development of brain
metastases, and we provided provocative evidence that
indicates that the prognostic profile of these breast tumor
subtypes may have changed with the introduction of trastuzumab. The best prognostic group in our cohort was
the group of women who had HER-2–positive disease
and had received trastuzumab. Future studies will need to
focus on this important group to identify additional prognostic factors specific to this cohort. Second, we observed
that factors such as recursive partitioning analysis and
adequate radiation dose continue to be important prognostic factors among women with breast cancer and brain
metastases in the trastuzumab era.
