ABSTRACT
CLL remains an incurable disease in spite of the many new compounds being
studied. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis in all CLL cell types and could
constitute an efficient therapy. To further explore this, we have studied the influence
of stromal cells, key components of the CLL microenvironment, on the response of
CLL cells to ATO. Bone marrow stromal cells induced CLL cell resistance to 2 µM
ATO and led to activation of Lyn, ERK, PI3K and PKC, as well as NF-κB and STAT3.
Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1 were also upregulated after the co-culture. Inhibition
experiments indicated that PI3K and PKC were involved in the resistance to ATO
induced by stroma. Moreover, idelalisib and sotrastaurin, specific inhibitors for PI3Kδ
and PKCβ, respectively, inhibited Akt phosphorylation, NF-κB/STAT3 activation and
Mcl-1 upregulation, and rendered cells sensitive to ATO. Mcl-1 was central to the
mechanism of resistance to ATO, since: 1) Mcl-1 levels correlated with the CLL cell
response to ATO, and 2) blocking Mcl-1 expression or function with specific siRNAs
or inhibitors overcame the protecting effect of stroma. We have therefore identified
the mechanism involved in the CLL cell resistance to ATO induced by bone marrow
stroma and show that idelalisib or sotrastaurin block this mechanism and restore
sensibility to ATO. Combination of ATO with these inhibitors may thus constitute an
efficient treatment for CLL.

INTRODUCTION

development of more specific agents, such as monoclonal
antibodies (obinutuzumab, anti-CD20), kinase inhibitors
(CAL-101/idelalisib, for PI3Kδ; ibrutinib, for Bruton
tyrosine kinase; sotrastaurin, for PKCβ), or Bcl-2
inhibitors (ABT-263, ABT-199) [3, 5]. These agents are
currently in clinical trials or already approved, due to the
promising results in most CLL cases. However, the longterm efficacy of these treatments, particularly in refractory
CLL cases, is not known. It is therefore crucial to continue
searching for new compounds, which could be useful in
the treatment of CLL, especially in the advanced setting.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is
characterized by the accumulation of malignant CD5+ B
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues
[1, 2]. Frontline therapies for CLL have been based in
the administration of cytostatic drugs (chlorambucil,
fludarabine), which, in many cases, control the disease
efficiently and are well tolerated [3]. However, patients
carrying certain prognostic markers, such as del17p13 or
unmutated IgHV, do not respond well to these therapies
[3,  4]. CLL treatment has greatly improved with the

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a successfull treatment
in acute promyelocytic leukemia [6] and is being trialed
in other malignancies, generally in combined therapies
[7, 8]. In the case of CLL, we and others have shown that
ATO effectively induces in vitro apoptosis in all CLL cases
tested, including those with unfavorable prognosis [9, 10].
ATO, alone or in combination with other treatments, could
thus be an efficient therapeutic agent for CLL.
It is now well established that the CLL
microenvironment activate survival pathways on the
malignant cells that favor drug resistance and contribute
to disease progression [11, 12]. Targeting these pathways
has thus become an important issue when studying the
effect of cytotoxic drugs on CLL. For example, CAL101 was shown to down-regulate the chemokine and
B-cell receptor signaling induced by stroma and to
sensitize CLL cells towards bendamustine, fludarabine,
and dexamethasone [13]. Blocking the heat shock protein
90 inhibited the stroma-induced NF-κB signaling and
synergistically enhanced the effect of fludarabine [14].
Likewise, blocking PI3K activity regulated the Akt/
FoxO3a/Bim axis and increased the cytotoxic effect of
fludarabine and bendamustine on CLL cells cultured on
stroma [15].
Whether stromal cells influence the response of CLL
cells to ATO has not been carefully studied. We recently
showed that matrix metalloproteinase-9, a common
component of the CLL microenvironment, contributes to
the CLL resistance to ATO and fludarabine by preventing
downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2
family [16]. Complete understanding of how stromal cells
protect CLL cells from the action of ATO will allow the
development of strategies that overcome this protection.
In the present report we have studied the survival
mechanisms induced by stromal cells, responsible for the
CLL resistance to ATO. We have also studied whether
the modulation of these mechanisms renders CLL cells
sensitive to ATO in the presence of stromal cells.

observed at earlier times. Co-culture with HS-5 cells
significantly protected CLL cells against the cytotoxic
effect of ATO. This was already observed using 1  µM
ATO and it was clearly obvious with 2 µM, which only
reduced CLL cell viability to 69% (24 h) and 54% (48 h)
(Figure 1A). All subsequent experiments were therefore
performed using 2 µM ATO.
We next study whether HS-27A cells (epithelioid
properties [17, 18]) also protected CLL cells from the
action of ATO. HS-27A cells prevented CLL apoptosis
induced by ATO in the 8 samples studied. Indeed, in the
presence of 2  µM ATO, average viability values were
71% (24 h) and 67% (48 h), compared to 26% and 13%,
respectively, for suspended cells (Figure 1B).
We also tested the effect of culturing CLL cells on
primary stroma derived from a CLL patient. Figure 1C
shows that primary stroma also protected CLL cells
(6 different patients) from ATO-induced apoptosis, since
after 24 h, 2 µM ATO only decreased CLL cell viability
to 79%, compared to 37% for suspended cells. After 48 h
exposure to 2 µM ATO, these values were 61% and 14%,
respectively, for stroma-cultured or suspended CLL cells
(Figure 1C). In control experiments, 2 µM ATO was not
cytotoxic for HS-5, HS-27A or primary stromal cells,
measured after 24 or 48 h (Figure 1D). Altogether these
results indicated that stromal cells overcame the apoptotic
effect of ATO on CLL cells, thus contributing to their
survival and drug resistance.

The protecting effect against ATO induced by
stroma involves interactions with CLL cells
through α4β1 and αLβ2 integrins
We next studied whether physical contact between
CLL and stroma was necessary for the observed survival
effect. Because the α4β1 and αLβ2 integrins, present
on CLL cells, contribute to these interactions [12], we
examined the effect of blocking these integrins on the
CLL response to ATO. CLL cells were treated with anti-α4
or anti-β2 blocking antibodies and incubated with HS-5
stromal cells for 48 h, in the absence or presence of ATO.
The average viability of control cells (without antibody
treatment) at this time was 68% and was normalized
to 100. In the absence of ATO, blocking α4β1 or αLβ2
integrins did not significantly reduce the viability of CLL
cells co-cultured with HS-5 stromal cells (Figure  2A).
However, in the presence of ATO the anti-α4 and anti-β2
integrin antibodies significantly reduced cell viability to
53% and 57%, respectively, while control antibodies had
no effect (Figure 2A). The simultaneous blocking of both
integrins increased this effect, decreasing the viability of
CLL cells to 32% (Figure 2A).
Similar results were obtained for CLL cells cultured
on HS-27A stromal cells (Figure 2B). In this case, in the
presence of ATO, the anti-α4 antibody was even more
effective than in HS-5 co-cultures, reducing cell viability

RESULTS
Stromal cells protect CLL cells from the
apoptotic effect of ATO
To determine if different types of stromal cells
influenced the response of CLL cells to ATO, we studied
the effect of ATO in co-cultures of CLL-bone marrow
stromal cells. In initial experiments, CLL cells from 9
different samples were cultured in suspension or with
HS-5 cells (fibroblastoid properties [17, 18]) and treated
with 1 or 2 µM ATO. The average constitutive viability
of these samples was 82% (range 70–92%) and was
normalized to 100. ATO reduced the viability of suspended
cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in 32% (24 h)
and 12% (48 h) viable cells, upon exposure to 2 µM ATO
(Figure 1A). No significant decrease in cell viability was

to 37% and to 28% when combined with anti-β2 antibody
(Figure  2B). The higher effect of the anti-α4 antibody
was probably due to the high levels of VCAM-1 (α4β1
ligand) expressed by HS-27A cells upon stimulation
with TNFα ([18] and Figure 2C). In contrast, VCAM-1
was not induced on HS-5 cells (Figure 2C). Additionally,

the anti-α4 or β2 integrin antibodies did not reduce the
viability of HS-5 or HS-27A stromal cells, either in the
absence or presence of ATO (Figure 2D).
We next determined whether the requirement for
direct interactions between CLL and stromal cells was a
characteristic of the response to ATO or common to other

Regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins in CLL cells
co-cultured with stromal cells and exposed to ATO

cytotoxic agents, such as fludarabine. In the absence of
stroma, 5 µM fludarabine reduced the viability of CLL
cells from 72% to 33% (average of 3 samples) after 48 h.
At this time, the average viability of control cells cocultured with stroma was 82% (HS-5 cells) and 84% (HS27A cells) and was normalized to 100. HS-5 (Figure 2E)
and HS-27A (Figure 2F) cells protected CLL cells from
the effect of fludarabine, resulting in 85% and 91% viable
cells (compared to normalized control), respectively. As in
the case of ATO, the anti-α4 or anti-β2 antibodies partially
restored the sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine in the
presence of both types of stromal cells (Figure 2E, 2F).
The simultaneous blocking of both integrins was more
effective, reducing CLL cell viability to 20% (HS-5 cocultures, Figure  2E) and to 31% (HS-27A co-cultures,
Figure 2F). Therefore, CLL-stromal cell contact via
integrins appears to be a general requirement for the
drug resistance effect of stroma. Because HS-5 and HS27A cells behave similarly, subsequent experiments were
performed with HS-27A cells.

To further characterize the mechanisms of resistance
to ATO induced by stroma, we studied the regulation of
Bcl-2 family proteins [23]. CLL cells were cultured alone
or with HS-27A cells and treated or not with 2 µM ATO
for 24 h. Figure 4 shows the Western blotting results of a
representative patient and the quantitation of all patients
studied. In suspended CLL cells, ATO significantly
diminished the expression of Mcl-1 and Bfl-1 (antiapoptotic) and upregulated Bim and Noxa (pro-apoptotic),
compared to control cells (Figure  4A). This correlated
with the lower viability after 24  h of cells treated with
ATO (34%) compared to control cells (65%).
Co-culturing CLL cells with HS-27A cells, resulted
in a significant increase of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and Bfl-1,
and these proteins remained elevated in the presence of
2  µM ATO (Figure  4A). Stromal cells also prevented
the upregulation of Bim and Noxa by ATO (Figure 4A),
in correlation with the elevated viability (average 56%)
observed on these cells. Moreover, the ratios of antiapoptotic/pro-apoptotic well-known partners [23] were
also significantly increased by stroma and remained
elevated upon ATO treatment (Figure  4B). Altogether
these results suggested that Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1 were
possible contributors to the resistance of CLL cells to ATO
induced by stroma.

Survival pathways induced by co-culturing
CLL cells with stromal cells and effect of ATO
treatment
To determine the survival mechanisms contributing
to CLL cell resistance to ATO, we first analyzed the
possible activation of protein kinases relevant for CLL
viability [19]. CLL cells were cultured in suspension or
with HS-27A cells for 24 h in the absence or presence of
ATO. Western blotting analyses showed that, in cultures
of CLL cells alone, ATO significantly reduced the
phosphorylation of Akt, PKC, and Lyn, compared to the
values of control cells (Figure 3A). In correlation with this,
the average viability of these cells decreased from 64%
(no ATO) to 28% (ATO treated). Phosphorylated ERK was
hardly detectable under these conditions in the samples
studied. Co-culturing CLL cells with stroma resulted in the
significant activation of Akt, PKC, ERK and Lyn. These
kinases remained phosphorylated after 24 h, even in the
presence of ATO, indicating their sustained activation by
stroma (Figure 3A).
We also examined the activation of NF-κB and
STAT3, two transcription factors important for CLL
cell survival [20, 21]. NF-κB activation was measured
based on the phosphorylation levels of the associated
inhibitory protein IκB [22]. The basal phosphorylation
of IκB and STAT3 on suspended CLL cells was low
and did not change in the presence of ATO (Figure 3B).
Phospho-IκB and phospho-STAT3 were significantly
increased by stroma and remained elevated upon
treatment with 2 µM ATO (Figure 3B). Altogether these
results indicated that the survival pathways induced by
stroma on CLL cells were not suppressed by treatment
with 2 µM ATO.

Involvement of the PI3K and PKC signaling
pathways in the stroma-induced resistance of
CLL cells to ATO
To determine which of the survival pathways
described above was responsible for the resistance of
CLL cells to ATO, we first blocked protein kinases and
transcription factors with specific inhibitors. Except for
Stattic, that was used at 2.5 µM, the inhibitors were used
at 5 µM. This concentration had little effect on basal cell
viability (see below) but it was sufficient to inhibit kinase
phosphorylation [10, 21]. CLL cells were incubated with
inhibitors or vehicle for 1 h prior to culturing with HS27A cells for 24 h, in the absence or presence of 2 µM
ATO. The viability of untreated CLL cells cultured with
stromal cells for 24  h (40%–75%) was normalized to
100. Figure 5A shows that in the absence of ATO, only
the inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 or STAT3 with
Stattic had a limited effect, reducing cell viability to 83%
and 72%, respectively. However, in the presence of ATO,
blocking PI3K, Akt, PKC, NF-κB or STAT3 activities
significantly overcame the survival effect induced by
stromal cells (Figure 5A). In contrast, inhibiting MEK/
ERK with UO126 or Lyn with PP2 had no effect, albeit
these inhibitors efficiently blocked the phosphorylation of
these kinases (Figure 5A).

Blocking the PI3Kδ or PKCβ signaling pathways
prevents Mcl-1 upregulation and the resistance
to ATO induced by stromal cells

The above results established that PI3K and
PKC signaling were essential for the resistance to ATO
induced by stroma. Because PI3Kδ and PKCβ are major
isoforms in CLL cells and current targets in clinical trials
[3, 5, 24, 25], we tested the effect of specifically blocking
these isoforms in our system. CLL cells were treated or
not with various concentrations of idelalisib or sotrastaurin
and cultured with HS-27A cells for 24 h, with or without
2 µM ATO. Figure 5B, 5C shows that, in the absence of
ATO, these inhibitors decreased less than 20% the viability
of CLL cells cultured on stromal cells. However, in the
presence of ATO, idelalisib and sotrastaurin significantly
reduced CLL cell viability in a dose-dependent manner,
while UO126 behave as the control with no inhibitors
(Figure 5B, 5C). The calculated combination index in
these assays was < 1 for all concentrations of idelalisib
and sotrastaurin tested (Figure  5D, 5E), indicating a
synergistic cooperation between ATO and these inhibitors.
Blocking PI3Kδ and PKCβ activities simultaneously did
not significantly increase the effect of each individual
inhibitor (not shown).

To confirm the involvement of PI3Kδ and PKCβ in
the resistance to ATO, we first studied whether idelalisib
and sotrastaurin inhibited the activation of Akt, NF-κB
and STAT3 (see Figure 5A). Both inhibitors were used
at 2.5 µM and activation of Akt was determined by the
phosphorylation of the S473  residue, a target of PI3K
and PKC [26,  27]. The viability of control cells (no
inhibitors or ATO) in these experiments was 60% and
was normalized to 100. In the presence of ATO, idelalisib
and sotrastaurin significantly reduced the stromainduced phosphorylation of S473-Akt, IκB and STAT3
(Figure 6A). The decrease in S473-Akt phosphorylation
was also observed on control CLL cells unexposed to
ATO (Figure 6A). However, only in the presence of this
agent the dephosphorylation of S473-Akt, STAT3 and
IκB correlated with a significant reduction in cell viability
to 52% (idelalisib) and 49% (sotrastaurin) (Figure 6B).

× 106 CLL cells in RPMI/0.1% FBS were cultured in suspension or over HS-27A cells for 2 h at 37ºC. 2 µM ATO was added or not and

representative samples and the quantitation of all samples analyzed, after normalizing control values to 1, are shown. Vinculin was also

Blocking MEK with UO126 had no effect (Figure 6A),
confirming the specific involvement of PI3Kδ and PKCβ
in the mechanism of resistance to ATO.
Further analysis of the same samples demonstrated
that idelalisib and sotrastaurin significantly downregulated
Mcl-1, both in untreated and ATO-treated cells, while
UO126 did not (Figure 6A). As above, only in the presence
of ATO, downregulation of Mcl-1 correlated with a
decrease in cell viability (Figure 6B). Moreover, idelalisib
and sotrastaurin did not significantly reduce the expression
of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 or Bfl-1 (Figure 6A), suggesting a role
for Mcl-1 in the resistance to ATO induced by stroma. The
pro-apoptotic proteins Bim, Noxa, Bax and Puma did not
change under these conditions (Figure 6A).
To then determine whether PI3Kδ and PKCβ
regulated Mcl-1 via NF-κB and/or STAT3, we examined
the effect of inhibiting these transcription factors.
Blocking NF-κB or STAT3  resulted in a significant

decrease of Mcl-1, in untreated and ATO-treated cells,
while Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 remained unchanged (Figure 6C).
Again, the decrease of Mcl-1 correlated with reduced
cell viability (55% and 48%, respectively for NF-κB
and STAT3 inhibition) only in cells exposed to ATO. In
contrast, downregulation of Mcl-1 did not decreased cell
viability on control cells (89.5% and 80.2%, respectively,
for NF-κB and STAT3 inhibition).

Key role for Mcl-1 in the resistance of CLL cells
to ATO induced by stromal cells
The above results strongly suggested that Mcl1 downregulation was due to inhibition of the PI3Kδ/
PKCβ-NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathways, rather than
a mere consequence of cell death. To confirm this, we
measured Mcl-1 levels at shorter times of cell exposure
to idelalisib or sotrastaurin, in the absence or presence

(Figure 7C).
To further establish the crucial role of Mcl-1 in the
stroma-induced CLL cell resistance to ATO, we blocked
the expression or function of this molecule with specific
siRNAs or inhibitors. CLL cells (4 different samples)
were nucleofected with Mcl-1 or control siRNAs and
co-cultured with HS-27A cells for 24 h, with or without
ATO. In suspended CLL cells, gene silencing Mcl-1
decreased cell viability to < 10% after 24 h, confirming the
importance of Mcl-1 in preventing spontaneous apoptosis
of these cells. Western blotting analyses confirmed that the
Mcl-1 siRNA significantly reduced Mcl-1 expression in
untreated (50% average reduction) or ATO-treated (70%
average reduction) cells, compared to control values
normalized to 1 (Figure 7D). Because of the stringency
of the nucleofection procedure, the viability of CLL cells
transfected with control siRNA was 36% after the 24 h
co-culture, and this was normalized to 100. Treatment of

of ATO. After 3 h of treatment, Mcl-1 expression started
to decrease and was reduced 1.8-fold after 8 h in ATOtreated samples (Figure 7A). Cell viability at these times
remained unchanged (Figure 7B). After 24 h of treatment,
Mcl-1 decreased both in control cells and in ATO-treated
cells (Figure  7A). However, only the viability of cells
exposed to ATO was significantly reduced at this time, in
correlation with the decrease Mcl-1 levels (Figure 7B).
Bim expression was also analyzed at these times but no
significant changes were observed (Figure  7A). These
results strongly suggested that downregulation of Mcl-1
preceded the onset of apoptosis induced by ATO.
We next studied whether there was a direct
correlation between Mcl-1 expression and cell viability.
CLL cells were treated or not with various concentrations
of idelalisib or sotrastaurin and cultured with stromal cells,
with or without ATO. UO126 was added as a control in

these cells with 2 µM ATO did not reduce this viability,
confirming the protection of stromal cells against this
agent (Figure  7E). In contrast, transfection with Mcl-1
siRNA diminished the viability of CLL cells unexposed
to ATO to 57.1% (compared to normalized control)
(Figure  7E), again reflecting the importance of Mcl-1
in basal cell survival. Exposure to ATO further reduced
this viability to 36.5% (compared to normalized control)
(Figure 7E). To determine if this was due to the net effect
of ATO, we used cells transfected with control siRNA and
kept in suspension as a control system. ATO reduced the
viability of these cells from 52% to 29% (Figure 7E), and
this difference (23%) was very similar to that observed for
Mcl-1 siRNA-transfected cells cultured on stroma (19%)
(Figure 7E). These results confirmed that the lack of Mcl-1
nearly completely restored the sensitivity of CLL cells to
ATO in the presence of stroma.
We also study the effect of blocking Mcl-1
function with the specific inhibitor MIM1. CLL cells
were incubated with various concentrations of vehicle
or MIM1 prior to their culture with stromal cells and
treatment with 2 µM ATO. Figure 7F shows that MIM1
sensitized CLL cells to ATO in a dose-dependent manner,
reducing cell viability to 29% at the highest concentration
tested. To confirm that this was due to Mcl-1, we analyzed
by Western blotting the expression of Mcl-1 on the
samples treated with MIM1. Figure 7G shows that MIM1
specifically induced the degradation Mcl-1 but not Bcl-xL
or Bcl-2, used as controls. Altogether these results
established a central role for Mcl-1 in the mechanism
of resistance to ATO induced by stromal cells. Figure 8
shows a schematic representation of this mechanism,
including the identified survival signals induced by stroma
and how their inhibition will render CLL cells sensitive
to ATO.

α4β1 and αLβ2 integrins was sufficient to overcome
the protective effect of stroma. This is agreement with
previous studies showing a role for β1 and β2 integrins
in the microenvironment-induced survival of CLL cells
[29,  30]. Besides the well-known ligands for these
integrins (VCAM-1, fibronectin, ICAM-1) present in
bone marrow stroma, an additional cell-cell interaction
contributing to the survival effect may be provided by
MMP-9. MMP-9 is also present in stroma, is a ligand
for α4β1 [31], and has a reported protective role against
ATO [16].
It is now well established that co-culturing CLL cells
with stromal cells results in reciprocal activation of several
signaling pathways, which promote cell survival and drug
resistance [12, 32]. In our study, we detected activation
of the Lyn, ERK, Akt and PKC kinases, as well as of the
transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3. We and others
have reported a role for Lyn in CLL cell survival [21, 33].
However, our present results show that Lyn (or ERK)
was not involved in the mechanism of resistance of CLL
cells to ATO induced by stroma. In contrast, inhibition
of PI3K (upstream of Akt) or PKC activities overcame
the protective effect of stroma and rendered CLL cells
sensitive to ATO. PI3K and PKC were previously shown
to play important roles in the survival of suspended CLL
cells induced by IL-4 or phorbol esters [34]. Likewise,
PI3K and PKC also mediated the survival signals induced
by BCR, adhesion molecules and chemokines [35, 36].
Additionally, several inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt and PKC
pathways have rendered promising results in vitro and in
vivo, and may potentially have therapeutic application in
CLL [5, 37, 38]. Our present results reveal new functions
for PI3K and PKC in the resistance of CLL cells to ATO,
highlighting the role of these kinases in the response to
several cytotoxic drugs.
Further insight into the mechanism of resistance to
ATO induced by stroma was obtained by using idelalisib
and sotrastaurin as inhibitors for the PI3Kδ and PKCβ
isoforms, respectively. The study of these isoforms was
chosen because of their predominant expression in CLL
and their well-established role in CLL cell survival,
as effectors of the B-cell receptor. Indeed, both PI3Kδ
and PKCβ are either directly associated to the B-cell
receptor (PI3Kδ), or activated by Bruton tyrosine
kinase (BTK), another B-cell receptor-associated kinase
(PKCβ) [24,  25,  39]. Idelalisib has recently entered
clinical trials for CLL [3] and sotrastaurin has yielded
very promising preclinical results [5]. Notably, PKCβdependent activation of NF-κB has been shown to be
crucial for induction of CLL survival by stromal cells
[40]. Our present results show that blocking PI3Kδ
and PKCβ activities was sufficient to inhibit further
downstream signaling (Akt, NF-κB, STAT3 activation)
and to overcome the survival effect of stroma. PI3Kδ and
PKCβ are therefore key survival pathways in the response
of CLL cells to ATO in the presence of stromal cells. The

DISCUSSION
We previously showed that ATO could constitute
an efficient treatment in CLL, particularly in combined
therapies [10, 16, 28]. To further explore the potential
clinical use of this agent, we have now studied the
influence of bone marrow stromal cells on the response of
CLL cells to ATO. We report that: 1) stromal cells induce
CLL cell resistance to ATO via activation of the PI3KδPKCβ/STAT3-NF-κB pathways; 2) Mcl-1 plays a central
role in the mechanism of resistance to ATO; 3) blocking
PI3Kδ and PKCβ with specific inhibitors overcomes the
survival effect of stroma on CLL cells exposed to ATO.
The three types of stromal cells used in study,
whether fibroblastoid-like, epithelioid-like or derived
from a CLL bone marrow sample, protected CLL cells
from the apoptotic action of ATO. This protection mostly
involved physical cell-cell contact. Among the several
receptor-ligand interactions that take place between CLL
and stromal cells [12], our results show that blocking

fact that we did not observe an additive or synergistic
effect when idelalisib and sotrastaurin were used together,
suggests that PI3Kδ and PKCβ are independently activated
but converge in subsequent signaling. Indeed, both kinases
can directly or indirectly phosphorylate Akt at T308 and/
or S473 [26,  41], and activate the transcription factors
NF-κB and STAT3 [40, 42]. Additionally, since BTK is
upstream of the PKCβ signaling pathway, it is possible
that ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor approved for treatment of
CLL [12], will also render CLL cells sensitive to ATO in
the presence of stroma.
We have further characterized the mechanism of
resistance to ATO induced by stroma by studying the
regulation of proteins from the Bcl-2 family. In agreement
with our previous observations on the protective role of
MMP-9 against ATO [16], our results show that ATO did
not increase the pro-apoptotic members Bim, Bax, Noxa
or Puma in CLL-stromal cell co-cultures. This differs from
the previously described upregulation of some of these

proteins by ATO in myeloma [43] and ovarian cancer
cells [44]. With regard to the anti-apoptotic members of
the Bcl-2 family, our study clearly demonstrates a central
role for Mcl-1 in the mechanism of resistance to ATO.
This is based on the following evidences: First, Mcl-1 was
upregulated by stroma and remained high in the presence
of ATO. Second, idelalisib and sotrastaurin decreased
Mcl-1 expression in CLL-stromal cell co-cultures treated
with ATO, in correlation with a reduced CLL cell viability.
Third, inhibition of NF-κB and STAT3, known to regulate
Mcl-1 [45], also decreased Mcl-1 levels. This confirmed
the involvement of these transcription factors in the
mechanism of resistance to ATO and the transcriptional
regulation of Mcl-1 by stroma. Fourth, gene silencing
Mcl-1 or inhibiting its function, overcame the resistance
to ATO induced by stroma. Mcl-1 is a key survival
molecule in CLL, recently shown to undergo complex
regulation in the context of bone marrow stroma [46].
Indeed, upregulation of Mcl-1 by stroma is central to the

Figure 8: Schematic representation of the identified mechanism of stroma-induced resistance of CLL cells to ATO.

CLL cells bind to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) via several molecular interactions, including those mediated by integrins. The
survival pathways induced by stroma involved in the resistance of CLL cells to ATO are depicted. PI3Kδ and PKCβ play major roles in this
mechanism and increase Mcl-1 expression. Blocking these kinases with idelalisib and sotrastaurin, or Mcl-1 with specific inhibitors, may
be useful strategies to overcome this resistance and render CLL cells sensitive to ATO.

protective effect against CLL cell spontaneous apoptosis
or apoptosis induced by fludarabine [47], fludarabine/
bendamustine [48], or Bcl-2-directed compounds [49]. We
also recently reported a role for Mcl-1 in the protection
against ATO induced by MMP-9 on CLL cells [16]. Our
present results establish that Mcl-1 is a main target to
overcome the survival effect of stroma and render CLL
cells sensitive to ATO.
In summary, we report for the first time that the
mechanism by which bone marrow stromal cells induce
resistance of CLL cells to ATO consists in activation of
the PI3Kδ-PKCβ/NF-κB-STAT3/Mcl-1 pathways. We
further show that the specific inhibitors idelalisib (PI3Kδ)
or sotrastaurin (PKCβ), as well as the BH3-mimetic MIM1
overcome the stroma-induced resistance to this agent.
Given the promising results obtained with idelalisib and
sotrastaurin and the effectiveness of low concentrations
of ATO in all types of CLL [9, 10], the combination of
ATO with these inhibitors (or with BH3-mimetics) may
represent an efficient alternative for the clinical treatment
of this malignancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and cells
Approval was obtained from the CSIC Bioethics
Review Board for these studies. All patients signed an
informed consent before blood was drawn. B-lymphocytes
were purified from the 48 CLL samples listed in
Table 1, using Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) centrifugation and, if necessary,
negative selection with anti-CD3-conjugated Dynabeads
(Invitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway). The resulting B
cell population was mostly >90% CD19+, determined
on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Primary stromal cells (BMSC)
were obtained from a bone marrow sample of a CLL
patient after 3 week culture in IMDM (Lonza, Amboise,
France)/20% FBS, and maintained for up to 4 weeks
in IMDM/15% FBS. The HS-5 stromal cell line, with
fibroblastoid properties [17, 18], was obtained from Dr.
Atanasio Pandiella (Cancer Research Center, Salamanca,
Spain). The HS-27A stromal cell line, with epithelioid
properties and functionally different than HS-5 cells
[17, 18] was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).
Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI/10% FBS.

CLL-stromal cell co-culture
Bone marrow stromal cells were seeded onto
gelatin-coated wells of 96- or 6-well plates. After
4–6 h, HS-27A cells were stimulated with 15–20 ng/ml
TNFα overnight at 37ºC,  5% CO2, to induce VCAM-1
expression. CLL cells (2–5 × 106/ml), with or without
previous incubation for 1 h with antibodies or inhibitors,
were added to the confluent stromal cell monolayers
or cultured in suspension for comparison. After 2 h at
37ºC, 2 µM ATO was added or not to the cultures and cells
further incubated for various times. CLL cells were gently
collected with culture medium for further analysis. The
integrity of the stromal cell monolayer was confirmed by
phase contrast microscopy. The presence of stromal cells
on CLL cell preparations, determined by flow cytometry,
was < 1%.

(Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For cooperativity
analyses, CLL cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of idelalisib or sotrastaurin prior to the
addition of 2 μM ATO, and cell viability was determined
after 24  h. Synergism or additivity between ATO and
these inhibitors was determined using the CompuSyn

on the algorithm of Chou and Talalay (50). Combination

between cell viability in response to ATO and Mcl-1

coefficient (r) indicates that 0.10 < r < 0.29 represents a
weak correlation; 0.30 < r < 0.49 represents a moderate
correlation; and coefficients > 0.50  represent a strong
correlation. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
