The Evolution and Clinical Relevance of Prognostic
Classification Systems in Myelofibrosis
Prithviraj Bose, MD; and Srdan Verstovsek, MD, PhD

Primary myelofibrosis, the most aggressive of the classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is
a clonal disorder characterized by often debilitating constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and resultant
cytopenias, extramedullary hematopoiesis, risk of leukemic transformation, and shortened survival. Post-polycythemia vera and postessential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis represent similar entities, although some differences are being recognized. Attempts to
classify patients with myelofibrosis into prognostic categories have been made since the late 1980s, and these scoring systems continue to evolve as new information becomes available. Over the last decade, the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs has been elucidated
considerably, and the Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is the first drug specifically approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration to treat patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelofibrosis. This article reviews the evolution of prognostic criteria in myelofibrosis, emphasizing the major systems widely in use today, as well as recently described, novel systems that incorporate emerging data regarding somatic mutations. Risk factors for thrombosis and conversion to MPN blast phase also are discussed.
Finally, the practical usefulness of the current prognostic classification systems in terms of clinical decision making is discussed, parC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Myelofibrosis (MF), whether arising de novo (primary myelofibrosis [PMF]) or from essential thrombocythemia (ET) or
polycythemia vera (PV), is a clonal Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, constitutional symptoms, an increased risk of leukemic transformation (LT), and shortened survival.1 In 2010, there were an estimated 13,000 individuals with MF living
in the United States, for a prevalence of approximately 4 to 6 cases per 100,000 population.2 The symptom burden of MF
is significant, and can be attributed to cytokine excess, splenomegaly, thrombotic complications, and cytopenias.2 The
median survival of patients with PMF, although much worse than that of those with ET or PV, has improved over the
years to 6.5 years among patients diagnosed between 1996 and 2007,3 but considerable heterogeneity exists, and survival
can range from months to many years.4 It is interesting to note that this improvement in survival was restricted to patients
with lower-risk disease (ruxolitinib, which was approved in 2011 for patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk MF based
on the COMFORT [COntrolled MyeloFibrosis Study With ORal JAK Inhibitor Treatment] trials,5,6 has demonstrated
a survival advantage when compared with matched historical controls in multiple studies7,8). Importantly, clarification of
2 disease entities, namely prefibrotic MF and post-ET/PV MF, has helped in recent years to better define the clinical presentation and course of patients with MF.
Early/prefibrotic MF, an entity with a very indolent phenotype, is included within the current (2008) World Health
Organization (WHO) definition of PMF (Table 1),9 and requires careful pathologic distinction from ET, with which it
has several key differences (Table 2).10-15
Diagnostic criteria for post-PV and post-ET MF have been proposed by the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT)16 to aid in differentiating patients with advanced ET or PV from those

previously documented diagnosis of WHO-defined PV or
ET and bone marrow fibrosis, patients must meet at least
2 additional criteria (Table 3).9,16-18
Early Studies of Prognostic Factors in MF

Unlike ET, which is associated with an essentially normal
life expectancy, and PV, in which there is a slight reduction
in survival, PMF is associated with a substantial reduction
in life expectancy in comparison with age-matched and sexmatched controls from the general population.19 Anemia
(hemoglobin [Hgb] < 10 g/dL), leukocytosis, age, constitutional symptoms, circulating blasts, abnormal karyotype,
percentage of blood myeloid precursors, thrombocytopenia, number of circulating progenitors, monocyte count,
and even sex have been identified as adversely affecting survival in various series.20 The Lille scoring system, published
in 1996 and based on just 2 adverse prognostic factors, ane682

because of its simplicity and was widely adopted.21
Although many adverse prognostic factors for survival were
identified from this cohort of 195 patients with PMF who
were diagnosed between 1962 and 1992, the new scoring
system was able to separate patients in 3 groups with low (0
factors), intermediate (1 factor), or high (2 factors) risk,
which were associated with median survivals of 93 months,
26 months, and 13 months, respectively.21

(IPSS) in 2009.4 The IPSS was developed based on characteristics present at the time of diagnosis in 1054 consecutive patients diagnosed with PMF at 7 centers, which
was a major advancement over previous, mostly singlecenter, studies involving far fewer patients. Patients with
post-PV/ET MF and early/prefibrotic PMF were
excluded. On multivariate analysis, age >65 years, constitutional symptoms, Hgb <10 g/dL, leukocyte count >
25 3 109/L, and circulating blasts 1% predicted shorter
survival.4 Assigning 1 point to each of these variables,
patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 of these risk factors were
found to have median survivals of 135 months, 95
months, 48 months, and 27 months, respectively, delineating 4 clearly separate risk groups (low, intermediate-1,
intermediate-2, and high). Adverse cytogenetics also were
found to be associated with shorter survival, but were independently prognostic only in the intermediate-risk
groups.4 Patients without splenomegaly at the time of diagnosis had superior survival compared with those with
splenomegaly, but the difference was not statistically significant, and the addition of splenomegaly as a variable
did not improve the IPSS score. The IWG-MRT then
developed a dynamic prognostic model, the Dynamic
IPSS (DIPSS), which could be used at any time point in
the course of the patients’ disease, by evaluating the IPSS
prognostic factors at later time points than at diagnosis.22
Time to acquisition of the previously defined IPSS risk
factors was recorded in 525 patients. Multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression including the IPSS parameters as time-dependent covariates revealed that the
acquisition of disease-related anemia over time affected
survival with a hazard ratio that was approximately double
that of the other IPSS parameters. Therefore, in the final
DIPSS model, a Hgb level <10 g/dL was assigned 2
points, whereas the other IPSS parameters continued to
be assigned 1 point each. Median survival was not reached
in the low-risk group (0 points) and was 14.2 years, 4
years, and 1.5 years, respectively, in the intermediate-1risk (1-2 points), intermediate-2-risk (3-4 points), and
high-risk (5-6 points) groups.22
Younger patients

PMF is uncommon in younger individuals, but because
the risks of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) appear justified in otherwise
transplantation-eligible patients whose expected median
survival is <5 years,1 there has been considerable interest
in accurate prognostication within this group. In earlier
studies, anemia (Hgb < 10 g/dL), constitutional symptoms, circulating blasts (1%), thrombocytopenia (plateCancer

March 1, 2016

let count < 100 3 109/L), and monocytosis (1 3 109/L)
at the time of presentation were identified as adverse prognostic factors.20 Among systems currently in use, the ageadjusted DIPSS is geared specifically toward patients aged
<65 years.22 The same 4 factors (other than age) as in the
IPSS/DIPSS are included in this model; however,
Hgb < 10 g/dL, circulating blasts  1%, and the presence
of constitutional symptoms are each assigned 2 points,
whereas 1 point is assigned to leukocyte count >25 3 109/
L. The median survival times for this younger group of
patients were not reached, 9.8 years, 4.8 years, and 2.3 years
in the low-risk (0 points), intermediate-1-risk (1-2 points),
intermediate-2-risk (3-4 points), and high-risk (>4 points)
groups, respectively.22
Post-PV and Post-ET MF

In a study of 66 young (aged<60 years) patients with secondary MF (37 with post-PV and 29 with post-ET MF),
unfavorable cytogenetics (abnormalities other than
del13q or del20q), older age, Hgb <10 g/dL, and evolution from PV were found to be independent risk factors
for shortened survival.23 However, when the analysis was
restricted to only those patients in whom cytogenetic
studies had been performed (31 patients), the presence of
unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities became the only
adverse prognostic factor for survival.23 A potential limitation of the IPSS/DIPSS is their exclusive focus on PMF.
To address this issue, Passamonti et al published a
dynamic prognostic model to predict survival in patients
with post-PV MF.24 They reported a dynamic score based
on a Hgb level <10 g/dL, platelet count < 100 3 109/L,
and leukocyte count >30 3 109/L that could predict survival at any time from the diagnosis of post-PV MF. In
addition, they found leukocytosis >15 3 109/L at the
time of diagnosis of PV to be a risk factor for the development of post-PV MF.24 A Spanish retrospective study
evaluated the performance of the IPSS in a large cohort of
patients with post-PV (61 patients) or post-ET (115
patients) MF.25 They found no statistically significant difference in survival between the low-risk and intermediate1-risk IPSS categories, or between the intermediate-1-risk
and intermediate-2-risk categories, whereas the high-risk
group had significantly poorer survival than the
intermediate-2-risk group. In addition, constitutional
symptoms and leukocytosis lacked prognostic value,
whereas thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 3 109/L)
and receiving hydroxyurea at the time of diagnosis of MF
emerged as additional unfavorable prognostic factors in
this analysis.25

DIPSS-plus and beyond

Although not included in the IPSS or DIPSS, several studies have documented the prognostic relevance of cytogenetic abnormalities in PMF. A study of 256 patients seen
at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston found that patients with favorable abnormalities (del13q, del20q, and trisomy 9) had survival times
that were similar to those of patients with diploid karyotypes (median overall survival [OS], 63 months and 46
months, respectively), whereas those with rearrangements
affecting chromosomes 5 or 7 or with  3 karyotypic
abnormalities had very poor survival (median OS, 15
months; OS was 5 months for patients with chromosome
17 abnormalities).26 A model containing karyotypic
abnormalities, Hgb level, platelet count, and performance
status effectively risk-stratified patients at the time of the
initial evaluation. In addition, assessment of clonal evolution suggested the potential role of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities as a risk factor applicable at any time
in the disease course.26 Other studies have confirmed the
IPSS-independent prognostic value of cytogenetic risk
categorization (5-year survival rates of 8% for patients
with unfavorable and 51% for patients with favorable
karyotypes) and noted additional favorable (eg, chromosome 1 translocations/duplications) and unfavorable (eg,
trisomy 8) abnormalities.27,28 Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 3 109/L)28,29 and red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion dependence, both at the time of diagnosis and
at later timepoints,30,31 have also been found to correlate
with inferior survival in an IPSS/DIPSS-independent
fashion. These observations led to the development of the
DIPSS-plus, which incorporates karyotype, platelet
count, and RBC transfusion status.32 In this model, the
DIPSS low-risk, intermediate-1-risk, intermediate-2-risk,
684

and high-risk categories were assigned 0, 1, 2, and 3 points,
respectively, whereas unfavorable karyotype (complex or a
single or 2 abnormalities including 1 8, -7/7q-, i(17)q, -5/
5q-, 12p-, inv(3), or 11q23 rearrangements), a platelet
count <100 3 109/L, and RBC transfusion dependence33
were assigned 1 point each. Patients are categorized as having low-risk (0 points), intermediate-1-risk (1 point),
intermediate-2-risk (2-3 points), or high-risk (4-6 points)
disease. Among 793 patients, the median survival times in
these 4 categories were 185 months, 78 months, 35
months, and 16 months, respectively.32 Table 4 lists the
variables included in the IPSS, DIPSS, and DIPSS-plus,
along with the weight assigned to each variable.4,22,32
Increased levels of interleukins (ILs) 8, 10, 12, and 15,
and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) were found to be independently predictive of inferior survival among 127 patients with
PMF, with IL-8, IL-2R, IL-12, and IL-15 levels remaining
significant even when patients were risk-stratified based on
the DIPSS-plus.34 Indeed, a 2-cytokine (IL-8/IL-2R)-based
risk categorization delineated prognostically different
groups within specific DIPSS-plus risk categories.34
Leukemic Transformation (Progression
to Blast Phase)

Patients with Ph- MPNs in blast phase (BP) have a dismal
prognosis, with a median survival of <6 months;
responses to chemotherapy are typically transient and
only a few patients who are able to undergo HSCT may
survive long-term.35-37 The V617F mutation in JAK2
(discussed below), which is present in 50% to 60% of
patients with PMF, is often lost at the time of LT.38 Some
investigators have found the presence of JAK2 V617F to
be highly predictive of LT in patients with PMF,39,40
whereas others have noted no significant difference in

leukemia-free survival (LFS).41 A multicenter, historical
cohort study of 549 patients with PMF reported prior
splenectomy, a platelet count <100 3 109/L, and circulating blasts at the time of diagnosis to be independently
predictive of LT.42 In a single-center study of 311
patients,  3% circulating blasts and/or a platelet count
<100 3 109/L at the time of diagnosis of PMF were
found to be strong and independent predictors of LT.43
Investigators at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center found an intervening accelerated phase
(AP) to be a necessary step in the progression to BP in a
study of 370 consecutive patients with PMF, post-PV
MF, or post-ET MF.44 AP was characterized by 10%
blood or bone marrow blasts, a platelet count <50 3 109/
L, and/or chromosome 17 aberrations, and a median survival of approximately 1 year.44
The DIPSS also has been shown to predict progression to BP in patients with PMF.45 In another study of
172 patients with PMF, time to onset of anemia
(Hgb < 10 g/dL), leukocytosis (>30 3 109/L), thrombocytopenia (<150 3 109/L), and chemotherapy initiation
were found to be prognostic factors for the risk of LT.46
RBC transfusion dependence has been associated with an
increased risk of LT in patients with PMF.47 Unfavorable
karyotype and thrombocytopenia also have been found to
predict LFS.28,32 In an effort to complement the DIPSSplus, researchers at the Mayo Clinic attempted to identify
risk factors that could reliably predict death within the
first 2 years after PMF diagnosis. Risk factors associated
with a 2-year mortality rate of >80% included monosomal karyotype, inv(3)/i(17q), or any 2 of the following:
circulating blasts > 9%, leukocyte count  40 3 109/L,
or other unfavorable karyotype.48 An increased number of
chromosomal aberrations is characteristic of disease progression and LT across MPN subtypes. Specifically, chromosome 1q and 9p abnormalities have been positively
correlated with progression to secondary MF in patients
with PV and ET, and to AP in patients with PMF.49 The
minimal amplified region on chromosome 1q harbors
MDM4, a potent inhibitor of p53 that is often amplified
in several types of cancer.50 In addition, mutations in
TP53,51 IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) 1/2,52 LNK
(encoding a negative regulator of JAK2),53 and IKZF1
(encoding the transcription factor Ikaros)54 have all been
implicated in the LT of patients with Ph- MPNs. In the
large Spanish study of patients with post-ET/PV MF,
thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100 3 109/L) was
found to be the only predictor of progression to Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML).25

Thrombosis in Patients With PMF

Although the clinical management of MF is focused more
on the amelioration of constitutional symptoms, anemia,
and splenomegaly; the prevention of LT; and prolongation of survival than on the prevention of thrombosis as in
ET and PV, the rate of thrombotic events in patients with
MF is comparable to that of patients with ET.2 Cervantes
et al reported an 11.6% incidence of thrombotic events
among 155 patients diagnosed with PMF at a single institution.55 In a study involving 707 patients with PMF
treated across 4 European institutions, fatal and nonfatal
thromboses were documented in 51 patients (7.2%) (ie,
1.75 events per 100 patient-years).56 Table 5 shows the
features found to be predictive of thrombosis on multivariate analysis in these and other studies of patients with
PMF.55-57 Overall, thrombotic risk in patients with PMF
appears to be limited to those with mutated JAK2.58
Mutations and Prognosis in Patients With MF

The discovery in 2005 of the activating V617F mutation
in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 in the majority of
patients with Ph- MPNs was a seminal event that heralded
the beginning of a new era in MPN research.59-62 Unique
to myeloid malignancies, this mutation is present in 95%
of cases of PV and 50% to 60% of cases of ET and
PMF.1,2 Subsequently, gain-of-function mutations (eg,
W515L and W515K) in MPL, the gene encoding the
thrombopoietin receptor, were described in 5% to 10% of
patients with PMF.63-65 Most recently, mutations in exon
9 of the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR), a calciumbinding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein, have
been described in the vast majority of patients with ET
and PMF without the JAK2 mutation.66,67 A central
theme that emerged from these studies was the universal
role of JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of
transcription) signaling in Ph- MPN pathogenesis, a concept that has been validated through integrated genomic
profiling of MPN samples.68 Indeed, the JAK1/2
685

Review Article

inhibitor ruxolitinib has demonstrated sustained efficacy
in patients with MF regardless of JAK2 mutation status,
particularly in terms of spleen shrinkage and improvement in constitutional symptoms and quality of life, while
also providing an OS benefit.69-71 JAK2, CALR, and MPL
represent mutually exclusive “driver” mutations in PhMPNs, with approximately 10% of patients with ET and
PMF having “triple-negative” disease (nearly all cases of
PV are driven by JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutations).
Recently, some experts have called for revision of the
WHO diagnostic criteria for MPNs to include new information regarding somatic mutations.72
JAK2 V617F and prognosis

Several studies have examined correlations between the
presence and allele burden of JAK2 V617F and outcomes
in patients with MF.39-41,73-76 Studies in patients with
PMF have yielded conflicting results, ranging from no
prognostic effect of JAK2 V617F on survival41,73 to a clear
deleterious effect.74 In terms of allele burden, a low, rather
than high, JAK2 V617F allele burden appeared to confer a
more aggressive disease phenotype and inferior survival in
2 independent cohorts.41,75 However, in an Italian study
in patients with post-PV (43 patients) and post-ET (22
patients) MF, neither the JAK2 mutational status nor the
JAK2 V617F allele burden was found to influence disease
phenotype or prognosis.76
Prognostic relevance of MPL and CALR mutations

In a study of 603 patients with PMF, MPL mutations
(most commonly W515L/W515K) were detected in
8.1% of patients and rarely coexisted with a JAK2 V617F
mutation. The presence of mutant MPL had inconsistent
phenotypic effects and did not influence OS or LFS.65
CALR mutations have been reported in up to 88% of
patients with JAK2-negative and MPL-negative
PMF.66,67 Multiple studies in patients with PMF have
reported that patients with CALR mutations tend to be
younger and have higher platelet counts; superior survival;
and lower risks of developing anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and marked leukocytosis than those with other molecular
subtypes (JAK2-mutated, MPL-mutated, and “triple negative”).66,77,78 The favorable impact of CALR mutations
on survival appears to be independent of DIPSS-plus risk
category.78 In terms of both long-term survival and LT,
outcomes appear to be best for CALR-mutated patients
and worst for “triple-negative” patients.79 Among 617
subjects with PMF in a European study, the median survival times were 17.7 years, 9.2 years, 9.1 years, and 3.2
years, respectively, among CALR-mutated, JAK2686

mutated, MPL-mutated, and “triple-negative” patients,
and the impact of genetic lesions on survival was independent of current prognostic scoring systems.77
Although all CALR mutations generate a novel Cterminus with loss of the “KDEL” endoplasmic reticulum
retention motif and impaired calcium binding,66,67 the
much more common type 1 mutations (52-base pair deletions, which are significantly more frequent in PMF than
in ET) eliminate nearly all the negatively charged amino
acids, whereas type 2 mutations (5-base pair insertions)
retain approximately one-half of these.66 Preliminary evidence suggests significant differences in phenotype and
prognostic impact between type 1 and type 2 CALR mutations. In a study of 358 patients with PMF, survival was
found to be significantly longer in those with type 1
CALR mutations compared with those with either JAK2
or type 2 CALR mutations. In addition, patients with type
2 CALR mutations had significantly higher DIPSS-plus
scores, leukocyte counts, and circulating blasts than those
with type 1 CALR mutations.80
Other mutations

Numerous studies in recent years have uncovered several
recurrent somatic mutations in Ph- MPN genomes,66,67,81
which has generated enormous interest in using mutational
information to further refine the tools currently available
for prognostication, particularly in patients with PMF.82-84
These mutations often coexist with one another and with
the aforementioned “driver” mutations. In a study of 879
patients with PMF, mutations in the epigenetic regulators
EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2
subunit)85 and ASXL1 (additional sex combs-like 1, transcriptional regulator), the splicing gene SRSF2 (serine/
arginine-rich splicing factor 2),86 and the genes encoding
the Krebs cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and
2 (IDH1 and IDH2)87 were found to be prognostically
unfavorable for both survival and LT, but only ASXL1
mutations retained prognostic significance independent
of the IPSS and DIPSS-plus.82 Other studies have
reported CALR-/ASXL1 1 (median survival of 2.3 years
vs 10.4 years for CALR1/ASXL1- individuals) as a highrisk molecular signature in patients with PMF.78,84 Furthermore, the number of prognostically detrimental
mutations (0 vs 1 vs  2) has been found to be highly significant in terms of OS (median 12.3 years vs 7 years vs
2.6 years, respectively) as well as LFS.83 IDH mutations
have been reported to cluster with SRSF2 mutations86 in
patients with PMF and to potentially collaborate with
JAK2 V617F in leukemogenesis.87 Analysis of data from

ruxolitinib demonstrated that responses occurred at similar frequencies across different mutation profiles and
that ruxolitinib improved survival independent of the
mutation profile and reduced the risk of death in
patients harboring mutations in ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2,
or IDH1/2 versus best available therapy.88 A study of 95
patients treated on the initial phase 1/2 trial of ruxolitinib conducted in the United States found that patients
with 3 mutations were significantly less likely to have
an IWG-defined spleen response (50% reduction in
spleen size from baseline) and had a significantly shorter
time to treatment discontinuation and OS than those
with 2 mutations.89
MIPSS and GPSS

In light of the above observations, a mutation-enhanced
IPSS (MIPSS) for PMF was recently described.90 The
study included 986 patients with PMF who were divided
into learning (588 patients) and validation (398 patients)
cohorts. Four risk groups without overlap in their survival
curves were identified: low (score of 0-0.5), intermediate1 (score of 1-1.5), intermediate-2 (score of 2-3.5), and
high (score of  4) risk (Table 6).90,91 Because karyotype
carried MIPSS-independent prognostic value for both OS
and LFS in the validation cohort,90 an integrated
genetics-based prognostic scoring system (GPSS) that
takes into account only age and karyotypic and mutational information also was developed.91 This model was
used to delineate 4 risk categories: low (0 points),
intermediate-1 (1-2 points), intermediate-2 (3-4 points),
and high (5 points), with corresponding median OS
times of >17 years, 9 years, 5 years, and 2.2 years, respectively (Table 6).90,91 Furthermore, patients with higher
Cancer

March 1, 2016

(high/intermediate-2) and lower (low/intermediate-1)
risk were found to have vastly different median OS (5
years vs 26.4 years) and LFS (11.6 years vs not reached).91
Clinical Usefulness of Prognostic Scoring in MF
and the Pitfalls of Current Systems

The management of MF focuses on the amelioration of
anemia, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms and
the treatment of extramedullary hematopoiesis, with the
goals of therapy being prolongation of survival and cure,
which currently is achievable only with allo-HSCT.1
Consensus guidelines from the European LeukemiaNet/
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
recommend that all patients aged <70 years with PMF
with intermediate-2-risk or high-risk disease according to
the IPSS, DIPSS, or DIPSS-plus be considered for alloHSCT.92 Patients aged < 65 years with intermediate-1risk disease should be considered for allo-HSCT if they
present with refractory, transfusion-dependent anemia;
circulating blasts > 2%; or adverse cytogenetics (as
defined by the DIPSS-plus classification).92 Considering
that ruxolitinib is approved, at least in the United States,
for the same population (without age restriction), the precise timing of allo-HSCT in patients receiving ruxolitinib
and the use of ruxolitinib after transplantation represent
areas of considerable uncertainty. In addition, the guidelines recommend that patients with “triple-negative” intermediate-1-risk disease and those with mutated ASXL1
be considered for allo-HSCT, while acknowledging that
the molecular risk stratification of PMF requires further
validation. In contrast, low-risk patients and patients with
LT who are not in complete or partial remission from
their leukemia should not undergo allo-HSCT.92 Finally,
687

Review Article

several transplant-specific high-risk factors are recognized:
spleen size > 22 cm (as measured by ultrasound), > 20
RBC units transfused, a human leukocyte antigen nonidentical donor, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status >2, portal hypertension, and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity
Index > 3.92
The vast majority of prognostic classification studies
have focused on PMF, and although post-PV and postET MF are often perceived to be clinically and biologically similar,93 to the best of our knowledge, at least one
relatively large retrospective study has shown that the
IPSS fails to accurately delineate different risk categories
within this group of patients,25 suggesting that an alternative prognostication tool is needed. This is therapeutically
important, for example, because the US approval of ruxolitinib for patients with both PMF and post-ET/PV MF is
based on IPSS risk. Indeed, the European LeukemiaNet/
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
guidelines regarding allo-HSCT are specifically restricted
to patients with PMF in recognition of the differences in
biologic characteristics and applicability of prognostic
classification systems between patients with PMF and
those with post-ET/PV MF.92 However, efforts are being
made to address this issue. A recent analysis of 718
patients with post-ET/PV MF found significantly higher
Hgb levels and leukocyte counts and more frequent hepatosplenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and abnormal
karyotype among patients with post-PV MF, although
the rate of LT was significantly higher in patients with
post-ET MF.94 Survival and thrombosis incidence were
not significantly different.94 A new prognostic model, the
Myelofibrosis Secondary Prognostic Model (MYSECPM), was derived from this cohort.95 The variables that
retained a significant impact on survival on multivariable
analysis, along with their weightage based on the corresponding hazard ratios, were age >65 years (3 points),
time to development of post-ET/PV MF of > 15 years (2
points), history of thrombosis (2 points), constitutional
symptoms (2 points), Hgb < 10 g/dL (1 point), and circulating blasts 1% (2 points).95 Low-risk, intermediaterisk, and high-risk categories were defined by 0 to 2, 3 to
6, and >6 points, respectively, and the corresponding median survival times were not reached, 7.9 years, and 3.8
years, respectively.95 Results from the pilot phase of a
large, multinational, European registry study (1209
patients) also were recently presented.96 In this study,
Hgb levels and leukocyte counts also were significantly
higher among patients with post-PV MF compared with
those with PMF or post-ET MF, and there were higher
688

percentages of patients with constitutional symptoms and
splenomegaly in the post-PV MF cohort, but survival and
rates of LT did not differ significantly.96 In addition, this
retrospective study did confirm the prognostic significance of the IPSS among patients with PMF (61%), postET MF (20%), and post-PV MF (19%).96
Similarly, patients with early/prefibrotic PMF were
excluded from the cohorts based on which the existing
prognostic systems for PMF were derived; nevertheless, this
entity is currently classified under PMF by the WHO. It
has been estimated that between 40% and 50% of patients
with PMF present with early/prefibrotic PMF.97 However,
because early/prefibrotic PMF remains a difficult diagnosis
to make,98 such estimates must be interpreted with great
caution. Because the statistical methods used to identify a
variable as being significantly associated with prognosis are
sensitive to the prevalence of the variable in the study population, this does raise the question of whether the current
tools for prognostication (ie, IPSS/DIPSS/DIPSS-plus)
remain equally applicable to the “real” PMF population.
Because, to our knowledge, this has yet to be documented,
an intriguing question is whether systems that are less reliant on clinical variables (eg, GPSS) could be more relevant.
Conversely, the idea that the percentage of cases of PMF
that are early/prefibrotic is that high and therefore could
significantly impact the composition of the “real” PMF
population and alter the validity of current prognostic
models is purely speculative.
Although having a prognostic scoring system that
works at any time point in a patient’s disease course rather
than only at the time of diagnosis is of great clinical usefulness (eg, revised IPSS99 vs IPSS100 in the myelodysplastic
syndromes), the effect of therapy is an inherent confounding factor. The DIPSS for PMF was developed through
application of the IPSS risk factors at later time points to
determine whether they remained statistically significant
predictors of survival, rather than an independent effort to
identify factors that would remain prognostic after diagnosis. In the aforementioned Spanish study in patients
with post-ET/PV MF,25 the authors concluded that the
prognostic impact of leukocytosis was lost because
patients were typically receiving cytoreductive therapy at
the time of progression to MF. However, the issue of
prognostic variables being influenced by therapy and
potentially altering risk stratification is unlikely to have
been a major one in the era preceding the approval of ruxolitinib when the DIPSS was developed, given the absence
of any disease-modifying therapies at the time, although it
could certainly be much more significant in the present
Cancer

Prognostication in Myelofibrosis/Bose and Verstovsek

JAK inhibitor era101 and potentially more so in the future
as other disease-altering therapies102,103 are developed.
Because PMF is a disease of older individuals, the
issue of death from other causes is a pertinent one. The
IPSS, DIPSS, and DIPSS-plus all consider age >65 years
as a poor prognostic factor, and this threshold is lowered
to 60 years in the MIPSS and GPSS. However, to the best
of our knowledge, no evidence exists to support these age
cutoffs for the determination of risk of death if only PMFrelated deaths, rather than all-cause mortality, were considered. Whether doing so would change the age thresholds is, therefore, unknown. However, from a practical
standpoint, all-cause mortality is most likely more relevant, and ascertaining whether a death is related to PMF is
fraught with difficulty due to the inherent heterogeneity
of the disease and the potential involvement of multiple
organs/organ systems.
Although the prevailing enthusiasm for the use of
molecular factors in prognostic models and even relying
only on age and genomic information for prognostication
(eg, GPSS) is understandable, a few caveats deserve mention. Genetic information greatly enhances our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the biology of LT.
However, molecular testing is not universally available,
and mutational and karyotypic information might not be
obtainable in some situations (eg, “dry tap”). Furthermore, genomic information cannot be obtained at each
visit (less “dynamic” than IPSS/DIPSS variables), potentially leading to a failure to capture clonal evolution.
Finally, the greatest prognostic value of molecular information might be in reclassifying patients at lower risk
(low/intermediate-1) rather than patients who are already
in higher-risk categories by conventional scoring systems.77 Of course, molecular markers could be of
immense use in the post-allo-HSCT setting for the detection of minimal residual disease, and potentially provide
novel targets (eg, IDH inhibitors)104 for therapy.
Conclusions

Prognostic factors and risk stratification systems in MF
have evolved significantly over the years, from being based
purely on blood counts to complex scoring systems that
integrate clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic, and molecular information. It is evident from the preceding discussion that
despite the evolution of multiple, validated prognostic
models for PMF, there remains room for improvement.
The advent of the MIPSS, which integrates clinical variables and molecular information, is certainly a welcome development, as well as the GPSS, which eliminates most
clinical variables, although these also have their pitfalls, as
Cancer

discussed above. In the coming months and years, these
new models are likely to be published in full and independently validated before their incorporation into routine practice, which will require the widespread availability of
genomic testing. In addition, with further elucidation of
the genomic landscape of PMF (including early/prefibrotic
MF) and post-ET/PV MF, especially in this era of diseasemodifying therapies101 with multiple novel agents with
unique mechanisms of action102,103 and JAK inhibitorbased combinations105 currently in development, further
refinements to these models are anticipated.
