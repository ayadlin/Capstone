ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy has an important role in the treatment of breast cancer.
Dysfunction p53 and hypoxia are typical biological characteristics of breast cancer
that constitute barriers to the efficacy of radiotherapy. Mitophagy plays a protective
role in cellular homeostasis under hypoxic conditions, while mitophagy is inhibited by
p53 in normal cells. We explored the effects of a p53 fusion protein, TAT-ODD-p53,
on the radiosensitivity of hypoxic breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, as
well as investigating the related molecular mechanisms. We found that selective
accumulation of TAT-ODD-p53 occurred under hypoxic conditions and signif icantly
increased tumor cell radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Mitophagy had an
important role in maintaining hypoxia-induced radioresistance. Mitophagy was
inhibited by TAT-ODD-p53 and this inhibition was suppressed by over-expression of
Parkin in hypoxic irradiated breast cancer cells. In addition, mitophagy was induced
by deletion of p53, with this effect being weakened by Parkin knockdown at a low
oxygen tension. By interacting with Parkin, p53 inhibited the translocation of Parkin to
the mitochondria, disrupting the protective mitophagy process. These results suggest
that TAT-ODD-p53 has a signif icant and preferential radiosensitizing effect on hypoxic
breast cancer cells by inhibition of Parkin-mediated mitophagy.

of p53 function [6]. In some tumor cell lines, hypoxia
may decrease radiosensitivity by suppression of p53
activity [7], while reactivation of p53 seems to be an
effective method of targeting hypoxic tumors [8]. Because
hypoxic regions are uncommon in normal tissues, synthetic
p53 peptides specifically targeting hypoxic cancer cells
could provide a novel approach to radiosensitization.
Mitophagy is a type of autophagy that occurs in the
mitochondria, and it plays a critical role in the selective
removal of damaged or unwanted mitochondria to avoid
cell death [9].The protein Parkin is selectively recruited
to dysfunctional mitochondria with a low membrane
potential, where it subsequently mediates the degradation
of impaired mitochondria by autophagosomes [10]. It has
been found that Parkin-mediated mitophagy is also induced
by hypoxia, and helps to restore cellular homeostasis by

INTRODUCTION
Among cancers affecting in women, breast cancer
has the highest incidence and causes the second highest
mortality [1]. Current treatment for breast cancer often
involves radiation therapy, which is widely used and
effective. However, hypoxic tumor cells usually exhibit
radioresistance, which poses a challenge for successful
radiation therapy [2]. Hypoxic regions are found in most
solid tumors, but seldom occur in normal tissues [3, 4].
Therefore, hypoxic cells are an attractive tumor-specific
target for improving the response to ionizing radiation.
It has been reported that tumor cells expressing
wild-type p53 are more sensitive to radiation than p53
knockout cells in the presence of hypoxia [5], suggesting
that a hypoxic environment may select for cells with loss

degrading defective mitochondria [11]. Since autophagy
has been reported to be involved in tumor resistance to
radiotherapy [12], we hypothesized that Parkin-mediated
mitophagy might contribute to hypoxic radioresistance.
While p53 regulates autophagy as a nuclear
transcription factor [13], it also inhibits the process
of autophagy by a poorly characterized extranuclear
mechanism [14]. Moreover, there is increasing evidence
that p53 inhibits mitophagy in normal cells [15, 16].
Consistent with such findings, it has been reported that
cytosolic p53 can also disturb the process of mitophagy
by inhibiting Parkin in mouse heart cells and pancreatic
β-cells [17, 18]. Despite these recent reports about
regulation of mitophagy by p53 in normal cells, the role of
p53 in tumor cell mitophagy remains poorly understood.
We previously constructed a novel fusion
protein consisting of wild-type p53 combined with
TAT domain47–57 and the minimum oxygen-dependent
degradation domain557–574 (ODD) of hypoxia-induced
factor-1 α (HIF-1α). We found that TAT-ODD-p53
(TOP) was successfully delivered into cells via the TAT
protein transduction domain and selectively stabilized
in hypoxic tumor tissues under regulation of the ODD
domain [19, 20]. In this study, we evaluated the use of
TAT-ODD-p53 for targeted radiosensitization both in vitro
and in vivo and investigated the underlying mechanisms.

Our findings suggested that TAT-ODD-p53 has a significant
radiosensitizing effect on hypoxic breast cancer cells that
is due to inhibition of Parkin-mediated mitophagy.

RESULTS
Transmembrane delivery, location, and stability
of synthetic p53 peptides
To assess intracellular delivery of the synthetic p53
peptides, MDA-MB-157 cells (null p53) were treated with
PBS or p53 peptides at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml
for 1 h under normoxic (20% O2) or hypoxic (0.5% O2)
conditions. Western blotting showed that expression of p53
was only detectable in cells treated with the TAT-p53 or
TAT-ODD-p53 fusion proteins, suggesting that p53 fusion
proteins conjugated with TAT could be effectively delivered
intracellularly in vitro. Importantly, p53 was delivered stably
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions when the cells
were treated with TAT-p53. In contrast, p53 was rapidly
degraded under normoxic conditions when cells were treated
with TAT-ODD-p53, but it remained stable under hypoxic
conditions (Figure  1A). These results demonstrated that
TAT-ODD-p53 penetrated the cells sufficiently and was
selectively stable under hypoxic conditions.

Radiosensitization of breast cancer cells by
synthetic p53 peptides in vitro

To assess whether TAT-ODD-p53 showed selective
accumulation in the hypoxic regions of breast tumors
in vivo, we used immunofluorescence staining to analyze
the co-localization of TAT-ODD-p53 and pimonidazole,
which is a probe that selectively stains hypoxic tissue.
We  found that TAT-ODD-p53 was localized with
pimonidazole in similar areas of tumor tissue, indicating
that TAT-ODD-p53 showed preferential accumulation
and remained stable in the hypoxic regions of tumor
tissue (Figure 1B).

To choose a suitable dosage for further investigation,
we analyzed the inhibition of cell growth by p53 fusion
proteins in different O2 environments. Breast cancer cells
were incubated with various concentrations of p53 fusion
proteins (0–32 μg/ml) for 72 h under hypoxic (0.5% O2)
or normoxic (20% O2) conditions and cell viability was
assessed with the MTT assay (Figure 2A).TAT-ODD-p53

only induced signif icant reduction of cell viability under
low oxygen conditions, suggesting that TAT-ODD-p53
could selectively inhibit tumor cell growth in hypoxic
regions. The IC50 value [21] of TAT-ODD-p53 for breast
cancer cells under low oxygen conditions was calculated
to be 4.00 μg/ml and 12.85 μg/ml for MDA-MB-157 cells
(null p53) and MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), respectively.
Subsequent experiments were carried out using a
concentration of 4 μg/ml and these two cell lines.
To determine the radio-sensitizing effect of TATODD-p53, a colony-forming assay was performed using
MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB- 157 cells exposed to radiation
after incubation for 1 h with TAT-ODD-p53 under
normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The radioprotective effect
of hypoxia can be expressed quantitatively by calculating
the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) [22]. The OER of
MCF-7cells and MDA-MB-157 cells was 1.91 and 2.43,
respectively, suggesting that hypoxia induced signif icant
radioresistance. The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER)
was calculated as the radiation dose that resulted in a
surviving fraction of 37% (D0 in radiobiology) divided
by the dose needed for the same surviving fraction when
cells were exposed to TAT-ODD-p53 plus radiation.TATODD-p53 sensitized MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-157 cells
to ionizing radiation, with SERs of up to 1.55 and 2.24,
respectively (Figure 2B).
Apoptosis was measured by f low cytometry (FCM)
and western blotting in MDA-MB-157 cells treated with
TAT-ODD-p53 (4 μg/ml) under hypoxic conditions at 48 h
after irradiation (6 Gy). As shown in Figure 2C and 2D,
radiation-induced apoptosis increased notably under
hypoxic conditions after exposure to TAT-ODD-p53. There
was a consistent and signif icant increase of caspase-3
cleavage in the combination group under hypoxic
conditions (Figure 2E). Taken together, these results
provided further evidence that TAT-ODD-p53 enhanced
the radiosensitivity of hypoxic breast cancer cells.

radiosensitivity of MDA-MB-157 xenografts established
in nude mice, demonstrating that the ­TAT-ODD domain
had no antitumor activity (Figure 3A, 3B).
DNA fragmentation was detected by the TdTmediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and
DAPI was used as a nuclear marker. It was found that
TAT-ODD-p53 signif icantly increased the number of
apoptotic nuclei with fragmented DNA in tumor tissues
at seven days after irradiation (Figure 3C, 3D). Consistent
with previous data, the TUNEL assay showed a signif icant
increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the combined
treatment group compared with the TAT-ODD-p53 alone
or irradiation alone groups.

TAT-ODD-p53 may sensitize hypoxic cells to
irradiation by inhibition of mitophagy
Clearance of defective mitochondria by an
autophagic process is termed mitophagy and is essential for
mitochondrial homeostasis. Co-localization of LC3 (GFPLC3; green f luorescence), a marker of autophagosomes
[23] and mitochondria (MitoTracker; red f luorescence)
was evaluated for detection of mitophagy. Quantification
of co-localization showed that more mitochondria and
autophagosomes were co-localized in hypoxic cells
with or without irradiation, suggesting that mitophagy
was induced under low oxygen conditions (Figure 4A).
Electron microscopy revealed that mitochondria were
incorporated into autophagic vacuoles in the hypoxic cells
(Figure 4B), providing further evidence that mitophagy
was induced in breast cancer cells by hypoxia.
In addition, real-time PCR was employed to
determine the expression of mt-Atp6 (mitochondrial
DNA; mtDNA) and Rpl13 (genomic DNA), since the
ratio reflects the relative number of mitochondria per cell
[24]. It was found that the mtDNA content decreased in
irradiated cells exposed to hypoxia, while this change
was reversed by Atg7 knockdown [23] (Figure 4C, 4D),
suggesting that mitophagy participated in mitochondrial
clearance under hypoxic conditions. Immunof luorescence
of hypoxic irradiated MDA-MB-157 cells demonstrated a
decrease of co-localization between LC3 and mitochondria
(Figure 4E), while the number of mitochondria was
increased in TOP group (Figure 4F). Mitophagy was also
enhanced in hypoxic irradiated MCF7 cells (wild-type
p53) after transfection with siRNA for p53 (Figure 4G),
while the number of mitochondria decreased after p53
knockdown (Figure 4H). These results suggested that TATODD-p53 inhibited hypoxia-induced mitophagy in breast
cancer cells.
To further clarify whether an effect on mitophagy
was involved in radio-sensitization of hypoxic cells by
TAT-ODD-p53, we employed the colony-forming assay
to evaluate the radiosensitivity of hypoxic MDA-MB-157
cells treated with TAT-ODD-p53 and/or Atg7 siRNA [24].
Hypoxic cells were more sensitive to radiation when

Radiosensitization of breast cancer cells by
synthetic p53 peptides in vivo
The in vivo effects of TAT-ODD-p53 were
evaluated in combination with local tumor irradiation.
Nude mice with subcutaneous MDA-MB-157 xenograft
tumors were treated with TAT-ODD-p53 (1 mg/kg, i.p.)
every day for five days before a single 10 Gy dose of
radiation and tumor growth was monitored until the
maximum permitted volume (600 mm3) was reached. In
unirradiated mice treated with PBS or TAT-ODD-p53,
the tumors reached this volume on day 14 and 18,
respectively. However, the time to reach the maximum
permitted volume was 21 days in mice receiving
radiation alone and 32 days in mice treated by radiation
combined with TAT-ODD-p53, demonstrating distinct
supra-additive tumor growth delay. In contrast, TATODD-EGFP did not inhibit the growth or enhance the

200 mm3, the mice were treated with PBS (Con), TAT-ODD-EGFP (TOE), or TOP for 5 days and received 10 Gy of radiation on day
5 (mean ± SD, n = 5). B. Pretreatment with TOP resulted in supra-additive tumor growth delay. Columns show the mean time for the

mitophagy was inhibited by Atg7 knockdown, with an SER
of 1.92 (Figure 4I). The radiosensitizing effect of TATODD-p53 was attenuated after autophagy was blocked
by Atg7 knockdown, since the SER of TAT-ODD-p53 for
hypoxic cells transfected with Atg7 (1.27) was lower than
that for the control group (2.26) (Figure 4I), suggesting
TAT-ODD-p53 increases the sensitivity of hypoxic cells to
irradiation at least partly through inhibition of mitophagy.

Overexpression of Parkin partly reversed the
inhibitory effect of TAT-ODD-p53 on mitophagy in
MDA-MB-157 cells (Figure 5D, 5E), and the number of
mitochondria was also increased in the combination group
compared with the TOP group (Figure 5F). In addition,
p53 knockdown-mediated induction of co-localization
between LC3 and mitochondria in MCF7 cells under
hypoxic conditions was eliminated by deletion of Parkin
(Figure 5G, 5H), and the number of mitochondria was no
longer decreased by p53 knockdown after inhibition of
Parkin (Figure 5I).These results demonstrated that TATODD-p53 blocked mitophagy via the Parkin-dependent
pathway under hypoxic conditions.
To further confirm the mechanism by which p53
acted on Parkin-mediated mitophagy, expression of
Parkin was tested by qRT-PCR and western blotting
(Figure 6A, 6B). P53 did not alter Parkin expression in
hypoxic breast cancer cells, but it affected translocation
of Parkin to the mitochondria. In MDA-MB-157
cells, mitochondrial translocation of Parkin was
inhibited by TAT-ODD-p53. Since translocation was
increased by p53 knockdown in MCF7 cells, TATODD itself did not regulate the translocation of Parkin.

TAT-ODD-p53 inhibits mitophagy in hypoxic
cells by suppressing translocation of Parkin to
the mitochondria
Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that selectively
undergoes translocation into damaged mitochondria to
initiate mitophagy [25]. In irradiated MDA-MB-157 cells,
we found that hypoxia-induced mitophagy was inhibited
by Parkin knockdown (Figure 5A, 5B). The mtDNA
content was elevated in hypoxic cells with depletion
of Parkin, suggesting that clearance of mitochondria
by mitophagy was reduced (Figure 5C). These results
indicated that mitophagy might occur via the Parkindependent pathway under hypoxic conditions.

Because transcription-independent modulation of
autophagy by cytoplasmic p53 has often been reported
[14] and Parkin undergoes selective translocation to
impaired mitochondria to initiate mitophagy [9], the
interaction between p53 and Parkin proteins was examined
in the cytosolic lysate of MDA-MB-157 cells. After
treatment with TAT-ODD-p53, the Parkin-p53 complex
was observed in immunoprecipitates of both Parkin and
p53 under hypoxic conditions (Figure 6C). An interaction
between endogenous p53 and Parkin proteins was also
found in hypoxic MCF7 cells (Figure 6D). These results
suggest that p53 may interact with Parkin in the cytoplasm
and disturb its translocation to the mitochondria, thereby
blocking the process of mitophagy.
Re-expression of Parkin in TAT-ODD-p53 treated
MDA-MB-157 cells restored radioresistance under
hypoxic conditions. Moreover, inhibition of mitophagy
by ATG7 knockdown reversed Parkin -induced

radioresistance in TAT-ODD-p53 treated MDA-MB-157
cells under hypoxic conditions (Figure 6E). These
results suggested that TAT-ODD-p53 regulates tumor
cell radiosensitivity at least partly by inhibiting Parkinmediated mitophagy.

DISCUSSION
Resistance of many solid tumors to anticancer
therapies is an important clinical problem and is partly
determined by hypoxia of the tumor microenvironment.
Previous studies have demonstrated that hypoxic cells in
the tumor mass play a vital role in radioresistance, which
means that killing hypoxic tumor cells is important in
the treatment of solid tumors. The tumor suppressor p53
shows mutation or silencing in many tumor cells. After
loss of p53 function, cancer cells escape from commitment
to apoptosis and continue through the cell cycle without
17424

being arrested at cell cycle checkpoints [27]. The result of
these alterations is generation of radioresistant tumor cells.
We previously constructed a p53 peptide fused with TATODD, which was proven to function efficiently in hypoxic
cells and in solid tumors (colorectal adenocarcinoma and
non-small lung cancer) [19, 20]. In the present study,
we demonstrated that this TAT-ODD-P53 fusion protein
was taken up by hypoxic breast cancer cells and was
selectively stable in these cells. Moreover, treatment with
TAT-ODD-P53 signif icantly enhanced the radiosensitivity
of hypoxic breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Mitophagy plays a key role in the removal of
damaged mitochondria [28], and is an adaptive response
that is reported to be induced by hypoxia and photoirradiation [10, 29]. However, the role of mitophagy
in radioresistance of hypoxic breast cancer cells has
been unclear. Our present results demonstrated that
mitophagy was markedly increased by hypoxia, leading
to radioresistance of breast cancer cells. Parkin is an
E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been reported to initiate
mitophagy, which eliminated dysfunctional mitochondria
and contributed to stress adaptation in a chemical
hypoxia model. This study demonstrated that induction of
mitophagy by hypoxia could be inhibited by the deletion
of Parkin, suggesting the involvement of Parkin-mediated
mitophagy in radioresistance of breast cancer cells under
hypoxic conditions.
It is known that p53 not only regulates apoptosis,
but also autophagy. It was reported that p53 promotes
mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting Parkin-mediated
mitophagy in mouse heart cells and pancreatic β-cells
[17, 18]. However, there have been few studies on the
role of p53 in cancer cell mitophagy. In the present study,
we focused on the role of p53 in regulating mitophagy.
Overexpression of exogenous p53 was demonstrated
to repress the induction of mitophagy in irradiated
hypoxic breast cancer cells, and this effect was reversed
by overexpression of Parkin, while suppression of
endogenous p53 had the opposite effect. However, p53
knockdown did not enhance mitophagy in Parkin-depleted
hypoxic breast cancer cells .These results indicate that
Parkin is required for the regulation of mitophagy by
p53 in hypoxic breast cancer cells. Moreover, the radiosensitizing effect of synthetic p53 peptides on hypoxic
cells was weaker after autophagy was blocked by ATG7.
In addition, overexpression of Parkin only reduced the
radio-sensitizing effect of TAT-ODD-P53 in hypoxic cells
not transfected with ATG7 siRNA. All of these findings
support the hypothesis that p53 sensitizes hypoxic cancer
cells to radiation by inhibiting Parkin-mediated mitophagy.
Parkin has been identified as a target gene of p53
and was reported to be a repressor of p53 transcription in
neurons [30, 31]. However, this study revealed that p53
did not alter Parkin expression in hypoxic breast cancer
cells, but instead affected translocation of Parkin to the
mitochondria. While the role of p53 as a transcription
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factor in the activation of numerous genes has been
studied extensively and new target genes are regularly
reported, p53 also operates in the cytosol to modulate
cell death and autophagy in a transcription-independent
manner [14, 32]. This was also seen in the present study
with regard to regulation of Parkin by p53. The Parkin-p53
complex was observed by immunoprecipitation of
both Parkin and p53 (exogenous or endogenous) in the
cytosolic lysate of hypoxic breast cancer cells, proving
that a direct interaction occurred between these two
proteins under hypoxic conditions. These results also
support the previous report that p53 can either induce
or inhibit autophagy in response to stress depending on
its subcellular localization, and that cytoplasmic p53
suppresses the induction of autophagy [14].
In conclusion, TAT-ODD-p53 demonstrated a
signif icant radiosensitizing effect on hypoxic solid tumor
cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it has the
potential to improve the therapeutic index of radiation
therapy. Parkin-mediated mitophagy may contribute
to the hypoxic radioresistance of breast cancer cells,
and is regulated by a direct interaction between p53
and Parkin. Demonstration of a direct molecular link
between activation of p53 and suppression of Parkinmediated mitophagy has established a new mechanism of
radiosensitization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (wildtype p53) was obtained from the Cell Bank of Type
Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China). The MDA-MB-157 cell line (null p53)
was obtained from the Cell Resource Center of Peking
Union (Beijing, China). MCF-7 cells were maintained in
DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco).
MDA-MB-157 cells were maintained in DMEM (Gibco)
containing 10% FBS (Gibco), 1 mM glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, and 1% non-essential amino acids. All
of the cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO2 in air.

Peptide synthesis
Expression plasmids for TAT-ODD-p53, TAT-p53,
TAT-ODD-EGFP, and p53 were constructed. Protein
expression and purification were carried out as described
previously [19]. All of the proteins were stored in 50 mM
PBS at –80°C and were used within six months.

Hypoxia and irradiation
Cells were subjected to hypoxia in a Forma 1029
anaerobic chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham,
MA, USA) with a humidified atmosphere of 0.5% O2 and
17425

5% CO2 balanced with N2 at 37°C. The cells were cultured
under hypoxic conditions for 8 h before either being treated
with synthetic p53 peptides or irradiated. Irradiation was
done at a dose rate of 5.0 Gy/min using a 6-MV linear
accelerator (LINAC; 2300EX; Varian Co., Palo Alto, CA,
USA) at a distance of 100 cm from the source to the axis.

followed by real-time PCR using an ABI 7500
Sequence Detection System with a SYBR® Premix
Ex Taq™ kit (Takara). The sequences of the specific
PCR primers were as follows: Parkin: Forward:
5′- GAGTCCAGGAGCTTGACACGAGT -3′, Reverse:
5′-AAGGGATGCTGCGCCTGTTGC -3′; p21: Forward:
5′-ATGTCCAATCCTGGTGATGT
-3′,
Reverse:
5′-TGCAGCAGGGCAGAGGAAGT-3′;β-actin:
Forward: 5′-TCGACAACGGCTCCGGCAT-3′ Reverse:
5′-AAGGTGTGGTGCCAGATTTTC-3′. β-actin was used
as the internal control.

Plasmids and RNA interference
p53 siRNA, Parkin siRNA, ATG7 siRNA and the
plasmid encoding Parkin were obtained from Genepharma
(Shanghai, China). Transfection was performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
instructions provided by the manufacturer.

mtDNA assay
Total cellular DNA was extracted with a Universal
Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Takara) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then real-time-PCR
was performed using the PrimeScript ® RT reagent kit
(TaKaRa) and an ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System.
The sequences of the primers were as follows: mt-ATP6
Forward: 5′- CGCCACCCTAGCAATATCAA-3′, Reverse:
5′-TTAAGGCGACAGCGATTTCT-3′; Rpl13: Forward:
5′-CTCGAGTCATCACTGAGGAA-3′,
Reverse:
5′-CAACATCCTGTTCTGCGGCTT-3′. The level of
gene expression was normalized by a standard curve and
relative expression was calculated as mt-Atp6/Rpl13.

Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of synthetic p53 peptides for
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-157 cells was studied to determine
the concentrations for use in subsequent studies. Cells
were plated into 96-well plates in 0.1 mL of medium
and incubated overnight. On the following day, the cells
were exposed to p53 peptide dissolved in PBS (0, 2, 4, 8,
16, or  32 μg/ml) for 72 h under normoxic or hypoxic
conditions. Then 20 ml of 5 mg/mL MTT solution in PBS
was added to each well for 4 h at 37°C. Subsequently,
20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution in 0.01% HCl
(150 μL) was added to each well, before measurement at
an absorbance of 570 nm using a spectrophotometric plate
reader (ND-1000, Wilmington, DE). Two independent
experiments were performed, with each being done
in triplicate. The inhibitory concentration (IC) was
determined for each peptide with each cell line.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were harvested and western blotting
was conducted as described previously [34]. Mitochondrial
and cytosolic fractions were isolated using a Qproteome™
Mitochondria Isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies included
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam), anti-p53 (Cell
Signaling), anti-Parkin (Cell Signaling), anti-ATG7 (Cell
Signaling) anti- COX IV, and anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling).
Blots were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Millipore).
Densitometric quantification of signal intensities was done
with Image Pro Plus 6.0 software.

Colony-forming assay
The colony-forming assay was performed to
determine radiosensitivity. Cells were plated in 6-well
plates and allowed to adhere overnight before exposure
to radiation at the indicated doses and a dose rate of
5 Gy/min using 6-MV X-rays generated by a linear
accelerator (Varian 2300EX, Varian, Palo Alto, CA).
After incubation for 10–14 days, the cells were stained
with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol. Then the colonies
(clusters of > 50 cells) were counted under a microscope.
Survival data from different experiments were pooled,
after which survival curves were fitted and analyzed by
using the linear-quadratic model (LQ). The sensitizing
enhancement ratio (SER) and oxygen enhancement ration
(OER) were calculated as described previously [22, 33].

Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
FITC-conjugated annexin V was used to detect
apoptosis. Cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and grown
to 80% confluence. After irradiation, the cells were
incubated for 24 h, followed by harvesting and staining
with annexin V-FITC and PI (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Then fluorescence was
detected by flow cytometry.

Quantitative RT-PCR

Tumor model

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Then reverse transcription was performed
with the PrimeScript® RT reagent kit (Takara),

For the in vivo experiments, 1 × 107 MDA-MB-157
cells were subcutaneously injected into the breasts of
6  to 8-week-old female Balb/c immunodeficient mice,
as described previously [34]. To assess the distribution

of p53 fusion protein and its stability in tumor tissues,
each p53 fusion protein (1 mg/kg) or PBS was injected
i.p. daily for five days into adult mice with established
tumors approximately 200 mm3 in size (n = 3 per group).
To visualize viable hypoxic cells, animals were injected
with pimonidazole (60 mg/kg I.P. (hypoxyprobe-1, USA)
at 60 min prior to being killed. Animal handling and
these experiments were performed in accordance with the
animal care guidelines of the Southern Medical University
(Guangzhou, China).

under a fluorescence confocal microscope (Olympus
FV10i) for confocal imaging using Olympus FV10-ASW
software.

Transmission electron microscopy
A total of 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes
overnight and then were cultured under hypoxic (0.5% O2)
conditions for 8 h. After irradiation (6 Gy), the cells were
cultured for 6 h before harvesting, and were kept overnight
in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) before being cut into 50-μm sections
on a vibratome. Selected areas were processed by postfixing in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, followed by
dehydration in a graded ethanol series and embedding
in epoxy resin. Polymerization was performed for 24 h
at 80°C. Ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut, stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed under an
AMTTEM camera system (Hitachi-H7500).

Assessment of tumor growth inhibition
Inhibition of tumor growth was studied in mice with
tumors approximately 200 mm3 in size by injecting animals
i.p. for five days with each p53 fusion protein (1 mg/kg) or
PBS (n = 5 per group). A single dose of radiation (10 Gy)
was given on day 5. Tumor dimensions were measured
with calipers and the volume was calculated by using the
formula V = (a × b2)/2, in which a and b are the largest and
smallest perpendicular diameters, respectively. Time zero
was the same for all four treatment conditions.

Co-Immunoprecipitation assay
Proteins were extracted from the cytoplasmic
fraction using a PARIS kit (Ambion) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation
was performed using the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation
Kit (26149, Pierce; Rockford, IL) by following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The lysates were applied
to columns containing 10 μg of immobilized antibodies
(p53 or Parkin) covalently linked to an amine-active
resin and incubated overnight at 4°C. Then the coimmunoprecipitate was eluted and analyzed by SDSPAGE along with the controls.

TUNEL assay for apoptosis
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase UTP nick
end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed on frozen
tumor tissue sections at seven days after exposure, using
an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics,
12156792910, Branford, CT, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After washing 3 times
for 5 min each in PBS, the sections were mounted in
fluorescence mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen)
to identify the nuclei.
All of the paired sections were examined under a
fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).

Statistics
Unless stated otherwise, all of the experiments were
conducted in triplicate. Data were analyzed for statistical
significance by using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA.
Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation,
and a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

Preparation of stable GFP-LC3-expressing cells
A recombinant lentivirus containing GFP-LC3
was obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China).
MDA-MB-157 cells and MCF7 cells were infected with
lentivirus particles and isolated by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting to obtain t cells that stably expressed GFP-LC3.
