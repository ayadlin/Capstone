Abstract
Melanoma growth is driven by malignant melanoma-initiating cells (MMIC) identified by expression of the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) member ABCB5. ABCB5þ melanoma subpopulations have been shown to overexpress the vasculogenic differentiation markers CD144 (VE-cadherin) and TIE1 and are associated with CD31
vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an established biomarker associated with increased patient mortality. Here we
identify a critical role for VEGFR-1 signaling in ABCB5þ MMIC-dependent VM and tumor growth. Global gene
expression analyses, validated by mRNA and protein determinations, revealed preferential expression of VEGFR1 on ABCB5þ tumor cells purified from clinical melanomas and established melanoma lines. In vitro, VEGF
induced the expression of CD144 in ABCB5þ subpopulations that constitutively expressed VEGFR-1 but not in
ABCB5 bulk populations that were predominantly VEGFR-1. In vivo, melanoma-specific shRNA-mediated
knockdown of VEGFR-1 blocked the development of ABCB5þ VM morphology and inhibited ABCB5þ VMassociated production of the secreted melanoma mitogen laminin. Moreover, melanoma-specific VEGFR-1
knockdown markedly inhibited tumor growth (by >90%). Our results show that VEGFR-1 function in MMIC
regulates VM and associated laminin production and show that this function represents one mechanism
through which MMICs promote tumor growth. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1474–85. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Human malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive and
drug-resistant cancer that is usually refractory to systemic
therapy. Identification of undifferentiated subpopulations
with embryonic-like plasticity within this malignancy has
pointed to the existence of aggressive cell subsets that may
be responsible for melanoma initiation, tumor progression,
and resistance to chemotherapy (1–4). Recently our laboratory
identified tumorigenic malignant melanoma-initiating cells
(MMIC) capable of self-renewal and differentiation that can be

prospectively enriched on the basis of preferential expression
of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) member ABCB5 (5–8), a
chemoresistance gene (5, 9, 10). ABCB5þ tumor cells, which
were found to range in frequency from 1.6% to 20.4% in human
melanomas (7), correlate with malignant disease initiation
and metastatic progression in tumor xenotransplantation
models involving either NOD/SCID or NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) g-chain null (NSG) murine recipients
(7, 11, 12) and in clinical studies of human melanoma patients
(7, 13–15) according to results from several laboratories.
Consistent with these findings, the ABCB5 gene is also preferentially expressed by in vitro self-renewing, clonogenic
melanoma subpopulations (16), melanoma cell lines of metastatic as opposed to primary tumor origin (17), and melanomas with high in vivo tumorigenic capacity in human to
murine xenotransplantation models (18, 19). Furthermore,
ABCB5 is downregulated in human melanoma cells upon
induction of terminal differentiation (20). Importantly,
ABCB5þ melanoma cells can be therapeutically targeted in
experimental tumor xenotransplantation models, with specific killing of this tumor subpopulation resulting in inhibition
of tumor growth (7).
MMIC-enriched ABCB5þ melanoma subpopulations trigger
tumorigenesis and promote neoplastic progression through
enhanced self-renewal and proliferative capacity (7). Preferential evasion of host antitumor immunity, a determinant of
tumor growth (4, 21–25), represents an additional mechanism

responsible for the enhanced tumorigenicity of ABCB5þ melanoma subpopulations (8). Tumor functions relevant to the
generation of a protumorigenic microenvironment through
differentiation (4, 26) could represent additional mechanisms
for the preferential tumorigenicity of ABCB5þ melanoma
subpopulations. In this regard, we recently found that ABCB5þ
human melanoma cells are specifically associated with vasculogenic mimicry (VM), a phenomenon whereby more primitive and aggressive melanoma cells express endothelial
genes and related proteins [TIE1 and CD144 (VE-cadherin),
but not CD31] and in situ develop patterned networks composed of periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and laminin-reactive
basement membranes lined by tumor cells (27). Our previous
results showed that subpopulations of ABCB5þ human melanoma cells preferentially express the vasculogenic differentiation markers TIE1 and CD144 (7). Expression of TIE1 and
CD144 by ABCB5þ melanoma subpopulations was confirmed
by gene and protein expression analyses of genetically tracked
fluorescent melanoma xenografts (7). Furthermore, human
tumor cells that coexpressed ABCB5 and TIE1/CD144 were
distinct from mature CD31þ tumor endothelium in clinical
patient tumors and experimental melanomas in serial xenotransplantation experiments (7). Although it remains currently
unknown whether VM might represent, in addition to conventional angiogenesis, a related yet independent mechanism of
tumor perfusion, it has been established that VM characterized
by expression of TIE1 and CD144 relates to melanoma aggressiveness (28) and that associated PAS-positive VM networks
that also express laminin represent a biomarker in human
melanomas associated with increased clinical mortality (29).
The molecular mechanisms governing melanoma VM, and
their potential relationship to MMIC and melanoma growth,
are largely unknown. We hypothesized that global gene
expression analyses of tumorigenic, MMIC-enriched ABCB5þ
melanoma subpopulations, capable of VM, vis-a-vis ABCB5
melanoma bulk populations, might serve to identify molecular
signaling pathways responsible for VM and, as a result, allow
investigation of their potential relevance to melanoma growth.

VEGFR-1þ cells by magnetic bead cell sorting with antiABCB5 (6) or anti-VEGFR-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb;
R&D Systems) as described (7). Assessment of purity of
melanoma cell isolates and determination of cell viability
following magnetic cell sorting were carried out and yielded
results as described previously (7).
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from ABCB5þ and ABCB5 human
melanoma cells or HUVEC cultures with the RT2 qPCR Grade
RNA isolation kit (SABiosciences). Standard cDNA synthesis
reactions were carried out and the reverse transcriptase
product was amplified by gene-specific primer pairs; b-actin
was used as a normalizing control. The primers for ABCB5
detection were as described previously (5), primers for
VEGFR-1 (Genbank accession no. NM_002019) detection were
50 -GACCTGGAGTTACCCTGATGAAA-30 (forward) and 50 GGCATGGGAATTGCTTTGG-30 (reverse) and for b-actin
detection 50 -CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT-30 (forward) and 50 AGTACTCCGTGTGGATCGGC-30 (reverse). Samples were
assayed by Sybergreen chemistry and kinetic PCR (ABI 7300
Sequence Detector; Applied Biosystems). The relative
amounts of transcripts were analyzed by the 2(DDCt) method
as described previously (5, 7, 30). Statistical differences
between mRNA expression levels were determined by the
nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. A 2-sided value of P <
0.05 was considered significant.

Melanoma cells and culture methods
Authenticated human melanoma cell lines were obtained
from the NCI/NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program or
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and melanoma cell
lines were cultured and passaged for fewer than 6 months as
described (5–7). Clinical cutaneous melanoma cells were
derived from surgical specimen according to Institutional
Review Board–approved human subjects research protocols
as described previously (7). Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured
according to the supplier's protocol.

Global gene expression microarray analyses
Microarray analyses were carried out on purified ABCB5þ
(n ¼ 5) and ABCB5 (n ¼ 5) cell subsets derived from the
established human melanoma cell lines G3361 and A375 and
from 3 distinct clinical melanoma specimen previously characterized in our laboratory with regard to ABCB5 expression
and MMIC phenotype in human melanoma xenotransplantation assays (7). Total RNA was extracted, processed, and
hybridized as described previously (30) onto Affymetrix
human HG-U133Plus2 GeneChip microarrays (Affymetrix).
Statistical analysis of microarray results was carried out as
described previously (30). The expression data set in its
entirety is available through GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)
DataSets (accession number GSE26569). Functional gene networks were generated by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems; www.ingenuity.com) by mapping each gene
identifier to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity
Pathways Knowledge Base. These focus genes were overlaid
onto a global molecular network developed from information
contained in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Focus
gene networks were then algorithmically generated on the
basis of their connectivity and subsequently analyzed to
identify the biological functions that were most significant
to the genes in the network.

Cell isolation
ABCB5þ-purified (ABCB5þ) or VEGFR-1þ-purified (VEGFRþ
1 ) cells were isolated by positive selection and ABCB5þdepleted (ABCB5) or VEGFR-1þ-depleted (VEGFR-1) cell
populations were generated by removing ABCB5þ cells or

Western analysis
Total cell lysates were harvested from logarithmically growing cultures of the human melanoma cell lines MALME-3M,
SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, UACC-62, UACC-257,
M14, and MDA-MB-435 and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and

Western assay to detect relative levels of ABCB5 (mAb 3C21D12; ref. 6) and a-tubulin (mAb clone DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich)
by LI-COR Odyssey IR imaging system densitometry. Western
blots for the analysis of VEGFR-1 expression were carried out
with rabbit anti-VEGFR-1 antibody (Epitomics) or mouse antib-actin antibody as a control (Cell Signaling Technology) and
horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary goat anti-mouse
antibody or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma), respectively.
The reactive bands were detected by the addition of chemoluminescent substrate (ECL; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
Corp.).
Flow cytometry
The analysis of cell surface coexpression of ABCB5 with
VEGFR-1 was carried out by dual-color flow cytometry as
described (7), using anti-ABCB5 mAb or isotype control mAb,
followed by counterstaining with APC-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab as above, and phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated anti-VEGFR-1 mAb (R&D Systems) or PEconjugated isotype control mAb (BD PharMingen). Statistical
differences between expression levels of markers were determined by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. A 2-sided
value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
In vitro vasculogenic differentiation and tube formation
assays
VEGF-dependent induction of CD144 and of von Willebrand factor (VWF) expression and formation of capillary-like
tube structures by human melanoma cells was assayed on
growth factor–reduced Matrigel, a basement membrane
matrix preparation (BD Biosciences). Purified ABCB5þ or
ABCB5 or unsegregated human melanoma cells were seeded
into culture slide wells in medium 199 containing 5% fetal calf
serum (31) in the presence or absence of VEGF (100 ng/mL).
After 48-hour incubation, cells were fixed and then incubated
with rabbit anti-CD144 polyclonal Ab (Bethyl Laboratories) or
rabbit anti-VWF polyclonal Ab (Dako) overnight at 4 C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Texas
red–conjugated secondary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories), washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vecta
Laboratories) supplemented with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then analyzed by fluorescent microscopy as
described previously (8). For tube formation assays, melanoma cells were seeded into culture slide wells as above and
then pretreated with medium alone, rabbit anti-VEGFR-1 Ab
(10 mg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit isotype
control Ab (10 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) prior to stimulation
with VEGF (100 ng/mL). Tube formation was detected by
phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope) after 24 hours of incubation. For quantitative analysis
of tube formation and length and for the determination of
CD144 and VWF expression at 48 hours, 3 randomly selected
microscopy fields were photographed per experimental condition. Tube formation was analyzed by Image J software
available from the NIH Web site as described previously
(32). For quantification of CD144 and VWF expression, positive cells were counted by Neurolucida 8.10 software (MBF
Bioscience). Differences among groups were analyzed by one-

way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Differences
with P < 0.05 values were considered statistically significant.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
The following primary Abs were used: rat anti-laminin B2
(Abcam), mouse anti-ABCB5 (5–7), rabbit anti-CD271 (RayBiotech), and goat anti-VEGFR-1 (R&D Systems). Isotypematched irrelevant Abs served as negative controls. The secondary Abs were goat anti-rat IgG-HRP and horse anti-mouse
IgG-HRP (Biolegend) for immunohistochemistry and Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa Fluor 488 goat antimouse IgG2a, Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa
Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG3, Alexa Flour 488 donkey antimouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) for immunofluorescence staining. Immunohistochemistry was carried out by the 2-step horseradish peroxidase
method as described previously (7). Immunofluorescence double staining was carried out as described previously (7). Quantitative analysis of laminin expression (percent positively
staining area of sections) was carried out by the ImageJ
program, and statistical differences between expression levels
were determined by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test.
In situ hybridization
ABCB5 RNA probes were prepared as follows: PCR-derived
RNA probe templates were synthesized by introducing the T7
promoter into the antisense strand and the SP6 promoter into
the sense strand. The primer pair (50 -TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGTCTGGCTTTTTCCCTTCTTGAC-30 ) and (50 GATTT AGGTGACACTATAGAAATTCAAGCTGGACGAATGA
CCCCA-30 ) was used to generate the DNA template for antisense and sense RNA probes spanning 200 base pairs of
human ABCB5 cDNA. RNA probe labeling with digoxigenin
(DIG) and in situ hybridizations (ISH) were carried out as
described previously (33).
Melanoma transfection with VEGFR-1 short hairpin
RNA
Two distinct shRNA plasmids targeting human VEGFR-1
mRNA, and negative control short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
plasmids without homology to human mRNA, also containing
the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker, were purchased
from SuperArray (SureSilencing; SuperArray). Human melanoma cells were transfected with the SuperFECT transfection
reagent (SuperArray) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For determination of VEGFR-1 knockdown efficiency by
real-time PCR or Western blotting, cells were harvested and
total RNA was purified 48 hours posttransfection or cell
lysates were prepared 96 hours posttransfection, respectively.
Cells were harvested for use in xenotransplantation assays 24
hours posttransfection, when flow cytometric GFP fluorescence measurements at the Fl1 spectrum showed more than
90% transfection efficiency in both VEGFR-1 shRNAs- and
control shRNA-transfected melanoma cultures.
Animals
BALB/c nude mice, NOD/SCID mice, and NSG mice
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were

maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of
Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School and
experiments were carried out according to the approved
experimental protocols.
Human to mouse melanoma xenotransplantation
Human to mouse melanoma xenografts were established by
subcutaneous injection of human G3361 or A375 or of clinical
patient-derived human melanoma cells in NOD/SCID or NSG
mice as described previously (7, 11). Equal numbers of
ABCB5þ or ABCB5 cells derived from 3 distinct patients
were xenografted into NSG mice (equal number of replicates
for 104 or 103 cells per recipient). VEGFR-1þ or VEGFR
melanoma cells were xenografted into NOD/SCID mice at
106 cells per recipient. VEGFR-1 shRNA–transfected (two
distinct shRNAs) or control shRNA-transfected melanomas
were xenografted into NOD/SCID mice at 107 cells per recipient (A375) or 106 cells per recipient (A375, G3361, specimens
derived from n ¼ 3 distinct patients). Tumor xenografts were
harvested for histologic analysis in their entirety at 7 weeks
(VEGFR-1þ or VEGFR-1 melanoma cell-derived xenografts)
or 3 weeks (shRNA-transfected xenografts) after tumor cell
inoculation. Differences in tumor volume (TV), determined as
described previously (7), were statistically compared by the
nonparametric Mann–Whitney test, with a 2-sided value of
P < 0.05 considered significant.

Results
VEGFR-1 is preferentially expressed by ABCB5þ human
melanoma cells
Melanoma growth is driven by MMIC identified by expression of ABCB5, as previously shown in human melanoma to
NOD/SCID mouse tumor xenotransplantation models (7).
Higher frequencies of cells capable of tumor initiation have
been observed in side-by-side comparative studies in more
severely immunocompromised NSG xenograft recipients (22).
These findings pointed to heterogeneity among melanoma
cells with regard to evasion of host antitumor immune
responses, consistent with the recently shown existence of
immunoevasive subpopulations of ABCB5þ or CD271
(NGFR)þ MMIC (8, 25, 34). The existence of MMIC has recently
been confirmed in more immunocompromised xenotransplantation models, including NSG mice, based on CD271
expression (34). Likewise, we also find ABCB5þ melanoma
subpopulations enriched for MMIC in comparative tumorigenicity assays involving ABCB5þ versus ABCB5 melanoma
cell grafts to NSG recipients. Of 12 aggregate mice injected
with ABCB5 melanoma cells (derived from 3 distinct
patients), only one mouse xenografted with the highest cell
dose (104 cells per inoculum) generated a tumor, consistent
with the previously observed low rate of tumor formation by
ABCB5 or CD271 melanoma bulk populations in primary
xenograft recipients (refs. 7, 34; Fig. 1A). In contrast, 7 of 12
mice injected with ABCB5þ cells (at identical doses of 104 or
103 cells per inoculum derived from the same patients) formed
tumors (Fig. 1A), showing significant enrichment of tumorigenic capacity of ABCB5þ MMIC even in more immunocom-

promised NSG mice (P < 0.05). Remarkably, we found the
MMIC markers ABCB5 (7) and CD271 (34) preferentially
coexpressed on the same tumor subpopulation in clinical
human melanoma specimens (Fig. 1B). Moreover, preferential
coexpression of ABCB5 and CD271 in human melanomas has
also been documented by the Weissman Laboratory at Stanford University (Alexander Boiko and Irving Weissman, personal communication), indicating significant overlap of these
MMIC populations.
To identify differentially expressed genes that might contribute to tumorigenic growth in MMIC-enriched melanoma
subpopulations compared with tumor bulk populations,
we first carried out microarray analyses on purified ABCB5þ
(n ¼ 5) and ABCB5 (n ¼ 5) cell subsets derived from 3
distinct patient-derived melanoma specimens or the established human melanoma cell lines G3361 and A375, all
previously characterized in our laboratory by human melanoma xenotransplantation assays with regard to ABCB5
expression and MMIC phenotype (7). Using this approach
(30), 399 genes were identified that were differentially
expressed (P < 0.05) between ABCB5þ and ABCB5 melanoma subpopulations (Supplementary Table 1), in addition
to ABCB5 itself, shown overexpressed in ABCB5þ purified
populations by real-time PCR (P < 0.05). One identified
functional gene network, validated by PCR-based gene
expression analyses in ABCB5þ melanoma cell subsets,
showed key molecules of vasculogenesis (the ability of tumor
cells to differentiate along endothelial lines), and of angiogenesis (the ability of tumor cells to induce in-growth and
proliferation of mature stromal blood vessels), specifically
VEGFR-1, PTK2 (FAK), MET (HGFR), NRP2, and ETS1, to be
significantly overexpressed in ABCB5þ melanoma subsets
(Fig. 1C). Preferential expression of VEGFR-1 by ABCB5þ
versus ABCB5 subpopulations was confirmed by real-time
PCR at the mRNA level (Fig. 1D, 1.9  0.5-fold vs. 0.3  0.1fold expression compared with detection in HUVEC, mean
 SE, P < 0.001) and was also shown by dual-color flow
cytometry at the protein level (9.6%  2.2% vs. 0.9%  0.2%
of cells, respectively, mean  SE, n ¼ 10, P < 0.001; Fig. 1E).
In addition, immunofluorescence double staining analysis of
clinical human melanoma specimens, clinical human melanoma xenografts, and human melanoma cell line xenografts, using human VEGFR-1-specific mAb, also revealed
specific coexpression of VEGFR-1 on ABCB5þ melanoma
cells in situ (Fig. 1F).
VEGFR-1 signaling is required for CD144þ VM by
human melanoma cells
Because VEGFR-1 is associated with tumor vasculogenesis and considering that VM implicates primitive, pluripotential tumor cells (27), we next sought to determine
whether VEGFR-1 is functionally expressed by MMICenriched ABCB5þ melanoma cells and whether signaling
through VEGFR-1 is required for CD144þ VM differentiation
of human melanoma cells. First, we evaluated the effects of
VEGF treatment on CD144 and VWF expression by purified
ABCB5þ or ABCB5 melanoma subpopulations. VEGF (100
ng/mL; ref. 31) significantly and preferentially induced

We found that ABCB5, previously shown preferentially coexpressed with the VM markers CD144 and TIE1 in distributions distinct from CD31þ mature tumor vessels (7), can be
detected in clinical human melanomas (Fig. 3A) and in
experimental xenografts established from patient-derived

(Fig. 3C). The patterned channel-like networks (33) were
highlighted via immunochemical laminin reactivity, preferential cellular and spatial association of ABCB5 expression
with secreted laminin reactivity in patterned networks as
shown in immunofluorescence double-labeling studies
(Fig. 3A–C, right), and histochemical PAS reactivity
(Fig. 3D) in vivo, consistent with established features of
VM (27, 29). Identical VM patterned networks of ABCB5
protein expression determined by protein immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A–C) were also detected by ABCB5 mRNA
ISH (Fig. 3E). ABCB5 protein and mRNA expression
also correlated significantly when assayed across a panel

In further support of the preferential association of
ABCB5 with VM, ABCB5 mAb, but not control Ig, administered intravenously to human melanoma xenograft-bearing
mice showed specific binding to cell membranes of tumor
cells in the pattern of anastomosing channels (Fig. 4A),
confirming the intimate association of ABCB5þ melanoma
cells with apparently communicating VM channel lumens.
Conventional histology (Fig. 4B) disclosed channels to be
associated with linear lamellae of PAS-positive extracellular
matrix (ECM; depicted in the inset, Fig. 4B) intimately
associated with tumor cells (highlighted with arrows,

surrounded by tumor cells whereas other channels also
containing erythrocytes were lined by ECM consistent with
basement membrane [Fig. 4C, middle (arrows), Fig. 4C,
right (asterisks)] and surrounded by tumor cells and thus
were structurally consistent with "vasculogenic mimicry," as
defined by Maniotis and colleagues (27).
VEGFR-1 is required for in vivo VM and efficient tumor
growth
First, to confirm that VEGFR-1 is expressed on a tumorigenic
subpopulation of ABCB5þ melanoma cells, we investigated the
tumorigenicity of purified VEGFR-1þ and VEGFR-1 melanoma subpopulations in vivo. VEGFR-1–dependent cell sorting
was carried out by immunomagnetic selection as described (7)
and groups of mice (n ¼ 14 replicates per group) were
xenografted subcutaneously with VEGFR-1þ or VEGFR-1
melanoma cells representing 2 distinct patients and 1

melanoma cell line at 106 cells per inoculum, a dose previously
shown to consistently initiate tumor formation when ABCB5þ
cells were used (7). Purified VEGFR-1þ melanoma cells were
consistently capable of tumor initiation, showing that VEGFR1 is preferentially expressed on a tumorigenic subpopulation of
ABCB5þ melanoma cells. In addition, consistent with the
highly selective expression of VEGFR-1 on ABCB5þ melanoma
subpopulations, we found that purified VEGFR-1þ cells
enriched for ABCB5þ MMIC (Fig. 1E) gave rise to significantly
larger tumors than VEGFR-1 melanoma cells, which contained lower proportions of ABCB5þ MMIC (TV 131.0  34.5
vs. 49.87  21.0 mm3, respectively; mean  SE, P < 0.01; Fig. 5A).
Intriguingly, despite a capacity of ABCB5þ-containing
VEGFR-1 melanoma cell populations for tumor initiation,
VEGFR-1 melanoma populations did not, unlike VEGFR-1þ
melanoma cell-derived xenografts, exhibit tumor cell–derived
human laminin production (Fig. 5B). These results indicate
that VEGFR-1þ/ABCB5þ MMICs are primarily responsible for
VM.
To examine the functional role of VEGFR-1 in melanoma VM
and to dissect mechanistically whether VEGFR-1 expressed by
human melanoma cells is required for more efficient tumor
growth, we next investigated the effects of selective VEGFR-1
knockdown in vivo. VEGFR-1 shRNA transfection (2 distinct
shRNAs) of human melanoma cells derived from 3 melanoma
patients and 2 melanoma cell lines inhibited VEGFR-1 mRNA
expression by up to 93% (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C, top) and significantly
blocked VEGFR-1 protein expression (Fig. 5D, bottom). Patterned networks of ABCB5þ VM expression were detected in
tumors that formed from control shRNA-transfected melanoma inocula (Fig. 5D, top) but were not found, despite
detectable, nonpatterned areas of ABCB5 positivity, in tumors
that resulted from xenotransplantation of VEGFR-1 shRNA–
transfected melanoma cells (Fig. 5D, bottom). VM formation
within tumors, also evaluated by quantitative image analysis
technology (7) to assess the pixilated density of associated
laminin immunoreactivity per cross-sectional area, was inhibited by 86% (Fig. 5E) in tumors that formed from VEGFR-1
shRNA–transfected melanoma inocula compared with those
that originated from controls (laminin immunoreactivity 0.8%
 0.2% (n ¼ 6) versus 5.6%  1.9% (n ¼ 6), respectively; mean 
SE, P < 0.01). In contrast, VEGFR-1 knockdown in human
melanoma cells exerted no significant effects on tumor angiogenesis, as determined by immunohistochemical staining
for the marker of mature (murine) endothelium CD31,
as documented via detection of conventional tubular, occasionally branching blood vessels (Fig. 5D). Importantly, inhibition of VEGFR-1–dependent ABCB5þlamininþ VM formation
resulted in marked inhibition of tumor growth, with mean TV
inhibited by 93% in recipients of VEGFR-1 shRNA- versus
control-transfected melanoma inocula (TV ¼ 5.3  2.3 mm3
(n ¼ 28) versus 56.9  28.3 mm3 (n ¼ 15), respectively; mean 
SE, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 5F). The additional finding that VM laminin
positivity correlated negatively with tumor size within the
subset of untreated control tumors (Spearman rank correlation r ¼ 0.6) was consistent with a cause-and-effect relationship between inhibition of VEGFR-1–dependent laminin
production and inhibition of tumor growth.

Discussion
Our study reveals several novel insights: First, ABCB5þ
MMICs previously found to be responsible for VM differ from
melanoma bulk populations by preferentially expressing
VEGFR-1. Second, VEGFR-1 signaling is required for MMICdependent VM differentiation and VM-associated laminin
production. Finally, VEGFR-1 expression is required for efficient tumor growth.
VEGFR-1 is a tyrosine protein kinase and src oncogene
family member and receptor for VEGF-A. When expressed by
endothelial cells, VEGFR-1 regulates physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis (35–37). In addition, VEGFR-1, when
expressed by cells of the hematopoietic lineage, possesses
angiogenesis-independent functions in malignant disease by
enabling cancer host hematopoietic progenitors to establish
premetastatic cell clusters and modulate ECM composition of
the metastatic niche, resulting in enhanced tumor growth and
metastasis (36, 38). VEGF/VEGFR-1 signaling has previously
been shown to function as an autocrine mechanism that can
regulate tumor growth (39). However, a malignant, growthpromoting role of preferentially tumor-initiating cellexpressed VEGFR-1 has not been described to date.
Consistent with previous reports (39, 40), we found VEGFR1 to be expressed by human melanoma cells. Importantly, the
present study revealed VEGFR-1 expression to be predominantly restricted to ABCB5þ MMIC among human melanoma
cells, which raised the possibility of a MMIC-related function
of this receptor. Indeed, our study identifies VEGFR-1 signaling as a novel molecular mechanism responsible for MMICdependent VM and VM-associated laminin production (28, 41,
42), a previously identified biomarker in human melanomas
associated with aggressiveness (28) and increased clinical
mortality (29). Furthermore, our results show that functional
VEGFR-1 expression by MMIC is required not only for melanoma VM and associated laminin production but also for
more rapid tumorigenic growth, providing a potential explanation for the previously established correlation between VM
and poor clinical prognosis in this malignancy. Mechanistically, our study indicates that VEGFR-1 knockdown-mediated
inhibition of tumor growth resulted at least in part through
blockade of MMIC-dependent laminin production, because
this ECM constituent represents a potent melanoma mitogenic proliferative factor through defined signaling pathways
(43). It is noteworthy in this regard that laminin is also a key
component of ECM preparations that exert potent protumorigenic effects when exogenously added to human melanoma
grafts in experimental xenotransplantation models (22, 25).
Our demonstration that MMIC-expressed VEGFR-1 is
required for tumor growth extends the known repertoire of
tumor-initiating cell functions responsible for initiating or
sustaining malignant progression, which include the tumorinitiating cell-defining functions of self-renewal, differentiation, and sustained proliferative capacity, as well as proangiogenic functions (25, 44) and immunomodulatory functions
related to the evasion of host antitumor immunity (8, 25).
Recently, proof-of-principle has been established for the
potential therapeutic utility of targeting tumor-initiating cells,

including in human melanoma (7, 45, 46). Therefore, the newly
discovered role of VEGFR-1 function in MMIC-dependent
tumorigenic growth is relevant to the design of novel MMICtargeted potential melanoma therapies. Specifically, our findings provide a rationale to investigate in future studies whether
VEGFR-1-dependent, protumorigenic interactions of MMIC
with VEGF-producing malignant or nonmalignant host cell
populations in the tumor microenvironment can be specifically
disrupted in a translationally relevant manner to inhibit tumor
growth.
