Abstract
CD44 is a marker of cancer stem-like cells and epithelial–mesenchymal transition that is overexpressed in
many cancer types, including thyroid carcinoma. At extracellular and intramembranous domains, CD44
undergoes sequential metalloprotease- and g-secretase–mediated proteolytic cleavage, releasing the intracellular
protein fragment CD44-ICD, which translocates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription. Here, we show
that CD44-ICD binds to the transcription factor CREB, increasing S133 phosphorylation and CREB-mediated gene
transcription. CD44-ICD enhanced CREB recruitment to the cyclin D1 promoter, promoting cyclin D1 transcription and cell proliferation. Thyroid carcinoma cells harboring activated RET/PTC, RAS, or BRAF oncogenes
exhibited CD44 cleavage and CD44-ICD accumulation. Chemical blockade of RET/PTC, BRAF, metalloprotease,
or g-secretase were each sufﬁcient to blunt CD44 processing. Furthermore, thyroid cancer cell proliferation was
obstructed by RNA interference–mediated knockdown of CD44 or inhibition of g-secretase and adoptive CD44ICD overexpression rescued cell proliferation. Together, these ﬁndings reveal a CD44-CREB signaling pathway
that is needed to sustain cancer cell proliferation, potentially offering new molecular targets for therapeutic
intervention in thyroid carcinoma. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1449–58. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
CD44 is a glycosylated transmembrane glycoprotein that is
implicated in tumor growth and metastasis (1–3). CD44 undergoes intramembrane proteolysis by metalloprotease that
cleaves the extracellular juxtamembrane stem domain, and,
then, by g-secretase that cleaves the transmembrane domain
(4–7). The ﬁrst cleavage results in the shedding of the ectodomain (ecto-CD44) and the release of the membrane-bound
CD44 C-terminal fragment (CD44-CTF). The second cleavage
causes the release of the CD44 intracellular domain fragment
(CD44-ICD; refs. 5, 6). Shedding of ecto-CD44 regulates cell–
extracellular matrix interaction (8), whereas CD44-ICD translocates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription (7).
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) often features RET/PTC
or BRAF oncoproteins, both of which signal through the
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (9–11).
RET/PTC result from the fusion of the tyrosine kinase domain
of the RET receptor with the N-terminus of heterologous

proteins (9). RET tyrosine 1062 (Y1062) plays an important
role in RET and RET/PTC signaling, acting as the binding site
for several proteins, thus leading to ERK and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT signaling (12–16).
CD44 cleavage produces CD44-ICD in cells transformed by
oncogenic RET point mutants (17). CD44 is overexpressed in
PTC and in cell lines harboring RET/PTC or BRAF oncogenes
(18, 19). Here, we show that CD44-ICD triggers activation of the
CREB transcription factor; in thyroid cancer cells, RET/PTCBRAF signaling cascade uses such a CD44-ICD-CREB axis to
sustain cell proliferation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
TPC-1 and BCPAP cell lines were obtained, respectively, in
1990 from M. Nagao (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan) and in 1994 from N. Fabien (CNRS, Oullins,
France). The anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines ACT-1
(NRAS Q61K), HTH7 (NRAS Q61R), HTH74 (negative for HRAS,
KRAS, and NRAS mutations) and C643 (HRAS G13R) were
obtained in 2005 from N. Onoda (Osaka University of Medicine,
Japan; ACT-1) and from N.E. Heldin (University Hospital,
Uppsala, Sweden; HTH7, HTH74, and C643). These cell lines
were DNA proﬁled by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis in
2009 (20) and shown to be unique and identical to those
reported in Schweppe and colleagues (21). In brief, 15 STR
loci were tested by using the Applied Biosystems AmpFLSTR
Identiﬁler kit (ABI no. 4322288); DNA proﬁles were compared
manually with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
database and to the DNA proﬁles reported by Schweppe and
colleagues (21). Human primary culture of thyroid cells (P5)

were obtained from F. Curcio (University Udine, Italy) in 2003
and passaged in our laboratory, as described (22), for fewer
than 2 months after resuscitation. They were tested in 2010 by
proliferation rate and expression of thyroid differentiation
markers (TG, TPO, and TSHR). Nthy-ori 3-1 (hereafter referred
to as NTHY), a human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line
immortalized by the SV40 large T gene, was obtained from
European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC) in 2010. They
were tested by ECACC for identity veriﬁcation by DNA proﬁling
of STR sequences and were passaged in our laboratory for
fewer than 3 months after resuscitation. PC Cl 3 (hereafter
referred to "PC") is a differentiated thyroid follicular cell line
derived from 18-month-old Fischer rats in our laboratory in
1987 (23). They were kept in culture for fewer than 3 months
after resuscitation and tested in 2010 by proliferation rate,
dependence on 6 hormones for growth and expression of
thyroid differentiation markers (TG, TPO, and TSHR).
HEK293T cells were purchased in 2006 from the ATCC and
tested by ATCC for identity by DNA proﬁling of STR sequences.
HEK293T were passaged in our laboratory for fewer than 3
months after resuscitation. The PC ICD and BCPAP ICD cell
lines were obtained by a stable transfection with the CD44-ICD
construct by using the Fugene HD reagent from Roche Diagnostics. A pool of several cell clones was isolated by G418
selection. Transient transfections were carried out with the
Fugene HD reagent. All these cell lines were grown in standard
conditions as detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Plasmids
The RET/PTC constructs used in this study were cloned in
pBABE or pcDNA3(Myc-His; Invitrogen) and described elsewhere (14). RET/PTC3(K) is a kinase-dead mutant, carrying
the substitution of the catalytic lysine (residue 758 in fulllength RET) with a methionine. In RET/PTC3(4YF) mutant the
4 major autophosphorylation sites (Y826, Y1015, Y1029, and
Y1062 in full-length RET) are mutated to phenylalanine; Y1062
has been added back in RET/PTC3(3YF). These mutants were
generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). BRAFV600E and HRAS(V12)
plasmids are described elsewhere (14). The full-length rat CD44
was cloned into pDEST47 vector and tagged at the C-ter with
GFP (17); CD44-ICD was cloned in pDEST47 (GFP tagged),
pDEST40 (V5 tagged), and pCDNA 3.1 (myc tagged; ref. 17).
Antibodies, compounds, and proteins
The antibody against the cytosolic portion of CD44
(CD44cyto) and anti-RET are described elsewhere (14, 17). A
list of commercial antibodies, compounds, and recombinant
proteins used in this study is provided in Supplementary
Methods.
Cell growth and staining
For growth curves, cells were seeded in triplicate and
counted at the indicated time points. Thyroid cancer cells
were maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium
(DMEM) 2.5% FBS and PC cells in medium supplemented with
5% calf serum and without TSH. DNA synthesis was measured
by the 50 -bromo-30 -deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling and Detec-

ELISA assay
Extracellular shedding of the soluble ectodomain of human
standard CD44 (CD44st) was measured using the Instant
ELISA (Bender MedSystems) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Conditioned media from cell cultures were analyzed in triplicate at 450 nmol/L with an microplate reader
(Model 550; Bio-Rad).
Protein studies
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments
were conducted according to standard procedures. For nuclear
extraction, cells were lysed by shearing with 15 passages
through a 26-gauge needle mounted in a 1-mL syringe. Nuclei
were recovered by centrifugation at 3,000  g for 10 minutes
(Supplementary Methods).
Pull-down assay
The GST-CD44-ICD vector codes for a chimeric protein with
CD44-ICD fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST). It was
generated by the Invitrogen Gateway technique using as donor
the pDEST47-CD44-ICD vector and as recipient the pDEST15
vector. GST-CD44-ICD was puriﬁed from pDEST15-CD44ICD–transformed bacterial lysates using glutathione Sepharose beads. Recombinant proteins containing the different
domains of CREB fused to GST are described elsewhere
(24). Pull-down assays were carried out by standard procedures
(Supplementary Methods).
Reporter assay
All the Fireﬂy luciferase reporters were kindly provided by J.
S. Gutkind (NIH, Bethesda, MD; refs. 25–28). Twenty-four hours
after seeding, the cells were transiently transfected in triplicate
with reporters together with pRL-null, a plasmid expressing the
enzyme Renilla luciferase, used as an internal control (Promega
Corporation). Luciferase assays were carried out according to
standard procedures (Supplementary Methods).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin was extracted from CD44-ICD or empty vector–transfected HEK293T cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was done with the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) according
to manufacturer's instructions, as described in Supplementary Methods.

against human CD44 were from OriGene Technologies
(TR314080 IDs: TI356313, TI356314, and TI356316). Short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) pRS plasmid TR20003 was used as a
negative control. Transfection was done in 100-mm dishes
using Fugene HD reagent (Roche) with 4 mg shRNA construct.
Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection.
In vitro PP2A dephosphorylation assay
Recombinant HIS-CREB was in vitro phosphorylated by the
catalytic subunit of PKA in a buffer containing 1 mmol/L ATP,
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L HEPES, and 10%
glycerol for 1 hour at 30 C. Phosphorylated CREB was incubated in a phosphatase buffer (40 mmol/L Tris HCl, 34 mmol/L
MgCl2, 4 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L DTT, and 0.05 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin) for 1 hour at 37 C with 10 mU of PP2A
catalytic subunit. GST-CD44-ICD, or the GST backbone alone,
were added to the samples. The reaction was terminated by
adding SDS gel loading dye and samples were run on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel. Phospho-CREB signal was detected with
anti-phospho(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody and the

amount of CREB in each reaction was estimated with antiHIS antibody.
Statistical analysis
The 2-tailed unpaired Student t test (normal distributions
and equal variances) was used for statistical analysis. Differences were signiﬁcant when P < 0.05. Statistical analysis was
done using the Graph Pad InStat software program, version
3.06.3.

Results
CD44-ICD stimulates CRE-mediated transcription
We analyzed the capability of a GFP-tagged CD44-ICD
construct to trans-activate a panel of promoter elements,
including AP-1 (activating protein-1), SRF (serum response
factor), TCF (ternary complex factor), Gli (Glioma-associated
oncogene homolog), NF-kB, and CRE (cAMP-responsive
element) reporters (25–28). CD44-ICD strongly (about 10-fold,
P < 0.01) activated the CRE reporter in HEK293T cells, but not
the other promoters (Fig. 1A). This was a speciﬁc feature of the

reporter assay in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged full-length CD44 or CD44-ICD (ICD). C, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected
with CycD1(CCND1)-LUC and CREB siRNA or control scrambled siRNA (siCTR). CREB silencing and CD44-ICD (ICD) expression was veriﬁed by immunoblot.
In A–C, cotransfected Renilla luciferase was used for normalization. Results are reported as fold change with respect to the empty vector (). Triplicates  SD
are shown. P values were determined by the 2-tailed unpaired Student t test. CD44 or CD44-ICD (ICD) expression was veriﬁed by immunoblot with anti-GFP
antibody (inset). D, immunoblot stained with cyclin D1 antibody of HEK293T cells cotransfected with CD44-ICD-GFP together with p300 or p300LYRRdominant negative mutant. CD44-ICD expression was veriﬁed with anti-GFP. Anti-tubulin was used for normalization. E, HEK293T cells were
transiently transfected with CD44-ICD. Mock or anti-CREB immunoprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by semiquantitative PCR with primers spanning the
CRE site on the CCND1 promoter. Input DNA levels are shown for normalization. Data in D and E are representative of 3 independent experiments.

cleaved CD44-ICD, because full-length GFP-tagged CD44 did
not signiﬁcantly (P > 0.05) stimulate the CRE reporter (Fig. 1B).

CD44-ICD sustains CREB/p300-mediated CCND1
expression
CRE elements bind the CREB (cAMP-responsive element
binding protein) family of transcription factors (29, 30). Cyclin
D1 (CCND1) is a prototypic CREB transcriptional target, containing a CRE element upstream of the mRNA start site (at 58
bp; refs. 25, 31). We studied the effect of CD44-ICD on a CCND1luciferase reporter. HEK293T cells were kept without serum for
24 hours after the transfection to reduce the growth factor–
dependent CCND1 promoter activity. CD44-ICD stimulated
(approximately 12-fold, P < 0.01) the CCND1 promoter (Fig. 1C,
left).
We silenced endogenous CREB by transiently transfecting
CREB siRNA (siCREB) in CD44-ICD–transfected HEK293T
cells; CREB knockdown (about 70% of reduction) was veriﬁed
by immunoblot (Fig. 1C, right). CREB silencing, but not a
scrambled control, obstructed CD44-ICD–mediated activation
of CCND1-luciferase (Fig. 1C, left, P < 0.01).
The coactivator CBP/p300 binds to active S133-phosphorylated CREB and triggers CREB-mediated gene transcription
(32). Previous data showed that CD44-ICD stimulates p300mediated transactivation (33). Thus, we cotransfected CD44ICD with p300 or a p300-dominant negative construct (LYRR;
ref. 34). CD44-ICD upregulated (about 3-fold) endogenous
CCND1 expression; the p300-dominant negative mutant
blocked CD44-ICD–induced CCND1 expression, whereas wt
p300 slightly increased it (Fig. 1D).
Phosphorylated CREB is recruited to CRE sites in DNA (35).
We carried out a ChIP to measure CREB binding to the CRE
element of the CCND1 promoter. CD44-ICD expression
increased the binding of CREB to the CCND1 promoter by
about 5-fold (Fig. 1E).
Taken together, these results showed that CD44-ICD stimulates CREB recruitment to CCND1 promoter and CREB/p300mediated transcription of CCND1.
CD44-ICD increases CREB phosphorylation on serine
133
Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with CD44-ICD and phosphoS133 (CREB principal
activation site) levels were measured by immunoblot. As a
positive control, we treated cells with the adenylate cyclase
activator forskolin (FSK). Besides CREB, the phospho-CREB
antibody recognizes phosphorylated CREB family members
CREM (30 kDa) and ATF-1 (38 kDa). Expression of CD44-ICD
induced a robust increase of pS133 CREB as well as of phosphorylated ATF-1 (Fig. 2A, left).
Activated pS133 CREB binds p300 and this results in a
transcriptionally active complex. Thus, we analyzed CREBp300 interaction by immunoprecipitating CREB from nuclear
extracts of HEK293T cells cotransfected with CD44-ICD and
p300, and staining the immunoblot with p300 antibody. CD44ICD, as well as FSK treatment, increased (about 5-fold) the
CREB-p300 interaction (Fig. 2A, right).

Figure 2. A, left, nuclear extracts were obtained by HEK293T transiently
transfected with CD44-ICD (ICD) and pS133 CREB levels were
determined by immunoblot. FSK (40 mmol/L 30 minutes) was used as a
positive control. Anti-CREB was used for normalization. Right, nuclear
extracts were obtained by HEK293T transiently transfected with CD44ICD (ICD); anti-CREB immunocomplexes (1 mg) were immunoblotted
with p300. Lysis buffer alone was used as a negative control (buffer); FSK
was used as a positive control. Anti-CREB and anti-p300 were used for
normalization. B, HEK293T were transiently transfected with V5-tagged
CD44-ICD (ICD) or empty vector (). Proteins were immunoprecipitated
(1 mg) with anti-CREB. CREB antibody incubated with no lysate (buffer)
was used as a control. Immunocomplexes were blotted with V5; CREB
antibody was used for normalization. C, CD44-ICD-GST (30 mg) was
incubated with 1 mg of recombinant CREB (CREB-REC). Complexes were
recovered by glutathione beads and analyzed by immunoblot with antiCREB. CREB input is reported for normalization. D, top, schematic
representation of different portions of CREB used in pull-down assay;
bottom, the indicated portions of GST-CREB were used (30 mg) to
pull down myc-tagged CD44-ICD transiently expressed in HEK293T cells
(1 mg). GST alone was used as negative control. Data are representative
of 3 independent experiments.

These results showed that CD44-ICD expression increases
levels of S133-phosphorylated CREB and its binding to p300.
CD44-ICD forms a protein complex with CREB

CD44 Cleavage Increases CREB Phosphorylation

verify whether the interaction between CREB and CD44-ICD
was direct or mediated by other proteins, we carried out a pulldown assay using recombinant CREB and GST-CD44-ICD
proteins. Figure 2C shows that CREB and CD44-ICD readily
interacted in vitro.
We used different domains of CREB expressed as recombinant proteins fused to GST (24) to pull-down myc-tagged
CD44-ICD expressed in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2D,
CD44-ICD bound 2 contiguous domains of CREB: Q2 (aa 160–
283), the constitutive glutamine-rich activation domain, and
bZIP (aa 284–341), the DNA binding/dimerization domain.
CD44-ICD did not bind the isolated DbZIP construct (aa 1–283)
of CREB that contains Q2 but not bZIP. It is possible that, in the
absence of bZIP, the presence of the amino-terminal part of the
protein interferes with the interaction between Q2 and CD44ICD. The fact that CD44-ICD binds to a CREB domain different
to that binding to p300 (KID domain; ref. 29) is consistent with
the possibility that a complex of 3 proteins, CREB, p300, and
CD44-ICD is formed.
CD44-ICD reduces the rate of CREB dephosphorylation
Various serine/threonine kinases, that is, PKA, RSK, and
MSK, are able to phosphorylate CREB on S133 and to stimulate
CREB binding to DNA (29, 35, 36). We evaluated the effects of
the blockage of these kinases. To inhibit PKA, we either treated
cells for 2 hours with the H89 compound, a potent selective

inhibitor of PKA, or transfected cells with a plasmid encoding
the PKA-speciﬁc peptide inhibitor (PKi; ref. 37). RSK and MSK
are activated by MEK (mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase;
ref. 36); thus, to inhibit RSK and MSK, we treated cells for 2
hours with the MEK inhibitor U0126. Nuclear extracts were
analyzed by Western blot with anti-pS133 CREB and normalized with anti-CREB. The inhibition of both PKA and MEK
efﬁciently blocked CD44-ICD–induced CREB phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
These results prompted us to hypothesize that, in the
presence of CD44-ICD, the increase of CREB phosphorylation
levels occurs because of a reduced rate of CREB dephosphorylation, rather than to activation of a speciﬁc CREB kinase. To
evaluate this possibility, we stimulated serum-starved
HEK293T cells for 40 minutes with the cAMP-analog N6benzoyl-cAMP to induce S133 CREB phosphorylation, and
then measured CREB binding to CD44-ICD. GST-CD44-ICD
pulled down a larger amount of CREB upon induction of CREB
phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), indicating that CD44-ICD, although
able to bind dephosphorylated CREB, binds preferentially to
pS133 CREB.
Then, we induced CREB phosphorylation with N6-benzoylcAMP in the presence or not of GFP-tagged CD44-ICD and
chased pS133 CREB dephosphorylation by immunoblot. Figure
3B shows that the pS133 CREB half-life was increased by CD44ICD; CREB pS133 levels did not decrease up to 12 hours in cells

Figure 3. A, HEK293T were treated for 1 hour with N6-benzoyl-cAMP (100 mmol/L). Protein lysates (2 mg) were pulled down with GST-CD44-ICD (ICD-GST) and
analyzed by immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. Normalization was obtained by CREB blotting, and CREB phosphorylation was determined by
phosphoCREB. B, GFP-tagged CD44-ICD (ICD-GFP)–transfected HEK293T cells, or cells transfected with the empty vector (), were treated with N6benzoyl-cAMP (100 mmol/L) and harvested at different time points. CREB and ATF-1 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblot. Anti-GFP and antiCREB were used for normalization. C, PKA-phosphorylated recombinant HIS-tagged CREB (0.05 mg) was incubated with 10 mU of PP2A catalytic subunit for
1 hour at 37 C. Where indicated, GST-CD44-ICD (ICD-GST), or the control GST, was added. CREB phosphorylation was detected with an antibody reacting
with phospho(Ser/Thr) PKA substrates. Normalization was done with anti-HIS. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

expressing CD44-ICD, whereas the half-life of pS133 CREB was
about 8 hours in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3B).
Finally, we carried out an in vitro CREB dephosphorylation
assay. Recombinant HIS-tagged CREB was phosphorylated in
vitro by PKA and then incubated with PP2A phosphatase in the
presence or the absence of GST-CD44-ICD. As shown in Fig. 3C,
GST-CD44-ICD, but not the GST backbone, protected phosphoCREB from PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation.
These ﬁndings showed that CD44-ICD reduces the rate of
CREB dephosphorylation on S133.
Expression of CD44-ICD-CREB complex in human
thyroid carcinoma cell lines
We selected thyroid cancer cells as a model whereby to study
effects of CD44-ICD. Initially, we looked for CD44-ICD, in 2 PTC
cell lines, TPC-1 and BCPAP, that feature the RET/PTC1
rearrangement and the BRAFV600E mutation, respectively; as
a control, we used P5, a normal thyroid primary cell culture.
Both PTC cell lines, but not nontransformed thyrocytes,
expressed full-length CD44 as well as CD44-ICD (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, pS133 CREB as well as phosphoATF-1
levels were detected in BCPAP and TPC-1, whereas they were
only barely detectable in P5 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
GST-CD44-ICD, but not the GST backbone, was able to pull
down pS133CREB and phosphoATF-1 in both BCPAP and TPC1 cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. S2B, left). Finally, in thyroid
cancer cells, the pCREB-CD44-ICD interaction was shown by
immunoprecipitating pS133-phosphorylated CREB and staining the blot with anti-CD44cyto antibody (Supplementary
Fig. S2B, right).
These ﬁndings showed that thyroid cancer cells express
CD44-ICD and that, in these cells, CD44-ICD exists in a
complex with CREB.
RET/PTC and BRAFV600E oncogenes induce CD44
cleavage
We treated TPC-1 and BCPAP cells for 48 hours with BB94,
a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor; moreover, we
treated the RET/PTC1-positive TPC-1 cell line with ZD6474,
a RET kinase inhibitor, and the BRAFV600E-positive BCPAP
cell line with U0126, a MEK inhibitor. EctoCD44 (sCD44st,
soluble standard CD44) shedding into the cell culture media
was measured by ELISA. EctoCD44 release was detected in
TPC-1 and BCPAP conditioned media (Supplementary Fig.
S3A, left); treatment with BB94, ZD6474, or U0126 blocked
ectoCD44 shedding (P < 0.01), indicating that RET and BRAF
signaling stimulates CD44 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S3A,
left). In TPC-1 cells, treatment with BB94, ZD6474, and
UO126 downregulated CD44-ICD (Supplementary Fig. S3A,
middle). CD44 downregulation by siRNA proved that the
protein band with a relative molecular weight of about 10
kDa was indeed CD44-ICD (Supplementary Fig. S3A, right).
Finally, g-secretase blockade by COMP X or DAPT decreased
the amount of CD44-ICD, whereas it increased the amount
of a polypeptide of approximately 31 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular weight of CD44-CTF (Supplementary Fig. S3A, middle). This effect was consistent with a block
of transmembrane conversion of CD44-CTF to CD44-ICD. In

contrast, CD44-CTF did not accumulate upon RET/PTC1 or
MEK inhibition, which suggests that the RET/PTC1 and
MEK block acts upstream CD44-CTF generation, possibly
at the level of metalloprotease-mediated CD44 cleavage
(Supplementary Fig. S3A, middle).
We coexpressed a GFP-tagged full-length CD44 with the 2
most prevalent RET/PTC oncogenes, RET/PTC1 and RET/
PTC3. RET/PTC oncogenes stimulated the generation of
CD44-ICD and CD44-CTF (Supplementary Fig. S3B). That the
band migrating above CD44-ICD corresponded to CD44-CTF
was suggested by the fact that when we used the metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 in cells coexpressing CD44-GFP and RET/
PTC1, this band was strongly reduced (Supplementary Fig.
S4A). Instead, when we used a CD44 mutant lacking g-secretase cleavage site (D287–290), this band was not affected
whereas CD44-ICD band was strongly attenuated (Supplementary Fig. S4B). RET/PTC-mediated CD44 cleavage depended on
RET/PTC kinase activity and on the integrity of tyrosine 1062,
because CD44-ICD did not accumulate when kinase-dead (K)
and (Y1062F) RET/PTC1 mutants were expressed (Supplementary Fig. S3C, left). CD44-ICD did not accumulate when the

when Y1062 was added back (3YF; Supplementary Fig. S3C,
right). We treated RET/PTC1-transfected HEK293T cells with
U0126. Treatment with U0126 blocked CD44-ICD generation
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Transient expression of the myctagged constitutively active forms of RAS (RASV12) and BRAF
(BRAFV600E) induced CD44-ICD formation (Supplementary
Fig. S3D), which further supports the concept that the ERK
pathway plays an important role in CD44 cleavage. Accordingly, also human thyroid carcinoma cell lines featuring
mutant RAS alleles upregulated both CD44 and CD44-ICD
with respect to nontransformed thyrocytes (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
These ﬁndings showed that RET/PTC and BRAF signaling to
ERK stimulates CD44 processing.
CD44-ICD sustains CREB phosphorylation and CCND1
expression in thyroid cancer cells
In BCPAP and TPC1 thyroid cancer cells, CD44 silencing
by shCD44, but not the empty vector, attenuated CREB
phosphorylation on S133 (Fig. 4A). In shCD44-transfected
cells, CREB phosphorylation was rescued by the transfection
of a V5-tagged rat CD44-ICD mRNA that is shCD44 resistant
because it has several mismatches with human shCD44 (Fig.
4A). BB94 and DAPT, able to block CD44 cleavage, reduced
CREB pS133 (Fig. 4B). Downregulation of either CREB or
CD44 by siRNA, but not a scrambled control, reduced (about
2-fold) the expression of CCND1 in BCPAP and TPC-1 cell
lines (Fig. 4C).
These ﬁndings showed that CD44-ICD sustains CREBdependent CCND1 expression in thyroid cancer cells.

CD44-ICD sustains proliferation of thyroid cells
We silenced CD44 by transiently transfecting BCPAP and
TPC-1 cells with a human shCD44 plasmid. To exclude offtarget effects, cells were cotransfected with the shCD44-resistant rat CD44-ICD construct. CD44 silencing reduced BrdUrd
incorporation (P < 0.05), and this effect was rescued by
adoptive expression of rat CD44-ICD (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A).
CD44-ICD was not able to rescue the reduction of BrdUrd
incorporation mediated by CREB silencing (P > 0.05) that is
consistent with CREB acting downstream CD44-ICD (Fig. 5A).
We treated BCPAP cells with the g-secretase inhibitor COMP X
and, to rescue the effect, we transfected CD44-ICD or the empty
vector. As shown in Fig. 5B, COMP X inhibited DNA synthesis in
BCPAP, and CD44-ICD was able to revert this effect. We stably
expressed CD44-ICD in BCPAP and selected one mass population by G418 treatment. Although treatment with COMP X
reduced the growth rate of parental cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C, left),
it did not change signiﬁcantly (P > 0.05) the proliferation of
BCPAP-ICD cells (Fig. 5C, right).
Nontransformed thyroid PC cells require a mixture of 6
hormones (6H), including TSH, for proliferation (23). In
hormone-starved PC cells, transiently transfected CD44-ICD
stimulated CRE-mediated transcription (about 9-fold;
Fig. 6A; P < 0.01) and activated the CCND1 promoter (almost
4-fold; Fig. 6B; P < 0.01). CREB silencing, but not a scrambled
control, obstructed CD44-ICD–mediated activation of
CCND1 luciferase (Fig. 6B; P < 0.01).
A mass population of CD44-ICD–transfected PC cells (PC
ICD pool) showed increased (about 8-fold) CRE-reporter luciferase activity with respect to empty vector–transfected cells
(Fig. 6C; P < 0.01). Finally, we measured the rate of DNA
synthesis in the absence of TSH. BrdUrd incorporation in PC

signaling pathway (18, 19). Moreover, as in other cell types (42),
CD44 was expressed in prospectively identiﬁed thyroid cancer
stem cells that induce tumors when injected orthotopically
into mouse thyroid (43). Thus, it is feasible that CD44 plays a
role in thyroid cancer as well as in thyroid cancer stem cells.
Oncogenic RET point mutants induce CD44 cleavage (17).
Here, we show that CD44-ICD is expressed in thyroid cancer
cell lines harboring RET/PTC or BRAFV600E oncogenes and
that RET/PTC and BRAF trigger CD44 cleavage. CD44-ICD is
necessary for the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells and
sufﬁcient to trigger proliferation of nontransformed thyrocytes. These effects are mediated by CREB and by increased
rate of CCND1 transcription. The fact that extracellular shedding of ectoCD44 accompanies the generation of CD44-ICD
and that RET and BRAF blockade impairs CD44-CTF accumulation indicates that metalloprotease-mediated cleavage is
one level at which CD44-ICD generation is stimulated in cells
expressing RET/PTC and BRAF. Accordingly, RET/PTC and
BRAF upregulate the transcription of several metalloproteases
(44). CD44 cleavage can be triggered by binding to different
extracellular ligands, including low molecular weight hyaluronan acid (45). RET, RAS, and BRAF oncogenes stimulate the
expression of osteopontin, one extracellular CD44 ligand;
whether this facilitates CD44 cleavage remains to be
determined.
Our ﬁndings support a model whereby CD44 cleavage acts as
an ampliﬁer of oncogenes signaling to CREB (Fig. 7). According
to this model, RET/PTC and BRAF promote CREB phosphorylation via ERK-mediated activation of CREB kinases and
stabilize pS133-CREB through CD44-ICD. In turn, the CD44ICD-CREB axis stimulates CCND1 transcription and thyroid
cell proliferation. Should these results be validated in vivo, they

ICD cells was higher (about 10-fold) than in empty vector–
transfected cells (Fig. 6D; P < 0.01). Thus, CD44-ICD is sufﬁcient
to trigger proliferation of nontransformed thyrocytes.

Discussion
Here we report a novel functional link between CD44 and the
CREB transcription factor. CREB is involved in neoplastic
transformation and, being activated via PKA by cAMP, is also
involved in the growth of normal thyroid follicular cells (38–
41). Our data show that CD44-ICD binds CREB and increases
pS133 CREB levels. CD44-ICD stimulated CREB-mediated gene
transcription and recruitment of CREB to CCND1 gene promoter. We noted that CD44-ICD preferentially binds to phosphorylated CREB and that CD44-ICD expression attenuates the
rate of CREB dephosphorylation, thus suggesting that interaction with CD44-ICD impairs CREB dephosphorylation on
S133. Accordingly, CD44-ICD protected pCREB from PP2Amediated dephosphorylation in vitro.
Thyroid carcinoma overexpresses CD44 and such overexpression is associated to the oncogenic conversion of the ERK
