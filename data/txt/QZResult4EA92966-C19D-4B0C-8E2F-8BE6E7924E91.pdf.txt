Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The BRAF kinase is mutated, typically V600E, to induce an active oncogenic state in a large
fraction of melanoma, thyroid, hairy cell leukemia, and to a lesser extent, a wide spectrum of other
cancers1,2. BRAFV600E phosphorylates and activates the kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn
phosphorylate and activate the kinases ERK1 and ERK2, stimulating the MAPK pathway to
promote cancer3. Targeting MEK1/2 is proving to be an important therapeutic strategy, as a
MEK1/2 inhibitor provides a survival advantage in metastatic melanoma4, which is increased
when co-administered with a BRAFV600E inhibitor5. In this regard, we previously found that
copper (Cu) influx enhances MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through a Cu-MEK1 interaction6.
We now show that genetic loss of the high affinity Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in MEK1 that
disrupt Cu binding reduced BRAFV600E-driven signaling and tumorigenesis. Conversely, a
MEK1-MEK5 chimera that phosphorylates ERK1/2 independent of Cu or an active ERK2
restored tumor growth to cells lacking Ctr1. Importantly, Cu chelators used in the treatment of
Wilson disease7 reduced tumor growth of both BRAFV600E-transformed cells and cells resistant to
BRAF inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that Cu-chelation therapy could be
repurposed to treat BRAFV600E mutation-positive cancers.

Reducing Ctr1 expression suppresses MAPK phenotypes in Drosophila and signaling in
mammalian cells. In a cupric setting MEK1 also binds Cu and Cu chelation reduces
MEK1/2 kinase activity6. Cu and to a lesser extent silver, which is isoelectric to cuprous Cu,
increased MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK2, whereas other metals had no effect (Extended
Data Fig. 1a). Given these results and the dependency of BRAF mutation-positive cancers on
MEK1/28, we investigated whether reducing Cu influx affects BRAFV600E-driven
tumorigenesis. BRAFV600E was expressed in immortalized Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)9 and intracellular Cu deficiency of the latter confirmed by
increased CCS levels10 (Fig. 1a,b). The BRAFV600E-transformed Ctr1-/- MEFs exhibited
reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2), cell growth, and tumor kinetics, effects
rescued by expressing CTR1, but not the transport-defective mutant11 CTR1M154A (Fig. 1ad and Extended Data Figs. 2a-c, 10a,b). Thus, BRAFV600E requires the Cu-transport
function of CTR1 for robust signaling and tumorigenesis.

To assess whether reducing Cu binding in MEK1 affects BRAFV600E-driven tumorigenesis,
targeted mutagenesis revealed that M187A, H188A, M230A, and H239A as well as one
other mutation reduced the ability of MEK1 to bind a Cu-charged resin and phosphorylate
ERK1/2 (Extended Data Fig. 3a-c). Metal catalyzed oxidation reaction (MCO) followed by
mass spectrometry identified oxidation at H188, M230A, H239, as well as two other sites
(Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 4), suggesting that these residues reside within 10 Å of a Cu
atom12. We thus focused on H188, M230, H239, as well as M187, as although the oxidation
status of M187 could not be determined, it lies adjacent to H188 and is similarly required for
Cu-binding and kinase activity (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Figs. 3c, 4e). These four amino
acids are conserved in MEK2 (Extended Data Fig. 5), which like MEK1, also bound a Cucharged resin and was inhibited by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), a Cu chelator (Extended Data
Fig. 1b,c). In the three-dimensional MEK1 structure13, these four amino acids also cluster
such that each is no more than 12.5 Å from the next (Fig. 1e). Combined mutations at these
sites progressively reduced MEK1 kinase activity and affinity for Cu, with mutations at all
four sites (copper-binding mutant) having the largest defect in kinase activity, even in the
presence of a constitutively-active (DD)14 mutation or excess Cu (Fig. 1f-j). Nevertheless,
MEK1CBM was still phosphorylated in BRAFV600E-transformed cells and underwent
cooperative unfolding and possessed similar thermostability relative to MEK1, as assessed
by both circular dichroism and differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 1k,l and Extended
Data Figs. 6a-d, 10c). To rule out that the CBM mutation reduced kinase activity
independent of Cu binding, we took advantage of the fact that MEK5 is highly homologous
to MEK1/2, yet lacks two sites important for Cu binding (Extended Data Fig. 5) and neither
bound the Cu-charged resin nor exhibited changes in kinase activity in the presence of Cu or
TTM (Fig. 1m,n). Specifically, introducing a CBMEquivalent mutation into MEK5 was
found to have no overt effect on the ability of MEK5 to phosphorylate substrates MBP or
ERK5 in vitro or in cells (Fig. 1o,p). Given these results, we tested and found that the
reduction in P-ERK1/2 and tumor growth of BRAFV600E-transformed, immortalized
Ctr1+/+ MEFs upon knockdown of endogenous Mek1 mRNA by shRNA (Fig. 1k) was
rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant MEK1, but not MEK1CBM (Fig. 1l,q and Extended
Data Fig. 10c). Thus, under normal Cu homeostasis, inhibiting Cu binding in MEK1 retards
BRAFV600E-driven signaling and tumorigenesis.

We next tested whether bypassing the requirement of MEK1/2 for Cu restores BRAFV600Edriven signaling and tumorigenesis to Ctr1-/- MEFs. MEK1 was engineered to be
independent of Cu by fusing the ERK1/2-binding region of MEK115 to the kinase domain of
MEK5, rendered active (DD mutation)16 as MEK5 is a substrate of the MAPKKK, MEKK2
and MEKK317. Expressing MEK1-MEK5DD resulted in high levels of P-ERK1/2 in
immortalized Ctr1-/- MEFs (Fig 1r,s), in contrast to similarly activated MEK1DD, which
remained sensitive to TTM (Fig. 1j). Furthermore, MEK1-MEK5DD restored tumor growth
to these Ctr1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1t and Extended Data Fig. 10d). Similarly, expressing
ERK2R67S, which increases ERK2 autophosphorylation in a MEK1/2-independent
fashion18, ERK2D321N, which renders the kinase insensitive to phosphatases19, or
ERK2GOF, which combines these two mutations, also led to robust ERK1/2 phosphorylation
and restored tumor growth to the Ctr1-/- MEFs (Fig. 1u-w and Extended Data Fig. 10d).
Thus, while reducing Cu levels will certainly have pleiotropic effects20 that could affect
MAPK signaling21, activating the MAPK pathway in a fashion independent of Cu
nevertheless restores MAPK signaling and tumorigenesis in cells deficient in Cu influx.

To investigate the relationship between Cu and endogenous oncogenic BRAF in
tumorigenesis, CTR1 was stably knocked down by shRNA in BRAF mutation-positive and
mutation-negative melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of CTR1 reduced P-ERK1/2 levels in
all tested cell lines, although only the BRAF mutation-positive cell lines exhibited reduced
tumor growth (Fig. 2a-c and Extended Data Fig. 10b), consistent with a dependency of
BRAFV600E-tumorigenicity on MEK1/28. Knockdown of CTR1 also inhibited the tumor
growth of one of two tested NRAS mutation-positive melanoma cell lines (Extended Data
Fig. 7a,b). Finally, loss of Ctr1 had no effect on the ability of a different oncogene,
CMYCT58A, to promote tumor growth (Fig. 2d,e). These results suggest a specific
requirement for Cu in cancers particularly dependent upon the MAPK pathway.

We next evaluated the requirement for Cu influx in vivo during spontaneous cancer
development. Mice harboring floxed conditional null or wild-type Ctr1 alleles22 were
crossed into a BrafCA/+;Trp53flox/flox (BP)23 background, which upon intranasal
administration of adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) converts BrafCA to an
oncogenic BrafV600E allele and Trp53flox to a null allele, leading to the development of lung
adenocarcinomas23. Cohorts of Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1flox/flox BP mice were administered AdCre
to induce cancer development, and in the latter case, to convert Ctr1flox/flox to null alleles.
Tumors arising in both cohorts exhibited the appropriate recombination of the BrafCA,
Trp53flox, and Ctr1flox alleles and targeted loss of Ctr1 did not result in a weight loss
(Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Ctr1flox/flox BP mice exhibited a decrease in the number of visible
surface lesions, area of abnormal lung tissue, and P-ERK1/2 staining in tumors as well as a
15% survival advantage over Ctr1+/+ BP mice (Fig. 3a-g and Extended Data Fig. 10a,b).
Thus, the loss of Ctr1 retards BRAFV600E-driven tumorigenesis, leading to a survival
advantage.
Cu chelators D-penicillamine, trientine, and TTM are efficacious, long-term treatments for
lowering systemic Cu levels in individuals with the Cu-overload disorder Wilson disease7.
Capitalizing on these drugs, we tested and found that TTM reduced soft agar growth
BRAFV600E-transformed, immortalized MEFs, but not the MEFs expressing ERK2GOF,

MEK1-MEK5DD, or CMYCT58A. Soft agar growth of BRAF mutation-positive melanoma
cell lines was also inhibited by TTM to varying degrees in a dose-dependent manner, while
BRAF/NRAS mutation-negative lines were resistant to TTM (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig.
10e). Oral TTM treatments for only two weeks also reduced the size of tumors in mice
injected with either BRAFV600E-transformed, immortalized MEFs or the BRAF mutationpositive melanoma cell line DM440, with no negative effect on mouse weight (Fig. 4b,c and
Extended Data Figs. 9, 10e). This could be ascribed to a reduction in MEK1/2 kinase
activity, as TTM halved the number of P-ERK1/2-positive cells in BRAFV600E-driven
tumors and failed to inhibit tumor growth of ERK2GOF-transformed cells (Fig. 4d,e). To
investigate more aggressive Cu-reducing therapeutic modalities, mice injected with
BRAFV600E-transformed, immortalized MEFs were provided a Cu-deficient (CuD) diet
supplemented with Cu and orally treated with vehicle alone for two weeks, or provided with
a CuD diet and treated for two weeks with vehicle alone, oral TTM, or oral TTM followed
by oral trientine (Fig. 4f). Tumors in mice fed a CuD diet trended towards being smaller,
although this did not reach significance (P=0.055). Combining this diet with TTM blocked
the development of visible tumors during the two weeks of treatment, although tumors
quickly emerged after treatment ceased. However, mice treated with oral trientine after TTM
exhibited a more durable response (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 10e). Thus, Cu-reducing
strategies used to manage Wilson disease7 could be repurposed for the treatment of
BRAFV600E-driven cancers.

BRAFV600E inhibitors such as vemurafenib have a limited duration of response due to
acquired resistance often associated with reactivation of MEK1/224. One reported
mechanism of resistance is acquisition of an activating C121S mutation in MEK125.
Interestingly, although MEK1C121S had elevated kinase activity in vitro, it still bound to the
Cu-charged resin and its kinase activity was still inhibited by TTM (Fig. 4h,i). Moreover,
although expressing MEK1C121S in the BRAF mutation-positive melanoma cell line A375
increased P-ERK1/2 levels and imparted resistance to vemurafenib compared to the same
cells expressing MEK1, the MEK1C121S-expressing A375 cells nevertheless still remained
sensitive to TTM in vivo (Fig. 4j-l and Extended Data Fig. 10f). Thus, Cu chelation reduces
tumorigenicity driven by a mutation that confers resistance to a BRAFV600E inhibitor.

Author Manuscript

While the detailed mechanism underlying the requirement of Cu for robust MEK1/2 kinase
activity remains to be elucidated, we show that decreasing Cu influx, Cu bioavailability, and
binding of Cu to MEK1 reduced MEK1(2) kinase activity and oncogenic BRAF-driven
tumorigenesis. Cu chelators, which are safe and economical drugs dosed daily for upwards
of decades to manage Cu levels in Wilson disease patients7, also reduced oncogenic BRAFand MEK1-driven tumorigenesis. As such, inhibiting MEK1/2 kinase activity with Cu
chelators, perhaps in combination with other MAPK inhibitors, may merit clinical
consideration for the treatment of not only BRAF mutation-positive cancers, but cancers
developing resistance to BRAFV600E and potentially even MEK inhibitors.

150 mM NaCl containing 40 μM GST-MEK1, 100 mM ascorbate and 1 mM H2O2.
Untreated MEK1 was included as the control. The reactions were stopped by precipitating
the proteins in methanol/chloroform followed by reduction with 2.5 mM DTT at 37 °C for
30 minutes and alkylation with 20 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 30
minutes38,39. In-solution digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (1:40
enzyme:protein ratio; modified, sequencing grade, Promega), which hydrolyzes peptide
bonds at the carboxyl end of lysine and arginine, or chymotrypsin (1:60 enzyme:protein
ratio, Sigma), which hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the carboxyl end of aromatic or large
hydrophobic side chains of tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine and leucine. The
digested peptide samples were desalted with stage tips40 and lyophilized with a SpeedVac.
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed
on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with a
Finnigan Nanospray II electrospray ionization source. Digested peptides were injected onto
a 75 μm × 150 mm BEH C18 column (particle size 1.7 μm, Waters) and separated using a
Waters nanoACQUITY Ultra Performance LC™ (UPLC™) System (Waters). The LTQ
Orbitrap XL was operated in the data-dependent mode using the TOP10 strategy as
previously described41. In brief, each scan cycle was initiated with a full MS scan of high
mass accuracy [375–1,800 m/z; acquired in the Orbitrap XL at 6 × 104 resolution setting and
automatic gain control (AGC) target of 106], which was followed by MS/MS scans (AGC
target 5,000; threshold 3,000) in the linear ion trap on the 10 most abundant precursor ions.
Selected ions were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds. Singly charged ions were excluded
from MS/MS analysis. MS/MS spectra were searched by using the SEQUEST algorithm
against the human MEK1 sequence. Search parameters allowed for two missed tryptic
cleavages, a mass tolerance of ± 80 ppm, a static modification of 57.02146 Daltons
(carboxyamidomethylation) on cysteine, and dynamic modifications of 15.99491 Dalton
(oxidation) on methionine or histidine. The MS/MS spectra of matched peptides were
validated manually. Modeling of the distance between the thiol groups of methionines or
imidazole groups of histidines was performed using the three-dimensional structure of
MEK1 in complex with magnesium and ATP-γS determined at 2.1 Å (PDB ID: 3EQD)13.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy

Author Manuscript

Circular dichroism data were collected on a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer with a JASCO
Peltier device and water bath to control the temperature. Experiments were performed in a 1mm cuvette at a protein concentration of 5 μM in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl.
Far UV scans were collected from 200 nm to 250 nm. Thermal denaturation of MEK1 and
MEK1CBM proteins monitored at a 222 nm to estimate the protein melting temperature. The
temperature ramp rate was 1 °C/minute and data points were collected every 1 °C. All data
are reported in units of mean residue ellipticity, which was calculated as follows:
, where θraw is the ellipticity in degrees, MRW is
, c is the protein concentration in g/ml, and l is the pathlength of the
cuvette in cm, as previously described26.

Differential scanning fluorimetry

Author Manuscript

Differential scanning fluorimetry data were collected on a CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time
PCR Dectection System (Bio-Rad) at a protein concentration of 1.3 μM in 25 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT using SYPRO orange as previously described27.
The Tm was calculated by determining the maximum of the first derivative curve of
normalized data in Prism 5 (GraphPad) as previously described27.
Mouse xenografts, drug treatments, and diet alteration

Author Manuscript

5 × 106 MEFs or 107 melanoma cells resuspended in phosphate buffer saline were injected
subcutaneously into flanks of SCID/beige mice (Charles River Laboratory) as previously
described42. Drug treatments were as follows: vehicle [1% methylcellulose (Sigma), 1%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma)], 2.0 mg tetrathiomolybdate (TTM, Sigma) in vehicle,
or 20 mg/kg vemurafenib (Chemietek) in vehicle every other day (q.o.d) via oral gavage.
Mice were fed a normal diet (PMI 5053 Picolab Mouse Diet 20, LabDiet) or where
indicated, a Cu-deficient diet (CuD diet, TD.80388, Harlan Teklad). Mice fed a CuD diet
mice were administered deionized H2O (diH2O) supplemented with 20 mg/L CuSO4, diH2O
alone, or diH2O supplemented with 3 g/L trientine dihydrocholoride (Sigma). All studies
were approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analysis of tumor volumes at end point was performed using a one-tailed,
unpaired T-test, with a 95% confidence interval for two group datasets or one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with a 95%, 99%, or 99.9% confidence interval and Tukey’s multiple
comparison post test for ≥ 3 datasets in Prism 5 (GraphPad). Statistical analysis of
percentage of mice with tumors ≥ 1.0 cm3 versus time (days) was analyzed using a survival
curve log-rank (mantel-cox) test in Prism5 (GraphPad).

Analysis of lung tumors

Ctr1flox/flox mice22 were interbred with BrafCA/+; Trp53flox/flox (BP) mice23, a generous gift
of D.G. Kirsch (Duke University), for three generations to generate BrafCA/+; Trp53flox/flox;
Ctr1+/+ and BrafCA/+; Trp53flox/flox; Ctr1flox/flox mice. PCR was performed to detect wildtype, conditional, and recombined alleles of Braf, Ctr1, and Trp53, as previously
described22,23. Cohorts of these animals were administered 6 × 106 pfu adenoviral Cre
(University of Iowa) intranasally between 69 and 85 days of age. Mice were then monitored
and euthanized three months later or at moribundity endpoints. All studies were approved by
the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical analysis of
percent survival versus time (days) was conducted using a survival curve log-rank (mantelcox) test in Prism 5 (GraphPad).

To quantitate the number of visible surface tumors per mouse, lungs were resected from five
Ctr1+/+ and five Ctr1flox/flox BP mice 3 months after Ad-Cre treatment and the number of
tumors visible on the surface of lungs were counted. Statistical analysis of the average
number of tumors per mouse was performed using a one-tailed, unpaired T-test, with a 95%
confidence interval for two group datasets. To quantitate the percent of abnormal lung
tissue, lungs were resected from five Ctr1+/+ and five Ctr1flox/flox BP mice 3 months after

Ad-Cre treatment, fixed in 10% formalin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to epitope retrieval before staining with
Hematoxylin (Surgipath) and Eosin (Fisher Scientific). Photographs were taken at low
power on an Olympus Vanox S microscope to encompass the entire lung, images were
blinded, and then the abnormal areas of adenoma and adenocarcinoma from each
micrograph were circumscribed using Adobe Photoshop and the abnormal area in pixels was
expressed as a percentage of the total lung area from all micrographs. Statistical analysis of
the average percent of abnormal tissue per mouse was performed using a one-tailed,
unpaired T-test, with a 95% confidence interval for two group datasets.

Three xenograft tumors from mice injected with BRAFV600E-transformed and SV40immortalized Ctr1+/+ MEFs or lungs resected at moribundity endpoint from Ctr1+/+ and
Ctr1flox/flox BP mice treated with Ad-Cre were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin
embedded. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to epitope retrieval and
stained with an anti-P-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell Signaling), followed by
peroxidase-based detection with Vectastain Elite ABC Kits (Vector Labs) and
counterstaining with Hematoxylin. Photographs were taken of high-power fields of highest
positivity (P-ERK IHC) on an Olympus Vanox S microscope. Images were blinded and
tumors were circumscribed in P-ERK1/2-stained tissue images using the freehand selection
tool in Image J, and the total area of the tumor in pixels was recorded. Tumor images were
copied and pasted to new, blank images and color thresholding was applied to determine
positive-staining areas using the same parameters for each tumor image. Areas staining
positive by these parameters were selected and the positive-staining area in pixels was
recorded. Percent positive-staining area was calculated by dividing the positive-staining area
of the tumor in pixels by the total area of the tumor in pixels. Statistical significance was
determined using unpaired, one-tailed t-tests between treated and untreated, or between
Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1flox/flox cohorts using Prism 5 (GraphPad).
Cell growth and soft agar assays

Author Manuscript

For growth curve experiments, cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells/well in six
replicate wells in four 24-well plates. At days 0, 1, 2, and 3 one plate was fixed for five
minutes in formalin, washed with PBS and stained for 30 minutes with 0.1% crystal violet
(Sigma) and allowed to dry for at least 24 hours. Stain was extracted in 200 μl of 10% acetic
acid in each well, transferred to 96-well plate, and absorbance at 600 nm was measured
using a GloMax Multi Detection System plate reader (Promega). Relative growth was
determined by normalization to the signal at day 0 and plotted in Prism 5 (GraphPad).
Anchorage-independent growth was assayed in 6-well plates with 1 ml of 0.6% bactoagar
media solution (final concentration 1x DMEM, 10% FBS, 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin) as a
bottom support layer. 5 × 104 cells per well were resuspended in DMEM (10% FBS, 1x
Penicillin/Streptomycin) and mixed 1:1 with 0.6% bactoagar media solution with an
appropriate concentration of DMSO or TTM to give a final bactoagar concentration of 0.3%,
100 nM TTM, 400 nM of TTM, or an equivalent amount of DMSO and plated in triplicate.
Each well was fed on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 with 300 μl of DMEM with the appropriate
concentration of DMSO or TTM. Colonies were counted between days 21 and 28. Statistical
