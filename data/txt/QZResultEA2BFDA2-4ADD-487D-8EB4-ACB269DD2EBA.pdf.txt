relevant editing events, many of which are in noncoding regions. We experimentally demonstrated
the effects of several cross-tumor nonsynonymous RNA editing events on cell viability and
provide the evidence that RNA editing could selectively affect drug sensitivity. These results

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism that confers specific and
reproducible nucleotide changes in selected RNA transcripts (Bass, 2002; Keegan et al.,
2001). As for functional consequences, RNA editing events can result in missense codon
changes (Maas and Rich, 2000), modulation of alternative splicing (Rueter et al., 1999), or
modification of regulatory RNAs (Kawahara et al., 2007; Tomaselli et al., 2015) and their
binding sites (Liang and Landweber, 2007). In humans, the most common type of RNA
editing is adenosine to inosine (A to I)(Piskol et al., 2013), which is catalyzed by ADAR
enzymes (Bass et al., 1997). Despite some issues in earlier attempts, recently several groups
have developed computational methods for accurately detecting A-to-I RNA editing from
next-generation sequencing data on a large scale (Bahn et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2012;
Ramaswami et al., 2012; Ramaswami et al., 2013). As a result, more than a million A-to-I
RNA editing sites have been confidently detected in the human genome (Bazak et al., 2014;
Ramaswami et al., 2013). However, the vast majority of these sites are in noncoding and
repetitive element regions of the genome and have unknown functional relevance.
Therefore, the research focus on RNA editing has moved from identification of novel sites
to characterization of the mechanisms by which they mediate their functions and their
consequences on cellular function.
To date, a critical role of A-to-I RNA editing in human cancer has been reported for only
individual examples. In prostate cancer, A-to-I RNA editing in the androgen receptor

impairs the protein's ability to interact with androgenic or anti-androgenic ligands (Martinez
et al., 2008); in liver cancer, the edited form of AZIN1 has a stronger affinity for antizyme
and induces cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of AZIN1, and a low editing level is
sufficient to confer more aggressive tumor behavior (Chen et al., 2013); in colorectal cancer,
A-to-I RNA editing in RHOQ promotes the invasion potential (Han et al., 2014); and in
gliboblastoma, ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in CDC14B modulates the Skp2/p21/p27
pathway and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease (Galeano et al., 2013).
Despite these intriguing findings, the global pattern of A-to-I RNA editing in human cancer
genomes have not been systematically characterized, and the functional importance and
clinical relevance of RNA editing in cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we aimed to
address these questions through a systematic analysis of A-to-I RNA editing events using
RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project (The Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013).

Results
Overview of A-to-I RNA editing patterns across major cancer types

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To perform a comprehensive, high-quality analysis of A-to-I RNA editing in cancer
genomes, we developed a computational pipeline based on ~1.4 million high-confidence
RNA editing sites annotated in the Rigorously Annotated Database of A-to-I RNA Editing
(RADAR) (Ramaswami and Li, 2014) (Figure S1A). The RNA editing sites in RADAR
were collected from recent transcriptome-wide RNA-editing identification studies and
underwent extensive manual curation. We further applied a series of filters to remove the
potential contamination of SNPs or somatic mutations (Experimental Procedures). Thus, this
RNA editing dataset represent a reliable and global candidate set to start with. From TCGA
RNA-seq data, we assessed the RNA-editing signals at these candidate sites in 6236 samples
of 17 cancer types or related normal tissues (Table 1 and Figure 1A). For each cancer type,
we detected a large number of RNA editing candidate sites with editing signals but many of
them were only sufficiently covered in a limited sample set. Therefore, we defined
“informative” RNA editing sites as those sites with detected signals and coverage ≥10× in
≥30 tumor samples (and related normal samples) for a cancer type (Experimental
Procedures) and focused on these sites in subsequent analyses to ensure adequate statistical
power. The number of informative RNA editing sites per cancer type ranged from 8493 in
CRC to 76555 in BRCA (Figure 1B). This large variation among cancer types is mainly
because (i) the number of tumor samples per cancer type varied markedly (from 66 in KICH
to 837 in BRCA, Table 1) and (ii) the number of mappable reads per sample varied greatly
among cancer types due to different sequencing strategies (from 22 million in CRC to 174
million in KICH, Table 1). Indeed, across the 17 cancer types, the number of informative
editing sites showed a strong linear correlation with the total number of mappable bases or
the total number of mappable reads (Figure 1B, Pearson Correlation R = 0.84, p = 2.0×10−5,
Spearman Correlation Rs = 0.75, p = 7.4×10−4; Figure S1B, R = 0.89, p = 2.0×10−6, Rs =
0.82, p = 7.0×10−5). These results also indicate that the informative editing sites we
identified show no significant bias towards one or a few well-studied cancer types.

We first quantified the editing levels at the informative RNA editing sites (defined as the
proportion of edited reads among the total mapped reads at a given site in a TCGA BAM
file). As a quality control, we randomly selected a few samples, remapped the raw RNA-seq
reads using the previously established mapping pipeline that can accurately detect both Alu
and non-Alu RNA editing events (Ramaswami et al., 2012; Ramaswami et al., 2013), and
obtained very consistent RNA-editing levels (Spearman correlation Rs > 0.93). Thus, for the
informative edited sites surveyed, the employed RNA-seq mapping procedures had little
effect on the quantification of RNA-editing levels. Figure 1C shows the overall editing-level
distributions at informative RNA editing sites in different cancer types (Figure S1C shows
the distributions in normal tissues). We next examined the distribution of these editing sites
in different types of transcribed regions (Figure 1D). Across different cancer types, most of
the informative RNA editing sites were in 3′ UTRs and intronic regions, as observed
previously in mouse tissues (Gu et al., 2012), but the editing sites in coding regions were
relatively limited (Figure S1D shows the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous
RNA editing sites in different cancer types). Furthermore, we did not detect any correlation
between RNA-editing level and the local GC content (Figure S1E). Since our analysis was
based on RNA-seq data, the observed genomic distribution of informative RNA editing sites
could be affected by the coverage bias of the mRNA-seq platform. However, due to the
large number of candidate editing sites examined, we still obtained sufficient sampling
power to survey RNA editing activities in different transcribed regions.
Diversity of RNA editing patterns in tumors relative to normal samples

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The global RNA-editing differences between cancer samples and related normal tissues
remain largely uncharacterized, and previous studies have suggested this is a complex topic
(Jiang et al., 2013; Maas et al., 2001; Nemlich et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2014; Tomaselli et al.,
2015). For example, an earlier study found reduced editing in brain tumors (Paz et al.,
2007); while a recent study suggests a mixture of gene-specific hyper- and hypo-editing
activities in liver cancer (Chan et al., 2014). However, these studies are either based on a
small set of RNA editing sites or limited to a single cancer type. To obtain a comprehensive
view of RNA editing patterns in tumor samples, we focused on 12 tumor types with
available RNA-seq data for matched normal tissues from the same patients (Figure 2A). For
each cancer type, we identified RNA editing sites with significantly differential editing
activity between matched tumor and normal samples (paired Wilcoxon test, false discovery
rate [FDR] < 0.05 and the mean editing-level difference among comparison groups, Diff ≥
5%). Although with this criterion the editing levels at the most sites remain similar, we
observed a great diversity of “altered” RNA editing patterns across these cancer types:
significant numbers of RNA editing sites showed over-editing patterns in HNSC, BRCA,
THCA and LUAD tumors, while significant numbers of editing sites showed under-editing
patterns in KICH and KIRP tumors.
To identify the molecular determinants underlying these patterns, we performed two
complementary analyses: one focusing on the general pattern across cancer types and the
other focusing the editing abundance within each cancer type. We first analyzed the
correlations of ADAR expression with the “net” proportion of over-editing RNA sites
(defined as the percentage of over-editing sites minus the percentage of under-editing sites)

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 October 12.

and found that the proportion was highly correlated with the relative ADAR1 mRNA
expression level (defined as the fold change relative to normal samples) (Spearman
correlation Rs = 0.70, p = 0.014, Figure 2B), but not with that of ADAR2 (Rs = 0.38, p =
0.22, Figure 2B) nor ADAR3 (Rs = −0.007, p = 0.99, Figure 2B). Figure 2C and 2D show the
detailed RNA-editing change patterns in two representative cancer types. In BRCA, 12770
(16.7%) informative RNA editing sites showed significant over-editing in the tumor samples
than matched normal samples; whereas only 553 (1.2%) showed significant under-editing in
tumor samples (paired Wilcoxon test, FDR < 0.05, Figure 2C, left panel). In contrast, in
KICH, only 110 (0.5%) informative RNA editing sites showed over-editing in the tumor
samples; whereas 4318 (19.3%) showed under-editing in tumor samples (paired Wilcoxon
test, FDR < 0.05, Figure 2D, left panel). Indeed, ADAR1 mRNA expression was much
higher in BRCA than in matched normal samples (fold change = 1.81, paired Wilcoxon test,
p < 2.2×10−16, Figure 2C, right panel); while ADAR1 was significantly under-expressed in
KICH (fold change = 0.76, paired Wilcoxon test, p = 1.6×10−4, Figure 2D, right panel). We
further performed sample-based analysis within each cancer type and found that the number
of informative sites with editing signals shows the strongest correlation with the ADAR1
mRNA expression among the three ADAR enzymes (Table S1). These results suggest that
the global altered RNA-editing patterns in tumors are more likely to be affected by ADAR1
than the other two editing enzymes. However, since the mRNA expression of ADAR may
not directly reflect enzyme editing activity (Wahlstedt et al., 2009) and the dimer formation
and the interactions among the ADAR enzymes could be important for editing activity
(Chen et al., 2000; Chilibeck et al., 2006; Cho et al., 2003), further efforts are required to
elucidate the relative contributions of the three ADAR enzymes to the observed RNA
editing patterns.

An appreciable level of clinically relevant RNA editing sites in various cancer types

Author Manuscript

Given the large number of A-to-I RNA editing events observed across tumor types and
distinct editing patterns at some sites between tumor and normal tissues, a fundamental
question is what fraction of RNA editing events in tumors are functionally tumorigenic or
clinically valuable. To address this question, we focused on the RNA editing sites showing
correlations with tumor subtype, clinical stage and patient survival. Clinical stage and
patient survival are well-established clinical variables, while tumor subtype often facilitates
clinical decisions. In a sense, they all characterize intertumoral heterogeneity among the
same disease. Thus, we referred to RNA editing sites showing non-random editing patterns
in regard to these biologically and clinically meaningful parameters as “clinically relevant
editing sites”. Specifically, we identified such sites within each cancer type using three
complementary computational analyses (Figure 3A): (i) differential analysis of RNA editing
level among established tumor subtypes (FDR < 0.01, Diff ≥ 5%), which identified 2660
RNA editing sites in total; (ii) differential analysis of RNA editing level among tumor stages
(FDR < 0.05, Diff ≥ 5%), which identified 684 RNA editing sites in total; and (iii)
correlation analysis of RNA editing level with patient overall survival (FDR < 0.05, Diff ≥
5%), which identified 1,130 RNA editing sites in total. Among the 17 cancer types, 12
cancers contained such clinically relevant sites, ranging from 4 in PRAD to 2059 in BRCA
(Table S2). To rule out the potential confounding effect of tumor purity, we repeated the
analysis using ABSOLUTE-based (Carter et al., 2012) tumor purity as a covariate. For the

nine cancer types with available tumor purity data, we found that 97.9% of the clinically
relevant sites originally identified still remain significant (Table S2). We also calculated the
correlation of ADAR expression levels with tumor purity and found no strong correlation
(Table S2). Therefore, tumor purity appeared to have little effect on our results.

Author Manuscript

In order to investigate the distributions of clinically relevant editing sites in different types
of RNA regions, we classified the RNA editing sites from three parallel perspectives: gene
annotation, sequence repetitive elements and evolutionary conservation. Since the power to
detect clinically relevant editing sites in our analysis was affected by sample size and quality
of clinical data (e.g., the follow-up time) in a given cancer type, we examined the
distribution patterns for each cancer type separately. Further, given the potential effects of
coverage bias in different RNA regions due to gene expression or the mRNA-seq platform,
instead of directly comparing the proportions of clinically relevant RNA editing sites among
different RNA regions, we performed a coverage-dependent permutation test to assess the
enrichment/depletion patterns (Experimental Procedures). In terms of gene annotation, we
found that clinically relevant RNA editing sites tend to be in noncoding RNAs as well as in
nonsynomous and intronic regions in some cancer types (Figure 3B). In terms of sequence
repetitive elements, clinically relevant sites show consistent depletion patterns in Alu
elements (Figure 3C). In terms of evolutionary conservation, clinically relevant sites tend to
be conserved among humans, chimpanzees and macaques (Figure 3D). Together, these
analyses based on different types of RNA-region classification help to understand which
factors affect the overall distributions of clinically relevant RNA editing sites.
“Driver” functional effects of clinically relevant nonsynonymous RNA editing events

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since clinically relevant RNA editing events at nonsynonymous sites could directly result in
amino acid changes, we focused on these RNA editing sites and assessed their functional
effects experimentally. To boost the discovery power, we performed the above analyses for
nonsynonymous RNA editing sites with a relaxed FDR cutoff and identified 35 RNA editing
sites with potential clinical relevance (FDR < 0.2, Diff > 5%, Table S3). Interestingly, 8 out
of these RNA editing events (22.9%) showed clinically relevant patterns in more than one
cancer type (Figure 4A, Figure S2). This pan-cancer analysis suggests that some A-to-I
nonsynonymous RNA editing may be a “master” driver event and play a critical functional
role in different tumor contexts. We focused on four top editing candidate sites (S367G in
AZIN1, I164V in COPA, I635V in COG3 and R764G in GRIA2) for further investigation
(Figure 4A and Figure S2B). The functional effects of RNA editing at the residue S367G in
AZIN1 (identified in eight cancer types by our analysis, Figure 4B and Figure S2C) have
been characterized in liver cancer (Chen et al., 2013). Differential editing activity at I164V
in COPA (identified in seven cancer types, Figure 4C and Figure S2D) between tumor and
normal samples has been reported in liver cancer (Chan et al., 2014) but has not been
functionally characterized. I635V at COG3 (identified in six cancer types, Figure 4D and
Figure S2E) was only reported in a recent RNA-editing methodology study (Ramaswami et
al., 2012). GRIA2 (also known as GluR-B) contains two known RNA editing sites: the
Q607R editing in the second transmembrane domain is well studied (Herb et al., 1996;
Higuchi et al., 1993) but has insufficient coverage in our dataset; the role of R764G
(identified in two cancer types, Figure 4E) has not been functionally characterized in cancer.

We confirmed the occurrence of these RNA editing events in an independent set of breast
tumor samples using an orthogonal Sequenom approach (Figure 5A and Figure S3A).

Author Manuscript

Given the availability of high-quality antibodies, we assessed the functional effects of the
editing events in AZIN1, GRIA2 and COG3 using various functional assays. To examine the
effects on cell proliferation or survival, we performed cell viability assays (upon
overexpression) in MCF10A cells, a normal human breast epithelial cell line. Given similar
levels of wild-type and edited proteins (Figure S3B), the edited AZIN1 (AZIN1S367G),
GRIA2 (GRIA2R764G) and COG3(COG3I635V) significantly increased cell survival relative
to the wild-type gene (t-test, p < 0.05, Figure 5B; see Experimental Procedures). We
obtained similar results of cell viability assays based on cell counting (Figure S3C). Since
these RNA editing events show cross-tumor clinical relevance, we further examined their
effects in a different lineage. We performed similar viability assays in Ba/F3 cells, which is
a murine leukemia cell line and an established drug screening platform for subsequent
investigation (Cheung et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2012), and observed the same patterns (ttest, p < 0.05, Figure 5C). To examine the effects on cell survival, we assessed levels of
active caspase 3 in MCF10A and found no significant changes (Figure S3D). These results
were confirmed by a cell death detection ELISA kit (data not shown). To examine the
effects on cell migration, we performed wound healing assays in MFC10A and observed no
substantial effects (Figure S3E).
Therapeutic liability of clinically relevant nonsynonymous RNA editing sites

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A critical question about RNA editing is whether some RNA editing could affect the
response of cancer therapies. This question has significant clinical implications but has
never been investigated. Given their confirmed “driver” behaviors in Ba/F3 (Figure 5C), we
focused on the RNA editing in AZIN1, GRIA2 and COG3 and examined whether these
events alter drug sensitivity using a high-throughput Ba/F3 differential cytotoxicity screen
(Cheung et al., 2014; Quayle et al., 2012). Ba/F3 cells depend on interleukin-3 (IL-3) for
proliferation, but readily become IL3-independent in the presence of an oncogene or
oncogenic event (Liang et al., 2012). We screened 145 compounds targeting major signaling
pathways in Ba/F3 addicted to these RNA editing events (in the absence of IL-3) and
performed a “counterscreen” with the same Ba/F3 cells cultured with exogenous IL-3 to
control for the cytotoxic activity of the compounds. In addition, we used a spontaneously
transformed Ba/F3 cell line (originally transfected with PIK3R1 but not expressing
significant levels of PIK3R1) as negative controls. Strikingly, compared to the wild-type
genes, the edited genes selectively affected the sensitivity of Ba/F3 cells to several targeted
therapeutics, including AZIN1S367G for the IGF-1R inhibitor BMS536924, GRIA2R764G for
MEK inhibitors CI1040 and PD0325901, COG3I635V for MEK inhibitors CI1040,
PD0325901 and trametinib (Figure 6A shows representative examples).
Furthermore, we examined the editing levels of the 35 clinically relevant nonsynonymous
RNA editing sites (Table S3) in cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
(Barretina et al., 2012) and examined their correlations with the sensitivity data (IC50) of 24
drugs available at the CCLE portal. Interestingly, we found that the editing levels of 16
RNA editing sites were significantly correlated with drug sensitivity (FDR < 0.1, Figure

Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 October 12.

6B). Furthermore, across RNA editing sites, the drug clustering analysis showed meaningful
patterns: three chemotherapy agents, paclitaxel, irinotecan and topotecan, were clustered
together and their sensitivities were associated with the editing in AZIN1 and other sites;
erlotinib was in the same cluster as the HER2 agent lapatinib; two RAF inhibitors, PLX4720
and RAF265, were adjacent to one another; and two MEK inhibitors, AZD6244 and
PD0325901, were tightly correlated. These results suggest that the effects of RNA editing on
drug response are not limited to the cases we examined.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The advent of next-generation sequencing data has drawn widespread attention to the
analysis of RNA editing (Li et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2012; Piskol et al., 2013; Ramaswami
et al., 2012; Ramaswami et al., 2013); however, these studies have mainly focused on RNA
editing events in normal tissues. More recently, a functional role for RNA editing in
tumorigenesis has begun to emerge, but related studies have been limited to individual
examples. The present study represents a systematic investigation of the global pattern and
clinical relevance of A-to-I RNA editing across a broad range of cancer types and normal
tissues.

Author Manuscript

The number of A-to-I RNA editing sites in humans is huge, but most sites exhibit editing at
very low levels (Bazak et al., 2014), leading to a great challenge in detecting editing sites in
a comprehensive manner. To ensure the high-quality analysis, we started with the highconfidence RNA editing sites reported in previous studies rather than calling novel editing
sites without prior knowledge. We focused on RNA editing events with detected editing
signals in multiple TCGA samples and further filtered those with potential mutational
signals at the DNA level. Although “false” RNA-editing sites due to SNPs or mutations
might not be completely removed, such noise in our data should be very rare. Because of the
large number of RNA editing candidates identified in normal tissues in the RADAR
database, we obtained sufficient numbers of RNA editing sites to assess the global patterns
of A-to-I RNA editing. Further, the strong linear correlation between informative editing
sites per cancer type and the total number of mapped reads (or bases) across cancer types
indicates that our RNA editing sets are not biased towards well-studied cancer types.

Author Manuscript

The rich TCGA dataset allowed us to address some important questions about RNA editing
on a large scale. We revealed a diversity of altered RNA editing events in tumor samples
relative to normal tissues, which correlates best with the ADAR1 expression level globally.
Note that this observation does not rule out the important role of ADAR2-mediated editing
events in specific cancer types, as demonstrated in previous studies (Cenci et al., 2008;
Galeano et al., 2013; Maas et al., 2001; Tomaselli et al., 2015). Based on the correlations of
RNA editing levels with tumor subtype, stage or survival, we detected an appreciable
number of RNA editing sites with potential clinical relevance (~3.5% of the total
informative RNA editing sites examined). These editing sites show marked editing
difference for distinct patient groups within a cancer type, and they may represent promising
biomarker candidates for further assessment. An alternative way to infer clinically relevance
could be based on levels of edited transcripts. However, unlike the editing level, which is a
parameter independent from the expression level of the edited gene, the levels of edited

transcripts are linked to the gene expression level itself. Indeed, we observed that for a large
proportion of RNA editing sites with clinical correlations based on the level of edited
transcripts, their gene expression levels also showed corresponding correlations, suggesting
the potential confounding effects of gene expression on detecting clinical relevance.
Therefore, we focused on the editing-level-based clinically relevant sites in this study. Our
datasets (both raw data and clinically relevant sites) have been made publically available
through Synapse (Omberg et al., 2013), and thus provide a valuable resource for
systematically dissecting the clinical utility of RNA editing.

Importantly, we experimentally investigated the functional effects of several
nonsynonymous RNA editing events with potential clinical relevance across multiple tumor
types, including the well-studied editing site in AZIN1 and the other two previously
functionally uncharacterized RNA editing sites in COG3 and GRIA2. Moreover, our study
provides the evidence that a specific RNA editing event could selectively affect therapeutic
responses. We demonstrated that the RNA editing event in COG3 and GRIA2 increased
sensitivity to some targeted agents whereas the editing in AZIN1 engendered decreased
sensitivity. Mutations in cancer genes can increase or decrease sensitivity to the same
therapeutic agent based on where they are located in the targeted pathway. For example,
mutations in the EGFR receptor increase sensitivity to drugs targeting the EGFR. However,
mutations in KRAS which is clearly a driver can result in resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
Furthermore, if the editing is a neomorph, it could either increase or decrease to the
sensitivity to a specific drug. Thus, some RNA editing events may be functionally
equivalent to “driver” mutations, making a notable contribution to tumor initiation and
growth as well as playing a critical role in response to cancer therapy. Together, our findings
highlight RNA editing as an exciting theme for investigating cancer mechanisms,
identifying biomarkers, and developing therapeutic targets. Further efforts should be made
to characterize the function of other clinically relevant RNA editing events (especially those
in noncoding regions), to elucidate the interactions of these editing events with other types
of molecular aberrations, and to investigate their utility in clinical practice.

Experimental Procedures
Characterization of A-to-I RNA editing profiles

Author Manuscript

We downloaded RNA-seq BAM files of 5672 patient tumor samples across 17 TCGA
cancer types and their related 564 non-tumor tissue samples (if available) from the UCSC
Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub, https://cghub.ucsc.edu/). We also downloaded 740 BAM
files of CCLE cell lines from CGHub. The detailed read mapping procedure (BAM
generation) was previously described in TCGA marker papers (Brennan et al., 2013; The
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2012a; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2012b; The Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2012c; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013a; The

We obtained a comprehensive collection of ~1.4 million A-to-I RNA editing sites from the
Rigorously Annotated Databases of A-to-I RNA Editing (RADAR, http://rnaedit.com/)
(Ramaswami and Li, 2014). Note that these RNA editing sites were directly called from

RNA-seq data from normal tissues and tumor samples, not from the comparison of editing
profiles upon ADAR perturbation. We re-annotated them by ANNOVAR (Wang et al.,
2010), and then filtered ~4,000 sites annotated in dbSNP (version 137), COSMIC and
TCGA somatic mutations. Based on the RNA-seq reads mapped to the human reference
genome (hg19), the editing level at a specific site in a given sample was calculated as the
number of edited reads divided by the total number of reads (Ramaswami et al., 2013), and
only the nucleotides with a base quality ≥ 20 were used. Those editing sites with at least 3
edited reads in at least 3 samples per tissue type were considered to be detected RNA editing
sites. To ensure adequate statistical power, we further identified the informative RNA
editing sites among the detected RNA editing sites by requiring at least 30 samples
(including normal samples if available) with a coverage ≥ 10 in a tissue/tumor type. Thus,
given a cancer type, the tumor samples and their related normal samples had the same set of
informative RNA editing sites in our analysis. To further rule out the possibility of potential
contamination due to undetected SNPs or somatic mutations, we obtained whole-genome
sequencing data from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and whole-exome
sequencing data from TCGA for the cancer types we surveyed and assessed if there were
some potential mutational signals at informative RNA editing sites. We only found potential
mutational signals at 310 sites out of 112572 across the 17 cancer types (0.28%) and
excluded them from our analysis. RNA editing profiles were uploaded to Synapse
(syn2374375), and are publically available.
Comparisons of RNA editing patterns between cancer and normal samples

Author Manuscript

For the comparison between tumor and normal samples, we required the informative RNA
editing sites with at least 5 pairs of tumor and normal samples with a coverage ≥ 10. If
sufficient matched normal samples in which a site had adequate coverage were not
available, the site was excluded from our analysis. We used the Wilcoxon test to detect RNA
editing sites with differential editing between tumor and normal samples, and defined
significantly differential editing sites as FDR < 0.05 and a mean editing level difference ≥
5%. TCGA mRNA expression data were obtained from TCGA Synapse portal (syn300013)
(Omberg et al., 2013). We used the paired student t-test to detect differentially expressed
ADAR enzymes between normal and tumor samples.
Identification of clinically relevant RNA editing sites

Author Manuscript

We obtained clinical information, including tumor subtypes, disease stage, and patient
overall survival time from TCGA marker papers, or TCGA data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). We used the Wilcoxon test or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric
ANOVA to detect RNA editing sites with differential editing among different tumor
subtypes, and considered FDR < 0.01 to be statistically significant. We used the Wilcoxon
test or Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA to detect RNA editing sites with differential
editing among different tumor stages, and considered FDR < 0.05 to be statistically
significant. We used the univariate Cox test to examine whether the RNA editing level was
significantly correlated with patient survival, and considered FDR < 0.05 to be statistically
significant. We chose different FDR cutoffs based on the signal abundance in each analysis.
Groups with fewer than 5 samples were excluded from the analysis. We required a mean
RNA editing level difference, Diff ≥ 5% for at least two groups, thereby ensuring a sufficient

biological difference. The gene-annotation-based RNA type of an RNA editing site was
annotated by ANNOVAR, and the sequence repetitive status and evolutionary conservation
status (i.e., the conservation among humans, chimpanzees, and macaques) were annotated as
in RADAR (Ramaswami and Li, 2014). To test the effect of tumor purity, we obtained the
tumor purity data based on ABSOLUTE from synapse (syn1710466, https://
www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1710466)(Carter et al., 2012), and repeated the analysis
with the tumor purity as a covariate in the ANOVA. We repeated the above analysis for the
nonsynonymous RNA editing sites only, and considered FDR < 0.2 to indicate statistical
significance. We then ranked the nonsynonymous RNA editing sites based on the number of
cancer types with detected significance.

Author Manuscript

To assess if clinically relevant RNA editing sites are enriched in some RNA regions, we
performed a coverage-dependent permutation test. First, for each cancer type, we classified
all the informative RNA editing sites into 10 coverage groups (each with the same number
of editing sites) based on the median coverage of a given RNA editing site across all
sufficiently covered samples. Second, given the numbers of clinically relevant sites observed
in each group, we randomly selected the same number of RNA editing sites as “pseudo
clinically relevant sites”, so the whole pseudo set would have the same coverage distribution
as the true clinically relevant sites. We then counted the frequencies of pseudo clinically
relevant sites for each type of RNA region. We repeated this process for 1000 times, and
based on the obtained distributions of these permutations, we assessed the statistical
significance of the enrichment of the clinically relevant sites relative to the random
expectation (defined as the frequency of permutations with the number of pseudo clinically
relevant sites no fewer than the observed true clinically relevant sites). We did this analysis
for each cancer type separately.

Sequenom validation
Four selected RNA editing sites, AZIN1S367D, COPAI164V, COG3I635V, and GRIA2R764G,
were validated on in-house breast cancer samples by Sequenom MassARRAY at MD
Anderson Sequenome Core Facility, as previously described (Liang et al., 2012).
Generation of stable BaF3 and MCF10A cell lines

Author Manuscript

The mutant open reading frames (ORFs) corresponding to the RNA editing sites in AZIN1,
GRIA2 (the mutation was introduced at the R764G site only and the codon at Q607R
remained as wild-type CAG) and COG3 were made by site-directed mutagenesis and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Virus were produced by transfecting HEK293PA cells
with the GFP control vectors or pHAGE-V5-puromycin expression vectors (carrying
AZIN1-WT, AZIN1-S367D, GRIA2-WT, GRIA2-R764G, COG3-WT or COG3-I635V), and
the Lentiviral Packaging Mix (psPAX2 and pMD2.G). BaF3 cells were transduced by the
virus and were added RPMI 1640 medium/5% FBS in the low IL3 (0.0001ng/ml) and put
back into the incubator for 4 weeks, followed by selection with puromycin (0.6 g/ml) and
IL-3 withdrawal. Stable Ba/F3 cells were maintained in medium without IL-3. MCF10A
cells were transduced by the virus followed by selection with puromycin (0.6 μg/ml). Stable
MCF10A cells were maintained in completed DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) full medium with
5% Horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 10 ug/ml insulin (Sigma),

selection, expression of the constructs was verified by Western blots.
Cell extract preparation and western blotting
Whole-cell lysates for western blotting were extracted with RIPA (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease, and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail). Cell lysates (20 ug) were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and protein expression was depicted with an enhanced
chemiluminescence western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used
were AZIN1, Antizyme inhibitor 1Polyclonal antibody (Proteintech), GRIA2, AMPA
Receptor (GluR2) (E1L8U) Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology), COG3 polyclonal
antibody (Proteintech), V5 Tag Mouse Monoclonal Antibody (Life technologies), and ERK2

BaF3 and MCF10A cell viability assay
BaF3 cells were transduced by the virus, and resuspended in BaF3 low IL-3 medium
(0.0001 ng/ml). Then the cells were transferred to a 96-well plate and the assays were
performed at week 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 time points. Stable MCF10A cell lines were seeded into
96-well plates, and the assays were performed at day 0, 4, 8, 10 and 12 time points.
CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to access cell viability according to
manufacturer's instructions. The cell viability measurement was also performed based on
cell counting after trypsin digestion. The significance of differences was analyzed with
Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Apoptosis assay

Cells (1.5×104) were seeded into 6-well plates for 24 hr before incubation with MCF10A
full medium, MEBM added BPE (Lonza, Allendale, NJ), or DMEM medium without
glucose and L-glutamine for another 24 hr. Apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation was
measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN) according to manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis-induced the active form of
caspase-3 was tested using the PE Rabbit Anti-Active Caspase-3 (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. BD Canto II analyzer is used to read active
caspase-3 in the PE channel.

Ba/F3 drug screening assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The IL-3–dependent Ba/F3 parental cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 5% FBS and 5 ng/ml of IL-3. The spontaneously transformed Ba/F3 cell line was
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS without IL-3. Stable Ba/F3 cell lines
expressing the wild-type and edited genes were obtained and maintained by selection of
puromycin (0.6 ug/ml) and IL-3 withdrawal. The 145-compound library was purchased from
the John S. Dunn Gulf Coast Consortium for Chemical Genomics (Houston, TX). These
compounds were dissolved in DMSO as 10 mM stock solutions. The day before treatment,
cells (1×104) were seeded in 96-well plates in medium with or without IL-3. Eight serial
dilutions of each compound were prepared in media, and final drug concentrations ranged
from 0 to 10 μM. Cells were treated with DMSO or drug compounds in the presence or
absence of IL-3 for 72 hr. Cell viability was determined using PrestoBlue (Promega,
Madison, WI) for mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. Drug screening was repeated
independently to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
To comprehensively assess the effects of RNA editing sites on drug sensitivity, we
downloaded the drug screening data from CCLE (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home),
and calculated the correlations between the RNA editing level and IC50.

Significance
ADAR-mediated A-to-I RNA editing represents a widespread, phylogentically
conserved, post-transcriptional mechanism to engender genomic diversity by
reproducibly changing RNA sequences without a concomitant change in DNA
sequences. The role of RNA editing in human cancer is only beginning to emerge from
early studies of individual candidates in a few cancer types. Our systematic analysis of
RNA editing across 17 cancer types demonstrates an appreciable number of RNA editing
events associated with clinical characteristics of tumors and patient outcomes, some of
which show functional effects on cell viability and drug sensitivity. Thus, aberrant RNA
editing provides an underexplored mechanism to reproducibly alter protein or regulatory
RNA sequences that could act as drivers and represent potential biomarkers or
therapeutic targets in cancer.

of over-editing sites minus the percentage of under-editing sites) and the relative mRNA
expression of ADAR1 (left), ADAR2 (middle), and ADAR3 (right) (fold change relative to
normal tissues). To robustly detect a meaningful relation, the rank-based Spearman
correlations were used and plotted. (C) Distribution of editing-level difference in BRCA
relative to matched normal breast tissue samples (left panel) and the mRNA expression level
of ADAR1 (right panel) (red in tumor and blue in normal). (D) Distribution of editing level
difference in KICH samples relative to matched normal kidney samples. (A) and (B) overediting sites are in red; under-editing sites are in blue. (C) and (D) The paired Wilcoxon test
was used to assess the difference between paired tumor and normal samples. The boxes

Figure 3. Identification and patterns of clinically relevant RNA editing sites

(A) The overview of clinically relevant RNA editing sites identified by three complementary
computational analyses: differential analysis among tumor subtypes, differential analysis
among tumor stages, and correlation analysis with patient overall survivals. An explicative
cartoon is shown for illustration purposes. (B-D) Statistical significance for the enrichment
or depletion patterns of clinically relevant RNA editing sites through coverage-dependent
permutation tests across 12 tumor types for different types of RNA regions: gene annotation
(B), non-repetitive (C), non-Alu repetitive and Alu elements, and evolutionary conservation
(D). See also Table S2.

Figure 4. Clinical relevance of nonsynonymous A-to-I RNA editing sites

Author Manuscript

(A) The clinical relevance of 8 nonsynonymous RNA editing sites identified in multiple
cancer types. For each cancer type, the grey box indicates not significant, the red box
indicates the significant differential editing among tumor subtypes (FDR < 0.2, Diff ≥ 5%),
the green box indicates the significant differential editing among stages (FDR < 0.2, Diff ≥
5%), the blue box indicates the association with the overall survival (FDR < 0.2, Diff ≥ 5%).
(B-E) The representative plots showing clinical relevance of nonsynonymous RNA editing
events in AZIN1S367D (CRC subtype: CIN, chromosomal instability; MSI, microsatellite
instability) (B), COPAI164V (STAD subtype: CIN, chromosomal instability; EBV, Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV)-positive; GS, genomically stable; MSI, microsatellite instability) (C),
COG3I635V (D) and GRIA2R764G (E). The boxes show the median±1 quartile, with whiskers
extending to the most extreme data point within 1.5 interquartile range from the box
boundaries. See also Figure S2, Table S3.

Figure 5. Sequenom validation and functional effects of nonsynonymous RNA editing sites on
cell viability

Author Manuscript

(A) Sequenom validation of AZIN1S367D. The upper panels show the results of a group of
samples at cDNA and gDNA, respectively, where each blue symbol represents the AG
genotype of a sample; while the bottom panels show the results of an individual sample in
cDNA and gDNA, respectively, where there are one “A” peak and one “G” peak in cDNA
but only one “A” peak in gDNA. (B) The effects of AZIN1S367D, GRIA2R764G and
COG3I635V in MCF10A cell viability assays. (C) The effects of AZIN1S367D, GRIA2R764G
and COG3I635V in BaF3 cell viability assays. Two-sided t-test was used to assess the
difference. Error bars denote +/− SEM, * denotes p < 0.05, ** denotes p <0.001, and ***
denotes p < 0.0001. See also Figure S3.

Figure 6. Effects of nonsynonymous RNA editing sites on drug sensitivity

Author Manuscript

(A) Spontaneously transformed Ba/F3 cells (negative control), Ba/F3 cells stably expressing
AZIN1 and AZIN1S367D, GRIA2 and GRIA2R764G , COG3 and COG3I635V were screened
against the drug library with or without IL-3 for 72 hr. Dose-response curves for the IGF-1R
inhibitor BMS536924, the MEK inhibitors CI1040 and trametinib. The drugs were dissolved
in DMSO, and only DMSO was added at the drug concentration of 0 as a control. At each
drug dosage, the relative cell viability (measured based on three independent replicates) was
obtained by normalizing the absolute cell viability to the DMSO control to remove the
baseline difference between Ba/F3 cells with and without IL-3. Error bars denote +/− SD.
(B) A heatmap showing the correlations of the RNA editing levels of 35 clinically relevant
nonsynonymous sites with the IC50 values of 24 clinical drugs across CCLE cell line. The
highlighted boxes indicate significant correlations at FDR < 0.1.
