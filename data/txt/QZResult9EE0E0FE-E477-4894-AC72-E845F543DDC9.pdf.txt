Endocrine therapy for breast cancer was introduced more than 100 years ago. In
the last 30 years, it has been demonstrated that tamoxifen significantly improves
outcomes for patients with hormone-responsive breast tumors. Aromatase inhibitors, which suppress the production of estrogen, are recognized today as an
effective alternative for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, despite an initial response to treatment, many tumors
eventually recur or progress. When selecting subsequent endocrine therapy, it is
helpful to understand the mechanisms of hormone resistance, consider the goals
of treatment, and evaluate the clinical potential of each available drug. The
objective of this article was to review the underlying mechanisms of action and
resistance for each type of hormone therapy, evaluate the most recent data
regarding the use of endocrine agents after disease progression or recurrence,
and explore potential combinations of hormone therapies with novel molecules
that target key growth factor signaling pathways. Cancer 2008;113:2385–97.

he influence of ovarian hormones on breast cancer was appreciated first more than 100 years ago, when Beatson demonstrated that inoperable breast tumors regress after oophorectomy.1
Since then, pharmacologic antiestrogen measures have been developed and have been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients with both early- and late-stage hormone
receptor-positive (HR1) breast cancer. Because approximately 75%
of postmenopausal women with breast cancer have tumors that are
positive for estrogen receptor (ER) expression, antiestrogen therapy
plays a role in disease management for the majority of patients with
breast cancer.2 Today, 2 classes of antihormone endocrine agents
are considered the standard of care for primary treatment of earlyor late-stage HR1 breast cancer: tamoxifen, which blocks ER activity
within tumor cells, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), such as anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, which inhibit the production of estrogen through the aromatase enzyme pathway. Whereas tamoxifen is
effective in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, AIs
are indicated only in women who are postmenopausal. In the adjuvant setting, several studies have demonstrated that AIs are tolerated well and offer improved disease-free survival compared with

tamoxifen3-5 or placebo.6 The benefits of AIs also
have been demonstrated in the metastatic7-10 and
neoadjuvant settings.11-14
Despite an initial response to hormone therapy
(whether in the adjuvant or metastatic setting), many
patients will progress during therapy. Although it is
standard practice in recurrent or progressive HR1
breast cancer to switch to a different endocrine
agent, many questions remain unanswered regarding
the appropriate choice of a subsequent agent.15,16 In
any event, the goals of treatment for patients with
metastatic breast cancer are to provide clinical benefit (response, stable disease) with the aim of prolonging life, delaying disease progression, maintaining
quality of life (QOL), and postponing the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy that may further impair QOL.
The objectives of this article are to review the underlying mechanisms of action and resistance for each
type of hormone therapy, evaluate recent data
regarding the use of subsequent endocrine agents after recurrence or progression on initial treatment,
and explore the future directions of hormone agents.

Mechanisms of Estrogen Receptor Activation
The classic mechanism of steroid hormone action
involves estrogen binding to ERs in the nucleus,
thereby promoting association with specific estrogen-response elements in the promoter region of target genes.17 However, it is well documented that
significant populations of ERs may be located outside the nucleus18 and that ERs also regulate the
expression of many genes without directly binding to
DNA but by interacting with other transcription factors, such as activator protein 1, and with extranuclear signaling complexes that modulate downstream
gene expression.19
When they are not bound by estrogen, ERs often
interact with coregulator proteins that modulate ER
activity20 and/or with chaperone proteins that stabilize the receptor or hide its DNA-binding domain.
There are 2 major subtypes of ERs—ERa and ERb—
each with different isoforms and splice variants.21
ERa is expressed predominantly as a 66-kD transcript
in breast tumors,22 whereas ERb occurs as the product of a different gene.18 ERb has structural homology
to ERa, particularly in the DNA-binding domain (95%
amino acid identity) and in the ligand-binding domain (55% amino acid identity).23 Ongoing work indicates that ERb can modulate ERa activity, suggesting
that ERb and its splice variants may affect the responsiveness of breast cancer to estradiol.24
ERs are activated by 2 general mechanisms:
ligand-dependent activation (the classic pathway), in

which estrogen binds to the ER and the resulting
estrogen-ER unit then interacts directly with DNA to
regulate gene transcription; and ligand-independent
activation, in which an ER is activated, in part, after
phosphorylation by growth factor receptors or other
molecules with serine or tyrosine kinase domains
(Fig. 1).18 Both ligand-dependent and ligiand-independent ER activation can lead to the modulation of
downstream intracellular signaling cascades.18,21 In
this way, activation of the ER pathway ultimately
may lead to tumor progression and the proliferation
of tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells.25,26

Mechanisms of Resistance to Hormone Therapy
With increased understanding of the complex, interconnecting signaling pathways that regulate cellular
responses to estrogen has come a realization that
tumor cells may take a multitude of different avenues to become resistant to antiestrogen therapy.
Unraveling this complexity is essential for optimizing the use and sequencing of currently available
drugs and for developing new and more potent
ones.
Resistance to therapy may be described either as
intrinsic or de novo (a tumor does not respond to a
drug from the onset of therapy) or as acquired (a tumor that initially responded to therapy resumes
growing).27 One potential cause of intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen is a genetic polymorphism in the
enzyme pathway involved in metabolizing tamoxifen
to its more active metabolite, endoxifen. Results
from pharmacogenetic studies have revealed that
patients treated with tamoxifen who have certain
polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 2D6
(CYP2D6) gene (leading to a lower level of endoxifen)
may have a higher risk of recurrence.28,29 Although
those results are intriguing, additional studies are
needed to assess possible relations between this
genotype and resistance to tamoxifen therapy.
Whereas genetic polymorphisms reflect innate differences in tamoxifen responsiveness, there also are
many potential mechanisms of acquired resistance,
some theoretical and others supported by preclinical
or clinical data (Table 1).27,30,31 Antiestrogen-resistant
tumors may develop through clonal selection of tumor cell subsets with altered HR expression,
response to tamoxifen, ER structure, or activation of
ER pathways.
Altered hormone receptor expression
Whereas loss of ERa expression has been demonstrated in 17% to 28% of patients who have acquired
resistance to tamoxifen, mutations in the ERa receptor rarely are found, suggesting that this is an un-

likely mechanism of tamoxifen resistance.30 The finding that ER expression is maintained in the majority
of tamoxifen-resistant tumors suggests that the unresponsive phenotype is caused by a complex, multifactorial change in the expression of a network of
genes rather than a simple, single-gene effect. This
also may explain why approximately 66% of patients
who develop recurrent disease on tamoxifen will
respond to AIs or to fulvestrant.31 Loss of progesterone receptor (PR) expression, possibly related to sustained stimulation of growth factor-signaling

pathways that suppress expression of the PR gene,
appears to be another mechanism leading to tamoxifen resistance, but not to AI resistance.30,32 Preclinical and clinical data also indicate that increased
expression of ER coregulator molecules may increase
the agonistic effect of tamoxifen, contributing to resistance.30 Evidence exists that estrogen-independent
growth may be associated with a high level of ERa,33
and others have reported changes in expression
levels of ERa but little change in ERb expression in
tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant tumors.34

Altered crosstalk between estrogen receptors and
growth factors
Altered expression of growth factors and signaling
proteins also may contribute to the antiestrogenresistant phenotype. Candidate molecules include
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR),
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/
neu), tumor necrosis factor alpha, protein kinase C
alpha (PKCa), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) phosphatase 3, and p21-activated kinase
1.35-39 Evidence suggests that receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling has an impact on resistance to endocrine
therapy by modulating the subcellular localization of
ER coregulators.40 Preclinical data suggest that ERa
function is maintained in the tamoxifen-resistant
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line through EGFR/MAPKmediated signaling.41
Data from preclinical studies and from retrospective analyses of clinical trials indicate that HER2/neu overexpression is a negative predictor of response to tamoxifen and, to a lesser extent, AIs.42-44
Changes in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
(IGF-1R)/IGF-1 pathway also may be responsible for
resistance to antiestrogen therapy.42 Understanding
the precise mechanisms and outcomes of crosstalk
between ERs and these molecules remains incomplete; however, ligand-independent activation of ER
may play an important role. The complexity and redundancy observed in these interconnected path-

ways suggest that concurrent or sequential inhibition
of multiple pathways may be a better strategy to
improve response to endocrine therapy and reduce
the development of resistance.18,45,46

Effects of long-term estrogen deprivation
Human breast cancer cells that are deprived of estradiol adapt by developing estrogen hypersensitivity
(Fig. 2).47,48 This may explain the clinical observation
in which hormone-dependent breast cancer that
initially regressed after oophorectomy-induced estradiol deprivation in premenopausal women regrew in
response to low-dose estradiol and regressed further
after exposure to AIs. Additional studies in breast
cancer cell lines subjected to long-term estrogendeprivation (LTED) demonstrated that these cells first
became hypersensitive to low-dose estrogen and
then became estrogen independent.49 The acquired
hypersensitivity appeared to be linked to increased
expression of ERa and ERb and was accompanied by
a ligand-independent increase in ERa phosphorylation.49 Results from several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that tumors undergo 3 stages that lead
to tamoxifen resistance: In stage 1, tamoxifen acts as
an estrogen antagonist; in stage 2, the tumor increasingly becomes sensitive to the agonistic (proestrogenic) effects of tamoxifen; and, in stage 3, the
tumor has increased sensitivity (hypersensitivity) to
estradiol (as shown in Fig. 3).50,51 Long-term expo-

sure of breast cancer to tamoxifen, thus, may lead to
estrogen hypersensitivity, which, in turn, creates an
environment that selects for the growth of tumors
with tamoxifen resistance.52 The possibility that
LTED with tamoxifen leads to estrogen hypersensitivity bolsters the rationale for using agents that do not
have proestrogenic activity (eg, AIs, fulvestrant) for
breast cancer that has progressed or recurred on tamoxifen.52 Therefore, the concept of adaptive hypersensitivity to estradiol and the biologic mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon have important clinical
implications.

Biologic Basis of Sequential Endocrine Therapy
After resistance to initial endocrine therapy for breast
cancer develops, no clear treatment guidelines exist
regarding subsequent hormone treatment for
patients with recurrent or systemic disease. Although
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
recommend second-line hormone therapy (nonsteroidal or steroidal AIs; fulvestrant or other selective
estrogen-receptor modulators [SERMs]; estrogen
antagonists; and estrogens, progestins, or androgens)
in patients with systemic disease, the guidelines do
not recommend a preferred treatment or the appropriate sequencing of agents in this setting.15
The remaining critical issues faced by clinicians
and their patients are the timing and choice of

xenograft (A) and uterine (B) weight in mice after long-term (5-month) treatment with tamoxifen (black bars) or vehicle (gray bars).51 Reprinted from

second-line therapy. A primary consideration is the
nature of the response to initial hormone therapy,
because it is an excellent predictor of subsequent
response, even when a patient’s tumor becomes refractory to current hormone therapy. An estimated
40% to 50% of patients with breast cancer who had a
response to initial hormone therapy will respond to
subsequent treatment with other hormone agents.53

Other important considerations include the efficacy and safety profiles of available options and
issues related to patient compliance with treatment.
Because of possible cross-resistance, it is also important to select a drug for subsequent treatment that
has a different mechanism of action from the initial
therapy.53 Minimally toxic endocrine therapies usually are preferred over cytotoxic chemotherapy given
its greater potential for serious adverse events (AEs)
and effects on QOL.15

Treatment options after initial therapy with an aromatase
inhibitor and/or tamoxifen
The optimal sequence of hormone therapy remains
to be established in randomized, controlled clinical
trials. However, depending on the initial therapy, we
describe current options after treatment failure.
Whereas tamoxifen historically has been the firstchoice therapy for postmenopausal women with
ER1 early breast cancer; now, it is surpassed increasingly by the AIs administered either alone or in
sequence with tamoxifen, because AIs produce a significant benefit in the primary adjuvant setting.54 In
patients who were treated previously with tamoxifen,
an AI can be used as subsequent therapy. Several
trials demonstrated that AIs significantly prolong survival55,56 and time to disease progression55-57 versus
megestrol acetate when used as second-line therapy
in advanced ER1 breast cancer after failure on firstline tamoxifen. However, the converse (tamoxifen as
second-line therapy after an AI) may not be viable in
some patients because of the potential for tamoxifen
resistance in LTED cells. Although some evidence
suggests that the AIs may differ in terms of their
pharmacokinetics58 and potencies,59 the biologic
meaning and clinical utility of these findings remain
unresolved. It is noteworthy that there is some evidence in favor of fulvestrant as a viable option in
this situation, because it induces antitumor effects in
LTED cells.60
Fulvestrant as an option after failure on aromatase
inhibitors or tamoxifen
Antagonist versus Agonist Properties. Like tamoxifen,
fulvestrant completely inhibits binding of estradiol to
the ER, although fulvestrant has a higher affinity
than tamoxifen for the ER.61 Unlike tamoxifen, fulvestrant induces a conformational change in the ER
and inhibits receptor dimerization, rendering the
complex transcriptionally inactive. Fulvestrant binding also reduces nuclear uptake of the drug-receptor
complex, inhibits coactivator recruitment and ER
binding to estrogen-responsive genes, and enhances
rapid degradation of the receptor. Thus, fulvestrant is

considered a pure estrogen antagonist with no agonist activity. Unlike tamoxifen or the AIs, fulvestrant
completely inhibits ER signaling.61 In addition, fulvestrant, as an ER down-regulator, has a unique biologic mechanism of action compared with other
available hormone agents, including AIs and tamoxifen. There are several pathways involved in ER activation, as detailed above. The finding that fulvestrant
directly targets the ER and leads to both cessation of
ER signaling and ER degradation may prevent or
postpone resistant disease.62-64
Studies in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo have demonstrated that, although LTED cells
are refractory to treatment with tamoxifen, they are
sensitive to treatment with fulvestrant (Fig. 4).49,60
These cells reportedly had enhanced ERa and IGFIR/insulin receptor substrate-2 expression and signaling, supporting a role for these molecules in the
stimulation of tumor growth by tamoxifen and suggesting a mechanism for their susceptibility to fulvestrant.60 These experiments provided the rationale
for the clinical development of fulvestrant as a treatment for HR1 breast cancer that is refractory to antiestrogen therapy.
Further evidence of the lack of agonistic effects
of fulvestrant comes from clinical trials results in
healthy volunteers and women with breast cancer.
Results from a phase 1 trial in healthy postmenopausal volunteers demonstrated that, compared with
placebo, fulvestrant administered as a single intramuscular injection did not have estrogenic effects on
the endometrium and significantly inhibited estrogen-stimulated thickening of the endometrium.65
When administered as a monthly intramuscular
injection in women with advanced breast cancer, fulvestrant had minor effects on serum hormones and
lipid levels and did not induce or aggravate hot
flushes, sweats, or vaginal dryness, all of which are
AEs frequently associated with tamoxifen treatments.66
Efficacy and safety of fulvestrant. Overall, phase 3
trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and
tolerability between fulvestrant and anastrozole (after
tamoxifen failure) or exemestane (after nonsteroidal
AI failure).
Phase 3 comparison of fulvestrant versus anastrozole. The
efficacy of fulvestrant versus anastrozole was established in 2 randomized, controlled clinical trials (1
conducted in North America and 1 conducted in Europe, Australia, and South Africa) in postmenopausal
women with locally advanced or metastatic breast
cancer.67-69 In a prospectively planned, combined
analysis of those trials, a total of 851 postmenopausal

vestrant (CRs and partial responses) was 16.7 months
versus 13.7 months for those who responded to anastrozole. In addition, a retrospective analysis indicated
that 43 of 82 patients (52%) who responded to fulvestrant maintained their response for >12 months versus
30 of 70 patients (43%) for anastrozole (P 5.16).70 With
an extended median follow-up of 27 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 27.4 months for the fulvestrant treatment arm and 27.7 months for the
anastrozole group (hazard ratio, 0.98; P 5.809).68
Fulvestrant and anastrozole were tolerated similarly well. The only AE category that differed between
the 2 groups was joint disorders, which were more
frequent in the anastrozole arm (P 5 .0036).67

The Evaluation of Faslodex versus Exemestane Clinical Trial (EFECT), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 3 trial, demonstrated similar benefits
with fulvestrant loading dose (500 mg on Day 0, followed by 250 mg on Days 14 and 28, with 250 mg
monthly thereafter) versus exemestane 25 mg daily
in postmenopausal women with HR-positive
advanced breast cancer that progressed or recurred
after nonsteroidal AI therapy.71
In the EFECT trial, the median TTP was 3.7
months for both treatment groups (hazard ratio,
0.963; 95% confidence interval, 0.819-1.133; P 5
.6531).71 The ORR (7.4% for fulvestrant vs 6.7% for
exemestane; P 5 .736) and the clinical benefit rate
(CBR), which was defined as the ORR and stable disease that lasted 24 weeks, also were similar
between the 2 groups (32.2% for fulvestrant vs 31.5%
for exemestane; P 5 .853).71 The median response
duration from the time of randomization was 13.5
months for fulvestrant and 9.8 months for exemestane.71 More recently, at a median follow-up of 20.9
months, OS did not differ significantly between the
fulvestrant and exemestane treatment arms (P 5
.9072; median OS, 24.3 months vs 23.1 months,
respectively).71 The 2 treatment arms had similar AE
profiles, with only 2% and 2.6% of fulvestrant- and
exemestane-treated patients withdrawing because of
an AE, respectively.71 These data support the efficacy
and safety of fulvestrant (loading dose) and exemestane as hormone therapy after AI failure.
In addition to the approved dose, alternate dosing strategies, including the loading dose and high
dose, were used in several recently completed trials
(eg, EFECT; Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy for
Women With Estrogen-Sensitive Tumors [NEWEST])
and currently are under investigation in ongoing fulvestrant trials (eg, the COmparisoN of Faslodex In
Recurrent or Metastatic breast cancer [CONFIRM]
trial and the FINDER clinical fulvestrant trials) to

further elucidate the optimal fulvestrant dosing strategy.72 Pharmacokinetic evidence suggests that using
the loading dose substantially shortens the time to
steady-state levels of fulvestrant (shortened to
approximately 1 month vs 3 to 6 months with the
approved dose).71,73 Despite this, it remains unclear
whether use of the loading dose confers additional
clinical benefits. However, recent data from the NEWEST study were the first to demonstrate superior efficacy of high-dose fulvestrant (500-mg loading dose
followed by 500 mg per month) compared with the
approved dose (250 mg per month).74 That study
reported significant reductions in the Ki67 cell proliferation marker (P < .0001) and in ER expression (P <
.0003) in patients who received high-dose fulvestrant
compared with patients who received the approved
dose (P < .0001).75 In addition, the overall tumor
response rate at Week 4 of treatment was 17.4% in the
high-dose group and 11.8% in the low-dose group.76

Use of steroidal aromatase inhibitors after progression
on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors
A single-arm, phase 2 study demonstrated that exemestane had activity in patients with metastatic
breast cancer after failure of prior nonsteroidal AIs.77
Patients in that study received exemestane 25 mg per
day orally; at the time of disease progression, they
were offered dose escalation to exemestane 100 mg
per day. Among the 242 enrolled patients, the ORR
was 6.6%, 17.4% of patients had stable disease that
lasted 24 weeks, and there was an overall CBR of
24.3% for third-line or fourth-line exemestane.77
These data suggest, perhaps surprisingly, that exemestane has incomplete cross-resistance with nonsteroidal AIs. The efficacy of exemestane after failure
of a nonsteroidal AI also was supported in a retrospective study of 114 patients with metastatic breast
cancer.78 In that analysis, the CBR of exemestane
was 46% (33% in patients with visceral disease), and
the median progression-free survival and OS were
18 weeks and 61 weeks, respectively.
Low-dose and high-dose estradiol
Results of in vivo studies have demonstrated the intriguing antitumor potential of low-dose estradiol in
tamoxifen-stimulated tumors. Investigators led by V.
Craig Jordan developed an ovariectomized, athymic
nude mouse model with serial xenotransplants to
study exposure of breast cancer cells to 5 years of tamoxifen adjuvant therapy. By using this model, Jordan and collaborators observed that breast tumors
appear to cycle through different stages of hormone
dependency during the course of long-term tamoxifen exposure.79

During 1 of these stages, after stopping tamoxifen treatment, the administration of physiologic
doses of estradiol was tumoricidal, leading to a more
effective reduction in tumor size than that observed
with stopping tamoxifen alone. Later, some of the
breast cancer cells reverted to an estrogen-dependent
phenotype that, once again, was sensitive to tamoxifen inhibition. The authors proposed a cyclic model
of breast cancer hormone dependency and postulated that it may be possible to maintain patients
on tamoxifen therapy with intermittent estrogen
treatment.79
Further preclinical investigations by the same
laboratory led to the proposal of a cyclic clinical
therapeutic strategy of alternating treatment with tamoxifen, AIs, or fulvestrant with brief periods of lowdose estrogen to prevent the development of resistance and, thus, forestall the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy.80,81 Those authors identified 2 phases of
resistance: the first phase, in which the tumor has
become resistant to tamoxifen but is susceptible to
AIs or fulvestrant; and, after long-term tamoxifen
treatment, the second phase, in which the tumor
growth is stimulated by tamoxifen but inhibited by
estrogen.82 Clinical development of this strategy is
intriguing and would be served best by identification
and validation of biologic markers to distinguish
between first- and second-phase resistance. Limited
trials of estrogen treatment for advanced, resistant
breast malignancies currently are ongoing in the
clinic.83,84
It is noteworthy that updated analyses of an
early randomized trial of diethylstilbestrol (DES) (a
potent synthetic estrogen) versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer
revealed that long-term survival was significantly
better for women who received DES than for women
who received tamoxifen (35% for the DES arm vs
16% for the tamoxifen arm).85 The basis of this survival advantage is not known. Although tamoxifen
remains a preferred agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, that trial highlighted the finding
that high doses of estrogenic agents may have significant activity and may play a role in the treatment of
selected patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Progestins and androgens
Early studies demonstrated the comparable efficacy
of the progestin megestrol acetate and tamoxifen in
women with metastatic breast cancer.86 Subsequent
studies have focused on optimizing the dosing of
this agent in advanced breast cancer. Megestrol acetate still is used by many oncologists in this setting,
because it has demonstrated antitumor efficacy; and,

as a side effect, it stimulates appetite and causes
weight gain.87 Because of this history, additional progestin-based therapies are being evaluated. The 2
pathways for estrogen formation in breast tumors are
the aromatase pathway, which is targeted by AIs, and
the sulfatase pathway, which converts estrogen sulfate into estrone.88 Interest in new clinical applications of progestins may resurface because of
experimental evidence indicating high activity of sulfatase in breast cancer tumors (especially from hormone-dependent cell lines) and the possibility of
inhibiting this pathway with progestins. Results of
preclinical studies have indicated that certain progestins are strong inhibitors of sulfatase activity in hormone-dependent breast cancer cells. It also has been
noted that progestins inhibit 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase conversion of estrone to estradiol and
stimulate sulfotransferase synthesis of estrogen sulfate.88 Data from studies in humans are very limited.
Perhaps future clinical trials will determine whether
progestins, possibly in association with AIs, may
have a role in the treatment of hormone-sensitive
breast cancer. Additional studies suggest that progestins also may stimulate tumor progression by promoting the expression of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), which, in turn, acts to facilitate tumor-associated angiogenesis, underscoring the need
for more research in this area.89
Although some previous reports suggested a role
for androgen therapy in reducing breast cancer progression after failure on antiestrogen therapy, more
recent clinical trials have not demonstrated superiority of tamoxifen plus fluoxymesterone over tamoxifen
alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal
women with resected, early breast cancer with
known ER1 status.90 Androgens (ie, testosterone,
fluoxymesterone, testolactone, and calusterone) currently are used in some patients with advanced ER1
cancer and have been associated with responses and

symptom relief in approximately 20% of patients.
However, androgens are associated with a high rate
of adverse effects, including masculinization, hair
loss, increased libido, and edema.91

Future Directions
Combinations of endocrine therapies currently are
under investigation in an effort to improve treatment
strategies for postmenopausal patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (Table 2).72 The
Faslodex and Arimidex in Combination Trial and
Southwest Oncology Group Study S0226 are multicenter, phase 3 studies comparing single-agent
anastrozole with anastrozole plus fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with ER1/PR1 breast cancer that
recurs after the primary treatment of localized tumor.
The Study of Faslodex, Exemestane, and Arimidex Trial
is comparing fulvestrant monotherapy versus fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus exemestane monotherapy
in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer
that progressed on a non-steroidal AI.
Data from preclinical studies and from a few
clinical studies indicate that, as discussed above,
crosstalk between the ER and growth factor pathways, such as EGF, HER-2/neu, IGF-1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, is critical in developing
resistance to endocrine therapy.18,92 Studies also have
demonstrated that, in breast tumors, estrogens and
ERs can stimulate the enhanced expression or activation of key molecules involved in the regulation of
these pathways, which, in turn, can phosphorylate
and thus activate ERs in the absence of an estradiol
ligand, resulting in loss of estrogen dependence.37,43
The evidence that enhanced growth factor signal
transduction is a major factor in the development of
endocrine resistance suggests that combining signal
transduction inhibitors with endocrine therapy may
delay or supplant the emergence of this acquired
resistance.

Many studies are examining the effectiveness
and safety of combinations of hormone therapies
with signal transduction inhibitors to overcome endocrine resistance by targeting possible crosstalk
between the ER and growth factor signaling pathways (Table 3).72,93-95 Some of these combinations
involve tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inhibit EGFR
(gefitinib and erlotinib), VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
(cediranib), and PKCb mediated Akt signaling (enzastaurin) as well as multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib (inhibits c-Raf, b-Raf, KIT,
fms-related tyrosine kinase 2, VEGFR, and plateletderived growth factor receptor-b) and lapatinib (inhibits EGFR and HER-2/neu). Other combinations
involve monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, which targets VEGF, and trastuzumab, which
targets HER-2/neu. Potential trials of c-src kinase
inhibitors in combination with hormone therapy also
are under consideration.96 Ongoing clinical investigations will determine which of these hypothetical
combinations will translate to clinical benefits.
Clinical investigation of the potential role of ERb
in modulating breast cancer progression is in its initial stages. It has been established that ERb alters

ERa activity, and ERb and its splice variants, such as
ERb2/ERbcx, may have an impact on the responsiveness of breast tumors to hormone agents. Results of
recent retrospective studies suggest that tumor
expression of specific isoforms of ERb is associated
with clinical outcome of adjuvant endocrine treatment for primary breast cancer.24 Such work may
lead to new approaches in the management of HRpositive breast malignancies in the near future.
Although the optimal sequence of hormone
therapies remains to be determined in randomized,
controlled clinical trials, effective agents currently
exist that prolong life, reduce or postpone the need
for cytotoxic chemotherapy, and maintain QOL in
patients who have progressed on or become resistant
to initial hormone therapy. Experimental evidence
suggests the potential utility of sequencing or alternating various agents with different mechanisms of
action and proven efficacy and tolerability profiles to
extend the viability of hormone therapy in women
with metastatic breast cancer. However, clinical trials
need to be designed to test these strategies. Ongoing
investigation will explore further the clinical utility of
available hormone agents in combination with one

Hormone Resistance in the Clinic/Hurvitz and Pietras

another and in combination with novel, targeted
therapies in patients who fail on initial hormone
therapy.
