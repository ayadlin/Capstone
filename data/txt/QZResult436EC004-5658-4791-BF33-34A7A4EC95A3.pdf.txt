Abstract
Proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) is a sulfated glycoprotein
produced by cachexia-inducing tumors, which induces atrophy of skeletal muscle. PIF has been shown to bind specifically
with high affinity (K d, in nanomolar) to sarcolemma membranes from skeletal muscle of both the mouse and the pig, as
well as murine myoblasts and a human muscle cell line.
Ligand binding was abolished after enzymatic deglycosylation,
suggesting that binding was mediated through the oligosaccharide chains in PIF. Chondroitin sulfate, but not heparan or
dermatan sulfate, showed competitive inhibition (K d, 1.1 
107 mol/L) of binding of PIF to the receptor, suggesting an
interaction with the sulfated oligosaccharide chains. Ligand
blotting of [35S]PIF to triton solublized membranes from C2C12
cells provided evidence for a binding protein of apparent
M r of f40,000. Amino acid sequence analysis showed the PIF
receptor to be a DING protein. Antisera reactive to a 19mer
from the N-terminal amino acid residues of the binding
protein attenuated protein degradation and activation of the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway induced by PIF in murine
myotubes. In addition, the antisera was highly effective in
attenuating the decrease in body weight in mice bearing the
MAC16 tumor, with a significant increase in muscle wet weight
due to an increase in the rate of protein synthesis, together
with a reduction in protein degradation through attenuation
of the increased proteasome expression and activity. These
results confirm that the PIF binding protein has a functional
role in muscle protein atrophy in cachexia and that it
represents a potential new therapeutic target. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Many patients with cancer suffer a severe depletion of their
lean body mass, which has been linked with a reduced survival
time (1). A number of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factora (TNF-a; ref. 2), have been associated with protein depletion in
cachexia, but few studies have reported a direct effect on the
degradative process, although a combination of TNF-a with IFN-g
has been reported to strongly reduce myosin expression in
murine myotubes (3).
Unlike the cytokines, proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF) has been
reported to enhance protein degradation in skeletal muscle both
in vitro and in vivo (4). PIF was first detected in the urine of cancer
patients with weight loss and was shown to be homologous with a

material isolated from the cachexia-inducing murine tumor,
MAC16 (4). Subsequent studies (5) provided evidence that tumors
were the source of PIF in humans and that there was a correlation
between PIF expression in tumors, its detection in urine, and
weight loss. Although a recent study (6) was unable to find a
correlation between the presence of PIF in urine of patients with
metastatic gastric/esophageal cancer and weight loss, it is
questionable whether the investigators were measuring PIF,
because their Western blots showed bands at M r of 28,000 rather
than 24,000 reported for PIF (4). Also, whereas PIF has been
reported to comprise only 5 104% of the total urinary protein
(7), the band attributed to PIF in the mass spectrograph was a
major component compared with other studies (8), wherein the
band attributed to PIF was only a minor component in crude urine.
PIF induces specific depletion of the lean carcass mass through an
increase in protein degradation and a decrease in protein synthesis
in skeletal muscle (9). Recent studies (10) show that PIF acts
through the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) to both inhibit
protein synthesis and increase protein degradation in skeletal
muscle.
PIF is a highly sulfated glycoprotein, consisting of a short central
polypeptide chain of M r at 2,000 to 4,000, to which one 0-linked
sulfated oligosaccharide chain of M r at 6,000 and one N-linked
sulfated oligosaccharide chain of M r at 10,000 is attached (11). The
polypeptide chain is derived from the dermicidin gene (DCD), an
antimicrobial peptide isolated from human sweat (12). Another
peptide diffusible survival evasion peptide (or Y-P30) is a product of
the same region of DCD as the PIF core peptide (13), whereas
another peptide, which has been mapped to the DCD gene locus,
may function as an oncogene in breast cancer (14). Unlike PIF,
these peptides are not glycosylated. Both the N-linked and O-linked
oligosaccharide chains are important in the biological effects of
PIF (4, 11). Furthermore DCD expression does not seem sufficient
to induce cachexia (15). In this study, stable forced expression of
the gene for DCD resulted in secretion of a protein that was not
glycosylated. However, the antibody used for detection of
glycosylated PIF was raised to amino acids 44 to 62 of DCD, which
would be excised if it was glycosylated to form PIF. Also, to
consider that transfection with the DCD gene will necessarily lead
to increased synthesis of PIF is questionable, because PIF is a
highly complex sulfated glycoprotein, with 85% of the mass being
complex carbohydrate, which requires the presence of both the
glycosylated sugars and the relevant conjugating enzymes.
Although the PIF core peptide mRNA expression is up-regulated
in both tumor and adjacent normal tissue in gastroesophageal
malignancy, this does not relate to prognosis or cachexia (16). This
confirms that posttranslational modification of the core peptide is
important to the biological effects of PIF.
Because PIF is highly negatively charged, it is unlikely to enter
cells, suggesting that it must exert its effects through interaction
with a membrane receptor, which in turn is linked to activation of
cellular signaling pathways, such as activation of PKR (10). Because

the sulfated oligosaccharide chains are required for biological
activity, binding could be mediated through a salt linkage between
the sulfate groups on PIF and basic residues on proteins in a
putative receptor. The present study reports on the isolation of a
membrane receptor for PIF on skeletal muscle, which has a high
affinity and which seems to be linked to functional activity.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and horse serum, together with
RPMI 1640 and DMEM, were purchased from Life Technologies. MAC16
monoclonal antibody was isolated from the culture medium of a hybridoma cell line (17) using a protein A–Sepharose column. L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine (specific activity, 54 Ci mmol1), Na35
2 SO4 (specific activity, 10–100
Ci mmol1), Na125I (specific activity, 17.4 Ci Ag1), hybond A nitrocellulose
membranes, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) development kits
were purchased from Amersham Biosciences Ltd. All chemicals, including
lectin-agarose from Triticum vulgaris were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
Optiphase Hisafe 3 scintillation fluid was supplied by Fisons. Mouse
monoclonal antibodies to 20S proteasome a-subunits and MSS1 were from
Affiniti Research Products, whereas mouse monoclonal antibody to myosin
heavy chain was from Novocastra. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody were
purchased from Dako Ltd.
Cell culture and tumor propagation. The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell
line was grown in DMEM supplemented with 12% FBS in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37jC. All experiments with myoblasts were
performed on cells in the subconfluent state. Myotubes were formed by
replacement of the growth medium of the myoblasts when they reached
confluence with DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum. Differentiation
was complete within 3 to 5 days. MAC16 cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 containing 5% FBS at 37jC under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Normal human muscle cells Hs94MU were obtained from the European
Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in DMEM containing
2 mmol/L glutamine and 10% FBS under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
air. For biosynthetic labeling, the cell suspension contained Na35
2 SO4
(1 ACi mL1) for 48 h in RPMI 1640 containing 1.5% dialyzed FBS (11).
Pure strain NMRI mice, bred in our own colony, were implanted in the
flank with fragments of the MAC16 tumor, as described (18). Weight loss
was evident 10 to 12 days after tumor transplantation. Fragments of the
MAC13 tumor were implanted by the same procedure. This tumor produces
no weight loss during growth. Animals bearing the MAC16 tumor were
entered into the study when they had lost f5% of their starting body
weight. Animals were randomized into groups of five to receive either antiPIF receptor rabbit IgG (4 mg/kg) daily by i.p. injection, whereas control
animals received rabbit anti-goat antiserum at the same concentration.
Both tumor volume and body weight were monitored daily. Animals were
terminated by cervical dislocation when the body weight loss reached 20%,
and all animal experiments followed a strict protocol approved by the
British Home Office and the ethical guidelines that were followed met the
standards required by the U.K. Coordinating Committee on Cancer
Research guidelines (19). After termination, the soleus and gastrocnemius
muscles were quickly dissected out and used for the determination of
protein synthesis and degradation.
Protein synthesis and degradation in muscle. Protein synthesis was
measured by the incorporation of L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine into acid
insoluble material of soleus muscle during a 2-h period as described (20).
The rate of protein synthesis was calculated by dividing the amount of
protein-bound radioactivity by the amount of acid-soluble radioactivity.
For protein breakdown, gastrocnemius muscle was incubated in 3 mL
Krebs-Henselit buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmol/L glucose and 0.5 mmol/L
cycloheximide and gassed with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. The rate
of protein degradation was determined by measuring the release of tyrosine
(21) over a 2-h period.
Purification of labeled PIF. Labeled PIF was purified from MAC16 cells
as previously described (11) using affinity chromatography to a monoclonal

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

antibody which recognizes the glycosylated chains of PIF (17). Further
purification was achieved by hydrophobic chromatography using a
Brownlee Aquopore RP-300 C8 column and an acetonitrile in water
gradient as described (4, 17). Material eluting at 55% acetonitrile was
concentrated against water using an Amicon filtration cell containing a
membrane filter with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000. For [125I]-labeled
PIF, nonlabeled PIF was isolated from solid MAC16 tumors as described
above and iodinated using Na125I as described (4).
Membrane isolations. Sarcolemma membranes were prepared from
gastrocnemius muscle of mice bearing either the MAC16 or MAC13 tumor
essentially as described (22). Sarcolemma membranes from pig muscle were
prepared by the same procedure and kindly donated by Dr V. Baracos
(University of Alberta).
For C2C12 cells, homogenization was carried out in 20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), and 1 mmol/L DTT at 4jC. The homogenate was centrifuged at
20,000 rpm for 30 min and washed with the same buffer. The pellet was used
for binding studies. Adipocyte plasma membranes were prepared from
adipocytes from epididymal adipose tissue of male BKW mice by a
modification of the protocol of Belsham et al. (23). Essentially, plasma
membranes were isolated from other components of a cell homogenate
using a self-forming Percoll gradient. The membrane fractions were washed
in a NaCl buffer diluted in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/L
sucrose, 2 mmol/L EGTA, and 4 Amol/L PMSF at 1 to 2 mg mL1, snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70jC until use. Hepatocyte plasma
membranes were purified by a scheme similar to that for adipocytes (23),
which had been modified for hepatocytes (24).
Binding studies. Membranes (200 Ag protein suspended in 200 AL PBS)
were incubated for 24 h at 4jC with various concentrations of [35S]PIF in
50 AL PBS as detailed in the figure legends. Bound and free radioactivity was
separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000g. The binding curves were
fitted to one-site and two-site hyperbolae using Graphpad PRISM v4 to
obtain estimates of K d and maximum number of binding sites (B max). An
F test was used to decide which of the models was most appropriate.
Isolation of the PIF receptor. C2C12 membranes, prepared as above,
were solubilized in 1% Triton for 30 min and then dialysed against PBS
overnight at 4jC. An aliquot (200 AL) of the dialysed sample was incubated
with [35S]PIF for 24 h in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the PIF
receptor was purified by lectin chromatography or wheat germ agglutinin
(WGA) agarose, which uses the observation (17) that this lectin will bind
the oligosaccharide chains of PIF. The column (1 mL bed volume; 10 mg
WGA mL1) was loaded with sample and washed with 20 volumes of wash
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% NaN3]. Elution of the
receptor was accomplished with 10 volumes of 0.1 mol/L N-acetylglucosamine in wash buffer. Fractions (1 mL) were collected and stored at 4jC in
the presence of protease inhibitors. The radioactive fractions were
concentrated using a Microcon microconcentrator containing a membrane
filter, with a molecular weight cutoff of M r at 10,000 (Amicon) and used for
further analysis.
Determination of affinity constant (K aff ) of PIF for monoclonal
antibody. Monoclonal antibody was purified from the tissue culture
supernatant of a hybridoma as described (17) using a protein A column.
Serial dilutions of the antibody were made in the dilutent 0.25 mol/L TrisHCl (pH 8.5) with 2% calf serum and 1% Tween 20 to a final dilution factor
of 104 to 105. PIF was iodinated as described (4) and diluted in the above
dilutent, such that 50 AL contained 2  104 cpm. The diluted monoclonal
antibody (100 AL) was dispensed into tubes followed by [125I]PIF (50 AL),
and the tubes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then protein
A–Sepharose (100 AL) was added, and the tubes were shaken for a further
2 h. Dilutent (3 mL) was added and the tubes were centrifuged, decanted,
and washed with another 3 mL of dilutent. The final sedimented solid phase
was counted in a Gamma counter. The antibody concentration at halfmaximal binding is a measure of affinity.
Competitive binding of [35S]PIF. C2C12 membranes (200 Ag) in PBS
(250 AL) were incubated with 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 ng of either
monoclonal antibody, chondroitin, dermatan, or heparin sulfate and
20 nmol/L (480 ng) of [35S]PIF overnight at 4jC. The bound radioactivity

was determined from the radioactivity in the pellet obtained by
centrifugation at 13,000g for 5 min.
The K aff was determined according to a modification (25) of the method
of Muller (26).

(K d, 1.5 F 0.4 nmol/L) and liver (K d, 0.9 F 0.2 nmol/L), but there
was no evidence of binding in kidney or adipose tissue. There was
no evidence for up-regulation of receptor number in mice bearing
the MAC16 tumor with cachexia.

wherein I t is the inhibitor concentration at 50% inhibition of PIF binding, T t
is the total PIF concentration, and b is the fraction of PIF bound in the
absence of inhibitor.
Measurement of protein breakdown in vitro. Protein degradation in
myotubes was determined by the release of L-[2,6-3H]phenylalanine from
cells prelabeled for 24 h as described previously (27). PIF was added at the
concentrations indicated in the figure legends, and protein degradation was
determined after a further 24 h in the presence of 2 mmol/L nonlabeled
phenylalanine to prevent reincorporation. The rate of proteolysis was
calculated by dividing the radioactivity released into the incubation
medium by the protein-bound radioactivity.
Measurement of proteasome activity. Proteasome activity was
determined fluorimetrically as the ‘‘chymotrypsin-like’’ enzyme activity by
determining the release of aminomethyl courmarin (AMC) from the
fluorogenic peptide succinyl-LLVY-AMC as described (27). Activity was
measured in the absence and presence of the specific proteasome inhibitor
lactacystin (10 Amol/L). Only lactacystin-suppressible activity was considered to be proteasome specific.
Production of antisera to the PIF receptor. This was produced by
Severn Biotech Ltd. by conjugating the 19mer peptide (5 mg) to 5 mg
PPD (as carrier protein) with sulfo-SMCC through a C-terminal cysteine
and subsequently immunizing two rabbits by s.c. injection of this antigen
(50–200 mg) at 0.25 mL at each of four sites in Freud’s adjuvant. The
antibody was purified from the antisera by adding 50% saturated
ammonium sulfate, followed by protein-A column chromatography
(PURE1A kit, Sigma Aldrich). The antibody titer of the purified IgG was
39.5 mg mL1 specific to the synthetic PIF receptor peptide.
Western blotting. Samples of cytosolic protein (5 Ag) formed by
centrifugation of cellular homogenates at 18,000g for 10 min at 4jC were
resolved on 12% SDS/PAGE gels and transferred to 0.45-Am nitrocellulose
membranes, which had been blocked with 5% Marvel in TBS (pH 7.5) at 4jC
overnight. The primary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 except
for actin (1:250) and myosin (1:100). The secondary antibodies were also
used at a concentration of 1:1,000. Incubation was for 1 h at room
temperature, after which the secondary antibody was washed off, and the
blots were developed using ECL. Blots were scanned with a densitometer to
quantitate differences.
Statistical analysis. Results are presented as mean F SE. Differences in
means between groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. P values of <0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Binding studies have been conducted using [35S]PIF obtained by
biosynthetically labeling MAC16 cells. The radioligand was purified
from cell supernatants using a combination of affinity chromatography, followed by reverse phase high performance liquid
chromatography on a C8 column as previously reported (3, 5). To
determine whether a specific binding protein exists, ligand binding
studies were performed using membranes isolated from the
muscles of mice, pig, and human (Fig. 1). For murine myoblasts
and the pig, the binding data best fitted a two-site hyperbola,
although the second site in myoblasts was of low affinity and
probably represented nonspecific binding. In all other cases, the
data best fitted a one-site model. The K d and B max values presented
in Fig. 1 show evidence of a high-affinity binding site (K d, 1-26
nmol/L), which was also detected on mouse skeletal muscle

Figure 2. A, percentage binding of [125I]PIF (20 nmol/L) at various concentrations of monoclonal antibody. The K aff was calculated from half-maximal PIF binding.

inhibition of PIF binding to C2C12 membranes by chondroitin sulfate (D). The experiment was repeated thrice.

We have previously reported (11) that the biological activity of
PIF is destroyed when the N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide
chains are removed by incubation with peptide N-glycosidaseF
(PNGaseF) or endo-a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (O-glycosidase).
To determine the effect of deglycosylation of PIF on binding to the
receptor, experiments were conducted with peptide-labeled PIF
generated by incubating MAC16 cells with L-[2, 5-3H]histidine (11).
After 24-h incubation with PNGaseF or O-glycosidase binding of
[3H]PIF was substantially reduced (Fig. 1D), with only nonspecific
binding of the labeled polypeptide chain to the membrane.
The affinity of binding of PIF to monoclonal antibody [K aff,
108 (mol/L)1] was found to be less than binding to either highaffinity or low-affinity sites on the muscle receptor (Fig. 2A).
However, when the monoclonal antibody was added to C2C12 membranes at concentrations between 1 and 1,000 ng/250 AL, binding
to the receptor was effectively inhibited (K d, 1.4  108 mol/L;
Fig. 2B). The monoclonal antibody was less effective at competing

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

with membrane receptors for PIF when added after PIF (K d, 5.8 
107 mol/L; Fig. 2C).
Although PIF is a glycoprotein, the oligosaccharide chains have
some similarity to a proteoglycan because chondroitinase avidinbiotin complex method destroys the antigenic determinants (11).
This suggests that binding of PIF to the receptor may be attenuated
by proteoglycans binding to the same site. To investigate this, the
effect of chondroitin, dermatan, and heparan sulfate at concentrations between 5 and 5,000 ng per assay on the binding of PIF to
receptors on C2C12 membranes has been determined. Of the three
proteoglycans, only chondroitin sulfate showed competitive
inhibition of binding (Fig. 2D) with K d of 1.1  107 mol/L.
Ligand blotting of [35S]PIF to triton solubilized membranes from
C2C12 cells electrophoresed in 15% SDS/PAGE and transferred
electrophoretically to nitrocellulose filters provided evidence for
two binding proteins with apparent M r of 38,000 and 40,000
(Fig. 3A). Increasing concentrations of nonlabeled PIF were capable

of displacing radioactivity from the binding proteins (Fig. 3B),
confirming that binding to the receptor was specific. The analysis
of this binding is shown in Fig. 1A.
The PIF-receptor complex was isolated from crude membrane
preparations of murine myotubes using the lectin-binding properties of the oligosaccharide chains in PIF to T. vulgaris WGA (17).
This effectively isolated the receptor predominantly as a single
protein of M r at 40,000 (Fig. 3C). Control incubations in which
solubilized membranes isolated from myotubes were subjected to
lectin affinity chromatography on WGA without prior incubation
with PIF showed no retention of a similar protein confirming that
the M r at 40,000 material is not an endogenous glycoprotein.
Separate experiments confirmed that the M r at 40,000 material was
not glycosylated, and Edman degradation analysis gave the
sequence for the N-terminal amino acid residues shown below:
DINGGGATLPQKLYLIPNVL
. Polyclonal antisera was generated in rabbits to a peptide derived
from the first 19 amino acids of the N-terminal peptide sequence of
the receptor. Using protein A–purified antisera, Western blotting
detected a single band corresponding to a material or M r of 40,000,
both in WGA-purified and crude membrane preparations (Fig. 4A).
The effect of addition of the antisera at concentrations between
5 and 20 Ag/mL on total protein degradation induced by PIF in
murine myotubes is shown in Fig. 4B. The concentration-response
curve for PIF followed a bell-shaped curve, as previously reported
(10, 27), with a maximum effect at 4.2 nmol/L, which is close to the
binding affinity of PIF in this cell line. Partial attenuation of the
effect of PIF was seen when the antisera was added at a
concentration of 5 Ag/mL, with complete attenuation at concentrations of 10 Ag/mL or higher. Because protein degradation by PIF
is mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28), the
effect of the anti-PIF antisera on both proteasome functional
activity, as determined by the chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity
(Fig. 4C), as well as expression of the 20S proteasome a-subunits
(Fig. 4D), was determined. As with total protein degradation
preincubation with the antireceptor, antiserum at concentrations of
10 Ag/mL or higher completely attenuated the PIF-induced
increased in chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity (Fig. 4C) and 20S
proteasome a-subunits (Fig. 4D). Control experiments using a
nonspecific rabbit antiserum showed that the effect was specific to
the anti-PIF receptor antisera. These results confirm that antibodies
to the isolated PIF receptor can attenuate the action of PIF in vitro.
To determine the effect of the antisera on the development of
cachexia in vivo, mice bearing the MAC16 tumor, and with
established weight loss (average, 5.4%), were treated daily with the
anti-PIF receptor antibody (4 mg/kg), and the effect on body
weight, tumor growth, and muscle mass was determined. Control
animals received a rabbit anti-goat antibody at the same
concentration. After 3 days of treatment, there was a significant
reduction in the rate of weight loss of animals receiving the
antireceptor antibody compared with those receiving the control
antibody (Fig. 5A). There was no significant effect of the antibody
on tumor growth rate (Fig. 5B). Animals receiving the antireceptor
antibody showed a significant increase in the weight of soleus
muscles compared with the antibody control, and this was not
significantly different from weight-matched NMRI mice without
tumor (Fig. 5C). Muscle mass was increased in mice treated with
the antireceptor antiserum due to a significant increase in protein
synthesis (Fig. 5D) and attenuation of the increased protein
degradation down to levels found in nontumor-bearing mice

protein were loaded into each well of a 15% SDS/PAGE. Samples were

had been preblocked overnight in blocking buffer (5% Marvel in PBS containing
0.1% Tween 20). The filters were cut into individual lanes and blotted with
increasing concentrations of [35S]PIF in blocking buffer for 2 h at room
temperature. The filter was washed thrice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween
20, air dried, reassembled, and processed for autoradiography. The 40-kDa

and 10) in the absence (lanes 1–5 ; n) or presence (lanes 6–10 ; 5) of the anti-PIF receptor IgG (10 Ag mL1). The densitometric analysis is the average of
three separate Western blots. Differences from control are P < 0.01 (b) or P < 0.001 (c ), whereas differences in the presence of the anti-PIF receptor IgG are
P < 0.05 (d), P < 0.01 (e), or P < 0.001 (f ).

(Fig. 6A). Functional proteasome activity, as measured by the
chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity (Fig. 6B), as well as expression
of MSS1, an ATPase subunit of the 19S regulator of the proteasome,
were also attenuated down to the levels found in nontumor-bearing
animals (Fig. 6C), whereas myosin levels were restored (Fig. 6D).
These results support a role for PIF in the induction of muscle
atrophy in mice bearing the MAC16 tumor, and suggest that an
anti-PIF receptor antibody could be used therapeutically for the
treatment of cachexia.

Discussion
For PIF to induce protein degradation in skeletal muscle, there
must be a specific interaction with a receptor capable of translating
the message into activation of the intracellular protein degradative
system. Because PIF is a highly glycosylated and sulfated
glycoprotein (11), it is likely that this will be membrane bound.
The results of the present study provide evidence for specific, highaffinity binding sites for PIF in muscle cells. The affinity of binding
was comparable with that found for insulin (29) and showed

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

10-fold to 100-fold greater affinity than binding to a monoclonal
antibody, which has been used in the purification of PIF (17).
However, high concentrations of the antibody were capable of
displacing PIF from the membrane receptor. This would explain
why high concentrations of the antibody were required to
neutralize the biological effect of PIF (4, 17). As with binding of
PIF to the antibody (11), binding to the receptor is probably
mediated through the sulfated oligosaccharide chains, because
binding was specifically inhibited by chondroitin sulfate but not
by the related proteoglycans dermatan and heparan sulfate. In
addition enzymatic deglycosylation resulted in the loss of specific
binding of PIF to the receptor, as it has also been shown to destroy
biological activity (4). The high-affinity binding probably results
from electrostatic interaction between PIF and the receptor.
A plot of binding of PIF to muscle membranes from C2C12 cells
and pig provided evidence for two binding sites, although in
human and mouse muscle and mouse liver the data fitted to a
single site model. Ligand blotting of [35S]PIF to triton solubilized
membranes from C2C12 cells electrophoresed in 15% SDS/PAGE

Receptor Binding Studies with PIF

provided evidence for two binding proteins of apparent M r at
38,000 and 40,000. Two site models of steady-state binding have
been described for a number of hormonal and nonhormonal
systems. For insulin, this has been shown (30, 31) to represent
negative cooperativity in the binding sites. This provides a
mechanism in which binding to the receptor is favored at low
concentrations of the hormone, but becomes more difficult as the
concentration of the hormone is increased. Such an effect is
apparent for protein degradation in C2C12 cells induced by PIF,
wherein a bell-similar dose-response curve was observed. Previous
studies (9) have reported similar dose-response curves for protein
degradation in isolated soleus and gastrocnemius muscles induced
by PIF, as well as in murine myotubes (10, 27). These results suggest
negative cooperative interactions between the PIF binding sites.
We have confirmed that PIF is responsible for the loss of skeletal
muscle in mice bearing the MAC16 tumor with cachexia (32).
However, the number of binding sites for PIF in skeletal muscle
was comparable in mice bearing the MAC16 tumor and the MAC13
tumor, which does not induce cachexia, suggesting that the
induction of muscle protein degradation during the process of
cachexia is not due to the up-regulation of receptors but related to
the production of PIF by the tumor (4, 5), which leads to
constitutive activation of muscle protein degradation.
The distribution of the PIF receptor in tissues is commensurate
with a role of PIF in mediating catabolism of skeletal muscle
proteins. Protein degradation rates in C2C12 myotubes were shown

to increase by 50% to 90% in response to PIF, with maximal
stimulation at a concentration of 4.2 nmol/L, which is close to the
binding affinity of PIF to the receptor. The role of PIF receptors in
the liver is probably related to its ability to increase production of
IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein through activation of the
transcription factors nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (33). Induction of the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by PIF in murine myotubes is also
mediated through activation of NF-nB (27). This suggests that the
PIF receptor is linked to an intracellular signaling pathway leading
to activation of NF-nB in both muscle and liver.
We have used the lectin binding properties of PIF, which binds
through N-acetylglucosamine residues to the lectin from T. vulgaris
(WGA; ref. 17), to isolate the PIF-receptor complex. Although initial
ligand binding studies suggested that there may be two proteins to
which PIF binds, the isolated protein migrated as a single band on
SDS/PAGE and gave an amino acid sequence analysis commensurate with it being a DING protein. DING proteins have been
isolated from bacteria, plants, and animals, and have a highly
conserved structure with 80% to 90% sequence identity in the
N-terminal 25 to 30 amino acid residues (34). Most of these proteins
have an M r of f40,000, as observed with the PIF receptor, and
most have been identified in extracellular or cell surface locations
rather than in cytoplasmic extracts. As yet, no cDNA or genomic
DING sequences have been published. This has been suggested (34)
to be due to a low transcript abundance, mRNA instability, rapid

turnover, or by gaps in the human genome. However, it has been
suggested (35) that DING proteins do not exist in eukaryotic cells
and that all sequences are of Pseudomonas origin due to microbial
contamination. This is unlikely to be the case in the present
investigation, because the murine myotubes were completely free of
gross microbiological contamination and no Pseudomonas could be
grown either from the PIF preparations or the purified receptor.
Furthermore, membrane preparations did not show the DING
protein in the absence of PIF, confirming that it was isolated from
the membrane after binding to PIF.
Further evidence for a role of the DING protein in a eukaryotic
system comes from studies with a polyclonal antisera to the Nterminal region of the protein. Purified IgG from this antiserum
completely attenuated the effect of PIF on protein degradation in
murine myotubes, as well as attenuating the development of
cachexia in mice bearing the MAC16 tumor. Muscle mass was
increased due to a significant increase in protein synthesis,
whereas protein degradation was reduced down to levels found
in nontumor-bearing animals. The anti-PIF IgG was effective in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

attenuating up-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
induced both by PIF and the MAC16 tumor. These results suggest
that the antibody binds to the PIF receptor on skeletal muscle,
blocking the interaction with PIF, which would initiate the
inhibition of protein synthesis and increase in protein degradation.
These results suggest that antagonists of the binding of PIF to its
receptor may be useful in the treatment of muscle wasting in
cancer cachexia. The binding affinity for PIF and molecular weight
of the receptor seem to be similar in mouse, pig, and man,
suggesting that this approach would also be appropriate for the
treatment of human cachexia.
