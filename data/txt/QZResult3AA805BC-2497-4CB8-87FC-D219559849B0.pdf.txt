Abstract
Gut microbiota plays a dual role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is closely
linked to production of uremic toxins. Strategies of reducing uremic toxins by
targeting gut microbiota are emerging. It is known that Chinese medicine rhubarb
enema can reduce uremic toxins and improve renal function. However, it remains
unknown which ingredient or mechanism mediates its effect. Here we utilized a rat
CKD model of 5/6 nephrectomy to evaluate the effect of emodin, a main ingredient
of rhubarb, on gut microbiota and uremic toxins in CKD. Emodin was administered
via colonic irrigation at 5ml (1mg/day) for four weeks. We found that emodin via
colonic irrigation (ECI) altered levels of two important uremic toxins, urea and indoxyl
sulfate (IS), and changed gut microbiota in rats with CKD. ECI remarkably reduced
urea and IS and improved renal function. Pyrosequencing and Real-Time qPCR
analyses revealed that ECI resumed the microbial balance from an abnormal status
in CKD. We also demonstrated that ten genera were positively correlated with Urea
while four genera exhibited the negative correlation. Moreover, three genera were
positively correlated with IS. Therefore, emodin altered the gut microbiota structure.
It reduced the number of harmful bacteria, such as Clostridium spp. that is positively
correlated with both urea and IS, but augmented the number of beneficial bacteria,
including Lactobacillus spp. that is negatively correlated with urea. Thus, changes in
gut microbiota induced by emodin via colonic irrigation are closely associated with
reduction in uremic toxins and mitigation of renal injury.

Introduction

derived from the bacterial metabolites, which can
contribute to uremic toxins, including indoxyl sulfate
(IS), through the gut-kidney axis [4, 5]. IS that originates
from the gut microbiota fermentation turns out to be an
independent risky factor for CKD and cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) [6]. On the other hand, previous studies
have suggested that gut microbiota are altered under CKD
state and that this dysbiosis in turn contributes to the

Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) have a complicated
etiology and pathology and the mechanisms underlying
their pathogenesis remain unclear. Uremic toxins promote
progression of CKD with complications [1-3]. Mounting
evidence has shown that uremic retention solutes originate
from colonic microbial metabolisms, such as indoleamines

progression of CKD [7, 8]. Recent studies have revealed
some effective treatments of the CKD with altering uremic
toxins and gut microbiota through targeting the colonic
environment, including oral administration of AST-120 to
adsorb uremic toxins [9], and prebiotics or probiotics to
modulate gut microbiota [8, 10]. However, the relevance
of gut microbiota to CKD and uremic toxins is not well
understood.
Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone)
is a naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the roots
and barks of numerous plants [11, 12], and especially,
an important active ingredient of Chinese herb Rhubarb
(Da Huang) [13]. Emodin is laxative, antibacterial,
immunosuppressive, and diuretic [14-17]. It is often used
for the treatment of constipation. Previous researches
have also shown that emodin glycoside is cleaved by
the intestinal bacteria to release emodin, which in turn
activates the underlying smooth muscle cells, leading to
muscle contraction. It also inhibits the activity of KATP
channel and the ion transport (chloride) across colon
cells [18] due to its laxative effect. Rhubarb, a laxative
Chinese medical herb since ancient time, has been widely
used to reduce uremic toxins for the treatment of CKD
in China [19, 20]. But it has been used more often via
colonic administration than via oral administration since
early 1950s [21]. Our previous studies have demonstrated
that rhubarb-based decoction enema reduces the uremic
toxins, including urea, creatinine and IS, preserves the
renal function and help patients avoid the dialysis [22].
But mechanisms underlying its effects are not understood.
We speculated that treatments with rhubarb via colonic
route modulate the multiple targets on gut microbiota
and metabolic toxins through the gut-kidney axis to
improve the renal function. Here, we examined structural
alterations of gut microbiota and levels of uremic toxins
in response to emodin colonic irrigation (ECI). We found
that ECI markedly reduced the levels of uremic toxins,
including urea and IS, and modulated the gut microbiota.
In particular, ECI reduced the number of harmful bacteria,
such as Clostridium spp. but increased the number of

beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus spp.

Results
Kidney function is improved by ECI
Data are summarized in Table 1. Compared with
the sham-operation control group (CTL), CKD groups
with either emodin colonic irrigation (ECI) or control
colonic irrigation (CCI) showed a significant increase
in creatinine and urea concentrations as well as urinary
protein excretion, but an decrease in hemoglobin and
hematocrit levels, creatinine clearance and body weight.
Then compared with CCI control groups, ECI significantly
lowered urea concentrations and urinary protein excretion,
slightly reduced creatinine without statistic significance,
improved creatinine clearance and body weight, and
increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

ECI significantly reduced uremic toxin IS
After the treatments for 4 weeks, the serum samples
were analyzed by HPLC-MS, as shown in Figure 1.
When compared with the control (CTL), experimental
groups with 5/6 nephrectomy and CCI control exhibited
a significant increase in the IS levels (4.13±0.52 vs
1.45±0.36 μg/mL; p < 0.01). However, ECI treatments
significantly reduced its level compared with CCI control
(1.97±0.64 vs 4.13±0.52 μg/mL; p < 0.01). There was
no statistical difference between CTL controls and ECI
groups.

The dominant fecal microbiota changes with ECI
The dominant fecal microbiota were profiled
by real-time qPCR. There was no significant change
with total numbers of all bacteria among all groups.

Key microbiota changes following ECI and its
association with uremic toxins including urea and
IS

Compared with the CTL group, Clostridium Perfringens
(C. perfringens) in experimental CCI control group was
increased significantly, whereas the Lactobacillus was
significantly decreased. Moreover, compared with the CCI
control group, Lactobacillus in ECI group was remarkably
increased whereas Enteroroccus, Escherichia coli (E. coli)
and C. perfringens in ECI group was significantly reduced.
Finally, Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) did not change
among all groups (Table 2 and Figure 2).

In this study, we provided a broad view of the gut
microbiota. A total of 8 phyla, 12 classes, 13 orders, 32
families, and 47 genera were represented. At the phylum
level, the most abundant were Bacteroidetes (51.1% counts
in CCI control group, 43.2% in ECI group and 53.7%
counts in CTL control group), Firmicutes (45.4%counts in
CCI control group, 48.3% in ECI group and 43.1%counts
in CTL control group), Tenericutes (2.0%counts in CCI
control group, 4.7% in ECI group and 1.8%counts in
CTL control group), and Proteobacteria (0.7%counts in
CIC control group, 1.3% in ECI group and 0.7%counts in
CTL control group) (Figure 4A). The four phyla were the
predominant ones constituting 98.6% of total microbiota.
As described in other studies [7, 23, 24], Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla were consistently
present with the greatest numbers. But in our study,
Tenericutes was also very abundant and significantly
increased in ECI group compared with CCI control
or CTL control group (P < 0.05), while there was no
difference in other three phyla between all groups. The
phyla of Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes were only found
in ECI group with 0.1% counts for both. The remaining
bacteria belonged to the Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres,
Elusimicrobia, Lentisphaerae, Spirochaetes and
Verrucomicrobia with less than 0.5% counts.
At the genus level, there was a difference in
47 genera (Figure 4B), with 3 genera found only in
CTL group, 6 genera only in CCI control group, and
3 genera only in ECI group. Among all genera, the
genera from the families of Prevotellaceae, S24-7,
Bacteroidaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, Lactobacillaceae,
Ruminococcaceaeha, Lachnospiraceae and unclassified
Clostridiales order were dominant. The five classified
genera
(Bacteroides,
Prevotella,
Lactobacillus,
Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus) were most abundant
in each group. Meanwhile, compared with the CTL,
Lactobacillus was decreased significantly in CCI control
group while genera of Ruminococcus, Clostridium
and unclassified genus from Ruminococcaceae family,
which were all from Clostridiales order, were increased
in CCI control group. Then compared with CCI control
group, the unclassified genera from S24-7 family and

Overall structural changes of gut microbiota after
ECI treatments
Using a bar-coded pyrosequencing of V3-V5 region
of 16S rRNA genes of 128,238 valid reads in the three
groups from 31 samples, we got total 3,744 operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) with an average of 488 OTUs
per sample (±120 sd.). The Venn diagram determined the
shared and unique OTUs that some different structures
were showed in each group (Supplementary Figure S1).
The rarefaction curves and the alpha diversity analysis
have shown the most characters of the samples, with
most diversities being captured (Supplementary Figure S2
and Table S1). Weighted and unweighted UniFrac PCoA
analysis revealed that the gut microbiota structure of the
three groups exhibited a deviation away from one another
(Figure 3).

is to slow the progression of kidney failure or to finally
replace kidney function with dialysis or a transplant.
But, it has been difficult to reduce uremic toxins using
western medicines. Unfortunately, dialysis causes many
complications in CKD patients and lowers their quality
of life. Kidney transplantation is also limited due to
insufficient donors. Recently emerging are new approaches
to treating uremia and preserving kidney function using
Chinese medicine enema. For instance, rhubarb enema
is one of the most important Chinese medicines for the
treatment of various diseases. It is widely used to clear
away uremic toxins and improve the uremic symptoms
in China [21]. The current study demonstrated that
ECI reduced the accumulation of uremic toxins urea
and IS, which was consistent with our previous clinical
observation [22]. Moreover, it also remarkably reduced the
urinary protein excretion, suggesting that ECI slows the
progression of kidney failure.
As a uremic toxin, IS is derived from gut microbial
metabolism [25] and associated with progression of CKD
and mortality [26]. When proteins are not digested in
the gastrointestinal tract, fermentation of the amino acid
tryptophan by intestinal microbiota generates indoles,
which are further hydroxylated into 3-hydroxy-indole to
generate IS. The latter circulates in equilibrium between
a free solute fraction and a fraction bound to serum
proteins to damage kidney function [5]. Urea, another
important uremic toxin, is also associated with colonic
environment where it is hydrolyzed by microbial urease
to form ammonia [CO(NH2)2+H2O→CO2+2NH3], and
it is a likely mediator that alters gut microbiota [27, 28].
These two uremic toxins damage intestinal barrier, leading
to systemic inflammation with injured kidney functions
[29]. The decrease in these uremic toxins and changes of
gut microbiota after ECI treatments in this study suggest
that gut microbiota is correlated with the uremic toxins.
Gut microbiota, mainly residing in the colon as

Clostridium were remarkably decreased in ECI group,
whereas Bacteroides and unclassified genus from RF39
order were markedly increased in ECI group with a
slight improvement of the Lactobacillus also in ECI
group without statistical significance. Among all genera
observed, only Adlercreutzia, Bacteroides, unclassified
genera from RF39 order and Ruminococcaceae family
were significantly increased in ECI group compared with
CTL control group.
Using redundancy analyses, we chose 56 core
genera that responded to ECI treatments (Figure 5).
We found that 10 genera (unclassified S24-7 family,
unclassified Paraprevotellaceaea family, Ruminococcus,
Clostridium, Elusimicrobium, Roseburia, Allobaculum,
Epulopiscium, and Christensenella) exhibited a significant
positive correlation with Urea, while 4 genera (Prevotella,
Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Helicobacter) had
a significant negative correlation with Urea. 3 genera
(unclassified Paraprevotellaceae family, Clostridium and
Allobaculum) showed a significant positive correlation
with IS, but no genus had a significant negative correlation
with IS. The genus of Streptococcus trended to have a
negative correlation with IS (Figure 6). Bifidobacterium
genus was undetectable in all groups.

Discussion
In this study, we sought to understand the
mechanisms by which ECI improves renal function by
focusing on the change of gut microbiota resulted from
ECI intervention since gut microbiota has been shown
to play a role in the generation of uremic toxins [4, 5].
We found that ECI markedly reduced the levels of uremic
toxins, including urea and IS, and modulated the gut
microbiota.
Uremia is largely due to the accumulation of
organic waste products. At present, a treatment of uremia

a forgotten “big organ” [30], has approximately 500
different bacterial species and 1014 cells that is 10 times
of total human cells, and plays an important role in human
health and diseases [31]. The microbiota is complex,
diverse, and stable within a big individual for long-term
[32, 33]. But it changes with outer environment [34] and
is a closely linked to CKD [8]. Vaziri et al have shown a
significant difference in the abundance of 175 bacterial
OTUs between uremic rats with 5/6 nephrectomy and
control animals, with a significant decrease in the
Lactobacillaceae and Prevotellaceae families in rats with
5/6 nephrectomy [7], similar to the findings by Mishima
et al showing that abundance of Lactobacillaceae and
Prevotellaceae families was decreased in adenine induced
CKD mice [35]. We also found that the Lactobacillus
genus from Lactobacillaceae family was markedly
reduced in CCI control group of CRF according to both
pyrosequencing and real-time PCR analyses. Like studies
by Hide et al [36], the total number of bacteria in our
study exhibited no any significant difference between
each group, while the number of C. perfringens was
increased in CCI control group with CRF. We also found
that genera of Ruminococcus, Clostridium and unclassified
genus from Ruminococcaceae family were also increased

in CCI control group. A recent study demonstrated
significant improvements in renal function as well as
colonic inflammation and epithelial barrier structure in
CKD rats fed with a high fiber diet [37], suggesting an
important impact of the dietary restriction on the structure
and function of microbiome. Thus, it remains to be defined
how ECI treatments with dietary restriction would alter the
gut microbiota.
Among strategies of improving renal function in
CKD by reducing uremic toxins, new therapies targeting
the colonic microenvironment aim to modulate gut
microbiota or clear uremic toxin solutes derived from the
microbiota metabolisms. We first detected the rat fecal
microbiota and found that Clostridium was remarkably
decreased after ECI treatments. Lactobacillus was
improved in ECI group, while C. perfringens was reduced.
But we found that Enteroroccus was markedly reduced
while Bifidbacteria was improved with ECI treatments
according to real-time quantitative PCR, though barely
detectable by pyrosequencing. Hide et al reported
that Enteroroccus was augmented but Bifidbacteria
was decreased in CKD status, suggesting that the gut
microbiota tends to resume the original balance in the
healthy status upon ECI treatments.

Bacterial species are roughly categorized as the
saccharolytic or proteolytic. Wong et al used Silico tests
to find that bacterial families possessing urease, uricase,
and indole-and p-cresol-forming enzymes were expanded
while butyrate producing bacteria were reduced in patients
with ESRD [38]. Similar to the findings by Wong et al,
the harmful genus of Clostridium from Clostridiaceae

family possessing urease and indole-forming enzymes
was increased in CCI control with CRF and positively
correlated with urea and IS, but this increase was offset
by ECI treatments. In particular, the increase in C.
perfringens from Clostridium genus was also abrogated
by ECI treatments. Some studies also showed that
Clostridium difficile from Clostridium genus is associated

Serum preparation and quantitative detection of
uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS)

with increased mortality for CKD and ESRD [39, 40]. This
finding proved that Clostridium is a bad bacterial genus,
which increases the production of urea and IS in CKD, and
that ECI treatments may reverse the course. On the other
hand, the bacterial genera of Lactobacillus and Prevotella
from the Lactobacillaceae and Prevotellaceae families
possessing butyrate-producing enzymes were reduced in
CCI control with CRF and negatively correlated with urea,
while ECI treatments significantly rescued the genus of
Lactobacillus, but not Prevotella. These two genera have
been reported to confer beneficial effects of improving
butyrate that can expand regulatory T cells in the large
intestine [41]. Therefore, these ECI-induced beneficial
genera may help attenuate inflammation by suppressing
pro-inflammatory cells in CKD. It is noteworthy that the
association of uremic toxins with gut microbiota changes
induced by ECI is not in a cause-effect manner. Future
studies are needed for establishing such a manner.

The chemicals, including the standard IS potassium
salt (purity 99.8%), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA), and the internal standard of
hydrochlorothiazide (purity 99.5%) was obtained from
Institute for Drug Control (Guangzhou, China), while
methanol (LC-MS grade) and ammonium acetate were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Firstly, 100 μL of fixed serum was pipetted into 1.5
mL polypropylene tube, and 500 μL hydrochlorothiazide
in methanol solution (25 μg/mL) was added to precipitate
the protein. The tubes were mixed by vortex for 1 minute.
After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes, 100
μL clear supernatant was extracted and mixed with 100
μL ddH2O to filter into a new polypropylene tube, and
transferred to an auto-sampler. The curve standards were
prepared at 0.25, 0.5, l, 5, 10, 50 μg/mL in methanol for
IS, dried out using vacuum spinner (Thermo, Waltham,
MA, USA), re-dissolved with normal rats’ serum, and
finally analyzed as described in the serum method. Low,
medium and high concentrations of quality-control (QC)
samples were also prepared. The IS-quantitative method
was described in our previous studies [42].

Materials and Methods
Animals, interventions and samples
Male Sprague-Dawley rats with a body weight
of approximately 200g were used and purchased from
Experimental Animal Center of Guangdong Province
(Guangzhou, China). Animals were housed in a specific
pathogen free (SPF) environment with 12 hours of
light-dark cycles and were fed with standard laboratory
food and water ad libitum. The animals were randomly
assigned to the sham-operation control groups (CTL)
and experimental groups. All experimental CRF groups
underwent 5/6 of nephrectomy via surgical removal of the
upper and lower thirds of the left kidney, and resection
of whole right kidney seven days later. The procedures
were conducted under common anesthesia using strictly
aseptic techniques. The animals with CRF again were
randomly assigned to the emodin colonic irrigation (ECI)
and control colonic irrigation (CCI) groups 8 weeks after
5/6 of nephrectomy. Animals of ECI groups were given
emodin via colonic irrigation using a lavage needle (8 cm)
through the anus, at 5 mL(1 mg/day) for four weeks, and
the water containing 0.4% CMC-Na was used to dissolve
emodin for ECI treatments or to serve as CCI control
group without emodin. Four weeks after the irrigation,
fresh fecal, urine and serum samples were collected
from the animal trails. All the samples were stored at
-80oC until analyses. All animal experiments in this study
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Second Clinical College, Guangzhou
University of Chinese Medicine(Guangzhou, China), and
were performed in accordance with the Declaration of
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 80-23, 1996).

Fecal bacterial DNA extraction
Each fecal bacterial DNA was extracted using
the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit (QIAGEN, GmbH,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The
completed DNA samples were stored at -80oC before use.

Analysis of dominant fecal microbiota by RealTime quantitative PCR
Quantification of gene expression was performed via
the LightCycler System I (BioRad, Richmond, CA, USA)
using iQTm SYBR Green SuperMix (BioRad). Reaction
mixtures (20 μL) contained 10 μL of 2 × SYBR-Mix, 1
μL of template DNA, 1 μL of each primer, and 7 μL of
ddH2O. The primers for 5’ nuclease assays were based
on sequences of the 16S rRNA region of special species,
as listed in Supplementary Table S3. Real-time PCR
quantification of species-specific DNA was performed
using a standard curve generated from the dilution series
(from 1×102 to 1×109 copies/μL) of a standard strain
(Supplementary Table S4). Standard and quantified
samples were run in triplicates. The temperature program
for the qPCR included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C
for 3min followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C
for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72
°C for 60 s. The melting curve was obtained by gradual
heating with a 0.5 °C/s increment from 50 °C to 95 °C

Statistical analyses

The V3-V5 regions in the 16S rRNA gene of
Escherichia coli were amplified by PCR from extracted
DNA using sample-unique DNA bar-coded primers
(forward: 5’-CCGTCAA- TTCMTTTGAGTTT-3’,
reverse: 5’-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’) [43].
The PCR reaction program was as follows: 3 min initial
denaturation at 94°C, 20 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 1min, annealing from 65°C to 55°C (1°C reduction for
every two cycles) for 1 min, elongation at 72°C for 1 min,
and the final extension at 72°C for 6 min [44]. Then, the
resulting products were verified via gel electrophoresis.
DNA pyrosequencing was carried out on 454 GS FLX+
platform (Roche, Branford, CT, USA).

Raw data generated from the 454-pyrosequencing
running were processed following the pipelines of
Mothur (version 1.29) [45] and QIIME according to
Kuang’s method [46]. Briefly, the low quality sequences
were trimmed with an average quality score less
than 20 using a 50 bp sliding window, and chimeric
sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME
with de novo method [47]. Quality sequences were
subsequently assigned to samples according to their
unique 10-bp barcode and binned into phylotypes using
average clustering algorithm at the 97% similarity level.
Representative sequences were aligned using NAST [48]
and taxonomic classification of phylotypes was obtained
using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (at
least 80% threshold) [49]. In addition, the phylogenetic
tree of representative sequences of operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) was built using FastTree [50] with
default parameters. Finally OTU table was tabulated by
combining the information of relative abundance in each
sample and taxonomic classification for each OTU.
The α- and β- diversities were performed using
QIIME [51]. The established phylogenetic tree and the
relative abundance table of representative sequences
of OTUs were used for Weighted UniFrac analysis and
UniFrac principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) [52].
We obtained the abundance differences in microbial
communities from three groups, and FDR (false discovery
rate) was adopted to assess the significance of differences
using one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). We identified the urea
and IS as environmental variables using Redundancy
analysis with CANOCO, and the statistical significance
was assessed by MCPP. The Spearman’s correlation
