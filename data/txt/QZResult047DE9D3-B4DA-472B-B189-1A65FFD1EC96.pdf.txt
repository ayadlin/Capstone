Abstract
Tumor angiogenesis is a validated target for therapeutic
intervention, but agents that are more disease selective are
needed. Here, we report the isolation of secalonic acid-D
(SAD), a mycotoxin from a novel source that exhibits potent
antiangiogenic antitumor activity. SAD inhibited multiple
HIF1a/VEGF-arbitrated angiogenesis dynamics as scored in
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and human
MCF-7 breast tumor xenografts. Similarly, SAD suppressed
VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting from rat aortic ring and
blood vessel formation in the Matrigel plug assay in C57/BL6J
mice. Under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, SAD inhibited
cell survival through the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, with
attendant effects on key proangiogenesis factors, including

HIF1a, VEGFR, and MMP-2/MMP-9. These effects were
reversed by cotreatment with the Akt inhibitors perifosine and
GSK69069 or by the addition of neutralizing VEGF antibodies.
The apoptotic properties of SAD were determined to be both
extrinsic and intrinsic in nature, whereas the cell-cycle inhibitory
effects were mediated by altering the level of key G1–S transitionphase proteins. In experimental mouse models of breast cancer,
SAD dosing produced no apparent toxicities (either orally or
intraperitoneal) at levels that yielded antitumor effects. Taken
together, our ﬁndings offered a preclinical validation and mechanistic deﬁnition of the antiangiogenic activity of a novel mycotoxin, with potential application as a cancer-selective therapeutic
agent. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2886–96. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

target VEGF, MMP, HIFa, etc. They may be useful as an
appendage to chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical therapy
and also useful for nonneoplastic diseases associated with
angiogenesis. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibitors act as a
dual-edge sword that target angiogenesis and potentiate the
usefulness of chemotherapeutic drugs (3). Antiangiogenesis
therapy is target-selective and relatively free from drug resistance and side effects, because it targets normal dividing
endothelial cells, which are genetically stable with leaky,
disorganized, and immature tumor vasculature (4). For these
reasons, antiangiogenic drugs are highly selective toward
tumor vascular lining and make it an attractive target for cancer
therapy (5). Numerous growth factors promote tumor angiogenesis, among them is the VEGF family of proteins that
plays a pivotal role in normal and pathologic angiogenesis.
The activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K–mediated HIF1a/
VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) alliance triggers endothelial and cancer cell functions toward protein synthesis, tumor genesis,
angiogenesis, metastasis, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis (6, 7). Consequently, the discovery of novel HIF1a/
VEGF and Akt/mTOR/p70S6k pathway inhibitors provides
great magnetism in anticancer therapeutics.
Nature is an attractive source of novel therapeutic agents, and
plants play an important role in the discovery and development
of several clinically approved anticancer drugs. Taking into
consideration the limitations coupled with the yield and susceptibility of plant-derived novel metabolites, microorganisms

Cancer is a leading cause of death all over the world, and
approximately 6 million new cases are reported every year (1).
Angiogenesis is one of the common hallmark manifestations
of all cancers and is an elementary event in the development
of tumor growth and malignancy (2, 3). Currently, several
antiangiogenesis drugs have been approved by the FDA that

SAD, a Mycotoxin Represses VEGF-Arbitrated Angiogenesis

provide a decisive, willingly renewable, and inﬁnite source
of novel therapeutic entities (8). The microorganisms, such as
endophyte (fungi, yeast, bacteria), are relatively unexplored,
interesting, and promising niches for the production of novel
therapeutic agents. Among these, endophytic fungi are the
concealed members of the microbial world and have received
less attention due to their asymptomatic existence (9). In this
perspective, we have for the ﬁrst time isolated secalonic acid-D
(SAD) from a novel source of endophytic fungus (Penicillium
oxalicum) of Catharanthus roseus. SAD, a mycotoxin, was initially
isolated from several foods intuitive fungi, but to date there is
no report of its isolation from endophytic (P. oxalicum) of C.
roseus (10). SAD has several biological activities, such as mycotoxin, protein kinase A and C inhibitor, cytotoxic, and K562
cell-cycle inhibitor (11). Conversely, there was no testimony on
its antiangiogenesis potential and effect on the Akt/mTOR/
p70S6K signaling cascade. Here, we report for the ﬁrst time
that repression of VEGF induces in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo
angiogenesis and Akt/mTOR/p70S6k signaling cascade by SAD
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human breast
cancer MCF-7 cells.

for the EAT tumor model and aortic ring assays. The primary and
secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cell Signaling Technology, and BD Biosciences (Supplementary Table S1). The Matrigel and in vitro angiogenesis assay kits
were procured from Millipore (India) Pvt. Ltd. All other biochemicals and reagents used in this study were AR grade and purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell-proliferation assay
The HUVEC, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, PC-3, LNCaP, and fR2 cells
at around 70% conﬂuence were treated with SAD at various
concentrations from 1 to 100 mmol/L for 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours.
MTT dye (2.5 mg/mL in PBS) was added 4 hours prior to the
experiment's termination. MTT formazan crystals were dissolved
in 150 mL of DMSO and absorbance was measured at 570 nm with
a reference wavelength of 620 nm (17).
Cellular and nuclear morphology
The HUVEC and MCF-7 cells were treated with SAD at 10 to 50
mmol/L concentrations for 24 hours and were observed under a
microscope for any morphologic changes that occurred during
apoptosis. Simultaneously, the nuclear morphology was analyzed
through Hoechst staining as described earlier (18).

Materials and Methods
Isolation of SAD
SAD was isolated from P. oxalicum, an endophytic fungus of C.
roseus. The pure endophytic fungal isolate (EF-VR2) was isolated
from the roots of C. roseus (family: Apocynaceae; ref. 12). The
isolation of pure genomic DNA of fungal endophyte (EF-VR2)
was done as described earlier with slight modiﬁcations (13). The
PCR ampliﬁcation of ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 regions was performed, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by using MEGA5
software and was subsequently analyzed for evolutionary distances by the neighbor joining method (14). The contiguous
rDNA sequences of the representative isolate were submitted to
the GenBank database using SEQUIN program with accession no.
KC189890. The single spore of the P. oxalicum was obtained,
lyophilized, and maintained at 4 C for long-term preservation
(15). The fermentation was performed, and broth was extracted
according to the NCI protocol. The organic extract was then
subjected to column chromatography to obtain pure SAD. The
compound was characterized by various spectroscopic methods,
viz., 1H and 13C NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry,
optical rotation, and IR, and was found to be in accordance to
the literature (16).
Cell culture, animal, and reagents
HUVEC, breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, prostate
cancer PC-3, pancreatic cancer LNCaP, and human breast epithelial fR2 cells were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich India (ECACC).
The HUVECs were grown in complete EndoGRO-LS media with
VEGF (#SCME001; Millipore), and the remaining cells were
grown in Minimal Essential Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 20 ng/mL VEGF supplement only for MCF-7 cells. All the cells
were cultured at 37 C with 95% humidity and 5% CO2 gas
environment. All animal experiments were approved by the
animal ethics committee of the Indian Institute of Integrative
Medicine, CSIR, Jammu, India (IEAC No. 34/8/14). Animal
euthanasia was performed by carbon dioxide inhalation (10%–
30% vol/min) in the Matrigel plug assay and cervical dislocation

Annexin V–FITC assay
HUVEC and MCF-7 cells were treated with SAD at 10 to 50
mmol/L concentrations for 24 hours. The cells were collected at
400  g and stained with Annexin V–FITC antibody as per
instructions provided with the Apoptosis Detection Kit (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; ref. 17).
Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (cmt)
HUVEC and MCF-7 cells were exposed to 10, 30, and 50 mmol/L
concentrations of SAD for 24 hours. Rhodamine-123 (200
nmol/L) was added 40 minutes before termination and washed
with PBS and attain on ﬂow cytometer (17).
Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analysis
The HUVEC and MCF-7 cells were treated with SAD at 10, 30,
and 50 mmol/L concentrations for 6 to 24 hours in the presence
and absence of VEGF (20 ng/mL) and CoCl2 (100 mmol/L). The
whole cells, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were prepared
as described earlier (17). An equal amount of protein (40–70 mg)
was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred to the polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. The membrane was blocked
with 5% nonfat milk-TBS or 3% BSA-TBS (for phospholyrated
antibodies) and probed with respective primary and secondary
antibodies mentioned in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell-cycle analysis
The breast cancer MCF-7 cells and HUVECs were treated with
SAD at 10, 30, and 50 mmol/L concentrations for 24 hours in the
presence of VEGF (20 ng/mL). The cell cycle was analyzed on ﬂow
cytometer as described earlier (19).
Colony-formation assay
The MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of
SAD (10, 30, and 50 mmol/L) for 24 hours in the presence of VEGF
(20 ng/mL). Colony-formation assay was carried out as described
earlier (20). Colonies of 50 or more cells were counted from three
independent experiments.

Immunoﬂuorescence
MCF-7 cells supplemented with fresh medium with or without
VEGF (20 ng/mL) were cultured on the sterile cover slips placed on
the surface of 6-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well.
Cells were treated with different concentrations of SAD (10–50
mmol/L) for 24 hours, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
incubated with mTOR primary antibody.
RT-PCR analysis
Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were treated with SAD (10–
50 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted by using Trireagent (Sigma) and incubated with RNase free DNase. cDNAs
were synthesized from equal amount of RNA (3 mg) using RevertAid cDNA Synthesis Kit according to manufacturer's instruction.
SYBR Green PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using the StepOne
Real-time PCR System. Two set of primers as listed in Supplementary Table S2 were used to amplify housekeeping genes
GAPDH and b-actin.
Gelatin zymography
The MCF-7 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of
SAD for 24 hours, and the culture medium was electrophoresed
(80 V for 120 minutes) on 8% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.1%
gelatin. The gel was assessed for two gelatin-degrading matrix
metalloproteinase, MMP-2 and MMP-9, as described earlier (21).
Wound-healing migration assay
The wound-healing migration assay was performed as
described previously (22). Brieﬂy, HUVECs were treated with
mitomycin-C to inactivate cell proliferation, wounded by a microtip, washed with PBS, supplemented with fresh medium with or
without VEGF (20 ng/mL) and treated with SAD.
Capillary-like tube formation assay
The tube formation assay was performed according to the
instructions provided by the in vitro Angiogenesis Assay Kit
(Millipore, Cat. No. ECM 625). Brieﬂy, HUVECs were seeded
on the surface of the polymerized EC Matrix and incubated
at 37 C for 12 hours. The cells were treated with different
concentrations of SAD for 24 hours, and capillary-like tube
sprouting was observed under an inverted microscope at 10
magniﬁcation.

parafﬁn, sectioned at a thickness of 5 mm, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Tumor angiogenesis Matrigel plug assay
The Matrigel plug assay was performed as described previously
(23). Brieﬂy, 0.5 mL of Matrigel with VEGF (100 ng), in the presence
and absence of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (0.5  106), was
injected subcutaneously into the ventral area of 4- to 6-week-old
C57/BL6J mice (IIIM, central animal house). Animals were dosed
daily with SAD (10 and 20 mg/kg/body weight; oral/i.p.) from day
2 to day 6. On day 7, animals were sacriﬁced to remove intact
Matrigel plugs with different treatments and photographed that
show the extent of vascularization. Neovascularization of Matrigel
plugs was quantiﬁed by measuring their size and hemoglobin (Hb)
content through the Drabkin reagent.
Ehrlich tumor solid
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells (1  107) were collected
from 8- to 10-day-old Swiss albino mice and were injected
(intramuscularly) in the right thigh on day 0. On day 1, the
animals were randomized and divided into different groups. SAD
was given i.p. at 10 and 20 mpk of body weight from day 1 to 9.
Similarly, the control group received vehicle, whereas treatment
with 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), 22 mpk i.p., was given to a group of
mice serving as positive control. On day 13, animals were sacriﬁced, and average tumor weight was calculated.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SD or representative of one of
three similar experiments unless otherwise indicated. Comparisons were made between control and treated groups or the entire
intragroup using one-way and two-way ANOVA with the postBonferroni test through GraphPad Prism 5.00.288 statistical
analysis software.

Results

Chemotaxis cell migration and invasion assays
Microporous membrane inserts are widely used for cell migration and invasion assays. MCF-7 and HUVECs were incubated on
the surface of the insert and treated with different concentrations
of SAD for 24 hours. The cell migration and invasion percentage
was calculated as per the protocol of the respective kits (Millipore;
cat. nos. ECM509 and ECM554).

Isolation, characterization, and cytotoxic proﬁle of SAD
SAD was isolated from the pure endophytic fungal isolate (EFVR2) of P. oxalicum from C. roseus. The morphology and sequencing of P. oxalicum, endophyte fungi isolate (EF-VR2), was characterized with a neighbor-joining rooted tree (Supplementary
Fig. S1A–S1E). SAD inhibits cell proliferation of HUVEC and
different cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S1F). SAD was found to be nontoxic at the
experimental concentration in normal human breast epithelial
fR2 cells, where the IC50 value was 13 times higher than in MCF-7
cells. The cytotoxic effect of SAD was more pronounced in HUVEC
and MCF-7 cells; therefore, we have explored both these cells for
further studies.

Aortic ring assay
The aortas isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats were cleaned and
cut into rings of 1- to 1.5-mm circumference. The aortic rings were
randomized into Matrigel-coated wells and sealed with a 100 mL
overlay of Matrigel (23). The aortic rings were cultured in EndoGRO LS Media with and without 20 ng/mL of VEGF for 4 days. On
day 5, various concentrations of SAD (10–30 mmol/L) were added
to the wells and further incubated for 96 hours. On day 9, the
microvessel sprouting was ﬁxed and photographed. The aortic
ring tissue was ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in

SAD inhibits VEGF-induced chemotactic wound-healing
migration and microvessel sprouting
Chemotactic motility and microvessel sprouting are necessary
for tumor growth and metastasis (24). SAD signiﬁcantly inhibited
VEGF-induced HUVEC migration in a dose-dependent manner
and decreased the wound-closure percentage from 100% to 10%
at 50 mmol/L concentrations (Fig. 1A and B). To further assess the
effect of SAD on angiogenesis, we examined how SAD regulates
capillary tube formation of endothelial cells. HUVECs showed
robust tubular-like structures when seeded on two-dimensional

Matrigel containing VEGF, which was signiﬁcantly abolished by
SAD in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its potential inhibitory efﬁcacy of VEGF-induced angiogenesis (Fig. 1C and D).
SAD inhibits chemotaxis cell migration and invasion
Boyden chamber assays enable simulation of the barriers
invaded by and conditions encountered by metastatic tumor cells
in vivo. SAD signiﬁcantly inhibits the invasion and migration of
both the MCF-7 and HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner. The
migration inhibition percentage was reduced from 100% to 10%
at 50 mmol/L concentration of SAD, whereas the invasion inhibition percentage was reduced from 100% to 30% in both
experimental cell lines (Fig. 1E and F).
SAD inhibits VEGF-induced microvessel sprouting ex vivo
angiogenesis
The aortic ring assay allows analysis of cellular proliferation,
migration, tube formation, microvessel branching, perivascular
recruitment, which provide a more complete picture of angiogenic processes compared with traditional cell-based assays. VEGF
(20 ng/mL) signiﬁcantly stimulated microvessel sprouting, and
this effect was completely inhibited by SAD in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1G). The histologic analysis of rat aortic ring further

2890 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

revealed that SAD inhibits the microvessel sprouting in the same
manner (Fig. 1H).
SAD inhibits VEGF-induced tumor angiogenesis in the Matrigel
plug assay
Angiogenesis is the key stride in tumor growth and metastasis
(25). To determine the effects of SAD on VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo, mice were dosed orally or i.p. with SAD (10–20
mg/kg/body weight) after Matrigel implantation in the presence
and absence of MCF-7 cells. Matrigel plug of untreated animals
revealed the marked increase in vascularization and size, seen as a
deep red appearance and high Hb content (Fig. 2A). The Matrigel
plugs of animals dosed with SAD (10 and 20 mg/kg/body weight)
show a complete reduction in the degree of vascularization and
size and appear as white and negligible Hb content (Fig. 2B),
indicating that SAD signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis.
We also obtained the same results when animals were treated
with SAD at 10 to 20 mg/kg/body weight i.p. in the presence and
absence of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2C–E).
SAD induced inhibition of tumor growth in experimental mice
SAD was evaluated for its efﬁcacy in the inhibition of
tumor growth in solid tumor models of mice (Fig. 4F). When

administered i.p. at doses of 10 and 20 mpk body weight daily for
90 days, SAD produced a signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition of
44% in an Ehrlich tumor (solid) mouse tumor model (Fig. 2F).
SAD inhibited the tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.
Interestingly, treatment of SAD at all experimental doses was
nontoxic in solid tumor model animals as no mortality (0/7)
occurred during the course of the experiment.
SAD inhibits Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and VEGF-regulated
angiogenesis signaling cascade
Akt/mTOR serves as a central regulator of endothelial and
cancer cell metabolism. SAD inhibited the Akt/mTOR signaling
cascade in both HUVEC and MCF-7 cells, which was evident
through both immmunoblot and immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 3A
and B). SAD drastically inhibited the expression of ubiquitation
factors Skp-1, Skp-2, and UBC-3B; however, the inhibition was
found to be at translational level (Fig. 3D). SAD signiﬁcantly

inhibited mTOR-activated downstream targets such as p70S6K,
4EBP1, and HIF1a (Fig. 3A), which are crucial to the regulation of
protein synthesis and angiogenesis (26). HIF1a induced VEGF
expression, which promotes endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) expression, which plays a critical role in VEGF-induced
angiogenesis and vascular hyperpermeability (27). SAD inhibited
VEGF-1, -2, and eNOS expression in both cell lines that resulted in
repression of VEGF-induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability (Fig. 3A). We further assessed the time-dependent inhibition of the Akt/VEGF signaling cascade, which conﬁrmed that SAD
ﬁrst targets the VEGFR signaling (Fig. 3C). SAD signiﬁcantly
inhibited the HIF1a and VEGF expression at both transcriptional
and translational levels in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A and D). The
protective effect of different Akt inhibitors (perifosine and
GSK69069) and the induction of HUVECs and MCF-7 cell death
(Fig. 3E and F) by neutralizing VEGF antibodies on the SAD
further validated our hypothesis. SAD at 50 mmol/L induced 59%

and 72% of cell death, which was signiﬁcantly reverted by the
pretreatment of the Akt inhibitor GSK69069 (500 nmol/L), up to
27% and 18%, in MCF-7 and HUVEC, respectively (Fig. 3F). We
obtained the same result with other inhibitors such as rapamycin
(mTOR) and sunitinib (VEGF; data not shown). We also obtained
the same protective effect for the key targeted proteins (VEGFR2,
Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K) via VEGF-neutralizing antibody (Fig.
3E). All these experiments prove that SAD induced VEGF-arbitrated angiogenesis via Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. Interestingly, SAD also inhibited the expression of ERK, IGFR, and EGFR (Fig.
3A), which is collectively linked with tumor angiogenesis and the
Akt/mTOR pathway (24).
SAD inhibits CoCl2-induced hypoxia-mediated angiogenic
factors
We further investigated the effect of SAD on the outcome of
proangiogenic environment, such as hypoxia on the Akt/mTOR/
p70S6K and VEGF signaling cascade. We pretreated the cells with
CoCl2, which was widely used for the induction of hypoxiainduced angiogenesis (28, 29). The expression level of angiogenic
factors such as HIFa, HIFb, VEGFR2, p-VEGFR2, and all the key
proteins of Akt/mTOR signaling cascade was signiﬁcantly
enhanced in CoCl2-pretreated samples as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4A). The HIFa and p-VEGFR2 expression, a critical
target of antiangiogenic drugs, was completely diminished by
SAD after 24-hour treatment in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, SAD also inhibited the CoCl2-induced elevated level of the
Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling cascade as well as levels of MMP-9
and MMP-2 (Fig. 4A and B). Therefore, SAD inhibits the VEGFlinked Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling cascade in both normoxic
and hypoxic conditions.
SAD induced G1 arrest and distorted key cell-cycle–regulated
proteins

levels (30). When exposed to SAD, both the cell lines showed
a chalk and cheese-like retort in cell-cycle distribution. SAD
signiﬁcantly induced concentration-independent G1 arrests in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A). The case in HUVEC was different; here
SAD signiﬁcantly increased the sub-G0 DNA fraction (<2n DNA,
apoptotic population; Fig. 5A). SAD altered the expression of cellcycle–regulated key proteins such as cyclin D1, E, A, c-Myc, p-Rb,
p53, p21, and p27 (Fig. 5B). These proteins regulate the G1-S
phase transition, which represses the transcription of genes that
govern cell-cycle progression (31, 32). Simultaneously, SAD also
inhibited the colony formation of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5C).
SAD induced Akt/mTOR-mediated morphologic amendment,
mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant apoptotic
signaling cascade
The Akt/mTOR pathway has a signiﬁcant role in induction of
apoptosis (30). SAD signiﬁcantly induced the apoptosis in
both HUVEC and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A and B). The sensitivity,
rate, and the extent of apoptosis were 33% higher in HUVEC
than in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6C). SAD robustly induced loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential in both cells, and the
lethality of SAD on mito-dysfunction was more pronounced
in HUVEC than in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6D). SAD signiﬁcantly
inhibited the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, cytochrome c, c-IAP-1, survivin,
pro–caspase-9, -3, -8, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6E and F). These
data suggest that SAD induced apoptosis by both extrinsic and
intrinsic pathways as evidenced by a decrease in pro–caspase-8
and -9.

Discussion
It is estimated that more than 90% of cancer deaths occur due to
angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of cancer to vital organs.
Angiogenesis is one of the key processes that mediates metastasis
via HIF1a/VEGF signals and the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade
(33). Several angiogenesis inhibitors are used clinically; however,

novel inhibitors still need to be explored from renewable and
inﬁnite sources, such as endophyte. In that regard, we have, for the
ﬁrst time, isolated SAD from a novel source of endophytic fungus
(P. oxalicum) of C. roseus and explored its anticancer and antiangiogenesis potential. Previous studies have shown the cytotoxic
potential of SAD in human leukemia cells (11). However, its
antiangiogenesis potential and effect on the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K
signaling cascade remained to be unexplored. Angiogenesis and
apoptosis are two universal hallmarks of cancer and play a very
critical role in breast cancer treatment and management; therefore, we have explored the effect of SAD on these two events. The

signaling cascade, cell cycle, and apoptosis. SAD signiﬁcantly
hampered HIF1a/VEGF-mediated in vitro/ex vivo/in vivo angiogenesis, suggesting that SAD exaggerated angiogenesis by targeting manifold aspects of endothelial cells. Endothelial cell migration and tubular formation are necessary for invasion and metastasis (34). Moreover, SAD was found to be pharmacologically
active through both oral and i.p. routes of drug administration, as
evident in the Matrigel plug assay. Interestingly, SAD-treated C57/
BL6J mice did not show any toxic effects such as loss of body
weight and mortality (data not shown) at experimental doses.
Furthermore, the SAD IC50 value in normal cell was 13 times

higher than in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. These results suggested
that SAD inhibited VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, with no toxic
effects.
Importantly, our study is the ﬁrst to explore the effect of SAD on
the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. We found that SAD consistently
condenses signaling from Akt and mTOR and stands in a central
position on the crossroad of various cell signal pathways (Ras,
PI3-K/Akt, VEGF, HIF; ref. 26). Overactivation of mTOR downstream p70S6K and 4E-BP1 is frequently associated with activation of HIF, which regulates tumor genesis, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth through VEGF (27, 35). VEGF, which is a ligand for
VEGFR1 and R2, is the most potent angiogenic factor to date and
plays a major role in tumor and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.

Commencement of the VEGF/VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) axis triggers multiple signaling networks that result in endothelial cell
survival, mitogenesis, migration, differentiation, vascular permeabilization, and mobilization. Binding to VEGF receptor-2
(VEGFR-2) initiates a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade that stimulates the production of factors that variously stimulate vessel
permeability (eNOS), proliferation/survival (bFGF), migration
(MMPs), and ﬁnally differentiation into mature blood vessels.
Various anti-VEGF/VEGF receptor therapies potently inhibit
angiogenesis and tumor growth in preclinical models. Therefore,
the VEGF/VEGFR pathway has been a major focus of basic
research and drug development in the ﬁeld of oncology. Consecutively, SAD also inhibits ERK phophorylation, eNOS inhibition,

SAD, a Mycotoxin Represses VEGF-Arbitrated Angiogenesis

and MMP degradation, which are in addition a fundamental
aspect for regulating angiogenesis (24). Further, we also tried
to explore the implication of the CoCl2-induced angiogenic
microenvironment on the Akt/mTOR and VEGF signaling cascade. HIF1a is a key regulatory protein in hypoxic response, which
is downstream of mTOR signaling and is an important mediator
of VEGF (27). SAD inhibits the elevated level of angiogenic and
Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling cascade under both normoxic and
hypoxic conditions. We have validated the above hypothesis by
means of the protective effect of different Akt inhibitors, such as
perifosine and GSK69069, and the induction of HUVECs and
MCF-7 cell death by neutralizing VEGF antibodies on the SAD. All
these experiments prove that SAD induced VEGF-mediated angiogenesis by regulating the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade.
The Akt/mTOR pathway can induce cell-cycle progression by
modulating the protein stability of cyclin D, A, E, CDK-2/4, p21,
and p27 (31). SAD signiﬁcantly inhibits these cyclins as well as
Skp2, an oncogene, which targets cell-cycle control elements, such
as p21 and p27 (36). In addition, Skp2 inactivation profoundly
restricts cancer development by triggering a massive cellular
senescence and/or apoptosis response that is surprisingly
observed only in oncogenic conditions (36, 37). We further
explored the ﬁnal mode of cell death and SAD-induced apoptosis,
which is a hallmark of cancer (2). The rate and extent of apoptosis
was much higher in HUVEC than in MCF-7 cells. Apoptosis can be
triggered by various stimuli by extrinsic or intrinsic pathways.
Extrinsic pathway involved the signal transduction from death
receptors and caspase-8, whereas the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
involved mitochondrial apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Cyt c, and Bax),
which are activated downstream of mitochondrial proapoptotic
events (17). The early event that was responsible for SAD-induced
apoptosis was found to be the loss of mitochondrial potential
that might be linked to the drastic reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.
Subsequently, SAD treatment also induced caspase-8, which was
part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Therefore, these ﬁndings
suggest that SAD caused induction of apoptosis through both
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in MCF-7 and HUVECs.

However, the most predominant apoptotic pathway induced by
SAD was intrinsic or mitochondrial dependent. In conclusion, our
results are ﬁrst to show that SAD inhibits HIF1a/VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis by regulating the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling
pathway in HUVEC and MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Hence, our discovery of this novel mechanism of SAD not only
gives further insights into the antiangiogenesis and anticancer
potential of SAD but also contributes to the role of endophyte in
novel drug discovery and developments against diseases associated with angiogenesis.
