Abstract
Cks1, a small protein whose expression is strongly associated
with aggressive breast tumors, is a component of cyclincdk complexes, as well as the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase. In these
studies, we explored its roles in estrogen receptor–positive
breast tumor cells. When exposed to the antiestrogen ICI
182780, these cells accumulate in G1 by reducing the expression of Cks1, and increasing the levels of p130/Rb2, a cdk2
inhibitor and SCFSkp2 target. Heregulin B1 or estradiol abrogate antiestrogen effects by increasing Cks1 expression, downregulating p130/Rb2 and inducing S phase entry. Depletion
of Cks1 in these cells by RNA interference concomitantly
decreased Skp2 and up-regulated p130/Rb2 and another
SCFSkp2 target, p27Kip1. Remarkably, however, Cks1-depleted
cells not only exhibit slowed G1 progression, but also accumulate in G2-M due to blocked mitotic entry. Notably, we show
that cdk1 expression, which is crucial for M phase entry, is
drastically diminished by Cks1 depletion, and that restoration
of cdk1 reduces G2-M accumulation in Cks1-depleted cells.
cdk1 reduction in Cks1-depleted cells is a consequence of a
marked decrease in its mRNA and not due to alteration in its
proteolytic turnover. Both heregulin B1 and estradiol could
neither restore cdk1 nor sustain cycling in Cks1-depleted cells,
although classical estrogen receptor function remained unaltered. Cks1 depletion also decreased Skp2 in human mammary epithelial cells without altering cell cycle progression. Thus,
the indispensability of Cks1 to the breast cancer cell cycle,
versus its redundancy in normal cells, suggests that Cks1 abrogation could be an effective interventional strategy in breast
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11393–401]

Introduction
The cdk2 inhibitor and pocket protein, p130/Rb2, is abundant in
G0 and in early G1, and a distinguishing feature of cell cycle arrest
induced by the antiestrogen ICI 182780 ( fulvestrant) in estrogen
receptor–positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells is that they
accumulate in a ‘‘G0-like’’ G1 state characterized by increases in
p130/Rb2 (1). The levels of p130/Rb2, and another cdk2 inhibitor,
p27Kip1, are mainly regulated through degradation by ubiquitindependent proteolysis and involves the SCFSkp2-Cks1 ubiquitin ligase
complex (2–4). Skp2, the specificity component of the SCFSkp2-Cks1

ligase, binds to p27Kip1 in a Cks1-dependent manner (5–7). Recent
studies in MCF-7 cells show that forced expression of Skp2 could
confer acute resistance to antiestrogens like tamoxifen and ICI
182780 (8, 9). We and others have shown that certain growth
factors like heregulin h1 (HRGh1) could also induce ICI 182780–
resistant proliferation in MCF-7 cells (10–12). However, whether
this involves alterations in the regulation of SCFSkp2-Cks1 or the
cdk2 inhibitors is unknown.
Targeted deletion of Skp2 in mice leads to increased levels of
both p130/Rb2 and p27Kip1, consistent with a role for Skp2 in the
turnover of these cdk2 inhibitors in certain cells (4). Inappropriate
expression of Skp2 in G0 cells also promotes S phase entry
concomitant with loss of p27Kip1 (4, 13, 14). Importantly, Cks1 /
mice share certain similarities with Skp2 knockouts, and p130/Rb2
levels in Cks1 / cells were much higher than wild-type controls, consistent with its role in p130/Rb2 degradation (4, 7). Cks1
mRNA and protein also fluctuate in parallel with the levels of Skp2
(9, 15, 16). Thus, alterations in Cks1 expression may also provide a
regulatory mechanism for the degradation of cdk2 inhibitors and
other cell cycle proteins.
Overexpression of Cks1 is also strongly associated with aggressive breast tumors and decreased disease-free and overall survival,
and in general, correlates with decreased p27Kip1 levels (17). Low
levels of p27Kip1 have been shown in a number of studies to be
associated with reduced overall and disease-free survival in
patients with breast cancer (18–20). In contrast, other studies
show that p27Kip1 is overexpressed in a subset of highly proliferative breast carcinomas, and this was associated with strong
expression of cyclin D1 and ER positivity (21, 22). Therefore, it is
unclear whether ‘‘Cks1-Skp2’’ represents a good therapeutic target
for breast cancer because Cks1-independent mechanisms are also
involved in the degradation of p27Kip1 and p130/Rb2, and also
because Cks1 / mice are viable (although smaller than wildtype), and normal cell types from these mice do traverse the cell
cycle despite various abnormalities. Nonetheless, it is possible that
unlike normal cells, Cks1 might play essential roles in specific
growth pathways in cancer cells and therefore be a target that
could be exploited in therapy.
Cks1 has also been shown to play Skp2- and p27Kip1-independent
roles. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cks1 were initially identified as subunits of cdc2 and cdc28
(budding and fission yeast cdk1), respectively, although they do not
directly affect catalytic phosphorylation by cdks (15). Subsequently,
Cks proteins were also shown to have roles in stimulating the
regulation of xenopus cdk1 kinases Wee1 and Myt1, and the
phosphatase cdc25 (23–25). Also, high expression of Cks1 not
related to p27Kip1 levels has been reported in non–small cell lung
carcinomas (26). Thus, it is possible that Cks1 is also essential in
other cell cycle phases, and in certain mammalian cells, apart from
its role in G1-S.

In this report, we show that depletion of Cks1 in MCF-7–derived
cells blocks cell cycle progression induced by both estrogendependent and growth factor–dependent pathways. Cks1 depletion
not only slows progression through G1-S, but also blocked their
entry into M phase. Cks1 silencing led to a rapid loss of Skp2,
concomitant increases in p130/Rb2, a rather progressive accumulation in p27Kip1, and marked reduction in the level of cdk1, which
is essential for M phase entry. To our knowledge, these are the first
studies that link Cks1 to the regulation of cdk1 expression. This
being rather unexpected, given Cks1’s dispensability for normal
cell proliferation, suggests that functional abrogation of Cks1 could
be an effective and potentially safe therapeutic strategy in addition
to adjuvant hormonal therapies in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and growth factors. Recombinant human HRGh1 (residues
176-246 corresponding to the epidermal growth factor–like domain) was
from R&D Systems. ICI 182780 (Faslodex, fulvestrant) was a gift from
AstraZeneca. Improved modified Eagle’s medium was obtained from
Mediatech, Inc.
Cell lines and cell cycle studies. MCF-7 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) or MCF-7/LacZ, an estrogen-responsive MCF-7–derived line
with a stably transfected LacZ which has growth properties similar to
parental MCF-7 were used and maintained in improved modified Eagle’s
medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (27–29). T47D or ZR75-1 are ER+
breast tumor lines, and were used in certain studies, and were maintained in
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human mammary epithelial cells
(HMEC; Cambrex), were maintained in mammary epithelial growth
medium which contained the growth factors human epidermal growth
factor, insulin, and hydrocortisone. For cell cycle studies, cells were exposed
to propidium iodide. Samples were then treated with 5 Ag/mL of RNase
(Calbiochem), and then analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) scan using laser excitation at 488 nm (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle
analysis was done using ModFit (Verity Software House). For quantifying
mitotic cells, samples were stained with an antibody specific for phosphorylation at Ser10 in histone H3, which occurs exclusively during mitosis
in mammalian cells.
RNA interference studies. For Cks1 knockdown, four separate small
interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were screened (Dharmacon, Inc.). Their
sense sequences are as follows: no. 1, CGACG AGGAGUUUGAGUAUUU; no.
3, ACCAGAACCUCACAUCUUGUU; no. 4, UCUGAU GUCUGAAUCUGAAUU;
and no. 5 CAAAUUUACUAUUCGGACAUU. Cells plated in 60 mm dishes
were transfected with either a Cks1-specific siRNA or a control duplex with
no known homology to mammalian genes using DharmaFECT reagent
(Dharmacon) in serum-free medium. After 24 h of siRNA incubation,
cultures were either harvested, or re-fed with the medium and conditions
indicated for each experiment, and then harvested at various time points.
Harvested cells were either subjected to FACS scans to determine the
proportion in each cell cycle phase, or were lysed for immunoblotting
analysis. In certain experiments, total RNA was prepared for Northern blot
analysis of cdk1 expression.
Immunoblotting. Fifty micrograms of cell lysate was run on Criterion
precast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto Transblot
nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Blots were probed with
the following antibodies: Cks1 (Santa Cruz), Skp2 (Zymed), p130/Rb2 (Santa
Cruz), pRb (BD PharMingen), p107 (Santa Cruz), p27Kip1 (BD PharMingen),
p21Cip1 (BD PharMingen), pThr187-p27Kip1 (Santa Cruz), cdk1 (Cell Signaling), cdk2 (Santa Cruz), cyclin B1 (Neomarkers), securin (Neomarkers),
and actin (clone AC40, Sigma). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection
with the Supersignal kit was used for band detection (Pierce).
Quantitative TaqMan PCR analysis of Cks1 expression. Total RNA
was isolated from cells, partially synchronized with a 72-h ICI 182780
treatment, at various time points following their release into HRGh1,
estradiol (E2), or control medium. Cells were lysed using the TRI reagent
(Molecular Research Center) and total RNA made according to the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (23). December 1, 2007

manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was made using the Superscript
III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Aliquots
from the cDNA were subject to qPCR analysis for Cks1 and Cks2 expression
using 300 nmol/L of 5¶ forward primer, 300 nmol/L of 3¶ reverse primer, and
100 nmol/L of double-fluorescently labeled minor groove–binding probe.
For Cks1, the forward and reverse primers were 5¶ ATGTCT GAATCTGAATGGAGG and 5¶ TCATTTCTTTGG TTTCTTGGG, respectively, and the
probe 5¶ CCATGAACC AGAACCTCACA. For Cks2, the forward and reverse
primers were 5¶ GAAGAGGAG TGGAGGAGACTT and 5¶ TTTTGG AAGAGGTCGTCTAAA, respectively, and the probe 5¶ TCATGAGCCAGAACC
ACATATTCTT. The reactions were carried out in an ABI PRISM TaqMan
7900 HT Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions under the following conditions: 40 cycles of
15 s at 95jC and 1 min at 60jC. The comparative CT method was used to
represent the relative expression level of either Cks1 or Cks2 transcripts,
at various time points following release into HRGh1 or E2 containing
medium, with respect to a calibrator sample (0 h time point). The relative
expression level is expressed as a unitless number and calculated as 2 DDT
as previously described (30).
Northern blot analysis of cdk1 expression. Total RNA was isolated
from cells transfected with either CT siRNA or Cks1 siRNA. Cells were
harvested either immediately after completion of the 24-h transfection
procedure (i.e., 0 h), or 24 or 48 h subsequent to that. RNA was electrophoresed on agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto nylon membranes,
and probed with 32P-labeled human cdc2 cDNA (excised from plasmid
provided by Dr. Clare H. McGowan, Department of Molecular Biology, The
Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).
cdk1 protein turnover studies. The decay of constitutive levels of cdk1
was measured after inhibiting new protein synthesis by adding cycloheximide at a concentration of 75 Ag/mL to the cells after the 24-h siRNA
application (i.e., 0 h time point). At increasing time intervals after the
addition of cycloheximide, lysates were prepared for immunoblotting.
Construction of cdk1 expression plasmid and transfection. A
plasmid (pTet 3XHA-cdc2) provided by Dr. Clare H. McGowan, that
contained an HA-tagged human cdk1 was excised as an EcoRI fragment and
subcloned into a plasmid upstream of an IRES sequence followed by a
blasticidin resistance gene previously described by us (31). This plasmid,
designated pIIB-HA cdc2 or the control vector pIIB was transfected into
MCF-7 cells using Fugene (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, cells from
both transfections were retransfected with either CT siRNA or Cks1 siRNA
duplexes. Following 24 h of siRNA incubation, cultures were re-fed with 5%
FBS medium and then harvested after 48 h. Harvested cells were either
subjected to FACS scans to determine the proportion in each cell cycle
phase, or were lysed for immunoblotting analysis.
Classical ER function assays using transient ERE-Luc transfections.
Cells were cultured in FBS-containing medium and transfected with either
Cks1-specific siRNA or a control duplex for 24 h. Following the 24-h siRNA
transfection, cells were estrogen-deprived by quick stripping in two changes
of charcoal-stripped calf serum (CCS) medium, and transfected with an
ERE-Luc construct in the same medium. Cells were then treated with
ethanol vehicle or E2 (10 8 mol/L) for 24 h, harvested, lysed, and luciferase
activities determined.

Results
ICI 182780 decreases Cks1 and Skp2 levels while concomitantly increasing p130/Rb2 in ER+ breast cancer cells. To
understand the roles of Cks1 in human ER+ breast carcinoma cells,
initial experiments were designed to determine the changes in cell
cycle regulatory molecules in response to treatment of MCF-7/
LacZ cells to ICI 182780. In cells growing exponentially in 5% FBS,
the S phase proportion decreased from f32% to reach a minimum
of 11% in response to ICI 182780 by 72 h (Fig. 1A and B). Decreases
in S phase were mainly compensated for by increases in G1 phase.
Previous studies from other laboratories have shown a rapid
decline in cdk2 kinase activity in MCF-7 cells treated with ICI

Cks1 Is Indispensable in the Breast Cancer Cell Cycle

progression and enhances Cks1 and Skp2
in ICI 182780–arrested ER+ MCF-7/LacZ

cells accumulate in G1 when exposed to
ICI 182780 (10 7 mol/L, 72 h). Cells

analyzed by immunoblotting to determine
the expression of the indicated proteins.
B and C, cells were partially synchronized
in G1 by a 72-h treatment with ICI 182780
as above, and were then released into
HRGh1 or E2-containing medium in
the continued presence of ICI 182780
(10 7 mol/L). At the indicated time points,
cells were harvested for FACS analysis
of cell cycle progression (B), and for
immunoblotting (C ). D, expression of
Cks1 mRNA in partially synchronized
cells during HRGh1- or E2-stimulated cell
cycle progression. At the indicated time
points, cells were harvested and total
RNA was made. Cks1 expression was
determined by TaqMan PCR analysis
of reverse-transcribed cDNA. Results
are representative of three separate
experiments.

182780, which precedes the decline in the proportion of actively
cycling cells, and is accompanied by a marked accumulation of the
cdk2 inhibitor p130/Rb2 (1). Because p130/Rb2 levels are regulated
by phosphorylation-dependent proteolysis following its ubiquitylation by the SCFSkp2-Cks1 ubiquitin ligase, we examined the levels
of p130/Rb2, Skp2, and Cks1 following treatment of MCF-7/LacZ
cells with ICI 182780 (4, 32). Levels of p130/Rb2 were enhanced
by antiestrogen treatment in these cells concomitant with marked
decreases in Cks1 and Skp2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, although
p27Kip1 is the canonical SCFSkp2-Cks1 substrate, its increases, unlike
p130/Rb2, were modest at best (Fig. 1A).
HRGB1 induces ICI 182780–resistant S phase entry and
increases Cks1 protein and mRNA. We and others have shown
that HRGh1 can induce ICI 182780–resistant growth in MCF7–derived cells (10–12). Because the cell cycle is the ultimate
recipient of all mitogenic signals, we asked whether HRGh1 could
stimulate cell cycle progression in these cells in the continuous
presence of ICI 182780. Cells were partially synchronized with a
72-h treatment with ICI 182780 resulting in f12% cells in S phase
(80% in G1; Fig. 1B and C). The continued presence of ICI 182780
for another 48 h led to further gradual decreases in S phase cells to

f8% to 9% (Fig. 1B), which was accompanied by further decreases
in Cks1, coupled with p130/Rb2 maintained at high levels (Fig. 1C).
The continuous presence of ICI 182780 also led to further substantial decreases in another pocket protein p107 (Fig. 1C). Cell
cycle progression by both stimuli markedly increased Cks1 protein,
which was accounted for largely by Cks1 mRNA increases (Fig. 1C
and D). Although Cks2 is expressed in these cells, changes in its
mRNA were not significant (data not shown). Both stimuli also
increased Skp2 protein levels moderately but consistently in
separate experiments (24 and 48 h lanes, Fig. 1C; data not shown).
Interestingly, despite their well-established roles in p27Kip1 degradation, increases in Cks1 and Skp2 were accompanied by only
minor decreases in p27Kip1 abundance in these cells during cell
cycle reentry by both stimuli (Fig. 1C).
Cell cycle progression by both stimuli also led to the appearance
of hyperphosphorylated forms of p130/Rb2 and marked decreases
in total p130/Rb2 (Fig. 1C). This effect is consistent with the
fact that hyperphosphorylation of p130/Rb2 by cyclin D/cdk4/6
complexes in mid-G1 phase leads it to its ubiquitination and
proteolysis (4, 32). Unlike p130/Rb2 levels which were downregulated, release into either HRGh1- or E2-containing medium led

to substantial increases in p107 pocket protein (Fig. 1C). S phase
entry by either stimulus was also accompanied by the increased
appearance of the hyperphosphorylated form of the pRb pocket
protein (Fig. 1C). Total pRB levels, unlike p130/Rb2, did not
decrease upon S phase entry (Fig. 1C).
Cks1-depletion led to rapid decline in Skp2, reduction in
cdk1, accumulation of p130/Rb2, p27Kip1, and hypophosphorylated pRb. RNA interference was used to determine the
consequences of Cks1 loss in MCF-7–derived cells. A 24-h siRNA
application of cells with either of four different siRNA duplexes was
sufficient to cause a marked reduction of Cks1 protein (Fig. 2A).
All four duplexes were roughly equivalent in terms of knockdown.
In subsequent experiments, we used siRNAs 1, 4, and 5, and
identical results were obtained from the use of these duplexes.
We also found that Skp2 levels were also almost undetectable after
the 24-h Cks1 siRNA transfection procedure (Fig. 2A). Skp2 has

Figure 2. Cks1 depletion by RNA interference in MCF-7/LacZ breast carcinoma
cells leads to decreases in cdk1. Cks1 depletion also simultaneously decreases
Skp2, while concomitantly increasing p130/Rb2 and p27Kip1 levels. A, four
separate siRNA duplexes were tested to identify ones that showed effective
knockdown of Cks1. siRNA duplexes were applied to cells using DharmaFECT
transfection reagent for 24 h, harvested, and lysed. Lysates were examined for
the levels of indicated proteins by immunoblotting. B, siRNA duplexes were
applied to cells for 24 h, followed by harvest at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after
completion of transfection. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting to
determine the expression of the indicated proteins.

been shown to be autoubiquitinated in the absence of Cks1, which
suggests that its stability is closely dependent on Cks1 levels, which
would explain this result (33, 34). However, p27Kip1 levels were
almost equal in CT siRNA versus Cks1 siRNA-transfected cells at
this point (Fig. 2A). We surmised that because steady-state p27Kip1
reflects the balance of ubiquitination/turnover versus translation
rates, perhaps p27Kip1 translation in these cells was not rapid
enough to exhibit immediate accumulation. Therefore, we assessed
the effects of Cks1 depletion at various times after the 24-h siRNA
transfection protocol. We found that both Cks1 and Skp2 were
undetectable for at least another 48 h after the completion of
siRNA transfection, which was accompanied by a gradual accumulation of p27Kip1 (Fig. 2B).
Unlike p27Kip1 however, p130/Rb2 exhibited marked increases
immediately after the 24-h Cks1 siRNA application (0 h time point,
Fig. 2B). Also, Cks1-depleted cells exhibited hypophosphorylated
forms of pRb, beginning at 24 h after completion of the siRNA
transfection protocol, a likely indirect effect of cdk2 inactivation
due to the increases in the two cdk2 inhibitor levels (Fig. 2B).
Most interesting however, was the finding that cdk1 levels were
markedly diminished in Cks1-depleted cells, although not as
rapidly as Skp2. Cks1 depletion also led to gradual decreases in
securin, and modest cyclin B1 decreases (Fig. 2B).
Cks1-depleted MCF-7–derived cells initially exhibit slowed
G1 progression, and are later blocked in G2-M: E2 or HRGB1
cannot sustain cycling in Cks1-depleted cells. Because these
cells have a doubling time of f36 to 38 h, and because some of the
effects of Cks1 depletion on cell cycle regulatory proteins were
not immediate, we assessed the effects of Cks1 depletion on the
cell cycle at 24 and 48 h harvest time points after the 24 h siRNA
application (Table S1; Fig. 3A). Both CT siRNA and Cks1 siRNA
transfections were initially compared in cells made quiescent with
estrogen-deprived CCS versus cells that are rapidly cycling in
response to E2 or HRGh1 (Table S1; Fig. 3A). The S phase fraction
declines after incubation in CCS, and CT siRNA-transfected cells
have 12.3% after 48 h in CCS. The S phase fraction increases in
medium supplemented with E2 or HRGh1, and are 30% and 24%,
respectively, at 48 h (Table S1; Fig. 3A). On the other hand, Cks1
siRNA-transfected cells incubated in CCS exhibited an even lower S
phase fraction as compared with CT transfectants with marked
accumulation in G1 at the 24-h time point and also a slight accumulation in G2-M (Table S1). At 48 h posttransfection, Cks1depleted cells exhibited even higher accumulation in G2-M, as
compared with the 24-h time point (Table S1; Fig. 3A). Even more
remarkable was the finding that Cks1 siRNA-transfected cells
incubated with E2 or HRGh1 also exhibited marked accumulation
in G2-M as compared with CT (Table S1; Fig. 3A).
In parallel, another set of siRNA-transfected cultures were
exposed to complete serum (5% FBS), containing the normal
estrogen component. Some of these samples received ICI 182780,
plus supplements of E2 or HRGh1. As expected, cells in S phase in
CT siRNA-transfected cultures treated with ICI 182780 gradually
decreased (23% at 24 h and 15% by 48 h), with a marked
accumulation in G1 (Table S1). However, cells in Cks1-depleted
cultures were markedly accumulated in G2-M by 48 h in both CT
and ICI 182780 treatments (Table S1; Fig. 3A). Similarly, when E2 or
HRGh1 was added to override the effects of ICI 182780, Cks1depleted cells exhibited an even higher accumulation in G2-M as
compared with CT siRNA-transfected cells (Table S1; Fig. 3A).
When we quantified cells in mitosis, we found that they were
significantly reduced in Cks1 siRNA-transfected cells suggesting

cycle progression in Cks1-depleted cells. A, control or
Cks1-specific siRNA duplexes were applied to cells for 24 h,

medium with the indicated supplements for 48 h. Cells

that Cks1 depletion predominantly results in defect(s) in transit
into M phase (Fig. 3B). In sum, these results suggested that Cks1
depletion leads to an initial transient accumulation in G1. However,
Cks1-depleted cells that have exited G1-S phase experience a more
severe G2-M blockade, which although apparent at the 24-h harvest
point, is clearer at the 48-h point as more cells transit into G2-M
phase from the preceding phases. This is consistent with the loss of
cdk1 protein in these cells which is delayed with respect to the
increases in p130/Rb2.
Reintroduction of cdk1 in Cks1 depleted cells prevents G2-M
accumulation. To assess whether reduction in cdk1 in Cks1depleted cells played the pivotal role in the G2-M block, we
ectopically expressed cdk1 in MCF-7 cells by transient transfection. Stable cdk1 overexpression is not tolerated by these cells
(data not shown). MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected either
with a vector expressing a HA-tagged cdk1 cDNA or a CT vector.
Cultures from both transfections were then retransfected with
either a Cks1-specific siRNA or control duplexes as in previous
experiments. Both CT transfectants and cdk1 transfectants
exhibited similar decreases in endogenous cdk1 and Skp2, and
also exhibited increased p27Kip1 following Cks1 depletion,
although ectopic cdk1 remained unaltered (Fig. 4A). Following
Cks1 depletion, CT transfectants also exhibited a >3-fold
accumulation of cells in G2-M. On the other hand, the G2-M
accumulation in Cks1-depleted cdk1 transfectants was substantially
reduced, with partial restoration of G1 and S phases (Fig. 4B). This
suggests that despite alterations in other cell cycle proteins,
the cdk1 reduction in Cks1-depleted cells is the proximate cause
of the G2-M blockade. These studies were performed with MCF-7

cells in order to show that the effects of Cks1 depletion are not
unique to MCF-7/LacZ cells.
Cks1 regulates cdk1 expression at the mRNA level. In
unperturbed cycling cells, cdk1 protein remains constant throughout the cell cycle due to a coordinated synthesis and degradation of
both cdk1 protein and mRNA (35–37). After mitosis, the translation
of cdk1 mRNA is shut off with a concurrent increase in cdk1 mRNA
decay. However, the stability of the cdk1 protein made in the
previous interphase was relatively high, resulting in its levels
remaining constant. Activation of cdk1 transcription at the G1-S
transition in each cell cycle results in the accumulation of newly
synthesized protein. To investigate whether cdk1 expression was
dependent on Cks1, we isolated total RNA from CT and Cks1
siRNA-treated cells, immediately after the 24-h siRNA application,
i.e., 0 h, and at the 24 and 48 h time points after the completion of
transfection (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we find that cdk1 mRNA was
drastically diminished concomitant with Cks1 knockdown, and
remained very low at the 24 and 48 h harvest time points as well. To
test whether the steady-state cdk1 protein turnover is altered after
Cks1 depletion, we treated CT siRNA or Cks1 siRNA-treated cells
with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis after 24 h of siRNA
application and harvested cells at various time points. Although the
cycloheximide block approach could affect the degradation
machinery itself, it can be concluded that at least under these
conditions, the turnover of the total cellular cdk1 pool after Cks1
depletion was not significantly different from the turnover rate in
CT siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B). The apparent half-life of cdk1 in
CT versus Cks1-depleted cells was 7.2 and 7.4 h, respectively. Thus,
Cks1 positively regulates cdk1 mRNA levels, and therefore, new

cdk1 protein synthesis is blocked when Cks1 is knocked down. This
gradually results in the depletion of steady-state levels of cdk1
protein without altering cdk1 turnover.
E2 or HRGB1 cannot restore cdk1 levels in Cks1-depleted
cells. To further investigate why Cks1-depleted cells are blocked in
G2-M and are incapable of cycling even when exposed to potent
mitogens like E2 or HRGh1, we examined the levels of cdk1, Skp2,
p27Kip1, p130/Rb2, and securin. We show that, in general, both E2

and HRGh1 are unable to negate the effects of Cks1 depletion on
all of these variables, except that Cks1 depletion–mediated
increases in p130/Rb2 are less prominent in E2, and particularly,
HRGh1-treated cultures (Fig. 6). Because SCFSkp2-Cks1–mediated
ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of p27Kip1 is dependent
on its phosphorylation at Thr187, we also showed that the inability
of E2 or HRGh1 to degrade it was not due to lack of phosphorylation at this site (Fig. 6). We also show that the effects of
Cks1 depletion on cdk1 levels are rather specific because cdk2
levels were not affected significantly (Fig. 6). We also tested
whether the effects of Cks1 depletion on cdk1 levels occur in other
ER+ cells by knocking down Cks1 in T47-D cells. A 24-h Cks1 siRNA
application in these cells led to complete depletion of Cks1 protein
with somewhat delayed kinetics as compared with what was
previously observed in MCF-7–derived cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). However, in these cells, Cks1 depletion led to a marked
reduction in cdk1 levels as well (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also
found similar results in ZR75-1, another ER+ line (data not shown).
We also showed that Cks1 depletion did not alter basal or E2inducible luciferase activities in cells transiently transfected with
an ERE-Luc reporter plasmid, nor did it alter ERa protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Cks1 depletion in HMECs does not alter cell cycle
progression. For Cks1 abrogation to be an effective intervention,
the selectivity of its effects would be an important issue. We
therefore assessed the effects of Cks1 depletion on HMECs. HMECs
are grown in a defined medium containing insulin and epidermal
growth factor, and in these conditions, they express moderate
amounts of Cks1 constitutively (data not shown). However, siRNA
transfections are done in serum and growth factor–free conditions
for 24 h, and in these conditions, Cks1 levels are low but detectable
(0 h time point, Supplementary Fig. S3A). Cks1 siRNA duplexes are
effective in these cells and induce marked decreases in expression.
After the 24 h transfection, cells are re-fed with growth factor
containing defined medium, which causes a rapid increase in
Cks1 expression (24 and 48 h lanes, Supplementary Fig. S3A). Cks1
siRNA duplexes are however very effective in inhibiting Cks1
expression. Cks1 depletion in these cells also led to decreases in
Skp2 levels as in the tumor cells. Interestingly, cdk1 levels are barely
detectable in HMECs, and did not exhibit major alterations following Cks1 depletion (data not shown). Similarly, Cks1 depletion did

depleted MCF-7/LacZ cells. A, control or Cks1-specific
siRNA duplexes were applied to cells for 24 h, followed
by harvest at 0, 24, or 48 h time points. Total RNA was
electrophoresed, blotted onto nylon filters, and probed with
a human cdc2 (cdk1) probe. B, steady-state cdk1 protein
turnover is not altered in Cks1-depleted cells. Control or
Cks1-specific siRNA duplexes were applied to cells for
24 h. Cells were then fed cycloheximide (75 Ag/mL)
containing medium to stop protein synthesis, and
harvested at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after the addition of
cycloheximide (post-CHX ). Lysates were analyzed by
immunoblotting. Densitometric analysis was done to
determine cdk1 levels relative to actin and is graphically
presented as a function of time after the addition of
cycloheximide.

Cks1 Is Indispensable in the Breast Cancer Cell Cycle

not alter p27Kip1 as well, which increases after incubation in serumfree medium, and then returns to lower levels in defined medium.
The cell cycle profiles of HMECs after 48 h of Cks1 depletion were
also not altered (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These results suggest
that Cks1 depletion has cell type–specific effects and that Cks1
depletion in normal cells might not be very deleterious.

Discussion
A large proportion of breast cancers that are initially estrogenresponsive, eventually progress to exhibit resistance to antiestrogens, including pure antiestrogens such as ICI 182780. HRGh1, a
growth factor ligand for the Her3/4 dimerization partners of the
Her2 receptor, has been shown to induce both tamoxifen- and ICI
182780–resistant growth in MCF-7 cells (10–12, 38, 39). We surmised that identifying an essential nexus in cell cycle progression
might provide interventional targets for both estrogen-dependent
as well as growth factor–dependent proliferation of ER+ breast
cancer cells. ‘‘Cks1-Skp2’’ and their downstream pathways seem to
be such a nexus. In this report, we have shown that both E2 and
HRGh1 stimulate S phase progression in ER+ breast carcinoma
cells, accompanied by the up-regulation of both Cks1 and Skp2,
with concomitant decreases in the p130/Rb2 protein (Fig. 1B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S4). However, Cks1 plays important roles not
only in the G1-S phase, but also in the G2-M phase in these cells.
Cks1 and G1-S progression. The p130/Rb2 protein in addition
to being a cdk2 inhibitor, is also a pocket protein and forms
transcriptional repressor complexes with E2F4/5 that inhibit
transcription of S phase genes (40). Cks1 was recently shown to
play a role in p130/Rb2 ubiquitination and degradation (4). This is
consistent with our finding that Cks1 depletion led to signifi-

cant and rapid increases in p130/Rb2. Cks1 depletion also led to
p27Kip1 accumulation, although with somewhat delayed kinetics.
This could reflect either a slower translation rate for p27Kip1 in
these cells or the simultaneous operation of other p27Kip1degradative pathways. The accumulation of both cdk2 inhibitors
p27Kip1 and p130/Rb2, and the appearance of hypophosphorylated
pRb in Cks1-depleted cells, presumably due to cdk2 inactivation,
correlates with the initial G1 accumulation. The reason for an
incomplete arrest in G1 is unclear, although it is reasonable to
speculate that even a complete inhibition of cdk2 activity is not
sufficient in breast cancer cells, as is also the case in other cancer
cells such as colorectal carcinoma cells (41).
Cks1-dependent regulation of cdk1 and mitotic entry. The
block in entry into mitosis induced by Cks1 depletion in the
present study is significant. It has been shown that in mammalian
cells, cdk1 activity is essential for successful entry into mitosis (42).
Although reported nearly 13 years ago, a lesser known fact is that
p27Kip1 is also an inhibitor of cdk1, apart from its well-appreciated
inhibitory effects on cdk2 (43). Furthermore, it was also reported
recently that in Skp2 / mouse embryo fibroblasts, there is
increased association of p27Kip1 with both cdk1 and cdk2, resulting
in decreased kinase activities of cyclin A-cdk2 and cyclin A/B cdk1
complexes (44). However, our novel finding that Cks1 abrogation
almost completely depletes cdk1 protein itself, and that ectopic
cdk1 can reverse the G2-M blockade, suggests that Cks1 regulation
of cdk1 expression is an indispensable function in G2-M in breast
cancer cells.
Cks1 could regulate cdk1 at the level of transcription, or during
mRNA turnover, or both. An E2F-binding repressor element at
the 20 position in the cdk1 promoter binds p130/Rb2-E2F4
complexes and represses transcription. This complex comes off at
the beginning of the S phase (45). Because p130/Rb2 levels increase
in Cks1-depleted cells, this could contribute to transcriptional
repression. However, ICI 182780 treatment of MCF-7 cells also
causes an increase in cellular abundance of p130/Rb2-E2F4
complexes (1), but does not decrease cdk1 (this study). This
suggests that nearly complete loss of Cks1, as in the siRNA-treated
cells, could trigger other mechanisms that are obligatory for cdk1
promoter occupancy and transcriptional repression by these
complexes (e.g., nuclear entry of E2F4, complexation with DP-1,
etc.). These mechanisms, perhaps coupled with increased cdk1
mRNA turnover, could drastically diminish cdk1 mRNA, and eventually protein, in Cks1-depleted cells.
Tsai et al. showed that Cks1 depletion in H358 lung cancer cells
resulted in a decrease in cdk1 activity and a modest accumulation
in G2-M (46). Unlike the present findings, however, they did not find
a decrease in cdk1 expression (46). During the transition through
cell cycle phases, cdk activity is also regulated by reversible
phosphorylation at conserved sites such as Thr160/161. Cks proteins
are predicted to prevent access to this conserved threonine in
cdk1/2 to both the activating kinase and inactivating phosphatase
(47, 48). It is therefore possible that Cks1 could prevent the
phosphorylation of Thr161 on cdk1 in certain cell types and block
entry into M phase. It is also possible that decreases in cyclin B1
following Cks1 depletion could also contribute to the decreases in
cdk1 activity reported by Tsai et al. and subsequent accumulation
of cells in G2-M (46).
Cks1 regulation of cyclin B1 and securin. In our system, Cks1
depletion led to moderate, although significant decreases in cyclin
B1. In contrast, xenopus Cks immunodepletion from egg extracts
increases cyclin B1 levels, as a result of decreased activation of

the APC ubiquitin ligase, and prevents exit from mitosis (25, 49).
Cks1 depletion in MCF-7–derived cells also led to decreases in
the steady-state levels of another APC substrate, securin (Figs. 2B
and 5). These findings are in contrast to findings in budding yeast
in which Cks1 inactivation led to a stabilization of securin (49).
Whether premature activation of the APC or subsequent proteasome functions occur following Cks1 depletion in our system, and
are secondary to cdk1 decreases, will be tested in the future.
Concluding remarks. Both orthologues, Cks1 and Cks2, which
are 81% identical, were expressed in the cells used in our study. Our
studies, following specific depletion of Cks1, therefore suggest that
Cks2 cannot substitute for certain Cks1 roles in G2-M in these cells,
just as Cks2 cannot substitute for Cks1 in its Skp2-dependent
function of p27Kip1 ubiquitination (50). It is also likely that some
effects seen in this study following Cks1 depletion are indirect
effects of Skp2 down-regulation, due to its autoubiquitination in
the absence of Cks1, accounting for the inability of Cks2 in these
cells to override these effects (Fig. 2; refs. 33, 34). In conclusion, our
studies show that Cks1 contributes to multiple essential roles
during cell cycle progression in ER+ breast cancer cells (depicted
schematically Fig. S4). It is remarkable that despite the panoply of
pathways activated by them, neither E2 nor HRGh1 could bypass
the requirement for Cks1 in these cells. This suggests that Cks1
plays certain nonredundant roles in these proliferative pathways in
breast cancer cells and could therefore be a target for therapy in
addition to adjuvant antiestrogens. Although ICI 182780 reduces

Cks1 expression, it does not cause G2-M arrest, possibly because a
near-complete eradication of Cks1 is probably essential for marked
reduction of cdk1. Also p27Kip1 increases in ICI 182780–treated
cells are not substantial enough to inhibit cdk1 activity. However,
p130/Rb2, which exclusively inhibits cdk2, increases markedly in
ICI 182780–treated cells. As a result of time, due to slowed G1
progression, cells steadily accumulate in this phase instead of
arresting in G2-M. Growth factors such as HRGh1 can override
these effects in part by stimulating Cks1 expression and could
stimulate antiestrogen-resistant progression. Because Cks1 is indispensable for cell cycle progression by both ER-dependent and
independent pathways in breast cancer cells, unlike its redundancy in HMECs, abrogation of functional Cks1 might be a safe
and effective therapeutic strategy even in antiestrogen-resistant
ER+ disease.
