BACKGROUND: Procoagulant states, leading to activation of the coagulation protease thrombin, are common in cancer and portend a poor clinical outcome. Although procoagulant states in osteosarcoma patients have been
described, studies exploring osteosarcoma cells’ ability to directly contribute to procoagulant activity have not been
reported. This study explores the hypothesis that osteosarcoma can regulate thrombin generation and proliferate
in response to thrombin, and that attenuating thrombin generation with anticoagulants can slow tumor growth.
METHODS: Pathologic analysis of osteosarcoma with adjacent venous thrombus was performed. In vitro proliferation
assays, cell-based coagulant activity assays, and quantification of coagulation cofactor expression were performed
on human and murine osteosarcoma cell lines with varying aggressiveness. The efficacy of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) attenuation of tumor-dependent thrombin generation and growth in vitro and in vivo was determined.
RESULTS: Venous thrombi adjacent to osteosarcoma were found to harbor tumor surrounded by fibrin expressing
coagulation cofactors, a finding associated with poor clinical outcome. More aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines had
greater surface expression of procoagulant factors and generated more thrombin than less aggressive cell lines and
were found to proliferate in response to thrombin. Treatment with LMWH reduced in vitro osteosarcoma proliferation
and procoagulant activity as well as tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that elements of
the coagulation cascade may play a role in and represent a pharmaceutical target to disrupt osteosarcoma growth.
They also have broader implications, as they suggest that, to be effective, dosing of anticoagulants must take

INTRODUCTION
Cancer initially develops as localized clones of tumor cells; as these cells progress to a rapid growth phase and migrate
from the local microenvironment to establish metastatic tumors, a malignant phenotype develops.1 The malignant phenotype imposes morbidity and mortality as the rapidly growing tumor impedes normal physiologic processes or the tumor
itself inflicts physiologic changes resulting in pathologic conditions. An increased tendency to activate the clotting cascade,
referred to as a procoagulant state, is common in cancer patients and portends a poor clinical outcome.2 The procoagulant
activity, mediated by coagulation proteases such as thrombin, is thought to contribute to the malignant phenotype both
directly, by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, and indirectly through the development of tumor-associated thromboemboli.3 The etiology of the procoagulant state in cancer patients is likely multifactorial,2 although evidence suggests
that transcriptional changes may contribute to hypercoagulability.3 For example, cancers in multiple target organs have

been shown to be intrinsically procoagulant, as evidenced
by correlations between the level of tissue factor (TF)
expression (cell surface catalyst of local coagulation) and
increased tumor growth rates.4-7 In this manner, a cancer
cell potentially uses a coagulation-dependent autocrine
system by activating coagulation through thrombin,
which augments the malignant phenotype.
Hypercoagulability in osteosarcoma patients has
been described previously.8 The present study explores
the hypothesis that osteosarcoma cells acquire the capacity
to directly activate the coagulation cascade, resulting in
increased tumor proliferation and tumor thrombus formation. We tested this hypothesis using histological analysis of primary human osteosarcoma specimens, in vitro
molecular analysis of osteosarcoma cells, and an in vivo
model of murine osteosarcoma. If validated, our hypothesis would suggest that anticoagulant therapy directed at
decreasing thrombin in the tumor microenvironment
might represent a novel and appropriate strategy for
attenuating osteosarcoma tumor growth in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of clinical data was performed in accordance
with the guidelines of the institutional review board
(#40194). Animal handling and care protocols were
approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee.
Clinical Data
Patients were identified who were diagnosed with a primary sarcoma of bone and noted at the time of resection
to have a deep venous thrombosis. Imaging studies, pathology reports, operative reports, and intraoperative photos (when available) were obtained. Data collection
included patient demographics; tumor size, location, and
stage; utilization of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy; method of surgical resection (including tumor
thrombectomy) and any surgical complications; tumor
response to neoadjuvant therapy; presence or absence of
edema in the affected limb at surgery; and patient outcomes, including subsequent metastasis and overall
survival.
Histology
Immunohistochemical stains for human TF (1:50; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), fibrin (1:100,
antihuman fibrin neotope on beta-chain; American Diagnostica, Greenwich, Conn), and thrombomodulin (TM;

Calif) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
HyClone/Thermoscientific, Novato, Calif) and 1.0 mM
sodium pyruvate. Murine osteosarcoma K-lines (K12,
K7M2, and K7M3) initially derived from a primary osteosarcoma in a Balb/C mouse9 were provided by Dr.
Eugenie Kleinerman (Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
Tex) and maintained as outlined above. EA.hy926 human
endothelial-like cells were provided by Dr. Edgell (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS).10-12 MG-63 cells13 and SaOS2 cells14 were
provided by RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). MG-63 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10%
FBS, and SaOS2 cells were maintained in McCoy5A with
15% FBS. MDAMB23115 and MCF716 were provided
by Ann Richmond at Vanderbilt University Cancer Biology (Nashville, Tenn) and maintained in DMEM with
10% heat-inactivated FCS and 2 mmol L-glutamine. All
cells were maintained in 5.0% antimycotic solution (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
Measures of Cell Viability and Proliferation
Viability

For methyl-tetrazolium bromide mitochondrial activity assay (MTT), 143B and TE85 cells were plated in
96-well plates (7.0  103 cells/well), and incubated for 4
hours in 100 lL growth media, after which cells were cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 24 hours.
Cells were then exposed to 0, 10, or 20 nM thrombin (athrombin, specific activity 4134 U/mg; Hematologic
Technologies, Essex Junction, Vt) in serum-free media for
24 hours. Subsequently, 20 lL of MTT reagent (CellTiter
96 AQueous 1 Solution Reagent; Promega, Madison,
Wis) was added for 1 to 4 hours. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader (Biotek,
Winooski, Vt).

Proliferation

5-Bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation
assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU kit; Roche, Indianapolis, Ind). 143B and TE85 cells were grown and
plated as described for the MTT assay. K7M3 cells were
plated at 2.3  103 cells/well and incubated for 4 hours in
100 lL growth media, changed to serum-free conditions,
and incubated for 18 hours. Absorbance was measured at
450 nm.
Measures of Coagulation Activation
Factor Xa generation, activated protein C (APC) generation, and tumor clot time were performed as 2-stage assays
modified from previously described methods.17 Cells (2.5
 104/well) were incubated for 12 hours at 37 C in a 96well tissue-culture plate (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ) in DMEM/10% FCS. Culture medium was aspirated, and cells were washed and incubated in serum/phenol red-free medium for 30 minutes.
Factor Xa generation assay

Aliquots of Factor VIIa (Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ) and Factor X (Diagnostica Stago) were added
to the wells and incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes in
Hepes buffer with 5 mM CaCl2 (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Conditioned supernatant (50 lL) was removed
and placed into a separate 96-well plate with 50 lL of Tris
buffer (pH8.2) at 37 C for 3 minutes. Fifty microliters of
2 mM S 2765 substrate (Chromogenix Instrumentation
Laboratory, Milan, Italy) was added, and absorbance was
monitored at 405 nm for 10 minutes.
APC generation assay

Three hundred nanomolar protein-C and 4 nM
thrombin (Diagnostica Stago) in Hepes buffer containing
5mM CaCl2 at 37’C was added to cell cultures for 60
minutes. Conditioned supernatant (50 lL) was removed
and incubated at 37 C for 5 minutes in a separate 96-well
plate with 50 lL of Tris buffer containing 2.5 lL hirudin
(American Diagnostica). Fifty microliters of 0.5 mM S
2366 substrate (Chromogenix Instrumentation Laboratory) was added, and absorbance was monitored at 405
nm for 10 minutes.
Tumor clot times

Supernatant from cells exposed to Factor VIIa/X
(50 lL) was added to 50 lL of activated partial thromboplastin time reagent (Diagnostica Stago) and 90 lL of

2496

Factor VIII-deficient plasma (Hematologic Technologies)
in a cuvette, preincubated for 120 seconds, and then initiated with 90 lL of 25mM CaCl2. Times were determined
with an ST-4 coagulometer (Diagnostica Stago).18
Osteosarcoma-Initiated Thrombin Generation
Assay
The cell lines EA.hy926, K12, K7M2, K7M3 MG63,
SaOS2, TE85, 143B MCF7, and MDAMB231 (2.5 
104/well) were incubated on a clear-bottom, black 96well plate in DMEM for 6 hours at 37 C, then switched
into serum/phenol red-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo)
for 12 hours. Medium was removed, and cells were
washed with 100 lL of Ca2þ-free phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at 37 C for 10 minutes. After washing, Factor VIII-deficient plasma (80 lL), Ca2þ-free PBS (12.5
lL), thrombin substrate (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMCHCI;
Bachem, Torrance, Calif; 12.5 lL, final concentration 4.2
mM), and 164mM CaCl2 (10 lL) were added for a total
volume of 115 lL/well. Fluorescence was monitored at
360 nM (excitation) and 460 nM (emission) at 30-second
intervals for 50 minutes at 37 C. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed using algorithms
previously developed,19,20 correcting for inner-filter
effect, hemolysis, lipidema, and residual thrombin-a2–
macroglobulin complex formation. This algorithm converts the relative fluorescent units to concentration of
thrombin produced.
Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using RNeasy
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Single-strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and oligo-dT primers. Realtime reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed on the cDNA using iQ SYBR
Green supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif)
with the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif). Primers
for human TF (sense,50 -CGGGTGCAGGCATTCCAG
AG-30 ; antisense,50 -CTCCGTGGGACAGAGAGGAC30 ) and b-actin (sense,50 -ACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG
AC-30 ; antisense,50 -GTCAGGATCTTCATGAGGTA
GT-30 ) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). The mRNA expression levels were
normalized to the mean expression of b-actin.

Measurement of Cell Surface TF, TM
Expression
Cells grown in culture were resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA with antibodies for human and mouse TF,
TM, or Phycoerythrin (PE)-isotype (American Diagnostica) for 30 minutes at 4 C. Cells were washed twice, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes in a ST-16R
centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass),
and incubated for 30 minutes with goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with AlexaFluor647 (Invitrogen
Life Technologies). Cells were analyzed using FACSC
and Diva Software (BD Biosciences).
In Vivo Assessment of Tumor Growth Treated
With LMWH
Tumor inoculation

Single-cell suspensions (1  105) of murine osteosarcoma (K7M3) cells in 10 lL PBS were injected into
the left tibias of a total of 20 (n ¼ 10 control; n ¼ 10
LMWH-treated) 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me) as previously described.21
Mice were sacrificed after 4 weeks by CO2 inhalation.
Anticoagulant therapy

To assure that dosing of low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH; Enoxaparin-Lovenox; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) in mice was relevant to levels used in humans, 3
doses of LMWH (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg in saline) were
injected subcutaneously twice daily. Control mice were
injected with an equivalent volume of saline to assure the
volumes of LMWH injected did not cause anticoagulation
by hemodilution. Mice were sacrificed 3 hours after the
third injection, and plasma was collected in tubes containing
0.109 M sodium citrate. Platelet-free plasma was processed
by microcentrifugation at 1500  g for 15 minutes and centrifugation of supernatant at 13,000  g for 15 minutes.
Anticoagulation was measured with thrombin-generation
assay described above, substituting 4 lM phospholipid and
5 pM TF in place of cells for assessment of the rate of coagulation initiation by the mouse plasma and substituting Factor VIII-deficient plasma with platelet-free mouse plasma.
Ten micrograms per kilogram LMWH twice daily provided
the same level of inhibition of thrombin (53%) as measured
by peak height (nM thrombin) as in humans treated with a
prophylactic dosage of LMWH (4 lg/mL).
Analysis of tumor growth

Mice were observed daily for signs of tumor growth,
including soft-tissue swelling or limping. Weekly radio-

graphic evaluations were performed using a LX-60 Radiography System (Faxitron X Ray, Lincolnshire, Ill) (8
seconds at 35 kV). Assessment for enlargement of the soft
tissues surrounding the injected tibia was conducted by
analysis of radiographs using Image J (version 1.44u,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md) as previously described.22 Tumor growth was calculated weekly as
the percentage increase in size of the injected tibia compared with the paired contralateral control. In addition,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-9.4T Inova imaging
system; Varian, Palo Alto, Calif)23 and histological examination confirmed tumor size (mice that did not develop
histological evidence of tumor were excluded from the
study). Extent of osteolysis was determined with microcomputed x-ray tomography (lCT40; Scanco Medical
AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) of the trabecular bone volume within the tibial metaphysis via contiguous cross sections of the metaphyseal region (70 kV, 114 lA, 300
milliseconds integration, 500 projections per 180 rotation, with a 12 lm isotropic voxel size).
Statistics
One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple 2sided comparison test and a 2-sided Student t test were
used to analyze in vitro and in vivo animal model experiments. All statistical calculations were determined using
Prism version 4.0 (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, Calif).
Type I error probability (a) was considered to be .05.
Sample Size
In a previous study,22 x-ray analysis of the soft tissue
masses (at 4 weeks) averaged an intraobserver error (n ¼
3) of 6.64% and interobserver error of 15.84% (n ¼
3), with a normal distribution and standard deviation of
23%. Five mice per group was determined to detect a
25% reduction in tumor size, with a statistical power (b)
of .8 and a ¼ .05 (PS Power and Sample Size Calculations
software24). To account for variability of the orthotopic
tumor model and early mortality, we used 10 mice/group.

histologic (B, C) evaluation of a pelvic high-grade osteosarcoma (*) and associated intravascular tumor thrombus (arrow) involving the internal iliac vein is shown. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by right internal hemipelvectomy and resection of the iliac vein thrombus (A; macroscopic). Histopathology of the tumor (B) showed residual viable
osteosarcoma (hematoxylin & eosin [H&E]) staining positive for tissue factor (TF; CD142), thrombomodulin (TM; CD141), and
fibrin. The iliac vein thrombus (C) also demonstrated viable tumor cells within the organized fibrous clot (H&E), as well as TF,
thrombomodulin, and fibrin deposition. These findings suggest that tumor-associated thrombi may harbor osteosarcoma cells

accelerated tumor growth and thrombus formation. Specifically, a preoperative computed tomography scan of a
pelvic osteosarcoma involving the outer table of the ilium
revealed a thrombus in the common iliac vein (Fig. 1A).
Radiographic and intraoperative exploration disclosed no
direct anatomical association between the primary osteosarcoma and the tumor thrombus within the iliac vein.
Histopathologic examination indicated that the primary
tumor was composed of pleomorphic cells producing
osteoid, diagnostic of high-grade osteosarcoma (Fig. 1B).
In addition, sections from the resected thrombus showed
neoplastic cells morphologically similar to the primary tumor (Fig. 1C), consistent with a macroscopic intravascular tumor thrombus. Immunohistochemical stains for TF
(a procoagulant cofactor) and TM (an anticoagulant
cofactor) were positive for the primary tumor and intravascular tumor thrombus. Further immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that nests of osteosarcoma were often
embedded in a matrix of fibrin (cleaved from fibrinogen
by thrombin). The existence of an occlusive thrombus
harboring tumor adjacent to an osteosarcoma has been
observed in 7 additional patients (Table 1). The findings
of a tumor-laden thrombus were associated with a poor

clinical outcome, as 75% of these patients were deceased

to death, 13  12 months.)
Thrombin Enhances Osteosarcoma Growth
In Vitro
The effect of thrombin in the tumor microenvironment
was examined by its ability to stimulate cell proliferation.
It was determined that thrombin induces proliferation in
human osteosarcoma cells with high (143B) and low metastatic potential (TE85) in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner as determined by BrdU incorporation
(Fig. 2A) and mitochondrial enzyme (MTT) assays (Fig.
2B). This demonstrates that thrombin in the tumor
microenvironment may potentiate the malignant
phenotype.

Figure 2. Thrombin enhances human osteosarcoma proliferation in a concentration-dependent fashion. TE-85 and 143B
cell-line proliferation was measured with 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assay (A) and mitochondrial activity assay (MTT) (B) with thrombin concentrations of 0 nM,
10 nM, and 20 nM for 24 hours. One-way, 2-sided analysis of
variance test with Bonferroni comparison test showed significant difference between 20 nM thrombin and control (0 nM
thrombin; *P < .05, n ¼ 6)

(143B) were compared with parental TE85 cells in vitro
(Fig. 3). The 143B cell line has been characterized as more
aggressive, being highly tumorigenic and possessing a
high metastatic potential when injected into the proximal
tibia of athymic mice, than TE85 cells that are reported to
be neither tumorigenic nor metastatic.25 A modified
thrombin generation assay was used to monitor cell-based
contributions to Factor Xa-dependent cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin. The contribution of the intrinsic
coagulation pathway was eliminated by conducting the
cellular incubations with plasma deficient in Factor VIIIa.
As shown in Figure 3A, the more malignant 143B cells
mediate a greater degree of thrombin generation than the
less aggressive cell line, TE85. By adding an anti-TF antibody to the thrombin generation assay, thrombin generation is dramatically inhibited, indicating the role of TF
for activation of the coagulation cascade by osteosarcoma
cells (Fig. 3A). This was consistent with the interpretation
that increased aggressive properties of osteosarcoma cells,
in terms of malignant potential, are associated with a
greater ability to support the extrinsic coagulation
cascade.
Therefore it was postulated that the enhanced ability
of 143B cell line to generate thrombin was because of
increased cell surface expression or bioavailability of TF.

2500

Figure 3. The extent of tissue factor (TF) expression and
thrombin generation correlates with the malignant potential
of osteosarcoma cell lines. (A) The more aggressive osteosarcoma cell line (143B) generates more thrombin (P < .05, n ¼
6) than less clinically aggressive TE85 osteosarcoma cells.
Addition of anti-TF antibody significantly inhibits thrombin
generation of both cell lines (P < .05 peak height isotype
control compared with anti-TF antibody, n ¼ 6), indicating
that osteosarcoma-initiated thrombin generation is TF-dependent. 143B cells express roughly 2-fold greater amounts
of TF than TE85 cells as measured by fluorescent-activated
cell sorting analysis (B, *P < .05) and real time polymerase
chain reaction (C, *P < .05). A 2-sided Student t test was performed. MFI, mean fluorescent intensity.

Consistent with this hypothesis, flow cytometry revealed a
>2-fold increase in cell-surface expression of TF in 143B
cells compared with TE85 cells (Fig. 3B). Assessment of
the area under the curve normalized to cell number (ie,
fluorescent-activated cell sorting mean fluorescent intensity) allows for comparison. In addition, significantly
more mRNA encoding TF is detected in 143B cells compared with the TE85 cells (Fig. 3C). This suggests that
differential expression of TF in these cell lines is because
of changes in TF gene transcription. This further supports
the hypothesis that osteosarcoma may use thrombin in an
autocrine fashion.

well-characterized cell lines. The cellular thrombin generation assay provides a sensitive method to detect changes
in the rate of cell-mediated thrombin generation, as seen
by a comparison of unstimulated human endothelial-like
cells (EA.hy926) with those stimulated with tumor necrosis factor a (Fig. 4A). Figure 4B reveals that in addition to
the human osteosarcoma cell lines TE85 and 143B, the
capacity of cellular-mediated thrombin generation correlates with malignant potential in the murine osteosarcoma
K-line. To confirm that the correlation of malignant
potential and thrombin generation in human osteosarcoma is not unique to the 143B cell line, we compared
MG63 to SaOS2, TE85, and 143B human osteosarcoma
cell lines (Fig. 4C). The SaOS2, TE85, and 143B cell
lines, exhibiting more malignant potential than MG63,
all showed an increase in thrombin generation compared

with MG63. To extend the correlation between malignant potential and thrombin generation in tumor cells
other than osteosarcoma, the highly invasive human
breast cancer cell line MDAMB231 was compared with
the less invasive MCF7 cell line26,27 and also found to
have a greater capacity to initiate thrombin generation.
These results suggest that there is an association between
thrombin generation and malignant potential in tumorigenic cells.
As local thrombin generation depends on cellular
production of procoagulant and anticoagulant cofactors,
human and murine osteosarcoma cells were assayed for
both expression and function of TF (procoagulant) and
TM (anticoagulant). Table 2 compares the surface expression of TF and TM and coagulation properties of human
and murine osteosarcoma cell lines. Findings from the murine osteosarcoma K-cell lines are consistent with the hypothesis that increased TF expression and decreased TM is
associated with increased malignant potential. The human
osteosarcoma cells, however, revealed increased expression
of both TF and TM. Because these independent molecular
parameters fail to fully characterize the functional consequences of coexpression of procoagulant and anticoagulant
activities at the tumor cell surface, thrombin generation
and tumor clot time were measured as a functional evaluation of the cells’ endogenous coagulation potential. The
data reveal that the capacity to activate prothrombin and
generate a fibrin clot is associated with increased metastatic
potential in both human and murine osteosarcoma cell
lines, regardless of the relative expression and functional activity of the anticoagulant cofactor TM.
Anticoagulation With LWMH Attenuates
Osteosarcoma Growth In Vitro and In Vivo
Because thrombin supports osteosarcoma growth in vitro,
and more aggressive osteosarcomas have greater intrinsic
thrombin generation potential, it was postulated that inhibition of thrombin activity would suppress osteosarcoma growth in vitro and in vivo. LMWH (2.5-10 mg/
mL, introduced at the initiation of the assay) that brackets
the prophylactic plasma levels for LMWH in humans (4
lg/mL) significantly attenuated the capacity of the K7M3
osteosarcoma cells to initiate thrombin generation in a
concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). In addition,
LMWH (10-minute incubation with thrombin followed
by 3-hour incubation with osteosarcoma cells) also significantly inhibited thrombin-induced proliferation of murine (Fig. 5A and Table 3) and human (Table 3)
osteosarcoma cells.

DISCUSSION
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant
bone tumor in children and adolescents.28 Despite significant improvements in clinical outcome because of chemotherapy and surgery, patients with metastatic or locally
recurrent disease continue to have a poor prognosis. Our
findings suggest that osteosarcoma may activate coagulation via cell surface expression of procoagulant factors.
The presence of thrombin in the tumor microenvironment may directly stimulate cell proliferation. Consequently, we postulated, and our in vivo data confirm, that
blocking local thrombin generation or its effector mechanisms can attenuate disease progression.
Multiple studies of nonsarcomatous tumor growth
in animal models demonstrate that thrombin is an essential component of a malignant phenotype. Thrombin is
thought to augment a malignant phenotype through
direct cellular mechanisms and indirect modulation of the
tumor microenvironment through formation of a thrombus (Fig. 7). For example, mice partially deficient in prothrombin have significantly diminished in vivo metastasis
of Lewis lung carcinoma.29 Many studies have demonstrated, through PAR-1 and other thrombin effector
mechanisms, that thrombin directly promotes tumor cell
proliferation, adhesion to platelets, production of endothelial cells, matrix proteins, and vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGF-A) to support angiogenesis.3
Fibrin appears to be important in this process, as fibrinogen-deficient mice also have diminished in vivo metastasis.30 Fibrin is thought to enhance tumor adhesion to
platelets and endothelial cells and/or to provide a matrix
to support tumor growth. Although the presence of a
macroscopic occlusive tumor-thrombus in our case examples (Fig. 1 and Table 1) is evidence of potential tumormediated hypercoagulability, these patients represent the
extreme presentation of tumor-laden thrombi and that tumor-mediated hypercoagulability would more commonly
lead to a nonocclusive thrombus. Regardless of the mechanism, these results highlight that thrombin may enhance
the malignant phenotype through direct and indirect
mechanisms; therefore, we postulate that a tumor-laden
thrombus represents a means of cancer progression via
microemboli.
This study provides the first evidence that osteosarcomas are capable of supporting thrombin generation

2504

Figure 7. Potential mechanisms of enhanced tumor growth as
a result of tumor-mediated hypercoagulability are shown.
Thrombin, activated through tissue factor (TF) and inhibited
through thrombomodulin (TM; A), may contribute to malignant transformation through direct cellular and indirect
extracellular mechanisms. Thrombin may directly activate
thrombin receptors on the cell surface, leading to cellular
proliferation (B), production and release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; C),3 and enhanced adhesion to matrices, platelets (PLT), or cells by up-regulation of integrins
(D).3 Indirectly, thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form a fibrin
clot, which can represent an ideal matrix for tumor growth
and enhance tumor adhesion to cells and platelets (E). Low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may attenuate these
events through multiple mechanisms, including 1) by directly
inhibiting thrombin or other coagulation proteins by catalyzing antithrombin,3 2) by indirectly inhibiting thrombin formation by stimulating the release of tissue factor pathway
inhibitor, an effective inhibitor of TF-mediated coagulation,3
and 3) by inhibiting VEGF-A.3

resulting in direct activation of cellular proliferation and
thrombus formation in the microenvironment. We
hypothesize that a therapeutic approach directed at inhibiting thrombin would attenuate the malignant phenotype. LMWH, a therapeutic anticoagulant noted for its
safety and efficacy in humans, inhibits Factor Xa and
thrombin by catalyzing their interactions with antithrombin, as well as inducing systemic release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the endothelium.31 LMWH
may also affect tumor growth by enhancing or sequestering growth factors. For example, at low doses, LMWH
has been found to enhance cellular interactions of
VEGF-A, but at high doses promotes inhibition31 (Fig.
7). The efficacy of LMWH as an antitumor agent has
been variable. It has been shown to attenuate in vivo

growth in several cancers in early,32,33 but not advanced
disease.21 We show that LMWH significantly reduced
tumor cell proliferation and thrombin generation in
vitro and in vivo. Although we were able to attenuate osteosarcoma growth with LMWH, the treated mice still
developed tumor. Our in vitro data indicate that thrombin’s capacity to induce proliferation is dose-dependent,
as is LMWH’s capacity to inhibit thrombin and osteosarcoma proliferation. Our plasma-based thrombin generation reveals that, although anticoagulated, LMWHtreated mice still generate a considerable amount of
thrombin. These results may explain the variability of
the effectiveness of LMWH in preserving bone mineral
density. Thus, an investigation into altering the dosing
strategy to inhibit a greater amount of thrombin is
needed to determine whether tumor growth can be further attenuated. Also, additional studies are needed to
evaluate the ability of LMWH to suppress tumor metastasis in osteosarcoma because of the limitations of our
experimental model (detectable pulmonary metastasis
does not develop until 6 weeks after inoculation, whereas
lameness and signs of morbidity require euthanasia or
amputation 3-4 weeks after inoculation34). Nevertheless,
the results suggest that a valid hypothesis as to the variable results using LMWH in early versus late stage cancers is that late stage cancers have the capacity to
generate a significantly greater amount of thrombin, and
therefore would require significantly more anticoagulation. This hypothesis is supported by our cellular thrombin generation assay results comparing low versus high
aggressive cancers: osteosarcoma and breast. This implies
that the use of anticoagulation as an adjuvant therapy
requires dosing strategies specific to a tumor’s capacity to
generate thrombin.
Our findings suggest that osteosarcoma cells activate
coagulation and use the resultant coagulant activity in an
autocrine mechanism to promote growth. Thrombin generation induced by the tumor cell can contribute to morbidity by causing thrombosis. Considering that LMWH
and other anticoagulants currently used for non-neoplastic indications have been tested for safety and efficacy in
humans, the clinical impact of this work provides a rationale for cost-effective and rapid new adjunctive strategies to
treat osteosarcoma. Future clinical investigations exploring the effectiveness of anticoagulant and antithrombin
receptor therapies as adjuvants for current treatment protocols for osteosarcoma will be required to determine
whether the findings in this report translate into clinical
practice.
