Abstract
Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is an important signaling molecule in the DNA damage response (DDR). ATM loss of
function can produce a synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with tumor-associated mutations in FA/BRCA pathway
components. In this study, we took an siRNA screening strategy
to identify other tumor suppressors that, when inhibited,
similarly sensitized cells to ATM inhibition. In this manner,
we determined that PTEN and ATM were synthetically lethal
when jointly inhibited. PTEN-deﬁcient cells exhibited elevated
levels of reactive oxygen species, increased endogenous DNA
damage, and constitutive ATM activation. ATM inhibition

caused catastrophic DNA damage, mitotic cell cycle arrest, and
apoptosis speciﬁcally in PTEN-deﬁcient cells in comparison
with wild-type cells. Antioxidants abrogated the increase in
DNA damage and ATM activation in PTEN-deﬁcient cells,
suggesting a requirement for oxidative DNA damage in the
mechanism of cell death. Lastly, the ATM inhibitor KU-60019
was speciﬁcally toxic to PTEN mutant cancer cells in tumor
xenografts and reversible by reintroduction of wild-type PTEN.
Together, our results offer a mechanistic rationale for clinical
evaluation of ATM inhibitors in PTEN-deﬁcient tumors. Cancer

Introduction

pathway resulted in the accumulation of lethal DNA damage
and cell death. In the current study, we ask if loss of ATM could
be synthetically lethal with other known human tumor suppressors, thereby indicating other single-agent targets for ATM
inhibitors. We use an siRNA library designed to individually
target known human tumor suppressors to screen against an
isogenic ATM wild-type and deﬁcient cell line system in order to
identify synthetic lethal interactions. We consequently identify
synthetic lethality between PTEN and ATM and demonstrate a
role for ATM in promoting the survival of PTEN-deﬁcient cells
through the signaling of oxidative DNA damage.

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is the primary kinase
that responds to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 1).
Therapeutic inhibition of ATM has been shown to sensitize
cells to ionizing radiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents (2, 3), suggesting that it may have a role in combination therapy for cancer. Increasingly, however, it has been
found that DNA damage response–targeted therapies, for
example PARP inhibitors, may also exhibit single-agent activity
in the context of loss of speciﬁc tumor suppressors, such as
BRCA1 or BRCA2 (4) ATM inhibitors have a potential role as
single agents in the context of loss of components of the FA/
BRCA pathway (5). An siRNA library screen identiﬁed synthetic
lethality between loss of ATM function and loss of various
components of the FA/BRCA pathway that have been reported
in human cancers. Combined loss of ATM and the FA/BRCA

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
All cell lines were sourced from the ATCC. HCT116 cells
lacking wild-type PTEN have been described previously and
were licensed from Georgetown University (6). The PC3-PTEN–
inducible cell lines (7) and ATM-deﬁcient human ﬁbroblasts
and reconstituted cells have previously been described (Supplementary Information; and Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 8).
Cell cycle, apoptosis, and mitotic chromosome analysis
Cells were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, incubated with RNase A and
propidium iodide (PI), and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson) using CellQuest Pro software. For phospho-histone
H3 analysis, cells were incubated with anti–phospho-histone H3
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Apoptotic assays were performed using the luminescence Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay from
Promega. To assess chromosome damage, cells were treated with
colcemid (0.05 mg/mL; KaryoMAX; GibcoBRL) for 4 hours.

Western blotting analysis
Cell pellets were lysed in 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), 200
mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, and 10%
(v/v) glycerol. For phospho-H2AX detection, histones were
extracted overnight at 4 C in 0.2N HCL from protein pellets.
Lysates and histone extracts were electrophoresed on NuPage
precast gels (Invitrogen), and immunoblotted with anti–phospho-H2AX (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PTEN (Santa
Cruz), anti–phospho-ATM ser1981 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti–phospho-CHK2 thr68 (Cell Signaling Technology),
and anti–phospho-AKT ser473 (Cell Signaling Technology).
As loading controls, anti–b-Actin (Sigma), anti–vinculin
(Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-Tubulin (Abcam) were
used. This was followed by incubation with anti–IgG-HRP
(Cell Signaling Technology) and chemiluminescent detection
(ECL-PLUS).
Reactive oxygen species detection
Cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L CM-H2DCF-DA (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes followed by ﬂow cytometry.
Colony formation assays
Cells were seeded at predetermined densities, 24 hours later
treated with KU-55933 (Calbiochem), which was replenished
every 3 to 4 days. Where appropriate, cells were transfected with
gene-speciﬁc targeting siRNAs (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), and 48 hours later counted and seeded
for colony formation assay. After 10 days, cells were washed with
PBS, ﬁxed in methanol, stained with crystal violet, and colonies
counted. The surviving fraction for a given dose/siRNA was
calculated, and dose–response curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5 ( , P  0.05, Student t test).
siRNA screening
A customized siRNA library targeting 178 tumor suppressor
genes or genes whose loss of function was associated with cancer
(Supplementary Table S1) was developed using predesigned
siRNA sequences (Qiagen). The library contained 3 independent
siRNA sequences per gene and was provided in an arrayed format
in 96-well plates. ATM-deﬁcient and ATM-complemented cells
were reverse transfected with the siRNA library (Qiagen) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Life Technologies; Supplementary Information).
Xenograft study
Cells (3  107) were implanted into male Fox Chase Severe
Combined Immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories). Administration of doxycycline was started when
tumors reached 100 mm3 in volume and was performed every
48 hours up to removal of the animal from the experiment. Fortyeight hours after PTEN induction, animals were administered KU60019 (100 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days and measured until
they reached a target 400 mm3 volume. Measurements of tumor
volume and body weight took place every 3 days using calipers
(Supplementary Information).

Results
ATM is a potential drug target for PTEN-deﬁcient cells
In order to identify potential synthetic lethality interactions
with ATM loss, we used a customized siRNA library targeting

2160 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

178 tumor suppressor genes (Supplementary Table S1). The
library was used to screen against ATM-deﬁcient and ATMcomplemented ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 8).
This isogenic cell line was found to be preferable to therapeutic
ATM inhibition for the purpose of initial screening as there was
less likely to be nonspeciﬁc off-target interactions with the
siRNA targets or the ATP-dependent reagents used for viability
read-out. Robust Z-scores were calculated for three independent siRNA per gene, and an average value was then generated.
The screen identiﬁed 9 genes that were synthetically lethal with
loss of PTEN (Table 1). Each of these nine genes demonstrated
an average Robust Z-score  –2 (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
previous data, we found that components of the FA/BRCA
pathway were synthetically lethal with ATM loss. In addition,
CDKN2C and p53 genes involved in the G1–S checkpoint were
synthetically lethal with ATM deﬁciency, indicating that they
may play a compensatory role in maintaining cellular viability
in the absence of ATM-mediated cell cycle check pointing.
Interestingly, the tumor suppressor PTEN was also synthetically
lethal with ATM. Similar to ATM, PTEN had been reported to
have a direct role in the DNA damage response (9–11), and loss
of its function represents a potentially important drug target,
as inactivating mutations are associated with incurable cancers
such as advanced prostate cancer and glioblastoma (12). We
therefore took PTEN forward into secondary validation as a
synthetic lethal candidate.
For validation of PTEN as a hit from the screen, we performed
colony formation assays in the ATM isogenic cells. PTEN
knockdown using two independent siRNAs resulted in reduced
survival of ATM-deﬁcient cells compared with ATM wild-type
corrected cells (fold difference of 48% and 40%; Fig.1B). Next,
we assessed the sensitivity of the HCT116 (6) and PC3 (7)
isogenic cell line models (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) to
loss of ATM function using either gene-speciﬁc siRNA or the
ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (2). Both the PTEN-deﬁcient cell lines
demonstrated increased sensitivity to siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATM (fold difference of 20% and 42%; Fig. 1C) and
increased sensitivity to the KU-55933 (fold change in IC50 of
16 and 8) compared with wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1D).
PTEN-null cells have constitutive activation of AKT. We therefore ensured that KU-55933 did not inhibit AKT, and the
observed sensitivity in PTEN-null cells was independent of AKT
function (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To conﬁrm that the observed ATM inhibitor sensitivity in
PTEN-deﬁcient cells was not model speciﬁc, we tested a panel
of cell lines representing PTEN wild-type and -deﬁcient states
in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer, and normal cells.

In each case, the PTEN-deﬁcient cell line demonstrated increased
sensitivity to the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 compared with the
PTEN wild-type cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1C), suggesting
that this strategy may be of value as a treatment in more than one
cancer type. In addition, advanced prostate cancers and glioblastomas are associated with PTEN loss (12) and are often treated
with radiation; hence, ATM inhibitors may be particularly useful
in these indications where they may have a dual role.
PTEN-deﬁcient cells have elevated levels of ROS, DNA damage,
and activation of ATM
It has previously been reported that PTEN-deﬁcient cells
exhibit abnormal homologous recombination (HR)–mediated
DNA repair through loss of expression of RAD51 (9, 13).
However, this observation has not been consistent across cell
line models (10–11) or in human tumor samples (14). Loss of
RAD51 expression could potentially have accounted for the
synthetic lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM. However,
we did not ﬁnd any association between RAD51 expression or
foci formation and PTEN expression in our isogenic cell line
systems with or without DNA damage, suggesting that HR
functions normally in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3B). Moreover, both PTEN wild-type and -deﬁcient
cells were sensitive to depletion of RAD51 by siRNA, the
sensitivity being more pronounced in the deﬁcient cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C). This further supports an alternative
mechanism to loss of HR in PTEN-deﬁcient cells underlying
the synthetic lethality with ATM inhibition.

PTEN-null mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts have been reported
to exhibit increased oxidative DNA damage (15), we therefore
asked if there were increased levels of oxidative damage in
the PC3 and HCT116 isogenic models. We used a ﬂuorescencebased assay to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
observed a shift in the ﬂuorescence intensity of 101% and
122% associated with PTEN deﬁciency in HCT116 and PC3
isogenic cell line models, respectively (Fig. 2A). In addition,
there was a greater induction of ROS in PTEN-deﬁcient compared with wild-type cells in the presence of the KU-55933
with increases of 212% and 253% in HCT116 and PC3,
respectively. This observation suggests that ATM inhibition
may further enhance oxidative stress in PTEN-null cells. Oxidative DNA lesions have been reported to result in DSBs with
consequent induction of histone-H2AX phosphorylation
(g-H2AX), a marker of DSBs (16). Consistent with this, the
PTEN-deﬁcient cell lines demonstrated increased baseline
levels of g-H2AX (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3D). In
addition, Western blot analysis demonstrated constitutive
phosphorylation of ATM (a marker of activation) and its substrate Chk2, in PTEN-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with
an ATM-mediated response to DSBs.
To further investigate if the observed increase in g-H2AX
and ATM phosphorylation in PTEN-deﬁcient cells was the
result of increased oxidative damage, we pretreated the
PTEN-deﬁcient cell line HCT116 KO22 with the antioxidants
N-acetyl cysteine or beta-carotene. Following treatment with
these agents, we observed reduced g-H2AX expression and

phospho-ATM, indicating that oxidative DNA damage was the
likely cause for the increase in DSBs (Fig. 2C). In summary,
these data suggest that PTEN-deﬁcient cells have high levels of
oxidative stress, resulting in increased DNA damage and subsequent ATM activation.
Next, we asked if the observed increase in oxidative DNA
damage in PTEN-deﬁcient cells was required for ATM inhibitor
sensitivity. We pretreated the HCT116 PTEN-deﬁcient and wildtype isogenic cell lines with N-acetyl cysteine or beta-carotene and
tested the sensitivity to the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (Fig. 2D).
Each of the antioxidants rescued KU-55933 sensitivity in the
PTEN-deﬁcient cell line, indicating that oxidative damage is
required to sensitize PTEN-deﬁcient cells to ATM inhibition.

cycle arrest, chromosome aberrations, and apoptosis
To investigate how DNA damage following ATM inhibition

2162 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

deﬁcient cells, we analyzed the cell cycle proﬁle of the cells
with or without KU-55933 treatment. ATM inhibition resulted
in a greater G2–M arrest in the HCT116 PTEN-deﬁcient cells
compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, analysis
of Histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (a measure of the
mitotic cellular population) demonstrated that these cells
were speciﬁcally arrested in mitosis (Fig. 3B). We then examined whether the accumulation of cells in M phase was associated with DNA damage. Chromosome spreads demonstrated
an increase in aberrations, predominantly in the PTEN-deﬁcient
cells, including radial chromosomes following ATM inhibition
(Fig. 3C). This indicates that in PTEN-deﬁcient cells, ATM
normally functions to prevent catastrophic DNA damage progressing into the M phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore,
treatment with the ATM inhibitor resulted in increased caspase
3/7 activation speciﬁcally in the HCT116 PTEN-deﬁcient cell
line (62%) compared with wild-type counterpart (8%) consistent with apoptotic cell death (Fig. 3D).

McCabe et al.

Calliper measurements of tumor volumes showed that induction of PTEN using doxycycline led to a slowing of tumor
growth from 72 hours onwards (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Next, we investigated the selective toxicity of the ATM-speciﬁc
kinase inhibitor KU-60019 (17) as a single modality in the
PC3-PTEN–inducible model. This inhibitor was chosen, as it is
a potent ATM inhibitor and unlike KU-55933 is active in
animal systems. Despite PTEN-deﬁcient control tumors reaching a 4-fold increase in size before PTEN wild-type controls,
KU-60019–treated PTEN-deﬁcient tumors displayed a statistically signiﬁcant slowing in growth (Fig. 4A). This growth
inhibition was especially evident at the start of the experiment
(days 5–12) just after KU-60019 was administered (days 1–5).
There were no signiﬁcant changes in the mean relative body
weights of each treatment groups (Fig. 4B). Inducible PTEN
expression in vivo was analyzed in resected tumors by immunoﬂuorescence (Supplementary Fig. S4D).

Discussion
PTEN lost in a wide variety of human cancers (12), and its
primary role as a tumor suppressor is through inhibition of the
PI3/AKT pathway (18). However more recently, PTEN has been
reported to maintain genomic integrity and confer resistance to
ionizing radiation and PARP inhibition (9–11, 13), which is a
nuclear function and independent from AKT regulation (19). In
the current study, we have reported a synthetic lethal interaction
between loss of ATM and loss of PTEN. Loss of PTEN results in
increased oxidative damage, which is required for the sensitization to ATM inhibition, as antioxidants can rescue PTEN-deﬁcient
cells from ATM inhibitor–mediated cell death. Oxidative DNA
lesions can result in stalled DNA replication forks and resultant
DSBs (16) and activation of ATM (1). Hence, loss of ATM function
in PTEN-deﬁcient cells may therefore result in a persistence of
oxidative DNA lesions and inactivation of the G2–M checkpoint,
allowing cells with catastrophic DNA damage to enter the M phase
of the cell cycle and undergo cell death. Importantly, ATM has
been reported to function to prevent malignant progression of
premalignant conditions through the signaling of oncogenerelated DNA damage (20). Our data suggest that once a cell has
become malignant through additional genetic abnormalities, e.g.,

loss of PTEN, the cancer cell can then become dependent on ATM
activation to maintain a level of DNA integrity required for
survival. In summary, we have demonstrated that PTEN and ATM
are synthetically lethal, and, furthermore, we have found a
requirement for ATM in the maintenance of DNA integrity and
cellular viability in the presence of increased oxidative damage
secondary to PTEN deﬁciency. The selective sensitivity of PTENdeﬁcient tumors to ATM inhibition in vivo suggests that this may
represent a novel approach to targeted cancer therapy in the clinic.
