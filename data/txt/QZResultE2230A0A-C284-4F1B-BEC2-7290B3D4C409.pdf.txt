ABSTRACT
Notch signaling regulates normal stem cells and is also thought to regulate
cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent data indicate that Notch signaling plays a role in
the development and progression of osteosarcoma, however the regulation of Notch
in chemo-resistant stem-like cells has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study we
generated cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells by treating them with sub-lethal
dose of cisplatin, sufficient to induce DNA damage responses. Cisplatin-resistant
osteosarcoma cells exhibited lower proliferation, enhanced spheroid formation and
more mesenchymal characteristics than cisplatin-sensitive cells, were enriched for
Stro-1+/CD117+ cells and showed increased expression of stem cell-related genes.
A similar effect was observed in vivo, and in addition in vivo tumorigenicity was
enhanced during serial transplantation. Using several publicly available datasets,
we identified that Notch expression was closely associated with osteosarcoma
stem cells and chemotherapy resistance. We confirmed that cisplatin-induced
enrichment of osteosarcoma stem cells was mediated through Notch signaling in
vitro, and immunohistochemistry showed that cleaved Notch1 (NICD1) positive cells
were significantly increased in a relapsed xenograft which had received cisplatin
treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to prevent
Notch signalling inhibited cisplatin-enriched osteosarcoma stem cell activity in vitro,
including Stro-1+/CD117+ double positive cells and spheroid formation capacity. The
Notch inhibitor DAPT also prevented tumor recurrence in resistant xenograft tumors.
Overall, our results show that cisplatin induces the enrichment of osteosarcoma stemlike cells through Notch signaling, and targeted inactivation of Notch may be useful
for the elimination of CSCs and overcoming drug resistance.

effective antitumor agent with a wide spectrum of activity
against solid tumors, and the inclusion of cisplatin in
osteosarcoma treatment has improved outcome for patients
with high grade disease [5]. Mechanistically, cisplatin
exerts its antitumor effects predominantly through yielding
DNA intra-strand cross links between adjacent purines.
This results in inhibition of DNA replication, transcription,
and ultimately leads to cell death [6, 7]. Some patients
present with intrinsic or acquired resistant to cisplatin,

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed
primary malignant bone tumor, with a peak in incidence
occurring in the second decade of life [1, 2]. The
introduction of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapies
have greatly improved the long-term survival for
osteosarcoma patients [3, 4], but chemo-resistance and
recurrence remain common outcomes. Cisplatin is an

leading to recurrence and metastasis. However, the
underlying mechanisms of cisplatin resistance are still
unknown [8].
In recent years, it has been proposed that cancers
contain a sub population of cells called cancer stem cells
(CSCs), which are responsible for the maintenance and
growth of tumors [9]. A variety of techniques have been
used to isolate CSCs from osteosarcoma. Gibbs et al
were the first to show that a small population (0.1 -1%)
of osteosarcoma cells formed spheres in serum-free low
attachment conditions. These spheres had self-renewal
ability as well as increased expression of the embryonic
stem cell markers Oct4 and Nanog [10]. Adhikari et al.
showed that CD117/Stro-1 double positive osteosarcoma
cells possessed the stem cell-like properties of resistance
to chemotherapeutic reagents, increased tumorigenicity,
and increased capacity to metastasize in vivo [11]. Based
on findings that osteosarcoma spheres had increased
TERT expression, we engineered osteosarcoma cell lines
that stably express a human TERT promoter-driven GFP
reporter. These TERT/GFP+ cells showed enhanced stem
cell-like properties both in vitro and in vivo, including
tumor propagating capacity, metastatic activity and
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [12, 13]. However,
the signaling pathways that regulate the osteosarcoma
stem cell phenotype are unknown.
The Notch signaling pathway is evolutionarily
conserved and regulates cell proliferation, survival,
apoptosis and differentiation. Upon binding of a
ligand (jagged 1, jagged 2, delta-like 1 or delta-like 1,
3 or 4) to the cell surface Notch receptors (Notch1-4),
the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) is cleaved and
translocated to the nucleus to induce the expression of
target genes including Hes1, Hes5, Hey1 and HeyL [14].
Dysfunction of the Notch signaling pathway may block
differentiation and lead to malignant transformation
[15–17]. Many alterations in Notch signaling are reported
in osteosarcoma. For example, Tanaka et al revealed that
Notch2, Jagged1, HEY1 and HEY2 were overexpressed
in osteosarcoma biopsy specimens, and Notch pathway
inhibition decreased the growth of osteosarcomas by
regulation of the cell cycle [18]. Engin et al reported a
significant up-regulation of Notch signaling in human
osteosarcoma cell lines, osteosarcomas from p53 mutant
mice and primary human osteosarcoma tumor samples,
while Notch inhibition decreased osteosarcoma cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [19]. A role for
Notch signaling in osteosarcoma was also identified
by Tao et al, who conditionally expressed NICD in
mouse immature osteoblasts and successfully induced
the formation of bone tumors that displayed features of
human osteosarcoma [20]. Despite this, the role of Notch
signaling in osteosarcoma stem cells and chemotherapy
response has not yet been elucidated.
The Notch signaling pathway participates in
maintaining stem cells in the osteoblast lineage and may
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

play a role in maintaining osteosarcoma stem cells [21,
22]. Therefore, this study aims to determine both the role
of Notch signaling in osteosarcoma stem cells, and its
contribution to cisplatin resistance.

RESULTS
Enrichment of chemo-resistant osteosarcoma
cells in vitro
It is hypothesized that a small subset of cells with
stem-like properties are resistant to chemotherapy. To
determine if osteosarcoma stem cells are enriched upon
chemotherapy, an in vitro chemoresistance model was
established to mimic the heterogeneity observed in clinical
settings. We first tested the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin
in osteosarcoma cell lines to select a sub-lethal dose of
cisplatin, which is sufficient to induce DNA damage. The
osteosarcoma cell lines 143B and U2OS were treated with
different concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours, and cell
viability and toxicity were determined by CCK8 assay
(Figure 1A). The effect of cisplatin was confirmed by the
activation of the DNA damage sensor phospho-gH2AX as
well as the transducer phospho-CHK1 (Figure 1B).
The cytotoxic analysis results showed the IC50 for
U2OS and 143B were 8.94μM (95%CI: 8.278 to 9.62)
and 10.48μM (95%CI: 9.19 to 11.88) respectively. 2.5μM
cisplatin did not induce DNA damage response (Figure
1B) whereas 7.5μM cisplatin induced significant cell
apoptosis (Figure 1C). Therefore, 143B and U2OS cells
were treated with 5μmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours, which
is sufficient to induce DNA damage responses but not
significant cell death, for the subsequent experiments.
Cell growth after exposure to 5uM cisplatin for 24 hours
was recorded for 9 days. In this time period cells suffered
a short period of inhibition followed by a recovery from
day 6 onwards (Figure 1C). The surviving cells of the
U2OS and 143B cell lines on day 5 exhibited an IC50
of 15.66μM (95%CI: 14.87 to 16.52) and 16.17μM
(95%CI: 14.75 to 17.87) respectively (Figure 1D), which
is significantly higher than parental cells (P<0.01). Colony
formation assay demonstrated that surviving cells on
day 5 had a significantly lower colony number (Figure
1E), and flow cytometry showed these cells also had a
significantly lower ratio of G2/M phase compared to mock
cells (Supplementary Figure S1). These data indicate that
the cells generated are low-proliferating resistant cells.
Surviving cells at day 5 were thus used for subsequent
experiments (Figure 1F).

characteristics of stem-like cells

osteosarcoma cells are enriched for CSCs. Cell surface
markers have been reported for identifying osteosarcoma

stem cells [11]. As shown in Figure 2A, cisplatin-resistant
osteosarcoma cells showed an increased percentage of
CD117/Stro-1 positive cells (P<0.01). Furthermore,
the stem cell-related genes Oct4, Sox2 and TERT were
upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells (Figure 2B), and
cisplatin resistant cells were able to generate more tumor
spheres than vehicle cells during primary and secondary
sphere assay (Figure 2C). Next, we tested whether
cisplatin treatment could induce epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Immunofluorescence showed that
N-cadherin was highly expressed in cisplatin resistant
cells (Figure 2D), and EMT-TFs including Snail and
Slug were also overexpressed in cisplatin resistant cells
(Supplementary Figure S2).
Finally, we performed a limiting dilution assay to
calculate TIC frequency. As shown in Table 1, 7/8 mice
injected with 5×104 143B resistant cells formed tumors,
whereas only 2 in 8 mice injected with 5×104 vehicle
cells formed tumors. The extreme limiting dilution assay
(ELDA) calculation estimated a 17-fold increase in cancer
stem cell frequency in resistant compared to vehicle cells.
Collectively, these results indicate that cisplatin-resistant
cells display stem cell-like properties in vitro.

in vehicle cells, compared to 18.7±3.9% in resistant
xenografts (Figure 3E). In addition, cell sphere formation
capacity was enhanced upon cisplatin treatment (Figure
3F). Cells from chemoresistant and vehicle xenografts were
dissociated and tested for tumorigenicity. Tumorigenicity
was examined after serial transplantation of corresponding
cells into NOD/SCID mice by subcutaneous injection. 5 x
104 cells from the resistant group were sufficient to form
primary (5/6) and secondary tumors (4/6), whereas no
tumors were formed from the vehicle group (0/6), indicating
enhanced tumor-forming and self-renewal abilities in
chemoresistant residual osteosarcoma cells (Figure 3G).

Notch signaling regulates cisplatin-resistant
CSCs
As the Notch signaling pathway regulates
proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblast lineage,
we sought to investigate whether the increase in CSCs
by cisplatin treatment is regulated by Notch signaling in
osteosarcoma cells. We first tested if the Notch pathway
is activated in osteosarcoma specimens. We performed
IHC staining for Hes1 on 15 human osteosarcoma tissue
samples and their non-tumor counterparts. The percentage
of Hes1+ cells in the osteosarcoma specimens ranged
from 2.3% to 28.5%, whereas there was only 0.55%
Hes1 expression in the non-tumor counterparts, mainly in
multinucleated cells. Among all specimens, more than half
(8/15) of the cases showed Hes1 expression in more than
10% of cells (Figure 4A).
We then tested the Notch transcriptional activity using
a CBF1 reporter. Resistant cells had enhanced luciferase
activity and GFP positive ratio compared with parental cells
(Figure 4B). We examined the expression of Notch target
genes by qPCR. Resistant cells had increased expression of
Notch target genes, including Hes-1, Hes5, Hey1 and HeyL
(Figure 4C). In agreement with the mRNA expression,
protein levels of Hes-1 and Hey1 were also upregulated
in resistant cells (Figure 4D). The level of cleaved Notch1
(NICD1) was also increased by cisplatin treatment,
suggesting that Notch1 activation may play a critical role
on cisplatin-induced enrichment of CSCs. Consistent with
the results from the in vitro study, immunohistochemistry
showed that NICD1 and Hes1 positive cells were 21.9%
and 32.6% in the resistant xenografts (n=6) which had
received cisplatin treatment, compared to 7.7% and 10.2%
in the vehicle group (Figure 4E).
To further validate the relationship between Notch
and osteosarcoma stem cells and chemoresistance, several
publicly available datasets were analyzed [23]. In vitro
results showed that Notch target genes were upregulated
in MNNG/HOS sarcospheres compared with adherent
controls (Figure 4F). Furthermore, an in vivo study using
osteosarcoma cell derived xenografts showed that Notch
target genes were increased in osteosarcoma initiating cells
(Figure 4G). In a study that recruited biopsy/resection pairs,

Osteosarcoma stem cells are enriched by
cisplatin in a xenograft model
We next enriched for osteosarcoma stem cells
by establishing chemoresistant xenograft tumors in
immunocompromised mice, mimicking the clinical
situation under which osteosarcoma patients receive
chemotherapy (Figure 3A). Tumor xenografts derived from
143B cells were subcutaneously inoculated into NOD/
SCID mice. Mice bearing tumors of 10 mm in diameter
(500 mm3 in volume) (n=6) were injected intraperitoneally
with 5 mg/kg cisplatin at intervals of 4 days for 4 weeks.
Vehicle treated cells grew rapidly and reached 1000 mm3
after five weeks, despite being implanted at 5mm diameter
(62.5 mm3). In the cisplatin treated xenograft, the tumor
mass decreased by 36.5% for the first two weeks and
remained static for the next two weeks (Figure 3B). The
remaining tumors were dissociated and tested for cisplatin
sensitivity; these cells had an IC50 of 13.6 (95%CI:
11.9μM to 15.3μM), which is significantly higher than
the parental cells (IC50 17.5μM, 95%CI: 16.6 to 18.4μM)
(Figure 3C). In accordance with the in vitro results, tumors
regrew following the withdrawal of cisplatin for 2 weeks
(significant difference by week 8) (Figure 3B).
To confirm whether the proportion of CSCs in the
residual chemoresistant tumor was increased following
treatment, osteosarcoma cells derived from untreated
(vehicle) and chemoresistant residual (chemoresistant)
tumors were studied. Expression of stem cell-related genes,
including Oct4 and Sox2, were dramatically higher in the
chemoresistant group than the vehicle group (Figure 3D). We
also found that Stro-1/CD117 positive cells were 7.6±2.6%

we also found that Notch target genes were significantly
increased in resection samples compared to biopsy ones
(Figure 4H). Notch1 receptor was also found to be highly
expressed in these datasets (Supplementary Figure S3).

Exposure to cisplatin elicits both pro-survival and proapoptotic signals, depending on the cellular contexts and
the degree of DNA damage [25]. Here, we have selected
a subpopulation of osteosarcoma cells which are resistant
to cisplatin. We confirmed the effect of cisplatin on DNA
damage by observing the phosphorylation of histone
γ-H2AX foci and transducer phospho-CHK1[7]. Surviving
cells suffered a short period of growth inhibition followed
by a recovery. These cells were shown to have decreased
proliferative capacity in addition to cisplatin resistance.
We also established an in vivo model of chemoresistance.
In this model short-term cisplatin treatment shrunk the
tumor mass by 70% but enriched for chemoresistant cells,
and was followed by tumour re-growth. We therefore
successfully established both an in vitro and in vivo
osteosarcoma cisplatin resistance model.
It is well established that CSCs are more resistant
to standard cancer chemotherapies than bulk tumour
cells. We and others have indicated that osteosarcoma
stem cells are both tumour initiating and chemoresistant.
[26–30]. In the present study, we provide direct evidence
that cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells possess stem
cell-like properties. We confirmed the stem cell-like
characteristics of resistant cells by detecting both the cell
surface marker CD117/Stro-1 and stemness-related genes.
We also tested the stemness of resistant cells by functional
assays, which include spheroid formation and in vivo
engraftment capacity.
Recent studies have linked EMT with the
acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics [31–33].
For example, in breast cancer the EMT state has been
associated with cancer stem cell properties including the
expression of stem cell-associated CD44+/CD24-/low
antigenic profile, self-renewal capabilities and resistance
to conventional therapies [34–36]. Our previous study has
shown that mesenchymal-derived osteosarcoma did not
express epithelial markers, however, osteosarcoma stem
cells express more mesenchymal markers and showed
higher motility [13]. Consistent with this, we showed
that resistant cells exhibited an altered morphology with
increased long/short axis ratio and elevated expression of
mesenchymal markers.
Previous data also implies that Notch signaling is
involved in cisplatin-induced enrichment of CSCs [37].

Targeted inactivation of Notch signaling
eliminates CSCs and overcomes drug resistance
To investigate whether targeted inhibition of the
Notch signaling pathway could reverse cisplatin resistance
and decrease osteosarcoma stem cells, we treated cells
with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). RO4929097 and
DAPT (20μM) did not alter Notch transcriptional activity
and target gene expression in vehicle cells, but treatment
decreased Notch activity by almost half in resistant cells
(Figure 5A and 5B). Pretreatment with GSIs alone did
not significantly alter sphere formation capacity or the
ratio of CD117/Stro-1 double positive cells compared
to control treatment. In contrast, pretreatment with
GSIs (20μM) significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced
sarcosphere formation (Figures 5C and 5D), enrichment
of Stro-1/CD117 cells (Figures 5E and 5F), and expression
of stem-like cell markers, including Oct4 and Sox2
(Supplementary Figure S4A).
We then evaluated the effect of GSIs on the
regulation of cisplatin-induced CSCs and resistance in vivo.
Chemoresistant xenografts were treated with DAPT (Figure
6A), which prevented in vivo regrowth after cisplatin
clearance. In vivo DAPT treatment of chemoresistant
xenografts decreased sarcosphere formation ex vivo
from 2.9±0.5% to 1.5±0.2% (P<0.05) (Figure 6B). The
expression of stem-like cell markers were also decreased
by DAPT treatment in vivo (Supplementary Figure S4B).
Finally, NICD1 expression was analyzed and shown
to decrease from 22.4±4.2% to 14.8±2.5% after DAPT
administration (P<0.01) (Figure 5C), confirming that the
inhibitory effect was via the Notch pathway.

DISCUSSION
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma
leads to tumor regression, but is frequently followed
by resistance [24]. So far, signaling pathways activated
by cisplatin treatment have not been fully elucidated.

Notch is a conserved pathway that has been implicated
in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by regulation of
self-renewal and cell-fate determination in normal stem
cells and early progenitors [38]. Recent studies have found
that the Notch pathway is malfunctioned in osteosarcoma
[18–20]. Our data showed that the Notch signaling
pathway, and Notch1 in particular, plays a key role in
the maintenance of osteosarcoma stem cells and cisplatin
chemoresistance. We found that intercellular domains

of Notch receptors, especially NICD1, were increased
in chemoresistant cells, suggesting increased Notch
activation. GSIs are commonly used as Notch pathway
specific inhibitors, and various studies have confirmed the
feasibility of using GSIs for targeting cancer stem cells
[39–42]. In the present study, when the Notch pathway
was blocked by GSIs we observed a significant depletion
in sphere formation cells. Similarly, inhibition of the
Notch pathway sensitized osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin

treatment in vivo, further validating our hypothesis that
the activation of Notch is necessary for the maintenance
of osteosarcoma stem cells and cisplatin chemoresistance.
The relationship between cisplatin responses and
Notch signaling is unclear. It has recently been reported
that Notch negatively regulates the DNA-damage
response, by binding to and inactivating ATM kinase.
[43]. These data suggest that cisplatin removes cisplatinsensitive cells and selects for cisplatin-resistant Notch
positive cells. Other studies have shown that p53 is located
upstream of Notch1, and Notch1 exerts a p53-dependent
protective function against DNA damage through
suppression of FOXO3 [44]. These data imply that p53
may be an intermediate between cisplatin effects and the
activation of Notch signaling pathway.
Together, our studies show that cisplatin-resistant
osteosarcoma cells possess stem cell-like properties and
activated Notch signaling (Figure 6D). The data partially
explain the high recurrence rate and chemo-resistance in
patients receiving cisplatin-based treatment. Based on our
results, we believe that inhibiting the Notch pathway could
be a potential strategy in targeting osteosarcoma stem cells
and overcoming cisplatin chemoresistance in a clinical
setting (Figure 6E).

by MNNG/HOS and 143B cells, and another two
secondary lung metastasis to osteosarcomas are included
in the analysis. GSE39057 contains gene expression data
from 5 unique pairs of diagnostic biopsy and surgical
resection specimens. GEO2R was used to compare two or
more groups of samples in order to identify genes that are
differentially expressed across experimental conditions.

Cell culture
The human osteosarcoma cell lines 143B, U2OS
and MG63 were obtained from China Centre for Type
Culture Collection (CCTCC) (Wuhan, China). 143B
cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin
100 U/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml). U2OS and MG63
cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and
1% antibiotics. Cells were propagated in a humidified
environment at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity.
Cell viability was determined using Trypan blue staining.
Culture medium was replaced every three days.

Generation of stably transfected cell lines
The
pGreenFire1-Notch-EF1-Puro
lentiviral
reporter vector (TR020PA-P) and packaging vectors
were purchased from SBI (System Bioscience, Mountain
View, CA). HEK293-T cells were transfected with the
constructs and viral supernatants obtained. To generate
stably expressing reporter cell lines, osteosarcoma cells
were infected with the viral supernatant and cells selected
with puromycin (5μg/ml).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
15 patients with osteosarcoma were enrolled in this
study. Patients were diagnosed between January 2009
and December 2011 at the Department of Orthopedic
Oncology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute
with approval of Institutional Review Board (2015YW12).
These patients received combination chemotherapy
of cisplatin, methotrexate and doxorubicin for 2 to 4
cycles according to the guideline of NCCN (National
Comprehensive Cancer Network). We obtained either the
biopsy (before neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or resected
(after neoadjuvant chemotherapy) tumur samples,
clinicopathological features are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. Samples of each patient were paraffinembedded, sectioned, and used for evaluating Hes1
positive cells by immunohistochemistry.

Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay
The cells in each well containing 100 μl medium
were incubated with 10 μl cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) at
37°C for 2 h. The optical density (OD) of each well was
then measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader.

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded at 1000 cells per 60 mm culture
dish and culture medium replaced every three days. After
7 days, the colonies were fixed with methanol and stained
with 1% methylene blue solution. The colonies were
determined by inverted microscope and colonies with a
diameter ≥ 50μm were scored.

Publicly datasets and analysis
Several publicly available datasets (GSE38135,
GSE33458, GSE39057, GEO2R) were analyzed to assess
the potential role of Notch in osteosarcoma stem cells and
chemotherapeutic resistance [23]. GSE38135 contains
expression data from the osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/
HOS that has undergone either sphere culture or normal
cell culture. GSE33458 contains gene expression analysis
from PKH26Hi cells (TICs) and PKH26Lo cells (nonTICs) obtained from five orthotopic bone tumors generated

Tumor spheroid assay
Cells were plated in ultra-low attachment plates at
a density of 2,500 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with B27 supplement, 20 ng/ml human epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and 20 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF). Following culture for 2 weeks, colonies
with a diameter ≥ 50μm were regarded as sarcospheres

of medium. 12 mice were randomly divided into two
groups and injected with 5 x 104 corresponding cells
subcutaneously. When the tumors reached >5mm in
diameter, they were dissociated and underwent serial
transplantation using 5 x 104 cells. To test the efficacy of
DAPT, A total of 8 mice bearing chemoresistant xenograft
tumors (at the end of the 4th week) were randomly divided
into DAPT-treated and vehicle groups, with 4 mice in each
group. DAPT dissolved in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was administered by intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg/d)
every day for 2 weeks. The vehicle group received DMSO.

FACScan analysis
To study Notch activity in individual cells, stably
transfected Notch reporter cell lines were constructed, and
cells were dissociated to single cells to detect the ratio of
GFP positive cells. Cells were harvested and resuspended
in 70% alcohol, then fixed at 4°C for 30min. After
washing in PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein
labelled antibody (STRO-1 and CD117) or isotype control
IgG at 4°C for 30min. Cells were washed again before
analysis using a BD FACScaliber flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). The fluorescent intensities were analyzed
with Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences).

Reverse transcription quantitative real-time
PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy
Plus Mini Kit and the concentration and purity was
determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Reverse
transcription was performed using the TaqMan Reverse
Transcription Reagents. Quantitative real-time PCR
reactions were set up in triplicate and performed on a
7900 PCR machine using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix.
Conditions used for amplification of cDNA fragments
were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification
−95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min. Gene expression levels
were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method and normalised
to the β-actin. The gene specific primers used are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.

Luciferase assay
Cells were transfected with Notch pGreenFireCBF1 reporter (Systembio) and CMV-Renilla luciferase
reporter. Plasmids were incubated with Lipofectamine
2000 at a ratio of 3:1 in OptiMEM for 15 minutes then
the mix was added to the culture media for 48 hours. Cells
were lysed and luminescence was assayed with the DualGlo Luciferase assay system according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence of the firefly luciferase was
normalized to that of the renilla luciferase.

Western-blot analysis

Animals and transplantation assay

Proteins were extracted with Protein Lysis Buffer.
Lysates were centrifuged at 10000g at 4°C for 10min, and
supernatants collected. Protein concentrations were assessed
using the Bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit. Cell lysates
containing 40 μg protein were separated on a 10% SDSPAGE gel and then transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes using a Trans Blot Turbo. Membranes
were blocked in a solution of Tris buffered saline containing
0.05% Tween-20 and 5% skimmed milk for 1h at room
temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight
at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were anti-Hes1 (1:500),
anti-Hey1 (1:500,) and anti-β-actin (1:2000). Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000) were
incubated for 2h at room temperature. Finally, membranes
were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
substrate.

To determine the tumorigenicity in vivo, 6 weeks old
NOD/SCID mice were purchased from and maintained at
the Wuhan University Center for Animal Experiments. The
care and use of animals has been reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) (approval number: S01315022l).
For extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA), live
cells were counted by trypan blue staining, and suspended
in 10μL of 50% Matrigel/PBS. Tumors were grown
following subcutaneous inoculation with 5 × 103 to 5 ×
105 cells. Tumor growth was defined at >5 mm diameter
and mice were monitored for up to 6 months.
For the in vivo resistant model, 5 × 106 cells were
subcutaneously injected and tumours harvested after two
weeks. Tumours were divided into pieces with diameters of
10 mm and transplanted subcutaneously. Mice were treated
with cisplatin (peritoneal injection of 5 mg/kg cisplatin
every four days for 4 weeks) to induce chemoresistance.
As osteosarcoma cells grew rapidly in vivo without
chemotherapy, the tumor fragments of 5mm in diameter
were transplanted to set as control. Tumor volume was
calculated every 3-4 days using the formula: V = length
× (width)2/2. To examine tumorigenicity, cells dissociated
from xenograft tumors (chemoresistant or vehicle) were
counted by trypan blue staining, and suspended in 10μL

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections (5 mm) were dewaxed and
rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by
incubating slides in 10 mmol/L citric buffer (pH 6.0)
and microwaving for 15 minutes. After blocking, slides
were incubated with primary antibody against anti-Hes1
antibody (1:100 dilution), and anti-NICD1 antibody (1:100
dilution) overnight at 4°C, followed by biotin-conjugated
