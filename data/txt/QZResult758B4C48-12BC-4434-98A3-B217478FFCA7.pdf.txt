Topoisomerase I Poisoning Shows Preferential Occurrence
in Genes Encoding Splicing Factors

Abstract
RNA splicing is required to remove introns from pre-mRNA, and alternative splicing generates protein
diversity. Topoisomerase I (Top1) has been shown to be coupled with splicing by regulating serine/
arginine-rich splicing proteins. Prior studies on isolated genes also showed that Top1 poisoning by camptothecin (CPT), which traps Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc), can alter RNA splicing. Here, we tested the effect
of Top1 inhibition on splicing at the genome-wide level in human colon carcinoma HCT116 and breast
carcinoma MCF7 cells. The RNA of HCT116 cells treated with CPT for various times was analyzed with
ExonHit Human Splice Array. Unlike other exon array platforms, the ExonHit arrays include junction probes
that allow the detection of splice variants with high sensitivity and specificity. We report that CPT treatment
preferentially affects the splicing of splicing-related factors, such as RBM8A, and generates transcripts coding
for inactive proteins lacking key functional domains. The splicing alterations induced by CPT are not observed
with cisplatin or vinblastine and are not simply due to reduced Top1 activity, as Top1 downregulation by short
interfering RNA did not alter splicing like CPT treatment. Inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) hyperphosphorylation by 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) blocked the splicing alteration induced
by CPT, which suggests that the rapid Pol II hyperphosphorylation induced by CPT interferes with normal
splicing. The preferential effect of CPT on genes encoding splicing factors may explain the abnormal splicing
of a large number of genes in response to Top1cc. Cancer Res; 70(20); 8055–65. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Alternative splicing is observed with >95% of the genes
(1, 2) and constitutes the main source for protein diversity,
allowing the generation of different proteins from a given
pre-mRNA by the differential use of splice sites (3). Alternative splicing is produced by several mechanisms: exclusion/
inclusion of exons, alternative 3′ splice sites, alternative 5′
splice sites, mutual exclusion of exons, unsplicing of an exon,
multiple promoters, and multiple poly(A) sites (Fig. 1C and
D). Splicing takes place at the pre-mRNA level within spliceosomes, each of which contain around 300 polypeptides and
five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP; ref. 2). In addition, serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) are well-known splicing

regulators (2). The SR proteins activate splicing by binding
exonic splicing enhancers, whereas hnRNPs repress splicing
by binding exonic or intronic splicing silencers (1, 2). In
addition to the SR proteins and the hnRNPs that are ubiquitously expressed, splicing regulators like CELF, Nova, nPTB,
FOX1, FOX2, ESRP1, ESRP2, and nSR100 are tissue-specific (2).
Splicing consists of two transesterification reactions. First,
the hydroxyl of the branch point site attacks the phosphate
of the 5′ splice site, generating a free exon and an intermediate lariat. Second, the hydroxyl of the 5′ splice site attacks
the phosphate of the 3′ splice site, generating the mature
mRNA and a lariat of introns that will be finally eliminated.
Over 70% of the splice events change the protein sequence,
and 19% generate truncated proteins (4).
DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is required to remove DNA
superhelical tensions generated by DNA replication and transcription (5–8). During transcription, positive and negative
DNA supercoilings are produced ahead of and behind the
elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex, respectively
(9). Top1 relaxes both positive and negative supercoilings
by producing transient Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc),
which are Top1-linked DNA single-strand breaks (7, 10).
Several studies have suggested the implication of Top1 in
splicing. First, Rossi and colleagues showed that Top1 can
phosphorylate the SR splicing proteins (11, 12) and that two
domains of Top1 were implicated in this activity: one as an

ATP binding site in the carboxy-terminal region of Top1 and
the other as a binding site for SF2/ASF and a protein kinase
domain in the amino-terminal region of Top1 (12). More recently, this kinase activity of Top1 has been confirmed (13),
and Top1 has been proposed to shift from its classic DNA
relaxation activity to its kinase activity after binding the SR
splicing factors (14, 15). SF2/ASF can interact by its two
RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains with Top1 and inhibit
DNA relaxation by the enzyme (16). Top1 is also important in
the regulation of gene expression by its preferential association with transcriptionally active regions (17–19) and by con-

relaxing activities (20, 21).
Top1 is the target of the plant alkaloid camptothecin
(CPT), and its clinical derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan,
are widely used as anticancer agents (7). CPT and its derivatives are noncompetitive, reversible specific Top1 inhibitors
that prevent DNA religation due to the trapping (poisoning)
of Top1cc (7, 10). Poisoning of Top1 also occurs under normal conditions when the DNA template contains damaged
bases including abasic sites, mismatches, oxidized bases,
or carcinogenic adducts (22, 23). The induction of Top1cc

Top1 Affects the Alternative Splicing of Splicing Factors

by CPT has been shown to affect transcription in several
ways. RNA elongation is rapidly arrested by Top1cc (24) with
reduction of Pol II density at promoter pausing sites (19),
activation of low abundance antisense RNAs (17), and rapid
hyperphosphorylation of Pol II in response to CPT treatment
(25). Pol II hyperphosphorylation is rapidly reversible on CPT
removal or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibition by 5,6dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB; ref. 25).
The induction of Top1cc by CPT has been shown to affect
RNA splicing, but published studies have only been done
on some specific genes (26–29).
Here, we tested the implication of Top1cc in splicing at the
global genome level in human carcinoma cells to determine
whether Top1 inhibition selectively affects particular families
of genes. For this purpose, we used ExonHit arrays. Unlike
arrays that contain only exon probes, the ExonHit arrays also
contain junction probes, which allows the detection and
quantitation of novel splice variants (30).

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and cells
CPT, cisplatin, vinblastine, and DRB were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Human HCT116 and MCF7 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown
in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gemini Bio-Products) at 37°C in 95% air and 5% CO2.
Western blotting and antibodies
Western blotting was performed according to standard
protocols (31). The C21 Top1 mouse monoclonal antibody
was a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng (Yale University,
New Haven, CT). The other primary antibodies used were
anti-Pol II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PS5-Pol II (Abcam),
and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
Cell Signaling).
Short interfering RNA
For Top1 downregulation, cells were transfected with a
short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex (Qiagen) against the
sequence AAGGACTCCATCAGATACTAT from the Top1
mRNA. A negative control siRNA duplex was obtained from
Qiagen (target DNA sequence, AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT). Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of
150,000 cells per well at 16 hours before transfection (31).
Reverse transcription-PCR
Cells were washed in PBS. RNA extraction was performed
with the “Nucleospin RNA II” kit (Macherey-Nagel). The
“OneStep RT-PCR” kit (Qiagen) was used under the following
conditions: 1× buffer, 400 μmol/L of each deoxynucleotide
triphosphate, 0.6 μmol/L of each primer, 2 μL of enzyme
mix, and 1 μg of template RNA in a total volume of 50 μL.
RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 minutes at 50°C; the initial PCR step was activated by heating for 15 minutes at 95°C
before PCR (1-minute denaturation at 94°C, 1-minute annealing at 60°C, 1-minute extension at 72°C, 32 cycles) using a MJ

Research PTC-200 Thermo Cycler (MJ Research). The PCR
products were analyzed on agarose gels. The amplified
DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide, and
fluorescence was detected by video camera imaging using
the Quantity One software (BIO-RAD). Primer sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Probe set annotations and data normalization
ExonHit probe sequences were aligned to known variants
in the SpliceMiner database (32). Exons were numbered consecutively according to genomic position, accounting for
strand. Background subtraction and quantile normalization
of the probes were done using Partek statistical software
(Partek, Inc.). The median polish step was done using R.
A probe is designated “body” or “junction” depending on
whether it interrogates a known exon or an exon-exon boundary. A junction probe is designated “J1” if it interrogates consecutive exons and “J2” if it interrogates a junction which
skips one or more intervening exons.
Principal component analysis
The study design consisted of two controls (c4h, c20h) collected at 4 and 20 hours and five CPT (10 μmol/L) treated
samples (1h, 2h, 4h, 15h, and 20h) collected at 1, 2, 4, 15,
and 20 hours, respectively. The RMA intensity values for both
the body and junction probes were subjected to principal
component analysis (PCA). A biplot of PC1 versus PC2,
accounting for 69% of the total variability, revealed three
clusters composed of control samples (c4h, c20h), early treated (1h, 2h, and 4h), and late treated samples (15h, 20h).
Statistical model
The ExonSVD analysis modifies the traditional three-way
ANOVA model with a new parameter for probe set responsiveness. Unlike the ANOVA model, which is prone to give
false-positive signals for alternative splicing in the presence of “dead” or unresponsive probes, the ExonSVD model
(yijk = μ + A'iDk + Eik + βj(i) + Ck + εijk) includes an explicit
parameter, D, for probe set responsiveness. Also, the
ExonSVD model can handle body and junction probes directly without further elaboration. The body probes primarily
determine the differential expression, whereas the junction
probes, which are sensitive to the varying levels of exon-exon
junctions, are the primary source of information regarding
alternative splicing. The E effect of the model (alternative
splicing effect) is determined as the residual after differential
expression effects are accounted for and is tested for significance to determine whether alternative splicing has occurred. This new model alleviates the need for prefiltering
to eliminate dead and unresponsive probe sets. The P values
for E were calculated using the F distribution where the
degrees of freedom, which depend on the number of exons,
were determined by fitting rational polynomials to the
expected sum of squares in a numerical simulation.
Significance index and event type
We developed a “significance index” calculated as the
negative log10(P) for alternative splicing plus two times the

maximum absolute value of the E term for each gene. Using
this significance index, one can order the entire set of genes
according to evidence for alternative splicing.
For the genes with evidence of alternative splicing, we define events of four types (Exon gained early, Exon lost early,
Exon gained late, and Exon lost late) compared with the control condition. For each interior exon, we interrogate the
junctions between it and its preceding (J1-1st) or its following exon (J1-2nd) and the junction joining the preceding to
the following exon (J2). In some cases, the J2 probe was not
available. In others, other J1 probes were not available, so a
determination of the event could not be made. An event of
certain type was declared if corresponding residuals from the
ExonSVD model satisfied a set of conditions involving the
signs of differences of Eik. For example, for “exon loss early,”
[E(early,J2) − E(c,J2)] > 0, [E(early,J1-1st) − E(c,J1-1st)] < 0 and
[E(early,J1-2nd) − E(c,J1-2nd)] < 0. We also required that the
magnitude of one of the differences be >2-fold. Not all of the
significant genes contained one of these four types of events.

Some had multiple events, and some had both gain and loss
of different exons.
High-Throughput GoMiner (HTGM)
High-Throughput GoMiner (HTGM) leverages the Gene
Ontology (GO) to identify “biological processes” represented
in a list of genes. The HTGM (33) used here is an enhancement of GoMiner that efficiently processes an arbitrary
number of such gene lists. The gene lists obtained from
AnovaSVD were sorted in decreasing order with respect to
the significance index. We submitted the top 998 genes for
HTGM analysis. The HTGM parameters are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
A GO category is considered to be enriched if the number
of changed genes that HTGM assigned to it is greater than
the number expected by chance. The enrichment of a category is considered to be statistically significant if its false
discovery rate (FDR) is less than or equal to a given threshold
(typically 0.10). See ref. 33 for details.

Top1 Affects the Alternative Splicing of Splicing Factors

Genesis clustering program
Clustered image maps (CIM) were produced in our studies
by the Genesis program (33). We chose the Euclidean distance metric and average linkage for hierarchical clustering.
Large generic categories were removed from all CIMs to
facilitate visualization.

Results
Genome-wide analysis of splicing alterations induced
by Top1 poisoning
The ExonHit array allows the analysis of 138,636 splice
events among 20,649 genes. The probes are designed to
mostly recognize two kinds of splicing events: exon skipping
and novel exon (Fig. 1A). The array uses a combination of
exon and junction probes that are targeted inside exon
sequences (probes F, T, and B) and at junctions between
two neighboring exons (probes C, D, and E), respectively
(Fig. 1B). A novel exon (exon gain) is characterized by an increase in the B, C, and D probes and a decrease in the E
probe (Fig. 1C). A skipped exon (exon loss) produces an
increase in the E probe and a decrease in the B, C, and D
probes (Fig. 1D).

To study the effect of Top1 poisoning on splicing, we
purified total RNA from human colon carcinoma HCT116
cells treated with 10 μmol/L CPT for 1, 2, 4, 15, and 20 hours
(Fig. 2A) and performed ExonHit array analysis for each
sample. Control samples were analyzed at 4 and 20 hours
following DMSO treatment (0.1%; the solvent used to dissolve CPT).
The data were analyzed using a new ExonSVD model (see
Materials and Methods; all the data are in GEO; accession
number GSE23677; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE23677). Figure 2B shows the PCA organization of the results with the controls, the early CPT treatment
time points (1h, 2h, and 4h), and the later time points (15h
and 20h) grouping separately. This shows a time-dependent
effect on splicing and a correlation between splicing alterations and CPT treatment. Nine hundred ninety-eight genes
among all the genes analyzed (around 5%) had a significance
index of 6 or greater, indicative of statistically significant
and/or large changes in splicing in response to CPT (Supplementary Table S3). The type of alternative splicing event
could be determined for 50% of the genes (434 genes) and
corresponded to novel exon or exon skipping (Fig. 2C). For
the other 50% of the genes, determination was not possible

due to the complexity of the apparent event or because the
array did not probe the relevant splice junctions. The appearance of novel exon was both an early as well as a late event
(Fig. 2C). On the other hand, exon skipping, in most cases,
was only detectable at the late time treatments with CPT
(15 or 20 hours; Fig. 2C). Next, we wanted to know whether
the splice events occurred in specific regions of the transcript. We divided the 434 genes with splicing alterations into

three groups according to the number of exons contained
in each gene [based on the publicly available Genbank information; 1–10 (103 genes), 11–20 (164 genes), >20 exons (167
genes)]. Splice events occurred all along the transcript
and tended to increase with the length of the transcripts
(Fig. 2D). Multiple events on a same transcript concerned
22% of the short transcripts, 35% of the medium transcripts,
and 45% of the long transcripts. Together, these results

Top1 Affects the Alternative Splicing of Splicing Factors

suggest that splicing alteration occurred both on short and
long transcripts but tended to increase with the length of
the transcript.
To validate the ExonHit genome-wide results, we took 12
genes which ranked near the top of the list of the 998 genes,
according to significance index (Supplementary Table S4)
and performed RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. The RTPCR results were in agreement with the ExonHit results for
>90% of the splice alterations analyzed (see Supplementary
Table S4). Figure 3 showed two examples of exon skipping
for the EIF2S2 and PNN genes. CPT induced the skipping of
exons 4 and 5 in the EIF2S2 transcript. The ExonHit data
showed an increase of the E probe (that links exon 3 to exon
6), and the RT-PCR showed the decrease of the long transcript
(containing exons 4 and 5) following CPT treatment and the
appearance of the short transcript (without exons 4 and 5). For
the PNN transcript, CPT induced the skipping of exon 5 with an
increase of the E probe (that links exon 4 to exon 6) in the
ExonHit analysis. Accordingly, RT-PCR showed a decrease of
the long transcript (containing exon 5) and the appearance
of the short transcript (without exon 5) following CPT treatment. Exon gain was also validated in response to CPT for the
caspase-2 gene (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Splicing alterations are enriched in genes coding for
splicing factors
Next, we tested whether CPT affected the alternative splicing of specific gene families. The 998 differentially spliced
genes were analyzed by GoMiner software (http://discover.
nci.nih.gov/gominer/index.jsp). The categories of genes that
tended to be preferentially affected are listed in Fig. 4 and
Table 1 and include those related to splicing, mitosis, and
methylation. Splicing categories were the most affected by
CPT treatment. Individual splicing events were then further
analyzed for the genes encoding splicing-related factors. The
splicing alterations induced by CPT on the RBM8A, ZRANB2,
BAT1, and SF1 genes were further examined (Supplementary
Table S4; Fig. 5). Kinetic experiments were performed for the
RBM8A and SF1 genes not only in HCT116 cells but also in
human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells treated with CPT. By
RT-PCR, the effect on splicing for RBM8A, which is the skipping of exon 3, was detected early, beginning 1 hour after
CPT treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). Splicing of SF1,
which corresponds to the skipping of exon 4, was detectable
later, at 15 hours of CPT treatment (Fig. 5B). Together, these
results show preferential splicing alterations in the genes
encoding splicing factors by Top1 poisoning.

(Fig. 6A). To test whether the effect of CPT was related to Top1cc
or due to Top1 depletion by its sequestering in Top1cc, we downregulated Top1 using a siRNA (Fig. 6B, right). Downregulation
of Top1 had no effect on alternative splicing of the RBM8A or
SF1 genes (Fig. 6B, left), indicating that the generation of Top1cc
rather than Top1 inactivation is necessary to induce splicing.

Top1 Affects the Alternative Splicing of Splicing Factors

Because Pol II hyperphosphorylation has recently been
reported in response to CPT-induced Top1cc (25) and Pol
II hyperphosphorylation has been implicated in alternative
splicing (34, 35), we tested the relationship between CPTinduced Pol II hyperphosphorylation and splicing alterations.
HCT116 cells were pretreated with DRB, an inhibitor of CDK
(36), before exposing the cells to CPT. DRB pretreatment
completely abrogated the CPT-induced splicing of RBM8A
(Fig. 6C) and caspase-2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Under these
conditions, DRB abrogated CPT-induced Pol II hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 6D; ref. 25). These results suggest a relationship between CPT-induced Pol II hyperphosphorylation and
splicing alterations.

Discussion
This genome-wide analysis study shows that Top1cc alters
the splicing of a large number of genes with a preference for
the genes encoding splicing or splicing-related factors. Previous studies on the splicing effects of Top1 inhibitors focused
on single genes (26–29, 38) and did not reveal the important
contribution of the splicing factor genes as preferential splicing targets for Top1 poisons.
The ExonHit human splice array with its junction probes
enabled the detection of early splice alterations with higher
sensitivity than arrays that display only exons probes (for
instance, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST
array). To detect a new splice event, we find the junction
probes to be more sensitive than the exon probes, allowing
the detection of events with high sensitivity and selectivity
(30). The use of exon probes is sufficient to compare expression levels of alternative transcripts in stable cell lines where
transcripts are stably produced; however, to study the
changes in splicing following acute treatments, it is mostly
the junction probes that allowed the detection of new variants because of the long half-life of most basal transcripts
(median half-life ≈ 10 hours; ref. 39). Effectively, in the analysis of our ExonHit data, the junction probes were critical
to identify the appearance of new splice events by the detection of change (mostly an increase) in E or C and D probes
(see Fig. 1).

Among the splicing factors that were abnormally spliced in
response to CPT, three of them exemplify the functional
effect of CPT treatment. RBM8A is a RNA-binding motif
protein present in intermediate-containing spliceosomes.
RBM8A is a component of a splicing-dependent multiprotein
exon junction complex deposited at splice junction on mRNA
(40, 41). It influences downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation
efficiency, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The RBM8A
polypeptide contains a 90–amino acid RRM that binds singlestranded RNA and contains two highly conserved short
sequences, RNP1 and RNP2, that are crucial for RNA binding
(42). In response to CPT, the skipping of exon 3 removes the
RNP2 domain, resulting in a truncated RRM (without RNP2)
that is predicted to inactivate RBM8A. Similarly, ZRANB2
(43), which interacts with the U2 small nRNA auxiliary factor
and SNRP70, has its zf-RanBP (zinc finger Ran binding protein) domain missing due to the skipping of exon 4 after CPT
treatment. We also found that BAT1 (44), a splicing factor
required for the association of U2 snRNP with pre-mRNA
and mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, has
its DEAD domain truncated due to the skipping of exons 3
and 5 after CPT treatment. These results illustrate how CPT,
by affecting key functional domains of splicing factors that
are important for their binding with RNA or other splicingrelated factors, can inactivate these splicing factors and consequently affect in “trans” the splicing of other genes.
The exposure of HCT116 cells to 10 μmol/L CPT during
20 hours does not generate a significant amount of apoptosis.
The level of apoptosis measured by Hoechst staining was below
10%. Moreover, we previously observed that pretreatment, by
the broad caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, does not suppress
the effect of CPT on the splicing of caspase-2 (29). Also, many
of the changes observed at 20 hours were already readily
detectable at early time (1 hour). Consequently, the changes
observed concerning alternative splicing do not mainly reflect
the cells going through the process of dying.
Top1 poisoning by CPT and anticancer drugs, abasic sites,
base mismatches, oxidized bases, carcinogenic adducts, and
strand breaks can deplete Top1 activity by sequestering Top1
in the cleavage complexes (7, 22, 23). However, it is well

established that the anticancer cytotoxic activity of CPT is
not due to the depletion of Top1 activity but rather to the
trapping of Top1cc and subsequent effects of DNA replication and transcription (8, 45). Similarly, our Top1 depletion
experiments with siRNA show that the splicing effects of CPT
are Top1cc-dependent but are probably unrelated to the
depletion of Top1 catalytic activity. We recently reported
the rapid induction of Pol II hyperphosphorylation in response to CPT-induced Top1cc (25). In this study, we confirmed Pol II hyperphosphorylation after CPT treatment.
Pretreatment with DRB, which inhibits CDK (25) and suppresses Pol II hyperphosphorylation (see Fig. 6; ref. 25), abrogated the splicing effects of CPT. It is plausible that CPT
alters splicing in response to Pol II hyperphosphorylation
(see Fig. 7), which has been proposed to affect Pol II pausing
and the selection of splicing sites (34). Similarly, Munoz and
colleagues showed that UVC affects splicing by inducing Pol
II hyperphosphorylation and slowing down Pol II elongation
(35), which can favor the use of weak splice sites (34, 46).
The poisoning of Top1cc by CPT can affect splicing by such
a “kinetic coupling model” (47). However, it is also possible
that hyperphosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain
of Pol II affects its interaction with and recruitment of splicing factors as proposed in the “recruitment coupling model”
(48, 49). In summary, transcription could regulate alternative

splicing by modulation of Pol II elongation rates (kinetic coupling; ref. 47) and by association of splicing factors to the
transcribing polymerase (recruitment coupling; ref. 50). Our
finding that the genes encoding splicing factors are preferentially altered can explain the effect of Top1cc on the splicing
of a large variety of genes.
