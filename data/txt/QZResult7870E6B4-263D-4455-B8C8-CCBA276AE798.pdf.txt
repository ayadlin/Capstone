Abstract
Targeting constitutively activated FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 [(FLT3); FLT3-ITD] with tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leads to clearance of blasts in the periphery but not in
the bone marrow, suggesting a protective effect of the marrow niche on leukemic stem cells. In this study, we
examined the effect of stromal niche cells on CD34þ progenitors from patients with FLT3-ITDþ or wild-type
FLT3 (FLT3-WT) AML treated with the TKIs SU5614 or sorafenib. TKIs effectively and specifically inhibited FLT3
and increased the fraction of undivided progenitors in both FLT3-ITDþ and FLT3-WT samples. Treatment with
SU5614 and sorafenib also reduced the number of mature leukemic progenitors, whereas contact with stroma
protected against this cell loss. In contrast, primitive long-term progenitors from both FLT3-ITDþ and FLT3-WT
AML were resistant to TKIs. Additional contact with niche cells significantly expanded long-term FLT3-ITDþ but
not FLT3-WT progenitors in the presence of SU5614 but not that of sorafenib. Thus, TKIs with first-generation
inhibitors fail to eradicate early leukemic stem/progenitor cells in FLT3-ITDþ AML. Further, we defined a
specific interaction between FLT3-ITDþ progenitors and niche cells that enables the maintenance of leukemic
progenitors in the presence of TKI. Collectively, our findings suggest that molecular therapy may have
unpredicted effects on leukemic progenitors, underscoring the necessity of developing strategies to selectively
eliminate the malignant stem cell clone. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4696–706. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is organized as a hierarchy
resembling normal hematopoiesis with leukemic stem cells
(LSC) responsible for producing the bulk of leukemic blasts
and sustaining the disease by their ability to self-renew (1, 2).
Conventional chemotherapy induces high rates of remission
but cures only a small percentage of patients with AML (3).
The persistence of LSCs in the bone marrow after chemotherapy is thought to be responsible for the high rate of relapse (4,
5). Therefore, new strategies to eradicate residual LSCs are
urgently needed. Targeting key signaling pathways with small
molecule inhibitors is one therapeutic approach currently
being evaluated.

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine
kinase overexpressed on leukemic blasts in almost all cases
of AML (6). Activating mutations in the FLT3 gene in the
form of internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) can be
identified in one third of AML patients and are associated
with poor prognosis and increased relapse rates (7, 8). These
mutations induce constitutive tyrosine kinase activity in the
absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) and confer growth factor
independence, proliferation, and survival to myeloid cells
in mouse models. Introduction of FLT3-ITD into murine
bone marrow induces myeloproliferative disease, indicating
the importance of FLT3 mutations in malignant transformation (9–11). FLT3-ITD mutations were shown to be present
in primitive human CD34þCD38 cells, showing that the
mutation can occur within the hematopoietic stem cell
compartment (12). Moreover, detection of FLT3-ITD in
the CD34þCD33 stem/progenitor cell fraction in children
with FLT3-ITDþ AML was associated with a particularly
poor prognosis (13). Thus, targeting FLT3-ITD may improve
prognosis by enabling eradication of leukemic CD34þ stem/
progenitor cells. Indeed, inhibition of constitutively active
FLT3 has been shown to prolong survival in a mouse model
of FLT3-ITDþ leukemia (14, 15) and several tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) have entered clinical trials (16–18). However, although inhibition of mutant FLT3 leads to clearance
of leukemic blasts in the periphery, the bone marrow often
remains unchanged and remissions are usually short-lived

embryonic stromal cell line EL08-1D2 was used as an in vitro
model for the stem cell niche (23).

(17, 19), raising the question whether a protective effect of
the marrow niche on LSCs exists.
The stem cell niche of the bone marrow provides a supportive microenvironment for normal hematopoietic stem
cells (20, 21) and regulates the balance between self-renewal
and differentiation in the stem cell pool (20). Newer data
suggest that LSCs are also protected by the stem cell niche and
may even manipulate the microenvironment to their advantage (21, 22). If so, the interaction between leukemic FLT3ITDþ stem/progenitors and the niche may influence the
efficacy of TKI on these cells. We addressed this question
by investigating the effects of the TKIs SU5614 and sorafenib
on leukemic CD34þ stem/progenitor cells from AML patients
with wild-type (FLT3-WT) or mutated (FLT3-ITD) FLT3

Materials and Methods
Bone marrow samples
Bone marrow samples were obtained from patients
recruited to the German AMLSG trials between 2002 and
2010 (Table 1). Written informed consent in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all patients
prior to bone marrow aspiration according to a protocol
approved by the local Ethics Committee. All patients were
newly diagnosed and untreated. Bone marrow samples

underwent standardized processing including cytogenetics,
FISH, and molecular genetics. All samples were screened for
the presence of FLT3-ITD mutation as recently described
(24) as well as for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of
FLT3 (FLT3-TKD), partial tandem duplications of the MLL
gene (MLL-PTD), and mutations of the nucleophosmin
gene (NPM).
Cell isolation, enrichment, and CFSE staining
Mononuclear cells were enriched for CD34þ cells by magnetic selection as described by the manufacturer (Miltenyi
Biotech). Enriched cells were analyzed for expression of CD34
and, in some cases, CD38 and FLT3 (CD135). Purity of CD34þenriched cells ranged from 87% to 98%. Further lineage
depletion of CD34þ cells was not done because of primary
sample size constraints. In some experiments, CD34-enriched
cells were labeled for 10 minutes at 37 C with 2 mmol/L of the
fluorescent dye 5-(and 6-)carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl
ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes) in Iscove's modified
Dulbecco's medium (GIBCO; Invitrogen), 1% fetal calf serum,
and 10 mmol/L HEPES (Gibco) as described (25). To determine the location of undivided cells for cell division tracking, a
control culture was set up in the same manner but was
additionally supplemented with colcemid (Karyomax; Gibco)
as described (26). Stromal cell lines FBMD-1 and EL08-1D2
were cultured as described (23). The RS4;11 and MV4-11
human leukemia cell lines were obtained from and propagated
as suggested by the German Collection of Microorganisms and
Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and were authenticated by DSMZ by
DNA typing and PCR analysis as well as cytogenetic testing.
Cells used for all experiments were passaged for fewer than
6 months after receipt.
Culture of CD34þ progenitor cells from primary AML
samples
CD34þ progenitors from AML bone marrow samples were
cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with 5 growth
factors (5GF): kit ligand (KL), FL, thrombopoietin (TPO),
interleukin (IL)-3, and Hyper-IL-6, a designer cytokine consisting of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (H-IL-6; a kind gift
from S. Rose-John, Kiel, Germany; ref. 27). Cells were cultured
in suspension or on confluent EL08-1D2 stromal cells and
treated with SU5614, sorafenib, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as indicated. Cells were maintained at 37 C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 4 days, cells were harvested
and assayed for short- and long-term hematopoietic activity.
Analysis of apoptosis in CD34þ cells
CD34þ bone marrow cells were cultured in serum-free
medium with 5GF and DMSO or SU5614. After the indicated
time, cells were harvested and stained for Annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) as described by the manufacturer
(ApoTest-FITC; Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed in
PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, resuspended in PBS buffer containing RNAse (100 mg/mL) and PI
(50 mg/mL), followed by flow cytometry done on an Epics XL
cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Acquired data were analyzed
using FlowJo Software (version 8.7.3 for Macintosh).

Hematopoietic progenitor cell clonogenic assays
Mature hematopoietic progenitors were assessed by colony
formation before and after 4 days of 5GF-supplemented serumfree culture. A total of 1,000 to 5,000 input cell equivalents were
plated in growth factor-supplemented methylcellulose (H4435;
Stem Cell Technologies) and incubated at 37 C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 14 days, colony-forming units
(CFU) were scored using standard criteria.
Immature hematopoietic stem/progenitors were determined after long-term culture on the FBMD-1 stromal cell
line in the presence of TPO and FL as described (25). After
6 weeks of culture, the entire culture was harvested by trypsin
detachment and assayed for the presence of long-term, culturederived colony-forming cells (LTC-CFC) in methylcellulose.
PCR for FLT3
AML bone marrow samples were validated for the presence
of FLT3-ITD by PCR after isolation of mononuclear cells, as well
as after both CD34 enrichment and culture in methylcellulose.
For PCR from hematopoietic colonies, single hematopoietic
colonies were picked from methylcellulose. Total genomic
DNA was isolated using the QiaAmp Micro Kit (Qiagen) and
eluted into 30 mL TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer. Eight microliters of
single colony-derived genomic DNA was amplified by FLT3ITD PCR. Products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and
visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining.
Western blot analysis
MV4-11 or RS4;11 cells or primary CD34þ cells were starved
overnight in suspension culture or on the stromal cell line
EL08-1D2 at 37 C in 5% CO2. Cells were incubated with
SU5614 (5 mmol/L), sorafenib (100 nmol/L), or DMSO at
37 C and 5% CO2 for indicated time periods. Cells were placed
in pre-chilled tubes containing ice-cold PBS with Na2VO4
(1 mmol/L; Sigma) and washed once in cold PBS with Na2VO4.
Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were done as
described (25). Antibodies to FLT3 (S-18, sc-480; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and pFLT3 (#3461; Cell Signaling Technologies), AKT1/pS473 and AKT1/pT308 AKT (all from Cell Signaling Technologies), ERK1 (K-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
pY204-ERK1 (E4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), b-actin (Sigma),
pY694STAT5 and STAT5 (Cell Signaling Technologies), and
phosphotyrosine (4G10 and PY20; Transduction Laboratories)
were used as described in manufacturers’ instructions. Signals
were visualized on Kodak films, using polyclonal secondary
horseradish peroxidase–labeled antibodies (Pierce) and
enhanced chemoluminescence (Pierce). Band intensities were
determined using the ImageJ software package (NIH).
ELISA for FL
Levels of murine and human FL in stroma coculture were
measured using species-specific Quantikine ELISA kits for
murine (MFK00) and human FL (DFK00) following the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems).
Statistics
For analysis of functional assays of patient samples, we used
nonparametric tests for both unpaired (between WT and ITD)

mutation (Fig. 2A). Proliferation of MV4-11 cells was inhibited
by SU5614, whereas growth of RS4;11 cells was not affected.
Ligand stimulation did not increase susceptibility of RS4;11
cells to SU5614, whereas inhibition of MV4-11 cells by SU5614
was partially overcome by stimulation with FL. Constitutively
active FLT3-ITD in MV4-11 cells was completely inhibited by
treatment with SU5614 (Fig. 2B). Direct contact of leukemic
cells with EL08-1D2 stromal cells did not significantly influence
FLT3 activation or its inhibition by SU5614.
In primary CD34þFLT3-ITDþ cells, induction of apoptosis
by SU5614 was moderate (Fig. 2C) whereas apoptosis induction in CD34þFLT3-WT cells was not statistically significant
(Fig. 2C). Culture of primary leukemic CD34þ cells on EL081D2 stroma prevented SU5614-induced apoptosis. This was
not observed for MV4-11 cells (Fig. 2C).

and paired (within either WT or ITD) comparisons. For
unpaired comparisons, we used the Mann–Whitney U test;
for paired samples, the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank
test was used. To test for possible differences between groups
in other experiments, we used the paired t test. Statistical
testing was done using InStat software (GraphPad Software).

Results
Characteristics of AML patient samples
The characteristics of AML bone marrow samples used in
this study are summarized in Table 1. A total of 21 AML
samples harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation were analyzed and
compared with 13 AML samples without the mutation (FLT3WT). The majority of samples (23 of 34) had normal cytogenetics. With the exception of sample 2, which additionally
harbored an MLL-PTD mutation, and samples 10 to 12 and 20,
21, 27, which were NPM mutated, none of the other molecular
abnormalities routinely screened for were detected in the
remaining 27 AML samples. Primary FLT3-ITDþ AML samples
showed variable expression of CD34 (Table 1), CD38 and FLT3
receptor (CD135), as shown in Figure 1. Enrichment for CD34
by magnetic bead isolation was successful in all samples.

FLT3-ITD–specific downstream signaling is uncoupled
from FLT3-ITD in leukemic CD34þ cells
Phosphorylation of FLT3 in CD34þFLT3-ITDþ AML cells
was suppressed by treatment with SU5614 (Fig. 3A), confirming inhibition of the target mutation in primary leukemic cells.
Coculture on EL08-1D2 stroma partially overcame inhibition
of phosphorylation by SU5614 (Fig. 3A and B). We therefore
looked downstream from FLT3 to investigate whether signaling differences occurred during coculture on stroma. Of
particular interest was STAT5, whose phosphorylation
and subsequent activation is a hallmark of the oncogenic
FLT3-ITD pathway (29, 30). In MV4-11 cells, SU5614 inhibited
phosphorylation of STAT5 in suspension and when cocultured
with EL08-1D2 (Fig. 3C and D). Phosphorylation of both T308

been shown to effectively inhibit FLT3-ITD and activated
FLT3-WT kinase (28). We confirmed the selective inhibitory

and S473 AKT and ERK was also inhibited by SU5614 (Fig. 3D).
In EL08-1D2 stromal cells analyzed as a control, both AKT
phosphorylation sites were found to be constitutively phosphorylated and were not inhibited by SU5614 (Fig. 3D).
In untreated AML patient samples, activated STAT5 was
more readily detectable in CD34þFLT3-ITDþ cells (7 of 7
samples) than FLT3-WT cells (4 of 7 samples) and was not
inhibited by SU5614 (Fig. 3C and E). In CD34þFLT3-ITDþ cells
cultured in suspension, SU5614 inhibited phosphorylation of
AKT (at T308) and ERK whereas phosphorylation of AKT at
S473 was not affected (Supplementary Fig. S3). Coculture on
EL08-1D2 cells did not influence signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 in either CD34þFLT3-ITDþ or FLT3-WT cells
(Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, while SU5614
inhibits FLT3 and T308AKT and ERK pathways, STAT5 and
S473AKT phosphorylation seem to be uncoupled from FLT3ITD activation status in primary leukemic CD34þ cells.
SU5614 increases the fraction of undivided leukemic
CD34þ cells
Analysis of primary CD34þ AML cells revealed the majority
to be in G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle after 4 days of growth
factor stimulation (data not shown), precluding detection of

although one mechanism of action for TKI is cell-cycle arrest,
this effect is not readily detectable in primary CD34þ cells. We
reasoned that an analysis of cell division might provide a
better discrimination of TKI effect. Cell division was indeed
detectable by CFSE staining, with the majority of samples
dividing once during the 4-day period. FLT3-ITDþ AML
samples contained a significantly higher proportion of cells
that did not divide during the 4-day culture than did FLT3-WT
samples (Supplementary Fig. S1). Treatment with SU5614
significantly increased the fraction of nondividing cells in
both FLT3-ITDþ and FLT3-WT samples. This effect was
almost completely reversed by coculture with EL08-1D2
stroma for CD34þFLT3-WT cells but not for CD34þFLT3ITDþ cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
TKI eradicates short-term committed leukemic
progenitor cells, but stromal contact counteracts this
effect
Next, we investigated hematopoietic activity of primary
CD34þ AML bone marrow cells cultured for 4 days in the
presence or absence of SU5614 with or without EL08-1D2 cells.
The 4-day incubation period was chosen, as this is the time
period within which progenitors undergo at least 1 division
but do not lose CD34 expression, as we have shown for normal

with published observations (26). Treatment with SU5614
reduced committed progenitors in suspension culture by
77% for FLT3-ITDþ and 44% for FLT3-WT samples, showing
that SU5614 targets committed leukemic progenitors (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Table S1). Direct contact with EL08-1D2
did not significantly enhance expansion of committed CFU in
either FLT3-ITDþ or FLT3-WT AML samples. However, culture with EL08-1D2 stromal cells completely abrogated the
inhibitory effect of SU5614 on leukemic progenitor cell growth
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S1). Production of FL by
either EL08-1D2 stromal cells or autocrine secretion of FL by
AML cells was not responsible for the protective effect of
stroma, as neither murine nor human FL was secreted at
detectable levels in coculture (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Inhibition of activated FLT3 by SU5614 does not
eradicate primitive leukemic progenitors in FLT3-ITDþ
or FLT3-WT AML
To address the question whether inhibition of activated
FLT3 can effectively target the most primitive leukemic progenitor cell population, we conducted long-term in vitro
culture experiments, resulting in a functional readout for
the early progenitor cell fraction (31). As shown in Figure
4B and Supplementary Table S2, the number of more primitive
LTC-CFCs was very heterogeneous within untreated FLt3ITDþ and FLT3-WT samples and not statistically different
between the two groups. Exposure to SU5614 over 4 days in
suspension culture did not eliminate primitive leukemic progenitors, either in FLT3-ITDþ or FLT3-WT samples (Fig. 4B
and C, Supplementary Table S 2).
Early FLT3-ITDþ stem/progenitor cells protected by
stromal niche cells are amplified by treatment with
SU5614
To determine the contribution of stromal support on
maintenance of leukemic LTC-CFCs, we assessed the effect
of SU5614 on primitive CD34þ progenitors cultured on EL081D2 stroma. We have previously shown that this murine
embryonic stromal cell line supports long-term production
of both mature and immature human hematopoietic progenitors and can therefore mimic the stem cell niche in vitro (23,
32). Culture on EL08-1D2 effectively prevented loss of FLT3ITDþ LTC-CFCs during the 4-day in vitro culture (Fig. 4B). In
contrast, there was no significant difference in the number of
LTC-CFCs between suspension cultures and stromal supported cultures for FLT3-WT samples (Fig. 4B). Absolute
colony numbers from all bone marrow samples are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
An unexpected finding was the expansion of LTC-CFCs in
the context of stromal support and treatment with SU5614 in
FLT3-ITDþ AML samples. As depicted in Figure 4B, LTC-CFCs
were expanded 3.5-fold compared with day 0 in the presence
of EL08-1D2 and SU5614. Compared with progenitors cultured
on stroma without TKI, expansion of LTC-CFCs was 2.6-fold in
the presence of SU5614. The increase in LTC-CFCs on stroma
in the presence of SU5614 was observed for 8 of 9 FLT3-ITDþ
patient samples, ruling out the possibility of singular outliers
distorting the overall results. To better assess the contribution

www.aacrjournals.org

of EL08-1D2 stroma to stimulation of leukemic progenitors, a
ratio between colony numbers for SU5614-treated versus
DMSO-treated cultures was formed. As shown in Figure 4C,
stromal support led to significant stimulation of colony
growth in FLT3-ITDþ progenitors whereas this was not the
case for FLT3-WT progenitor cells, indicating that stromal
support is necessary for expansion of FLT3-ITDþ progenitors.
Expanded LTC-CFCs are of leukemic origin
Because primitive AML progenitors are thought to have a
growth advantage over their normal counterparts (33), we
sought to ascertain whether expanded LTC-CFCs from FLT3ITDþ samples were of leukemic origin or whether stromal
contact conferred a survival advantage to healthy progenitor
cells. PCR for FLT3-ITD in individual hematopoietic colonies
from methylcellulose confirmed the presence of the FLT3
mutation in LTC-CFCs from all patient samples (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating persistence of early leukemic progenitors.
Confirmatory studies with sorafenib
To confirm the general applicability of our findings, we
repeated key experiments with a second TKI, sorafenib. This
compound is a more selective and potent inhibitor of FLT3
than SU5614 and is currently widely used in the clinic (34–36).
As shown in Figure 5A, sorafenib effectively inhibited activated FLT3 in WT as well as FLT3-ITDþ AML. Inhibition of
FLT3 phosphorylation by sorafenib was not influenced by
stromal contact. As with SU5614, STAT5 signaling downstream of FLT3-ITD was not inhibited by sorafenib
(Fig. 5B), confirming uncoupling of FLT3-ITD and STAT5 in
primary CD34þFLT3-ITDþ AML cells.
Colony-forming assays revealed that similar to SU5614,
treatment with sorafenib did not eliminate short- or longterm leukemic progenitors (Fig. 5C). Coculture with EL08-1D8
stromal cells again abolished the inhibitory effect of sorafenib,
although expansion of progenitor cells was not statistically
significant. Analysis of colonies by PCR again confirmed that a
substantial number of colonies recovered from short- and
long-term cultures contained the FLT3-ITD mutation despite
treatment with sorafenib (Supplementary Fig. S4E).

Discussion
Despite entry of FLT3 inhibitors into clinical trials for FLT3ITDþ AML, it has so far not been established whether inhibition of aberrant FLT3 signaling can actually eradicate the
earliest stem/progenitor cells responsible for propagating the
disease. We showed, using the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614 and
sorafenib as proof of concept, in primary bone marrow
samples from patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITDþ
AML that treatment with TKI does not eliminate early leukemic CD34þFLT3-ITDþ stem/progenitor cells. In addition,
we show a protective effect of the stromal microenvironment
on these cells, conferring a growth advantage to FLT3-ITDþ
leukemic progenitors over normal ones in the presence of TKI.
We show that primary early leukemic CD34þFLT3-ITDþ
progenitors are insensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TKI. The

majority of CD34þFLT3-ITDþ cells divided upon cytokine
stimulation in vitro, with 50% of cells undergoing at least
1 cell division within 4 days. Treatment with SU5614 significantly increased the fraction of undivided cells, suggesting
that the predominant effect of the inhibitor on this population
is a decrease in cell division and not induction of cell death.
The inherent unresponsiveness of early FLT3-ITDþ leukemic progenitors to TKI may be due to the fact that they are not
dependent on mutant FLT3 signaling for survival. In contrast
to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), more than 1 genetic
alteration is necessary to cause AML. Therefore, inhibiting
activated FLT3 kinase may not be sufficient to eliminate the
stem cell fraction or FLT3-ITD may not be the relevant target
in these early cells. For CML, it has been elegantly shown that
primitive CD34þ stem/progenitors are insensitive to first- and
second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors and are instead induced
into quiescence by treatment with TKI (37, 38). Our results
suggest that this principle may also be true for primitive FLT3ITDþ progenitors from AML. This counterproductive effect on
leukemic stem/progenitor cells has also been reported for

4704

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

other novel treatment strategies in AML, such as the histone
deacetylase inhibitor valproate (39).
An alternative explanation may be that current TKIs are not
effective enough to completely prevent constitutive activation of FLT3. Because it has been suggested that complete and
enduring inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation is critical for
achieving clinical efficacy (40, 41), failure to completely inhibit
FLT3 may contribute to persistence of leukemic progenitors
after treatment. However, to our knowledge, it has not yet
been definitively shown that complete inhibition of FLT3
actually translates into improved clinical outcome in FLT3ITDþ AML. Increased allelic ratios of FLT3-ITD to WT receptor have also been linked to poor prognosis (42). In our small
cohort, we could not observe a correlation between allelic
ratio and outcome of progenitor assays.
In addition, continued activation of signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 through other mechanisms may contribute to
TKI resistance in CD34þFLT3-ITDþ progenitors. Our results
show uncoupling of FLT3-ITD from STAT5 signaling in primary
CD34þFLT3-ITDþ cells in the presence of TKI. Activation of

Niche Protection in FLT3-ITDþ AML

STAT5 by FLT3 has been shown to be dependent on intracellular
localization of the receptor (30), thus restricted to mutated FLT3
and not found in FLT3-WT signaling. In addition, FLT3-ITD
itself has recently been shown to be differentially phosphorylated on different tyrosine residues in a compartment-dependent manner (30). In this context, our results suggest that
inhibition of mutated FLT3 by TKI in primary patient samples
may take place mainly at the plasma membrane, allowing
intracellular activation of STAT5 to persist.
Our data extend findings previously obtained using leukemic
cell lines with acquired resistance to TKI showing continued
STAT5 activation in resistant cells (43, 44). Prolonged exposure
of leukemic cell lines or AML blasts to TKI opts for cells that are
FLT3 independent, leading to pharmacologic resistance (35, 43,
44). However, our results suggest that at least primitive
CD34þFLT3-ITDþ progenitors are insensitive to TKI from
the onset of treatment. The inability of TKI to sustain suppression of leukemic blasts may therefore be due not only to
outgrowth of resistant blasts but also to the fact that the more
primitive leukemic stem/progenitors maintaining the disease
persist despite treatment with TKI. Thus, our data offer an
additional explanation to the transient clinical responses seen
so far with TKI in FLT3-ITDþ AML. However, these results
should be interpreted with caution, as third-generation FLT3
inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic properties now
entering clinical trials (45) may yield different results.
Finally, we show that interaction of CD34þFLT3-ITDþ
progenitors with stromal niche cells mimicking the bone
marrow environment protects these cells from the effects
of TKI. Because FL was not significantly produced by either
stromal cells or AML cells during coculture, this protective
effect is not dependent on FL in our in vitro system, as has
been observed in vivo in response to chemotherapy (46).
Although similar protective effects of stroma have been
reported for normal progenitors, our observation that the
combination of niche cells and concomitant TKI actually may,
in some instances, even lead to expansion of malignant
progenitors is unexpected. This effect was specific for
FLT3-ITDþ progenitors and not observed for FLT3-WT cells,
pointing to a differential response of FLT3-ITDþ cells to the
niche. However, we did not observe this expansion when
leukemic progenitors were treated with sorafenib. Because
SU5614 and sorafenib show differential inhibitory effects on

FLT3-WT and FLT3-ITD, the difference in observed effects on
long-term CFC-producing cultures may be due to the weaker
efficiency of SU5614 in inhibiting FLT3 or to an altered balance
between inhibition of WT and mutant FLT3. The mechanistic
basis for our finding is still unclear but suggests that the niche
generates specific self-renewal or survival signals, perhaps in
reaction to leukemic cells themselves, to which FLT3-ITDþ
progenitors can uniquely respond.
Taken together, these data highlight the fact that molecular
therapy may have unpredicted effects on leukemic stem/
progenitor cells and underscores the importance of developing strategies to selectively eliminate the malignant stem cell
clone. Our data point to an altered interaction between FLT3ITDþ stem/progenitors and the stem cell niche. To efficiently
target FLT3-ITDþ stem/progenitor cells in AML, future investigations should focus on how the bone marrow microenvironment regulates these cells. Our results suggest that
combining inhibitors to additionally block downstream pathways (e.g., STAT5) or adding agents that disrupt the interaction between LSCs and niche (e.g., CXCR4 antagonists) may be
necessary to overcome the unresponsiveness of FLT3-ITDþ
leukemic stem/progenitor cells to TKI (44, 47). Finally, our
findings have potentially important clinical implications for
the use of TKI to treat FLT3-ITDþ AML, as they raise the
possibility of unwittingly amplifying leukemic stem/progenitor cells.
