Abstract
Elevated oxidative stress is observed more frequently in cancer cells than in normal cells. It is therefore
expected that additional exposure to a low level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will push cancer cells toward
death, whereas normal cells might maintain redox homeostasis through adaptive antioxidant responses. We
previously showed that parthenolide enhances ROS production in prostate cancer cells through activation of
NADPH oxidase. The present study identiﬁes KEAP1 as the downstream redox target that contributes to
parthenolide's radiosensitization effect in prostate cancer cells. In vivo, parthenolide increases radiosensitivity of
mouse xenograft tumors but protects normal prostate and bladder tissues against radiation-induced injury.
Mechanistically, parthenolide increases the level of cellular ROS and causes oxidation of thioredoxin (TrX) in
prostate cancer cells, leading to a TrX-dependent increase in a reduced state of KEAP1, which in turn leads to
KEAP1-mediated PGAM5 and Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) degradation. In contrast, parthenolide increases oxidation of
KEAP1 in normal prostate epithelial cells, leading to increased Nrf2 (NFE2L2) levels and subsequent Nrf2dependent expression of antioxidant enzymes. These results reveal a novel redox-mediated modiﬁcation of
KEAP1 in controlling the differential effect of parthenolide on tumor and normal cell radiosensitivity. Furthermore, they show it is possible to develop a tumor-speciﬁc radiosensitizing agent with radioprotective properties
in normal cells. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4406–17. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
It is well documented that cancer cells are usually under
more oxidative stress than normal cells are, in part, due to a
hyperactive metabolism that fuels their rapid growth (1, 2).
Thus, a therapy designed to increase reactive oxygen species
(ROS) to a level above the threshold for cancer cell death, but to
an adaptable level for normal cells, would be an attractive
strategy to selectively kill cancer cells (3, 4). Redox homeostasis
is thought to regulate many cellular processes that are essential
for maintenance of normal physiologic conditions but is
aberrantly modulated in cancers (5, 6). The functions of
ROS are both beneﬁcial and deleterious due to their dual role
in the prosurvival and antisurvival pathways. As a secondary
messenger in cell signaling, ROS are required for normal
development and can initiate adaptive responses in cellular

defense (7, 8). On the other hand, ROS cause structural damage
and functional decline in DNA, proteins, and lipids, and
consequently act as an antitumorigenic factor by inducing
cell senescence and apoptosis (9, 10). Indeed, ROS-mediated
cell death is an important basis for radiotherapy and many
chemotherapeutic treatments (11, 12). Currently, these therapeutic strategies are being used to kill cancer cells without
beneﬁt of a rational design that exploits the intrinsic differences in the cellular redox status of normal cells and cancer
cells.
Antioxidant defense systems are essential for the regulation of ROS levels, which have an important function in the
maintenance of cellular redox hemostasis. Mounting evidence shows that a decline in antioxidant function may be
involved in tumorigenesis due to prooxidant conditions that
result from ROS accumulation. For example, manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is downregulated in many
types of cancer and overexpression of MnSOD results
in suppression of tumorigenesis (13–15). High levels of
antioxidants caused by therapy-mediated activation of
prosurvival pathways, such as NF-kB and Nrf2, are thought
to protect cancer cells against treatment (16–18). Thus,
inhibition of prosurvival pathways has been a traditional
strategy to enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Increasing evidence shows that certain mild prooxidant
compounds derived from natural herbal medicines might
enhance some anticancer treatments by modulating the

redox state of cancer cells to high prooxidant levels (19, 20).
Parthenolide, an active ingredient derived from the traditional anti-inﬂammatory medical plant feverfew (Tanacetum
parthenium), belongs to the family of sesquiterpene lactones
containing an a-methylene-g-lactone moiety and an epoxide
group, which is able to conjugate thiols of proteins through a
Michael addition reaction (21). In addition to its antiinﬂammatory effect, parthenolide seems to be toxic to a
variety of cancer cells (22–25). Importantly, parthenolide has
no cytotoxic effect on normal cells (25). Mechanistically,
parthenolide has been shown to increase apoptosis in cancer
cells through inhibition of multiple prosurvival pathways,
such as NF-kB and PI3K-AKT (19, 26). However, these
ﬁndings do not explain why parthenolide is not toxic to
normal cells.
Posttranslational modiﬁcation is a key mechanism by which
proteins dramatically increase their functional diversity.
Reversible redox modiﬁcation of protein cysteine residues
plays an important role in vital cell signaling pathways related
to many physiologic and pathogenic processes (27, 28). The
Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is one of the main cellular defense
mechanisms against oxidative stress (29, 30). The present study
examines the role of cysteine modiﬁcations in modulating
radiation responses in prostate cancer cells versus normal
prostate epithelial cells. It elucidates the functional link
between redox modulation and cell signaling transduction
pathways, and it provides evidence for the differential effect
of parthenolide on cellular redox status in normal and cancer
cells. The results reveal that parthenolide-mediated redox
modiﬁcation of Keap1 serves as a central regulator of differential responses to radiotherapy in normal and tumor cells.
The present study provides a proof-of-concept for using an
intrinsic difference in cellular redox conditions to kill tumor
cells while protecting normal cells from the unwanted side
effects of radiation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, cell transfection, treatment, and cell
survival analysis
Human prostate carcinoma/adenocarcinoma LNCaP,
PC3, and DU145 cell lines as well as human prostate epithelial viral transformed PZ-HPV-7 (PZ) and RWPE-1 cell
lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
Normal prostate epithelial PrEC cells were purchased from
Lonza. All cell lines were cultured and maintained in the
media recommended in the manufacturer's protocols.
Plasmid-cloned Keap1 cDNA and Bcl-xL cDNA (OriGene)
and siRNAs for knocking down Keap1, Nrf2, thioredoxin
(TrX), PGAM5, and Bcl-xL (Dharmacon) were transfected
into cultured cells before treatment. Parthenolide and
its water-soluble prodrug, dimethylamino-parthenolide
(DMAPT), were synthesized as previously described (31).
The cells were treated with 0 to 5 mmol/L parthenolide
followed by irradiation by a 250 kV X-ray machine (Faxitron
X-ray Corp.) with peak energy of 130 kV, 0.05 mm Al ﬁlter, at
a dose of 0 to 6 Gy. Cell survival rates were quantiﬁed by
colony survival fraction, Trypan blue exclusion assay, and
MTT assay, as previously described (25, 32).

Animals
Four- to ﬁve-week-old male NCRNU (nu/nu athymic nude)
mice were obtained from Taconic (Hudson). For formation of
xenograft tumors, 1.8  106 cells mixed in Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were subcutaneously injected into the right ﬂank
of the mice. Tumor volumes were routinely measured and their
sizes calculated on the basis of a protocol described elsewhere
(33). Animals with an average tumor size of 500 mm3 were
randomized into several groups for DMAPT and radiation
treatments. The tumors were treated 5 times with 10 mg/kg
DMAPT and 3 Gy IR. The tumor tissues were collected, and 100
mg of tissue was lysed to quantify amounts of oxidized or
reduced Keap1 and levels of downstream proteins. To determine the protective effect of parthenolide against radiation
damage, mice were pretreated with DMAPT followed by radiation treatment (5  3Gy). Prostate and bladder tissues were
ﬁxed, embedded, and processed for routine electron microscopy. The embedded blocks were sectioned and transferred to
copper grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate, followed
by lead citrate. Grids were observed in an electron microscope
(Hitachi H-600) operated at 75 kV. Mitochondrial damage was
quantiﬁed by a pathologist (T.D. Oberley) using identiﬁed
ultrastructural changes including swelling, vacuolization,
myelination, disorganization, and loss of cristae, lysosomal
degradation, and membrane disruption. Animal experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky (Lexington,
KY), Approval Protocol No. 01077M2006.
Quantiﬁcation of intracellular superoxide and
prooxidant
Dihydroethidium (DHE, Invitrogen), which exhibits blue ﬂuorescence in the cytosol until oxidized, was used to estimate the
levels of superoxide after parthenolide treatment. To conﬁrm the
level of superoxide induced by parthenolide, the cells were pretreated with 50 mg PEG-SOD (Sigma) for 1 hour followed by
parthenolide treatment. Antimycin (Sigma) was used as a positive control because it has been shown to increase superoxide in
all tested cell lines. A dichloroﬂuorescein (DCF) assay was used
to quantify the levels of intracellular ROS after parthenolide
treatment. The cells were labeled by both carboxy-H2DCFDA
(sensitive to oxidation, Invitrogen) and carboxy-DCFDA (insensitive to oxidation, Invitrogen). The H2DCFDA:DCFDA ratio was
used to optimize the controls of cell number, dry uptake, and
ester cleavage. The procedures for both DHE and DCF were
conducted by the University of Kentucky Flow Cytometer Facility
using a FACScan protocol provided by Dr. Douglas R. Spitz
(Professor of Radiation Oncology at the University of Iowa; 34).
Measurement of oxygen consumption rates
To determine how parthenolide changes mitochondrial
function in cancer and normal cells, a Seahorse Bioscience
XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer was used to measure oxygen
consumption rates (OCR) after parthenolide treatment. The
XF24 creates a transient, 7 mL chamber in specialized microplates, which allows determination of oxygen and proton
concentrations in real time. To allow comparison between
experiments, data are expressed as the OCR in pmoL/min or

the rate of extracellular acidiﬁcation in mpH/min. Reserve
capacity, an important index that indicates capacity of mitochondrial respiration, is calculated by subtracting baseline
OCR from maximal OCR.
Detection of oxidized and reduced forms of Keap1
protein
3-N-maleimido-propionyl biocytin was used to selectively
label sulfhydryl (SH) and then was detected by biotin–streptavidin integration on the blots, as previously described (35).
To quantify disulﬁde (S-S) bonds, the SH form was stabilized by
treating with N-ethylmaleimide and then the S-S bonds were
reduced by treating with 2-mercaptoethanol. To identify SH
and S-S moieties of Keap1 protein, the labeled proteins were
immunoprecipitated by Keap1 antibody (Abcam) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by detection with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma).
Immunoblots and immunoprecipitation
Homogenized cells and tumor tissues were electrophoresed
on an 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies against Keap1 (Abcam), Nrf2 (Abcam), MnSOD (Upstate
Biotech), CuZnSOD (eBiosci), Gpx (Abcam), catalase (Millipore), TrX (BD Sciences), PGAM5 (Santa Cruz Biotech.), Bcl-xL
(Santa Cruz Biotech.), LC3B (Cell Signaling), b-actin (Sigma),
and pCNA (Santa Cruz Biotech.). All secondary antibodies were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. Immunoblots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). For immunoprecipitation,
cell extracts were incubated overnight with one primary antibody at 4 C and integrated with a protein A/G agarose (Santa
Cruz Biotech). Immunocomplexes were precipitated and fractionated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Interacting proteins were
detected by immunoblotting with their primary antibodies.
SOD enzymatic assay
MnSOD activities were measured by the nitroblue tetrazolium-bathocuproin sulfonate reduction inhibition method.
Sodium cyanide (2 mmol/L) was used to inhibit CuZnSOD
activity (36).
Statistical data analyses
Multiple independent experiments were conducted for each
set of data presented. Images in Immunoblots were quantiﬁed
using Carestream Molecular Imaging software (Carestream
Health Inc.). Statistical signiﬁcance was analyzed using oneway ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison test, followed by
data analysis with GraphPad Prism.

Results
Parthenolide enhances radiosensitivity of prostate
tumors but protects normal tissues from radiation
Our previous studies showed that parthenolide is able to
selectively enhance the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells
without injury to normal prostate epithelial cells (24, 25). To
determine whether parthenolide enhances radiotherapy in
vivo, human prostate cancer PC3 cells were subcutaneously

implanted into the right ﬂank of nude male mice. When tumor
size reached a volume of 500 mm3, animals were randomized
into groups according to the treatment consisting of saline or
10 mg/kg DMAPT. One hour after saline or DMAPT was
administered, the tumors were treated with fractionated radiation of 1 Gy or 2 Gy per day for 5 days followed by routine
measurement of tumor volume. The tumor growth curves are
shown in Fig. 1A. Mice were humanely killed when a tumor
reached the maximum size of 2,000 mm3. Tumor growth was
clearly delayed in the treatment groups, particularly when the
drug and radiation were combined, compared with growth in
the untreated group. The tumor growth rates after treatment
were compared according to the days needed for tumor
volume to reach 2,000 mm3. DMAPT signiﬁcantly enhanced
radiotherapeutic efﬁciency compared with the effects of radiation treatment alone (Fig. 1B). A separate group of nude male
mice that had no cancer cell implantation was treated with
DMAPT and radiation to determine the toxicity of DMAPT to
organs that can be affected by radiotherapy of prostate cancer.
Prostates and bladders of the animals were examined by light
and electron microscopy. At 60 days after irradiation, no gross
pathology was observed (data not shown). However, ultrastructural damage was clearly observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 1C). Mitochondrial damage was most pronounced
and this was morphometrically analyzed. The number of
damaged mitochondria in prostate and bladder was proportional to radiation exposure. Pretreatment with DMAPT signiﬁcantly reduced the number of damaged mitochondria in
both organs compared with the group without DMAPT treatment (Fig. 1C and D). These results indicate that DMAPT, the
water-soluble prodrug of parthenolide, is a promising agent for
selectively enhancing the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to
radiation while protecting normal tissues from damage caused
by radiation.
Parthenolide differentially modulates cellular ROS levels
in cancer and normal cells
To determine the effect of parthenolide on redox homeostasis in cancer and normal cells, the levels of superoxide and
total ROS after parthenolide treatment were measured using
ﬂow cytometry. The mean ﬂuorescence intensity of DHE and
the H2DCFDA:DCFDA ratio were higher in prostate cancer PC3
cells than in normal prostate PZ and PrEC cells, indicating
higher basal levels of superoxide and total ROS, respectively
(Fig. 2A and B). Following parthenolide treatment, DHE and
DCF levels increased further in PC3 cells but declined slightly in
both types of noncancerous cells. Combining PEG-SOD with
parthenolide treatment restored the basal level of DHE ﬂuorescence. As positive controls, addition of equivalent concentrations of the ROS-stimulating agents antimycin (Fig. 2A) and
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Fig. 2B) caused high
levels of ROS in all the tested cell lines.
The levels of antioxidant proteins were also quantiﬁed
(Fig. 2C). Parthenolide altered the protein level of the antioxidant enzymes, in particular mitochondria-localized antioxidant enzymes. MnSOD and glutathione peroxidase (GpX)
were signiﬁcantly reduced in all 3 parthenolide-treated prostate cancer cell lines. Intriguingly, parthenolide had the

opposite effect in the 3 normal prostate cell lines. However,
neither cancer nor normal cells showed any obvious changes
after parthenolide treatment for the major cytosolic superoxide removal protein, copper, and zinc-containing SOD (CuZnSOD). This observation was conﬁrmed by quantiﬁcation of the
corresponding enzyme activity (Fig. 2D). These results suggest
that parthenolide-mediated alteration of cellular redox status
is mediated, at least in part, by changing the activities of
antioxidant enzymes in mitochondria.
To probe whether altering cellular redox status is associated
with a change in mitochondrial respiration, the OCR in the
parthenolide-treated cells was measured using a Seahorse
Bioscience FX OxygenFlux Analyzer. The basal and maximal
OCR in normal cells was higher than in cancer cells (Fig. 2E).
Importantly, parthenolide was able to increase the OCR and
reserve capacity in PZ cells, whereas parthenolide had no effect
on PC3 OCR. Finally, the cytotoxicity of parthenolide was

tested in all the cell lines using an MTT assay, which requires
active mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 2F, parthenolide was
toxic to all the cancer cells but not to the normal cell lines.
Taken together, these results suggest that changes in cellular
redox status and mitochondrial function may be a cause for the
differential biologic effects of parthenolide on cancer and
normal cells.
Keap1 is susceptible to parthenolide-mediated redox
modiﬁcation
Keap1, a redox-sensitive protein, has been reported to play
an important role in cell survival under oxidative stress (29). To
investigate whether parthenolide modiﬁes Keap1 function, a
Keap1 antibody linked to biotin was used to immunoprecipitate redox-modiﬁed Keap1 protein and the presence of oxidized (-S-S-) and reduced (-SH) cysteine residues was detected
using a secondary antibody linked to streptavidin. In the 3

homogenized and incubated with MPB. Reduced (SH-) and oxidized (S-S) forms of Keap1 in the tissues were detected. D, tumor tissues were homogenized

but increased the reduced form of Keap1 in the tumors (Fig.
3C). Changes in antioxidant proteins in mouse xenograft tumor
tissues treated with DMAPT are also consistent with the result
obtained from in vitro studies (Fig. 3D), indicating that parthenolide decreases the level of mitochondrial antioxidant proteins in prostate tumors.
Oxidization of Keap1 leads to activation of the Nrf2
prosurvival pathway in normal cells
Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway through dissociation with Keap1 resulting in Nrf2 nuclear translocation is
considered to be a primary prosurvival pathway in response
to oxidative stress (30, 37). To examine whether parthenolide
changes Nrf2 nuclear translocation, the levels of Nrf2 in nuclei
were measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, the nuclear levels of Nrf2
were increased in the 3 normal cell lines treated with parthenolide, but no changes were observed in the 3 cancer cell lines.
To examine whether activation of the Nrf2 pathway is a major
mechanism by which parthenolide protects normal cells
against radiation injury, Keap1 and Nrf2 were silenced in PZ
cells by transfecting their siRNA (Fig. 4B, left). Cell survival
decreased when Nrf2 was silent. IR signiﬁcantly reduced cell
survival but the cell survival was restored when Keap1 was
silenced (Fig. 4B, right panel). These results suggest that

oxidation of Keap1 and subsequent activation of Nrf2 by
parthenolide is essential for normal cell survival after radiation
treatment.
Thioredoxin is necessary for parthenolide-mediated
reduction of Keap1 in cancer cells
TrX is highly expressed in cancer cells and stimulates cell
growth. We previously reported that parthenolide decreases
the reduced form of TrX but increases the oxidized form of TrX
in prostate cancer cells (25). In the present study, we verify that
TrX was expressed at a high level in all 3 cancer cell lines,
whereas a low level was observed in the 3 noncancer cell lines
(Fig. 5A). Immunoprecipitation of Keap1 protein from PC3 cell
extracts using a TrX antibody suggests an interaction between
Keap1 and TrX that is increased by parthenolide (Fig. 5B). To
detect whether the parthenolide-inﬂuenced reduction of
Keap1 in cancer cells is dependent on TrX, we selectively
silenced TrX by transfecting its siRNA before parthenolide
treatment (Fig. 5C, left). As expected, the reduced form of
Keap1 was decreased, but the oxidized form of Keap1 was
increased when TrX was silent (Fig. 5C, middle and right). The
results suggest that TrX is interacting with Keap1 to keep
Keap1 in a reduced state in parthenolide-treated cells. To
further conﬁrm that the function of Keap1 leads to cell death

in parthenolide-treated cancer cells, a Keap1 expression construct was transfected into PC3 cells, followed by parthenolide
and IR treatments. Overexpression of Keap1 resulted in
increases in cell death in both treated and untreated cells (Fig.
5D, top). The levels of mitochondrial phosphoglycerate mutase
5 (PGAM5), a protein serine/threonine phosphatase that interacts with Bcl-xL in the mitochondrial membrane (38), and BclxLwere clearly decreased in the Keap1-transfected cells, but no
changes were observed in Nrf2, Ikka, and IkBa (Fig. 5D,
bottom). These results suggest that the parthenolide-increased
reduced form of Keap1 facilitates Keap1-mediated ubiquitin/
proteasome-dependent degradation of PGAM5 and Bcl-xL,
which is an established mechanism for parthenolide-mediated
cell death in cancer cells.
Keap1 triggers PGAM5-mediated Bcl-xL ubiquitin
degradation in parthenolide-treated cancer cells
To further investigate the mechanism by which parthenolide
enhances the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells, we
determined the interactions between Keap1, PGAM5, and
Bcl-xL. The results show that a reduced form of Keap1, which
is increased in parthenolide-treated PC3 cells, enhanced interaction between Keap1 and PGAM5, as detected by immunoprecipitation using a PGAM5 antibody (Fig. 6A). Bcl-xL, a
prosurvival mitochondrial protein, was also increased in the
pulled down complex (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the proteins that
are associated with Keap1 were decreased in whole-cell
extracts (Fig. 6B). A time course of parthenolide treatment
shows that PGAM5 and Bcl-xL proteins were slightly increased
at 12 hours but decreased at 24 and 48 hours after treatment
(Fig. 6C). Proteins in different cellular fractions were also
quantiﬁed (Fig. 6D). The mitochondria-associated proteins
PGAM5 and Bcl-xL were reduced by the parthenolide treatment, but no change was observed in Hsp75, a control for
mitochondrial protein. Parthenolide had no major effect on the

4412

levels of Nrf2 and Ikka in treated cells. These results suggest
that parthenolide enhances Keap1-mediated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of PGAM5 and Bcl-xL (39).
In addition, parthenolide increased the level of mitochondriaassociated autophagic protein LC3B, suggesting that parthenolide may enhance the radiation sensitivity of prostate cancer
cells partially through triggering the autophagy pathway.
Because Keap1 interacts with PGAM5/Bcl-xL/Nrf2, we
decided to determine the effect of PGAM5/Bcl-xL/Nrf2 in
mediating parthenolide's effect on cancer cells. PGAM5, BclxL, and Nrf2 were silenced using their siRNAs, followed by
parthenolide treatment (Fig. 6E, bottom). The cell survival
fraction was decreased when PGAM5 or Bcl-xL was silent,
which is similar to the effect of parthenolide (Fig. 6E, top). No
signiﬁcant additive effects were observed when parthenolide
was combined with PGAM5 or Bcl-xL siRNA. In contrast, a
signiﬁcant effect was observed when Nrf2 was silent. These
results suggest that Keap1-mediated PGAM5/Bcl-xL degradation, but not Nrf2 degradation, is important for parthenolideinduced cancer cell death.
To further determine whether the function of Bcl-xL plays a
major role in protecting cancer cells against parthenolideinduced cell death, a plasmid carrying Bcl-xL cDNA was
transfected into PC3 cells followed by parthenolide treatment
(Fig. 6F, bottom). The results show that expression of Bcl-xL
efﬁciently protects cells from cytotoxicity caused by parthenolide (Fig. 6F, top). Taken together, these results suggest that
parthenolide enhances the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer
cells, in part, by triggering ubiquitin/proteasome-based degradation of Bcl-xL.
In summary, parthenolide provides radiosensitization in
prostate cancer cells but radioprotection in normal cells, and
the observed differential effects are mediated, in part, by redox
modiﬁcation of Keap1, i.e., reducing Keap1 in cancer cells
but oxidizing Keap1 in normal cells. The distinct redox

Figure 5. TrX-dependent Keap1 reduction by parthenolide in prostate cancer cells. A, the levels of TrX in normal and cancer cells before and after treatment
with parthenolide (PN) were detected by Western blots. B, after the indicated treatment, Keap1 was immunoprecipitated using a TrX antibody. C, PC3
cells were transfected with TrX siRNA before the indicated treatment (top). SH- and S-S bands in Keap1 protein were detected as described in Fig. 3 (bottom).
D, a Keap1 cDNA construct was transfected into PC3 cells. The levels of related proteins were detected by Western blots (bottom). The effect of Keap1 on
radiosensitivity was analyzed using a Trypan blue exclusion assay (top).

modiﬁcation of Keap1 initiates different signaling pathways
that affect mitochondrial function, leading to cell survival or
cell injury in response to radiation, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Discussion
The majority of anticancer therapies fail because cancers
develop phenotypes that are treatment resistant and because
treatments cause unwanted and/or detrimental side effects to
normal cells or to untargeted tissues. While conventional
adjuvant therapies improve tumor response to radiotherapy,
they generally cause additional damage to normal tissues.
Thus, the focus of the present study is to identify adjuvant
therapeutics that can reduce the side effects of radiotherapy.
Our study provides a proof-of-concept for improving the
efﬁcacy of radiotherapy while protecting against injury to

www.aacrjournals.org

normal tissues. It has been shown that parthenolide, the
anti-inﬂammatory phytochemical, is able to suppress tumor
growth in many organs (22–25). In addition, parthenolide
seems to synergically enhance chemotherapeutic efﬁciency
when it is combined with taxol or cisplatin to treat lung and
gastric cancer cells (23, 40). Parthenolide also sensitizes radioresistant osteosarcoma cells to radiotherapy (41). Here, we
show that DMAPT, a parthenolide prodrug, sensitized prostate
cancer cells to radiotherapy in vivo and protected normal
prostate and bladder against radiation-induced tissue injury.
These results extend our previous survival studies in prostate
cancer cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells.
ROS, as products of cell metabolism, play a dual role in
tumorigenesis and tumor suppression. The "two-faced" character of ROS has emerged as a potential source for discovering
anticancer drugs. Redox homeostasis is frequently deregulated

in cancers, as it is constantly exposed to high levels of ROS
compared with normal counterparts. Our data show that
constitutively elevated levels of oxidative stress in cancer cells
represent a speciﬁc vulnerability that can be selectively targeted by direct- or indirect-acting prooxidants and antioxidants or redox modulators. Theoretically, the differential redox
status of cancer cells compared with normal cells should
provide a therapeutic window for selective redox intervention
via additional increases in ROS. In this context, normal and
cancer cells should respond differently to the same level of
prooxidant action generated either by direct production of
oxidative species or by modulation of speciﬁc cellular targets
involved in redox regulation. In this study, we show that
parthenolide serves as a prooxidant and displays a selective
redox modiﬁcation capability that differentially modulates
cellular redox signals and targets. The Michael acceptor reacts
with a thiol group of target proteins through covalent adduc-

tion (21). Parthenolide contains electrophilic a-methyleneg-lactone, a bisfunctional Michael acceptor, and displays a
potential for bifunctional target alkylation and crosslinking.
The present study shows the inverse effects of parthenolide on
redox modiﬁcation in cancer cells compared with normal cells.
Remarkably, observations of the cytotoxic and cytoprotective
effects of parthenolide are consistent with its action in the
modulation of ROS levels in both cancer and normal cells.
Alteration of cellular ROS by parthenolide is attributed to
functionally up- or downregulating antioxidant enzymes in
mitochondria, which consequently regulates mitochondrial
respiration. Parthenolide is able to selectively reduce the
activity of several enzymes involved in oxidative stress removal
in cancer cells, which in turn can cause ROS levels to rise above
the threshold for cell death. This ﬁnding predicts that antioxidant proteins and mitochondria are feasible therapeutic
targets.

It has been reported that parthenolide is a potent inhibitor of
NF-kB, which is a ROS-responsive transcriptional factor
involved in both tumor progression and tumor resistance to
treatment through upregulation of antiapoptotic genes, such
as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, and XIAP (42). We previously showed
that NADPH oxidase-mediated inactivation of the Foxo 3
signaling pathway is involved in the parthenolide-enhanced
radiosensitivity of prostate cancer (25). However, previous
studies did not explain how parthenolide exerts such an
opposing effect in tumor and normal cells. The present study
identiﬁes Keap1 as a redox signaling sensor that plays a pivotal
role in the differential regulation of the downstream signaling
targets in response to radiation-mediated cytotoxicity in prostate cancer and normal cells. Keap1, an adaptor protein for
ubiquitin-based processing by the CUL3/RBX1-dependent E3
ubiquitin ligase complex, functions as a sensor for thiol-reactive redox modiﬁcation (43). The present study shows that
stabilization of Nrf2 by oxidation of Keap1 serves as a major
mechanism by which parthenolide protects normal tissues
against radiotoxicity through upregulation of antioxidant
enzymes in mitochondria. However, Nrf2 transcriptional activation did not play a major role in parthenolide-treated
prostate cancer cells. Thus, it is interesting to note that unlike
traditional chemotherapeutic agents, parthenolide is unable to
enhance resistance of prostate cancer to radiation treatment
by stimulating Nrf2 target genes.
In addition to regulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, Keap1
is able to bind other proteins such as p62 and PGAM5 (44).
Interaction between Keap1 and p62 facilitates release of Nrf2
from the complex, which is considered to be a noncanonical
cysteine-independent mechanism for the autophagy deﬁcien-

www.aacrjournals.org

cy–activated Nrf2 pathway (45). The N-terminus of PGAM5
interacts with the Kelch domain of Keap1 and its C-terminus
binds to Bcl-xL. Keap1-dependent ubiquitination results in
proteasome-dependent degradation of PGAM5 and Bcl-xL
(38). Bcl-xL, an important member of the Bcl-2 family, is a
potent antiapoptotic factor that plays a crucial role in cell
survival by maintaining the electrochemical and osmotic
homeostasis of mitochondria (46). The present study shows
that parthenolide increases the level of reduced Keap1 and
consequently induces Keap1-dependent degradation of
PGAM5 and Bcl-xL in cancer cells, suggesting that formation
of the Keap1-PGAM5-Bcl-xL complex is a mechanism underlying the effect of parthenolide on radiosensitization of prostate cancer cells.
Although a high rate of aerobic glycolysis in tumors, known
as the Warburg effect, has been observed in various types of
cancer, cancers have functional mitochondria, and mitochondrial respiration is necessary for cancer cell proliferation (47).
Cancer cells depend on a hyperactive metabolism to fuel their
rapid growth and also on antioxidative enzymes to quench
potentially toxic ROS generated by such a high metabolic
demand (48). Our results show that parthenolide not only
suppresses MnSOD and GpX, 2 major antioxidant enzymes in
mitochondria, but also activates Bcl-xL degradation in cancer
cells, which suggests that mitochondria are a feasible target for
anticancer treatment. The present study also shows that
parthenolide may maintain normal cell survival through induction of MnSOD and GpX activity. Thus, a more efﬁcient and safe
therapy may involve modiﬁcation of cellular redox signaling by
alteration of the antioxidant response coupled to selective
degradation of prosurvival members of the Bcl2 family in

cell growth arrest or cell death by raising cellular ROS, which
oxidizes and damages DNA, proteins, and lipids. Optimizing
