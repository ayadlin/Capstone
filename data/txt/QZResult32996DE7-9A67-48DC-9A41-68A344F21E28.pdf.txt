Abstract
Signals mediated by CXCL12 (SDF1) and its receptor CXCR4 are centrally involved in cancer progression, both
directly by activating cancer cells and indirectly by inducing angiogenesis plus recruiting T regulatory and plasmacytoid dendritic immune cells. Here, we show that in ascites isolated from ovarian cancer patients, both CXCL12 and
CXCR4 are controlled by the tumor-associated inﬂammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which attracts
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) into the ascites microenvironment. In this setting, PGE2 was essential both
for expression of functional CXCR4 in cancer-associated MDSCs and for production of its ligand CXCL12. Frequencies
of CD11bþCD14þCD33þCXCR4þ MDSCs closely correlated with CXCL12 and PGE2 levels in patient ascites. MDSCs
migrated toward ovarian cancer ascites in a CXCR4-dependent manner that required COX2 activity and autocrine
PGE2 production. Inhibition of COX2 or the PGE2 receptors EP2/EP4 in MDSCs suppressed expression of CXCR4 and
MDSC responsiveness to CXCL12 or ovarian cancer ascites. Similarly, COX2 inhibition also blocked CXCL12
production in the ovarian cancer environment and its ability to attract MDSCs. Together, our ﬁndings elucidate
a central role for PGE2 in MDSC accumulation triggered by the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway, providing a powerful
rationale to target PGE2 signaling in ovarian cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7463–70. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, now designated as
CXCL12) is overproduced by stromal and tumor cells in
different tumor microenvironments (1–4). CXCL12 exerts
multiple tumor-promoting functions, either directly
through its cognate receptor CXCR4 present on cancer
cells enhancing tumor growth, migration, and invasiveness,
or indirectly by recruiting endothelial progenitors, needed
for tumor angiogenesis (3, 5, 6). Moreover, regulatory T
cells (Treg) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which
play a crucial role in immune evasion, are attracted to the
tumor environment through CXCL12 (6–8). By recruiting
and retaining these immunosuppressive cells, the tumor

microenvironment limits the effectiveness of immune
responses (9).
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC; ref. 10, 11) have
emerged as critical elements of cancer-induced immune dysfunction. MDSCs carry out their suppressive functions at the
site of tumor growth (10) and represent a heterogeneous
population of immature myeloid cells involving immature
precursors of macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells
(DC), capable of suppressing immune response in vitro and in
vivo (12). MDSCs residing within the tumor environment are
deﬁcient in costimulatory-molecule expression, and inefﬁcient
in lymphoid homing (13). Instead, they abrogate adaptive
immune responses to cancer cells, as shown in experimental
animal models and human cancer patients (14).
High activity of the ovarian cancer microenvironment to
attract other types of suppressive cells (6–8) suggests that, in
addition to accelerated development of MDSCs in cancer
setting, the predominance of MDSCs in ovarian cancer microenvironment may result from their enhanced attraction and/or
retention. Although the molecular mechanisms that regulate
the development and function of MDSCs in the cancer setting
have been extensively studied, particularly in the mouse system
(13, 15–21), the mechanisms guiding MDSCs to human cancer
environments remain poorly understood.
Guided by prior mouse studies showing the involvement of
PGE2 in the regulation of CXCL12 production in cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (22), and the ability of PGE2-producing
tumor cells to enhance CXCR4 expression on differentiating
mouse MDSCs (23, 24), we tested the relevance of PGE2 in the

regulation of the CXCR4-CXCL12 interplay in human ovarian
cancer–inﬁltrating MDSCs. Our data show that the CXCR4CXCL12 axis is the key pathway mediating the attraction of
monocytic MDSC into the tumor environment of ovarian
cancer patients, with PGE2 responsible for the induction of
both functional CXCR4 and CXCL12. The ability of COX2
inhibitors and PGE2 receptor blockers to reverse the chemokine responsiveness of fully developed MDSCs and to decrease
the levels of CXCL12 produced in the ovarian cancer environment provides a new tool to counteract immune suppression
in therapeutic regimens aimed at restoring immune surveillance in cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Human ovarian cancer ascites and sera were obtained from
previously untreated patients with advanced epithelial ovarian
cancer in stage III or IV, after obtaining written informed
consent. The nature and possible consequences of the studies
were explained. All specimens were provided under the protocols approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional
Review Board (IRB0406147) or the Roswell Park Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board (CIC02–15). Patients underwent a primary surgical debulking procedure for clinical
staging. Fresh ascites were obtained intraoperatively, and
blood draws were done either immediately preoperatively or
at the ﬁrst postoperative visit prior to any adjuvant therapy.
Isolation of ovarian cancer ascites-inﬁltrating cells and
MDSCs
Human ovarian cancer ascites were collected aseptically and
inﬁltrating primary cells harvested by centrifugation. CD11bþ
MDSCs were obtained after centrifugation of ascites, followed
by RBC lysis and positive magnetic selection of CD11bþ cells
(CD11b EasySep Isolation kit; Stem Cell Tech). The isolated
cells were CD11bþ >95% pure. Control CD11bþ cells were
isolated from healthy donor buffy coats, using the same
method.
Flow cytometry
Two- and 3-color cell surface and intracellular immunostaining analysis was done using Beckman Coulter Epics XL or
Accuri ﬂow-cytometer. Ovarian cancer–isolated cells were
stained with the following antibodies CCR2-PE, CCR5-PE,
CCR6-PE, CXCR1-PE, CXCR4-PE, CD11b-FITC, CD14-PE,
CD33-APC, CD34-PE/Cy7 (BD and eBioscience). Rat IgG2aPE, IgG1-FITC, IgG1-APC, and IgG1-PE/Cy7 isotype controls,
and rat IgG2a-FITC isotype control were from BD PharMingen.
Chemotaxis assay
Chemotaxis assays were done as previously described (25).
rhu-CXCL-12a (5–50 ng/mL; R&D) in IMDMþ0.5% FBS or
ovarian cancer ascites were used as chemotaxis media. When
indicated, cells were pretreated for 10 minutes with CXCR4
antagonist AMD3100 (1,000 ng/mL; Sigma) and CCR5 antagonist vicriviroc (1,000 ng/mL) before chemotaxis experiments
to block the CXCR4 and CCR5-dependent chemotaxis. For

desensitization, CXCL12 or CCL5 were added to the cells in the
upper chamber 10 minutes before the chemotaxis experiment.
The concentrations of the blocking agents used did not have
any signiﬁcant impact on the viability of cultured cells, as
determined by the live cell counts.
Isolation of peripheral blood naive CD8þ T-cell
populations and CD3/CD28 in vitro effector generation
Naive CD8þCD45RAþCD45RO T cells were isolated from
PBMCs by negative selection using the naive CD8þ T-cell
enrichment cocktail (Stem Cell Tech), resulting in a uniform
population of CD8þCD45RAþCD45ROcells. CD8þ T cells
were stimulated with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (5 mL/mL; Invitrogen Dynal AS) in the presence or absence of ovarian cancer
ascites-isolated MDSCs. CFSE staining of CD8þ T cells (Invitrogen) was done according to the manufacturer's instructions.
On day 4 and 5, expanded CD8þ T cells were analyzed for the
expression of granzyme B expression and proliferation.
ELISA
Ovarian cancer ascites were collected into collection tubes,
centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatants
were immediately stored at 80 C until use. Ovarian cancer
ascites were used immediately after defrosting and were not
subjected to further freeze-thaw cycles. Ovarian cancer ascites
and conditioned media generated by culturing ovarian cancer
ascites-inﬁltrating primary cells for 48 hours were analyzed for
CXCL12/SDF-1 and CCL5 by indirect sandwich ELISA (R&D)
and PGE2 by competitive parameter immunoassay according
to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D).
Taqman analysis of mRNA expression
mRNA levels of CD11b, IL-10, IDO1, ARG1, NOS2, COX2,
CXCR4, CXCL12/SDF-1 were analyzed in ovarian cancer–ascites inﬁltrating primary cells versus patient's matched PBMCs
and ovarian cancer ascites-isolated CD11bþ cells versus control CD11bþ cells (isolated from normal blood), either after
their isolation or after the overnight incubation in the presence
or absence of the COX2 inhibitor Celecoxib (20 mmol/L), EP2
antagonist AH6809, EP4 antagonist AH23848, and EP3 antagonist L798106. The concentrations used did not have any
signiﬁcant impact on the viability of cultured cells, as determined by the live cell counts. Taqman analysis was done as
previously described (25) on the StepOne Plus System (Applied
Biosystems). The expression of each gene was normalized to
HPRT1 and expressed as fold increase (2DCT), where DCT ¼
CT (Target gene)  CT (HPRT1).
Statistical analysis
All data were evaluated using GraphPad Prism 5 software
and analyzed using Student t test (2 tailed), with P < 0.05
considered as signiﬁcant (P < 0.05 marked  ; P < 0.01 marked  ;
P < 0.001 marked  ). A linear correlation between 2 continuous variables was tested with the R2 coefﬁcient of determination. When indicated, the data from multiple different
patients and control donors are expressed as means and SD
from N donors (see the N values in the ﬁgure legends). The data
from representative experiments was obtained from triplicate

Results
High expression of CXCR4 on cancer-isolated monocytic
MDSCs mediates their attraction to CXCL12-producing
ovarian cancer–inﬁltrating cells
CXCR4 is overexpressed on tumor-inﬁltrating suppressive
pDCs (7), with high local levels of its ligand CXCL12 predicting
reduced survival of ovarian cancer patients (26). To address
the relative role of CXCL12 in MDSC accumulation, we
analyzed the expression of chemokine receptors on cancerinﬁltrating MDSCs and their migratory responsiveness. Bulk
tumor ascites contained high numbers of CD11bþ cells, mostly
composed of monocytic MDSCs, as determined by their
uniform expression of CD33 and CD34 (Refs. 10, 14; Fig. 1A).
Such CD11bþCD33þCD34þ MDSCs lacked expression of the
costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD83, with most cells
expressing CD14, typical of the monocytic subset of MDSCs
(Refs. 10, 14, 18; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). These cells
expressed high levels of typical MDSC-associated suppressive

factors (10, 14, 18), including arginase-1, IL-10, IDO1, IL-4Ra
(CD124) and COX2 (Fig. 1B), and strongly suppressed CTL
development (Fig. 1C). Such ascites-associated CD11bþ monocytic MDSCs showed uniformly high expression of CXCR4 (Fig.
1D and E), when compared with blood-isolated monocytic cells
(Fig. 1E, bottom), in addition to lower levels of expression of
CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR1.
In addition to the high expression of CXCR4 on isolated
monocytic MDSCs (Fig. 1D and E), we observed that the
numbers of MDSCs strongly correlated with the levels of
CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12/SDF-1, in the tumor environment
(Fig. 2A). The local gene expression of CXCL12 and secretion
of CXCL12 protein was profoundly higher compared with levels
in patient's blood (Fig. 2B). In contrast, CCL5/Rantes was
expressed at signiﬁcantly lower levels (Fig. 2C), and did not
correlate with the tumor inﬁltration of MDSCs (data not
shown). Moreover, migration of tumor-isolated MDSCs could
be effectively suppressed by CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 or
by CXCL12 desensitization, but not with CCR5 antagonist
vicriviroc or CCL5 desensitization (Fig. 2D). In accordance
with these data, tumor-isolated MDSCs showed strong responsiveness to recombinant CXCL12 (Fig. 2E).

Positive feedback between COX2 and PGE2 is responsible
for both CXCR4 expression on monocytic MDSCs and the
production of CXCL12 in ovarian cancer
Guided by the reported ability of PGE2, a factor implicated in
CXCR4 induction in murine cells (23, 24), and the production of
CXCL12 in mouse tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts (22), we tested
the potential role of PGE2 in the regulation of CXCL12 production and MDSC accumulation in ovarian cancer patients. We
observed a strong correlation between the expression of CD11b
and COX2 expression (Fig. 3A) and between CXCL12 concentrations and the local production of PGE2 (Fig. 3B). In accordance
with the potential causative role of PGE2 in the ovarian cancerassociated CXCL12 production, the expression and secretion of
CXCL12 in ovarian cancer ascites cells was inhibited by COX2
blockade (Fig. 4A and B), closely reﬂecting the degree of inhibition of COX2 expression and PGE2 release (Fig. 4A and B).
In accordance with the driving role of PGE2 in the CXCL12mediated attraction of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment,

ovarian cancer environment was dependent on COX2 activity
and was suppressed following COX2 inhibition during the generation of the ovarian cancer cell-conditioned media (Fig. 4C).
In accordance with the previous report showing that epithelial
cells are the predominant source of CXCL12 in the ovarian
cancer environment (7), the COX2-dependent CXCL12 expression was particularly pronounced in total ascites cells, with only
marginal levels expressed in the CD11bþ fraction (Fig. 4A).
Key role of PGE2–COX2 feedback in the persistence of
CXCR4 expression by ovarian cancer–associated

Interestingly, overnight COX2 inhibition reduced not only
CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression in ovarian cancer ascites cells
(Fig. 4A and D), but also the expression of endogenous COX2 in
ovarian cancer ascites primary cells and ovarian cancer–isolated MDSCs (Fig. 4A), indicating the crucial role of an intact
positive feedback loop between PGE2 and COX2 in the

production of CXCL12 in the ovarian cancer environment. The
expression of CXCR4 on ovarian cancer–isolated MDSCs was
also suppressed by EP2 and EP4 (but not EP3) blockade (Fig.
4D), indicating that the effects of endogenous PGE2 on CXCR4
expression by MDSCs are mediated in part by EP2 and EP4.

Discussion
In this study, we have identiﬁed the critical role of the CXCR4CXCL12/SDF-1 migratory axis in the accumulation of immunosuppressive monocytic MDSCs in tumor microenvironment
of ovarian cancer patients. We have further showed that the
tumor-associated inﬂammatory mediator, PGE2, induces both
CXCL12/SDF-1 chemokine production in the ovarian cancer
environment, and CXCR4 expression on MDSC precursors and
their resulting responsiveness to CXCL12. Moreover, continued

www.aacrjournals.org

PGE2 signaling in fully developed MDSCs isolated from ovarian
cancer patients is critically important for their continued expression of CXCR4 and responsiveness to CXCL12, promoting the
attraction and retention of MDSCs in the tumor environment.
Correlation of ovarian cancer–associated CXCL12 levels
with the local PGE2 production and local inﬁltration of
CD11bþCD14þCD33þ MDSCs substantiate the physiologic
role of PGE2 in controlling monocytic MDSC accumulation in
human cancer. Although the current data show that PGE2 is
responsible for the induction of functional CXCR4 and
CXCL12-mediated attraction of MDSCs, the current results
also implicate that COX2- and PGE2- antagonism may help to
overcome additional CXCL12-dependent mechanism of cancer
progression, that include the direct impact of CXCL12 upon
tumor growth and invasiveness (7, 26) as well as local accumulation of CXCR4-expressing suppressive pDCs and Tregs in
cancer tissues and bone-marrow of cancer patients (7, 27).
In line with the possibility that local PGE2 gradient in the
tumor-surrounding environment allows for the gradual
recruitment of migrating MDSCs or MDSC-precursors via
CXCL12-CXCR4, cancer cell inoculation has been shown to
induce the appearance of VEGFRþCXCR4þCD11bþ cells in the
blood of cancer-bearing mice (24). However, at present, we
cannot exclude the possibility that MDSCs or MDSC-precursors are attracted into tumor microenvironment via alternative
pathway and tumor-produced PGE2 induces CXCR4 expression and MDSC retention in the CXCL12-enriched tumor
environment. Although tumor cells themselves or tumor-associated stromal cells (e.g., ﬁbroblasts (22), mesothelial cells (28),
and vascular endothelial cells (29) may overproduce PGE2
spontaneously (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for the variable
levels of PGE2 production by the non-MDSC component of
ovarian cancer ascites), an alternative possibility is that tumor
cell-derived factors, for example mucins in the initial induction
of the ﬁrst wave of COX2 expression in inﬁltrating monocytic
cells, as proposed in the colorectal cancer system (30).
Ovarian cancer–associated PGE2 promotes the MDSC
expression of COX2 (Fig. 4A), the key enzyme regulating
PGE2 synthesis (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for the consistently high levels of PGE2 production by ovarian cancer–
isolated monocytic MDSCs), thereby creating a positive
feedback loop where PGE2 produced by MDSCs helps to
maintain the CXCL12 responsiveness and local retention of
CXCR4þ MDSCs. Although this last mechanism can contribute to a vicious cycle amplifying the persistence of MDSCs
within cancer settings, the requirement for continued production of PGE2 in the accumulation of MDSCs allows for
new modes of their pharmacologic modulation.
Because high level of CXCL12 in ovarian cancer ascites represents a negative prognostic factor of ovarian cancer patients (26),
and PGE2 also controls the production of CCL22 (25), another
chemokine involved in recruiting CCR4þ Tregs and a negative
prognostic factor in ovarian cancer (4), our current data highlight
the key role of PGE2 in the accumulation of multiple types of
cancer-associated suppressive cells (4, 7, 27) and provide additional rationale for PGE2 targeting in ovarian cancer therapy.
In this last regard, we observed that pharmacologic inhibition of PGE2 production suppresses the production of CXCL12

20 mmol/L). D, relative expression of CXCR4 in ovarian cancer–isolated CD11bþ cells, pretreated or not with Celecoxib, EP4 antagonist AH23848, EP2
antagonist AH6809, and EP3 antagonist L798106. All data (A–D) were reproduced in 3 to 7 independent experiments, using the cells from different donors. The

in ovarian cancer ascites cells (Fig. 4A and B). Moreover, even
short-term exposure of the fully developed ovarian cancer–
isolated MDSCs to COX2 inhibitors (or EP2- and EP4-blockers)
suppresses their expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 4A and D) and
migratory responsiveness to recombinant CXCL12 (Fig. 4C).
Because overproduction of COX2 and PGE2 is a hallmark
of many tumor types (31–33), the presently deﬁned mechanism is likely applicable to the local accumulation of
MDSCs observed in different cancer types (5, 9). and to
additional (MDSC independent) pathways of promoting
tumor growth in different forms of cancer, with similarly
wide therapeutic implications.
Although chemokines play a crucial role in immune and
inﬂammatory reactions, they have an equally important role in
the development of a variety of cancers, being involved in cell
transformation, survival, growth, metastasis, and tumor-associated angiogenesis (34). CXCL12 expressed by the tumorassociated ﬁbroblasts promotes the progression of breast
cancer by directly enhancing tumor growth and by recruiting
endothelial progenitor cells that are required for tumor neoangiogenesis (3). COX2 and PGE2 are also involved in tumor
stroma formation by recruiting stromal ﬁbroblasts via the
CXCL12-CXCR4 axis (22), and mediating the angiogenic effects
of bFGF and VEGF by enhancing CXCR4 expression in microvascular endothelial cells (35), and by inducing proangiogenic
chemokines, CXCL5 (epithelial cell–derived neutrophil activa-

tor 78), CXCL8 (IL-8) and CXCL12 (Refs. 22, 36; and the current
data).
In addition to the currently shown central role of PGE2 in
MDSC accumulation, PGE2 has recently been shown to bias the
chemokine production of DCs, abrogating their CXCL9-,
CXCL10-, CXCL11-, CCL5-, and CCL19-mediated ability to
attract naive, effector, and memory T cells and NK cells
(25, 37, 38). Instead, PGE2 promotes the CCL22-driven interaction of DCs with undesirable Treg cells (25), known to be
preferentially expanded and recruited to cancer tissues (8),
where the levels of CCL22 and Treg inﬁltration have a strong
negative prognostic value (4). The key role of PGE2 in the
induction of CCL22 and CXCL12, the chemokines attracting
MDSCs, Tregs and suppressive pDCs to different tumors
(4, 7, 8, 27), and its ability to suppress the local inﬂux of CTLs,
Th1, and NK cells (25, 37, 38), suggests the possibility of
targeting PGE2 to correct the balance between the effector
and suppressive cells at the tumor sites.
Overall, our current data help to understand the biology of
MDSCs arising in the cancer setting, pointing to the causative
role of a tumor-associated inﬂammatory mediator, PGE2, in
one of the key aspects of monocytic MDSC biology, that is, their
accumulation. They also provide rationale for including inhibitors of PGE2 synthesis and function to counteract the
CXCL12-mediated immune-mediated and nonimmune mechanism of tumor progression in the therapy of cancer patients.
