Abstract
Molecular mimetics of the caspase activator second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) are
being investigated for use in cancer therapy, but an understanding of in vivo effects remains incomplete. In
this study, we offer evidence that SMAC mimetics elicit a proinﬂammatory cell death in cancer cells that
engages an adaptive antitumor immune response. Cancer cells of different histologic origin underwent
apoptosis when transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding a cytosolic form of the SMAC mimetic LVtSMAC. Strikingly, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LV-tSMAC resulted in the induction of apoptosis,
activation of antitumor immunity, and enhanced survival. Antitumor immunity was accompanied by an
increase of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes displaying low PD-1 expression, high lytic capacity, and high levels
of IFN-g when stimulated. We also noted in vivo a decrease in regulatory T cells along with in vitro activation
of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells by dendritic cells (DC) isolated from tumor draining lymph nodes. Last, tumorspeciﬁc cytotoxic T cells were also found to be activated in vivo. Mechanistic analyses showed that
transduction of cancer cells with LV-tSMAC resulted in exposure of calreticulin but not release of HMGB1
or ATP. Nevertheless, DCs were activated upon engulfment of dying cancer cells. Further validation of
these ﬁndings was obtained by their extension in a model of human melanoma using transcriptionally
targeted LV-tSMAC. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that SMAC mimetics can elicit a proinﬂammatory
cell death that is sufﬁcient to activate adaptive antitumor immune responses in cancer. Cancer Res; 72(6);

Introduction
Deregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of many cancers (1).
Several abnormalities have been described, including overexpression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP; refs. 1–3)
and failure of IAP antagonists to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytosol (4). Second mitochondria-derived
activator of caspases (SMAC), also known as direct inhibitor
of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) is an IAP
antagonist that is a potentially interesting therapeutic target.
Cleavage of the mitochondrial targeting signal of SMAC is

required for its translocation to the cytosol, in which SMAC
binds to the baculovirus IAP repeat domain of IAPs (5). As such
SMAC competes with caspase-3 and -9 for binding to IAPs,
resulting in their release, cleavage of their substrates, and
induction of apoptosis. This knowledge has led to the development of small molecules that mimic SMAC functions (6–9)
and to the development of gene vectors encoding full-length
SMAC (10), pro-SMAC (4, 11), or processed SMAC (tSMAC;
ref. 12), illustrating that SMAC plays a pivotal role in the onset
of cancer cell apoptosis.
Dendritic cells (DC) in the tumor environment are mainly
immature (13), as such ideally equipped to engulf and
process dying cells (14). However, tumor-derived factors
keep DCs immature (13), trap them within the tumor (15)
hence impair effective presentation of ingested antigens to T
cells. Moreover, these immature DCs have immune suppressive rather than stimulating properties (16). It has been
suggested that this blockade on antigen-presenting cells
can be overcome by proinﬂammatory signals such as pathogen-derived factors (13). Because we showed that lentiviral
vectors (LV) activate DCs through Toll-like receptors (TLR;
refs. 17, 18), we evaluated whether lentiviral delivery of
tSMAC (LV-tSMAC) to tumor cells induces apoptosis and
boosts antitumor immunity. We report on the antitumor
efﬁcacy of this strategy, together with the immunologic
mechanisms responsible for its outcome.

Lentiviral Delivery of tSMAC to Tumor Cells

Materials and Methods
Mice, cell lines, and tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
Female 6- to 12-week-old C57BL/6, DBA/2, and C3H3 mice
were purchased from Harlan. OT-I mice that carry a transgenic
CD8þ T-cell receptor speciﬁc for the MHC I-restricted ovalbumin (OVA) peptide SIINFEKL were a gift from B. Lambrecht
(University of Ghent). C57BL/6 TLR4 KO mice were a gift from
S. Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine). Animals were handled
according to the Institutional Guidelines. Approval from the
Ethical Committee for use of laboratory animals of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel was obtained.
The mouse melanoma cell lines K1735-C4 (provided by
I.J. Fidler, University of Texas), B16F0 and MO4 (provided
by K. Rock, University of Massachusetts Medical Center), and
HEK293T cells [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)]
were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium
(Lonza), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Harlan),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine (L-Glu; Lonza), 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (PS; Lonza). The mouse mastocytoma cell line P815 (provided by C. Uytttenhove, Universite
Catholique de Louvain), the human colon carcinoma cell
line Caco-2 (ATCC), the human breast carcinoma cell line
MCF7 (ATCC), and the human melanoma cell lines 888-mel
and 1087-mel (provided by S.L. Topalian, Surgery Branch,
National Cancer Institute) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza) supplemented with FBS, L-Glu, and PS. No full
authentication was carried out. Cell lines were tested for their
known characteristics including expression of antigens and
MHC molecules by reverse transcriptase PCR or ﬂow cytometry. Their in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics were closely
monitored.
Tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL L2D8), recognizing
gp100 presented by HLA-A2 (provided by M. Dudley, Surgery
Branch, NIH) were maintained in RPMI-1640 containing
1% human AB serum (PAA Laboratories), PS, L-Glu, and
6,000 IU/mL IL-2 (Chiron).
Production and characterization of LVs
The packaging plasmid pCMVDR8.9 and the VSV.G encoding plasmid pMD.G were a gift from D. Trono (University
of Geneva). The plasmids pHR'-trip-CMV-luc2-Ires-tNGFRSIN, pHR'-trip-CMV-Ires-tNGFR-SIN, pHR'-trip-CMV-IreseGFP-SIN, and pSIN-Thy1.1 were described (18, 19). The
survivin gene was obtained as a BamHI-BclI fragment
from the plasmid pcDNA3.1-survivin (a gift from E.
Conway, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) and cloned
into the BamHI linearized pHR'-trip-CMV-Ires-tNGFRSIN. The human tyrosinase promoter (huTYR) was obtained
from pGL3-huTYR2E/P (a gift from D. Nettelbeck, German
Cancer Research Center; ref. 20) as a ClaI-BglII fragment
and used to replace the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter
in pHR'-trip-CMV-Ires-eGFP-SIN, after restriction digestion with ClaI-BamHI. The sequence encoding tSMAC
was excised from pcDNA3.1-tSMAC (21) using BglII-XbaI
and cloned into the BamHI-SpeI digested pHR'trip-CMV-Ires-tNGFR-SIN or pHR'-trip-huTYR-Ires-eGFPSIN. Enzymes were purchased from Fermentas. The pro-

www.aacrjournals.org

duction and characterization of LVs was described
(18, 22).
Transduction of cells with LVs
In vitro transduction of 105 tumor cells was carried out at
the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI). Where indicated tumor cells were treated with 1 mg/mL dexamethasone (Organon) or 1 mg/mL mitoxantrone (Teva). Palpable
tumors grown at the tailbase from 3  105 tumor cells were
injected with 107 TU LVs. Where indicated mice were
depleted of CD8þ T cells by i.p. injection of 50 mg antiCD8 antibody (clone 2.43.1, prepared in-house) 24 and
2 hours before treatment, or treated with a s.c. injection
of 200 mg ZVAD-fmk (Bachem) or an i.p. injection of 5 U of
apyrase (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 hour before and 24 hours after
treatment.
Western blot
The preparation of cell lysates and protein quantiﬁcation
were described (23). Proteins (mg) were separated on a 15%
SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal
rabbit anti-mouse/human antibodies against panIAP (R&D
Systems), survivin, caspase-3 and -9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling) was
used for detection. An HRP-conjugated b-actin antibody
(Cell Signaling) was used for normalization. Antibody binding was visualized with enhanced chemoluminescence
(Pierce).
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
In vivo bioluminescence imaging was carried out as
described (24).
Preparation of single-cell suspension
Single-cell suspensions were prepared after isolation of
tumors with the GentleMACS single cell isolation protocol
(Miltenyi Biotec).
Flow cytometry
Staining of cellular markers was previously described (22).
Mouse cells were stained with allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated antibodies against CD11c, CD8, and Foxp3; ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibodies against CD86,
CD11b, and CD4; phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies
against Thy1.1, CD25, MHC II, and PD-1 (BD Biosciences), and
biotinylated antibodies against CD40, CD80, and Gr-1 (prepared in-house). The latter were detected by streptavidinﬂuorochrome conjugates. Calreticulin (CRT) was detected by
a rabbit anti-mouse CRT antibody and a polyclonal swine antirabbit IgG-APC (Abcam). Human cells were characterized with
APC-conjugated antibodies against CD11c and PE-conjugated
antibodies against CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR (BD Biosciences). Data were acquired on a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FACSDiva or FlowJo
software.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay
CD90þ T cells were isolated from single-cell suspensions obtained from MO4 tumors by magnetic-activated
cell sorting (MACS). These T cells, containing on average
81.2%  1.5% CD8þ T cells (data not shown), were cultured
in a 96-well round bottom plate at a 1:1 ratio with 2  105
B16F0 or MO4 cells labeled with 0.5 or 10 mmol/L carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidine ester (CFSE), respectively. The following day, the cells were collected, pooled
per condition, and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. A pool of
B16F0 and MO4 cells, which were not cocultured with
T cells served as a control. The percentage speciﬁc lysis
was calculated as described in the work of M. Dullaers and
colleagues (25).
In vitro T-cell stimulation
CD11cþ cells were isolated from the tumor draining lymph
node as described (18). OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells were
obtained from the spleen of OT-I mice by positive selection
(Miltenyi Biotec). These cells were cocultured at a stimulator
to responder ratio of 1:10. Supernatants were collected the
following day, to determine IFN-g secretion by ELISA
(eBoscience). Proliferation of T cells was determined 4 days
later by incorporation of 3H thymidine (22).
Mouse DCs (22) were cultured at 5  105 DCs/mL in the
presence of 50% supernatants of dying tumor cells or Annexin
Vþ dying MO4 cells (MACS Dead Cell Removal Kit; Miltenyi
Biotec). The following day, their phenotype was evaluated
and compared with immature DCs and DCs matured with
10 mg/mL polyI:C (Sigma).
Human DCs from healthy HLA-A2þ donors (26) were cocultured at 5  105 DCs/mL with GFPþ HLA-A2 Annexin Vþ 888mel cells. The following day, their phenotype was evaluated and
compared with immature DCs and DCs matured with inﬂammatory cytokines (26). DCs that had engulfed dying cells (eGFPþ,
CD45þ, and CD11cþ) were FACS sorted (FACSAria; BD Biosciences) and used to stimulate TIL L2D8 in a 96-well round
bottom plate at a stimulator to responder ratio of 4:1. IFN-g
secretion was measured a day later by ELISA (eBioscience).
In vivo cytotoxicity assay
Tumor-bearing mice received an i.v. injection of 106
CD8þ OT-I cells 1 day before treatment. The in vivo cytotoxicity assay was conducted 5 days posttreatment as
described (25).
High mobility group box 1 ELISA and ATP assay
Cellular release of HMGB1 and ATP was measured in
supernatants collected 24 to 72 hours after transduction,
using the ELISA kit from Shino Test Corporation and
the luciferin-based ENLITEN ATP Assay from Promega,
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SEM. A one-way ANOVA
followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test was carried
out. Sample sizes and number of times experiments were
repeated are indicated in the ﬁgure legends. The number of

Results
Induction of apoptosis by LV-tSMAC results in enhanced
survival of tumor-bearing mice
To evaluate whether LV-tSMAC induces tumor cell death,
we transduced MO4, K1735-C4, and P815 cells in vitro with
LV-tSMAC or LV-tNGFR. Mock transduced cells served as
controls. Cell viability was assessed 3 days later, showing
induction of cell death upon transduction with LV-tNGFR. The
latter was enhanced when tSMAC was introduced (Fig. 1A–C).
Because LV-tSMAC induced cell death in vitro, we next
evaluated its therapeutic efﬁcacy. When compared with PBSor LV-tNGFR–treated mice, we observed a delayed tumor
growth in mice treated with a single intratumoral injection
of LV-tSMAC in the MO4 and K1735-C4 model (Fig. 1D and E).
Importantly, treatment of P815-bearing mice resulted in complete tumor regression (Fig. 1F).
To evaluate the mechanism behind this prolonged survival,
we assessed the induction of apoptosis in vivo upon treatment
of MO4 tumors. Three days posttreatment, tumors were isolated and cell lysates prepared for Western blot analysis.
We showed downregulation of survivin, upregulation of
caspase-3 and -9 but no differences in IAP expression in mice
treated with LV-tSMAC (Fig. 1G). To further assess the role
of survivin and caspases, we treated MO4-bearing mice with
LV-tSMAC alone or combined with injection of LV-survivin
or ZVAD-fmk. Mice treated with PBS or LV-tNGFR served as
controls. Only mice treated with LV-tSMAC showed a delayed
tumor outgrowth (Fig. 1H).
The therapeutic effect of LV-tSMAC involves effector
T cells
In vivo bioluminescence imaging carried out upon intratumoral injection of LV-luc2, showed modest transduction of tumor cells in situ (Fig. 2A). The low in situ transduction efﬁciency was conﬁrmed in ﬂow cytometry carried
out on cells obtained from LV-Thy1.1–injected tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). These data suggest that it is unlikely
that induction of cell death is the sole mechanism explaining
the therapeutic potency of LV-tSMAC, leading us to investigate whether LV-tSMAC induces antitumor immune
responses.
We evaluated the presence of DCs, T cells, regulatory T cells
(Treg), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the
MO4 tumor environment by ﬂow cytometry. We observed no
differences in DC or MDSC numbers between the differently
treated mice neither in the tumor nor in the spleen (data not
shown). Importantly, we observed that LV-tSMAC–treated
tumors contained a higher number of TILs, which expressed
low PD-1 levels compared with TILs from PBS or LV-tNGFR–
treated tumors. Moreover, a reduction in Treg numbers was
observed in LV-tSMAC–treated tumors (Fig. 2B and C, Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To evaluate the function of CD8þ TILs, we transferred OT-I
cells to MO4-bearing mice 1 day before treatment. Three days

later, CD8þ T cells were isolated from the tumor and cocultured with SIINFEKL-pulsed DCs. We observed that TILs
isolated from LV-tSMAC–treated mice secreted high levels of
IFN-g (Fig. 2D). Moreover, these TILs showed high speciﬁc lysis
of target cells in the in vitro cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 2E,
Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Subsequently, we evaluated the induction of OVAspeciﬁc CTLs upon LV-tSMAC treatment. Therefore, CD8þ
OT-I cells were transferred to MO4-bearing mice 1 day before
treatment. Five days later, an in vivo cytotoxicity assay was
conducted, showing potent lysis of target cells in mice treated

(Fig. 3C) before treatment was carried out to conﬁrm the role of
CTLs in the therapeutic effect of LV-tSMAC. Mice depleted of

DCs play a role in the immunologic effect of LV-tSMAC
We next addressed whether DCs isolated from tumor draining lymph nodes can activate OVA-speciﬁc T cells. Three days
after treatment, sorted CD11cþ cells were cocultured with
CD8þ OT-I cells. When compared with CD11cþ cells from
control mice, CD11cþ cells from LV-tSMAC–treated mice
stimulated CD8þ OT-I cells to produce high levels of IFN-g
(Fig. 4A) and to strongly proliferate (Fig. 4B).
DCs are activated upon engulfment of LV-tSMAC
transduced dying cells despite the absence of
immunogenic cell death
To identify the mechanisms underlying the observed
immune activation, we evaluated the exposure of CRT and

release of HMGB1 and ATP by tumor cells 24 to 72 hours after
in vitro transduction. Exposure of CRT on tumor cells transduced with LV-tSMAC but not on tumor cells treated with
PBS or LV-tNGFR was observed 48 hours after transduction
(Fig. 5A). However, we did not observe any release of HMGB1
or ATP by the in vitro transduced tumor cells, although both
were released when tumor cells were treated with mitoxantrone (Fig. 5B and C). To further address the involvement of
ATP in the therapeutic effect of LV-tSMAC, we treated MO4bearing mice with LV-tSMAC alone or in combination with
the enzyme apyrase to degrade ATP. Mice treated with PBS or
LV-tNGFR served as controls. Mice treated with LV-tSMAC in
the presence of apyrase showed a similar delay in tumor
growth as mice treated with LV-tSMAC (Fig. 5D).

Figure 3. The therapeutic effect of LV-tSMAC is dependent on CD8 T cells. A and B, an in vivo cytotoxicity assay was conducted in MO4-bearing mice that
received CD8þ OT-I cells. A, the ﬂow cytometry graphs show the speciﬁc lysis of OVA-pulsed targets (CFSEhigh) and are representative for 2 experiments.
B, the graph summarizes the results of the in vivo CTL assays. Each dot represents an individual mouse. The horizontal line depicts the mean. C and
D, MO4-bearing mice received an i.p. injection of PBS or 50 mg of an anti-CD8 antibody 24 and 2 hours before treatment (5 mice per group). C, depletion of
CD8þ T cells was veriﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. The results shown are representative for 3 mice. D, the graph shows the growth curves of tumors injected
with PBS (CTRL), LV-tNGFR, or LV-tSMAC in mice depleted or not of CD8þ T cells. E, to assess the presence of memory T cells, DBA/2 mice that were
cured (Fig. 1C) were challenged with viable P815 cells. Naive mice served as a control. The graph shows the growth curves.

To further evaluate a role for HMGB1, we evaluated the
phenotype of wild-type and TLR4 KO DCs incubated with
tumor cell–conditioned media or Annexin Vþ cells from LVtSMAC- or mitoxantrone-treated tumor cells. The phenotype
of both DC types was not altered when compared with immature DCs incubated with media obtained from LV-tSMAC–
transduced tumor cells. As expected, incubation of wild-type
DCs but not TLR4 KO DCs with medium obtained from
mitoxantrone-treated cells induced upregulation of matura-

tion markers. When both DC types were cultured in the
presence of Annexin Vþ cells, we observed an upregulation
of maturation markers. Of note, this was most pronounced
upon coculture with Annexin Vþ cells from LV-tSMAC–transduced tumor cells (Table 1).
As we could not evidence a role for ATP or HMGB1
but showed that uptake of LV-tSMAC–transduced Annexin Vþ
cells by DCs results in their activation, we addressed whether
mice could be protected from a subsequent challenge with

restricted to melanoma cells with the huTYR promoter. Using
GFP as a reporter, we showed that the huTYR promoter
restricted the expression to tyrosinaseþ cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). However, the expression of GFP was low when
compared with the expression upon transduction with
CMV-containing LVs. Therefore, we increased the MOI used
for transduction, showing high GFP expression when an
MOI of 5 was used (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly,
transduction of melanoma cells with targeted LVs encoding
both tSMAC and GFP at MOI 5 resulted in induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 6A). We next evaluated the exposure of CRT
and release of HMGB1 and ATP by 888-mel cells transduced
with LV-tNGFR or LV-tSMAC. Mock-transduced cells served as
a control. Similar to our observations with mouse tumor cells,
we observed expression of CRT (Fig. 6B) but no release of
HMGB1 (Fig. 6C) or ATP (Fig. 6D) after transduction with LVtSMAC.
Subsequently, we showed the uptake of dying 888-mel cells by
a signiﬁcant fraction of immature HLA-A2þ DCs (Supplementary Fig. S2C, Fig. 6E). Phenotypic analysis of these DCs showed
an enhanced expression of CD80 and CD83 (Fig. 6F). Finally, we
showed that these DCs stimulate production of high levels of
IFN-g by HLA-A2/gp100-speciﬁc T cells (Fig. 6G).

Discussion
In this study, we report on the potency of LV-tSMAC to
induce apoptosis of tumor cells of different histological origin,
i.e. melanoma and mastocytoma cells. We demonstrated the
anti-tumor efﬁcacy of this strategy together with the underlying immunologic mechanisms. To our knowledge, we are the
ﬁrst to demonstrate that LV-tSMAC induced cell death results
in anti-tumor immunity, which is mediated by a crosstalk
between DCs and T-cells.
Previously McNeish and colleagues (12) showed that
transduction of ovarian cancer cells with adenoviral vectors
encoding tSMAC resulted in induction of tumor cell death.
Our data extend these ﬁndings to melanoma and mastocytoma cells, which is of importance as it has been suggested
that the role of SMAC can vary depending on the cell type

1350

Cancer Res; 72(6) March 15, 2012

(27). Of note, we achieved substantial induction of cell death
using an MOI as low as 1. We hypothesize that the high
efﬁciency we observed is attributed to the use of LVs as a
delivery system. We previously showed that LVs activate
TLR3 (17, 18), which is important as it has been described in
melanoma that TLR3 engagement leads to a TRIF-dependent activation of caspase-8 hence results in induction of
apoptosis (16). We indeed observed that transduction of
melanoma cells with LVs encoding a reporter had an effect
on melanoma cell death. Importantly, it was described for
melanoma (16) and other cancer types (28) that SMAC
mimicry and TLR3 triggering synergize to induce apoptosis.
This could explain the potency of LV-tSMAC in our tumor
models. Moreover, a single injection of 107 TU of LV-tSMAC
was sufﬁcient to prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice.
Herewith, we conﬁrm the feasibility of delivering LVs to
tumor cells in situ to induce tumor cell death, a strategy that
was previously explored by others, delivering among others
suicide genes (29, 30).
On the basis of the low in situ transduction efﬁciency, we
hypothesized that the prolonged survival might be due to an
immunologic component resulting from the LV-tSMAC–
induced cell death. A ﬁrst observation that corroborates this
hypothesis is the inﬁltration of effector T cells within tumors
treated with LV-tSMAC. Moreover, these T cells showed a low
expression of PD-1, a receptor expressed on so called
exhausted T cells (31). Our observation that these T cells in
contrast to the highly PD-1þ T cells from control animals, could
be stimulated in vitro to produce high amounts of IFN-g and kill
target cells conﬁrms that PD-1 is critical in the suppression of
TILs (32, 33). In addition, we observed only a low percentage of
CD4þ CD25þ Foxp3þ T cells. These Treg actively contribute to
inhibition of effector T cells and APCs through various
mechanisms (34–36). Importantly, both the inﬁltration of
CD8þ T cells (37) and the "loss" of Treg (38) in the tumor
environment have been shown to be predictive for therapeutic
outcome. We next showed that CD11cþ cells from tumor
draining lymph nodes stimulate T cells that recognize the
model antigen OVA, which is expressed by MO4 cells. This
observation suggests that DCs take up dying tumor cells,

migrate to draining lymph nodes, process tumor antigens, and
acquire a mature phenotype that enable them to activate
antigen-speciﬁc T cells. Although Bonnotte and colleagues
(39) succeeded in showing the presence of DCs that had
engulfed FITCþ dying tumor cells in draining lymph nodes,
attempts to visualize trafﬁcking of DCs that had taken up
GFPþ dying MO4 cells using a similar experimental set up
failed in our hands. Consequently, we were unable to
analyze the phenotype of DCs that engulfed dying cells in
vivo. However, in vitro analysis of wild-type and TLR4 KO
DCs that were exposed to dying cell–conditioned media or
Annexin Vþ cells showed that DCs are activated only when
dying cells are engulfed. This suggests that LV-tSMAC does
not induce immunogenic cell death as deﬁned by the
exposure of CRT (40), release of HMGB1, and ATP (41), as
the latter would result in DC activation through interaction
with TLR4 and/or the receptor P2X7. Indeed, we only
observed exposure of CRT, although we did not observe
release of HMGB1 or ATP (42).
Using a human melanoma model, we showed that human
DCs engulf dying cells, resulting in their maturation and
presentation of the tumor cell–derived antigen gp100 to establish TILs. This observation strengthens our view that the
induction of antitumor immune responses is dependent on
the capacity of DCs to engulf dying cells, mature, and migrate
toward T cells to present tumor antigen–derived peptides. A
ﬁnal observation that strengthens this view is the induction of
CTLs in vivo.
Our data show the potential of LV-tSMAC as a strategy to
target the tumor from within. Despite its promise, the clinical

application of this type of therapy must be approached with
caution (43). Undoubtedly a prerequisite for the translation
of LV-based strategies to the clinic is restricting transgene
expression to target cells. As shown, the latter can be
accomplished by the use of target cell–speciﬁc promoters.
Moreover, strategies to direct the transduction pattern of LVs
using cell-speciﬁc nanobodies will further improve the safety
and potential efﬁcacy of LVs as an off-the-shelf therapeutic
(44, 45).
In conclusion, LV-tSMAC–induced tumor cell death elicits
antitumor immune responses mediated by a cross-talk
between DCs and T cells.
