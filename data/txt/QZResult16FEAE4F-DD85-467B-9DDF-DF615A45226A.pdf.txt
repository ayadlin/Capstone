ABSTRACT
Objective: The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) plus radiotherapy in patients with brain metastases (BM) of
non-small cell lung cancer.
Methods: Medline PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Oxford Journals
Collection, clinical trials and current controlled trials were searched to identify
relevant publications. After screening literature and undertaking quality assessment
and data extraction, the meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software.
Results: Eight controlled trials (980 participants) were included in the study.
Compared with radiotherapy without TKIs (non-TKI-group), TKIs plus radiotherapy
(TKI-group) had a significant benefit on objective response rate (ORR) (RR = 1.56,
95%CI [1.25,2.03]; P =0.0008), significantly prolonged the time to central nerves
system progression (CNS-TTP) (HR =0.58, 95% CI [0.35, 0.96]; P =0.03) and
median overall survival (MOS) (HR =0.68, 95% CI [0.47, 0.98]; P =0.04) of NSCLC
patients with BM. There was no significant difference in overall severe adverse events
(Grade≥3) (RR = 1.49, 95% CI [0.88,2.54]; P = 0.14) between two groups.
Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed TKI-group produced superior response
rate when compared with non-TKI-group. TKIs plus radiotherapy significantly prolong
the CNS-TTP and MOS of patients without enhancing overall severe adverse events.

INTRODUCTION

of radiotherapy. Recent studies of radiotherapy in
combination with conventional chemotherapeutics agents,
such as platinum, nitrosourea, paclitaxel, temozolomide,
suggest no significant improvement in OS compared with
radiotherapy alone [10-15] owing to their low capacity of
penetrating the brain-blood barrier (BBB). Thus, optimal
treatment modalities are urgently needed for NSCLC
patients with BM.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which
expresses in a variety of human cancer cells, including
ovarian, breast, colon, prostate and NSCLC [16, 17], is
a transmembrane receptor protein identified primarily on
cells of epithelial origin [18]. Autophosphorylation of its
intracellar domain initiates a cascade of events leading to
cell proliferation.

Worldwide, lung cancer ranks a top occurrence
rate among malignant tumor with a rare 5-years survival
rate (<15%) [1], of which non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounts for about 80%. Approximately 2040% [2, 3] of NSCLCs develop brain mestastases (BM)
with poor overall survival (OS) of only 3-6 months and
severe neurological symptoms [4-6]. Current treatment
options include surgical resection, whole brain radiation
therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone or
combined strategies. Radiotherapy remains the standard
therapy for BM from NSCLC, however, long term results
remain disappointing with a median survival time in
the range of 2.4-4.8 months [7-9] due to the limitations

RESULTS

Fortunately, EGFR signal pathway can be blocked
by small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
including gefitinib and erlotinib, which targeting the
EGFR to suppress cancer cell proliferation, invasion
and metastases [19, 20]. Currently, TKIs have become
increasingly important medications for advanced
NSCLC treatment. Some studies showed favourable
efficacy and safety in treating patients with BM [2125] while other studies failed to confirm that [26, 27].
The role of TKIs plus radiotherapy for the treatment
of BM patients is contraversial. Therefore, we have
conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and
safety of TKIs plus radiotherapy versus regimens with
conventional chemotherapeautic agents plus radiotherapy
or radiotherapy alone.

Selection of studies
Totally, 2460 studies were screened which met our
selection criteria after searching the relevant databases;
456 of these studies were excluded due to duplication.
By verifying related terms in the titles and abstracts, 1967
irrelevant articles and another 29 unfit designed articles
were excluded after the full text was analyzed. Finally,
eight clinical control trials [21-28] were identified for the
present meta-analysis. A flowchart depicting the study
selection is shown in Figure 1.

adenocarcinoma (61%) .

Methodological quality

There were 980 patients with BM originating from
NSCLC in the eight selected controlled trials, consisting
of 374 patients with TKIs combined with radiotherapy,
376 patients with only radiotherapy, and 230 patients
with conventional chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. These
results are summarized in Table 1. Among these eight
included studies, one was phase III clinical trials [27],
three were phase II studies [21, 26, 28], and four studies
didn’t mention a trial phase [22-25]. Four of the studies
involved in TKIs plus radiotherapy (TKI-group) versus
radiotherapy alone (non-TKI-group) [21, 22, 24, 27],
the others were TKIs combined with radiotherapy (TKIgroup) versus conventional chemotherapy combined with
radiotherapy (non-TKI-group) [23, 25, 26, 28]. Among
all of the included studies, conventional chemotherapy
drugs included placebo, temozolomide (TMZ),
VMP, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, platinum, and other
chemotherapy agents. Outcomes included ORR, MOS,
CNS-TTP, and overall severe adverse event (grade≥3).
Data for all characteristics are summarized in
Table 2. Sex, RPA(Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
Recursive Partitioning Analysis), KPS (Karnofsky
performance score), ECOG (Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group), No.of BM (number of brain
metastases), extra-cranial metastases, histology were
available for 6, 4, 4, 2, 6, 6, 6 of the 8 trials , respectively.
Based on the available data, the histology of NSCLC were

In accordance with the recommendations of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews, we evaluated
the eligible studies using the four aspects mentioned
above. Four studies [23, 26, 27, 28] mentioned the use
of random allocation, but only two of them discussed the
methods [27, 28]. One study [21] performed or reported
their allocation concealment and blinding methods. None
of the trial reported follow-up information. All of the
articles applied the intent-to-treat analysis. Seven of the
eight eligible studies received B quality scores, only one
received C quality scores, as shown in Figure 2.

Local response rate
Three of the included studies [21-23] reported
response rate of treatment using TKIs plus radiotherapy
versus conventional chemotherapy plus radiotherapy or
radiotherapy alone. Zhuang et al. [21] reported intracranial
tumor ORR in the erlotinib plus WBRT and WBRT alone
groups were 95.65% and 54.84%, respectively. Fu et al.
[22] reported intracranial tumor ORR in the gefitinib
plus WBRT/SRS and WBRT/SRS alone groups were
31.6% and 15.4%, respectively. Wang et al. [23] reported
intracranial tumor ORR were 54% and 47% in the gefitinib

combined with 3D-CRT and VMP combined with 3D-CRT
arms, respectively. A fixed effects model was used for
the meta-analysis of these studies because heterogeneity
did not exist (P = 0.24, I2 = 29%). The results indicated
that TKI-group produced superior response rates when
compared with non-TKI-group (RR = 1.56, 95%CI [1.20,
2.03]; P =0.0008) as showed in Figure 3.
Seven of the studies [21, 23-28] reported median
overall survival (MOS) for both patient groups. Analysis
using a random effects model based on the heterogeneity
values (P = 0.0002, I2 = 77%) of these studies suggested
that in NSCLC patients diagnosed with BM, TKIs
combined with radiotherapy significantly prolong
MOS when compared with conventional chemotherapy
combined with radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone
(HR =0.68, 95% CI [0.47, 0.98]; P =0.04) (Figure 4A).
The funnel plot indicated that there was no significant
publication bias for included studies on MOS(Figure
4B). Subgroup analysis of TKI plus radiotherapy versus
chemotherapy plus radiotherapy also demonstrated a
desirable MOS in TKI-group (HR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.47,
0.80]; P = 0.0004) (Figure 5). Four studies [21, 24, 26,
27] reported CNS-TTP, and only three [21, 24, 26] with
complete data were included in the analyzing using a

random effects model based on the heterogeneity values (P
= 0.03, I2 = 71%), suggesting that TKIs plus radiotherapy
significantly prolonged CNS-TTP (HR = 0.58, 95% CI
[0.35, 0.96]; P = 0.03) (Figure 6);

Adverse events
Six enrolled studies had analyzed the treatmentrelated toxicity and adverse events, one of them (73
patients) [23] was excluded for not reporting the sufficient
information of severe adverse events grading. A random
effects model was used for the overall severe adverse
events analysis of these studies based on the heterogeneity
values (P = 0.008, I2 = 71%). The results indicated that the
incidence of overall severe adverse events did not differ
between the TKI-group and non-TKI-group (RR = 1.49,
95% CI [0.88, 2.54]; P = 0.14) (Figure 7).
The most common adverse events of TKIs are rash,
fatigue, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea which are largely mild
and fairly tolerable, and pneumonitis rarely occurs. Thus,
we performed a subgroup analysis for the severe adverse
events as showed in (Figure 8 ). Regarding the fatigue,
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonitis, and other severe

adverse events, no difference were observed with (RR =
0.75, 95%CI [0.43, 1.32]; P = 0.32), (R = 1.34, 95%CI
[0.48, 3.70]; P = 0.58), (R = 1.47, 95%CI [0.60, 3.62];
P = 0.40), (R = 1.03, 95%CI [0.15, 7.10]; P = 0.97), (R
= 1.44, 95%CI [0.64, 3.26]; P = 0.38). However, rashes
were significantly more common in TKI-group (RR =
6.02, 95%CI [1.95, 18.59]; P = 0.002).

27].

In summary, the present study suggests TKIs
combined with radiotherapy produced superior response
rates, markedly prolong the CNS-TTP and MOS of
NSCLC patients with BM without significantly enhancing
overall severe adverse events. Moreover, it is possible to
improve the efficacy through increasing the dosage of
TKIs. TKIs plus radiotherapy probably open a promising
avenue for treating NSCLC patients with brain metastases.

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Currently, local radiotherapy treatment remains
the standard regimen of BM patients from NSCLC [32].
Several studies have certified that radiotherapy with
chemotherapy benefits NSCLC patients with BM [33-35].
However, because penetration of most chemotherapeutic
drugs into the central nervous system (CNS) is isolated
primarily by the BBB [36], the treatment was unsatisfied
at curing malignant BM lesions. Being small-molecule
agents, TKIs possess great advantage to penetrate
the BBB. The molecular pathways that mediate brain
colonization and the alternative to traditional therapy in
clinical investigations in BM from NSCLC have drawn
widespread attention [37-41]. One pre-clinical study [42]
showed that 14C radiolabeled gefitinib could be detected
in the CNS of healthy mice after oral dose of gefitinib
reached peak plasma concentrations, which suggested
that gefitinib could penetrate the BBB, other studies [4346] also showed that erlotinib appear good permeability
through the BBB. Additionally, radiotherapy, immature
tumor angiogenesis and edema might amplify the
destruction of the BBB and enhanced TKIs uptake and
elevated TKIs concentration in cerebrospinal fluid [4753]. After penetrating into the BBB, TKIs exert their anticancer efficacy via following two mechanisms: one is
competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the other
is to provide sufficient radiosensitizing and therapeutic
level in the brain [54-58]. Recently, Togashi et al. [45]
reported that CSF concentrations of erlotinib depend on
its plasma concentration, and a high-dose administration
of erlotinib could lead to its high CSF concentrations,
therefore improved its efficacy, especially to refractory
CNS metastases of NSCLC patients.
Compared with the conventional chemotherapeutic
agents, TKIs appeared favorable effect in treating NSCLC
patients with BM [23, 25, 28], which mainly resulted from
the distinctive property of the drugs, including their small
molecular structure and unique anti-tumor mechanism.
Meanwhile, the most common adverse events of TKIs
contain fatigue, rash, nausea , vomiting, diarrhea which
in most cases are mild and tolerable, and interstitial
pneumonia rarely appears. Our study demonstrated that
there was no significant difference in overall severe
adverse events between the TKI and non-TKI groups,
except a tendency that non-TKI group had lower incidence
of severe adverse events. This may due to the absence of
chemotherapy in most of the non-TKI groups [21, 22, 24,

Search strategy
Medline PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science,
Oxford Journals Collection, randomized controlled
trials (RCT) or clininal controlled trails were searched
to identify relevant studies in the published literature.
The search was performed on December 1, 2014, using
both mesh and free text words. The following basic
search terms were used: non-small cell lung cancer, brain
metastasis, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, erlotinib,
afatinib, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, WBRT, SRS, threedimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). The
search was performed without any language limitations.

Trial identification criteria
All projects which met the following criteria
were eligible: (1) RCT or clinical controlled trails
with voluntarily enrolled patients; (2) Patients had
histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC and had
been diagnosed with brain metastases using CT or MRI;
(3) The trials were TKIs plus radiotherapy (WBRT/ SRS/
3D - C RT alone or in combination) which were considered
as TKI-group versus conventional chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone (both were considered
as non-TKI-group). (4) Trials excluded patients with
double or multiple primary cancer or presence of unstable
systemic disease. (5) The analyses included objective
response rate (ORR), OS, time to central nerves system/
neurological progression (CNS-TTP) / neurological
progression-free survival (nPFS)/local progressionfree survival (LPFS) / progression-free survival of
intracranial disease (PFSI) (all were considered as CNSTTP in this study) , severe adverse events (Grade≥3);
(6) Response rate was determined using the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.0 or 1.1
version) [21-23]. Complete remission (CR) was defined
as disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial response (PR)
was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline

sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as
at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study),
in addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression). Stable disease (SD) was defined
as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference
the smallest sum diameters while on study. (7) Adverse
events was evaluated according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0) [22, 26, 27, 28].

Statistical analyses were performed using
RevMan5.3. Chi-square and I-square tests were used
to test the heterogeneity of different studies [29]; no
heterogeneity was considered to exist when P > 0.1 and
I2 < 50%, a fixed-effect model was applied to pool the
study results. Significant heterogeneity was found if P <
0.1 and I2 > 50%, and a random-effects statistical model
was used [30]. ORR, severe adverse events (Grade≥3)
were analyzed using dichotomous variables. OS, CNSTTP were calculated using effect variables. Hazard ratios
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted
from papers or from the survival curves when HRs were
not available using the methods described by Zhou et al.
[31] for CNS-TTP and OS. The event and total number
of patients from TKI-group and non-TKI-group in the
papers for object response rates (ORR) and severe adverse
events, event-based relative risks (RR) with 95% CI were
determined for ORR and severe adverse events extracted
from 62.5% of the trials [21, 22, 26-28]. Publication bias
was identified via funnel plot.

Study selection
The eligibility assessment was first performed by
screening titles and abstracts and subsequently reviewing
the full text of articles. The selection of all studies was
executed independently, according to the inclusion criteria,
by two reviewers [Shuimei Luo and Xiuping Chen].
Disagreement on whether an article should be included
was resolved using a third reviewer [Xianhe Xie].
