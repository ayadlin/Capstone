ABSTRACT
Grifolin, a secondary metabolite isolated from the fresh fruiting bodies of the
mushroom Albatrellus confluens, has been reported by us and others to display potent
antitumor effects. However, the molecular target of grifolin has not been identified and
the underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, we report that the
ERK1/2 protein kinases are direct molecular targets of grifolin. Molecular modeling,
affinity chromatography and fluorescence quenching analyses showed that grifolin
directly binds to ERK1/2. And in vitro and ex vivo kinase assay data further demonstrated
that grifolin inhibited the kinase activities of ERK1/2. We found that grifolin suppressed
adhesion, migration and invasion of high-metastatic cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of
grifolin against tumor metastasis was further confirmed in a metastatic mouse model. We
found that grifolin decreased phosphorylation of Elk1 at Ser383, and the protein as well
as the mRNA level of DNMT1 was also down-regulated. By luciferase reporter and ChIP
assay analyses, we confirmed that grifolin inhibited the transcription activity of Elk1 as
well as its binding to the dnmt1 promoter region. Moreover, we report that significant
increases in the mRNA levels of Timp2 and pten were induced by grifolin. Thus, our data
suggest that grifolin exerts its anti-tumor activity by epigenetic reactivation of metastasis
inhibitory-related genes through ERK1/2-Elk1-DNMT1 signaling. Grifolin may represent
a promising therapeutic lead compound for intervention of cancer metastasis, and it may
also be useful as an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor as well as an epigenetic agent to further
our understanding of DNMT1 function.

and therapeutic interest [1]. These compounds originate
as derivatives from many intermediates in primary
metabolism. Grifolin, a farnesyl phenolic compound,
is a secondary metabolite originating from the fresh
fruiting bodies of the mushroom Albatrellus confluens.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, natural agents such as the pool
of secondary metabolites produced by a variety of
mushrooms, has attracted a great deal of chemopreventive

It is also reportedly isolated from the edible mushroom
Boletus pseudocalopus [2]. Grifolin has shown various
microbiological and pharmacological effects [3–7]. The
anticancer activities of grifolin were first reported by our
group [8] and those previous studies showed that grifolin
inhibits the growth of cancer cell lines by inducing of
apoptosis and G1-phase cell-cycle arrest [9–11]. Another
study also demonstrated that grifolin induces apoptosis in
human osteosarcoma cells [12].
The ERK1/2 signaling consists of a three-tier
hierarchical cascade of protein kinases including RAF,
MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1/2)
and ERK1/2(extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2). The
ERKs cascade is frequently de-regulated in approximately
one-third of all human cancers [13–15]. And it is closely
associated with tumor cell inflammation, migration,
invasion and metastasis, suggesting that suppression of
ERKs signaling may represent a potential approach for
preventing cancer metastasis [15, 16].
Tumor cells require genetic and/or epigenetic
changes in order to be transformed into metastatic
cells. DNA methylation performed by a family of DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, plays a critical role
in epigenetic gene regulation in many forms of cancer
[17–19]. And aberrant hypermethylation of a significant
number of metastasis suppressor-related genes, as tissue
inhibitors of proteinases (i.e. TIMPs), cadherins, etc.,
have been widely investigated. Epigenetic interference of
hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes has been gaining
great attention as promising anticancer targets [20].
Here, we reports that grifolin inhibits the kinase
activity of ERK1/2 by physically binding to the respectiveATP pocket and impeding the downstream signaling.
The inhibition of the ERK1/2-Elk1-DNMT1 pathway by
grifolin led to the restoration of the function of metastasis
suppressor-related genes, Timp2 and pten, which interfered
the motility, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.

Collectively, these observations indicate that grifolin
inhibits the kinase activity of EKR1/2 in cells and in vitro,
which prompted us to determine grifolin’s mechanism of
action against ERK1/2.
We next used molecular modeling with the crystal
structure of ERK2 to determine whether grifolin could
bind to ERK2. To examine how grifolin combines with
ERK2, we docked it in silico to the ATP binding pocket of
ERK2 using several protocols in Schrödinger Suite 2011.
We found that grifolin formed an important hydrogen
bonds with Ile-29 at the backbone of ERK2, and also
formed hydrophobic interactions with ERK2 at Val-37
and Leu-154 (Figures 1E–1F). The molecular modeling
results of ERK1/2 infer a physical binding of grifolin to
ERK1/2. We thus tested this possibility using a number
of methods. First, we used affinity chromatography
analysis to determine whether grifolin binds to the
ERK1/2 proteins. Lysates prepared from CNE1 cells were
incubated with affinity columns of grifolin-Sepharose 4B,
EGCG-Sepharose 4B (as a positive control, which had
been reported in our previous study [21]) or Sepharose
4B beads (as a negative control). And the pulled-down
proteins were analyzed by Western blot. We found that
CNE1 cell lysates containing ERK1/2 combined with
grifolin-Sepharose 4B as well as EGCG-Sepharose 4B,
but not Sepharose 4B beads (Figure 2A, left). And nor
Akt/grifolin or p38/grifolin complexes was detected by
Western blot (Supplementary Figure S1). All the data
demonstrated that grifolin can bind with ERK1/2 in cells,
and the binding has certain specificity. Furthermore, to
assess the significance of grifolin binding with ERK1/2,
we used a cell-free system and Sepharose 4B beads as
a negative control. Results indicated that commercially
available active ERK2 did not combine with the Sepharose
4B affinity column, but did bind with grifolin-Sepharose
4B (Figure 2A, right).
Secondly, we investigated which domain of
ERK2 was involved in grifolin binding by generating
a truncation mutant, ERK2-ABD-T, in which the ATP
binding pocket was truncated and the skeleton of ERK2
remained. We also constructed site mutants of ERK2
(ERK2-ABD-S), in which Ile29,Val37 and Leu154 were
each mutated to Ala (Figure 2B). We then studied the
physical interaction between grifolin and ERK1/2 using
fluorescence quenching analysis. The His-fusion wildtype EKR1/2 proteins displayed maximal fluorescence at
334 nm (Figure 2C). When the His-ERK2 protein was
incubated with increasing concentrations of grifolin,
the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased. The
fluorescence intensity of ERK2-ABD-T (Figure 2D) and
ERK2-ABD-S (Figure 2E) did not change significantly
with increasing amounts of grifolin. Taken together, the
data indicate that grifolin physically binds to the ATPpocket of the ERK2 protein to inhibit ERK2 kinase
activity.

RESULTS
Grifolin physically binds to ERK1/2 to inhibit
ERK1/2 kinase activities
In previous studies, we found that grifolin
suppressed ERK1/2 kinase activity in a dose-dependent
manner in the CNE1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line
[9]. This effect was further confirmed in MCF7 human
breast cancer cell line (Figure 1A) and the HeLa human
cervical cancer cell line(Figure 1B). To determine whether
grifolin could inhibit ERK2 kinase activity in a cellfree system, active recombinant ERK2 was added with
ATP and an Elk-1 fusion protein in kinase buffer, Elk-1
phosphorylation was then detected by Western blot using
the phospho-Elk-1(Ser383) antibody. Grifolin significantly
inhibited ERK2 kinase activity in vitro (Figure 1C).

Grifolin suppresses motility and invasion of
metastatic carcinoma cells

decreased phosphor-ERK level in high-metastatic tumor
cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Furthermore, we
introduced mutant constitutively active MEK1 or MEK2
into 5–8F cells, and found both rescued the filopodia
formation suppressed by grifolin treatment(Supplementary
Figure S3A). All these data further correlate the
morphology change and inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling. It
indicates that grifolin suppresses the motility of metastatic
carcinoma cells through inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway.
Aberrant invasion is one of the main processes by
which cancer cells evade tissue boundaries to achieve
colonization at metastatic sites. To investigate the antiinvasion effect of grifolin, the infiltration of 5–8F cells through
Matrigel in a Boyden chamber assay was measured. Results
demonstrated that after 48 h treatment with 40 μM grifolin,
the number of cells that invaded into the lower chamber was
significantly reduced by 46.16%. Similar inhibitory effects
were also observed in MDA-MB-231 and MGC-803 cells
(43.4% and 43.74% inhibition, respectively) compared to
the DMSO control (Figure 3D). The reintroduction of active
MEK1 or MEK2 into 5–8F cells reversed the cell invasion
capacity inhibited by grifolin (Supplementary Figure S3B),
which indicates that grifolin exerts the anti-invasive activity
by impeding ERK1/2 pathway.

Constitutively active ERK1/2 signaling has been
shown to lead to increased tumor migration and invasion
[15, 16, 22, 23], thus we further investigated the potential
anti-metastatic activity of grifolin. Filopodia are associated
with cell motility and adhesion [24]. To determine
whether grifolin could inhibit filopodia formation,
metastatic nasopharyngeal 5–8F cells were treated with
40 μM grifolin for 24 h, and filopodia formation was then
observed using immunofluorescence to detect F-actin
(fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin). We found that
microspikes aggregated on the surface of the cell and
filopodia were enriched in the control; whereas in the
grifolin-treated group, filopodia or microspike structures
markedly decreased (Figure 3A).This was further
investigated in the highly metastatic human breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231 (Figure 3B) and in the gastric
cancer cell line MGC803 (Figure 3C). Compared with the
control, grifolin treatment significantly reduced filopodia
in 5–8F, MDA-MB-231 and MGC803 cells. Similar
results were observed after cells were treated with 40 μM
PD98059 for 24 h. In the meanwhile, grifolin remarkably

Elk1 transcription activity. We demonstrated that grifolin
decreased the phosphorylation of Elk1(S383) in 5–8F and
MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the untreated control
(Figure 5A). Treatment with grifolin attenuated the mRNA
level of dnmt1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5B).
Inhibition of DNMT1 expression was further confirmed at
the protein level by Western blot (Figure 5C).
Elk1 is a transcription factor belonging to the Ets
family and is capable of directly binding to consensus
sites (5′-A/CGGAA/T -3′) to exert transcriptional effects.
Several potential binding sites for Elk1 are present in the
dnmt1 proximal promoter (Figure 6A). To determine the
role of Elk1 in the transcriptional regulation of dnmt1, we
used a reporter construct containing a 2193bp fragment of
the dnmt1 promoter and increasing concentrations of Elk1
expression in dual-luciferase reporter assays in HEK293T
cells. We found that augmentation of Elk1 increased
dnmt1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 6B), which showed that Elk1 protein binding to
this site promoted the induction of dnmt1 transcription.
Furthermore, HEK293T cells were transfected with
the dnmt1 promoter-reporter construct. After overnight
incubation, cells were treated with grifolin for another 24
h followed by reporter expression analysis. In accordance
with the inhibition of the dnmt1 mRNA/protein
expression, grifolin dose-dependently reduced luciferase
activity driven by the dnmt1 promoter (Figure 6C).

To evaluate the effects of grifolin on tumor metastasis
in vivo, we first established stable expression of luciferase
in the highly metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell
line 5–8F (Supplementary Figure S4). Then 5–8F-Z cells
were injected into the tail veins of BABL/c nude mice to
establish a visualazable metastatic mouse model. These
same mice were treated with grifolin (32mg/kg/day) for
25 days, and metastsis was assessed. Bioluminescence
imaging (Figures 4A–4B) and hematoxylin-&eosin
(H&E) staining (Figure 4C) of lung tissue confirmed that
the incidence of metastasis was 60% (6/10) in the control
group. In contrast, in the grifolin-treated group, metastasis
significantly decreased to 18.2% (2/11, p < 0.05, Chi-square;
Figure 4D). Importantly, grifolin did not cause any adverse
effects compared with the control. The results indicated
that the metastatic activity of 5–8F-Z cells to the lung was
significantly abated by grifolin treatment.

Grifolin inhibits ERK1/2-Elk1-DNMT1 signaling
in metastatic carcinoma cells
To further explore the action mechanism of
grifolin on ERK1/2 pathway, we examined Elk1,
which is a downstream element of ERK1/2 signaling.

the recruitment of Elk1 to the dnmt1 promoter. It indicates
that grifolin decreases the transcription of dnmt1 through
inhibiting Elk-1 transcription activity as well as its binding
to the dnmt1 promoter region (Figure 6D).
To evaluate the function of grifolin to restrain
metastasis in tumors through the inhibition of DNMT1
signaling, we focused on a subset of genes whose
expression level was hypermethylated and strongly
correlated with the metastatic potential of tumors.
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), a tumor
suppressor gene, may suppress tumor cell growth
by antagonizing protein tyrosine kinases and block

We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) to examine the influence of grifolin on the ability
of Elk1to bind to the dnmt1 promoter. In this assay, each
of three potential binding sites in the dnmt1 promoter
was assessed individually for its ability to be enriched
by Elk1 immunoprecipitation. The most significant site
for Elk1 recruitment was chosen to apply the ChIP assay
sequentially (Supplementary Figure S5). Next, chromatin
was immunoprecipitated using either control rabbit IgG
or an Elk1-specific antibody, and the dnmt1 promoter
region surrounding the Elk1 binding site was amplified
by real-time PCR. Consistent with the luciferase reporter
data, results revealed that grifolin effectively suppressed

from the mushroom Albatrellus confluens, physically binds
to the ERK1/2 protein and inhibit their kinase activity,
thereby down-regulating the transcription of dnmt1 gene
by suppressing the downstream transcription factor, Elk1.
The inhibition of DNMT1 by grifolin leads to reactivation
of tumor-suppressor gene expression that could have an
important impact on tumor invasion and metastasis.
The adopted strategy in anticancer therapeutics as
well as cancer preventive agents development is based on
the discovery of precise molecular targets. It successes
in clinical trials and drugs such as sunitinib, sorafenib,
tamoxifen [32, 33] and finasteride [33, 34]. They have
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as cancer therapeutic or preventive agents. Indeed,
the ERK1/2 pathway has attracted much interest in the
search for new cancer therapeutics and several inhibitors
are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. These include
RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib/PLX4032, which
selectively inhibits BRAFV600E [35], and MEK1/2
inhibitors such as selumetinib (AZD6244/ ARRY-142886)
[36]. Yang et al. reported that ERK1/2 is a direct target
of caffeic acid for its attenuation of solar UV-induced
carcinogenesis [37].
In our previous study, we undertook a gene
expression profiling analysis to identify novel targets

through its interaction with focal adhesion. CpG island
hypermethylation has been identified as an alternative
mechanism of PTEN inactivation in a number of human
cancers [25–28]. TIMPs are a multigene family that binds
noncovalently to active MMPs in a 1:1 molar ratio and
inhibits their activity. Moreover, MMP/TIMP balance is
a major factor in the regulation of the proteolytic activity
of MMPs [29]. TIMP2 is also an endogenous inhibitor of
angiogenesis that is mediated by the activation of protein
tyrosine phosphatase activity [30]. The mRNA levels of
Timp2 and pten were markedly increased in 5–8F cells
following treatment with grifolin (40 μM) and a similar
effect was observed in cells treated with PD98059 (40 μM)
(Figure 6E). Thus, grifolin may exert anti-metastatic effect
through suppression of ERK1/2-DNMT1 signaling to
restore the function of metastatic suppressor genes.

DISCUSSSION
Extensive data are now accumulating showing that
natural dietary constituents can strongly influence the
potential for disease outcome [31]. Medicinal mushrooms
have an established history of use in traditional oriental
health care and therapy [1]. In this study, our results
provide strong evidence that grifolin, a natural compound

of grifolin and found that the MAPK pathway was
significantly inhibited in response to grifolin treatment
[9]. In vivo and in vitro kinase assay further revealed that
grifolin effectively abolished ERK1/2 kinase activity.
Considering this, we docked the compound to the ATP
binding site of ERK2. The hydroxyl group at the 2′ position
of grifolin could form a hydrogen bond with the backbone
atom of Ile29. In addition, grifolin would be sandwiched
by the side chains of the hydrophobic residues in the ATP
binding site including Val37 and Leu154. These hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic interactions maybe mainly
contribute to the potent inhibitory activity of grifolin
against ERK2. Fluorescence quenching experiments
showed that grifolin quenches the fluorescence of wildtype ERK2, but not the ERK2-ABD-S mutant, or ERK2ABD-T truncate, which indicates that grifolin physically
binds to the ATP pocket of ERK2. Additional evidence was
provided by affinity chromatography analysis. Therefore,
for the first time, we identified ERK2 is the direct target
of grifolin, to which grifolin can physically bind to and
functionally inhibit its activity.
Metastasis is accompanied by various physiological
alterations, such as filopodia formation, which allows
cancer cells to invade the blood or lymphatic system
and to spread to other tissue or organs [24]. The present
study demonstrates that grifolin exert an inhibitory effect
on the filopodia formation in 5–8F, MDA-MB-231 and
MGC803 cells. The data from a Matrigel assay and animal
experiment confirmed the inhibitory effects of grifolin.
These findings provide strong evidence for the antiinvasion/metastasis effect of grifolin in vitro and in vivo.
Aberrant epigenetic alterations generally results in
the repression of tumor suppression gene expression, and
may enable tumor cells to metastasize or have a selective
advantage at the secondary tissue site [38]. Many natural
compounds, such as EGCG, resveratrol, anacardic acid,
garcinol, plumbagin, curcumin and genistein can directly
influence epigenetic mechanisms in humans [39–42].
Natural compounds containing phenolic compounds have
been widely demonstrated to possess the capability to
prevent cancer invasion/metastasis. Catechin derivatives,
genistein/ genistin, silibinin, quercetin, and anthocyanin
have been widely investigated for their anti-metastatic
activities [43, 44]. We present clear evidence that grifolin,
a farnesyl phenolic compound, blocks ERK1/2-Elk1DNMT1 signaling and reactivation the transcription of
the Timp2 and pten genes. Beyond this, we have screened
a panel of tumor-suppressor genes in 5–8F cells and also
found that the pcdh10 and Timp1 genes were significantly
increased by grifolin (Supplementary Figure S6). Although
pcdh10 mRNA was induced by grifolin treatment, it
was still very low and marginally detectable. And by
bioinformatics prediction, we found that the promoter
region of the Timp1 gene lacked CpG islands, which
suggested that the augmentation of Timp1 transcription in
the presence of grifolin may be DNMT1-independent. In
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

previous study, we have shown that grifolin can inhibit
tumor cell survival [8, 12], which might contribute to the
suppression of metastases formation. Albeit this, here
we have provided an important mechanism that grifolin
blocks cancer cell invasion and metastasis by epigenetic
regulation of DNMT1 function.
In summary, our study demonstrates that grifolin
is an inhibitor of ERK1/2 as well as an antagonist of
DNMT1. The availability of this natural product will
represent a promising candidate lead compound in the
intervention of cancer invasion/metastasis by impeding
ERK1/2-Elk1-DNMT1 signaling.

Reagents and chemicals
The antibodies against ERK1, p38, Elk1 and
phosphor-ERK were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The antibody against DNMT1 was
from Epitomics. The antibodies against phosphor-Elk1
(Ser383), Akt, and p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. CNBrSepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech. PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem.
The coding region of human Elk-1 was cloned by
PCR and inserted into pcDNA3.1 vector to construct the
eukaryotic expression Elk-1 plasmid pcDNA3.1-Elk1. The
2193 bp dnmt1 promoter fragment was inserted into pGL3Basic vector (Promega) and the plasmid was designated as
pGL3-dnmt1. The full-length coding region of MEK1 with
mutations(S218,S222) or MEK2 with mutations(S222,S226)
was inserted into GV141 vector by XhoI and KpnI to
construct the eukaryotic expression constitutively active
MEK1 and MEK2 plasmids, respectively.
Grifolin (2-trans, trans-farnesyl-5-methylresorcinol)
was provided by Kunming Institute of Botany, the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (purity > 99%, HPLC analysis).
Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, Sigma) was used to
dissolve grifolin. The final concentration of DMSO in the
culture media was kept less than 0.1% v/v which had no
significant effect on the cell growth.

Qiagen). The purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS.
The His-fusion proteins were incubated with different
concentrations of grifolin. Protein quenching was monitored
at 25°C by using 5 nm of excitation and 5 nm of emission
slit-width. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the
emission spectra were measured between 285 and 450 nm.

First the three-dimensional (3D) structure of ERK2
was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID:
2OJJ). It is an X-ray structure with a 2.40 Å resolution
of the ERK2 in complex with (S)-N-(1-(3-chloro-4fluorophenyl) -2-hydroxyethyl) -4-(4-(3-chlorophenyl)
-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) -1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide [46]. The
protein was prepared for docking by using the Protein
Preparation Wizard in Schrodinger Suite 2011 [47].
All crystallographic waters were deleted and a 30-Å3
grid was generated based on the ATP binding site of the
protein receptor. Grifolin was prepared using LigPrep
of Schrodinger Suite 2011 under the OPLS_2005 force
field and a specifying pH value of 7.0. Several standard
procedures of Schrödinger’s GLIDE docking protocols
were performed. Procedures included docking with
standard precision (SP) or extra precision (XP) in GLIDE,
and the more CPU-intensive Induced-Fit Docking (IFD)
method with the default parameters, which were conducted
with SP and XP docking. All these docking procedures
allowed ligand docking flexibility and a total of 20 top
ranked structures were analyzed in IFD.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were fixed with 2.0% formaldehyde in PBS
for 30 min, washed with PBS three times, and treated with
PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, followed by
incubation with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Then
cells were stained with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanatephalloidin (Sigma) for 20 min and examined using TCS
SP5 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). Random
fields were counted for cells with filopodia.

Cell invasion assay
Cells were treated with the indicated concentration
of grifolin for 24 h. The inside of 8.0 μm pore-size cell
culture inserts (BD Biosciences) were coated with 0.75
mg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for 1 h. 5.0 × 104 cells
in serum-free media were placed inside each chamber.
Cells were allowed to invade for 48 h towards an attractant
of 10% fetal bovine serum. Chamber filters were fixed in
buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet. Random
fields were counted for invading cells under a light
microscope.

In vitro kinase assay
Elk1(1 μg) was used as the substrate for an in vitro
kinase assay with 100 ng of ERK2. Reactions were carried
out in 1 × kinase buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM
Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MnCl2] containing
100 μM ATP at 30°C for 30 minutes. Reactions were stopped
and phosphorylated Elk1 was detected by Western blot.

Evaluation of anti-metastatic acitivity of grifolin
in nude mice
Animal procedures were in accordance with the
standards established by the Guidelines for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of Central South University.
The 5–8F cell lines was engineered to stably express the
pLV.EX3d.P vector encoding luciferase. Cell suspensions
(105 cells in 0.1ml PBS) were injected into the lateral tail
vein of nude mice. The experimental group of nude mice
was administered grifolin once daily at a concentration of
32mg/kg body weight for 25 days starting on day 1 after
the cell injection. The control group was injected with the
corresponding corn oil solvent. Following intraperitoneal
injection with D-luciferin (150mg/kg), mice were exposed
to bioluminescence using the IVIS Lumina II (Xenogen).
Incidence of metastasis was quantified on the basis of the
luminescent signal in lung on day 25. The present study
protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the
Xiangya Medical School of Central South University.

In vitro and ex vivo pull-down assays
Recombinant ERK2 or a cellular supernatant fraction
(200 μg protein) was incubated with the grifolin-Sepharose
4B or Sepharose 4B only as control beads(50 μL, 50% slurry)
in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% NP40, 2 μg/mL bovine
serum albumin, 0.02 mM PMSF, 1 × protease inhibitor
mixture). After incubation with gentle rocking overnight
at 4°C, the beads were washed 5 times with buffer(50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mMDTT,
0.01% NP40, 0.02 mM PMSF), and proteins bound to the
beads were analyzed by immunoblotting.

Fluorescence quenching assay
Fluorescence spectra were measured as previously
described [48, 49] using a fluorescence spectrophotometer
(model F-4500, HITACHI). A His ERK2 fusion protein,
truncation mutant ERK2-ABD-T and site mutant ERK2ABD-S were expressed in the BL21 E. coli strain, followed
by purification using Ni-NTA (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid,
