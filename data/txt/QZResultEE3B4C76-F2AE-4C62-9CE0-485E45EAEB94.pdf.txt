Exploring Biomarkers in Head and Neck
Cancer
Corey J. Langer, MD

Personalized medicine based on predictive markers linked to drug response, it is hoped, will lead to improvements in
outcomes and avoidance of unnecessary treatment in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).
Recent research has shown that expression of ERCC1 may predict resistance to treatment with platinum agents.
Future testing for this marker may help select the optimal type of chemotherapy. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with less aggressive disease and better prognosis in locally advanced SCCHN treated with
chemoradiation or radiation alone; HPV-positive patients may ultimately benefit from less intensive, less toxic therapy.
K-RAS mutations, occurring in about 40% of colorectal cancers and associated with lack of benefit from epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies in this disease, are found in <5% of SCCHN patients, making routine testing for K-RAS mutations unwarranted at this time. Virtually all head and neck tumors overexpress EGFR, which limits
the usefulness of EGFR expression as a marker for treatment selection. Although the incidence of EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain mutations is very rare, a better understanding of the role of EGFR mutations, expression, amplification,
and downstream effects in SCCHN may help define the role of EGFR in this setting. These observations caution
against extrapolating results obtained with biomarkers in other types of cancer to SCCHN. Validation of each biomarker in the context of SCCHN clinical trials will be required before a specific marker can be incorporated into daily

An estimated 49,260 new cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) were diagnosed in the

United States in 2010.1 Most patients diagnosed with SCCHN present with locally advanced disease, for which a combined modality treatment approach with curative intent is usually prescribed. Cure rates with current combined-modality
strategies are favorable, but therapies are indiscriminately aggressive, often resulting in severe short-term toxicity and longterm functional impairment. Thus, a clear role for better patient selection to avoid unnecessary treatment and minimize
long-term toxicity is warranted.
By tailoring treatment to the specific genetic or molecular profile of a tumor in an individual patient, response and
survival outcomes could be improved through refined treatment decisions, treatment-related costs and complications
reduced, and unnecessary interventions avoided. Such refinements may also facilitate the development of newer, more
effective therapies. The understanding of biological markers in SCCHN is not as well defined as in other tumor types
(Table 1),2 such as breast or lung cancer, but recent advances have brought us closer to providing personalized medicine
for these patients. The following review provides an overview of some of the most relevant biomarkers related to SCCHN.
ERCC1
The ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementation group 1) protein plays an important role in repairing DNA damage
caused by platinum agents, and may therefore be useful in predicting which patients will benefit from platinum-based
therapy. Platinum agents work by creating DNA adducts that inhibit DNA replication and transcription in cancer cells.3
Cells that repair the damage efficiently are more likely to be resistant to platinum therapy.4,5 Removal of cisplatin-DNA
adducts is mediated by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) complex, a multistep process involving >30 distinct proteins

that recognize DNA damage, incise the lesion, resynthesize DNA, and ligate the repair patch; 1 of the key
enzymes in this pathway is ERCC1.6,7 Several groups
have linked low ERCC1 expression to platinum sensitivity in vitro,8,9 and some have shown that blocking the
expression or activity of ERCC1 increases sensitivity to
platinum agents.10-12 For example, Selvakumaran et al11
demonstrated that by modifying platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells to constitutively express antisense ERCC1
RNA, the cells were made to inhibit the capacity to repair
DNA damage and consequently reduce IC50 values for
platinum agents. The study also showed that mice transplanted with antisense cancer cells lived longer after
cisplatin treatment than those bearing control cells.
In primary tumor samples, pretreatment levels of
ERCC1 have been shown to predict outcomes after platinum therapy in patients with ovarian cancer,13 gastric
cancer,14 colorectal cancer,15 esophageal cancer,16 and
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).17-19
In lung cancer, Olaussen et al19 assessed whether
ERCC1 status predicted outcome after platinum-based
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with completely
resected NSCLC. ERCC1 status was determined in 761
samples (of the 1867 patients originally enrolled in the
International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial) using a semiquantitative H score based on the diffuseness and intensity
of ERCC1 staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC); the
median H score was used as the cutoff between ERCC1positive (44%) and ERCC1 negative (56%) disease. Platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy was found to be beneficial in patients with ERCC1-negative tumors, but not in
those with ERCC1-positive tumors. In the control group,
which did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, 5-year survival was significantly greater in patients with ERCC1positive disease than in those with ERCC1-negative disease (46% vs 39%). Hence, ERCC1 was both prognostic

and predictive. Subsequent to this study, the reliability
and specificity of the key reagent used to measure ERCC1
expression, the antibody 8.F1, has been called into question, which would cast doubts over the robustness of these
results.20
Cobo et al21 conducted 1 of the first prospective
randomized trials to select treatment based on ERCC1. In
this study, patients with stage IV NSCLC were randomized to a control group, which received standard therapy
with cisplatin/docetaxel, or an experimental genotypic
group, in which patients with low ERCC1 expression,
this time measured by mRNA expression, were treated
with cisplatin/docetaxel and those with high ERCC1
expression received a nonplatinum-containing regimen
(docetaxel/gemcitabine). Among the 346 evaluable
patients, the response rate was markedly increased in the
genotypic group (50.7 vs 39.3% in the control group; P ¼
.02); within the genotypic group, response rate was
53.2% for patients with low ERCC1 and 47.2% for the
high ERCC1 subgroup. However, no difference in survival was observed between the 2 treatment groups,
although the median follow-up time was short (9
months). Although these results are encouraging and suggest the potential to base treatment decisions on ERCC1
expression levels in the future, the high dropout rate
(17.6%), due primarily to insufficient tissue available for
ERCC1 mRNA analysis, suggests that better protocols for
ERCC1 testing are needed.
ERCC1 in head and neck cancer

Preliminary studies suggest ERCC1 has a role in
predicting patient response to cisplatin-based therapy in
SCCHN.22,23 Handra-Luca et al22 assessed the impact of
ERCC1 expression level (measured by IHC with the
aforementioned 8.F1 reagent) on outcomes after cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced
disease. Of the 96 pretreatment tissue samples analyzed,
68 (71%) had high expression of ERCC1. Patients with
low levels of expression had a 4-fold greater chance of
achieving an objective response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared with those with high levels of expression. After adjusting for age, disease stage, tumor
differentiation, and location, low ERCC1 expression was
a significant predictor of prolonged cancer-specific
survival. These findings suggest that pretreatment
ERCC1 expression levels are inversely correlated with
response and survival after cisplatin-based therapy.
Jun et al23 evaluated whether pretreatment levels of
ERCC1 expression (also by 8.F1-based immunostaining)

predicted survival in patents with locally advanced
SCCHN undergoing cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy. ERCC1 expression was measured using
IHC in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
from 45 patients. Most tumors (73%) had high ERCC1
expression. With a median follow-up of 53.6 months, the
estimated 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in those with low ERCC1 expression
compared with those with high expression (83.3% vs
49.4%). The 3-year overall survival (OS) was also significantly greater in those with low ERCC1 expression
(91.7% vs 45.5%). In a multivariate analysis, low ERCC1
expression was a significant and independent predictor of
prolonged survival.
Notably, the prevalence of ERCC1 overexpression
in both SCCHN studies was similar (71%-73%) and considerably higher than that reported in NSCLC (approximately 40%)19 using a similar scoring technique. This
suggests that the proportion and pattern of ERCC1
expression may vary by tumor type. Moreover, the
response rates observed in these studies suggest that a proportion of patients with high ERCC1 expression may still
respond to platinum therapy. Thus, the sensitivity of
ERCC1 as a predictor of platinum response in SCCHN
appears to be relatively low, and other factors—within the
NER pathway or beyond—may also influence tumor
response. Although the argument could be made that in
these studies cisplatin was combined with 5-fluorouracil
or taxanes, and therefore the magnitude of the ERCC1
effect could be at least partially confounded by the use of
multiple chemotherapeutic agents, the differences in outcomes between the ERCC1 groups in the Jun study were
consistent regardless of the chemotherapeutic agent partnered with cisplatin.22
From a practical perspective, it appears that high
ERCC1 expression in SCCHN tumors may suggest a low
probability of benefiting from platinum therapy. Patients
with this marker may be candidates for alternative
approaches, including nonplatinum therapy. However,
further validation is needed, including prospective trials
that evaluate strategies for assigning treatment in SCCHN
based on ERCC1 expression status. The most common
method for evaluating ERCC1 mRNA expression is
quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), which requires the collection of
fresh formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples.13-15,17 Commercial kits are available for testing
ERCC1 expression (via IHC or PCR-based techniques)
in other tumor types, such as lung and colon cancer, but

3884

not in SCCHN. Samples must be taken from tumors that
have not been irradiated (because fibrosis or radiationinduced necrosis may interfere with interpretation), a
requirement that may hinder the potential application of
ERCC1 as a biomarker in SCCHN.
In addition to the effect of ERCC1 levels on
response to platinum therapy, certain polymorphisms on
the ERCC1 gene may influence response of patients to
radiotherapy. In a study of 108 patients with stage II
SCCHN treated with radiotherapy only, Carles et al24
identified the homozygous genotype Thr259Thr as significantly associated with worse outcomes, for both time to
progression (median, 11.6 months vs >85 months for genotypes Lys259Thr or Lys259Lys; P ¼ .00005) and OS
(median, 27.9 months vs >88 months; P ¼ .0089). This
same study evaluated other genes encoding DNA repairrelated proteins, such as ERCC5 or XPA. Apart from
ERCC1, only 1 of the ERCC5 polymorphisms showed a
significant correlation with outcome; patients with homozygous T/T nucleotide at codon position 46 had shorter
time to progression (median, 56.7 months vs >81 months
for those with C/T or C/C; P ¼ .049) and worse survival
(median, 61.0 months vs >87 months; P ¼ .0066). If
validated, these findings may prove particularly relevant
to clinical decision making in a setting where there may be
a choice between radiation and surgical management.

RRM1
The RRM1 (ribonucleotide reductase M1) gene encodes a
regulatory subunit of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
that is the key molecular target of gemcitabine.18,25,26 Preclinical studies have shown that high levels or specific
mutations on RRM1 are associated with gemcitabine
resistance.3,27-30
Clinically, low RRM1 expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms have been found to correlate with
better outcomes in patients treated with gemcitabinebased chemotherapy in several solid tumors.18,29-31
The role of RRM1 in determining chemosensitivity
in SCCHN is unclear. However, its correlation with
ERCC1 expression and platinum sensitivity (although
weaker than its association with gemcitabine sensitivity)
suggest that the role of this biomarker in SCCHN
should be explored further. Studies evaluating not only
RRM1 but multiple related genetic markers, such as
RRM2 and BRCA1, may also provide a more comprehensive picture of the role of RRM1 in predicting treatment
outcomes.32

b-Tubulin Isotypes
Taxanes exert their anticancer activity by binding to
b-tubulin polymers and inhibiting microtubule depolymerization and mitotic progression. In preclinical models,
aberrant expression levels of the isotype III of b-tubulin
have been associated with resistance to paclitaxel in several
cell types.33,34
In the clinic, this relationship has been explored
mostly in NSCLC. Monzo et al35 showed the association
between tubulin mutations and lack of response and inferior outcomes in 49 patients with advanced NSCLC
treated with paclitaxel. More recently, Seve et al36 and
Dumontet et al37 have provided consistent results in 2
groups of patients (91 patients and 19 patients, respectively) treated with taxane-based therapy (paclitaxel or
docetaxel in combination with platinum, or docetaxel as a
single agent). Patients were classified as low or high btubulin-III expressing, according to whether their levels of
expression (by IHC) were below or above the median
value in the entire population37 or whether the number of
stained cells in the sample was < or >50%.36 Regardless
of the nuances of the scoring system, the low-expressing
patients exhibited higher response rates and longer PFS
and OS.
In SCCHN, docetaxel has become part of the standard induction regimen in combination with cisplatin and
R
5-fluorouracil. A correlative study to TaxotereV (TAX)
324,38 the phase 3 trial comparing induction with 5-fluorouracil to induction with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil
alone indicated that expression of b-tubulin II measured
by IHC (samples were scored by percentage of stained
cells and intensity of staining; positive results were those
above the median score and negative those below) may be
associated with outcomes. In the subset of evaluable
patients (265 of 501 patients enrolled), patients with low
expression had better PFS and OS, regardless of treatment
with or without docetaxel (OS hazard ratio [HR], 2.39; P
¼ .0001), suggesting a potential prognostic effect. Moreover, for this same subgroup with low expression, the benefit from the specific addition of docetaxel to the
induction therapy regimen seemed to be greater, whereas
in the high-expression group, there were modest or no differences in outcomes between the 2 induction regimens.38
As the use of taxanes in SCCHN grows, this marker
may assume a greater role in therapeutic decision making.
To date, there are no commercial assay kits to determine
expression of b-tubulin isotypes, and as described above,
there is some variation in the scoring systems reported in
the literature, indicating that a potential practical applica-

issues.

Human Papillomavirus
Virtually all cases of cervical cancer, and a subset of
SCCHN tumors, are linked to human papillomavirus
(HPV) infection.39,40 HPV-positive tumors in SCCHN
are almost always oropharyngeal, and the reported HPV
infection prevalence varies widely, depending on the
method of detection used. About 35% of overall head and
neck tumors have been reported to be HPV positive, as
detected by PCR.40 Specifically, HPV has been detected
most often in cancers of the tonsils (43.6%) and the base
of the tongue (38.4%).41 One of the largest and most
recent analyses of patients with oropharynx cancer from
RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) 0129
demonstrated a 64% incidence of HPV-positive tumors
using in situ hybridization techniques, suggesting that the
correlation of this infection and oropharynx cancer may
be greater than previously appreciated.42
The prevalence of HPV-related SCCHN may also
vary by geographic region. A global survey of oropharynx
cancer found that the prevalence of HPV infection was
18%43; another report indicated the prevalence was 38%
and notably higher in North America (47%) than in
Europe (28%).43 Furthermore, the prevalence of types of
SCCHN potentially related to HPV infection appears to
be increasing in the United States.40 The increase in
HPV-related tumors (eg, base of tongue, tonsil, oropharynx) has been noted in recent decades, particularly among
younger-age cohorts, whereas the incidence of cancers
typically unrelated to HPV (eg, tongue, gum, lip, other
oral cancers) has decreased. These trends may be
explained in part by changes in both sexual behavior and
smoking.
Of those head and neck tumors that contain HPV
DNA, up to 90% present with the oncogenic variant
HPV-16.44-46 Compared with tumors of the oropharynx
and oral cavity, tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma has
been most strongly and consistently associated with HPV16 infection; in these tumors, molecular analyses have
revealed variable HPV copy numbers, compared with low
copy numbers in other sites.46 Hence, a causative relationship between HPV and SCCHN is plausible, if not likely.
HPV-16 has been shown to immortalize epithelial cells of
both cervical and oral origin in vitro.47,48 This effect may
be mediated by inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb.49

Numerous studies have now shown that HPV infection is an independent risk factor for SCCHN. In an epidemiological study of nearly 900,000 serum samples from
healthy individuals in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, 292
cases of SCCHN were documented, occurring after a median of 9.4 years.50 The prevalence of seropositivity of the
oncogenic HPV-16 was nearly twice as high in SCCHN
patients than in controls (12% vs 7%). In a nested casecontrol study involving 130 consecutive patients with oropharynx cancer, the risk of oropharynx cancer was linked
to sexual behavior, lifetime exposure to HPV-16 (determined by seropositivity for HPV-16 LI capsid protein),
and the presence of HPV infection (any HPV or HPV16).44 Notably, the relationship between HPV-16 and
cancer risk was independent of tobacco and alcohol use.
After adjusting for age, sex, and alcohol use, HPV-16
seropositivity was found to be an independent predictor
of oropharynx cancer and accounted for 55% of all cases.
Beyond its role as a risk factor for developing
SCCHN, HPV status appears to define a distinct subtype
of SCCHN tumors, and ultimately may aid in shaping
treatment choices. Retrospective studies have consistently
shown that HPV-positive tumors have better response
and survival after treatment, possibly because of the propensity of these tumors to maintain an apoptotic response
to radiation and chemotherapy.51 Alternatively, these
patients tend to be younger and healthier compared with
other head and neck cancer patients, with fewer smokingrelated comorbidities; however, it is important to note
that in multivariate analyses of clinical trials, the prognostic effect of HPV is not driven by demographics alone.
The impact of HPV status on response and survival
was evaluated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) in a prospective multicenter phase 2

3886

study of chemoradiation as organ-preserving therapy in
96 patients with resectable stage III/IV laryngeal or oropharynx cancer. By using in situ hybridization techniques,
HPV DNA was detected in 40% of tumor samples; 63%
of oropharyngeal tumors were HPV positive, whereas
none of the laryngeal tumors evidenced HPV DNA. Most
positive cases involved HPV-16 (95%). Patients with
HPV-positive tumors had a higher response rate after
induction chemotherapy (82% vs 55%; P ¼ .01) and after
chemoradiation (84% vs 57%; P ¼ .007). OS was significantly longer in HPV-positive patients than in HPV-negative patients (alive at 2 years: 95% vs 62%). The lower
death and progression risk for HPV-positive patients was
still present after adjusting for age, disease stage, and performance status.45
Recent retrospective studies of large phase 3 trials
have solidified the clinical importance of HPV as a prognostic marker for SCCHN (Table 2). The phase 3 TROG
(Trans Tasman Oncology Group) 02.02 (HeadSTART)
trial randomized patients with stage III/IV SCCHN to
receive cisplatin/radiotherapy  tirapazamine; 465
patients had oropharynx cancer. Of the evaluable samples,
54 of 195 (28%) were HPV positive, and 107 of 186
(58%) were p16 positive. At the 2-year mark, HPV-positive tumors were associated with better OS versus HPVnegative tumors (94% vs 77%; HR, 0.27; P ¼ .007) as
well as improved failure-free survival (FFS; 85% vs 75%;
HR, 0.43; P ¼ .035). In addition, patients with p16-positive tumors had improved 2-year OS (92% vs 74%; HR,
0.35; P ¼ .004) and improved 2-year FFS (87% vs 72%;
HR, 0.38; P ¼ .003). Patients with both HPV and
p16-positive tumors had increased OS and FFS rates
compared with double-negative patients (OS: 95% vs
71%; P ¼ .003; FFS: 89% vs 69%; P ¼ .002).52

Similarly, analysis from the RTOG 0129 study, which
randomized patients to receive standard fractionation 70
grays (Gy) þ cisplatin or accelerated fractionation with
concomitant boost 72 Gy þ cisplatin, correlated HPV
status with patient prognosis. Of the evaluable samples,
206 of 323 (64%) were HPV positive, of which 96% were
HPV-16 positive. OS, PFS, and locoregional failure were
all significantly superior among HPV-positive patients at
2 years (OS: 87.9% vs 65.8%; P < .001; PFS: 71.8% vs
50.4%; P < .001; locoregional failure: 13.6% vs 24.8%;
P ¼ .004). Interestingly, heavy smoking status (20
pack-years) seemed to negate partially the benefit conferred by an HPV-positive tumor status; compared with
HPV-positive/<20 pack-year patients, HPV-positive/
20 pack-year patients had an OS HR of 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-3.05); for HPV-negative/<20
pack-year subjects OS HR was 2.25 (95% CI, 1.44-3.50),
and for HPV-negative/20 pack-year subjects OS HR
was 4.30 (95% CI, 2.40-7.71).41
More recently, Gillison and colleagues53 have performed an identical analysis of an older study, RTOG
9003, a randomized phase 3 trial comparing various radiation delivery schedules in locally advanced SCCHN. A
total of 1068 patients were randomized to standard fractionation, hyperfractionation, accelerated fractionation
with split, or accelerated fractionation with concomitantboost radiotherapy, all without chemotherapy. The final
analysis demonstrated no differences in PFS, locoregional
control, and OS among the trial arms. Consistent with
the observations from chemoradiotherapy trials, the retrospective analysis of 646 evaluable samples showed that
HPV-positive patients (identified by the surrogate marker
p16) had a 5-year survival rate of 49% compared with
19.6% for those who were HPV negative (P < .0001).
Finally, the observations from the subset of evaluable patients (111 of the 264 oropharynx cancer patients
enrolled) from the phase 3 trial TAX 324 that compared 2
induction chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with or without docetaxel total N ¼ 501) before
definitive chemoradiotherapy also were consistent, showing a strong prognostic correlation with HPV status. The
rate of HPV-positive tumors was 50%. At a median follow-up of 83 months, 79% of HPV-positive patients were
alive, versus 31% of those with HPV-negative tumors (P
< .0001).54
Together, these studies have definitively established
HPV as a meaningful prognostic marker for oropharyngeal SCCHN, and are sufficient to warrant accounting for
HPV status in the design and analysis of future clinical

trials using combined or sequential chemotherapy and
radiation. We have no such prognostic data in the setting
of surgery only.
Implications in SCCHN

The prevailing consensus at this time is that patients
with HPV-related disease should probably be considered
a distinct entity compared with patients with HPV-unrelated disease. Whether to stratify future trials on the basis
of HPV status or actually institute separate trials for
HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients remains
unclear, although consensus is clearly moving toward
separate trials, particularly because the clinical goals of
therapy are different. In patients who are HPV positive,
with less aggressive cancer and reasonably good survival,
the goal is to deintensify therapy and thereby reduce
toxicity. In HPV-negative patients, whose prognosis is
decidedly worse, alternative approaches focusing on new
targeted approaches and tolerable therapeutic intensification are desired.
Possible strategies for deintensification in HPV-positive disease include the administration of radiation or
platinum therapy at lower doses with or without taxanes
on a weekly basis, or the replacement of platinum therapy
with cetuximab. For instance, ECOG is completing
accrual to a phase 2 study of induction therapy followed
by concurrent cetuximab and either low-dose radiation or
standard radiation (intensity-modulated radiotherapy
[IMRT]) in HPV-positive, resectable oropharynx cancer
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01084083). As of September 2011, 79 of 86 patients targeted for accrual have
been enrolled. The phase III intergroup trial RTOG 1016
(see www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01302834), dedicated to
patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors, will
compare combination radiation and cetuximab to combination radiation and cisplatin. Patients are eligible if their
tumors are HPV positive as determined by p16 status,
and the radiation modality used is IMRT. The trial
includes an extensive panel of quality of life-related measures as secondary endpoints to assess any potential difference or advantage in functional outcomes with cetuximab
versus cisplatin, because the goal of this study is to pursue
better functional outcomes without jeopardizing efficacy.
As the prevalence of HPV infection and HPVrelated SCCHN increases,40,44,55 questions regarding
screening and prevention are raised. Screening serum samples for HPV-16 is reliable and requires only basic laboratory techniques.56 But the value of screening high-risk
patients for HPV infection has not been demonstrated,

3887

Review Article

and the best approach to treating HPV-related premalignant lesions detected by screening is unknown. Moreover,
whether identifying patients at high risk of contracting
HPV may improve early detection of SCCHN by raising
patient and physician awareness and increasing monitoring is unclear; the rising incidence of HPV infection raises
other issues, including the potential blanket institution of
vaccination strategies. To address these issues, a new multipronged approach to research is likely needed, involving
continued retrospective analyses and epidemiological
studies, prospective data collection and validation,
and the initiation of the first trials to stratify SCCHN
patients according to HPV status, as described above.
Cooperative trials that are collecting samples for HPV
assessment, such as the RTOG 0522 trial that compared
chemoradiation with or without cetuximab, showing no
differences overall with the addition of cetuximab,57
will help to determine the impact of HPV status on
outcomes following current standards of care (see www.
clinicaltrials.gov NCT00265941).
K-RAS
The ras family of genes, including H-RAS, K-RAS, and
N-RAS, encode a protein that resides on the cytoplasmic
side of the plasma membrane. The protein transmits mitogenic signals in response to a variety of physiological
stimuli.58 Currently, there is considerable interest in the
role of activated mutant forms of K-RAS in carcinogenesis.
Most of the attention has focused on colorectal cancer,
where the prevalence of K-RAS mutations is high (about
40%).59-61 In colorectal cancer, certain K-RAS mutations
are predictive of lack of benefit from epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting agents, and testing for
K-RAS mutation status is now recommended before treatment with EGFR therapy in this setting.62,63 Assays for
detecting K-RAS mutations include real-time PCR and
direct sequencing analysis62; commercial kits are available
for assaying K-RAS mutation status in colorectal cancer.
Whether K-RAS mutation status predicts response
to EGFR-targeted therapy in other types of cancer is
unknown. In SCCHN, the prevalence of K-RAS mutations is low. One study reported a prevalence of 8%,64 but
most reports are generally <5%, or as low as 2%.65,66
Although some evidence suggests that K-RAS mutations
may indicate enhanced proliferation and an aggressive disease course in SCCHN,65,66 their extremely low prevalence will likely preclude a major role in helping to define
treatment. At this time, there is no clinical benefit to testing for K-RAS mutation status before administering

3888

EGFR-targeted therapy to patients with SCCHN. Further evaluation of K-RAS, including the implications of
overexpression of wild-type K-RAS,67 is needed to better
define the potential prognostic and predictive role, if any,
of this factor in SCCHN.
EGFR and EGFRvIII
The EGFR is a transmembrane protein that generates an
intracellular signaling cascade that results in cell proliferation in response to extracellular binding with its natural
ligands, such as epidermal growth factor and transforming
growth factor (TGF)-a. Cells that acquire the ability to
overproduce these ligands or increase the number of
EGFRs on their surface can create an autocrine growth
pathway, resulting in uncontrolled growth.68,69
Virtually all SCCHN cases express EGFR according
to currently accepted assays,69,70 usually at high levels
(2þ, 3þ). Indeed, mRNA expression of EGFR and its
ligand TGF-a was increased in 24 tumor samples compared with normal mucosa samples taken from nonaffected individuals.69 There was no increase in EGFR gene
copy number. Notably, levels of EGFR expression were
also upregulated in normal mucosa from SCCHN
patients, suggesting that increased EGFR expression is an
early event in the development of SCCHN, and may help
to explain the high incidence of synchronous and metachronous disease observed in this type of cancer.
Overexpression of EGFR is a negative prognostic
factor associated with poor local control and survival in
patients with SCCHN.68,70,71 In a randomized trial evaluating cisplatin with or without cetuximab in patients
with advanced SCCHN, the highest levels of EGFR
expression by IHC were associated with diminished
responsiveness to cetuximab.72 It was also noted that
cetuximab-related skin rash tended to be less frequent in
those with the highest levels of EGFR expression. These
findings suggest that, in patients with very high levels of
EGFR, standard doses of cetuximab may be insufficient
to saturate the target receptor, resulting in less efficacy and
less toxicity. This may set the stage for dose-escalation
studies of cetuximab using either direct measurement of
EGFR expression or the clinical surrogate marker of skin
rash to gauge biological target effects.72
The very high frequency of EGFR expression in
SCCHN greatly limits the usefulness of classifying tumors
as simply positive or negative as a marker for selecting
treatment. The ability to quantify the EGFR expression
levels more precisely, however, may enhance the usefulness of this biomarker. The most commonly used method

for assessing EGFR expression levels is IHC of paraffinembedded tumor samples, although results can vary
depending on differences in technique, the type of antibody or fixative used, and the storage time of the sample.73 Fluorescent in situ hybridization can be used to
determine the EGFR gene copy number, but increased
EGFR gene copy number appears to be neither the main
cause of increased EGFR expression nor predictive of outcomes in patients with SCCHN.69,74 A new technique for
assessing protein expression known as the automated
quantitative analysis of protein expression may provide a
more accurate measurement of total and phosphorylated
EGFR expression in tumor samples.75 Use of this assay,
however, is in its fledgling stages and has yet to be thoroughly evaluated for its predictive ability.
EGFR variants

A mutant form of EGFR known as EGFRvIII has
been detected in up to 40% of SCCHN cases.76 This
truncated, constitutively active receptor is ligand independent and does not bind with antibodies that target the
extracellular domain of wild-type EGFR. In vitro, cells
that express EGFRvIII have been shown to be less sensitive to the growth-inhibiting effects of cetuximab. Notably, EGFRvIII is typically only seen in cells that
overexpress wild-type EGFR, which has led to the hypothesis that EGFRvIII mutations are a late stage event caused
by the rapid proliferation induced by wild-type EGFR
overexpression.76
Other alterations in EGFR include activating mutations, which have been detected in 10% to 30% of
patients with NSCLC and predict increased sensitivity to
small molecules that target the intracellular portion of

Cancer

EGFR.77,78 However, these mutations are present in just
7.3% of Asian patients with SCCHN who have been
evaluated for the mutation and in only 1% of evaluated
Caucasian patients with SCCHN, indicating that it is a
relatively rare mutation for this tumor type.77,79 Although
the practical applications of EGFR mutation status are
currently limited, further assessment of EGFRvIII and
other mutations in SCCHN is warranted.
Serum Profiling
Serum-based diagnostics offer a different type of
approach, less invasive and not dependent on the collection of tumor specimens. Markers in serum provide information on host factors that may determine response to
therapy.
Serum samples can be analyzed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This analysis generates a proteomic peak profile,
because most commonly the species detected in the sample are proteins or protein fragments. In NSCLC, a profile
of this kind has been characterized that may be prognostic
and/or predictive of benefit with EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapy.80 A retrospective study in 108
patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN treated with
cetuximab or EGFR TKIs revealed that patients with the
same proteomic profile (66% of the sample) derived
greater benefit from anti-EGFR therapy than those negative for the profile (HR for OS, 0.20 to 0.41, depending
on the agent). There was also a small numeric difference
between positive and negative patients treated with docetaxel chemotherapy (n ¼ 34), which complicates the
interpretation of these data, suggesting that this marker

3889

Review Article

possibly could have a prognostic component, in addition
to a predictive effect.81
A different strategy is the analysis of a defined panel
of biomarkers in serum, rather than a proteomic
approach. Byers et al82 and Ferris et al83 have analyzed
defined panels of cytokines and angiogenic factors by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum from
patients with locally advanced SCCHN treated with
induction 5-fluorouracil or docetaxel/cisplatin plus cetuximab. In both studies, marker signatures including vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 6 were
identified that appeared to correlate with progressive disease or recurrence. Follow-up studies could confirm if this
effect allows for prognostic stratification, or is predictive
of specific treatment benefits.
Conclusions
There are a growing number of molecular markers that
may potentially be used as either prognostic or predictive
tools in the treatment of SCCHN (Table 3). In particular,
2 factors—ERCC1 and HPV—have been studied extensively and have produced consistent results in both
SCCHN and other types of cancer. Pending further clinical study, these factors are likely to soon alter how we
select treatment for patients with SCCHN.
With regard to other potential markers, however, it
is becoming increasingly apparent that what is relevant in
1 type of cancer may not necessarily apply to others. Despite their importance in colorectal cancer, K-RAS mutations, for example, do not appear to play any role in
SCCHN, and routine testing for K-RAS mutations in
SCCHN patients is not warranted at this time. EGFR
unquestionably plays an important role in the development of SCCHN, but its usefulness as a biomarker in this
setting may depend on further refinement of testing methods and better definition of candidate abnormalities. The
cooperative groups will continue to study these and other
markers to better select the most appropriate treatment
for patients with SCCHN.
