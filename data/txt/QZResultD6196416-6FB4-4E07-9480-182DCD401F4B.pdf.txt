Abstract
The BRCA1 tumor suppressor protein heterodimerizes with its partner protein, BARD1, via the
RING domain present in both proteins. The heterodimer contains an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity
and participates in multiple cellular functions such as cell cycle control, DNA repair and
regulation of gene transcription, collectively aimed at maintaining genomic stability and tumor
suppression. Yet, the precise role of BRCA1 E3 ligase in these cellular functions is poorly
understood. We present data showing that BRCA1 ubiquitinates G2/M cell cycle proteins, cyclin
B and Cdc25C, leading to their accelerated degradation via a mechanism which is independent of
APC/C. BRCA1-dependent degradation of cyclin B and Cdc25C is reversed by proteasome
inhibitors and is enhanced following DNA damage, which may represent a possible mechanism to
prevent cyclin B and Cdc25C accumulation, a requirement for mitotic entry. Our data provides
mechanistic insight into how BRCA1 E3 ligase activity regulates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint
and thus, contributes to maintenance of genomic stability.

INTRODUCTION
Germline mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to early onset
breast and ovarian cancer and account for the majority of familial breast cancer cases. The
BRCA1 tumor suppressor is a ubiquitin E3 ligase enzyme that has been implicated in
numerous cellular processes essential for maintaining genomic integrity such as regulation
of cell cycle checkpoint control, homologous recombination and DNA repair, centrosome
amplification, transcription and chromatin dynamics [1]. However, the precise mechanism
through which BRCA1 exerts its tumor suppression function is not well understood.

The RING domain at the amino-terminus of BRCA1 protein contains an E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity [2]. BRCA1 forms a functional heterodimer with another RING –BRCT domains
containing protein, BARD1 and this interaction stabilizes both proteins and enhances their
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [3, 4]. Breast cancer-associated missense mutations at the aminoterminus of BRCA1 eliminate the ubiquitin ligase activity and abrogate the cell cycle
checkpoint function of the protein following DNA damage [5, 6].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The DNA damage response is controlled by multiple post translational modifications
including ubiquitination and sumoylation in addition to phosphorylation cascades. Several
E3 ligase entities including RNF8, RNF168, HERC2, RAD18, RNF20/40 and BRCA1/
BARD1 are recruited to DNA damage sites where they orchestrate a host of cellular
responses including cell cycle arrest and DNA repair (reviewed in[7]). For example, the
BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer is recruited by the RAP80-Abraxas complex to K63polyubiqiuitin chains at damaged sites through a tandem Ubiquitin Interactive Motif (UIM)
[8–10]. The BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer seems the most versatile of these E3 enzymes that
populate the damage sites as it can conjugate mono- and poly-ubiquitinations. To date, the
BRCA1-BARD1 complex was found capable of catalyzing mono-ubiquitination on histones
including H2A and H2AX as well as -tubulin and estrogen receptor in vitro [3, 11, 12].
Recently Zhu et al demonstrated that BRCA1 ubiquitinates H2A in vivo and this activity
contributes to heterochromatin silencing [13]. BRCA1/BARD1 also catalyzes polyubiquitination on several proteins, including CtIP, NPMB23 and itself but this ubiquitination
does not signal for protein degradation [14,15–17]. BRCA1 was reported to polyubiquitinate several components of the transcriptional machinery: RPB1, RPB8, TFIIE [17–
19] and the hormonally-regulated transcription factor, progesterone receptor (PR) [20, 21],
suggesting that BRCA1 regulates transcription via ubiquitination. However, except for PR
the specificity of these reactions could not be confirmed. Thus, despite being the first E3
enzyme recognized at the vicinity of damaged DNA, the contribution of BRCA1-mediated
ubiquitination to the DNA damage response is still unclear.
Previously we have shown that following DNA damage, BRCA1 plays an essential role in
cell cycle arrest at the G2/M boundary at least partially via a mechanism requiring Chk1
kinase activation and down regulation of cyclin B/Cdk1 and Cdc25C [22]. Exactly how
BRCA1 down regulates these proteins that are critical for cell cycle progression into mitosis
remains to be resolved. It has been shown that missense mutations in the amino-terminus of
BRCA1 not only eliminate it’s ubiquitin ligase activity but also abrogate it’s cell cycle
checkpoint function [5, 6]. Therefore, it seems reasonable that BRCA1-dependent
ubiquitination plays a role in cell cycle checkpoint activation especially following DNA
damage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell cycle progression through the G2/M boundary involves tightly controlled spatial and
temporal regulation of cell cycle proteins expression and activity. Cdc25C phosphatase is a
mitotic inducer that is required for the activation of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 complex. Cyclin B
expression accumulates during S and G2 phases and it translocates to the nucleus to
associate with Cdk1. Both cyclin B and Cdc25C are short lived proteins whose degradation
is temporally regulated. Cyclin B levels are down regulated at metaphase during mitosis and
Cdc25C at mitotic exit. Cyclin B ubiquitination and destruction by the proteasome occurs
following the recognition of its destruction box when APC/C complexes with Cdc20 [23,
24]. Cdc25C contains a KEN box [25], an APC/C degradation signal (degron) which is
recognized by APC/C when it is complexed with Cdh1[26]. Little is known about the
mechanism by which these proteins are regulated in the context of mitotic block following
DNA damage as APC/C is inhibited and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is activated
to prevent the accumulation of the mitotic cyclin/Cdk complexes and scheduled mitosis [24].
Here we report that BRCA1 poly-ubiquitinates cyclin B and Cdc25C and targets them for

degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to prevent unscheduled mitotic entry
following DNA damage. This data contributes to our knowledge of how loss of BRCA1
enhances genomic instability in breast cancer.

RESULTS
Proteasome Inhibitors reverse BRCA1-dependent down regulation of Cyclin B and Cdc25C
We and others have shown previously that BRCA1 down regulates the expression of cyclin
B and Cdc25C [22, 27]. To determine whether BRCA1 regulates the proteolysis of cyclin B
and Cdc25C, we expressed full-length wild type BRCA1 cDNA in BRCA1-null HCC1937
cells using an adenoviral vector. Cells were treated with 10 M of the proteasome inhibitor
N-Acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN) or MG132 (data not shown) for 6h. Expression levels
of cyclin B and Cdc25C proteins decreased in HCC1937-BRCA1 cells compared to parental
HCC1937 or HCC1937-vector cells (Figure 1a). Expression levels were recovered in the
presence of proteasome inhibitor, ALLN, in BRCA1-proficient cells suggesting that BRCA1
is required for targeting cyclin B and Cdc25C degradation via the proteasome. Cdc25A
expression increased in response to ALLN, regardless of BRCA1 status (Figure 1a),
suggesting that cyclin B and Cdc25C are specific targets for BRCA1-mediated
ubiquitination, while Cdc25A degradation is proteasome-dependent but independent of
BRCA1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether the decreased levels of cyclin B and Cdc25C expression in BRCA1proficient cells is due to an increased degradation or decreased synthesis, we blocked denovo protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) and analyzed the rates of cyclin B and
Cdc25C decay. The half-life of cyclin B in HCC1937-deficient cells was longer (~3 hr) than
in HCC1937-BRCA1 cells (< 1 hr)(Figure 1b) suggesting that BRCA1 expression
destabilizes cyclin B protein. Similar analysis was carried out for Cdc25C levels and
suggested that BRCA1 also destabilizes Cdc25C, as the half-life in BRCA1 proficient cells
was approximately 2 hrs whereas it was about 3 times longer in BRCA1-deficient cells
(Figure 1b).
Consistent with BRCA1 affecting cyclin B and Cdc25C protein stability, no significant
differences were detected in mRNA expression of cyclin B and Cdc25C before and after
treatment with ALLN in HCC1937 and HCC1937-BRCA1 cells (Supplementary Figure S1
a, b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As BRCA1 is an integral and essential participant of the DNA damage response [22], we
investigated whether BRCA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of cyclin B and Cdc25C is
modulated by DNA damage. Following exposure to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR), we
observed further down-regulation of cyclin B and Cdc25C in IR-treated HCC1937-BRCA1
cells which was blocked by the pre-treatment with proteasome inhibitor (Figure 1c and
supplementary Figure S2a). The ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, Hydroxyurea (HU) that
causes replication arrest in a BRCA1-dependent context, also promoted a further decline of
cyclin B and Cdc25C protein levels in HCC1937-BRCA1 cells relative to HCC1937-vector
and control cells that was completely blocked by proteasomal inhibition (Supplementary
Figure S2b). Thus, cyclin B and Cdc25C proteasomal degradation is enhanced in response to
DNA damage in a BRCA1-dependent manner. To determine whether down regulation of
cyclin B and Cdc25C is mediated via BRCA1-activation of Chk1, BRCA1-deficient and
proficient HCC1937 cells were treated with IR alone or in the presence of Chk1 inhibitor,
UCN-01. Chk1 inhibition did not alleviate cyclin B decreased expression following DNA
damage, suggesting that Chk1 kinase regulates the activity of cyclin B/Cdk1 complex but
not its expression (Figure 1d). Cell cycle analysis showed accumulation of BRCA1expressing cells at the G2/M phase only 20–24 hrs following IR while no significant

differences in cell cycle distribution were seen at the earlier time point of 6 hrs post IR
(Figure 1e). Thus, BRCA1-dependent proteasomal degradation of cyclin B and Cdc25C
precede the subsequent BRCA1-dependent cell cycle arrest.
Cyclin B and Cdc25C are spatially regulated and shuttle between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus in a cell cycle dependent manner. In HCC1937-BRCA1 cells, in about 40% of cells
(supplementary Figure 4), Cdc25C is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm especially
following IR [22]. This differential distribution of Cdc25C partially reflects the action of
14-3-3 which shuttles Cdc25C in a BRCA1-regulated manner [28]. Here we show (Figure
1f) that proteasomal inhibition reversed the distinct distribution pattern of Cdc25C in
BRCA1-proficient cells in which it was excluded form the nucleus of about 85% of the
cells. Cyclin B exhibits a similar cellular distribution to Cdc25C. Treatment with ALLN 1 hr
prior to IR prevented such exclusion and Cdc25C and cyclin B were localized in the
cytoplasm and the nucleus of naive and irradiated HCC1937-BRCA1 cells. (Figure 1f and
supplementary Figure S3). Thus, in addition to nuclear export, BRCA1 may target Cdc25C
and cyclin B for degradation via the nuclear proteasome and this activity is enhanced
following DNA damage.
BRCA1 knockdown stabilizes Cyclin B and Cdc25C

To expand our studies, we silenced BRCA1 expression in the breast cancer cell lines MCF7
and BT474 using a specific shRNA-BRCA1 expression vector. Cyclin B expression levels
increased in BRCA1-silenced cells (Figure 2a and supplementary S4) and were comparable
to protein levels detected in BRCA1-proficient cells treated with ALLN. Cdc25C protein
levels also increased in BRCA1-silenced MCF7 cells compared to the levels seen in MCF7
cells (Figure 2a). In response to IR, cyclin B and Cdc25C were down regulated in BRCA1proficient MCF7 cells but no significant changes were noted in BRCA1-silenced cells
(Figure 2a). Treatment of cells with CHX for varying times indicated that cyclin B half-life
is longer in BRCA1-silenced MCF7 cells than in BRCA1-proficient MCF7 cells and this
stabilization may account for the increased levels of cyclin B expression in BRCA1-silenced
cells (Figure 2b). Cell cycle analysis showed that BRCA1 silencing does not affect overall
cell cycle distribution under steady state conditions (Figure 2c). Following IR, controlMCF7 cells displayed a 2 fold increase in the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, whereas
the cellular distribution of BRCA1-silenced cells was similar to non-IR treated cells with
only a modest increase in G2/M phase cells (Figure 2c). To determine whether proteasomal
inhibition will affect mitotic entry differently in BRCA1-proficient and deficient cells we
analyzed the percent of mitotic cells with anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody and propidium
idodide staining. BRCA1-silenced MCF7 cells exhibited no change in the fraction of cells in
M-phase in cells exposed or not to IR (Figure 2d), which is consistent with the cell cycle
analysis data (Figure 2c). MCF7-control cells displayed a > 2 fold reduction in the fraction
of cells in M-phase following IR, an effect that was completely blocked by proteasomal
inhibition (Figure 2d and supplementary Figure S6). Colony survival assay shows that
MCF7 cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor are more sensitive to IR than untreated
cells (Figure 2e) unlike BRCA1-silenced MCF7 cells where proteasome inhibitor did not
significantly render them more sensitive to radiation (Figure 2e). To determine whether reexpression of BRCA1 in BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 and MCF7-shBRCA1 can rescue cell
viability and promote cell survival in response to IR, we carried out an XTT assay and found
that shRNA resistant wild type BRCA1 can rescue cell survival but the shRNA-resistant
ubiquitination mutants of BRCA1: I26A, and the RING domain mutant C61G were unable
to do so (Figure 2f). Collectively, this data shows that BRCA1 E3 ligase activity contributes
to a radiation-resistant phenotype.

The RING and the BRCT domains are required for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity towards
cell cycle proteins

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify the significance of specific BRCA1 functional domains, namely whether the
BRCT and/or the serine/threonine phosphorylation cluster (SCD) domains of BRCA1
cooperate with its RING domain in mediating cyclin B and Cdc25C protein degradation, we
expressed YFP-tagged fusion constructs linked to the amino-terminus RING domain (1–304
aa fragment, N304) alone or together with the core BRCT domain (aa 1620–1862, C243) or
with part of the SCD and BRCT (aa 1470–1862, C393) (Gift of B. Henderson; Figure 3a).
Cells expressing the two latter recombinant proteins displayed efficient cell cycle response
to IR like wild-type full length BRCA1[29, 30]. Cdc25C expression was down regulated and
stabilized following treatment with ALLN only in cells expressing the RING-SCD-BRCT
polypeptide, as in HCC1937-BRCA1 cells (Figure 3b). The RING domain alone and the
RING-BRCT (C243) were not sufficient to modulate Cdc25C expression. Similarly, the
RING-SCD-BRCT polypeptide of BRCA1 was most efficient in modulating cyclin B
expression, although the RING-BRCT polypeptide showed some activity as well (Figure
3b). Next, we examined whether DNA damage will increase the activity of the BRCA1
recombinant polypeptides, especially of the peptide that contains the SCD region with
damaged-induced phosphorylation sites that previously were implicated with BRCA1 cell
cycle function [31]. Results presented in Figure 3c show that cyclin B and Cdc25C were upregulated in cells that express the RING-SCD-BRCT polypeptide while modestly upregulated in cells that express the RING-BRCT following IR and ALLN treatment.
Interestingly, we noticed that recombinant BRCA1 levels decreased in the presence of the
proteasome inhibitor, especially following IR. We considered that BRCA1 polypeptides are
either degraded by a proteasome-independent mechanism or alternatively, heavily modified
by ubiquitination (self autoubiquitination or by another E3 ligase) to cause their
sedimentation. Analysis of the insoluble complexes in cell pellets revealed increased levels
of recombinant BRCA1 polypeptides in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, suggesting that
BRCA1 is heavily modified and might be mislocalized in the cells (Supplementary Figure
S7).
BRCA1 mediates cyclin B and Cdc25C ubiquitination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm that BRCA1 promotes ubiquitination of cyclin B and Cdc25C in cells,
ubiquitinated cyclin B was detected by immuneprecipitation followed by two parallel
immunoblots probed with either an antibody directed against ubiquitin or an antibody
against cyclin B. Characteristic poly-ubiquitin laddering was detected in BRCA1-proficient
cells that were treated with proteasome inhibitor (Figure 4a upper panel). A similar
laddering pattern was observed for cyclin B (Figure 4a lower panel). To determine if cyclin
B ubiquitination is enhanced in response to DNA damage we repeated the experiment in
cells that were treated with ALLN and exposed to IR (Figure 4b). Increased levels of
ubiquitin-conjugated cyclin B were detected in IR-treated HCC1937-BRCA1 cells but not in
HCC1937 control cells (Figure 4b). The dramatic increase in the intensity of poly-ubiquitin
banding in ALLN-treated BRCA1-expressing cells suggest that some of the BRCA1mediated ubiquitination following DNA damage is regulated by proteasomal degradation.
To verify the role of BRCA1 in de-novo poly-ubiquitination of cyclin B, BRCA1-proficient
and silenced MCF7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin. The appearance of
newly formed HA-ubiquitin chains on cyclin B was detected by immunoprecipitation of
cyclin B followed by immunoblot using an antibody against the HA-tag. In the absence of
BRCA1 expression, there was no efficient polyubiquitination of cyclin B (Figure 4c). To
date, conjugation via lys6 (K6) was mostly reported in the context of BRCA1-mediated in
vivo polyubiquitination [15, 16, 32]. Here we show that BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitination of
cyclin B does not occur via K6 ubiquitin chain assembly as no polyubiquitination can be

observed when a mutant K6 only HA-Ub (gift of T. Ohta) was transfected into MCF7 cells
(Figure 4c).

Given the rapid and transient nature of ubiquitination reactions and the fact that BRCA1 is
part of a single RING family of E3 ligases that only facilitates the transfer of activated
ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to its substrate, we cross-linked proteins in cells treated with
ALLN and with the radiomimetic drug Neocarzinostatin (NCS) and carried out an
immunoprecipitation of BRCA1 that was followed by immunoblots with antibodies to cyclin
B or BRCA1. We found an association between cyclin B and BRCA1 in untreated cells that
increases in response to DNA damage (Figure 4d). The extracts that were depleted of
BRCA1 by the immunoprecipitation showed no residual cyclin B (Figure 4d).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we carried out cell-free ubiquitination reactions combining immunoprecipitated
BRCA1 from BRCA1-proficient HCC1937 cells, purified recombinant his-tagged cyclin B
or his-tagged Cdc25C as substrates and recombinant E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, E2
ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UbcH5c) and HA-ubiquitin. An extract of HCC1937-vector
cells was pre-incubated with anti-BRCA1 antibody and was utilized as a negative control.
The level of ubiquitination was determined by immuneblotting with an anti-HA antibody.
Data in Figure 4e shows that Cdc25C was poly-ubiquitinated with HA-ubiquitin chains only
when all reaction components were included. Ubiquitination of Cdc25C was not detected in
the absence of recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes, BRCA1 or when the substrate was not
included (Figure 4e). Moreover, prior exposure of HCC1937-BRCA1 cells to IR enhanced
BRCA1-mediated Cdc25C poly-ubiquitination (Figure 4e). To confirm the
polyubiquitination of Cdc25C, we re-probed the membrane with anti-Cdc25C antibody. A
strong correlation is observed between the HA and the Cdc25C ubiquitination pattern,
further supporting de-novo ubiquitination of Cdc25C by BRCA1. The presence of equal
amounts of BRCA1 and BARD1 in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblot
analyses using anti-BRCA1 antibody (Figure 4e) and anti-BARD1 antibody (Figure 4e). In a
similar cell-free assay cyclin B is poly-ubiquitinated with HA-ubiquitin chains only when all
reaction components are assembled together. In the absence of either wild type BRCA1, E1
or E2 (UbcH5c), cyclin B is not ubiquitinated efficiently (Figure 5a). DNA damage
enhances cyclin B poly-ubiquitination (Figure 5a). Together these results support the
hypothesis that BRCA1 is required for ubiquitination of cyclin B and Cdc25C and
polyubiquitination is enhanced following exposure to IR and HU in BRCA1-proficient cells
only. BRCA1 was shown to be modified by both phosphorylation and sumoylation in
response to DNA damage, thus it is feasible that these modifications enhance its activity.
BRCA1 collaborates with UbcH1 to ubiquitinate cyclin B

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BRCA1 has been shown to interact with 10 different E2 activating enzymes which catalyze
variety of chain topologies. Of those enzyme few were found to productively collaborate
with BRCA1 in its auto-ubiquitination [33]. To determine which E2 collaborates with
BRCA1 in promoting cyclin B ubiquitination, we repeated the cell-free ubiquitination assays
as described above with the two E2s that are involved in conjugation of poly-ubiquitin
chains: UbcH1(ube2k) and MMS2-Ubc13 complex. We found that in addition to the
promiscuous E2: UbcH5c, UbcH1, which catalyzes K48 chains, was able to promote
BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of cyclin B that is enhanced following exposure to DNA
damage. On the other hand, MMS2-UbcH13 complex which catalyzes K63 chains was able
to promote ubiquitination in a BRCA1-independent manner (Figure 5a, b and c). To verify
that cyclin B ubiquitination is mediated by BRCA1 and UbcH1, we silenced UbcH1
expression in wild type and BRCA-deficient MCF-7 cells and analyzed whether cyclin B
could be ubiquitinated in response to IR. Results presented in Figure 5d show that cyclin B
ubiquitination increased only in cells that express BRCA1 and UbcH1 whereas levels of
cyclin B ubiquitination were reduced in UbcH1 or BRCA1 silenced cells (Figure 5d). These

results suggest that BRCA1 targets Cyclin B to the proteasome via the canonical
ubiquitination pathway. As a control we analyzed the ubiquitination levels of histone H2A
and found that although levels are slightly reduced in BRCA1-silenced cells, IR or
proteasome inhibitor had almost no effect in either BRCA1-proficient or silenced cells,
while the combination of treatments caused slight decrease in ubiquitinated H2A. Silencing
of UbcH1 also had very little effect on levels of ubiquitylated H2A (Fig. 5d–f).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further demonstrate that BRCA1 directly ubiquitinates cyclin B, we reconstituted in vitro
ubiquitination reactions with purified recombinant BRCA1 RING domain and full length of
BARD1 as the only source of an E3 ligase activity. As a control substrate we used a purified
histone fraction. Results shown in Figure 5e suggest that the greatest extent of cyclin B
poly-ubiquitination occurs in vitro only when all reaction components are present and not
when E1, E2 (UbcH5c), cyclin B or BRCA1 are missing. Furthermore, the BRCA1 mutant
C61G does not support cyclin B ubiquitination in vitro. Here again, we assayed several of
the E2 enzymes including UbcH1, UbcH10 and UbcH13-MMS2. Both UbcH1 and UbcH10
can catalyze K48 poly-ubiquitin chains but the latter does not interact with BRCA1. No
ubiquitination was detected with UbcH13-MMS2 complex (data not shown) and no specific
cyclin B ubiquitination was seen with UbcH10 (Figure. 5g). Cyclin B ubiquitination was
detected with both UbcH5c and UbcH1. While UbcH5c ubiquitinates histone proteins the
reaction with UbcH1 appears to be more specific to BRCA1., Together, our data suggestg
that BRCA1-dependent ubiquitination of cyclin B and H2A are modulated by two
independent mechanisms even in response to DNA damage.
The topology of ubiquitin linkage catalyzed on cyclin B was elucidated by excision of in
vitro-ubiquitinated cyclin B band from an SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel tryptic digestion
and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. Along with the ubiquitinated
peptides originated from cyclin B identifying its acceptor sites (Supplementary Table 1), two
“signature” ubiquitinated peptides of ubiquitin incorporating lysine residues at positions 48
and 33 were located by their mass shifts in both MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS analyses and
using Mascot database (Supplementary table 2).
BRCA1 ubiquitnates Cyclin B independent of the Cyclosome APC/C

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Both cyclin B and Cdc25C are known degradable substrates of the cyclosome APC/C.
Cyclin B ubiquitination by APC/Cdc20 facilitates its proteasomal degradation during
metaphase while Cdc25C ubiquitination is mediated by APC/Cdh1 upon mitotic exit. We
expressed wild type and APC/C resistant cyclin B (destruction box (D-box)-mutant, gift of
M. Brandeis [34]) in BRCA1-deficient and proficient HCC1937 cells (Figure 6a). We show
by immunoblot analysis that wild type cyclin B expression is down regulated in cells
proficient for BRCA1 compared to BRCA1-deficient background. Interestingly the
expression of the APC/C non-degradable cyclin B mutant substrate expression was downregulated in BRCA1-proficient cells (Figure 6a), implying that BRCA1 targets cyclin B to
the proteasome independently of APC/C.
To assess the contribution of specific lysine residues that were identified as BRCA1dependent cyclin B acceptor sites to cell cycle arrest following IR, we have generated
mutant cyclin B constructs in which lysine residues were replaced by arginine residues.
Wild type and mutant cyclin B recombinant proteins were ectopically expressed together
with wildtype BRCA1 and transfected HCC1937 cells were exposed to 10 Gy of IR.
Expression of cyclin B proteins caused accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle (Figure 6b). In response to IR, additional accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase was
observed for wild type cyclin B expressing cells. However, mutant cyclin B proteins in
which lysine residues 16 and 18 (K16, K18) or lysine 63, lysine 64 (K63, K64) and or lysine
67 (K64, K67) were mutated and thus cannot be ubiquitinated did not support any further

accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Thus, expression of mutant cyclin
B enabled the cells to bypass the G2/M checkpoint regardless of the presence of wild type
BRCA1 (Figure 6b). In contrast, mutations of lysine residues 51 and 59 (K51, K59) did not
impair the accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase following DNA damage. Taken together,
lysine residues K16, K18, K63, K64 and K67 in cyclin B seem to play an important role in
BRCA1-mediated cell cycle arrest.
MAD2, is a pivotal component of the spindle assembly checkpoint [24]. MAD2 inhibits
APC/Cdc20-dependent degradation (including cyclin B) prior to mitosis in order to prevent
chromosome missegregation [35]. Our results indicate that BRCA1 up-regulates MAD2
mRNA and protein expression especially following exposure to IR (Figure 6c and d). In
addition we found that BRCA1 up regulates another spindle assembly checkpoint protein:
the deubiquitinating enzyme, USP44 (Figure 6e). USP44 deubiquitinates Cdc20 and enables
the stabilization of the inactive complex MAD2-CDC20-APC/C [36]. Taken together, our
results show that BRCA1 modulates the expression of at least two spindle assembly
checkpoint members (MAD2 and USP44) in addition to ubiquitinating Cdc25C and cyclin B
and targeting them for proteasomal degradation (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BRCA1 was the first E3 ligase identified at sites of DSB following DNA damage. Yet, the
current list of BRCA1 ubiquitinated substrates does not provide many clues as to how
BRCA1 E3 ligase activity contributes to cellular responses following DNA insults. Here we
show that BRCA1 promotes poly-ubiquitination and degradation of two essential cell cycle
proteins critical for the transition of cells from the G2 phase to the M phase: cyclin B and
Cdc25C, via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway especially following DNA damage. Our
data offers a mechanistic insight into the role of BRCA E3 ligase in preventing unscheduled
mitotic entry (the uncoupling between DNA repair completion and mitosis) and maintenance
of genome stability.

The limiting step for cell cycle transition into mitosis is the activation of the cyclin B/Cdk1
complex. The temporal cyclin B-Cdk1 complex formation is tightly regulated by several
cellular mechanisms including inhibition of cyclin B1 transcription [37], spatial control of
cyclin B1-Cdk1 and Cdc25B/C [38] [39], and targeted Cdc25C destruction [25, 27]. Here
we show that BRCA1 is critical for cyclin B and Cdc25C ubiqutination and accelerated
turnover. While, previously we reported that BRCA1 activates Chk1 kinase, an upstream
inhibitor of cyclin B/Cdk1 and Cdc25C following DNA damage, here we show that BRCA1
down regulates cyclin B expression even in the presence of Chk1 inhibition with UCN-01,
inferring to multiple levels of cell cycle regulation by BRCA1 which regulate cyclin B and
Cdc25C expression and activity by direct and indirect mechanisms. Interestingly, an inverse
correlation between BRCA1 and cyclin B expression was noted in tumors [40].
We found that the RING finger together with the C-terminus BRCT domain and the adjacent
phosphorylation sites are required for efficient ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin B
and Cdc25C via the proteasome. These domains were shown to be important for IR-induced
foci and G2/M checkpoint activation [29]. In vitro the RING domain was sufficient to
promote cyclin B ubiquitination similarly to an observation for which the C-terminus of
BRCA1 was dispensable for in vitro ubiquitination of RNA Polymerase II [18]. The
requirement for the C-terminal BRCT domain in the cells, may suggest that in the complex
environment of the nucleus, DNA-damaged induced post-translational modifications of
BRCA1 such as phosphosrylation and sumoylation [4, 41] may activate its E3 ligase activity
either by altering the protein conformation of by or facilitating its binding with its substrates.

Our data suggest that the ubiquitination function of BRCA1 at the amino-terminus is
required to protect cells from DNA damaged induced cell death, since over-expression of
two BRCA1 ubiquitination defective mutants (I26A and C61G) decrease cell survival
compared with over expression of wild type BRCA1. Yet recently it was reported that I26A
mutation has limited phenotypic effect in murine models and is dispensable for DNA repair
[42] [43]. In contrast, a recent report by Zhu et al [13] demonstrated that BRCA1-mediated
ubiquitination of H2A is critical for heterochromatin silencing and maintenance of genomic
stability while the I26A mutant failed to support this activity. The basis for the discrepancies
is unclear and could result from the different model systems used in the different studies
especially considering that murine models of BRCA1 require two allelic deletions and loss
of p53 to induce tumor formation [44, 45]. Thus, it is possible that murine cells have
additional protective mechanisms to suppress genomic instability when Brca1 is mutated. In
further support of cyclin B as a physiological substrate of BRCA1 and the importance of this
mechanism for maintenance of genomic stability we show that overexpression of specific
cyclin B ubiquitination mutants allow IR-treated BRCA1-proficient cells to bypass the G2/
M checkpoint with cell cycle distribution similar to non-damaged cells or BRCA1-deficient
cells. Interestingly, we identified K63 and K64 as are part of a SUMO consensus binding
site in cyclin B which may explain why mutations of these residues will abrogate BRCA1
activity, as data from our lab indicate that sumoylation of cyclin B precedes its
ubiquitination (manuscript in preparation).

The chemical nature of the ubiquitin linkage catalyzed by the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is
another point of contention. Mono-ubiquitination substrates include the histone proteins
H2A and H2AX, -tubulin and ER- [3, 11, 12, 46, 47]. The BRCA1/BARD1 complex can
also catalyze and assemble polyubiquitin chains through Lys 6 (K6) [16] [30] and Lys48
(K48) and Lys63 (K63) [4]. Poly-autoubiquitination stabilizes the BRCA1/BARD1 complex
and enhances its poly-ubiquitination. BRCA1 poly-ubiquitinates the G2/M-related proteins
NPM/B23[16] and CtIP [30] via the unconventional Lys6 chains, and these substrates are
not targeted for proteasomal degradation. Hence it is difficult to assess the contribution of
Lys6 assembled chains to the DNA damage response. The versatility of BRCA1 in
promoting multiple types of ubiquitin linkage is not unique and additional E3 ligase
enzymes have similar capabilities. For example Parkin, a RING E3 ligase catalyzes K48 and
K63 links [48]. APC/C was shown to catalyze mono-Ub, K-63 linked, K-11-linked and
K-48 linked ubiquitin chains all on one substrate: cyclin B. Interestingly all modifications
signaled for proteasomal degradation with similar kinetics even in the absence of K-48
linked ubiquitination [49].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS analysis revealed that BRCA1-mediated ubiquitin chain
assembly via K48 or K33 on cyclin B rather than K6. As different E2 enzymes can direct
BRCA1 to catalyze different types of ubiquitin chains [33], we assessed the ability of four
different E2 enzymes (UbcH5c, UbcH1, Ubc13-MMS2 and UbcH10) to support BRCA1dependent cyclin B ubiquitination. In addition to the promiscuous E2, UbcH5c, that supports
assembly of both mono and several types of poly-ubiquitin chains, UbcH1 which promotes
K48 polyubiquitin chain assembly supported BRCA1-mediated cyclin B polyubiquitination. Furthermore, silencing of UbcH1 diminished BRCA1-dependent
ubiquitination of cyclin B but did not affect H2A ubiquitination. Not surprisingly, UbcH10
which support K48 chains assembly but does not bind BRCA1 did not support BRCA1dependent cyclin B ubiquitination [33].
In summary, this study shows that BRCA1 binds to and ubiquitinates cyclin B and Cdc25C
and targets them for degradation, a function which is enhanced in response to DNA damage.
Mutant BRCA1 and mutant cyclin B proteins abrogate these interactions and fail to prevent
unscheduled mitotic entry and fail to support proper cell cycle regulation. BRCA1 also

modulates the expression of at least two spindle assembly checkpoint proteins (MAD2 and
USP44) and therefore adopts a multi-modal approach to bring about G2 arrest in response to
DNA damage. This study is the first to demonstrate the importance of BRCA1-dependent
cyclin B and Cdc25C ubiquitination in DNA damage induced G2 arrest and may provide an
insights not only to mechanisms that are responsible for tumor prevention but also for how
tumor cells may escape therapy.

a) BRCA1-mediates ubiquitination of Cyclin B. HCC1937, HCC1937-vector and HCC1937BRCA1 cells were treated with 10 M ALLN for 6 h. Ubiquitination of endogenous Cyclin
B was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against Cyclin B
followed by immunoblot with a monoclonal antibody against Cyclin B (lower panel) or by
immunoblot with a monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin (upper panel).
b) DNA damage enhances cyclin B ubiquitination. HCC1937-vector and HCC1937-BRCA1
cells were treated with ALLN and then exposed to 10 Gy of IR. After recovery of 6 hr,
ubiquitination of cyclin B was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with cyclin B antibody
followed by immunoblot with a monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin.
c) BRCA1 expression is necessary for cyclin B poly-ubiquitination following DNA damage.
BRCA1-silenced MCF7 cells (lower panel) and BRCA1 expressing MCF7 cells (upper
panel) were transfected with wild type HA-ubiquitin (left panels) or Mutant HA-ubiquitin
with K6 only (right panels). On the following day, cells were treated with ALLN as
described and some cells were exposed to 10 Gy IR or 2mM HU. Detection of HA-ubiquitin
chains on cyclin B was carried by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against
Cyclin B followed by immunoblot with a monoclonal antibody against HA-tag.
d) DNA damage enhances the association between BRCA1 and cyclin B. MCF7 cells were
treated with ALLN and 120 ng/ml of the radiomimetic drug, Neocarzinostatin (NCS), for 4
hr. Proteins were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min before the reaction was
stopped. Cells were lysed and the association between BRCA1 and cyclin B was analyzed
by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody against BRCA1 followed by
immunoblot with a polyclonal antibody against cyclin B or a monoclonal antibody against
BRCA1. Recombinant his-tagged- cyclin B purified from bacterial extract was used as a
control. Normal mouse IgG (NMIgG) was used as a negative control. Input represents total
cell lysates and depleted lanes represent a fraction of the proteins that were not precipitated
with the antibody against BRCA1.
e) BRCA1 polyubiquitinates Cdc25C in cell free extracts. BRCA1 was immunoprecipitated
from HCC1937-BRCA1 cell lysates. Following extensive washing, the precipitate was
incubated in 30 l ubiquitination reaction buffer together with purified His-Cdc25C, HAUb, E1, E2 (UbcH5c) and ATP. Immunoprecipitation with anti-BRCA1 antibody of
HCC1937 cell lysate was used as a negative control. Following 1 hr incubation, reaction mix
were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunblotted with anti-HA antibody or with anti-Cdc25C
antibody. Amounts of BRCA1 and BARD1 in these lysates were detected with their
corresponding antibodies (lower panels).

Model of BRCA1 action as an E3 ubiquitin ligase following DNA damage. BRCA1
ubiquitinates cyclin B and Cdc25C and prevents mitotic entry. At the same time BRCA1
induces MAD2 that inhibits APC/C that usually ubiquitinates cyclin B and Cdc25C at the
mitotic exit.
