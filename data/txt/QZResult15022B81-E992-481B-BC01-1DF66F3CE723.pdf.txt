Abstract
Our previous findings indicated that RSK2 plays a critical role
in proliferation and cell transformation induced by tumor
promoters, such as epidermal growth factor or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and that kaempferol, a natural
compound found in edible plants, selectively inhibits RSK2
activity. However, the molecular mechanism for RSK2 activation is unclear. Herein, we provide evidence showing that
NH2-terminal kinase domain (NTD) activation of RSK2 is
required for the activation of the extracellular signalregulated kinase–mediated COOH-terminal kinase domain
(CTD). We also found that the NTD plays a key role in
substrate phosphorylation and that kaempferol binds with
the NTD but not the CTD in both the active and inactive
forms. Homology modeling of the RSK2 NH2-terminal domain
and small-molecule docking, validated by mutagenesis
experiments, clearly showed that Val82 and Lys100 are critical
amino acids for kaempferol binding and RSK2 activity.
Furthermore, immunohistofluorescence and Western blot
results indicated that the RSK2 protein level is markedly
higher in cancer cell lines as well as cancer tissues compared
with nonmalignant cell lines or normal tissues. In addition,
kaempferol inhibited proliferation of malignant human
cancer cell lines, including A431, SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28,
and HCT-116. These results indicate that targeting RSK2
with natural compounds, such as kaempferol, might be a good
strategy for chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic application. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4398–406]

Introduction
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are important
regulators of proliferation and oncogenesis (1, 2). The MAPK
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 (3, 4) mediate
the phosphorylation of 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK), which
are a family of widely expressed serine/threonine kinases that
respond to many growth factors, peptide hormones, and neurotransmitters (5, 6). RSK2 is a member of the p90RSK family and is
activated by ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1
(3, 4). When activated, RSK2 is translocated to the nucleus, where it
can phosphorylate various nuclear proteins, including c-Fos, Elk-1,
histones, cyclic AMP–responsive element binding (CREB) protein
(7–11), activating transcription factor 4 (12), p53 (13), and NFAT3
(14). Based on its broad substrate specificity, the RSK2 protein

is likely to mediate a variety of cellular processes, including
proliferation and transformation as well as cell cycle.
The Ras/ERK pathway regulates cell proliferation, survival,
growth and motility (15, 16), and tumorigenesis (17). RSK2 is a
direct substrate kinase of ERKs and is located between ERKs and
its own target transcription factors. Therefore, RSK2 is an
important direct effector for transcriptional activation of downstream target transcription factors. RSK2 phosphorylates and
inactivates the proapoptotic protein BAD, a component of the cell
death machinery, and RSK2 also up-regulates the transcription of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 through CREB phosphorylation and activation
(18). Because apoptosis is presumed to have a protective function
against carcinogenesis, these effects suggest that RSK2 may have
a role in enhancing tumorigenesis. Furthermore, a recent report
indicated that RSK2 is involved in prostate cancer cell proliferation
(19) and in c-fos–dependent osteosarcoma development (20).
Therefore, deciphering the molecular activation mechanism of
RSK2 substrate phosphorylation and the mechanism of selective
RSK2 inhibition is extremely important for understanding how
to control RSK2 activity.
Recently, SL0101, the rhamnose form of kaempferol extracted
from the tropical plant Forsteronia refracta, was shown to inhibit
RSK2 activity and suppress proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells or LNCaP prostate cancer cells (19, 21). We found that
kaempferol selectively inhibited RSK2, but not RSK1 or RSK3, and
this compound suppressed proliferation and cell transformation
induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; ref. 22). A homology model of the NH2terminal kinase domain (NTD) RSK2 was the starting point for
examining the docking of SL0101 or kaempferol in the protein
ATP-binding pocket of RSK2 and suggested that both SL0101 and
kaempferol could form good interactions with NTD RSK2 (23).
Most recently, the inactive structure of NTD RSK1 at 1.9 Å
resolution (24) was reported and the structure showed a 95%
amino acid sequence identity with NTD RSK2. However, although
accumulating results indicate that RSK2 plays an important role in
cell proliferation and cancer development, the actual mechanism
of activation and inhibition of RSK2 activity and the effect on its
substrate(s) is not yet clearly understood.
In the present study, we found that the RSK2 protein level was
obviously higher in malignant cancer cell lines and human cancer
tissues compared with normal cells and tissues. Furthermore,
we showed that the NTD RSK2 is a critical kinase domain for
substrate phosphorylation, which requires ERK-mediated activation. We found that kaempferol binds and suppresses the
activation of NTD RSK and that Val82 and Lys100 are critical amino
acids for NTD RSK2 activity and inhibition by kaempferol resulted
in decreased cell proliferation.

RSK2 NH2-Terminal Kinase Activity
In vitro kinase assay. A GST-NFAT3D4-261-365 protein was used as a
substrate for an in vitro kinase assay with RSK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc)
and bacterial-expressed His-RSK2 was used for an in vitro kinase assay with
active ERK1, ERK2, p38a, or p38h. Reactions were carried out at 30jC for
30 min in a mixture containing 50 Amol/L unlabeled ATP and 10 ACi
[g-32P]ATP and then were stopped by adding 6 SDS sample buffer. To test
the effect of kaempferol on RSK2 activity, we used 10 Amol/L unlabeled ATP
and 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP. Samples were boiled and then separated by 12%
SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography, Western blotting, or
Coomassie blue staining.
Pull-down assay with CNBr-kaempferol beads. Kaempferol was first
coupled to a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix, and the binding between
RSK2 and kaempferol was examined by affinity chromatography according
to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. The active or bacterial-expressed
RSK2 protein (100 ng) was tested for affinity binding with 30 AL of CNBrkaempferol beads (50% slurry) by incubating for 2 h at 4jC. The beads were
washed thrice and suspended in 20 AL of 1 SDS sample buffer. Bound
proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blot
using specific antibodies.
Tissue array. A human skin tissue array (SK801) was purchased from
U.S. Biomax, Inc., and analysis was conducted according to the
manufacturer’s suggested protocols. The tissue array includes matched

normal tissues (H1-H7), which were biopsied from the adjacent tissue of
each cancer tissue (A1-A7) from seven individual patients. The slide was
baked at 60jC for 2 h, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Antigens were then
unmasked by submerging the slide into boiling sodium citrate buffer
(10 mmol/L; pH 6.0) for 10 min. The sample was blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin in 1 PBS/0.03% Triton X-100 in a humidified chamber for
1 h at room temperature, and then the RSK2 antibody (1:200 dilution in
1 PBS/0.03% Triton X-100) at 4jC in a humidified chamber overnight.
The slide was washed and hybridized with the secondary antibody (antirabbit, donkey antibody) conjugated with Cy3 (1:1,000) for 1.5 h at room
temperature in the dark.

studies indicated that RSK2 plays a critical role in skeletal muscle
cell differentiation through its activation of NFAT3 in C2C12
myoblasts (14) and in cell proliferation and transformation
induced by tumor promoters such as EGF or TPA through its
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (22). We also found that

plants, is a natural compound that specifically inhibits RSK2
activity, resulting in suppression of cell transformation as well as
decreased histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 (22). However, the
action and inhibitory mechanisms of kaempferol on RSK2 are
not yet clear. To achieve a greater understanding, we

RSK2 NH2-Terminal Kinase Activity

results indicated that full activation of RSK2 requires upstream
kinase-mediated activation such as ERKs.
ERKs, but not p38, activate RSK2. Our previous study
indicated that PD98059, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor,
and SB202190, a p38 inhibitor, blocked histone H3 phosphorylation
(25). RSK2 is an upstream kinase of histone H3 (Ser10; ref. 22).
However, whether the only upstream kinase of RSK2 is ERK is
unclear. To examine this idea, we conducted an in vitro kinase
assay with bacterial-expressed His-RSK2-1-740 and identical units
of active ERK1, ERK2, p38a, or p38h and [g-32P]ATP. The results
indicated that ERK1 or ERK2 strongly phosphorylated RSK2
(Fig. 2A) but not p38a or p38h (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we
determined that ERKs phosphorylated the linker region and the
COOH-terminal region of RSK2 (Fig. 2B). Next, to determine RSK2
domain responsible for substrate phosphorylation, individual
purified RSK2 proteins were subjected to a primary kinase reaction
with active ERK2 and [g-32P]ATP. One half of the reaction mixture
(10 AL) was used to confirm phosphorylation of the RSK2 proteins
by autoradiography (Fig. 2C). The remaining reaction mixture was
divided into 2 AL aliquots and each was used sequentially in a
secondary reaction with the substrate NFAT3-261-365. The
autoradiography results indicated that NFAT3 phosphorylation
was detected only with full-length His-RSK2-1-740 (Fig. 2D, lane 8)
and not with His-RSK2-328-740 or His-RSK2-399-740 (Fig. 2D, lanes
9 and 10). Taken together with results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, these
data indicate that substrate phosphorylation by RSK2 requires
ERK-mediated preactivation and occurs through the NTD RSK2
but not the COOH-terminal kinase domain (CTD) RSK2.
The NTD RSK2 is responsible for substrate phosphorylation
ex vivo. To examine whether the NTD RSK2 is responsible for
substrate phosphorylation under physiologic conditions, we
constructed an NTD-deleted RSK2 (RSK2-NTDD) and a CTDdeleted RSK2 (RSK2-CTDD; Fig. 3A). The vectors, including the
full-length RSK2 (RSK2 FL), were transfected into 293 cells and
expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The
proteins were immunoprecipitated with an Xpress-tagged antibody
(Fig. 3C) and directly subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with
NFAT3-261-365 and [g-32P]ATP. The results showed that RSK2-FL,
but not RSK2-NTDD or RSK2-CTDD, phosphorylated NFAT3-261365 (Fig. 3D). These results showed that the NTD is responsible
for substrate phosphorylation and NTD activation requires
activation by the CTD.
Kaempferol binds with the NTD of RSK2. Our previous study
showed that kaempferol inhibits RSK2 activity in vitro and ex vivo
(22). However, the molecular mechanism of kaempferol inhibition
of RSK2 has not been elucidated. To examine our hypothesis, we
conjugated kaempferol with CNBr-Sepharose 4B beads and
conducted an in vitro pull-down assay with an active RSK2 protein
(100 ng; Fig. 4A). The results showed that the active RSK2 protein
bound with CNBr-kaempferol beads but not with unconjugated
CNBr-control beads (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we found that
kaempferol binds with either bacterial-expressed RSK2 (inactive)
or active RSK2 (commercially available; Fig. 4B). Next, we
conducted a pull-down assay with CNBr-kaempferol beads and
each bacterial-expressed RSK2 protein (same molar ratio),
including His-RSK2-1-740, His-RSK2-1-373, His-RSK2-328-740, and
His-RSK2-399-740. Western blot results indicated that the RSK2
proteins that harbored the NTD, including His-RSK2-1-740 and HisRSK2-1-373, bound with CNBr-kaempferol beads (Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, results from a pull-down assay using CNBr-kaempferol beads and lysates from cells that overexpressed RSK2 FL, NTD

RSK2, or CTD RSK2 showed that RSK2 FL bound with kaempferol
(Fig. 4D). Unexpectedly, the CTD RSK2 did not bind to CNBrkaempferol beads, indicating that unknown factor(s) may interfere
with kaempferol and CTD RSK2 binding.
Val82 and Lys100 are required for RSK2 activity. To better
understand how small molecules such as kaempferol interact with
the catalytic site of NTD RSK2 to modulate its activity, we modeled
the NTD RSK2 (Fig. 5A) based on the crystal structure of the highly
homologous phosphorylated protein kinase C (PKC) protein in
complex with staurosporine (Protein Data Bank code: 1xjd). An
NTD RSK2 homology model based on the complex between protein
kinase A and ANP has already been reported (23). Using the
modeled NTD RSK2, we docked kaempferol or SL0101 in silico to
the ATP-binding pocket, allowing not only the ligand to be flexible
but also the amino acids forming the protein binding site to
achieve a more realistic view of the possible protein-ligand
interactions (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Both
kaempferol and SL0101 showed the capability of forming
numerous favorable connections within the NTD RSK2 ATPbinding pocket as indicated by a good docking score of 12.8 and
13.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The bound orientation of our
predicted complexes was different from a model previously
proposed (23). In our model, kaempferol seemed to form three
hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of Asp148 and Leu150 in
the hinge region of the NTD RSK2 (Fig. 5B). In contrast to the
docking pose anticipated in ref. 23, a hydrogen bond might be
formed with the amino group of the conserved Lys100 in the
phosphate region of the catalytic site (similar to many known
kinase inhibitors) and the backbone carbonyl group of Leu74. The
kaempferol heterocyclic ring system lies in the hydrophobic region
of the catalytic site in what would be the position occupied by
the ATP adenine. Kaempferol seems capable of forming numerous
favorable contacts with the upper limit of the hydrophobic area
shaped mainly by the aliphatic side chain of Val82 and the lower
area defined by Leu150 and Leu200. Similar to kaempferol, the planar
double ring of SL0101 occupies the ATP hydrophobic pocket,
although rotated by about 90j and may form several hydrogen
bonds with the catalytic pocket as well (Fig. 5B). Notably, a
mutation of Val82 to phenylalanine in the RSK2 ATP site is
associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, suggesting that Val82 plays
an important role in RSK2 activity (26). Our modeling results
indicated that kaempferol might form key interactions with Val82
and, hence, very likely affects RSK2 activity. To further examine this
hypothesis and validate our docking outcomes, we constructed
point mutants Val82Phe, Lys100Phe, or Leu147Phe in the pcDNA4RSK2 FL (Fig. 5C) and transfected these individual constructs
into 293 cells, and then an immunoprecipitation/kinase assay was
conducted with the Xpress antibody and GST-NFAT3-261-365
fragment. The results showed that the phosphorylation of
NFAT3-261-365 was significantly reduced when RSK2 Val82 or
Lys100 was mutated but only slightly reduced in the Leu147Phe
mutant. Indeed, in our homology model, Leu147 is located on the
back of the ATP-binding pocket and does not form crucial
interactions with kaempferol (Fig. 5B), which may explain why the
phosphorylation capacity is only partially affected. Furthermore,
we found that introduction of RSK2 FL induced cell proliferation,
whereas NTDD RSK2 or CTDD RSK2 transfection resulted in
suppressed cell proliferation (Fig. 5D). These results strongly
suggested that kaempferol binding to Val82 and Lys100 is critical for
its inhibition of RSK2 NH2-terminal kinase activity and cell
proliferation.

RSK2 protein level is higher in cancer tissues compared
with normal tissues. Our earlier study showed that RSK2
overexpression in JB6 Cl41 cells enhanced proliferation and
transformation induced by EGF or TPA and knockdown of RSK2
by small interfering RNA suppressed RasG12V-mediated Foci
formation in NIH3T3 cells (22). These results suggested that the
RSK2 protein level and activity might be higher in malignant
cancer cells or tissues compared with normal cells or tissues. To
examine this idea, we cultured several different malignant human
cancer cell lines and nonmalignant human and mouse cell lines
and then analyzed RSK2 protein level by Western blotting. The
results indicated that many cancer cell lines, including H460, MCF7, HCT-116, HCT-29, PC-2, Du-145, SoaS-2, A431, SK-MEL-5, SKMEL-28, and RPMI 1640 (Fig. 6A), expressed higher RSK2 protein
levels compared with nonmalignant human and mouse cells, such
as HaCaT, JB6 Cl41, and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6A). Based on these
results, we further hypothesized that kaempferol might suppress
cancer cell proliferation. To examine this idea, we analyzed the
effect of kaempferol on proliferation of various human malignant
cancer cell lines, including A431 (skin epidermoid carcinoma), SKMEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 (melanoma), and HCT-116 (colon cancer) by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. The results
indicated that kaempferol suppressed proliferation in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6B). In a human skin tissue array that
included matched normal and various skin cancer tissues, we
found by immunofluorescence assay that normal human skin,
including epidermal and basal layers, exhibited RSK2 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1, H1–H10). Notably, we found that the RSK2
protein level was elevated by an average of f2-fold in almost all of
the skin cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary
Table S1) compared with normal skin tissues (Fig. 6C). Importantly,
a statistical comparison (by ‘‘two-sample unequal variance’’
Student’s t test) of normal (9 samples) and cancer tissues (70

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

samples) indicated biological significance (P = 2.48E16; Fig. 6C).
Furthermore, in a comparison of RSK2 protein level in a tissue
array of matched human normal skin (H1–H6 in Supplementary
Fig. S1) and cancer tissues (A1–A6 in Supplementary Fig. S1), we
found that the RSK2 protein level was substantially enhanced in
skin cancer tissues (Fig. 6D, top). In a densitometric analysis of
each matched sample, the RSK2 protein level was increased by
f300% compared with normal control tissue sample (Fig. 6D,
bottom left). Moreover, statistical analysis (homoscedastic Student’s
t test) to compare RSK2 protein level in all matched human normal
and cancer tissues indicated that the difference in RSK2 expression
was significant (P < 0.001; Fig. 6D, bottom right). These results
indicated that RSK2 is highly abundant in cancer tissues compared
with normal tissues and inhibition of RSK2 by dietary compounds
such as kaempferol can suppress cancer cell proliferation.

Discussion
Flavonoids such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin,
and apigenin are well-known compounds found in edible plants.
The highest total flavonoid content is observed in onion leaves
(e.g., quercetin at 1,497.5 mg/kg, luteolin at 391.9 mg/kg, and
kaempferol at 832.0 mg/kg; ref. 27). The recently isolated
compound SL0101 [kaempferol 3-O-(300,400-di-O-acetyl-a-L-rhamnopyranoside)] was shown to inhibit RSK2 activity (IC50 = 89 nmol/L
in vitro) and suppress proliferation of MCF-7 breast and LNCaP
prostate cancer cells (19, 21). We found that kaempferol also
suppressed RSK2 activity with an IC50 of f7 Amol/L in vitro (22).
However, accumulating evidence indicates that the side chain of
some food compounds is cleaved in the intestinal flora, which
increases the absorption of that particular compound (28, 29).
Furthermore, kaempferol can be detected in human plasma (800
nmol/L) and urine after oral administration, suggesting that
kaempferol can be absorbed in the intestine (30). This evidence

RSK2 NH2-Terminal Kinase Activity

indicates that kaempferol is a major dietary flavonoid, which can
be absorbed from intestine. Recently, we found that kaempferol
selectively inhibits RSK2 activity in vitro and in vivo and also
suppresses EGF-induced anchorage-independent cell transformation through the inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10
(22). Other research groups have shown that kaempferol induces
apoptosis (31) in partially differentiated colon cancer (32),
suggesting that kaempferol might function as an anticancer agent.
Furthermore, combination treatment with kaempferol and quercetin in gut (HuTu-80 and Caco-2) and breast (PMC42) cancer cells
suppresses proliferation that is associated with a decreased
expression of nuclear proliferation antigen Ki67 (33). In this study,
we found that the RSK2 protein level was increased in many
human skin tumors, including melanoma and squamous cell
carcinoma, and chronic inflammatory fibrous tissues, and many
human cancer cell lines. By comparing the efficacy of kaempferol
in cancer cells (Fig. 6D), we found that cancer cells are more
sensitive to kaempferol compared with nonmalignant cells.
Proliferation was inhibited in JB6 cells by f15% at 15 Amol/L
and 39% at 60 Amol/L kaempferol (22). However, proliferation of
cancer cells, such as A431, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, and HCT-116,
was inhibited by kaempferol by about 24% to 27% at 25 Amol/L
and 45% to 60% at 50 Amol/L. These results clearly showed that
cancer cells, which contain a greater abundance of RSK2 protein,
are more sensitive to the effect of kaempferol on proliferation.
These findings support the importance of developing therapeutic
agents targeting RSK2 and kaempferol binding may be a good
starting point for selective drug design. However, although
kaempferol is one of the most common and abundant dietary
phytochemicals with potent chemopreventive activity against

RSK2 activity, its effect in in vivo animal models has not yet been
studied.
A published solved structure for the NTD RSK2 is not yet
available. However, a homology model based on a complex formed
between protein kinase A (PKA) and ANP has been reported (24).
We chose PKC instead of PKA as the template for building an NTD
RSK2 homology model because in the PKC X-ray structure, the
ATP-binding site is occupied by the large and flat staurosporine
(a well-known PKC inhibitor), which forces the catalytic pocket to
adopt an open conformation that is optimal for accommodating
small molecules, thus facilitating docking experiments. Very
recently, the crystal structure of the NTD RSK1 in complex with
staurosporine was solved (24). The NTD RSK1 shares a 95% amino
acid identity with the NTD RSK2. We compared the structures of
the two proteins and the root mean square deviation between our
NTD RSK2 homology model and the solved RSK1-NTD structure
was only 1.9 Å, which implies that they likely exhibit very similar
conformations. Furthermore, the staurosporine molecule presented
in both ATP-binding sites superimposes almost entirely, adopting
an identical interaction profile within the pocket, which further
validates our NTD RSK2 homology model. Based on docking results
of kaempferol and SL0101, point and deletion truncation mutants
of RSK2 clearly showed that kaempferol binding to Val82 and Lys100
is required for the inhibitory effect of kaempferol against RSK2
activity (Figs. 4D and 5B and C). The MAPK signal transduction
network comprises a very complicated and highly interactive
series of phosphorylation cascades (16, 34). The most thoroughly
characterized MAPK family members include the ERKs, c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 proteins, which are regulated and
activated by MEK kinases or MAPK kinase kinases via MEK,

Figure 4. Kaempferol binds with the NTD
of RSK2. A and B, RSK2 binds with
kaempferol. Commercially available active
RSK2 (100 ng) or bacterial-expressed
RSK2 was mixed with 30 AL of
CNBr-kaempferol beads (50% slurry) for
2 h at 4jC. Beads were then washed and
RSK2 binding was visualized by Western
blotting with an RSK2 antibody. C,
kaempferol binds with the NTD of RSK2. To
identify the RSK2 domain that binds with
kaempferol, RSK2 proteins (200 ng) as
indicated (same molar ratio) were mixed
with 30 AL of CNBr-kaempferol beads (50%
slurry) at 4jC for 2 h. The binding proteins
were visualized by Western blotting with a
His-specific antibody or an RSK2 antibody.
D, RSK2 FL, but not NTD RSK2 or
RSK2-CTD alone, binds with kaempferol.
The indicated RSK2 expression vector was
transiently introduced into 293 cells.
Total cell lysates (200 Ag) were used for
CNBr-kaempferol binding and the bound
proteins were visualized by Western
blotting with a His-specific antibody.

MKK3/7, or MKK3/6. RSK2 is a member of the p90RSK family that
includes RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, RSK4, MSK1, and MSK2 (3, 4). Our
previous work indicated that RSK2 plays an important role in cell
proliferation, differentiation, and transformation and inhibits
apoptosis by interacting with multiple transcription factors or
other proteins, including p53 (13), NFAT3 (14), and histone H3
(13, 22). Therefore, finding a natural dietary compound that
inhibits RSK2 activity would be valuable and useful for chemopreventive application. In our previous study, we found that
kaempferol suppressed RSK2 activity in vitro and ex vivo (22) and
inhibited proliferation and cell transformation induced by tumor
promoters such as EGF or TPA (22). However, the molecular
mechanism(s) of the inhibitory effects of kaempferol is not yet fully
understood. In this study, we provide evidence that kaempferol
directly binds to the NTD RSK2 to prevent its activation.
Furthermore, we found that the RSK2 protein level was elevated
in cancer cell lines and tissues compared with normal cells and
tissues (Fig. 6). Kaempferol treatment suppressed proliferation

carcinoma, SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 melanomas, and HCT-116
colon cancer cells, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). The
overall results indicated that inhibition of RSK2 activity with
dietary natural compounds such as kaempferol might provide a
safe and effective chemopreventive application to suppress
redevelopment of cancer after primary treatment or intervention.
