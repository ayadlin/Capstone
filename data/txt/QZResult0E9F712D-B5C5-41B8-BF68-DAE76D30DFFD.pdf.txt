SUMMARY
Since apoptosis of infected cells can limit virus production and spread, some viruses have coopted prosurvival genes from the host. This includes the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gene BHRF1, a
homologue of human Bcl-2 proteins that block apoptosis and are associated with cancer.
Computational design and experimental optimization were used to generate a novel protein called
BINDI that binds BHRF1 with picomolar affinity. BINDI recognizes the hydrophobic cleft of
BHRF1 in a manner similar to other Bcl-2 protein interactions, but makes many additional
contacts to achieve exceptional affinity and specificity. BINDI induces apoptosis in EBV-infected
cancer lines, and when delivered with an antibody-targeted intracellular delivery carrier, BINDI
suppressed tumor growth and extended survival in a xenograft disease model of EBV-positive

INTRODUCTION
Following virus infection, cells may undergo apoptosis to prevent further virus spread in the
host. This has spurred viruses to evolve counteracting mechanisms to prevent host cell
death, and during latent infection these factors may contribute to the development of cancer.
In particular, there are multiple cancers associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), including
Burkitt's lymphoma (BL).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Apoptosis and cell survival are regulated by the homeostatic balance of B cell lymphoma-2
(Bcl-2) family proteins (reviewed in (Martinou and Youle, 2011)), which fall in to three
classes. The `executioners', Bak and Bax, initiate apoptosis by increasing mitochondrial
outer membrane permeability and facilitating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to
the cytosol, which activates downstream signaling. Six human prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins
(Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-B, Mcl-1, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibit this process. Counterbalancing these
are numerous proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, including Bim. These factors share a ~26
residue Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) motif, an amphipathic α-helical element which binds a
hydrophobic groove on the surface of the canonical Bcl-2 fold. Cellular stresses activate
proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, which bind and inhibit prosurvival Bcl-2 members, and
directly interact with Bak and Bax to favor mitochondrial permeabilization. Conversely,
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins dampen apoptotic triggers and enhance chemoresistance by
sequestering BH3-only proteins or directly inhibiting Bak and Bax. Increased expression of
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins is a common feature of many cancers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Epstein-Barr virus encodes a prosurvival Bcl-2 homologue, BHRF1, which prevents
lymphocyte apoptosis during initial infection by sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only
proteins (especially Bim), and interacting directly with the executioner Bak (Altmann and
Hammerschmidt, 2005; Desbien et al., 2009; Henderson et al., 1993; Kvansakul et al.,
2010). Even though BHRF1 is under the control of an early lytic cycle promoter, low levels
of constitutive expression have been observed in some cases of EBV-positive BL when the
virus is latent, and it has been speculated that BHRF1 may be a necessary viral factor for
lymphomagenesis (Kelly et al., 2009; Leao et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2010). However,
although EBV is one of the earliest viruses to be associated with human cancer, its
molecular mechanism of action remains unclear, in part because EBV-positive BLs can have
different expression profiles, suggesting the molecular etiology may not be universal (Kelly
et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2010).
In recent years, computation-based protein design has made considerable progress, including
the design of new hyperstable structures (Koga et al., 2012) and the creation of functional
sites within existing proteins as scaffolds (Fleishman et al., 2011; Procko et al., 2013).
However, except in a few rare instances (Correia et al., 2014; Lanci et al., 2012), the design
of new structures that are also functional is a largely unmet challenge. Here, we describe the
creation of a picomolar inhibitor of BHRF1 by designing a new protein de novo for optimum
interactions. The designed BHRF1 inhibitor triggers apoptosis in several EBV-positive

cancer lines, and when delivered with an antibody-targeted carrier system, the inhibitor
suppresses tumor progression and extends survival in an animal model of human EBVpositive lymphoma.

RESULTS
BHRF1-binding proteins created by grafting Bim-BH3 side chains to a helical scaffold

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins share a similar fold that resembles a cupped hand, with a
characteristic hydrophobic surface groove that clasps one side of an amphipathic BH3 motif
helix (Kvansakul et al., 2010; Martinou and Youle, 2011). Rigidifying BH3 peptides with
hydrocarbon staples, disulfides or lactam bridges on the non-interactive back side of the
helix can reduce the entropic cost of a partially-folded peptide acquiring a rigid helical
conformation upon binding, and improves BH3 peptide affinity (Azzarito et al., 2013). We
reasoned that building a folded structure around a BH3 peptide would similarly pre-stabilize
the bound conformation, but also provide additional interactions for increased affinity and
specificity. In previous work, interacting residues of the BH3 motif were grafted to the
surface of a minimal structured peptide, but after directed evolution these folded peptides
displayed only moderate affinity and specificity, and did not always bind to the correct site
on the target Bcl-2 protein (Chin and Schepartz, 2001; Gemperli et al., 2005). We instead
sought to incorporate the interacting residues of the BH3 motif onto an exposed surface of a
larger 3- or 4-helix bundle protein, which would thereby allow additional contacts for
increased affinity and specificity extending beyond the BH3 motif.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two computational design strategies were used. The first was a side chain grafting approach
onto existing natural proteins (Figure S1A online) (Correia et al., 2010; Ofek et al., 2010).
Three helical-bundle proteins were chosen as scaffolds with different sizes and shapes for
diversity: the small 3-helix protein Z (PDB 1LP1 (Hogbom et al., 2003)), a larger 3-helix
bundle derived from a bacterial ribosome recycling factor (3LHP chain S (Correia et al.,
2010)), and a 4-helix viral coat protein (3FBL (Goulet et al., 2009)). Beginning with the
crystal structure of BHRF1 bound to a Bim-BH3 peptide (Kvansakul et al., 2010), helical
regions within the scaffolds were structurally aligned to the Bim-BH3 helix. The scaffold
positions corresponding to Bim-BH3 residues which interact with BHRF1 were then
mutated to the Bim-BH3 amino acids. Next, scaffold residues surrounding the graft site were
redesigned to minimize the calculated energy of the modeled bound complex (Kuhlman et
al., 2003; Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). BHRF1 interface residues, which normally reach over
the backside of the Bim-BH3 helix, were simultaneously repacked to alternative low energy
rotamers compatible with the new designed interface. From six different graft sites on the
three scaffolds, three proteins (BbpG2.D, BbpG3.D and BbpG4.D) were obtained with
moderate affinities for BHRF1 (apparent KDs of approximately 60 to 80 nM as evaluated
using yeast surface display titrations, Figure 1A, Tables 1 and S1). These affinities are
weaker than the wild-type interaction of Bim-BH3 with BHRF1, which has an apparent KD
of 12 nM (Table 1), probably reflecting non-optimal backbone conformations and/or slightly
unfavorable designed interactions outside the core motif. To evaluate the importance of the
additional designed interactions outside the core motif, control designs were produced in
which Bim-BH3 binding residues were transplanted to the scaffolds without redesign of the

surrounding surface. These control designs did not bind BHRF1 (Table S1), indicating that
computational design of novel interactions outside the core motif was necessary.

Creating new proteins for optimized interactions with the BHRF1 ligand-binding groove

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Designed proteins from side chain grafting are limited by the assumed rigid backbone of the
scaffold. To escape this constraint, a second design strategy was used that builds protein
structures de novo using proteins of known structure only as topology guides (Correia et al.,
2014). The Bim-BH3 helix from the complex with BHRF1 was taken as a folding nucleus,
and helical bundle structures were assembled around it using fragments from the PDB,
followed by cycles of sequence design and structure minimization. Cα-Cα atom-pair
distances from the topology guide constrained the assembling protein to within 3.0 Å root
mean square deviation (RMSD) of the guide. Independent runs of this stochastic design
protocol gave an ensemble of structural homologues, roughly centered on the guide scaffold
structure (Figure S1B). This protocol was previously applied to the design of an
immunogenic protein incorporating a viral epitope, but in that case the incorporated epitope
provided all necessary interactions with a target antibody (Correia et al., 2014). Here, the
incorporated Bim-BH3 motif provides only a fraction of the interaction surface
(approximately 40%), with potential for many additional contacts across an expansive
interface.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Each designed protein in the ensemble was docked to the BHRF1 surface via alignment of
the incorporated Bim-BH3 motif, and the surrounding interface residues were optimized as
described above. The designs were filtered both for stability of the monomer and for
interface quality. From thousands of computer-assembled proteins, a small number of
designs were selected for further manual modifications, synthetic E. coli codon-optimized
genes were constructed, and those proteins that were expressed and soluble in E. coli were
tested by yeast surface display for binding to BHRF1 (Table S2; yeast surface display allows
rapid measurement of approximate affinities and is a powerful technology for later directed
evolution). Two designs with folds based on PDB 3LHP(S) were found to bind BHRF1 with
apparent KDs of 58–60 nM (BbpD04 and BbpD07; Figure 1A and Table 1). These designs
were `seeded' by a fifteen-residue fragment of the Bim-BH3 motif of which nine side chains
contacting the BHRF1 surface were kept fixed. Other residues, primarily on the backside of
the motif and buried in the protein core, were designed to minimize the calculated potential
energy. The equivalent 3LHP(S) fixed backbone graft (design BbpG1.D, Table S1) had
numerous steric clashes between the scaffold backbone and BHRF1 surface in the
computational model (described later), and failed to bind BHRF1.
In silico folding probability correlates with binding activity
The success rate for designing functional proteins is low, and design calculations are often
followed by substantial human intervention to choose and modify the designs prior to
experimental validation (Figure S2A). To investigate the factors distinguishing working
from non-working designs and evaluate the importance of human intervention, we
characterized BHRF1 binding to a set of computational designs generated as described for
BbpD04 and BbpD07, but without any human modifications. Seventy-four designs were
displayed on yeast and sorted with a single round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting

(FACS) for surface protein expression and BHRF1 binding. Deep sequencing revealed that
five designs (Indexes-00 to 04) were highly expressed and enriched after sorting for BHRF1
interaction (Figures 1B and S2A–D, Table S3); BHRF1 binding was confirmed on clonal
yeast populations (Figure S2E). Standard computational metrics for assessing interface
quality or monomer stability did not distinguish the working designs (Figure S2F–K).
Instead, we found that BHRF1 binding strongly correlated with the extent to which the
designed sequences folded to the designed structures in ab initio structure prediction
calculations (Figure 1C and S2L). Rather than a single calculated metric from a static
representation of the structure, ab initio structure prediction generates tens of thousands of
conformations from stochastic folding simulations. Amongst the designs that bind BHRF1,
the closer the predicted conformations are to the designed structure (i.e. lower RMSD in
Figure 1C), the lower their calculated energy and hence the higher the probability of
correctly folding. This observation suggests that the primary shortcomings of inactive
designs are improper folding and designed state instability, rather than the details of the
designed protein-protein interface.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Enhanced BHRF1 binding affinity and specificity through improved electrostatic
complementarity
To illuminate BHRF1 biology, the designed protein must not only bind with high affinity,
but do so specifically. Design BbpD04, a de novo designed protein without sequence
homologues identified by BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), bound BHRF1 with higher affinity
(apparent KD = 58 ± 3 nM) than all human prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins except Mcl-1 (Table
1), and was chosen for further optimization. The computed electric field (Baker et al., 2001)
experienced by BbpD04 when bound to BHRF1 is markedly more negative than when
bound to Mcl-1 (Figure 2A–B). Nine point substitutions were made to eight residues of
BbpD04 to specifically increase electrostatic complementarity for BHRF1. Six decreased the
KD(BHRF1)/KD(Mcl-1) ratio as predicted (Table S4). The variant BbpD04.1 containing the
best two point mutations (E48R and E65R), together with a third compensatory mutation
(K31E) to preserve a putative stabilizing salt-bridge, bound BHRF1 with tighter affinity
(Table 1).
Optimization of affinity, specificity and stability

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Error-prone PCR mutagenesis of BbpD04.1 followed by FACS for BHRF1 binding in the
presence of unlabeled human Bcl-2 proteins to favor specificity identified two mutations at
the designed interface (H104R, predicted to enhance electrostatic complementarity, and
N62S, predicted to improve specificity based on sequence-fitness landscape mapping
described below), and three mutations distal from the interface that might alter protein
stability. I21L slightly alters packing in the hydrophobic core, Q79L increases hydrophobic
interactions buttressing the second connecting loop, and L84Q forms a stabilizing hydrogen
bond to the loop backbone. The substitutions were recombined in a combinatorial library,
and FACS followed by analysis of expression in E. coli identified a clone, BbpD04.2 (with
four mutations, see Figure 2C), that was monodisperse and monomeric by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) after protein purification from E. coli (Figure S3). To enable sitespecific chemical coupling for later characterization, the single internal cysteine of

BbpD04.2 was removed by mutagenesis (mutant C103A, called BbpD04.3; Table 1 and
Figure S4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To probe the sequence-fitness landscape of the designed protein, site-specific saturation
mutagenesis was used to independently diversify every codon of the BbpD04.3 gene to
NNK (N is any base, K is G or T), producing a library of (116 positions) × (20 amino acids
+ stop codon) = 2,436 protein variants. The variants were expressed on yeast and the library
was sorted by a single round of FACS for BHRF1 affinity (Figure 2D) or affinity-andspecificity (unlabeled human Bcl-2 proteins were included as competitors; Figure 2E). DNA
was extracted from the naive and post-sorted yeast populations, and the BbpD04.3 coding
region was deep sequenced. The ratio of the frequencies of each protein variant in the presorted and post-sorted populations reports on the effect of each substitution on affinity/
specificity fitness.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The comprehensive BbpD04.3 affinity sequence-fitness landscape reveals the critical nature
of the incorporated Bim-BH3 motif, with most substitutions of interface residues depleted
(Figure 2D). In addition, substitutions to proline, which can break regular helical secondary
structure, are depleted across the first, second and third helical spans of the designed helical
bundle fold. Substitutions to aspartate, a short and charged amino acid, are depleted within
the hydrophobic core as anticipated. The BbpD04.3 affinity-specificity sequence-fitness
landscape, in which unlabeled Bcl-2 proteins were included as competitors for BHRF1
binding, is similar (Figure 2E). Notably, several mutations of Asn62, including N62S
described in detail later, were found to selectively increase BHRF1 specificity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Bacterial expression of BbpD04.3 was very low, limiting the quantity and purity that could
be purified for biochemical applications. To improve expression, twenty-nine BbpD04.3
point mutants with positive enrichment ratios in either the affinity or affinity-specificity
sequence-fitness landscapes were expressed in E. coli and analyzed for increased soluble
protein levels (Figure S5A). Nine mutations were identified: W3A and W3P increase helical
propensity of the initiating residue in the starting helix; and I13Q, F28L, M33R, F61Y,
W49E/Y and M46E decrease surface hydrophobicity. These substitutions perhaps reduce
misfolding or aggregation, thereby reducing clearance of the protein by the quality control
machinery. Because the mutations are generally surface-exposed at distinct sites on a long
helical bundle, we reasoned they could likely be combined without negative interference
(Figure S5B). A BbpD04.3 variant with seven mutations (Figure S5C) had significantly
increased bacterial expression and improved specificity (Figure 2G and Table 1). This
variant is named BHRF1-INhibiting Design acting Intracellularly (BINDI). A summary of
all mutations introduced in the original design is provided in Figure 2I.
The increased affinity for BHRF1 following in vitro evolution correlates with enhanced
protein stability. Both BbpD04.3 and BINDI undergo cooperative unfolding at high
concentrations (> 3 M) of the chemical denaturant guanidinium hydrochloride measured by
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Figure 2H). However, the original design, BbpD04,
has nearly linear loss of CD signal over a wide concentration range of guanidinium
hydrochloride (Figure 2H). The absence of a cooperative melting transition is associated
with molten globules that lack a rigid core or single native conformation. While BbpD04,

BbpD04.3 and BINDI have high thermostability and retain partly α-helical CD spectra at
95°C, only evolved BbpD04.3 and BINDI fully renature when the heated proteins are cooled
(Figure S5D–G). Further, the original BbpD04 design is sensitive to rapid hydrolysis by
proteases, which require unfolded substrate backbone to access the enzyme active site,
whereas BINDI and BbpD04.3 are resistant (Figure S5H).
BINDI binds BHRF1 with high affinity and specificity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Apparent dissociation constants by yeast surface display are useful approximations, but may
be artificially tight due to avidity effects or ligand rebinding to a dense receptor surface, or
may be artificially weak if binding equilibrium is not reached. The BINDI•BHRF1
interaction was therefore further characterized by alternative methods. BINDI eluted as a
higher molecular weight complex by SEC when mixed with BHRF1 in solution, whereas
BINDI L54E with a knockout mutation in the designed interface did not (Figures 3A and
S3). Using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) to measure the kinetic rate constants,
BINDI•BHRF1 was found to form a very tight complex (KD 220 ± 50 pM) with a slow
dissociation rate (koff = [2.8 ± 0.9] × 10−5 s−1) (Figure 3B and 3D). BINDI has high
specificity for BHRF1; the dissociation constants for human Bcl-2 family members are
much weaker. BINDI bound human Mcl-1 with KD 40 ± 10 nM (180-fold increase
compared to BHRF1), Bcl-2 with KD 2.1 ± 0.1 μM (10,000-fold increase), Bcl-w with KD
870 ± 40 nM (4,000-fold increase), Bfl-1 with KD 2.6 ± 0.8 μM (12,000-fold increase), BclB with KD > 10 μM (> 45,000-fold increase) and Bcl-XL with KD 810 ± 80 nM (4,000-fold
increase). The N62S variant of BINDI was found to have even higher specificity for BHRF1
versus Mcl-1, the closest competitor (Figure 3E). Compared to the measured affinities of
Bcl-2 proteins for Bim-BH3 (Figure 3C) and to other published values (Caria et al., 2012;
Dutta et al., 2013; Dutta et al., 2010; Gemperli et al., 2005; Kvansakul et al., 2010; Lessene
et al., 2013; Tse et al., 2008), the affinity and specificity of BINDI for BHRF1 is
considerably greater than any previously described BHRF1 ligand, and is similar to or
exceeds that of any other protein, peptide or drug designed to specifically bind a Bcl-2
family protein.
The crystal structure of BINDI•BHRF1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The crystal structure of the BINDI•BHRF1 complex was determined at 2.05 Å resolution
(Figure 4A and Table S5) and found to closely match the design model. The asymmetric
unit contains two nearly identical copies of BINDI-bound BHRF1; the analysis presented
here corresponds to one copy of the complex (Figure S6A–B). The backbones of the crystal
structure and the original BbpD04•BHRF1 model align with a Cα-Cα RMSD of 1.06 Å
(Figure 4B). The designed core and interface regions were modeled accurately, while
connecting loops at the ends of the helical bundle deviate slightly from the computational
prediction (Figure 4C). Excluding flexible termini, only two regions differ substantially
from the model; BHRF1 loop 74–78 and BHRF1 loop 92–97 are located further away from
the interface in the crystal structure by 3 to 5 Å (Figure 4C and S6C–D). Our computational
modeling assumed that the target BHRF1 backbone was rigid, and therefore changes to the
target structure could not be anticipated. These regions have been found to be flexible in
BHRF1 and other Bcl-2 family members to accommodate the binding of different BH3
motif ligands (Fire et al., 2010; Kvansakul et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2009).

BINDI incorporates the Bim-BH3 motif within a de novo designed fold guided by the
topology of PDB 3LHP chain S. As noted earlier, the direct graft of Bim-BH3 interaction
residues to the equivalent site within the 3LHP(S) scaffold (design BbpG1) failed to bind
BHRF1, even after extensive design of the surrounding interaction surface (design
BbpG1.D; Table S1). While 3LHP(S) is structurally similar to BINDI, it is nonetheless a
poor steric fit for the BHRF1 binding groove in this design protocol. Aligning the graft site
within 3LHP(S) to the Bim-BH3 motif of BINDI in the BINDI•BHRF1 crystal structure
shows that the C-terminal helix of the grafted design comes too close to the BHRF1 surface,
such that side chains would clash (Figure 4D). An alignment of the crystal structure, design
model and guide scaffold over the Bim-BH3 incorporation site shows that the crystal
structure is closer to the design model than to the guide scaffold (Figure 4E). The RMSD
between the crystal and design models is 1.37 Å, and between the crystal and guide scaffold
is 1.86 Å. Thus, the design process succeeded in identifying a sequence that folds more
closely to the designed model than to the structure of the initial guide scaffold.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Compared to the native Bim-BH3 interaction, BINDI contacts an additional 404 Å2 on the
surface of BHRF1 (Figure 4F–K). Residues from the Bim fragment that seeded design
account for just 587 Å2 of the BINDI surface buried in the complex, whereas designed
residues account for 839 Å2 (Figure 4H). Only two residues at the periphery of the
incorporated Bim-BH3 motif changed during affinity maturation (the conservative W49Y
and F61Y substitutions), while all residues in the core of the motif remained unchanged
(Figure S6E–G). Introducing these two mutations into a Bim-BH3 peptide, or mutating the
Bim-BH3 peptide at all five positions within the BH3 region that distinguish BbpD04 from
specific BINDI, failed to achieve the high affinity and specificity of BINDI (Figure S6H–I).
Likewise, excised peptides from BbpD04 and BINDI that could be considered equivalent to
a 26-residue BH3 motif, while partially specific, again lack the affinity and specificity of
BINDI (Figure S6H–I). The extraordinary specificity of BINDI is therefore accomplished
through interactions across an expansive interface, extending well beyond the central BimBH3 residues used to seed design.
BINDI triggers apoptosis preferentially in EBV-infected cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We tested whether inhibition of BHRF1 via steric occlusion of the BH3-binding groove with
BINDI could induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release in the EBV-positive BL cell line
Ramos-AW. Ramos-AW expresses BHRF1 at very low levels (Leao et al., 2007), and
therefore presents a challenging biological target that likely expresses much higher levels of
off-target endogenous Bcl-2 family proteins. BINDI was applied to mitochondria isolated
from both Ramos-AW and the EBV-negative parental line Ramos (Andersson and Lindahl,
1976). BINDI elicited greater cytochrome c release from Ramos-AW mitochondria (Figure
5A), indicating an EBV-associated factor is likely a BINDI target. Strikingly, the nonspecific Bim-BH3 peptide had opposite behavior; mitochondria from EBV-negative Ramos
cells were more sensitive to Bim-BH3 treatment than those from EBV-positive Ramos-AW
cells. Indeed, EBV-positive cell lines are widely reported as more resistant to nonselective
apoptotic stimuli (Ishii et al., 1995; Kvansakul et al., 2010; Leao et al., 2007), making the
enhanced activity of BINDI against Ramos-AW cells all the more significant.

While weaker than the picomolar affinity of BINDI for BHRF1, the moderate affinity for
Mcl-1 is likely the reason BINDI still triggers apoptosis in the EBV-negative Ramos cell
line. It is possible that the enhanced toxicity of BINDI towards Ramos-AW reflects
increased Mcl-1-dependency in this line, rather than expression of EBV BHRF1. To rule out
this possibility, we tested variant BINDI N62S with even greater specificity. Asn62 of
BINDI hydrogen bonds to the N-terminus of BHRF1 helix α6, and serine at this position is
predicted to similarly interact at the interface (Figure S7B). BINDI N62S still binds BHRF1
with tight affinity (KD 160 ± 80 pM), but with better specificity (Table 1 and Figure 3E); in
particular, the affinity for Mcl-1 is diminished six-fold (KD 230 ± 40 nM). BINDI N62S has
even greater discrimination between Ramos and Ramos-AW cells (Figure 5B). The
enhanced activity of BINDI to initiate cytochrome c release preferentially in EBV-positive
cells is therefore almost certainly due to BHRF1 inhibition.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Expression profiling of EBV-positive BLs has revealed distinct subgroups (Kelly et al.,
2013; Watanabe et al., 2010), and BHRF1 may not be important for cell survival in all cases.
Including Ramos and Ramos-AW, mitochondria were isolated from five EBV-positive and
three EBV-negative B cell lines. Bim-BH3 peptide triggered cytochrome c release, whereas
the inactive guide scaffold 3LHP(S) had no effect (Figure S7C). Incubation with BINDI
N62S induced high cytochrome c release in three EBV-positive lines (Figure 5B–C): BL
lines Ramos-AW and Daudi, and B-prolymphocytic leukemia JVM-13. Two of the EBVpositive lines had low levels of cytochrome c release similar to EBV-negative cells, despite
transcribing the BHRF1 gene (Figure S7C): BL line Raji and mantle cell lymphoma line
JVM-2. Hence only some EBV-positive cancer lines appear to be dependent on BHRF1 for
survival.

BINDI was genetically fused with a C-terminal antennapedia peptide for non-specific
cellular uptake and intracellular delivery in vitro. BINDI-antennapedia applied to the growth
medium at 4 μM selectively killed 40% of EBV-positive Ramos-AW cells, with no
measurable death of EBV-negative Ramos cells (Figure S7D). Antennapedia-fused proteins
concentrate in endocytic organelles and escape to the cytosol with low efficiency (Duvall et
al., 2010). To enhance endosomal escape, BINDI-antennapedia was conjugated via a
terminal cysteine to a diblock copolymer carrier, Pol300, comprising a hydrophilic first
block and a pH-responsive endosomolytic second block (Convertine et al., 2010; Duvall et
al., 2010; Manganiello et al., 2012). A lower 2 μM dose of BINDI-antennapedia induced
60% cell death preferentially in Ramos-AW cells when conjugated to the Pol300 polymeric
carrier for enhanced cytosolic delivery (Figure 5D). Our data suggest inhibition of BHRF1
may effectively kill EBV-positive BL.
Treatment of EBV-positive B cell lymphoma in a xenograft mouse model by intracellular
delivery of BINDI
Intracellular delivery of proteins in vivo is challenging, and there are no current intracellular
protein drugs available clinically. We developed an antibody-micelle formulation to deliver
BINDI to intracellular targets in an EBV-positive human lymphoma disease model. BINDI
was coupled via a C-terminal cysteine to a diblock copolymer (Pol950); similar copolymers
have been shown to facilitate cytosolic release of fluorescent peptides (Duvall et al., 2010)

and have been coupled to antibodies for cell-targeting (Berguig et al., 2012). The
copolymer's hydrophilic first block was composed of polyethylene glycol methacrylate
(MA) to improve safety and pharmacokinetic properties, pyridyldisulfide MA for cysteine
conjugation to BINDI, and biotin-hydroxylethyl MA for coupling to streptavidin-antiCD19
(αCD19; human monoclonal CAT-13.1E10-SA). The endosomolytic pH-responsive second
block was composed of diethylaminoethyl MA and butyl MA. Copolymer:αCD19:BINDI
forms micelles that disassociate at endosomal pH to expose the membrane-destabilizing
segments (Figure 6A). CD19 is a rapidly internalizing surface antigen on B cells, and the
αCD19-complex is thought to be endocytosed followed by endosomal escape and protein
drug release in the reducing environment of the cytosol.
Subcutaneous Ramos-AW xenograft tumors were established in nude BALB/c mice. The
mice were treated intravenously on days 0, 3 and 6 with antibody-micelles coupled to the
inactive scaffold 3LHP(S) or to BINDI. Thirty minutes prior to each treatment,
cyclophosphamide (CTX) and bortezomib (BTZ) were injected intraperitoneally at
subtherapeutic doses to prime cells for apoptosis (O'Connor et al., 2006). The treatments
were nontoxic, with no substantial change in mouse body weight (Figure S7E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The intracellular delivery of BINDI to the B cell lymphoma xenograft slowed tumor
progression and prolonged survival. Tumors grew rapidly in the untreated/PBS and chemoonly control groups (Figure 6B–C), with mean tumor sizes of 1080 ± 500 mm3 and 680 ±
410 mm3, respectively, at day 11 when the first mice were euthanized due to excessive
tumor burden. Both scaffold 3LHP(S) and BINDI treatment groups had reduced tumor sizes
due to the therapeutic effects of αCD19 coupled to the micelle carrier, but BINDI
substantially slowed tumor growth compared to the scaffold control, especially during the
treatment cycle (140 ± 60 mm3 vs. 330 ± 140 mm3 at day 11, unpaired t test P = 0.003,
Figure 6D–E). Lifespan was extended in the BINDI-treated mice compared to the scaffold
treatment (log-rank test P = 0.006), with median survival of 15 days for PBS treatment, 16
days for chemo-only, and 21 days for 3LHP(S) treatment, extending to 24 days following
BINDI treatment (Figure 6F). Future work is needed to determine the fraction of proteins
delivered with this new delivery carrier that are internalized and directly engage intracellular
targets. Nonetheless, our data represent the first demonstration that a de novo
computationally designed protein can reduce tumor growth in a preclinical model.

DISCUSSION
By breaking free of the conformational constraints imposed by repurposing pre-existing
scaffolds and instead building a new protein with structure tailored for the target surface, a
remarkably tight and specific binder of the EBV apoptosis regulator BHRF1 was designed.
The elevated toxicity of the engineered BINDI protein towards EBV-positive cancer lines
supports the hypothesis that BHRF1 is necessary for survival in at least some EBVassociated cancers.
BINDI has a structure and amino acid sequence found after computationally filtering
thousands of potential designed conformations for optimum interactions with BHRF1. The
crystal structure is very close to the BINDI computational model, with the orientations of

helices differing from the guide scaffold in ways critical for activity. The ability to customtailor the backbone conformation to the challenge at hand was critical to our success in
achieving very high affinity and specificity.
Protein structure and function are closely coupled, and our results demonstrate the
importance of designing for stability in addition to optimizing the binding interface. Designs
with BHRF1 binding activity had energy minima near the intended target structure in ab
initio structure calculations, and directed evolution of BbpD04 to enhance affinity
introduced mutations far from the interface that increased protein stability. Direct in silico
screening for a deep energy minimum around the desired conformation could considerably
increase the success rate of protein design efforts.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we demonstrate that BINDI can slow progression of EBV-positive B cell lymphoma
and prolong survival in a human xenograft mouse model. The suppression of tumor growth
during treatment with BINDI provides proof-of-principle results that a designer protein toxin
can be antibody-targeted and effective in vivo. Further optimization of dosing, targeting and
the carrier may all increase therapeutic efficacy, and alternative designed toxins with
destructive enzymatic activity would boost potency. Designer toxins with high potency and
specificity could provide the basis for a next generation of antibody-drug conjugates for the
treatment of cancer.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Protein Design and Purification
Proteins were designed using the ROSETTA software suite, and designed protein genes
were synthesized by oligo assembly or by commercial suppliers. Designed proteins (cloned
into pET29b (Novagen)) were purified with C-terminal 6His-tags from E. coli BL21(DE3)
by NiNTA-affinity chromatography (Qiagen) and SEC (GE Healthcare). Target Bcl-2
proteins had C-terminal avi-6His tags and were similarly purified from E. coli, followed by
enzymatic biotinylation using BirA (Avidity). Biotinylated proteins were further purified by
additional rounds of NiNTA-affinity chromatography and SEC. All purified proteins were
concentrated with ultra-filtration centrifugal devices (Sartorius), snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Yeast Surface Display
Design optimization was by yeast surface display. Designed protein genes were cloned into
plasmid pETCON (Fleishman et al., 2011), and expressed as fusions with N-terminal Aga2p
for surface attachment and a C-terminal myc-tag in the EBY100 strain. Surface expression
was detected with anti-myc-FITC (Immunology Consultants Laboratory), while binding to
biotinylated Bcl-2 proteins after co-incubation for 1–4 h at 22 °C in phosphate-buffered
saline was detected with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Invitrogen). Yeast were sorted with a
BD Influx cell sorter. Gene sequences were diversified either by assembly of degenerate
oligos, by over-lapping PCR for generating the site-specific saturation mutagenesis library
(Procko et al., 2013), or by error-prone PCR with an average error rate of 1.3 a.a.
substitutions per clone using GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies).

Crystallization and Structure Determination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Untagged BINDI and C-terminal 6his-BHRF1 were co-purified from E. coli lysate via
NiNTA-affinity chromatography and SEC. Crystals of the complex were grown by vapor
diffusion after mixing 1:1 drops of protein with reservoir (8–12% PEG8000, 100 mM TrisCl pH 8.5, 200 mM MgCl2), and were cryopreserved with 18–20 % glycerol in mother
liquid prior to flash freezing. Data sets were collected with a Rigaku MicroMax-007HF
rotating anode home source and at beam line BL 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The structure was determined by molecular
replacement with chain A of PDB 2WH6 and a computational model of BINDI.
Apoptosis Assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cytochrome c release was measured by ELISA (Life Technologies) from isolated
mitochondria after treating with the indicated peptides/proteins for 0.5 h at room
temperature. For cell viability studies, protein and protein-polymer conjugates were
incubated with Ramos or Ramos-AW cells for 24 h, and viability measured using a CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, MTS (Promega). For these studies, BimBH3 peptide (sequence Ac-CMRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYARR-ON) was synthesized
by solid phase synthesis and purified.
Diblock Copolymers
Pol950 and Pol300 diblock copolymers were synthesized by reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer. Pol300 is a 25,000 Da diblock copolymer composed of 95%
polyethylene glycol MA (300 Da) and 5% pyridyl disulfide MA in the first block, and 60%
diethylaminoethyl MA and 40% butyl MA in the second block. Pol950 is a 44,000 Da
diblock copolymer composed of 80% polyethylene glycol MA (950 Da), 10% pyridyl
disulfide MA, and 10 % biotin-hydroxyethyl MA in the first block, and 60%
diethylaminoethyl MA and 40% butyl MA in the second block.
Xenograft Disease Model

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BALB/c nu/nu mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were housed under protocols approved by the
FHCRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ramos-AW cells (107 cells / 200 μl)
were injected in the right flank (day -6) and tumors grew for 6 days to a volume of 50 mm3.
Mice with similar sized tumors were sorted randomly into treatment groups (n = 8 to 10). On
days 0, 3, and 6, mice were injected intraperitoneally with CTX (35 mg/kg) and BTZ (0.5
mg/kg). After 0.5 h, mice were injected via tail vein with conjugates at a dose of 15 mg/kg
(αCD19; clone CAT-13.1E10 produced in the monoclonal production facility at FHCRC),
300 mg/kg (Pol950) and 105 mg/kg (BINDI or 3LHP). Body weight was monitored for
toxicity and tumor sizes were measured while blinded to treatment groups. Mice were
euthanized when tumors reached a volume of 1250 mm3.

(A) Computational models of individually-tested designed proteins (orange) that bind
BHRF1 (green). The crystal structure of BHRF1 bound to Bim-BH3 (blue) is shown at left
for comparison. BbpG designs are from side chain grafting, and BbpD designs are de novo
assembled proteins. Apparent affinities (mean ± SE, n = 3–6) are from yeast display
titrations. See Figure S1, and Tables S1 and S2. An archive file of designed structures is
provided in Supplemental Information online.
(B) Seventy-four computationally designed proteins without human modifications
(Indexes-01 to 74) were included in a yeast display library. BbpD04 (Index-00) was
included as a positive control. The library was sorted for cells expressing surface protein
(lane 1), for the 2% of cells with highest expression (lane 2), and for cells showing binding
signal after incubation with 100 nM (lane 3) or 400 nM BHRF1 (lane 4). The gene
frequencies in the sorted population were divided by their frequencies in the naive library to
calculate a log2 enrichment ratio, plotted from −4 (i.e. depleted, red) to +4 (i.e. enriched,
green). See Table S3.
(C) Histogram of the mean RMSD between the ten lowest energy structures found in ab
initio structure prediction calculations and the intended designed structure for each of the
sets of designs in (B). Designs with computed energy minima near the designed target
conformation have a higher probability of binding BHRF1. See Figure S2.

(A) Computational model of BHRF1 (light green ribbon) bound to design BbpD04
(transparent surface over a grey ribbon). The electrostatic potential from BHRF1 is shown
on the BbpD04 surface (red, −2 kT/e to blue, +2 kT/e; calculated using the Adaptive
Poisson-Boltzmann Solver built in ROSETTA). Mutations E48R and E65R (insets) decrease
electrostatic repulsion in regions where the field from BHRF1 is negative.
(B) Same as in (A), with Mcl-1 in place of BHRF1. E48 and E65 are now in regions that
border positive potential from Mcl-1. The Mcl-1•BbpD04 model was generated by
superposition of the BbpD04 binding site to Bim-BH3 bound to Mcl-1 in crystal structure
2PQK, followed by rotamer repacking and side chain/backbone minimization in ROSETTA.
See Table S4.
(C) The four additional mutations in BbpD04.2 (dark blue sticks) are shown on the
computational model of BbpD04.1 (orange) bound to BHRF1 (green). Three mutations are
distant from the interface. See Figure S3 and S4.
(D) Sequence-fitness landscape. All single amino acid substitutions of BbpD04.3 were
expressed in a yeast display library. The 1% of cells with highest binding signal for 400 pM
biotinylated BHRF1 relative to surface expression were collected by FACS. Plotted for each
substitution is the log2 enrichment ratio from −3.5 (depleted, orange) to +3.5 (enriched,

Figure 3. BINDI binds BHRF1 with high affinity and specificity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) BINDI or knockout mutant BINDI L54E were mixed with BHRF1 and separated by
SEC.
(B) Biotinylated BHRF1 was immobilized to a BLI sensor and the interaction with BINDI
was measured at the indicated concentrations.
(C–E) BLI kinetic analysis of interactions between immobilized Bcl-2 proteins and soluble
Bim-BH3 fused to the C-terminus of maltose-binding protein (C), BINDI (D) and BINDI
N62S (E). Red labels on broken diagonal lines indicate the corresponding affinities / KD.
Plotted are means ± SD from 4–6 experiments.

Figure 4. The crystal structure of BINDI-bound BHRF1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Electron density at 2.0 σ (blue mesh) in the region of the Bim-BH3 incorporation site.
The crystallographic model of BINDI (orange) bound to BHRF1 (green) is superimposed on
the original starting computational model of BbpD04•BHRF1 (grey). Residues of BINDI
and BHRF1 are labeled black and green, respectively, and residues of BbpD04 prior to
affinity maturation that differ are indicated in parentheses. See Figure S6.
(B) The crystal structure of BINDI bound to BHRF1 superimposed on the original
BbpD04•BHRF1 model.
(C) Agreement between the crystal structure and computational model is represented from
low (thin blue tubing) to higher Cα-Cα RMSD (thick red tubing).
(D) Slice through the crystal structure of BINDI (orange ribbon) bound to BHRF1 (green
ribbon with grey surface). The guiding scaffold 3LHP(S) (dark blue) is aligned to BINDI at
the Bim-BH3 incorporation site. A direct graft of the BH3 motif into 3LHP(S) at this
position causes clashes elsewhere with the BHRF1 surface.
(E) Aligned ribbon traces of BINDI from the BHRF1•BINDI crystal structure in orange; the
computational model of BINDI in grey; and the crystal structure of the guiding scaffold
3LHP(S) in dark blue. The three structures are aligned at the Bim-BH3 incorporation site on
the middle helix in the back. The upper magnified insets show the agreement between core
residue conformations in the BINDI computational model versus the crystal structure. The
lower magnified insets show that the core residues of BINDI are distinct in both identity and
position from those in the guiding scaffold. When aligned at the Bim-BH3 incorporation
site, the crystal structure is closer to the design model than the guiding scaffold.
(F) Crystal structure of BINDI (orange) bound to BHRF1 (green).
(G) The surface of BHRF1, in the same orientation as in (F), with the buried contact surface
in BHRF1•BINDI colored blue.
(H) The surface of BINDI, rotated 180º compared to the orientation in (F), with the buried
contact surface in BHRF1•BINDI colored. Buried residues whose identities were taken from

the incorporated Bim-BH3 fragment are magenta. Buried residues that were designed are
blue.
(I) The crystal structure (PDB 2WH6) of Bim-BH3 (blue) bound to BHRF1 (green). Buried
surface areas are calculated based on the 22 ordered residues of Bim built into the electron
density (a 26-residue Bim-BH3 peptide was crystallized with BHRF1 (Kvansakul et al.,
2010)).
(J) The surface of BHRF1, in the same orientation as in (I), with the buried contact surface
in BHRF1•Bim-BH3 colored blue.
(K) The surface of Bim-BH3, rotated 180º compared to the orientation in (I), with the buried
contact surface in BHRF1•Bim-BH3 colored blue.

Figure 5. BINDI triggers apoptosis in EBV-positive B cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Cytochrome c release from mitochondria harvested from Ramos (EBV-negative, grey)
or Ramos-AW cells (EBV-positive, crimson) treated with Bim-BH3 peptide (broken line) or
BINDI (solid line). Mean ± SD, n = 4, for panels A–C. See Figure S7.
(B) Cytochrome c release from Ramos and Ramos-AW mitochondria treated with 10 μM
BINDI or BINDI N62S.
(C) Mitochondria were harvested from EBV-negative and positive lines and cytochrome c
release was measured after treatment with 10 μM BINDI N62S.
(D) Cells were incubated with sub-lethal doses (2 μM) of antennapedia peptide-fused BINDI
or 3LHP(S). Diblock copolymer Pol300 was conjugated to the proteins for enhanced
endosomal escape. Cell viability (mean ± SD, n = 3) was measured after 24 hours.

Figure 6. Treatment of EBV-positive B cell lymphoma xenograft tumors by intracellular delivery
of BINDI in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Schematic representation of the copolymer-based treatment. Pol950 has stabilizing
(green) and endosomolytic (red) blocks and forms a micelle at physiological pH. The
stabilizing block couples to αCD19 and BINDI. Nude mice with subcutaneous Ramos-AW
xenografts were treated on days 0, 3 and 6 with Pol950 (300 mg/kg) : αCD19 (15 mg/kg) :
BINDI or 3LHP(S) (105 mg/kg). A maximum tolerated dose study determined this level of
BINDI was nontoxic. Mice were injected 30 minutes prior to each treatment with CTX (35
mg/ml) and BTZ (0.5 mg/ml).
(B–E) Tumor growth is plotted for each individual mouse until day 11 when the first mice
are euthanized. (B) PBS control treatment, black, n = 8; (C) chemo-only, grey, n = 9; (D)
3LHP(S)-copolymer treatment, green, n = 9; (E) BINDI-copolymer treatment, orange, n =
10.
(F) Kaplan-Meier survival plot. There is a significant increase in survival with treatment
(log-rank test χ2 = 46, P < 0.0001). See Figure S7E.
